<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING A CONFLICT, SOME RETROSPECTION, A PICTURE, AN
ATTEMPT AT AN ATONEMENT, AND ANOTHER AT AN IMPOSITION.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH Charles betrayed no &s;ymptoms of un|ea&s;ine&s;s in his
face when he left the room, after the adventure at the inn, perhaps no heart
ever was torn with more poignant di&s;tre&s;s. Love, prudence, and di&s;dain
a&s;&s;ailed his heart at once, and he went to bed ab&s;orbed in a conflict of
wretchedne&s;s, com|pared to which his la&s;t &s;leeple&s;s reflections in the
pri&s;on at Lyons were rapture.</P>
<P>At that time his con&s;cious innocence and the <PB N="6" REF="4"> wrongs that were done him rou&s;ed his hone&s;t forti|tude till it
towered &s;uperior to all po&s;&s;ible con&s;e|quences. Now mark the
difference: After taking the re&s;olution, upon the mo&s;t laudable grounds, of
never holding communication with tho&s;e who had traduced him, after fortifying
him&s;elf again&s;t all the bewitching power of Annette's charms, after
&s;u&s;|taining a long illne&s;s, cau&s;ed and continued by tho&s;e fond and
importunate whi&s;perings which would fain have &s;timulated him to clear
him&s;elf, and reap the glory of obtaining his wi&s;hes by the defeat of his
rival, after at length congratulating him&s;elf upon the full e&s;tabli&s;hment
of his health, and in that his &s;taunch determination to abide by what he had
re&s;olved, to fall into the mo&s;t effectual means of opening a wound that had
been all but mortal, and, at this time only cicatrized, was a trial one would
think, under which his whole re&s;olution mu&s;t for|&s;ake him. It would
certainly be a trait of perfect nature if the reader found him the next morning
familiarly at breakfa&s;t with Sir Sidney and his fa|mily. The very rever&s;e
however happened, which I &s;hall contend is fairly as natural, upon the
prin|ciple of two ve&s;&s;els, which &s;tanding upon different tacks, may yet
meet each other with the &s;ame wind. In &s;hort, had his down been points of
needles, he could not have &s;hifted, twined, and turned him&s;elf 
<PB N="7" REF="5"> about with greater pain, nor at every new po&s;ition have
met with a more novel torment.</P>
<P>The charms of Annette, coupled with the morti|fying difficulties
which &s;tood between him and his hopes, wounded him on one &s;ide in a
thou&s;and places, which &s;hifting to avoid the &s;aucy familiarity of
Glo&s;s, and the humility into which he was thrown by Sir Sidney's injurious
&s;u&s;picions and ill judged pride, gave it him home.</P>
<P>He &s;aw, he felt, he found him&s;elf conquered by Annette. Her
lovely, mode&s;t, &s;peaking, &s;oul-di&s;|&s;olving perfections &s;tood
confe&s;&s;ed, and he found him&s;elf their certain, evident, unequivocal
victim: but was this to overcome &s;o rea&s;onable a &s;y&s;tem of independant
integrity?&mdash;to throw down a &s;tructure of hone&s;t, hopeful tranquillity,
which it had taken him &s;o much time and pains to rear?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, to&s;&s;ed about between &s;uch violent and
contending pa&s;&s;ions, he raved, &s;ighed, &s;wore, wept, execrated his fate,
and ble&s;&s;ed his &s;tars, till at length, his valet interrupting him with an
account that the hor&s;es were ready, he collected him&s;elf, ro&s;e, mounted,
and rode away before any per&s;on got up who could po&s;&s;ibly &s;tagger his
now inviolable re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6"> He made for Paris with every po&s;&s;ible
expedition, where he endeavoured to lo&s;e, in that &s;tream of plea&s;ure,
tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;table bars to his happine&s;s which, &s;pight of all his
re&s;olution, pre&s;ented them|&s;elves: &s;o very difficult is it; in &s;ome
ca&s;es, for rea|&s;on to e&s;tabli&s;h tranquillity.</P>
<P>After a month's &s;tay at Paris, he returned to his native
country, where he will now be &s;een in the character of an independant young
man, without a &s;ingle friend or advi&s;er.</P>
<P>Here it will not be ami&s;s to recount that &s;trange train of
accidents which brought about &s;o extraor|dinary a meeting between Sir Sidney
and our hero at Aix la Chapelle.</P>
<P>Emma, &s;ince &s;he found it in vain to tamper with Charles,
determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to get at &s;ome in|telligence of him through
Figgins, who, contrary to her expectation&mdash;for &s;he thought it a forlorn
hope, as we may &s;ee by her la&s;t letter&mdash;not only informed her of his
motions, but corroborated his informa|tion, by &s;hewing her &s;ome
pa&s;&s;ages in his letters.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Emma heard of our hero's &s;ick|ne&s;s, and
danger of being taken off by a lingering con&s;umption, than, mad as it may
appear, &s;he de|termined <PB N="9" REF="7"> to carry the whole family to be
witne&s;s to their handy work. This was certainly a trait worthy of her
&s;agacity. She anticipated her &s;uc|ce&s;s; and, enjoying her imaginary
triumph, pictured to her&s;elf the dying lover revived by the gentle and tender
attention of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and entreated to life and happine&s;s by the
returning indulgence of her relenting father.</P>
<P>The only difficulty was how to bring it about; but even this was
no impediment to the genius of Emma. She revived the &s;ubject of Annette's
mo|ther, which, &s;ince the information from Mr. In|got, had only been darkly
&s;poken of through the medium of epi&s;tolary enquiry. Sir Sidney had, at
times, talked of a trip to the &s;outh of France, and Emma pre&s;&s;ed Lady
Roebuck very hard to keep him to his intention: for which &s;he offered many
notable rea&s;ons. It would wear off the chagrin that had been cau&s;ed by
&s;uch an alteration in the family hopes; it would enlarge the ideas of
Annette, and if any lurking wi&s;h remained behind in favour of Charles, by
employing her mind on new objects, it would di&s;po&s;e her to receive with
more alacrity the &s;olicitations of Mr. Glo&s;s&mdash;for every body but
her&s;elf &s;uppo&s;ed Charles to be in Italy&mdash;whom, Emma was of opinion,
they ought to take with them, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8"> In &s;hort, this plotting jade had fairly
formed a pretty fea&s;ible plan of fini&s;hing this hi&s;tory, about the very
time when, and near the very place where, I, who knew better things, thought
proper to throw it into a new perplexity.</P>
<P>With very little importunity, Sir Sidney con|&s;ented to give
the ladies this jaunt. They took the route through part of Artois, to Rhiems,
and pa&s;&s;ed through Chalons to Dijon, near which city had lived the Count de
Gramont, who was an old intimate of Sir Sidney, and through who&s;e intere&s;t
he now meant to make his enquiries. At this hou&s;e they called, and, to the
great &s;urpri&s;e and &s;orrow of the baronet, he found that the old count
had, four years before, paid the debt of nature, and that his only &s;on, whom
Sir Sidney knew when a child, enjoyed now his title and his fortunes.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney was ho&s;pitably welcomed by the young count, who
beguiled away a week of their time very agreeably. The family then prepared to
continue their journey. No mention however would have been made of their
intended enquiries, had not the young count previou&s;ly, and luckily too,
formed a de&s;ign at this time to vi&s;it Province where he in|&s;i&s;ted upon
making his father's friend welcome at a &s;mall e&s;tate in that quarter. The
fact is, he had <PB N="11" REF="9"> fallen violently in love with Annette, and
nothing could have kept him from &s;oliciting her hand from her father but the
evident certainty that Glo&s;s was intended to be the happy man. Standing
pretty well however in his own opinion, and being a man of family and fortune,
he had but little difficulty to per&s;uade him&s;elf he &s;hould &s;oon
out&s;hine his rival, if he could contrive to be of their party a little
lon|ger. Growing, however, more and more enamoured every hour, and not being
able to &s;tay till they ar|rived at their journey's end, he had, on that very
day the reader and I were witne&s;&s;es to his di&s;grace at Aix la Chapelle,
&s;u&s;tained a hand&s;ome, though po&s;itive, refu&s;al from Annette, and
another from her father. Raging with di&s;appointment, he flew to wine for
relief. This fired him ten times more, when coming to the inn, to bury his
intoxication and his wretchedne&s;s in &s;leep, he was &s;topt by his <HI>valet
de chambre,</HI> who, being the factotum of his amours, promi&s;ed him the
accompli&s;hment of that which he never before had the temerity to think of,
much le&s;s hope for. In &s;hort, after telling him a hundred lies, to inflame
him, he had the addre&s;s, by the help of the chamber-maid of the inn, to place
him in a clo&s;et in the chamber where Annette was to &s;leep. He &s;aw her
enter with Emma, who having &s;et down the candle, began to look over &s;ome
linen and other things for Lady Roebuck.&mdash;As <PB N="12" REF="10"> they
laid acro&s;s her arm, 
<Q REND="inline">'Well really,' &s;aid &s;he, 'there is no
knowing what to wear in this &s;ame France; it is the &s;trange&s;t, motley
place&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' &s;aid Annette, 'there is a great deal to
gratify one's curio&s;ity. The thing I like lea&s;t in it is this trouble&s;ome
count. If he and Mr. Glo&s;s were where my poor Charles is, and he in their
place, France would be a paradi&s;e to me.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' &s;aid Emma, 'do not
de&s;pair.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'De&s;pair,' an&s;wered Annette, 'why &s;hould I
hope? Were he here, did he love me&mdash;and that I am afraid Emma he does not,
be where he will&mdash;what would it avail me, de&s;igned as I am by the will
of the be&s;t, though, in this ca&s;e, the cruele&s;t, father for
another?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Don't be unea&s;y about that,' &s;aid Emma, 'I
have a &s;ecret to cure your father and all the world of &s;uch a folly as that
would be. In &s;hort I am much more plea&s;ed that Mr. Glo&s;s &s;hould be
in|tended for your hu&s;band than any man in the world, &s;ince it mu&s;t not
be Mr. Hazard. I cannot &s;ay &s;o much for the count, for he has a thou&s;and
advantages over the other, and if Sir Sidney were not &s;o attached to his
parliamentary friend, we &s;hould find our&s;elves a good deal embarra&s;&s;ed
to <PB N="13" REF="11"> get rid of the other. A painter&mdash;and it is the
&s;ame with an author, for words are figurative co|lours&mdash;can put that
object in &s;hadow which is a di&s;grace to the groupe, but he would be blamed
for doing this by one that ornaments it. But come, my &s;weet lady, I hope you
are nearer hap|pine&s;s than you think for. One thing is&mdash;but you mu&s;t
not betray it for your life&mdash;that Charles is not in Italy, and I hope it
will not be long be|fore you &s;ee him!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not in Italy!' cried Annette, 'not long be|fore
I &s;ee him! Do, my dear, my kind Emma, explain your&s;elf.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'My lady waits for the&s;e things,' &s;aid Emma;
'I will tell you more when I return; till then be as happy in idea as the
plea&s;ing picture I have drawn can make you.</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he retired,
with a view of going to Lady Roebuck.</P>
<P>Seeing there was no time to be lo&s;t, the count, the moment
this conver&s;ation was over, which he had li&s;tened to, but under&s;tood not
a word of, came out of his hiding place, and &s;urpri&s;ing An|nette at the
door, locked it, and began, as we have &s;een, to be pretty free with her. He
was however &s;o awed by her beauty, that he had very little &s;hocked her
delicacy when &s;he was relieved by our hero, <PB N="14" REF="12"> whom &s;he
no &s;ooner &s;aw, alarmed and confu&s;ed as &s;he was, than &s;he could not
help fancying&mdash;the fore|going conver&s;ation being &s;trongly in her
mind&mdash;that the whole was one of Emma's romantic &s;chemes. This, when they
retired to re&s;t, &s;he &s;crupled not to confe&s;s to Emma, laying before her
very &s;trongly all the con&s;equences of any premature de&s;ign to de|ceive
her father, which &s;he was &s;ure, if he di&s;co|vered, he would never
forgive, and which could not fail, in&s;tead of mending their affairs, to leave
them in a wor&s;e condition than ever. She thanked her with warmth, with
tenderne&s;s, with tears, for the attention &s;he paid to her wi&s;hes;
declared that no one ever had a truer friend, but it was plain for|tune
determined to per&s;ecute her, and therefore all her kindne&s;s would be
u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Emma was very much touched at Annette's good opinion of her, and
thanked her for it in terms of &s;incere acknowledgment. She lamented with her
the great probability that indeed there was of her fu&s;taining more
per&s;ecutions, but &s;he &s;aid it was the lot of virtue to be e&s;&s;ayed,
but that, thanks to heaven, to tho&s;e trials it owed its purity.</P>
<P>She &s;aid &s;he knew well the implacability of Charles's
temper, which &s;he was convinced would not relax a tittle; but this, in &s;ome
degree, &s;he <PB N="15" REF="13"> could not di&s;approve; for he had been very
ill treated.</P>
<P>Our hero's conduct indeed was, in Emma's opi|nion, the noble&s;t
&s;he had ever heard of; but then &s;he knew to what it was attributable. To
&s;ay the truth, &s;he knew much more than the reader imagines; or perhaps
knows him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Emma acknowledged that &s;he knew of his being in the &s;outh of
France, but that his coming there that afternoon was purely accidental: at
lea&s;t &s;he knew nothing to the contrary: for that &s;he had not expected to
&s;ee him till they came to Montpelier, where he had been for many months at
the point of death, though it was plain he was now not only hap|pily recovered,
but much hand&s;omer than ever.</P>
<P>Night alone beheld tho&s;e blu&s;hes which &s;uffu&s;ed
Annette's cheeks at the&s;e words. They were ex|cited by a flattering hope, but
were as in&s;tantly di&s;|&s;ipated by intruding fear, which changed the
car|nation to a pallid hue, and &s;tarted two pearly tears, that trickling from
her beautiful eyes, lo&s;t them|&s;elves upon her pillow.</P>
<P>Emma &s;aid that though Charles mu&s;t now &s;tand much higher
in every body's mind than he had lately <PB N="16" REF="14"> done, yet it was
plain Sir Sidney had felt him&s;elf treated with indignity, which would
operate, in conjunction with the in&s;iduous arts of Glo&s;s, to Charles's
great di&s;advantage. They would &s;ee how|ever the re&s;ult of matters in the
morning. In the mean time, &s;he was glad the count's hopes were at an end; for
as to Glo&s;s, &s;he begged her lovely young lady to make her&s;elf perfectly
ea&s;y, for as he never could be her hu&s;band, which &s;he would her&s;elf
take good care of, rather good than harm would come of his hovering about her;
for though a trouble&s;ome in&s;ect him&s;elf, he would &s;erve to keep off
others who were more &s;o. She &s;aid &s;he held it good doctrine to u&s;e evil
agents to come at truth, and maintained that HOBBES is right where he &s;ays 
<Q REND="inline">'that it is law|ful to make u&s;e of ill
in&s;truments to do our&s;elves good;' and adds, 'If I were ca&s;t into a deep
pit, and the devil was to put down his cloven foot, I would take hold of it to
be drawn out.'</Q></P>
<P>The great object of Annette's concern was le&s;t Charles did not
love her; which doubt Emma un|dertook to di&s;&s;ipate. She &s;aid it was
impo&s;&s;ible; he was the be&s;t and mo&s;t charming young man upon earth, as
was &s;he the mo&s;t virtuous and lovely young lady; that &s;he was as &s;ure
they were born for each other, as if &s;he read their hi&s;tory in the book of 
<PB N="17" REF="15"> fate; but that troubles, and many yet, they cer|tainly
were born to encounter.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' &s;aid &s;he, 'my dear Mi&s;s
An|nette, you are very well off: our whole affairs are a novel, I confe&s;s,
but yours are not the di&s;tre&s;&s;es in which young ladies &s;o &s;ituated
generally find them&s;elves. Your father is not hard and boi&s;ter|ous, like
We&s;tern; nor is Glo&s;s bewitching and &s;educing, like Lovelace. I can
da&s;h his hopes in a moment, whenever I plea&s;e. Comfort your|&s;elf then, my
dear lady: you have in me a firm, and, though not very old, yet I will venture
to &s;ay an experienced friend; and I &s;hall as &s;urely pilot the ve&s;&s;el
into port, as that I am now con|ducting it with &s;kill and fore&s;ight, in
&s;pight of all the adver&s;e winds and beating waves that &s;urround
it.'</Q></P>
<P>Emma was now in her element. She &s;oothed An|nette with every
kind and friendly argument her in|vention&mdash;which was pretty
fertile&mdash;could &s;upply. She in&s;tanced all the &s;imilar &s;ituations
&s;he had read of, and proved to a demon&s;tration that happine&s;s was as
certainly the ultimatum of Annette's fortune, as that the interval would be
filled with many trials of her virtue, her temper, and her fortitude.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"> Upon the whole, Mrs. Emma determined never
again to give a hint of what &s;he had in agitation to Annette. Young and timid
as &s;he was, who knew how far her prudence would be a &s;ecurity for her not
betraying it. She plainly &s;aw that though Charles could not be robbed of the
palm he had &s;o hand&s;omely earned, yet, as Sir Sidney had expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf in terms of great warmth, after our hero had left the room, this was
not the moment to pre&s;s her pre&s;ent de&s;ign.</P>
<P>After a variety of deliberations with her&s;elf, while Annette
&s;lept, &s;he determined to &s;ee Charles early in the morning, and advi&s;e
him to follow their &s;teps, till &s;he &s;hould give him a fit opportunity of
declaring him&s;elf; and in order to induce him to this, &s;he would lay him
down the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons in her power, without trenching ab&s;olutely
upon &s;ome &s;ecrets which &s;he meant to make u&s;e of as a <HI>denier
re&s;ort,</HI> le&s;t he, from rage, &s;hould make as bad an u&s;e of them, as
Annette would from &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Having well dige&s;ted this plan, &s;he commended her&s;elf to
the arms of &s;leep, where &s;he continued locked &s;o long, that when &s;he
came to enquire in the morning for our hero, he was &s;ome miles on his way to
Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17"> I &s;hall now recur to the &s;cene of
action, out of which Mr. Charles was &s;een ju&s;t now to &s;talk with &s;uch
con&s;cious dignity.</P>
<P>When Sir Sidney and the re&s;t fir&s;t came into the chamber,
they really did not know what to think of the matter, it was &s;o &s;udden and
unexpected; but as &s;oon as they heard the Frenchman's hand&s;ome accu&s;ation
of him&s;elf, and found it impo&s;&s;ible that our hero could be any other than
the champion of the lady, they really had the con&s;cience to give him credit
for one worthy action; and, as truth has the knack of di&s;per&s;ing
fal&s;ehood in more ways than one, it all of a &s;udden &s;truck Sir Sidney,
that Charles mu&s;t either be &s;trangely altered, or that report had not in
all ca&s;es done him ju&s;tice; for that it was impo&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t
very unlikely, that any man &s;hould hold &s;uch a contrary di&s;po&s;ition, as
to be a devil to-day, and an angel to-morrow.</P>
<P>The&s;e were Sir Sidney's reflections. Lady Roe|buck's were
&s;till kinder. Emma's were admira|tion, and Annette's tender, delicate, lively
grati|tude; and, feeling thus, they really made a very pretty group for a
picture.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the chimney piece &s;tood the mu&s;ing 
<PB N="20" REF="18"> baronet, with his hand to his forehead. His beau|tiful
daughter, who had accidentally fallen into an arm chair, held al&s;o her hand
to her face, which however did not conceal her tears of indignation for her
ravi&s;her, or tho&s;e burning blu&s;hes full of love and thanks to her
deliverer.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, though in a&s;toni&s;hment too, by turns eyed her
hu&s;band, Annette, and Charles, with regards plainly intimating her perturbed
and anxious &s;en&s;ations; while Emma, firm and collected, &s;earched every
eye, and would fain have pervaded every heart, to furni&s;h her&s;elf with
arguments for that ma&s;ter-&s;troke &s;he was now meditating.</P>
<P>Our hero, as I have already de&s;cribed, was tran&s;|fixed like
a &s;tatue; but it was rather like an inani|mate body, who&s;e &s;oul had left
it, and fled to that heaven on which the eyes &s;eemed to bend with re|luctant
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As to the count, he had his head again&s;t the wall, without
daring to look any one in the face.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this critical moment every thing &s;eemed to depend
upon the fir&s;t word that &s;hould be <PB N="21" REF="19"> &s;poken, which
unfortunately coming from the mouth of Mr. Glo&s;s, our hero's love gave place,
or rather &s;pur, to his re&s;entment, and &s;o threw him off his guard as to
occa&s;ion that di&s;re&s;pect which he &s;hewed to Sir Sidney, and his abrupt
departure after|wards.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney never felt &s;o &s;en&s;ible a mortification in his
life. He was plainly upon the point of mak|ing &s;uch advances to Charles as
very likely would have led to a complete reconciliation. He had balanced, as we
have &s;een, as to his de&s;erts, from the fir&s;t moment he felt that warm
&s;en&s;ation of ge|nerous gratitude for his daughter's protection.</P>
<P>This prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour, his per&s;on, which
called to mind a thou&s;and partial ideas, did not a little contribute to
&s;trengthen. How then mu&s;t this fair pro&s;pect of engendering good-will be
un|timely de&s;troyed, when &s;uch a blight as our hero's terms of rebuke were
held out to one who expected &s;olicitation in&s;tead of defiance! His kind
thoughts immediately receded, and re&s;entment filled their place; but,
however, with &s;o very little foundation, that he was obliged to &s;earch for

ex|planation from the count of his conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"> The count charged it very properly upon the
ra&s;|cality of his &s;ervant, whom he in&s;tantly called up, paid his wages,
and kicked out of the room: an example, were it more imitated, would &s;ave the
honour of many young gentlemen of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The count then &s;aid his crime could not be pal|liated,
otherwi&s;e he would never &s;tir from An|nett's feet till he had implored her
pardon, nor from Sir Sidney's pre&s;ence till he had con&s;ented &s;he &s;hould
be his. As it was, he would hide his di&s;|grace in ab&s;ence, and never again
pre&s;ume to ap|pear before a family whom he had treated&mdash;in&s;tead of the
re&s;pect due to &s;trangers&mdash;with the ill manners and villany of a
ruffian.</P>
<P>He further &s;aid, he &s;hould love the young gentle|man as long
as he lived who had prevented his de|&s;ign, and, were not his influence all
gone, he &s;hould &s;trongly recommend him to Sir Sidney's friend&s;hip and
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he took his leave, went to an|other inn, and
the next morning left the town, about an hour after our hero.</P>
<P>A conduct &s;o collected and uniform in one mo|ment 
<PB N="23" REF="21"> engendered a new plot in the imagination of Mr. Glo&s;s. 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Sir Sidney,' &s;aid he, 'this is the

it?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon my word I do not even know what you mean,'
an&s;wered the baronet.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, my dear &s;ir, nothing can be

Italy, but lurking about till you &s;hould come to France. For this was Mi&s;s

<P>Sir Sidney could not admit the entire force of this charge,

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF JOURNEYING AND CASTLE-BUILDING.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN it was known the next morning that both our hero and the
count had left Aix la Chapelle, Sir Sidney, kept up to his belief by Mr.
Glo&s;s, began in reality to think that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the night
before was a concerted matter between tho&s;e two gentlemen. It wore &s;o much
the com|plexion of tho&s;e tricks he had heard of before, and was in every
re&s;pect &s;o like what he had been taught to think of the genius of our hero,
that it &s;carcely admitted of a doubt. But, were this the ca&s;e, what did it
infer? Why, truly, becau&s;e all his friends would not believe him innocent of
pranks that had been &s;o &s;ub&s;tantiated, he mu&s;t meditate an injury that
ought never to be forgiven. Did not his haughty &s;peech at parting confirm it?
For even &s;up|po&s;e that he had no motive for what he did but common
ju&s;tice, nobody would in &s;o di&s;dainful a manner refu&s;ed to be thanked.
No, the matter <PB N="26" REF="24"> was apparently very plain, and if really
what it ap|peared, it only proved that he whom they had hopes of a penitent,
had now given proof that he was incorrigible. But were it allowed to be
po&s;&s;i|ble&mdash;which there was very little ground for&mdash;that all this
&s;trange bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould have been the mere effect of chance, was it,
even in that ca&s;e, a proper thing to lie at the caprice and whim of an
ab&s;urd young man? Was it through pride and di&s;dain he meant to aim at
conciliation? Did he expect to be begged and entreated to forgive? Had he &s;o
far forgot all the duties re&s;ulting from tho&s;e motives which alone could
worthily have excited &s;uch con|duct as to think it ought to erect him into
pride and haughtine&s;s? And, la&s;tly, had he the vanity to &s;uppo&s;e that
having left the town, be the motive what it might, any body would take the
trouble to &s;end after him?</P>
<P>Weighing all the&s;e con&s;iderations, Sir Sidney was determined
to repay pride with pride, and though, if it ever came to his knowledge as a
po&s;itive cer|tainty that Charles had acted in this bu&s;ine&s;s
di&s;in|tere&s;tedly, he &s;hould conceive him&s;elf under an obligation, he
&s;hould neverthele&s;s look upon it as one of that &s;ort which a vain
&s;upercilious conduct had completely cancelled.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25"> Thus was the baronet at lea&s;t as firmly
&s;et again&s;t our hero as ever he could be again&s;t the baronet, and fully
confirmed in the&s;e &s;entiments, which Glo&s;s failed not to extol.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, Annette, and even Emma, though not obliged to
acquie&s;ce, were at lea&s;t prohibited from making objections.</P>
<P>To bring them to England as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, where I am
impatient to attend our hero, it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a few
words.</P>
<P>They kept on their way for Province, where Sir Sidney found
every thing very much altered. The former abbe&s;s of the convent where
Annette's mo|ther was &s;uppo&s;ed to have died, had been replaced &s;ome
years, and her &s;ucce&s;&s;or could give no more account of the matter than
that &s;he under&s;tood Mi&s;s Le Clerc had gone to England, with
permi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome years before. In &s;hort, &s;he told Ingot's &s;tory,
with the addition of her having returned, &s;ettled her affairs, made
intere&s;t to be of a new order, more &s;uitable to her circum&s;tances, to a
certain convent of which order &s;he had retired at a di&s;tant town, where it
was &s;aid they might hear further tidings of her.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26"> Sir Sidney, finding Lady Roebuck and Emma
very anxious to get at the bottom of this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;for as to Annette,
&s;he was always taugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to believe
that her mother was dead&mdash;indulged t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eir curio&s;ity, though this &s;ame town was out of their road to
Pa|ris. The &s;cent however was &s;oon lo&s;t, for Mi&s;s Le Clerc had
&s;hifted her place of re&s;idence one more, and they either could not or would
not give the &s;malle&s;t information weere &s;he was gone: they therefore got
away expeditiou&s;ly to Paris, at which city they arrived a few days after our
hero had left it, and after pa&s;&s;ing away about five weeks very
plea&s;antly, returned in &s;afety to their own coun|try.</P>
<P>Charles, in his way to Paris, to drive Annette from his
thoughts, began to con&s;ider in earne&s;t what he &s;hould do in the world. He
was young, had a tolerable right to think well of his abilities, and would very
&s;hortly touch a large &s;um of money.&mdash;He had all his life employed his
time indu&s;triou&s;ly, and thought he &s;hould now wrong his country and
him&s;elf if he let his talents ru&s;t in indolence.</P>
<P>The &s;ublime&s;t wi&s;h of his heart was to patroni&s;e merit.
He &s;hould not however, he feared, find him|&s;elf rich enough. He mu&s;t oke
out his fortune then. To effect this, he hit upon fifty &s;chemes, 
<PB N="29" REF="27"> but was not able to pitch on any thing he thought likely
to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, till he met with an Engli&s;h nobleman in Paris, who
initiated him in the my&s;tery of preferment, and plainly &s;hewed him all its
devious and intricate paths.</P>
<P>Charles contemplated this road to fortune with eager plea&s;ure.
His booby brother was a lord; his &s;upercilious rival a member of parliament
and a po|pular &s;peaker: &s;hould he then live a mere ob&s;cure private
gentleman!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he bargained with the peer for a bo|rough. The peer,
on their arrival in England, made the broom&s;tick, who was then member,
va|cate his &s;eat, by an acceptance of the Chiltern hun|dreds, and, at the
expence of &s;omething more than eight thou&s;and pounds, our hero found
him&s;elf a member of the third branch of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>My lord, by convention, was to follow up Charles's initiation
with his patronage, which had only the trifling condition annexed to it of
always voting with the mini&s;ter. A fortnight however did not pa&s;s before
the impo&s;&s;ibility of this was made &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>He had con&s;ented to the purcha&s;e of a borough, 
<PB N="30" REF="28"> becau&s;e he had been told that &s;uch things are as
openly &s;old as &s;hoes and &s;tockings, or any other article that a man
chu&s;es to appropriate to him&s;elf, upon paying its full value, or perhaps a
little more, but to &s;upport that it was noon-day at mid-night&mdash;or indeed
any of tho&s;e many po&s;itions he was almo&s;t ordered to &s;econd&mdash;to
hold forth for three hours to the great detriment of his lungs, and, what is
wor&s;e, of his varacity, with a view, like legerdemain, of &s;hewing a
que&s;tion in every po&s;&s;ible point of view but the right, and then
&s;anction this outrage on truth, this fraud on his own con&s;cience, by voting
that it might be carried into a law, and &s;o be ac|ce&s;&s;ary to the
multiplying of the&s;e outrages and the&s;e frauds to the detriment of his
fellow citizens!&mdash;this was a condition he could not prevail on him&s;elf
to fulfil, and therefore&mdash;at which he wondered, with|out cau&s;e&mdash;the
parliament being di&s;&s;olved in about five months after he took his &s;eat,
our hero's bo|rough, notwith&s;tanding a fre&s;h three thou&s;and pounds which
he laid out in conte&s;tation&mdash;though how it &s;hould be &s;pent is
a&s;toni&s;hing, for the place had not above thirteen hou&s;es&mdash;received
its former member, Mr. Stopgap, who, as complai&s;antly as before, in le&s;s
than a twelve-month took again the Chiltern hundreds, that the borough might be
pur|cha&s;ed by a new bubble, who however bought it with better &s;ucce&s;s
than our hero, for, by always <PB N="31" REF="29"> &s;aying aye, he &s;oon got
a pen&s;ion well worth the money he had paid for it.</P>
<P>By the way, Charles's conduct in parliament was the mo&s;t
curious thing in nature. Having no bias but truth, his opinions &s;eemed to
wear a very motley and &s;trange appearance, to tho&s;e who were hack|neyed in
the way of debate; but indeed he was, as Kiddy would call it, up with them; for
even tho&s;e who argued on the &s;ame &s;ide, by having imbibed a pa&s;&s;ion
for rhetoric, a quaintne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, a vein of drollery, or &s;ome
other quality of embelli&s;h|ing and flattering truth out of the very form they
ought to wi&s;h it &s;hould wear, appeared to him the mo&s;t unhandy handlers
of an argument that could be conceived. In &s;hort, he was an innovator, and
nobody was &s;orry to lo&s;e him; for, &s;aid they, a man who votes &s;ometimes
on one &s;ide, and &s;ome|times on the other, can be of no party, and
there|fore ought not to be a member of the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney, it is true, as an independant country gentleman,
voted with his con&s;cience, but yet this was generally on one &s;ide; for, by
prejudice of education, he was pretty well fixed as to his &s;enti|ments
concerning the government of this country. In &s;hort, every thing that
promoted the ble&s;&s;ing of <PB N="32" REF="30"> peace, he &s;upported; every
thing that led to the de&s;olation of war he di&s;countenanced.</P>
<P>By the way, Sir Sidney and our hero con&s;idered one another as
perfect &s;trangers during the whole time they &s;at together as members.</P>
<P>Charles, when he returned to England, received of Mr. Balance
the gro&s;s &s;um of twenty-nine thou|&s;and pounds. His borough and his
private ex|pences had, in &s;even months, &s;unk this &s;um to nearly half.
This nettled him not a little. To &s;et out with the laudable intention
certainly of exalting him&s;elf, but with the pure&s;t motives of public
in|tegrity, and &s;u&s;tain in &s;o &s;hort a time &s;o much
di&s;|grace!&mdash;it was not to be borne. He had given proof, on many private
occa&s;ions, that he could wield a pen; he was determined to try whether he
could not do it, and to effect, on a public one.</P>
<P> He lo&s;t no time, but immediately brought out a pamphlet which
he called "Parliamentary Con&s;i&s;|tency." It was pithy, &s;en&s;ible, and
&s;evere, and laid bare all the manoeuvres of making and garbling acts of
parliament; &s;hewing that as chicanery was engendered with law, no wonder if
it grew up with it.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31"> Nothing however was gratified in this
bu&s;ine&s;s but revenge. A few &s;en&s;ible people found a great deal of merit
in the publication; the book&s;ellers declared that the young man touched in
pretty, &s;mart, round periods enough, and that when his for|tune &s;hould be
&s;pent, they would be glad to employ him at <HI>per &s;heet.</HI></P>
<P>The active mind of our hero would not let him &s;it down quietly
under &s;o heavy a reduction of his fortune. He thought every hour an age till
he &s;hould be engaged in &s;omething to redeem his lo&s;s. Had he remained in
parliament for any length of time, he had no &s;ort of doubt but he &s;hould
have completed all his wi&s;hes, without the interference of the
mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>He had, with great accuracy, noticed where the laws were
deficient in relieving the poor and op|pre&s;&s;ed, and indeed all
de&s;criptions of mankind in helple&s;s &s;ituations. He had expected, upon
point|ing out amendments in the&s;e laws&mdash;which he con|ceived could
ea&s;ily be done&mdash;he &s;hould erect him|&s;elf into &s;uch popularity,
that he could command a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that &s;tate to which he &s;hould
thus have been &s;o u&s;eful.</P>
<P>As it was, he had made but little progre&s;s in 
<PB N="34" REF="32"> this de&s;irable pur&s;uit; neverthele&s;s, what he had
done was a beginning, and it actually had rai&s;ed an alarm among
fore&s;tallers, engraters, and other ene|mies to the lower part of the
community.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o a plan of inducing a parliamentary attention to
the liberal arts, and he meant, as a preliminary &s;tep, to try at a regulation
of public amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Many other benevolent ideas occupied his thoughts, tending both
to public accommodation and private convenience; but the &s;cheme that mo&s;t
delighted him was one by means of which he had flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould
be able to curtail the privileges of lawyers, who&s;e emoluments drained from
the nece&s;&s;itous, he proved by computation, amounted to a third more upon
any twenty given cau&s;es, than the damages given in tho&s;e cau&s;es by the
jury; and were the aggregate account of ex|pences and damages come at for
&s;even, or &s;eventeen, nay or &s;eventy years, he had rea&s;on to think the
proportion would be ju&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This clearly proved that a man, with ever &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e,
had better put up with a fir&s;t lo&s;s, let it be what it might, than &s;eek
the only redre&s;s the laws <PB N="35" REF="33"> of his country had permitted
him to have recour&s;e to. Yet no &s;tep had been taken to cure this evil.</P>
<P>His catalogue of &s;uch abu&s;es as came under the cognizance of
the courts was immen&s;e. Tho&s;e abu&s;es of which the courts had not the
&s;malle&s;t idea were a &s;till larger li&s;t, and proved that the &s;ole mode
the legi&s;lature had provided to decide tho&s;e two grand articles by which
all the ties of good-fellow|&s;hip are cemented, by which ranks are
di&s;tingui&s;hed, property a&s;certained and &s;ecured&mdash;In &s;hort, right
and wrong;&mdash;in&s;tead of holding out &s;ecurity, and being a ble&s;&s;ing,
was a cur&s;e, in a land of freedom, that the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive tyranny had
never equalled in any country.</P>
<P>This la&s;t enumeration of abu&s;es, he &s;aid, was the mo&s;t
grievous thing that could be conceived to peo|ple of middling life. The&s;e
abu&s;es con&s;i&s;ted of pro|ce&s;&s;es that went no farther than arre&s;ts
and accom|modations, in which the attornies, though adver&s;e
profe&s;&s;ionally, were privately intimate friends.&mdash;The&s;e erected
them&s;elves into judge and jury, and the re&s;ult was nine times out of ten
that the defen|dant, to avoid impri&s;onment, was forced into terms
impo&s;&s;ible to be complied with.</P>
<P>Could any provi&s;ion take in all it was meant to 
<PB N="36" REF="34"> comprehend which failed of effect in any particular? The
laws of England did in a very e&s;&s;ential parti|cular: they precluded the
poor from any benefit from them, while the rich could u&s;e them to op|pre&s;s
that very poor for who&s;e defence&mdash;if by law is meant human
&s;ecurity&mdash;benevolent rea&s;on &s;ays they ought in an e&s;pecial manner
to provide.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'How can this be?' &s;ays the lawyer; 'the poor
may &s;ue in <HI>forma pauperis.</HI>'</Q> What do they gain by this? Why truly
they are allowed the &s;tamps, but who will allow them an attorney that will
manage their affairs for a &s;ingle farthing le&s;s than his full
fees?&mdash;which always include three-fourths of his bill.</P>
<P>The&s;e, as I have &s;aid, were &s;ome among the many
re&s;ources from which Charles hoped to draw much public benefit; nor did he,
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e &s;ubjects, appear to
have a &s;uperficial judgment, for he had &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s of manners, and
was &s;o void of any pride, except that which re&s;ults from con&s;cious
in|tegrity, that he did not di&s;dain to &s;earch for infor|mation among
tho&s;e where alone he could demon|&s;trably find it.</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, in conjunction with a few other 
<PB N="37" REF="35"> worthy members of parliament, he bent his time to a full
con&s;ideration of ca&s;es, entirely among the poorer part of the community;
and it was not rare to &s;ee him at work-hou&s;es and pri&s;ons, where his
pur&s;e &s;ecretly following his generous heart, bellow|ed on him as much
&s;atisfaction, by relieving a widow or an orphan, as &s;ome men&mdash;his
brother perhaps for one&mdash;would have received in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a
tenant, or &s;educing his daughter.</P>
<P>Finding however all his hopes no more than a dream&mdash;from
which he had been &s;o di&s;agreeably awoke&mdash;he had now no ability but to
pity tho&s;e whom he could no longer a&s;&s;i&s;t!</P>
<P>He might, to be &s;ure, have purcha&s;ed another borough, but he
now &s;aw the fallacy of &s;uch traf|fic, and well knew that if he could
en&s;ure a feat as long as he &s;hould live, it would be utterly
im|po&s;&s;ible for him to carry any one point, till he had previou&s;ly &s;old
his opinion, and then what would he be but the echo of another man's will,
without having a will of his own.</P>
<P>Determined however to do all he could&mdash;&s;lender as his
means were&mdash;he concerted &s;everal fea&s;ible plans, by which, while he
rea&s;onably improved <PB N="38" REF="36"> his money, he fancied he &s;hould
procure a mo&s;t de&s;irable relief to many who &s;tood in need of &s;uch

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE RATIFICATION OF ONE TREATY, AND THE INFRACTION OF
ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE Charles is dige&s;ting his liberal plans&mdash;that I may
keep this hi&s;tory compact, and all its characters within view&mdash;I &s;hall
recur a little to &s;uch per&s;ons and things as may enable me &s;o to do.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I do not wi&s;h the reader &s;hould fancy
that I made Charles all of a &s;udden &s;o vio|lently in love with Annette, at
Aix la Chapelle, for no better purpo&s;e than merely to put him into a mad
freak or two, and there an end. It is true, he &s;wore a great many bitter
oaths that he would &s;ooner tear his tongue from his mouth, and his heart from
his bo&s;om, than &s;uffer one to &s;peak or the other to dictate a &s;ingle
&s;yllable that could betray the folly of loving one who&s;e family
unde&s;ervedly de&s;pi&s;ed him. But does not the reader know that this was
rather what he uttered, than what it was in his power to put in practice. Was
he not a lover? <PB N="40" REF="38"> Did not the po&s;itive confirmation of
that fact take its date from the bu&s;ine&s;s of Aix la Chapelle? And could any
thing he afterwards &s;aid or thought be con&s;idered in any other light than
as the declara|tion of a maniac, who, in the mid&s;t of a paroxi&s;m, tells you
he is in his right &s;en&s;es? The injunction he laid upon his tongue was well
enough, and I que&s;tion whether the threatened mutilation, or &s;ome|thing
like it, might not have followed its infringe|ment. But as to his heart! Lord
help the poor man! It was about as much in his power to direct that, as it
would be for a mi&s;er to prevail upon him|&s;elf to give a poor wretch a
guinea whom he &s;aw expiring for want.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we &s;ee him prancing about from one wretched object
to another, and per&s;uading, amu&s;|ing, intere&s;ting, wheedling, and coaxing
this &s;ame heart into all the amu&s;ements for which &s;uch kind of men
directors are worthily formed; and to be &s;ure I cannot deny but this ma&s;ter
of his had much plea&s;ure in this &s;ort of employment:&mdash;but this made no
difference: it repaid him with intere&s;t the mo|ment it was unoccupied, and
even brought up the&s;e very actions to &s;upport its arguments, cra&s;tily
&s;ug|ge&s;ting that if there was &s;uch rich delight in le&s;&s;en|ing the
burden of our fellow creatures's mi&s;ery alone, how exqui&s;itely would the
delight be heigh|tened <PB N="41" REF="39"> by &s;haring that ta&s;k with the
object of one's af|fection.</P>
<P>It was in one of tho&s;e moments that his heart had been
dictating to him in this arrogant &s;tyle, when Emma &s;tood before him. His
a&s;toni&s;hment was exce&s;&s;ive.

<P><PB N="47" REF="45"> This propo&s;al was &s;o con&s;onant to our
hero's &s;en|timents, that he accepted it with delight. In &s;hort, the
preliminaries were adju&s;ted and agreed to, and Emma marched off in triumph,
with the ratifica|tion of her treaty.</P>
<P>Though Emma was well contented with her ne|gociation, yet her
tongue itched to enter upon an|other &s;ubject; but &s;he knew too well with
whom &s;he had to deal, to let her curio&s;ity get the better of her prudence.
It was this: &s;he had heard&mdash;nay &s;he knew it beyond doubt, or nothing
could have induced her to believe it&mdash;that our hero kept a mi&s;|tre&s;s,
that he had a private lodging for her, and vi|&s;ited her as often as his
lei&s;ure permitted.</P>
<P>This indeed was true; and though &s;he thought nothing of now
and then a random intrigue, in a young man, yet an engagement of this kind
might, e&s;pecially as he was &s;urrounded with enemies, prove of dangerous
con&s;equence to his intere&s;t in An|nette.</P>
<P>This fact, as a hi&s;torian of veracity, I am obliged to admit.
Charles certainly in his commerce with women of indifferent reputation&mdash;to
which his youth and the warmth of his con&s;titution too much 
<PB N="48" REF="46"> addicted him&mdash;had met with one who had &s;ome|thing
more decent in her manners than the re&s;t, and, upon her promi&s;e to detach
her&s;elf from her abandoned companions, he had made her comfort|able at that
time, and intended afterwards to pro|vide for her.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for Charles to have the lea&s;t de|gree of
intimacy with any per&s;on, and not be at|tached to their intere&s;t. This girl
had many at|tractions, which her lover was not in&s;en&s;ible of. Nay his word
might have been deeply engaged, had not her levity checked his hand. As it was,
he &s;tood engaged in an intercour&s;e plea&s;ureable enough, and which he
could put an end to when he plea&s;ed, without a breach of honour.</P>
<P>The moment therefore Emma went away, this he determined to do,
for he &s;wore that Annette &s;hould in future engro&s;s all his amorous
thoughts. He called immediately at the lodgings of Mi&s;s New|ton, where,
without ceremony, he entered the bed|chamber; but what was his a&s;toni&s;hment
when, in &s;o doing, he &s;aw her in bed, at twelve o'clock at noon, with the
waiter of a bagnio.</P>
<P>Charles made the gentleman jump up, very coolly 
<PB N="49" REF="47"> kicked him down &s;tairs, and threw his clothes after him.
This done, he waited on the lady, who would fir&s;t have brazened the matter
out, but finding he was ab&s;olutely bent on parting with her, &s;he
di&s;|&s;olved into tears;</P>
<P>Seizing this opportunity, he &s;aid he did not chu&s;e to be
made a dupe of; that he had conceived the comforts &s;he had ta&s;ted would
have made her better con&s;ider her own intere&s;t; but he plainly &s;aw that
&s;he could reli&s;h no plea&s;ures that were not tainted with vicious
ingratitude. He &s;hould not however upbraid her: perhaps he him&s;elf had been
to blame, in &s;uppo&s;ing that one &s;o utterly abandoned &s;hould retain a
&s;park of &s;hame or decency.</P>
<P>He added, that her furniture, watch, and indeed all he had given
her&mdash;which was no trifle&mdash;&s;he might keep: to this he &s;hould now
add a hundred pounds, which he hoped &s;he would make a good u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The lady attempted at a reply, but fell into hy&s;|terics, at
which our hero recommen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er to the maid, and walked off;
&s;aying he &s;hould &s;end a per&s;on the next day to &s;upply Mi&s;s Newton
with <PB N="50" REF="48"> &s;ome money he intended her, as &s;he was not then,
in a condition to receive it.</P>
<P>The lady, when &s;he came to her&s;elf, and under|&s;tood her
lover was gone, and, what was wor&s;e, without leaving the hundred pounds,
&s;tampt, raved, &s;ighed, &s;wore, danced, laughed, and &s;obbed, all in a
breath, and after playing fifty curious pa&s;&s;ionate antics&mdash;which &s;he
concluded by fairly kicking Betty out of the room, becau&s;e &s;he had not the
precau|tion to &s;hut the door, and &s;o prevent the di&s;covery&mdash;&s;he
breathed nothing but revenge and defiance.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s had been among the number of this lady's admirers
and had actually conferred on Charles a favour equally complai&s;ant with that
of the waiter before mentioned.</P>
<P>From this &s;ame Mr. Glo&s;s had Emma, at &s;econd hand,
received her information, backed with &s;uch circum&s;tances as it was
impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could di&s;|believe.</P>
<P>Thus was our hero &s;landered for an attempt to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tach
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> abandoned woman from her evil
life, by the very man who not only &s;hared her crime, but the wages of her

<PB REF="50">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>FULL OF INEFFECTUAL BENEVOLENCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING &s;een in what &s;tate were Charles's plea|&s;ures, I
&s;hall now look after his affairs. It has been already &s;aid that had fortune
made him very rich, he would, through the influence of his own proper
philanthropy, certainly have given the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed worthy cau&s;e to
ble&s;s him, and have been a MACAENAS, nay a little AUGUSTUS, in the opinion of
many neglected men of abilities. But this good will towards men failed, as we
have al&s;o &s;aid, for want of a certain ingredient in that &s;ort of work,
called the means. He therefore tried whe|ther, by lifting him&s;elf into power,
he could not put him&s;elf into ca&s;h, and thus accompli&s;h what he had &s;o
&s;et his heart upon. In this al&s;o he was as much to &s;eek; and what now
could he do? Why re&s;olve to embark the &s;mall remains of his fortune in the
mo&s;t fea&s;ible way that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, mak|ing general benevolence
the outline of his con|duct.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51"> Fir&s;t he purcha&s;ed a &s;hare in a place
of public amu&s;ement, which was coming to the very mart where genius was the
traffic. With what delight did he contemplate the plea&s;ure he &s;hould
receive in taking neglected merit by the hand, and patro|nizing tho&s;e
productions which the mode&s;t timidity of their author kept from the public
becau&s;e he had no patron! How rejoice when he &s;hould re&s;cue mu&s;ic from
boori&s;h barbari&s;m, and reconcile it to rea&s;on and nature!&mdash;when the
heart &s;hould receive no impre&s;&s;ion but through the ear; and when the
&s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul &s;hould fix the criterion of &s;ound! How be
charmed when theatrical painting, in&s;tead of mon&s;trous, &s;hould be
natural!</P>
<P>None of the&s;e de&s;irable ends, however, was he fortunate
enough to attain. He found his partners too refractory, and too much attached
to their own ignorant and conceited mea&s;ures to li&s;ten to him, who was but
an incon&s;iderable member among them. Vainly did he repre&s;ent that Engli&s;h
amu&s;e|ments, were they thrown into a right channel, might very ea&s;ily be
made, with alternate and never-ending variety, to charm, expand, unbend,
in&s;truct, improve the mind; and, in &s;hort, di&s;per&s;e a mo&s;t
exten&s;ive and valuable fund of entertainment, rich, delightful, and
exhilirating, as well as &s;en&s;ible, u&s;e|ful, and moral. Vainly did he
&s;hew this &s;ource, <PB N="54" REF="52"> this mine: they, poor creatures,
were &s;trangers to its value. To &s;peak plainer, they knew of no merit which
came not to them through the medium of flattery, or was not generated in their
own dullne&s;s, and foi&s;ted on the town by o&s;ten&s;ible blockheads, who
e&s;timated their works by the quantity of ma|nual labour.</P>
<P>Not content with this, our hero vi&s;ited &s;everal gentlemen of
undoubted and undeniable genius, to whom he lamented the great want of their
public exertions, and entreated the advantage of their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.
The&s;e he found had long retired in di&s;|gu&s;t: impo&s;&s;ible to bear the
affronts and humilia|tions they had &s;u&s;tained from men to whom&mdash;though
unable to judge of any thing worthy public notice&mdash;they mu&s;t implicitly
&s;ubmit, or retire; while &s;upercilious coxcombs in &s;cience, only by dint
of cringing and patronage, were to &s;et the pattern which the enlightened were
to follow.</P>
<P>Not to dwell longer at pre&s;ent on a matter &s;elf-evident to
every man of &s;en&s;e in the kingdom but our hero, he found, greatly to his
di&s;appointment, that if he had wi&s;hed to commit to de&s;truction every
trait of real merit, he had hit upon the very way of all others to effectuate
his purpo&s;e. He therefore&mdash;in imitation of tho&s;e men of genius who&s;e
di&s;gu&s;t <PB N="55" REF="53"> again&s;t managers, and pity for them&s;elves
and the degenerate age in which they lived, had been &s;o worthily
excited&mdash;&s;oon determined to retire. To do this he farmed out his &s;hare
for an annuity, which&mdash;finding it would be ill paid&mdash;he afterwards
fold for an incon&s;iderable &s;um: and thus his failure of rai&s;ing the glory
of the arts in Great Britain, co&s;t him only about eighteen hundred
pounds!</P>
<P>He was not however di&s;mayed at this. His in|tentions were the
be&s;t in the world; and how could he prevent either the vitiated ta&s;te of
the public, or the impo&s;ition of its purveyors.</P>
<P>His &s;econd &s;cheme was to give a temporary re|lief&mdash;all
he could do&mdash;to debtors, during that in|termediate detention between the
capture and the commitment to pri&s;on. He had, as I have noticed, paid a very
nice attention to arre&s;ts in the earlie&s;t &s;tages. He had come at
in&s;tances of men who, by being brutally dragged out of their &s;hops, for a
paltry &s;um, to a &s;punging hou&s;e, and kept there under various illegal
pretences for &s;everal days&mdash;though ultimately relea&s;ed&mdash;had, in
the interim, totally lo&s;t their credit, and were never again able to hold up
their heads. He had found that bailiffs, in con&s;equence of &s;uch
&s;candalous practices, and extravagant charges, at their hou&s;es, had
realized <PB N="56" REF="54"> large fortunes; nay he learnt, beyond all
contra|diction, of one who had, for a great length of time, ama&s;&s;ed
annually three thou&s;and pounds, and was &s;ure that &s;ome others were not
much behind hand; yet this intolerable expence and &s;hameful di&s;grace was
nothing to the barbarous want of feeling and diabolical unconcern which
tortured the poor debtor in this legal purgatory.</P>
<P>To remedy this evil, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, our hero hit
upon a plan that promi&s;ed good &s;ucce&s;s. He took the lea&s;e of a large
hou&s;e, had it parti|tioned into a number of convenient apartments, &s;tored
it with every proper article for his purpo&s;e, procured a victualler's
licence, and placed a man in it of whom he had the be&s;t opinion, but whom he
obliged to bring a re&s;pon&s;ible per&s;on to be joint &s;ecurity with him to
the &s;heriff.</P>
<P>To this hotel debtors were, by adverti&s;ement, advi&s;ed to go
the moment they were arre&s;ted&mdash;for it is then in their power to
in&s;i&s;t upon being carried where they plea&s;e&mdash;and there for
one-fourth, per|haps one-fifth, of that &s;um for which they would be &s;erved
with food and liquor they could neither eat nor drink, and huddled
promi&s;cuou&s;ly among filth and na&s;tine&s;s without a retreat, unle&s;s
perhaps by paying a &s;till more exorbitant price, where they 
<PB N="57" REF="55"> could con&s;ult their friends&mdash;they were neatly
ac|commodated, well &s;erved, and, in &s;hort, provided with every
plea&s;urable convenience and humane at|tention that could at &s;uch a moment
be mo&s;t agree|able to them. Added to this, an attorney of abili|ties had a
&s;alary to attend every inmate of that ho&s;|pitable man&s;ion, with advice
according to each man's different ca&s;e.</P>
<P>This liberal plan, though it was a little mad and eccentric, in
&s;omething le&s;s than two years, which time it la&s;ted, &s;aved, in the
aggregate, at lea&s;t the &s;um of nineteen thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">and pounds in hard money to a &s;et of unfortunate men
and their fami|lies, be&s;ides a world of humiliation and di&s;grace; and, what
was a &s;till greater advantage&mdash;by a fair appeal to the humanity of the
creditor, &s;hewing him the impo&s;&s;ibility of getting his money by
&s;end|ing a man to pri&s;on, conjuring him to commi&s;erate the &s;ufferings
of his fellow creatures, and other ar|guments likely to di&s;arm his
anger&mdash;at lea&s;t three hundred of tho&s;e unfortunate men who would
other|wi&s;e have gone to confinement, and who, it they did not die in it,
might almo&s;t as well do &s;o, for their credit would have been totally
lo&s;t, and their families reduced to poverty, were given back to &s;ociety,
mildly warned not to be guilty of future <PB N="58" REF="56"> indi&s;cretions,
in&s;tead of thrown into a &s;ituation where &s;trong nece&s;&s;ity, in
&s;pight of the be&s;t inten|tions, mu&s;t have inevitably plunged them into
ten times wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Our hero had a particular plea&s;ure in being in|&s;trumental
towards healing tho&s;e <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> breaches. He very often
accompanied the hou&s;e attorney, and was peculiarly happy with the credi|tor
in that kind of argument which &s;hewed him that he was like an angry &s;chool
boy, throwing one mar|ble to find another, and at la&s;t lo&s;ing both. In
&s;hort, he &s;aw his benevolent in&s;titution thrive every day, though it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, to keep-up its credit, orders were now and then
obliged to be given, that no notorious &s;windlers, or other well known
&s;harpers, might be admitted; and this was pretty well managed by enquiring
whether the deb|tors brought there were trade&s;men, or men of libe|ral
profe&s;&s;ions, or members of the church, the army, the court, or of tho&s;e
other de&s;criptions which would make it probable they were &s;uch objects as
the &s;pirit of the plan went to relieve. Yet is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that
the world received this &s;pirited in|novation on official tyranny as a mo&s;t
unbecoming attempt to de&s;troy the common u&s;uage and &s;anc|tioned
progre&s;s of the law! It was called a mad &s;cheme, and one that would
fini&s;h by converting the <PB N="59" REF="57"> hou&s;e into a receptacle for
lunatics, where the founder would be the fir&s;t per&s;on admitted.</P>
<P>One very curious thing that our hero came at through his
re&s;earches was that many of the&s;e ca&s;es originated from the folly, and
frequently &s;omething wor&s;e, of the creditors them&s;elves. An overgrown
trade&s;man would coax a neighbour of the &s;ame bu&s;i|ne&s;s into his debt,
and then arre&s;t him, to de&s;troy his credit, that &s;o the coa&s;t might be
left clear for him&s;elf. Others would fa&s;ten upon minors, whom they would
&s;upply upon long credit with bad goods, at a high price, and then arre&s;t
them the moment they became of age. Many were the in&s;tances where
book&s;ellers, mu&s;ic-&s;hops, and picture-dealers had conferred obligations
on tho&s;e arti&s;ts who had no medium but theirs through which to give their
works to the world, and who were arre&s;ted at the moment their creditor knew
it was impo&s;&s;ible to get any thing, merely that they might make over &s;ome
valuable work for a trifle.</P>
<P>Charles &s;trenuou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf upon the&s;e
occa&s;ions; but he generally found the creditor in|exorable, and the poor
devil o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a debtor obliged to
&s;ubmit to terms which mu&s;t &s;till further involve him with his hard
ta&s;k-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58"> Our hero &s;aw the folly of per&s;ua&s;ion,
and &s;till more of propo&s;ing any accommodation through his own means. Indeed
it was out of his power to give way to the dictates of his philanthropy in any
ca&s;e, which Emma, when &s;he heard of, greatly approved; for &s;he &s;aid
that Dean SWIFT, rigid as he was, could not bring his excellent plan of lending
money in &s;mall &s;ums to the perfection he wi&s;hed it, without endangering
his fortune. To which &s;he added, by way of comment, 
<Q REND="inline">'that very few but men of indif|ferent fortunes
thought liberally, which was a dread|ful bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ince none but tho&s;e
of ample ones had it in their power to act &s;o.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles neverthele&s;s found means of remitting to the wife or
daughter what a &s;trict attention to the plan demanded from the father, which
was how|ever always managed &s;o di&s;creetly, that nobody could tell from
whence it came, but by gue&s;s. Gra|titude, however, con&s;tantly gave the act
to its right owner, and thus was our hero frequently &s;landered for his
benevolence; for was it not plain that the per&s;on &s;o befriended might have
&s;tarved in pri&s;on, but for the beauty of his wife or his
daughter?&mdash;though, for aught they knew, one might be blind, and the other
deformed.</P>
<P>Charles fore&s;aw that he &s;hould incur a good deal 
<PB N="61" REF="59"> of this &s;lander, and indeed he was obliged to take an
extraordinary &s;tep at the out&s;et to avoid the im|po&s;&s;ibility of
carrying on his &s;cheme without the total ruin of his reputation. This was, to
admit no women who were arre&s;ted, le&s;t wretches, void of honour, &s;hould
be &s;ent there, upon either real or imaginary actions, to the di&s;credit of
the hou&s;e.&mdash;It is true many of the&s;e things were attempted, but when
they were peremptorily informed that there was no &s;ort of accommodation, they
&s;oon de&s;i&s;ted; and this, as much as any thing, kept away &s;harpers: for
they can herd only with women of the above de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Thus was this a&s;ylum appropriated, according to its original
in&s;titution, to men under misfortune only. It wore a &s;ober, decent
appearance, and in|&s;tead of riot, extravagance, gambling, and profli|gacy, it
exhibited a &s;ociety of people in di&s;tre&s;s, it is true, but profiting by
each other's advice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Women of credit and reputation were
not a&s;hamed to be &s;een there, and the con&s;olation of near and tender
relations was never interrupted by rude and brutal intimidations; nor was any
opportunity ever lo&s;t of cheering the wretched, and &s;oftening the
&s;ufferings of the unfortunate.</P>
<P>In the mean time a number of unplea&s;ant at|tempts 
<PB N="62" REF="60"> were made to de&s;troy this de&s;irable a&s;ylum for the
afflicted. Bailiffs make fortunes in two ways; by either carrying a man to
their hou&s;es, and &s;o &s;punging upon him till he is drained of all his
money, or el&s;e by taking a compliment, as they call it, in proportion to the
&s;um for which he is ar|re&s;ted, and then taking his word: that is to &s;ay,
letting him go. Now it happened that our hero's plan &s;o trenched upon this
fir&s;t method, that they were obliged, oftener than had been their cu&s;tom,
to have recour&s;e to the &s;econd. Thus, being obliged to trade upon an
unu&s;ual ri&s;k, &s;everal of them, who did not properly know their men, came
into &s;crapes, and nothing among them was talked of but motions of court,
&s;u&s;pen&s;ions, and other un&s;ea&s;onable mat|ters, which made them look
about them in earne&s;t; for they plainly &s;aw that if Charles's a&s;ylum was
found to be of public utility, and taken up upon a larger plan, bailiffs might
even return to their for|mer vocations of knights of the po&s;t, bullies to
bawdy hou&s;es, thief-takers, and runners to gaols.</P>
<P>With a number of &s;uch low enemies again&s;t him, no wonder if
our hero met with a thou&s;and in&s;ults. It will not however be &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;pin out trifling matters, as to enumerate them. He
never failed to put the law &s;everely in force again&s;t them, whenever they
infringed their duty; and as to any <PB N="63" REF="61"> thing el&s;e, he held
it beneath him to notice it.&mdash;But now a matter of &s;erious con&s;equence
indeed happened to him. He was one evening arre&s;ted for three thou&s;and
pounds. Suppo&s;ing this &s;ome manoeuvre that he could ea&s;ily get rid of to
the confu&s;ion of the tribe of the catch poles, he in&s;i&s;ted upon going to
his own hou&s;e of &s;ecurity, but this favour was peremptorily denied him,
with an in|formation that the officer who kept it was &s;u&s;|pended; for that
he had connived at the e&s;cape of a per&s;on who had been confined there for a
debt of three thou&s;and pounds, that the &s;heriff had been fixed for the
debt, and now came upon him as one of the &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the fellow who had &s;o long kept his credit with
our hero, in the execution of his tru&s;t as &s;heriff's officer&mdash;a
po&s;t, as we have &s;een, that may be filled with reputation&mdash;after
having been a long time tampered with, and yet re&s;i&s;ting every temptation,
was at la&s;t overcome.</P>
<P>A &s;windler owed virtually to one man a thou|&s;and pounds, but
literally three thou&s;and. The cir|cum&s;tance is worth attending to. This one
man was a ra&s;cally attorney, found out by a &s;et of as ra&s;|cally bailiffs,
who were determined to knock up <PB N="64" REF="62"> Charles's plan. He &s;ent
for the &s;windler, a&s;ked him the amount of all his debts, and was informed
they were &s;omething more than three thou&s;and pounds. He was then de&s;ired
to inform him&s;elf whether they could not be paid with a thou&s;and..</P>
<P>This enquiry was made, and it was found they could; for he had
no creditor but would be glad to take a third for the whole, &s;eeing they
&s;tood no other chance of getting any.</P>
<P>Before any further &s;tep was taken, the &s;ecurity of Charles's
factotum was tampered with&mdash;at fir&s;t di&s;tantly&mdash;who appearing not
very &s;hy, as they called it, was at length plainly informed how he might
touch a thou&s;and pounds. In &s;hort, finding him apt, they propo&s;ed, if he
could prevail on the officer to connive at an e&s;cape, they &s;hould receive a
thou&s;and pounds each. The affairs of the &s;ecurity were going down, and he
had no doubt but he &s;hould induce his friend to con&s;ent. In &s;hort, the
&s;cruples of both were at length overcome.</P>
<P>This being accompli&s;hed, the &s;windler's debts were paid with
a thou&s;and pounds, the attorney re|ceived documents which made him appear to
&s;tand in the &s;hoes of the creditors to the amount of three 
<PB N="65" REF="63"> thou&s;and pounds. For this &s;um was the &s;windler
arre&s;ted; for this &s;um was the &s;heriff fixed, in con|&s;equence of his
e&s;cape; and for this &s;um&mdash;after the factotum and his &s;ecurity were
paid their money, and fairly put into a po&s;t chai&s;e&mdash;was our hero four
days in cu&s;tody: at the end of which time, rather inconveniently, he paid the
money, and procured his enlargement.</P>
<P>Thus did the attorney, who was o&s;ten&s;ible for the bailiffs,
receive the original money they had ad|vanced, bribe their agent with double
that &s;um, procure the &s;windler's liberty, and all at Charles's
expence;&mdash;who now &s;aw it would be utterly impo&s;|&s;ible for him to
carry his humane plan any far|ther.</P>
<P>Bigoted however to his project, and having &s;een the be&s;t
effects from it, he waited on men of larger fortune, with a view to advi&s;e
with them how to perfect an undertaking of &s;uch material utility.&mdash;He
expo&s;ed the conduct of it with the minute&s;t nicety, and &s;hewed how much
money, as well as happine&s;s, he had been the in&s;trument of re&s;toring to
his fellow creatures in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Unfortunately he was di&s;appointed in every
ap|plication!&mdash;for <PB N="66" REF="64"> finding, after a critical
&s;tatement of the accounts, that he had at no time made &s;even per cent. of
his money&mdash;indeed he did not make more than four, for he in&s;erted none
of tho&s;e ex|pences to be laid to the account of his benefac|tions&mdash;he
could not find a &s;ingle creature to engage in it.</P>
<P>His la&s;t application was to the &s;heriffs, but their an&s;wer
was that they had no notion of putting the bu&s;ine&s;s out of the common
channel; and indeed they were no friends to the &s;cheme, for it had in|jured
the emoluments of their office, by preventing the accumulation of arre&s;ts.
Nay they had heard men in power hint that it was an idle, meddling &s;cheme,
and, among other public inconveniences, it had decrea&s;ed the &s;tamp
duty.</P>
<P>As the limits of our hero's fortune would not permit him to
become &s;ecurity again for a per&s;on to manage the hou&s;e, and as it would
an&s;wer no end to let it to a thorough bred &s;heriff's officer, he was
obliged to drop the affair: lamenting that his circum&s;tances were &s;o
&s;traitened, that he could not carry it to that perfection he wi&s;hed; and
feeling &s;everely for the dignity of human nature, when he reflected that in
all his re&s;earches he had not <PB N="67" REF="65"> been able to transfer
benevolence upon the ea&s;y terms of good pecuniary intere&s;t, &s;weetened
with the benedictions of the unfortunate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>MORE SCHEMING UPON A SANDY FOUNDATION, AN UNJUST TRIAL AND
CONVICTION, AND ONE EXULTATION QUASHED BY ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT I may carry our hero the whole length of his tether while I
am about it, I &s;hall proced to plan the third, though it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved
that the&s;e &s;chemes were all in agitation at once: &s;o full of vivacity
were his actions when he panted to &s;uccour his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>This third &s;cheme went to the relief of the poor at large, and
indeed &s;o did the fourth. One was a plan to &s;ell them bread under the
&s;tandard price, and the other meat.</P>
<P>To carry the fir&s;t into execution, a water-mill was built, and
a bakehou&s;e annexed to it. The matter was found very practicable; the
original money yielded at lea&s;t &s;ix per cent. and the poor, even then, were
&s;erved with better bread, and &s;aved <PB N="69" REF="67"> at lea&s;t a penny
out of every &s;ixpence. Nothing could be more &s;imple, nor more effective.
The &s;parring of the bakers was more ea&s;ily kept within bounds than that of
the bailiffs. Indeed, as our hero meant to make his expences the ground of a
memorial for the better regulation of &s;o material an article, his competitors
were rather inclined to con|ciliate than aggravate matters.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme for regulating the price of meat could not be
conducted in a manner &s;o within him&s;elf as the other. He therefore could
not avoid connecting him&s;elf with a grazier and a butcher. In the choice of
the&s;e he u&s;ed every precaution his mo&s;t watchful and diligent prudence
could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>At length, having &s;ettled the matter to his mind, the plan was
began and carried on, for &s;ome time, with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s, though
he could not re|&s;train his partners from making more intere&s;t for their
money than he wi&s;hed: yet, with the&s;e and many other clogs upon it, the
advantages to the poor were con&s;iderable. The fore&s;tallers however at
la&s;t &s;o hara&s;&s;ed and inconvenienced the concern, that in about &s;even
weeks after the ho&s;pitable a&s;y|lum was put down, our hero had the
mortification to &s;ee his name in the Gazette, as partner of Daniel 
<PB N="70" REF="68"> Driver and Anthony Garbage, graziers, butchers, dealers
and chapmen.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the young gentleman in a &s;tate of
a&s;toni&s;hment before; how he felt at this intelligence we can the readier
conceive. But &s;till his &s;ituation varied a little from the re&s;t. He never
&s;aw him&s;elf before upon the brink of poverty. However, after the fir&s;t
&s;hock, he received great con&s;olation from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his
own good intentions, and he contented him&s;elf with only adding to the fir&s;t
tran&s;port of his indignation&mdash;which was pretty vio|lent&mdash;that men
were wolves and vultures, and that the greate&s;t act of madne&s;s a man could
be guilty of, was an attempt to civilize them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took was an endeavour to &s;uper|&s;ede
the bankruptcy, as far as related to him&s;elf; upon a plea that he was able to
&s;atisfy his own cre|ditors, by paying twenty &s;hillings in the pound.</P>
<P>Poor, inexperienced young man! He little knew that was the
wor&s;t plea he could offer. It availed him nothing. His effects were
overhauled, his mill was &s;old, and, after obtaining his certificate in form,
he found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no more than between three and four
hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="69"> Thus were overthrown all our projector's
hopes! which, though they certainly were a &s;y&s;tem of re|form utterly beyond
his ability to mature, yet he &s;urely merited no reproach for having made
&s;uch a laudable attempt.</P>
<P>As I have already ob&s;erved, there never was per|haps an
in&s;tance of a well-di&s;po&s;ed young man who was in &s;o trying a way let
alone entirely to the bent of his own di&s;po&s;ition. That di&s;po&s;ition
evidently led him to alleviate the wants of his fellow crea|tures. If in this
he aimed at more than he could accompli&s;h, let it be attributed to a liberal,
ex|panded propen&s;ity to confer benefits; a noble, giv|ing, beneficent
principle of action, which mu&s;t be endowed in an uncommon degree with
courageous genero&s;ity, to ri&s;k, in &s;upplying the wants of others, the
exi&s;tence of that &s;ource from which tho&s;e wants were &s;upplied.</P>
<P>As to the vehicles through which this benevolence was
di&s;pen&s;ed, they certainly wanted riper experi|ence, more con&s;equence, and
a larger fund to ma|nage them; for, as it was, our hero's
conduct&mdash;e&s;pecially as to his two fir&s;t &s;chemes&mdash;was a &s;ort
of Quixoti&s;m in liberality. But yet, had the folly been ten times more
egregious, it was &s;till but folly; whereas the intention in &s;o young a man,
&s;o <PB N="72" REF="70"> unadvi&s;ed, &s;o left to his own propen&s;ities,
requires a word to expre&s;s its de&s;erts much &s;tronger than any dictionary
will give us, and which one might have an idea of by fancying&mdash;if one
could do &s;o without violating language&mdash;&s;omething that implied a
mean|ing about ten times as expre&s;&s;ive as the &s;uperlative degree of
admirable.</P>
<P>Nine out of ten however reviled Charles's con|duct in the mo&s;t
humiliating terms. He had a hundred nick names. He was the infant Her|cules;
the mad projector; the opulent beggar; the beneficent catchpole; Timon in
tatters; and ninety-five other things, all as good as the&s;e. But in the
mid&s;t of this, it mu&s;t have mortified his ene|mies to death, and rai&s;ed
the prai&s;e of all good men to that very un&s;peakable degree of admiration I
mentioned in the la&s;t paragraph, had they accom|panied the gradual decline of
his circum&s;tances with remarks on his becoming conduct, and then &s;een how
he &s;at him&s;elf down in adver&s;ity!</P>
<P>When fir&s;t he returned to England, he had an elegant hou&s;e,
and kept his carriage. The moment he was out of parliament, he &s;old off his
carriage, took a &s;maller hou&s;e, and lived more privately; till, &s;tep by
&s;tep, we now &s;ee him only decently lodged, with an old gentlewoman, who had
been <PB N="73" REF="71"> his hou&s;ekeeper, for his only attendant. Yet did
every &s;ixpence of tho&s;e &s;uperfluities he curtailed go to relieve the
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; for it was his con&s;tant method to retreat in time, that
&s;o nothing might be &s;pared to accompli&s;h his great and liberal
pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething al&s;o beautiful, and I hope it &s;o
&s;trikes the reader, in reflecting that when Charles was driven to the
nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;carding all his &s;ervants but one, he &s;hould retain
the olde&s;t and mo&s;t helple&s;s among the number; and, to fini&s;h this
picture, if it has &s;o far intere&s;ted the reader, let it melt him into
friendly generous &s;ympathy, when I heighten it by bringing on a grateful
hone&s;t group of now happy objects, through the means of his beneficence,
lamenting the &s;tate to which alone his compa&s;&s;ionate genero&s;ity had
reduced him; vent|ing their admiration of a mind &s;o charitable, yet &s;o
young; invoking benedictions on his head, for the benefits they had
them&s;elves, through him, and from his hands, received; and conjuring him to
accept their thankful mite, for his pre&s;ent a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I can only &s;ay that no glutton ever &s;at down to a banquet
with half the &s;atisfaction that Charles felt at this &s;ight. He thanked them
with tears; a&s;&s;ured <PB N="74" REF="72"> them that his &s;ituation was a
trifling concern, &s;ince it had mended theirs; that he had re&s;ources, and
&s;o little repented of what had pa&s;t, that had he again fifteen thou&s;and
pounds, he would give it with plea&s;ure to have the charming &s;atisfaction of
enjoying &s;uch another moment.</P>
<P>During all this time our hero's corre&s;pondence with Annette
went on variou&s;ly. Sometimes Emma was obliged to be extremely cautious, and,
at other times, all caution was altogether as unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;This
happened ju&s;t as Charles ro&s;e or &s;unk in the opinion of Sir Sidney, who
had really&mdash;finding him &s;uch an original&mdash;watched his conduct with
great attention.</P>
<P>In parliament he had remarked that though there was great
&s;ingularity in it, there was al&s;o great con|&s;i&s;tency, and, what was
better, great integrity:&mdash;and much about the time when Emma adju&s;ted the
corre&s;pondence between the lovers, was really in|clined to think that he had
been wronged, or that he had the &s;trange&s;t mixture of good and ill
quali|ties in him that ever was heard of, when Mr. Glo&s;s contrived, while Sir
Sidney's &s;entiments were in this equipoi&s;e, to make our hero's virtues kick
the beam with a &s;ingle fillup.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="73"> In &s;hort, he had then, as u&s;ual, an
opportunity of turning one of his good actions into the appear|ance of a very
bad one, and he had no doubt but, by this means, he &s;hould be able to make
the ba|ronet's dubious thoughts preponderate on the &s;ide that would be
lea&s;t to Charles's advantage.</P>
<P>Glo&s;s took the very fir&s;t opportunity that he heard Sir
Sidney &s;ay any thing tending to Charles's prai&s;e of remarking that good men
were always the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be impo&s;ed upon; and in this he &s;aid very
true, for he was then going to impo&s;e upon Sir Sid|ney. He followed this
declaration up with ano|ther, expre&s;&s;ing his great reluctance that it
&s;hould fall to his lot to bring forward accu&s;ations conti|nually again&s;t
Mr. Hazard, and, in particular, le&s;t the cen&s;orious world&mdash;for he was
&s;ure Sir Sidney would do him more ju&s;tice&mdash;&s;hould think he had a
farther intere&s;t in &s;uch conduct than mere impar|tial ju&s;tice, and a
de&s;ire that a gentleman &s;o dear to him, and indeed to the world in general,
&s;hould undeceive him&s;elf in an opinion unde&s;ervedly enter|tained of one
who not only plunged him&s;elf every day into &s;ome fre&s;h vice, but indeed
&s;eemed to &s;et &s;hame and even decency at defiance. He in&s;i&s;ted that
benevolence extended to bad objects was a &s;ort of crime; it was a tacit
admi&s;&s;ion, though not approval, of their conduct; and might, in men to 
<PB N="76" REF="74"> whom the world looked up, as it did to Sir Sidney for
example, be &s;o con&s;trued. He took the liberty to add, that if his dear
friend had a foible&mdash;though to be &s;ure it was amiable in the
extreme&mdash;this was it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, after a proper do&s;e of gilded flattery, he
informed the baronet that it was then a week &s;ince our hero had turned a poor
wretch, whom he had &s;educed from her friends, into the &s;treets, with all
the &s;hocking circum&s;tances of &s;hame and wretchedne&s;s. The way he came
to the truth of this was, the mi&s;erable creature, hearing he was one of Mr.
Hazard's friends, had called upon him, and related the whole &s;hocking
bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;uch &s;implicity and apparent truth, that he had been
in|duced to relieve her, and intended vi&s;iting her fa|ther, to try if he
could not prevail on him to re|ceive his repentant child into the bo&s;om of
her fa|mily.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney &s;eemed greatly &s;hocked with this &s;tory, and,
upon Mr. Glo&s;s's repeated entreaty, con&s;ented not only to &s;ee this
unhappy girl, but to u&s;e his intere&s;t with her father, who was, it &s;eems,
a &s;ub&s;tantial trade&s;man, to take her back again.</P>
<P>Not to let the matter cool, the baronet &s;aw the 
<PB N="77" REF="75"> young lady, was afterwards introduced to a per&s;on who
kept wine vaults in Petty France, who con|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her father, and
had the good fortune, after u&s;ing a variety of arguments, fir&s;t to prevail
on him to &s;ee, and afterwards forgive, the reclaimed &s;inner; to whom Sir
Sidney pre&s;ented one fifty pounds, and Mr. Glo&s;s another, accon panied with
good coun&s;el, in &s;ome men's e&s;timation, to fifty times that value.</P>
<P>The &s;tory the young lady told Sir Sidney, was briefly this:
that Charles had taken uncommon pains to &s;educe her, but being tired with
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, had now turned her off: that &s;he verily believed, dearly
as &s;he loved him, and ever &s;hould, his prin|cipal motive in a connection
with her was intere&s;t. This the gentleman in Petty France believed too; for
he a&s;&s;ured Sir Sidney that when &s;he went off &s;he carried two hundred
pounds with her. But, the lady &s;aid, had he found his account in this
expec|tation, &s;he did not think &s;he &s;hould have kept him long, for &s;he
&s;oon found that he had fallen in love with a girl who&s;e mother he had taken
out of a &s;punging hou&s;e; and this &s;he &s;aid was &s;o true, that the
mother lived with him at that time, in quality of hou&s;ekeeper, and the
daughter was put out to a milliner, in a hou&s;e where &s;he was to be taken in
<PB N="78" REF="76"> partner&s;hip, when her apprentice&s;hip &s;hould be
ex|pired.</P>
<P>Many circum&s;tances were adduced to prove the truth of the&s;e
allegations, and as far as it related to our hero's prote&s;tations, though
they were but in general terms, there was enough under his hand|writing, which
Sir Sidney knew, to corroborate his connection with her, and parting from her,
par|ticularly the latter, in which the baronet thought he di&s;covered a
remarkable vein of cruel and in|&s;ulting levity.</P>
<P>I believe it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add that the lady
was Mi&s;s Newton; that &s;he had been tutored by Glo&s;s; that the man at the
wine vaults was oc|ca&s;ionally a convenient friend of hers; that the&s;e two
divided Sir Sidney's bounty, and gave Glo&s;s's back again. This admitted, our
hero's letters will not appear extraordinary, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, at which
the baronet was &s;o incen&s;ed, which accom|panied the hundred pounds he
&s;ent her the day af|ter he had detected her; and as it happened, ac|cording
to the partial con&s;truction now put upon it, to apply &s;o directly in favour
of the lady, by exhibiting a want of feeling in the gentleman, I &s;hall here
in&s;ert it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The reader, who is with me in the &s;ecret, will find this
letter quite delicate. It laughs off a very great injury; it is, be&s;ides, in
a &s;tyle well adapted to the per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed; and there
is &s;omething very delicate in the circum&s;tance of taking no notice of what
it enclo&s;ed. We however mu&s;t commend Sir Sidney, and had we been, as he
was, ignorant of the real truth, we &s;hould have thought as he did.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that, in &s;pight of Glo&s;s's
moderation, Sir Sidney exulted a little at this &s;tory. <PB N="80" REF="78">
He came home full of it, and as he had &s;een Charles's hand-writing, and
be&s;ides nobody could think of doubting his veracity, even Emma her&s;elf was,
for the pre&s;ent, unprepared, or at lea&s;t ap|peared &s;o, to defend her
favourite, which indeed vexed her not a little; becau&s;e &s;he had ju&s;t got
the corre&s;pondence in &s;uch a nice train. She contented her&s;elf therefore
with &s;aying, that it had been &s;aid there were two ALEXANDERS; one
invincible, the &s;on of PHILIP; the other inimitable, the production of
APELLES. At pre&s;ent it might be &s;aid there were two Mr. Hazards: one good
and benevolent, repre&s;ented by the world; the other vile and diabo|lical,
painted by Mr. Glo&s;s. That for her part, &s;he did not approve of premature
condemnations: they were generally repented of. They had not yet heard both
&s;ides of the que&s;tion, except in one in&s;tance, where Mr. Hazard was
cleared greatly to his honour. She &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not have &s;crupled to
di&s;believe the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, but for the circum&s;tance of the
letters. With that proof &s;he &s;hould re&s;t contented; for Sir Sidney had
the evi|dence of his own &s;en&s;es to go upon. She wi&s;hed mo&s;t truly he
would never credit any thing but through that medium.</P>
<P>She allowed the young gentleman had failings, nor was it to be
wondered at. TELEMACHUS, though <PB N="81" REF="79"> with Minerva for his
guide, fell into the errors of his father. What mu&s;t this young man do,
help|le&s;s and alone?&mdash;who never had occa&s;ion for his friends till he
had lo&s;t them:&mdash;and how lo&s;t them? It was not then a moment to
inve&s;tigate that. She &s;hould therefore &s;ay &s;he acquie&s;ced in the
truth of our hero's faults, but it &s;hould be upon this condi|tion, that if he
had weakne&s;s, it was the weakne&s;s of an angel.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney begged &s;he would retain her good opi|nion of Mr.
Hazard: it was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with her romantic notions: but
de&s;ired &s;he would not &s;o far make a novel of the bu&s;ine&s;s, as to let
her friend&s;hip interfere with her duty.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid Emma, 'if to have your intere&s;t
ten|derly at heart be to neglect my duty, no duty was ever &s;o
neglected.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Come, come,' &s;aid Glo&s;s, 'you need not
vaunt your fidelity, Mrs. Emma, till it is di&s;puted:&mdash;we &s;ee what you
are.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is ea&s;ily &s;een,' an&s;wered Emma, very
mildly, 'what I am, and it will one day &s;ir be &s;een what you are,
and&mdash;Mr. Glo&s;s&mdash;WHO you are.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="80"> Sir Sidney would certainly have rebuked
Emma very &s;harply for this &s;trange freedom, but that he &s;aw, at the
in&s;tant it was uttered, the &s;tronge&s;t marks of confu&s;ion in the
countenance of Glo&s;s.&mdash;The&s;e, to be &s;ure, he endeavoured to pa&s;s
off, by hinting that the liberty Mrs. Emma had taken was very extraordinary:
but this he did &s;o &s;lightly&mdash;fearing probably a few more of tho&s;e
choke pears&mdash;that the baronet was a&s;&s;ured &s;o &s;ignificant an
expre&s;|&s;ion would not have been levelled by Emma, or received by him in the
manner it had, were there not &s;omething of an extraordinary nature couched
under it. He thought however the wi&s;e&s;t way at pre&s;ent would be to break
up the conver&s;ation. He therefore told Emma he was a&s;&s;ured &s;he had the
be&s;t intentions, and begged Mr. Glo&s;s would forgive her, if any thing &s;he
had &s;aid in her ha&s;te offended him.</P>
<P>Glo&s;s took him at his word with great eagerne&s;s, totally
unlike him&s;elf, and this augmented Sir Sid|ney's &s;u&s;picions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER MATTER, A HISTORY WHICH THE READER WILL
NOT IMMEDIATELY SEE THE DRIFT OF.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Now it happened that had Emma found it con|venient &s;he could
have con&s;uted the whole of this calumny, and in a way greatly to our hero's
honour; but this would have brought up matters which, in &s;pight of all her
diligence, were not yet ripe enough for inve&s;tigation. The fact is that &s;he
had made her&s;elf not a little unea&s;y at this very circum|&s;tance before,
which &s;he had fir&s;t learnt through &s;ome invidious intimations from
Glo&s;s, and had very carefully watched the matter, till at length her fears
were at an end upon our hero's leaving Mi&s;s New|ton, owing, &s;he had no
doubt, to the more agree|able commerce in which &s;he had now engaged him; and
this rou&s;ed in her a reflection greatly to his credit; for if the bare
mention of a corre&s;pondence with a woman of honour could induce &s;uch a
youth to give up a guilty connection un&s;olicited, what might not have been
expected from him had his <PB N="84" REF="82"> other pur&s;uits been
&s;anctioned by the advice of &s;en&s;i|ble and re&s;pectable friends. And yet
prudence had whi&s;pered to Emma that it was certainly, but yet barely,
po&s;&s;ible for Charles to have given up Mi&s;s Newton in compliment to his
hou&s;ekeeper's daugh|ter. This bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, &s;he made a point of
coming at; to do which, &s;he vi&s;ited the old lady one day when our hero, as
&s;he knew, was engaged at his mill, about five miles out of town.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in this old lady that had be|fore
&s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Emma in her favour, and as the latter came not
out of any improper curio|&s;ity, to make an advantage of any thing &s;he
&s;hould hear to the other's di&s;advantage, and as the former had never made a
&s;ecret of the &s;tory, but, on the contrary, though again&s;t our hero's
will, taken every opportunity of &s;inging forth his prai&s;es, by repeating
the circum&s;tances of it as far as he had been concerned in it, to every one
who a&s;ked it, it will not either &s;urpri&s;e the reader to hear that Emma
got out of the old gentlewoman the particu|lars of her whole life, or that when
&s;he had done &s;o, &s;he admired the extraordinary goodne&s;s of Charles more
than ever:&mdash;and here the reader will reflect with double plea&s;ure that
this was the very dome&s;tic, or rather companion, he retained in his
circum|&s;tances of adver&s;e fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="83"> The old lady having fir&s;t, like Othello,
told her &s;tory in parcels, Emma begged to have it from her youth up: the
which to hear did &s;he mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly incline. What &s;he told at
length, I &s;hall give the reader briefly; for I have no time for &s;pinning
out narratives.</P>
<P>She was the daughter of a gentleman, who had a life place in a
public office, and had been thrown very early in life, with a &s;mall fortune,
into the protection of an aunt, who unfortunately being a woman of intrigue,
connived at her ruin. Her &s;e|ducer, by whom &s;he had a child, was a
clergyman; but as he &s;oon left her, &s;he was compa&s;&s;ionated by another
relation, who took her home, obliged the father to take the child, which was a
boy, and got her fortune out of the hands of her aunt.</P>
<P>It was not many months before a re&s;pectable trade&s;man paid
his addre&s;&s;es to her, and, in &s;pight of her misfortune, offered her his
hand; nay, he was the warmer on that account. He knew &s;he had been betrayed
by a wicked woman and a &s;inner in the garb of a &s;aint, and therefore wanted
a pro|tector. In &s;hort, they became man and wife, and had lived in great
credit five-and-twenty years, when falling into difficulties, through the
villany of &s;ome notorious &s;windlers, and innocently getting 
<PB N="86" REF="84"> the ill will of a pettifogging attorney, her hu&s;band,
who&s;e name was Marlow, was one of tho&s;e who&s;e reputation had been totally
ruined by vexatious arre&s;ts, in the way I have already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Our hero &s;trenuou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf in the poor man's
behalf, and with great difficulty&mdash;but not till all his connections,
&s;cared by this temporary misfortune, had de&s;erted him&mdash;obtained his
liberty from a &s;punging hou&s;e, where he laid thirteen days in a mo&s;t
cheerle&s;s condition, during which time he was witne&s;s to the riotous
profligacy of &s;ome of tho&s;e very men who had wilfully cau&s;ed his
misfortunes.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of his credit, added to a &s;evere cold he had caught
by lying in a damp bed, threw him into a fever, which, in &s;pight of every
caution, hurried him out of the world in a very &s;hort time. He died
recommending his widow and her daughter to the protection of our hero, now the
only friend he had in the world.</P>
<P>The old lady, as it has been &s;hewn, was appointed Charles's
hou&s;ekeeper, and the young one, who was the only remaining child out of
eleven, was put into bu&s;ine&s;s exactly in the manner Mr. Glo&s;s re|lated,
who always made it a rule to keep truth as <PB N="87" REF="85"> much in view as
he conveniently could in all his &s;tories.</P>
<P>This was the account that Emma, had &s;he found it expedient,
might have oppo&s;ed to the other; to which al&s;o &s;he was prepared to add,
that &s;o far from his having &s;educed Mi&s;s Newton, &s;he was not only a
notoriou&s;ly abandoned character, but that Mr. Glo&s;s knew it. She contented
her&s;elf however with the few hints &s;he had given, which &s;he was plea&s;ed
to find had told ju&s;t as &s;he wi&s;hed they &s;hould.</P>
<P>If Emma was however &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent, I cannot
&s;ay &s;o much for Sir Sidney, who, the fir&s;t time he was alone with his
lady, a&s;ked her freely her &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, and, in
particular, how &s;he could account for the freedom of Emma's conduct.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck &s;aid he might be a&s;&s;ured there was not in
exi&s;tence a more faithful creature; that, however, no duty could induce her
to be what &s;he conceived ungrateful, or unju&s;t; that &s;he had cer|tainly
the highe&s;t opinion of Mr. Hazard, and had &s;et her heart upon his union
with Annette; but that as his fortune daily dimini&s;hed, and the preten&s;ions
of Mr. Glo&s;s were daily more and more e&s;tabli&s;hed, <PB N="88" REF="86">
&s;he trembled for her favourite, of whom &s;he would not credit any ill, till
every thing could be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by a fair inve&s;tigation; which, for her
own part, &s;eeing neither &s;ide was willing to make the fir&s;t motion, &s;he
thought would never take place.</P>
<P>One great proof, Lady Roebuck &s;aid, both of the attachment of
Emma, and the delicacy of tho&s;e &s;entiments by which &s;he &s;upported it,
was, that though her predelection in favour of Mr. Hazard was evident, yet
&s;he had never u&s;ed any unbecom|ing arguments to Annette on the &s;ubject;
but, con|trary to this, had always held out that the com|mands of her
father&mdash;which only urged her to make an effort to overcome that affection
which to be &s;ure the whole family had formerly &s;anctioned&mdash;were very
lenient, and truly characteri&s;tic of the charming mind of a parent, who had,
upon every occa&s;ion, been remarkable for his indulgence to|wards his
daughter.</P>
<P>In this however Lady Roebuck neither told nor knew the truth;
for Emma privately kept up her affection for Charles, and increa&s;ed her
aver&s;ion to Glo&s;s.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' &s;aid Sir Sidney, 'what meant that
&s;trange &s;ide accu&s;ation of Mr. Glo&s;s? What did &s;he mean 
<PB N="89" REF="87"> by &s;aying it would be known who he was? Had I not been
aver&s;e to lower the con&s;equence of a gentleman before a dependant, I would
have in|&s;i&s;ted on an explanation of that expre&s;&s;ion.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady Roebuck went on in the&s;e words. 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Sir Sidney, you know with what
reluctance I have ever ventured to &s;ay a word on this &s;ubject. I own I have
been my&s;elf greatly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of Mr. Hazard. We all, at
one time, e&s;|teemed him as a mo&s;t amiable young man, and though we have had
what has been thought &s;trong proofs again&s;t him, yet, as Emma &s;ays, only
one &s;ide of the que&s;tion has been heard, and I confe&s;s, from &s;ome
internal impul&s;e, which may per|haps be the effect of my &s;anguine wi&s;hes
for this young gentleman's welfare&mdash;which wi&s;hes were in&s;pired by the
dying and pathetic reque&s;t of his mother, for whom we had all a tender
friend|&s;hip&mdash;I cannot yet con&s;ent to pronounce him, from my own
conviction, guilty of &s;uch very enormous offences, which could not be
perpe|trated but by a mind capable of the mo&s;t hardened and incorrigible
wickedne&s;s: a di&s;po&s;ition which is rarely produced &s;uddenly, and of
which his, by what we have &s;een of it, promi&s;ed exactly the
rever&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88"> 
<Q REND="inline">'While I &s;ay this however, continued Lady
Roe|buck, 'I will not contend how far the&s;e feelings are right. They may be
fal&s;ely entertained, perhaps, impelled by the motives I have men|tioned,
while your riper judgment and better know|ledge of the world have enabled you
to form a truer and more decided opinion of the truth; in which ca&s;e it would
be &s;trange vanity, however right my intentions, in entertaining the&s;e
&s;enti|ments, if I did not, as upon all other occa&s;ions, implicitly &s;ubmit
to yours.'</Q></P>
<P>Sir Sidney ki&s;&s;ed her, perhaps for her obedience; &s;aid
&s;he was a charming creature, and de&s;ired her to go on.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to Annette,' added Lady Roebuck, 'I &s;hall
there be &s;till more backward to give either advice or opinion, for very many
rea&s;ons, nece&s;&s;arily de|licate; but one is, which is the mo&s;t
plea&s;urable, that never was advice to a young, tender, &s;en&s;ible creature
&s;o little needed: &s;he is all you can wi&s;h from inclination, or hope from
duty: yet I ho|ne&s;tly believe &s;he regards Mr. Hazard more warmly than any
other per&s;on in the world. Not however that her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his
favour has made her &s;entiments to Mr. Glo&s;s otherwi&s;e than they would
have been had &s;he never &s;een him. <PB N="91" REF="89"> She deports
her&s;elf, upon all occa&s;ions, with that &s;weet native dignity in which
pure, unaffected loveline&s;s is &s;ure to be &s;een, and therefore Mr. Glo&s;s
has had no rea&s;on to complain of receiving that portion of her favour which
all tho&s;e com|mand from her who come &s;anctioned with the partiality of her
father; but, be a&s;&s;ured, that at pre&s;ent he is almo&s;t the la&s;t
per&s;on in the world &s;he wi&s;hes to think of as a hu&s;band. Yet I will not
&s;ay, that were you &s;o far to exert the authority of a father, as to
in&s;i&s;t upon her marrying him, &s;he would refu&s;e; for I &s;incerely
believe &s;he has &s;o &s;ingular a &s;en&s;e of implicit duty, that &s;he
would give up her own happine&s;s to promote yours.&mdash;This allowed, every
thing remains well: you will never exert &s;o rigorous a duty, and &s;he will
never take any &s;teps to di&s;oblige you.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon my &s;oul,' &s;aid Sir Sidney, 'it is
impo&s;|&s;ible to hear you without being charmed: you have &s;o the knack of
&s;moothing every difficulty. It is not wonderful there &s;hould be &s;uch
perfection in Annette, when &s;he can look up to you for her example.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear,' an&s;wered Lady Roebuck, 'what|ever
little my a&s;&s;iduity and endeavours have ef|fected in the blamele&s;s and
admirably-regulated <PB N="92" REF="90"> conduct of your daughter, Emma's care
and at|tention have performed a great deal more. That good, that
a&s;toni&s;hing creature, makes virtue the mo&s;t endearing thing in the world,
and contrives to give its attractions a winning cheerfulne&s;s, that induces
its performance not more as a duty than as a familiar and enchanting
plea&s;ure. Much more yet however is owing to Annette her&s;elf, the
&s;weetne&s;s of who&s;e unaffected manners, the gaiety of who&s;e angelic
d&s;po&s;ition, and the un|&s;ullied purity of who&s;e charming mind,
anticipate every attempt to in&s;pire goodne&s;s; for where &s;hould we find
virtue but in its abode?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'All this only convinces me,' &s;aid the
baronet, 'that I ought to con&s;ider my&s;elf the happie&s;t hu&s;|band and
father in the world. As to Emma, I readily believe her a prodigy of honour and
in|tegrity. All I have to find fault with is, that &s;he is often
unnece&s;&s;arily zealous, and that her virtue is now and then a little too
outrageous. One in|&s;tance of this we have recently &s;een, and I &s;hould be
glad to know if you can po&s;&s;ibly give a gue&s;s at what &s;he would be at;
for I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have an anxious de&s;ire to know, and yet am very
unwilling to re&s;ort to her for intelligence: there|fore, as you &s;aw, I put
an end to the conver&s;a|tion.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="91"> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear Sir Sidney,' &s;aid Lady Roebuck, 'I
own I am not &s;orry for this opportunity of &s;aying what I think is Emma's
opinion of Mr. Glo&s;s; on the contrary, I &s;hall take the liberty of
follow|ing it with my own.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Emma thinks Mr. Glo&s;s a man of great talents,
but having di&s;covered in him a &s;pecious plau&s;i|bility, which &s;he &s;ays
men of independant cir|cum&s;tances or principles are never under the
ne|ce&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to, &s;he will in&s;i&s;t upon it he is not
an eligible match for Annette.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There is a my&s;tery, an ob&s;curity, in the
very be&s;t accounts we have learnt concerning him, that leaves his qualities
with Emma in a very negative &s;ituation, and inclines her to think he will,
one day or other, be found an impo&s;tor. It has been urged that your
corre&s;pondent at Madeira gives him the character of an able man of
bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ays he was a merchant fir&s;t at Li&s;bon, and afterwards at
Madeira, and that he profu&s;ely &s;pent a large fortune. He him&s;elf &s;ince
&s;ays he received a hand&s;ome &s;um on account of his father's affairs, and
that a much larger remains unpaid, but that India matters are &s;low and
in&s;ecure. But Emma oppo&s;es to this quaintly, but &s;martly enough, that
&s;uppo&s;e they were fa&s;t and certain, would <PB N="94" REF="92"> they tell
in his favour again&s;t his mon&s;trous debts? On account of which, &s;he
in&s;inuates, it was well he &s;ecured him&s;elf a &s;eat in parliament. At the
&s;ame time, &s;he does not deny but his external con|duct is perfectly
blamele&s;s, and that he has openly a number of engaging and valuable
qualities; but &s;he &s;u&s;pects that half the&s;e are put on, and accounts
for this &s;u&s;picion under an idea that it is his &s;tudy to render him&s;elf
agreeable by admini&s;|tering to that pa&s;&s;ion he &s;ees mo&s;t predominant
in the per&s;on he would play upon. Thus he knows with you he cannot have a
recommendation like genero&s;ity and benevolence, and in the exerci&s;e of
the&s;e, though but in appearance, he in&s;ures him&s;elf a place in your
e&s;teem. And the&s;e truths, for truths &s;he will have them to be, are the
more &s;trongly rooted in her mind by a firm belief that all we have heard
again&s;t Mr. Hazard originates from him.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Now I grant there is an air of extravagance in
the&s;e conjectures; neverthele&s;s, though chequered by &s;trong predelection,
and being but one con|jecture hazarded againd another, probability is not one
moment neglected. The very be&s;t ac|counts of him call him a man of unbounded
ex|travagance, which &s;urely has clo&s;e relation to profligacy. Then if he is
in debt as much as the <PB N="95" REF="93"> world &s;ays, were he to-morrow out
of parliament, he mu&s;t be totally without fortune: in which ca&s;e would he
be an eligible hu&s;band for An|nette?</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to his accommodating di&s;po&s;ition, which
Emma is &s;o angry at, he will not practice it with much &s;ucce&s;s upon you,
who know the world, or it would be very hard, full as well as Mr. Glo&s;s; and
for the article of his practices again&s;t Mr. Hazard&mdash;which I confe&s;s I
hardly know how not to admit&mdash;it would be an ungentlemanlike advan|tage,
which I am &s;ure you would be the fir&s;t to re&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In &s;hort, Emma thinks him an impo&s;tor, who
will one day or other be found out; and, for my own part, I wi&s;h his

<P>Sir Sidney having heard his good lady to an end, thanked her for
her very kind, &s;en&s;ible, mild, and con&s;iderate &s;peech, which he &s;aid
had nothing new or uncommon in it from her, but was only one of tho&s;e
innumerable in&s;tances which he had received of the &s;weet benevolence of her
gentle nature. It <PB N="96" REF="94"> &s;eemed however to demand &s;omething
on his part, and he &s;hould an&s;wer it, he hoped, perfectly to the
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He began by admitting that Mr. Glo&s;s's account of him&s;elf,
at fir&s;t &s;ight, was equivocal; but, how|ever, we mu&s;t not &s;ay a thing
is fal&s;e becau&s;e we could not prove it true. Mr. Glo&s;s's father ap|peared
to be an ob&s;cure character, but there was nothing new in that among people
who made for|tunes in India. The young gentleman had certainly been
extravagant; he had now however retrenched, and lived within bounds. That there
was to be &s;ure &s;omething in the report of his being in debt, for he had
him&s;elf given him a faithful account of it, but the money coming from India
would &s;atisfy all tho&s;e matters, and leave a hand&s;ome &s;urplus. That as
to his good qualities, they were &s;omething more than external: the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given to Ca&s;tle|wick, which was richer, and much more
exten&s;ive, through his advice and exertions, was a proof of it. But he had
other qualities, other talents, which, among liberal men, were paramount to
either birth or fortune, and ranked him pre-eminently among tho&s;e who&s;e
names were tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. He had all that was nece&s;&s;ary to
make a con&s;um|mate &s;tate&s;man, and he had no doubt but the period was not
far di&s;tant when he would be &s;een to adorn <PB N="97" REF="95"> one of the
fir&s;t &s;ituations under government.&mdash;When this &s;hould be the ca&s;e,
no objection could po&s;&s;ibly lie again&s;t him, and he owned he &s;hould
then be &s;orry to hear his daughter refu&s;e him for a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>As to any practices of his again&s;t the reputation of Mr
Hazard, they certainly exi&s;ted only in Mrs. Emma's imagination; for it had
been his uniform practice to defend that unfortunate young gentle|man as long
as truth and rea&s;on would permit him; but when proofs came &s;o thick that a
man mu&s;t be blind not to &s;ee them, he, like every body el&s;e, was obliged
to yield to conviction.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Hazard, every thing he did was ab|&s;urdity and
ill-judged profu&s;ion. He was at that moment engaging in &s;chemes which could
not be effected by men of immen&s;e fortune and immen&s;e influence, and, what
was wor&s;e, under the colour of munificence, the view was profit. In &s;hort,
with a few thou&s;ands, he was in more ways than one new modelling cu&s;toms,
which had been long cor|dially received, and well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that the
con&s;equence of this dream of riches and popularity would be his waking
probably in a few months a <PB N="98" REF="96"> beggar: in which ca&s;e could
he be called an eligi|ble hu&s;band for Annette?</P>
<P>As to the variety of crimes laid to his charge, he would agree
that but one &s;ide had been heard, but who&s;e fault was it? Why did he not,
if his cau&s;e would bear it, defend him&s;elf? Why truly he cho&s;e to take
the matter in dudgeon; to look highly, and feel him&s;elf offended becau&s;e
people cho&s;e to believe what they heard! This might be a good cloak to hide a
weak plea, but did not at all look like innocence, which &s;o far from fearing
in|ve&s;tigation, he &s;aid, always &s;ought it.</P>
<P>Had any thing like this been &s;een in Mr. Ha|zard? So &s;ar
from &s;eeking the &s;malle&s;t explanation, had he not indu&s;triou&s;ly
&s;hunned all &s;uch opportu|nities? Nay, was he not &s;o conceitedly proud,
&s;o ridiculou&s;ly vain, when he had been &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;for to this
moment it was not a certainty&mdash;to have be|haved generou&s;ly, as to reject
with contempt the acknowledgement of this imaginary kindne&s;s? and di&s;claim
the friend&s;hip of the man he would fain be thought to have obliged!</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he &s;aid, the&s;e were his ideas: that, in a
worldly point of view, Mr. Glo&s;s was in|finitely <PB N="99" REF="97"> a
preferable hu&s;band for Annette. His talents were brilliant, he was him&s;elf
very popular, and would mo&s;t probably one day be in a mo&s;t ele|vated
&s;ituation. On the contrary, Mr. Hazard&mdash;who&s;e talents al&s;o were very
con&s;picuous, and who&s;e accompli&s;hments were not inferior to any
man's&mdash;by a perver&s;e pride and fal&s;e con&s;equence, would every day
become lower in the world's opi|nion, till he found him&s;elf &s;tarving with
indepen|dant principles. 
<Q REND="inline">'However,' &s;aid Sir Sidney, 'you have named
your&s;elf the compact, and I &s;ub&s;cribe to it: while I find Annette
obedient, I &s;hall not be unrea&s;onable. In the interim, as I &s;incerely
believe that Mr. Glo&s;s will certainly be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of both honour and
fortune&mdash;more perhaps than I have a right to expect in a
&s;on-in-law&mdash;I de&s;ire he may be con&s;idered in the light of one whom I
have cho&s;en to fill that character.'</Q></P>
<P>This retro&s;pective chapter &s;hews how matters &s;tood in Sir
Sidney's family about the time Charles began to be a projector, from which
moment, to that in which his name appeared in the Gazette, he gradually &s;unk
in the opinion of the baronet; for, through the connivance of the
fore&s;tallers of law and beef, his name was bandied about in the new&s;papers
like a tennis ball; in which inoffen&s;ive <PB N="100" REF="98"> amu&s;ement
Mr. Glo&s;s was not idle; but when the Whereas made its appearance, and the
title of butcher was added to our hero's name, I &s;incerely believe, had there
been no &s;uch man as Mr. Glo&s;s, or indeed no other than Charles, Annette
might have died a virgin, or married without her father's con&s;ent.</P>
<P>As to Emma, &s;he entered into all the &s;pirit of our hero's
&s;chemes with enthu&s;ia&s;m. She declared it folly and ignorance to condemn
them; that the very enemies they begat were the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of their
utility; that they evinced a noblene&s;s of &s;oul beyond all example in &s;o
young a man; and that if Ca&s;tlewick was a mole-hill in the &s;cale of
liberality, Charles's projects were a mountain.</P>
<P>In &s;hort&mdash;and I cannot help thinking with her&mdash;Emma
&s;aw &s;o large, &s;o benificent, &s;o admirable a &s;y&s;tem of general good
in them, that nothing but the envy of individuals, and the degeneracy of the
public could prevent their arriving to that maturity which would perpetuate the
projects and the pro|jector.</P>
<P>Emma greatly feared, however, the &s;ucce&s;s of that &s;cheme
that went to cure the abu&s;es of the law; <PB N="101" REF="99"> 
<Q REND="inline"> 'for well,' &s;aid &s;he, 'did Pope Pius the

<P>I &s;hall now return to Charles, who, that he might under&s;tand
the extent of not only his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, but his expectations, received
the day af|ter he became a free man, an account that his noble brother was
ble&s;t with an heir to his title and e&s;|tate.</P>
<P>As our hero had long accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to look up to no one
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he now &s;aw the ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;itting
down without embarra&s;&s;|ment to con&s;ider in what way he &s;hould make his
talents turn out to his advantag. To do this, he looked his &s;ituation full in
the face, and immedi|ately with a &s;igh of affection and regret, ble&s;t the
remembrance of that provident father, who had &s;eemed to have fore&s;een this
moment, and armed him again&s;t it. His pen had already been cele|brated in the
highe&s;t terms of panegyric. His pen|cil <PB N="103" REF="101"> had procured
him very lavi&s;h encomiums, even from the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing arti&s;ts, and
his talent for mu&s;ic was allowed not to be inferior to either of the others.
He therefore thought it hard if he could not live independantly, when he had
three &s;uch re|&s;ources. At the &s;ame time he knew that to become a public
man he mu&s;t conde&s;cend, and, in order to do &s;o, all former high
prejudices and per&s;pective notions of &s;ituation and opulence mu&s;t be
con|quered; for though the public was a noble and liberal ma&s;ter, yet his
would be at be&s;t a &s;ituation of mental &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>His next idea was how he &s;hould render his abi|ties worthy of
&s;uch an illu&s;trious patronage; and the re&s;ult of this reflection became
naturally a re&s;o|lution to produce works of general utility, &s;uch as would
promote the cau&s;e of genius and literature, and were dear to the intere&s;ts
of virtue and mora|lity.</P>
<P>And now to wean him&s;elf from all vain expecta|tions. His
fir&s;t effort was an adieu to Annette, which would have been poetry but that
there was too much of the heart in it to be dre&s;&s;ed in the garb of fiction.
There was &s;o much pure feeling, in|deed noble &s;elf-denial, and exalted love
in it, that it took but a few minutes to write it. The angui&s;h 
<PB N="104" REF="102"> of that &s;hort time could &s;carcely be repaid by an
age of happine&s;s. It was like tearing the vitals, and Emma, when &s;he read
it, declared that the agony of the young Spartan was nothing to it; for the
reader &s;ees the difficulty was to bear the tor|ment, yet give the
con&s;olation. This was the letter:

<P> THIS letter, be&s;t of creatures, is &s;upported by the

<P> To induce my admiration of the exce&s;s of your love, and

<P> Ah Charles! have you no other argument to cure me of

</LETTER></P>
<P>The reader may judge what &s;ort of cordial this letter proved
to a lover, who had been alternately &s;hivering with low &s;pirits, or raving
in a fever the whole night. The faithful Mrs. Marlow &s;aw the progre&s;s of
this medicine with tears of gratitude, and our hero, after reading it ten
times, ki&s;&s;ing it five hundred, and imploring all the angels in hea|ven to
ble&s;s and protect &s;o much beauty and good|ne&s;s, mu&s;tered up &s;pirits
enough to turn his mind again towards his affairs.</P>
<P>Charles had, upon two former occa&s;ions, &s;ent pictures to the
royal academy, as an honorary ex|hibiter. When he attended the dinner, upon St.
Luke's day, he received from the pre&s;ident and &s;e|veral of the members, the
mo&s;t extravagant marks <PB N="108" REF="106"> of applau&s;e. He thought
therefore he could not do a more eligible thing than to begin his &s;cientific
career by &s;ending a couple of pictures to the next exhibition, with a
mode&s;t price affixed to them, by way of adverti&s;ement, that he meant in
future to re&s;ort to painting, among other things, for a main|tenance.</P>
<P>The pictures were accompanied by a re&s;pectful letter to the
pre&s;ident&mdash;who, he doubted not, would do him ju&s;tice&mdash;intreating
to be con&s;idered in future as a common, and not an honourary, exhibiter.</P>
<P>This done, he waited with impatience for the &s;ucce&s;s of his
&s;tratagem. The exhibition was ad|adverti&s;ed, our hero received his ticket
of admi&s;&s;ion, and repaired to the place, where, for twenty mi|nutes, he
could not find either of his pictures. He tumbled over the catalogue, which
ea&s;ed him of half his fear&mdash;for he had fancied they were both
rejected&mdash;by informing him that one of his perfor|mances was certainly in
&s;ome part of one of the rooms. Vainly however did he &s;earch for a
con&s;i|derable while, till at length, being upon the point of giving the
matter up, elevating his &s;ight, in a nook, clo&s;e to the &s;ky-light, he
fancied he had di&s;|covered the object of his perqui&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107"> The picture however was &s;carcely known
to him, though he had painted it; for one &s;ingle &s;treak of light fell upon
it at the right hand corner at the top, which gleamed towards the centre, where
it re&s;ted in a &s;peck; while a &s;udden &s;hadow, occa|&s;ioned by the
projection of the chimney piece, cut it acro&s;s from the left hand corner at
top to the right hand corner at bottom, forming an angle with one half of the
frame. In &s;hort, it had exactly the effect of a looking gla&s;s, badly
painted, in a cham|ber &s;cene for the theatre, which idea mu&s;t occur to
every reader.</P>
<P>This was not all: Had either of the pictures been &s;een alone,
it could not po&s;&s;ibly have had the &s;malle&s;t effect, for they
appertained to each other like que&s;|tion and an&s;wer. Charles therefore
&s;aw it was an affront, and was more &s;trongly confirmed in this when he
found his other picture to&s;&s;ed about with a hole in it. Upon an application
for redre&s;s, he was told he might take away his daubings, if he di&s;|liked
their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Charles could not conceive how it could happen that
profe&s;&s;ors of a liberal art knew &s;o little of the manners of gentlemen;
but, &s;ince he found it &s;o, he re&s;olved to &s;hew them he could right
him&s;elf, <PB N="110" REF="108"> even with the very tool for which they
&s;eemed &s;o to de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>To effect this, he painted a picture to which was annexed this
explanation.</P>
<P>A &s;overeign prince, in a certain country, had built a palace;
to decorate which various poten|tates contributed many co&s;tly pre&s;ents.
One, a|mong the re&s;t, &s;ent a collection of pictures, all the works of
eminent arti&s;ts. That the&s;e might be di&s;tributed in advantageous
&s;ituations, the prince &s;ent for the heads of the royal academy, to perform
that ta&s;k as their judgment &s;hould direct them.</P>
<P>After fixing &s;everal according to their di&s;tinction, which
indeed gave but little trouble, for they were all, as it appeared, labelled,
they came to one about which they could not find this mark of di&s;tinction,
and therefore, concluding that the picture was of no value, they condemned it
to be placed in the temple of Cloacina.</P>
<P>Our hero's picture repre&s;ented the academecians marching with
the picture, in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, to put the above &s;entence in
execution. The mo&s;t ac|tive among them were tho&s;e with whom he had 
<PB N="111" REF="109"> the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be offended, and the
like|ne&s;&s;es were &s;o &s;trong, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;|take
them. But, to crown the joke, he introduced a portrait of him&s;elf, in the
foreground, holding up the label they had vainly &s;earched for:&mdash;on which
was written GUIDO.</P>
<P>This picture he exhibited in an auction room, hired for the
purpo&s;e; and, for a time, it actually drew away the company from the
exhibition of the arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>He became immediately known, and might have had &s;ome practice
at portrait painting; but, find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to make people hand&s;ome
enough, he forewent this mo&s;t &s;ervile of all mental drudgery, and declared
altogether for pieces of thought and fancy, in which he found his genius more
gratified. The&s;e however nobody under&s;tood, and they re|mained un&s;old. A
picture dealer or two offered to treat for them, provided he would &s;moak
them, and varni&s;h them repeatedly, till they were all over cracks; for, in
that ca&s;e, they would give them new names, and pa&s;s them upon the public:
e&s;|pecially if there were a few holes burnt in the drapery, or an eye poked
out of the principal figure.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="110"> This kind of &s;ervile impo&s;ition,
however, our hero did not chu&s;e to &s;ubmit to, and his pictures went
un&s;old.</P>
<P>Charles had become &s;lightly acquainted with a young arti&s;t,
who appeared very anxious that he &s;hould pu&s;h his fortune, and informed him
there was but one way, which was portrait painting&mdash;Charles told him he
had practi&s;ed it without &s;uc|ce&s;s. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, but you did not go the right way to work,'
an&s;wered the other 'It is not painting a lady's likene&s;s will do: you
under&s;tand me:&mdash;you mu&s;t favour a lady with a living likene&s;s, if
you wi&s;h to do any good. In &s;hort, if the painter be young and
hand&s;ome&mdash;and dam'me if I think either you or I frightful&mdash;a lady
&s;its to him with a view that he &s;hould make love to her! And then &s;uch
opportunities! Plea&s;e my dear ma'am to look at me:&mdash;more full if you

bo&s;om throbs in good earne&s;t, &s;he takes you to her arms, and your labours
become real nature, in&s;tead of imitative.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles laughed heartily at this de&s;cription, and then
re&s;uming a more &s;erious air, a&s;ked if there were any in&s;tances of
the&s;e &s;ort of amours.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed there are,' an&s;wered the other.
'Gen|teel young fellows never need be without them, and it is their own faults
if they do not &s;nap up fortunes. But they are a &s;et of &s;tupid
block|heads, without manner or addre&s;s; and when they conceive an idea of
that &s;ort, they generally come into di&s;grace. It was but the other day a
fooli&s;h brother of the bru&s;h made his declaration too prematurely&mdash;for
you know my dear &s;ir there is a manner, a delicacy in &s;uch
matters&mdash;and was kicked out of the hou&s;e for his pains. Ma&s;ter
Mu&s;quito though was a little too cunning. Ay, he is a dry hand!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mu&s;quito,' &s;aid Charles, 'What
Mu&s;quito?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why you know well enough,' &s;aid the other,'
'Sir Sidney u&s;ed to invite him to his hou&s;e. Don't you know what has
happened to him. Upon &s;e|cond <PB N="114" REF="112"> thoughts it mu&s;t have
happened while you were in France. Only married to a woman of &s;even
thou&s;and a year; that is all. Ay, ay, they may talk of poets writing
them&s;elves into a lady's good graces, or a mu&s;ician tickling their ears,
but I &s;ay the painter is the man to &s;ucceed. He &s;ituates the zones of his

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well I hope you will mind yours,' &s;aid
Charles, 'but this you tell me of Mu&s;quito is a&s;toni&s;hing.'</Q>

<P>WE have &s;een the &s;ame mind in our hero as to revenge ever
&s;ince we fir&s;t noticed him. If he aimed at puni&s;hing others, it was with
a view to general ju&s;tice. Certainly there could not be any thing more
unhand&s;ome than for a &s;et of men, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in their profe&s;&s;ion,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed only for the purpo&s;e of giving novices their countenance

<P>From the moment Charles &s;et out as an arti&s;t, he guarded
again&s;t all con&s;equences, by &s;upplying him&s;elf at his lei&s;ure moments
with materials for forwarding his intere&s;t in every branch he profe&s;&s;ed.
Thus, he had &s;carcely &s;ent his pictures to the ex|hibition, but he
con&s;idered how he might make mu&s;ic turn to account. He could not buckle to
teaching mu&s;ic any more than to portrait painting, for he plainly &s;aw that
none but the packhor&s;es of mu&s;ic &s;tood a chance in this branch. Such as
could exalt claws into a fine finger, find &s;weet tones in a 
<PB N="118" REF="116"> di&s;&s;onant &s;quall, in &s;hort, &s;ubmit to all the
ignorant conceited airs of wire-breaking young Mi&s;&s;es, flatter their
mammas, dandle the younger children upon their knees, deliver written
appointments for a&s;&s;ig|nations, which were &s;ometimes directed to
them|&s;elves, and &s;uch other kind of drudgery as appends to the duty of
the&s;e under &s;ervants, the&s;e &s;crubers and &s;cullions of the
mu&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the theatre, he had gained &s;ome little ex|perience of
that before, and if, in quality of ma&s;ter, he was obliged to retire, what
chance did he &s;tand in quality of &s;ervant?&mdash;for as &s;ervants he well
knew all tho&s;e mu&s;t expect to be treated who wi&s;hed to give their
productions to the public through that medium. Then as to publications, the
country was inundated by Italian and German compo&s;itions, which obtained
patronage through the medium of &s;ome man of di&s;tinction, to who&s;e
plea&s;ures the com|po&s;er admini&s;tered &s;ometimes in a way that an
En|gli&s;hman would &s;tarve rather than &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of a variety of cogitations on this &s;ubject, he
was called on by his old friend Toogood, who had lately put him&s;elf very
forward in the mu|&s;ical world.</P>
<P>This &s;on of Apollo told Charles, that as he un|der&s;tood 
<PB N="119" REF="117"> he had thoughts of devoting him&s;elf to the mu&s;es,
for a livelihood, he &s;hould be happy &s;o &s;erve him in &s;o meritorious a
determination. He flattered him&s;elf, he &s;aid, that as he had got into a
con&s;pi|cuous &s;ituation, by making his profe&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;er|vient to
his intere&s;t, he, of all others, had it mo&s;t in his power to point out the
only way in mu&s;ic to profit and reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. Toogood profe&s;&s;ed a great opinion of our hero's
profe&s;&s;ional abilities, and &s;till more of his good &s;en&s;e and
knowledge of the world, and doubted not, as he had &s;marted &s;everely for his
follies, that he would now take up, and con&s;ider that men's talents were
given to work out their own advan|tage.</P>
<P>Charles, &s;eeing his drift, encouraged him to open his whole
budget, through which he learnt that, from his youth, he had made it a practice
of levying contributions on people of no ta&s;te, by which means he was become
the Apollo, or rather the Orpheus, of the day; that he was looked up to as the
regulater of &s;tyle and leader of fa&s;hion in mu|&s;ic; and all this he laid
open in a plain narrative of his life and principles, without omitting a
&s;ingle circum&s;tance of either his own duplicity, or the credulity of his
patrons.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="118"> Having heard him to an end, this was our
hero's an&s;wer. 
<Q REND="inline">'And &s;o Mr. Toogood, becau&s;e you have all
your life, under the appearance of cringing, trim|ming, and many other
truckling and wretchedly accommodating &s;hifts, vitiated the public ta&s;te,
and &s;candalized a beautiful and u&s;eful art, you would have me copy your
creeping &s;ervility!&mdash;Sir you affront me both as a mu&s;ician and a
gen|tleman, by your unworthy and contemptible pro|po&s;al. It is &s;uch as you
the world has to thank for introducing my&s;tery and difficulty into the
plaine&s;t &s;y&s;tem of rational plea&s;ure the &s;oul of man can receive; for
&s;etting up an inexplicable &s;tan|dard to judge of that which is the
e&s;&s;ence of ea&s;e and &s;implicity. No, Mr. Toogood, I de&s;pi&s;e the
&s;ervility of your mind as much as I reprobate the fallacy of your doctrines;
and, much as I value popular e&s;teem, I &s;hould di&s;dain to accept it
otherwi&s;e than as a tribute to exertions intended to convey rational
plea&s;ure and &s;olid advantage.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles however did nothing by this &s;ort of conduct but invite
enemies. But this did not &s;top him. He really could not bridle his
re&s;ent|ment. To &s;ee men pervert the very end of nature's gifts, and
endeavour to confirm others in error, in&s;tead of leading them out of it,
de&s;erved, he &s;aid, reprobation of the &s;evere&s;t kind, and he was
deter|mined <PB N="121" REF="119"> at lea&s;t to drag &s;uch mon&s;trous
impo&s;tors into open day, and expo&s;e their deformities, after which it would
be the world's fault if &s;uch counterfeit coin was &s;uffered to pa&s;s
current.</P>
<P>Charles had yet done but little in the way of pro|fit. Indeed he
did not &s;ee how he could; for it was &s;o dirty a road, that he had not the
re&s;olution to follow it. It became however nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould
think of &s;omething in good earne&s;t. For this purpo&s;e he completed an
opera, which he had had long in contemplation, and which he had been repeatedly
reque&s;ted by one of the managers to put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to. He
&s;ent it, and as he knew pretty well the trim of this &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s,
his compact was that he would &s;tand or fall by its me|rits, without the
interference of any other per&s;on. This was charming, it would have a
prodigious run, and every attention &s;hould be paid it.</P>
<P>Our hero called on the manager to con&s;ult on the nece&s;&s;ary
&s;teps to bring it before the public. He was &s;till received with great
warmth. He wi&s;hed however he would be advi&s;ed. 
<Q REND="inline">'In what?'</Q> Why &s;uppo&s;e he waited upon
the editors of the different papers, to be&s;peak favour. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why? If it de&s;erved applau&s;e it was to come
from the public, not the <PB N="122" REF="120"> new&s;papers. If it did not,
their purcha&s;ed fa|vour would be a &s;atire on the performance, and an
in&s;ult to the public.'</Q> This was good theory, but not practicable. Charles
&s;aid it &s;hould be prac|ticable in his ca&s;e, or nothing &s;hould. It was
ma|terial to him to come at the truth. If he fal&s;ely flattered him&s;elf, and
had not abilities for what he had undertaken, nothing could be kinder than to
undeceive him. If he had, let his reward come &s;pontaneou&s;ly from tho&s;e
who he was &s;ure would pay it with intere&s;t if it was his due. He &s;poke
charmingly; it was a pity he did not know what &s;tage conduct was. Charles
&s;aid it was a pity the manager did not know what it ought to be. The manager
rallied Charles, and Charles did not &s;pare the manager, who however did not
wi&s;h to lo&s;e the piece, of which he had a great opinion.</P>
<P>After &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary matters were &s;ettled, they parted,
agreeing that the opera, like an act of parliament in a certain &s;tage,
&s;hould be copied for the u&s;e of the members.</P>
<P>Charles that very evening received a &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t
with the manager the next morning. He went, and had he not known his man,
mu&s;t have been a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing him&s;elf treated with a di&s;|tant
coolne&s;s. He had been thinking; &s;ome of the <PB N="123" REF="121">
pa&s;&s;ages did not &s;trike him as at fir&s;t: A friend of his&mdash;. Our
hero gave him, in a few words, to un|der&s;tand that, by agreement, no friends
were to interfere. It was very true, but the expence of a fir&s;t piece was a
large &s;take. Very likely, our hero &s;aid, and if he felt his promi&s;e hang
awkwardly upon him, he was ready to acquit him of it. Oh by no means. Well it
&s;hould be as he plea&s;ed:&mdash;but did not he think a few
alterations&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'Not one,' &s;aid Charles. 'If you &s;ay a word
more about it, I will put the piece in my pocket.'</Q> In &s;hort they parted
but barely civil: the piece was however left.</P>
<P>A few days afterwards they had another meeting. The manager was
all rapture. He begged our hero would not be offended at what was done, but
indeed it was impo&s;&s;ible to be offended. He &s;hould &s;ee.</P>
<P>A new copy of the piece was then produced, with alterations in
the hand writing of four dif|ferent people, whom he knew to be retainers to the
hou&s;e, and were the very men and women&mdash;for this was the fact&mdash;who
at that time kept away tho&s;e real geniuses to whom I have &s;aid Charles
formerly paid vi&s;its of &s;olicitation, and nau&s;eated the town with their
own in&s;ipid tra&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122"> Charles ca&s;t his eyes over the copy
merely to a&s;|certain this fact, and then &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, independant of theatrical bu&s;ine&s;s, I
know no one more a gen|tleman than your&s;elf. Upon theatrical bu&s;ine&s;s I
never knew a man &s;o pitifully mean. Suppo&s;ing it would an&s;wer any good
purpo&s;e in your wi&s;e politics to make a &s;hew of my piece, to invite
whatever dunce thinks proper to come and blot it, do you think &s;ir &s;o
contemptibly of me as to &s;uppo&s;e I will bear it. But, putting that out of
the que&s;tion, can any thing &s;o &s;trongly evince your ignorance both of
theatrical performances and your own intere&s;t? If I &s;ubmitted to the&s;e
alte|rations, would not every individual who made them claim his own feather,
while I mu&s;t quietly &s;tand to be plucked? and, for God's &s;ake, what
feathers are they? Have they made me a bit hand&s;omer? So far from it, that
which was, if not &s;uperb and magnificent, yet neat and decent, is now altered
into a motley fool's jacket. But, &s;ir, you may take the materials and make
them into a cap for your own wear. In &s;hort, I &s;hall tru&s;t to your honour
not to make u&s;e of my ideas to your advantage, and as for any thing el&s;e, I
am your humble &s;ervant.'</Q></P>
<P>The manager however would not let him go. He begged him to
con&s;ider that the &s;cenes were paint|ing, <PB N="125" REF="123"> that he had
engaged a &s;inger at a high &s;a|lary.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do not care for that &s;ir,' &s;aid Charles;
'it is di&s;honourable not to abide by your agreement; you had the evidence of
your &s;en&s;es <HI>prima facie:</HI> you can have no more now. What have they
de|cided? Why truly that the meane&s;t &s;cribbler in your hou&s;e is to give
laws to me. But, as I &s;aid, letting alone that &s;ee-&s;aw, your own
judgment, you have done a thing totally again&s;t your in|tere&s;t; for the&s;e
poor creatures, who&s;e tra&s;h cer|tainly never &s;hall &s;tand a part of the
piece, lo&s;ing the merit of having made the&s;e alterations&mdash;which by
this time they have vaunted to all their friends&mdash;will become enemies both
to the piece and me: &s;o, for your caprice, I am obliged to wage war with a
&s;et of poor reptiles, who have not offended me, and whom I have no more
in|clination to tread upon than any other worms, which, &s;earching for food,
are unlucky enough to come under my feet. In &s;hort, bad as it is, for this
la&s;t time, I will overlook this &s;trange con|duct, &s;ince you talk of
lo&s;&s;es which certainly I do not wi&s;h you to &s;u&s;tain; but I in&s;i&s;t
that every word &s;hall be expunged which I may not ju&s;tly claim as my
own.'</Q> This was at length agreed <PB N="126" REF="124"> to, and a morning
for the fir&s;t rehear&s;al was ap|pointed.</P>
<P>The day came, the words were read, during which &s;ome of the
actors, as they were in&s;tructed, yawned at particular pa&s;&s;ages. The&s;e
were after|wards to be objected again&s;t by the manager, which Charles well
knowing, anticipated, by taking him a&s;ide, and telling him that he &s;aw what
he was aim|ing at, but it would not do, for that every pa&s;&s;age at which the
performers had &s;o ill acted the part of yawners, &s;hould remain without the
&s;malle&s;t alte|ration. He &s;aid, however implicitly the manager might pin
his faith upon the &s;leeve of &s;uch opinions, he would not wi&s;h a better
omen of &s;ucce&s;s than an actors entertaining an indifferent opinion of a
dra|matic entertainment; for that, in general, they were men of very &s;lender
intellects and mean education, who had no opportunity of making worldly
ob&s;er|vation but at the porter hou&s;e, or in the green room, who had now in
tragedy de&s;troyed what was meant for a repre&s;entation of greatne&s;s, by
&s;talking like puppets, and braying like a&s;&s;es, and who had no idea of
comedy otherwi&s;e than by grinning like apes and chattering like parrots.
Be&s;ides, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, poor devils, it was a repetition of the
&s;ame mi&s;erable farce which had &s;o recently been performed by the authors.
They were bid to feel <PB N="127" REF="125"> as the others were. He wondered
therefore that the manager would attempt at treating him &s;o un|worthily, when
he knew how ill &s;uch former illibe|rality had been &s;tomached.</P>
<P>The patentee was certainly nettled enough at this &s;pirited
conduct of our hero. He however thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s what he felt,
and they proceeded to the mu&s;ic-room, where every thing was ready for a
repetition of the mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The moment Charles entered the room, he was &s;urrounded by the
females. 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord, Mr. Hazard, cried one, 'don't you think
this here round o is mon&s;trous frightful? You ought to have given me a &s;ong
full of divi&s;ions, and runs, and &s;hakes, to &s;hew my powers.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Let us hear it played, Mi&s;s Forward,' &s;aid
Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh Lord,' re|plied the lady, 'there is no
occa&s;ion for that, I have played it all over my&s;elf with one finger, and I
tell you it will have no effect.'</Q></P>
<P>She was going on with remarks on her other &s;ongs, but Charles
turned from her. He was however as badly off, for he found the principal
&s;inger in high words with the manager, becau&s;e the puppy of a compo&s;er
had truly thought proper to re&s;trict her in her cadences. What did he mean by
&s;uch in&s;o|lence? <PB N="128" REF="126"> Had any body ever attempted to
point out to a mi&s;tre&s;s of her profe&s;&s;ion any limits to her
candenza?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know madam,' &s;aid Charles, 'that it is
al|mo&s;t as vain an attempt as to pre&s;cribe limits to her impertinence; but,
in one word, tho&s;e who &s;ing for me &s;hall &s;ing what I have written, and
nothing el&s;e. It is my mu&s;ic, and not yours, I chu&s;e madam to give to the
world; and, to tell you the truth, what little abilities I have &s;hall be
exerted to explode the candenza which has lately obtained to the &s;candal of
ta&s;te, and the total ex|clu&s;ion of every characteri&s;tic by which mu&s;ic
ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. As it is, &s;inging is be|come a vehicle to
convey every thing that is ex|traordinary, and nothing that is plea&s;ing.
Na|ture, feeling, expre&s;&s;ion, and, above all, a con|veyance of the poet's
ideas&mdash;beyond which every thing in vocal mu&s;ic is impertinence&mdash;all
the&s;e are di&s;regarded. The lady who &s;ings highe&s;t, lowe&s;t, longe&s;t,
and loude&s;t is the be&s;t &s;inger; and thus all you principal performers
&s;tand &s;quall|ing and &s;tretching out your necks like the crow in the
fable, forgetful of the fox underneath, who not only laughs at your folly, but
&s;tands ready to &s;nap up the chee&s;e, the moment it falls out of your
mouths.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="127"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' &s;aid the lady, 'but we take care not to
let it fall out of our mouths. No, no, there is no fear of our getting
chee&s;e, when you poets cannot get bread.'</Q></P>
<P>This wittici&s;m was echoed by a loud ha, ha! throughout the
whole room; after which, an un|der&s;trapper coming up familiarly to Charles,
cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I &s;ay, they gives it you home brother
Bruin: but never mind it: this is nothing at all when you are u&s;ed to
it.'</Q></P>
<P> Charles, turning to the manager, who al&s;o heard this, &s;aid,

<Q REND="inline">'you are very kind, and no doubt find it much to
your intere&s;t to tolerate this: for, were not that the ca&s;e, this fellow
would not dare to add &s;o much impudence to his ignorance.'</Q></P>
<P>The manager made &s;ome trifling apology, &s;miled a &s;neer,
and de&s;ired the repetition might begin.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;ongs were now performed, to every one of which
its re&s;pective &s;inger was &s;uffered to make &s;ome ignorant objection. At
length they came to a &s;ort of bravura &s;ong, in the mid&s;t of which the
leader of the band laid down his fiddle, with an exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh my Gad, my Gad! I vome play dis.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What is the matter now?' <PB N="130" REF="128">
&s;aid the manager.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' cried the enraged fiddler, 'it is no
good, no raight, no arminny.'</Q> He then proceeded to a &s;tring of
rea&s;oning, which, as it was unintelligible to every hearer, &s;o it mu&s;t be
of cour&s;e to every reader.</P>
<P> He had &s;carce done this when Charles &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'and pray &s;ir how long have all the laws of

<Q REND="inline">'Plea&s;e &s;ir to give orders that the

fi|ni&s;hed with no further interruption worth men|tioning.</P>
<P> As &s;oon as it was over, Charles &s;aid to the ma|nager 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir, I mu&s;t beg, before your people leave 
<PB N="131" REF="129"> the room, that they may hear my declaration to you. With
great earne&s;tne&s;s you invited me to this ta&s;k; you took ample time to
deliberate on the merits of what I produced you; and we had &s;ettled a
convention that I am convinced would have been a mutual convenience to us. It
was the duty of your people, according to my conception, to receive their
in&s;tructions, and implicitly to ob|&s;erve them. For my part; had any
per&s;on repre|&s;ented to me, in rea&s;onable language, that any particular
alteration was nece&s;&s;ary either for his or her convenience, or the
advantage of the piece, I &s;hould with willing plea&s;ure have paid &s;uch
ob|&s;ervations every attention they could po&s;&s;ibly me|rit; but, &s;ir,
evidently by your connivance, I have &s;u&s;tained affronts from many of your
people, who, poor wretches, mean me no ill-will, by doing that which your
frequent permi&s;&s;ion has &s;tampt into a duty. Your drift then appears to
lower me to the abject, contemptible humiliation of tho&s;e authors and
mu&s;icians, who depend on you, and who admini&s;tering to your ignorance and
caprice, in&s;ult the public with non&s;en&s;e and barbari&s;m, to the
di&s;grace of letters, and the total perver&s;ion of &s;cience. Keep the&s;e at
your beck and call and welcome, but let me warn you not to expect again that
you can with impunity make a tool of any man who has ground to think 
<PB N="132" REF="130"> worthily of himfelf, and virtue enough to be
in|dependant, le&s;t an expo&s;ition of your arcana rou&s;e the offended public
to &s;upport the cau&s;e of in|jured merit, and oblige you to re&s;tore tho&s;e

<P>So &s;aying, he walked out of the hou&s;e, no one attempting to
interfere; for the performers looked on one another in a&s;toni&s;hment, to
&s;ee an author who refu&s;ed to be a foot ball, and the manager, who &s;aw it

<P><PB N="135" REF="133"> The piece was not &s;ent, and it was with
&s;ome difficulty he got it back again, two months after|wards. Thus ended his
connection with the the|atre.</P>
<P>Our hero's next effort was among the book&s;ellers. Many offers
were made him to work by the &s;heet, but the&s;e he rejected with contempt; at
which he was given to under&s;tand that haughty demeanour would totally
de&s;troy all his expectations; for though to work for the theatre might be
very humiliating, to work for the trade would be &s;till more &s;o.&mdash;Could
he &s;ubmit to e&s;timate his work as they &s;ell poetry to the chandlers
&s;hops, by weight? Could he watch publications as they fell in, and became
univer&s;al property, mutilate them, and make an unconnected jumble out of
them, under the title of 'Beauties of an eminent Poet?' Could he take the old
magazines and new&s;papers, and make out of them a new periodical publication?
Had he a knack of critici&s;ing authors that never exi&s;ted?&mdash;Was he
expert, without plan or nece&s;&s;ity, at poetic ribaldry, which dealt about
the faeces of &s;atire again&s;t all ranks and di&s;tinctions, without either
its truth, its elegance, or its point?&mdash;and e&s;pecially again&s;t that
high character who&s;e heart is the &s;eat of goodne&s;s and mercy, who&s;e
private worth is the criterion of dome&s;tic virtue, and who&s;e public
ex|cellence <PB N="136" REF="134"> is not more di&s;tingui&s;hable by the
&s;plendour of his &s;ituation, than by the gracious beneficence with which he
adorns it.</P>
<P>Could he feign epitaphs? Anticipate parliament &s;peeches? Make
men of abilities write non&s;en&s;ical odes?&mdash;or invent dull good things,
&s;poken by a dead doctor? Could he one day pull down the fa|brick of the
con&s;titution, and the next build it up again?</P>
<P>If he could not do any of the&s;e, he had better be hackney
writer to an attorney, clerk to a lottery office, or any thing than an author.
Where was the u&s;e of any thing new? Had not every thing that can be &s;aid on
all po&s;&s;ible &s;ubjects been ex|hau&s;ted time out of mind? Was there a
&s;ingle idea that, at this time of day, could be put in a new point of view?
How many hi&s;tories of England were there? How many hi&s;tories of other
coun|tries? How many general hi&s;tories? And yet could any body &s;ay which
&s;hould be credited? No, no, the my&s;tery of writing was now at an end; the
whole bu&s;ine&s;s was compiling; and it was the ex|treme of arrogance in any
per&s;on to expect payment but as a compiler. In &s;hort, if he would quietly
put on his apron and &s;leeves, take the &s;ci&s;&s;ors, the wa|&s;ers, and the
pa&s;te pot, come contentedly into the <PB N="137" REF="135"> garret, and
&s;ell his labour for as much as it was worth, he might get pretty bread
enough; but if not, he had better take a pickaxe or a beetle, and dig graves or
thump the pavement.</P>
<P>This was the &s;um of his reception with &s;everal to whom he
applied. At length however he thought he had nicked the very chance that would
make his fortune. He was recommended to a book&s;eller of the name of Alley,
who he was informed dealt largely and liberally. To him he went, and very
candidly told him that, as he had the reputation of a man of worth, an
exten&s;ive publi&s;her, and a libe|ral dealer, he &s;hould be glad to treat
with him for &s;ome things he had by him.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' replied Alley, 'Mr. Hazard, I &s;hall
&s;ay in an&s;wer to this here propo&s;ial, that I am a man of fortune, and I
&s;pends what I gets freely: ben't afraid dam'me of a few &s;hiners: and when I
&s;ees a work that's a work of merit, I deals upon the nail, and as a gentleman
&s;hould. Here, harkee in the &s;hop there. Did the lady in her chariot call
this morning?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No! dam'me you always &s;ay no. But my lord did
though, or el&s;e Sir Peter. In &s;hort &s;ir&mdash;I &s;ay, one of my people,
bring me the keys of the warehou&s;e. Stop now&mdash;look <PB N="138" REF="136"> at this drawer: full, chuck full&mdash;all novels&mdash;I &s;upply
every library in the kingdom. Going to bring out a fire, new, novel edition of
Thomas Hickathrift, for &s;chools. Oh the keys, you &s;hall &s;ee my
warehou&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aying, he lugged our hero into another &s;treet, where he
introduced him to an immen&s;e number of publications, in &s;heets. 
<Q REND="inline">'There,' &s;aid he, 'did you ever &s;ee any
thing like this? Here is a grand edition of Mother Goo&s;e's Tales, purceeded
with a wooden frontispiece, for the Chri&s;tmas holidays; all titivated up, out
of other things, by gradivates from the two univer&s;es of Oxford and
Cambridge. I pays them well; one has had &s;eventeen and &s;ixpence before
hand. Yes, yes, every body knows my genero&s;ity: but then its a damned fine
thing to be charitable.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus he ran over all the rooms in the hou&s;e, pointing out,
upon every &s;helf, &s;ome new book of equal importance with tho&s;e already
mentioned, till at length he convinced our hero he was conceited, ignorant, and
pur&s;e proud, and alike a &s;tranger to ta&s;te and liberality.</P>
<P>Charles, &s;eeing this, determined to cut the matter &s;hort. 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray,' &s;aid he, 'Mr. Alley, do you read 
<PB N="139" REF="137"> all the&s;e things before they come out?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Read!' &s;aid the other, 'I read! Dam'me, you
think that I can read! No, no, I got other gue&s;s work to mind I can tell you.
My gradivates, and my par|&s;ons, and them there fellows read. No, no, I can't
do every thing. I can only &s;ay if you'll fa|vour me with any of your works in
the novel way&mdash;novels you &s;ee are my forte&mdash;they &s;hall be read,
and, if they meet approbation, money, dam'me money is no object. In &s;hort, as
I &s;ay in my adverti&s;ement, to &s;uch ladies and gentle|men as favour me
with their manu&s;cripts, that I flatter, &s;upported by their patronage, to
render in future what has been e&s;teemed frivile, of &s;tand|ing merit,
entertainment, and general improve|ment.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'There's epitaphs for you!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'They are very extraordinary epithets indeed,'
&s;aid Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, epithets,' returned Alley, 'you are
right: dam'me my head is always a wool ga|thering. Well &s;ir, &s;hall I be
favoured with your manu&s;cript?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why &s;ir,' &s;aid Charles, 'I will be very
plain with you. I have a thing &s;omething in the &s;tyle of a novel, which I
will &s;end you. It will make two &s;mall duodecimo volumes.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay twelves, I under&s;tand you,' returned the
book&s;eller, 'that's right, I like twelves.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But I premi&s;e,' added <PB N="140" REF="138">
our hero, 'that if your graduates find any merit in them, I expect to receive a
hand&s;ome gratuity for my labours.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That's enough,' &s;aid Alley, '&s;end them; we
&s;han't di&s;agree.'</Q></P>
<P>They parted: Charles &s;ent his book, and, after repeated
attempts to get it back again, or an an&s;wer to his terms, he at length
received the following letter. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ. THESE PRESENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I received yours, and I am &s;orry my ab|&s;ence, being out
of town, deprived my an&s;wer.</P>
<P> Your book, unfortunably, does not meet ap|probation; as
&s;uch, is returned. You may &s;end for it to my hou&s;e, in Leadenhead-Lane,
when convenient; only plea&s;e to &s;ay which it is, as I have &s;o many,
otherwi&s;e you may not get the right.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, in great ha&s;te, Your very humble &s;ervant,
WILLIAM ALLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="139"> This letter, as well it might, gave our
hero a &s;urfeit of book&s;ellers. Heavens! how he pitied Mr. Alley's par&s;ons
and graduates. It was a &s;en|&s;ible &s;atire upon an enlightened age. But was
there really no trace of that liberality among book&s;ellers which formerly
characteri&s;ed them? How freely had hundreds, nay thou&s;ands, been paid for
books; and &s;urely books were then bought with as much avidity as formerly. He
would try again: it was to no purpo&s;e: and yet he knew not why. His former
publications had &s;old rapidly. The differ|ence was they were written for
amu&s;ement: he now wrote for bread.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he was determined to have re|cour&s;e to his
old friend Ego, who, to eke out his poetry, enjoyed the comfortable
con&s;olation of a &s;nug annuity.</P>
<P> Ego was very glad to &s;ee Charles, and &s;aid, after &s;haking
him heartily by the hand, 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, I am the man to come to for advice. Who
have you ap|plied to?'</Q> Charles told him to all the book&s;ellers without
effect. 
<Q REND="inline">'Dam'me, that's a &s;hame,' cried Ego; 'if I
were a book&s;eller, I would treat au|thors with &s;uch liberality!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But as you are not, Mr. Ego,' &s;aid Charles,
'what would you ad|vi&s;e me to do?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith I don't know,' &s;aid Ego, 
<PB N="142" REF="140"> 'every body is neglected: would you think now a man of
my merit would lay dormant as I do?&mdash;Stay, zounds let me think&mdash;I am
the man for ex|pedients. Have you any money left?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not much I a&s;&s;ure you,' &s;aid Charles.</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'Well, well, &s;aid Ego, it mu&s;t be rai&s;ed.
I have it: I am the man to &s;erve my friends: it will make your for|tune
better than bailiff's bu&s;ine&s;s. Lord, Mr. Hazard, how could you think of
being a merci|ful bailiff! If I were a bailiff, I would be the cruele&s;t
ra&s;cal that ever exi&s;ted.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And, in that ca&s;e,' &s;aid Charles, 'you
would be more in cha|racter than I was; but what is your expedient?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will tell you,' &s;aid Ego: 'you will laugh:
I am the man for making people laugh: I would have a new new&s;paper. There is
a plan!'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A very good one,' &s;aid Charles, 'if a man had
a thou|&s;and pounds to &s;pare, and could &s;tand in the con|cern without
partners.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' &s;aid Ego, 'but people mu&s;t not,
now a-days, &s;tand upon niceties. Do you know any thing of editing? I am the
man for an editor: I would have my pa|per full of good e&s;&s;ays: I would
&s;tick to my party: I would maintain tooth and nail the principles of that
&s;ide I decidedly took. If it was the mini&s;|terial &s;ide, I would not, like
&s;ome papers I could name, creep, and cringe, and be ful&s;ome. I would
chu&s;e that part of their mea&s;ures that could <PB N="143" REF="141"> be
deduced from meritorious motives; for all conduct has its favourable &s;ides.
In &s;hort, there is nothing but may be repre&s;ented upon &s;ome principle or
other apparently worthy, without the wretched nece&s;&s;ity of having
recour&s;e to &s;patter and vilify others. On the contrary, if I decidedly took
up the part of oppo&s;ition, I would expatiate on the noble pa&s;&s;ion of
patrioti&s;m, and let the ge|nerous di&s;intere&s;ted dictates of that glorious
in|ducement tell generally again&s;t mini&s;ters, with|out handing up their
names to the public, and call upon my countrymen to execrate them in the
lump.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nobly di&s;tingui&s;hed,' &s;aid Charles, 'but
in my opinion, Mr. Ego, you are yet wide of the mark. Why take a decided part
at all, unle&s;s indeed the part of truth. What do you think of a paper that
&s;hould watch the impo&s;itions of all the re&s;t; ex|po&s;e them to public
view; detect all their mi&s;re|pre&s;entations; &s;trip them alike of adulation
to mini&s;ters, and factious cavilling again&s;t them; expo&s;e the &s;ource
from whence the corruption flows which poi&s;ons public peace?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds, the very thing in the world,' cried
Ego; 'and &s;o not &s;pare one's very brother, hey, as a body may &s;ay, if he
de&s;erved to be treated &s;everely; and, on the other &s;ide, &s;hower down
encomiums upon the <PB N="144" REF="142"> virtue of one's bittere&s;t
enemies?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Exactly my idea,' cried Charles.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds, give me your hand,' cried Ego. 'Why
don't you thank me for thinking of it? Well I do think I have the rea|die&s;t
brain. En't I the man for a &s;cheme?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' &s;aid Charles, 'and I am the man for
improving upon it. For my part, I like it &s;o well, that if you will
breakfa&s;t with me to-morrow morning, and con&s;ider the matter between this
and then, perhaps we may con&s;olidate &s;omething that will be of mutual
advantage.'</Q></P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="143">
<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONSISTING OF TEMPORIZING.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE reader will think it a little &s;trange that Charles, who
had di&s;dained to &s;ue to Sir Sidney, &s;hould now &s;eek out Ego, who, he
had been in|formed, was one of tho&s;e who did him ill offices with that very
gentleman. The fact is, that in the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent human heart there is
a &s;ort of alloy, a kind of in&s;tability, which indeed, if it had not, our
being would imply a perfectne&s;s which it is univer&s;ally allowed does not
fall to the lot of tho&s;e bipeds called human beings.</P>
<P>Charles then raged with love more violently than ever:&mdash;for
I would not have my readers think that becau&s;e I do not take up their whole
time in expa|tiating upon his amorous vagaries, that he is only in love by fits
and &s;tarts, and at tho&s;e times when I find it nece&s;&s;ary to treat upon
that &s;ubject, by way of varying others. On the contrary, I de&s;ire it may be
under&s;tood that, let him appear how he <PB N="146" REF="144"> may, he never
cea&s;es to be in love with Annette, &s;leeping or waking&mdash;which indeed,
were it nece&s;|&s;ary, I could &s;hew under his hand, both in poetry and
pro&s;e&mdash;for one &s;ingle minute, from the bu&s;ine&s;s of Aix la Chapelle
to the end of his life: nay, were I to antidate the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;tart
from the &s;um|mer before he went to France, I dare &s;ay he might then boa&s;t
as large a portion of that pa&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t, as many who have declared,
ay, and &s;worn to it, that they were dying with it.</P>
<P>Oh this love! What will it not do? But I be|lieve I may as well
leave rhap&s;ody to tho&s;e who have no nece&s;&s;ity to attend to narrative,
and in&s;tead of &s;aying what it will do, content my&s;elf with re|cording
what it did.</P>
<P>I have mentioned our hero's detention of Mrs. Marlow, and his
motive for it, which I remember I had the good fortune to find perfectly
approved by the reader; for I &s;aw him, in my mind's eye, &s;mile as he read
the circum&s;tance. Indeed Charles's partiality to her was &s;uch that, after
what has hap|pened, it is almo&s;t a wonder his enemies had not by this time
made a handle of it to his di&s;advan|tage; for, to &s;ay truth, while other
young men of his age and complexion were &s;acrificing to Bacchus and
Venus&mdash;let it be ob&s;erved I do not mean A&s;|tarte&mdash;&s;couring 
<PB N="147" REF="145"> the &s;treets, and getting into broil, our
&s;piritle&s;s youth pored over a book, made a drawing, or &s;et a &s;onnet:
all which amu&s;ements were only interrupted by the harmle&s;s prattle of an
old woman. Indeed he has often declared that he never pa&s;&s;ed moments of
more &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ure than the&s;e with Mrs. Marlow.</P>
<P>To &s;hew however that &s;elf can never be out of the que&s;tion
with us, the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation was nine-tenths of the
inducement. Charles had now heard nothing of Annette for &s;everal months, and,
in all that time, his love had nothing to feed on but the letter in&s;erted in
the fourth chapter of this book. The more di&s;tant his pro&s;pects were of an
union with the idol of his &s;oul, the more violent was his pa&s;&s;ion; for
this again is the nature of love. Nothing &s;eems to be impo&s;&s;ible to it in
theory, yet in practice it does not work miracles. He knew the &s;oul of
Annette; he knew her incapable of change; he knew, if cruel fortune ravi&s;hed
her hand, nothing could di&s;po&s;e of her heart: She had given it him: it was
his; indi&s;&s;olubly his. Then was there ever &s;uch a prodigy of fidelity and
zeal as Emma? No; he was &s;ecure. He could not more firmly rely on his own
re&s;olution than theirs. No attachment was ever &s;o &s;ure, &s;o grounded,
&s;o permanent. What had he then to fear? Nothing <PB N="148" REF="146"> from
love, but every thing from fortune. Sir Sid|ney was more likely to be
implacable now he was rich, than when he was poor.</P>
<P>All this ground did he and Mrs. Marlow go over every evening of
their lives. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;he would repre&s;ent to him that
indeed he was not the kind of man to live in this world; that it would not do
upon all occa&s;ions to let the unqualified truth appear; that now a-days
people did not open their hearts every time they opened their mouths; and &s;he
could plainly &s;hew that all his mi&s;carriages had been owing to
ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and hone&s;ty, which, as he would never find it in the
dealings of other men, &s;o he might lay his account to its injuring him in all
his concerns. She &s;aid he loved the truth, and &s;he knew he would thank her
for &s;peaking it, and &s;he would therefore tell him that &s;he took the
liberty to di&s;approve his conduct in relation to Mr. Too|good. He had
him&s;elf, it was true, &s;hamefully abu&s;ed tho&s;e talents which he really
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had made them &s;candalou&s;ly &s;ub&s;ervient to his
in|tere&s;t; but if the world cho&s;e to be &s;o impo&s;ed on, was any one
equal to the Herculean ta&s;k of remov|ing its prejudices. Mr. Toogood was in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very comfortable independency. This alone, in the
opinion of the world, would counteract all that could be &s;aid again&s;t him;
and this being the <PB N="149" REF="147"> ca&s;e, &s;he did not wonder that his
conduct, worthy as it was, had been looked upon by one half of the world as
envy, and by the other as illnature. In &s;hort, Mr. Toogood, &s;he &s;aid, had
it in his power to have &s;erved him, and it depended on him&s;elf whether he
was to make an unworthy u&s;e of ad|vantages &s;o procured.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame ground, if he had paid a vi&s;it to Mu&s;quito,
and given a little into his humour, he would doubtle&s;s have intere&s;ted
him&s;elf with the academicians, and, as he was now a man of very great
con&s;equence, there could not be a doubt but it would have turned out a matter
of profit to him.</P>
<P>As to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre, it was certainly too
humiliating, and therefore he could not, in that in&s;tance, be too much
commended. But, in &s;hort, if he cho&s;e to get his bread by his talents, it
mu&s;t be in the way others did it: there was no al|ternative: and &s;he had no
doubt, if he would &s;eri|ou&s;ly lay him&s;elf out for eligible employ, but he
might yet acquire a fortune &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy Sir Sidney, who, &s;he
was &s;ure, would con&s;ider every guinea that was earned as twenty.</P>
<P>Convinced by the&s;e &s;ort of arguments, our hero, 
<PB N="150" REF="148"> as we have &s;een, lo&s;t no opportunity of trying his
ut|mo&s;t to get forward; and, having taken a great deal of trouble with the
book&s;ellers to no purpo&s;e, he and Mrs. Marlow were one evening turning all
matters &s;eriou&s;ly in their minds, when &s;he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear &s;ir, it is wonderful to me you have
never thought of getting about &s;ome real friend of Sir Sidney, and making him
your confidant. If it did nothing el&s;e, you would know from a channel of that
&s;ort what were his private &s;entiments of you, and, among other matters, it
would furni&s;h you with &s;ome particulars relative to Mi&s;s
Roe|buck.'</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t con&s;ideration bore down every other, and Mr.
Balance was thought by both the propere&s;t man in the world for this
purpo&s;e. He was how|ever at that time out of town. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' &s;aid Charles, 'a thought has &s;truck
me, and it will convince you that I mean in future not to quarrel with people
quite &s;o much for their vices. What do you think of Ego? I have told you all
his particularities, and really he has not very much pro&s;tituted his talents:
perhaps indeed becau&s;e he has but few to pro&s;titute; for the pen&s;ion he
has was given him more from o&s;tentation in the donor, than through any
&s;ervility in him&s;elf. Indeed he has too good an opinion of him&s;elf to be
very &s;olici|tous; <PB N="151" REF="149"> for he takes as much care as he can
that, in all his affairs, Ego &s;hould be the fir&s;t per&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is charming,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, and I
will warrant &s;omething comes of it; for, as he loves tittle tattle, he knows
of cour&s;e all Sir Sid|ney's family affairs, and it &s;hall go hard but I will
worm &s;ome of them out of him: and &s;o you &s;ee, without a&s;king a &s;ingle
que&s;tion I &s;hall get at every intelligence you wi&s;h to receive.</Q></P>
<P>It was then agreed that Ego &s;hould be &s;ounded; but it was to
appear that our hero knew nothing of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Thus was the fir&s;t
duplicity he ever practi&s;ed occa&s;ioned by love. Indeed he could not live
any longer in this &s;tate of uncertainty; and if this method had not been hit
upon for the pre&s;ent relief of his anxiety, he certainly would have been put
upon playing &s;ome mad prank or other, which might have induced
conce&s;&s;ions on his &s;ide, for which he never would have forgiven
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the other hand this bu&s;ine&s;s was a lucky hit for Mrs.
Marlow, who, ju&s;t at that time, was upon the point of forging &s;ome &s;ort
of intelligence, to &s;often the edge of our hero's unhappine&s;s. It was now
however unnece&s;&s;ary; for as Charles was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to know what
pa&s;&s;ed between her <PB N="152" REF="150"> and Ego, &s;o there would be no
occa&s;ion to relate more of their conver&s;ation than &s;uch parts of it as
would relieve his fears, which again, if they were not &s;trong enough, might
admit of a little heighten|ing; whereas, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;ink whatever
would be likely to augment his chagrin: for &s;he was not one of tho&s;e
friends who unnece&s;&s;arily aggravated matters, but, on the contrary,
admitted that a little laudable deceit was pardonable, when the propo&s;ed end
was meritorious.</P>
<P>Many good purpo&s;es, Mrs. Marlow flattered her&s;elf, would
derive from this commerce. Ego, &s;he had no doubt, would retail what
pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of Emma, who&s;e wit and ingenuity would not fail
to take hold of &s;uch an occa&s;ion to &s;upply Charles with every thing he
wi&s;hed to know, even, probably, without the con&s;cious concurrence of Ego;
for it might be conveyed in &s;uch ambiguous terms as none but the lovers
them&s;elves could un|riddle; and, come what come might, &s;he re&s;olved to
invent con&s;olation, where it really did not pre&s;ent it&s;elf, for &s;he
could not bear the idea that our hero &s;hould be &s;o afflicted.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time his ob&s;tinacy towards opening a
negociation with Sir Sidney &s;eemed to give way. She hoped in time he would be
wholly <PB N="153" REF="151"> &s;ubdued, and had no doubt when her
well-inten|tioned &s;cheme came to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Balance,
that a perfect reconciliation would take place between them; and then, as it
was in the power of Sir Sidney alone to place our hero in a very con&s;picuous
profe&s;&s;ional light&mdash;which this fooli&s;h woman thought even more
eligible than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an inherited fortune&mdash;&s;he
contemplated, even with tears of joy, that moment when &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him
happy, equal to his de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Big with this project and the&s;e hopes, Mrs. Mar|low waited
with impatience for the morning, and that &s;he might employ her time to as
much advan|tage as po&s;&s;ible, entreated Charles to leave her for half an
hour with Ego, before he came down to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Ego came very punctually to his time. He was &s;hewn in by
Mrs. Marlow, who told him &s;he was very &s;orry, but Mr. Hazard was a little
indi&s;|po&s;ed, and therefore &s;he had not di&s;turbed him; but, however, he
&s;hould be immediately called.&mdash;To which Mr. Ego made an&s;wer, 
<Q REND="inline">'Ah, up late la&s;t night I &s;uppo&s;e: this is
the con&s;equence: ah the&s;e young men! If I was a young man I would be the
mirror of &s;obriety.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="152"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'you would be
ex|actly like Mr. Hazard, for I never &s;aw him other|wi&s;e than &s;ober in my
life.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Indeed!' &s;aid Ego, 'I am glad on't: it is
very commendable. Always &s;ober! Quite an altered man I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ince he
came from France. It is a lamentable thing that young men cannot make the tour
of Europe without getting into &s;o many &s;crapes. If I was to make the
tour&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'he only made the
tour of France, which I do not believe either you or any body el&s;e could have
done to better pur|po&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There, my good lady, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me,'
cried Ego; 'the whole world rings of his &s;hocking doings there. Why don't you
know he robbed a banker, knocked down his brother, &s;tole a nun, &s;pent her
fortune, turned &s;harper, killed a man, and then made his e&s;cape out of
pri&s;on?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No indeed I do not, nor does any body el&s;e,'
&s;aid Mrs. Marlow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay but zounds madam,' returned Ego, 'you
mu&s;t excu&s;e me there: I am the man for knowing the truth of things.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are not the man for knowing the truth of
this,' <PB N="155" REF="153"> &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'for every word of it is
fal&s;e; and I dare &s;ay by fal&s;e reports like the&s;e, which Mr. Hazard has
too much pride to contradict, Sir Sidney's ear has been abu&s;ed, and he has
lo&s;t that good gentleman's confidence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith,' &s;aid Ego, 'like enough, 'for there is
nothing like ab&s;ence for injuring people in the opinion of their friends.
Yes, yes, I &s;ee how the thing has been: I am the man for &s;eeing how the cat
wags her tail. And &s;o it was all lies ha!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Did not you &s;ee it at the time, Mr, Ego?'
&s;aid the good lady, '&s;ince your penetration is &s;o keen.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'See it,' &s;aid Ego, 'Oh yes I&mdash;that is to
&s;ay I had a glimp&s;e, but that damned unmerciful teazer Mu&s;quito, and that
cur&s;ed lamenter of his friend's misfortunes, Toogood, would in&s;i&s;t upon
it in &s;uch terms that you know I was obliged to run a little with the pack;
el&s;e you know what chance had I for a continuance of Sir Sidney's patronage?
Mu&s;t mind the main chance you know, my good lady: I am the man for keeping a
friend,'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That,' cried Mrs. Marlow, 'one may ea&s;ily
&s;ee.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But &s;top a little,' cried Ego, 'Can you
acquit him of this? Did he write one &s;ingle word <PB N="156" REF="154"> to
any individual &s;oul?</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And pray,' an&s;wered Mrs. Marlow, 'was there
no friend had charity enough to allow the po&s;&s;ibility, at lea&s;t, that his
letters had been intercepted; and, if that were the ca&s;e, was it not al&s;o
po&s;&s;ible that he who did him that injury, would not &s;top at
others?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Glo&s;s, Glo&s;s.' cried Ego; 'zounds I &s;ee
it: I am the man for putting the &s;addle on the right hor&s;e. And yet do you
know he had the addre&s;s always to appear Mr. Hazard's friend. But he has
&s;uch a way with him: &s;ure, &s;teady; never brought up the &s;ubject but
when he had made Sir Sidney charmed with him&s;elf, on account of &s;ome act of
genero&s;ity performed by the baronet him&s;elf, or his great grandfather. Yes,
yes, it is plain. He is a devil of a fellow to be &s;ure.&mdash;Why he
bewitches people. Not that his prai&s;e of my poetry was any &s;uch great
matter: common fame does me ju&s;tice: I am the man for poetry: but, the devil
of it is, who is this fellow that makes &s;uch a plaguy noi&s;e in the
world?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'a great man, a
member of parliament.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A mighty great affair indeed,' cried Ego. 'In
your ear, if he was out of parlia|ment he would be in the King's Bench.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'In|deed!' cried Mrs. Marlow, pretending great
a&s;toni&s;hment.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Owes &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds,' 
<PB N="157" REF="155"> continued Ego; 'you may depend upon it from me: I am the
man for knowing how the world wags.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, but if this be the ca&s;e,' cried Mrs.
Marlow, 'how is it po&s;&s;ible that Sir Sidney can be &s;o blinded as to
intend his marriage with Mi&s;s Roebuck?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will tell you how that matter &s;tands,'
&s;aid Ego. 'If the mini&s;try goes out, and they &s;ay it totters at
pre&s;ent&mdash;for you &s;ee I am the man for being a bit of a
politician&mdash;if, do you mind me, they go out, Mr. Glo&s;s will be a made
man, and then he will certainly marry Mi&s;s Roebuck.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'With the young lady's con&s;ent, no doubt,'
&s;aid Mrs. Marlow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not a word of that,' &s;aid Ego: '&s;he will
obey, if you plea&s;e, but never con&s;ent: I am the man for
di&s;tinctions.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What has &s;he any new lover then?' &s;aid Mrs.
Marlow, 'for &s;urely &s;he cannot have kept her&s;elf heart-whole for Mr.
Hazard, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch cea&s;ele&s;s per&s;ecutions, and again&s;t
&s;o many reports to his di&s;advantage.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My good lady,' &s;aid Ego, '&s;uch truth,
&s;uch in|nocence, &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s, &s;uch &s;en&s;e of duty as Mi&s;s
Roebuck po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es I have often read of, and indeed de&s;cribed, ju&s;t
as one de&s;cribes in poetry, &s;ylphs, <PB N="158" REF="156"> gnomes, or
flying dragons; children of fancy, offsprings of the imagination&mdash;I am the
man for a choice of words&mdash;in &s;hort a thing without literal exi&s;tence,
but I confe&s;s I never &s;aw it before.&mdash;Why I have &s;een her receive a
command from Sir Sidney with a &s;mile, while her heart was bur&s;ting. In
&s;hort, &s;he will become a voluntary &s;acrifice to her duty as &s;oon as the
mini&s;try changes.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This then is the arrangement,' cried Mrs.
Marlow, 'and the poor lady and the nation are to turn about together.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Even &s;o,' &s;aid Ego. 'I wi&s;h we could
&s;ay with truth that, in either ca&s;e, turn about would be fair play: I am
the man for a pun.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But pray,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'what part does
Mrs. Emma take?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why that, that,' &s;aid Ego, 'is what I am
ju&s;t now a&s;toni&s;hed at. Until very lately &s;he had been a mo&s;t
&s;trenuous advocate for Mr. Hazard, but I think now we may call her the armed
neutrality. But, upon my word, my good lady, the young gentleman may thank
him|&s;elf if his friends grow cool to him. Can any thing be &s;o mad as the
way he has &s;pent his mo|ney? <PB N="159" REF="157"> What the devil had he to
do with bailiffs, and charity, and beef, and bread? Nobody does it. So you
&s;ee his conduct is a &s;atire upon the world, and now I only a&s;k you, does
any body like to be &s;atirized? I am the man that under|&s;tands propriety.
And then you &s;ee to brag of his actions, and try to depreciate the
benevolence of Sir Sidney, in his favourite &s;cheme of Ca&s;tle|wick!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, has he done that?' &s;aid Mrs.
Marlow.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'It has lo&s;t him the baronet for ever, that's
all,' replied Ego. 'Now I would not have done that: I am the man that never
flies in any body's face.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But I a&s;&s;ure you Mr. Ego,' &s;aid Mrs.
Marlow, 'he had not done this.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What,' &s;aid Ego, 'did not he boa&s;t of
having &s;erved more people in real di&s;tre&s;s in &s;ix months, than ever Sir
Sidney did in all his life?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'I will an&s;wer
for him.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And did not he try to prove, by &s;everal
in&s;tances, that there was no &s;ort of compari&s;on in his charity and that
of the ba|ronet?&mdash;for dam'me, &s;aid he, one day when he was
drunk&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But I tell you he never gets drunk,' &s;aid
Mrs. Marlow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' &s;aid Ego, '&s;ober then: &s;o much the

<P><PB N="160" REF="158"> Here Charles interrupted them. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ha! my good friend Hr. Hazard, I am glad you

<PB REF="159">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH MATTERS SEEM TO DRAW NEARER TO A CRISIS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES having taken an opportunity during breakfa&s;t of going
out of the room, Mrs. Marlow begged Ego not to hint a &s;ingle &s;yllable of
the con|ver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between them. She &s;aid Mr. Hazard was
&s;o tenacious of tho&s;e re&s;olutions he had taken of abiding by the truth of
his inten|tions, without &s;tooping to an explanation with any body, that &s;he
was &s;ure he would break off for ever with any friend who &s;hould be unwi&s;e
enough to &s;tagger his determination; 
<Q REND="inline">'and as I am &s;ure, Mr. Ego,' added &s;he, 'he
has a regard for you, it would be pity you &s;hould lo&s;e one another's
friend|&s;hip in the moment of coming together.'</Q> She hinted al&s;o that
&s;he &s;hould be glad to have &s;ome more private conver&s;ation with him, and
cunningly pretended to wonder what could have cau&s;ed this alteration in Emma?
To which he an&s;wered he would learn the next day, if po&s;&s;ible; for he was
<PB N="162" REF="160"> to dine at Sir Sidney's: and added, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh ble&s;s my heart&mdash;I am the man for
recollection&mdash;Mr. Fig|gins is in town; pray has he called on Mr.
Ha|zard?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I fancy not,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'but
why?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay nothing,' replied Ego, 'only they &s;ay he
has been like the re&s;t of the world&mdash;got it while it was going, hey, you
under&s;tand me: fools and their money&mdash;hey&mdash;I am the man for a
pro|verb.'</Q> And then &s;eeing Charles: 
<Q REND="inline">'but mum's the word: don't be afraid of
me.'</Q></P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t our hero and his friend Ego re|&s;umed the
conver&s;ation of the day before, which they had both duly con&s;idered. Mr.
Ego &s;aid, that as far as his advice or intere&s;t went he was heart and hand
at Charles's &s;ervice, but, as it was both unnece&s;&s;ary to his
circum&s;tances, and improper at his time of life, he begged to be excu&s;ed
from hav|ing any immediate concern in it; 
<Q REND="inline">'for I am the man,' &s;aid he, 'that knows how
to take care of my&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles, who was determined if he did any thing it &s;hould be
&s;olely his own concern, did not di&s;like this declaration, and after &s;ome
further con&s;ul|tation, it was agreed that about eight hundred pounds was
enough to &s;tart the paper: two hun|dred of which our hero could mu&s;ter, and
it was <PB N="163" REF="161"> propo&s;ed to rai&s;e the re&s;t by &s;hares of
fifty pounds each. In &s;hort, Ego, in company with Charles, beat up the
quarters of all tho&s;e who, from di&s;ap|pointment, an adventurous &s;pirit,
or other motives, were likely to come into it; and, after &s;everal meetings,
many regulations, and other <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> it was at length
agreed that Charles &s;hould be the &s;ole conductor of the paper, have four
&s;hares for his two hundred pounds, and a &s;alary of two hun|dred a year:
but, as its failure, if it did not &s;uc|ceed, mu&s;t naturally be attributed
to his want of abilities to conduct it, he &s;hould be obliged, on its being
proved to be a lo&s;ing game every day for a fortnight together, to take all
their &s;hares back at the original price; and, on the other hand, if it
&s;ucceeded beyond expectation, he &s;hould be made a proportionable
amends.</P>
<P>The&s;e terms were extremely well reli&s;hed, and our hero took
the field as generali&s;&s;imo of diurnal critici&s;m. He detected the fallacy
of other papers, reprobated their venality, re&s;uted their arguments, and
&s;hewed the futility of all their proceedings; and, though the concern
&s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s almo&s;t every day, the world's eyes began to be opened,
and probably the matter would have been hand|&s;omely taken up, if internal
divi&s;ions had not con|vul&s;ed the whole plan. The fact was this: four of 
<PB N="164" REF="162"> the other papers had each &s;ent a purcha&s;er of a
&s;hare, who&s;e in&s;tructions were to kindle as much &s;trife as po&s;&s;ible
among the partners. Thus, upon &s;eparate grounds, they began to &s;plit this
little community into factions. One &s;aid a new&s;paper was not worth a
farthing that did not take a decided part; another that they ought to have
&s;ecured adverti&s;ements be|fore they had &s;tarted; a third was beginning,
when our hero begged leave to remark that no partner had a right to interfere
with the conduct of the paper. Let him then take up the &s;hares, according to
his agreement, was the an&s;wer. His was imme|diately at his &s;ervice. Charles
now too late &s;aw the drift of this. He &s;aid if he had known he had
em|barked with a &s;et of men who were afraid of a little ri&s;k, he would have
&s;et his face to the bu&s;ine&s;s alone at fir&s;t; but he was willing
neverthele&s;s to abide by all his agreement. He had certainly ran him&s;elf
out of ready ca&s;h, but if any gentlema would take his note, at a &s;hort
date, for the amount of his &s;hare it was heartily at his &s;ervice. Three
took him at his word, at that meeting, and, by a week afterwards, he was left
with but four part|ners.</P>
<P>Had the paper been dealt by hone&s;tly, it would have done
wonders; but the proprietors of the re&s;t, who had not the courage to defend
their mea&s;ures <PB N="165" REF="163"> openly&mdash;for indeed they were
indefen&s;ible&mdash;tam|pered with the news-carriers, and were guilty of a
thou&s;and other paltry &s;hifts and tricks, to prevent its circulation. They
al&s;o brided the printer to in&s;ert &s;uch words as rendered the writing
non&s;en&s;e, after the correction of the la&s;t proof, and when it was
impo&s;&s;ible to prevent its going in that &s;tate into the world.</P>
<P>There was a dirtine&s;s in the&s;e proceedings which Charles
could not &s;toop to a detection of. He doubled his &s;atire, and they their
arts, till at length every partner had begged to be off, and he was left alone
to &s;tem the torrent. He now found him&s;elf playing at a lo&s;ing game,
almo&s;t exhau&s;ted of all his ca&s;h, and engaged for the payment of &s;ix
hun|dred pounds; &s;o that, driven into every po&s;&s;ible corner, he was
compelled to &s;end this &s;cheme after the re&s;t, and &s;ell the materials
for a &s;upply.</P>
<P>Now it was that Charles di&s;covered who had been his partners
in the paper; for, their end being an&s;wered, they publi&s;hed his di&s;grace
in the mo&s;t triumphant language their virulent and low male|volence could
&s;ugge&s;t. They recapitulated all his former mi&s;carriages, gave an
invidious turn to his whole conduct, mi&s;repre&s;ented him in regard to his
opera, and warned the public how it encouraged a <PB N="166" REF="164"> man
who, in&s;tead of being avowedly its &s;ervant, had the arrogant pre&s;umption
to &s;et up a &s;tandard of ta&s;te, and the vanity to &s;uppo&s;e that all the
world mu&s;t bow to his <HI>ip&s;e dixit.</HI></P>
<P>Charles avoided, with every po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try, all chance
of getting into a per&s;onal quarrel upon this occa&s;ion; knowing that he
could reap no honour from a contention with men of no character, and that they
would, in their report of him, &s;o per|vert his motives of re&s;entment, as to
throw a public &s;tigma on him, let his conduct be ever &s;o
right.&mdash;Indeed his notions upon this &s;ubject were a little heteroclite,
for he maintained that duelling was not only a very barbarous, but a very
di&s;honourable cu&s;tom, and that it &s;erved more to a&s;&s;i&s;t the views
of cowards and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, than to &s;upport the dig|nity of &s;uch as
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed true courage.</P>
<P>In defence of this opinion, he certainly advanced a great deal
of per&s;ua&s;ive rea&s;oning, which unfortu|nately nobody li&s;tened to; for
people, however they break through e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms&mdash;whether by
&s;tealing your pur&s;e, or your peace of mind, or cutting your
throat&mdash;never appear publicly to di&s;|approve of them.</P>
<P>This very opinion was taken advantage of by 
<PB N="167" REF="165"> Glo&s;s, who negociated a quarrel &s;o well, that our
hero received a challenge from a ra&s;cal, and refu&s;ed to meet him. His
pu&s;illanimity was immediately the public topic, and though he was a &s;hort
time after under the unplea&s;ant nece&s;&s;ity of kicking the fellow out of a
coffee-hou&s;e who had had the im|pudence to traduce him, yet, in the next
company he went he &s;carcely was &s;poken to.</P>
<P>Charles, &s;ecurely wrapt up in his own con&s;cious honour,
certainly held all this in ineffable con|tempt; yet fearing le&s;t accumulated
provocation &s;hould induce him to depart from that forbearance which his
rectitude had pointed out in his ca&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary, he wi&s;ely
re&s;olved to read none of the abu&s;e written again&s;t him, le&s;t he
&s;hould be pro|voked into a reply that would make his competi|tors of more
con&s;equence than he wi&s;hed. He re|lied on the candour of the public for a
tacit refuta|tion of all calumny what&s;oever, and, in&s;tead of in|volving
him&s;elf in more troubles, began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider how he could get
rid of tho&s;e with which he was already &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>He had about &s;eventy pounds, and the furniture of his hou&s;e,
which was decent and convenient, but no more. The earlie&s;t of his notes was
within five days of being due, and a fortnight more would bring 
<PB N="168" REF="166"> the re&s;t upon his back; in con&s;equence of which, all
the horrors of a pri&s;on, and the mercile&s;s &s;everity of bailiffs, who owed
him &s;o much ill will, would be inevitable.</P>
<P>To avoid the&s;e unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances, he re|&s;olved to
go to France, which determination how|ever he imparted to nobody but his
faithful hou&s;e|keeper, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s had been upon a par with his; for
Ego had brought her intelligence that there was no knowing what to make of
Emma, that the mini&s;try was changed, and Mr. Glo&s;s now filled a high and
con&s;picuous &s;ituation, and, in &s;hort, that every thing in that quarter
menaced our hero's affairs with ruin and total de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Marlow, when &s;he had fancied things wore a
brighter complexion, had deter|mined to put the be&s;t face on the matter to
Charles, finding them in this de&s;perate way, &s;he &s;aw there was no time
for trifling. Be&s;ides, Mr. Glo&s;s's &s;ituation was a public town talk, and
all the re&s;t would be known of cour&s;e. Indeed the good crea|ture could not
di&s;&s;emble; her very heart &s;poke in her eyes, and he &s;aw his
wretchedne&s;s before &s;he uttered a &s;yllable.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance greatly perplexed Charles, 
<PB N="169" REF="167"> and made him wi&s;h to &s;eclude him&s;elf from all the
world. Mr. Figgins had certainly been in town, but had not called upon him.
Indeed a my&s;tery had hung over that gentleman's conduct for &s;ome time. When
Charles conferred on him the annuity, he received a letter thanking him in
terms of &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic warmth, that he thought it a little
over|&s;trained, and &s;ome &s;u&s;picious matters had &s;ince in|duced him to
believe that his old friend, finding he had got all he could, now turned his
back upon him, which the reader, no more than Charles, will think an
extraordinary conjecture. But what were now his &s;en&s;ations, when he found,
beyond all doubt, that this very friend who had &s;worn &s;o hear|tily never to
de&s;ert his intere&s;t, who knew all the &s;ecrets of his &s;oul, who, in
&s;hort, had more power than any man in the world to &s;hew his enemies how to
take advantage of him, had gone over to Mr. Glo&s;s.</P>
<P>Charles had all his life wanted a friend; he had been very often
plunged in misfortune, but this was the fir&s;t time that he &s;aw him&s;elf on
the brink of actual poverty, without a &s;ingle re&s;ource. The brute
Mu&s;quito was ma&s;ter of an ample fortune, the pliant Toogood had a
profitable place, and even that echo of his own prai&s;e, Ego, had &s;at
him&s;elf <PB N="170" REF="168"> down comfortably. The&s;e men had nothing for
which they ought to be rewarded, but much that merited reprehen&s;ion; while
he, who&s;e whole &s;tudy had been to benefit the public, who had, in &s;pight
of all the malignity that had overwhelmed him, the te&s;timony of hundreds to
the purity of his in|tentions, which had been evinced by a &s;trong worldly
proof&mdash;no le&s;s than throwing down &s;ome thou&s;ands in the
pro&s;ecution of his laudable plan&mdash;he, in an early period of life, mu&s;t
now learn the bitter ta&s;k of bearing di&s;tre&s;s, and yielding to actual
want.</P>
<P>Charles, however, happened to have a mind not ea&s;ily to be
broken. 
<Q REND="inline">'Come Mrs. Marlow,' &s;aid he, as they talked
over his affairs, 'let us &s;et our faces to the weather. They think that under
&s;uch accumulated misfortunes I &s;hall &s;ink, and they will get rid of me;
and indeed were I not of a different temper from any other man, it would be
&s;o: but I am not of a mind to indulge my ene|mies: we mu&s;t not lie down in
this world for want of re&s;ources; and, I thank God, my ima|gination flatters
me I &s;hall not be to &s;eek for them, even though experience &s;hould, as
u&s;ual, de&s;troy all my hopes upon proof. At pre&s;ent certainly this kingdom
is no place for me, and it has &s;truck me that, by quitting it, I can not only
<PB N="171" REF="169"> turn my pur&s;uits to advantage, but in that very way
that, had I not been a fool, I &s;hould all along have preferred to the
&s;traight forward reproba|tion of duplicity, by which the world's good opinion
is not to be gained. In &s;hort, I will tell you what I will do. I will get
into Flanders, &s;eat my&s;elf in an ob&s;cure lodging, and copy every thing I
can lay my hands upon. HOLBEIN, or HEMSKIRK, TENIERS, or HOBIMA, WYNANTS, or
VANDERVELDT; nothing &s;hall come ami&s;s to me; and when I have &s;tocked
my&s;elf with a &s;uf|ficient collection, properly &s;moaked, varni&s;hed, and
mutilated, they &s;hall be put up to auction in the Engli&s;h metropolis, as
the collection of a gen|tleman who died upon his travels.'</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow declared &s;he had now &s;ome hopes of him, and
begged he would &s;et about it imme|diately.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I will,' &s;aid Charles, with a profound
&s;igh, 'and yet it is very hard to be cut off from every hope. I could have
borne any thing, every thing, &s;u&s;tained torture, and called it plea&s;ure,
could I &s;till have flattered my&s;elf with the hopes of ob|taining Annette.
Oh let no man place his hap|pine&s;s on the promi&s;es of a woman. I could have
endured mi&s;ery, beggary for her. Want and all <PB N="172" REF="170"> its grim
train, &s;hould have been my welcome companions. I would have ble&s;&s;ed the
moment that made me wretched to prove my love. But, come, no weakne&s;s; let me
feel, but not mur|mur; let me, &s;ince there is nothing el&s;e with which I can
reproach my&s;elf, &s;o forget the dig|nity of my love as to reproach her. No,
however &s;he may excel me in happine&s;s and fortune, &s;he never &s;hall be
my &s;uperior in truth and honour.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A VERY UNEXPECTED VISIT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY invention having been exhau&s;ted to ward off the coming
blow, without &s;ucce&s;s, Charles be|gan in earne&s;t to think of retiring to
the continent: to which he was not a little &s;timulated by his new &s;cheme.
He was &s;o clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, that he was obliged to decamp in the middle
of the night; for he had heard, that very morning, that a writ had been
obtained again&s;t him, from one of his mo&s;t invete|rate enemies&mdash;though
the note o which account it was i&s;&s;ued was not due&mdash;upon a pretence
that it was his intention to leave the kingdom.</P>
<P>It was eleven o'clock in the night that this &s;cheme was to be
put in execution. Our hero had ju&s;t &s;upped, and &s;poken the&s;e parting
words to Mrs. Marlow. 
<Q REND="inline">'Since I have lo&s;t every friend upon earth but
you; &s;ince, in this country, men of ho|ne&s;t principles cannot flouri&s;h;
&s;ince my love and honour have been equally betrayed, and every 
<PB N="174" REF="172"> worthy effort to gain the world's e&s;teem and &s;e|cure
a faithful return to my hopele&s;s affection has been attended with nothing but
ingratitude, &s;hame, and di&s;appointment, I go to find a little
recollec|tion, and to &s;hake off this &s;trange dream of fruit|le&s;s
expectation in another country; and, &s;ince I have found to my mortification
that here the whole world lives in a happy delirium, and en|joys no plea&s;ure
but through the medium of be|ing cheated by their own con&s;ent, I will one day
or other return and admini&s;ter to their amu&s;ement in the only way any man
can hope for &s;ucce&s;s: the hone&s;ty of which I now fairly &s;ub&s;cribe to;
for how can it be &s;aid that people are impo&s;ed upon when they con&s;ent to
the deception. Hav|ing made, by means like the&s;e, a competency, you and I, my
dear Marlow, will retire to &s;ome &s;nug retreat, where, as at a comedy, we
will look at the world, and laugh, but never venture again to have any thing to
do with it, otherwi&s;e than as &s;pectators, for fear of the humiliation that,
as ac|tors, we &s;hould be &s;ure to meet with.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The&s;e are &s;trange declarations in &s;o
young a man, but they are perfectly rea&s;onable, perfectly hone&s;t, and I can
&s;et the point I aim at within my view as ea&s;ily as Mr. Glo&s;s, though
perhaps I may not attain it by means &s;o ra&s;cally. And now 
<PB N="175" REF="173"> my good, my kind friend, adieu. There is an
in|&s;trument by which the furniture of this hou&s;e is become yours. It is a
poor pre&s;ent, but per|haps it may a&s;&s;i&s;t you, through the medium of
letting lodgings, to eke out the little I may be able to &s;end you. At
pre&s;ent I can very well &s;pare you forty pounds, and, that you may not have
a word to &s;ay in reply, I promi&s;e you, if I &s;hould be in nece&s;&s;ity, I
will as freely have re|cour&s;e to you.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles then ran over all his former &s;chemes, and &s;hewed in
what in&s;tances he would make them &s;erve as a warning as to his future
intentions, which he had &s;trenuou&s;ly at heart, and through which he doubted
not he &s;hould one day be able to &s;hew how greatly he could be independant,
with barely a com|petency. He &s;poke of the treachery of Figgins, but &s;till
attributed that, as well as every other mi&s;|fortune, to his own &s;tupid
credulity alone; for that he ought to have known what a world he lived in, and
not have &s;uffered him&s;elf to be impo&s;ed upon. 
<Q REND="inline">'And yet,' &s;aid he, 'my dear Mrs. Marlow,
there is a circum&s;tance that I mu&s;t complain of, though it is taxing
perfection, arraigning heaven it&s;elf! But this is not the time to awaken any
feeling; to &s;tagger my re&s;olution. Still I would wi&s;h you to &s;ee that
fal&s;e, that lovely creature; to &s;ee <PB N="176" REF="174"> Emma too. Do not
however upbraid either of them. Let them only know that they impo&s;ed upon a
heart that de&s;erved better of them; that it &s;hall break, mi&s;ery &s;hall
di&s;&s;olve it, torture tear it, before it &s;hall con&s;ent to a &s;ingle
murmur, though but a whi&s;per. Tell my Annette to be happy; to be &s;upremely
ble&s;t, without an in|truding care; and to think that I am too fortu|nate if I
have &s;ecured her happine&s;s at &s;o trifling an expence as the lo&s;s of my
peace. Tell her&mdash;but indeed it is dreadful; I cannot at pre&s;ent bear the
conflict, and I mu&s;t&mdash;heavenly powers!&mdash;but come, let me be a man,
and keep my &s;en&s;es.'</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words he reclined again&s;t the wain&s;cot, with one
hand on his forehead, the other on his heart, and his eyes turned upwards, as
if imploring tho&s;e powers which, if we may judge of what im|mediately
followed, were as deaf to his calls as the hearts of his pretended friends had
been to the calls of honour.</P>
<P>As he &s;tood in this attitude, and as Mrs. Marlow contemplated
him with ineffable complacency, and tender &s;orrow, a loud knocking was heard
at the door. What could it be? At that time of night too! Certainly Charles's
enemies had been apprized of his intentions, and were determined to prevent 
<PB N="177" REF="175"> his e&s;cape. 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord,' cried Mrs. Marlow, 'what &s;hall we
do?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Do,' &s;aid Charles, 'why if they will have me,
I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not for the world,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow. 'For
God's &s;ake, my dear &s;ir, go up &s;tairs: pretty high if you plea&s;e: and
if you find it is any thing of that &s;ort, fairly go out of the garret window,
and creep on three doors farther, to Mr. Lott's.&mdash;You can ea&s;ily get
along the gutter, and, after the coa&s;t is clear, I will go to Mr. Lott's,
apprize them of the truth, and you &s;hall &s;tay there till a proper
time.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles made &s;ome objections to Mrs. Marlow's expedient, but a
&s;econd thundering at the door overruled them. And now Mrs. Marlow went boldly
to demand who it was that paid them this un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Before &s;he would open the door, &s;he called to know who was
there. She was an&s;wered by a po&s;tillion&mdash;for &s;he could &s;ee his
dre&s;s and his whip through the key hole, by the light of the lamp&mdash;that
there were &s;ome of Mr. Hazard's friends out of the country, in a chai&s;e,
who mu&s;t &s;ee him even at that time of night.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow, overjoyed with the hopes that her 
<PB N="178" REF="176"> friend's affairs might have taken &s;ome favourable
turn, and, at any rate, guarded as we have &s;een again&s;t &s;ini&s;ter
con&s;equences, made no &s;cruple of opening the door, which &s;he had no
&s;ooner done than two men handed a lady out of a chai&s;e, and all together
came within the door: one of the gen|tlemen de&s;iring the lady might be
&s;hewn into a room. This Mrs. Marlow, who was greatly &s;truck with the lady's
uncommon beauty, &s;crupled not to do; after which, one of the gentlemen,
tak|ing her a&s;ide, begged Mr. Hazard would come to them immediately, for that
the lady was Mi&s;s Roe|buck.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words Mrs. Marlow flew up &s;tairs, and, in le&s;s
than a minute, introduced our hero, fir&s;t hav|ing informed him that &s;he
would bring him to a friend who&s;e pre&s;ence would make him ample amends for
all his former troubles, but who that friend could be, in &s;pight of all his
entreaties, &s;he left him to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>If our hero's faculties were upon the &s;tretch, to find who
this extraordinary friend could be, who, contrary to the hard cu&s;toms of the
times, had ge|nerou&s;ly &s;ought the dwelling of the unfortunate, what was his
exce&s;&s;ive a&s;toni&s;hment when a gleam that had &s;tarted acro&s;s his
&s;u&s;pended thoughts, ju&s;t <PB N="179" REF="177"> as he arrived at the
door, was pre&s;ently realized by the &s;ight of her who held his captive
&s;oul, who now &s;at in the very chair out of which, ten minutes before, he
had him&s;elf ri&s;en.</P>
<P> He &s;tarted much more naturally than I have &s;een a hero on
the &s;tage at the &s;ight of a gho&s;t, and ex|claimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'Heavens and earth! Am I awake? Is it
po&s;&s;ible that the divine Annette&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No &s;ir,' exclaimed the lady, with great
anger, 'it is not po&s;&s;ible that &s;he can come any where, by her own
con&s;ent, into your pre&s;ence, unle&s;s to tell you how much &s;he di&s;dains
your low arts.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For God's &s;ake madam,' cried Charles, in an
agony, 'what do you mean? Am I to be every way tortured? Is my whole life to be
a dream? Am I to comprehend nothing?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Admirably acted,' &s;aid the lady; 'I wanted
but this to be convinced.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Convinced of what, ma|dam?' cried Charles'
'that my exi&s;tence, my very &s;oul is in your power, and therefore you can
tor|ture it at will.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For &s;hame,' cried Annette, 'I only want to
a&s;k you one que&s;tion. Do you think, by this <PB N="180" REF="178"> violent
conduct, to accompli&s;h your wi&s;hes. Do you not think by it that you have,
and with rea|&s;on, lo&s;t my father for ever.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know I have lo&s;t him, madam,' cried
Charles; 'I was told too I had lo&s;t you; and now, le&s;t I &s;hould doubt the
truth of my being completely mi&s;erable, you are conde&s;cending enough to put
me entirely out of pain, by confirming it with your own mouth: in this
extraordinary manner too, at this un&s;ea&s;onable hour.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Wretch,' cried Annette, 'can you pretend to
charge me with what you have cau&s;ed your&s;elf? Is not the whole your own
doing? Has not your unhappy impetuo&s;ity undone you? And now, in&s;tead of
defending your&s;elf, you are determined I &s;hall be no more out of doubt than
the re&s;t. In &s;hort, I am convinced that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be on terms
with you, and I declare to you, in &s;o many words&mdash;though I will not &s;o
fal&s;ify my character as to &s;ay it does not pain me to make the
effort&mdash;I will never be yours.'</Q></P>
<P>As this moment, as if in a violent flurry, in ru&s;hed Mr.
Glo&s;s. 
<Q REND="inline">'And here,' cried Charles, 'is the happy man who
is to witne&s;s my di&s;grace, and triumph over me; but, by all that is
&s;acred, <PB N="181" REF="179"> he &s;hall not live to enjoy this happine&s;s;
for this hand&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, he ran to his pi&s;tols, which he had loaded to
take with him, at which both Annette and Mrs. Marlow &s;creamed. Mr. Glo&s;s
told them not to be afraid; adding, with a &s;neer, that no harm would happen,
which probably he knew, for another per&s;on who then entered the room caught
hold of Charles's arm, and proclaimed aloud that he had an action again&s;t
him.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then all is over,' &s;aid Charles,</Q> and
dropt into a chair. Annette, at this moment, was not in a better condition.
Le&s;t however &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover her confu&s;ion to Charles, &s;he
begged Mr. Glo&s;s would conduct her home, declaring &s;he felt her&s;elf
greatly indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't doubt it, madam,' &s;aid Mr.
Glo&s;s:&mdash;'the gentleman however &s;hall &s;mart for it. You triumphed
&s;ir,' &s;aid he, 'when la&s;t this lady was in danger; now I think it is my
turn.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thine!' cried Charles, &s;tarting from his
re|verie. 'Worm! Reptile! Thy turn to triumph over me! But I thank you madam,'
&s;aid he to Annette. 'It is plain you wanted an excu&s;e in the 
<PB N="182" REF="180"> opinion of the world for the mo&s;t inexcu&s;eable trait
of fal&s;hood and levity that ever di&s;graced your &s;ex; and I may &s;ay now
that <HI>you</HI> have well acted your part: and &s;o madam adieu. There is yet
time, before you &s;leep, to glut the ear of your father with the information
that my downfal is completed. And now &s;ir,' &s;aid he to the man who had
arre&s;ted him, 'I am ready for you.'</Q>&mdash;Saying the&s;e words, he
&s;natched up his hat, and left fir&s;t the room, and then the hou&s;e, in
company with the bailiff and his follower.</P>
<P> The moment Charles had walked off, as we have de&s;cribed,
Annette cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh, Mr. Glo&s;s, I am very ill,'</Q> and fell
lifele&s;s on the floor. Mrs. Marlow was not idle: &s;he produced &s;ome drops,
which revived her in the cour&s;e of a few minutes; but it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed that good old lady's atten|tion was of a very chequered kind; for
though hu|manity had obliged her to pay Annette every po&s;&s;i|ble re&s;pect
in her then &s;ituation, yet her heart bled for the &s;ufferings of poor
Charles, to which &s;he could not help thinking that Mr. Glo&s;s, at lea&s;t,
had contributed, by this la&s;t unmanly bu&s;ine&s;s of the arre&s;t, which
&s;he was induced to believe he had connived at through cowardice: le&s;t, had
our hero fair play, he mu&s;t have an&s;wered to him this trea|chery, and that
very &s;everely.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="181"> Under this idea, when Annette came to
her&s;elf, Mrs. Marlow did not &s;pare to exclaim again&s;t the &s;candalous
conduct of tho&s;e who had, &s;he &s;aid, by &s;preading the mo&s;t infamous
and injurious calumny, wounded the character of a young gentleman, who had no
equal in the world.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I believe &s;o,' &s;aid Glo&s;s, with an
invidious leer, 'for egregious folly, intolerable pride, and un|bounded
profligacy. But come madam,' &s;aid he to Annette, 'I believe there is a coach
at the door, and we want no advice from this good lady, who of cour&s;e is
partial to him who&s;e bread &s;he eats.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do eat his bread,' cried Mrs. Marlow, 'and
heaven is my witne&s;s I would not eat it if I did not know him to be what I
&s;ay. I know he is the worthie&s;t, be&s;t, gentle&s;t, noble&s;t creature
that ever did honour to human nature. I know his &s;oul is above every thing
that is ungenerous or unju&s;t. I know, in &s;hort, he is the very rever&s;e of
you, from whom I have not been able to take off my eyes ever &s;ince you came
into the room; and I will tell you why: I look on you with horror, and believe
you capable of every thing horrid and infamous; for you are the very picture of
a man whom I knew to be the mo&s;t villainous and de&s;picable upon
earth.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="182"> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am much obliged to you madam,' &s;aid Mr
Glo&s;s, 'for your eulogium; and now I believe we have no further bu&s;ine&s;s
here.'</Q> So &s;aying, he gave his hand to Annette, who had been drowned in
tears for &s;ome minutes, and who now retired with her protector, as he called
him&s;elf, without the power of paying her acknowledgments to Mrs. Mar|low &s;o
warmly as the ca&s;e required, or her wi&s;hes prompted her.</P>

<P>IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND MUCH MORE THAN HE EXPECTED,</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A MOST mi&s;erable night did poor Mrs. Marlow pa&s;s in our
hero's ab&s;ence. She did not know where he was gone, or by what means to get
any tidings of him. In this exigence &s;he would have waited on Mr. Balance, a
&s;tep which &s;he repented &s;he had not taken before&mdash;but as all her
cogitations terminated in a re&s;olution to adopt no active mea|&s;ure of her
own head, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould injure him &s;he <PB N="186" REF="184">
wi&s;hed to &s;erve, &s;he even &s;at her&s;elf down quietly, and waited with
the mo&s;t tantalizing impatience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, by hearing from him, &s;he &s;hould be relea&s;ed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">om her anxiety.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances had &s;he remained, like a timid
hare in her form, dreading &s;he knew not what, till about two o'clock the next
day, when &s;he heard as violent a thundering at the door as &s;he had heard
the night before. She immediately flew to the door, and let in not our hero,
but a gentleman who &s;aid Mr. Hazard mu&s;t be found, if he was above ground,
for that his brother lay at the point of death, and that he was come po&s;t
ha&s;te from the country, to con&s;ult him on &s;ome family matters, which were
of the la&s;t importance.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow begged his pardon, but could not conceive in what
way Lord Hazard's death could po&s;&s;ibly affect his brother: that nobleman,
&s;he fancied, had nothing but the title and e&s;tate to give, and tho&s;e
would of cour&s;e go to his infant &s;on, who, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, was not
lying at the point of death. As to any legacies, &s;he did not believe his
lord&s;hip had lived &s;o frugal as to have any to leave; and, were not this
the ca&s;e, &s;he could not be inclined to think his good will towards his
brother extended <PB N="187" REF="185"> &s;o far as to have induced him to do
any thing in his favour.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger &s;aid &s;he was perfectly right, but yet his
bu&s;ine&s;s with him was of a particular nature.&mdash;In &s;hort, neither
could make any thing of the other: what the &s;trangers &s;entiments were we
&s;hall &s;ee.</P>
<P>As to Mrs. Marlow, &s;he thought this chicken was of the &s;ame
brood with the re&s;t, and that he only wanted to get out of her what he could,
per|haps to lay a detainer again&s;t Charles, or for &s;ome other purpo&s;e
equally inimical.</P>
<P>At the end of four days&mdash;for till then had this poor
friendly creature been tormented with alter|nate hopes and fears&mdash;&s;he
received a letter, by the po&s;t, on which &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee
the po&s;t|mark O&s;tend, but her a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till high|tened by
noticing the hand writing of her friend and benefactor. This was the letter.

of anxiety upon my account, I <PB N="188" REF="186"> take the very earlie&s;t
opportunity of relieving you from it, by informing you by what means I am able
to date a letter from this place.</P>
<P> Sen&s;ibly as I felt at leaving that fal&s;e deluded
creature in the hands of her betrayer and mine, I had no &s;ooner got into the
&s;treet, than I began to think my pecuniary affairs, at that moment, de|manded
my fir&s;t attention. I therefore prevailed upon the bailiff to accompany me to
a tavern, rather than to any hou&s;e of &s;ecurity, that, if po&s;|&s;ible, I
might hit upon &s;ome terms of accommo|dation. This, after a &s;hort
he&s;itation, he con|&s;ented to. There, while I plied him with wine, a thought
&s;truck me that this &s;hould be my fir&s;t attempt at impo&s;ition, which I
the le&s;s he&s;itated at, as the fellow was a notorious ra&s;cal. This
&s;troke, as it has been attended with &s;ucce&s;s, I have no doubt but I
&s;hall hereafter follow it up with others, till our competency will be
&s;ecure, and then I promi&s;e you not all the Annettes upon earth &s;hall draw
from me a &s;ingle &s;igh.</P>
<P> I begged his patient attention to what I was go|ing to
&s;ay. I then told him that when I was la&s;t in France I fell in love with a
young lady of con|&s;iderable merit and fortune, who would, without reluctance,
give me her hand, as &s;oon as I &s;hould <PB N="189" REF="187"> arrive on the
continent; that the amour in que&s;|tion had created a jealou&s;y in the young
lady he had &s;een; and that I was very &s;ure the bu&s;ine&s;s of the writ had
been connived at with a view of keep|ing me from quitting the kingdom; that I
would, to come to the point, make him all the amends in my power, if he would,
in any way, &s;uffer me to e&s;cape.</P>
<P> To my great &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;for I did not think this
would half do with him&mdash;he appeared willing to treat, and, in &s;hort,
after many &s;cruples&mdash;&s;uch as that he &s;hould certainly have the whole
debt and co&s;ts to pay, and others equally cogent&mdash;he agreed, late as it
was, to knock up two of his friends, to be bail for me, who, to make &s;hort of
the &s;tory, appeared, and I gave a bond among them, to pay a hundred pounds
when I &s;hould return to En|gland, provided that event took place in three
months; a hundred and fifty if it exceeded &s;ix; and double that &s;um if I
returned a married man.</P>
<P> As I know the&s;e fellows to be as voracious as pikes, you
may ea&s;ily gue&s;s I lo&s;t not a moment in making the be&s;t u&s;e of my
time. Thus, of cour&s;e, I did not come home, nor would I tru&s;t my&s;elf to
write to you till I touched this ground, <PB N="190" REF="188"> le&s;t my next
letter &s;hould be wor&s;e to you than the &s;u&s;pence I know you have kindly
felt, by giving you an account of a &s;econd lo&s;s of liberty.</P>
<P> I &s;hall wait in this place a week; I beg there|fore you
will write the moment you receive this, and I charge you, as you value truth
and my friend&s;hip, qualify nothing; let me have the &s;im|ple undi&s;gui&s;ed
matter of fact; particularly as to Annette. If &s;he con&s;ent to marry that
ra&s;cal Glo&s;s, though my fir&s;t feelings will be a wi&s;h to come to
England, purpo&s;ely to cut her hu&s;band's ears off, my &s;econd, which will
very &s;oon &s;uc|ceed the other, will &s;ettle all other con&s;iderations into
contempt, and then I &s;hall be in &s;uch a frame of mind as to make me
obliterate a &s;et of people from my memory, in whom I have been mi&s;taken.
Surely this will be moderate enough.</P>
<P> As &s;oon as I get your letter, and have delibe|rated a
little on my pre&s;ent affairs, I &s;hall endea|vour to get among the Flemings.
Pray do not let a &s;ingle &s;oul at pre&s;ent know where I am. This country is
not &s;o &s;afe as France. You will find enclo&s;ed the forty pounds which our
extraordi|nary vi&s;itants prevented me from giving you. I have no pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion for it, and you can lay part of it out to advantage in decorating my
old <PB N="191" REF="189"> apartments, for the accommodation of lodgers. If in
that, or any way, they can be turned to your advantage, it will give me more
plea&s;ure than it po&s;&s;ibly could to occupy them my&s;elf; but re|member, I
charge you not to attempt returning this money, or any thing &s;imilar to it,
for I de|clare mo&s;t &s;olemnly, if you do, I will not let you know my route;
in which ca&s;e your intention will be defeated: for, be&s;ide the hazard, I
can in that ca&s;e return what you &s;end; whereas you will be deprived of a
&s;imilar advantage. At the &s;ame time, to make you perfectly ea&s;y, I will
permit you to do what you can for me, if I &s;hould be in actual
nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P> You &s;ee, my dear Mrs. Marlow, I mu&s;t &s;till be proud;
but ought not a man to be &s;o who is determined to impo&s;e upon all the
world? He ought to be a clever fellow, and therefore &s;hould be proud. In
truth, one &s;hould not laugh at this, for I cannot conceive a more melancholy
reflec|tion than that the intellects of mankind are &s;o very &s;lender, &s;o
filmy, &s;uch a perfect cobweb, that nothing in nature is &s;o ea&s;y as to
dupe the&s;e lords of the creation, through their own conni|vance.</P>
<P> Adieu: write immediately, directed to the 
<PB N="192" REF="190"> po&s;t office, but do not, upon any account, ven|ture a
&s;econd letter till I have an&s;wered the fir&s;t. Another thing remember: put
all letters into the po&s;t your&s;elf. My whole downfal among the Roebucks is
imputable, you know, to intercepted letters; though they, poor dupes&mdash;is
it not true that people are ea&s;ily duped?&mdash;do not even yet believe
it.</P>
<CLOSER>

HAZARD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>As I mean now to watch our hero's progre&s;s for &s;ome time,
which, by the bye, is but fair&mdash;as he is de&s;erted by every other
friend&mdash;I &s;hall &s;ay, at pre|&s;ent, that nothing of any con&s;equence
happened to him at O&s;tend, but the receipt of the following letter, from Mrs.
Marlow, in an&s;wer to the pre|ceding one. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>WORTHY SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> Before I received your letter, I had ga|thered a great deal
of news for you. God be prai&s;ed that you are in a place of &s;afety. Here I 
<PB N="193" REF="191"> believe the people are all mad. The made&s;t of them is
her you and I, a month ago, would have &s;worn was not to be changed. In
&s;hort, what &s;ignifies hiding it, Mi&s;s Roebuck that was, is now Mrs.
Glo&s;s. I have &s;een her my&s;elf, and &s;poken to her; but indeed I am &s;o
flurried I don't know where to begin fir&s;t. They have made me mad among them,
but I have left off writing to cry a little, and now I &s;hall have patience to
tell you every thing in form.</P>
<P> You mu&s;t know, the day after you left the hou&s;e, a
gentleman came in a violent hurry, with a &s;trange &s;tory, that your brother
lay at the point of death; but I took him for &s;ome enemy, and &s;o &s;ent him
away with a flea in his ear. I have been vexed at it ever &s;ince, for the news
about his pre|cious lord&s;hip is true: nay, it is now reported he is dead. But
what is this to you? You know &s;ir there are two infant Lord Hazards in being.
When he comes next however I &s;han't &s;nap him up &s;o &s;hort.</P>
<P> You are to under&s;tand that your brother's ill|ne&s;s was
occa&s;ioned by an accident when he was hunting. His hor&s;e plunged into a
river, and he, for &s;ome time, was &s;o entangled in the &s;tir|rups, 
<PB N="194" REF="192"> that he had like to have been drowned:&mdash;but you
&s;aved him from the other fate in France, and his good &s;tars from this in
England. As he was however &s;ometime in his wet clothes, and&mdash;being half
tip&s;y&mdash;would, pig like, in&s;i&s;t upon not changing them&mdash;&s;aying
that nothing ever hurt an Engli&s;h &s;port&s;man in the cha&s;e&mdash;he was
taken the next day very ill, and, as I &s;aid before, the re|port now is that
he is dead.</P>
<P> So much for him: God ble&s;s him, and &s;end him better off
in the other world than he wi&s;hed people to be in this.</P>
<P> My next vi&s;itor was Mr. Ego, who, with a long face, and I
think real concern&mdash;but there is no knowing any body&mdash;told me that
Mi&s;s Roe|buck had certainly con&s;ented to have Mr. Glo&s;s; that the wedding
clothes were be&s;poke, the li|cence purcha&s;ed, and the day fixed.</P>
<P> I thought it now high time I &s;hould begin to look about
me, and &s;o put on my hat and cloak, and went directly to Sir Sidney's
hou&s;e. I &s;aw both Mi&s;s and her very good, her very wi&s;e friend, Mrs.
Emma, who has been bribed over to Glo&s;s's &s;ide, or I will never pretend to
judge of any thing again. Well I only begged to know from the 
<PB N="195" REF="193"> young lady's mouth whether the report I had heard was
true. She &s;aid it was. I a&s;ked if it was true that the wedding cloaths were
be&s;poke? Yes was the an&s;wer again. If the licence was ready? Yes. And when
was the happy day to be? The next day but one. And now, &s;aid Mrs. Emma,
putting in her word, you may carry this information to your friend, and tell
him&mdash;</P>
<P> Here &s;he repeated &s;ome non&s;en&s;e from a book, that I
cannot remember; but it was &s;omething about taking your enemy in their arms.
To make &s;hort of it, I came away. The appointed day was ye&s;terday, and I
have this morning, with my own eyes, &s;een an account of the wedding in the
new&s;papers.</P>
<P> There&mdash;there is your tender, con&s;tant, Mi&s;s
Annette for you! And now I can only &s;ay if it makes you unea&s;y one hour,
you are not the man of &s;en&s;e I take you for. What the deuce are the&s;e
people to plot together, and creep, and fetch, and carry, and de&s;troy the
health and peace of a young gentleman twenty times their betters?&mdash;for he,
let them think as they plea&s;e, would not break his word, no that he would
not, for the world. I'll a&s;&s;ure them! What would they have next? But I am
getting mad with them again. <PB N="196" REF="194"> Oh my dear &s;ir, how I
would be revenged if I was you. I wi&s;h the &s;tory was true that you told
that na&s;ty fellow, with all my heart. I &s;ome|times think it is, only that
the lady fell in love with you, for that is more likely; and, if &s;he had, I
am &s;ure you would have more honour than to tell. If it is true, do, dear
&s;ir, marry her, if only to &s;pite them.</P>
<P> I don't know what el&s;e to &s;ay. As to the forty pounds,
you have &s;topt my mouth: it is hard however that you will be &s;o very proud.
Lord how could you write about decorating your apart|ments for any body el&s;e?
A king could not de|&s;erve to have them &s;o hand&s;ome as your&s;elf. I
a&s;|&s;ure you if I had not cried heartily I don't know what I &s;hould have
done with my&s;elf when I came to that part of your letter.</P>
<P> God ble&s;s you &s;ir, and &s;end you as happy as you
de&s;erve to be, and then you will be much happier than any of your Annettes
could have made you. I have not patience with them. But come &s;ir, keep up
your &s;pirits, for &s;omething tells me all is for the be&s;t. Go things how
they will, you are &s;ure of one true friend: for I will work my fingers to the
bone for you.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="195"> Remember your promi&s;e, that if you
&s;hould want you will apply to me. But why do I &s;ay remember your promi&s;e?
Did you ever forget a promi&s;e? Be&s;ides, you know you are not to cheat me,
though you do all the world. I wi&s;h all the world had not &s;o cheated
you.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Charles had &s;o far cheated Mrs. Marlow, not|with&s;tanding her
opinion of his hone&s;ty, that he did not inform her of giving the bailiff five
guineas, as an accommodation fee, nor his paying the co&s;ts; all which,
together with the expence of his journey and pa&s;&s;age, &s;unk his &s;tock to
nineteen guineas; but he had not the heart to curtail the old gentle|woman of a
&s;ingle guinea.</P>
<P>He was fitting in his lodging counting this &s;um, and
con&s;idering what he &s;hould do with it, when the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e,
who had called at the po&s;t office, by his de&s;ire, brought him the foregoing
letter.</P>
<P>It is pity my time is now &s;o precious that I can|not give an
accurate de&s;cription of Charles's recep|tion <PB N="198" REF="196"> of the
news this letter contained. No mad hero in romance ever played over &s;uch a
number of cu|rious gambols; no, not the made&s;t copier of them all, in the
made&s;t of his curvets and caprioles, in the mountains of Morena. The Fleming
at who&s;e hou&s;e he lodged, might have &s;worn he was a tum|bler, or a
lunatic. One moment he &s;tampt and raved; the next, mea&s;ured his length upon
the floor; then &s;tarting up, he, for about ten minutes, took a fit of
execrating all the world, but mo&s;t him&s;elf. Next Glo&s;s's throat was to be
cut: in &s;hort, if all his incoherencies were to have been literally put in
practice, he would have annihilated Glo&s;s, pi&s;tolled Figgins, called Sir
Sidney an old fool, upbraided Annette as the mo&s;t infamous of her &s;ex,
kicked Emma to the devil, and then followed her him&s;elf; for &s;o we may
fairly con&s;true his &s;aying he would nobly fall in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>When this &s;torm had a little &s;ub&s;ided, he called the
affrighted Fleming into his pre&s;ence, made an apology for his outrageous
conduct, and de&s;ired that a &s;urgeon might be &s;ent for. At the &s;ame time
he bid him take an account of &s;ome of the furniture, which he had broken in
his rage, and which he ob|&s;erved his landlord to eye with tokens of grief and
a&s;toni&s;hment, as it lay &s;cattered about the floor.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="197"> The &s;urgeon being come, Charles told
him, in the mo&s;t placid manner, that he had heard &s;ome un|plea&s;ant news
from England, of the death of a rela|tion; that it had put him into that
ferment which I have &s;o imperfectly de&s;cribed; and, le&s;t a fever &s;hould
be the con&s;equence, he begged to be bled. The &s;urgeon perfectly approved of
the precaution, and immediately proceeded to work; after which our hero went to
bed, where a comfortable potation, advi&s;ed by a phy&s;ician, and prepared by
an apothe|cary, who, &s;eeing their brother profe&s;&s;or enter the Fleming's
hou&s;e, from the corner of a &s;treet, where they were in deep con&s;ultation,
about the different con&s;truction of &s;yringes, dropt their controver&s;y to
follow him.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions operating with &s;ome calm, undi&s;turbed
advice, which our hero had by this time whi&s;pered to him&s;elf, brought him
into &s;uch a &s;tate of tranquillity, that he pur&s;ued his journey the next
morning, and, in due time, arrived at the ancient city of Ghent. Here he
immediately looked for a lodging, and, at length, fixed him&s;elf to his
&s;atisfaction, in the upper apartments of an uphol|&s;terer, where the fir&s;t
floor was occupied by a French widow lady, who had been &s;ettled there about a
year and a half. She was in but an indifferent &s;tate of health, and paid an
extraordinary price for her <PB N="200" REF="198"> apartment, that &s;he might
not be di&s;turbed with the noi&s;e of a family over her head. This was however
no objection to her landlord's reception of Charles, who, &s;he was told, was a
perfect &s;tranger, and had no attendants. Nor perhaps was it a bar to his
ac|commodation; for ladies, &s;ick or well, never &s;tart at a hand&s;ome young
fellow: that is to &s;ay, as they do at toads and beetles. The lady al&s;o
fir&s;t &s;ighed, and then &s;miled, when her landlord added that the young
gentleman &s;eemed to be very unhappy, but that he was certainly a man of
&s;ome con&s;equence, and a mo&s;t elegant and comely figure.</P>

<PB REF="199">
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING, BESIDES A VERY EXTRAORDINARY CHASE, AND THE
DETECTION OF THREE ROGUES, AN APPARENT IMPOS|SIBILITY THAT THIS HISTORY SHOULD
END HAPPILY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES, as had been his intention, proclaimed him&s;elf to his
landlord as a painter, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to copy a few pictures, if
there could be any way of getting at them. The landlord told him that the very
lady who lodged in the fir&s;t floor had two very capital ones, and, he had no
doubt, would lend them with great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The reque&s;t was made to her, and &s;he returned for an&s;wer
that the gentleman might &s;ee the pic|tures, and, if then they were found to
an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, he was very welcome to copy them.</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, both the gentleman and the lady, though neither
knew why, were charmed at this in|cident of the pictures; for the lady had
heard of no|thing but the gentleman's pari&s;es, and particularly 
<PB N="202" REF="200"> of the beauty of his per&s;on, ever &s;ince he had come
into the hou&s;e, and he had an irre&s;i&s;tible curio&s;ity to &s;ee a
per&s;on as much &s;eque&s;tered from the world as him&s;elf, and for probably
as extraordinary rea|&s;ons. He therefore returned a proper compliment, and, at
a time perfectly convenient to her&mdash;that is to &s;ay, when &s;he had put
on a new cap, and other|wi&s;e prepared for his reception&mdash;he took the
liberty of paying his re&s;pects to her.</P>
<P>Neither Charles nor the lady would probably have made &s;o much
ceremonious preparation for this inter|view if they had fore&s;een how
intimately they were known to each other; for they had &s;carcely met when
&s;he exclaimed&mdash;for women's perception, as well as their tongues, is
always forwarde&s;t&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'Good heavens! Mr. Hazard!'</Q>&mdash;which he
an|&s;wered as emphatically, with 
<Q REND="inline">'God ble&s;s my &s;oul, Madame Combrie!'</Q> And
then recollecting that &s;he was &s;aid to be a widow, he felt a &s;ingular
mixed &s;en&s;ation of &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, which gave a &s;trange
embarra&s;&s;ed awkwardne&s;s to his manner, and prevented him from following
up his excla|mation with a compliment.</P>
<P>Whether this proceeded from an inclination to enquire after
Combrie, which the knowledge of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation forbid, I will not
determine.&mdash;Certainly <PB N="203" REF="201"> the lady cho&s;e to interpret
it in this light, for &s;he immediately &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'You look as if you would a&s;k for poor
Combrie, Mr. Hazard: he is no more. He had &s;carcely made me independant, when
I lo&s;t him; but I am ha&s;tening after him, and we &s;hall one day yet be
happy together.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles &s;oftened the conver&s;ation, declared him|&s;elf
heartily &s;orry for her lo&s;s, but begged &s;he would not dwell upon any part
of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which brought up the recollection of any thing that
pained her on remembrance.</P>
<P>She &s;aid &s;he was obliged to him, but &s;he had long &s;ince
learnt to be perfectly re&s;igned to all that could happen, and the
conver&s;ation of &s;uch a friend as he had proved him&s;elf, would be as
agreeable to her as it had been unexpected.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Combrie was in the communicative vein, our hero
&s;uffered her to inform him of the particulars relative to her affairs, after
the recovery of her fortune. What Combrie had written of his going to England,
was but a feint; for, embarking at Rouen, for Dunkirk, where he arrived in
&s;afety, he po&s;ted immediately for Bru&s;&s;els. From Bru&s;|&s;els, which
they con&s;idered as too public a place, they removed to Ypres; but, previous
to this, <PB N="204" REF="202"> Combrie took a journey to Am&s;terdam, and
there lodged their money. At Ypres they lived two years and a half in perfect
happine&s;s, and were ble&s;&s;ed with a daughter, who dying in the &s;mall
pox, her father, who had never had that fatal di&s;|temper, and who&s;e
attention to his darling child was not to be prevented, al&s;o fell &s;ick, and
took that di&s;order in &s;o dangerous a way as baffled every ex|ertion of art.
In &s;hort, in one week fortune left her deprived of a tender hu&s;band and a
beautiful infant.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'At the fir&s;t &s;hock,' &s;aid &s;he, 'I
thought I &s;hould not have lingered long after them. My con&s;titu|tion has,
however, been hitherto proof again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t grief that ever
attacked a human heart: but I am gradually declining, and in a few months,
perhaps weeks, &s;hall follow poor Combrie.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles warned her again&s;t giving way to unne|ce&s;&s;ary
melancholy; advi&s;ed her not to &s;eclude her|&s;elf from the world; gave her
every con&s;olatory advice within his invention, and concluded with the mo&s;t
fervent offers of his &s;ervices, in any way that &s;he &s;hould think proper
to command them.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, though &s;he had good rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;|ing
that her end was approaching, &s;he knew her <PB N="105" REF="203"> duty as a
chri&s;tian better than to accelerate it; and, to prove this, &s;he had
empowered a capital hou&s;e in Ghent to receive her money from the Dutch bank,
which, as &s;oon as &s;he had in her hands, it was her intention to pa&s;s over
to England, where, perhaps, the change of climate might re&s;tore her to
health: if not, &s;he &s;hould have done her duty, and could then die
contented.</P>
<P>Charles greatly approved of her plan, and as he really felt
extremely &s;orry at the pro&s;pect of parting with a lady whom he had formerly
&s;o e&s;&s;entially &s;erved, and who&s;e ca&s;e made her &s;tand &s;o much in
need of friend&s;hip and con&s;olation, he manife&s;ted great anxiety in this
bu&s;ine&s;s. For one thing, he determined to recommend her to the tender care
of Mrs. Marlow; and, in &s;hort, though it was im|po&s;&s;ible to attend her
him&s;elf, he &s;o laid out for her comfort and accommodation, that it gave him
no &s;mall plea&s;ure to reflect that having once &s;aved her fortune, he
&s;hould now, in all probability, &s;ave her life.</P>
<P>This was the benevolent employment, in a &s;trange country, of
that horrid wretch who, in his own, was repre&s;ented as a mon&s;ter of
iniquity; for all which he received numberle&s;s thanks, and many a grateful
tear from the generous widow.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="204"> One morning, as he waited on her to
communi|cate &s;ome new &s;cheme of plea&s;ure he had been con|triving for her,
he met on the &s;tairs a man whom he was confident he had &s;omewhere &s;een
before.&mdash;His &s;urmi&s;es were pre&s;ently realized into certainty, when
Madame Combrie informed him that the mer|chant had been ju&s;t with her, with
information that he expected one of his partners every day with the money.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are to know,' &s;aid &s;he, 'I ever was
par|tial to the Engli&s;h; and the&s;e merchants, who are of that country, are
the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and feel|ing men I ever knew. They are men of

liked; and then as to property and &s;e|curity, I need only again &s;ay they
are Engli&s;h.&mdash;In &s;hort, I believe I could not have got into better
hands than Bondham and company.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh gracious God!' exclaimed Charles, 'what do
you tell me? For God's &s;ake an&s;wer me: Was that Bondham I met on the
&s;tairs?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It was,' &s;aid the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then by heaven and earth you are ruined,
madam!' returned Charles. 'Forgive me, my dear lady, forgive me. I would not
give you a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s, not the <PB N="207" REF="205">
&s;lighte&s;t &s;hock, but you have not an in&s;tant to lo&s;e. You are in the
hands of villains. Stay, is there an attorney near at hand? Can a man be
arre&s;ted in Au&s;tria by the plaintive him&s;elf, for a debt contracted in
England?'</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, without any further elucidation, our hero left the
a&s;toni&s;hed Madame Combrie, enquired out an attorney, and lugged him along
to the hou&s;e of the&s;e merchants; but, alas! they came a few minutes too
late, Bondham and Co having all de|camped: and, after &s;ome fruitle&s;s
enquiry, it was a&s;certained they had taken their departure towards the
frontiers.</P>
<P>He returned to Madame Combrie, in company with the attorney;
told her that his &s;u&s;picions had been but too fatally confirmed; and begged
&s;he would in&s;tantly empower him to do her ju&s;tice: in which ca&s;e he
would immediately follow the&s;e mi&s;|creants, whom he well knew how to make
an ex|ample of.</P>
<P>He entreated the attorney to accompany him; to which he
con&s;ented, fir&s;t making an agreement that he &s;hould be well &s;atisfied
for his trouble: which only proves that attornies are attornies, all the world
over.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="206"> The gentleman of the law then drew up a
&s;hort in&s;trument, to give Charles &s;ufficient power to act, and the
landlord, and indeed half the town&mdash;for our hero had dealt about his
cur&s;es pretty hand|&s;omely in the &s;treet&mdash;accompanied po&s;t hor&s;es
to the door, at which Charles entreated Madame Com|brie to make her&s;elf as
ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible; for, added he, 
<Q REND="inline">'I once madam &s;aved your fortune, and I will
now retrieve it, or peri&s;h in the attempt.'</Q></P>
<P>He then huddled a few nece&s;&s;aries together, mounted his
hor&s;e, and, with the attorney and the guide, galloped away in the very track
of the fu|gitives. They lo&s;t them however for more than the la&s;t fifty
miles; but, coming to Am&s;terdam, found that they had actually received all
the money, and embarked but &s;ix hours before for Harwich.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never mind,' cried out our hero, 'we will
follow them.'</Q> So &s;aying, he was directed to a &s;kipper, who, at an
exorbitant price, &s;upplied them with a &s;loop, in which, by Charles's
direction, they ran, with a fair wind, under the &s;hore of a village, at the
mouth of the Colche&s;ter river. Then taking the attorney and the &s;kipper in
a po&s;t chai&s;e, they &s;topt &s;hort of Harwich, at the hou&s;e of a
magi&s;|trate, to whom Charles related his &s;tory; which was this: that
the&s;e men had defrauded him for|merly <PB N="209" REF="207"> out of a large
&s;um of money, for which tran&s;|action he had fairly hold of them in England;
but, he only wi&s;hed to make his claim an in&s;trument to re&s;cue from them a
&s;till larger &s;um, the property of a French lady, which, under fal&s;e
pretences, they had drawn out of the bank at Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice, who happened to under&s;tand &s;ome|thing of the
law, advi&s;ed him to arre&s;t them, as the fir&s;t &s;tep; after which, he
&s;aid, he would back our hero's preten&s;ions with his whole authority; and as
his pre&s;ence, added to talking big, might facili|tate the hoped for
&s;ucce&s;s, he ordered his carriage, and willingly &s;et out to accompany our
hero upon his laudable de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The reader &s;ees the&s;e men were the &s;windler formerly
&s;poken of, the bailiff who kept Charles's a&s;ylum for the unfortunate, and
his &s;ecurity. A|gain&s;t the &s;ecurity he had a fair action of fifteen
hundred pounds, being the moiety of what had been forfeited. Again&s;t the
&s;windler he might go for the whole, and al&s;o again&s;t the bailiff; and as
his bu&s;ine&s;s was to tamper with them as much as po&s;|&s;ible, he &s;ent an
expre&s;s for three &s;eparate writs, which kept him, though the utmo&s;t
expedition was u&s;ed, upon the tenter hooks of fear and expectation, le&s;t
his prey, in the interim, &s;hould e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="208"> Before they had proceeded a &s;ingle mile
on the way, they &s;aw a po&s;t chai&s;e at an alehou&s;e door, with a man
watering the hor&s;es. Pre&s;ently Charles recognized Bondham, by the &s;ide of
a chai&s;e. He now called to the po&s;tillion to &s;top, and pretend there was
&s;omething the matter with the carriage: thinking it would be more difficult
to &s;urpri&s;e them &s;eparately than together. At the &s;ame time he begged
the magi&s;trate would drive &s;lowly on, and pa&s;s them, &s;o that they might
be caught between two fires, for they had an officer behind each of the
carriages. This was happily executed. Charles's &s;peaking to tho&s;e in the
other carriage was not at all &s;u&s;picious; for it only &s;eemed mere
curio&s;ity from one, which the other &s;atisfied. At the &s;ame time he hid
his face, and otherwi&s;e kept him&s;elf completely from a di&s;covery, which
indeed was not difficult, for the others &s;u&s;pected no &s;nare.</P>
<P>At length our hero had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the three
gentlemen enter the chai&s;e; which done, he got out, pretending to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;etting the carri|age to rights. The Flemi&s;h attorney and
po&s;tillion were al&s;o on their guard, and, as the other chai&s;e drew near,
the latter, with great dexterity, left his work, and unhor&s;ed his fellow
driver in an in&s;tant, and then ran to the heads of the hor&s;es, by which 
<PB N="211" REF="209"> time the attorney at one door, and Charles at the other,
held their pri&s;oners in &s;afe cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>Pretending not to know Charles, they called out, 
<Q REND="inline">'What do you mean to rob us?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No,' &s;aid the officer, who was by this time
come up, 'we want to prevent you from robbing other people: I have &s;eparate
actions again&s;t you to the tune of &s;even thou&s;and five hundred
pounds.'</Q></P>
<P>Nothing in nature is &s;o cowardly as a detected viliain. If he
have a pi&s;tol in his hand, he will fire it through de&s;peration; but, if he
be unarmed, no &s;linking cur ever tucked his tail between his legs in &s;o
da&s;tardly a manner.</P>
<P>The &s;windler cocked his hat, but that was all; the &s;ecurity
&s;weat, and the bailiff trembled from head to foot. By this time the
magi&s;trate joined them, who exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'God ble&s;s my &s;oul, I find it is fir&s;t
come fir&s;t &s;erved here. I have a de|mand upon the&s;e gentlemen. Come
mynheer, &s;tand forward.'</Q></P>
<P>The &s;kipper began to jabber &s;omething that no|body
under&s;tood but the attorney, who explained in French that he had a claim on
them for defraud|ing <PB N="212" REF="210"> the Dutch bank, which our hero, in
a mo&s;t in|&s;ulting tone, tran&s;lated for them into Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Next came a mock di&s;pute between our hero and the
magi&s;trates. Both claimed the gentlemen as their re&s;pective pri&s;oners,
who, in their turn, be|ginning to take a little courage, demanded to &s;ee by
what authority they were detained.</P>
<P>The officer &s;aid, archly, he had no &s;ort of objec|tion, if
they had a fancy for it, to expo&s;e them to every pa&s;&s;enger on the road;
but he thought, as they might be a&s;&s;ured they were nailed fa&s;t enough, it
would be the be&s;t way to go forward to his wor&s;hip's, where every thing
would be properly explained to them. 
<Q REND="inline">'In &s;hort,' added he, 'here are the red tails,
and you may depend upon it I &s;han't let you out of my &s;ight till you are
&s;afely lodged in Chelmsford jail. I did my bu&s;ine&s;s fir&s;t, and if his
wor&s;hip wants you up afterwards, upon other affairs, that's none of my
concern: thou&s;ands are &s;erious things, and my mind won't be ea&s;y till I
have fairly &s;hopped you.'</Q></P>
<P>Several hor&s;emen and others being &s;een at a di&s;|tance, the
pri&s;oners con&s;ented to go to his wor&s;hip's, where a very &s;erious
examination pa&s;&s;ed. The <PB N="213" REF="211"> Dutch emba&s;&s;ador's name,
and many others of very high authority, were bandied about with great free|dom.
At length, there being, in fact, no po&s;&s;i|bility of exhibiting a ju&s;t
claim on the part of Ma|dame Combrie, our hero contented him&s;elf with getting
from them his original three thou&s;and pounds, upon undertaking, by virtue of
his power from that lady, that no further demand, on her ac|count, &s;hould be
made again&s;t them in England.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall not be able to edge in a word by and by upon &s;uch
paltry &s;ubjects, I will drop the&s;e three gentlemen in this place for ever,
by &s;aying that after this triumvirate came to Flanders, they entered into
trade at Ghent, and, under the ap|pearance of a con&s;iderable property,
negociated money matters, which they re&s;olved to carry on with &s;crupulous
hone&s;ty, in order to beget them a character, till an opportunity &s;hould
offer of &s;trik|ing one &s;troke for all. This they thought they could not
more &s;ucce&s;sfully practice than on a de|fencele&s;s widow.</P>
<P>Having &s;o laid their plot that it could not fail&mdash;nor
indeed ever be known, had not Charles &s;o un|expectedly come acro&s;s
them&mdash;they re&s;olved to de|camp, and, being arrived in England, avail
them|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">elves of a fraudulent
bankruptcy: fir&s;t &s;haring the <PB N="214" REF="212"> whole of their effects
in equal proportions. This however they knew they could not do, unle&s;s they
previou&s;ly came to a compo&s;ition with our hero&mdash;for, in his affair,
there was evidently fraud, collu|&s;ion, and con&s;piracy&mdash;which they had
no doubt but they &s;hould be able to do, through a third per&s;on, upon ea&s;y
terms. Fortune, however, ordained it otherwi&s;e, as we have &s;een.</P>
<P>As to what became of them afterwards, the &s;win|dler was one of
the fir&s;t of tho&s;e who were tran&s;|ported to Botany Bay, the &s;ecurity
died of poverty in a pri&s;on, and the bailiff, attaching him&s;elf to an
infamous pro&s;titute&mdash;who fir&s;t ruined, and then be|trayed him&mdash;at
length followed his honourable principal.</P>
<P>After many &s;incere acknowledgments to the
ma|gi&s;trate&mdash;with whom they &s;tayed all night&mdash;for his uncommon
attention and politene&s;s, our hero and the attorney re-embarked, after
agreeing with the &s;kipper to &s;et them a&s;hore at O&s;tend, which would
&s;ooner bring them to the relief of Madame Com|brie's &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>On the road, Charles let the attorney into his intention, as to
the report he &s;hould make of this bu&s;ine&s;s to the lady; at which
information, what|ever <PB N="215" REF="213"> it might be, he te&s;tified much
&s;urpri&s;e, and in|deed began to think the young gentleman was turned fool;
but, being convinced to the contrary, by Charles's following the di&s;covery
with a reward, he, from that moment, certainly had a very great re|gard for our
hero:&mdash;for he told him &s;o.</P>
<P>They found Madame Combrie in a much weaker &s;tate than &s;he
appeared to be in when they parted from her. She li&s;tened however to the tale
of their &s;ucce&s;s with more unconcern than our hero ex|pected,
which&mdash;for the reader knows he was de|termined now to impo&s;e upon
people&mdash;he explained to be this.</P>
<P>That they had overtaken the fugitives, as we have mentioned, and
that being in England, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain any legal
redre&s;s&mdash;for the matter did not amount to a robbery, they having
received the money by her own order&mdash;he had been under the unplea&s;ant
nece&s;&s;ity of coming to a com|po&s;ition, and of receiving three thou&s;and
pounds, in&s;tead of almo&s;t double that &s;um. 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank God you have recovered it, madam,' added
Charles, 'and let this narrow e&s;cape warn you in future how you tru&s;t to
&s;trangers.'</Q></P>
<P>He then di&s;played documents to the amount of 
<PB N="216" REF="214"> two thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty pounds; the
re&s;t, he &s;aid, having gone to defray different ex|pences, and recompence
that gentleman&mdash;meaning the Flemi&s;h attorney&mdash;for the extraordinary
pains and attention he had &s;hewn in the whole affair; fini&s;hing with a
mo&s;t florid eulogium on the genero|&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of this
benevolent lawyer, who had&mdash;&s;till like his brethren in other
countries&mdash;eaten, drank, and &s;lept well, &s;aid yes and no, and rather
puzzled matters than explained them.</P>
<P>Our hone&s;t attorney being gone, Madame Com|brie made a very
long and very grateful &s;peech, by way of thanks, to our hero. Towards the
conclu|&s;ion &s;he uttered the&s;e words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Seeing all this is the ca&s;e, that your own
&s;itua|tion is &s;o &s;traitened'&mdash;for Charles had told her every thing,
except indeed that he was in pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ity&mdash;'that I &s;tand in
need of a protector, and that I &s;incerely believe there is not a man upon
earth of &s;uch generous, &s;uch delicate, honour as your&s;elf, let me offer
you a right to call this money yours: a right I do not blu&s;h to tender: a
right that &s;hould Combrie look down and &s;ee us at this moment, he would
cheerfully &s;anctify; for he was good and benevolent, like
your&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="215"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Take care madam what you offer,' &s;aid our

<Q REND="inline">'Lookee, my dear Mr. Hazard,' &s;aid the lady, I
may not live, in which ca&s;e, who can this mo|ney &s;o worthily belong to as
your&s;elf? I hold it at pre&s;ent but as a tru&s;t:'&mdash;the poor lady

offer.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam,' &s;aid Charles, more &s;eriou&s;ly,
'you know my fatal devotion to a fal&s;e and ungenerous young

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PARSON IS OBLIGED TO GIVE
WAY TO THE DOCTOR.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING, at this tickli&s;h period, married my hero greatly, I
doubt not, to the di&s;appointment of &s;ome readers, I &s;hall leave him and
his &s;ick wife, who really &s;eem to be fit company for each other, and return
to England, from whence we have lately heard of a wedding in a very different
&s;tyle.</P>
<P>That I may be as &s;uccinct as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall take the
matter up earlier than when Mrs. Marlow left Annette &s;o highly in dudgeon,
and &s;o come roundly to that point which I mu&s;t tell the reader happened to
be a remarkably critical one.</P>
<P>The reader will readily recollect the conver&s;ation between Mr.
Ego and Mrs. Marlow, which, of cour&s;e, was only an echo of what continually
pa&s;&s;ed at Sir Sidney's, and contained a very incon&s;iderable part of
tho&s;e manoeuvres which Mr. Glo&s;s daily put in practice, to deceive the good
baronet.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="218"> He had however a much harder ta&s;k to
perform; for Annette, and even Emma, mu&s;t be &s;haken in their allegiance to
this king of their hearts, before he could &s;tand the &s;malle&s;t chance of
moulding them to his purpo&s;e. To do this, he watched all our hero's actions,
and, when he &s;et on foot his new&s;|paper, employed an agent to
purcha&s;e&mdash;virtually for him however&mdash;one of the &s;hares. This, it
is not difficult to divine, was the man who arre&s;ted him, and from whom he
obtained his liberty, upon the terms of his going abroad, which, had he not
been &s;o precipitate in propo&s;ing him&s;elf, would have been offered to
him.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who held this &s;hare of the paper for Mr. Glo&s;s,
appeared to be a great favourer of the &s;cheme, and was one of the la&s;t who
&s;eceded; both of which &s;teps were good policy, becau&s;e one en|abled him
to do the paper a great deal of private in|jury, and the other kept all its
&s;ecrets within his knowledge to the la&s;t moment.</P>
<P>When the paper was put down, the other daily prints began, as I
have already &s;aid, to be&s;patter our hero, who, after the bu&s;ine&s;s of
the challenge, that he might not be provoked by them, read no|thing they
in&s;erted. On that account, the follow|ing paragraph totally e&s;caped his
notice, which was <PB N="221" REF="219"> given to the public about four days
before Annette paid Charles that vi&s;it, the nature of which it is now my
bu&s;ine&s;s to explain.</P>
<Q> 
<P> 
<LABEL>PARAGRAPH.</LABEL></P> 
<P>We advi&s;e a certain baronet, with that warmth and intere&s;t
the nature of &s;o extraordinary a ca&s;e and his excellent character
de&s;erve, to look with every po&s;&s;ible caution to the &s;ecurity of his
amia|ble daughter's per&s;on, who, notwith&s;tanding her exemplary devotion to
the will of a tender father, may, neverthele&s;s, be &s;urpri&s;ed by the
machina|tions of a certain young new&s;paper adventurer, who, that his
mi&s;chievous brain may be always at work&mdash;having given over attacking
celebrated and e&s;tabli&s;hed public productions&mdash;is now turn|ing his
thoughts to a &s;cheme which, unle&s;s the parties are extremely wary, will
de&s;troy by force that dome&s;tic peace which he could not under|mine by
art.</P></Q>
<P>This paragraph, in the u&s;ual pompous &s;tyle, had &s;carcely
appeared when two or three &s;trange fellows were watching about Sir Sidney's
hou&s;e, and one was &s;een in the garden, but he made his e&s;cape over the
wall before the &s;ervant could come up with <PB N="222" REF="220"> him. To
&s;ay truth, Sir Sidney was not a little alarmed. Indeed Annette her&s;elf
could not help te&s;tifying &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; and, as to Emma, though her
&s;entiments were perfectly decided, &s;he kept them to her&s;elf; for &s;ome
freedoms Mr. Glo&s;s had, about that time, provoked her to take, drew from Sir
Sidney what amounted to almo&s;t a declaration of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her his
hou&s;e, upon a repetition of &s;uch liberties.</P>
<P>Until the up&s;hot of our hero's villanous &s;tratagem &s;hould
be known, Sir Sidney propo&s;ed that they &s;hould all go into the country for
a few days, and the place made choice of was Richmond, where they had been
repeatedly invited by an old friend of the baronet.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s having carried his point thus far, the
accompli&s;hment of his &s;cheme waited only for its <HI>coup de grace.</HI>
This was performed in the following manner.</P>
<P>As Annette was &s;trolling in the garden, to enjoy the &s;weet
&s;erenity of a moonlight night, and, not to hide the truth, to reflect on her
love for our hero, who now &s;he began to fear would never be hers, and, what
was wor&s;e, never de&s;erve to be hers, two men &s;uddenly came behind her.
Having taken <PB N="223" REF="221"> their mea&s;ures like adepts in their
bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he was completely prevented from either &s;truggling, or
alarming any of the family, and, in a very few mi|nutes placed between the
&s;trangers in a po&s;t chai&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen told her, with many a&s;&s;evera|tions, to
back the truth of their a&s;&s;ertions, that no harm was intended her; that
&s;he was only to be carried to Squire Hazard's hou&s;e, in London, who, Lord
ble&s;s his heart, for he was a worthy gentle|man, loved her better than he did
his eyes, and who, this orator &s;aid, it was his belief, intended to marry her
that very night, or &s;tick him&s;elf before her face.</P>
<P>Annette, with prayers and entreaties, begged they would carry
her back again. Her pride was deeply wounded at this poor, this paltry &s;cheme
of &s;tealing her from her father; and I mu&s;t own, and com|mend her for it at
the &s;ame time, that &s;he had, at that moment, a contemptible opinion of
Charles.&mdash;At the &s;ame time &s;he could not think that &s;he ran the
&s;malle&s;t ri&s;k as to her honour. She could ea&s;ily &s;ee &s;he &s;hould
be pur&s;ued, and, as her father and Mr. Glo&s;s were already upon their guard,
probably overtaken before they &s;hould arrive at the end of their journey.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="222"> With the&s;e ideas in contemplation,
Annette bore her misfortune with &s;omething like compo&s;ure, which &s;o won,
in appearance, on her conductors, that they began to plead the cau&s;e of our
hero very forcibly: not but they allowed it was a little hard to oblige a young
lady to do any thing again&s;t her will, even though it was to plea&s;e
her&s;elf. One of them pretended to be &s;o attached to her intere&s;t, that he
would tell her, Lord love her pretty face, all how the thing was, that &s;he
might better know what to make of matters when &s;he &s;hould &s;ee young
Squire Hazard. This well concerted fiction was nothing more than fancying what
a man would na|turally do who &s;aw, as it were, a young lady fly into his very
arms. He &s;aid, at fir&s;t &s;ight our hero would appear very much
a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing her. He would then pretend to &s;uppo&s;e the whole
bu&s;i|ne&s;s was her act and deed. 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay,' &s;aid &s;he, 'but he &s;hall not have
time to do that.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon that circum&s;tance they hitched their whole hope of
&s;ucce&s;s. If once Charles and Annette &s;hould begin to quarrel, every word
mu&s;t widen the breach; nor&mdash;that our hero might have as much
embarra&s;&s;ment as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;was the time pitched upon a &s;light
article in this ma&s;s of contri|vance. When could it be put in execution to
&s;uch good effect as at that moment when his mind was <PB N="225" REF="223">
perturbed, di&s;tracted, and broken to pieces, by re|flecting on his
&s;ucce&s;sle&s;s attempts at independancy, and when he was&mdash;which is
SHAKESPEARE's doubt magnified&mdash;flying from ills he had, to ru&s;h on
others that he knew not of.</P>
<P>All the&s;e matters, &s;o artfully conceived, &s;o nicely
combined, and &s;o certain in their effect, could not fail of producing exactly
what we have &s;een. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that Mr. Glo&s;s kept the po&s;t
chai&s;e in &s;ight all the way, for he mounted his hor&s;e the moment they
were fairly off, leaving word with a &s;ervant to tell Sir Sidney&mdash;who he
had taken care &s;hould be at &s;ome di&s;tance&mdash;that &s;eeking him and
explaining matters would take up too much time, but that Mi&s;s Roebuck was
&s;tolen away by Mr. Hazard, and he was &s;et out to follow them. He therefore
advi&s;ed him to come to town him&s;elf with all expedition, but not to be
under the lea&s;t appre|hen&s;ion, for he would re&s;tore the young lady, or
lo&s;e his life in the attempt. There was &s;omething a little awkward in not
taking the baronet with him; but there would have been ri&s;k in it, and the
&s;trong circum&s;tances which would afterwards come out, mu&s;t, he knew,
completely cover any inaccu|racy that, in a contrivance of &s;o complicate a
na|ture, was of cour&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="224"> When Annette got home, and Sir Sidney
heard her inveigh again&s;t our hero, and extol, in the highe&s;t terms of
panegyric, the genero&s;ity and gal|lantry of Glo&s;s, he ran over with
plea&s;ure. He al|mo&s;t pitied the poor de&s;perate devil, who had been put to
&s;o pitiful, &s;o unavailing a piece of villanous folly, &s;o ill contrived
that it defeated its own end. He launched out into the mo&s;t grateful flow of
warmth and energy in prai&s;e of Glo&s;s, and told his daughter that &s;he
could no longer refu&s;e to give him her hand. Grant, he &s;aid, that this
young mon|&s;ter had formerly made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart, it was now
as much a duty &s;he owed her&s;elf as him, to tear from her mind all traces of
a pa&s;&s;ion that could reflect on her only unworthine&s;s and di&s;ho|nour:
an affection for an unprincipled villain and a paltry coward.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing had &s;et Sir Sidney &s;o much again&s;t Charles
as his having refu&s;ed to accept the challenge; e&s;pecially after Glo&s;s had
reminded him that one of his ance&s;tors, in the reign of one of the Edwards,
had, at a tournament, fought a duel by the king's authority.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s was not yet however contented. He would &s;eek for
more proofs again&s;t Mr. Hazard.&mdash;The affection of &s;uch a young lady as
Mi&s;s Roe|buck <PB N="227" REF="225"> could not but be decided, let it be
placed ever &s;o unworthily. No pains ought to be &s;pared to re&s;tore ea&s;e
to &s;o gentle a heart: a heart that it &s;hould be the whole devotion of his
life to merit.</P>
<P>The next day he pretended to enquire about Charles, and found,
to his great a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;for &s;o he told Sir Sidney&mdash;that he
had &s;omehow or other got rid of the bailiff, and &s;lipt away to France.
Another day or two was taken to enquire into the particulars of this
tran&s;action. Every moment of all this time Sir Sidney was making preparations
for the wedding: Annette being yet wavering and unre&s;olved, till, on the
morning of that day when Mrs. Marlow called at Sir Sidney's, by the greate&s;t
good luck in the world, the bailiff and the two bail were found out, and
brought before Sir Sid|ney, to whom they offered to make oath that Charles was
gone abroad to be married, and pro|duced the bond as a corroboration of what
they a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Annette, without he&s;itation, now con&s;ented to the marriage;
to do which &s;he mu&s;tered up &s;o &s;trong a portion of re&s;olution, and
wore &s;uch ap|parent content in her features, that except now and then a
&s;igh, &s;he betrayed no &s;ort of repugnance be|fore company, as to what was
going forward.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="226"> Emma however was not even yet deceived;
but what could avail her feeble voice in a multitude?&mdash;that is to &s;ay in
mere rea&s;oning, for if &s;he had &s;poken out it would have been in
thunder&mdash;e&s;pecially pro|hibited as &s;he was from &s;peaking. It was on
this account &s;he de&s;ired Mrs. Marlow, while Annette was at the other end of
the room, to tell Charles 
<Q REND="inline">'that his enemy was now an Antaeus in the arms
of Hercules.'</Q></P>
<P>This the good lady did not under&s;tand, or could not remember,
otherwi&s;e it might have made &s;ome alteration in Charles's conduct. And now
came the moment, as Emma thought, for her to &s;tep for|ward. She gloried in
the opportunity, and the more her adver&s;aries approached to an ho&s;t, the
&s;tronger &s;he found her&s;elf again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Her grand coup de theatre, however, was for the pre&s;ent
po&s;tponed; for, at &s;ix o'clock on that very morning Annette was to have
been made a bride, it was the opinion of every one about her that &s;he would
never be married but to her grave. She was &s;eized with &s;o violent a fever,
accompanied by &s;o &s;trong a delirium, that her father, Lady Roebuck, three
phy&s;icians, and an apothecary, were fully of opinion &s;he could not live
till the canonical hour. <PB N="229" REF="227"> Mr. Glo&s;s however, to work as
&s;ecretly as po&s;&s;ible, did not fail to blaze in the papers with an account
of the wedding; no circum&s;tance being omitted to hyperbolize the &s;plendid
talents of the bridegroom, or the fortune, beauty, and accompli&s;hments of the
daughter of that truly patriotic and independant country gentleman, Sir Sidney
Walter Roebuck, the olde&s;t title of baronet in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Annette's illne&s;s, in compliment to Charles&mdash;though it
was no more than what had happened to him, in compliment to her&mdash;had like
to have had effects as dangerous as they were &s;udden. For a whole fortnight
nobody expected &s;he would reco|ver. After that time however, though &s;he
certainly exhibited tokens of convale&s;cence, yet her mind had been &s;o
rudely &s;hocked, as to leave the recovery of her intellects a very doubtful
bu&s;ine&s;s. They were at length &s;o far re&s;tored as to &s;adden into a
&s;ettled, placid melancholy, which left her a pale and mournful example of
&s;en&s;ible and un&s;haken con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s began now to be afraid that providence had
determined to defeat what he had defied the impui&s;&s;ant art of man to
de&s;troy. Yet, that nothing might be wanted on his part, he was indefatigable 
<PB N="230" REF="228"> to procure intelligence of our hero's motions; when, at
length, through Ego, he learnt of his marriage: Ego him&s;elf having been
informed of it by Mrs. Marlow.</P>
<P>Emma, finding that this marriage was no coun|terfeit, like the
re&s;t, began in earne&s;t to fear that all was over. To &s;atisfy her&s;elf of
the particulars, &s;he called on Mrs. Marlow&mdash;for now &s;he was
de|termined to keep no mea&s;ures&mdash;and was by her &s;hewn the letters from
our hero, by which &s;he plainly &s;aw he had fallen a victim to the arts of
Glo&s;s. Her heart bled for him. She perceived he had entailed mi&s;ery on
him&s;elf through the be&s;t pride and the noble&s;t honour that ever young man
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His ca&s;e therefore appeared to be de&s;|perate.</P>
<P>This however &s;he conceived ought, for the &s;ake of her young
lady, rather to accelerate than retard her mea&s;ures, which &s;he was now
re&s;olved to go about fully and fairly: e&s;pecially as, to give expe|diency
to them, &s;he had, through Mrs. Marlow, though unknown to that good woman,
made a &s;trong corroborative di&s;covery of one of tho&s;e facts through which
&s;he expected to carry her point.</P>
<P>Emma compared her&s;elf to General Monk; &s;ay|ing, 
<PB N="231" REF="229"> &s;he was determined to &s;trike no &s;troke till &s;he
&s;hould be &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Having now, however, collected her whole force into one point of
view, &s;he marched forward, and, without a &s;ingle ho&s;tile movement,
obtained a de|ci&s;ive victory.</P>
<P>In other words, Sir Sidney no &s;ooner heard what &s;he had to
alledge, backed with &s;uch convincing proofs, than no man upon earth ever took
&s;uch blame to him&s;elf, or conceived &s;uch an inveterate enmity to another
as he did to Mr. Glo&s;s. Indeed had not the di&s;covery Emma made involved
matters of &s;till greater importance, which were not yet quite ripe for public
examination, nothing could have re&s;trained the baronet from making of his
quondam favourite an immediate and mo&s;t &s;evere example. As it was, he
fairly inli&s;ted under General Emma, who, though &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould
not put her King Charles in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that throne Annette's
per|&s;on, yet &s;he was now &s;ure of re&s;toring the happine&s;s of that
kingdom Sir Sidney's family, who&s;e intere&s;t &s;he had &s;o dearly at
heart.</P>
<P>Poor Annette could enjoy none of this. A heavy languor pervaded
her &s;en&s;es. She received every thing that was &s;aid to her with beautiful
attention <PB N="232" REF="230"> and &s;olemn innocence, but gave no tokens of
col|lected comprehen&s;ion, except an&s;wering with a &s;igh any pa&s;&s;age of
tenderne&s;s, and now and then letting fall a pearly tear, with always&mdash;in
a faint, but &s;weet accent&mdash;the exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'I am &s;ure poor Charles is not a
villain.'</Q></P>

<PB REF="231">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS A REPENTANT SINNER, AND AN EXPIRING SAINT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As Emma's provident conduct, with her prin|cipal, General Monk,
in view, &s;eems to be an ex|ample worthy imitation, I &s;hall here &s;o far
follow it as to bring into one focus &s;uch objects as will conduce to an
elucidation of what to &s;ome may have appeared extraneous.</P>
<P>As however, early in this hi&s;tory, I di&s;claimed the idea of
introducing any thing foreign to the &s;ub|ject&mdash;indeed I mu&s;t have been
very ab&s;urd if I had introduced any &s;uch thing, for I have full matter
enough that hone&s;tly appertains to it&mdash;I will not give what I am now
going to explain the appellation of extraneous, but leading
circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>To effect &s;ome part of this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall now give a
brief account of Mr. Figgins, from the time he bid our hero adieu at Lyons, to
the period to which this hi&s;tory is advanced. The reader knows 
<PB N="234" REF="232"> that the gentleman I am &s;peaking of was heartily glad
to quit Charles, and return to England. To this however he was induced by a
motive, among others, of a better kind than has been yet explained. He was then
doing, or rather profe&s;&s;ing to do what we are told, by the highe&s;t
authority, is im|po&s;&s;ible; namely, &s;erving two ma&s;ters: and which, to
keep that incomparable idea in view, was, lite|rally &s;peaking, God and
Mammon. In &s;hort, his compacts with Charles and Mr. Standfa&s;t were very
oppo&s;ite things; yet, to the one he was obliged, and to the other willing to
adhere.</P>
<P>Mr. Figgins had not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered that however
vice may have its allurements, there is yet &s;omething &s;o pure, &s;o winning
in virtue and ho|nour, that a man &s;tands a chance of becoming a convert to
it, even though&mdash;like an advocate who pleads a cau&s;e he has no opinion
of&mdash;he &s;hould only maintain the &s;ubject by way of mere argument.</P>
<P>Thus it happened to Mr. Figgins, for he very often caught
him&s;elf in the very act of &s;eriou&s;ly admiring our hero, when his
agreement was to &s;erve his enemies.</P>
<P>He did not flinch, however, as we have &s;een.&mdash;He
di&s;charged his tru&s;t to the very letter of it, and <PB N="235" REF="233">
then claimed what had been promi&s;ed him, a living of two hundred a year, to
be added to his other income.</P>
<P>Finding however that Mr. Standfa&s;t's perfor|mance of this
promi&s;e depended upon the intere&s;t of Zekiel, who, as we have &s;een, upon
his acce&s;&s;ion to his fortune, left him fairly in the lurch, Mr. Figgins
began to &s;ee he had been a rogue for no-nothing. He could not,
notwith&s;tanding, blame Mr. Standfa&s;t, who&s;e lo&s;s was &s;till heavier;
yet he was determined to &s;hake of that tyrannical yoke which&mdash;in
con&s;equence of a few favours conferred on him in his youth, out of which, by
the way, the other had had his gleanings&mdash;Standfa&s;t had &s;o hea|vily
laid on his &s;houlders. To do this with perfect propriety was, however, no
ea&s;y ta&s;k, nor would he have been able to effect it, with any pro&s;pect of
real &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf, or advantage to others, if he had not thought
of a coalition with Emma.</P>
<P>To this Mr. Figgins was &s;timulated by various motives. Mr.
Standfa&s;t had unbent his mind a good deal before him, and particularly in an
al|tercation one day with Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, when &s;uch hints were thrown out
as obliged him, in his mind, to take a decided part on the &s;pot.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="234"> A few days after this he received
intelligence from Mr. Balance of the hand&s;ome way in which our hero had
&s;ettled on him a hundred a year.&mdash;This determined him to take an
<HI>active</HI> part. The con&s;ideration that all his dirty work had been paid
by a di&s;appointment, and that the very man he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to cheat had
conferred on him &s;uch an un|expected and unmerited benefit, worked &s;trongly
in his heart. It reproached him with being a ra&s;|cal; a de&s;picable, low,
&s;huffling villain. In &s;hort, like Harry Hot&s;pur's &s;tarling, nothing,
&s;leeping or waking, was dinned in his ears by his con&s;cience but &s;uch
opprobrious &s;ounds, till, at length, the con&s;lict abated, and he ta&s;ted
the plea&s;ure of feeling him&s;elf an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>To do our hero any thing like ju&s;tice, he &s;aw was a mo&s;t
tremendous ta&s;k indeed, and of this he &s;oon convinced Emma, who &s;aid it
was plain the at|tempt, and not the deed, would confound them.</P>
<P>The reader will admit that circum&s;tances, half di&s;clo&s;ed,
lead to &s;uch a maze of apparently differ|ent meanings, that the chances are
infinitely again&s;t coming at the truth, by pur&s;uing any one of them. No
wonder then they were frequently thrown out, and unable to proceed with
certainty to any thing further than what Sir Sidney was now acquainted 
<PB N="237" REF="235"> with, and which, as it related only to the downfal of
Mr. Glo&s;s, and our hero's reconciliation with the baronet, was but a trifle
in compari&s;on of what they were &s;ure, by patience and per&s;everance, they
might achieve.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to &s;ay the truth, they were willing to let Charles
go the length of his tether. There was &s;uch redundancy of goodne&s;s in his
mind, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould know the world
practically: that he &s;hould feel experience. They thought they could marry
him to Annette when|ever they plea&s;ed: but here indeed they reckoned without
their ho&s;t, though it mu&s;t be owned not without good &s;en&s;e; for nothing
could be &s;o unlike|ly as that he &s;hould take &s;o extraordinary a &s;tep,
though, as matters turned out, I hope the reader does not think it
extraordinary at all.</P>
<P>Thus then their plot rolled on, like a &s;now ball, till Annette
began to be actually in danger; for then it was found nece&s;&s;ary for Figgins
to act overtly towards Charles, in proportion as Emma ob&s;erved the &s;ame
conduct with Sir Sidney. For this purpo&s;e he called at Charles's
hou&s;e&mdash;for he was the &s;tranger of whom Mrs. Marlow &s;peaks in her
letter&mdash;with the news of his brother's dangerous illne&s;s, which 
<PB N="238" REF="236"> was no invention, but actually a fact; and, to con|firm
what is there imperfectly given, I now inform the reader that Ma&s;ter
Zekiel&mdash;to u&s;e the landlord's expre&s;&s;ion at the John of
Gaunt&mdash;began to rub off the ru&s;t of his ance&s;tors, by leaving the
world three days after the &s;porting accident, before &s;poken of; upon which
Mr. Tadpole took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at the Lady Dowager's de&s;ire, for the
elde&s;t &s;on, lawfully begotten by Lord Hazard, till he &s;hould arrive to
the age of one and twenty: and, in ca&s;e of his death, for the younger.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s, however, who could &s;ee as well and as far as
either Mr. Figgins or Mrs. Emma, took care, as we have &s;een, to defeat the
whole end of this friendly vi&s;it. It was however repeated the day after Mrs.
Marlow wrote to Charles, when Mr. Figgins explained him&s;elf as far as he
thought nece&s;|&s;ary, and, among the re&s;t, told the good old lady that he
had three hundred and fifty pounds belong|ing to the young gentleman, which he
wanted to remit him: which money, to &s;hew to what a de|gree Figgins was
become hone&s;t, was the very identical annuity, as far as he had received it,
which Charles had &s;ettled on him, and which he vowed to the Almighty, in the
pre&s;ence of Emma, he would not touch a &s;hilling of till he had, like a man
of <PB N="239" REF="237"> honour, confe&s;&s;ed his former conduct to Charles
him&s;elf, implored his pardon, and, by &s;ome wor|thy atonement, merited his
friend&s;hip.</P>
<P> Upon this &s;ubject he ince&s;&s;antly be&s;ieged Mrs. Marlow,
and indeed &s;o did Emma, till, finding they were real friends&mdash;for, as
Emma told her, 
<Q REND="inline">'he who gives money &s;eldom
feigns'</Q>&mdash;the old gentle|woman became as anxious to bring about this
recon|ciliation, as Figgins to de&s;ire it. But how was this to be done? Our
hero's proceedings had been &s;o &s;udden and extraordinary, that he had no
opportu|nity of writing till he was ready to come to En|gland, and then he
thought it unnece&s;&s;ary; for, le&s;t his wife &s;hould become weaker, they
packed up their alls, and began their journey in a day or two after their
marriage: &s;o that not one &s;yllable came from Charles to Mrs. Marlow, till
&s;he re|ceived the following letter from Roche&s;ter. 
<LETTER>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY GOOD MARLOW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I intended to have &s;urpri&s;ed you with my pre&s;ence;
but it cannot be. I am not how|ever &s;ick, except at heart; nor is my per&s;on
in <PB N="240" REF="238"> danger: on the contrary, the wi&s;hed-for com|petency
is already obtained. As however it is impo&s;&s;ible to come on to you, you
mu&s;t come, and that immediately, to me, for I want you in a ca&s;e where all
your attentive tenderne&s;s and &s;ym|pathy will be nece&s;&s;ary. I am &s;ure
I need not urge you further.</P>
<P> I have volumes to tell you, therefore you can know nothing
till we meet; only this, that I am married: &s;o Mrs. Glo&s;s has not &s;o
completely triumphed as perhaps &s;he imagines; for you &s;ee I can even write
her damned name with all the com|po&s;ure in the world.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Call at the Bell.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow, who had, though innocently, been her&s;elf the
cau&s;e of what our hero had done, was in a &s;it of di&s;traction at the
receipt of this letter.&mdash;She thought every door was now barred between
Charles and that which could alone procure his hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;he was found by Figgins, who, in vain,
admini&s;tered every po&s;&s;ible con&s;olation to <PB N="241" REF="239"> her.
She &s;aid &s;he was an ungrateful woman; a wrong-headed, impatient wretch;
who, in return for &s;aving her and hers from wretchedne&s;s and mi|&s;ery, had
wantonly, though heaven knew not wickedly, heaped de&s;truction on the head of
her be|nefactor.</P>
<P>At length, however, they both con&s;idered that to lo&s;e a
moment's time would be committing a real crime, while &s;he was only accu&s;ing
her&s;elf of an imaginary one. It was therefore determined that they &s;hould
both &s;et out in the &s;ame po&s;t chai&s;e, and that Figgins &s;hould begin
his attack on our hero's &s;en&s;ibility in the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Marlow, who
had &s;o much to &s;ay in his de&s;ence. Indeed they mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly
promi&s;ed to be each other's advocate, though both knew there was not a
tenderer nor more merciful heart upon earth; and this was a greater
con&s;olation to Figgins than to Mrs. Mar|low, for he well knew how &s;ublimely
our hero ex|celled in all noble and generous exertions, while &s;he was
convinced that this very &s;weetne&s;s in him would be her bittere&s;t
&s;orrow, for the readier he might be to forgive her, the more unwilling
&s;hould &s;he be to forgive her&s;elf; and indeed both of the&s;e reflections
were perfect in their kind, for one had been guilty of crimes which, to procure
peace of <PB N="242" REF="240"> mind, mu&s;t be pardoned and forgotten, whereas
the other was only an error, which ought to be re|membered, that it might not
be repeated.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now leave our hero's friend and hou&s;e|keeper on the
road to Roche&s;ter, and &s;ee how he him&s;elf came there, as well as explain
why he could not reach London. The matter will be under&s;tood when I &s;ay
that, having determined to vi&s;it En|gland, immediately after the wedding, he
and his lady &s;et out, by &s;hort &s;tages, to O&s;tend; for it was yet
po&s;&s;ible that it might be dangerous for her to &s;et her foot in France,
and it was his bu&s;ine&s;s not to do any thing that could give her the
&s;malle&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion. This journey was al&s;o taken as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible, for marriage had not, by any means, abated the good lady's
di&s;order: on the contrary, &s;he vi&s;ibly became wor&s;e every day, which
was not perhaps a little facilitated by a di&s;covery of our hero's trick, as
to the fortune.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the attorney, looking upon the tran&s;|action as a
kind of miracle, proclaimed it from one to another, till at length it came to
the lady's ears, who finding that very genero&s;ity performed by another of
which &s;he hoped to reap all the glory her&s;elf, grew&mdash;&s;o perver&s;e
is human nature&mdash;very unhappy at it. Not that &s;he repined at being
de|pendant <PB N="243" REF="241"> on &s;uch a hu&s;band, for &s;he &s;poke of
his greatne&s;s of &s;oul with a kind of adoration; but her tender heart melted
to think that &s;he could give nothing in return for &s;uch goodne&s;s, but
trouble, unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;orrow. That a perfect youth, rich in all the
gifts of nature, and ble&s;t with heaven's be&s;t endowments, &s;hould be fated
to drag on a life of &s;adne&s;s, and receive only the feeble endearments of
unavailing gratitude, when the willing and in&s;pir|ing love of the
hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t woman upon earth would be infinitely beneath his
merits.</P>
<P>Some other female con&s;iderations perhaps lent the&s;e a little
&s;trength. Mrs. Hazard was many years older than her hu&s;band: her illne&s;s
had not altered her per&s;on to her advantage&mdash;for &s;he cer|tainly had
been a very beautiful woman&mdash;and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he could
not render him that at|tention her wi&s;hes prompted her to, fini&s;hed her
wretchedne&s;s; a &s;ettled gloom pervaded her mind, and &s;he pined at heart
that &s;he could only give thanks where it would have delighted her &s;oul to
have be&s;towed worlds.</P>
<P>There was however a &s;tronger rea&s;on than any of the&s;e. Her
di&s;order had taken deep hold on her before &s;he &s;aw Charles, and when
&s;he &s;et out for England it had become a &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s. Our 
<PB N="244" REF="242"> hero therefore, before he took this &s;tep, had a
con|&s;ultation of phy&s;icians, who privately a&s;&s;ured him that whatever
was done could be con&s;idered only as an experiment, for that her end, though
it &s;eemed at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, evidently appeared but too certain. A
voyage to England therefore was by no means unadvi&s;able, for certainly they
had known change of air and a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea bring about ex|traordinary
cures, and that, if it &s;hould have the contrary effect, he would have the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of recollecting the integrity of his own intentions in a
bu&s;ine&s;s where fate at la&s;t was to decide.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hazard arrived at O&s;tend tolerably well, con&s;idering
her &s;ituation, and Charles, after re&s;ting two or three days, to find a
convenient ve&s;&s;el, and choo&s;e calm weather, handed her on board a &s;loop
bound for Dover. Their pa&s;&s;age however was ren|dered both tedious and
trouble&s;ome, by an altera|tion of the wind, which &s;uddenly chopt about, and
blew almo&s;t a gale. Charles was him&s;elf very &s;ick, but his wife's
&s;ituation was dreadful; on which he was congratulated by &s;everal
pa&s;&s;engers, who &s;aid they were &s;ure it would re&s;tore the lady's
health. Tho&s;e however who entertain this opinion are egre|giou&s;ly
mi&s;taken, for how can &s;training and lace|rating the &s;tomach be of
&s;ervice to it. I &s;hall not, at any rate, pretend to &s;ay farther on this
&s;ubject <PB N="245" REF="243"> here, than that it had on this good lady an
effect very different from that progno&s;ticated; for &s;he had &s;carcely
landed at Dover, after a pa&s;&s;age of &s;eventeen hours, when &s;he was
&s;eized with fainting fits, which followed one another, at different
inter|vals, for three days; after which, &s;he grew more equal in her
&s;ymptoms, being neither &s;o high nor &s;o low in &s;pirits.</P>
<P>In this equanimity of mind, &s;he thought &s;he could very well
proceed on her journey, and both &s;he and our hero flattered them&s;elves
that, after this cri&s;is of her di&s;order, it would take a favoura|ble turn.
They therefore &s;et out, making &s;hort &s;tages; or, as the po&s;tillion from
the &s;hip, who had been a &s;ailor, called it, trips.</P>
<P>At length the whole hopes of both Charles and his lady were
fru&s;trated; for &s;he had &s;carcely got into the inn at Roche&s;ter, when
&s;he was again &s;eized with her fainting fits, which continued in &s;o long
and &s;o alarming a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the wor&s;t con&s;e|quences were
greatly feared. Charles therefore wrote, as we have &s;een, immediately to Mrs.
Mar|low, till who&s;e arrival he became&mdash;as indeed he had been all
along&mdash;a tender and affectionate hu&s;band, a con&s;oling and
in&s;tructive companion, and, what was perhaps as much to his honour as either,
a <PB N="246" REF="244"> watchful and attentive nur&s;e:&mdash;and in this
&s;enti|ment I will in&s;i&s;t; for upon the &s;ame principle, in a &s;tate,
that the bu&s;tle of war is only nece&s;&s;ary in proportion as it promotes the
ble&s;&s;ings of peace, &s;o he is the greate&s;t man who can reli&s;h, after
the exertions of his public duty, in a &s;till more exalted degree, the
felicity ari&s;ing from dome&s;tic tranquil|lity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHERE THE READER WILL PAY A MELANCHOLY VISIT TO ROCHESTER
CATHEDRAL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN Mrs. Marlow arrived at Roche&s;ter, Mrs. Hazard was at the
la&s;t extremity, &s;o that the good old lady had little more to do than to
clo&s;e her eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hazard's whole conduct, throughout her illne&s;s, had been
touching and exemplary. Charles, though he did not love her with ardour, yet
loved her with a better affection than do nine hu&s;bands out of ten love their
wives. He found him&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a woman capable of making any
man happy, and with whom he had flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould pa&s;s a life
of &s;ober, rational delight. Again, &s;he was a kind of outca&s;t, like
him&s;elf, and their fortunes, by a &s;imilar chain of circum&s;tances, pointed
them out as fit partners for each other. It is not ju&s;tice then to &s;ay he
barely regretted her lo&s;s. He mourned it; hone&s;tly, &s;incerely mourned it.
Indeed &s;o much, that had he been given his choice <PB N="248" REF="246"> to
have had her re&s;tored to life, or Annette un|married, he would not have
he&s;itated a moment: &s;o much was genero&s;ity in him above
&s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>All that he could now do was to pay what re&s;pect was in his
power to her memory. He procured her to be buried in the cathedral; had a
&s;mall, but elegantly de&s;igned, monument erected over her grave; drew the
de&s;ign and wrote the epitaph him|&s;elf; in which was prettily introduced her
maiden name, her name by her fir&s;t marriage, and that which &s;he owned when
&s;he died; concluding that he, di&s;con&s;olate as he was, evidently
de&s;erved her le&s;s than either her father or her fir&s;t hu&s;band: for
&s;he had fled from him, to join them.</P>
<P>This image, poetically put, had, as the reader &s;ees,
capabilities, and Charles &s;o improved upon them, that his pen did not &s;hame
his conception.</P>
<P>The&s;e preparations took up nearly &s;even weeks; for Charles
would not &s;tir from the &s;pot till he had &s;een them fini&s;hed. The
exemplary conduct of &s;o re&s;pectable a young man, drew a crowd of friends
about him, and his lodgings were thronged with a number of the fir&s;t people
in the neighbourhood, who called on him with compliments of condolence, all
which he received with an unaffected dignity, <PB N="249" REF="247"> peculiar
to him&s;elf; till at length, having &s;ettled every thing to his
&s;atisfaction, he left Roche&s;ter with the title of The pattern for
hu&s;bands.'</P>
<P>All this train of circum&s;tances I thought it better to
di&s;patch at once, than to introduce Figgins be|fore I could give him a clear
cour&s;e.</P>
<P>When Figgins and Mrs. Marlow came within a mile of Roche&s;ter,
it was agreed that he &s;hould get out, and &s;aunter &s;lowly on, in order
that &s;he might break the ice for him. When &s;he came to the Bell, however, a
waiter was &s;ent with her to Charles's apartments, where being immediately
conducted to the lady's chamber, and finding her in the condi|tion I have
de&s;cribed, all ideas of any other cir|cum&s;tance or per&s;on upon earth
utterly fled from her. She thought no more of Mr. Figgins than of the man in
the moon. On his part, when he came to the inn, and, upon enquiry, found how
matters were, he felt that he could not have cho&s;en a more improper moment
than the pre&s;ent, and therefore determined to wait a day or two, or till he
&s;hould hear from Mrs. Marlow.</P>
<P>The next morning, however, Mrs. Hazard's death happened, and
when Mrs. Marlow had re|fre&s;hed <PB N="250" REF="248"> her&s;elf, after her
fatigues, with a little &s;leep, it came into her mind that Figgins mu&s;t be
at the inn.</P>
<P>It will readily be &s;een that this event, &s;ad as it was, had
abated Mrs. Marlow's anger again&s;t her|&s;elf; for, both our hero and Annette
being at that moment &s;ingle, the mi&s;chief &s;he had done was, as &s;he
thought, not now irretrievable.</P>
<P>It was a &s;ad moment to be &s;ure, but &s;till her tongue
itched to inform Charles that Sir Sidney was his friend, and that there was no
further ob&s;tacle, except poor Annette's unhappy indi&s;po&s;ition, to the
completion of his wi&s;hes. She could not however help throwing out a few
hints. This &s;he took an opportunity of doing that very evening, while Charles
was contemplating with &s;ober awful atten|tion the features of the poor lady,
who was then ly|ing in her &s;hroud. After a long and &s;ilent exami|nation of
that dreary &s;tate of &s;ad mortality; that &s;tate &s;o much courted, yet
&s;o little de&s;ired; an invo|luntary &s;igh e&s;caped him, and he uttered, 
<Q REND="inline">'There certainly is a re&s;emblance.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A re&s;emblance of what?' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow,
near whom he did not &s;eem con&s;cious he was then &s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh!' &s;aid Charles, &s;tarting, 'I had forgot
you <PB N="251" REF="249"> were here. What did you &s;ay?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' &s;aid &s;he, 'I a&s;ked you what you
&s;aid.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Upon my word I have forgot,' an&s;wered
Charles, 'but I know I was thinking that poor Annette here&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Annette!' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow, 'no, thank God,
&s;he is not here, nor in this &s;hocking &s;tate. An|nette! Lord &s;ir, what
made you think of Mi&s;s Annette?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mi&s;s Annette!' &s;aid Charles. 'Is &s;he
not&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'No that &s;he is not,' cried the good old lady,
'&s;he is not married, nor has &s;he been. It was a report, and a lie,
circulated by that devil Glo&s;s; and three days after I had written you word
of it, I could almo&s;t have cut off the very fingers that held the pen which
wrote &s;uch fal&s;e news. No &s;ir, thank God, that villain's reign is over;
Sir Sidney will beg your pardon, and you will be re|&s;tored to his
friend&s;hip.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles &s;tood in &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hment while he heard
the&s;e words, that he could not prevent her uttering them. The moment &s;he
had done &s;o, how|ever, he replied 
<Q REND="inline">'I hope all this may be found true, but it would
be indecent indeed, at pre&s;ent, to enter into it further. The mo&s;t
de&s;irable ex|pectation upon earth &s;hould not prevent me from doing my duty
here.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="250"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ay, ay, you again,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow. 'God
ble&s;s you for it. Will any body make me believe you won't at la&s;t be
perfectly happy? But I beg your pardon; I won't &s;ay another word; only this,
that poor Mr. Figgins has repented of all his villany, and you have not a
better friend in the world.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Figgins?' &s;aid Charles. 'Impo&s;&s;ible!'</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'In|deed &s;ir it is not,' &s;aid Mrs. Marlow,
'for he is now at the inn, and dares not come into your pre|&s;ence, for fear
you &s;hould not pardon him, al|though he would lay down his life to receive
for|givene&s;s at your hands.'</Q></P>
<P>She then produced the three hundred and fifty pounds, and began
to enumerate &s;o many proofs of his conver&s;ion, that Charles, in &s;pight of
him&s;elf, heard her to an end, and, when he had done &s;o, was upon the point
of di&s;patching a me&s;&s;enger to Figgins, to &s;ee him immediately; but Mrs.
Mar|low &s;aid it would be better to &s;end to him that night, but not to
appoint him till the morning, for he would be greatly affected at a propo&s;al
of being kindly received, and it would give a little time to prepare him for
&s;uch a meeting.</P>
<P>This was well put in by Mrs. Marlow, for it en|&s;ured 
<PB N="253" REF="251"> Figgins a kind me&s;&s;age, which mu&s;t inevita|bly be
the harbinger of a reconciliation.</P>
<P>The next morning, the breakfa&s;t things upon the table, and our
hero &s;itting thoughtfully, while he looked at a book which he could pay no
attention to, Figgins was u&s;hered in by Mrs. Marlow. He was beginning, with a
low inclination of the body, to make a &s;peech, when our hero, taking him by
the hand, interrupted him with 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Figgins, I beg I may not hear a &s;ingle
retro&s;pective word. If it can be po&s;&s;ible that you ever did me any ill
office, it mu&s;t have been through the blind influence of fal&s;e gratitude.
Sen&s;e of obligation to a ra&s;cal made you, perhaps, a little unju&s;t
your&s;elf. It is not till lately I have &s;een this, nor did you, very likely,
at the time. At any rate, my mind is now in no &s;tate for inve&s;tigations;
therefore, I beg our conver&s;ation may be on no topic that may divert it from
that object on which it is fixed.&mdash;For the re&s;t, I freely give you my
hand; and as I am &s;ure we ever had a regard for each other, let it in future
continue without interruption.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My incomparable friend exactly,' &s;aid
Figgins. Oh God, &s;ir, I wi&s;h you would permit me to give way to what I
feel. But I &s;uppre&s;s it. Yet I &s;hall never be happy till, by &s;hewing
you what I <PB N="254" REF="252"> have been, you &s;hall &s;ee what I truly am.
How could I?&mdash;but I have done. Only let me &s;ay that this is the
happie&s;t moment of my life, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t honourable.'</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome hours, Charles began to be greatly plea&s;ed at
having Figgins with him in this extre|mity. He had &s;uffered much poignant
unea&s;ine&s;s from reflecting that he was again without a &s;ingle friend.
Figgins had been the only man he had ever con&s;idered in that light. To him he
had given his unre&s;erved confidence. The lighter and more youthful of his
plea&s;ures had been pur&s;ued in his company, which, though perhaps not the
mo&s;t wor|thy, yet are uncea&s;ingly the mo&s;t endearing. In &s;hort, Charles
was melancholy, he was fatigued at heart by looking at nothing but unplea&s;ant
pro&s;|pects, real pain, and certain di&s;appointment. Not that his grief was
of that very apparent kind which pained every body who witne&s;&s;ed it. He had
no opinion of that &s;orrow which vents it&s;elf in cries and lamentations. His
was ardent and hone&s;t, but it was decent and manly. Thus, no friend ever came
more opportunely. With Figgins he could divide it: from him he could receive as
much con&s;olation as &s;uch grief was capable of admitting. There were
collateral con&s;iderations al&s;o that weighed in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Figgins
had known poor Combrie; had <PB N="255" REF="253"> a&s;&s;i&s;ted in obtaining
that very fortune, part of which Charles had now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and
it gave him a melancholy plea&s;ure to reflect that their returning
friend&s;hip would be cemented by &s;o awful a cir|cum&s;tance as Figgins's
performing the la&s;t mourn|ful rites to the poor decea&s;ed lady.</P>
<P>Thus con&s;oled, Charles con&s;ulted his friend in every &s;tep
he took, and they both became &s;o fond of their &s;olemn office, that no other
&s;ubject in|truded it&s;elf till after the day that hid the lady's cares
within the &s;ilent tomb.</P>
<P>Into that tomb however I &s;hall not de&s;cend, nor &s;hall I
&s;ay any thing more about it than that, from the moment it was completed to
Charles's &s;atisfac|tion, no &s;tranger ever vi&s;ited Roche&s;ter cathedral
but was particularly &s;hewn it, and told its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>From the interment to the time of their quitting Roche&s;ter,
Figgins took every opportunity of open|ing his grand battery, which he begged
he might preface with a hi&s;tory of him&s;elf, that his friend might &s;ee
what &s;ort of men there were in the world, and how ea&s;y it was to pa&s;s art
and wickedne&s;s for wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. He a&s;&s;ured Charles it would
take a burthen off his mind that never could be lightened but by a free
confe&s;&s;ion; that it was the <PB N="256" REF="254"> only lurking
unea&s;ine&s;s that remained; and, that once di&s;&s;ipated, he &s;hould never
again &s;uffer a &s;ingle moment's care; but, on the contrary, if he were
prohibited from the only means that could relieve his mind, his whole life
would be imbittered with the recollection that his happine&s;s was
incomplete.</P>
<P>At length, Charles growing more and more com|po&s;ed in his
mind, Figgins was permitted to &s;ay what he plea&s;ed, which favour obtained,
he began as follows.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear &s;ir, let me premi&s;e to you, never
take into your favour a man who&s;e origin or education has placed him in the
way of imbibing low or vulgar prejudices. In proportion as he has abi|lity
enough to think for him&s;elf, he will, from a captious con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
inferiority, fancy him|&s;elf in as natural a &s;tate of warfare with his
&s;upe|riors, as the crow does with the eagle, and will &s;upply in cunning
what he wants in &s;trength.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The&s;e being his affections, &s;hould an
opportu|nity &s;erve of mending his fortune, what are then his reflections?
Why, truly, that &s;uperior talents have done that for him which ungrateful
fortune neglected to do. He therefore transfers the obli|gation from him&s;elf
to his patron, and, with all <PB N="357" REF="255"> the low cunning of a
tricking &s;ervant, he will do his utmo&s;t to undermine that intere&s;t it is
his duty to promote. At the &s;ame time there are &s;ome few examples to the
contrary. Very few, how|ever; for he the world calls an up&s;tart is very
feldom indeed known to be grateful.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'How mu&s;t it be then when one lowly born, bred
in a &s;chool &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of every &s;pecies of wickedne&s;s,
&s;timulated to all the licentious prac|tices of broils and riots, and
practi&s;ed only in art and craftine&s;s, meets, at his &s;etting out in the
world, with a man who makes a point of chu&s;ing him out for this very
unluckine&s;s, and who means to u&s;e no part of his qualities but tho&s;e
which are to di&s;grace him in the eye of every hone&s;t man.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The&s;e are the portraits of Mr. Standfa&s;t
and my&s;elf! I think not my birth a di&s;grace, for my parents were hone&s;t.
I think not my education an unavailing one, becau&s;e I imbibed the &s;ame
prin|ciples of learning as I &s;hould have done at the be&s;t &s;chool; but as,
till I was almo&s;t a man, I mixed with none but the mo&s;t filthy vulgar, what
won|der if low cunning and &s;ubtle artifice made up my mind: for how, but by
the u&s;e of &s;uch talents, could I ever hope to ri&s;e in the world? And 
<PB N="258" REF="256"> then, as if a &s;ingle &s;park of virtue&mdash;which God
knows I hone&s;tly believed had no exi&s;tence but in idea&mdash;was likely to
check this worthy belief, in &s;tept Mr. Standfa&s;t, who a&s;&s;ured me that
no man, not born to a fortune, ever ro&s;e to one without certain talents,
which he called &s;uperior genius, but which I now denominate
ra&s;cality.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In &s;hort, I was to be placed about you as a
&s;ort of evil genius, and to give me as much power as po&s;&s;ible over you,
that is to &s;ay, as much hold as po&s;&s;ible on your genero&s;ity, you were
to &s;educe my &s;i&s;ter, and I was to overlook it; whereas I never had a
&s;i&s;ter, nor was that woman any more than a common creature of the town. In
&s;hort, all you &s;aw at my hou&s;e was a delu&s;ion, calculated for the
purpo&s;e of introducing you to me, and giving you fre&s;h apparent proofs of
Mr. Standfa&s;t's attach|ment, probably le&s;t you &s;hould di&s;cover the
vil|lany he happened then to be practi&s;ing again&s;t your father.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Figgins gave a copious detail of all the reader knows
already, relative to the mea&s;ures carried into effect by him and Standfa&s;t,
both a|gain&s;t Charles and his father; hone&s;tly &s;tating how far he took
&s;hame to him&s;elf in this bu&s;ine&s;s, <PB N="259" REF="257"> and &s;hewing
when he fir&s;t began to feel repug|nance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he did not omit a circum&s;tance which I have
already related; and having fairly opened our hero's eyes as to Glo&s;s, Sir
Sidney, and every one el&s;e, concluded with a&s;&s;uring him that the ba|ronet
was ready to take him heartily by the hand, make him a conce&s;&s;ion for his
unkind and unme|rited coolne&s;s, and beg to be admitted into his friend&s;hip
with more warmth than ever.</P>
<P> Figgins wound up this period pretty warmly, and then added, 
<Q REND="inline">'to which happy reconciliation it is needle&s;s
to &s;ay will &s;ucceed your marriage with Annette, from which
plea&s;ure&mdash;due alone to two &s;uch hearts&mdash;may I ever be excluded,

<P>To this &s;ucceeded a conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ting en|tirely of
remarks. The whole of Standfa&s;t's con|duct was taken piece meal, and
commented on, as far as it was con&s;i&s;tent with Figgins's compact with Emma,
and Charles plainly &s;aw that, but for that vi|per, both his father and mother
might have been alive, in all probability, at that moment.</P>
<P>As to Figgins him&s;elf, Charles did not choo&s;e to 
<PB N="260" REF="258"> let his opinion of him take date earlier than his
reformation, &s;ince which he was charmed with every action.</P>

<P>Sir Sidney and his family were by this time in Warwick&s;hire.
Nothing however, hard as his in|clination &s;purred him, could induce Charles
to pay his re&s;pects to the baronet before he di&s;charged his debts in
London. He panted to find him&s;elf once more a free man in his own country.
Sending Mrs. Marlow therefore before him, who&s;e pre&s;ence was particularly
wi&s;hed&mdash;for more than one rea|&s;on&mdash;by Emma, our hero and Figgins
vi&s;ited all the quondam proprietors of the impartial new&s;|paper, and paid
off their demands; nor did they beget a little con&s;ternation among them by
&s;aying that the cau&s;e was now taken up in &s;o &s;pirited a manner, that a
public print would &s;hortly come out, which mu&s;t be the inevitable
de&s;truction of all the re&s;t; for it would expo&s;e their partiality, their

<P>So far did they carry this, that hand bills were immediately
di&s;per&s;ed, holding out, in &s;uch fea&s;i|ble terms, a plan for the
de&s;truction of the&s;e diurnal locu&s;ts, that private terms of conciliation
came to them from two or three of the mo&s;t vulnerable, which they, to foment
the matter &s;till more, pub|li&s;hed in a &s;econd hand bill.</P>
<P>At length, having enjoyed a complete laugh at them, and been
joined by the town, they went into the country, and left them &s;weating with
&s;u&s;|pen&s;e.</P>
<P>The meeting between Charles and Sir Sidney was truly affecting.
The noble candour of the ba|ronet, the manly hone&s;ty of his
&s;elf-accu&s;ation, had in it a dignity of &s;oul highly admirable. He thought
nothing a conde&s;cen&s;ion which could &s;erve to a&s;&s;ure his young friend
how deeply he felt the recollection of his former &s;lights and &s;u&s;picions;
nor did he &s;pare either his penetration or his ju&s;tice, for hav|ing
admitted them, for a &s;ingle moment, to take place in his mind.</P>
<P>He declared he had ever held it as a maxim that 
<PB N="263" REF="261"> the mo&s;t glorious moment of a man's life was that in
which he acknowledged and repented of an error; and &s;o heartily was he, at
that in&s;tant, a&s;hamed of his conduct in relation to Charles, that he
&s;hould never have forgiven him&s;elf if it had not convinced him, at the
&s;ame time, of his valuable friend's unparalleled virtue: that it was the very
fire out of which that virtue came pure from the trial.</P>
<P>Charles, who endeavoured in vain to prevent this declaration,
had nothing for it but to palliate the blame Sir Sidney had &s;o hand&s;omely
thrown on him&s;elf. He &s;aid, under &s;uch delu&s;ive influence, it was
impo&s;&s;ible but he mu&s;t have fallen in with the opinion of others; for
that the very goodne&s;s of his heart would naturally incline him to credit
&s;o many well confirmed circum&s;tances. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e
who had attempted his downfal to &s;tick at nothing. They had their private
motives, of which it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;ee the extent; nay, as
their villanies involved &s;o many important circum&s;tances, a nice
inve&s;tigation of which was nece&s;&s;ary to effect their detection, it was
extremely difficult, as well as dangerous, for a friend, though ever &s;o
zealous, to offer any thing in his defence; while, on his &s;ide, con&s;cious
of the integrity of his <PB N="264" REF="262"> own motives, Sir Sidney mu&s;t
ultimately have con|demned him as deficient in every delicate feeling if he
appeared forward to deprecate anger which he had neither provoked nor
merited.</P>
<P>He &s;aid much more to this purpo&s;e, and con|cluded with
entreating Sir Sidney to believe that could he have &s;atisfied his own
&s;u&s;ceptibility, there was no moment during the whole time he had the
misfortune to labour under his ill opinion, that he would not have gone any
length to have effected a reconciliation. That reconciliation was now, he
thanked God, complete, without any conduct de|rogatory to the honour of either,
and it &s;hould be the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to pre&s;erve &s;o valuable a
friend&s;hip uninterrupted.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck received Charles as the &s;on of her decea&s;ed
friend. She found him ju&s;t what &s;he wi&s;hed, but not more than &s;he
expected. She thanked heaven that &s;o perfect a good under&s;tanding had
happily taken place, and declared, except a tinge of unhappine&s;s at the
&s;ituation of Annette, &s;he had not now another wi&s;h to gratify.</P>
<P>Emma did no more than receive her king, and render him her
allegiance. She told him he was <PB N="265" REF="263"> welcome; welcome as the
rain to MARCUS AU|RELIUS; though, like that, he came a little of the late&s;t:
but that it was not a time to talk, for, like that general &s;he had mentioned,

<Q REND="inline">"now they were refre&s;hed, they had yet a
battle to gain."</Q></P>
<P>A con&s;ultation on the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to be taken was
now propo&s;ed; previous to which how|ever Charles warmly entreated to &s;ee
Annette, with who&s;e melancholy &s;ituation Figgins and Mrs. Mar|low had
gradually acquainted him. He was told the &s;ight of her would greatly &s;hock
him; that &s;he knew nobody; that &s;he was continually buried in profound
meditation; and yet there was a di&s;tinc|tion in her manner of noticing
tho&s;e who were near her: if it could be called noticing them; for &s;he
te&s;tified le&s;s melancholy when Emma was pre&s;ent than any other per&s;on,
except Mrs. Marlow, upon whom &s;he would &s;ometimes look and &s;igh.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh God,' &s;aid Charles, and &s;hall &s;uch
angelic &s;weetne&s;s be lo&s;t to the world! Does &s;he never
&s;peak?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never,' &s;aid Lady Roebuck, 'any thing but one
remarkable &s;entence, which we will not an|ticipate: you &s;hall hear it from
her&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="264"> Charles's curio&s;ity was now whetted to
its keene&s;t edge, and he mo&s;t &s;ervently entreated he might immediately
&s;ee her.</P>
<P>Emma undertook to enquire if it was a proper time, and returned
with information that &s;he was then lying a&s;leep, with her head on Mrs.
Marlow's lap. Charles begged he might &s;ee her in that &s;itu|ation, which
would take off, in &s;ome degree, the &s;hock of his fir&s;t interview, and
afterwards, leaving her undi&s;turbed, he &s;hould be more calm, and better
prepared to bear a &s;econd.</P>
<P>This being agreed to, they all repaired to a draw|ing room,
where the beautiful in&s;en&s;ible lay on a &s;ofa, reclined in &s;leep, in the
exact &s;ituation that Emma had de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Charles devoured her lovely form with his eyes. It was the
Annette he had &s;een covered with inno|cent confu&s;ion at Aix la Chapelle; it
was &s;he who tore his heart with apparently unju&s;t anger the night before he
left England; it was &s;he he had &s;een in &s;o many delu&s;ive dreams; &s;he
for whom he had vented &s;o many unavailing &s;ighs; &s;he his &s;oul adored;
&s;he for whom alone he wi&s;hed to live; &s;he whom he was doomed&mdash;though
now found&mdash;to lo&s;e for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="265"> The&s;e were the glowing ideas which our
hero felt, but dared not utter. It was Annette he be|held; and yet her pallid
cheek&mdash;which &s;poke at once her di&s;tre&s;s and
re&s;ignation&mdash;forced from him fir&s;t a &s;tarting tear, then a profound
&s;igh, and after|wards, in &s;pight of all his efforts, an exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh heavenly God, do I live to &s;ee
this!'</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words Annette &s;tarted from her &s;leep, looked
wildly round her, then upon the ground. then &s;ighed, then played with her
hair, then &s;tarting from the &s;ofa, walked towards the window, re|placed
her&s;elf on the &s;ofa, &s;ighed again, and then &s;ignificantly moving her
head, &s;he exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh no&mdash;I am &s;ure my poor Charles is not
a villain.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And is this the &s;entence I was to hear?'
cried Charles. 'And can my Annette think of me! In madne&s;s think of me!
Kindly think of me! I cannot bear it. No my life,' cried he, throwing him&s;elf
at her feet, 'your Charles is not a villain: he loves you tenderly; dearly
loves you; and would give his life to purcha&s;e for you a &s;ingle glimp&s;e
of returning rea&s;on. Look on me my Annette! Speak to me! She will
not!'</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>LAUDABLE DUPLICITY AND A MAD SCENE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE the&s;e matters were carrying on at Sir Sidney's, Glo&s;s
was occupied, or at lea&s;t appeared to be &s;o, in di&s;charging his public
duty, and giving mini&s;terial dinners. Nor did this great man dream, while he
fea&s;ted upon muffins and paragraphs for breakfa&s;t, in London, that a
&s;troke was meditating in Warwick&s;hire which all his influence, backed with
all his cunning, would be found ultimately in&s;ufficient to parry.</P>
<P>He knew of Charles's marriage, and therefore was not at all
&s;urpri&s;ed either that he &s;hould return and di&s;charge his
debts&mdash;for no man had it more clearly in his power than Mr. Glo&s;s to
a&s;certain that Charles was a man of &s;trict honour&mdash;or that he &s;hould
threaten to take vengeance on the venal herd of diurnal &s;cribblers; for he
al&s;o well knew that our hero was both capable of planning &s;uch a
ca&s;ti|gation, and re&s;olute enough to inflict it.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="268"> To &s;ay the truth, the nece&s;&s;ity he
&s;hould lie under, as he conceived, of learning our hero's mea&s;ures, and
being active in circumventing them, together with the pains he took to quiet
tho&s;e who feared they &s;hould &s;mart under the la&s;h that &s;eemed to be
preparing for them, and which their own fears mag|nified into &s;omething
wor&s;e than that they richly merited at the cart's tail, induced Mr. Glo&s;s
to over&s;tay his appointment with Sir Sidney, who, by the advice of
Emma&mdash;without who&s;e concurrence nothing of moment was now
undertaken&mdash;wrote him a letter, and gently upbraided him for neglect|ing
his private concerns, though, at the &s;ame time, it was impo&s;&s;ible, the
letter &s;aid, too much to ad|mire that public virtue which was the cau&s;e of
it.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Stupid dotard,' &s;aid Glo&s;s to him&s;elf, as
he read the letter, 'I have infatuated the old block|head.'</Q> What however
would he have &s;aid had he known that in return for the treachery by which he
had influenced Sir Sidney to write that unju&s;t letter to Charles, when in
France, Charles him&s;elf &s;tood at the elbow of Sir Sidney, and approved of
the ho|ne&s;t duplicity contained in the letter now written, as a &s;nare to
detect his villany.</P>
<P>In order to this detection, and indeed to the de|tection of a
great deal more, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to <PB N="271" REF="269"> tread on
very tender ground, the confederacy agreed that Charles and Figgins &s;hould
take up their re&s;i|dence at a di&s;tance from Sir Sidney's, that Emma
&s;hould appear gradually to waver in her &s;entiments, on the repre&s;entation
of Mrs. Marlow, who was to tell a long &s;tory of having left him, in
con&s;equence of improper conduct to her daughter. This, in particular, was hit
upon, as it would be taking the very tone Glo&s;s had him&s;elf often
&s;ounded.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;olutions, and a letter received from Mr. Glo&s;s,
informing Sir Sidney that he would wave all con&s;iderations of engagements
with mini&s;ters, offices, councils, and levees, to attend the more welcome
duties of love and friend&s;hip, induced the two friends to be expeditious in
taking their departure; previous to which, however, Charles earne&s;tly
&s;o|licited one more interview with Annette.</P>
<P>She had manife&s;ted uncommon inquietude ever &s;ince &s;he had
been &s;o agitated at the &s;ight of Charles, nor could all their endeavours,
though &s;he conti|nued perturbed and re&s;tle&s;s, induce her to utter a
&s;yllable, unle&s;s he was &s;hewn to her at a di&s;tance, which he had been
three or four times, by the ad|vice of the phy&s;icians. Upon one of the&s;e
occa|&s;ions &s;he cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'It is fal&s;e, that's not Glo&s;s:'</Q> and 
<PB N="272" REF="270"> upon another, &s;he uttered in a &s;cream, 
<Q REND="inline">'Hide your|&s;elf, hide your&s;elf in France:
they'll put you in pri&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>At length they kept him from her, and then &s;he began to be
inqui&s;itive concerning him. In one of the&s;e moods he appeared before her,
and, for a &s;hort interval, while &s;he cea&s;ed her loquacity, and was lo&s;t
in profound meditation, he looked on her with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s,
heaving an agonizing &s;igh, and &s;heding a burning tear. The &s;igh
at|tracted her attention, and, as &s;he vacantly regarded him, &s;he cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Who are you? If you were not lovely, like my
Charles, I &s;hould call you Glo&s;s. He &s;ighs, he &s;heds tears; but his
&s;ighs carry the contagion of a pe&s;t, and his tears are the tears of a
crocodile. Sir I have the be&s;t father in the world. He married me to one
villain, to protect me, as he &s;aid, from another. Is the vulture a kinder
friend to the lamb than the eagle? But &s;ee how people may be deceived! It was
only a deceitful mirror; a fal&s;e medium; for, &s;ir, ca|lumny is not content
with wounding, but poi&s;on mu&s;t follow the bite. But why wound
me?&mdash;Pity that exce&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s &s;hould inflict mi&s;ery. I
mu&s;t never &s;mile again, el&s;e I could laugh out to think that the be&s;t
wi&s;dom will &s;ometimes &s;ink <PB N="273" REF="271"> to the wor&s;t folly,
for Sir Sidney Roebuck is my father. I have two mothers, yet no mother at all.
They are both angels: one of them in hea|ven, as &s;ome think, and the
other&mdash;Oh! No man but my father could de&s;erve two angels. He is an angel
him&s;elf. I was right then to marry Glo&s;s. I was right to obey my father. I
will &s;a|crifice my life for him, but I won't &s;acrifice my un|der&s;tanding
for any body. Sir unhand me; there is not a word of truth in all you &s;ay. You
&s;oar above him! Grovel, lay pro&s;trate, like your &s;oul, in villanous
filth. You traduce him! Did all the fiends, your fellows, &s;urround me, did a
thou&s;and deaths await me, were I obliged to give you my hand in marriage, I
would aba&s;h you, I would &s;trike you to the &s;oul, I would chill you with
horror, and &s;ay&mdash;that my poor Charles is not a villain.'</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;he was &s;eized with &s;trong convul|&s;ions, and then
put to bed; after which re|cour&s;e was immediately had to medical
a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>The next day &s;he became more compo&s;ed, and, at intervals,
had &s;ome dawn of rea&s;on.&mdash;Charles however was carefully kept from her,
e&s;|pecially <PB N="274" REF="272"> as &s;he appeared in imminent danger,
which circum&s;tance al&s;o, out of tenderne&s;s, was carefully kept from
him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>PROVES THAT THE LANDLORD'S OBSERVATION, AT THE JOHN OF GAUNT'S
HEAD&mdash;THAT HUMAN CREATURES ARE LIKE BUCKETS IN A WELL&mdash;WAS WELL
FOUNDED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As there are a prodigious number of circum|&s;tances which I
mu&s;t now clearly, and therefore gradually, develope, I &s;hall regularly
bring for|ward &s;uch characters as may be u&s;eful to me in the pro&s;ecution
of this ta&s;k: and fir&s;t, Mr. Balance, whom I certainly did not intend to
celebrate as an hone&s;t lawyer upon the credit of one or two upright actions;
for I mu&s;t have been a novice indeed had I not known that the evidence ought
to be very &s;trong and convincing that could &s;ub&s;tantiate &s;o un|common a
fact.</P>
<P>Let it be known that Mr. Balance began to en|tertain a tolerable
good opinion of Charles earlier than many others of his friends; and it aro&s;e
from this circum&s;tance. When he received an order to grant Figgins that
annuity of a hundred pounds, <PB N="276" REF="274"> formerly &s;poken of, our
hero was certainly in the wor&s;t di&s;grace with him, and this matter
remaining unexplained for a con&s;iderable time, nobody was forwarder than Mr.
Balance to blame his conduct in the pre&s;ence of Sir Sidney; nay I que&s;tion
whe|ther Mr. Glo&s;s him&s;elf did him, as far as it went, more injury in the
opinion of the baronet; for even Emma could not con&s;ider him as intere&s;ted
in his affairs: but as it is the nature of goodne&s;s to enu|merate the errors
of others with reluctance, &s;o it is to feel the warme&s;t anxiety to atone
for its own.</P>
<P>So it happened with Mr. Balance. When Fig|gins called upon him,
not more to receive his three hundred and fifty pounds, which were due to him,
and which we have &s;een him &s;o hand&s;omely refu&s;e to appropriate to his
own u&s;e, than to &s;olicit his hearty concurrence in Emma's mea&s;ures, he
was &s;o charmed with Figgins's &s;elf-condemnation, and the brilliant
character he gave of his friend, that he very naturally a&s;ked&mdash;and
indeed the reader will a&s;k too&mdash;why he had not come to him &s;ooner.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een, however, that what Figgins and Emma were
agitating was of two great a magni|tude to be &s;lightly touched on; but a
circum&s;tance happening, ju&s;t at that time, which gave them 
<PB N="277" REF="275"> rea&s;on to believe that Mr. Balance would not only be a
very u&s;eful, but a very willing a&s;&s;i&s;tant&mdash;for I have &s;aid that
his foible, though an attorney, was to detect ra&s;cality&mdash;Figgins paid
him a vi&s;it, and, after an hour's conver&s;ation, that gentleman inli&s;ted
under Emma's banners.</P>
<P>Had not our hero decamped to France in that precipitate manner,
a few days from that period might have made him happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Annette; to achieve which enterprize, Figgins, as we have &s;een, called at
his hou&s;e. The nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps however to bring about that de&s;irable
event, if it &s;hould ever take place, requiring his pre&s;ence, they were
obliged to be deferred. He is now upon the &s;pot, and I beg the reader's
attention while I trace out tho&s;e &s;teps one by one.</P>
<P>Scarcely had Charles and Figgins &s;ituated them|&s;elves in
their new re&s;idence, when Mr. Balance called on them, with whom&mdash;in
company with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary per&s;ons employed on the
occa&s;ion&mdash;they proceeded to Hazard hou&s;e, and knocked very
peremptorily at the door.</P>
<P>Finding the Lady Dowager alone, Mr. Balance told her that he
came ve&s;ted with authority to re|&s;tore the rightful Lord Hazard to his
title and e&s;|tate, <PB N="278" REF="276"> which information the lady affected
at fir&s;t not to under&s;tand, and afterwards to treat with great contempt;
but being told that Mr. Tadpole was in cu&s;tody, and had made an ample
confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;eemed greatly &s;hocked. Catching however at every
&s;traw, &s;he endeavoured &s;till to &s;tem that tor|rent which &s;eemed ready
to engulph her, nor would acknowledge any thing; till at length, being told
that the &s;um of Mr. Tadpole's confe&s;&s;ion was that he had been legally
married to her ten years, that con&s;equently her &s;ub&s;equent marriage with
Lord Hazard was illegal, her children illegitimate, and, of cour&s;e, that no
bar &s;tood between Charles and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his title and
fortune, &s;he acted a part &s;omething in the &s;ame &s;tyle in which we were
&s;ometime ago &s;o amu&s;ed with the vagaries of Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y.</P>
<P>Now the fact was that Mr. Tadpole was not in cu&s;tody, nor had
he made any confe&s;&s;ion. He was only kept out of the way by one of Kiddy's
cute manoovres, as he called it, who, to be plain, hav|ing been &s;ometime an
acce&s;&s;ary, and at length a principal, in Emma's plots, &s;ugge&s;ted the
pro|pere&s;t mode of carrying this one into effect; for, &s;aid Kiddy, 
<Q REND="inline">'if we attack the rum &s;quire, he will be peery
and prevaricative, but if we whiddle a little to ma'am, though &s;he is as fly
as Satan, <PB N="279" REF="277"> guilt will fly in her face, the pearls will
trickle, and we &s;hall have her as &s;nug as be damned.&mdash;Lord forgive me
for uttering &s;uch a word.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Tadpole, as had been concerted, in due time made his
appearance. He bounced and flew about, but being convinced, by incontrovertible
documents, that he was completely di&s;covered, be|came at length tame, and
threw him&s;elf on our hero's mercy, who put a fini&s;h to the bu&s;ine&s;s, by
a&s;&s;igning Mr. Tadpole and his lady, for the pre|&s;ent, that re&s;idence he
had taken for Figgins and him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;uring them that though he
&s;hould enter into a &s;evere &s;crutiny of all their conduct re|lative to the
management of the e&s;tate, &s;ince it had been in their hands, yet, on account
of his bro|ther's children, the ju&s;tice he &s;hould be obliged to u&s;e,
&s;hould be tempered with as much mercy as the nature of &s;uch a ca&s;e would
admit.</P>
<P>Here let me, for the &s;ake of truth, relate a mo&s;t
extraordinary trait of &s;uperior female cunning. I have &s;aid that Mrs.
Tadpole&mdash;for we &s;hall call her &s;o in future&mdash;had her doubts as to
who &s;lept with her at Li&s;le, but that tho&s;e doubts had &s;ub&s;ided, and
that at length &s;he had fully believed it could be no other than Charles. Can
it be credited that &s;he was in&s;pired with hope, from the recollection of 
<PB N="280" REF="278"> this circum&s;tance, and that &s;he flattered her&s;elf,
&s;hould &s;he take a favourable opportunity of repre|&s;enting it privately, a
repetition of the crime might give her a power over him! What a pity that
Figgins, who thought, as Kiddy has it, ploughing with the heifer might work out
&s;omething for the general good, &s;hould undeceive her, which he did, and
&s;o render all her &s;chemes abortive.</P>
<P>The documents which were explained to Mr. Tadpole, I &s;hall now
explain to the reader. It will be remembered that Kiddy, on his return to
England, called on Mr. Standfa&s;t, with an inten|tion of giving up Mr.
Tadpole, but that he &s;ud|denly altered his re&s;olution, attached him&s;elf
to that gentleman, and gave up his benefactor. Kiddy knew of the marriage of
Mr. and Mrs. Tadpole, and it mu&s;t have been &s;omething of a very particu|lar
nature indeed, predetermined as he was to di&s;|clo&s;e it, that could prevent
him from doing &s;o.&mdash;The fact however is as I have related it, and it was
not till the nice train of circum&s;tances, con|ducted by Emma, carried into
effect by Swa&s;h and his daughter, and at length &s;upported by Figgins, had
properly worked upon him, that he wavered in his attachment; but, even when he
had done &s;o, nothing could be adduced again&s;t Tadpole but Kiddy's ip&s;e
dixit, which was grounded upon a <PB N="281" REF="279"> confe&s;&s;ion of the
gentleman and lady, during a &s;quabble, when they were in France, and when
they thought Kiddy out of ear-&s;hot.</P>
<P>Without collateral evidence therefore nothing could be done.
This Kiddy contrived to procure, and it was not long before he &s;u&s;pected
that he &s;hould get at it through a gentleman who, in a very importunate way,
would &s;ometimes call on Mr. Tadpole; for &s;ome hints that con&s;tantly
pa&s;&s;ed be|tween that worthy wight and his lady, after he was gone,
convinced Flu&s;h that he knew &s;omething of their private affairs.</P>
<P> One day, as this gentleman was de&s;cending the &s;tairca&s;e,
after a long and pretty loud conver&s;ation with Tadpole, the latter followed
him, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'You may make your&s;elf very ea&s;y, for I will
&s;end to you on Wedne&s;day by the po&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>This was heard by Kiddy from the butler's pan|try, into which
pantry, on the following Wedne&s;|day, he coaxed the footman, who was
entru&s;ted with the letter, and, after giving him, as he called it, his
do&s;e, he contrived to get the letter from him, under a pretext of looking at
the direction, and then exchanged it for another, which he had 
<PB N="282" REF="280"> previou&s;ly written, and which the poor footman, who,
as Kiddy knew, could not read, carried to the po&s;t-office.</P>
<P>Kiddy's letter was as follows: 
<LETTER>

<P> WE begin to be down upon them, the Lord be prai&s;ed. I
&s;hall tell you all how and about it to-morrow. Blow me, Mr. Figgins, if I

<P> As &s;oon as Flu&s;h was alone he broke open the other letter,
the cover of which was directed "To Mr. Skinks," and de&s;cribed his
re&s;idence in London. It contained the&s;e words. 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SKINKS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I have con&s;idered the matter, and really think you are
too peremptory. What I have pro|mi&s;ed is very hand&s;ome, and I will not
con&s;ent to a tittle more. If you think it will better &s;uit

enemy</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>TIMOTHY TADPOLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter, by the advice of Emma, was imme|diately conveyed to
Figgins, who, upon con&s;ulting with Mr. Balance, and putting different
circum|&s;tances together, began to have a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that he
him&s;elf had lent a helping hand in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Mr. Tadpole's
marriage.</P>
<P>Tadpole, as the reader knows, was an attorney's clerk. Be it now
known that Skinks was an attor|ney's clerk al&s;o, but having been guilty,
&s;ince the expiration of his article, of many nefareous practices, in the way
of his profe&s;&s;ion, he became, among many other rogues of the &s;ame
de&s;cription, well known to Mr. Balance, who happening ju&s;t at that time to
have him under his thumb, told Figgins that he had no doubt but he &s;hould
bring him to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Figgins con&s;ented to u&s;e Mr. Balance's authority as a
<HI>corps de re&s;erve,</HI> but thought it a good thing previou&s;ly to worm a
confe&s;&s;ion out of Shinks him|&s;elf. <PB N="284" REF="282"> For this
purpo&s;e he called on him, and pre|tended that he was commi&s;&s;ioned by
Tadpole to &s;ettle, once for all, their di&s;pute.</P>
<P>As Figgins familiarly mentioned the bu&s;ine&s;s of the
marriage, and ventured a few gue&s;&s;es at circum|&s;tances which might
probably belong to it, the other entered into the bu&s;ine&s;s candidly enough,
till at length Figgins's &s;u&s;picions were confirmed, and he was enabled to
&s;peak to it from his own knowledge; for he found it to be this.</P>
<P>When he was a bridewell boy, he was applied to by a gentleman to
carry him and another up the river, in one of tho&s;e barges which it is well
known the bridewell boys are very expert at rowing.</P>
<P>This expedition was to Wand&s;worth. It was conducted in the
night, and Figgins and another, who were let into the &s;ecret, under&s;tood
that it was &s;et on foot for the purpo&s;e of &s;tealing a young lady from a
boarding &s;chool, and that the friend of the gentleman who hired the barge was
to be married to her.</P>
<P>Being at that time anxious to get at as much of this &s;ecret as
po&s;&s;ible&mdash;probably from as hone&s;t a rea&s;on as that which now
impelled the conduct of <PB N="285" REF="283"> Mr. Skinks, he took the proper
methods, which he could do as cunningly as any body, to trace the conduct of
the parties, and &s;oon found where the marriage rites were performed.</P>
<P>This however accompli&s;hed, and concealment being no longer
nece&s;&s;ary, Figgins profited in no way, at that time, by the intelligence he
had been &s;o &s;olicitous to procure. It being now however &s;ingularly
&s;erviceable to his friend, he rejoiced that it had &s;truck him to u&s;e
it.</P>
<P>The reader is now ready to a&s;k why Mr. Figgins did not
recollect all the&s;e circum&s;tances at Li&s;le? To which I an&s;wer that
Tadpole's real name was Poach, which, when he fir&s;t conceived that very
hone&s;t intention of marrying his wife to Zekiel, he warily changed, that he
might be the le&s;s liable to a detection; and, as to their per&s;ons, he did
not &s;ee either of them at the time of the elopement but very imperfectly,
having never been in their com|pany but between the hours of eleven o'clock at
night and five in the morning.</P>
<P>Skinks however, who managed every thing, he recollected
perfectly well, both as to his name and his per&s;on, and the whole
bu&s;ine&s;s would long be|fore <PB N="286" REF="284"> have occured to him but
for the change of Poach into Tadpole.</P>
<P>Pretending to leave the negociation open be|tween Skinks and
Tadpole, he ha&s;tened to Mr. Ba|lance, who, fir&s;t impo&s;ing the mo&s;t
profound &s;i|lence upon Skinks, under pain of inflicting that puni&s;hment he
knew he had incurred, procured all tho&s;e documents, the &s;ight of which, as
I have &s;aid, &s;o completely &s;ilenced Tadpole, con&s;i&s;ting of a
cer|tificate of the marriage, an avowal of every thing under Skinks's
hand&mdash;which he readily gave upon reading Tadpole's letter&mdash;and a few
other nece&s;&s;ary matters.</P>
<P>Thus, having made my hero a lord, and given him a noble
e&s;tate, I &s;hall proceed to &s;ee whether he &s;tands a chance of ever
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that content without which, in the opinion of many, grandeur
and riches are only a &s;ub&s;titute for happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A GOOD DEAL OF BUSTLE, A HEROIC MOTHER, AND TWO OR THREE
NOTABLE DISCOVERIES.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As I flatter my&s;elf the reader will give me credit for a
complete knowledge of the power and effect of contra&s;t, it will not be
thought impolitic in me to bring forward our old friend Standfa&s;t, in
oppo|&s;ition to Mr. Balance. But, exclu&s;ive of this arti|ficial way of
introducing him, I have now a very natural one; for, as this hi&s;tory is
drawing apace towards its conclu&s;ion, it certainly could not have been
complete had I neglected to record, in the fulle&s;t manner, what became of a
character who had filled in it &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t and his lovely partner, &s;ince their mortifying
di&s;appointment on Zekiel's acce&s;&s;ion to his fortune, had figured away
with various &s;ucce&s;s. At one time they were rolling in &s;plendour, at
an|other frightened at bailiffs, till, having been con|cerned 
<PB N="288" REF="286"> in pharaoh banks, E O tables, lottery offi|ces, and
every &s;pecies of gambling, either brilliant or contemptible, according as
their circum&s;tances varied, they were at length reduced to the mo&s;t
mortifying poverty.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that time the change of the mini&s;try, as I have
already recorded, placed Glo&s;s&mdash;who, be it known, had never turned tall
on his old friends&mdash;in a re&s;pon&s;ible &s;ituation under government.
They now re&s;olved that Mr. Standfa&s;t &s;hould become a contractor, by which
means they very &s;oon re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed them&s;elves in tolerable opulence;
and here a very &s;triking reflection pre&s;ents it&s;elf, that ju&s;t as the
pupil, Charles, was compelled, by the lo&s;s of his fortune, to quit the worthy
employment of di&s;|pen&s;ing benefits, and relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of
the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed, the tutor, Standfa&s;t, &s;hould make a fortune by
admini&s;tering to folly and wick|edne&s;s, and oppre&s;&s;ing and grinding the
unfortunate and nece&s;&s;itous.</P>
<P> In this &s;ituation had they for &s;ome time conti|nued, when
Charles's &s;udden advancement to a coronet gave them to fear that &s;omething
was 
<Q REND="inline">"rot|ten in the &s;tate of Denmark."</Q> What
however they could not devi&s;e. Sir Sidney had certainly <PB N="289" REF="287"> taken careful mea&s;ures to appear perfectly indiffer|ent as to what
concerned Charles, but yet it was a moot point with Glo&s;s whether he was a
friend or an enemy; for, as Annette was carefully kept from him, and Emma, in
&s;pight of all her caution, could not help occa&s;ionally a little exultation,
his arts&mdash;e&s;pecially as it was nece&s;&s;ary to lay them on thicker than
ever, and as every body knew them to be &s;o many barefaced
fal&s;itics&mdash;were &s;o apparent that it really became an irk&s;ome ta&s;k
to have him about the baronet's family, although they were under the
nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o till they &s;hould be able to ac|compli&s;h their
<HI>coup de grace.</HI></P>
<P>About this time he received a letter from Stand|fa&s;t, which
informed him that the mini&s;try were again tottering. He therefore ha&s;tened
to town, and finding that the intelligence was but too true, a &s;cheme was
concerted between the&s;e amiable friends to embezzle certain monies, which
they well knew where to lay their hands on, and decamp into a foreign
country.</P>
<P>This however could not be effected without the previous
concurrence of certain men called clerks, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were
books and tallies, and other documents, by means of which alone they could
obtain a right to receive the&s;e &s;aid monies.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="288"> The&s;e documents they hoped to procure
through the influence of our old friend Viney, who had held a lucrative
&s;ituation under Glo&s;s ever &s;ince he fir&s;t came into office, but a
younger clerk, who happened to be a youth of honour and &s;pirit, and who had
very nearly been put out of office becau&s;e he had threatened to cha&s;ti&s;e
this old &s;inner, for mo&s;t &s;can|dalous conduct to his &s;i&s;ter, a
beautiful girl of thir|teen, conjectured by circum&s;tances what was going
forward.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, in attempting to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the
nece&s;&s;ary papers, Viney plainly found, by the &s;teps that had been taken
to prevent his intentions, that he was di&s;covered, and therefore, le&s;t he
&s;hould be involved in the guilt, went directly and gave in|formation
again&s;t his two friends, who, holding his conduct in equal di&s;tru&s;t, got
intelligence of his treachery in time, as they imagined, to ward off its
con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Neither Standfa&s;t nor Glo&s;s had been idle, for though they
could not accompli&s;h their grand point, they neverthele&s;s got together a
pretty round &s;um, which was at that moment depo&s;ited in Standfa&s;t's
bureau, and, as a <HI>coup de maitre,</HI> it was agreed that Glo&s;s &s;hould
force Annette from her father, with <PB N="291" REF="289"> an idea that after
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by means of marriage, or any other means, Sir Sidney would
not only be glad enough to make peace with them, but give his daughter a
fortune. The&s;e were his words when he propo&s;ed the matter to
Standfa&s;t.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'As to the boy Charles, he can never marry her:
but this is no time for inve&s;tigation. As to Sir Sidney, he will be glad
enough to come to terms, when the injury is in any other way irreparable. If
not, &s;he is the only woman I ever loved, and if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould
cloy that love, &s;he is very beau|tiful, and will always fetch a good
price.'</Q></P>
<P>I do not know that I have ever before made Mr. Glo&s;s &s;peak
without di&s;gui&s;e, and I almo&s;t hope, even now, that the reader will
di&s;believe that &s;uch a man could ever impo&s;e upon Sir Sidney. But nothing
can be clearer than that &s;uch conduct is not only in nature, but that it is
practi&s;ed every day, and practi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully. Goodne&s;s neither
knows nor &s;u&s;pects the &s;nares of villany, which covers it&s;elf in a veil
&s;o truly the hue of virtue, and which, in this in&s;tance, wore &s;o
completely that appearance to the eyes of Sir Sidney, that, till he &s;aw, in
his la&s;t vi&s;it, the &s;oul of Glo&s;s in its own filthy colours, &s;o free
was he from a practical know|ledge of what qualities vice was formed, he did
not <PB N="292" REF="290"> believe &s;o vile a human mon&s;ter could infe&s;t
the face of the earth.</P>
<P>The poor, fond, infatuated Standfa&s;t, on his part, was al&s;o
determined not to leave his partner behind him, and therefore, having
previou&s;ly agreed with Glo&s;s on a meeting place, ha&s;tened home, that,
like an obedient wife, &s;he might pack up her alls, and accompany him.</P>
<P>Reader, I do not think I have given thee a more &s;en&s;ible
plea&s;ure throughout this work than thou wilt now receive, when I inform thee
that he found his hou&s;e in confu&s;ion, his bureau broken open and &s;tript
of every thing, and the dear partner of his &s;oul decamped with his kind
friend Dogbolt!</P>
<P>Were I perfect in the duty of a hi&s;torian, I ought here to
de&s;cribe that hell, his mind; but as no reader will be &s;o unrea&s;onable as
to expect a de|&s;cription of what no words can expre&s;s, I &s;hall con|tent
my&s;elf with &s;aying that no reprobate ever &s;wore more volubly, no
dancing-ma&s;ter ever capered more curiou&s;ly, no bedlamite ever raved more
in|coherently. In the mid&s;t of this paroxi&s;m, he felt him&s;elf &s;uddenly
held down by two men, who thinking, probably, that a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat was
not &s;trong enough to hold &s;o violent a maniac, put him 
<PB N="293" REF="291"> on a pair of hand-cuffs, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of &s;everal others, carried him away in a hackney coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Glo&s;s, on his part, made the be&s;t of his way into
Warwick&s;hire, determined to carry off Annette, let what would be the
con&s;equence. He knew he mu&s;t act very craftily, and therefore took care
pro|perly to in&s;truct his emi&s;&s;aries, by one of whom&mdash;indeed the
very &s;ame gentleman who accompanied Annette to town in the chai&s;e&mdash;he
received intelli|gence that the young lady was much better, and now rode out
every morning, for an airing, either with Lady Roebuck, Emma, or Mrs.
Marlow.</P>
<P>When la&s;t Mr. Glo&s;s had been in Warwick&s;hire, he had taken
uncommon pains to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the good graces of this old lady,
who al&s;o ap|peared to pay him extraordinary attention: to &s;ay truth, an
attention that rather bordered upon in|qui&s;itivene&s;s, and which he would
have repul&s;ed if it had not &s;truck him that it might lead to the
ac|compli&s;hment of this &s;cheme, which, as his <HI>dernier re&s;ort,</HI> he
always had meditated.</P>
<P>He had now no doubts, could he get Annette at a di&s;tance from
home, through the connivance of Mrs. Marlow, but he &s;hould complete his
de&s;ign. <PB N="294" REF="292"> He thought he had di&s;covered that the old
lady's pa&s;&s;ion was avarice, for he knew that the whole &s;tory of her
having quitted Charles on account of her daughter was trumped up; nay he had
told her &s;o, and had got from her a reluctant confe&s;&s;ion that her
inducement to take that &s;tep was a wi&s;h to &s;helter her&s;elf comfortably
for the remainder of her life, at a di&s;tance from a turbulent young man, who,
though he had good qualities, would never do any good either for him&s;elf or
any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as he imagined, of &s;o much of Mrs. Marlow's
private &s;entiments, he thought he might, without danger, tamper with her a
little further, and, for that purpo&s;e, &s;ent a &s;ervant on hor&s;eback to
&s;ay generally, at Roebuck hall, that Mr. Glo&s;s propo&s;ed to pay that place
a vi&s;it in the cour&s;e of a few days, to which effect he al&s;o wrote a note
to Sir Sidney, but informed Mrs. Marlow privately, by another note, that he had
&s;ome mo&s;t particular bu&s;ine&s;s with her, which he mu&s;t explain that
even|ing, and would attend her wherever &s;he &s;hould ap|point. He took care
however &s;o to qualify that note, by introducing &s;uch circum&s;tances
relative to her, that it mu&s;t have told again&s;t her had &s;he either
partially or generally &s;hewn it to any one.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow made a great many difficulties, but 
<PB N="295" REF="293"> at length con&s;ented to meet him at the bottom of the
garden, which, in fact, &s;he did. He lamented his &s;ituation, &s;aid he
plainly &s;aw that Sir Sidney would go with the &s;tream, that &s;he had
her&s;elf al|lowed, in former conver&s;ations, that he was avari|cious, and
therefore &s;he mu&s;t &s;ee the temptation a coronet held out would not be
re&s;i&s;ted; that if he could be favoured with an interview with Mi&s;s
Roe|buck, without her father's knowledge, he was &s;ure he could lay &s;uch
convincing proofs before her of the propriety of his conduct, and the
impo&s;&s;ibility, even now, that &s;he could honourably become the wife of
that young up&s;tart, as he had no doubt would conquer all &s;cruples.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed Mrs. Marlow mountains if he &s;uc|ceeded, and at
length it was agreed that he &s;hould come upon them, as if by accident, the
following Thur&s;day, at an appointed &s;pot, before which time, Mrs. Marlow
told him, there would be no oppor|tunity, as Lady Roebuck would, till then,
accom|pany her daughter, and, on that morning, &s;he would have a particular
engagement at home.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e readers who are &s;orry to &s;ee this apparent
de&s;ertior of principles in Mrs. Marlow, will be more &s;o when they are told
that, on the following Thur&s;day, when &s;he was to ride out with Annette, 
<PB N="296" REF="294"> in order to keep the coa&s;t as clear as po&s;&s;ible,
that Mr. Glo&s;s might put his de&s;ign in execution&mdash;for, not to
di&s;gui&s;e the truth, he had, at a &s;econd inter|view, informed her of the
whole&mdash;the moment Glo&s;s appeared at a di&s;tance, &s;he &s;ent the
footman, for &s;ome purpo&s;e or other, back again: &s;o that there was no one
to oppo&s;e what was agitating but an old and almo&s;t helple&s;s coachman.</P>
<P>This being the &s;ignal agreed upon, Glo&s;s &s;prang forward,
and &s;eeing &s;ome hor&s;emen on a hill before him, which he took for his
myrmidons, he &s;oon came up to the &s;ide of the coach. Mrs. Marlow pretended
great &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing him, and, after &s;ome general conver&s;ation,
a&s;ked if he would not walk in. This he eagerly con&s;ented to, and the
coachman got down apparently to open the door.</P>
<P>Hearing hor&s;es, and &s;eeing men in great coats, he now
expected to find the coachman &s;eized, as had been agreed on, and the coach
box mounted by different men, to whom he had given &s;uch in|&s;tructions. What
then mu&s;t have been his a&s;to|ni&s;hment when he him&s;elf was &s;eized, and
told there was a warrant again&s;t him for murder.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A LITTLE RETROSPECTION, AN EXAMINATION, SOME HORROR, AND A
MOST MORTIFYING DISAPPOINTMENT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE reader having &s;een that Mrs. Marlow, in|&s;tead of acting
the treacherous part of a faithle&s;s &s;ervant, had a&s;&s;umed all the
dignity of a Spartan mother, it may not be ami&s;s for the &s;atisfaction of my
readers to &s;ee how &s;he became that mother.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be recollected that, in the &s;econd volume of
this hi&s;tory, I gave a hint that Emma had made a very &s;ingular di&s;covery,
on hearing the particulars of Mrs. Marlow's &s;tory. This di&s;co|very was no
le&s;s than that Standfa&s;t was the very clergyman by whom that poor lady had
been &s;e|duced, through the connivance of her aunt, when little more than an
infant.</P>
<P>She recollected to have heard that there had been a &s;imilar
accu&s;ation again&s;t him when fir&s;t he lived chaplain to Major Malplaquet,
and now, having <PB N="299" REF="297"> learnt the maiden name of Mrs. Marlow,
&s;he found that &s;he mu&s;t have been the innocent victim whom &s;he had
always under&s;tood he had treated with un|common cruelty. For the remainder of
her intel|ligence, &s;he received it fir&s;t from Figgins, and af|terwards,
through Swa&s;h, from Flu&s;h, who had lived with him at the time, and was in
the plot; but, as her communication with Kiddy had been ambiguous and guarded,
till &s;ome little time before the grand eclairci&s;&s;ement, &s;he had only
learnt that Glo&s;s was the precious fruit of that illicit amour in time to
make it the climax of her di&s;covery to Sir Sidney.</P>
<P>The reader recollects&mdash;which will illu&s;trate this matter
better&mdash;that while that clo&s;e intimacy &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between Charles
and Glo&s;s, Figgins was of the party, who, from &s;ome circum&s;tances that
came within his knowledge, learnt that Glo&s;s did not go to the Cape of Good
Hope. This induced him to think oddly of his connexion with Mr. Standfa&s;t,
but he did not find it worth his while to inve&s;tigate it till Emma went to
France, at which time he un|dertook to gather all the intelligence he could for
her at home, that, had it been nece&s;&s;ary to make her grand di&s;covery
there, &s;he might be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of facts of magnitude &s;ufficient
to have induced Sir Sidney to di&s;card Glo&s;s. Thus &s;he learnt, by a 
<PB N="300" REF="298"> letter from Mr. Figgins, three days before the
bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Aix la Chapelle, that Glo&s;s was the &s;on of Standfa&s;t,
but &s;he never divined the re&s;t, as I have ju&s;t &s;aid, till after
repeated conver&s;ations with Mrs. Marlow, and Kiddy's confirmation of tho&s;e
&s;u&s;pi|cions that aro&s;e out of it.</P>
<P>Thus, in different &s;tages of this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he u&s;ed
as much of this fact as &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary for her purpo&s;e. She told
Annette, in France, &s;he could bla&s;t Mr. Glo&s;s's hopes whenever &s;he
plea&s;ed; &s;he told Mr. Glo&s;s, before Sir Sidney, it would be &s;een WHO he
was; &s;he imparted the &s;ecret to Mrs. Marlow; and, finally, through the
proper and heroic feeling of that good woman, &s;he now held him her captive,
and was determined to give him up to that ju&s;tice he had &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly
laboured to abu&s;e.</P>
<P>This connexion of father and &s;on will naturally account for
the blended intere&s;t of Standfa&s;t and Glo&s;s, and al&s;o for the
congeniality of their &s;enti|ments: nay it will take off an imputation from
me; for as I may be almo&s;t accu&s;ed of repre&s;enting na|ture in too odious
a light, by bringing forward two characters &s;o &s;hockingly profligate, &s;o
the proba|bility of their being &s;o is con&s;iderably &s;trengthened when it
is found that the &s;ame blood ran in the veins of both; nay, &s;uch pains had
been mutually <PB N="301" REF="299"> taken that the emulation of the &s;on
might be worthy the in&s;truction of the &s;ire&mdash;for vipers and doves are
equally fond of their offspring&mdash;that it is not a&s;to|ni&s;hing Mrs.
Marlow &s;hould be &s;o &s;hocked with Glo&s;s, at the time Charles was
arre&s;ted, or expre&s;s that dete&s;tation which was in&s;pired by the
remark|able re&s;emblance of both his per&s;on and manner to tho&s;e of
Standfa&s;t.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the reader, did it never occur to Mrs. Marlow that
this very &s;ame Standfa&s;t was her be|trayer? There is great &s;ingularity in
this circum|&s;tance. Mrs. Marlow did not know Charles till he was nearly
ruined, and it cannot be forgotten that Standfa&s;t, giving up his &s;ituation
as an actor in this play of human life, had retired and become a prompter long
before that period. Therefore, not &s;eeing him on the &s;tage, &s;he did not
know that there was any &s;uch per&s;on employed in the theatre. Charles never
detailed his affairs, and though &s;he knew the &s;um of them, &s;he was
ignorant of many of the particulars till &s;he began to conver&s;e with Emma,
who, after all, was extremely cautious of letting her into &s;o much of them as
might impede any of her mea&s;ures. Therefore, it was not till after Charles
went to France the &s;econd time, and &s;he had had frequent conver&s;ations
with Emma and Figgins, that &s;he came at this truth, which, at 
<PB N="302" REF="300"> that time, Emma was the more anxious to inve&s;ti|gate:
finding it would be a matter of infinite im|port to a&s;certain that Mr.
Glo&s;s was the &s;on of Mrs. Marlow, by Standfa&s;t. And, on the other hand,
that I may make this matter perfectly clear, as Standfa&s;t went to Flanders
before the good lady in que&s;tion was married, he never knew her by the name
of Marlow. I could have &s;trengthened this elucidation, by noticing that
Standfa&s;t, like Atall in the play, had a different name, at that time, for
every different intrigue; but, as Mrs. Marlow knew him by his real name, I did
not chu&s;e &s;o to violate my hi&s;toric veracity, as to make out a ca&s;e by
the in&s;ertion of a fal&s;ity.</P>
<P>It now becomes nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate two or three
points, that I may give a clear &s;tage to &s;ome prin|cipal actors, who are
pre&s;ently to make their ap|pearance.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, in its place, and &s;ince hinted, that Kiddy had
been very much &s;hocked at &s;ome propo|&s;al or other made him by
Standfa&s;t; &s;o &s;hocked in|deed that it wrought in him an entire
reformation, and attached him to the intere&s;t of his patron's de|clared
enemy. I have al&s;o &s;aid that when Figgins went to expo&s;tulate with
Standfa&s;t, he, in the cour&s;e of that expo&s;tulation, became witne&s;s to
&s;uch a <PB N="303" REF="301"> &s;cene of altercation, between that gentleman
and Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, as begat &s;ome &s;u&s;picions in his mind of a very
horrid nature.</P>
<P>I have all along repre&s;ented Kiddy as a very weak, but not a
very wicked character. He had, from his low origin, his mean education, his
grovling propen&s;ities, been taught to con&s;ider Mr. Flu&s;h as a &s;uperior
genius; or, as he called it, geno; and thus he firmly believed that the
con&s;ummation of all human perfection was the accompli&s;hment of a
well-dige&s;ted fraud: but Kiddy always took care, as he phra&s;ed it, to draw
the line, le&s;t, as he cun|ningly ob&s;erved, the line &s;hould draw him.</P>
<P>Thus, were your wife or daughter to be &s;educed, your pur&s;e
&s;tolen, your reputation de&s;troyed, by treachery and cunning, Kiddy would
lend a help|ing hand with all the veins in his heart&mdash;his lan|guage
again&mdash;but as to going upon the highway, or being guilty of any other
di&s;hone&s;t act, which the law denominates felony, in that ca&s;e, no crown
lawyer ever knew better how to di&s;criminate than Kiddy. And this the reader,
when he recollects his out&s;et in life, will &s;ee he was taught by that
fir&s;t of ma&s;ters, experience.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;eeing men of the fir&s;t fortunes and abili|ties 
<PB N="304" REF="302"> con&s;tantly employing them to impo&s;e upon their
friends and neighbours, he only looked upon it as &s;elf-defence to arm
him&s;elf with the &s;ame arts; for, &s;aid Kiddy, 
<Q REND="inline">'In this here world I can't, for my part, &s;ee
why a man has not a right to be as bad as his betters.'</Q></P>
<P>Having therefore &s;uch an aver&s;ion to a halter, no wonder
that Kiddy &s;hould be &s;o affronted at a direct propo&s;al from Standfa&s;t
to commit an act for which, had it been di&s;covered, he mu&s;t have been
hanged; nor was it an unnatural tran&s;ition, fond as he had been of that fun
called human mi&s;ery, to &s;ee, all of a &s;udden, that he had delighted in it
a little too much; but as, turn which way he would, he was in &s;uch a
&s;ituation that he could not help impo&s;ing upon &s;omebody, he covered his
hypocri&s;y with the veil of religion, to rub off &s;lighter &s;ins, and
tho&s;e that bore too heavy on his recollection, he drowned in a dram; for,
&s;aid Kiddy, 
<Q REND="inline">'though every coge is a nail in my coffin, if I
do but re|pent before I am put into it, the grim jockies may &s;crew me up and
welcome.'</Q></P>
<P>To &s;hew however the prevalence of cu&s;tom upon human nature,
Kiddy very little con&s;idered that in the mid&s;t of his repentance, he was
acce&s;&s;ary to a fraud of great magnitude, namely, the keeping 
<PB N="305" REF="303"> Charles out of his fortune: nor would he, in all
probability, ever have taken any &s;teps to re&s;tore him to his right, had not
this laudable conduct, as we have &s;een, been &s;ugge&s;ted to him by Emma,
through Swa&s;h; nor even then, had not the mea|&s;ures to be taken involved in
them a po&s;itive nece&s;&s;i|ty of impo&s;ing upon Tadpole. This la&s;t
impo&s;i|tion however, being on the &s;ide of honour and vir|tue, Kiddy began
to feel, that however it might be clever to be a rogue, it was more comfortable
to be an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>The repentance of Figgins, as the reader knows, was better
confirmed, though, as there is weakne&s;s in every kind of wickedne&s;s, &s;o
it was certainly a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by finding, in con&s;equence of what dropt
from Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, that Standfa&s;t had him&s;elf perpetrated the very
crime which he had vainly per&s;uaded Flu&s;h to commit.</P>
<P>One moment more, and the reader &s;hall know what this crime
was, and al&s;o that it has been very often hinted to him.</P>
<P>It will be recollected that Standfa&s;t did not ac|company Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y into Warwick&s;hire, probably as he was grown remarkably hipped, 
<PB N="306" REF="304"> owing to his being led by his lady the life of a dog, as
Jerry Sneak calls it; and, as he was eternally tortured with his own
reflections, he might be afraid of gho&s;ts. I have &s;aid they were driven to
the verge of poverty, from which nothing could relieve them but the death of
Lord Hazard. I then &s;ay 
<Q REND="inline">'what joy to find Lord Hazard no more.'</Q> The
reader is upon the point of a&s;king 
<Q REND="inline">'By what means no more?'</Q> Again, I compare
Standfa&s;t to Barnwell, who murdered his benefactor, which indeed did
Standfa&s;t, or he mu&s;t have been foully belied; for, ju&s;t at the period to
which this hi&s;tory is now ar|rived, he was, in company with his &s;on
Glo&s;s, brought before Sir Sidney for that murder.</P>
<P>Here it will appear that there was good rea&s;on for managing
&s;o adroitly the delay, from the Mon|day till the Wedne&s;day, of Glo&s;s's
pretended inter|view with Annette. It has been &s;aid that there is no &s;nare
for bringing a man into a &s;crape like a woman. This proved to be the ca&s;e
both as to Standfa&s;t and as to Glo&s;s: differently however; one was betrayed
by adhering to a fiend, and the other puni&s;hed for a&s;piring to an
angel.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t was taken into cu&s;tody in town, through the
vigilance of Mr. Balance, but Glo&s;s was not to be found; therefore, when Sir
Sidney di&s;covered <PB N="307" REF="305"> that he was in Warwick&s;hire, it
required the inter|vention of a few days to procure the warrant that had been
granted again&s;t him, as well as to bring Mr. Standfa&s;t to that &s;pot where
the crime had been committed.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e Sir Sidney upon the bench, Charles, Mr.
Balance, and Figgins by his &s;ide, and Standfa&s;t and Glo&s;s brought before
him, on a charge of that murder for which we have &s;een them appre|hended.</P>
<P>Flu&s;h depo&s;ed what has been related concerning the
propo&s;al made him by Standfa&s;t; Figgins ex|plained the nature of his
&s;u&s;picions, and his con&s;e|quent conduct; and Mr. Balance &s;aid, from the
pains he had taken to inve&s;tigate the bu&s;ine&s;s, there could be no doubt,
as far as pre&s;umption went, but that the pri&s;oners were guilty.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And &s;o pre&s;umption is all you have
again&s;t us!' &s;aid Glo&s;s.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And this,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'upon the
evidence of a ra&s;cally &s;ervant, a fal&s;e friend, and a meddling
attorney!'</Q></P>
<P> Here they became turbulently in&s;olent, when the baronet,
commanding &s;ilence, and addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to Standfa&s;t, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'Unhappy man, I have a <PB N="308" REF="306">
witne&s;s that &s;hall &s;trike terror to thy very &s;oul; that,
pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;hamele&s;s as thou art, &s;hall &s;icken thee with
horror! See who enters at that door!'</Q></P>
<P>Had Standfa&s;t &s;een a &s;pectre, the &s;pectre of Lord
Hazard, he could not have been more appalled.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'By hell, it is all over!' &s;aid he to Glo&s;s.
'I thought the ra&s;cal had been dispatched.'</Q></P>
<P>This witne&s;s was John, who was tutored, as we have &s;een, to
refu&s;e the half guinea from Dogbolt, who was placed about Charles, at the
expre&s;s &s;tipu|lation of Standfa&s;t&mdash;not only that his ruin might be
more certain, but that the conduct of Mr. Figgins might be well watched,
le&s;t, as it happened in the ca&s;e of Kiddy, he &s;hould not be &s;taunch to
the in|tere&s;t of the confederacy&mdash;who intercepted all the letters, who
returned expre&s;sly to murder his lord, who did not &s;eem to arrive, however,
till two days after the murder was committed, who then, though callous to the
core, appeared to weep over his ma&s;|ter's corp&s;e, but who had &s;ince lived
in &s;uch a &s;tate of agonizing horror and remor&s;e, that he now came to make
an ample confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>John, after di&s;playing a natural and pathetic pic|ture of his
own penitence, told a mo&s;t horrid tale. <PB N="309" REF="307"> By large
bribes, and larger promi&s;es, he had been prevailed upon to murder his old
ma&s;ter. For that purpo&s;e he &s;tole into the hou&s;e, on the fatal
morn|ing, and took away the pi&s;tols which were hanging in Lord Hazard's bed
chamber. He afterwards &s;urpri&s;ed him in the garden; but he declared that,
when he looked in his poor, wronged, old ma&s;ter's face, which was now grown
pale and gha&s;tly, ow|ing, he had no doubt, to that di&s;tre&s;s which he
him|&s;elf had cau&s;ed, by &s;o often fal&s;ely accu&s;ing his &s;on, all his
re&s;olution for&s;ook him, and he had not the cruel courage to perpetrate the
deed. Standfa&s;t, &s;eeing this, ru&s;hed from a &s;hrubbery, where he had
concealed him&s;elf, le&s;t they &s;hould mi&s;carry; and, as Lord Hazard flew
to him for protection, and while he was in the attitude of lifting his hands
and eyes to heaven, that had mercifully &s;ent &s;uch a friend to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the unmanly, hardened, helli&s;h mon&s;ter cowardly murdered
him!</P>
<P>To this he added, that after the murder was ac|compli&s;hed, but
not till then&mdash;for Standfa&s;t was not fully &s;atisfied with his
&s;anguinary exploit till he had convinced him&s;elf, by a cautious
examination, that there was no &s;ymptom of returning life&mdash;the mur|derer
with great coolne&s;s placed the pi&s;tol that was di&s;charged clo&s;e to the
body, and put that which was yet loaded into the coat pocket, which is the 
<PB N="310" REF="308"> preci&s;e &s;ituation in which the reader will recollect
they were found.</P>
<P>John al&s;o &s;aid that, fearing he &s;hould be hanged for the
part he had taken in this &s;hocking bu&s;ine&s;s, he did, for &s;ome time,
whatever he was bid by Stand|fa&s;t, and con&s;ented to any wickedne&s;s that
was pro|po&s;ed to him; but his con&s;cience being at la&s;t hea|vily
loaded&mdash;for which he was often ridiculed, and &s;ometimes threatened, by
Standfa&s;t&mdash;he was upon the point of giving him&s;elf up to ju&s;tice,
when it &s;truck him to con&s;ult his old friend Flu&s;h, who, he under&s;tood,
had repented, and then lived a religi|ous life.</P>
<P>Flu&s;h, who, the reader knows, was at that time &s;eeking for
every kind of evidence to &s;erve Charles's cau&s;e, had known, John &s;aid, a
great deal of his former wickedne&s;s; and it was agreed that, at a proper
time, he &s;hould be called forward to atone for it, by a true confe&s;&s;ion
of all he knew concern|ing the murder. 
<Q REND="inline">'That confe&s;&s;ion,' added John, 'I have now
made, and it has taken &s;uch a load off my con&s;cience, that though all good
men mu&s;t hate me here, and I dare not expect mercy here|after, my poor heavy
heart will be &s;omething lighter, when I reflect that I have brought &s;uch a 
<PB N="311" REF="309"> villain to ju&s;tice, to revenge the murder of &s;o good
a ma&s;ter.'</Q></P>
<P>John's repentance Standfa&s;t all along had not only feared, but
he had determined to guard again&s;t its con&s;equences. He called him a
half-bred vil|lain; one who would certainly one day or other &s;queak.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, he con&s;ulted Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y upon the propriety of putting him out of the way. She, at a
proper time, to quiet him&mdash;which accounts for his exclamation ju&s;t now
to Glo&s;s&mdash;told him it had been done by Dogbolt; but indeed it was the
la&s;t thing Dogbolt would have done, or &s;he permitted; for as that gentleman
and lady had, for &s;ome time, determined to get rid of Mr. Standfa&s;t, &s;o
it did not appear to be their in|tere&s;t to keep any witne&s;s out of the way
who, &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary, might facilitate his being hanged.</P>
<P>The evidence being clo&s;ed, Mr. Standfa&s;t was committed to
Warwick jail for the murder of Lord Hazard, and Mr. Glo&s;s was told there was
not &s;ufficient proof again&s;t him to criminate him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>VEXATION UPON VEXATION, AND SOME PRETTY WRITING TO PROVE THAT
CATASTROPHES OUGHT TO BE UNHAPPY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOT a &s;ingle returning day had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the
reconciliation between Charles and Sir Sidney but brought with it &s;ome new
proof to the latter how egregiou&s;ly he had been impo&s;ed upon by Glo&s;s,
and what noble firmne&s;s there mu&s;t have been in the mind of our hero, who,
though he panted for an explanation, &s;corned to capitulate for it
di&s;ho|nourably.</P>
<P>But what were Sir Sidney's feelings when he found that the knave
who had thus practi&s;ed upon his credulity, was the &s;on of him who, by a
long, cool, deliberate &s;eries of unexampled villany, had fir&s;t ruined the
peace, and then de&s;troyed the life, of his friend and benefactor.</P>
<P>Oh how he was rou&s;ed! His good &s;en&s;e, his friend&s;hip,
his genero&s;ity, his every &s;eeling &s;eemed <PB N="314" REF="312">
in&s;ulted! And then the taunting impudence of that in&s;inuation concerning
his ance&s;try, which, as Sir Sidney indulged it, was &s;urely a right and
laud|able pride; &s;hewing by what means he had led him into a belief of the
mo&s;t gro&s;s and palpable fal&s;ity. He felt affronted and a&s;hamed, and was
at a lo&s;s to account for the motive that could have induced him to admit
&s;uch a creature into his conver&s;ation. He alike reproached him&s;elf for
having communicated with the viper, and thanked providence that had re&s;cued
him from its fangs.</P>
<P>Yet, what was all this compared to that thunder|bolt which
Glo&s;s, in his wanton, wicked lu&s;t of mi&s;chief, had now hurled at the&s;e
happy friends! The pe&s;tiferous breath, as it uttered the terrible words,
affected the hearers like a contagion, and it is but too true that he had the
in&s;ulting, trium|phant, unmerciful plea&s;ure to &s;ee both Charles and Sir
Sidney appalled and confounded.</P>
<P>As the reader is of cour&s;e full of anxious expec|tation, I
&s;hall now proceed to a nice inve&s;tigation of all that train of
circum&s;tances which led Mr. Glo&s;s to the knowledge of whom our hero had
married.</P>
<P>The reader will in&s;tantly recollect that Sir Sid|ney, 
<PB N="315" REF="313"> at the latter end of the fir&s;t book, &s;peaks of a
lady in the convent that Annette, when an infant, u&s;ed to call Mamma Le
Clerc. It will al&s;o ea&s;ily be remembered that Mr. Ingot gave Lord Hazard an
account of a Madmoi&s;elle Le Clerc, who had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with Sir
Sidney, and that this ac|count tallied &s;o exactly with the &s;tory of
Annette's mother, as to confirm both Lady Hazard and Lady Roebuck in an opinion
that it could be no other than her.</P>
<P>This Lady, as we are informed by Emma, left &s;ome jewels at Sir
Sidney's, but &s;he refu&s;ed, at the in&s;tance of one of the gentlemen who
accompanied her, to leave a packet of papers.</P>
<P>I will now be hone&s;t enough to declare that this gentleman was
no other than Combrie, and his rea|&s;on for advi&s;ing the lady not to leave
the papers, aro&s;e from a &s;ear le&s;t Sir Sidney &s;hould actually know who
&s;he was, and di&s;cover what were then her intentions. The &s;ame rea&s;on
induced him to prevail on her not to &s;ee the baronet in town.</P>
<P>The third per&s;on, who was, as I have &s;aid, de|puted by the
convent to receive the fortune, was our old friend Goufre, and it was from this
journey Combrie became &s;o well acquainted with all his af|fairs; 
<PB N="316" REF="314"> nay he had attended the young lady with a view to have
&s;urpri&s;ed the vigilance of the procu|reur, and have &s;ecured her fortune
when in En|gland, which circum&s;tance I al&s;o hint in the &s;e|cond volume;
but this, however, not being practi|cable, he had afterwards recour&s;e, as we
have &s;een, to other methods, which were attended with better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been related that, on Mrs. Hazard's mo|nument, at
Roche&s;ter, were placed her maiden name, the name of her fir&s;t hu&s;band,
and of that &s;he owned when &s;he died. This circum&s;tance, &s;u|peradded to
&s;ome intelligence obtained from one of the firm of Bondham and
Co.&mdash;indeed the very gen|tleman who afterwards went to Botany
Bay&mdash;con|firmed Mr. Glo&s;s's conjectures. He had however a great deal of
collateral intelligence: one of his emi&s;&s;aries having been con&s;tantly
&s;tationed by the &s;ide of our hero, who, had he attempted to return to
England, had in&s;tructions to lay him by the heels, either in Flanders, or on
his arrival, ju&s;t as might be mo&s;t expedient to a&s;&s;i&s;t the purpo&s;es
of Mr. Glo&s;s. Finding however that marriage had barred every pa&s;&s;age that
could lead to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Annette, he at fir&s;t made him&s;elf
perfectly ea&s;y, but when he heard of the death of Mrs. Hazard, and found that
the&s;e impediments were removed, he was obliged <PB N="317" REF="315"> to
ca&s;t about in his mind for fre&s;h matter, and, after &s;training his
ingenuity, and putting a variety of circum&s;tances together, taking a hint
from the name of Le Clerc upon the monument, he found out what I have no doubt
the reader will be heartily &s;orry for.</P>
<P>It will immediately occur to the reader that both Charles and
Figgins mu&s;t have been acquainted with all this matter, and yet it is very
certain they were not. The hi&s;tory of Annette was known only to five
per&s;ons; namely, Lord and Lady Hazard, Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck, and Emma.
Three of the&s;e did not know the whole truth. Thus, the name of Le Clerc was
never uttered to Charles nor Figgins as the name of Annette's mother, nor to
Sir Sidney as the maiden name of Mrs. Combrie; or, if it had, it probably would
not have induced any &s;u&s;picion of &s;o extraordinary and unlikely a
circum|&s;tance as this: for Le Clerc, in France, is as com|mon a name as Smith
is in England.</P>
<P>It al&s;o looks &s;ingular that Charles &s;hould not know the
private &s;tory of his wife, or that &s;he &s;hould be ignorant of his; but
&s;he is mentioned early in life to have been engaged in an intrigue, and it is
probable that &s;he thought youthful folly was not a proper thing for a
hu&s;band to be entru&s;ted with, <PB N="318" REF="316"> and as to him, I have
already noticed his remark|able delicacy towards Annette, as well as that &s;he
greatly commended him for it. Be&s;ides, had there been no other rea&s;on, the
&s;tate of Mrs. Hazard's mind and health mu&s;t have been &s;uch as to have
precluded the &s;malle&s;t likelihood of retro&s;pective inve&s;tigation
between them on &s;ubjects which could only have been developed through the
medium of great curio&s;ity and long intimacy, neither of which, as the reader
&s;ees, obtained in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and therefore nothing could be
further from the mind of either than that their union involved in it &s;o
momen|tous and my&s;terious a circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>During the journey that Emma per&s;uaded Sir Sidney to take into
France, it cannot be forgotten that every po&s;&s;ible enquiry was made by the
baronet concerning Annette's mother. He however only learnt, as I there &s;ay,
Ingot's &s;tory, and al&s;o that Mi&s;s Le Clerc had &s;hifted her quarters to
another convent, where they either could not or would not give any account of
her. The fact was, that as the elopement of a nun from a convent in France is
never, like a runaway from a boarding &s;chool in England, adverti&s;ed in all
the new&s;papers, but, on the contrary, kept as &s;nug as po&s;&s;ible, their
enqui|ries were looked upon as little more than imperti|nent curio&s;ity, which
will indeed be readily believed <PB N="319" REF="317"> when it is con&s;idered
that the convent of our lady of the a&s;cen&s;ion at Nancy&mdash;which was the
very place our travellers went to&mdash;had been pretty well &s;candalized by
the bu&s;ine&s;s of Madame Combrie al|ready, and therefore they were very
little likely to gather any intelligence from thence. Indeed the matter was
&s;o taken in dudgeon, that had Sir Sid|ney &s;tayed any con&s;iderable time,
and repeated his &s;olicitations, it is within po&s;&s;ibility that he might
have been con&s;idered as an acce&s;&s;ary to the fact of Combrie's procuring
the fortune from Goufre, and &s;o have been accu&s;ed of the very fraud which
he had been &s;o angry with Charles for committing.&mdash;Thus, as we have
&s;een, he came away from France no wi&s;er than he went there.</P>
<P>The reader will now &s;ee that, as the parties had no &s;ort of
communication with each other, it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould compare
notes; con&s;equently, no one of them, in &s;uch a length of time, had
en|tertained the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of what now, in one moment,
appeared to be beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>I have two or three times hinted&mdash;for I did not chu&s;e to
do any more&mdash;that Mrs. Combrie re&s;embled Annette, and there are
&s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in this work where the reader would very &s;trongly have
&s;cented <PB N="320" REF="318"> this game, if I had not opportunely put up
&s;ome other to divert his attention.</P>
<P>The blood hound Glo&s;s, however, has at length &s;ound it, and,
like all prey &s;tarted by &s;uch &s;angui|nary hunters, it leads us a tedious
cha&s;e, only to bring us to the knowledge of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>To leave every thing but plain narration, never was there
apparent happine&s;s &s;o da&s;hed by certain di&s;appointment. Every
comparative circum&s;tance &s;erved to confirm the fact, and mi&s;ery &s;eemed
now to confound the innocent with the guilty, till at length Emma her&s;elf,
after torturing probability by every ingenious and &s;ubtle inve&s;tigation her
inven|tion could &s;upply&mdash;all which, at an earlier period, perhaps I
&s;hould have given at length&mdash;was com|pelled to confe&s;s that there was
novelty in every thing relative to our lovers, for that, contrary to all
e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, they were born to be virtuous and unhappy.</P>
<P>I know not if I have introduced any thing into this hi&s;tory
&s;o truly pathetic as what it is now my reluctant duty to mention. The health
of Annette was only completely confirmed on that very day when the whole family
were convinced &s;he could not ble&s;s him for whom alone &s;he wi&s;hed to
live, and <PB N="321" REF="319"> &s;he was welcomed to rea&s;on only to be
plunged into mi&s;ery wor&s;e than madne&s;s. The delight that every one felt
at once more beholding the angelic inno|cence of her &s;oul conveyed by tho&s;e
benevolent &s;miles which now &s;poke her thankful joy, was da&s;hed with a
mixture of agony; &s;ighs were mingled with congratulations; tears choked the
utterance of plea|&s;ure; an univer&s;al gloom pervaded tho&s;e faces that fain
would have beamed with the willing &s;mile of grateful tran&s;port; and every
one, out of pity, ad|vi&s;ed a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of that wretchedne&s;s which
no one could conquer.</P>
<P>Too plainly did poor Annette perceive the mi&s;ery that the&s;e
inexperienced di&s;&s;emblers vainly en|deavoured to hide. Did &s;he a&s;k if
her father was well, yes was the an&s;wer, and a profound &s;igh fol|lowed it.
One began to give her plea&s;ure by an account of the reconciliation of Sir
Sidney and Charles, and interrupted the relation with a flood of tears. From
Sir Sidney, from Lady Roebuck, from Emma, from Charles him&s;elf, &s;he found
no better comfort; till, at length, her gentle mind was &s;o wounded and
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that &s;he &s;eemed, like an innocent victim, recovered from
one torture to be tormented with another, &s;till more ingenious.</P>
<P>However I may be partial to &s;portive writing, I 
<PB N="322" REF="320"> really think that, in this place, it would be both
impertinent and unfeeling to tantalize the reader, who now begins to think that
I have introduced a &s;et of characters which I hold up as models of vir|tue
and goodne&s;s, only to reward them with un|merited mi&s;ery and hopele&s;s
wretchedne&s;s; but I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall not be accu&s;ed of this
unnece&s;|&s;ary wantonne&s;s. I do no more than my duty, and again&s;t all
&s;uch cen&s;ure I &s;hall defend my&s;elf, by noticing that I undertook
nothing in this ta&s;k but to record facts, and if I leave the more amiable
part of my groupe of characters as mi&s;erable as tho&s;e who&s;e practice has
been knavery and villany, I &s;hall not, even in that ca&s;e, have de&s;erted
probability, nor have inculcated a u&s;ele&s;s le&s;&s;on of morality, &s;ince
to leave goodne&s;s in di&s;tre&s;s, is to enforce that highe&s;t of moral
duties, re&s;ignation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH CONCLUDES THIS HISTORY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Balance, who had been to town for the pur|po&s;e of &s;eeing
that the pro&s;ecution again&s;t Glo&s;s was properly carried on, was al&s;o
determined to &s;earch as deeply as po&s;&s;ible into the truth of this unhappy
affair, and, while he was thus employed, it happened that he was called upon by
a gentle|man who &s;aid he had very particular bu&s;ine&s;s with Sir Sidney, on
this very &s;ubject. With this gen|tleman Mr. Balance returned to
Warwick&s;hire, where he told Sir Sidney that, from what he could gather, he
feared the wretched tale was but too true.</P>
<P>It will be remembered that Charles knew, in the &s;outh of
France, a father Fitzgibbon, who told him that, in three years from that time,
he &s;hould have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in England, and would then call on him in
London. Our hero gave him a direction to Mr. Balance, who, he knew, would be
his man <PB N="322" REF="322"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB REF="323"><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="324" REF="324"> of bu&s;ine&s;s, and who, whether they were friends or
foes, would, of cour&s;e, forward any thing or per&s;on to him.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o be recollected that Mrs. Hazard's mo|nument at
Roche&s;ter, from which Mr. Glo&s;s re|ceived &s;ome of his intelligence, was
&s;hewn to all &s;trangers. It appears therefore fea&s;ible enough that Father
Fitzgibbon, in his way from Dover to the capital, &s;hould have &s;een it.</P>
<P>Father Fitzgibbon was the per&s;on now introduced by Mr.
Balance, who had &s;carcely exchanged the u&s;ual compliments with Charles,
when he admired by what remarkable and extraordinary means the &s;trange&s;t
di&s;coveries are brought about. In &s;hort, it appeared that he was the
intimate friend of Com|brie, and had received the greate&s;t obligations from
his family; that he had known him the whole time he meditated the elopement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Mi&s;s Le Clerc, and indeed was
the very friend who had equipped him with the dre&s;s in which he &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sfully per|&s;onated father Benedict. He had al&s;o connived at the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the keys, and lent him much other material a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
which he was the better enabled to do, as he was well acquainted with Goufre's
af|fairs, and then belonged to a convent at Dieu-le-war, about two leagues from
Nancy, where all intelli|gent <PB N="325" REF="325"> travellers to that part of
France have been in|formed there is &s;uch a convent made up of Engli&s;h,
Iri&s;h, and Scotch, and where they brew very good beer.</P>
<P>Fitzgibbon mentioned the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi&s;s Le Clerc's
journey to England, and of Combrie's pre|venting her from leaving the papers at
Sir Sidney's; adding, that tho&s;e papers had at length been entru&s;t|ed to
him, and that, as he under&s;tood they contained &s;omething of con&s;equence,
he had deferred 
<Q REND="inline">'&s;end|ing them by another,' to u&s;e his own
words, 'till he had an opportunity of delivering them him|&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aying, he gave the packet to Sir Sidney, who, in a moment,
knew and proclaimed that the hand writing was that of Annette's mother.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Then I am right, I find,' &s;aid
Fitzgibbon.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Too right,' cried one.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Fatal confirmation!' &s;ighed another.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Cruel de&s;tiny!' &s;aid a third.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Unheard of mi&s;ery!' exclaimed a fourth.</Q>
In &s;hort, the whole company exhibited &s;uch tokens of wretchedne&s;s, that
the Iri&s;hman cried 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, by my &s;oul, one would tink, by all
the&s;e de&s;tinies, and fates, and long faces, that I had brought over the
plague &s;ealed up in a letter. Upon my <PB N="326" REF="326"> honour and
con&s;cience I only di&s;charged the pro|mi&s;e I made poor Mrs. Combrie, four
years ago, who de&s;ired me moreover to add that every &s;yllable was
authentic; for in that paper would be found the lady's dying words in her own
hand writ|ing.'</Q></P>
<P>It occurring in a moment to every one pre&s;ent that if Mrs.
Combrie, four years ago, had given Fitzgibbon the dying words of &s;omebody
el&s;e, writ|ten in a hand which Sir Sidney knew to be that of Annette's
mother, Mrs. Combrie could not be that mother, every countenance immediately
under|went a total change, and what had been but the moment before certain
mi&s;ery, was now &s;weet ex|pectation. This was immediately evinced by a
volley of oppo&s;ite exclamations; at which Fitzgibbon exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'Pray good folks is it Bedlam I am in? By my
&s;oul, you &s;eem fir&s;t to be crazy, and after|wards di&s;tracted.'</Q></P>
<P>By this time Sir Sidney having ran over a part of what the
packet contained, found abundantly enough to convince him that there was no
farther bar to the happine&s;s of his daughter and our hero. To be brief, from
the papers, backed by what Fitz|gibbon had learnt from Mrs. Combrie, it
appeared that &s;he was certainly the Mamma Le Clerc for|merly 
<PB N="327" REF="327"> mentioned; for that Annette's mother had left her infant
daughter to her care, reque&s;ting &s;he would contrive to convey her to Sir
Sidney; which commi&s;&s;ion, through the medium of the nuns of St. Claire, as
we have &s;een, &s;he faithfully executed.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the very names of Mrs.
Combrie and Annette's mother bearing &s;o &s;trong a &s;imilarity, it is not at
all extraordinary that there &s;hould be this &s;trict friend&s;hip between
them, or that this a&s;&s;imilation of circum&s;tances &s;hould beget a
likelihood that they were one and the &s;ame per&s;on. The conduct of the two
fathers al&s;o is re|markably &s;imilar, and it would be extraordinary if it
was not. They were both bigotted catholics, and both puni&s;hed the
di&s;obedience of their daugh|ters, by &s;hutting them up in a convent; which
is only two in&s;tances out of two thou&s;and, or very likely ten thou&s;and,
upon the records of French nunneries, where the &s;ame crime has been
puni&s;hed in the &s;ame manner. We have heard that the fa|ther of Mrs. Combrie
died in England. They now learnt that the father of Annette's mother died in
Italy, after he had given the whole of his fortune to the church.</P>
<P>Fitzgibbon got the laugh completely again&s;t the company in the
cour&s;e of inve&s;tigating all the&s;e mat|ters. <PB N="328" REF="328"> He
&s;aid that, after all, they were &s;ad bun|glers at a di&s;covery; for, added
he, 
<Q REND="inline">'though you have only ju&s;t found it out, by my
faith you knew it well enough long ago:'</Q> and really, if it were not highly
indecent to get the laugh again&s;t the reader, I &s;hould be tempted to follow
the Iri&s;h|man's example, and indulge my&s;elf at his expence; for it
certainly ought to have occurred to him that each of the&s;e ladies had a
Chri&s;tian name, and, if it had, he would have know that the Chri&s;tian name
of Sir Sidney's Mi&s;s Le Clerc was Annette, and that of Combrie's Mi&s;s Le
Clerc was Araminta.</P>
<P>This very circum&s;tance of the difference in the Chri&s;tian
names, accounts for the whole, and &s;hews how much deeper fear impre&s;&s;es
us than hope.&mdash;Araminta was the name placed upon the tomb, and had it been
proper to have que&s;tioned Glo&s;s as to where he got his intelligence, his
an&s;wer mu&s;t have developed the whole my&s;tery: nay, le&s;t it &s;hould be
penetrated by the reader, it may be recollected that I took advantage of the
mi&s;take of Charles, who, ab&s;orbed in thought, called Mrs. Hazard An|nette,
by mi&s;take, as &s;he lay in her coffin.</P>
<P>Thus, I have gradually and naturally unravelled all that ma&s;s
of entangled circum&s;tances that &s;tood between our hero and the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his wi&s;hes. <PB N="329" REF="329"> I &s;hall not offer
on my labours a &s;ingle comment. If they embrace any important purpo&s;e, if
they incul|cate any u&s;eful moral, or &s;erve occa&s;ionally as ob|jects of
warning or imitation in the various pur&s;uits of life, I &s;hall have
exerci&s;ed a plea&s;ing duty, and &s;hall not fail to receive the thanks of
every man of rea&s;on and honour as my reward.</P>
<P>As Annette was recently recovered from &s;o &s;e|vere an
indi&s;po&s;ition, and as there were &s;ome other very &s;erious matters to
&s;ettle, it was agreed that her union with Charles &s;hould be deferred till
their ap|proaching grand fea&s;t, which was to be celebrated in about a
month.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take that interval to give a very &s;ummary account of
what became of the other characters which I have introduced into this work.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t actually did what Swa&s;h pretended to do. He
poi&s;oned him&s;elf in his cell, to prevent his trial. The interval between
his commitment to jail and his defrauding the hangman, exhibited a mo&s;t
frightful example to all villains. It con&s;i&s;ted of alternate fits of
intoxication. In &s;ome of the&s;e he execrated and bla&s;phemed; in others he
trembled with terror at the horrid images his fancy created 
<PB N="330" REF="330"> to torture him. One hour he howled in an agony of
apprehen&s;ion, in another raved in a paroxy&s;m of imprecation; till at length
his &s;on Glo&s;s, affectio|nate and con&s;iderate to the la&s;t, prevailed on
a com|mon friend to vi&s;it him, who, well tutored for the purpo&s;e, induced
him to &s;ave the di&s;grace that would be entailed on his memory by an
ignomini|ous death, and anticipate his fate by poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Glo&s;s him&s;elf had the addre&s;s to turn this cir|cum&s;tance
to his own account, intimating that they had, among them, made away with his
father, for fear circum&s;tances not altogether &s;o plea&s;ant &s;hould come
out on the trial. As to his own fate, it was this. He was put in the pillory,
where he har|rangued the populace to &s;uch good effect, that he per&s;uaded
them the con&s;titution of their country was rotten; that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
abu&s;es were practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who were entru&s;ted with the public
con|cerns; and, &s;o completely did he, for the moment, work upon the people's
credulity, that, when he returned to pri&s;on, the hor&s;es were taken from the
hackney coach, in which he rode, and the deluded populace, with one con&s;ent,
yoked them&s;elves in their place: exactly the &s;ame as if they were
ho|nourably conducting &s;ome patriot, who had done an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice
to his country!</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="331"> In proce&s;s of time he was liberated,
&s;ince when he has lived in various circum&s;tances, by depreda|tions on the
public; and, at this hour, goes about, like the arch fiend, his principal,
&s;eeking whom he may devour.</P>
<P>Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y, who had robbed Standfa&s;t, &s;carcely
arrived on the continent when &s;he was robbed and de&s;erted by Dogbolt. After
this, &s;he herded with a &s;et of contrabanders; and at length,&mdash;fir&s;t
being detected and branded&mdash;&s;he fini&s;hed her career di&s;ea&s;ed,
loath&s;ome, and a pauper, in the <HI>Hotel de Dieu.</HI></P>
<P>As to Tadpole and his wife, as they knew that a retro&s;pection
would bring out every particular of their nefarious conduct, they thought it
expedient to meet their examiners half way. Charles found the e&s;tate rather
improved than injured by Tadpole's management, and therefore &s;crupled not to
pay &s;uch bonds, and fulfil &s;uch other engagements, en|tered into by his
brother, as did not &s;trike at the <HI>terra firma</HI> of his ance&s;tors. He
al&s;o agreed to a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for the children; one of whom, at
this moment, is the be&s;t hor&s;e jockey, and the other the be&s;t maker of
nut-crackers, in the king|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="332"> Tadpole, with this money, and what he had
pri|vately ama&s;&s;ed, launched boldly into his own pro|fe&s;&s;ion of
attorney, to which he added that of money lender, and has accumulated an
immen&s;e fortune, by admini&s;tering to the nece&s;&s;ities of young men of
fa&s;hion, under age; not &s;crupling, occa&s;ionally, to lend the per&s;on of
his <HI>cara &s;po&s;a</HI>&mdash;on whom he doats to di&s;traction, and who
rules him with a rod of Iron&mdash;to bind an advantageous bargain.</P>
<P>The penitent John was put, by Kiddy, into the hands of a
methodi&s;t preacher, to complete his con|ver&s;ion; but, the good man going
the wrong way to work, by terrifying in&s;tead of &s;oothing him, his brain was
at length touched, and he fini&s;hed his life and his mi&s;ery together, by a
ra&s;h leap into Swa&s;h's mill-&s;tream.</P>
<P>As to the &s;inner Kiddy, as he u&s;ed to call him|&s;elf, he
lived for &s;ome time pretty comfortably on a hand&s;ome annuity that Charles
had granted him; but having frequented meetings, conferences, and
love-fea&s;ts, till his &s;en&s;es were a little deranged, he fir&s;t &s;langed
him&s;elf, as he called it, behind the door, and, being cut down, the &s;hock
&s;o preyed upon his &s;pirits, that, doubling his vi&s;its to the brandy
bottle, he is &s;aid literally to have gone out <PB N="333" REF="333"> of the
world with a dram in one hand and a homily in the other.</P>
<P>At length came the day which was to unite per|haps the mo&s;t
elegant and accompli&s;hed pair that ever graced the altar of Hymen. The grand
fea&s;t was conducted with prodigious &s;plendour, which the reader will the
more readily conceive, when he adds to the former de&s;cription of this
fe&s;tival the ad|ditional exertions upon the pre&s;ent happy occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every friend within the knowledge of any of the parties was
invited, and, among the re&s;t, Ego, Toogood, and Mu&s;quito, who, &s;pight of
their jar|ring di&s;po&s;itions, united in an univer&s;al acknow|ledgment that
wealth, worth, and happine&s;s were never more emulou&s;ly blended
together.</P>
<P>A few words more will &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary. The good
Mildman, in a very advanced age, yielded his breath amid&s;t the lamentations
of his pari&s;hio|ners, who &s;incerely mourned his memory, as they accompanied
his remains to their la&s;t home, and who&mdash;all they had&mdash;as their
only remaining tribute to his worth, dropt the tear of &s;en&s;ibility on the
grave of virtue.</P>
<P>Figgins, who married the amiable Jude, &s;uc|ceeded 
<PB N="334" REF="334"> Mildman. His reformation is perfect and confirmed, and
his conduct honourable and exem|plary. Ble&s;t with two &s;uch friends as Sir
Sidney and Charles, his happine&s;s is complete. His ef|forts at Ca&s;tlewick,
in conjunction with tho&s;e of Mr. Friend, at Little Hockley, who is &s;till
alive, though very old, have rendered tho&s;e indu&s;trious communities the
emulation of each other.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlow &s;ucceeded Emma as companion to Lady Roebuck, Emma
her&s;elf having, at the earne&s;t recommendation of the baronet, married the
butler, now Sir Sidney's land &s;teward. She had long be|fore, as I hinted to
the reader, a &s;neaking kindne&s;s for him, on account of his fidelity to his
ma&s;ter in France. This had improved, to u&s;e her own words, into e&s;teem,
from her knowledge of him in the fa|mily, and had been confirmed into love, by
his re|fu&s;ing to take a part again&s;t Sir Sidney in her grand plot, which,
however worthy in her, would, in him, have been treachery. She has &s;everal
children, who, in&s;tructed by her, are become excellent Engli&s;h &s;cholars,
for &s;he does not chu&s;e they &s;hould a&s;pire to any thing more. She is
univer&s;ally beloved, and will be univer&s;ally regretted. On a conver&s;ation
with Annette, the other day, in which this topic was touched upon, &s;he
&s;aid, that as her book of life now verged towards the la&s;t page, it gave
her great <PB N="335" REF="335"> &s;atisfaction to reflect that &s;he &s;hould
not fear to look at the word Finis, having inculcated, in every line, that
goodne&s;s is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for happine&s;s.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'The hour of death,' added Emma, for &s;he is
now grown rather &s;ententious, 'is the hell of the wick|ed, the purgatory of
the doubtful, and the heaven of the virtuous.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Balance is &s;till alive, and as much re&s;pected as ever.
Sir Sidney, who is Mr. Balance's &s;enior by a year, being now &s;eventy-five,
is al&s;o living in all the vigour of health and &s;trength. He can &s;till
play at cricket and quoits, and pitch the bar as well as ever; and it was but
the other day he was re|que&s;ted to let his name &s;tand in a tontine,
in&s;tead of that of a fa&s;hionable young man of twenty. The ve|nerable and
amiable Lady Roebuck is al&s;o living.&mdash;Her employment is the care of our
hero's children: out of &s;even, three of whom are alive: two boys and a girl.
The baronet has long &s;ince given over his idea of augmenting his grandeur as
to him&s;elf, but having recently 
<Q REND="inline">'done the &s;tate &s;ome &s;ervice,'</Q> he is
promi&s;ed a peerage in favour of Charles's &s;econd &s;on, by the name and
title of Sidney Roebuck, Earl of Ca&s;tlewick.</P>
<P>As to Charles and Annette, little more need be &s;aid. Complete
in beauty, goodne&s;s, clegance, and <PB N="336" REF="336"> virtue, no wonder
they are completely happy. Nor is the goodne&s;s and virtue of this amiable
commu|nity of friends &s;elfi&s;hly con&s;ined. It transfu&s;es its con&s;cious
ble&s;&s;ings to all around. Charles's dar|ling pa&s;&s;ion for patronizing
worth and merit, aided by Sir Sidney, flows now in its right channel. All are
&s;ure of encouragement who worthily apply for it, nor is there an individual
in either Ca&s;tlewick or Little Hockley that does not feel, and enjoy the
