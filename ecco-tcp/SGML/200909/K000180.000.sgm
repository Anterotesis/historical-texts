<P>THE FASHIONABLE LOVER; A COMEDY: As it is acted at the

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I COMMIT this Comedy to the pre&s;s with all po&s;&s;ible
gratitude to the Public for the reception it has met: I cannot flatter my&s;elf
that the &s;ame applau&s;e will follow it to the clo&s;et; for as it owed much
to an excellent repre&s;entation, I have neither on this, nor any preceding
occa&s;ion, con&s;idered my&s;elf other|wi&s;e than as a &s;harer only with the
Managers and Performers, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in the
exhibition of my trifling pro|ductions. But it is not on the &s;core of
&s;pectacle only that I am obliged to Mr. Garrick; I am both in the in&s;tance
of this Comedy, and in that of the We&s;t Indian, materially indebted to his
judgment, and owe the good effect of many incidents in both to his
&s;ugge&s;tion and advice: the correction of a real critic is as different from
that of a pre|tender, as the operation of a &s;urgeon from the &s;tab of an
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">The Comedy, now &s;ubmitted to the reader, is
de&s;ign'd as an attempt upon his heart, and as &s;uch proceeds with little
deviation from mine; if it &s;hould be thought therefore, that I have meant
well, the charge of having ex|ecuted indifferently I &s;hall patiently &s;ubmit
to: I have on this occa&s;ion, (as on the two preceding ones) wholly re&s;ted
my perform|ance upon &s;uch poor abilities, as I am ma&s;ter of; I am not
con&s;cious of having drawn any particular a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either in
re&s;pect of cha|racter or de&s;ign, from the productions of others; altho' I
am far from pre&s;uming to &s;ay or think, that I have ever exhibited any
cha|racter purely original: The level manners of a poli&s;h'd country, like
this, do not &s;upply much matter for the comic mu&s;e, which de|lights in
variety and extravagance; where|ever therefore I have made any attempts at
novelty, I have found my&s;elf obliged either to dive into the lower cla&s;s of
men, or be|take my&s;elf to the out-&s;kirts of the empire; the center is too
equal and refined for &s;uch purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Whether the reception of this Comedy may be &s;uch, as &s;hall
encourage me to future efforts, is of &s;mall con&s;equence to the public; 
<PB N="vii" REF="6"> but if it &s;hould chance to obtain &s;ome little credit
with the candid part of mankind, and it's author for once e&s;cape without
tho&s;e per|&s;onal and unworthy a&s;per&s;ions, which writers, who hide their
own names, fling on them who publi&s;h their's, my &s;ucce&s;s it may be hoped
will draw forth others to the undertaking with far &s;uperior requi&s;ites; and
that there are numbers under this de&s;cription, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility keeps
'em &s;ilent, I am well per|&s;waded when I con&s;ider how general it is for
men of the fine&s;t parts, to be &s;ubject to the fine&s;t feelings; and I
would &s;ubmit whe|ther this unhand&s;ome practice of abu&s;e, is not
calculated to create in the minds of men of genius, not only a di&s;inclination
to en|gage in dramatic compo&s;itions, but a languid and unanimated manner of
executing them: It will drive men from a nece&s;&s;ary confidence in their own
powers, and it will be thought convenient to get out of the torrent's way, by
mooring under the lee of &s;ome great name, either French or Italian, and
&s;itting down contented with the humble, but le&s;s expo|&s;ed, ta&s;k of
tran&s;lation. Should this take place, a cold elaborate &s;tile will prevail in
our drama, clearly oppo&s;ite to the national <PB N="viii" REF="7"> character,
and not at all at uni&s;on with the ta&s;te of our writers them&s;elves.
Correctne&s;s will become the chief object in view, by which, though much may
be avoided, little will be obtained: nothing great can be ac|compli&s;hed on a
plain; turn to Shake&s;pear, and you find the Alps not more irregular than his
genius; had the critics of his days marked his inaccuracies with that illiberal
&s;pirit which &s;eems re&s;erved for our time, the bold and daring &s;allies
of the &s;ublime&s;t Mu&s;e would probably have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and
neither the great Actor who has brought his &s;cenes to life, nor the elegant
E&s;&s;ayi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on the Genius and
Writings of Shake&s;pear.</BIBL></NOTE> who has defended them, would have made
&s;uch di&s;play of their own genius in the celebration and protec|tion of
his.</P>

<L>Up to the poet yonder with this proof:</L>
<L>I'd read it to you, but, in faith, 'tis odds</L>

<L>A ready imp I am, who kindly greets</L>

<L>If any author of prolific brains,</L>

<L>If any gentle poet, big with rhime,</L>
<L>Has run his reck'ning out and gone his time;</L>
<L>If any critic, pregnant with ill-nature,</L>
<L>Cries out to be deliver'd of his &s;atire;</L>

<L>He may lye in, in private, if he chu&s;es;</L>
<L>We've &s;ingle lodgings there for &s;ecret &s;inners,</L>
<L>With good encouragement for young beginners.</L>

<L>Here's one now that is free enough in rea&s;on;</L>
<L>This bard breeds regularly once a &s;ea&s;on;</L>
<L>Three of a &s;ort, of homely form and feature,</L>
<L>The plain coar&s;e progeny of humble nature;</L>
<L>Home-bred and born; no &s;trangers he di&s;plays,</L>

<L>Nine tedious months he bore this babe about,</L>
<L>Let it in charity live nine nights out;</L>
<L>Stay but his month up; give &s;ome little law;</L>

<P>HOOT! fellows, haud your honds: pack up your damn'd clarinets,
and gang your gait, for a pair of lubberly min&s;trels, as you are. An you
cou'd hondle the bagpipe in&s;tead, I wou'd na' &s;ay you nay: ah! 'tis an

<P>Fedon, Mon&s;ieur Colin, for why you have &s;end away the horns?
It is very much the ton in this country for the fine gentlemens to have the

company; tous les maccaroni below &s;tairs, et toute la coterie above. Hark,

<P>My morning budget, Sir; a breakfa&s;t of good deeds; the

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jar.</SPEAKER>
<P>With difficulty; for he obtruded not his &s;orrows on the world,

take 'em all, &s;ike a family of free-booters, Mai&s;ter Mortimer; an I &s;peak
a word to 'em, or preach up a little needful oeconomy, hoot! the whole clan is
up in arms. I may &s;peak it in your ear, an' the de'el him&s;ell was to turn
hou&s;e-keeper, he cou'd na' pitch upon a fitter &s;et; fellows of all trades,

<P>Yes, and de&s;troy'd; his head, heart, happine&s;s,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whence learn you that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>From little Napthali of St. Mary Axe: when a man borrows money
of a Jew, 'tis a pre&s;umption no Chri&s;|tian can be found to lend him
any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is your Lord driven to &s;uch wretched &s;hifts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoot! know you not that every lo&s;ing game&s;ter has his Jew?
He is your only doctor in a de&s;perate ca&s;e; when the regulars have brought
you to Death's door, the quack is invited to u&s;her you in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Jew, Colin, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;avours more of the
lawyer than the doctor; for I take if he makes you &s;ign and &s;eal as long as
you have effects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You've hit the nail o' the hede; my Laird will &s;ign to any
thing; there's bonds, and blanks, and bar|gains, and promi&s;ary notes, and a
damn'd &s;ight of rogue|ries, depend on't. Ecod he had a bundle for his

<P>That, Colin, may be pa&s;t my power to hinder; yet even that
&s;hall be attempted: find out the Jew that Bridgemore has employ'd, and bring
him hither, if you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="30">

<P>Let me alone for that; there never was a Jew &s;ince Sam&s;on's

<P> Sir, Since neither Lord Abberville's te&s;timony, nor my

prevent Mi&s;s Bridgemore's threaten'd di&s;mi&s;&s;ion by withdrawing my&s;elf
for ever from your family: how the world will receive a de&s;titute
defencele&s;s orphan I am now to prove; I enter on my trial without any armour
but my innocence; which, though in&s;ufficient to &s;ecure to me the
continuance of your confidence, will, by the favour of Providence, &s;erve, I
hope, to &s;upport me under the lo&s;s of it.</P>

<P>No, there may be a legal pro&s;titute as well as a licentious

<P>Faith, Sir, indifferent well; he has brought a con|&s;iderable

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he has di&s;cover'd that the bricks are not

&s;alt not good for pre&s;erving: in &s;hort, Doctor, he has no ta&s;te for

yours is the road to happine&s;s; I have been lo&s;t in error, but I &s;hall
trace your &s;teps and pre&s;s to overtake you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's well &s;aid; there &s;poke your father from within
you: now begone; fly to the altars of your country lares; vi&s;it that nur&s;e
of contemplation, &s;olitude; and while you range your groves, that &s;hook at
every rattle of the dice, a&s;k of your rea&s;on, why you was a game&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've been a madman; I have lo&s;t an humble faithful friend,
who&s;e &s;ervices wou'd be invaluable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ay, your Highlander, your poor Macleod; our plan mu&s;t
&s;top without his help; I'm but a projector, he mu&s;t execute&mdash;but there
likewi&s;e I can &s;erve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Mortimer, how much have I mi&s;taken thee!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, I have my faults; I'm an un|toward fellow, and
&s;tand as much in need of a reform as any of you all.</P>

<STAGE>DOCTOR DRUID enters ha&s;tily, followed by COLIN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tutor me truly&mdash;talk to me! Pray, Gen|tlemens, bear
witne&s;s: is Ma&s;ter Colins here a proper teacher of the dialects, d'ye
&s;ee, and pronunciations of the Engli&s;h tongue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="75">
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Is there not Duncan Ro&s;s of Aberdeen that lactures
twice a week in oratory at the Seven Dials? and does not Sawney Fergu&s;on, a
cou&s;in of mine awn, admini&s;ter the Engli&s;h language in it's utmo&s;t
elegance at Am&s;terdam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bear witne&s;s, that is all I &s;ay, bear wit|ne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do; there is not one among&s;t us, Doctor, but can witne&s;s
to &s;ome noble act of Colin's; and we wou'd not wound his harmle&s;s vanity,
for any bribe that you can offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colin, I've done you wrong; but I was not my&s;elf; be you no
wor&s;e a &s;ervant than you have been, and you &s;hall find henceforward I
will be a better ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm &s;atisfied; an you'll neglect your&s;all na more than I
&s;hall do, things will gang well enow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t apologize to Colin too; like my Lord Ab|berville, I was
not my&s;elf when I rebuff'd you on the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi&s;s Aubrey's
letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, Mai&s;ter Tyrrel; 'tis not for a mon to re&s;ent
the pertne&s;s of a child, or the petulance of a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aug.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what &s;hall I &s;ay to him? where &s;hall I find words to
thank him as I ought?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I father all your obligations; 'twas not you but me his bounty
&s;av'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Abb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir, in point of obligation I &s;tand fir&s;t. By how much
there is more di&s;grace in doing than in &s;uffering a violence, by &s;o much
I am more his debtor than you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod and that is true enow; Heaven &s;ends mi&s;|fortune, but
the De'il &s;ends mi&s;chief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Druid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Ma&s;ter Colins, all is pa&s;t and over; you have got your
place again, and all is well. Coot now, let me admoni&s;h you for the future to
be quiet and hear rea&s;on; moderate your choler and your pa&s;&s;ions and your
partialities: it is not for a clown like you to prattle and di&s;pute with me;
in fait you &s;hou'd know better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, 'tis you that &s;hou'd know better; in this poor
Higlander the force of prejudice has &s;ome plea, becau&s;e he is a clown; but
you, a citizen that &s;hou'd be of the world, who&s;e heart philo&s;ophy and
travel might <PB N="63" REF="76"> have open'd, &s;hou'd know better than to
join the cry with tho&s;e, who&s;e charity, like the limitation of a brief,
&s;tops &s;hort at Berwick, and never circulates beyond the Tweed. By Heaven,
I'd rather weed out one &s;uch unmanly pre|judice from the hearts of my
countrymen, than add another Indies to their empire.</P>
