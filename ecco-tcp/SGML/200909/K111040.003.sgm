<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LEST the World &s;hould imagine I publi&s;h'd this Volume, in
or|der to di&s;plea&s;e my Father, or any other Per&s;on, the 
<PB N="viii" REF="8"> Reflection of which, would give me the utmo&s;t
Unea&s;ine&s;s, I thought it quite nece&s;&s;ary, in this Place, to declare the
Rea|&s;on it lay &s;o long in Ob&s;cu|rity; and why it is at this Time made
publick.</P>
<P>My Mother, before her Death, had taken in a Number of
Sub|&s;criptions in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and after her Departure from Life, as I
was left quite de&s;titute of Money or Friends, I was obliged to pur&s;ue the
De&s;ign of Printing the Vo|lume; to which I was encourag|ed, by &s;everal
Per&s;ons of real Worth and Di&s;tinction: but tho' I became indebted to the
Pub|lick, it was never in my power, <PB N="ix" REF="9"> to rai&s;e a
&s;ufficient Sum to de|fray the Expence of Printing; but on the contrary, thro'
the Re&s;entment of tho&s;e, whom my Mother had formerly de&s;crib'd, I was not
only ba&s;ely traduc'd in my Reputation, but plung'd into a World of
Calamities, which I may, perhaps, at &s;ome Time hereafter relate, together
with the various Pa&s;|&s;ages of my Life. However, among&s;t many
Accu&s;ations, that fell heavy on me, one was, that I had defrauded the
Publick, by taking Sub|&s;criptions to a Work, which I not only had not a
De&s;ign of Printing, but one that never exi&s;ted, except in my Imagi|nation;
as they were kind <PB N="x" REF="10"> enough to declare, that my Mother never
wrote &s;uch a Book.</P>
<P>Yet &s;hould I have been con|tent, to have &s;tood all this
Re|proach, and much more, nay, as the Sub&s;cribers were Per&s;ons of Fortune
and Humanity, who&s;e Contributions proceeded more from a De&s;ire of &s;erving
me, than a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Book, I would have re|main'd their Debtor
for ever, &s;ooner than have brought &s;uch an Affair over; but, that having a
Wife and Family to &s;upport, and finding it impo&s;|&s;ible to obtain from my
Fa|ther the &s;malle&s;t Succour, <PB N="xi" REF="11"> though I applied to him
in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and pathetick Manner: On the contrary, when I
found him endeavour|ing to hurt me in the Opini|on of 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly the Lord Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Derry,</HI> to whom I am much obliged.</NOTE>tho&s;e, with whom I had
&s;ome Intere&s;t; I thought it but prudent, to acquit my|&s;elf of the Charge
of Di&s;hone&s;|ty, by delivering the Books to my Benefactors, and at the
&s;ame Time, to endeavour to make as much as po&s;&s;ible by it. To this end I
came to <HI>London</HI> la&s;t <HI>October,</HI> but had not brought the
Manu&s;cript with me, which was in the <PB N="xii" REF="12"> Hands of Mr.
<HI>Powel,</HI> Printer in <HI>Dublin.</HI> I thought it prudent, not being
over-&s;tocked with Ca&s;h, to try how a Sub&s;crip|tion would take in
<HI>London.</HI> before I ventured to pay a Sum, which was due to
<HI>Powel.</HI> I therefore printed Propo&s;als, and communicated my Plan to
Mr. <HI>Foote,</HI> who had, when in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> profe&s;s'd a great
Friend|&s;hip for me, (not without &s;ome Cau&s;e) as will be &s;een
hereaf|ter. He highly approv'd my Project, and a&s;&s;ured me I might make a
con&s;iderable Sum by it; and that for his own Part, he would get me at lea&s;t
a hundred Sub&s;cribers, all which, not knowing the Gen|tleman's 
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"> real Di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;incerely believed. His Farce
of the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> was at this Time acting; and I
ventured to write the following Lines upon it, which I &s;ent to him in a
Letter, and beg'd his Permi&s;&s;ion, to in&s;ert them in the Daily
Adverti&s;er.

<PB REF="24">
<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. Letitia Pilkington.</HEAD>
<P>A Third Volume of Memoirs is really a bold Undertaking, as they
are generally light, frothy, and vain; yet I have met with &s;uch un|hop'd
Succe&s;s, that I am quite encouraged to proceed; more e&s;pecially as my Word
is pa&s;s'd to the Publick; and my Word I have ever held &s;acred. I cannot,
like a certain Female Writer, &s;ay, I hope if I have done nothing to plea&s;e,
I have done nothing to offend; for truly I mean to give both Plea&s;ure and
Offence: Lemon and Sugar is very pretty. I &s;hould be &s;orry to write a
Satire which did not <PB N="2" REF="25"> &s;ting, nor will I ever write a
Panegyrick on an Unde&s;erver: If a Rogue &s;hould happen to be mine hone&s;t
Friend, I owe him Silence; but that is the mo&s;t he can expect.</P>
<P>Many indeed are glad to become Pur|cha&s;ers of it. Per&s;ons whom
I know nothing of, come and beg I may not put them into the Third Volume; and
they will &s;ub&s;cribe: Surely then they &s;hould knock at their own Hearts;
and if it confe&s;s a natural Guiltine&s;s, 
<Q> 
<L>Let it not breathe a Thought upon their Tongue</L> 
<L>To my Di&s;honour&mdash;</L> 
<BIBL>Shake&s;pear.</BIBL></Q> I threaten not any, nor did I ever
do it; but Characters are my Game, who 
<Q> 
<L>Eye Nature's Walks, &s;hoot Folly as it flies,</L> 
<L>And catch the Manners living as they ri&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould now be glad to know how I could pro&s;ecute my own
Hi&s;tory without intermingling that of others; I have not lived in De&s;arts,
where no Men abide, nor in a Cave, like <HI>Eccho</HI>; therefore it 
<PB N="3" REF="26"> is no more in my power to grant &s;uch unrea&s;onable
Reque&s;ts, when a Book is requir'd of me, than it is in that of an
hi&s;torical Painter to give a good Piece, when he is po&s;itively commanded
never to draw the Likene&s;s of any thing in Heaven or on Earth.</P>
<P>But, Oh my dear LADIES, why are you &s;o frightened? Why &s;o many
Supplica|tions to a Per&s;on unacquainted with you? Have you all then a &s;ore
Place, which you are afraid I &s;hould touch? But now<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taken from the Play of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and <HI>Thisbe,</HI> in
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Mid&s;ummer Nights Dream.</HI></NOTE>, I &s;ay this
to you, or to the &s;ame Defect: Ladies, or mo&s;t fair Ladies, I would
re|que&s;t you not to fear, not to tremble; my Life for yours, if you think I
come as a Lion, 'twere Pity of my Life: No, no, I am no &s;uch thing; I am a
Woman, as other Women are&mdash;</P>
<P>But, after all, it does not a little &s;ur|pri&s;e me, that every
Per&s;on who &s;uffers a Panick, le&s;t their own Reputations &s;hould be
attack'd, has not a little Com|pa&s;&s;ion for that of another: No, no! let 
<PB N="4" REF="27"> them find a Flaw in a Brilliant, and by the Help of their
magnifying Talents, they &s;hall dim it all over: If they look upon this as a
Virtue, 'tis one I &s;hall never be emulous of.</P>
<P>I remember Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> told me, he once dined at a
Per&s;on's Hou&s;e, where the Part of the Table-Cloth, which was next to him,
happened to have a &s;mall Hole in it, which, &s;ays he, I tore as wide as I
could; then a&s;ked for &s;ome Soop, and fed my&s;elf through the Hole. The
Dean, who was a great Friend to Hou&s;|wifery, did this to mortify the Lady of
the Hou&s;e; but, upon my Word, by the general Love of Scandal and De|traction
in <HI>Dublin,</HI> one might rea&s;onably imagine they were all to feed
them&s;elves through the Holes, which they had made in the Characters of
others: 
<Q>But 'tis of no Con&s;equence to me; as Trea&s;on and Malice now
have done their wor&s;t. 
<BIBL>Shake&s;pear.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Reputation once gone is never to be retriev'd: The Wi&s;e &s;ay,
it is as often <PB N="5" REF="28"> gain'd without Merit, as lo&s;t without a
Crime; &s;o I mu&s;t comfort my&s;elf the be&s;t I can. The Fable of
<HI>Reputation, Fire,</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> is too well known to want a
Recital; and, to quote a Paragraph from a late Letter of Mr. CIBBER'S to me, in
An&s;wer to one of mine, wherein I had acquainted him, that a Gentleman who had
formerly been prejudiced again&s;t him, was now his very &s;incere Admirer; as
his Lines may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure be applicable to me, I &s;hall in&s;ert them
as follows: 
<Q>It is now growing too late in Life, to be much concerned about
whatever Good or Evil the World may think it worth their while to &s;ay of me.
All I have to do, is to fix a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own Integrity, and then
let the Devil do his wor&s;t. Truth has a &s;trong Arm, and in that the
weake&s;t Per&s;on living, with an hone&s;t Heart, may tru&s;t for their
Protection.</Q></P>
<P>So let this &s;erve by way of <HI>Preface,</HI> while I proceed in
my <HI>Narrative,</HI> or, 
<Q><PB N="6" REF="29"> 
<L>Take the &s;prightly Reed, and &s;ing and play,</L> 
<L>Carele&s;s of what the cen&s;uring World may
&s;ay.</L></Q></P>
<P>And here, before I proceed, to give Ea&s;e to every Heart, which
may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer any Anxiety, on Account of what might be &s;aid of
them, I proclaim Peace to all, but tho&s;e who have directly af|fronted me.
'Tis but a mean Piece of Cowardice to in&s;ult a Woman, and as &s;ome Gentlemen
have had the Courage to challenge me, by the known Laws of Chivalry, I have a
right to chu&s;e the Weapons; a <HI>Pen</HI> is mine, let them take up another,
and may-hap they will meet their Match.</P>
<P>But <HI>Hibernian</HI> Writers are evermore threatened, not with
the Wit of their Antagoni&s;ts, but the Arm of the Fle&s;h; and truly that is
&s;uch a knock-down Ar|gument, as I, at lea&s;t, am utterly unable to
re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, were any Folly of mine to produce real Wit in
another Per|&s;on, <PB N="7" REF="30"> I &s;hould not be di&s;plea&s;ed to be
roundly rallied.</P>
<P>I was very well diverted with Mr. <HI>Woodward</HI>'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this Gentleman exhibited at <HI>Dublin,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition
to Mr. <HI>Foote</HI>'s Tea.</NOTE> Coffee, and humorous De&s;cription of me,
crying, 
<Q> 
<L>Sub&s;cribe, or el&s;e I'll paint you like the Devil.</L></Q>
Though how I, who never either was a dramatick Writer, or a Player, came to
have &s;uch extraordinary Marks of Di&s;|tinction paid me from the Theatre, is
more than I can readily account for.</P>
<P>However I enjoy'd the Je&s;t, and the wor&s;t Mark of Re&s;entment
I &s;hew'd, was to &s;end him a Crown for a Box Ticket, which he graciou&s;ly
accepted; and in Re|turn, got his Friend in the College to add &s;ix Couplets
of Scurrility to his for|mer Encomium on me.</P>
<P>No marvel, for I remember the Dean told me, he paid a Man's Debt
on Ac|count of his having wrote &s;omething tollerably good; and the next Proof
he gave of his Talents, as &s;oon as he was <PB N="8" REF="31"> releas'd from
Jail, was to write a Satire on his Benefactor and Deliverer. I told this
Pa&s;&s;age to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured me he had been ju&s;t
&s;erv'd in the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>Gratitude is, of all Virtues, the mo&s;t &s;eldom practis'd; the
Cau&s;e of this De|fect, I take to be our innate Pride; few Per&s;ons can bear
to be under the Weight of an Obligation, not con&s;idering that, 
<Q>

<P>ONE Day as I was &s;itting in my Shop,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the 2d Vol. of the&s;e Memoirs.</NOTE> a Woman who though
very badly dre&s;t, had a Dignity in her Air which di&s;tingui&s;h'd her from
the Vul|gar, &s;tood reading the Paper I had &s;tuck up, with Regard to writing
Let|ters and Petitions. At length &s;he came in, and begg'd of me to write a
Petition for her, to his Maje&s;ty, from whom, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;he hop'd for
a Pen&s;ion. I <PB N="15" REF="38"> a&s;ked her what Title &s;he had to it? She
&s;aid, if I could have Patience to hear her Story, &s;he was certain I would
think &s;he had a very ju&s;t one. As I was fond of Novelties, I a&s;&s;ured
her &s;he could not oblige me more; &s;o to avoid Interrup|tion, I took her
into the Parlour, when &s;he began her Hi&s;tory as follows: 
<Q> 
<P> I am, &s;aid &s;he, Grandaughter to the Marquis of
<HI>Vendo&s;me</HI>; my Mother, who&s;e Name was <HI>Margaretta de
Tia|ange,</HI> was one of the mo&s;t celebrated Beauties in the Court of
<HI>France.</HI> The late Electre&s;s of <HI>Hanover</HI> (poor Lady, though
her Hu&s;band was crown'd King of <HI>England,</HI> &s;he never was
ac|knowledg'd as Queen) had &s;o fond an Affection for her, that &s;he could
not think of parting with her; but when &s;he was married, entreated &s;he
would accompany her to <HI>Hanover</HI>; their uni|ted Prayers prevailed on my
Grand|father to give his A&s;&s;ent, and the Electre&s;s plac'd her in Quality
of the fir&s;t Lady of her Bedchamber, that <PB N="16" REF="39"> &s;he might
ever have her near her Per|&s;on,&mdash;</P> 
<P> Whatever Regret my Mother felt, at the &s;trange Difference
&s;he found be|tween the Court of <HI>Paris</HI> and the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Herenhau&s;en,</HI> yet being happy in the Favour of her Royal
Mi&s;tre&s;s, young and chearful, &s;he made her&s;elf quite ea&s;y; and &s;he
and Count <HI>Con|ning&s;mark</HI> u&s;ed to &s;et their Heads to|gether, to
&s;tudy what might be mo&s;t amu&s;ing to the lovely Lady.</P> 
<P> But alas! while they thought only of Innocence, the Prince&s;s
<HI>Sophia,</HI> and the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> a di&s;carded
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>Elector</HI>'s, had other Schemes in their Heads, which
not long after they put in Practice, to the De&s;truction of the
<HI>Count,</HI> the Di&s;grace of the <HI>Electre&s;s,</HI> and the
Bani&s;hment of every Per&s;on, whom &s;he honoured with her Confidence.</P> 
<P> I have frequently heard my Mo|ther declare, that &s;he believ'd
there was not in the World a more virtuous Per&s;on than the Electre&s;s, and
in|deed <PB N="17" REF="40"> her Conduct from the Time of her Separation from
the late King, to the Hour of her Death, &s;ufficiently convinced the World of
her un&s;potted Purity.</P> 
<P> Well, in the general Ruin my Mother, as her fir&s;t Favourite,
was in|evitably involv'd: She was order'd to return home to <HI>France</HI>;
and as &s;he was a Woman of Quality, a Man of War was fitted out for that
Purpo&s;e.</P> </Q></P>
<P>I could not here avoid interrupting her, to &s;ay I wonder'd that
the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;hould enter into any Scheme which might in
the lea&s;t reflect on the Honour of her own illu&s;trious Family; &s;he
an&s;wer'd, the Prince&s;s lov'd nothing &s;o well as Dominion, and as the
Ladies of <HI>France</HI> had a natural Turn to Politicks, &s;he was afraid the
Electre&s;s might inter|fere, &s;o as to injure her Power, which was almo&s;t
ab&s;olute. Oh! Ambition! by what cruel Means do&s;t thou compa&s;s thy Ends? I
de&s;ired her to proceed, which &s;he did as follows. 
<Q><PB N="18" REF="41"> 
<P> My Mother return'd home &s;afe, though much dejected at a
Separa|tion from her Mi&s;tre&s;s, with whom had &s;he been permitted, &s;he
would willingly have embraced an Exile from the gay World. But as Time
in&s;en|&s;ibly wears off Affliction, and le&s;&s;ens the Object, by removing
it to a greater Di&s;tance, &s;o &s;he began to re&s;ume her native
Chearfulne&s;s, and once more &s;hone at Court.</P> 
<P> The fir&s;t Night &s;he appeared there, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nobleman, for as &s;uch he pa&s;s'd him&s;elf, (neither did his good Mien or
Politene&s;s, in the lea&s;t con|tradict this generally received Opini|on) paid
his Addre&s;&s;es to her. Gal|lantry and Complai&s;ance are &s;o much the Mode
at <HI>Paris,</HI> that my Mother took all he &s;aid of <HI>his</HI>
Pa&s;&s;ion, and <HI>her</HI> Charms, meerly as Words of Cour&s;e, and told him
&s;o; he an&s;wered that he found &s;he was unacquainted with the Temper of the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who, above all other People, particularly valued
them&s;elves on Sincerity, and &s;corned <PB N="19" REF="42"> Deceit or
Hypocri&s;y even to the Fair, to whom mo&s;t Men practi&s;e it. She an&s;wer'd,
the Ladies in his Country mu&s;t certainly be very happy; he &s;aid, the mo&s;t
convincing Proof he could give of the Reality of his Pa&s;&s;ion, was, that,
provided her Heart and Hand were di&s;engaged, he would u&s;e his utmo&s;t
Endeavours to merit both. She a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was intirely at her
Father's Di&s;po&s;al, and that if he was &s;erious in his Declaration, he
mu&s;t ap|ply to the Marquis of <HI>Vendo&s;me.</HI> Ac|cordingly, next Day he
paid the Mar|quis a Vi&s;it, and brought &s;uch Cre|dentials, of his being a
Man of For|tune and Quality in <HI>England,</HI> that the Marquis had but one
Objection, which was an Unwillingne&s;s to part with my Mother; however, my
Father pro|mi&s;ed they would once a Year pay the Marquis a Vi&s;it: So all
Things being agreed on, the Marriage was celebra|brated with great Pomp and
Fe&s;|tivity.</P> 
<P><PB N="20" REF="43"> No &s;ooner were the Rejoicings end|ed,
than it was whi&s;per'd my Father was not a Man of Quality, but an Impo&s;tor.
This greatly afflicted both the Marquis and my Mother; they mentioned it to my
Father, who a&s;|&s;ured them it was a malicious Fal|&s;hood, rais'd by &s;ome
Per&s;ons who en|vy'd his Happine&s;s. As it was too late to retract what was
done, they could only hope the be&s;t. Shortly after, my Father urg'd a
Nece&s;&s;ity of his returning to <HI>London,</HI> to which the Marquis
reluctantly con&s;ented.</P> 
<P> At <HI>Dover</HI> my Father's Chariot met them, carried them
to a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e, where there were a Number of Servants in rich
Liveries, waiting the Commands of the Bride and Bride|groom.</P> 
<P> But after all, not to hold you longer in Su&s;pen&s;e, my
Father was a Limner; but &s;o excellent in his Art, that he could well afford
to keep his Wife like a Man of Quality. However, as there is no Country where
Per&s;ons &s;et <PB N="21" REF="44"> a higher Value on noble Blood than
<HI>France</HI>; my Mother was cruelly mor|tified to find her&s;elf impo&s;ed
upon, and fell into a deep Melancholy, which preying on the very Pith of Life,
&s;he langui&s;h'd in a Con&s;umption for three Years and died, leaving me and
another Daughter de&s;olate Orphans.</P> 
<P> After this Lo&s;s, which I was too young to regret, my Father
brought in a Woman, whom it &s;eems he had &s;ome Time kept as a Mi&s;tre&s;s,
to order his Hou&s;hold, and take care of us, which &s;he did &s;o well, that
at length my Father married her.</P> 
<P> Here happened a mo&s;t &s;trange Re|ver&s;e of Fortune to us:
For no &s;ooner did this Woman attain her Ends, than &s;he altered her Conduct,
and from a fawning Servant, turned a haughty and de&s;potick Tyrant. My Father
was oblig'd to turn off all his old Ser|vants, becau&s;e they did not pay
Re&s;|pect enough to her Lady&s;hip, for he had the Honour of Knighthood
con|ferred on him by King <HI>William.</HI></P> 
<P><PB N="22" REF="45"> This Step-Dame now continually
endeavour'd to &s;et my Father again&s;t us; till at length, wearied out with
In|juries, I hired my&s;elf as a Servant to the Governor's Lady of <HI>St.
Chri&s;tophers</HI>; and &s;he being informed who I was, treated me with the
utmo&s;t Kindne&s;s.</P> 
<P> This unhealthful Climate &s;oon de|prived me of her, who with
her dying Breath, recommended me to the Care of the Governor; he called me up,
told me her Reque&s;t, and kindly &s;aid, whoever was dear to her, it &s;hould
be his particular Care to protect, even for her Sake.</P> 
<P> I kneeled down by the Bed&s;ide, to ble&s;s them both for
their Goodne&s;s, my Mi&s;tre&s;s took my Hand, gra&s;p'd it very hard, and
in&s;tantly expir'd.</P> 
<P> I fainted away, and my Ma&s;ter, as I was afterwards
informed, quitted the Chamber, bidding the Servants take care of the poor
Child.</P> 
<P> When the Funeral was over, and that the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports
of my Ma&s;ter's Sorrow were abated, he de&s;ired to &s;ee <PB N="23" REF="46">
me, and renew'd his kind A&s;&s;urances of Protection and Favour to me. He made
me dine at his Table, &s;aying, that my innocent Prattle diverted his
Melancholly; and I, &s;tudious to plea&s;e him, did it &s;o effectually, that
in&s;tead of my being his Servant, he became mine; and as he was too humane and
generous, to entertain a di&s;honourable Thought, he propo&s;ed Matrimony to
me, an Offer too con&s;iderable for me to reject.</P> 
<P> The Evening before the Day ap|pointed for our Nuptials, my
dear Ma&s;ter, Friend, and Lover, was taken very ill, on which they were
deferred. But his Illne&s;s increa&s;ing, he thought proper to have the
Marriage Ceremo|ny performed, made his Will, and as he had no Children, left me
all his Fortune, and died the next Day.</P> 
<P> Though I cannot &s;ay I was in Love with this Gentleman, yet
Gratitude made me a &s;incerely &s;orrowful Widow; though I was young, rich,
and, as the World &s;aid, hand&s;ome.</P> 
<P><PB N="24" REF="47"> When my Year of Mourning ex|pired, I had
&s;everal Matches propo&s;ed to me, of which I made Choice of the wor&s;t. He
was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> but to &s;ay the Truth had nothing but his
Per&s;on to recommend him. He was addicted to every Vice, and con&s;e|quently
&s;oon &s;quandered the plentiful Fortune I had brought him.</P> 
<P> And at la&s;t, one Day when I was abroad, he robbed the
Hou&s;e of every thing it contained that was valuable, and he, with a Negro
Woman Ser|vant I had, got on board a Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P> I was now plung'd into not only the Extremity of Sorrow, but
al&s;o of Want. However, being very expert at my Needle, particularly in
Em|broidery, and al&s;o very curious in Shell Work; I &s;et up a School, and
in|&s;tructed young Ladies. Money is very ea&s;y to be got there, and &s;o it
ought, for the I&s;land is productive of nothing for the Service of Life,
nei|ther <PB N="25" REF="48"> Fruit nor Herbage, and conse|quently there are no
Cattle, but what they have either from the Continent, or &s;alted from
<HI>England.</HI></P> 
<P> Well; bad as the Place was, I lived there thirty Years after
the Departure of my &s;econd Hu&s;band, tolerably ea&s;y; till at length I
received, from an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain of a Ship, a Letter from the
Si&s;ter I have mentioned, who was extremely well married in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and gave me a kind Invitation to come and pa&s;s the Remainder of my Life with
her.</P> 
<P> Accordingly I embraced the fir&s;t Opportunity of returning
to my dear native Country; all the Ladies entreat|ed me to &s;tay, but finding
me deter|mined to the contrary, they gave me &s;ignal Marks of their Favour:
Each making me a Pre&s;ent, and a&s;&s;uring me that if ever I returned, I
&s;hould be af|fectionately received.</P> 
<P> We had a tolerable Voyage, even till we were in Sight of the
Engli&s;h Shore; when a furious Tempe&s;t aro&s;e, <PB N="26" REF="49"> which
&s;et us almo&s;t be&s;ide our&s;elves. The Goods were thrown over Board, &s;o
that I lo&s;t all my Cloaths; and a few Minutes after, we &s;truck upon a Rock,
but by God's Providence, not a Soul peri&s;hed. All that I &s;aved was a
Ba&s;ket of Curio&s;ities, &s;uch as the I&s;land afforded.</P> 
<P> But not to detain you with trivial Circum&s;tances, I got to
<HI>London,</HI> and went to my Si&s;ter's Hou&s;e, which I found hung with
black, &s;he in her Coffin, and the Hear&s;e ready to con|vey her to the
Grave.</P> 
<P> This was a dreadful Di&s;appointment to me, for I was quite a
Stranger, moneyle&s;s, and could not rea&s;onably hope for much Favour from a
Bro|ther-in-law, whom I had never &s;een, e&s;pecially as the Link of the Chain
which united us, was now di&s;&s;olv'd.</P> 
<P> The next Day I went to him; and, upon telling him the
Circum&s;tances of my Life, exactly as my Si&s;ter had done, he had the
Goodne&s;s to give me <PB N="27" REF="50"> her Cloathes; a &s;ea&s;onable
Relief, as my own were lo&s;t.</P> 
<P> The following Day I went into a Broker's Shop, to know if the
Per&s;on who kept it would buy &s;ome of my Merchandize: He de&s;ired me to
come in, and &s;eemed &s;urpris'd at the Variety and Beauty of my Collection;
and perceiving me very faint, for indeed I was all almo&s;t fami&s;h'd, he
offered me a Dram; which I refus'd, as I was &s;en&s;ible it mu&s;t have got
the better of one &s;o weak as I was.</P> 
<P> However, I accepted of &s;ome Toa&s;t and Ale, which, I
really think, &s;aved my Life: After this Act of Civility I told my
Di&s;tre&s;s to him, and he kindly gave me a Lodging, and re|commended me to
you.</P> </Q></P>
<P>I wrote a Petition for this unhappy Stranger; which had no manner
of Ef|fect on his Maje&s;ty: I afterwards wrote to her Brother-in-law; who gave
her Five Guineas, with which Sum &s;he again &s;et out for <HI>St.
Chri&s;tophers</HI>; and, as I after|wards <PB N="28" REF="51"> learne, the
Ship, with all the Pa&s;|&s;engers, were lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I think this poor Lady's Life was but a continual Scene of Storms
and Misfor|tunes, as if Heaven had 
<Q> 
<L>Bar'd her Bo&s;om to the Thunder&s;tone.</L></Q></P>
<P>But alas! how &s;hall we poor Reptiles pre&s;ume to judge the Ways
of Pro|vidence; all things are ordered with Har|mony and Beauty; though, like a
Fly, our feeble Ray &s;ees but an Inch around, yet dares di&s;like the
Structure of the Whole.</P>
<P>As well might a Mariner, in the mid&s;t of the wide World of
congregated Wa|ters, hope, with his Line, to &s;ound the deep Aby&s;s, as our
finite Minds to com|prehend the Ways of Deity. 
<Q> 
<L>Here then let us re&s;t,</L></Q> Whatever is, is right;
Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s govern all.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="52">Reader, have Patience with my Philo|&s;ophick
Whim&s;ies, which I mu&s;t &s;ome|times indulge: 'Tis frequent, in

<P>I always find in my&s;elf a &s;trong Incli|nation to Critici&s;m,
and, if I live to fini&s;h this Volume, I &s;hall certainly indulge it: For my
Part, let the World &s;ay what they plea&s;e of Criticks, I e&s;teem them as
very u&s;eful Members of the Common|wealth of Learning. Whatever is well
written will &s;tand the Te&s;t of &s;trict Exa|mination, ay, and of Ridicule
too; and when that is pa&s;t, the Work appears like Gold from the Furnace, with
ten-fold Lu&s;tre: Therefore I fairly invite the whole Body of Criticks to
canvas my Writings; if they point out an Error I &s;hall e&s;teem them as
Friends, and en|deavour to amend: If they make an in|judicious 
<PB N="33" REF="56"> Critici&s;m, for &s;ome &s;uch I have &s;een publi&s;h'd

<P>Well now, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> &s;ays, per|haps, my Reader,
What, in the Name of Wonder have we to do with all this?</P>
<P>Why, truly, no more, I think, than with a Buff Jerkin, or mine
Ho&s;te&s;s at <HI>St. Albans</HI>; but I am no Methodi&s;t either in Writing
or Religion; &s;ometimes Irregularities plea&s;e; &s;hapele&s;s Rock, or

<L>And half the Platform ju&s;t reflects the other.</L></Q> I am,
in &s;hort, an Heteroclite, or irre+gular Verb, which can never be declined, or
conjugated.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="57">But however, con&s;idering it was a Hi&s;|tory
of my&s;elf, I promi&s;ed to the World, I now proceed in it thus:</P>
<P>Two very fine young Gentlemen, whom I did not know, came to buy
&s;ome Prints, and ob&s;erving a large Book in Manu&s;cript, open before me,
one of them demanded, Was that my Account-Book? I a&s;&s;ured the Gentlemen, my
Re|venue was ea&s;ily ca&s;t up, and that I was but a bad Arithmetician, though
I fre|quently dealt in Figures and Numbers.</P>
<P>This Gentleman, whom I pre&s;ently after found was an Earl, by his
Com|panions calling him by his Title, in|&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing the Subject of
my Amu&s;ement. This was the Fir&s;t Vo|lume of my Work, which when once he had
began, he went quite through with, and gave it more Applau&s;e than ever an
Author's dear Partiality to their own Offspring could po&s;&s;ibly make me
believe it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>However, his Lord&s;hip made a ju&s;t Remark, That I was very fond
of intro|ducing <PB N="35" REF="58"> the Sun by way of Simile, in all my Poems,
and &s;aid, he had a Mind to cut it out where-ever he met it.</P>
<P>I told his Lord&s;hip, he would then leave my Book in the Land of
Dark|ne&s;s, and the Shadow of Death.</P>
<P>The Earl then a&s;ked me, if I intend|ed to print it? I &s;aid I
would, if I could get Sub&s;cribers to it, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t, like many
other valuable things, be bu|ried in Oblivion. He gave me a Sub|&s;cription,
and, as it was Dinner-time, took his Leave, with a Promi&s;e of drink|ing
Coffee with me the next Evening; when, as it was <HI>Sunday,</HI> I &s;hould be
di&s;|engaged from Bu&s;ine&s;s; which Promi&s;e, however, he did not fulfil;
and having vainly expected him till Eight, I then went up Stairs, to &s;it with
the Counte&s;s of <HI>Yarmouth</HI>'s Steward's Wife; and, on my Return, found
my Shop broke open, and every Article of my Wearing Ap|parel taken away: This
was a dreadful Mortification, and a &s;ad Lo&s;s! All my Comfort was, that the
Thieves had taken nothing but what belonged to me.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="59">This Robbery quite ruin'd me, as I was obliged
to lay out my Money for Nece&s;&s;aries to appear decent; my Land|lord &s;eiz'd
for a Quarter's Rent, though he was my Countryman, and profe&s;s'd great
Friend&s;hip for me.</P>
<P>I was once more in doleful Plight; however, I got a
ready-furni&s;h'd Lodg|ing, ju&s;t tolerable.</P>
<P>One Evening, when I came Home from a Friend's, my Landlady told
me, there was a young Woman to vi&s;it me, who wept &s;adly that I was abroad.
I a&s;k'd her what &s;ort of a Per&s;on &s;he was? She told me, &s;he thought
&s;he greatly re&s;embled me, and that &s;he would be with me early in the
Morning: Accord|ingly &s;he came, and I knew her, at fir&s;t Sight, to be my
Daughter: The Sur|prize made me faint away; not but I was very glad to &s;ee
her, but Joy is over|coming as Grief; and when I con&s;ider'd how little it was
in my Power to help her, it quite &s;urk my Spirits. She was in a Garb which
be&s;poke Poverty, and gave me <PB N="37" REF="60"> a long Account of her
Father's Inhuma|nity to her, and his younge&s;t Son.</P>
<P>A few Days after her Arrival came the Son I have now with me, from
on board a Privateer, as ragged as a Prodigal re|turn'd from keeping Swine;
but, poor Child, I wonder how he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at all, con&s;idering the
Hard&s;hips he had &s;uffer'd, and what to do with them both I could not tell:
Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of
<HI>Clari&s;&s;a.</HI></NOTE> was &s;o kind to give my Son a new Suit of
Clothes, which put him in a Capacity of going among&s;t my Friends, from whom I
received a tran&s;ient Relief.</P>
<P>At length the Girl, finding how Mat|ters were, went to wait on a
Lady, and Captain <HI>Meade</HI> took my Son with him on board a Man of War,
with which a Num|ber of Tran&s;ports, and others, then went on a &s;ecret
Expedition, but were pre|vented in their De&s;ign, by having their Intentions
betray'd to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Well, this was a little Re&s;pite to me: I heard
<HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> was in <HI>London,</HI> and wrote to him, but receiv'd no
An&s;wer; a Day <PB N="38" REF="61"> or two after, as I was going through
<HI>Spring-Garden,</HI> pretty early in the Morn|ing, who &s;hould I &s;ee but
the very iden|tical Man, &s;tanding at a Coffee-Hou&s;e Door!</P>
<P>I &s;top'd, and look'd at him, when he immediately recollected me,
and &s;eem'd over-joy'd to &s;ee me: He invited me to Breakfa&s;t, and told me,
he was upon his Keeping; &s;o that he had been obliged to quit a pretty
ready-furni&s;h'd Hou&s;e, he had in <HI>Mount-Street, Berkley-Square,</HI> and
leave it to the Care of a Servant, to retire to this privileg'd Place.</P>
<P>After Breakfa&s;t he de&s;ired I would write a Letter for him to
the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and to two others, whom I have now
forgot, to beg their Pro|tection; which accordingly he obtain'd, though not
directly. He made me dine with him, and promi&s;ed to reward me when he
&s;hould be at Liberty to pur&s;ue his Work; and, in the mean time, he &s;aid,
I &s;hould be welcome to his Hou&s;e in <HI>Mount-Street</HI>; an Offer which I
readily <PB N="39" REF="62"> accepted, as well for the fine Air, as be|ing
Rent-free.</P>
<P>He allow'd me a Shilling a Day to live on, which I could very well
do: But he came every Morning to know how much I had wrote. He would give me
Fifteen Subjects at once, and expected I &s;hould compo&s;e &s;omething
excellent on every one of them: In &s;hort, there was no End to my Labour, nor
any Relaxation from it, except &s;ometimes a kind of troubled Sleep; for,
among&s;t other Mi&s;|fortunes, I was not able to make my Bed, nor light the
Fire; and the old Woman, his Hou&s;e-keeper, proud, ig|norant, and in&s;olent
beyond Imagina|tion, a&s;k'd me, Where the Devil I was bred, that I could not
&s;weep Rooms, light Fires, and make Beds, as well as other Servants; and that
truly Mr. <HI>Wor&s;|dale</HI> was a Fool to hire me, who did no|thing but
write all Day long.</P>
<P>Though I conceiv'd a good deal of In|dignation at being thought
the Servant of a Colour-grinder's Son, yet I could not <PB N="40" REF="63">
forbear laughing at the Ideas of this good Creature.</P>
<P>Never did any Soul lead a more &s;oli|tary Life than poor
<HI>Laetitia</HI>; for <HI>Wor&s;|dale</HI> had po&s;itively order'd the old
Wo|man not to let any human Creature come near me; and &s;he punctually obey'd
him, more out of Malice than Inte|grity.</P>
<P>In this Seque&s;tration from the World I wrote three Ballad
Operas, one of them plan'd on the Story of the old Song, <HI>A Pennyworth of
Wit</HI>; where I have &s;o exalted the Wife over the Harlot, that at la&s;t,
as <HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> is a profe&s;t Libertine, I began to think it was quite
nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for his writing any thing to the Honour of Virtue,
or expo&s;ing of Vice; &s;o I wrote the following Epilogue, to be &s;poke by a
Woman: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>EPILOGUE to <HI>Virtue Triumphant.</HI></HEAD>
<L>DUce on't, I wonder what the Author means,</L>
<L>To pe&s;ter thus the Stage with moral Scenes!</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="64">The Fool! He &s;ent me hither to
excu&s;e him;</L>
<L>Faith I'll be even with him, and abu&s;e him.</L>
<L>I hope he li&s;tens, while I &s;peak my Thoughts</L>
<L>And tell, what he mu&s;t bear to hear, his Faults.</L>
<L>Fir&s;t he endeavours, in a free-born Na|tion,</L>
<L>To bring the wearing Fetters into Fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>Nor would have loving Couples go toge|ther,</L>
<L>Till they are yok'd by matrimonial tether.</L>
<L>Here he does plainly Liberty invade,</L>
<L>And is, be&s;ides an Enemy to Trade:</L>
<L>Should his Advice be follow'd thro' the Land,</L>
<L>What mu&s;t became of <HI>Drury,</HI> and the
<HI>Strand</HI>?</L>
<L>In <HI>France,</HI> when Age appears thro' Walls of
Paint,</L>
<L>Each batter'd Jade turns Devot&egrave;, or Saint;</L>
<L>And, when her Looks no longer Love in|&s;pire,</L>
<L>Does wi&s;ely to a Nunnery retire:</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="65">But here &s;hould pretty Females leave
off &s;inning,</L>
<L>What mu&s;t they do? betake them&s;elves to Spinning!</L>
<L>Why, &s;ure, 'twou'd vex the Heart of <HI>Jew,</HI> or

<L>To &s;ee the pretty playful Creatures work.</L>
<L>Well, after all his railing thus at Harlots,</L>
<L>'Tis &s;aid, he lik'd them once, by lying Var|lets;</L>
<L>And that, unle&s;s be perfectly had known 'em,</L>
<L>He never cou'd &s;o perfectly have &s;hewn 'em.</L>
<L>But, Je&s;ts apart, the Poet bad me &s;ay,</L>

<L>Yet Virtue &s;hall, at la&s;t, triumphant prove,</L>

</LG> </Q></P>
<P>I am &s;orry I have not the Opera, but <HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> was too
cunning for me, and &s;eiz'd it, &s;heet by Sheet, as fa&s;t as I wrote it: And
having now Liberty, by means of the Protection, and a good deal of Work
be&s;poke in the City, he took a Floor near the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> in a
large old-fa&s;hion'd Hou&s;e, with very antique Furniture; and there he gave
me a little Room to my&s;elf; but, as it was within-&s;ide of his
Painting-room, I was a Pri|&s;oner all the Morning, and might fa&s;t and write
till Three o'Clock in the Day; then I was called to Dinner, of Beef-&s;teaks,
or Mutton-chops, cook'd by him|&s;elf: The manner of our eating I mu&s;t
de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>We had four Play-bills laid for a Table-cloth, Knives, Forks, or
Plates, had we none; no matter for that&mdash;
<Q><PB N="44" REF="67"> 
<L>I had a Blade,</L> 
<L>With which my tuneful Pens were made&mdash;</L> 
<L>And, &s;o to make my Dinner &s;ure,</L> 
<L>I for a Fork employ'd a Skewer.</L></Q> The Butter, when we
had any, was de|po&s;ited in the cool and fragrant Rece&s;s of an old Shoe, a
Coffee-pot of mine &s;erved for as many U&s;es as ever <HI>Scrub</HI> had, for
&s;ometimes it boil'd Coffee, &s;ometimes Tea, it brought &s;mall Beer,
&s;trong Beer, and I am more than half afraid it has been applied to le&s;s
noble U&s;es; but be that as it may, I've done the Man &s;ome Service, and he
knows it&mdash;No more of that.</P>
<P>He happened to paint, as he told me, the young Chevalier's
Picture, at <HI>Man|che&s;ter.</HI> As he went to <HI>Richmond</HI> he left all
his Pictures in my Care, when, one Morning, a very beautiful young Lady, of
about Sixteen, and her Brother, a fine young Gentleman, came to the Hou&s;e: I
was called down, and they walk'd up Stairs; when, after a little He&s;itation, 
<PB N="45" REF="68"> the Lady a&s;k'd me, could &s;he &s;ee the Picture of the
Highlander? I an&s;wered, yes, and brought it to her: She ki&s;s'd the Face,
Feet, and every Bit of it; and judging from this that &s;he was a Roman
Catholick, a Religion that 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Lucan,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the
Earl of <HI>Kil|malock.</HI></NOTE><HI>Patrick Sar&s;|field</HI>'s Neice can
never hate, let who will take Offence at it; for he was generous, noble, and
humane; and, in God's Name, let every one of his Creatures be as up|right and
ju&s;t as he, (and no Doubt but he will look down well pleas'd, and ble&s;s the
fair Variety).</P>
<P>The young Lady repeated two Lines of a Poem of Lady <HI>Mary
Wortley Mon|tague,</HI> on &s;eeing this Picture: 
<Q> 
<L>In ev'ry Linament of which we trace</L> 
<L>The injur'd Saint, and Royal Martyr's Face.</L></Q></P>
<P>Their Curio&s;ity being &s;atisfied, the Lady would have given me
&s;ome Money: I told her, I was not a Servant, but that, as I lodged in the
Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> left the Pictures in my Care: Madam, 
<PB N="46" REF="69"> &s;ays &s;he, I beg Pardon; but how can I make you a
Recompence for your Trou|ble? By giving me, Madam, the Re|mainder of the Poem:
She repeated it; and, finding I had &s;omething like Ta&s;te, &s;he kindly
embraced me, giving me a Direction where to wait on her; and we parted, I
believe, delighted with each other; but I only &s;peak for my&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> came to Town, and called on this Lady, and
Gentleman: They were &s;o kind to prai&s;e me highly, and a&s;k him, who I was?
He declared he did not know; he left, he &s;aid, an old Chairwoman to look
after his Hou&s;e, perhaps it was &s;he.&mdash;</P>
<P>This An&s;wer did not &s;atisfy them, they were &s;o
unrea&s;onable as to in&s;i&s;t on it, that I was a Gentlewoman, that they knew
it by my Speech, and Hands, by my refu&s;ing Money, and begging Poetry: But
<HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> renounced me more heartily than ever he did the Devil,
who&s;e Ser|vant he is.&mdash;</P>
<P>He came home very angry, abu&s;ed me at an unmerciful rate, and
told me, I <PB N="47" REF="70"> &s;hould not &s;tay in his Hou&s;e, to &s;hew
my Wit and Breeding, for&s;ooth, when I had neither; and boa&s;t of my Family,
when it would have been better for me to have been the Daughter of a Cobler. As
this Fellow always boa&s;ted of his being Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s
Ba&s;tard, I could not avoid telling him, that &s;ome People were &s;o fond of
Family, that, to keep it up, they would prove them&s;elves Sons of Whores.</P>
<P>The Hour of my Deliverance, from this wor&s;e than
<HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, now approach'd; a young Woman, for whom I had wrote
&s;everal Love-Letters to a Gentleman who had, it &s;eems, kept her till he
married, and then for&s;ook her, as indeed he ought, found me out.</P>
<P>The Scheme was to per&s;uade him, that at the Time he
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, &s;he was with Child by him, though &s;he in Reality
confe&s;t &s;he was never in that Circum|&s;tance in her Life: But, Bite the
Biter was fair enough; if he cheated her out of Innocence (a Lo&s;s never to be
retriev'd) I think &s;he had a ju&s;t Title to &s;ome of <PB N="48" REF="71">
his Money, of which he had more than he knew how to u&s;e.</P>
<P>I was writing a melancholy Epi&s;tle for her, when in came
<HI>Wor&s;dale</HI>; he gave me a furious Look, and withered all my Strength
before he &s;poke; then he went out of the Chamber, and &s;ent for me,
demanding of me, whether I intended to neglect his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and turn
Secretary for the Whores. I was really &s;urpri|&s;ed, that he of all Men,
&s;hould fall &s;o hard on kind Females; and as their Mo|ney was hone&s;tly
earn'd by me, and they are generally liberal, I never thought I did any thing
ami&s;s, in helping them out with a &s;oft Epi&s;tle: He &s;torm'd at me, &s;he
heard him, and finding his Wrath was rai&s;ed on her Account, was very much
troubled, and &s;lipping a Guinea into my Hand &s;oftly, whi&s;pered me to come
to her Hou&s;e in <HI>Golden-&s;quare,</HI> and &s;he would make me full amends
for my Vexation.&mdash;Of all Men I ever &s;aw, <HI>W&mdash;e</HI> has the
&s;tronge&s;t Appearance of Charity and Compa&s;&s;ion, and the lea&s;t of it
in reality. He would take any curious <PB N="49" REF="72"> Arti&s;t out of
trouble, provided their Work, which he appropriated to him&s;elf, would yield
him ten-fold Intere&s;t. Love, Favour, or even common Decency, no Per&s;on ever
met with from him, except on terms of becoming his Slave. I have often
reflected with Wonder, on the va&s;t Propen&s;ity that appears in Per&s;ons of
Quality, to provide for the &s;purious Off|&s;pring of Beggars, Vagrants,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> by de|priving them&s;elves of the Enjoyments of Life, to
ama&s;s va&s;t Trea&s;ure, and when that tremendous Hour arrives, in which all
earthly Glories, Honours, Wealth, and Titles, cannot give a Moment's Ea&s;e, or
prolong frail Life, the Que&s;tion is, 
<Q REND="inline">"How &s;hall I di&s;po&s;e of this, to appea&s;e
that God, at who&s;e Tribunal I expect &s;hortly to appear? Oh! I'll leave it
all to the Poor."</Q>&mdash;As if the Omnipo|tent could not &s;ee through the
&s;hallow Device, or that his eternal Kingdom was to be purcha&s;ed with their
Leavings.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who have cho&s;en to be
publick &s;pirited after their Death, have in their Life|time 
<PB N="50" REF="73"> been meer unho&s;pitable narrow hearted Souls; and if a
Per&s;on of Birth and polite Education, had by any Mis|fortune fallen into
Di&s;tre&s;s, and made an Application to them, &s;uch would not fail of meeting
with an Affront, and having their Letter &s;ent back open, with the Civil
Me&s;&s;age, that truly my Lord or my Lady did not know any Thing of it, and
had Dependants enough of their own to provide for.</P>
<P>And pray now let us enquire, who are the&s;e Poor, that the
publick and private are eternally providing for; are there not Collections
daily in Churches, be&s;ides the va&s;t Legacies left to Pari&s;hes,
Ho&s;pitals, &amp;c. and yet to Appearance no Soul the better.</P>
<P>Are not the Streets infe&s;ted with Beg|gars of all Denominations?
and in the Hou&s;es, Objects that would rai&s;e Com|pa&s;&s;ion in any humane,
well-judging Per&s;on?</P>
<P>Here we &s;hall find a poor Wretch, for a few Shillings a Week,
&s;laving to &s;upport a Wife and Children, and perhaps <PB N="51" REF="74"> at
the End of the Quarter, is &s;tripped by a cruel Landlord, and torn
relentle&s;ly from the Relief of his Family, while they are expo&s;ed to the
&s;harpe&s;t Pangs of Want, Cold and Nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P>And where &s;hall they apply for Relief? if to the Pari&s;h,

dine or &s;up with her, they mu&s;t take &s;uch as the Hou&s;e affords, by

<P>Dean SWIFT's excellent Scheme for building an Ho&s;pital for
Lunaticks and <PB N="53" REF="76"> Idiots, was of a different Ca&s;t from
tho&s;e of mo&s;t other Men, as it was not a Mat|ter utter'd with his la&s;t
Breath, but &s;tu|died, calculated, and determined for many Years before, as
the following Lines in his Elegy on his own Death &s;ufficiently evince. 
<Q> 
<L>He left the little Wealth he had,</L> 
<L>To build a Hou&s;e, for Fools and Mad,</L> 
<L>And &s;hew'd by one Satyrick Touch,</L> 
<L>No Nation wanted it &s;o much.</L></Q> And according to his
u&s;ual Wi&s;dom, he committed the Regulation of it to Gen|tlemen of real
Worth, Honour, and Pro|bity, in which, would others follow &s;o great, &s;o
laudable an Example, perhaps the many Sums that were de&s;igned for good 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. The Work-Hou&s;e in
<HI>Dublin.</HI></NOTE>U&s;es, but are now appropriated to the purcha&s;ing
E&s;tates, and &s;plendid Equipages for &s;ome particular People, might have
the wi&s;h'd Effect of being a univer&s;al Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="77">The <HI>Dean</HI> could not abide the thought
of being like other Mortals, forgot as &s;oon as his venerable Du&s;t was
convey'd to the Earth; and therefore he always endeavour'd to render him&s;elf
worthy of a grateful Remembrance in the Hearts of the People; yet how true are
his own Lines!</P>
<Q> 
<L>And now the Dean no more is mi&s;s'd,</L> 
<L>Than if he never did exi&s;t;</L> 
<L>Except among&s;t old-fa&s;hioned Folks,</L>

<P>A remarkable In&s;tance of his whim&s;ical Di&s;po&s;ition, which

<Q> 
<L>His &s;acred Name remains &s;till dear,</L> 
<L>To every ju&s;t Hibernian Ear;</L></Q> I will here in&s;ert,
and mu&s;t &s;ay, 'tis with infinite Plea&s;ure, I find that my weak Attempts
to delineate his inimitable Cha|racter, have met with &s;uch unhoped
Ap|probation, both here and in <HI>England</HI>; <PB N="55" REF="78"> not &s;o
much for the Vanity of an Author, as the Plea&s;ure I feel at &s;eeing &s;o
va&s;t a Re&s;pect paid to his Memory.</P>
<P>I believe the <HI>Dean</HI> on his fir&s;t coming to
<HI>Ireland,</HI> was very melancholy, and indeed it was not to be wonder'd at,
as he was then &s;eparated from tho&s;e whom he lov'd, Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> Lord
<HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> &amp;c. and in one of his Poems, he &s;eems to de&s;pair
of meeting with Friend&s;hip in a &s;trange Country, or that, 
<Q> 
<L>Not a Judas could be found,</L> 
<L>To &s;ell him for three Hundred Pound.</L></Q> I one Day
a&s;k'd him how he came to write that Poem; he told me he had three Times like
to have been hang'd, 
<Q REND="inline">"and, Pox take me, &s;aid he, but I be|lieve the
People thought I could bring the Pretender in my Hand, and place him on the
Throne."</Q></P>
<P>I remember a worthy Gentleman, who had the Honour of his
Acquaintance, told me, that the Dean and &s;ome other Per|&s;ons of Ta&s;te,
whom I do not now re|collect, <PB N="56" REF="79"> came to a Re&s;olution to
have a Fea&s;t once a Year, in imitation of the <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> which, in
heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> was held about the Time we keep our
<HI>Chri&s;t|mas,</HI> whereat the Servants per&s;onated their Ma&s;ters, and
the Ma&s;ters waited as Servants.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Time they put this Scheme in Practice, was at the
Deanery Hou&s;e. When all the Servants were &s;eated, and every Gentleman
placed behind his own Man, the Dean's Servant took an Op|portunity of finding
Fault with &s;ome Meat that was not done to his Ta&s;te, and tak|ing it up in
his Hand, he threw it in his Ma&s;ter's Face, and mimick'd him in every other
Foible which he had ever di&s;cover'd in him.</P>
<P>At this the Dean flew in a violent Rage, beat the Fellow, and put
every Thing into &s;uch Di&s;order, that the Servants affright|ed, fled the
Room; and here ended the Fea&s;t of <HI>Saturnalia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stella,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>John&s;on,</HI>
&s;aid to be his own Si&s;ter.</NOTE> whom he has &s;o beautifully prai&s;ed
through his Writings, was actu|ally <PB N="57" REF="80"> his Wife, though they
never, I am convinced, ta&s;ted even the cha&s;te Joys which Hymen allows.</P>
<P>It is certain, they retain'd for each other, a mo&s;t tender Love;
and though they did not indulge the De&s;ires of the Body, yet their Souls were
united by the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds of divine and &s;ocial Har|mony.</P>
<P>He, in the latter Part of his Life, of|fered to acknowledge her as
the Partner of his Heart; but &s;he wi&s;ely declin'd it, knowing that while
&s;he continued only as a Vi&s;itor, he would treat her with Re&s;|pect; which
would cea&s;e, as his Temper was unpa&s;&s;ive, if &s;he lived intirely with
him; and every Fault of his Servants would be attributed to her. I am certain
he mu&s;t have tenderly loved that Lady, as I have been a Witne&s;s, that the
bare mention of her Name has drawn Tears from him, which it was not ea&s;y to
ef|fect.</P>
<P>I remember he &s;ent for me one Morn|ing very early, to
Breakfa&s;t; and as I always drank Tea or Coffee, I expected 
<PB N="58" REF="81"> to have found one of the&s;e ready; but after he had
detained me two Hours, di&s;|cour&s;ing on his Hou&s;hold Oeconomy, and other
Matters, among&s;t which one was, that a Piece of his Garden Wall had fallen
down; and 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;o &s;aid he,"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"one of my Fellows for&s;ooth, mu&s;t needs get a
Trowel and Mortar, and undertake to mend the Breach.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"I happened, continued the Dean, to &s;py him out
of my Window at this Employment, and call'd to him to know why he did that? he
told me he had been bred a Bricklayer, and that his doing it, would &s;ave me
Mo|ney; &s;o I let him fini&s;h it, which he did very compleatly in about an
Hour's time. I gave him a Moidore; and Pox take me, but the Fellow in&s;tead of
going as he ought, to the Alehou&s;e or a Whore, went and bought Silver
Buckles, and is grown very proud upon it."</Q></P>
<P>I think, Sir, &s;aid I, the Man made a good Hour's Work of it.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="82"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Come &s;aid he, &s;hall we go to Break|fa&s;t, I
know you were once <HI>Bermudas</HI> mad; now I'll give you &s;ome of that
Country Cheer; <HI>open</HI> that Drawer and reach me a flat Bottle you'll find
there."</Q> I ran to obey him, and as the Drawer was low, kneeled down to
it.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner attempted to unlock the Drawer, but he flew at me
and beat me mo&s;t immoderately; I again made an Effort, and &s;till he beat
me, crying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Pox take you, <HI>open</HI> the Drawer."</Q> I
once more tried, and he &s;truck me &s;o hard, that I bur&s;t into Tears, and
&s;aid, Lord, Sir, what mu&s;t I do?</P>
<P>Pox take you for a Slut, &s;aid he, 
<Q REND="inline">"would you &s;poil my Lock, and break my Key?"</Q>
Why, Sir the Drawer is lock'd. 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! I beg Pardon, &s;aid he, I thought you were
going to pull it out by the Key; well, open it and do what I bid you."</Q></P>
<P>I did &s;o, and found the Bottle. 
<Q REND="inline">"Now &s;aid he,"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t know I always breakfa&s;t between my
own Hou&s;e and the Church, and I carry my Provi&s;ion <PB N="60" REF="83"> in
my Pocket,"</Q> upon this he pulled out a Piece of Gingerbread, and offered me
&s;ome.</P>
<P>As I was terribly afflicted with the Heart-burn, the very thoughts
of any thing &s;o dry, made me ten times wor&s;e, which I told him, and begged
he would excu&s;e me. He po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted on my eating a Piece of it,
which I was, on Penalty of another Beating, obliged to comply with.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Now, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t take a Sup out of my
Bottle."</Q> I ju&s;t held it to my Mouth, and found it &s;o &s;trong, that I
intreated he would not a&s;k me to ta&s;te it: He endeavoured to per&s;uade me;
but finding that would not avail, he threw me down, forced the Bottle into my
Mouth, and pour'd &s;ome of the Liquor down my Throat, which I thought would
have &s;et my very Stomach on Fire. He then gravely went to Prayers, and I
re|turned home, not greatly delighted, but, however, glad to come off no
wor&s;e. I went the en&s;uing. Evening to pay a Vi|&s;it to my Kin&s;man Doctor
<HI>S&mdash;ge,</HI> <PB N="61" REF="84"> then lately con&s;ecrated Lord
B&mdash;p of ****. This Gentleman, and his Family, were extremely fond of my
Fa|ther, and always plea&s;ed when I did my|&s;elf the Honour to call on them;
and received me with that Ea&s;e and Polite|ne&s;s, peculiar to well bred
People. I con|gratulated the Bi&s;hop on his Preferment: He mode&s;tly told me,
that his Honours did not &s;it ea&s;y on him, and that he would willingly
di&s;pence with his Friends not &s;aluting him by his Title of Lord, as it
always made him unea&s;y. He then a&s;ked me, as he &s;aw my Father's Cha|riot
at the Door, where I intended to go? I told him, to the Dean. Well, &s;aid he,
I beg you'll give my Compliments to him, and tell him, That, as 'tis to his
Recommendation I owe my pre&s;ent Hap|pine&s;s, I am &s;urpri&s;ed I never had
the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him &s;ince he con|ferred &s;o great a Favouron me:
While I was plain Doctor <HI>S&mdash;ge,</HI> continued he, the Dean u&s;ed to
&s;end his Wine and Bread before him, and frequently take a Dinner with me; but
now, I believe, he is <PB N="62" REF="85"> a&s;ham'd to own me: Pray &s;peak to
him, and let me know his An&s;wer. I pro|mi&s;ed I would, and then
departed.</P>
<P>I found the Dean at home, and alone, which gave me an immediate
Opportu|nity of delivering the B&mdash;p's Me&s;|&s;age. He li&s;ten'd to me
very attentively, and then &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, I remember &s;ome|thing of it: L&mdash;d
<HI>C&mdash;t</HI> ap|plied to me for a Per&s;on to make a Bi&s;hop of, whom I
knew was not an hone&s;t Man; and, as I wanted the Living of
<HI>W&mdash;b</HI>'s for <HI>D&mdash;y,</HI> I recommended <HI>S&mdash;ge</HI>
to the Bi&s;hoprick, with an A&s;&s;urance, that he would an&s;wer his
Excellency's Pur|po&s;e; and Pox take me if I ever thought him worth my
Contempt, till I had made a Bi&s;hop of him."</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then told me, that as he had no Company, and did not know
how to di&s;po&s;e of his time, I &s;hould have the Honour to &s;up with him;
and, &s;aid he, I will give you a mo&s;t kingly En|tertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="86">I accordingly waited, in Expectation of &s;ome
extraordinary Repa&s;t, till about Nine o'Clock, in which Interval, my Readers
may be a&s;&s;ured, I wanted not Amu&s;ements for the Mind: However, at length,
the Cloth was laid on a &s;mall Table, and, to my great Surprize, the Servant
brought up four blue Eggs, on a China Plate: 
<Q REND="inline">"Here, Hu&s;&s;ey, &s;aid he, is a Plover's Egg;
King <HI>William</HI> u&s;ed to give Crowns apiece for them, and thought it
Prophanation in a Subject to eat one of them; as he was, among&s;t his other
immortal Perfections, an Epicure, a Glutton, and a&mdash;Hold, &s;aid he, I had
like to have &s;poken Trea&s;on: But how do you like the Eggs?"</Q> Sir, I have
eat none yet. 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, eat like a Monarch then, and tell me your
Opinion."</Q> I did eat, and told him, I had not that elevated Notion of his
Banquet, which he might po&s;&s;ibly have, from &s;o great a Precedent. 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;aid he, the&s;e Eggs co&s;t me Six-pence
apiece, which is a little extravagant, con&s;idering a Herring will co&s;t but
a <PB N="64" REF="87"> Halfpenny; but I never exceed two; and this is the only
Article in which I am luxurious."</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here again apologize to my Reader for my frequent
Digre&s;&s;ions, in which, however, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, they will find more
Entertainment than a &s;imple Narrative will afford.</P>
<P>I believe there never was any Set of People &s;o happy in
&s;incere and uninter|rupted Friend&s;hip, as the Dean, Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> and my&s;elf; nor can I reflect, at this Hour, on any
thing with more Plea&s;ure, than tho&s;e happy Moments we have enjoyed! 'Tis
for this Rea&s;on I am fond of mentioning Matters; which bring the plea&s;ing
Ideas to my Mind. I have ob&s;erved, that the Scent of a Flower, or the Tune of
a Song, al|ways conveys to Remembrance the exact Image of the Place in which
they were fir&s;t noticed. Well, therefore, in the Relation of a Story, where
one Circum|&s;tance in&s;en&s;ibly brings on another, may a Writer, who
&s;corns to deal in Romance, be led, like me, to digre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="88">Mrs. <HI>Barber,</HI> who&s;e Name, at her
earne&s;t Reque&s;t, I omitted in my fir&s;t Volume, and who was the Lady I
mentioned to have been with me, at my fir&s;t Interview with the Dean at Dr.
<HI>Delany</HI>'s Seat, was at this time writing a Volume of Poems, &s;ome of
which I fan&s;y might, at this Day, be &s;een in the Chee&s;emongers,
Chandlers, Pa&s;try-cooks, and Second-hand Book-&s;ellers Shops: However, dull
as they were, they certainly would have been much wor&s;e, but that Doctor
<HI>Delany</HI> fre|quently held what he called a <HI>Senatus Con&s;ultum,</HI>
to correct the&s;e undige&s;ted Materials; at which were pre&s;ent &s;ome|times
the Dean, (in the Chair) but al|ways Mrs. <HI>Grier&s;on,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Pilkington,</HI> the Doctor, and my&s;elf. One Day that he had appointed
for this Purpo&s;e, we re|ceived from him the following Lines, which, as they
contain a Compliment to me, from &s;o eminent a Hand, I mu&s;t in&s;ert: Take
notice, that as we were both diminutive in Size, Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> was
&s;tiled <HI>Thomas Thumb,</HI> and I his Lady fair: 
<Q><PB N="66" REF="89">

<L>Flow Wit to her Honour, flow Wine to her Health,</L> 
<L>High rais'd be her Worth, above Titles or Wealth.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="90">We obeyed the Summons, and had a very elegant
Entertainment; and after|wards proceeded to our Bu&s;ine&s;s, which we
completed, to the Satisfaction of all Parties.</P>
<P>Of all the Gentlemen I ever knew, this I mu&s;t &s;ay, that Doctor
<HI>Delany</HI> ex|cels in one Point particularly; which is, in giving an
elegant Entertainment, with Ea&s;e, Chearfulne&s;s, and an Ho&s;pitality, which
makes the Company happy.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Carteret,</HI> in his Lieutenancy, be|ing very fond of
this Gentleman, who is indeed worthy of univer&s;al E&s;teem, came one Day,
quite unattended, and told the Doctor he was come to dine with him. He thank'd
his Excellency for the Honour he confer'd on him, and invited him to walk into
his (beautiful) Gardens; which his Excellency did, with great good Hu|mour.
They took a Turn or two, when the Servant came to inform them, that Dinner was
on the Table. The Doctor had generally &s;omething nice, in the Sea|&s;on, for
him&s;elf and his Mother, to whom he behaved with true filial Tenderne&s;s 
<PB N="68" REF="91"> and Re&s;pect; for which, no Doubt, his Days will be long
in the Land, which the Lord hath given him.</P>
<P>The Doctor made the old Lady do the Honours of his Table; for
which, nor for the Entertainment, he never made the lea&s;t Apology, but told
his Lord&s;hip, that 
<Q> 
<L>To Stomachs cloy'd with co&s;tly Fare,</L> 
<L>Simplicity alone was rare.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Demeanor of his was infinitely agreeable to Lord
<HI>C&mdash;t,</HI> who, tho' a Courtier, hated Ceremony when he &s;ought
Plea&s;ure, which is indeed incon|&s;i&s;tent with it. And what Re&s;pect
&s;o|ever our Nobility may think is owing to the <HI>French</HI> Mode of
cringing and com|plimenting, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never &s;ee it practi&s;ed,
without a peculiar Pain, which I can compare to nothing but the
Appre|hen&s;ions I am under at the Sight of Tumblers, Rope-dancers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch as, I believe, all rational Creatures &s;hare, at
&s;eeing Men deform their Vi&s;ages by a <PB N="69" REF="92"> thou&s;and
aukward Grimaces, and their Bodies like jointed Babies, only becau&s;e it is
Alamode Francoi&s;e: Neither do we often &s;ee any but the mo&s;t illiterate
Cox|combs practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>His Excellency, after the Cloth was taken away and the Bottle
introduced, (when con&s;equently, the Lady departed) told the Doctor, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he always be|lieved him a mo&s;t well-bred
Gentle|man, but never had &s;o clear a Demon|&s;tration of it, as he had this
Day &s;een. Others, &s;aid he, whom I have tried the &s;ame Experiment on, have
met me in as much Confu&s;ion as if I came to arre&s;t them for High-Trea&s;on;
nay, they would not give me a Moment of their Conver&s;ation; which, and not
their Dinner, I &s;ought, but hurry from me; and then, if I had any Appetite,
deprive me of it by their ful&s;ome Apo|logies for Defects. This, &s;aid his
Ex|cellency, is like a Story I heard the Dean tell of a Lady, who had given him
an Invitation to Dinner: As &s;he heard he was not ea&s;ily plea&s;ed, &s;he
had ta|ken <PB N="70" REF="93"> a Month to provide for it. When the Time came,
every Delicacy which could be purcha&s;ed, the Lady had prepared, even to
Profu&s;ion, (which you know <HI>Swift</HI> hated.) However, the Dean was
&s;carce &s;eated, when &s;he began to make a ceremonious Ha|rangue; in which
&s;he told him, that &s;he was &s;incerely &s;orry &s;he had not a more
tolerable Dinner, &s;ince &s;he was apprehen&s;ive there was not any thing
there fit for him to eat; in &s;hort, that it was a bad Dinner: <HI>Pox take
you for a B&mdash;,</HI> &s;aid the Dean, <HI>why did you not get a better?
Sure you had Time enough! but &s;ince you &s;ay it is &s;o bad, I'll e'en go
Home and eat a Herring.</HI> Accordingly he departed, and left her ju&s;tly
confu&s;ed at her Folly, which had &s;poilt all the Pains and Expence &s;he had
been at."</Q></P>
<P>And here, if it will not be thought im|pertinent in me, to intrude
into &s;uch Company, I al&s;o have a Story, which I &s;omewhere heard, not
unapplicable to the above.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="94">A certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobleman, who had
the Honour to be &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France,</HI> was &s;aid to be one
of the mo&s;t polite accompli&s;hed fine Gentlemen in <HI>Europe.</HI> This
reached the Ears of the <HI>French</HI> King, who thought &s;uch a Cha|racter
due to none but him&s;elf; but as every thing is proved by Trial, his
Ma|je&s;ty took this Method of informing his Curio&s;ity. One Morning that the
Amba&s;|&s;ador had a private Audience, the King told him he &s;hould be glad
of his Excel|lency's Company, to take an airing with him; the Amba&s;&s;ador
did not he&s;itate on accepting the Offer; but told his Maje&s;ty, he was ready
to wait on him; the King's Chariot was at the Door, which he very carele&s;sly
de&s;ired the Nobleman to &s;tep into: <HI>No, Sir,</HI> replied the
Amba&s;&s;ador, <HI>not before your Maje&s;ty</HI>; at which the King bur&s;t
out a Laughing, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"No, no, my Lord, you are not the be&s;t bred Man
in the World; otherwi&s;e you would have done what I de&s;ired, &s;ince you
might well know, that if it was not agreeable to me, I &s;hould ne|ver 
<PB N="72" REF="95"> have paid you the Compli|ment."</Q></P>
<P>And indeed I have heard tho&s;e who ought to be the be&s;t Judges
of Manners, declare, that in Company with Superiors, to act implicitly
according to their Direc|tions, is the mo&s;t effectual Method of being always
acceptable; which leads me to another little Circum&s;tance related by Mrs.
<HI>Percival.</HI></P>
<P>This Lady, with a Company of very agreeable Per&s;ons, re&s;olved
in the Sum|mer-time to take a Trip to the <HI>Hague</HI>; they accordingly
&s;et out, and landed at &s;ome Place in <HI>Holland,</HI> the Name of which I
have now forgot: However, on their fir&s;t Day's Journey, they &s;topp'd at an
Inn to dine, and enquired what they could have to eat; they were told there was
nothing in the Hou&s;e but a Neck of Veal; which, tho' in&s;ufficient, they
de|&s;ired to be dre&s;&s;ed, as there was not an Inn for &s;ome Miles forward;
therefore they made it up with &s;ome of their Sea Provi&s;ions, which the
Servants had for|tunately brought in. After Dinner they <PB N="73" REF="96">
called a Bill, and among&s;t other Articles of Extortion, they were charged for
Meat One Pound Four Shillings, which was &s;o palpable an Impo&s;ition, that
tho' each of the Company had Fortune and Liberality enough, yet they called for
the Man, and told him they ab&s;olutely would not pay &s;o extravagant a Price;
&s;ooner than which, as they came meerly for Plea&s;ure, they would &s;tay a
Month and &s;pend a hundred Pounds a Piece in Law; the Boori&s;h Fellow told
them that it was the common Price in this Place; which if they doubted, he was
willing to ap|peal to the Magi&s;trate. This they rea|dily agreed to, and were
all preparing for a &s;erious Trial of the Matter, when Minheer told them, in
an ironical Tone, that he was him&s;elf the Ruling-Officer and Di&s;pen&s;er of
Law and Ju&s;tice in that Place. Finding this to be the Fact, and that the
Defendant mu&s;t be the Judge in this Cau&s;e, the Plaintiffs thought proper to
&s;ubmit, and pay'd him.</P>
<P>If the Reader thinks this little Narra|tive is not quite in Point;
which, now it is related, I begin to find out my&s;elf, <PB N="74" REF="97"> he
may blot it out of his Book if he plea&s;es, but he &s;hall not blot it out of

<P>My dear Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> to whom, for his Amu&s;ement, I
u&s;ed to relate &s;uch little Incidents, would frequently admire what a Fund
of Matter for Entertainment my Brain contained, and he bad me write it all;
&s;ince, if it plea&s;ed him, it might po&s;&s;ibly have the &s;ame Effect on
others. This Gentleman's frequent Con|ver&s;ation with the Great, gave him a
bet|ter Opportunity of knowing their Di&s;po|&s;ition (as he had infinite
Penetration) than mo&s;t others: In Con&s;equence of which, he advi&s;ed me,
when I ever had Occa&s;ion to &s;ollicit a Favour from any Per&s;ons of
Di&s;tinction, to take Care to Time it properly; for In&s;tance, &s;aid he,
"Never write to him or her, of a dark foggy fro&s;ty Morning; particularly
be|fore Breakfa&s;t, at which Time it is Ten <PB N="75" REF="98"> to One, they
are out of Temper; nor though you &s;end at any Time, and even received an
unmannerly An&s;wer, do not let a ra&s;h Pride drive you to return the Affront,
&s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to know what at that In&s;tant had
chagrin'd their Temper. He who will not be your Friend at one Time, may at
another; and tho' you never can bring him to do you any Service, yet do not
provoke him to be your Enemy; a Man may have had ill Succe&s;s at Play,
mi&s;&s;ed an Appointment with a fine Woman, or twenty &s;uch Accidents; which
may for the pre&s;ent &s;our his Di&s;po&s;ition; whereas if you continue your
A&s;&s;iduities, in Pro|ce&s;s of Time he might do you more Service than you
could hope. The&s;e are Truths which I have &s;ince experienced, and I &s;hould
be wanting in Gratitude as well as Sincerity, if I did not make it publick.
Here follows an In&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Loftus Hume,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> whom I mentioned
in my &s;econd Volume, that came to &s;ee me in <HI>London,</HI> but declined
&s;ub&s;cribing to me, becau&s;e he was going to the Duke of
<HI>Dor&s;el</HI>'s to Dinner, has <PB N="76" REF="99"> &s;ince my being in
this Kingdom, been kind enough to &s;end me Five Guineas as a Sub&s;cription;
for which I re&s;t his mo&s;t obliged Servant.</P>
<P>I remark'd to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> upon this Conver&s;ation, that
though the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility were outdone by none in Mu|nificence and
Liberality; yet I could by no Means conceive, that their Buildings were the
lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of it; &s;ince there was &s;carcely one fine Hou&s;e in
<HI>London,</HI> which was not ob&s;cured by a mon&s;trous high Wall, that
intirely intercepted the Pro&s;pect, and took much from the Mag|nificence the
Streets might po&s;&s;ibly have. He told me, it was the Method in
<HI>Italy,</HI> from whence our Peers, and others, tran&s;|planted it as a
great Beauty, becau&s;e the Surpri&s;e has a va&s;t Effect. Sir, &s;aid I, in
<HI>Italy</HI> tho&s;e Walls are requi&s;ite, to keep off the extreme Heat of
the Sun; and if po&s;&s;ible to &s;hut out the Eye of God from their abominable
Pollutions; but as we enjoy a mild and temperate Region, and are I hope,
untainted with their bea&s;tly Vices, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on for our Peers to
affect it; there is be&s;ides, generally at <PB N="77" REF="100"> the&s;e

&s;o much dims their Lu&s;tre, as the Arrogance and Pe|nury of their
Va&s;&s;als; which, when they know, perhaps they may reclaim. Dean
<HI>Swift</HI> di&s;charged a Servant only for rejecting the Petition of a poor
old Wo|man; &s;he was very ancient, and on a cold Morning, &s;at at the Deanery
Steps a con|&s;iderable Time, during which the Dean &s;aw her through a Window,
and no doubt commi&s;erated her de&s;olate Condi|tion. His Footman happened to
come to the Door, and the poor Creature be|&s;ought him in a piteous Tone, to
give that Paper to his Reverence. The Ser|vant read it, and told her with
infinite Scorn, his Ma&s;ter had &s;omething el&s;e to mind than her Petition. 
<Q REND="inline">"What's that you &s;ay, Fellow, &s;aid the Dean,

you have been admoni&s;h'd by me for Drunkenne&s;s, idling, and other Faults,

&s;ollicited a Di&s;charge, was compelled to go to Sea, where he continued five
Years; at the end of which time, finding that Life far different from the
Ea&s;e and Luxury of his former Occupation, he re|turned, and humbly
confe&s;&s;ing, in a Pe|tition to the Dean, his former manifold Crimes; he
a&s;&s;ured him of his &s;incere Reformation, which the Dangers he had

Dean would give him &s;ome Sort of Di&s;charge, &s;ince the Ho|nour of having

call'd for Pen, Ink and Paper, and gave him a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, with which, and

<P>'Tis now, I think, full time for me to take up my Clue, and go on

<P><HI>Wor&s;dale</HI> went abroad, and I took an Opportunity to make
my E&s;cape, to vi&s;it Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and met, according to Cu|&s;tom, a
very kind Reception: For his Friend&s;hip to me was inviolable. He was writing
the <HI>Character and Conduct of</HI> CICERO con&s;ider'd; and did me the
Honour to read it to me: I was infinitely plea&s;ed to find, by the many lively
Sal|lies of Wit in it, that the good Gentle|man's Spirits were undepre&s;s'd
with Years;&mdash;Long may they continue &s;o. This gave me an Opportunity of
writing a Poem to him, which <HI>W&mdash;e</HI> had the Confidence to a&s;k
from me; but I did not chu&s;e to compliment him with it: [The Editor has
applied to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> for a Copy of this Poem, but he having
di&s;po&s;ed of them all, we are obliged to omit it].</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was exceeding well pleas'd when I waited on
him with it, and &s;aid, he would give it a Place, but that it wanted
Correction, which he promi&s;ed to be&s;tow on it: This I readily agreed to, 
<PB N="83" REF="106"> being convinced his Judgment far &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed
mine.</P>
<P>I waited on him next Morning, and found he had greatly improved my

having &s;truck out &s;ome Lines, in which he was mo&s;t prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;aid he, there are two Guineas for your Flattery,

have &s;een a Chariot-wheel do: Our Globe may then become a Comet, and the
Inhabitants of others gaze on it with Surprize and Admiration. I think no

to tell me, that the Boy and he landed the Day before; that my Son was &s;eized
with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever, and wanted to &s;ee me. I went to the
Captain's Lodgings, in <HI>Scotland-Yard,</HI> and found my poor Wan|derer
quite light-headed. The Captain &s;ent a Phy&s;ician and a Surgeon to him, with
Orders to the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e to provide for him whatever was
nece&s;|&s;ary, and he would an&s;wer the Expence For many Days we de&s;pair'd
of his Life, till at length God's Mercy re&s;tor'd him to my Prayers and Tears.
When he came perfectly to him&s;elf he told me, they had been in a violent
Tempe&s;t, where, the Waves rolling Mountains high, he was wet to his Skin, and
the Ship in imminent Danger of being lo&s;t: Captain <HI>Meade,</HI> he &s;aid,
begged of God, that he might ju&s;t &s;ee his Wife and Children, and then he

<P>The Heroine of our Story, being left alone, was &s;o tormented by
his ince&s;tu|ous infernal Fire, that &s;he fled to her younger Brother, who
was an Apothe|cary, and lived at <HI>W&mdash;d&mdash;r.</HI></P>
<P>As he was a Batchelor, he was very glad of her, to over-&s;ee his
dome&s;tick Af|fairs, which, I dare &s;ay, &s;he did very well, as &s;he was a
good Hou&s;ewife, e&s;pecially in the frugal Part of Management: It happened
another Apothecary fell in love with her, but nothing could prevail on her to
accept of him as a Hu&s;band, tho' her Brother tried every Art he could to
per&s;uade her to it.</P>
<P>Things were in this Situation when Captain <HI>Mead</HI> was
commanded on Duty to <HI>W&mdash;d&mdash;r,</HI> and as he had often been
there, was well acquainted with the Town, and as well e&s;teem'd: Mi&s;s
<HI>Wh&mdash;f&mdash;d</HI> and her Brother, with &s;ome young Ladies, were
walking on the Terra&s;s, <PB N="94" REF="117"> when Captain <HI>Meade</HI>
acco&s;ted them. They fell into Chat, and Mr. <HI>Wh&mdash;f&mdash;ld</HI>
invited the Captain to Supper; after which the young Lady retir'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wh&mdash;f&mdash;ld</HI> then acquainted the Captain with
his Si&s;ter's ob&s;tinate Refu&s;al of an advantageous Match. 
<Q REND="inline">"She has,</Q> &s;aid he, 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;eem'd to pay a particular Deference to every
Word you &s;poke to-night, and, I am certain, if you undertake the Lover's
Cau&s;e, you will bring my Si&s;ter to Rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>The Captain &s;aid it would be too abrupt to pretend to advi&s;e a
Lady he had never &s;een before, in &s;o delicate a Point as that of Matrimony,
wherein many Circum&s;tances ought to be con|&s;idered, in order to a Union
firm and la&s;ting. It may be, &s;aid he, the young Lady's Heart is
pre-engaged; in that Ca&s;e, how cruel would it be to force her into a hateful
Wedlock, the Con&s;equence of which is Mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wh&mdash;f&mdash;ld</HI> then a&s;&s;ured him, he had no
&s;uch Intention, all he aimed at was her Happine&s;s: 
<Q REND="inline">"Cultivate, added he, <PB N="95" REF="118"> a
Friend&s;hip with her; you may ea&s;ily do it, and di&s;cover the true Cau&s;e
of her Aver&s;ion toward an hone&s;t good Man, who loves her, and is in
Cir|cum&s;tances to maintain her in Ea&s;e and Plenty."</Q></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Mead</HI> promi&s;ed all in his Power, and when, by
frequenting the Hou&s;e, he had got into a little Intimacy with her, he in a
paternal Stile, when they were alone, expo&s;tulated with her, to no
pur|po&s;e: She &s;aid, &s;he was determined never to marry, as &s;he was
certain &s;he &s;hould never have the Man &s;he only could love.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed very hard to know who it was; a&s;&s;uring her of
his Friend&s;hip; and, at the &s;ame time, laying hold of her Hand, &s;aid, he
mu&s;t be in&s;en&s;ible indeed, who did not, above all other Con&s;idera|tion,
regard &s;o much Tenderne&s;s and Beauty.</P>
<P>He perceiv'd &s;he trembled, blu&s;h'd, and &s;eem'd quite
confounded: 
<Q REND="inline">"Would to God, Madam, &s;aid he, that I was the
happy Occa&s;ion of all tho&s;e tender Emotions which &s;well your fair
Bo|&s;om, <PB N="96" REF="119"> how ble&s;t &s;hould I think my|&s;elf?"</Q>
And are you, &s;aid &s;he, in a fault'ring Voice, are you in earne&s;t, or do
you only trifle with a Weakne&s;s, which your Penetration mu&s;t have
ob&s;erved, even from the fir&s;t Moment I beheld you?</P>
<P>Altho' this Declaration was very plain, yet it was &s;o
unexpected, that the Cap|tain was for &s;ome Moments at a Lo&s;s how to make a
&s;uitable Return: But, recovering him&s;elf, he told her, Joy had made him
&s;peechle&s;s, but from that Hour he was intirely devoted to her for Life.</P>
<P>He then a&s;k'd her in Marriage of her Brother, who ab&s;olutely
refu&s;ed her to him, on account of his being in the Army.</P>
<P>But as the Lady was willing to be the kind Companion of his
Flight, he hired a Chariot and Six, and took her with him.</P>
<P>This Story Captain <HI>Meade</HI> told me before her: Nor did
&s;he in the lea&s;t at|tempt to deny it; but &s;aid, &s;he had 
<PB N="97" REF="120"> gain'd a good Hu&s;band by her Since|rity.</P>
<P>Indeed, while I was with them, they &s;eemed to me perfect
Patterns of conju|gal Love; but her Fondne&s;s &s;eem'd to &s;urpa&s;s all
things, for &s;he would ki&s;s her Husband's Linen, &s;aying, they &s;melt of
Violets and Ro&s;es; but truly, though I lov'd my dear Relation very well, I
was grown &s;o delicate I did not like a <HI>dirty</HI> Shirt (for that was
&s;ometimes the Ca&s;e) to be offered to me as a No&s;egay.</P>
<P>Her Piety was &s;o great, that <HI>Whit&s;unday</HI> Morning, when
we were going to Church, which was near half a Mile from Captain
<HI>Meade</HI>'s Hou&s;e, a young Lady called to us, to know, did the Bell
ring? Mrs. <HI>Meade</HI> an&s;wered, yes, but finding even the Church-yard
Door not open'd, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would not receive the Sacrament that
Morning: I a&s;ked her, why &s;he &s;hould not? Becau&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, I have
told a Lye, in &s;aying the Bell rang: I told her Scruple to Doctor
<HI>Hales</HI>; who join'd us, and pre&s;ently di&s;pelled her 
<PB N="98" REF="121"> Fears, by a&s;&s;uring her, an innocent Mi&s;|take could
never be deemed a Lye.</P>
<P>Upon this we both ventured to receive the ble&s;&s;ed Euchari&s;t,
admini&s;tered to us by a truly holy Hand; for, a&s;&s;uredly, Doctor
<HI>Hales,</HI> yours is &s;uch. And let no Per&s;on &s;ay, I do not reverence
the Clergy, for I really do; but not any one of them, who does not, as near as
Hu|manity can go, aim at the Perfection of their Maker and Redeemer.</P>
<P>As I have already related the Manner of Captain <HI>Meade</HI>'s
Death, let us &s;ee how his pious Widow behav'd her&s;elf on the Occa&s;ion;
after having yell'd and &s;cream'd to &s;ave Appearances, &s;he lock'd up his
Body, and had him next Day buried.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired my Son, who remained di&s;con&s;olate in the
Hou&s;e, to go to the Tower, and bring home whatever of the Captain's was
there; but he being ap|prehen&s;ive that, perhaps, on Account of his Youth, and
his not having a Line with him, they might be refu&s;ed to him, begg'd of me to
accompany him; which, as I was truly de&s;irous of rendering any 
<PB N="99" REF="122"> Service I could to his Family, I readily did. When we
arrived at his Apart|ment there, for the Officers keep one in every Place where
they are obliged to be on Guard, and told the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e my
melancholly Errand, &s;he gave me the Keys of his Bureau, Port|manteau, Trunk,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When I took out his Regimentals, his Sa&s;h, and many other things
appertain|ing to him, in which I had &s;o often &s;een him array'd, I could not
refrain bur&s;ting into Tears, to think the dear Wearer of them was now no
more. Among&s;t other things we found two Guineas, which was a &s;ea&s;onable
Relief to the Widow. The Soldiers on Duty wept like Children at his Death's
&s;ad Story. My Son convey'd all things &s;afe; but the Sight of them did not
take the &s;ame Effect on his Re|lict that they had done on me; for &s;he only
&s;aid, &s;he was very glad to get them.</P>
<P>My Boy, who colours Prints beauti|fully, was employed by Mr.
<HI>Millan,</HI> &s;o that he was innocently and elegantly em|ployed. 
<PB N="100" REF="123"> The Sweets of getting Money made him doubly diligent;
and, to be quite undi&s;turbed, which it was impo&s;&s;i|ble he &s;hould be
with me, &s;o many Per|&s;ons coming for Letters, Petitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
he took a Lodging for him&s;elf. I was one Day exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed when
the Penny-po&s;t brought a Letter, directed to my Son; as it was marked
<HI>Teddington</HI> I open'd it, judging it was &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s that Mrs.
<HI>Meade</HI> wanted to have tran&s;|acted; when, O &s;hameful! it was a
Love-letter to the Child, who was but &s;ixteen Years of Age, and &s;he is four
Years older than I am, with a Direction to him to meet her at a Coffee-hou&s;e
in <HI>London,</HI> and an Offer of Marriage to him.</P>
<P>I really could &s;carce believe the true and credible Avouchment
of my own Eyes. Ble&s;s me! &s;he amaz'd me! yet, thinking this might be a
Counterfeit, I &s;hew'd it to the Boy, and de&s;ired he would go, and &s;ee
into this Matter, nei|ther of us being acquainted with her Hand, which was a
de&s;perate bad one.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="124">He went accordingly, and &s;tay'd mo&s;t
Part of the Evening abroad: When he return'd, he &s;aid he had inquired after
her every-where, and could not learn any Tidings of her; &s;o I conceived this
Let|ter was either wrote by &s;ome Enemy of hers, or el&s;e for Sport, by
&s;ome of the Girls at <HI>Teddington,</HI> in order to &s;end him on a
Wild-goo&s;e Cha&s;e.</P>
<P>About &s;ix Weeks after the Captain's Death an Officer inquired
for me; as I did not know him I a&s;ked, what Com|mands he had for me? He
de&s;ired to know of me, whether I was not a near Relation to Captain
<HI>Meade:</HI> To which, an&s;wering in the Affirmative, I de&s;ired the
Gentleman to &s;it, for he looked as if he had &s;omething of Importance to
de|liver. Pray, Madam, &s;aid he, can you inform me what is become of the
Cap|tain's Widow; my Rea&s;on for inquiring is this; a prior Wife has &s;et up
a Claim to the Pen&s;ion, and produced a Certifi|cate, which we believe to be a
Counter|fit, as it is dated twenty Years ago, and 'tis but rea&s;onable to
think &s;he would, <PB N="102" REF="125"> in that time, have a&s;&s;erted her
ju&s;t Rights. But this is not all, the Officers have made a Collection for the
Lady he acknow|ledg'd, and the Children: But there is a Report &s;pread, that
&s;he is married to a Boy, young enough to be her Son, who was a Helper in the
Captain's Stable. This has damped the Charity of tho&s;e who, had &s;he even
been deceived by the Captain, would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her.</P>
<P>I told him I had often heard the Cap|tain relate that, in his
younger Days, he got in a League with one Mrs. <HI>Meadows,</HI> who, after
having been divorced from her Hu&s;band, &s;et up a Coffee-hou&s;e, where he
boarded and lodg'd: He found her in every Re&s;pect &s;o unfaithful to him,
that he quitted her. Not long after &s;he broke; and, being in Di&s;tre&s;s,
applied to Captain <HI>Meads,</HI> who, in Con&s;ideration of former
Friend&s;hip, agreed to give her annually 20 <HI>l.</HI> provided &s;he
retired; which &s;he agreed to.</P>
<P>I can't, Sir, &s;aid I, help thinking this is &s;ome Piece of her
Contrivance: 'Tis very po&s;&s;ible, Madam, return'd he; and 
<PB N="103" REF="126"> if you will be &s;o kind to inquire into it, that
the&s;e Reports may be confuted, it will be of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence
to|wards the future Welfare of the Widow and Orphans of your decea&s;ed
Relation. I &s;hall pay my Re&s;pects to you again in two or three Days. The
Gentleman left me, and, after a good deal of Search among&s;t Mrs.
<HI>Meade</HI>'s Acquaintance, I learned &s;he lodged in the <HI>Strand.</HI>
There I went, and found her in a very indif|ferent Lodging; the Children were
in deep Mourning, but Madam her&s;elf was deck'd out very gay. After
cu&s;tomary Compliments, I told her I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her out of
Mourning: Why, <HI>Caw|zan,</HI> for that was her manner of Pro|nunciation, I
am married. What, al|ready, return'd I, e'er the Man you &s;eem'd to doat on,
even to Extravagance, is cold in his Grave. Cold, &s;ays &s;he, aye, he's cold
enough, and rotten too, by this time. May be you made him &s;o before Death.
Why &s;hould you think &s;o? Be|cau&s;e you &s;eem to have thrown of com|mon
Decency: And is this all the Re|&s;pect <PB N="104" REF="127"> you pay to &s;o
good a Hu&s;band? In an&s;wer to this, and to my great Surprize, &s;he
a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he never was married to the Captain in her Life.</P>
<P>Here was Hypocri&s;y! (that &s;ly Fiend who '&s;capes all but the
piercing Eye of GOD) in its utmo&s;t Perfection; if one may make u&s;e of
&s;uch an Epithet to &s;uch a devili&s;h Sin. To live in Fornication, yet go to
the Communion without the lea&s;t Purpo&s;e of Amendment of Life, and to
pretend &s;uch &s;trong Affection to a Man, who&s;e very Memory &s;he &s;hewed
&s;he hated; I &s;hall ever after this &s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of &s;uch an
over-acted Fond|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I told her my Errand, and that I was really &s;orry &s;he had put
it out of my Power to vindicate her Conduct; which, cut of Regard to the poor
Children, I would gladly have done. She told me, Doctor <HI>Hales</HI> approved
of her Proceed|ing; and &s;o &s;he did not care what I thought. Though I am
certain this mu&s;t have been fal&s;e, for the Doctor had &s;uch high Notions
of conjugal Fidelity, that <PB N="105" REF="128"> he was true to the
<HI>A&s;hes</HI> of his Spou&s;e, whom he lo&s;t when he was but a very young
Man, and having an agreeable Per&s;on, a &s;weet Temper, and unbounded
Learning, might no Doubt have rai&s;ed his Fortune by a &s;econd Marriage.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other In&s;tances of her Hypo|cri&s;y, this Woman u&s;ed
to pretend, that even &s;mall Beer got into her Head, and would &s;everely
cen&s;ure any Lady who drank a Gla&s;s of Wine; yet now, though it was but nine
o' Clock in the Morning &s;he called for a Dram, drank it off, and would have
had me follow her Example, but I had no Inclination to &s;uch a Break|fa&s;t:
Be&s;ides, having no other E&s;tate but my Head, on which were hourly De|mands,
it was by no other means my Intere&s;t to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>I took my Leave; and, when I re|lated this to my Son, the Boy
laughed exce&s;&s;ively; and, as he then had no man|ner of Re&s;pect for her,
he told me, he had gone to her according to her Ap|pointment; that &s;he had
treated him with two Bottles of Mountain, and pre&s;s'd: <PB N="106" REF="129">
him hard to marry her: Indeed I re|member, when he came home, I &s;aw he had
been drinking, but he &s;aid &s;ome young Gentlemen of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whom
he met, gave him a Bottle of Wine.</P>
<P>However, &s;ome time after, &s;he made him pay for his Liquor, for
&s;he opened a Punch-hou&s;e, which I believe &s;he &s;till keeps, at lea&s;t
&s;he did when I left <HI>Lon|don</HI>; &s;he wrote a Letter to my Son, to
de&s;ire to &s;ee him; accordingly he went; and Madam Temperance carried him
in|to the Dining-room, and ordered her Husband, who &s;erved in Quality of
Waiter, to bring up a Bowl of Arrack-Punch, and half a Dozen Gla&s;&s;es of
Jelly. The Boy was well plea&s;ed with this &s;umptuous Fare; but when the good
Chear was ended, &s;he demanded Pay|ment, and he was obliged to part with his
Week's Earning, which he had ju&s;t received. What could the mo&s;t mer|cenary
Pro&s;titute have done wor&s;e?</P>
<P>But I believe &s;he is &s;ufficiently pu|ni&s;h'd, for I was well
a&s;&s;ured the Groom <PB N="107" REF="130"> took the Liberty of correcting
her, and no-body pitied her.</P>
<P>I think the Philo&s;opher was in the wrong who wi&s;hed for
Windows in the human Brea&s;t; how mi&s;erable mu&s;t we have been, when we
beheld tho&s;e whom we e&s;teem'd Friends, under &s;pecious Ap|pearance,
plotting our De&s;truction; the Object of our Love, even in the mid&s;t of
well-feign'd Rapture, wi&s;hing them|&s;elves in the Arms of another: The Son
who bows his Knee in filial Reverence to his hoary Sire, cur&s;ing the Gout,
Pitargo, and the Rheum, for ending him no &s;ooner. In &s;hort, the Scenes
would be too &s;hocking; they would quite imbite Life.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e philo&s;ophical Gentlemen, who have &s;earched into the
Secrets of Na|ture, have admired the Wi&s;dom of Pro|vidence, in kindly
concealing from us many things, which known, would make us wretched: I am
&s;ure it was well for poor Captain <HI>Meade</HI> this Woman's Brea&s;t was
not tran&s;parent.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="131">They have farther ob&s;erved, that were our

Sickne&s;s, or Di&s;|obedience of Children, the total Lo&s;s of them, and a

<PB N="109" REF="132"> &s;ooner are they &s;ingle, but they run into the &s;ame

In which, I think, the Ladies more excu&s;able than the Men, &s;ince their
Weakne&s;s may make them want a Pro|tector; yet they who can have Re&s;olution
enough to know no &s;econd Bride-bed but the Grave, certainly claim a higher
Degree of Re&s;pect and Veneration.</P>
<P>In this aimable Light &s;hines the pre&s;ent Lady Dowager
<HI>Meade,</HI> who, tho' left a Widow, in the Bloom of her Youth and Beauty,
the Widow of a Gentleman old enough to be her Father, who lo&s;t her &s;ole
Guardian to their Off&s;pring, turn'd all her Thoughts to the Improvement of
her Childrens Minds, and Fortunes, in both of which Heaven crown'd her
Goodne&s;s with Succe&s;s, and the World with Honour.</P>
<P>I could mention another great Lady, not unallied to her, who
though &s;he has many Virtues, as I have acknowledged in my fir&s;t Volume,
being left exactly in the &s;ame Situation, was &s;o faithful a

The Gentle|man had too high a Sen&s;e of filial Piety to commence any Suit in

<P>I can't indeed &s;ay, but Mi&s;s <HI>S&mdash;d&mdash;s</HI>'s

in&s;i&s;ted on her be|ing di&s;mi&s;s'd: Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> ever hu|mane,
received her to his Habitation with open Arms, gave the old Gentle|man free
Ingre&s;s and Egre&s;s, for which he gratefully permitted the Par&s;on to go to
bed to his Daughter; indeed I &s;hould have pitied her, had &s;he been deceived
by the Report of my Death, &s;o indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly &s;pread, into Marriage; but
&s;he had it under my own Hand, that I was living, for I did the Creature the
Honour, S&mdash;t as &s;he is, to write to her, in order to prevent her being
impo&s;ed on. I think the Form of Matrimony really wants an Explanation, if we
go according to the &s;trict Letter of the Law. What a happy State mu&s;t a
young Woman imagine her|&s;elf entering into, where &s;he is to be lov'd,
honour'd, cheri&s;h'd, nay, even wor&s;hipped; &s;he has a Protector till the
Hour of Death, who is to for&s;ake all, even his Parents, for her, if it be
re|quired, who endows her with his For|tune, and promi&s;es all this &s;olemnly
at the Altar.</P>

<P>No &s;ooner is the Honey-moon expir'd but the fawning Servant
turns a haughty Lord: In&s;tead of honouring his Wife, 'tis Odds if he treats
her with common Civility; he &s;hall tell her, to her Face, he wi&s;hes her
Death, in order to marry another. The Cu&s;tom authorizes this free way of
&s;peaking; yet I never knew it agreeable to any Wife, nor did I ever doubt but
the Hu&s;band &s;poke in the Sin|cerity of his Heart.</P>
<P>As for our being endow'd with the worldly Goods of our Husbands,
'tis known they are &s;o little apt to &s;hare with us, that it has always been
found nece&s;&s;ary, in a Marriage-Settlement, to &s;tipulate for Pin-money, a
very u&s;eful Clau&s;e even to the Husband, and it is much better his Wife
&s;hould have a Share of his Fortune, than be obliged to a

in too tender a manner.</P>
<P>Indeed the la&s;t Article again&s;t Divorce|ment, I intirely
di&s;approve of; and am glad it has &s;eem'd good to the Wi&s;dom of the Church
to act in direct Contra|diction to it: This has made Numbers ea&s;y, and, as
they tell us, 'tis not lawful to &s;eparate on any Cau&s;e, &s;ave that of
Adultery. A Woman of Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">it, who is
married to a &s;ordid di&s;agreeable Wretch, has nothing to do but to make him
a Cuckold; and then welcome thrice dear Liberty: Yet methinks the Husbands
&s;hould, in Ju&s;tice, return to their Wives, when they abandon them, the
Dowry they brought with them: Now, le&s;t my worthy Husband &s;hould &s;ay by
this Rule, I &s;hould have nothing, who had not a Portion regularly paid, and
yet was a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">petual Fortune to him,
I'll tell him a Story.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Eglantine,</HI> one of the greate&s;t
Beauties in <HI>Scotland,</HI> fell under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of her Lord, for
no other <PB N="117" REF="140"> Cau&s;e but having brought him &s;even
Daughters, all charming as this fair Northern La&s;s, and never a Son: On this
his Lord&s;hip a&s;&s;ured her, he was deter|mined to &s;ue for a Divorce. The
Lady told him, &s;he would readily agree to a Separation, provided he gave her
back what he had with her. He, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he meant pecuniary Affairs,
a&s;&s;ured her &s;he &s;hould have her Fortune to the la&s;t Penny. Nay, nay,
my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, 
<Q REND="inline">"that winna do; return me my Youth, Beauty, and
Virginity, and di&s;mi&s;s me as &s;oon as you plea&s;e:"</Q> His Lord|&s;hip
being unable to an&s;wer this Demand, &s;poke no more of parting with his Lady,
and, e'er the Year expired, &s;he made him the glad Father of a lovely Boy,
who&s;e Birth re&s;tored Love and Harmony to his noble Parents. This was
related to me by the late Lord <HI>Primro&s;e</HI>; and therefore I believe
it.</P>
<P>But now, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> tho' I pre|&s;ented you with this

no profane thing, Prie&s;t, Dog, nor Worm, dare en|ter, I am re&s;olved to
remain obdurate: Sooner &s;hall Lambs make Love to Lambs, Tygers to Tygers, and

<P>Yet verily thou do&s;t manife&s;t &s;ome Tokens of Grace,

the Emperor, who de&s;ired to &s;ee this matchle&s;s Son of Science; over|joyed
he came, &s;hewed his Trick to the infinite Plea&s;ure of the Spectators; the
Emperor highly applauded him, and as he &s;uppo&s;ed this mu&s;t be a Work of

Years he had &s;pent in attaining it; the Fellow being willing to inhance his
own Merit, a&s;&s;ured the Monarch he had &s;pent thirty Years in it; on which
the Emperor ordered him thirty Ba&s;tinadoes on the Soals of his Feet, for
having &s;o much mi&s;&s;pent his Time.</P>
<P>And, my dear Hu&s;band, if you have your De&s;ert, you merit

<PB N="121" REF="144"> Writing one good Sermon, or u&s;eful Book, both of which

not only pitied, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted me; and while I can in that noble Li&s;t

always in this Ca&s;e judge there is more Fear than Charity in their
Contributions. But here I mu&s;t remember a certain cro&s;s Dean, to whom, as
my Father was Phy&s;ician, I took the Liberty of applying. My Son went with the
Letter; he came out, and cried, "Boy, opening his ponderous and toothle&s;s
Jaws, what do you want? An An&s;wer, Sir, &s;aid he; why, then my An&s;wer is,
I won't. My Son prote&s;ted he was quite &s;tartled at his ferocious Features
and &s;tentorian Voice. Yet, after all, we laugh'd away our In|dignation, as he
was really not worth it.</P>
<P>This admirable Orator ought to have a larger Ro&s;trum than the

be admired Grimace. A Theatre would &s;uit his Genius; a Puppet one I mean,
where glorious Punch him&s;elf mu&s;t yield the Prize.</P>
<P>I remember once to have &s;een this Re|verend Flamen, in his
lengthened Dre&s;s, a&s;cend St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Pulpit; where, re|collecting
<PB N="123" REF="146"> the enormous Iniquities of the Congregation, he of
&s;udden gave &s;o fu|rious a To&s;s to his Head, like a metal|&s;ome Hor&s;e
hard rein'd, that back fell his Wig and down flew his Sermon; which not being
well &s;ecured, fluttered in nume|rous Leaves about the Church, &s;cattered
like the Ungodly, as Chaff before the Wind; the Sleepers awoke, the old Men who
dream'd Dreams, and the Virgins who &s;aw Vi&s;ions, &s;tarted from their
dow|ny Trance; and he, willing at lea&s;t, to give us his Benediction, cried
aloud, 
<Q REND="inline">"Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire, which
that ye may all do, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The late Lady <HI>Rawden,</HI> not long after &s;he became a
Widow, invited the Dean as her Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter, to Dinner; the Lady went to
take the Air, and Sir <HI>John,</HI> then a Child, was in the Parlour; the Dean
fell into Chat with the &s;weet Boy, and among&s;t other Que&s;tions &s;aid, do
you know me? No, Sir; why I am Dean C&mdash;, your Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter. Poor
Ma&s;ter innocently verified the old Pro|verb, <PB N="124" REF="147"> that
Children &s;peak Truth, for he cried out, O indeed, I heard my Mam|ma &s;ay,
you were the wor&s;t Preacher in <HI>Dublin:</HI> His Reverence's Wrath was

him, corrected the poor Child: However, &s;he could not avoid relating the
Story; which I heard from Lady <HI>Rawden,</HI> at Mrs. <HI>Percival</HI>'s, to
the infinite Laughter of the Auditors, and which I from henceforth con&s;ign to
Fame in the&s;e my immortal Labours.</P>
<P>I was much obliged to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Hu|manity in
<HI>London,</HI> which I gratefully ac|knowledge. But there is one great Man I
cannot pa&s;s over; great, according to Serjeant <HI>Kite</HI>'s Definition of
one, for he is full &s;ix Foot high; his Fortune rais'd from the noble Spirit
of Malt; for I do remember, like Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> that poor Creature's
Small-Beer, which his Father &s;old to mine; and from the golden Grains aro&s;e
a princely Fortune; from the humbly Dray appeared a Coach, &s;uch as

farther than ly|ing a little for the Good of their King and Country.</P>
<P>It was this worthy Gentleman who told them at <HI>White</HI>'s
that I had nothing to publi&s;h: I had quick Intelligence of his Favour; after
which Obligation he came to vi&s;it me, and would have been very kind to me
becau&s;e I was a Gentlewo|man, a Per&s;on he could depend on; and he was then
in Di&s;tre&s;s, being at a Di&s;tance from his Lady and native Coun|try; to be
&s;ure I ought to have been cha|ritable, but that I always &s;tood in the Way

<P>Your hoary canting Sire was a Votary to <HI>Venus,</HI> even in

not care to have it known, he went in thro' a low Window to Mi&s;s's
Bedchamber: It happened that Mi&s;s being abroad, the venerable Pair made
Choice of that Place, to indulge the gentler Pa&s;&s;ions: The young Gentle|man
came according to Cu&s;tom, and without Ceremony threw up the Sa&s;h, flew in,
and unfortunately &s;tarted from their downy Couch the reverend Elder and the

<P><HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI>'s Religion of Nature deli|neated, tho'

Truth.</P>
<P>A Captain of a Man of War took a Fancy to de&s;pi&s;e his Wife,
and engage with another Woman: The Wife took it patiently, till at la&s;t he
had the Impu|dence to tell her, he would either bring his Harlot to live with
her, or &s;he and his three Children &s;hould turn out: The Lady was confounded
at &s;o &s;trange a Propo&s;al, and begg'd three Days time to con&s;ider of it;
and then &s;he would give him a determinate An&s;wer: He agreed: She told her
Affliction to a Friend, and begg'd her Advice; on which they re&s;olved to
con&s;ult Doctor <HI>Potter,</HI> late Lord Archbi&s;hop of
<HI>Canter|bury:</HI> Accordingly they took a Boat, and went to
<HI>Lambeth</HI>: The good Prelate propo&s;ed an Invocation to the Almighty 
<PB N="140" REF="163"> to direct their Coun&s;els: After Prayers he de&s;ired
the Lady not, by any means, to quit her Hou&s;e, but to acquie&s;ce in her
Husband's De&s;ire, and let him bring the Woman home; and, depend on it, &s;aid
he, God will a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and what at pre&s;ent appears an Evil, will turn
out a Ble&s;&s;ing to you: So, giving them his Be|nediction, they departed full
of Hope of an happy I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The Husband, who flatter'd him&s;elf that the Wife would quit the
Hou&s;e, was not a little a&s;toni&s;h'd to find her quite &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to
his Commands, and con&s;ent|ing to live with his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Accordingly he ordered his Chariot, bade his Wife prepare Dinner,
and went for his Harlot, whom he brought home triumphant, and handed into the
Dining-room; the Wife received her with a Ci|vility that confounded and enraged
her; &s;he brought her a Gla&s;s of <HI>Lisbon</HI> Wine, and then left her
with the Captain, who, in a few Minutes came down, and &s;eeing all things
ready for Dinner, ordered his Wife to go and bring the Lady down: 
<PB N="141" REF="164"> She obey'd, but Madam called her a hundred Names, flew
at the Captain, beat him, and put her&s;elf in &s;uch a Rage, that &s;he fell
into Fits, was &s;eiz'd with a Fever, and died.</P>
<P>After this Cata&s;trophe, the Captain &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on
the Submi&s;&s;ion and Virtue of his Wife, thus addre&s;s'd her: My Dear, if I
thought there was a Po&s;&s;ibility of your pardoning my pa&s;t Errors, and
never reproaching me with them, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I wou'd never fall in|to
them again, but make a faithful tender Hu&s;band to you. The Lady bur&s;t into
joyful Tears at this happy Change, and kindly a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he would
never even think of what was pa&s;t: She told him it was by the Archbi&s;hop's
Advice &s;he had acted with the Moderation &s;he now found to be &s;o happy in
the Event; and they both went to thank the venerable Prelate, who truly partook
in their Joy. The Captain died about a Year after, and left his whole Fortune
to his Lady, who lives an honourable Widow at <HI>Green|wich.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="165">Thus we may &s;ee, if we per&s;evere in our
Duty, the Almighty is not &s;low to hear, nor reward;

<P>I was told a pretty Circum&s;tance of his Grace, when he was at
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> School: It &s;eems he &s;tood terribly in awe of the
Rod, and having committed &s;ome Mi&s;take that de&s;erved Cha&s;ti&s;ement,
which Doctor <HI>Busby</HI> was very liberal in be&s;towing, he was ready to
die with the Apprehen&s;ion of it; when a good bold-&s;pirited Lad, taking
Compa&s;&s;ion on him, own'd the Fault, and took the Whip|ing; for which his
timid Friend pro|mi&s;ed to be grateful, if ever it came in his way to &s;erve
him: They both took holy Orders, but met not till many Years after, when his
Grace was an Archbi&s;hop, his Friend remained a Curate; but Time, which brings
all things about, &s;o order'd it, that the Archbi&s;hop and the Curate 
<PB N="143" REF="166"> met at a Nobleman's Hou&s;e: His Grace, hearing him
named, recollected both the Gentleman, the Whipping, and his own Promi&s;e of
Gratitude; and finding the Curate had no Preferment, he gave him a very good
Living.</P>
<P>I hope the&s;e Incidents will not be di&s;|agreeable to my
Readers, as I really &s;et down nothing but what I know to be Truth, which is
more than mo&s;t of our modern Memoriali&s;ts can &s;ay, who pre&s;ent us with
Heaps of Improbabilities, and ex|pect implicit Faith from us; and if what
&s;ome of them have told us be genuine, though it may redound to their Profit,
it never can to their Honour; for their Actions are neither worthy being
record|ed, nor their Writings of being read; the true End of Writing being to
give In|&s;truction with Plea&s;ure, which, whoever is &s;o happy to do, may
ju&s;tly hope for a Place in the Temple of Fame: But

<P>And having once more quoted our un|rivalled Dean, and being well
a&s;&s;ured no Part of my Work can be half &s;o agree|able or entertaining to
the Publick, as that which relates to him, I &s;hall, as far as in my Power,
pre&s;ent them with his lively Portraiture. The mo&s;t minute Circum&s;tances
relating to &s;o great a Man cannot, I hope, be deem'd trivial; &s;ince we find
by Experience, that the Night-Scene, &s;o beautifully drawn by
<HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> between <HI>Brutus</HI> and his Dome&s;ticks, &s;leeping
in his Tent, the little Incident of his taking the Lute out of the Boy's Hand,
and &s;aying, when he fell a&s;leep, 
<Q> 
<L>This is a &s;leepy Tune:&mdash;O murtherous Sleep,</L>

<L>I'll take it from thee, and, good Boy, good Night.</L></Q></P>
<P>Do we not love him more in this ami|able View of him, than in all
his Con|que&s;ts; or that &s;ad Act whereby he thought to give his Country
Liberty? The World are &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Dean's publick
Character, be it then my Ta&s;k to trace him in private Life; for there only it
is we can frame a true Judgment of any Per&s;on, the re&s;t is frequently mere
Out&s;ide.</P>
<P>When the Dean was at <HI>Bellcamp,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of the
Reverend Doctor <HI>Grat|ton,</HI> he wrote to Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI> to come
and dine with him, mighty <HI>Thomas Thumb,</HI> and her &s;erene Highne&s;s of
<HI>Lilly|put,</HI> meaning my Husband and me: Ac|cordingly we went; the Dean
came out <PB N="146" REF="169"> to meet us, and I, by Agreement, hiding my
Face, Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> told him they had picked up a Girl on the Road,
and de&s;ired to know whether they might bring her in? He, gue&s;&s;ing who it
was, &s;aid, let her &s;hew her Face, and if &s;he be likely, we'll admit her.
On this I took down my Fan, and &s;aid, O, in|deed, Sir, I am: Well then,
&s;aid he, give me your Hand. He led me into a Parlour, where there were twelve
Clergy men, and &s;aid, tho&s;e Fellows coming in had brought a Wench with
them; but, added he, we'll give her a Dinner, poor Devil! and keep the Secret
of our Bre|thren:&mdash;As mo&s;t of the Gentlemen knew me, we were very merry
on this odd Introduction.</P>
<P>Pox on you, you Slut, &s;aid the Dean, you gave me a Hint for my
polite Con|ver&s;ation, which I have pur&s;ued: You &s;aid, it would be better
to throw it into Dialogue; and &s;uppo&s;e it to pa&s;s among&s;t the Great; I
have improved by you: O dear Sir, &s;aid I, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould do
otherwi&s;e. Matchle&s;s Saucine&s;s! re|turn'd <PB N="147" REF="170"> he:
Well, but I'll read you the Work; which he did with infinite Hu|mour, to our
high Entertainment.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> time, and froze very hard: The Dean,
meditating Revenge, &s;et the Wine before a great Fire, the Corks of the Wine
being &s;ecured with Pitch and Ro&s;in; which began, in a little while, to
melt: No &s;ooner did the Dean perceive they were fit for his Purpo&s;e, but he
&s;lyly rubbed his Fingers on them, and daubed my Face all over. In&s;tead of
being vexed, as he expected I would, I told him he did me great Honour in
&s;ealing me for his own. Plague on her, &s;aid he, I can't put her out of
Temper; yet he &s;eemed determined to do it, if po&s;&s;ible, for he a&s;ked
the Company, if they had ever &s;een &s;uch a Dwarf? and in&s;i&s;ted, that I
&s;hould pull off my Shoes till he mea&s;ured me: To this I had no Inclination
to &s;ubmit, but he was an ab|&s;olute Prince, and Re&s;i&s;tance would have
little availed me; &s;o when I obey'd, he &s;aid, Why, I &s;u&s;pected you had
either <PB N="148" REF="171"> broken Stockings, or foul Toes, and in either
Ca&s;e &s;hould have delighted to have expo&s;ed you.</P>
<P>He then made me &s;tand up again&s;t the Wain&s;cot, leaned his
Hand as heavy as he could upon my Head, till I &s;hrunk under the Weight, to
almo&s;t half my Proportion; then making a Mark with his Pencil, he affirmed, I
was but three Foot two Inches high.</P>
<P>Dinner was brought up, and I being, like Mrs. <HI>Qualm&s;ick</HI>
the Curate's Wife, always a breeding, could not eat any; the Gentlemen
gue&s;&s;ing at my Circum|&s;tances, by my decrea&s;ing Face, and in|crea&s;ing
Wa&s;te, were &s;o over-obliging to know what I liked be&s;t; that at la&s;t I
told the Dean, I wi&s;h'd I was a Man, that I might be treated with le&s;s
Cere|mony: Why, &s;aid the Dean, it may be you are: I wi&s;h, Sir, &s;aid I,
you would put the Que&s;tion to the Company, and accordingly to their Votes,
let my Sex be determined. I will, &s;aid he; <HI>Fil|kington,</HI> what &s;ay
you? A Man, Sir: they all took his Word; and, in Spite <PB N="149" REF="172">
of Petticoats, I was made a Man of af|ter Dinner: I was obliged to put a
To|bacco-pipe in my Mouth; but they &s;o far indulged me, as to let it be an
empty one; as were the Dean's, Doctor <HI>Delany</HI>'s, and my Husband's.</P>
<P>The Dean a&s;ked me, could I play Crib|bidge? I &s;aid, I could:
Upon which he called for Cards; but, upon Recollection, &s;aid, he would not
play with a Beggar, for he &s;hould &s;tand no Chance; for if he won, he would
not take the Money, and if he lo&s;t, he mu&s;t in Honour pay. But why a
Beggar, Mr. Dean, &s;aid Doctor <HI>Delany?</HI> A married Curate mu&s;t of
Con|&s;equence be a Beggar, return'd he, and you are another; and Pox on me, if
I can ever get acquainted with any Per&s;ons but Beggars; and I don't think but
this Woman, or Man here, is in the way of producing another. Then, Sir, I hope
you will be &s;o kind to &s;tand Godfather, which will &s;ecure it from &s;o
hard a Fate. So! &s;aid he, more Demands upon me! Well, if it be a Boy, I don't
much care <PB N="150" REF="173"> if I do; but if it be a little Bitch I'll
never an&s;wer for her.</P>
<P>A Day or two after this the Dean came to Town, and &s;ummoning a
<HI>Sena|tus Con&s;ultum,</HI> as he called tho&s;e few Friends whom he
peculiarly regarded; he placed us round a great Table, where he told us, we
were an empannell'd Jury; and he placed him&s;elf at the Head of it, where he
&s;at as Judge. He then told us, the Rea&s;on why we were &s;ummoned, Mr.
<HI>Gratton</HI>'s favourite Hen was put to Death by an unlucky Stroke of a
Whip, by one of my Fellows, as I &s;uppo&s;e: I accu&s;ed them, and they denied
the Fact; but as Murder always will come to light, I found the Hen's Head and
Neck in the Seat of my Chai&s;e-box; and now I want to convict the Criminal:
Accordingly he ordered his three Men Servants to come before us, and related
the following Story to them: When Doctor <HI>Donne,</HI> after|wards Dean of
<HI>St. Paul's, London,</HI> took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t Living he
ever had, being a &s;peculative Man, he took a Walk into the Church-yard, where
the Sexton <PB N="151" REF="174"> was digging a Grave, and throwing up a Skull,
the Doctor took it up, to con|template thereon; and found a &s;mall Sprig, or
headle&s;s Nail &s;ticking in the Temple, which he drew out &s;ecretly, and
wrapt it up in the Corner of his Hand|kerchief; he then demanded of the
Grave|digger, whether he knew who&s;e Skull that was? He &s;aid he did, very
well; declar|ing it was a Man's who kept a Brandy-&s;hop, an hone&s;t drunken
Fellow, who one Night taking two Quarts of that comfortable Creature, was found
dead in his Bed the next Morning: Had he a Wife, &s;aid the Doctor? Yes, Sir:
Is &s;he living? Yes: What Character does &s;he bear? a very good one; only
indeed the Neighbours reflected on her, becau&s;e &s;he married the Day after
her Husband was buried; though, to be &s;ure, &s;he had no great Rea&s;on to
grieve after him. This was enough for the Doctor, who under Pretence of
vi&s;iting all his Pari&s;hioners, called on her; he a&s;ked her &s;everal
Que|&s;tions, and among&s;t others, What Sick|ne&s;s her fir&s;t Husband died
of? She giv|ing <PB N="152" REF="175"> him the &s;ame Account he had be|fore
received, he &s;uddenly opened the Handkerchief, and cried, in an
authori|tative Voice, <HI>Woman, do you know this Nail?</HI> She was &s;truck
with Horror at the unexpected Demand, and in&s;tantly owned the Fact: And &s;o,
Fellow, &s;aid Dean <HI>Swift,</HI> do you know this Head? The Criminal
confe&s;&s;ed his Fault, and the Jury brought him in guilty of Hen|&s;laughter,
in his own Defence, for he declared he was hungry, and did eat it, having no
Malice prepen&s;e to it, but ra|ther Love. On Account of his Sincerity, and our
Interce&s;&s;ion, the Dean pardon'd him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gratton</HI> had pre&s;ented the Dean with a &s;mall
Ca&s;k of fine Ale, of which he was very choice; good Malt-Liquor not being
ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed even in <HI>Ire|land.</HI> On <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening the
Dean's Set of Intimates came as u&s;ual, to pa&s;s it with him, and he being in
high good Humour, &s;aid, he would treat us with a Pot of this Ale. I had the
Honour of being intru&s;ted with the Key of the Cel|lar, <PB N="153" REF="176">
with a particular Order to hold the Candle in &s;uch a Po&s;ition, that it
might drop into the Tankard; as al&s;o not to put the Spiggot fa&s;t in, but
let the Drink run about. After receiving his Com|mands, which I promi&s;ed
punctually to obey, I went down, but had &s;carce open'd the Door, when Doctor
<HI>Delany</HI> and Doc|tor <HI>Sheridan</HI> were with me. O Breach of
Tru&s;t, unpardonable! We &s;at down on a Bench, and each of us drank; but we
laughed &s;o heartily at cheating the Dean, that he &s;tole down, having &s;ome
Su&s;picion, that where there was a Wo|man, and two Clergymen, there might be a
Plot, and &s;urpri&s;ed us: I, in Imita|tion of his Servant, told him, the
Par|&s;ons &s;educed me, and I did drink: Pox choke you all, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>In vain did I, with all the moving Eloquence of a female Orator,
plead for Pardon: The Key was taken from me, and Mr. <HI>Rochford</HI> was,
before my Face, inve&s;ted with my Honours; and I, Oh fatal Sentence! condemn'd
to be Sock-wa&s;her <PB N="154" REF="177"> to the blackguard Boy, who wait|ed
on the under Butler's under Butler.</P>
<P>I would have per&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Rochford</HI> to plead in my
Behalf, but he was obdu|rate as Adamant; e&s;pecially as by my Di&s;grace he
ro&s;e. However, not long after, I pre&s;ented him with an humble Petition,
wherein I failed not to extol the Neatne&s;s of the Boy's Feet, &s;ince they
came into my Hands, in&s;omuch 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;that not the nice&s;t No&s;e</L> 
<L>Cou'd, in the Dog-days, &s;mell his Toes.</L></Q></P>
<P>And, as a Reward, I was made In|&s;pectore&s;s-general of all the
drinking Ve&s;|&s;els; but no more intru&s;ted with the Key of the Cellar: To
&s;ay the Truth, I could not well vindicate my Conduct in that im|portant
Point.</P>
<P>The Dean had twenty of tho&s;e agree|able Whims, which kept us all
chearful, as was his Intent; for I &s;uppo&s;e my Readers will believe, that
neither he nor we valued the Ale, but for the Je&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="178">No Man living told a Story to more Advantage
than the Dean; there never was a Word too little or too much in it, it was
always apt, full, clear, and conci&s;e, truly epigrammatick.</P>
<P>It would be well for their Readers, if &s;ome of our Writers had
learn'd this happy Art; but they draw out their Tales to a tire&s;ome Length,
dwelling on every trivial Circum&s;tance, and omitting things of greater
Con&s;equence, and when they would &s;eem wi&s;e, they grow ob&s;cure.

<P>The Dean told me, he did remember that he had not laugh'd above
twice in his Life; once at &s;ome Trick a Moun|tebank's Merry-Andrew play'd;
and the other time was at the Circum&s;tance of <HI>Tom Thumb</HI>'s killing
the Gho&s;t; and, I can a&s;&s;ure Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> the Dean had a high
Opinion of his Wit, which mu&s;t <PB N="156" REF="179"> be a Plea&s;ure to him,
as no Man was ever better qualified to judge, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it &s;o
eminently him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet was he &s;o free from any vain O&s;|&s;tentation of it, that
he could &s;uit his Conver&s;e to the Talents of his Company; in&s;omuch that,
I believe, had they pro|po&s;ed to play Pu&s;h-pin, or talk Non|&s;en&s;e, he
would have complied even with the latter, if it had been in his Power.</P>

<P>One Night, that I had the Honour to be in as polite a Set of
Company as ever <HI>Europe</HI> bred, they took a Fancy that each of them would
imitate the Voice of a different Animal, either Bird or Bea&s;t, each having
fixed on what &s;uited their Inclination; they began the Con|&s;ort at once:
Would not any one, who had refu&s;ed to join in the Frolick, have &s;eem'd
ridiculous? 'Tis true, indeed, this was attended with one mortifying
Con|&s;equence; for the Servants, &s;car'd at the hideous Yelling, and
concluding we were all fighting, ran ha&s;tily in to part us; but finding all
was right, they left us; however, we heard them laugh heartily at our
Entertainment.</P>
<P>As I have often mentioned the Dean's Charity, one ill conferr'd
In&s;tance of it cannot, I believe, but make my Readers &s;mile:</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="181">He ob&s;erved a Woman, who&s;e whole
E&s;tate was a Sieve of Fruit, which &s;he had in a Stall, where &s;he &s;at
footing worn-out Stockings. Seeing the Woman very decent, and always at work,
he judged her to be a proper Per&s;on for him to a&s;&s;i&s;t; e&s;pecially as,
by the Re|port of her Neighbours, &s;he was a very hone&s;t Woman. The Dean
a&s;ked her, why &s;he did not try to borrow twenty Pounds, and &s;et up a
hand&s;ome Fruit|&s;hop. Alas-a-day, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, who would tru&s;t a
poor Creature like me with &s;uch a Sum? Why, &s;aid he, if I thought you would
improve it, I would lend it you. The Woman promi&s;ed fair, and the Dean lent
her the Money; and, at the &s;ame time, wrote down the parti|cular kinds of
Fruit he would have her furni&s;h her&s;elf with. She was to let him know when
&s;he was &s;tock'd, and he pro|mi&s;ed to recommend her to Cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>The Woman, overjoy'd at her good Fortune, went about five o'Clock
next Morning to a Gardener's, produced her Bill of Fare, on which they, judging
by her <PB N="159" REF="182"> Appearance &s;he could not pay for &s;uch a
Cargo, laugh'd at her. This provok'd the Pride of the new-rais'd Beggar; who,
to convince them of her Wealth, produced it to their a&s;toni&s;h'd View; upon
which they alter'd their Note, and as it was a cold Morning, &s;aid, That 
<Q REND="inline">"Bargains were never made with dry Lips."</Q> They
drew in the poor Woman to drink plen|tifully of 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandy and Ale mixt.</NOTE>Hotpot, which
&s;oon left her &s;tupid in the Ale-hou&s;e; but not till they had fir&s;t done
her the Favour to rob her.</P>
<P>When &s;he came a little to her&s;elf, the Woman of the Hou&s;e
demanded Pay|ment; the Fellows being gone. She was going to pay the Reckoning,
but alas! her Money was gone too: It was in vain for her to enquire for it,
every-body di&s;avowed the Fact; but the Gardener, out of his great Charity,
gave her a Ba&s;ket of Windfalls, with which &s;he was obliged, &s;eeing no
Remedy, to return to her origi|nal Poverty.</P>
<P>The Dean vainly look'd for the Pro|duct of his Charity; he could
neither <PB N="160" REF="183"> &s;ee Shop, nor Woman, for &s;he kept out of his
way; at length he happened in Church to be &s;eiz'd with the Cholick, and went
out in the middle of Service; and who &s;tood at the Church-door, but the very
Per&s;on? He &s;topp'd, and de|manded, why he had not heard from her, and how
&s;he proceeded? Upon this the Woman flew into a Rage, abu&s;ed him all the Way
to his own Hou&s;e, told him, that his cur&s;ed Money had bewitch'd her; that
all the Neighbours knew &s;he was a mode&s;t, virtuous, &s;ober Woman, and that
he had made her turn Whore and Drunkard; the Dean ran in, clap'd the the Door
upon her, and begged the Protection of his Dome&s;ticks again&s;t the mad
Woman.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that as the Dean was very ju&s;tly
&s;atirical on the Vices of human Kind, yet when he fell on Infirmities, he
&s;eem'd to have done a di&s;plea&s;ing Act to Heaven, ina&s;much as he was
puni&s;hed with them all in a re|markable manner; he lived to be a 
<PB N="161" REF="184"> <HI>Struldbrugg,</HI> helple&s;s as a Child, and un|able
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not this as any Reflection to his &s;acred Memory, Heaven
forbid I &s;hould; but with all the Reverence I have for the Dean, I really
think he &s;ometimes cho&s;e Subjects unworthy of his Mu&s;e, and which could
&s;erve for no other End ex|cept that of turning the Reader's Sto|mach, as it
did my Mother's, who, upon reading the <HI>Lady's Dre&s;&s;ing-room,</HI>
in|&s;tantly threw up her Dinner.</P>
<P>Here I digre&s;s, oddly enough, on a whim&s;ical Circum&s;tance.
Having once had the Honour of being known to Lady ******, I took the Liberty of
applying to her for a Sub&s;cription; her Neice came out, and mi&s;taking the
Per|&s;on who brought the Letter for me, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Her Lady wondered at my Impu|dence, to apply to
her, when I knew how I had u&s;ed Sir ******:"</Q> But if ever I u&s;ed him, or
he me, then am I no two-legged Creature; for, to my Knowledge, I never even
&s;aw him; if the Man did dare to contradict me, I <PB N="162" REF="185"> wou'd
make him eat a Piece of my Pen: But how u&s;ed him? not unlawfully, I hope. Did
your Lady&s;hip ever &s;ee me lewdly lolling on a Love-bed with him? No, if we
ever met, he was &s;upported by two reverend Prelates, proper Sup|porters for a
Chri&s;tian Hero; but I never heard that the Gentleman was addicted to Women;
&s;o that I hope I may re&s;t un|cen&s;ured by him, and al&s;o by your
L&mdash;p.</P>
<P>I do this, Madam, in regard to the Gentleman's Character, for my
own is of no Con&s;equence. 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis Bare-bit, and knawn by Trea&s;on's Canker-Tooth.</L>

<P>And pray now, Sir <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> for to thee I call, but with

<P>The Hour now came, when the Dean's Promi&s;e was to be claim'd; as
I brought forth a Son, I wrote to him, but he was in the Country, and in five
Days the Boy died: The Dean did not return till I was a Fortnight brought to
Bed.</P>
<P>He came directly to vi&s;it me: Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> open'd the
Door for him, and brought him up to me. After wi&s;hing me Joy, he a&s;ked,
where was his God|&s;on-elect? I told him in Heaven: The Lord be prai&s;ed,
&s;aid he, I thought there was &s;ome good News in the way, your Husband look'd
&s;o bri&s;k: Pox take me, but I was in Hopes you were dead your|&s;elf; but
'tis pretty well as it is, I have <PB N="166" REF="189"> &s;av'd by it, and I
&s;hould have got no|thing by you.</P>
<P>He drank a little Caudle with me, and then went away; about an
Hour after his Servant brought me a Letter, and a great Bundle of brown Paper,
&s;ealed with the utmo&s;t Care, and twi&s;ted round with I know not how many
Yards of Pack-thread; my Curio&s;ity led me to read the Letter before I
examined the Contents of the Paper, which, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge, was
this: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you a Piece of Plumb-cake, which I did intend &s;hould
be &s;pent at your Chri&s;tening; if you have any Objection to the Plumbs, or

<P>I now examined the Contents of the Paper, in which I found a Piece
of Gin|ger-bread, in which were &s;tuck four <PB N="167" REF="190"> Guineas,
wrapt in white Paper, on the Out&s;ide of each was wrote Plumb.</P>
<P>I &s;ent the Dean a real Piece of Pumb cake, with this An&s;wer: 
<LETTER>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have heard that O&s;tridges could dige&s;t Iron, but you

</LETTER></P>
<P>Ju&s;t when he had fix'd Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to be Chaplain to
Alderman <HI>Barber,</HI> the Dean received from <HI>Spain,</HI> from one Mr.
<HI>Wogan,</HI> a green Velvet Bag, in which was contained the Adventures of
<HI>Euge|nius</HI>; as al&s;o an Account of the Court|&s;hip and Marriage of
the Chevalier, to the Prince&s;s <HI>Sobie&s;ky,</HI> wherein he repre|&s;ents 
<PB N="168" REF="191"> him&s;elf to have been a principal Ne|gotiator. It was
wrote in the Novel Stile, but a little heavily: There was al&s;o &s;ome of the
P&s;alms of <HI>David,</HI> paraphras'd in <HI>Miltonick</HI> Ver&s;e, and a
Letter to the Dean, with Remarks on the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI>; in which he
&s;ays he believes the People of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> had
quite lo&s;t all Remains of Elegance and Ta&s;te, &s;ince their top
Entertainments were com|po&s;ed of Scenes of Highwaymen, and Pro&s;titutes, who
all remain unpuni&s;h'd and triumphant in their Crimes: He concluded with
paying the Dean the Compliment of intreating him to correct the Work.</P>
<P>The Dean &s;aid, he did not care to be troubled with it, and bid
Mr. <HI>Pilking|ton</HI> take it to <HI>London,</HI> and look it over at his
Lei&s;ure, which accordingly he did.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce gone, when the Dean came to me for the Bag; I told
him my Hu&s;band had; according to his Com|mands, taken it with him. He
prote&s;ted he never gave him any &s;uch Permi&s;&s;ion; <PB N="169" REF="192">
that I was impudent to &s;ay it, and my Husband more &s;o to do it; the
Conclu|&s;ion of which was; that he ordered me to write to him to return it
immedi|ately; and, lea&s;t I &s;hould forget it, he gave me a very good
Beating. Well; I writ Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> an Account of the Dean's Wrath,
and he &s;ent me the fatal Bag by a Clergyman: I directly carried it to the
Dean, and hoped he would be plea&s;ed, by my punctual and ready Obedience to
his Will; but far otherwi&s;e it fell out, for the Dean flew into a
Pa&s;|&s;ion, for my daring to pre&s;ume to write for it, and gave me another
Beating.</P>
<P>But did not this more re&s;emble the Actions of a Lunatick than of
a Gentle|man of &s;uperior Wit and Knowledge? Indeed, I believe too much
Learning had turn'd his Head, or too deep a Search into the Secrets of Nature;
as nothing could e&s;cape his Ob&s;ervation. And this wrong Turn in his Brain,
I fancy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him a long time be|fore it was taken notice of,
as number|le&s;s Proofs might be produced; and even <PB N="170" REF="193">
among&s;t the Facts that I have related there are &s;ome &s;trong In&s;tances
of it; had he been le&s;s witty, it would &s;ooner have been taken notice of;
but, as the Poet ob&s;erves, 
<Q> 
<L>Great Wit to Madne&s;s &s;ure is near allied,</L> 
<L>And thin Partitions do their Bounds di|vide.</L></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Proof he gave of his Incivility was affronting the
Lord Lieutenant, at the Lord Mayor's Table; who, becau&s;e he had not paid his
Compliments to him in due Form, he very civilly acco&s;ted, by the
extraordinary Title of, you, Fellow with the blue String. Some little time
after this, he invited two Clergymen to take the Air with him, and when he got
them into a Coach, he did &s;o belabour them and knock their Heads together,
that they were obliged to cry out for A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>From this he fell into a deep Melan|cholly, and knew no body; I
was told the la&s;t &s;en&s;ible Words he uttered, were on this Occa&s;ion: Mr.
<HI>Handel,</HI> when <PB N="171" REF="194"> about to quit <HI>Ireland,</HI>
went to take his leave of him: The Servant was a con|&s;iderable Time, e'er he
could make the Dean under&s;tand him; which, when he did, he cry'd 
<Q REND="inline">"O! A <HI>German,</HI> and a Genius! A Prodigy!
admit him."</Q> The Servant did &s;o, ju&s;t to let Mr. <HI>Han|del</HI> behold
the Ruins of the greate&s;t Wit that ever liv'd along the Tide of Time, where
all at length are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>If ought el&s;e relating to him, &s;hould occur to my Remembrance,
I will faith|fully relate it; as I am certain it cannot but be acceptable to
the Public, who&s;e Intere&s;t he had evermore at Heart, and who&s;e Liberties
on all Occa&s;ions, he warm|ly and nobly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>'Tis mine, O honoured Shade, to cele|brate thy Goodne&s;s, without
extenuating thy Faults; I deal impartially, which is the true Ta&s;k of an
Hi&s;torian, and I would in&s;cribe thy Tomb-Stone, were I permitted; but
without Characters, Fame lives long. Thine will la&s;t, while Wit or Genius are
admired in this &s;ublunary Globe.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="195">However di&s;agreeable it may be to me, I
find I mu&s;t pro&s;ecute my own Hi&s;tory, till my leaving <HI>London,</HI> to
which Metro|polis I never intend to return, as has been in&s;inuated, in order
to hurt my Sub&s;crip|tion: While ever I can find Means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in
my native Country, where I have received more Favour, than I could rea&s;onably
hope for, I &s;hould e&s;teem my|&s;elf not only ungrateful, but unju&s;t to
rai&s;e Contributions on the Public, and carry the Money from this poor
I&s;land, to &s;pend it in a rich and opulent City.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides my Days of Vanity are over. The Woods, Groves,
Fountains, &s;acred Rece&s;&s;es, dear to the Mu&s;es, would be my Choice, even
had I a Fortune to entitle me to enjoy the Splendor of a Court in its utmo&s;t
Magnificence. O how I langui&s;h for Retirement; even as the Heart pant|eth
after the Water Brooks, &s;o longeth my Soul after it; where I might &s;it upon
&s;unle&s;s Side of &s;ome Romantic Moun|tain, Fore&s;t crown'd. I wi&s;h my
be&s;t and deare&s;t Friend, would take this into Con|&s;ideration, and in
&s;ome Part of his wide <PB N="173" REF="196"> extended Domains, afford his
Mu&s;e an humble Hermitage.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not then be di&s;tracted with Fears of an imperious
Landlord's Threats. No; your happy Tenant would pay her Debt in Weeds, which,
when I once told your Lord&s;hip, you very politely an&s;wered, that &s;uch
Ver&s;es as mine were the fine&s;t Flowers in the Garden of the Mu&s;es.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here relate to your Lord&s;hip, a little Circum&s;tance
which happened to me lately. I took a Lodging in <HI>Drum|condra-lane</HI>; the
two Ladies, (Si&s;ters) who keep the Hou&s;e, kindly invited me to Dinner; it
was very natural for me to enquire what Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction lived in our
Neighbourhood; they told me Lord <HI>Kingsborough</HI> had lately purcha&s;ed a
Hou&s;e in it, a mo&s;t worthy fine Gen|tleman. I happened to expre&s;s &s;o
much Plea&s;ure, at hearing this agreeable piece of News, and at the &s;ame
time &s;o warm|ly joined in their Sentiments, that one of the Ladies &s;aid:
Well, Madam, though you have made a My&s;tery of your Name, 
<PB N="174" REF="197"> I am certain you are Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>; I am
&s;ure you are the Per&s;on; becau&s;e you &s;peak of his Lord&s;hip, in the
very &s;ame Stile you have wrote of him. I have the two Volumes.</P>
<P>As I found they were prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Mrs.
<HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Favour, I confe&s;s'd they had gue&s;s'd right. But
whenever I want Concealment, if your Lord&s;hip is men|tioned, I will take Care
to be &s;ilent. Otherwi&s;e I &s;hall &s;oon betray my&s;elf, as out of the
Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth &s;peaketh. Though I am afraid, that like
holy David, it would be Grief, and Pain to me, and while I &s;at mu&s;ing the
Fire would kindle; the Sacred Fire of Friend&s;hip and Gratitude, would un|lock
my Tongue and give me Utterance, even though I had been born dumb.</P>
<P>Why, my dear Lord, were but a few Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, in
your Way of thinking, Earth it&s;elf would become a Paradi&s;e: no more would
the &s;orrowful Sighing of the Pri&s;oner, nor the Voice of Lamentation be
heard in our Streets, and 'tis with infinite Plea&s;ure, I &s;ee our long 
<PB N="175" REF="198"> &s;tain'd Nobility, <HI>who were only fa|mous for
undoing,</HI> and built their <HI>Characters on Rapes and Ruin,</HI> now
al|mo&s;t to a Man, not only ju&s;t, but bene|ficent; not only learned
them&s;elves, but Encouragers of Science in others. If a|mong&s;t our Country's
Worthies, I name you Lord <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> who have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
your&s;elf in Fields and Senates, in the Seats of the Mu&s;es, and Academic
Groves; who&s;e well try'd Valour has ap|proved it&s;elf; not in Ra&s;hne&s;s,
but a noble Intrepidity and Scorn of Death, whenever your God, your King, or
Coun|try, requir'd your Service; I hope it will not offend you, to &s;ay, may
your God, your King, and Country, make you as happy, as my much obliged, and
mo&s;t truly grateful Heart &s;incerely wi&s;hes, &s;hall ever be my ardent
Prayer.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has kindly vi&s;ited the Virtues of my Father on
his Daughter. I am &s;ure I had no other Claim, to the Fa|vours or Honours for
which I am indebt|ed to your Lord&s;hip, and for which I re&s;t your faithful

<P><PB N="176" REF="199">At length, through &s;trange
Vici&s;&s;itudes, and Variety of Misfortunes, finding I could get no Relief

late in Life, try my Fortune in <HI>Hibernia.</HI> But how to compa&s;s a
Journey and a Voyage without Money, was really a difficult Ta&s;k; to this End
I &s;et my Wits to Work, to find out whether any Per&s;ons of my own Country
were in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> from whom, by revealing my Di&s;|tre&s;s, I could
hope for Relief. At length I learned, that Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> was there, who
never rejected the Petition of the af|flicted, even though they had no other
Merit to recommend them, but that of Angui&s;h. My Suit was granted in the

<P><PB N="177" REF="200">How different was the Reception I met with,

&s;tiled the Son of Man? When we are told, that a Virgin &s;hould conceive;
that the Power of the highe&s;t &s;hould over-&s;hadow her! How was he then the
Son of Man? We are all order|ed to apply to our Heavenly Father, and therefore
may &s;tile our&s;elves the Children of God; why then is there any Excep|tion
made in this Ca&s;e?</P>
<P>I hardly dare allow my&s;elf the Liberty of thinking, le&s;t I
&s;hould do it too deep|ly, and Rea&s;on be my Di&s;ea&s;e; and yet I believe
it was given me to follow and &s;earch after Truth; where then &s;hall I find
it? not on Earth, no more than Peace or Ju&s;tice, who are long fled from
the&s;e lower Regions. Boldly then let me pur&s;ue them, even to the high

I wrote, in order to gain Relief, to a Prelate of <HI>Ireland,</HI> then
re&s;ident in <HI>Lon|don</HI>; <PB N="184" REF="207"> I &s;ent the Letter by
the Daughter of a di&s;&s;enting Clergyman, of who&s;e Ho|nour and Virtue I was
confident. He re|ceived her civilly, read over my Letter, and declared he did
not know me; but as he had &s;ome &s;light Knowledge of my Fa|mily, there was a
Guinea for me. This an&s;wered no End: But yet he gave me &s;ome Comfort, by
bidding her call again, and he would think of &s;omething for my Service:
Accordingly, in a Week's Time &s;he went again, and again; till at length his
Lord&s;hip vouch&s;afed to &s;end out a very rough An&s;wer, not in the lea&s;t
befitting his Function or Dignity, e&s;pe|cially to one whom he knew from her
Infancy, to be a Woman of good Birth, and Education.</P>
<P>But I re&s;olving to be as chuffy as he, &s;ent him in reality
another Epi&s;tle, not over-courteous I own; yet it wrought a better Effect,
than my complaining one produced, for his Gentleman came to me early next
Morning, with a very civil Letter; and produced ten Guineas, to my
un&s;peakable Joy; but there was a Draw|back <PB N="185" REF="208"> on my
Happine&s;s, for I was obli|ged to return ten Shillings Change, which I very
reluctantly complied with.</P>
<P>With this Sum my Son and I quitted <HI>London,</HI> and being on
the &s;aving Scheme, took Places in the Waggon. A mo&s;t tire|&s;ome Way of
travelling! <HI>May</HI> Morning we &s;et forth, our Slow-pac'd Cattle were
adorned with Ribbands and Flowers, and till then, I never under&s;tood the
meaning of the vulgar Expre&s;&s;ion, of being as fine as a Hor&s;e, for it
&s;eems it is cu&s;tomary on this Month, to pre&s;ent the Waggoners with a
Ribband, at every Inn; till our Flea-bitten Nags, were almo&s;t blind|ed by the
tawdry party-coloured flow|ing Honours of their Heads. I was really almo&s;t
fatigued to Death, for I was called up at three o'Clock in the Morn|ing, though
perhaps you don't &s;et out till five. Tea or Coffee, none to be had, unle&s;s
in &s;ome of the Towns: Indeed, if I could, like our Driver, have eat a
Breakfa&s;t of Salt Beef and Cabbage at that &s;queami&s;h Hour, it was laid
there ready. They bait not all Day; &s;o one <PB N="186" REF="209"> might have
an Appetite by Evening, but it happened not &s;o to me. The Heat and Du&s;t
quite depriv'd me of any Inclina|tion to Food, and e&s;pecially to the rough
Fare provided.</P>
<P>My chief Delight was li&s;tening to the Nightingale, who then
warbled forth her love-laboured Song, to indulge the Plea&s;ure of hearing the
&s;oft Warbler, pour forth her plaintive and harmonious Lay: I u&s;ed when we
were near our re&s;ting Place, to alight and walk through the flower-enamell'd
Meads, filled with Cow&s;lips, Primro&s;es, and wild Violets, for 
<Q> 
<L>In rural Scenes the Soul of Beauty reigns,</L> 
<L>The Soul of Plea&s;ure lives in rural Scenes.</L> 
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q> My Son and I found out a &s;weet Place,
canopy'd with Wood-bine, which had enringed it&s;elf in Plats about a large
Ap|ple Tree, who&s;e Blo&s;&s;oms &s;hed Perfumes, while the whole Sea&s;on
warbled round our <PB N="187" REF="210"> Heads; we &s;eated our&s;elves under
the wide &s;preading Shade, li&s;tening with De|light to tho&s;e wild
Mu&s;icians. Suddenly the Boy cry'd out, O Mamma what &s;hall I do? What is the
Matter, Child? Look at my Leg: I did &s;o, and behold a Snake had twi&s;ted up
it; I, though heartily &s;tartled, had Pre&s;ence of Mind &s;ufficient, to beg
he would not &s;trike it; he took my Advice, though indeed both he and I were
ready to faint, and the evil Worm crawled away, without doing him any
Prejudice. But not being well a&s;&s;ured that all the Serpent Race, &s;worn
Foe to Man, might be &s;o complai&s;ant, I was never after tempted to &s;it
down in Albion's fruitful Fields.</P>
<P>We lodged this Night at a &s;trange old Village, who&s;e Name I
have forgot; I believe the Inn had formerly been a Con|vent, by the numerous
little Cells and Cloy&s;ters, &s;mall Windows, almo&s;t dar|kened with
Je&s;&s;amine and Vines; it had a mo&s;t romantic melancholy Air, fit for
&s;tudious Contemplation, but not reple|ni&s;hed with rich Repa&s;t, or
chearful <PB N="188" REF="211"> Wine. The next Day being Sunday, a Day of
Re&s;t, we took up our Quarters at another Inn, where we got a Chicken and a
Pint of Wine, and lived &s;umptu|ou&s;ly.</P>
<P>We then walk'd out to &s;ee what kind of Curio&s;ity this Place
afforded, worth Remark; but finding none, we &s;trayed out on a Common, when
the fir&s;t Object which &s;truck my Sight, was that of a Man &s;u&s;pended
high in the Air, hanging in Chains on a Gibbet; &s;hocking as it was, it
engaged my Attention; I concluded he mu&s;t have been a mo&s;t undutiful Son,
when the Birds of Prey had devoured him, and the Ravens picked out his Eyes.
Suddenly I was &s;urprized with the Voice of a Man, who cried, O my dear
Co&s;hen Paddy, I wi&s;h tho&s;e who put you there for noting, were there
them&s;elves. I look|ed about, and &s;aw fifteen or twenty Men and Women lying
in a dry Ditch; I would have fled, but con&s;idering that might not be &s;afe,
I rather cho&s;e to walk at an ea&s;y Pace: One of the Fellows made up to us,
and a&s;ked where we were <PB N="189" REF="212"> going; I told him to our
Country, <HI>Ire|land.</HI> Arah, &s;aid he, are you a Catolic? I &s;aid I was!
Upon I which he &s;aid, Faith poor Paddy <HI>Lawler,</HI> who hangs there was a
good one. And what, Sir, brought him to &s;o unfortunate an End? Why, &s;aid
he, he was in Love with a proud &s;cornful Hu&s;&s;ey, and &s;he &s;lighted
him, &s;o he met her in this Plai&s;h, and becau&s;e &s;he would not accept of
his Shivility, he lent her a Nock on the Head, and &s;o he got his Will of her.
She died the next Day, after &s;he had given Information again&s;t him; to be
&s;ure her Skull was broke, but he did not de&s;hine that.</P>
<P>While he was telling me this Story, I trembled, but made the
be&s;t Speed I could to the Village, being infinitely more frightened at him,
than I had been at the Snake. He accompanied us there, for which I return|ed
him Thanks; how &s;incerely my Readers may judge. But I made a Virtue of
Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and gave him fair Words. Now &s;aid he, are not all the&s;e
Heretics damn'd Rogues? Ay, &s;aid I, and I hope our <PB N="190" REF="213">
true King will put all Villains to Death. Arrah, give me your Fi&s;t for that;
I was obliged to comply. When I got to the Inn I told him, I &s;hould be glad
of his Company, but that I had a jealous Hu&s;|band, who would certainly kill
me, if he found any Man in my Company. Damn the Rogue, &s;aid he, if I was as
you, I would make him a Cuckold in a crack. I de&s;ired he would plea&s;e to
accept of a Pot of Drink, which he did, and making a Leg, walk'd off leaving us
unmole&s;t|ed, and I ble&s;t God I had purcha&s;ed Life at &s;o cheap a
Rate.</P>
<P>That &s;oft An&s;wers turn away Wrath, is mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured; for
I remember &s;ome Years ago, when the <HI>Cavan</HI> Rabble were up in Arms, my
Mother, Si&s;ter, and I, went to pay a Vi&s;it at <HI>Rathfarnam,</HI> to the
Lady of our excellent 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eaton Stannard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who
re&s;igned.</NOTE>Recorder. On our return home, we were &s;urrounded by a Pack
of the&s;e Wretches, who ordered my Father's Coachman to pull off his Hat to
them, which he refu&s;ing, and they be|ing <PB N="191" REF="214"> all armed
with &s;hort thick Oak Tree Clubs, they &s;wore we &s;hould not ride in a
Coach, and they walk; my Mother, with &s;urprizing Pre&s;ence of Mind, &s;aid
Gentlemen, you are very welcome to the Coach, my Daughter and I will walk, to
oblige you with it; which, Villains, Ruf|fians, and Murtherers as they were,
they would not permit, but only de&s;ired we might Huzza for them, this
notwith|&s;tanding our Terror, we chearfully did; and my Mother &s;aid,
Gentlemen per|haps you are dry, and gave them a Crown, with which they were
&s;o well plea&s;ed, that they huzza'd for us, offering to guard us &s;afe to
Town; but &s;he alledging that would be too much trouble, they left us with a
kind A&s;&s;urance, that they would drink our Healths, and fight for us any
Time we &s;tood in need of their Pro|tection.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened to us till we got to <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>;
we took a Survey of the Cathedral Church, which had nothing like Beauty to
recommend it, any more <PB N="192" REF="215"> than the old black Walls which
environ Part of the City.</P>
<P>Next Day we &s;et out for <HI>Parkgate,</HI> which was crowded
with Nobility and Gentry, waiting for a fair Wind; here we were &s;o long
detained, that my Pur&s;e was quite exhau&s;ted, even my la&s;t Shilling gone;
this was a &s;ad Situation, we were fixed to a Point without any Power of
Moving one way or another, wanting the nece&s;&s;ary Agent Money. There was but
one Way left, which was even to apply to Lady <HI>Kildare,</HI> who was there;
but being a&s;hamed to do it in my Name, I e'en did it in my Son's, who waited
on her Lady&s;hip with it, met a favourable Reception, and brought home a
Guinea. The Wind &s;prung up fair and we embar|ked on board the Race Hor&s;e.
As I am always deadly Sick at Sea, I cho&s;e to keep on Deck, as long as I
po&s;&s;ibly could. My Son being well inured to the wat'ry Ele|ment, &s;kipped
about, and &s;ung Marine Songs. Mo&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers went to their
Cabbins, when Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> the Clergyman, &s;eeing my Boy &s;peak to
me, <PB N="193" REF="216"> a&s;ked me, was not that young Lad's Name
<HI>Pilkington?</HI> I &s;aid Yes! I thought &s;o &s;aid he, for he is very
like Mr. <HI>Pilking|ton</HI> the Clergyman; he has &s;ome Cau&s;e to be &s;o,
Sir, for he is his Son. How can you an&s;wer for that, Madam? Why in|deed, Sir,
I have &s;ome Cau&s;e of Knowledge of it, for I am that worthy Divine's Wife,
and the Boy's Mother. The Gentleman confe&s;&s;ed the Force of my Plea, and
ex|pre&s;&s;ed great Compa&s;&s;ion for us both; and I do verily believe, had
he known our Circum&s;tances, he would have added Re|lief to Pity.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to be a learned and worthy Gentleman, which I had the
better Op|portunity of di&s;covering, as he, my Son, my&s;elf, and a Gentleman
whom I did not know, &s;at all Night in Lady <HI>Kildare</HI>'s Coach, which
was la&s;h'd upon Deck. We there were becalm'd, and among&s;t other things, Mr.
<HI>Hud&s;on</HI> &s;aid, that had he ever been &s;o unfortunate to take a
common Woman, and &s;he had brought forth a Son &s;o like him, as mine was to 
<PB N="194" REF="217"> my Hu&s;band, he would at lea&s;t have con|cluded that
to be his own.</P>
<P>Upon which I related to him a true Story. A Servant Maid who had
lived with Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> enquired of the
Per&s;ons who kept the next Hou&s;e, who were the new Lodgers they had got; the
Name made her but more inqui&s;itive, and &s;he begg'd I would permit her to
&s;ee me, but as I had met with many a Trick in Life, I bid my Son and Daughter
&s;it behind the Bed Curtain, and then de&s;ir'd her to come up; I a&s;ked her,
did &s;he know me; &s;he &s;aid no indeed! but &s;he had lived with one Mr.
<HI>Pilkington</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who had turn'd his Wife out of Doors;
and that he lived on <HI>Lazer</HI>'s <HI>Hill.</HI> And what &s;aid I were the
Names of the Chil|dren? Why, returned &s;he, there was Ma&s;ter <HI>Billy,</HI>
Mi&s;s <HI>Betty,</HI> and Ma&s;ter <HI>Jack!</HI> And how came you to leave
him? Why, indeed he was beating Mi&s;s and Ma&s;ter &s;adly, and I a&s;ked him
why he did it? he &s;aid becau&s;e they were none of his! <PB N="195" REF="218"> Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;ure Ma&s;ter Jack is yours, for he is your own
Picture. Ay, &s;aid he, the Mother was thinking of me when he was got. In
troth, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I don't doubt that, for I believe you were the
neare&s;t Per&s;on to her; for which Offence, &s;he was directly
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: And could he have found Matter again&s;t her Life, he would
have pro&s;ecuted her.</P>
<P>The Children knew her, and whatever little Favours &s;he had by
Stealth done for them in my Exile, I did my utmo&s;t to re|turn to her. A
Benefit is &s;eldom lo&s;t.</P>
<P>At length the Day broke and di&s;|covered us my native Earth; I
hail'd the Mother Land which gave me Birth, but knowing how little Money I had,
did not chu&s;e to Land at <HI>Dunlary,</HI> which mu&s;t be attended with more
Expence, than I had any Po&s;&s;ibility of an&s;wering: The other
Pa&s;&s;engers all went a&s;hore; 'twas about three o'Clock, and my Boy and I
waited in the Ship, not doubting but we &s;hould be &s;oon at
<HI>Ring&s;end</HI>; but it happened <PB N="196" REF="219"> otherwi&s;e, for we
were becalm'd; we once more took our Seats in the Coach, and found there the
Hammer Cloth, in which I wrapt my&s;elf, and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. In the Night
I was awaked by the terrible Cur&s;es of the Captain of the Ship, who &s;wore
dreadfully we &s;hould be that Mo|ment lo&s;t. I dropt the Gla&s;s, and a&s;ked
him what was the Matter; he &s;aid he had fallen a&s;leep, and tru&s;ted the
Ship to one who had directly thrown us on the <HI>North Bull.</HI> And are we
then to be lo&s;t? I &s;ee no Remedy, we &s;hall &s;trike in a Minut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> I pulled my Son, who laughed at my
Fears, which really were very great. The Ship &s;truck upon a Sand-Bank, with
&s;uch Force, that it rebounded on another, and beat it almo&s;t to Pieces.
However, the Morn aro&s;e, that gilded all the flowery Plains, and pre&s;ented
to our View a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect, both of Land and Water; the Tide
left our Ship on the Strand, &s;o that without Expence or Dif|ficulty, we
walked to <HI>Ring&s;end.</HI></P>
<P>Here we took a little decent Lodging, till I could be able to
remove to <HI>Dublin</HI>; <PB N="197" REF="220"> and I immediately
di&s;patched my Son, with a Letter to a Nobleman, whom I had formerly &s;een at
my Father's; who obligingly &s;ent me a Guinea: This en|abled me to di&s;mi&s;s
my Lodging; my Son brought me a Coach, in which we put our Portmanteau, and
remov'd to an Apartment he had taken for me at a &s;mall Rent in
<HI>Aungier-&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>Well, Reader, I have now brought you with me to <HI>Hibernia</HI>;
where you will &s;uppo&s;e the Daughter of a Gentleman &s;o univer&s;ally
e&s;teemed, as Doctor <HI>Van Lewin,</HI> would, after &s;o long an Exile, have
&s;ure|ly found &s;ome Friends.</P>
<P>I wrote a very mannerly Epi&s;tle to my beloved Spou&s;e, in which
I &s;lightly men|tioned his mercile&s;s Treatment of me, and his poor Children;
and told him, that if he would pay me the Sixty five Pounds, for which I had
his Bond in Coun&s;ellor <HI>Smith</HI>'s Hands, I would not only forego the
Intere&s;t, which amounted to a con&s;iderable Sum, but al&s;o immedi|ately
leave the Kingdom; provided al&s;o, he would give me A&s;&s;urance, that he 
<PB N="198" REF="221"> would take Care of his younge&s;t Son. I leave every
Per&s;on of Candour, to judge whether or not this was a fair Propo&s;al: And I
mo&s;t &s;olemnly prote&s;t to Almighty God, that I had no other intention, as
there was not at that Time, above forty Pages of my Fir&s;t Volume wrote;
how|ever he &s;corned to &s;end me an An&s;wer of any kind. Well, I wrote
again, yet &s;till his Reverence was &s;ilent as the Grave.</P>
<P>This I confe&s;s a little incen&s;ed me; and fir&s;t determined me
in the De&s;ign, of publickly vindicating my Innocence, and laying open, for
univer&s;al Benefit, his unparallel'd Character; in which, if I have err'd,
'tis through Tenderne&s;s, as his Actions,

Child.</P>
<P>The Coun&s;ellor was at a Lo&s;s how to act in &s;o critical a
Point. He knew Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Talent, of traducing every Per&s;on,
who did not act in Compliance to his Inclination; and, on the other Hand,
Ju&s;tice compell'd him to think I had a Right to be paid, what had &s;o long
and &s;o unlawfully been withheld from me; and by which I was drove to &s;uch
Extremi|ties in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore wrote to him, and I &s;up|po&s;e acquainted him, how
much it was out of his Power, as an hone&s;t Man, to defend him from the
Con&s;equences of that Bond. Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> finding all his Policy of
no Effect in this particular Af|fair, conde&s;cended to honour the
Coun|&s;ellor with a mo&s;t &s;tupid Epi&s;tle, in which he in&s;inuated, 
<Q REND="inline">"that his Motive for giv|ing that Bond, was in
order to make me live virtuou&s;ly for the future, which <PB N="200" REF="223">
he could &s;ufficiently prove I had not done."</Q> [Produce your Evidence Mr.
Par&s;on.] 
<Q REND="inline">"That if he was allow'd only &s;uch Time to pay
it, as his Circum|&s;tances would not allow, he would try what Remedy he could
obtain from a Court of Equity, when a full State of the Ca&s;e was laid before
them."</Q> The&s;e are pretty near the Words; I wi&s;h you had my dear
Spou&s;e, as it mu&s;t have gi|ven Plea&s;ure to any Court, to &s;ee you look
CONSCIENCE in the Face.</P>
<P>But not to be tedious, after much Trou|ble and Vexation of Spirit,
I procured from him twenty Pounds at one Payment, with which I took a little
rural Habitation near <HI>Bow-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>I wrote a Letter to my dear old Friend, Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and
told him, that however improbable it might &s;eem to him, I had actually Twenty
Pounds in my Pocket; and added, that I had 
<Q> 
<L>A little Room to lodge a Friend,</L> 
<L>A River at my Garden's End,</L></Q> <PB N="201" REF="224"> and
wanted nothing, but the Delights of his Conver&s;ation, to make my Situation
com|pleatly agreeable. I believe Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> had not till then heard of
my Expedition, &s;o that my Letter mu&s;t have &s;urpriz'd him. By the return
of the Po&s;t, I re|ceived from his dear Hand the following humorous Epi&s;tle.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. <HI>Laetitia Pilkington,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOU frolick&s;ome Farce of For|tune: What! is there then
ano|ther Act to come of you yet? I thought you had &s;ome Time ago, made your
final Exit. Well, but without Wit or Com|pliment, I am glad to hear you are
&s;o tolerably alive. I have your agreeable Narrative from <HI>Dublin</HI>
before me, and &s;hall, as you de&s;ire, an&s;wer every Para|graph in its Turn,
without once con&s;ider|ing its Importance or Connection. In the fir&s;t Place,
you &s;ay I have for many Years been the kind Pre&s;erver of your Life. In
this, I think I have no great Merit, as you &s;eemed to &s;et &s;o little
Va|lue on it your&s;elf, otherwi&s;e you would <PB N="202" REF="225"> have
con&s;idered, that Poverty was the mo&s;t helple&s;s Handmaid, that ever
wait|ed on a high &s;pirited Lady. You &s;eem to have a Glimp&s;e of a new
World before you; think a little how you are to &s;queeze through the Crowd,
with &s;uch a Bundle at your Back, and do not &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;|&s;ible, you
can have a Grain of Wit, till you have twenty Pounds clear in your Pocket; with
half that Sum, a greater Sinner than you, may look the Devil in the Face.</P>
<P>Few People of Sen&s;e will turn their Backs on a Woman of Wit,
that does not look as if &s;he came to borrow Money of them; but when Want
brings her to her Wit's End, every Fool will have Wit enough to avoid her.</P>
<P>I am not &s;ure your Spou&s;e's having ta|ken another Wife,
before you came over, might not have proved the only Means, of his becoming a
better Hu&s;band to you; for had he pick'd up a Fortune, the Hu&s;h of your
Prior Claim to him, might have been worth a better &s;eparate 
<PB N="203" REF="226"> Maintenance, than what you are now like|ly to get out of
him.</P>
<P>As to my Health and Spirits, they are as u&s;ual, and full as
&s;trong as any body's that has enjoy'd them the &s;ame Number of Years.</P>
<P>If the Value I have for you, gives you any Credit in your own
Country, pray &s;tretch it as far as you think it can be &s;er|viceable to you;
for under all the Rubbi&s;h of your Misfortunes, I could &s;ee your Merit
&s;parkle like a lo&s;t Jewel. I have no greater Plea&s;ure, than in placing my
E&s;teem on tho&s;e, who can feel and value it. Had you been born to a large
For|tune, your &s;hining Qualities might have put half the re&s;t of your Sex
out of Coun|tenance. If any of them are uncharitable enough to call this
Flattery, tell them what a poor Devil you are, and let that &s;ilence them.</P>
<P>I hope you have but one Volume of your Works in the Pre&s;s,
becau&s;e if it meets with any Succe&s;s, I believe I could give you &s;ome
natural Hints, which, in <PB N="204" REF="227"> the ea&s;y Dre&s;s of your Pen,
might a good deal enliven it.</P>
<P>You pay your Court very ill to me, by depreciating the natural
Ble&s;&s;ings on your Side the Water: Pray what have we to boa&s;t off, that
you want, but Wealth and in&s;olent Dominion? Are not the Glory of God's
Creation there?&mdash;Woman, lovely Woman there, in their highe&s;t Lu&s;tre! I
have &s;een &s;everal and frequent Samples of them here; and have heard of
many, not only from your&s;elf, but others, who for the agreeable
Enter|tainments of &s;ocial Life, have not their equal Play-Fellows in <HI>Old
England.</HI></P>
<P>And pray what would Life be worth without them? Dear &s;oft
Souls, for now too they are lavi&s;h of Favours, which in my Youth, they would
have trembled to tru&s;t me with. In a Word, if in&s;tead of the Sea, I had
only the dry Ground <HI>Alps</HI> to get over, I &s;hould think it but a Trip
to <HI>Dublin</HI>; in the mean time, we mu&s;t even compound for &s;uch
Interviews, as the Po&s;t or Packet can bring or &s;end, to</P>

Cibber.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="228">I communicated this Letter to Lord Chief
Baron <HI>Bowes,</HI> the Hon. <HI>Arthur Hill,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and
&s;everal Per&s;ons of Ta&s;te, who were infinitely delighted with it, as they
were with many others, which I had from Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and which would
con|&s;iderably have embeli&s;hed my Work, had I not the Misfortune to lo&s;e
them, by lending them to a Man of Di&s;tinction, who by &s;ome Accident
mi&s;laid them; &s;o I mu&s;t e'en entertain you, with the neat Product of my
own Brain.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Victor,</HI> whom I have mentioned in my Second Volume,
and who is now Trea&s;urer of the Theatre Royal in <HI>Smock-Alley,</HI> came
to vi&s;it me &s;everal Times, and frequently favoured us with an Order to
&s;ee the Play, as we were upon a very friendly and familiar Footing. My Son
u&s;ed, when he had an Inclination, to call on my Friend for a Pa&s;s; one
Night he &s;ent once or twice for that Purpo&s;e, when the Gentleman was
abroad? What does the giddy Creature do, but aukwardly counterfeits his Hand in
an Order for two. He told me of it, and &s;aid he was <PB N="206" REF="229">
&s;ure Mr. <HI>Victor</HI> would not deny it, when he was informed who had
taken that Free|dom with his Name: I laugh'd at the Reflection of the Je&s;t,
when it came to be known, as Mr. <HI>Victor</HI> had had the Boy in his Arms
when an Infant. Ac|cordingly we took a Coach, went to the Play, and the Forgery
&s;eem'd to pa&s;s ex|tremely well. The fir&s;t Act was &s;carce begun, when a
Per&s;on entered, and as the Hou&s;e was thin of Company, tapt my Son on the
Shoulder. I did not apprehend the Cau&s;e of it, but began to grow unea&s;y
when I found him &s;tay a full Hour; at length he returned, and informed me,
that he had been, at the In&s;tigation of Mr. <HI>Sh&mdash;n,</HI> arre&s;ted
by two Con&s;tables, from whom he was only delivered by the Sollicitations of
Mr. <HI>Victor.</HI> This greatly a&s;toni&s;hed me, as I thought Mr.
<HI>Sh&mdash;n</HI> ought to have had a little more Re&s;pect for the Son of a
Clergyman, e&s;pecially as he was well convinced, that as I knew his Father,
(whom <HI>the Dean</HI> entertained more as a Buffoon, than a Friend or
Com|panion) and his Mother, I had a Power <PB N="207" REF="230"> of
furni&s;hing the World with &s;ome Anec|dotes, which were hitherto unrevealed;
but the Scheme of letting my Son e&s;cape was not any Lenity in him, but a Bait
to catch me going out, whom they imagined they &s;hould di&s;cover by the Boy;
but it happened that a Gentleman handed me me out, by which this generous
Intent was fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>His little deformed Brother had the A&s;&s;urance to tell my Son
&s;ome Nights after, that Mr. <HI>S&mdash;n</HI> would e&s;teem any Satire I
wrote on him a Panegyrick; which when I heard, in order to oblige him with a
Compliment to his Ta&s;te, I inclos'd to Mr. <HI>Victor</HI> the following
Lines, to be forwarded to his Mightine&s;s. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To Mr. S&mdash;n.</HEAD>
<L>FAIN would the Mu&s;e record thy Crimes,</L>
<L>And leave them to &s;ucceeding Times;</L>
<L>But finds it difficult to trace,</L>

<L>Be doom'd like him to Tran&s;portation.</L>
<L>But who thy De&s;tiny can alter?</L>
<L>Thy very Looks, pre&s;age a Halter.</L>
<L>Oh may I live to hail the Day,</L>
<L>When the glad Players &s;hall &s;urvey,</L>
<L>Their Tyrant &s;tript of all Command,</L>
<L>High on the well fixt Ladder &s;tand.</L>
<L>And taking thence, one glorious Swing,</L>

<L>Then &s;hall tho&s;e Cloaths, in which di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>You'd &s;eem a Lord to vulgar Eyes.</L>
<L>Did not thy ba&s;e and abject Mien,</L>
<L>Betray the Beggar's Brat within,</L>
<L>Be by thy Kin&s;man Hangman worn,</L>
<L>And &s;till a Scoundrel Thief adorn.</L>
</LG></Q> This, Sir, I mo&s;t humbly beg your Ac|ceptance of, as
'tis indeed the only thing which I could without Di&s;&s;imulation &s;ay of
you.</P>
<P>I was told, that this worthy Gentleman, in a Letter to the
inimitable Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"We &s;hine like <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and
<HI>Pollux,</HI> <PB N="210" REF="233"> you adorn <HI>Great Britain,</HI> while
I illu|minate <HI>Hibernia.</HI>"</Q> Nothing &s;ure, but his matchle&s;s
Ignorance, could have drawn &s;o di&s;proportionate a Parrallel. I remem|ber
the fir&s;t time I had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> perform,
it was the Character of King <HI>Lear</HI>; I was in one of the Boxes, and when
he came to the mad Scene, I was &s;o much affected at it, that I got up
in&s;en&s;ibly, and was going out, till I was wak'd, like one from a Trance, by
the Lady who accompanied me, pull|ing me by the Sleeve, and demanding where I
was going? and to &s;ay the Truth, 
<Q> 
<L>He made me Marble, with too much conceiving.</L> 
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q> I am certain no Per&s;on was ever
capable of making the Audience feel a Part, which they did not &s;incerely do
them&s;elves; and I'm convinced, Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> never play'd a Part,
wherein he did not, through the whole Performance, believe him&s;elf the Man;
whereas <HI>Pollux,</HI> as <HI>Sh&mdash;n</HI> <PB N="211" REF="234">
mode&s;tly &s;tiles him&s;elf, is no other than Tom <HI>Sh&mdash;n,</HI> though
he change Dre&s;s and Perriwig twenty Times a Night; he is indeed, <HI>Semper
Eadem, wor&s;e</HI> and <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> as my Countryman has it.</P>
<P>This brings to my Memory, a Story of a very eminent Player, who
was to perform the Part of <HI>Hannibal.</HI> A Nobleman behind the Scenes,
took the Liberty to give a Twitch to one Tye of his Peruke. The enraged Hero
turned on his Heel, and with his martial Trun|cheon, &s;mote the Peer over the
Cheek. 
<Q> 
<L>A Blow, by Heaven! and from an Actor's Hand!</L> 
<L>He did not &s;tab him, for that were poor Revenge.</L></Q> But
when he came off the Stage, my Lord told him, he believed he thought him&s;elf
really <HI>Hannibal,</HI> when he could give with Impunity, &s;uch an
Indignity, to a Man of his Con&s;equence. My Lord, &s;aid the Player, if I did
not think my&s;elf <HI>Hannibal,</HI> I &s;hould never be able to make 
<PB N="212" REF="235"> the Audience do &s;o.&mdash;So much for Theatrical
Affairs.</P>
<P>I now began &s;eriou&s;ly to re&s;olve on Publi&s;hing my
Writings, and to that End had Propo&s;als printed. Per&s;ons were at fir&s;t a
little timorous, le&s;t I &s;hould print a Li&s;t of Sub&s;cribers, and by that
Means they might unwittingly give Of|fence; but when I declared no Names
&s;hould be in&s;erted, I had a numerous Contribution, from all the Nobility,
Cler|gy, and Gentry; among&s;t whom, when I name our excellent <HI>Lord
Chancellor,</HI> in whom Titles and Honours had made no Alteration, but that of
increa&s;ing his Politene&s;s, Munificence, and Liberali|ty, to every
Individual; our Patriot <HI>Speaker</HI>; and worthy Recorder <HI>Eaton
Stannard</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> I believe no Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, will
blu&s;h to have their Names mentioned.</P>
<P>Well, at length my fir&s;t Volume was fini&s;hed, and I wrote a
bantering Letter to Sir <HI>J&mdash;n F&mdash;ke,</HI> to whom I have the
Di&s;honour to be allied, to tell him, that I intended to dedicate it to him, 
<PB N="213" REF="236"> <HI>Nemine Con.</HI> He, who&s;e Mind is truly pictured
in his ill-favoured Face, told my Son, that for him&s;elf, every Body would
take it as a thing done to make him ridi|culous, &s;ince he had not any
Accompli&s;h|ments, that might merit an Encomium, which indeed was true, except
'tis his matchle&s;s Impudence, in keeping Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of an E&s;tate,
which his own Mo|ther, the Lady &mdash;, told him he had no more Right to, than
to the Dukedom of <HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P>When his &s;uppo&s;ed Father, Sir <HI>B&mdash;ph F&mdash;ke</HI>
died, this young Spark was an En&s;ign in the Army, and &s;tepping at once into
Affluence, he being naturally of a covetous Di&s;po&s;ition, refu&s;ed to pay
his Mother the Jointure which &s;he claim'd, and was going to commence a Suit
with her; when one Morning &s;he called on him and &s;aid, Hark ye, Sir
<HI>John,</HI> do you re|&s;olve to go to Law with me for what's my Right? He
begg'd to be excu&s;ed, but told her, Self-Pre&s;ervation was the fir&s;t Law
of Nature; &s;o it is Sir, &s;aid &s;he, call|ing him by his real Father's
Name; then <PB N="214" REF="237"> you are no longer Sir <HI>J&mdash;n
F&mdash;ke</HI> which I will go in&s;tantly and make pub|lick.</P>
<P>He fell dutifully on his Knees, entreat|ed her Pardon for his
Di&s;obedience, and promis'd for the future to pay all proper Re&s;ignation to
her &s;uperior Under&s;tand|ing.&mdash;This, Sir <HI>John,</HI> you and many
others know to be Fact.</P>
<P>He pointed out to me, as a &s;ubject for everla&s;ting Prai&s;e,
my beloved Lord <HI>Kingsborough,</HI> then Sir <HI>Robert King,</HI> and
though I had not the Felicity I have &s;ince experienced of a per&s;onal
Acquain|tance with him, yet the Character plea&s;ed me, and accordingly I wrote
a trifling Dedication, far inferior to his Merit, which notwith&s;tanding he
kindly accepted, and &s;ent me the following Letter:

<P>I Return you my Thanks for the Fa|vour of your Dedication,

that his Lord&s;hip came to me, and giving me ten Guineas in a &s;ort of

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am extremely honoured, by that E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip
which you profe&s;s for me in your really fine Copy of Ver&s;es; yet, when I
reflect on a late Letter of yours, which I &s;till have by me, I cannot help
thinking my&s;elf as un|worthy of your Prai&s;es, as I was of your Threats.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, Madam, Your very humble Servant,
&mdash;.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I concluded from this Letter, that I had lo&s;t all the Share in
his E&s;teem, that I once flattered my&s;elf I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; which
&s;hews the In&s;tability of human Af|fairs.</P>
<P>And here, gentle Reader, my Story and my Life draw to a Period. I
am con|vinced, from the pre&s;ent Situation of my Health, that I &s;hall never
live to &s;ee this Volume publi&s;hed. It is the only Legacy I have to leave my
poor Boy, who, I fear, <PB N="223" REF="246"> will meet with many Enemies, on
ac|count of my Writings, when it will be out of my Power to protect him. But
Oh! ye Good and Great, to you and the Almighty I commend him; and hope that
Tenderne&s;s which melted you to com|pa&s;&s;ionate my Woes, will incline you
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Believe me, my dear Lord <HI>King&s;borough,</HI> no
Creature living holds your Lord&s;hip in higher E&s;teem than he; and, as you
told me in one of your Letters, your Inclinations were, and En|deavours

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>I Promi&s;ed in my Propo&s;als for print|ing this Volume by
Sub&s;cription, to give the Readers a Key to the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third
Volumes, in this Place; but having been advi&s;ed by &s;ome judici|ous Friends,
that &s;uch a thing would only tend to create ill Blood, and excite a
Re|&s;entment too powerful to be with&s;tood by &s;o incon&s;iderable a
Per&s;on as my&s;elf, it has been thought expedient to furni&s;h them with an
Account of my Mother's Death; which I am the more capable of doing, as I
remained with her to her la&s;t Moments.</P>
<P>She had been a long time in a declin|ing State of Health, having
an extreme bad Stomach, and Dige&s;tion: Nor did <PB N="225" REF="248"> &s;he
imagine that Nature could have held out as long as it did.</P>
<P>She never &s;eemed in the lea&s;t unea&s;y at the Knowledge of her
approaching End; often declaring, that if &s;he could take me with her to
Felicity, &s;he would leave this World without Reluctance.</P>
<P>And indeed, I am not &s;urprized, that her maternal Love extended
&s;o far, as &s;he even then fore&s;aw the Calamities which I have &s;ince
&s;u&s;tained; and knew, that if the World, at her fir&s;t &s;etting out as a
Writer, with her extraordinary Ta|lents, &s;carce afforded her Bread, my Fate
mu&s;t be even harder, except I met the Patronage of &s;ome illu&s;trious
Per|&s;on.</P>
<P>And Providence &s;eemed inclinable to comply with her Wi&s;h; for,
in the lat|ter End of <HI>June,</HI> 1751, I was &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent
Pleuretic Fever, which I got by an extreme Cold, I &s;ent for Doctor
<HI>Fergus,</HI> a mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;ician, and worthy Gentleman; my Mother
was at this time &s;o weak as to be obliged to keep her Bed: When the Doctor
&s;aw me, and <PB N="226" REF="249"> heard the Symptoms of my Di&s;order, he
told me I was a dead Man; that I &s;hould have applied &s;ome Days &s;ooner,
&s;ince he was now of Opinion it had got too far the A&s;cendency over me for
any Cure to be effected: However, he ordered me to be blooded four times that
Day, and then went up to my Mother's Apartment.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked him his Advice upon her own Ca&s;e and mine; and he
told her a little too frankly, that Nature might do &s;omething for my
Recovery, but that her Death was inevitable; &s;he &s;miling, &s;aid to him,
That the Worms would have but a poor Fea&s;t of her, &s;he being quite worn
away.</P>
<P>Well, I was blooded according to his Order, and the Fever abated
con&s;iderably. I had the next Night an exce&s;&s;ive Per&s;pi|ration, which
carried off all the Symp|toms except a little Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the Morning a young Lady, who honour'd me with a particular
Regard, came to &s;ee me. She was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively delighted at my &s;peedy
and unexpected Recovery, that &s;he re&s;olved to &s;pend the 
<PB N="227" REF="250"> Day with me; and my poor Mother, ever willing to
contribute to my Satisfac|tion, told the Nur&s;e-keeper that &s;he found
her&s;elf much better, and de&s;ired &s;he might be brought to my Apartment;
accord|ingly &s;he lifted my dear Mother like a Child, in her Arms, and placed
her in an Elbow-chair by my Bed-&s;ide: She affect|ed, in order to plea&s;e me,
to be extremely chearful; and the young Lady kneeled down, and a&s;ked her
Ble&s;&s;ing; telling her &s;he wanted to have a Wedding in the Hou&s;e
in&s;tead of a Burying from it. My Mother, who retained her Spirits and good
Humour to the la&s;t, gave us both her Ble&s;&s;ing very devoutly, and her
&s;in|cere Permi&s;&s;ion to marry. I had a &s;mall Chicken dre&s;&s;ed for my
Dinner, of which my Mother partook, but her Stomach was too weak to keep it, or
a Gla&s;s of Wine, which &s;he drank after it; &s;o &s;he was obliged to be
carried to Bed.</P>
<P>After her Departure, as the Weather was va&s;tly warm, I ordered
the Maid to open the Sa&s;h-window; and, in the mean time, comes the Doctor; we
were ju&s;t <PB N="228" REF="251"> going to drink Tea: This Gentleman is a
little near-&s;ighted; but &s;eeing the Sa&s;h up, and Company in the Room,
What, &s;aid he, this poor Boy's gone; I thought &s;o! And was going out: No,
Sir, &s;aid I, I am &s;till alive: Alive! &s;aid he, And what are all the&s;e
People doing here? He immediately went and darkened the Win|dow, taking the
Company by the Shoul|ders, and turning them out; he then charged the
Nur&s;e-keeper, not to open the Window, nor let any Per&s;on talk to me for a
Week.</P>
<P>I thought this Pre&s;cription a little hard, as I imagined
my&s;elf quite well: Accordingly the next Morning I &s;ent the Nur&s;e out, got
up, dre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf, and went to my poor Mother; &s;he was agreeably
&s;urprized to &s;ee me, but upon opening the Curtains, I found &s;he had a
great Ca&s;t in her Eyes, which &s;hocked me extremely, and &s;he told me, that
every thing appeared double to her; I did not give her to under&s;tand, that I
perceived it, but told her, &s;he looked better than I had known her do a long 
<PB N="229" REF="252"> Time. She &s;aid the Doctor had given her over: Why &s;o
he did me, Madam, and yet you &s;ee I am alive; and if you will take my
Pre&s;cription, I dare &s;ay you will make a Fibber of him.</P>
<P>She &s;aid &s;he would, and I propo&s;ed, that my Spou&s;e as I
call'd Mi&s;s <HI>C&mdash;m,</HI> and &s;he, and I, &s;hould the next Morning
go to <HI>Chapel Izod,</HI> a Place about three Miles from Dublin, and &s;pend
the Day. She &s;eemed quite plea&s;ed with my Re|que&s;t, and &s;ent to have a
Landau be&s;poke for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Morning &s;he was up and dre&s;&s;ed before me, and was as
&s;prightly as I had ever &s;een her, tho' quite weak, in&s;o|much that &s;he
was obliged to be carried into the Machine and out again.</P>
<P>We &s;et out before Breakfa&s;t, and went thro' the
<HI>Phoenix</HI> Park, it was a fine Day, and we had the Landau opened; the
fre&s;h Air va&s;tly revived her, and &s;he repeated a good many Lines of the
Poem on <HI>Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t</HI>; &s;he even complained of being hungry.
When we came to the Tavern, I ordered &s;ome Tea; and to <PB N="230" REF="253">
my infinite Surprize, my Mother called for a Plate of Ham, and &s;ome Oil and
Vinegar, eat very hearty, and drank two Gla&s;&s;es of White-wine.</P>
<P>The Readers may judge that I was overjoyed at &s;eeing &s;o fair a
Pro&s;pect of her Recovery; &s;he after made a Shift to walk down into the
Flower-Garden, and &s;eemed to enjoy the balmy Fragrance with great inward
Satisfaction. I then went in, and be&s;poke Dinner, which was young Ducks, and
Green Pea&s;e; my Mother lay down and &s;lept 'till 'twas ready, at which Hour
&s;he ro&s;e, and eat very hearty: There happened to be a Couple of Gentlemen
in the Hou&s;e of our Ac|quaintance, who after Dinner joined Com|pany with us;
and my Mother told them that the Doctor had given her over, but &s;he-was
re&s;olved to outlive the whole Faculty. In &s;hort, &s;he related twenty
agreeable Stories to our infinite En|tertainment.</P>
<P>Little did I imagine, that our pre&s;ent Joy was only the Prologue
to the Grief I too &s;oon after received. We did not leave <HI>Chapel Izod</HI>
till Ten at Night, <PB N="231" REF="254"> when we all &s;et out in the Landau;
I know not whether the Air might not have been very fatal to her, for no
&s;ooner were we got a hundred Yards, but &s;he began to cough, and continued
&s;o all that Night, during which I &s;at up with her.</P>
<P>We lodged at this Time in the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Sheil,</HI> in
<HI>Phraper-Lane, Dublin:</HI> We had a fir&s;t and &s;econd Floor, for which
we con&s;tantly paid Ten Shillings and Six-pence a Week; the Man of the Hou&s;e
had been a Pari&s;h-Clerk, and had held that Dignity under my Father for &s;ome
Years; he afterwards turned Farrier, or Hor&s;e-Doctor, in which meeting with
no Succe&s;s, he came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> took a Hou&s;e which he let to
Lodgers, except the Parlours and Kit|chen, and commenced a famous Quack; I
que&s;tion whither the mo&s;t eminent of that Profe&s;&s;ion in
<HI>London,</HI> which I take to be <HI>R&mdash;k,</HI> ever tried more
&s;alutary Methods to de&s;troy the human Species, than this profound
<HI>E&s;culapius</HI> had done, nor with more Succe&s;s; whom we &s;hall 
<PB N="232" REF="255"> hereafter di&s;tingui&s;h by the Title of Doctor
<HI>Sheil.</HI></P>
<P>This Wretch, who was ignorant be|yond Conception, was a Compound
of Pragmataci&s;m and Hypocri&s;y, his Eyes were eternally bent to Heaven, with
the mo&s;t &s;olemn and au&s;tere A&s;pect, while his Heart was perpetrating
the De&s;truc|tion of all who had the Misfortune to be thrown into his
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;tance which convinced me of it, was this; the
light Guineas were now cried down, &s;o that People would &s;carcely accept
them on any Account. This Doctor was very particular every <HI>Saturday</HI> to
call for his Money; being the mo&s;t avaricious Mortal I had &s;een. It
happened one Evening, that we had no Money in the Hou&s;e but the&s;e Gui|neas,
one of which was very remarkable and wanted Six Shillings. This I gave him, and
allowed him the Deficiency. In a few Days after, every light Guinea which my
Mother had, &s;he &s;old, and took current Guineas for them. She had exactly
five Weight ones in her Pur&s;e. <PB N="233" REF="256"> One Morning that I went
out, &s;he left her Pocket hanging on a Chair; as &s;he was never
&s;u&s;picious of any one. When I returned, &s;he was going to &s;end me to pay
&s;ome Ca&s;h; when what &s;hould I &s;ee but the light Guinea I had &s;ome
Days before given <HI>Sheil.</HI> The Thing a&s;toni&s;hed me; I a&s;ked if
<HI>Sheil</HI> had been in the Room, &s;he &s;aid no, nor any Per&s;on
be|&s;ides Nur&s;e; this Nur&s;e, under the Ro&s;e, was much addicted to
Liquor, I called her, and examined her clo&s;ely about the Matter, &s;he
&s;trenuou&s;ly denied her know|ing any thing of it; at length, by Threats and
Entreaties, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that <HI>Sheil</HI> had given her Half a Pint
of Rum to change them in her Pocket, he a&s;&s;uring her it was the &s;ame
Thing.</P>
<P>I now be&s;ought my Mother's Permi&s;|&s;ion to lay the old
canting R&mdash;l in Newgate, but &s;he begged, that I would let her die in
Peace, and not cau&s;e her la&s;t Moments to be di&s;turbed with Contention;
&s;he farther conjured me not to mention it till &s;he was either dead, or in
&s;ome <PB N="234" REF="257"> other Lodging. In Compliance to her Reque&s;t, I
dropt the Affair.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding her De&s;ire of Quietne&s;s, this
Blood-hound, for &s;uch alone I can &s;tile him, re&s;olved to ha&s;ten her
Exit; for the next Day watching his Opportunity, when I was out, he came up,
and with an au&s;tere Countenance demanded three Weeks Rent, which was that Day
due to him, &s;he told him in a faint Voice, that I was gone for Money, and
would pay him at my Return; but he &s;wore he would not be trifled with any
longer; and if &s;he did not in&s;tantly pay him, he would turn her into the
Street.</P>
<P>Imagine what a Shock this Behaviour mu&s;t be to one in her feeble
Condition; &s;he could make no An&s;wer, but bur&s;t into Tears. Come, Madam,
&s;aid the inhuman Cannibal, the&s;e Arts won't pa&s;s on me; give me either my
Money, or Value for it, or by G&mdash;d you &s;hall go out of this Lodging.</P>
<P>She gave him the Keys of her Draw|ers, and de&s;ired him to take
any Move|ables <PB N="235" REF="258"> he thought proper for his Security, and
intreated for Chri&s;tian Charity he would leave the Room, as his Pre&s;ence
was baneful to her.</P>
<P>This was all he aimed at, &s;o ve|ry mode&s;tly helped him&s;elf
to every Thing that was valuable, and left the Room.</P>
<P>I returned &s;oon after, and was greatly &s;urprized, to &s;ee my
poor Mother trembling, and pale, &s;o that &s;he &s;carce &s;eemed to live;
&s;he faintly looked up at me, and &s;aid my dear Child, that Villain
<HI>Sheil</HI> has been the Death of your Mother; I knew I had not long to
exi&s;t, but &s;ure it was cruel to &s;tab at Half an Hour of my frail
Life.</P>
<P>I could &s;carce contain the various Pa&s;|&s;ions ri&s;ing in my
Brea&s;t; Love, Pity, Horror, and Re&s;entment, reciprocally took Place, and I
&s;hould doubtle&s;s have gone and taken his Life, but that filial Duty
withheld me from adding to my dear Mother's Affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="259">I prevailed on her to take a little mull'd
Wine, after which &s;he went to Bed; and I found on the Table the&s;e Lines,
which were the la&s;t &s;he ever wrote; 
<Q> 
<L>My Lord, my Saviour, and my God,</L> 
<L>I bow to thy correcting Rod;</L> 
<L>Nor will I murmur or complain,</L> 
<L>Tho' ev'ry Limb be fill'd with Pain;</L> 
<L>Tho' my weak Tongue its Aid denies,</L> 
<L>And Day-light wounds my wretched Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;at up with her all this Night, during which &s;he &s;lept
little for the heavy Cough on her Lungs; but &s;he retained her Sen&s;es &s;o
well, that &s;he entertained me with many Stories, and repeated Part of a Poem
written on Mrs. <HI>Waller.</HI> I believe, Ma|dam, &s;aid I, &s;he's a
Sub&s;criber to you; Yes, &s;aid &s;he, &s;he paid the Money to my Father. I
now found her Brain begin to grow defective; which gave the mo&s;t piercing
Angui&s;h to my Heart I had ever received.</P>
<P>She doz'd a little about four o'Clock in the Morning; and when
&s;he awoke, <PB N="237" REF="260"> told me, &s;he had a mighty agreeable
Dream; which was, that her Father came to her in a Mourning Coach and Six; and
told her he was very angry &s;he had been &s;o long ill, and yet never &s;ent
for him whom &s;he knew was always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t her: I am come,
continued he, to bring you out of all your Troubles; and with that, took her in
his Arms, like a Child, and carried her away in the Coach.</P>
<P>My boding Heart readily interpreted this Dream, as indeed did her
own; my Dear, &s;aid &s;he, you know the U&s;age I have received from your
Father, together with the Knowledge I have that there are but few good
Clergymen to be found, have ever made me declare that I would permit none of
them to vi&s;it me in my la&s;t Hours, except dear Doctor <HI>Delany:</HI>
However, &s;ince he is from Town, and the World would add Impiety to all they
have &s;aid of me, if I don't have &s;ome one of them, pray &s;end for the
Cu|rate of this Pari&s;h; I accordingly did, and we all joined in Prayer; after
which &s;he fell into a good deal of Di&s;cour&s;e with <PB N="238" REF="261">
him, and they drank a Gla&s;s of Wine to|gether: He a&s;ked her if &s;he
forgave my Father; and &s;he related the following Story to him.</P>
<P>There was an hone&s;t <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;t, on his Death-bed,
and when the Prie&s;t was going to give him Ab&s;olution, he a&s;ked the &s;ick
Man, If he freely forgave all his Enemies? Otherwi&s;e he could not
admi|ni&s;ter that Sacrament to him; the Man replied, Arah faith, Father, I do
forgive every one, only <HI>Teddy Brenan,</HI> that poun|ded my Cow. Nay, but,
&s;aid the Prie&s;t, you mu&s;t forgive him al&s;o, or I cannot ab&s;olve you;
Well, &s;aid he, Father, if I die, I will forgive him; but if I live, I never
can. Will that do, &s;aid the &s;ick Man? Arah faith, &s;aid the Prie&s;t, if
it won't do, it mu&s;t do; and accordingly proceeded.</P>
<P>So, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, if I die I do forgive him; and I wi&s;h the
God whom he has offended may do the &s;ame; but if I live, mark you that,
Ma&s;ter Par&s;on, I never will.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="262">The Clergyman departed, and in about an
Hour's time came a great long Letter, written, I &s;uppo&s;e, at the De&s;ire
of Doctor <HI>Sheil,</HI> by &s;ome of the enthu&s;ia&s;tical Me|thodi&s;ts, of
which <HI>Dublin</HI> is now the chief Receptacle in his Maje&s;ty's
Domi|nions; it was written in their whining Stile, declaring that &s;he, my
Mother, was damned beyond Redemption; that &s;he was now on the Brink of Hell;
and that not the Blood of the Lamb could inter|cept her.</P>
<P>We both laughed at this fanta&s;tic Con|trivance, and &s;he only
wi&s;hed for Strength to be able to an&s;wer it properly; but alas, that &s;he
never had.</P>
<P>This Day &s;he retained her Sen&s;es to|lerably till Evening, when
&s;he began to talk incoherently. I &s;at up till Four in the Morning, at which
time I grew very heavy: What, &s;aid &s;he, can't you watch and pray a Moment,
till this bitter Cup pa&s;&s;es from me; a Moment, and I &s;hall be no more:
Come, &s;aid &s;he, kneel down, and take my Ble&s;&s;ing, and the la&s;t Adieu.
With a Heart rent in twain, I complied, <PB N="240" REF="263"> and &s;he laid
her Hand on my Head, and &s;aid, very devoutly, the God of <HI>Abra|ham,
I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> ble&s;s you; the Father, the Son, and Holy
Gho&s;t, pro|tect and guard you, and bring you &s;afe to everla&s;ting Peace,
where I go a little before you; for, &s;urely, my dear Child, I believe,
through Chri&s;t, I &s;hall be happy hereafter.</P>
<P>The Words made &s;o deep an Impre&s;|&s;ion on my Soul, that I
could not help repeating them; and I do it more par|ticularly, becau&s;e &s;ome
People have been cruel enough to &s;ay, &s;he died an Athei&s;t; but &s;urely
ev'ry Per&s;on, who examines her Writings, will find that &s;he was a
&s;in|cere Believer in the Doctrines of Chri&s;t|ianity, as taught by the
Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>; the perpetual Benefit of which I hope &s;he now
enjoys. I remember in the Beginning of her Illne&s;s, &s;he called me to her;
and &s;aid, I have a thing to reque&s;t, and you mu&s;t by no means deny me,
but promi&s;e on your Life, your Honour, and your Soul, to perform it; I told
her, as I had not often di&s;obeyed her, &s;he need <PB N="241" REF="264"> not
be &s;o particular in charging me; 'tis this, &s;aid &s;he, in a few Days
you'll lo&s;e your poor little Mother; and as you know I have no Money, your
Father un|doubtedly will bury me, and, perhaps, may propo&s;e putting my
Remains in his Family Burial Place; but if you &s;uffer that, you have my heavy
Cur&s;e; nay, if it's po&s;&s;ible, I will come from the Grave to re&s;ent it.
Lay me by my dear Father, and let our kindred A&s;hes mingle toge|ther; for,
were I put in the Ground with your Father,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She and her

<L>And the dividing Flames burn diffe|rent Ways.</L></Q> The&s;e
were her very Words: Now, &s;aid &s;he, if ever you grow rich, erect a little
&s;quare Marble Stone over me; and let this In&s;cription be on it; 
<Q><HI>Here lyeth, near the Body of her ho|noured Father,</HI> John
Vanlewen, <HI>M. D. the Mortal Part of</HI><LB><HI>Mrs.</HI> LAETITIA
PILKINGTON,<LB><PB N="242" REF="265"> <HI>Who&s;e Spirit hopes for that Peace,
thro' the infinite Merit of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which a cruel and mercile&s;s
World never afforded her.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I &s;incerely promi&s;ed to obey her In|junction. But to
return:&mdash;Between Five and Six her Breath grew &s;hort, and her Eye-Sight
failed her, I went, and em|bracing her Hand, which was now almo&s;t lifele&s;s,
a&s;ked her if &s;he knew me: Yes, &s;aid &s;he, you are my elde&s;t Son, come
from the College for my Ble&s;&s;ing; you might have called before, but God
ble&s;s you. It &s;eemed as if her not being per|mitted to &s;ee him
di&s;turbed her la&s;t Mo|ments. She then de&s;ired me to kneel down and pray
by her, which I did, &s;till keeping her Hand in mine, I found it grow cold,
and heavy, and looking up ju&s;t &s;aw her expire with a Sigh.</P>
<P>I now beheld the mo&s;t tender and en|dearing Mother departed from
me: My only Prop and Succour gone: While I &s;aw my&s;elf ready to be expo&s;ed
to all the Malice of Fortune. I too well before ex|perienced the obdurate
Temper of my <PB N="243" REF="266"> Father, to hope any Favour from him.
However, &s;ummoning up all my Phi|lo&s;ophy, and repo&s;ing my intire
Confi|dence in divine Providence, I left that Scene of Sorrow and Lamentation,
and retired to take a little Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome few Days before this &s;e|cured all my Mother's
Manu&s;cripts in the Hands of a Friend, which was very fortunate for me,
&s;ince the Moment old <HI>Sheil</HI> heard &s;he was dead, he ran into the
Dining-Room, and &s;ecured every Thing he could lay Hands on; after which he
went to inform my Father of the long wi&s;hed and joyful News. He could
&s;carce credit it at fir&s;t; but when the pious Mr. <HI>Sheil</HI>
a&s;&s;ured him on the Word of a Chri&s;tian, that he &s;poke Truth, my Father,
with great Compo&s;ure, &s;aid it had been well for her, to have died &s;ome
Years ago; old <HI>Sheil</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, that he believed &s;he would not
have died this Bout, but for the Fright he gave her in her Sickne&s;s; for
which kind Office my Father could not but thank him.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="267">He gave immediate Orders for her Funeral,
which you may depend on it was not profu&s;e; he allowed her, how|ever a decent
Oak Coffin and Shrowd, and the Nur&s;e-keeper told me, that <HI>Sheil</HI> was
&s;o unparalleled a Wretch, that &s;he could &s;carce keep him out of the Room
while &s;he &s;tripped the Corp&s;e, which the Moment &s;he had done, and put
her Shrowd on, he came and took the Linen in which &s;he died, and &s;ecured
that al&s;o.</P>
<P>When I aro&s;e in the Morning, the old Hypocrite a&s;ked me to
Breakfa&s;t with him, and endeavoured to comfort me, by &s;aying my Father was
too good a Chri&s;tian to let me want; and that as the Cau&s;e of his Anger to
me was now removed, by the Death of my Mother, the Effect would undoubtedly
cea&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him I expected nothing from him, nor &s;hould I, tho'
infinitely di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed, make any Application to him; that Nature
in&s;tructed me to love and protect my Mother, who&s;e Cau&s;e my Duty prompted
me to e&s;pou&s;e, of which <PB N="245" REF="268"> I could not be a&s;hamed,
&s;ince I would do it, were it to be done again.</P>
<P>He &s;aid I ought to &s;ubmit to my Fa|ther, and write to him;
and, &s;aid he, tho&s;e Papers and Letters you have, &s;end them to him, which
will prove your Re&s;pect, and I will engage to me|diate Matters &s;o well
between you, that he &s;hall allow you Twenty Pounds a Year, tho' he won't
&s;ee you.</P>
<P>As I am too apt to be credulous, had any Per&s;on, but this Man,
whom my Soul abhorred, made &s;uch Overtures, I &s;hould have thought there was
&s;omething in it; but if the Harmony of Angels proceeded from his Lips, whom I
looked on as the Murderer of my dear Mother, it would to me be hateful as the
Hi&s;&s;ing of Serpents.</P>
<P>However, I li&s;tened to him, and an|&s;wered that tho&s;e Papers
would certainly obtain Money for me, and Promi&s;es were often broke; that as
to Twenty Pounds a Year, my Father would as &s;oon give Twenty of his Teeth;
but if the officious Mr. <HI>Sheil</HI> would prevail <PB N="246" REF="269"> on
my Father to give me Fifty Pounds, I would not only re&s;ign them, but would go
to &s;ome Part of the World, where he &s;hould never hear of me.</P>
<P>The latter Part of this my Father would readily agree to, nay have
given me his Ble&s;&s;ing at my Departure, <HI>but not a Word of the Nine and
Forty Pieces.</HI> Indeed another <HI>pious Divine</HI> offered me a Sum of
Money to go to <HI>America,</HI> which becau&s;e I did not con&s;ent to, he has
&s;ince utterly rejected me; but a little Time will &s;hew the World his
Motives for that, and open a very <HI>unexpected Scene to the Publick</HI>; and
tho' I have not kept my Promi&s;e to him in making the Affair known before now,
yet I take this Op|portunity of informing his Reverence that I have not forgot
him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Doctor (<HI>Sheil</HI> I mean) went to my Father,
and told my Con|ditions; but he only laughed, and &s;aid I had not my Mother's
Genius, and mu&s;t quickly fall into Contempt, there|fore he very fairly &s;et
me at Defiance; and &s;hould I dare to print any Thing <PB N="247" REF="270">
again&s;t him, he had Intere&s;t enough to &s;end me over the Water. I am
&s;orry for the di&s;agreeable Nece&s;&s;ity I am under of &s;peaking or
writing any Thing to di&s;plea&s;e him, but Facts may be related, I hope,
without Offence.</P>
<P>The next Day Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> in&s;erted the following
Paragraph in his Paper.</P>
<P><HI>Ye&s;terday Morning died Mrs.</HI> Letitia Pilkington. And the
Author of <HI>Pue's Oc|currences,</HI> one of the wor&s;t Papers pub|li&s;hed
there, (I &s;uppo&s;e by my Father's Direction) in&s;erted a very fal&s;e and
&s;can|dalous Paragraph; while Mr. <HI>E&s;dall,</HI> who is a Gentleman of
known Worth and In|tegrity publi&s;hed a genteel Encomium on her.</P>
<P>A few Days after I wrote the following little Piece, which, as it
was almo&s;t my fir&s;t Attempt in Rhyme, and on &s;o par|ticular a Subject, I
hope the Readers will pardon me for introducing it here. 
<Q> <PB N="248" REF="271">

<L>What dreadful Angui&s;h preys upon his Mind,</L>
<L>That thou art fled, and he remains be|hind:</L>
<L>Pleas'd if with you he might a&s;cend the Sky,</L>
<L>To the bright Regions of Felicity;</L>
<L>But here no Joy, no Comfort, no De|light,</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>I never communicated the&s;e Lines to any one; and now
tran&s;cribe them only from my Memory.</P>
<P>Since, by writing this little Account, I have obtained the Honour
of &s;peaking to the Public, it gives me an Opportu|nity of &s;aying
&s;omething in Favour of my|&s;elf, who I am convinced have been
mi&s;|repre&s;ented to them, and for which, I hope, I &s;hall be excu&s;ed, as
Self-pre&s;er|vation is the fir&s;t Law of Nature. There are many Per&s;ons of
&s;ome Note in Life, who have, on hearing me mentioned, cried, Oh, horrid Dog,
&s;hocking Fellow, &amp;c. Pray, Gentlemen and Ladies, for 
<PB N="251" REF="274"> what? Where are my Accu&s;ers; let them name the
particular Crimes for which I de&s;erve tho&s;e Epithets, or el&s;e not
men|tion me at all.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> I think, is the only In&s;tance which
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes us with, of a Per&s;on being condemn'd
for accumulated Trea&s;on; nay, even he had a fair Hearing for his Life: But
the&s;e People are for condemning me unheard, for no particular Fault, only
that &s;uch and &s;uch People &s;ay &s;o and &s;o.</P>
<P>A Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this has made me re&s;olve to write my
own Life, by which means only I &s;hall have a Power of &s;etting Things in a
clear Light, and of adju&s;ting many pre&s;ent Ambiguities; and, though I
confe&s;s the Public are bur|thened with Things of this kind already, many of
which have no Tendency to re|form the Manners of the Age, but rather vitiate
them; yet I flatter my&s;elf, among the Variety of real Incidents, and
whim&s;ical Revolutions I have met with, they may find as well Entertainment,
as Matter, to moralize on.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="275">As I do by no means a&s;&s;ume the Name of a
Writer, &s;o the Public may be a&s;|&s;ured I &s;hall never attempt Satyr; if
my Betters have Faults, that's no Affair of mine; I am to pur&s;ue my own
Story. A Man who can't put up with a Tweak by the No&s;e, and a Foot in the
Rump, is not fit to live in this fa&s;hionable World; I therefore a&s;&s;ure
the Public, before hand, that I will be quite pa&s;&s;ive; and tho' I name the
Error, not the Man; by which man|ner of Proceeding, 'tis not improbable that by
the time I am four&s;core, I may have an Annuity of forty Pounds a Year; upon
the Hopes of which I may rea&s;o|nably &s;ub&s;i&s;t and keep up my Spirits.
And in this I &s;trictly follow the Advice of a certain great Man in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e Place of Abode is not remote from the
<HI>Phenix-Park</HI>; and who&s;e Acquirements have ju&s;tly rai&s;ed him from
Ob&s;curity to Opulence; his exten&s;ive Plans in Build|ing have excited an
univer&s;al Admiration of his Ta&s;te in Architecture. This worthy Per&s;on I
applied to, after the Death of my Mother; and informed him, that I 
<PB N="253" REF="276"> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome Letters, which he had in
her Life-time been plea&s;ed to ho|nour her with; and that as her Papers would,
undoubtedly, fall into the Hands of a Printer, I thought proper, le&s;t the
Publication of them might be offen&s;ive to him, to give him this
Information.</P>
<P>He &s;ent his Compliments by the Me&s;|&s;enger, and de&s;ired to
&s;ee me the next Morning; I accordingly waited on him; and tho' my
Circum&s;tances were not in the flow, yet, in order to convince him that I had
no lucrative Motive in addre&s;|&s;ing him, I put the Letters under a Cover,
and &s;ent them in before me.</P>
<P>I was then introduced to his Pre&s;ence; he received me with the
utmo&s;t good Manners, de&s;iring me to &s;it: Young Man, &s;aid he, I have had
a Letter from you lately, concerning &s;ome Writings of mine to your Mother;
&s;he was a Lady whom I regarded, on account of her Fa|ther and Family, whom I
well knew; and therefore I corre&s;ponded with, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, my
Letters you have here &s;ent me; and, young Man, I'll <PB N="254" REF="277">
keep them; and will give you a Piece of Advice better than Gold, if you'll
follow it.</P>
<P>There has been lately at my Hou&s;e his G&mdash;ce the P&mdash;te
*****, and &s;everal other Per&s;ons of the mo&s;t eminent Stations in this
Kingdom, and di&s;cour|&s;ing of your Mother's Writings, intro|duced you; and
it was &s;aid, that you had taken the Liberty to write to &s;everal great Men,
very much in the Stile of your Mother; they imagined, when &s;he was dead, they
&s;hould have heard no more of the Matter; but you &s;eem'd to keep her Spirit
alive. Now, young Man, &s;aid he, con&s;ider you are not a Woman, from whom
ev'n a Blow cannot hurt Ho|nour: We tollerated tho&s;e Things in her, which, in
you, would be culpable in the highe&s;t degree; in &s;hort, if you have any
Talents, as I am told you have, apply them to make Friends, in&s;tead of
troubling your Head about the Follies of Mankind; find out their Virtues, and
make that your Theme. Indeed, Sir, that, &s;aid I, will be a difficult Matter. 
<PB N="255" REF="278"> In &s;hort, Sir, continued he, if you do not apply your
Genius, according to the Will of your Superiors, Care will be taken to &s;end
you out of the Kingdom before you are aware of it.</P>
<P>I thanked him &s;incerely for his Admo|nition, which I determined
from that Mo|ment to e&s;tabli&s;h as my Principle; and, on my Return thro' the
Park, upon ex|amining the Affair, found it more ratio|nal to &s;uppo&s;e, that
I &s;hould live by writ|ing Panygeric than Satyr, I re&s;olved to try the
Experiment, and, at the &s;ame time, determined to be&s;tow random Prai&s;e, no
matter to me tho' the Per&s;on I addre&s;&s;ed was tainted with the mo&s;t
diabolical Vices, I was to form the &s;uppo&s;ed Vir|tues and Graces from my
own copious Idea. The fir&s;t I exerted my Talent on, was the <HI>Son of a
Ba&s;haw,</HI> then re&s;ident in the&s;e <HI>Dominions</HI>; and one who&s;e
<HI>wi&s;e Interpo&s;ition</HI> in the <HI>S&mdash;te</HI> Matters of that
<HI>Kingdom,</HI> have made him &s;o much the Darling of the <HI>grateful</HI>
People, and &s;o far rai&s;ed Envy on this Side the Wa|ter, that on his Return,
in&s;tead of Ac|clamations <PB N="256" REF="279"> he is acco&s;ted with Sneers
and Hi&s;&s;es, where-ever he appears; while he, con&s;cious of his innate
Worth, &s;heds a contemptuous Smile on the &s;en&s;e|le&s;s Idiots, who are
weak enough to cen|&s;ure his &s;uperior Abilities.</P>
<P>I remembered to have heard him re|ceive the Applau&s;e of the
Senate-hou&s;e, for telling Mr. S&mdash;r, that as the Sea|&s;on was far
advanced, and the Gentlemen de&s;irous of returning to their Seats, he thought
it be&s;t to p&mdash;ge the P&mdash;t till <HI>April</HI> en&s;uing.</P>
<P>This &s;ublime Piece of Elocution was Matter enough for me, who,
from my pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem, you'll allow was a pro|fe&s;s'd Sycophant; I
accordingly wrote &s;ome Lines on the Occa&s;ion, which were not of
Con&s;equence enough to &s;ub&s;i&s;t till this time; therefore cannot be here
re|cited. I waited on his L&mdash;p, and put them into his Hand as he &s;tept
into his Chariot; he received them, and drove off; the next Morning I waited at
the &s;ame Place, till he was going out, and had the Honour of a gracious
Smile; <PB N="257" REF="280"> upon which, I liv'd elegantly that Day. The
&s;ucceeding Morning I receiv'd, What? a familiar Nod! Upon which I
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted tollerably, till five that After|noon. At that Time indeed,
&s;ome extra|ordinary Emotion in my Stomach, gave me to under&s;tand, that Nods
and Smiles though conferr'd by the Sons of Ba&s;haws, will not fill the
Belly.</P>
<P>The indifferent Succe&s;s of my fir&s;t En|terprize made me
almo&s;t determine, never to attempt any Thing more in that Way; though an
Affair of like Nature, which happened &s;ome Time before, might, if I had
common Sen&s;e, have been &s;ufficient to deter me.</P>
<P>As I was walking one Day, pen&s;ive and pennyle&s;s through
<HI>Henry-&s;treet,</HI> I &s;aw &s;ome Footmen and Chairmen with White Gloves
and Cockades; and on en|quiring the Occa&s;ion, was told that L&mdash;d
<HI>H&mdash;th,</HI> was that Day married to Mi&s;s <HI>K&mdash;g</HI>; I
immediately ran to a Coffee-Hou&s;e, call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote
a flaming Epithalamium, which I as &s;uddenly di&s;patch'd, re&s;olving to 
<PB N="258" REF="281"> have the Start of all <HI>Grub-&s;treet.</HI> His
L&mdash;d&s;hip came out and told the Me&s;|&s;enger, that when Mr.
<HI>Pilkington</HI> wrote better Ver&s;es, he would &s;end him a Re|ward.</P>
<P>I was at this Time in a Window op|po&s;ite to his Lord&s;hip, who
&s;aw the Man come over and deliver me the An&s;wer; I took a Pen, and before
his Face, wrote Extempore the following Truth: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<HEAD>To the Right Hon. the Lord <HI>H&mdash;th.</HI></HEAD>
<L>In a Coffee-Hou&s;e hurried, and pre&s;t by my Fate,</L>
<L>I wrote a few Lines to get &s;omething to eat;</L>
<L>Perhaps, though the Subject, a Dunce might in&s;pire,</L>
<L>The want of Sub&s;i&s;tence has &s;lackened my Fire;</L>
<L>But if your kind Lord&s;hip, that Want will &s;upply,</L>

<P><PB N="259" REF="282">His Lord&s;hip &s;ent Word it was very well:
It may be &s;o, thought I, but Faith I found it very ill.</P>
<P>I could not avoid repeating the Story, in &s;ome Companies I after
fell into, and whether they re&s;ented the Reception I met, or had &s;ome
former Pique to that N&mdash;n, I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay, but &s;hortly

<P>As this is the fir&s;t Time I have been ble&s;&s;ed with an

me, &s;ince I find I have no Means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, but by a &s;mall
Smattering of Wit, which is &s;ome|how inherent to me, to which I do a&s;&s;ure
the Readers, nothing but Nece&s;&s;ity could make me have Recour&s;e. I too
well know, that the greate&s;t Genius's in that Way, have been &s;carce able to
keep a Coat to their Backs; therefore if &s;ome generous, noble, or humane
Per&s;on, would be&s;tow on me a &s;mall Annuity, which might barely &s;et me
above Want, I would re&s;ign all Preten&s;ions to the Pen, into the Hands of
tho&s;e, who by Educa|tion, and native Endowments, are better qualified to
u&s;e it. Some Per&s;ons of Rank who are inclined to banter, tell me they would
by no Means deprive the World of their Entertainment, by giving me a
Provi&s;ion; but if they will plea&s;e to con|&s;ider, that one
lei&s;ure-well-fini&s;hed Line, is of more Importance, than Volumes 
<PB N="264" REF="287"> written in a Hurry, they will be of another Mind. If the
great Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ea&s;y affluent
For|tune, his Works, which are now almo&s;t buried in Oblivion, would have been
had in much greater E&s;teem than they are; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to
think, but a Per&s;on of &s;o exten&s;ive a Capacity, mu&s;t at one Time or
other have produced &s;omething excellent.</P>
<P>And &s;ince I have &s;aid &s;o much, one Thing more, Truth,
Gratitude, and Ho|nour, compels me to &s;ay, which is in re|lation to Mr.
<HI>James Wor&s;dale,</HI> &s;o often mentioned in the&s;e Memoirs. I'm &s;orry
I'm oblig'd to confe&s;s, that I think my Mother carried her Re&s;entment too
far, in de&s;cribing the Character of this Gen|tleman; but all Per&s;ons who
have any &s;uperior Qualification, have generally &s;ome Imperfection adequate
to it, which is done by Providence, to &s;hew us, that none are perfect on
Earth. Thus we &s;ee, an <HI>Apollo</HI> in Mu&s;ick, a Swine in his Ap|petite:
Thus <HI>Swift,</HI> unrival'd in Wit, was a Slave to Peevi&s;hne&s;s and ill
Tem|per, <PB N="265" REF="288"> which ob&s;cur'd his Merit, in the mo&s;t
&s;ocial Hour; and my Mother, who po&s;&s;e&s;t a pretty Manner of Writing, was
apt to fall too hard, on tho&s;e whom &s;he imagined her&s;elf injured by.</P>
<P>However, I'm convinced Mr <HI>Wor&s;|dale</HI> never did, nor
intended Injury to her, or any other Per&s;on, as he is good-natur'd to a
Fault, and as he has &s;aid him&s;elf, 
<Q> 
<L>Anxious to gain, but not to keep his Pelf,</L> 
<L>A Friend to ev'ry Creature but him|&s;elf.</L></Q> And this is
a Truth that I can a&s;&s;ert, having liv'd &s;ome Years in his Hou&s;e, which
was truly ho&s;pitable to every in|digent Per&s;on that fell in his Knowledge,
but particularly &s;uch as had any Preten|&s;ions to Merit.</P>
<P>What my Mother has &s;aid of him proceeded from &s;ome little
Pique, and therefore I hope People who read it, will only laugh at her Humour,
but not &s;eri|ou&s;ly <PB N="266" REF="289"> reflect on it, to the
Di&s;advantage of a Per&s;on, who is incapable of acting, but with Honour,
Ju&s;tice, and Integri|ty, which will be more fully in my Power to
demon&s;trate, in the little Account I intend to give of my own Life.</P>
<P>And though it would exceed the &s;mall Limits I am pre&s;crib'd,
to apologize to every particular Per&s;on, pointed at in this Volume, yet I
hope they will be hu|mane enough, to harbour no Re&s;entment again&s;t me, for
any Thing it contains, &s;ince I have before &s;pecified the Nece&s;&s;ity I
was under of publi&s;hing it; and as many Characters are there, of which I am
really ignorant; &s;o it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to break in upon the
Connection of one Part with another, by making Al|terations, or leaving any
Part out.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome Per&s;ons, whom my Mother was highly obliged to,
and to whom, had &s;he lived to compleat this Work, &s;he would have returned
her Ac|knowledgments publickly; one of them was the Earl of
<HI>Clanrickarde,</HI> a Noble|man <PB N="267" REF="290"> of mo&s;t
illu&s;trious De&s;cent, and one who con&s;picuou&s;ly retains the united
Vir|tues of his Ance&s;tors. My Mother hav|ing wrote his Lord&s;hip a Letter
for a Sub&s;cription, he &s;ent her in Return a mo&s;t polite Epi&s;tle, which
I have now the Honour to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in which his Lord|&s;hip promi&s;ed
&s;hortly to favour her with a Vi&s;it, and in &s;ome Time he came. After
having &s;at about half an Hour chatting, he told her, he had promi&s;ed to
&s;ub&s;cribe to her Works, but that he imagined a Poem in her Prai&s;e,
written by him&s;elf, would be of infinitely more Service to her; upon which he
de|livered her a Sheet of Paper, and &s;he really believing him &s;erious, was
about to open it. Pardon me, Madam, &s;aid my Lord, you mu&s;t not read my
Ver&s;es while I am pre&s;ent, or you'll offend my Mode&s;ty. She laid the
Paper down, and &s;hortly after my Lord took has Leave. When &s;he
opened it, &s;he found a Draft on <HI>Dillon</HI> and Company for twenty
Pounds. I hope I &s;hall obtain his Lord|&s;hip's Forgivene&s;s for the Freedom
I <PB N="268" REF="291"> here take of mentioning his Name; but I think &s;uch
Actions, and &s;uch alone compo&s;e his Life, ought not to be ob|&s;cured; and
tho' doubtle&s;s this is but a trivial In&s;tance of the Munificence and Honour
of that worthy Nobleman, yet as my Mother was an intire Stranger, and that his
Lord&s;hip did it purely in Compa&s;&s;ion to her Sufferings and Regard to her
Talents, &s;he ever e&s;teemed both the Gift, and the Manner it was given in,
as the genteele&s;t Thing that could po&s;&s;ibly be done: and as &s;he did not
&s;ur|vive to &s;peak her Sentiments on that Oc|ca&s;ion, I hope I &s;hall be
pardoned for attempting it.</P>
