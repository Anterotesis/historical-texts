<P>IT is pre&s;umed that the following &s;election will be found extremely u&s;eful to Readers of almo&s;t every cla&s;s:&mdash;To the youthful, as it contains the choice&s;t flowers of fancy, which cannot fail to warm and refine the imagi|nation:&mdash;To the State&s;man, Philo&s;opher, &amp;c. as abounding in excellent maxims and re|flections, drawn from exten&s;ive reading, tried and approved by experience and ob&s;ervation:&mdash;To all who a&s;pire to enlarge the &s;phere of their under&s;tanding, but to Engli&s;hmen in particular, as every Briti&s;h &s;ubject is intere&s;ted in &s;ome part of it.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected from Mr. Burke's Pamphlet, entitled,
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
"A Vindication of Natural Society," are not to be taken as conveying Mr. Burke's own opinions, but as an ingenious and artful attack on the principles of Lord Bolingbroke.</P>
<P>A &s;ketch of Mr. Burke's Life, with &s;ome original anecdotes, is prefixed, for which the Author entreats the indulgence of the Public, as it is the fir&s;t attempt of a trembling pen in the biographic line.</P>
<P>A copious index is added, to &s;upply any defects in the arrangement of the different articles, as it was very difficult, amid&s;t &s;uch a variety, to place every one under its proper head.</P>

<HEAD>A SKETCH of the LIFE, WITH SOME ORIGINAL ANECDOTES OF Mr. BURKE.</HEAD>
<P>THE gentleman, who &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the following &s;election, conceived that it would be acceptable to prefix &s;ome anecdotes of the author. If time, talent, and the nature of the work admitted, it would, in many re&s;pects, be a plea&s;ing ta&s;k to trace this extraordinary man through all the mazes of his politics, to attend him in &s;tudious retirement, to mark the bolde&s;t flights of his imagination, to fathom a mind, rich and profound as the ocean, and as ea&s;ily agitated by every gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and tornado of re&s;entment.&mdash;Mr. Burke was called into action in the mo&s;t eventful period that ever enriched the page of hi&s;tory. His voice was early rai&s;ed in favour of liberty in America. The blazing &s;uns of India have been often lo&s;t in the &s;plendour of his eloquence. The fable children of Africa have numbered him in the li&s;t of their advocates, and almo&s;t every &s;tate in Europe has, at one time or other, been the &s;ubject of his tongue and his pen.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke was fir&s;t taught to read by his mother, a woman of excellent under&s;tanding, and a highly cultivated mind. He was in&s;tructed in writing and accounts by Mr. James Fitzgerald, who kept a day-&s;chool
<PB N="ii" REF="6">
near Smithfield, Dublin. At the age of twelve he was committed to the care of Mr. Abraham Shackelton, a Quaker, ma&s;ter of an eminent cla&s;&s;ical academy in Balitore, in the County of Kildare. That the reader may form &s;ome idea of his pre|ceptor, and the &s;eminary, we tran&s;cribe the following adverti&s;ement, which appeared in the public prints about that time:</P>

<HEAD>BALITORE BOARDING-SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>Abraham Shackelton informs his friends and the public, that being placed guardian over the mo|rals of the youth under his care, he declines, from con&s;cientious motives, to teach that part of the aca|demic cour&s;e, which he conceives injurious to mo|rals, and &s;ubver&s;ive of &s;ound principles, particularly tho&s;e authors, who recommend in &s;educing language, the illu&s;ions of love, and the abominable trade of war. Tho&s;e who de&s;ign their &s;ons for the college, will take their mea&s;ures accordingly. He profe&s;&s;es to fit youth for bu&s;ine&s;s, and in&s;truct them in polite literature. His terms are &s;ix pounds per quarter&mdash;no entrance money demanded.</P>

<P>Mr. Shackelton was a man of fine even temper, &s;evere in his morals, but extremely indulgent to his pupils, with regard to the bent of their genius, which he was &s;tudious to di&s;cover and cultivate&mdash;his maxim was <HI>Natura &s;equitur melius quam ducitur.</HI> Young Burke was very attentive to his &s;tudies&mdash;&s;ometimes at the ex|pence of his health. He did not confine him&s;elf to the Greek and Roman cla&s;&s;ics, he read at intervals &s;ome of the be&s;t Engli&s;h writers, and evinced much ta&s;te in the &s;election of the fine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;many of which he committed to memory. He was pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond of reading Don Bellianis of Greece. This circum&s;tance he mentioned him&s;elf one night in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the debate on the Affairs of Holland in 1786. He al&s;o takes notice of this ro|mance
<PB N="iii" REF="7">
in his E&s;&s;ay on the Sublime and Beautiful. Notwith&s;tanding he appears to have read the poets with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a warm imagination, yet it does not appear that he ever invoked the Mu&s;es. At one time, it is &s;aid, he could repeat all Young's Night Thoughts by rote; in a copy of this work, which he u&s;ed to carry in his pocket, the two following lines in his hand-writing were found &s;ome years &s;ince on a blank leaf.
<Q><L>Jove claim'd the ver&s;e old Homer &s;ung,</L>
<L>But God him&s;elf in&s;pired Young.</L></Q></P>
<P>Several of his wittici&s;ms have been repeated by his &s;choolfellows, but as they are all unworthy of &s;o great a genius, even in bud, we &s;hall pa&s;s them over, with this &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, that the &s;hafts of his wit were not always winged with the feather of a dove. His filial piety was truly exemplary, and his affection for Mr. Shackelton, his ma&s;ter, was evinced on many occa&s;ions. When the good old man vi&s;ited him in London, he received him as a father, intro|duced him to many of his friends, particularly to Mr. Benjamin We&s;t, the painter of po&s;terity, and what is &s;till greater, one of the be&s;t of men. He al&s;o mentioned him with great re&s;pect and veneration in one of his &s;peeches on the Te&s;t Act. Having pa&s;&s;ed a proper time at Balitore Academy, he was tran&s;planted to Trinity College, Dublin, as may appear from the following tran&s;cription from the ad|mi&s;&s;ion book of that univer&s;ity:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"1743, April 14, Edmundus Burke, Pens. filius Johannis Gen. annum agens 16, natus Dublinii, edu|catus &s;ub ferul&acirc; M. Shakelton. Tut. D. Pellifier."</Q></P>
<P>Elected a &s;cholar of the Hou&s;e 26th of May, 1746, commenced A. B. 23d February, 1747-8. He does not appear to have been elected a native.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This term, in the Iri&s;h Univer&s;ity, is applied to a &s;tudent, who, having obtained a &s;cholar&s;hip, is entitled to an annual &s;tipend after a certain &s;tanding.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="8">Doctor M. Kearney, &s;enior Fellow of the Univer|&s;ity, &s;hone as the rival of Mr. Burke, in every cla&s;s of the college cour&s;e. The &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip, how|ever, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and when &s;eparated, they continued to corre&s;pond with each other till within a few weeks of Mr. Burke's di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke's father was an attorney, of &s;ome emi|nence in his profe&s;&s;ion, very highly re&s;pected for the integrity of his character. Having completed his academic &s;tudies, it is &s;aid that he offered him&s;elf as a candidate to fill the moral chair in the Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow, vacant by the death of his countryman Mr. Hutche&s;on. Mr. Reid, however, was rai&s;ed to that &s;ituation, which induced Mr. Burke to turn his attention to the bar. For this purpo&s;e he came to London, and entered his name on the books of the Middle Temple. What a tran&s;ition! he that had d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed the mo&s;t charming &s;ea&s;on of life in culling the faire&s;t flowers of imagination, in tracing the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ing labyrinths of &s;cience, to be obliged to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the midnight oil in po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">g over Coke on Lyt|tleton.

With &s;uch eagerne&s;s did he &s;it down to the&s;e new &s;tudies, that &s;ome|thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> almo&s;t <Q REND="inline">"forgot him&s;elf to &s;tone."</Q> His con&s;titution was not equal to the ta&s;k. His health began to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne; he was advi&s;ed to con&s;ult his friend and countryman, Doctor Nugent, who had pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed many years with great &s;ucce&s;s at Bath. The Doctor was &s;o benevolent a man, that it is &s;aid of him by tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, that if he had the misfortune to lo&s;e a patient, he felt as if he had lo&s;t a child. In addition to this, he was &s;o highly charmed with the conver&s;ation and opening talents of Mr. Burke, that he was re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve them to the world. For this purpo&s;e, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">gned him apartments in his own hou&s;e, where he
<PB N="v" REF="9">
treated him with all the affection of an indulgent parent. Mi&s;s Nugent, the Doctor's only daughter, evinced, by her attention, how deeply &s;he was in|tere&s;ted in the recovery of his health, and what at fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the name of friend&s;hip, changed into that of love. In &s;hort, Mr. Burke was made happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hand that be&s;towed at the &s;ame time one of the gentle&s;t of hearts.</P>
<P>His &s;tudies became more diver&s;ified, and the &s;uc|ce&s;s of &s;ome pens induced him to turn his attention to &s;ome work that might rai&s;e his fame as a writer. His &s;ucce&s;s in this line was equal, nay, &s;uperior to his expectation, but he &s;oon found that <Q REND="inline">"fondne&s;s of fame was avarice of air,"</Q> in con&s;equence of which he procured a letter of introduction to the late Earl of Bath, the Mecaenas of the day. His Lord&s;hip received him with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s, lamented that it was not in his power to render him any &s;er|vice, as he was no longer in power. The impre&s;&s;ion which this unexpected intelligence made on Mr. Burke did not e&s;cape his Lord&s;hip's eye; he felt for the &s;ituation of the young man, and after a pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"I will give you a letter, &s;aid he, to the Earl of Bute, though I don't know that I am entitled to take that liberty."</Q> The propo&s;ition revived Mr. Burke's drooping &s;pirits, and he waited, without lo&s;s of time, on Lord Bute, who profe&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow that it was likewi&s;e out of his power to render him any &s;ervice, as he had re&s;igned all his employments that very morning, adding, that his influence with his Maje&s;ty was greatly over-rated; anxious, however, that a man of genius and talent &s;hould not pine in the &s;hade, he would take one &s;tep, he &s;aid, which he did not know he ought to take, but he would venture, and if crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, it would yield him great plea&s;ure. As Lord Halifax had been appointed to a&s;&s;ume the vice-regal govern|ment of Ireland, perhaps in that &s;ituation, he would be able to render Mr. Burke &s;ome &s;ervice in his native country. The Earl accordingly wrote to
<PB N="vi" REF="10">
Lord Halifax, and recommended the bearer of it as a man of promi&s;ing genius, who would reflect ho|nour on his patronage and protection. The new appointed Viceroy expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t regret that every department in his appointment, except that of private &s;ecretary to his own &s;ecretary was filled up. Mr. Burke was accordingly appointed private &s;ecre|tary to the Right Hon. Gerard Hamilton, commonly called <HI>Single Speech</HI> Hamilton, in con&s;equence of his having made only one &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Commons during all the time that he &s;at in Parlia|ment, but which has ever been con&s;idered as an effort of unprecedented talent, and is thought to have been compo&s;ed by the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P>Having now cur&s;orily traced Mr. Burke to his fir&s;t <HI>debut</HI> on the great theatre of public life (in which it was allowed on all &s;ides that he played his part with great applau&s;e) we &s;hall introduce him in another character, not &s;o &s;plendid, undoubtedly, but &s;till more amiable. Having contracted an early acquaint|ance with a Mr. Michael Smith, a country &s;chool|ma&s;ter, it ripened into mutual friend&s;hip. Several letters pa&s;&s;ed between them; the following is a copy of one which Mr. Burke addre&s;&s;ed to him, &s;oon after his arrival in London. Mr. Smith, it appears, taught the Greek and Roman cla&s;&s;ies at this time in the pari&s;h of Fenagh, in the county of Leitrim.&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MICHAEL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Balf was &s;o very kind as to deliver me your friendly epi&s;tle about half an hour ago. I read it over, ble&s;t the fir&s;t inventor of letters, and as I have plenty of ink, pens, and paper, and as this is one of my holidays, I intend to dedicate it to friend&s;hip.&mdash;Balzac having once e&s;caped from a company, where he found it nece&s;&s;ary to weigh every word that he uttered, chanced to meet a friend, <Q REND="inline">"Come,"</Q> &s;aid he to him, <Q REND="inline">"let us retire to &s;ome place where we can conver&s;e freely together, and commit as many &s;oleci&s;ms as we plea&s;e."</Q> I need not tell you the ap|plication.
<PB N="vii" REF="11">
You'll expect &s;ome &s;hort account of my journey to this great city; to tell you the truth, I made very few remarks as I rolled along, for my mind was occupied with many thoughts, and my eyes often filled with tears when I reflected on all the dear friends I left behind; yet the pro&s;pects could not fail to attract the attention of the mo&s;t indifferent; country &s;eats &s;prinkled round on every &s;ide, &s;ome in the modern ta&s;te, others in the &s;tile of old de Coverley Hall, all &s;miling on the neat, but humble cottage. Every village as gay and compact as a bee|hive, re&s;ounding with the bu&s;y hum of indu&s;try, and inns like palaces. What a contra&s;t between our poor country, where you'll &s;carce find a cottage orna|mented with a chimney. But what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t of all was the progre&s;s of agriculture, my favourite &s;tudy, and my favourite pur&s;uit, if Providence had ble&s;&s;ed me with a few paternal acres. A de&s;cription of London and its nations would fill a volume. The buildings are very fine, it may be called the &s;ink of vice, but her ho&s;pitals and charitable in&s;titu|tions, who&s;e turrets pierce the &s;kies, like &s;o many electrical conductors, avert the very wrath of Hea|ven. The inhabitants may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>undoers</HI> and the <HI>undone,</HI> generally &s;o, I &s;ay, for I am per&s;uaded there are many men of hone&s;ty and women of virtue in every &s;treet. An Engli&s;hman is cold and di&s;tant at fir&s;t; he is very cautious even in forming an acquaintance, he mu&s;t know you well before he enters into friend&s;hip with you, but if he does, he is not the fir&s;t to di&s;&s;olve that &s;acred band; in &s;hort, a real Engli&s;hman is one that performs more than he promi&s;es; in company he is rather &s;ilent, ex|tremely prudent in his expre&s;&s;ions, even in politics, his favourite topic. The women are not quite &s;o re&s;erved; they con&s;ult their gla&s;&s;es to the greate&s;t advantage, and as nature is very liberal in her gifts to their per&s;ons, and even mind, it is not ea&s;y for a young man to e&s;cape their glances, or to &s;hut his
<PB N="viii" REF="12">
ears to their &s;oftly flowing accents. As to the &s;tate of learning in this city, you know I have not been long enough in it to form a proper judgment of that &s;ubject. I don't think, however, there is as much re&s;pect paid to a man of letters on this &s;ide the water as you imagine. I don't find that genius, the <Q REND="inline">"rath primro&s;e, which for&s;aken, dies,"</Q> is patronized by any of the nobility, &s;o that writers of the fir&s;t talents are left to the capricious patronage of the public. Not|with&s;tanding this di&s;couragement, literature is culti|vated in a high degree. Poetry rai&s;es her enchanting voice to Heaven. Hi&s;tory arre&s;ts the wings of time in his &s;light to the gulph of oblivion. Philo&s;ophy, the queen of arts, and the daughter of heaven, is daily extending her intellectual empire. Fancy &s;ports on airy wing like a meteor on the bo&s;om of a &s;ummer cloud, and even Metaphy&s;ics &s;pins her cobwebs and catches &s;ome flies. The Hou&s;e of Commons not unfre|quently exhibits explo&s;ions of eloquence, that ri&s;e &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Greece and Rome, even in their proude&s;t days. Yet after all a man will make more by the figures of arithmetic than by the figures of rhe|toric, unle&s;s he can get into the trade wind, and then he may &s;ail &s;ecure over pactolean &s;ands. As to the &s;tage, it is &s;unk, in my opinion, into the lowe&s;t degree; I mean with regard to the tra&s;h that is exhi|bited on it, but I don't attribute this to the ta&s;te of the audience, for when Shake&s;peare warbles his <Q REND="inline">"native wood notes,"</Q> the boxes, pit, and gallery, are crowded&mdash;and the Gods are true to every word, if properly winged to the heart.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival in town, I vi&s;ited We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; the moment I entered I felt a kind of awe pervade my mind, which I cannot de&s;cribe; the very &s;ilence &s;eemed &s;acred. Henry the Seventh's chapel is a very fine piece of Gothic architecture, particu|larly the roof, but I am told that it is exceeded by a chapel in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge. Mrs. Nightingale's monument has not been prai&s;ed beyond
<PB N="ix" REF="13">
its merit. The attitude and expre&s;&s;ion of the hu&s;|band, in endeavouring to &s;hield his wife from the dart of death, is natural and affecting. But I always thought that the image of death would be much better repre&s;ented with an extingui&s;hed torch, in|verted, than with a dart. Some would imagine that all the&s;e monuments were &s;o many monuments of folly&mdash;I don't think &s;o; what u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons of mor|tality and &s;ound philo&s;ophy do they not exhibit. When the high-born beauty &s;urveys her face in the poli&s;hed parian, though dumb the marble, yet it tells her that it was placed to guard the remains of as fine form, and as fair a face as her own. They &s;hew be&s;ides how anxious we are to extend our loves and friend&s;hip beyond the grave, and to &s;natch as much as we can from oblivion&mdash;&s;uch is our natural love of immortality; but it is here that letters obtain the noble&s;t triumphs; it is here that the &s;warthy daughters of Cadmus may hang their trophies on high, for when all the pride of the chi&s;&s;el, and the pomp of heraldry yield to the &s;ilent touches of time, a &s;ingle line, a half worn-out in&s;cription, remain faithful to their tru&s;t. Ble&s;t be the man, that fir&s;t introduced the&s;e &s;trangers into our i&s;lands, and may they never want protection or merit. I have not the lea&s;t doubt, that the fine&s;t poem in the Engli&s;h language, I mean Milton's II Pen&s;ero&s;o, was compo&s;ed in the long re&s;ounding i&s;le of a mouldering cloi&s;ter or ivy'd abbey. Yet after all, do you know that I would rather &s;leep in the &s;outhern corner of a little country church yard, than in the tomb of the Capulets. I &s;hould like, however, that my du&s;t &s;hould mingle with kindred du&s;t. The good old expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Fa|mily burying-ground,"</Q> has &s;omething plea&s;ing in it, at lea&s;t to me. I am glad that Dr. Sheridan is re|turned, and determined to &s;pend the re&s;t of his days in your quarter. I &s;hould &s;end him &s;ome Botanic writings, which I have in view, if I were not certain that the Iri&s;h Hippocrates would rather read nature in
<PB N="x" REF="14">
her own works; with what plea&s;ure I have &s;een him trace the delicate texture of a lily, and exclaim with the God in humanity, that <Q REND="inline">"Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of tho&s;e,"</Q> and you know that our lilies are fairer than new fallen &s;now. I am extremely &s;orry that any di&s;pute &s;hould ari&s;e betwixt you and your brother-in-law; he is, I know, a little hot-headed, e&s;pecially when he takes a gla&s;s, and I am afraid he leans a little too much to the &s;ocial can. Mr. Peyton, however, is a peace maker, and I am &s;ure, if the whole was laid before him, that he would &s;ettle it to your &s;atisfaction, and the &s;ooner the better. You are quite mi&s;taken when you think I don't ad|mire Plutarch, I prefer his writings to tho&s;e of any other.&mdash;<HI>Sacra &s;emper excipio, quae in &s;umm&acirc; arce locare fas e&s;t &amp; aequum nunquam non in manibus ha|benda.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Bal&s;e &s;ets out for Germany in the &s;pring, on a vi&s;it to his uncle, who is now in Vienna. The General is very rich, and advancing in years, &s;o that it is probable when he is called to repo&s;e on his laurels, that his nephew will be his heir, and I need not tell you that he is worthy of it. I expect, in a day or two, to be introduced to Mi&s;s Woffington, our country-woman. She is rapidly ri&s;ing into thea|tric &s;ame; I could wi&s;h to publi&s;h a few anecdotes of her.

<P>I once read of a King of Spain, Alphon&s;us, I think, who was cured of a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e by reading a pa&s;&s;age in Livy. Your kind letter had much the &s;ame effect on me, for my &s;pirits were &s;o low the moment I received it, that it is not in the power of words to de&s;cribe my &s;ituation; but &s;carce had I read &s;ix lines, when my heart began to emerge, and the &s;un &s;hone as bright as ever, and if you pity a poor dealer in Syntax, buried alive, I may &s;ay, write to me as often as you can. My &s;chool is on the increa&s;e, it is true, but the people are &s;o poor that they cannot pay. I have thirteen Latin &s;cholars, at a crown a quarter, and &s;ix and twenty in writing and figures. I have taken a little farm, of about five acres, &s;o that betwixt the cultivation of my fields, and that of the tender mind, I have very little time on my hands, or my feet, I may &s;ay, for &s;ometimes I mingle in the dance. As to Greek, there is no at|tention paid to it in this quarter. La&s;t week I en|deavoured to prevail on Mr. John&s;on to permit me to give his nephew a few le&s;&s;ons in the language of Heaven. He &s;aid he had no objection, if I could a&s;&s;ure him that it would enable Jack to buy a cow or a hor&s;e to more advantage. Having ca&s;t his eye on a Greek book, which I had in my hand, What, &s;aid he, would you have my nephew &s;pend his time in learning the&s;e pot-hooks and hangers?

Yet I join with you in ble&s;&s;ing the memory of the man that fir&s;t introduced the &s;warthy daughter of Cadinus into the&s;e i&s;lands.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s that naturally devolved on Mr. Burke, as private &s;ecre|tary to Mr. Hamilton, he had the happy art of ar|ranging his affairs in &s;uch a manner as to devote &s;ome moments to the cultivation of literature. He u&s;ed to pa&s;s two evenings every week in conver&s;ation with Doctor Thomas Wil&s;on, &s;enior Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and Doctor Blundell, the friends of humanity and letters. The former offered to join with Mr. Burke in a tran&s;lation of Livy, but the latter preferred reading the &s;ententious Tacitus to the prince of Roman hi&s;torians, and it appears from many parts of his maxims, &amp;c. that he &s;tudied this writer with unwearied attention. Doctor Wil&s;on was con&s;idered as a wit, but it &s;eldom ro&s;e above a pun. Mr. Burke happened to meet him one even|ing in a &s;hort coat, the Doctor immediately ob|&s;erving that his friend did not know him in that gui&s;e, exclaimed,
<Q><L>&mdash;Brevis e&s;&s;e laboro,</L>
<L>Ob&s;curus fio.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Doctor pa&s;&s;ing one day through a &s;treet, chanced to e&s;py a per&s;on advancing on the &s;ame &s;ide with whom he did not wi&s;h to &s;peak at that time, in con&s;equence of which he cro&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide,
<PB N="xvi" REF="20">
where he ran his head almo&s;t again&s;t another with whom he did not wi&s;h to &s;peak at any time, on which he repeated,

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the rays of regal favour &s;hone &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly through the Earl of Halifax, that it may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">id preferment was in his nod, and notwith|&s;tanding the pro&s;pects in this re&s;pect that opened on every &s;ide to Mr Burke, yet he pre&s;erved great equanimity of mind, and did not in the lea&s;t affect the in&s;olence of office. He corre&s;ponded with his friends in every line as u&s;ual, and received &s;uch as vi&s;ited him with great affection. His character, at this time, was drawn by a lady in the following lines:
<Q><L>With judgment witty, eloquent with &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>Polite with ea&s;e, and free without offence.</L></Q></P>
<P>This I had from a gentleman, who, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, was very well acquainted with <HI>Single Speech</HI> Hamilton, and <HI>Double Speech</HI> Burke.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton entertained &s;o high an opinion of the talents and integrity of Mr. Burke, that he pro|cured him a pen&s;ion of three hundred a year on the Iri&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment. On their return to England, they lived on terms of the greate&s;t intimacy, till the <HI>Proteg&eacute;,</HI> began to think that his patron did not exert all the influence he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to u&s;her him into life; &s;everal letters pa&s;&s;ed between them on this &s;ubject, which ended in the di&s;&s;olution of their political friend&s;hip, and in order to le&s;&s;en the debt of gratitude, Mr. Burke re&s;igned his pen&s;ion, which was transferred to Captain Jeph&s;on, author of the tragedy of Braganza, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke had now entered on the arduous &s;tudy of politics, he was determined not to relinqui&s;h the pur&s;uit, in hopes that &s;ome favourable opportunity would pre&s;ent it&s;elf, which, if taken at the tide, might
<PB N="xvii" REF="21">
lead on to fortune and preferment. The weakne&s;s and ill-timed mea&s;ures of the cabinet, with re&s;pect to the American colonies, threatened the downfal of the admini&s;tration; it la&s;ted, however, much longer than was expected; at length it was obliged to give way. Accordingly, on the 13th of April, 1765, the Marquis of Rockingham, William Dowde&s;well, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Lord John Cavendi&s;h, Thomas Town&s;hend, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and George On&s;low, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> were appointed Lords of the Trea&s;ury; Mr. Dowde&s;well Chancellor of the Exchequer; the Duke of Grafton and General Con|way, Secretaries of State. The Marquis felt him&s;elf in want of a private Secretary; Mr. Burke was re|commended to fill that confidential &s;ituation by Mr. Fitzherbert, the father of the pre&s;ent Lord St. Helens. Mr. Burke, in a &s;hort time, rendered him&s;elf &s;o u&s;e|ful, that he was brought into parliament for the bo|rough of Wendover, through the intere&s;t of Lord Verney. As the Marquis knew that fortune had only hitherto &s;miled on Mr. Burke deceitfully, he lent him &pound;20,000 on his bond, as the mo&s;t delicate mode of conferring &s;uch a &s;avour. Mr. Burke immedi|ately purcha&s;ed his elegant &s;eat near Beaconsfield with this &s;um, as an occa&s;ional retreat from the <Q REND="inline">"unea&s;y &s;eat of high de&s;ires,"</Q> or the conflict of pa&s;&s;ions, and happy would it have been for the world, perhaps, if he had thrown him&s;elf into the arms of phylo&s;ophy, and &s;pent the re&s;t of his days in the cultivation of tho&s;e arts which elevate and embelli&s;h human nature. But our young &s;tate&s;man had ta&s;ted of power, and preferred the noi&s;e and intrigue of party to lettered ea&s;e and retirement in his enchanting Tu&s;culum.</P>
<P>Mr Burke may be now con&s;idered as a fair public character, and therefore when the <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory of the Man,"</Q> to u&s;e Lord Bolingbroke's expre&s;&s;ion, is al&s;o the <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;tory of the State,"</Q> great judgment is re|quired in &s;electing, and ability in compo&s;ing, to produce a full, uniform, and compacted piece.

<P>As the Duke of Cumberland had recommended the new mini&s;try, he con&s;tantly a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with his advice; an advantage, which, it is very probable, the nation could not have enjoyed under any other mini&s;try, and which, alone, might compen&s;ate all the defects, if real, which the friends of the old mini&s;try were continually finding in them. This advantage, however, though of continuance enough to be felt by the nation, did not la&s;t as long as the nation could have wi&s;hed, even under men of equal integrity and capacity with the pre&s;ent, and greater experience. Whil&s;t his Royal Highne&s;s was preparing one even|ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t at one of tho&s;e councils, frequently held to put matters in a way of being more &s;peedily di&s;|patched by the Privy Council, and without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Privy Council bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t go on &s;lowly, as the parliam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nt bu&s;ine&s;s without that of the Committees, he was &s;eized with a &s;udden di&s;order, of which he had &s;ome &s;ymptoms the evening before, and in a &s;it of &s;hivering &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s, almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly, in the arms of the Earl of Albemarle, on the gi&s;t of October, 1765<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annual Regi&s;ter for 1765.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed that it would be almo&s;t an apology of it&s;elf for the introduction of the following &s;ketch of parties, &amp;c. at this period, to &s;ay that it came from the pen of Mr. Burke.

Such, and &s;o gloomy was the pro&s;pect that opened at home upon us, along with the year; nor did the view become more plea&s;ing by extending it acro&s;s the Atlantic, where the colonies exhibited nothing but &s;cenes of anarchy and confu&s;ion, where licentiou&s;ne&s;s was carried almo&s;t to the highe&s;t pitch that it could po&s;&s;ibly admit, without a&s;&s;uming another name; whil&s;t the profligate and abandoned (as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e in civil commotions) under the &s;pe|cious pretext and ma&s;k of liberty and the common cau&s;e, gave a loo&s;e to their own unruly pa&s;&s;ions, and committed all tho&s;e exorbitances which the vul|gar are &s;o prone to, when under any pretence they are allowed to a&s;&s;emble in bodies, and through any relaxation of the laws, they have not the fears of immediate puni&s;hment upon them. We have before ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e of an higher rank among&s;t them did not take any pains to allay the ferment; it is probable that many of the more &s;erious of them condemned in their own minds &s;everal acts that were committed, but did not think proper to damp a &s;pirit, which, however irregularly or improperly exerted, they, perhaps, at that time, thought it conducive to their de&s;igns to keep alive.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But though a violent re&s;entment &s;upported the &s;pirit of the coloni&s;ts, they could not but &s;en&s;ibly feel the inconveniencies which an intire &s;toppage of trade mu&s;t occa&s;ion among a people who had hitherto &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted by commerce. However, their warehou&s;es were full of Briti&s;h goods, for which they had not paid; and the many re&s;ources of &s;o va&s;t an extent of country, abounding in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles of life, prevented them from feeling &s;o much immediate di&s;tre&s;s as our own manufacturers and labouring poor at home.</Q></P>

<P>Hitherto matters had gone on in the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful manner with the mini&s;try; they had weathered a &s;e|vere, dangerous, and &s;tormy winter; they had gained every point they attempted in parliament; and had &s;ecured the confidence and good will of the public in a very high degree. They had be&s;ides acquired &s;ome credit in their foreign tran&s;actions; they had concluded an advantageous commercial treaty with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; they &s;ettled the long conte&s;ted affair of the Canada bills, to the &s;atisfaction of the owners of them; and made &s;ome progre&s;s in re|viving

the long neglected affair of the Manilla ran&s;om.</P>
<P>From the time that the Right Hon. Henry Bel&s;on Legge, was di&s;charged from the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, in May 1761, and Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt re&s;igned the 18th of September that year, no le&s;s than 523 changes of places, outs and inns, happened, by the fluctuating of mini&s;terial in|fluence, a circum&s;tance hardly to be parallelled in any annals.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had not con&s;idered the fluctuating &s;tate of admini&s;tration for &s;ome years back, might have been apt to imagine, that in con&s;equence of &s;o fair a beginning, they were &s;ecurely fixed in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>It was then, to the great &s;urpri&s;e of the nation, that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e appearances, a &s;udden and unexpected change took place in the mini&s;try. For on the 30th of July, the Duke of Grafton was ap|pointed to the head of the trea&s;ury, in the room of the Marquis of Rockingham; the Earl of Shelburne, Secretary of State, in the room of the Duke of Richmond; Lord Camden, High Chancellor, in the room of the Earl of Northington; Right Hon. Charles Town&s;hend, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the room of the Right Hon. William Dowde&s;well; and the Right Hon. William Pitt, (created &s;ome days before Vi&s;count Pyn&s;ent and Earl of Chatham) Lord Privy Seal. Many other changes took place both at home and &s;ub&s;equently in all the different depart|ments of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The patriotic opinion which has been conceived of the late mini&s;try, was much increa&s;ed by the di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s they had &s;hewn upon quitting their places; as they retired without a place, pen&s;ions, or rever&s;ion &s;ecured to them&s;elves or their friends. The &s;en&s;e which the public held of their &s;ervices, was al&s;o te&s;tified by the numerous addre&s;&s;es which were pre&s;ented to the Marquis of Rockingham upon that occa&s;ion. On the other hand, many of tho&s;e who
<PB N="xxviii" REF="32">
were mo&s;t attached to the Earl of Chatham regretted, that in&s;tead of weakening and dividing an intere&s;t, which the public wi&s;hed to be &s;upported, and con|tributing to remove a mini&s;try, in which they had placed a confidence; he had mo&s;t rather, by coin|ciding and acting along with them, contributed to give them that permanency, which was &s;o much de|&s;ired and wanted. There were other rea&s;ons which contributed greatly to le&s;&s;en the popularity of which the noble Lord had before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o boundle&s;s a &s;hare; among tho&s;e, his quitting the Hou&s;e of Com|mons and accepting peerage, was not the lea&s;t; and his acting alone with, and bringing into place and power, per&s;ons who had the misfortune to be &s;up|po&s;ed of a party, which had been long held very obnoxious, contributed its full &s;hare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annual Regi&s;ter for 1766.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>The following is Mr. Burke's own account of his introduction into public life, as well as the &s;hare which admini&s;tration took in the repeal of the &s;tamp-act.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Sir, I will an&s;wer him (Mr. Cornwall) as clearly as I am able, and with great openne&s;s; I have no|thing to conceal. In the year &s;ixty-five, being in a very private &s;tation, far enough from any line of bu&s;ine&s;s, and not having the honour of a &s;eat in this hou&s;e, it was my fortune, unknowing and unknown to the then mini&s;try, by the intervention of a com|mon friend, to become connected with a very noble per&s;on (Marquis of Rockingham) and at the head of the trea&s;ury department. It was indeed in a &s;itua|tion of little rank and no con&s;equence, &s;uitable to the mediocrity of my talents and preten&s;ions. But a &s;ituation near enough to enable me to &s;ee, as well as others, what was going on; and I did &s;ee in that noble per&s;on &s;uch &s;ound principles, &s;uch an enlarge|ment of mind, &s;uch clear and &s;agacious &s;en&s;e, and &s;uch un&s;haken fortitude, as have bound me, as well as others much better than me, by an inviolable at|tachment
<PB N="xxix" REF="33">
to him from that time forward. Sir, Lord Rockingham very early in that &s;ummer received a &s;trong repre&s;entation from many weighty Engli&s;h merchants and manufacturers, from governors of provinces and commanders of men of war, again&s;t almo&s;t the whole of the American commercial regu|lations, and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the Spani&s;h trade. I believe, Sir, the noble Lord &s;oon &s;aw his way in this bu&s;ine&s;s. But he did not ra&s;hly determine again&s;t acts which it migh be &s;uppo&s;ed were the re&s;ult of much delibera|tion. However, Sir, he &s;carcely began to open the ground, when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm. A violent outcry of all (except tho&s;e who knew and felt the mi&s;chief) was rai&s;ed again&s;t any alteration. On one hand, his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public law.&mdash;On the other, the act of navigation and all the corps of trade laws were drawn up in array again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t &s;tep the noble Lord took, was to have the opinion of his excellent, learned, and ever lamented friend, the late Mr. Yorke, then Attorney General, on the point of law. When he knew that formally and officially, which in &s;ub&s;tance he had known be|fore, he immediately di&s;patched orders to redre&s;s the grievance. But I will &s;ay it for the then mini&s;ter, he is of that con&s;titution of mind, that I know he would have i&s;&s;ued, on the &s;ame critical occa&s;ion, the very &s;ame orders, if the acts of trade had been, as they were not, directly again&s;t him; and would have chearfully &s;ubmitted to the equity of parliament for his indemnity.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On the conclu&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s of the Spani&s;h trade, the news of the troubles, on account of the &s;tamp-act, arrived in England. It was not until the end of October that the&s;e accounts were received. No &s;ooner had the &s;ound of that mighty tempe&s;t reached us in England, than the whole of the then oppo&s;ition, in&s;tead of feeling humbled by the un|happy
<PB N="xxx" REF="34">
i&s;&s;ue of their mea&s;ures, &s;eemed to be infinitely elated, and cried out, that the mini&s;try, from envy to the glory of their predece&s;&s;ors, were prepared to repeal the &s;tamp-act. Near nine years after, the ho|nourable gentleman takes quite oppo&s;ite ground, and now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> me to put my hand to my heart, and &s;ay, whether the mini&s;try had re&s;olved on the repeal till a con&s;iderable time after the meeting of parlia|ment. Though I do not very well know what the honourable gentleman wi&s;hes to infer from the ad|mi&s;&s;ion, or from the denial of this fact, on which he &s;o earne&s;tly adjures me; I do put my hand on my heart, and a&s;&s;ure him, that they did <HI>not</HI> come to a re|&s;olution directly to repeal. They weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required. They con|&s;idered maturely among them&s;elves. They con&s;ulted with all who could give advice or information. It was not determined until a little before the meeting of parliament; but it was determined, and the main lines of their own plan marked out, before that meeting. Two que&s;tions aro&s;e (I hope I am not going into a narrative trouble&s;ome to the Hou&s;e)</Q></P>
<P>[A cry of, go on, go on.]</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t of the two con&s;iderations was, whether the repeal &s;hould be total, or whether only partial; taking out every thing burthen&s;ome and productive, and re&s;erving only an empty acknowledgment, &s;uch as a &s;tamp on cards or dice. The other que&s;tion was, on what principle the act &s;hould be repealed? On this head al&s;o two principles were &s;tarted. One, that the legi&s;lative rights of this country, with regard to America, were not entire, but had certain re&s;tric|tions and limitations. The other principle was, that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the colonies were founded; and contrary to every idea of political equity, by which equity we are bound, as much as po&s;&s;ible to extend the &s;pirit and benefit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution to every part of the Briti&s;h dominions.
<PB N="xxxi" REF="35">
The option, both of the mea&s;ure, and of the prin|ciple of repeal, was made before the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and I wonder how any one can read the king's &s;peech at the opening of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, without &s;eeing in that &s;peech both the repeal and the declaratory act very &s;ufficiently crayoned out. Tho&s;e who cannot &s;ee this can &s;ee nothing.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Surely the honourable gentleman will not think that a great deal le&s;s time than was then employed, ought to have been &s;pent in deliberation; when he con&s;iders that the news of the troubles did not arrive till towards the end of October. The parliament &s;at to fill the vacancies on the 14th day of December, and on bu&s;ine&s;s the 14th of the following January."&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Speech on American Taxation.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke then proceeded to &s;tate the principle on which admini&s;tration acted in the repeal of this act.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A partial repeal,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"or as the bon ton of the court then was, a modification, would have &s;atisfied a timid, un&s;y&s;tematic, procra&s;tinating mi|ni&s;try, as &s;uch a mea&s;ure has &s;ince done &s;uch a mi|ni&s;try. A modification is the con&s;tant re&s;ource of weak, undeciding minds. To repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble (and this too did not want advi&s;ers), would have cut, in the heroic &s;tile, the Gordian knot with a &s;word. Either mea&s;ure would have co&s;t no more than a day's debate. But when the total repeal was adopted, and adopted on principles of policy, of equity, and of commerce, this plan made it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into many and difficult mea&s;ures. It becomes nece&s;&s;ary to open a very large field of evidence commen&s;urate to the&s;e exten&s;ive views. *** I think the enquiry la&s;ted in the committee for &s;ix weeks; and at its conclu&s;ion this hou&s;e, by an independent, noble, &s;pirited, and un|expected majority,&mdash;by a majority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in parliament,&mdash;in the teeth of all the old mercenary Swi&s;s of &s;tate,&mdash;in de&s;pite of all the &s;peculators and augurs of poli|tical

events,&mdash;in defiance of the whole embattled le|gion of veteran pen&s;ioners and practi&s;ed in&s;truments of a court, gave a total repeal to the &s;tamp-act, and (if it had been &s;o permitted) a la&s;ting peace to this whole empire."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke then adds, <Q REND="inline">"if the conduct of mini&s;try in prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">g the repeal, had ari&s;en from timidity with regard to them&s;elves, it would have been greatly to be condemned. Intere&s;ted timidity di&s;graces as much in this cabinet, as per&s;onal timidity does in the field. But timidity, with regard to the well being of our country, is heroic virtue. The noble Lord (Marquis of Rockingham) who then conducted affairs, and his worthy colleagues, whil&s;t trembling at the pro&s;pects of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es as you have &s;ince brought upon your&s;elves, were not afraid &s;teadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence, at which the eyes of eagles have blanched. He looked in the face one of the able&s;t, and let me &s;ay, not the mo&s;t &s;crupulous oppo&s;itions that perhaps ever was in this hou&s;e, and with&s;tood it, unaided by even one of the u&s;ual &s;upports of admini&s;tration."</Q></P>
<P>Short a time as Mr. Burke was in office, he took care to render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;omething more than what Mr. Canning calls the <HI>mechanical</HI> part of it, and accordingly we find him in oppo&s;ition unfold the intrigues of the new admini&s;tration with uncommon art and dexterity&mdash;nor was he &s;paring of ridicule, which he always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ot with unerring hand;&mdash;in &s;hort it may be &s;aid that he brightened from colli&s;ion, and gathered &s;trength even from defeat. Tho&s;e that wre&s;tle with us, as he &s;ays him&s;elf, &s;trengthen us,&mdash;nor did he confine his attacks to the &s;enate, for he and his bro|ther Richard, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his relative William Burke, publi&s;hed &s;everal papers in defence of the Rocking|ham party, in the Gazetteer, under various &s;ignatures, from the year 1766 to 1768. Some of tho&s;e papers were written in an&s;wer to Mr. Scott, of Cambridge, who appeared at the time under the &s;ignature of Ante|&s;ejanus.
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="37">
As Mr. Burke was naturally of an active di&s;po&s;ition of mind, his moments were con&s;tantly employed, either in con&s;ulting the be&s;t writers, conver&s;ing with the mo&s;t intelligent on the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ubjects, occa&s;ionally pruning his trees, or directing his rivulets.

<P>In 1766, Mr. Burke paid a vi&s;it to Ireland, where he found a number of per&s;ons, who had di&s;covered that they were related to him, &s;ince he became a Briti&s;h Senator. He did not, however, forget his <HI>old</HI> friends in the long li&s;t of his <HI>new</HI> relations&mdash;he vi&s;ited all, received all with affability and good na|ture, retraced with rapture the &s;cenes of his boyi&s;h days&mdash;and returned to his duty in the latter end of March 1768; in the &s;ame year he was returned at the general election for the borough of Malton in York&s;hire, through the intere&s;t of the Marquis, his patron.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1768 was opened with a clouded pro&s;pect. The high price of provi&s;ions was very &s;everely felt by tho&s;e who earned them with the &s;weat of their brow; the re&s;training act relative to the Ea&s;t India company; the <HI>Nullum Tempus Bill,</HI> afforded ample room for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Mr. Burke took a very active part in all tho&s;e que&s;tions, in which he was very ably &s;upported by Mr. Dowde&s;well, Mr. Dun|ning, (late Lord A&s;hburton) and Colonel Barr&eacute;. Such union of talents was equal to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of any &s;ubject that could po&s;&s;ibly be advanced. Mr.
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="38">
Burke was always found on his po&s;t, the fir&s;t on the breach, and the la&s;t on the mine. The brilliancy of his talents was &s;o univer&s;ally felt and acknowledged, that he was ranked as the leader of the Rockingham party.</P>
<P>Sometimes his zeal, and the natural warmth of his temper, would urge him to pre&s;s a point beyond its due bounds, which afforded his opponents a tempo|rary triumph;&mdash;temporary indeed! for the ea&s;e and ingenuity with which he u&s;ed to recover his previous po&s;ition, evinced the re&s;ources of his mind, and the &s;ubtilty of his imagination, which induced the great Lord Chatham to &s;ay on one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, that Burke could only be wounded by Burke.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, it is true, enli&s;ted under the ban|ners of party, but as that party may be called the guardian of the con&s;titution, he was left at full liberty to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch mea&s;ures as would forward or &s;ecure the mo&s;t patriotic objects; in &s;hort he was left to the full di&s;play of his own powers and opinions, and rather led than followed in almo&s;t every debate.</P>
<P>The Duke of Grafton was daily lo&s;ing ground; an admini&s;tration, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o chequered and &s;peckled, a piece of joinery &s;o cro&s;sly indented, and &s;o whim&s;i|cally dovetailed,"</Q> could not &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t the eloquence of Mr. Burke, and the pen of Junius. Accordingly, on the 28th of January, 1770, his Grace re&s;igned his &s;ituation, as fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, and was &s;ucceeded by the Right Hon. Frederick Lord North. Mr. Burke de&s;cribes the &s;ituation of public affairs at this period in the follow|ing words:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nobody, I believe, will con&s;ider it merely as the language of &s;pleen or di&s;appointment, if I &s;ay, that there is &s;omething particularly alarming in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. There is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language. That government is at once dreaded and contemned; that the laws are de&s;poiled of all their re&s;pect and
<PB N="xxxv" REF="39">
&s;alutary terrors; that their inaction is a &s;ubject of ridicule, and their exertion of abhorrence; that rank, and office, and title, and all the &s;olemn plau|&s;ibilities of the world, have lo&s;t their reverence and effect; that our foreign politics are as much de|ranged as our dome&s;tic oeconomy; that our depen|dencies are &s;lackened in their affection, and loo&s;ened from their obedience; that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce; that hardly any thing above or below, abroad or at home, is &s;ound and entire; but that di&s;connexion and confu&s;ion, in office, in parties, in families, in parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the di&s;orders of any former time:&mdash;the&s;e are facts univer&s;ally admitted and la|mented."</Q></P>

But the alarming &s;tate of the nation forced me to come forward, once more, and to exe|cute that duty which I owe to God, to my &s;overeign, and to my country, and I am determined to perform it at the ri&s;k of my life;"</Q> and in the&s;e three points of view, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that he performed his vow as a man, an hereditary coun&s;ellor of the crown, and a patriot, nobly falling with a falling &s;tate; but though he rai&s;ed his voice to Heaven, and poured the balm of conciliation from his lips, that warning voice was not attended to, and his venerable figure, and the fire of his imagination, were the only things that &s;eem to have made an impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e that heard him.

&s;peech, <Q REND="inline">"He lamented the unhappy mea&s;ure which had divided the colonies from the mother country, and which, he feared, had drawn them into exce&s;&s;es which he could not ju&s;tify. He owned his natural partiality to America, and was inclined to make al|lowance even for tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es; that they ought to be treated with tenderne&s;s; for in his &s;en&s;e they were ebullitions of liberty, which broke out upon the &s;kin, and were a &s;ign, if not of perfect health, at lea&s;t, of a vigorous con&s;titution, and mu&s;t not be driven in too &s;uddenly, lea&s;t they &s;hould &s;trike to the heart. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf entirely ignorant of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of America, therefore &s;hould be cautious of giving any opinion of the mea&s;ures fit to be pur&s;ued with re&s;pect to that country. That it was a maxim he had ob&s;erved through life, when he had lo&s;t way, to &s;top &s;hort, le&s;t by proceeding with|out knowledge, and advancing (as he feared a noble Duke had done) from one fal&s;e &s;tep to another, he &s;hould wind him&s;elf into an inextricable labyrinth, and never be able to recover the right road again. That as the Hou&s;e had yet no materials before them, by which they might judge of the proceedings of the colonies, he &s;trongly objected to their pa&s;&s;ing that heavy cen&s;ure upon them, which was conveyed in the word <HI>unwarrantable,</HI> contained in the propo&s;ed addre&s;s; that it was pa&s;&s;ing a &s;entence without hear|ing the cau&s;e, or being acquainted with facts; might expo&s;e the proceedings of the Hou&s;e to be received abroad with indifference or di&s;re&s;pect; that if <HI>un|warrantable</HI> meant any thing, it mu&s;t mean illegal, and how could their Lord&s;hips decide that proceed|ings, which had not been &s;tated to them in any &s;hape, were contrary to law; that what he had heard of the combinations in America, and of their &s;uc|ce&s;s in &s;upplying them&s;elves with goods of their own manufacture, had, indeed, alarmed him much for the commercial intere&s;ts of the mother country; but he could not conceive in what &s;en&s;e they could be
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="41">
called illegal, much le&s;s how a declaration of that Hou&s;e could remove the evil; that they were dan|gerous, indeed, and he greatly wi&s;hed to have that word &s;ub&s;tituted for unwarrantable; that the di&s;con|tent of two millions of people de&s;erved con&s;idera|tion, and the foundation of it ought to be removed; that this was the true way of putting a &s;top to com|binations and manufactures in that country; but that he re&s;erved him&s;elf to give his opinion more parti|cularly upon this &s;ubject, when authentic informa|tion of the &s;tate of America &s;hould be laid before the Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That we &s;hould be cautious how we invaded the liberties of any part of our fellow-&s;ubjects, how|ever remote in &s;ituation, or unable to make re&s;i&s;t|ance; that liberty was a plant that de&s;erved to be cheri&s;hed; that he loved the tree, and wi&s;hed well to every branch of it; that like the vine in &s;crip|ture, it had &s;pread from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, had embraced whole nations with its branches, and &s;heltered them under its leaves; that the Americans had purcha&s;ed their liberty at a dear rate, &s;ince they had quitted their native country, and gone in &s;earch of freedom to a de&s;ert."</Q></P>
<P>In 1772 and 1773, the Ea&s;t-India affairs were &s;ubmitted to the attention and con&s;ideration of par|liament; two committees were appointed to examine and report on this &s;ubject. The fir&s;t was an open committee, and the &s;econd a &s;ecret one. The former was very &s;low in their proceedings, and the latter very ha&s;ty. This contra&s;t furni&s;hed Mr. Burke with abundant plea&s;antry. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a &s;ubject of &s;uch magnitude, he gave evident proofs that it was not beyond his reach; nay, that he was very intimate with the mo&s;t intricate parts of it, but majorities triumphed over arguments.

in India for a time to be limited, Mr. Burke addre&s;&s;ed the Chairman thus:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Bacon, you are every thing, but what you &s;hould be; you are chairman of a committee in the air&mdash;we are a committee of imagination, of idea, of every thing but reality; and we might as well be employed in building ca&s;tles in the air. But, Sir, I cannot help mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly remarking, how amazingly the opinions of men change! What has now taken place is a &s;pecial in&s;tance of it. When a propo&s;ition comes originally from this &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, it is heard with di&s;gu&s;t, and treated with contempt; &s;uch rea|&s;ons, however, accompany it, as convince even the antagoni&s;ts of the idea: it pa&s;&s;es through the political elaboratory; the &s;un &s;hines from the trea&s;ury-bench on it; it is given to the Hou&s;e, and heard with ap|plau&s;e. This, Sir, I have &s;een more than once; and any member who will take the trouble of re|collecting what I have advanced more than once within the&s;e ten days, mu&s;t al&s;o plainly perceive it now adopted, in a manner which &s;hews the conviction of that bench but clogged, damned, with attendants which &s;eem coined to de&s;troy all the good that could re&s;ult from the other. Why will not the noble Lord at once declare, or give up the right of the crown to the territorial acqui&s;itions? Why is that fanta&s;tic right to hang eternally over their heads, in order to de&s;troy that very &s;olidity which he affects to give the Company?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, I was an&s;wered in a former committee, that I did not adhere to the que&s;tion; but, Sir, it was a reply of ignorance alone. If the propo&s;ers of a motion will pa&s;s the plain road that leads to common &s;en&s;e, in order to wander into a rotten bog, the man who calls them back again, and tells them they will &s;oon be up to the chin in that ground, is he the man who runs from the que&s;tion?

all his propo&s;itions &s;trings of contradictions. Let him declare that right, on the &s;trength of which he &s;eizes with the hand of power, and the Hou&s;e will &s;upport him.

Let him offer a purge, you will &s;wallow it&mdash;a vomit, it will go down&mdash;an alterative or a&s;tringent&mdash;an acid or an alkali&mdash;all one&mdash;down it goes. While the noble Lord finds we have &s;uch a &s;wallow, let him give the pill at once without gilding&mdash;let him fairly declare the degree of this accur&s;ed right, which hangs thus in terrorem on your trade to the ea&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke had now &s;hone with encrea&s;ing lu&s;tre as the &s;teady advocate of civil liberty, and, in order to compleat his character as a patriot and &s;enator, he availed him&s;elf of the fir&s;t opportunity to evince his attachment to the cau&s;e of religious liberty.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth of February, 1773, Sir Harry Houghton moved for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, in &s;undry matters re|lating to &s;ub&s;cription. It was vehemently oppo&s;ed by Sir William Baggot on two grounds, fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e the penal laws again&s;t &s;uch of the Di&s;&s;enters as did not &s;ub&s;cribe were never put in force; and, &s;econdly, becau&s;e he believed that the attempt to &s;et a&s;ide the thirty-nine articles was agitated with a de|&s;ign unfavourable to Chri&s;tianity, Mr. Burke, in reply, &s;poke nearly to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I propo&s;e, Sir, taking notice of what fell from the honourable gentleman's lips, con&s;idered in a two-fold view. He advanced the following po&s;itions, that the Di&s;&s;enters now enjoyed liberty by connivance, and that toleration was an attack upon Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;The Di&s;&s;enters enjoy liberty by connivance! My good Sir, what &s;ort of liberty is this? What, Sir, is liberty by connivance but a temporary relaxation of &s;lavery? Is this a &s;ort of liberty calculated for the meridian of England? Monte&s;quieu places liberty in an exemp|tion from fear. Are per&s;ons who enjoy it by conni|vance only&mdash;are they exempt from fear, and dive&s;ted
<PB N="xl" REF="44">
of apprehen&s;ion? To talk then, Sir, of a connivance, is to talk only of a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of tyranny. You are de&s;irous to keep the rod hanging over the Di&s;&s;enters' heads at the very in&s;tant that you a&s;&s;ure them they &s;hall never &s;mart under its &s;tripes. Why then at once not &s;et their hearts at re&s;t, by removing the impending danger? Why not relea&s;e them from the dread of the&s;e penal &s;tatutes, the cruelty of which &s;o &s;hocks your generous natures, that you think it incumbent on you to declare they never &s;hould be put in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o execution? The que&s;tion, Sir, an&s;wers it&s;elf; and to cavil at its propriety is to carp at truth and elude conviction.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to what the honourable gentleman let fall concerning toleration being an attack upon Chri&s;ti|anity, it is an a&s;&s;ertion &s;o contrary to truth and hi&s;|tory, that it &s;carcely &s;tands in need of refutation. By toleration Chri&s;tianity flouri&s;hed. Whil&s;t the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern churches were tolerant, they were illu&s;trious; they were venerated; they were held in &s;acred e&s;timation. When the Romi&s;h Church ca&s;t a&s;ide its toleration, and had recour&s;e to threatenings, &s;laughter and per&s;ecutions; commotions en&s;ued; eccle&s;ia&s;tical anarchy prevailed; and the kingdom of darkne&s;s was erected on the ruins of Chri&s;tianity. In&s;tead of combating the common foe, Chri&s;tians combated each other. In&s;tead of taking arms again&s;t the grand deceivers, they &s;trove by every deceptious art to harra&s;s and torment tho&s;e whom they ought to have cheri&s;hed and loved as brethren. In &s;hort the want of toleration has le&s;&s;ened the number of be|lievers, and for that rea&s;on I would have all Pro|te&s;tants united, that we may be the better enabled to make a common cau&s;e again&s;t infidels of every deno|mination.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Church of England, Sir, has not a firmer friend than my&s;elf&mdash;I wi&s;h her illu&s;trious&mdash;I wi&s;h her head may reach that Heaven to which &s;he would conduct us&mdash;But I would al&s;o wi&s;h her family as
<PB N="xli" REF="45">
numerous as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;I would wi&s;h a brotherly affection to prevail among her offspring&mdash;I would have Chri&s;tians united&mdash;I would have them join in every attempt to cru&s;h the powers of darkne&s;s, and trample under foot the foe to God and man; like a mother, tender of her children, I would have the Church, with wide extended arms, receive in her bo&s;om every believing &s;on; not, with unnatural au&s;terity, reproach her offspring, and drive them to &s;eek for ea&s;e, for plea&s;ure, and for comfort, in the harlot lap of infidelity."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech made a great impre&s;&s;ion in and out of doors, which is not to be wondered at, if we con&s;ider the height from whence it fell; &s;urely it was time that Religion &s;hould cea&s;e to be a crime, and that puni&s;hment &s;hould not reach tho&s;e that were guilty of no other. Per&s;ecution, as the late Earl of Mansfield &s;aid, may make hypocrites and martyrs, but never made a real convert; and it is &s;trange that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould imagine that the thirty-nine articles of the Church of England &s;hould be fenced with oaths and perjuries. This would be to plant reeds round an oak to defend it from a &s;torm. When penal laws are repealed in the heart, they ought not to be found on the &s;tatute books.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Houghton's motion was very favour|ably received; leave was given to bring in the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed the Commons without a divi&s;ion, but was lo&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Lords on the &s;econd read|ing, by a great majority.</P>
<P>An act was pa&s;&s;ed on the 25th of March, 1774, called the Bo&s;ton Port Bill, which threw the inhabi|tants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's into the greate&s;t con&s;ternation. The town of Bo&s;ton pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution, expre&s;&s;ing their &s;en&s;e of this oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ure, and a de&s;ire that all the colonies would concur to &s;top all im|portation from Great Britain. Mo&s;t of the colonies entered into &s;pirited re&s;olutions on this occa&s;ion, to unite with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's in a firm oppo&s;ition to the uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures of the parliament. The
<PB N="xlii" REF="46">
fir&s;t of June, the day on which the Port Bill was to take place, was appointed to be kept as a day of humiliation, fa&s;ting, and prayer, throughout the colo|nies, to &s;eek the divine direction and aid, in that critical and gloomy junction of affairs.</P>
<P>During the height of the con&s;ternation and confu|&s;ion which the Bo&s;ton Bort Bill occa&s;ioned; at the very time when a town meeting was &s;itting to con&s;i|der of it, General Gage, who had been appointed to the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's, arrived in the harbour. His arrival, however, did not allay the popular ferment, or check the progre&s;s of the mea|&s;ure then taking to unite the colonies, in oppo&s;ition to the oppre&s;&s;ive act of parliament.</P>
<P>But the port bill was not the only act that alarmed the apprehen&s;ion of the Americans. Determined to compel the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's to &s;ubmit to their law, parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act for the better regulating government in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett's Bay. The object of this act was to alter the government, as it &s;tood in the charter of King Wil|liam, to take the appointment of the executive out of the hands of the people, and place it in the crown; thus making even the judges and &s;heriffs dependent on the king, and removeable only at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This act was &s;oon followed by another, which ordained, that any per&s;on, indicted for murder, or other capital offence, committed in aiding the ma|gi&s;trates in executing the laws, might be &s;ent by the governor either to another colony, or to Great Britain, for his trial.</P>
<P>This was &s;oon followed by the Quebec Bill, which extended the bounds of that province, and granted many privileges to the Roman Catholics. The object of this bill was, to &s;ecure the attachment of that province to the crown of England, and prevent its joining the colonies in their re&s;i&s;tance to the laws of parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="xliii" REF="47">But the&s;e mea&s;ures did not intimidate the Ame|ricans. On the other hand, they &s;erved to confirm their former apprehen&s;ions of the evil de&s;igns of government, and to unite the colonies in their oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>A corre&s;pondence of opinion with re&s;pect to the uncon&s;titutional acts of parliament, produced a uni|formity of proceedings in the colonies. The people generally concurred in a propo&s;ition for holding a congre&s;s by deputation from the &s;everal colonies, in order to concert mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of their rights. Deputies were accordingly appointed, and met at Philadelphia, on the 26th October, 1774.</P>
<P>On the 19th of April, 1774, Mr. Ro&s;e Fuller, member for Rye, made the following motion; that an act made in the &s;eventeenth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, intituled,
<Q REND="inline">"An act for granting cer|tain duties in the Briti&s;h colonies and plantations in America; for allowing a drawback of the duties of cu&s;toms upon the exportation from this kingdom of coffee and cocoa-nuts, of the produce of the &s;aid colonies or plantations; for di&s;continuing the drawbacks payable on china earthen ware exported to America; and for more effectually preventing the clande&s;tine running of goods in the &s;aid colo|nies and plantations,"</Q> might be read.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame being read accordingly; he moved, <Q REND="inline">"that this hou&s;e will, upon this day &s;e'nnight, re|&s;olve it&s;elf into a committee of the whole hou&s;e, to take into con&s;ideration the duty of 3d. per pound weight upon tea, payable in all his maje&s;ty's dominions in America, impo&s;ed by the &s;aid act; and al&s;o the appropriation of the &s;aid duty."</Q></P>
<P>A warm and intere&s;ting debate took place on the que&s;tion of American taxation, that, perhaps, to u&s;e Mr. Burke's expre&s;&s;ion, no topic had been more familiar to the hou&s;e. Mr. Wolfran Corn|wall took a wide view of it, and when it was thought that the &s;ubject was entirely exhau&s;ted, Mr.

Burke ro&s;e, and, to the &s;urprize of tho&s;e that were in the habits of admiring his powers, poured fre&s;h light upon it&mdash;not that light that mi&s;leads in propor|tion as it dazzles, but the &s;teady beam of rea&s;on and &s;ound argument that at once vivifies, charms, and illu|mines all that was dark. In &s;peaking of the repeal of the &s;tamp act, <Q REND="inline">"I affirm,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that when de|parting from the maxims of that repeal, you revived the &s;cheme of taxation, and thereby filled the minds of the coloni&s;ts with new jealou&s;y, and all &s;orts of apprehen&s;ions; then it was that they quarrelled with the old taxes, as well as the new; then it was, and not till then, that they que&s;tioned all the parts of your legi&s;lature; and by the battery of &s;uch que&s;tions have &s;haken the &s;olid &s;tructure of this empire to its deepe&s;t foundations."</Q> Mr. Burke followed up this a&s;&s;ertion with &s;uch damning proofs ari&s;ing out of the very acts, and &s;peeches of mini&s;ters them&s;elves, particularly in Lord Hill&s;borough's Letter to the American Go|vernors, dated May 13th, 1769, which he called the Canonical Book of Mini&s;terial Scripture, or the Ge|neral Epi&s;tle to the Americans; well knowing that his arguments on this head were unan&s;werable, he was re&s;olved not to omit the opportunity of a per&s;onal triumph. <Q REND="inline">"Upon the principles therefore, &s;aid he, of the honourable gentleman, (Mr. Cornwall) upon the principles of the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, the mini&s;ter has nothing at all to an&s;wer.

<P>Mr. Burke, in the cour&s;e of his &s;peech, made the following declaration.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will be content to be declared infamous, if I do not, to the la&s;t hour of my life, at all times, in all places, and upon all occa&s;ions, exert every power with which I either am, or ever &s;hall be legally inve&s;ted, in order to obtain and</HI> maintain <HI>for the continent of Ame|rica</HI>

<P>Having &s;hewn fir&s;t on the narrow ground, which Mr. Cornwall mea&s;ured, &s;ays he, that we were like to lo&s;e nothing, by complying with the motion, ex|cept what we had already lo&s;t, that in time of peace we flouri&s;hed in commerce, and when war required it, had &s;ufficient aid from the colonies, as long as we pur&s;ued our ancient policy, that the &s;tamp-act threw every thing into confu&s;ion, and that the repeal of it re&s;tored every thing to peace and order. That the revival of the &s;y&s;tem of taxation produced the very wor&s;t effects, and that the partial repeal produced, not partial good, but univer&s;al evil. "Let the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;aid he, founded on facts, not one of which can be denied, bring us back to our rea&s;on by the road of our experience. But alas! this was the old beaten road which mini&s;ters did not wi&s;h to tread, it was not &s;ufficiently &s;trewed with places and pen&s;ions. New paths mu&s;t be &s;truck out, new turnpikes erected, and additional toll paid.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke concluded this very able and argumen|tative &s;peech, with the following pa&s;&s;age, which many have con&s;idered as the key-&s;tone of the arch.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On this bu&s;ine&s;s of America, I confe&s;s I am &s;erious, <HI>even to &s;adne&s;s.</HI> I have had but one opinion concerning it &s;ince I &s;at, and before I &s;at in parlia|ment. The noble lord will, as u&s;ual, probably, at|tribute the part taken by me and my friends in this bu&s;ine&s;s, to a de&s;ire of getting his place. Let him enjoy this happy and original idea. If I deprived him of it, I &s;hould take away mo&s;t of his wit, and all his argument. But I had rather bear the brunt of all his wit, and indeed blows much heavier, than &s;tand an&s;werable to God for embracing a &s;y&s;tem that tends
<PB N="xlvi" REF="50">
to the de&s;truction of &s;ome of the very be&s;t and faire&s;t of his works. But I know the map of England, as well as the noble lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE>, or as any other per&s;on; and I know that the way I take is not the road to pre|ferment. My excellent and honourable friend under me on the floor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dowde&s;well.</NOTE>, has trod that road with great toil for upwards of twenty years together. He is not yet arrived at the noble lord's de&s;tination. However, the tracks of my worthy friend are tho&s;e I have ever wi&s;hed to follow; becau&s;e I know they lead to ho|nour. Long may we tread the &s;ame road together; whoever may accompany us, or whoever may laugh at us on our journey! I hone&s;tly and &s;olemnly de|clare, I have in all &s;ea&s;ons adhered to the &s;y&s;tem of 1766, for no other rea&s;on, than that I think it laid deep in your true&s;t intere&s;ts&mdash;and that, by unlimiting the exerci&s;e, it fixes on the firme&s;t foundations, a real, con&s;i&s;tent, well-grounded authority in parlia|ment. Until you come back to that &s;y&s;tem, there will be no peace for England."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman of talents, who had the good fortune to be pre&s;ent at the delivery of this &s;peech, has pourtrayed it thus: <Q REND="inline">"In this &s;peech he had occa&s;ion to &s;hew the original plan of government in taxing the colonies, and of cour&s;e to exhibit the characters that were officially concerned, either in its progre&s;s or oppo&s;ition. He began with the Right Honourable George Grenville, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1763, and then proceeded to the characters of the late Lord Chatham, late Right Honourable Charles Town&s;hend, (Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1766, and the re-producer of the taxation &s;cheme) the Mar|quis of Rockingham, and the late Field-Mar&s;hall Conway, with many others. Some of the&s;e charac|ters, who, when living, were in total oppo&s;ition to Mr. Burke's political &s;entiments on this &s;ubject; but now being dead, and their memories moreover being
<PB N="xlvii" REF="51">
warmly protected by many high per&s;onages as rela|tives and friends, pre&s;ented a &s;ubject very difficult and delicate to expand upon. Lord Chatham too was &s;till living, and though rather in the wane of his great political powers, yet, &s;urrounded by his former greatne&s;s, his accumulated wi&s;dom, and great ex|perience, he &s;tood as the great Mentor of oppo&s;ition, to whom all the parts occa&s;ionally looked up for ad|vice and protection. When we add to the&s;e, that the Marquis of Rockingham and Field-Mar&s;hall Conway were his particular friends&mdash;the difficulties of reproving and prai&s;ing became &s;o multiplied, that the undertaking &s;eemed to be one of tho&s;e traps which vanity &s;ometimes lays for great men, to &s;hew them the extent of their own pre&s;umption.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But Mr. Burke's mind was fully equal to the ta&s;k; all the leading and plea&s;ing features of tho&s;e great men who were his political opponents, he prai&s;ed with a manly openne&s;s that would have done honour to the warme&s;t and mo&s;t exalted friend&s;hip; even what he thought of their defects he &s;oftened in &s;uch a manner, by either attributing them to original opinions, or early habits, or the co-operation of party, that tho&s;e mo&s;t intimately attached to their memories could not be di&s;plea&s;ed with their general portraits."</Q></P>
<P>The late Lord John Cavendi&s;h had retired with other members to the gallery during the delivery of this &s;peech, and at Mr. Burke's de&s;cription of Ge|neral Conway's feelings&mdash;Good God exclaimed his Lord&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"What a man is this!&mdash;How could he acquire &s;uch tran&s;cendent powers?"</Q></P>
<P>At the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament on the la&s;t day of September, 1774, Mr. Burke made his elec|tion for Malton, but &s;carce was he returned, when a deputation from &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Mer|chants and Di&s;&s;enters in Bri&s;tol invited him to &s;tand for that city. He could not re&s;i&s;t &s;o flattering an in|vitation, &s;o that, to u&s;e George Selwyn's expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"he re&s;igned his little country wench for a fine city

dame, attired in the riche&s;t &s;ilks, and &s;howered with diamonds;"</Q> but it &s;hould not be forgotten that the&s;e ornaments were purcha&s;ed at the expence of human blood. The candidates who &s;tarted on this occa&s;ion were Lord Clare, one of the late Repre&s;entatives, who declined on the &s;econd day of the poll; Mr. Brickdale, and Mr. Cruger, an American merchant. Mr. Burke appeared on the Hu&s;tings on the afternoon of the &s;ixth day's poll. His addre&s;s to the electors, was manly, candid, and captivating&mdash;and &s;uch as might be expected from one, whom neither <Q REND="inline">"avarice or ambition had ju&s;tled out of the &s;traight line of duty."</Q> The exertions of his friends were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. It was certainly a very plea&s;ing &s;ight, to behold a man of Mr. Burke's &s;en&s;ibility &s;tanding amid&s;t the unbought plaudits of the populace, dumb with gratitude, till his tears got the &s;tart of his words&mdash;and as a gentleman, who was pre&s;ent, ob&s;erved it was hard to &s;ay which of the two was the more eloquent. The opening of his addre&s;s was worthy of the man void of all affectation, it aro&s;e naturally from the circum|&s;tances of the moment, and conveyed a fine compli|ment to the feelings of his colleague, Mr. Cruger&mdash;It ran thus:</P>

<P>Mr. Burke declared, that from the beginning to the end of the election, that he never a&s;ked a que&s;|tion of a voter on the other &s;ide, or &s;upported a doubtful one on his own; it is al&s;o well known that he never &s;olicited a vote in per&s;on&mdash;and yet it does not appear that he was deficient in election cant, from the following humourous &s;pecimen of it which he gave in the &s;ame &s;peech.</P>
<P>But how &s;hould I appear to the <HI>voters</HI> them&s;elves? If I had gone round to the citizens intitled to free|dom, and &s;queezed them by the hand&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Sir, I humbly beg your vote&mdash;I &s;hall be eternally thank|ful&mdash;may I hope for the honour of your &s;upport?&mdash;Well!&mdash;come&mdash;we &s;hall &s;ee you at the council-hou&s;e."</Q>
&mdash;If I were then to deliver them to my managers, pack them into tallies, vote them off in court, and when I heard from the bar&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Such a one only! and &s;uch a one for ever!&mdash;he's my man!"&mdash;"Thank you, good Sir&mdash;Hah! my wor|thy friend! thank you kindly&mdash;that's an hone&s;t fellow&mdash;how is your good family?"</Q>
&mdash;Whil&s;t the&s;e words were hardly out of my mouth, if I &s;hould have wheeled round at once, and told them&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Get you gone, you pack of worthle&s;s fellows! you have no votes&mdash;you are u&s;urpers! you are intru|ders on the rights of real freemen! I will have
<PB N="l" REF="54">
nothing to do with you! you ought never to have been produced at this election, and the &s;heriff's ought not to have admitted you to poll."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke was extremely happy in the locality of his &s;imiles during the election&mdash;witne&s;s the following:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As for the trifling petulance, which the rage of party &s;tirs up in little minds, though it &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf even in this court, it has not made the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on me. The highe&s;t flight of &s;uch cla|morous birds is winged in an inferior region of the air. We hear them, and we look upon them, ju&s;t as you, gentlemen, when you enjoy the &s;erene air on your lofty rocks, look down upon the gulls, that &s;kim the mud of your river, when it is exhau&s;ted of its tide."</Q></P>
<P>In this &s;peech Mr. Burke has drawn a picture of what he conceived to be the duty of a repre&s;entative to his con&s;tituents. The pa&s;&s;age is too fine to be omitted or abridged, e&s;pecially as it is a point on which the able&s;t writers are divided.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry I cannot conclude, without &s;aying a word on a topic touched upon by my worthy col|league. I wi&s;h that topic had been pa&s;&s;ed by, at a time when I have &s;o little lei&s;ure to di&s;cu&s;s it. But &s;ince he has thought proper to throw it out, I owe you a clear explanation of my poor &s;entiments on that &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">He tells you, that
<Q REND="inline">"the topic of in&s;tructions has occa&s;ioned much altercation and unea&s;ine&s;s in this city;"</Q>
and he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf (if I under&s;tand him rightly) in favour of the coercive authority of &s;uch in&s;tructions.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happine&s;s and glory of a repre&s;entative, to live in the &s;tricte&s;t union, the clo&s;e&s;t corre&s;pondence, and the mo&s;t un|re&s;erved communication with his con&s;tituents. Their wi&s;hes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion high re&s;pect; their bu&s;ine&s;s unremitted atten|tion. It is his duty to &s;acrifice his repo&s;e, his plea|&s;ures,
<PB N="li" REF="55">
his &s;atisfactions, to theirs; and, above all, ever, and in all ca&s;es, to prefer their intere&s;t to his own. But, his unbia&s;&s;ed opinion, his mature judg|ment, his enlightened con&s;cience, he ought not to &s;acrifice to you, to any man, or to any &s;et of men living. The&s;e he does not derive from your plea|&s;ure; no, nor from the law and the con&s;titution. They are a tru&s;t from Providence, for the abu&s;e of which he is deeply an&s;werable. Your repre&s;entative owes you, not his indu&s;try only, but his judgment; and he betrays, in&s;tead of &s;erving you, if he &s;acrifices it to your opinion.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My worthy colleague &s;ays, his will ought to be &s;ub&s;ervient to yours. If that be all, the thing is innocent. If government were a matter of will upon any &s;ide, yours, without que&s;tion, ought to be &s;u|perior. But government and legi&s;lation are matters of rea&s;on and judgment, and not of inclination; and, what &s;ort of rea&s;on is that, in which the deter|mination precedes the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; in which one &s;et of men deliberate, and another decide; and where tho&s;e who form the conclu&s;ion are perhaps three hundred miles di&s;tant from tho&s;e who hear the arguments?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">To deliver an opinion, is the right of all men; that of con&s;tituents is a weighty and re&s;pectable opinion, which a repre&s;entative ought always to rejoice to hear, and which he ought always mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider. But <HI>authoritative</HI> in&s;tructions; <HI>mandates</HI> i&s;&s;ued, which the member is bound blindly and im|plicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the cleare&s;t conviction of his judgement and con&s;cience; the&s;e are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which ari&s;e from a funda|mental mi&s;take of the whole order and tenour of our con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Parliament is not a <HI>congre&s;s</HI> of amba&s;&s;adors from different and ho&s;tile intere&s;ts; which intere&s;ts each mu&s;t maintain, as an agent and advocate, again&s;t other agents and advocates; but Parliament is a <HI>deli|berative</HI>

You chu&s;e a member indeed; but when you have cho&s;en him, he is not a member of Bri&s;tol, but he is a mem|ber of <HI>Parliament.</HI> If the local con&s;tituent &s;hould have an intere&s;t, or &s;hould form an ha&s;ty opinion, evidently oppo&s;ite to the real good of the re&s;t of the community, the member for that place ought to be as far, as any other, from any endeavour to get it effect. I beg pardon for &s;aying &s;o much on this &s;ub|ject. I have been unwillingly drawn into it; but I &s;hall ever u&s;e a re&s;pectful frankne&s;s of communica|tion with you.

<P>Mr. Burke having found by experience that a <Q REND="inline">"&s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance to every appearance of lawle&s;s power; a &s;pirit of independence carried to &s;ome degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m; an inqui&s;itive character to di&s;cover, and a bold one to di&s;play, every corrup|tion and every error of government,"</Q> had recom|mended him to a &s;eat for Bri&s;tol, he was determined to per&s;evere in the &s;ame &s;teady cour&s;e.</P>
<P>He had formed a mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip with Sir George Saville, that good man, who was very ju&s;tly looked up to as the land-mark of the con&s;titution, went to Ireland about this time, for the humane purpo&s;e of meliorating the condition of his numerous tenantry in that country. Having rode out one fro&s;ty morning without any attendant, he e&s;pied a man at a little di&s;tance, with whom he entered into conver&s;ation. Who does that mill belong to? I rent it, Sir. And what is the meaning that your mill is not better thatched, and your&s;elf better clad?&mdash;I
<PB N="liii" REF="57">
can't help it, Sir, I have a large family, and I a&s;&s;ure you we do not eat the bread of idlene&s;s, but I pay a high rent. Who is your landlord? An Engli&s;hman, Sir, and one of the be&s;t men, Sir George Saville. Why, how much do you pay an acre? Fourteen &s;hillings. What did you pay? Ten. Then take your bill, and write down ten, for I am your land|lord. The poor man could only look up to Heaven, as much as to &s;ay, you are dropped from thence. Sir George made &s;imilar deductions over all his e&s;tate, but he that was <Q REND="inline">"eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame,"</Q> was called too &s;oon to receive the reward of his virtue.</P>
<P>The public &s;tatue of the late Sir George Saville is erected in York Cathedral.

<P>'Tis not to be wondered at, if Mr. Burke's cha|racter as an orator and a &s;tate&s;man, was attacked by all the hireling &s;cribblers of admini&s;tration, but as he did not wi&s;h to deprive them of a <HI>dinner,</HI> he never conde&s;cended to take any notice of their &s;currility, it's a tax that every great character is doomed to pay, as Addi&s;on &s;ays, and he was de|termined to contribute his &s;hare to it. His judg|ment was now matured, and his fancy no longer &s;oared on trembling pinions, but gazed &s;tedfa&s;tly at the &s;un, or built its <HI>aerie</HI> on the brow of the mo&s;t arduous precipice. The American war was the theme of every tongue and every pen. Mr. Burke, as we have already ob&s;erved, took a decided part in it.
<PB N="lv" REF="59">
He re&s;olved to make one more effort to extingui&s;h the flames of civil di&s;cord, not even di&s;couraged by the rejection of a bill brought into the upper Hou&s;e by the Earl of Chatham, for &s;ettling the troubles in America. On the 22d of March, 1775, he brought forward his celebrated conciliatory propo&s;itions. His &s;peech on that occa&s;ion was conciliation indeed, in the true &s;pirit of conciliation, and may be truly termed his golden oration; though there is &s;carce a quotation in the whole, it may be &s;aid to contain the &s;pirit of all that ancient and modern writers have &s;aid on the fitte&s;t means of allaying all tho&s;e turbu|lent pa&s;&s;ions that civil war never fails to excite. As no man was better qualified to re&s;ort to the <Q REND="inline">"witne&s;s of time, the light of truth, the life of memory, and the me&s;&s;enger of antiquity,"</Q> his propo|&s;itions were founded on the be&s;t rules of rea&s;on, and though they were neither dictated by the pa&s;&s;ions, nor addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions, yet there is a certain atherial warmth that pervades all the arguments which he adduced in &s;upport of them, and, in many in&s;tances, they abound in all the bold <HI>relief</HI> of ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Throughout the whole he &s;eems to have had the advice of a celebrated &s;tate&s;man in view, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Omnia &s;unt in republica &s;uavi&s;&s;ime tractanda, arte quae leniat, non exa&s;peret: &s;anet, non ulceret: moveat, no perturbeat, non perturbeat, animos civium.</HI>"</Q> He put the dignity of Great Britain in one &s;cale, and her conce&s;&s;ion in the other, in order to prove that con|ciliation would add lu&s;tre to both.</P>
<P>In the opening of this &s;peech Mr. Burke de&s;cribes the progre&s;s of the di&s;contents of the Americans, and his own conduct, in that approaching &s;torm:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Surely"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"it is an awful &s;ubject; or there is none &s;o on this &s;ide of the grave.

I was not le&s;s under the nece&s;&s;ity of forming &s;ome fixed ideas, concerning the general policy of the Briti&s;h empire. Something of this &s;ort &s;eemed to be indi&s;|pen&s;ible; in order, amid&s;t &s;o great a fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ions and opinions, to concentre my thoughts; to balla&s;t my conduct; to pre&s;erve me from being blown about by every wind of fa&s;hionable doctrine.

<P><Q REND="inline">"At that period, I had the fortune to find my&s;elf in perfect concurrence with a large majority in this Hou&s;e.

Every thing admini&s;tered as a remedy to the public complaint, if it did not produce, was at lea&s;t followed by an heightening of the di&s;temper; until, by a variety of experiments, that important country has been brought into her pre&s;ent &s;ituation;

<P>The Americans had been traduced in the mini&s;te|rial prints as the &s;pawn of &s;tews and gaols, as the mere <HI>purgamenta urbium</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>New England was originally &s;ettled by a religious &s;ect, deno|minated puritans, who fled from the &s;evere re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon di&s;&s;enters in the reign of King James I. Placed beyond the fear of control, they formed a &s;y&s;tem of civil eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, exactly &s;uited to their rigid notions. All their in&s;titutions were marks of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal of religion. Removed from the tyranny of one church, they vibrated to the other extreme, with an order to build up Chri&s;t's kingdom, in what they quaintly call, a howling wilder|ne&s;s; they e&s;tabli&s;hed a tyranny of the &s;evere&s;t kind over the con|&s;ciences and rights of their own &s;ociety, and by arbitrary decrees bani&s;hed tho&s;e who differed from them upon the mo&s;t metaphy&s;ical points. It was a law of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers at Bo&s;ton, that none could be free men and entitled to vote for civil rulers, who were not in full communion with the church; and none could be admitted to full communion, without the recommendation of a clergyman. The&s;e laws threw all the power of the &s;tate into the hands of the clergy. It is equally a&s;toni&s;hing and ridiculous to the po&s;terity of tho&s;e godly people, to find the church and &s;tate, in the infancy of the &s;ettlement of America, rent with di&s;cord upon the &s;imple que&s;tion, whether &s;anctification precedes ju&s;tification. Yet hundreds of councils were held upon this or &s;imilar points, and a di&s;&s;ent from the common opinion on &s;uch trifling que&s;tions, was hereby puni&s;hable with ex|communication and bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>But candor requires &s;ome apology to be made for them. Bigotry was not confined to the New England &s;ettlers, it was the characteri&s;tic of the age. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers in New Jer&s;ey, Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, and indeed in mo&s;t of the colonies, prohibited witchcraft under penalty of death; though the laws &s;eem not to have been executed any where except in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. But the &s;ame gloomy &s;uper&s;tition reigned in England. The &s;tatutes of Henry VIII. and James I. making witchcraft and &s;orcery felony without benefit of clergy, upon which many per&s;ons &s;uffered death, were not repealed, till the ninth year of George II. or about 1736. Ju&s;t before the re&s;toration in 1660, no le&s;s than thirteen gyp&s;ies were condemned at one Suffolk a&s;&s;izes, and executed.</P>

<P>Mr. Burke points out in what manner the educa|tion of the coloni&s;ts (<HI>See page</HI> 24 <HI>and</HI> 41) contri|buted to <Q REND="inline">"the growth and effect of their untractable &s;pirit,"</Q> and that the &s;tudy of the law, &s;o prevalent in that country, rendered <Q REND="inline">"men acute, inqui&s;itive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, and full of re&s;ources."</Q> He then adverts to the religion of the country (<HI>See page</HI> 23) after which he de&s;cribes the chief branches of their religion, which ought to be remembered as a piece of hi&s;tory, independent of its eloquence. <Q REND="inline">"The Roman Catholic religion,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"is, at lea&s;t, coeval with mo&s;t of the governments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them, and received great favour and every kind of &s;upport from authority. The Church of England was formed from her cradle under the nur&s;ing care of regular government. But the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;ts have &s;prung up in direct oppo|&s;ition to all the ordinary powers of the world, and could ju&s;tify that oppo&s;ition only on a &s;trong claim to natural liberty. Their very exi&s;tence depended on the powerful and unremitted a&s;&s;ertion of that claim. All Prote&s;tanti&s;m, even the mo&s;t cold and pa&s;&s;ive, is a &s;ort of di&s;&s;ent. But the religion mo&s;t prevalent in our northern colonies, is a refinement on the principle of re&s;i&s;tance, it is the diffidence of di&s;&s;ent, and the Prote&s;tanti&s;m of Prote&s;tanti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The religion, under a variety of denominations, agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the &s;pirit of liberty, is predominant in mo&s;t of the north|ern provinces, where the Church of England, not|with&s;tanding its legal rights, is, in reality, no more than a &s;ort of private &s;ect, not compo&s;ing, mo&s;t probably, the tenth of the people. The coloni&s;ts left England when this &s;pirit was high, and in the emigrants was the highe&s;t of all."</Q> He then &s;hews
<PB N="lix" REF="63">
that the &s;pirit of liberty was &s;till more high and haughty in the &s;outhern than in the northern &s;tates, and the rea&s;ons he a&s;&s;igns, in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, are not le&s;s ingenious than true. <Q REND="inline">"It is,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"that in Virginia and the Carolinas, they have a va&s;t multitude of &s;laves. Where this is the ca&s;e in any part of the world, tho&s;e who are free, are by far the mo&s;t proud and jealous of their freedom. Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege. Not &s;eeing there, that freedom, as in countries where it is a common ble&s;|&s;ing, and as broad and general as the air, may be united with much abject toil, with great mi&s;ery, with all the exterior of &s;ervitude, liberty looks, among&s;t them, like &s;omething that is more noble and liberal. I do not mean, Sir, to commend the &s;uperior mo|rality of this &s;entiment, which has, at lea&s;t, as much pride as virtue in it; but I cannot alter the nature of man. The fact is &s;o; and the&s;e people of the &s;outhern colonies are much more &s;trongly, and with an higher and more &s;tubborn &s;pirit, attached to li|berty than tho&s;e to the northward. Such were all the ancient commonwealths; &s;uch were our Gothic ance&s;tors; &s;uch in our days were the Poles; and &s;uch will be all ma&s;ters of &s;laves, who are not &s;laves them&s;elves. In &s;uch a people the haughtine&s;s of domination combines with the &s;pirit of freedom, for|tifies it, and renders it invincible."</Q></P>
<P>He then remarks on the rapid population of the coloni&s;ts (<HI>See page</HI> 11) &s;o rapid that whil&s;t they were di&s;puting about the exaggeration of it, the exagge|ration ended, becau&s;e they grew to it. Having &s;tated what may be called the biography of the Americans, he proceeds to the natural re&s;ources of that country.

It would have &s;erved as a faithful record in which mini&s;ters might learn, that truth, in the end, will prevail over venal majorities. It was thought ad|vi&s;eable, however, to convey the &s;ub&s;tance of it in an addre&s;s to the King, and, if this propo&s;ition had been adopted, perhaps a more re&s;pectful and affec|tionate addre&s;s never was conveyed to the foot of the throne. It will remain as long as the Engli&s;h language la&s;ts, as a monument of the powers and beauties of that tongue, and the u&s;e which the writer

knew how to make of them, independent of the force of the arguments, and the happy manner in which they are arranged. The fir&s;t paragraph is filled with expre&s;&s;ions of unfeigned loyalty, of at|tachment to the &s;overeign, and his true intere&s;t. The &s;econd runs thus:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A &s;ituation without example, nece&s;&s;itates a con|duct without precedent. We are driven in this mode of addre&s;&s;ing your Maje&s;ty, reluctantly, to &s;uper&s;ede tho&s;e forms which, in other circum&s;tances, we &s;hould highly re&s;pect; and regulate our&s;elves by no other rules than tho&s;e of our laws, our rights, and the profound reverence we bear to our &s;ove|reign."</Q></P>
<P>The third contains an apology for the propo&s;ed &s;ece&s;&s;ion, on the grounds of the pre&s;ervation of their (the &s;eceders) honour, and what &s;tood next in their e&s;timation, his Maje&s;ty's good opinion, and for in|flexibly per&s;evering in their di&s;&s;ent from every part of tho&s;e proceedings, on the experience of their mi&s;chief, which they originally gave, from a &s;ure fore&s;ight of their unhappy and inevitable tendency.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We deplore, (&s;ay they) along with your Ma|je&s;ty, the di&s;tractions and di&s;orders which prevail in your empire. But we are convinced, that the di&s;|orders of the people, in the pre&s;ent time, are owing to the u&s;ual and natural cau&s;e of &s;uch di&s;orders at all times&mdash;the mi&s;conduct of government; <HI>that they are owing to plans laid in error, pur&s;ued with ob&s;tinacy, and conducted without wi&s;dom.</HI> We cannot attribute &s;o much to the power of faction at the expence of human nature, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that a combination of men, few in number, not con&s;iderable in rank, of no natural hereditary dependencies, of talents, which, however re&s;pectable, appear to be no way uncom|monly impo&s;ing, &s;hould, by the efforts of their po|licy alone, be able to bring the people of your Ame|rican dominions into the di&s;po&s;ition which has pro|duced the pre&s;ent troubles. We cannot conceive,

that, without &s;ome powerful concurring cau&s;e, any management &s;hould prevail on &s;ome millions of peo|ple di&s;per&s;ed over a whole continent, in thirteen pro|vinces, not only unconnected, but in many particu|lars of religion, manners, government, and local in|tere&s;t, totally different and adver&s;e, voluntarily to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all the profits of indu&s;try, and all the comforts of civil life, added to all the evils of an unequal war, carried on with circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t a&s;perity and rigour. This, Sire, could never have happened but from a general &s;en&s;e of &s;ome grievance, &s;o radical in its nature, and &s;o &s;preading in its effects, as to poi&s;on all the ordinary &s;atisfactions of life, to di&s;locate the frame of &s;ociety, and to convert into fear and hatred that habitual reverence ever paid by mankind to an ancient and venerable government.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That grievance is as &s;imple in its nature, and as level to the mo&s;t ordinary under&s;tanding, as it is powerful in affecting the mo&s;t languid pa&s;&s;ions. It is an attempt made to di&s;po&s;e of the whole property of a whole people, without their con&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>Having depreciated this &s;cheme &s;et up in direct op|po&s;ition to the rooted and inveterate prejudices of the whole people of America, they proceed to the following reflections, highly worthy the con&s;ideration of every &s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;en&s;e of a whole people, mo&s;t gracious So|vereign, never ought to be contemned by wi&s;e and beneficent rulers, whatever may be the ab&s;tract claims, or even rights <HI>of the &s;upreme power.</HI> We have been too early in&s;tructed, and too long habituated to be|lieve, that the only firm &s;eat of all authority, is in the minds, affections, and intere&s;ts of the people, to change our &s;entiments for the convenience of a temporary arrangement of &s;tate. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with equity or wi&s;dom, to &s;et at defiance the general feelings of great communities, and all the orders which compo&s;e them. Much power is tolerated, and

pa&s;&s;es unque&s;tioned, where much is yielded to opi|nion. All is di&s;puted, where every thing is enforced. This is the tenet we hold on the duty and policy of conforming to the prejudices of a whole people, even where the foundation of &s;uch prejudices may be fal&s;e or di&s;putable. But, permit us to lay at your Maje&s;ty's feet, our deliberate judgment on the real merits of <HI>that</HI> principle, the violation of which is the known ground and origin of the&s;e troubles. We a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that, on our parts, we &s;hould think our&s;elves unworthy of life, which we only value for the means of &s;pending it in honour and virtue, if we ever &s;ubmitted to taxes, to which we did not con&s;ent, either directly, or by a repre&s;entation <HI>&s;ati&s;|factory</HI> to the body of the people. And we add, Sire, that if fortune, in&s;tead of ble&s;&s;ing us with a &s;ituation where we may have daily acce&s;s to the propitious pre&s;ence of a gracious prince, had fixed us in &s;ettle|ments on the remote&s;t part of the globe, we mu&s;t carry the&s;e &s;entiments with us, as part of our being; per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ded, that the di&s;tance of &s;ituation would only render this privilege the more nece&s;&s;ary, in the di&s;|po&s;al of property. Abu&s;es of &s;ubordinate authority increa&s;e, and all means of redre&s;s le&s;&s;en, as the di&s;|tance of the &s;ubject removes him from the &s;eat of the &s;upreme power. What, in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, can &s;ave him from the la&s;t extremes of indignity and op|pre&s;&s;ion, but &s;omething left in his own hands, which may enable him to conciliate the favour, and controul the exce&s;&s;es of government? When no means are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power to awe, or to oblige, the &s;tronge&s;t ties which connect mankind in every relation, &s;ocial and civil, and which teach them mutually to re&s;pect each other, are broken. Independency, from that moment, virtually exi&s;ts. Its formal declaration will quickly follow. Such mu&s;t be our feelings for our|&s;elves. We are not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another rule for our brethren. When the late attempt, practically to annihilate that privilege was made, great di&s;orders

and tumults very unhappily and very naturally aro&s;e from it. In this &s;tate of things, we were of opinion, that &s;atisfaction ought in&s;tantly to be given, or that at lea&s;t the puni&s;hment of the di&s;order, ought to be attended with the redre&s;s of the grievance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, whenever a di&s;order ari&s;es from, and is directly connected with a grievance, to confine our|&s;elves to the puni&s;hment of the di&s;order, is to declare again&s;t the rea&s;on and ju&s;tice of the complaint."</Q></P>
<P>Having recapitulated the in&s;truments which mini&s;|ters employed in their unfortunate plan, recour&s;e was had to force, <Q REND="inline">"and we &s;aw a force"</Q> &s;ay they <Q REND="inline">"&s;ent out enough to menace liberty, <HI>but not</HI> to awe re&s;i&s;t|ance; tending to bring odium on the civil power, and contempt on the military; at once to provoke and encourage re&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This mode of proceeding, by har&s;h laws and feeble armies, could not be defended on the principle of mercy and forbearance. For mercy, as we conceive, con&s;i&s;ts not in the weakne&s;s of the means, but in the benignity of the ends. We apprehend, that mild mea&s;ures may be powerfully enforced; and that acts of extreme rigour and inju&s;tice may be attended with as much feeblene&s;s in the execution, as &s;everity in the formation."</Q></P>
<P>The concluding part of this addre&s;s cannot be too highly e&s;teemed by every lover of his king and country, particularly the following pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We deprecate the effect of the doctrines which mu&s;t &s;upport and countenance the government over conquered Engli&s;hmen.

At|tempts will be made, attempts have been made, to ridicule and to argue away this principle, and to in|culcate into the minds of your people other maxims of government, and other grounds of obedience than tho&s;e which have prevailed at and &s;ince the glo|rious

revolution. By degrees, the&s;e doctrines, by being convenient, may grow prevalent; the con&s;e|quence is not certain; but a general change of prin|ciples rarely happens among a people without leading to a change of government.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sire, your throne cannot &s;tand &s;ecure upon the principles of unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or pa&s;&s;ive obedience, on powers exerci&s;ed without the concur|rence of the people to be governed, on acts made in defiance of their prejudices and habits, on acquie&s;|cence procured by foreign mercenary troops, and &s;ecured by &s;tanding armies. The&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly be the foundation of other thrones, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubver&s;ion of your's.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was not to pa&s;&s;ive principles in our ance&s;tors that we owe the honour of appearing before a &s;ove|reign, who cannot feel that he is a prince, without knowing that we ought to be free. The revolution is a departure from the ancient cour&s;e of the de&s;cent of this monarchy. The people re-entered into their original rights, and it was not becau&s;e a po&s;itive law authorized the act, but becau&s;e the freedom and &s;afety of the &s;ubject, the origin and cau&s;e of all laws, required a proceeding paramount and &s;uperior to them. At that ever-memorable and in&s;tructive pe|riod, the letter of the law was &s;uper&s;eded in favour of the &s;ub&s;tance of liberty. To the free choice, therefore, of the people, without either king or par|liament, we owe that happy e&s;tabli&s;hment of which both king and parliament were regenerated.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From that great principle of liberty the&s;e &s;tatutes have originated, which have confirmed and ratified that e&s;tabli&s;hment from which your Maje&s;ty derives your right to rule over us. The&s;e &s;tatutes have not given us our liberties; our liberties have produced them. Every hour of your Maje&s;ty's reign, your title &s;tands upon the very &s;ame foundation on which it was at fir&s;t laid, and we do not know a better on which it can po&s;&s;ibly be placed. Convinced that you
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="77">
cannot have different rights, and a different &s;ecurity in different parts of your dominions, we wi&s;h to lay an even platform for your throne, and to give it an immoveable &s;tability, by laying it on the general freedom of your people, and by &s;ecuring equally to your Maje&s;ty, that confidence and affection in all parts of your dominions, which makes your be&s;t &s;ecurity and deare&s;t title in this chief &s;eat of your empire.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Such, Sire, being among&s;t us the foundation of the monarchy it&s;elf, much more clearly and pecu|liarly is it the ground of all parliamentary power. Parliament is a &s;ecurity provided for the protection of freedom, and not a &s;ubtle fiction contrived to amu&s;e the people in its place; and the authority of both Hou&s;es can &s;till le&s;s than that of the Crown be &s;upported upon different principles, or different places, &s;o as to be for one part of your &s;ubjects a protector of liberty, and for another a fund of de&s;|poti&s;m, by which prerogative is extended by occa|&s;ional powers, whenever an arbitrary will finds it&s;elf &s;treightened by the re&s;trictions of law."</Q></P>
<P>This addre&s;s, which may be con&s;idered as the creed of the Rockingham party, was not carried into effect. Mr. Burke was, however, determined that it &s;hould meet the public eye in &s;ome form or other. He there|for transfu&s;ed the &s;pirit of it, in a letter which he addre&s;&s;ed to John Farr and John Harris, E&s;quires, Sheriffs of Bri&s;tol, on the affairs of America in 1777. No man but him&s;elf, perhaps, could have transfu&s;ed that &s;pirit with &s;o much art, for every &s;ubject &s;eemed to be as obedient to his touch as the clay to the pla&s;tic hand of the potter; in &s;hort, his pen, on almo&s;t every occa&s;ion, may be compared to the fabled wand of the old magicians.</P>
<P>Attempts were made to drag even the private cha|racters of tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed the American war through all the filth and dirt of the mini&s;terial prints. Mr. Burke, in this letter, defends tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="78">
tho&s;e ruinous mea&s;ures. He conceived that it would be happy for us, if the coloni&s;ts were taught to be|lieve, that there was even a formed American party in England, to whom they could look for &s;upport. <Q REND="inline">"Happy would it be for us, if in all tempers, they might turn their eyes to the parent &s;tate, &s;o that their very turbulence and &s;edition &s;hould find vent in no other place than this."</Q> He then comes to his own defence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am charged with being an American. If warm affection towards tho&s;e over whom I claim any &s;hare of authority, be a crime, I am guilty of this charge. But I do a&s;&s;ure you (and they who know me publicly and privately well bear witne&s;s to me) that if ever one man lived, more zealous than another, for the &s;upremacy of parliament, and the rights of this im|perial crown, it was my&s;elf. Many others, indeed, might be more knowing in the extent of the founda|tion of the&s;e rights. I do not pretend to be an anti|quary, a lawyer, or qualified for the chair of pro|fe&s;&s;or in metaphy&s;ics. I never ventured to put your &s;olid intere&s;ts upon &s;peculative grounds. My having con&s;tantly declined to do &s;o has been attributed to my incapacity for &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions; and I am in|clined to believe it is partly the cau&s;e. I never &s;hall be a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that where I am ignorant I am diffident. I am, indeed, not very &s;olicitous to clear my&s;elf of this imputed incapacity; becau&s;e men, even le&s;s conver&s;ant than I am, in this kind of &s;ubtleties, and placed in &s;tations, to which I ought not to a&s;pire, have, by the mere force of civil di&s;|cretion, often conducted the affairs of great nations with di&s;tingui&s;hed felicity and glory."</Q></P>
<P>Having given his opinion on the then &s;tate of public affairs," <Q REND="inline">"I feel warmly,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"on this &s;ubject, and expre&s;s my&s;elf as I feel. I am too old, too &s;tiff, in my inveterate partialities, to be ready at all the fa&s;hionable evolutions of opinion. I &s;carce know how to adapt my mind to the feelings with

which the court gazettes mean to impre&s;s the people. It is not in&s;tantly that I can be brought to rejoice, when I hear of the &s;laughter and captivity of long li&s;ts of tho&s;e names, which have been familiar to my ears from my infancy, and to rejoice that they have fallen under the &s;word of &s;trangers, who&s;e barbarous appellations I &s;carcely know how to pronounce. The glory acquired at the white plains by Colonel Roaille, has no charms for me; and I fairly acknowledge, that I have not yet learned to delight in finding Fort Kniphau&s;en in the heart of the Briti&s;h dominions."</Q> In other in&s;tances, as often as he touched on German mercenaries, his warmth kindled into indignation, his pa&s;&s;ions flew to arms, and, in the conflict, it was &s;eldom that the petty princes of Germany them&s;elves, e&s;caped with a &s;tring of epithets as long as their titles.</P>
<P>Towards the conclu&s;ion of this letter, the writer combats, with great force and eloquence, the doctrine which every venal mini&s;ter has endeavoured to di&s;&s;e|minate, namely, <Q REND="inline">"that every man has his price;"</Q> that the reader may judge for him&s;elf, we &s;hall lay an ex|tract of the pa&s;&s;age before him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The common cant is no ju&s;tification for taking this party (his own.) I have been deceived, &s;ay they, by Titius and Maevius; I have been the dupe of this pretender, or of that mountebank; and I can tru&s;t appearances no longer. But my credulity and want of di&s;cernment cannot, as I conceive, amount to a fair pre&s;umption again&s;t any man's integrity. A con&s;cientious per&s;on would rather doubt his own judgment, than condemn his &s;pecies. He would &s;ay, I have ob&s;erved without attention, or judged upon erroneous maxims; I tru&s;ted to profe&s;&s;ion, when I ought to have attended to conduct. Such a man will grow wi&s;e, not malignant, by his acquaintance with the world. But he that accu&s;es all mankind of corruption, ought to remember, that he is &s;ure to convict only one. In truth, I &s;hould rather admit tho&s;e whom at any time I have di&s;reli&s;hed the mo&s;t, to be patterns
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="80">
of perfection, than &s;eek a con&s;olation to my own unworthine&s;s, in a general communion of depravity with all about me.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That this illnatured doctrine &s;hould be preached by the mi&s;&s;ionaries of a court I do not wonder. It an&s;wers their purpo&s;e. But that it &s;hould be heard among tho&s;e who pretend to be &s;trong a&s;&s;erters of liberty, is not only &s;urpri&s;ing, but hardly natural. This moral levelling is a &s;ervile principle. It leads to practical pa&s;&s;ive obedience, far better than all the doctrines which the pliant accommodation of theo|logy to power has ever produced."</Q></P>
<P>This letter found a ready reception with tho&s;e who were already di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to the contents of it; they did not fail to magnify it as a piece of &s;ound political rea&s;oning and manly &s;en&s;e&mdash;It was read with great avidity by all parties.

<P>An increa&s;e of the civil li&s;t was the next que&s;tion agitated in the Commons.

<P>On the return of the Speaker, he received the thanks of the Hou&s;e for his &s;peech, and it was ordered to be printed. Mr. Burke, &s;peaking of it to a friend, &s;aid, that the con&s;titutional &s;entiments which it contained were only equalled by the dignity of the manner in which they were delivered.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Burke had lived in the warme&s;t friend&s;hip with the majority of his con&s;tituents; they approved his parliamentary conduct; and this, if we may tru&s;t his own words, was the highe&s;t meed he looked for; but a period was now at hand that was to put that mutual friend&s;hip to trial. He had taken a decided part in the &s;upport of two bills relative to the trade of Ireland in 1778, the truth is, he only attempted to awaken the long neglected Iri&s;h harp, every &s;tring of which had been once in tune<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis mentions the pro&s;perous &s;tate of Ireland in his days, which he a&s;cribed to the <Q REND="inline">"encouragement given to the maritime towns and cities, as well to encrea&s;e the trade of mer|chandize, as to cheri&s;h mechanical arts,"</Q> and the con&s;equence of which was, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"that the &s;trings or the Iri&s;h harps were all in tune."</Q></NOTE>, not at the expence of the Briti&s;h lyre, but that the notes of both might flow into all <Q REND="inline">"the concord of &s;weet &s;ounds,"</Q> and that the hearts of both nations might dance to the mu&s;ic, but his endeavours were not taken in this point of view, the re&s;ult of which was, that he wrote a letter to Samuel Span, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Society of Merchants Adventurers of Bri&s;tol,</HI> in which he vin|dicated
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="82">
his conduct, and pointed out the advantages that his con&s;tituents would reap from the adoption of even a more liberal &s;y&s;tem of commerce, and that under this conviction he had given it all the &s;upport in his power. The language was plain; he knew that he was addre&s;&s;ing it to a body of men, the major part of whom did not place &s;o high a value upon tropes and figures as they did upon the &s;hining toys and trinkets which they exported to the coa&s;ts of Africa.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;aw that America was on the verge of being lo&s;t, and he wi&s;hed to find an America nearer home. He de&s;cribes the &s;tate of England, at that period, in the&s;e lines:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps Gentlemen are not yet fully aware of the &s;ituation of their country, and what its exigencies ab&s;olutely require.

We are threatened by enemies of no &s;mall magnitude, whom, if we think fit, we may de&s;pi&s;e, as we have de&s;pi&s;ed others; but they are enemies who can only cea&s;e to be truly formidable, by our entertaining a due re&s;pect for their power.

<P>Having lamented that his conduct had given his con&s;tituents any unea&s;ine&s;s, he declares, that he would much rather run the ri&s;que of di&s;plea&s;ing than injur|ing them. <Q REND="inline">"If I am driven,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"to make &s;uch an option, you obligingly lament, that you are not to have me for your advocate; but if I had been capable of acting as an advocate in oppo&s;ition to a plan &s;o perfectly con&s;onant to my known principles, and to the opinions I had publicly declared on an hundred occa&s;ions, I &s;hould only di&s;grace my&s;elf, without &s;upporting, with the &s;malle&s;t degree of credit or effect, the cau&s;e you wi&s;hed me to undertake.

<P>When Mr. Burke found that mini&s;ters were deter|mined to per&s;evere in one of the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous wars in which this country was ever engaged, and that the people began to bend beneath the weight of taxes, he re&s;olved to &s;ee if it was po&s;&s;ible to render the public any &s;ervice. It &s;truck him that there was one path in which he might move with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s, and that was oeconomy. He had attempted it before, and failed, but he was determined to re|turn to the attack with additional force. The mi|ni&s;ter &s;aw that it was a popular mea&s;ure, and capable of great modification. Accordingly, on the 11th of February, 1780, he brought in a bill for <Q REND="inline">"the regu|lation of his Maje&s;ty's civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, and of certain public offices; for the limitations of pen&s;ions, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;undry u&s;ele&s;s, expen&s;ive, and inconvenient places, and for applying the monies &s;aved thereby to the public &s;ervice."</Q> This bill was not &s;o formidable in its contents as in its title, and the Honourable mover took care to &s;often the rigid features of it in a &s;peech of con&s;iderable length. Lord North received it with great &s;eeming cordi|ality. He a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, that no member in it was more zealous for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a perma|nent &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy than him&s;elf; but, as among the various &s;ubjects treated of, &s;ome of them re&s;pected the King's patrimonial income, he thought the crown ought to be con&s;ulted before the bill was admitted. Colonel Barr&eacute; pa&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t enco|miums
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="85">
on the ability, a&s;&s;iduity, exten&s;ive knowledge and comprehen&s;ive genius of his honourable friend Mr. Burke. The late Lord George Gordon thought the hou&s;e ought not to entertain it, and though he &s;tood alone, divided the hou&s;e upon it. Mr. Burke hailed this as a lucky omen, but was prudent enough to keep within the limits, which he had pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf in the out&s;et. It was not his intention even to attempt to clean&s;e the augean &s;table, or to pluck up corruption by the root, that very corruption which he him&s;elf called the dry-rot of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject was apparently barren, and it was not expected that even Mr. Burke could enliven it, but the hou&s;e was very agreeably di&s;appointed&mdash;in his hand it became &s;o fertile, that to continue the meta|phor it &s;hot in many places into luxuriancy. In the cour&s;e of his &s;peech it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould point out the u&s;e and abu&s;e of certain offices, this was a point of great per&s;onal delicacy, in which he was very &s;ucce&s;sful; &s;peaking of the nece&s;&s;ity of the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure, his words are worthy of remem|brance. <Q REND="inline">"There is a time,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"when men will not &s;uffer bad things, becau&s;e their ance&s;tors have &s;uffered wor&s;e. There is a time, when the hoary head of inveterate abu&s;e will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection."</Q></P>
<P>The king of France at that time had &s;eriou&s;ly turned his attention to a reform in the finances of his country, joined to a reform in his court.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the edict of the king of France, regi&s;tered the 26th of Augu&s;t, <HI>four hundred and &s;ix</HI> places in this court were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> Mr. Burke took notice of this, and de&s;canted on it in the following &s;train: <Q REND="inline">"The Mini&s;ter, (Neckar) who does the&s;e things, is a great man,&mdash;but the king, who de|&s;ires that they &s;hould be done, is a far greater.

&s;pirit of its brave and numerous nobility: I am not alarmed even at the great navy which has been &s;o miraculou&s;ly created. All the&s;e things Louis the fourteenth had before. With all the&s;e things, the French monarchy has more than once fallen pro&s;|trate at the feet of the public faith of Great Britain. It was the want of public credit which di&s;abled France from recovering after her defeats, or recovering even from her victories and triumphs. It was a prodigal court, it was an ill-ordered revenue, that &s;apped the foundations of all her greatne&s;s. Credit cannot exi&s;t under the arm of nece&s;&s;ity. Nece&s;&s;ity &s;trikes at credit, I allow, with a heavier and quicker blow under an arbitrary monarchy, than under a limited and ba|lanced government: but &s;till nece&s;&s;ity and credit are natural enemies, and cannot be long reconciled in any &s;ituation.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From nece&s;&s;ity and corruption, a free &s;tate may lo&s;e the &s;pirit of that complex con&s;titution which is the foundation of confidence. On the other hand, I am far from being &s;ure, that a monarchy, when once it is properly regulated, may not for a long time, furni&s;h a foundation for credit upon the &s;olidity of its maxims, though it affords no ground of tru&s;t in its in&s;titutions. I am afraid I &s;ee in England, and in France, &s;omething like a beginning of both the&s;e things. I wi&s;h I may be found in a mi&s;take."</Q></P>
<P>There are many pa&s;&s;ages in this &s;peech highly worthy the attention of the patriotic &s;tate&s;man, as long as oeconomy is to be con&s;idered what it has been found&mdash;the be&s;t mine in every nation. Gravity and gaiety, perhaps, were never more happily united in any &s;peech or compo&s;ition. The Revenue Adven|tures of Knight Probert, (&s;ee p. 253,) and the Mu|tiny of the Hou&s;hold Troops, (&s;ee p. 111,) are &s;pe|cimens of the latter, the fir&s;t is written in all the &s;pirit of romance, and the &s;econd threw the hou&s;e into frequent bur&s;ts of laughter, which induced Lord North to whi&s;per, that &s;uch was the ver&s;ality of Mr.

Burke's powers, that if he were to &s;peak of an old almanack, he could &s;et all the planets in the &s;ame humourous commotion. Having unfolded part of his plan, he called on the hou&s;e to do him ju&s;tice, if it did not tend to aboli&s;h offices more expen&s;ive than u&s;eful, to combine duties improperly &s;eparated, to change revenues more vexatious than productive, into ready money, to &s;uppre&s;s offices which &s;tood in the way of oeconomy, and to cut off lurking &s;ubor|dinate trea&s;urers. Mr. Burke, in a letter to a noble Lord, in 1796, &s;peaks of this mea&s;ure thus: <Q REND="inline">"My oeconomical reforms were not the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a paltry pen&s;ion or employment more or le&s;s. Oeco|nomy in my plan was, as it ought to be, &s;econdary, &s;ubordinate, in&s;trumental. I acted on &s;tate princi|ples. I found a great di&s;temper in the common|wealth; and, according to the nature of the evil and the object, I treated it. The malady was deep; it was complicated, in the cau&s;es and in the &s;ymptoms. Throughout it was full of contraindicants. On one hand government, daily growing more invidious for an apparent increa&s;e of the means of &s;trength, was every day growing more contemptible by real weak|ne&s;s. Nor was this di&s;&s;olution confined to govern|ment commonly &s;o called. It extended to parliament; which was lo&s;ing not a little in it's dignity and e&s;ti|mation, by an opinion of it's not acting on worthy motives.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A complaint was made of too much influence in the Hou&s;e of Commons, I reduced it in both Hou&s;es; and I gave my rea&s;ons article by article for every reduction, and &s;hewed why I thought it &s;afe for the &s;ervice of the &s;tate. I heaved the lead every inch of way I made."</Q></P>
<P>The parliament was &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olved on the fir&s;t of September, 1780. Mr. Burke had now faithfully &s;erved his con&s;tituents &s;ix years&mdash;yet &s;trange as it may appear, when the fame of his integrity and his talents went hand in hand, and was daily increa&s;ing, that
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="88">
his popularity &s;hould be on the decline in Bri&s;tol, and it is probable that he would not have offered him&s;elf a &s;econd time to the choice of the electors of that city, if it were not out of re&s;pect to many worthy characters among&s;t the Quakers and Di&s;&s;enters in it, who promi&s;ed him their &s;upport, and acted up to their promi&s;e. He accordingly appeared on the hu&s;tings at Guildhall, in Bri&s;tol, with all the open|ne&s;s and becoming confidence of a man who was con&s;cious that he had di&s;charged his duty. The meeting was uncommonly numerous on that occa|&s;ion. Three candidates offered them&s;elves at the &s;ame time. Mr. Burke, in his turn, addre&s;&s;ed the audience in a &s;peech replete with arguments, con|veyed in the mo&s;t eloquent language, in which he defended his parliamentary conduct. <Q REND="inline">"If you call upon me,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;olicit the favour of the city upon manly ground. I come before you with the plain confidence of an hone&s;t &s;ervant in the equity of a candid and di&s;cerning ma&s;ter.

I have lived too long to be &s;erved by apologies, or to &s;tand in need of them. The part I have acted has been in open day; and to hold out to a conduct, which &s;tands in that clear and &s;teady light for all its good and all its evil, to hold out to that conduct, the paltry winking tapers of excu&s;es and promi&s;es&mdash;I never will do it.&mdash;They may ob|&s;cure it with their &s;moke; but they never can illu|mine &s;un&s;hine by &s;uch a flame as theirs."</Q></P>
<P>One of the charges exhibited again&s;t him was the part which he took in Lord Beauchamp's bill for reforming the law proce&s;s for impri&s;onment for debt (<HI>See Act of Grace, page</HI> 1.) The next was his con|currence in the repeal of certain penal laws again&s;t the Roman Catholics. His defence, on this head, was grounded on the laws of humanity, the &s;ounde&s;t maxims of policy and ju&s;tice, and on the&s;e points,

perhaps, no man ever &s;hone to &s;uch advantage.

<P>The part which he took relative to the trade of Ireland gave offence. All commercial maxims are &s;elfi&s;h and narrow. He did not wi&s;h to &s;ee the noble tide of Briti&s;h trade &s;lumber on oozy beds, or creep through crooked channels; he wi&s;hed to &s;ee it flow as bountifully as the ocean it&s;elf, &s;o that the &s;i&s;ter kingdoms might mutually partake of its ble&s;&s;ings. He was al&s;o charged with having voted contrary to the in&s;tructions of his con&s;tituents. This was a ground on which he defended him&s;elf with uncom|mon addre&s;s. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he knew that he had been cho&s;en in his place, along with others, to be a pillar of the State, and not a weather-cock on the top of the edifice, exalted for his levity and ver&s;atility, and of no u&s;e but to indicate the &s;hiftings of every fa&s;hion|able gale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;imilar charge was exhibited again&s;t Thomas Bourn, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Member of the American Convention, in con&s;equence of which he addre&s;&s;ed his con&s;tituents in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"Fellow town&s;men, the line of conduct which has appeared to me right, I have ever wi&s;hed to pur&s;ue.

It is true, my &s;entiments, at pre&s;ent, are not in favour of the con&s;titution (Ame|rican); open, however, to conviction, they may be very different when the &s;ubject is fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by able and upright men. To place my&s;elf in a &s;ituation, where conviction could only be followed by a bigotted per&s;i&s;tance in error, would be extremely di&s;agreeable to me.

<P>I decline the election.&mdash;It has ever been my rule through life, to ob&s;erve a proportion between my efforts and my objects. I have never been re|markable

for a bold, active, and &s;anguine pur&s;uit of advantages that are per&s;onal to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have not canva&s;&s;ed the whole of this city in form. But I have taken &s;uch a view of it, as &s;atisfies my own mind, that your choice will not ultimately fall upon me. Your city, Gentlemen, is in a &s;tate of mi&s;erable di&s;traction; and I am re|&s;olved to withdraw whatever &s;hare my preten&s;ions may have had in its unhappy divi&s;ions. I have not been in ha&s;te; I have tried all prudent means; I have waited for the effect of all contingencies. If I were fond of a conte&s;t, by the partiality of my numerous friends (whom ye know to be among the mo&s;t weighty and re&s;pectable people of the city) I have the means of a &s;harp one in my hands. But I thought it far better, with my &s;trength un&s;pent, and my reputation unimpaired, to do, early and from fore&s;ight, that which I might be obliged to do from nece&s;&s;ity at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I am not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, nor in the lea&s;t angry, at this view of things. I have read the book of life for a long time, and I have read other books a little. Nothing has happened to me, but what has happened to men much better than me, and in times and in nations full as good as the age and country we live in. To &s;ay that I am no way concerned would be neither decent nor true. The repre&s;entation of Bri&s;tol was an object on many accounts dear to me: and I certainly &s;hould very far prefer it to any other in the kingdom. My habits are made to it; and it is in general more unplea&s;ant to be rejected, after long trial, than not to be cho&s;en at all.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, I will &s;ee nothing except your former kindne&s;s, and I will give way to no other &s;en|timents than tho&s;e of gratitude. From the bottom of my heart I thank you for what you have done for me. You have given me a long term, which is now ex|pired. I have performed the conditions, and enjoyed
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="93">
all the profits to the full; and I now &s;urrender your e&s;tate into your hands, without being in a &s;ingle tile, or a &s;ingle &s;tone, impaired or wa&s;ted by my u&s;e. I have &s;erved the public for fifteen years. I have &s;erved you in particular for &s;ix. What is pa&s;&s;ed is well &s;tored. It is &s;afe, and out of the power of for|tune. What is to come, is in wi&s;er hands than ours; and he, in who&s;e hands it is, be&s;t knows whether it is be&s;t for you and me, that I &s;hould be in parliament, or even in the world.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the melancholy event of ye&s;terday<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The death of R.

The worthy gentleman, who has been &s;natched from us at the moment of the election, and in the middle of the conte&s;t, whil&s;t his de&s;ires were as warm, and his hopes as eager as ours, has feelingly told us, what &s;hadows we are, and what &s;hadows we pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>It has been u&s;ual for a candidate who declines, to take his leave by a letter to the Sheriffs; but I re|ceived your tru&s;t in the face of day, and in the face of day I accept your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. I am not,&mdash;I am not at all a&s;hamed to look upon you; nor can my pre&s;ence di&s;compo&s;e the order of bu&s;ine&s;s here. I humbly and re&s;pectfully take my leave of the She|riffs, the Candidates, and the Electors, wi&s;hing hear|tily that the choice may be for the be&s;t, at a time which calls, if ever time did call, for &s;ervice that is not nominal. It is no plaything you are about. I tremble when I con&s;ider the tru&s;t I have pre&s;umed to a&s;k. I confided perhaps too much in my intentions.

<P>But on a calm and very deliberate view of the &s;tate of the city, I am convinced that no other con&s;e|quence can be rea&s;onably expected from my conti|nuing a candidate, than a long, vexatious, and ex|pen&s;ive conte&s;t. Con&s;cious, that no difference be|tween my &s;ervice, and that of any other man, can be worth the inconveniencies of &s;uch a &s;truggle. I decline the election.</P>
<P>I return you my be&s;t thanks for having, at any time, or for any period, conde&s;cended to think of me for your repre&s;entative. I have done my duty towards you, and towards the nation, as became me. You di&s;po&s;e of the future tru&s;t (as you have a right to do) according to your di&s;cretion. We have no cau&s;e of complaint on either &s;ide. By being returned into the ma&s;s of private citizens, my burthens are le&s;&s;ened, my &s;atisfactions are not de&s;troyed. The&s;e are duties to be performed, and there are comforts to be enjoyed in ob&s;curity, for which I am not with|out a di&s;po&s;ition or reli&s;h. I am &s;ure there is nothing

in the retro&s;pect of my public conduct, which is likely to di&s;turb the tranquillity of that &s;ituation, to which you re&s;tore me.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;curity and retirement"</Q> are favourite expre&s;|&s;ions on the lips of every great man, but if Mr. Burke thought that he was &s;ufficiently prepared to throw him&s;elf into the arms of one or the other, he &s;eems to have been little acquainted with his own heart. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom he wi&s;hed to plea&s;e were &s;till alive, the circle of his friends was hourly expanding, and it would have exhibited rather a kind of peevi&s;hne&s;s and ill humour, to throw down his &s;word and buckler, becau&s;e he had lo&s;t one engage|ment, when others of more importance remained to be contended in. His friends exerted every nerve in &s;upport of his cau&s;e, or rather their own, and were determined to di&s;pute every inch of ground to the la&s;t, but he did not wi&s;h to put them to that trouble&mdash;he declined&mdash;and retired amid&s;t the plau|dits of even tho&s;e who had not voted for him, and though he lo&s;t the election, it may be fairly &s;aid that he gained the victory.</P>
<P>Having made his election for Malton, he conti|nued to attack Mini&s;ters &s;ometimes with a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of language, which many of his friends reprobated, and which Lord North u&s;ed to call the lava of Mr. Burke's eloquence.</P>
<P>Much about this time the nece&s;&s;ity of a parlia|mentary reform was contended for, as e&s;&s;ential to the &s;alvation of the con&s;titution. A committee was ap|pointed in York&s;hire, in order to take this important &s;ubject into con&s;ideration; a &s;imilar committee was about to be appointed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e in Buck|ingham&s;hire.
<PB N="xcii" REF="96">
Mr. Burke addre&s;&s;ed a letter to a gentleman of that county, in which he gave his opi|nion on this weighty matter, the following extracts are taken from it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The country will, in &s;ome way or other, be called upon to declare it your opinion, that the Hou&s;e of Commons is not &s;ufficiently numerous, and that the elections are not &s;ufficiently frequent. That an hundred new knights of the &s;hire ought to be added; and that we are to have a new election, once in three years for certain, and as much oftener as the King plea&s;es. Such will be the &s;tate of things, if the propo&s;itions made &s;hall take effect.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"All this may be proper; but as an hone&s;t man, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly give my vote for it, until I have con&s;idered it more fully. I will not deny, that our con&s;titution may have faults, and that tho&s;e faults, when found, ought to be corrected. It is not every thing which appears at fir&s;t view to be faulty, in &s;uch a very complicated plan as our con&s;titution. To enable us to correct the con&s;titution, the whole con|&s;titution mu&s;t be viewed together, and it mu&s;t be compared with the actual con&s;titution of the people, and the circum&s;tances of the time. For that, which taken &s;ingly, and by it&s;elf may appear to be wrong, when con&s;idered with relation to other things may be perfectly right, or at lea&s;t &s;uch as ought to be pa|tiently endured, as the means of preventing &s;omething that is much wor&s;e. So far with regard to what, at fir&s;t view, may appear a <HI>di&s;temper</HI> in the con&s;titution. As to the <HI>remedy</HI> of that di&s;temper, an equal caution ought to be u&s;ed; becau&s;e this latter con&s;ideration is not &s;ingle and &s;eparate, no more than the former. There are many things in reformation, which would be proper to be done, if other things can be done along with them, but which, if they cannot be &s;o accompanied, ought not to be done at all. I there|fore wi&s;h, when any deep matter of this new nature

is propo&s;ed to me, to have the whole &s;cheme di&s;|tinctly in my view, and full time to con&s;ider of it. Plea&s;e God, I will walk with caution, whenever I am not able to &s;ee my way clearly before me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am now growing old. I have from very early youth been conver&s;ant in reading and thinking upon the &s;ubjects of our laws and con&s;titution, as well upon tho&s;e of other times and other countries. I have been for fifteen years a very laborious Member of Parliament, and in that time have had great op|portunities of &s;eeing with my own eyes the working of the machine of our government; of remarking where it went &s;moothly, and did its bu&s;ine&s;s, and where it checked in its movements, or where it da|maged its work. I have al&s;o had, and u&s;ed the op|portunities of conver&s;ing with men of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, and fulle&s;t experience in the&s;e matters; and I do declare to you mo&s;t &s;olemnly and mo&s;t truly, that on the re&s;ult of all this reading, thinking, expe|rience and communication, I am not able to come to an immediate re&s;olution in &s;avour of a change in the ground-work of our con&s;titution; and in parti|cular, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the country, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our repre&s;entation, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our modes and rights of electing, in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;everal prevalent intere&s;ts, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the affairs and manners of this country, I am not able to vote that the addition of the hun|dred knights of the &s;hire, and the hurrying of election on election, will be things advantageous, either to liberty or to good government.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h that the deliberative &s;en&s;e of the kingdom on this great &s;ubject &s;hould be known. When it is known it mu&s;t be prevalent. It would be dreadful, indeed, if there were any power in the nation capable of re&s;i&s;ting its unanimous de&s;ire, or even the de&s;ire of any great or very decided majo|rity of the people. The people may be deceived in
<PB N="xciv" REF="98">
their choice of an object, but I can &s;carcely conceive that any choice they can make to be &s;o very mi&s;|chievous, as the exi&s;tence of any human force capa|ble of re&s;i&s;ting it. It will certainly be the duty of every man, in the &s;ituation to which God has called him, to give his be&s;t opinion and advice upon the matter; it will <HI>not</HI> be his duty (let him think what he will) to u&s;e any violent or fraudulent means of counteracting the general wi&s;h, or even of employing the <HI>legal and con&s;tructive</HI> organ of expre&s;&s;ing the peo|ple's &s;en&s;e again&s;t the &s;en&s;e which they &s;o <HI>actually</HI> entertained."</Q></P>
<P>Towards the conclu&s;ion of the year 1781, Mr. Burke, and &s;everal characters in the nation, pre|eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by their rank and patrioti&s;m, their riches and their influence, were applied to from a quarter where the &s;ources of a &s;ecret and important intelligence were as indubitable as the readine&s;s to communicate. It was fervent and un&s;ullied, a variety of delicate circum&s;tances (of which not the lea&s;t cogent is the pre&s;ent exi&s;tence of &s;everal of the illu&s;|trious parties concerned) forbids us to expatiate on the &s;ubject, whil&s;t we lament that we are compelled to allude to it in an exceedingly abridged &s;tatement. Re|pre&s;entations had been made, which, had they been fol|lowed up with unanimous energy and per&s;everance, would, in all probability, have prevented the di&s;mem|berment of America from Great Britain. What were the an&s;wers of other individuals to an awful and pre&s;&s;ing requi&s;ition mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed over. We can almo&s;t verbally affirm, that the delivered opinion of Mr. Burke was, <Q REND="inline">"that he did not entertain the lea&s;t doubt of the truth of the information, but that all his en|deavours in con&s;equence of it would prove fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e the admini&s;tration explicitly manife&s;ted a rivetted determination to pur&s;ue the &s;ame mea&s;ures until they &s;hould become quite annihilated by their po&s;itive inability to continue the war again&s;t the colonies."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xcv" REF="99">On the 28th of March, 1782, Lord North a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, on <HI>authority,</HI> that the <HI>pre&s;ent admini&s;tration was no more!</HI> and that for the purpo&s;e of giving the nece&s;&s;ary time for new arrangements, he moved an adjournment, which was in&s;tantly agreed to. The arrangements were as follow: The Marquis of Rock|ingham Fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, the Earl of Shel|burne and Mr. Fox joint Secretaries of State, Lord Camden Pre&s;ident of the Council, Duke of Grafton Privy Seal, Lord John Cavendi&s;h Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Burke Payma&s;ter-General of the Forces.</P>
<P>A few days after Mr. Burke was made a Privy Coun&s;ellor.</P>
<P>The dawn of the new admini&s;tration promi&s;ed a refulgent day. The leading members of it had pledged them&s;elves to many regulations and reforms, which they began to carry into execution as &s;oon as the parliament met, with a degree of alacrity and liberality unknown in the parliamentary hi&s;tory of this country. The integrity and judgment of the Marquis of Rock|ingham ju&s;tly exalted him in the opinion of the nation, but at the very in&s;tant that his bleeding country leaned on his hone&s;t heart, it plea&s;ed the King of Kings to call him to him&s;elf. This illu&s;|trious patriot expired on the fir&s;t of July, 1782, of a complaint with which he had been long afflicted&mdash;(the hydrothorax) and which had latterly very much encrea&s;ed, from his unremitting attention to public bu&s;ine&s;s. His lo&s;s was felt and deplored by the whole nation. Mr. Burke drew his character when living, (<HI>See page</HI> 484) and little did he think, perhaps, at the time, that he &s;hould be &s;o &s;oon called on to pay the la&s;t &s;ad tribute to his memory, which he did in the following in&s;cription, for the mau&s;oleum erected in Wentworth Park, and in which Earl Fitzwilliam has al&s;o placed a bu&s;t of the writer of it.</P>

<P><PB N="xcvii" REF="101">On the death of Lord Rockingham, Lord Shel|burne (now Marquis of Land&s;downe) was appointed Fir&s;t Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury; and this giving umbrage to the Rockingham part of the cabi|net, who &s;tates, <Q REND="inline">"that by this change the mea&s;ures of the former admini&s;tration would be broken in upon,"</Q> Mr. Fox, Lord John Cavendi&s;h, Mr. Burke, and others, re&s;igned their re&s;pective offices, when Mr. Pitt &s;ucceeded Lord John Cavendi&s;h as Chan|cellor of the Exchequer, the pre&s;ent Lord Sydney Mr. Fox, as Secretary of State, and Colonel Barr&eacute; Mr. Burke, as Payma&s;ter-General of the Forces.</P>
<P>By this change Mr. Burke fell once more into the ranks of oppo&s;ition, and continued &s;o till after the peace of 1783. We have now followed Mr. Burke to this period, and it was ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to follow him, as the road was direct, and he was always found in the middle of it, and though there were alluring pro&s;pects on either &s;ide, he was never known to be drawn a&s;ide from the rugged path of virtue and in|tegrity.</P>
<P>He had travelled this road many years, and was never known to faint or lag in the dreary journey, with many companions, it is true; rich in worth, rich in wealth, but Mr. Burke was only rich in fame, and he had a &s;on, the centre of his affections.

The re&s;ult of this junction of parties was, that the Duke of Portland was placed at the head of the Trea&s;ury, Lord John Cavendi&s;h re&s;umed his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord North and Mr. Fox were appointed Secretaries of State, Mr.

<P>On the 18th of November, 1783, Mr. Fox moved for leave to bring in his Ea&s;t-India Bill; leave was given, and on the fir&s;t of December following, when the que&s;tion was put, that the Speaker <Q REND="inline">"do now leave the chair,"</Q> after &s;ome oppo&s;ition to it, Mr. Burke ro&s;e, and defended the principles of the bill in a &s;peech, in which it may almo&s;t be &s;aid, that he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in brilliancy of language and rich|ne&s;s of argument; it would not fall &s;hort of a com|pari&s;on with India it&s;elf&mdash;&s;uch dominion of mind, &s;uch gra&s;p of thought&mdash;&s;uch powers of de&s;cription&mdash;and &s;o intimate a knowledge of the &s;ubject, that every &s;cene &s;eemed to be the effect of magic in&s;tead of oratory. The peroration is the fine&s;t in any lan|guage, for it was the character of his friend Mr. Fox (<HI>See page</HI> 461)&mdash;
<Q><L>Warm from the &s;oul, and faithful to its fires.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bill, Mr. Burke noticed particularly a phra&s;e that had frequently been em|ployed (by Mr. W. Pitt) with a view of exciting odium again&s;t the bill and its promoters, viz. <Q REND="inline">"the chartered rights of men."</Q> The phra&s;e, he ob&s;erved, was full of affectation and ambiguity. The rights of men, that is, the natural rights of mankind, he &s;aid, were &s;acred things, and if any public mea&s;ure was &s;ound mi&s;chievou&s;ly to affect them, that circum&s;tance ought to be an objection fatal to the mea&s;ure, but that was not the ca&s;e here; the rights the India Com|pany's charters communicated (to &s;peak of them in terms of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible moderation) did, at lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pend the natural rights of mankind, and were liable to fall into a direct violation of them, and it was the ab&s;olute duty of parliament, he added, to guard again&s;t &s;uch violation. A new arrangement of mini&s;ters took place in 1783, when Mr. W. Pitt was appointed Fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><PB N="xcix" REF="103">The next &s;ubject of importance that occupied the parliamentary attention of Mr. Burke was the im|peachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings.

and the right is to be re&s;umed&mdash;that principle which tells him that re&s;i&s;tance to power u&s;urped is not merely a duty which he owes to him&s;elf and to his neighbour, but a duty which he owes to his God, in a&s;&s;erting and maintaining the rank which he gave him in his creation!&mdash;to that common God, who, where he gives the <HI>form</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> whatever may be the complexion, gives al&s;o the <HI>feelings</HI> and the <HI>rights</HI> of <HI>man</HI>&mdash;that principle, which neither the rudene&s;s of ignorance can &s;tifle, nor the enervation of re|finement extingui&s;h!&mdash;that principle which makes it ba&s;e for a man to &s;uffer when he ought to act, which, tending to pre&s;erve to the &s;pecies the original de&s;ig|nations of Providence, &s;purns at the arrogant di&s;|tinction of man, and vindicates the independent qua|lity of his race."</Q> He &s;aid, that it had been a practice with Mr. Ha&s;tings to hold him&s;elf out as a preter|natural being, gifted with good fortune, or el&s;e the peculiar favourite of Heaven, and that Providence never failed to take up and carry, by wife but hidden means, every project of his to its de&s;tined end. In this bla&s;phemous way did the pri&s;oner at the bar libel the cour&s;e of Providence. Thus, according to him, when his corruptions and bribers were on the eve of expo&s;ure, Providence in&s;pired the heart of Nunducomar to commit a low, ba&s;e crime, in order to &s;ave Mr. Ha&s;tings from ruin. Thus, al&s;o, when in his attempts on Cheyt Sing, and his plunder of the Begums, Providence &s;tepped in, and in&s;pired the one with re&s;i&s;tance, and the other with rebellion, to forward his purpo&s;es. Thus did he arrogantly hold him&s;elf forth as a man, not only the favourite of Providence, but as one for who&s;e &s;ake Provi|dence departed from the eternal cau&s;e of its own wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations. Thus did he pre&s;ume to &s;ay that he was honoured and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the admini&s;tration of office by in&s;piring felonies, heaven-born crimes, and providential trea&s;ons! Arraigning that Providence, who&s;e works are goodne&s;s, and who&s;e ways are right.</P>
<P><PB N="ciii" REF="107">Mr. Burke's panegyric on this &s;peech ought not to be omitted; it ran nearly as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He has, this day, &s;urprized the thou&s;ands who hung with rapture on his accents, by &s;uch an array of talents, &s;uch an exhibition of capacity, &s;uch a di&s;play of powers, as are unparalleled in the annals of oratory; a di&s;play that reflected the highe&s;t honor upon him&s;elf&mdash;lu&s;tre upon letters&mdash;renown upon par|liament&mdash;glory upon the country.

<P>Tho&s;e who had never read Mr. Burke's &s;peeches, or heard him &s;peak before, might be ea&s;ily induced to &s;uppo&s;e that he had re&s;erved all the &s;tores of his elo|quence for the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings, &s;o that the beauties of tho&s;e &s;peeches were as countle&s;s as the beauties of the fair that a&s;&s;embled to li&s;ten to them. In the cour&s;e of one of them he &s;tiled Mr. Ha&s;t|ings <Q REND="inline">"The Commander and Captain General of the Enormities in India."</Q> When he conferred this title on him, he took care that it &s;hould not be a mere empty one; he &s;oon furni&s;hed him with abundance

of troops, agents, &amp;c. which he mar&s;halled and de|picted in the mo&s;t artful and eloquent manner. Hav|ing drawn the character of Congo Bulwant Sing (a &s;ecretary employed by Mr. Ha&s;tings) in the blacke&s;t colours, he came to that of Debi Sing, which he painted as one of the greate&s;t villains that ever &s;tained the page of hi&s;tory. <Q REND="inline">"This mon&s;ter,"</Q> or rather this collection of mon&s;ters, according to Mr. Burke, <Q REND="inline">"rai&s;ed the rents of the inhabitants.

This was not &s;ufficient; he &s;old even the very ground de&s;tined for the burial of the owners, and this was to them, from the nature of their edu|cation and religion, the mo&s;t heart-rending of all their lo&s;&s;es. Having robbed the living of their liberty, food, &amp;c. and the dead even of a re&s;ting place, he recollected there was another cla&s;s, the poor pea&s;antry, who, though unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the gratification of his avarice, they could &s;till, however, admini&s;ter to his cruelty.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This inoffen&s;ive race was cruelly tortured; cords were drawn tight round the fingers, until the fle&s;h of the four on each hand was actually incorporated and become one &s;olid ma&s;s; the fingers were then &s;epa|rated by wedges of iron, and wood driven in between them. Others were tied two and two by the feet, and thrown acro&s;s a wooden bar, upon which they hung with their feet uppermo&s;t; they were then beat on the &s;oals of their feet until their toe-nails dropped off.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They were afterwards beat about the head until the blood gu&s;hed out at the mouth, no&s;e, and ears; they were al&s;o flogged upon the naked body with bamboo canes and prickly bu&s;hes, and, above all, with &s;ome poi&s;onous weeds, which were of a mo&s;t cau&s;tic nature, and burnt at every touch.

who had ordered all this, had contrived to tear the mind as well as body; he frequently had a father and a &s;on tied naked to one another by the feet and arms, and then flogged until the &s;kin was torn from the fle&s;h; and he had the devili&s;h &s;atisfaction to know that every blow mu&s;t hurt, for if one e&s;caped the &s;on, his &s;en&s;ibility was wounded by the knowledge he had that the blow had fallen upon his father; when the &s;ame torture was felt by the father, then he knew that every blow that mi&s;&s;ed him had fallen upon his &s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The treatment of the females could not be de|&s;cribed; dragged forth from the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their hou&s;es, which the religion of the country had made for many &s;anctuaries, they were expo&s;ed naked to the public view; the virgins were carried to the court of ju&s;tice, where they might naturally have looked for protection; but now they looked for it in vain, for in the face of the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, in the face of the &s;pectators, in the face of the &s;un, tho&s;e tender and mode&s;t virgins were brutally violated.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The only difference between their treatment and that of the mothers was, that the former were di&s;|honoured in the face of day, the latter in the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of their dungeons.

<P>Here Mr. Burke dropt his head upon his hands, unable to proceed, &s;o greatly was he oppre&s;&s;ed by the horror which he felt at this relation. The effect of it was vi&s;ible through the whole auditory; the late Mrs. Sheridan fainted away, &s;everal ladies &s;unk un|der the agitation of their feelings, among&s;t others Mrs. Siddons. Such a tragedy was never exhibited

on any &s;tage, or delivered in &s;uch impa&s;&s;ionate tones; and when his tongue could no longer perform its office, indignation and pity alternately &s;poke from his brow.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Burke could command all the figures of rhetoric, all the flowers of fancy, all the beauties of poetry, all the fruits of experience, all the axioms, maxims, authorities, and quotations of ancient and modern writers, yet he could not command his temper, nor could he mention Mr. Ha&s;ting's name without adding &s;ome degrading epithet, which he well knew he ought not to do, out of re&s;pect to the Court, and even to him&s;elf. This involved him &s;ometimes in dilemmas which he might have ea&s;ily avoided, if he had followed the gentleman-like con|duct of Mr. Fox, and the re&s;t of the managers. On one of the&s;e occa&s;ions he was rebuked by a right reverend prelate. On the 13th of June, 1793, Mr. Francis de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ended the conduct of Mr. Burke as a manager, and lamented that he who had written &s;o much in favour of a certain cla&s;s of men, did not experience gentler treatment from them; the &s;crip|ture had &s;aid (continued Mr. Francis) <Q REND="inline">"Put not your tru&s;t in princes,"</Q> and if he might take the liberty he would add, nor yet bi&s;hops. Mr. Burke thanked Mr. Francis, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He never did, nor would, put his tru&s;t in great men, nor in little men, but in him that commanded him neither to tru&s;t in the one nor the other."</Q> Mr. Fox, on the opening of the Benares charge, having occa&s;ion to mention Mr. Burke, could not be &s;atisfied with the bare mention of a name that was &s;o dear to him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If we are no longer in &s;hameful ignorance of India,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"if India no longer makes us blu&s;h, in the eyes of Europe, let us know and feel our obligations to him&mdash;who&s;e admirable re&s;ources of opinion and affection, who&s;e untiring toil, &s;ublime genius, and high a&s;piring honour, rai&s;ed him up con|&s;picuous among the mo&s;t beneficent worthies of mankind."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cvii" REF="111">We &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay what was the mo|tive which induced Mr. Burke to become the pub|lic accu&s;er of Mr. Ha&s;tings; but his per&s;everance in the pur&s;uit undoubtedly tended to encrea&s;e his fame, which was then on the decline, and if he had ab&s;tained from all a&s;perity of language to the accu&s;ed, he would have &s;tood in a &s;till fairer point of view with the public; perhaps no man ever exhibited, even in his very countenance, tone, and ge&s;ture, a higher degree of per&s;onal triumph than he did the day after he found him&s;elf in the majority on the que&s;tion of impeachment. Having met one of his friends, he could &s;carce contain him&s;elf with rapture, <Q REND="inline">"This is a proud day for England,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"what a glorious pro&s;pect! her ju&s;tice extending to A&s;ia, her humanity to Africa, her friend&s;hip to America, and her faith and good will to all Europe."</Q></P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the impeachment is &s;o well known, and the whole of the proceedings &s;o amply detailed in various publications, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell any longer on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the debate on the commercial treaty with France, on the 23d of January, 1787, Mr. Burke oppo&s;ed it with his u&s;ual eloquence and violence. Mr. Pitt, he &s;aid, with that narrowne&s;s which leads men of limitted minds to look at great objects in a confined point of view, &s;poke of the tran&s;action as if it was the affair of two little 'compting-hou&s;es, and not of two great nations. He &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as a contention between the &s;ign of the Fleur-de-lis and the &s;ign of the old Red Lion, which &s;hould ob|tain the be&s;t cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The love,"</Q> &s;aid he <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>France</HI> bears to this coun|try has been depicted in all the glowing rant of romance.

<P>The two hou&s;es met on the 27th of November, 1787. It was &s;tated in the &s;peech that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had taken mea&s;ures to enforce his demand of &s;atisfaction for the in&s;ult offered to the Prince&s;s of Orange.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke took occa&s;ion to mention the King's &s;peech, which he &s;poke of with great humour and plea&s;antry; he &s;aid, it was u&s;ual to hold it out as a mor&s;el of fini&s;hed eloquence, and as a proof of the mini&s;ter's powers of compo&s;ition. The &s;peech was certainly an extraordinary performance, but if any man was to make it, and the facts it contained the grounds of hi&s;torical narrative, he would certainly ri&s;que a good deal of ridicule. In&s;tead of grave hi&s;tory, it partook more of the nature of an epic poem, rather re&s;embling an agreeable allegory, or a romance in the &s;tyle of ancient chivalry. It re|minded him pretty &s;trongly of Palmeron of England, Don Bellianis of Greece, and other books of that romantic nature, which he formerly had lo&s;t much of his time in reading. He was glad to find, however, that the gallantry of tho&s;e kings and princes, that had &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves when chi|valry prevailed, was revived. Let any gentleman examine the vein in which the &s;peech proceeded, and he would in&s;tantly perceive the &s;trong re&s;emblance it bore to the &s;ubjects of ancient romance. A chi|valrous king hearing that a prince&s;s had been affront|ed,
<PB N="cix" REF="113">
takes his lance, a&s;&s;embles his knights, and deter|mines to do her ju&s;tice. He &s;ets out in&s;tantly with his knights in que&s;t of adventures, and carries all before him, atchieving wonders in the cau&s;e of the injured prince&s;s. This reminded him of the ancient &s;tory of a prince&s;s named Latona, who, having been in&s;ulted by a nation, like the Dutch, appealed to Jupiter for &s;atisfaction, when the God, in revenge for her wrongs, turned the nation that had affronted her into a nation of frogs, and left them to live among dykes and wa|ters. [<HI>The Hou&s;e bur&s;t into a roar of laughter at the apt introduction of this old fable.</HI>] Mr. Burke pur&s;ued his plea&s;antry with laughable comments on the &s;peech, and among others he remarked, that although the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had profe&s;&s;edly &s;et out merely to obtain adequate &s;atisfaction for the injury done his &s;i&s;ter; his army, by accident, took Utrecht, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Am&s;terdam, re&s;tored the Stadtholder and the former government, and all this at a &s;troke, and, <HI>by the bye,</HI> which put him in mind of a ver&s;e in a &s;prightly &s;ong of Cowley's (his ballad, entitled the Chronicle) that he often had read with plea&s;ure,
<Q><L>But when I&s;abella came</L>
<L>Arm'd with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s flame</L>
<L>And th' artillery of her eye,</L>
<L>While &s;he proudly marched about,</L>
<L>Greater conque&s;ts to find out,</L>
<L>She beat out Su&s;an, <HI>by the bye.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Though Mr. Burke affected to de&s;pi&s;e popularity, yet no man, perhaps, was ever more &s;u&s;ceptible of flattery, which he always paid in kind, but a &s;troke of wit, or a &s;ingle paragraph in a new&s;paper, were &s;ufficient to di&s;compo&s;e his temper, particularly when he was &s;inking into the vale of life. A few years &s;ince, he happened to call on an old friend, who was very fond of collecting prints of Briti&s;h patriots. Mr. Burke was not a little plea&s;ed to &s;ee one of him&s;elf in that li&s;t, with the following rude, but pointed lines written under it with a pencil, which he did not imme|diately perceive;
<Q><PB N="cx" REF="114">
<L>Pelliculam veterem retinet, ac fronte polite</L>
<L>Astutam vapido &s;ervat &s;ub pectore vulpem.</L></Q></P>
<P>The old gentleman &s;aw, by Mr. Burke's counte|nance, that it di&s;plea&s;ed him, but prote&s;ted he was wholly ignorant of the writer, and that, as he did not under&s;tand Latin, he thought the lines were filled with his prai&s;e, and immediately effaced them, but they had &s;unk too deep in Mr. Burke's memory to be effaced; he took a ha&s;ty leave, and never after entered the hou&s;e. In the parliamentary rece&s;s of 1788, he went to Ireland, accompanied by his &s;on. His arrival in that country was announced in a provincial new&s;paper in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"Af|ter an ab&s;ence of many years, the celebrated Iri&s;h orator and Briti&s;h member of parliament, Edmund Burke, has arrived in his native country. It is not flattery to &s;ay, that he is the boa&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;enate, and the glory of the Iri&s;h nation."</Q> One of the fir&s;t poets in that kingdom wrote &s;ome encomi|a&s;tic ver&s;es on the occa&s;ion, which Mr. Burke repaid in pro&s;e, equal in point of fancy and imagination to the tuneful effu&s;ion. It was deemed a little ex|traordinary that the univer&s;ity of Dublin did not then pre&s;ent him with the honorary degree of doctor of laws, but he was never heard to acknowledge that he was highly indebted to the education which he received in that &s;eminary. Having &s;pent &s;ome months in the &s;outh of Ireland, he returned to England. The Reverend Doctor Campbell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of the Hi&s;tory of Ireland.</NOTE> hap|pened to &s;ail in the packet with him; <Q REND="inline">"I don't know any thing,"</Q> &s;aid the Doctor to a friend one day, <Q REND="inline">"that gave me &s;o much plea&s;ure as to find that I was to cro&s;s the Iri&s;h Helle&s;pont in the company of a man of whom I had heard &s;o much.

<PB N="cxi" REF="115">
introduce me to him, but it was not difficult to pro|voke Mr. Burke to conver&s;ation. We were in &s;ight of the hill of Howth ju&s;t as the &s;un began to &s;pread his beams. Mr. Burke enjoyed the beauties of the &s;cenery, even the light clouds, which enveloped the top of the hill, did not e&s;cape his attention; <Q REND="inline">"I won|der, &s;aid he, that &s;ome of the Dublin milliners do not form a head-dre&s;s in imitation of tho&s;e many coloured clouds, and call it the Howth-cap."</Q> His conver&s;ation was rich and captivating; he told me he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days at Lord Kenmere's country &s;eat, near the lakes of Killarney&mdash;that delightful &s;pot, which ta&s;te &s;eems to have &s;elected from all that is beautiful in the volume of nature. But his de&s;cription of it exceeded any thing I had ever read or heard before, particularly when he touched on the flowery race; good heaven! how he cloathed the lilly in new-born light, and the ro&s;e in virgin blu&s;hes; in &s;hort, it may be &s;aid, that he almo&s;t coloured round. Speaking of Lord Charlemont, he prai&s;ed the gentlene&s;s of his manners, and the mildne&s;s of his temper, and con|cluded by comparing him to an old picture, who&s;e tints were mellowed by time. When I talked of the &s;tate of learning in Ireland, he &s;hook his head, folded his arms, and remained &s;ilent for a few mi|nutes. In his per&s;on he is about five feet eight inches, remarkably &s;traight for his years, but his mind is more erect than his body. There is a good deal of placidity in his countenance, but nothing of dignity, and, from his no&s;e, I think that no man can &s;neer with more ea&s;e and effect if he chu&s;es."</Q></P>

that of the Baian Homer. Having paid many ju&s;t compliments to the ta&s;te of the collector, he entered into conver&s;ation with me in &s;o ea&s;y and friendly a manner, that if I was charmed a few minutes before with the ta&s;te and judicious reflection of the &s;cholar, I was not le&s;s delighted with the man. I &s;hewed him an old manu&s;cript copy of Homer (written, I believe, in the tenth century) he read a few pa&s;&s;ages in it with the greate&s;t fluency, and critici&s;ed &s;ome of the critics who had written on the father of im|mortal ver&s;e.

<P>Dr. King. <Q REND="inline">Can you &s;peak Iri&s;h?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B. <Q REND="inline">I could &s;peak a little of it when I was a boy, and I can remember a few words and phra&s;es &s;till. Poetry was highly cultivated by the ancient Iri&s;h; &s;ome of their kings were &s;o &s;mitten with the love of &s;ong as to exchange the &s;ceptre for the harp.</Q></P>
<P>T. <Q REND="inline">The bards were very much protected and en|couraged, but having indulged too much in &s;atire and ribaldry, they were rather dreaded than e&s;teemed, and, at one time, the whole body was on the eve of being bani&s;hed, if St. Columkill had not interfered.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B. <Q REND="inline">Sedulius was an excellent poet.</Q></P>
<P>T. <Q REND="inline">Yes, his Latin poetry is very much admired.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B. <Q REND="inline">I read one of his hymns, that glowed with all the poet, the &s;pirit of it might be &s;aid to a&s;cend like the &s;pirit of a Chri&s;tian martyr, in the mid&s;t of flames, but I never could light on his works.</Q></P>

<P>Mr. B. <Q REND="inline">Wherever they are &s;cattered they will &s;hine like &s;tars. There was a poet that u&s;ed to compo&s;e a little in his native language when I was a boy, I forget his name.</Q></P>

<P>T. <Q REND="inline">Great expectations were formed from Doctor Leland; he had lei&s;ure, talents, and almo&s;t every op|portunity.

<P>Mr. B. <Q REND="inline">Your plea&s;ant hi&s;torians &s;hould be read with caution. Leland promi&s;ed a voluminous hi&s;|tory, and &s;o far he has kept his promi&s;e, but he has not done ju&s;tice to all.</Q></P>

<P>The conver&s;ation turned on poetry, which Mr. Burke called <Q REND="inline">"the art of &s;ub&s;tantiating &s;hadows, and to lend exi&s;tence to nothing."</Q> He prai&s;ed Milton for the judicious choice of his epithets; this led him to &s;ay a few words on the u&s;e and abu&s;e of tho&s;e flowery adjectives, as Pontanus calls them, and lamented that &s;ome per&s;on of ta&s;te did not collect a garland of them out of the Engli&s;h poets, as Tex|tor had out of the Latin, which laid every cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar under great obligation to him, as he had plucked the faire&s;t flowers that &s;ipped ca&s;talion dew.</P>
<P>Geography, he &s;aid, was an earthly &s;ubject, but a heavenly &s;tudy. One of the company happened to mention &s;ome gentlemen who intended to promote di&s;coveries in the interior parts of Africa, Mr. Burke &s;aid, the intention was truly laudable; <Q REND="inline">"Africa,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"was worth exploring, it &s;eemed as if nature, in &s;ome great convul&s;ion or revolution of her empire, had fled to that quarter with all her trea&s;ures, &s;ome of which &s;he had concealed in the bowels of the earth, but the &s;urface exhibited &s;uch abundance and variety of the vegetable and animal race, that a few miles would enrich the conque&s;ts of natural hi&s;tory. Witne&s;s on the very &s;hores of that continent&mdash;the cabbage-tree, that towered into all the &s;ublimity of the pine, and the luxuriance of the &s;preading oak, and yet &s;o tender that a few &s;trokes of a fabre were &s;ufficient to lay it pro&s;trate on the earth. Africa was rightly called the mother of mon&s;ters, for there was not a &s;ufficient number of minor animals el&s;e|where to feed the huge bea&s;ts that ranged the fore&s;ts in that country.

<P><Q REND="inline">"But the thir&s;t of European avarice and cruelty had rai&s;ed a barrier round the coa&s;ts of that quarter, which prevented all communication with the inoffen|&s;ive inhabitants.

<P>In 1788, &s;everal petitions were pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Commons, praying the abolition of the &s;lave trade, and on the 9th of May, in the &s;ame year, Mr. Pitt moved and carried a re&s;olution founded on their petitions, the purport of which was, to de|clare that the Hou&s;e would proceed to the inve&s;tiga|tion of that infamous traffic early in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke entered into this &s;ubject with the &s;pirit of a man who felt for all mankind. His eloquence was never poured forth in a better cau&s;e&mdash;it was the cau&s;e of humanity. As he knew that he had intere&s;t and prejudice to contend with, he took the que&s;tion even on the&s;e grounds; he clearly evinced the im|policy of it, rai&s;ed the African from that low &s;cale of creation into which he had been thrown, up to the dignity of man, vindicated the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and providence of God, in the formation, &s;ituation, and order of all his beings. His de&s;cription of a
<PB N="cxviii" REF="122">
&s;lave &s;hip, and the unhappy wretches that were piled together in its womb, drew tears from many that heard him. He then ran out into an eulogy on humanity, in order to &s;hew that man, dive&s;ted of feeling, may be cla&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t mon&s;ter.&mdash;The part which he took during his Maje&s;ty's indi&s;|po&s;ition in 1788, is &s;ufficiently known. Mr. Burke's be&s;t friends mu&s;t lament that he did not ab&s;tain from &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions on that melancholy occa&s;ion, which have &s;ubtracted from the &s;incerity of &s;ub&s;equent pro|fe&s;&s;ions. His &s;overeign, however, treated him in a very different manner when he was afflicted by the hand of Providence. During the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s in parliament, Mr. Pitt addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the Prince of Wales, dated 30th December, which &s;tated, <Q REND="inline">"that it was the opinion of his Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ervants, that His Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould be empowered to exerci&s;e the royal authority during the illne&s;s, and in the name of his father; provided ne|verthele&s;s, that the care of the King's per&s;on, with the di&s;po&s;ition of his hou&s;ehold, &s;hould be committed to the Queen; and that the power to be exerci&s;ed by the Prince, &s;hould not extend to the per&s;onal pro|perty of his father; to the granting of any office, rever&s;ion or pen&s;ion, except where the law ab&s;olutely required it, as in the ca&s;e of the judges, for any other term than during the King's plea&s;ure; nor to the con|ferring of any peerage, unle&s;s upon &s;uch per&s;ons of the royal i&s;&s;ue as &s;hould have attained the age of twenty one years."</Q> The Prince of Wales's an&s;wer was written by Mr. Burke, is dated Jan. 29, 1789. It is worthy of being pre&s;ented as a pure model of the epi&s;tolary &s;tile, and expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;entiments of the Prince on a &s;ubject of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t natural concern, and per&s;onal delicacy. After acknowledg|ing the receipt of Mr. Pitt's letter, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"done by the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, could be a proper &s;ubject of his animadver&s;ion; but when, previou&s;ly to any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in parliament, the out|line
<PB N="cxix" REF="123">
of a &s;cheme of government, in which it was propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be per&s;onally and principally concerned, and by which the royal authority and the public welfare might be deeply affected, were &s;ent to him for his con&s;ideration, it would be unju&s;tifiable in him to withhold an explicit declaration of his &s;en|timents. His &s;ilence might be con&s;trued into a previous approbation of a plan, the accompli&s;hment of which every motive of duty to his father and &s;overeign, as well as of regard for the public intere&s;t, obliged him to con&s;ider as injurious to both. He did not expect that a plan, by which government was to be rendered difficult, if not impracticable, would be offered to his con&s;ideration, at a moment when government, deprived of its chief energy and &s;upport, &s;eemed peculiarly to need the cordial and united aid of all de&s;criptions of good &s;ubjects. He forbore to remark on the &s;everal parts of the &s;ketch laid before him. It was not probable that any argu|ment of his would produce an alteration of &s;entiment in the projectors of it. But he tru&s;ted to the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of parliament, when the &s;ubject &s;hould come under their deliberation. It was with deep regret that he perceived in the contents of Mr. Pitt's paper a project for introducing weakne&s;s, di&s;order, in&s;ecurity into every branch of political bu&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;a project for dividing the royal family from each other; for &s;eparating the court from the &s;tate; and depriving government of its natural and accu&s;tomed &s;upport;&mdash;a &s;cheme for di&s;connecting the authority to command &s;ervice, from the power of animating it by reward; and for allotting to the prince all the invidious duties of government, without the means of &s;oftening them to the public by any one act of grace, favour, or benignity. His feelings were ren|dered more painful by ob&s;erving, that the plan was not founded in any general principle, but was cal|culated to infu&s;e jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions in that quarter, who&s;e confidence it would ever be the fir&s;t
<PB N="cxx" REF="124">
pride of his life to merit and obtain. On the mo|tives and object of the re&s;triction he had little to ob&s;erve. Mini&s;ters had only informed him what the powers were which they meant to refu&s;e, not why they were withheld. As the powers and preroga|tives of the crown were ve&s;ted there in tru&s;t for the benefit of the people, and were &s;ecured only becau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the point and balance of the con&s;titution, the plea of public utility ought to be &s;trong, manife&s;t, and urgent, which called for the extinction or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of any one of tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential rights in the &s;upreme power or its repre&s;entatives, or which could ju&s;tify the prince in con&s;enting, that in his per&s;on an experiment &s;hould be made, to a&s;certain with how &s;mall a portion of the kingly power the executive government of the country might be carried on. If &s;ecurity for the king's re|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his rightful government were any part of the object of the propo&s;ed plan, the prince had only to be convinced that any mea&s;ure was nece&s;&s;ary, or even conducive to that end, to be the fir&s;t to urge it, as the preliminary and paramount con&s;ideration of any &s;ettlement, in which he would con&s;ent to &s;hare. If attention to what it was pre&s;umed might be the king's feelings and wi&s;hes on the happy day of his recovery were the object, it was with the true&s;t &s;in|cerity the prince expre&s;&s;ed his firm conviction, that no event could be more repugnant to the feelings of his royal father, than to know, that the government of his &s;on and repre&s;entative had exhibited the &s;ove|reign power in a &s;tate of degradation, of curtailed authority, and dimini&s;hed energy&mdash;a &s;tate, hurtful in practice to the pro&s;perity and good government of his people, and injurious in its precedent to the &s;ecu|rity of the monarch, and the rights of his family. The prince al&s;o felt him&s;elf compelled to remark, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary for Mr. Pitt, nor proper, to &s;ugge&s;t a re&s;traint on his granting away the king's real and per&s;onal property: he did not conceive that
<PB N="cxxi" REF="125">
he was by law entiled to make any &s;uch grant; and he was &s;ure, that he never had &s;hewn the &s;malle&s;t inclination to po&s;&s;e&s;s any &s;uch power. He had di&s;|charged his duty in thus giving his free opinion of the plan. Yet, his conviction of the evils which might ari&s;e from the government of the country, remained longer in a maimed and debilitated &s;tate, outweighed in his mind every other con&s;ideration, and would determine him to undertake the painful tru&s;t impo&s;ed upon him by the pre&s;ent melancholy nece&s;&s;ity (which of all the king's &s;ubjects he deplored the mo&s;t) in full confidence, that the affection and loyalty to the king, the experienced attachment to the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, and the genero&s;ity which had always di&s;tingui&s;hed the nation, would carry him through the many difficulties, in&s;eparable from &s;o critical a &s;ituation, with comfort to him&s;elf, with honour to the king, and with advantage to the pub|lic."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke is al&s;o &s;aid to have been the author of a &s;peech intended to have been delivered by the Duke of York in the upper Hou&s;e on certain pro|vi&s;ions in the regency bill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is now in print.</NOTE>. It abounds with elo|quence and argument, and does not appear to have dimini&s;hed the writer's &s;tock either of the one or the other, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every &s;tage of the bill. Mr. Burke &s;ometimes ruffled even the <HI>placid</HI> temper of Mr. Pitt in the&s;e debates. The latter called the former to order &s;everal times. Mr. Burke was not very fond of being interrupted in his flights, e&s;pecially when he mounted his fiery footed cour&s;er, and dealt out his arrows in almo&s;t every direction, which happened to be one night the ca&s;e; the fir&s;t time he was arre&s;ted in his career in a tone little le&s;s impa&s;&s;ionate than his own, which did not e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation. <Q REND="inline">"The Right Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Pitt) &s;aid he, calls me to order in &s;o mild a

voice, that it reminds me of two lines which I once read in an old poet:&mdash;</Q>
<Q><L>There roar'd the prophet of the northern nation,</L>
<L>Scorch'd in a flaming &s;peech on moderation.</L></Q>
He had not proceeded very far when he was called to order again by Mr. Pitt, with a &s;mile, which Mr. Burke &s;aid, reminded him of a line in another poet:
<Q><L>There madne&s;s laugh'd in ireful mood.</L></Q></P>
<P>The a&s;perities which pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the&s;e two gen|tlemen throughout the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bill, le&s;t little room to expect for that coalition which after|wards took place.</P>
<P>On the 7th of March, 1788, Mr. Steele brought up the report of Mr. Pitt's Ea&s;t India Declaratory Bill. Mr. Burke declared, on the introduction of this bill that he would re&s;i&s;t it in every &s;tage; he kept his word, and having exhau&s;ted all his arguments, he flew to tho&s;e that were inexhau&s;tible in his hands&mdash;&s;atyr and plea|&s;antry. He was particularly &s;evere on Mr. Dundas. He compared the bill it&s;elf to a <HI>Polypus</HI> of pream|bles; it came forward, he &s;aid, like other in&s;ects, in the humble form of an egg, then a caterpillar, then a fly, &amp;c. He then changed the &s;imile, and &s;aid, when it was fir&s;t brought in it was &s;hewn about like an abortion in a bottle. Such was the &s;everity of &s;ome of his remarks, that even Mr. Dundas evidently evinced that he felt &s;ore.</P>
<P>On the 2d of March, 1790, Mr. Fox moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the Corporation and Te&s;t Acts. Mr. Burke oppo&s;ed the motion in a &s;peech of con&s;iderable length, in the cour&s;e of which he read &s;everal extracts from the political writings of Dr. Prie&s;tley, and commented on them with great acerbity and per&s;onal rancour.</P>
<P>Mr. Grey, actuated by the pure&s;t motives of hu|manity, brought in a bill for the relief of unfortunate debtors. Mr. Burke paid many hand&s;ome compli|ments
<PB N="cxxiii" REF="127">
to the Honourable Mover, and the pains which he had taken to di&s;tingui&s;h the unfortunate from the criminal. His (Mr. B's) de&s;cription of the fir&s;t cla&s;s was extremely pathetic and affecting. The facility of credit in this country, he ob&s;erved, gave the creditor a ra&s;h re&s;ort to the per&s;on of debtor. The mind of the latter might be &s;aid to be impri&s;oned even before his per&s;on was immured in the walls of a gaol. The &s;ight of a &s;trange face filled him with alarm, the ap|pearance of a letter &s;hook his nerves, and a knock at the door filled his brea&s;t with anxiety, &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and fear: and after he had pined for &s;ome years in mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, if enlarged by an act of grace or in&s;olvency, he returned from the bare walls of a pri&s;on to the bare walls of a gloomy apartment and a fami&s;hed family, with his credit bla&s;ted, and every ray of hope tinged with de&s;pair.</P>
<P>On the 27th of February, 1790, Mr. Flood gave notice that he intended, on the 4th of the next month, to move for leave to bring in a bill to re|form the repre&s;entation in parliament. Mr. Burke reque&s;ted his Honourable Friend (Mr. F.) would recal the notice he had ju&s;t given, and ab&s;tain from all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the &s;ubject; the fire of liberty, as it was fal&s;ely called, had been kindled in a neigh|bouring country, and he did not wi&s;h that one of the &s;parks of that flame &s;hould fall in this, for it was not that mild temperate flame that might be called the emanation of rea&s;on, religion, and prudence; but a devouring fire, at which the ferocious demagogue lighted his brand. This was the fir&s;t time that he mentioned the revolution of France in the Hou&s;e of Commons. As he had touched on this &s;ubject, he &s;carce ever mi&s;&s;ed to introduce it in the mo&s;t trivial debate. As Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Fox did not ac|company him to the full extent of all tho&s;e Philippics, it was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, from his countenance and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which he dropt, that he meditated an attack on tho&s;e two gentlemen, which he carried
<PB N="cxxiv" REF="128">
partly into execution on the report of the army e&s;timates on the 5th of February, 1790. The manly openne&s;s and candour of Mr. Fox, and the mildne&s;s of his reply to what had fallen from Mr. Burke on that occa&s;ion, &s;eemed to have &s;ome effect in &s;oothing his temper for the time, &s;o that he did not pour out all the vials of his wrath; but on the 9th of the &s;ame month he came down to the Hou&s;e, fully prepared to renew the attack; he began with a detail of the French revo|lution from what he called the <HI>blood-bud</HI> of it to the time he was &s;peaking; he then entered into a hi&s;tory of the authors of it. Such a biographical &s;ketch was never exhibited; &s;carce could the imagination of a Shake&s;peare call &s;uch a bloody, tyrannical, pro|&s;cribing, ferocious, crew into exi&s;tence; &s;uch a catalogue of crimes, &s;uch a li&s;t of vices, were never ca&s;t in the mint of human depravity: <Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e wretches,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"had lo&s;t all preten&s;ion to the name of man; they, like Herod and Nero, looked on humanity to be weakne&s;s, virtue a preju|dice; their hearts could be only warmed with the &s;acrilegious flames that devoured prie&s;ts and altars; they naturalized murder, croaked and thir&s;ted for blood and power, attempted to invert the very de|crees of nature, and called on <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> as the <HI>order</HI> of the day.</Q></P>
<P>Throughout the whole of this &s;peech Mr. Burke did not &s;o much as touch on <HI>lettres de cachet,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> or the farmers general, who drank the tears of the widows and orphans out of cups of gold.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox complimented Mr. Burke on his elo|quence, but repeated his former declaration, that if ever he could look at a &s;tanding army with le&s;s con|&s;titutional jealou&s;y than before, it was now, &s;ince, during the late tran&s;actions in France, the army had manife&s;ted, that on becoming <HI>&s;oldiers</HI> they did not cea&s;e to continue <HI>citizens,</HI> and would not act as the mere in&s;truments of a de&s;pot. This expre&s;&s;ion re|newed Mr. Burke's choler, and as his brain was well
<PB N="cxxv" REF="129">
known to be a mint of phra&s;es, he attacked the French revolution with redoubled rage, nor was he choice of the epithets which he applied to Mr. Fox. They pa&s;&s;ed by him, it is true, like <Q REND="inline">"the idle wind which he re&s;pected not,"</Q> but his heart was &s;o full to think of the conduct of a man who held &s;o dear a place in it, that he bur&s;t into tears. Mr. Sheridan ro&s;e, and commented on Mr. Burke's &s;peech with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible force of argument, eloquence, and poignancy of wit, that Mr. Burke immediately threw off the ma&s;k, bur&s;t into an open declaration of ho&s;|tilities, and declared that his Honourable Friend and he were from that moment <HI>&s;eparated in their politics for ever.</HI> His ge&s;ture and countenance on pro|nouncing the&s;e words, were compared by a gen|tleman in the gallery to the &s;oldier mentioned in Lucan's Phar&s;alia, who was bit by a &s;erpent in the de&s;ert of Lybia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Tendit cutem, pereunte figut&acirc;,</L>

<L>Efflatur &s;anies: late pollente veneno,</L>
<L>Ip&s;e latet penit&ugrave;s conge&s;to corpore mer&s;us.</L></Q></NOTE>. Mr. Burke's conduct on this occa&s;ion gave birth to various conjectures. It was &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome that he envied the talents of Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan, but truth is the daughter of time, and &s;he has &s;ince brought the whole to light.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke was among&s;t the fir&s;t to prai&s;e the revo|lution in Poland, but he was &s;carce ever heard to lament the fate of it. When he &s;aw the foundation of that glorious edifice laid, he rejoiced at it, but when he &s;aw it buried in ruins, he never was known to &s;hed a tear over it. In commemoration of that promi&s;ing event, in which, to u&s;e his own words, <Q REND="inline">"every thing was kept in its place and order, but in that place and order every thing was bettered,"</Q> the Poles &s;truck a medal of the late unfortuate

Poniatou&s;ki, his maje&s;ty &s;ent one of tho&s;e warm from the mint to Mr. Burke, with a letter in his own hand writing in the Engli&s;h language, as he &s;aid, he thought it the mo&s;t copious and energetic to convey the high &s;en&s;e which he entertained of Mr. Burke's patrioti&s;m and talents. Mr. Burke returned a very polite an|&s;wer, &s;tating that &s;o high a mark of e&s;teem might be &s;uppo&s;ed to awaken his vanity, but it tended rather to encrea&s;e his veneration and e&s;teem for the cha|racter of a prince whom he had long admired. He &s;aid, he had no cabinet of medals, but that if he had the riche&s;t in the univer&s;e he was per&s;uaded he would be at a lo&s;s in what illu&s;trious &s;eries he would place that of his maje&s;ty. It mu&s;t be placed as the fir&s;t of a new one; he had a &s;on, and happy would it be for him if he lived to be able to add a &s;econd to it. He then launched out in prai&s;e of the Poli&s;h revolution, the origin and progre&s;s of which he a&s;cribed to the king; <Q REND="inline">"You,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that may be truly called the father and not the proprietor of your people."</Q> He entreated his maje&s;ty to pardon the length of the letter, as the language of command was brevity, but he was grown old, and fond of dwelling on a theme &s;o dear to his heart, be&s;ides it was the very nature of gratitude, that it thought it never could &s;ay enough.</P>
<P>On the 30th of April, 1792, Mr. Grey brought forward the que&s;tion of parliamentary reform. Mr. Burke ro&s;e immediately after Mr. Fox had delivered his opinion on this momentous que&s;tion. He claimed the indulgence of the Hou&s;e as one that did not trouble them often, and one who was not to be impelled by a &s;mall exigency. <Q REND="inline">"He knew him&s;elf unfit for the general duties of the Hou&s;e, and was not like the archbi&s;hop of Grenada, who, contrary to the motives and remon&s;trances of his be&s;t friends, would not be per&s;uaded that his facul|ties were on the decline, when found no longer fit for the &s;ituation he held, he could, without great
<PB N="cxxvii" REF="131">
concern, obey the voice that warned him to <HI>retire;</HI> yet, after &s;erving in that Hou&s;e for twenty-&s;even years, he might &s;till be of &s;ome u&s;e in defending it's borders, as invalids, after wearing out their youth, and compacted manhood, are placed in garri&s;on, when di&s;charged from the active duties of military life."</Q> He in&s;i&s;ted that a remedy &s;hould not be re|&s;orted to till the di&s;ea&s;e was pointed out, and that the grievances pointed out and exaggerated, did not exi&s;t, and that the attempt was merely to en&s;nare people by the gingle of the word <HI>reform,</HI> a word of five letters, and worth little more than the &s;ounds they conveyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;till affected a kind of whining friend|&s;hip for Mr. Fox; he did not ri&s;e &s;o often as u&s;ual, and when he did, it was merely to introduce the French revolution. Almo&s;t every &s;peech which he delivered on this &s;ubject, might be divided into three parts, the tragic, the comic, and the farcical. In the la&s;t he often &s;unk to mere buffoonery, but the whole was eloquent in general. It was in the fir&s;t of the&s;e divi&s;ions that he introduced the dagger &s;cene; this was a practical trope, as Mr. Sheridan called it, and as he had declared a few minutes before, he drew that weapon from his bo&s;om that neutrality was his motto. Mr. Courtenay humour|ou&s;ly called it an armed neutrality as &s;oon as he &s;aw it in his hand. In one of his <HI>antigallican</HI> &s;peeches he drew a humourous picture of the metaphy&s;icians, rhetoricians, and politicians of France, in the cour&s;e of which he illu&s;trated the <HI>new lights</HI> of that coun|try with the following quotation:&mdash;
<Q><L>So have I &s;een in larder dark,</L>
<L>Of veal a lucid loin,</L>
<L>Replete with many a brilliant &s;park,</L>
<L>(As wi&s;e philo&s;ophers remark)</L>
<L>At once both <HI>&s;tink</HI> and <HI>&s;hine.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="cxxviii" REF="132">On the 18th of February, 1793, Mr. Fox brought forward a motion relative to the war. As Mr. Burke was at war with the French, at war with Mr. Fox; &amp;c. &amp;c. and at war with him&s;elf, this motion fur|ni&s;hed him with an opportunity of pouring out all that he had bottled up on the &s;ubject. Towards the conclu&s;ion of his &s;peech, he entered into a character of all the individuals in France, with whom a mi|ni&s;ter from this country might be &s;uppo&s;ed to treat. From Roland down to Santerre he prote&s;ted that the hangman was the only hone&s;t man in France; and that every man, woman, and child in that coun|try were murderers. He was extremely angry with Mr. Fox for calling the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia a de&s;pot with re&s;pect to the part which he took in the plunder of Poland. He &s;aid, he could buy a parrot for a &s;hilling that could be taught to &s;ay de&s;pot, de&s;pot, from morn till night. Mr. Grey an&s;wered, that a parrot could be al&s;o taught to &s;ay murderer, ban|ditti, Bri&s;&s;ot, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the 4th of March, 1793, Mr. Sheridan moved for a committee to enquire into the &s;editious practices alleged to exi&s;t in the country. Mr. Burke continued to &s;it in the oppo&s;i|tion bench, but as &s;oon as Mr. Sheridan had handed his motion to the Speaker, Mr. Burke &s;tarted up, ran towards the Trea&s;ury Bench, and when he got to the middle of the floor, he turned round, looked with an eye full of indignation on tho&s;e he had left behind him, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I quit the camp, I quit the camp.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He hoped, as the Honourable Gentleman <HI>had quitted the camp as a de&s;erter, that he would not return as a &s;py.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In 1792, Mr. Burke addre&s;&s;ed a letter to his friend, Sir H. Langri&s;he, <Q REND="inline">"on the Roman Ca|tholics of Ireland, and the propriety of admitting them to the elective franchi&s;e con&s;i&s;tently with the principles of the con&s;titution, as e&s;tabli&s;hed at the revolution."</Q> As this que&s;tion had occupied his attention from his earlie&s;t days, &s;o it exhibits all
<PB N="cxxix" REF="133">
the marks of the different &s;tages of his life&mdash;the toys of childhood, the fire of youth, the vigour of man|hood, and the cool collected judgment of old age. He has endeavoured to prove in this pamphlet, that the a&s;cendancy of humanity, ju&s;tice, and &s;ound policy ought to ri&s;e &s;uperior to the a&s;cendancy of any religi|ous &s;ect or party&mdash;<HI>Religionis non e&s;t cogere religionem.</HI></P>
<P>On the 28th of February, 1793, Mr. Burke and his &s;on withdrew their names from the Whig Club.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke's writings on the French revolution have been &s;o univer&s;ally read, that it is needle&s;s to make any remarks on them, and though they abound with many &s;plendid pa&s;&s;ages, there is &s;carce an ori|ginal thought in the whole. The fir&s;t pamphlet which he publi&s;hed on that &s;ubject is chiefly taken from the writings of Mallet du Pan. Having now retired on a pen&s;ion, it was thought that he would have laid down the pen, and enjoyed him&s;elf in the conver&s;ation of a few &s;elect friends, or in read|ing &s;uch writers as teach us to wean our affections from all &s;ublunary matters, e&s;pecially as he had lo&s;t his &s;on, the prop of his old age. In this &s;ituation, it was expected that he would have exclaimed with the poet on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion:
<Q><L>Know all the di&s;tant din the world can keep,</L>
<L>Rolls o'er my grotto, and but &s;ooths my &s;leep.</L></Q></P>
<P>But his pa&s;&s;ions accompanied him whither&s;oever he went, and in that very retirement he attacked the Duke of Bedford, becau&s;e that young nobleman di&s;|charged his public duty. The privileged cla&s;s, how|ever, we believe will not con&s;ider that attack as a trophy that ought to be hung on the Corinthian pillar of poli&s;hed &s;ociety. His conduct to Mr. Fox was rather my&s;terious, but his pen&s;ion explained it. He might have parted with his old friend in a more decent and dignified manner. He was envious of his great talents undoubtedly, and though artful enough in every other re&s;pect, he could not conceal
<PB N="cxxx" REF="134">
it, for he complained in the Hou&s;e of Commons that Mr. Fox's &s;peeches were detailed at greater length and with more fidelity than his own. It was &s;till more vi&s;ible one day with a man of letters, who made the following remark:&mdash;<HI>In Tullio omnes linguam mirantur, pectus non aequ&egrave;: In Ari&s;totele pectus omnes, linguam non item: In Foxio, pectus et linguam aequ&egrave;.</HI> His irritability might be &s;aid to have grown with his growth, and to have gathered &s;trength with his weakne&s;s, and there was &s;carce a &s;haft leveled at him in the public prints or other medium that he did not read. Some years &s;ince at dinner at Lord Tankerville's, the conver&s;ation turned on caricatures; a gentleman ob&s;erved, that he be|lieved Mr. Fox had been oftener exhibited in that line than any other man in the kingdom. <Q REND="inline">"I beg your pardon,'</Q> &s;aid Mr. Burke, <Q REND="inline">"I think I may put in my claim to a greater number and variety of ex|hibitions in that way than my honourable friend."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Mr. Fox, <Q REND="inline">"they give you no un|ea&s;ine&s;s."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Not in the lea&s;t,"</Q> replied Mr. Burke, <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een them all, and I remember them all, and if it would not be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the indulgence of the company, I could repeat the different cha|racters in which I have been repre&s;ented, obedient to the mimic powers of the pencil."</Q> Accordingly he began and de&s;cribed them all in &s;o humourous a manner as to &s;et the table on a roar.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke had only one child, a &s;on; he was educated at Oxford, and returned for the borough of Malton, but never took his &s;eat. As his health was vi&s;ibly on the decline, his father took lodgings for him at Brompton for the benefit of the air. He was attended by Doctor Brockl&s;by. His father was incon&s;olable, and in the agony of his grief wrung his hands one morning, and &s;ighed &s;o deeply that his &s;on overheard him, which induced him to ri&s;e, dre&s;s, and walk down &s;tairs, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;er|vant. When he came to the door he pau&s;ed to col|lect
<PB N="cxxxi" REF="135">
&s;trength, walked in without any help, and &s;eated him&s;elf on the &s;opha between his father and mother; the day was fine; he ro&s;e and repeated Milton's morning hymn, &s;at down, ro&s;e a &s;econd time to repeat it again, but had &s;carce uttered a few lines when he &s;unk into the arms of his parents, and ex|pired without a &s;igh, in the thirty-&s;eventh year of his age.</P>
<P>Soon after Mr. Burke publi&s;hed his <HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France,</HI> it was intended to pre&s;ent him with the freedom of the univer&s;ity of Dublin and other academic honours, but the warm part which he took in the que&s;tion of the emancipation of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, prevented that intention, it is &s;aid, from being carried into effect, and if it even had it could not encrea&s;e his fame as a writer or &s;peaker. He did not tru&s;t to his pen in promoting the cau&s;e of the Catholics, he &s;ent his &s;on to Ireland for that purpo&s;e, who received a thou&s;and pounds for his mi&s;&s;ion. This induced many to be|lieve that the zeal which was exhibited on that occa&s;ion flowed from his attachment to the Romi&s;h Church, and the old erroneous &s;tory of his being bred at St. Omers was revived. This que&s;tion being put one day to Dr. Doctor Gold&s;mith, <Q REND="inline">"I don't &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"that he had any occa&s;ion to be bred there."</Q> To repel tho&s;e charges, he wrote a letter to Thomas Burgh, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Old Town, in Ireland, in which he &s;tated, at full length, the rea|&s;ons which induced him to become the advocate of the Iri&s;h Catholics. When Mr. Burke was a young man it is &s;aid that he attempted to write a tragedy, but that having &s;hewn a few pa&s;&s;ages of it to a friend, he was per&s;uaded to turn his attention to &s;ome other literary line, in which he would &s;hine to more advantage. His E&s;&s;ay on the Sublime and Beautiful was the fir&s;t production of his pen that drew the attention of the learned. When the late Lord Che&s;terfield fir&s;t read it, he &s;aid the &s;ublime was
<PB N="cxxxii" REF="136">
beautiful, and the beautiful &s;ublime. As an orator Mr. Burke paid very little attention to the graces, as his utterance was in general vehement, his ge&s;ticula|tion partook of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion. His reading was various, and he had the happy art of making every thing he read his own, &s;o that his plagiari&s;m often e&s;caped in the peculiar flow and modification of his words. His memory was tenacious, his imagination &s;o fervid and head &s;trong, that it could &s;carce be re&s;trained by his judgment, but &s;welled <Q REND="inline">"due on, and &s;carce ever knew retiring ebb."</Q> The &s;olidity of his judgment was often lo&s;t in the brilliancy of his fancy, as the &s;olidity of the &s;un is often lo&s;t in the &s;plendour of his beams. In the heat and whirl|wind of his pa&s;&s;ions he fell at times into low ex|pre&s;&s;ions, as the rapid &s;howers in South America when they wa&s;h down gold mingle it with common &s;and. He was a great lover of agriculture, ab&s;te|mious in his diet, and plain in his dre&s;s. His favorite maxim was, that the pa&s;&s;ions ought to in&s;truct the rea&s;on; this, perhaps, may account for his conduct in the evening of his life. If he had paid more attention to his private affairs, his friends and ad|mirers, perhaps, would not have to lament that he died a pen&s;ioner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Grandeur of &s;oul"</Q> &s;ays a celebrated writer, <Q REND="inline">"that haughtily &s;truggles with poverty, and will neither yield to, nor make terms with misfortunes; which through every &s;ituation repo&s;es a noble con|fidence in it&s;elf, and has an immoveable view to future glory and honour, a&s;toni&s;hes the world with admiration and delight. We, as it were, lean for|ward with &s;urprize and trembling joy to behold the human &s;oul collecting its &s;trength, and a&s;&s;erting a right to &s;uperior fates."</Q> During his la&s;t illne&s;s, Mr. Burke was attended by Doctor Lynn, of Wind&s;or. A cancerous ab&s;ce&s;s had been long gathering in his &s;ide, which at la&s;t came to a &s;uppuration. He was perfectly collected and &s;ound in his intellects to the
<PB N="cxxxiii" REF="137">
la&s;t moment, and a few hours before his death con|ver&s;ed with &s;ome of his friends on political &s;ubjects. His enmity to the French republic continued to burn 'till the fuel was quite exhau&s;ted. Having read one of Addi&s;on's papers in the Spectator, he felt him&s;elf &s;o weak that he beckoned to be removed, and expired as his dome&s;tics were conveying him to his bed.</P>

<HEAD>Character of Mr. Burke by an anonymous writer.</HEAD>
<P>As a &s;enator he was uniformly attached to the party he &s;et out with, and though his private fortune was far from being e&s;tabli&s;hed, and though different ad|mini&s;trations would be proud to detach him, he ro&s;e and fell with his party.</P>
<P>He has been charged with not being always con|&s;tant to his own declarations and definitions; but before he is judged on this ground, times and cir|cum&s;tances &s;hould be well weighed. In our mixed con&s;titution there are times when the power of the prince, or the people, may be alternately too much or too little, and the politician who now &s;peaks in favour of the one, and then of the other, may be equally con&s;i&s;tent. There was a period, not very remote from the pre&s;ent, when the power of the crown was thought <Q REND="inline">"to have encrea&s;ed, was en|crea&s;ing, and ought to be dimini&s;hed;"</Q> but now that democracy is taking &s;uch hideous &s;trides in Europe, every Engli&s;hman feels it his duty to rally round the throne, as the be&s;t &s;upport of freedom, &s;ubordination, and liberty.</P>
<P>He was a firm profe&s;&s;or of the Chri&s;tian religion, and exerci&s;ed its principles in its duties; wi&s;ely con|&s;idering, <Q REND="inline">"that whatever di&s;unites man from God, di&s;unites man from man."</Q> He looked within him|&s;elf for the regulation of his conduct, which was exemplary in all the relations of life; he was warm in

his affections, &s;imple in his manners, plain in his table, arrangements, &amp;c. &amp;c. and &s;o little affected with the follies and di&s;&s;ipations of what is called <Q REND="inline">"the higher cla&s;&s;es,"</Q> that he was totally ignorant of them; &s;o that this great man, with all his talents, would be mere lumber in a modern drawing-room; not but he excelled in all the refinements as well as &s;trength of conver&s;ation, and could, at times, badi|nage with great &s;kill and natural ea&s;e; but what are &s;uch qualifications to a people where cards and dice con&s;titute their bu&s;ine&s;s, and fa&s;hionable vices their conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>A character that would be, indeed, generally imi|tated if it had not arrived at a height di&s;couraging to human nature; that yielded to none of any age or country, as every virtue, public and private, every ability, had rai&s;ed it to the highe&s;t point of perfection of which our nature was found to be capable; which &s;tood, indeed, not only di&s;tingui&s;hed above tho&s;e of modern times, but added to the greatne&s;s of the greate&s;t of antiquity, the accumulated knowledge and accumulated wi&s;dom of the ages that have elap&s;ed, and the worlds that have been &s;ince di&s;covered, I cannot but lament that in a country di&s;tingui&s;hed by the birth and education of &s;uch a per&s;on, a coun|try for which had ri&s;qued his mo&s;t near, his mo&s;t advantageous intere&s;ts, &s;ome had been found who affected to regard him as an alien, and to deny him the rank of a friend and citizen.

<P>His learning is &s;o various and exten&s;ive, that we might prai&s;e it for its range and compa&s;s, were it not &s;till more prai&s;e-worthy for its &s;olidity and depth.

<HEAD>ACT OF GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>I NEVER reli&s;hed Acts of Grace, nor ever &s;ub|mitted to them but from de&s;pair of better. They are a di&s;honourable invention, by which, not from humanity, not from policy, but merely becau&s;e we have not room enough to hold the&s;e victims of the ab&s;urdity of our laws, we turn loo&s;e upon the public three or four thou&s;and naked wretches, corrupted by the habits, deba&s;ed by the ignominy, of a pri&s;on. If the creditor had a right to tho&s;e carca&s;es, as a natural claim for his property, I am &s;ure we have no right to deprive him of that &s;ecurity. But if the few pounds of fle&s;h were not nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ecurity, we had not a right to detain the unfortunate debtor, without any benefit at all to the per&s;on that confined him.</P>

Over the&s;e he has no power; they are impa&s;&s;ive and immortal. The audit of the Exchequer, more &s;evere than the audit to which the accountants are gone, demands proofs which in the nature of things are difficult, &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible to be had. In this re&s;pect too, rigour, as u&s;ual, defeats it&s;elf. Then, the Exchequer never gives a particular receipt, or clears a man of his account, as far as it goes. A final acquittance, (or a <HI>quietus,</HI> as they term it) is &s;carcely ever to be ob|tained. Terrors and gho&s;ts of unlaid accountants haunt the hou&s;es of their children from generation to generation. Families, in the cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, fall into minorities; the inheritance comes into the hands of females; and very perplexed affairs are often delivered over into the hands of negligent guardians and faithle&s;s &s;tewards. So that the demand remains, when the advantage of the money is gone, if ever any advantage at all has been made of it. This is a cau&s;e of infinite di&s;tre&s;s to families; and becomes a &s;ource of influence to an extent that can &s;carcely be imagined, but by tho&s;e who have taken &s;ome pains to trace it. The mildne&s;s of Govern|ment in the employment of u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous powers, furni&s;hes no rea&s;on for their continuance.</P>

<HEAD>AMBITION.</HEAD>
<P>GOD has planted in man a &s;en&s;e of ambition, and a &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the contemplation of his excelling his fellows in &s;omething deemed valuable among&s;t them. It is this pa&s;&s;ion that drives men to all the ways we &s;ee in u&s;e of &s;ignalizing them&s;elves, and that tends to make whatever excites in a man the idea of this di&s;tinction &s;o very plea&s;ant. It has been &s;o &s;trong as to make very mi&s;erable men take com|fort, that they were &s;upreme in mi&s;ery; and certain it is, that where we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves by &s;omething excellent, we begin to take a complacency in &s;ome &s;ingular infirmities, follies, or defects of one kind or other. It is on this principle that flattery is &s;o prevalent; for flattery is no more than what rai&s;es in a man's mind an idea of a preference which he has not. Now, whatever, either on good or upon bad grounds, tends to rai&s;e a man in his own opinion, produces a &s;ort of &s;welling and triumph, that is ex|tremely grateful to the human mind; and this &s;welling

The people, forgetful of all virtue and public &s;pirit, and intoxicated with the flatteries of their orators, (the&s;e courtiers of repub|lics, and endowed with the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tics of all other courtiers) this people, I &s;ay, at la&s;t arrived at that pitch of madne&s;s, that they coolly and deliberately, by an expre&s;s law, made it capital for any man to propo&s;e an application of the immen&s;e &s;ums &s;quandered in public &s;hows, even to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of the &s;tate.

<HEAD>AMERICAN WAR (EFFECTS OF).</HEAD>
<P>THE act of which I &s;peak is among the fruits of the American war: a war, in my humble opinion, productive of many mi&s;chiefs, of a kind which di&s;|tingui&s;h it from all others. Not only our policy is deranged, and our empire di&s;tracted, but our laws and our legi&s;lative &s;pirit appear to have been totally perverted by it. We have made war on our colonies, not by arms only, but by laws. As ho&s;|tility and law are not very concordant ideas, every &s;tep we have taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s, has been made by trampling on &s;ome maxim of ju&s;tice, or &s;ome capital principle of wi&s;e government. What pre|cedents were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and what principles over|turned,
<PB N="8" REF="148">
(I will not &s;ay of Engli&s;h privilege but of general ju&s;tice) in the Bo&s;ton Port, the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;et's Charter, the Military Bill, and all that long array of ho&s;tile acts of parliament, by which the war with America has been begun and &s;upported! Had the principles of any of the&s;e acts been fir&s;t exerted on Engli&s;h ground, they would probably have ex|pired as &s;oon as they touched it. But by being re|moved from our per&s;ons, they have rooted in our laws; and the late&s;t po&s;terity will ta&s;te the fruits of them.</P>
<P>Nor is it the wor&s;t effect of this unnatural con|tention, that our <HI>laws</HI> are corrupted. Whil&s;t <HI>man|ners</HI> remain intire, they will correct the vices of law, and &s;often it at length to their own temper. But we have to lament, that in mo&s;t of the late proceedings we &s;ee very few traces of that genero&s;ity, humanity, and dignity of mind which formerly characterized this nation. War &s;u&s;pends the rules of moral obli|gation, and what is long &s;u&s;pended is in danger of being totally abrogated. Civil wars &s;trike deepe&s;t of all into the manners of the people. They vitiate their politics; they corrupt their morals; they per|vert even the natural ta&s;te and reli&s;h of equity and ju&s;tice. By teaching us to con&s;ider our fellow-citizens in an ho&s;tile light, the whole body of our nation becomes gradually le&s;s dear to us. The very names of affection and kindred, which were the bond of charity whil&s;t we agreed, become new in|centives to hatred and rage, when the communion of our country is di&s;&s;olved. We may flatter our|&s;elves that we &s;hall not fall into this misfortune. But we have no charter of exemption, that I know of, from the ordinary frailties of our nature.</P>
<P>What but that blindne&s;s of heart which ari&s;es from the phren&s;y of civil contention, could have made any per&s;ons conceive the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h affairs as an object of triumph to them&s;elves, or of congratulation to their &s;overeign? Nothing,
<PB N="9" REF="149">
&s;urely, could be more lamentable to tho&s;e who re|member the flouri&s;hing days of this kingdom, than to &s;ee the in&s;ane joy of &s;everal unhappy people, amid&s;t the &s;ad &s;pectacle which our affairs and con|duct exhibit to the &s;corn of Europe. We behold, (and it &s;eems &s;ome people rejoice in beholding) our native land, which u&s;ed to &s;it the envied arbiter of all her neighbours, reduced to a &s;ervile dependence on their mercy; acquie&s;cing in a&s;&s;urances of friend|&s;hip which &s;he does not tru&s;t; complaining of ho&s;ti|lities which &s;he dares not re&s;ent; deficient to her allies; lofty to her &s;ubjects, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to her enemies; whil&s;t the liberal government of this free nation is &s;upported by the hireling &s;word of German boors and va&s;&s;als; and three millions of the &s;ubjects of Great Britain are &s;eeking for protection to Engli&s;h privileges in the arms of France!</P>
<P>Indeed our affairs are in a bad condition. I do a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e gentlemen who have prayed for war, and obtained the ble&s;&s;ing they have &s;ought, that they are, at this in&s;tant, in very great &s;traits.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Letter to the Sheriffs of Bri&s;tol.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>AMERICA. Effect of the Victory in Long I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>YOU remember, that in the beginning of this American war (that aera of calamity, di&s;grace and downfall, an aera which no feeling mind will ever

mention without a tear for England) you were greatly divided; and a very &s;trong body, if not the &s;tronge&s;t, oppo&s;ed it&s;elf to the madne&s;s which every art and every power were employed to render popular, in order that the errors of the rulers might be lo&s;t in the general blindne&s;s of the nation. This oppo&s;ition continued until after our great, but mo&s;t unfortunate victory at Long I&s;land. Then all the mounds and banks of our con&s;tancy were borne down at once; and the phren&s;y of the American war broke in upon us like a deluge. This victory, which &s;eemed to put an immediate end to all difficulties, perfected us in that &s;pirit of domination, which our unparalleled pro&s;perity had but too long nurtured. We had been &s;o very powerful, and &s;o very pro&s;perous, that even the humble&s;t of us were degraded into the vices and follies of kings. We lo&s;t all mea&s;ure between means and ends; and our headlong de&s;ires became our politics and our morals. All men who wi&s;hed for peace, or retained any &s;entiments of mo|deration, were overborne or &s;ilenced; and this city was led by every artifice (and probably with the more management, becau&s;e I was one of your mem|bers) to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf by its zeal for that fatal cau&s;e. In this temper of yours and of my mind, I &s;hould have &s;ooner fled to the extremities of the earth, than have &s;hewn my&s;elf here. I, who &s;aw in every American victory (for you have had a long &s;eries of the&s;e misfortunes) the germ and &s;eed of the naval power of France and Spain, which all our heat and warmth again&s;t America was only hatching into life, I &s;hould not have been a welcome vi&s;itant with the brow and the language of &s;uch feelings.</P>
<P>When afterwards, the other face of your calamity was turned upon you, and &s;hewed it&s;elf in defeat and di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hunned you full as much.

<HEAD>AMERICAN DESCENT.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, the people of the colonies are de&s;cendants of England. England, Sir, is a nation, which &s;till
<PB N="22" REF="162">
I hope re&s;pects, and formerly adored, her freedom. The coloni&s;ts emigrated from you, when this part of your character was mo&s;t predominant; and they took this bia&s;s and direction the moment they parted from your hands. They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to Engli&s;h ideas, and on Engli&s;h principles. Ab&s;tract liberty, like other mere ab&s;tractions, is not to be found. Liberty inheres in &s;ome &s;en&s;ible object; and every nation has formed to it&s;elf &s;ome favourite point, which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happine&s;s. It happened, you know, Sir, that the great conte&s;ts for freedom in this country were from the earlie&s;t times chiefly upon the que&s;tion of taxing. Mo&s;t of the conte&s;ts in the antient commonwealths turned pri|marily on the right of election of magi&s;trates; or on the balance among the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate. The que&s;tion of money was not with them &s;o imme|diate. But in England it was otherwi&s;e. On this point of taxes the able&s;t pens, and mo&s;t eloquent tongues, have been exerci&s;ed; the greate&s;t &s;pirits have acted and &s;uffered. In order to give the fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction concerning the importance of this point, it was not only nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who in argument defended the excellence of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, to in&s;i&s;t on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact, and to prove, that the right had been acknowledged in antient parchments, and blind u&s;ages, to re&s;ide in a certain body called an hou&s;e of commons. They went much further; they attempted to prove, and they &s;ucceeded, that in theory it ought to be &s;o, from the particular nature of a hou&s;e of commons, as an immediate repre&s;entative of the peo|ple; whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not. They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle, that, in all monarchies, the people mu&s;t in effect them&s;elves mediately or im|mediately po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of granting their own money, or no &s;hadow of liberty could &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The
<PB N="23" REF="163">
colonies draw from you, as with their life-blood, the&s;e ideas and principles. Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on this &s;pecific point of taxing. Liberty might be &s;afe, or might be endan|gered in twenty other particulars, without their being much plea&s;ed or alarmed. Here they felt its pul&s;e; and as they found that beat, they thought them&s;elves &s;ick or &s;ound. I do not &s;ay whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own ca&s;e. It is not ea&s;y indeed to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries. The fact is, that they did thus apply tho&s;e general arguments; and your mode of governing them, whether through lenity or indolence, through wi&s;dom or mi&s;take, confirmed them in the imagination, that they, as well as you, had an intere&s;t in the&s;e common principles.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></P>

In no country perhaps in the world is the law &s;o general a &s;tudy. The profe&s;|&s;ion it&s;elf is numerous and powerful; and in mo&s;t provinces it takes the lead. The greater number of the deputies &s;ent to the congre&s;s were lawyers. But all who read, and mo&s;t do read, endeavour to obtain &s;ome &s;mattering in that &s;cience. I have been told by an eminent book&s;eller, that in no branch of his bu&s;ine&s;s, after tracts of public devotion, were &s;o many books as tho&s;e on the law exported to the plan|tations. The coloni&s;ts have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own u&s;e. I hear that they have &s;old nearly as many of Black&s;tone's Commenta|ries in America as in England. General Gage marks out this di&s;po&s;ition very particularly in a letter on your table. He &s;tates, that all the people in his go|vernment are lawyers, or &s;matterers in law, and that in Bo&s;ton they have been enabled, by &s;ucce&s;sful chicane, wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal con&s;titutions. The &s;martne&s;s of debate will &s;ay, that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legi&s;lature, their obliga|tions to obedience, and the penalties of rebellion. All this is mighty well. But my <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Attorney General.</NOTE> honourabe and learned friend on the floor, who conde&s;cends to mark

what I &s;ay for animadver&s;ion, will di&s;dain that ground.

The fir&s;t, that there is already &s;o much un&s;ettled land in private hands, as to afford room for an immen&s;e future population, although the crown not only withheld its grants, but annihilated its &s;oil. If this be the ca&s;e, then the only effect of this avarice of de&s;olation, this hoarding of a royal wilderne&s;s, would be to rai&s;e the value of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the hands of the great private monopoli&s;ts, without any adequate check to the growing and alarming mi&s;chief of population.</P>

If you drive the people from one place, they will carry on their annual tillage, and remove with their flocks and herds to another. Many of the people in the back &s;ettlements are already little attached to particular &s;ituations. Already they have topped the Apalachian mountains. From thence they behold before them an immen&s;e plain, one va&s;t, rich, level meadow; a &s;quare of five hundred miles. Over this they would wander, without a po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;traint; they would change their manners with the habits of their life; would &s;oon forget a govern|ment, by which they were di&s;owned; would become hordes of Engli&s;h Tartars; and, pouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irre&s;i&s;tible cavalry, become ma&s;ters of your governors and your coun&s;ellors, your collectors and comptrollers, and of all the &s;laves that adhered to them.

<HEAD>BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ion which belongs to generation, merely as &s;uch, is lu&s;t only. This is evident in brutes, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are more unmixed, and which pur&s;ue their purpo&s;es more directly than ours. The only di&s;tinction they ob&s;erve with regard to their mates, is that of &s;ex. It is true, that they &s;tick &s;everally to their own &s;pecies in preference to all others. But this preference, I imagine, does not ari&s;e from any &s;en&s;e of beauty which they find in their &s;pecies, as Mr. Addi&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, but from a law of &s;ome other kind, to which they are &s;ubject; and this we may fairly conclude, from their apparent want of choice among&s;t tho&s;e objects to which the barriers of their &s;pecies have confined them. But man, who is a creature adapted to a greater variety and intricacy of relation, connects with the general pa&s;&s;ion, the idea of &s;ome <HI>&s;ocial</HI> qualities, which direct and heighten the appetite which he has in common with all other
<PB N="40" REF="180">
animals; and as he is not de&s;igned, like them, to live at large, it is fit that he &s;hould have &s;omething to create a preference, and fix his choice; and this, in general, &s;hould be &s;ome &s;en&s;ible quality; as no other can &s;o quickly, &s;o powerfully, or &s;o &s;urely produce its effect. The object, therefore, of this mixed pa&s;|&s;ion, which we call love, is the <HI>beauty</HI> of the <HI>&s;ex.</HI> Men are carried to the &s;ex in general, as it is the &s;ex, and by the common law of nature; but they are at|tached to particulars by per&s;onal <HI>beauty.</HI> I call beauty a &s;ocial quality; for where women and men, and not only they, but when other animals give us a &s;en&s;e of joy and plea&s;ure in beholding them (and there are many that do &s;o), they in&s;pire us with &s;en|timents of tenderne&s;s and affection towards their per&s;ons; we like to have them near us, and we enter willingly into a kind of relation with them, unle&s;s we &s;hould have &s;trong rea&s;ons to the contrary. But to what end, in many ca&s;es, this was de&s;igned, I am unable to di&s;cover; for I &s;ee no greater rea&s;on for a connection between man and &s;everal animals who are attired in &s;o engaging a manner, than between him and &s;ome others who entirely want this attraction, or po&s;&s;e&s;s it in a far weaker degree. But it is pro|bable, that Providence did not make even this di&s;|tinction, but with a view to &s;ome great end, though we cannot perceive di&s;tinctly what it is, as his wi&s;dom is not our wi&s;dom, nor our ways his ways.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>BRITISH LIBERTY, AN ENTAILED INHERITANCE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Magna Charta to the Declaration of Rights, it has been the uniform policy of our con&s;titution to claim and a&s;&s;i&s;t our liberties, as an entailed inheri|tance derived to us from our forefathers, and to be tran&s;mitted to our po&s;terity, as an e&s;tate &s;pecially be|longing to the people of this kingdom, without any reference whatever to any other more general or prior right. By this means our con&s;titution pre&s;erves an unity in &s;o great a diver&s;ity of its parts. We have an inheritable crown; an inheritable peerage; and an hou&s;e of commons and a people inheriting privi|leges, franchi&s;es, and liberties, from a long line of ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>This policy appears to me to be the re&s;ult of pro|found reflection, or rather the happy effect of fol|lowing nature, which is wi&s;dom without reflection, and above it. A &s;pirit of innovation is generally the re&s;ult of a &s;elfi&s;h temper and confined views. People will not look forward to po&s;terity, who never look backward to their ance&s;tors. Be&s;ides, the people of England well know, that the idea of inheritance fur|ni&s;hes a &s;ure principle of con&s;ervation, and a &s;ure principle of tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acqui&s;ition free,
<PB N="47" REF="187">
but it &s;ecures what it acquires. Whatever advantages are obtained by a &s;tate proceeding on the&s;e maxims, are locked fa&s;t as in a &s;ort of family &s;ettlement; gra&s;ped as in a kind of mortmain for ever. By a con&s;titutional policy, working after the pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we tran&s;mit our govern|ment and our privileges, in the &s;ame manner in which we enjoy and tran&s;mit our property and our lives. The in&s;titutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of Providence, are handed down to us and from us, in the &s;ame cour&s;e and order. Our political &s;y&s;tem is placed in a ju&s;t corre&s;pondence and &s;ym|metry with the order of the world, and with the mode of exi&s;tence decreed to a permanent body compo&s;ed of tran&s;itory parts; wherein, by the di&s;po&s;ition of a &s;tupendous wi&s;dom, moulding together the great my&s;terious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle-aged, or young, but in a condition of unchangeable con|&s;tancy, moves on through the varied tenor of per|petual decay, fall, renovation, and progre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Thus, by pre&s;erving the method of nature in the conduct of the &s;tate, in what we improve we are never wholly new; in what we retain, we are never wholly ob&s;olete. By adhering in this manner and on the&s;e principles to our forefathers, we are guided not by the &s;uper&s;tition of antiquarians, but by the &s;pirit of philo&s;ophic analogy. In this choice of in|heritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood; binding up the con&s;ti|tution of our country with our deare&s;t dome&s;tic ties; adopting our fundamental laws into the bo&s;om of our family affections; keeping in&s;eparable, and che|ri&s;hing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our &s;tate, our hearths, our &s;epulchres, and our altars.</P>
<P>Through the &s;ame plan of a conformity to nature in our artificial in&s;titutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful in&s;tincts, to fortify the
<PB N="48" REF="188">
fallible and feeble contrivances of our rea&s;on, we have derived &s;everal other, and tho&s;e no &s;mall be|nefits, from con&s;idering our liberties in the light of an inheritance. Always acting as if in the pre&s;ence of canonized forefathers, the &s;pirit of freedom, lead|ing in it&s;elf to mi&s;rule and exce&s;s, is tempered with an awful gravity. This idea of a liberal de&s;cent in|&s;pires us with a &s;en&s;e of habitual native dignity, which prevents that up&s;tart in&s;olence almo&s;t inevitably ad|hering to and di&s;gracing tho&s;e who are the fir&s;t ac|quirers of any di&s;tinction. By this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom. It carries an impo&s;ing and maje&s;tic a&s;pect; it has a pedigree and illu&s;trating ance&s;tors; it has its bearings and its en&s;igns armo|rials; it has its gallery of portraits; its monumental in&s;criptions; its records, evidences, and titles.

In all the&s;e old countries the &s;tate has been made to the people, and not the people conformed to the &s;tate. Every &s;tate has pur&s;ued, not only every &s;ort of &s;ocial advan|tage, but it has cultivated the welfare of every individual. His wants, his wi&s;hes, even his ta&s;tes have been con&s;ulted. This comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme, virtually produced a degree of per&s;onal liberty in forms the mo&s;t adver&s;e to it. That was found, under monarchies &s;tiled ab&s;olute, in a degree un|known to the ancient commonwealths. From hence the powers of all our modern &s;tates meet, in all their movements, with &s;ome ob&s;truction. It is therefore no wonder, that when the&s;e &s;tates are to be con&s;idered as machines to operate for &s;ome one great end, that this di&s;&s;ipated and balanced force is not ea&s;ily concentred, or made to bear upon one point.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Regicide Peace.</HI></BIBL></P>

This con&s;ecration is made, that all who ad|mini&s;ter in the government of men, in which they &s;tand in the per&s;on of God him&s;elf, &s;hould have high and worthy notions of their function and de&s;tination; that their hope &s;hould be full of immortality; that they &s;hould not look to the paltry pelf of the moment, nor to the temporary and tran&s;ient prai&s;e of the vulgar, but to a &s;olid, permanent exi&s;tence, in the permanent part of their nature, and to a permanent fame and glory, in the example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE AND CHARAC|TER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, (SEE KING'S MEN.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE my eye chiefly on the Hou&s;e of Commons. I hope I &s;hall be indulged in a few ob&s;ervations on the nature and character of that a&s;&s;embly; not with regard to its <HI>legal form and power,</HI> but to its <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and to the purpo&s;es it is meant to an&s;wer in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;uppo&s;ed originally to be <HI>no part of the &s;tanding government of this country.</HI> It was con&s;idered as a <HI>controul,</HI> i&s;&s;uing <HI>immediately</HI> from the people, and &s;peedily to be re&s;olved into the ma&s;s from whence it aro&s;e. In this re&s;pect it was in the higher part of government what juries are in the lower. The capacity of a magi&s;trate being tran&s;itory, and that of a citizen permanent, the latter capacity it was hoped would of cour&s;e preponderate in all di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, not only between the people and the &s;tanding authority of the crown, but between the people and the fleeting authority of the Hou&s;e of Commons it&s;elf. It was hoped that, being of a middle nature between &s;ubject and government, they would feel with a more tender and a nearer intere&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="196">
every thing that concerned the people, than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Whatever alterations time and the nece&s;&s;ary ac|commodation of bu&s;ine&s;s may have introduced, this character can never be &s;u&s;tained, unle&s;s the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hall be made to bear &s;ome &s;tamp of the actual di&s;po&s;ition of the people at large. It would (among public misfortunes) be an evil more natural and tolerable, that the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould be infected with every <HI>epidemical phren&s;y</HI> of the people, as this would indicate <HI>&s;ome con&s;anguinity, &s;ome &s;ympathy</HI> of nature with their con&s;tituents, than that they &s;hould in all ca&s;es be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors. By this want of &s;ympathy they would cea&s;e to be an Hou&s;e of Com|mons. For it is not the derivation of the power of that Hou&s;e from the people, which makes it in a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e their repre&s;entative. The King is the repre&s;entative of the people; &s;o are the lords; &s;o are the judges. They all are tru&s;tees for the people, as well as the Commons; becau&s;e no power is given for the &s;ole &s;ake of the holder; and although go|vernment certainly is an in&s;titution of divine autho|rity, yet its forms, and the per&s;ons who admini&s;ter it, all originate from the people.</P>
<P>A popular origin cannot therefore be the charac|teri&s;tical di&s;tinction of a popular repre&s;entative. This belongs equally to all parts of government, and in all forms. The virtue, &s;pirit, and e&s;&s;ence of a Hou&s;e of Commons con&s;i&s;ts in its being the expre&s;s image of the feelings of the nation. It was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed to be a controul <HI>upon</HI> the people, as of late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> been taught, by a doctrine of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency. It was de&s;igned as a controul <HI>for</HI> the people. Other in&s;titutions have been formed for the purpo&s;e of checking popular exce&s;&s;es; and they are, I apprehend, fully adequate to their object. If not, they ought to be made &s;o. The Hou&s;e of Commons, as it was never intended for the &s;upport of
<PB N="57" REF="197">
peace and &s;ubordination, is mi&s;erably appointed for that &s;ervice; having no &s;tronger weapon than its mace, and no better officer than its &s;erjeant at arms, which it can command of its own proper authority.

But an addre&s;&s;ing Hou&s;e of Commons, and a petitioning nation; an Hou&s;e of Commons full of confidence, when the nation is plunged in de&s;pair; in the utmo&s;t harmony with mini&s;ters, whom the people regard with the utmo&s;t abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant, when the general voice demands account; who, in all di&s;putes between the people and admini&s;tration, pre&s;ume again&s;t the people; who puni&s;h their di&s;orders, but refu&s;e even to inquire into the provocations to them; this is an unnatural, a mon&s;trous &s;tate of things in this con&s;titution.

He became at length &s;o confident of his force, &s;o collected in his might, that he made no &s;ecret what&s;oever of his dreadful re&s;olution. Having terminated his di&s;putes with every enemy, and every rival, who buried their mutual animo&s;ities in their common dete&s;tation again&s;t the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a &s;avage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of de&s;truction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havock, and de&s;olation, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains. Whil&s;t the authors of all the&s;e evils were idly and &s;tupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their horizon, it &s;uddenly bur&s;t, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic. Then en&s;ued a &s;cene of woe, the like of which no eye had &s;een, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of war before known or heard of, were mercy to that new havock. A &s;torm of univer&s;al fire bla&s;ted every field, con&s;umed every hou&s;e, de&s;troyed every temple. The mi&s;erable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages, in part were &s;laughtered; others, without regard to &s;ex, to age, to the re&s;pect of rank, or &s;acredne&s;s of function; fathers torn from children, hu&s;bands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amid&s;t the goading &s;pears of drivers, and the trampling of pur&s;uing hor&s;es, were &s;wept into captivity, in an unknown and ho&s;tile land.

<P>The Carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile &s;oil. The general &s;ize of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwi&s;e. It is &s;ome days &s;ince I moved, that a curious and intere&s;ting map, kept in the India Hou&s;e, &s;hould be laid before you. The India Hou&s;e is not yet in readine&s;s to &s;end it; I have therefore brought down my own copy, and there it lies for the u&s;e of any gentleman who may think &s;uch a matter worthy of his attention. It is indeed a noble map, and of noble things; but it is deci&s;ive again&s;t the golden dreams and &s;anguine &s;peculations of avarice run mad.

&s;eed, &s;tock, capital) that map will &s;hew you, that the u&s;e of the influences of Heaven it&s;elf, are in that country a work of art. The Carnatic is refre&s;hed by few or no living brooks or running &s;treams, and it has rain only at a &s;ea&s;on; but its product of rice exacts the u&s;e of water &s;ubject to perpetual com|mand. This is the national bank of the Carnatic, on which it mu&s;t have a perpetual credit, or it peri&s;he irretrievably. For that rea&s;on, in the happier times of India, a number almo&s;t incredible of re&s;er|voirs have been made in cho&s;en places throughout the whole country; they are formed, for the greater part, of mounds of earth and &s;tones, with &s;luices of &s;olid ma&s;onry; the whole con&s;tructed with admirable &s;kill and labour, and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map (Mr. Barnard's map of the Jaghire) alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the re&s;ervoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit.

<P>What, Sir, would a virtuous and enlightened mi|ni&s;try do on the view of the ruins of &s;uch works be|fore them?

They would have reduced all their mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary e&s;tabli&s;hments; they would have &s;u&s;pended the ju&s;te&s;t payments; they would have employed every &s;hilling derived from the producing to re-animate the powers of the unproductive parts. While they were performing this fundamental duty, whil&s;t they were celebrating the&s;e my&s;teries of ju&s;tice and humanity, they would have told the corps of <HI>fictitious creditors,</HI> who&s;e crimes were their claims, that they mu&s;t keep an awful di&s;tance; that they mu&s;t &s;ilence their inau&s;picious tongues; that they mu&s;t hold off their profane unhallowed paws from this holy work; they would have proclaimed with a voice that &s;hould make it&s;elf heard, that on every country the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> creditor is the <HI>plow</HI>; that this original, indefea&s;i|ble claim &s;uper&s;edes every other demand.</P>
<P>This is what a wi&s;e and virtuous mini&s;try would have done and &s;aid. This, therefore, is what our mini&s;ter could never think of &s;aying or doing.

<HEAD>CABINET (THE DOUBLE.)</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be remembered, that &s;ince the revolution, until the period we are &s;peaking of, the influence of the crown had been always employed in &s;upporting the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and in carrying on the public bu&s;ine&s;s according to their opinions. But the party now in que&s;tion is formed upon a very different idea. It is to intercept the favour, protection and confi|dence of the crown in the pa&s;&s;age to its mini&s;ters; it is to come between them and their importance in par|liament; it is to &s;eparate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies; it is intended as con|troul, not the &s;upport, of admini&s;tration. The ma+chinery of this &s;y&s;tem is perplexed in its movements, and fal&s;e in its principle. It is formed on a &s;uppo&s;i+tion that the king is &s;omething external to his govern|ment; and that he may be honoured and aggrandized, even by its debility and di&s;grace. The plan pro|ceeds expre&s;sly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power. It proceeds on the idea of weak|ening the &s;tate in order to &s;trengthen the court. The &s;cheme depending entirely on di&s;tru&s;t, on di&s;connec|tion,
<PB N="66" REF="206">
on mutability by principle, on &s;y&s;tematic weak|ne&s;s in every particular member; it is impo&s;&s;ible that the total re&s;ult &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tantial &s;trength of any kind.</P>
<P>As a foundation of their &s;cheme, the cabal have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of <HI>rota</HI> in the court. All &s;orts of parties, by this means, have been brought into admi|ni&s;tration, from whence few have had the good for|tune to e&s;cape without di&s;grace; none at all without con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es. In the beginning of each ar|rangement no profe&s;&s;ions of confidence and &s;upport are wanting, to induce the leading men to engage. But while the mini&s;ters of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power, while they have all their canvas &s;pread out to the wind, and every &s;ail filled with the fair and pro&s;perous gale of royal favour, in a &s;hort time they find, they know not how, a cur|rent, which &s;ets directly again&s;t them; which pre|vents all progre&s;s; and even drives them backwards. They grow a&s;hamed and mortified in a &s;ituation, which, by its vicinity to power, only &s;erves to re|mind them the more &s;trongly of their in&s;ignificance. They are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors, or to &s;ee them&s;elves oppo&s;ed by the natural in&s;truments of their office. With the lo&s;s of their dignity they lo&s;e their temper. In their turn they grow trouble&s;ome to that cabal, which, whether it &s;upports or oppo&s;es, equally di&s;graces and equally betrays them. It is &s;oon found nece&s;&s;ary to get rid of the heads of admini&s;tration; but it is of the heads only. As there always are many rotten members belonging to the be&s;t connections, it is not hard to per&s;uade &s;everal to continue in office without their leaders. By this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in; and is only reduced in &s;trength by its temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power. Be|&s;ides, if by accident, or in cour&s;e of changes, that power &s;hould be recovered, the junto have thrown up a retrenchment of the&s;e carca&s;es, which may &s;erve
<PB N="67" REF="207">
to cover them&s;elves in a day of danger. They con|clude, not unwi&s;ely, that &s;uch rotten members will become the fir&s;t objects of di&s;gu&s;t and re&s;entment to their antient connexions.</P>
<P>They contrive to form in the outward admini&s;tra|tion two parties at the lea&s;t; which, whil&s;t they are tearing one another to pieces, are both competitors for the favour and protection of the cabal; and, by their emulation, contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior ma|nagers.</P>
<P>A mini&s;ter of &s;tate will &s;ometimes keep him&s;elf totally e&s;tranged from all his colleagues; will differ from them in their councils, will privately traver&s;e, and publicly oppo&s;e, their mea&s;ures, He will, how|ever, continue in his employment. In&s;tead of &s;uf|fering any mark of di&s;plea&s;ure, he will be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by an unbounded profu&s;ion of court rewards and care&s;&s;es; becau&s;e he does what is expected, and all that is expected, from men in office. He helps to keep &s;ome form of admini&s;tration in being, and keeps it at the &s;ame time as weak and divided as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>However, we mu&s;t take care not to be mi&s;taken, or to imagine that &s;uch per&s;ons have any weight in their oppo&s;ition. When, by them, admini&s;tration is convinced of its in&s;ignificancy, they are &s;oon to be convinced of their own. They never are &s;uffered to &s;ucceed in their oppo&s;ition. They and the world are to be &s;atisfied, that, neither office, nor authority, nor property, nor ability, eloquence, coun&s;el, &s;kill, or union, are of the lea&s;t importance; but that the mere influence of the court, naked of all &s;upport, and de&s;titute of all management, is abundantly &s;uffi|cient for all its own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>When any adver&s;e connexion is to be de&s;troyed, the cabal &s;eldom appear in the work them&s;elves. They find out &s;ome per&s;on of whom the party enter|tains an high opinion. Such a per&s;on they endeavour
<PB N="68" REF="208">
to delude with various pretences. They teach him fir&s;t to di&s;tru&s;t, and then to quarrel with his friends; among whom, by the &s;ame arts, they excite a &s;imilar diffidence of him; &s;o that, in this mutual fear and di&s;tru&s;t, he may &s;uffer him&s;elf to be employed as the in&s;trument in the change which is brought about. Afterwards they are &s;ure to de&s;troy him in his turn, by &s;etting up in his place &s;ome per&s;on in whom he had him&s;elf repo&s;ed the greate&s;t confidence, and who &s;erves to carry off a con&s;iderable part of his adhe|rents.</P>
<P>As in de&s;troying their enemies they make u&s;e of in&s;truments not immediately belonging to their corps, &s;o in advancing their own friends they pur&s;ue exactly the &s;ame method. To promote any of them to con|&s;iderable rank or emolument, they commonly take care that the recommendation &s;hall pa&s;s through the hands of the often&s;ible mini&s;try: &s;uch a recommen|dation might however appear to the world, as &s;ome proof of the credit of mini&s;ters, and &s;ome means of increa&s;ing their &s;trength. To prevent this, the per|&s;ons &s;o advanced are directed, in all companies, in|du&s;triou&s;ly to declare, that they are under no obli|gations what&s;oever to admini&s;tration; that they have received their office from another quarter; that they are totally free and independent.</P>
<P>When the faction has any job of lucre to obtain, or of vengeance to perpetrate, their way is, to &s;elect, for the execution, tho&s;e very per&s;ons to who&s;e habits, friend&s;hips, principles, and declarations, &s;uch pro|ceedings are publicly known to be the mo&s;t adver&s;e; at once to render the in&s;truments the more odious, and therefore the more dependent, and to prevent the people from ever repo&s;ing a confidence in any appearance of private friend&s;hip, or public principle.</P>
<P>If the admini&s;tration &s;eem now and then, from re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or from fear of making them&s;elves di&s;|agreeable, to &s;uffer any popular exce&s;&s;es to go un|puni&s;hed, the cabal immediately &s;ets up &s;ome creature
<PB N="69" REF="209">
of theirs to rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t the mini&s;ters, as having &s;hamefully betrayed the dignity of govern|ment. Then they compel the mini&s;try to become active in conferring rewards and honours on the per|&s;ons who have been the in&s;truments of their di&s;grace; and, after having fir&s;t vilified them with the higher orders for &s;uffering the laws to &s;leep over the licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of the populace, they drive them (in order to make amends for their former inactivity) to &s;ome act of atrocious violence, which renders them com|pletely abhorred by the people.</P>
<P>They who remember the riots which attended the Middle&s;ex election; the opening of the pre&s;ent par|liament; and the tran&s;actions relative to Saint George's Fields, will not be at a lo&s;s for an appli|cation of the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>That this body may be enabled to compa&s;s all the ends of its in&s;titution, its members are &s;carcely ever to aim at the high and re&s;pon&s;ible offices of the &s;tate. They are di&s;tributed with art and judgment through all the &s;econdary, but efficient, departments of office, and through the hou&s;eholds of all the branches of the royal family: &s;o as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne; and on the other to for|ward or fru&s;trate the execution of any mea&s;ure, according to their own intere&s;ts. For with the credit and &s;upport which they are known to have, though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excu&s;e for &s;alary, they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the influence of the highe&s;t po&s;ts; and they dictate publicly in almo&s;t every thing, even with a parade of &s;uperiority. Whenever they di&s;&s;ent (as it often happens) from their nominal leaders, the trained part of the &s;enate, in&s;tinctively in the &s;ecret, is &s;ure to follow them; provided the leaders, &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation, do not of them&s;elves recede in time from their mo&s;t declared opinions. This latter is generally the ca&s;e. It will not be conceivable to any one who has not &s;een it, what plea&s;ure is taken by the cabal in ren|dering
<PB N="70" REF="210">
the&s;e heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous. And when they are become &s;o, they have then the be&s;t chance for being well &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>The members of the court faction are fully indem|nified for not holding places on the &s;lippery heights of the kingdom, not only by the lead in all affairs, but al&s;o by the perfect &s;ecurity in which they enjoy le&s;s con&s;picuous, but very advantageous &s;ituations. Their places are, in expre&s;s legal tenure, or in effect, all of them for life. Whil&s;t the fir&s;t and mo&s;t re|&s;pectable per&s;ons in the kingdom are to&s;&s;ed about like tennis balls, the &s;port of a blind and in&s;olent caprice, no mini&s;ter dares even to ca&s;t an oblique glance at the lowe&s;t of their body. If an attempt be made upon one of this corps, immediately he flies to &s;anctuary, and pretends to the mo&s;t inviolable of all promi&s;es. No conveniency of public arrange|ment is available to remove any one of them from the &s;pecific &s;ituation he holds; and the &s;lighte&s;t at|tempt upon one of them, by the mo&s;t powerful mi|ni&s;ter, is a certain preliminary to his own de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of their independence, they bear them|&s;elves with a lofty air to the exterior mini&s;ters. Like Jani&s;&s;aries, they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their &s;ervitude. They may act ju&s;t as they plea&s;e; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their in&s;titution. It is, therefore, not at all wonderful, that people &s;hould be &s;o de&s;irous of adding them&s;elves to that body, in which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s and reconcile &s;atisfactions the mo&s;t alluring, and &s;eemingly the mo&s;t contradictory; enjoying at once all the &s;pirited plea&s;ure of indepen|dence, and all the gro&s;s lucre and &s;at emoluments of &s;ervitude.</P>

<P>THERE are two capital faults in our law with re|lation to civil debts. One is, that every man is pre|&s;umed &s;olvent. A pre&s;umption, in innumerable ca&s;es, directly again&s;t truth. Therefore the debtor is ordered, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of ability and fraud, to be coerced his liberty until he makes payment. By this means, in all ca&s;es of civil in&s;olvency without a pardon from his creditor, he is to be impri&s;oned for life:&mdash;and thus a mi&s;erable mi&s;taken invention of artificial &s;cience, operates to change a civil into a criminal judgment, and to &s;courge misfortune or in|di&s;cretion with a puni&s;hment which the law does not inflict on the greate&s;t crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="215">The next fault is, that the inflicting of that puni&s;h|ment is not on the opinion of an equal and public judge; but is referred to the arbitrary di&s;cretion of a private, nay intere&s;ted, and irritated individual. He, who formally is, and &s;ub&s;tantially ought to be, the judge, is in reality no more than mini&s;terial, a mere executive in&s;trument of a private man, who is at once judge and party. Every idea of judicial order is &s;ub|verted by this procedure. If the in&s;olvency be no crime, why is it puni&s;hed with arbitrary impri&s;onment? If it be a crime, why is it delivered into private hands to pardon without di&s;cretion, or to puni&s;h without mercy and without mea&s;ure?&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Speech previous to the Election at Bri&s;tol.</HI></BIBL></P>

France has not &s;acrificed her virtue to her intere&s;t; but &s;he has abandoned her intere&s;t, that &s;he might pro&s;titute her virtue.

Sovereigns will con&s;ider tho&s;e who advi&s;e them to place an unlimited confi|dence in their people, as &s;ubverters of their thrones; as traitors who aim at their de&s;truction, by leading their ea&s;y good-nature, under &s;pecious pretences, to admit combinations of bold and faithle&s;s men into a participation of their power. This alone (if there were nothing el&s;e) is an irreparable calamity to you and to mankind. Remember that your parliament of Paris told your king, that in calling the &s;tates to|gether, he had nothing to fear but the prodigal exce&s;s of their zeal in providing for the &s;upport of the

<P>YOU had before your revolution about one hun|dred and twenty bi&s;hops. A few of them were men of eminent &s;anctity. When we talk of the heroic, of cour&s;e we talk of rare virtue. I believe the in|&s;tances of eminent depravity may be as rare among&s;t them as tho&s;e of tran&s;cendent goodne&s;s. Examples of avarice and of licentiou&s;ne&s;s may be picked out, I do not que&s;tion it, by tho&s;e who delight in the in|ve&s;tigation which leads to &s;uch di&s;coveries. A man, as old as I am, will not be a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;everal, in every de&s;cription, do not lead that perfect life of &s;elf-denial, with regard to wealth or to plea&s;ure, which is wi&s;hed for by all, by &s;ome expected, but by none exacted with more rigour, than by tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t attentive to their own intere&s;ts, or the mo&s;t indulgent to their own pa&s;&s;ions. When I was in France, I am certain that the number of vici|ous prelates was not great. Certain individuals among them, not di&s;tingui&s;hable for the regularity of their lives, made &s;ome amends for their want of the &s;evere virtues, in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the liberal; and were endowed with qualities which made them u&s;eful in the church and &s;tate. I am told, that with few exceptions, Louis the Sixteenth had been more attentive to character, in his promotions to that rank, than his immediate predece&s;&s;or; and I believe, (as &s;ome &s;pirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign) that it may be true. But the pre&s;ent ruling power has &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition only to plunder the church. It has puni&s;hed <HI>all</HI> prelates; which is to favour the vicious, at lea&s;t, in point of reputa|tion. It has made a degrading pen&s;ionary e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, to which no man, of liberal ideas, or liberal condition will de&s;tine his children. It mu&s;t &s;ettle into the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the people. As with you the inferior clergy are not numerous enough for their duties; as the&s;e duties are, beyond mea&s;ure, minute
<PB N="88" REF="228">
and toil&s;ome; as you have left no middle cla&s;&s;es of clergy at their ea&s;e, in future nothing of &s;cience or erudition can exi&s;t in the Gallican church. To complete the project, without the lea&s;t attention to the rights of patrons, the a&s;&s;embly has provided in future an elective clergy; an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical profe&s;&s;ion all men of &s;o|briety; all who can pretend to independence in their function or their conduct; and which will throw the whole direction of the public mind into the hands of a &s;et of licentious, bold, crafty, factious, flattering wretches, of &s;uch condition and &s;uch habits of life as will make their contemptible pen&s;ions (in com|pari&s;on of which the &s;tipend of an exci&s;eman is lu|crative and honourable) an object of low and illiberal intrigue. Tho&s;e officers, whom they &s;till call bi&s;hops, are to be elected to a provi&s;ion comparatively mean, through the &s;ame arts, (that is, electioneering arts) by men of all religious tenets that are known or can be invented. The new lawgivers have not a&s;certained any thing what&s;oever concerning their qualifications, relative either to doctrine or to morals; no more than they have done with regard to the &s;ubordinate clergy; nor does it appear but that both the higher and the lower may, at their di&s;cretion, practi&s;e or preach any mode of religion or irreligion that they plea&s;e.

<P>WHEN my occa&s;ions took me into France, to|wards the clo&s;e of the late reign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a con&s;iderable part of my curio&s;ity. So far from finding (except from one &s;et of men, not then very numerous, though very active) the complaints and di&s;contents again&s;t that body,
<PB N="89" REF="229">
which &s;ome publications had given me rea&s;on to expect, I perceived little or no public or private unea&s;ine&s;s on their account. On further examina|tion, I found the clergy in general, per&s;ons of mode|rate minds and decorous manners; I include the &s;e|culars, and the regulars of both &s;exes. I had not the good fortune to know a great many of the paro|chial clergy; but in general I received a perfectly good account of their morals, and of their attention to their duties. With &s;ome of the higher clergy I had a per&s;onal acquaintance; and of the re&s;t in that cla&s;s, very good means of information. They were, almo&s;t all of them, per&s;ons of noble birth. They re&s;embled others of their own rank; and where there was any difference, it was in their favour. They were more fully educated than the military noble&s;&s;e; &s;o as by no means to di&s;grace their profe&s;&s;ion by ig|norance, or by want of fitne&s;s for the exerci&s;e of their authority. They &s;eemed to me, beyond the clerical character, liberal and open; with the hearts of gen|tlemen, and men of honour; neither in&s;olent nor &s;ervile in their manners and conduct. They &s;eemed to me rather a &s;uperior cla&s;s; a &s;et of men, among&s;t whom you would not be &s;urprized to find a <HI>Fenelon.</HI> I &s;aw among the clergy in Paris (many of the de|&s;cription are not to be met with any where) men of great learning and candour; and I had rea&s;on to be|lieve, that this de&s;cription was not confined to Paris. What I found in other places, I know was accidental; and therefore to be pre&s;umed a fair &s;ample. I &s;pent a few days in a provincial town, where, in the ab&s;ence of the bi&s;hop, I pa&s;&s;ed my evenings with three cler|gymen, his vicars general, per&s;ons who would have done honour to any church. They were all well in|formed; two of them of deep, general, and exten&s;ive erudition, ancient and modern, oriental and we&s;tern; particularly in their own profe&s;&s;ion. They had a more exten&s;ive knowledge of our Engli&s;h divines than I expected; and they entered into the genius of tho&s;e

writers with a critical accuracy. One of the&s;e gen|tlemen is &s;ince dead, the Abb&eacute; <HI>Morangis.</HI> I pay this tribute, without reluctance, to the memory of that noble, reverend, learned, and excellent per&s;on; and I &s;hould do the &s;ame, with equal chearfulne&s;s, to the merits of the others, who, I believe, are &s;till liv|ing, if I did not fear to hurt tho&s;e whom I am unable to &s;erve.</P>

This power is called imagination; and to this belongs whatever is called wit, fancy, invention, and the like.

Now the imagination is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive province of plea&s;ure and pain, as it is the region of our fears and our hopes, and of all our pa&s;&s;ions that are connected with them; and whatever is calculated to affect the imagination with the&s;e commanding ideas, by force of any original natural impre&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t have the &s;ame power pretty equally over all men.

<HEAD>INDIA COMPANY. Conduct to the Polygars, or native Princes of the Car|natic. (See CARNATIC.)</HEAD>
<P>IT is only to complete the view I propo&s;ed of the conduct of the company, with regard to the depen|dent provinces, that I &s;hall &s;ay <HI>any</HI> thing at all of the Carnatic, which is the &s;cene, if po&s;&s;ible, of greater di&s;order than the northern provinces. Perhaps it were better to &s;ay of this center and metropolis of abu&s;e, whence all the re&s;t in India and in England diverge; from whence they are &s;ed and methodized, what was &s;aid of Carthage&mdash;<HI>de Carthagine &s;atius e&s;t &s;ilere quam parum dicere.</HI> This country, in all its denominations, is about 46,000 &s;quare miles. It may be affirmed univer&s;ally, that not one per&s;on of &s;ub&s;tance or property, landed, commercial, or mo|nied, excepting two or three bankers, who are nece&s;|&s;ary depo&s;its and di&s;tributors of the general &s;poil, is left in all that region. In that country the moi&s;ture, the bounty of Heaven, is given but at a certain &s;ea&s;on. Before the aera of our influence, the indu&s;try of man carefully hu&s;banded that gift of God. The Gent&ucirc;s pre&s;erved, with a provident and religious care, the precious depo&s;it of the periodical rain in re&s;ervoirs, many of them works of royal grandeur; and from the&s;e, as occa&s;ion demanded, they fructified the whole country. To maintain the&s;e re&s;ervoirs, and to keep up an annual advance to the cultivators, for &s;eed and cattle, formed a principal object of the piety and policy of the prie&s;ts and rulers of the Gent&ucirc; religion.</P>
<P>This object required a command of money; and there was no pollam, or ca&s;tle, which in the happy days of the Carnatic was without &s;ome hoard of trea|&s;ure, by which the governors were enabled to combat with the irregularity of the &s;ea&s;ons, and to re&s;i&s;t or to buy off the inva&s;ion of an enemy. In all the cities were multitudes of merchants and bankers, for all occa&s;ions of monied a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and on the other hand, the native princes were in condition to obtain
<PB N="114" REF="254">
credit from them. The manufacturer was paid by the return of commodities, or by imported money, and not, as at pre&s;ent, in the taxes that had been originally exacted from his indu&s;try. In aid of ca&s;ual di&s;tre&s;s, the country was full of choultries, which were inns and ho&s;pitals, where the traveller and the poor were relieved. All ranks of people had their place in the public concern, and their &s;hare in the common &s;tock and common pro&s;perity; but <HI>the chartered rights of men,</HI> and the right which it was thought proper to &s;et up in the Nabob of Arcot, introduced a new &s;y&s;tem. It was their policy to con&s;ider hoards of money as crimes; to regard mo|derate rents as frauds on the &s;overeign; and to view, in the le&s;&s;er princes, any claim of exemption from more than &s;ettled tribute, as an act of rebellion. Accordingly all the ca&s;tles were, one after the other, plundered and de&s;troyed. The native princes were expelled; the ho&s;pitals fell to ruin; the re&s;ervoirs of water went to decay; the merchants, bankers, and manufacturers di&s;appeared; and &s;terility, indigence, and depopulation, over&s;pread the face of the&s;e once flouri&s;hing provinces.</P>
<P>The company was very early &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, and of their true cau&s;e. They gave preci&s;e orders,
<Q REND="inline">"that the native princes, called polygars, &s;hould <HI>not be extirpated.</HI>&mdash;That the rebellion [&s;o they choo&s;e to call it] of the polygars, may (they fear) <HI>with too much ju&s;tice,</HI> be attributed to the mal|admini&s;tration of the Nabob's collectors." That
 "they ob&s;erve with concern, that their troops have been put to <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI> &s;ervices."</Q>
They might have u&s;ed a &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion without impropriety. But they make amends in another place. Speaking of the polygars, the directors &s;ay, that

They &s;tate, that the wars in which he has involved the Carnatic, had been a cau&s;e of its di&s;tre&s;&s;es.
<Q REND="inline">"That the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es have been certainly great; but tho&s;e by <HI>the Nabob's op|pre&s;&s;ions</HI> we believe <HI>to be greater than all.</HI>"</Q>
Pray, Sir, attend to the rea&s;on for their opinion that the government of this their in&s;trument is more calamitous to the country than the ravages of war.&mdash;Becau&s;e, &s;ay they, his oppre&s;&s;ions are
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>without intermi&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;The others are temporary; by all which <HI>oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> we believe the Nabob has great wealth in &s;tore."</Q>
From this &s;tore neither he nor they could derive any advantage what&s;oever, upon the inva&s;ion of Hyder Ali in the hour of their greate&s;t calamity and di&s;may.</P>
<P>It is now proper to compare the&s;e declarations with the company's conduct. The principal rea&s;on which they a&s;&s;igned again&s;t the <HI>extirpation</HI> of the polygars was, that the <HI>weavers</HI> were protected in their for|tre&s;&s;es. They might have added, that the company it&s;elf, which &s;lung them to death, had been warmed in the bo&s;om of the&s;e unfortunate princes: for, on the taking of Madras by the French, it was in their ho&s;pitable pollams, that mo&s;t of the inhabitants found refuge and protection. But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e orders, rea&s;ons, and declarations, they at length gave an indirect &s;anction, and permitted the u&s;e of a very direct and irre&s;i&s;tible force, to mea&s;ures which they had, over and over again, declared to be fal&s;e policy, cruel, inhuman, and oppre&s;&s;ive. Hav|ing, however, forgot all attention to the princes and the people, they remembered that they had &s;ome &s;ort of intere&s;t in the trade of the country; and it is matter of curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve the protection which they afforded to this their natural object.</P>
<P>Full of anxious cares on this head, they direct,
<Q REND="inline">"that in reducing the polygars they (their &s;ervants) were to be <HI>cautious,</HI> not to deprive the <HI>weavers and</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="256">
<HI>manufacturers</HI> of the protection they often met with in the &s;trong holds of the polygar countries;"</Q>&mdash;and they write to their in&s;trument, the Nabob of Arcot, concerning the&s;e poor people in a mo&s;t pathetic &s;train.

When they root out the protectors in favour of the oppre&s;&s;or, they &s;hew them&s;elves religiou&s;ly cautious of the rights of the protected.

<HEAD>INDIA PROVINCES (STATE OF). Bengal.</HEAD>
<P>BENGAL, and the provinces that are united to it, are larger than the kingdom of France; and once contained, as France does contain, a great and inde|pendent landed intere&s;t, compo&s;ed of princes, of great lords, of a numerous nobility and gentry, of freeholders, of lower tenants, of religious commu|nities, and public foundations. So early as 1769, the company's &s;ervants perceived the decay into which the&s;e provinces had fallen under Engli&s;h admi|ni&s;tration, and they made a &s;trong repre&s;entation upon this decay, and what they apprehended to be the cau&s;es of it. Soon after this repre&s;entation, Mr. Ha&s;tings became pre&s;ident of Bengal. In&s;tead of admini&s;tering a remedy to this melancholy di&s;order, upon the heels of a dreadful famine, in the year 1772, the &s;uccour which the new pre&s;ident and the council lent to this afflicted nation was&mdash;&s;hall I be believed in relating it?&mdash;the landed intere&s;t of a whole kingdom, of a kingdom to be compared to France, was &s;et up to public auction!

(Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;et up) the whole nobility, gentry, and freeholders, to the highe&s;t bidder. No preference was given to the ancient proprietors.

In this general calamity, &s;everal of the fir&s;t nobility thought (and in all appearance ju&s;tly) that they had better &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ity of this pen&s;ion, than continue, under the name of ze|mindars, the objects and in&s;truments of a &s;y&s;tem, by which they ruined their tenants, and were ruined them&s;elves. Another reform has &s;ince come upon the back of the fir&s;t; and a pen&s;ion having been a&s;&s;igned to the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons, in lieu of their hereditary lands, a new &s;cheme of oeconomy has taken place, and deprived them of that pen&s;ion.</P>

Sir, I will not now trouble you with any detail with regard to what they have &s;ince done with the&s;e &s;ame lands and land-holders; only to inform you, that nothing has been &s;uffered to &s;ettle for two &s;ea&s;ons together upon any ba&s;is; and that the levity and incon&s;tancy of the&s;e mock legi&s;lators were not the lea&s;t afflicting parts of the oppre&s;&s;ions &s;uffered under their u&s;urpation; nor will any thing give &s;tability to the property of the natives, but an admini&s;tration in England at once protecting and &s;table.

<P>In my opinion the courage of the mini&s;ter was the mo&s;t wonderful part of the tran&s;action, e&s;pecially as he mu&s;t have read, or rather the right honourable gentleman &s;ays, he has read for him, whole volumes upon the &s;ubject. The volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part &s;o numerous as the right ho|nourable gentleman has thought proper to pretend, in order to frighten you from enquiry; but in the&s;e vo|lumes, &s;uch as they are, the mini&s;ter mu&s;t have found a full authority for a &s;u&s;picion (at the very lea&s;t) of every thing relative to the great fortunes made at Madras. What is that authority? Why no other than the &s;tanding authority for all the claims which the mini&s;try has thought fit to provide for&mdash;the grand debtor&mdash;the nabob of Arcot him&s;elf. Hear that prince, in the letter written to the court of directors, at the preci&s;e period, whil&s;t the main body of the&s;e debts were contracting. In this letter he &s;tates him|&s;elf to be, what undoubtedly he is, a mo&s;t compe|tent witne&s;s to this point. After &s;peaking of the war with Hyder Ali in 1768 and 1769, and of other mea&s;ures which he cen&s;ures (whether right or wrong it &s;ignifies nothing) and into which he &s;ays he had been led by the company's &s;ervants; he proceeds in this

manner&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"If all the&s;e things were again&s;t the real intere&s;ts of the company, they are ten thou&s;and times more again&s;t mine, and again&s;t the pro&s;perity of my country, and the happine&s;s of my people; for your intere&s;ts and mine are the &s;ame. <HI>What were they owing to then? to the private views of a few individuals, who have enriched them&s;elves at the expence of your influence, and of my country; for your &s;ervants HAVE NO TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY; neither do you pay them high wages; yet in a few years they return to England, with many lacks of pogodas. How can you or I account for &s;uch immen&s;e fortunes, acquired in &s;o &s;hort a time, without any vi&s;ible means of getting them?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>When he a&s;ked this que&s;tion, which involves its an&s;wer, it is extraordinary that curio&s;ity did not prompt the chancellor of the exchequer to that en|quiry which might come in vain recommended to him by his own act of parliament. Does not the nabob of Arcot tell us in &s;o many words, that there was no fair way of making the enormous &s;ums &s;ent by the company's &s;ervants to England? And do you imagine that there was or could be more hone&s;ty and good faith in the demands, for what remained behind in India? Of what nature were the tran&s;actions with him&s;elf? If you follow the train of his information you mu&s;t &s;ee, that if the&s;e great &s;ums were at all lent, it was not property, but &s;poil that was lent; if not lent, the tran&s;action was not a contract, but a fraud. Either way, if light enough could not be furni&s;hed to au|thori&s;e a full condemnation of the&s;e demands, they ought to have been left to the parties who be&s;t knew and under&s;tood each others proceedings. It was not nece&s;&s;ary that the authority of government &s;hould interpo&s;e in favour of claims, who&s;e very foundation was a defiance of that authority, and who&s;e object and end was its entire &s;ubver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that this letter was written by the nabob of Arcot in a moody humour, under the in|fluence
<PB N="124" REF="264">
of &s;ome chagrin. Certainly it was; but it is in &s;uch humours that truth comes out. And when he tells you from his own knowledge, what every one mu&s;t pre&s;ume, from the extreme probability of the thing, whether he told it or not, one &s;uch te&s;timony is worth a thou&s;and that contradict that probability, when the parties have a better under&s;tanding with each other, and when they have a point to carry, that may unite them in a common deceit.</P>
<P>If this body of private claims of debt, real or devi&s;ed, were a que&s;tion, as it is fal&s;ely pretended, between the nabob of Arcot as debtor, and Paul Benfield and his a&s;&s;ociates as creditors, I am &s;ure I &s;hould give my&s;elf but little trouble about it. If the hoards of oppre&s;&s;ion were the fund for &s;atisfying the claims of bribery and peculation, who would wi&s;h to interfere between &s;uch litigants? If the demands were confined to what might be drawn from the trea&s;ures which the company's records uniformly a&s;&s;ert that the nabob is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; or if he had mines of gold or &s;ilver, or diamonds (as we know that he has none) the&s;e gentlemen might break open his hoards, or dig in his mines, without any di&s;turbance from me. But the gentlemen on the other &s;ide of the hou&s;e know as well as I do, and they dare not contradict me, that the nabob of Arcot and his creditors are not adver|&s;aries, but collu&s;ive parties, and that the whole tran&s;|action is under a fal&s;e colour, and fal&s;e names. The litigation is not, nor ever has been, between their rapacity and his hoarded riches. No; it is between him and them combining and confederating on one &s;ide, and the public revenues, and the mi&s;erable inhabitants of a ruined country, on the other. The&s;e are the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l plaintiffs and the real defendants in the &s;uit. Refu&s;ing a &s;hilling from his hoards for the &s;ati&s;|faction of any demand, the nabob of Arcot is always ready, nay, he earne&s;tly, and with eagerne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, contends for delivering up to the&s;e pretended creditors his territory and his &s;ubjects. It is therefore

not from trea&s;uries and mines, but from the food of your unpaid armies, from the blood withheld from the veins, and whipt out of the backs of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men, that we are to pamper extor|tion, u&s;ury, and peculation, under the fal&s;e names of debtors and creditors of &s;tate.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>INDIA COMPANY (POLICY OF.)</HEAD>

In that ca&s;e troops are bountifully &s;ent to him to maintain his authority. That he &s;hould have no want of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, a civil gentleman, called a re&s;ident, is kept at his court, who, under pretence of providing duly for the pay of the&s;e troops, gets a&s;&s;ignments on the revenue into his hands. Under his provident ma|nagement, debts &s;oon accumulate; new a&s;&s;ignments are made for the&s;e debts; until, &s;tep by &s;tep, the whole revenue, and with it the whole power of the country, is delivered into his hands. The military do not behold without a virtuous emulation the mo|derate gains of the civil department. They feel that, in a country driven to habitual rebellion by the civil government, the military is nece&s;&s;ary; and they will not permit their &s;ervices to go unrewarded. Tracts of country are delivered over to their di&s;cretion. Then it is found proper to convert their commanding officers into farmers of revenue. Thus, between the well paid civil, and well rewarded military e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, the &s;ituation of the natives may be ea&s;ily con|jectured. The authority of the regular and lawful government is every where and in every point ex|tingui&s;hed.

<HEAD>INDIA. Fate of the Natives of India.</HEAD>
<P>WORSE, far wor&s;e, has been the fate of the poor creatures, the natives of India, whom the hypocri&s;y of the company has betrayed into complaint of op|pre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;covery of peculation. The fir&s;t woman in Bengal, the ranni of Raje&s;hahi, the ranni of Burdwan, the ranni of Amboa, by their weak and thoughtle&s;s tru&s;t in the company's honour and protection, are utterly ruined: the fir&s;t of the&s;e wo|men, a per&s;on of princely rank, and once of cor|re&s;pondent fortune, who paid above two hundred thou&s;and a year quit-rent to the &s;tate, is, according to very credible information, &s;o completely beggared as to &s;tand in need of the relief of alms. Mahomed Reza Kh&acirc;n, the &s;econd Mu&s;&s;ulman in Bengal, for having been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ill-omened honour of the countenance and protection of the court of directors, was, without the pretence of any enquiry what&s;oever into his conduct, &s;tripped of all his em|ployments, and reduced to the lowe&s;t condition.

<HEAD>INDIA. Briti&s;h Dominions in India de&s;cribed.</HEAD>
<P>IN the northern parts it is a &s;olid ma&s;s of land, about eight hundred miles in length, and four or five hundred broad. As you go &s;outhward, it becomes narrower for a &s;pace. It afterwards dilates; but narrower or broader, you po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole ea&s;tern and north-ea&s;tern coa&s;t of that va&s;t country, quite from the borders of Pegu.&mdash;Bengal, Bahar, and Ori&s;&s;a, with Benares (now unfortunately in our im|mediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) mea&s;ure 161,978 &s;quare Engli&s;h miles; a territory con&s;iderably larger than the whole kingdom of France. Oude, with its dependant pro|vinces, is 53,286 &s;quare miles, not a great deal le&s;s than England. The Carnatic, with Tanjour and the Circars, is 65,948 &s;quare miles, very con&s;iderably larger than England; and the whole of the company's dominions, comprehending Bombay and Sal&s;ette, amounts to 281,412 &s;quare miles; which forms a territory larger than any European dominion, Ru&s;&s;ia and Turkey excepted. Through all that va&s;t extent of country there is not a man who eats a mouthful of rice but by permi&s;&s;ion of the Ea&s;t India company.&mdash;So far with regard to the extent. The population of this great empire is not ea&s;y to be calculated. When the countries, of which it is compo&s;ed, came into our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they were all eminently peopled, and eminently productive; though at that time con|&s;iderably declined from their antient pro&s;perity. But &s;ince they are come into our hands!&mdash;! How|ever, if we take the period of our e&s;timate immedi|ately
<PB N="128" REF="268">
before the utter de&s;olation of the Carnatic, and if we allow for the havoc which our government had even then made in the&s;e regions, we cannot, in my opinion, rate the population at much le&s;s than thirty millions of &s;ouls; more than four times the number of per&s;ons in the i&s;land of Great Britain.</P>
<P>My next enquiry to that of the number, is the quality and de&s;cription of the inhabitants. This mul|titude of men does not con&s;i&s;t of an abject and bar|barous populace; much le&s;s of gangs of &s;avages, like the Guaranies and Chiquitos, who wander on the wa&s;te borders of the river of Amazons, or the Plate; but a people for ages civilized and cultivated; culti|vated by all the arts of poli&s;hed life, whil&s;t we were yet in the woods. There, have been (and &s;till the &s;keletons remain) princes once of great dignity, au|thority, and opulence. There, are to be found the chiefs of tribes and nations. There, is to be found an antient and venerable prie&s;thood, the depo&s;itory of their laws, learning, and hi&s;tory, the guides of the people whil&s;t living, and their con&s;olation in death; a nobility of great antiquity and renown; a multitude of cities, not exceeded in population and trade by tho&s;e of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in Europe; merchants and bankers, individual hou&s;es of whom have once vied in capital with the Bank of England; who&s;e credit had often &s;upported a tottering &s;tate, and pre|&s;erved their governments in the mid&s;t of war and de|&s;olation; millions of ingenious manufacturers and mechanics; millions of the mo&s;t diligent, and not the lea&s;t intelligent, tillers of the earth. Here are to be found almo&s;t all the religions profe&s;&s;ed by men, the Bramincal, the Mu&s;&s;ulmen, the Ea&s;tern and the We&s;tern Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If I were to take the whole aggregate of our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions there, I &s;hould compare it, as the neare&s;t parallel I can find, with the empire of Germany. Our immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions I &s;hould compare with the
<PB N="129" REF="269">
Au&s;trian dominions, and they would not &s;uffer in the compari&s;on. The nabob of Oude might &s;tand for the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; the nabob of Arcot I would compare, as &s;uperior in territory, and equal in re|venue, to the elector of Saxony. Cheyt Sing, the rajah of Benares, might well rank with the prince of He&s;&s;e, at lea&s;t; and the rajah of Tanjore (though hardly equal in extent of dominion, &s;uperior in re|venue) to the elector of Bavaria. The Polygars and the northern Zemindars, and other great chiefs, might well cla&s;s with the re&s;t of the princes, dukes, counts, marqui&s;&s;es, and bi&s;hops in the empire; all of whom I mention to honour, and &s;urely without di&s;|paragement to any or all of tho&s;e mo&s;t re&s;pectable princes and grandees.</P>
<P>All this va&s;t ma&s;s, compo&s;ed of &s;o many orders and cla&s;&s;es of men, is again infinitely diver&s;ified by manners, by religion, by hereditary employment, through all their po&s;&s;ible combinations. This ren|ders the handling of India a matter in an high degree critical and delicate. But oh! it has been handled rudely indeed. Even &s;ome of the reformers &s;eem to have forgot that they had any thing to do but to re|gulate the tenants of a manor, or the &s;hopkeepers of the next county town.</P>
<P>It is an empire of this extent, of this complicated nature, of this dignity and importance, that I have compared to Germany, and the German government; not for an exact re&s;emblance, but as a &s;ort of a middle term, by which India might be approximated to our under&s;tandings, and if po&s;&s;ible to our feelings; in order to awaken &s;omething of &s;ympathy for the unfortunate natives, of which I am afraid we are not perfectly &s;u&s;ceptible, whil&s;t we look at this very remote object through a fal&s;e and cloudy medium.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>JACOBINS. Character of the Briti&s;h Jacobins.</HEAD>
<P>IT cannot be concealed. We are a divided people. But in divi&s;ions, where a part is to be taken, we are to make a mu&s;ter of our &s;trength. I have often en|deavoured to cla&s;s tho&s;e who, in any political view, are to be called the people. Without doing &s;ome|thing of this &s;ort we mu&s;t proceed ab&s;urdly. We &s;hould pre&s;ume as ab&s;urdly, if we pretended to very great accuracy in our e&s;timate. But I think, in the calculation I have made, the error cannot be very material. In England and Scotland, I compute that tho&s;e of adult age, not declining in life, of tolerable lei&s;ure for &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and of &s;ome means of information, more or le&s;s, and who are above menial dependence, (or what virtually is &s;uch) may amount
<PB N="132" REF="272">
to about four hundred thou&s;and. In this number I include the women that take a concern in tho&s;e tran&s;actions, who cannot exceed twenty thou&s;and. There is &s;uch a thing as a natural repre&s;entative of the people. This body is that repre&s;entative; and on this body, more than on the legal con&s;tituent, the artificial repre&s;entative depends. This is the Briti&s;h public, and it is a public very numerous. The re&s;t, when feeble, are the objects of protection; when &s;trong, the means of force. They who affect to con|&s;ider that part of us in any other light, in&s;ult while they cajole us; they do not want us for coun&s;ellors in deliberation, but to li&s;t us as &s;oldiers for battle.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e four hundred thou&s;and political citizens, I look upon one fifth, or about eighty thou&s;and, to be pure Jacobins, utterly incapable of amendment; objects of eternal vigilance; and when they break out, of legal con&s;traint. On the&s;e, no rea&s;on, no argument, no example, no venerable authority, can have the &s;lighte&s;t influence. They de&s;ire a change, and they will have it if they can. If they cannot have it by Engli&s;h cabal, they will make no &s;ort of &s;cruple of having it by the cabal of France, into which already they are virtually incorporated.</P>
<P>This minority is great and formidable. I do not know whether if I aimed at the total overthrow of a kingdom, I &s;hould wi&s;h to be encumbered with a larger body of partizans. The&s;e, by their &s;pirit of intrigue, and by their re&s;tle&s;s agitating activity, are of a force far &s;uperior to their numbers; and if times grew the lea&s;t critical, have the means of de|bauching or intimidating many of tho&s;e who are now &s;ound, as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more pa&s;&s;ive part of the nation. This mino|rity is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace, or for war, or for any object they are led ve|hemently to de&s;ire. By pa&s;&s;ing from place to place with a velocity incredible, and diver&s;ifying their character and de&s;cription, they are capable of mi|micking
<PB N="133" REF="273">
the general voice. We mu&s;t not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noi&s;e of the acclamation.</P>
<P>The majority, the other four-fifths, is perfectly &s;ound, and of the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;po&s;itions to religion, to government, to the true and undivided intere&s;t of their country. Such men are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to peace. They who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all they wi&s;h, are languid and improvident. With this fault, (and I admit its exi&s;tence in all its extent) they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of every thing for which peace is dear to them. How|ever, the de&s;ire of peace is e&s;&s;entially the weak &s;ide of all &s;uch men. All men that are ruined, are ruined on the &s;ide of their natural propen&s;ities. There they are unguarded. They do not &s;u&s;pect that their de|&s;truction is attempted through their virtues. This their enemies are perfectly aware of, and accordingly they, the mo&s;t turbulent of mankind, who never made a &s;cruple to &s;hake the tranquillity of their country to its centre, rai&s;e a continual cry for peace with France. Peace with regicides, and war with the re&s;t of the world, is their true motto. From the beginning, and even whil&s;t the French gave the blows, and we hardly oppo&s;ed the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> to their efforts, from that day to this hour, like importunate Guinea-fowls crying one note day and night, they have called Peace, peace!!&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL></P>

<P>Now let us deal a little fairly. We mu&s;t admit, that Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;ent was one of the quarters from which danger was apprehended at the revolution, and again&s;t which a part of the coronation oath was pe|culiarly directed. By this unqualified repeal, you certainly did not mean to deny that it was the duty of the crown to pre&s;erve the church again&s;t Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters; or taking this to be the true &s;en&s;e of the two revolution acts of king William, and of the pre|vious

and &s;ub&s;equent union acts of queen Anne, you did not declare by this mo&s;t unqualified repeal, by which you broke down all the barriers, not invented, indeed, but carefully pre&s;erved at the revolution; you did not then and by that proceeding declare, that you had advi&s;ed the king to perjury towards God, and per&s;idy towards the church. No! far, very far from it! you never would have done it, if you did not think it could be done with perfect repo&s;e to the royal con&s;cience, and perfect &s;afety to the national e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion. You did this upon a full con&s;idera|tion of the circum&s;tances of your country. Now, if circum&s;tances required it, why &s;hould it be contrary to the king's oath, his parliament judging on tho&s;e circum&s;tances, to re&s;tore to his Catholic people, in &s;uch mea&s;ure, and with &s;uch modifications as the public wi&s;dom &s;hall think proper to add, <HI>&s;ome part</HI> in the&s;e franchi&s;es which they formerly had held without any limitation at all, and which, upon no &s;ort of ur|gent rea&s;on at the time, they were deprived of? If &s;uch means can with any probability be &s;hown, from cir|cum&s;tances, rather to add &s;trength to our mixed eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular con&s;titution than to weaken it; &s;urely they are means infinitely to be preferred to penalties, incapacities, and pro&s;criptions continued from generation to generation.

The &s;ecular clergy in the former, by being married, living under little re&s;traint, and hav|ing no particular education &s;uited to their function, are univer&s;ally fallen into &s;uch contempt, that they are never permitted to a&s;pire to the dignities of their own church. It is not held re&s;pectful to call them <HI>papas,</HI> their true and antient appellation, but tho&s;e who wi&s;h to addre&s;s them with civility, always call them <HI>hieromonachi.</HI> In con&s;equence of this di&s;re|&s;pect, which I venture to &s;ay, in &s;uch a church, mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a &s;ecular life, a very great
<PB N="146" REF="286">
degeneracy from reputable chri&s;tian manners has taken place throughout almo&s;t the whole of that great member of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>It was &s;o with the Latin church, before the re|&s;traint on marriage. Even that re&s;traint gave ri&s;e to the greate&s;t di&s;orders before the council of Trent, which together with the emulation rai&s;ed, and the good examples given by the reformed churches, wherever they were in view of each other, has brought on that happy amendment, which we &s;ee in the Latin communion, both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The council of Trent has wi&s;ely introduced the di&s;cipline of &s;eminaries, by which prie&s;ts are not tru&s;ted for a clerical in&s;titution, even to the &s;evere di&s;cipline of their colleges; but after they pa&s;s through them, are frequently, if not for the greater part, obliged to pa&s;s through peculiar methods, having their particular ritual function in view. It is in a great mea&s;ure to this, and to &s;imilar methods u&s;ed in foreign education, that the Roman Catholic clergy of Ireland, mi&s;erably provided for, living among low and ill-regulated people, without any di&s;cipline of &s;ufficient force to &s;ecure good manners, have been prevented from becoming an intolerable nui&s;ance to the country, in&s;tead of being, as I con|ceive they generally are, a very great &s;ervice to it.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Letter on the penal Laws again&s;t Iri&s;h Catholics.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>IRELAND. Genius and Policy of the Engli&s;h Government in Ire|land; Revolution, &amp;c. (See IRISH CATHOLICS.)</HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT po&s;&s;ibly confound in my mind all the things which were done at the revolution, with the <HI>principles</HI> of the revolution. As in mo&s;t great changes, many things were done from the nece&s;&s;ities of the time, well or ill under&s;tood from pa&s;&s;ion or
<PB N="147" REF="287">
from vengeance, which were not only not perfectly agreeable to its principles, but in the mo&s;t direct con|tradiction to them. I &s;hall not think that the <HI>depri|vation of &s;ome millions of people of all the rights of citizens, and all intere&s;t in the con&s;titution, in and to which they were born,</HI> was a thing conformable to the <HI>declared principles</HI> of the revolution. This, I am &s;ure, is true relatively to England (where the opera|tion of the&s;e <HI>anti-principles</HI> comparatively were of little extent) and &s;ome of our late laws, in repealing acts made immediately after the revolution, admit that &s;ome things then done were not done in the true &s;pirit of the revolution. But the revolution operated differently in England and Irelend, in many, and the&s;e e&s;&s;ential particulars. Suppo&s;ing the principles to have been altogether the &s;ame in both kingdoms, by the application of tho&s;e principles to very dif|ferent objects, the whole &s;pirit of the &s;y&s;tem was changed, not to &s;ay rever&s;ed. In England it was the &s;truggle of the <HI>great body</HI> of the people for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their liberties, again&s;t the efforts of a very <HI>&s;mall faction,</HI> who would have oppre&s;&s;ed them. In Ireland it was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the power of the &s;maller number, at the expence of the civil li|berties and properties of the far greater part; and at the expence of the political liberties of the whole. It was, to &s;ay the truth, not a revolution, but a con|que&s;t; which is not to &s;ay a great deal in its favour. To in&s;i&s;t on every thing done in Ireland at the re|volution, would be to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;evere and jealous policy of a conqueror, in the crude &s;ettlement of his new acqui&s;ition, as a <HI>permanent</HI> rule for its future government. This, no power, in no country that ever I heard of, has done or profe&s;&s;ed to do&mdash;ex|cept in Ireland; where it is done, and po&s;&s;ibly by &s;ome people will be profe&s;&s;ed. Time has, by de|grees, in all other places and periods, blended and coalited the conquered with the conquerors. So,

after &s;ome time, and after one of the mo&s;t rigid con|que&s;ts that we read of in hi&s;tory, the Normans &s;of|tened into the Engli&s;h. I wi&s;h you to turn your re|collection to the fine &s;peech of Cerealis to the Gauls, made to di&s;&s;uade them from revolt. Speaking of the Romans,&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Nos</HI> quamvis toties lace&s;&s;iti, jure victo|riae id &s;olum vobis addidimus, quo pacem tuere|mur; nam neque quies gentium &s;ine armis; neque arma &s;ine &s;tipendiis; neque &s;tipendia &s;ine tributis, haberi queant. <HI>Coetera in communi &s;ita &s;unt</HI>: ip&s;i plerumque no&s;tris exercitibus <HI>proe&s;idetis:</HI> ip&s;i has alia&s;que provincias <HI>regitis: nil &s;eperatum clau&s;umve</HI>&mdash;Proinde pacem et urbem, quam <HI>victores victique eodem jure obtinemus,</HI> amate, colite."</Q>
You will con&s;ider, whether the arguments u&s;ed by that Roman to the&s;e Gauls, would apply to the ca&s;e in Ireland; and whether you could u&s;e &s;o plau&s;ible a preamble to any &s;evere warning you might think it proper to hold out to tho&s;e who &s;hould re&s;ort to &s;edition in&s;tead of &s;upplication, to obtain any object that they may pur|&s;ue with the governing power.</P>
<P>For a much longer period than that which had &s;uf|ficed to blend the Romans with the nation to which of all others they were the mo&s;t adver&s;e, the Pro|te&s;tants &s;ettled in Ireland, con&s;idered them&s;elves in no other light than that of a &s;ort of colonial garri|&s;on, to keep the natives in &s;ubjection to the other &s;tate of Great Britain. The whole &s;pirit of the re|volution in Ireland, was that of not the milde&s;t con|queror. In truth, the &s;pirit of tho&s;e proceedings did not commence at that aera, nor was religion, of any kind, their primary object. What was done, was not in the &s;pirit of a conte&s;t between two religious factions; but between two adver&s;e nations. The &s;tatutes of Kilkenny &s;hew, that the &s;pirit of the po|pery laws, and &s;ome even of their actual provi&s;ions, as applied between Engli&s;hry and Iri&s;hry, had ex|i&s;ted in that hara&s;&s;ed country before the words Pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="149" REF="289">
and Papi&s;t were heard of in the world. If we read baron Finglas, Spen&s;er, and Sir John Davis, we cannot mi&s;s the true genius and policy of the Engli&s;h government there before the revolution, as well as during the whole reign of queen Elizabeth. Sir John Davis boa&s;ts of the benefits received by the natives, by extending to them the Engli&s;h law, and turning the whole kingdom into &s;hire ground. But the appearance of things alone was changed. The original &s;cheme was never deviated from for a &s;ingle hour. Unheard-of confi&s;cations were made in the northern parts, upon grounds of plots and con&s;pira|cies, never proved upon their &s;uppo&s;ed authors. The war of chicane &s;ucceeded to the war of arms and of ho&s;tile &s;tatutes; and a regular &s;eries of operations were carried on, particularly from Chiche&s;ter's time, in the ordinary courts of ju&s;tice, and by &s;pecial com|mi&s;&s;ions and inqui&s;itions; fir&s;t, under pretence of te|nures, and then of titles in the crown, for the pur|po&s;e of the total extirpation of the intere&s;t of the na|tives in their own &s;oil&mdash;until this &s;pecies of &s;ubtle ravage, being carried to the la&s;t exce&s;s of oppre&s;&s;ion and in&s;olence under Lord Strafford, it kindled the flames of that rebellion which broke out in 1641. By the i&s;&s;ue of that war, by the turn which the Earl of Clarendon gave to things at the re&s;toration, and by the total reduction of the kingdom of Ireland in 1691, the ruin of the native Iri&s;h, and in a great mea&s;ure too, of the fir&s;t races of the Engli&s;h, was completely accompli&s;hed. The new Engli&s;h intere&s;t was &s;ettled with as &s;olid a &s;tability as any thing in human affairs can look for. All the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppre&s;&s;ion, which were made after the la&s;t event, were manife&s;tly the effects of national hatred and &s;corn towards a conquered people; whom the victors delighted to trample upon, and were not at all afraid to provoke. They were not the effect of their fears but of their &s;ecurity.
<PB N="150" REF="290">
They who carried on this &s;y&s;tem, looked to the irre|&s;i&s;tible force of Great Britain for their &s;upport in their acts of power. They were quite certain, that no complaints of the natives would be heard on this &s;ide of the water, with any other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of contempt and indignation. Their cries &s;erv|ed only to augment their torture. Machines, which could an&s;wer their purpo&s;es &s;o well, mu&s;t be of an excellent contrivance. Indeed, in England, the dou|ble name of the complainants, Iri&s;h and Papi&s;ts (it would be hard to &s;ay, &s;ingly, which &s;ingly was the mo&s;t odious) &s;hut up the hearts of every one again&s;t them. Whil&s;t that temper prevailed, and it prevailed in all its force to a time within our memory, every mea&s;ure was plea&s;ing and popular, ju&s;t in proportion as it tended to hara&s;s and ruin a &s;et of people, who were looked upon as enemies to God and man; and, indeed, as a race of bigotted &s;avages, who were a di&s;grace to human nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, as the Engli&s;h in Ireland began to be domiciliated, they began al&s;o to recollect that they had a country. The <HI>Engli&s;h intere&s;t,</HI> at fir&s;t by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aint and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible degrees, but at length openly and avowedly, became an <HI>independent Iri&s;h intere&s;t;</HI> full as independent as it could ever have been, if it had continued in the per&s;ons of the native Iri&s;h; and it was maintained with more &s;kill, and more con&s;i&s;|tency than probably it would have been in theirs. With their views, the <HI>Anglo-Iri&s;h</HI> changed their maxims&mdash;it was nece&s;&s;ary to demon&s;trate to the whole people that there was &s;omething at lea&s;t, of a com|mon intere&s;t, combined with the independency, which was to become the object of common exertions. The mildne&s;s of government produced the fir&s;t relaxation towards the Iri&s;h; the nece&s;&s;ities, and, in part too, the temper that predominated at this great change, produced the &s;econd and the mo&s;t important of the&s;e relaxations. Engli&s;h government, and Iri&s;h legi&s;la|ture,
<PB N="151" REF="291">
felt jointly the propriety of this mea&s;ure. The Iri&s;h parliament and nation became independent.</P>
<P>The true revolution to you, that which mo&s;t in|trin&s;ically and &s;ub&s;tantially re&s;embled the Engli&s;h re|volution of 1688, was the Iri&s;h revolution of 1782. The Iri&s;h parliament of 1782 bore little re&s;emblance to that which &s;at in that kingdom, after the period of the fir&s;t of the&s;e revolutions. It bore a much nearer re&s;emblance to that which &s;at under king James. The change of the parliament in 1782 from the character of the parliament which, as a token of its indignation, had burned all the journals indi&s;criminately of the former parliament in the council chamber, was very vi&s;ible. The addre&s;s of king William's parliament, the parliament which a&s;&s;embled after the revolution, among&s;t other cau&s;es of complaint (many of them &s;ufficiently ju&s;t) complains of the repeal by their pre|dece&s;&s;ors of Poyning's law; no ab&s;olute idol with the parliament of 1782.</P>
<P>Great Britain finding the Anglo-Iri&s;h highly ani|mated with a &s;pirit, which had, indeed, &s;hewn it&s;elf before, though with little energy, and many inter|ruptions, and therefore &s;uffered a multitude of uni|form precedents to be e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t it, acted, in my opinion, with the greate&s;t temperance and wi&s;dom. She &s;aw that the di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>leading part</HI> of the nation would not permit them to act any longer the part of a <HI>garri&s;on.</HI> She &s;aw that true policy did not require that they ever &s;hould have appeared in that character; or if it had done &s;o formerly, the rea&s;ons had now cea&s;ed to operate. She &s;aw that the Iri&s;h of her race, were re&s;olved to build their con&s;titution and their polites upon another bottom. With tho&s;e things under her view, &s;he in&s;tantly complied with the whole of your demands, without any re&s;ervation what&s;oever. She &s;urrendered that boundle&s;s &s;upe|riority, for the pre&s;ervation of which, and the ac|qui&s;ition, &s;he had &s;upported the Engli&s;h colonies in
<PB N="152" REF="292">
Ireland for &s;o long a time, and at &s;o va&s;t an expence (according to the &s;tandard of tho&s;e ages) of her blood and trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When we bring before us the matter which hi&s;tory affords for our &s;election, it is not improper to exa|mine the &s;pirit of the &s;everal precedents, which are candidates for our choice. Might it not be as well for your &s;tate&s;men, on the other &s;ide of the water, to take an example from this latter, and &s;urely more conciliatory revolution, as a pattern for your conduct towards your own fellow-citizens, than from that of 1688, when a paramount &s;overeignty over both you and them, was more loftily claimed, and more &s;ternly exerted, than at any former, or at any &s;ub&s;equent period? Great Britain in 1782, ro&s;e above the vulgar ideas of policy, the ordinary jealou&s;ies of &s;tate, and all the &s;entiments of national pride and national am|bition. If &s;he had been more di&s;po&s;ed than, I thank God for it, &s;he was, to li&s;ten to the &s;ugge&s;tions of pa&s;&s;ion, than to the dictates of prudence; &s;he might have urged the principles, the maxims, the policy, the practice of the revolution, again&s;t the demands of the leading de&s;cription in Ireland, with full as much plau&s;ibility, and full as good a grace, as any among&s;t them can po&s;&s;ibly do, again&s;t the &s;upplications of &s;o va&s;t and exten&s;ive a de&s;cription of their own people.</P>
<P>A good deal too, if the &s;pirit of domination and exclu&s;ion had prevailed in England, might have been excepted again&s;t &s;ome of the means then employed in Ireland, whil&s;t her claims were in agitation. They were, at lea&s;t, as much out of the ordinary cour&s;e, as tho&s;e which are now objected again&s;t admitting your people to any of the benefits of an Engli&s;h con|&s;titution. Mo&s;t certainly, neither with you, nor here, was any one ignorant of what was at that time &s;aid, written, and done. But on all &s;ides we &s;eparated the means from the end; and we &s;eparated the cau&s;e of the moderate and rational, from the ill-intentioned
<PB N="153" REF="293">
and &s;editious; which on &s;uch occa&s;ions are &s;o fre|quently apt to march together. At that time, on your part, you were not afraid to review what was done at the revolution of 1688, and what had been continued during the &s;ub&s;equent flouri&s;hing period of the Briti&s;h empire. The change then made was a great and fundamental alteration. In the execution, it was an opero&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s on both &s;ides of the water. It required the repeal of &s;everal laws; the modifi|cation of many, and a new cour&s;e to be given to an infinite number of legi&s;lative, judicial, and official practices and u&s;ages in both kingdoms. This did not frighten any of us. You are now a&s;ked to give, in &s;ome moderate mea&s;ure, to your fellow-citizens, what Great Britain gave to you, without any mea&s;ure at all. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the difficulties at the time, and the apprehen&s;ions which &s;ome very well-meaning people entertained, through the admirable temper in which this revolution (or re&s;toration in the nature of a revolution) was conducted in both king|doms, it has hitherto produced no inconvenience to either; and I tru&s;t, with the continuance of the &s;ame temper, that it never will. I think that this &s;mall incon&s;iderable change relative to an exclu&s;ive &s;tatute not made at the revolution, for re&s;toring the people to the benefits, from which the green &s;orene&s;s of a civil war had not excluded them, will be productive of no &s;ort of mi&s;chief what&s;oever. Compare what was done in 1782 with what is wi&s;hed in 1792; con|&s;ider the &s;pirit of what has been done at the &s;everal periods of reformation; and weigh maturely, whether it be exactly true that conciliatory conce&s;&s;ions are of good policy only in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions between nations; but that among de&s;criptions in the &s;ame nation, they mu&s;t always be irrational and dangerous. What have you &s;uffered in your peace, your pro&s;perity, or, in what ought ever to be dear to a nation, your glory, by the la&s;t act by which you took the property of that

<HEAD>IRELAND. The Engli&s;h Parliament early communicated to Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>IRELAND, before the Engli&s;h conque&s;t, though never governed by a de&s;potic power, had no parlia|ment. How far the Engli&s;h parliament it&s;elf was at that time modelled according to the pre&s;ent form, is di&s;puted among antiquarians. But we have all the rea&s;on in the world to be a&s;&s;ured, that a form of par|liament, &s;uch as England then enjoyed, &s;he in&s;tantly communicated to Ireland; and we are equally &s;ure that almo&s;t every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive improvement in con&s;ti|tutional liberty, as fa&s;t as it was made here, was tran&s;mitted thither. The feudal baronage, and the feudal knighthood, the roots of our primitive con|&s;titution, were early tran&s;planted into that &s;oil; and grew and flouri&s;hed there. Magna Charta, if it did not give us originally the hou&s;e of commons, gave us at lea&s;t an hou&s;e of commons of weight and con|&s;equence. But your ance&s;tors did not churli&s;hly &s;it down alone to the fea&s;t of Magna Charta. Ireland was made immediately a partaker. This benefit of Engli&s;h laws and liberties, I confe&s;s, was not at fir&s;t extended to <HI>all</HI> Ireland. Mark the con&s;equence. Engli&s;h authority and Engli&s;h liberties had exactly the &s;ame boundaries. Your &s;tandard could never be advanced an inch before your privileges. Sir John Davis &s;hews beyond a doubt, that the refu&s;al of a general communication of the&s;e rights, was the true cau&s;e why Ireland was five hundred years in &s;ubduing; and after the vain projects of a military government, attempted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it was
<PB N="155" REF="295">
&s;oon di&s;covered, that nothing could make that country Engli&s;h, in civility and allegiance, but your laws and your forms of legi&s;lature. It was not Engli&s;h arms, but the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, that conquered Ireland. From that time, Ireland has ever had a general parliament, as &s;he had before a partial parliament. You changed the people; you altered the religion; but you never touched the form or the vital &s;ub&s;tance of free government in that kingdom. You depo&s;ed kings; you re&s;tored them; you altered the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to theirs, as well as to your own crown; but you never altered their con&s;titution; the principle of which was re&s;pected by u&s;urpation; re&s;tored with the re&s;to|ration of monarchy, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, I tru&s;t, for ever, by the glorious Revolution. This has made Ireland the great and flouri&s;hing kingdom that it is; and from a di&s;grace and a burthen intolerable to this nation, has rendered a principal part of our &s;trength and ornament. This country cannot be &s;aid to have ever formally taxed her. The irregular things done in the confu&s;ion of mighty troubles, and on the hinge of great revolutions, even if all were done that is &s;aid to have been done, form no example. If they have any effect in argument, they make an exception to prove the rule. None of your own liberties could &s;tand a moment if the ca&s;ual deviations from them, at &s;uch times, were &s;uffered to be u&s;ed as proofs of their nullity.

Your Iri&s;h pen&s;ioners would &s;tarve, if they had no other fund to live on than taxes granted by Engli&s;h authority.

<HEAD>IRELAND. State of Ireland in 1780.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t conce&s;&s;ions to Ireland, by being (much again&s;t my will) mangled and &s;tripped of the parts which were nece&s;&s;ary to make out their ju&s;t corre|&s;pondence and connection in trade, were of no u&s;e. The next year a feeble attempt was made to bring the thing into better &s;hape. This attempt (countenanced by the mini&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE>) on the very fir&s;t appearance of &s;ome popular unea&s;ine&s;s, was, after a con&s;iderable progre&s;s through the hou&s;e, thrown out by <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>What was the con&s;equence? The whole kingdom of Ireland was in&s;tantly in a flame. Threatened by foreigners, and, as they thought, in&s;ulted by Eng|land, they re&s;olved at once to re&s;i&s;t the power of France, and to ca&s;t off yours. As for us, we were able neither to protect nor to re&s;train them. Forty thou&s;and men were rai&s;ed and di&s;ciplined without commi&s;&s;ion from the crown. Two illegal armies were &s;een with banners di&s;played at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame country. No executive magi&s;trate, no judicature, in Ireland, would acknowledge the legality of the army which bore the king's commi&s;&s;ion; and no law, or appearance of law, authori&s;ed the army commi&s;&s;ioned by it&s;elf. In this unexampled &s;tate of things, which the lea&s;t error, the lea&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s on the right or left, would have hurried down the precipice into an aby&s;s of blood and confu&s;ion, the people of Ireland demand a freedom of trade with arms in their hands. They interdict all commerce between the two nations. They deny all new &s;upply in the hou&s;e of commons, although in time of war. They &s;tint the tru&s;t of the old revenue, given for two years to all the king's predece&s;&s;ors, to &s;ix months. The Briti&s;h parliament, in a former &s;e&s;&s;ion frightened into a limited conce&s;&s;ion by the menaces of Ireland, frightened out of it by the menaces of England, was now frightened back again, and made an univer&s;al
<PB N="157" REF="297">
&s;urrender of all that had been thought the peculiar, re&s;erved, uncommunicable rights of England;&mdash;the exclu&s;ive commerce of America, of Africa, of the We&s;t-Indies&mdash;all the enumerations of the acts of navigation&mdash;all the manufactures,&mdash;iron, gla&s;s, even the la&s;t pledge of jealou&s;y and pride, the intere&s;t hid in the &s;ecret of our hearts, the inveterate prejudice moulded into the con&s;titution of our frame, even the &s;acred fleece it&s;elf, all went together. No re&s;erve; no exception; no debate; no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. A &s;udden light broke in upon us all. It broke in, not through well-contrived and well-di&s;po&s;ed windows, but through flaws and breaches; through the yawning cha&s;ms of our ruin. We were taught wi&s;dom by humiliation. No town in England pre&s;umed to have a prejudice; or dared to mutter a petition.

The want of a regular education, and early habits, and &s;ome lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe.

<P>Dr. Price, in this &s;ermon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 22, 23, 24.</NOTE>, condemns very pro|perly the practice of gro&s;s, adulatory addre&s;&s;es to kings. In&s;tead of this ful&s;ome &s;tyle, he propo&s;es that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be told, on occa&s;ions of con|gratulation, that

For a compliment, this new form of

The &s;lave, in the old play, tells his ma&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Haec commemoratio e&s;t quafi exprobratio.</HI>"</Q> It is not plea&s;ant as compliment, it is not whole&s;ome as in&s;truction. After all, if the king were to bring him&s;elf to echo this new kind of addre&s;s, to adopt it in terms, and even to take the appellation of Ser|vant of the People as his royal &s;tyle, how either he or we &s;hould be much mended by it, I cannot ima|gine. I have &s;een very a&s;&s;uming letters, &s;igned, Your mo&s;t obedient, humble &s;ervant. The proude&s;t domination that ever was endured on earth took a title of &s;till greater humility than that which is now propo&s;ed for &s;overeigns by the Apo&s;tle of Liberty. Kings and nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling him&s;elf <Q REND="inline">"the Servant of Servants;"</Q> and mandates for depo&s;ing &s;overeigns were &s;ealed with the &s;ignet of <Q REND="inline">"the Fi&s;herman."</Q></P>

<P>Kings, in one &s;en&s;e, are undoubtedly the &s;ervants of the people, becau&s;e their power has no other ra|tional end than that of the general advantage; but it is not true that they are, in the ordinary &s;en&s;e (by our con&s;titution at lea&s;t) any thing like &s;ervants; the e&s;&s;ence of who&s;e &s;ituation is to obey the commands of &s;ome other, and to be removeable at plea&s;ure.&mdash;But the King of Great Britain obeys no other per|&s;on; all other per&s;ons are individually, and col|lectively too, under him, and owe to him a legal obedience.

<HEAD>KING'S MEN.</HEAD>
<P>TO reconcile the minds of the people to all the&s;e movements, principles corre&s;pondent to them had been preached up with great zeal. Every one mu&s;t remember that the cabal &s;et out with the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing prudery, both moral and political. Tho&s;e who in a few months after &s;ou&s;ed over head and ears into the deepe&s;t and dirtie&s;t pits of corruption, cried out violently again&s;t the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments, which had for|merly prevailed. This marvellous abhorrence which the Court had &s;uddenly taken to all influence, was not only circulated in conver&s;ation through the king|dom, but pompou&s;ly announced to the public, with
<PB N="162" REF="302">
many other extraordinary things, in a pamphlet which had all the appearance of a manife&s;to preparatory to &s;ome con&s;iderable enterprize. Throughout, it was a &s;atire, though in terms managed and decent enough, on the politics of the former reign. It was indeed written with no &s;mall art and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>In this piece (Sentiments of an hone&s;t Man) ap|peared the fir&s;t dawning of the new &s;y&s;tem; there fir&s;t appeared the idea (then only in &s;peculation) of <HI>&s;eparating the court from the admini&s;tration</HI>; of carry|ing every thing from national connection to per&s;onal regards; and of forming a regular party for that pur|po&s;e, under the name of <HI>king's men.</HI></P>
<P>To recommend this &s;y&s;tem to the people, a per|&s;pective view of the Court, gorgeou&s;ly painted, and finely illuminated from within, was exhibited to the gaping multitude. Party was to be totally done away, with all its evil works. Corruption was to be ca&s;t down from Court, as At&egrave; was from Heaven. Power was thenceforward to be the cho&s;en re&s;idence of public &s;pirit; and no one was to be &s;uppo&s;ed under any &s;ini&s;ter influence, except tho&s;e who had the mis|fortune to be in di&s;grace at court, which was to &s;tand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions. A &s;cheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the vi&s;ionary republic of Plato. The whole &s;cenery was exactly di&s;po&s;ed to captivate tho&s;e good &s;ouls, who&s;e credulous morality is &s;o invaluable a trea&s;ure to crafty politicians. Indeed there was wherewithal to charm every body, except tho&s;e few who are not much plea&s;ed with profe&s;&s;ions of &s;uper|natural virtue, who know of what &s;tuff &s;uch profe&s;|&s;ions are made, for what purpo&s;es they are de&s;igned, and in what they are &s;ure con&s;tantly to end. Many innocent gentlemen, who had been talking pro&s;e all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter, began at la&s;t to open their eyes upon their own merits, and to attribute their not having been Lords of the Trea&s;ury and Lords of Trade many years before,
<PB N="163" REF="303">
merely to the prevalence of party, and to the mini|&s;terial power, which had fru&s;trated the good intentions of the Court in favour of their abilities. Now was the time to unlock the &s;ealed fountain of royal bounty, which had been infamou&s;ly monopolized and huck|&s;tered, and to let it flow at large upon the whole people. The time was come to re&s;tore royalty to its original &s;plendor. <HI>Mettre le Roy hors de page,</HI> became a &s;ort of watch-word; and it was con&s;tantly in the mouths of all the runners of the Court, that nothing could pre&s;erve the balance of the con&s;titution from being overturned by the rabble, or by a faction of the nobility, but to free the &s;overeign effectually from that mini&s;terial tyranny under which the royal dignity had been oppre&s;&s;ed in the per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty's grandfather.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the many artifices u&s;ed to re|concile the people to the great change which was made in the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the mini&s;try, and the &s;till greater which was made and avowed in its con&s;titution. As to individuals, other methods were employed with them; in order &s;o thoroughly to di&s;|unite every party, and even every family, that <HI>no concert; order, or effect, might appear in any future oppo&s;ition.</HI> And in this manner an Admini&s;tration, without connection with the people, or with one another, was fir&s;t put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of government.

<P>THERE is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of Europe were, at a remote period, elective, with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice; but whatever kings might have been here or el&s;ewhere, a thou&s;and years ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dyna&s;ties of England or France may have begun, the King of Great Britain is at this day king by a fixed rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, according to the laws of his country; and whil&s;t the legal condi|tions of the compact of &s;overeignty are performed by him (as they are performed) he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a &s;ingle vote for a king among&s;t them, either individually or collectively; though I make no doubt they would &s;oon erect them&s;elves into an elec|toral college, if things were ripe to give effect to their claim. His Maje&s;ty's heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, each in his time and order, will come to the crown with the &s;ame contempt of their choice with which his Maje&s;ty has &s;ucceeded to that he wears.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the &s;ucce&s;s of eva&s;ion in ex|plaining away the gro&s;s error of <HI>fact,</HI> which &s;uppo&s;es that his Maje&s;ty (though he holds it in concurrence with the wi&s;hes) owes his crown to the choice of his people, yet nothing can evade their full explicit de|claration, concerning the principle of a right in the people to chu&s;e, which right is directly maintained, and tenaciou&s;ly adhered to. All the oblique in&s;inu|ations concerning election bottom in this propo&s;ition, and are referable to it. Le&s;t the foundation of the king's exclu&s;ive legal title &s;hould pa&s;s for a mere rant

<P>The&s;e gentlemen of the Old Jewry, in all their rea&s;onings on the revolution of 1688, have a revolu|tion which happened in England about forty years before, and the late French revolution, &s;o much be|fore their eyes, and in their hearts, that they are con&s;tantly confounding all the three together.

<P>This declaration of right (the act of the 1&s;t of William and Mary, &s;e&s;&s;. 2. ch. 2.) is the corner-&s;tone of our con&s;titution, as reinforced, explained, im|proved, and in its fundamental principles for ever &s;ettled. It is called

You will ob&s;erve, that the&s;e rights and this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are declared in one body, and bound indi&s;&s;olubly together.</P>
<P>A few years after this period, a &s;econd opportu|nity offered for a&s;&s;erting a right of election to the crown. On the pro&s;pect of a total failure of i&s;&s;ue from King William, and from the Prince&s;s, after|wards Queen Anne, the con&s;ideration of the &s;ettle|ment of the crown, and of a further &s;ecurity for the liberties of the people, again came before the Le|gi&s;lature. Did they this &s;econd time make any pro|vi&s;ion for legalizing the crown on the &s;purious revo|lution principles of the Old Jewry? No. They fol|lowed the principles which prevailed in the Declara|tion of Right; indicating with more preci&s;ion the per&s;ons who were to inherit in the Prote&s;tant line.&mdash;This act al&s;o incorporated, by the &s;ame policy, our liberties, and an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame act. In&s;tead of a right to chu&s;e our own governors, they declared that the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> in that line (the Prote&s;tant line drawn from James the Fir&s;t) was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary <Q REND="inline">"for the peace, quiet, and &s;ecurity of the realm,"</Q> and that it was equally urgent on them
<Q REND="inline">"to maintain a <HI>certainty in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> thereof, to which the &s;ubjects may &s;afely have recour&s;e for their protection."</Q>
Both the&s;e acts, in which are heard the unerring, unambiguous oracles of revolution policy, in&s;tead of countenancing the delu&s;ive, gip&s;ey predictions of a <Q REND="inline">"right to chu&s;e our governors,"</Q> prove to a demon&s;tration how totally adver&s;e the wi&s;|dom

of the nation was from turning a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity into a rule of law.</P>
<P>Unque&s;tionably there was at the revolution, in the per&s;on of King William, a &s;mall and a temporary de|viation from the &s;trict order of a regular hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but it is again&s;t all genuine principles of juri&s;prudence to draw a principle from a law made in a &s;pecial ca&s;e, and regarding an individual per&s;on. <HI>Privilegium non tran&s;it in exemplum.</HI> If ever there was a time favourable for e&s;tabli&s;hing the principle, that a king of popular choice was the only legal king, without all doubt it was at the revolution. Its not being done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any time. There is no per&s;on &s;o completely ignorant of our hi&s;tory, as not to know that the majority in Parlia|ment of both parties were &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to any thing re&s;embling that principle, that at fir&s;t they were determined to place the vacant crown, not on the head of the Prince of Orange, but on that of his wife Mary, daughter of King James, the elde&s;t born of the i&s;&s;ue of that king, which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his. It would be to repeat a very trite &s;tory, to recall to your memory all tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which demon&s;trated that their accepting King William was not properly a <HI>choice;</HI> but to all tho&s;e who did not wi&s;h, in effect, to recall King James, or to deluge their country in blood, and again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties into the peril they had ju&s;t e&s;caped, it was an act of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t moral &s;en&s;e in which nece&s;&s;ity can be taken.</P>
<P>In the very act, in which, for a time, and in a &s;ingle ca&s;e, Parliament departed from the &s;trict order of inheritance, in favour of a prince, who, though not next, was however very near in the line of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, it is curious to ob&s;erve how Lord Somers, who drew the bill, called the Declaration of Right, has comported him&s;elf on that delicate occa&s;ion. It is curious to ob&s;erve with what addre&s;s this temporary

&s;olution of continuity is kept from the eye; whil&s;t all that could be found in this act of nece&s;&s;ity to countenance the idea of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is brought forward, and fo&s;tered, and made the mo&s;t of, by this great man, and by the Legi&s;lature who followed him. Quitting the dry, imperative &s;tyle of an act of Parliament, he makes the Lords and Com|mons fall to a pious, legi&s;lative ejaculation, and declare, that they con&s;ider it
<Q REND="inline">"as a marvellous pro|vidence, and merciful goodne&s;s of God to this nation, to pre&s;erve their &s;aid Maje&s;ties <HI>royal</HI> per|&s;ons, mo&s;t happily to reign over us <HI>on the throne of their ance&s;tors,</HI> for which, from the bottom of their hearts, they return their humble&s;t thanks and prai&s;es."</Q>
The Legi&s;lature plainly had in view the act of recognition of the fir&s;t of Queen Elizabeth, chap. 3d, and of that of James the Fir&s;t, chap. 1&s;t, both acts &s;trongly declaratory of the inheritable na|ture of the crown, and in many parts they follow, with a nearly literal preci&s;ion, the words, and even the form of thank&s;giving, which is found in the&s;e old declaratory &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>The two hou&s;es, in the act of King William, did not thank God that they had found a fair opportunity to a&s;&s;ert a right to choo&s;e their own governors, much le&s;s to make an election the <HI>only lawful</HI> title to the crown. Their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of it, as much as po&s;&s;ible, was by them con&s;idered as a providential e&s;cape. They threw a politic, well-wrought veil over every cir|cum&s;tance tending to weaken the rights, which in the meliorated order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion they meant to perpetuate; or which might furni&s;h a precedent for any future departure from what they had then &s;ettled for ever. Accordingly, that they might not relax the nerves of their monarchy, and that they might pre&s;erve a clo&s;e conformity to the practice of their ance&s;tors, as it appeared in the declaratory &s;tatutes of
<PB N="169" REF="309">

<Q REND="inline">"that in them they are mo&s;t <HI>fully,</HI> rightfully, and <HI>intirely</HI> inve&s;ted, incorporated, united, and an|nexed."</Q>
In the clau&s;e which follows, for pre|venting que&s;tions, by rea&s;on of any pretended titles to the crown, they declare (ob&s;erving al&s;o in this the traditionary language, along with the traditionary policy of the nation, and repeating as from a rubric the language of the preceding acts of Elizabeth and James) that on the pre&s;erving

<P>They knew that a doubtful title of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would but too much re&s;emble an election; and that an election would be utterly de&s;tructive of the <Q REND="inline">"unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation,"</Q> which they thought to be con&s;iderations of &s;ome moment. To provide for the&s;e objects, and there|fore to exclude for ever the Old Jewry doctrine of <Q REND="inline">"a right to choo&s;e our own governors,"</Q> they follow with a clau&s;e, containing a mo&s;t &s;olemn pledge, taken from the preceding act of Queen Elizabeth, as &s;olemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favour of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and as &s;olemn a renunciation as could be made of the principles by this &s;ociety imputed to them.
<Q REND="inline">"The lords &s;piritual and temporal, and commons, do, in the name of all the people afore&s;aid, mo&s;t humbly and faith|fully &s;ubmit <HI>them&s;elves, their heirs and po&s;terities for ever;</HI> and do faithfully promi&s;e, that they will &s;tand to, maintain, and defend their &s;aid maje&s;ties, and al&s;o the <HI>limitation of the crown,</HI> herein &s;pecified and contained, to the utmo&s;t of their powers," &amp;c.

<P><PB N="170" REF="310">So far is it from being true, that we acquired a right by the revolution to elect our kings, that if we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it before, the Engli&s;h nation did at that time mo&s;t &s;olemnly renounce and abdicate it, for them&s;elves, and for all their po&s;terity for ever. The&s;e gentlemen may value them&s;elves as much as they plea&s;e on their whig principles; but I never de&s;ire to be thought a better whig than Lord Somers; or to under&s;tand the principles of the revolution better than tho&s;e by whom it was brought about; or to read in the declaration of right any my&s;teries unknown to tho&s;e who&s;e penetrating &s;tyle has engraved in our ordinances, and in our hearts, the words and &s;pirit of that immortal law.</P>
<P>It is true that, aided with the powers derived from force and opportunity, the nation was at that time, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, free to take what cour&s;e it plea&s;ed for filling the throne; but only free to do &s;o upon the &s;ame grounds on which they might have wholly aboli&s;hed their monarchy, and every other part of their con&s;titution. However they did not think &s;uch bold changes within their commi&s;&s;ion. It is indeed difficult, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, to give limits to the mere <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> competence of the &s;upreme power, &s;uch as was exerci&s;ed by parliament at that time; but the limits of a <HI>moral</HI> competence, &s;ub|jecting, even in powers more indi&s;putably &s;overeign, occa&s;ional will to permanent rea&s;on, and to the &s;teady maxims of faith, ju&s;tice, and fixed fundamental po|licy, are perfectly intelligible, and perfectly binding upon tho&s;e who exerci&s;e any authority, under any name, or under any title, in the &s;tate. The hou&s;e of lords, for in&s;tance, is not morally competent to di&s;&s;olve the hou&s;e of commons; no, nor even to di&s;&s;olve it&s;elf, nor to abdicate, if it would, its portion in the legi&s;lature of the kingdom. Though a king may abdicate for his own per&s;on, he cannot abdicate for the monarchy. By as &s;trong, or by a &s;tronger rea&s;on, the hou&s;e of commons cannot renounce its
<PB N="171" REF="311">
&s;hare of authority. The engagement and pact of &s;ociety, which generally goes by the name of the con&s;titution, forbids &s;uch inva&s;ion and &s;uch &s;urrender. The con&s;tituent parts of a &s;tate are obliged to hold their public faith with each other, and with all tho&s;e who derive any &s;erious intere&s;t under their engage|ments, as much as the whole &s;tate is bound to keep its faith with &s;eparate communities. Otherwi&s;e competence and power would &s;oon be confounded, and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force. On this principle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown has always been what it now is, an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by law: in the old line it was a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the common law; in the new by the &s;tatute law, operat|ing on the principles of the common law, not chang|ing the &s;ub&s;tance, but regulating the mode, and de|&s;cribing the per&s;ons. Both the&s;e de&s;criptions of law are of the &s;ame force, and are derived from an equal authority, emanating from the common agreement and original compact of the &s;tate, <HI>communi &s;pon&s;ione reipublicae,</HI> and as &s;uch are equally binding on king and people too, as long as the terms are ob&s;erved, and they continue the &s;ame body politic.</P>
<P>It is far from impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile, if we do not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be entangled in the mazes of metaphy&s;ic &s;ophi&s;try, the u&s;e both of a fixed rule and an occa&s;ional deviation; the &s;acredne&s;s of an here|ditary principle of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in our government, with a power of change in its application in ca&s;es of extreme emergency. Even in that extremity (if we take the mea&s;ure of our rights by our exerci&s;e of them at the revolution) the change is to be confined to the peccant part only; to the part which produced the nece&s;&s;ary deviation; and even then it is to be effected without a decompo&s;ition of the whole civil and political ma&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of originating a new civil order out of the fir&s;t elements of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A &s;tate without the means of &s;ome change is with|out the means of its con&s;ervation. Without &s;uch
<PB N="172" REF="312">
means it might even ri&s;k the lo&s;s of that part of the con&s;titution which it wi&s;hed the mo&s;t religiou&s;ly to pre&s;erve. The two principles of con&s;ervation and correction operated &s;trongly at the two critical pe|riods of the re&s;toration and revolution, when Eng|land found it&s;elf without a king. At both tho&s;e pe|riods the nation had lo&s;t the bond of union in their antient edifice; they did not, however, di&s;&s;olve the whole fabric. On the contrary, in both ca&s;es they regenerated the deficient part of the old con&s;titution through the parts which were not impaired. They kept the&s;e old parts exactly as they were, that the part recovered might be &s;uited to them. They acted by the antient organized &s;tates in the &s;hape of their old organization, and not by the organic <HI>moleculoe</HI> of a di&s;banded people. At no time, perhaps, did the &s;overeign legi&s;lature manife&s;t a more tender regard to that fundamental principle of Briti&s;h con&s;titutional policy, than at the time of the revolution, when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The crown was carried &s;omewhat out of the line in which it had before moved; but the new line was derived from the &s;ame &s;tock. It was &s;till a line of hereditary de&s;cent; &s;till an hereditary de&s;cent in the &s;ame blood, though an hereditary de&s;cent qualified with prote&s;tanti&s;m. When the legi&s;lature altered the direction, but kept the principle, they &s;hewed that they held it inviolable.</P>
<P>On this principle, the law of inheritance had ad|mitted &s;ome amendment in the old time, and long before the aera of the revolution. Some time after the conque&s;t, great que&s;tions aro&s;e upon the legal principles of hereditary de&s;cent. It became a matter of doubt, whether the heir <HI>per capita</HI> or the heir <HI>per &s;tirpes</HI> was to &s;ucceed; but whether the heir <HI>per ca|pita</HI> gave way when the heirdom <HI>per &s;tirpes</HI> took place, or the catholic heir when the prote&s;tant was preferred, the inheritable principle &s;urvived with a &s;ort of immortality through all tran&s;migrations&mdash;
<PB N="173" REF="313">
<HI>multo&s;que per annos &s;lat fortuna dom&ucirc;s et avi numerantur avorum.</HI> This is the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, not only in its &s;ettled cour&s;e, but in all its revolutions. Whoever came in, or however he came in, whether he obtained the crown by law, or by force, the he|reditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was either continued or adopted.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the &s;ociety for revolutions &s;ee nothing in that of 1688 but the deviation from the con&s;titution; and they take the deviation from the principle for the principle. They have little regard to the obvious con&s;equences of their doctrine, though they mu&s;t &s;ee, that it leaves po&s;itive authority in very few of the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of this country. When &s;uch an unwarrantable maxim is once e&s;tabli&s;hed, that no throne is lawful but the elective, no one act of the princes who preceded their aera of fictitious election can be valid. Do the&s;e theori&s;ts mean to imitate &s;ome of their predece&s;&s;ors, who dragged the bodies of our antient &s;overeigns out of the quiet of their tombs? Do they mean to attaint and di&s;able backwards all the kings that have reigned before the revolution, and con&s;equently to &s;tain the throne of England with the blot of a continual u&s;urpation? Do they mean to invalidate, annul, or to call into que&s;tion, together with the titles of the whole line of our kings, that great body of our &s;tatute law which pa&s;&s;ed under tho&s;e whom they treat as u&s;urpers? to annul laws of ine&s;timable value to our liberties&mdash;of as great value at lea&s;t as any which have pa&s;&s;ed at or &s;ince the period of the revolution? If kings, who did not owe their crown to the choice of their people, had no title to make laws, what will become of the &s;tatute <HI>de tullagio non concedendo?</HI>&mdash;of the <HI>petition of right?</HI>&mdash;of the act of <HI>habeas corpus?</HI> Do the&s;e new doctors of the rights of men pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that King James the Second, who came to the crown as next of blood, according to the rules of a then unqualified &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was not to all intents and purpo&s;es a lawful king of England, before he had
<PB N="174" REF="314">
done any of tho&s;e acts which were ju&s;tly con&s;trued into an abdication of his crown? If he was not; much trouble in parliament might have been &s;aved at the period the&s;e gentlemen commemorate. But King James was a bad king with a good title, and not an u&s;urper. The princes who &s;ucceeded according to the act of parliament which &s;ettled the crown on the electre&s;s Sophia and on her de&s;cendants, being pro|te&s;tants, came in as much by a title of inheritance as King James did. He came in according to the law, as it &s;tood at his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown; and the princes of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick came to the in|heritance of the crown, not by election, but by the law, as it &s;tood at their &s;everal acce&s;&s;ions of prote&s;tant de&s;cent and inheritance, as I hope I have &s;hewn &s;uf|ficiently.</P>
<P>The law by which this royal family is &s;pecifically de&s;tined to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is the act of the 12th and 13th of King William. The terms of this act bind
<Q REND="inline">"us and our <HI>heirs,</HI> and our <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> to them, their <HI>heirs,</HI> and their <HI>po&s;terity,</HI>"</Q> the declaration of right had bound us to the heirs of King William and Queen Mary.
It therefore &s;ecures both an heredi|tary crown and an hereditary allegiance. On what ground, except the con&s;titutional policy of forming an e&s;tabli&s;hment to &s;ecure that kind of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which is to preclude a choice of the people for ever, could the legi&s;lature have fa&s;tidiou&s;ly rejected the fair and abundant choice which our own country pre&s;ented to them, and &s;earched in &s;trange lands for a foreign prince&s;s, from who&s;e womb the line of our future rulers were to derive their title to govern millions of men through a &s;eries of ages?</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s Sophia was named in the act of &s;et|tlement of the 12th and 13th of King William, for a <HI>&s;tock</HI> and root of <HI>inheritance</HI> to our kings, and not for her merits as a temporary admini&s;tratrix of a power, which &s;he might not, and, in fact, did not, her&s;elf ever exerci&s;e. She was adopted for one rea&s;on,
<PB N="175" REF="315">
and for one only, becau&s;e, &s;ays the act,
<Q REND="inline">"the mo&s;t excellent Prince&s;s Sophia, Electre&s;s and Dutche&s;s Dowager of Hanover, is <HI>daughter</HI> of the mo&s;t excellent Prince&s;s Elizabeth, late Queen of Bohe|mia, <HI>daughter</HI> of our late <HI>&s;overeign lord</HI> King James the Fir&s;t, of happy memory, and is hereby de|clared to be the next in <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> in the Prote&s;tant line," &amp;c.
&amp;c.;
 "and the crown &s;hall continue to the <HI>heirs</HI> of her body, being Prote&s;tants."</Q>
This limitation was made by parliament, that through the Prince&s;s Sophia an inheritable line, not only was to be continued in future, but (what they thought very material) that through her it was to be connected with the old &s;tock of inheritance in King James the Fir&s;t; in order that the monarchy might pre&s;erve an unbroken unity through all ages, and might be pre|&s;erved (with &s;afety to our religion) in the old ap|proved mode by de&s;cent, in which, if our liberties had been once endangered, they had often, through all &s;torms and &s;truggles of prerogative and privilege, been pre&s;erved. They did well. No experience hrs taught us, that in any other cour&s;e or method than that of an <HI>hereditary crown,</HI> our liberties can be regularly perpetuated and pre&s;erved &s;acred as our <HI>hereditary right.</HI> An irregular, convul&s;ive movement may be nece&s;&s;ary to throw off an irregular, convul|&s;ive di&s;ea&s;e. But the cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is the healthy habit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Was it that the legi&s;lature wanted, at the act for the limita|tion of the crown in the Hanoverian line, drawn through the female de&s;cendants of James the Fir&s;t, a due &s;en&s;e of the inconveniencies of having two or three, or po&s;&s;ibly more, foreigners in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h throne? No!&mdash;they had a due &s;en&s;e of the evils which might happen from &s;uch foreign rule, and more than a due &s;en&s;e of them. But a more deci&s;ive proof cannot be given of the full conviction of the Briti&s;h nation, that the principles of the revolution did not authorize them to elect kings at their plea&s;ure, and without any attention to the antient fundamental
<PB N="176" REF="316">
principles of our government, than their continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the old line, with all the dangers and all the inconve|niencies of its being a foreign line full before their eyes, and operating with the utmo&s;t force upon their minds.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Reflections on the Revolution in France.</HI></BIBL></P>
