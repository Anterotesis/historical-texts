<HEAD>AN INVESTIGATION OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF SCROPHULOUS DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>THE difficulties attending the treatment of Scrophula although daily occurring in the practice of almo&s;t every medical man, are &s;o great, that this di&s;ea&s;e is ju&s;tly &s;tiled the <HI>Oppro|brium Medicorum.</HI> Hence a variety of remedies have at different periods been recommended for this di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hanging of Vervain-root round the neck, the &s;urrounding the di&s;ea&s;ed parts with particular precious &s;tones, the &s;troaking the part with a dead per&s;on's hand, and many &s;imilar acts, are &s;aid by different per&s;ons to be &s;pecifics in the cure of Struma.
<BIBL>WHITE on SCROPHULA.</BIBL></NOTE> In the earlier ages, recour&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="7">was had to charms, and the royal touch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The term King's-evil, applied to Scrophula, aro&s;e from the preten&s;ions which King Edward, &s;urnamed the Confe&s;&s;or, profe&s;&s;ed to have in curing this di&s;ea&s;e by the touch, and his example was followed by all the &s;uc|ceeding Kings of both England and France. But when the&s;e mortals were convinced of the ab&s;urdity of this practice, they gave up this fooli&s;h preten&s;ion; and when the idea prevailed of its being hereditary, this appella|tion became very obnoxious, and complaints of this kind have been mo&s;t frequently called Scrophulous from the latin word <HI>Scrofula,</HI> a &s;ow-pig, from the&s;e animals being oftentimes affected with this di&s;ea&s;e. But from the above circum&s;tance of royal &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance does it really owe its <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> appellation.</NOTE> but the &s;ucce&s;s attending the&s;e modes of cure is highly incredible, and doubtle&s;s in a great mea&s;ure to be attributed to a want of &s;ufficient inve&s;tigation, which would enable us to a&s;cer|tain the difference between tho&s;e modifications of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which are really &s;crophulous, and tho&s;e, which depend upon &s;ome other con|&s;titutional affection.</P>
<P>The perplexities of our profe&s;&s;ion which are glaringly manife&s;t to every per&s;on the lea&s;t con|ver&s;ant
<PB N="9" REF="8">in it; the trivial advantages which have accrued to it, from the laborious efforts of me|dical writers; the endle&s;s folios which have been written on the di&s;tinction and cure of di&s;ea&s;es, often more with a view of acquiring popularity and gain to their authors, than of extending knowledge; to which may be added the continual embarra&s;&s;ments and acknowledged difficulties attendant on the practice of medi|cine, mu&s;t have convinced us of this melan|choly fact, that we are travelling in a wilder|ne&s;s where there exi&s;t but faint glimmerings for extrication, and where the pro&s;pect leads to de&s;pair,&mdash;were it not, that a new hope has ari&s;en, that from the happy indu&s;try of a few enlightened men, the torch of chemical phi|lo&s;ophy will finally conduct us through this labyrinth of error.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e occa&s;ions more di&s;tre&s;s to the unhappy patient, than the one in que&s;tion,
<PB N="10" REF="9">and when we reflect for a moment, how ge|neral a di&s;ea&s;e it is in this country, and how many are cut off by its ravages, who might otherwi&s;e have been ornaments in &s;ociety, it is &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing that more attention has not been be&s;towed to acquire a more cer|tain and effectual mode of treatment of a ma|lady of &s;uch a nature than that which is com|monly employed.</P>
<P>Some practitioners have attempted to &s;hew, that it is an hereditary di&s;ea&s;e, and cannot be cured without &s;ome important change produced in the con&s;titution. Mr. White in his <HI>Treati&s;e on Scrophula</HI> has refuted the arguments which have been brought forward in favour of this he|reditary di&s;po&s;ition in parents, by &s;aying, that as no form, age, or &s;ex are exempted from Struma, it cannot be con&s;idered then as an hereditary di&s;ea&s;e. For my own part, I deny the doctrine of hereditary di&s;ea&s;es altogether, for it is founded on a want of ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="11" REF="10">and has nothing to &s;upport it, but ob&s;tinacy and prejudice. A taint tran&s;mitted from pa|rents to their offspring and celebrated under the appellation of hereditary, &s;ays the learned Doctor John Brown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elementinae Medicinae.</NOTE>, is a mere tale. The &s;ons of the rich, who &s;ucceed to their father's <HI>e&s;tate,</HI> &s;ucceed al&s;o to his <HI>gout:</HI> tho&s;e who are excluded from his <HI>e&s;tate,</HI> e&s;cape that di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s they bring it on afterwards, by their own conduct. This &s;uppo&s;ition makes the noxious powers &s;uperfluous, which have been proved to be every thing re&s;pecting di&s;ea&s;e, and as it is therefore nugatory and ab&s;urd, &s;o the truth of the latter opinion mu&s;t be admit|ted<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Even the learned Doctor Cullen has fallen into &s;ome mi&s;takes re&s;pecting the doctrine of hereditary di&s;ea&s;es. He &s;ays, "Scrophula is very commonly and very gene|rally an hereditary di&s;ea&s;e, and although it &s;ometimes may happen, yet this is very rare, but in children who&s;e parents had at &s;ome period of their lives been affected with it. Whether it may not fail to appear in the chil|dren of &s;crophulous parents and di&s;cover it&s;elf afterwards in their offspring in the &s;ucceeding generation, I cannot certainly determine; but believe that this has frequently happened. It appears to me to be more commonly de|rived from fathers than from mothers: but whether this happens from there being more &s;crophulous men than women married, I am not certain."

<HEAD>SECTION II. Of SCROPHULOUS TUMOURS and ULCERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be unnece&s;&s;ary to give a long and tedious de&s;cription of &s;crophulous tumours and ulcers, &s;ince as the late Mr. Hunter ob&s;erves, the&s;e are &s;o characterized, as to be ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;hed from all others. They begin at fir&s;t generally in the neck, affecting the <HI>con|globate</HI> glands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The conglobate glands are al&s;o lymphatic. As to their &s;tructure they are &s;ometimes round, at other times oval, oblong, or flat. They vary in &s;ize, &s;ometimes as large as an acorn, and at other times as &s;mall as peas. Their &s;tructure is made up of blood-ve&s;&s;els, lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, nerves and cellular texture&mdash;the blood ve&s;&s;els are both arteries and veins. In young &s;ubjects there is an appear|ance of an intermediate body, containing a whiti&s;h liquor&mdash;they are principally &s;upplied with nerves and lympha|tics. It appears from injection that in their inward &s;ur|face they are cellular. When many grow together they form a clu&s;ter or ma&s;s. They are more numerous in the texture of the lungs or te&s;ticles, in the neck, bronchia, inte&s;tines, axilla, under the fat, above the inner con|dyle, and along the dor&s;al Vertebrae. They are placed in &s;ituations of the body, where they are ready and fit to receive pre&s;&s;ure. There is an excretion into their cells from the exhalent arteries. When the&s;e glands in the Me&s;entery are hardened or enlarged, an atrophy u&s;ually follows. Alientery is al&s;o connected with the di&s;ea&s;e of the&s;e glands.</NOTE>, feel hard, are colourle&s;s and
<PB N="18" REF="16">indolent in their progre&s;s. Such tumours in their commencement are rarely attended with pain, or certainly not much. The ab&s;orbed fluids, in their cour&s;e to the veins, in <HI>Scrophula,</HI> are arre&s;ted in the lymphatic glands, which &s;well, and after a great length of time in|flame and &s;uppurate. Doctor Darwin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ZOONOMIA, Vol. 2.</NOTE> ob|&s;erves that the&s;e indolent tumours of the lym|phatic-glands which con&s;titute Scrophula, originate from the inirritability of tho&s;e glands; which therefore &s;ooner fall into torpor after having been &s;timulated too violently by &s;ome poi&s;onous material: as the mu&s;cles of enfee|bled
<PB N="19" REF="17">per&s;ons &s;ooner become fatigued and cea&s;e to act when exerted, than tho&s;e of &s;tronger ones. On the &s;ame account the&s;e &s;crophulous glands are much larger in acquiring increa&s;e of motion, after having been &s;timulated into ac|tivity, and either remain years in a &s;tate of in|dolence, or &s;uppurate with difficulty, and &s;ometimes only partially.</P>
<P>It has been noticed by Doctor Beddoes that &s;crophulous tumours ari&s;e from a deficiency of oxygene, occa&s;ioning inirritability of the &s;y&s;tem, and when we remark the &s;allow ap|pearance of the countenance, the &s;lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and the torpor of the tumours in &s;uch patients, we &s;hall readily a&s;&s;ent to this doctrine. The tumours when they break oc|ca&s;ion ulcers, who&s;e edges are pale and flabby, and naturally di&s;inclined to heal, &s;eldom yield|ing a good di&s;charge. At fir&s;t they afford a vi&s;cid, glairy, and &s;ometimes whiti&s;h curdly
<PB N="20" REF="18">matter, which afterwards changes into a thin, and aqueous &s;anies. After continuing in this &s;tate for &s;ome length of time, the edges of the &s;ores become irregular, and &s;mooth, &s;ometimes however the&s;e are elevated, and at other times are very flat. When they are healed up quick|ly, they &s;oon break out upon &s;ome other parts of the body, where there is local debility, or in other words, dimini&s;hed action of the &s;en|&s;orial power. For this rea&s;on it appears, that vital-air, by invigorating the &s;y&s;tem, en|crea&s;ing the excitability both local and general, and by keeping up a gentle and univer&s;al &s;timu|lus, which pervades the whole frame, very frequently have effected a cure, when even all other remedies have failed.</P>
<P>At a certain age, that is between infancy and puberty, the&s;e tumours &s;ometimes di&s;ap|pear, and ulcers have healed up &s;pontaneou&s;ly, though very rarely.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19">To di&s;cu&s;s &s;crophulous tumours, and heal &s;crophulous &s;ores, a variety of remedies have been extolled, &s;uch as preparations of Mer|cury both internally and externally, &s;olutions of Cerus.

A quantity of the leaves &s;hould be procured fre&s;h, pounded in a mortar, and mixed with oatmeal, and applied as a poultice to the &s;ores. At fir&s;t it occa&s;ions much pain and redne&s;s in the part, but the pain after two or three re|petitions abates, and as to the redne&s;s that is a beneficial effect. After the application a &s;loughing comes on, and the di&s;charge which was before thin and acrid is converted into good pus. Should the di&s;charge be foetid, powdered charcoal, or fine mendip <HI>mangane&s;e</HI> reduced to an impalpable powder, &s;hould be &s;prinkled over the &s;ore previous to the poultice being applied.

<P><PB N="24" REF="22">In the treatment of Ulcers, their di&s;po&s;ition to heal (let the means of promoting this pur|po&s;e be what they may) depends upon the matter &s;ecreted by them, being fir&s;t thickened by increa&s;ing the ab&s;orption in them, and then le&s;&s;ened, till all the matter is ab&s;orbed which is brought by the arteries, in&s;tead of being depo&s;ited in the ulcers. Scrophulous ulcers are produced, chiefly in the lymphatic-glands, by weak and relaxed ve&s;&s;els, which have lo&s;t their tone, and therefore have not vital energy &s;ufficient to produce inflammation, without which, as I have before &s;aid, there can be neither <HI>&s;uppuration</HI> nor <HI>granulation.</HI> Where their edges are very high and irregular, as they &s;ometimes are, I have touched them at each dre&s;&s;ing with Bernhard's mixture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Take aretificial cinnabar, dr. 2. a&s;hes of old leather burnt, g^r. viij.

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time ago I was witne&s;s at Dr. Thornton's hou&s;e, to the cure of a remarka|ble ca&s;e of &s;crophulous tomours in a young lady. The&s;e had exi&s;ted above ten years, during which time (for her father was an opulent merchant) &s;he had been under the care of the mo&s;t eminent practitioners in this town. She had taken mercury until the teeth began to drop from her head, and bark and &s;teel in large quantities, and la&s;tly the cicuta under the late celebrated John Hunter, until blindne&s;s had come on. Having been repeat|edly at the &s;ea-&s;ide, this la&s;t eminent practi|tioner
<PB N="28" REF="26">informed her parents, that the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o fixed in her habit, that it would be in vain any longer to try medicine, and this was al&s;o the opinion of &s;everal practitioners who had been con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject. The tu|mours extended over the jaw-bones, which could not be felt, and made re&s;piration diffi|cult, and concealment impo&s;&s;ible. After a month's trial of the vital-air in conjunction with &s;trengthening remedies, and the applica|tion of &s;timulants to the inirritable glands, a vi&s;ible decrea&s;e took place, and this plan being pur&s;ued for &s;ome months, the diminution has been five inches in the neck by mea&s;urement, and nearly a total di&s;appearance of the di&s;ea&s;ed glands. The effects of oxygene-gas in this ca&s;e were the mo&s;t remarkable I ever witne&s;&s;ed. The young lady enjoyed good &s;pirits, and ex|perienced no inconvenience from the quantity of ela&s;tic fluids &s;he had inhaled.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CASE II.</HI> Of Thomas Francis of Bri&s;tol.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS Francis, aged five years, about three years ago had &s;everal Ulcers broke out about him, for the cure of which he was put under the care of &s;everal Surgeons in Wales, who ordered him to be dipped in the &s;ea. He took a variety of medicines, and e&s;|charotics were applied to the &s;ores. But his health declining very fa&s;t, his parents brough him up to Bri&s;tol, with a view of getting him admitted an in-patient to the Infirmary, in hopes of his there obtaining a &s;peedy and per|manent cure. Three weeks after his arrival in Bri&s;tol, he became an in-patient. He con|tinued only three days in, and was then di&s;|charged as incurable. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances I was urged to go and &s;ee him, and upon examination found three very large &s;cro|phulous
<PB N="30" REF="28">ulcers, with flat irregular edges, the di&s;charge very thin, acrid and foetid. One was on the <HI>pectoral bone,</HI> another over the <HI>va&s;ties internus</HI> mu&s;cle, and a third behind the ear. He had a bad cough, and di&s;turbed nights. The glands of the neck were hard and enlarged. He had a very &s;mooth &s;kin, thin upper lip, with an inela&s;tic feel, and a bluene&s;s at the ends of his fingers. From want of clothes, and plenty of food, together with the ab&s;orption of this purulent di&s;charge from the ulcers, he was reduced almo&s;t to &s;kin and bones. He was very &s;ubject to co&s;tivene&s;s, and always in great pain. I applied powder|ed charcoal to all the &s;ores, over which I put the leaves of the oxalis aceto&s;ella &s;imply brui&s;ed. A do&s;e of calomel was given him that night to evacuate the bowels. When I called upon him next moring I found he had been in great pain, occa&s;ioned by the oxalis. He had only one &s;tool during the night. The
<PB N="31" REF="29">do&s;e of the calomel was increa&s;ed from &s;even to twelve grains, which before night, procur|ed four copious &s;tools. The ulcers were this day, April 14, wa&s;hed with diluted citric-acid. The oxalis was again applied, the oxygene gas diluted with atmo&s;pherical air, five quarts of the former to &s;ix of the latter, was given him out of filken bags, not having at that time a pneumatic apparatus. A pint of wine was allowed him daily, and exerci&s;e and clean clothing &s;trictly enjoined. Forty drops Vini: opiat. (Pharm, chirurg.) were given him at bed-time.</P>
<P N="15">15. He has had a good night The di&s;|charge is increa&s;ed in quantity, is thicker and le&s;s offen&s;ive. Granulations begin to ri&s;e. His pul&s;e weak. Continued the oxalis, repeated the air, and opiate at bet-time. Ordered him the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing food, and as much port wine as the could drink. 16. The ve&s;&s;els on
<PB N="32" REF="30">the &s;urface of the &s;ores appear to have acquir'd healthy action. Fre&s;h granulations formed. The di&s;charge thicker. His pul&s;e more &s;trong. Bowels co&s;tive. Appetite &s;harper. Repeat|ed the oxalis, and increa&s;ed the quantity of oxygene-gas to eight quarts. Ordered him a purging powder con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen grains Pul. Rhei. and one &s;cruple Kali. Vitr.</P>
<P N="16">16th. The ulcers heal very fa&s;t, granulati|ons uniting every where. The powder gave him two &s;tools. He had no pain from the application of the &s;orrel. The glands behind the ears are of their former &s;ize. His &s;pirits are very good, and his general health mends fa&s;t. The oxalis was now omitted, and no|thing but lint dipped in a weak &s;olution of the vitr. coerul applied to the &s;ores. The purging powder ordered to be repeated every other night (<HI>ad tres vices.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31">From this time till the 12th of May, the &s;ores gradually healed, and by the 29th were cicatrized. He was quite recovered in every re&s;pect by the I&s;t of June, when I di&s;conti|nued my attendance, and all medicines left off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The vital-air was continued till the middle of July.</NOTE>.

<P>MISS A. T. aged 20 years, a very beautiful and accompli&s;hed young lady, had been afflicted with &s;crophula for three years. When I fir&s;t &s;aw her &s;he laboured under Ph|thi&s;is Pulmonalis.

She was &s;ubject to cold tremors every night about ten o'clock, with fever, heat, and flu&s;hing. She expec|torated every day, half a pint of put &s;treaked with blood. Her limbs were much emaciat|ed, &s;he had lo&s;t her appetite, and &s;lept very ill. The ulcers by my derection were dre&s;t every day with the oxalis aceto&s;ella, and the

<HEAD>SECTION III. Of the PULMONARY CONSUMPTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Phthi&s;is-Pulmonalis ari&s;es from a &s;crophulous affection, the &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e is found clearly to exi&s;t in the cellular &s;ub&s;tance of the Lungs, where round firm bo|dies named tubercles are formed &s;imilar to the &s;welling of the lymphatic-glands on the ex|ternal &s;urface: they are of different &s;izes from the &s;malle&s;t granule, to half an inch in dia|meter and often in clu&s;ters&mdash;They adhere pretty clo&s;ely to the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, and have no particular covering or cap&s;ule.&mdash; In proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of their &s;ize, is their firmne&s;s, and when cut into, in this &s;tate, are of a white colour with a con&s;i&s;tence nearly approaching to cartilage: in &s;ome part of them there is always a &s;mall pit or hol|low
<PB N="37" REF="35">where as they increa&s;e, the formation of the matter begins, and at length they pa&s;s into vomicae. But the formation of matter is not always determined by their &s;ize. In &s;ome it begins very early. when in &s;mall quantity. the con&s;i&s;tence of the matter is thick and cur|dy: when in greater quantity it is thinner, and more re&s;embling the matter of a common fore. From this view of the di&s;ea&s;e, which di&s;&s;ection affords, tubercles and vomicae con|&s;titute the cau&s;es of this di&s;order with its &s;everal attendant &s;ymptoms, and its difficulty of cure may be hence readily accounted for. Each of the&s;e tubercles is to be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light as that of an external lymphatic &s;welling, which in order to its termination, mu&s;t be liable to all the &s;ub&s;equent con&s;equen|ces that either attend this, or any rupture of the teguments in other &s;ituations, while an additional ob&s;tacle to the proce&s;s of healing is
<PB N="38" REF="36">here pre&s;ented from the con&s;tant motion of the lungs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">NISBIT on SCROPHULA.</NOTE></P>
<P>The accurate inve&s;tigations of Doctor Stark<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Tuberculis Pulmon.</NOTE> have thrown more light upon the &s;ubject of tubercles than all the labours of preceding phy|&s;icians. He &s;ays that tubercles whil&s;t &s;mall are always &s;olid; when large, they are &s;ome|times &s;o. They approach to the hardne&s;s of cartilage, and when cut through appear &s;mooth, &s;hining, and uniform. No ve&s;&s;els are to be &s;een in them, even when, after injecting the pulmonary artery and vein, they are examined with a micro&s;cope. They are always in the cellular &s;ub&s;tances, never in the air ve&s;&s;els, in which the extremities of the bronchial ramifi|cations terminate. They are at fir&s;t extremely &s;mall, numerous and in clu&s;ters; but never in
<PB N="39" REF="37">the lea&s;t inflamed. When they become vomi|cae, it is always in the &s;uperior and po&s;terior part of the lungs, where they form &s;trong ad|he&s;ions to the Pleura.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons liable to tubercles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The experiments of the very ingenious and learned Doctor Pa&s;cal-Jo&s;eph Ferro of Vienna throw a con&s;ide|rable light upon &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es to which he has made an exten&s;ive application of the principles of Pneumatic me|dicine. From his experiments he draws the following rational conclu&s;ions, that the in&s;piration of oxygene-gas di&s;&s;ipates the &s;pa&s;m of the ve&s;icles of the lungs; prevents the acce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;pa&s;ms, dimini&s;hes and removes the di&s;po&s;ition to inflammation in the lungs; di&s;&s;olves the ex|trava&s;ated lymph which ob&s;tructs the pulmonary ve&s;i|cles; produces good effects in the drop&s;y of the che&s;t; is a good remedy in the <HI>Tuberculous Con&s;umption,</HI> dimi|ni&s;hes hectic fever; relieves the oppre&s;&s;ion which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts after inflammation of the che&s;t; cures &s;peedily and effectually the periodical a&s;thma and hooping cough, aug|ments the &s;ecretion of urine, e&s;pecially in affections of the brea&s;t; produces no effects in Rheumati&s;m, but is <HI>a &s;overeign remedy in Scrophula.</HI></NOTE> are ge|nerally of a fair complexion, &s;oft &s;kin, and irritable fibre, and di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer by lym|phatic
<PB N="40" REF="38">tumours. Some other circum&s;tances of a local nature in addition to what has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject, may add to the fatality of the di&s;ea&s;e in this climate, and tend to bring it on where otherwi&s;e there was no predi&s;po&s;i|tion in the patient to become &s;o. One cau&s;e which may a&s;&s;i&s;t greatly, is that pa&s;&s;ion, which manife&s;ts it&s;elf among our females, but which daily grows out of fa&s;hion, of wearing tight &s;tays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another great cau&s;e, &s;ays the ingenious Dr. DARWIN, to the &s;hape of young ladies is, "from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;tays, or other tight bandages, which at the &s;ame time cau&s;e other di&s;ea&s;es by changing the form of &s;ituation of the internal parts." Some time ago I a&s;&s;i&s;ted in open|ing the body of a young woman in this city, who died of Phthi&s;is-chlorotica&mdash;She had always, I learnt, been in the habit of wearning tight &s;tays with a view of giving the body a fine &s;hape. I found the lungs full of tubercles, mo&s;tly in a &s;tate of &s;uppuration. One remarkable ap|pearance in this ca&s;e was, that the whole of the lungs was found on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Media&s;tinum:</HI> the heart with its appendages occupying the left. The liver was enlarged, the other vi&s;cera were &s;ound. The ingenious and learned Author of <HI>Medical Extracts</HI> &s;ays, "The pre&s;|&s;ure of the abdomen by &s;tays impedes the action of the &s;tomach and bowels, and the motion nece&s;&s;ary for re&s;pi|ration, and con&s;equently the ju&s;t circulation of the blood. Hence a train of dreadful di&s;orders en&s;ue. The pliancy of the body, and the natural grace of the female form, is prevented by this rigid coat of mail." The imprudent zeal of the mother for a fine &s;hape, performs another mo&s;t unkindly office to the child. She frequently be|comes either incapacitated for marriage (and what a &s;e|rious reflection that is) or dies in child-birth. The mad|ne&s;s in favour of &s;tays &s;eems, however, to be &s;omewhat abated; and it is hoped the world will in time become wi&s;e enough to know, that the human &s;hape does not &s;olely depend upon <HI>whale-bone</HI> and <HI>leather.</HI> But prejudices once deeply rooted (particularly in the female &s;ex) are only gradually obliterated.</NOTE>, by which the circulation of the blood
<PB N="41" REF="39">through the lungs is impeded, the capacity of the thorax le&s;&s;ened, and the &s;pace which in a &s;tate of health is required for the free action of the lungs, is dimini&s;hed. A narrow che&s;t, a long neck, and prominent &s;houlders, though not occurring in all ca&s;es of &s;crophula, may be con&s;idered as unfavourable marks of this di&s;|ea&s;e. Mr. Town&s;end in his Guide to Health,
<PB N="42" REF="40">Vol. 2, ob&s;erves, "that when medicines fail to effect a cure in Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis, a change of climate mu&s;t be recommended, and no cli|mate, in his opinion, can be &s;uperior to that of Valencia." Should the &s;crophulous or con|&s;umptive patient be inclined to make the trial, he will have an ea&s;y route by Paris, Lyons, Montpellier, and Barcelona, and for le&s;s than fifteen guineas he will find him&s;elf tran&s;ported into a paradi&s;e, in which nature exhibits an everla&s;ting &s;pring. (Vide Town&s;end's Travels through Spain, Vol. I. and II.) The fame in|genious author ob&s;erves, that he never met with this di&s;ea&s;e in Spain, owing as he thinks to the uniform &s;tate of the weather, and heat of the climate; but I &s;hall have occa&s;ion here|after to &s;hew, that it is a di&s;ea&s;e incident to very warm and extreme cold climates, and that contrary to the opinion of a celebrated Pro|fe&s;&s;or, is not influenced by the &s;tate of the weather.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. OPHTHALMIA TARSI.</HEAD>
<P>THE eye-lids are very commonly ano|ther &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e: it is very difficult to make a patient labouring under the Opthalmia Tar&s;i believe &s;o. A very &s;light cold frequent|ly brings on inflammation of the eye-lids, which ultimately terminates in a di&s;order of the eye, and there is no form of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o tedious to remove, or more painful in its at|tack, or in which a relap&s;e is more liable to occur than in this.</P>
<P>After the inflammation of the eye-lids com|mences, a &s;welling of the &s;obaceous glands im|mediately follows, which terminates in ulce|ration, and this ulceration is generally of a trouble&s;ome nature. A better de&s;cription of the progre&s;s of this &s;pecies of Scrophula can|not
<PB N="45" REF="43">well be given than in the words of Doctor Ni&s;bit, who ob&s;erves, "that an acrid di&s;|charge con&s;tantly takes place from it, which irritaing the eye it&s;elf renders it weak, and unable to bear much impre&s;&s;ion either of light or heat." Frequently it is of a more vi&s;cid na|ture, and glues the lids together in the night-time, leaving a gorey appearance on the lid through the day.</P>
<P>This form of the di&s;ea&s;e is not often acute, it is of a more chronic &s;pecies, and gives a di&s;|agreeable appearance to the &s;ight. The eye-lids continue always more or le&s;s inflamed, thickened, and raw, and the ulcerations are with difficulty healed up, or if they are, break out afre&s;h on any &s;udden cau&s;e of irritation. On leaving one eye the inflammation is liable in &s;uch ca&s;es to attack the other; and wher|ever one attack has taken place to a degree of violence, the patient is expo&s;ed to its recurrence
<PB N="46" REF="44">from the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;e. I have never found any difficulty in effecting a cure in the wor&s;t ca&s;es, and that even after all other remedies have failed, by directing patients to take &s;mall do&s;es of calomel at bed-time, rubbing a little of the ung. Hydrargy. nitrat. between the lids the la&s;t thing at night, and inhaling the vital|air in the day-time in do&s;es &s;uited to the age and con&s;titution of the patient. This new mode of treatment I &s;hall illu&s;trate, by an ex|ample.</P>
<P>A gentleman of my acquaintance had labour|ed under an ulceration of both eye-lids for nearly three years, and on which account he had the advice of the mo&s;t able oculi&s;ts in this city. A variety of applications at different times had been u&s;ed, and the materia-medica &s;earch|ed all over for various alteratives. He had been at the &s;ea-&s;ide for four months, and had taken the Aqua-marin. internally during the
<PB N="47" REF="45">whole of that time every other morning with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, but had derived no advan|tage. I recommended him &s;trongly to inhale oxygene-gas, which he did regularly every day for three months, in the proportion of eight quarts, to twelve of atmo&s;pherical air. As he could bear no &s;harp application to the eye-lids, &s;imple &s;permaceti ointment, melted in a &s;poon over a lighted candle, was introduced by means of a camel's-hair pencil between the Palpebrae every night. Under this plan of treatment in four months he was quite reco|vered, and has &s;ince had no relap&s;e. Change of air, plenty of exerci&s;e, with chalybeats, and the ung. hyd. nit. will &s;eldom fail of re|moving this di&s;ea&s;e, and their good effects will be augmented, if the patient inhales the <HI>vital|air.</HI> Nouri&s;hing diet, with generous port|wine, will give vigour to the &s;y&s;tem.

Whe|ther the conclu&s;ions which Mr. CROWDER draws "that an i&s;&s;ue in any part of the body, may be &s;ucce&s;sfully em|ployed in all ca&s;es of Scrophula, and may probably be &s;ufficiently powerful when it is applied in time, to prevent an attack of this di&s;ea&s;e in con&s;titutions predi&s;po&s;ed to it," future experience mu&s;t determine. I have ob&s;erved that long continued drains generally accelerate the progre&s;s of hectic fever, which in time &s;eldom fails of having a fatal tendency, and where a long continued per&s;everance in the u&s;e of the vital-air, with change of air, and corrobo|rants fail of &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hould have but little opinion of other remedies.</NOTE> THE Hydarthus is u&s;ually reckoned as another &s;pecies of Scrophula, which begins in the lymphatic glands about the knee-joint,
<PB N="49" REF="47">and is very painful and &s;low in its progre&s;s. It commences with a &s;light tumefaction of the cellular membrane, without any di&s;colouration of the &s;kin, attended with great heat and fre|quent pain. The &s;kin appears clear and &s;hi|ning, the joint becomes finally enlarged, the &s;urrounding parts feel ela&s;tic, the limb gradu|ally wa&s;tes, ab&s;ce&s;&s;es form in the vicinity of the joint, and a di&s;charge takes place, being, as a late writer ob&s;erves, &s;ometimes a vi&s;cid glairy fluid, at other times more purulent and
<PB N="50" REF="48">&s;ometimes entirely &s;anious and foetid matter. If the di&s;ea&s;e be not in this &s;tage detected, and its progre&s;s &s;topped, it proceeds on and extends it&s;elf to the bone it&s;elf. Thus the cartilages take on &s;ymptoms of inflammation, and are di&s;&s;olved. The bone it&s;elf is not exempted from undergoing the &s;ame change; and the &s;tructure of the joint on di&s;&s;ection is found melted down, more or le&s;s, into one hetero|geneous ma&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of a white glairy fluid mixed with matter, with pieces of carious bone of different &s;izes. The patient in this la&s;t &s;tage dies if amputation is not had recour&s;e to, and even the operation it&s;elf will not at all times prove &s;alutary, as the hectic attending the&s;e ca&s;es will frequently have too far reduced the &s;trength of the patient.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s M. P. aged 18 years, about three years ago perceived a &s;mall &s;oft tumour grow|ing about the middle of her throat, which continued gradually increa&s;ing in &s;ize till the

A variety of ap|plications had been made to the part, and un|der the care of &s;everal eminent men in this city, &s;he had taken the cicuta, burnt &s;ponge, and latterly &s;ea-watar. A &s;olution of common &s;alt in di&s;tilled water was al&s;o applied to the part by means of folds of linen cloth, dipped in this mixture and renewed every eight hours.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. HYDROCEPHALUS.</HEAD>
<P>HYDROCEPHALUS is ranked by &s;ome as a &s;pecies of Scrophula. The fir&s;t &s;ymptoms are great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, violent pain in the head, generally confined to one &s;ide, e&s;pecially above the eyes and in a direction between the temples; &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, an itching of the no&s;e, lo&s;s of appetite, a &s;al|low and &s;ometimes very white complexion. The bowels are in general co&s;tive, and it is with difficulty that &s;tools can be procured. The&s;e are generally of a dark greeni&s;h colour, with an oiline&s;s, or gla&s;&s;y bile, rather than the &s;lime which accompanies worms, and they are for the mo&s;t part extremely offen&s;ive. Febrile &s;ymptoms en&s;ue which exacerbate towards
<PB N="63" REF="61">evening, great drow&s;ine&s;s, languor and pee|vi&s;hne&s;s. As the di&s;ea&s;e advances, the pul&s;e is u&s;ually &s;low and heavy. In the commence|ment of the di&s;ea&s;e the pupils are very much contracted, but as the di&s;ea&s;e advances a dila|tation of the pupil takes place, chiefly in that eye, on which &s;ide the fluid is collected. The child will at intervals &s;cream out, and have frightful dreams. It will pick the bed-clothes, have <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum,</HI> and talk incoherently. In this &s;tate I have known children to linger out a fortnight and &s;ometimes three weeks, occa&s;ioning the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s to tho&s;e around. Doctor Percival ob&s;erves that Hy|drocephalus derives its origin &s;ometimes from inflammation, but mo&s;t frequently from &s;tru|ma and laxity of fibre, inducing glandular ob&s;truction and feeble action of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, all which di&s;po&s;e to an effu&s;ion of water in the brain. The ob&s;ervations of Bon|netus
<PB N="64" REF="62"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonnetus Sepulchretum Anatomicum.</NOTE> on this di&s;ea&s;e are the be&s;t to be found among the ancient writers, but I much doubt whether or not he ever ob&s;erved one half the morbid appearances in the heads of tho&s;e per|&s;ons he opened who died in con&s;equence of the effu&s;ion of water which he relates with &s;o much &s;crupulous exactne&s;s. The theory of drop&s;y as e&s;tabli&s;hed by Doctor John Brown and adopted by his pupils, and tho&s;e who practi&s;e on what is vulgarly called the <HI>Brunonian Sy&s;tem,</HI> is mo&s;t generally found to be &s;ucce&s;sful except|ing in a few in&s;tances where it has been inju|diciou&s;ly applied, for it is now proved by ra|tional practitioners that until the excitement is increa&s;ed by &s;uch remedies as will be here|after pointed out, that no ju&s;t expectations of cure can be entertained. Accumulations of water in the brain, producing tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which characterize Hydrocephalus, are the
<PB N="65" REF="63">&s;ame with every other ca&s;e of A&s;thenia, or Idiopathic affection, depending upon pure de|bility, which though extended to the whole &s;y&s;tem is more prevalent in the exhalent and ab&s;orbent parts of it, and more e&s;pecially af|fecting the exhalents and ab&s;orbents of the brain.</P>
<P>It is in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e that medicines can alone be of &s;ervice. When the affected &s;ide can be di&s;tingui&s;hed, the tre|phine &s;hould be applied. When the water is &s;uppo&s;ed, from the mildne&s;s of the &s;ymptoms, and their gradual progre&s;s, to be effu&s;ed be|tween the dura and pia mater, and when a very evident fluctuation can be felt, chiefly at the bregma, we ought to puncture without he&s;itation the dura mater: as this can be done without danger, it may give immediate relief, and may have &s;ome chance of producing a cure. Should it be thought expedient to perform the
<PB N="66" REF="64">operation, the dura mater &s;hould be punctured cautiou&s;ly with a lancet, at the &s;ide of the bregma, or as far as po&s;&s;ible from the &s;uperior longitudinal &s;inus. Tho&s;e who are attentive to the commencement and progre&s;s of the di&s;|ea&s;e, will with the greate&s;t facility di&s;tingui&s;h it from worm fever, to which in its early &s;tage it bears a &s;trong analogy, and for which it is frequently mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Hydrocephalus is di&s;tingui&s;hed from Apo|plexy by its being attended with fever, and from nervous fever by the paroxy&s;ms being very irregular, with perfect intermi&s;&s;ions many times a day. In nervous fevers the pain of the head generally affects the middle of the fore|head: in Hydrocephalus it is generally on one &s;ide of the head. Doctor Darwin, who&s;e opi|nion carries the greate&s;t weight, &s;uppo&s;es that the great di&s;po&s;ition in per&s;ons labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e, to lie down immediately after hav|ing
<PB N="67" REF="65">rai&s;ed their heads from off the pillow, is owing to the pre&s;&s;ure of the water on the large trunks of the blood-ve&s;&s;els entering the cavity, being more intolerable than on the &s;maller ones: for if the large trunks are compre&s;&s;ed, it mu&s;t inconvenience the branches al&s;o&punc; but if &s;ome of the &s;mall branches are compre&s;&s;ed only, the trunks are not &s;o immediately in|commoded. I think it is highly probable that where one eye is affected the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts in the ventricle of that &s;ide. Some authors a&s;&s;ert that this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom appears after the thir|teenth year, whereas it daily occurs in all ages from two years to thirty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide MONRO'S three treati&s;es on the Brain, the Eye and the Ear. The Doctor mentions the ca&s;e of a wo|man who had Hydrocephalus in her twenty-&s;ixth year.</NOTE>, though it attacks chiefly children.</P>
<P>A woman in the pari&s;h of St. Giles's Bloom&s;|bury was &s;eized with Hydrocephalus in her
<PB N="68" REF="66">twenty-&s;ixth year. She was treated by the medical attendants in the u&s;ual way, by having recour&s;e to bleeding, purging and other evacu|ations. She died on the twelfth day. Upon opening the head, I found the ve&s;&s;els of the brain very turgid, though &s;he had lo&s;t thirty ounces of blood. The anterior ventricles were filled with a diaphanous fluid. The foramen in the &s;eptum lucidum was &s;o di&s;tended as to admit the top of my little finger. The tuni|ca arachnoidea was opake and thickened. In all there were about four ounces and a half of water in the ventricles. In the pericardium there was found more fluid than is u&s;ual in a healthy &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy fact, that hundreds of children die annually of this di&s;ea&s;e who might perhaps under the care of &s;kilful per&s;ons have recovered.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="67">The remedies which have been mo&s;t com|monly re&s;orted to for the cure of this com|plaint, are Mercury, bli&s;ters applied on the head, calx zinci, &s;quills, opium, and digita|lis, and of late the fol. doron. German. Now as all the&s;e remedies generally fail, it is proper to propo&s;e &s;ome others.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as this di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umes the character of Hydrocephalus, the head &s;hould be imme|diately &s;haved, and from eight to a dozen leeches applied. After they fall off, bli&s;ters in the direction of the &s;utures ought to be laid on, and electrical &s;parks &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed through the head in all directions.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">For the particulars of this Ca&s;e, I am obliged to DOCTOR THORNTON.</HEAD>
<P>MARY Durand, aged nine years, living at No. 53, in Jermyn-&s;treet, laboured under Hydrocephalus. Among other &s;ymptoms, &s;he had an heavy oppre&s;&s;ion in the head, which obliged her frequently to recline it on a pillow: complete blindne&s;s of the right eye, and fits, which would frequently &s;eize her &s;o &s;uddenly that &s;he would fall down from her chair and remain convul&s;ed often for near half an hour, but without foaming of the mouth, as in Epilep&s;y. Doctor T. being applied to gave her the vital air with &s;teel and bark
<PB N="78" REF="76">internally, but the only alteration produced was an amendment of health. As her pul&s;e was remarkably &s;low, not more than 64 beats in a minute, on the tenth day, he gave her thirty quarts of oxygne gas, moderately diluted, the effect of which was an imme|diate return of vi&s;ion, and &s;he has remained free from head-ache and fits, with di&s;tinct vi&s;ion now above a year.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual method of treating drop&s;ies, by repeated bleeding, vomiting, purging, cli&s;|tering, evacuation by urine and the &s;kin; in one word, opening and relaxing all the excre|tories and weakening the activity of the ab&s;orbents every where, which is the unde|niable practice for the cure of a di&s;ea&s;e, the cau&s;e of which is that very &s;tate of ve&s;&s;els which the&s;e remedies produce, is &s;o ab&s;urd and contradictory, that I do not wonder that drop&s;y in all its forms, and particularly in the
<PB N="79" REF="77">pre&s;ent (Hydrocephalus) &s;hould baffle the art of practitioners. The cau&s;e of drop&s;y &s;o far as its re&s;pects the collection of water, is ea&s;ily explicable upon the doctrine of Doctor Brown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elementinae Medicinae, Chap. 627, Editio Nova, a THOMAS BEDDOES, M.

For the univer&s;al debility, and exhau&s;t|ed excitability, followed by laxity and atony, are chiefly predominant in the extreme red arteries, and the exhalents immediately continued from the&s;e, as well as in the com|mencements of the ab&s;orbent veins: and it is often urgent in a particular &s;et of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els only.</P>

<P>Mon&s;ieur Bonhomme <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Annals de Ch&eacute;mi&eacute;.</NOTE> a celebrated French chemi&s;t, &s;uppo&s;es the nature of the rachitic di&s;order ari&s;es on the one hand from the de|velopement of an acid approximating in its properties to the vegetable acids, particularly the oxalic, and on the other from the defect of pho&s;phoric-acid, of which the combination with the animal calcareous earth forms the natural ba&s;is of the bones, and gives them their &s;olidity.</P>
<P>From whence it follows, that the indication re&s;ulting from this propo&s;ition, if once adopt|ed,
<PB N="89" REF="87">would be, that the treatment of rachitis mu&s;t depend on two principal points, namely, to prevent the developement of the oxalic-acid, and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the combination of the pho&s;phoric-acid with the ba&s;is of the bones to which they owe their &s;olidity.</P>
<P>The author proves by experiments and ob|&s;ervations in the fir&s;t place, that alkaline lo|tions to the parts affected with rachitis, con|tribute to their cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o NICHOLSON'S Journal of Chemi&s;try, No. 4.</NOTE>, next that the calcareous pho&s;phate taken internally is really tran&s;mitted by the lymphatic pa&s;&s;ages and contributes to o&s;&s;ification; and la&s;tly, that the internal u&s;e of calcareous pho&s;phate, whether alone or com|bined with the pho&s;phate of Soda, powerfully contributes to re&s;tore the natural proportions in the &s;ub&s;tance of the bones, and accelerate the cure of rachitis.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88">The effect of the action of acids upon bones, was long before known; that is to &s;ay, that when deprived of calcareous pho&s;phate and re|duced to the gelatinous parenchyma which forms one of their elements, they lo&s;e their con&s;i&s;tence and become flexible. Hence it was already conjectured by various Phy&s;icians, that the rachitis was the effect of a peculiar acid.</P>
<P>Every one who is attentive to the di&s;ea&s;es of children mu&s;t have ob&s;erved a di&s;po&s;ition to ace&s;cence in the primae viae. The odour which characterizes ace&s;cence is often manife&s;t in their breath, and even their per&s;piration. The bile which is the natural cathartic of the body corrects this di&s;po&s;ition; but we gene|rally find a deficiency of this &s;ecretion in ra|chitic infants. It does not colour their excre|ments, and the acids accordingly are develop|ed in a very decided manner. They di&s;turb
<PB N="91" REF="89">the circulation and attack and &s;often the bones. As it is by defect of animalization that the&s;e acids develope them&s;elves, it follows that their character is analogous to the fermente&s;cible vegetable acids, and more or le&s;s to the oxalic acid: and that on the contrary, the animal acid of pho&s;phoric acid cea&s;es to be formed, and to unite with the animal calcareous earth; whence they are deprived of the principle of their &s;olidity.</P>
<P>In order to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of Mon|&s;ieur Bonhomme upon preci&s;e experiments, it is requi&s;ite to analyze rachitic bones compara|tively with tho&s;e of healthy individuals of the &s;ame age: and as it is known that the urine of rachitic &s;ubjects depo&s;its a great quantity of a &s;ub&s;tance of &s;paring &s;olubility and earthy ap|pearance, it would be advantageous to make a
<PB N="92" REF="90">complete analy&s;is of this urine and its &s;edi|ment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is known that when the urine contains di&s;engaged pho&s;phoric-acid, as happens to aged individuals, and in &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances of the &s;y&s;tem, if lime water be poured in, there is a &s;peedy depo&s;ition of calcareous pho&s;phate. It is al&s;o known that when a &s;olution of the nitrate of mercury is poured on the fre&s;h urine of adults, a ro&s;e-coloured precipitate is formed, which is a pho&s;|phate of mercury produced by the decompo&s;ition of the pho&s;phates contained in the urine. The&s;e two proofs are therefore extremely proper to a&s;certain the pre&s;cence of pho&s;phoric-acid, whether free or combined, in a fluid which in its natural &s;tate contains a remarkable propor|tion. Be&s;ides this principle, the urine depo&s;its more or le&s;s of &s;ediment, either gelatinous or an earthy appear|ance; and la&s;tly by evaporation, a &s;aponaceous and &s;a|line extract, in greater or le&s;s abundance is obtained by evaporation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Doctor Darwin is of opinion that if the Theory of Mon&s;ieur Bonhomme were ju&s;t, the &s;oft parts of &s;uch bones &s;hould &s;hew evi|dent marks of &s;uch acidity after death, which he believes has not been ob&s;erved. Nor is it,

The ignorance of parents is no le&s;s con&s;picuous, in the quantity of wine, fruit, &amp;c. they indulge children in; and how ea&s;y is it to trace the di&s;ea&s;es of children to the &s;ource from whence they originate.</NOTE> inattention to clean|line&s;s; cold either without moi&s;ture or with it, want of exerci&s;e, bad air and innutritious food, are the chief cau&s;es which bring it into action. I am inclined to think that this di&s;order fir&s;t takes its ri&s;e from the mouths of the lacteals
<PB N="94" REF="92">being ob&s;tructed by mucus; from a deficiency of bile, and the di&s;engagement of an ela&s;tic gas in the inte&s;tines during the proce&s;s of fer|mentation.

<P>Mi&s;s G. A. aged two years, very thin and tall of her age, about nine months ago, com|plained of a pain in the back about the third lumbar vertebra. She was &s;o weak in that part as always to require &s;upport behind.

Her countenance became pale&mdash;&s;he had a very craving appetite, and &s;hewed a great di&s;po&s;ition to eat chalk. Her belly became tumid and hard, and her breath|ing laborious, which la&s;t &s;ymptom aro&s;e from a very &s;mall thorax, much flattened in before, and at its &s;ides.&mdash;Emetics, cathartics, and ab|&s;orbents were the chief medicines pre&s;cribed as occa&s;ion required, and in the mean time an infu&s;ion of the Cinchonae with Tinct. Ferri
<PB N="98" REF="96">was given three times a day. Notwith&s;tand|ing &s;he grew daily wor&s;e, and was &s;o emaci|ated as &s;carcely to be recognized by her friends.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I recommended the vital-air which &s;he inhaled daily four quarts to &s;ix of common air. At night &s;he took pills compo&s;ed of Ferr. Vitr. and Ext.

This plan being pur&s;ued four months in conjunction with exerci&s;e, nu|tritious diet, and a fine open air, &s;he quite recovered, and is now a healthy girl.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e I related &s;ome time back a one of our Medical Societies in this City, where the cure was attributed by the Anti-Pneumatics (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) to the &s;teel medicine, diet, &amp;c. but as this medicine when given <HI>per &s;e,</HI> is ineffectual from the &s;mall

<PB N="101" REF="99">another portion of the oxygene unites with the hydrogene brought in the &s;ame manner, and forms water.</P>
<P>A portion of this oxygene which unites with the iron and hydrogene, becomes fixed on the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and gives out the heat which &s;upported it in a ga&s;eous &s;tate, while the remainder forming carbonic-acid gas which has a le&s;s capacity for heat than oxygene-gas, gives out a part of its caloric. Thus re&s;pira|tion is the cau&s;e of a continual extrication of heat in the lungs, which being conveyed by the blood to all parts of the body, is a con|&s;tant &s;ource of heat to the animal. We may therefore con&s;ider re&s;piration as an operation in which oxygene-gas is continually pa&s;&s;ing from the ga&s;eous to the concrete &s;tate: it will therefore give out at every in&s;tant, the heat which it held in combination.</P>

Mon&s;ieur Vacher, an ingenious Frenchman, invented &s;ome years ago a ma|chine of which he has given an account in the Memoires de l'Academie Royale de Chirurgie, tom. iv. accompanied with a plate.

Tho&s;e criterions are to be &s;ought after in the eyes, the no&s;e, the &s;kin, the tongue, the pul&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A knowledge of the pul&s;e, is highly nece&s;&s;ary to a good Phy&s;ician; though it is the &s;ource of a number of errors in practice, from the fal&s;e inferences, and ha&s;ty conclu&s;ions, which medical men draw upon the &s;lighte&s;t deviation or irregularity in this thermometer of the hu|man body. To the attainment of this object, many and con&s;iderable ob&s;tacles oppo&s;e them&s;elves: for the pul&s;e not only varies in quickne&s;s, at different periods of life, but different temperatures, and even &s;tatures, have cor|re&s;ponding varieties of pul&s;e. Thus the pul&s;e in women is ordinarily found to be about one &s;eventh quicker than in men; the proportion is &s;till greater in women during court&s;hip: in men of a &s;hort &s;tature, it is quicker than in tho&s;e who are tall; and in children than in adults. The pul&s;e is &s;aid to become &s;lower from forty-five to fifty or &s;ixty years of age, but afterwards to become quicker; a kind of hectic being &s;uppo&s;ed to be the u&s;ual concomitant of age, which makes the pul&s;e in|fantine pul&s;e. Thus the pul&s;e, which at the moment of birth, beats 134 &s;trokes in a minute, decrea&s;es in ve|locity to the period of manhood, when its medium may be reckoned at 75; is &s;tationary at 50 or 60, according to the degree of health, or firmne&s;s of con&s;titution of the &s;ubject; and then increa&s;es again as the body becomes enfeebled by age&mdash;the pul&s;e varies al&s;o at different times of the day. In the morning before breakfa&s;t it is &s;low|e&s;t; it becomes quicker after every meal, and that in pro|portion to the quantity and quality of the food taken in|to the &s;tomach, and becomes &s;lower again at night dur|ing &s;leep, if the &s;tomach has not been too much loaded, or defrauded of its nece&s;&s;ary proportion of food.

<P>To return to the &s;ubject of Scrophula, we find that an acrimony and acidity were long ago &s;u&s;pected to be the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;indeed late writers trace the whole train of &s;ymptoms to a prevailing acid with which children in particular are more af|fected than adults.

<P>In infancy, the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem bears a large proportion to the other parts of the bo|dy. This proportion gradually dimini&s;hes, as we advance in years. Hence we mu&s;t na|turally conclude that it has a peculiar u&s;e in children.</P>
<P>Galen's theory of Scrophula was, that it aro&s;e from a cold pituitous humour: others attributed it to a redundancy of fluids; and as &s;oon as chemi&s;ty was cultivated, it was traced to a prevailing acidity; and this has, with &s;ome little difference in expre&s;&s;ion, been embraced
<PB N="131" REF="129">by almo&s;t all writers on the &s;ubject down to the 18th century.</P>
<P>The theory of Boerhaave was, that it de|pended upon a &s;pi&s;&s;itude and lentor of the flu|ids. Then came to be adopted the doctrine of peculiar acrimony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The &s;olidi&s;ts," Doctor Valli, "have declaimed much again&s;t this doctrine and practice, but even among&s;t tho&s;e who have mo&s;t exerted them&s;elves in attempting to reform the &s;cience of medicine, we find &s;everal who have retained &s;ome of their ancient prejudices, and talked of acrimony in the blood, in the &s;ame way as it was &s;poken of in the old &s;chool. I cannot avoid comparing the&s;e Phy&s;icians to Apo&s;tates in Religion, who always retain &s;ome maxim of that in which they were educated.

My E&s;&s;ay on Chronic di&s;ea&s;es (Saggio &s;opra diver&s;e malattie croniche&mdash;edizione di pavia, anno 1792) has this principle for its foundation.

Doc|tor Cullen is of this opinion, although he at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pect|ed a peculiar acrimony in the blood; that all the &s;cro|phulous affections, &s;uch as the Tinaea capitis, eruptions in the &s;kin, indolent &s;wellings, &amp;c. are the effects of a morbific humour originally elaborated in the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, provided the&s;e affections are not hereditary or acquir'd by way of contagion; that other acrimonies which affect the &s;kin, have likewi&s;e their origin in the lymphatic-&s;y&s;tem; that the &s;pleen, under certain circum|&s;tances, &s;ecretes a fluid which attacks the gums, or pro|duces ulcers on the &s;kin." <BIBL>VALLI on Animal Electricity, page 303.</BIBL></NOTE> Doctor Cullen was
