<OPENER>Tune, <HI>"The Babes in the Wood."</HI></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>ALL you who wonder at the Times</L>
<L>That they &s;o hard do grow,</L>
<L>Come hither, li&s;ten unto me,</L>
<L>And you the Cau&s;e &s;hall know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Mu&s;es, your A&s;&s;i&s;tance lend,</L>
<L>While &s;uch Things I rehear&s;e,</L>
<L>As neither Goo&s;e nor Eagle's Wing</L>
<L>E'er wrote in Pro&s;e or Ver&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Man nothing le&s;s than Lord was made,</L>
<L>For nothing le&s;s was meant;</L>
<L>That all Things el&s;e he &s;hould &s;ubdue</L>
<L>He to the World was &s;ent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not content with this large Sway</L>
<L>Their Brethren <HI>Men</HI> &s;ubdue;</L>
<L>And all the Godlike Race is made</L>
<L>Sub&s;ervient to a Few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Earth and Heaven and all therein</L>
<L>Your Wonder high expre&s;s,</L>
<L>That rational Beings like <HI>dumb Brutes,</HI></L>
<L>Ought earthly &s;hould depre&s;s!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;o it is that wor&s;e than they,</L>
<L>Nought nat'ral they can claim,</L>
<L>Nor Hip, nor Haw, nor Nut, nor Sloe,</L>
<L>Nor ought that you can name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Gra&s;s or Nettles they could eat</L>
<L>The &s;ame would be deny'd;</L>
<L>For my Lord's Land and Herbage reach</L>
<L>Clo&s;e to the Highway Side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'A <HI>Hare</HI> or <HI>Partridge</HI> they may dre&s;s,</L>
<L>They're Nature's common gift;'</L>
<L>My Lord's Ground fed them, why &s;hould he</L>
<L>Of his RIGHTS be bereft?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'To fi&s;h then you will them allow;</L>
<L>The River's not my Lord's.'</L>
<L>Do not mi&s;take, <HI>the Water's his,</HI></L>
<L>And all that it affords.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To fi&s;h or hunt they have no Right,</L>
<L>Since they no Land can claim;</L>
<L>Whatever lives be it great or &s;mall,</L>
<L>The Land &s;upports the &s;ame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So they mu&s;t work to other Men</L>
<L>Whether they will or no;</L>
<L>For idle up and down the World</L>
<L>No Landle&s;s Men mu&s;t go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For why, in Truth, they cannot live</L>
<L>On Air or the Highway;</L>
<L>Tre&s;&s;pa&s;s they mu&s;t then on the Gra&s;s,</L>
<L>If &s;uffer'd thus to &s;tray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet no Laws are made that &s;o,</L>
<L>The Rich them Work may give;</L>
<L>But when they've &s;erv'd their Turn on them</L>
<L>They care not <HI>how</HI> they live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So wor&s;e than Hor&s;e or Oxen thus</L>
<L>Is their unhappy Lot;</L>
<L>For Hor&s;e and Oxen they maintain,</L>
<L>Whether they work or not.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Wages too by Law they &s;tint,</L>
<L>As Men, their Labour too,</L>
<L>Should have no Right, as be&s;t they can,</L>
<L>To &s;ell to that <HI>Vile Crew.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But not &s;o with their ill got Lands</L>
<L>Do they them&s;elves confine,</L>
<L>As much as they can get's the Rule</L>
<L>By which they let the &s;ame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like Tygers lurking for their Prey</L>
<L>So on the Watch they keep,</L>
<L>Le&s;t Tenants they by any Means</L>
<L>Their Labours' Fruits &s;hould reap.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If only Sixpence more they think</L>
<L>The Tenant he can pay,</L>
<L>As &s;oon as e'er his Lea&s;e is out</L>
<L>The &s;ame on him they lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like hungry <HI>Hawks</HI> the Farmers then</L>
<L>Are forc'd with Hearts full &s;ore,</L>
<L>The Poor at Market hard to gripe,</L>
<L>To &s;top the Landlord's Roar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If backwards in their Rents they run</L>
<L>Indulgence they find &s;mall,</L>
<L>Their Lord does like a rav'ning Wolf,</L>
<L>On Goods and Cattle fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Landlords what they thus have reav'd</L>
<L>In other Lands do &s;pend;</L>
<L>And while we've Landlords Things will wor&s;e,</L>
<L>But never once will mend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! there's a Land, as I hear &s;ay,</L>
<L>Where Landlords none there be!</L>
<L>O! Heavens! might I that happy Land</L>
<L>Before I die but &s;ee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Rents throughout that happy State</L>
<L>Each Pari&s;h deals &s;o fair,</L>
<L>That every Hou&s;holder therein</L>
<L>Does get an EQUAL SHARE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Meaning of this is, That after the whole Amount of the Rents are collected in a Pari&s;h from every Per&s;on, according to the full Value of the Premi&s;es which they occupy, &s;o much per Pound, according to Act of Parliament, ought to be &s;et apart for Support of the State in&s;tead of all Taxes; that another Sum &s;hould next be deducted for Support of the Pari&s;h E&s;tabli&s;hment, in&s;tead of Tolls, Tythes, Rates, Ce&s;&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. after which the Remainder belongs equally to all the &s;ettled Inhabitants, whether Rich or Poor, and ought to be divided equally among them.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of equal Shares of Land or Goods</L>
<L>They never once do dream;</L>
<L>But in each Pari&s;h, <HI>part the Rents:</HI></L>
<L>Which better far they deem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As all the World belongs to all,</L>
<L>So does a Land to tho&s;e</L>
<L>That dwell therein, the Likene&s;s then</L>
<L>Down to a Pari&s;h goes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So by this &s;imple RULE OF RIGHT,</L>
<L>All Things in Order move,</L>
<L>In Church and State 'mong&s;t Rich and Poor</L>
<L>All's Harmony and Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For as the Poor their nat'ral Rights,</L>
<L>And Lord&s;hips thus enjoy,</L>
<L>The Rich unenvy'd live in Peace,</L>
<L>None wi&s;h them to annoy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Lord have Mercy on all Lands,</L>
<L>This happy Change &s;oon bring,</L>
<L>That, Brethren-like, Men may divide</L>
<L>Their Rents, and gladly &s;ing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So if by Sickne&s;s or Mi&s;chance</L>
<L>To Poverty &s;ome wane,</L>
<L>Their Dividend of Rents will come</L>
<L>To &s;et them up again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> who Men's RIGHTS</L>
<L>Glo&s;s o'er deceitfully,</L>
<L>Our Common Claim to Rents will &s;tand</L>
<L>'Gain&s;t all your Sophi&s;try.</L>
