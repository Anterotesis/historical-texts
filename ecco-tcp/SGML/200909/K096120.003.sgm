<P>IN my way from Kalmykowa, on the 19th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1769, to the next &s;tation on the line, I met with a number of tarantulas, which every Co&s;&s;ack was ac|quainted with, and one and all declared, that their bite was harmle&s;s. Not many miles di&s;tant, on a tract of the high &s;hore of the river Jaik, before we reached the heights of the Inder&s;koian mountains, which ex|tend them&s;elves to the river, we &s;aw, almo&s;t every
<PB N="4" REF="4">
where, large flocks of antelopes feeding, which, as the wind was in our faces, did not fly before us, the &s;ight of this animal being imperfect, or rendered ob&s;cure, by four &s;pungy excre&s;cencies on the eye; nature, how|ever, has favoured them in the organs of &s;mell, and made them much &s;uperior to other animals in it's quick|ne&s;s and extent, for they will &s;cent a man or animal, if the wind is favourable, at two or three miles di&s;tance. Yet it is wonderful that the antelopes, which &s;eem to be con&s;tructed for &s;wift running, having wind-pipes almo&s;t two inches in diameter, large lungs and wide &s;kinny no&s;trils, &s;hould be &s;oon out of breath, more &s;o than any other animal. This I have often ob&s;erved in tame ones, which have neither been &s;cared or alarmed. The Inder&s;koian mountains, which are full of &s;tucco, are always crowded with them, till the Kirgue&s;e make their appearance, who hunt them ince&s;&s;antly. This ani|mal is very fond of the &s;mall, white wormwood, which grows here in abundance. They were, now, &s;o nu|merous, that the little e&s;cort, which attended me, &s;hot above twelve of different ages. We &s;aw here, al&s;o, in quantities, a peculiar &s;pecies of uncommonly beautiful lizards, running about in the &s;un, and a number of race-hares and marmots.</P>
<P>In a &s;alt di&s;trict, &s;ituated upon the heights of T&s;chornoijar, about 110 miles from the Wolga, where there is not only a &s;trong &s;alt-lake, but, al&s;o, &s;tone-&s;alt; and, again, about thirty miles ea&s;t of it, are two
<PB N="5" REF="5">
cle&s;ts in the mountains, which the Kalmucks hold as &s;acred, as do the Kirgue&s;e the Jlezkian mountain, and offer to them, as vows, harne&s;s, arms and other things, and give this fictitious &s;tory as a rea&s;on for their &s;o do|ing;&mdash; that their Delai-Lama had once pa&s;&s;ed a night on one and dined upon the other. In the cleft of one is &s;aid to be &s;ome water, and the Kalmucks &s;ay, that one of their countrymen, having once fallen into it, came out again in the Wolga, &s;afe and unhurt.</P>
<P>The Inder&s;koi mountains are &s;o full of &s;alt, that the Co&s;&s;acks, who &s;et out in &s;pring, to fetch &s;alt from this place, take as much fre&s;h-water with them as they think they &s;hall have occa&s;ion for, there being no fre&s;h-water &s;prings.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner reached the top of this mountain, than I was &s;truck with a large lake, re&s;embling an exten&s;ive plain, glittering with &s;now and encompa&s;&s;ed with heights, which, on a calculation I made, is above the level of the river Jaik. This lake may be ju&s;tly called a wonder of nature. It lies in a &s;traight line &s;carcely &s;even miles from the Jaik, about 125 miles &s;outh from Jaizkoi-Gorodok. I could not determine it's extent, but the Co&s;&s;acks &s;ay it is &s;ixty miles round; it is, ap|parently, about ten miles in circumference. It wears a round form and has many bays. The water is not very deep, for I rode into it near a quarter of mile and was not up to the girths of my &s;addle. The water of
<PB N="6" REF="6">
this lake is &s;o &s;aturated with &s;alt, that large cubic grains are con&s;tantly forming upon the &s;hore, when not prevented by moi&s;t weather, and it's borders &s;eem to be &s;owed with &s;alt. From the con&s;tant evaporation of this lake, the land, all round, is covered with a cru&s;t of &s;alt, &s;even inches thick. This cru&s;t is as hard as &s;tone, of a pure white, and, when broke, ex|hibits an extraordinary chry&s;talization in irregular bo|dies. Underneath this cru&s;t, lies a gravelly, grey and loo&s;e &s;alt, which may be ea&s;ily pierced. I ran a Co&s;|&s;ack lance, which was ten feet long, down into it, without finding any bottom; of cour&s;e, to what depth this &s;alt lies, cannot be determined. This is the &s;alt which the Co&s;&s;acks gather, being &s;mall and fit for u&s;e, loading their little waggons in the lake it&s;elf. They wa&s;h it with &s;alt-water, on the &s;pot, till it lo&s;es it grey colour. I dare not venture a &s;uppo&s;ition re&s;pecting the formation of this loo&s;e &s;alt. I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s my ignorance about the origin of that fine, white cubic &s;alt, called, by the Co&s;&s;acks, <HI>Tamo&s;a Kaja Sol.</HI> It re&s;embles &s;mall and large hail, promi&s;cou&s;ly &s;cattered on the muddy &s;hore and touching the ground only in one point. The large&s;t cubes were about the &s;ize of a &s;mall walnut, the chief no larger than peas and many not &s;o large as the &s;malle&s;t hail. Their whitene&s;s is dazzling to the eye and they are &s;o &s;olid, that it was with difficulty I could &s;queeze them between my thumb and finger. Their &s;ub&s;tance &s;eems to be a &s;ort of ala|ba&s;ter-like &s;tone, the parts of which are almo&s;t invi&s;ible
<PB N="7" REF="7">
with a magnifying gla&s;s. I could not di&s;cover any chry&s;talline configuration. This &s;alt keeps it&s;elf very dry, and, notwith&s;tanding it's &s;oft con&s;i&s;tency, di&s;&s;olves &s;lower in water than &s;tone-&s;alt. If you pour into the &s;alt-water a di&s;&s;olved alkali, it milks very much, but, if &s;uffered to &s;team away, by boiling, without any mixture, it has the appearance and quality of kitchen-&s;alt, though adhering much, in cru&s;ts, about the ve&s;&s;el in which it is boiled. This generation of cubic-&s;alt, is only found after a long drowth accompanied by &s;torms. When I was at the lake, on the 20th of Augu&s;t, it was plentifully to be met with, but on my return to it, in September, &s;ome tempe&s;tuous rains had &s;wept it quite away. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it may be con|cluded, that the cubic pieces of &s;alt, are formed by &s;ome attractive power from the particles of &s;alt evapo|rated from the lake.</P>
<P>This mountain is full of a variety of minerals, coals, &s;tucco, allum, marca&s;ites, belemnites, oy&s;ter-&s;hells, &amp;c. The Co&s;&s;acks pick up the&s;e &s;hells and prepare them as a medicine for children, again&s;t acidities, pouring water into the &s;hell and &s;craping off &s;ome of it's in&s;ide &s;ub&s;tance with a knife. They &s;up|po&s;e, that where a fla&s;h lightning falls, &s;uch a &s;hell will grow in the &s;pace of three years after. The Kal|mucks fetch, al&s;o, from this place, a kind of deep-red marle, in du&s;t, of which there are whole hills on this
<PB N="8" REF="8">
mountain, and with which they paint their tent-poles red.</P>
<P>Of the vegetable kingdom, this mountain boa&s;ts of the bu&s;hy orach, <HI>(Atriplex Glauca);</HI> the pretty &s;alt-wort, <HI>(Salicornia Arabica);</HI> and, another &s;pecies of this plant, not yet di&s;covered by botani&s;ts, <HI>(Salicornia Strobilacea).</HI> The latter grows on the low and moi&s;t part of the borders of the &s;alt-lake, and both the for|mer on the higher. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the thorny gla&s;s-wort and <HI>(Sal&s;ola arbu&s;cula):</HI> al&s;o, the thrift <HI>(Statice Suffrutico&s;a).</HI></P>
<P>As to the animal kingdom, I could have gathered plenty of in&s;ects from the flat borders of the lake, brought here by &s;torms on it's wide waters, wa&s;hed a|&s;hore dead, and perfectly pre&s;erved by the &s;alt-water. Among them were &s;everal rare &s;pecies, peculiar to the hotter parts of A&s;ia, the large, wandering gra&s;s-hop|per, a &s;maller &s;pecies <HI>(Gryllus Italicus),</HI> the &s;corpion-&s;pider <HI>(Phalangium Araneoides),</HI> and many more.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t I continued my journey along the line to the next &s;tation, and met, in my way, with a plant which the Kalmucks drink as tea. At Kula|gina-Gorodok, a little fort, on an arm of the Jaik, more &s;pacious indeed than the fort Kalmykowa, but not better built, though it has a church and a garri&s;on of Kalmuck and Tartar &s;oldiers, under an ataman,
<PB N="9" REF="9">
who commands the whole line, but who is, him&s;elf, &s;ubordinate to the commander of Gurjef. Some of the Tartars have, here, water-melon gardens, where this fruit thrives uncommonly well, and from whence they &s;upply other &s;tations, who are in want of this producti|on. Among the Kalmucks lived a Sungorian prie&s;t or gellung, who had ten &s;cholars <HI>(Mand&s;chi).</HI> His bur|chans were Aju&s;cha, D&s;hak-d&s;chimmuni, and another figure re&s;embling the former, which was holding his hands acro&s;s before him, having, in the right, the &s;a|cerdotal &s;ceptre, and, in the left, the bell; he called him <HI>Od&s;chirrdarr.</HI> All were neatly ca&s;t in copper and &s;trongly gilt. I will give my readers two other Kal|muck &s;tories, which may &s;erve as proofs of their au&s;|pices.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned that the white owl is much looked up to and con&s;idered as a &s;acred, prophe&s;ying bird. To the flamingo <HI>(Phoenicopterus ruber)</HI> known in Ru&s;&s;ia by the name of <HI>kra&s;na,</HI> or red goo&s;e, they &s;hew an ab&s;urd antipathy, whil&s;t they almo&s;t make a burchan of the other. They believe the latter to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an evil &s;pirit, look upon it as a bird omi|nous of ill, turn away their faces from it and load it with imprecations; but, of the red duck, which is al&s;o a &s;acred bird, they &s;ay it is the pure&s;t of all the winged tribe. The crane is al&s;o held to be one of the pure&s;t of birds and is, therefore, never killed.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">Near Kulagina, is a piece of Ru&s;&s;ian antiquity, worth notice. It is a con&s;iderable intrenchment, known to the Co&s;&s;acks by the name of Marinkin-Gorodok. Marinka, it is &s;aid, was a woman, who, in former times, committed robberies from this place. Nothing is more probable than that it owes it's fortification and name to Marina of Senomir, &s;pou&s;e to one of the fal&s;e Demetriu&s;es. Marinkin-Gorodok, lies about a mile north-ea&s;t of Kulagina, where the Jaik once had it's cour&s;e, though now at the di&s;tance of three-quarters of a mile. The intrenchment repre&s;ents a direct angle with oblique &s;ides: from one end of the intrenchment to the other, it is 335 paces. Within the intrenchment are, here and there, turf-hills, ari&s;ing from &s;ubterra|neous habitations, which the Co&s;&s;acks affirm to be there.</P>
<P>Before I quit this place, permit me to mention the condition of a patient afflicted with the lepro&s;y, a youth of twenty.&mdash;From his infancy, he was always &s;aid to be of an infirm con&s;titution, but never had any di&s;temper till the age of fifteen; at that period, two red blotches were ob&s;erved upon his face, as broad as two thumbs. He continued, however, in good &s;pirits and the blotches di&s;appeared before the year had elap&s;|ed. In the &s;econd year came forth, by degrees, over his whole body, reddi&s;h and blue &s;pots, accompanied by a den&s;ity of &s;kin, with which he was afflicted when I &s;aw him. With the lepro&s;y he felt a weakne&s;s in all his
<PB N="11" REF="11">
limbs and a &s;mart pain in the joints. This weakne&s;s and pain frequently attacked him to &s;uch a degree, that he was unable to move either hand or foot, yet his joints were not the lea&s;t &s;welled. He was once blood|ed, and his blood was thick and of a high-red colour. The pains were not always equally violent, but remit|ted for &s;ome days and were ea&s;ier: rubbing the joints with oil of turpentine relieved him. In the third year, his mouth and throat became full of little boils, which affected his voice, and made him, as it were, &s;hort|breathed. He had, al&s;o, a continual cough and dry|ne&s;s of mouth. Even before the lepro&s;y, he &s;eemed to have the itch and it continued with it. Notwith|&s;tanding this di&s;order, he had a good appetite and when the cough and pains in his limbs did not prevent him, performed his accu&s;tomed labour. His urine was reddi&s;h, but not unnatural. He never experienced any inclination to venery; the palms of his hands and &s;oles of his feet were free from the lepro&s;y, but the &s;kin hardened and peeled off from them; to remedy this, they were often anointed with fi&s;h-fat. The cau&s;e or the di&s;temper is unknown, but &s;everal of his mother's relations are &s;aid to have been afflicted with the &s;ame. His parents never refu&s;ed to attend him; they did not drink out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els, but lived with him, went into the &s;ame bath and never experienced the lea&s;t of the di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">In my way to Gurjef, I took notice of the caper|bean, <HI>(Zygophyllum fabago),</HI> which is, in that &s;alt quar|ter, a common weed and in great plenty. It was now, the 22d of Augu&s;t, full of ripe &s;eeds of which they make capers, about A&s;trachan. As it was quite decay|ed, I could not determine it's &s;pecies; &s;o far I could gather, that it belongs to the &s;tar-flowers, <HI>(Compo&s;iti|florae),</HI> and it's leaves are of middle &s;ize, like tho&s;e of pur&s;lain. It grows up with &s;traight and branching &s;talks, about an ell high, and bears flowers on the point, which are &s;aid to be blue. The calix &s;eems like that of the hawk-weed, <HI>(Hieracium),</HI> and the &s;eeds hairy, <HI>(pappus pilo&s;us &s;e&s;&s;ilis).</HI></P>
<P>Near the &s;tation Sarat&s;chik, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the river Jaik, are the ruins of a mau&s;oleum and the remains of a Tartarian town, probably the a&s;ylum of a Tartarian horde, which time has obliterated. The bulwark and ditch is &s;till to be &s;een, and appears to be from three to four miles in circumference. In the middle of this area is a canal, which &s;erved as an a|queduct. Within the bulwark are many traces, foun|dations and vaults of brick-buildings, which &s;hew that in the middle of the town mu&s;t have &s;tood &s;ome con&s;i|derable edifices. The bricks are oblong and tolerably large: there are, al&s;o, &s;ome pieces of brown &s;tones, with impre&s;&s;ions of &s;hells, no where el&s;e to be &s;een in this neighbourhood: likewi&s;e broken pieces of china-ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome white, &s;ome a beautiful yellow and high|ly
<PB N="13" REF="13">
glazed. As the whole &s;oil of this town is extremely wet and &s;alt, all the iron-work, which has been found, is &s;o much covered with ru&s;t, as &s;carcely to be known what it is. It is the &s;ame with the copper and &s;ilver found; the copper almo&s;t con&s;umed with verdigrea&s;e and the &s;ilver changed almo&s;t to the innermo&s;t part of the metal. I &s;aw there, in &s;ome of the Co&s;&s;ack hou&s;es, &s;everal coral-beads of divers colours, &s;ome little, ground and poli&s;hed topazes, and &s;ome &s;tones like cornelian. The &s;epulchres made here, are of brick, and often little articles of value have been found in them.</P>
<P>In this place, al&s;o, was a leprous Co&s;&s;ack, about forty years of age, who had been &s;ix years afflicted with this di&s;order. His fir&s;t &s;ymptom of lepro&s;y, was a large, high-red &s;pot upon his forehead, which pre&s;ent|ly di&s;appeared; &s;oon after, his body became red, all over, with terrible blue &s;pots, which made his &s;kin &s;o painful that he could not bear it to be touched. Even this di&s;appeared in &s;ix months. After this, he felt, by degrees, a pain, but without any &s;welling, in his arms and hands, which are now &s;o much withered, as to be u&s;ele&s;s. During the en&s;uing years, he felt the mo&s;t violent pain in his legs and feet: his legs &s;welled and the &s;kin became thick and hard, but he never had any ulcers in his mouth or throat. After &s;ome time, the &s;pots di&s;appeared again, and have not broke out &s;ince. Other matters, were as I de&s;cribed in the boy. This
<PB N="14" REF="14">
man had a relation who died of this di&s;order; yet no one is afraid to nur&s;e him or be about him. They all take care, however, not to eat or drink, out of his ve&s;|&s;els. The livid colour in his face and &s;welled appear|ances, began with the di&s;order and continued till I &s;aw him.</P>
<P>On the 22d of Augu&s;t, I reached the new-erected redoubt of Gurjef. The Jaik, here, winds and bends &s;o much, that it would be difficult to repre&s;ent it on a map, and, after all one's trouble, it might be looked on as que&s;tionable and unauthentic, particular|ly as the &s;tream &s;o often changes by inundations in the &s;pring. The whole di&s;trict is a &s;alt-mine and, in &s;um|mer, the flies are in&s;upportable. I do not know a, more &s;uitable puni&s;hment for malefactors than to tran&s;|port them here, and make them burn a&s;hes of the &s;alt-plants. Since I have been out, I never &s;pent &s;o di&s;a|greeable a day, as in this redoubt, waiting for a carri|age. Among other &s;alt-plants, I found the two fol|lowing, new ones, <HI>Polycnenum oppo&s;iti-folium</HI> and <HI>Salicor|nia foliata,</HI> and a &s;pecies of fly that crowded the air and tortured us exceedingly, met with about the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea, but new and unknown in Europe.</P>
<P>On the 23d, arrived from Gurjef, two boats, with Mr. <HI>Lepechin,</HI> whom I met here, but a &s;outh we&s;t wind, which continued all this day and the next, prevented my departure for Gurjef till the 24th,
<PB N="15" REF="15">
in the afternoon, for, it was impo&s;&s;ible to cro&s;s the Jaik on hor&s;eback, there being no bridges; I went, therefore, by water, and, by this means, avoided the flies and other vermin. The road to Gurjef, by land, does not exceed fifteen miles, but, by water, it was near thirty. We reached Gurjef about two o'clock in the morning, where I found Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Lowitz</HI> bu&s;y in his a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervatory. Gurjef was now the ren|dezvous of &s;cientific pilgrims, for, be&s;ides Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Lowitz,</HI> his A&s;&s;i&s;tant <HI>Inochodzof</HI> was there and Lieuten|ant <HI>Euler.</HI> We could not have cho&s;en a more di&s;a|greeable place for this purpo&s;e, but the ho&s;pitality of the commandant, Brigadier <HI>de Vege&s;ak,</HI> and his &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition, put us at our ea&s;e and made it plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Gurjef, though &s;mall, is about &s;even miles from the mouth of the Jaik, which empties it&s;elf into the Ca&s;pi|on &s;ea, is one of the mo&s;t regular and well-built, little forts about the river Jaik; it's works con&s;i&s;t of a &s;trong, &s;quare brick-wall with ba&s;tions on it's angles. The place has but one gate facing the river, which flows, near it. Except the hou&s;e of the commanding-officer, there is &s;carce a good habitation in the place. The church, like the hou&s;es, is built of wood, except the powder-magazine, which is of &s;tone. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of a company of infantry and &s;ixty Co&s;&s;acks, and here live a few merchants, from A&s;trachan. The place might become flouri&s;hing, if they would encou|rage a trade with the Kirgue&s;e and the &s;ituation, it&s;elf,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
was not &s;o unwhole&s;ome. The few merchants here, carry on a lucrative commerce with the Kirgue&s;e, but it might be rendered far more con&s;iderable. There is &s;carce &s;o unhealthy a place to be met with, from &s;pring to autumn. The fort lies in the middle of a &s;alt|mar&s;h, mo&s;tly overflown in &s;pring by &s;ea-water, driven by the &s;outhern winds into the mouth of the Jaik. Within the fort, they have rai&s;ed the ground by art, yet the whole is &s;o &s;alt and loamy, that it is never dry; of cour&s;e, we breathe con&s;tantly a &s;oul air, rendred &s;tinking by &s;ea-mud, even though the weather is &s;tor|my. Within doors, one is covered with wood-lice and tarakans, and as &s;oon as we leave the fort, the ox-flies, <HI>(Tabanus bovmus et occidentalis),</HI> make their attack upon us in &s;warms. It is no wonder that the inhabi|tants &s;icken under &s;uch torments, yet their di&s;orders are not &s;o general and mortal as one would &s;uppo&s;e, and the garri&s;on bill of mortality for &s;ix years, though they have no regular &s;urgeon, has been extremely &s;mall. Incautious &s;trangers generally pay the tribute of &s;ick|ne&s;s at fir&s;t coming, and the &s;curvy in the &s;pring here is a univer&s;al complaint; but the inhabitants cure them&s;elves by the leaves of the rapontic and the roots of the reed-mace, <HI>(Typha).</HI></P>
<P>The &s;altne&s;s of the mires is to be attributed to tho&s;e mo&s;t remarkable &s;alt-dews which, in &s;ummer-time, are common about Gurjef. This, to many, will appear an incredible phenomenon, but I am able to confirm
<PB N="17" REF="17">
it's truth by many credible witne&s;&s;es. It would be no|thing &s;urprizing to find a &s;alt-dew upon flowers and plants in &s;alt-ground, as they commonly per&s;pire a great quantity of &s;alt, but even the drops of dew that gather in the free air on &s;mooth bodies and the moi&s;t|ne&s;s which enters our cloaths, have a con&s;iderable de|gree of &s;altne&s;s. Why then &s;hould it be &s;urprizing, that chemi&s;ts, by a reiterated di&s;&s;olution and evapora|tion of &s;alt, have found a certain diminution of the quantity, and hence conclude, that &s;alt may be di&s;&s;ol|ved into earth and water, and apparently united with both? I mu&s;t al&s;o take notice, that &s;alt-dew may be ob&s;erved higher up the Jaik and, undoubtedly, the pernicious dews are of the &s;ame kind in other hot and &s;ultry climates.</P>
<P>It appears that the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;oil, round Gurjef, ought not &s;olely to be a&s;cribed to the &s;ea-water, for it is only the detained water of the river that overflows this di&s;trict, and the Jaik, near Gurjef, is &s;carce, per|ceptibly &s;alt, though the &s;ea-winds blow. Be&s;ides, a little, &s;tucco rock, lying not above a mile and a half from Gurjef, we&s;tward, to every one's &s;urprize, in a low and miry ground, &s;eems a confirmation of the&s;e re|marks, to indicate &s;ome hidden &s;alt, and which may, al&s;o, be concluded from the &s;trong &s;altne&s;s of the wa|ter, which collects it&s;elf in holes made in this ground. The &s;tucco, here, as mo&s;tly on the Inder&s;koian moun|tains, is of the nature of &s;elenites and from this little
<PB N="18" REF="18">
hill, &s;ituated between T&s;chernaja Ret&s;chka and an arm of the Jaik, runs a bank of mu&s;cle-&s;hell ground, to|wards the &s;ea. The Kirgue&s;e hold this hill, like tho&s;e of Ilezkaja, &s;acred. They do not a&s;&s;emble here to ce|lebrate fea&s;ts, but believe that &s;ome &s;aint is interred therein and, therefore, frequently there bury their dead.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ition of concealed &s;alt here is more rati|onal from the &s;alt-lakes in the Kirgui&s;ian &s;tep, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, where the garri&s;on of Gurjef may &s;upply it&s;elf with &s;alt, gratis.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of fi&s;h found in the Jaik, crowd all the bays here and al&s;o the lake; but, the privilege of the Jaikian Co&s;&s;acks prohibits the garri&s;on from fi&s;h|ing with nets, yet the &s;oldiers have a method of catch|ing plenty, e&s;pecially barbel, in the &s;hallows, with a two-&s;piked harpoon.</P>
<P>All the &s;ide-waters of the Jaik are full of frogs, a|mong the&s;e there is a huge &s;pecies, which is al&s;o found in the Wolga, who&s;e voice re&s;embles the loud laugh of a man. It might, perhaps, be of &s;ervice to the French nation to &s;end a colony of the&s;e frogs into the rivers of France, for there is more fle&s;h on the hind|part of one Jaikian frog, than ten common ones, and they are equally as delicate. The miry bottom of the Jaik breeds al&s;o a great many river-crabs, and they
<PB N="19" REF="19">
are larger here than I remember to have any where &s;een, yet empty, lean and of a bad flavour, and as the crabs of the Wolga, when boiled, are but of a pale-red, tho&s;e of the Jaik become only of a yellow-grey. Here are, al&s;o, plenty of water-&s;erpents, <HI>(Coluber Hy|drus et &s;cutatus),</HI> and the common otter, with red &s;pots about his neck.</P>
<P>There is here an unde&s;cribable quantity of wild-fowl. The bittern, &s;everal &s;pecies of &s;ea-ravens, the lea&s;t not le&s;s in &s;ize than a pidgeon; the &s;poon-bill heron, brown, red, white and little white herons, and every other kind; night-ravens, among which is the large <HI>Tantalus niger,</HI> the &s;ea-lark, <HI>(Hiaticula)</HI> in great abundance; but the mo&s;t curious bird they have, is the long-legged plover <HI>(Himantopus).</HI> The yelper, or Italian <HI>avo&s;etta (Recurviro&s;tra),</HI> &s;everal &s;pecies of gulls, <HI>(Larus cinerarius et naevius),</HI> al&s;o terns, <HI>(Sterna hirundo, naevia, nigra);</HI> and, among the birds of prey, the following hawks; <HI>Falco Lanarius, Pygargus, acru|gino&s;us et Ni&s;us:</HI> among the &s;mall birds, the ru&s;h-thru&s;h, <HI>(turdus arundinaceus),</HI> and the tit-mou&s;e, <HI>(pa|rus biarmicus),</HI> and quantities of all &s;orts of night-birds. In the fort it&s;elf, are many large bats, in &s;uch quantities under the roofs, that we may hear them &s;cream every where. We meet al&s;o, here, with all kinds of owls, particularly the churn-owl, <HI>(Caprimul|gus),</HI> and the <HI>&s;trix pulchella.</HI> The cau&s;e of their abode here, is an abundance of nocturnal in&s;ects, which affords
<PB N="20" REF="20">
them a rich &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Swans and flamingos, <HI>(Phoe|nicopterus),</HI> are only &s;een wandering in &s;pring; the&s;e birds are too &s;hy to live here, but in the more di&s;tant bays, they are knocked down with cudgels, at moult|ing time, by the Co&s;&s;acks, having no wing feathers to fly and protect them&s;elves. Here are, al&s;o, plenty of wild-boars, which the Co&s;&s;acks hunt with hounds, but not without danger, and kill them with guns and lan|ces. The&s;e animals frequent the ru&s;hy di&s;tricts, live on ru&s;h-roots and attain &s;o prodigious a &s;ize, that the males &s;hall, &s;ometimes, weigh above 600 lb. their co|lour is a yellowi&s;h-brown, but their heads and feet of an iron-grey or black. The bodies of the cubs are iron-grey, with yellow-white &s;pots, and are &s;o wild as &s;carcely to be tamed; the fat of the wild-boar is a hand deep, but it wa&s;tes almo&s;t all away in boiling; the fle&s;h, however, is &s;ound and has not the lea&s;t ta&s;te of a wild, ravenous animal.</P>
<P>Otter-hunting is a fine diver&s;ion in this country, and catching of &s;ea-dogs, which &s;ometimes come up the river from A&s;trachan. Their heads and fore-feet are &s;o overgrown with fat, that they re&s;emble rather bottles of fi&s;h-oil than animals. A great deal of &s;ea-dog oil is exported from A&s;trachan in the Ru&s;&s;ian trade, and is u&s;ed in the preparation of Ru&s;&s;ian hides, about Ca&s;an. With the addition of pot-a&s;h, they make of it, at A&s;|trachan, a grey &s;oap, allowed to be incomparable for
<PB N="21" REF="21">
cleaning of woolens. It is &s;old in &s;mall, &s;oft, flat cakes, by the name of A&s;trachan or Tartarian &s;oap.</P>
<P>As to the vegetable kingdom, we find, about Gurjef, the &s;ame kind of plants as are the natives of all &s;alt &s;oils. One would &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e that, on &s;uch a &s;oil, any kind of culinary herbs would grow, but wee &s;ee the re|ver&s;e. The commandant has a garden, in which grows well, melons, cucumbers for pickling, beet, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, colewort, cole-rape, par&s;ley; and it would bring forth tobacco, celery, cauliflowers, potatoes and water-melons.</P>
<P>I went down the river, between the 25th and 30th of Augu&s;t, to the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, which, at the mouth of the Jaik, is of a grey-green colour, but further out, &s;ailors &s;ay, it is of a black-green, and that they often ob&s;erve a pho&s;phoric &s;plendor in it's waves.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;pian-&s;ea fi&s;heries, the beljuga-&s;tone, which has always, remained problematical, is often found in the larger &s;pecies of this fi&s;h, and commonly &s;old at the cheap price of a few rubles. According to fi&s;her|mens accounts, this &s;tone is always found in a &s;ack of the <HI>rectum,</HI> or fundament-gut, through which the fi&s;h depo&s;es it's excrement and &s;pawn. They are &s;ometimes found, al&s;o, in the large&s;t &s;orts of &s;turgeons. I have known &s;uch &s;tones weigh from one to three ounces; they may, with difficulty, be &s;craped with a knife.
<PB N="22" REF="22">
Among the Ru&s;&s;ian dome&s;tic medicines, the beljuga-&s;tone is of great importance, though it does not merit it. It is given to expedite hard travail, in di&s;orders of children and ob&s;tructions of the urethra, in &s;mall do&s;es, &s;craped and mixed with water. They a&s;cribe the&s;e and &s;ome other inconceivable virtues to a &s;tone often found in the bladder of wild-boars, and &s;old dearer than that of the beljuga, by the name of <HI>Kabannoi Kamen.</HI></P>
<P>That the beljuga-&s;tone is to be reckoned among ani|mal-&s;tones, and &s;hould not be taken as an auricular bone or other natural parts of a fi&s;h, is proved, be&s;ides the confirmed &s;ituation in which it is found, and their different &s;hapes; for, &s;ometimes, they are quite oval and &s;mooth, and &s;ometimes rough and &s;andy, triangu|lar and more or le&s;s flattened; their colour is bone-white and they are of a uniform texture.</P>
<P>'The Ca&s;pian &s;ea,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>is, at pre&s;ent, no more than a great lake confined within the land, but it is &s;uppo&s;ed, formerly, to have had a commu|nication with the Euxine-&s;ea and to have &s;pread over all tho&s;e va&s;t &s;teps, or de&s;arts, of the Jaik, the Wol|ga and the Kalmucks. The multitude of &s;hells &s;cat|tered over all the&s;e &s;teps, &s;uch &s;hells as are found in the Ca&s;pian &s;ea alone and are never to be met with in rivers, the uniformity of &s;oil in all the parts of the&s;e &s;teps, con&s;i&s;ting, with a very few exceptions, of a pure &s;and, the general &s;aline quality of the &s;oil, that
<PB N="23" REF="23">
continued equality of country, and that univer&s;al want of wood, &amp;c. favour this opinion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not to &s;ay &s;omething of the city of A&s;trachan, when we are treating of places &s;o near it, would be unpardonable. Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> did not vi&s;it this place him&s;elf, but Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> did, in 1769, and he tells us, that this city is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of meadows that border the Wolga, where the river divides into a number of branches, about &s;ixty miles from it's entrance, into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea; and is built on &s;eve|ral hills that lie within the compa&s;s of it's walls. It has a fortre&s;s; the city is &s;urrounded with walls, con|tains 2,541 hou&s;es, twenty-five Ru&s;&s;ian churches and two convents. The Armenians have two churches, the Lutherans one, the Roman-catholics one, and the Indians have a &s;mall idol-temple. It has a large metropolitical church, built of brick, an archiepi&s;copal palace and an archbi&s;hop. Here is a large, botanical garden and a chemical laboratory, where they prepare &s;alts extracted from plants, the bitter &s;alt of A&s;trachan, the juice of liquorice, di&s;til|led waters, &amp;c. Every Apothecary's &s;hop, through|out the empire, belongs to the crown and they ob|tain, from this place, every medicinal plant they want; the apothecary here e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;upplies all Ru&s;&s;ia with liquorice-juice and glaubers-&s;alts, and being near Per&s;ia, and, of cour&s;e, able to procure curious &s;imples from thence at a cheap rate, he is
<PB N="24" REF="24">
frequently ordered to &s;upply the drug-warehou&s;es with them, at Peter&s;burg and Mo&s;cow. In one part of A&s;trachan, is the imperial comptoir of the gar|dens, which contain above 300 per&s;ons. The&s;e fur|ni&s;h the court of Peter&s;burg with every kind of fruit, and are now e&s;tabli&s;hing vineyards.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the gardens of A&s;trachan, grow all &s;orts of Eu|ropean, culinary herbs, except the potatoe and the artichoke. They plant a great quantity of pimento. Pears, apples, cherries, peaches and mulberry-trees thrive exceedingly well; but, as caterpillars de&s;troy mo&s;t of the blo&s;&s;oms, they bear but little fruit. They lay their vines under-ground, all-winter, and, as the heats in &s;ummer are exceedingly &s;ultry and &s;howers rare, gardens are watered by wind-mills, which rai&s;e the water from running &s;treams into trenches, that run through the grounds and &s;ufficiently refre&s;h the plants without throwing it over them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This city having &s;uffered prodigiou&s;ly by a late fire, the court of Peter&s;burgh has ordered the bank to advance 170,000 rubles for building brick-hou&s;es, which the inhabitants were to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, on paying the net co&s;t of the building. The poor to be allowed ten years to pay the money, but the&s;e buildings are carried on &s;o &s;low, that many generati|ons will pa&s;s away before A&s;trachan is fini&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25">I returned to Gurjef on the 31&s;t, and, though we had a dreadful &s;torm before us, not a &s;ingle drop of rain fell upon us. As I went further on, I found that the rain had fallen like a torrent and rendered the roads &s;o bad, that our hor&s;es and wheels &s;unk upon the &s;alt-&s;pots &s;o deep, that we could not get them out for half an hour. This violent rain had extended it&s;elf further than the Inder&s;koi-mountains, for, on the 1&s;t of Sep|tember, I paid a &s;econd vi&s;it to the &s;alt-lake there. It was, at this time, full of Kirgue&s;e, either encamped or wandering about with their herds, yet, though I had an e&s;cort only of four Co&s;&s;acks, they behaved mo&s;t friendly and &s;ociably. The&s;e gue&s;ts had entirely dri|ven away the antelopes, who&s;e arrival here is always con&s;idered as the approach of the Kirgue&s;e, for they con&s;tantly fly before a Kirgui&s;ian encampment.</P>
<P>On the 2d of September, towards night, I came to Antenowa, in my way back to Jaizkoi-Gorodok, and, the &s;ame moment as I left it, aro&s;e a violent, hot hurri|cane, called, by the Tartars, <HI>Buran,</HI> from &s;outh-we&s;t, and continued during the whole night. The air was &s;o clo&s;e and &s;ultry, that we had almo&s;t lo&s;t re&s;piration. <HI>De L'i&s;les'</HI> thermometer was, the whole night, at 110 deg. and, after &s;un-ri&s;e, when the wind was abated, at 115 deg. Such &s;ultry &s;torms ri&s;ing from ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t, e&s;pecially in autumn, in the&s;e di&s;tricts, are not rare, and are looked upon as fore-runners of heavy tempe&s;ts. We had ju&s;t reached Ko&s;cha-Charof on the
<PB N="26" REF="26">
5th, at night, as the air was calm and &s;omewhat cooler, when &s;ome dreadful, tempe&s;tuous clouds, from &s;outh-ea&s;t, gathered over us and broke in &s;howers and unin|terrupted fla&s;hes of lightning, which rent the elements, and continued, for &s;ome &s;econds, in form of fiery co|lumns. On this account, we advanced but &s;lowly. At break of day, September 6, we reached Budarin and, in the afternoon, Jaizkoi-Gorodok, at the di&s;tance of 361 miles.</P>
<P>'The&s;e winds,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>are as hot as if they proceeded from the mouth of a furnace; they ge|nerally ri&s;e about two o'clock in the afternoon and blow till after midnight. During the time they blow, &s;heep will often fall down dead in numbers: the blood foams out at their mouths, and they &s;well and putrify &s;o fa&s;t, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave their &s;kins. A wind of this &s;ort was felt at Antibes, in Provence, in the year 1756. It happened during the greate&s;t heat of &s;ummer, which is well known to be very in|ten&s;e in that country; and the woods, at a few leagues di&s;tance from the town, having taken fire, whereby more than a thou&s;and acres were con&s;umed; it ap|peared to tho&s;e who were expo&s;ed to the wind, as if &s;calding water was thrown over them. The typhons of Egypt are of this kind.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jaizkoi-Gorodok.</HI> The tempe&s;t I have ju&s;t now men|tioned, put an end to the pre&s;ent &s;ummer, and we had
<PB N="27" REF="27">
not one perfectly agreeable day after it. It was time, therefore, to go to Ufa, where I de&s;igned to pa&s;s my winter; but, being de&s;irous fir&s;t of &s;atisfying my curio|&s;ity, by taking a view of &s;ome remarkable things in the &s;tep-mountains here, I went, after writing down my ob&s;ervations, on the 15th, to that mountainous di&s;trict, from whence &s;prings the brook Derkul and flows more than fifteen miles above Jaizkoi-Gorodok, on the right, into the T&s;chagan; and I &s;ent two &s;tudents on before me, to another brook.</P>
<P>A mile or two from the town, I pa&s;&s;ed the burial-place of the Tartarian Co&s;&s;acks, which is on one of the &s;teps. Here is a wooden hou&s;e of prayer and many grave-hills, having at each &s;outhern end a pole. Se|veral &s;uch ancient burial-places are to be met with be|tween both T&s;chagans and the Jaik, derived, perhaps, from the Nogayans that formerly re&s;ided here, for they are not Kirgui&s;ian tombs.</P>
<P>About eighteen miles from Jaizkoi-Gorodok, on a dry, hilly-&s;tep, is a high tumulus. Several Tartars were here encamped with their herds. A &s;alt-plant, which I had not yet &s;een, was here in full bloom, <HI>(A&s;|tragalus Cornutus).</HI> Whole flocks of bu&s;tards were here on the &s;tep and departing for warmer climes.</P>
<P>On the 16th, we &s;aw many wild goats roving at &s;ome di&s;tance, Towards night it began to rain and grew &s;o
<PB N="28" REF="28">
dark, that I was obliged to &s;pend the night in the mid|dle of a &s;tep, where we could &s;carcely gather as much bru&s;h-wood and reed as was nece&s;&s;ary to warm and dry our&s;elves. On the 17th, we returned to Jaizkoi-Go|rodok, during a continual rain. Larks, wild pidgeons and other wandering birds repaired, in great numbers, to the &s;outhern climates, which foreboded an early winter.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of September I &s;et out for Ufa; but, the day before I left Jaizkoi-Gorodok, a violent &s;torm ro&s;e from the &s;outh-ea&s;t and brought, about night, tre|mendous thunder and &s;uch heavy rains as could only be compared to a &s;pout; &s;o that, within an hour, the fields were covered with water &s;ix inches deep, and, in the cour&s;e of the night, the wind changed to the north-ea&s;t, and brought &s;now and fro&s;t &s;o &s;evere as to freeze the waters and make every place around us a &s;cene of ice. During this weather, crowds of cranes and bu&s;|tards travelled downwards along the Jaik, and va&s;t flights of &s;mall birds, a &s;pecies of Ortolan and equal to ours in flavour, <HI>(Emberizapa&s;&s;erina),</HI> ran about the roads without being the lea&s;t &s;hy.</P>
<P>The village Kargalin&s;kaja, through which we pa&s;&s;ed, not many miles from Orenburg, is delightfully &s;ituated on the north and right bank of the Samara. The hou&s;es, which are mo&s;tly well-built with &s;tone-foundations and provided with airy rooms, are in number 300, and the
<PB N="29" REF="29">
met&s;ched or hou&s;e of prayer, is a fine and plea&s;ing edi|fice. Mo&s;t of the Tartars here &s;ettled are of Ca&s;anian origin, but differ a little from the Ca&s;anians in their manners and cu&s;toms, and are a trading and &s;ub&s;tantial people. It will not then be wondered at, that they &s;hould &s;tudy their per&s;ons and have a little Tartarian gallantry among them. The&s;e people, like our modern Turks, clear away the hair from every part of their bodies, with an ointment of lime and ar&s;enick; and the women, in imitation of Oriental nations, paint their eyes and nails. The Tartarian ladies make u&s;e of a certain plant called <HI>Kina</HI> or <HI>Kna,</HI> dry it and reduce it to powder, which being mixed with allum and fre&s;h goo&s;e-dung, they bind, for one night, over their nails and it gives them a yellow-red colour, which, among our European beauties would &s;urely, as an ornament, be rejected; though it be an in&s;tance of Oriental ta&s;te. Spani&s;h-pa&s;te is an imitation of that u&s;ed by the Tar|tars and Moors, for extirpating their hair.</P>
<P>They grow a great deal of wheat about Kargalin&s;|kaja, of which they make a fine flour, notwith&s;tanding the &s;oil and &s;ituation is more unfavourable to this grain here, than in &s;ome other places; for, according to far|mers theory, wheat will do well in very open countries, where wood will not grow, and here there is little el&s;e than birch and white poplars. The country along the Samara, is &s;o rich with metalick ores, that one cannot travel half a mile without &s;eeing &s;ome mineral enclo|&s;ures,
<PB N="30" REF="30">
belonging to different manufactories at Oren|burg.</P>
<P>The badne&s;s of the weather and the &s;now, which be|gan to cover every part of the ground, would not per|mit me to make many u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, I therefore pa&s;&s;ed Orenburg and made the be&s;t of my way to Ufa, through many Ba&s;kirian villages and &s;tations. The Ba&s;kirs were now a&s;&s;embling them&s;elves with their hordes about their winter-quarters. They differ from other nomades, by living, during the winter, in huts built of wood, in the Ru&s;&s;ian way. Near the&s;e huts, they lay &s;tores of hay in high &s;tacks round about trees, to feed their cattle, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. Mo&s;t of their hou&s;es are very &s;mall and the room within is provided with wooden benches to &s;leep on. The Ba&s;kirians have a chimney on the right hand of the door, re&s;embling a cylinder, which grows narrower at top. It is open be|low about the height of a man, made with wooden &s;takes and bru&s;h-wood, well plai&s;tered with, mortar. In this chimney they burn faggots, &s;et up an end. Near the chimney is a little hearth, whereon they &s;et a boiler to dre&s;s their victuals, and this boiler has a par|ticular pipe to let out the &s;team. Their chimneys are well-contrived, but as the wood burns well and very bright, it hurts the eyes more than the &s;moke, of cour&s;e, they labour con&s;tantly under &s;ome ocular di&s;or|der.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">The principal piece of hou&s;hold furniture in the fil|thy hovels of the Ba&s;kirians, is a high bottle, like a leathern ve&s;&s;el, fa&s;tened on a wooden frame and always full of &s;our milk, or <HI>arjan.</HI> Whil&s;t the cattle yield milk and they have &s;tore of honey, the Ba&s;kirians live jovially and u&s;e no other drink than &s;our milk or mead; but, as they &s;eldom like to clean the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, the of|fen&s;ive &s;mell may ea&s;ily be conceived. In winter, or when travelling, they &s;upply the want of this drink by little chee&s;es <HI>(krut)</HI> made from very four milk and dried in the &s;moke; this they brui&s;e and &s;oak in water, which makes a &s;ouri&s;h drink. Their u&s;ual food is thin broth, which they &s;end with wooden &s;poons partly down their throats and partly over their beards. They &s;ow no more wheat than they want for their own u&s;e, and this is but little. Indeed it is little to be expected that they ever will become good hu&s;bandmen, as they are &s;o much taken up in breeding bees and hor&s;es, which enriches them &s;ufficiently for the indolent man|ner of life e&s;tabli&s;hed among them. They do not eat bread every day and are &s;aid to bake it like the fir&s;t men. Their women kneed, with unwa&s;hed hands, a cake with water and &s;alt and bury it in the hot cinders of the hearth; they then put a &s;tick into the cake and toa&s;t it before the fire, till it is brown.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Ba&s;kirian women, differs little from that of the women of T&s;chuwa. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference is in the head-dre&s;s, where, in&s;tead of that

long latchet, be&s;et with &s;ilver-coins, which flows down the back, being fa&s;tened to the cap; it is here fixed to a quadrangular conical plate, fa&s;tened on the opening of the cap on the top of the head, the whole richly de|corated with little &s;ilver-coins, or plates. Both &s;exes wear &s;hirts of coar&s;e linen, made of hemp, or from a thread &s;pun from the large nettle, very wide trou&s;ers, bu&s;kins or &s;lippers. The poor wrap their legs in rags and wear &s;hoes made of the bark of a tree. The net|tles which they &s;pin for lines, grow in a fat &s;oil near their habitations, and are dried in autumn with the hemp. After this, being watered, the out&s;ide rind is taken off with the hands, by breaking the &s;talk, and then beaten in a wooden mortar, till they are reduced to tow. As to their per&s;ons, they are, without exception, the fil|thie&s;t and wor&s;t behaved of all the Tartarian or T&s;chu|wan nations; but I &s;hall have an opportunity of &s;peak|ing of them again,</P>
<P>Before I could reach Ufa, I was obliged to pa&s;s the Uralian mountains, which are full of minerals and many of which are covered with wood, and the neigh|bourhood inhabited by Tartars, T&s;chuwanians, &amp;c. I pa&s;&s;ed a copper-mine, worked by the Ba&s;kirians.</P>
<P>Upon the rocky mountains, along the Belaja, which I pa&s;&s;ed in great ha&s;te, grows the &s;avin-bu&s;h, u&s;ed by the Ba&s;kirians, to &s;moke their &s;ick children with. They al&s;o put it over their doors, from an idea that it
<PB N="33" REF="33">
has a particular virtue again&s;t witchcraft. It differs not in the lea&s;t degree from the common &s;avin, <HI>(Sabi|na),</HI> except that it's blui&s;h berries generally contain but one, two or three &s;eeds. The fore&s;ts here produce con&s;iderable larches, which, like the &s;avin, is not to be &s;een we&s;tward of the Uralian mountains. On the old trunks of this tree, we find not only the medicinal larch-mu&s;hroom, <HI>(Agaricus Officinarum),</HI> which the Ba&s;kirians brui&s;e and &s;trew upon the wounds of cattle, but, al&s;o, a ro&s;in oozing out, which &s;ometimes is re&s;i|nous and &s;ometimes gummy, and di&s;&s;olves perfectly in water. By order of the imperial college of phy&s;icians, a great deal of this gum has been gathered in the pro|vince of Ufa, which, in pharmacy, may be u&s;ed in|&s;tead of gum-&s;enega or Arabian-gum. It's colour is not &s;o clear, but it has &s;uch a degree of vi&s;cidity or adhe&s;ion, that it may an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of foreign gums, in mechanics and manufactures. It is remark|able that a certain tree, a &s;pecies of the re&s;in-tree, &s;i|milar to this, produces &s;ometimes re&s;in and &s;ometimes gum; and I have now an opportunity of confirming an ob&s;ervation of the learned <HI>Dr. Rinder,</HI> re&s;pecting the larch-tree, that in &s;pring it produces a gum, in winter, a degenerated juice, but, in autumn, a real re&s;in. The &s;ame naturali&s;t has a&s;&s;ured me, that in April, when the larch i&s;&s;ues forth bladders, a fluid re&s;in may be gathered from it, in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to the bal|&s;am of Mecca. Nay, &s;ome pretend it may be extract|ed from the white fir.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="34">It may readily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that in the neighbour|hood of the Ural, there are many noble birds of prey. Here is a kind of vulture-hawk, and other beautiful &s;pe|cies of hawks, <HI>(Falco barbarus et arborarius),</HI> al&s;o di|vers kinds of eagles. A large &s;pecies of owls, <HI>(Stryx Uralen&s;is),</HI> is al&s;o very common here, though I never &s;aw them de&s;cribed any where.</P>
<P><HI>Ufa.</HI> I reached Ufa, after travelling 370 miles from Jaizkoi-Gorodok, on the 2d of October, wintered there very di&s;agreeably and did not leave it till April. In the vicinage of this place, on the high roads, are three or four hou&s;es of accommodation for travellers, kept by Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Ufa is an ill-built city and very much decayed. The neighbourhood being richly peopled with Ba&s;kirians, it's &s;ituation would be a bad one, if it was not a place of &s;ecurity again&s;t the inva&s;ions of the&s;e Ba&s;kirians and others. It contains about &s;ix or &s;even hundred hou&s;es, di&s;per&s;ed in irregular lines, on the bank of the Belaja, and, owing to a bend of that river, forms a kind of cre&s;cent. Torrents of &s;now and rain-water ru&s;hing down from the heights above it, encompa&s;s the city all round, and, the hou&s;es, being built on the declivity of a hill, have a good effect and contribute to it's &s;afe|ty, which now, indeed, &s;eems e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the peaceable di&s;po&s;ition of it's neighbours and the fortifi|cation of it's frontiers. The ancient works of Ufa are
<PB N="35" REF="35">
mo&s;tly decayed, and there is &s;carce a trace to be &s;een of that line of pali&s;adoes, that ran near five miles along the town and covered the fields and pa&s;tures belonging to this place, in any trouble or commotion: there re|mains only, now, &s;ome relicks of an old watch-tower.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the city, it's &s;ix churches in &s;everal quarters of it, and particularly it's &s;tone-built cathe|dral, &s;tanding with many other public buildings on an elevation, &s;urrounded with pali&s;adoes, give it the ap|pearance of an amphitheatre and make it look better than it is; but it is dreary enough in &s;pring when a traveller comes and at other wet times. The corrupt|ed manners of the people render an abode here the more di&s;agreeable, for there is &s;carce a &s;ub&s;tantial or civilized inhabitant, except tho&s;e per&s;ons who belong to the office of mines and manufactures, the city not being able to boa&s;t of a regular trade or a good ma|nufactory, except a few tanners, who have here a tan|mill, worked by one hor&s;e. Indeed they have no workmen. As to their trade, it has not been extend|ed further than to travel to Ca&s;an, to fetch goods to &s;ell to the Ba&s;kirians, whom they &s;upply at an exorbitant rate, and who come here to buy or to attend the court of ju&s;tice. The inhabitants indeed are &s;o carele&s;s and &s;o indifferent about improving their &s;tate and &s;ituation, that they &s;uffer the Ca&s;anian and Ufian Tartars to run away with the lucrative trade of honey and wax, and a few more important articles, as marten and boar-&s;kins,
<PB N="36" REF="36">
hor&s;es and cattle. But this inactivity is the more deplore|able, as Ufa, by it's &s;ituation, might become the chief magazine of the whole regency of Orenburg, if the inhabitants had the lea&s;t &s;pirit of trade in them; the tran&s;port by water being practicable through the Rama and Wolga, to the innermo&s;t parts of the empire, even to &s;ea-ports. By the communication of the Belaja with the other rivers and the arms or &s;ide-waters running from the Uralian mountains, rock-&s;alt is conveyed to great di&s;tances; for ve&s;&s;els are built here for this pur|po&s;e and always lying at anchor at Ufa.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Ufa, is inhabited on the we&s;t, &s;outh and north-we&s;t, by Ufian Tartars, related to the Ca|&s;anians, but &s;ettled here long &s;ince. They are very numerous, throughout all the land lying between the Belaja and the river Ik, which falls into the Rama. The Tartars are, of all the inhabitants of the Ufian di&s;trict, the mo&s;t indu&s;trious hu&s;bandmen and general|ly men of property; and, indeed it is no wonder, that by their economy, they &s;hould pro&s;per well in a coun|try abounding in excellent pa&s;turage and woods profu&s;e with all the advantages that may be derived from hunt|ing, fi&s;hing and breeding of bees. Their method of hu&s;bandry is this: they cultivate all the land round their habitations and divide a field into three parts, one of which lies fallow every year, in which fallow part they let their cattle run, which is as good as a dre&s;&s;ing. Thus are their fields fertile for years and fit for wheat,
<PB N="37" REF="37">
which they do not neglect. Should the fertility of &s;uch &s;pots fail, and they cannot find a &s;tep near enough to their villages, they will remove their wooden hou&s;es to &s;ome other place; on this account, they do not hedge in their huts, but, in winter-time, keep their cattle in inclo&s;ures, and, when the cattle are abroad on the &s;tep, in &s;ummer-time, &s;ow tho&s;e enclo&s;ures with hemp.</P>
<P>In their way of living, they are tolerably neat. Men of property have, be&s;ides their u&s;ual habitations, a &s;ummer-re&s;idence, with a Ba&s;kirian chimney and a large bench to &s;leep on. The way from one to the other is laid with timber. Few marry more than one wife, none more than two. In all their villages, they have clerical &s;chool-ma&s;ters, who teach their youth to pray.</P>
<P>The female-dre&s;s differs not very much from that of the Ca&s;anian Tartars. Their common dre&s;s is, like that of the Ba&s;kirians and the people of Tchuwa, made of coar&s;e linen, worked &s;lightly with the needle about the neck and wri&s;ts. Girls are never &s;een but in their be&s;t head-dre&s;s. The woman's cap &s;its clo&s;e to the head, is cut out in front, fa&s;tened underneath the chin and but|toned on the top of the head, the greate&s;t part of which is covered with old &s;ilver coins, or pieces of tin cut out to re&s;emble coins; but the front border of the cap is ornamented two inches broad with red coral beads,
<PB N="38" REF="38">
narrower about the cheeks, and another row of the &s;ame beads runs from the top of the cap down to the part that binds the cheek. From behind the cap hangs down a band, above three fingers broad, which pa&s;&s;es through the girdle and &s;o far is decorated with &s;mall coins and tin plates, but further down to the joint of the knee, with corals and fringes. Two other &s;mall bands, &s;imilarly ornamented, go from the cap to the girdle, to which la&s;t they are fa&s;tened by their fringe|ends. Behind the ears, is fa&s;tened to the cap, a brea&s;t|plate, be&s;et with &s;ilver-coins, proportionably orna|mented, and large or &s;mall, according to the wealth or rank of the wearer, hanging from underneath the chin down upon the bo&s;om. Over the head is a veil, the tops of which hang down on the back. Girls caps are quite round and not cut out upon the forehead; the brea&s;t-plate is very &s;mall and narrow, no large band hanging down on the back, only the two &s;mall ones, and &s;ometimes not the&s;e. They wear their hair, like the women, braided into two tre&s;&s;es hidden in the nape of the neck, and upon it they &s;ometimes pin a little e&s;cutcheon, ornamented with coins and fringes. Com|monly, their head-dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts only of coral-beads, as the be&s;t and rich head-dre&s;s is the gift of the bride|groom, when a young couple is going to be married. But among the more wealthy of the&s;e people, girls caps are al&s;o ornamented with coins. I &s;aw a girl, the front-point of who&s;e cap was much lengthened and car|ved in wood. I al&s;o &s;aw a girl who wore, as an orna|ment,
<PB N="39" REF="39">
two triangular flaps be&s;et with coins, and made round on the lower-part, which were fa&s;tened together on the forehead, behind and underneath the chin, and covered only the &s;ides of the head, leaving the whole head of hair bare. Except the&s;e little changes in dre&s;s, there is no difference between the Ufian and Ca&s;anian Tartars. Their language and manners are the &s;ame, for, in the di&s;trict of Ufa, they live promi&s;cuou&s;ly to|gether.</P>
<P>The environs of Ufa ri&s;e by degrees in con&s;iderable hills, which, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city, are over|grown with woods of mixed trees, and higher up the Ufa is &s;till more woody. The mountains are lime|&s;tone and &s;tucco, with, now and then, a mixture or bad alaba&s;ter. This di&s;trict has no ores, except a few veins of a copper that is not worth the digging. Pe|trifactions are very rare among the lime, yet I found &s;ome madreporites up the Ufa, and they &s;hewed me, in Ufa, a very large knuckle-bone of an elephant, which had been found with the head, &amp;c. and &s;ome other bones of this animal, in a wa&s;hed bank of the Belaja, above Ufa, and was in a tolerably &s;ound &s;tate.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o upon the heights, we&s;t of this city, &s;ome large over-grown tumuli, which have been open|ed many years. Three of the&s;e tumuli, &s;ituated on a very elevated &s;pot, &s;trike very much a &s;crutinizing eye. Some &s;ay, the&s;e were the tombs of governors,
<PB N="40" REF="40">
who re&s;ided here before this di&s;trict &s;ubmitted to the Ru&s;|&s;ian &s;ceptre, and it is al&s;o &s;aid that all neighbouring Ba&s;|kirians paid tribute to the&s;e governors. Indeed there are many monuments of antiquity above Ufa, which &s;hew that this place was inhabited by a people very different to the pre&s;ent. There are, on the other &s;ide of the Diouma, not thirty miles from Ufa, erections that certainly were not built by the pre&s;ent people; the&s;e are a kind of &s;epulchral chapels, built of brick, and have round them many Arabian or Koptian tomb-&s;tones, with in&s;criptions. Mr. <HI>Krafft</HI> has given us many. The in&s;criptions contain the name and quality of the per&s;on interred, the year he died and &s;ome moral &s;en|tence beneath.

<P>The pre&s;ent winter was not very rigorous, yet it was di&s;agreeable, on account of it's dark and &s;tormy wea|ther. The mo&s;t violent fro&s;t was felt in the third week in November, and, on the 23d, we had &s;torms in which many travellers, on the de&s;arts, lo&s;t their lives. The&s;e &s;torms continued the whole month of December, almo&s;t without interruption, yet the cold was not very &s;evere. The month of January was moderate, that of February very temperate, but the month of March concluded the winter with a &s;till greater fro&s;t, that con|tinued to the middle of the month, accompanied by a deep and univer&s;al &s;now, which was the principal cau&s;e of the late inundation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42">The birds of pa&s;&s;age appeared with the end of March, flying towards the &s;outh; from which quarter, after the river was freed from the ice, we &s;aw a great many common gee&s;e, <HI>(An&s;er Erythropus),</HI> &s;eeking a colder climate. Wood-cocks and the &s;ea-pye remained in great numbers, even before the ice broke, and &s;ought their food on tho&s;e heights that were not covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>Having &s;ent &s;ome of my retinue, in the month of February, back to Gurjef, near the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, in order to &s;pend the &s;pring there, I will, from the ob|&s;ervations they made, add here &s;everal remarks con|cerning the arrival of birds of pa&s;&s;age, in that more &s;outhern di&s;trict, not quite u&s;ele&s;s to natural hi&s;tory. The river Jaik began to break on the 5th of March. Long before this and in the latter end of February, all &s;orts of &s;ea-mews were &s;een in flocks upon the ice, which had not left the Ca&s;pian &s;ea during the whole winter. With the la&s;t of February arrived large flights of &s;wans, gee&s;e, ducks and bitterns, evidently from the we&s;t. Bitterns come from the &s;outh, but never from the north-we&s;t. The heron was the only bird &s;een &s;ingly, after the water was clear of ice: but the late&s;t, and about the middle of March, appear|ed the &s;poon-bill, heron and &s;ea-ravens, <HI>(Pelecanus Carbo et Pymeus).</HI> Land-birds and birds of prey, were at hand with the end of February. There was al&s;o &s;traying, at this time, a fine &s;pecies of large and black
<PB N="43" REF="43">
larks, <HI>(Alauda Per&s;ica),</HI> which, commonly, do not exceed the 50th degree, but &s;eemed to &s;eek their home, which is, probably, Per&s;ia and India. The hawk of pa&s;&s;age, <HI>(Falco barbarus),</HI> &s;eemed to come the late&s;t among all other birds of prey; yet there was one &s;hot, near Gurjef, on the 4th of April, though this bird &s;el|dom frequents tho&s;e flat countries, but inhabits the fa|mous high mountains in the province of Ufa, where they build their ne&s;ts and pa&s;s the &s;ummer. The la&s;t arrival of all birds of pa&s;&s;age, was a beautiful &s;pecies of quite green bee-eater, <HI>(Merops Tartarica),</HI> in the beginning of May: the&s;e dwell only in the vicinage of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea and are never &s;een higher up the river Jaik.</P>
<P>Swallows were &s;een on the 15th of April, whil&s;t the weather was warm and &s;erene; but as, on the 17th, the &s;outh and we&s;t-wind began &s;uddenly to blow north, and cau&s;ed a &s;harp fro&s;t till the 19th at night, the&s;e birds and other little ones di&s;appeared, yet became vi&s;ible again on the 20th, when the weather grew mild. This circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned a curious ob&s;ervation. On the 18th of March, I received, by one of my peo|ple, whom I had &s;ent to Gurjef, a common &s;wallow, which a Tartar had found lying in a field, apparently dead and &s;tiff with fro&s;t. This &s;wallow had &s;carce been a quarter of an hour in my room, which was mo|derately warm, than it began to breathe and at la&s;t it fluttered about the room, where it lived &s;ome days, till
<PB N="44" REF="44">
it died by an accident. There remains not a doubt, therefore, but that tho&s;e &s;wallows which have been found in winter in fi&s;hing-nets, clefts and hollow trees, apparently dead, may be made lively again by warmth; there being rea&s;on to believe that they are only be|numbed by accident, perhaps by &s;ome &s;udden autum|nal fro&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed thus the winter in &s;o torpid and extraordinary a &s;tate, which &s;eems to run counter to the laws of nature; and indeed we &s;hould find here, in win|ter, many more &s;wallows than we do, if they did not retire with other birds of pa&s;&s;age to a warmer climate.</P>
<P>The budding of trees and their bloom was, this year, a whole month later than it was la&s;t &s;pring, about the Samara, even &s;ome weeks behind the trees of Oren|burg, of which I had an account. The apple-tree, in the neighbourhood of Ufa, began to bud on the 20th of April, and was in bloom the beginning of May; not not much &s;ooner, the wild, black cherry, <HI>(Padus).</HI> and &s;ervice tree, <HI>(Sorbus);</HI> much later the plane, the hazel, the way-faring tree, <HI>(Opulus),</HI> the cornelian cherry, <HI>(Cornus Sanguinea),</HI> the elm, the linden and the oak.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Part II.</HEAD>
<P>I Now prepared to &s;et out to cro&s;s the Uralian moun|tains, in my way to the province of I&s;etta; di&s;|patched a &s;oldier on the 10th, with nece&s;&s;ary orders to mend the roads and bridges, and followed, my&s;elf, on the 16th. Some few miles from Ufa, on the right-hand of the road, is a deep hole, called by the inhabi|tants, <HI>Be&s;donnaja Jama,</HI> (bottomle&s;s pit). Three years ago a murrain among the horned cattle raged dreadful|ly,
<PB N="46" REF="46">
and great numbers died. They carried the carca&s;es of the&s;e and threw them into this pit, which occa&s;ioned a large troop of mad dogs to a&s;&s;emble about it, and rendered the di&s;trict &s;o dangerous, that a company of armed &s;oldiers were &s;ent out to clear them away.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about twenty-five miles from Ufa, I &s;lept, for the fir&s;t night, in a village that contains but ten hou&s;es, it's inhabitants are of that &s;ort of people called <HI>Tepterei.</HI> The&s;e pay but a &s;mall poll-tax to what others pay, but mu&s;t furni&s;h the crown, gratis, with carts and hor&s;es, to tran&s;port the rock-&s;alt of Jlez|kaja, and the number of this people, in the province of Ufa alone, exceeds 30,000, con&s;i&s;ting of Tartars, T&s;cheremi&s;&s;ians and tho&s;e of T&s;chuwa. The Tartars, re&s;iding here, are the offspring of the Ca&s;anians and differ from the Ufa Tartars. I occa&s;ionally met with &s;ome of the&s;e people. The common dre&s;s of their women is a &s;hift of died linen or cotton; they wear on their head the veil <HI>Ta&s;tar,</HI> with a blue and green rib|band, laid round the head in form of a garland, as do the Ca&s;anian Tartar women, putting on the rich head-dre&s;s only at fe&s;tivals and on &s;olemn occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>They are here &s;o indu&s;trious in breeding bees, that &s;ome families have above 400 &s;tocks in the woods, which yield them annually upwards of 1600 lb. of ho|ney. Their method of breeding them is the Ba&s;kirian. They hollow the trunks of all &s;orts of trees, (but prefer

<PB N="47" REF="48">
tho&s;e of hard wood), twenty or twenty-five feet from the ground, if the height of the tree will admit it. When hollowed, they work it &s;mooth on the in&s;ide. The Ba&s;kirians are very clever at this work. All the branches below the hive are then cut off, to prevent the bears from climbing up, and notwith&s;tanding this care, and various means are u&s;ed to keep them off, and de|&s;troy them, the&s;e animals are very hurtful to the hive in the Uralian fore&s;ts; they frequently fix &s;harp knives, &s;ickles, and other iron weapons, &amp;c. on &s;everal parts of the tree, the cutting part turned upwards, &s;o that a bear will go up without hurting him&s;elf, but in coming down again, he wounds him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to lo&s;e his life. They have a contrivance al&s;o, by which a bear climbing up touches a cord, which &s;hoots an ar|row at him, and pierces his heart. Others hang on the mo&s;t di&s;tant branches with long ropes, a large board, &s;o that it will reach to the hive, and there tie it with ba&s;t: the bear finds his &s;eat on this board convenient for opening the hive, &s;ets to work, gnaws through the ba&s;t to get at the hive, which lets loo&s;e the board, and off he &s;wings, when, if he is not immediately thrown down by the violence of the motion during his fright, he mu&s;t re&s;olve at a dangerous leap, or patiently remain. If he falls or jumps, &s;harp-pointed wooden palesare pla|ced underneath to receive him; if he &s;tays where he is, he is killed with arrows or fire-arms. Sometimes a bear is watched and killed either upon trees, or at night about the &s;tocks he has begun to mole&s;t, or near &s;ome

carca&s;e. In winter, they trace bears in the &s;now, hunt them with hounds, and kill them with lances.</P>
<P>Another enemy to bee-hives, is the bee-eater, which they &s;trive to keep off by &s;urrounding the hives with all kinds of thorns. Nay, the Tartars believe there are per&s;ons who&s;e very looking on a hive is injurious to the bees. To guard again&s;t this, they &s;u&s;pend, e&s;pecially before &s;uch hives as are near their hou&s;es, the bones of a hor&s;e's head, or other bones, that the eye may fir&s;t fall on the&s;e objects, and thus avoid the &s;uper&s;titious in|fluence of magic looks.</P>
<P>This whole di&s;trict is rich with martens of a good kind, who&s;e &s;kins will &s;ell from 2s. 6d. Engli&s;h, to 3s. and 4s. 6d. each, according to the goodne&s;s and the number of buyers. This therefore is an encourage|ment to the Ba&s;kirians, and other inhabitants, to hunt, and their method is, to trace the animal in the fir&s;t fall of the &s;now, and when they meet with it, pur&s;ue it with their dogs, or bring it down from the trees by a gun or an arrow. In many of the brooks there is fine otter-hunting. Indeed there are &s;o many of this animal, that they catch them with beam-traps, laying &s;ome fi&s;h or a crab for a bait. They kill al&s;o a great number of &s;quirrels, who&s;e &s;kins are &s;old with other furs, to the Tartars, who travel among them for the purpo&s;e; but marten &s;kins are by far the mo&s;t valuable. They catch now and then a bad &s;able in the Uralian fore&s;ts,

but it is &s;eldom. Elks and roes, are to be met with in the upper di&s;tricts of the mountains, but there is &s;carce a wolf or fox to be found, on account of the thickne&s;s of the fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>The only in&s;ect here worth notice, is the crane-fly, <HI>(Tipula polygama)</HI> and this for its extraordinary mode of copulation. About each female a&s;&s;emble ten, twenty, or more males, which lay entangled together with their legs. If one &s;eparates them, never le&s;s than two, but often three, or even four males, are found in clo&s;e con|nexion with the female. The&s;e crane-flies fly but lit|tle, but they run about like &s;piders, and are a prey to the glow-worm, <HI>(Cicindela hybrida, et Sylvatica.)</HI></P>
<P>On the 19th of May, I reached the Sym&s;koi iron|mills, the &s;ituation of which is uncommonly beautiful, being a little plain betwixt two woody mountains. The works are erected on a branch of the river Sym, where &s;almon are caught &s;ix or &s;even feet long, and a fine &s;ort of trout. On the water are two mills, &s;ix forges, and three hammer-mills, each mill working four hammers. Here is al&s;o an anchor-forge, and a furnace. The Sym is not navigable on account of its rapidity, of cour&s;e they tran&s;port their iron &s;ome di&s;tance on &s;ledges during the winter. They manufacture here from 50 to 60,000 puds of iron annually, each pud 36lb. Engli&s;h. The workmen are all &s;laves, but are paid a &s;ufficient &s;alary to live comfortably with their families. The work|mens
<PB N="50" REF="51">
hou&s;es are 160; a &s;tone-built church &s;tands on a vacant &s;pot near them, and a good wooden man&s;ion in which the mini&s;ter lives, who has a country-hou&s;e and a garden, the whole fortified with a brea&s;t-work of timber laid on each other, 2100 feet one way over, and 1050 feet the other.</P>
<P>In changing of hor&s;es at one of the villages, the Ba&s;kirians brought one of tho&s;e which they &s;aid was of the breed of Schaitan Kudei, and would draw me well through any difficulty. On enquiring into the nature of this breed, they told me, that the fir&s;t fire or father-&s;tallion, married the daughter of a mountain &s;pirit or devil (Schaitan) whom he met with in a ca|vern he made in an adjacent mountain, and that from this alliance this breed of hor&s;es &s;prang.</P>
<P>About forty-three miles further on, on the Uralian mountains is another iron-manufactory, e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1757. The number of hou&s;es here are 470. The church and fine man&s;ion of <HI>Jacob Twerdi&s;chef,</HI> who is principal director of all the numerous iron-manu|factories erected by his relations in the di&s;trict of Oren|burg, are built only of wood, but the &s;torehou&s;es and forges are built with &s;tone. The works here are all forti|fied, con&s;i&s;t of a double furnace, four forges, fifteen hammers, and an anchor-forge; be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a common forge, two furnaces to heat the bars, and a &s;aw-mill. They melt here annually 200,000 puds of
<PB N="51" REF="52">
raw iron to &s;upply the hammers. They fetch the ore thirty miles in the winter-time, and it yields fifty-&s;ix puds per hundred and more of raw iron: of this they manu|facture here 80,000 puds in bars, and the re&s;t is con|veyed to the other manufactories I have mentioned. All the&s;e are conveyed together to a newly erected manu|factory of three hammer-mills, and a &s;aw-mill, with 120 hou&s;es on the river Jurjus, where in &s;pring it is put on board ve&s;&s;els built on purpo&s;e, and carrying each 6000 puds.</P>
<P><Q>Dr. Pallas now proceeds to de&s;cribe two or three caverns in the lime mountains of Ural, which he vi|&s;ited, and this he does with the knowledge and accu|curacy of a philo&s;opher, but as they are not by far &s;o wonderful and curious as our caverns in the peak of Derby&s;hire, which have been often de&s;cribed, I tru&s;t my readers will con&s;ent to pa&s;s them over.</Q></P>
<P>On the 20th of May, &s;ays our author, I arrived in the village of Ni&s;&s;eba&s;ch, upon a brook of the &s;ame name. Here are a people called Me&s;t&s;cheraks, who, as often as required, are obliged to do the &s;ame military duty with the Co&s;&s;acks; the&s;e emigrated eight years &s;ince from a &s;tation on the river Ufa, into this di&s;trict, and pro&s;per exceedingly well, having a tract of fine, ara|ble land, &s;ituated between the mountains about the ri|ver Jurjus. Having &s;ettled among &s;ome Ba&s;kirians, they pay them an annual rent of twenty-five co|pecks,
<PB N="52" REF="53">
or 18. Engli&s;h each family, for as much land as they can or will cultivate, be&s;ides pa&s;ture and wood. On the &s;ame footing are all other Tartarian villages that are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the country of the Ba&s;kirians. The &s;oil is here quite black and fertile to the utmo&s;t degree, and never needs manuring. The&s;e Me&s;t&s;cheraks en|clo&s;e their fields with hedges, and let their cattle run upon the lay fields. They turn up every new piece of ground with a Tartarian plough, but if the weather be dry, they put from four to &s;ix hor&s;es to it. In moi&s;t weather, and on all other occa&s;ions they u&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ian plough. In &s;uch new ground, the fir&s;t year they &s;ow hemp, and bear-barley. This barley produces ten or fifteen fold. Every ten or twelve years they leave a field and &s;eek a new one. They carry on a con&s;iderable corn trade with the iron-manufactories, and breed a great many cattle and bees. The country here abounds with foxes and martens, and I &s;aw a particular invention for catching woodcocks in winter, which de&s;erves notice.</P>
<P>They &s;tick forks here and there in the ground near trees in thin birch woods, where the&s;e birds mo&s;tly re|treat, and upon the&s;e forks lay a cro&s;s pole, one end of which is tied to the tree, the other re&s;ting on the fork, to which they tie bunches of corn. At a little di&s;tance from this they make a funnel of birch-rods about five feet high, by &s;ticking the rods in the ground as clo&s;e to each other as the wires in a cage, leaving one end of the funnel open at the top, and about an ell in
<FIGURE>

<PB N="53" REF="55">
diameter. In the opening or mouth of this funnel, they fix a wheel, which moves round an axis, and con|&s;i&s;ts of two hoops cro&s;&s;ing each other, and wound round with &s;traw and ears of corn. Now the birds fly fir&s;t upon the cro&s;s pole, placed near the tree, and if they fly on the ears of corn fa&s;tened about the hoops of the wheel, they can &s;ettle no where but on the hoop, when the wheel immediately turns with them, and lets them fall into the funnel, from which they cannot e&s;|cape.</P>
<P>Before I leave the&s;e Met&s;cheraks, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the women differ in dre&s;s from the Tartars, with whom they have the &s;ame language, the &s;ame manners, and the &s;ame Mahomedan religion. I &s;peak not of the men, for all the men in this country dre&s;s nearly alike. The reader I tru&s;t will form a better idea of their dre&s;s from the plate, than from any de&s;cription I can give. I &s;hall only remark, that the form of the cap, orna|mented in front with &s;ilver coins, and beads of co|ral, is the &s;ame with that of the Ufian Tartars; the principal difference is in the veil which hangs down from the hind part of the head, and in the wide &s;leeves.</P>
<P>Having heard of a burning mountain in the ad|joining di&s;trict of the Mur&s;alar&s;kian Ba&s;kirians, I went twelve miles to &s;ee it. This mountain is &s;ituated on a bend of the river Jurju&s;en. It is a very &s;teep one, and covered with wood, but on three of the highe&s;t
<PB N="54" REF="56">
parts, near a &s;outhern precipice, are &s;everal, bare, red|di&s;h &s;pots, which &s;pots are burning, and we drew near the place by a very dangerous path. Every thing here was flouri&s;hing, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> burning of this moun|tain, and the heat it &s;preads around, mu&s;t undoubtedly contribute.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;ide which is now the burning &s;ide, the mountain &s;eems to be 100 fathoms in perpendicular height. It has burnt on the ea&s;tern &s;ide only for the la&s;t three years, and that le&s;s violently than in the middle height, the whole &s;outhern &s;ide being burnt out; for the &s;ubter|ranean fires have exi&s;ted about twelve years. A &s;en|&s;ible Ba&s;kirian gave me the following cau&s;e of it. Ele|ven or twelve years &s;ince, a tall pine-tree that &s;tood we&s;tward, quite at the bottom of the middle part of the mountain, was fired by lightning, which con&s;umed the very roots of the tree, and thus penetrating the body of the mountain, it has &s;ince burnt inwardly, with|out interruption; yet &s;o that the fire has cea&s;ed at the bottom, and yet is far from having reached the top. The whole &s;outhern &s;ide, now bare, he told me was once, like other parts, overgrown with trees and bu&s;hes, which have been con&s;umed as far as the fire reached; namely, a &s;pace, of which the &s;malle&s;t diameter mu&s;t be 70 fathoms, the greate&s;t 100 and upwards. The fire al&s;o communicated to an adjacent &s;pot on the we&s;|tern &s;ide, but is there extingui&s;hed, and the place is now overgrown with all &s;orts of plants, particularly
<PB N="55" REF="57">
the fragrant dame's violet <HI>(he&s;peris Siberica)</HI> the lupin, after and wild liquorice <HI>(a&s;tralagus),</HI> The ea&s;tern part to which the fire pa&s;&s;ed three years ago, through a &s;mall part of the valley, then covered with birch-trees, is now quite green again, but yet burns with great violence, and exhibits almo&s;t as large fire-&s;pots as the middle part of the mountain.</P>
<P>The &s;tone of which this mountain con&s;i&s;ts, e&s;pe|cially in tho&s;e &s;pots which are burnt out, is partly a reddi&s;h &s;late, and &s;onorous, yet &s;eems to be a kind of lime-&s;tone, and partly a &s;oft, con&s;umed &s;tone, di|vided into thin, foliaceous layers, between which there appears to have been &s;ome other matter, now burnt to a&s;hes. In the ea&s;tern part, where I ordered, the men to dig, as deep as the heat would allow, I found the &s;tone in coar&s;e layers, but the deeper we went, the finer and loo&s;er it was. The layers &s;eemed to incline from we&s;t to ea&s;t, though in general I could find no determinate order, owing to the &s;inking of the ground in &s;uch con&s;umed &s;pots. In many places I met with a yellow ochre iron-&s;tone, and at the bottom of the ea&s;tern part lies every where, between the &s;tones, a light, red, friable marle. The burning &s;pots are full of large clefts and crevices, &s;o that it was dangerous to walk on them. In &s;ome places the men &s;unk into the &s;oft, burnt ground up to the knees, and could &s;carce get out again, without feeling the fire. From the open clefts ri&s;es continually a burning, hot vapour, which no
<PB N="56" REF="58">
one could put their hands near, and which on throwing birch-bark, or dried chips into it, they immediately caught fire. During &s;tormy and gloomy nights, red, thin flames or fiery vapours, ri&s;e to &s;ome height, yet there is no &s;ulphureous &s;mell, or coal-like vapours; the exhalation which ri&s;es communicating, no other &s;en&s;a|tion than that &s;uffocating heat, which i&s;&s;ues from a hot glowing oven, after the embers have been cleared out. As deep as we dug, there was no &s;mell, though we dug till the &s;tones were hot enough to hi&s;s with any moi&s;|ture, and burn the wooden &s;pades.</P>
<P>Not only on the out&s;ide, but within the burnt &s;pots, the ground was cold, and the common orach was growing on the places. The bottom of the middle part of the mountain was covered with luxuriant herbage, which, as the Ba&s;kirians told me, was not the ca&s;e, before it's burning. We &s;aw a great number of adders about the place, which were here before it caught fire. The Ba&s;|kirians a&s;&s;ured me, that, during winter, no &s;now would lie on it, that the &s;oil was always green, and had plants in flower through the whole winter.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Jurju&s;en, is another curio&s;ity. A little brook comes down a height adjacent to the river, and throws it&s;elf, after a cour&s;e of &s;ixty fathoms, with a &s;teep fall into the river, and in that little &s;pace of &s;ixty fathoms, turns four mills.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">In pa&s;&s;ing over a woody mountain, I could not but take notice of the va&s;t number of large and tall pine-trees and a&s;ps, either broke, leaning, or torn up by the roots by a hurricane, that had raged for five days together. The wool of the a&s;p might be gathered here in great abundance, if the people were not &s;o in|dolent; the branches might be lopt and carried to the hou&s;es, and when dry, the wool will &s;hake off. It may be worth the attention of a &s;peculator, whether a&s;p-wool in the common way, would not be a good &s;ub&s;titute for foreign cotton, and as it has a much better glo&s;s, and is con&s;iderably finer than cotton, it de&s;erves an attentive trial. I mentioned this to a learned friend, and he told me he had tried a &s;imilar experiment, with the wool of the willow <HI>(Epilobium)</HI> and it had &s;uc|ceeded beyond his expectations.</P>
<P>I next pa&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive manufactory of iron, where they make bars, and ca&s;t ve&s;&s;els, belonging to a merchant, who employs 1800 men con&s;tantly, and 500 more occa&s;ion|ally. The ore they u&s;e here is at the di&s;tance only of twelve miles, and produces half it's weight in good raw iron, which does not lo&s;e a third part under the hammer. The bar-iron here manufactured, is &s;o tough, that it will bear the hammer without heating, and they &s;end away annually above 100,000 puds, in barges that carry 7000 puds each, to different &s;ea|ports and places of the empire. Here I &s;aw them catching vultures by means of fall-traps, fa&s;tening live

pidgeons as baits. The&s;e vultures are &s;ent in great numbers to the Imperial court.</P>
<P>Travelling on, the chief of a neighbouring village came up to us with a large body of armed Ba&s;kirians, to &s;erve as an e&s;cort, but we declined his polite offer, as unnece&s;&s;ary. On account of the troubles which aro&s;e this &s;pring on the frontiers of the Kirgni&s;ians, every Ba&s;kirian had been ordered to be armed with lances, bows and arrows, for they are not allowed to carry any fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ms. Tho&s;e who inhabit the ea&s;tern part of the Ural and mo&s;t of the provinces of I&s;er&s;kaja, are much more &s;ub&s;tantial than any I have met with before. The excellent pa&s;ture in this di&s;trict, gives them a fine opportunity to breed hor&s;es; and it is not rare to &s;ee &s;ome per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s from 2 to 4000 pieces of this land. In &s;hort, this &s;tep is &s;o rich in whole&s;ome and nouri&s;hing pa&s;ture-plants, that it is pity but &s;uch as &s;ow artificial gra&s;&s;es, and make meadows, could get the &s;eed from this part of the world. The E&s;parcette, and Redy&s;arum of the Alps, be&s;ides innumerable &s;pe|cies of trefoil, codded plants, mugworts, and &s;tar|worts, are univer&s;al here, and they will agree with every climate.</P>
<P>The natural indolence of the Ba&s;kirians prevents their providing any &s;tock of hay for the winter, of cour&s;e they turn out their hor&s;es on the &s;tep, and oblige them to &s;earch for their food, by &s;craping off the &s;now,
<PB N="59" REF="61">
and if, as it often happens, a thaw &s;hould follow the fir&s;t &s;now and cover the ground with ice, the&s;e poor creatures are almo&s;t without food, and become mi&s;e|rably lean; &s;o that it is wonderful that under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, they &s;hould breed &s;o fine hor&s;es as they do; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that they deprive the colts of great part of their nouri&s;hment, by milk|ing the mares for kumy&s;s, and tying the colts all day to a &s;take.</P>
<P>In many parts of this province the Ba&s;kirians keep camels, but in &s;mall numbers, as the&s;e animals were taken off by a di&s;temper that raged among the great cattle a few years &s;ince. The fact is, that the pa&s;ture of the country, and the &s;evere winters, do not agree with the con&s;titution of this animal. They breed al&s;o very fat &s;heep. Be&s;ides their wealth in cattle, they are great hu&s;bandmen; they &s;ow nothing however but &s;um|mer-corn, barley and oats, and &s;eldom more than they want for their winter-provi&s;ion, added to their &s;moked chee&s;e or krut; for as their cattle yield but little milk at that time of the year, and they have no kumy&s;s, they would do very ill without krut. They a&s;&s;ured me, in general, that if a per&s;on gets drunk with good mare's milk, kumy&s;s, he will not have the lea&s;t appetite till the third day after; for this rea&s;on, they u&s;e it in &s;ummer, as their chief food.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="62">The dre&s;s of the Ba&s;kirian women on this &s;ide of the Ural, has &s;omething more elegant in it than the cu&s;|tomary dre&s;s of this nation. The habit is made of linen worked about the neck and wri&s;ts, the cap or <HI>T&s;cha&s;chbau</HI> decorated with &s;ilver coins, and other parts of their dre&s;s are the &s;ame with that of other Ba&s;kirian women, but the broad ornament which hangs like an order on the &s;houlders, and con&s;i&s;ts partly of coins, partly of coral beads, and &s;everal little toys, I never ob&s;erved among other Ba&s;kirian women. Here the women wear it from morning to night, and do all &s;orts of work with it, though it is inconvenient and much in their way. Indeed they do not like to be &s;een without it. They call this part of their heavy dre&s;s, <HI>Dilbuga,</HI> and men cover the reins of their hor&s;es with the &s;ame &s;tuff; from which one cannot form a very favourable idea of the re&s;pect which the Ba&s;kirians pay to their ladies. Indeed it is but little.</P>
<P>I now pa&s;&s;ed over the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Ural, which is very &s;teep, and alternately cloathed with birch-trees and larches. We found here &s;everal &s;treaks of ore, of which the mountain is rich, and mo&s;t of the ores con|tain &s;ome mixture of noble metals.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the mountain is a village con&s;i&s;t|ing of 100 hou&s;es, inhabited by Ba&s;kirians, and &s;ent

here to form a colony. They are &s;ub&s;tantial hu&s;band|men, and &s;ow all &s;orts of corn, except buck-wheat: the environs of this place exhibit many mineral curio&s;ities, which, though not very con&s;iderable, de&s;erve notice. On &s;ome &s;pots on the borders of the lake have been found &s;ome fine yellow topazes. Round the village one finds every where, on digging, an ochreous and &s;hining &s;tone, containing a &s;mall alloy of gold. North-ea&s;tward of the village is a height of bare rocks, thinly over&s;pread with wood. The rock is in a &s;oft &s;tate, and full of gold and &s;ilvery brilliancy, the layers of which run almo&s;t ea&s;t and we&s;t. On the report of &s;ome Ba&s;kirians, people were &s;et here to work, and a &s;oft vitrifiable matter over&s;pread with large purple-brown, irregular granates, and &s;ome other black mineral have been found.&mdash;The latter produced a gold alloy of five 8ths of a Solotnik, or dram, <HI>per</HI> 100 puds of ore. A little fur|ther we&s;tward, lies a black iron-&s;tone, and at the di&s;tance of two miles, in a low, mar&s;hy and &s;alt di&s;trict; under|neath the ground is dug a very white, though coar&s;e, earth, &s;amples of which have been &s;ent to the Imperial China-manufactory.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of June I &s;et off from the Sawod, in pur&s;uit of an allum-rock I had heard of, and cro&s;&s;ed a lit|tle brook in a ferry, which, though very narrow and &s;hallow, is &s;o rapid, that we were carried a great way down: we &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed it without a boat, but our hor&s;es could not keep their feet, and when we got

on the other &s;ide, they carried us over a &s;tep, but were too weary to climb a mountain beyond it, and it growing dark, we were obliged to put up with a very bad night's lodging. We cho&s;e the upper rocks of the height we were in, as the drie&s;t &s;pot of the whole di&s;trict. We thought to have made a fire, but, by ill luck, had not materials to &s;trike a light. Vainly did we try to produce fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together; of cour&s;e we were obliged to be contented with a dry &s;pot without fire, and by means of our cloaths, and branches of trees, we formed a Ba&s;kirian, travelling tent; underneath this we &s;tretched our&s;elves on our &s;addle-felts, and though this bed was very wet, the rain having penetrated through it, yet we &s;lept perfectly &s;ound till the next morning.</P>
<P>At dawn we ro&s;e bri&s;kly from our re&s;t, and break|fa&s;ted on a gla&s;s of water from an adjacent brook, which would have been an excellent reli&s;h, if we had had a fire to dry and warm our&s;elves; we therefore hoped to do it by quick riding, but even that could not be done, owing to the &s;teep and &s;tony ways, and the felled trees that lay in our way. At la&s;t we reached the al|lum-mountain, which was beautifully decorated with linden-trees, and all &s;orts of fine plants, e&s;pecially three different &s;pecies of lady's &s;lipper.

<P><PB N="63" REF="65">From this allum-mountain, we went to another, where is an i&s;ingla&s;s pit.

In this very quartz we found the i&s;ingla&s;s in ne&s;ts, in various po&s;itions, forms and layers, com|monly very impure, and of moderate tran&s;parency, about a yard in length. The pit is in &s;undry places fourteen feet deep, and the works are carried on at the expence, and for the profit, of the magi&s;trates at Ufa.</P>
<P>From this place I turned back to take a view of the china-earth manufactory, erected &s;ince the year 1752, where the porcelain earth is wa&s;hed and cleaned, and from thence carried to Peter&s;burgh, to be made into china. This manufactory is &s;urrounded with a wall of timber, and has two clean&s;ing-hou&s;es, a hou&s;e for drying the china, one for the ma&s;ter, ten dwellings for his eighteen apprentices, and a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tore-hou&s;e to depo&s;it the unwa&s;hed earth. A de&s;cription of this mu&s;t be agreeable to every reader. To wa&s;h this earth, which is dug about &s;ix miles off, and brought here, they have a number of ve&s;&s;els, each about &s;even feet deep. The raw earth is fir&s;t put into the large tubs with water, to &s;oak, divide, and di&s;&s;olve; here it is left &s;even or eight hours, that all coar&s;e and &s;andy parts may be &s;eparated from it, which is &s;ooner done
<PB N="64" REF="66">
if the weather is fine and &s;erene, than when it is gloomy. After this, the earth is poured into other tubs, through fine hair-&s;ieves, where it is to &s;ettle again, and there the thin matter is &s;trained through taf|fety &s;ieves, into the deep tubs, in which the pure, white china-earth &s;ettles by degrees at the bottom, and the water is drawn from it by tap-holes, which are made at different heights in the tubs, till there remains a fine &s;andy, &s;ediment; this &s;ediment is afterwards pa&s;&s;ed through three tubs, &s;tanding upon each other; it is fir&s;t poured into the upper one, and the earth there &s;ettling, the watery part that remains, is let into the one next under it; here it &s;ettles again, and la&s;tly into the lower tub. This is done that all the fine &s;and may be depo&s;ed from the water. This &s;andy &s;ediment is next brought into a hot-hou&s;e, and &s;pread over a &s;ail-cloth, fa&s;tened upon &s;everal cords on frames, in order that all the water may run out, and when the white, porcelain earth is become &s;olid, it is made into large tiles of about twelve pounds weight each. Of fifty puds of raw earth, they make about eight and a half of pure china-earth, and they prepare here, monthly, between three and four puds. Every winter the prepared earth is &s;ent to the regency of the province of I&s;et&s;kaja, from thence to the mine-office of the iron-manufactory of Blagodat Ku&s;chwin&s;koi, and from that place tran&s;|ported with the iron barges of the Imperial manufacto|ries, on the rivers Kama and Wolga, to the cabinet at Peter&s;burgh.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">The china-earth of this di&s;trict, known by the name of the earth of I&s;et&s;kaja, is of a beautiful white, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every requi&s;ite quality to make fine porce|lain.</P>
<P>My road led me along the borders of the river Mias, where we &s;aw great numbers of bu&s;tards, and beauti|ful red ducks feeding, which build their ne&s;ts in holes under ground. The latter bird quits this climate in July, as &s;oon as it's young ones are grown up, and returns in &s;pring with the fir&s;t birds of pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>I &s;taid &s;ome days in the fort T&s;chiljabin&s;kaja, which is the mo&s;t capital place in all the province of I&s;et&s;kaja, in order to &s;ecure my waggons and baggage in this place, which I de&s;igned for my winter-quarters, at the clo&s;e of this &s;ea&s;on. I &s;hall therefore give a de&s;cription of it at the end of the year.</P>
<P>Having left this fort, I went to vi&s;it the mines be|longing to Catherineburg, and began by the mo&s;t &s;outhern ones, directing my way to two &s;ilver-mines lately di&s;covered in the province of I&s;et&s;kaja. Having heard that one called Senar&s;koi, who&s;e works had been di&s;continued for four years pa&s;t, was opened afre&s;h, by a per&s;on deputed by the &s;upreme office of miners at Catherineburg, I went to it over Etkul&s;kaja Krepo&s;t. This &s;tep is covered with trees, and bears the fine&s;t pa&s;ture, containing gra&s;&s;es only proper to
<PB N="66" REF="68">
Siberia. The whole &s;tep of I&s;et&s;kaja is full, in June and July, of large, yellow flies, different from the com|mon ones, only in being twice as large, and of a pale, yellow colour. They covered almo&s;t all our hor&s;es, and in the neighbourhood of pools and lakes, the air is filled with them, e&s;pecially in &s;ultry weather, or when tempe&s;tuous clouds trouble the &s;ky. About &s;ix miles to the we&s;tward from the abovementioned fort, lie two lakes, called by the Ru&s;&s;ians <HI>Gorkje</HI> (bitter lakes) on account of the bitterne&s;s of their waters, which formerly are &s;aid to have been &s;weet. Both lakes have reedy borders, in which we met with a great many curious ducks, not &s;een in any other inland waters of Ru&s;&s;ia. Among them I remarked &s;ome quite black, called <HI>turpani,</HI> of which there are numbers here, and a very little, brown duck, with a light-brown bill, that &s;wims with it's hind parts entirely under water. The&s;e are very good divers, idle flyers, and very bad walk|ers. This latter bird, called from its voice, <HI>Sawki,</HI> is no where de&s;cribed; I have therefore given a repre|&s;entation of a young one and an old one, <HI>(anas mer&s;a).</HI> See the plate, and al&s;o the de&s;cription at the end of this volume.</P>
<P>I continued my journey along the line of intrench|ment, from fort to fort, up the river Uwelka, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal Co&s;&s;ack villages, where the inhabitants are &s;ub&s;tantial farmers. At one of the&s;e I was told that the Kirgui&s;ians had, on the 8th in&s;tant (June) made an attack on one of the forts, only 45 miles di&s;tant
<FIGURE>

<PB N="67" REF="70">
from this place, and had put every body into fear, and that of cour&s;e all had put them&s;elves into a &s;tate of defence, and kept a continual look-out. I was even told that the&s;e troubles had driven all the officers from the mine of Sanar&s;koi, and that, two days pa&s;t, all the workmen had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Being &s;o near, this did not interrupt my going; but the people repre&s;enting my journey as very dangerous, I took with me a little e&s;cort of armed pea&s;ants, and &s;ent to the fort of Sanar|&s;koi, for a detachment of Co&s;&s;acks, to wait my coming at the mine; yet I afterwards found that all my pru|dence was unnece&s;&s;ary, and that I might have done very well without any e&s;cort.</P>
<P>The heat on the 12th of June was almo&s;t in&s;upport|able, and De L'isle's thermometer ro&s;e in the after|noon from 110 to 105. The fir&s;t cau&s;e of the di&s;covery of this mine, was &s;ome pieces of a ma&s;&s;ive verdigrea&s;e, which were &s;ound here by a Tartar, who &s;hewed the &s;pot to a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e director, in 1761, who&s;e zeal induces him to find out all &s;orts of u&s;eful minerals in the province of I&s;et&s;kaja. He began that very year to dig upon the &s;pot, and made a regular mine-opening; and as &s;oon as they came to a certain depth, they found whole ma&s;&s;es of lead; whereupon the proprietor made a report to the &s;upreme mine-office at Catherineburgh, and &s;olicited for a privilege to con|tinue the works, engaging to &s;end all the ores which had any alloy of &s;ilver, to the manufactories belonging
<PB N="68" REF="71">
to the crown. Further I know not. The mine-office, that year, deputed &s;ome officers from Catherineburgh, and the mine was worked till the year 1765, at the ex|pence of government, when the death of the director, and other unknown rea&s;ons, cau&s;ed an entire &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and nothing &s;ince has been done. The miners &s;ent here, &s;topped only a few days, and did but very little; of cour&s;e, I could &s;ee but little, but &s;hall communi|cate all I was able to gather re&s;pecting the qualities of the ores.</P>
<P>On the whole, it appears that this is merely a clay mountain, in which the ore lies, &s;paringly &s;cattered in thin layers, and therefore no con&s;tant ore is to be here &s;ought as in the mountains higher up the river Oi. In this mine they have made but three &s;hafts and a wa|ter-gang which runs to the depth of &s;everal fathoms. As the mountain is quite loamy and &s;oft, to dig it was ea&s;y, but timbering it was more nece&s;&s;ary, and of cour&s;e more expen&s;ive, for the men could not go on a &s;tep without it. In the hard iron-&s;tones there is a gold-coloured bright|ne&s;s, and whole &s;treaks of a beautiful verdigris, al&s;o ma&s;&s;es of &s;olid copper. In the blue loam here dug, they wa&s;h out ma&s;&s;ive veins of copper ore, &s;ometimes a fine glittering lead, and &s;ilver &s;treaks, which amount to a tenth part of the earth. Though the whole &s;hewed no great alloy, yet they found a &s;ufficient quan|tity of ores, to make it pay for working. Springs, indeed, prevented their digging very deep, as they
<PB N="69" REF="72">
could not be &s;ufficiently turned off with engines, but the water that was taken out from the mines &s;erved to wa&s;h the ore.</P>
<P>From the alloy of the ore we dug here, the following is a &s;pecification. The coar&s;e, glittering lead with &s;ome verdigrea&s;e, produced 56lb. of lead per cwt. one pound of copper, and one ounce and a half of grains of &s;il|ver; the fine, glittering lead 61lb. of lead, and one and three eighths of an ounce of &s;ilver; the be&s;t copper-ore yielded 23lb. of copper, and four fifths of an ounce of &s;ilver, in eight pounds of lead. The &s;mall ore yielded but from two to four pounds of lead, the eighth part of an ounce of &s;ilver, and &s;ix pounds of copper, per cwt.</P>
<P>The other &s;ilver mine, called Kucku&s;cha, is &s;itu|ated at Kuku&s;chef&s;koi, upon a height that makes part of the mountain Akembet-tau, which is rich with ores, gently ri&s;ing, and without much wood, and runs along the Ui. The mine lies about two miles and a half &s;outh-ea&s;t from the river, and makes part of the Ura|lian mountains. The ores were di&s;covered here about ten years ago, by a Ba&s;kirian Sotnik, who revealed them to the late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the iron and copper-ma|nufactories at Ko&s;odur&s;kaja, who during all this time continued the works, and ordered all ore to be mixed and melted together. But another Ba&s;kirian took the ores of &s;ilver alloy into con&s;ideration, and upon his
<PB N="70" REF="73">
report, the &s;upreme mine-office &s;ent two deputies, who are empowered to keep all &s;ilver-ore for the u&s;e of the crown, and they pay a certain &s;um to the proprietors, to pay the miners. As the water was very high in the gangs, I could not enter the mine, but had an oppor|tunity afterwards of in&s;pecting them properly. Be|tween two &s;hafts is an open pit, in which the works were fir&s;t begun, and through which the miners go in and out. The bu&s;ine&s;s is done by hor&s;es, and &s;ome little dwellings are erected here and there for the ma&s;ter and the workmen. The bigge&s;t &s;haft was near &s;even|teen fathoms deep, but &s;ince they have improved the works, they have penetrated (in January, 1771) to a depth of twenty fathoms, and there found the ore richer in &s;ilver, and purer in copper. The ore is dug in a &s;haft that runs very regular from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and it's length above thirty-three fathoms. The &s;treak is &s;ome|times eight or ten feet &s;trong, and con&s;i&s;ts of a white and &s;at quartz, lying in a grey chertz, and cannot be got out, but by blowing it up with gun-powder. In the middle of the metalick &s;treak, the ore chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of a beautiful lazuli and verdigris, and in the&s;e ores we find a blacki&s;h, glimmering, &s;ilver-ore, over&s;hot here and there with a copper-colour, which upon trial yields from ten to twenty-four pounds of cop|per, and one of quartz, to one ounce and a half of &s;ilver, per cwt. con&s;equently 100 puds of the better &s;ort yield almo&s;t two pounds of &s;ilver. There is al&s;o among this ore another brown &s;ub&s;tance, which may be &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="71" REF="74">
to contain gold. During the latter months of this year, by con&s;tantly working, they collected from &s;eventy, eighty, to 100 puds of the &s;ilver ore, and the pud might be valued on the &s;pot, at from eight to ten copecs, each copec one halfpenny Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>There is little doubt, but this mountain might be|come more productive, if it was opened with a &s;earch-&s;haft, which certainly would lead to &s;ome fertile di&s;|covery, but as the matter depends only on the pre&s;ent proprietor, who &s;eeks his own intere&s;t in procuring a &s;ufficient quantity of copper, of which there is no want, and at a little expence, he has not &s;pirit enough to go further, unle&s;s he could &s;ee his advantage in &s;o doing. It is therefore the bu&s;ine&s;s of government to take it in hand, and that 'tis their intere&s;t, is pa&s;t a doubt, for, according to the opinion of a mine-officer, the whole, adjacent mountain, is full of &s;ilver-ore; and many other places within a little di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 15th of June I continued my journey to|wards Catherineburg. The u&s;ual way to that place, cho|&s;en by the copper and money-caravans from the manu|factories at Orenberg, go fir&s;t to the village Kara&s;&s;y, but I went a mile out of my road to &s;ee the pits from which they prepare the porcelain earth of T&s;chebar|kul&s;kaja. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the china-earth manufactory, I have already mentioned, which is now about &s;eventeen years, they have fetched the earth
<PB N="72" REF="75">
from this di&s;trict, which is found an ell deep under the &s;alt, black mire that covers the &s;urface. They find &s;ometimes &s;pots quite pure, yet full of yellowi&s;h veins, but clean&s;ing it with their hands, and little, wooden &s;pades, the remainder goes off in the wa&s;hing. The white parts lie about in an ocherous, yellow and &s;oft clay, Both the white and yellow earth when dug, look as if compo&s;ed of little &s;cales and folia, and when touched are very &s;oapy, yet do not ferment with acids.</P>
<P>Each apprentice is expected to dig every day, in &s;ummer, ten puds of pure, white earth, which cannot always be done. They begin digging in the middle of June, as in the&s;e &s;oils, adjacent to the mountain, the ground is often frozen an ell deep till towards the end of June.</P>
<P>In our way to the village where we meant to &s;leep, we had to cro&s;s the river Mia&s;s. There was no bridge over it, but as the river is commonly very &s;hallow, our de&s;ign was to ford it. However, when we came to it, we found it impa&s;&s;ible; for the &s;torms and &s;howers had increa&s;ed it &s;o much, that it had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it's banks, was rapid, and near ten feet deep. Our bu&s;ine&s;s then was to make a float, and a Ba&s;kirian hut which &s;tood near the river, an&s;wered our purpo&s;e; the float was made, and we got over. When we came to the village, the Ba&s;kirians had left it, had retired, with their flocks,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
into the cool mountains, and had locked their doors; but as a lock was no bar to us, we &s;oon had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hou&s;e or two, and &s;ettled our&s;elves at plea&s;ure. Near each hou&s;e, was a little, round oven, built with brick, with horizontal pipes, communica|ting with the oven at one end, and a hollowed pine tree, or cylinder, about &s;even feet long, &s;et up on end. This is a contrivance to &s;moke &s;heep and colt-&s;kins. They hang a &s;kin up acro&s;s a pole, on this cylinder, and then, by heating the oven with pine-apples, and foul-wood, the &s;moke i&s;&s;ues through the pipes into the cylin|der, and &s;mokes the &s;kins; done prior to tanning them, in order to make them impenetrable by rain, and give them a fine yellow colour, on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>Travelling on, we came to the enormous lake Uweldi in Ba&s;kir-Ujalde-Kuly. According to the general and unanimous calculation of the people, who inhabit the&s;e di&s;tricts, this lake, in circumference, is between thirty-five and forty-five miles, its length fifteen miles, and it's breadth nine miles, and they reckon &s;eventy-&s;even i&s;lands on it, nine of them having lofty woods.</P>
<P>Here are two other iron-manufactories in our way, &s;upplied with workmen who are obliged to work here for not paying the poll-tax to the crown of Ru&s;&s;ia; the proprietors of the manufactories pay that tax for them, and have their labour. Four thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred and thirty-eight men are employed in the&s;e two ma|nufactories,
<PB N="74" REF="77">
and they make, annually, 15,200,000 puds of bar-iron, which, in winter, is conveyed by the Ural to the river Ufa, and from thence tran&s;ported at high-water, in twenty or more flat ve&s;&s;els, to the Wolga.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict in which the&s;e manufactories &s;tand, be|ing, on account of the woody mountains, many lakes, bogs and &s;prings, cold and wet, it is exceedingly un|healthy, entirely unfit for agriculture, and &s;eldom a year pa&s;&s;es but they have a di&s;temper among their cattle and &s;heep, terminating by an internal inflammation. Again&s;t this di&s;order, they fumigate with the gum of the larch, and with &s;ucce&s;s. Every larch, by wounding it's bark, will ooze out a clear re&s;in, tough and yellowi&s;h, which, if fre&s;h, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the virtues of Venetian turpentine, and might be gathered for the apothecaries in all the mountainous parts of Siberia. This re&s;in fills &s;o much of the bark, and the young wood of the larch-tree, and renders it &s;o combu&s;tible, that there is &s;carce a young larch-tree to be found here, which has not received &s;ome hurt by fire, either by the burning of gra&s;s, or &s;ome other accident; and in &s;uch trees, the gum has a brown colour, di&s;&s;olves in water, is very like gum-arabick, and is known in Ru&s;&s;ia by the name of Or|enburg gum. The country-people gather no more of it than they want for their own u&s;e, and a&s;&s;ured me they made u&s;e of it as an emetic in cold fevers, and as an a&s;tringent, in long and ob&s;tinate ca&s;es of the <HI>fluor albus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78"><HI>Si&s;ert&s;koi.</HI> On the 19th of June I reached the manu|factory of Si&s;ert&s;koi, erected in the year 1733, on account of &s;everal, rich iron-ores di&s;covered in the neighbour|hood and then called <HI>Imperatrizi Anni Sawoda.</HI> Here are an anchor-forge, where bar-hammers, and all large manufacturing tools are made, a &s;aw-mill, two new hammer-mills, containing five bar-hammers, and one &s;teel forge; another with three hammers, two plate-fur|naces, one for copper, the other for iron, and a high furnace which contains a foundery, and covered with an iron roof.

<P><PB N="76" REF="79">The proprietor of the&s;e works has al&s;o a &s;tud, in which there are eight, &s;elect old, and five young &s;tallions, and the tame and governable behaviour of the&s;e ani|mals, which are el&s;ewhere quite wild and untamed, is &s;urprizing.

<P>The fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;her of this exten&s;ive manufactory, was Lieutenant-General <HI>De Henning,</HI> who was, at that time, chief pre&s;ident of the &s;upreme mine-office, at Catherineburg, and has been &s;ince one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable manufacturers for the &s;tate, till the year 1759, when the trade &s;eemed to dimini&s;h and was given up by him to the pre&s;ent proprietor, Mr. <HI>Turt&s;chaninof,</HI> for the moderate &s;um of 200,000 rubles, with all the iron-pits and mines belonging thereto, and a con&s;ider|able di&s;trict of wood, be&s;ides the ma&s;ters and work|men.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June, I made a little excur&s;ion to an a&s;be&s;tos mountain, &s;ituated in a &s;traight line, about eleven miles from this manufactory, though the &s;um|mer-road, which I travelled, was near twenty-three miles.

<P>It being impo&s;&s;ible to give a circum&s;tantial detail of the innumerable works which extend to a depth of twenty-five fathoms under-ground, and con&s;i&s;t of &s;hafts, &s;tream-works and different branches and tracts, I &s;hall de&s;cribe only the general &s;ituation and quality of the mountain, the different &s;orts of ores dug here and the chief works of the mine; and I &s;hall be the more particular, as few of my readers, I pre&s;ume, are acquaint|ed with the contents of a gold-mine. This mine, then, is &s;ituated three miles from the iron-manufactory of Pole&s;koi, which is a &s;imilar one to that I have men|tioned above. The ore lies, generally, in a clay or
<PB N="79" REF="82">
loam, which, being very &s;oft, is attended with little trou|ble and expence in digging. The different kinds of loam here met with are, a yellow, white grey, one penetrated with vermilion, a brown earth, and, on &s;ome &s;pots, a &s;now-white loam, much like pure, porcelain earth. It has been al&s;o ob&s;erved, that there runs through the middle of the one containing loam, a &s;mall mountain of the mo&s;t excellent, &s;now-white and beautifully half-tran&s;parent marble, very fit for poli&s;hing, and running, according to the miners' language, from noon to mid|night. This mountain will produce excellent marble for ornamental architecture and is the more valuable, as none equal to it has yet been di&s;covered in Ru&s;&s;ia. Excellent ores are here found and dug up in large ma&s;&s;es, either in &s;oft or hardened loams. On the right-&s;ide of the mountain, they dig only copper-ore, but on the left, chiefly a heavy and rich, vitreous, &s;teel-&s;tone, mixed with green and other copper &s;ub&s;tances, which-render it unfit for any thing, The gla&s;&s;y &s;ub|&s;tance, which compo&s;es mo&s;t part of the iron-ore, is talcous and it's clefts full of a tin-coloured, &s;oft blinde and often over&s;hot with verdigrea&s;e. They never dig this iron-&s;tone, except when it lies in the way and it is nece&s;&s;ary to remove it.</P>
<P>The marks they follow are, fir&s;t, the cinnabar &s;een in the loam, next, a brown-black, copper &s;ort of earth, found in form of kidneys or eyes, very &s;imilar to gar|den-earth, and which appears &s;ometimes &s;olid, like
<PB N="80" REF="83">
black chalk, and &s;ometimes &s;mooth, like white lead, and, la&s;tly, the loam's appearing of a green colour. The above-mentioned vermilion, which is mixed in the greate&s;t abundance with the white-grey loam, makes it look like red marble, and contains &s;o much copper, that when the tools, u&s;ed in it, are brought to the forge for repair, it is impo&s;&s;ible to harden them properly, on account of the copper &s;ub&s;tance which adheres to the iron, until the hearth has been &s;wept and entirely clean|ed. If this vermilion is looked at with a candle or light in the mine, one may &s;ee on it reddi&s;h &s;pots and intermixed, ma&s;&s;ive copper-du&s;t.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common and fine&s;t ore found in the mine of Gume&s;che&s;&s;koi, be&s;ides this coppery clay, is a &s;olid malachites of two different &s;orts like verdigrea&s;e: one is cru&s;ty and, though but moderately hard, is &s;u&s;cep|tible of an excellent poli&s;h, exhibits a mo&s;t beautiful deep green and turcois-like &s;tripes, wanting nothing but more &s;olidity. This green cru&s;t forms it&s;elf very often about a grain of ochre and the clefts of large &s;olid pieces often include a natural, chry&s;taline verdigrea&s;e. The other &s;ort is plumy and like plume-allum exter|nally, tenderly rayed, of a deeper colour, heavier and richer than the former, and velvet-like on it's natural &s;urface and, in digging, wears the appearance of &s;atin. Both are found together in lumps, like large and &s;mall kidneys, often weighing above eighteen pounds and taking on various forms. In the green cru&s;t, we may
<PB N="81" REF="84">
often ob&s;erve a &s;parry, &s;talactical &s;tructure and the &s;pars are, commonly, bored through longways, in the mid|dle. Between the cru&s;t and the white, over&s;hot &s;urface of this &s;pecies, one &s;ees black dendrities, like figures of uncommon beauty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this incomparable ore, which renders the mine more noble, one meets, often, with a loam-ore of a paler green, having the appearance and &s;olidity of lime-&s;tone; al&s;o, &s;ome quartz-like ne&s;ts, containing ores. Here, they dig a very curious violet, black, or granite-coloured, rich, copper-gla&s;s, &s;hooting in &s;hort, quadrangular pyramids, partly &s;pread upon the quartz|like &s;tone, or found in the clefts, and is one of the pure&s;t ores of the mine. On the red and hardened loam, is a beautiful, violet and reddi&s;h &s;ediment of la|zuli, &s;ometimes accompanied with plumy, copper|knots or ma&s;&s;ive tracts of copper. Once they found a pure and &s;oft copper, re&s;embling a web and formed in flat, thin threads, like plume-mo&s;s. Fine, ma&s;&s;ive copper-veins, are not uncommon, as I have remarked, in the loam, but, to my knowledge, they never found any large lumps.</P>
<P>It now remains to &s;peak of the works. The &s;pace hitherto worked out, from the northermo&s;t to the &s;ou|thermo&s;t &s;haft, is about 150 fathoms. Within this tract, they have thirty-one &s;hafts, to the depth of from &s;ixteen to twenty-five fathoms. As this mine is much
<PB N="82" REF="85">
troubled with water, there are always eight engines go|ing, worked by hor&s;es, for drawing it off. The&s;e machines are of a peculiar con&s;truction and cannot be kept a moment out of motion, or the deepe&s;t works would be drowned in a minute's time, and, for this purpo&s;e, they keep 400 hor&s;es, &s;ix to each machine, relieved eight times every twenty-four hours. The &s;tream-work, from the middle of the works, runs from the depth of nine fathoms to that of 350 fathoms, and above is thoroughly timbered, and every year re|paired. Through this &s;tream-work, a timbered canal of about fifty fathoms long, carries off the water. There are here many &s;hafts and pits filled up, and it &s;eems probable, that they are the remains of the ancient works: for this very rich mountain has been worked by that nation unknown to us, who&s;e indu&s;try and knowledge in mineralogy, I have had occa&s;ion to men|tion before; and the &s;outhern parts of the Ural are an evident proof of the &s;ame. The proprietor has a glove and a ragged, leather knap&s;ack in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was found la&s;t month in this mine, between white &s;tones at the depth of nine fathoms. Both con&s;i&s;t of rein|deers &s;kin. The glove is &s;o made of the head of that animal, that the ears &s;erve as a reception for the thumb, but both ends are open, &s;o that the glove may be put on the right or left-hand. Notwith&s;tanding the humid &s;ituation, this glove has pre&s;erved it's natural hair; but the knap&s;ack, which is above two feet long and one broad, has &s;uffered more from the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">In this mine 200 men are con&s;tantly employed, and, be&s;ides the&s;e, there is employ for 150 others, &s;uch as over&s;eers, &s;miths, harne&s;s-makers, &s;table-men, and carters, who bring here hay, gra&s;s, and timber, for they u&s;e here annually 5500 pine-beams. Be&s;ides this, they employ, in winter, above 100 pea&s;ants, who are obliged to work for their poll-tax.</P>
<P>Not far from this mine, are two quarries of marble, which have been opened a few years &s;ince, and from which the mo&s;t beautiful columns and pede&s;tals are made to embelli&s;h the imperial palaces.</P>
<P>A few miles from the&s;e quarries, are &s;ome old mine-&s;hafts, running deep into a mountain, from which there was formerly dug &s;ome gold-alloy; but as it did not yield &s;ufficiently, when other mines were di&s;covered, this was de&s;erted. But adjoining a fortified village, in the neighbourhood called Gornoi St&s;chit, upon the river Uktus, where was an iron-mill, and next to Ca|therineburgh, the olde&s;t belonging to the crown, but now neglected to give the young timber, in the vici|nage, time to grow, is erected &s;ome buildings for wa&s;h|ing of the gold-ores, brought from Bere&s;o&s;skoi, con|&s;i&s;ting of two &s;tamping-mills, and contrivances to &s;epa|rate the gold from the earth with which it is dug. In the&s;e places the workmen, are watched and guarded, that they may not purloin any of the gold &s;ediment. With this &s;ediment, after frequent wa&s;hings, there is a
<PB N="84" REF="87">
mixture of &s;ilver and iron; the iron-du&s;t is taken from it by load&s;tones, but the &s;ilver and gold are &s;ent to Peter&s;burg together, and there &s;eparated. They pre|pare here, annually, upwards of 70 lb. of gold from the be&s;t ore.</P>
<P><HI>Catherineburgh,</HI> June 23, 1770. I arrived at Ca|therineburgh on the 23d of June, towards night. This is a fine city, the re&s;idence of a &s;upreme mine-office, belonging to the mines in Siberia and the di&s;tricts of Orenburg, Ca&s;an, &amp;c. I &s;hall not enter into any de|&s;cription of this place, it having been accurately and faithfully &s;et forth by Mr. <HI>Gmelin,</HI> in his travels through Siberia; nor &s;hall I &s;ay any thing of the manufactories there e&s;tabli&s;hed for the benefit of the &s;tate; I will only ob&s;erve, that the place has been &s;ince embelli&s;hed with many fine, private buildings, a church elegantly built of &s;tone, that a copper-mint, which was then &s;u&s;|pended, is now at work again, and, that the iron|works of Werch-J&s;et&s;kaja, which formerly belonged to Catherineburg, are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Count <HI>Woronzof.</HI> I will proceed then to give a de&s;cription of the gold-mines, at a little di&s;tance from the city, which I in&s;pected on the 25th and 26th.</P>
<P>In my way there, I pa&s;&s;ed another manufactory for wa&s;hing of the gold, which con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;tamp-mills and other conveniencies. Here are employed thirty-five men, who prepare, every year, 90 lb. of virgin-gold.
<PB N="85" REF="88">
This place is near &s;ix miles from the mines, but they are obliged to &s;ubmit to this inconvenience, there not being water any nearer. There are two other wa&s;hing-places, be&s;ides the&s;e, but not much nearer to the mines.</P>
<P><HI>Gold-Mines.</HI> The mines of Py&s;chma are, by far, the olde&s;t of any gold-mines in this di&s;trict, and were di&s;covered in the year 1745. The fir&s;t of the&s;e has eight &s;hafts, but as the ore became wanting, without any farther hope, it was de&s;erted in 1765. A &s;econd was then begun, but as the ore here is incon&s;tant, they &s;eldom work in it, except when the miners can be &s;pared from other mines. There is a third here, which has now five &s;hafts and is very productive. Be&s;ides the&s;e there are two other con&s;iderable works, which are not much attended to, owing to the incon&s;tancy of the ore; but it is not &s;o with the mine Kljutkhe&s;sko, which was opened in 1763, with one &s;haft, and has been increa&s;ed with five others. The works run here very deep and are very much expo&s;ed to water. This mine is very rich in gold-&s;treaks, one of which is com|puted to run upwards of &s;ixty fathoms, and it's &s;ide-gangs, or &s;hafts, from twenty to thirty fathoms long.</P>
<P>Under the name of the mines of Bere&s;ofkoi, is un|der&s;tood tho&s;e four mines &s;ituated in the neighbourhood of the brook and manufactory of the &s;ame name, and now in work &s;ince 1752. That which promi&s;es be&s;t
<PB N="86" REF="89">
has thirteen &s;hafts, the &s;econd has ten &s;hafts, the third has &s;ix and the fourth, four. All the&s;e mines are mo&s;t actively worked and with the greate&s;t order and regula|rity. The &s;hafts, &s;tream-works and &s;ide-&s;hafts are very &s;pacious, clean and well-timbered.</P>
<P>The general &s;ituation and condition of the gold ores found here, are as follow. The metallick &s;treaks of the mountains are full of little, &s;tanding veins, which run from noon to morning and fall into the depth in different angles, from &s;ixty to eight degrees, from midnight towards noon. It is not uncommon to find &s;treaks which form a cro&s;s, but mo&s;t of them are direct. The&s;e &s;treaks which con&s;i&s;t of a thick quartz with clefts, are very di&s;proportionate in length and &s;trength. Some are &s;carce an inch, when others are more than two yards in thickne&s;s. It has been remarked, that a &s;treak, narrow in the beginning, increa&s;es further on, but tho&s;e which begin large, dimini&s;h &s;oon after. They are, commonly, from eight to ten fathoms long, ex|cept in the mine of Kljut&s;che&s;skoi, where they are much &s;uperior and exten&s;ive, and the principal &s;treak found in the engine-&s;haft, runs from &s;ixty to &s;eventy fathoms through the mountain, and is found equally con&s;tant in depth. The little &s;treaks are, u&s;ually, during the fir&s;t fathom, the riche&s;t, and at &s;even, eight and ten fathoms, are always poorer in depth, though they run much deeper. Such an ob&s;ervation appears rather extraordinary. Where the &s;treaks end,
<PB N="87" REF="90">
it is in &s;mall filaments. It is generally ob&s;erved, that the ores lie in a white or a white-yellow grey, mild, &s;ome|what fibrous, and glimmering loam, running from midnight to noon, from five to ten fathoms broad, and their length often extending to 200 fathoms into the mountain. This loam &s;eparates readily from the veins, but &s;ometimes the &s;treaks are environed with a grey|red, &s;potted chertz, which cau&s;es a great deal of trouble to &s;eparate them, and cannot be broke other, wi&s;e than by gun-powder. In this chertz or loam, the &s;treaks are &s;ometimes &s;carce half an ell, &s;ometimes three or four ells and &s;ometimes four or five fathoms di&s;tant from each other. On all &s;ides in the depth, the &s;treaks are bounded by a beautiful, minium-like, white and &s;potted, dry clay, which is here called the robber of ores. This clay yields a good, red colour, but when they come to it, no farther trace of the ore is to be hoped for; yet, there are &s;ome exceptions: for, in the mines of Bere&s;o&s;koi, the ores are u&s;ually found in the above-mentioned chertz, and it is attended with much trouble to knock them off. In the large &s;treak of the mine Kljut&s;che&s;skoi, which I have mentioned, a red|di&s;h, &s;andy and variegated &s;tone-loam is the di&s;tinctive mark of the ores, and in the &s;ame mine, the gold-ore, in another &s;haft, lies in &s;and-layers, mixed with quartz fo&s;&s;ils, but the fo&s;&s;ils them&s;elves &s;hew not the lea&s;t alloy of gold.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91">I will now de&s;cribe the gold-ores and other curio&s;i|ties dug therewith. The mo&s;t common ore in all the mines, con&s;i&s;ts in a dark or blacki&s;h brown, &s;olid iron-&s;tone, a &s;pungy &s;pecies, full of curious cubes, like dice, of which I &s;hall give a further de&s;cription, ac|companied with, a fine, brown-yellow, rich ochre, won|derfully mixed and confu&s;ed with quartz. In this brown matter and the ochre which accompanies it, the gold is inter&s;per&s;ed like a fine du&s;t. Even tho&s;e ores, wherein the gold-du&s;t is &s;o &s;mall as &s;carcely to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed with a magnifying gla&s;s, are not without gold-alloy, and with &s;uch gold, the wa&s;hing hou&s;es or lavatories are chiefly &s;upplied. The gold-alloy of the &s;treaks is not always uniform, but the riche&s;t ore breaks in ne&s;ts, though there is no vi&s;ible change in the appearance and condition of the &s;treak. There are al|&s;o found in the&s;e &s;treaks, &s;ome very curious gold-ores of a particular &s;pecies; among the&s;e, that which they call pumice-ore, de&s;erves a de&s;cription, as it often oc|curs. This is dug in large and &s;mall cakes, or ma&s;&s;es, in the mid&s;t of the gold-&s;treaks, from which it is &s;epa|rated by it's yellow-brown, &s;andy rind. The internal parts of the&s;e cakes re&s;emble, at fir&s;t, fine, &s;pungy, white bread or pumice-&s;tone, or, more properly, the tender, foliaceous texture of &s;pungious bones, and is uncommonly light; for the matter con&s;i&s;ts of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t tender folia, which cro&s;s each other and form little cavities, &s;ometimes larger, &s;ometimes &s;maller, and which, like pumice, will often &s;loat in water.
<PB N="89" REF="92">
The colour of this &s;ub&s;tance is white or yellowi&s;h, here and there over&s;hot with brown; and, &s;ometimes, it is found as grey as pumice-&s;tone and of the &s;ame thick texture, and this is the riche&s;t &s;ort. Within the cells of this ore, the foliaceous &s;ub&s;tance of which &s;eems to be of a quartz-like nature, a great deal of gold-du&s;t, as if powdered, lies &s;o loo&s;e, that if the &s;tone was broke it might be &s;haken out. Of all gold-ores this is, in proportion to it's weight, the riche&s;t, and the gold-du&s;t may be plainly &s;een in it and wa&s;hed out without any other trouble, and thirty-&s;ix pounds of this ore will yield from two to &s;ix drachms of pure gold-du&s;t. It is to be lamented, that it is not found very abundantly in lumps or ne&s;ts. Among the &s;ame ore, I found &s;ome con&s;i&s;ting of a coar&s;e texture, here and there flowing together in genuine quartz and exactly re&s;embling worm-eaten quartz; and, among the &s;pungy &s;ub&s;tances, &s;ome pieces contain, in&s;tead of gold, &s;mall particles of blinde or mock-lead.</P>
<P>But the common, brown, blacki&s;h ore is, in &s;ome places, of a very &s;imilar, light, &s;pungy texture, and it's &s;pungy parts over-run with lead-colour, but, neverthe|le&s;s, of gold-alloy. This ore breaks away in &s;mall, regular, cubic pieces, like dice, of a &s;pungy &s;ub&s;tance, a ru&s;t-brown colour internally, but, hard and &s;hining on the &s;urface, and each of their &s;ix &s;ides is &s;lightly fur|rowed with parallel lines; but &s;o that the &s;ides in con|tact have their lines always athwart or acro&s;s each other,
<PB N="90" REF="93">
whereas, the lines of the oppo&s;ite &s;ides lie in a &s;imilar po&s;ition. The&s;e dice break away readily from the ore, and are found from one quarter of an inch and le&s;s, to two, but &s;eldom three inches large. I &s;aw &s;ome, the rind of which, or even part of the whole dice, re&s;em|bled a water-pebble. Sometimes &s;treaks of gold-ore are ob&s;ervable on their &s;urface and gold-du&s;t in their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e quartz-&s;ub&s;tances, there is found, in the gold-&s;treaks, topazes of various goodne&s;s and value, either &s;ingle or in clu&s;ters. They are, &s;ometimes, &s;e|veral inches thick in &s;exagonal chry&s;tals, (the points of which are obliquely clipped,) which are either tran&s;pa|rent as water, &s;moke-coloured and more or le&s;s dark. In the engine-&s;haft of the mine of Kljut&s;che&s;skoi, there is &s;aid to lie an enormous ma&s;s of topazes, which could not be got at on account of the water, but I &s;aw &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;herds knocked off with breakers, which appeared very clear and beautiful. They &s;ometimes dig, in the gold-&s;treaks, plenty of water-pebbles, ly|ing in quartz and, &s;ometimes, forming dice, and al&s;o a tin-coloured, radiant, quartz-like &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the gold-&s;treaks there are, in the mines of Bere&s;ofkoi, &s;ome copper, lead and &s;ilver-&s;treaks, which, though divided from the gold-ore, run quite clo&s;e to it. They al&s;o dig, in the&s;e mines, a number of water-pebbles, over&s;hot with an excellent, dark-blue
<PB N="91" REF="94">
lazuli, and al&s;o a remarkable lead-&s;par, which never has been found in any other mine of this or any other country, and of which the ingenious and learned Mr. <HI>Lekmann,</HI> has written a treati&s;e. This &s;par is heavy, demi-tran&s;parent, &s;ometimes vari-coloured, &s;ometimes of a cinnaba-red, and found in great, &s;mall, &s;hort and long chry&s;tals, in the clefts of quartz and al&s;o in the &s;and, &s;tony matrixes, and in places where the &s;pace would allow it, in a flat, cubic, pri&s;matic figure, with unequal truncated, two-&s;ided ends. Sometimes it is found on quartz, in &s;hort, oblique and irregular pyra|mids, like little rubies. If brui&s;ed, it makes a fine, high-yellow fermentation, that may be u&s;ed in minia|ture painting. After all the experiments made in the phy&s;ical laboratory, at Catherineburg, they have ex|tracted from it a rich alloy of lead, amounting to half the &s;ub&s;tance and a very &s;mall quantity of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o found in the&s;e mixt quartz-&s;treaks, wherein this rare mineral is brought forth, &s;ome little oblong chry&s;tals, pointed at both ends, of a &s;ulphur-yellow colour, re&s;embling ma&s;&s;ive &s;ulphur and taken as &s;uch by the miners, but it will not burn in fire nor bur&s;t in flame, like the red lead-&s;par. This little chry&s;talization is found both upon quartz and &s;and-&s;tone.</P>

going. Many more hands are required for &s;electing and &s;eparating the ores, which is done not in the mine, but above, with hammers, and in this work &s;ome thou&s;ands of pea&s;ants are employed, who work for their poll-tax and, according to their age and capacity, earn from three to &s;ix copeeks a day. The&s;e cannot complain again&s;t their ma&s;ter's oppre&s;&s;ive conduct, a great number peri&s;h by the &s;curvy and mo&s;t return home &s;ick and heart-broken. They are only employed when they have no hu&s;bandry to engage them, of cour&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;tance is mo&s;t wanted in &s;ummer-time, when there is mo&s;t work to do. The ore, which is &s;e|parated, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from the &s;ub&s;tance it is connected with, is divided into three &s;orts and &s;ent to the &s;tamp-mills, where it produces from forty pounds to half a pound of pure gold-du&s;t, in every 1000 puds of ore. In the&s;e mines are annually dug 200,000 puds of ore, the be&s;t of which produces a tenth part of the whole, and the three lavatories, or wa&s;hing-hou&s;es, extract annually from five to &s;even puds of pure gold-du&s;t, each pud thirty-&s;ix pounds, Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 26th of June, I returned to Catherineburgh and &s;et out, the next day, for Newjan&s;koi, a di&s;tance of forty-eight miles, to &s;ee the olde&s;t iron-manufactory in all Siberia, and which has been in con&s;tant work &s;ince the year 1701, where there is a wooden church with a &s;tone-built &s;teeple, 189 feet high, with harmo|nious chimes, an old-fa&s;hioned but fine and &s;pacious
<PB N="93" REF="96">
&s;tone-built hou&s;e, with wings in which the proprietor lives, and many other buildings. Near the &s;teeple, &s;tands a great, ca&s;t-iron column, as a monument erect|ed to the founder of the&s;e works. In a circumference of about &s;ix miles, here are 1200 dwellings and only 4000 inhabitants, the chief of them old, faithful &s;er|vants and &s;ub&s;tantial people. Through the &s;treets run little canals, with a number of bridges over them. In the&s;e &s;treets are many &s;hops where all &s;orts of iron and copper-ware are &s;old. Here is a foundery and two high furnaces, one of which is twenty ells high and has four double bellows, and can ca&s;t 700 puds of raw iron in twenty-four hours, which is the large&s;t furnace in the whole Ru&s;&s;ian empire; near it are two hammers, under which the iron-&s;tone is broke and carried, in pails, to the high furnace, where it is wound up into it; a bar-forge, with a hammer, and another where the large in&s;truments, here u&s;ed, are made; a building with two bar-hammers, another with four, two others with three each, an anchor-forge, a water-bellows and three others; a mechanical contrivance to draw out iron between rollers, and plate it; &s;undry large hearths to heat iron, &s;everal tin working places, another bar|forge, where are four bar-hammers, a &s;aw-mill, a corn-mill; a poli&s;hing-mill, where they poli&s;h bells and iron-ware; a hou&s;e where bells are ca&s;t, two build|ings for tinning iron-plates, one where copper-ve&s;&s;els are made, one for forging mine-in&s;truments and tools, and twenty-four forges where all &s;orts of iron-ware is
<PB N="94" REF="97">
made, as kettles, pots, pans, &amp;c. and mo&s;t of the&s;e works are worked by water. It is a delightful &s;ight to &s;ee boys, ten or twelve years old, working with their parents and earning a good &s;alary. There is al&s;o here an old wire-factory, a new place for lock-&s;miths and &s;undry other erections, all &s;urrounded with a fortifica|tion.</P>
<P>This manufactory was founded by <HI>Akimfi Demidovf,</HI> a coun&s;ellor of &s;tate, and remained in that family till it was &s;old to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or <HI>Sawa Jakowlef Sabakin:</HI> it ma|nufactures, annually, 200,000 puds of bar-iron, be&s;ides a va&s;t quantity of all &s;orts of iron-ware. The propri|etor of the&s;e works is the &s;ole proprietor of many others, nearly as capital, in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P><Q>There are many more iron and copper manufacto|ries in this di&s;trict, &s;ome who&s;e works are more ex|ten&s;ive than others, all of which Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> vi&s;ited, but, as they are all upon a &s;imilar plan, it will be tire&s;ome to an Engli&s;h reader to repeat them, and, on this con&s;ideration, we will pa&s;s them over.</Q></P>
<P>At one of the&s;e manufactories, is a kind of beautiful Siberian cedar-trees, or cedar-firs, which have been planted upwards of forty years and are only five inches diameter in their trunk; but have born fruit many years. This year, they bore no fruit, and the pea&s;ants told me, that their bearing is periodical, but I could
<PB N="95" REF="98">
not learn, what this period was; &s;ome &s;aid every fourth or fifth year, others every tenth year, &s;o that I could not credit the a&s;&s;ertion. This tree thrives be&s;t in the pathle&s;s mires of the mountains, and I am of opinion, that it's fruiting depends much on the moi&s;tne&s;s of the weather; for, proceeding farther in the country, I found, that, even in the pre&s;ent barren year, the&s;e trees, in the mo&s;t watry places, bore the mo&s;t fruit, and that it requires two wet years together to make them bear well. Of all inland re&s;in-trees, none, not even the larch, grows &s;o &s;low as the cedar-pine; from hence one would conclude it mu&s;t &s;urpa&s;s every other tree of it's genus in hardne&s;s and &s;olidity of wood, and in beau|ty of growth and appearance. But, notwith&s;tanding this, it is mo&s;t certain, that the wood of the cedar-fir, if compared with that of other firs and larches, is &s;oft and peri&s;hable; but, in appearance, colour, veins and lightne&s;s, it is &s;imilar to the pine and, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be excellent for joiners u&s;e, and there are trunks to be met with in the mountains from which planks might be cut more than two ells in breadth; and I think they would make excellent ma&s;ts. There is no tree that can be imagined of more beautiful growth than the old cedars of this kind, no eye being able to deter|mine the loftine&s;s of their tops. The be&s;t idea of it's growth will be formed, when I &s;ay that, upon a young tree, the trunk of which was five Paris inches and four lines in diameter, I counted &s;ixty rings or marks of annual growth, the diameter of the&s;e of the
<PB N="96" REF="99">
fiifth and &s;ixth year were only one and one-third of a line, and tho&s;e of younger growth, were no more in diameter than the thickne&s;s of a piece of paper four times folded.
<Q>How many years old then mu&s;t &s;uch a tree be and how lofty, who&s;e diameter is more than two ells?</Q>
I &s;aw al&s;o a larch-tree there, only five inches, nine lines in diameter though, by it's rings, it, was fifty-nine years old.</P>
<P>From the manufactory of Newjan&s;koi, we had in &s;ight the abe&s;tos mountain, which I determined to &s;ee. I accordingly rode there during a continual rain and was wet to the &s;kin, it being at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles. It is a long, &s;teep, narrow, rocky tract, ri&s;ing in the middle of a wood, and the number of it's pits and openings made it dangerous to ride on; however I made &s;hift to reach it's &s;ummit, and found it con&s;i&s;ted of a hard, loamy chertz, the layers of which fall into it's depth under an angle of fifty-four degrees, from north to &s;outh, and is chiefly dug up in pieces like a cuboides or trapezoides: within the layer of this hard rock is inter&s;per&s;ed, a great deal of greeni&s;h amianthus, which in the mountain remains firm and indi&s;&s;oluble, but by decompo&s;ition, &s;plits into &s;tiff bri&s;tles. Near this amianthus lies, generally, a fine &s;ilk-like a&s;be&s;tos, (indeed the natives call it, in their language, the &s;ilk-mountain) of a yellowi&s;h-green colour, uncommonly glittering, it's threads running in a perpendicular di|rection. There was formerly a woman, in Newjan&s;koi,
<PB N="97" REF="100">
who had the art of weaving this a&s;be&s;tos into incom|bu&s;table linen and gloves, and al&s;o made paper of it.
<Q>I am told that in India, they make &s;heets of it in which they burn the dead and thus collect the a&s;hes, by unfolding the &s;heet again when cold. Linen made of this mineral, will burn clean in an oven, like to|bacco-pipe clay.</Q>
However hard and difficult it is to dig it, yet it's flexible fibres may be rubbed into a &s;oft and &s;ilken wool, which can be twi&s;ted into a thread and woven by means of oil, and be afterwards cleaned from any oiline&s;s by fire. But as the whole &s;eemed to have no other object in view than to gratify human curio&s;ity, tho&s;e who opened the pits, left off working them and it is &s;carcely exi&s;ting in remembrance.</P>
<P>Before I leave Newjan&s;koi, I mu&s;t not omit to men|tion two manufactories that have rendered this place fa|mous in Siberia, and do honour to the memory of <HI>Demidorf.</HI> One is for the making of frames and wheels, two articles very much &s;old here, and made of field-birch, having no oak in this country. It is indeed curious to the mind of a naturali&s;t and worthy to be remarked how far this field-birch is &s;uperior to fore&s;t-birch, in hardne&s;s and &s;olidity of wood. I weighed a cubical piece of each, exactly of the &s;ame &s;ize, and found the wood of field-birch two &s;eventeenths heavier than that of fore&s;t-birch. Such a difference may be felt with the hand. The wood of the former, when dry, even &s;urpa&s;&s;es the oak. The &s;econd manufactory
<PB N="89" REF="101">
is that of varni&s;hing and japaning copper and iron tea-ve&s;&s;els, wooden bowls, waiters, ctc. This is a very profitable branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. There is &s;ome part of this furniture to be &s;een, which rivals the varni&s;h of the Chine&s;e, and almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;&s;es the French, except in paintings. The method they u&s;e is kept a &s;ecret among the workmen, and they take no apprentices un|le&s;s they are well paid; but I know, from authority, that the whole &s;ecret con&s;i&s;ts in common lin&s;eed-oil, boiled thick and blackened with wood-&s;oot. They let the oil &s;tand &s;ome time in a hot oven, in order to mix it well with the &s;oot, and lay it thin over their work with their fingers; but do this eight or ten times &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, and after every time &s;et it to dry in a hot oven; the finer and thicker the varni&s;h or japaning is wanted, the oftener it is to be done over. In order to put on the ornaments, they cut out flowers, fruits and land&s;capes in paper, lay the&s;e figures on the varni&s;h, cover them with gold-colour, and then with the clear, lin&s;eed oil again, without the &s;oot, &s;everal times, dry|ing the ve&s;&s;el each time as before.</P>
<P>My next vi&s;it was to a tannery, where having no oak, they u&s;e willow-bark and the inner, brown birch-rind; but they prefer the former, and it takes a chord and a half to tan ten hides. I was al&s;o informed that the pure&s;t and mo&s;t odoriferous birch-oil, which is almo&s;t as clear as lin&s;eed-oil, is chiefly u&s;ed to &s;oak the &s;kins: and this oil is drawn from &s;uch pure, white birch-rinds,
<PB N="99" REF="102">
as are taken from old birches, partly rotten at the root, &s;o that there remains little but the outward, oily bark. All the oil burnt from fre&s;h birch-rinds, to which a great deal of the black, bark &s;ub&s;tance adheres, is generally very impure with &s;oot and very unfit for tan|ning. It is a wrong notion to &s;uppo&s;e any wild ro&s;e|mary or other bu&s;h is burnt with the birch to give it a fragrancy; the purer and cleaner the birch-rinds are, the more fragrant will be the oil, without any other ad|dition.</P>
<P>In my way on, I could not but take notice, with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, that the hor&s;es we had with us, being hun|gry and towards night, wherever they met a helle|bore plant, <HI>(Veratrum),</HI> which was not yet in bloom, &s;tooped and eat it greedily. The drivers of our waggons a&s;&s;ured me, that their hor&s;es eat this plant in &s;pring without the lea&s;t hurt, and though it was hurtful to cattle in other places, it had no other effect on theirs, than &s;ometimes to purge them gently. Some country people, fond of chattering, who accompanied us from Newjan&s;koi, made us &s;pend the night very agreeably in di&s;cour&s;ing on the &s;trength and efficacy of wild herbs and plants, one of whom &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon knowledge. He prai&s;ed the Greek vale|rian, <HI>(Polemonium),</HI> as efficacious again&s;t the falling &s;ick|ne&s;s, and called it <HI>Troizwetki,</HI> (three-coloured flower); the &s;age-tree, <HI>(Phlomis tubero&s;a),</HI> as a remedy again&s;t &s;welling of the glands in the groin; the aconite, <HI>(aco|nitum
<PB N="100" REF="103">
lycoctonum),</HI> again&s;t &s;inging or hi&s;&s;ing in the head; the devil's bit, <HI>(Succifa),</HI> which grows very tall, as high as a man's head, and which he called <HI>pupownick,</HI> (navelwort), he &s;aid was a &s;ure remedy in pains of the belly, &s;omnolency and giddine&s;s of head. But his greate&s;t &s;ecrets, this country doctor &s;eemed unwilling to reveal, however, with much per&s;ua&s;ion and a good reward, he communicated the following, which, high|ly ab&s;urd as they are, I will give my readers for their entertainment. The root of the &s;ky-flower, <HI>(Cinera|ria Sibirica),</HI> which grows in all the mar&s;hy woods and con&s;i&s;ts of many thick threads, under which name the mar&s;h-marygold <HI>(Caltha)</HI> is al&s;o known among the country-folks as a dome&s;tic remedy, he declared would bring a man, dead drunk, to him&s;elf and quite &s;ober him, provided he drank no &s;trong liquor the day, he took the medicine, and that he had often tried it. His &s;econd &s;ecret, mo&s;t pernicious to health, is &s;aid to be in u&s;e and fa&s;hion among the common women in Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia; this is to prevent pregnancy, by taking a certain do&s;e of ceru&s;e, or white-lead, which is u&s;ed as a paint, at a time a woman expects her men&s;tru|al cour&s;es, which checks them and de&s;troys concepti|on. It may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, but the effect will certainly cea&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he leaves off this dangerous remedy.</P>
<P>About twenty-eight miles from Newjan&s;koi, I reach|ed, on the 1&s;t of July, the iron-manufactory of In&s;hno
<PB N="101" REF="104">
Tagil&s;koi, where all &s;orts of iron-work are made, by water-mills, al&s;o joinery and turner's work. In this town, there is a beautiful, &s;tone-built church, with a fine cupola and lofty &s;teeple, having a complete ring of bells and harmonious chimes. The whole edifice is covered with iron-plates and divided into a &s;ummer and winter-church, embelli&s;hed with the highe&s;t degree of &s;plendor and a variety of precious ornaments. Among the curio&s;ities of this place are two enormous cubical magnets, which form the altars of each church; the one is five yards high, four and a half broad and almo&s;t as thick; the other &s;even yards high and five yards broad and thick, much penetrated with verdi|grea&s;e. They began to build this church in 1764. Here are al&s;o, a court of Ju&s;tice, a comptoir, a fine, wooden man&s;ion for the proprietor, a foundling ho&s;pi|tal, a drawing-&s;chool, &s;everal neat apartments for the reception of &s;trangers and 1034 hou&s;es. The male inhabitants are 2579, but they are all &s;laves, except 121. Among them are many excellent workmen and the proprietor may boa&s;t, that if there is any manufac|tory well &s;upported with clever people, it is his.</P>
<P>The great ble&s;&s;ing of this manufactory, is a magnet-mountain, within a mile of the place, added to a rich iron-&s;tone &s;oil all round, covered with timber. This mountain was di&s;covered in the year 1702, by the Wogulians, and was opened in 1721. The manufac|tory was e&s;tabli&s;hed here in con&s;equence of it. The
<PB N="102" REF="105">
mountain extends it&s;elf from north to &s;outh, yet is, in the whole, conical, &s;teep and it's perpendicular height about forty fathoms, or 280 feet. It is full of iron-ore, 100 lb. of which yield 60 lb. of fine, pure iron. The magnets which are here found abundantly are chiefly among the meane&s;t iron, about thirty fathoms deep and, in their clefts, over&s;hot with verdigrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The mountain is, at pre&s;ent, divided into three dif|ferent manufactories, tho&s;e of Tagil&s;koi, Newjan&s;koi and Rewdin&s;koi. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ma|nufactory of Tagil&s;koi, it has dug many millions of puds for it's &s;hare, and a great deal from the bottom of the mountain. They continue the works with great regularity in the form of &s;treets, and having taken off the upper ore, the under is ea&s;ily dug, and they em|ploy three or four hundred little boys and girls, who earn three copeeks, or three half-pence a day each, be|&s;ides men. The ore is collected in large heaps, curiou&s;ly underlaid with timber &s;o as to burn, fired and roa&s;ted on the &s;pot. Such a heap will contain 400,000 puds of ore, will often burn forty days and require eight or ten weeks to get cold again. The ore is rendered fluid by this &s;trong burning, and is knocked in pieces with &s;hort-helved hammers. The whole mountain is covered with firs and birches, and at it's mar&s;hy bottom grow young cedars, carefully hedged in.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="106">I left Tagil&s;koi in a delightful, &s;erene night, to vi&s;it other manufactories, that lie more to the northward, down the river Tagil, and pa&s;&s;ed an intrenchment, &s;aid to be thrown up by <HI>Jermak Timofejef,</HI> who is generally known to have been the fir&s;t conqueror of Siberia, and who, after penetrating the country from the T&s;chu&s;|&s;owaja into the Serebrjanka, as far as the brook Kokui, is &s;aid to have erected here winter-tents; but after he had marched over the mountains to the Tagil, halted and threw up this intrenchment, re&s;ting here in order to build new ve&s;&s;els. There, however, is nothing to be &s;een but a rectangular ditch, two fathoms broad, con&s;tructed on an elevated cape, &s;carce five fathoms from the river. It's northern flank is fourteen fathoms long and it's ea&s;tern not much above ten, with two or three caves or &s;ubterranean dwellings within.</P>
<P>A few miles from this is a copper-mine and al&s;o an iron one, and a manufactory e&s;tabli&s;hed near them, now belonging to the crown. The number of hou&s;es is not very great, and the works are performed by pea&s;ants, who labour for their poll-tax. But three neighbouring towns are obliged to &s;end 7,500 people, who are employed in felling of wood, burning of coal, digging, &amp;c. as the manufacturers cannot be &s;pared for &s;uch kind of labour.</P>
<P>Adjoining, is a mountain full of iron-ore, with a &s;ummer-hou&s;e on the top, to which I went on the 3d
<PB N="104" REF="107">
of July, to &s;ee the pro&s;pect, which was exten&s;ive and beautiful, commanding the view of many mountains and the cour&s;e of the Ural, at about fifteen miles di&s;|&s;tance. This mountain produces annually 2,000,000 puds of iron-&s;tone, and yet this quantity is con&s;idered as very trifling.</P>
<P>Of all the Siberian manufactories, Ku&s;chwin&s;koi is the fir&s;t where agriculture has taken place. By the laudable regulations of A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or <HI>Alexey Mo&s;kwin,</HI> the inhabitants, for &s;ome years, have grown their own wheat, and the crops here were very promi&s;ing, not|with&s;tanding the cold, woody and mountainous &s;itua|tion of this di&s;trict. About the Ku&s;chwa, the cedars begin to be very abundant, and the fore&s;ts, on the un|inhabited mountain, full of wild animals. Sables are &s;eldom caught here alive, as the pea&s;ants take them quite young from their ne&s;ts; but there is plenty of boars, hyaenas and wolves. They catch here a great many &s;triped ground-&s;quirrels, which dwell every where throughout the fir, pine and cedar-woods, and chiefly live on the &s;eeds of trees; they climb the trees, but make holes and provi&s;ion-chambers in the ground, in which they lie in winter, carrying thither, by means of the bags in their cheeks, all &s;orts of &s;eeds. Notwith|&s;tanding the beauty of their furs, and they might ea&s;ily be caught by children, they care little about them. This animal is to met with, in &s;ummer-time, in all the re&s;in-woods, from the Kama throughout Siberia, and is a prey to &s;ables and other &s;pecies of wea&s;els.
<PB N="105" REF="108">
During winter, they hide them&s;elves in holes under|ground, live there on the provi&s;ions they collect in &s;um|mer, and though covered with deep &s;now, are never benumbed by the cold or thrown into a torpid &s;tate as the marmottes. The mole is common in this di&s;trict and remarkable for it's uncommon great &s;ize, and, &s;ometimes, for it's &s;nowy whitene&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>The roads in this country are, in &s;ome places, very pa&s;&s;able, in others, almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. Round the manufactories they are kept in repair, and bridges are thrown over the rivers; in other places, they are to be cro&s;&s;ed only by fording, or on rafts. Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> rode chiefly on hor&s;e-back, his baggage following him or meeting him at certain places, &s;ometimes in waggons and &s;ometimes on pack-hor&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>The Siberian plough, which is here u&s;ed and throughout Siberia, is without wheels, like the Ru&s;|&s;ian, and has only a cro&s;s pole with handles, a pair of &s;hafts, within which the hor&s;e walks, and a bent plough-handle fixed before, with a double or &s;ingle coulter. It is a heavy in&s;trument and far from a con|venient one. They u&s;e the Finland harrow as being &s;trong and fit for &s;tony ground. Hu&s;bandmen, in winter, are chiefly employed in hunting &s;ables and martens, with &s;now-&s;hoes and terrier dogs, and commonly &s;hoot them with balls and blunt arrows, from trees. Hunt|ing the &s;able is more difficult than that of the marten,
<PB N="106" REF="109">
which, as &s;oon as pur&s;ued by the hounds, climbs up a tree and is ea&s;ily killed, but the &s;able runs for it and endeavours to deceive his pur&s;uers like a hare and, at la&s;t, when he &s;ees no other refuge, takes to the trees and there meets his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>In my journey I arrived, on the 5th of July, at a place called Jelkina, &s;ettled by Woguls, on both &s;ides of the Tura. The&s;e people neither practi&s;e hu&s;bandry nor breeding of cattle, but live merely by hunting. In other re&s;pects, they perfectly imitate the Ru&s;&s;ians, in their habitations, dre&s;s and way of living, and ra|ther make u&s;e of the Ru&s;&s;ian language than their own; indeed they &s;eem a&s;hamed to &s;peak their mother|tongue before a Ru&s;&s;ian. They have, for many years, been converted to the Greek church, but yet remain very dull and ignorant chri&s;tians. I changed hor&s;es here, (but had &s;ome difficulty to do it, as &s;ome of the inhabitants keep only one hor&s;e between two) and took with me &s;ome guides to &s;hew me the places where they dig ja&s;per and vari-coloured marble. Clo&s;e to this place I was obliged to ford the river I&s;s, called, in Wogul language, <HI>A&s;s,</HI> and &s;oon after having cro&s;&s;ed a lofty mountain, rode through a tract, along the river Tura, where the gra&s;s &s;tood &s;o high as to pa&s;s over the hor&s;e and it's rider. When we reached the marble|quarry, it became dark, but as the &s;pot was dry, I re|&s;olved to &s;pend the night here, which was very &s;erene and, of cour&s;e, we had no covering but the vaulted
<PB N="107" REF="110">
&s;ky: yet, as the night was fro&s;ty and we were expo&s;ed to the wild boars, it was nece&s;&s;ary to light a fire, which our Wogulians did with uncommon agility; not with brim&s;tone, for it's vapour and &s;moke is apt to drive a|way wild animals to a great di&s;tance, and injurious to to the hunter, but they carry with them a handful or two of that &s;oft, faded gra&s;s, which the rivers throw out, dried in their bo&s;om, lay the kindled birch-&s;punk upon it, (which is a kind of fungous that grows on the birch tree and holds fire), and lift it towards the wind, or blow it with their mouth, till it flames. The Ru&s;&s;ians have adopted the &s;ame, and call the gra&s;s <HI>Pui&s;chekcha.</HI></P>
<P>Ri&s;ing in the morning from my airy couch, I con|&s;ulted my guides, and they led me through a mar&s;hy pine-wood, where the trees were &s;o thick and the ground &s;o miry, that our cloaths were torn, our faces &s;cratched and our hor&s;es, every now and then, up to the &s;addle in mire. There was no plant to be &s;een here, except the mountain chickweed, <HI>(Moehringia</HI> and <HI>Linnaea),</HI> which I often cur&s;ed in this di&s;trict, it's bloom being always here a token of mo&s;t impervious mires and impenetrable pine-woods.</P>
<P>In this unplea&s;ant &s;ituation I rode the whole forenoon, and at la&s;t, pa&s;t, with a great deal of trouble, two miry brooks and came into a woody tract, burnt out to the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles &s;quare, where a tempe&s;t, or as
<PB N="108" REF="111">
the Woguls call it, an evil &s;pirit had raged in &s;uch a manner, that it could not have looked more terrible had it been done by an enemy; but the wor&s;t was, that we lo&s;t our path among the felled trees, that laid a|cro&s;s the road, and the &s;wampy mire that &s;carce had a bottom; yet the Woguls tru&s;ted to their geographical knowledge and were convinced they &s;hould find the right path through this wilderne&s;s: Not di&s;po&s;ed to return back, I allighted and led my hor&s;e by the bri|dle, &s;kipping and jumping over the trees, and &s;ome|times up to my knees in mire; but as there was no danger of breaking our necks or bones, we continued wandering through this wood, with axes in our hands, clearing a way before us for a mile and a half. At la&s;t, the courage and &s;trength of my whole retinue of Wo|guls and &s;oldiers left them; this obliged me to halt, and I &s;ent two Woguls on before, to &s;ee whether they could find away out, but they came back frightened at the &s;cream of an owl which they heard, without doing what I ordered them. At la&s;t, they confe&s;&s;ed they had not pa&s;&s;ed through this fore&s;t for many years, and that they were entirely ignorant of it's extent and &s;ituation. Nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, obliged us to go back and we cro&s;&s;ed the Tura, where the water came up to our &s;ad|dles and, at la&s;t, got to a village, quite &s;pent by this miry expedition.</P>
<P>The fore&s;t, along the Tura, has, here and there, &s;ome cedars and a great number of tall larches, where
<PB N="109" REF="112">
I met with the gum of old, burnt trunks, which I have mentioned. On one tree, I found a peculiar kind of gum and on it's rind a &s;ort of turpentine re&s;in, but on all other young wood, I could only meet with the re|&s;in. The Woguls gather this gum and u&s;e it as glue, or chew it on account of it's &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te, as a denti|frice for cleaning and pre&s;erving their teeth. In this, they are like the Greek girls, who chew ma&s;tick for for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next morning I proceeded on my journey and cro&s;&s;|ed the Tura again, and pa&s;&s;ed two little villages. Every one was now bu&s;y making hay, at which the wo|men and girls made a great parade. On account of the flies and gnats, which are very trouble&s;ome, each takes with them a pot full of lighted birch, &s;punks or foul wood, which is rotten like touch-wood, fa&s;tened on a board, in order to prevent their cloaths from catching fire. They prefer the &s;moke of birch-&s;punks in their hou&s;es here, as it drives away the in&s;ects and does not hurt their eyes. Without this &s;moke, there would be no re&s;t in the&s;e woody and northern di&s;tricts. They kindle al&s;o &s;uch things and create a &s;moke in their yards, to which the cattle repair at night, in order to be free from the torture of the flies: as, at this time, it rains almo&s;t every day, and the cut gra&s;s cannot get thoroughly dry on the ground, they do not make it in|to cocks, but in long, &s;mall walls, erected between wooden poles &s;tuck in the ground or run acro&s;s; in &s;uch
<PB N="110" REF="113">
walls the wet hay gets dry pre&s;ently and does not heat. Their &s;cythes are like mo&s;t Siberian ones. Their form is like a long, narrow and bent knife, fa&s;tened on a crooked club, with which the mower, at each &s;tep, cuts to the right and left, by &s;winging the club about in his hands.</P>
<P>Going on, we &s;aw an impending hail-&s;torm before us, and I had ju&s;t time to have a felt-tent rai&s;ed, to &s;ave us from the wet. In our way to another iron-ma|nufactory, we had to pa&s;s &s;uch a wood, as that in which we were lately lo&s;t. The hor&s;es &s;unk, every now and then, up to their brea&s;ts in mire, and though we went very &s;lowly on, were, every moment, in danger of being overthrown or lo&s;ing our eyes by the projecting pine-branches. The proprietor leaves the road in this bad condition for political rea&s;ons, to deprive &s;earch|ers of ore or inqui&s;itive travellers from coming to his mines. Some of the hor&s;e and &s;oot-paths are laid with birch timber and may be rode on with plea&s;ure, and &s;uch-like roads might be made throughout the fore&s;t, at a little expence; but he took care to leave the mo&s;t miry &s;pots, where the mud is almo&s;t bottomle&s;s, with|out any improvement. It is in the&s;e very &s;oft mar&s;hy places that pines, poplars and cedar-firs grow be&s;t and mo&s;t hand&s;ome, particularly where the mine is bottom|le&s;s. In this fore&s;t, I found the &s;purge laurel, <HI>(Daph|ne Mezereum),</HI> the red berries of which are here known by the name of wild pepper. The berries are u&s;ed for
<PB N="111" REF="114">
different purpo&s;es; internally, as an emetick for coughs in children; and, externally, to rub the cheeks with in the bath, which become red, as if inflamed by the &s;harpne&s;s of the juice, &s;o that the lower cla&s;s of women u&s;e it as paint. The kernels of the berries are brui&s;ed and taken, by the pea&s;ants, as a purge; a proof that their inte&s;tines cannot be &s;ound. The root, which is &s;harper than the plant, is u&s;ed as a remedy for the tooth-ach.</P>
<P>Wood-cocks, hares and &s;ables, are here caught by means of traps, called <HI>Slopezi,</HI> which, to break off a tedious narrative, I &s;hall here de&s;cribe. A &s;pot is cho&s;en where the pines do not grow thick, and where two young trees &s;tand at about &s;eventeen feet from each other. From the&s;e trees they cut off all the lower branches. Near one of the&s;e pines a pale or po&s;t, about eight feet high, is driven into the ground. To this they fa&s;ten a pine-pole horizontally, &s;o that one end &s;hall be fixed to one tree and the oppo&s;ite end be|tween the po&s;t and the other tree. Over this pole they fa&s;ten another, as a beam, almo&s;t parallel with it, &s;o loo&s;ely fixed to one tree, at one end, that the other may be moved up and down between the po&s;t and the other tree, which is hewn &s;mooth where the beam falls. This end of the beam is rai&s;ed by a &s;light lifter, &s;up|ported in a notch at the top of the po&s;t and it's end brought down by a piece of ba&s;t, to the lower beam, where it is fa&s;tened, with a wood-cock or a piece of
<PB N="112" REF="115">
meat, by way of bait, &s;o, as that when the bait is moved, the lifter lo&s;es it's hold, and the upper-beam falls down on the &s;able or marten, creeping on the lower-beam and catching at the bait, and thus kills it with it's weight.</P>
<P>Having in&s;pected all the mines and mountains in this di&s;trict, I will now give my readers &s;ome account of the Woguls, who inhabit the fore&s;ts on the northern &s;ide of mount Ural and are &s;ettled about the brook Targa, where I was on the 15th of July, and took up my night's lodging among them. The Woguls inha|bit the&s;e fore&s;ts in &s;ingle families, and each family reckons it's di&s;tance and claims the land of the adjacent neighbourhood as far as they can reach in hunting. Having no other re&s;ource to live on, nece&s;&s;ity keeps them at as a great a di&s;tance from each other as po&s;&s;i|ble, for were they to live together in villages, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y would not be able to find &s;ufficient game for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance. Though mo&s;t of them acquire a hand&s;ome property by catching of &s;ables and other animals, yet they keep no hor&s;es, partly becau&s;e they have no pa&s;|ture for them, are unable to &s;ecure them from the bears and partly becau&s;e they can better pur&s;ue their game in the&s;e pathle&s;s and mar&s;hy fore&s;ts on foot. The riche&s;t among them keep a few cows, which always re|main with the women near the huts, and the&s;e are all the dome&s;tic animals they have, except a few dogs and of the&s;e a very few. Yet nature has a&s;&s;igned them a &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="113" REF="116">
property in the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;ts. The elks are their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Each family of Woguls makes an enclo&s;ure in it's di&s;trict on &s;ome commodi|ous &s;pot, which often extends to a di&s;tance of &s;even, nine or more miles, through the &s;olitary fore&s;t, fenced in with pales made of &s;plit firs and pines. They are very careful of the&s;e enclo&s;ures, and will not &s;uffer any one to make hay, fell wood or take the game within them. At certain di&s;tances, the&s;e enclo&s;ures have openings, provided with pits and &s;pring-bows, that kill the game as &s;oon as the bait is touched, and catch whatever pa&s;&s;es through. It frequently happens, that they catch, in the&s;e pits, female elks and their young ones, and &s;ometimes rein-deer, though &s;uch are very &s;carce in this di&s;trict. Their meat, which they never eat fre&s;h, is cut out into long &s;lices, and dryed without &s;alt, either in &s;moke or in the air. This is their u&s;ual food, which they eat either boiled or dry, out of their hands. Should they have the ill luck not to catch any game for a long time, and &s;hould their provi&s;ion be con|&s;umed, they break the elk-bones, which are laid a&s;ide, boil them in water, and make with them a kind of broth. But they are &s;eldom reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, for, be&s;ides bows and arrows, and guns, with which mo&s;t are provided, they catch wood and water fowl; and tho&s;e that live near a river fi&s;h, with nets and ba&s;kets, and, for this purpo&s;e, make boats of hollow trees, like the Ru&s;&s;ians, or with birch-rinds, in their own way, &s;ewing them together with elk-&s;inews and
<PB N="114" REF="117">
tarring them. They know of no other meat, except cedar-nuts and berries, which grow in the mar&s;hes. Notwith&s;tanding this, they are healthy and have not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of &s;curvy, though living in a &s;wampy and cold, woody climate. They are ignorant of the u&s;e of plants and dome&s;tic remedies; perhaps eating no &s;alt and being accu&s;tomed to the climate, may con|tribute not a little to their health, yet they &s;eldom reach an old age. They are fond of purcha&s;ing from the Ru&s;&s;ians, flour, all &s;orts of things baked and &s;trong liquor. They barter with the Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;kins for cloaths, &s;o that they are entirely ignorant of tanning. They work, indeed, elks claws with their hands and the fat of boiled fi&s;h, till they become &s;oft, and of the&s;e they make gloves. They al&s;o convert the &s;kin of the elk into long &s;now-&s;hoes, or &s;kates, like the Lap|landers, with which they hunt in winter, gluing the wet &s;kin upon them either with larch-tree gum, or &s;ome other glue, prepared by them from rein-deer blood and flour, or elk-horn powder, which, mixed, is to &s;tand one night in a warm oven.</P>
<P>The Woguls are, generally, a &s;hort people, femi|nine and have &s;omething in their faces re&s;embling the Kalmucks, except that their complexions are whiter; their faces are commonly round, and the women, who&s;e favourite pa&s;&s;ion is love, are highly voluptuous. Their hair is generally long, black or dark-brown; few men
<PB N="115" REF="118">
only have a thin, reddi&s;h beard and light-coloured hair.</P>
<P>The womens' dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in white, upper-&s;hifts, made of coar&s;e linen, which reach to the ground, and are tied round the wai&s;t. They hang a cloth, worked with the needle, over their head, hanging down the back, under which is tied, round the forehead, a black frontlet, decorated with beads. Their &s;hoes are made of the bark of trees. Girls go bare-headed, wearing their hair, according to the pre&s;ent Ru&s;&s;ian fa&s;hion, braided into tre&s;&s;es.
<Q>In winter, the women wrap them&s;elves up in &s;kins, like the men.</Q></P>
<P>They have adopted many of the Ru&s;&s;ian manners, even to their dances. Their own con&s;i&s;t in &s;hort moti|ons of their feet &s;et clo&s;e together, and two per&s;ons dancing make little &s;teps to the mu&s;ic in oppo&s;ite cir|cles; &s;o that one turns his back to the other, holding a handkerchief between them, u&s;ing impa&s;&s;ioned ge&s;|tures and expre&s;&s;ive movements. The mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment they u&s;e for this purpo&s;e, is a kind of harp, in form of a little boat, called, by them, <HI>Schongourt,</HI> &s;trung with &s;ix gut-&s;trings, twi&s;ted at one end round a piece of cro&s;s wood, and tuned by other little &s;lips of wood. The player takes this in&s;trument on his knee, beats the ba&s;e with his left-hand, and the treble with his right. Their melody is &s;imple but harmoni|ous, and in the Tartarian ta&s;te. The Woguls are of
<PB N="116" REF="119">
Finni&s;h origin and their language, as far as I could &s;ee by a dictionary made therefrom, is &s;imilar to that of Finland. But they have many different dialects among them, and even the pronunciation, with many of the expre&s;&s;ions of the Woguls, in the environs of the So&s;wa, are already di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of the Woguls about the Tura.</P>
<P>The winter-huts of this people, are &s;quare and made of timber, with a flat roof, in which they make an open|ing to let in the light, with a door-way to the north or ea&s;t. On the left from the door, in the middle of the &s;ide-wall, &s;tands a low oven and near it a chimney, over which the &s;moke goes out and the light comes in. Oppo&s;ite the oven is a broad bench for &s;leeping on, and again&s;t the &s;outh-wall a bench to &s;it on. They have, commonly, a little ve&s;tibule to this hut, in which &s;tands all &s;orts of hou&s;hold furniture and ve&s;&s;els; the&s;e con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of troughs, and barrels of hollowed birch-trunks or birch-bark, which they u&s;e for a hun|dred little nece&s;&s;aries. Of the birch-bark, they make drinking and eating-ve&s;&s;els, and the women make ob|long cradles of it, which are little more than boxes, and &s;u&s;pend their children in them, within the hut, or car|ry them on their backs. Of the upper, fine, birch-bark they make &s;mart, little boxes, by boiling and clean&s;ing it, &s;ewing the parts together with &s;inews and embel|li&s;hing them with fine &s;havings of wood, and in the&s;e they keep their needle-work. In &s;ummer-time, they

are &s;eldom to be found in the&s;e habitations, but live in open huts, marde of birch-bark, <HI>(Balagani),</HI> before which they keep a continual fire, to keep off the flies and hor&s;e-&s;tingers, which are almo&s;t in&s;upportable in the&s;e di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>'Some authors,' &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>pretend that the&s;e Woguls are the brethren of the pre&s;ent Hungarians, and found their conjecture on the &s;ituation of the Wogul territory and the &s;triking re&s;emblance there is between the language of the two nations. This peo|ple was &s;ubjected to the dominion of Ru&s;&s;ia at the &s;ame time with Siberia.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Woguls, Chri&s;tians as well as Pagans, pur|cha&s;e their wives, and the latter have often two at a time. A tolerably hand&s;ome one may be bought for the value of five rubles, and tho&s;e who cannot afford this, endeavour to &s;teal a wife. Marriage takes place without any ceremony, the young man pays the price, takes the girl to his hut and goes to bed to her, and the next day &s;he is his wife. A lying-in woman is held to be impure for the fir&s;t &s;ix weeks, all which time &s;he remains alone. The fir&s;t comer gives a name to the new-born child, without any other cere|mony.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their burial-places are in the woods. They dre&s;s the decea&s;ed, put him between four boards and lay
<PB N="118" REF="122">
him with his head to the north. The grave they call <HI>Vanka,</HI> and in it they lay a bow, arrows and other implements, without any other form.</Q></P>
<P>I could obtain no accurate or po&s;itive account re|&s;pecting their ancient, religious opinions, becau&s;e they ob&s;tinately deny the &s;uper&s;titions wherewith they are &s;till infected, and call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. It is cer|tain, however, that they &s;till per&s;i&s;t in their ancient idolatry, wor&s;hiping &s;everal idols, and particularly for the &s;ake of hunting. It is &s;aid that they call on dif|ferent idols for elk-hunting, &s;able-hunting, &amp;c. and even bring offerings to the images of the&s;e animals. There is an elk-calf, <HI>(Wolenn),</HI> roughly carved in &s;tone, near the habitation of the rich Wogul Deni&s;ch|kin, upon the So&s;wa, of which they relate many ficti|tious &s;tories, about it's being petrified. Over it they have built a hut, to which the Woguls repair from the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts, in order to obtain a lucky hunting-day, by their prayers and little offerings. They have, al&s;o, idols of human &s;hape; &s;ome of them are carved in wood and have &s;hot or coral-beads in&s;tead of eyes. About a year &s;ince, &s;ome ore-&s;earchers found, in a tract of wood, between the So&s;wa and the Lo&s;wa, on a high pine, a ca&s;t, brazen image of a human form, with a hunting lance, and this certainly was a Wogul idol. Before they were converted, they u&s;ed to place their idols on &s;teep, rock-walls, in rock-caverns or on high pines, that their wor&s;hip might excite a &s;acred awe.
<PB N="119" REF="123">
Near the Lo&s;wa, ju&s;t above the brook Scha&iuml;tanka, is a cavern, in a chalk-mountain, renowned, to this day, for being a temple or &s;anctuary of the Woguls. Se|veral bones of victims and &s;ometimes little images, copper-rings with carved figures, &amp;c. have been found in it, which the Woguls purcha&s;e from the Ru&s;&s;ians, and &s;ecretly adore as idols. Numberle&s;s brooks, mountains and places are called, in this part of Siberia, <HI>Scha&iuml;tanka,</HI> or <HI>Icha&iuml;tan&s;kaja,</HI> becau&s;e the Woguls held there, their idolatrous wor&s;hip and their idols, and are called indi&s;criminately, by the Ru&s;s inhabitants, <HI>Scha|&iuml;tan,</HI> or the Devil.</P>
<P><HI>'Torim,'</HI> &s;ays <HI>Tooke,</HI>
<Q>is a divinity, under who&s;e &s;ymbol they convey the idea of a univer&s;al god, the merciful Sovereign of the world. They have divers deities inferior to him and in &s;ubordination, and di&s;|tingui&s;h them by various names. The &s;un they con|ceive to be the abode of Torim; but that orb it&s;elf is, with them, a divinity, as is the moon, the clouds and principal phaenomena of nature. The Devil, whom they call <HI>Koul,</HI> is, with them, of very little con&s;equence; they con&s;ider him as a contemptible being, and &s;carce be&s;tow a thought on him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The chief fe&s;tival of the Woguls is called <HI>Yelbola,</HI> and held at the commencement of the year, which is at Ea&s;ter, and the fea&s;t is &s;aid to be that at which God de&s;cends upon the earth, by which they mean
<PB N="120" REF="124">
the return of &s;pring. Another fe&s;tival is <HI>Cenkobo;</HI> celebrated on the &s;econd new moon after Yelbola. At the&s;e fe&s;tivals, they &s;acrifice victims, either a hor&s;e, cow, &s;heep, goat, or wild-fowl. Sacrifices for the &s;ick, everyone performs at home.</Q></P>
<P>On the 22d of July I vi&s;ited another magnet moun|tain, that which lies near the river I&s;s. The magnets here are mixed with grey blinde, and are often found of many puds weight. I &s;aw magnets of &s;even pounds that would lift and bear above thirty-&s;ix pounds weight; &s;mall magnets that would rai&s;e twenty or twenty-five times their own weight, have been found here.</P>
<P>On my return to Newjan&s;koi, and not far from that manufactory, I met again with that beautiful red-lead &s;par, which I &s;aw in the gold-mines, and which has never been &s;een in any other corner of the world; and had now an opportunity of finding out the quantity of lead it contained. I made an a&s;&s;ay and found that 100 lb. would produce about forty-three pounds of lead and about one grain of &s;ilver; whereas the raw clay, from which the &s;par was dug, yielded but &s;ix pounds of lead per cwt.</P>

This is a fort
<PB N="121" REF="125">
lying on the left of the river Ui, which &s;prings from the Ural, not far from the &s;ources of the Jaik. The Uwelka unites with the Ui, about three quarters of a mile from the fort, and is much broader than the lat|ter, which here does not exceed &s;even or eight fathoms. This place, where the chief officers and men of the line re&s;ide, is pretty enough; it is built in a &s;quare form, with ba&s;tions in the angles of it's wooden wall and rave|lins, al&s;o four towers with gafes upon the flanks, be&s;ides a ditch, chevaux-de-frize and competent ordnance. Of public buildings there is a fine &s;tone-built church, a wooden church, a man&s;ion for the general, and &s;undry pretty buildings, in which the &s;everal officers live. The re&s;t of the hou&s;es are not in good condition, ex|cept that of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-director and &s;ome new dwellings belonging to merchants. All the hou&s;es, which amount to &s;ome hundreds, are built in regular &s;treets and the name of each &s;treet wrote on the corner, in black tablets. Here is a bridge over the Ui, who&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;ide, belonging to the Kirgue&s;e, has a well-built market, where trade flouri&s;hes with the A&s;iaticks. It is an exten&s;ive &s;quare, built of wood, divided into a piazza and Bucharian market-place, on the left; an|other on the right, for the natives, and a large place, encompa&s;&s;ed with great booths, for the trade of the Kirgue&s;e, be&s;ides &s;ome ba&s;tions and a wooden watch-tower, which commands a view over the Kirgui&s;ian &s;tep. It is al&s;o fortified with chevaux-de-frize and on three &s;ides, from the river, &s;urrounded with ditches.
<PB N="122" REF="126">
About the river are inns, built with wood, and eating-hou&s;es, for the trading people and merchants.</P>
<P>I can &s;ay little about the trade here, which has been reckoned more exten&s;ive and advantageous than that of Orenburg, there having, for a year pa&s;t, been a mi&s;|under&s;tanding between the whole horde of the Kir|gue&s;e, who inhabit the neighbouring &s;tep, and come here to trade; which mi&s;under&s;tanding has not only e&s;tranged them from the&s;e boundaries, but al&s;o deter|mined them to render the road of the A&s;iatic cara|vans, to this place, un&s;afe; and it is but a few weeks &s;ince they &s;ent a detatchment of regular light-hor&s;e in|to the &s;tep, which went a great way without getting a &s;ight of a &s;ingle Kirgui&s;ian; &s;o that a reconciliation with this people is not &s;oon to be expected.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay here, the chief of the horde, called <HI>Ablai Sultan,</HI> &s;ent &s;ome deputies, but their propo&s;als and preten&s;ions were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as not to be granted. Here is a &s;trong garri&s;on of Ba&s;kirians, and a report of warlike preparations has made the Kirgui&s;ian warriors &s;o &s;hy, that there is none to be &s;een in the whole &s;tep, as far as the mountains. This has been confirmed by merchants who travelled from thence, and who were &s;o lucky as not to meet a &s;ingle Kirgui&s;ian: but an|other caravan arriving &s;oon after, had not the &s;ame good fortune, but was &s;topped and detained by the Kirgue&s;e till late in autumn.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="127">As far as I could learn, mo&s;t of the caravans come here from Ta&s;chkent. There are but few Bucharians, and tho&s;e of Chewinzka are &s;eldom to be met with. The goods, brought by the caravans, are &s;pun and new cotton, coar&s;e and fine cotton-&s;tuff, callico of dif|ferent qualities, of which that of Ta&s;chkent is the be&s;t; they &s;eldom bring India ones. Cotton and &s;ilk-girdles, printed cotton-curtains, table-cloths and &s;hirts; a kind of bad velvet, curled and &s;triped lamb-&s;kins; Turkey worm-&s;eed and dried fruits; al&s;o Chine&s;e &s;ilver and Bucharian, or Per&s;ian, gold-coins. The goods they carry back, are red and &s;carlet cloths, foreign velvet, camblets manufactured about the Jaik, all &s;orts of light furs of different goodne&s;s, furs of the Wolga-mu&s;k &s;ewed together, otter and beaver-furs for trimmings, Ru&s;&s;ian-hides, black and red; of &s;mall wares, iron-locks, needles, vari-coloured gla&s;s-beads, loaves of &s;ugar, paper, and colours, as, allum, vitriol, cochi|neal, brazil, indigo, orpiment, ceru&s;e, common pa|per, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The trade here, with the A&s;iatic merchants is, in general, le&s;s than at Orenburg, and the goods brought here are of le&s;s value; but the barter-trade with the Kirgui&s;ian Co&s;&s;acks of the middle horde, is far greater and of more con&s;equence. The&s;e latter are not &s;o much ver&s;ed in trade as the Kirgue&s;e of the little horde, who trade at Orenburg; their hor&s;es and the re&s;t of their cattle are better, and the merchants here e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="124" REF="128">
gain on both &s;ides; and add to this, that all Kirgui&s;ian cattle are cheaper at Troizkoi than at Oren|burg. Oxen are more plentiful in this horde and, therefore, bought here in great numbers, and there are large and hand&s;ome bullocks among them. Hor&s;es here are larger and &s;tronger, but as wild and untamed as tho&s;e of the little horde. Sheep and goats are of the &s;ame form and nature; be&s;ides the&s;e the Kirgue&s;e bring furs of wolves, red foxes, &s;tep-foxes and little ground-foxes; lamb, &s;heep and oxen &s;kins, coar&s;e camels-hair, colt-&s;kins, hair-lines, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In order to give the reader &s;ome idea of the luxury of the&s;e A&s;iatic nomades and to &s;hew their wants, I will add here a li&s;t of all wares and toys, which the merchants of this realm barter with them, at a great price, and for which they receive cattle, furs, and Chine&s;e &s;ilver, which the Kirgue&s;e get by their cattle-trade. The&s;e goods are, &s;carlet and red cloths, from the fine&s;t &s;ort to the &s;oldier's coat, camblets manufac|tured in the country about the Jaik, calimancoes, white and parti-coloured &s;tuffs; napkin-cloth, Chine&s;e cot|ton-&s;tuffs, nankeen, Chine&s;e and foreign velvets, old and new furs covered with &s;ilk and half-&s;ilk &s;tuffs; good fox, otter and beaver-furs, for bordering of caps; thin &s;ilk cloaths, &s;triped and figured linens for cloaths; cotton and &s;ilk-girdles of A&s;trachan; hides and cordo|vans; all &s;orts of female ornaments; tre&s;&s;es, ta&s;&s;els, fringes, brea&s;t-pendants, turned and poli&s;hed gla&s;s-beads;
<PB N="125" REF="129">
pearls, a kind of &s;nail-&s;hells, called <HI>Serpent-heads;</HI> looking-gla&s;&s;es, combs, razors, needles, &s;ilk-yarn and &s;ilk-thread; ceru&s;e, rouge; all &s;orts of iron-wares, as ca&s;t and hammered boilers, ladles, trevets, chains, hor&s;e-harne&s;s, locks, pad-locks, iron-traps, axes, knives of all &s;orts, &s;izars, fire-&s;teels; buckles, iron, copper and tin-buttons; funnels, needle-ca&s;es, &s;nuff-boxes, pipes, tobacco, horn-ca&s;es; al&s;o copper and tin-ware, raw and in plates; iron-wire, tin-ve&s;&s;els, varni&s;hed and common cups; little trunks, with iron-bands; carts and waggons; materials for dying, as al|lum, vitriol, red-wax, &s;ealing-wax, pitch; groats, rye-bread and wheat, common tea, hay, &amp;c. All the&s;e articles being mo&s;tly inland goods, are &s;old at a con&s;i|derable price to the Kirgue&s;e, and make a commer|cial intercour&s;e with that nation very important.</P>
<P>It being well authenticated that the adjacent di&s;tricts of the &s;tep were free from Kirgue&s;e, I would not neg|lect the opportunity of viewing &s;ome remarkable places there; I therefore went, on the 17th of Augu&s;t, to a Ko&s;chena, or Tartarian temple, kept &s;acred both by the Kirgue&s;e and Ba&s;kirians, and &s;ituated in the mid|dle of the de&s;art, upon a little river which flows into the Ui, about &s;eventy-five miles from this place. My e&s;cort con&s;i&s;ted of twenty Co&s;&s;acks, from the di&s;trict of the river Ui, and eighty Ba&s;kirians, Me&s;t&s;cheraks and Tartars, with the Ba&s;kirian Starchin Schoker. Hav|ing travelled unmole&s;ted the whole day, I ordered my
<PB N="126" REF="130">
tent to be erected in the evening, and &s;lept quietly on the &s;tep. The night was gloomy, yet without dew, and the next morning was fine and &s;erene. The day after, we reached the Tartarian temple, to &s;ee which, I undertook the journey. It &s;tands on an elevated, open, level ground, in perfect good condition, and the wooden-work, within &s;hews, that it is not &s;o very anci|ent as reported; yet there is no Ba&s;kirian or Kirgue&s;e that remembers it's being erected. Round about it, is a circular ditch, 100 fathoms in circumference, which, on account of the &s;andy &s;oil, is not very deep. With|in this ditch is the place where the Kirgue&s;e, if in the neighbourhood, bury their dead.</P>
<P>The lower part of the building, of which I have given a repre&s;entation, is &s;quare, thirteen Ru&s;&s;ian ells in breadth and &s;eventeen in length: the front and en|trance are towards the &s;outh, and rai&s;ed above the lower part by a wall of two ells and a half; the three other &s;ides are ornamented with a cornice, con&s;i&s;ting of nine rows of out&s;tanding bricks, of which the three middle ones turn their angles outwards. On the whole front, runs a cham&s;ret, as an ornament, and two others on both &s;ides of the porch. This porch is of Gothic con|&s;truction. It is three ells and three-quarters wide, and rather more than &s;even ells high. Within, on both &s;ides, there are arched niches, four ells high and two and a half broad and deep, in each of which is a little, &s;quare air-hole through the wall. The inner-door is
<PB N="127" REF="131">
al&s;o arched, but the in&s;ide of the arch is filled up with a thin wall, re&s;ting on a cro&s;s-beam, of cour&s;e, the height of the gate, from the &s;ill to the cro&s;s-beam, is but three ells and a half, and the breadth, &s;even-fourths. As the bottom or floor of the building with|in is &s;omewhat rai&s;ed, there are a couple of brick-&s;teps before it, and on the upper-&s;tep lies a &s;ill of fir|wood, not in the lea&s;t decayed, but worn in pa&s;&s;ing in and out. The chapel within is ju&s;t nine ells &s;quare and the walls are two ells thick; the roof, within, is vaulted, flat in the middle and built in a workman-like manner, and the centre of the roof is ornamented with a ball of argill and white earth; the angles of the roof are rounded off and decorated with bricks, placed in in the form of &s;cales and &s;upported by pila&s;ters; in the middle of each &s;ide, within, are niches and a circular place left in the centre of each niche, half way through the wall. To give light to this chapel, there are, in the we&s;t-&s;ide, &s;ome window-holes; underneath the windows, within, all round the building, is a hollow cornice, where it is evident lights were burnt, and wherein are three air-holes in the &s;outhern wall, and two in the &s;ide-walls. In the corner are &s;ome blind holes, the u&s;e of which I could not conceive. Near the floor is another hollow cornice all round, which renders the walls thinner in the&s;e places, and, at the bottom, &s;eems as if it had been gnawn and &s;ome &s;tones fallen out in &s;undry places. Above this &s;quare build|ing, which is eight ells and a half high, &s;tands, not di|rectly
<PB N="128" REF="132">
over the centre but &s;treight over the arch, a fun|nel, re&s;embling a twelve-angled cupola, on a perpen|dicular brick-work, five ells and a half high, with a plain cornice round it. The cupola is eight ells high, open above, within which are many cro&s;s-beams, &s;o that a per&s;on may climb up to the top, and that it may more ea&s;ily be done, there is a birch-trunk within, with &s;hort cut branches, &s;erving as a ladder.</P>
<P>The whole building con&s;i&s;ts of red-bricks, &s;imilar in &s;hape and form to European ones. The &s;tones, of the in&s;ide floor, are &s;quare and of a cubic form, and laid in mortar, which &s;eem quite fre&s;h; the roof only is thinly overgrown with mo&s;s.</P>
<P>Within the porch, are birch-poles leaned on both &s;ides, hung and covered with tufts of hor&s;es hair, manes and tails, and &s;ome rags of &s;ilk-cotton. The Kirgue&s;e be|lieve it &s;alutary to their hor&s;es, if &s;ome of their tails and manes is left in &s;uch a &s;acred place, and it is generally a Tartarian cu&s;tom, when pa&s;&s;ing before &s;uch holy places, to leave &s;omething of what they have with them. Within the porch al&s;o, in part of the wall, we found all &s;orts of little &s;tones, &s;ome lead balls, an ar|row, gun-powder, &amp;c. Some of the Tartars of my e&s;cort, having &s;aid their prayers, made an addition to the&s;e things, among which were a few &s;mall copper-coins. Probably the blind angle-holes within were de&s;igned for the depo&s;it of &s;uch little offerings.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="133">Within the ditch was a variety of old and new graves, clo&s;e together. The old ones, on account of the &s;andy &s;oil, were almo&s;t fallen in, and it was clear that they were ca&s;ed to a con&s;iderable depth, with birch-pales and wood covered with little boards. At every grave, at the north or head-end was &s;tuck, upright, a birch-pole, &s;even feet high, or one or two wooden lances, with rib|bands or rags tied on the top, by way of flag; and the latter is &s;aid to be peculiar to the graves of men. On &s;ome, the turf was beaten &s;mooth and covered with mats of thin reed-gra&s;s, &s;ewed together. About many were &s;ome old latticed-work of their felt tents, which encompa&s;&s;ed the grave like a hedge. Upon &s;ome, lay old &s;addles, wooden bowls, ladles, &amp;c. One was co|vered with a frame, on which they weave narrow pieces of camblets; on many was a wooden &s;pade, with the handle &s;tuck in the earth, and about mo&s;t were twi&s;|ted, round the trellis or enclo&s;ures, long girdles or ropes of hor&s;e or camels hair. On one grave, lay a kind of coffin, in form of a little boat, and turned on it's flat cover, but it's &s;ize &s;hews it would have held only a child. On one, was placed part of a cart of Kara-Kalpak&s;koi, with it's two wheels &s;even feet high, which, perhaps, was u&s;ed in carrying the body. This appear|ed to be one of the hand&s;ome&s;t graves, or tombs. Round the temple, grew a great deal of kali, and I re|mark this, becau&s;e I &s;aw it no where el&s;e afterwards, either in the&s;e di&s;tricts or tho&s;e of the Samara or Ir|ti&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="134">My drawing and de&s;cription was not &s;o &s;oon fini&s;hed as the prayer of the Ba&s;kirians who accompanied me. I &s;ee out on my return at five o'clock, encamped on the road and reached Troizkaja the next night, without any di&s;a&s;ter, but that of our hor&s;es being almo&s;t knocked up.</P>
<P>On the 23d. of Augu&s;t, I &s;et out from Troizkaja to trace the river Ui, up to the Uralian mountains, and in my way, towards night, was obliged to &s;leep at a guard-&s;tation, owing to a ri&s;ing thunder-&s;torm in view. Scarce had I arrived, but &s;uch a dreadful &s;torm broke out, as I had never &s;een in any country I had pa&s;&s;ed through. It la&s;ted three full hours, and during all this time, one could &s;carce count &s;ix &s;econds and generally but two or three, without &s;eeing the mo&s;t fiery fla&s;hes of lightning and hearing the mo&s;t tremendous roars of thunder. The thunder-cloud had formed in the we&s;|tern &s;ky, a broad, dark girdle, which &s;tood immove|able, and underneath this cloud it fla&s;hed without inter|ruption; at la&s;t, a violent &s;hower followed, and the next day was warm and &s;erene again, except a few wan|dering thunder-clouds.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e forts was attacked this &s;ummer by 1000 Kirgui&s;ian robbers, who had hidden them&s;elves in the neighbouring pine-wood, and during a blind attack upon this &s;mall garri&s;on, carried off from the &s;tep all the hor&s;es belonging to the fort, that were there feed|ing,
<PB N="131" REF="135">
and the centinels with them, who were placed to watch the hor&s;es; &s;ome of whom were killed on the fir&s;t on&s;et, and the garri&s;on, then deprived of hor&s;es, was unable to pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>But this was a trifling di&s;a&s;ter to the air-plague, which raged here in the neighbourhood at this time, and might, perhaps, be owing to the &s;ituation of the place, the mora&s;&s;es of a mountainous di&s;trict, expo&s;ed to the burning heat of the &s;un. It was with difficulty my hor&s;es could gain admittance into the fort, an edict having been i&s;&s;ued by the commanding-officer, that no &s;trange cattle &s;hould be admitted into an infected place. But my opinion was, that it was proper to admit them and not &s;uffer them to be expo&s;ed on the ground, which was the &s;ource of the di&s;order. I &s;hall here dwell a lit|tle on the nature of this di&s;temper, which makes a great ravage in this di&s;trict, in moi&s;t and hot &s;ummers, where there are open &s;teps or de&s;arts, with numberle&s;s, fre&s;h, bitter and &s;alt-water lakes, and annually along the Siberian line, by de&s;troying a number of regimental hor&s;es, there quartered.</P>
<P><Q>A de&s;cription of this plague may be thought u&s;e|le&s;s to an Engli&s;h reader, but when it is con&s;idered, that the &s;ame cau&s;e may operate in this and other countries, a little enquiry into it may not be unac|ceptable.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136">Notwith&s;tanding all the pains I took to be an eye|witne&s;s of the effects of this plague, I could not get an opportunity to open a fallen hor&s;e, and examine into it as I could wi&s;h. The plague had raged during the hot &s;ummer-months, e&s;pecially when the &s;ultry &s;outh-winds blew, but as &s;oon as contrary winds &s;ucceeded, the evil relaxed; but if the&s;e contrary winds do not con|tinue, the di&s;order rages as before, and will even attack tho&s;e men, who, in the&s;e di&s;tricts, are more or le&s;s ex|po&s;ed to it. But this evil &s;eldom &s;hews it&s;elf in towns or forts, either on men or cattle. The former com|monly feel it in the field, or when they go into the country, hay-making, attending their herds, &amp;c. e&s;|pecially where the di&s;trict is &s;wampy. It has been ob|&s;erved by a detachment lately in the Kirgui&s;ian &s;tep, and al&s;o upon many other occa&s;ions, that there are cer|tain low grounds, in which this di&s;temper is generally to be met with. When this detachment had pa&s;&s;ed the night on &s;uch places, it commonly happened, that not only many hor&s;es fell the next day, but that the in|fection &s;pread it&s;elf to men. All the&s;e are very &s;trong proofs of what I heard in other places, during the win|ter, of a &s;imilar plague, that u&s;ed to &s;hew it&s;elf in ma|lignant tumours. I even know that a gangrenous in|flammation of the throat, about the river Irti&s;h, has been con&s;idered as the &s;ame plague as that which raged here. From the above circum&s;tances and other &s;ymp|toms of the di&s;order, it &s;eems plain, that it's principal cau&s;e is certain in&s;ects hovering in the air, and almo&s;t
<PB N="133" REF="137">
invi&s;ible to the eye. Add to this, that it &s;eizes men, hor&s;es and cows, who&s;e &s;kin is not much &s;heltered from their attacks; whereas &s;heep, who&s;e bodies are defended by their wool, never &s;uffer in this calamity, let it rage ever &s;o violently; and al&s;o, that cooler &s;pots are quite free from this evil, at a time when it is prevalent in others. About the Irti&s;h, there &s;eldom a year pa&s;&s;es with|out this plague, but near the water Burla, &s;ituated only &s;eventy-five miles from the Irti&s;h, where the air is al|ways cool, this &s;courge to men and bea&s;ts is unknown. Here the inhabitants drive all the cattle they can &s;pare, from the forts and &s;tations, to feed during the unwhole|&s;ome &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I will now de&s;cribe the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;order in men. The fir&s;t is, that the &s;ounde&s;t and mo&s;t healthy per&s;ons, of any age or &s;ex, are &s;uddenly troubled with an itching, followed by a hard tumour in &s;ome particu|lar part, which &s;eems to ari&s;e from the &s;ting of a fly, or hor&s;e-&s;tinger. This &s;welling breaks out in the co|vered or uncovered parts of the people, but generally in the face, and, among hor&s;es, in the groin and ab|domen. It rapidly increa&s;es in &s;ize and hardne&s;s, and grows &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, that one may prick the &s;woln part with a needle, till we reach the &s;ound fle&s;h under it, and the patient not feel it. In the centre of this hard tu|mour is commonly di&s;covered, in the external part, a red or blui&s;h point, &s;imilar to the &s;ting of an in&s;ect, and if remedies are not applied, the gangrenous putri|dity
<PB N="134" REF="138">
will extend it&s;elf farther. During this fir&s;t &s;tage of the evil, the patient feels no internal indi&s;po&s;ition, but with the increa&s;e of the boil, he is afflicted with head-achs, anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which are, perhaps, but the natural con&s;equences of his fear of danger; though the &s;ame anxiety, even to &s;adne&s;s, is vi&s;ible in cattle, but not till the di&s;temper has reached it's high|e&s;t degree and &s;eems incurable. Some pea&s;ants, who accompanied me and had been afflicted with this di&s;|ea&s;e, told me, that, after the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms had &s;hewn them&s;elves, whenever they rode through a brook or within &s;ight of water, they felt them&s;elves very faint, feeble and ready to &s;woon.</P>
<P>Cattle generally die of this di&s;temper, partly becau&s;e the boil is di&s;covered too late, and partly becau&s;e the common people do not like to meddle with the cows; but men pre&s;ently get free from it, as &s;oon as proper remedies are applied. Dr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> has, in his Siberian travels, de&s;cribed the method of curing it. The com|mon people, after pricking the hard &s;welling in &s;everal places with a long needle, rub into it a mixture of &s;al ammoniac and tobacco, enjoining the patient not to drink any thing cold and to refrain from certain food. About the Irti&s;h, they prick the tumour and bathe it with a &s;trong lye of wormwood-a&s;hes, and a decoction of tobacco and &s;al ammoniac, or allum. On the line of the river Ui, infallible cures are &s;aid to be performed by a hot application of night-&s;hade, reduced to pow|der,
<PB N="135" REF="139">
&s;al ammoniac, levain and oatmeal. Yet the ge|nerality of the lower-cla&s;s of people, prefer rather the old, painful remedy, and even &s;urgeons have adopted it. In &s;ome places, they apply a living frog to the part, but I cannot &s;ay with what &s;ucce&s;s. The remedies I have mentioned, often &s;ucce&s;sfully applied to hor&s;es, are of &s;uch a nature, that they will kill any &s;pecies of in&s;ect, and corroborates my opinion of their being &s;ome venemous in&s;ect, which, during the &s;ultry &s;um|mer days, ri&s;es in the air of certain, &s;wampy &s;pots and finds it's way into the &s;kins of animals, thus cau&s;ing that dangerous, gangrenous and deadly &s;welling. Perhaps this is an in&s;ect &s;imilar to that ob&s;erved by Swedi&s;h naturali&s;ts, and which <HI>Linnaeus</HI> calls <HI>furia infer|nalis,</HI> or the helli&s;h fury, of which we have had but very few accounts; but it is not, probably, of the &s;ame &s;pecies, it having been remarked in Sweden, that this in&s;ect cau&s;es a much more rapid and mo&s;t torturing death, <NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Linnaeus Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI> Edit. 12. Vol. II. p. 1325.</NOTE> whil&s;t this of Siberia operates &s;lowly and almo&s;t without pain; but the experiment may be tried, which was &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed in Sweden, whether an ap|plication of turned milk, or fre&s;h, white chee&s;e, would not extract the in&s;ect from the infected part. In &s;uch di&s;orders, it would be of great u&s;e to keep the cat|tle all together, in a particular pa&s;ture, and make a
<PB N="136" REF="140">
great &s;moke round them, all the time the plague rages, with every &s;ort of roots, dried turf and dung; which would, in all likelihood, keep off the in&s;ects from troubling them.</P>
<P><Q>This country, as far as Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> has hitherto travelled, &s;eems to be inhabited only by nomade na|tions, except at the &s;orts and manufactories. The old boundary of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, before it's terri|tory was extended as it is, was fortified by a line of redoubts, and properly garri&s;oned to keep the Tar|tar nations from encroachments. The&s;e garri&s;ons are &s;till kept up, and he travelled from one to the other, making excur&s;ions from each, on both &s;ides the line, where he could hear of any thing worth his in&s;pecti|on. It appears that the roads, from place to place, are beaten and, in &s;ummer-time, tolerably pa&s;&s;ible; near the forts and manufactories, they are kept in &s;ome degree of repair, and where there is no perma|nent, Tartarian village, and the di&s;tance is too great between fort and fort, po&s;t-hou&s;es, for the accommo|dation of travellers, have been erected, where hor&s;es are kept in readine&s;s for their u&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the 26th of Augu&s;t to the middle of Decem|ber, 1770, he was detained, by an inflammation of his eyes and &s;welling of the eye-lids, occa&s;ioned by the burning heat of the &s;un and the &s;alt du&s;t, during his journey through the &s;tep or de&s;art of Troizkaja;

but, having &s;ome young gentlemen with him, who &s;tudied under him, he &s;ent one to explore the country in the neighbourhood and another to take an account of the fi&s;heries in the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. The one was em|ployed in &s;earching the depth of caverns, which are not of &s;ufficient magnitude to claim the attention of an Engli&s;h reader; but, the Ca&s;pian fi&s;heries, we &s;hall give an account of, as Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> has related them from the la&s;t gentleman's account.</Q></P>
<P><HI>September.</HI> The weather was &s;o favourable in the beginning of September, that I wi&s;hed to have been able to have profited by it, but the lea&s;t air made my eyes exceedingly painful. I was able, however, to take notice of the wandering birds, and it was delightful to &s;ee them crowd here from the northern di&s;tricts, where, according to accounts received by travellers, the month of September had begun with &s;now and fro&s;t. The&s;e took up their abode in the numberle&s;s lakes of this &s;tep, which afford them plenty of food. Every &s;pot was full of wild-gee&s;e, ducks and all &s;orts of water-fowl, which are never wanting in autumn, in the province of I&s;et|&s;koi. In &s;pring, the&s;e ultra-marine birds direct their flight, fir&s;t to the warm &s;outhern &s;teps, which the &s;now &s;oon for&s;akes, and there &s;tay till the northern rivers are free from ice. They then draw northwards, com|monly with the end of April; particularly the north-goo&s;e <HI>(An&s;er Erythropus),</HI> the ice-duck <HI>(Anas hyemalis),</HI> the large, vari-coloured diver <HI>(Colymbus arcticus),</HI> the
<PB N="138" REF="142">
white &s;now-goo&s;e and many others. Great numbers of the&s;e remain and people the lakes, namely, the large wild-goo&s;e, common ducks, divers, the &s;everal &s;pecies of gulls, the grey and white crane, herons, wood|cocks, &amp;c. yet mo&s;t of them fly al&s;o northward. Several &s;pecies, however, remain in the&s;e warmer di&s;|tricts and never go farther north, particularly the ber|gander <HI>(Tadorna),</HI> and the red duck <HI>(Anas rutila),</HI> which arrives the &s;oone&s;t of all others, (having it's abode in the neighbouring, &s;outhern di&s;tricts and lakes of the A&s;iatic de&s;art) and returns again with the beginning of Augu&s;t, as &s;oon as it's young are fledged. Tho&s;e birds which build their ne&s;ts northwards, return to the &s;outh in autumn and feed in the&s;e watry di&s;tricts, till the general approach of winter drives them more to the &s;outh or acro&s;s the &s;ea. The fir&s;t that return are the common, wild gee&s;e and many &s;pecies of ducks; &s;oon after the&s;e, the north gee&s;e and cranes, and, la&s;t of all, the ice-duck, e&s;pecially on the &s;alt-lakes.</P>
<P>On the arrival of the gee&s;e, preparation is made by the Co&s;&s;acks and pea&s;ants to catch them, a diver&s;ion they are fond of, when harve&s;t is over. The manner of catching is worthy de&s;cription, as they are taken flying, in nets of the following form.</P>
<P>They fix on a lake, pretty well encompa&s;&s;ed with birch-wood; &s;uch a lake this bird prefers, as &s;heltered from the wind and affording a more peaceful retreat,

and greater plenty of food. Every morning, at &s;un|ri&s;e, the gee&s;e leave the&s;e lakes to feed in the open de&s;art or &s;tep, and return at night. On that &s;ide of the lake, or in the place through which the gee&s;e are accu&s;tomed to return, they hew down the birches, &s;o as to leave a &s;traight pa&s;&s;age or alley about &s;ixty feet broad, through which the gee&s;e will afterwards take their flight, which is not very high, when &s;o near home. When there are more lakes than one near each other, they open &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age from one lake to the other; and, as the ducks will crui&s;e through this pa&s;|&s;age often in the cour&s;e of the night, they are caught al&s;o. At twenty-five or thirty fathoms from the lake, they leave, &s;tanding, two very high birch-poles, who&s;e di&s;tance is &s;o &s;tudied, as to fit the net which is &s;pread acro&s;s the avenue from &s;ide to &s;ide. The&s;e nets are made of &s;trong, hempen cord, from thirty-&s;ix to &s;ixty feet long, and from fourteen to twenty feet broad. The upper-part and &s;hort &s;ides are bound with a rope, and at both the upper-corners they fa&s;ten a &s;mall cord. On the top of the two tall trees, converted into poles by cutting off the branches, they fa&s;ten a &s;take perpen|dicularly with a fork at the end; and, climbing up the trees, carry the cords, fa&s;tened to the corners of the net, up, and fix them over the&s;e forks. This enables them to draw up the net to the top of the poles and expand it, &s;o that the upper-part &s;hall be twenty-four or twen|ty-eight feet high, and the lower-part within &s;ix or eight feet of the ground. The net is then &s;trained
<PB N="140" REF="144">
tight and kept &s;o by &s;trings fa&s;tened by pegs to the ground. The end of the ropes that draw up the net, are fa&s;tened al&s;o in the ground, at &s;ome di&s;tance behind, and the fowlers lie down on the gra&s;s, near them, one on each &s;ide, waiting till the morning for their game. The gee&s;e generally ri&s;e from the lake an hour before the &s;un, and, of cour&s;e, do not &s;ee the nets in the dawn, and as they fly with their necks right forward, their heads are &s;oon through the me&s;hes. The fowlers, who have the ends of the ropes in their hands in readi|ne&s;s, no &s;ooner find the gee&s;e touch the net, but they immediately let go the rope, the net falls by the weight of the gee&s;e, and they are entangled and caught. Sometimes they will catch ten, &s;ometimes twenty at a time, but they always catch &s;ome. Be&s;ides the large, common goo&s;e and north-goo&s;e, which is the mo&s;t de|licate bird, roa&s;ted, to be met with, they take, in the &s;ame manner, different &s;orts of ducks and divers. When the net is removed in the morning, they leave the draw-ropes over the forks on the top of the trees, to prevent climbing a &s;econd time, and never remove them wholly, till the &s;ea&s;on of catching is over.</P>
<P>At the latter end of this month, arrived here, Capt. <HI>R. De Ryt&s;chkof,</HI> the &s;on of the learned coun&s;ellor of &s;tate and author of the &s;ame name. I left him in the &s;pring at Ufa, with directions to travel over the nor|thern di&s;tricts of Ca&s;an, and as he employed him&s;elf chiefly in the topography and hi&s;tory of the people,

which will be printed di&s;tinct from this tour of mine, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing about it here.</P>
<P><Q>For the information of our readers, we will endea|vour to &s;upply this deficiency, from that author. The government or regency of Ca&s;an, now compre|hends Permia and the provinces along the Viaitka, neither of which made any part of the antient king|dom of Ca&s;an, till it was &s;ubdued by the Ru&s;&s;ians. The greate&s;t number of the Tartars, di&s;per&s;ed by the war, have &s;ince collected and are &s;ettled in the envi|rons of that city. They are e&s;timated at above 10,000 males, and occupy two con&s;iderable &s;labodes or &s;uburbs of the city of Ca&s;an, one of which is em|belli&s;hed with two &s;tone-built mo&s;ques and &s;everal mi&s;girs or very high, round towers, the remains of the old city. The other &s;labode contains two med&s;cheds, or hou&s;es of wor&s;hip, built of wood. All the other Tartars of this regency, dwell in &s;eparate villages, at &s;mall di&s;tances from each other, and bounded by tho&s;e of the Ru&s;&s;ians.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the little town of Kargala, thirteen miles from Orenburg, is a colony of Ca&s;anian Tartars, &s;ettled in 1755, who, in 1773, paid the tax for 2160 males. The place is rich, having four med&s;cheds, or places of wor&s;hip, and what is very uncommon in this part of the country, a number of pretty large, &s;tone-built hou&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="146">
<Q>The mien, &amp;c. of the Tartars of Ca&s;an, may &s;erve as the characteri&s;tic marks of all the mahome|dan Tartars in their neighbourhood, they are, in general, &s;hort, lean; have a &s;mall face, a fre&s;h com|plexion, little no&s;e, &s;mall mouth and &s;mall, black eyes; a &s;harp look and deep, che&s;nut-coloured hair, which is lank and turns grey long before they are old. They are, in general, well-made, and their &s;prightly manner, &s;traight &s;hape, and mode&s;t or ti|mid mien, give them a very agreeable air.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their capacity is but moderate, but they are haughty and jealous of their honour, negligent, but not lazy, clever at all &s;orts of handicraft-work, neat, &s;ober, frugal and humane. The&s;e virtues they acquire by education and the precepts of their religi|on, to which they are zealou&s;ly devoted. They take a very particular care to educate their children well, teach them to read and write the Arabic language, and bring them up very religiou&s;ly, &s;o that each &s;chool has a chapel and a prie&s;t. It is not uncommon to find collections in manu&s;cript of hi&s;torical anec|dotes, in the huts of the pea&s;ants, and their mer|chants are exten&s;ively acquainted, not only with their own hi&s;tory, but that of adjoining &s;tates, and with the antiquities of each.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Tartarian women are rather of a whole&s;ome complexion than hand&s;ome, of a good con&s;titution,

and, from their infancy, are accu&s;tomed to labour, retirement, mode&s;ty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They habituate their youth to labour, to &s;obriety and a &s;trict ob&s;er|vance of the other manners of their ance&s;tors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The men &s;have their heads, leaving only whi&s;kers, and a little beard upon the chin. They wear linen-&s;hirts, wide trow&s;ers and bu&s;kins of &s;kins; but the poor, wear &s;hoes made of bark. Their other cloath- is a loo&s;e and light gown, a long and wide upper-coat, made after the ea&s;tern mode, with long &s;leeves ending in a point, generally open within the elbow to pa&s;s the arm through; and, on the out&s;ide of all, they wear a belt, to which hangs a &s;abre, a knife and a tobacco-pipe. They wear, on their head, a lea|ther cap, over which they have another &s;ort of cap, flatter and turned up all round, with a padded &s;tuff. The under-garments of the poor, are made either of linen or nankeen, whil&s;t tho&s;e of the rich are com|po&s;ed of &s;ilk, gold and &s;ilver-&s;tuffs. The outer ones are of fine or coar&s;e cloth, according to the wealth of the wearer, &s;ometimes faced and &s;ometimes not; &s;ome wear lace on them, and tho&s;e who can afford it, face their caps with gold embroidery and mount their &s;abres with &s;ilver.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The dre&s;s of the married women, in all the nations where they purcha&s;e their wives, is more co&s;tly than that of the girls, becau&s;e the ornaments of the wife
<PB N="144" REF="149">
do credit to the hu&s;band, whereas tho&s;e of girls, would be a needle&s;s expence. The women dre&s;s like the men, as to &s;hirts, trow&s;ers, &s;tockings, bu&s;kins, &s;lippers, upper and under-garments; only that the half-boots of the women are pointed at the toes and the cut of their cloaths are &s;omewhat different. In &s;ummer-time, their cloaths are like tho&s;e of the T&s;cheremi&s;&s;es. In&s;tead of &s;tockings, they wrap their legs in linen rags, tied on with pack-thread, wound &s;everal times round the calf. Their &s;hoes are made of the bark of trees, cut into &s;hapes and matted. In &s;ummer, they wear nothing over their &s;hift, which is not tucked into their trow&s;ers, but hangs over them, all round. Their &s;hift is clo&s;e at the neck and wri&s;ts, cut into &s;hape and reaches to the knees. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e neck, wri&s;tbands and &s;eams, are covered with a whim&s;ical embroidery of different coloured wor&s;ted, a large buckle keeps it together at the bo&s;om, and a girdle round the wai&s;t. When they would be more dre&s;&s;ed than ordinary, they put over this &s;hift a habit like a morning-gown, made of vari-coloured cloths, tole|rably fine, and edge it with beaver-fur. Their caps are very high and in the &s;hape of a cone, made of birch-bark, covered with &s;kin or linen, ornamented with gla&s;s-beads, little, white &s;hells and &s;ilver-coins. From this cap, a ribbon three inches broad, orna|mented in the &s;ame manner, falls down on the back. Some wear a broad ribbon on the forehead, covered with pieces of money and gla&s;s-beads, in&s;tead of the
<PB N="145" REF="150">
conical cap. They wear, al&s;o, a number of rings, thimbles, and all &s;orts of clattering pendants, at their girdles, which ornaments reach down to the joint of the knee behind, and in walking, they gingle as they go.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In their food, they differ a little from their ance&s;|tors. Gruel and various me&s;&s;es of flour have been introduced, and vegetables of the garden. They eat unleavened bread, baked on the hearth, rice|porridge and the <HI>Kourmat&s;ch,</HI> or parched corn of anti|quity, &s;poken of in Scripture, <HI>Ruth,</HI> iii, 14. This is either wheat, rye, barley or Turki&s;h corn, <HI>(Zea mays Linnaei),</HI> parched at the fire and then brui&s;ed in a mortar, and either eaten in that &s;tate or boiled, or in porridge with milk and water. This Kour|mat&s;ch, kneaded with butter and fried or baked in an oven, is called <HI>Tolkan,</HI> and is a delicacy with the Tartars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of meat, they are at liberty, by the alcoran, to eat camels, hor&s;es, horned cattle, all &s;orts of great game, fallow-deer, &s;heep and goats, mountain-rats, birds, poultry and fi&s;h, but they mu&s;t eat nothing that dies of &s;ickne&s;s or is &s;trangled; on which ac|count, they cut the throats of the animals they catch, and cover the blood they &s;hed with earth. But of all fle&s;h, they prefer the colt, and among all the di&s;hes made of meat, they are fonde&s;t of the <HI>bi&s;bar|mak,</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="151">
or the five-finged di&s;h, &s;o called, becau&s;e they eat with the fingers, without fork or &s;poon: it is a ha&s;h made of fat meat, chopped and &s;tewed. They u&s;e no &s;ea&s;oning; but when they would make a me&s;s uncommonly nice, they add to it grea&s;e or butter. They drink milk alone, or mixed with flour or oat|meal, and make butter or chee&s;e. On a journey, they have bags, into which they put &s;our milk, in order that the whey may run off and enable them to turn the curd to various u&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Water is the common drink of the Tartars of Ca|&s;an; though the rich drink, &s;ometimes, milk, tea and broths. They cannot di&s;pen&s;e with tea, but prepare it different from ours. They boil it in open pots with milk and water, and, having &s;ea&s;oned it with butter and &s;alt, drink it hot, out of china or wooden cups. The alcoran prohibits the u&s;e of wine, &s;pirits or beer, but all, without exception, drink mead, thus made&mdash;The common &s;ort is made of oatmeal, flour and honey, fermented together, and put into a &s;olution of honey and &s;even times the quantity of hot water, filling up the ca&s;k with the &s;o|lution, as they draw it for u&s;e, &s;o that a ca&s;k will la&s;t a long time;&mdash;this they call <HI>A&s;e-bab.</HI> Another kind of mead, made of honey, whey and wild cher|ries, beaten together, they call <HI>Eiran.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="152">
<Q>Only a &s;mall number, even of the rich, &s;leep on feather-beds; the u&s;ual manner is to put a piece of felt or carpeting on the bench which goes round the room, and to lie down upon it. Very few have pillows, and they never take off their cloaths at night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The koran enjoins a cleanline&s;s, which they carry to exce&s;s. They wa&s;h them&s;elves, all over, &s;everal times every day, and, lea&s;t they &s;hould contract any impurity from the natural excretion of urine, they make water &s;itting on their heels.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They commonly eat four times a day. The bench on which they &s;leep, &s;erves them for table and chairs, each &s;itting on his legs, after the ea&s;tern manner. They wa&s;h and pray before and after each meal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In wealthy families, the women lodge and eat a|part, and are veiled when they go abroad, and even at home they are never &s;een, but when the hu&s;band wi&s;hes to &s;hew particular re&s;pect to his gue&s;ts. The lower cla&s;s of women and &s;ervants are le&s;s retired, and walk abroad publickly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Old men, of good character, are held in great ve|neration, and as the beard turns grey very early in life, with them <HI>Ak&s;chakal,</HI> or grey-beard, is an ho|nourable title, which they confer on &s;uch men as are
<PB N="148" REF="153">
wi&s;e and prudent. The&s;e are always con&s;ulted in matters of importance, &s;upply the place of prie&s;ts, have always precedence and are arbitrators in all di&s;|putes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The alcoran admitting of polygamy, every man is allowed four wives, but the greate&s;t part have but one; the rich often take two, &s;ome will go &s;o far as three, but very few venture upon four. The&s;e wives all enjoy the &s;ame right, each having a claim to the care&s;&s;es of her hu&s;band in her turn. The purcha&s;e and maintenance of wives being expen&s;ive, and more than one creating di&s;turbance in a family, they con|&s;ult their intere&s;t rather more than their plea&s;ure, and do not run to the end of the line allotted them. The cu&s;tom is, to marry a &s;econd wife when the fir&s;t cea&s;es to be young and lo&s;es the power of plea&s;ing; yet this fir&s;t is the principal wife, though the new one is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hu&s;band's affections. Mer|chants, who travel, have a wife at every place where they have a hou&s;e. Should a merchant's wife in|trigue, he gives her up to her gallant and takes an|other. A Ghivin&s;ian, at Orenburg, who had thus di&s;po&s;ed of his eighth wife, was already promi&s;ed to a ninth. Parents urge their &s;ons to marry whil&s;t boys, but do not &s;o with their daughters. In the regency of Ca&s;an and Orenburgh, the kalym or price of a wife is from twenty rubles to 500; but the bride
<PB N="149" REF="154">
generally brings a fortune with her, equal to a fourth-part and, &s;ometimes, to the half of what &s;he co&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The evening before marriage, the part over the <HI>os pubis</HI> is &s;horn by women, and the e&s;pou&s;als con&s;i&s;t in a public declaration of the agreement be|tween the parties contracting; a prie&s;t then re|peats a prayer, pronounces them to be man and wife, and the fe&s;tival is clo&s;ed with mu&s;ic and dancing. They have an in&s;trument, peculiar to them, called <HI>Koba,</HI> a kind of violin, open at top, in &s;hape &s;ome|thing like a gondola, having two hair-&s;trings and played on with a fiddle-&s;tick; the notes &s;topped by the fingers of the left-hand, like a violin. The &s;ongs of the Tartars are commonly in blank-ver&s;e, but very poetical and full of expre&s;&s;ion. Lovers com|pare each other to the &s;weet crane and tender turtle-dove, and pre&s;ent them with their eyes, their eye|brows, &amp;c. Their mu&s;ic is martial, the dancing of the men, bri&s;k and lively; but that of the women, &s;low and trailing, with the hands always held before the face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Barrenne&s;s in a wife is a great di&s;grace, e&s;pecially if a man has but one wife, and the barren women is always de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e that have children. A wo|man, after child-birth, is held impure, till the cu&s;|tomary &s;igns of health return, at which times &s;he pu|rifies her&s;elf by prayer and bathing. The child is
<PB N="150" REF="155">
carried to the prie&s;t within &s;even days of it's birth, who whi&s;pers a prayer into it's ear, gives it a name and then prays aloud. The name given, is generally that of the month in which it is born, &s;o that the whole nation would have but thirteen names, if the father did not give the child the additional one of &s;ome relation, which is always done at the fe&s;tival-dinner, given on this occa&s;ion. Among the Nogay|an Tartars, &s;ettled about A&s;trachan, they endeavour to facilitate the delivery of women, by fixing a belt under their arms, hoi&s;ting them up by this and letting them fall &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Boys are circumci&s;ed between the age of &s;ix and fifteen, by a man who makes it his profe&s;&s;ion, and, as it is di&s;honourable not to have un|dergone this ceremony before the age of fifteen, the rich always pay for the poor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When per&s;ons are dangerou&s;ly ill, they are vi&s;ited by the prie&s;t, who prays with them. When dead, the corp&s;e is wa&s;hed, wrapped in a linen or cotton winding-&s;heet, &s;o as to have the face only uncovered, and then &s;prinkled with camphire. This done, the prie&s;t fa&s;tens a label on the brea&s;t of the decea&s;ed, with this &s;entence written on it, in Arabic, <HI>There is but one God and Mahomet is his Prophet.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The body is carried to the grave in a coffin, but put into the earth without it. The graves are five or &s;ix feet deep, made north-we&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t,
<PB N="151" REF="156">
with a &s;pace on one &s;ide within it, large enough to hold the body. Here it is placed, &s;o that when the earth is thrown on, it does not touch the corp&s;e; for they conceive, that after a &s;hort time, two angels take it to the judgment-&s;eat. For the fir&s;t three days, it is not lawful to light a fire in the hou&s;e of the de|cea&s;ed; and, during the fir&s;t month, &s;olemn prayers are &s;aid twice a-day for the dead, under an idea, that his trial is going on in that time. One pa&s;&s;age in their ritual is, <HI>O God, give him not over unto Hell, but tran&s;plant him &s;hortly into Paradi&s;e!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The graves of the rich are di&s;tingui&s;hed by erect|ing over them a little hut of balks, or by placing &s;tones round them; for the &s;plendid times are pa&s;t in which the &s;tately mau&s;oleum was erected to the dead. Others place only a po&s;t, with a &s;hort in&s;crip|tion on it, whil&s;t others have a head-&s;tone and an epi|taph on it. A &s;pecimen of the&s;e epitaphs, we have given when &s;peaking of Ufa.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Not to enter into a detail of all the Mahomedan doctrines and opinions, it will &s;uffice to &s;hew the ac|cu&s;tomed ceremonies and general belief of the fol|lowers of Mahomet, in the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. Moder|tion, in religious matters, being held to be a mortal &s;in, every village has it's med&s;ched, or chapel. In cities, mo&s;ques are &s;pacious and neat, but without ornament, and, within, is an elevated place where
<PB N="152" REF="157">
the koran is read and explained. The floor is co|vered with carpets, and before the door is a &s;mall ve&s;|tibule, where every per&s;on leaves his &s;hoes, on en|tering the hou&s;e of prayer. So &s;ay the Scriptures. <HI>Take thy &s;hoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy ground.</HI> The med&s;cheds of &s;mall vil|lages are poor, little huts, badly con&s;tructed, with a gallery in&s;tead of a &s;teeple, from whence the &s;exton calls the people to devotion. The clergy are com|po&s;ed of agouns or high-prie&s;ts, and moulas or prie&s;ts. One of their agouns has his &s;eat at Ca&s;an, another at A&s;trachan and a third at Tobol&s;k. The clergy have no &s;ettled income, but are often obliged to get a living by trade.</Q></P>
<P><Q>According to their faith, a mahomedan becomes impure, by touching a dead body, eating unclean food, coition, all the natural excretions and many other actions; but bathing and prayer will purify the polluted body, of cour&s;e, they are always at it, for piety and good, they &s;ay, de&s;erve heaven. They have &s;everal ways of bathing, but the mo&s;t common is merely wa&s;hing their hands; their good works con&s;i&s;t chiefly in fa&s;ting and alms; 205 days of the year they neither eat nor drink, till after &s;un-&s;et.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Tartars are &s;trong prede&s;tinarians. They be|lieve that the de&s;tiny of every man is fixed. and that the angel of death calls him at his appointed hour;
<PB N="153" REF="158">
a belief that &s;upports them in adver&s;ity and guards them from &s;uicide. Numbers indulge a piety bor|dering on enthu&s;ia&s;m and imagine it is po&s;&s;ible, by religion, to become a &s;aint, and that departed &s;aints receive the prayers of the living. Five times a-day are they called to wor&s;hip, by the &s;exton, who &s;ings out their creed, namely, <HI>There is but one God and Ma|homet is his prophet.</HI> Nothing interrupts them in their devotion, which they always perform with fervency, turning their face towards Mecca, or, if at home, towards the word <HI>Alla,</HI> which is the name of God, and written up in &s;ome part of every man's hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The prayers of the Tartars are written in Arabic. Every one has a ro&s;ary, by which he makes his peti|tions. The prie&s;t &s;its cro&s;s-legged facing the con|gregation, reading the prayers in a &s;oft and pathetic tone of voice, and the a&s;&s;embly repeats them, or an|&s;wers <HI>Amin!</HI> When the word <HI>Alla</HI> is pronounced, every one heaves a profound &s;igh, &s;tops his ears and puts hands over his eyes and beard, as if &s;en&s;ible of his unworthine&s;s to hear the glorious name, or lift up his eyes to Heaven. During the prayers that are addre&s;&s;ed to tutelary angels, they ca&s;t their eyes about to the right and left. At other parts of the &s;ervice, they &s;it down cro&s;s-legged, ri&s;e often up, bend the body profoundly forward, remain &s;o bent a a long time, and frequently throw them&s;elves pro&s;|trate. Every one is without his &s;hoes; the rich, in
<PB N="154" REF="159">
prayer-time, put on a Turki&s;h turban. The agouns wear them always, and the moulas keep on their common cap, during the &s;ervice of the mo&s;que.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They wa&s;h them&s;elves prior to their taking an oath, then &s;triking the koran, three times, again&s;t their brea&s;t, &s;ay, <HI>May thy cur&s;e &s;mite me, if I &s;wear fal&s;ely!</HI></Q></P>
<P>The other gentleman, who had been at my de&s;ire, continues our Author, to in&s;pect the fi&s;heries in the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and who&s;e name is <HI>Sokolof,</HI> had an oppor|tunity, in the cour&s;e of &s;ix months and a favourable &s;ea&s;on, of making many ob&s;ervations on animals, birds, in&s;ects and plants, which I had not an opportuni|ty of doing my&s;elf.

<P>In July, Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> &s;tretched away we&s;tward from the Jaik into the Kalmuck &s;tep and &s;aw there, at a di&s;tance, tho&s;e little wild, Kirgui&s;ian hor&s;es, called <HI>Kulan,</HI> but could not get near them, as they took &s;light at the approach of the hunters. He travelled near fifty miles over this &s;alt-&s;tep, without being able to find a drop of fre&s;h-water: at la&s;t, he reached a low plain over&s;pread with &s;alt-lakes, abounding with glau|ber-&s;alts, which form beautiful chry&s;tals in the water and leave, at the bottom, a &s;ediment of the &s;ame mix|ed with common &s;alt. Some have the wonderful pro|perty of depo&s;ing a &s;alt, quite red and &s;melling like violets, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of glauber-&s;alts, with a very &s;mall mixture of kitchen-&s;alt; the chief rea&s;on of this &s;eems to be the &s;oil, which con&s;i&s;ts of a great quantity of &s;ea-mu&s;cles, converted into chalk.</P>
<P>After traver&s;ing near forty miles over this plain and a di&s;tance of thirty more over a &s;andy de&s;art, without a tree and &s;carce a plant, he reached the Ca&s;pian &s;hore. In this &s;andy de&s;art, he met with a plant and
<PB N="156" REF="161">
a bu&s;h, peculiar to the&s;e &s;ands; the plant is a fennel, <HI>(Ferula),</HI> de&s;cribed at the end of this volume: the bu&s;h grows &s;ix feet high, in a dry quick&s;and, and never has been known to botani&s;ts; as &s;uch, it de&s;erves par|ticular notice. I have given a drawing of it; &s;ee page 66; and al&s;o, at the end of this volume, a de|&s;cription; and as this plant is, by it's whole &s;tructure, vi&s;ibly different from every known genus, I think I am at liberty to give it a generical name, and have called it <HI>Pterococcus Aphyllus.</HI> See the plate. The Kalmucks and Bucharians call this bu&s;h, <HI>Torlok,</HI> and &s;ay, it is to be met with in the &s;andy de&s;arts of the Kirgue&s;e, and that they u&s;e it's knotty &s;tem, which, near the root, is about one inch and a half diameter, to make tobacco-pipes of, which it is very fit for, on account of the hardne&s;s of it's wood. The fre&s;h roots of the bu&s;h, if &s;plit through, yield a great deal of clear gum, which in quality is almo&s;t &s;imilar to the traganth, &s;wells very much in water, and yields a brown-yellow and &s;weeti&s;h jelly, and if it &s;tands warm, will in a few days, take on a vinous fermentation. After this bu&s;h has dropped it's octagonal &s;eeds or nuts, it remains till autumn bare and leafle&s;s, like ru&s;hes, which &s;hoot up longer and longer, till they divide into new branches. The&s;e fall towards winter, leaving nothing but the wooden branches, which produce again young twigs, and blo&s;|&s;om in &s;pring. This plant I &s;hall &s;peak of further hereafter.</P>

<P>The fi&s;hery along the northern coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, is held on lea&s;e, by the merchants of A&s;trachan, in which their chief wealth con&s;i&s;ts. The neare&s;t place from the mouth of the Jaik, where this fi&s;hery is car|ried on, is a bay about fifty miles di&s;tant, formerly called <HI>Bogatoi Kultuk,</HI> (the rich bay), on account of the multitude of fi&s;h there caught. At the end of March, the Ca&s;pian &s;ea is clear from ice. The fi&s;hery begins in April, and Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> &s;et out on the 20th of that month, to take a view of it. He went in a boat to the &s;aid bay, as the way was impa&s;&s;able by land. Near the bay are five fi&s;hing towns and magazines. The bay is &s;o full of fi&s;h, that they fi&s;h it, with &s;ucce&s;s, at five different times in the year. For 100 miles to the we&s;t of this bay, there is no fi&s;hing carried on, except in the middle of &s;ummer, and the &s;had and barbel-fi&s;h|ing, with nets, in &s;pring and autumn, there being no other fi&s;h, on account of the different &s;pecies of &s;tur|geon, with which the bay and &s;hallows of the coa&s;t a|bound, owing to the water being fre&s;hened by the flowing of &s;ome rivers into it. In the&s;e places they de|po&s;e their &s;pawn, or go up the river to pa&s;s the winter; be&s;ides, the quantity of &s;ea-weeds here harbours &s;hoals
<PB N="158" REF="163">
of little fi&s;h, which &s;erve as food to fi&s;hes of a larger &s;pecies.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;t, as far as the fi&s;hery extends, there are watagas or magazines erected, where are &s;alted only large fi&s;h, &s;uch as the different &s;pecies of &s;turgeon, &s;ewrjugs, &s;almon and barbel. Each wataga has boats of different &s;izes and &s;tructure, fit to go out to &s;ea with a few men. The large&s;t are manned with five men, the &s;malle&s;t with two, and are equipped with &s;ails. Near each wataga, is a large ve&s;&s;el, with provi&s;ions, in&s;truments and &s;alt for &s;alting the fi&s;h, which is brought from the Imperial magazine, at A&s;trachan. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ail to and fro, from A&s;trachan to the fi&s;heries, bring &s;alt and other materials, and return loaded with fi&s;h, which is landed on wharfs, near the watagas. The fi&s;h is cut open, cleaned, wa&s;hed, &amp;c. on floats, which are &s;ometimes covered, and the ve&s;|&s;els from the&s;e floats are laden and unladen. The workmen are all hired from the interior parts of Ru&s;&s;ia and the towns &s;ituated along the Wolga: they are &s;ometimes engaged for the whole year, &s;ometimes only for a &s;pring, autumn or winter-fi&s;hery. Some of them are Kalmucks of the ulu&s;s of Bambar, who had taken up their winter-quarters about the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, before the greate&s;t part of the Kalmuck hordes had left this di&s;trict. Each wataga employs from fifty to 120 men, as the tenant can afford. Some are engaged as &s;teer&s;|men, &s;ome as rowers, &s;ome to &s;alt the fi&s;h, &s;ome to
<PB N="159" REF="164">
dre&s;s the roe and others to prepare the fi&s;h-glue, &amp;c. all according to the different branches they have &s;er|ved an apprentice&s;hip to, for which they have a &s;alary, never exceeding forty or fifty rubles for each fi&s;hing-&s;ea&s;on; but the general pay is twenty rubles. Old &s;teer&s;men, who have acquired more &s;kill in the fi&s;hery, by long practice and experience, are appointed as di|rectors, and the&s;e have better pay.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e men, there are many merchants and citizens, from A&s;trachan, that re&s;ide here, during the fi&s;hery. The&s;e people agree with the proprietor, or tenant, and fi&s;h for him, at a certain price for all the fi&s;h they catch, u&s;ing their own boats and implements. The price paid for each &s;ewrjug, is from four to &s;ix copecs, each copec one half-penny, Engli&s;h; and each bjeluga, from eight to twelve copecs; but, fi&s;hes of extra &s;ize, are counted as two or more.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the hou&s;es of the fi&s;hermen, near every wa|taga, are many &s;heds and covered places, where the roe is prepared, the fi&s;h-glue and back-&s;inews dried, and all the materials kept for fi&s;hing. For the &s;alted fi&s;h, they have caves and &s;ubterraneous ice-cellars of different &s;izes. The&s;e contain a wooden floor and large wooden troughs, in which the &s;alt-pickle is prepared. On each &s;ide of the pickling-troughs are divi&s;ions, where the fi&s;h is laid after it has been taken from the &s;alt, and is again &s;trewed over with fre&s;h &s;alt; and be|hind
<PB N="160" REF="165">
the&s;e divi&s;ions the &s;pace is filled with ice, in order to keep the fi&s;h fre&s;h.</P>
<P>The watagas are &s;ituated in places where the &s;ea is deep enough to carry ve&s;&s;els and where the &s;hore, by it's elevation, is &s;heltered again&s;t the &s;outh-wind, which &s;wells the waves and makes them la&s;h the &s;hore. The&s;e &s;pots, then, are commonly high capes, where the &s;ea forms deep bays, and from which the &s;tep is &s;epa|rated by ru&s;hy &s;ea-mar&s;hes, pa&s;&s;able only in boats. On the&s;e capes, grows as much gra&s;s as is nece&s;&s;ary to feed the hor&s;es kept for the winter-fi&s;hery. The duties which the watagas pay to the &s;tate, are in proportion to the quantity of fi&s;h-glue and roe they prepare. Each pud of fi&s;h-glue pays five rubles, and each pud of roe, two rubles, eighty copecs.</P>
<P>In &s;pring, the bay is crowded with beljugas, &s;ewr|jugs and Wolga &s;turgeons, at this time, without roe, coming here only to feed; but &s;ewrjugs depo&s;e their &s;pawn at this &s;ea&s;on, and do not return the whole year. In winter and autumn, they catch only beljugas, which collect here to &s;pawn and pa&s;s the winter.</P>
<P>The &s;pring-fi&s;hery begins as &s;oon as the &s;ea is free from ice, which often happens in the middle of March. Then large &s;hoals of &s;mall fi&s;hes approach the coa&s;t; of the&s;e, one little fi&s;h, <HI>(Cyprinus Griflagine),</HI> called, in Ru&s;s, <HI>Obla,</HI> about an inch long, is the mo&s;t fa|vourite
<PB N="161" REF="166">
food of the beljugas, who, &s;oon after, follow them in great multitudes. As &s;oon as the obla appears, they catch a great many of them, in drag-nets, put them alive into re&s;ervoirs and pre&s;erve them as baits for the hooks, as the beljuga bites at nothing &s;o &s;oon. When the beljugas enter the bay in troops, which is generally a fortnight after the appearance of the obla, the fi&s;hery begins. If this time is pa&s;&s;ed over, the tenant lo&s;es his advantage. Then the fi&s;hers are at work night and day, and as &s;oon as they have brought one boat-load a&s;hore, they pu&s;h off for another. In bri&s;k &s;ea-gales, there is the be&s;t fi&s;hing, for it has been ob&s;erved, that &s;uch gales drive the fi&s;h upon the coa&s;t; but if the wind blows from the land, it always impove|ri&s;hes the fi&s;hery. In good &s;ea&s;ons, a boat will catch upwards of fifty large fi&s;hes in two hours.</P>
<P>The beljuga is caught here with lines and hooks. The tackling con&s;i&s;ts of &s;eventeen ropes, 144 feet in length, to which they tie 125 cords, each cord ten feet long, with hooks fa&s;tened to it, at the di&s;tance of eighteen inches from each other. Thirty of &s;uch tack|lings compo&s;e what they call a <HI>Sna&s;t,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome hundred fathoms of line. Between every &s;na&s;t, is tied a &s;tone, weighing many pounds, and al&s;o a buoy of dried reed-mace, which floats on a rope fourteen feet long. To all this tackling, are fa&s;tened two anchors. Such an anchor con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;plit pieces of a tree, each of which has a &s;trong branch at one end,
<PB N="162" REF="167">
that gives it the form of an anchor, and this is loaded with bricks, to give it weight. Each anchor has a cable of about twenty-fathoms long. When the anchors are ca&s;t, they tie an obla to each hook, and the whole is thrown into water three or four fathoms deep, &s;o that the tackling lies at the bottom, giving the baits a liberty of &s;wimming; and, the beljugas greedily &s;wallowing them, are caught on the hooks; and as the anchors keep the tackling in it's &s;ituation, the large&s;t fi&s;h cannot e&s;cape. The whole is rai&s;ed twice a-day and drawn, with the fi&s;h, into the &s;hip. When taken off the hooks, to prevent their fainting by lying together, a rope is drawn through their gills and they are let down the &s;hip's &s;ide into the water, in order to be brought a&s;hore alive. When a&s;hore, they are drawn by hooks upon a &s;caffold, and cut up one after another. Fir&s;t, they &s;plit the head with an ax, then cut open the belly and take out the entrails, roe, glue-bladder and, la&s;t of all, the dor&s;al &s;inews. The lower part of the abdomen and the bowels, are thrown away, but the wide and fle&s;hy &s;nout is &s;alted, and &s;old at five or &s;ix copecs each. A middling &s;ized beljuga, has a &s;tomach that will contain two whole &s;ea-calves or &s;eals, be&s;ides a great number of &s;mall fi&s;hes. In &s;pring, the beljuga has &s;eldom any roe, but mo&s;t are milters. After having taken the roe out, they tear out the glue or air-bladder, which occupies the whole back, put it into a pail and prepare to extract the i&s;ing-gla&s;s; they next cut open the cartilages of the back, draw out the
<PB N="163" REF="168">
back-&s;inews, wa&s;h them and hang them up, over poles, to dry.</P>
<P>When all the bowels are taken out, the fat, which lies plentifully about the milt, in milters, is &s;craped off with knives, collected in a pail and afterwards boiled and cleaned. This fre&s;h fat is good-ta&s;ted, and may be u&s;ed in&s;tead of butter or oil. In A&s;trachan, it is &s;old from forty to fifty copecs <HI>per</HI> pail.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h, thus cleaned, is wa&s;hed and carried into the above-mentioned caves, where it lies for twelve hours, or more, in a &s;trong pickle or brine; it is then put into boxes and covered with &s;alt. Beljugas are here caught of an enormous &s;ize. In the winter, 1769, one was taken &s;eventeen feet in length and it weighed &s;eventy puds, that is upwards of 2500 lb. from which they took twenty puds of roe, or 720 lb. The large&s;t &s;ewrjug never exceeds nine feet in length, from the point of the &s;nout to the end of the tail-fins. Large beljugas will &s;wallow young &s;eals, gee&s;e and wild-ducks, whole.</P>
<P>Soon after the beljuga fi&s;hery is over, and often be|fore, that of the &s;ewrjug begins. This does not la&s;t above a fortnight and is but once a year, as they come up into the fre&s;her water to &s;pawn. This fir&s;t is caught in nets and, if a favourable gale blows, they come in &s;uch quantities, that the ve&s;&s;el will not contain the
<PB N="164" REF="169">
draught, but they mu&s;t be brought to land by ropes. Each wataga will catch, in a &s;hort time, &s;ixty or &s;eventy thou&s;and; but if contrary winds blow, only half the quantity. This fi&s;hery is important on ac|count of the roe, or cavear, which is prepared two ways; one is called granular, the other bag-cavear. The granular, is pre&s;&s;ed through a coar&s;e &s;ieve, to clean&s;e it from the &s;kins and blood-ve&s;&s;els, and then &s;alted in troughs. One pud of roe, will take five pounds of &s;alt. It remains in the&s;e troughs about an hour, is then &s;pread over fine &s;ieves, that the &s;uperflu|ous brine may drain away, and after this, it is bar|relled.</P>
<P>The bag-cavear, after being cleaned from the &s;kins, is put, for half an hour, into &s;trong brine, then taken out and drained, by laying it on &s;ieves; after this, it is put into pointed bags, like tho&s;e u&s;ed in apotheca|ries' &s;hops, each bag containing eighteen pounds. In the&s;e bags it is &s;queezed till all the brine is out, and then put into barrels and trod down, by a man in lea|ther &s;tockings; afterwards, the ca&s;ks are clo&s;ed and well done over with tar, to prevent any of the roe run|ning out. Bag-cavear, is &s;old at two rubles the pud; the granular, at one ruble, eighty copecs.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h-glue, is made from the internal membrane of the air-bladders. The&s;e are cut open lengthways, laid to dry a little in the &s;un, the internal membrane then
<PB N="165" REF="170">
&s;eperated from the external, pre&s;&s;ed with heavy weights, in a wet cloth or mat, one whole day, then cut into pieces, rolled up and dried in the &s;hade. Sewrjug|glue &s;ells, at A&s;trachan, for thirty-five rubles the pud; beljuga-glue, for twenty-five or thirty-rubles. Sewr|jugs, they &s;alt and dry in the &s;un, for the table.</P>
<P>When the fi&s;hery is over, the cavear, glue, &amp;c. and &s;alt-fi&s;h, is brought to A&s;trachan by land, and there &s;lowed away in cellars, till &s;old. The proprietors of the fi&s;heries do not &s;ell retail, but di&s;po&s;e of their whole property, or employ the merchants of A&s;trachan to &s;ell it by commi&s;&s;ion, at &s;o much a hundred; not the hun|dred weight, but 100 pieces, according to the &s;ize of the fi&s;h: each fi&s;h from eighteen to thirty-&s;ix inches long, from eye to tail, is reckoned as one piece; tho&s;e un|der eighteen inches count two for one piece; a fi&s;h of thirty-&s;ix inches, counts as two pieces, thirty-nine for three pieces, forty-two for four, and &s;o on. A hundred &s;uch b ljugas, at the fir&s;t hand, will &s;ell for &s;eventy or &s;eventy-five rubles. Sewrjugs, without be|ing mea&s;ured are &s;old from ten to fifteen rubles <HI>per</HI> hundred. Barbels are valued at &s;orty rubles per 1000. All kinds of &s;turgeon, caught in rivers, are con&s;idered as better and more delicate, and will &s;ell ten <HI>per cent.</HI> dearer than &s;ea-fi&s;h. The dried back-&s;inews &s;ell, at A&s;trachan, for one ruble and a half <HI>per</HI> pud; but, when the fi&s;h is &s;old whole&s;ale, the&s;e &s;inews are given in, according to the quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="171">In the winter-fi&s;hery, they break the ice in places where they fi&s;h, bring to the wataga what they catch, on &s;ledges, and &s;end it, frozen, to A&s;trachan, where 100 &s;uch fre&s;h beljugas, will &s;ell for 120 rubles. Shads weigh, here, eight puds and barbel one and a half. The former are uncommonly fat in &s;ummer and are then called <HI>Sharkoi Som,</HI> (hot &s;hads). They like it's fat hinder-parts and tail, but the head and fore-part is thrown away. Barbel-roe is al&s;o thrown away, but they make a kind of bad glue of it's air-bladder.</P>
<P><HI>Tjumen.</HI> My eyes getting better I &s;at out, in the middle of December, and, after travelling about 170 miles, reached the town of Tjumen, &s;ituated on the Tura, on the 19th. This town, after being de&s;troyed by fire, is new-built, in regular &s;treets. Here I had the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with Dr. <HI>Lepechin,</HI> a mem|ber of the Imperial academy of &s;ciences, for &s;ome hours. He re&s;olved to pa&s;s his winter here. At night I continued my journey over the Tura, near the burial-place of the famous <HI>Steller,</HI> well-known for his tour to Kam&s;chatka. In nineteen hours, I reached Tobol|&s;koi, a di&s;tance of 191 miles. This road is very well regulated, for, at every twenty-four or thirty-&s;ix miles, there are places erected for the accommodation of tra|vellers and changing of hor&s;es. The di&s;trict between Tjumen and Tobol&s;koi, which I travelled over, is an open plain, with here and there a &s;mall wood.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="172">I &s;hall not take up any time in de&s;cribing the city of Tobol&s;koi, however important it is to the government of Siberia, it having been fully done by <HI>Gmelin,</HI> in his tour to Siberia.

<P><Q>Tobol&s;koi is the capital of Siberia, has an arch|bi&s;hop and was built in 1587, by the government of Ru&s;&s;ia, ju&s;t at the confluence of the Tobol with the Irti&s;h, in the room of the ancient city Sibir, that was burnt down, and &s;tood twelve miles lower down the river, on the right-hand &s;hore of the Irti&s;h.

When <HI>Yermak</HI> had penetrated as far as the Irti&s;h, in 1582, and driven from thence the Khan of Siberia, Sibir was demoli&s;hed, and the Tartars of tho&s;e parts were in general di&s;per&s;ed.

Their villages contain from ten to fifty farms, and they are in num|ber about 4000 males. They are Mahomedans, and re&s;emble altogether, in their manners and cu&s;toms, the poorer &s;ort of the Tartar villagers of Ca&s;an.

<P>Hitherto the di&s;trict of the regency of Orenburg and the adjacent provinces had been the object of my en|quiries; but they having all been vi&s;ited and examined either by me, Dr. <HI>Lepechin,</HI> or Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Falk,</HI> the chief end of the Imperial academy of &s;ciences was at|tained and the few remaining objects, worth notice, would be in&s;pected on our return, or by the mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of our learned a&s;&s;i&s;tants. Much more, however, being to be done in the natural hi&s;tory of the&s;e domini|ons and the exten&s;ive kingdom of Siberia, and the northern di&s;tricts of the empire promi&s;ing many di&s;co|veries, having not yet been thoroughly explored, and many accounts of <HI>Gmelin's</HI> and <HI>Steller's</HI> tours through Siberia, having been lo&s;t, the Imperial academy agreed to a plan, &s;ormed by me and Dr. <HI>Lepechin,</HI> which was, that he &s;hould travel, on his return, to the norther-mo&s;t di&s;tricts of the regency of Ca&s;an, the whole of Archangel and the coa&s;ts of the White Sea, and, that I &s;hould extend my journey even beyond the di&s;tricts of the &s;ea Baikal, to view and de&s;cribe &s;uch places, which had been &s;lightly pa&s;&s;ed over by the late Mr. <HI>Gmelin,</HI> or had undergone an alteration &s;ince he was there, e&s;pecially the di&s;tant Siberian mines and manu|factories, and the inhabited &s;outhern frontiers, to collect carefully every remarkable plant, and do the &s;ame in

Zoology, thus fulfilling perfectly, what preceding tra|vellers had accidentally only taken up in their way, and who&s;e labours were devoted to botanical views and, of cour&s;e, but little had been tran&s;mitted to the &s;cien|tific world. To accompli&s;h this plan, it was nece&s;&s;ary not to lo&s;e time, but to di&s;patch the mo&s;t learned of my a&s;&s;i&s;tants to different di&s;tricts. On the 24th, then, of February, I &s;ent Mr. <HI>Ba&s;il Surjef</HI> through Tobol&s;koi, to the northern town Bere&s;owa, &s;ituated on the Ob or Oby, from whence he was to proceed, in the begin|ning of &s;ummer, as far as Obdor&s;koi O&s;trog, down the Ob, and, if pa&s;&s;able, as far as the Icy Sea.</P>
<P>In the middle of march, Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Falk</HI> arrived here from Orenburg, with the la&s;t &s;ledge, having fixed up|on a Siberian tour and wi&s;hing to con&s;ult me on the &s;ubject. He had made, along the line, a very plea&s;ant journey, but a very dangerous one, and came here a fortnight later than his a&s;&s;i&s;tant Mr. <HI>Georgi,</HI> celebrated by his tran&s;lations and other works of merit, and who came the &s;traight road over the Ural. The arrival of the&s;e gentlemen made my re&s;idence, in T&s;cheljabyn|&s;kaja, more agreeable than it had hitherto been, and I had only to lament that the &s;udden arrival of &s;pring obliged us to part company.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Rit&s;chkof,</HI> who had been with me mo&s;t part of the winter, &s;eemed di&s;inclined, on account of his deli|cate con&s;titution, to travel with me into Siberia, and
<PB N="171" REF="176">
reque&s;ted me, to procure leave from the academy at Peter&s;burg, to return home, taking &s;ome di&s;tricts of the Ural in his way, that had not been vi&s;ited. This leave was obtained; but, it being ju&s;t determined to di&s;patch a body of light-hor&s;e, from the fort Or&s;kaja, under the command of Colonel <HI>Traubenberg,</HI> into the Kirgui&s;ian &s;tep, in order to pur&s;ue the removed Kal|muck hordes, this excellent opportunity thus offering it&s;elf, Captain <HI>Rit&s;chkof</HI> could not with&s;tand, and as he wi&s;hed to accompany them, I con&s;ented to his going. He went, and the &s;ucce&s;s of his difficult journey, with his ob&s;ervations, may be read in his own journal.</P>
<P>I prepared for my own journey, but, before my &s;et|ting out, thought proper to pen down &s;ome general ac|count of the province of I&s;et&s;koi, where I wintered. Of all the ports that belong to the regency of Oren|burg, this is, inconte&s;tably, the happie&s;t for fertility and tillage, and tolerably well peopled; yet, not &s;o much as it de&s;erves for the richne&s;s of it's &s;oil. They reckon here 57,391 male inhabitants, among which are 4,352 that trade and pay no head-tax. The different Ba&s;ki|rian ulu&s;&s;es, &s;ettled ea&s;tward from the Ural, con&s;i&s;ting of 4,118 habitations, belong to this province, be&s;ides 456 habitations of Med&s;cheraks and Tartars. If this population is compared with the extent of the province, which is near 225 miles long and broad, it will natural|ly occur, that even this great number of people is not &s;ufficient to cultivate the country. At pre&s;ent, they
<PB N="172" REF="177">
&s;ow, annually, near 100,000 de&s;&s;atins of land, each de&s;&s;atin one hundred &s;quare fathoms, and they com|monly reap ten-&s;old of what they &s;ow. Rye and wheat are the chief grain here, but they &s;ow, occa&s;ionally, barley and oats, not only &s;upplying a great part of the line of Orenburg, but all the manufactories &s;ituated on the Ural and part of tho&s;e of Catherineburg. In the general failure of the crops, in 1769, when even in many places of this province, they &s;carce reaped as much as they &s;owed, on account of the long, dry weather; yet the crops here were &s;o great, as not only to &s;upply the above-mentioned places, but al&s;o the ad|jacent provinces of the whole regency or government of Orenburg, and ab&s;olutely &s;aved them from famine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the great growth of corn in this province, the &s;oil, which is black and rich throughout, even to the depth of two feet in &s;ome places, yields not only the fine&s;t gra&s;s, but is fit for gardens. All common vege|tables pro&s;per here exceedingly, e&s;pecially turneps, which grow to an enormous &s;ize. Yet, through the negligence of the inhabitants, here are only &s;own, coleworts, turneps and par&s;neps. They cultivate a few hops, but the&s;e growing &s;o plentifully wild, every where in the Uralian mountains, rai&s;ing them is un|nece&s;&s;ary, Flax and hemp is al&s;o &s;own here, but not being a &s;aleable article, the farmer never &s;ows more than is nece&s;&s;ary for his own u&s;e. In a garden, in the mid&s;t of a de&s;ert, which has been many years aban|doned,
<PB N="173" REF="178">
I &s;aw, with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;pontaneou&s;ly grow|ing, the mallow-flower, the turn&s;ol, the French mari|gold, <HI>(Tagetes),</HI> and the holy thi&s;tle. Garden &s;traw|berries and the dwarf-cherry, <HI>(Cera&s;us pumila),</HI> grows wild every where, and &s;hews, that the &s;oil is fit for any production that can be expected from a temperate clime.</P>
<P>There are no other manufactories in this province than a bad hat, and a gla&s;s, manufactory, &s;ome few tanneries, two brandy-di&s;tilleries belonging to the crown, and the iron-manufactories that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>The game here, is not of any great moment: two &s;orts of martens are caught and &s;ome bad wolves and foxes. When the Kirgue&s;e are peaceable, &s;port&s;men go, with the leave of the commanding officers of their &s;tep, and return loaded with the &s;kins of ground-foxes, wolves, beavers and otters. In the &s;tep of I&s;et&s;koi, they catch plenty of ermines of a fine &s;ize, and, during my &s;lay here, the Tartars caught a &s;able, not far from T&s;cheljabyn&s;kaja, which they looked upon as a great rarity.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, there is plenty of water-game, and, in winter, a great abundance of wood-cocks and wild-gee&s;e. The mountains produce noble birds of prey, a fine &s;pecies of falcons and &s;parrow-hawks. In the
<PB N="174" REF="179">
woods about the I&s;et, we meet, &s;ometimes a &s;pecies of &s;parrow-hawk, <HI>(Falco palumbarius),</HI> which grows quite white when old and is much prettier and larger than the common ones.</P>
<P>On account of the numberle&s;s lakes, here are va&s;t quantities of fi&s;h; the common &s;ort are &s;old from twenty-five to thirty-five copecs <HI>per</HI> pud. If the bot|toms of the lakes are &s;andy, the place is crowded with the <HI>Cypr. Idbarus,</HI> which are cheaper &s;till. They catch now and then a kind of Siberian trout, but they have neither bream nor crabs, though they are found in great plenty in the Jaik, almo&s;t up to it's &s;ource.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit &s;peaking of the air, which about the mountains is wonderfully healthy, and it's inhabitants live to a great age. Many countrymen are here met with, 100 years old, and I &s;aw a &s;oldier, at Troizkoi, who was 120; but the low part of the province, among the &s;alt mora&s;&s;es and foul lakes, is &s;ubject to fevers and &s;corbutic di&s;orders; not &s;o much, however, as to &s;horten the life of the inhabitants. The bitter &s;alt-du&s;t, di&s;per&s;ed by the wind, cau&s;es great inflammations of the eyes and boils upon the eye-lids, and, in this di&s;|trict, the air-plague rages very much among hor&s;es and de&s;troys many, but does not in&s;ect the people.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t week of March, we had a continual thaw and the air was &s;o mild, that on the 24th, (Holy
<PB N="175" REF="180">
Thur&s;day), many of the common people, bathed them|&s;elves, (according to an old cu&s;tom derived from &s;lavi&s;h heatheni&s;m), in the river, though covered &s;till with ice. They &s;ay, that, in former times, this was the fea&s;t of <HI>Kupal,</HI> the god of waters. So, on the Thur&s;day before Whit-&s;unday, the country la&s;&s;es ho|nour, even now, with poetical &s;ongs and garlands, <HI>Lada,</HI> the ancient godde&s;s of love, and her &s;on <HI>Dida,</HI> their fea&s;t having been celebrated on that day, in the times of heatheni&s;m. From the 24th to the 27th, fell a great deal of &s;now, but, directly after, the weather became &s;o warm, that the Mja&s;s was freed from the ice by the end of the month and over-flowed it's banks. On the 7th of April, the waters &s;unk and I thought proper to proceed on my journey, before the &s;now from the mountains &s;welled the rivers again. Several wan|dering birds appeared on the 19th of March, &s;uch as jackdaws and cranes, and &s;oon after, to the 24th, &s;wans and all &s;orts of ducks; and the&s;e, after the la&s;t &s;now on the 28th of March, were followed by gee&s;e, &s;tarlings, larks and many wood and water-fowl. On the 4th of April, came the cuckow, al&s;o a &s;pecies of buntling, and a bird called <HI>Fringilla calcarata,</HI> which runs about the fields in numbers, and is no where &s;een but in Siberia. On the 14th of April appeared the fir&s;t in&s;ects.</P>
<P>On the 16th, I left T&s;cheljabyn&s;kaja, which is a fort that was erected again&s;t the troubles among the Ba&s;ki|rians
<PB N="176" REF="181">
and Kirgue&s;e. The place is fortified in the u&s;ual mode with timber-works, and it's &s;treets are regular; it is &s;ituated on the &s;leep and rocky bank of the river Mja&s;s, has a &s;tone-built and a wooden church, and many good public and private buildings. Mo&s;t of the dwelling hou&s;es are built in the country &s;tile, and the occupation of mo&s;t of the inhabitants is hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>The night before our departure, on the north &s;ide of the river, I &s;aw the whole horizon in fire, owing to the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p which had been burning three days; and, had not a heavy rain quenched the flames, the town would have been in danger, as the wind blew right towards the &s;uburbs. Such &s;tep-fires are very often &s;een in the&s;e di&s;tricts the whole latter half of April.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night we lay out on the field, but, at the next port we reached, we heard they had lo&s;t &s;everal hor&s;es, and examining them the people told me, they di&s;covered a deep-&s;eated boil on their buttocks, hidden under the &s;kin, in which there was a &s;hort worm, as thick as one's finger. They de&s;cribed this worm as too large for one to &s;uppo&s;e it to be the Swedi&s;h <HI>Curculio par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">plecticus,</HI> yet the circum&s;tances, that cau&s;ed the boil, were here the very &s;ame.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we cro&s;&s;ed the river Mja&s;s with our hor&s;es, I continued my journey along it, where are a number of villages, but the road &s;truck off through a hilly

di&s;trict. Our eyes were charmed the whole day with the Siberian wind-flower, <HI>(Anemone patens),</HI> that grew every where, where the lands were not very &s;alt. It is here and throughout Siberia called <HI>Wetriniza,</HI> (wind-flower), and is well known by the countryman, as the young pea&s;ants often rai&s;e fal&s;e boils on &s;everal parts of their bodies, with the brui&s;ed herb of this flower, in order to be declared incapable of military &s;ervice, when there is any pre&s;s or levying of &s;oldiers. In want of this herb, they make u&s;e of a kind of &s;harp garlick, which will rai&s;e boils, but which are readily cured again, by covering them with wax. The pea&s;ants al&s;o u&s;e a decoction of the wind-flower, again&s;t all convul|&s;ive complaints of their children. The fields were al&s;o embelli&s;hed with the phea&s;ants-eye, <HI>(Adonis Apennina),</HI> and the <HI>Adonis verna,</HI> which blooms &s;ooner. Both &s;pe|cies here go by the &s;ame name. They pre&s;erve the roots as the mo&s;t important of all dome&s;tic remedies; and petulant girls u&s;e it occa&s;ionally by way of revenge to bring on mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>In my way on I cro&s;&s;ed, on the 21&s;t of April, the river Kurtamy&s;ch, on the banks of which, &s;tands the market-town Kurtamy&s;ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fkaja, on an open, &s;andy hill, round which, the river makes an exten&s;ive bend. This town was erected twenty years ago, with all the villages that belong to it. It has a commi&s;&s;ioner and a town-hou&s;e, &s;ubordinate to the regency of I&s;et&s;koi, and to it's juri&s;diction belong twenty-four villages,

&s;ituated on this river and on &s;ome little lakes, con&s;i&s;t|ing of 1850 men, the market-town Talof&s;kaja, with it's dependency, 2365 men, and Kamin&s;kaja 1935 men, the la&s;t two add 243 noble families, &s;o that the male inhabitants of this whole di&s;trict amount to 6393. This place, be&s;ides the town-hou&s;e and a wooden church, has only &s;ixty-eight dwelling-hou&s;es. Before the line of Ui was erected, this was a fort, and it is &s;till &s;ur|rounded with the old works. The di&s;trict is not very good for hu&s;bandry, on account of the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;oil, the be&s;t &s;oil growing barren every three or four years, and wheat never thriving here at all. Former|ly, here were a great many elks in the hilly woods, but they have de&s;erted the place &s;ince it has been inhabited. They catch, however, a great many ermine, foxes, &amp;c. &s;ometime the race-hare, <HI>(jaculus),</HI> and &s;ometimes &s;tags, that wander here from the Kirgui&s;ian &s;tep.</P>
<P>The low-lands, are abundantly covered with a ni|trous &s;alt, which lies over the moi&s;t ground, puffed up like foam. It contains a mixture of glauber-&s;alt and &s;o much alkali, that it efferve&s;ces with acids. In general, all the &s;alt-tracts here are &s;o impregnated with a bitter and common &s;alt, proportionably nitrous, that it may be &s;queezed from the ground in &s;pring, in form of a &s;pungy, very moi&s;t, white paper foam, which in long, dry weather breaks down into a &s;now-white flour. The cattle gather round this &s;alt in great quan|tities, yet will eat but little of it, it having a urinous ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="184">Having &s;ent on my waggons to Kamin&s;kaja, when I had examined this &s;alty di&s;trict &s;ufficiently, I followed them, and was there on the 22d of April. This place con&s;i&s;ts of 130 hou&s;es of &s;ub&s;tantial families, and lies on an arm of the Tobol, which abounds with all &s;orts of fi&s;h, particularly barbel and roach, which are often near 18 inches long. In winter, this place is very watry and abounds with water-fowl, particularly large, white cranes, of which further mention &s;hall be made. With all other &s;orts of game the country abounds, and is rich even in elks and wild boars. Ducks are here taken flying, in &s;uch nets as I de&s;cribed were erected in other parts to catch gee&s;e, and they al&s;o make &s;nares of hor&s;e-hair, fa&s;tened in rows on a rope extended over the &s;urface of the waters, in which ducks and other water-fowl are abundantly caught. The country-folks here, by a &s;trange &s;uper&s;tition, incen&s;e the&s;e &s;nares with the curled galls, that form them&s;elves on worm|wood and &s;outhernwood, idly conceiving that it will prevent evil eyes bewitching the &s;nares.</P>
<P>I &s;at out from this place in order to cro&s;s the Tobol, at twenty-&s;ix miles di&s;tance, but found that a &s;torm, the day before I arrived, had &s;unk the ferry-boat and they had only a &s;light raft, much too &s;light to carry my two heavy waggons; be&s;ides, I met with a party, on my way, of 500 dragoons, which were marching again&s;t the Kirgue&s;e, who had lately committed &s;everal robberies and &s;eized &s;ome travellers, and as I could not
<PB N="180" REF="185">
get a &s;ufficient e&s;cort at this place to pa&s;s &s;afely, I re|turned to this, determining to proceed by another route. But, to add to my mortification, one of the gentlemen with me, Mr. <HI>Sokolof,</HI> was attacked with an ague; my draft&s;man, who had &s;unk into a lowne&s;s of &s;pirits &s;ome months pa&s;t, was now wor&s;e, and an atten|dant, who had been afflicted with the &s;curvy, all the winter, fell &s;ick, and another had been thrown from a wild, Kirgui&s;ian hor&s;e, and lay in a very &s;hocking and &s;hattered condition; I could proceed only, therefore, in that &s;low way which the &s;tate of my patients would admit.</P>
<P>On the 25th of April, I proceeded down the Tobol and picked up, in my way, a &s;pecies of a little, grey dormou&s;e, with a black &s;tripe on it's back, and a very long tail, <HI>(mus &s;ubtilis),</HI> very common in the birch|woods, near this place. This little animal falls a&s;leep in the lea&s;t cold, and creeps into &s;mall chinks of the earth or holes in the ground, where it rolls it&s;elf up like a ball, till enlivened again by the warmth.</P>
<P>On the night of the 27th, we had a &s;harp fro&s;t, &s;o as to freeze the water, and yet the flowers and flower|buds &s;tood it well; for the plants in this climate agree well with it's different changes of weather. Down|wards, along the Tobol, there are many villages, and the di&s;trict is as much inhabited as the mo&s;t populous di&s;trict in all Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="186">About fifty miles below Kamin&s;kaja, on the river Tobol, is &s;ituated the hill called Larew-Kurgan, a hill of an enormous height, rai&s;ed by hand. But no cer|tain tradition has been left of it. It appears doubtful whether it is not a monument of &s;ome extraordinary event, or the tumulus of &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction, erected by the ancient inhabitants of this di&s;trict. The circumference of the hill is 480 feet, and is at &s;ixteen feet di&s;tance encompa&s;&s;ed with an over-grown, circular bank, ten feet and a half high, and a ditch, which, in it's whole circuit, mea&s;ures 700 feet. The form of this hill was conical, pointed at top, and was higher than at pre&s;ent, but a certain prince cau&s;ed the top to be taken off and a deep pit to be dug into it, in order to di&s;cover it's contents; nothing, however, was found. The whole hill is richly covered with gra&s;s and &s;tands near a village, where they are erecting a &s;tone|church, but as they are obliged to fetch their mortar a great way, it goes but &s;lowly on. The inhabitants have here begun to erect their ovens with brick in&s;tead of tho&s;e which they u&s;ed to build with clay, and which &s;o often fired their malt-kilns. The ovens they now build are well vaulted, with vent-holes on the &s;ides, ju&s;t underneath the roof, and a chimney clo&s;ed at top, having a &s;moke-hole on each &s;ide. Through the&s;e &s;moke-holes no &s;park can get, &s;o as to &s;et fire to the &s;traw &s;pread about it, and the whole kiln is thus pre|&s;erved from taking fire, owing to the chimney's being clo&s;ed at top.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="187">On the fir&s;t of May, my patients being better, I cro&s;&s;ed the river Ik, which is here 105 feet over, and deep.
<Q>The villages are &s;mall, but &s;tand, in this coun|try, very thick, and a commi&s;&s;ioner, who re&s;ides in one of them, has the command of twenty or more according to their &s;ituation. They &s;ow here a great deal of rye, wheat, oats and millet, which is bought up by commi&s;&s;ioners from the crown, and carried a|way in barges, in &s;ummer-time, and on &s;ledges in winter.</Q>
On the night of the 2d. we had a violent &s;torm, accompanied with a fall of &s;now, which covered the ground a foot thick, and interrupted my journey, till the next day. We had &s;carce travelled twenty-three miles further, but my attendant, who was &s;o ill with the &s;curvy, grew wor&s;e. The great fro&s;t had done him harm, and this added to clande&s;tine intem|perance, carried him off, with a mortification in his bowels. I gave him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, but it was all in vain, he expired on the 3d of May, when he little expected it. I left &s;ome of my people to bury him, and continued my journey the &s;ame afternoon.</P>
<P>Thirty miles lower down the Tobol, is a con&s;ider|able brandy-di&s;tillery, erected twenty years &s;ince, by two merchants, but belonging now to Count <HI>Schuwalof.</HI> Above three hundred hou&s;es are here built along the Uk, which empties it&s;elf into the Tobol, and there is a fine wooden church and man&s;ion for the direc|tor, with a garden, 'compting-hou&s;e and &s;tore-hou&s;es.

Each tub contains ten t&s;chetwerts of malt, mixed with a fifth or &s;eventh part of oats or bar|ley. The common coppers contain forty-two Ru&s;&s;ian gallons each, and are all filled with the wa&s;h of one tub, and the&s;e di&s;tillations come round in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion once in four days, of cour&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on with|out interruption;

Near each di&s;tillery is a large copper, from which the hot water is led by pipes into the tubs; and here are granaries and a large malt-kiln. They di&s;till here from 30 to 40,000 t&s;chetwerts of malt, which is conveyed here in winter, and from each t&s;chet|wert, they draw three or four gallons of Ru&s;s brandy or &s;pirits, which always goes through a &s;econd di&s;tillation.

<P>The people whom I left to bury their fellow-travel|ler, joined me on the 5th of May, and we &s;at off the following day together, early in the morning, and after travelling 225 miles pa&s;t many villages, that contained nothing more remarkable than what I had &s;een before, and many tumuli. I found my&s;elf in a di&s;trict of the I&s;chimian &s;tep, full of uncommon large lakes, and, therefore, abounding with water-fowl, and particularly that large &s;pecies of white cranes, of which I was de&s;i|rous of knowing &s;ome particulars. I re&s;olved, there|fore, to &s;tay a couple of days in this place, Krataja, and to &s;end out for &s;ome of the&s;e birds. One of the lakes in this &s;tep is twenty-two miles long, and &s;even miles broad. All of them are very full of fi&s;h and feed great quantities of water-fowl, which, as the inhabi|tants are thin, build their ne&s;ts here in tolerable &s;afety. About one of the&s;e lakes, called <HI>Mangut,</HI> which is almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, on account of it's &s;wamps, are many wild boars, and about the lake Saltaim have been built, within the&s;e ten years, &s;everal villages, colo|nized
<PB N="185" REF="190">
by per&s;ons who have been tran&s;ported into Sibe|ria for little mi&s;demeanours.</P>
<P>On the 11th, the per&s;ons I &s;ent to bring me &s;ome of tho&s;e white cranes, returned with &s;everal, <HI>(Grus Leuco|geranus).</HI> It was with difficulty they could get them to &s;tand &s;o as to have a &s;hot at them, for the&s;e birds are much more cautious than other cranes, and if they once &s;ee a man, even at the greate&s;t di&s;tance, &s;oar up into the air with a mu&s;ic equal to that of the &s;wan. Their height, &s;tanding upright, is five feet, and this enables them to &s;ee a great way, and they are &s;o timid as to &s;u&s;pect every, the lea&s;t, motion of a reed. It is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary that a gunner &s;hould approach them quite covered, whil&s;t they are feeding on &s;mall fi&s;hes on the banks of the lakes, which is their cu&s;to|mary food. Timid as they are before men, they are bold enough again&s;t dogs, whom, as &s;oon as they &s;ee, they will attack with great fury forgetting the lurking &s;port&s;man, who is with them. If any man approaches their ne&s;ts, they are equally bold, will never fly, but protect their abode to the la&s;t, and, on account of their large &s;ize and the &s;harpne&s;s of their bills, are formidable enemies. They build their ne&s;ts in &s;olitary, ru&s;hy mo|ra&s;&s;es and fens, on hillocks of &s;ea-weed and twi&s;ted ru&s;hes. The male and female guard the ne&s;t by turns. They lay but two eggs, which are as large as a goo&s;e-egg and &s;potted with yellow, green and brown. This was ju&s;t the &s;ea&s;on of their breeding. In one year's
<PB N="186" REF="191">
time, the young crane is almo&s;t as large as the old one, and his body is covered with ochre-yellow feathers, whiter under the belly and about the head, and his bill is blacki&s;h. In the &s;econd year, he becomes white and keeps only the outermo&s;t wing-feathers; the head grows red above the eyes, where there are no feathers, but only &s;mall, red hairs. At this time, the bill-&s;kin and feet are red. and the neck continues yellow, but deeper and more firy, which, as the bird grows older, becomes white as a &s;wan. This bird flies from over the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, in the &s;pring of the year, commonly &s;ingle and very high in the air, but is no where &s;o fre|quently to be met with as are the common cranes.</P>
<P>The next thing I enquired for, was the flying &s;quir|rel, and &s;ent &s;ome hunters abroad into the birch-woods in &s;earch of &s;ome. This wonderful little animal, <HI>(Sciurus volans),</HI> is common from the Uralian moun|tains, throughout all northern A&s;ia or Siberia, where there are any birch-woods, with or without firs; is al|ways &s;een on high and builds it's ne&s;ts in the trunks of trees, from whence it does not go out but at twilight or night, to feed upon the birches, it's food being the fruit that grows upon the birch, &s;mall and brown in winter, blooming in &s;pring and filled with &s;eeds in &s;um|mer, thus &s;erving as aliment to this animal through|out the whole year. Where there are fir trees, it eats their buds and it's entrails have, then, a very re&s;inous &s;mell; but, otherwi&s;e, they have a birch-&s;mell. It
<PB N="187" REF="192">
&s;eldom runs upon the ground, and yet is in the habit of dropping it's dung at the bottom of tho&s;e trees where it lives. When it leaps from one tree to another, it &s;preads out the &s;olds of it's fur, with all it's feet, which from the fore-feet to the ham, may be extended on both &s;ides by a bone, like wings, with which it will quiver in the air, &s;omething like flying, and can direct it&s;elf in it's flight by it's woolly and broad tail. In this manner it will fly or leap to the di&s;tance of 140 feet, not horizontally, but in an oblique direction downwards from the top of one tree to the middle or trunk of an|other. When it climbs the birch-tree, it is &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable, by it's white-grey colour, from the bark of the&s;e trees; thus has Nature wi&s;ely protected this animal from nocturnal birds of prey. This is the &s;ea&s;on in which the flying &s;quirrel drops it's young; they commonly bring forth only two, &s;ometimes three and but rarely four: they are fir&s;t callow and blind. I kept a ne&s;t, that was brought me, a long time. The mother &s;at the whole day over her young ones, and wrapped them up in her wing-&s;kin; but at night, as &s;oon as the &s;un was &s;et, &s;he covered them with mo&s;s and went to &s;earch her food. The young ones grew very &s;lowly, and did not get their hair and fore-teeth till after the &s;pace of &s;ix days. They remained blind to the thirteenth day, when I found them all dead, and one almo&s;t devoured by the mother. If the&s;e animals, when brought to me, were but two days old, and, by their &s;ize, they appeared to be of that age, they mu&s;t
<PB N="188" REF="193">
remain blind for a fortnight after their birth, which is not the ca&s;e with any quadruped we know as yet. The mother died &s;oon after, notwith&s;tanding all attempts were made to &s;ave the little creature's life. I might have had better &s;ucce&s;s in winter, but then it is hard to catch them. They often fall into tho&s;e brui&s;ing traps, &s;et on trees to catch &s;quirrels with.</P>
<P>On the 15th of May, the heat of the weather was equal to 105 deg. and a half of <HI>De L'I&s;le's</HI> thermome|ter, had encrea&s;ed one deg. and a half within the la&s;t three days, and was attended with a violently hot, &s;outhern &s;torm, that blew hard and carried with it a great deal of &s;alt-du&s;t, which hurt our eyes much. Towards night, we heard a great bu&s;tling and the noi&s;e of a va&s;t quantity of water-fowl, &s;uch as &s;wans, ducks, herons, divers, &amp;c. which continued till midnight. This was the &s;econd progno&s;tication we had, by aquatic mu&s;ic, of an approaching fro&s;t; for, after twelve o'clock at night, the wind changed to the north, and blew all the next day &s;o cold, that we were obliged to look for our furs; yet, we found in bloom, the oalerian <HI>(Valeriana officinalis),</HI> the chichling vetch, <HI>(Lathyrus pi&s;i&s;ormis),</HI> the &s;ky-&s;lower, <HI>(Cineraria, palu&s;tris &amp; Alpi|na),</HI> and &s;everal little bell-flowers; and, the more &s;outhward we travelled, the more plants we met with in bloom.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="194">Having given no de&s;cription of a particular way of catching &s;turgeon, in the river Wolga, with a tackling they call <HI>&s;na&s;t;</HI> as I met with the &s;ame here, in the river Irti&s;h, under the name of <HI>&s;amolowi,</HI> &s;omewhat different from the &s;na&s;t of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, the reader &s;hall have it now. The whole con&s;i&s;ts of a ba&s;t rope, well tarred, between twenty and forty fathoms long, on which they fa&s;ten, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix inches from each other, if for &s;mall fi&s;h; but at twelve inches, if for large fi&s;h, &s;mall cords, likewi&s;e be&s;meared with tar; on the&s;e &s;trings, they tie &s;trong and &s;harp hooks, four or five inches long, grea&s;ed with tallow to prevent ru&s;t; in the middle of the curve of the&s;e hooks, is a line of hor&s;e|hair, twi&s;ted, having a &s;mall float at it's end, of willow|bark, as light as cork. After each tenth hook, they fa&s;ten a &s;tone on the la&s;t rope, &s;ufficient to &s;ink it, and, at one end, a wooden anchor to &s;ecure the whole, at the other, a rope with a ba&s;ket, or &s;ome other thing that will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;erve as a buoy. In this &s;tate, the tackling is ca&s;t into deep places in the &s;tream, let|ting the anchor fir&s;t down, that the current may not carry it off. By means of the floats to each hook, the hooks are kept from touching the bottom, and the &s;turgeon and hu&s;os, which rove about the bottom, beating the water with their flanks and tails, are &s;ure to hook them&s;elves in one part or other: &s;o wounded, they are more agitated, beat and la&s;h the water more, and are, by this means, hooked in &s;everal other parts, &s;o as not to be able to e&s;cape.

<P>On my arrival at Om&s;kaja, a fort on the river Irti&s;h, on the 17th of May, I went to Major <HI>Stani&s;la&s;ky's,</HI> to &s;ee &s;ome maps that had been made of Siberia, convin|ced there were &s;uch things in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, left by the late General <HI>Springer,</HI> who died ju&s;t before we arrived, and who was a lover of the &s;cience of geography. Af|ter waiting two days I was informed, that, without &s;pe|cial orders from Peter&s;burgh, I could not be &s;hewn any of them. Notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay, I could not get a &s;ight of tho&s;e which I wanted to &s;ee, and from
<PB N="191" REF="196">
this I collected that the commanders here di&s;liked my tour and the bu&s;ine&s;s I was entru&s;ted with. Indeed, till the day of my departure, I could obtain nothing but an order for a change of hor&s;es at different places, and the&s;e, the wor&s;t in the garri&s;on; and, in this order, they left it to the option of tho&s;e officers who com|manded the forts I was to travel through, whether they would &s;upply me with regimental hor&s;es or not. I dreaded, therefore, every po&s;&s;ible ob&s;tacle, and this cold and ungentleman-like reception the more &s;urprized me, as I had been, every where el&s;e, loaded with all imaginable civility and kindne&s;s, by the governors and commanding-officers where I pa&s;&s;ed. I con&s;idered this, however, as a new proof of the old truth, that the God of War is no friend to the Mu&s;es.</P>
<P>I remained, however, at Om&s;kaja, to repair and re|fit till the 22d. Om&s;kaja has it's name from the river Om, being &s;ituated near it's mouth into the Irti&s;h. A new fort has been here erected by Lieutenant-General <HI>Springer,</HI> the old one having been entirely decayed, and is well fortified, according to the rules of modern for|tification. It was begun in 1768, and in great for|wardne&s;s when I was there. Within it, is a hand&s;ome man&s;ion for the governor, with a &s;tone foundation; a court-martial and a military &s;tore-hou&s;e, with artillery; a hou&s;e for the chief prie&s;t, and &s;everal &s;treets of well|built hou&s;es; a fine &s;tone-built church, a military-aca|demy, a hou&s;e for the reception of &s;trangers of di&s;tinc|tion

and one for the prote&s;tant preacher of the Siberian divi&s;ion, be&s;ides other hou&s;es for officers, &amp;c. On the Irti&s;h lies, within the fort, the magazine of provi&s;ions, and, in the chief &s;quare of the fort, are &s;everal fine fountains. In &s;hort, it has the appearance of a fine city. Part of the old fort will be demoli&s;hed with the old cathedral and the church-yard only left, where a monument has been erected to General <HI>Springer.</HI></P>
<P>Forty miles from Om&s;kaja, where I arrived on the 23d of May, is a guard &s;tation, where a new fort is built, and the place is colonized with a number of ex|iled Tartars, &s;ent here to carry on the works at Om|&s;kaja. Near this po&s;t, an Engli&s;h officer, who former|ly commanded here, has made a fine kitchen-garden. The &s;and, taken out from the ditch of the redoubt, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed with <HI>Tellin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> mu&s;cles, half calcined, often met with on the higher &s;hores of the Irti&s;h, but never in the river it&s;elf, and are inconte&s;tably a marine production. Put the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance is, there being only this &s;ingle &s;pecies of mu&s;cle-&s;hells, to be found throughout the &s;andy &s;teps upon the Irti&s;h, without any other trace of petrified &s;ea-bodies; and, it is no le&s;s worthy the notice of a naturali&s;t, that they are found abundantly, quite near the &s;urface of the earth, whil&s;t the borders of the river, which con&s;i&s;t of &s;and and loam, and the other &s;teps, wherein they are found, are &s;ix, eight, my even ten fathoms above the highe&s;t le|vel of the water.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="198">I never met, any where, with &s;o great a number of water-&s;wallows, as about the high-&s;hores of the Irti&s;ch. In many places their holes and ne&s;ts are &s;o near each other, that if one &s;tands on the brink of the &s;hore and treads a little hard, they will &s;warm out in crowds and hover about like flies. Here, al&s;o, builds the hou&s;e-&s;wallow her ne&s;t, with the water-&s;wallow. The former makes a hole in the land, but not &s;o deep as the latter. The hou&s;e-&s;wallow's hole is merely large enough for ner ne&s;t. The&s;e two &s;pecies of &s;wallows, are found here in abundance, but they do not like to mix. One &s;pot &s;hall be found full of the ne&s;ts of the water-&s;wal|low and another of the hou&s;e-&s;wallow.</P>
<P>In our way from Om&s;kaja, we pa&s;&s;ed many &s;cattered tumuli, about ninety miles from that place; the&s;e tu|muli are not rai&s;ed &s;o high as in general; they are flat and of mean appearance, and the body not buried more than eighteen or twenty inches deep: the bones, how|ever, that we found, were quite &s;ound. The head lies to the we&s;t and they are, probably, the graves of the idolatrous Barabynian Tartars. Valuable things are not commonly found herein, but, in &s;ome, they have found copper, and in &s;ome few, better metals.</P>
<P>The high, &s;andy &s;hores of the Irti&s;ch, which are mixed with loam, lie mo&s;tly in layers and &s;eem to have been carried there by the deluge. One layer, near eight fathoms, or more, above the highe&s;t water|mark,
<PB N="194" REF="199">
is mixed with the tellinae I have mentioned. Mo&s;t of them are calcined, but have pre&s;erved &s;ome|thing of their outward, horn-like, upper-&s;kin. The&s;e very layers, in which the mu&s;cles are di&s;per&s;ed, contain all &s;orts of bones, &s;ome of elephants and &s;ome of other animals, nay, even the bones of fi&s;h-heads; of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t have been brought hither by &s;ome va&s;t inun|dation; or it is a proof that the &s;ea, formerly, &s;tretched it&s;elf entirely over the&s;e plains. It is not the river, that cau&s;es here &s;uch great &s;inkings or excavations of the ground, as we meet with, but &s;trong, &s;ubterranean &s;prings, that gu&s;h forth in inconceivable &s;treams, from underneath the high, &s;andy layers, and from a grey clay, that does not lie much higher than the level of the water. The&s;e &s;treams are of a bracki&s;h ta&s;te, and it leads me to think they mu&s;t proceed from the great lake I have mentioned. Indeed it is very dangerous to travel over many &s;pots of the low-&s;hore, as one often &s;inks &s;uddenly into a bottomle&s;s &s;wamp.</P>
<P>Between thirty and forty miles from the Irti&s;ch, are three large &s;alt-lakes, where the pure&s;t and fine&s;t com|mon &s;alt lies at the bottom of the whole lakes, a foot in thickne&s;s; but, in le&s;s quantity near the &s;hore. The large&s;t of the&s;e lakes, is about two miles long and a|bout 450 fathoms over; in &s;erene weather, the water has a blood-red appearance, though it is perfectly tran&s;parent. A guard of Tartarian Co&s;&s;acks is placed here, to prevent the &s;alt being taken away to the in|jury

of the revenue, and have habitations adjoining them. Here I met with, in the wet low-lands, a weed called the <HI>Acorus,</HI> which is dug up by travellers, in or|der to pre&s;erve furs from the moth, and which they a&s;&s;ured me was very efficacious.</P>
<P>Travelling on by the Irti&s;ch, I met with more ele|phant-bones and a &s;houlder-bone, which &s;eemed to belong to a buffalo; al&s;o, &s;ome large, animal &s;kulls, of which there is now no animal &s;o large in all A&s;ia. I pa&s;&s;ed over a &s;tep, where a number of hor&s;es lay a|bout dead, which died of the air-plague. They lay in &s;uch numbers as to re&s;emble a field of battle.</P>
<P>In the fort Korjakofskoi, which is one of the mo&s;t populous on the Irti&s;ch and the be&s;t built, commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel, are two &s;alt-magazines, be|longing to the crown, and always containing a provi&s;i|on of &s;ome hundred thou&s;ands puds of &s;alt, for a &s;upply in ca&s;e of want. The&s;e &s;tores lay in large heaps, co|vered with mats, ready for tran&s;portation, in barges to the Irti&s;ch, which lies at the di&s;tance of about &s;ixteen miles. Each barge will carry from 17 to 18,000 puds, and down the Irti&s;ch it is conveyed to the Imperial &s;alt-office, not far from Tobol&s;kaja.</P>
<P>If it was not for &s;everal plants that grow on the&s;e &s;andy &s;teps, &s;uch as the <HI>Axyris ceratoides,</HI> the Siberian centaury and the wonderful wild liquorice, <HI>(A&s;tralagus)</HI>

the &s;and would not be &s;ufficiently &s;olid to pa&s;s over: but this a&s;tralagus grows between the &s;and-hills, creep|ing with numberle&s;s thin, divided twigs, through the &s;and, gathering it&s;elf round it and thus forming hil|locks, from four to &s;ix feet in diameter; the &s;mall, grey leaves of this plant covering the &s;and entirely. The bloom &s;carce ri&s;es above the ground, but it is di|rectly covered with &s;and and the little cods, that hold the &s;eed, ripen under the &s;and.

near the road and &s;tarting before us a breeding duck; this animal looked at us a little while, with a great deal of phlegm, without being in the lea&s;t di&s;mayed at our noi&s;e; after this, went &s;lowly on behind us, and cro&s;&s;ed the road with equal coolne&s;s.

<P>On the 21&s;t, I was at the &s;ort Semipalatnaja, where Dr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> has de&s;cribed as &s;ituated &s;ome ruins of an|cient buildings.

The fir&s;t is a wretched, quadran|gular hut, 260 fathoms di&s;tant from the others, without windows, built with unburnt bricks, nineteen feet &s;quare, with a very low and narrow gate on the we&s;tern &s;ide, towards the river, and three air-holes on the &s;outh|ern &s;ide. The roof is planks, over&s;pread with loam, and broke in. Of the other two, the walls only are &s;tanding, part of which is built of tho&s;e thin &s;lates of
<PB N="199" REF="204">
which the mountain con&s;i&s;ts, fitted together as well as po&s;&s;ible, and cemented with loam in&s;tead of mortar.</P>
<P>Seven miles from the guard-&s;tation, on the Irti&s;h, is the bartering market, where trade is carried on between the A&s;iatic merchants and the Kirgue&s;e. This place con&s;i&s;ts of a certain number of little, wooden hou&s;es, or booths, divided into &s;everal &s;treets, and encompa&s;&s;ed with a ditch and chevaux-de-frize, and are inhabited, or de&s;tined for &s;tore-hou&s;es, by native Ru&s;&s;ian or Tar|tarian merchants, or &s;uch Bucharians as arrive with caravans. Over the Irti&s;h is a ferry, and on the op|po&s;ite &s;hore are &s;ome huts, erected purpo&s;ely for Kir|gui&s;ian commerce. Mo&s;t of the Bucharians come from Ta&s;chkent, in Little Bucharia; and there were, when I was there, &s;ome caravans with ordinary cotton goods. This people is more ob&s;tinate and uncivilized than tho&s;e from Great Bucharia. The bartering trade carried on with the Kirgue&s;e, is mo&s;t advantageous to the inland merchants, becau&s;e the&s;e Kirgue&s;e, being of the middle horde and living on the Irti&s;h, are very &s;im|ple and take trifles, at a high rate, for their cattle; &s;o that the merchants, notwith&s;tanding their long journey to this place, get a great deal by what they purcha&s;e. The Kirgui&s;ian &s;heep are here of two kinds, a large &s;pecies and a &s;maller one, like tho&s;e of the Kalmucks. Hor&s;es are &s;old here from four to fifteen and twenty ru|bles each, horned cattle, from two to four rubles each, and &s;heep, from thirty to &s;eventy copecs a-piece.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="205">On the 22d I &s;et out, in the afternoon, and our hor&s;es were &s;o bad, that they could &s;carce draw our waggons over the &s;and-hills. It was night when we pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t, at &s;even miles from the fort. Two of the waggons were obliged to &s;top at the fir&s;t &s;and-hill, the hor&s;es being knocked up, whil&s;t I took up my lodging in the woods, and was unable to proceed any further till noon, the next day. The re&s;t of the road to O&s;ernoi Staniz, where I was going, is tolerably le|vel, and we met with nothing worth notice in our way but a tumulus, on which &s;tood a &s;tone with the princi|pal features of a man's face carved on it. It was thir|teen inches broad, fifteen long and four and a half thick.</P>
<P>The many changes of heat and cold which I &s;ubject|ed my&s;elf to, when I left my waggons in order to &s;earch for plants, and the daily cold and &s;tormy &s;how|ers to which I was expo&s;ed, brought on a dy&s;entery and made me &s;o weak, that I could get &s;carce up and down from the waggon; but, as I determined to re&s;t my&s;elf at Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, I made the be&s;t of my way there, and with as much expedition as my painful &s;ituation would admit. It was at the di&s;tance of twenty-&s;even miles, and I got there on the 30th of June. In my road, I pa&s;&s;ed an enormous tumulus, rai&s;ed on the highe&s;t &s;pot of the whole di&s;trict, and was told, it had once been opened by a body of 150 pea&s;ants, and the&s;e diggers of hidden trea&s;ures, found in it no le&s;s than
<PB N="201" REF="206">
forty-&s;ix pounds of gold, which they &s;hared among them.</P>
<P>The gold found in the&s;e graves, the many mines that have been here opened, and the &s;cattered tumuli repre&s;enting the beds of re&s;t of the ancient Teutonic heroes, with the fa&s;hion of their tools, arms and furni|ture found within, puts it beyond a doubt, that the metallic mountains of the Irti&s;h and Jene&s;ei were for|merly worked by one and the &s;ame nation.</P>
<P>Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja was a bad place and a very unfit abode for me, in my di&s;order, to halt at, as the water was unwhole&s;ome and the refracted heat of the adjacent mountains injurious, but I could get no further, and was confined to my bed for three weeks. However, that I might lo&s;e no time, I &s;ent Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> off, in company with my draft&s;man, on the 6th of July, in order to de&s;cribe the di&s;tricts on both &s;ides of the Irti&s;h, with orders to meet me on the &s;erpent-mountain, where I hoped to be able to wait for him.</P>
<P>Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja is a new-erected village, like many others, that have been built &s;ince the year 1764, and colonized partly with Poli&s;h emigrants of Ru&s;&s;ian ex|traction and of the old Greek religion, partly with pea&s;ants from the innermo&s;t parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, or &s;uch who, for little mi&s;deame&s;nors, have been here exiled; partly, al&s;o, with voluntary coloni&s;ts, from the more
<PB N="202" REF="207">
populous parts of Siberia. This village has been erec|ted but three years and has, at pre&s;ent, only twenty hou&s;es; mo&s;t of the inhabitants are exiles, to whom the Empre&s;s has been plea&s;ed to re&s;tore their liberty, and enable them, once more, to enjoy the &s;weets of dome&s;tic life, by peopling this de&s;art part of the world. The clemency and philanthropy of the Mother of this country, has extended &s;o far as to &s;upply the&s;e wretches, like other coloni&s;ts, for the fir&s;t three years, with mo|ney and provi&s;ion, monthly; and &s;uch wi&s;e proceed|ings will, doubtle&s;s, render the&s;e di&s;tricts, in time, as populous as other parts of Siberia. Indeed, mo&s;t of the&s;e new villages are &s;o happily &s;ituated for agricul|ture, that the inhabitants cannot but be pro&s;perous. The only complaint of this and other villages, &s;ituated on the Uba, is the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of it's water, which is apt to cau&s;e fevers, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers, and, as the country folks, here, imprudently nur&s;e &s;uch fevers by a&s;tringents, it brings on lamene&s;s and other nervous effects. And yet the people &s;eem rather di&s;|po&s;ed to u&s;e this water, than &s;earch for good wells. My whole retinue &s;uffered by drinking it. Every man, except one, was afflicted with a fever &s;o irregular, that no remedies could cure it. After we left the place, the di&s;order lurked about them for three weeks.</P>
<P><HI>July,</HI> 17, 1771. We left Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja on the 17th, travelled up the Uba and vi&s;ited the lead|mines, in which is found copper and a &s;mall quantity
<PB N="203" REF="208">
of &s;ilver, and, on the 27th, Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> joined us. He had travelled down the Uba, and brought me an ac|count of a great curio&s;ity, in the di&s;trict of U&s;tkame|nogor&s;kaja, to be &s;een, in the remains of a fortified, Kal|muck Pagoda, which goes by the name of <HI>Ablaikit.</HI></P>
<P>The Pagoda Ablaikit, lies out from the frontiers of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, on the left &s;ide of the Irti&s;ch, in a de&s;art formerly inhabited by the D&s;ungorian Kalmucks, but now by the middle horde of the Kirgue&s;e. The hi&s;tory of it's building, by <HI>Ablai,</HI> a Prince of the Kal|mucks, and it's de&s;truction may be &s;een in a remark|able treati&s;e, written by coun&s;ellor <HI>Muller,</HI> and pub|li&s;hed among the works of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, at Peter&s;burgh, and, al&s;o, in the tour of Mr. <HI>Gmelin.</HI> It is in ruins, but the ruins &s;hew, that all the magnificence of an uncivilized, A&s;iatic people is capable of, has been lavi&s;hed upon it.</P>
<P>After having taken Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI>'s baggage into my waggons, we &s;et off; on the 27th of July for the Serpent-Mountain. We cro&s;&s;ed the river Alei, and came into a deep valley, encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides with &s;teep and rocky mountains a vale delightfully cool and refre&s;h|ing, in arid, &s;ultry weather, enamelled with flowers and frequented by all &s;orts of wild fowl; which renders it, throughout the year, an agreeable place to the neighbouring people, mu&s;t furni&s;h their tables with the
<PB N="204" REF="209">
mo&s;t delicate productions, and afford them comforts which even a prince might envy.</P>
<P>The mountains here are covered with birch and pop|lars, wild ro&s;es and ra&s;berry-bu&s;hes, a fruit the bears are very fond of, and will very often take them from women and children, who go out to gather them, with|out doing them any harm; neither will they, in &s;um|mer, attack any man, unle&s;s much provoked. From the heights of O&s;&s;inowa Gora, we had an awful &s;ight of the &s;teep and rocky, towering clifts of the adjacent mountain, called, in Ru&s;s, <HI>Bjelki,</HI> who&s;e top was co|vered with &s;now, and which may be &s;een at &s;eventy-five miles di&s;tance. This mountain is called the Snow-Mountain, is much torn, and it's a&s;cent &s;o &s;teep, as to have one precipice, or rock-wall, 150 fathoms in per|pendicular height, each fathom &s;even feet Engli&s;h, down which tumbles the river Tigerak, with a tre|mendous roar. This river is, here, fifteen fathoms wide, and prodigiou&s;ly rapid. Before we reach this precipice, which is acce&s;&s;ible only in two places, we de&s;cry, at a di&s;tance, another enormous mountain, who&s;e conical &s;ummit ri&s;es in a &s;tupendous, rocky py|ramid, far above the clouds. The&s;e mountains and their gigantic brethren, appeared now more dreadful, as many gloomy thunder-clouds gathered round their tops and brought on continual rain, till the 2d of Aug. when the &s;ky cleared up.

<P><PB N="205" REF="211">As we rode from the mountain O&s;&s;inowa Gora to the next po&s;t, the open valleys, on our left, exhibited a delightful and unexpected change in the vegetable kingdom. We had not &s;een a remarkable plant for &s;ome time, and all the gra&s;s had lo&s;t it's verdure; but here, the mountains and vallies were covered with a vernal green, like &s;pring, and numberle&s;s planes were in bloom. The mo&s;t remarkable were the fellwort, <HI>(Gentiana verna),</HI> the catmint, <HI>(Nepeta multifida),</HI> the dragon's head, <HI>(Dracocephalum peregrinum),</HI> the bitter vetch, <HI>(Orobus lathyroides),</HI> the French honey-&s;uckle, <HI>(Hedy&s;arum Alpinum),</HI> the liquorice, <HI>(A&s;traga|lus Syriacus),</HI> the John's-wort, <HI>(Hyperycum A&s;cyron),</HI> the rhubarb, <HI>(Rheum undulatum),</HI> which often grows out from the bare clefts of the rock; the milkwort, <HI>(Polygala Sybirica),</HI> and the cinquefoil, <HI>(Potentilla frutico&s;a),</HI> which grew like bu&s;hes, with high rods, and decorated the vallies every where: al&s;o many &s;pe|cies of <HI>Abrotonum,</HI> &s;everal &s;orts of wild leeks and a &s;mall &s;pecies of &s;wordgra&s;s, which <HI>Linnaeus</HI> has taken no notice of; it is a common plant and has very few flowers. Among other plants in this di&s;trict, an ele|gant one and hitherto unknown to botani&s;ts, is the <HI>Spi|rea,</HI> with thick rods, which the Co&s;&s;ack hunters make u&s;e of as ram-rods to their fire-locks.</P>
<P>This di&s;trict was, in every re&s;pect, &s;o very remark|able, that I wi&s;hed to have been here a month &s;ooner, to have climbed up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ountains my&s;elf, which my
<PB N="206" REF="212">
illne&s;s had now rendered me too infirm to do; indeed, I was &s;o weak as not to be able to walk half a mile. I di&s;patched, therefore, Mr. <HI>Sokolof,</HI> with a hunt&s;man and an e&s;cort of Co&s;&s;acks, to the high mountains, and vi&s;ited the lower ones and their caverns my&s;elf, in which I found a number of &s;tone-&s;wallow's-ne&s;ts, <HI>(Hi|rundo alpe&s;tris),</HI> the pellitory <HI>(Parietaria),</HI> and little, &s;tinking figwort <HI>(Scrophularia),</HI> with white blo&s;&s;oms, growing upon the &s;tones. In one cavern, who&s;e en|trance was twenty-&s;ix feet broad and &s;ixteen feet high, &s;omewhat wider in it's continuation, and running 160 feet right into the mountain, I found many human bones and &s;ome few, little trifles carved in wood, per|haps &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious ornaments of the Kalmucks. Here I met with three Kalmuck &s;kulls, and I will de|clare them to be Kalmuck, as from the flatne&s;s of the &s;kull they are di&s;tingui&s;hable from tho&s;e of any other men. The&s;e bodies were, perhaps, here placed by a peculiar order of the prie&s;ts, or &s;ome Kalmucks might have been killed, in this cavern, by accident. On the rock, without, grew plentifully the &s;a&s;ifrage, <HI>(Saxi|fraga cra&s;&s;ifolia),</HI> vulgarly called, there, the Mongali|an tea; for, as the trade with China was, for &s;ome time, interrupted, and the tea, that was imported at Peter&s;burgh and Archangel, too dear, in the&s;e re|mote di&s;tricts; this plant was introduced by the name of T&s;ahagirian tea, and the people learned, from the Mongols and Siberian Tartars, to boil it like common tea. It's leaves do not fade and die in one year, but
<PB N="207" REF="213">
become only dry and brown, afterwards blacki&s;h, and it is four years before they drop off entirely. It gives the water a red tea-colour, with a ta&s;te like that of bad bohea, which, if the plant is not too much boiled, is tolerable; but not &s;o good, that any one would take it in preference to other tea. The fre&s;h leaves, like the roots of this plant, are uncommonly bitter and &s;typtic, of cour&s;e, are not fit to be taken. It is, however, worth trial, whether this plant, which I found anti&s;ep|tic in the highe&s;t degree, is not a good remedy in fe|vers. I am confident it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome medicinal vir|tue. It is found here, on the north &s;ide of all rocky mountains, in va&s;t quantities.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, Mr. <HI>Sokolof</HI> returned from his trouble&s;ome tour, his companion, not knowing his way. They climbed up a mountain covered with larches, firs and pines, and &s;o much bewildered with bu&s;hes, that their cloaths were torn to rags. The mo&s;t curious thing he brought me, was a &s;pecies of &s;tone-hare, <HI>(Lepus Alpinus),</HI> which lives about the rocky brooks of the high mountains, and is common in all the ea&s;tern mountains of Siberia. They are not much larger than a guinea-pig, weigh about fifteen ounces, are of a yellowi&s;h colour, have large, round ears and, in&s;tead of a tail, a little lump of fat. (See the plate and the de&s;cription, at the end of this volume). They inhabit the clefts of rocks; if the weather be &s;oggy, will &s;et the whole day in the open air, but, towards
<PB N="208" REF="214">
night, retire on the out&s;ide of tho&s;e clifts that project from the gra&s;s, and whi&s;tle. They will then &s;uffer a per&s;on to approach them very near, but, if &s;hot at will throw them&s;elves into their clefts, yet appear again, &s;oon after. A wonderful quality of this animal, is their mowing the gra&s;s, after the month of July, with their teeth, and carrying it, as a winter-provi&s;ion of hay, in heaps, into their clefts, &s;o that one may di&s;|cover the dwellings of the&s;e animals by the heaps of gra&s;s on the rocks. This animal reminds me to ob|&s;erve, that though they abound in the wild frontier-mountains, they are almo&s;t lo&s;t within the frontiers, as the country, there, is more populous. For this rea|&s;on, &s;port&s;men, in the favourable &s;ea&s;on for catching them, go, with the leave of the commanding officers, without the frontiers, into de&s;art and woody di&s;tricts, where they find them in plenty. They catch here, al&s;o, a number of fables, who&s;e &s;kins are &s;hort-haired, but very fine and black; and, al&s;o, a great quantity of martens, which, further northward in Siberia, are not to be met with, and are very rare in the upper di&s;trict of the river Jeni&s;ei. Another &s;pecies of little, fore&s;t-animal, who&s;e reddi&s;h fur is but of little value and co&s;ts, here, four or five copecs each, is what they call <HI>Kulonki,</HI> a &s;pecies of wea&s;el not yet de&s;cribed, which is very abundant about the Jeni&s;ei and no where el&s;e to be &s;een, but in the woody di&s;tricts of Siberia. It's name is of Tartarian origin, and implies a glutton, it having been ob&s;erved that this animal, if caught in a &s;nare or
<PB N="209" REF="215">
trap withot her animals, and not &s;oon taken out, will de|vour all that is with it. It &s;teals, like the pole-cat, in|to villages and robs the pea&s;ants of meat, butter and other provi&s;ions. The Co&s;&s;acks quartered here on the lines, catch &s;tags, elks and bears, in covered pits; they al&s;o kill them with fire-arms. They fix the gun upon a fork, cock it, and to the trigger fa&s;ten a &s;tring, which is turned round a peg in the ground behind it, and put acro&s;s the &s;pot where the animal mu&s;t pa&s;s; which if it does, it touches the &s;tring, di&s;charges the piece and &s;hoots it&s;elf. There are, al&s;o, wild boars in the miry di&s;tricts of the high mountains; and abundance of good foxes, lynxes, and &s;quirrels, and along the mountain-waters, otters, and beavers. The &s;tone-rams <HI>(mu&s;imon)</HI> dwell only on the highe&s;t and mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, never feeding in inhabited places. The chamois &s;eems to be wanting here; but probably a few may be found on the mountains, as I received a horn of one from the Jene&s;ei: and on the copper pieces dug out of the tumuli, the figure of the chamois is very common.</P>
<P>It occa&s;ionally happens, that for &s;ome bad trick, and through a love of independence, miners will run from the mines, and dwell a long time in the woody mountains, thriving and growing rich by hunting. Such runaways have been di&s;covered, who have built huts in the wilde&s;t places, without the frontiers. In &s;earch of &s;uch coloni&s;ts, detachments of troops are occa&s;ionally
<PB N="210" REF="216">
&s;ent far into the mountains, where they have found hermits, who, from fanta&s;tic zeal, have left their vil|lages, and &s;ettled in the&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible parts.</P>
<P>It is plainly vi&s;ible that, on chalk mountains, all wild plants become much finer, and more perfect; which may be attributed to the nature of this &s;pecies of rocks, which &s;trongly attracts the moi&s;ture of the air, clouds and fogs, and ab&s;orbs that attracted moi&s;t|ne&s;s &s;o, as not to let the plants have too much wet.</P>
<P>In this di&s;trict I pa&s;&s;ed an old de&s;erted copper-mine, in which &s;ilver was found, that had been worked by <HI>Dimidoff;</HI> and a manufactory adjoining it, the dwell|ings of which were now only inhabited by hu&s;band|men. In my road on, about 54 miles before we reach|ed the &s;erpent-mountain, the banks of the river Alei are covered with wood, in which there are a great many white poplars; and in the banks of the brook Bere|&s;o&s;ka, which falls into the Alei, and which con&s;i&s;t of a kind of loam, and, underneath, layers of &s;and, we found enormous teeth of elephants, and &s;ome remains of &s;maller animals. Some pea&s;ants that rowed down this brook a fi&s;hing, fir&s;t di&s;covered this curio&s;ity; &s;eeing a large tooth of an elephant projecting from the &s;andy banks, they drew it out. I have &s;een a grinder &s;ound here, which &s;eems like the tooth of &s;ome large buffalo; but I cannot give it, by my re|membrance,
<PB N="211" REF="217">
to any known animal, if it be not that of the rhinoceros.</P>
<P><HI>Serpent-mountain.</HI> We reached the &s;erpent-mountain on the 11th of Augu&s;t. It is &s;o called from the innu|merable &s;erpents that were every where crawling about it, till it was covered with mines. I was &s;hewed &s;ome &s;harp, out&s;tanding angles of rocks, in which I &s;aw &s;mooth excavations, as if poli&s;hed, which are &s;aid to have been made by the&s;e &s;erpents, who have now taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a neighbouring mountain. This moun|tain, by name Smejefskaja Gora, de&s;erves ju&s;tly to be called the crown of all Siberian mines; and if it was to be &s;earched into with proper care and exactne&s;s, would take up more time than a traveller would be able to be&s;tow upon it. I &s;hall, however, mention circum|&s;tantially all the accounts and information I could gather re&s;pecting it, and for which I am indebted to its, director, Mr. <HI>Leube.</HI></P>
<P>Before the year 1732, it was known that this moun|tain was metallic; for its old trying pits had been di&s;covered before that time. In 1745, Brigadier <HI>Beier</HI> ordered regular works to be undertaken. Its di&s;tance from the Irti&s;ch is 71 miles; and from the Oby, which flows ea&s;t, and north from it, 107 miles. It is encom|pa&s;&s;ed all round with &s;teep and torn mountains, which form part of the Altai, and between which the brook Korbolicha flows into the Alei; part of the&s;e torn
<PB N="212" REF="218">
mountains con&s;i&s;ts of chalk and &s;tate, and contains &s;ome good ores; yet far inferior in extent and rich|ne&s;s to tho&s;e of the &s;erpent-mountain.</P>
<P>The &s;erpent-mountain is divided from all adjacent ones, by a valley which draws towards the Korbolicha, and ri&s;es to the perpendicular height of 30 fathoms. The whole mountain may be con&s;idered as a great &s;tock covered with &s;lates, which con&s;i&s;t of rich gold, &s;ilver, copper, lead, zinc, ar&s;enic, and &s;ulphur ores. This &s;tock has two divi&s;ions, entirely &s;eparated with|out by a depre&s;&s;ion, or dale, running from north to &s;outh, and within the mountain, by &s;late-rocks, The level part of this &s;tock con&s;i&s;ts of chertz, which, with irregular &s;inu&s;es and &s;helves, runs northward into the depth; but the hanging part of the mountain is a heavy and compact &s;par, over which the &s;late-mountain joins. About the chertz, the ores &s;tick in &s;tocks, ne&s;ts and branches, &s;o that it is commonly encompa&s;&s;ed with a matrix of a richer, and often, nobler alloy than the ores themelves, and a great deal of ma&s;&s;ive me|tals. The chertz in which the ores lie, is, in &s;ub&s;tance, mo&s;tly like a &s;olid fire-&s;tone; its color, expo&s;ed to the air, is yellowi&s;h; further inwards, light grey, or blu|i&s;h. In the neighbourhood of the ores, it is more like metal in large pieces, or ne&s;ts, and impregnated with a &s;ilvery black, or enriched with ma&s;&s;ive gold, or &s;ilver plates. This quartz, chertz, or horn&s;tein, is
<PB N="213" REF="219">
therefore a principal part of the works, and contains a good deal of ar&s;enic.</P>
<P>The &s;par-part is very compact and &s;olid, of a grey or white color, and uncommonly heavy; great part of it is converted into metal, and mixed with &s;everal ores. The &s;late which lies on the &s;par is commonly, at the day, vari-coloured and &s;oft; but in the depth, &s;olid, thoroughly grey, or blacki&s;h. It often contains mar|ca&s;ites, and pebbles of a very aquatic nature; and care is to be taken not to advance very far into it. To this care they owe the depth of the mine, and its being worked with only a few hand-engines.</P>
<P>Betwixt the chertz and the &s;par, in the upper divi|&s;ions, lay &s;ome rich yellow ochre, to the depth of 10 fathoms, and in the lower, 38 fathoms in length, 10 in breadth, and 11 in depth; between which, and the chertz, lay &s;ome white argil, to the thickne&s;s of an ell. In general, the ores from the day to the depth of 20 or 30 fathoms, were the riche&s;t, and mo&s;t ennobled with ma&s;&s;ive metals; but at a greater depth, the ores were poorer, and le&s;s ripe, and very &s;eldom any traces of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver to be met with.</P>
<P>There are many &s;hafts dug in this mine, that have been found very rich with &s;ilver; but the horn&s;tein, or chertz, dug here, is immen&s;ely rich, containing beau|tiful ores in ne&s;ts and bunches, which are of con&s;ider|able

alloy. In the year 1754, they made a great adit which was completed in 1758, and runs to a depth of 32 fathoms, 585 fathoms long, having five air-holes at a proper di&s;tance, and opens with its mouth near the brook in the valley. By means of this adit, which in|ter&s;ects the whole &s;tructure of the mine, all the nu|merous works above it, from which the water was drawn in an expen&s;ive manner with hand-engines, are now not only freed from water, and fre&s;h water pro|cured in the whole mine, but al&s;o the internal quality of the &s;erpent-mountain is &s;till more known, and a road made to the deepe&s;t works. This adit, or road, has gone through 315 fathoms of clay, through 150 fathoms, further on, of reddi&s;h &s;late, then 83 fathoms through chertz, 70 fathoms through &s;par and pebble-ore, five fathoms, of empty &s;par, and la&s;tly through 22 fathoms of a grey and black &s;late; in the whole, 645 fathoms, or 1505 yards.</P>
<P>The works are here carried on with that regularity, &s;kill and order, as may &s;erve as an example to all other mines. The deepe&s;t part of the works cannot be con|tinued in any other manner, than by blowing up the ores with gunpowder; and they u&s;e here annually from 5 to 600 puds of powder for the purpo&s;e; each pud, 36 pounds Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The ores hitherto dug in the&s;e important works, contain an almo&s;t incredible variety of &s;pecies. The
<PB N="215" REF="221">
metals and ores dug throughout the mine, to this time, are as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;&s;ive gold,</HI> which lies mo&s;tly in the upper part of the mountain, from the &s;urface to a depth of 10 fa|thoms, where the ores are the riche&s;t. Its color is high and pure, and it is found in a matrix of chertz, brown ochre, and lazuli; more below, it is very pale, and impregnated with &s;ilver; &s;o that often one and the &s;ame bunch has three, or more &s;orts of color. It is found in irregular grains, and pieces of different, yet &s;mall, &s;ize: &s;ometimes it is impregnated with particles of ar&s;enic. In many &s;ilver-ores, it is &s;o tenderly &s;prinkled in, that it can hardly be di&s;cerned with a magnifying-gla&s;s; yet if it be true that no gold is found changed into ore, it mu&s;t be &s;cattered ma&s;&s;ively in all ores of this mine. Mo&s;t of the ma&s;&s;ive gold is found here vi&s;ibly in the chertz, and the fine &s;and-rock; al&s;o in brown ochre, and rich lazuli: bunches of both the latter have been found underneath the day ores, quite covered with veins of ma&s;&s;ive gold. Ma&s;&s;ive gold is al&s;o here found in veins, and pebble-ores.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver,</HI> which has commonly &s;ome gold in it, is found in pieces and threads of different &s;izes, in kid|ney and clefts. It commonly occurs in chertz, &s;par, different &s;pecies of &s;par-ores, pebble, and &s;ilvery copper|ores; al&s;o, in loam and argyl. The riche&s;t chertz-ores, contain a great deal of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver; and plates of
<PB N="216" REF="222">
the &s;ame have al&s;o been found, in the upper works, upon loam and verdigrea&s;e. The hair-&s;ilver never occurs in very large threads. There are al&s;o black chertz-kidneys, with ma&s;&s;ive, &s;ilver plates in them.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;&s;ive copper,</HI> is in metallic and &s;mall pieces of irregular figure, only in the upper part of the moun|tain. In &s;ome places it lies in white and green loams; in others, in green, &s;ilver, and coppery &s;par-ores, and carries with it a degree of &s;ilver. It is al&s;o dug in tender plates, upon &s;par-ores, ne&s;twi&s;e.</P>
<P>Other ores, dug in this mine, as pebble, ar&s;enic, lead, &amp;c. all contain a degree of &s;ilver, and &s;ome have gold. In an a&s;&s;ay made of 5490 puds of dug ore, there was found 55 puds of black copper, &s;ix puds, nine pounds, and better, of &s;ilver, and upwards of three pounds of gold. Some produce one pound of &s;ilver in 30 pounds of ore; &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s. In the lead-ore a number of beautiful, coloured cry&s;tals are found.</P>
<P>As a curio&s;ity of the &s;erpent-mountain, it de&s;erves to be mentioned, that a piece of a grinder of an elephant, al&s;o a piece of fungites, were found in one of the &s;hafts, which plainly prove its origin from the &s;ea. I &s;aw them both; and I doubt not but other &s;uch re|mains might be found, if properly looked after.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223">The tracts of the ancient workmen, noticed in the&s;e mines, are too remarkable not to be mentioned. The upper and lower divi&s;ion of the ores of this mountain were not known to the&s;e ancient miners. They made deep, trying pits into the &s;oft and rich ochre-ores and clays, &s;ituated near the &s;urface, and made &s;hafts upon them to the depth of five fathoms, and more; but to penetrate into the &s;olid ores, they had neither means, nor tools. Many of their tools have been found in the modern works; &s;everal were ca&s;t in copper, which leads me to think, that iron was un|known to them; and indeed the copper knives, dag|gers and arrows, found in the ancient tombs, in the &s;tep of the Irti&s;ch, is an inconte&s;table proof of it. A few years &s;ince, they found a half metallized &s;keleton of an ancient miner, who was probably &s;queezed to death by the falling in of a &s;haft; about him was a leather bag of the mo&s;t precious ochre. Between the mouth of one of the &s;hafts, and the &s;tamping mills, that formerly &s;tood on the adjoining brook, they found, at the di&s;tance of more than 100 fathoms, one of their wa&s;hing-places, which &s;till contained &s;o much gold, as to make it requi&s;ite to pa&s;s the rubbi&s;h through the modern lavatories, in order not to lo&s;e &s;uch a trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this, we can form a conjecture who the ancient nation, &s;o &s;killed in mineralogy, may have been. The Ru&s;&s;ians, in Siberia, call them
<PB N="218" REF="224">
<HI>T&s;chudaki,</HI> which implies, an old nation. They cannot have been Tartars, or Mongols, becau&s;e the&s;e nations have been acquainted, time out of mind, with the melting of iron, and yet are unacquainted with the melting of copper, or other precious metals; nay even of digging them. Probably this nation might have been driven from their ancient abodes, which they occupied along the Siberian mountains; or may have been de&s;troyed by the wandering Mongols, and Tar|tars. This is probable, from the fine and delightful mountains about the Jeni&s;ei, and from the many magnificent tumuli, in which gold and other valuable things have been di&s;covered. All the tools found about the Jene&s;ei, &s;hew al&s;o more art and &s;plendor, than tho&s;e on the Irti&s;ch, which are clum&s;y and heavy. But no where do we meet with traces of &s;tone-build|ings, or other habitations, which might be attributed to that people, who were probably Nomades, and who&s;e way of life gave the be&s;t opportunity of di&s;covering ores. What then was that nation, &s;o &s;killed in mi|neralogy? Were they the Parthians, lo&s;t in hi&s;tory, or were they the Germans? Their de&s;cendants, perhaps, may think the &s;uppo&s;ition too romantic.</P>
<P>In the old mine-works of the nation I have been &s;peaking of, &s;ome timber has been found, three or four fathoms deep in the ores, quite metallized, and converted into copper, with &s;ilver alloy; and &s;ome that contained little plates, and threads of ma&s;&s;ive copper
<PB N="219" REF="225">
and gold. This &s;erpent-mountain, of all the di&s;|covered mines, has, for the la&s;t 26 years, produced the mo&s;t important trea&s;ures; and the imperial &s;ilver-manufactories on the Ob have been chiefly &s;up|ported by it. As Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> has ob&s;erved, it is the fir&s;t of all Siberian mines, where the ores, to a prodigious depth, have kept con&s;tant. To give the reader a proper idea of the great production of this mine, I &s;hall briefly tell him, that from the year 1749 to 1762, they &s;ent annually from two to four hund|red; and &s;ince 1763, from 5 to 600, nay, even 800 puds of gold and &s;ilver, each pud 36 pounds: and in all, &s;ince the beginning of the &s;ilver-works, above 10,000 puds of raw &s;ilver; which was converted into 318 puds of gold, and above 9000 puds of refined &s;ilver. The tran&s;port of the ores to the manufactories, is done by voluntary waggons, or pea&s;ants, working to pay their poll-tax. The carriage from the &s;erpent-moun|tain to the manufactories, is from five copecs to &s;even, per pud, according to the di&s;tance and badne&s;s of the roads.</P>
<P>On the top of this mountain is a fortre&s;s, to guard it, in form of a polygon, which encompa&s;&s;es the upper works, and extends it&s;elf mo&s;tly over the &s;outh and ea&s;t &s;ides of it; &s;o that the great works, with &s;ome adjacent &s;tore-hou&s;es, forges, and other watering-places, lie without the &s;ortre&s;s, on the we&s;tern &s;ide. The fortre&s;s has two &s;tone-ba&s;tions, on the top of the
<PB N="220" REF="226">
mountain, be&s;ides an earth-wall; with two ba&s;tions in the northern angles, and half a ba&s;tion in the &s;outhern. The principal buildings are, the hou&s;e of the com|manding-officer; that of the chief director; the comp|toir, where a great train of artillery is kept; the new laboratory of a&s;&s;ays, which contains a curious and beautiful collection of ores; a &s;chool-hou&s;e, and an ho&s;pital. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;tore-hou&s;es, maga|zines, and five dwelling-hou&s;es for the officers, &s;everal private hou&s;es, and &s;tables. The foundation of a beautiful, &s;tone-built church, upon a modern plan, is laid; but till the building is completed, they make u&s;e of a timber one. The Smei forms a canal within the walls of the fortre&s;s; its water fills the ditches, and the fortre&s;s it&s;elf, and the &s;uburbs, have &s;everal wells of fine, whole&s;ome water. The &s;uburbs lie on the north and ea&s;t &s;ides of the fortre&s;s, quite down to the valley, and towards the adjacent heights, and are laid out in regular &s;heets, one of which is three quarters of a mile long. The number of hou&s;es amounted to 400; and the place is encrea&s;ing daily.</P>
<P>The direction of the whole mine, is under the cele|brated Colonel <HI>Leube,</HI> who, before the year 1759, was the German preacher of this place. Under him is a captain-director of the works, a ma&s;ter of a&s;&s;ays, &s;everal other officers, and clerks. The miners are, in number, 887; and above 300 more, employed in the lavatories. Several hundred pea&s;ants are con|&s;tantly
<PB N="221" REF="227">
felling timber; and the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of 100 men, commanded by a captain.</P>
<P>As the &s;par, chertz, loam and other rubbi&s;h dug out with the ore, are of a metallic nature, but not of &s;ufficient value to pay the expence of tran&s;porting and melting; there is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the neighbourhood, five &s;tamping-mills and five lavatories, for grinding and wa&s;hing &s;uch ores of &s;mall alloy; and every thing is &s;o contrived that the works are not &s;u&s;pended even in win|ter. To prevent the canals, that work the mills, from freezing, they are covered with &s;prays and hay, and the lavatories are heated by ovens.</P>
<P>The lavatories or wa&s;hing-hou&s;es, produce annual|ly a con&s;iderable quantity of gold-du&s;t, and, &s;ome|times, they find, in the rubbi&s;h, &s;mall pieces of &s;olid &s;ilver. Since 1760, they have produced 160 puds and &s;ix pounds of gold-du&s;t, which is &s;ent to the Imperial Trea&s;ury of Mines, at Catherineburg, and &s;ince the new &s;tamping-mill has been erected, it has produced, in one year, above thirty-&s;even puds extra.</P>
<P>Before I quit this mountain, I will mention two re|markable occurrences&mdash;The one is, that, in the cour&s;e of this year, &s;everal &s;hocks of an earth-quake were here felt; and, the other, that inoculation for the &s;mall|pox introduced in children and adults, was &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully performed here by a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;urgeon, in 1769,
<PB N="222" REF="228">
who&s;e name is <HI>Timofei Andr&eacute;jef,</HI> that out of 469 per&s;ons not a &s;ingle one died. The greate&s;t number was inoculated on the mountain it&s;elf, and the re&s;t in the neighbouring villages. So happy an experiment in Siberia, &s;urely de&s;erves a reward!</P>
<P>I am indebted to Mr. <HI>Leube</HI> for the ob&s;ervations on the earthquake, felt here on the 18th of February of the pre&s;ent year 1771. The motion was like a fluctu|ation of the earth, and pa&s;&s;ed from North to South. On the 17th of February, the night before the earth|quake, the quick&s;ilver of the barometer fell half an inch; during the whole night, a violent &s;outh-wind blew, and at five in the morning fell &s;ome &s;now, to the depth of four inches, and continued on the 18th in the morning, during a great temperature of the air. Then the u&s;ual winter-weather continued to the 22d, the &s;ky was cloudy and the &s;outh and north wind blew by turns; but on the 22d came &s;uch a la&s;ting fro&s;t, that the mercury, in <HI>de Li&s;ie's</HI> thermometer, &s;tood between 182 deg. to 196 deg. till the 3d of March. The &s;hocks &s;hook the works and workmen without doing any damage, and in the hou&s;es at the &s;ilver-manufac|tory, at Barnaul, at the di&s;tance of 170 miles, all the in&s;truments and furniture were waved &s;everal times backwards and forwards.</P>
<P>On the 17th of Augu&s;t, I left the &s;erpent-mountain, in my way to the &s;ilver-manufactory, at Barnaul, di&s;|tant
<PB N="223" REF="229">
170 miles, and thence to Tom&s;koi, 378 miles further.</P>
<P>Travelling on, I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome tumuli, on the 20th and 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of a heap of &s;tones co|vered with earth, in which were found &s;hin-bones and back-bones of men of a gigantic &s;ize. I cro&s;&s;ed the Alei, near the village Ka&s;china, about 70 miles from the &s;erpent-mountain, which has a fine, &s;tone-built church, a bailiff, and &s;everal villages dependent on it. I changed hor&s;es here and &s;ent my waggons on, the &s;traighte&s;t road, wandering my&s;elf through all the environs.</P>
<P>I reached Barnaul&s;koi on the 22d. one day after Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Falk,</HI> who arrived &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed as to take to his bed. Meaning to &s;top here but a few days, I was de&s;irous of &s;eeing the works as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and Major-General <HI>Yhrmann,</HI> commander-in-chief of the garri&s;ons, quartered on the mountains, gave me every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power; I therefore &s;at up the whole night, writing and drawing what I have here communicated.</P>
<P>Rich and important as the &s;erpent-mountain is in ores, is this place in it's works. Here the chief melting and refining of the gold and &s;ilver-ores, brought from that mountain, is performed. Here al&s;o are the head-quarters of the regiments and the chief mine-office
<PB N="224" REF="230">
of the whole di&s;trict. It's fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment was when <HI>Dimidof</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the mines of the Altai. The works were increa&s;ed in 1763, and the two manufac|tories of Nowo-pawlof&s;koi and Su&s;un&s;koi were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the &s;ame year. Barnaul, at fir&s;t, had only &s;ix bla&s;ts and three refining hearths. The ores are conveyed on the rivers Alei and T&s;chary&s;ch, to &s;ave the great expence of land-carriage.</P>
<P>The manufactory of Barnaul&s;koi, is built on a brook of the &s;ame name, near the mouth of the river Ob. The head of water, pent up for the mills, is 232 fathoms long and thirteen broad, and the re&s;ervoir has &s;o much water as to &s;upply the works throughout the year, with|out the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. All the huts or covered places for materials, are &s;ituated according to the be&s;t order and di&s;po&s;ition. They are built of wood, and encompa&s;&s;ed with a wall. The principal &s;treet con&s;i&s;ts of a beautiful town-hou&s;e, a mine-office, a &s;chool and the barracks. The places worked by water, are two &s;melting-hou&s;es, one with thirty bla&s;ts; a &s;tamping-mill, a forging and refining hearth, a &s;aw-mill, a corn-mill, a groat-mill, a poli&s;hing mill, and two other &s;tamping mills. The other offices are, an a&s;&s;ay-hou&s;e, with &s;ix bla&s;ts, a 'compting-hou&s;e, a &s;mall forge, a lock|&s;mith's work-&s;hop, and a bellows-factory. A trea&s;ury is going to be built, and a place to keep the archives of the manufactory. Near the dwelling-hou&s;es for the workmen, are magazines for provi&s;ions, corn, hay, &amp;c.
<PB N="225" REF="231">
On the other &s;ide of the dam head, is a fine new-built man&s;ion for the commander-in-chief; and clo&s;e by, &s;everal, fine hou&s;es, belonging to the military officers. Here is al&s;o a court of &s;worn citizens, a market, an ho&s;pital, a &s;tone-built, public apothecary's &s;hop, a bo|tanic garden, &s;tore-hou&s;es, powder and artillery ma|gazines, and the ca&s;erns of the garri&s;on. The num|ber of other dwelling-hou&s;es amounts to 1000. The place has al&s;o two wooden churches; but they have begun a fine, &s;tone-built church, on a magnificent plan, which will be one of the greate&s;t ornaments of the country.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme mine-office being here e&s;tabli&s;hed, there is a council, held by authority of the Empre&s;s, which not only commands all the mines of Altai, and the &s;ilver-manufactories on the Ob, but all the officers and workmen, and above 40,000 pea&s;ants, from the di&s;tricts of Tom&s;koi and Ku&s;nezkaja, who are obliged to work here for their poll-tax. The&s;e pea&s;ants are very li|berally paid; and as their homes are &s;ometimes at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, they receive a competent allowance for coming and returning, all regulated by the wi&s;e admini&s;tration of General <HI>Yhrmann.</HI> The ho&s;|pital is e&s;tabli&s;hed on very philanthropic principles; it has a chief &s;urgeon, and &s;ix under &s;urgeons: and, on account of the German works there carried on, they have a Prote&s;tant preacher. The garri&s;on here quartered, as a guard to the place, con&s;i&s;ts of a com|pany
<PB N="226" REF="232">
of dragoons, and three companies of foot-&s;oldiers, commanded by a major, who are paid, as if in camp. The number of ma&s;ters, and workmen, amounts to 400; and their children are not only in&s;tructed in reading and writing, but in merchants-accompts and geometry.</P>
<P>They u&s;e here annually from 28 to 30,000 ba&s;kets of charcoal; and to make 80 of &s;uch ba&s;kets, it takes 20 cubic fathoms of wood; but the price of &s;uch a ba&s;ket is not more than 25, or 26 copecs; about 13 pence Engli&s;h: and they &s;ell, annually, from 13 to 15,000 puds of lead. In the la&s;t eight months, they had already pa&s;t through 15 furnaces, for the melting of raw ores, 2,21,000 puds of ore.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e works in Barnaul, there are others in the neighbourhood, clo&s;e by; &s;uch as nine lime-kilns, a bell-foundery; a brick-kiln, 800 fathoms long; and al&s;o eight other kilns, joined together, in which they burn, with one fire, which does not la&s;t above three or four days, from 45 to 50,000 tiles; al&s;o, a gla&s;s-manufactory. At a little di&s;tance from Bernaul, is a country-hou&s;e, belonging to the general, called Charlotte-dale, &s;uperbly furni&s;hed, with a park, and exten&s;ive gardens, in which are many beautiful ca&s;|cades, fountains, and &s;tatues. Adjoining Bernaul, is a brew-hou&s;e, belonging to the crown. The &s;ale of &s;trong beer is prohibited here, but on certain days of fe&s;ti|vity;

or the workmen would drink too freely, and neglect their duty. Notwith&s;tanding the northern &s;itu|ation of this town, it enjoys a milder air, and warmer &s;ummers, than the more &s;outhern di&s;tricts. A proof of which is, that all garden-&s;tuff, except colliflowers, thrive here amazingly. The &s;andy and elevated di&s;trict, and the &s;helter of a dry fore&s;t, contributes much towards it. The only defect in the &s;ituation is, that the water every where has a bitteri&s;h ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I le&s;t Barnaul&s;koi on the 26th of Augu&s;t, and di|rected my road to the &s;ilver-manufactory at Nowo-Pawlof&s;ki, where I arrived the next day; &s;aw, as I pa&s;&s;ed, a lake, who&s;e appearance, at a di&s;tance, was blood red; and met with, in the fore&s;t, a peculiar &s;pecies of mice, <HI>(Mus Baraben&s;is),</HI> various remarkable agarics, among which there was <HI>Lycopendon &s;tellatum,</HI> and a particular &s;pecies of <HI>Hydnum.</HI></P>
<P>Nowo-Pawlof&s;ki is one of the manufactories lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, as an auxiliary to Barnaul, and promi&s;es to be a populous place. It has a conveniency of water, and every work and mill proper for the bu&s;ine&s;s; to enumerate them would be needle&s;s. Nothing is here performed, but &s;melting of raw ores. In the &s;tructure of their furnaces, they keep off the vapours of ar|&s;enic, which would be hurtful to the workmen; but, from the roa&s;ting of ores in the fields, the air is &s;o poi&s;oned by the &s;moke, that a great number of chicken,
<PB N="228" REF="234">
and other poultry, are killed by convul&s;ive di&s;|orders.</P>
<P>On the 28th I &s;et off for Tom&s;koi, and took Su|&s;un&s;koi in my way, which lies lower down the river Ob, at the di&s;tance of 54 miles, and where is a Si|berian mint. The Ob is larger than the Irti&s;ch, and equal to the Wolga, in its greate&s;t breadth. The villages, and mo&s;t of the towns, in the&s;e di&s;tricts, are happily &s;ituated along the river, and enriched by agri|culture, hunting and fi&s;hing; for they &s;ell their corn at a good price, to the &s;ilver-works, and the fortre&s;&s;es, along the Irti&s;ch. The &s;oil here is uncommonly fer|tile, though the black earth is not above &s;ix or &s;even inches deep, yet there is beneath it a marly loam, that makes the corn thrive exceedingly. The pea&s;ants along the Ob, were, till late, very rich in cattle, e&s;pecially in &s;tout, laborious hor&s;es; but, within a few years back, the plague has raged among the hor&s;es, and large cattle, and they have &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;&s;es. They have a cu&s;tom here, to turn great troops, or herds of hor&s;es, loo&s;e into the fore&s;t, without any one to look after them. In the Barabynian &s;tep, &s;ituate between the Ob and the Irti&s;ch, there are al&s;o wild hor&s;es, called <HI>Dit&s;chje,</HI> which run in herds; and the &s;tallions, that keep forward, looking out as &s;pies to ex|plore the enemy, are commonly &s;hot. They are mo&s;tly of a brown, fallow, and dun colour. The pea&s;ants get al&s;o a great deal of money by catching &s;quirrels, which
<PB N="229" REF="235">
are very abundant in the woods of this di&s;trict; they are large, hand&s;ome, and white, and their furs are purcha&s;ed by the Chine&s;e, at a price equal to ermine. The di&s;tance from the Ob to the Irti&s;ch, is between 4 and 500 miles.</P>
<P>I reached Su&s;un&s;koi on the 29th of Augu&s;t. This manufactory was e&s;tabli&s;hed in March 1764, for &s;melt|ing raw ores; but, in 1767, they added to it a mint. It lies on the river Su&s;un; but they have erected a mill-dam, which is 110 fathoms long, and 12 broad. Here, with the copper of gold and &s;ilver alloy received from the &s;ilver-manufactories, they coin a money, cur|rent in Siberia; for, as in the beginning of the &s;ilver-works here they had collected above 30,000 puds of copper, wherein were about three puds and an half of &s;ilver, and about three puds of gold, which to &s;eparate would have co&s;t more than it was worth; her Im|perial Maje&s;ty i&s;&s;ued an edict, in 1763, that, in future, all &s;uch &s;ilvery copper &s;hould be coined into a cur|rency, with the Siberian arms on it, according to its intrin&s;ic value, in the following pieces: <HI>viz.</HI> griws, or ten copec pieces; five ditto; two ditto, or gro&s;chewiki; copecs, half copecs or denu&s;chki; and quarter-copecs, or polu&s;chki: of which one part &s;hould &s;erve to pay the Siberian regiments; and the re&s;t the workmen, and other expences of the mines, and manufactories. The &s;um annually to be coined, was fixed at 250,000 rubles.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="236">The court of the mint is encompa&s;&s;ed with a high O&s;trog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O&s;trog, is a high wall, made with the bodies of trees, &s;et upright, &s;tanding clo&s;e together, u&s;ed here, formerly, to fortify &s;mall places, but, at pre&s;ent, only about &s;tore-hou&s;es and pri&s;ons.</NOTE>, and has but one entrance, which is guarded. Within it are, be&s;ides the pay-office, guard-room and coal-hou&s;e, a forge, with a large hammer and two fur|naces, where the great tools are forged; a &s;mith's work-&s;hop, where the &s;tamps and punches are made; a &s;melting-hou&s;e, with a lathe, worked by water, to turn cylinders, and the exten&s;ive building of the mint, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal divi&s;ions. In the mint, are four divi&s;ions, one has three flatting hammers, with two glow furnaces, two of which beat the copper into plates. In the &s;econd, are three flatting machines, to give the plates their proper thickne&s;s. The third divi&s;ion con|tains eight machines to cut the plates into round pieces, and the fourth, &s;ix &s;tamping machines: the whole worked by water.</P>
<P>The &s;tamp of the coin is uniform, having, on one &s;ide, the Empre&s;s's name (E.

<PB N="231" REF="237">
that country. In this mint was &s;truck, in the years 1760 and 1767, 278, 954 rubles; in 1768, 170, 070; and, in 1770, 250, 087 rubles, and &s;ome copecs: in all 899, 913 rubles, each ruble 4s. 6d. Engli&s;h. Here are a fine church, &s;everal, good, public offices, and about 200 hou&s;es; &s;ome beautiful meadows; and the place is truly delightful.</P>
<P>Among all the Imperial manufactories, &s;ituated on the Ob, this is the riche&s;t in wood, and will never want any. Though a &s;mall part of the fore&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of poplars and birches, e&s;pecially near the Ob, yet further on, are very fine timber-trees; and the fore&s;t extends to above 48 miles in length, and as many in breadth, without taking into the account other large fore&s;ts lower down the Ob, which are well adapted for new manufactories.</P>
<P>I left Su&s;un&s;koi on the 30th of Augu&s;t, for Tom|&s;koi. The country between the two places, is mo&s;tly covered with birch-wood, has a fine &s;oil, but not the hundredth part &s;o well inhabited as it de&s;erves. The field-mice had done a great deal of harm to the pre|&s;ent harve&s;t, and were every where in &s;cores to be &s;een. No &s;pecies of field-mice was more common than the yellow one, with a black &s;tripe down its back, and &s;ome &s;mall ones, quite yellow. Siberia produces two &s;pecies of field-mice of its own, &s;imilar to the com|mon, &s;hort-tailed ground-mou&s;e; the one much larger;
<PB N="232" REF="238">
with its ears quite concealed, and the other of a fox-colour.</P>
<P>Having got down from my waggon, on the 3d of September, to gather &s;ome &s;eeds, and endeavouring to get up again, I fell, and di&s;located my arm. It &s;welled &s;o much, and gave me &s;o much pain, that I could not rai&s;e it, and was obliged to wear it in a &s;ling till winter.</P>
<P>When I reached the river Tom, which was on the 6th of September, I found, among the pebbles, &s;ome beautiful, cornelian &s;tones; and, in Kaltai, a village 18 miles from Tom&s;koi, I was &s;hewn, many very valuable ores, found in the &s;ame river. In this place, its neighbourhood, and in and about Tom&s;koi, are &s;et|tled, from &s;ix to, 700 families of Mahomedan Tartars. They call them&s;elves <HI>T&s;chaty;</HI> and are, in their dre&s;s and manners, as al&s;o in their religion, little different from tho&s;e of Ca&s;an. Their women, contrary to the cu&s;tom of other Tartars, wear, over their veil, or ta&s;tar, a calotte, which has no opening in the top of the head, but covers it intirely. Their girls wear the &s;ame, braiding their hair into three, or more tre&s;&s;es, and into 30 tre&s;&s;es on the day of their marriage. They are fond of being buried on the borders of &s;ome fore&s;t, or wood, and erect, over their graves, &s;uch du|rable &s;heds of timber, that a burial-place, at a di&s;tance, has the appearance of a village. In their hou&s;es,
<PB N="233" REF="239">
e&s;pecially in their &s;ummer rooms, they have chimnies, like the Ba&s;kirs. They are good hu&s;bandmen, and pay their poll, or head-tax, with great chearfulne&s;s. In&s;tead of tea, they drink an infu&s;ion of the roots of the tormentil <HI>(Tormentilla erecta),</HI> which, when boiled, dyes the water reddi&s;h, gives it a very a&s;tringent ta&s;te, and is drank without milk. The chopped roots, or &s;talks of wild ro&s;es, u&s;ed, in&s;tead of tea, by the Tartars of Ca&s;an, have a far &s;weeter ta&s;te. I &s;aw, al&s;o, the following &s;pecies of cinque-foil, u&s;ed by the Si|berian Tartars in&s;tead of tea: <HI>Potentilla frutico&s;a,</HI> known, in the remote parts of Siberia, by the name of <HI>Kuril&s;koi T&s;chai,</HI> and <HI>Potentilla rupe&s;tris,</HI> which they call <HI>Polewoi,</HI> or <HI>meadow-tea,</HI> boiling the whole plant, with the flower, as &s;ome do the &s;age <HI>(Phlomis tubero&s;a).</HI></P>
<P>On the 8th we cro&s;&s;ed the river Tom, in a ferry; and the banks &s;triking my attention, I directed the watermen to row me to a particular &s;pot, which I exa|mined, and found the &s;oil to con&s;i&s;t of a blue, pirytuous, clay, uncommonly rich in vitriol. Some of the in|habitants of Tom&s;koi gather this vitriolic &s;ub&s;tance in dry weather, boil from it an impure, yellow vitriol, and &s;ell it from 60 to 80 copecs a pud, in&s;tead, of the genuine, Siberian &s;tone-butter. Even their yellow clay is of a vitriolic nature; and in it is found kidneys of a &s;lated &s;tone-ochre, which burns red, and is u&s;ed by cotton and callico-printers as a dye. In the &s;ame yel|low-clay, lay layers, or ne&s;ts of an impure, or blui&s;h,
<PB N="234" REF="240">
but &s;ome very fine, &s;now-white, porcelain earth, which the inhabitants fetch in quantities, to paint their ovens, rooms, &amp;c. with, and in the&s;e banks I found, in &s;ome vitriolic &s;late-layers, notwith&s;tanding their perpen|dicular folia and &s;trata, impre&s;&s;ions of little marine bodies.</P>
<P>Tom&s;koi lies on the right border of the river Tom, about 30 miles from its mouth, into the river Ob, on a very uneven &s;oil, and &s;preads it&s;elf in length of the river, from &s;outh to north. In the centre of the town is a high hill, on which is a fortre&s;s, erected 130 years &s;ince, with four towers, two gates, and a bell-&s;teeple. Within the&s;e is the wood-built cathedral, the town-hou&s;e, the hou&s;e of archives, and the trea&s;ury, built of &s;tone; a &s;tore-hou&s;e, where the furs, brought as tribute, are kept; a decayed guard-hou&s;e, and an ale-hou&s;e, where the Tartars, bringing their tribute, are regaled with beer. Here are al&s;o &s;everal private hou&s;es, the hou&s;e of the waywods, and a public pri&s;on. In the north-ea&s;t part of the town, is the church of the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t; and, without the town, &s;everal &s;alt-magazines. The mo&s;t important part of the town lay beyond the mountain, along the Tom; but the greate&s;t part thereof, with three churches, was unfortunately de&s;troyed, la&s;t year, by fire. The inha|bitants have been &s;ince compelled to erect their new buildings, agreeable to a certain plan, and uniformly corre&s;ponding with the whole; but, before the fire, the
<PB N="235" REF="241">
hou&s;es &s;tood &s;o irregular, that the windings of the &s;treets re&s;embled a labyrinth. The mud almo&s;t &s;wal|lowed up the wheels of our waggons, for the &s;treets will not be paved, till the new buildings are fini&s;hed. In the burnt part of the town was the mart, wherein the goods and property of many a citizen were devoured by the flames. In the &s;outhern part of the lower town is a friary, and a nunnery, with their churches; and the &s;ame part of the town has a church, called the Annunciation, and another, dedicated to the Virgin-Mary. Here is al&s;o another town-hou&s;e, a pri&s;on, a comptoir of the mine-office, and a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, for the &s;ale of brandies, brought here from the di&s;tilleries on the Tobol and I&s;et. The barges and ve&s;&s;els are moored below the town, on account of the &s;hallows near it; and, without the town, the Ko&s;kolnicks, or Old-Faithful, of which there is a great number among the inhabitants, have their burial-places; and &s;o have the Tartars.</P>
<P>Here re&s;ides the commander of the batallion in gar|ri&s;on; and to him the commanders of two other forts are &s;ubordinate. The court of waywodes is &s;ubordi|nate to that of Tobol&s;koi, and commands the mo&s;t populous di&s;trict of all Siberia, except that of To|bol&s;koi. The inhabitants of Tom&s;koi live mo&s;tly by trade. Here are no other manufactories, than &s;uch as dye Ru&s;&s;ian hides; and &s;ome few callico-printers. No where have I &s;een gluttony &s;o prevalent, as in this
<PB N="236" REF="242">
place; which, added to other reigning evils, forni|cation, and its attendant, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be a dreadful bar to population: e&s;pecially, as for want of regular &s;urgeons, the latter &s;preads it&s;elf exce&s;&s;ively. Was it not for this, the place is happily &s;ituated for commerce, which is carried on here with all parts of Siberia, by the communication of two navigable rivers. Bread is cheap, meat not wanting; and the Ob and Tom abound with fi&s;h, and &s;upply other towns with it. It is only to be wi&s;hed, that many &s;ober and indu&s;trious families might truly enjoy the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings!</P>
<P>Within the&s;e three years, the Chine&s;e trade has been &s;ettled on a proper footing; and the merchants have brought here, in the bales, a little, yellow hou&s;e-moth <HI>(Blatta A&s;iatica),</HI> which has increa&s;ed incredibly. In all the woods between the Ob and Tom, they have had an incredible number of &s;quirrels. It has already been &s;hewn, that they emigrate, in &s;ummer, from the &s;outh-ea&s;t mountains, into the di&s;trict of Tom&s;koi. Every ruined building of the town, and the towns of the fortre&s;s, were now infe&s;ted with them; and they were caught alive by boys, who &s;old them very cheap.</P>
<P>On the 11th of September, in the afternoon, I con|tinued my journey, and travelled 18 miles in the even|ing. This country is pretty well colonized with Tar|tars, and trouble&s;omely infe&s;ted with black crows,
<PB N="237" REF="243">
which are &s;o rapacious, that they will, in winter, attack a yard of poultry, in flocks of twenty at a time, and tear the fowls in pieces. I met here with a &s;pecies of hedge-&s;parrow, or little nightingale, with a fine yellow brea&s;t, and a green tail <HI>(Motacilla Cyanurus);</HI> al&s;o, a wonderfully &s;mall &s;pecies of &s;hrew-mou&s;e, that did not weigh, when full grown, more than half a dram. They are &s;omewhat browner than the common &s;hrew-mice, and have, in proportion to their body, a very thick, full, round tail. They are, therefore, quite different from the <HI>Sorex minutus</HI> of Linnaeus, which is al&s;o a Siberian animal, and are the &s;malle&s;t of all quadru|peds ever recorded, in human knowledge. This little animal &s;hall be fuller de&s;cribed hereafter. It is fond of the water, like the black water-&s;hrew, and the common &s;hrew-mou&s;e; both of which are very common here.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age over the river Ki is by a ferry. The river is &s;tony; and, among the pebbles, there are pieces of high-red, black, and al&s;o black and yellow &s;potted ja&s;per. Colonizing this di&s;trict, will make the farmers comfortable, and enable them to &s;ell their corn at a good price; which, at pre&s;ent, they are often compelled, by indigence, to part with, for little, or nothing. They have not, lately, been able to get more than three or four copecs, or one penny Engli&s;h, for 36lb. weight; and here are public granaries, where, when bought at this price, it is &s;tored up, near a navi|gable
<PB N="238" REF="244">
river, to be conveyed to places where no corn is grown. At the time when the poll-tax is to be paid, a good hor&s;e may be bought for two or three rubles; becau&s;e the indigent farmer can find no buyers. They have here a method of catching woodcocks, which fre|quent the birch-wood; &s;imple, yet effectual. Laying a large plank acro&s;s two branches of a birch-tree, they tie ears of corn at both ends, and at the di&s;tance of a few inches from each end, is fa&s;tened a circular &s;pringe, with a hor&s;e-hair &s;nare, tied on the plank. The wood-cocks &s;it on this plank, but cannot reach the ears of corn, unle&s;s they put their heads through the &s;pringe into the &s;nare, and, if they try to come back, they draw the &s;nare with them, and, attempting to fly, are entangled by the head. The pea&s;ants call this &s;nare, <HI>Nawori.</HI></P>
<P>I have already mentioned the Chine&s;e moth <HI>(Blatta A&s;iatica),</HI> which the Tartars call <HI>Tarakan.</HI> Here, in At&s;chinokoe (about 230 miles from Tom&s;koi), where I was on the 19th of September, a village &s;ituated on the navigable river T&s;chulym, the pea&s;ants hou&s;es are &s;o full of them, that, in the day-time, every dark corner, chink and clo&s;et, &s;warms; and, at night, they cover all the walls; nothing is free from the&s;e vermin, for they will enter the &s;malle&s;t clefts. No ve&s;&s;el, or box, be it ever &s;o clo&s;ely &s;hut, can remain in the&s;e rooms, without being filled, the next morning, with thou&s;ands of big and little Tarakans. They even
<PB N="239" REF="245">
thir&s;t after human blood; and, in one's &s;leep, all the uncovered parts of the body are bleeding with this in&s;ect: they will not touch any provi&s;ions, but bread, &s;ugar, and meat. There is no eating or drinking, in the&s;e rooms, without having one in&s;ect dropping, after another, from the cieling, into the di&s;hes, cups and plates. Various means have been tried to de&s;troy them, without effect. Shutting up a room, and &s;mok|ing it with brim&s;tone, and offen&s;ive herbs, have been tried, but to no purpo&s;e. The only way to get rid of them, is to let the rooms freeze, in the beginning of winter, without fire. This will apparently de&s;troy them; but, by con&s;tant warmth, they will &s;oon appear again; and, in &s;pring, everything crawls with them, as before.</P>
<P>About 112 miles further on, where I was on the 24th of September, I met with &s;ome Chri&s;tian Tartars, &s;et|tled on the brook Sulgun, who, in &s;ummer-time, live in wretched jurts, or huts, formed with high birch-poles, &s;et up in form of cones, flatted at top, and covered with &s;trongly boiled, birch-bark, &s;ewed together; and, in winter time, in hovels, made with birch-poles, laid acro&s;s each other, in form of a box. The fore-part of this box is left open, and repre&s;ents a hall, or anti|chamber; the other half is &s;hut up by a partition, in which is a &s;mall door, and on the out&s;ide covered thickly with turf, to keep it warm. In the middle of this inner room, they make a Ba&s;kirian chimney, of
<PB N="240" REF="246">
&s;prays and loam, with wooden air-pipes; and, on the roof, is left a little, &s;quare hole, to let in the light, which they &s;hut at night, and in very cold weather.</P>
<P>The&s;e Tartars have pre&s;erved mo&s;t of their ancient ways of living and thinking; for, independent of the crucifix, which they wear tied round their necks, and &s;u&s;pend al&s;o in their jurts, or tents; they know but little of the Chri&s;tian religion; and as little of the Ru&s;&s;ian manners, except an imitation of the female dre&s;s, and &s;ome few nece&s;&s;ary parts of agriculture. Their girls go about dre&s;&s;ed in the Tartarian fa&s;hion; and men wear furs and whi&s;kers. They are, in ge|neral, poor, and have but little cattle; owing, as is &s;aid, to the deep &s;nows, which fall in winter, and will not allow the cattle to look out for food; and to the great number of bea&s;ts of prey, in this di|&s;trict.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> gives us a further account of this people, whom he calls, the T&s;choulym Tartars. He &s;ays,
<Q>In &s;ummer-time, the men are dre&s;&s;ed like Ru&s;&s;ian pea|&s;ants; and, in winter, they wear long peli&s;es, made of deer-&s;kins. The women wear trow&s;ers, and boots, made of the large &s;kins of eel-powts. The other parts of their dre&s;s are like tho&s;e of the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants, except that they border their garments with
<PB N="241" REF="247">
fur. The girls plait their hair in tre&s;&s;es; and all the female &s;ex wear veils.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Their table is dirty, and badly accommodated. Fi&s;h is their common food; bread is &s;carce with them; as a &s;ub&s;titute for which, they eat dried fi&s;h, reduced to powder, which looks like a meal. Their greate&s;t delicacy, is parched grain, fre&s;h &s;talks of bear's foot, and the <HI>Acanthus,</HI> which they brui&s;e all together, and put under ground, till it is &s;our. In winter they &s;eldom eat any thing, but dried, or &s;moked fi&s;h. The poor, who have neither milk nor flour, live on various wild fruits and plants, which they &s;tore up again&s;t winter; indeed mo&s;t Tartars do the &s;ame; &s;uch as the roots of piony, pimpernel, <HI>(Sangui&s;orba),</HI> fumitory, <HI>(Fumaria bulbo&s;a),</HI> a &s;ort of thi&s;tle, <HI>(Carduus &s;erratuloides),</HI> and &s;erpentaria, <HI>(Polygon bi&s;torta),</HI> a root they call <HI>Mikir, (Polygon viviparum),</HI> the root of &s;agittary, <HI>(Sagittaria &s;agit|tifol.),</HI> and the root of <HI>Nymphea.</HI> The membrane under the bark of the pine-tree they give to children, as a &s;weetmeat; and they chew the root of <HI>Calamus acorus,</HI> as the Indians do the betel-root. All &s;moke tobacco, and drink, be&s;ides fi&s;h-broth, the liquors u&s;ed by the Ru&s;&s;ians, an infu&s;ion of rye-meal, &s;oured by fermentation, called <HI>Quas,</HI> which is a plea&s;ant liquor; <HI>Braga,</HI> a &s;mall beer; &s;trong beer, and Ru&s;s brandy.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="248">
<Q>The T&s;choulyms wore formerly Pagans, of the &s;ect of the Schamans. In the year 1720, a great number of them were converted to Chri&s;tianity, by the zeal of Archbi&s;hop Philotheus; but they are now merely nominal Chri&s;tians, and adhere chiefly to idolatry, in private. They place, however, an unlimited credulity in the efficacy of the crucifix, but retain the Pagan ceremonies of their ance&s;tors, as much as po&s;&s;ible. They abhor pork, and eat hor&s;e-fle&s;h, even that of di&s;ea&s;ed animals; and often &s;acrifice to their idols, in &s;ecret.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The bapti&s;ed Tartars of this tribe &s;olemnize their marriages in churches, but keep up to the old na|tional ceremonies. He who negotiates the mar|riage, takes a new Chine&s;e pipe and tobacco, goes to the young woman, and, having made his propo|&s;als, retires, for &s;ome minutes, leaving his pipe and tobacco on the table, which, if her friends take a whiff or two, denotes, that the propo&s;al is accepted, if not, the pipe is not touched. If he acquie&s;ces, he &s;ettles with her friends, concerning the quantity of cloaths, fur, or cattle, that is to be paid for the bride, which, in money, amounts generally from five to fifty rubles. After the marriage-ceremony, the young couple &s;leep in a new hut, built along-&s;ide of that belonging to the young woman's father; and, between the&s;e huts, a fire is kept up all night. The &s;ports on this fe&s;tival are, dancing, fea&s;ting, &amp;c. as

among other Tartars. The bridegroom is obliged to wre&s;tle, with the male relations of his wife, by the light of the before-mentioned fire. In the&s;e conte&s;ts, the hu&s;band mu&s;t conquer; and, if he throws his antagoni&s;t without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his &s;trength is very much commended. The nuptial bed is a piece of felt, &s;pread on the ground, on which the bride re|fu&s;es to lie down, imploring the interference of &s;ome female friend. This friend, a married woman, gets the better of her &s;cruples, gives her advice, and is rewarded with a hand&s;ome &s;uit of cloaths, for her kindne&s;s (See the Plate). If the young lady cannot produce, the next morning, Mo&s;aic proofs of her cha&s;tity, the hu&s;band &s;teals away, ties a parcel of herbs about his head, and, as a puni&s;hment to his perfidious wife, does not return, till he has ob|tained &s;atisfaction from him who has robbed him of his honour. This &s;ettled, all is forgotten.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When a woman is near her time of lying-in, &s;he calls in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her female neighbours; but they have &s;o little knowledge of midwifry, that numbers of infants are de&s;troyed in the birth, and many others have navel-ruptures.

<P><Q>Their regular manner of life, frugal, hard, and exempt from cares, keeps them in health; but, when they fall &s;ick, or wound them&s;elves, their &s;overeign remedy, both internally and externally, is the gall of a bear, and &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious appli|cations. The &s;mall-pox occa&s;ionally makes great ravage among them. They have an extreme dread of death; and, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that the &s;oul of a decea&s;ed per&s;on returns to &s;eek its &s;urviving rela|tions, and pur&s;ues them in union with the body, on coming from a funeral, they jump &s;everal times over a fire, conceiving, by this precaution, they can prevent the decea&s;ed per&s;on from following them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The language of the&s;e Tartars is a mixture of the Tartarian and Mongol; but has &s;o many words pe|culiar to it&s;elf, that it might be taken for a different language. They are neither cunning, nor &s;tupid; but tractable, attentive, eager for in&s;truction, and well-&s;killed in what they learn. When they have nothing to dread, they are frank, hone&s;t, and com|plai&s;ant; but when they have any thing to fear, or apprehend, they are &s;ullen, and deceit&s;ul. They are friendly, and attentive to one another; but lazy

in all kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;lovenly and filthy in their way of living.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They keep neither pigs nor poultry. Fi&s;hing and hunting is their chief employ; and the latter enables them to pay their tribute. Every man, capable of going a hunting, is obliged to pay the &s;tate three marten-&s;kins annually; or, in lieu of them, three elk-&s;kins, three fox-&s;kins, and 24 ermine-&s;kins; or any other furs, equal in value to three marten-&s;kins. The women are bu&s;ied in &s;pinning, weav|ing, and &s;ewing; and, as this takes up all their time, they &s;eldom &s;tir out of their huts, and look as if they were &s;moke-dried.</Q></P>
<P>In our way, we &s;aw &s;everal &s;cattered tumuli; which are &s;eldom, if ever, to be met with, but in the neigh|bourhood of &s;ome lake, or river; or on the fine&s;t, and mo&s;t elevated &s;pots of a field, the bottoms of mountains, and in flat vallies. Several I &s;aw, that reminded me of the old giant's graves, or beds of he|roes, found in the &s;ame form, in &s;ome parts of Ger|many; particularly in Mark-Brandenburg. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of little hills of earth, round which were &s;tuck, in the ground, &s;ome large, flat pieces of rock, and &s;ome had three little, &s;tone po&s;ts, &s;et near each other.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="253">The Tartars who now inhabit the&s;e di&s;tricts, acknowledge the nation from whom they derive their origin, as their ance&s;tors. It is an old &s;tory among them, that formerly there were two brothers (perhaps only nationally &s;o), one of whom, with his people, dug a great deal of gold and &s;ilver, out of the mountains; and the other was rich in cattle, and people: that the latter had often &s;o deprived the former of his trea|&s;ures, and mole&s;ted him, that he &s;ought refuge among the princes of China, who allotted him, and his peo|ple, a tract of country, towards the ea&s;t; and from the&s;e la&s;t they &s;prang. In the graves, which, differing in external appearance, are probably of one and the &s;ame nation, no other than copper tools and arms are found, and &s;ome few gold and &s;ilver ornaments; generally, no other gold than what is beaten out into thin leaves.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, among the old copper, dug out of &s;uch graves, and offered me by the pea&s;ants, I found copper points of lances, a kind of light battle-axe, daggers elegantly wrought, blades of knives, whet&s;tones, points of copper and bone-arrows, copper &s;cythes, &s;imilar to tho&s;e now u&s;ed in Siberia, &s;everal flat, ca&s;t figures of elks and rein-deer, &s;tags, chamois, and wild &s;heep. In the&s;e graves are &s;ometimes al&s;o found wooden frames, in which the dead bodies have been laid, with the figure of a chamois, fa&s;tened on the fore po&s;t of &s;uch a frame, and al&s;o &s;ome

little white &s;tones, in form of &s;nails, called, in Latin <HI>Cyprea nodo&s;a.</HI> I &s;hall, perhaps, give a further ac|count of the nature of the&s;e tumuli.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood, I pa&s;&s;ed a farm, belonging to a Tartar of Tom&s;koi; and al&s;o a country-re&s;idence belonging to the &s;ame per&s;on, elegantly built of larches, with a terrace on the top. Near this hou&s;e, are &s;everal hou&s;es, built in the Ru&s;&s;ian manner, be|longing to &s;ome of his relations. Here will al&s;o be built a church for the converted Tartars, hitherto be|longing to the di&s;trict of Schere&s;ch, which this patriotic Tartar is taking all imaginable pains to reduce from their wild, &s;avage &s;tate, to agriculture, and more &s;o|cial life.</P>
<P>In ferrying my waggons, in the morning early, over the river T&s;choulym, on the 27th of September, the boat which carried my baggage, was unfortunately over&s;et in the middle; but as the water was not more than &s;even feet deep, it was, with &s;ome difficulty, drawn out again; all its contents, however, were &s;o wet, that I was obliged to &s;top, till noon, to dry them. The next day I halted, among another tribe of Tartars, called <HI>Katchinzi,</HI> who&s;e jurts, or huts, were erected at the bottom of the high mountain Tarbig, where the white river Ujus &s;treams, and &s;preads it&s;elf along a fine, &s;andy vale, in which are &s;everal bitter lakes, and &s;alt-&s;pots, which Mr. <HI>Gmelin</HI> vi&s;ited, and from which
<PB N="248" REF="255">
the di&s;trict of Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja is &s;upplied with &s;alt. Having &s;pent the night here on the 28th, I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving and enquiring into the way of living of the&s;e wealthy Tartars; with whom mo&s;t others, living on the upper Jeni&s;ei, agree, in many points, and &s;eem to have a common origin.</P>
<P>The&s;e Tartars, who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the re&s;t, by the name of Katchinzi, do not con&s;i&s;t of more than one hundred men, who keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fine pa&s;ture-grounds between the Yjus and Abakan, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Jeni&s;ei. To judge of them by their language, they are true Tartars; but they are ba&s;tards in their features, dre&s;s and manners, of which they have adopted many of the Mongalian; becau&s;e, probably, they were under the yoke of the Kalmucks, and had thus a communication, as neigh|bours, with the Mongols: otherwi&s;e, they have many Mongalian words in their language, which a Tartar of Ca&s;an does not under&s;tand, and to whom their ex|pre&s;&s;ion and pronunciation appear &s;trange. The men &s;have their heads, like the Kalmucks; and leave only a half-circular whi&s;ker on the upper lip turned up, and a tu&s;t on the under lip, or chin. Mo&s;t of them, e&s;pecially the younger ones, make a tail of their black hair, on the hinder part of their heads; yet they do not &s;have, or cut off the re&s;t, but let it hang, about five or &s;ix inches long, about the head.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="256">In winter, they u&s;ually wear no &s;hirt; but a long &s;kin, furred within, on their bare bodies, with narrow &s;leeves. Mo&s;t of the&s;e furs are deer-&s;kins, which the women tan with the liver and brains of the &s;ame ani|mal, for 24 hours, then make them &s;oft over their knees, by rubbing them with a piece of wood, parti|cularly adapted for this purpo&s;e. The richer, and more noble among them, wear &s;heep or lambs furs; and, at fea&s;ts, and public &s;olemnities, upper garments of cloth, and &s;ilken under-ones. But the common people, be&s;ides their furs, and boots, wear nothing but a pair of white, coar&s;e, linen drawers, or trow&s;ers, which are made by their wives, from the hemp|nettle, growing in their vallies, and which they call <HI>Kender.</HI></P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the women differs little from the com|mon dre&s;s of the Kalmucks, and con&s;i&s;ts in two tre&s;&s;es of hair, hanging down their &s;houlders, and a round cap with a broad, fur border, a knot of fringes on the top, and two pieces of &s;ilk hanging down from be|hind. Girls, till the day of their nuptials, wear a little round cap, flatted behind, without any fur border, but with a red fringe, ta&s;&s;el, on the top. They braid their hair into nine tre&s;&s;es; three of which hang down the neck behind, and three on each &s;ide the head. The womens garments are elegantly cut out, e&s;pecially their furs. Some married women wear a brea&s;t-plate, or a collar, &s;et with beads. Children run mo&s;tly naked

about the jurts, or yourts. I call them &s;ometimes yourts, becau&s;e, as I have ob&s;erved before, the jod, <HI>J,</HI> in Tartary, is &s;ounded like our <HI>Y.</HI></P>
<P>The jurts, or tents, in which they live in win|ter, are &s;pacious, covered with felts, and &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Kalmucks, and Kirge&s;e. All live (the rich not excepted) in a manner uncommonly filthy and bruti&s;h, never wa&s;hing any ve&s;&s;els; but, as &s;oon as they are emptied, put them away, and, when they want them again, u&s;e them in the &s;ame &s;tate. Tho&s;e who call them&s;elves trouble&s;omely clean, will only rub them a little with their dirty hands. Their hou&s;hold-furniture con&s;i&s;ts of iron kettles, wooden cups, and birch-bark troughs. They make milk-brandy, as do the Kalmucks; and, during &s;ummer and autumn, whil&s;t their brandy la&s;ts, are &s;eldom &s;ober. They are all fond of &s;moking tobacco, women as well as men; and they will &s;moke 20 times out of the &s;ame Chine&s;e pipe. Their greate&s;t dainty, and mo&s;t common food, next to meat, is barley, or rye-groats, baked brown in a pan with flour, over which melted butter is poured. This di&s;h they call <HI>Ka&s;ch,</HI> and eat of it at any time of the day, when they are hungry. Be&s;ides this, they boil, and eat the &s;talks of cow-par&s;nep <HI>(Sphondylium),</HI> and all &s;orts of wild roots, as piony-roots, reed-mace, red lily roots <HI>(Lilium pomponium),</HI> and the dog's-tooth, <HI>(Erythronium),</HI> which they call <HI>Be&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="258">Of all the Tartarian tribes I have yet &s;een, this is the na&s;tie&s;t, the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable, and the mo&s;t treach|erous. They do not &s;pare even one another; are very ill-behaved when drunk, and often attack the Co&s;&s;acks, &s;ent, by order of the &s;tate, to re&s;tore peace and harmony. They are divided into ulu&s;&s;es, or which each has a head, whom they call <HI>Kna&s;zi,</HI> or little princes. They pay their tribute, or taxes, in furs or a competent &s;um of money; and, when they pay this tax, are u&s;ually heated with &s;trong liquor, and &s;eldom return without a quarrel and blood|&s;hed.</P>
<P>Their wealth con&s;i&s;ts in cattle, which feed, the whole winter, in the fine, mountainous &s;tep they inhabit, and retreat, in &s;ummer, to refre&s;hing and delightful vales; of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t thrive. The mountain-air, how|ever, prevents their growing large. Their hor&s;es are excellent hunters, light-coloured and &s;lender, and carry their &s;lit no&s;es in the wind; for they always &s;lit the no&s;trils of their hor&s;es. They water them without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, though in the mo&s;t violent heat, except in &s;pring-time, when they deem it hurtful; but no over-heated hor&s;e will they &s;uffer to eat, for the fir&s;t two hours. Their oxen and cows are &s;peckled, lively and &s;trong, but &s;mall in &s;ize. Their &s;heep are a me|dium between Kalmuck and Ru&s;&s;ian; their no&s;es are more bent, and their ears more hanging; have the &s;ame kind of wool, and a fat tail: &s;ome have horns,
<PB N="252" REF="259">
&s;ome not; and many rams have four and &s;ix horns each. Their general colour is white, with black or &s;peckled heads and brea&s;ts. Sheep, quite white or quite black, are rarely &s;een.</P>
<P>I could learn but little of the religious ceremonies of this people. They are true, and very rank hea|thens. They pray to their good god, turning their faces to the ea&s;t; dreading more a bad Being than a good one, and offer it &s;acrifices, that it may not hurt them. To this evil Being they offer a hor&s;e, at a &s;pring fe&s;tival; which mu&s;t be of a particular colour. It is led to the altar, and incen&s;ed with the &s;moke of the herb <HI>Irwen,</HI> which is a &s;pecies of fragrant worm-wood, wa&s;hed, and &s;prinkled with milk, which, during their prayers, they &s;catter in the air, and throw into the &s;acrificial fire; and, after having tied a red and white rag on the fore-part of the mane, and on the tail, they turn it loo&s;e among the herd. The&s;e &s;acred hor&s;es are called I&s;ik; and the ceremony above-men|tioned, is repeated annually; during which a &s;orcerer, or Kamno, acts the principal part. The &s;ame bad Being, as far as I could under&s;tand, is repre&s;ented by a hou&s;e-idol, which they call <HI>Tous,</HI> and which we find, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of every tent, &s;tuck on a &s;tick, &s;plit like a fork, or tied on, upon a band, acro&s;s two coar&s;ely carved figures, having the re&s;emblance of two birds, each bearing a woodcock's feather; &s;o that the whole has the appearance of a two-bodied bird, with
<PB N="253" REF="260">
extended wings. Between the&s;e two, little, carved figures, hangs a piece of fox or ermine-&s;kin, and a long tail of &s;plit &s;inews, interwoven with hor&s;e-hair.</P>
<P>In the yourts, or tents of the rich, I remarked, that there was, between the&s;e two pieces of wood, a wooden hoop or circle, with a carved beater tied on it; pro|bably a repre&s;entation of the magic drum of the Kam|no, who made and con&s;ecrated the idols. Be&s;ides the forked &s;tick, are two other &s;ticks, placed between the ropes that hold the tent together; one carrying a red, and the other a white rag, commonly accompanied by a blue one. The&s;e three colours &s;eem to be &s;acred among the Tartars; and the &s;ame are cho&s;en by their &s;orcerers, or Kamnos, for magic robes and ornaments The&s;e &s;ticks and rags are &s;ometimes on one &s;ide the idol, and &s;ometimes on the other. Many tents, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the poor, have only, in the forked &s;tick, the fur of a fox's tail, and, behind, the end of a &s;heep's tail, with its wool. On both &s;ides the&s;e orna|ments, hang little rags or blue cloth, and down the band, hangs a thick cord, made of brown and white &s;heep's wool, twi&s;ted. Be&s;ides this, there are &s;ticks, with white and red rags. Some hang up only an ermine &s;kin, in a &s;tick; the&s;e I found on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides of the tents; whereas the &s;ticks, with the rags, were only on the ea&s;tern &s;ide. They do not &s;uffer any one to touch the&s;e &s;acred things, and often pray
<PB N="254" REF="261">
about them, when they are in want of any thing. At the &s;pring-fea&s;t, this idol is al&s;o incen&s;ed, over the fire, with the herb Iwen; therefore, looks much &s;inged. In many tents, where I have &s;een the idol, I have &s;een al&s;o this herb, fixed up with it.</P>
<P><Q>Their &s;orcerers, or magic prie&s;ts and prie&s;te&s;&s;es, make u&s;e of &s;mall drums," &s;ays <HI>Gmelin,</HI> "in their incantations, as do the Laplanders; and are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, in dre&s;s, by a quantity of mi&s;hapen idols, rudely ca&s;t in iron, which are fa&s;tened on their garments, together with the claws of birds, and &s;trips of cloth and furs. Their caps are generally or|namented with a border of lynx-&s;kin, and a bunch of owls feathers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They have as many wives as they can maintain or purcha&s;e; but &s;eldom has one man more than four. The ceremony of a&s;king in marriage, is like that of the T&s;choulyms, excepting only that with the pipe of tobacco is left a cup of brandy. If the pipe is &s;moked, and the brandy drunk, the propo&s;al is accepted. Six months after this, the bridegroom comes, and courts the young woman in the &s;ame way; the price is then agreed for, which is from five to 100 head of cattle: but if the &s;uitor be poor, he will work for the father-in-law, for three, four, or five years, in order to obtain his daughter. Dur|ing this time, if any richer, or hand&s;omer gallant,
<PB N="255" REF="262">
applies for the girl, he carries her off, &s;eemingly again&s;t her inclination; and thus &s;hortens forma|lities. The injured lover, who perhaps has waited a year or two, accompanied by her friends, pur&s;ues the fugitive; but as the runaway-couple &s;eldom fails to improve that time, which the other lo&s;es in pre|paring for the pur&s;uit, and as the girl gives the preference to the pretended ravi&s;her, all the labour|ing lover can obtain, is a competent recompence for his pa&s;t &s;ervices. Should the betrothed dam&s;el die, before the performance of the marriage-contract, the price paid is withheld, for the purcha&s;e of her &s;i&s;ter; and if &s;he has no &s;i&s;ter, the &s;uiter lo&s;es his money, or his labour. If the young man dies before the wedding, the girl is the property of his father, who takes her home, and leads her to his ha|ram.</Q></P>
<P>When all preparations for the wedding are made, and the bridegroom arrives with his friends to fetch the bride, his parents and relations are introduced to the bride's father's tent, who &s;its at the upper end, with the mother; and all the re&s;t &s;it round in a circle, or &s;tand out before the tent. The bride then falls down before her parents, bidding them farewell, with tears; and takes her leave of her &s;i&s;ters and relations. The cries and lamentations of all the women pre&s;ent, now become general; and the bridegroom leads the bride away, by the hand, to another tent prepared for
<PB N="256" REF="263">
them. The whole day, then, and many following ones are &s;pent in fea&s;ting and diver&s;ions. Sometimes, a bride &s;hall be &s;ecretly carried off by a rival; in which ca&s;e the <HI>argumentum baculinum</HI> takes place, and the law of the fi&s;t decides between the parties. Should the bride be unfaithful to her lover, or commit adultery, there are various proceedings, which end in &s;atisfaction being made to the lover, or the hu&s;band.</P>
<P><Q>After the marriage, a father-in-law is not per|mitted to &s;ee a daughter-in-law; nor &s;he to look on him; and, if they meet by chance, &s;he falls flat on her face, that &s;he may conceal it. A hu&s;band di&s;|&s;atisfied with his wife, may return her to her friends, without any formal proce&s;s, though it be two or three years after marriage; but then he is obliged to maintain the children, and lo&s;es the money he paid for his wife.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is no di&s;ea&s;e peculiar to this people; ex|cept that a great number of the girls, in the time of their men&s;es, are in a &s;tate of furor, or phren&s;y, from which they do not return for many days. The &s;mall-pox, whenever it appears, makes great ra|vages among them. In ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, they have recour&s;e to the magic prie&s;t, who performs &s;acrifices for their cure, even in the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, which is no uncommon complaint.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264">They bury their dead without coffins, and in their u&s;ual dre&s;s; put &s;ome few nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils into the grave, and cover the corp&s;e with boards, before they &s;hovel in the earth, that the earth may not touch it. On the grave-hill, they place a drinking-cup, and leave it there. At the expiration of a year, from the day of interment, the relations of the decea&s;ed vi&s;it the grave, fir&s;t lament the lo&s;s of the decea&s;ed, and fini&s;h with drinking the &s;trong liquors they bring with them, out of that cup they left; and each drinks out of it &s;o often, that they generally return very merry from this mournful vi&s;it.</P>
<P>For all their diver&s;ions, they have but one mu&s;ical in&s;trument, called <HI>Jailtaga.</HI> It is a box of &s;ir, about four feet long, and three inches broad; the upper part open, over which &s;ix wire &s;trings are &s;tretched. It is played on with both hands, and produces treble and ba&s;e; it is u&s;ed with the left hand, and little with the right. To tune this in&s;trument, they place a bridge under each &s;tring, and &s;hi&s;t it, till it produces the tone they wi&s;h. Their maladies are like tho&s;e of the Kalmucks; and &s;o are their dances.</P>
<P>On the 29th of September I left the&s;e people, pa&s;&s;ed over a mountainous di&s;trict, and got before a great &s;alt-lake, <HI>Bylykul,</HI> 52 miles in circumference. There I met with a number of rare plants; and, among the&s;e, one that has not yet been de&s;cribed by botani&s;ts. It is
<PB N="258" REF="265">
a &s;pecies of madwort <HI>(Aly&s;&s;um),</HI> which I &s;hall give a de&s;cription of, when I meet with it more in perfection than at pre&s;ent. Not far from the Bylykul, we changed hor&s;es, and continued our road till we came to the mine Itkul&s;koi, where we &s;pent the night. The works here are &s;u&s;pended; but they have dug to the depth of 18 fathoms, and found a fine, lazuli ore, which contains, in 36 pounds of raw done, 15lb. of copper, nine drams of &s;ilver, and 13 drams and a half of gold. A new mine is opened clo&s;e by, and the pea&s;ants work here for their head-tax. The Jeni&s;ei here is 300 fathoms wide; we cro&s;&s;ed it, pa&s;&s;ing many i&s;lands in the middle, where grew a great quantity of wild hops, and, on the other &s;ide, found our&s;elves, on the 2d of October, in the fortre&s;s, Abakan&s;koi O&s;trog.</P>
<P>This is a wretched, decayed place, has a wooden church, and but few buildings; but a governor re&s;ides here, who has the command of all the di&s;trict round it. The climate is however mild; and an inhabitant of Little Ru&s;&s;ia, here &s;ettled, has begun to cultivate to|bacco, and intends to plant fruit-trees, and breed bees. About this place, there are abundance of rare, little birds; the &s;now-bird, the cro&s;s-bill, the water-wagtail, the titmou&s;e, and wood-pecker; which con|tinue here the whole winter. The inhabitants told me that, two years &s;ince, a number of white &s;potted bears had been &s;een here, who &s;eemed to have travelled from far, as they were quite lean and weak, and &s;o hungry, that they ran into &s;ome of the neighbouring villages, where many had been killed.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="266">During my &s;tay, here, I &s;aw two white &s;parrows, but none of my hunters could kill any. I would wil|lingly have &s;pent my winter here; but, there being no comfortable apartment to be had, was obliged to look out for proper accommodations in Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja. The winter was fa&s;t approaching, and being afraid of the river's freezing, I thought proper to &s;et out on the 4th of October, it being nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s the Jeni&s;ei, to go to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja.</P>
<P>On the 5th, being near the river, we &s;aw two floats coming down from the iron-manufactory e&s;tabli&s;hed a little higher up, and capable of receiving all our wag|gons. I had thus an opportunity of going to Kra&s;no|jar&s;kaja by water, which was at the di&s;tance of 75 miles. This manufactory was erected 16 years ago, by a merchant, who&s;e &s;on is now the proprietor. It be|longs to the di&s;trict of the &s;upreme mine-office at Catherineburg, though at the di&s;tance from it of 1875 miles. Its &s;ituation is delightful, and its mill-head 190 fathoms long. The works here con&s;i&s;t of five &s;melting furnaces, two bla&s;ts with double receiv|ers, and &s;everal forges and hammer-works.</P>
<P>All things being ready for our departure, we &s;et off on the floats, October the 8th, at noon; a third part of this pa&s;&s;age, at high-water, is often made in one day; but we were unfortunately delayed, by being &s;tranded on a &s;and-bank, by the imprudence of the wa|termen,
<PB N="260" REF="267">
and could not get off. With hard labour, however, we got clear in the &s;pace of three hours; and &s;oon after moored along &s;ide of the village Of|&s;char&s;kaja, where I took up my night's lodging. In the banks of the river, oppo&s;ite this place, they collect a great deal of that which is called &s;tone-butter. It is gathered here every year, from among the clefts of the black, allum &s;late, of which this bank con&s;i&s;ts; and is &s;old at Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, at 15 or 20 copecs per pud. The common people u&s;e it as a medicine in dy&s;en|teries; al&s;o again&s;t hemorrhages of lying-in women; and in venereal di&s;orders; and likewi&s;e, as an emetic, for children. In ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, they u&s;e al&s;o the &s;tone-vitriol, in&s;tead of vitriol, to dye leather; and black&s;miths u&s;e it, to make &s;teel.</P>
<P>Next morning, the 9th, we unmoored betimes, and continued our pa&s;&s;age down the Jeni&s;ei. Towards night, we reached the mouth of the river Mana, and the village O&s;jan&s;kaja, and &s;lept there. This village is a rare example of the propagation of mankind, in the wild de&s;arts of Siberia. The whole village, a few hou&s;es excepted, is inhabited by people originating from one &s;tock. Here are 25 wealthy families, and almo&s;t as many others, of the &s;ame origin, who are &s;ettled in the villages along the Jeni&s;ei. The father of this numerous po&s;terity, one Ju&s;chkof, came, two centuries ago, into this di&s;trict, from Ru&s;&s;ia; and it was, at that time, inhabited, and is mole&s;ted &s;till, by
<PB N="261" REF="268">
the Kirge&s;e. He had &s;even &s;ons, one of whom was killed by the Kirge&s;e; the re&s;t &s;ettled and increa&s;ed his progeny, and became fathers of 50 families.</P>
<P>Their indefatigable indu&s;try in hunting, &s;eems to be hereditary to the whole po&s;terity, for they are all peo|ple of property. With re&s;pect to hunting the wild uninhabited mountains upwards, the river Mana affords them an excellent opportunity; not to mention the &s;maller animals, as wea&s;els, &s;quirrels, &amp;c. they catch fables, lynxes, and bears, in abundance. The mu&s;k is al&s;o very abundant there. They catch it in autumn, and in the beginning of winter, with &s;nares and traps, in which the animal &s;hortly dies. The mu&s;k-bag, which is by far le&s;s fragrant than the Chine&s;e, is &s;old at from 20 to 30 copecs; and is u&s;ed, like their deer furs, as it &s;urpa&s;&s;es every fur, by its &s;oftne&s;s. The river Mana &s;upplies them, likewi&s;e, plentifully with fi&s;h; and, be&s;ides this, they apply them&s;elves to agriculture, and have &s;ome exten&s;ive farms upon the river. It is but 15 miles from the village we la&s;t &s;lept at to Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja; we reached that town on the 10th of October, 1771, in good time; and here I took up my winter-re&s;idence.</P>
<P>With this I &s;hall end the &s;econd part of my account; and &s;hall give the reader the ob&s;ervations I made, in the cour&s;e of this year, in the beginning of the third part.</P>

even in natural hi&s;tory, worth remarking, and what we could &s;uppo&s;e any cla&s;s of our readers might wi&s;h to be acquainted with. We have, however, pa&s;&s;ed over the nature of the roads, and the bad accommodations he met with. Suffice it to &s;ay, that being equipped, at government-expence, with &s;uch pa&s;sports and nece&s;&s;aries as a traveller, in &s;uch a wild and dreary country, might &s;tand in need of, &s;uch as credit, tents, provi&s;ions, forage, cloaths, me|dicines, mathematical in&s;truments, tools, men ver&s;ed in various &s;ciences, draft&s;men, hunt&s;men, interpre|ters, guides, e&s;corts, &s;ervants, waggons, &amp;c. he traced every navigable river, from its mouth to its &s;ource, travelled all the boundaries of the empire, from fort to fort; and at the&s;e places got a change of hor&s;es, occa&s;ional e&s;corts, and fre&s;h equipment. In &s;ome places, he traver&s;ed mountains; in others, forced through woods, almo&s;t impervious; in others, floundered over mar&s;hes; and, in others again, forded rivers, or cro&s;&s;ed them in ferries, or on rafts: &s;ometimes encamping in the de&s;arts, and often &s;leeping in the open air.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In &s;ome parts of Tartary, the roads are tolerably pa&s;&s;able; the cu&s;tomary highways are known from place to place, by the annual pa&s;&s;ing of caravans: there he found, occa&s;ionally, way-hou&s;es, with relays of hor&s;es, and &s;ome accommodations. Where there were no &s;uch hou&s;es, unle&s;s he was in the vicinage or
<PB N="264" REF="271">
&s;ome fortre&s;s, where the commanding-officer accom|modated him with regimental hor&s;es, and an e&s;|cort of the troops; he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of en|camping on the road, and refre&s;hing the &s;ame hor&s;es, by food and re&s;t. A number of difficulties he encountered, as we <HI>have</HI> &s;een, and <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;ee; but an inqui&s;itive mind, which is panting after know|ledge, fears no danger, &s;urmounts every ob&s;tacle in its way, and pur&s;ues its end with unremitting ardour.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, Oct.</HI> 1771. After my arrival here, the weather was uncommonly mild and delightful, as it u&s;ually happens in this &s;ea&s;on, throughout the &s;outh|ern di&s;trict of Siberia, and almo&s;t in all ea&s;tern, moun|tainous countries, At the latter end of the month, however, winter &s;et in; the whole di&s;trict was expo&s;ed to &s;torms, between N. W. and S. W. and the rivers drove a great deal of ice. It rained and &s;nowed till the 18th of November, when a fro&s;t &s;ucceeded, and &s;hut up the river Jeni&s;ei entirely. The rapidity of this river ge|nerally keeps it open till the middle of November, and the ice di&s;&s;olves again in April.</P>
<P>In the nights of the 7th and 8th of December, the cold was &s;everely felt; the thermometer mounted 190&deg; on the 9th in the morning, to 194&deg;; on the 10th, 203&deg;; on the 11th, 209&deg;; and on the twelfth, 202&deg;. It then &s;nowed; but, with the beginning of
<PB N="265" REF="272">
the year, the cold became &s;o inten&s;e, that, on the 5th of January, the thermometer pointed at 201&deg;, on the 6th, 206&deg;; the 8th, 212&deg;; and on the 9th, 196&deg;. A violent &s;torm, that blew from the north-we&s;t, con|cluded this &s;evere weather on the 13th, which brought on continual, we&s;tern &s;howers that augmented the &s;now, and the winter continued moderate. The &s;un began to &s;hine warm in the latter half of February, and the &s;now thawed away from mo&s;t &s;ummits of the neighbour|ing mountains.</P>
<P>The town, or city, has changed but little in the la&s;t thirty years. It is almo&s;t the &s;ame as it was when <HI>Gmelin</HI> was here. The &s;tone-cathedral is not yet fini&s;hed; the inhabitants are as few, and it has re|ceived no increa&s;e of buildings. Perhaps the indo|lence and debauchery of the common citizens, nur&s;ed by the low price of corn, and the great plenty of pro|vi&s;ions, may be the cau&s;e of the bad progre&s;s of this place. In every other re&s;pect, Kra&s;nojar&s;k is mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for commerce. It is, at pre|&s;ent, a place through which all Ru&s;&s;ian merchants pa&s;s to trade with the Chine&s;e; and it is here, and at Tom&s;koi, that pa&s;&s;engers eagerly buy up common &s;ables, and other furs, wanted by the Chine&s;e. From the months of November till February, we &s;ee many thou&s;and, hired &s;ledges pa&s;s, in caravans, through this town, which do not &s;top at all, becau&s;e the merchant to whom the caravan belongs, rides be|fore,
<PB N="266" REF="273">
and purcha&s;es the furs he wants, chiefly with ready money; of cour&s;e, Ru&s;&s;ia goods are much dearer here than in Irkuzkaja. Chine&s;e goods are al&s;o at a more than rea&s;onable price in the &s;hops here, be|cau&s;e the &s;ale of them is too incon&s;iderable, and there are but two or three merchants capable of dealing in &s;uch goods. They, therefore, put &s;uch a price on them, as they think proper, and certainly not to their di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>The productions of this di&s;trict are, in general, cheaper than the productions of any other part of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire; though no province complains of higher prices. I &s;hall &s;carcely be believed, when I de|clare that, on my arrival in Kra&s;nojar&s;k, a pud or 36lb. of rye-flour would &s;ell for no more than from 2&frac12; to 3 copecs, each copec a halfpenny Engli&s;h; wheat|flour, from 4&frac12; to 5 copecs per pud; beef, from 15 to 20 copecs; a cow, for one ruble (4s. 6d. Engli&s;h); good hor&s;es for three rubles, and &s;ometimes for two; a &s;heep, from 30 to 50 copecs; and hogs, at the &s;ame price. But the price of corn &s;eems to have ri&s;en a great deal, owing to the great quantities tran&s;ported on the rivers T&s;choulym and Ob, to the di&s;tant manu|factories, mines and fortre&s;&s;es; to a brandy-di&s;tillery, at no great di&s;tance; and to an Imperial magazine: and yet the price of rye has not ri&s;en more than five or &s;ix copecs per pud.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="274">Hence may be &s;een the great fertility and abund|ance of this di&s;trict; for though, within the town, there is great &s;carcity of buyers, as mo&s;t of the inha|bitants grow their own corn, and breed their own cat|tle, yet the great exportation of corn, in the barren di&s;tricts of the regency of Irkuzkaja, and more to the north about the Jeni&s;ei, one would imagine would be &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the prices higher, if the fertility of the country was not &s;o extraordinary. There has never been an in&s;tance of a failure in the crops; and it is reckoned but a moderate harve&s;t, when &s;ummer-rye produces ten-fold the &s;eed, the winter crops eight-fold, barley twelve-fold. In the wor&s;t years, wheat pro|duces &s;ix-fold; and oats, &s;eldom le&s;s than twenty-fold. Common buck-wheat is but little &s;own here; and, where it is &s;owed, it mu&s;t be done in &s;ome worn-out piece of ground, or the extraordinary richne&s;s of the &s;oil, would &s;poil the crop. In the wor&s;t ground, it will bear from twelve to fifteen-fold. This very rich &s;oil generally in the heights and vallies, is every where black and light, and forbids the u&s;e of all dre&s;&s;ing. A fallow of one year will improve the lands for ten or fifteen years, and &s;ometimes for a longer time; and &s;hould the fertility of this &s;oil decrea&s;e, the hu&s;band|man has &s;ufficient land in the &s;teps, that will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e. The new fields are commonly prepared after the &s;ummer-&s;eed is over. They burn it up fir&s;t in the beginning of June, plough it once more at the end
<PB N="268" REF="275">
of the month, and it is then fit to receive the &s;eed of the winter-crop in Augu&s;t: or they will &s;ow it with wheat, the en&s;uing &s;pring; in which ca&s;e, &s;uch new land is to be ploughed a third time; for there is no winter wheat throughout Siberia; though it is &s;o com|mon and u&s;eful in the di&s;tricts of Ca&s;an, and on the Kama. After the fir&s;t crop, &s;uch a field is left, during the next winter, unploughed. In the fourth &s;ummer, they lay it up, after ploughing it twice; and &s;uch lay|lands are &s;own in the autumn, or the following &s;pring; for mo&s;t grounds bear two years out of three, and high, dry, and &s;andy &s;pots, at lea&s;t every other year; and are fit for all &s;orts of corn, hemp, and pea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have been more circum&s;tantial here than I &s;hould have been, in order to give an account of the mode of agriculture in the ea&s;tern parts of Siberia; and to &s;hew how happy the countryman mu&s;t be in the&s;e foreign di&s;tricts, and how much they de&s;erve to be better peopled.</P>
<P>The juri&s;diction of the regency of this town &s;preads, in length and breadth, over 450 miles of ground; and yet is not inhabited by more than 15000 men; among whom are 3000 Tartars, who live merely by hunting, and breeding of cattle: yet this di&s;trict: &s;urpa&s;&s;es the more ea&s;tern countries of Siberia in population. But he who con&s;iders that Siberia has not, but within the&s;e
<PB N="269" REF="276">
two centuries, been much more peopled than North-America, and was then as unknown a wilderne&s;s as that, mu&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed at the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the country, and the great number of Ru&s;&s;ian inhabitants, who far &s;urpa&s;s the natives, in &s;kill and indu&s;try. The di&s;covery, and rapid conque&s;t of &s;o va&s;t a territory, unknown before, extending to the ea&s;tern ocean, mu&s;t be an everla&s;ting monument of celebrity to the genius, intrepidity and per&s;everance of the Ru&s;&s;ian nation; and its population, now carrying on to the utmo&s;t, may be looked upon as a ma&s;ter-piece in policy.</P>
<P>The Siberians pay but little attention to culinary herbs, though they thrive well in Kra&s;nojar&s;k, and all the &s;outhern di&s;tricts of Siberia. The early, white fro&s;ts in autumn, do le&s;s damage even to the mo&s;t ten|der plants, than the later fro&s;ts in May; of cour&s;e, gourds and girkins come to perfection in the open fields, when melons and water-melons will &s;carce thrive in gardens. They have begun to cultivate tobacco, and with great &s;ucce&s;s. This plant finds many pur|cha&s;ers among the Pagan nations; but they do not know the proper time when the leaves are to be taken off, or how to prepare them. The tobacco, therefore, of Kra&s;nojar&s;k, on account of its greenne&s;s, goes by a different name from other tobacco; and the be&s;t price it will fetch, is about 25 copecs per pud, whil&s;t the common leaves, grown in and about Udin&s;kaja,
<PB N="270" REF="277">
will fetch 60 copecs. The inhabitants of this place carry on a good trade in wild hops, which grow plen|tifully in the i&s;lands of the Jeni&s;ei, and bring here a number of buyers in autumn. They &s;ell at the rate of from 50 copecs to one ruble per pud. They are chiefly carried to Jeni&s;eikaja, Irkuzkaja, and tho&s;e di&s;tricts upon the Tungu&s;ka where there are no hops. What they do not &s;ell, they keep for their own brewing; and hereby indulge their debauchery.</P>
<P>Among the u&s;ual, wild growths of the mountains of Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, the rhapontic, or rhubarb, de&s;erves our notice. When the medical college, at Peter&s;burgh, is in want of any, the people here engage to procure a certain quantity, and carry it to the town-hou&s;e, at a certain price. To do this, they employ a number of mountaineers to dig the root in autumn, in places be|yond the Abakan. The be&s;t is brought from Udin&s;|kaja, and is dug in the mountains, about the rivers Uda and Birju&s;&s;a. Commonly they are roots of the rhubarb <HI>(Rheum undulatum),</HI> and &s;ome other &s;uch like &s;pecies, which &s;eems to be different from what bota|ni&s;ts call <HI>Rhaponticum.</HI> I am at a lo&s;s to know whe|ther the moi&s;tne&s;s of the &s;oil in which the Siberian rhapontic grows, about the mountain-brooks, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the climate, e&s;pecially the wetne&s;s of the la&s;t &s;ummer, when all the old rhapontic-plants were rotten in the principal knots of their roots, which are often very large. The innermo&s;t parts of the thick
<PB N="271" REF="278">
root is always found, there, changed, quite to the peel, into a yellow-brown, marrow-like matter, bitter, and a&s;tringent to the ta&s;te: it is only in the cylindrical con|tinuations of the roots, that there is any good medicinal virtue; and, therefore, the Siberian rhapontic is vul|garly called, on account of its form, <HI>T&s;cherenkowoi Re|wenn.</HI> During the winter, 1771, they &s;ent, from Kra&s;|nojar&s;k to Tobol&s;koi, 511 puds; from whence it was conveyed to Peter&s;burgh, for the u&s;e of the college. But the&s;e roots might have been gotten better and &s;tronger, if the rhapontic diggers had more particular directions how to prepare it: for, as &s;oon as the&s;e people have brought the roots home, they peel, cut them in pieces, and dry them in a gentle warmth; and hereby the root lo&s;es its mo&s;t efficacious moi&s;tne&s;s, dries up, and becomes quite &s;pongy, &s;o as to be very unlike the genuine rhubarb, either in appearance, or &s;trength. On the contrary, I took &s;everal rhapontic roots, which I received quite untouched, &s;ome from Udin&s;kaja, and &s;ome from the Sajanian mountains, which I hung up in the cieling of a warm room, and, when &s;ufficiently dried, I &s;haved off the medicinal parts of the root quite clean, and found them compact, and high-coloured, like the be&s;t Chine&s;e rhubarb; and it was very little inferior to that in &s;trength, and far &s;u|perior, in ta&s;te and efficacy, to the rhapontic, pre|pared in the common way. Were it po&s;&s;ible to find di&s;tricts in the Siberian mountains, where the prin|cipal
<PB N="272" REF="279">
&s;tem of the rhapontic is not rotten, I doubt not but all its roots, if prepared in my way, would be equal, at lea&s;t very little inferior, in &s;ize, beau|ty, &s;olidity, and &s;trength, to the Chine&s;e rhu|barb.</P>
<P>Kra&s;nojar&s;kaja, like mo&s;t parts of Siberia, abounds in all &s;orts of wood; and the fine&s;t timber may be felled, with very little trouble, from the deep moun|tains about the Jeni&s;ei, and floated down to this town. Except the plane, the elm, and the linden-tree, which are not to be found in the ea&s;tern part of Siberia, all common &s;pecies of trees are to be met with in great abundance. There is al&s;o great quantities of cedars in the neighbourhood of the river Mana. About Abakan|&s;kaja grows, on the Jeni&s;ei, abundance of fragrant poplars, who&s;e re&s;inous buds afford a delicious winter-repa&s;t to woodcocks, and gives their entrails a fine bal&s;amic perfume. There is al&s;o a great deal of under|wood, of various denominations; particularly the haw|thorn, and cotona&s;ter.</P>
<P>Kra&s;nojar&s;k is plentifully &s;upplied, in winter, with game, and all &s;orts of furs. A liberty of hunting &s;uch animals, properly &s;peaking, is only granted to the Siberians; who pay a tax for &s;uch leave, and who make hunting their principal occupation: yet the Ru&s;|&s;ian pea&s;ant commonly devotes his indolent winter to the chace. They &s;et traps and &s;nares for all &s;pecies of
<PB N="273" REF="280">
game, and catch a great number of ermines, and other animals. The&s;e people will purcha&s;e, from the ma|gi&s;trates, a permi&s;&s;ion to hunt; and are at liberty to hunt with &s;uch a licence; but if they hunt, without obtaining this, run the ri&s;k of being caught by the Tartars, and cha&s;ti&s;ed upon the &s;pot, or put into the hands of ju&s;tice, which always rewards the appre|hender.</P>
<P>Sables are a common animal in the di&s;trict of Kra&s;|nojar&s;kai; and there are two &s;pecies, &s;ome long-haired and greyi&s;h, and &s;ome &s;hort-haired and black. Tho&s;e caught about this place are of inferior value. Wolves are much extirpated here, as they are in mo&s;t parts of Siberia. Foxes, however, are very abundant in the open di&s;tricts; and they bring, from the northern parts, black, and black-grey ones, of great value. Beavers and otters are al&s;o abundantly met with; and the latter are often &s;old at &s;even rubles each, and ex|ported to the frontiers of China. Lynxes are not ge|neral, and reach to the &s;ame price; their parti-coloured fore-paws are &s;old &s;eparately. Hyenas are more abundant; and a black one will &s;ell for four rubles. There are &s;till a greater number of badgers; but as their &s;kins are of little value, they are &s;eldom killed, but when they are bad neighbours, or when their fat is wanted. Ermines are caught in large quantities. Whil&s;t they were &s;aleable, in the Chine&s;e trade, a &s;kin would &s;ell for 25 copecs; but there is no buyer now
<PB N="274" REF="281">
that will give a fifth of that price. The yellow wea&s;els may be plentifully caught in the woody di&s;tricts, and with little trouble. Tho&s;e which by accident fall into the traps, or &s;nares, are purcha&s;ed by merchant-pa&s;|&s;engers, at five or &s;ix copecs each; and are a favourite object of &s;ale to the Chine&s;e, who pay a very good price for them: of cour&s;e, they are &s;old much dearer at Irkuzkaja, and are not carried into Ru&s;&s;ia at all. The pole-cat is not bought here, at any price; though its &s;kin is much finer in Siberia, and of a much whiter and more elegant colour, than in Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Larger game, as elks, &s;tags, deer, and mu&s;ks, are in great abundance; e&s;pecially on the other &s;ide of the Jeni&s;ei. The Tartars pay a good part of their taxes in elk, and large &s;tag-&s;kins; which the trea&s;ury takes for the u&s;e of the cavalry, at 60 and 120 copecs each. According, however, to a new regulation, the head-tax is no longer paid per head, but by whole tribes; &s;o that all the Pagan families in the di&s;trict of Kra&s;nojar&s;k, pay together 5262 &s;ables; yet the tax goes by the denomination of that &s;pecies of fur not|with&s;tanding, though the tribute is paid in other furs, or in money, rating a &s;able at one ruble.</P>
<P>Deers are &s;o common here, that the whole animal, &s;le&s;h and fur, will &s;carce &s;ell for 15 copecs: hence their &s;kins are mo&s;tly u&s;ed, and &s;old for furs to travel in; and the price for one, is in copecs. Mu&s;ks, I
<PB N="275" REF="282">
ob&s;erved, were here caught in great numbers. The males are &s;old, on account of their bags <HI>(Struika),</HI> from 30 to 50 copecs each; whereas the female, fur and &s;le&s;h, will &s;carce fetch 10 copecs. They brought me, as a great curio&s;ity, a female mu&s;k, quite white; and, afterwards, they &s;ent me the white fur of a male.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h is not &s;o abundant in this province, as in &s;ome other parts. The Kat&s;cha being &s;hallow, like many other Siberian rivers, becomes &s;tinking in win|ter-time, under the ice, and has therefore no fi&s;h. The Jeni&s;ei has but few branches; and, on account of its rocky bottom, and the rapidity of its &s;tream, is very little fit for fi&s;hing. Fi&s;hes of pa&s;&s;age very &s;eldom come into it, from the north, or glacial &s;ea. It has but one or two &s;pecies of Ru&s;&s;ian &s;almon, and very few &s;turgeons; and hu&s;os are found in it, which are very delicious. They are, however, not ea&s;ily taken; as they &s;elect &s;uch deep &s;pots, in winter, as cannot be got at.</P>

<P>In January, Mr. Surjef arrived at my lodgings in Kra&s;nojar&s;k, from a tour he had made, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ummer, along the river Ob, to the frozen ocean. I will give my readers an extract of his ob&s;ervations and papers, from the time of his de|parture.</P>
<P>He left T&s;cheljabyn&s;kaja on the 26th of February, 1771: his road, as far as Tobol&s;koi, produced no|thing remarkable. In the latter place, he was mo&s;t kindly received by his excellency Governor T&s;chit|&s;cherin, who gave him every nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;sport for the di&s;trict of Bere&s;owa; to which place he &s;et forward, on a &s;ledge, on the 8th of March. His road thither was principally all along the banks of the Irti&s;ch, which are &s;cattered with Tartarian, Ru&s;&s;ian, and, far|ther north, with Ea&s;tjaikian villages, through which he pa&s;&s;ed. The Tartarian towns reach only as far as Demjan&s;koi jam, at the di&s;tance of about 195 miles from Tobol&s;koi; but the Ea&s;tjaikian villages extend beyond Demjan&s;koi, and occur frequently. In &s;ome villages, the Ea&s;tjaiks live with the Ru&s;&s;ians; and, in general, as far as Bere&s;owa, are apparently chri&s;tians, having been bapti&s;ed. All the way, as far as Demjan|&s;koi
<PB N="277" REF="284">
jam, the country is, in a great mea&s;ure, under cultivation by the Ru&s;&s;ians and Tartars. From this place, northwards, they &s;aw nothing but barley and oats, and very little &s;ummer corn, as it does not thrive, owing to the cold and moi&s;tne&s;s of the &s;oil: they &s;ow hemp and flax among it. The colewort gets no heads here, and grows loo&s;e in leaves. Leeks, radi&s;hes, tur|neps, and hor&s;e-radi&s;h, if the weather is tolerable, thrive pretty well.</P>
<P>Further down the river, into the &s;teps, the country is not habitable at all, being wholly wood and deep mires, impervious at all &s;ea&s;ons. The wood chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of underwood, and badly grown trees. The mo&s;t common trees are, willows, dwarf-cherries, alders, white cornels, a&s;ps, poplars, birches, pines and firs, which are &s;eldom of a fine growth. The linden is not &s;een further north than 27 miles from Tobol&s;koi. Of &s;mall bu&s;hes and &s;hrubs, the country produces red and black currants, the <HI>uva ur&s;i,</HI> and &s;everal others. On both &s;ides the river are lakes, which have a communication with the river, where the water is high.</P>
<P>Samarof&s;koi jam is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable place be|tween Tobol&s;koi and Bere&s;owa, and is di&s;tant from the former town 412 miles, by water, and &s;ituated on the right of the Irti&s;ch, in a low border, ju&s;t underneath a higher and more mountainous country, only 20 miles beyond the communication of the Irti&s;ch with the Ob.
<PB N="278" REF="285">
The place was colonized in 1637, with &s;everal families from Demjan&s;koi, and the northern di&s;tricts of the regency of Ca&s;an; and con&s;i&s;ts of 100 dwellings, and a church. The inhabitants have no agriculture; and, further north, up the Ob to the Surgut and Narym, no corn is &s;own at all, but is brought, by the Irti&s;ch, from Tobol&s;koi.</P>
<P>In Samarof&s;koi, hor&s;es do not thrive well; they die, in great numbers, for want of provi&s;ion. La&s;t year, the water was &s;o high, that it covered all the meadows with &s;lime, ju&s;t before they were to be cut, and &s;poiled them. This di&s;trict, however, is ble&s;&s;ed with an abundance of fi&s;h and water-fowl, on which the Ru&s;&s;ian inhabitants, and Ea&s;tjaiks, have their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. The Chine&s;e moths are found, in this place, but no farther north.</P>
<P>Bere&s;owa, called, by the Ea&s;tjaiks, Sumytwa&s;ch, by the Samojedes, Chucharn, lies on the river Jo&s;wa, at 20 miles from its mouth into the next branch of the Ob. It is irregularly built, and has not above 150 hou&s;es, mo&s;tly inhabited by Co&s;&s;acks; but there are al&s;o two churches, and a cathedral, or mother-church, all built of &s;tone. Without the town is a chapel, dedicated to St. Alexander New&s;koi, of whom they tell a number of miraculous &s;tories; particularly one of a cedar-tree's growing in the centre of the chapel, whil&s;t they were building it. The inhabitants
<PB N="279" REF="286">
are &s;ub&s;tantial, peaceable, and ho&s;pitable people, who have enriched them&s;elves by fi&s;hing, hunting, breeding of rein-deer, and trading with the pagan and Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, who vi&s;it them. They pay little attention to the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of their &s;ituation; and, by in|temperate drinking, bring on a great many di&s;ea&s;es, and often &s;udden death.</P>
<P>Bere&s;owa &s;upplies Tobol&s;koi, and other towns &s;itu|ated on the river Ob, with frozen fi&s;h in winter, and dried fi&s;h in &s;ummer. From this place are brought half the blue and white ice-foxes, dre&s;&s;ed and undre&s;&s;ed elk and rein-deer &s;kins, black and white bear-&s;kins, red foxes, wolves, bad &s;ables, a great number of bea|vers and otters, and abundance of other furs. For agriculture the country is unfit, like all others north of this. The environs of the town are low and mar&s;hy woods, of birch, fir, and cedar; the trees of which are not very tall. Of garden-&s;tuff, &s;ome thrives very well. The fi&s;hery is a&s;toni&s;hingly rich; and, from &s;pring to autumn, they have an inexpre&s;&s;ible quantity of large water-fowls, as &s;wans, gee&s;e, ducks, &amp;c. The mo&s;t wealthy of the inhabitants keep, in the northern di&s;tricts, large herds of rein-deer, under the care of &s;hepherds; for this is the only dome&s;tic animal that will thrive well in the north. Oxen and hor&s;es cannot live there. Few of the inhabitants keep either &s;heep, &s;wine, or chickens. Tho&s;e who keep the latter, are obliged to &s;hut them up, le&s;t they &s;hould be torn by
<PB N="280" REF="287">
the dogs; for as dogs are employed, in winter-time, to draw little, travelling &s;ledges, to carry wood, and other &s;ervices, a great number of them are kept; and they are the more u&s;eful, as they require little attend|ance, and will pick up their living on the remains of fi&s;h and fowl that is every where &s;cattered, and par|ticularly as they will feed on the water-rat, of which there are many in the Ob. But, in another re&s;pect, the&s;e animals are a nui&s;ance, as they make an intole|rable howling every morning, throughout the whole town; like the crowing of cocks, as &s;oon as one begins, all the dogs of the town are &s;ure to follow.</P>
<P>Bere&s;owa lies about five degrees more to the north than Tobol&s;koi; according to the oblique direction of the rivers, the di&s;tance from it, by water, is 757 miles; by land, in the winter-road, only 675 miles. Not|with&s;tanding the &s;ummer is &s;hort, it is &s;ometimes very hot; and the weather, in winter, often &s;o &s;oft and mild, that the &s;now melts upon the roads. In 1771, the warm weather continued all Augu&s;t and September; but the fro&s;t followed &s;o &s;uddenly, that the rivers were frozen in the middle of October. The Ob u&s;ually freezes about that time, and is not open before the end of May.</P>
<P>Birds of pa&s;&s;age arrive much &s;ooner than the end of May, and continue in the lakes till they find, in the
<PB N="281" REF="288">
rivers, and in the northermo&s;t wilds, proper places to make their ne&s;ts. Should there be &s;till, on their ar|rival, any winter weather in the di&s;trict of Bere&s;owa, they make up the river into the more &s;outhern and watry di&s;tricts upon the Irti&s;ch; and, as &s;oon as the weather becomes milder, draw down in crowds north|wards, to people their cold and native home. Mr. Surjef &s;pent the &s;pring at Bere&s;owa, collecting the rare&s;t &s;pecies of water-fowl, and their number is a&s;toni&s;hing. The mo&s;t curious birds he brought me were as follow: Of the goo&s;e kind, <HI>An&s;er pul|chri collis;</HI> of ducks, <HI>Anas fu&s;ca, nigra, marila, hy|emalis,</HI> and <HI>acuta,</HI> which were caught in great num|bers; the diver, <HI>Colymbus arcticus et immer.</HI> Of gulls, <HI>Larus minutus;</HI> of land-birds, the falcon, <HI>Falco bar|barus,</HI> which builds its ne&s;t in the northermo&s;t moun|tains in &s;ummer; and the wood-pecker, <HI>Picus tridactylus.</HI> Every &s;pecies of wild duck, &s;mall and large gee&s;e, common plovers and gulls, &s;nipes, and other &s;uch birds, increa&s;e the crowd; and their number is above expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When Mr. Surjef had completed his collection of water-fowls, he proceeded on his journey to the &s;ea-coa&s;t. In &s;ummer, there is no way to Obdor&s;koi-Gorodok, the mo&s;t northern place of note, but by water; he therefore &s;et out the 11th of June, with a hunt&s;man, an interpreter, and &s;ix co&s;&s;acks, in a large barge. The river had now &s;o much overflown all the
<PB N="282" REF="289">
low lands and i&s;lands, that it looked like a va&s;t &s;ea; here and there a willow-tree, &s;hewing its top above water. He arrived at Obdor&s;koi-Gorodok on the 14th, a di&s;tance, by water, of 225 miles. This place is called, by the Ea&s;tjaicks, <HI>Pulnowat-wa&s;ch;</HI> and, by the Samojedes, <HI>Sola Chern.</HI> It is &s;ituated near the 67th degree of north-latitude, and is erected on a moun|tain, on the border of the little river Polni, which, at four miles from thence, empties it&s;elf, on the right, into the Ob. Obdor&s;koi-Gorodok con&s;i&s;ts only of five hou&s;es, but a number of magazines and &s;tore-hou&s;es; and has, at a di&s;tance, the appearance of a very exten&s;ive village. It has a church, dedicated to St. Ba&s;il. The Ru&s;&s;ian inhabitants remain there during the winter, and leave it in &s;ummer; but many Ea&s;t|jaiks repair there in winter, and live in demi-&s;ubter|ranean dwellings. Here re&s;ides an in&s;pector, or Ope|kun, placed over the neighbouring Ea&s;tjaiks and Sa|mojedes: he is a Co&s;&s;ack born, and commands an Ataman, and 25 Co&s;&s;acks.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict on both &s;ides the Ob, is mountainous; and the mountains, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of a chertz|like &s;late, are very bare. Near Obdor&s;kaja there are no other trees than &s;ome few willow-bu&s;hes on the bor|der of the Polni; higher up that river are larches, pines, birches, and alders, and &s;ome few pine-trees. Near the icy &s;ea grow &s;ome little larches and alders; but they creep upon the ground, like e&s;paliers, or like
<PB N="283" REF="290">
the &s;hrubs in high mountains. In Obdor&s;kaja the &s;um|mer is very delightful, by the continual pre&s;ence of the &s;un, though it be but &s;hort. During the long days, the &s;un, at night, is but one hour invi&s;ible; hiding it|&s;elf behind an adjacent mountain, but does not &s;ink below the horizon. At this time, at night, when near the horizon, it is very large, and its light &s;o weak, that it may be looked at &s;tedfa&s;tly with the naked eye. On the 30th of July, the &s;un &s;et, &s;o that the &s;tars be|came vi&s;ible. In winter-time, the long light does not la&s;t more than two or three hours, except when the brilliant, northern lights illumine the nocturnal hemi&s;|phere. About Obdor&s;kaja one never hears the bu&s;tling noi&s;e which many of the&s;e phenomena make in the air. They commonly appear like bright bows about the ho|rizon, from which i&s;&s;ue &s;ome very agile, light columns. Seldom is a tempe&s;t heard here in &s;ummer; never above once or twice in the whole di&s;trict: but thunder is commonly heard, as at a di&s;tance, rolling from north to &s;outh. The weather is &s;carce ever &s;o warm, as to render a light fur-dre&s;s in&s;upportable. On his journey to the glacial &s;ea, Mr. Surjef felt but five days &s;o warm, that he could &s;ay he &s;weated, or could go with|out a fur. In July, the northern winds begin; white fro&s;ts, and ice, is not uncommon, and the plants turn yellow. The large&s;t radi&s;hes, and turneps, they can rai&s;e at Obdor&s;kaja, weigh &s;omewhat more than five ounces, but the leaves grow a foot long. No other garden-&s;tuff thrives at all. The ground thaws only on
<PB N="284" REF="291">
the &s;urface; and, near Obdor&s;kaja, the elevated flat &s;oil becomes wet, nine, twelve, or fifteen inches deep; lower on, it is &s;carce &s;ix inches deep. Further north|ward, the ground is higher and &s;andy, to the depth of &s;ix or eight inches. In watry &s;pots, we &s;ee bare ice, underneath the mo&s;s that covers them. No large cat|tle, brought to Obdor&s;kaja, ever lived &s;o long as five years. Hor&s;es can be kept no where north of Bere|&s;owa. Some were once brought to Obdor&s;kaja, but they did not live a year. For this rea&s;on, they keep only rein-deer which are here at home, and multiply very fa&s;t, in &s;pite of many di&s;orders, and the danger of wild bea&s;ts. Of cour&s;e, the&s;e animals make a con&s;iderable part of the property, both of the Ru&s;&s;ian and pagan inhabitants, of the&s;e northern lands.</P>
<P>Preparations for his further journey on the borders the glacial &s;ea, detained Mr. Surjef till the end of June. He wanted provi&s;ions, and attendants, who were here increa&s;ed by &s;ome Samojedes, and their wives, who offered their &s;ervice as guides, and as in|terpreters; and al&s;o a great number of rein-deer to change; for the&s;e animals &s;oon grow weary. The northern borders of Siberia, towards the coa&s;t of the frozen &s;ea, is, to the breadth of &s;ome hundred miles, a watry, mo&s;&s;y, and woodle&s;s mar&s;h, in which it is difficult to travel, even in &s;ummer-time; but, as I have ob&s;erved, there being, underneath the mo&s;s, ice, or
<PB N="285" REF="292">
frozen earth, well-trodden by rein-deer; the light &s;ledges of the Samojedes glide ea&s;ily away on the moi&s;t mo&s;s &s;urface, which would by no means bear a wheel.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of July, Mr. Surjef proceeded on his journey; and the next day he went, in a boat, down the Polni, and acro&s;s the Ob, and &s;ome other parts of the country, to the di&s;tance of 52 miles, pa&s;&s;ing &s;e|veral &s;ettlements, to a place where the rein-deer were in readine&s;s, to convey him on. In one &s;ettlement, con&s;i&s;ting of yourts, or tents, lives the governor of the Samojedes of Obdor&s;kaja, and the Ea&s;tjaiks. His fa|ther was pre&s;ented, at Mo&s;cow, by the pre&s;ent Em|pre&s;s, with robes, and a diploma; but died there be|fore his return.</P>
<P>On the 3d, Mr. Surjef, and his &s;uite, &s;et out with rein-deer, and took the land-road inwards from the river Ob, &s;traight north, over even, mar&s;hy lands, green with all &s;orts of reed-gra&s;s, and a few plants, with creeping willows, and large-leaved, dwarf birches <HI>(Betula nana),</HI> and &s;everal others, be&s;ides the <HI>Arbutus alpina;</HI> the more elevated, yet moi&s;t and loamy places, were ornamented with little, &s;cattered larches. They al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed many lakes, of various extent; and, the &s;ame day, reached the river Chaja, which flows from the mountains, into the gulph of the Ob. The breadth of this river was 18 fathoms, the &s;tream very rapid,
<PB N="286" REF="293">
and the water as bright as chry&s;tal. Travelling on, they reached, on the 6th of July, tho&s;e mountains which make part of the northern Ural. The road here was very difficult for the rein-deer, &s;ome of whom dropped, and could not be brought upon their legs again, even by bleeding, which operation the Samo|jedes perform under their tail. After a good day's journey (which, in &s;ummer-time, does not exceed 15 or 18 miles, on account of the frequent changing of the rein-deer, and the lo&s;s of time on that account), they cro&s;&s;ed two very rapid rivers, above 20 fathoms broad.</P>
<P>On the 8th, the Samojedes ran, till noon, before they could bring the rein-deer together, 70 of which were to go with them; and which, on account of tor|menting in&s;ects, had retreated into cool vallies; of cour&s;e, they could not get far that day. From the 19th to the 26th, they pa&s;&s;ed only a wild, barren country, full of capes and lakes, the icy &s;ea in &s;ight all the way, and pitching their tents at night, at which time they made fires to keep them&s;elves warm; and as they pa&s;&s;ed through a country where there was no wood, they were obliged to take wood with them. The water of the frozen &s;ea is &s;o cold, that a bather, in &s;ummer-time, could not &s;tay in it a few moments, without being benumbed; and it would be death to a delicate con&s;titution. Having travelled along the coa&s;t, more than three weeks, the extent of Mr. Surjef's route
<PB N="287" REF="294">
was completed; and, as the &s;everity of the weather oppo&s;ed a farther continuation, he &s;et out on his return the 28th of July, and reached Obdor&s;kaja again on the 14th of Augu&s;t.
<Q>In his tour he collected a number of plants and marine productions, but the names of them would be of little amu&s;ement to a general rea|der, as none were very curious or new.</Q>
Who would believe that the remains of elephants bones, &s;o fre|quently found in Siberia, &s;hould al&s;o be met with &s;o far north? Yet, it is certain, that the Samojedes find them in great abundance.</P>
<P>Before Mr. Surjef left the di&s;trict of Obdor&s;kaja, he made two other excur&s;ions, in &s;pite of the &s;evere, autumnal weather; one with rein-deer, towards the Uralian mountains; and the other, by water, to the gulph where the Ob flows into the ocean.</P>
<P>He &s;et out for the fir&s;t on the 18th of Augu&s;t, and returned to Obdor&s;kaja on the 22d. In his way he cro&s;&s;ed the river Sob, near its mouth, where it was 60 fathoms broad, and came to a granite mountain, who&s;e &s;ummit reached the clouds, and was covered with &s;now, that fell, between the full and new moon of July. During the night they travelled along this moun|tain, where the wolves fell upon the rein-deer, and &s;o di&s;per&s;ed them, that they could &s;carce get &s;ufficient to bring them back; for the&s;e deer accompany the &s;ledges, though turned loo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="295">The &s;econd tour he undertook, on the 25th of Augu&s;t, in a boat. On the 11th of September he returned from Obdor&s;kaja to Bere&s;owa; and, on his return to me, brought me a young &s;ea-bear alive, and an enormous buffalo's &s;kull, which he found in the earth, the breadth of which, between the horns, is 10 Paris inches, the breadth, before the horns, 13 inches, the length of the horn-holes, 18 inches, and the circumference, 12&frac34; inches.</P>
<P>Having thus given a &s;hort account of his tour, I &s;hall &s;peak of the pagan inhabitants, their hunting and fi&s;heries; and &s;hall begin with the O&s;tiacks, or Ea&s;tjaiks, of whom I tru&s;t I &s;hall give a more complete account, than any that has been hitherto given.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Ea&s;tjacks,</HI> At the beginning of the 17th cen|tury,</Q> &s;ays Dr. <HI>Gmelin,</HI> <Q>when the Ru&s;&s;ians had extended their conque&s;ts as far as the Jeni&s;ei, the&s;e Ea&s;tjaiks were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;arts, they now occupy along the banks of that river, and the rivers that empty into it. They were then near neigh|bours of the Samojedes, with whom they were in &s;ome mea&s;ure mixed, In 1608, they not only &s;ub|mitted to Ru&s;&s;ia them&s;elves, but their princes gave all their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to bring the people &s;ettled higher up, into the &s;ame &s;ubjection.</Q>
Tho&s;e on the river Ob, are one of the fir&s;t Siberian nations that were di&s;|covered
<PB N="289" REF="296">
and conquered by the Ru&s;&s;ians; and, like mo&s;t Siberian tribes, &s;ince their conque&s;t, have very much dimini&s;hed, by the &s;mall-pox, and other di&s;ea&s;es, for|merly unknown to them; yet they &s;till make a con|&s;iderable body of people, e&s;pecially in the di&s;trict of Bere&s;owa, extending up the Ob, as far as the di&s;tricts of Narym, and Surgut.</P>
<P>They are, in general, middling-&s;ized people, and &s;hort; not very &s;trong, and particularly thin and lean. Their faces are di&s;agreeable, pale, and flat, yet with|out any characteri&s;tic form. The ruddy and light-coloured hair that hangs about the head of the men, renders them &s;till more ugly. Among the women grown to full age, we &s;carce meet with a fine face. The Ea&s;tjaiks are timorous, &s;uper&s;titious, and &s;imple; but otherwi&s;e have a tolerable &s;hare of good-nature. They are, from their youth, laborious; being obliged to put up with a trouble&s;ome and bad way of living: but as &s;oon as they find them&s;elves a little above indi|gence, they are &s;lothful, e&s;pecially the men; and, in their whole, dome&s;tic management, very di&s;gu&s;tful and filthy.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s, both of men and women, is &s;ingular; and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of the &s;kins of animals, and furs, which they prepare them&s;elves. The richer wear &s;hirts; but the common people wear their leathern coats next their &s;kin. The man's dre&s;s is fir&s;t a narrow under-fur,
<PB N="290" REF="297">
with &s;leeves <HI>(Mauliza),</HI> which &s;carce reaches half-way the loins, having a hole above to put the head through, clo&s;e behind and before. This is commonly made with the &s;kin of a rein-deer fawn, which drops in &s;pring, and is put on, in&s;tead of a &s;hirt, with the hair inwards. The mo&s;t u&s;ual upper-fur, or garment, which is worn al&s;o in &s;ummer, when the weather is cold, is what they call <HI>Sarga,</HI> or <HI>Parka,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts of a rein-deer &s;kin, &s;ewed together, and worn with the hair inwards. It is almo&s;t like the Mauliza, except that behind the opening through which the head pa&s;&s;es, hangs a hood, which occa&s;ionally is thrown over the head. They generally border the hood, and &s;eams of the garment, with dog's-&s;kin; and is often worn, in &s;ummer, without the under fur. In the repre&s;ent|ation given, is an Ea&s;tjaik in his under-garment, and one in his upper-garment. In winter, they wear a fur over both; and al&s;o a cap, made of long-haired rein-deer &s;kin, called <HI>Gus.</HI> In &s;ummer-time, tho&s;e who wi&s;h to appear genteeler than ordinary, make them&s;elves a Mauliza of &s;everal pieces of cloth of va|rious colours, without lining, and bordered with a white dog's-&s;kin, or the tails of ice-foxes. Some, in the upper di&s;trict of the Ob, wear, in rainy weather, fi&s;h-&s;kin clothes, which, when they are hungry, and in want of other food, they put into a kettle, boil, and eat. The common breeches of the men are made of dyed rein-deer &s;kins, or quab-&s;kins; are cut to &s;it clo&s;e on them, but do not reach the knees. On their legs they

wear &s;hort &s;tockings, made of the fawn of the rein-deer; and, over the&s;e, boots, made of the foot-&s;kin of the &s;ame animal: the parts between the hoof, are fa&s;t|ened together for the &s;ole of their boots, being more &s;olid, and as preventing their &s;lipping on the &s;now. Such boots are exported by Ru&s;&s;ian merchants; and worn, when travelling in winter, both by Ru&s;&s;ians, and the people of Siberia.</P>
<P>The women wear, next their &s;kin, a kind of bed-gown, made of fur, and open all the way before; they are not very wide, yet &s;ufficiently &s;o as to lap over, and tie together. This is the only garment they wear: they take care to keep it clo&s;e before, but are not per|mitted to wear a girdle. They never wear any breeches; and, as they go bare-footed in &s;ummer, was it not for this fur-garment, they would be quite naked. In win|ter, at home, they wear &s;tockings, like the men; their hair is braided into two tre&s;&s;es behind, which hang down the back, and are tied together by a &s;tring. Added to this, the more wealthy fa&s;ten on the hair be|hind, two long &s;trips of good cloth, which reach to the joint of the knee, and are decorated with bra&s;s and cop|per-plates, repre&s;enting little hor&s;es, rein-deer, fi&s;h, and other figures. Tho&s;e that have not much hair, wind a piece of cloth about their heads, which cro&s;&s;es behind, and hangs down the back in two long &s;trips. Both men and women wear long pendants, in their ears, of beads of &s;everal colours, &s;trung on a wire, or
<PB N="292" REF="300">
&s;tring; and &s;everal men wear rings in their ears. As &s;oon as any one enters their tent, whether &s;trangers or relations, the women cover their whole heads with a linen veil, and will not be unveiled, even before their own mother. The&s;e veils are called, <HI>Wok&s;che,</HI> are worked on the borders, and ornamented with fringes. This is not an affected, but a real, blu&s;hing mode&s;ty in the Ea&s;tjaik girls and women; and, is carried &s;o far, that whenever a &s;tranger arrives, they endeavour to leave the tent, or hide them&s;elves in a corner.</P>
<P>Among the women it is reckoned an ornament to mark the back of the hands, and the fore-part of the arm, with various, blui&s;h figures and points: for this purpo&s;e, they draw the figure they mean to mark, upon their &s;kins, with foot, and prick it with needles till it bleeds; in &s;o doing, the prick given with the needle, leaves a blue &s;peck, and the figure being &s;o pricked all over, remains on the &s;kin in u&s;e. Men only prick on their hands that &s;ign, by which they are re|gi&s;tered in the tax-book; and which is con&s;idered, by other Siberians, un&s;killed in writing, as their &s;ignature, in law. The men will al&s;o, occa&s;ionally, prick all &s;orts of figures upon their &s;houlders, and other parts of their body, where they have &s;carified them&s;elves, in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s. As the Ea&s;tjaik women ornament them&s;elves, in this re&s;pect, as do the Tungu&s;e, and &s;ome nations in North America, &s;o have they, like the women in Kam&s;chatka, another ridiculous and peculiar cu&s;tom;
<PB N="293" REF="301">
that of wearing continually in the <HI>vagina,</HI> a tent twi&s;ted together, and made of &s;oft willow-ba&s;t &s;craped, which they occa&s;ionally remove, and often change; and, le&s;t this tent &s;hould fall from its &s;ituation, by the motion of the body, they have fancied a girdle <HI>(Worop),</HI> formed like tho&s;e cha&s;tity-girdles, invented by the jealou&s;y of our &s;outhern Europeans; from which pa&s;&s;es a band between the legs, covering the whole with a piece of birch-bark, &s;ewed to it;&mdash;a contrivance that, at certain times, is not without its u&s;e.</P>
<P>As other nomades are called &s;hepherds, the Ea&s;tjaiks may be called, a nation of fi&s;hermen; for fi&s;hing, dur|ing the whole &s;ummer, and in part of the winter, is their chief occupation. Hunting, and bird-catching, is an occa&s;ional employ; but de&s;erves a de&s;cription, equally with their fi&s;heries. Such being the life of an Ea&s;tjaik, it is naturally un&s;ettled; of cour&s;e, in &s;ummer-time, they move their habitations to places mo&s;t adapted for fi&s;hing; but, like the Ba&s;kirians, and &s;ome Siberian Tartars, have &s;ettled habitations in win|ter, to which they annually return.</P>
<P>A &s;ummer-tent <HI>(Chat)</HI> is made without much al|teration; the birch-bark which covers it, is carried with them in boats made of hollow trees, enlarged with boards fa&s;tened on them, as are al&s;o the poles with which they form their tents; the&s;e poles are &s;et clo&s;e toge|ther, in form of pyramids, and covered with the bark.
<PB N="294" REF="302">
In the&s;e boats they go, with their wives and children, and all that belongs to them&mdash;I &s;peak this only of &s;uch Ea&s;tjaiks as live beyond Bere&s;owa; for higher up the country, mo&s;t of them live in huts built of timber, have benches to &s;leep on, and, in many points, con|form to the Ru&s;&s;ian mode of living.</P>
<P>They chu&s;e, for their winter abodes, high and dry &s;pots, or the banks of neighbouring rivers. Here they build, with young timber, regular, &s;quare huts, &s;imilar to a Ru&s;&s;ian hou&s;e, but low; &s;ometimes half under|ground, and without a roof; in&s;tead of which, they cover the top with turf and leaves, leaving only a &s;quare air-hole, which they cover, in winter, with a tran&s;parent piece of ice. On each &s;ide of this hou&s;e, is an open pa&s;&s;age fenced in, in which are two clo&s;ets, where they keep their &s;uperfluous furs, and nece&s;&s;aries. Such huts are inhabited by more than one family; and the place, within the walls, is divided into as many apartments as there are families. Though nar|row and confined, the mother mu&s;t put up with one room, for the children and the whole family; who do their work before a &s;mall fire. It may ea&s;ily be con|ceived, that there cannot be the be&s;t order in &s;uch a room, where all things mu&s;t lie littered about: three, four, nay, &s;ix families, &s;hall live together in &s;uch a hut. Beyond Bere&s;owa, there are but few huts, or jourts, that have not thirty families in each. Tho&s;e mothers who have infants, have a cradle, made of
<PB N="295" REF="303">
birch-bark, before their hou&s;e, and fill it with any fine and brui&s;ed rotten wood they can find, which &s;erves the infant as a bed; and all the wet &s;uch infant makes, is ab&s;orbed in this wood-du&s;t. The cradle is covered with a piece of fur, fa&s;tened to it by &s;trings. The beds of &s;uch as are grown up, are made on the bare ground, with rein-deer furs and hay; except in &s;uch rooms where there are benches to lie on, underneath which their favourite dogs lie, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have whelps. Common &s;ledge-dogs lie without the hou&s;e; yet, when the ma&s;ter wants to go out, they are ad|mitted within, to be fed. In the centre of the jourt is a common fire, pretty large, where every one dre&s;&s;es his victuals when he plea&s;es, for they have no regular meals; and here they al&s;o roa&s;t the remains of what fi&s;h they leave, for the dogs. From this continual roa&s;ting, the cielings of their winter-dwellings are &s;o much covered with foot, that it hangs down like i&s;icles. One may ea&s;ily judge of the offen&s;ive &s;mell, and damps, at entering &s;uch a hut; from whence no dirt or filth, made by men or dogs, is removed; and where even children perform their occa&s;ional and nece&s;&s;ary wants, without going out.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e winter-huts, they build often, at a little di&s;tance from them, in the woods, places to &s;tore their provi&s;ions in <HI>(Laba&s;&s;y),</HI> where they leave all their furs, &s;kins, and other articles, for which they have no imme|diate u&s;e, without the lea&s;t care; and, what the place
<PB N="296" REF="304">
will not hold, is left without on their &s;ledges, and is perfectly &s;afe, no theft being ever committed.</P>
<P>The filthine&s;s of this nation cannot be painted &s;uffi|ciently di&s;gu&s;tful. Wa&s;hing of hands is unknown among them, except when the women open a fi&s;h, or take it out of the boiler; at which time they wa&s;h off the filth, and dry their hands in their furs. Men and animals eat out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, which is never cleaned. As their felt-like hair &s;warms with vermin, the mo&s;t filthy of all their actions is that of the women, at their lei&s;ure, picking &s;uch vermin from their hu&s;|band's heads, and killing them, with all po&s;&s;ible calm|ne&s;s, between their teeth. The rich Ea&s;tjaiks, how|ever, from imitation, are become &s;o cleanly, as to make a kind of &s;oap, becau&s;e what the Ru&s;&s;ians u&s;e is too &s;carce and dear, and not &s;trong enough to clean their hands, which are, comparatively &s;peaking, an inch thick with grea&s;e. This &s;oap is made by putting a good quantity of &s;harp a&s;hes into a kettle of water, and pouring, by degrees, fi&s;h-fat into the lye, which they boil together, till it &s;ettles, and becomes &s;oap. They then take it out in pieces, tie it up in rags, and, when they wa&s;h their hands, &s;queeze it like a &s;ponge: but the common Ea&s;tjaiks, have no &s;uch cleanly thing. One rea&s;on of their filthine&s;s is, that the women have too much dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s on their hands, and are con|&s;idered by their hu&s;bands rather as &s;laves than con&s;orts. The wife erects the tent, pulls it down, dre&s;&s;es the
<PB N="297" REF="305">
victuals, drys and mends her hu&s;band's clothes, and &s;erves him in every thing; and when the hu&s;band returns from hunting, or fi&s;hing, &s;he mu&s;t clean, and dre&s;s the fi&s;h. The men take nothing on them&s;elves, but the bu&s;ine&s;s of fi&s;hing and hunting.</P>
<P>The manner in which the&s;e women dre&s;s their &s;kins, is a good one, as they keep out the wet; I will, therefore, de&s;cribe it. Two tools are u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e; fir&s;t, a &s;mall iron, to the middle of which is fixed a wooden handle, and who&s;e two ends are crooked and &s;harp; with the&s;e they &s;crape the raw &s;kins, fir&s;t on the fle&s;h-&s;ide. This done, they chew fi&s;h-roe, or dried fi&s;h-bellies, in their mouths, and &s;pread it over the &s;kin, which is rolled up, and laid a&s;ide, to become moi&s;t. They then take another &s;craping iron, which looks like a narrow &s;ickle, with two wooden handles, one at each end; through the&s;e handles a rope is drawn, which they &s;ling round their foot, hold the Iron between their legs, and &s;crape the fle&s;h-&s;ide of the &s;kins clean. After this, they are dried in the tent, or hut, and worked &s;oft with the hands.
<Q>It is the chewed fi&s;h-roe that renders them impenetrable, by water.</Q></P>
<P>As it is only the more wealthy Ea&s;tjaiks, beyond Be|re&s;owa, that keep rein-deer; and we &s;ee other dome&s;tic cattle only among tho&s;e who live more to the &s;outh, towards Tobol&s;koi, mo&s;t of them mu&s;t live by fi&s;hing. During the whole &s;ummer, both young and old, are &s;o
<PB N="298" REF="306">
occupied; and even children are kept to work, accord|ing to their &s;trength, in this line. In this &s;ea&s;on, they have &s;uch an abundance of fi&s;h, that they eat nothing el&s;e; and they &s;eldom think of boiling, or roa&s;ting them, but cut off the fle&s;h, as it comes fre&s;h out of the water, &s;auce it with its blood, which flows plentifully from about the tail, when pricked with a needle; take one long &s;lice after another, into their mouths, cutting the bits very &s;kilfully below their lips; of cour&s;e, in &s;ummer, their mouths and clothes, &s;tink wor&s;e than a fi&s;h-market. In winter, they are fond of raw frozen fi&s;h; and are imitated in this by the neighbouring Ru&s;&s;ians, who eat it &s;o, as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>Far more fi&s;h is caught, in &s;ummer-time, than they are able to eat, or barter with the Ru&s;&s;ians. In the lower di&s;tricts of the Ob, the &s;maller &s;orts, which they do not know how to di&s;po&s;e of, are thrown away, and lie about in heaps untouched, even by the dogs. They pre&s;erve their fi&s;h in three different ways: the whole &s;ides of large whitings are taken from the bones, dried in the wind, and, to prevent putre&s;action, are half-roa&s;ted, and then tied up in bundles, and called <HI>Po&s;eem.</HI> The be&s;t of this kind of food is a fi&s;h of pa&s;|&s;age, caught in the Ob, which they call <HI>Muk&s;un.</HI> After drying, it is put into a kettle, and &s;tirred about on the fire till it becomes brown, then &s;towed away in ve&s;&s;els made of birch-bark, or the &s;tomach of the rein-deer.
<PB N="299" REF="307">
The bones are dried and roa&s;ted, and given to the dogs. <HI>Jutta</HI> is a food made like Po&s;eem, of &s;maller fi&s;hes; and put away in bags, made of the &s;kin of a &s;turgeon. <HI>Por&s;a</HI> is a little &s;pecies of &s;cale fi&s;h, &s;plit, and dried in the wind, and then, with the bones, pounded, as fine as flour. Po&s;eem is their mo&s;t u&s;ual food; but, to their gue&s;ts, they pre&s;ent Muk&s;un and Po&s;eem together; &s;o that one is u&s;ed as bread to the other. If the&s;e pro|vi&s;ions fail, they put up with the Jutta. Por&s;a is given dried, and &s;eldom boiled. Fre&s;h fi&s;h is only boiled for gue&s;ts, and what they leave, the family eats; and, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, they plunge their filthy hands into the kettle, up to their elbows. In winter, they make a &s;oup, or fi&s;h-broth, and put flour in it; this they learnt from the Ru&s;&s;ians, and throw it down their throats with large &s;poons. The entrails of fi&s;hes, the Ea&s;tjaiks make no u&s;e of, but boil out the fat, and di&s;po&s;e of it to the Ru&s;&s;ians, who eat it as butter, on their fa&s;t-days. The back-&s;inews are &s;eldom dre&s;&s;ed; the&s;e are u&s;ually eaten raw, without a knife. Eating with a knife is held ominous of un&s;ucce&s;sful fi&s;hing. The &s;ame thing they fear, if a fi&s;h's belly is &s;lit &s;trait down; the wo|men, therefore, cut them acro&s;s.</P>
<P>They make glue of the &s;turgeon's air-bladder, by cleaning it from the fat, drying it in the air, boiling it in water till it &s;wims at top, and then &s;kimming it, and cooling it in cold water.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="308">Hunting is one of the men's winter-occupations; and, in winter, they fi&s;h underneath the ice. In autumn, when the fir&s;t &s;now &s;alls, they hunt elks and rein-deer; and he that kills, makes a fea&s;t for his friends. The kidnies, lights, and other &s;oft parts, are eaten like the melt, raw; part of the fle&s;h is boiled, and the re&s;t &s;moked.</P>
<P>In winter, the Ea&s;tjaiks travel in their &s;now-&s;hoes, far into the de&s;arts and fore&s;ts, and do not return for &s;ome months, drawing their food with them, on &s;mall &s;ledges. Hunting weapons are all &s;orts of arrows; &s;ome with a fork-like point, others with bone-points, and others clubbed at the end, to kill &s;mall animals with. If they kill any large animals in any great number, they flea them, bury the fle&s;h in the deep &s;now, in a &s;pot they can find again, and fetch it at &s;ome other time, with rein-deer, or dogs. They will eat the fle&s;h of bears, foxes, &s;quirrels, and dead car|ca&s;es, without di&s;gu&s;t. When an Ea&s;tjaik is expo&s;ed to &s;evere cold, pain and hunger, he has recour&s;e to tobacco, which does him a great deal of &s;ervice; &s;o that they are fond of &s;moking, and taking &s;nuff: and as their tobacco is not very &s;trong, they quicken it with the mo&s;t alkaline a&s;hes of birch, and a&s;p &s;purges. After filling their no&s;trils with &s;nuff, they &s;top them with &s;craped willow-ba&s;t, &s;o that the pungent, &s;harp juice, &s;hall rai&s;e a kind of inflammation in the face, which keeps off the fro&s;t. I mu&s;t not omit, here, their &s;u|per&s;tition
<PB N="301" REF="309">
in hunting. When an Ea&s;tjaik goes a hunt|ing, he wi&s;hes to &s;neeze the day before, and con&s;iders this as a happy pre&s;age; but &s;hould he find him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to &s;neeze the morning he &s;ets out, he will make all po&s;&s;ible grimaces to prevent it, and &s;hould he &s;neeze after all, nothing can exceed his vexation, con|ceiving that, every time he &s;neezes, will deprive him of part of his &s;port for that day; nay, &s;ome, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, will not go out at all.</P>
<P>In &s;pring, the birds of pa&s;&s;age claim their attention, and afford them delicious food. Their manner of catching them, &s;hall be circum&s;tantially related.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their unnatural food, their drink, (except brandy, which they barter for with the Ru&s;&s;ians, and drink on the &s;pot) is water only; I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding this, they are a healthy people, and, among youth, we &s;eldom hear of di&s;ea&s;e. But if, from age and infirmities, they are unable to follow their occupations, they are commonly attacked with &s;uch &s;tubborn, &s;corbutic and paralytic di&s;orders, as never to ri&s;e again. They know nothing of inflammatory com|plaints, except the &s;mall-pox, which makes dreadful ravage among children, when it comes. Their man|ner of living mu&s;t needs render this di&s;order fatal; and, if it enters a village, grown people &s;eldom e&s;cape. Some, however, remain free all their lives. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e has al&s;o found its way among
<PB N="302" REF="310">
them; but is not &s;o infectious, as might be &s;up|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Medicines they are unacquainted with. Their be&s;t cure in fits, &s;wellings, and inflammations, is &s;carifica|tion, or burning, on the di&s;ea&s;ed part, a piece of birch-&s;purge; and being of opinion, that the remedy mu&s;t be applied to the place where the evil is lodged, they fir&s;t take a burning coal, and hold it about the di&s;ea&s;ed part, on different places of the &s;kin, till they find a part where the patient does not feel the fire &s;o &s;en&s;ibly; there they apply it, and keep it till the &s;kin is burnt through, and bur&s;ts: the patient &s;uffering this burning, with the patience of a &s;toic.</P>
<P>They cure ob&s;tructions; with large &s;poonfuls of fi&s;h|fat; and, in dangerous ca&s;es, take crow's eyes. Both the&s;e are u&s;ed as an emetic and purge. The gall of a white &s;ea-bear, and bear's heart, are al&s;o medicines of renown among them. Dried gall is chiefly u&s;ed in &s;ick|ne&s;s among children, or complaints of the belly, and the venereal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tjaiks, particularly beyond Bere&s;owa, who adhere &s;till to pagani&s;m, take as many wives as they can afford. It is legal among them to marry their brother's widow, their &s;tep-mother, or &s;tep-daughter, and other female relations. They are fond of marrying &s;i&s;ters of other families; and believe that, men's mar|rying
<PB N="304" REF="311">
with a wife's &s;i&s;ter, brings good luck, and, by doing this, they pay the father only half the price, or kalym, fir&s;t paid; but they hold it &s;inful and di&s;grace|ful, to marry relations of the &s;ame name: yet they at|tend only to the male line. If a woman has married into another family, and has borne a daughter, the brother of the mother, or his children, may legally marry that daughter. In &s;hort, all marriages are legal, if only the father of the bride, and bridegroom, are of different families.</P>
<P>When an Ea&s;tjaik goes a courting, he chu&s;es, from among his neare&s;t relations and friends, &s;ome com|panions of his own age, and one to be the negotiator; goes with them to his &s;weetheart's dwelling, and enters the hut without ceremony. A father who has a mar|riageable daughter, &s;eeing &s;uch a company arrive, rea|dily gue&s;&s;es the rea&s;on; therefore, makes no que&s;tion, but treats them with what his tent will afford. When the gue&s;ts have filled their bellies, they retire to an|other tent, and from thence the bridegroom &s;ends his &s;uitor with the propo&s;als, and enquires the kalym, or price to be paid, The negotiation being entered into, the poor &s;uitor runs to and fro, from one tent to the other, to &s;ettle matters between the two, till the agree|ment is concluded on; then the bridegroom goes him|&s;elf, and pays part of the kalym, the whole being &s;el|dom paid at once, it being proportioned to the fortune the father gives with his daughter. A rich, Ea&s;tjaik
<PB N="304" REF="312">
girl, is not married, without a gift of 100 rein-deer, and an a&s;&s;ortment of all kinds of furs. The fir&s;t in&s;tal|ment being paid, the bridegroom directs the father to have a bed prepared for him in his hut, and to have his daughter ready. If the father-in-law agrees to this, and accepts the fir&s;t payment, the bridegroom comes, that night, and lays on the &s;pot, or bed, appointed for him. Some time after the bride lies down near him, on a &s;eparate bench, and covered with a particular fur, till the fires are put out. Next morning, the girl's mother enquires of the bridegroom, whether he is &s;atisfied with her daughter. If he replies in the affirmative, he mu&s;t pre&s;ent the mother with a gar|ment and a rein-deer; and the mother then cuts the rein-deer's &s;kin on which the young couple lay, into pieces, and &s;preads it around, in triumph: but &s;hould the bridegroom be di&s;&s;atisfied, the mother gives him a rein-deer. The bridegroom, after this, &s;leeps with his bride; but cannot take her home, till the whole of the kalym, or purcha&s;e-money, is paid. Sometimes, it &s;hall happen, that, when the father is weak or ill, and cannot follow, the hu&s;band &s;hall take away his wife, before the &s;um agreed on is paid; in &s;uch ca&s;es, the father takes the opportunity, at &s;ome future time, when his daughter comes to pay him a vi&s;it, to detain her, and force the hu&s;band to pay what is owing.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="313">No married woman can appear before her father-in-law whil&s;t &s;he lives; nor the bridegroom, before his mother in-law, until he has children. They mu&s;t avoid them as much as po&s;&s;ible; and, if they chance to meet them, mu&s;t turn their backs, and cover their faces. Girls, in Ea&s;tjaik families, have no names; the hu&s;band, therefore, calls his con&s;ort, <HI>wife</HI> (Jemi); and the wo|men call their hu&s;bands, <HI>man</HI> (Tahe).</P>
<P>Though the uncivilized Ea&s;tjaik does not con&s;ider his wife but as a nece&s;&s;ary, dome&s;tic animal, and &s;carcely favours her with a good word for all her hard labour; yet he dare not &s;trike her, even for the greate&s;t crime, unle&s;s he has the con&s;ent of her father: for, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the provoked wife would run to her parents, and per&s;uade her father to return the kalym to his &s;on-in-law, and &s;he would marry &s;ome other man.</P>
<P>The&s;e people know little about jealou&s;y; they are much addicted to be&s;tiality; and their marriages are &s;eldom very prolific. Few fathers have more than three or four children; probably, a father's neglect of his children, may &s;horten their days, and rob him of part of them. Though mothers &s;hew a greater fond|ne&s;s, and will let their infants &s;uck as long as they like, even to the fifth year. The women here are ea&s;ily delivered; and the after-birth, and willow|ba&s;t, on which they lie, is put into a box of birch|bark, and, with &s;ome meat or fi&s;h added to it, &s;u|per&s;titiou&s;ly
<PB N="306" REF="314">
hung upon a tree, in &s;ome di&s;tant wood. It is &s;aid, that &s;hould a poor, Ea&s;tjaik woman be deli|vered of a child on the road, when travelling, and where they cannot &s;top long for want of victuals, the hu&s;band will give her a good do&s;e of fi&s;h-glue boiled, and this will enable her to proceed.</P>
<P>They have particular burying-places of their own, called <HI>Chalas.</HI> A corp&s;e is not kept long above-ground; he that dies in the morning, is interred at noon. Their graves are made, generally, only two feet deep; becau&s;e, in mo&s;t places, the frozen ground is too hard to be dug into deeper. The decea&s;ed is dre&s;&s;ed in his be&s;t clothes, according to the &s;ea&s;on of the year; is put on a bench, and all things near him which he u&s;ed; for in&s;tance, his knife, axe, tobacco-horn filled, &amp;c. except his flint and fire-&s;teel, which are only given to the dead, carved in wood. The relations and neigh|bours of the decea&s;ed, a&s;&s;emble in his jourt, and de|plore him with great howling. The women &s;it toge|ther, with their faces veiled; and the men &s;tand, la|menting over the body. In&s;tead of a coffin, they bring a little boat, who&s;e fore and hind part is cut off, put the decea&s;ed, with all his things, into it, and carry him to his grave. Men are borne by men; and wo|men are carried by women only, to the place of inter|ment, which is u&s;ually on &s;ome height. In the latter ca&s;e, the corp&s;e is followed by &s;ome men to dig the grave, and is interred with &s;hrieks of woe. The corp&s;e
<PB N="307" REF="315">
of a man is followed by three of the be&s;t and mo&s;t fa|vourite rein-deer he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, dre&s;&s;ed, and harne&s;&s;ed, in &s;ledges, and led on by men. As &s;oon as the body is interred, and covered with earth, they put a cord round the hind-legs of the deer, which two men pull, whil&s;t four others run them through the bodies, on all &s;ides, with pointed poles. When rich men are buried, they kill many more rein-deer, putting &s;lings about their necks and feet, and beating them about the back with poles, till they drop down dead. The&s;e animals, &s;acrificed to the decea&s;ed, remain on the grave; their hou&s;ings are laid on a kind of &s;caffold, made over it with bu&s;hes, and the &s;ledges are placed &s;lanting up again&s;t it. Near the grave, they dre&s;s a funeral meal; and when tho&s;e who attend are &s;atisfied, carry the re|mainder home, and divide it among the neighbours, in remembrance of their decea&s;ed friend; and the re|lations will afterwards &s;ometimes celebrate &s;uch meals of remembrance.</P>
<P>Before the Ea&s;tjaiks were &s;ubject to the Ru&s;&s;ian em|pire, they had little princes among them, who&s;e dig|nity was hereditary. Some of their po&s;terity are &s;till in being, but not much re&s;pected, living in the man|ner of the common people, by their labour. If the&s;e princes left no male i&s;&s;ue, the elders and mo&s;t wealthy, cho&s;e a &s;ucce&s;&s;or from among them&s;elves. If any di&s;|pute happens among the people, the&s;e &s;ettle it by ar|bitration, or refer the matter to their princes; but if
<PB N="308" REF="316">
the cau&s;e is brought before any Ru&s;&s;ian court of judi|cature, it is adju&s;ted by the evidence of the parties, and the following oath is u&s;ually admini&s;tered. A wooden idol being brought, the defendant is reminded of the danger of taking a fal&s;e oath, and con&s;trained to cut off the idol's no&s;e, with an axe, or knife, and in|jure it other ways; during this, he mu&s;t repeat, after the interpreter, the following words:
<Q>If I do not &s;peak the truth, in this cau&s;e, let my no&s;e be cut off in the &s;ame manner; let me be hewn in pieces by an axe; let the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t tear me; and every misfortune come upon me!</Q>
By the &s;ame oath the witne&s;&s;es are &s;worn; and, out of &s;uper&s;titious fear, will rather confe&s;s they are in the wrong, than expo&s;e them|&s;elves to the puni&s;hment of their gods. If they are to &s;wear allegiance to a new &s;overeign, they are a&s;&s;em|bled in little circles, an axe is placed in the middle, with which a bear, or bear-&s;kin, has been cut in pieces; and each per&s;on is pre&s;ented with a bit of bread, on the point of a knife; during this, he is to take the oath of allegiance, as follows:&mdash;<Q>If I do not remain faith|ful to the Empre&s;s, to the end of my life; if I re|volt, or do not pay my tribute; or if I leave my country, or do any other act of perfidy; let me torn by the bear, or choked with this bread I eat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the Engli&s;h Cor&s;ned oath. Hence the expre&s;&s;ion&mdash; "May this mor&s;el be my la&s;t!"</NOTE>; let the axe cut off my head; or let me be killed by this
<PB N="309" REF="317">
knife.</Q>
This done, they kneel down about a bear's &s;kin, and lay hold of it with their teeth, biting it; and many, to &s;hew their zeal, will tear out the hairs with their teeth. Similar obligations, on oath, are cu&s;tom|ary, with a bear's &s;kin, among mo&s;t of the heathens, in Siberia.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tjaik language is like that of Finland, and the Woguls. There are al&s;o divers dialects of this language. Among the Finni&s;h dialects, there is none more like the Ea&s;tjaik, than the Mordvine. As an example, I will give a li&s;t of words, in the Ea&s;tjaik, Wogulian, and Mordvine languages; and the &s;imi|arity will be readily &s;een.</P>

<P><PB N="310" REF="318">The blinde&s;t and coar&s;e&s;t idolatry is &s;till the reigning religion of the Ea&s;tjaiks; even of many that are bap|tized. Tho&s;e who, among their magicians, profe&s;s pa|gani&s;m, have their idols at home; which are clum&s;ily carved puppets, with a human face, clothed with rags, and put in the be&s;t corner of the tent. Before each idol, they place a little wooden box, in which the wor|&s;hiper pre&s;ents his god with little pre&s;ents, and keeps always for him a horn-full of &s;nuff, and &s;craped wil|low-ba&s;t; but if this little, wooden god &s;hould find him|&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to take a pinch of &s;nuff, he may &s;tuff his no&s;trils with the ba&s;t, in the Ea&s;tjaik mode. They in|du&s;triou&s;ly &s;mear the idol's mouth with fi&s;h-fat, and do him every honour, in their way. Some Ea&s;tjaiks have deified pieces of logwood, little boxes, and other things, they have bought from the Ru&s;&s;ians. Such things they decorate in the be&s;t manner they can, with rings and ribbands, and wor&s;hip them, as others do their wood|en puppets. It is truly laughable, to &s;ee the effect of a Ru&s;&s;ian traveller's taking out at night, when they are all a&s;leep, the tobacco from the horn, and leaving the horn in its place; the &s;imple Ea&s;tjaik, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;es that the idol has taken all the &s;nuff, is &s;ur|pri&s;ed at it, and thinks that he mu&s;t certainly have been hunting. It can &s;carcely be credited, that &s;uch a people could be &s;o blind and ridiculous, as to knock down the idol from its place, and break it in pieces, by various methods, when they are in trouble, and the god will not &s;uccour them; though they held the idol
<PB N="311" REF="319">
in the greate&s;t veneration before. This is often in u&s;e among the Ea&s;tjaiks; but &s;carce ever &s;een in any other pagan nation in Siberia.</P>
<P>They al&s;o deify, in a certain manner, their decea&s;ed relations; making wooden images, to repre&s;ent &s;ome dead per&s;on they re&s;pected; and &s;et, at the remem|berance-meals, their portion before them. Women that loved their hu&s;bands, will take the&s;e puppets to-bed at night, dre&s;s them, and never omit plac|ing &s;ome victuals be&s;ore them, when they eat them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tjaiks wor&s;hip, al&s;o, certain trees and mountains, that have excited devout ideas; or have been con&s;idered as &s;uch by their magicians. They never pa&s;s &s;uch trees, or mountains, without &s;hooting an arrow at them; which is a kind of wor&s;hip they pay to the&s;e objects. But the greate&s;t adoration, and mo&s;t common, great &s;acrifices, are only made to certain eminent people, con&s;ecrated by their magicians. To the&s;e they fly for refuge, in extraordinary ca&s;es of mis|fortune, or danger; wherein the &s;orcerers play the principal part, in order to bring the poor people, by their impo&s;itions, under a blind obedience.</P>
<P>The idols, at pre&s;ent wor&s;hiped by all the Ea&s;t|jaiks of the river Ob, and the neighbouring Samo|jedes, are in the environs of the tents of Wa&s;ar&s;kaja,
<PB N="312" REF="320">
a great way beyond Obdor&s;kaja. They &s;tand in a woody vale; where they are carefully watched, and every pa&s;&s;age to them concealed from the Ru&s;&s;ians. Before the&s;e idols, of which there are two, they a&s;&s;em|ble, in great numbers, to perform their &s;acrifices. One is dre&s;&s;ed in a male dre&s;s, the other in a female; and both are &s;plendidly decked out in the Ea&s;tjaik way, and no cloth, or furs, &s;pared, to make them complete. Their garments are richly ornamented with bra&s;s and iron plates, in form of animals; and, on their heads, are &s;ilver garlands. Each &s;tands on a &s;elected tree, in his own jurt, or hut; the trunks of the trees are covered with cloth, and other &s;tuff; and, at the top, decorated with a white, iron plate, with a bell hanging on it, that is &s;haken, and rung by the wind. Quivers and bows are al&s;o hung on the tree of the male pagod; and on all the adjacent trees, a number of &s;kins of rein-deer victims, and other &s;orts of furs. Round about the idols is a great deal of Ea&s;tjaik, hou&s;hold uten&s;ils; as kettles, &s;poons, cups, tobacco|horns, &amp;c. The men pay their devotions only to the male idol; but the women &s;ometimes a&s;&s;emble before the female idol, led on by a magician of their own &s;ex, and bring her &s;acrifices and pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tjaiks formerly had, in many places in the woods, trees, they wor&s;hipped, and pre&s;ented with &s;kins and &s;acrifices; but finding that Co&s;&s;ack tra|vellers made no &s;cruple to &s;ave the&s;e &s;kins, &s;u&s;pended
<PB N="313" REF="321">
in the air, from putrefaction, by putting them to a better u&s;e; they contented them&s;elves with cutting large branches of the&s;e trees, dre&s;&s;ing them up, and erecting them in more &s;ecure places, and there bringing them pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>All the di&s;tricts who&s;e environs are con&s;ecrated to an idol, are &s;pared by the Ea&s;tjaiks; &s;o as that they nei|ther fell wood, or make hay, in &s;uch places; nor will they hurt a fi&s;h, or drink there, le&s;t they &s;hould pro|voke the anger of the god. If they pa&s;s &s;uch a di&s;trict by water, they take care nor to come too near the &s;hore, nor touch the land with their oars; and &s;hould the di&s;trict be exten&s;ive, they take &s;ufficient water with them, before they come to it; as they would rather die with thir&s;t, than attempt to drink any water from &s;uch a con&s;ecrated river.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e places where idols were formerly wor|&s;hiped by their ance&s;tors, are now well known to po&s;terity; and if &s;ome new place is cho&s;en, it is from the caprice of tho&s;e magicians that are mo&s;t re&s;pected. A di&s;trict full of game, &s;hall be con&s;ecrated, by art|ful magicians, to an idol; and a tree, on which an eagle hath built her ne&s;t for two years together, is de|clared &s;acred; and they dare not mole&s;t that eagle. There could be no greater offence, than for a pa&s;&s;en|ger to kill &s;uch eagle; and the teachers and &s;upporters of &s;o ab&s;urd a &s;uper&s;tition, are the rogui&s;h magicians,
<PB N="314" REF="322">
or &s;chamans. Any officers; &s;ent by Imperial command, to make any the lea&s;t reform, which does not plea&s;e the Ea&s;tjaiks, puts the whole nation into &s;uch terror and con&s;ternation, and the magicians take the advantage of the&s;e times, to relate fictitious dreams to the peo|ple, or threaten them with the anger of the gods, or &s;ome heavier puni&s;hment; and they get from them as many pre&s;ents, by way of &s;acrifice, as will maintain them a long time. The&s;e &s;chamans are commonly &s;o cunning, in the beginning, as to tread them&s;elves a path to &s;uch a re&s;pectable &s;ituation, as they &s;tand in with the&s;e people, by relations and interpretations of dreams; and afterwards improve them&s;elves, in the arts of knavery and deception. Super&s;tition has &s;o &s;trong an influence on the minds of &s;ome people, that they are often terrified at the greate&s;t trifles; as I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to &s;hew.</P>
<P>The opportunities to practi&s;e magic knowledge here, are ca&s;es of misfortune, horrid dreams, un&s;ucce&s;sful hunting, or fi&s;hing, and other accidents. The Ea&s;t|jaik &s;orcerers make u&s;e of a drum, like mo&s;t Siberian &s;chamans; and, in their magic &s;pells, make horrible contortions of their bodies and faces, before large fires; till the devils which they have brought forth, as they pretend, have given them a proper an&s;wer. All tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent, make, during the contortions, an un|interrupted noi&s;e with kettles, cups, &amp;c. as loud as they can, and cry out, till they fancy they &s;ee a blue
<PB N="315" REF="323">
&s;moke, over the magician's head; who, after the fit, feigns to be, for &s;ome time, weak, and out of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The other principal occupation of the &s;orcerers is, ordering the general offerings, or &s;acrifices; which they command the timid people to make, as they plea&s;e, in all extraordinary ca&s;es. I do not &s;peak of little offerings; as the Ea&s;tjaiks, of them&s;elves, often carry the idol &s;mall pre&s;ents and ornaments, game, fre&s;h fi&s;h, and pro&s;trate them&s;elves before it; and, after performing &s;upplications, boil the &s;acrifice, and &s;mear the idol's mouth with the fat, or broth: but I &s;peak of greater &s;acrifices, where many rein-deer are killed for the gods, and where the &s;chaman is pre&s;ent. &mdash;The following then is the ceremony: Having bound the rein-deer's legs together, the &s;chaman &s;tands before the idol, and bawls out as loud as he can, the &s;uppli|cation of him who offers to the gods; and &s;o do the by-&s;tanders. Then &s;ome one, with a bent bow and arrow, &s;tands before the rein-deer, and, when the ma|gician, with a &s;taff, gives the &s;ignal on the head of the victim, he &s;hoots it with the arrow, and another kills it outright, with a pointed lance, or pole. They next take the animal by the tail, and drag it thrice round the pagod, cut it open, &s;queeze out the blood from the heart, and &s;mear the idol's mouth therewith. The head and &s;kin is &s;u&s;pended on an adjacent tree; and the meat boiled, and eaten with &s;houts of joy. What|ever
<PB N="316" REF="324">
the Ea&s;tjaiks think of, &s;erves for a &s;ong, if only bawled in a &s;inging tone; and &s;uch are the hymns of the&s;e &s;acrifices. At parting, every one cries out as loud as he can, waves his arms in the air, and thus gives his idol thanks, and a farewell. The meat not eaten is taken home, and divided among their wives, child|ren, and neighbours; fir&s;t grea&s;ing the mouths of their dome&s;tic idols with the fat.</P>
<P>When great and general &s;acrifices are to be per|formed, the rich Ea&s;tjaiks drive their be&s;t rein-deer, in whole herds, to be killed; and &s;carcely keep tho&s;e who are mo&s;t u&s;eful to them. In &s;uch ca&s;es, they know how to &s;laughter the poor victims, barbarou&s;ly and expeditiou&s;ly; for the &s;ooner a rein-deer falls and dies, the more acceptable to the idol is the offering &s;uppo&s;ed to be. A rich man would blu&s;h, on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, to offer le&s;s than eight or ten rein-deer. Be|&s;ides this, they hang up the be&s;t furs they have to the idol, as a pre&s;ent, and leave them a prey to wind and weather. Offerings are al&s;o made in &s;evere &s;ickne&s;&s;es, according to the number ordered by the magicians. The victims are placed before the door of the patient's hut, and giving into the hand of the rich man a rope, tied on the rein-deer's foot, the friends and relations, &s;tanding with the magician, on the out&s;ide of the hut, call upon the idol, till the patient draws the rope, by accident, or intentionally, which is looked upon as a &s;ignal to kill the victim, and he is &s;laughtered accord|ingly.
<PB N="317" REF="325">
Of &s;uch &s;acrifices, the &s;kin is de&s;tined for do|me&s;tic u&s;e, the head and horns put upon a pale, the fle&s;h eaten, and the forehead and afflicted parts of the &s;ick man, grea&s;ed with the &s;at.</P>
<P>When the Ea&s;tjaiks have &s;hewn their prowe&s;s in killing a bear, the following ceremony attends it. The &s;kin is hung upon a high tree, all &s;orts of reverence is paid it, and the be&s;t apologies made to the animal for its being, killed. By doing this, they hope to avert, in a polite way, the injury which might otherwi&s;e be done them by the &s;pirit of the animal.
<Q>Some &s;uch cu&s;toms are prevalent in Lapland.</Q>
All, or mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms, are the &s;ame among all old Siberian pagans.</P>
<P>Particular mention de&s;erves to be made of the dances of the Ea&s;tjaiks, which are quite national, and truly remarkable. I &s;aw them performed by Ru&s;&s;ians, who dwelt long among the Ea&s;tjaiks; and their ridiculous attitudes cannot better be compared, than to a bur|le&s;que pantomime. They divert them&s;elves thus at their entertainments; and particularly when they have obtained a good deal of brandy, by barter, from the Ru&s;&s;ians. It is the men only who dance, the wo|men are merely &s;pectators; and it requires no &s;mall adroitne&s;s, &s;trength, and agility; for they always dance till they &s;weat. In the&s;e dances, they repre&s;ent the
<PB N="318" REF="326">
proceedings of their ance&s;tors, in chace of a variety of animals and birds, and even a fi&s;hing. Sometimes, they imitate the conduct and walk of the mo&s;t im|portant animals and birds; and &s;atirize the gait of their neighbours, all in mu&s;ical cadence; which the player varies, according to the various imitations. In a very droll and laughable manner, do they repre&s;ent the chace of the &s;able, the manners of the crane and elk, and the flight and preying of the mou&s;e-hawk, the man|ner of the Ru&s;&s;ian women wa&s;hing them&s;elves, and other plea&s;ant &s;ubjects. The mo&s;t difficult repre&s;entation appeared to me to be, that of the crane; when the dancer &s;quats down, hides him&s;elf in a fur, the collar of which he fa&s;tens round a long &s;tick, which at top re|&s;embles the head of a crane; and thus &s;quatting, and almo&s;t bent double, he dances, and imitates, with the &s;tick, all the motions of a crane. At the repre&s;entation of the elk, the mu&s;ic imitates the &s;everal actions of the animal, walking, trotting, and galloping; and the dancer makes all the grimaces of that animal, when he is throwing about his eyes, in &s;earch of the hunt&s;man who is after him. No one could &s;uppo&s;e &s;o much &s;kill, and &s;o many well-fancied attitudes, among &s;o rude a nation. Their mo&s;t favourite dances are, &s;atyric repre&s;entations; and they are fond of ridiculing particular per&s;ons in &s;ongs, the extemporaneous effu&s;ions of their own brain, when either drunk, or jovial.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="327">Be&s;ides the&s;e dances and &s;ongs, they divert them|&s;elves, occa&s;ionally, with &s;tories, which turn &s;ometimes on love-adventures, and &s;ometimes on old, incredible, boa&s;ted feats of heroi&s;m. They tell one of a mighty and valiant Ea&s;tjaik, who, going a courting, travelled from Obdor&s;kaja to a di&s;tance of 340 miles, beyond the So&s;wa, in 24 hours, without any change of rein-deer; and, not being able to agree with the father of his girl, carried her off in a little time; and being, on this ac|count, obliged to fight with her relations, killed, with his own hand, &s;everal thou&s;ands of them, and &s;o on. This piece of chivalry is believed, by the Ea&s;tjaiks, as true: &s;ome part of it may be &s;o; but it is converted into fable, by po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ical in&s;truments of this people are, the <HI>Dombra,</HI> exactly like the Wogulian lute; and &s;ome few &s;pecies of little harps, called <HI>Dernoboi,</HI> which con&s;i&s;t of a long-&s;ounding triangular box, covered on the top with a &s;ounding-board, and &s;trung with 30 &s;trings; which the player touches boldly, pre&s;&s;ing down the thin-&s;ounding board with his thumb, to give the tones a wavering motion. To one end of this box, is fixed a &s;wan's neck.</P>
<P>To &s;trangers the Ea&s;tjaiks are very ho&s;pitable; and do not know how to pay &s;ufficient honour and re&s;pect to their gue&s;ts. If they have any rein-deer, they will
<PB N="320" REF="328">
kill one immediately, and &s;et before their friend, the tongue, brains, and brea&s;t, boiled in their way, and con&s;idered, by them, as delicacies. After the meal, they will make their gue&s;t &s;uch a pre&s;ent as they can afford, without expecting any return.</P>
