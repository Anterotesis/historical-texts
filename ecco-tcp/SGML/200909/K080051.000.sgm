<HEAD>LECTURE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>IT is my de&s;ign in the following Lec|tures, to inve&s;tigate the ORDERS OF FREE MASONRY; and under di&s;tinct heads, to arrange my ob&s;ervations on the nature of this Society.</P>
<P>On my initiation, I was &s;truck with the ceremonials; and immediately appre|hended, there was more conveyed by them, than appeared to the vulgar eye: as I attended to the matter, I was con|vinced my fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions were ju&s;t; and by my re&s;earches, to di&s;cover their implications, I pre&s;ume, I have acquired &s;ome degree of knowledge, touching the
<PB N="2" REF="8">
Origin of Ma&s;onry, the rea&s;ons of its &s;everal in&s;titutions, the meaning of its various &s;ymbols, and their import; toge|ther with the progre&s;s of the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is known to the world, but more particularly to my Brethren, that there are three degrees of MASONS&mdash;AP|PRENTICES, CRAFTSMEN, and MAS|TERS&mdash;the initiation to, and &s;everal advancements from, the order of AP|PRENTICES, will nece&s;&s;arily lead my ob&s;ervations to three di&s;tinct channels.</P>
<P>How the &s;everal my&s;teries are revealed to MASONS, they alone know&mdash;&s;o &s;tead|fa&s;tly have the FRATERNITY pre|&s;erved their Faith, for many ages, that this remains a &s;ecret to the world, in defiance of the corruptions and vices of Mankind.</P>
<P>In order to comprehend our PRO|FESSION, we mu&s;t look back into the remote&s;t antiquity, and from thence col|lect the &s;everal parts, which have been united in the forming of our Order&mdash;in the fir&s;t place, we mu&s;t give our atten|tion
<PB N="3" REF="9">
to the Creation of Man, and the &s;tate of our fir&s;t Parent in the Garden of Eden.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>Gene&s;is&mdash;ch. i. ver. 26.</BIBL> And God &s;aid let us make man in our image, after our likene&s;s.</Q>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. 27.</BIBL>&mdash; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.</Q>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. 31.</BIBL>&mdash;And God &s;aw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</Q>
<Q><BIBL>Ch. 2. ver. 7.</BIBL>&mdash;And the Lord God formed the man of the du&s;t of the ground, and breathed into his no&s;trils the breath of life; and man became a living &s;oul.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, when Adam came from out the hand of his Creator, the Image of God, from whom he im|mediately proceeded, that he was per|fect in Symetry and Beauty; that he was made in the highe&s;t degree of excel|lence human nature was capable of on earth&mdash;calculated for Regions of Felicity and Paradi&s;e, where &s;in or &s;orrow had not known exi&s;tence&mdash;made in &s;uch per|fection of body and mind, that he could endure the pre&s;ence of God; and was capable of conver&s;ing with the Almighty
<PB N="4" REF="10">
face to face<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, ch. ii. ver. 16&mdash;17&mdash;19.&mdash;Ch. iii. ver. 9&mdash;10&mdash;11&mdash;12&mdash;17.</NOTE>&mdash;&s;o much was he &s;uperior to the cho&s;en ones of I&s;rael.&mdash;He was endowed with under&s;tanding &s;uitable to his &s;tation, as one whom the Almighty deigned to vi&s;it; and his heart was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the VIRTUES unpolluted: endowments of an heavenly temper&mdash; his hours were full of wi&s;dom, exulta|tion, and tran&s;port&mdash;the Book of Nature was revealed to his comprehen&s;ion, and all her my&s;teries were open to his un|der&s;tanding&mdash;he knew whence and what he was.&mdash;Even this was but a minute degree of his capacity; for a&s;toni&s;hing as it may appear to us, yet it is an uncontrovertable truth, that he had a competent knowledge of the mighty, the tremendous CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE;&mdash;he &s;aw him with his natural eyes, he heard his voice, he un|der&s;tood his laws, and was pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>To this fountain of human perfection and wi&s;dom, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look
<PB N="5" REF="11">
back, for all the &s;cience and learning which ble&s;&s;ed the earlie&s;t ages of the world&mdash;calculated for &s;uch exalted feli|city and elevated enjoyments, placed in regions of peace, where Angels mini&s;tred and the Divinity walked abroad, was the parent of mankind.</P>
<P>But alas he fell!&mdash;his di&s;obedience forfeited all that glory and felicity&mdash;and horrible to recount, even in the mid&s;t of this exalted &s;tate, SATAN prevailed!</P>
<P>If we pre&s;ume to e&s;timate the change which befel ADAM, on his expul&s;ion from Paradi&s;e, by the deformity that took place on the face of the world, we &s;hould be apt to believe the exile, though not di&s;torted in body, was yet darkened in under&s;tanding&mdash;in&s;tead of confidence and &s;teady faith, that di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y would take place, and di&s;belief confound even te&s;timony; that argument would be deprived of definition, and wander by excentric propo&s;itions; that confu&s;ion would u&s;urp the throne of wi&s;dom, and folly of judgment; thorns and thi&s;tles grow up in the place of tho&s;e excellent
<PB N="6" REF="12">
flowers of &s;cience which flouri&s;hed in Eden, and darkne&s;s cloud the day of his capacity.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to determine, from any evidence given to us, in what degree di&s;obedience and &s;in immediately contracted the under&s;tanding of ADAM; but we are certain that great and dread|ful effects very early took place on Adam's po&s;terity.&mdash;We may conclude, memory was retained by our fir&s;t parent in all its energy&mdash;a terrible portion of the puni&s;h|ment his di&s;obedience had incurred; re|&s;toring to him perfect images, and never-dying e&s;timates, of what he had lo&s;t, and thereby increa&s;ing the bitterne&s;s of what he had purcha&s;ed. Through the endow|ments of memory, ADAM would nece&s;|&s;arily teach to his family the &s;ciences which he had comprehended in Eden, and the knowledge he had gained of NATURE and her GOD.&mdash;It will fol|low, that &s;ome of them would retain tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom, and faithfully tran&s;mit them to po&s;terity.&mdash;No doubt the family of Cain (who bore the &s;eal
<PB N="7" REF="13">
of the cur&s;e on his forehead) was given up to ignorance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>Gene&s;is, cha. iv. ver. 16.</BIBL>&mdash;And Cain went out from the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Tradition would deliver down the doc|trines of our fir&s;t parents with the utmo&s;t truth and certainty, whil&s;t the Antidelu|vians enjoyed that longivity of which the books of Mo&s;es give evidence&mdash;but when men came to multiply exceedingly upon the face of the earth, and were di&s;per&s;ed to the di&s;tant regions of the globe, then the ine&s;timable le&s;&s;ons of KNOWLEDGE and TRUTH, taught by the fir&s;t men, fell into confu&s;ion and corruption, and were retained pure and in perfection but by few &mdash; tho&s;e few, to our great con&s;olation, have handed them down to after ages &mdash; they al&s;o retained the UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE, uncor|rupted, with the confu&s;ion of the plains of Shinar, and pre&s;erved it to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Thus we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look back to OUR FIRST PARENT, as the original Profe&s;&s;or of the WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD, to whom the Religion and
<PB N="8" REF="14">
my&s;teries of NATURE were fir&s;t reveal|ed, and from whom all the WISDOM of the world was in the beginning derived.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e times, when the pre&s;ent Rules and maxims of our profe&s;&s;ion of FREE MASONRY had their beginning, the minds of men were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Allego|ries, Emblems, and my&s;tic devices, in which, peculiar &s;ciences, manners, in&s;ti|tutions, and doctrines in many nations were wrapt up&mdash;this was an invention of the earlie&s;t ages &mdash; the prie&s;ts in Egypt &s;e|creted the my&s;teries of their religion from the vulgar, by &s;ymbols and hieroglyphics comprehen&s;ible alone to tho&s;e of their own order. The prie&s;ts of Rome and Greece practi&s;ed other &s;ubtleties by which the art of divination was enveiled, and their oracles were intelligible only to their brethren, who expounded them to the people.</P>
<P>The&s;e examples were WISELY adopted for the purpo&s;es of concealing the my&s;te|ries of MASONRY&mdash;like the Cybil's leaves, the &s;ecrets of the brotherhood would appear to the world as indi&s;tinct
<PB N="9" REF="15">
and &s;cattered fragments, whil&s;t they con|vey to MASONS an uniform and well-connected &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the forming of this &s;ociety, which is at once RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL, great regard has been given to the fir&s;t knowledge of the GOD OF NATURE, and that acceptable &s;ervice wherewith he is well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t &s;tage on which our originals thought it expedient to place the foundation of MASONRY:&mdash;they had experienced that from religion all civil ties and obligations were compacted, and that thence proceeded all the bonds which could unite mankind in &s;ocial in|tercour&s;e:&mdash;hence it was that they laid the corner &s;tone of the EDIFICE on the bo&s;om of religion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>Religions</HI> all! de&s;cending from the &s;kies</L>

<P><PB N="10" REF="16">In the earlie&s;t ages, after the deluge, in tho&s;e nations made known to us, the &s;ervice of the true God was clouded with imagery, and defiled by idolatry.&mdash;Men who had not been taught the doctrines of truth, by tho&s;e who retained the wi&s;|dom of the Antideluvians, but were left to the operations of their own judg|ments, perceived that there was &s;ome great cau&s;e of nature's uniformity, and wonderful progre&s;&s;ions of her works: &s;uitable to their ignorance, they repre|&s;ented the Author of tho&s;e works, by &s;uch objects as &s;truck their ob&s;ervation, for their powerful effects on the face of the world&mdash;from whence the SUN AND

<P><Q>The de&s;cendants of <HI>Chus,</HI> called <HI>Cuthites,</HI> were tho&s;e Emigrants who carried their rites, religions, and cu&s;toms into various quarters of the globe; &mdash; they were the fir&s;t apo&s;tates from the <HI>Truth,</HI> yet great in worldly wi&s;dom;&mdash;they were joined in their expeditions by other nations, e&s;pecially by the collateral branches of their family, the <HI>Mizraim, Caphtorim,</HI> and the &s;ons of <HI>Canaan;</HI>&mdash;the&s;e were all of the line of <HI>Ham,</HI> who was held by his po&s;teritie in the highe&s;t veneration;&mdash;they called him <HI>Amon,</HI> and hav|in proce&s;s of time rai&s;ed him to a Divinity, they wor&s;hipped him as the <HI>Sun,</HI> and from this wor|&s;hip they were &s;tiled <HI>Amonians.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The Deitie which they wor&s;hipped was the <HI>Sun,</HI> but they &s;oon conferred his titles upon &s;ome of their ance&s;tors; whence aro&s;e a mixed wor&s;hip.

<P><PB N="12" REF="18">MOSES was learned in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians; he was initiated in all the knowledge of the WISEMEN of that nation, by whom the learning of anti|quity had been retained and held &s;acred; wrapped up from the eye of the wicked and vulgar, in &s;ymbols and hieroglyphics, and communicated to men of their own order only, with care, &s;ecrecy, and cir|cum&s;pection.&mdash;This &s;ecrecy is not in any wi&s;e to be wondered at, when we con|&s;ider the per&s;ecution which would have followed a faith unacceptable to the igno|rance of the nations who were enveloped in &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry; and more particularly, as the&s;e &s;ages were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that valuable knowledge of the powers of nature, of the qualities of matter, and properties of things, &s;o dan|gerous to be communicated to wicked and ignorant men, from who&s;e malevo|lence the mo&s;t horrid offences might be derived: of which we may judge by the extraordinary and a&s;toni&s;hing perform|ances even of tho&s;e impious and un|enlightened men, who contended with

<P>MOSES dive&s;ted the wor&s;hip of the Deity of its cloak of my&s;teries and images, and taught the Jews the know|ledge of the God of the Univer&s;e, un|polluted with the errors of the nations of the earth, and uncorrupted with the devices and ludicrous ceremonies in&s;ti|tuted by the people of the Ea&s;t, from whom he derived his fir&s;t comprehen&s;ion and knowledge of the Divinity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Author of <Q>the Di&s;&s;ertation on the an|tient Pagan My&s;teries,</Q> defending Dr Warbur|ton's po&s;itions again&s;t Dr Leland, writes thus: <Q>that to the <HI>Pagan Divinity</HI> there was not only an open and public wor&s;hip, but al&s;o a &s;ecret wor&s;hip paid to them, to which none were ad|mitted but tho&s;e who had been &s;elected by pre|paratory ceremonies, called <HI>Initiation.</HI> This &s;ecret wor&s;hip was termed the <HI>My&s;teries.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Of the&s;e there were two &s;orts, the <HI>greater</HI> and the <HI>le&s;&s;er:</HI> according to the Bi&s;hop of Glou|ce&s;ter,
<PB N="14" REF="20">the le&s;&s;er taught, by certain &s;ecret rites and &s;hews, the <HI>Origin</HI> of <HI>Society,</HI> and the doc|trine of a <HI>future State;</HI> they were <HI>preparatory</HI> to the <HI>greater,</HI> and might be &s;afely communicated to all the <HI>initiated,</HI> without exception.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Arcana of the greater My&s;teries,</HI> were the doctrine of the <HI>Unity,</HI> and the detection of the errors of the vulgar <HI>Polythei&s;m;</HI> the&s;e were not communicated to all the a&s;pirants, without ex|ception, but only to a &s;mall and <HI>&s;elect number,</HI> who 
<PB N="15" REF="21">were judged capable of the <HI>&s;ecret.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The initiated were obliged by the mo&s;t <HI>&s;olemn engagements,</HI> to commence a life of &s;tricte&s;t piety and virtue; it was proper therefore to give them all the encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e. Now in the Pagan world there was a powerful temptation to vice and debauchery, the profligate examples of their Gods. Ego homuncio hoc non facerem, was the ab&s;olving formula, whenever any one was re&s;olved to give a loo&s;e to his pa&s;&s;ions. This evil the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> remedied, by &s;triking at the root of it; therefore &s;uch of the <HI>initiated</HI> as were judged capable, were made acquainted with the whole delu&s;ion. The <HI>My&s;tagogue</HI> taught them, that Jupiter, Mercury, Bacchus, Venus, Mars, and the whole rabble of licentious Dei|ties, were only dead mortals; &s;ubject, in life, to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities with them|&s;elves; but having been on other accounts benefactors to mankind, grateful po&s;teritie had deified them; and with their virtues, had in|di&s;creetly canonized their vices.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The fabulous <HI>Gods</HI> being thus rooted, the <HI>Supreme Cau&s;e of all things</HI> naturally took their place. Him they were taught to con&s;ider, as the <HI>Creator</HI> of the univer&s;e, who pervaded all things by his virtue, and governed all by his providence. But here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the di&s;covery of this <HI>Supreme Cau&s;e,</HI> was &s;o made, as to be con&s;i&s;tent with the notion of local tutelary deities, beings &s;uperior to men, and inferior to God, and by him &s;et over the &s;everal parts of his creation. This was an opinion univer&s;ally holden by antiquity, and 
<PB N="16" REF="22">never brought into que&s;tion by any Thei&s;t. What the <HI>Arcana</HI> of the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> overthrew, was the vulgar <HI>Polythei&s;m,</HI> the wor&s;hip of dead men.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It was natural for the&s;e politicians, to keep this a &s;ecret in the <HI>My&s;teries;</HI> for in their opi|nion, not only the extinction, but even the gra|dation of their fal&s;e gods, would have too much di&s;concerted and embroiled the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of vulgar <HI>Polythei&s;m.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From hence we may be led to determine, that to Mo&s;es the &s;ecret of the <HI>Egyptian Mythology</HI> was divulged by his preceptors, and the know|ledge of the <HI>only God</HI> revealed to him, dive&s;ted of all the <HI>&s;ymbols and devices</HI> which engaged the <HI>vulgar.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is no doubt that our cere|monies and my&s;teries were derived from the rites, ceremonies, and in&s;titu|tions of the antients, and &s;ome of them from the remote&s;t ages. Our morality is deduced from the maxims of the Grecian philo&s;ophers, and perfected by the chri&s;|tian revelation.</P>
<P>The in&s;titutors of this &s;ociety had their eyes on the progre&s;&s;ion of religion, and they &s;ymbolized it, as well in the fir&s;t &s;tage, as in the advancement of ma|&s;ons.&mdash;The knowledge of the God of
<PB N="24" REF="30">
Nature forms the fir&s;t e&s;tate of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion; the wor&s;hip of the Deity under the jewi&s;h law, is de&s;cribed in the &s;e|cond &s;tage of ma&s;onry; and the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation is di&s;tingui&s;hed in the la&s;t and highe&s;t order.</P>
<P>It is extremely difficult, with any de|gree of certainty, to trace the exact origin of our &s;ymbols, or from whence our ce|remonies or my&s;teries were particularly derived.&mdash;I &s;hall point out &s;ome antient in&s;titutions from whence they may have been deduced.</P>
<P>The ASSIDEANS (a &s;ect among the Jews, divided into <GAP DESC="foreign"> the merci|ful, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> the ju&s;t) the fathers and predece&s;&s;ors of the PHARISEES and ESSENES:&mdash;they preferred their tradi|tions before the written word, and &s;et up for a &s;anctity and purity that exceeded the law: they at la&s;t fell into the error of the Sadduces, in denying the re&s;ur|rection, and the faith of rewards and pu|ni&s;hments after this life.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31">The ESSENES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The etymologies of the names E&s;&s;aei or E&s;&s;eni, i. e. <HI>E&s;&s;enes,</HI> are divers; that which I prefer is from the Syriac <GAP DESC="foreign"> A&s;a, &s;igni|fying <GAP DESC="foreign">, to heal or cure di&s;ea&s;es; for though they gave them&s;elves chiefly to the &s;tudy of the Bible, yet with all they &s;tudied phy&s;ic.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Concerning the beginning of this &s;ect, from whom or when it began, it is hard to deter|mine. Some make them as antient as the Re|chabites, and the Rechabites to have differed only in the addition of &s;ome rules and ordi|nances from the Kenites, mentioned Judg. i. 16. and thus by con&s;equence the E&s;&s;enes were as antient as the I&s;raelites departure out of Egypt: for Jethro, Mo&s;es's father-in law, as appears by the text, was a Kenite: but neither of the&s;e &s;eemeth probable, for the Kenites are not men|tioned in &s;cripture, as a di&s;tinct order or &s;ect of people, but as a di&s;tinct family, kindred, or na|tion. Numb. xxiv. 2.&mdash;Secondly, the Rechabites did not build hou&s;es, but dwelt in tents; nei|ther did they deal in hu&s;bandry; they &s;owed no &s;eed, nor planted vine-yards, nor had any. Jer. lv. 7.&mdash;The <HI>E&s;&s;enes,</HI> on the contrary, dwelt not in tents, but in hou&s;es, and they employed them&s;elves e&s;pecially in hu&s;bandry. One of the
<PB N="26" REF="32">Hebrew doctors &s;aith, that the <HI>E&s;&s;enes</HI> were Na|zarites: but that cannot be, becau&s;e the law enjoined the Nazarites, when the time of the con&s;ecration was on, to pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the door of the tabernacle or temple. Numb. vi. Now the <HI>E&s;&s;enes</HI> had no acce&s;s to the temple; when, therefore, or from what author this &s;ect took its beginning is uncertain. The fir&s;t that I find mentioned by the name of an <HI>E&s;&s;ene</HI> Jo&s;ephus, l. xiii. c. 19.) was one Judas, who lived in the time of Ari&s;tobulus, the &s;on of Jannes Hyrcanus, before our Saviour's birth about one hundred years: however this &s;ect was of greater antiquity, for all three, phari&s;ees, Sadduces, and <HI>E&s;&s;enes,</HI> were in Jonathan's time, the brother of Judas Maccabeus, who was fifty years before Ari&s;tobulus. Certain it is, that this &s;ect continued until the days of our Saviour and after: Philo and Jo&s;ephus &s;peak of them as liv|ing in their times. What might be the rea&s;on then, that there is no mention of them in the New Te&s;tament? I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, the number of them &s;eemeth not to have been great in Philo and Jo&s;ephus's time, about four thou&s;and, which being di&s;per&s;ed in many cities, made the faction weak: and happily in Jeru&s;alem, when our Sa|viour lived, they were either few or none. Se|condly,
<PB N="27" REF="33">if we ob&s;erve hi&s;tories, we &s;hall find them peaceable and quiet, not oppo&s;ing any, and therefore not &s;o liable to reproof as the Phari&s;ees and Sadduces, who oppo&s;ed each other, and both joined again&s;t Chri&s;t. Thirdly, why might they not as well be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence in the New Te&s;tament (e&s;pecially con|taining them&s;elves quietly without contradiction of others) as the Rechabites in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, of whom there is mention only once, and that obliquely, although their order continued about three hundred years before this te&s;timony was given of them by the prophet Jeremy; for between John (with whom Jonadab was coeta|nean) and Zedekia, chronologers ob&s;erve the di&s;tance of many years. La&s;tly, though the name of <HI>E&s;&s;enes</HI> be not found in &s;cripture, yet we &s;hall find in St Paul's Epi&s;tles many things reproved, which were taught in the &s;chool of the <HI>E&s;&s;enes:</HI> of this nature was that advice given to Timothy, 1 Tim. v. 13. Drink no longer water, but u&s;e a little wine.&mdash;Again, 1 Tim. iv. 3. Forbidding to marry, and com|manding to ab&s;tain from meat, is a doctrine of devils&mdash;but e&s;pecially Colo&s;&s;. 2d, in many pa&s;|&s;ages the apo&s;tle &s;eemeth directly to point at them: Let no man condemn you in meat and 
<PB N="28" REF="34">drink, v. 16.&mdash;Let no man bear rule over you, by humblene&s;s of mind, and wor&s;hipping of angels, v. 18.&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">, why are ye &s;ub|ject to ordinances, v. 20.&mdash;The apo&s;tle u&s;eth the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which was applied by the <HI>E&s;&s;enes</HI> to denote their <HI>ordinances, aphori&s;ms, or con&s;titutions.</HI>&mdash;In the ver&s;e following he gives an in&s;tance of &s;ome particulars, Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not, ver. 21.&mdash;Now the junior company of <HI>E&s;&s;enes</HI> might not touch their &s;e|niors: and in their diet, their ta&s;te was limited to bread, &s;alt, water, and hy&s;&s;op: and the&s;e ordinances they undertook, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;aith Philo, for the love of <HI>wi&s;dom:</HI> but the apo&s;tle concludeth, ver. 23. that the&s;e things had only <GAP DESC="foreign"> a &s;hew of wi&s;dom. And whereas Philo termeth the religion of the <HI>E&s;&s;enes</HI> by the name of <GAP DESC="foreign">, which word &s;ignifieth religious wor&s;hip, the apo&s;tle termeth in the &s;ame ver&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign">, voluntary religion, or will wor&s;hip: yea, where he termeth their doctrine <GAP DESC="foreign">, a kind of philo&s;ophy received from their forefathers by tradition, St Paul biddeth them beware of philo&s;ophy, ver. 8. <BIBL>Godwyn's Mo&s;es and Aaron.</BIBL></Q></P>
<PB N="25" REF="31"></NOTE> were of very remote antiquity, and it hath been argued by divines, that they were as antient as the
<PB N="26" REF="32">
departure of the ISRAELITES out of EGYPT. They might take their ri&s;e, from that di&s;per&s;ion of their nation, which
<PB N="27" REF="33">
happened after their being carried captive into Babylon. The principal character of this &s;ect was, that they cho&s;e retire|ment,
<PB N="28" REF="34">
were &s;ober, were indu&s;trious; had all things in common; paid the highe&s;t regard to the moral precepts of the law, but neglected the ceremonial, any further
<PB N="29" REF="35">
than what regarded bodily cleanline&s;s, the ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath, and ma|king an annual pre&s;ent to THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM. They never a&s;&s;o|ciated with women, nor admitted them into their retreats. By the mo&s;t SACRED OATHS, though they were in general aver&s;e to &s;wearing, or to requiring an oath, they bound all whom they INI|TIATED among them, to the ob&s;ervance of piety, ju&s;tice, fidelity, and mode&s;ty; to conceal the &s;ecrets of the fraternity, pre&s;erve the books of their in&s;tructors, and with great care commemorate the names of the angels. They held, that GOD was &s;urrounded by &s;piritual beings, who were MEDIATORS with him, and and therefore to be reverenced. Second, that the &s;oul is defiled by the body, and that all bodily plea&s;ures hurt the &s;oul, which they believed to be immortal, though they denied the re&s;urrection of the body, as it would return the &s;oul to &s;in. Third, that there was a great MYSTERY in numbers, particularly in the number SEVEN; they therefore at|tributed a natural holine&s;s to the &s;eventh or SABBATH DAY, which they ob|&s;erved
<PB N="30" REF="36">
more &s;trictly than the other Jews. They &s;pent their time mo&s;tly in contem|plation, and ab&s;tained from every gratifi|cation of the &s;en&s;es. The ESSENES in|troduced their maxims into the CHRIS|TIAN CHURCH; and it is alledged by the learned, that St PAUL, in his epi&s;tles to the Ephe&s;ians and Colo&s;&s;ians, particu|larly cen&s;ures the tenets of this &s;ect.</P>
<Q>Of the&s;e ESSENES there were two &s;orts; &s;ome were THEORICKS, giv|ing them&s;elves wholly to &s;peculation; others PRACTICKS, laborious and painful in the daily exerci&s;e of tho&s;e arts or manufactories in which they were mo&s;t &s;kilful. Of the latter, Philo treateth in his book, intituled, Quod omnis vir probus: of the former, in the book following, intituled, De vita contemplativa.&mdash;<BIBL>Godwyn's Mo&s;es and Aaron.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The ESSENES were denied acce&s;s to the TEMPLE.</P>
<P>The PRACTICKS and THEORICKS both agreed in their aphori&s;ms or ordi|nances;
<PB N="31" REF="37">
but in certain circum&s;tances they differed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The PRACTICKS dwelt in the cities; the THEORICKS &s;hunned the cities, and dwelt in gardens and &s;olitary villages.</P>
<P N="2">2. The PRACTICKS &s;pent the day in manuel crafts, keeping of &s;heep, looking to bees, tilling of ground, &amp;c. they were artificers. The THEORICKS &s;pent the day in meditation and prayer; whence they were, from a kind of excellency, by Philo, termed &s;upplicants.</P>
<P N="3">3. The PRACTICKS had every day their dinner and &s;upper allowed them; the THEORICKS only their &s;upper.</P>
<P>The PRACTICKS had for their com|mons, every one his di&s;h of water-gruel and bread; the THEORICKS only bread and &s;alt: if any were of a more delicate palate than other, to him it was permitted to eat hy&s;&s;op; their drink for both was common water.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38">Some are of opinion that the&s;e THEO|RICKS were CHRISTIAN MONKS; but the contrary appeareth for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the whole book of Philo, con|cerning the Theoricks, there is no men|tion either of Chri&s;t or Chri&s;tians, of the Evangeli&s;ts or Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="2">2. The THEORICKS, in that book of Philo's, are not any new &s;ect of late be|ginning, as the chri&s;tians at that time were, as is clearly evinced by Philo's own words, in calling the doctrine of the ESSENES <GAP DESC="foreign">, a philo&s;ophy derived unto them by tradition from their forefathers.</P>
<P>In Grecian antiquity, we find a fe&s;tival celebrated in honour of CAERES,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>It was the mo&s;t celebrated and my&s;terious &s;olemnity of any in Greece; whence it is often called, by way of eminence, the <HI>My&s;teries;</HI> and &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly careful were they to conceal the <HI>&s;acred rites,</HI> that if any per&s;on divulged any of them, he was thought to have called down
<PB N="33" REF="39">&s;ome divine judgment upon his head, and it was accounted un&s;afe to abide in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him; wherefore he was apprehended as a public offender, and &s;uffered death. Such al&s;o was the &s;ecrecy of the&s;e <HI>rites,</HI> that if any per|&s;on, who was not lawfully initiated, did but out of ignorance or mi&s;take, chance to be pre|&s;ent at the my&s;terious rites, he was put to death. The neglect of initiation was looked upon as a crime of a very heinous nature; in&s;omuch that it was one part of the accu&s;ation for which <HI>Socrates</HI> was condemned to death. Per&s;ons convicted of witchcraft, or any other heinous crime, or had committed murder, though in|voluntary, were debarred from the&s;e my&s;teries. In later times certain in&s;titutions were made, called the le&s;&s;er my&s;teries, and were u&s;ed as preparative to the greater; for no per&s;ons were initiated in the greater, unle&s;s they had purified
<PB N="34" REF="40">at the le&s;&s;er. The per&s;ons who were to be ad|mitted to the greater my&s;teries, made their &s;a|crifice a year after purification, the &s;ecret rites of which (&s;ome few excepted to which only prie&s;ts were con&s;cious) were frankly revealed to them.&mdash;The manner of <HI>initiation</HI> was thus: the candidates being crowned with myrtle, had ad|mittance by night into a place called <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>my&s;tical temple,</HI> which was an edifice &s;o va&s;t and capacious, that the mo&s;t am|ple theatre did &s;carce exceed it. At their en|trance they purified them&s;elves by wa&s;hing their hands in holy water, and at the &s;ame time were admoni&s;hed to pre&s;ent them&s;elves with minds pure and undefiled, without which the external cleanne&s;s of the body would by no means be accepted. After this the <HI>holy my&s;teries</HI> were read to them out of a book called <GAP DESC="foreign">, which word is derived from <GAP DESC="foreign"> a &s;tone; be|cau&s;e the book was nothing el&s;e but two &s;tones fitly cemented together.

<P>IT is with plea&s;ure I pur&s;ue the duty I have impo&s;ed upon my&s;elf, to give &s;olutions of the MYSTERIES in MA|SONRY; which to minds inattentive to the real import of the objects in their view, might remain undi&s;covered; and the pro|fe&s;&s;or of ma&s;onry might pa&s;s on, without receiving a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e dignities which he hath a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>I have defined what is intended to be repre&s;ented by a LODGE, and its origin and nature; it is now my duty to di&s;co|ver to you the import of the FURNI|TURE OF A LODGE.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117">As SOLOMON at JERUSALEM car|ried into the Jewi&s;h temple all the ve&s;&s;els and in&s;truments requi&s;ite for the &s;ervice of JEHOVAH, according to the law of his people; &s;o we MASONS, as workers in moral duties, and as &s;ervants of the GREAT ARCHITECT of the world, have placed in our view, tho&s;e emblems which &s;hould con&s;tantly remind us of what we are, and what is required of us.</P>
<P>The third emanation of ABRAX, in the Gno&s;tic hierarchy, was PHRONAE|SIS, the emblem of PRUDENCE, which is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t exalted object that de|mands our attention, in the lodge: &mdash; it is placed in the centre, ever to be pre&s;ent to the eye of the ma&s;on, that his heart may be attentive to her dictates, and &s;tedfa&s;t in her laws; &mdash; for PRUDENCE is the rule of all VIRTUES; &mdash; pru|dence is the path which leads to every degree of propriety; &mdash; prudence is the channel where &s;elf-approbation &s;lows for ever; &mdash;&s;he leads us forth to worthy ac|tions, and as a BLAZING STAR, en|lightneth
<PB N="112" REF="118">
us through the dreary and dark&s;ome paths of this life.</P>
<P>VIRTUE by morali&s;ts is defined to be <Q>that &s;tedfa&s;t purpo&s;e and firm will of doing tho&s;e things which nature hath dictated to us, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;a|lutary;&mdash;a habit of the &s;oul by which mankind are inclined to do the things which are upright and good, and to avoid tho&s;e that are evil</Q>&mdash;In &s;hort, virtue is moral hone&s;ty and good prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Of the VIRTUES of which PRU|DENCE is the rule, three are called Car|dinal Virtues, of which, mo&s;t properly, a Ma&s;on &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &mdash; FORTI|TUDE, TEMPERANCE and JUSTICE; for without the&s;e, the name of MASON is an empty title, and but a painted bubble.</P>
<P>That FORTITUDE mu&s;t be the cha|racteri&s;tic of a ma&s;on, I need not argue; by which, in the mid&s;t of pre&s;&s;ing evils, he is enabled always to do that which
<PB N="113" REF="119">
is agreeable to the dictates of right rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>TEMPERANCE al&s;o mu&s;t be one of his principles, being a moderating or re|&s;training of our affections and pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially in SOBRIETY AND CHAS|TITY.&mdash;We regard TEMPERANCE, under the various definitions of morali&s;ts, as con&s;tituting hone&s;ty, decency, and ba&s;h|fulne&s;s; and in its potential parts, in&s;ti|tuting meekne&s;s, clemency, and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>We profe&s;s JUSTICE as dictating to us to do right to all, and to yield to every man what belongeth to him.</P>
<P>The CARDINAL VIRTUES, Pru|dence, Fortitude, Temperance, and Ju&s;|tice, hold in their train the inferior powers of Peace, Concord, Quietne&s;s, Liberty, Safety, Honor, Felicity, Piety, and Cha|rity, with many others which were a|dored by the antients in tho&s;e ages, when they confounded mythology with the wor&s;hip of the Divinity.&mdash;Within the &s;tarry girdle of PRUDENCE all the vir|tues are enfolded.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="120">We may apply this EMBLEM to a &s;till more religious import;&mdash;it may be &s;aid to repre&s;ent the STAR which led the wi&s;e men to BETHLEHEM, pro|claiming to mankind the nativity of THE SON OF GOD, and here conduct|ing our &s;piritual progre&s;s to the author of REDEMPTION.</P>
<P>As the &s;teps of man are trod in the va|rious and uncertain incidents of life; as our days are chequered with a &s;trange contrariety of events, and our pa&s;&s;age through this exi&s;tence, though &s;ometimes attended with pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, is often be&s;et by a multitude of evils; hence is the LODGE furni&s;hed with MOSAIC WORK, to remind us of the precariou&s;ne&s;s of our &s;tate on earth; &mdash; to-day our feet tread in pro&s;perity, to|morrow we totter on the uneven paths of WEAKNESS, TEMPTATION, and ADVERSITY.&mdash;Whil&s;t this emblem is before us, we are in&s;tructed to boa&s;t of nothing;&mdash;to have compa&s;&s;ion and give aid to tho&s;e who are in adver&s;ity; &mdash; to walk uprightly, and with humility;&mdash;for

&s;uch is this exi&s;tence, that there is no &s;tation in which pride can be &s;tably founded:&mdash;all men in birth and in the grave are on the level.&mdash;Whil&s;t we tread on this MOSAIC WORK, let our ideas return to the original which it copies; and let every ma&s;on act as the dictates of rea&s;on prompt him, TO LIVE IN BRO|THERLY LOVE.</P>
<P>As more immediate guides for a FREE MASON, the lodge is furni&s;hed with un|erring rules, whereby he &s;hall form his conduct;&mdash;THE BOOK of his law is laid before him, that he may not &s;ay through ignorance he erred;&mdash;whatever the great ARCHITECT of the world hath dictated to mankind, as the mode in which he would be &s;erved, and the path in which he is to tread to obtain his approbation; &mdash;whatever precepts he hath admini&s;tred, and with whatever laws he hath in&s;pired the &s;ages of old, the &s;ame are faithfully comprized in THE BOOK OF THE LAW of MASONRY. That book, which is never clo&s;ed in any lodge, reveals the duties which the great MASTER of all exacts from us; &mdash; open to every eye,
<PB N="116" REF="122">
comprehen&s;ible to every mind; then who &s;hall &s;ay among us, that he knoweth not the acceptable &s;ervice?</P>
<P>But as the frailty of human nature wageth war with truth, and man's infir|mities &s;truggle with his virtues; to aid the conduct of every ma&s;on, the ma&s;ter holdeth the COMPASS, limiting the di&s;|tance, progre&s;s, and circumference of the work: he dictateth the manners, he giveth the direction of the de&s;ign, and delineateth each portion and part of the labour; a&s;&s;igning to each his province and his order. And &s;uch is his ma&s;ter|&s;hip, that each part, when a&s;under, &s;eem|eth irregular and without form; yet when put together, like the building of the TEMPLE at JERUSALEM, is connected and framed in true &s;ymmetry, beauty, and order.</P>
<P>The moral implication of which is, that the MASTER in his lodge fits dictating tho&s;e &s;alutary laws, for the regulation thereof, as his prudence directs; a&s;&s;igning to each brother his proper province; limiting the ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome, and cir|cum&s;cribing
<PB N="117" REF="123">
the imprudence of others; re&s;training all licentiou&s;ne&s;s and drunken|ne&s;s, di&s;cord and malice, envy and re|proach: and promoting brotherly love, morality, charity, benevolence, cordiality, and innocent mirth; that the a&s;&s;embly of the brethren may be with order, har|mony, and love.</P>
<P>To try the works of every ma&s;on, the SQUARE is pre&s;ented, as the probation of his life,&mdash;proving, whether his manners are regular and uniform; &mdash; for ma&s;ons &s;hould be of one principle and one rank, without the di&s;tinctions of pride and pageantry: intimating, that from high to low, the minds of ma&s;ons &s;hould be inclined to good works, above which no man &s;tands exalted by his fortune.</P>

Other nations (who had expre&s;&s;ed the at|tributes of the Deity by outward objects, or who had introduced pictures into the &s;acred places, as ornaments, or rather to a&s;&s;i&s;t the memory, claim devout attention, and warm the affections) ran into the &s;ame error, and idols multiplied upon the face of the earth.</P>

yet without que&s;tion they were the pro|jectors and &s;uperintendants of &s;uch works in every age and nation.</P>
<P>Without &s;uch regulations as Solomon had devi&s;ed for the government of his &s;ervants, without &s;uch artificers, and a &s;uperior wi&s;dom over-ruling the whole, we &s;hould be at a lo&s;s to account for the beginning, carrying on, and fini&s;hing that great work in the &s;pace of &s;even years and &s;ix months, when the two &s;ucceeding temples, though much infe|rior, employed &s;o much more time; and when we have good authority to believe that the temple of Diana at Ephe&s;us, a &s;tructure not comparable to the temple at Jeru&s;alem, was two hundred and twenty years in building.</P>
<P>The building being conducted by a &s;et of Religious, makes it natural to conceive, that from devotion and pious fervor, as well as emulation, tho&s;e employed had uncea&s;ing motives to prompt their dili|gence, and pre&s;erve harmony and order; as their labour was probationary, and led to an advancement to &s;uperior privileges

<P>SOLOMON him&s;elf was an extraordi|nary per&s;onage, and his wi&s;dom and mag|nificence had gained him the wonder and attention of the neighbouring nations;&mdash; but this &s;plendid &s;tructure, the wonder of the earth, thus rai&s;ed by the pious hands of men labouring in the wor&s;hip and &s;er|vice of the God of I&s;rael, would of con|&s;equence extend his fame, and attract the admiration of the more di&s;tant parts of the world:&mdash;his name and his artificers would become the wonder of mankind, and his works their example and emula|tion: &mdash; from thence the MASONS of SOLOMON would be di&s;per&s;ed into dif|ferent &s;tates, to &s;uperintend the works of other princes, and there would convert in&s;idels, initiate brethren in their my&s;te|ries, and extend their order over the di&s;|tant quarters of the known world.</P>
<P>We find that the like di&s;tinction was retained on rebuilding the temple in the reign of Cyrus, and that the work was
<PB N="143" REF="150">
performed by the religious of the I&s;|raelites, and not by ordinary mechanics; for they refu&s;ed to admit the Samaritans to a &s;hare of the work, although they petitioned it, under the denomination of &s;ervants of the &s;ame God:&mdash;but they were rejected, as unworthy of the works of piety, and unacceptable to the God of I&s;rael: for though they profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to be &s;ervants of the true God, they polluted their wor&s;hip by idols.</P>

<P>IT is now incumbent upon me to de|mon&s;trate to you the great &s;ignification of the letter G, wherewith lodges and the medals of ma&s;ons are ornamented.</P>
<P>To apply its &s;ignification to the name of GOD only, is depriving it of part of its MASONIC import; although I have already &s;hewn that the &s;ymbols u&s;ed in lodges are expre&s;&s;ive of the Divinity's be|ing the great object of Ma&s;onry, as archi|tect of the world.</P>
<P>This &s;ignificant letter denotes GEO|METRY, which to artificers, is the &s;ci|ence
<PB N="149" REF="156">
by which all their labours are calcu|lated and formed; and to Ma&s;ons, con|tains the determination, definition, and proof of the order, beauty, and wonder|ful wi&s;dom of the power of God in his creation.</P>
<P>GEOMETRY is &s;aid originally to have &s;ignified nothing more than the art of mea&s;uring the earth, or any di&s;tances or dimen&s;ions within it: but at pre&s;ent, it denotes the &s;cience of magnitude in general, comprehending the doctrine and relations of what&s;oever is &s;u&s;ceptible of augmentation or diminution. So to geometry, may be referred the con&s;truc|tion not only of lines, &s;uperficies, and &s;olids; but al&s;o of time, velocity, num|bers, weight, and many other matters.</P>
<P>This is a &s;cience which is &s;aid to have its ri&s;e, or at lea&s;t its pre&s;ent rules from the Egyptians, who, by nature, were un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing it, to remedy the confu&s;ion which generally happened in their lands, by the overflowing of the Nile, which carried away yearly all
<PB N="150" REF="157">
boundaries, and effaced all limits of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Thus this &s;cience which con|&s;i&s;ted only in its fir&s;t &s;teps of the means of mea&s;uring lands, that every per&s;on might have his property re&s;tored to him, was called geometry, or the art of mea&s;uring land: and it is probable, that the draughts and &s;chemes the Egyptians were annually compelled to make, helped them to di&s;|cover many excellent properties of tho&s;e figures, and which &s;peculation continu|ally occa&s;ioned to be improved.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LECTURE XII.</HI> On <HI>Brotherly Love.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Shall treat of BROTHERLY LOVE, in this lecture, in that light which &s;olely appertains to ma&s;ons.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity there is for the exertion of brotherly regard among ma&s;ons in the lodge, is obvious to every one:&mdash; PEACE, REGULARITY, and DECORUM are indi&s;pen&s;ible duties here:&mdash;all the &s;ire of re&s;entment, and remembrance of in|juries, &s;hould be forgotten; and that cordiality ought to be warm among us, which brings with it chearfulne&s;s and re|joicing:&mdash;the true wor&s;hipers of the Deity, men who held ju&s;t notions of the princi|ples of nature, in the times of barbarous
<PB N="203" REF="210">
ignorance, dur&s;t not publicly practi&s;e the one, or promulgate the other:&mdash;but happy is our e&s;tate, in this lettered age and this land of liberty, we profe&s;s our &s;entiments with freedom, and without fear; we exer|ci&s;e our religious principles under a full toleration; and as &s;ocial beings we a&s;&s;emble in the lodge, to enjoy the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip, and the breathings of true benevolence without alloy.</P>
<P>After the bu&s;ine&s;s of the lodge is di&s;|patched, we are met together to open out the chearfulne&s;s of our hearts with|out guile; for here are no tale-bearers, cen&s;ors, or revilers among us;&mdash;our lodge is &s;acred to SILENCE:&mdash;hence we may &s;ay figuratively, <Q>it is &s;ituate in the &s;e|cret places, where the cock holdeth not his watch, where the voice of rail|ing reacheth not, where brawling, as the intemperate wrath of women, can|not be heard.</Q></P>
<P>Without &s;u&s;picion of being betrayed in our words, or en&s;nared in the openne&s;s of our dealings, our mirth here is un|di&s;gui&s;ed, is governed by PRUDENCE,
<PB N="204" REF="211">
tempered with LOVE, and cloathed in CHARITY:&mdash;thus it &s;tandeth void of offence:&mdash;no malicious mind warps inno|cent expre&s;&s;ions to wicked con&s;tructions, or interprets unmeaning je&s;ts into &s;ar|ca&s;ms or &s;atyres; but as every &s;entiment flows full of benevolence, &s;o every ear here, is attuned to the &s;train, in harmo|nious concord, and ta&s;tes the plea&s;ures of fe&s;tivity &s;o pure, that they bear our re|flections, in the morning, without remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Peace, regularity, and decorum, which I &s;aid were indi&s;pen&s;ible duties here, are not the offspring of controul, or the i&s;&s;ue of authority; but a voluntary &s;ervice, which every man brings to the lodge.</P>
<P>There are &s;ea&s;ons indeed, in which authority is properly exerci&s;ed;&mdash;man is frail;&mdash;the mo&s;t prudent may &s;ometimes deviate:&mdash;it was a maxim of the antient philo&s;ophers, that "to err was human;" therefore in the lodge there ought to be a con&s;tant governor, who &s;hould re&s;train the improprieties which may creep in among us, by any brother coming here after an intemperance in liquor.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="212">Another degree of brotherly love which &s;hould prevail here, is to hear the peti|tions of every member of this &s;ociety with tenderne&s;s and attention.&mdash;Where there is at any time a brother of our commu|nity &s;ick or in di&s;tre&s;s, the ca&s;e of his ca|lamities &s;hould come here repre&s;ented by a brother, who will neither deceive us, nor hold back any part of his merits;&mdash; and the lodge mu&s;t te&s;tify all due regard, by receiving the petition patiently, and giving relief according to the de&s;erts.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t material part of that bro|therly love which &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t among us ma&s;ons, is that of &s;peaking well of each other to the world:&mdash;more e&s;pecially it is expected of every member of this fraternity, that he &s;hould not traduce his brother.&mdash;Calumny and &s;lander are dete&s;table crimes again&s;t &s;ociety.&mdash;No|thing can be viler than to traduce a man behind his back; it is like the villainy of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who has not virtue enough to give his adver&s;ary the means of &s;elf-defence; but lurking in darkne&s;s, &s;tabs

him whil&s;t he is unarmed, and un&s;u&s;pi|cious of an enemy.</P>
<P>Of this crime, the much-admired poet Shake&s;pear has given a ju&s;t de&s;cription.</P>
<Q><L>"The man who &s;teals my pur&s;e, &s;teals tra&s;h;</L>

<L>"But he who pilfers from me my good name,</L>
<L>"Robs me of that which not enriches him,</L>
<L>"But makes me poor indeed."</L></Q>
<P>Calumny has this direful con&s;equence, that it carries with it not a momentary effect only, but endures for time un|counted.&mdash;The wickedne&s;s of the world is &s;uch, that it is greedy of &s;candal; and when once the voice of defamation hath uttered its poi&s;on, like a pe&s;tilence it &s;mites and contaminates;&mdash;it &s;preads jea|lou&s;ies in families, divi&s;ion and wrath among friends, urges fathers again&s;t chil|dren, and brother again&s;t brother.&mdash;When once the pernicious tale gets birth, it cannot be recalled; and thence the &s;in|ner's penitence is not capable of expia|tion: for the evil con&s;equences may lay dormant in the womb of futurity, and become an intail of &s;orrow on the third and fourth generation of him that is in|jured.
<PB N="207" REF="214">
&mdash;What malice and mi&s;chief, what infernal di&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t actuate the mind which is capable of defaming the inno|cent!&mdash;there is no crime of which &s;uch a wretch might not be the perpetrator;&mdash; again&s;t &s;uch a villain there is no armour for defence;&mdash;he a&s;&s;aults the naked and un&s;u&s;picious, and like the contagion of &s;ome horrid di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;miteth whil&s;t the victim &s;leeps.&mdash;Ju&s;tice is di&s;armed again&s;t &s;uch a &s;inner, as concealment is his &s;afe|guard, and only the eye of heaven di&s;co|vers his iniquity.</P>
<P>It is not only expected of ma&s;ons, that they &s;hould, with a con&s;cientious &s;oul, re-refrain from evil-&s;peaking; but al&s;o, that they &s;hould &s;peak well of each other.</P>
<P>To give a man his ju&s;t and due cha|racter, is &s;o ea&s;y a duty, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for a benevolent mind to avoid it; &mdash;it is a degree of common ju&s;tice which hone&s;ty it&s;elf prompts one to.&mdash;It is not enough that we refrain from &s;lander; but it is required of ma&s;ons that they &s;hould &s;peak graciou&s;ly and with affection, with|holding nothing that can be uttered to a

brother's prai&s;e or good name with truth. &mdash;What a plea&s;ure doth it give the heart, feeling benevolent di&s;po&s;itions, to give prai&s;es where due.&mdash;There is a &s;elfi&s;h joy in good &s;peaking, as &s;elf-approbation &s;uc|ceeds it.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the brea&s;t of &s;uch a man feels enlarged, whil&s;t he utters the prai&s;e due to his neighbour; and he ex|periences all the fine&s;t &s;en&s;ations of love, whil&s;t he moves others to the &s;ame object of his regard.</P>
<P>The neutral di&s;po&s;ition, frigid and re|&s;erved, neither &s;peaks good nor evil;&mdash; but the man ta&s;ting brotherly love, is warm to commend.&mdash;It is an ea&s;y and cheap means of be&s;towing good gifts and working good works;&mdash;for by a ju&s;t prai&s;e to indu&s;try, you recommend the indu&s;trious man to tho&s;e to whom he might never be known, and thereby en|large his credit and his trade.&mdash;By a ju&s;t commendation of merit, you may open the paths of advancement through tho&s;e who&s;e power might never have been peti|tioned.&mdash;By a proper prai&s;e of genius and art, you may rou&s;e the attention of tho&s;e patrons to whom the greate&s;t de&s;ervings
<PB N="209" REF="216">
might have remained a &s;ecret. It is a degree of ju&s;tice which every man has a right to, from his brother, that his vir|tues be not concealed.</P>
<P>To &s;hroud the imperfections of our friend, and cloak his infirmities, is chri&s;|tian-like, and charitable, con&s;equently be|&s;itting a ma&s;on:&mdash;even the truth &s;hould not be told at all times; for where we cannot approve, we &s;hould pity in &s;ilence. &mdash;What plea&s;ure or profit can there ari&s;e by expo&s;ing the &s;ecrets of a brother?&mdash; To exhort him, is virtuous;&mdash;to revile him, is inhuman; &mdash;and to &s;et him out as an object of ridicule, is infernal.</P>
<P>From hence we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily deter|mine, that the duty of a good man leads to work the works of benevolence; and his heart is touched with joy, whil&s;t he acts within her precepts.</P>
<P>Let us therefore be &s;tedfa&s;t and im|moveable in our ordinances, that we be proved to have A TONGUE OF GOOD REPORT.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LECTURE XIII.</HI> On the <HI>Occupations</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;ons.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN my former lectures I have declared it to be my opinion, that MASONS, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of MASONRY, were never a body of architects.&mdash;By the book of con&s;titutions publi&s;hed by authority, we &s;ee no grand communication held in form, till of very late date: neither is there any evidence therein to contradict the propo&s;itions I have laid down.&mdash;The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion therein de&s;cribed, is by no means to be accepted and under&s;tood in a literal &s;en&s;e; but as a pedigree or chrono|logical table of the &s;ervants of the Deity, working in the duties of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="218">I ground my judgment of the nature of our profe&s;&s;ion on our ceremonials, and am convinced they have not their rela|tion to building and architecture, but are emblematical, and imply moral, &s;pi|ritual, and religious tenets.&mdash;It appears to me &s;elf-evident, that the &s;ituation of the lodge, and its &s;everal parts, are copied after the tabernacle and temple, and are repre&s;entative of the univer&s;e, implying that the univer&s;e is the temple in which the Deity is every where pre&s;ent; our mode of teaching the principles of our profe&s;&s;ion, is derived from the Druids; our maxims of morality, from Pytha|goras; our chief emblems, originally from Egypt; to Ba&s;ilides we owe the &s;cience of Abrax, and the characters of tho&s;e emanations of the Deity which we have adopted, and which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of a moral &s;ociety.&mdash;I am induced to believe, that our pre&s;ent ceremonies were more generally taught, and more candidates were initiated there|in, on the opening of the cru&s;ades, than in any other aera, or on any other known occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="219">The Engli&s;h hi&s;torians agree, that in the reign of Henry the Second, and in the year 1188, at an interview between the Kings of England and France, at|tended by the prelates and nobility of both nations, the Archbi&s;hop of Tyre pronounced &s;uch a melancholy account of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ladine's &s;ucce&s;s in the Holy Land, and the mi&s;eries of the chri&s;tians in that country, that the audience was greatly affected with the relation; and the two kings agreed to convert their whole at|tention to the relief of tho&s;e adventurers. &mdash;They received the cro&s;s from the hands of the archbi&s;hop, re&s;olving to go there in per&s;on; and their example was fol|lowed by Philip Count of Flanders, and a great number of the prelates and nobi|lity there pre&s;ent:&mdash;A PLENARY IN|DULGENCE was publi&s;hed in the pope's name, for all that would make a fair confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and engage in the cru&s;ade: &mdash;the different nations a&s;&s;umed cro&s;&s;es of a different colour, and RULES AND ORDERS were e&s;tabli&s;hed for pre|venting RIOT, LUXURY, AND DIS|ORDER on the enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="220">The&s;e were the principal rules made for the regulation of the cru&s;aders.&mdash;We may conjecture the&s;e religious campaigns being over, that men initiated in the my&s;teries of ma&s;onry, and engaged and inrolled under tho&s;e rules and orders, which were e&s;tabli&s;hed for the conduct of the nations in the holy war, would form them&s;elves into lodges, and keep up their &s;ocial meetings when returned home, in commemoration of their adventures and mutual good offices in Pale&s;tine, and for the propagation of that knowledge into which they had been initiated.</P>
<P>As a further argument that builders and architects were not the original mem|bers of our &s;ociety, the MASONS of the city of London obtained their incorpora|tion and charter in the reign of King Henry the Fifth, in or about the year 1419; they taking on them&s;elves the name of FREE MASONS.&mdash;By their charter they are governed by a ma&s;ter and two wardens, with twenty-five a&s;|&s;i&s;tants.&mdash;Of this incorporated body, &s;ixty-five are of the livery of London.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221">It has never been pretended, that the &s;ociety of FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS have in any manner been con|nected, or much le&s;s have united them|&s;elves, with the incorporated body of ma|&s;ons enchartered; but on the contrary, have kept them&s;elves totally apart.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that in the reign of King Henry the Sixth an ob&s;olete law was enacted, &s;etting forth, <Q>that by the yearly congregations and confederacies made by ma&s;ons in their general a&s;&s;em|blies, the good cour&s;e and effects of the &s;tatute of labourers were openly vio|lated and broken, and making the fu|ture holding of their chapters and con|gregations felony.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that this &s;tatute &s;hould relate to any other per&s;ons, than the in|corporated body of working ma&s;ons; who under an exclu&s;ive charter, by &s;e|cret combinations rai&s;ed the prices of their labour, and prevented craft&s;men of their fraternity, not members of the charter, from exerci&s;ing their trade within the
<PB N="215" REF="222">
limits of London; which might occa&s;ion a grievance worthy of parliamentary re|dre&s;s:&mdash;but in what manner the &s;tatutes of labourers could be affected by the a&s;&s;o|ciations of this fraternity of ours, is not in my power to comprehend.

<P>By the charter of MASONS, they a&s;|&s;umed the title of FREE MASONS, be|ing intitled to the franchi&s;es of the city of London.</P>
<P>Why the title of FREE is annexed to our &s;ociety, or that of ACCEPTED, I hope I may be allowed to conjecture was derived from the cru&s;ades.&mdash;There the volunteers entering into that &s;ervice mu&s;t be FREEMEN, born free, and not vil|lains or under any va&s;&s;allage; for it was not until long after the cru&s;ades, that va&s;&s;allage and feudal &s;ervices, together with the &s;lavi&s;h tenures, were taken a|way.</P>

<P>In the Angla-Norman Antiquities, it is &s;aid of FREE MASONS, that they were an a&s;&s;ociation of religious, who en|gaged in the founding and erecting of churches and religious hou&s;es in Pale&s;tine. &mdash;I have already mentioned the religious &s;ect who were really architects and buil|ders of churches, the haly-wark-folk, with no &s;mall degree of re&s;pect: they were a body of men &s;ub&s;i&s;ting before the cru&s;ades:&mdash;they were maintained by the church, under which they held lands for the &s;ervice of erecting and repairing churches, and for the guarding of the &s;epulchres of &s;aints.&mdash;It is not improbable, that when the rage of holy works and holy wars and the de&s;ire of Pale&s;tine fired the minds of all Europe, but a body of tho&s;e people might embark in the enter|prize, and be tran&s;ported thither to build churches, for the better planting or pro|pagating the chri&s;tian doctrine, or to guard and maintain the holy &s;epulchre.&mdash; I would be ready at all times to admit

<P>Our ORIGIN in this country is thought to be from the PHOENICI|ANS who came here with the Tyrian Hercules, and introduced the doctrines of HAM and the AMONIAN rites, together with the HEBREW CUS|TOMS; and afterwards the emigrants from the Holy Land, who taught us the rules in&s;tituted by SOLOMON at the temple of Jeru&s;alem; and finally, the propagators of the chri&s;tian doctrine, who brought with them the principles of the

Yet I fear few among us are equal to the cha|racter we have a&s;&s;umed. Our LODGES are not now appropriated to WORSHIP and RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES; we meet as A SOCIAL SOCIETY, inclined to acts of benevolence, and &s;uffer the more &s;acred offices to re&s;t unperformed. &mdash;Whether this neglect is to our honor, I pre&s;ume not to remon&s;trate; in our PRESENT STATE profe&s;&s;ing our&s;elves FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS.

<P>It is well known to us, that there is &s;carce a &s;tate in Europe, in which our fraternity have not formed a body.&mdash;The wi&s;dom of the antients would pa&s;s abroad into many regions, and tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the pious labours at Jeru&s;alem, would, like Pythagoras, teach the &s;ciences and my&s;teries which they profe&s;&s;ed, and communicate the &s;y&s;tem to which they had been initiated;&mdash;religious men would retain the doctrines and my&s;teries with reverence, and with caution reveal them to tho&s;e they thought worthy to receive; hence the original knowledge would pa&s;s into many countries:&mdash;but there is no accounting for this univer&s;ality of the &s;o|ciety, upon the principles of architecture and operative ma&s;onry:&mdash;the rage of church-building had not contaminated all Europe as it did England; neither is there any probable means to be deduced from

On the contrary, our my&s;teries are totally ab&s;tracted from the rules of me|chanics:

<P>I Shall now conclude the&s;e Lectures, with collecting into one view, the propo&s;itions and maxims which have en|gaged my attention throughout the whole work; thereby to give a clear idea of the my&s;teries of ma&s;onry, the progre&s;&s;ion and &s;pirit of its in&s;titution, origin, and pre|&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>I may have &s;eemed prolix, and have filled my arguments or repre&s;entations with repetitions; but where that &s;eeming impropriety takes place, it was nece&s;&s;ary to urge a po&s;ition which contended with &s;ome accepted error, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or vulgar prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="234">From the antient rites and ceremonies which I have laid before you, it will be ea&s;y for you to trace the origins of our own, and to di&s;cover the foundations on which our &s;ociety was erected. It is evi|dent they had their progre&s;s in the po&s;t-deluvian world from Ham. I am under a nece&s;&s;ity &s;ometimes to u&s;e terms of art, or expre&s;&s;ions which to others may not carry di&s;tinct and clear images; but to my brethren, breathe an energy which flows from the united force of technical terms, &s;ymbols, and hieroglyphics. When I &s;peak of ma&s;ons under the denomina|tion of a &s;ociety, I mean ma&s;ons as embo|died in lodges, according to the pre&s;ent manners in which &s;uch lodges are held.&mdash; Our antiquity is in our principles, max|ims, language, learning, and religion:&mdash; the&s;e we derive from Eden, from the pa|triarchs, and from the &s;ages of the ea&s;t; all which are made perfect under the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. &mdash; The light and doctrines which we po&s;&s;e&s;s, are derived from the beginning of time, and have de&s;cended through this long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages uncorrupted; but our modes and manners are deduced from the different
<PB N="228" REF="235">
aeras of paradi&s;e, the building of the temple at Jeru&s;alem, and the chri&s;tian revelation.</P>
<P>I have explained to you, that the &s;truc|ture of the LODGE is a pattern of the univer&s;e, and that the fir&s;t entry of a ma&s;on repre&s;ents the fir&s;t wor&s;hip of the true God.&mdash;We have retained the Egyp|tian &s;ymbols of the SUN AND MOON, as the emblems of God's power, eter|nity, omnipre&s;ence, and benevolence; and thereby we &s;ignify, that we are the chil|dren of light, and that the fir&s;t founda|tion of our profe&s;&s;ion, is the knowledge and adoration of the Almighty, <GAP DESC="foreign">, who &s;eateth him&s;elf in the centre of the heavens:&mdash;we derive from the Druids many of the Amonian rites; and I am bold to &s;ay, that we retain more of the ceremonials and doctrines of the Druids, than is to be found in the whole world be&s;ides; and have &s;aved from oblivion, many of their religious rites, in our initia|tion to the fir&s;t degree of ma&s;onry, which otherwi&s;e would have &s;lept in eternity. The&s;e we &s;eem to have mixed and tem|pered with the principles of the E&s;&s;enes,
<PB N="229" REF="236">
who are a &s;ect as antient as the departure of the children of I&s;rael out of Egypt.&mdash; The philo&s;ophy of the Egyptians, and the manners, principles, and cu&s;toms of the Hebrews, were introduced to this land by the Phoenicians, and make a part of our profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as they are adapted to the wor&s;hip of NATURE'S GREAT AU|THOR, unpolluted by idolatry.</P>
<P>We hold our grand fe&s;tival on the day of ST JOHN, which is Mid&s;ummer-day; in which we celebrate that &s;ea&s;on when the &s;un is in its greate&s;t altitude, and in the mid&s;t of its proli&s;ic powers: the great type of the omnipotence of the Deity.</P>
<P>The famous lawyer, Lord Cook, in his Treati&s;e on Littleton's In&s;titutes, &s;ays, <Q>Prudent antiquity did, for more &s;olem|nity and better memory and ob&s;erva|tion of that which is to be done, ex|pre&s;s &s;ub&s;tances under ceremonies.</Q></P>
<P>I have pointed out to you, that the FURNITURES of the LODGE are em|blems excitive of morality and good go|vernment:&mdash;PRUDENCE &s;hines in the
<PB N="230" REF="237">
centre, or if you would apply this object to more &s;acred principles, it repre&s;ents the blazing &s;tar which conducted the wi&s;e men to Bethlehem, and proclaimed the pre&s;ence of the SON OF GOD. It is here placed in your view, that you may remember to work out the works of &s;alvation, which is at hand:&mdash;and that you may pa&s;s on in acts of &s;trict propriety with greater alacrity, the TASSALATA or MOSAIC-WORK intimates to you, the chequered diver&s;ity and uncertainty of human affairs; that you may not &s;et your hearts on the things of this world, but lay up your trea&s;ures where the ru&s;t cannot deface their poli&s;h and lu&s;tre, nei|ther can the moth de&s;poil the garment for the wedding fea&s;t.</P>
<P>To protect and &s;upport us under the infirmities of nature, and lead us to the paths of propriety, the BOOK OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE is in the lodge;&mdash;the MASTER circum&s;cribes you, as with the &s;weep of the COMPASS; and the SQUARE is your trial, whereby you &s;hall prove the rectitude and uniformity of your manners.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238">In my next Lecture I demon&s;trated to you, that to be a worthy &s;ervant in the temple of God, you mu&s;t be cloathed with INNOCENCE, that your &s;ervice may &s;tand in approbation, and you may be accepted in heaven.&mdash;Our jewels are emblems of that good working in a moral mind which adorns the life of man; FAITH, CHARITY, AND UPRIGHT|NESS.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding Lecture, I have led you to a di&s;cernment of the &s;econd race of the &s;ervants of God, under the MO|SAIC LAW; the truth being &s;tripped of the errors of idolatry.&mdash;This &s;tage is a|dapted to the &s;econd gradation of ma|&s;onry.</P>
<P>I have argued for the propriety of our adopting GEOMETRY in this &s;ociety, as being a &s;cience, from whence the mighty powers of God are revealed and demon|&s;trated to mankind.</P>
<P>Afterwards I attended to the e&s;tate of the wor&s;hippers of the Deity, under the
<PB N="232" REF="239">
corruptions of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and under the rottenne&s;s of the old law.&mdash;In this a&s;&s;embly of chri&s;tians, it is in no wi&s;e requi&s;ite to attempt an argument on the nece&s;&s;ity which there was upon earth for a Mediator and Saviour for man:&mdash;in the rubbi&s;h, &s;uper&s;titions, ceremonials, and filth of the Jewi&s;h temple, the true wor|&s;hip of God was buried and confounded, and INNOCENCE became only the or|naments of its monument.&mdash;Then it was that the Divinity, looking down with an eye of commi&s;eration on the deplorable &s;tate of man, in his mercy and love &s;ent us a Preceptor and Mediator, who &s;hould teach to us the doctrine of regeneration, and rai&s;e us from the &s;epulchre of &s;in, to which the human race had re&s;igned them|&s;elves:&mdash;he gave to us the precepts of that acceptable &s;ervice, wherewith his Father &s;hould be well plea&s;ed: he made the &s;acrifice of expiation, and becoming the fir&s;t-fruits of them that &s;lept, mani|fe&s;ted to mankind the re&s;urrection of the body and the life everla&s;ting.&mdash;In the MASTER'S ORDER this whole doctrine is &s;ymbolized, and the chri&s;tian conduct is by types pre&s;ented to us.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="240">We MASONS have adopted three par|ticular characteri&s;tics, SECRECY, CHA|RITY, AND BROTHERLY LOVE.&mdash; I have explained my &s;en&s;e of the&s;e three great duties, and of what e&s;pecial import they are of to MASONS; or to men who have &s;eparated them&s;elves from the re&s;t of mankind, and profe&s;&s;ed they are &s;er|vants of HIM WHO RULETH IN THE MIDST OF HEAVEN.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I have attempted to examine into the origin of our &s;ociety, and in many in&s;tances, wand'ring without evi|dence, I have been left to probability in conjecture only.&mdash;It doth not now &s;eem material to us what our originals and predece&s;&s;ors were, if we occupy our&s;elves in the true SPIRIT OF MASONRY; in that divine &s;pirit which in&s;pired the patriarchs when they erected altars unto the Lord; if we are true &s;ervants to our king, faithful and true to our chartered liberties, chri&s;tians in profe&s;&s;ion and in practice, and to each other, and mankind in general, affectionate and upright.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="241">Whether MASONS were originally builders or religious, it matters not to us in this age:&mdash;comparing the&s;e works with the righteou&s;ne&s;s to which I have exhorted you, the honor of the antiquity would be &s;wallowed up in the virtues of practice, and in the &s;plendor of that LIGHT OF ACCEPTATION, which at once proclaims to the world that we are &s;ervants of the true God, who &s;aves our &s;ouls alive.</P>
<P>If our ceremonies mean not the matter which I have expre&s;&s;ed; if they imply not the moral and religious principles which I have endeavoured to unveil; I a&s;k you, MASONS, what they do imply, import, or indicate?</P>
<P>Can we pre&s;ume &s;o many learned and noble per&s;onages would, for many &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive ages, have been &s;teady members of this fraternity, if the my&s;teries were unimportant, and the ceremonies unin|telligible?&mdash;It cannot be; &mdash; take away their SPIRIT, and they become ridi|culous.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242">Hath it been for ages a maxim of fooli&s;h &s;port, to induce men to a &s;illy &s;nare, in which the guide, having been entrapped into ridicule, longs to laugh at another for revenge?&mdash;It is too ridicu|lous to be pre&s;umed.&mdash;Be&s;ides, if it was only &s;o, the &s;nare might be formed and ornamented with &s;imple things, and there was no need to introduce &s;acred matters into the device.&mdash;This renders the con|jecture &s;o ab&s;urd, that it will bear no fur|ther animadver&s;ions.</P>
<P>We MASONS profe&s;s that we are pilgrims in progre&s;&s;ion from the EAST.</P>
<P>The Almighty planted a garden in the EAST, wherein he placed the perfection of human nature, the fir&s;t man, full of innocence and divine knowledge, and full of honor, even bearing the image of God.</P>
<P>Learning had its fir&s;t progre&s;&s;ion from the EAST after the flood: the Egyptians were the fir&s;t devi&s;ers of the zodiac, and the fir&s;t di&s;cerners of the wi&s;dom of the great ARCHITECT OF THE WORLD
<PB N="236" REF="243">
in the revolutions of the heavens: they were the fir&s;t projectors of the &s;cience of GEOMETRY.</P>
<P>In regard to the doctrine of our Sa|viour and the chri&s;tian revelation, it pro|ceeded from the EAST.</P>
<P>The &s;tar which proclaimed the birth of the Son of God, appeared in the EAST.</P>
<P>The EAST was an expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by the prophets to denote the Redeemer.</P>
<P>From thence it may well be conceived, that we &s;hould profe&s;s our progre&s;s to be from thence; if we profe&s;s by being MA|SONS, that we are a &s;ociety of the &s;er|vants of that Divinity, who&s;e abode is with the Father coeternal, in the centre of the heavens.</P>
<P>But if we profe&s;s no &s;uch matter, then why &s;hould not we have alledged our progre&s;s to have been from the north, and the regions of chaos and darkne&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244">But I will now, my brethren, forbear all further argument, and clo&s;e the la|bours of my year with a &s;incere exhorta|tion, that you will continue to act in this &s;ociety as upright and religious men;&mdash; that you will exert your&s;elves in the pro|motion of its honor;&mdash;and let the wicked and ignorant revile never &s;o maliciou&s;ly, be &s;trenuous in your duties, as MASONS and as BRETHREN:&mdash;exerci&s;e your be|nevolence with openne&s;s of heart, and your charity with cordiality, and not as hypocrites:&mdash;with attention endeavour to arrive at the utmo&s;t knowledge of your PROFESSION, the end of which, I pre|&s;ume to proclaim to you, is to work out THE WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="252">
<HEAD>NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS, ON THE FOREGOING QUESTIONS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. LOCKE.</BYLINE>
<P N="1">(1) JOHN LEYLANDE was appointed by Henry VIII. at the di&s;&s;olution of mo|na&s;teries, to &s;earch for, and &s;ave &s;uch books and records as were valuable among them. He was a man of great labour and indu&s;try.</P>
<P N="2">(2) HIS HIGHNESSE, meaning the &s;aid king Henry VIII. Our kings had not then the title of maje&s;ty.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="253">(3) What mote ytt be?] That is, what may this my&s;tery of ma&s;onry be? The an&s;wer imports, that it con&s;i&s;ts in natural, mathematical, and mechanical knowledge. Some part of which (as appears by what follows) the ma&s;ons pretend to have taught the re&s;t of mankind, and &s;ome part they &s;till conceal.</P>
<P N="4">(4) (5) Fyr&s;te menne yn the e&s;te, &amp;c.] It &s;hould &s;eem by this that ma&s;ons be|lieve there were men in the ea&s;t before Adam, who is called "the ffyr&s;te manne of the we&s;te;" and that arts and &s;ciences began in the ea&s;t. Some authors of great note for learning have been of the &s;ame opinion; and it is certain that Europe and Africa (which, in re&s;pect to A&s;ia, may be called we&s;tern countries) were wild and &s;avage, long after arts and politene&s;s of manners were in great perfection in China, and the Indies.</P>
<P N="6">(6) The Venetians, &amp;c.] In the times of monki&s;h ignorance it is no wonder that the Phenicians &s;hould be mi&s;taken for the Venetians. Or, perhaps, if the people
<PB N="10" REF="254">
were not taken one for the other, &s;imili|tude of &s;ound might deceive the clerk who fir&s;t took down the examination. The Phenicians were the greate&s;t voyagers among the ancients, and were in Europe thought to be the inventors of letters, which perhaps they brought from the ea&s;t with other arts.</P>
<P N="7">(7) Peter Gower.] This mu&s;t be ano|ther mi&s;take of the writer. I was puz|zled at fir&s;t to gue&s;s who Peter Gower &s;hould be, the name being perfectly Engli&s;h; or how a Greek &s;hould come by &s;uch a name: But as &s;oon as I thought of Pythagoras, I could &s;carce forbear &s;mi|ling, to find that philo&s;opher had under|gone a metemp&s;yco&s;is he never dreamt of. We need only con&s;ider the French pronunciation of his name, Pythagore, that is Petagore, to conceive how ea&s;ily &s;uch a mi&s;take might be made by an un|learned clerk. That Pythagoras travelled for knowledge into Egypt, &amp;c. is known to all the learned; and that he was initi|ated into &s;everal different orders of prie&s;ts, who in tho&s;e days kept all their learning &s;ecret from the vulgar, is as well known.
<PB N="11" REF="255">
Pythagoras al&s;o made every geometrical theorem a &s;ecret, and admitted only &s;uch to the knowledge of them, as had fir&s;t undergone a five years &s;ilence. He is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the inventor of the 47th propo&s;ition of the fir&s;t book of Euclid, for which, in the joy of his heart, it is &s;aid he &s;acrificed a hecatomb. He al&s;o knew the true &s;y&s;tem of the world, lately revived by Copernicus; and was certainly a mo&s;t wonderful man. See his life by DION HAL.</P>
<P N="8">(8) GRECIA MAGNA, a part of Italy formerly &s;o called, in which the Greeks had &s;ettled a large colony.</P>
<P N="9">(9) Wy&s;eacre.] This word at pre&s;ent &s;ignifies &s;impleton, but formerly had a quite contrary meaning. Wei&s;ager, in the old Saxon, is philo&s;opher, wi&s;eman, or wizard, and having been frequently u&s;ed ironically, at length came to have a direct meaning in the ironical &s;en&s;e. Thus, Duns Scotus, a man famed for the &s;ubtilty and acutene&s;s of his under|&s;tanding, has, by the &s;ame method of
<PB N="12" REF="256">
irony, given a general name to modern dunces.</P>
<P N="10">(10) Groton.] Groton is the name of a place in England. The place here meant is Crotona, a city of Grecia Magna, which in the time of Pythagoras was very populous.</P>
<P N="11">(11) Fyr&s;te made.] The word MADE I &s;uppo&s;e has a particular meaning among the ma&s;ons: perhaps it &s;ignifies, initiated.</P>
<P N="12">(12) Maconnes haueth communyca|tedde, &amp;c.] This paragraph hath &s;ome|thing remarkable in it. It contains a ju&s;tification of the &s;ecrecy &s;o much boa&s;ted of by ma&s;ons, and &s;o much blamed by others; a&s;&s;erting that they have in all ages di&s;covered &s;uch things as might be u&s;eful, and that they conceal &s;uch only as would be hurtful either to the world or them&s;elves. What the&s;e &s;ecrets are, we &s;ee afterwards.</P>
<P N="13">(13) The artes, agricultura, &amp;c.] It &s;eems a bold pretence this of the ma&s;ons,
<PB N="13" REF="257">
that they have taught mankind all the&s;e arts. They have their own authority for it; and I know not how we &s;hall di&s;|prove them. But what appears mo&s;t odd is, that they reckon religion among the arts.</P>
<P N="14">(14) Arte of ffyndinge neue artes.] The art of inventing arts, mu&s;t certainly be a mo&s;t u&s;eful art. My lord Bacon's No|vum Organum is an attempt towards &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind. But I much doubt, that if ever the ma&s;ons had it, they have now lo&s;t it; &s;ince &s;o few new arts have been lately invented, and &s;o many are wanted. The idea I have of &s;uch an art is, that it mu&s;t be &s;omething proper to be applied in all the &s;ciences generally, as algebra is in numbers, by the help of which, new rules of arithmetic are, and may be found.</P>
<P N="15">(15) Prei&s;e.] It &s;eems the ma&s;ons have great regard to the reputation as well as the profit of their order; &s;ince they make it one rea&s;on for not divulging an art in common, that it may do honour to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it. I think in this particular
<PB N="14" REF="258">
they &s;hew too much regard for their own &s;ociety, and too little for the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P N="16">(16) Arte of keepyng &s;ecrettes.] What kind of an art this is, I can by no means imagine. But certainly &s;uch an art the ma&s;ons mu&s;t have: For though, as &s;ome people &s;uppo&s;e, they &s;hould have no &s;e|cret at all, even that mu&s;t be a &s;ecret which being di&s;covered would expo&s;e them to the highe&s;t ridicule: and there|fore it requires the utmo&s;t caution to conceal it.</P>
<P N="17">(17) Arte of chaunges.] I know not what this means, unle&s;s it be the tran&s;|mutation of metals.</P>
<P N="18">(18) Facultye of Abrac.] Here I am utterly in the dark.</P>
<P N="19">(19) Univer&s;elle longage of maconnes.] An univer&s;al language has been much de&s;ired by the learned of many ages. It is a thing rather to be wi&s;hed than hoped for. But it &s;eems the ma&s;ons pretend to have &s;uch a thing among them. If it be
<PB N="15" REF="259">
true, I gue&s;s it mu&s;t be &s;omething like the language of the Pantomimes among the ancient Romans, who are &s;aid to be able, by &s;igns only, to expre&s;s and deliver any oration intelligibly to men of all na|tions and languages. A man who has all the&s;e arts and advantages, is certainly in a condition to be envied: But we are told, that this is not the ca&s;e with all ma&s;ons; for though the&s;e arts are among them, and all have a right and an oppor|tunity to know them, yet &s;ome want ca|pacity, and others indu&s;try to acquire them. However, of all their arts and &s;ecrets, that which I mo&s;t de&s;ire to know is, "The &s;kylle of becommynge gude and parfyghte;" and I wi&s;h it were commu|nicated to all mankind, &s;ince there is nothing more true than the beautiful &s;en|tence contained in the la&s;t an&s;wer, "That the better men are, the more they love one another." Virtue having in it&s;elf &s;omething &s;o amiable as to charm the hearts of all that behold it.</P>
