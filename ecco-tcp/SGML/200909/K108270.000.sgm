<P>REMARKS On the Opinions of &s;ome of The mo&s;t celebrated Writers on CROWN LAW, Re&s;pecting the due Di&s;tinction between MANSLAUGHTER and MURDER:</P>

<P>That the plea of <HI>&s;udden Anger</HI> cannot remove the imputa|tion and guilt of <HI>Murder,</HI> when a <HI>Mortal Wound</HI> is wil|fully given <HI>with a weapon:</HI></P>
<P>That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to <HI>voluntary Man&s;laughter</HI> in Rencounters, and in &s;udden Affrays and Duels, is <HI>indi&s;criminate,</HI> and without foundation in Law:</P>
<P>And that <HI>impunity</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es of <HI>voluntary Man&s;laughter</HI> is one of the principal cau&s;es of the continuance and pre|&s;ent increa&s;e of the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> and <HI>di&s;graceful</HI> practice of Duelling.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE, including <HI>gentlene&s;s, patience</HI> and an unaf|fected <HI>placability</HI> in our behaviour, even to|wards tho&s;e men who injure and affront us, is manife&s;tly required of all men, who profe&s;s the true religion; and yet, unhappily for the Chri&s;tian world, this mo&s;t obvious doc|trine of the <HI>go&s;pel of peace,</HI> is too com|monly either mi&s;under&s;tood, or el&s;e ab&s;o|lutely rejected, though the <HI>temporal</HI> as well as the <HI>eternal happine&s;s</HI> of mankind, greatly depends upon a con&s;cientious and proper ob&s;ervation of it. For a man can|not be a true Chri&s;tian without ob&s;erving this doctrine; and yet, &s;o generally received is the oppo&s;ite and contradictory doctrine, concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of revenging every per&s;onal affront with &s;word and pi&s;tol, for
<PB N="iv" REF="5">the &s;ake of, what is fal&s;ely called, <HI>honour,</HI> that a true Chri&s;tian is rarely to be met with! Nay, we are fallen into &s;uch gro&s;s depravity, that the writer of a late pub|lication on <HI>"the principles of penal law,"</HI> has ventured to a&s;&s;ert, (though he is in other re&s;pects, as I am informed, a &s;en&s;ible and in|genious young gentleman) that <Q>the judge condemns the duelli&s;t, whil&s;t he &s;carcely knows how in his own heart to di&s;ap|prove his behaviour.</Q> (p. <HI>224.</HI>) So that one would &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;tianity to be almo&s;t entirely extinct among&s;t us, if its principles are &s;o little regarded, <HI>even in our courts of ju&s;tice,</HI> where they ought to be held mo&s;t &s;acred. My readers, perhaps, will &s;tart at &s;uch an idea in the&s;e enlightened days of reformation; but I will even go further, and venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the Europeans not only cea&s;e to be Chri&s;tians, but will no longer de&s;erve the name even of
<PB N="v" REF="6"><HI>men,</HI> if they per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the mo&s;t indi&s;|pen&s;ible principles of the laws of God and nature: for nothing de&s;erves to be e&s;teemed <HI>human</HI> that is <HI>unrea&s;onable;</HI> and the de|pravity, of which I complain, is not only in|compatible with the laws of God, but ab|&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>common &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Let us view the character of the <HI>mo|dern man of honour</HI> (fal&s;ely &s;o called) who thinks it incon&s;i&s;tent with his reputa|tion, to pa&s;s over a per&s;onal affront with that Chri&s;tian &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which the go&s;pel requires of all men, without exception.</P>
<P>Such an one perhaps will alledge, that his <HI>honour</HI> obliges him, whenever he re|ceives an affront, to <HI>call out</HI> his adver|&s;ary, or <HI>to accept his challenge,</HI> le&s;t his <HI>courage</HI> &s;hould be que&s;tioned; and therefore in &s;uch ca&s;e, the one mu&s;t give, and the other take, what is commonly called
<PB N="vi" REF="7"><HI>gentleman-like Satisfaction.</HI> But let us examine this perver&s;ion of words. The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to both parties is the ri&s;k both of <HI>body</HI> and <HI>&s;oul,</HI> in the perpetration of a mo&s;t <HI>di&s;honourable, ba&s;e,</HI> and <HI>cow|ardly felony;</HI> which cannot, therefore, be <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> whatever the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> of it may be. It is <HI>Felony;</HI> becau&s;e no man can give, or accept, a challenge, with|out being guilty of <HI>Wilful Murder,</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antagoni&s;t; which I hope is proved in the cour&s;e of the following tract.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is <HI>di&s;honourable,</HI> becau&s;e it is an open violation of the indi&s;pen&s;ible prin|ciples enjoined in the two great command|ments of the &s;upreme Law, viz. the <HI>love of God,</HI> and the <HI>love of our neighbour:</HI> for, in this re&s;pect, the offender is upon the &s;ame foot|ing as culprits for <HI>burglary, theft,</HI> or any other felony; the <Q><HI>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</HI></Q> being equally
<PB N="vii" REF="8">applicable to all of them; and the common law of England e&s;teems no man qualified to be a member of &s;ociety, who wants this principle. The act is therefore highly <HI>di&s;|honourable;</HI> and to u&s;e a &s;till more humi|liating term of the &s;ame import, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, Thirdly, that it is al&s;o <HI>ba&s;e;</HI> becau&s;e it affords the mo&s;t apparent proof of a <HI>little Soul</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nec Chri&s;tiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt, &s;ed et philo&s;ophi, qui dixerunt <HI>pu&s;illi e&s;&s;e animi con|tumeliam ferre non po&s;&s;e,</HI> ut alibi o&s;tendimus,</Q> &s;ays the learned Grotius, in his 2d book De jure Belli et Pacis, p. 172.</NOTE>; being, <HI>in reality,</HI> a <HI>brutal</HI> revenge; <HI>brutal</HI> becau&s;e <HI>unrea&s;onable;</HI> (for how can <HI>Honour</HI> be vindicated or retrieved by the com|mi&s;&s;ion of a <HI>notorious Felony?)</HI> and what is <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;graceful to hu|man nature, and therefore is truly <HI>ba&s;e.</HI> And la&s;tly, it is <HI>cowardly,</HI> (that is, when it can|not be imputed to <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Folly</HI>) be|cau&s;e a man &s;ubmits to it contrary to the light of his own rea&s;on, <HI>for fear</HI> his <HI>courage</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="9">&s;hould be called in que&s;tion; and yet <HI>he has not courage enough</HI> to with&s;tand the bar|barous prejudices of a depraved world, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;ome temporal inconvenien|cies: and <HI>the &s;lavi&s;h Fear</HI> which he enter|tains of the&s;e (for <HI>cowards</HI> always dread the pre&s;ent evil mo&s;t) deprives him of that <HI>rea&s;onable fear,</HI> which he ought to entertain of God's judgment, becau&s;e he thinks it at a di&s;tance, though, he knows, it mu&s;t inevita|bly follow!&mdash;I condemn no man in particular; God forbid! I &s;peak of the que&s;tion only in ge|neral: inveterate prejudices and cu&s;toms may perhaps afford &s;ome excu&s;e in particular ca&s;es to &s;ome <HI>Individuals,</HI> who have <HI>igno|rantly</HI> yielded thereto: but as <HI>ignorance</HI> is di&s;graceful to <HI>humanity,</HI> I &s;incerely wi&s;h that all per&s;ons may enter into as careful an examination of this que&s;tion as I have done, by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime, but al&s;o
<PB N="ix" REF="10">be prevented from attempting to defend what is pa&s;t, and thereby afford the be&s;t proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart.</P>
<P>This abominable practice of duelling, which of late years has increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t alarming degree, may chiefly be attributed (I humbly conceive) to the improper indul|gence which our Engli&s;h courts of ju&s;tice, for about two centuries back, have &s;hewn to per&s;ons <HI>convicted of killing in &s;udden affrays and rencounters,</HI> through a fal&s;e idea of mercy due to human frailty, in ca&s;es of <HI>&s;udden provocation</HI> without pre|&s;erving the proper di&s;tinction of tho&s;e ca&s;es wherein homicide, in <HI>&s;udden anger,</HI> is really excu&s;able by the laws of God, and of this kingdom; and the improper precedents, which have ari&s;en from this <HI>indi&s;criminate and corrupt practice,</HI> have &s;o mi&s;led the more modern writers on <HI>Crown Law,</HI> that
<PB N="x" REF="11">even the greate&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doctrines on the &s;ubject of Man&s;laughter, which are ab&s;olutely incompatible with the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions</HI> to be ob|&s;erved between <HI>wilful murder</HI> and <HI>man|&s;laughter,</HI> which they them&s;elves have laid down in other parts of their works: and it is on the authority of the&s;e ju&s;t <HI>di&s;tinctions,</HI> with the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences ari&s;ing therefrom, (and not on my own pre&s;umption,) that this cen&s;ure is founded; which the following tract I hope will clearly demon|&s;trate.</P>
<P>But as my readers might &s;eem to give too much credit to an incon&s;iderable per&s;on like my&s;elf, were they, (without a previous intimation of what is propo&s;ed,) to ri&s;que any lo&s;s of time in the peru&s;al of the argu|ments and proofs at large, on which my
<PB N="xi" REF="12">vindication for this attempt depends, I think it my duty to &s;tate the &s;ubject and intention of the tract, as briefly as I can, in this pre|fatory addre&s;s, that my readers may, thereby, be enabled to judge, without much lo&s;s of time, whether the matter is of &s;uf|ficient con&s;equence to merit any more of their attention.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned my opinion, that <Q>No man can give or accept a chal|lenge to fight <HI>with weapons,</HI> on any private difference whatever, without being guilty of <HI>wilful murder</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antagoni&s;t.</Q> And the intention of the following tract is to &s;hew, that the writers on Crown Law have no ju&s;t war|rant for admitting the contrary doctrines, which they have laid down concerning <HI>&s;ud|den affrays</HI> and <HI>rencountres,</HI> viz. that <HI>the voluntary killing</HI> of a man on a <HI>&s;udden
<PB N="xii" REF="13">provocation</HI> is only to be e&s;teemed <HI>Man|&s;laughter,</HI> and, as &s;uch, is intitled to the be|nefit of clergy. And they have al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>an a&s;&s;ault</HI> is a &s;ufficient provocation to ju&s;tify a <HI>voluntary man&s;laughter.</HI></P>
<P>Now, certain it is, that &s;ome allow|ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a <HI>&s;udden provocation,</HI> in con&s;idera|tion of the extreme frailty of human na|ture, provided that there are no circum|&s;tances of <HI>malice</HI> in the ca&s;e. As if (for in|&s;tance) a man, <HI>in &s;udden anger,</HI> &s;hould &s;trike another, merely <HI>with his fi&s;t,</HI> or a &s;mall <HI>cane,</HI> or <HI>&s;tick,</HI> meaning only to correct, and &s;hould <HI>accidentally kill;</HI> this would be, properly, <HI>man&s;laughter;</HI> which, tho' it is deemed <HI>Felony</HI> (as the act of &s;triking, or beating another per&s;on is, in it&s;elf, <HI>unlaw|ful,</HI>) is neverthele&s;s <HI>pardonable</HI> both by the laws of God and man. But when two per&s;ons fight with <HI>dangerous weapons,</HI> an
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"><HI>intention of killing</HI> is <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> by the <HI>weapons;</HI> and <HI>&s;uch intention</HI> renders the man&s;laughter <HI>voluntary,</HI> which is the &s;ame thing as <HI>wilful;</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>"ma|lice prepen&s;ed"</HI> (which excludes the be|nefit of clergy) is nece&s;&s;arily <HI>implied,</HI> though the &s;udden anger be but a moment before the fatal &s;troke; for <HI>"malice prepen&s;ed"</HI> is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke, <Q>That is (&s;ays he) <HI>voluntary,</HI> and of &s;et pur|po&s;e, though done <HI>upon a &s;udden occa|&s;ion:</HI> for if it be <HI>voluntary</HI> the law implieth <HI>malice.</HI></Q><HI>3</HI> In&s;t. <HI>c. xiii. p. 62.</HI></P>
<P>And yet the &s;ame great lawyer in p. <HI>55,</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>voluntary man&s;laughter</HI> upon <HI>&s;ome &s;udden falling out,</HI> as di&s;tinct from <HI>murder;</HI> which cannot, in rea&s;on, be true; for if the <HI>killing be voluntary,</HI> the evil and <HI>malicious intention</HI> is nece&s;&s;arily in|cluded in the act, even though the fatal blow be given merely with <HI>the hand,</HI> or a
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"><HI>&s;mall cane</HI> or <HI>&s;tick,</HI> which I have before mentioned as pardonable ca&s;es, when the <HI>killing</HI> is not intended; for a <HI>voluntary &s;triking,</HI> without intention to kill, is indeed pardonable, though death en&s;ues; but a <HI>vo|luntary killing</HI> is &s;o far from being &s;o, that the law, according to lord Coke's own rule, <HI>implieth malice;</HI> and, con&s;equently, the &s;ame mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, be e&s;teemed <HI>Murder,</HI> and not meerly <HI>Man&s;laughter;</HI> becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary marks, whereby <HI>man&s;laughter</HI> ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, are ab&s;olutely wanting therein: for <HI>man&s;laughter</HI> mu&s;t be "without <HI>malice</HI> expre&s;s or implied" (<HI>1</HI> Hale <HI>466. 4</HI> Black&s;tone <HI>191</HI>) "<HI>Murder</HI> being ag|gravated" (&s;ays lord Hale) <Q>with malice pre&s;umed or <HI>implied,</HI> but man&s;laughter not.</Q> And yet all the&s;e great and excel|lent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the &s;ame error of treating the <HI>voluntary branch</HI> of killing, as bare <HI>Homicide,</HI> or <HI>man&s;laugh|ter;</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="16">whereas, all the olde&s;t writers agree, that <HI>killing</HI> is pardonable only in ca&s;es <HI>of inevi|table nece&s;&s;ity</HI> (Bracton, lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>120.</HI> b. Fleta lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>23.</HI>) And the learned judge Staunford &s;ays <Q>That the whole matter con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>inevitable nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> without which the <HI>killing</HI> is by <HI>no means excu&s;able,</HI> (n'e&s;t a&s;cun voi excu&s;|able.</Q> P. C. lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI>)</P>
<P>Now, the ab&s;urd and depraved notions of <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>gentleman-like &s;atisfaction,</HI> of which I complain, could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, if every conqueror in a duel, who kills his antagoni&s;t, was &s;ure of being <HI>hanged up</HI> as an ignominious <HI>felon,</HI> for his own <HI>gentleman-like &s;atisfaction;</HI> and there|fore I apprehend, that the diabolical practice of &s;ettling private differences with &s;word and pi&s;tol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of puni&s;hment due to <HI>voluntary man|&s;laughter,</HI> through the mi&s;taken conce&s;&s;ions of the Writers on Crown Law, and the fal&s;e
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">mercy of Juries, in con&s;ideration of <HI>&s;udden anger;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>impunity</HI> fo&s;ters vice and depravity; but more e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of <HI>wilful man&s;laughter,</HI> impunity ought to be e&s;teemed the bane of &s;ociety; as <HI>the guilt of blood</HI> is thereby thrown upon a whole na|tion or country; for it is a &s;upreme law, that <Q>who&s;o &s;heddeth <HI>man's blood,</HI> by <HI>man</HI> &s;hall <HI>his blood</HI> be &s;hed.</Q> Gen. <HI>ix. 6.</HI> And I hope I have proved by incontrovertable extracts from the laws of God, that the &s;aid judgment is inevitably incurred by all <HI>voluntary killing,</HI> except in the legal pro|&s;ecution of ju&s;tice, and in the nece&s;&s;ary de|fence of our lives and properties; &s;o that <HI>no Man on earth</HI> (and much le&s;s in Eng|land<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">For in England, not only the laws of God, but the laws of the land forbid the pardoning of <HI>wilful man&s;laughter,</HI> &s;o that even <HI>the king him&s;elf</HI> is ab&s;o|lutely re&s;trained from it. See an act of the 2 Edw. III. whereby it is ordained, that a charter of pardon <Q>&s;hall not be granted, but only where the king may do it by his oath; that is to &s;ay, where a man &s;layeth an|other in <HI>his own defence,</HI> or <HI>by misfortune.</HI></Q></NOTE> has any legal or ju&s;t right to par|don
<PB N="xvii" REF="18">or remit the puni&s;hment due to <HI>mur|der,</HI> or <HI>voluntary man&s;laughter</HI> (which are the &s;ame crime, and equally <HI>unpardon|able</HI> in this world); for &s;uch an indulgence is not only a manife&s;t &s;in again&s;t Almighty God, but al&s;o again&s;t the community at large, or country; <Q>for <HI>Blood it defileth the land;</HI> and the <HI>land</HI> cannot be clean&s;ed of <HI>the blood</HI> that is &s;hed therein, but <HI>by the blood of him that &s;hed it,</HI></Q> Numb. <HI>xxxv. 33.</HI> This is not a ceremonial law, but a law of morality, founded in divine ju&s;tice, which mu&s;t, therefore, be ever binding.</P>
<P>I may probably be charged with an un|pardonable temerity for pre&s;uming to cen|&s;ure the writings of &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t learned men that this nation, per|haps, ever produced; and I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the ri&s;k and ill con&s;equences to

<P>The errors, of which I complain, were not originally occa&s;ioned by thefe cele|brated authors, but by a previous corrupt practice in the courts, which had been in|troduced by degrees, and at la&s;t unhappily prevailed, through a fal&s;e idea of mercy

The proper di&s;tinction to be ob&s;erved is, when the <HI>intention</HI> of <HI>killing</HI> is not nece&s;&s;arily <HI>implied</HI> in the act it&s;elf; as when a man &s;trikes another merely with his hand, or fi&s;t, in &s;udden anger; or thru&s;ts him &s;udden|ly from him, whereby he falls and receives a hurt, which occa&s;ions death; in the&s;e, and &s;imilar ca&s;es, the &s;triking, or thru&s;t|ing is, indeed, <HI>voluntary,</HI> yet the <HI>killing,</HI> or <HI>man&s;laughter,</HI> is not &s;o, but entirely un|de&s;igned and unexpected; which proper and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction the Law Com|mentators have unhappily neglected. For, though the act of <HI>&s;triking or thru&s;t|ing in anger</HI> bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to <HI>malice,</HI> and though &s;uch an act is cer|tainly <HI>unlawful in it&s;elf,</HI> yet it is rea&s;on|able to make &s;ome allowance for the

And in this lenity we are ju&s;tified by the laws of God, whereby &s;uch ca&s;es of man&s;laughter <HI>in &s;udden anger,</HI> as I have mentioned, were excu&s;ed without any other penalty than that of bani&s;hment to a city of refuge. <Q>If he <HI>thru&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>The thru&s;ting,</HI> here mentioned (which &s;ome wri|ters &s;eem to have mi&s;under&s;tood) does not mean a <HI>thru&s;t</HI> with a &s;word or other weapon; for the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> has no &s;uch meaning, but properly &s;ignifies a violent thru&s;ting or &s;hoving away, as with the hand; or a &s;udden-driving away, as chaff is drove before the wind, as Bythner remarks, <Q>Proprie dicitur de vento, qui rapta pro&s;equitur.</Q> Lyra prophetica, p. 6</NOTE> him <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">)without <HI>enmity</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Here a proper di&s;tinction is pre&s;erved between <HI>&s;udden anger</HI> and <HI>enmity.</HI></NOTE> (<GAP DESC="foreign"> Numb. xxxv. 22.)&mdash; the congregation &s;hall re&s;tore him to the city of his refuge, &amp;c.</Q> (v. 25.)

Neverthele&s;s, Mr. Hawkins ventures to a&s;&s;ert a very different doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown, 1 Book c. xxviii. &sect; 24. <Q>I &s;ee no rea&s;on (&s;ays he) why a per&s;on, who without Provocation is a&s;&s;aulted by another in any place what&s;oever, in &s;uch a Manner as plainly &s;hews an intent to murder him, as by di&s;charg|ing a Pi&s;tol, or pu&s;hing at him with a drawn Sword, &amp;c. may not <HI>ju&s;tify Kill|ing</HI> &s;uch an A&s;&s;ailant, as much as if he had attempted to rob him: for is not he, who attempts to Murder me (&s;ays he) more injurious than he
<PB N="59" REF="78">who barely attempts to rob me? And can it be more ju&s;tifiable to fight for my goods than for my Life?

<P>But how&s;oever &s;pecious this argument may appear, I hope I have already pro|ved <HI>"by the general Tenor of our Law|books;"</HI> that the <HI>Ju&s;tifiable Killing</HI> of a Man mu&s;t be through <HI>an inevitable nece&s;&s;ity:</HI> and therefore what Mr. Haw|kins afterwards advances, in his com|pari&s;on of &s;uch a ca&s;e with Homicide in <HI>&s;e Defendendo,</HI> cannot in the lea&s;t ju&s;tify either his opinion on that point, or his a&s;&s;ertion concerning <Q>the general Tenor of the Law-books.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="79">He endeavours to repre&s;ent <HI>the Volun|tary Killing</HI> of a Man as <HI>Ju&s;tifiable Ho|micide,</HI> and con&s;equently he mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e it a le&s;s crime than <HI>Excu&s;able Ho|micide,</HI> in <HI>&s;e Defendendo.</HI></P>
<P>He founds his opinion in the &s;uppo|&s;ition of "&s;ome <HI>precedent Quarrel</HI>" in the latter, "in which" (&s;ays he) <Q>both parties always are, or at lea&s;t may <HI>ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to have been, in &s;ome fault, &s;o that the nece&s;&s;ity, to which a Man is at length reduced to kill another, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure pre|&s;umed to be owing to him&s;elf:</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But may it not, as <HI>"ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed"</HI> that the per&s;on, who <HI>Kills</HI> without <HI>&s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;ity,</HI> is al&s;o <HI>"in &s;ome fault?"</HI> Is not the <HI>Pre&s;umption of Law</HI> again&s;t him (as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn) by the <HI>bloody</HI> FACT, when he cannot prove that <HI>he endea|voured,</HI>

<P>The &s;ingle circum&s;tance that <HI>the Killer</HI> was under <HI>no nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of endeavouring to retreat, and avoid the a&s;&s;ailant, is not only a proof that <HI>his own intentions</HI> (though he might not be the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or) were nearly as criminal, as tho&s;e he attri|butes to the <HI>per&s;on Killed,</HI> but it al&s;o af|fords a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that <HI>the latter</HI> was not very &s;trenuous or &s;anguine, either in his attack, or in his &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>inten|tion to commit murder:</HI> &s;o that the very pretence, by which Mr. Hawkins en|deavours to ju&s;tify &s;uch a <HI>voluntary Kill|ing,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall to the ground,
<PB N="62" REF="81">whenever <HI>the Killer</HI> is unable to prove, that he endeavoured to avoid the attack<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I have already made the nece&s;&s;ary exceptions con|cerning Civil Officers in the legal Execution of ju&s;|tice, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>And even in ca&s;es where it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>per&s;on Killed</HI> might
<PB N="63" REF="82">really have had <HI>"an intent to murder,"</HI> we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not puni&s;h men <HI>merely</HI> for their <HI>"criminal intentions"</HI> without &s;ome fact! and, therefore, it would be highly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Law, without &s;ome apparent nece&s;&s;ity, would entru&s;t every individual, indi&s;criminately, with a &s;upream Authority, which it de|nies <HI>even</HI> to the Highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn Courts of Ju&s;tice; I mean an Authority to inflict capital puni&s;hment without a previous Trial <HI>per pares;</HI> and that mere|ly for <HI>"a Criminal Intention;"</HI> which, in many ca&s;es, might as ea&s;ily, (through fear, pa&s;&s;ion, or violent prejudice) be mi&s;taken, or imaginary, as be real!</P>
<P>And therefore <Q><HI>an A&s;&s;ault upon the Per&s;on</HI></Q> is not (as I have before in|&s;i&s;ted in p. 5. again&s;t the opinion of Judge
<PB N="64" REF="83">Fo&s;ter) <Q>a Provocation &s;ufficient to free <HI>the Party Killing</HI> from the Guilt of Murder.</Q></P>
<P>The ca&s;e of Gentlemen in the Army, neverthele&s;s, &s;eems peculiarly hard upon &s;uch unhappy occa&s;ions. The fir&s;t prin|ciple of their profe&s;&s;ion is <HI>Courage;</HI> and the World, in general, is too de|praved to di&s;tingui&s;h in what ca&s;es a Man of <HI>true Courage</HI> may retreat <HI>with honour</HI> from the A&s;&s;ault of an Enemy; &s;o that Military Men are liable to be <HI>un|ju&s;tly</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed, whenever they act <HI>rea|&s;onably</HI> in ca&s;es either of in&s;ult, or a&s;|&s;ault!</P>
<P>Yet, at the &s;ame time, it ought to be remembered, that tho&s;e men who &s;ubmit to <HI>the Slavi&s;h Yoke</HI> of other Men's de|praved opinions or unrea&s;onable cu&s;toms
<PB N="65" REF="84">(in contradiction to that <HI>natural Know|ledge</HI> of <HI>Good and Evil,</HI> which they in|herit, in common with the re&s;t of Man|kind, from our fir&s;t Parents), cannot <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be deemed <HI>Men of Honour;</HI> and, con&s;e|quently, are unworthy of <HI>Rank</HI> in the honourable Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms.

<P>I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels: &s;ometimes Pa&s;&s;ion and fal&s;e Pride, but more frequently in|con&s;ideration, and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man (as I have before hinted) occa&s;ion the ba&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and conformity to tho&s;e <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>unrea&s;onable notions of Honour,</HI> which almo&s;t univer&s;ally prevail.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;o much blame the Military Gentlemen, for this unnatural depravity, as I do the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Law; who ought to have &s;et them a better example, and yet, have rather contributed to <HI>the ignorance of the times,</HI> by the many <HI>gro&s;s perver&s;ions</HI> of <HI>our Law,</HI> which they
<PB N="67" REF="86">have admitted into the Books. Gentle|men of the Army are not obliged, in|deed, to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law, but they mu&s;t not forget that they are <HI>Men,</HI> as well as <HI>Soldiers;</HI> and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of <HI>Men,</HI> (viz. that of thinking for them&s;elves, and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their <HI>own Con&s;cience,</HI> as Members of the Community), they are unfit for <HI>Briti&s;h Soldiers,</HI> of whom the <HI>Law</HI> requires an acknowledgment of <HI>her &s;upremacy.</HI></P>
<P>For the Law will not excu&s;e an <HI>un|lawful Act</HI> by a Soldier, even though he commits it by <HI>the expre&s;s Command</HI> of the highe&s;t military Authority in the King|dom: and much le&s;s is the Soldier obliged to conform him&s;elf <HI>implicitly</HI> to the mere opinions and fal&s;e Notions of
<PB N="68" REF="87">Honour, which his Superiors may have unfortunately adopted. &mdash; Even in pub|lick military Service, or warlike Expe|ditions by <HI>National authority,</HI> the Law manife&s;tly requires the Soldier <HI>to think for him&s;elf;</HI> and to con&s;ider, before he acts in any war, whether the &s;ame be <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> for, if it be otherwi&s;e, the Com|mon Law of this Kingdom will <HI>impute</HI> to him <HI>the Guilt</HI> of <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>And though the Law does not actually puni&s;h &s;uch general Crimes, as may un|fortunately have obtained, at any time, the Sanction of Government, yet the time will certainly come, when all &s;uch temporizing military <HI>Murderers</HI> mu&s;t be re&s;pon&s;ible for the innocent blood that is &s;hed in an <HI>unju&s;t</HI> War, if they have ren|dered them&s;elves <HI>acce&s;&s;aries to it by an im|plicit,</HI> and, therefore, <HI>criminal</HI> obedience
