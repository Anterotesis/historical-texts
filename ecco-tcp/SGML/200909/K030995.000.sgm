<P>SINCE the Publication of my Book on <Q>the Inju&s;tice and dangerous Ten|dency of Tolerating Slavery in England,</Q> &s;everal unfore&s;een circum&s;tances ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e obli|ged me to con&s;ider that &s;ubject more &s;trictly, in order to obviate the in&s;inuations of &s;ome intere&s;ted Per&s;ons, who &s;till en|deavour to inculcate and maintain, even in this I&s;land, the ungenerous We&s;t Indian Notions concerning property in Slaves.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e dangerous princip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;everal violent Outrages have lately been commit|ted
<PB N="4" REF="4">for the recovery of &s;uch pretended property; and &s;everal Negroes have been knocked down and kidnapped by Ruffians, hired for that purpo&s;e, and have been hur|ried on Ship Board in order to be tran&s;por|ted to the We&s;t Indies, in open Contempt of the Engli&s;h Laws, and of the Habeas Corpus Act in particular, which denounces heavy Penalties again&s;t tho&s;e who attempt to tran&s;port <HI>any Per&s;on whatever</HI> from this Kingdom again&s;t their Will: for I have &s;hewn in my former Treati&s;e in Pages 20 to 28 that Negroes, and all other Aliens are the <HI>King's Subjects,</HI> when re&s;iant in this Kingdom; and that they are entitled to the Protection of the Engli&s;h Laws in ge|neral, and of the Habeas Corpus Act in particular. The &s;ame Arguments are fur|ther inforced in Pages 152 to 159.</P>
<P>In Pages 136 to 146 of the &s;ame Book will be found a full An&s;wer to &s;uch Argu|ments as had then been offered, concerning <HI>any right which the Ma&s;ter may have ac|quired to the perpetual &s;ervice of a Man;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5">and in Pages 163 and 164 it is (I hope) demon&s;trated that the Service of <HI>a Slave</HI> cannot ju&s;tly be compared to the Service of <HI>an Apprentice;</HI> and that <HI>a Contract</HI> cannot be <HI>implied</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, as &s;ome learned Men have in&s;inuated.</P>
<P>In the fourth and la&s;t Part of the &s;aid Tract the Doctrines of <HI>Villenage</HI> are &s;hewn to be <HI>ob&s;olete,</HI> &s;o that the lea&s;t Claim of <HI>perpetual Service,</HI> cannot be ju&s;tified thereby.</P>
<P>The&s;e References to my former Work are in&s;erted here, partly to avoid a recapi|tulation of the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary points, and partly, that tho&s;e, who have any concern at pre&s;ent in &s;uch matters, may thereby be enabled to con&s;ider and examine the&s;e &s;everal Heads without the trouble of reading the whole Book; which is not &s;o compendious as the Author could wi&s;h, it having been wrote at &s;everal different Periods, as occa&s;ion offer|ed, and new Arguments were oppo&s;ed, during the time that an Action (which was &s;hamefully prolonged) depended again&s;t the Author and one of his Brothers, for having
<PB N="6" REF="6">accidentally (not officiou&s;ly) a&s;&s;i&s;ted a poor Negro Servant who was kidnapped and con|fined in the Poultry Compter without a Warrant, and there &s;old to a We&s;t-India Planter to be tran&s;ported to Jamaica.</P>
<P>It has already been proved, in the places before referred to, that <HI>no right whatever</HI> can be acquired to <HI>the perpetual Service of a Man</HI> without a <HI>Contract,</HI> and that &s;uch a <HI>Contract</HI> cannot be <HI>implied,</HI> unle&s;s the free Con&s;ent of both Parties is <HI>implied</HI> likewi&s;e, and clearly proved. Neverthele&s;s as &s;ome &s;ordid and tenacious Contenders for this kind of imaginary Property are &s;till &s;o in|con&s;iderate as to ri&s;que all the Penalties of a <HI>Premunire,</HI> be&s;ides heavy Fines, by ven|turing to &s;eize and carry away by force their quondam Slaves, I am willing for the pre|&s;ent to admit their <HI>Plea of Private Property</HI> merely that I may examine the Weight of it, and balance it with the Negroes <HI>Pro|perty in his own Per&s;on,</HI> which, in a Land of Ju&s;tice, doth equally demand &s;ome &s;hare of our Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">The Authors and Abettors of the &s;can|dalous and Inhuman Outrages of which I complain, cannot po&s;&s;ibly ground their De|fence on any other Point what&s;oever, than this &s;ingle Plea <HI>of private Property,</HI> and the nece&s;&s;ary obligation of the Courts of Ju&s;tice to <HI>&s;ecure to every Man his own.</HI> Now if a Negro Man, or any other human Being whatever, is con&s;idered as <HI>property</HI> in this Country, he falls under the Head of <HI>Chat|tels</HI> and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily (&s;o far I mean as the Ma&s;ter's right ought to be con&s;idered) be ranked under that denomination.</P>
<P>Now A CHATTEL is <HI>"res e&s;timabilis;"</HI> a thing to be valued; a thing merely of a <HI>pecuniary</HI> con&s;ideration; and the Slaveholder, accordingly, rates his &s;uppo&s;ed Property in <HI>a Man</HI> at <HI>a ba&s;e price,</HI> not more, upon an average, than the value of <HI>a good Hor&s;e,</HI> viz. 30 <HI>l.</HI> 40 <HI>l.</HI> or 50 <HI>l. to the di&s;grace of hu|man nature:</HI> whereas, on the other hand, the Negro (though con&s;idered as <HI>a Chattel</HI> with re&s;pect to the Ma&s;ter's claim, yet be|ing him&s;elf, al&s;o, <HI>a Man</HI>) has certainly a

Now let the idea of the CHATTEL, even at the highe&s;t price it will bear, be weighed and compared with the &s;ubject of the la&s;t men|tioned maxim, and <HI>let Ju&s;tice hold the &s;cale!</HI>&mdash;Shall we doubt whether the <HI>E&s;timable</HI> claim or <HI>the Ine&s;timable</HI> claim is to be pre|ferred?</P>

<P>It is true, indeed, that the Law, in this ca&s;e, may &s;eem to &s;uffer (or permit) a wrong by the Ma&s;ter's lo&s;ing his &s;uppo&s;ed right and property; but if we con&s;ider, that the admitting <HI>&s;uch a Property</HI> would be a want of <HI>Mercy</HI> in the Law, nay, even an act <HI>of Cruelty</HI> (which the Law abhors) to|wards tho&s;e per&s;ons who have <HI>a &s;uperior,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>a natural intere&s;t</HI> in the determina|tion of this que&s;tion, it mu&s;t appear to de|mon&s;tration, that the Law <HI>doth no wrong,</HI> when it rejects the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> claim of <HI>e&s;timable</HI> property, in favour of that <HI>natural intere&s;t</HI> which is <HI>ine&s;timable:</HI> And therefore, how|&s;oever the imaginary proprietor may think
<PB N="10" REF="10">him&s;elf aggrieved, yet the law is vindi|cated herein, when we con&s;ider that every claim <HI>of Property</HI> is ab&s;olutely <HI>unju&s;t in it&s;elf,</HI> and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;et a&s;ide through <HI>the mercy</HI> of the Law, if it interferes, or is in|con&s;i&s;tent with that <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> claim to <HI>per&s;onal &s;ecurity,</HI> which the law of this kingdom hath <HI>always favoured;</HI> for <HI>"the Law of England is a Law of Mercy."</HI> <Q>LEX ANGLIAE EST LEX MISERICORDIAE, 2 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 315.</Q> &s;o that each Slaveholder mu&s;t &s;till be obliged to allow, <Q><HI>that the Law</HI> (even in this unavoidable deci&s;ion again&s;t him&s;elf) <HI>doth injury to no man:</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Lex nemini operatur iniquum.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>nemini facit injuriam.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let the Slaveholder remember, al&s;o, that his being thus deprived of his imaginary Property, cannot be con&s;idered otherwi&s;e (let him make the mo&s;t of it) than merely, as <HI>a private lo&s;s;</HI> whereas, if &s;uch an <HI>unna|tural right</HI> be admitted without due con&s;i|deration of the &s;uperior <HI>Per&s;onal Right</HI> of the Negro, a wor&s;e Va&s;&s;alage, than the An|cient

<P>Thus &s;tands the Common Law, with re|&s;pect to the point in que&s;tion; and it is not (I apprehend) in the lea&s;t altered by Sta|tute Law; &s;o that unle&s;s the Advocates for Slavery can prove that it is altered, we may &s;afely conclude with the following maxim, that <Q><HI>whatever was at Common Law, ana is not taken away by Statute, remaineth &s;till,</HI> Co.

<P>A more modern, but not le&s;s re&s;pectable Author, has furni&s;hed us with a Maxim nearly to the &s;ame effect, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Tho&s;e that forego (or &s;et a&s;ide) the Law of the Land, de&s;ervedly incur from thence a perpetual &s;tain of Infamy.</Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt.</HI> Sir Ed.

<P>Thus the <HI>Plea of private property in the Per&s;ons of Men</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall to the
<PB N="14" REF="14" MS="y">Ground, when it is mea&s;ured by the Maxims of the Common Law.</P>
<P>I have not, de&s;ignedly, done any inju&s;tice to this Plea; and, tho' I may, perhaps, have treated my &s;ubject injudiciou&s;ly, and not according to Method, yet I defy the mo&s;t intere&s;ted advocate for Slavery to give more real weight or value to &s;uch kind of pro|perty than what I have already &s;tated, if, at the &s;ame time, the Learned Judge Black|&s;tone's arguments concerning the three Origins of Slavery be duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I have quoted the&s;e Arguments at length in my former Tract (from page 141 to 145) but &s;hall, neverthele&s;s, repeat them here and pledge them as unan&s;werable by the mo&s;t able Ca&s;ui&s;t, or even by the Learned Author him&s;elf were he to undertake it. But this I &s;peak only comparatively, refer|ring to his great <HI>abilities,</HI> not his <HI>will:</HI> for though I have been obliged to guard again&s;t &s;ome doubtful expre&s;&s;ions in other part of his Works (See my former Tract pages 136 to 141) yet I have too good an opinion of
<PB N="15" REF="15">that worthy Gentleman to conceive that he will ever entertain any real inclination for &s;o ungenerous a ta&s;k.</P>
<P><Q>The three origins of the right of Sla|very, (&s;ays he) a&s;&s;igned by Ju&s;tinian, are all of them built upon fal&s;e foundations. As fir&s;t, Slavery is held to ari&s;e <HI>"jure gentium,"</HI> from a &s;tate of captivity in war; whence Slaves are called <HI>mancipia, qua&s;i manu capti.</HI> The conqueror, &s;ay the Civilians, had a right to the life of his captive; and, having &s;pared that, has a right to deal with him as he plea&s;es. But it is untrue po&s;ition, when taken generally, that, by the law of nature or nations, a man may kill his ene|my: he has only a right to kill him, in particular ca&s;es; in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for &s;elf-defence; and it is plain this ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;ince the victor did not actually kill him, but made him pri&s;oner. War is it&s;elf ju&s;tifiable only on principles
<PB N="16" REF="16">of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; and therefore it gives no other right over pri&s;oners, but merely to di&s;able them from doing harm to us, by confining their per&s;ons: much le&s;s can it give a right to kill, torture, abu&s;e, plunder, or even to en&s;lave an enemy, when the war is over. Since there|fore the right of <HI>making</HI> Slaves by capti|vity, depends on a &s;uppo&s;ed right of &s;laughter, that foundation failing, the con&s;equence drawn from it mu&s;t fail like|wi&s;e. But &s;econdly, it is &s;aid, that Sla|very may begin <HI>"jure civili;"</HI> when one man &s;ells him&s;elf to another. This, if only meant of contracts to &s;erve or work for another, is very ju&s;t: but when ap|plied to &s;trict Slavery, in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of old Rome, or modern Barbary, is al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible. Every &s;ale implies a price, a <HI>quid pro quo,</HI> an equivalent given to the &s;eller in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer: but what equivalent can be given for life and liberty, both of which (in ab&s;olute Slavery) are held to
<PB N="17" REF="17">be in the ma&s;ter's di&s;po&s;al?&mdash;His pro|perty al&s;o, the very price he &s;eems to receive, devolves <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> to his ma&s;ter, the in&s;tant he becomes his Slave. In this ca&s;e therefore the buyer gives nothing, and the &s;eller receives nothing: of what validity then can a &s;ale be, which de&s;troys the very principles upon which all &s;ales are founded?&mdash;La&s;tly, we are told, that be&s;ides the&s;e two ways by which Slaves <HI>"fiunt,"</HI> or are acquired, they may al&s;o be hereditary: <HI>&s;ervi naj|cunter;"</HI> the children of acquired Slaves are, <HI>jure naturae,</HI> by a negative kind of birth-right, Slaves al&s;o. But, this being built on the two former rights, mu&s;t fall together with them. If nei|ther captivity, nor the &s;ale of one's &s;elf, can by THE LAW OF NATURE AND REASON reduce the parent to Slavery, much le&s;s can they reduce the offspring. <HI>Upon the&s;e principles</HI> THE LAW OF ENG|LAND <HI>abhors, and will not endure the exi&s;t|ence of Slavery, within this nation:</HI></Q> &s;o that
<PB N="18" REF="18">when an attempt was made to introduce it&punc; <Q>by &s;tatute 1 Edward VI. c. 3. which ordained, that all idle vagabonds &s;hould be made Slaves, and fed upon bread, water, or &s;mall drink, and refu&s;e meat; &s;hould wear a ring of iron round their necks, arms, or legs; and &s;hould be compelled by beating, chaining, or otherwi&s;e, to perform the work a&s;&s;igned them, were it never &s;o vile; <HI>the &s;pirit of the nation could not brook this condition&punc;</HI> even in the mo&s;t abandoned rogues; and therefore this &s;tatute was repealed in two years afterwards.</Q> Coms. 1. Vol. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</P>
<P>Thus it is clear that there can be no claim of right to <HI>the perpetual Service of a man</HI> which is not ORIGINALLY FOUNDED EITHER IN RAPINE THEFT OR NOTORI|OUS INJUSTICE. <Q>For it mu&s;t be obvious to every per&s;on, who is not blinded by the de&s;ire of gain,</Q> &s;ays the author of a Short Account of the Slave Trade, &amp;c. which I cau&s;ed to be reprinted in 1768, p. 64) <Q>that the Right, by which the&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="19">men hold the Negroes in Bondage, is no other than what is derived from tho&s;e who &s;tole them, who, having no other Title, but that which Robbers have over their Prey could not convey any better to the purcha&s;er; and that therefore to continue to hold them in Bondage, for wordly Advantage, by no other right than that which tho&s;e guilty men give them, is con&s;enting to, and partaking of their Guilt.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore when a Notorious Outrage and Breach of the Peace is committed under the pretence of any &s;uch <HI>groundle&s;s claim of &s;ervice,</HI> the Magi&s;trate who neglects to <HI>re|lieve</HI> the per&s;on oppre&s;s'd, and <HI>to puni&s;h</HI> the Offenders, is certainly a partaker of their Guilt; and no upright and con&s;cientious Judge (who does not &s;et up his <HI>own will above the laws of the Land</HI>) can po&s;&s;ibly entertain any <HI>doubt in his mind</HI> about the puni&s;hment of &s;uch Offenders: for when the Laws of the Land, and e&s;pecially the Habeas Corpus Act, are expre&s;sly and
<PB N="20" REF="20">clearly <HI>on one Side of the Que&s;tion</HI> (without the lea&s;t exception whatever concerning any difference or di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons,) and when the <HI>only plea</HI> on the <HI>other &s;ide of the Que&s;tion</HI> is ab&s;olutely without Foundation either in Natural Equity or the e&s;tabli&s;hed Law and Cu&s;toms of this Country, what room can there be for <HI>doubt?</HI> and how would a Judge be able to ju&s;tify an Arre&s;t of Judgment in &s;uch a ca&s;e?</P>
<P>Every Judge is (or ought to be) &s;worn, that <HI>he will mini&s;ter Ju&s;tice indifferently</HI> (or without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons) <HI>to all Men.</HI>&mdash; <Q>Se ju&s;titiam mini&s;traturum indifferenter omnibus hominibus.</Q> (Forte&s;cue de Laudibus Leg. Angliae, Chap. 51.) And therefore if the Laws and E&s;tabli&s;hed Cu&s;|toms of the land with re&s;pect to the pre|&s;ent Que&s;tion make <HI>no di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons</HI> (whether Bond or Free, White or Black) neither can a Judge, without ri&s;quing <HI>the guilt of Perjury.</HI></P>
<P>I have proved in Page 159 of my for|mer Tract, <Q>that the Laws of England
<PB N="21" REF="21">(in the late Reign) were e&s;teemed obnox|ious to any involuntary Bondage without a ju&s;t cau&s;e, and to all <HI>private jurisdictions what&s;oever;</HI> &s;o that <HI>an exten&s;ion of</HI> THE INFLUENCE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Act of 20 Geo. II. intituled an Act for taking away and aboli&s;hing the heretable juri&s;dictions in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, &amp;c.</NOTE> BENEFIT AND PROTEC|TION</Q><HI>of the&s;e laws</HI> was con&s;idered as a relief to our Fellow Subjects in Scotland from all <HI>private</HI> oppre&s;&s;ion. I mean the late pernicious <HI>Va&s;&s;alage</HI> of Scotland; the extinction of which has happily produced the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing State of Arts, Trade, and Manufactories among&s;t our Brethren in that part of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>But as the claim of <HI>private property in the per&s;ons of men</HI> is the very root and foundation of the wor&s;t kind of <HI>Va&s;&s;alage,</HI> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, if any Judge &s;hould hereafter venture to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the Engli&s;h Laws in con&s;ideration of <HI>any &s;uch kind of pre|ten&s;ions whatever,</HI> he might be &s;aid to &s;tab the con&s;titutional freedom of two Great and
<PB N="22" REF="22">ancient Kingdoms at one blow. For how &s;hould our fellow &s;ubjects at the other end of the I&s;land be able to tru&s;t in the parlia|mentary Promi&s;e of the <Q><HI>Influence, Benefit and Protection of the King's Laws</HI></Q> to be <HI>extended</HI> as far as Scotland, if the &s;aid Laws were really liable to be rendered <HI>ineffectual,</HI> even in England, by a mere <HI>groundle&s;s doubt</HI> of one &s;ingle Judge.</P>
<P>A <HI>Doubt</HI> is certainly a very in&s;uffi|cient excu&s;e for an <HI>arre&s;t of Judgment,</HI> in any ca&s;e whatever, unle&s;s <HI>"&s;trong and probable Grounds"</HI> are alledged to ju&s;tify it; but a <HI>groundle&s;s doubt</HI> upon the pre&s;ent que&s;tion would be more parti|cularly criminal; becau&s;e it would, pro|bably, tend to the introduction of the <HI>diabolical</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Note in my former Tract, page 153, where this hard Epithet is proved.</NOTE> Tyranny and Inju&s;tice of our We&s;t Indian Colonies, whereby <HI>human Nature is vilifyed and degraded to the Rank and level of brute Bea&s;ts;</HI> for not only the gro&s;&s;e&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ion of our <HI>fellow man</HI> but even <HI>murder</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. page 66 and 67.</NOTE>

The la&s;t of the&s;e pages, (73) is now earne&s;tly recommended by the Author to the &s;e|rious peru&s;al of all per&s;ons who have any influence in Government, if they &s;incerely wi&s;h pro&s;perity to England.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whatever tends to the &s;ame point (viz. the <HI>degradation of human nature</HI> and the in|troduction of that con&s;ummate wickedne&s;s which mu&s;t of cour&s;e prevail <HI>wherever Slavery is tolerated</HI>) does certainly promote the Work and Service of the <HI>Grand Enemy of Mankind,</HI> and con&s;equently ought to be e&s;temed highly offen&s;ive to Almighty God.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons may, perhaps, alledge in vindication of the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed doubt</HI> above men|tioned, that the Legi&s;lature has, at diffe|rent times, given encouragement to the <HI>African Slave Trade,</HI> (however dete&s;table, and <HI>pernicious to mankind</HI> it may be e&s;teemed) and that the &s;ame ought to be accounted
<PB N="24" REF="24" MS="y">an acknowledgment, that <HI>Property in Slaves</HI> is, in &s;ome degree, <HI>lawful.</HI></P>
<P>Such Arguments, and In&s;inuations I have frequently heard, but let the Advocates for Sla|very make the mo&s;t of them they can, yet &s;hall they not be able to avail them&s;elves of any &s;uch &s;trained, con&s;equential Doctrines: for &s;uppo&s;e that the Legi&s;lature &s;hould, un|warily, happen to <HI>do wrong</HI> in any parti|cular point what&s;oever, and that any one of their Subjects in a judicial character &s;hould, in&s;tead of giving them warning of <HI>the evil,</HI> be ready to go before them in it, and &s;hould even &s;hew him&s;elf prone to carry the <HI>mi&s;|chief</HI> to a much higher pitch, than the <HI>Le|gi&s;lature</HI> ever conceived or intended, by en|deavouring to render ineffectually one of their mo&s;t &s;olemn acts, relating, in &s;ome re|&s;pect, to the &s;ame point, which we will &s;uppo&s;e to have remained <HI>unrepealed</HI> and <HI>in full force,</HI> and which might therefore have been u&s;ed as a ju&s;t and hone&s;t expedient to &s;ave <HI>the honour</HI> of the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> and cor|rect the inadvertent <HI>evil.</HI> Such a neglect
<PB N="25" REF="25" MS="y">and contempt of a <HI>po&s;itive and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tatute,</HI> added to a di&s;regard of <HI>natural as well as national Ju&s;tice,</HI> ought to be e&s;teemed as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for condemning &s;uch a man as <HI>a mo&s;t undutiful &s;ubject, and dangerous Politician.</HI></P>
<P>But, to carry the Argument &s;till further, let us &s;uppo&s;e (what I tru&s;t will never come to pa&s;s) that even the <HI>Legi&s;lature it&s;elf</HI> &s;hould become &s;o mi&s;erably degenerate as to repeal, or annul, the Habeas Corpus Act, and adopt, in&s;tead of it, the mo&s;t horrid and diaboli|cal of the We&s;t Indian Laws; yet, even in this ca&s;e, the natural <HI>unlawfulne&s;s</HI> and wickedne&s;s of &s;uch principles as tho&s;e laws contain, would <HI>&s;till remain;</HI> for <Q>No Legi&s;|lature on Earth, which is the &s;upreme power in every Civil Society, can alter the Nature of things, or make that to be lawful, which is contrary to the Law of God, the &s;upreme Legi&s;lator and Go|vernor of the World. Mi&s;chief may be framed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Law, but
<PB N="26" REF="26">if it be, it is mi&s;chief &s;till, as much &s;o as it was before it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, tho' its being &s;o may make Men in&s;en&s;ible of their Guilt, or bold and fearle&s;s in the Perpetration of it; for too many, among Chri&s;tians, are, contrary to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Ex|hortation, more influenced by the Fear of Man, than by the Fear of God.&mdash;It is really a &s;erious Subject, and I own it rai&s;es a &s;erious concern in my Mind, that &s;uch Barbarity &s;hould be &s;uffered in Chri&s;tian Nations. It is enough to make a Man's Heart ach, unle&s;s he has not lo&s;t all Love and Regard to his Kind, to think that &s;o many Thou&s;ands of the Hu|man Race &s;hould be &s;acrificed every year to that greedy voracious God <HI>Mammon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Short Account of the Slave Trade, p. 52.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The Number of Negro Slaves bought <HI>in one Year only</HI> (viz. 1768) on the Coa&s;t of Africa, from Cape Blanco to Rio Longo, amounted to 104, 100 Per&s;ons, according to a particular &s;tate of that Trade in&s;erted in the Gazetteer of the 8th of July, 1769.
<PB N="27" REF="27">The&s;e mi&s;erable creatures, it is &s;aid, <Q><HI>were bought by Barter for European and Indian Goods, chiefly at</HI> 15 <HI>l. Sterling each.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now it is dreadful to con&s;ider <HI>what multitudes of men</HI> mu&s;t have been <HI>killed</HI> merely in the attempt to take &s;o many wret|ched Captives for &s;ale; and again <HI>what multitudes,</HI> out of &s;o large a number, would <HI>die,</HI> as u&s;ual, in their pa&s;&s;age to the We&s;t Indies and America either of Grief and de&s;pair, or by being inhumanly &s;tifled in the Holds of Ships; be&s;ides the large proportion (nearly one half) that would <HI>die</HI> of the &s;ea&s;oning, (as it is called) after their arrival in the plantations; and la&s;tly that all the remainder of <HI>this va&s;t multitude of</HI> 104, 100 <HI>mi&s;erable human beings</HI> will probably be <HI>worn out</HI> by hard &s;ervice and oppre&s;&s;ion in the &s;pace of about 16 years, or le&s;s, ac|cording to the average rate of &s;ome calcula|tions that have been publi&s;hed. The&s;e con&s;i|derations, I &s;ay, mu&s;t needs in&s;pire us with indignation and horror even though the evil, at pre&s;ent, is at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from
