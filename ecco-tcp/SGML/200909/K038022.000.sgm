Hopkins</HI>&mdash;With plea&s;ure acquie&s;ces in the general opinion, that the principal &s;ucce&s;s, and uncommon applau&s;e the &s;ub&s;equent petite piece has been received with, is very ju&s;tly attributed to the great attention and excellence of the performance; for which they have his be&s;t thanks, and warme&s;t good wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>And with regard to any merit he might lay claim to in the production, the &s;ituation of an author, as de&s;cribed in the underwritten pa&s;&s;age

<P>AND are you &s;ure, Tabby, the po&s;tman had no letters for me to-day? I am cer|tain it was his rap; which has more mu&s;ic in it to the ears of an expecting lover, than the mo&s;t favourite air of a Fi&s;her or Bach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tabby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, were I young and hand&s;ome as you are, I would not be <HI>balk'd</HI> about it; for tho' Mr. Montague neglects writing, Sir John Seymour would not, had he the &s;ame opportunity.</P>

<P>Lord, madam, he does <HI>the favor</HI> &s;o genteely, and &s;o privately, there's no refu&s;ing the gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I charge you, as you value your place, to decline any thing his genero&s;ity offers; as you are not to learn of my father's having early contracted me to another abroad.</P>

<SPEAKER>Tabby.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, madam, I &s;hould think a bird in the cage is worth two in the air. And as to my old ma&s;ter Sir Jacob, &s;o as he parts not with his money, he cares not, I believe, had you married the Hoity-toity man from beyond &s;ea, or were to elope with our Robin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, you give your tongue a liberty very unbecoming, depending, I &s;uppo&s;e, for your &s;ecurity on the confidence I have placed in you: But as my prior engagement prevents, I fear, any ho|nourable conclu&s;ion with Sir John, I beg no more impertinence on that head.</P>

<P><STAGE>[returned from walking, fatigued].</STAGE> Mercy on me! what a pity it is one cannot take a hackney|coach as formerly I u&s;ed a &s;eat in a Playhou&s;e, at half price! It would be the certain making of me! Where|as this walking every day to and from 'Change creates &s;uch an appetite, that I fore&s;ee I &s;hall eat my&s;elf out of hou&s;e and home before Chri&s;tmas; unle&s;s, indeed, I &s;hould be fortunate enough to be laid up with a &s;trong fit of the gout, or vi&s;ited by that old family complaint the rheumati&s;m: Rare di&s;orders both for economy! no eating, no drinking, no!

<P>Not any thing &s;ucceeds that I undertake; deceived at home, di&s;appointed abroad, every day brings on new expences, and no money to pay with.</P>

<P>Is it then &s;aying any ill of you, Sir, to &s;ay you are rich?</P>

<P>Can they &s;ay wor&s;e? for, &s;uppo&s;ing me rich, how can I be &s;afe? &s;hall I not be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated? will not my hou&s;e be &s;urrounded night and day with thieves? Double locks, treble keys, and a hamper of padlocks, will not avail me any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your affairs are as de&s;perate as you would have them thought, permit me to enquire what it is you have in that &s;trong box in your &s;tudy, &s;o curiou&s;ly chain'd to the wall, which you keep lock'd with treble keys, and vi&s;it &s;o regularly twice a-day?</P>

<P><STAGE>[eagerly].</STAGE> Strong box, child? what &s;trong box? I have no &s;trong box:&mdash;That you &s;ee is an old iron che&s;t, bought as a fixture with the hou&s;e; and I keep it locked becau&s;e there is nothing in it fit to be &s;een.</P>

<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then, Sir, are you to defray the ex|pences of my marriage, when&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jacob</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[interrupting her].</STAGE> Why that, child, is the very di&s;appointment I was mentioning. Your intend|ed hu&s;band Mr. Montague is coming over, it's true; but 'tis in his coffin, I hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir! in his coffin, &s;ay you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jacob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Our neighbour Wentworth has been with me this morning, with an account from abroad of his death in &s;ome ab&s;urd duel.&mdash;I don't like the&s;e &s;ame duels&mdash;&s;hall ne'er like them again&mdash;as by this means you are at pre&s;ent di&s;appointed of getting a hu&s;band&mdash;and I
<STAGE>[a&s;ide]</STAGE> in getting rid of a daughter. &mdash;Mercy on me! how care, as a body may &s;ay, mounts behind a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>manner</HI> of his death, Sir, I own affects me, and mu&s;t have felt it &s;everely, had not our know|ledge of each other been in its infancy when he left England. Are you acquainted, Sir, with any other particulars relative to this unhappy affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jacob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not any; one misfortune I thought &s;uf|ficient to know at a time. Be&s;ides, my thoughts were immediately turned on the hopes of recovering &s;ome|thing from his executors on the contract; for though he has lo&s;t his life, child, it is no rea&s;on I &s;hould lo&s;e my money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir! recover on the contract? And is it po&s;&s;ible &s;uch an idea could enter into your mind at an hour like that you received the fatal news in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jacob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Night and day, child, bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be minded: "Take care of bu&s;ine&s;s, and it will take care of you," is an excellent &s;aying; and as the opinion I mean to take will co&s;t me nothing, why, if I find my&s;elf without a remedy, I'll e'en oblige you, and think no more about it. So, child, I'll ju&s;t &s;tep in, &s;end Robin to market, and then to cou&s;in <HI>Capias,</HI> make a ca&s;e of it as of a pauper, and return immediately.

<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unde&s;ignedly do we often-times take pains to di&s;cover the very thing we would mo&s;t wi&s;h to conceal. Nor am I, I fear, if I examine my own heart, le&s;s guilty in this particular than my father; for with all my caution and reprimands to this maid of mine, I fear &s;he is more in the &s;ecret of my heart about Sir John Seymour than I could wi&s;h her. Surely, 'tis a &s;trange weakne&s;s our &s;ex are ever guilty of, in thus making confidants of tho&s;e who&s;e very intere&s;t it is often-times to betray us.

<P>Well, Tabby, this attention and con&s;tancy of Sir John's, knowing me contracted to another at the time he fir&s;t profe&s;s'd a partiality for me, I own is more than I expected; for the men in general, let them &s;ay what they will, are <HI>a mere changeable &s;ilk.</HI></P>

<STAGE>Enter Sir Jacob, ha&s;tily and agitated.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jacob.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, &s;o, &s;o! misfortune on misfortune! and no remedy on the contract! How all mankind con&s;pire to torment me&mdash;But may not cou&s;in Capias have been guilty of a little mi&s;take in practice here? <HI>The greate&s;t lawyers have been.</HI> What if I &s;end a Quaere or two to the Attorney-General of the Ledger? <HI>He is in full practice,</HI> and gives his opinion gratis. But then, like many other opinions, it may be worth nothing when I've got it; as he's often more <HI>knotty</HI> than his tye. Sure I was born a martyr to di&s;appointments!</P>

<SP>

<P>Well, well! I have done, child: Go on!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Flavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But knowing the early contract you made with Mr. Montague, he de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s, and declined carrying his partiality for me beyond a gene|rous and polite friend&s;hip; but being &s;ince inform'd of the unhappy fate of Mr. Montague, has ventured to write on that &s;ubject, with a tender of his hand and heart, in ca&s;e I confirm'd the truth of this information.</P>

<P>Why, really, Sir Jacob, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it has more the appearance of the one than the other, from the &s;trange reception my &s;udden arrival has met with from you; which ought to be what the French call <HI>enjou&eacute;,</HI> and not hold a <HI>barbare</HI> Engli&s;h con&s;ultation to know whether you are at home or not.</P>

<P>As the affair then between us does not require &s;ecrecy, that gentleman, by virtue of a con|tract, now &s;eeks to rob me of the only woman I adore, and am my&s;elf contracted to!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neville.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will never then accompli&s;h his de&s;ign, or interrupt your felicity, Sir; as I have been informed, within this hour, he died &s;oon after I left that place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, but the report is totally groundle&s;s; as I this morning &s;aw him alive and well; and Sir Jacob Thrift, the lady's father, has taken every po&s;&s;ible method to be a&s;&s;ured of his iden|tity, and by letters and other credentials it is now be|yond a doubt. And as you &s;ay you have &s;ome know|ledge of him, if you &s;hould chance to meet him be|fore I &s;ee him, let me intreat you to tell him, that if he merits the hand he a&s;pires to, Sir John Sey|mour expects to hear from him as a man of honour ought, who glories in being his rival, and hope my

<P>Sir, your &s;ervant. A &s;trange adventure this! I am actually lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment! Montague recovered, and now in England? In either ca&s;e, I will in&s;tantly return to Paris on the wings of love, to behold my charming Clari&s;&s;a once more, and prevail on her if po&s;&s;ible to be mine; for Sir John Seymour's &s;ituation is not more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than my own.</P>

<P>I'm for a nap then fir&s;t, Sir, if you plea&s;e; as I entirely agree with friend Sancho, that he was a wi&s;e man who fir&s;t invented &s;leep. Here are your letters, Sir

<SPEAKER>Neville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! what do I &s;ee? a letter directed to Clari&s;&s;a Montague? and to be left at Lowe's Hotel till called for?&mdash;What can this mean? I am in a maze!

<P>True, Sir.&mdash;What invention now?

<P>How then is this letter to be delivered, if you do not know where to find him?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trimwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>On &s;econd thoughts, Sir,&mdash;I recollect&mdash; he was to meet me in the Piazza; and if you plea&s;e to give me the letter, I will go find him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neville.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Trimwell, this letter concerns me nearly, and I am determined to open it.
<STAGE>[as if going to open it, half-breaks the &s;eal and &s;tops.]</STAGE>&mdash;And yet the indelicacy of &s;uch a &s;tep cannot be ju&s;tified; I will not, there|fore, open it. But charge you, as you regard my hap|pine&s;s, and your own intere&s;t, go find Richard in|&s;tantly, and learn from him where he is to carry the letter
<STAGE>[giving the letter];</STAGE> and be not long in your re|turn, as I expect a per&s;on with money, which, in ca&s;e of my ab&s;ence, you mu&s;t receive.</P>

<P><STAGE>[Looking at it].</STAGE> How's this? a letter from Paris, and &s;eal'd with Neville's arms!

<STAGE>[Examining it.]</STAGE> It has

<P><STAGE>[falling on his knees].</STAGE> On my knees, kind Sir, I entreat your forgivene&s;s! but there coming a letter al&s;o for me from an old withered relation of mine in the country, who wrote a hand I never could read, I applied to a civil good-natured gentleman to read it for me, and in my hurry gave him your letter for mine, which he re&s;ealed the moment we di&s;co|vered the mi&s;take.</P>
</SP>

<P>What a fortunate planet mu&s;t I have been born under, to have matters go on thus &s;wim|mingly! Egad, Trimwell, if your ma&s;ters will find you in belief, you will find them in lies, I warrant. What an immen&s;e &s;um now &s;hould I be worth to a prime-mini&s;ter, as a porter; for I can out-lie a cour|tier, a lover, a chamber-maid, a milliner's apprentice, a lawyer, or even the news-papers at a general election.</P>

<P>But I do not chu&s;e any &s;uch thing, Sir, or to part with you or the money out of my &s;ight,
