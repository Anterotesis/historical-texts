<HEAD>TO THE NOBLEMEN, GENTLEMEN AND Proprietors of Lands in Scotland, and Inhabitants at large.</HEAD>
<P>SCOTLAND as a part of the united kingdoms altho' having a right to the &s;ame protection from Government with its &s;i&s;ter kingdom, <HI>England;</HI> yet labours under &s;ome hard&s;hips, and even impo&s;ed by Act of Parliament, which the people of <HI>England</HI> know nothing about. And the&s;e are Burrow duties known by the name of <HI>impo&s;ts</HI> on <HI>Malt Liquors,</HI> which have of late years &s;pread them&s;elves as a plague over the face of this country. They began fir&s;t in the capital of the kingdom in the year 1693, an aera, when few cla&s;&s;es of men in this country knew their rights and privileges as &s;ubjects, or if they had been as well under&s;tood as at pre&s;ent, were unacquainted with the mode of application to parliament; all of which circum&s;tances, contributed to the Bill in fa|vours of the town of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> pa&s;&s;ing without op|po&s;ition impo&s;ing a duty of <HI>two pennies Scots</HI> on the pint of all <HI>malt liquors</HI> brewed, tap'd, or vended with|in
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">the privileges of &s;aid city. From which not only the Burrows and towns of con&s;equence, but every petty town have taken the hint, and have &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively applied to Parliament for &s;imilar Acts, and is now become almo&s;t an univer&s;al tax on this coun|try, <HI>viz.</HI> the towns of <HI>Edinburgh, Gla&s;gow, Dundee, Dunbar, Kel&s;o, Arbroath, Dalkeith, Pre&s;ton-pans, Bo-ne&s;s, Pai&s;ley, Port-gla&s;gow, Greenock,</HI> &amp;c. and there is great rea&s;on to believe, that private gentle|men, who have the &s;malle&s;t villages &s;ituated on na|vigable rivers, and who are not yet arrived at &s;uch a degree of con&s;equence as to have a magi&s;trate of any kind, allured by the &s;urpri&s;ing revenue which this tax rai&s;es, intend applying to Parliament for grants of the &s;ame nature; and Parliament, by no oppo&s;ition hav|ing ever been made, have overlooked them as un|connected either with the revenue, the landed in|tere&s;t, or the welfare of the people in general, but which are connected with all the&s;e three to a degree of more con&s;equence than is in general under&s;tood or attended to.</P>
<P>It is the univer&s;al complaint, that the <HI>malt liquors</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly <HI>porter</HI> and <HI>pale malt liquors,</HI> are not equal in quality to that brewed in <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">and the other towns in <HI>England,</HI> but it cea&s;es to be a matter of any wonder, when the Public are informed that the <HI>malt liquors</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> is loaded with 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> of the King's exci&s;e in <HI>impo&s;t</HI> payable to royal borrows and other &s;maller towns.</P>
<P>The trifling opinion, which the country entertains of <HI>two pennies Scots,</HI> and mankind in general of the fractions of a penny, has made this oppre&s;&s;ive tax pa&s;s unnoticed, not only by parliament, but by the landed intere&s;t of this country, both of whom ought to have &s;et them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to &s;o partial and oppre&s;&s;ive a burthen on this part of the kingdom. Trifling as <HI>two pennies Scots</HI> may appear, when taken by the pint, it is no le&s;s than 1 s. &s;terling on every 9 gallons which is 1/9 of the whole value of <HI>malt liquor</HI> at 1 s. <HI>per</HI> gallon; but burthen&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive as this mu&s;t appear to every con&s;iderate per&s;on, it is enormous when con&s;idered as a tax added to the ex|ci&s;e, which is &s;o heavy already, that when Lord North in the year 1779, laid 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the amount of the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, out of compa&s;&s;ion to the laborious part of the nation who are the con&s;umers of <HI>malt liquors,</HI> he exempted the brewery in both kingdoms; and in his &s;ub&s;equent taxes he has &s;till
<PB N="4" REF="4">paid &s;uch an attention to the brewery (no doubt from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its not being able to bear more) that he has all along exempted it, and even in the additional taxes on the <HI>malt,</HI> he provided a drawback of 10 d. <HI>per</HI> barrel on all <HI>malt liquor</HI> above the de|nomination of <HI>&s;mall beer,</HI> and 3 d. <HI>per</HI> barrel on this last &s;pecies, in lieu of the additional duty on the <HI>malt,</HI> and altho' this drawback is not an exact equivalent for the additional duty on the <HI>malt,</HI> yet it is plain he meant it to be &s;o, according to the be&s;t of his judg|ment and the information he had

For the above two barrels of <HI>malt liquor,</HI> which is 21&frac13; gallons, the brewer in <HI>Scotland</HI> pays 2 s. 4 d&frac13;. of <HI>im|po&s;t,</HI> which every body will find that will take the trouble of calculating is upon 8 s. 3 d. the amount of the exci&s;e on a barrel of <HI>porter</HI> and a barrel of <HI>&s;mall beer,</HI> no le&s;s than within the meere&s;t trifle of 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the amount of the duty taken com|plexly; and on <HI>&s;mall beer</HI> is no le&s;s than the exact double duty. What would the Noblemen and Gen|tlemen
<PB N="5" REF="5">and Inhabitants of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ay, were Govern|ment to lay a double tax or even 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the <HI>malt liquor</HI> of Scotland more than in England? The very mention of it mu&s;t &s;trike every per&s;on of any con&s;ideration with a&s;toni&s;hment, how any &s;pecies of manufacture could &s;upport &s;uch a load of taxes, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that the price of no kind of <HI>malt liquor</HI> has been rai&s;ed in Scotland, not|with&s;tanding of this enormous local tax. The fact is, that at the time the <HI>impo&s;t</HI> was impo&s;ed, the brewers found them&s;elves in po&s;&s;ession of a pretty good trade from the very low price of materials at that time, and having no denomination of money equivolent to <HI>two pennies</HI> Scots the amount of the tax, and not being allowed by the law to add it to the price of the pint or gallon, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to be charged the next highe&s;t duty, <HI>viz. &s;trong ale,</HI> were under the nece&s;&s;ity, in order to indemnify them&s;elves of taking the value of the tax (which is one ninth) out of the quality of the liquor.</P>
<P>Every body will &s;ee what a deba&s;ement of the li|quor would en&s;ue by taking the ninth part of malt out of the quality; to this deba&s;ement of the liquor mu&s;t be attributed the decrea&s;e of the brewing bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="6">in Scotland, which is evidently demon&s;trated by the decrea&s;e of the malt tax, as any body may be in|formed of, by appyling to the Exci&s;e Office at Edin|burgh. This deba&s;ement of the liquor does not operate in a common and ordinary proportion on the intere&s;t of the country, but in a threefold proportion. It is not only the lo&s;s of 1/9 part of the con&s;umption of the barley to the landed intere&s;t and to the farmer, but al&s;o 1/9 part of the revenue of the malt tax to Go|vernment, be&s;ides this deba&s;ement of the <HI>malt liquor,</HI> makes at the mo&s;t moderate calculation 1/9 le&s;s con|&s;umption of the liquor that is brewed, and 1/9 de|crea&s;e of quantity of malt is 2/9=&frac14; nearly, (being only 1/36 part le&s;s) &s;o that it is plain this tax does not operate to the prejudice of the revenue as 1/9, but as &frac14; decrea&s;e on the revenue of <HI>malt,</HI> likewi&s;e not as 1/9 but as &frac14; decrea&s;e of barley to the prejudice of the landed intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This tax in proportion as it decrea&s;es the revenue of the <HI>malt</HI> tax 2/9, it decrea&s;es the revenue of the ex|ci&s;e on the ale in the proportion of one ninth le&s;s con|&s;umed than would have been if this tax had not taken place, &s;o that it affects government in no le&s;s a pro|portion than 3/9, or &frac13; lo&s;s on the revenue of exci&s;e in Scotland.</P>

<P>Few in&s;tances, perhaps, have occurred that &s;hews in a more forcible light the dangerous tendency of ad|mitting the mo&s;t trifling tax to be levied on a com|mon nece&s;&s;ary of life. This e&s;timation the author hopes, will be thought very moderate, when it is con&s;idered, that additional duties have been laid on both <HI>malt</HI> and <HI>ale;</HI> and the price of materials have been annually advancing during the above period, all of which &s;hews, that the author's &s;uppo&s;ition of 1/9 le&s;s con&s;umption of ale in con&s;equence of the impo&s;t tax taking place in this country, from which all the&s;e calculations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken, <HI>Are too, too well founded,</HI> more e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that the above enor|mous &s;um has been lo&s;t to the country on the con|&s;umption of Edinburgh alone, exclu&s;ive of all the other parts of Scotland.</P>
<P>The author hopes, what he has &s;aid, will meet the attention of the Noblemen and Gentlemen, Lords of Council and Se&s;&s;ion, Barons of Exchequer, and Commi&s;&s;ioners of Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, as likewi&s;e the worthy Manufacturers and u&s;eful Mechanic and
<PB N="11" REF="11">Labourer, who are al&s;o intere&s;ted that this oppre&s;&s;ive tax &s;hould be aboli&s;hed in Scotland, to put them on a footing with their brethren manufacturers and la|bourers in England, as al&s;o hou&s;e-holders of all de|nominations, who&s;e intere&s;t it is to have as in Eng|land, a nouri&s;hing, &s;ound and whole&s;ome malt liquor.</P>
<P>The <HI>impo&s;t acts</HI> have the effect of a monoply again&s;t the inhabitants of every town where it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, in loading with an additional tax, one of the com|modities of life, and prevents people at a di&s;tance from relieving them by &s;erving them better and cheaper than their own brewers either can or choo&s;e to do, it being the intere&s;t of every community, to open the mo&s;t free communication for all &s;orts of provi&s;ions, and therefore it is their intere&s;t to op|po&s;e all &s;uch Acts.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is the intere&s;t of the community at large, and of the inhabitants of towns in particular to guard again&s;t magi&s;trates introducing by act of par|liament, and without their own con&s;ent; any &s;pecies of taxation, and carefully watching over any bill in its progre&s;s through the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the author of this addre&s;s takes the liberty to advi&s;e the inhabitants of corporated towns in all ca&s;es where magi&s;trates propo&s;e getting new acts of parliament,
<PB N="12" REF="12">to chu&s;e a committee of the mo&s;t worthy and re|&s;pectful of their number, unconnected with the council, to watch over the &s;teps the magi&s;trates and council take in &s;uch a piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, and that they would always employ a council at law to take care of their intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the ex|pence of which would be a mere trifle. But of all the ranks of men in the community, he would advi&s;e the brewers in Scotland at large, to be upon their guard when any revenue laws are applied for, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e avowed purpo&s;e is to &s;ubject them alone to a tax exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t of the inha|bitants, as all impo&s;t taxes on malt liquor are&mdash;taxes to the prejudice of the revenue, the landed intere&s;t, and the ruin of a re&s;pectable rank of citizens, who are &s;ubjected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> partial, local and unequal tax which their brethren the brewers of England know no|thing about.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and is &s;till averred by the abettors of this tax, that it is the inhabitants that pay the tax and not the brewers, and as this doctrine is indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly propagated among the inhabitants of the diffe|rent towns, the author begs the reader's indulgence, until he explodes this magi&s;terial doctrine calculated
<PB N="13" REF="13">to mi&s;lead the well meaning citizen who would &s;purn the idea of contributing by his con&s;ent to load his neighbour and fellow-citizen with a burthen&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive tax, of which he him&s;elf bears no part. It is well known that two-penny ale, at the Union of the two kingdoms, was &s;old at two-pence the Scots pint, the brewer had then the malt 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than at pre&s;ent, and yet every body knows, that the two-penny ale all over Scotland, is &s;old at the &s;ame price at this very moment. If this is the fact, the author begs the favour that the advocates for this impo&s;t tax will &s;ay, where the impo&s;t (which is &frac16; of a penny) is added to the price: But however trifling it appears on the pint, it is 1&frac13; of a penny on the gal|lon, and on a barrel of 36 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">che&s;ter mea|&s;ure, or twelve Scots gallons, is 16 d. which is the exact duty of exci&s;e on &s;mall beer, and con&s;equently <HI>&s;mall beer in Scotland,</HI> pays exactly double duty of what it is charged with in England. It is in this way (&s;ay the trifling denomination of the tax) that the iniquity and oppre&s;&s;ion of it has e&s;caped the notice of the legi&s;lature and all good citizens. And unle&s;s the inhabitants at large pay the tax, where is the equity of charging a few individuals as much as all the in|habitants be&s;ides, for the ornamenting of any town
<PB N="14" REF="14">whatever. And what is more extraordinary, per|haps tho&s;e very people who pay this oppre&s;&s;ive tax, do not re&s;ide within the precincts of the town, as is the ca&s;e in many places having an impo&s;t. In &s;hort, every view you take of this tax, it is fraught with ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>It is much to the honour of this country at the pre&s;ent period, that a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m prevails among the Noblemen and Gentlemen, to promote the manufactures of their own country, which if followed out with &s;teadine&s;s and per&s;everance will rai&s;e this country to a degree of opulence unknown to former ages.
