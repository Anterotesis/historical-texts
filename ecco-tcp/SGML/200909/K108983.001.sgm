<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>To neglect any proper opportunity of te&s;tifying my devotion to
your Lord&s;hip, would be unju&s;t, unworthy, and ungrateful; there|fore, I
only comply with the mo&s;t manife&s;t pro|priety in humbly &s;oliciting your
protection to this work.</P>
<P>Yet, my Lord, though the propriety is <PB N="ii" REF="4">
&s;trong, though the ta&s;k is indi&s;pen&s;ible, though the &s;ubject warmly
gratifies my be&s;t pride, yet never was effort &s;o uncommonly
difficult.&mdash;Great men have patronized public characters, and the
encouragement of genius has been, in many in&s;tances, the mo&s;t brilliant
di&s;tinction of Engli&s;h nobility: but there is no example of &s;uch an act
of beneficence as that which your Lord&s;hip has extended towards me. No
bene|factor ever had the power to confer a favour of equal magnitude, nor were
tho&s;e favours that have been conferred given from any &s;uch noble motive, or
independent principle.</P>
<P>It was re&s;erved for your Lord&s;hip to dig|nify patronage, by
blending &s;olicitous conde&s;|cen&s;ion with &s;pontaneous liberality.</P>
<P>If then men of great and celebrated talents have found their
thanks inadequate to inferior favours, in attempting to de&s;cribe the true 
<PB N="iii" REF="5"> colour of my acknowledgments, how greatly mu&s;t I fail,
who can expre&s;s &s;o little, and who have been honoured &s;o much.</P>
<P>My &s;anctuary is in my mind. No man's feelings can be more alive
than mine are, nor was there ever an occa&s;ion on which they were &s;o
&s;en&s;ibly or &s;o worthily rou&s;ed. I humbly hope, therefore, your
Lord&s;hip will, in your goodne&s;s, take my thanks upon tru&s;t, and give me
credit for that gratitude which glows in my heart, but which no language can
convey to my pen.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE cannot be any thing 10 fallacious as the cavils of tho&s;e
authors who complain of being unju&s;tly treated by the public. The judgment of
the public, like tho&s;e laws to which they owe their exi&s;tence, as a
re&s;pected and a happy people&mdash;&s;pight of the factious few, who&s;e
impotent clamour &s;erves, as its &s;hadow, to di&s;play the light of
rea&s;on&mdash;never fails to decide firmly, yet indulgently; and nothing can
more completely confirm character and &s;ecurity, than the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate
determination of the one, and the unbia&s;&s;ed deci&s;ion of the other.</P>
<P>But, though the judgment of the public and the laws of the land
contain in them&s;elves all we know of rea&s;on and equity, yet nothing can be
&s;o difficult as to make a fair appeal to either. The &s;ons of chi|cane, in
both, &s;o clog up the cour&s;e, and &s;o poi&s;on the air, that the career is
fatiguing and dangerous; <PB N="ii" REF="7"> and thus many, with fair
preten&s;ions, turn back, their pur&s;uits and purpo&s;es unaccompli&s;hed, and
ra|ther re&s;ign the honours of the race, than &s;trive to reach a delu&s;ive
goal, to obtain an unavailing vic|tory.</P>
<P>Perhaps the painter, who had been ruined by going to law, without
bringing any thing to i&s;&s;ue, had the&s;e ideas in his mind when he drew a
picture of ju&s;tice, &s;upported by hunger and thir&s;t.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall leave tho&s;e laws which the prudence of our
forefathers has e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ecurity of property&mdash;which are,
in this country, a monument of &s;ober reflection, &s;ound wi&s;dom, and
&s;olid judg|ment; which are, at this moment, di&s;pen&s;ed by men of brilliant
talents, correct information, and invincible integrity, and which are only
inconve|nient becau&s;e they are abu&s;ed, inefficient becau&s;e their
e&s;&s;ence is perverted, and oppre&s;&s;ive becau&s;e they are held out as
&s;nares for the good and the wor|thy, by the wicked and the
worthle&s;s&mdash;and &s;peak of tho&s;e other laws which civilization has
e&s;tabli&s;hed <PB N="iii" REF="8"> for the &s;ecurity of fame, and which,
being of a wider extent, and without &s;o decided a criterion, are productive
of much more &s;portive mi&s;chief than the others; both becau&s;e the
&s;cribbling pettifoggers have warmer imaginations than the legal ones, and
becau&s;e their nefarious freaks, though full as ra&s;|cally, may be
exerci&s;ed with impunity.</P>
<P>According to this, illicit lawyers&mdash;for I really ought to
make this di&s;tinction&mdash;&s;o they po&s;&s;e&s;s a plentiful &s;tock of
cunning and craft, need not be overburdened with intellects; but this is not
the ca&s;e with the other cla&s;s. Illicit writers cannot combat opinions
without &s;ome &s;tock of general in|formation; their competitors being men of
abili|ties: and thus it happens, that as you may call a lawyer a dunce and
welcome, &s;o you do not call him a rogue, &s;o you may call a &s;cribbler a
rogue and welcome, &s;o you do not call him a dunce: which is like Foote's
&s;troke at a &s;ociety who &s;ometime ago &s;et them&s;elves up as reformers,
under the appellation of The Chri&s;tian Club.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="9"> Having talked of hanging, and being told that
&s;uch an in&s;inuation would give offence, for that a brother of one of the
members had been hanged, he changes his ground, and talks of damning.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'That is right,' &s;ays the other, 'damn as much
as you plea&s;e; for though the Chri&s;tian club may have &s;ome fears of the
gallows, they do not value damnation of a bra&s;s farthing!'</Q></P>
<P>The truth of this di&s;tinction which I have made will, I think,
be pretty clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a con&s;ideration that the traffic of the
lawyers depends on certain things called goods, chattles, hou&s;es,
hereditaments&mdash;in &s;hort any thing that can be con|veyed&mdash;whereas
the &s;cribblers cannot always convey the object of their traffic, even in
idea. A lam|poon is not attachable; or, if it were, it would be of no value.
There is nothing tangible in a modern Pindaric ode; or, if there were, as
Shake&s;peare has it, 
<Q REND="inline">'Tho&s;e that touch pitch will be defiled.'</Q>
Nor can poor Pri&s;cian bring his action of battery, though we &s;ee his head
broken every day.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="10"> Thus, while they &s;teer clear of hitting the
man, they may di&s;charge whole vollies of their pointle&s;s arrows at the
writer with &s;afety. He has no objection to their picking up their crumbs at
his expence. The &s;un nurtures myriads of in&s;ects, that at once inhale
poi&s;on and pre&s;ervation from his genial influence.</P>
<P>As I certainly allude to the abu&s;e with which, in my life, I
have been &s;o foully be&s;pattered, it &s;hould &s;eem as if I had drawn this
conclu&s;ion with a view to announce my&s;elf a man of genius. Were I &s;o
weak, I &s;hould be in a lamentable error indeed. For an author, with the
&s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to fame, I ought by this time to have been abu&s;ed
ten times more than I have; unle&s;s indeed I rate the quality of the abu&s;e
in addition to the quantity, and &s;o, by throwing one lump of invidious
ra&s;cality into the &s;cale, make it preponderate in my fa|vour.</P>
<P>I am afraid however I am not &s;o lucky; for, in this ca&s;e, I
mu&s;t take in the idea that the &s;lander <PB N="vi" REF="11"> of a rogue is a
compliment to an hone&s;t man: and I have already &s;aid, that every thing
beyond literary defamation is here out of the que&s;tion. I have therefore
nothing left for it but a comparative view of that abu&s;e which has been
levelled at others and my&s;elf, and, upon that enumeration, I &s;hall be
driven to e&s;timate my own labours at that humble rate which the public will
always give its due prai&s;e, but which a&s;pires at nothing more.</P>
<P>To begin with the ancients. Has any writer &s;u&s;tained more rank
and foul abu&s;e than Homer? who, after all, is &s;o ju&s;tly &s;tyled the
father of poetry: and if they began with the father, no wonder they have &s;o
completely gone through all the family.&mdash;It has been &s;aid that the
mu&s;es them&s;elves &s;et him up a rival in He&s;iod, whom they invited to
re&s;ide with them on Mount Helicon, and, that they might initiate him into all
their my&s;teries, actually took him into their &s;ervice, and endowed him with
their own cele&s;tial genius. Tutored thus by his heavenly
in&s;tructre&s;&s;es, he is &s;aid to have won a tripod from Homer at a
poetical controver&s;y at Chalcis; but <PB N="vii" REF="12"> Alexander laughs
at this bu&s;ine&s;s, con&s;truing it into a compliment to Homer, and &s;aying
that He&s;iod might well win a prize from Homer, when not kings, but pea&s;ants
were the judges.</P>
<P>When you come to Virgil, the&s;e candid re|porters allow nothing
more than that he was the tran&s;lator and imitator of Homer; to prove which,
they in&s;tance his &s;ending Aeneas to hell, in po&s;itive imitation of the
Ody&s;&s;ey, the conver&s;ation of the gods, the games, the &s;hips, and many
other things. But what &s;ort of an imitator of Homer mu&s;t he have been if it
be true, as Le Mercier informs us, that Homer wrote neither the Iliad nor the
Ody&s;&s;ey!&mdash;but that they were compiled from the works of all the
eminent writers of that time; impre&s;&s;ing very &s;trongly an idea that Homer
was merely a ballad &s;inger, and that he invented nothing, but only
pro|mulgated the Grub-&s;treet doctrine of Greece.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o that Virgil imitated He&s;iod in his georgics,
and Theocritus in his pa&s;torals. Ter|rence too is &s;aid to have been no more
than the <PB N="viii" REF="13"> tran&s;lator of Plautus, Livy the imitator of
Hero|dotus, and Sallu&s;t of Thucidides, who had before been imitated in his
writings&mdash;which, after all, were ob&s;cure&mdash;by Zenephon, and in his
orations by Demo&s;thenes. Horace, they report, &s;tole his art of poetry from
Ari&s;totle's rhetoric; and, as to Ari&s;totle him&s;elf, &s;ome have gone &s;o
far as to que&s;|tion whether we have any thing genuine of his at all, and they
offer the following circum&s;tance as a notable proof of this vague and
&s;trange opinion.</P>
<P>Theophra&s;tus received, as a legacy, the writ|ings of
Ari&s;totle. The heirs of Theophra&s;tus bu|ried them in the ground, at
Scep&s;is, a town of Troas, to hide them from King Pergamus. Here they lay
concealed a hundred and &s;ixty years, and were, at the end of that time,
&s;old to one Appelli|con, a rich citizen of Athens. They fell afterwards into
the hands of Sylla; after that they were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by Tyrannian, a
grammarian; and next they became the property of Andronicus, of Rhodes, who
fir&s;t made them public about two hundred and fifty years after the death of
Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="14"> Thus, we have a Virgil who imitated a Homer,
who never was a writer!&mdash;and we have a Horace who &s;tole from the works
of an Ari&s;totle, which works it is in&s;inuated are &s;purious! But neither
is Zoilus him&s;elf, of Philadelphus, nor Le Mercier, the Zoilus of France, to
be put in the &s;malle&s;t com|petition with Father Ardouine, who, determined
to put the matter out of doubt, roundly a&s;&s;erts, upon his own &s;ingle
authority, that Homer, Virgil, and Horace were all forged by monks, in the
twelfth century!! Perhaps it was upon &s;ome occa&s;ion like this that Pa&s;cal
&s;aid it was ea&s;ier to find monks than rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Thus go on the&s;e Ari&s;tarchu&s;es in critici&s;m. The defenders
of Virgil, a&s;&s;uming great candour, tell us that they &s;ub&s;cribe to
tho&s;e charges brought again&s;t him, above mentioned, but that he cer|tainly
excelled He&s;iod. Ju&s;tice however obliges them to confe&s;s that he fell
&s;hort of Theocritus in the &s;ame proportion as the Latin is inferior to the
Greek. They confe&s;s too that he &s;tole from Lu|cretius; but this, they add,
was a proof of his e&s;|teem <PB N="x" REF="15"> for him. They then candidly
hint that it was little better than receiving &s;tolen goods, for that
Lucretius him&s;elf is &s;u&s;pected of having taken &s;ome of his works from
Empedocles and others, and yet, in the &s;ame breath, they &s;ay that Lucretius
ranks before all other Latin authors. They defend Vir|gil from a charge that
Lucan was a greater poet, combating the opinions of Hein&s;ius, Corneille,
Heron, and Fielding, who all give the palm to Lu|can; but, to make this defence
as left-handed as po&s;&s;ible, they allow that the Phar&s;alia is more
com|plete than the Aeneid, becau&s;e there is a fault in the chronology; which
anacroni&s;m, however, to glo&s;s over, they in&s;i&s;t that Virgil intended it
as a beauty, and then follow up this cold compliment by &s;aying that Lucan,
though an original, was an original of no value. The deduction therefore is,
that it is doubtful whether Virgil was not a wor&s;e poet than Lucan, who,
after all, has no great merit him&s;elf. But a modern critic has gone a great
deal beyond this; a&s;&s;erting, that though the whole re|putation of Virgil
&s;tands upon three &s;pecimens of imitation, though he has no invention, no
origina|lity, <PB N="xi" REF="16"> no creation, yet he de&s;erves all his
fame:&mdash;and how does he make this out? Why, truly, by attributing this fame
to his &s;tyle, which he calls the 
<Q REND="inline">'pickle that has pre&s;erved his mummy from
cor|ruption.'</Q></P>
<P>Were I to advert to the long catalogue of op|po&s;ite opinions
which will very ea&s;ily occur to any man of reading, who has a faithful and
retentive memory, it would be an intru&s;ion on the patience of every
intelligent reader. I have in&s;tanced abun|dantly enough to prove that
cavillers find it difficult to convince; that Envy beholds pigmy
imperfec|tions, and neglects giant beauties; and that fools, in &s;earch of
defects and contradictions, deprive them&s;elves of that plea&s;ure and
improvement with which heaven permits men of &s;uperior talents to adorn the
world.</P>
<P>It is with me a matter of infinite concern, that if candour be the
criterion of genius, the ancients po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more genius than the
moderns. When Euripides died, Sophocles went into mourning; 
<PB N="xii" REF="17"> and yet, to prove that Sophocles was fond of ap|plau&s;e,
he died with joy at the &s;ucce&s;s of one of his own tragedies. What can be
more noble than the declaration of Theodore Gaza, that if all the works then
extant were to be thrown into the &s;ea, the la&s;t that would merit &s;uch a
fate would be the works of Plutarch! Or the forbearance of Zenophon, who might
have had the writings of Thucidides attributed to him, but he di&s;dained
it!</P>
<P>If the cotemporaries of Terence acknowledge that he has imitated
Plautus, they never fail to add that it was making gold out of dro&s;s. By one
it was &s;aid, that the very pro&s;titutes of Terence &s;peak with more
mode&s;ty than the hone&s;t women of Plau|tus. Cicero, &s;peaking of the purity
of Terence, calls him the regulator of the Latin tongue. Alex|ander, when he
&s;acked Thebes, &s;pared the hou&s;e and po&s;terity of Pindar. Plato was
called the di|vine. Zenophon, from his &s;weetne&s;s and beauty, is called the
bee, and the attic mu&s;e. His works are &s;aid to have in&s;pired Scipio, the
African, and <PB N="xiii" REF="18"> Lucullus, in like manner as tho&s;e of
Homer fired the mind of Alexander.</P>
<P>When do we hear, in the&s;e times, &s;uch warmth and candour as
that of Appolonius Molus? who, on hearing Cicero harrangue, exclaimed&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'Poor Greece! Now thou art utterly
undone!&mdash;The Romans had before conquered thee in arms: now they have
conquered thee in eloquence!'</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e few in&s;tances, among many that occur to me, prove that
the ancients po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every merit that has been attributed to them,
and &s;hew that the greate&s;t effort of the human mind is to ri&s;e
&s;u|perior to envy.</P>
<P>The influence of this fiend, however, lay only dormant till the
ine&s;timable works of the&s;e great men were univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed. The
moment that opportunity occurred, &s;he &s;hook off her torpor, awoke, walked
abroad, and looked &s;o terrible, that mode&s;t rea&s;on &s;ighed, blu&s;hed,
and retired.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="19"> To be plain. It is remarkable that the more
modern we get, the more the number of cavillers increa&s;es; and, really, as
cavilling is a very un|gracious thing, this is lucky for them; both be|cau&s;e
the ta&s;k becomes every day more and more difficult, and becau&s;e the dunces
become every day more and more &s;tupid. Thus the labour, by being given into
&s;o many hands, is infinitely le&s;s tre|mendous.</P>
<P>The quantum of abu&s;e mu&s;t be always the &s;ame, and how hard
it is to fall to the lot of one man, wholly to employ him&s;elf in &s;earching
out the faults of his neighbour, when, by an hone&s;t appro|priation of his
time, he might manife&s;t &s;ome per|fection of his own. This feat of
hardihood, how|ever, we &s;ee Milbourn, almo&s;t &s;ingle-handed, at|tempt
again&s;t Dryden, though the portion of abu&s;e is as great, and the quality as
malevolent, as all that va&s;t cargo of Grub-&s;treet filth with which Pope was
be&s;pattered, by all the heroes immortalized in the Dunciad; and, if we want a
climax, we have no|thing to do but look at that flock of critical crows 
<PB N="xv" REF="20"> who, even yet, have not left off gorging on the li|terary
carca&s;e of Doctor John&s;on.</P>
<P>But, if I were to go into that large field of ob|&s;ervation which
it would be nece&s;&s;ary to traver&s;e to get at the divers &s;chi&s;ms that
have, at times, di&s;|tracted the &s;tate of literature, I &s;hould make it the
field of battle between the moderns and the ancients. In France I &s;hould
&s;et Corneille and Racine again&s;t Sophocles and Euripides; Malherbe
again&s;t Pin|dar; Moliere again&s;t Menander and Ari&s;tophanes, nay Plautus
and Terence. The Counte&s;s De la Su&s;e and Madame Dacier would pull caps with
Sapho. In Italy, Petrarch and Guarini would at|tack Ovid and Tibullus;
Ta&s;&s;o would menace to their teeth Homer and Virgil; Camoes, Lopez de Vega,
Calderone, and Cervantes, would &s;ingle out their re&s;pective antagoni&s;ts,
for the honour of Spain and Portugal; and I &s;hould involve literature in that
chaos of prejudices and opinions, from which men of the be&s;t learning find it
&s;o extremely diffi|cult to &s;eparate its con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="21"> Did I extend the &s;cene to England,
in&s;tead of the preface to a work, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make this a work
of it&s;elf. So many, &s;o extraordinary, &s;o vague, &s;o diver&s;ified have
been the real or affected opinions in this country, as to what con&s;titutes
the e&s;&s;ence of literary perfection, that you have only to tran&s;mute them,
as you ring changes upon bells, and every Engli&s;h writer, at different times,
has, and has not, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore, by way of corroborating my a&s;&s;ertion,
that no man is entitled to any large por|tion of literary fame till he has been
hand&s;omely abu&s;ed, only in&s;tance &s;ome of that prodigious load of foul
and &s;landerous filth which&mdash;as good &s;ome|times grows out of
evil&mdash;procured the world tho&s;e two monuments of genius and ju&s;tice,
Mac Flecnoe, and the Dunciad; and I the more readily do this, to &s;hew that
one &s;pecimen is as good as a thou&s;and: becau&s;e, were I to produce a
thou&s;and, nothing could be &s;aid in them but what is already &s;aid here;
nay, nor even in one of the&s;e that is not &s;aid in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="22"> Milbourn, as I before mentioned, is the
au|thor of nearly all the calumny again&s;t Dryden.&mdash;Pope's calumniators
are Dennis, Theobald, Old|mixon, and a variety of others, who, one &s;hould
think, were more than adequate to the ta&s;k; for they had nothing to do but
copy what had been written before. Dryden, upon this &s;ingle, and Pope, upon
this complicate authority, are every thing that can be &s;aid of the wor&s;t
men and the wor&s;t writers.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden is a mere renegado from monarchy, poetry,

<Q REND="inline">'Pope is an open enemy to his country and the

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Dryden looks upon God's go&s;pel as a fooli&s;h
fable, like the pope, to whom he is a pitiful pur|veyor. His very
chri&s;tianity may be que&s;tioned. He ought to expect more &s;everity than

My calumniators have gone but a very little way indeed towards a&s;certaining
my merit by this criterion. I beg therefore they will be&s;tir them&s;elves;
and as, in this novel, I have given them new opportunity&mdash;e&s;pecially as
they may find in it a mirror that will <PB N="xxiii" REF="28"> reflect &s;ome
of their own faces&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure them they cannot afford me a more

<P>Having indubitably proved that it is my inte|re&s;t to be

enmity, confer kind|ne&s;s, &s;hew in what way it may be&s;t, or rather mo&s;t
expediently, be done.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I would have them keep no &s;ort of mea|&s;ures, but
indulge their rancour as much as po&s;&s;ible. Let their method be to hold
&s;uch trifles as proba|bility, propriety, and decency in contempt; to u&s;e
perpetually epithets which are appropriate to rage, di&s;appointment, and
vexation, to enforce terms that imply candour, ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and
liberality.&mdash;Thus, in proportion as they are bur&s;ting with envy, &s;o,
at lea&s;t in their own opinions, they will conceal it: like the &s;illy bird,
that thru&s;ts its head into a hedge, to hide its body from its pur&s;uers.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="29"> If they would detect non&s;en&s;e, I would

what in reality is incomprehen|&s;ible.</P>
<P>I would have all their outworks of critici&s;m fortified with
threats, denunciations, and menaces. I would have the&s;e &s;upported by
impudence, arro|gance, and cruelty. I would have them place about fa&s;cines of
hints, in&s;inuations, and conjectures; and when, by a powerful on&s;et of
truth and conviction, they were driven from the&s;e, I would have them take
&s;helter in their &s;trong hold of <HI>ip&s;e dixit;</HI> that anticipater of

dignify &s;acri|lege, profane the throne, and defy heaven!</P>
<P>Let them utter <HI>ip&s;e dixits</HI> then like &s;o many fiats,
but never let them pre&s;ume to argue; le&s;t, de|tected by ignorance,
for&s;aken by truth, and ex|po&s;ed to &s;corn, they betray frontle&s;s
impudence and &s;cowling envy, hidden by a filmy veil of candour.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;ubjects however with which I would not
advi&s;e them to tamper. In particular, let them not ri&s;k the awkward
predicament in which they would &s;tand if they were hardy enough to cen|&s;ure
the public for the warm and liberal reception afforded to my labours. Let them
not venture to &s;lander tho&s;e men of worth and honour who ap|prove in me, in
oppo&s;ition to them, a life of regu|larity, &s;obriety, and indu&s;try: and,
above all, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for human invention&mdash;not even their
in|vention&mdash;to <PB N="xxvi" REF="31"> give any other motive to the
honourable and generous &s;upport by which I have the happine&s;s to be

attempt|ing to de&s;cribe it, &s;cowl, bite their malignant quills, gna&s;h
their teeth, and hang their recreant heads in &s;ullenne&s;s and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>With the&s;e in&s;tructions, I think they can hardly mi&s;s their
way. If there &s;hould be any danger of it&mdash;as it would be a pity that
&s;uch charitable inten|tions &s;hould reap nothing but &s;hame and
confu&s;ion&mdash;by way of con&s;ummating their noble and manly purpo&s;e, let
them boldly a&s;&s;ert that I have written none of this book. Let them be &s;o
ungratefully &s;e|vere as to &s;ay it is not I who have given them this
friendly advice, but &s;ome outca&s;t from &s;ociety; and, as novelty in
&s;lander is as catching as in any thing el&s;e&mdash;having gone every other
length&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e this time, by way of variety, it were to be attributed
to &s;ome murderer. I think, as Mr. Bayes has it, the circum&s;tance would
elevate and &s;urpri&s;e. But this, <PB N="xxvii" REF="32"> after all, I leave
to them&s;elves; for it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be an adept in an employ
the motives of which I &s;corn, and the malignity of which I dete&s;t.</P>
<P>If, by officiou&s;ly pointing out their readie&s;t road, it
&s;hould appear to them that I have, by anticipa|tion, betrayed the cloven
foot, and they &s;hould be therefore induced to forego their intentions, from
an apprehen&s;ion of detection&mdash;for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins are always
cowards&mdash;let it be remembered that I &s;hall &s;et it down for a &s;ulky
perver&s;ene&s;s; and, even though no &s;ingle word of abu&s;e &s;hall be
breathed again&s;t me, I &s;hall take very comfortably to my&s;elf the &s;ame

and &s;et it down, with all the compo&s;ure in the world, as a large figure to

nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the fame of a writer, and which, upon that ground
of argu|ment, I am &s;o ambitious to merit.</P>
<P>Having gone through the painful part of my duty&mdash;for there is
nothing &s;o painful as that which <PB N="xxviii" REF="33"> is unavailing, and
there is nothing &s;o unavailing as giving advice to the incorrigible&mdash;a
few words will bring me to the end of this preface. A few very plea&s;ing
words! They are the&s;e: that in this, as in every other in&s;tance where I

uglie&s;t form and filthie&s;t colours; having hunted craft and art to the
toils; having invited the broad laugh again&s;t vain and in&s;uperable folly;
having ex|cited the admiration, and commended the practice, of virtue and
honour, I fearle&s;sly tru&s;t my book to its fortune, &s;afe in the
critici&s;m of the candid, and &s;ecure in the indulgence of the liberal; for
the moral I inculcate is the folly of wickedne&s;s, and the wi&s;|dom of
rectitude: a doctrine which &s;hews, that while irritated vice multiplies
deformity, by break|ing the mirror of nature, it remains entire and un|fullied
to the eye of virtue, that con&s;ciou&s;ly reflects its own un&s;potted
loveline&s;s.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>SHEWS UPON WHAT GROUNDS THE AUTHOR FOUNDS HIS PRE|TENSIONS TO
THE READER'S INDULGENCE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As it very often happens that readers get half through a work
without knowing its drift&mdash;not un|frequently becau&s;e the author does not
know it him|&s;elf&mdash;I hold it nece&s;&s;ary to preclude all
po&s;&s;ibility of any &s;uch thing in the peru&s;al of this work, by
premi&s;ing what, according to my conception, ought to be the tendency of
productions &s;imilar to this, and what I here mean to inculcate in
particular.</P>
<P>A novel, as the word is now under&s;tood and e&s;tabli&s;hed, is
a general title for any work which <PB N="2" REF="35"> &s;prings &s;olely from
the imagination, yet &s;o deline|ates men and manners as to place all its
events within view of probability. It is a kind of mean betwixt hi&s;tory,
which records mere fact, and ro|mance, which holds out acknowledged
fiction.</P>
<P>As, however, plea&s;ure and in&s;truction are the only end that
any admitted exerci&s;e of the imagination can propo&s;e, the&s;e all labour,
with different materials, to produce the &s;ame effect. Hi&s;tory not only
teaches mankind to &s;hun vice and imitate virtue, by in|&s;tancing tho&s;e
events which are mo&s;t condu&s;ive to &s;o laudable an end, but &s;hews the
propriety of the doctrine it enforces, by authenticating the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>The noveli&s;t, who is the biographer of an ima|ginary hero,
chu&s;es, for his &s;ource, manners in ge|neral. His margin cannot &s;well with
authorities, nor can he&mdash;by way of notes&mdash;cite the contrary opinions
of great men concerning the vices or vir|tues of tho&s;e characters he
celebrates. So they po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame qualities in common with the
re&s;t of mankind, and the events brought about by their means are &s;uch as
our ob&s;ervation points out to be natural, his ta&s;k is completely performed;
and he has a right to expect as much credit for relating circum&s;tances that
might have happened, as he <PB N="3" REF="36"> who&mdash;as far as he can clear
his narrative from the cobwebs of tradition, and di&s;entangle it from the
labyrinth of contradictory authority&mdash;records facts that did happen.</P>
<P>Romances are, figuratively, in nature; and, lite|rally,
fictitious. They are intended, by lifting the mind above probability, to
enforce moral by figure and allegory: and they attain their end&mdash;and
indeed laudably&mdash;for they rou&s;e tho&s;e torpid minds into action which
cannot reli&s;h writings that are kept within the bounds of &s;imple
nature.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of compo&s;ition is remarkably grati|fying to
weak minds. It is&mdash;if I may be permitted &s;o to expre&s;s
my&s;elf&mdash;an honourable fraud; for, exaggerate the beauty of virtue how
you can, it will &s;till be lovely; whereas vice, being ugly in it&s;elf,
becomes more hideous when it is carica|tured.</P>
<P>The&s;e three different vehicles for the conveyance of truth and
morality, &s;eem to require different conductors; and indeed it has &s;eldom
happened that any one man has equally &s;ucceeded in them.&mdash;Romance
&s;eems to require a poetic &s;oul: &s;trong in conception, fertile in
invention, and various in ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Hi&s;tory wants nothing but a
per&s;picuous <PB N="4" REF="37"> &s;tyle, authentic information, and
invincible vera|city.</P>
<P>He who writes novels mu&s;t partake of all the&s;e qualities. He
mu&s;t unite in his imagination the glow of poetry with the &s;teadine&s;s of
narrative.&mdash;The latter mu&s;t be as a curb to the former: not, however, to
damp its &s;pirit, but to prevent it from running away:&mdash;like the
alderman, who, at a lord mayor's fea&s;t, would have made him&s;elf &s;ick if
his phy&s;ician had not &s;at by the &s;ide of him.</P>
<P>Thus I think it becomes pretty evident that novel writing holds
a very re&s;pectable &s;tand in literature, and I &s;incerely believe that men
of con&s;iderable ta|lents would very often practi&s;e it, were it not for
tho&s;e &s;purious productions with which the pre&s;s teems under the
appellation of novels, which means any love &s;tory calculated to madden the
minds of &s;entimental country ladies, to trouble the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of
old gentlemen who marry young girls, and to overturn the purity imbibed at
boarding &s;chools.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ure to make their way into all the cir|culating
libraries in the kingdom, provided they are &s;ufficiently &s;tuffed with dying
lovers, inexorable parents, and impertinent chambermaids; with the 
<PB N="5" REF="38"> addition of three or four elopements, half a dozen duels,
and an attempt or two at a rape; to which may be added, a little &s;uicide, or
a &s;mattering of ince&s;t&mdash;e&s;pecially if it be written by a
lady&mdash;by way of ze&s;t, to make it go down the more glib.</P>
<P>Being about to give a novel to the world, I thought it incumbent
on me to &s;ay thus much; from which the reader will naturally conclude that I
intend, throughout this work, to keep nature and proba|bility in &s;ight, to
reject that which is frivolous and impertinent, and to adopt only what, by
means of amu&s;ement, may bring about in&s;truction.</P>
<P>It will neverthele&s;s be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay further, that,
in portraying nature, I &s;hall make her neither a flattering likene&s;s, nor a
caricature. Nor is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary; for, let her &s;it for her picture ever
&s;o often, &s;he never will exhibit the &s;ame face twice, yet &s;hall the
general re&s;emblance always be &s;triking; for it has been well ob&s;erved,
that &s;he takes every various hue of the camelion, yet, torture her how you
will, her form is as con&s;tant as the polypus. No two hu|man faces, though
compo&s;ed of the &s;ame features, ever were known to be correctly alike, and
the lu|minous mind of LAVATER, did he attempt the ar|duous and ab&s;urd ta&s;k
of &s;earching for any &s;uch would exactly re&s;emble the lanthorn of
AESOP.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="39"> To the&s;e general remarks&mdash;which I
conceived it expedient to place here&mdash;I &s;hall add particular ones
whenever they appear to be nece&s;&s;ary, and now I invite the reader to the
examination of a faithful, though a bold, repre&s;entation of human life, for I
declare upon my word as a man, there is not a cha|racter or circum&s;tance in
this whole work which I do not experimentally know from a clo&s;e
ob&s;erva|tion and mankind, to have virtual exi&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION&mdash;TWO HOUSES&mdash;A
CITIZEN&mdash;AND A REFLECTION UPON DEATH.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A BRIDGE thrown over the high road, at the en|trance of a
village in Warwick&s;hire, called Ca&s;tle|wick, is the &s;eparation of two
e&s;tates, one of which had been, at the period this hi&s;tory commences, for
half a century in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family of Ha|zard, and the
other, for almo&s;t treble that &s;pace, in the family of Roebuck.</P>
<P>Nature had been equally bountiful in the di&s;tribu|tion of her
favours on either &s;ide of the road, which fortuitous advantage art had been
indu&s;triou&s;ly called in to improve. If a neat hamlet and a white &s;pire
gave a more modern termination to the view, through a group of pines and
cedars, from Hazard lawn; an old market town and a contiguous moul|dering
ca&s;tle became vi&s;ible, through an avenue of elms, from Roebuck park.</P>
<P>Every Chine&s;e temple, urn, or &s;tatue, on one &s;ide, erected
to fancy, con&s;ecrated to friend&s;hip, or dedicated to the arts, had, on the
other, its rival <PB N="8" REF="41"> grotto, cavern, or hermitage. Here was
&s;een a clump of elms, there a row of oaks; while the me|andering
avon&mdash;le&s;t the lord of one man&s;ion &s;hould be jealous of its favours
lavi&s;hed on the other&mdash;not only by the advantage of a di&s;tant height,
plunged up a rocky cliff to delight one favourite with the awful concu&s;&s;ion
of a beautiful ca&s;cade, which fall|ing, le&s;&s;ened into a gurgling rivulet;
but, al&s;o, opening its &s;mooth, capacious bo&s;om, moved on in maje&s;tic
&s;ilence, through the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the other; &s;tretching out on
one &s;ide a &s;mall, irregular &s;tream, which &s;upplied the hou&s;e, watered
the gar|den, and turned the village mill.</P>
<P>Old Ru&s;t, the grandfather of Lord Hazard, was a &s;kinner in
the city. His profe&s;&s;ion unluckily made him rather a bye-word; for he had
&s;uch a vo|racious thir&s;t, or hunger, after money&mdash;for gold can be both
eaten and drank&mdash;that it was archly &s;aid he would &s;kin any thing for
profit. Nay, &s;ome are of opinion that, from this very remark, originated the
epithet &s;kinflint. Be that as it may, he cer|tainly ama&s;&s;ed a very large
fortune, and having run through the regular progre&s;&s;ion of livery-man,
common council-man, deputy, alderman, &s;heriff, and lord mayor, he married in
his &s;eventy-fir&s;t year, a girl of &s;ixteen, without a &s;ixpence, who bore
him&mdash;or &s;omebody el&s;e&mdash;a &s;on, portioned three of 
<PB N="9" REF="42"> her &s;i&s;ters, granted a pen&s;ion to an Iri&s;h
relation, &s;et up a coach, and bought a villa; till at length, having
expo&s;tulated, &s;tormed, threatened, prayed, and entreated, to no purpo&s;e,
poor Ru&s;t&mdash;think of it with horror ye antiquated Adonises&mdash;died
raving mad in St. Luke's ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Previous to his in&s;anity, however, he took care to make a
will, ve&s;ting his whole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the hands of tru&s;tees, for
the u&s;e of his &s;on. His re|mains were, therefore, &s;carcely laid in the
earth, when the widow, with a moderate annuity, was obliged to &s;ink into
retirement; and of her it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more than that
&s;he died when her &s;on, who was purpo&s;ely kept from her by his guardians,
came to be eighteen years old.</P>
<P>Young Ru&s;t, be&s;ides the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of uncommon
talents, was wonderfully calculated for commerce. Before he was thirty he
con&s;iderably augmented his decea&s;ed father's wealth; and, a few years
after|wards&mdash;having bought a large e&s;tate which gave him the entire
nomination of four members of par|liament&mdash;he became &s;o material an
object to the mini&s;ter, that he was made one of tho&s;e peers which it was
then expedient to create, le&s;t the balance of power in the con&s;titution
&s;hould be found to lean too much to the &s;ide of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="43"> No longer Mr. Ru&s;t, then, but Baron
Hazard, he pulled down the old man&s;ion on the e&s;tate he had purcha&s;ed,
and built that very chateau we have al|ready commemorated. As he had a towering
am|bition, he now married into an honourable family, not overburdened with
riches; was &s;hortly ble&s;t with &s;everal children; and had made &s;ome
rapid &s;trides towards an improvement in both church and &s;tate;
but&mdash;&s;o tran&s;itory is the felicity of lords, as well as inferior
beings&mdash;he did not live long to en|joy that &s;ucce&s;s his hopes &s;eemed
to promi&s;e:&mdash;for, &s;itting up a whole night to compo&s;e a &s;peech,
which was to have introduced a plan to de&s;troy pluralities, and root out
corruption, he caught a cold, which being followed by a fever, he was hurried
out of the world, having &s;carcely time to &s;ettle his affairs.</P>
<P>The young lord&mdash;but here, kind reader, let us both give a
&s;igh to the memory of Lord Hazard, and admire that the wi&s;e&s;t de&s;igns
in this &s;ublunary exi&s;tence are liable, like a grain of &s;and, to be

terror of the neighbourhood. It is true he was a little checked in his wild
career by the wi&s;e and whole&s;ome coun&s;els of his mother, to which he at
fir&s;t affected to li&s;ten; but, becoming more and more hardened, her
precepts and conduct were al|together di&s;regarded; till at length, worn out
with preaching to no purpo&s;e, &s;he retired into the bo&s;om of her own
family, with a firm determination to con&s;ider her&s;elf entirely alienated
from her di&s;gra|cious &s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="45"> Lord Hazard being now left to the unbridled
in|fluence of his head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, &s;topt at nothing to gratify
them. The farmers' wives and daughters, if they had the &s;malle&s;t
preten&s;ions to beauty, were &s;ure to become objects fir&s;t of his
genero&s;ity, then his gratification, and afterwards his neglect: or, if they
dur&s;t di&s;pute his impetuous wi&s;hes, his un|alterable re&s;entment. But,
as the &s;wifte&s;t cannon ball, which neither edifices of wood nor &s;tone can
oppo&s;e, may be &s;topt in its very &s;tronge&s;t velocity by the dull
re&s;i&s;tance of a wool pack, &s;o were the vehement pur&s;uits of Lord Hazard
effectually checked by that dulle&s;t of all dull things, accord|ing to the
bachelors&mdash;ay, and many of the married men too&mdash;a wife.</P>
<P>My lord's tutor, who&s;e name was Viney, and who, as I hinted
before, had the highe&s;t a&s;cendancy over his pupil&mdash;having ever been
cnofiderably more u&s;eful to him in the conduct of his love affairs than in
his &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics&mdash;had al&s;o another pupil. Indeed his
attention to this la&s;t mentioned &s;cholar, on whom he had expended a large
part of that money which the bounty to Lord Hazard&mdash;for his lord&s;hip was
liberal to exce&s;s&mdash;had lavi&s;hed on him, would appear very enigmatical
did we not derive it from its natural motive.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="46"> This &s;cholar then was no other than his
&s;i&s;ter, who, without a penny, had married an Iri&s;h for|tune hunter, and
was very &s;hortly &s;aved the trouble of breaking his heart by a kind friend
of his, who killed him in a duel. Viney had connived at this marriage, which,
&s;oon after it was con&s;ummated, was found to be a mutual bite. However, as
his &s;i&s;ter was left a blooming widow of twenty-two, he ea&s;ily comforted
him&s;elf by con&s;idering her market as not yet over. In a word, he had long
in idea married her to Lord Hazard. This will account for his genero&s;ity:
nor, when it is con&s;idered how completely this &s;ame Mr. Viney ruled his
pupil, will it appear very unaccountable that the lady &s;hould become at
length in reality what &s;he had long been in imagination.</P>
<P>Marriage &s;topt for a while the exce&s;&s;es of Lord Hazard. He
doated on his wife; and, having taken this &s;tep, Viney became his privy
coun&s;ellor in a &s;tronger degree than ever. His tone, however, was &s;oon
changed. He found her a mixture of arro|gance, meanne&s;s, bridled
wantonne&s;s, and ignorant affectation. Nor is it difficult to divine where it
might have ended if he had not accidentally di&s;co|vered, after having been
about three months ble&s;&s;ed with an heir, that &s;he had an intrigue with
his valet de chamber.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="47">
<P>This rou&s;ed him at once. She was properly de|tected, the
nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps were taken, and a divorce obtained. She recriminated,
indeed, but he was a lord, and his &s;ucce&s;s certain. Thus, having re|ceived
&s;atisfaction for the injuries he had &s;u&s;tained, he legally bani&s;hed her
for ever from his pre&s;ence, granting her only a decent provi&s;ion for
life.</P>
<P>Any one experienced in the human heart will ea&s;ily &s;ee the
part Viney took upon his &s;i&s;ter's de|tection. He exclaimed again&s;t her
with the great|e&s;t violence, and was the forwarde&s;t in procuring his
lord&s;hip that redre&s;s which he knew it was not in his power to prevent.</P>
<P>This conduct e&s;tabli&s;hed him more firmly than ever in the
good graces and hou&s;ehold of Lord Ha|zard; the fir&s;t of which advantages he
often de|clared&mdash;loudly to the world&mdash;was the ultimate end of all his
wi&s;hes; becau&s;e, &s;aid he&mdash;&s;oftly to him|&s;elf&mdash;it brings
about the other.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn that marriage proved a pret|ty tight curb
to the exce&s;&s;es of this young noble|man, and one would think his divorce
had given him a rea&s;onable &s;urfeit of marriage; but, I know not how it is,
&s;ome men &s;eem to be the bubble of their own arts: their whole &s;tudy is to
overreach <PB N="15" REF="48"> them&s;elves, and if they &s;tumble on tolerable
con|tent, it is becau&s;e things take a different turn from what they
de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Thus it happened with our peer. Every re&s;olu|tion he took, in
con&s;equence of being a widower, was wrong; and yet he hit upon happine&s;s
when he only meant revenge.</P>
<P>This was his argument. He had married a wo|man of &s;pirit, who
had injured him in the &s;tronge&s;t degree, and, for this indignity, he was
determined to take vengeance on her whole &s;ex; idly forgetting that this was
revenging him&s;elf on a whole hive, for the &s;ting of a &s;ingle bee.
Be&s;ides, he him&s;elf was to blame: the fault lay in his own want of
di&s;cern|ment. Had he fairly examined the ground of the bu&s;ine&s;s, he would
have plainly &s;een that it origi|nated with Viney, who had taught him nothing
but what di&s;graced his birth, and deprived him of the u&s;e of that valuable
goodne&s;s of heart which he re|ally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which, had he
fallen into proper hands, might have induced him to have di&s;pen&s;ed the
gifts of fortune nobly in&s;tead of licentiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>To put this worthy project in execution, Lord Hazard re&s;olved
once more to try the married &s;tate, re&s;olutely vowing to conduct him&s;elf
in &s;o authori|tative <PB N="16" REF="49"> a manner to his &s;econd wife, that
&s;he &s;hould not dare even to think without his previous permi&s;|&s;ion. He
had &s;carcely come to this re&s;olution, but his unea&s;ine&s;s on his late
di&s;grace vani&s;hed. He looked round for a wife with the greate&s;t
eagerne&s;s, till at length, with Viney's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who was &s;till
con&s;ulted, he thought he had found one to his wi&s;h.</P>
<P>But how was he a&s;toni&s;hed when he plainly &s;aw it would be
impo&s;&s;ible to avail him&s;elf of any one of tho&s;e prudent determinations,
tho&s;e ingenious precautions he had been &s;o long and &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly
arming him&s;elf with. He had now &s;uch a wife that to controul her was
impo&s;&s;ible; to advi&s;e her, u&s;e|le&s;s!</P>
<P>If my readers think he was again caught, after &s;o much wary
and cautious re&s;olution, after &s;uch an|ticipation of &s;ucce&s;s, I hope it
will be confe&s;&s;ed he de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>Certainly he was di&s;appointed, but in that &s;atis|factory way
that a man would be at finding a lawyer who, taking a brief, &s;hould refu&s;e
a fee. Lady Hazard could not be controuled, advi&s;ed, or en|treated; for &s;he
had &s;o high a &s;en&s;e of her duty, &s;uch equanimity of temper, and &s;uch
&s;weetne&s;s of <PB N="17" REF="50"> manners, that &s;he anticipated her
lord's very wi&s;hes. He had received her from her father, a wealthy country
neighbour, who wanted to aggrandize his family. The young lady, who had all her
life made it her &s;tudy to plea&s;e her father, found it no irk&s;ome ta&s;k
to watch and comply with the tempers of her hu&s;band:&mdash;&s;o true it is
that a dutiful daughter has gone a great way towards becoming a good wife.</P>
<P>If ever an extraordinary event new moulded a man's mind, this
unexpected merit in his wife had that effect on Lord Hazard. He &s;aw in an
in&s;tant that his whole life had been one delu&s;ion; that while he had
&s;ought for plea&s;ure, he had neglected happine&s;s; and, therefore,
re&s;olved doubly to cheri&s;h it, &s;ince it had complacently conde&s;cended
to come home to him.</P>
<P>Nobody had ever dared to tell him he was a dupe to Viney: he now
&s;aw it him&s;elf. He did not, how|ever, think proper to withdraw his
protection from him, but contented him&s;elf only with giving him a hand&s;ome
rectory, to which that worthy incumbent &s;hortly removed.</P>
<P>In about a twelvemonth after this &s;econd mar|riage&mdash;but
hold, all great events &s;hould be u&s;hered in with cautious preparation.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="51"> A watchmaker would have called the
circum|&s;tance I am about to celebrate the main &s;pring of this hi&s;tory; a
&s;ailor would have &s;aid it was its helm; and an alderman its marrow.</P>
<P>It is &s;omething, therefore, of material con&s;e|quence; and,
of cour&s;e, proper to be given in a new chapter, and with a particular
introduction:&mdash;all which ceremony, though it may be the limbs and outward

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH&mdash;FIRST ADJUSTING A VERY ABSTRUSE DOGMA IN
LI|TERATURE&mdash;INTRODUCES THE HERO TO THE READER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT falls out &s;ometimes at the theatre, that, at the very
moment the audience are &s;itting with expec|tation on its utmo&s;t &s;tretch,
an actor, with a woe-begone countenance, comes on the &s;tage to an|nounce the
indi&s;po&s;ition of the principal actre&s;s.</P>
<P>This once happened of De&s;demona; and, as there was no lady in
the company competent to the part but her who&s;e name was in the bills, a
gentleman undertook it at a very &s;hort warning. The &s;pec|tators were, as
u&s;ual, content per force; but, after waiting a con&s;iderable time, the
apologizer was a &s;econd time obliged to come on, who a&s;&s;ured the audience
the play would &s;oon begin, but at pre&s;ent De&s;demona was not &s;haved.</P>
<P>I hope it will not be thought, by mentioning this ca&s;e in
point, that I mean to introduce in a ludi|crous way, a matter of &s;uch eminent
importance as that I now take the liberty of pre&s;enting to the 
<PB N="20" REF="53"> reader's notice; but, my <HI>amour propre</HI> is wounded:
for being forced&mdash;at the very critical moment I con&s;idered my&s;elf
happy beyond all example in the mode of introducing my hero&mdash;to &s;topt
&s;hort, and put my readers in the exact &s;ituation of the &s;pecta|tors above
de&s;cribed, I am obliged to exculpate my&s;elf from any intentional offence by
fairly laying the truth before them, and humbly appealing to their candour:
or&mdash;according to the language of the &s;tanding theatrical
apology&mdash;their u&s;ual indul|gence.</P>
<P>I was going to begin this chapter in a mo&s;t lovely &s;tyle, by
&s;aying that the bees came about &s;omebody's cradle, and left their honey on
his lips; giving proof that he would be &s;weet and eloquent in di&s;|cour&s;e.
But, ca&s;ting in my mind who this &s;ome|body could be, it pre&s;ently
&s;truck me&mdash;for I 
<Q REND="inline">"do bear a brain"</Q>&mdash;that the point was
not &s;ettled.</P>
<P>This prodigy is related of ST. AMBROSE of Milan. Doctor JOHNSON,
who ought to have known &s;ome|thing about the matter, &s;ays it was PINDAR;
but FENELON affirms it was &s;aid of PLATO by his pre|ceptor SENECA, who, while
the circum&s;tance was warm in his mind, dreamt that a cygnet flew to his
bo&s;om, which, by degrees, became covered with feathers of a mo&s;t beautiful
and dazzling whitene&s;s; <PB N="21" REF="54"> and which, taking wing, flew
with a force and ra|pidity &s;uperior to an eagle:&mdash;and the&s;e prodigies
were &s;o &s;trongly verified in this great man, that CICERO &s;aid of him,
when he grew up, 
<Q REND="inline">"If JUPI|TER had conde&s;cended to &s;peak like
man, he would have u&s;ed the language of PLATO."</Q></P>
<P>Now it cannot be denied but that here is proof upon proof on the
&s;ide of FENELON; and, as he ga|thered this intelligence for the improvement
of princes, one would think that he mu&s;t have made a point of collecting his
materials from the be&s;t au|thorities. But as there is no court of critici&s;m
to appeal to from the fiat of Dr. JOHNSON&mdash;his <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> being
always final upon the&s;e occa&s;ions&mdash;if the reader plea&s;e it &s;hall
&s;tand for PINDAR: not for the living PINDAR, becau&s;e every body knows that,
in|&s;tead of honey, he deals in nothing but gall.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e it is melancholy to lo&s;e the beautiful dream of
SENECA, and the fine &s;aying of CICERO, but ornament and flouri&s;h mu&s;t
give way to truth and Dr. JOHNSON. Be&s;ides, Mr. BOSWELL informs us that the
Doctor had but a pitiful opinion of FE|NELON, for that he would not allow
Telemachus to be written more than 
<Q REND="inline">"pretty well."</Q></P>
<P>Having e&s;tabli&s;hed this important point, I &s;hall 
<PB N="22" REF="55"> regularly proceed to the bu&s;ine&s;s of introducing my
hero, who having &s;et the poets together by the ears before he was born, will
be allowed to have given a pretty good &s;pecimen of the work he was to cut out
for them afterwards.</P>
<P>Many and various are the portents and omens that are &s;aid to
have announced the births, deaths, and marriages of great men and women; and I
could mu&s;ter up a long catalogue of them, from the lady who made &s;o
hand&s;ome a deluge as to &s;wallow up all A&s;ia, to Tom Thumb&mdash;which is
a pretty touch of the bathos&mdash;who was &s;wallowed up by a cow; but that it
would in&s;en&s;ibly draw me into an imitation of certain authors, who are
fonder of &s;hewing their reading than their good manners.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be forgiven however, &s;ince a great man and a prodigy
are almo&s;t &s;ynonimous terms, if I la|ment that nature did not go a &s;ingle
&s;tep out of her road to introduce our hero: neither his father nor his mother
having dreamt any thing prodigious on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Viney indeed had a confu&s;ed idea in a dream of a ba&s;ili&s;k
which kept continually in his way, and the nur&s;e, as &s;he nodded by the fire
&s;ide while Lady Ha|zard was in labour, dreamt that her young ma&s;ter&mdash; 
<PB N="23" REF="56"> for &s;he always &s;aid it would be a boy&mdash;&s;poke
the mo|ment he came into the world, and that he believed any thing you &s;aid
to him; which &s;he &s;agaciou&s;ly interpreted as a &s;ure &s;ign that he
would be very learned, and very much impo&s;ed upon:&mdash;the truth of which
ob&s;ervation the reader may perhaps have occa&s;ion to admire before he and I
part.</P>
<P>Lady Hazard's being brought to bed of a &s;on, to the great joy
of that honourable family, &s;eems then to be the event I hinted at in the
third chap|ter. It really took place about a twelve month after the marriage,
and three years and a quarter&mdash;for I love to be exact&mdash;after the
birth of the fir&s;t &s;on, whom Lord Hazard called Zekiel, after his
grand|father, and this, our hero, Charles, after him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of Lord Hazard would now have been complete, had
it not been imbittered by a con|&s;ideration that the whole e&s;tate being
willed away with the title, he could not do his younge&s;t &s;on the ju&s;tice
he wi&s;hed. To amend, however, this defi|ciency, he re&s;olved to make him a
paragon of learn|ing; and, as he knew very well that had not the former part of
his own life been devoted to idlene&s;s, it would have been le&s;s given to
di&s;&s;ipation, he re|&s;olved to add a complete &s;tudy of the arts to his
&s;on's education.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="57"> In the contemplation of this plan he took
great delight. At length, when Zekiel had attained his eleventh year, he was
&s;ent to Eaton &s;chool, to leave the coa&s;t clear for a proper attention to
the educa|tion of Charles, which his lord&s;hip was determined to &s;uperintend
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Many e&s;&s;ays were made upon his tender intellects, which gave
very promi&s;ing hopes; and now the difficulty was to get him a tutor. Lord
Hazard fairly owned he de&s;paired of finding one to his wi&s;h. He declared he
had him&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed &s;o much ill conduct in men of that de&s;cription,
that he &s;hould be very cautious indeed how he made a choice.</P>
<P>The&s;e doubts he often imparted to Lady Hazard, who &s;aid
&s;he had mixed very little in the world, and therefore was happy whenever he
was &s;o good as to give her his opinion, in order that &s;he might form hers.
She could not help thinking, however, that he was warmer on that &s;ubject than
he otherwi&s;e would have been, had not an ill choice been made in a tutor for
him. She hoped he would be able to find a man who &s;hould have talents, and
yet be hone&s;t.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'If,' &s;aid my lord, 'I could form a tutor, he
&s;hould be ingenuous above all things; not a&s;hamed <PB N="25" REF="58"> if
he found any of tho&s;e trivial vices creeping on him to which human nature is
&s;ubject, to confe&s;s and amend them. Such a kind of man cannot de&s;ign to
do ill, becau&s;e he is &s;orry for his own infirmity. Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s has a
tendency to gratitude, which is with me the fir&s;t of vir|tues. I declare if I
was obliged to accu&s;e a man of a crime, and he could prove his motive to be
in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;imilar to any thing I had ever forgiven in
my&s;elf, I &s;hould in&s;tantly feel an inclination to pardon him. It is the
&s;neaking, un|derhand villain I hate; the hypocrite, the de|ceiver, who
&s;tudies to be a ra&s;cal; who &s;tings while he fawns. But he who acts from
mere in|tuitive principles, may correct his frailty by his judgment; and, at
any rate, you have a declared enemy, and know how to be on your guard. One
&s;tands &s;ome chance with a lion, but who can pro|vide again&s;t the venom of
a &s;low worm?'</Q></P>
<P>Thus ended a conver&s;ation which the reader may hereafter think
I had a rea&s;on for in&s;erting.</P>
<P>Very little pa&s;&s;ed in this family worthy relation till
Ma&s;ter Charles was twelve years old, when one day my lord brought a gentleman
who, he &s;aid, an|&s;wered, in every particular, that de&s;cription of
per|&s;on he had &s;o long and &s;o fruitle&s;sly &s;ought for, as 
<PB N="26" REF="59"> a tutor for his darling &s;on. As to Zekiel, he did not
believe him to be his &s;on at all, though he had in vain tried to prove him
legally illegitimate. He therefore took very little further notice of him than
to remit him money; nor did he expre&s;s either a&s;|toni&s;hment or
di&s;&s;atisfaction at being told he was both an arrant dunce and an arrant
puppy. On the contrary, he &s;arca&s;tically ob&s;erved 
<Q REND="inline">"he would do well enough for a lord."</Q></P>
<P>Having brought matters in the family of Lord Hazard to a &s;ort
of &s;tand &s;till, the reader and I will now, if he plea&s;e, take a walk
acro&s;s the bridge into Roebuck park. But, upon recollection, being come now
to the center which commands a view of the whole village of Ca&s;tlewick, and
its inhabitants making a part of our dramatis per&s;onae, we will take a
&s;hort view of that little community, which had really &s;omething to
recommend it to our notice.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="60">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH A VILLAGE IS DESCRIBED, NOT UNLIKE AN ANT-HILL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE village of Ca&s;tlewick contained about five hundred
inhabitants. About half the men and boys were generally employed at the trade
of wool-comb|ing; part of the women and girls in carding, &s;pin|ning,
twi&s;ting, and knitting; the more intelligent and experienced of the men in
journeying to large towns to purcha&s;e &s;heep, and &s;upply factors,
clothiers, and ho&s;iers with wool, yarn, wor&s;ted, &s;tockings, nightcaps,
&s;ocks, and &s;uch other articles as they manufactured. The lower order of the
men and boys were employed in tilling, manuring, and enclo&s;ing; and the
remainder of the women bu&s;ied them&s;elves in hou&s;ehold affairs, buying and
&s;elling the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and &s;uch other occupations as the
vicar&mdash;for this pari&s;h had no curate&mdash;pointed out to them.</P>
<P>The vicar had two deputies, the clerk and the &s;choolma&s;ter;
and the&s;e three were all the per&s;ons in the village who did no bodily
labour:&mdash;for Ca&s;|tlewick <PB N="28" REF="61"> could boa&s;t neither
lawyer, exci&s;eman, nor apothecary.</P>
<P>Their good pa&s;tor undertook to regulate the tem|poral, as well
as &s;piritual, concerns of his flock; and, by a &s;crupulous di&s;charge of
his duty as their trea&s;urer, &s;hewed them more than by a thou&s;and precepts
how much it was their intere&s;t to act with truth and integrity towards each
other. Not that his preaching was not of a piece with his example, for every
Sunday they heard &s;ome new le&s;&s;on of &s;weet and comfortable morality
from his mouth; for he, in&s;tead of de&s;cribing religion as a denunci|ation
of vengeance, and the deity as delighting in puni&s;hment, &s;oftened that high
duty into a gentle and intelligent &s;y&s;tem of morality, by inculcating the
principles of &s;ocial virtue and brotherly love, and repre&s;enting the
creator as an indulgent father watching with anxious and tender care over the
in|tere&s;t and happine&s;s of his children, and regarding their virtuous
endeavours with a &s;mile of cele&s;tial benevolence:&mdash;thus troubling his
hearers with no|thing beyond the reach of that capacity which had fallen to
their &s;hare, and leaving the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of dogmas to larger
communities, who better under|&s;tood cavilling.</P>
<P>The clerk and the &s;choolma&s;ter kept an account 
<PB N="29" REF="62"> of the receipts and di&s;bur&s;ements throughout the
pari&s;h. The&s;e were faithfully audited by the vicar. Ten of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of the inhabitants, who acted as a committee for the re&s;t,
were called in every week to the ve&s;try, where the books were always forth
coming for general in&s;pection.</P>
<P>Every other regulation for the plea&s;ure and ad|vantage of this
happy community was proportion|ably wi&s;e and &s;alutary. Thus cheerfulne&s;s
&s;miled on their labours; content converted their pittance into plenty;
health, ea&s;e, and good humour accom|panied their &s;teps, and they pa&s;&s;ed
their time in the exerci&s;e of as much moral rectitude as would have
immortalized them&mdash;had they been born an|cient Spartans&mdash;without
dreaming they did more than a common duty, for the &s;ake of general
conve|nience.</P>
<P>By this time I believe the reader begins to &s;u&s;pect that the
vicar, however well di&s;po&s;ed to lend a help|ing hand towards the regulation
of this little com|monwealth, as well as the clerk and the &s;chool|ma&s;ter,
who kept the account of their finances, were but &s;ubordinate actors in this
performance, and here introduced, like the centinels in Hamlet and the
&s;ervants in the Orphan&mdash;both of which circum&s;tances VOLTAIRE is very
angry at&mdash;only to u&s;her in the ca|pital <PB N="30" REF="63">
per&s;onage, who, having once made his appear|ance, is to receive all the
applau&s;e.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that the motions of Ca&s;tlewick appeared to

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH PROVES THAT SOME OF THE OLD FASHIONS ARE NOT TO BE
DESPISED.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY reader and I having pa&s;&s;ed through the rookery that
received us as we left the bridge, are now within &s;ight of the man&s;ion of
Sir Sydney Wal|ter Roebuck, lord of the manor of Ca&s;tlewick, and member of
parliament for the borough of Neither|&s;ide.</P>
<P>The grandfather of this gentleman&mdash;for were I to trouble
the reader with any thing anterior, my de&s;cription would re&s;emble a game of
che&s;s, where bi&s;hops, knights, ca&s;tles, and the king and queen are
continually cro&s;&s;ing each other. Indeed I have two other rea&s;ons for not
going farther back; one is, that in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory Sir Sidney
will talk to us a little about the fame of his ance&s;tors him|&s;elf; and the
other, that, for ought I could ever learn, their lives were, take them all in
all, &s;uch a uniform mixture of morality, loyalty, and bro|therly love, that
the de&s;cription of one would &s;erve for the whole. Their tempers might not
be unaptly <PB N="32" REF="65"> compared to a bowl of punch, for though made up
of the &s;ame contrariety of ingredients in common with the re&s;t of their
fellow creatures, the mixture was &s;o happily blended, that they diffu&s;ed
comfort and cheerfulne&s;s to all around them.</P>
<P>The grandfather then having taken umbrage at court for being
turned out of the cabinet, only be|cau&s;e he maintained that the Lanca&s;hire
witches were harmle&s;s old women&mdash;for which indeed Dr. JOHNSON would have
been as angry with him as the council were, for he tells us he will not &s;ay
there never was any &s;uch thing as witchcraft, for that probably there might
have been, but that it had cea&s;ed&mdash;retired to the man&s;ion of his
forefathers, which gothic and &s;tately &s;tructure the reader and I are
looking at.</P>
<P>There having &s;at contentedly down, with a quiet con&s;cience,
an active mind, and a princely fortune, he con&s;idered&mdash;which was nothing
more than his daily cu&s;tom&mdash;how he might be&s;t be &s;erviceable to his
fellow creatures.</P>
<P>He had not deliberated long on the &s;ubject before he
determined to build the village of Ca&s;tlewick, and, like another Bi&s;hop
Blaze, &s;et up the trade of wool-combing. Nor was this, would he argue, a 
<PB N="33" REF="66"> project unworthy his rank; wool was the &s;taple commodity
of that country he &s;o dearly loved, and for which his ance&s;tors had &s;o
gallantly &s;hed their blood; the wool &s;ack was the emblem of honour, for it
&s;u&s;tained the leading member of the hou&s;e, and took place in that
a&s;&s;embly of every thing but the throne. He had yet a better rea&s;on: his
&s;cheme would give employment to his tenants and other poor neighbours, and he
&s;hould be &s;ure to receive the daily ble&s;&s;ings of many families who
would owe a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to their hone&s;t labours, under the au|&s;pices
of his bounty.</P>
<P>This gentleman lived to &s;ee his benevolent plan carried into
execution, and he enjoined his &s;on to pur&s;ue it. This injunction was
faithfully complied with, but the pre&s;ent Sir Sidney con&s;iderably
in|crea&s;ed the number of hou&s;es and inhabitants, al|tered the former rules
and orders into a more regu|lar and dige&s;ted &s;et of laws, and called in the
vicar and his adherents, as the reader has already &s;een, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him
in their execution.</P>
<P>Thus, burning the Lanca&s;hire witches was pro|ductive of one
public benefit at lea&s;t; for, had not the humanity of good old Sir Sidney
taken fire at the cruel propo&s;ition, in all probability the village of
Ca&s;tlewick would never have been built.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="67"> The &s;urviving gentleman of this family I
now take the liberty of introducing in form to the rea|der. He had many
&s;ingularities: one I have al|ready hinted at: another was a fixed aver&s;ion
to cards and dice; yet he was a &s;trenuous encourager of all athletic
&s;ports. He would &s;ometimes pitch the bar him&s;elf, and was allowed to be
the be&s;t bowler at cricket within ten miles. He was an ad|mirer of the arts,
and never failed to bring with him from town, at the end of every
&s;e&s;&s;ions, a poet, a painter, and a mu&s;ician, who were obliged&mdash;and
&s;o indeed were all others who wi&s;hed for his e&s;teem&mdash;to accompany
him in the different departments of his duty, as he called the regulation of
his little commonwealth. Nay &s;ometimes he would &s;et them to work, on which
occa&s;ion he enjoyed their awk|wardne&s;s.</P>
<P>Seeing once the wig of a coun&s;ellor catch in the girt of a
twi&s;ting mill, as he was unhandily turning it round, it afforded no &s;mall
diver&s;ion to the ba|ronet, who facetiou&s;ly exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">"My good old friend, you let your learning fly
about at a &s;trange rate."</Q></P>
<P>No man was more admired, nor &s;ought le&s;s to be &s;o, than
Sir Sidney. Even the boobies, with whom he could not mix, becau&s;e he never
&s;wore, gamed, <PB N="35" REF="68"> nor drank pint bumpers, declared he was a
gruffi&s;h odd &s;ort of a hearty cock. In &s;hort, his heart was benevolent,
his means were ample, he was in the prime of life, &s;urrounded with hundreds
of &s;in|cere friends&mdash;which is a bold thing to &s;ay-re|&s;pected,
valued, e&s;teemed, adored, almo&s;t deified, and yet he was not happy. I could
tell the reader why, but &s;hall only &s;o far indulge him as to &s;ay that,
according to Sir Sidney's own account, his unhappine&s;s was occa&s;ioned by a
phantom he had &s;een, which had &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, that he could not
re&s;t in his bed till he had opened his mind to it:&mdash;for, were I to
unriddle the whole &s;ecret of this gho&s;t, the &s;pirit and the reader's
curio&s;ity would vani&s;h together.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore collect together all the leading
circum&s;tances, that I may the more adroitly intro|duce the time when, the
place where, and the man|ner how, it appeared. And this has been a privi|lege
to authors and old women time immemorial; a climax having ever been allowed the
proper mo|ment to introduce a cata&s;trophe, and the candle's burning blue a
&s;ignal for the approach of a hob|goblin.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as I &s;hall have terrified my readers
into a belief of the proper progno&s;tic, the <PB N="36" REF="69"> gho&s;t
&s;hall &s;talk forth. To &s;uffer this &s;ooner would be inartificial, and
con&s;equently an impeachment of my capacity of tantalizing the reader, which
would be an indelible di&s;grace to the fraternity of novel writers, &s;ome of
whom have excited no other &s;en|&s;ation.</P>
<P>I hope, however, I &s;hall be forgiven if I differ in the main
from this mode of con&s;tructing my work, and not deemed an innovator if I
endeavour to make &s;atisfaction keep pace with expectation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING THE NECESSARY SHADOW, TO HEIGHTEN THE BEAUTIES OF
CASTLEWICK.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I MEAN to lead the reader on, chapter after chap|ter, through
this hi&s;tory, in the &s;ame manner as we are led, day after day, through
life. They who experience the large&s;t portions of human happine&s;s, are
&s;ure to have &s;ome unplea&s;ant moments in every four-and-twenty hours;
whereas the &s;ame degree of mi&s;ery will not &s;o far overcome the fortitude
of others: but they find now and then a tran&s;ient gleam of plea&s;ure, which,
like an accidental creek through the wall of a dungeon, magnifies the light of
comfort, by peeping in upon ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of every dull day, we naturally look forward in
hopes of finding the next more agree|able. Thus people comfort them&s;elves
with 
<Q REND="inline">"to|morrow is a new day;"&mdash;"we &s;hall
&s;ee how mat|ters will go to-morrow;"</Q> and thus cheri&s;h a laudable
expectation, though it end perhaps only in di&s;appoinment.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="71"> I am led to the&s;e remarks by the
recollection of my having promi&s;ed to tell the reader what Sir Sid|ney wanted
to make him completely happy. To do this &s;uddenly, and without preparation,
would &s;eem to &s;hew that I know not the way to elevate and &s;urpri&s;e; a
my&s;tery which more than Mr. Bayes have thought the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential
requi&s;ite of an au|thor.</P>
<P>As no reader, therefore, can rea&s;onably de&s;ire me to violate
a &s;tanding rule, I &s;hall now proceed to unfold a nice chain of
circum&s;tances, which will lead directly to the main event.</P>
<P>In the de&s;cription that has been given of Ca&s;tle|wick, I
more than doubt I have been &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;|pected of that kind of
embelli&s;hment in which heroes are &s;aid to deal when &s;peaking of their
ex|ploits, and lovers when extolling the charms of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. In
fact, to &s;uppo&s;e a body of nearly five hundred people, of different
&s;exes, ages, and complexions, could be perfectly &s;ecure from evil in
them&s;elves, or guarded again&s;t the tempta|tions of others, would be to
&s;uppo&s;e an order of be|ings that certainly &s;hall not intrude them&s;elves
here, my intention being to treat of human creatures, the be&s;t of whom, I am
afraid, are not exempt from frailty. I would only have it under&s;tood that
vices <PB N="39" REF="72"> exi&s;ted in Ca&s;tlewick no longer than till they
were found out; at which time the parties were, for the fir&s;t offence,
reprehended; for a &s;econd, mulct; for a third, condemned to have no
intercour&s;e with their neighbours; and, for a fourth, con&s;idered as
incorrigible; and, without favour or affection, ba|ni&s;hed from the place, and
deprived for ever of any claim to its advantages.</P>
<P>When this happened, which I will &s;ay was very &s;eldom, the
offenders generally took refuge in an|other village, about three miles
di&s;tant, called Little Hockley, the inhabitants of which place were mo&s;tly
tenants of Lord Hazard; and, as that nobleman had found no great difficulty in
bringing over the men, and the women too, to any of his purpo&s;es, it may
ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed they were a very likely people to afford &s;uch a
left-handed a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Little Hockley then was as famous for &s;pringes, trammel nets,
and pitched battles, as Ca&s;tlewick was for cricket, quoits, and tranquillity;
and if one was without an attorney, that a proper number of that worthy
fraternity might be kept up, the other maintained two. Nay, a &s;pruce young
man, who indeed had been porter to an ob&s;cure druggi&s;t, in a blind alley
near Ro&s;emary-lane, e&s;tabli&s;hed him|&s;elf there as an apothecary, who,
when Lord Ha|zard <PB N="40" REF="73"> fir&s;t began to re&s;ide at his &s;eat,
ordered a new &s;ign, and added to his former qualifications &s;urgeon and
man-midwife.</P>
<P>One great plea&s;ure of the wicked wights of Little Hockley, was
to torment their more fortunate neigh|bours of Ca&s;tlewick, This they effected
by certain railings and backbitings; to which exploits of their fancy, they
added others, which were achieved by means of their fingers; for &s;carcely a
week pa&s;t but &s;ome hog was ham&s;trung, hor&s;e lamed, or hou&s;e dog
hanged. Sucking pigs and chickens di&s;appear|ed from their &s;ties and
roo&s;ts, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a fox; the cows were milked in the
night by two-handed urchins, and lambs ran away with by two-legged wolves.</P>
<P>The&s;e depredations cea&s;ed now and then, upon Sir Sidney's
application to Lord Hazard, but they con&s;tantly broke out again. In the mean
time, cer|tain defiances were breathed, and &s;ometimes a few blows
exchanged.</P>
<P>The vicar was not without frequent apprehen|&s;ions that &s;ome
of his pari&s;hioners, meeting with &s;o many in&s;ulting provocations, and
being healthy, &s;pi|rited men, would once for all take &s;uch a revenge as
might involve the community in trouble; for one <PB N="41" REF="74"> or two of
them had been already cited to the quar|ter &s;e&s;&s;ions, where it required
the whole intere&s;t of Sir Sidney to prevent their paying heavy damages,
though what they did was perhaps in re&s;entment of &s;ome in&s;ult offered to
a wife or daughter.</P>
<P>At the time Lord Hazard petitioned the lords for his divorce,
Sir Sidney was attending with great earne&s;tne&s;s his duty in the lower
hou&s;e. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a month had &s;carcely
pa&s;&s;ed before the Hockley men, grown more au|dacious than ever, had
irritated their peaceable neighbours &s;o often, that three &s;tout brui&s;ing
matches had already been the con&s;equence; and though the Hockley boxers would
have cut no contemptible figure in the learned Mr. MENDOZA's &s;chool, yet it
&s;o happened&mdash;perhaps becau&s;e a right cau&s;e is half the
victory&mdash;the men of Ca&s;tlewick were the con|querors.</P>
<P>Seeing matters at this extremity, and unwilling to trouble Sir
Sidney, the vicar determined to pay a vi&s;it to the curate of Little Hockley,
for that pa|ri&s;h, which was a rectory, had not been ble&s;t with a &s;ight of
its incumbent for ten years. Indeed that worthy member of the church, who was
al&s;o a mem|ber of a gaming club, commuted for the tithes and all other
immunities of his living, and had given up, <PB N="42" REF="75"> among other
advantages, the right of appointing a curate.</P>
<P>The gentleman who made this purcha&s;e lived in the
neighbourhood, and was called Major Malpla|quet. He had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf in the wars of the low countries, when very young, under the fa|mous
Duke of MALBOROUGH, and was now late in life in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
paternal &s;eat, and a very fine fortune.</P>
<P>The Major had a chaplain, who, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, did
not look much like a clergyman. He had been in the wars too, and indeed he
fought much better than he prayed. I will illu&s;trate his charac|ter by an
anecdote.</P>
<P>A clergyman being on a vi&s;it to a captain of a man of war, a
&s;mart gale &s;prung up &s;o &s;uddenly that the ve&s;&s;el parted her cable,
and was hurried out to &s;ea. No harm happened, but it gave the crew a great
deal of trouble. The boat&s;wain, who in the language of his me&s;&s;mates, was
a dry hand, coming upon the foreca&s;tle, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">'Sink me if I did not think as this would be the
ca&s;e. I will be keel|hauled if we have had a bit of good luck &s;ince that
there par&s;on came aboard. Of all the fi&s;h that &s;wims, I cannot abide a
par&s;on. I never &s;ailed <PB N="43" REF="76"> but once before with a
par&s;on, and then we had not a fair wind the whole voyage.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never but once!' &s;aid one of his companions,
'why a chaplain's par&s;on, 'ent he?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ava&s;t that &s;lack chatter,' &s;aid the
boat&s;wain, 'a chaplain a par&s;on, hey!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I tell you he is,' &s;ays the other, 'he
wears black, and &s;ays prayers.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then I &s;uppo&s;e,' retorted the
boat&s;wain, 'the devil's an alderman becau&s;e he wears horns.&mdash;All the
chaplains I ever knew were hone&s;t hearty cocks: good fellows, who would not
mind mak|ing a curtain of their black gown, to hide a pretty la&s;s. None of
your grave thinking gentlemen; but roaring boys, who <HI>&s;hewing</HI> you
what they are, and <HI>telling</HI> you what they ought to be, leave you to
your choice whether you'll go to heaven by their preaching, or to the
&s;outhward by their ex|ample.'</Q></P>
<P>This worthy member of the church militant, who&s;e name was
Standfa&s;t, had, in his younger days&mdash;for he was now near
fifty&mdash;performed as many exploits of the bucki&s;h kind as ever
di&s;tingui&s;hed <PB N="44" REF="77"> the Mohawks, Sweaters, or any other
&s;et of de&s;pe|rados who u&s;ed formerly to parade the &s;treets of London,
to the terror of every decrepid watchman, and the demolition of his lanthorn.
He was the very man who once propo&s;ed to give the waiter of a coffee-hou&s;e
a rouleau, to &s;ee <HI>how he would look.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, he had killed his man; and, hav|ing
ab&s;conded to Flanders, he ran away with a nun from a convent, married her,
&s;pent her fortune, &s;et her adrift, and entered a volunteer in the army,
where the officers&mdash;finding him a genteel man&mdash;be|ing informed of his
function, procured him a chap|laincy.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation Standfa&s;t was particularly noticed by
Major Malplaquet, who being a man of &s;ingular credulity, &s;o attached
him&s;elf to his new acquain|tance, that he &s;oon became his all in all.
Indeed the chaplain had many qualities that rendered him agreeable to the
major. He would drink claret, play at put, and beat a reveille, with any man in
the corps. Be&s;ides the&s;e winning accompli&s;hments, he had other
accommodating methods of endearing him&s;elf to his patron. He often
complimented him with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome yielding female he had
him&s;elf grown tired of, and never failed, if hu&s;bands or fathers grew
impertinent and trouble&s;ome, to <PB N="45" REF="78"> brazen the matter out.
In &s;hort, having gained a con&s;ummate knowledge of the world, by a
&s;crupulous hardne&s;s of belief, a total want of every feeling but
&s;elf-intere&s;t, and a critical exerci&s;e of ob&s;ervation, he penetrated
every man's characteri&s;tic foible, and worked upon it as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such was the Rev. Mr. Standfa&s;t, private chaplain to Major
Malplaquet, and curate of Little Hock|ley. To this per&s;on I am going to
introduce the vicar of Ca&s;tlewick, who, con&s;cious of the rectitude of his
own intentions, was indulging him&s;elf in the flattering hope that his
efforts, in conjunction with tho&s;e of the curate, would effectually make up
every breach between the two contending parties.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>BEING FULL OF PASTIME AND PRODIGALITY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>To the qualities already celebrated in Tiger
Standfa&s;t&mdash;for &s;o had he been nicknamed by his companions, from the
utter impo&s;&s;ibility of taming him&mdash;I &s;hall add, that, let him
conver&s;e with whom he might, he, as the phra&s;e is, knew his man; and was
always provided with &s;o many &s;hifts and turns, that come what would he was
never off his guard. Be&s;ides he had an admirable knack of &s;iding with his
enemy, the better to laugh at him,</P>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e this, le&s;t the reader
&s;hould wonder how it came about that the moment he &s;aw Mr. Mildman he
&s;hould not only welcome him with all imaginable courte&s;ey, but de|clare he
intended, the next morning, to have paid him a vi&s;it, in order to con&s;ult
with him on the very &s;ubject which had now brought them
together:&mdash;adding, as he took the good old vicar by the hand, that he had
a hard time of it indeed, but bad ex|amples were terrible things, and if Lord
Hazard <PB N="47" REF="80"> would encourage his tenants in
idlene&s;s&mdash;which Mr. Mildman's experience mu&s;t have long taught him is
the corner &s;tone of the temple of corruption&mdash;of what avail were all his
prayers, nay his tears, in en|forcing either their duty towards God or their
neighbour.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed vicar could &s;carcely credit his ears. He
had not to learn the general character of Standfa&s;t; but, on the contrary,
had both heard and believed much ill of him: and indeed, on his way, had
uncharitably, as he now thought, conjured up a number of difficulties in his
mind, which he expected would be thrown in the way of his benefi|cent plan.</P>
<P>This Standfa&s;t well knew, and as the fir&s;t blow in argument,
as well as boxing, is a manife&s;t ad|vantage, he had the inward
&s;atisfaction&mdash;I &s;ay in|ward becau&s;e his features betrayed no &s;uch
&s;en&s;ation&mdash;of &s;eeing his antagoni&s;t &s;truck agha&s;t.</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue this fir&s;t blow, therefore, he thus went on. 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;ee Mr. Mildman you are &s;hocked to find I
have no more influence over my pari&s;hio|ners.'</Q></P>
<P>The vicar, to whom truth was as habitual as per|jury 
<PB N="48" REF="81"> is to an attorney, with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity of heart
immediately an&s;wered: 
<Q REND="inline">'You have not at all divined the &s;ubject of my
a&s;toni&s;hment. I was admiring that the world could be &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily
&s;landerous to have de&s;cribed you as a di&s;&s;olute and immoral character,
and one who&mdash;pardon me for u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion, was a &s;candal to
your cloth; whereas you appear to me&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ah,' cried Standfa&s;t, 'poor deluded wretches
I forgive them. But what do they &s;ay? It is of con&s;equence that I &s;hould
clear my character to you. Their &s;lander I &s;mile at, but your ill opi|nion!
What do they &s;ay, dear Mr. Mildman?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Sir,' replied the vicar, '&s;ince I &s;ee
you bear it with a proper firmne&s;s, I will tell you.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sit down &s;ir,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The vicar having complied with his reque&s;t, pro|ceeded to
inform him that, in the fir&s;t place, it was &s;aid he drank very hard for a
clergyman. 
<Q REND="inline">'Not a drop more, in general, than two bottles
at a &s;it|ting,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'and never more than four.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Four bottles!' exclaimed the vicar.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why what is that;' cried Standfa&s;t very
calmly, 'if, my dear &s;ir, you had been in countries where I have, you mu&s;t
have drank. Ay, ay, it is better to be car|ried <PB N="49" REF="82"> off to bed
in liquor than in an ague. Then, between our&s;elves, the major is a notable
toper; never &s;tirs till the &s;ixth bottle, though there &s;hould be only he
and I to drink it: and I dare not di&s;oblige my patron: I hate ingratitude. I
only a&s;k you Mr. Mildman if any thing could induce you to thwart the will of
Sir Sidney?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' cried the vicar, with a look of extreme
&s;en&s;ibility, 'it is the &s;tudy of my life to de&s;erve his
bounty.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That was &s;poken,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'too
warmly not to have come from the heart. You mu&s;t, my dear &s;ir, pledge me in
a gla&s;s to Sir Sidney's health. Here bring &s;ome wine.'</Q></P>
<P>The vicar, who, though he never was drunk in his life, could
take a gla&s;s or two, and very fre|quently did at Sir Sidney's table, made no
great difficulty to comply.</P>
<P>Two bottles of wine were immediately brought, two gla&s;&s;es
poured out, and &s;oon emptied to the health of the vicar's patron. Standfa&s;t
a&s;ked Mr. Mildman if he liked his port as well as Sir Sidney's? at the &s;ame
time excu&s;ing him&s;elf from drinking any, &s;aying that nothing but claret

'it is a pro&s;titution of the word. Can it be honour, becau&s;e a man has
perhaps unwittingly affronted me, to &s;hed his blood, and de&s;olate his

whom it is &s;afer to face a pi&s;tol than a halter that I mu&s;t either fear
to de|tect their villany, or put my life upon a footing with theirs.'</Q></P>

<P><PB N="52" REF="85"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Knocked down!' hollowed the vicar, 'and &s;o
make the breach too wide for all po&s;&s;ibility of re|paration. No &s;ir, the
highe&s;t courage is to pity pa&s;&s;ion, not take advantage of it. Convince a
man into a conce&s;&s;ion, and your triumph is doubly noble. Why &s;hould a
fally of pa&s;&s;ion be &s;ooner re&s;ented than the &s;ally of a madman?
Be&s;ides, ac|cording to your own rules, not to &s;peak of its wickedne&s;s,
can any thing be &s;o &s;illy as duelling? A man receives an injury: what is
the &s;atisfaction he a&s;ks? why truly he invites the aggre&s;&s;or in terms
of perfect politene&s;s, to meet him at a cer|tain time, where he reque&s;ts,
as an attonement for the wrong, that his adver&s;ary may exert all his &s;kill
to take away his life.'</Q></P>
<P>The vicar, who had now drank two gla&s;&s;es, made the above
declaration with uncommon vehemence. Standfa&s;t, in a pretended rapture
embraced him, confe&s;&s;ed he was become his convert, and filling the
gla&s;&s;es for the third time, gave the major for a toa&s;t.</P>
<P>This the vicar could not avoid drinking. He de|termined however
it &s;hould be the la&s;t; three gla&s;&s;es being at any time his utmo&s;t
&s;tint. He had &s;carcely drank when, whether it was owing to the <HI>goute de
la terreinne,</HI> or being warm upon the &s;ubject, or what I &s;hall not now
take upon me to &s;ay, but cer|tainly <PB N="53" REF="86"> he gave manife&s;t
&s;igns of being di&s;ordered from top to toe. His eyes &s;parkled, his head
be|came dizzy, and his chair was of the &s;ame u&s;e to him as a pole is to a
rope-dancer; for, without it, he a&s;&s;uredly would have tumbled down. Nor
could he help te&s;tifying &s;ome applau&s;e at the end of a little
<HI>chan&s;onette,</HI> which Standfa&s;t had been negligently &s;inging. At
this the latter declared, with a violent oath, that he was the heartie&s;t
companion he ever knew.</P>
<P>The vicar blamed him &s;everely for &s;wearing, but, &s;tamping
his foot to enforce the rebuke, he trod upon the leg of a dog that lay before
the fire. The cur having received a private intimation from his ma&s;ter, flew
at the vicar, who, with great difficulty, and an exclamation of 
<Q REND="inline">'damn the dog,'</Q> got out of his way.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t now fell foul of the vicar; telling him that he
might plainly &s;ee there were provocations that might induce a man to &s;wear;
that the words them&s;elves were no more than other words; and that men u&s;ed
indi&s;criminately God ble&s;s you, and its oppo&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion, when
neither a benediction nor a cur&s;e was in their hearts: which he was &s;ure
was the ca&s;e in relation to the vicar, as the excla|mation 
<PB N="54" REF="87"> again&s;t the dog was certainly uttered with|out the
&s;malle&s;t premeditated malice.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh &s;ir,' &s;aid poor Mildman, who&s;e
&s;peech now became affected, 'I would not wi&s;h the de&s;truction of the
&s;malle&s;t reptile. As to the poor dumb creature, what he did was natural. I
trod upon him, and he flew at me: I did him an injury, and he re&s;ented
it.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ju&s;t my ca&s;e,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'in the
affair of the duel.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh no,' cried the vicar; as to the
duel&mdash;the duel&mdash;you &s;ee in relation to the duel&mdash;a man that is
intoxicated with pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'is as bad,' inter|rupted Standfa&s;t, 'as a man
intoxicated with liquor.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh yes,' cried the vicar, 'that is another
ter|rible evil. When a man is drunk, he feels&mdash;that is the liquor mounts
to his head&mdash;and if the gid|dine&s;s&mdash;which is the effect
of&mdash;what is the mat|ter with me&mdash;I&mdash;but it is no &s;uch
thing&mdash;it is&mdash;im&mdash;im&mdash;impo&s;&s;ible that&mdash;Oh dear
me&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>Poor Mildman, &s;inking back in his chair, now fell fa&s;t
a&s;leep; which Standfa&s;t no &s;ooner &s;aw, than he ordered in two &s;turdy
fellows, who were at <PB N="55" REF="88"> hand, and bid them lay the vicar in a
certain field, where &s;ome of his flock would be &s;ure to find him.</P>
<P>This was all that Standfa&s;t really meant; for, be|ing a
perfect &s;chool boy at a frolic, and having long indulged a de&s;ire of
touching the vicar on the &s;ide of his &s;obriety, upon hearing of his coming
to con|&s;ult with him, he had infu&s;ed a few grains of crude opium into a
bottle of port, which cau&s;ed that <HI>goute de la terreine</HI> the vicar
complained of, and &s;o acted both upon his head and his un&s;u&s;picious
temper as, at the third gla&s;s, to throw him into a complete &s;tate of
intoxication.</P>
<P>This deception I &s;hould have imparted at the be|ginning of
this chapter, but for my con&s;tant ob&s;er|vance of that nece&s;&s;ary
etiquette which I hinted to my readers in the beginning of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The two fellows, however, who carried out the vicar, were not
&s;o ea&s;ily contented. To get the par|&s;on completely into their clutches,
was &s;uch a tri|umph, that they were determined to make the mo&s;t of it. They
therefore &s;tript him of his coat, put him on an old jerkin, patched with a
hundred different colours, &s;et him in the middle of a field, upon a broken
chair, propt up by a few &s;takes, to prevent <PB N="56" REF="89"> him from
falling, where he looked exactly like a figure placed to frighten the
crows.</P>
<P>Very fortunately for the poor vicar, the clerk and the
&s;choolma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ed over the field a few minutes after the Hockley men
had left him. They were go|ing to Little Hockley with a view to meet the good
man, and learn the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize; and were &s;carcely within a
hundred yards of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;carecrow when they &s;aw it move of
it&s;elf, as it ap|peared, for there was not a breath of wind &s;tirring. Upon
this, looking with more attention, it got upon its legs, &s;taggered two or
three paces, and fell down.</P>
<P>Perfectly convinced it mu&s;t be a human being, they went up to
it; but what words can de&s;cribe their a&s;toni&s;hment when they heard the
voice and beheld the features of the vicar.</P>
<P>The two men who had &s;tood aloof now made their appearance.
They were &s;oon afterwards joined by almo&s;t half the village, who, &s;eeing
the vicar in the hands of his friends, began to open upon them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Fine doings indeed,' &s;aid one; 'ay, ay, the
&s;till &s;ow &s;ucks all the grains.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' cried another, 'there be black
&s;heep at Ca&s;tlewick as well <PB N="57" REF="90"> as at other places.'</Q>
The clerk and &s;choolma&s;ter retorted, that they were &s;ure &s;ome trick had
been played.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odd rot it,' &s;aid a third, 'a reare trick to
be &s;ure. Here mu&s;t your par&s;on cum to zee our par&s;on, and nothing would
zarve un, as he zed, but bleeding the zellers, and zo you do zee, after he had
got mean drunk, we took and geed un an airing in our veeld, to fright away the
crows.'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried another, 'your drunken
par&s;on makes a mortal good &s;carecrow!'</Q> at which they all &s;et up a
hor&s;e laugh.</P>
<P>The clerk and the &s;choolma&s;ter having a&s;ked the vicar
&s;everal que&s;tions, and found, from his utter incapacity to give a rational
an&s;wer, they &s;tood very little chance of knowing the truth&mdash;for as to
a &s;ingle tittle to his prejudice, nothing could induce them to credit
it&mdash;they contented them&s;elves with de|manding his coat, hat, and wig,
which were pe|remptorily refu&s;ed; the ringleader &s;wearing they &s;hould be
put upon a figure of the vicar, and that very night burnt in effigy.</P>
<P>Seeing that all their attempts to recover the&s;e &s;poils were
in vain, their next care was how to get <PB N="58" REF="91"> home their charge,
when, fortunately, a tilted cart happening to go by, they called the driver,
who knowing them, with great readine&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted to con|vey the vicar to
his vehicle, heartily concerned at his deplorable condition, and vowing revenge
again&s;t tho&s;e who had reduced him to it.</P>
<P>The cart &s;et off one way, and the crowd another, &s;houting in
triumph as they bore away their tro|phies, and &s;wearing to exhibit them upon
a pile of faggots as &s;oon as it &s;hould be dark.</P>
<P>Whether they did &s;o or not will be known here|after; but not
in the next chapter, that being ap|propriated for another &s;ubject. Be&s;ides,
the reader may wi&s;h to be relea&s;ed for a time from the brutes of Little
Hockley. Nay it is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may, in &s;ome &s;mall degree,
revolt at the&s;e latter circum&s;tances. What a &s;hocking indignity to make
&s;o amiable a man drunk, let him &s;wear, and after|wards introduce him as a
&s;carecrow!</P>
<P>To the&s;e objections&mdash;for I own I am my&s;elf &s;hocked at
the facts&mdash;I mu&s;t beg to plead that I am only the hi&s;torian of the&s;e
tran&s;actions; but, if I were the inventor, I really think that they are the
very cunning of the &s;cene; for the more attrocious <PB N="59" REF="92"> the
Hockley men appear, the more lu&s;tre will be thrown round the worthies of
Ca&s;tlewick.</P>
<P>As for the &s;wearing, I own I had &s;ome idea of &s;mothering
it, but I will prove beyond contra|diction that it is natural even in the
excellent Mr. Mildman.</P>
<P>The reader cannot wi&s;h for a more truly moral character to
illu&s;trate the po&s;ition than Doctor JOHNSON. This great man, we are told by
Mr. BOSWEL, while on his tour once made u&s;e of the words 
<Q REND="inline">"what the devil:"</Q>&mdash;I forget whether it
was on that evening the young lady &s;at upon his knee, for then there would
have been no great improba|bility in his feeling the gentleman he mentioned a
little bu&s;y:&mdash;but he ha&s;tily recalled him&s;elf, and corrected his
expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now 
<Q REND="inline">"what the devil,"</Q> from Dr. JOHNSON,
perfectly &s;ober, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, is about upon a par with 
<Q REND="inline">"damn the dog"</Q> from Mr. Mildman, drunk; for
drunkenne&s;s has the &s;ame effect upon the &s;pirits, whether we fall into it
by accident or de&s;ign. Nay drugs and charms may very likely create a
&s;tronger delirium, and I have no manner of doubt but that if Dr. JOHNSON
could that evening have been prevailed upon to drink fermented liquor, 
<PB N="60" REF="93"> it is within bare po&s;&s;ibility&mdash;for I contend for
no more&mdash;that he might have whi&s;pered to his friend BOSWELL that the
lady was a damned fine girl, or &s;ome &s;uch bucki&s;hne&s;s.</P>

<P>STANDFAST, as &s;oon as he under&s;tood what had been done with

that the matter had been carried a great deal too far. How|ever, at the major's

indeed on one article, which was in &s;aying that the vicar drank like a

<Q REND="inline">'but,' &s;aid he, looking very earne&s;tly at

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You may be a&s;&s;ured the wor&s;t of

you can do with &s;uch a man is not to tru&s;t him too far: but how dreadful it
is to be al|ways doubting a man you would wi&s;h to think well of. You will
&s;ay he keeps you a &s;tranger to his hypocri&s;y, and leaves you almo&s;t

<P>The two gentlemen being left to them&s;elves, a &s;ilence of a

<P>Standfa&s;t, who had taken good time to &s;ort his cards, began
now to con&s;ider how he &s;hould play his game; and knowing the major's

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You very well know, major, you are upwards of

Ghent?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'What the coun&s;ellor's wi&s;e?' cried the
major. 'She was a charming woman, by my faith. Come give me &s;ome wine. I

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t; 'but major
nei|ther you nor I boggled at her being married, that I recollect.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'True, true,' cried the major,' but that you
know was a different affair.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It was indeed,' returned Standfa&s;t, 'for I
in&s;i&s;t upon it I &s;hewed my&s;elf, in that in&s;tance, capable of a more
exalted friend&s;hip than you are; for I loved her, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her, and
yet gave her up to you: deprived my&s;elf of a &s;weet felicity to oblige my
friend. Ah major you never got the &s;tart of <PB N="69" REF="102"> me but in
this la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s. How different things u&s;ed to be. The gaye&s;t, the
mo&s;t accompli&s;hed yielded to me in the art of plea&s;ing, and till I was
&s;atisfied none dared attempt to make a choice.&mdash;Now, a fooli&s;h woman,
who loves neither of us, is to &s;ow di&s;&s;ention between two friends, who
are all the world to each other.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Dam'me,' cried the major, 'but &s;he &s;hall
not; and if it was only a mi&s;tre&s;s, cur&s;e me if I don't think that tongue
of yours would prevail with me not to &s;tand upon niceties: but you know,
Stand|fa&s;t, as it is'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' cried the chaplain, 'however mi&s;erable I
may be, I will con&s;ume in &s;ilence rather than ut|ter another
&s;yllable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well that is friendly, &s;aid the major.
How|ever,' returned the chaplain, 'I hope you will lay an injunction on Mrs.
Malplaquet to treat me with civility.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh you may depend upon that,' an&s;wered the
major.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And I think,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'I may
venture <PB N="70" REF="103"> to in&s;i&s;t that I am not the hypocrite the
lady has thought proper to call me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I'll an&s;wer for that,' &s;aid the
major.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, no,' repeated the chaplain, 'any
&s;coundrel if you plea&s;e, Mrs. Malplaquet, but a hypocrite.'</Q></P>
<P>After this, upon a&s;king the major if there was any remaining
animo&s;ity, his patron &s;hook him heartily by the hand, and &s;wore he
believed him to be the worthie&s;t fellow upon earth; 
<Q REND="inline">'for where,' &s;aid he, 'is there another man
who, being in love with your wife, would have the hone&s;ty to con|fe&s;s it to
your face?'</Q></P>
<P>Having brought this dialogue between tame cre|dulity and
unblu&s;hing impudence to an end, I &s;hall only add that this worthy
friend&s;hip &s;eemed to be &s;tronger cemented by what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The remainder of the conver&s;ation turned on their former
exploits, in which Standfa&s;t did not lo&s;e &s;ight of the main point; but
enlarged wherever he could on the &s;atisfaction he had always received in
admini&s;tering to the major's plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>At length the major was led off to bed in much 
<PB N="71" REF="104"> about the &s;ame &s;tate of inebriety as the reader may
remember to have &s;een Mr. Mildman.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave of this chapter, I &s;hall &s;ay a word
or two concerning Mrs. Malplaquet.</P>
<P>This lady, who was one of tho&s;e living &s;acrifices which
avarice offers up at the &s;hrine of intere&s;t, had, to &s;ay the truth, a
very difficult ta&s;k to per|form. Her parents, though &s;prung from an
ho|nourable family, were of a younger branch, and, therefore, could give her
but a thou&s;and pounds. The only man &s;he ever loved had de&s;erted her, for
a pert piece of deformity with ju&s;t thirty times that &s;um. Thus, being
perfectly indifferent what be|came of her&s;elf, &s;he gave her hand, as the
good chaplain has already kindly noticed, to the major, out of perfect
obedience to her friends.</P>
<P>The life &s;he had led &s;ince&mdash;the only plea&s;urable
moments of which were tho&s;e &s;he pa&s;&s;ed alone&mdash;may be ea&s;ily
gue&s;&s;ed. The audacious importunities of Standfa&s;t were much bolder than
either he or &s;he had de&s;cribed; and he having repeated them in &s;ome way
that night &s;o as extremely to offend her&mdash;though &s;he was remarkable
for complacency and &s;weetne&s;s of temper&mdash;her anger had &s;o far got
the better of her forbearance, as to force from her that <PB N="72" REF="105">
declaration of Standfa&s;t's di&s;honourable intentions, which the reader has
already &s;een he contrived, by the power he had over his patron, &s;o to
palliate as to leave her the object of re&s;entment rather than him.</P>
<P>I mention this for fear Mrs. Malplaquet, for whom I would wi&s;h
to intere&s;t the reader, &s;hould be wrong|fully &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of
tho&s;e outrageou&s;ly vir|tuous ladies who are eternally &s;inging forth their
own prai&s;es, le&s;t the world, from its natural uncha|ritablene&s;s, &s;hould
unkindly imagine they are en|titled to no prai&s;e at all:&mdash;a practice at
pre&s;ent in great and general credit. And really I do not &s;ee why it
&s;hould not; for who &s;o proper to be the he|rald of a man's merits as
him&s;elf? &s;ince he is &s;urely competent to &s;peak to his own motives, from
a thorough knowledge of whence they originate. And if he &s;hould turn the
be&s;t &s;ide outward, it ought to be con&s;idered as a meritorious expedient
to put him|&s;elf upon a footing with his neighbour, and &s;o pay him in his
own coin; appearance being as requi&s;ite to e&s;tabli&s;h one &s;ort of
reputation as paper to e&s;ta|bli&s;h another; neither of which could
&s;u&s;tain any &s;o|lid credit without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance: for honour is
a commerce as well as bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;uch ideal re|&s;ources often prevent
bankruptcies in both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONTAINING TWO NEW CHARACTERS&mdash;PERFECTLY ORIGI|NAL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE worthy curate, in his way home, exulting at this new
in&s;tance of his influence over the major, ut|tered, or rather I believe
reflected, the following &s;o|liloquy.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Zounds what an e&s;cape!&mdash;but it is
nothing to a genius like mine. Poor dolt, how gloriou&s;ly I ride him! As to
madam, I fancy &s;he'll tell no more tales. This is reducing things to a
&s;y&s;tem: but I always &s;aid it. To palliate an accu&s;ation, if you take a
man by that foible his genero&s;ity, you are &s;ure to be &s;afe. Men are
always liberal when there is nothing required but words.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But to expedients. This woman is a fool: I had
a &s;cheme to her advantage. Her hu&s;band cannot live long, e&s;pecially as I
drench him, and would &s;he join me, we might make a comfortable thing on't
when once I &s;hould have preached his funeral &s;ermon. Well, if &s;he will
kick down her <PB N="74" REF="107"> ba&s;ket of gla&s;s ware, that is her
bu&s;ine&s;s. I will try her however once more. I am &s;ecure from any
impertinent tattling. The major will hear no more complaints. If &s;he comes
to, I &s;hall be charmed; for, to &s;ay the truth, &s;he is a lovely wo|man: if
not, &s;hall I &s;take my intere&s;t again&s;t her folly? No, not were &s;he a
Venus.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'To-morrow I will begin the attack, and if &s;he
&s;hould not capitulate in a week, I will then appear to rai&s;e the &s;iege;
but it &s;hall be only to prepare a mine, which, when once &s;prung, &s;hall
either de|&s;troy her, or make her pri&s;oner at the mercy of her conqueror: in
which ca&s;e &s;he will not find in me the continence of POMPEY or
ALEXANDER.&mdash;No, no, my bu&s;ine&s;s is to talk of virtue; let fools
practi&s;e it, who are content to take it for their re|ward.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether all or any part of Standfa&s;t's plan was put in
execution will hereafter be &s;een. When he came to the above period, he had
ju&s;t fini&s;hed his meditation and his walk, and having knocked at his door,
was let in by his confidential &s;ervant, who beat Scrub out of &s;ight, in
point of variety in his employments; for as Scrub had one employment for every
day in the week, Mr. Flu&s;h&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;had one for
almo&s;t every day in the year. <PB N="75" REF="108"> Nor, to &s;ay the truth,
was there ever any per&s;on better cut out for a great man's appendage, for I
hope the reader already allows Mr. Standfa&s;t to be a great man; and as to Mr.
Flu&s;h, or Mr. Kiddy Flu&s;h&mdash;for he had al&s;o a nick name&mdash;if a
fork be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a knife, fuel to a fire, a &s;cabbard to a &s;word, a
bucket to a well, a bailiff to an attorney, or a bully to a bawd, the
&s;ervices of that faithful ad|herent were e&s;&s;entially material and
ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to his worthy principal: nay I que&s;tion if Kiddy
was not very near, if not altogether as great an original as his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>As, however, my opinion is of very little con&s;e|quence if my
good reader does not coincide with it, I think it ab&s;olutely incumbent on me
to delineate the portrait of the &s;aid Flu&s;h, or Kiddy&mdash;for he was as
often called one as the other&mdash;&s;o let the claim to &s;uperiority re&s;t
either on the &s;ide of the man or ma&s;|ter, as it &s;hall appear by the
drawing; and as it is u&s;ual in portraits to illu&s;trate the character by
&s;ome cymbolical ornament, through the means of which you can lay your finger
on the canvas and &s;ay this is a general, for he has a truncheon in his hand,
and this a butcher, for he has a no&s;egay in his bo&s;om, &s;o will I give the
like infallible traits to know the characteri&s;tic marks of Kiddy's mo&s;t
&s;triking qua|lities.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="109"> As to his per&s;on, it was, for his
&s;ize&mdash;for he was only four feet eleven inches high&mdash;the mo&s;t
compact that ever was &s;een; but then, as if nature had been fearful, had
&s;he fini&s;hed the front of this well pro|portioned &s;tructure equal to the
re&s;t of the work, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould have been tempted to have thrown down
her tools in de&s;pair, his face was the mo&s;t &s;in|gular piece of deformity
that can be conceived.</P>
<P>His no&s;e and chin, like the head and tail of a weathercock,
pointed different ways; yet not ea&s;t and we&s;t, nor north and &s;outh, but
to the zenith and nadir.</P>
<P>Some were of opinion that he had no mouth when he was born, but
that the operator had made an inci&s;ion to &s;erve for one; and that being in
a hurry, and his &s;ci&s;&s;ors none of the &s;harpe&s;t, he had not only cut
it in an oblique direction, from the right &s;ide of the under jaw up to the
left cheek bone, but al&s;o zig zag; &s;o that when he laughed&mdash;indeed
laugh he never did&mdash;but when he grinned&mdash;for his teeth were pretty
even, which lends probability to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the inci&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>But pray excu&s;e me from relating how he looked when he
grinned, till I have de&s;cribed his eyes; one of which, the left, was
&s;maller than the other, and <PB N="77" REF="110"> whether it envied the
&s;uperior &s;ize of its neighbour, or was awed by con&s;cious humility at its
own in&s;ig|nificance, I really cannot &s;ay, but it fairly &s;lunk into the
oppo&s;ite corner, without even deigning, or perhaps daring, to ca&s;t one
&s;ingle glance to the right, while the other, in triumphant pride, rolled, or
ra|ther goggled about, and appeared it&s;elf an Argus, looking a hundred ways
at once.</P>
<P>To the&s;e unlovely marks&mdash;which in females are called
certificates for their hone&s;ty&mdash;I mu&s;t add that Kiddy was frightfully
&s;eamed with the &s;mall pox, and that he received no addition in point of
beauty from an explo&s;ion of gunpowder when he was abroad, which &s;tript the
&s;kin off his face, except on a &s;mall part of one of his cheeks, and one or
two other places; and thereby left &s;uch a violent redne&s;s for ever after,
that his face looked &s;omething like a rump &s;teak, or rather like red ochre
in the grinding, in which, if you take up the muller, you may &s;ee an
appearance like branches of trees, which an&s;wers exactly to &s;eams of the
&s;mall pox; or, to add one more &s;imile, which &s;hall take in beard and
all&mdash;for his beard, like that of Hudibras, was orange tawny&mdash;his
complexion was like a red wine &s;yllabub, where here and there appears a
&s;plotch of white curd, the whole gently tinged with a &s;prinkling of
nutmeg.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="111"> As to the grinning, after I have &s;aid
&s;o much, I think I &s;hould affront the reader by de&s;cribing it. He knows
every feature now as well as I do, and if he chu&s;es to call up a grin in his
imagination, and when he has &s;o done, does not grin him&s;elf, I can only
&s;ay he is not the reader I took him for.</P>
<P>Kiddy Flu&s;h had been employed from his youth up to beat the
drum, di&s;tribute the bills, and &s;lang the figures of a puppet &s;hew, where
he had learnt a &s;mattering of every thing. He could &s;crape the fid|dle,
vault on the &s;lack wire, &s;wear a good round hand, coax the girls, get
boozy, and I am afraid thieve; for if he had not this la&s;t qualification, I
cannot &s;ee why they &s;hould &s;end him hand-cuffed, which they really did,
on board a tran&s;port who&s;e de&s;tination was to the American
plantations.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, not to conceal the di&s;grace, Kiddy was certainly
tran&s;ported to America; from whence he contrived to get re-tran&s;ported to
Ireland. There he found means to get engaged as a drummer in the &s;ame
regiment where Standfa&s;t was chaplain. In|deed Kiddy Flu&s;h was the very
per&s;on who taught Tiger Standfa&s;t to beat that reveille, which has been
already celebrated as a <HI>chef d'oeuvre.</HI></P>
<P>Were I to run through all the &s;cenes &s;o full of 
<PB N="79" REF="112"> &s;rolic, whim, di&s;&s;ipation, and &s;ingular
di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, which were practi&s;ed by this trim tram, this hor&s;e and
his rider, I might as well at once have given the world the adventures of Tiger
Standfa&s;t and his man Kiddy; but as that is not totally my intention, I
&s;hall content my&s;elf with noticing that the&s;e worthy a&s;&s;ociates,
finding them&s;elves very nece&s;&s;ary to each other, a league was entered
into between them, that mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be given&mdash;to put
the matter a little technically&mdash;in all breezes, fri&s;ks, plots,
queerings, tricks, humbugs, and bambouzlings, that they might find it expedient
to engage in; that the agreement &s;hould be under&s;tood as a partner&s;hip
between them, with this &s;ole di&s;tinction, that Flu&s;h &s;hould be openly
con&s;idered as a &s;ervant, and in that character be kept in &s;ubordination
before company, but permitted to &s;peak his mind freely, openly, and without
re&s;erve when nobody &s;hould be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Kiddy Flu&s;h, at the time of his fir&s;t introduction to the
reader&mdash;for nothing is &s;o advantageous as to bring on your principal
characters with a good grace,&mdash;was what is called half gone; in his own
language a little cocki&s;h: for I mu&s;t tell the reader&mdash;and that is
really the la&s;t explanation I will trouble him with about Kiddy&mdash;that,
among the re&s;t of his oddities, his choice of words was the mo&s;t
&s;ingular. It was compo&s;ed of the cant terms of both his profe&s;&s;ions, 
<PB N="80" REF="113"> to which he occa&s;ionally added a mi&s;erable pun, and
now and then a little bad French, which he had picked up on his travels; the
whole interlarded with new-fangled oaths.</P>
<P>Kiddy had ju&s;t been witne&s;s to a curious &s;cene in the
village, and was bur&s;ting to di&s;clo&s;e it to his ma&s;ter on his arrival.
At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be remembered that Standfa&s;t's head was entirely
filled with what had pa&s;&s;ed at the major's.</P>
<P>Kiddy then &s;carcely &s;uffered his ma&s;ter to &s;it down
before he began with 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;ay ma&s;ter, there has been rum gig going
forward this evening.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Gig, what do you mean?' &s;aid Standfa&s;t:</Q>
his mind &s;till running on his late adventure. 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay nothing,' &s;aid Flu&s;h, 'no rang, only we
had like to have come off with tats, that's all. Shiver me if we had not been
cute, we &s;hould &s;ome of us have taken a leap without nobody to hold the
blanket.'</Q></P>
<P>Standfa&s;t thinking he alluded to the &s;crape he had &s;o
narrowly got out of, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">'why how the devil came you to know any thing
about it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why Lord love you,' &s;aid Kiddy, 'I know the
whole manoeuvre of the thing, and I mu&s;t &s;ay it was bunglingly
managed.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Bunglingly!' &s;aid Stand|fa&s;t; 'dam'me if I
think any man in the world <PB N="81" REF="114"> ever drew him&s;elf out of
&s;uch a hobble with half &s;o much grace. To have them both upon me, the old
&s;oldier and his wife!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why ma&s;ter, what are you upon?' &s;aid
Flu&s;h. 'The jon&s;e I means ben't no old &s;oldiers, nor their wives; but a
parcel of &s;heep biting poltroons&mdash;flats&mdash;mazards&mdash;who,
in&s;tead of pelting it out like hearties, &s;neaked away to the boozing
ca&s;es, and left the enemy ma&s;ters of the champ of battle.'</Q></P>
<P>He here acquainted Standfa&s;t that, at the moment of exhibiting
the effigy of the vicar on its funeral pile, a party of heroes from
Ca&s;tlewick, who had heard from the clerk and the &s;choolma&s;ter of the
in|dignity intended to be offered to their worthy pa&s;tor, ru&s;hed in,
&s;aved tho&s;e precious relics from the flames, and bore them off in triumph;
while the affrighted Hockleymen fled amazed, &s;carcely offer|ing to
re&s;i&s;t:&mdash;and it was well they did, for the vi|car's adherents would
have died on the &s;pot rather than have yielded.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'However,' &s;aid Flu&s;h, 'for the honour of
the cau&s;e I rallied the &s;cums, and &s;poke a &s;peech to them, as near as I
can remember, in the&s;e um here words.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="115"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Says I&mdash;Splinter your joints, what are you

however, this here I will &s;ay&mdash;you had no maulers, and they took you by

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh very great indeed, General Flu&s;h,'
returned Standfa&s;t. 'What effect had it?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Effect!' ex|claimed Flu&s;h, 'Dam'me it took
like a train. In an hour the kallenge was &s;ent, a categorical re|turned, and
to-morrow at five we beat to arms.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Bravo!' cried Standfa&s;t; 'but remember I know
nothing of this. Stay, a thought &s;trikes me: I can make this matter of u&s;e:

<P>The ma&s;ter and man here parted; the one went to &s;nooze, as
he called it, and the other to meditate how he could make this accident of
advantage to him.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, if the reader plea&s;e, we will leave them,
and return to the major's, late as it is; as I am anxious to make known what
pa&s;&s;ed in the mind of Mrs. Malplaquet, after &s;he retired to her
appart|ment.</P>
<P>That lady had a mo&s;t faithful and hone&s;t friend in her
handmaid Emma, who was almo&s;t as &s;ingular a character as Flu&s;h, though a
perfect contra&s;t, for nothing in nature could be more harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>Emma was the daughter of a book&s;eller in Lon|don, who having a
large family, and being in no very flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, was prevailed
on to put her out as a lady's companion. An advantage|ous recommendation
brought her into the care of Mrs. Malplaquet, where &s;he had been now retained
for almo&s;t three years; in which time &s;he had made her&s;elf &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o agreeable to her lady, that <PB N="84" REF="117">
nothing I believe could have prevailed on her to part with &s;o valuable an
acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>What made her company &s;o particularly de&s;ir|able, was the
a&s;toni&s;hing fund of information &s;he had trea&s;ured up, by &s;itting in
her father's &s;hop. Her mind was a kind of circulating library in little, and
I &s;incerely wi&s;h romances were always attended with the &s;ame good effects
they produced in her; for there is &s;carcely a good moral inculcated by them
that &s;he did not act up to. Not that &s;he had not formed a decided opinion
of writings as well as writers; but &s;he rarely broached that opinion,
think|ing with Madam DACIER that &s;ilence was the be&s;t ornament of the
female &s;ex. It was evident, how|ever, that it was wi&s;ely and judiciou&s;ly
cho&s;en, for at the head of her favourite authors &s;he placed Dr. JOHNSON;
though I rather think her great admira|tion of him mu&s;t have been as a
critic, for the Doc|tor is known to have entertained a rooted di&s;like to
mythology, and indeed every figurative writing which does not &s;quare with
what he calls truth and morality; whereas Emma maintained that morality being
the noble&s;t drift of literature, tho&s;e writings were the mo&s;t perfect
which brought virtue into dan|ger, that &s;he might ri&s;e the more triumphant;
and that &s;uch productions received an additional force and beauty from

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE HISTORIAN FULFILS HIS PROMISE TO THE READER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE challenge from the Hockleymen having been, as Mr. Flu&s;h
informed us, accepted by the Ca&s;tle|wickites, a large plain, known by the
name of the cricket green, &s;ituated near the high road, about midway between
the two villages, was pitched upon for the &s;cene of action. Thither repaired
the com|batants; and there were they drawn up in battle ar|ray, every man
poi&s;ing his hedge&s;take, when a gen|tleman in a po&s;t chai&s;e and four,
who had ordered the po&s;tilion to mend his pace, when he fir&s;t &s;aw a mob
a&s;&s;embled, came up, and cried out in a pretty authoritative voice, that if
the inhabitants of Ca&s;tle|wick did not de&s;i&s;t, they &s;hould lo&s;e his
favour for ever.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tlewickites expected a very different word of command.
Finding however their pre&s;ent ge|neral to be no other than Sir Sidney, they
thought proper to throw down what Mr. Flu&s;h called mau|lers. Upon this the
Hockley men began to &s;pring <PB N="89" REF="122"> forward with an exulting
&s;hout and would have dealt death among their unarmed enemies had not another
authoritative voice commanded a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities on their
part.</P>
<P>This voice proceeded from no le&s;s a per&s;on than Mr. Flu&s;h,
who having deliberately weighed the probable con&s;equence of &s;uch violent
proceedings, began to think they would not be altogether &s;o con|&s;i&s;tent
with prudence. He con&s;idered that the quar|rel had originated with
Standfa&s;t, and that there would be enough to do, without this new outrage, to
&s;et matters to rights about the vicar. It was therefore his bu&s;ine&s;s, in
quality of his ma&s;ter's friend&mdash;by means of which he knew he &s;hould be
al&s;o his own&mdash;to &s;often matters; and having an ex|cellent opportunity,
owing to this piece of cowar|dice on the part of his adherents, he holloed out,
as loud as his &s;hrill pipe would permit him&mdash;</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why, pink your livers, what are going for to
do? Would ye, &s;tiffen your timbers, go for to be &s;uch poltroons as to
bru&s;h the jackets of a parcel of naked men! Don't you &s;ee they have canted
away their whackers?'</Q></P>
<P>Then &s;peaking in a lower tone to his lieutenant
general&mdash;&s;aid he 
<Q REND="inline">'The &s;hew is over, we mu&s;t let 
<PB N="90" REF="123"> down the rug: &s;o do you parley to the hearties, while I
palaver the old rum kid yonder.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this he came up to Sir Sidney, and was be|ginning to
&s;tate the ca&s;e in a very advantageous way to his ma&s;ter and him&s;elf,
when their attention was drawn off by a violent &s;creaming at a &s;hort
di&s;tance. Directing their eyes to where the &s;ound proceeded from, they
&s;aw a coach overturned, to which Sir Sidney ran, and was indeed followed by
the whole mob, friends and enemies.</P>
<P>The coach belonged to Major Malplaquet, and there were in it, at
the time of this accident, that gentleman, his lady, and the reverend Mr.
Standfa&s;t. Neither the lady nor the curate received any mate|rial injury, but
the major's head had pitched again&s;t a ragged &s;tone, by which means his
&s;kull was dan|gerou&s;ly fractured.</P>
<P>The combatants, their cau&s;e of quarrel, and every other
con&s;ideration was now ab&s;orbed in this me|lancholy accident.</P>
<P>The major was with difficulty li&s;ted into his coach, where Sir
Sidney, who had never &s;een him before, offered to accompany him; recommending
his chai&s;e to Mrs. Malplaquet, into which Mr. <PB N="91" REF="124">
Standfa&s;t very politely offered to accompany her, with a view, as he &s;aid,
of keeping up her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The lady however thought proper to refu&s;e both offers, and
in&s;i&s;ted upon going with her hu&s;band. She, however, did not neglect to
thank Sir Sidney with tears for his kind concern, which indeed was as
manife&s;t as if the wounded per&s;on had been his own brother; for he had by
this time di&s;patched three &s;ervants to different &s;urgeons. Not but Mr.
Standfa&s;t appeared in &s;ome concern too, but the glances he ca&s;t at the
lady, and the opera tune he &s;oftly whi&s;tled while he a&s;&s;i&s;ted his
dying patron, pretty well evinced that his mind ran rather upon the future than
the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney would not leave the major a moment, but &s;upported
him in the coach with the utmo&s;t care and tenderne&s;s all the way home,
where by the time they arrived, and the major was put to bed, arrived al&s;o
two of the &s;urgeons, who agreed that the ma|jor had not many hours to live.
They however bled him, prepared bandages, and one of them be|gan to prepare for
the operation of the trepan: re|&s;olved that their patient &s;hould go out of
the world <HI>&s;ecundum artem.</HI> They were, however, di&s;appoint|ed; for
falling into a delirium, he erupted a blood <PB N="92" REF="125">
ve&s;&s;el&mdash;which one of the &s;urgeons very judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved
mu&s;t have been injured by the fall&mdash;and was in&s;tantly
&s;uffocated.</P>
<P>Mrs. Malplaquet did not faint away, nor even go into
hy&s;terics, upon this occa&s;ion: &s;he felt however very &s;everely. It is
true her tears did not prevent her from thanking Sir Sidney; on the contrary
&s;he acknowledged his &s;ingular goodne&s;s in terms of the mo&s;t lively
gratitude; yet her grief, though it ap|peared only decent and proper, was from
the heart. She, no more than the vicar, would have wi&s;hed the de&s;truction
of the vile&s;t reptile; and though &s;he never regarded the major with the
ardour of love, yet he had ever been kind, and &s;he grateful.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over the funeral, at which Sir Sidney, by a
particular invitation from Mrs. Malplaquet, was pre&s;ent, and only &s;ay that
when all proper ce|remonies and decent &s;olemnities were over, the wi|dow,
after paying &s;ome legacies&mdash;the principal of which was three thou&s;and
pounds to the Reverend Mr. Standfa&s;t, as a trifling acknowledgment of his
di&s;intere&s;ted and honourable attachment&mdash;for the chaplain had
frequently hinted that if a man left any thing to a friend, it had better be in
money, which would prevent litigation. The widow, I &s;ay, after 
<PB N="93" REF="126"> di&s;charging the&s;e obligations, found her&s;elf in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a plentiful fortune.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance, however, I mu&s;t not fail to mention, which
is that Mr. Mildman, at the de&s;ire of Mrs. Malplaquet, preached the funeral
&s;ermon. Nor can I avoid noticing that Sir Sidney furni&s;hed the epitaph,
which was no more than what follows: 
<Q> HERE are depo&s;ited the Remains of <LB>MAJOR MALPLAQUET,
<LB>Who feared his Maker, <LB>Served his Country, <LB>And left a grateful Widow
to lament his Death, <LB>And celebrate his inferior Virtues. <LB>He died March
the 1&s;t, 1751. <LB>Aged 71 Years.</Q></P>
<P>This epitaph Emma declared to be perfect in all its
requi&s;ites; for it told who was the per&s;on buried, and very conci&s;ely
pointed out his good qualities: you al&s;o learnt by it when he died, and how
old he was. Nay, &s;o much was &s;he plea&s;ed, that &s;he doubted not, if it
had been written in latin, but that Dr. JOHNSON him&s;elf mu&s;t have been
perfectly content with it. For her part, &s;he liked it as well as it was; and
that for a very good rea&s;on, as &s;he humbly conceived, namely, becau&s;e
&s;he did not un|der&s;tand <PB N="94" REF="127"> latin. Indeed &s;he owned
that this was one of the &s;pots that candour obliged her to acknow|ledge were
now and then to be di&s;covered in the doctor. He was very angry that Dr.
SMOLLET's epitaph was not written in latin; and when he went into an
apothecary's &s;hop with Mr. BOSWELL, in|&s;tead of a&s;king for &s;ome
trifling medicine he had oc|ca&s;ion, for, he called for paper, pen, and ink,
and wrote it down in latin.</P>
<P>The&s;e manners and opinions &s;he thought&mdash;for nobody was
&s;o open to conviction as Emma&mdash;were upon erudition what ru&s;t is upon a
coin, which no one knows the value of but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Nothing could be &s;o clear, &s;he &s;aid, as what &s;he
advanced. It was not every body's lot to be ble&s;t with &s;o much learning as
the doctor, which &s;he maintained was very fortunate; for if all men were
arrived at &s;uch perfection as him&s;elf, and were able like him of advancing
incontrovertible <HI>ip&s;e dixits,</HI> argument would be at an end, and of
cour&s;e litera|ture along with it. But, as he was the only one who had ever
pretended to be infallible, and who cer|tainly was &s;o, except in a few
trifling points like this, it might &s;o happen that latin epitaphs would prove
a &s;arca&s;m where they were meant to be a pa|negyric; for to prai&s;e a dead
per&s;on in a language <PB N="95" REF="128"> he was unacquainted with while
living, though a tacit, would be a very &s;trong &s;atire; be&s;ides being a
cruel inconvenience to his family, who mu&s;t, in this ca&s;e, be obliged to
get the par&s;on to con&s;true the virtues of the decea&s;ed, who, after all,
perhaps might not be able to do it off hand. She therefore clearly apprehended,
that as Dr. JOHNSON had i&s;|&s;ued a literary bill, enacting that an epitaph
could not be perfect which did not mention the particu|lars before rehear&s;ed,
the next infallible writer&mdash;if ever this country &s;hould be ble&s;t with
another, &s;hould be petitioned to move, by way of rider, that, for the benefit
of the public in general, all &s;uch epi|taphs &s;hould be done in Engli&s;h. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' &s;aid &s;he, fini&s;hing her harrangue,
'dear Doctor JOHNSON put me in mind at la&s;t of DOMITIUS AFER, who would be an
orator when he could no longer be audible, and of whom QUINTILIAN &s;aid that
he would rather &s;ail than de&s;i&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>It is now high time I &s;hould account for that &s;trange jumble
of accidents which, in &s;o &s;hort a time, &s;aved an hundred men from bodily
hurt, and yet killed another, who had no concern at all in the fray.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that Standfa&s;t had a &s;cheme in
agitation. It was this: He knew Mrs. <PB N="96" REF="129"> Malplaquet to be of
a mo&s;t tender and compa&s;&s;ionate temper, and he thought he could wound her
through this weak &s;ide. He had therefore lured the major and her out, by way
of an afternoon's ride, intend|ing, when they arrived at the field of battle,
to ex|claim again&s;t the barbarity of the di&s;putants, to jump out of the
carriage, and to in&s;i&s;t on their going peaceably home.</P>
<P>This he thought the lady would take in &s;uch a light as mu&s;t
greatly forward his de&s;igns. The con|templation of this &s;cheme on his
&s;ide, and the hopes of detecting him on the &s;ide of Mrs. Malplaquet, made
them, on that afternoon, better &s;atisfied with each other than they had been
a long time, and gave the major &s;uch real plea&s;ure, that he declared, as
they were in the carriage, that he never pa&s;&s;ed &s;o happy a day in his
life, without divining, poor man, that it would be his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t's kind intentions were, however, fore&s;talled
by Sir Sidney, who, through an unex|pected di&s;&s;olution of parliament, was
po&s;ting down to be recho&s;en for the borough of Neither&s;ide.</P>
<P>Thus are men &s;aved or de&s;troyed by the turn of a &s;traw.
Thus the villagers &s;lept in whole &s;kins: thus the major was hurried into
the other world: thus <PB N="97" REF="130"> were the de&s;igns of Mr.
Standfa&s;t fru&s;trated: and thus&mdash;for I cannot longer refrain from
declaring it&mdash;did Sir Sidney &s;ee that phantom we formerly &s;poke of:
that di&s;turber of his peace, to whom he longed to open his mind.</P>
<P>This is the &s;ecret I hinted to the reader at the end of the
&s;ixth chapter, and I only de&s;ire to be re&s;olved, had I then divulged
it&mdash;and thereby have neglected to bring him acquainted with the
heartburnings of the two villages, the contra&s;t between the two par|&s;ons,
the &s;ingular friend&s;hip of Standfa&s;t and the major, the amiable ca&s;t of
Mrs. Malplaquet, the ex|traordinary qualities of her maid, the wonderful and
&s;urpri&s;ing talents of Mr. Flu&s;h, and every other per&s;on or thing that
conduced to bring about that event which introduced Sir Sidney to Mrs.
Malpla|quet&mdash;whether it would not have been doing things in a bungling and
unworkmanlike manner?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides I have now no further trouble with the&s;e people; the
reader is perfectly acquainted with them, and if, in future, they &s;hould be
thrown in his way, let them &s;peak for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure had they never appeared at all, Sir Sidney might
have been heart-whole; but &s;ince a number of circum&s;tances are likely to
grow out of <PB N="98" REF="131"> this accidental interview, I have even given
it as it happened; and &s;hall now tell the reader when time had fully
confirmed the baronet in his fir&s;t opi|nion of the widow, that &s;he was a
very hand&s;ome, and, what was more to him, a very valuable wo|man, he
re&s;olved to throw his fortune into her lap, and his per&s;on into her arms:
and for this purpo&s;e he was determined to make her a propo&s;al to that
effect as &s;oon as decency &s;hould permit it.</P>
<P>Several rea&s;ons urged him to this: fir&s;t, there was a
&s;ecret, which, to make amends for my late tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be
almo&s;t immediately di&s;clo&s;ed to the reader.</P>
<P>Perhaps my readine&s;s to indulge him may be at|tributed to
malevolence; becau&s;e, in doing &s;o, I &s;hall be obliged to &s;hew a &s;peck
in the character of Sir Sidney, which to &s;ome may appear black, place it in
what light I will. To this accu&s;ation, however, I plead not guilty;
&s;olemnly declaring, that, in the mo&s;t unrighteous moments of his life, I
truly be|lieve he had as rea&s;onable a &s;tock of piety as any bi&s;hop would
de&s;ire; as much temperance, &s;ober|ne&s;s, and cha&s;tity, even in his very
exce&s;&s;es, as a gouty alderman under a regimen; and, at any rate, as little
de&s;ire of doing an injury to man, woman, or child as a Lord Chancellor.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="132"> This however need not hinder the reader
from exerci&s;ing his own judgment, which I not only de|&s;ire he may do, but
al&s;o with the mo&s;t critical care and nicety; and when all the
circum&s;tances, dan|gers, temptations, motives, and inducements, are clearly
and fairly examined, if he &s;hould not acquit Sir Sidney of every thing
wor&s;e than venial frailty, I mu&s;t hone&s;tly take &s;hame to my&s;elf for
having palmed on the world, as an exemplary character, a mere mortal, made up
of fle&s;h and blood, and &s;ub|ject to wi&s;hes, inclinations, and de&s;ires,
like other men.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay certainly that the very excellence of Sir Sidney's
heart &s;prung from having as vigorous and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions as any rake
in chri&s;tendom, and never having improperly given them the reins, but once,
in his life. But &s;ome of my readers may think that once too much. And as a
blot at back|gammon is no blot till it is hit, and a blot of ink is the
ea&s;ier di&s;coverable in proportion to the whitene&s;s of the paper on which
it falls; and as an atom is not only magnified, but more deformed, by being
&s;een through a micro&s;cope, &s;o I fear this one fault will intrude it&s;elf
on the reader's remembrance, in the very act of relieving di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
genius, or wiping a tear from the cheek of an orphan. If it &s;hould be 
<PB N="100" REF="133"> &s;o, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit; for a reader, like a pope, is
in|fallible, and from his fiat there is no appeal.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Sir Sidney's incontinence&mdash;for in|continence
it was, and &s;uch things, like murder, will out&mdash;&s;hall be told in the
next chapter, which will fini&s;h the fir&s;t book of this hi&s;tory; and while
the reader takes time to con&s;ider what heinous crime this can po&s;&s;ibly
be, let me be&s;peak his charity by informing him that Sir Sidney being once
foreman of a grand jury, whom the judge recommended to find a bill again&s;t a
murderer, becau&s;e, as he &s;aid, &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances were,
which could not have been yet proved, an&s;wered with an hone&s;t

<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHICH CONTAINS THE TRIAL OF SIR SIDNEY&mdash;THE PLEAD|INGS ON
BOTH SIDES&mdash;THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE&mdash;AND FINISHES THE FIRST BOOK OF
THIS HISTORY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE are now going to enter upon action, every thing already
related having happened previous to the time when the reader and I entered the
rookery; or, as Mr. Bayes has it, long before the beginning of this play. We
there left Sir Sidney apparently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every comfort upon earth,
and yet un|happy. This &s;eeming paradox has been partly ac|counted for; but
let us hope, as Mrs. Malplaquet is now entirely mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf, that
the bar to the completion of the baronet's wi&s;hes may be re|moved.</P>
<P>The major has now been dead nearly a twelve-month, and Sir
Sidney has had many opportunities of confirming him&s;elf in the good opinion
he origi|nally entertained of the widow; but as, at his time of life, marriage
was no maygame, he hone&s;tly &s;o|licited to be acquainted with every &s;ecret
of her <PB N="102" REF="135"> heart, frankly offering to encourage her by
laying open the exact &s;ituation of his own.</P>
<P>Mrs. Malplaquet liked the propo&s;al &s;o well, that &s;he did
not he&s;itate to give him every information concerning her&s;elf, which I
formerly gave the rea|der; not forgetting to own, with an ingenuous
frankne&s;s, that &s;he had loved before; and though, were &s;he to form a
character, &s;he knew of no qua|lity &s;he would wi&s;h to make a part of it
that Sir Sid|ney did not perfectly po&s;&s;e&s;s, yet that warmth of af|fection
which &s;he had formerly cheri&s;hed would ne|ver again, &s;he &s;incerely
believed, take place in her heart.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney &s;carcely heard her to an end, when he
exclaimed&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam, in opening my own heart, I &s;hould have
u&s;ed the very &s;ame words. I have loved, and will imitate you by
confe&s;&s;ing that the object of my affection, whether alive or dead, is
&s;till dear to me. Your re&s;emblance of her fir&s;t induced my admiration of
you, and the con&s;onance of your &s;entiments with hers, in&s;pired me with an
e&s;teem of the true&s;t kind, which perhaps, in marriage, more &s;ecurely
en&s;ures happine&s;s than what is generally called love.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'To con&s;ide in your tender bo&s;om the
&s;ecret of <PB N="103" REF="136"> my pa&s;&s;ion is now my duty, and if you
will have the patience to hear me, I &s;hall &s;hew you that tho&s;e who are
capable of mo&s;t tenderne&s;s, are effectively the lea&s;t happy:&mdash;but,
as old AESOP &s;aid when Prometheus took the clay to form man, he tem|pered it
with tears.'</Q></P>
<P>The lady te&s;tified great impatience, and the ba|ronet
proceeded to &s;atisfy her in the following words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Being about ten years ago in the &s;outh of
France, I became acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Le Clerc. He had a
daughter, who, at the time I fir&s;t vi&s;ited in the family, was ju&s;t come
home from a convent. Conver&s;ations between French and Engli&s;h too often
turn on the &s;ubject of religion. As to Mr. Le Clerc, he was not &s;a|tisfied
with continually chanting forth the prai&s;es of that only and exclu&s;ive
wor&s;hip, which, accord|ing to him, would procure &s;alvation, but he daily

by renouncing his acquaintance, or removing to ano|ther town: but I had no

&s;he loved. Yes madam, plain, downright, and &s;incere as I was, a beautiful
girl of nineteen, gentle as a che|rub, and good as an angel, doated on me. Nor
was I behind hand with her, I promi&s;e you; for my affection was exactly of
that &s;ort which receives its plea&s;ure by reflecting what it has
given.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This was the charm that withheld me. We
con&s;ulted together on the mo&s;t expedient means to gratify our mutual
wi&s;hes, and though I dreaded the event, it was re&s;olved that I &s;hould

he heard me to an end, and then very explicitly informed me that he would
con&s;ent to my marriage with his daughter upon condition I changed my

prevent her from throwing her&s;elf into the arms of a heretic.</Q></P>

<Q REND="inline">'I had &s;carcely returned to my lodgings, to
re|flect on this adventure, and the mea&s;ures I ought to take in con&s;equence
of it, when my &s;ervant came running to tell me that a po&s;t chai&s;e was
waiting at the door, with a lady in it, who de&s;ired to &s;ee me immediately.
Gue&s;s what was my &s;ur|prize when I beheld my Annette, who told me in as few
words as po&s;&s;ible that her father was at that moment gone to the abbe&s;s
of a certain convent, to agree to her entire exclu&s;ion from the world; that
&s;he had cho&s;en the moment of his ab&s;ence to come to me; and knowing how
much my mind was above the fal&s;e delicacy of &s;acrificing to ridi|culous
form and unnece&s;&s;ary ceremony, &s;he pro|po&s;ed at once going off for
&s;ome town where we might be married in the prote&s;tant faith.</Q></P>

twenty leagues on our road to Geneva, when poor <PB N="106" REF="139"> Annette
was taken &s;o very ill that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to proceed.</Q></P>
<P>

my&s;elf lamentably mi&s;taken; her di&s;order encrea&s;ed, and I was greatly
alarmed for her life. By degrees, however, &s;he recovered, and though very
weak, we apprehended no more dangerous &s;ymptoms.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'During all this time as we were thrown among a
parcel of boors, I was obliged to give her every attendance I decently could.
This attention pro|cured &s;o free and uninterrupted an intercour&s;e be|tween
us, that is it wonderful when the ro&s;e be|gan to revi&s;it her cheeks, and my
whole &s;oul was in a trance of happine&s;s at the pro&s;pect of retriev|ing an
ine&s;timable trea&s;ure that, a few days before, I had dreaded to lo&s;e for
ever:&mdash;Is it wonderful thus unre&s;trained, con&s;idering our&s;elves as
man and wife, we became &s;o by every tie but the cere|mony. I will not comment
on the circum&s;tance: perhaps it was inexcu&s;able: perhaps I ought not to
have di&s;clo&s;ed it: but nothing could be purer than our intentions were, and
I have no opinion of &s;ecrets which are revealed after marriage.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="140"> Mrs. Malplaquet&mdash;which I think was
very hand|&s;ome in her&mdash;&s;carcely called it a fault, becau&s;e of the
peculiarity of their &s;ituation, and their intention of &s;etting matters
honourably to rights. Nay &s;he undertook to defend the conduct of the lady; at
which Sir Sidney was &s;o greatly charmed, that he &s;ung forth very lavi&s;hly
in prai&s;e of the widow's ge|nero&s;ity, liberality, and candour; and declared
that, except now and then a &s;igh to the memory of An|nette, he &s;hould never
have an intruding care.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well madam,' returned the baronet, 'three weeks
pa&s;&s;ed in plea&s;ures which it is not in my power to de&s;cribe. At the end
of this time, my Annette having recovered &s;ufficient &s;trength to undergo
the fatigue of her journey, we &s;et out for Geneva; but &s;carcely had we got
within a league and a half of tho&s;e frontiers where, by exerci&s;ing the
right of a hu&s;band, I could have &s;ilenced the preten&s;ions of a father,
when being overtaken by a po&s;&s;e of hor&s;emen, headed by Le Clerc, my
Annette was torn from me, while I was over|powered, and carried before the
general of the police of the neighbouring town.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'This gentleman heard my &s;tory to an end;
laughed at my folly for not getting &s;ooner out of danger; took a hand&s;ome
pre&s;ent of me; and gave <PB N="108" REF="141"> me a letter to the father of
Annette: advi&s;ing him to make up the breach, by con&s;enting to our
mar|riage.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;carcely gave my&s;elf time for &s;leep, or
any other refre&s;hment, before I threw my&s;elf at the feet of Mr. Le Clerc. I
got nothing from him however but a volley of reproaches; to which I an&s;wered
that his daughter was affianced to me, that I con&s;idered her as my wife, and
would em|ploy my whole fortune, as well as the intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h
emba&s;&s;ador, who was my particular friend, to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Every argument procured me a new in&s;ult; I
therefore went to Paris for the purpo&s;e of con|&s;ulting my friend, the
emba&s;&s;ador; but, as we were then upon the eve of a war, and he expected
every moment to be recalled, it was out of his power to do me any
&s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus di&s;appointed, I returned once more to
Provence. There I found Le Clerc ten times more furious than ever. He loaded me
with a thou&s;and invectives. It had it &s;eems been found out that Annette was
with child, and he &s;wore he would rather &s;ee her expire than that &s;he
&s;hould bring a heretic into the world. Vainly I repre|&s;ented 
<PB N="109" REF="142"> to him that he was now compelled, by every motive of
honour and ju&s;tice, to make us one. He vowed my de&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'After hovering about the place for a
con&s;idera|ble while&mdash;employing every emi&s;&s;ary my pur&s;e could
procure, to trace out where they had &s;e|que&s;tered Annette&mdash;and having
learnt no more than that &s;he was admitted into a convent at a con|&s;iderable
di&s;tance till &s;he &s;hould lie in, upon con|dition of taking the veil
immediately afterwards, I was mu&s;ing one day what further cour&s;e to
pur|&s;ue, when my &s;ervant came running in, with the greate&s;t horror
pictured in his countenance, and told me if I did not immediately fly, I
&s;hould be impri&s;oned for life, for that his dear lady&mdash;&s;o he always
called Annette&mdash;had died in childbed, after bringing forth a girl, and
that her father, out of revenge, had procured a <HI>lettre de cachet</HI>
again&s;t my per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Shocked as I was at this fatal news, I did not
however neglect my &s;afety, to which I was not a little prompted by a lively
de&s;ire to &s;uccour the little innocent pledge of our tender affection. I
therefore followed my man through a back field, mounted a hor&s;e of my
own&mdash;for I feared to go <PB N="110" REF="143"> po&s;t&mdash;and made the

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'On the road my man informed me that the
po&s;|tilion who drove us to the hou&s;e where Annette was taken ill, happened
to &s;et a company down at Provence &s;ome time afterwards, where being told,
among other things, of the bu&s;tle Le Clerc had made in &s;earching after his
daughter to no purpo&s;e, began to be convinced, by putting different
cir|cum&s;tances together, that it mu&s;t be her he had driven in my company:
for it had been explained to him that &s;he had gone off with an Engli&s;h
gentle|man. In hopes, therefore, of a bribe on the other &s;ide, he went to Le
Clerc, confe&s;&s;ed to him where he had taken us, informed him of Annette's
ill|ne&s;s, and a&s;&s;ured him that, as we talked of going to Geneva, if he
could not overtake us, there was a great chance of catching us as we returned,
e&s;|pecially if we went to that hou&s;e; for as we mu&s;t have &s;topt there
&s;ome time, they would, at any rate, be able to give a good account of
us.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Le Clerc did not he&s;itate a moment, but &s;et
out with two friends and a party of the <HI>Marechau&s;e</HI>', who came to the

There they got every intelligence they want|ed, <PB N="111" REF="144"> and
quickening their diligence, they &s;oon over|took us, as I have already
de&s;cribed.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My &s;ervant al&s;o told me that he did not
believe a &s;yllable of Annette's death. His real opinion was that &s;he had
taken the veil, for that it was a very common thing for their friends to give
out, whenever that event took place, that they were dead, to prevent
trouble&s;ome importunity; and in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance it was extremely
probable; be|cau&s;e, could I have found out the convent to which &s;he was
devoted, I &s;hould have left nothing un|tried to &s;hake that vow which I was
&s;ure &s;he never would have taken but by compul&s;ion.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'And for heaven's &s;ake,' &s;aid the widow,
'what is become of the child?'</Q>

you pre&s;erve her?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You &s;hall hear,' &s;aid the baronet.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Having left re&s;pectable connections in
Provence, I received intelligence from thence, that, very &s;oon after I left
France, Le Clerc quitted that part of the kingdom; but they never could hear to
what <PB N="112" REF="145"> place he retired. About two years
afterwards&mdash;no longer apprehending any ill con&s;equences from the
<HI>lettre de cachet&mdash;</HI>I went again to Provence; but, however, had my
journey for my pains.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Three other vi&s;its were made with no better
&s;ucce&s;s. La&s;t year, however, I was more fortu|nate; for I had not been
many days in the town before a nun of the order of St. Clare called at my
friend's hou&s;e, and demanded to &s;peak to me.&mdash;She informed me that her
order being one of tho&s;e which are allowed to have intercour&s;e at certain
times with the world, &s;he was de&s;ired by an ab|be&s;s of another convent to
let me know that my child would be delivered up to me.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You may believe I was charmed with this
intel|ligence. I went with her to the convent, where I enquired very
earne&s;tly for Annette; but they confirmed every thing I had before heard. Nay
I was even &s;hewn her grave, which you may be a&s;|&s;ured I watered with my
tears. In &s;hort, I came away, bringing with me her living model, who I
&s;incerely believe was not out of my arms an hour at a time till my arrival in
Warwick&s;hire.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Your doubts after this &s;ub&s;ided, I
&s;uppo&s;e?' <PB N="113" REF="146"> cried the widow.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot &s;ay they did,' returned the baronet:
'the little creature at this moment talks of Madame Le Clerc, whom &s;he u&s;ed
to call mamma, in a great hou&s;e, like a church. I there|fore think my being
&s;hewn the grave was a reli|gious fraud, invented to deter me from &s;earching
for her in vain.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She is certainly irrecoverably gone, and
there|fore dead to me. No, I &s;hall never forget her, but let me not forget
my&s;elf. Providence per|mitted this &s;eparation perhaps to puni&s;h us for
the crime of having impetuou&s;ly gratified our wi&s;hes before they received
the &s;anction of religion. It is a heavy puni&s;hment, but I will not incur a
greater by repining.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Sir Sidney pau&s;ed. Several parts of his narrative were
recapitulated, and a variety of reflec|tions grew out of them on the
in&s;tability of human expectations. Sir Sidney apologized to Mrs. Mal|plaquet
for having &s;o freely opened his heart to her, and &s;he &s;incerely
a&s;&s;ured him it had con&s;iderably augmented her e&s;teem for him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble the reader with his reply, or her
rejoinder; but only &s;ay, that after a number of <PB N="114" REF="147"> civil
things had pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides, he reminded her that he wanted a mother
for his child, and &s;he, without affectation, at length promi&s;ed to
undertake that ta&s;k.</P>
<P>In a word, &s;he &s;hortly after became Lady Roe|buck, to the
great &s;atisfaction of the baronet, the confu&s;ion of Standfa&s;t, and the
univer&s;al joy of Ca&s;|tlewick.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CLEARING OF THE COURSE, PREPARATORY TO THE NEXT HEAT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>As a variety of circum&s;tances&mdash;many of them very
unexpectedly&mdash;will &s;hortly pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the reader, I think
it nece&s;&s;ary, as far as I may conceive it our mutual intere&s;t, to prepare
him for their reception. Indeed it is my intention to adopt this practice
frequently in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory: not in &s;uch a way however as to
anticipate any thing. Nay I will not promi&s;e that the&s;e explanations
&s;hall always be literally what they &s;eem; for &s;hould I wi&s;h to cover or
di&s;gui&s;e any circum&s;tance till the proper moment of making it known, I
hope he will not be angry if I put him a little upon a fal&s;e 
<PB N="116" REF="149"> &s;cent, by way of exerci&s;e, to get him an appetite to
the real game, when at la&s;t he &s;hall come up with it.</P>
<P>I beg however it may be under&s;tood that the&s;e fal&s;e lights
are not intended unnece&s;&s;arily to lead him a&s;tray. I know this literary
Will o' th' Wi&s;p is often introduced; but I di&s;claim it as an unpar|donable
and impotent attempt at a &s;purious wit, which is really an affront to every
intelligent reader. So much indeed do I hold &s;uch &s;ort of trifling a thing
that ought on no account to be excu&s;ed, that I de&s;ire this work may be
con&s;idered perfect only in proportion as every circum&s;tance, even the
mo&s;t minute and apparently in&s;ignificant, tends to pro|mote the general
effect, and that effect holds out a laudable and improving moral.</P>
<P>We have heard very little of Standfa&s;t &s;ince the death of
Major Malplaquet. This worthy wight, which will be very little doubted, laid
&s;trong &s;iege to the widow; for, as I &s;aid before, &s;he became, at her
hu&s;band's decea&s;e, very wealthy. She, how|ever, having nobody to plea&s;e
but her&s;elf, gave him &s;uch a reception as &s;oon convinced him that his
hopes were like &s;ome of the projects of our late builders&mdash;fair, and
elegantly fini&s;hed in the e&s;timate, but mere &s;keletons in practice.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="150"> Thus di&s;appointed, he pocketed his
trifle, as he called the three thou&s;and pounds, and decamped; contenting
him&s;elf with whi&s;pering that he might very ea&s;ily have married the widow
if he had thought proper, but knowing ones were not to be taken in: that women
who would &s;ip in the time of their fir&s;t hu&s;bands, might ta&s;te when
they got a &s;econd; and that perhaps, had he been fool enough to be caught, he
might have doated too, and &s;o have gotten a lu&s;ty chaplain to help him out,
as &s;omebody el&s;e did.</P>
<P>The&s;e gro&s;s jokes were faithfully retailed by Mr. Flu&s;h.
Not however without a fini&s;h, that if the go|vernor&mdash;meaning
Standfa&s;t&mdash;had braced the drum of matrimony, a certain genteel dapper
cock of an humble &s;ervant of his would not have feared coming in for a
trevally, or &s;o.</P>
<P>I have never told the reader that Mr. Standfa&s;t and Mr. Viney
were very intimate friends; and perhaps he has divined why: if not, he will
pre&s;ently. The fact however was &s;o. They had known each other for &s;everal
years, and indeed upon Viney's being civilly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Lord Hazard's
hou&s;e, he con|&s;ulted Standfa&s;t, whom he well knew to be a per|fect
Machiavel in dome&s;tic politics, upon the like|lie&s;t means to pre&s;erve his
declining intere&s;t in that family.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="151"> The &s;tream of Standfa&s;t's intere&s;t
going, at that time, in another channel, nothing came of the ne|gociation; but
the major being dead, and he ex|pelled from the pre&s;ence of the widow, the
two friends finding them&s;elves in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and that the
intere&s;t of one was the intere&s;t of both, they laid their heads together,
and con&s;idered of the matter in every point of view. At length they agreed
that nothing could &s;o perfectly an&s;wer their &s;everal wi&s;hes as to get
Standfa&s;t into Lord Hazard's family. Take their own words.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'It is &s;uch a damned good &s;cheme,' &s;aid
Stand|fa&s;t, 'that I envy you for thinking on it; but I am devli&s;hly afraid
it is not practicable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are right,' cried Viney, 'let us tread
&s;ure. Go on warily: I know his foibles, that is one thing in our favour.'</Q>

<Q REND="inline">'How is he for a fir&s;t &s;ight attack?' &s;aid
Standfa&s;t.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A very dove,' cried Viney; 'a greenhorn.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That is lucky,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t; 'we have
nothing then to con&s;ider of but the introduction. Does he know any thing of
me?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Only by hear&s;ay,' replied Viney, 'and now I
recollect, what he did hear was to your ad|vantage. Let me &s;ee what was it?
Oh that the major, out of his great friend&s;hip, had left you 
<PB N="119" REF="152"> con&s;iderably; and, in particular, had commanded his
lady on his death bed to take you for her &s;e|cond hu&s;band.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Ridiculous!' cried Standfa&s;t: 'the old fellow
never &s;poke after the accident; and as to the wi|dow, my dear Sir, &s;he was
too peery. No, no, nothing le&s;s than the title of my lady would con|tent
her.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Od&s;o,' &s;aid Viney, 'I wonder at it too. You
u&s;ed to be pretty &s;ure of your mark when the doe was to be &s;truck. Ha,
ha, ha.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True, true,' cried Standfa&s;t, 'but this was
&s;o &s;kitti&s;h, &s;he would have taken more powder and &s;hot, as well as
patience, than I would &s;pare upon any &s;uch doe, were &s;he the
transformation of a godde&s;s. Hang her, let her go. She has enough to &s;ay
again&s;t me; but, if &s;he prattles, we mu&s;t retaliate, right or
wrong.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'That to be &s;ure,' &s;aid Viney 'is but
&s;elf-de|fence: but to our bu&s;ine&s;s. Lord Hazard is now &s;eeking out a
tutor for his favourite Charles, and I own I &s;hould like to gall him there.
Hey my friend, am I not right? There I feel my &s;i&s;ter's injuries.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well hit faith,' cried Standfa&s;t.&mdash;'They
tell me it is a fine mettled boy, I will bring him up well.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="153"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not &s;o fa&s;t,' interrupted Viney. 'In the
fir&s;t place, did he know of our intimacy, it would be an immoveable bar to
our de&s;ign; and then he is determined to receive none but an exemplary
cha|racter.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Me again!' exclaimed Standfa&s;t. I will give
him examples of plea&s;ure that might re&s;u&s;citate old Anacreon; that is to
&s;ay, behind his father's back: and le&s;&s;ons of morality, before his face,
that might be heard and approved by li&s;tening an|gels.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But &s;till our intimacy,' &s;aid Viney.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'We mu&s;t get over that,' replied Standfa&s;t.
'Let me &s;ee&mdash;I have it&mdash;can't I introduce my&s;elf to &s;ome family
in town?&mdash;or make my court to any relation of the wife? Zounds, now I
recollect, there is a capital hou&s;e in the city&mdash;Ingot, the
wire-drawer&mdash;where they make me very welcome. Lord Ha|zard occa&s;ionally
banks there. If I can but get recommended to preach two or three charity
&s;er|mons, and afterwards invited to dine with the &s;tewards, the
bu&s;ine&s;s is done. I am &s;ure Mr. In|got is under obligations enow to me;
for I &s;o did up his elder brother, by making him genteel, that, in
con&s;equence of two or three genteel <HI>faux</HI> <PB N="121" REF="154">
<HI>pas,</HI> he at la&s;t genteelly fini&s;hed him&s;elf, by which this
remaining brother got to be head of the firm: and &s;o you &s;ee, Viney, one
good turn de&s;erves ano|ther.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'True, true,' &s;aid Viney.</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aid, &s;o done. Standfa&s;t left a friend to offi|ciate
for him at Little Hockley, and repaired to town, where he &s;o well &s;et his
engines to work, that, in &s;ix months, he not only got introduced to Lord
Hazard, but contrived &s;o to &s;u&s;tain the &s;everal e&s;|&s;ays made on his
di&s;po&s;ition and abilities, that he i&s;&s;ued from that ordeal through
which the reader may remember my lord was determined his &s;on's tutor &s;hould
pa&s;s &s;o perfect, as to fix him&s;elf &s;e|curely in that nobleman's good
opinion; and in|deed&mdash;which I &s;hould not think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et
down, but by way of regularity&mdash;Mr. Standfa&s;t was the very gentleman
introduced to Lady Hazard in the fourth chapter of the fir&s;t book, in quality
of tutor to her &s;on.</P>
<P>If the reader &s;hould wonder how it came to pa&s;s that Lord
Hazard did not know the irregularities of Standfa&s;t, e&s;pecially as one was
curate of Little Hockley, and the other landlord, I mu&s;t inform him that his
lord&s;hip had never vi&s;ited his e&s;tate in Warwick&s;hire but once after
his &s;econd marriage, <PB N="122" REF="155"> but repaired to a villa about
twenty miles from London, which he bought &s;oon after he came of age. Indeed,
as &s;oon as he determined to give over his exce&s;&s;es, Little Hockley was
the la&s;t place upon earth he wi&s;hed to think of. His rents were punc|tually
remitted, and this was all he ever would hear upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Neither his reformation, however, nor this cau|tion altered his
character in the opinion of the vil|lagers; for as the &s;ons and daughters of
Little Hock|ley were many of them of his getting, and the re&s;t very ambitious
to be thought &s;o, they never dreamt that he had any virtues, but remembered
his vices only, glorying in them, and &s;peaking of them in &s;o familiar and
&s;hamele&s;s a manner, as if every meal they ta&s;ted was the &s;weeter for
being garni&s;hed with the bread of di&s;honour.</P>
<P>I will not &s;uppo&s;e my reader to be &s;o inexperi|enced as to
think that Standfa&s;t's views were merely confined to his intention of
becoming the tutor of Charles; nor, on the other hand, will I believe him &s;o
&s;agacious as to di&s;cover what they really were.&mdash;We can &s;carcely
credit that a man of this worthy clergyman's con&s;ummate experience in human
traf|fic had not a material point to carry, e&s;pecially now 
<PB N="123" REF="156"> he was in partner&s;hip with Viney. If it was &s;o it
will certainly come in its proper place, which, un|le&s;s I had a
wi&s;h&mdash;which I really have not&mdash;to de|&s;troy the reader's
plea&s;ure, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be here.</P>
<P>Having fixed Mr. Standfa&s;t in the family of Lord Hazard, we
will now &s;peak of Mr. Flu&s;h. That valiant thumper of parchment having
received a hand&s;ome &s;um and a long le&s;&s;on from his quondam ma&s;ter,
was transferred, through Viney, to the ori|ginal Lady Hazard, now reduced to
Mrs. O'Shock|ne&s;y, and by her again transferred to her &s;on, at college.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o &s;ay that Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y was pre|&s;ent at
one or two of the latter con&s;ultations relative to the grand bu&s;ine&s;s;
nor indeed was Flu&s;h ab&s;o|lutely left out. It was, on the contrary, found
ne|ce&s;&s;ary to let him partially into the matter; for &s;aid he, very
archly, 
<Q REND="inline">'If you don't let me into the maxim of the
thing, how the devil &s;hall I be able to move your figures for you?'</Q></P>
<P>A letter from Flu&s;h to Standfa&s;t, after he had been &s;ix
months at Eton, &s;hall fini&s;h this chapter.&mdash;I &s;hall give it the
reader in his own words.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN WHICH THE GAME BEGINS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. STANDFAST no &s;ooner &s;at down in Lord Ha|zard's family
than, like a &s;py in an enemy's camp, he began to reconnoitre its &s;ituation,
&s;trength, and di&s;po&s;ition; to examine whether the body was well united,
whether there were any rotten members, whether centinels dared to &s;leep on
their po&s;ts, whe|ther the commanding officer was mo&s;t loved or
feared&mdash;In &s;hort, to u&s;e his own words&mdash;though I would not have
the reader infer from thence that he was a cobler in his bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;he
had the length of every foot in the family.</P>
<P>Not however to be outdone in courte&s;y, there was not one among
them that had not &s;omething to &s;ay in his favour. My Lord declared he was a
man of &s;trong intellects and &s;ound erudition. He did not think him a
&s;aint, nor wi&s;h him to be one. Solid argument, for ought he could &s;ee,
might as well be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed over a gla&s;s as a lamp, and as to gaiety and
carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, he dreaded nothing from them, for they could harbour no ill
de&s;igns. He was a little <PB N="127" REF="160"> &s;urpri&s;ed at hearing from
Standfa&s;t that he had been frequently in his life taken in, but it gave him
an opportunity of exerci&s;ing his &s;agacity by remarking that tho&s;e who mix
mo&s;t with the world, know lea&s;t of it:&mdash;as it was &s;aid of Lord
ANSON, after he had been a prey to &s;harpers, that he had been over the world,
but never in it. Upon the whole, he thought Mr. Standfa&s;t a fair,
unde&s;igning man, and both a proper tutor for his &s;on, and companion for
him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady Hazard was no le&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the
tutor. She looked upon him as an unaffected cheerful man, perfectly well bred;
and, as &s;he &s;aw his being in the hou&s;e gave her lord particular
&s;atis|faction, really felicitated her&s;elf upon this acqui&s;i|tion to the
family.</P>
<P>The butler liked him; for though he could well di&s;tingui&s;h
the different qualities of the wine, yet he never made u&s;e of his knowledge
to a poor &s;er|vant's di&s;advantage. In &s;hort, there was not a per|&s;on in
the family who&s;e good opinion he had not been anxious to procure, and one
would have thought with more care and indu&s;try than belonged to &s;uch a
trifle; for he &s;o &s;ucceeded, that he was al|lowed to be a true &s;ervant's
friend.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="161"> Mr. Standfa&s;t had certainly no Iago to
egg him on. He knew however, as well as that &s;ubtle gen|tleman him&s;elf,
that trifles light as air in ca&s;es of art are of great u&s;e, and he doubted
not but they would as much conduce to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of one kind of
hypocri&s;y as another.</P>
<P>As to the pupil, he loved Standfa&s;t like a father, and took
in&s;tructions from him full as fa&s;t as the other could give it, which,
between our&s;elves, not a little embarra&s;&s;ed the tutor, who, begging Lord
Hazard's pardon, was not &s;o profound a &s;cholar as that kind patron, in his
liberal warmth, had repre|&s;ented him.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t, feeling this deficiency, pre&s;&s;ed his
lord|&s;hip to carry his &s;cheme into execution, of having Charles taught
mu&s;ic and painting: thinking, and very rightly, that relieved by tho&s;e
avocations, he &s;hould be able to make his &s;tock of learning la&s;t as long
as he might have occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>Having worked his materials into a proper tem|per, Mr.
Standfa&s;t now began to think of moulding them to his different purpo&s;es,
but this required the nice&s;t care and circum&s;pection. My Lord plumed
him&s;elf upon being no novice, and Lady Hazard's amiable heart and
unconquerable duty <PB N="129" REF="162"> barred all po&s;&s;ibility of
flattering the mo&s;t di&s;tant hopes, had there been any &s;uch conceived, of
&s;tag|gering her virtue, or even her prudence.</P>
<P>Something Mr. Standfa&s;t was certainly hatching up, and while
it was in contemplation, a mo&s;t &s;in|gular circum&s;tance happened, which
that gentle|man did not fail to lay up as food for his project.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady Hazard were one night in a &s;ide box at the
playhou&s;e, where, behind them, &s;at a lady and two gentlemen, one of whom
the fair one often called brother, and the other Sir Daniel. At the end of the
amu&s;ement, while they were waiting for their carriage, one of the&s;e
gentlemen, &s;eeing a per|&s;on go out of the oppo&s;ite box, exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline">'there he goes, and by God I'll be after
him.'</Q> Imme|diately upon this he darted out of the box, followed by the
other, who warmly entreated him not to be precipitate. Almo&s;t at the &s;ame
moment the lady &s;hrieked out 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God there will be murder,'</Q> and
immediately fainted away.</P>
<P>Neither the good offices of Lord Hazard nor his lady were
wanting to re&s;tore her, which de&s;irable event they at length happily
achieved. The lady now begged for heaven's &s;ake he would have the goodne&s;s
to conduct her to her coach, which entreaty. <PB N="128" REF="163">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="129" REF="164">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="130" REF="165"> Lady
Hazard &s;econded with all her eloquence.&mdash;Upon this the lady's footman
from the lobby &s;um|moned the coach to the door, and my lord having very
politely &s;een her into it, returned with an in|tention to join Lady Hazard.
In his way he en|countered one of the gentlemen he had &s;een in the box, who
acco&s;ted him with 
<Q REND="inline">'I mu&s;t thank you Sir for the civility you
have done me.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' an|&s;wered Lord Hazard, with great
politene&s;s, 'if you mean in re&s;pect to any attention &s;hewn to the lady,
it was but my duty, and I am already thanked.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I dare &s;ay you are,' replied the other, 'but
that won't go down with me: In &s;hort, you are a &s;coundrel, and I in&s;i&s;t
upon deciding the matter immediately: it can be done in this
tavern.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid Lord Hazard, very &s;piritedly, 'I
do not think my&s;elf obliged to an&s;wer &s;o unprovoked and rude an
a&s;&s;ault, but as every thing in your ap|pearance, except this in&s;ult,
calls you gentleman, I attend you Sir.'</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Standfa&s;t, who had been at the other theatre,
and had, by promi&s;e, returned to go home with Lord Hazard, came up, and
boldly en|quired who it was that dared to in&s;ult that noble|man?&mdash;upon
which, a crowd having gathered about, the cry was 
<Q REND="inline">'&s;ettle it in the tavern&mdash;&s;ettle it in
the tavern.'</Q> There they now adjourned, but not be|fore 
<PB N="131" REF="166"> Lord Hazard had di&s;patched Standfa&s;t to his lady, to
reque&s;t that &s;he would &s;tay, for that he &s;hould be immediately with
her.</P>
<P>When they were come to the place of explana|tion, Lord Hazard
was more at a lo&s;s than ever.&mdash;The gentleman who had in&s;ulted him,
brought a|gain&s;t him a direct accu&s;ation of carrying on a clan|de&s;tine
corre&s;pondence with his &s;i&s;ter, which he &s;aid was doubly
di&s;honourable, as &s;he was at the point of marriage to a worthy young
baronet.</P>
<P>This charge was parried by a declaration that, till the
pre&s;ent evening, the lord had never &s;een the lady; but the brother treated
this excu&s;e with con|tempt, and was for fighting it out in&s;tantly, mixing
his invectives with &s;ome in&s;inuations about a ma&s;|querade. The company,
however, oppo&s;ed his warmth; and the clamour was &s;o various and vio|lent,
that nothing di&s;tinctly could be under&s;tood. It was therefore determined,
as with one voice, that the affair &s;hould not then be decided; but, as it
&s;eemed a matter of delicacy, the di&s;putants &s;hould privately exchange
addre&s;&s;es, and meet, with each a friend, to talk the bu&s;ine&s;s over in
the morning. This was immediately complied with, and now arrived Stand|fa&s;t,
with news that Lady Hazard had quitted the boxes, and he &s;uppo&s;ed was gone
home.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="167"> Lord Hazard and Standfa&s;t betook
them&s;elves to a hackney coach, in which, on their way, the latter was made
acquainted, as far as my lord knew it, with this my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s.
Standfa&s;t &s;aid it mu&s;t have originated in &s;ome mi&s;take, which he
&s;uppo&s;ed would be cleared up on the morrow; for, added he, 
<Q REND="inline">'you never &s;aw the lady before, did you my
lord?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Never in my life,' &s;aid Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'if you had, the
fellow need not have made &s;uch a piece of work about it, for I am very much
mi&s;taken or &s;he is one of the right &s;ort; and very likely the brother is
only a led knight, employed to bully in her cau&s;e; therefore, were I your
lord&s;hip, I would take care, if I mu&s;t be forced into a duel, it &s;hould
be with a gentle|man.'</Q></P>
<P>My Lord declared that he mo&s;t &s;incerely believed the lady
was a woman of honour; for, &s;aid he, 
<Q REND="inline">'I never &s;aw more unaffected &s;igns of
mode&s;ty. As to the brother, I think with you, that the whole matter will
prove a mi&s;take, and the affair blow over.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You know, my lord,' cried Standfa&s;t, 'I
always yield to you in matters of experience; however, we &s;hall &s;ee, for I
hope I am to have the honour of accompanying your lord&s;hip
to-morrow.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="168"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why I was thinking &s;o too,' &s;aid my lord,
'but as the gentleman may unfortunately happen to call in my ab&s;ence, and as
it would be a kind of tacit reflection on my honour if he &s;hould go away
un&s;atisfied, I will get you to &s;tay and receive him. I hope, however to
prevent his coming; for I &s;hall be out very early, to convince him that I am
as anxious to bring this bu&s;ine&s;s to a fini&s;h as him|&s;elf. As to a
&s;econd, you know, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, I can take our friend
Colonel Tiltly.'</Q></P>
<P>They now arrived at Lord Hazard's hou&s;e, where they found my
lady, who informed them that hav|ing &s;tayed till there was no &s;oul in the
theatre but her&s;elf, &s;he prevailed on the box-keeper to find her
&s;ervants, and &s;ee her to her coach: 
<Q REND="inline">'But, my lord,' &s;aid &s;he, 'what could
po&s;&s;ibly detain you?'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hazard, who had never con&s;idered that this que&s;tion
would certainly be a&s;ked him, was totally unprepared to an&s;wer it. After
&s;ome he&s;itation, however, he faultered out, in great apparent confu|&s;ion,
<Q REND="inline">'Nay not the lady, I a&s;&s;ure you my
love.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I did not know but &s;he might have had another
fit,' &s;aid Lady Hazard: 'in that ca&s;e it would have been inhumanity to have
left her.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="169"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why if it had been &s;o,' replied my lord,
'where would have been the great crime in it?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Crime!' returned her lady&s;hip, 'I had no idea
of any &s;uch thing. Charity is no crime my lord: but really your looks
accu&s;e you more than I do. I appeal to any body, if I was a jealous wife,
whe|ther a &s;tander-by would blame me if I &s;hould be &s;u&s;picious at this
moment?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well then upon my honour madam,' &s;aid Lord
Hazard, 'I only &s;aw the lady to her coach, and was returning to you, but a
particular bu&s;ine&s;s, which happened very unexpectedly, prevented me. This
Mr. Standfa&s;t knows to be truth.'</Q></P>
<P>Standfa&s;t was here beginning a very hand&s;ome excu&s;e for
his friend, when the lady &s;topt him, and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to my lord,
&s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'My dear, if you had not made this la&s;t
declaration, if your friend here had not &s;econded you, if I had actu|ally
been told that you went home with the lady, that &s;he was an old acquaintance
of yours, and that &s;he came into the box by your appointment, I &s;hould
never have mentioned the &s;ubject again;&mdash;therefore, I beg my lord I may
not hear of it from you.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="170"> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is ridiculous,' &s;aid his lord&s;hip,
'you conjure up a parcel of imaginary &s;tuff, and then argue upon it as if it
really exi&s;ted.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'God forbid it ever &s;hould exi&s;t,' &s;aid
the lady, 'I only mention it to &s;hew, if it really did, what a good wife I
&s;hould be.'</Q></P>
<P>Supper was now brought in, and the &s;ubject of cour&s;e
dropt.</P>
<P>The three per&s;ons concerned in it, however, did not &s;o
ea&s;ily di&s;mi&s;s it from their thoughts as they had from their tongues.
They neither eat much &s;upper, nor enjoyed much re&s;t; and, what appears very
extraordinary, Standfa&s;t, who one &s;hould think was lea&s;t concerned,
ruminated on it the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps the cata&s;trophe of this adventure may bring out what
his cogitations were. Tho&s;e of Lord and Lady Hazard may be very ea&s;ily
gue&s;&s;ed. I cannot help, however, remarking that this night was the fir&s;t
they ever &s;lept together without &s;peak|ing to each other, nor did my lord
ever before leave his lady &s;o early, or &s;o abruptly.</P>
<P>If the reader wi&s;hes the matter to clear up, and 
<PB N="136" REF="171"> that a reconciliation &s;hould take place, it is more
than Mr. Standfa&s;t did, who very archly remarked, as he came down &s;tairs in
the morning, that he mu&s;t be a bungling phy&s;ician indeed who did not know
how to irritate as well as to cure.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SPORT.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LADY Hazard having been told by my lord's gen|tleman that her
hu&s;band was gone out, and had left word he &s;hould not return perhaps till
dinner, &s;at down to breakfa&s;t with Mr. Standfa&s;t and her &s;on Charles,
which meal, however, was very &s;hort; for the tutor appeared exceedingly
anxious to introduce his pupil to &s;ome new author, with whom the young
gentleman &s;eemed as evidently to wi&s;h him&s;elf ac|quainted. They therefore
retired to the library, and left the lady to her&s;elf, who, for &s;ome minutes
afterwards, continued in a profound reverie, not knowing what to make of her
hu&s;band's having gone out &s;o unprecedentedly; for as to the adventure of
the preceding night, &s;he had pretty well made up her mind on it.</P>
<P>There was not much time to reflect on that or any thing el&s;e
before the door opened, and a per&s;on walked into the room, whom Lady Hazard
knew immediately for the very &s;ame Sir Daniel whom &s;he had &s;een at the
playhou&s;e. She was for a moment <PB N="138" REF="173"> a&s;toni&s;hed, but,
recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he got up, and was making her way towards the bell,
when the gen|tleman, who, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, did not &s;eem to
approve of her taking that &s;tep, got the &s;tart of her, and di&s;puted the
pa&s;s.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'No, no, my dear madam,' &s;aid he, 'that cannot

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Say Sir!' an&s;wered the lady, with a look of
in|effable di&s;dain, 'one of them was witne&s;s to your ruffian-like behaviour
la&s;t night, and would want no order from me to treat you as you

he, 'I &s;incerely regret that I have given you a moment's pain. What a wretch

&s;ervant pre&s;ently made his appearance, who a&s;king if he was wanted, was
told only to &s;ee the gentleman out; to which he an&s;wered that John 
<PB N="140" REF="175"> had opened the door, and the gentleman offered him half
a guinea, but he would not take it. 
<Q REND="inline">'Very well,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'take away the
things;'</Q> which while the &s;ervant was doing, he whi&s;pered to Lady Hazard
to compo&s;e her&s;elf:&mdash;for &s;he was on a &s;ofa, and &s;eemed indeed
extremely flurried.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervant was gone out of the room, Stand|fa&s;t
advanced to Lady Hazard, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould be extremely unhappy if, zealous in
your lady|&s;hip's cau&s;e, I have done any thing in this bu&s;ine&s;s contrary
to your wi&s;hes.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God!' cried the lady, 'how can you have
&s;uch an idea, Mr. Standfa&s;t? A ruffian a&s;&s;aulted me, and you came to my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Can &s;uch conduct demand any thing le&s;s from me than the
warme&s;t thanks.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam I beg your pardon,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t,
'but it has been a &s;trange bu&s;ine&s;s altogether. I had for one
moment&mdash;perhaps for which I ought never to be forgiven&mdash;forgot the
un&s;ullied purity of Lady Hazard; and when I heard from the gen|tleman that
in&s;inuation concerning la&s;t night&mdash;but it is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;I
&s;ee it&mdash;he mu&s;t be a villain. I will an&s;wer with my life that if
ever a heart was the man&s;ion of innocence, yours is.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="176"> 
<Q REND="inline">'I thank you for your opinion &s;ir,' &s;aid the
lady, 'I hope I de&s;erve it. As to la&s;t night, I will not make a my&s;tery
of it now, though I thought I had &s;ufficient rea&s;on for it then. After my
lord left me, this bold man came back to the box, and &s;ee|ing me alone, began
to enquire what was become of the lady? I told him that, at my de&s;ire, my
lord had conducted her to her coach; upon which he &s;aid he would remain to
thank him for his ci|vility, as well as to protect me from any
in&s;ult.&mdash;He behaved very properly at fir&s;t, but, as the hou&s;e
thinned, his conver&s;ation took quite a different turn. He fir&s;t &s;aid he
wondered my lord did not return; then &s;aid he was &s;urely gone home with the
lady; and at la&s;t a&s;&s;ured me that, to his know|ledge, &s;he was an old
acquaintance of his. At length he ventured at &s;ome rude freedoms, but at that
moment John came to a&s;k me if he &s;hould draw off the coach, and &s;eeing
what pa&s;&s;ed, did not he&s;itate to treat the ruffian pretty &s;everely for
his in&s;olence.'</Q></P>
<P>

Standfa&s;t, 'as well as for refu&s;ing the money ju&s;t now; I never thought
it of him I confe&s;s before; but I &s;ee he is a noble fellow:&mdash;but go on
madam.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;uffered my&s;elf,' &s;aid Lady Hazard, 'to
be <PB N="142" REF="177"> conducted by my &s;ervant and the box-keeper to my
coach, and came home, when having cautioned John never to open his lips on the
&s;ubject, I took the re&s;olution of keeping it from my hu&s;band's knowledge,
for fear of his re&s;entment.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Nothing could be more commendable certainly,'
&s;aid Standfa&s;t. 'In&s;ufferable impudence; in a pub|lic place too, a fellow
you had never &s;een before I &s;uppo&s;e. And then to have recour&s;e to that
&s;tale trick of accu&s;ing my lord!&mdash;&s;o worthy a charac|ter; &s;o good
a hu&s;band!'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heaven forbid I &s;hould think him
otherwi&s;e,' &s;aid the lady; 'but how came this audacious man here? Which of
the &s;ervants could &s;hew him into this apartment?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh I can account for that,' &s;aid
Standfa&s;t.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Can you &s;ir,' &s;aid the lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'That is to &s;ay,' an|&s;wered the tutor, 'I

la&s;t night, upon which, between our&s;elves, he is gone out this
morning.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, and what then?' &s;aid the lady, a little
peevi&s;hly.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What then,' cried Stand|fa&s;t, 'really it is
&s;o awkward a bu&s;ine&s;s to an&s;wer, you had better not enquire about it;
for, upon my word, I am not at liberty to tell you.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="178"> 
<Q REND="inline">'This is the &s;trange&s;t my&s;tery,' &s;aid
the lady&mdash;'Surely if you know any thing of the matter, you can explain to
me how this man came here?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why very true,' returned Standfa&s;t, 'as far
as it relates to that madam, I can have no objection. My lord, upon going out
this morning, de&s;ired me to receive every per&s;on who &s;hould call, and I
&s;uppo&s;e, as I had not left the breakfa&s;t room five minutes when this
pretty gentleman was &s;hewn up here&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But &s;till that is very extraordinary,' &s;aid
the lady, 'for no &s;ervant announced him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why then certainly he mu&s;t have been
previ|ou&s;ly &s;hewn into the library,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, while Charles and
I were in the little &s;tudy Sup|po&s;e I ring to know: but, upon &s;econd
thoughts, I had better not. One &s;ervant already has been witne&s;s
of&mdash;but, however, I will quiet him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot think of it,' &s;aid the lady, 'and
what|ever may be the con&s;equence, rather than my con|duct &s;hould appear
&s;o equivocal, I am re&s;olved to acquaint my lord with every thing, ju&s;t as
it has fallen out.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="179"> 
<Q REND="inline">'You would not &s;urely be &s;o mad,' cried
Stand|fa&s;t. 'He has quite enough upon his hands about it already: I tremble
for him at this moment.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' &s;aid the lady, 'one would think
you wanted to drive me di&s;tracted. Why tremble for him? What has he upon his
hands?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I beg your pardon madam, returned Standfa&s;t;
my anxiety, my warmth&mdash;Oh that I could di&s;|&s;emble like other men: this
ab&s;urd frankne&s;s of mine is always leading me into &s;crapes.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Standfa&s;t,' &s;aid the lady, very
earne&s;tly, 'if you have any thing to tell me that regards my
happine&s;s&mdash;for I now begin to &s;u&s;pect you have&mdash;do not keep me
in this dreadful &s;u&s;pence: if, on the contrary, my hu&s;band has
entru&s;ted you with any thing, and enjoined you not to inform me, convince him
of your friend&s;hip, by &s;hewing you are worthy of his confidence.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good heaven!' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'where is
there &s;uch another woman to be found?&mdash;of &s;uch nice
prudence!&mdash;&s;uch delicate honour! What my lord entru&s;ted me with,
madam, he certainly left to my own di&s;cretion. However, as one would think it
implied a wi&s;h to conceal every thing from you&mdash;<PB N="145" REF="180">
and yet a breach of confidence where any thing &s;o valuable as your peace of
mind is concerned would&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'By no means,' interrupted the lady; 'nothing
could induce you to forgive your&s;elf.'&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But, my dear madam,' cried Standfa&s;t, finding
her curio&s;ity &s;o tardy, 'the thing cannot remain a &s;e|cret, the
new&s;papers will be full of it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well Sir,' cried the lady, 'it will then be
time enough to tell me what I now plainly &s;ee will make me wretched whenever
I know it.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I may not live perhaps till then madam,' &s;aid
Standfa&s;t.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not live!' &s;aid Lady Hazard; 'what do you
mean?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Surely you forget my appointment,' &s;aid
Standfa&s;t, 'with the gentleman at the Smyrna.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'You will not be &s;o mad,' cried &s;he.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'How!' returned Standfa&s;t, 'my honour is
engaged, and in your cau&s;e. Adieu, and if I &s;hould fall, do me the
ju&s;tice to reflect that my la&s;t moments were &s;pent in your
&s;ervice.'</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aying, he ran precipitately down &s;tairs, re|gardle&s;s
of Lady Hazard, who &s;everal times called after him to return. She now
&s;ummoned John into her pre&s;ence, told him to go immediately to the Smyrna
coffee-hou&s;e, and de&s;ire, in her name, that Mr. Standfa&s;t would come
back, and that if he &s;aw any mi&s;chief going on, to call any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could to prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="181"> John was &s;carcely out of &s;ight when
Lady Hazard reflected what a &s;trange errand &s;he had &s;ent him on, and was
about to ring the bell to di&s;patch another &s;ervant after him, when &s;he
recollected this would be only making bad wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe what &s;he
felt. Anger for my lord&mdash;compa&s;&s;ion for Stand|fa&s;t&mdash;fear for
her&s;elf, intruded all at once on her gentle mind; and yet &s;he knew not
why.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this contention &s;he &s;ought for her &s;on,
with a view in his conver&s;ation to alleviate her unea&s;ine&s;s, when going
into the library the fir&s;t ob|ject that &s;truck her was Lord Hazard, who had
gone there in &s;earch of Standfa&s;t. Nothing could equal their mutual
&s;urpri&s;e; out of which my lord fir&s;t recovering him&s;elf, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'So madam, I am come home you &s;ee.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes,' &s;aid the lady, 'and before dinner
too.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well,' cried my lord, 'are you not obliged to
me?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'My Lord,' &s;aid Lady Ha|zard, 'I &s;hall never
think my&s;elf obliged to you for any conduct of which I don't know the
motive.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'P&s;haw!' cried my lord, 'you know I hate
di&s;|content.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And I di&s;&s;imulation,' &s;aid the
lady.'</Q></P>
<P>They were going on in this manner when Charles 
<PB N="147" REF="182"> came into the room with a book. 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh madam,' &s;aid he, 'are you here? Where is
Mr. Standfa&s;t? I came to &s;hew him the prettie&s;t thing I ever met with in
my life. Shall I read it my lord?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am in no reading mood at pre&s;ent,' &s;aid
Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Read it to me, my love,' an&s;wered the
lady.</Q></P>
<P>Charles an&s;wered, with &s;trong indications of &s;ur|pri&s;e
at the looks of his parents, 
<Q REND="inline">'I would read it to you, but it is in Greek;
however, I will tell you the &s;en&s;e of it. It is an allegorical allu&s;ion
to the polity of either a kingdom or a family, and given in the way of advice
by a &s;age to a king, who had quarrelled with his &s;ubjects.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There was a river,' &s;ays the author, 'that
de|lighted to expand its &s;mooth &s;urface to the beams of the &s;un. Its
banks were embo&s;&s;ed with ver|dure, it nouri&s;hed myriads of &s;caly
inhabitants, and it glided through the meadows with a placid and maje&s;tic
grandeur, to the &s;urpri&s;e and delight of every beholder. An unexpected
cataract, from a neighbouring mountain, on a &s;udden dimmed its lu&s;tre and
ruffled its tranquillity; till, hurried by the overbearing conflux, it forced
it&s;elf into two di&s;tinct channels:&mdash;there murmuring, it bemoaned 
<PB N="148" REF="183"> its &s;ad and vagrant fate. At la&s;t, each &s;tream, as
if by joint con&s;ent, bur&s;t the banks which &s;epa|rated them, and they met
together in affectionate reconcilement, no more to part till divided by the
ocean.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus,' &s;ays our author, 'after inte&s;tine

<P>MATTER OF THE SAME COMPLEXION.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHARLES having fini&s;hed his allegory, a&s;ked his parents how
they liked it? Lord Hazard &s;aid he believed there were very few kingdoms or
families either that were not &s;ubject to &s;uch cataracts.&mdash;Charles
an&s;wered it mu&s;t then be mi&s;management in not properly guarding again&s;t
them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You are right my dear,' &s;aid his mother, 'but
what can be done with inundations that force their way like miners in a town,
and do mi&s;chief in pro|portion as their &s;ource is concealed.'</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps my lord took this as &s;omething meant at him, for
looking very earne&s;tly at his lady, he &s;aid 
<Q REND="inline">'you are wonderfully &s;agacious madam;'</Q> and
then turning to his &s;on, a&s;ked what he had done with Mr. Standfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Here John entered the library, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'Madam, I went as your lady&s;hip ordered me,
but they were gone.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' &s;aid the lady in great apparent
con|fu&s;ion, <PB N="150" REF="185"> 'ta&mdash;'tis&mdash;very well
John&mdash;and when does her lady&s;hip&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lady&s;hip!' an&s;wered John, fir&s;t looking
at Lord Hazard, and then at his lady.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'But you &s;ay they were gone,' returned the
lady.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, tell Frill I am going to my dre&s;&s;ing
room.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, my lady,' &s;aid John, and retired.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Lord,' continued Lady Hazard, 'what could I be
thinking about?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'What indeed,' &s;aid my lord. 'Some|thing, one
would imagine, not altogether &s;o in|genuous, by your evident
embarra&s;&s;ment.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'My embarra&s;&s;ment!' an&s;wered &s;he,
recollecting her|&s;elf, and then gathering &s;trength from the
con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of her integrity, 'no my lord, there is no|thing
di&s;ingenuous in me, as you &s;hall very ea&s;ily be convinced, when you have
&s;hewn me all that pa&s;&s;es in your own heart.'</Q> So &s;aying &s;he left
the room.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In my heart,' muttered my lord. 'Why
zounds,'</Q>&mdash;but &s;eeing Charles he re&s;trained him&s;elf. Then
endeavouring to give the matter a different turn, &s;aid, with a forced
&s;mile, 
<Q REND="inline">'I &s;uppo&s;e your mother is angry at my going
out to breakfa&s;t this morn|ing. She would be prudent however not to threaten
me.'</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. Standfa&s;t came into the room, and the moment my lord
&s;aw him, he exclaimed 
<Q REND="inline">'here I am <PB N="151" REF="186"> &s;ound.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'And &s;afe I hope my lord,' &s;aid
Stand|fa&s;t.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I don't know that,' an&s;wered the patron; 'but
come with me, I have a great deal to tell you.'</Q></P>
<P>The lord and the tutor now walked out of the room, and Charles
returned to his &s;tudy; not how|ever without telling Mr. Standfa&s;t he would
not al|low him to play truant in that manner.</P>
<P>The lord told his friend, as &s;oon as they were in a room by
them&s;elves, that not finding Colonel Tiltly at home, he had been to Mr.
Snaffle's hou&s;e alone, where he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that gentle|man had
been gone out about an hour, it being then pretty early; 
<Q REND="inline">'and as I knew,' continued my lord, 'that if he
came you would give him a proper an|&s;wer, I &s;at down to wait his return. I
had &s;carcely been there five minutes before his &s;i&s;ter came in. Seeing a
&s;tranger, as &s;he imagined, &s;he would have retired, but pre&s;ently
recollecting me, &s;he paid me &s;ome well-bred acknowledgments for the
at|tention I had the plea&s;ure of paying her la&s;t night. I an&s;wered this
civility, and gave my vi&s;it a turn of enquiring after her health;
complimenting her, at the &s;ame time, on the little prejudice her fears had
done her complexion. She lamented her bro|ther <PB N="152" REF="187"> was not
at home, but added that &s;he expected him every minute, and begged I would
take break|fa&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Though I knew my hot-headed gentleman would
only be &s;till more exa&s;perated at finding me tete a tete with his
&s;i&s;ter, I re&s;olved to accept her in|vitation; nor do I repent of my
re&s;olution: for I confe&s;s to you I never met with a woman more unaffectedly
captivating. You know Standfa&s;t I like a &s;incere candid openne&s;s of
behaviour, and it was never more &s;trongly manife&s;ted than in the &s;weet
manner of this lovely young creature.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation on the
adven|ture of ye&s;terday evening, I learnt the real cau&s;e of that &s;trange
medley of circum&s;tances which in|troduced a coolne&s;s for the fir&s;t time
between my wife and me, gave me a fre&s;h proof of thy kind
attachment&mdash;here Standfa&s;t bowed&mdash;and brought me in company with
the mo&s;t lovely woman my eyes ever beheld.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find my&s;elf a great
deal more concerned in this bu&s;ine&s;s than I imagined, though poor thing
&s;he little knew it, but told me the mat|ter as if to an indifferent per&s;on;
imagining my <PB N="153" REF="188"> conduct la&s;t night demanded from her
every ex|planation.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You mu&s;t know this brother of hers is rigidly
tenacious of his &s;i&s;ter's honour, for he lies under very great obligations
to this baronet, who is &s;hortly to be married to her; and &s;he, on her
&s;ide, partakes &s;o &s;trongly of his genero&s;ity, that &s;he con&s;ents to
give her hand to a man &s;he cannot love, to pay her brother's debt of
gratitude.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She told you all this, did &s;he my lord?'
&s;aid Sandfa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh yes,' an&s;wered my lord; '&s;he has none of
that &s;ordid narrowne&s;s of mind, the re&s;ult of vul|gar &s;entiments and
mean education. She is all candour and frankne&s;s. Oh you may &s;ee in a
mo|ment &s;he has maintained a high rank in &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, you have been told that the brother very
abruptly left his &s;i&s;ter and her intended hu&s;band in the box, and
&s;allied after a gentleman whom he &s;aw coming out on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.
This man it &s;eems paid &s;ome attention to this &s;weet girl, and was
in&s;ulting enough, knowing their circum&s;tances, to propo&s;e a &s;ettlement.
This the brother re&s;ented, and a duel was the con&s;e|quence: 
<PB N="154" REF="189"> but no alarming i&s;&s;ue came of it; for after a mutual
di&s;charge of pi&s;tols, the &s;econds interfered, and, upon a promi&s;e given
by this gen|tleman, that he would never more pre&s;ume to ad|dre&s;s Mi&s;s
Snaffle, all anger &s;ub&s;ided. La&s;t week, however, at the ma&s;querade, if
you recollect, you and I paid particular attention to a lovely figure in the
dre&s;s of a circa&s;&s;ian, and to confe&s;s the truth, while you were gone to
&s;ee after our party, I made no &s;cruple to be very free with her; &s;eeing
her entirely alone, and believing her to be one of the frail &s;i&s;terhood.
She &s;ays indeed I took a number of indecent liberties; and faith the fact
might be &s;o, for we had been drinking a great deal of cham|paigne. All this
Mi&s;s Snaffle&mdash;for you have &s;een &s;he was the
circa&s;&s;ian&mdash;related to her brother, when he returned from &s;eeing
after their car|riage.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The brother immediately &s;ought after me,
directed by the de&s;cription of my dre&s;s, all over the rooms, and I dare
&s;ay we &s;hould have had a tilting bout that evening, had I not, upon joining
you, yielded to your pre&s;&s;ing entreaty to return home.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not finding me, they had nothing now for it but
conjecture who it could be that had &s;o pub|licly in&s;ulted the lady. The
&s;u&s;picion naturally <PB N="155" REF="190"> lighted on the gentleman who had
before affronted her, by his offer of a &s;ettlement. Mr. Snaffle therefore
immediately determined upon an expla|nation with him whenever they &s;hould
meet. The fir&s;t time he &s;aw him was la&s;t night at the play, where he
joined him in that &s;udden manner you have heard of, and they went together
into the Shake&s;pear. Here a very &s;ingular explanation took place: the
gentleman informed Mr. Snaffle that he had religiou&s;ly adhered to the
promi&s;e made at the conclu&s;ion of their quarrel; that how|ever he was
entirely devoted to the lady, and meant to make her honourable propo&s;als, the
moment he &s;hould, by the death of a very near relation, be relea&s;ed from
the re&s;traint which, till that event happened, would prevent his having &s;o
much hap|pine&s;s; that being neverthele&s;s unalterably at|tached to her, he
determined, as far as he decently could, to watch her inclinations, and being
that evening at the ma&s;querade, and noticing the par|ticular conduct of a
gentleman there&mdash;meaning me&mdash;had the curio&s;ity to enquire who that
gentle|man was; in which he &s;o well &s;ucceeded that I was de&s;cribed as a
reformed rake, who had mar|ried after ruining a whole village.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus you &s;ee, Mr. Snaffle being told all
the&s;e particulars, no wonder he &s;hould acco&s;t me in the 
<PB N="156" REF="191"> extraordinary manner he did, or that I &s;hould find it
nece&s;&s;ary to make the hand&s;ome&s;t apology for my conduct, which I was on
the point of doing, when I con&s;idered how awkward it would be to announce
my&s;elf. Be&s;ides, it would then have been nece&s;&s;ary to inform the lady
of the quarrel, which it was ea&s;y to &s;ee had been carefully concealed from
her. And again, I did not know whether an apology to her might &s;atisfy her
brother. Be|&s;ides, to be ingenuous, if I had made a conce&s;&s;ion, and taken
my leave, it was po&s;&s;ible I might never &s;ee her again. All the&s;e
con&s;iderations determined me &s;till to conceal my&s;elf; &s;o, after a
thou&s;and acknowledgments for her conde&s;cen&s;ion, I left a me&s;&s;age for
the brother, and ha&s;tened home to con&s;ult thee.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well my lord,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'I have
heard you to an end, and once more I caution you not to be impo&s;ed upon. In
the fir&s;t place it is a very curious thing that the lady this morning
&s;hould re|late her love, her poverty, and her gratitude, and the Lord knows
what, to a gentleman &s;he never &s;aw till la&s;t night. It puts me too much
in mind of one of the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e unfortunate poor devils who always
begin with&mdash;I was a clergyman's daughter.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="192"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith,' &s;aid my lord, &s;carcely attending to
Stand|fa&s;t, 'there was one thing e&s;caped her that charmed me. Said
&s;he&mdash;I wi&s;h I had not gone to that ma&s;|querade, or el&s;e that this
lord was not married, and a rake.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' cried Standfa&s;t, 'cannot you &s;ee
it yet? She knew you, and &s;aid this on purpo&s;e. She thought it would hit,
and &s;o it has. Such a certain &s;hot, &s;o well directed: but &s;urely, my
lord, it was too gro&s;s, too palpable, too little di&s;|gui&s;ed to pa&s;s on
you?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rather &s;ay,' returned my lord, 'too ingenuous
to contain the lea&s;t &s;hadow of art. Be&s;ides, every thing around the place
wears the air of &s;ober ele|gance. A hand&s;ome hou&s;e&mdash;'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Hired,' &s;aid the tutor, 'for the purpo&s;e of
gulling your lord&s;hip.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I cannot conceive,' &s;aid Lord Hazard, 'what
makes you &s;o warm in this bu&s;ine&s;s. You know the world I acknowledge, but
give me leave to &s;ay I know it too, Mr. Standfa&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Infinitely better,' &s;aid the par&s;on, with
an in|ward &s;neer, 'than I do, my lord, I am ready to grant: but &s;till I am
a by-&s;tander, and as you ap|pear <PB N="158" REF="193"> to be playing pretty
deep at this game, there may be no harm in giving you a caution not to be
bubbled.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know thy friend&s;hip and anxiety,' cried my
lord, 'but what is there to fear? She is a woman of honour, and if I was
inclined to think of her, there is no chance for me. Be&s;ides, I give you my
word it is not my intention ever to cau&s;e Lady Hazard a moment's
unea&s;ine&s;s:&mdash;but &s;urely a beautiful woman may be admired without any
of|fence to a wife's virtue.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'There my lord,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'is my
hope: your heart is my &s;heet anchor: and upon that I tru&s;t with comfort for
the &s;afety of your honour.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Enough,' &s;aid my lord, 'it &s;hall never
deceive thee, nor any one.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Thank you my lord,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t; 'I am
completely &s;atisfied: I will not even fear it can deceive it&s;elf. And now
pray what &s;ort of an apology do you mean to make to Mr. Snaffle?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'A full and entire one,' &s;aid my lord; 'he is
entitled to it, and &s;o is the lady. You and I will go together to-morrow
morning, and I dare &s;ay we &s;hall very ea&s;ily laugh off the whole
matter.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="194"> This being agreed on, the conver&s;ation
turned on Lady Hazard. Standfa&s;t &s;aid he conceived there was &s;ome apology
due to her. My lord did not think &s;o. He &s;aw in her conduct all the
my&s;terious inqui&s;itivene&s;s of growing jealou&s;y. It was the fir&s;t time
to be &s;ure he had ever been di&s;ingenuous with her, but circum&s;tances
required it. He now began to perceive there might be occurrences which would
admit of treating her with a &s;ort of laudable dupli|city; which indeed &s;he
ought to be thankful for:&mdash;but &s;uch was the re&s;tle&s;s and
un&s;atisfied curio&s;ity of wives, that he plainly &s;aw &s;he would
infallibly con|&s;true it into coldne&s;s and neglect. However, he had &s;een
many in&s;tances of re&s;igned acquie&s;cence in her duty, and therefore he
doubted not but this bu|&s;ine&s;s&mdash;the truth of which he was determined
to keep a &s;ecret&mdash;though it might ruffle a little, yet it would not
de&s;troy their mutual tranquillity.</P>
<P>He thought it, neverthele&s;s, incumbent on him to give the
matter &s;ome hue of probability, the bet|ter to appea&s;e her at once. To do
this he told her, as if ca&s;ually, at dinner, that an affair of honour had
called him out in the morning, but that fortunately every thing had terminated
without blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>The reflection that her hu&s;band had e&s;caped &s;uch 
<PB N="160" REF="195"> a danger, bore down in Lady Hazard's mind all other
con&s;iderations, and &s;he was in a moment per|fectly at ea&s;e. She chid him
however for preferring a fooli&s;h punctilio of honour to her peace of mind,
and his own per&s;onal &s;afety; &s;aying that his courage was too well
e&s;tabli&s;hed to need any &s;uch &s;avage and unnece&s;&s;ary proof of it:
and &s;he wondered a brutal cu&s;tom &s;hould &s;o prevail, which, far from
exhibiting any trait of true honour, or real &s;pirit, was gene|rally the
refuge of &s;harping knaves, and the la&s;t re|&s;ort of de&s;perate
cowards.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t acquie&s;ced in the ju&s;tice of the remark, and
Lord Hazard told her with a &s;mile that, had he known &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;o much &s;pirit, he would have engaged her as his &s;econd.</P>
<P>A &s;ilent minute, or rather a &s;ilent quarter of an hour, here
en&s;ued, which would perhaps have la&s;ted much longer had not the arrival of
&s;ome company put an end to their different cogitations, the &s;ubject of
which, if the reader will but think a little, by way of making one, it is not
impo&s;&s;ible but he may be able to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>As the conver&s;ation now took a mixed turn, and the general
topics of mini&s;ters, puppet-&s;hews, &s;er|mons, <PB N="161" REF="196">
plays, &s;ceptres, wa&s;h-balls, lottery tickets, loaded dice, lords, monkies,
&s;peakers, parrots, duche&s;&s;es, and drabs, were alternately handled with
&s;uch velocity and vociferation, that the parties them&s;elves were all
talkers, and no hearers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with barely men|tioning
that, while my lord was out of the room, Mr. Standfa&s;t a&s;ked Lady Hazard
when he &s;hould have the honour of communicating the re&s;ult of what &s;ent
him to the Smyrna.</P>
<P>The lady agreed to hear it the next morning, at which
Standfa&s;t &s;aid, that then, and every other moment of his life, was
perfectly at the devotion of her lady&s;hip, even though it &s;hould be
attended with far greater perils than tho&s;e he had that day
encountered:&mdash;&s;o &s;aying, he heaved a profound &s;igh, and joined the
company.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay to the reader in this place? for &s;o far
from relieving him from that &s;u&s;pen&s;e into which I have &s;o completely
thrown him, it is certainly my intention to heighten it:&mdash;but, however,
there is a remedy for &s;uch as are over impatient; for if the tenter-hooks on
which I have &s;et them prick too hard, they have nothing <PB N="162" REF="197"> to do but dip a few pages forward, and they will find them as ea&s;y
as a cu&s;hion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>WHERE THE READER BEING A LITTLE RELIEVED FROM ONE
EMBARRASSMENT WILL BE THROWN INTO ANOTHER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>No &s;ooner had the complicated din of itinerant retailers
opened the eyes, or rather the ears, of the &s;ervants&mdash;for they were yet
only half awake&mdash;in that &s;quare where Lord Hazard re&s;ided, than that
noble|man left the partner of his bed, to &s;eek after Stand|fa&s;t, who was
&s;uddenly awoke by a &s;ervant from a nap into which he had fallen about half
an hour be|fore; for the pious preceptor had been exerci&s;ing that portion of
his religious duty called watching the greater part of the night.</P>
<P>In fact, the &s;ubject which occupied his thoughts was of &s;o
complicate and nice a kind, that he had been turning it in his mind with much
care and at|tention; and after looking at it in every po&s;&s;ible
&s;ituation&mdash;rejecting this expedient, adopting that, and at la&s;t fairly
&s;atisfying him&s;elf as to the mea&s;ures to be taken&mdash;he had fallen
a&s;leep ju&s;t at the very in|&s;tant when Phoebus awoke, and walked abroad to
cheer the world, in&s;pire poets, and engender ani|malculae: 
<PB N="164" REF="199"> three employments, according to &s;ome philo&s;ophers
equally material.</P>
<P>Mr. Standfa&s;t under&s;tanding that his patron re|quired his
pre&s;ence, now only muttered tho&s;e cur&s;es which he before had been
thundering again&s;t the footman. In a few minutes he joined Lord Ha|zard, whom
he found full of impatience and anxiety.</P>
<P>My lord &s;aid he wanted to have five minutes con|ver&s;ation
with him previous to their intended bu&s;i|ne&s;s that morning; adding, that he
mu&s;t candidly confe&s;s he wi&s;hed for a pretext for continuing his vi&s;its
at Mr. Snaffle's, and that he could think of nothing but the &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'My lord,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'I am &s;orry to
&s;ee this. It can end but one way. Good God that this Sy|ren &s;hould get
&s;uch hold of you in a moment!&mdash;Why the mo&s;t inexperienced of your
adventures at Little Hockley was prudence to this.'</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;carcely &s;poken when Lady Hazard came abruptly into
the room. Addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">'My lord, I know not how you will receive the
over anxious &s;olicitude of a wife, who&s;e uniform &s;tudy has been to
admini&s;ter to your wi&s;hes; but I am impelled, by an irre&s;i&s;ta|ble 
<PB N="165" REF="200"> &s;omething, to entreat that the horrid coolne&s;s you
have &s;hewn me ever &s;ince that &s;trange bu&s;i|ne&s;s at the playhou&s;e,
may be fully explained; may be done away: that &s;o the tranquillity which
reigned in this family, till that unhappy moment, and pointed us out as fit and
worthy objects for imitation may be re&s;tored to us.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I know not what you mean,' &s;aid my
lord.&mdash;You are a charming woman; I doat on you:&mdash;therefore make
your&s;elf ea&s;y, and tru&s;t to the truth of my affection.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Heaven forbid I &s;hould doubt it,' &s;aid the
lady; 'but be a&s;&s;ured the be&s;t affections are too often en|dangered by
the &s;lighte&s;t mi&s;under&s;tandings. I believe we have all three a great
deal to confe&s;s to each other, and I came to encourage you both, by frankly
acknowledging all I know and all I con|jecture, relative to the mo&s;t
extraordinary and mo&s;t unplea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s I ever yet experienced; at
the &s;ame time, my lord, let me &s;ay I have no idle curio&s;ity to indulge,
no whim to gratify, no fooli&s;h feminine fears that alarm me, not even the
&s;lighte&s;t want of confidence in your lord&s;hip's lavi&s;h love or firm
fidelity;&mdash;I hone&s;tly and &s;a|credly believe that nothing could &s;hake
either;&mdash;but, as an artful train of flattering concurrent cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="166" REF="201"> might give them, &s;trong as they are, &s;ome &s;light
inclination to pau&s;e, I think it my duty to endeavour what I can, to
&s;u&s;tain them, to hold them &s;ecurely where they ought, and where I am
&s;ure they wi&s;h invariably to fix.'</Q></P>
<P>My lord paid his lady a very elegant, and I be|lieve a very
&s;incere compliment, on her inten|tions, attachment, affection, &s;en&s;e of
duty, and right conception of that exqui&s;ite charm in a wife's con|duct who
is never officiou&s;ly &s;olicitous, but ever on the watch to plea&s;e. He
remarked however that the breakfa&s;t would interrupt nothing.</P>
<P>Here Standfa&s;t interfering, &s;aid, that at breakfa&s;t
Charles would nece&s;&s;arily make one of the party, which he apprehended was
not Lady Hazard's wi&s;h; he therefore propo&s;ed to defer it till the evening,
or &s;ome other time, which the lady peremptorily declared &s;he could not
con&s;ent to. Indeed &s;he pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard for a hearing that very
morning, that Standfa&s;t, at the in&s;tance of my Lord Hazard, un|dertook to
&s;et his pupil a ta&s;k in the library imme|diately after breakfa&s;t, when it
was agreed that the conver&s;ation &s;hould be re&s;umed.</P>
<P>Perhaps Mr. Standfa&s;t was glad of a moment's pau&s;e. He
certainly betrayed evident &s;ymptoms of <PB N="167" REF="202">
a&s;toni&s;hment at the fir&s;t part of Lady Hazard's harrangue, which, added
to an affected indif|ference, and a forced &s;prightline&s;s, would have
con|veyed to an uninterrupted by-&s;tander, a trait or two of &s;u&s;picion
that the lady's conduct was not altoge|ther agreeable to him: but we have
already hinted that he never &s;uffered long under perturbation of any kind.
Thus, whatever inward &s;en&s;ations might produce the above effects, they
certainly did not re|main vi&s;ible long enough to be noticed either by the
lord or the lady; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;um|moning his pupil to
breakfa&s;t, he had &s;o rallied his &s;pirits, that he appeared the mo&s;t
cheerful and un|concerned of the whole company.</P>
<P>It was far otherwi&s;e with my lord. He &s;et it down for a
certainty that his lady had, by &s;ome means, di&s;covered all that had pa&s;t,
and divined all that was likely to come. Neverthele&s;s, he felt no reluctance
to review his intentions either in one light or the other; but certain
namele&s;s &s;en&s;ations, which he felt in &s;pight of him&s;elf gave his
behaviour an awkwardne&s;s which was apparent in proportion as he endeavoured
to hide it.</P>
<P>Charles was no &s;ooner informed by his father that he had
&s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Standfa&s;t, and given his ta&s;k, than
he retired to the library, <PB N="168" REF="203"> when the lady, after an
apology much in the &s;tyle of the former one, acquainted her hu&s;band with
all &s;he knew relative to this &s;trange affair: not even omitting either the
in&s;ult &s;he had received the morn|ing before, the &s;pirited kindne&s;s of
Standfa&s;t, or the me&s;&s;age &s;he had &s;ent after him to the Smyrna; which
la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s clearly accounted for her con&s;u|&s;ion in the library
when John came back; whom &s;he al&s;o loaded with prai&s;es, in which
Standfa&s;t joined, declaring, at the &s;ame time, that the hiring of that
worthy fellow was a new in&s;tance that Lord Hazard's knowledge of the world
and judgment of mankind was &s;uperior to his, for that John had what he
thought a forbidding countenance, which his lord&s;hip, however, with a
penetration far be|yond his, had con&s;trued into a &s;ign of bluntne&s;s and
plain dealing. 
<Q REND="inline">'But madam,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, 'I interrupt
you.'</Q></P>
<P>The lady went on, &s;aying that her hu&s;band's new and
extraordinary conduct had fir&s;t given her the alarm. In addition to this, a
&s;ervant had been privy to the treatment &s;he had received from the baronet
at the theatre. Again, he who ought to have pro|tected her was out of the way,
when Mr. Standfa&s;t &s;tept forward in her defence. In &s;hort, &s;uch
con|cealments and &s;uch obligations were very repug|nant to her delicacy,
which &s;he hoped his lord&s;hip, <PB N="169" REF="204"> in this ca&s;e, would
conceive was not affected or over|&s;trained. My lord, &s;he added, was the
proper per|&s;on to reward the &s;ervant and thank Mr. Standfa&s;t, who, though
a gentleman in years, and perfectly exemplary in his manners, was by no means a
pro|per confident for her who thought it her fir&s;t hap|pine&s;s to have no
wi&s;h or thought concealed from her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome very high compliments on the
frankne&s;s, kindne&s;s, and great propriety of his lady's declaration and
conduct. He owned he thought the bu&s;ine&s;s of the baronet perfectly
inex|plicable; but the&s;e and all other con&s;iderations were &s;wallowed up
in the obligations he thought him&s;elf under to Standfa&s;t, who took all
the&s;e com|pliments with the &s;ame compo&s;ure as he would have received his
&s;alary, or any thing el&s;e which he con|ceived to be perfectly his own
property.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip de&s;ired this worthy friend, as he called him,
to relate the i&s;&s;ue of his meeting the baronet at the Smyrna; but
Standfa&s;t remarked that the harve&s;t of dome&s;tic tranquillity this
di&s;covery promi&s;ed, belonged entirely to his lord&s;hip and the amiable
Lady Hazard; that at be&s;t he was but a privileged gleaner, who &s;aw, but
envied not, that abundant happine&s;s which kindly let fall as much 
<PB N="170" REF="205"> comfort as he de&s;ired, and more, infinitely more than
he de&s;erved:&mdash;he therefore begged to come in his place. 
<Q REND="inline">'Be&s;ides,' added he, 'totally ignorant as your
lord&s;hip is of the motives of the&s;e people for &s;tirring up all this
mi&s;chief, your &s;tory cannot but involve &s;ome awkwardne&s;s which my after
ex|planation may relieve; for I fancy the baronet has made me more <HI>au
fait</HI> to this bu&s;ine&s;s than either of you.'</Q></P>
<P>His lord&s;hip, taking this as a friendly hint of the tutor, to
clear up any embarra&s;&s;ment that might ari&s;e in his narrative, con&s;ented
to unfold. It is but truth to &s;ay that his relation was not &s;o ingenu|ous
as that of his lady had been; for he did not mention the cau&s;e of the
quarrel, nor that it yet exi&s;ted; but, on the contrary, &s;aid that the whole
was a mi&s;take, the brother having taken him for another per&s;on, who had, it
&s;eems, offered an in&s;ult to the &s;i&s;ter, and that every thing was
amicably made up. He &s;unk entirely the circum&s;tance of his having &s;een
Mi&s;s Snaffle the day before; he al&s;o forbore to touch on his intention of
paying that lady a &s;econd vi&s;it; and indeed on any one point that could
give the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on for conjecture that the whole was any other than
a matter of a common cur&s;ory kind, which, in proportion as it was
my&s;|terious, &s;o it &s;unk to nothing, the my&s;tery being 
<PB N="171" REF="206"> cleared away. He was very much alive however to all
tho&s;e matters relative to Sir Daniel Dogbolt.&mdash;He hoped his friend would
be able to clear them up: for, after all, he &s;hould not con&s;ider that part
of the bu&s;ine&s;s at an end without a full and explicit &s;a|tisfaction for
the in&s;ult his wife had &s;u&s;tained in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'I am heartily &s;orry you were ab&s;ent,'
&s;aid Stand|fa&s;t. 'Proud as I was of cha&s;ti&s;ing his in&s;olence, it was
certainly your right.'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Hazard acknowledged his obligations, and proceeded to
fini&s;h his account of this bu&s;ine&s;s, in which, upon the whole, he &s;o
well &s;ucceeded, that Lady Hazard declared &s;he was, except a little
re|maining curio&s;ity, perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Now came the tutor's turn. He began with &s;ay|ing he had a much
longer tale to tell than either of them, and that &s;ince he was not then bound
by the painful duty which had hitherto punctiliou&s;ly kept him from divulging
it, he thought him&s;elf obliged openly and without re&s;erve to declare all he
knew on the &s;ubject. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' added he, 'I believe my lord they are too
artful a &s;et for us to place any reliance on what they tell us. What I am
going now to inform you, I forced from the pretty ba|ronet&mdash;if 
<PB N="172" REF="207"> he be one&mdash;who had the unparalleled in&s;olence to
in&s;ult this lady, for which&mdash;and I hope your lord&s;hip will not blame
my too forward zeal, I had the honour of calling him to account.</Q></P>
<P>Standfa&s;t here received the compliments he had once more
fi&s;hed for, and then went on: not with|out fir&s;t exclaiming 
<Q REND="inline">'Heavens! why my lord a per|fect &s;tranger
would have been entitled to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance I gave, much le&s;s her
lady&s;hip. A meer common exerci&s;e of humanity. Be&s;ides, the gen|tleman
gave me very little trouble. He fences pretty well, but I &s;oon di&s;armed
him; and having his life in my power, I made u&s;e of this oppor|tunity of
extorting from him an account of him|&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates. He &s;aid
he had long &s;e|cretly admired Lady Hazard, that he had tried many experiments
to get an opportunity of di&s;|clo&s;ing his pa&s;&s;ion, but found none which
had the &s;malle&s;t appearance of fea&s;ibility till about three weeks ago, at
the ma&s;querade, where you may remember we were in a very large
party.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Good God,' cried Lady Hazard, 'I recollect it.
A man certainly did teaze me at the ma&s;que|rade, but I took it for &s;ome
drunken fool, and never gave the matter a &s;econd thought.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="208"> 
<Q REND="inline">'He told me,' &s;aid Standfa&s;t, he fir&s;t
acco&s;ted your lord&s;hip, drew you away from your com|pany, and introduced
you to another, that he might have better opportunity to entertain her
lady&s;hip. His words were that he had found an impregnable fortre&s;s, and
therefore, from that moment, de|termined to give up the attack; but accident
in|troducing him into the &s;ame box at the playhou&s;e, his wi&s;hes revived,
and re&s;olving to make u&s;e of the occa&s;ion that pre&s;ented it&s;elf
through Mr. Snaffle's quarrel with the gentleman in the oppo|&s;ite box, he
dropt him in the crowd, and returned to Lady Hazard ju&s;t as your lord&s;hip
had gone to conduct Mi&s;s Snaffle to her coach. He confe&s;&s;ed that, to
ingratiate him&s;elf, he had told her lady|&s;hip &s;everal fal&s;ities, &s;uch
as that you my lord had an intimacy with Mi&s;s Snaffle, that you were then
gone home with her, all which we have already heard. In &s;hort, fir&s;t making
him an&s;wer many other que&s;tions, I gave him his life, and &s;uffered him to
leave me, after he had prote&s;ted in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner that he would
never dare to mention the name of this lady in future upon any account
whatever.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, my lord, the&s;e are the facts: now hear
my comments on them. This man is not a baro|net, <PB N="174" REF="209"> neither
is he upon the point of marrying this young lady, nor are they any other than
three &s;harpers, who have in &s;ome way or other a dark plot on the conjugal
peace of your worthy lady and your&s;elf. This Sir Daniel did draw you a&s;ide
from your company, and introduced you to this very Mi&s;s Snaffle: with what
de&s;ign is another matter: but it is very extraordinary you &s;hould be left
by this baronet with his intended wife, that he might the better introduce
him&s;elf to Lady Hazard.&mdash;Nor am I mi&s;taken as to the lady, for I heard
a chair called in her name.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'You cannot forget my lord that we at that time
decided that &s;he was a woman of no character. I remember your &s;aying with
great earne&s;tne&s;s, Stand|fa&s;t, let us not pay Lady Hazard &s;o ill a
compli|ment as to &s;peak to a creature of this &s;tamp;&mdash;though &s;he is
under the &s;ame roof with her.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, my lord, can it be, after what I have
&s;aid, that this is a woman of honour? that her brother is a man of the
nice&s;t feelings? and that Sir Daniel Dogbolt is on the point of marriage with
this woman? No, my lord, it is, as I &s;aid, a plot again&s;t you; however,
thank heaven, armed with a proper confidence in each other, you may de&s;pi&s;e
it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="210"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Standfa&s;t has placed this matter in its
true light,' &s;aid the lady. 'For my part, I am per|fectly at ea&s;e, and I am
&s;ure my lord will thank me for waving all ab&s;urd delicacy, and coming to
this declaration.'</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;everal &s;uitable remarks were made, Mr. Standfa&s;t was
loaded with thanks, and the mo&s;t per|fect harmony was re&s;tored. After this
the lady re|tired to her dre&s;&s;ing room, and left the two friends
together.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner alone than Lord Hazard be|gan anew to
compliment and thank Mr. Standfa&s;t. That gentleman a&s;&s;ured his patron his
thanks were more than he de&s;erved; and indeed he &s;poke truth. However, no
one upon earth could have bel eved his conduct to be any other than cordial
zeal and &s;in|cere friend&s;hip; conformable to which appearances, he &s;aid
he would not leave his lord&s;hip till he had made him a firm promi&s;e not to
&s;ee that woman any more, who he mu&s;t now very plainly perceive was a
&s;uborned wretch, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;ome vile plot again&s;t his dome&s;tic
peace.</P>
<P>My lord did not he&s;itate to make this promi&s;e; for he was
charmed with the angel-like conduct of <PB N="176" REF="211"> his lady, and
went &s;o far as to &s;ay that, &s;eeing the matter now in the &s;ame light
with the tutor, he felt him&s;elf at ea&s;e with relation to Sir Daniel
Dogbolt, as well as the re&s;t. Standfa&s;t hearing this, and being told that
his kindne&s;s &s;hould not go unremembered, went, with the greate&s;t air of
&s;atisfaction to &s;eek his pupil.</P>
<P>As the &s;ingle articles in my account with the rea|der begin
again to be pretty numerous, I &s;hall now, for his &s;atisfaction, add them
up, and carry them over. To &s;peak without metaphor, Mr. Standfa&s;t plea&s;e
to unma&s;k.</P>
<P>The preceptor then had, in conjunction with Vi|ney, concerted
this whole &s;cheme. The ma&s;que|rade, the playhou&s;e, the interview, and
every other part of it, was as regularly dige&s;ted as the trial of a felon
before he comes to the bar at the Old Bailey. Mr. Viney had tutored the
gentleman, and Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y had in&s;tructed the lady.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t, however, who had contrived the whole plot, was
totally unknown to any of the actors in it. His argument with Viney and Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y was, that as they enjoyed the utmo&s;t they ever could expect
from Lord Hazard, they had no mea&s;ures <PB N="177" REF="212"> to keep with
him; e&s;pecially as ever &s;o violent a rupture could not deprive either him
of his living, or her of her annuity. On the contrary, that he, Standfa&s;t,
might in a moment lo&s;e both his &s;alary and his expectations, which were not
trifles. He therefore &s;tipulated not to be &s;een at all, but in their privy
council; and in&s;tructions were particularly given to the under villains to be
more cautious in deceiving him than any other of the family.</P>
<P>This ma&s;ter &s;troke could be worthy of no other than
Standfa&s;t. To teach his tools to look upon him as their enemy, &s;ecured him
from all po&s;&s;ibility of detection; for he knew he might laugh at the
re|&s;entment of Viney, even if he had any cau&s;e to &s;u&s;|pect him of
treachery: his own <HI>ipfe dixit</HI> being al|ways &s;ufficient to overturn
any thing of that kind with his patron. Nay, notwith&s;tanding this
infor|mation, the reader is almo&s;t obliged to confe&s;s that he is innocent;
for his conduct gives the lie direct even to what I have advanced of him. It is
very true that we have &s;een him act the part of a di&s;inte|re&s;ted friend,
we have heard him coun&s;el Lord Ha|zard to &s;hun that very plot he him&s;elf
had laid for him, and one would think he had &s;o far &s;ucceeded again&s;t
him&s;elf&mdash;if I may be allowed the expre&s;|&s;ion&mdash;that the&s;e
&s;windlers in love &s;eem to be turned out of employ: the gentlemen to hunt
other game <PB N="178" REF="213"> at the hazard table, or perhaps on the
highway, and the lady to ruin apprentices, or gull libidinous elders.</P>
<P>If the reader thinks thus of Mr. Standfa&s;t, he is not yet half
acquainted with that con&s;ummate fabri|cator of dome&s;tic ruin. A &s;imple
intrigue, and the common incidental train of di&s;quietude attending it, would
not have been a luxury inexorable enough for him. In &s;hort, Mr. Standfa&s;t,
put on your ma&s;k again; for we will not &s;ee your naked heart till we are
prepared to pronounce, by a knowledge of the &s;pecies of de&s;truction it
meditates&mdash;that in the round of human conception there is not &s;o
&s;hocking a piece of deformity as a complete hypocrite.</P>

<PB REF="214">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>SEVERAL LETTERS, MORE PLOT AND INTRIGUE, AND SOME OF IT FROM A
VERY UNEXPECTED QUARTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE day on which this eclairci&s;&s;ement took place was
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the cheerfulne&s;s that &s;at on every countenance. Indeed
&s;o remarkable was the prevalent good humour, that Mr. Standfa&s;t was
heartily joined by a great deal of company, who dined at my lord's, when he
ventured an opinion that Hazard hou&s;e had the only roof in town that could
boa&s;t of a couple perfectly elegant and per|fectly happy. I do not pretend to
a&s;&s;ert that this declaration was truth; I only &s;ay the company then
pre&s;ent allowed it to be &s;o.</P>
<P>My lord would not read a &s;ingle letter&mdash;for many were
that day brought him&mdash;le&s;t it &s;hould give a tinge of
di&s;&s;atisfaction that might check the general hilarity. They were all
ordered to be laid in the &s;tudy, and it was agreed that he and Standfa&s;t
&s;hould look them over the next morning.</P>
<P>The whole day being like a &s;mooth &s;ea, which looked the more
beautiful for having been a little <PB N="180" REF="215"> ruffled, we will
glide over it, as too uniform for any &s;triking remarks, and come to the next,
which was a little more agitated.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, his lord&s;hip and
Standfa&s;t, according to agreement, retired to ex|amine the letters. The&s;e
were &s;even in number, and as four of them in &s;ome degree relate to this
hi&s;tory, I &s;hall in&s;ert them, together with the remarks of their
examiners. Indeed it was once in my head to have given this whole hi&s;tory
through that ve|hicle, but I con&s;idered that making my per&s;onages retire to
their clo&s;ets before they di&s;clo&s;ed their &s;en|timents would have thrown
a frigidity over the bu|&s;ine&s;s; be&s;ides the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of
relating every thing two or three times over, and always partially. Be&s;ides I
may introduce &s;ome characters who cannot write, and others who will not. Mr.
Standfa&s;t, for in&s;tance, would not have been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of half the
cunning I have given him if any thing could have induced him to di&s;clo&s;e
his &s;enti|ments upon paper.</P>
<P>Upon reflection, therefore, I was determined not to follow a
method, however fa&s;hionable, by which I mu&s;t have made villains confide
their vices, and young ladies their wi&s;hes&mdash;which, if they felt
deli|cately, they would find difficult to expre&s;s at all, 
<PB N="181" REF="216"> much le&s;s in a letter&mdash;to their confidants and
clerks of the roads.</P>
<P>All &s;uch matters con&s;idered, I have left the&s;e
penny-po&s;t men in biography to them&s;elves, con|tented to jog on an old
road, where what the pro&s;|pects want of trimming and regulation, will, I
tru&s;t, be made up in &s;imple and natural luxuriance. But to the letters
under examination. 
<LETTER>

<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> The letter I now &s;end you is accompanied by one from your

part of the e&s;tate in Warwick&s;hire which includes the man&s;ion, and the
farm contiguous to it; in which ca&s;e neither Zekiel nor I &s;hall be further
trouble&s;ome to you: but contentedly make his two hundred a year and my three

<P>Standfa&s;t having thanked the lady for her glance at him, and
my lord having laughed heartily at the good natured reflection on his
extraction, in the latter part of the letter, they pa&s;&s;ed on to the next,
which contained what follows. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD AND FATHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> For &s;o I believe you are; at lea&s;t you could 
<PB N="183" REF="218"> not prove to the contrary, and that's enough for me to
know I &s;hall inherit in &s;pight of my bro|ther Charles. But, however, as I
don't want to be undutiful, I &s;hall only tell you this: I am &s;ick of Eton;
I'd rather follow a pack of hounds; and &s;o d'ye &s;ee I have de&s;ired mother
to make you a propo&s;ial concerning Warwick&s;hire. If &s;o be you like to
agree to it, its very well: if not, I am de|termined to look out for a

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'What could a guardian do?' &s;aid my
lord.&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Faith be very trouble&s;ome,' replied
Standfa&s;t. 'The&s;e e&s;tates in tail, without right of wa&s;te, are, of all
legal niceties, the be&s;t mor&s;el for a litigious &s;tomach. As to what the

con|tending for; but I think I would not be bullied out of any thing.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, we will con&s;ider what is to be done,'
&s;aid his lord&s;hip; 'in the mean time let us to the next.'</Q> 
<PB N="184" REF="219"> So &s;aying, he opened another letter, which came by the
po&s;t, and was written by Sir Sidney Roebuck. The&s;e were the contents. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I take the liberty to write to you concerning your village
of Little Hockley, which, &s;ince the ab&s;ence of your lord&s;hip, and the
death of Major Malplaquet, has ri&s;en to &s;uch maturity in &s;ingular and
enormous vice as I &s;incerely hope cannot be paralleled.</P>
<P> I have been obliged to be at the pains of ex|erting
my&s;elf very &s;trenuou&s;ly in my capacity of magi&s;trate, but &s;mugglers,
marauders, and other lawle&s;s characters, for whom this vile place is be|come
a remarkable a&s;ylum, are difficult to deal with. My fir&s;t idea was, in
conjunction with the members for the county, to beg the interference of
parliament; but, conceiving that much delicacy was due to your lord&s;hip in
this bu&s;ine&s;s, I beg previou&s;ly to con&s;ult you.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="220"> If you will treat for the village,
or, &s;hould that be incompatible with the conditions of your in|heritance, if
you will lea&s;e it to me, perhaps I may be able to bring about a
reformation.</P>
<P> I have no doubt but your lord&s;hip will rejoice in
forwarding a work &s;o dear to the intere&s;t of hu|manity, and &s;hould be
happy to receive your im|mediate an&s;wer, as I wi&s;h to make &s;ome
arrange|ments at Ca&s;tlewick, agreeable to the re&s;ult of this application,
before I attend my duty at the hou&s;e, when I &s;hall have the honour to call
on your lord&s;hip, with a view to a further conference on this &s;ubject.</P>

obedient Servant, S. W. ROEBUCK.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Lord Hazard, as I formerly mentioned, received his rents
regularly from his &s;teward, and therefore did not dream of the enormities
carried on at Little Hockley. He now fir&s;t reflected that the&s;e &s;eeds of
vice he had him&s;elf &s;own; and as wickedne&s;s, like weeds, flouri&s;hes
be&s;t where there are no whole|&s;ome plants to interrupt its growth, he
ea&s;ily per|ceived <PB N="186" REF="221"> and felt the truth of Sir Sidney's
relation; and, therefore, determined to acquaint him that he was as well
di&s;po&s;ed as him&s;elf to perfect &s;o de&s;ira|ble an undertaking, and that
he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After examining another letter or two, they came to the
following one. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD HAZARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> As you have thought proper to take no notice of what
pa&s;&s;ed the other evening, when I had the honour of calling your lord&s;hip
&s;coundrel, I &s;up|po&s;e you acquie&s;ce in the ju&s;tice of the
term:&mdash;I &s;hall therefore, in future, &s;peak of you as of a wretch
de&s;erving pity, and though a lord, beneath the notice of a gentleman.</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>I am, &amp;c. PETER SNAFFLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' &s;aid my lord, 'this is too &s;hocking to
pa&s;s. I mu&s;t break the fellow's bones.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="222"> 
<Q REND="inline">'Rather get a chairman to do it,' &s;aid
Standfa&s;t. Did not you wait at the ra&s;cal's hou&s;e two hours? Where was he
all that time? No, no, they think you begin to &s;mell the matter out, and &s;o
are grown de&s;perate. Does not all this confirm my &s;u&s;picions?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'But &s;till,' &s;aid my lord, 'there is
&s;omething cur&s;edly unplea&s;ant in letting &s;uch a &s;coundrel go on with
impunity. I am determined,' conti|nued he, 'to give him manuel cha&s;ti&s;ement
where|ever I meet him.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not at all,' cried Standfa&s;t, 'till he has
e&s;ta|bli&s;hed his credentials to di&s;pute a point of honour with your
lord&s;hip.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Well, well, perhaps you are right,' &s;aid my
lord, 'you generally &s;ee things very properly. Let us talk no more of the
damned fellow; he has &s;et my blood in a ferment.'</Q></P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was interrupted by a note from Ingot, in the
city, with whom&mdash;as the reader for|merly heard from Mr.
Standfa&s;t&mdash;Lord Hazard &s;ometimes banked. The letter was concerning the
transfer of &s;ome &s;tock, and other bu&s;ine&s;s, on which he required to
&s;ee his lord&s;hip at an early opportu|nity; and my lord, as he was anxious
to advi&s;e with <PB N="188" REF="223"> coun&s;el what was be&s;t to be done
with Mrs. O'Shock|ne&s;y and her &s;on, thought he could not take a pro|perer
time than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>As his lord&s;hip went alone into the city, he had lei&s;ure to
revolve in his mind the various bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, and in particular the
&s;ubject of the letter from Snaffle, which he did not enter into much be|fore
Mr. Standfa&s;t: knowing that an inclination to indulge his feelings would meet
with every po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;ition from that careful friend.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, however, that he gave Stand|fa&s;t credit
for the goodne&s;s of his intentions, he could not help thinking the
conjectures of that gen|tleman rather pre&s;cient than wi&s;e, careful than
certain. What was all this mighty bu&s;ine&s;s? Why truly a hot-headed fellow
had in&s;ulted him with great acrimony, and written to him with great
im|pertinence. What were Standfa&s;t's ideas of this matter? That a plot was
laid to di&s;turb his dome&s;tic repo&s;e. In truth it appeared &s;o by the
a&s;&s;ault on his lady, and looked &s;omething like it by the tempting
opportunity that had been given him of addre&s;&s;ing a very beautiful woman.
Well, it was &s;o perhaps: in that ca&s;e the proper check had been given to
the fir&s;t; and, as to the latter, he could &s;ee no ruinous 
<PB N="189" REF="224"> con&s;equences that would en&s;ue, even were they to
carry their &s;cheme into execution. He could not be drawn into a marriage, and
therefore an intrigue was the wor&s;t that could be apprehended. This it was
his bu&s;ine&s;s to avoid; and he certainly &s;hould do &s;o: but was this any
rea&s;on why he mu&s;t put up with a mo&s;t provoking and impudent affront? No,
no; he mu&s;t beg leave to under&s;tand the etiquette of his own honour as well
as Mr. Standfa&s;t. He was no &s;chool boy, and therefore took the liberty to
di&s;|&s;ent from the nece&s;&s;ity of having his actions eternally
in&s;pected; and as to the affront, which he neither could nor would brook, a
proper time &s;hould cer|tainly be taken to re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard had now arrived to that very pitch where Standfa&s;t
wi&s;hed to conduct him. The tutor knew that no longer to confide in him was
the only way to keep him &s;afe from all con&s;equences. He waited with
malicious joy for the moment when the patron would voluntarily exclaim, Oh that
I had taken thy advice! Oh that thy &s;alutary coun&s;el had been
followed!&mdash;and I &s;ay to the reader, woe be to Lord Hazard if ever the
moment &s;hould arrive when &s;uch an exclamation &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary. But
at pre|&s;ent let us change the &s;cene.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his lord&s;hip's bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. 
<PB N="190" REF="225"> Ingot, a lady pa&s;&s;ed through the room, whom he
remarked &s;poke nothing but French; for there were two gentlemen with her, one
of whom told Mr. Ingot, in very broken Engli&s;h, that the lady wi&s;hed him a
good morning.</P>
<P>After they were gone, Ingot told my lord that there was
&s;omething &s;ingular in the lady's &s;tory, which had been &s;o interwoven
with a bu&s;ine&s;s con|cerning money he had been recommended to tran&s;|act
for her, that he could not but be perfectly ac|quainted with it.</P>
<P>My lord, who had never any improper curio&s;ity, &s;eemed very
indifferent about hearing it; &s;aying there were family matters in it not
proper to be divulged.</P>
<P>Ingot a&s;&s;ured my lord that was not the ca&s;e at all; on the
contrary, he &s;hould tell it to every one he knew; becau&s;e it placed in a
more glaring point of view the &s;candalous traffic and &s;hameful &s;elling
and buying of con&s;ciences among the papi&s;ts (a &s;ect it &s;eems for which
Mr. Ingot had a great inveteracy) than any in&s;tance that had ever come within
his knowledge.</P>
<P>My Lord &s;miled, and Mr. Ingot continued.&mdash; 
<PB N="191" REF="226"> 
<Q REND="inline">'This lady, when &s;he was very young, having
un|fortunately an intrigue with a &s;tranger her father had a great aver&s;ion
to, &s;he was &s;ecluded in a con|vent, but what convent her lover never could
learn. After &s;ome time, being per&s;uaded by her friends that her enamorato
had played her fal&s;e, &s;he was prevailed on to take the veil, and &s;hut
her&s;elf up, as every one thought, for ever.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'About a year and a half ago her father died in
England, having long repented of his daughter's ill treatment, and made a will,
leaving her his whole fortune, all ve&s;ted in the Engli&s;h funds. Mind the
conditions: to be &s;pent in France, half for her own u&s;e, and half in pious
donations&mdash;provided a di&s;|pen&s;ation of her vow could be obtained: but,
in default of this, to go to Engli&s;h charities.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Here was manife&s;t the cunning of the
Frenchman. He thought, and rightly too, the pious donations in France would
procure intere&s;t enough to obtain the di&s;pen&s;ation of her vow. Ay, ay,
the Pope &s;hall make a bargain with any Jew in Duke's-place.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'The di&s;pen&s;ation was obtained, with this
&s;ingle provi&s;o&mdash;which indeed gra&s;ped at the whole

liberty to go out when &s;he plea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="227"> 
<Q REND="inline">'The&s;e terms the lady accepted, and giving
&s;ecu|rity for her return, &s;he was permitted to come to England, in company

&s;he has now done, and, in a week or ten days will return to France.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'An extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s indeed,' &s;aid
Lord Hazard.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Yes, yes,' replied Ingot, with great
arch|ne&s;s; 'the church of Rome never fails to &s;tretch its prerogative when
intere&s;t is in the ca&s;e. How happy are we who live under the three
e&s;tates and the prote&s;tant religion?'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Spoken as a citizen &s;hould &s;peak,' &s;aid
my lord. 'Poor lady, I dare &s;ay &s;he rejoices at her e&s;cape from

<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Oh &s;he knows nobody here,' cried Ingot.
'Ex|cept one gentleman, &s;he has not enquired for a &s;ingle creature. How
&s;he came to know him is a my&s;tery to me. It is Sir Sidney Roebuck. I have
promi&s;ed to find him out for her if he be in town.'</Q>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE LAST SUBJECT FOLLOWED UP&mdash;A LETTER FROM EMMA, AND
OTHER IMPORTANT MATTER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT very afternoon Lord Hazard wrote an an|&s;wer to Sir
Sidney's letter, the receipt of which gave the baronet &s;uch &s;atisfaction,
that it ha&s;tened his journey to town, where in a few days he arrived; for his
concerns were always in &s;o regular a &s;tate, that he could at any time leave
them with very &s;hort preparation: and Lady Roebuck, who was of all women
living the propere&s;t wife for &s;uch a man, never required much warning to
follow him through all his duties; for &s;uch he conceived every one of his
pur&s;uits. It was a duty to di&s;charge all tru&s;ts, to an&s;wer all letters,
to return all vi&s;its: but then he took care to undertake nothing but what he
could conveniently do, to receive no vi&s;its but from tho&s;e he liked, and to
reject all unnece&s;&s;ary or imperti|nent corre&s;pondents. It was al&s;o with
him a duty to be merry, and to make others &s;o; and he could with equal
ea&s;e&mdash;ay, and without any deviation from his illu&s;trious extraction,
which I have already &s;aid he was pretty proud of&mdash;walk a minuet with a 
<PB N="195" REF="230"> duche&s;s, on a birth-night, or crack a facetious je&s;t
with a cobler. He might be termed an elegant oddity; and to his peculiarities,
for they were all amiable, did his lady accommodate her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Before they &s;et out it was agreed to leave the faith|ful Emma
with little Annette, who had nearly reached her fourteenth year, and was grown
a mo&s;t beautiful young creature. Lady Roebuck loved her with an intere&s;ting
and lively tenderne&s;s. She had watched her growing perfections with at
lea&s;t ma|ternal care; for had &s;he been twenty times her own daughter, &s;he
could not have paid more attention to her education, or felt more plea&s;ure at
tho&s;e dawning accompli&s;hments with which &s;he promi&s;ed to be remarkably
gifted.</P>
<P>Emma &s;aid &s;he had peru&s;ed her little mind with profound
attention, and though &s;he was no further than the introduction, it was
prefaced with a pro|mi&s;e of &s;uch delightful matter as could not fail to
charm the hearts of all readers. She could di&s;cern that the &s;ubject was
intere&s;ting, the moral in&s;truc|tive, and that goodne&s;s and virtue were
&s;trongly in|culcated in every page.</P>
<P>Annette and Emma then, and the whole village of Ca&s;tlewick
were left under the care of the good <PB N="196" REF="231"> Mildman, who had
not &s;uffered at all in the opinion of Sir Sidney, for having been turned into
a &s;care|crow for the amu&s;ement of the Hockleyites.</P>
<P>Sir Sidney and his lady arrived in town, at the period above
mentioned; and a card was almo&s;t in|&s;tantly di&s;patched to Lord Hazard,
purporting that the baronet intended to pay him a vi&s;it in a day or two, to
talk over the bu&s;ine&s;s of Little Hockley.</P>
<P>The peer and the baronet &s;oon came to an eligible agreement;
and as lea&s;es and title deeds were obliged to be con&s;ulted in great plenty,
during the cour&s;e of this negociation, a &s;ort of cordiality grew between
the le&s;&s;or and le&s;&s;ee. Sir Sidney acknowledged there was great
fairne&s;s and candour in the conduct of the peer, and facetiou&s;ly remarked
he was glad to &s;ee &s;o good an under&s;tanding between the upper and lower
hou&s;e. As to my lord, he looked up to Sir Sidney as a being of a &s;uperior
kind, and while he penetrated his amiable and benignant views, his only wonder
was that every man of ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions did not do the &s;ame, &s;ince
his reward was &s;o certain and &s;o immen&s;e.</P>
<P>The ladies, who I have more than once remarked were to their
hu&s;bands what an echo is to the voice, had al&s;o commenced &s;omething more
than an ac|quaintance; <PB N="197" REF="232"> which both the hu&s;bands
&s;trongly re|commended. Indeed this intimacy had well nigh brought about a
breach of the bargain between Lord Hazard and Sir Sidney; for the latter had
propo&s;ed to the peer to wave &s;igning the writings, and take upon him&s;elf
the arrangements of Little Hockley. However, whether my lord felt the
&s;u|periority of Sir Sidney's qualifications for &s;uch an undertaking,
whether he thought it ridiculous to expect a harve&s;t of virtue where he had
only planted vice; whatever in &s;hort was the motive, he agreed only to return
to Warwick&s;hire with Sir Sidney, and give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
bargain, by which means the families would pa&s;s &s;ome months in the
&s;ociety of each other.</P>
<P>Even this was &s;ome acqui&s;ition, and Sir Sidney, in hopes of
enticing his lord&s;hip to follow his ex|ample, eagerly catched at the
propo&s;al. Schemes of plea&s;ure to be executed in the following &s;pring and
&s;ummer engro&s;&s;ed much of their conver&s;ation. Be&s;ides, Lady Hazard was
with child, and it was thought the country would be likely to re&s;tore her
&s;trength, after &s;he &s;hould have lain in; for &s;he was in general very
ill upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, and had never &s;ince Charles had a
child&mdash;though &s;he had borne in all four&mdash;that did not, after its
birth, pine away, and at length die.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="233"> Plea&s;ures were al&s;o chalked out for
Charles and Annette, who was under&s;tood to be Sir Sidney's daughter by a
former marriage, but that her mo|ther died abroad; and the baronet did not
&s;pare to hint that an union between the prince and prince&s;s of the two
rival villages might perhaps cement the general amne&s;ty between all
parties.</P>
<P>It will be ea&s;ily &s;een that Standfa&s;t felt awkward in this
&s;ociety. He too well knew Lady Roebuck's prudence, to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he
had acquainted Sir Sidney with any of his tricks, and as there &s;eemed no
coolne&s;s on the part of the baronet, the&s;e con|jectures were confirmed.
Thus, &s;uppo&s;ing the bu|&s;ine&s;s would be concluded in a &s;hort time
between his patron and Sir Sidney, he was &s;o far perfectly at ea&s;e; but
when he found the ladies were to be con|&s;ulted, he trembled for the
con&s;equence. How to act? Suppo&s;e he tried to prevent their meeting? but
that was dangerous and difficult. He once thought of hinting at a di&s;tance
that &s;omething had actually pa&s;&s;ed between him and the lady, which, if
credited, would account for any rancour in her; but, upon maturer reflection,
any of the&s;e would be to de&s;ert his own grand principle, which was, to be
always prepared with expedients, but never to u&s;e them except in ca&s;es of
emergency. It would be enough to defend him&s;elf when he &s;hould be
at|tacked; <PB N="199" REF="234"> and all things con&s;idered, &s;ince the lady
had evidently kept the grand point a &s;ecret from Sir Sidney, it was
po&s;&s;ible, though barely &s;o, that &s;he would not tattle to any one
el&s;e: yet that cur&s;ed female vanity&mdash;In &s;hort, the gentleman's
combat with him&s;elf continued a con&s;iderable while, till at length the
re&s;ult was that he &s;hould make an ex|cu&s;e to go out of town for a month,
and by that means gather from Lord Hazard's letters what was going forward.
Be&s;ides he had another rea&s;on for taking this re&s;olution&mdash;indeed he
had &s;everal rea&s;ons&mdash;which will in due time appear to the
reader:&mdash;&s;o, having imparted his intention to my lord, and got
permi&s;&s;ion for Charles to accompany him, the tutor and the pupil &s;et out
for the we&s;t of England, where bu&s;ine&s;s of a particular nature demanded
their pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Thus, mo&s;t of the arrangements before related pa&s;&s;ed in
the ab&s;ence of Standfa&s;t and Charles, whom, as their excur&s;ion has
&s;omething remarkable in it, we will join: after I have related a matter that
cur|&s;orily pa&s;&s;ed between the two ladies.</P>
<P>They were talking of Annette, and Lady Sidney, who was by no
means a&s;hamed of confe&s;&s;ing &s;o much of the truth as &s;aved the honour
of Mi&s;s Le Clerc, mentioned the matter exactly as it happened, &s;imply 
<PB N="200" REF="235"> with the addition of their being privately married. 
<Q REND="inline">'But,' &s;aid Lady Hazard, 'are you &s;ure that
the mother is dead?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Sure!' &s;aid Lady Roebuck, 'what doubt can
there be of that? Be&s;ides, at any rate, &s;he is dead to the world.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Perhaps not,' &s;aid the other lady. 'Good God,
have you any rea&s;on for what you &s;ay?'</Q> cried Lady Roebuck. Lady Hazard
here made a very &s;erious apology for her imprudence, &s;aying, the great
&s;imilarity between the &s;tory &s;he had heard from her lady&s;hip, and one
recently told her by my lord, had &s;truck her &s;o for|cibly, that &s;he had
unwarily betrayed her&s;elf into tho&s;e unguarded expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>This redoubled Lady Roebuck's anxiety, and &s;he entreated, in
the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to know what all this my&s;tery meant. 
<Q REND="inline">'Nay,' &s;aid Lady Hazard, if it be as I
conjecture, it mu&s;t be known, for the lady is determined to &s;ee Sir Sidney
before &s;he leaves England.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Who?&mdash;what lady?'&mdash;cried her friend,
'for heaven's &s;ake keep me no longer in &s;u&s;pence.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady Hazard, &s;eeing &s;he had advanced &s;o far, made no
&s;cruple of relating the whole &s;tory, as In|got told it to my lord, from
fir&s;t to la&s;t. When &s;he had fini&s;hed, Lady Roebuck a&s;ked the name of
the lady, which her friend confe&s;&s;ed &s;he did not know, 
<PB N="201" REF="236"> but &s;aid that it would be very ea&s;y to &s;atisfy
them|&s;elves by &s;ending to Mr. Ingot.</P>
<P>This was &s;carcely agreed on before Lady Roebuck received a
letter from her handmaid Emma, which the reader &s;hall have in her own words. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO LADY ROEBUCK.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU would not have heard from me &s;o &s;oon a|gain, but for
a circum&s;tance which wears &s;o much the air of a romance, that, had it not
been well cer|tified, I could not have believed it:&mdash;but 
<Q> 
<L>'Dark and my&s;terious are the ways of providence,</L> 
<L>'Puzzled with mazes, and perplexed with errors,'</L></Q>
As &s;ays my and Mr. VOLTAIRE's favourite Cato.&mdash;A lady called here who
cried over Mi&s;s Annette, and has left a crucifix and &s;everal popi&s;h
relics, which I cannot &s;ay plea&s;ed me, for I have hated the Roman catholics
ever &s;ince I read the account of the ma&s;&s;acre of the Hugunots, upon the
fea&s;t of St. Bartholomew. As to the holy war, &s;ome of the kings of England
were concerned in that, and there|fore <PB N="202" REF="237"> I &s;hall not be
&s;o wanting in loyalty as to men|tion it; el&s;e I could a tale
unfold:&mdash;But to return to the lady. There were two French gentlemen with
her, one of whom, in very bad broken En|gli&s;h, told me that he believed &s;he
had an impor|tant commi&s;&s;ion to execute, but he did not know the purport of
it. I wi&s;h I had under&s;tood French, I would have made her all her
pilgrimage relate, as faithfully as Othello did his. After &s;he was gone,
which was not till the gentleman had ki&s;&s;ed both my cheeks, I que&s;tioned
Mi&s;s concerning their conver&s;ation, and &s;he informed me that the lady was
that very &s;ame &s;he u&s;ed to call Mamma Le Clerc in the convent. The jewels
&s;he has left are for Sir Sidney, and as &s;he had not the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing him, &s;he did not think proper to leave a packet of papers, but
&s;aid &s;he would endeavour to find him in town, and there deliver it to
him.</P>
<P>Lord, my dear lady, what can be the meaning of all this?
Mi&s;s Annette was &s;o confu&s;ed and terrified, and indeed &s;he did not
under&s;tand her very well, for they &s;poke it &s;eems a different &s;ort of
French, our young lady having poli&s;hed hers, and that of the &s;tranger being
a good deal provincial: but, as I &s;aid, dear Mi&s;s's
confu&s;ion&mdash;though very learned writers have doubted whether this admits
of a genetive ca&s;e, and therefore, as I am proud to <PB N="203" REF="238">
yield to great authorities, I ought to &s;ay the confu|&s;ion of
Mi&s;s&mdash;was &s;o great, that &s;he had not the courage to a&s;k many
que&s;tions; &s;o I entreated her to go back and &s;peak to the French lady
again, who appeared greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find that Sir Sidney was married,
and when Mi&s;s Annette, at my de&s;ire, a&s;ked if &s;he was her mother, &s;he
replied that your lady&s;hip was now the only mother to whom &s;he owed any
duty, that &s;he hoped you would treat her kindly, and that Mi&s;s would repay
you with grati|tude.</P>
<P>My &s;weet little charge is very well, and comes on
&s;urpri&s;ingly. I entreated her not to write on this &s;ubject till I had
your advice. Her letter could not avoid falling into Sir Sidney's hands. This
will &s;eem only to concern hou&s;ehold affairs, and, as the poet &s;ays, 
<Q> 
<L>'E&s;cape the &s;cythe by being low.'</L></Q></P>
<P>I hate a fal&s;ity, but, without a little laudable de|ceit,
how can we guard again&s;t the evils of life?&mdash;Minerva thought duplicity
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the con|duct of her favourite Uly&s;&s;es, that &s;he
conde&s;cended to teach him that heroic quality her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I beg to know, my worthy lady, how I am to 
<PB N="204" REF="239"> act in this affair, and be a&s;&s;ured, in re&s;pect of
all the requi&s;ite feminine virtues, no Emma&mdash;from Prior's nut-brown maid
to Emma Corbet, can have a more exten&s;ive and proper &s;en&s;e than</P>
<CLOSER>
<SIGNED>Your very humble, And mo&s;t grateful handmaid, EMMA
DISTICH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter &s;eemed to clear up the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and it
being upon enquiry found that the name of the lady his lord&s;hip &s;aw at Mr.
Ingot's hou&s;e was Le Clerc, Lady Roebuck did not ballance a moment in her
mind, as to the probability of her being the mother of Annette.</P>
<P>In this exigence &s;he con&s;ulted Lady Hazard on what conduct
&s;he ought to pur&s;ue, who being, as we have &s;een, no friend to duplicity,
though even of that laudable kind recommended by Emma, ad|vi&s;ed her, without
delay, to inform Sir Sidney of the whole truth, telling her &s;he had
wonderfully well &s;ucceeded with her lord by the &s;ame mode of experiment
within the la&s;t fortnight.</P>
<P>This brought forward the &s;tory of Mi&s;s Snaffle, which the
reader has &s;een &s;o fully inve&s;tigated, and <PB N="205" REF="240"> which
not being told without the highe&s;t enco|miums on Mr. Standfa&s;t's attachment
and integrity, and an information that his lord&s;hip had &s;ettled an
additional annuity on him, Lady Roebuck te&s;|tified the greate&s;t
&s;urpri&s;e, which Lady Hazard perceiving, &s;aid, you may well &s;hudder at
the world's villany. I wi&s;h I could prevail with my lord to embrace Sir
Sidney's offer, that I might live always with you in retirement.</P>
<P>Lady Roebuck, who&s;e &s;hudderings had been at hearing of
Standfa&s;t's great influence in the family, was upon the point of &s;aying
&s;omething which might have led to an inve&s;tigation of his conduct, not very
favourable to that gentleman; but finding Lady Hazard had given her
&s;urpri&s;e another motive, &s;he contented her&s;elf for the pre&s;ent with
falling in with that lady's conjectures, and &s;imply remarking that indeed the
expectations of villains were &s;o ina|dequate to the pains they took, and the
ri&s;ks they run, that &s;he wondered men became knaves to be infamous, when,
by only being hone&s;t, they might be happy.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE HERO CLEARED A LITTLE FROM THE COBWEBS OF THE LIBRARY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I MAKE no &s;cruple to confe&s;s that my leaving the
bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi&s;s Le Clerc and the po&s;&s;ibility of Standfa&s;t's
detection in &s;uch a &s;tate of uncertainty as they appeared to be at the end
of the la&s;t chapter, is taking a liberty with the reader, and, what is
wor&s;e, with the ladies. But the con&s;ideration of having &s;o long forborne
to introduce my hero, who, by the way, would be the la&s;t to excu&s;e me for
be|ing guilty of the &s;malle&s;t incivility to the fair &s;ex, has got the
better of all others:&mdash;for indeed the circum&s;tances in this hi&s;tory
are &s;o various, and follow in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that really if I
do not u&s;e &s;ome expedition to bring him forward, I might as well have no
hero at all. Ju&s;t &s;o far how|ever I have nothing to reproach my&s;elf with;
for, though hitherto he has &s;aid very little, I can a&s;&s;ure the reader he
has thought a great deal. To what purpo&s;e will hereafter appear. At pre&s;ent
I &s;hall proceed to the examination of his good and bad qualities, a portion
of each&mdash;for I am afraid there is nothing perfect in this world&mdash;he
certainly had; <PB N="207" REF="242"> and having cleared away the &s;hores, and
made every other proper preparation&mdash;for we may well give him fair
play&mdash;fairly launch him on the ocean of life, where we &s;hall &s;ee him
&s;teming many adver&s;e gales of fortune, in which it will be difficult to
de|termine whether mo&s;t to admire his di&s;tre&s;s or his fortitude.</P>
<P>I certainly had &s;ome apprehen&s;ions that having &s;uffered a
fourth part of this work to pa&s;s without approaching to &s;uch a
nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, the reader might perhaps be given to imagine that I
called Charles Hazard the hero out of facetiou&s;ne&s;s, and merely by
inference and deduction, and &s;o u&s;e him as a painter does a layman, which
&s;tands in all the attitudes, bears the helmet, drapery, or poll parrot of the
hero or heroine, and yet, though he play this re&s;pectable part, is never
known per&s;onally to the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, I have often been wickedly in|clined to
wi&s;h that many heroes I have met with in my life had been &s;o dealt with,
and it is not impo&s;|&s;ible but &s;ome of my readers may retort the
cour|te&s;y; for it &s;o happens that particular people find in the&s;e &s;aid
heroes particular qualities, which ge|nerally being adventitious, it is fifty
to one if a hero-maker thinks of them, and, in the ab&s;ence of the&s;e 
<PB N="208" REF="243"> qualities, though the gentleman &s;hould be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ever &s;o long a catalogue of real and permanent virtues,
he &s;inks to a nonentity, in the opinion of &s;uch critics, becau&s;e he does
not happen to be en|livened with their favourite animating principle.</P>
<P>I cannot give a &s;tronger in&s;tance of what I have advanced
than by producing the names of two of the greate&s;t men in their way that ever
lived:&mdash;I mean ALEXANDER of Macedon the great warrior, and A|LEXANDER of
Twickenham the great poet.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER the warrior would not have given three-pence for all
the noi&s;y applau&s;e and bellowing acclamations of the large&s;t populace
that ever a&s;|&s;embled, if they had not hailed him &s;on of Jupiter; and
ALEXANDER the poet&mdash;according to Dr. JOHN|SON&mdash;continually made
him&s;elf wretched le&s;t the world &s;hould fancy him to be the &s;on of
nobody; yet I appeal to any one if the fighting hero had been the offspring of
a beggar, and the writing hero the heir of a king, whether one would have cut
throats, or the other 
<Q REND="inline">'li&s;ped numbers'</Q> in greater perfection.
Neither of the&s;e could conquer his favourite foible, which it is admirable to
remark proceeded in the warrior from hope, and in the poet from fear. This
imaginary honour in one, and blot in the other, nothing could efface; for
vainly did ALEXANDER's <PB N="209" REF="244"> mother ridicule the
prepo&s;terous folly of her &s;on, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">'hu&s;h, hu&s;h, my dear boy, you don't
con|&s;ider you are bringing me into a &s;crape, for if you talk &s;o loud
about being the &s;on of Jupiter, you will make Juno angry with
me:'</Q>&mdash;and equally un&s;ucce&s;sful were the efforts of POPE's friends,
who it is &s;aid told him it was ridiculous to lament that he was the &s;on of
a trade&s;man, when the father of ESCHINES, the Socratic philo&s;opher, was but
a &s;au&s;age-maker.</P>
<P>A hundred in&s;tances may be adduced, perhaps a thou&s;and, to
prove upon what cobweb qualities the very e&s;&s;ence of a hero often depends;
but none I believe can be found &s;tronger than tho&s;e I have given. Let us
then &s;ettle the di&s;pute in this way: Let all matters relative to Charles
Hazard, which are totally dependant upon chance, be con&s;idered as out of his
power to alter or amend, and all qua|lities, good, bad, or indifferent, which
are the re|&s;ult of his &s;erious reflections, be under&s;tood as his act and
deed, and cen&s;ured or prai&s;ed accordingly.</P>
<P>Charles had been left from his infancy in the quiet and
unwearied pur&s;uit of every u&s;eful and ele|gant accompli&s;hment. All
the&s;e advantages had been procured for him at home, under a tutor who
cer|tainly had &s;ome ta&s;te, and a father who had more; <PB N="210" REF="245"> both of whom were perfectly well &s;atisfied with his progre&s;s.
His ardour had been &s;o unremitting, that perfection, by the help of
per&s;everence, &s;eemed to be within his reach. I therefore left him to
him|&s;elf, for why &s;hould I interrupt him in the mid&s;t of &s;o laudable a
career?&mdash;e&s;pecially when tho&s;e very advantages are good
recommendations to the reader.</P>
<P>Having untied him, however, a little from his mother's apron
&s;trings, I &s;hall now fairly tru&s;t him to the bent of his
inclination:&mdash;and this for &s;everal good rea&s;ons:&mdash;one is, that my
veracity as a hi&s;to|rian obliges me to it, for Standfa&s;t declared to
Vi|ney, before he &s;et out&mdash;fir&s;t indeed giving him &s;ome other
in&s;tructions&mdash;he &s;hould try what mettle the young&s;ter was made
of.</P>
<P>Charles was at this time &s;omething more than &s;eventeen, &s;o
that he took the field young, as did his name&s;ake of Sweden. He was not,
however, at all like that great man in any re&s;pect, except in|deed that no
Charles the Twelfth upon earth could be a more rigid ob&s;erver of his word;
for, as the Swedi&s;h Charles could never be per&s;waded by any body, the
Engli&s;h Charles placed an implicit faith in every body, and as the fighting

no better re|ward. His propen&s;ity to the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions were, though
&s;o young, of a pretty robu&s;t kind, for he had already attacked, and that

her virtue. Nor was he le&s;s &s;olicitous with Lady Ha|zard's woman, before

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT BUNDLING AND OTHER AMCROUS MATTERS.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>STANDFAST's journey into the country was to the hou&s;e of a
young clergyman, to whom he was pa|tron. Read it ye great, and confe&s;s your
in&s;igni|ficance. Your dependants have their hangers on; your very toad-eaters
have their tools: nay, &s;ome|times, you are their tools your&s;elves. Has not
your &s;teward his carriage, his country hou&s;e, his hounds, his partridge
mews, and his doxey? and do not you pay for it? Nay he is, in point of
certainty, &s;o much better off than you, that, were you to be ruined, and even
through his mi&s;management, he could behold the wreck from the &s;hore, and
get comfortably to a retreat which your bounty pro|vided for him.</P>
<P>This young clergyman, who&s;e name was Figgins, was originally a
Bridewell boy. Standfa&s;t took a great fancy to him one evening, as he
&s;ignalized him&s;elf on a rejoicing night. The peculiar addre&s;s with which
he broke the windows of &s;uch as would not put out lights, and threw &s;quibs
into coaches to frighten ladies, and burn their cloaths, evinced 
<PB N="216" REF="251"> &s;uch a pronene&s;s to mi&s;chief, that Standfa&s;t
felt a congenial warmth, and immediately determined to &s;elect this youth as a
fit in&s;trument, in time, for nobler daring.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that he &s;hould add to this
unluckine&s;s and audacity a nece&s;&s;ary portion of &s;ubtilty. He therefore
a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions, to which he received &s;uch an&s;wers as
plea&s;ed him; that is to &s;ay, full of impudence and ambiguity: and hearing
him afterwards tell one of his compa|nions that he had queered Raven Grey, his
mind was &s;o made up that he determined&mdash;to u&s;e his own
phra&s;e&mdash;upon patronizing him.</P>
<P>The reader however mu&s;t not imagine that Mr. Standfa&s;t laid
him&s;elf open to his dependant; the matter was apparently brought about
through the medium of a third per&s;on, indeed Mr. Viney, to whom this hopeful
youth was a di&s;tant relation, and he was required, among other things, to
con&s;ider Mr. Standfa&s;t as an exemplary character.</P>
<P>The tutor prevailed upon a bi&s;hop, a friend of his&mdash;I
&s;incerely hope the bi&s;hop did not know what he was about&mdash;to ordain
this &s;park; and this was the very friend he left in the care of Little
Hockley.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="252"> At the time Charles and his tutor paid
this vi&s;it to Mr. Figgins, he was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a vica|rage
near Poole, which living Standfa&s;t procured him from a noble earl, in &s;ome
re&s;pects however owing to the young par&s;on's own conduct, for he was &s;o
civil to introduce to his lord&s;hip a near re|lation, which circum&s;tance
ended in my lord's making up, for a large &s;um of money, a &s;uit which the
young lady commenced again&s;t him for &s;educ|tion, though the earl was about
her thirteenth lover. One of this number, by her advice, quitted the kingdom
le&s;t he &s;hould be taken up for the forgery of a bank note, which, after he
was gone, &s;he changed, and put the money in her pocket.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t's bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Figgins was of a very
particular nature, and perhaps the reader may &s;ometime hence join with me in
that opinion.&mdash;Whatever it was, Standfa&s;t did not chu&s;e to tran&s;act
it by letter, it being one of his maxims never to write any thing but what all
the world might read, nor make either promi&s;es or declarations in the
pre|&s;ence of a third per&s;on.</P>
<P>In conformity to this latter part of his maxim, he very
frequently took his friend Figgins with him either a walk or a ride, begging
Charles to take care of the ladies till their return. The&s;e ladies 
<PB N="218" REF="253"> were, fir&s;t Mr. Figgins's maiden aunt, a woman of
exemplary character, an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of Drelincourt and a dram
gla&s;s, and who her nephew very humanely maintained, upon her paying him down
quarterly the &s;um of eight pounds. Secondly Mrs. Figgins the ninth&mdash;for,
like Major O'Flaherty, he had them in all quarters, and all alive and
merry;&mdash;and, la&s;tly, Mi&s;s Figgins, a young lady of beauty and
accompli&s;hments, but who had not yet got a hu&s;band&mdash;though &s;he owned
twenty-&s;even&mdash;becau&s;e the men were brutes, and her nature was &s;o
delicate that the lea&s;t ill treatment would break her heart.</P>
<P>Charles found it no di&s;agreeable ta&s;k to entertain the&s;e
ladies, in the ab&s;ence of his tutor; nay he made a traffic of his
complai&s;ance, for he wrote an impromtu for a &s;mile, and &s;ketched their
portrait for a ki&s;s. His &s;kill in mu&s;ic enchanted them, and they wi&s;hed
never to part with the young lord, as he was called.</P>
<P>As to Mi&s;s Figgins, had any one witne&s;&s;ed her behaviour at
tho&s;e unguarded moments when he &s;ung a pathetic air&mdash;though, by the
bye, he was of that age when the voice &s;ounds more like that of a raven than
a nightingale&mdash;he would have &s;worn &s;he had at once conquered her
aver&s;ion to love and ma|trimony. <PB N="219" REF="254"> To &s;ay truth, her
virtue was of the ram|pant kind, which perhaps was one rea&s;on &s;he
con|tinually talked of the great pains &s;he took to &s;ubdue it. Indeed &s;he
&s;o prompted Charles in that part, which, if it had been the time to act, he
knew with|out a cue, that the young gentleman had a kind of rebellion to quell,
which gave him no little di&s;tur|bance. In &s;hort, in &s;pight of his teeth
he was obliged to take a review of the promi&s;e he had made his father, and
reflecting that the &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Fig|gins mu&s;t certainly be a woman of
honour, he tri|umphantly carried the point, and congratulated him&s;elf on this
victory over his pa&s;&s;ions. Indeed the term &s;i&s;ter was not included in
the conditions, but it was certainly implied, and it would have been
di&s;honourable had he taken advantage of the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The lady however having made good her land|ing, determined to
lo&s;e no opportunity of improv|ing that advantage; therefore, one day, while
they &s;at at dinner, &s;he &s;lily &s;lipt a note into the young gentleman's
coat pocket, which contained the&s;e words both in form and &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'For hevven &s;ake mete mee in the arburr, and
lett mee, ho lett mee, unbuzzum my&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="255"> Charles was too gallant not to attend the
lady.&mdash;Indeed it was very much his wi&s;h to have a little conver&s;ation
with her alone; not doubting but when the purity of his intentions were
hone&s;tly made known, the young lady's quiet would be re&s;tored, which at
pre&s;ent he made no doubt he greatly di&s;|turbed. Having therefore attended
the appoint|ment, he declared to her with the true&s;t and mo&s;t hone&s;t
&s;implicity, his repugnance to do that which he could not con&s;ider
otherwi&s;e than as a &s;hameful breach of ho&s;pitality. The lady acknowledged
the genero&s;ity of his &s;entiments, and &s;aid, that as &s;he &s;aw her fears
were unnece&s;&s;ary, they might now in|dulge in all tho&s;e little innocent
freedoms which to &s;u&s;ceptible and delicate hearts gave &s;uch
delight.&mdash;In &s;hort, after much &s;impering, &s;tammering, blu&s;h|ing,
and other indications of maiden ba&s;hfulne&s;s&mdash;the large&s;t part of
which, e&s;pecially the blu&s;hing, was mo&s;t manife&s;t in
Charles&mdash;&s;he informed him that, upon certain conditions, he &s;hould
&s;teal to her bedchamber, and &s;leep with her that very night. The&s;e
conditions were explained to be exactly what I am informed they practi&s;e very
commonly, and very innocently in America, under the name of bundling.</P>
<P>Perhaps Mi&s;s Figgins had heard of Adhelm, who, to try his
virtue, &s;lept &s;everal nights with a <PB N="221" REF="256"> virgin without
violating his cha&s;tity, and under|&s;tanding Charles was intended for a great
man, de|termined it &s;hould not be her fault if he had not this proof of his
virtue in as great perfection as his pious predece&s;&s;or. If however the&s;e
were her intentions, there was &s;ome how or other an infraction in the treaty,
for Charles and the lady &s;o bundled that, at the end of a fortnight, &s;he
informed him, in the mo&s;t decent manner &s;o delicate a creature could
mu&s;ter up words for the purpo&s;e, that &s;he was certainly with child.</P>
<P>What a &s;troke for our hero! Mu&s;t he begin al|ready to feel
the bitter reflections of having broken his promi&s;e. How to act? Which way to
conceal her &s;hame? He could not marry her&mdash;which at &s;ome intervals he
had thoughts of&mdash;without con&s;ult|ing his father, and the con&s;equence
of &s;uch a con|&s;ultation was apparent. Yet he had ruined her, and brought
her into a &s;ituation that marriage alone could atone for. In &s;o doing he
had already broken his promi&s;e, and why not go farther, &s;ince there was no
honourable means of retreat.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, chequered with plea&s;ure and com|punction, had
he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days, when Mr. Standfa&s;t one morning told our hero
that &s;ome damned thing or other had come to his fatheris ears, 
<PB N="222" REF="257"> who required their immediate pre&s;ence in town.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'See there,'</Q> &s;aid he, &s;hewing him a
letter he had that in&s;tant received.

</LETTER></P>
<P>Charles not doubting but his amour and its con|&s;equences had
already reached his father's ears, without con&s;idering how the intelligence
could have been conveyed, told his tutor ingenuou&s;ly that he was the cau&s;e
of it. Mr. Standfa&s;t &s;eemed greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at the declaration, and
demanded how it could po&s;&s;ibly be? The pupil exacting a &s;olemn promi&s;e
from his tutor that he would carefully pre|&s;erve the mo&s;t profound
&s;ecre&s;y, let him into the bundling &s;ecret from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and
concluded with vehemently entreating his advice.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t looking very &s;agacious, &s;aid this mu&s;t be the
cau&s;e of Lord Hazard's injunction &s;ure enough, which it was a very proper
thing to com|ply with, for fear of irritating him farther. As for the re&s;t,
he &s;aid it was a cur&s;ed unlucky affair, but <PB N="223" REF="258">
fortunately the brother was under his thumb, and his be&s;t endeavours might be
depended on to hu&s;h matters up.</P>
<P>If his father &s;hould mention it, he advi&s;ed Charles to deny
the whole bu&s;ine&s;s; though he had no doubt but he &s;hould u&s;e &s;uch
arguments as would induce him not to &s;ay a word about it.</P>
<P>Charles was in raptures at the kindne&s;s of his tu|tor, who
took care neverthele&s;s to give the young gentleman a whole&s;ome lecture,
declaring his great repugnance to this duplicity of conduct, and pro|te&s;ting
he only con&s;ented to it from the laudable view of preventing a difference
between father and &s;on.</P>
<P>By this time the chai&s;e was at the door; for Standfa&s;t,
zealous to obey his patron's mandate, had ordered it previous to this
conver&s;ation with his pupil. The latter therefore took a ha&s;ty, but ten|der
leave of his enamorata, who exacted a promi&s;e that he would write to her,
and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ee her &s;oon again.</P>
<P>On the road, Standfa&s;t encouraged Charles to keep up his
&s;pirits. He told him, for one thing, that his honour was in no &s;crape; for
that the lady, how|ever <PB N="224" REF="259"> &s;he might have impo&s;ed upon
his inexperience, was not a ve&s;tal, nor had been for a good twenty years.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Why &s;he is but &s;ix and twenty,' &s;aid
Charles:</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'and eleven added to it,' replied the tutor. 'As
to the brat, if there &s;hould be one, we mu&s;t &s;ee what's to be done with
it. I have told you all the&s;e matters,' added he, 'le&s;t you &s;hould be
im|properly drawn in, therefore you mu&s;t promi&s;e me to be upon your guard.
No indi&s;creet marri|ages, nor any other &s;teps without fir&s;t con&s;ulting
me. Upon the&s;e and no other terms will I un|dertake this
bu&s;ine&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles eagerly promi&s;ed every thing his tutor demanded of
him, and Standfa&s;t reiterated his friend|ly profe&s;&s;ions. They both
arrived in town however with no little anxiety on their minds. That of Charles
proceeded, as the reader knows, from his fear of having made his father
mi&s;erable. Mr. Stand|fa&s;t had too hearty a contempt for every human
weak|ne&s;s to feel the influence of any &s;uch hen-hearted &s;en&s;ation.
Glorious mi&s;chief begat his perplexity, and all his unea&s;ine&s;s was le&s;t
the banquet preparing for his inexorable &s;en&s;es &s;hould not be

<Q REND="inline">'Heaven <PB N="229" REF="264"> and earth,' cried
my lord, 'you have certainly divined the truth; it is that diabolical wretch
&s;ure enough: who el&s;e could have taken &s;uch unheard of pains to make me
mi&s;erable? I knew, I felt, thou would&s;t comfort me. But &s;till is not the
ca|lamity the &s;ame, my dear Standfa&s;t?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'Not at all my lord,' an&s;wered his kind friend
very con|fidently. 'Are you &s;ure of what you &s;ay in relation to your
lady?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'From what I may rea&s;onably conjecture it
mu&s;t be &s;o,' &s;aid my lord. 'Oh God! if I could but flatter my&s;elf
there.'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Well, well, hope for the be&s;t,' cried
Standfa&s;t. 'You forget my lord how artfully the &s;nare was laid for you. I
am &s;ure if your lord&s;hip was off your guard, there is no prudence but may
be &s;urpri&s;ed. My advice is this: If, for the &s;ake of your lady's health,
matters &s;hould require an explanation, hone&s;tly give it her, and lay the
blame upon Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y; I would &s;take my life upon the i&s;|&s;ue. And
now my lord throw off your chagrin; I dare &s;ay your lady knows no
unea&s;ine&s;s upon this &s;ubject but that which &s;he has felt from &s;eeing
you mi&s;erable.'</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'She &s;hall &s;ee me &s;o no longer then,'
&s;aid my lord. 'By imitating thee I will grow hone&s;t, and that &s;hall teach
me to be chearful.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="265"> Having &s;o far adju&s;ted matters, Lord
Hazard felt him&s;elf wonderfully relieved. As for Charles, all he could learn
from his mother was, that her lord had, for &s;everal days, appeared very ill
and very unea&s;y; that it certainly was cau&s;ed by &s;ome di&s;agreeable news
he had heard; 
<Q REND="inline">'but,' continued &s;he, 'whatever it is, we
mu&s;t unite to comfort him. I am &s;ure from me he de&s;erves every thing, for
his affection encrea&s;es every day.'</Q></P>
<P>Charles, convinced he was the cau&s;e of his fa|ther's
unhappine&s;s, took leave of his mother as early as he decently could, to go in
que&s;t of Stand|fa&s;t, that common friend in the family: for &s;urely it is
the office of a friend to make people ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The tutor was ready to receive him, and appa|rently anxious to
put him out of pain, for he &s;eized him very cordially by the hand, and told
him mat|ters were in &s;uch a &s;wimming train, that he had only to appear as
if nothing had happened, and he might be a&s;&s;ured that his father would not
even mention the circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t had now re&s;tored the tranquility of both father
and &s;on, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure his own; for the latter part of his
conver&s;ation with his patron was concerning Lady Roebuck, but as he could not
<PB N="231" REF="266"> gather any rea&s;on to believe &s;he had been tatling,
he fairly concluded &s;he was afraid to attack him, or el&s;e perhaps, as
chance had thrown him again in her way, the lady had wi&s;ely adopted the
proverb better late than never; and &s;o promi&s;ed her&s;elf the
accom|pli&s;hment of what his vanity induced him to believe &s;he wi&s;hed:
&s;o difficult is it for men of Mr. Stand|fa&s;t's turn of mind to credit that
any one can be actuated by motives purely generous, and merely
di&s;intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>The triumphant Mr. Standfa&s;t however had never been &s;o near
detection as while he was ab&s;ent. That conver&s;ation between the two ladies
which took a different turn, as the reader has &s;een, at the end of the
&s;eventh chapter, had introduced into the mind of Lady Roebuck a number of
alarming fears for her friend. She could not give Mr. Standfa&s;t that implicit
credit which he &s;eemed to exact of Lord and Lady Hazard, for the active part
he had taken in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi&s;s Snaffle. Indeed, knowing from her
own experience how little preten&s;ions he had either to gratitude, principle,
or genero&s;ity, her tongue was very reluctantly reined in whenever &s;he heard
any thing in his commendation; but at length, con&s;idering Lady Hazard was a
new, though a very intimate acquaintance, and that the office &s;he longed to
undertake was rather a thankle&s;s one, &s;he took a <PB N="232" REF="267">
little time for reflection, during which interval a circum&s;tance happened
which decided her wavering re&s;olution. As however it was of &s;ufficient
con&s;e|quence to require that Sir Sidney &s;hould be con&s;ult|ed, the reader
is of cour&s;e anxious to know what it was, and the re&s;ult of their
deliberations. The latter I am very ready to &s;ay was, that to arm Lord and
Lady Hazard again&s;t the machinations of Mr. Standfa&s;t was treading on very
tender ground, and therefore they ought not to take any material &s;teps in
&s;o weighty a bu&s;ine&s;s till their arrival in the coun|try, where Sir
Sidney &s;aid he would begin this Her|culean labour. This then they re&s;olved.
As to the circum&s;tance which procured this re&s;olution, it will come better
hereafter. To have mentioned it here would have been premature, and not to have
&s;aid &s;omething on the &s;u&s;picions of Sir Sidney and his lady, would have
been tacitly to have accu&s;ed the reader of a deficiency in penetration, for
it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that any one who knew Mr. Standfa&s;t &s;hould
believe him capable of devoting him&s;elf &s;o &s;uddenly to the practi&s;e of
real virtue, when his whole life had been an artful &s;tudy how to keep up the
ap|pearance of it.</P>
<P>Standfa&s;t has been &s;een very &s;olicitous to get at the
particulars of Lord Hazard's unfortunate in|trigue, for which I have
a&s;&s;igned the real motive; <PB N="233" REF="268"> and, to &s;ay truth, he
was not plea&s;ed with the rela|tion: for in his ab&s;ence&mdash;to carry on
the allu&s;ion I u&s;ed at that time&mdash;his peice had been mutilated by the
managers, and ill performed by the actors; a ma|terial incident had been cut
out of his projecting, and another, by no means condu&s;ive to the
cata&s;tro|phe he wi&s;hed to take place, introduced.&mdash;The&s;e
al|terations were principally owing to the heroine, who in real life, as well
as upon the &s;tage, is generally apt to take the&s;e &s;ort of liberties; and
though Mr. Standfa&s;t had not been pre&s;ent at the repre&s;entation of his
performance, yet, being a con&s;ummate judge of effect, he &s;aw plainly it
would have had more &s;triking &s;ucce&s;s could he have been on the &s;pot to
have conducted it.</P>
<P>To drop this allu&s;ion, Standfa&s;t plainly &s;aw that Mrs.
O'Shockne&s;y had taken the liberty to alter his plan, no doubt for private
ends of her own. He had left orders for an anonymous letter to be &s;ent to
Lady Hazard on the very evening his lord&s;hip &s;hould be engaged at
Snaffle's, apprizing her of the fact. This, it was plain to Standfa&s;t, had
been neglected; but that &s;omething, as we before ob|&s;erved, &s;hould be
&s;ub&s;tituted in its place, the lady had, through the means of Mi&s;s
Snaffle, conferred a favour on his lord&s;hip which &s;he thought would &s;erve
ju&s;t as well to communicate the &s;ecret to Lady <PB N="234" REF="269">
Hazard. To &s;ay truth, this was a <HI>coup de grace</HI> which Standfa&s;t,
with all his ra&s;callity, had not me|ditated. It was a vengeance truly
feminine, and greatly worthy the vindictive Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y.&mdash;How
the&s;e con&s;pirators an&s;wered their conduct to their ringleader will by and
by be &s;een. At pre|&s;ent I &s;hall only &s;ay that Mrs. O'Shockne&s;y
defended her&s;elf by an argument which will at lea&s;t prove her to be a
proper coadjutor of the great Mr. Stand|fa&s;t. It was no le&s;s than that the
knowledge of Lady Hazard's pregnancy induced her to take that harmle&s;s &s;tep
before mentioned, without her prin|cipal's privity; at which he was as much
incenced as was Hecate again&s;t the witches, who dared to prompt Macbeth in
his iniquity without her orders.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>PERMANENT HAPPINESS APPEARS TO BE RESTORED, AND THE WHOLE
SOCIETY SET OUT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE COUNTRY.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT will now be proper to &s;peak concerning Mi&s;s Le Clerc,
who&s;e whole hi&s;tory, as far as Mr. Ingot knew it, Sir Sidney learnt much
about the time the two ladies were reading Emma's letter; for the good citizen
being, as I ob&s;erved, Lord Hazard's man of bu&s;ine&s;s, they were in a
manner obliged to con&s;ult him upon &s;everal points relative to the pro|perty
of Little Hockley. On the fir&s;t of the&s;e vi&s;its every thing naturally
came out, and when the ba|ronet and his lady met, both were ripe for the
di&s;|covery of what was no &s;ecret to either.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Annette was no my&s;tery, but it has been &s;hewn
in what way it was told; and if Mi&s;s Le Clerc was Sir Sidney's wife, what
then was Lady Roebuck? This was a con&s;ideration of a mo&s;t &s;e|rious
nature, and, in ju&s;tice to &s;o amiable a lady, it was admitted that it ought
to be &s;et to rights.&mdash;Lord and Lady Hazard being therefore the only
per&s;ons who had it in their power to make a &s;ingle <PB N="236" REF="271">
comment on this &s;ubject, and that nobleman and his lady having by this time,
for many rea&s;ons, be|come great favourites with the&s;e two friends, they
were, without the alteration of a &s;ingle circum|&s;tance, informed of the
real truth. This led to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mo&s;t intimate and binding
friend|&s;hip between the two couples, and the baronet and Lady Roebuck
felicitated them&s;elves upon the cer|tainty, as they now conceived it, of that
plan which they had formed of making Lord Hazard the re|former of his own
village. As preaching however cannot have half the effect of example, they
re&s;olved, as the reader has &s;een, to re&s;erve their grand attack till they
&s;hould arrive at the place of action, when his lord&s;hip &s;hould be
a&s;&s;ailed in &s;uch a manner as would deprive him of the means of defending
him|&s;elf, and oblige him&mdash;e&s;pecially as his lady was al|ready gained
over&mdash;to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard very &s;oon got perfectly re&s;tored to health, and
as there were no rea&s;ons to believe that his &s;u&s;picions concerning his
lady had any founda|tion, he by degrees regained his u&s;ual ea&s;e and
tran|quility.</P>
<P>As to Charles, he received a quire of letters from Mi&s;s
Figgins, full of <HI>&s;ythes and wows, and flamming arts;</HI> but, convinced
that under the guidance of <PB N="237" REF="272"> Standfa&s;t, all he incurred
was a trifling expence, he rather felt proud of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and was not a
little plea&s;ed that, at an age under eighteen, he had given &s;uch notable
proofs of his manhood. He felt however very gratefully towards both his
parents, who he was convinced knew of his irregularity, and had the kindne&s;s
not to upbraid him with it; and, as this imaginary conduct of theirs induced
him to treat them with the mo&s;t dutiful and minute atten|tion, &s;o it
endeared him to their notice and regard ten times &s;tronger than ever. Sir
Sidney was not an idle &s;pectator of this. He was charmed with Charles, and
really began to meditate &s;eriou&s;ly that alliance which it may be
recollected he mentioned formerly in je&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e projects, which were intended to blo&s;&s;om in the
&s;pring, and produce fruit in the &s;ummer, laid at pre&s;ent dormant in their
minds; we will there|fore pa&s;s over the hurry of the winter, and bring them
to the &s;ign of the John of Gaunt's Head, an inn in their way to
Warwick&s;hire.</P>
<P>The landlord of this hou&s;e, who was a great fa|vourite of Sir
Sidney, prided him&s;elf on having as di&s;tinct and ample a genealogy as any
lord; nay he looked upon him&s;elf as &s;uperior to many who boa&s;t that
title: for, &s;aid he, 
<Q REND="inline">'What are lords, the crea|tures 
<PB N="238" REF="273"> of ye&s;terday, to tho&s;e in my family of three hundred
years &s;tanding?' adding, 'alack a day! human creatures are buckets in a well,
one up, and tother down.'</Q></P>
<P>This landlord was not a little proud of having been a
&s;ub&s;tantial yeoman of Kent. He had been indeed a con&s;iderable farmer, but
having a &s;trong inclination to indulge him&s;elf in that ho&s;pitality in
which it was not within his circum&s;tances to cut any tolerable figure, he had
entertained &s;o many poor gentlemen of high extraction, till at length, as the
phra&s;e is, he ran out; and, leaving off farming, left al&s;o his own country,
and took an inn not far from High Wickham.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e bore all the in&s;ignia of its ma&s;ter's fan|cied
con&s;equence, and the reliques of tho&s;e mighty deeds which were performed by
his ance&s;tors, and in which he took &s;o much plea&s;ure, as he &s;at in his
chimney corner, to record, were di&s;tributed about wherever he could find a
place for them. Shields and &s;pears glittered in the kitchen in&s;tead of
pot|lids and &s;pits; helmets and cui&s;&s;es, in the place of &s;tag's horns,
adorned the hall, and mi&s;matched pieces of tape&s;try covered the walls of
every room.</P>
<P>Lord Hazard in&s;i&s;ted upon being introduced in 
<PB N="239" REF="274"> form, and Sir Sidney undertook to be gentleman u&s;her
upon the occa&s;ion. My lord confe&s;&s;ed he could boa&s;t but of very recent
extraction, being, as one might &s;ay, a junior branch of the nobility. 
<Q REND="inline">'Why truly' an&s;wered the landlord, 'you will
pardon my jocularity my lord, there is a &s;pot of <HI>Ru&s;t</HI> on your
e&s;chuteon which perhaps, by <HI>Hazard,</HI> may be rubbed out.'</Q></P>
<P>The archne&s;s as well as frankne&s;s of this reply plea&s;ed
his lord&s;hip &s;o much, that he entered into a long conver&s;ation with the
landlord, that ended in an explanation of all the warlike trophies before
mentioned, the hi&s;tory of which contained a kind of &s;ummary review of the
hi&s;tory of England; we &s;hall therefore forbear to recite any part of what
pa&s;&s;ed, except one remark. They were examining a ro|&s;ary, which was
&s;aid to have belonged to the un|fortunate Mary, Queen of Scots. My lord
&s;aid that her's was a lamentable fate. 
<Q REND="inline">'Lamentable,' &s;aid the landlord, &s;haking his

&s;o ready to &s;end her to make one in heaven.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A NIGHT SCENE, WHICH MR. FLUSH WOULD HAVE CALLED A VERY
VARIETOUS KIND OF A THING.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the inn where our travellers lay had arrived two mu&s;icians,
ju&s;t before dark, who were going to a nobleman's &s;cat in the neighbourhood,
upon a &s;ummer excur&s;ion, and where there was to be a grand concert the next
day. One of the gentlemen, an Italian, had the day before been &s;eized with a
vio|lent fever, but being told that his patron had &s;ent expre&s;s for him, he
determined to go in &s;pight of his indi&s;po&s;ition, e&s;pecially as he knew
he &s;hould be taken greater care of at the hou&s;e of his benefac|tor than at
home. His companion came to ac|quaint him that he had received a &s;imilar
&s;ummons. This put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the Italian's deter|mination;
for they were both famous performers on the trumpet, and &s;eldom played
a&s;under.</P>
<P>At this meeting the two mu&s;icians talked about what fi&s;hing
and &s;hooting they &s;hould have, and, above all, what delicious burgundy they
&s;hould ta&s;te at his lord&s;hip's; nor did they fail to enjoy, by
an|ticipation, certain jokes which the Italian, being <PB N="241" REF="276"> a
wag, had it in contemplation to play &s;ome of his lord&s;hip's retinue. One in
particular he concerted, which was to ridicule a black &s;ervant, for whom the
Italian had an inveterate aver&s;ion, becau&s;e he could not blow the french
horn in tune. 
<Q REND="inline">'Perdio' cried he 'I tink I &s;ee de villain
cavaliero vid his vite or&s;e and plack vi&s;age make one tammed ni&s;e oh
Diavo|lo.'</Q> For it &s;hould here be known that his lord|&s;hip, though he
had con&s;tantly a troop of mu&s;icians after him, and &s;ome of them men of
di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, would rather have been called in at the death of a
fox, by the di&s;&s;onant belching of his fa|vourite horn, than have li&s;tened
to the be&s;t chorus of HANDEL, performed by five hundred and fifty-three
per&s;ons, capable of realizing all that cele&s;tial rapture of which Doctor
BURNEY dreamt.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mu&s;ician took his leave of the Italian
recommending him to take as much re&s;t as po&s;&s;ible before they &s;hould
&s;et off. In conformity with this advice, the Italian betook him&s;elf to
&s;leep, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in tolerable tranquility, except that he had
a &s;light delirium, in which he fancied the above mentioned black pur&s;ued
him, on his white hor&s;e, and that he e&s;caped from him with great
difficulty; and much more &s;uch &s;tuff, evi|dently the effect of a
di&s;tempered brain. Having, however, &s;hook off the phantom, he afterwards
ob|tained <PB N="242" REF="277"> tolerable repo&s;e, and felt him&s;elf pretty
well recovered when his friend, the Engli&s;h mu&s;ician, came to call him
up.</P>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e thus much, that the
reader might the better account for a di&s;tur|bance that happened at the inn.
The hou&s;e was buried in a total &s;ilence, when the Italian, who&s;e
di&s;temper had received no mitigation from either the journey or a &s;hower of
rain which had fallen in the afternoon, all of a &s;udden awoke from a horrid
dream, in which his inveterate enemy, the black, appeared to him on his
&s;teed, as before, but with the addition of a large &s;abre, with which he
threa|tened to put him in&s;tantly to death.</P>
<P>Frightened at the &s;pectre, like Chamont, he ro&s;e and called
for lights, which indeed he need not have done, for there was a &s;olitary
candle glimmering in the chimney corner, by the help of which imperfect
luminary, every thing could faintly be di&s;cerned. Leaping from the bed, the
fir&s;t object his eyes en|countered being a figure in the tape&s;try of Edward
the black prince, mounted upon a white hor&s;e, and giving directions at the
battle of Poictiers, he ran in a mo&s;t frantic manner along the gallery, and,
ow|ing to his corpulent form&mdash;which extremely re|&s;embled a brandy keg,
or a ninepin, made a rapid <PB N="243" REF="278"> de&s;cent to the hall
underneath. There, being in to|tal darkne&s;s, he groped about for a
con&s;iderable time, to no purpo&s;e, in hopes of finding a door into the
yard.</P>
<P>All this time the fever being at an alarming height, every thing
he touched &s;eemed to be the falling &s;troke of that mon&s;trous in&s;trument
of death wielded by the figure in the tape&s;try. At length, bellowing like a
bull, and bounding from one table to another, like a to&s;t pancake, or a
kicked football, he di&s;covered, as he imagined, the door. A faint glimmering
of light that beamed on him facilitated this welcome idea, and he &s;trove, but
in vain, to find the lock. Exploring this impervious gloom, which, as far as
his &s;cattered recollection gave op|portunity to notice, appeared the &s;eat
of &s;orcery, where all the demons of hell were a&s;&s;embled to tor|ment him;
for as to being in an inn, it never once occurred to his imagination,
&s;omething that felt like down, and &s;melt intolerably bitter, fell about his
ears, and tormented him the more in proportion as he attempted to defend
him&s;elf from it. And now, having his eyes, no&s;e and mouth pretty well
filled with this &s;uffocating annoyance, which, con|trary to the air-drawn
dagger of Macbeth, was &s;en|&s;ible only to the feeling, he &s;tampt, rubbed
his face, raved, &s;puttered, and &s;truggled, till at la&s;t he 
<PB N="244" REF="279"> got out of the vortex of this den of Erebus, to which he
&s;eemed to have been drawn by a helli&s;h and invi|&s;ible influence.</P>
<P>Lifting however his hands in an extreme of
di&s;|traction&mdash;indeed exactly as St. Paul is drawn preach|ing at
Athens&mdash;&s;omething tumbled from above which fitted him&s;elf completely,
like a coat of ar|mour, without the ca&s;que or cui&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Fully per&s;uaded the demon that pur&s;ued him had now got him
in his clutches, he &s;tormed, howled, foamed, and &s;queaked out as
incongruous and inar|ticulate a recitative as ever Hannibal or Scipio did at
the opera hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At this moment one of the waiters, who had been to pay a vi&s;it
to the bed chamber of the cook maid Molly, and who of cour&s;e was the mo&s;t
watchful in the hou&s;e, entered the hall with a lighted candle.</P>
<P>The Italian's &s;ingular jeopardy was occa&s;ioned by his
mi&s;taking the chimney for the door. There, &s;truggling to get out, he had
made him&s;elf as black as a &s;oot bag, and, upon his retreat, fairly
inve&s;ted him&s;elf in the &s;trange manner above mention, with a buff jerkin,
which my landlord had received as a legacy from his father, who affirmed and
verily <PB N="245" REF="280"> believed that it was the &s;ame worne by Guy,
Earl of Warwick, when he killed the dun cow.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the waiter &s;een this precious relique of his
ma&s;ter's ance&s;tors in the hands, or rather on the back of the Italian,
than, taking him for a thief, who wanted to rob the hou&s;e, he ran to fetch
his ma&s;ter. The Italian, to be even with him, upon de&s;crying the light and
an oppo&s;ite door at the &s;ame time, ran rapidly up another pair of &s;tairs.
His precipitate flight confirmed the waiter in his &s;u&s;|picions, and
facilitated his return to his ma&s;ter, who, by this time, alarmed by the
noi&s;e, had ju&s;t i&s;&s;ued from his apartment.</P>
<P>The landlord having heard the matter from his man, &s;wore by
the glory of his forefathers he would cut him up alive, and invoking the manes
of Ed|ward the black prince, and John of Gaunt, followed muttering cur&s;es all
the way to the chamber of the Engli&s;h mu&s;ician, whither the Italian had by
acci|dent directed his flight, and to where his di&s;tracted bellowing piloted
both man and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Italian had reached his brother
profe&s;&s;or's apartment, and hid him&s;elf, buff jerkin and all, under the
cloaths. The Engli&s;h|man, di&s;turbed by the noi&s;e, and &s;till more by the
<PB N="246" REF="281"> Italian's flouncing into bed, waked in an in&s;tant, and
before he had time to recollect what could oc|ca&s;ion &s;o extraordinary an
intru&s;ion, &s;aw in a con|fu&s;ed manner, by the help of the light which
dimly gleamed through the pa&s;&s;age, what a &s;trange hedi|ous figure he had
in bed with him, on which he had no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes, than, in a
dreadful fright, he all of a &s;udden leaped from the bed, and got under
it.</P>
<P>The Italian, who began to perceive the light, and concluding his
companion had &s;een the man and hor&s;e which he had no doubt &s;till
pur&s;ued him, followed him clo&s;e at his heels, being under the bed almo&s;t
as &s;oon as him. The Engli&s;h mu&s;ician being pre&s;&s;ed hard by the &s;ame
abominable figure, half dead with the fright, crawled out on the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide, which happened to be next to the door, &s;till followed by the
Italian.</P>
<P>The landlord and the waiter now came up with them, and the
candle being produced, the appear|ance of this quadrumvirate was beyond the
power of tongue or pen to de&s;cribe. The di&s;traction of the Italian, the
a&s;toni&s;hment of his companion, the pa|ralytic fear of the landlord, who,
&s;pight of the ex|amples of his ance&s;tors, trembled from head to foot, and
the con&s;ternation of the waiter, compo&s;ed in <PB N="247" REF="282"> their
different countenances &s;uch a &s;et of unbrage|ous, olive, livid and
cadaverous tints as &s;urely no faces ever before exhibited.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h trumpeter, as he encountered the landlord, was
overturned, and now lay flat on the floor. The de&s;cendant of Hengi&s;t had
gathered him&s;elf up into a grote&s;que attitude, looking at the fallen
mu&s;ician, and the waiter was pu&s;hing the candle forward, under his
ma&s;ter's arm, to &s;ee what was the matter, while the Italian had crept to
the other &s;ide of the bed, and having &s;earched for &s;omething to defend
him&s;elf, catched up his com|panion's trumpet, who had brought that
in&s;trument into his chamber, to have it &s;afe. With this wea|pon he leapt
upon a che&s;t of drawers, and whether he was now wrought to &s;uch a height of
phrenzy as not to know what he did, or whether in&s;tinct con|ducted the
trumpet to his mouth without his know|ledge, certain it is that his &s;tretched
companion had &s;carcely demanded what was the matter, and the landlord
thundered out a volley of execrations, ending with 
<Q REND="inline">'give me my jerkin,'</Q> than the Italian
&s;ounded a charge, and then a defiance, and then a parley, as fa&s;t as they
could &s;ucceed each other.</P>
<P>The moment the Engli&s;h mu&s;ician heard the trumpet, he knew
his friend as well as if he had <PB N="248" REF="283"> &s;poken to him, and
in&s;tantly gue&s;&s;ed that the con|fu&s;ion mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by
the Italian's ill|ne&s;s, who had become delirious, and thus alarmed the
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Feeling, however, for the &s;afety of his trumpet, which &s;ame
provident &s;en&s;ation impelled the land|lord in relation to the Earl of
Warwick's habili|ment, they both approached him, where he &s;tood, trumpet in
hand, like another fame in a buff jerkin, and were within an inch of their
prey, when the Italian fairly made a &s;pring over their heads, darted out of
the door, and ran along the gallery, then down &s;tairs, afterwards out of the
back door into the yard, and la&s;tly all over the village, blowing away
almo&s;t without any ce&s;&s;ation.</P>
<P>This was a partial la&s;t trump to the village, for all but
tho&s;e in their graves immediately &s;tarted up to &s;ee what was the matter.
As to the inn, imagi|nation never formed &s;o &s;ingular a confu&s;ion. The
mu&s;ician raved for his trumpet, the landlord &s;tormed for his buff jerkin;
here a waiter appeared with his cloaths tumbled into the tail of his &s;hirt,
which he held by way of an apron; there a maid &s;ervant with a petticoat tied
about her head in&s;tead of her wai&s;t; here John the o&s;tler appeared in
Sukey's night cap, and Sukey in John's wig:&mdash;In &s;hort there was not 
<PB N="249" REF="284"> one per&s;on in the hou&s;e&mdash;for all agreed to put
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> manly firmne&s;s, and meet in
the hall together&mdash;even to Sir Sidney and Lord Hazard, that did not cut a
ludicrous figure, while the village cried out &s;ome a fight, others a fire,
and all with ha&s;ty &s;teps ran towards our inn, which thus, in a few minutes,
was filled, in addition to its own company, with the major part of the village,
among whom were not a few females with clouts about their heads, and children
in their arms, a &s;ort of &s;pectators who are &s;ure to be foremo&s;t at
every &s;ight, be it a boxing match, a lord mayor's &s;hew, or an
execution.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mu&s;ician, getting upon the great table, now
begged to be heard; and having at la&s;t obtained &s;ilence, very naturally
accounted for every thing that had happened, fini&s;hing with a declara|tion
that he apprehended the Italian mu&s;t now be &s;o far gone, that the
landlord's jerkin and his trum|pet were certainly in danger of being
&s;poiled.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">'Far gone!' cried a country fellow, 'why I zeed
un myzel at the back of Ma&s;ter Clover's barn, and that's only behind thick
here orchard. Oons, do but li&s;t a tiny bit; do&s;t not hear un?'</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">'I do,' exclaimed the mu&s;ician, 'I do, and my
dear trum|pet is as &s;ound as ever! Zounds, I know what I will do: &s;hew me
to his bed chamber:'</Q>&mdash;at <PB N="250" REF="285" MS="y"> which he jumped
down, and &s;o &s;campered up &s;tairs, that the &s;pectators began to fear
le&s;t he &s;hould be infected with the &s;ame phrenzy as his companion. A very
few &s;econds however brought him back again, with the Italian's own trumpet,
hollowing out, 
<Q REND="inline">'This will do, this will do; here is that
&s;hall bring him back again.'</Q> He now ha&s;tened to the yard door, and,
putting the trumpet to his mouth, &s;ounded a defiance, which was immediately
an&s;wered at a di&s;tance. In his next e&s;&s;ay he was an&s;wered &s;omewhat
nearer. Upon two or three repetitions the Italian came down the &s;treet,
&s;ounding all the way a parley, till at la&s;t he was caught, held fa&s;t,
brought into the hou&s;e, and the trumpet and buff jerkin re&s;tored to their
re&s;pective owners. As to the poor devil him&s;elf, he was an object of the
true&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. His eyes darted fire, he foamed at the mouth, and
raved like a bedlamite.</P>
<P>At the de&s;ire of his friend, the Italian was con|veyed to his
bed, which, in a mo&s;t emaciated con|dition, he made &s;hift to leave in
&s;omewhat le&s;s than five weeks.</P>
