<P>THE medical reader will readily di&s;|cover part of the following <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> to be extracted from the works of the celebrated <HI>Hoffman,</HI> a name well known to the learned world.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations 'tis apprehended will be &s;upported by the authorities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hippocrates, Cel&s;us, Caelius Aurelianus, Lommius, Sydenham, Baglivi, Hoffman, Friend, Mead, Bacon, Boyle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to whom we have not con&s;tantly referred, in order to avoid prolixity, except where the nature of the &s;ubject ab&s;olutely require their own words; but the &s;entiments of the&s;e authors, will ea&s;ily be di&s;covered in the ab&s;tract, by tho&s;e acquainted with them.</NOTE> produced, the univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent of all the <HI>rationali&s;ts</HI> in phy&s;ic, and indeed we hope of every rational man.</P>
<P>A plain and per&s;picuous &s;tyle is what we have chiefly aimed at, in order to adapt the &s;ubject, to the comprehen&s;ion of every reader; and we can't help wi&s;hing this method more frequently pur&s;ued by phy&s;ical writers, that the medical &s;tudy might be rendered more en|tertaining and general: for we are thorough|ly &s;atisfyed, the art would be no &s;ufferer thereby, but the imputations it is charged with,
<PB REF="3">as an ob&s;ure, perplexing &s;tudy, by this means bani&s;hed, and it&s;elf receive new lu&s;tre, in proportion to its being more diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The many errors &s;o frequently committed in the admini&s;tring of <HI>No&s;trums, Univer&s;al Me|dicines,</HI> and particularly for &s;ome time pa&s;t, of <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>powder,</HI> induced us to point out to the <HI>favourers</HI> of &s;uch medicines, the inconve|niences and danger, they &s;ometimes expo&s;e them&s;elves too, by their imprudence, and cre|dulity; in attaching them&s;elves to <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>any other medicine,</HI> without proper re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>To guard therefore again&s;t &s;uch delu&s;ions, and to render the <HI>unphy&s;ical</HI> reader better qualified to decide, in an affair of &s;o much importance, as his own health, and life, is the purport of this <HI>E&s;&s;ay;</HI> where by demon|&s;trating the influence <HI>Nature</HI> has over many di&s;ea&s;es, he may the readier judge of medi|cal a&s;&s;i&s;tance in general, and on what plan, it can be&s;t be conducted.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE Power <HI>of</HI> NATURE <HI>and</HI> ART, IN Curing DISEASES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_NOTwith&s;tanding the indefa|tigable labours of &s;o many able men, for more than two thou&s;and years pa&s;t, to bring the art of phy&s;ick to a de|gree of perfection the other &s;ciences have attained; notwith&s;tanding the great pro|gre&s;s,
<PB N="2" REF="5">that has been made in many branches of this art; and how enlightened &s;oever we may have been by the improvements and di&s;coveries of the la&s;t century; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the cure of many di&s;|ea&s;es, is not yet arrived to a degree of perfection; or is <HI>infallibility</HI> ever like to be an attribute of phy&s;ick. To free a man from pain, and to &s;ave him from de&s;truc|tion, is in it&s;elf noble and god-like, nor is it to be wondered, that the fir&s;t phy&s;i|cians were deified, or that tho&s;e, who have excelled in this art &s;ince, have been highly e&s;teemed and honoured; for as in <HI>natural</HI> things, the <HI>&s;un</HI> is the author and fountain of life, &s;o the phy&s;ician who pre|&s;erves life, &s;eems a &s;econd origin there|of.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon's doctrine of the human body. Shaw's edit. Sect. 9. vol. 1.</NOTE> Yet happy would it be for mankind, if a more expeditious method of curing &s;ome <HI>fevers</HI> could be di&s;covered, con&s;i|&s;tent with the patients &s;afety? What emo|luments and applau&s;es would that man de&s;erve of his country, who&s;e &s;tudies had
<PB N="3" REF="6">been &s;o fortunate to di&s;cover a medicine, which had the power of checking the exorbitance of a <HI>fever,</HI> eluding its force, and entirely eradicating the latent cau&s;e? How happy, I &s;ay, if this could be effect|ed without waiting the tedious cour&s;e, <HI>nature</HI> is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to take, in fitting and preparing the <HI>febrile</HI> matter for a &s;eparation, and expul&s;ion from the blood, in order to a &s;alutary <HI>cri&s;is;</HI> or if even tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances <HI>art</HI> has hitherto employed, in accelerating the&s;e <HI>cri&s;es,</HI> or rendering them unnece&s;&s;ary, could be effected with le&s;s danger.</P>
<P>Such a pur&s;uit and &s;tudy is undoubt|edly laudable and beneficent, and tho' the whole &s;cience may be too ab&s;tru&s;e, and exten&s;ive, for the human mind to comprehend;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of all the things that <HI>nature</HI> hath created, the <HI>human body</HI> is mo&s;t capable of <HI>relief;</HI> tho' this <HI>relief</HI> be the mo&s;t liable to error. For as the &s;ub|tilty, and variety of the &s;ubject affords many oppor|tunities of <HI>cure;</HI> &s;o likewi&s;e great facility of <HI>mi&s;take.</HI> And therefore, as this <HI>art,</HI> e&s;pecially at pre&s;ent, &s;tands among the mo&s;t <HI>conjectural ones,</HI> &s;o the en|quiry into it, is to be placed among the mo&s;t &s;ub|tile and difficult.

<PB N="5" REF="8">we con&s;ider how few are qualified to judge properly, either of <HI>di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> or <HI>remedies;</HI> or to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>powers of art,</HI> and <HI>the influence of nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e</HI> are the chief points we &s;hall endeavour to render more obvious and familiar, for it is neither our de&s;ign, or intention, to enquire into the cau&s;es, which have retarded this wi&s;hed for perfection; or to point out the ob&s;tacles, which by <HI>&s;ome</HI> are thought to have impeded the completion of &s;o noble a <HI>fabrick,</HI> after &s;o fair a foundation laid by our <HI>predece&s;&s;ors</HI> of old: we &s;hall therefore fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that po&s;&s;ibly an invariable method of curing di&s;ea&s;es, can never be laid down, &s;o long as different temperaments of the air, climates, &s;ea&s;ons, and con&s;titutions, are &s;o frequently introducing new and various di&s;ea&s;es; which, tho' often in many re&s;|pects &s;imilar to others, which have pre|ceeded them, yet do they differ from them very e&s;&s;entially, and of cour&s;e require very different treatment. Without having re|cour&s;e to the authorities of &s;uch &s;agacious
<PB N="6" REF="9">writers, as Hippocrates, Sydenham, Boer|haave, Hoffman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who&s;e accurate and faithful ob&s;ervations would be indi&s;puta|ble in &s;uch a point; Who is there capa|ble of making proper remarks in practice, to whom this truth has not occurred? And who but from hence mu&s;t have been convinced, that in the direction of <HI>medicine,</HI> due attention mu&s;t be paid to <HI>particular &s;ymptoms,</HI> without being &s;lavi&s;hly attached to <HI>particular forms?</HI></P>
<P>But as the diligent ob&s;ervers<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hippocrates, de morb. vulg. Lib. vi. Sect. v. Cel&s;us lib. 3. ch. 1. Lommii com. de &s;anit. tuend.

<PB N="7" REF="10">by <HI>art;</HI> to point out when it is in her power to relieve <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> and when without the help of <HI>art,</HI> &s;he would de&s;troy her&s;elf; and this will naturally lead us to the true &s;tudy of the <HI>medical art.</HI></P>
<P>As the word <HI>nature</HI> is variou&s;ly defined, we de&s;ire to be under&s;tood by it, the laws of motion, originally implanted in the <HI>machine,</HI> in order to &s;et it in action, and pre&s;erve it &s;o; by this natural mechani&s;m of our bodies, whatever prove injurious to us is often thrown off &s;ome way, or other, provided the cour&s;e of <HI>nature</HI> be not in|terrupted. This power of <HI>nature</HI> is &s;o extraordinary in &s;ome con&s;titutions, that in &s;pite of all the blunders that are fre|quently committed, men recover even from the mo&s;t dangerous fevers.</P>
<P>That we may the better judge of the nature of a di&s;ea&s;e, or fever, it may by <HI>&s;ome</HI> perhaps be thought no u&s;ele&s;s digre&s;&s;i|on, to enquire wherein <HI>health</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, that by a proper definition of the term, we may the better under&s;tand, when it is perverted,
<PB N="8" REF="11">and by what means, either of <HI>nature,</HI> or <HI>art,</HI> it is again re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The <HI>health</HI> then of every animal body depends on a regular, moderate, and equa|ble circulation, of a proper condition'd blood, a due &s;ecretion, and execretion, of the <HI>juices</HI> or <HI>humours</HI> from it, and a proper degree of ela&s;ticity in the &s;olids. This cir|culation once di&s;turbed, and the&s;e &s;ecreti|ons once perverted, are the cau&s;e of almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es. Thus from ob&s;tructed per|&s;piration, or &s;weats &s;uddenly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the fluids that &s;hould freely flow off through the pores and glands of the skin, recoil on the blood, increa&s;e its quantity, and pervert its quality: a redundancy of bile, or an undue &s;ecretion of it in the liver, becomes productive of many and various di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as bilious cholics, jaundices, inflam|mations of the liver, St. Anthony's fire, fevers, and many other di&s;orders ari&s;ing from its acrimony and &s;timulus. From this &s;pecimen, we may judge of the ill effects, which are the con&s;equence of the re&s;t; for whenever the&s;e &s;ecretions are not
<PB N="9" REF="12">regularly carried on, the con&s;titution is &s;ure to be injured; and the&s;e <HI>humours</HI> or <HI>juices</HI> &s;o amicable before, by being now de|praved, are made capable of producing an infinity of di&s;orders.</P>
<P>We come now to explain, what we mean by <HI>nature</HI> curing di&s;ea&s;es, and how or by what ways &s;he effects this purpo&s;e and here among many others <HI>&s;he</HI> takes, to remove an offending enemy, brought on frequently by a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of one, or other, of the above <HI>&s;ecretions;</HI> if the cau&s;e be &s;light, <HI>&s;he</HI> frequently throws off the load of impure &s;erum, by the glands of the no&s;e and fauces, by coughs, a loo&s;e|ne&s;s, urine, and &s;weats; which if untimely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by <HI>art,</HI> are &s;ure to bring life in danger, or at lea&s;t foretell a future di&s;|ea&s;e. But her mo&s;t general method, when the di&s;ea&s;e is more important, is by rai&s;ing a <HI>fever</HI> for her relief, and increa&s;ing the motion of the circulating fluids;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hale's Haema&s;taticks, vol. ii. P. 101.</NOTE> by this means &s;he removes ob&s;tructions, which
<PB N="10" REF="13">threaten life; by this the &s;uperfluous, impure, and vi&s;cid fluids, which choak up the ve&s;&s;els, are attenuated, di&s;per&s;ed, and thrown off by urine, &s;tool, or per&s;piration: in other ca&s;es, when the ve&s;&s;els are too turgid, <HI>&s;he</HI> often relieves their di&s;tending fullne&s;s, by bur&s;ting open their mouths, and bringing on a &s;alutary bleeding, by tho&s;e of the <HI>na&s;e, uterus,</HI> and <HI>anus;</HI> and thus delivers <HI>ber&s;elf</HI> from the oppre&s;&s;ive load.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the ways &s;he takes to relieve her&s;elf in acute di&s;orders, as fevers: nor is &s;he &s;ometimes le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, in the cure of old, &s;tubborn, and chronical di&s;|ea&s;es; A&s;thma's of long &s;tanding have been cured by a St. Anthony's fire thrown out on the &s;urface; epilep&s;ies by &s;corbutic eruptions; and even melancholy and mad|ne&s;s by the piles. However it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the <HI>power of nature</HI> is not &s;o often manife&s;t in the cure of <HI>chronic,</HI> as <HI>acute</HI> di&s;orders, which latter are often effected &s;olely by her own means, as the former generally are by <HI>art.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<P>After having taken notice of the vari|ous ways <HI>nature</HI> takes to relieve her&s;elf, and ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t greivous di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ometimes happily terminated and cured, without <HI>medical</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance; few arguments can be thought nece&s;&s;ary to inforce this &s;tudy of <HI>nature</HI> and her laws, as preferable to any other; for if it is mo&s;t certain, that nature often prevails over art, which &s;hould always be her <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tant</HI> and <HI>imitator,</HI> we may ju&s;tly con|clude, that the method by which nature alone cures di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould be &s;tudied, as worthy our imitation, and more particular regard.</P>
<P>For whoever doth not attend to natures motions in relieving her, will mo&s;t cer|tainly do her great injury; which is fre|quently the ca&s;e with tho&s;e, who before the febrile matter is moveable and di&s;&s;olved, or prepared for &s;eparation, endeavour to ex|pel it untimely, and by ways neither adapt|ed to that purpo&s;e, or to which &s;he has any tendency her&s;elf. Thus as Hoffman ob|&s;erves
<PB N="12" REF="15">* it is to be lamented, that we every day &s;ee unskillful phy&s;icians, tru&s;ting too much to their NOSTRUMS, without having any regard to indications, method, or time, with re&s;pect to the di&s;ea&s;e, and thereby often bring the patient into extreme dan|ger; but if <HI>nature</HI> be powerful enough to elude the force of the medicine, and triumph over the di&s;ea&s;e, they then ar|rogantly boa&s;t of the importance of the cure, and gain both fame and rewards by their ra&s;hne&s;s; but &s;uch imprudent men are not to be tru&s;ted, for &s;ure it is not the lea&s;t part of the phy&s;icians art, to know the cour&s;e, genius, and &s;alutary ways of nature, that he may not di&s;turb her operations, or a&s;&s;i&s;t her improperly.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this power of na|ture in curing di&s;ea&s;es, 'tis evident there are many, where &s;he wants a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and would often de&s;troy her&s;elf without timely relief, by the very means &s;he endeavours for her pre&s;ervation; the &s;ymptoms brought<NOTE PLACE="foot">F. Hoffman, opera omnia phi&s;ico medica fol. de natura &amp; art. officac. vol. vi. p. 261.</NOTE>
<PB N="13" REF="16">on by her own efforts, being often more dangerous than the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf; &s;o that in many di&s;ea&s;es, a great part of the phy&s;icians work, is to appea&s;e her fury, and correct her errors; for being &s;ometimes tran&s;ported as it were, with a blind and impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he un&s;ea&s;onable produces tho&s;e dangerous, di&s;orders in the body, that demand the &s;uccour of art. Thus to what &s;alutary purpo&s;e are tho&s;e violent &s;pa&s;ms which ari&s;e from &s;ome poi&s;ons taken inter|nally, but to retain the enemy, &s;he wants to expell? Of what u&s;e to her, are tho&s;e various convul&s;ions, which ari&s;e from fla|tulencies and worms in the bowels? To what purpo&s;e tho&s;e direful pains, tho&s;e vehement, and acute fevers, which ari&s;e from the &s;lighte&s;t injury, or puncture of nerve, or tendon? Certainly the&s;e enor|mous commotions are wor&s;e than the cau&s;e, for who&s;e &s;ake according the Hel|montians, they were by provident nature appointed for her relief; for unle&s;s art &s;oon runs to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they will mo&s;t inevitably bring her into great danger, if not de&s;troy her. What &s;uccour can nature
<PB N="14" REF="17">bring to fixed inflammations of the head, lungs, uterus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without the help of art. The venereal lues was never cured by nature. The dry and bilious cholic, with &s;ome others, require the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of art: inveterate &s;chrophulous, &s;cor|butic, and leprous di&s;orders, nature never removed. The gout, epilep&s;y, madne&s;s, drop&s;ies, gravel and &s;tone, worms, and many other di&s;orders that might be enu|merated, tho' all of them are &s;trong proofs of the little power nature has over them, yet many of them are known to be cured by the efficacy of medicine, and all of them have been alleviated thereby. In &s;hort with Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Free inquiry into the vulgar notion of nature Shaw's edit. p. 143.</NOTE> we may look on a good phy|&s;ician, not properly as a &s;ervant to nature, but a coun&s;ellor, and a friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tant; who in his patients body furthers tho&s;e motions, and other things, that he judges conducive to the welfare and recovery of it; but as to tho&s;e he perceives likely to be hurtful, either by encrea&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="15" REF="18">or otherwi&s;e endangering the patient, he thinks it is his part to oppo&s;e or hinder, tho' nature manife&s;tly &s;eems to endeavour to increa&s;e, or carry on tho&s;e hurtful mo|tions. Thus many of the mi&s;eries, to which human nature is &s;ubject, may be relieved by proper a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and with A&s;clepiades we may &s;ay, <HI>naturam et prode&s;&s;e &amp; nocere.</HI></P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, that tho' <HI>art</HI> is chiefly in&s;trumental in the cure of chronical di&s;ea&s;es, yet it is under the au&s;pices of <HI>nature,</HI> and effected by a proper imitation of her ways.

Thus as a certain degree of <HI>fever</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="19">is nece&s;&s;ary to remove acute, &s;o al&s;o chroni|cal di&s;orders; and as a late writer has ob|&s;erved, could a phy&s;ician certainly rai&s;e a <HI>fever,</HI> and keep it to what height he plea&s;ed, many chronic di&s;orders might be thus cured; but tho' this cannot be effected by art, yet nature may be imitated by direct|ing the above medicines, which by ex|perience have been found &s;ucce&s;sful for this purpo&s;e, &s;o that in many ca&s;es, it may be &s;aid, the <HI>fever</HI> is not the <HI>di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>remedy, et dolor, e&s;t medicina doloris.</HI></P>
<P>From hence then we learn, that though <HI>nature</HI> often cures di&s;ea&s;es, yet &s;he often &s;tands in need of medical help; tho' it is more evidently ob&s;erved in <HI>chronic,</HI> than <HI>acute</HI> ca&s;es; for we &s;peak not of tho&s;e which come under the &s;urgeon's cogni&s;ance, where &s;he mu&s;t often be de&s;troyed, with|out immediate manual a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nor is it the lea&s;t part of the phy&s;icians &s;kill to know when to give it, and to di|&s;tingu&s;h between the force of nature and art, between the effects and bounds of me|dicine.

<P>Thus is it plain that practice <HI>alone</HI> will not teach a man the art;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barker's e&s;&s;ay on the <HI>agreement</HI> between an|tient and modern phy&s;icians, p. 73.</NOTE> for there are not wanting in&s;tances of practitioners, who are grown old in bu&s;ine&s;s, but for want of being early in&s;tructed in the principles of the art, are almo&s;t as ab&s;olute &s;trangers to it, as they were at fir&s;t &s;etting out.

Such is the fluctuating &s;tate of the mind, unle&s;s a man is thoroughly grounded in the rudiments of his art; for like one perplexed in a labyrinth, unle&s;s the right path is
<PB N="21" REF="24">pur&s;ued, he is continually erring and mi&s;|taking his way; treading again and again in the &s;ame tract, till he is tired; yet is he often deceived in the mazey round, and frequently flatters him&s;elf, with the pur&s;uit of the true path.</P>
<P>This naturally leads us to enquire into the force, and power, of &s;ome favourite medicines, which are given in <HI>acute fevers;</HI> and are &s;uppo&s;ed now and then, to work &s;uch &s;peedy recoveries; when the cure in general, rather depends upon a <HI>due</HI> regula|tion in diet, and proper regimen in other re&s;pects, than any <HI>peculiar medicine:</HI> but our fondne&s;s to &s;uch remedies, generally ri&s;es in proportion to our <HI>credulity, igno|rance,</HI> or <HI>prejudices;</HI> for rather than attri|bute any good change in the di&s;temper, to the power of &s;uch regimen; it flatters the vanity of &s;ome, to a&s;cribe it to a medicine of his own pre&s;cribing, tho' ever &s;o insig|nificant. How often have the mo&s;t &s;imple things, luckily timed at the cri&s;is of a fever, been applauded for effects, they had no preten&s;ions to; for nature who often
<PB N="22" REF="25">triumphs over &s;light ob&s;tacles, little cares to whom the honour is attributed, &s;o that &s;he her&s;elf comes off victorious. This might be abundantly exemplified in a great variety of in&s;tances, to the conviction of the mo&s;t &s;anguine bigot: and indeed im|partial, and competent judges, will readily confe&s;s, that nothing is more difficult to a&s;certain, than the <HI>true virtue</HI> of medicines: for their effects in general rather take their force, from the judgment of the phy&s;ician, in their ju&s;t application, than from any con&s;tant and inherent virtue of their own. The learned Dr. <HI>Friend</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Friend Emmenologia, de remediorum viribus.</NOTE> hath curiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, and &s;hewn, that the different operation of remedies, ari&s;es not from any change of virtue in the medicament, which continues always the &s;ame; but from the different &s;tate of the body, wherein it is applied.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>bark</HI> taken in the fever fit, &s;hall often purge, between it, bind; <HI>Opium</HI> in&s;tead of controuling watchings, &s;hall fre|quently
<PB N="23" REF="26">increa&s;e them; <HI>Aloes</HI> who&s;e pro|perty is to purge, &s;hall in &s;ome ca&s;es, tho' given for that purpo&s;e, not operate at all; while re&s;tringents, &s;hall in other con|&s;titutions occa&s;ion purging. <HI>Steel, Antimony, Mercury,</HI> &amp;c. might be brought to eluci|date this truth; and prove their different effects on different con&s;titutions; as well as when they are injudiciou&s;ly directed.</P>
<P>But as it may be nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;et this affair in a clearer light, to prevent being mi&s;under&s;tood; and to &s;hew, when <HI>nature</HI> can do without <HI>art,</HI> and where the latter is requi&s;ite; I mu&s;t beg leave to explain my&s;elf a little farther, on both the&s;e heads. Who then, ever &s;o &s;lightly acquaint|ed with acute di&s;orders, but mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved, that fevers in their infancy, are frequently and ea&s;ily removed, by very &s;imple means; or rather that the FEVER, which is nature's in&s;trument, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by di|lution with &s;mall liquors, and ab&s;tinence from animal diet, &s;eldom wants any other helps; but where bleeding and gentle eva|cuations are joined to the&s;e, the end is gene|rally accompli&s;hed in a few days; for by
<PB N="24" REF="27">this; method, the fluids are diluted, the &s;e|cretions renewed, and the fullne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els abated: and to &s;peak ingenuou&s;ly, 'tis extremely probable, that fa&s;ting, and ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s, would cure many, and prevent mo&s;t di&s;tempers; had men re&s;olu|tion enough to pur&s;ue it for a &s;ufficient length of time, under proper regulations.</P>
<P>But when this method has been neglect|ed, and repeated colds, or acts of intempe|rance, are urged on one another; aggrava|ted by a <HI>heating</HI> regimen, or <HI>hotter</HI> medi|cines; we mu&s;t not wonder at the difficul|ties that often attend the removal of <HI>&s;uch a fever;</HI> for the blood and other juices, are <HI>now</HI> become too vi&s;cid or &s;izey, to circu|late in the finer ve&s;&s;els; hence frequently from &s;uch ob&s;tructions, ari&s;e inflammati|ons in particular parts; which if not &s;oon removed by <HI>art,</HI> terminate in matter, or fatal gangrenes. In other <HI>fevers,</HI> the blood is in the rever&s;e &s;tate, being too rare, thin, and acrimonious; tending to di&s;&s;olution, and putrefaction; which by the rapidity of the circulation, is frequently forced thro'
<PB N="25" REF="28">the extremities of the &s;mall arteries, and are the cau&s;e of malignant eruptions, and violent bleedings. Here indeed it is high time for <HI>art</HI> to interpo&s;e, for <HI>nature</HI> is no longer her own a&s;&s;i&s;tant, but will &s;oon de|&s;troy her&s;elf, without timely &s;uccour: under the&s;e different circum&s;tances, the skillful phy&s;ician has &s;ufficient opportuni|ties, of di&s;tingui&s;hing his prudence, and abilities, for the &s;torm is now rai&s;ed, the pungent pains are become in&s;upportable; the di&s;turbed functions of the mind, call aloud to be be-calm'd, that rea&s;on may re|a&s;&s;ume her throne; now is the time to a&s;&s;i&s;t her effectually, either by curbing her inordinate tran&s;ports, or &s;uccouring her langui&s;hing &s;truggles: Here the cautious pre&s;criber, will guard well again&s;t either extream, lea&s;t by an injudi cious applica|tion, he may aggravate the cau&s;e, by adding fuel to a fire which burns but too inten&s;ily already, or check that <HI>vital flame,</HI> that is but too nigh extingui&s;hed. Here <HI>he</HI> who has carefully &s;tudied the laws of <HI>nature</HI> and ob&s;erved the ways <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;ometimes takes to relieve her&s;elf, will be be&s;t able, to give
<PB N="26" REF="29">her that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he now &s;o much wants; while <HI>he,</HI> who is only acquainted with her in <HI>&s;peculation,</HI> will &s;tand amazed, and affrighted at &s;ymptoms he never &s;u&s;pected, and impotently attack the di&s;ea&s;e, on the &s;trength of &s;ome favourite <HI>hypothe&s;is,</HI> or &s;ome darling NOSTRUM.</P>
<P>From this portrait, or de&s;cription of two different kinds of fevers only, one may rea|&s;onable inquire how far any one method, or <HI>medicine,</HI> is like to an&s;wer both inten|tions; but before we venture to mention our own thoughts on this head, let us take the opinion of the immortal <HI>Sydenham,</HI> that candid, and judicious ob&s;erver; who &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swan's Sydenham, p. 293.</NOTE> there are various kinds of fevers, mo&s;t of which require their <HI>peculiar method</HI> of cure, different from the re&s;t; and that the &s;ame individual fever, of whatever kind it be, requires one treatment at the fir&s;t, and another &s;omewhat different, through all its &s;tages, as long as it continues. Many other &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages might be extracted
<PB N="27" REF="30">from this great man's works. Let us hear al&s;o the experienced <HI>Baglivi,</HI> who &s;ays,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Baglivi's practice of phy&s;ick, p. 271.</NOTE> a great many have &s;uch an affection to &s;ome one remedy, that they think it alone in|titled to a &s;overeign virtue, and power, of curing almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es; either by rea&s;on of a lucky event, ob&s;erved now and then to en&s;ue the u&s;e of it, or rather by a certain innate propen&s;ity that they have, not only of crying up &s;ome medicines, but a&s;cribing to them <HI>fictitious</HI> virtues: but I mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the bye, &s;ays he, that no phy&s;ician can cure a fever happily, with|out he informs him&s;elf of the febrile &s;tate of the blood; whether it is too rapid, thin, or inflammable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or on the other hand, apt to congeal, thick, malignant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For in &s;uch different &s;tates of the blood, the indications of cure mu&s;t be diver&s;ifyed accordingly. The honourable Mr. BOYLE in his treati&s;e on the u&s;efull|ne&s;s of philo&s;ophy, ob&s;erves, that it is much more difficult, than men can imagine, to make an accurate experiment in phy&s;ic,
<PB N="28" REF="31">for often the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e proceeding, in &s;everal per&s;ons, from quite different cau&s;es, will be increa&s;ed in one, by the &s;ame re|medy, which has cured it in an other and not only the <HI>con&s;titutions</HI> of patients, may as much alter the <HI>effects</HI> as the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of di&s;ea&s;es; but even in the &s;ame patient, and in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ingle circum|&s;tance of time, may have almo&s;t as great an operation upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the medi|cine, as either of the two former particu|lars. The learned FRIEND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's edit. vol. 1. p. 176.</NOTE> on this occa|&s;ion al&s;o ob&s;erves, that a man who has the lea&s;t acquaintance with phy&s;ic, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that a univer&s;al medicine mu&s;t be a <HI>cheat;</HI> and though it be ever &s;o good and valuable a medicine it&s;elf, yet it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible it can be equally appli|cable to all per&s;ons, in all ca&s;es, and at all junctures; and therefore it mu&s;t be de|termined by the skill of &s;ome di&s;cerning phy&s;ician, who is well appri&s;ed of the na|ture and &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, where<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of phy&s;ick, vol. 1. p. 78.</NOTE>

I am obliged &s;ays
<PB N="30" REF="33">he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James's di&s;&s;ertation on fevers, p. 40.</NOTE> to own, that as I e&s;teemed life too &s;acred to be hazarded, for the &s;ake of an experiment, I have <HI>never</HI> neglected to call in <HI>all other medicinal aids,</HI> to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when I thought the ca&s;e required them, and believed that they would be of &s;ervice. Again<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 46.</NOTE> as I would be extreamly cautious of leading any one into error, in an affair of &s;o much importance, as is that of life, I mu&s;t remark, that when violent inflam|mations of the vital parts threaten imme|diate de&s;truction, I &s;hould think it impru|dent to neglect repeated bleedings, purges, cly&s;ters, and <HI>all other a&s;&s;i&s;tances,</HI> which the art of medicine can afford.</P>
<P>After &s;uch plain and candid conce&s;&s;ions, one would think it was impo&s;&s;ible, that any but &s;tupid bigots, or &s;uper&s;titious old women, unacquainted with &s;uch auxilia|ries, would &s;olely depend upon this reme|dy, and in the mo&s;t de&s;perate ca&s;es.

<P>How ab&s;urd then mu&s;t it appear to every <HI>impartial</HI> man, who reflects cooly, that a medicine, which it is acknowledged may demand all the&s;e <HI>occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tances,</HI> &s;hould without re&s;trictions, be thus <HI>ra&s;hly</HI> and <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> recommended <HI>by &s;ome</HI> in all fevers; for whatever limitations may be hinted at in the treati&s;e, can it be &s;up|po&s;ed, that tho&s;e unacquainted with the

Neither can Dr. <HI>James,</HI> always be at hand to, direct them, and who le&s;s acquainted with that medicine, would risk their reputations, by being concerned with it, on &s;uch important occa&s;ions, where lives are at &s;take; much le&s;s can it be po&s;&s;ible, that the promi&s;cuous admini|&s;tration of this remedy, to di&s;ea&s;es of &s;uch <HI>general Names,</HI> as are mentioned in the <HI>adverti&s;ement,</HI> can be &s;ucce&s;sful; when the conditions of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, do &s;o perpetu|ally vary.</P>
<P>But if the operation, and effects of this medicine are to be <HI>rationally,</HI> and not <HI>empi|rically</HI> accounted for; if it is to be ex|amined by the &s;ame te&s;ts, that all others are; we &s;hall find, that like them, it mu&s;t be directed, and given with prudence, and skill, to render it efficacious, and prevent it's being injurious. For example if it has been found &s;ucce&s;sful in thinning and at|tenuating the <HI>vi&s;cid, &s;izy</HI> blood and fluids, is it not likely to be prejudicial in ca&s;es,
<PB N="33" REF="36">where the fluids are already too <HI>thin</HI> and <HI>rare?</HI> If it has been found u&s;eful, in in|crea&s;ing the &s;ecretions of the glands of the &s;kin, inte&s;tines, and kidneys, by pro|moting &s;tools, urine, and &s;weats, may it not be injurious, in tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the&s;e &s;ecretions are but too <HI>liberal</HI> already?

<PB N="41" REF="44">in proportion to the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e: That <HI>no one medicine,</HI> can ever an&s;wer &s;o many different purpo&s;es; more e&s;peci|ally one who&s;e <HI>operations</HI> are &s;o <HI>precarious;</HI> and which we are convinced from the pro|ce&s;s of, (which is no &s;ecret to the world) that tho' it may be u&s;eful in &s;ome ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be prejudicial in others; that a pro|mi&s;cuous, unlimited power of giving it, <HI>according to &s;ome,</HI> has to our knowledge, been productive of many, and great mi&s;|carriages: How often has nature been di|&s;turbed, and a favourable cri&s;is prevented by this, and other ill-timed medicines? And how ea&s;ily di&s;tempers &s;light in them&s;elves, are often converted into important ones, by <HI>untimely</HI> and <HI>injudicious</HI> applica|tions, is well known to the careful ob&s;erver. Ca&s;es of this kind have occured where <HI>nature</HI> tho' feeble, and oppre&s;&s;ed, yet labour|ing hard to relieve her&s;elf, and depurate the blood by critical &s;wellings, has been mo&s;t prepo&s;terou&s;ly teized and thwarted with the &s;tools, and &s;weats, incited by this medicine, till &s;he had nigh &s;unk under the

<P>I cannot conclude without taking notice, of a ridiculous in&s;inuation, advanced <HI>by &s;ome,</HI> as a rea&s;on, why the gentlemen of the faculty do not patronize this medicine; which is, that it would be de&s;tructive of their private intere&s;ts, by making &s;uch &s;peedy cures. But this objection, the trite, and &s;tale artifice of every empirick to re|commend his NOSTRUM, is as mean, and contemptible, as it is fal&s;e; 'tis an artful lure, thrown out only as a decoy for the publick, that they may the more readily become their dupes.</P>
<P>For are not the phy&s;icians of this nation in general, and of <HI>London</HI> in particular, men of liberal educations, who&s;e learning, and abilities are equal to any in <HI>Europe?</HI> Are not many of them, as con&s;picuous for their humanity, benevolence, and tender|ne&s;s, as they are for their independant fortunes?

Is it not notorious, that many of them in their private practice, as well as by repeated trials in our <HI>ho&s;pi|tals,</HI> have found it was by no means to be relied on? or can it de&s;erve credit from any &s;en&s;ible, and unprejudiced minds, that tho&s;e few practitioners <HI>who do</HI> e&s;pou&s;e this medicine, have <HI>alone</HI> monopolized the amiable qualities of truth, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and common hone&s;ty?

<P>The&s;e are <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the ob&s;ervations, that have occured, and 'tis to be apprehended will have &s;ome weight with the impartial: for if neither <HI>honour, con&s;cience, humanity,</HI> and <HI>independance,</HI> can be thought to have any influence over the conduct, of &s;uch pro|fe&s;&s;ors of phy&s;ic; we mu&s;t be under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of condemning, a body of men, as mon&s;ters in nature, who have hitherto been e&s;teemed <HI>real ornaments</HI> to their country, and <HI>re&s;pectable,</HI> as well as <HI>u&s;eful</HI> members of &s;ociety.</P>

<P N="38">38. Mr. <HI>D.</HI> had a copious &s;weat, for four|teen hours; and three &s;tools.</P>
<P>Thus we may ob&s;erve, that in eight ca&s;es, <HI>the powder</HI> both <HI>vomited, purged,</HI> and <HI>&s;weat;</HI> and the&s;e generally <HI>profu&s;e</HI> &s;weats;
<PB N="50" REF="53"><HI>pretty &s;mart, con&s;iderable, and frequent</HI> purg|ings, and vomiting <HI>&s;everal times.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;even ca&s;es, it operated by <HI>&s;weats,</HI> and <HI>purging;</HI> &s;ometimes moderately, but in general <HI>profu&s;ely,</HI> and <HI>con&s;iderably</HI> both ways.</P>
<P>In three, it <HI>vomited</HI> and <HI>&s;weated;</HI> and in three more, it <HI>&s;weat only.</HI> Three al&s;o it <HI>vomited</HI> and <HI>purged,</HI> in one moderately, in the others, it vomited three or four times, and purged <HI>&s;everal;</HI> in one ca&s;e it purged only, and in two had no operation at all.</P>
<P>So that out of twenty &s;even ca&s;es, it operated by &s;tool in nineteen, and in ten of them <HI>&s;martly,</HI> and <HI>con&s;iderably.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the general effects and opera|tions which followed the taking <HI>this medi|cine,</HI> with &s;ometimes a copious &s;ediment in the urine; and may we not from hence fairly conclude, that in tho&s;e ca&s;es, where <HI>vomiting, purging,</HI> and <HI>&s;weating</HI> are per|nicious, (and many &s;uch there are) that the u&s;e of <HI>this powder</HI> &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended? When the con&s;titution al&s;o is lowered, or
<PB N="51" REF="54">greatly reduced by the di&s;ea&s;e, may not the evacuations above mentioned, e&s;pecially when <HI>profu&s;e, &s;mart,</HI> and <HI>frequent,</HI> in many ca&s;es, precipitate the patient's fate? But if the indication be to <HI>&s;weat, purge,</HI> or <HI>vomit</HI> &s;ingly, can we ever be &s;ure of an&s;wering any one of the&s;e intentions alone, without pro|moting others, we do not want, and which may prove of dangerous con&s;equence? Such &s;eems to be the uncertainty of this medicine.</P>
<P>When given in &s;mall quantities, it po&s;&s;ibly may be le&s;s hazardous, though perhaps le&s;s efficacious, as &s;ome <HI>operation</HI> &s;eems always expected from it. But as Dr. <HI>James</HI> has not yet thought proper, to furni&s;h us with ca&s;es of this &s;ort, we &s;hall for the pre&s;ent decline any further animadver&s;ions: nor in|deed &s;hould we have troubled the public with the&s;e, had we not thought they were become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, both for the reputation of <HI>the medicine,</HI> as well as for the <HI>patient's</HI> &s;afety.</P>
