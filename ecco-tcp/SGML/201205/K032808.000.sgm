<HEAD>A REPLY TO Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s Short Account of <HI>Midwifery,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_MR. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> his &s;hort Account of the State of <HI>Midwifery</HI> in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> in which he has endeavoured to ca&s;t a Cloud of Reproach over the Characters of tho&s;e that practi&s;e this noble and nece&s;&s;ary Branch of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> but particularly my own, need not have remain|ed &s;o long unan&s;wered, could I have per|&s;waded my&s;elf it had de&s;erved it.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P><HI>Malicious</HI> Productions are generally be&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed; but le&s;t <HI>Silence</HI> &s;hould be look'd upon as an Argument of Guilt, as in the&s;e Ca&s;es by the Weak it &s;ometimes is, and Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> &s;hould be encourag'd to deal farther in <HI>Calumny</HI> and <HI>A&s;per&s;ion,</HI> I am at length induced to give him a Reply, which I &s;hall at once enter upon, without farther Preface or Preamble.</P>
<P>To begin then with his <HI>Dedication:</HI> The only Motives of Dedications &s;eem to be, either to &s;ubmit one's Performance to a proper <HI>Judge,</HI> to make &s;ome &s;mall re|turn of <HI>Gratitude</HI> for Benefits receiv'd; or el&s;e to <HI>curry Favour.</HI> Now, as the Ho|nourable and worthy Lady, to whom Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has dedicated his Book, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>Judge</HI> of its Merit; and, in all probability, never con|ferr'd the lea&s;t <HI>Favour</HI> upon the <HI>Author,</HI> the <HI>Reader</HI> cannot well be mi&s;taken in con|jecturing what was Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s <HI>true Drift</HI> in his <HI>Dedication.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Quibble, how a Man can be a Wife, without being an Hermaphrodite?</HI> Whether a <HI>Maid</HI> may not be taught the Art of delivering Women, and yet be no <HI>Wife?</HI> That <HI>Widows</HI> lay Women, and yet are not <HI>Wifes,</HI> and his Query about <HI>Girl-Midwifes,</HI> are too low and trifling to de&s;erve
<PB N="5" REF="4">a &s;erious An&s;wer, and &s;eem rather to be the product of a pert <HI>Sufficiency,</HI> than a &s;ound <HI>Judgment.</HI> They are rather Indica|tions of one who was willing to cut him|&s;elf out Work for critici&s;ing at all Events, than of a cool and &s;ober Rea&s;oner.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to his, I &s;hall beg leave to put the following <HI>Queries.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If the Term <HI>Midwifery</HI> is properly ap|plied to the Practice of that Art, when in the Hands of either Sex, why may not either Man or Woman &s;o practi|&s;ing, be in Propriety of Speech call'd a <HI>Midwife?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Is not the Word <HI>Midwifery</HI> rather ex|pre&s;&s;ive of Practice on a <HI>Wife,</HI> who on|ly is pre&s;um'd to want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Man or Woman in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, than of the <HI>Sex</HI> of the Per&s;on practi&s;ing?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. On receding from the common Form and Cu&s;tom of Speech in this Ca&s;e, is not the &s;uppo&s;ed Ab&s;urdity exchang'd for <HI>Unintelligibility?</HI> That is, what Idea can be fix'd to, what Etymology found for the new Term <HI>Midman</HI> and <HI>Mid|woman?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Word <HI>Midman,</HI> he owns him&s;elf, is not an over-neat Expre&s;&s;ion, and it cer|tainly
<PB N="6" REF="5">carries (to u&s;e his own Words) <HI>more Non&s;en&s;e in the very Front of it,</HI> than the Term he has endeavoured to explode. <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> or <HI>U&s;e</HI> hath always the Effect of a <HI>Law;</HI></P>
<Q><P>Quem penes arbitrium e&s;t &amp; jus &amp; norma loquendi.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Hor.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>And what is <HI>Language</HI> but a <HI>cu&s;tomary</HI> and receiv'd u&s;e of Words? So that we may &s;ee the Term <HI>Man-Midwife</HI> may be de|fended, both from <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> and <HI>Propriety,</HI> and will doubtle&s;s be in u&s;e long after Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> him&s;elf &s;hall be forgotten.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 3. Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> falls very foul on the Character of the celebrated Dr. <HI>Chamberlen,</HI> repre&s;enting him as <HI>puzzling</HI> and <HI>confounding</HI> the Art he profe&s;s'd, to the Advantage of mo&s;t of the greate&s;t Families in this Kingdom, rather than <HI>im|proving</HI> it; and very indecently, and un|ju&s;tly too, brands him as an <HI>artful</HI> and <HI>in&s;inuating</HI> Tran&s;lator. He &s;ays, he rather <HI>darkens,</HI> than <HI>explains</HI> his Author's (<HI>Mau|riceau</HI>'s) Meaning; and confidently affirms, <HI>all the additional Knowledge he was the Author of,</HI> to be only to tell the World, that <HI>He,</HI> and his <HI>Family,</HI> can a&s;&s;i&s;t Women in Labour better than any body el&s;e, and gives him the mean <HI>Epithet</HI> of a <HI>No&s;trum|monger.</HI> (<HI>Page</HI> 4.) He pronounces every thing with an <HI>ip&s;e dixit,</HI> like a &s;econd <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and &s;ets him&s;elf up at once,
<PB N="7" REF="6">both for <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Jury.</HI> The late learn|ed Dr. <HI>Friend,</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to Dr. <HI>Mead, about Purging in the Small Pox,</HI> gives Dr. <HI>Chamberlen</HI> a very different Character from Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> &s;peaking of him as one <HI>mo&s;t &s;kilful in the Art he profe&s;s'd;</HI> (<HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 5.) Whence we may plainly &s;ee, how different the Character of the &s;ame Per&s;on is, when drawn by <HI>real</HI> and <HI>pretended</HI> Judges.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 5. He taxes him with perverting Mr. <HI>Mauriceau</HI>'s De&s;ign by his Tran&s;lation, and having his own Litere&s;t at heart more than that of the <HI>Midwomen,</HI> as he ridicu|lou&s;ly terms them.</P>
<P>He accu&s;es him of <HI>coaxing</HI> the Mid|women, and yet in the &s;ame Sentence <HI>coaxes</HI> them him&s;elf, and pays a ful&s;ome Compliment to the Qualifications of the <HI>Town Midwomen</HI> above tho&s;e in the <HI>Coun|try. P.</HI> 5. The <HI>Town Midwomen</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly (&s;ome of them) become his <HI>Pupils,</HI> when he gives his intended <HI>Lectures,</HI> and &s;o ought in Prudence to be well &s;poken of. But tho&s;e in the Country being too remote for this extraordinary Advantage, will, for aught I can &s;ee, in his Opinion, &s;till labour under the Imputation of being <HI>unqualified</HI> ('till his Scheme for having <HI>Mid|men</HI> to in&s;truct the <HI>Midwomen</HI> in Country places can take Effect) unle&s;s their Affairs can permit them to take a Journey to <HI>Lad
<PB N="8" REF="7">Lane,</HI> where, it &s;eems, the only Per&s;on pro|per to in&s;truct them is to be met with.</P>
<P>Upon Dr. <HI>Chamberlen's</HI> &s;aying, <Q>"that in Countries and Places where Advice is not &s;ea&s;onably to be had, Midwifes are compelled to do their be&s;t, <HI>as God &s;hall enable</HI> them (P. 5.)"</Q> which is a common Expre&s;&s;ion for a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of their Duty, according to the be&s;t of their Abilities. Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> takes occa&s;ion here, to cut a very indecent <HI>Joke</HI> upon the <HI>Deity,</HI> by a&s;king, <HI>if God has any where promi&s;ed to give any more A&s;&s;i&s;tance to a Country, than a Town Midwoman?</HI> In the next place, he &s;ub&s;titutes <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Doctor</HI> acting as <HI>two equal</HI> Beings; and then, to prove that the Divine God|head will reward us with the Knowledge of any u&s;eful Art, in Proportion to our own hone&s;t Diligence and A&s;&s;iduity, which in holy Writ he has a&s;&s;ured us he will; or, which is the &s;ame thing, to prove a point of <HI>Revelation,</HI> he quotes a Pa&s;&s;age from a <HI>Heathen Poet; Dii laborantibus om|nia vendunt:</HI> thereby making mention of <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Gods in the plural Number, for what the true and one God only can perform. <HI>Ri&s;um teneatis?</HI> Upon Dr. <HI>Chamberlen</HI>'s advi&s;ing the good Women not to blame tho&s;e who are not backward in dangerous Ca&s;es, to de&s;ire Advice, le&s;t it co&s;t them <HI>dear;</HI> he indecently a&s;ks: <HI>If it does not
<PB N="9" REF="8">always co&s;t them dear when they do?</HI> Al|luding, I pre&s;ume, to the Gratifications u|&s;ually given in &s;uch Ca&s;es; notwith&s;tanding he advances, a little farther, that a SUR|GEON ought to be well &s;atisfied for any Improvement in, or Invention relating to, a manual Operation, <HI>P.</HI> 20. Is not <HI>De|livery,</HI> wherever the Help of either Man or Woman is required, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e a <HI>manual</HI> Operation? And if &s;o, why mu&s;t not a <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> be rewarded for his Trou|ble, as well as a <HI>Surgeon.</HI> But <HI>Self,</HI> like Oil, will be always uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Page (the 7th.) the Plot of Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s whole Performance begins to open, when he &s;ays, that the <HI>Midwomen's</HI> want of Knowledge is more their <HI>Misfortune</HI> than their <HI>Fault,</HI> becau&s;e they have not yet had &s;uch proper Opportunities of informing them&s;elves as they ought to have. But now it mu&s;t hereafter be their <HI>Fault</HI> more than their <HI>Misfortune,</HI> if they are not bet|ter qualify'd, after knowing where the Source of all Knowledge in <HI>Midwifery</HI> is to be found. This is the fir&s;t <HI>Act</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dou|gla&s;s</HI>'s <HI>Farce;</HI> and in the &s;ucceeding ones the <HI>Plot</HI> will unravel it&s;elf more and more, &s;o as to be well under&s;tood by the dulle&s;t Reader, unle&s;s I am much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>He a&s;king (<HI>Pag.</HI> 8.) <Q>"Whether <HI>Phy&s;i|cians</HI> don't always make a &s;ad Out-cry,
<PB N="10" REF="9">and are not alarm'd as if their <HI>Craft</HI> was in danger, when <HI>Surgeons</HI> u&s;e <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Ink,</HI> except in PAUPER Ca&s;es,"</Q> is an indecent and fal&s;e Reflection on the Gentlemen of the Faculty. Herein he brands <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> that glorious Science, with the ignominious Name of a <HI>Craft;</HI> as if it were only a <HI>knavi&s;h</HI> Combination of Men to get Money, and at the &s;ame time openly taxes them with <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Hardne&s;s of Heart,</HI> in denying their Ad|vice to <HI>Paupers.</HI> It is well known, that all the Gentlemen of that Profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e Advice is worth having, are very <HI>charitable,</HI> and willing to relieve the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Poor, without any View or Ex|pectation of <HI>Gratification.</HI> And where he can give me an In&s;tance of one <HI>Surgeon's</HI> curing a <HI>Wound,</HI> &s;etting a <HI>Fracture,</HI> or re|ducing a <HI>di&s;located Limb,</HI> for nothing, I'll undertake to bring him <HI>five Phy&s;icians</HI> in this Town that have attended in the mo&s;t noi&s;ome and contagious Di&s;tempers, without the lea&s;t De&s;ire of <HI>Reward:</HI> Nay, &s;o far from it, they have relieved the Poor they have thus generou&s;ly cur'd, with Money and other Nece&s;&s;aries out of their own private Bounty. But I &s;hall leave this to the Re&s;entment of tho&s;e to whom it belongs.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Page he &s;ays, that the Doctor allows Midwives are compell'd to
<PB N="11" REF="10">do their be&s;t, as <HI>God</HI> &s;hall direct them; to which he replies: <HI>Now &s;uppo&s;ing God &s;hould direct one of them to make u&s;e of a</HI> Crotchet, <HI>in a fit Ca&s;e, and after a proper manner, mu&s;t &s;he be try'd for her Life for it?</HI> Which is another &s;hocking Joke upon the <HI>Godhead,</HI> equal, if not &s;uperior to that before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Here too is another <HI>Coax</HI> to the <HI>Lon|don</HI> Midwomen, that the hardie&s;t of them would tremble, upon his Belief, at the very thought of a <HI>Crotchet,</HI> unle&s;s they were fully in&s;tructed how to u&s;e it. But poor unfortunate <HI>Country Midwomen!</HI> he cannot pretend to an&s;wer for them: They are at too remote a di&s;tance from <HI>Lad Lane</HI> to come to his <HI>Lectures;</HI> and if upon this melancholy occa&s;ion I may be allow'd to borrow a Scrap of <HI>Latin</HI> from him, <HI>proh dolor!</HI> O lack! Olack!</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 9. Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> a&s;ks, <HI>if</HI> Dr. Cham|berlen<HI>'s Cobweb is not ea&s;ily &s;een thro'?</HI> Now, were I di&s;po&s;ed to Ill-nature, with how much more Ju&s;tice might I apply this Saying to his own?</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 12. He &s;eems to own my Ob&s;er|vation on Dr. <HI>Chamberlen</HI>'s Secret ju&s;t. But I was unwilling, like Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> to make any farther Remark upon it; and thought,
<PB N="12" REF="11">what I &s;aid &s;ufficient, without an unman|nerly Freedom.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 13. He be&s;tows upon Dr. <HI>Cham|berlen</HI> the ignominious Title of a <HI>ma|gi&s;terial</HI> and <HI>dictatorial</HI> Writer.</P>
<P>Not content with this, in the next Page (14.) he very candidly calls him, a <HI>ful|&s;ome Repeater,</HI> a <HI>nau&s;eous Recommender</HI> of his <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> a Writer that has not made one Remark to the Advantage of Mid|women, and one who &s;eems to have had nothing el&s;e in view, but to tell them when they ought to &s;end for him, and to let them know, that he, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could &s;erve them better than any body el&s;e. All which may be reckoned as Proofs of Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s want of <HI>Candour</HI> and <HI>good Manners.</HI> And now to make u&s;e of his own Words, <HI>utrum horum, p.</HI> 54.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 20. He owns, that <HI>Surgeons</HI> who have made any con&s;iderable Di&s;covery in <HI>manual Operations,</HI> which cannot be made univer&s;ally u&s;eful, as <HI>Medicines</HI> may, and really are, unle&s;s they are fully and di|&s;tinctly explain'd, &s;hould always commu|nicate <HI>gratis</HI> the Fruits of their Labour and Expence. No, &s;ays he, they ought to be hand&s;omely <HI>rewarded,</HI> not only for the real Service they have done, but to
<PB N="13" REF="12">encourage Indu&s;try in others. Why then does he accu&s;e me for keeping the u&s;e of the <HI>Fillet</HI> a Secret, which is in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e a <HI>manual</HI> Operation, and one that cannot be made univer&s;ally u&s;eful, as Me|dicines may? Indeed he has here &s;poke my own private Sentiments; in this we en|tirely agree: and I pre&s;ume he will hard|ly hereafter a&s;k me, why I don't com|municate it? He him&s;elf, it &s;eems from his own Words, cannot expect it <HI>gratis;</HI> &s;o that he mu&s;t fir&s;t tell me what he will be plea&s;ed to offer, before, we can come to any other Terms. However, for his Comfort, I promi&s;e him to be more rea|&s;onable than he &s;ays Dr. <HI>Chamberlen</HI> was with the <HI>French</HI> King's <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> p. 19. and to be contented with le&s;s than Ten thou&s;and Crowns; tho' in Proportion to the Superiority Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> always &s;eems to think <HI>Surgeons</HI> have over <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> I ought at lea&s;t to in&s;i&s;t upon Twenty thou|&s;and.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 21. He &s;ays Dr. <HI>Chamberlen is in|&s;olent,</HI> and there very candidly ranks <HI>Do|ctors, Apothecaries, Shavers,</HI> and <HI>No&s;trum|mongers,</HI> all together; but has wi&s;ely left the <HI>Surgeons,</HI> and con&s;equently him&s;elf, out of the Number, as being <HI>&s;uperioris &s;ortis</HI> (&s;till to borrow a little more of his Learn|ing) to <HI>Doctors</HI> and <HI>Apothecaries.</HI> And now the Town has been informed of their &s;u|perior
<PB N="14" REF="13">Merit, I hope no body will dare, after this publick Notification, to refu&s;e them their proper Homage, upon pain of Mr. <HI>John Dougla&s;s</HI>'s Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Page he puts a Que&s;tion which no body ever denied: Whether the Good which <HI>Surgeons</HI> do their Patients be not as evident as the Sun? <HI>E. g.</HI> When they cut for the <HI>Stone,</HI> perforate the <HI>Scull,</HI> reduce a <HI>Luxation,</HI> &amp;c. But it is doubt|ful, it &s;eems, from <HI>Baglivi,</HI> whether the Cures &s;uppos'd to be performed by <HI>Phy|&s;icians,</HI> even tho&s;e of the <HI>fir&s;t Rank,</HI> are mo&s;tly owing to Nature, or the <HI>Medicines, &amp;c.</HI> which they directed. No one, that I know of, has ever que&s;tion'd the Good which <HI>Surgeons</HI> do in their own proper Profe&s;&s;ion; but I am afraid, when they go beyond their <HI>La&s;t,</HI> they'll doubly ve|rify <HI>Baglivi</HI>'s Saying of the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> and do more Harm than they are capable of fore&s;eeing. <HI>Surgeons,</HI> he ob&s;erves, only practi&s;e <HI>Midwifery</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and &s;o, &s;ays he, <HI>they ought to do every where el&s;e.</HI> What then in his Wi&s;dom he will propo&s;e to be done with &s;uch <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> as are en|gag'd in this Profe&s;&s;ion, I know not, un|le&s;s he will generou&s;ly procure them to be promoted to the Dignity of <HI>Shavers</HI> (among which he ju&s;t now cho&s;e to rank them) for which the <HI>Faculty</HI> ought doubt|le&s;s to be extreamly thankful.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>A little after, he accu&s;es the Doctor of going out of his <HI>Ken;</HI> but why? Only becau&s;e he pretends to advi&s;e the <HI>Surgeons.</HI> And in the next Page (22.) to be even with him for this <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> affirms, that the Doctor did not under&s;tand that very little part of <HI>Surgery,</HI> the Method of cutting Childrens Gums, &s;o well as the very <HI>Nur&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame Page he hints, as if the Doctor was not appris'd of the u&s;e of the <HI>Crotchet;</HI> and in the next Page (23.) concludes, that Mr. <HI>Mauriceau</HI> was a good and faithful <HI>Surgeon,</HI> and <HI>Chamberlen</HI> only a &mdash; <HI>Doctor,</HI> with a long Da&s;h before it. It is to be hop'd, Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> may &s;o far overcome his <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> as in the next Edition of his elaborate Performance, to fill up the <HI>Blanks</HI> that are in this. If the <HI>Antithe&s;is</HI> here is to hold good, and Mr. <HI>Mauriceau</HI> was a good and faithful <HI>Surgeon,</HI> which I will not deny, the contrary Cha|racter mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall upon Dr. <HI>Chamber|len</HI> as a <HI>Phy&s;ician.</HI> But how far Mr. <HI>Dou|gla&s;s</HI> is capable of judging of the Qualifi|cations of a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> or who &s;et him up for a <HI>Cen&s;or,</HI> I mu&s;t leave the <HI>Faculty</HI> to determine.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 24. He &s;ums up the whole he has to &s;ay in relation to Dr. <HI>Chamberlen,</HI>

<P>In the fir&s;t place, he charges me with <HI>com|plimenting</HI> the Midwomen, becau&s;e I wrote a Book for their Improvement, and thought that all the Treati&s;es, hitherto written on this Sub|ject, were calculated more for the In&s;truction of my own Sex than the other. <HI>Pag.</HI> 41.

<P>Be&s;ides, if <HI>forty</HI> Per&s;ons, as well as Madam <HI>Du Tertre,</HI> had made the &s;ame Improvements and Ob&s;ervations in Practice, and wrote them in a <HI>Language</HI> I do not under&s;tand how does that <HI>detract</HI> from, or <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> any thing I ad|vance?

<P>In the next place he taxes me with having the &s;ame Aim he has the A&s;&s;urance to a&s;&s;ert Dr. <HI>Chamberlen</HI> had; namely, <HI>to tell the Mid|women, when, and in what particular Ca&s;es to &s;end for my &s;uperior Advice, and not to in&s;truct them how to give better A&s;&s;i&s;tance them&s;elves.</HI> After the very indecent Freedom he has taken with the Character of Dr. <HI>Chamberlen,</HI> I can|not wonder at any he can take with <HI>mine,</HI> as mo&s;t willingly owning my own Inferiority.

<P>A much greater In&s;tance, of his being but little conver&s;ant in this Art, he gives us in the very next Page, where, upon my &s;aying that few Midwives are &s;ufficiently appriz'd of the unhappy Symptom there mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> a violent <HI>Flooding,</HI> he declares, that he differs &s;o far from me, in this A&s;&s;ertion, that, in his Opinion, there is not <HI>one</HI> Midwife in a <HI>thou&s;and</HI> who knows not, that a violent Flood|ing will either occa&s;ion Abortion or Death. I confe&s;s few, if any Midwives, can be &s;o totally ignorant, as not to know that <HI>Flooding</HI> will occa&s;ion Death if no Stop be put to its Fury. Yet many are apt to flatter them&s;elves, that the Sufferer may be deliver'd by her natural Pains, till it is too late, as appears from &s;everal Ca&s;es I have cited (few to what I could have given) which &s;hews they were not &s;ufficiently appriz'd of the Danger. And I hope I may be excu&s;ed being &s;o full on this Head, as many have been before me, &s;ince it is a Thing of &s;uch va&s;t Con&s;equence in <HI>Practice.</HI></P>
<PB N="30" REF="29">
<P>But to return back to Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s Ob|&s;ervation in relation to what I advanc'd about the <HI>Navel-&s;tring, Pag.</HI> 48. I thought it proper to mention what I have there &s;aid, as I had very often found the leaving &s;o much of the String to be a common Practice, and indeed the Cu&s;tom, of mo&s;t Midwives in the Country. I never once mention'd it as a <HI>Secret;</HI> &s;o the FUSS about it, as he <HI>elegantly</HI> words it, is with <HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Again, as to his Quere, whether it is not every Body's Practice to pa&s;s their Hand immediately and examine if there are any more Children, and if no more, to fetch the <HI>Placenta?</HI> I an&s;wer No; not even among the A&s;&s;i&s;tants of my <HI>own</HI> Sex, much le&s;s with the <HI>Women,</HI> for I a&s;&s;ert that few of them take this Method.</P>
<P>Few Midwives, even in this <HI>Town,</HI> pa&s;s their Hand (if I may give credit to <HI>their</HI> Declara|tion, and my own <HI>Experience</HI>) and fewer yet in the Country. So that the Woman in who&s;e Ca&s;e this is mention'd had really &s;tood but a bad Chance; had an ignorant Midwife been call'd in upon her, as I have there affirm'd. Here Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has certainly burnt his Fingers, and taken hold of one of the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations in my whole Book; which may &s;erve to &s;hew his extraordinary <HI>Judgment.</HI> That few Mid|wives in this Town do pa&s;s their Hand is an
<PB N="31" REF="30">Affirmation I dare &s;ubmit to the Chief of the Profe&s;&s;ion. Pray whence comes it that we are &s;o often &s;ent for to extract the <HI>Placenta?</HI></P>
<P>Is not what I have wrote on this Subject Matter of <HI>In&s;truction</HI> to Midwives? And there|fore as it is again&s;t my own Intere&s;t, it mu&s;t be judg'd to be <HI>hone&s;t</HI> at lea&s;t, which, I tru&s;t will have no &s;mall Weight in my Fa|vour.</P>
<P>If I have written any thing that will not &s;tand the Te&s;t, but that my <HI>Herculean</HI> Anta|goni&s;t does not pretend to, why do not proper Judges di&s;prove me? If nothing but what will &s;tand the Trial, why mu&s;t I be loaded with &s;uch trifling and malicious <HI>Cavils?</HI> Really I think no one more unhappy, than he who <HI>&s;narls,</HI> and &s;hews his <HI>Teeth,</HI> yet cannot <HI>bite;</HI> and I at once de&s;pi&s;e and pity &s;uch a Per&s;on.</P>
<P>All Midwives are not <HI>Du Tertre</HI>'s; and why I &s;hould not &s;ay, <HI>this is my con&s;tant Practice,</HI> I know not; nor do I &s;ee wherein I could offend any Per&s;on thereby (and nothing &s;urely but <HI>Calumny and Ill-nature</HI> could ever have &s;ug|ge&s;ted a Cen&s;ure from this.) How wrongfully then does he accu&s;e me of having condemn'd the Midwives unju&s;tly, becau&s;e I affirm, that if an ignorant Midwife had been concern'd in the Ca&s;e abovementioned, who had only taken the fir&s;t Child and After-birth, the la&s;t would pro|bably
<PB N="32" REF="31">have been left behind, and either violent Flooding, or a bad Fever would have en&s;ued; and, as the Woman was before ill, and ex|treamly weak, it would very likely have co&s;t her her Life? Is not what I have &s;aid <HI>true?</HI> Can what is here &s;poken, of an <HI>ignorant</HI> Mid|wife, belong to a <HI>good</HI> one? And would not one, ignorant of her Profe&s;&s;ion, have occa&s;ion'd in all Probability the Misfortune I there men|tion? For I &s;ay again, that few do pa&s;s their Hand. Upon the whole then, I think I may with mo&s;t Ju&s;tice retort his own Words upon him, and apply what he &s;ays of the Midwives to my&s;elf, <HI>viz. That, guilty or not guilty, 'tis all one,</HI> I mu&s;t be <HI>haul'd in, and condemn'd for an imaginary as well as a real Fault.</HI> Pag. 50.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 51. He relates the Ca&s;e of my being &s;ent for to a Gentlewoman who kept a Tavern at <HI>Ip&s;wich, viz.</HI> that the Child was <HI>dead,</HI> and the Mother <HI>flooding;</HI> that when two Midwives and a <HI>Surgeon,</HI> ju&s;t then &s;et out in the Profe&s;&s;ion, had all us'd their Endeavours to little or no Purpo&s;e, I was call'd in, and deliver'd her in a Minute; that I left her under the Care of Dr. <HI>Bee&s;ton,</HI> but that &s;he died in &s;ix or &s;even Days. Upon this he very candidly ob&s;erves, that I have not indeed told this young Gentle|man's Name, tho' I have de&s;crib'd him &s;o well that he doubts there's not a Man in all <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> nor perhaps <HI>twenty</HI> Miles round, but can tell who I mean; and then craftily in&s;inuates, <HI>What Injury might not &s;uch a Tale do a worthy
<PB N="33" REF="32">young Fellow?</HI> And twits me with being incon|&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf, in relation to the Advice I gave in <HI>Pag.</HI> 114. of my fir&s;t Edition; namely, that we &s;hould not take an unkind Advantage of a Slip or Accident that may happen to befal a Brother in his Practice.</P>
<P>I hope I cannot fairly be charg'd with being incon&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf, or taking an unkind Advantage of a Brother, whereas the Publica|tion of my E&s;&s;ay was many Years after the Ca&s;e referr'd to, and the young Surgeon there mention'd, had in all Probability, either given up that Branch of Practice, or was well e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in it.</P>
<P>In the next Page he cites a Pa&s;&s;age from my <HI>Preface,</HI> wherein I &s;ay that the Dignity of this Art will appear to every Per&s;on in a much more advantageous Light, if we reflect on the Learning of the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, and then ig|nominiou&s;ly &s;ubjoins, <HI>E.

It is much to be wi&s;h'd that Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> had conde&s;cended &s;o far as to have fill'd up this formidable Catalogue of Blanks, that the Gentlemen, he there reflects upon, might have a fair Opportunity of defending them&s;elves from &s;uch &s;currilous Treatment. Is this being con|&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, to charge me with <HI>de|tracting from a young Surgeon</HI>'s <HI>Character,</HI> in &s;o <HI>favourable</HI> a Manner; as not to give even the initial Letter of his Name; when in the very
<PB N="34" REF="33">next Paragraph, he uncharitably and malici|ou&s;ly in&s;ults the Reputation of no le&s;s than &s;even Phy&s;icians, as he him&s;elf &s;eems to own, by giving them all the Title of Doctor; but if by this he would only aim at tho&s;e who would willingly impo&s;e them&s;elves upon the World as &s;uch, he &s;hould have told us their real Names, that Gentlemen of Learning and Character may not &s;uffer thereby; there being &s;everal Phy&s;icians of Reputation in this City, the initial Letters of who&s;e Names are the <HI>&s;ame</HI> he has thought fit to &s;et down.</P>
<P>Upon my &s;aying, that the Improvements the&s;e, great Men have made in this Art, have effectually wip'd away the Load of Slander and Ignominy, with which this Profe&s;&s;ion was formerly branded, he has the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> to a&s;k, for I can call it nothing el&s;e, if <HI>ninety nine</HI> in a <HI>hundred</HI> (a pretty large Proportion truly) of the&s;e great Men I talk of, have not kept their Im|provements to them&s;elves?

And if they don't endeavour to <HI>puzzle,</HI> at the &s;ame time they make a &s;how of <HI>in&s;tructing</HI> others? Don't they, &s;ays he likewi&s;e, <HI>very &s;eldom, if ever, con&s;ult together, as they always ought to do in difficult or
<PB N="35" REF="34">dangerous Ca&s;es?</HI> And then a&s;ks, <HI>What can hinder them, except the Fear of di&s;covering the In&s;ignificancy of their pretended Secret, or their</HI> REAL IGNORANCE? What intolerable U&s;age is here? What Opinion mu&s;t By-&s;tanders have of the Profe&s;&s;ion, when one, who would im|po&s;e him&s;elf upon the Town as a <HI>Judge,</HI> repre&s;ents the Profe&s;&s;ors of it as a Set of <HI>crafty, puzzling, ignorant</HI> People? How far his Fellow Citizens are to thank him, for deterring, by fal&s;e and malicious Hints, tho&s;e who are already (from a mi&s;taken and blameable Mode&s;ty) too aver&s;e to the A&s;&s;i&s;|tance of Men-Midwives, in Ca&s;es of Extre|mity, where a faithful <HI>Wife,</HI> or hopeful <HI>Heir</HI> may perhaps be lo&s;t, is what I think every rea&s;onable Man may determine. But I &s;hall leave him to the Re&s;entment of tho&s;e worthy Gen|tlemen he has &s;o much in&s;ulted, and only ob|&s;erve farther on this Head, that I well hop'd, (and &s;till with Rea&s;on do) that the late, and pre&s;ent Practitioners, had wip'd off the Load of Scandal that was us'd to blacken this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ign'd a ju&s;t Compliment to them. But nothing can &s;tand good where <HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Ill-nature</HI> meet. And indeed if they have not done it, I can only be accus'd of being too <HI>complai&s;ant;</HI> which is a Fault I mu&s;t do Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> the Ju&s;tice to own he has no where in his Book been guilty of, unle&s;s once to his Friend and <HI>Countryman,</HI> Dr. <HI>Mitchell,</HI> as will pre&s;ently be made appear.</P>

For his &s;aying that the re|maining Part of the <HI>Placenta</HI> will <HI>often</HI> come away with the <HI>Lochia,</HI> implies that it will not <HI>always</HI> do &s;o; and that it will do no <HI>great harm</HI> plainly intimates that it may do <HI>&s;ome.</HI> The <HI>Womb</HI> to be &s;ure is never to be hurt,
<PB N="43" REF="42">in extracting the <HI>Placenta;</HI> and when it cannot be got away, without doing more harm than the Retention of it may occa|&s;ion (which I believe but &s;eldom happens) it mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be left behind. But then this is nothing to the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of its being always taken away, which is what I have &s;o earne&s;tly recommended. Will Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> affirm, that it is ever &s;afer to have it <HI>retain'd,</HI> than <HI>extracted?</HI> I hope he will not pretend to give this Advice in his <HI>Lectures,</HI> le&s;t Mankind &s;hould be but little indebted to him, and the State of <HI>Midwifery,</HI> after his mighty Endea|vours to reform it, be left in a much wor&s;e Condition than he found it. This ought to be look'd upon as one of the mo&s;t certain <HI>Maxims</HI> in Practice, that, where it can po&s;&s;ibly be done, the Womb ought to be clear'd, and nothing &s;uffer'd to be included in it, le&s;t a <HI>Fever</HI> or <HI>Flooding</HI> &s;hould en&s;ue, which are but too com|monly the Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Neglect.</P>
<P>A little after, he &s;ays, I give one In&s;tance of a Child I deliver'd with the <HI>Buttocks</HI> fore|mo&s;t, and then a&s;ks, how does this <HI>quadrate,</HI> with what I &s;ay, <HI>Pag.</HI> 11. of the &s;ame Book. <Q>"If the Child offers any other part than the Head, the Hand is to be pa&s;&s;ed into the, Womb, the Feet &s;earch'd for, and the Child, to be turn'd, and brought forth by them."</Q> Here he wilfully omits an Exception I make in the very next Line, thus: <HI>But there is one Ca&s;e to be excepted, viz. when the Child pre&s;ents the Buttocks, and is far advanc'd in that Po&s;ture,
<PB N="44" REF="43">even beyond the</HI> Labia; <HI>it is then to be extracted as it lies: which I &s;hould chu&s;e to perform by pa&s;&s;ing a Finger or two of one Hand, or if po&s;&s;i|ble of both Hands to the Groin, and thus bring the Child away, rather than attempt the</HI> FEET: This however can be done only when the Child is &s;mall, or the Woman large; otherwi&s;e the Woman is to be laid on her <HI>Back,</HI> with her Hips <HI>rais'd,</HI> and her Shoulders <HI>low,</HI> and then the Child to be return'd, &s;o as the Feet may be commanded.</P>

He proceeds, "Is it not the Art of Midwifery, which the Midwomen have been taught, the only thing which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from other Women? Are not they oblig'd to make u&s;e of their Art at every Labour they are call'd to? Why then does he &s;o often make u&s;e of the Words <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Arti&s;ts,</HI> and only apply them to him&s;elf and &s;ome other <HI>Men?</HI> Won't any one, who reads Madam <HI>Du Tertre</HI>'s little Book, be convinc'd, that &s;he has &s;hewn more Art, and better Diction, than either Dr. <HI>Maubray,</HI> or &mdash; Does her being a Woman make it improper to &s;ay, &s;he had Recour&s;e to <HI>Art,</HI> or that &s;he was an <HI>Arti&s;t?"</HI></Q></P>
<PB N="45" REF="44">
<P>I &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, that all the com|mon A&s;&s;i&s;tance was before given; and as all Arti&s;ts well know, the Expul&s;ion now lay wholly upon <HI>Nature,</HI> except the taking hold of the <HI>Head,</HI> which I was unwilling to come to, if Nature would have fini&s;h'd her Work her&s;elf.

<PB N="49" REF="48">and think that it is <HI>the Fear of his di&s;covering the In&s;ignificancy of his pretended Lectures, or his own real Ignorance?</HI> Utrum horum.</P>
<P>Upon my relating that a Woman had been twice or thrice deliver'd by a Man, of Chil|dren that always pre&s;ented with the Head, which the Operator took a fatal Freedom with, <HI>viz.</HI> u&s;ing the <HI>Hook,</HI> he a&s;ks, <Q>"How I could tell, who was not pre&s;ent, but that all the&s;e Children were <HI>dead?"</HI></Q> So that in one Place he blames me for <HI>not</HI> finding fault with People where they de&s;erve it, <HI>Pag.</HI> 58. and now he condemns me becau&s;e I <HI>do,</HI> and endeavours to excu&s;e the Per&s;on in a Fault, tho' he was <HI>not pre&s;ent</HI> him&s;elf, and con&s;equently can know nothing of the Matter.

<PB N="50" REF="49">thinking me to blame for not &s;aying, whether this fatal Freedom-taker was a <HI>Doctor</HI> or an <HI>Ayothecary Midman;</HI> probably I may bethought much more culpable, when I tell him that it was a SURGEON <HI>Midman;</HI> but as to the Truth of this Relation, I have all the Rea&s;on in the World to believe the Children were <HI>living,</HI> if Credit may be given to no le&s;s than <HI>three</HI> Matrons who were pre&s;ent at the &s;everal La|bours, and all a&s;&s;erted the Fact.

<P>In the &s;ame Page he excu&s;es me in a great mea&s;ure, tho' perhaps not intentionally, for having &s;lipp'd the Mention of a Child's ad|vancing with the <HI>Buttocks</HI> in my fir&s;t Edition, by ob&s;erving that Dr. <HI>Nicholls</HI> has omitted the it in the following remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>In omni malo &s;itu, ut &amp; in rebus de&s;peratis, pedi|bus extrahetur Foetus.</HI> Compend.

<P>Having thus, as he thinks, triumph'd over Dr. <HI>Chamberlen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> and my&s;elf, he proceeds to make what he calls <HI>Deductions</HI> from the Premi&s;es; and after expatiating upon the Havock that is oftentimes made among his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, by the Ignorance of <HI>Mid|women,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="50">he a&s;ks, if calling of Names, &s;uch as rude, rough, negligent, ignorant, fooli&s;h, ob|&s;tinate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we have &s;o liberally be&s;tow'd upon them, will make them more prudent or judicious, or enable them in any degree to give better A&s;&s;i&s;tance them&s;elves, and then replies in the Negative.

<P>Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> thinks (<HI>Page</HI> 68.) this fatal Di&s;temper may be cur'd, and all its bad Con|&s;equences for the future avoided, if it was put in the Power of the <HI>Midwomen</HI> to qualify them&s;elves thoroughly, and at a moderate Expence, in all the Parts of their mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Office, before they are permitted to practi&s;e. In order to attain this mo&s;t de&s;irable End, Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> propo&s;es, Fir&s;t, the erecting an <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> (at the pub|lick Expence, by <HI>Donation</HI> or <HI>Sub&s;criptions,</HI> as &s;everal <HI>Alms-hou&s;es, Infirmaries, Ho&s;pitals,</HI> &amp;c. of far le&s;s Con&s;equence to the Common-weal, have been, and are daily carried on) for the Reception of about two or three hundred poor Women who are big with Child.

Fourthly, That every young Woman, who de&s;igns to practi&s;e Midwifery, be oblig'd to attend the&s;e Cour&s;es, during her Apprentice&s;hip&punc; then go and practi&s;e, for a &s;et Time, under tho&s;e expert Women in that <HI>Ho&s;pital;</HI> after|wards let them be examin'd, as to the Skill and

<P>The Profe&s;&s;ion might certainly receive great Advantage; but to extirpate Ignorance, to that Degree, is a very hard Ta&s;k indeed.

<P>But Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> having &s;ome Rea&s;on to doubt, whether the <HI>Publick</HI> would take any notice of this <HI>Scheme</HI> or not, has propos'd another Expedient in the Interim, and that is, <HI>to give a Cour&s;e of Midwifery to</HI> Mid|women <HI>only</HI> (for the <HI>Men</HI> it &s;eems are to be depriv'd of this va&s;t Advantage) wherein he promi&s;es <HI>that the principal Operations of that Art &s;hall be briefly explained</HI> (Pag. ult.)

<P>Here Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has openly acknowledged him&s;elf to be but an <HI>Old-woman;</HI> which is the fir&s;t mode&s;t Conce&s;&s;ion I have met with throughout his Book. How far that threatening <HI>Parenthe&s;is</HI> in <HI>Pag.</HI> 68. viz. <HI>That they, who did not readily embrace the Opportunity, would not only be de&s;ervedly blam'd, but ought to be</HI> puni&s;h'd <HI>by the Civil Magi&s;trate,</HI> may influence. Women to come to tho&s;e Lectures, I mu&s;t leave.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="58">
<P>Tho&s;e, who pretend to in&s;truct others in any Art, ought, to he Well vers'd in it them&s;elves; and as Midwifery is a <HI>Manual</HI> Operation, &s;o it cannot well be acquir'd but by a due Cour&s;e of Practice. Whether Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has been much conver&s;ant in this Profe&s;&s;ion, I will not take upon me to determine; tho', I con|fe&s;s, I never heard any Preten&s;ions he had to <HI>Midwifery</HI> before he advertis'd the printing of his Book. Indeed he tells us in <HI>Pag.</HI> 58. <HI>That he knew the</HI> Placenta <HI>once left behind,</HI> which does not amount to any Proof of his practi&s;ing him&s;elf, for he might know that by <HI>Relation,</HI> without ever having really exercis'd this Art. But in <HI>Pag.</HI> 65. he goes farther, and informs us, that he has found the <HI>Sci&s;&s;ura rimae, ab Vulva ad Anum</HI> by REPEATED EXPE|RIENCE, not to be at all dangerous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he might have experienc'd as a <HI>Surgeon,</HI> and not profe&s;&s;edly as a <HI>Man-Midwife,</HI> it being com|monly a <HI>Surgeon's</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, and for which Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> might frequently have been con&s;ulted. There is no other Pa&s;&s;age to be met with in his whole Book, wherein he gives us the lea&s;t Hint of his having practis'd him&s;elf. From whence I think We may fairly conclude, that Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has bat very lately taken up this Profe&s;&s;ion; otherwi&s;e &s;urely he would not have omitted to have &s;aid &s;omething of his <HI>long Practice</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> in order to be|&s;peak the more favourable Opinion of him&s;elf among the good Women. Before Mr: <HI>Dou|gla&s;s</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="59">had made any Propo&s;als for <HI>Lectures</HI> to the Town, he ought at lea&s;t to have clear'd up this Doubt, <HI>Whether or no be ever deliver'd a Woman in his Life.</HI> If not, the Reader may judge how fit he is to take upon him the In&s;truction of others. He doubts not, <HI>P.</HI> 70. but the <HI>Midmen</HI> will object and &s;ay, <HI>That the</HI> Midwomen <HI>want both Capacity and Strength (in&s;truct them as you plea&s;e) to perform what he propo&s;es.</HI> To which he immediately replies, <Q>"That this is only an artful and groundle&s;s In&s;inuation, and affirms, <HI>ore rotundo, plenis buccis</HI> (as he chu&s;es to expre&s;s him&s;elf) that it is not want of Capacity, Docility, Strength, or Activity, but meerly want of fit and full In&s;tructions in all the Parts of their Office, which di&s;ables them to perform it in all Ca&s;es (excepting where In&s;truments are nece&s;&s;ary) with as much Ea&s;e, Safety, and Expedition, as the mo&s;t dextrous <HI>Midman, &amp;c."</HI></Q> Mu&s;t not this Gentleman be in great Want of Matter to &s;hew his Abilities upon, to haul in the <HI>Midmen</HI> making an Objection they probably never &s;o much as thought of? Before he had proceeded to this, he ought fir&s;t to have told us, <HI>ore rotundo, plenis buccis,</HI> as he affects to write, who ever doubted of the Womens want of Docility, Strength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor do I &s;ee what this Ob&s;ervation was brought in upon, unle&s;s it was for the Sake of this paultry Scrap of <HI>Latin,</HI> that the Women might take him for a great <HI>Scholliard,</HI> and admire his profound Knowledge in that learned Language,
<PB N="61" REF="60">like <HI>Scrub</HI> in the Play, who affirms, <Q>"That tho' he does not under&s;tand <HI>Latin,</HI> yet he thinks there's &s;omething very pretty in the Sound of it."</Q> As to their Want of fit In&s;tructions in their Profe&s;&s;ion, I have before ob&s;erv'd, that they have more Opportunities of Information from <HI>Books</HI> that have from Time to Time been printed for the Improvement of the Art of Midwifery, than many of them thro' Indolence and Self-&s;ufficiency ever made u&s;e of; as is very plain from their running counter in Prac|tice to the Rules there laid down. And I am much deceiv'd, if they may not meet with as much or more Information, from <HI>Books,</HI> for the Value of three or four <HI>Shillings,</HI> as they will from <HI>Lectures</HI> of &s;o many <HI>Guineas.</HI> Be&s;ides, the great Probability of what they hear in <HI>Lectures</HI> &s;lipping out of their Memory, whil&s;t a <HI>Book</HI> is always at Hand, and ready to give them con&s;tant and repeated In&s;truction, if they will but be at the Trouble of con&s;ulting it.</P>
<P><HI>Pag. 73.</HI> He a&s;ks, if all Ages have not produc'd Women, who have made a Figure in the mo&s;t &s;ublime Parts of Learning, and in all Manner of curious and u&s;eful Arts? (But what Nece&s;&s;ity for this Query? Who ever doubted it?) and then &s;ubjoins, and al&s;o illiterate, thick|headed <HI>Prie&s;ts, Lawyers,</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;icians?</HI> But what have the <HI>Lawyers</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> done to di&s;oblige Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> that they mu&s;t be haul'd in too, by the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Shoulders,</HI> in a Book of <HI>Midwifery?</HI> But all it &s;eems mu&s;t feel his <HI>critical La&s;h;</HI></P>
<PB N="62" REF="61">
<P>He hints, <HI>Pag.</HI> 73. That at the Time of Delivery it is lea&s;t proper for Men to come near the Women; forgetting that but a few Pages before (<HI>Pag.</HI> 67.) he blames the Women as ob&s;tinate and un&s;ea&s;onably mode&s;t, for not being willing to admit a <HI>Midman.</HI> But great <HI>Wits,</HI> they &s;ay, have &s;hort Memories.</P>
<P>But to draw towards a Conclu&s;ion; what is all that Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has &s;aid, in relation to my&s;elf? What has he detected in me that is <HI>wrong?</HI> Or what has he advanc'd from the Writings of his <HI>Old-Woman</HI> which I have not?</P>
<P>As to informing Midwives, and directing them when to call in &s;uperior A&s;&s;i&s;tance, what have I left un&s;aid? Or what Direction can be farther given them? Some of the chief of the Profe&s;&s;ion, of my own Sex, have told me I have been too <HI>open;</HI> &s;o that I'm found fault with on both Sides. But this gives me no Unea&s;ine&s;s. I have a Satisfaction in doing what I judg'd to be my <HI>Duty,</HI> and acting the Part of an hone&s;t Man which my Enemies can never be able to rob me of. My Way is to walk in the Path which Providence has put me in, as inoffen&s;ively as po&s;&s;ibly I can; ever to give the Wall to my <HI>Superiors,</HI> and never to jo&s;tle my Inferiors into the Kennel, or to affront any Per&s;on. But if a BULLY draws upon me, I never fly, but defend my&s;elf, with proper Force.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="62">
<P>I never &s;aid or did any thing to de&s;erve this mighty Man's Di&s;plea&s;ure; and yet &s;purr'd on by an envious, jealous Fury he has attack'd me: But alas, his Arm is too weak, and his <HI>Thru&s;ts</HI> are ea&s;ily <HI>parried;</HI> not to mention that by too much Heat he has over LUNGED.</P>
<P>Having now laid the whole of Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s Objections before the <HI>Reader,</HI> I will not &s;uppo&s;e that his main. Drift, after all his FUSS and SPLUTTER about the Reformation of Mid|wifery, was purely to &s;et him&s;elf up, as the only Dictator in this Profe&s;&s;ion, and to inform the good Women that he was better able to give them <HI>Lectures</HI> than any Body el&s;e. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the artful Methods he has made u&s;e of to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into publick Favour, by running down and di&s;commending every body el&s;e. It &s;eems they are all a Set of <HI>puzzling, de&s;igning</HI> Men, rather <HI>confounding</HI> and <HI>darkening,</HI> than <HI>illuminating</HI> their Profe&s;&s;ion. But Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has no De&s;ign; his <HI>Candour, Mode&s;ty,</HI> and good <HI>U&s;age</HI> of all he &s;peaks of, will, not &s;o much as admit of any &s;uch Su&s;picion. To be &s;ure he had no View of throwing a Cloud of Infamy and Ignorance over his <HI>Neighbour's</HI> Character, that his own might appear to the better Advantage. The <HI>Tenderne&s;s,</HI> he &s;hews for other People's Reputation, cannot fail of endearing him to the Town, and making every body as <HI>tender</HI> of his. I will not &s;o much as
<PB N="64" REF="63">mention what perhaps &s;ome People may &s;ay, that the Motto in the Front of his Book ought to be inverted, and read, <HI>non aliis, &s;ed &s;ibi.</HI> But the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Impartiality</HI> of this Author are of all his good Qualities the mo&s;t extraordinary, nor can the Reader well pa&s;s over the following remarkable In&s;tances of them. There is for Example, <HI>plain</HI> Dr. <HI>Hody,</HI> and the <HI>ingenious</HI> and <HI>experienc'd</HI> Mr. <HI>Will. Giffard, Surgeon,</HI> Pag, 52. the <HI>di&s;ingenious</HI> (Pag. 53.) <HI>&s;tupid</HI> (Pag. 54.) and <HI>ab&s;urd</HI> (Pag. 55.) Dr. <HI>Maubray,</HI> and the <HI>ju&s;t, tart, reverend,</HI> and <HI>learned</HI> Dr. MITCHELL <HI>Utriu&s;que Medicinae Doctor</HI> (Pag. 55.) The <HI>puzzling, confounding, artful, in&s;inua|ting, darkening</HI> (P.ag 3.) <HI>perverting, intere&s;ted, coaxing, threatening</HI> (Pag. 5.) <HI>Cobweb-&s;pinning, emu&s;ing</HI> (Pag. 9.) <HI>magi&s;terial, dictatorial</HI> (P. 13.) <HI>&s;ul&s;om, nau&s;eous</HI> (Pag. 14.) <HI>&s;neering, in&s;olent</HI> (Pag. 21.) <HI>imperious</HI> (Pag. 22.) NOSTRUM-MONGER (Pag. 4, 12, and 24.) Dr. <HI>Cham|berlen,</HI> and that accurate <HI>Anatomi&s;t,</HI> and <HI>con|&s;ummate Accoucher</HI> (his own Brother) Dr. <HI>James Dougla&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' to be &s;erious on this Head, I cannot think his worthy <HI>Brother</HI> has any Rea&s;on to thank him for &s;uch a ful&s;om Compliment. The truly learned are always <HI>mode&s;t,</HI> and a Gentleman, of Dr. <HI>James Dougla&s;s</HI>'s well known <HI>Merit</HI> and <HI>Abilities,</HI> can never &s;tand in need of a &s;uch a paultry PUFF as this.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> has gone long with this wondrous Birth; the fir&s;t Account we had
<PB N="65" REF="64">of this Gentleman's <HI>Pregnancy,</HI> was &s;everal Months before he was deliver'd, which at Length, on the <HI>29th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1736, we had Notice of. Some think it a <HI>mon&s;trous,</HI> others an <HI>abortive</HI> Birth; all agree, that it was not come to its <HI>full Perfection.</HI> But be that as it will, the <HI>Mountain</HI> was long in Labour, and at length, like that in the <HI>Fable,</HI> brought forth a MOUSE.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that this Book is printed for, and &s;old only by, the <HI>Author</HI> in <HI>Lad-Lane,</HI> near <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> at the Price of Two Shillings, tho' it contains but 75 Pages, and that in a loo&s;e Print; which is only double the u&s;ual Price of Pamphlets of that Size. Indeed &s;uch a Production, as this, dees not happen often; and it is but fitting, that an <HI>extraordinary Perfor|mance</HI> &s;hould be bought at an <HI>extraordinary Price.</HI> Which brings to my Mind a remark|able Ob&s;ervation I remember to have read in the <HI>Grub-&s;treet Journal</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 1. 1735, in relation to Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;</HI>'s Propo&s;als for a new O&s;teology tack'd to his trifling Remarks, on a Piece upon the &s;ame Subject, by an ingenious Author (to whom I am well inform'd Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> lay under the highe&s;t Obligations) <HI>viz.</HI> that he was much di&s;plea&s;ed with him for making Twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> of his Money, becau&s;e he had enter'd into the &s;ame De&s;ign, with a View of getting Five and Twenty him&s;elf, baiting and worrying him with all
<PB N="66" REF="65">the Boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;s of Pedantry and Ru&s;ticity, at the &s;ame Time that he expo&s;es his own Nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus far I have per&s;uaded my&s;elf to pro|ceed in my Remarks on Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s <HI>trifling</HI> and <HI>malicious</HI> Cavils; nor would I have him think, becau&s;e he came off unan&s;wer'd in his paultry Attempt to depreciate that valuable Work (the Author not thinking it worth his while to give him an An&s;wer) that therefore he is always to e&s;cape with Impunity.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> &s;eems to be in ha&s;te to di&s;po&s;e of the pre&s;ent Edition of his Book, probably becau&s;e he has &s;ome fre&s;h Ob&s;ervations to oblige the Town with in a future Edition of that elaborate Work.</P>
<P>But le&s;t he &s;hould imagine me ready, to an&s;wer any farther, &s;uch fal&s;e and dirty A&s;per|&s;ions as he may think fit to fling upon me, I here a&s;&s;ure him, once for all, that I have Affairs of much more Con&s;equence to mind, nor can I give him a better general An&s;wer, than what I am told the afore&s;aid Gentleman &s;ent him; when being a&s;k'd by an Acquain|tance of Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> if he would not give a Reply, he cooly an&s;wer'd, <HI>Whenever I have as little Bu&s;ine&s;s, or as much Malice as bim&s;elf, I will &s;et about it.</HI></P>
