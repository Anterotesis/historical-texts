<P>ROBERT ELLIOT, of Eyam, in Derby|&s;hire, a very healthful boy of nine years old, had the misfortune, about Mid&s;ummer, in the year 1759, by a fall, to fracture the humerus, near the middle of the bone. He was immediately taken to a bone-&s;etter in that neighbourhood, who applied a bandage and &s;plints to his arm, and treated him as properly, as, I &s;uppo&s;e, he was capable of, for two or three months. His endeavours, how|ever, were by no means productive of the de&s;ired effect, the bones not being at all united. A &s;urgeon of eminence, in
<PB N="6" REF="5">Bakewell, was afterwards called in; but, as &s;oon as he found he could be of no &s;ervice to him, and as the ca&s;e was very curious, he advi&s;ed the lad's friends to &s;end him to the infirmary at Manche&s;ter: He was accordingly brought thither the Chri&s;tmas following, and admitted an in|patient. Upon examination, we found it to have been a &s;imple oblique fracture, and that the ends of the bone rode over each other. His arm was become not only intirely u&s;ele&s;s, but even a burthen to him, and not likely to be otherwi&s;e, as there was little probability that it would ever unite, it being now near &s;ix months &s;ince the accident happened.</P>
<P>Amputation was therefore propo&s;ed as the only method of relief; but I could not give my con&s;ent to that; for, as the boy was young, and had a good con&s;ti|tution, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible that it could be owing to any fault in the &s;olids or fluids, but that either nature was di&s;|appointed in her work by frequent fric|tion, while the callus was forming; or
<PB N="7" REF="6">rather, that the oblique ends of the bone, being &s;harp, had divided a part of a mu&s;cle, and &s;ome portion of it had probably in&s;inuated it&s;elf betwixt the two ends of the bone, preventing their union: Which ever of the&s;e might be the ca&s;e, I was of opinion, that he might be relieved by the following operation, viz. to make a longitudinal inci&s;ion down to the bone, to bring out one of the ends of it (which might be done with great ea&s;e, as the arm was very flexible) and cut off the oblique end, either by the &s;aw or cutting-pincers; then to bring out the other end of the bone, and cut off that likewi&s;e; afterwards to re-place them end to end, and then treat it in|tirely as a compound fracture.</P>
<P>The objections made, by the other gentlemen concerned, to this propo&s;al, were, 1&s;t, The danger of wounding the humeral artery by the knife; 2dly, the laceration of the artery by bringing out the ends of the bones; and, 3dly, that we had no authority for &s;uch an opera|tion.
<PB N="8" REF="7">As to the fir&s;t, that was ea&s;ily ob|viated, by making the inci&s;ion on the &s;ide of the arm oppo&s;ite to the humeral ar|tery: The place of election appeared to me to be at the external and lower edge of the deltoid mu&s;cle, as the fracture was very near to the in&s;ertion of that mu&s;cle into the humerus; the danger of wounding the ve&s;&s;el not only being by that means avoided, but after the opera|tion, while the patient was confined to his bed, the matter would be prevented from lodging, and the wound be ea&s;ily come at, to renew the dre&s;&s;ings. The &s;econd objection will not appear to be very great, when we con&s;ider, that in compound fractures, the bone is fre|quently thru&s;t with great violence through the integuments, and &s;eldom attended with the laceration of any con&s;iderable artery; and, as this would be done with great care and caution, that danger would appear very trifling. The third and la&s;t objection is no more than a general one to all improvements.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>This method, which I have been pro|po&s;ing, was at la&s;t re&s;olved upon, and I a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the operation, which was per|formed by a gentleman of great abilities in his profe&s;&s;ion, on the 3d of January, in the pre&s;ent year. The patient did not lo&s;e above a &s;poonful of blood in the operation, though the tourniquet was not made u&s;e of. When the operation and dre&s;&s;ings were fini&s;hed, the limb was placed in a fracture-box contrived on purpo&s;e, the lad confined to his bed, and the re&s;t of the treatment nothing dif|ferent from that of a compound fracture.</P>
<P>The wound was nearly healed in a fortnight's time, when an eri&s;ipelas came on, and &s;pread it&s;elf all over the arm, at|tended with &s;ome degree of &s;welling; this, by fomentations, and the antiphlo|gi&s;tic method, &s;oon went off, and the cure proceeded happily, without any other interruption. In about &s;ix weeks after the operation, the callus began to form, and is now grown quite firm:
<PB N="10" REF="9">That arm is as long as the other, but &s;omewhat &s;maller, by &s;uch long-con|tinued bandage; he daily acquires &s;trength in it, and will &s;oon be fit to be di&s;|charged.</P>

<P>AS the ca&s;e of Robert Elliot, &s;o artfully written by Mr. Charles White, and &s;ent to George Lloyd, E&s;q; without my knowledge or con&s;ent, to be communicated to the Royal Society, hath met with a place in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, and &s;ince been publi&s;hed in the Monthly and Critical Reviews, and in Lloyd's Chronicle, wherein Mr. White has taken the &s;ole merit of the cure to him&s;elf, I think, without apology, I may be allowed to declare the truth, that Robert El|liot was my patient, and was admitted as &s;uch into the Infirmary at Manche&s;ter on the 24th of December, 1759, when, after a previous con&s;ultation (agreeable to the printed rules) it was agreed to try the method, as related by Mr. White in his paper; and accordingly I performed the operation on the 3d of January, 1760, in pre&s;ence of him and &s;everal of the faculty (who, as is u&s;ual in capital operations, give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance) by making an inci&s;ion through the integuments, in the In|ter&s;tice of the mu&s;cles on the external part of the hu|merus, and &s;orcing the extremities of the fractured bone, out of the wound, which were afterwards cut off with the cutting forceps: I then reduced the bones as near as could be in point of contact, and placed the arm in a fracture-box, afterwards I treated it as a compound fracture. I duly attended him till the cure was com|pleated, which was about the beginning of April; but for fear of any accident affecting the arm, as the boy was of a very lively and heedle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the place of his abode, he was not di&s;charged from the Infirmary till the 5th of May, 1760.</P>

<P>A Letter from <HI>Mr. James Burchall, introduced by an|other, pretended to be written by a friend of his</HI> (both of them publi&s;hed in your Chronicle of the 7th of this month) oblige me, in common ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, to give you this trouble. The intention of them was to in&s;inuate to the publick, that I had mi&s;repre&s;ented <HI>a ca&s;e,</HI> publi&s;hed in the 51&s;t vol. of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;ac|tions, entitled,</P>

<P>I &s;hall make no remarks upon the <HI>inaccuracy</HI> with which Mr. J. F. has cau&s;ed you to print this title, in which, by the alteration of a point, the &s;en&s;e was en|tirely &s;ubverted. I am ready to attribute it rather to his heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s, than to any wilful de&s;ign of mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion. In the&s;e letters I am charged with <HI>a&s;&s;uming</HI> to my|&s;elf <HI>the &s;ole merit of the cure.</HI> How far I did this, mu&s;t be left to every impartial reader of the tran&s;action. The merit I a&s;&s;umed to my&s;elf was only that of the inven|tion; and, if the invention be of any &s;ervice to the pub|lick, that merit I believe neither Mr. Burchall nor his friend will deny me. The operation I no where called my own; I only a&s;&s;erted, that "I a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it;" and I &s;aid, that it "was performed by a gentleman of great "abilities in his profe&s;&s;ion." Had I thought that the &s;hare which Mr. Burchall had in the operation could po&s;&s;ibly have redounded to his credit, I &s;hould have had no objection to entring into particulars and to the in&s;er|tion of his name, e&s;pecially as I have always looked upon him as a man of honour and knowledge in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and have con&s;tantly entertained a great regard for him; but I am now publickly called upon, and I think my&s;elf <HI>enjoined</HI> to an <HI>explanation</HI> of the account I have given, le&s;t the publick &s;hould imagine that I have any way <HI>mi&s;led</HI> a &s;ociety, which has for a long time been one of the principal ornaments of this nation.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>Previous to any con&s;ultation, I propo&s;ed to Dr. Main|waring and Dr. Brown, at their own hou&s;es, the mode of operation which was afterwards pur&s;ued: And I mu&s;t here do them the ju&s;tice to declare, that I verily be|lieve it never would have taken place, if they had not &s;econded me in my propo&s;al. Mr. Burchall was for am|putation. It was he that principally made the objec|tions mentioned in the Tran&s;action; and though my me|thod was agreed upon, he declared both before, during the time of, and for &s;ome weeks after the operation, that he was very apprehen&s;ive it could never an&s;wer. The patient was Mr. Burchall's. He made the inci&s;ion in the place which I had pointed out. <HI>I brought out one of the ends of the bone,</HI> which he attempted to &s;aw off, but he&s;itated upon finding it to be attended with &s;ome difficulty, the inci&s;ion having been made too &s;mall. Upon this, I cut off the end with the forceps, replaced it, and brought out the other end, which I al&s;o cut off. The dre&s;&s;ings and bandage were applied by Mr. Bur|chall. It was I that contrived the fracture-box; and the fir&s;t being made too large, a &s;econd, which was made under my direction, was u&s;ed as long as the patient was confined to his bed. I very frequently attended at the dre&s;&s;ings; for though the patient did not fall under my immediate care, I was anxious for the &s;ucce&s;s of my propo&s;al, and knew that if it did not <HI>&s;ucceed,</HI> I was to bear the blame, as the inventor of the operation.</P>
<P>For the truth of the&s;e particulars I appeal to every di&s;intere&s;ted gentleman pre&s;ent at the con&s;ultation and operation, and (if I have repre&s;ented any thing wrong) I publickly call upon them to a denial of any of the facts I have related.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT the publick may be better able to judge of the di&s;pute betwixt Mr. Charles White and my&s;elf, concerning the invention, method of ope|ration, and cure, performed on the arm of Robert El|liott,
<PB N="14" REF="13">late a patient of mine in the Infirmary at Man|che&s;ter; I think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end you the following hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e, which I hope you will be kind enough to publi&s;h in your next evening paper, with my ob&s;ervations and remarks on Mr. Charles White's di&s;in|genuous Letter, publi&s;hed in your Chronicle of the 25th of September la&s;t. About the latter end of the year 1759, I received a letter from John Wright, E&s;q; of Eyam, in Derby&s;hire, acquainting me with the unhappy circum&s;tance of a poor boy, in the &s;aid town, who had the misfortune to break his arm &s;everal months before (which, notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours that had been u&s;ed to unite the bone, &s;till remained as loo&s;e as on the fir&s;t day of the accident) and de&s;iring my opinion, that, if I thought any thing could be done to &s;ave his arm, he &s;hould be glad to &s;end him to Manche&s;ter to be ad|mitted under my care in the Infirmary; in an&s;wer to which, I told his &s;on-in-law, Mr. A&s;hwood, who then lived here, in what manner I thought his arm might be cured, but that, till I &s;aw the boy, I could not &s;o pro|perly judge of it; accordingly he was brought to Man|che&s;ter on the 23d of December, 1759, and the &s;ame evening I examined his arm at Mr. A&s;hwood's, when I gave my opinion that it might be cured without ampu|tation. The day following he was admitted my patient in the Infirmary, where I again examined his arm, and called on the gentlemen then pre&s;ent to do the &s;ame, who gave their opinions for amputation only; to this I did not a&s;&s;ent, and the boy's ma&s;ter &s;trongly remon&s;trated again&s;t it, &s;aying, he could have had that done at home, and de&s;ired I would try all po&s;&s;ible means, rather than cut it off; upon which I told him to leave the boy, and I would con&s;ider further of the method I had before pro|po&s;ed, which was the &s;ame that was afterwards put in execution; to corroborate the truth of which, I beg leave to appeal to two certificates, of which I have given copies at the end of this letter, which are dated the 21&s;t of October in&s;tant, and are &s;igned by John Wright, E&s;q; and the &s;aid Mr. Thomas A&s;hwood. Whether or no Mr. White might have heard of my de&s;ign I cannot po&s;i|tively determine, but I am the more inclined to believe that was the ca&s;e, from his a&s;king, upon fir&s;t &s;eeing the
<PB N="15" REF="14">boy, which was the day after his admi&s;&s;ion, what method had been propo&s;ed for his relief; on being told none bat amputation, only that I had &s;aid I would take him in and con&s;ider of it; he, upon examining the arm a little, immediately replied, that he thought there was a method by which it might be &s;aved without amputation, and then de&s;cribed the method which I had before &s;poke of to Mr. A&s;hwood, which was afterwards pur&s;ued. Mr. White, in his account publi&s;hed in the 51&s;t volume of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, allows the operation to be performed by a gentleman of great abilities in his profe&s;&s;ion, but at the fame time a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the &s;ole merit of the invention, and mode of operation; and, in his letter of the 25th ult. in an explanation (as he calls it) of his former account, he not only lays claim to the invention, but likewi&s;e to the operation and cure, by telling you that I was for amputation, and that <Q>"I principally made the objections mentioned in the Tran&s;actions;"</Q> that I was not for amputation, I think I have &s;ufficiently proved, be&s;ides, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that could only be the dernier re&s;ource. The only objec|tion which I made was that of lacerating the humeral artery, by forcing out the ends of the bone, and, as I was to perform the operation, the &s;tarting any objection at the con&s;ultation could not be con&s;trued otherwi&s;e than a de&s;ire to have their opinions on &s;uch operations. He further a&s;&s;erts, that though his method was agreed on, <Q>"I declared, both before, during the time, and for &s;ome weeks after the operation, that I was apprehen|&s;ive it would never an&s;wer;"</Q> in contradiction to this, I can prove, that I frequently declared it was the only method, both before and after the operation was con|cluded on, and the method I had propo&s;ed on the re|ceipt of Mr. Wright's letter. He next &s;ays, <Q>"I made the inci&s;ion in the place he had pointed out;"</Q> Pray what occa&s;ion for his pointing out? when, &s;everal days before the operation, he cannot but remember, that as I was &s;hewing a young gentleman where I intended to make the inci&s;ion, upon his coming into the room I re|peated the &s;ame to him. He then &s;ays, <Q>"he brought out one of the ends of the bone, which I attempted to &s;aw off, but he&s;itated, upon finding it to be at|tended
<PB N="16" REF="15">with &s;ome difficulty, the inci&s;ion having been made too &s;mall;"</Q> I allow that he turned out one of the ends of the bone, but not both, as he hath a&s;&s;erted; that upon my attempting to &s;aw off one end, which was his propo&s;al, on finding it impracticable, I immediately called for the cutting forceps, which he very officiou&s;ly laid hold of, and cut off a &s;mall portion of the bone; I then took the forceps from him, and cut off &s;ome more from that end, and afterwards cut off the other end, &amp;c. As the inci&s;ion was found large enough to an&s;wer my intention in performing the operation, and was not then or afterwards enlarged, how comes he now to &s;ay, it was too &s;mall? Upon opening the arm I propo&s;ed its being placed in a fracture-box, which I thought nece&s;&s;ary, for the more immediate conveniency of dre&s;&s;ing, &amp;c. and Mr. White, with his u&s;ual offici|ou&s;ne&s;s (whil&s;t I was otherwi&s;e employ'd) &s;aid, on his going out of the room, if I plea&s;ed, he would give orders for one: I thinking this a matter of &s;mall con|&s;equence, told him he might; accordingly one was brought, which proving con&s;iderably too large, a &s;econd was made le&s;s, and that not an&s;wering the purpo&s;e &s;o well as I could wi&s;h, was altered by my direction, and u&s;ed as long as I thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, I think it appears clearly, that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Mr. White boa&s;ts to have given in the operation, was an act of over-officiou&s;ne&s;s, as the patient was mine, and under my directions. It would be tedious to analize the whole of his letter, and I &s;hould not have mentioned the&s;e particulars, but to &s;hew that the manner of repre&s;enting facts is very different, for different purpo&s;es: I mu&s;t remark, that if Mr. White's opinion of my abilities, or his e&s;teem of me as a man of honour and knowledge in my profe&s;&s;ion, was con&s;i&s;tent with his declarations, that he would have conferred with me upon, or at lea&s;t have informed me of his de|&s;ign of communicating that remarkable operation; in which ca&s;e, if I had acquie&s;ced in his relation, he would have been ju&s;tly entitled to the merit he has a&s;&s;umed; but as he did not, I, &s;urely, cannot be condemned in &s;aying, that be has been endeavouring to rai&s;e a charac|ter and reputation to him&s;elf, on account of that ope|rations,

<P>I WAS pre&s;ent when Robert Elliott was admitted into the Infirmary, and remember that amputation was the only method propo&s;ed by the gentlemen there, ex|cept Mr. Burchall, who &s;aid he could propo&s;e a method to &s;ave the arm, which he had before told me of more than once at my hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A Particular Narrative, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Publick di&s;pute is a ta&s;k of &s;o di&s;|agreeable a nature, that nothing but the vindication of my character from the unde&s;erved a&s;&s;aults it has received, could have induced me to appear in the light of a paper warriour.</P>
<P>When an invention has been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, it has been no uncommon thing to &s;ee others attempting to bear away the honour from it's author. But in the ca&s;e of Robert Elliot, Mr. Bur|chall did not only defer his claim till the &s;ucce&s;s of the method propo&s;ed was evi|dent, but even till the operation had, by repeated publications, received the ap|probation of the publick. The follow|ing narrative will make it evident, that I have done every thing I could, con&s;i&s;t|ently
<PB N="2" REF="18">with truth, to prevent a quarrel. That the propo&s;al of the mode pur&s;ued was entirely my own, and that no one particular has been by me injuriou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented. Mr. Burchall him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, that I performed a part, and that a principal part too, of the opera|tion, by bringing out, and cutting off, that end of the bone which was fir&s;t at|tempted. Had I performed even the whole, I &s;hould not have a&s;&s;umed to my&s;elf any merit upon that account; the practi&s;e was &s;o ea&s;y after the method had been laid down, that any Pupil might have readily &s;ucceeded. I have frequent|ly &s;een Mr. Burchall &s;ucce&s;sfully perform much more difficult operations, and can|not therefore help attributing his he&s;ita|tion in the mid&s;t of this, to his having no good opinion of the contrivance, and to his going about it therefore with a le&s;s degree of confidence than if he him&s;elf had been the inventor.</P>
<P>Mr. Lloyd went to London in the be|ginning of the year 1760; before he &s;et
<PB N="3" REF="19">out upon his journey I had &s;hewn him (in the infirmary) Robert Elliot's arm, and de&s;cribed to him the mode of opera|tion which had been pur&s;ued. Mr. Lloyd was plea&s;ed with the invention; and, af|ter his arrival in town, accidentally men|tioned it, at one of the meetings of the Royal Society, to &s;ome of the members, who begg'd he would write down into the country for a more particular rela|tion. He accordingly wrote to his &s;on, Dr. John Lloyd, to get him an account of the ca&s;e from me; and, as he was then upon the point of leaving London, he de|&s;ired it might be &s;ent by the return of the po&s;t, that he might have an oppor|tunity of &s;hewing it to his friends at the next meeting of the Society.</P>
<P>Dr. John Lloyd called upon me with his father's me&s;&s;age on Sunday the 16th of March, 1760, about noon. I was that day &s;o much engaged, that I could not begin to write out the ca&s;e till eleven o'clock at night, but fini&s;hed it, before I went to bed, from notes which I had
<PB N="4" REF="20">kept by me &s;ince the time of the opera|tion. The doctor came to me for it as &s;oon as I was up the next morning: As I had wrote in ha&s;te, I de&s;ired he would read it over, and correct any grammati|cal mi&s;takes, if any &s;uch had e&s;caped me. It was then dated; he enclo&s;ed it in a letter (which he had brought along with him) to his father; and, as it was near the time of the po&s;t's going out, it was di&s;patched to the office immediately; I had no opportunity of &s;hewing it to any per&s;on out of my own hou&s;e, not even to my father, who was then at home, but three doors from me, and who never &s;aw it (as I had not time to take a copy) till it was honoured with a publi|cation in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions. Mr. Lloyd gave it to Dr. Birch, one of the &s;ecretaries, upon the 20th of March, who read it before the &s;ociety upon the 27th of the &s;ame month, but not till af|ter Mr. Lloyd had left London.</P>
<P>I now mentioned to &s;ome few per&s;ons what had been done, and, among&s;t the
<PB N="5" REF="21">re&s;t, to Mr. Burchall in the &s;urgeon's room in the Infirmary. I did not, however, tell it him in the manner of a&s;king his leave; for I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k any man for liberty to publi&s;h my own inventions. As to my letting him know the ca&s;e would be publi&s;hed, it was not in my power; I did not know it would, till I &s;aw it had received a place in the Tran&s;actions: Every paper carried to the &s;ociety is not favoured with a reading, nor is every reading followed by a publication. In the year 1752 an order, which is &s;till in force, was made, that a committee of the members &s;hould be appointed to re-con&s;ider the papers read before them, and &s;elect out of them &s;uch, as they &s;hould think mo&s;t proper for their future publications. The vo|lume of the Tran&s;actions, which contains the ca&s;e of Robert Elliot was publi&s;hed in May 1761. It was immediately &s;ent down, not only to the Publick Library, but to &s;everal gentlemen in Manche&s;ter, and an ab&s;tract of the ca&s;e was printed
<PB N="6" REF="22">in the Critical Review for the Month of June, and in the Monthly Review for July, and the whole ca&s;e was re-pub|li&s;hed in the Univer&s;al Magazine for the month of July, and in the Briti&s;h Chro|nicle of the 5th of Augu&s;t; yet Mr. Bur|chall never &s;o much as hinted (though I &s;aw him every week in the Infirmary) nor had I any rea&s;on to imagine, that the publication had given him umbrage, till we accidentally met in the pa&s;&s;age lead|ing to the Old Coffee-Hou&s;e in the la&s;t week of Augu&s;t. I then told him, I was extremely &s;orry he had taken any thing I had done ami&s;s, but that I thought I had mentioned him with as much re&s;pect as po&s;&s;ible. He reply'd, his name was no where mentioned. I an&s;wered, if I had either &s;een him to have a&s;ked his leave, or had known that the mention of his name would have been agree|able, I &s;hould willingly have in&s;erted it. I repre&s;ented the ha&s;ty manner in which the paper went out of my hands, that the omi&s;&s;ion of his name was only owing to
<PB N="7" REF="23">my over caution not to di&s;oblige; that I had given away the merit of the opera|tion from my&s;elf, and was de&s;irous he &s;hould retain it; that the ca&s;e was gene|rally known in Manche&s;ter, and that I had taken every opportunity, wherever I had heard it mentioned, of declaring him to be the operator. He then a&s;ked me, if I was willing to do the &s;ame in any of the publick papers? I told him, I was willing to do it in any, in which the ca&s;e had appeared. He &s;aid, he &s;hould be &s;atisfied, if I would do it in Lloyd's Evening Chronicle; de&s;ired that I would draw up a paper in a proper form for in|&s;ertion, and told me, he would call upon me for it, to &s;end it to the Printer: Im|mediately, upon leaving him, I wrote what follows.</P>

<P>About three days afterwards I acci|dentally met him in the Smithy-Door<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Street in Manche&s;ter.</NOTE>;
<PB N="9" REF="25">I told him, I had done what he de&s;ired; hoped I had put the paper into &s;uch a form as would be agreeable; had left it upon the de&s;k in my &s;tudy, to be ready when he &s;hould call, and that, whenever he plea&s;ed, he might in&s;ert it according to his propo&s;al. I under&s;tood him that he would call, and left him, as I thought, in perfect friend&s;hip. Notwith&s;tanding this, he never called, never &s;ent any me&s;&s;age, nor made any apology for his omi&s;&s;ion; but, without acquainting me, wrote the letter of the 2d of September; which, along with one &s;ub&s;cribed J.

I mu&s;t here appeal to the publick, whether my behaviour to Mr. Burchall, whom I had been &s;tri|ving to oblige to the utmo&s;t of my power, was &s;uch as merited the return it met with.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this treatment, I was &s;till &s;o aver&s;e to an open rupture, that af|ter I had drawn up my an&s;wer to his and his friend's letter, I de&s;ired Dr. Brown
<PB N="10" REF="26">would &s;hew it to him before I di&s;patched it to the printer.

<P>Dr. Brown &s;hewed my an&s;wer to Mr. Burchall in die Infirmary, and at the &s;ame time told him the publication of it
<PB N="12" REF="28">would be dropt, if it was either agree|able to him to &s;ign the above paper, which I had &s;ent, or any thing el&s;e to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Mr. Burchall made two objections; one was, that it con|tained an accu&s;ation of his friend, and the other, that I had laid claim to the &s;ole invention; for he added, that though I had had the fortune to make the fir&s;t mention of it, yet that he him&s;elf had thought of it as well as I. After this, Dr. Brown told me, that if I would era&s;e the words&mdash;<HI>His Friend, and the &s;ole Inventor,</HI> he was in hopes he could prevail with him to &s;ign the paper, and that he had promi&s;ed to &s;ee him again the next morning. I replied, I &s;hould be glad to comply with anything the Doc|tor thought proper, and made the pro|po&s;ed alterations; but, upon Dr. Brown's offering the paper again to Mr. Burchall, the latter ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ign it.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons why I gave Dr. Brown this trouble were the&s;e; I knew he was per|fectly agreeable to Mr. Burchall; that he
<PB N="13" REF="29">was thoroughly acquainted with the ca&s;e upon his own knowledge; and that, from his known humanity, I did not doubt but he would do his utmo&s;t to bring about a reconciliation.</P>
<P>Upon Mr. Burchall's <HI>refu&s;al,</HI> my an&s;wer was publi&s;hed in the Briti&s;h Chro|nicle of the 25th of September, 1761. On its arrival at Manche&s;ter, I was <HI>&s;harply attacked</HI> by him at the weekly board of the Infirmary, and there pub|lickly charged with having a&s;&s;erted <HI>fal|&s;ities.</HI> I told him, I was certain I had <HI>&s;trictly adhered to truth,</HI> but that, if he thought otherwi&s;e, I was willing to abide by the following propo&s;al.</P>
<P>That <HI>he</HI> and <HI>I</HI> &s;hould join in a peti|tion to all the gentlemen pre&s;ent at the con&s;ultation and operation, to de&s;ire <HI>them to depo&s;e,</HI> before a <HI>magi&s;trate,</HI> whatever they knew concerning the affair; that if he would con&s;ent to this, the depo&s;itions &s;hould be put into <HI>his own hands,</HI> he &s;hould be at <HI>liberty</HI> to <HI>publi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>&s;uppre&s;s</HI> them, as he thought mo&s;t conducive to his own
<PB N="14" REF="30">intere&s;t, and that this &s;hould <HI>terminate</HI> the di&s;pute betwixt us. I repeated this propo&s;al to him three <HI>&s;everal times</HI> before the board, but he did not accept my of|fer. There does but one rea&s;on occur to me why Mr. Burchall &s;hould decline this offer, the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, both at the con&s;ultation and operation, are gentlemen of probity, and I have good rea&s;on to believe would at that time have complied with our reque&s;t, if Mr. Burchall had ac|cepted of my propo&s;al, as they all of them &s;eemed to &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to re|pair the breach between us.</P>
<P>Mr. Burchall's reply to mine of the 25th of September, dated October 24th, 1761, was publi&s;hed in the Chronicle of the 10th of March, 1762: In it he &s;eems much di&s;po&s;ed to play with words; and, indeed, the whole performance mu&s;t appear of a very extraordinary nature to tho&s;e, who, by their attendance at the Infirmary, can be the only evidences in regard to the ca&s;e, from which the pre|&s;ent di&s;pute has ari&s;en; and, to u&s;e his
<PB N="15" REF="31">own words, mu&s;t have effectually con|vinced them, that <Q><HI>"The manner of repre|&s;enting Facts, is very different for dif|ferent purpo&s;es."</HI></Q></P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>"Whether or no Mr. White might have heard of my de&s;ign, I can|not po&s;itively determine, but I am the more inclined to believe that was the ca&s;e, from his a&s;king, upon fir&s;t &s;ee|ing the lad, which was the day af|ter his admi&s;&s;ion, what method had been propo&s;ed for his relief, &amp;c."</Q> an inference as ab&s;urd as it is fal&s;e, and &s;uch a one as was perhaps never drawn from &s;uch a que&s;tion! He goes on with pretty round a&s;&s;ertions, and appeals, for the truth of them, to two certificates, which by no means come up to the point in di&s;|pute: The fir&s;t is from Mr. Wright, of Eyam, containing no more than a remembrance of what he had heard from Mr. Edmund Mar&s;den; but as Mr. Mar&s;den has favoured me with his own evidence, this te&s;timony of Mr. Wright's will, I imagine, be e&s;teemed of little
<PB N="16" REF="32">con&s;equence. The &s;econd is from Mr. A&s;hwood, who recollects that amputa|tion was the only method propo&s;ed by any of the gentlemen of the Infirmary, except by Mr. Burchall, who &s;aid, he could propo&s;e a method to &s;ave the arm. The minutes of the board will te&s;tify I did not attend it upon the day Mr. A&s;h|wood mentions, and therefore he cannot include me among&s;t the number of tho&s;e who were for amputation; and I &s;hall be able to prove, that if Mr. Burchall did not propo&s;e amputation in Mr. A&s;hwood's hearing, he did it, however, at another time. Mr. A&s;hwood does not &s;ay what was Mr. Burchall's method; and cer|tainly, if he ever had any method except amputation to propo&s;e, he mu&s;t him&s;elf, upon reflection, have been convinced of its in&s;ufficiency; el&s;e why did not he mention it to the boy's ma&s;ter, Mr. Mar&s;|den, when he was pre&s;&s;ed to think of &s;ome method to &s;ave the arm, and told, that if it had been imagined amputation mu&s;t have taken place, the operation
<PB N="17" REF="33">might have been performed without the trouble of &s;o long a journey? Why did not he propo&s;e it to &s;ome of the faculty, rather than to Mr. A&s;hwood, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a competent judge in &s;urgical ca&s;es? Why did not he pro|po&s;e it at the con&s;ultation held in the In|firmary upon the Thur&s;day after the boy's admi&s;&s;ion? (the only one in reality held upon this occa&s;ion:) there it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The printed rules and orders of the Publick In|firmary at Manche&s;ter enjoin,

<PB N="18" REF="34">A&s;hwood, that Mr. Burchall ever pro|po&s;ed any other method.</P>
<P>What danger might be apprehended from the operation I cannot pretend to &s;ay; I was always clear in my opinion, and often a&s;&s;erted, that if the plan which I had laid down was &s;trictly adhered to, there was no more danger to be feared from this, than from any other capital operation in &s;urgery.</P>
<P>In my letter of the 18 th of September, 1761, it is &s;aid, that I brought out one of the ends of the bone, which he (Mr. Burchall) attempted to &s;aw off, but he&s;itated upon finding it to be attended with &s;ome difficulty, the inci&s;ion having been made too &s;mall. The following is Mr. Burchall's remark, <Q>"As the inci|&s;ion was found large enough to an&s;wer my intention in performing the opera|tion, and was not then, or afterwards, enlarged, how comes he now to &s;ay it was too &s;mall?"</Q></P>
<P>When I a&s;&s;erted that the inci&s;ion had been made too &s;mall, I did not do it in
<PB N="19" REF="35">order to throw dirt; for I &s;hould be &s;orry to have &s;aid any thing in this di&s;pute, to which the ca&s;e did not nece&s;&s;arily lead me; I thought my meaning had been &s;ufficiently clear, but, as it does not &s;eem to have been under&s;tood by Mr. Burchall, I &s;hall endeavour to explain my&s;elf in a more ample manner.</P>
<P>My meaning was, that if the inci&s;ion had been made larger, Mr. Burchall would have had no occa&s;ion to have he&s;itated when he attempted to &s;aw off the end of the bone; and here he allows (though he denies me the re&s;t of the invention) that the propo&s;al for <HI>&s;awing</HI> off the end was my own, <HI>apparently</HI> becau&s;e this <HI>propo&s;al</HI> did not meet with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>To law off the end of a bone is no new practice in compound fractures; it has been performed by others as well as by my&s;elf; and I believe it will be al|lowed by every intelligent &s;urgeon, that the &s;aw, where it can be u&s;ed, is for many, and very obvious rea&s;ons, &s;uperior to any other in&s;trument.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="36">
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;engenuous letter &mdash; officiou&s;ly &mdash; u&s;ual officion&s;|ne&s;s &mdash; boa&s;ts &mdash; rai&s;ing a character, &amp;c.</NOTE> warmth of &s;ome of the expre&s;|&s;ions made u&s;e of by Mr. Burchall, in his la&s;t letter, will not, I hope, ever tempt me to retaliation.</P>
<P>I have, in a great mea&s;ure, confined my&s;elf to facts; and, as Mr. Burchall has friends in the Infirmary, if I have mi&s;repre&s;ented any thing, there can be no doubt made but I &s;hall be &s;ufficiently refuted.</P>
<P>In the beginning of October 1761, Mr. Bent, who re&s;ides in the Infirmary, gave Mr. Burchall and me each of us a copy of his account, with leave to publi&s;h it; Mr. Burchall a&s;ked Mr. Bent for liberty to print a part of it, which Mr. Bent re|fu&s;ed, but again repeated, that he was welcome to publi&s;h the whole.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burchall did not think proper to annex this account to his la&s;t letter, I &s;hall now my&s;elf give it to the publick. Whoever carefully con&s;iders his relation will, I imagine, ea&s;ily perceive what part
<PB N="21" REF="37">of it Mr. Burchall has been plea&s;ed to borrow, and at the &s;ame time too di&s;|cern, that he has wre&s;ted the facts he has thought proper to give in &s;uch a manner as to make them &s;uitable to his purpo&s;e. I am the more induced to believe that this was the real ca&s;e, becau&s;e Mr. Bur|chall him&s;elf told me, he had not kept any minutes of the affair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is it not therefore probable this ca&s;e would have been lo&s;t to the publick, if I had not committed it to paper?</NOTE>. Mr. Bent confirms many things I have advanced, and does not contradict me in a &s;ingle ar|ticle. He &s;ays, indeed, that Mr. Bur|chall one morning marked out the place he thought the mo&s;t eligible for the inci|&s;ion, but at the &s;ame time tells you, that this was in the interim betwixt the con|&s;ultation and operation. I had propo&s;ed the mode, and pointed out the place, at the con&s;ultation held upon the Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>Mr. Burchall, though he was &s;en&s;ible at the &s;ame time there was no other method of &s;aving the limb, did not come into my &s;cheme till &s;ome days after: it
<PB N="22" REF="38">was upon his giving his con&s;ent that he marked out the place, agreeable to Mr. Bent's relation, and, upon my coming into the room, he apply'd to me (if I under&s;tood his meaning) to know if we agreed in regard to the inci&s;ion, to which he received my an&s;wer in the affirmative. Mr. Bent &s;ays that, <Q>"Mr. White took the forceps and cut off the end, that Mr. Burchall took the forceps out of his hands, either to cut off the other, or to cut off more from that which was cut, but cannot po&s;&s;ibly deter|mine which."</Q></P>
<P>Upon my a&s;king Mr. Bent very parti|cularly to recollect what he could, re|lating to the cutting off the extremities of the broken bone, he told me, he per|fectly well remembered, that the fir&s;t end was taken off by my&s;elf, but that he could not po&s;&s;ibly recollect who it was that amputated the &s;econd; that he re|membered Mr. Burchall took hold of the forceps, but could not determine with what view he did it, whether it was to
<PB N="23" REF="39">cut off the other end, or to take &s;ome|thing more from one of tho&s;e upon which I had performed the operation. But I mu&s;t here again repeat it; I don't pre|tend to any merit from an operation which is not a difficult one, and therefore I &s;hall not produce any more evidences upon that head. I only mention the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances to &s;hew that Mr. Bent has no where contradicted any thing I have a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Mar&s;den does not po&s;i|tively &s;ay Mr. Burchall declared for amputation, yet he affirms, that Mr. Burchall &s;aid, <HI>He did not know what could be done;</HI> and, when amputation was men|tioned, made <HI>no objection</HI> to <HI>the operation.</HI> Mr. Burchall, though he was pre&s;&s;ed to think of &s;ome other method, gave him no encouragement to hope for more fa|vourable treatment, and had he had any other method to propo&s;e, is it not to be imagined that common humanity would have prompted him, either to have de|clared his method before Mr. Mar&s;den
<PB N="24" REF="40">had left the town, or at lea&s;t to have given him rea&s;on to expect the pro&s;ecu|tion of a milder practice.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now detain my reader by any more of my own remarks, but &s;hall lay before him the evidences I have to produce, and leave him to judge not only who has the be&s;t right to the inven|tion, but who has taken mo&s;t pains to pre&s;erve that amity which I could hearti|ly have wi&s;hed to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and which ought always to be maintained be|tween gentlemen of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P><Q><HI>"Being de&s;ired by Mr. Burchall and Mr. White to give an account of the particulars I remembered relating to the ca&s;e of Robert Elliott, I have wrote the following with the greate&s;t impartiality and &s;tricte&s;t truth, ac|cording to the be&s;t of my remembrance."</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>"I Remember that on December 24th, 1759 (the day of Robert Elliott's admi&s;&s;ion into the Infirmary) that Mr. White was not there, and that Mr. Burchall de&s;ired Dr. Brown (who was then taking in for Dr. Kay, he being at that time ill of a fever) and Mr. Hall to &s;ee the boy; and I don't re|member that I heard any method pro|po&s;ed, be&s;ides amputation, but that Mr. Burchall &s;aid, he would take the boy in for a week or two, in order to call a con&s;ultation, and &s;ee if there might not be &s;ome other method pro|po&s;ed. That Mr. White came the next morning; and, being &s;hewed the
<PB N="26" REF="42">patient, he a&s;ked what method had been propo&s;ed? I an&s;wered, I had not heard any, except amputation; and that, after examining the parts a lit|tle, he &s;aid, he thought there was a method by which the boy might be relieved without cutting off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> arm, and accordingly de&s;cribed that which was afterwards pur&s;ued, and de&s;ired it might be told Mr. Burchall, which was accordingly done. I don't re|member exactly the an&s;wer Mr. Bur|chall made upon his fir&s;t being told this; but I well remember him often repeating, that there could be no other method for &s;aving the limb, but that he had an objection which he thought of great weight again&s;t it, viz. the danger of lacerating the ar|tery, by turning out the ends of the bone. The con&s;ultation, I think, was held about a week before the operation was performed, but don't remember any thing particularly that
<PB N="27" REF="43">was there &s;aid or propo&s;ed: I remem|ber in the interim betwixt the con&s;ul|tation and operation, that one morning Mr. Burchall marked out the place he thought mo&s;t eligible to make the in|ci&s;ion in, by pointing with his finger upon the lower edge of the deltoid mu&s;cle, on the external part of the humerus to me, and that Mr. White coming into the room immediately after, he repeated the &s;ame to him, who an&s;wered in the affirmative, that that mu&s;t be the place. I don't re|member the particular parts performed by either gentlemen in the operation, but that Mr. Burchall made the in|ci&s;ion, and attempted to &s;aw off one end of the bone, but made a &s;tand, upon finding it impracticable, in which interim Mr. White took the forceps, and cut off the end; that Mr. Bur|chall took the forceps out of his hands, either to cut off the other, or to try to cut off more from that which
<PB N="28" REF="44">was cut, but cannot po&s;&s;ibly deter|mine which. Mr. Burchall was the per&s;on who had the chief manage|ment of the patient; Mr. White fre|quently attended the dre&s;&s;ings; and one morning I remember Mr. Burchall mentioned the placing the arm in a fracture-box in a direct line, but Mr. White thinking the ends of the bone did not come &s;o well into contact in a &s;treight line, as when the cubitus lay at a right angle with the humerus, &s;aid, he could contrive one in which it might lie in that po&s;ition, and ac|cordingly gave orders for the joiner to be &s;ent to his hou&s;e, which was done, and a box brought the next morning, which proved greatly too large, upon which he ordered a &s;econd, which was likewi&s;e obliged to be altered, the board that went on the in&s;ide of the arm, from the &s;houlder to the elbow, being made too long, and with two hinges, one of which being took off
<PB N="29" REF="45">and the board cut &s;horter, the &s;ame was u&s;ed as long as the patient was confined to his bed. As witne&s;s my hand,"</Q></P>

<P><Q>"IN December 1759, being an ap|prentice to Mr. White, I attended at the Infirmary in Manche&s;ter at a con&s;ultation held upon the ca&s;e of Robert Elliott, the Thur&s;day a&s;ter his admi&s;&s;ion into the Infirmary, where Dr. Brown, Mr. Burchall, and Mr. White, were pre&s;ent. As the boy was a patient under Mr. Burchall's care, he &s;hewed him to the other gen|tlemen, and told them what he knew concerning the accident; and, at the &s;ame time, gave it as his opinion (to the be&s;t of my recollection) that no|thing but amputation could be of &s;er|vice, or words to that effect. Mr. White, upon examining the arm, pro|po&s;ed that mode of operation which was afterwards pur&s;ued. Some ob|jections being &s;tarted, Mr. White re|plied, that if the plan he propo&s;ed did not &s;ucceed, amputation might be had recour&s;e to at the la&s;t.

<P>Mr. Poole, the apothecary to the In|firmary, has often &s;aid, the boy owed the pre&s;ervation of his arm to me. I imagine the principal facts I have ad|vanced have been very &s;ufficiently proved by the evidences I have produced; and I hope the rea&s;ons I have given why I did not &s;hew the paper to Mr. Burchall pre|vious to its publication, as well as why I omitted the mention of his name, will
<PB N="33" REF="49">be e&s;teemed &s;atisfactory: But if any of my readers &s;hould be of a different opi|nion, I de&s;ire they will do me the ju&s;tice to remember, that &s;o &s;oon as Mr. Bur|chall made any remon&s;trances to me, I readily offered to &s;et the affair in a clear light, either in the Briti&s;h Chronicle, or in any other paper in which the ca&s;e had appeared. This was certainly doing as much as man could do; and he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at my propo&s;al. Yet, in a few days after this, he wrote the letter printed in the Briti&s;h Chronicle of the 7th of September, 1761, without &s;o much as mentioning to me that he had altered his opinion. I appeal to the pub|lick whether this was genteel treatment. If the paper I had drawn up had not been &s;atisfactory to him, I &s;hould willingly have altered it, as far as a &s;trict adherence to truth would have allowed me.</P>
<P>I had an opportunity of &s;eeing Robert Elliott, and of examining his arm, about Michaelmas la&s;t. His ma&s;ter informed me, that after his di&s;charge from the In|firmary,
<PB N="34" REF="50">in May 1760, he went to work as u&s;ual; that he kept well the remainder of the year; but that, in the beginning of 1761, he had the misfortune, by a fall, to break his arm again at, or near, the place of the former fracture; a callus formed, and the lad returned to his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hortly after; but (for want of a due ob&s;ervance of the &s;urgeon's di|rections) the boy being of a re&s;tle&s;s play|ful di&s;po&s;ition, the arm became crooked, and con&s;equently &s;horter than the other. I have only related this circum&s;tance, that I may not be accu&s;ed of concealing any thing from the publick relative to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant of the arts, which &s;ome low emi&s;&s;aries have made u&s;e of, to depreciate me among&s;t my friends, of the threats which have been thrown out to deter me from publi&s;hing my defence, nor of the methods which have been made u&s;e of to prevent my getting evi|dence, in order to clear my&s;elf, and main|tain
<PB N="35" REF="51">my right to the invention: Such ar|tifices I de&s;pi&s;e! and &s;uch menaces I defy!</P>
<P>A conte&s;t of this nature no way tends to the advantage of mankind, nor is the publick intere&s;ted in the event. The profe&s;&s;ion hath but too often &s;uffered by differences made publick, whil&s;t the &s;elf-intere&s;ted combatants have only afforded &s;ubject for the entertainment and ridicule of the &s;tanders-by. In ca&s;es like this, an Apology to the Publick is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but my pardon I hope I &s;hall be able to obtain, as it mu&s;t be evident from this Narrative, I have done every thing in my power to prevent an open rupture.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e beg leave to make an apology to tho&s;e gentlemen who&s;e names I have taken the liberty of making pub|lick, as no other means were left me of &s;etting matters in a proper light.</P>
