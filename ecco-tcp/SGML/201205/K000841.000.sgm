<P>The &s;erum, coagulable lymph, and &s;uperfluous wa|ter, are diffu&s;ed through one another; and the red part is mechanically mixed with them. Some of the extraneous &s;ub&s;tances are al&s;o mechanically mixed with them, and &s;ome diffu&s;ed through them.</P>

<HEAD>PROPERTIES of the SERUM.</HEAD>
<P>IT is fluid in any degree of heat between 30 and 160 of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</P>
<P>In a le&s;&s;er heat it freezes, in a greater it coagu|lates.</P>
<P>Coagulation is a &s;eparation of an animal or vege|table matter from the water in which it was di&s;&s;olved; and is at the &s;ame time a change of the properties of that matter, rendering it in&s;oluble in water again by commixture alone.</P>
<P>The &s;erum con&s;i&s;ts chemically of a coagulable mat|ter, and water in which common &s;al ammoniac and pho&s;phoric ammoniac, and generally common &s;alt, and frequently &s;elenites, and fixed ammoniac, are di&s;|&s;olved; but it is a que&s;tion, whether the water che|mically combined in the &s;erum is al&s;o united with tho&s;e neutral &s;alts, or whether the &s;erum, and the &s;olution of the&s;e, are only diffu&s;ed through one another.</P>
<P>It is probably in it&s;elf colourle&s;s, and inodorous; but it receives a yellowi&s;h or browni&s;h hue from the putre&s;cent part of the blood, and acquires a &s;mell from the e&s;&s;ential oil.</P>
<P>If it contained no neutral &s;alts, it would be in&s;ipid, and incapable of &s;timulating.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<P>The &s;uperfluous water may be &s;eparated from it by filtration in the body, but that which is chemi|cally combined with the other parts cannot.</P>
<P>All the water may be evaporated from it by a le&s;&s;er heat than 140 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, if it be expo&s;ed to the air. The other parts remain after this operation &s;olid, and &s;oluble again in water by commixture alone.</P>
<P>The &s;eparation or addition of &s;uperfluous water does not affect its vi&s;cidity, &s;o far as that is of any con&s;equence in the circulation; but the &s;eparation of that water which is in chemical combination, may render it more vi&s;cid.</P>
<P>The water in chemical combination is never &s;e|parated, while the &s;erum is contained in the blood-ve&s;&s;els; and of con&s;equence this part of the blood is always equally vi&s;cid, &s;o far as its vi&s;cidity can affect the circulation or &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>It may be coagulated by acids, oils, alcohol, &amp;c. but no &s;ub&s;tance can get into the blood-ve&s;&s;els in a &s;ufficient degree of concentration to coagulate it, ex|cepting by injection.</P>
<P>It may be coagulated by a juice &s;ecreted in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>It has &s;eldom, if ever, been found coagulated in the body.</P>
<P>The only perceptible difference which has ap|peared in the coagulable part of the &s;erum, from any ob&s;ervation hitherto made public, is, that &s;ometimes in coagulating its parts&punc; adhere more or le&s;s firmly, and that &s;ometimes it is of a deeper or lighter brown colour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<HEAD>PROPERTIES of the COAGULABLE LYMPH.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a compound of water and a coagulable matter.</P>
<P>As long as it continues in the cour&s;e of circulation, it is fluid in any degree of heat between 30 and 120 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</P>
<P>When it is taken out of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, it coagu|lates; whether it be in motion or at re&s;t, expo&s;ed to the air or not, or in the heat of the human body, or in any other degree of heat.</P>
<P>If it be retained in a blood-ve&s;&s;el, it continues fluid for more than three hours in any degree of heat be|tween 30 and 120 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and that whether it be in motion or at re&s;t. The &s;maller the blood-ve&s;&s;el, the longer it continues fluid.</P>
<P>It has hardly ever been found coagulated in the blood-ve&s;&s;els of a living animal, unle&s;s they have been enlarged into aneuri&s;ms or varices.</P>
<P>It has generally been found coagulated in the large ve&s;&s;els of the human body on di&s;&s;ection, and &s;ome|times &s;eparated from the other parts; but to all ap|pearance the&s;e coagulations have almo&s;t always taken place after death.</P>
<P>When it is taken out of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, it may be prevented from coagulating, by &s;aturating the whole blood with common, &s;ea-&s;alt, and perhaps by &s;ome of the other neutral &s;alts.</P>
<P>Although the coagulable part of the &s;erum and coagulable lymph have different properties, the co|agulum formed from both is pretty nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="7">
<P>The coagulum may be di&s;&s;olved in water by boiling or putrefaction; and may be united with concen|trated acids, with cau&s;tic alkalis, and calcarious earth, and with &s;ome metallic &s;alts, into a &s;ub&s;tance &s;oluble in water: but none of the&s;e can get into the &s;y&s;tem by ab&s;orption, &s;o as to produce this effect.</P>
<P>Both the &s;uperfluous water and &s;erum are capable of being &s;eparated from the coagulable lymph, by fil|tration in the body.</P>
<P>When the blood is received into a proper ve&s;&s;el, the coagulation of this part gives an appearance of &s;olidity to the whole: but &s;oon after the whole be|comes thus apparently &s;olid, part of the &s;erum, of the &s;uperfluous water, and of the water which was com|bined with the coagulable lymph, ouzes out from the whole ma&s;s, and brings along with it part of any extraneous fluid that may be contained in the blood-ve&s;&s;els; leaving behind what is commonly called the red globules, the coagulum of the coagulable lymph, and any &s;olid particles that may have been in the blood. This is called the &s;pontaneous &s;eparation.</P>
<P>When the arteries are acting &s;trongly, whether the whole habit be &s;trong or not, the coagulable lymph is more fluid, and longer in coagulating. Of con&s;equence it lets the red particles, which are the heavie&s;t part of the blood, fall down towards the bot|tom, before it coagulates: and upon the &s;pontaneous &s;eparation, the coagulum is divided into two parts; the upper, con&s;i&s;ting of the coagulum of the co|agulable lymph alone (which has in this ca&s;e been called the buff); the under, con&s;i&s;ting partly of this, and partly of the red particles.</P>
<P>Although part of the coagulable lymph would &s;eparate from the red particles, may be prevented by taking the blood from a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, or from a &s;mall
<PB N="6" REF="8">orifice, or by letting it run along the &s;kin before it falls into the ve&s;&s;el into which it is received, or by re|ceiving it into a ve&s;&s;el who&s;e &s;urface is large in pro|portion to its contents; as in all the&s;e ca&s;es the co|agulation is forwarded. On the other hand, if it &s;tagnate in the blood-ve&s;&s;el for &s;ome time before it is taken out, there will be a &s;eparation, when none would otherwi&s;e have happened.</P>
<P>Whether the coagulable lymph &s;eparates in part from the red particles, or not, it coagulates &s;ometimes into a firmer, &s;ometimes into a loo&s;er ma&s;s, generally in proportion to the &s;trength of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>All the &s;ub&s;tances which coagulate the &s;erum, have the &s;ame effect on the coagulable lymph; but none can be applied to it in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, excepting by injection in a &s;ufficient degree of concentration to coagulate it.</P>
<P>The coagulable lymph is probably in it&s;elf colour|le&s;s, in&s;ipid, inodorous, and incapable of &s;timulating.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t it remains in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, it is che|mically combined with a certain proportion of water, from which it cannot be &s;eparated but by coagulation; neither will it combine with a larger proportion.</P>
<P>Water mechanically mixed with it has no effect on its vi&s;cidity, &s;o far as that affects the circulation or &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>No other differences be&s;ides tho&s;e already taken notice of are ob&s;ervable in its properties.</P>
<P>The coagulable lymph and &s;erum are both capable of putrefaction, and are converted by it into a muci|laginous matter, not coagulable by any of the methods recited above.</P>
<P>If this mucilaginous matter &s;hould undergo a fur|ther putrefaction, it emits a foetid vapour, and is con|verted into &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances and calcarious earth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<HEAD>PROPERTIES of the RED PART.</HEAD>
<P>UPON viewing this part of the blood with a deep magnifier in the &s;olar micro&s;cope, as it circulates in the blood-ve&s;&s;els of a living animal, it appears to be divided into a number of &s;mall particles, which are apparently annular, and exceedingly flexible.</P>
<P>While the animal is re&s;piring, and the blood cir|culating, it is of a &s;carlet colour in the arteries, and of a Modena red in the veins; but if the re&s;piration be &s;topped, that blood which circulates afterwards through the lungs continues of a Modena red. If it be taken out of the veins, kept moi&s;t, and expo&s;ed to re&s;pirable air, it becomes of a &s;carlet colour; if it be taken out of the arteries, and covered from the air, or if it &s;tagnate in them, its colour is changed to a Modena red. A light &s;hade of Modena red is not &s;carlet, neither is a deep &s;carlet a Modena red. Va|rious other &s;ub&s;tances alter the colour of this part.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;le, to be inodorous, and void of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>Its &s;pecific gravity is but a very little more than the &s;erum or coagulable lymph.</P>
<P>It is more inflammable than the other parts; and, on performing its chemical analy&s;is, it yields a large proportion of empyreumatic oil.</P>
<P>It is readily &s;oluble in water, but not in the &s;erum.</P>
<P>It is not &s;oluble in a &s;aturated &s;olution of neutral &s;alts.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>It is capable of undergoing the putrefactive fer|mentation, the fir&s;t &s;tage of which breaks it down into &s;maller particles, and renders it of a dark colour. It afterwards is converted into a mucilage, and be|comes &s;oluble in the &s;erum.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The SUPERFLUOUS WATER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is diffu&s;ed through the &s;erum and coagulable lymph.</P>
<P>It contains a part, perhaps the whole, of the &s;alts.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;alts are chemically combined with a part of it only, and this &s;olution is diffu&s;ed through the remaining part.</P>
<P>The water diffu&s;ed may be &s;eparated from the &s;o|lution by filtration in the body.</P>
<P>The &s;olid part of the blood, left after evaporation of the water by a beat le&s;t than that of boiling water, amounts to from one fourth to one fifth of the whole.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>EXTRANEOUS SUBSTANCES.</HEAD>
<P>A Great variety of extraneous &s;ub&s;tances, both fluid and &s;olid, may be introduced into the blood-ve&s;&s;els by ab&s;orption; but none of them in &s;uch pro|portion as to produce any alteration in the blood, ex|cept by fermentation.</P>
<P>When any ferment is introduced into the blood-ve&s;&s;els, it acts upon a part of the blood only; the greate&s;t part remaining to all experiment exactly the &s;ame as before.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="9" REF="11">
<HEAD>Of the PUTREFACTION of the BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>FErmentation is the conver&s;ion of one compound into another, by a new arrangement or manner of combination of its elements.</P>
<P>What is commonly called putrefaction con&s;i&s;ts of two fermentations, which we &s;hall call by the names of the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tage.</P>
<P>All animal &s;olid and fluids may be reduced by the fir&s;t into a mucilaginous ma&s;s, &s;oluble in water, and diffu&s;ible through any quantity of it.</P>
<P>The red part of the blood fir&s;t breaks down into &s;maller particles, before it is formed into a perfect mucilage.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tage takes place without any effer|ve&s;cence.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;tage converts this mucilage into earths, and &s;alts, a foetid vapour, and fixable air.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tage of putrefaction take place in a &s;mall part of the blood, or it is de&s;troyed by &s;ome other operation; for</P>
<P>After having coagulated the &s;erum, if we &s;queeze out the water, and evaporate it, there is left a mu|cilaginous matter &s;imilar to that formed by putre|faction.</P>
<P>The &s;ails formed in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, excepting pho&s;phoric ammoniac, may be formed by the la&s;t &s;tage of putrefaction; and tho&s;e formed by the la&s;t &s;tage are found in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, excepting nitrous &s;elenites, and nitrous ammoniac.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>This mucilage, and the&s;e &s;alts, are always carrying off by urine; the pre&s;ent blood is always dimini&s;hing, and die ve&s;&s;els require a fre&s;h &s;upply from the food.</P>
<P>The blood is always in the mo&s;t powerful cir|cum&s;tances of putrefaction; which are, a heat of 98 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, fluidity, a mo|derate expo&s;ure to air, and motion: but it is pre|vented from petrifying by the action of the ve&s;&s;els; nor can any ferment or other circum&s;tance induce the fermentation, till this action is altered, except per|haps the introduction of chyle intermixed with putrid matter.</P>
<P>In di&s;ea&s;es, the fir&s;t &s;tage often takes place in part of the blood; the &s;econd &s;tage &s;ometimes, although &s;eldom.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="11" REF="13">
<HEAD>Of DIGESTION.</HEAD>
<P>DIGESTION is the conver&s;ion of the food into chyle, and afterwards into blood.</P>
<P>The food may con&s;i&s;t of farinaceous or muci|laginous vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, or native vegetable acid, or &s;ugar, or expre&s;&s;ed oil, or animal &s;olids, or animal fluids containing a mucilaginous matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances may be dige&s;ted, if they be taken &s;ingly, or if they be mixed together.</P>
<P>The blood formed does not differ &s;en&s;ibly in its properties, whether the one or the other of them be u&s;ed &s;ingly, or &s;everal of them together; provided the organs of dige&s;tion be &s;ufficiently powerful convert them into blood.</P>
<P>If the food be &s;olid, it is generally broke down by the teeth, or by &s;ome other apparatus.</P>
<P>But ma&s;hing it down with water is not &s;ufficient to alter its chemical properties, and convert it into chyle and blood.</P>
<P>It is mixed in the &s;tomach with the watery fluids we drink, and with the mucilaginous watery fluids &s;ecreted by the &s;alivary and other glands.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes di&s;&s;olved in water before it is u&s;ed: but it is often rendered &s;olid by a previous prepa|ration, or coagulated by a &s;ub&s;tance &s;ecreted in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Simple &s;olution in water does not convert it into chyle or blood.</P>
<P>If it be previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved in water, it affords le&s;s nouri&s;hment than if exhibited &s;olid.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that it remain in the &s;tomach for &s;ome time, in order to its dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>The only proce&s;s it can go through in the organs of dige&s;tion, that is capable of altering its chemical properties, is fermentation.</P>
<P>Its fermentation is not attended with efferve&s;cence in a healthy &s;tomach.</P>
<P>If vegetable food be u&s;ed, an acid is produced. This acid is de&s;troyed in the duodenum by the bile.</P>
<P>If animal food be u&s;ed alone, no acid is produced.</P>
<P>The &s;tronger the &s;tomach, and the more perfect the dige&s;tion, the le&s;e acid is formed from vegetable food.</P>
<P>No &s;tage of the putrefactive fermentation takes place, during the conver&s;ion of it into chyle and blood, if the dige&s;tion be perfect.</P>
<P>The fermentation which takes place is peculiar to the organs of dige&s;tion, and has never been produced by any artificial means yet attempted.</P>
<P>The fermentation which takes place in the &s;tomach, forwards the &s;olution of &s;olid food in the watery men&s;truums.</P>
<P>Solid foods di&s;&s;olve &s;ooner in the &s;tomach than they can be di&s;&s;olved in water in the &s;ame heat, by any means hitherto found out.</P>
<P>If the &s;tomach does not act properly, &s;olid food remains undi&s;&s;olved; vegetable, and mixtures of ve|getable, and animal &s;ub&s;tances become more acid; animal &s;ub&s;tances putrify; a quantity of air is &s;epa|rated; and the food is not dige&s;ted and converted into chyle.</P>
<P>Only that part of the food which is dige&s;ted affords nouri&s;hment; the nouri&s;hment therefore is in pro|portion to the food and the dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>When food, either from its quantity or quality, cannot be dige&s;ted, it is apt to occa&s;ion great dis|turbances
<PB N="13" REF="15">in the &s;y&s;tem, while it is contained in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>The only &s;en&s;ible alterations produced in the blood by different foods, are in its quantity; or in the pro|portion of &s;uperfluous water; or that &s;ometimes a long u&s;e of animal food brings on a degree of pu|trefaction.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the CHYLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE chyle is formed from the food in the in|te&s;tines, and ab&s;orbed by the lacteals.</P>
<P>The whole fluid ab&s;orbed is not chyle, but a mix|ture of chyle, and the &s;olution of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which were &s;imply di&s;&s;olved in water without being dige&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Quere,</HI> Whether a &s;imple &s;olution of mucilaginous, animal, or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, can be converted into blood, without being formed into chyle in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines?</P>
<P>Chyle is fluid, while in the lacteals; when expo&s;ed to the air, it coagulates; it is rendered white, from a mixture of expre&s;&s;ed oil.</P>
<P>When coagulated, a fluid may be &s;queezed out, which probably contains a coagulable matter, and &s;ugar.</P>

<HEAD>The MATTER of the INSENSIBLE PERSPIRATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;eparated from the &s;urface of the lungs, and from the &s;kin, by evaporation.</P>
<P>The quantity evaporated depends upon the quan|tity of &s;uperfluous water in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, the heat of the air, the quantity of air applied, and the con|traction or relaxation of the ve&s;&s;els from whence the evaporation takes place.</P>

<HEAD>The URINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE urine, in the common &s;tate of the body, is a tran&s;parent browni&s;h fluid, which upon cool|ing has a mucilaginous matter &s;eparated, capable of being redi&s;&s;olved in heat.</P>
<P>In health, the &s;eparating mucilage is generally in &s;uch quantity as to remain &s;u&s;pended in the urine after its reparation, forming what has been called the cloud.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes totally ab&s;ent in health, but much more frequently in di&s;ea&s;es; &s;ometimes it is in quan|tity &s;ufficiently to carry the cloud to the bottom, and form a mucous &s;ediment; and &s;ometimes it falls down in a flaky powder, and forms what bas been called a lateritious &s;ediment, which is commonly of a brick colour, and now and then white.</P>
<P>This la&s;t appearance often takes place on the going off of acute di&s;ea&s;es; but it al&s;o happens in health, and while di&s;ea&s;es &s;ub&s;i&s;t in their full force, parti|cularly when they affect the urinary, pa&s;&s;ages, or parts near them.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;eparating mucilage is &s;eparated in a powder, remains &s;u&s;pended in the urine, and renders it turbid.</P>
<P>After the &s;eparating mucilage is &s;eparated, if the urine be filtrated from it, it is tran&s;parent, con&s;i&s;ting of water which contains a mucilage, and &s;alts.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t,</HI> A mucilage, &s;imilar to that formed by the fir&s;t &s;tage of putrefaction.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="19">
<P>Its quantity varies con&s;iderably; but the proportion of it in the urine is always &s;mall.</P>
<P>If the water be evaporated from it, it will redi&s;&s;olve, and it may be diffu&s;ed through any quantity of water in any heat.</P>

<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> The &s;alts are common &s;alt, common &s;al am|moniac, pho&s;phoric ammoniac, vitriolic &s;elenites, and muriatic &s;elenites.</P>
<P>Common &s;alt is contained in the urine, in con&s;e|quence of its being u&s;ed in the food, or drink; and it is in proportion to the quantity u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The other &s;alts are contained in the urine indepen|dent of any &s;aline &s;ub&s;tance taken into the body, except perhaps the vitriolic &s;elenites.</P>
<P>The quantity of &s;elenitic &s;alts is commonly very &s;mall; but &s;ometimes the urine is &s;aturated with vi|triolic &s;elenites, which &s;eparates, and chry&s;talizes, upon the urine's &s;tanding to cool.</P>
<P>The proportion of the &s;alts varies con&s;iderably, but is always &s;o &s;mall as to form a diluted &s;olution.</P>
<P>The &s;olution is generally &s;ufficiently concentrated, to &s;timulate a very irritable part, but not always.</P>
<P>The dilution depends on the quantity of &s;uper|fluous water in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, and on the quantity of that &s;uperfluous water evacuated by the kidneys: &s;o that, when the quantity &s;ecreted is large, the &s;o|lution is generally diluted; when &s;mall, more con|centrated.</P>
<P>Watery fluids may pa&s;s through the blood-ve&s;&s;els, and by the kidneys, hardly carrying off any thing with them, e&s;pecially if large quantities be drank at a time, and the external ve&s;&s;els be contracted.</P>

<P>If the kidneys are relaxed, or &s;timulated; chyle, &s;erum, coagulable lymph, and even the red part of the blood may be thrown out.</P>
<P>The red part may al&s;o be broke down by putre|faction, and pa&s;s off by the kidneys, of a very dark colour, di&s;turbing the tran&s;parency, and &s;ometimes forming a &s;ediment.</P>
<P>If the heart and arteries act more &s;trongly, or fre|quently, than they do in their natural &s;tate, a quan|tity of expre&s;&s;ed oil comes away with the urine, and forms a film on the &s;urface, or a ring round the ve&s;&s;el into which it is received.</P>

<P>The left &s;ide of the heart &s;erves for the general cir|culation, and con&s;i&s;ts of two cavities, the auricle and the ventricle.</P>
<P>The auricle is a cavity which opens into the pul|monary veins at one end, and into the ventricle at the other. There is a valve placed at the opening into the ventricle, which prevents any fluid from pa&s;&s;ing from the ventricle into the auricle.</P>
<P>The auricle is in part covered with mu&s;cular fibres.</P>
<P>The ventricle is a cavity &s;urrounded with mu&s;cular fibres, having one opening into the auricle, and an|other into a pipe, called the aorta or great artery.</P>
<P>At the opening into the aorta, there are valves, which prevent any fluid from pa&s;&s;ing from the aorta into the ventricle.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="32">
<P>The aorta is a tube which begins at the heart, and dividing into &s;everal branches, goes to every part of the body.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="36" MS="y">
<P>If the heart be the &s;ole power propelling the blood forward, the circulation can only be increa&s;ed in any one part by an increa&s;e in the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els, or removal of &s;ome ob&s;truction to the circulation there, or a diminution of the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els, or obstruct|tion to the circulation in the re&s;t of the body; and <HI>e contra</HI> the circulation can only be dimini&s;hed in one part by a diminution of the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els, or ob|&s;truction to the circulation there, or an increa&s;e of the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els, or a removal of &s;ome obstruct|tion to the circulation in the other parts of the body.</P>

<P>The di&s;po&s;ition to contraction in the capillaries of a particular part, or the external pre&s;&s;ure, may be in|crea&s;ed, &s;o as actually to produce a diminution of the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els of that part, (notwith&s;tanding the action of the heart,) and by con&s;equence a diminution of the circulation of the blood in that part.</P>
<P>As the ob&s;truction ari&s;ing from the meeting of the &s;treams of blood in the ana&s;tomo&s;ing ve&s;&s;els de|pends on the velocity with which it moves, it tends to render the circulation in a part equal, by pre|venting an increa&s;e or diminution of it.</P>
<P>As the blood is thoroughly mixed in the right ven|tricle of the heart, and is di&s;tributed from thence to the different parts, no alteration in its attraction to
<PB N="35" REF="37">the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els can produce an increa&s;e or diminution of the circulation in a particular part.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that a vi&s;cidity in the fluids, or an increa&s;e of the &s;ize of their particles, often produced an ob&s;truction to the circulation; but this opinion has not been proved, or rendered probable, by any experiment hitherto made public: oh the con|trary, the red globules appear to be always nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, except when they are broke down by putrefaction: the &s;erum and coagulable lymph &s;eldom or ever appear more vi&s;cid than when in their common &s;tate; and, if they were, their vi&s;cidity would affect the &s;y&s;tem equally.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition to contraction in the capillary ve&s;|&s;els, or the external pre&s;&s;ure, may be &s;o much dimi|ni&s;hed, as that the action of the heart continuing the &s;ame, the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els of a part may be in|crea&s;ed, &s;o as actually to occa&s;ion a greater circula|tion of blood in that part.</P>
<P>If the heart be the &s;ole cau&s;e of the circulation, the only material alteration that could take place in the proportion of the circulation in the different parts, mu&s;t depend on an increa&s;e or diminution of the di&s;|po&s;ition to contraction in the ve&s;&s;els, or on an altera|tion in the external pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>But the circulation may be increa&s;ed in a particu|lar part, the motion of the heart continuing the &s;ame, by cau&s;es which do not dimini&s;h the di&s;po&s;ition to contraction of the ve&s;&s;els of that part, nor increa&s;e the di&s;po&s;ition to contraction in the ve&s;&s;els in the other parts of the body, nor produce any effect on the external pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>Therefore the heart is not the &s;ole power which propels the fluids through the part in which the circu|lation is thus increa&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="38">
<P>The cau&s;es capable of increa&s;ing the circulation in a part, are generally &s;uch as tend to excite mu&s;cular motion, and are called &s;timuli.</P>
<P>Some part of the body, brought into action by the&s;e &s;timuli, is capable of increa&s;ing the circulation independent of the action of the heart.</P>
<P>The arteries are endowed with a mu&s;cular motion, by which they may increa&s;e the circulation in a par|ticular part, or a&s;&s;i&s;t the heart in the general circula|tion of the blood.</P>
<P>The arteries at each contraction of the heart are di&s;tended; at each relaxation they contract.</P>
<P>This alternate contraction and dilatation might depend on their ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>If their contractions and dilatations depended on their ela&s;ticity, their &s;ize at their utmo&s;t contraction in the living body &s;hould be equal to that produced by a fluid injected into them, with a force capable of overcoming the re&s;i&s;tance the blood meets with in the capillary ve&s;&s;els, which, in the human body, is pro|bably equal to eight feet perpendicular height of water.</P>
<P>But their &s;ize, even at their utmo&s;t &s;tate of dila|tation, is le&s;s than that produced by a fluid injected into them, with a force equal to one foot perpendi|cular height of water, when the animal is dead.</P>
<P>Therefore their contractions and dilatations do not depend on their ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>The additional force which occa&s;ions an increa&s;e of the circulation, in a particular part, mu&s;t depend on the action of the arteries or capillaries.</P>
<P>As the capillaries do not contract and dilate alter|nately, and as the direction of the blood in any one
<PB N="37" REF="39">of them is quite undetermined, this additional force cannot depend on the action of the capillaries.</P>
<P>If the arteries contracted and dilated by their elasti|city, no additional force could be applied from their contraction and dilatation; &s;ince the heart would lo&s;e more force, in di&s;tending the arteries, than they would re-apply to the blood in contracting.</P>
<P>If the arteries, upon being di&s;tended by the blood thrown into them by the heart, are excited to a mu&s;|cular contraction, and when they have performed this contraction relax, and like the ventricle of the heart, receive the blood ea&s;ily into them, and when they are again di&s;tended, are excited to a &s;econd con|traction, they may apply an additional force to that of the heart, &s;o as to promote the circulation through the whole body.</P>
<P>If &s;uch contractions and dilatations be greater in any particular part, they will promote the circulation in that part; in as much as, when they are relaxed to a greater degree, they will &s;uffer the blood to pa&s;s through them more readily into the capillaries; and, when they contract, they will empty them&s;elves more thoroughly into the capillaries.</P>
<P>The arteries have a mu&s;cular contraction and dila|tation, &s;imilar to that of the ventricles of the heart, by which they apply an additional power to that of the heart, &s;o as to promote the general circulation through the whole body, and often to increa&s;e the proportional circulation in a particular part.</P>
<P>The motion of the blood is regulated by the action of the heart and arteries, and the contraction of the capillary ve&s;&s;els; and the&s;e arc mea&s;ured by the pul&s;e.</P>

<P>The fluids, commonly extrava&s;ated, have been called the lymph.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether it pa&s;&s;es through the acci|dental pores in the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els, or by cy|lindrical organi&s;ed holes; but it is mo&s;t probable that it pa&s;&s;es through organi&s;ed holes, as the &s;ecretion is regular and con&s;tant.</P>
<P>The pores or ve&s;&s;els it pa&s;&s;es through, are called exhalants.</P>
<P>It is ab&s;orbed by the lymphatics.</P>
<P>A lymphatic is a tube nearly cylindrical, divided by valves, &s;o at to have the re&s;emblance of joints.</P>
<P>They ari&s;e from the cellular membrane, and cavi|ties, and the greate&s;t part of them go to the thoracic duct.</P>

<P>The contractile power of the blood-ve&s;&s;els &s;queezes the lymph into the cellular membrane and cavities.</P>
<P>The quantity thrown out is in proportion to the force of the circulation, the fluidity of the &s;ub&s;tances contained in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, or the quantity of the more fluid &s;ub&s;tances, and the degree of contraction of the capillaries and exhalants.</P>
<P>The joint of a lymphatic opening into a cavity, en|deavours to fill it&s;elf from that cavity by its action as a capillary tube, the valves preventing the return of the lymph from the other part of the lymphatic. In like manner a lymphatic may fill it&s;elf entirely from the cavity in which it terminates, but its action as a capillary tube will not tend in the &s;malle&s;t degree to propel the lymph into the veins.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t probable that the joint of the lymphatic, next to the cavity, having ab&s;orbed a &s;ufficient quan|tity
<PB N="45" REF="47">of lymph to fill it, is &s;timulated to contract and propel the fluid into the next joint, and &s;o on to the thoracic duct, or vein, in which it terminates; and having emptied it&s;elf, and being relaxed, it fills it&s;elf again from the cavity, and &s;o continues to act: for there is apparently no other power in the body capable of producing a regular flow of the lymph through the lymphatics into the blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>For in a living animal where the veins are con|tracting, and pre&s;&s;ing the blood, if one end of a ca|pillary tube terminate in a vein, and the other in a cavity; and if there be no action in that tube, ex|cepting that which ari&s;es from its being a capillary one, or from the motion of the blood in the vein; if there be any motion in that tube after it is full, it will always be from the vein into the cavity, and never from the cavity into the vein, let the tube be of any &s;ize or &s;hape whatever.</P>
<P>Further; the alternate pre&s;&s;ure of the lymphatics ari&s;ing from the alternate contractions and relaxations of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, or mu&s;cles, is not &s;ufficiently powerful, univer&s;al, or equal, to produce a regular flow of the lymph through the lymphatics into the blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Neither does the cellular membrane and cavities force the lymph into the lymphatics, and through them into the veins.</P>
<P>The extrava&s;ation of fluids from the blood-ve&s;&s;els in to the cellular membrane and cavities, and their re|ab&s;orption, generally take place in the above man|ner.</P>
<P>Sometimes the coagulable lymph is thrown out by the exhalants.</P>
<P>When the coagulable lymph is thrown out, it mo&s;t commonly coagulates.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="48">

<P>Part capable of original motion, are called the moving parts.</P>
<P>In many of the parts capable of original motion, there are red fibres called mu&s;cular fibres.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the parts capable of original motion, no &s;uch fibres have hitherto been demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>All the parts of the body are not capable of original motion.</P>
<P>The mu&s;cles, blood-ve&s;&s;els, lymphatics, &s;ecretories of the glands, and &s;kin, are capable of original motion.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="55">
<P>The moving parts are capable of contracting beyond that degree of contraction which would ari&s;e from their ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>All the actions of the body, and all the power which it exerts, depend upon the contraction of the moving parts.</P>
<P>When a mu&s;cular fibre, or any other moving part, continues in action for a con&s;iderable time, it does not, in general, exert one continued contraction, but a number of alternate contractions and relaxations. The relaxations, when the body is &s;trong, or the whole &s;trength is not exerted, are often hardly di&s;tin|gui&s;hable; but when the habit is weak, or the whole force exerted, they become very apparent.</P>
<P>A contraction may however probably continue for a very long time, without any intermediate relaxation, as in a &s;pa&s;m.</P>
<P>When any motion takes place in con&s;equence of a relaxation, it is from the ela&s;ticity or weight of the part, or from &s;ome external power.</P>
<P>The original motions are produced by volition ideas of the mind, or certain external applications, called &s;timuli.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be the &s;ame intercour&s;e, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;en&s;ation, between the moving part, and the brain, by means of the nerves, to render volition capable of exciting a motion in it.</P>
<P>Many of the moveable parts are incapable of being put in motion by the will.</P>
<P>An idea of the mind may excite a motion indepen|dent of, and contrary to the will, provided the part be connected with the brain by the nerves, as for &s;en|&s;ation.</P>
<P>The will may acquire a power over a moving part, which it could not affect originally.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="56">
<P>The motions excited by the will are called voluntary motions; tho&s;e excited by ideas, or &s;timuli, indepen|dent of, or contrary to the will, are called involun|tary.</P>
<P>All the parts of the human body, capable of vo|luntary motions, have red mu&s;cular fibres.</P>
<P>The will and ideas are both capable of producing contractions and relaxations in the moving parts.</P>
<P>If the communication between the brain and a moving and irritable part, be cut off by cutting thro' the nerve, a motion may be &s;till excited in it by a &s;timulus; hence &s;timuli may excite motion without affecting the brain, and therefore all the motions ex|cited by them, are not begun in the brain, and carried along the nerves to the moving part.</P>
<P>If a nerve be cut through, &s;o as to leave a portion of it adhering to a moving part, a &s;timulus applied to the nerve, may excite a motion in the moving part. Hence, the action of a nerve upon a part, may excite a motion in it; and the motions excited by the nerves, do not all ari&s;e in the brain.</P>
<P>If the communication between the brain and a moving part by the nerves continues, a &s;timulus ap|plied to the brain may excite a contraction of the moving part.</P>
<P>The motions produced by the application of &s;timuli to moving and irritable parts are apparently the &s;ame, whether the part be connected with the brain by the nerves, or not; excepting that the motions excited, become more languid after the moving part has been &s;eparated &s;ome time from the brain, and at la&s;t the power of motion in it is entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ame things are true of the motions excited by the application of &s;timuli to the nerves going to a moving part.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="57">
<P>Hence, it is probable, that the motions excited by the application of &s;timuli to a moving and irritable part, or to the nerve going to a moving part, do not ari&s;e in the brain, but immediately in the nerves, or in the part; the brain in this ca&s;e only keeping up the life of the part, and rendering it capable of motion.</P>
<P>When a &s;timulus produces a contraction in a mov|ing fibre, the force of that contraction is often far greater than the force with which the &s;timulus was applied. Therefore, when a &s;timulus excites a mo|tion, it is not in con&s;equence of a communication of the power employed in applying that &s;timulus: nay, the motion may be the very rever&s;e of that which would have been produced by the exertion of that power.</P>
<P>When a &s;timulus applied to a nerve produces a contraction in a moving fibre, it is a que&s;tion whether the motion is excited in the nerve, and communi|cated to the fibre, or produced immediately in the fibre, without any motions being excited in the nerve; for in this la&s;t there is often no apparent motion excited.</P>
<P>It has been conjectured by &s;ome, that the motion was communicated by a fluid flowing through the nerves as tubes; by others, that it was communicated by vibrations; and by others, that it ari&s;es from an ela&s;tic vapour &s;urrounding the nerves: but none of the&s;e conjectures are founded on experiment, neither are any of them any ways capable of accounting for the appearances.</P>
<P>As the influence of a &s;timulus on a moving fibre is not occa&s;ioned by any mechanical communication of motion, may not a &s;timulus applied to a nerve, exert its influence on a contractile fibre, without any
<PB N="56" REF="58">mechanical communication by any motion running along the nerve.</P>
<P>If the brain is not di&s;ea&s;ed, and two parts of the body communicate with it by the nerves, as for &s;en|&s;ation, an application made to one of the&s;e parts may excite a contraction or relaxation in the other, al|though none of the &s;ub&s;tance applied, be carried from the one to the other, and although no &s;en&s;ation be excited by the &s;timulus. Hence a medicine applied to one part of the body, may produce an effect upon another, although none of that medicine be carried to the part on which that effect is produced.</P>
<P>The effect of an application upon a part at a di&s;tance from that where it is made, may be the &s;ame which it would have produced if applied to that part; or it may be the rever&s;e, or totally unconnected with it.</P>
<P><HI>Quer.</HI> May not the application in this ca&s;e influ|ence the di&s;tant part, without any communication from a mechanical motion running along the nerves of the one part to the brain, and from the brain by the nerves to the other part?</P>
<P>An application to one part, may produce a motion in another, although it would have had no effect, if it had been made to the part it&s;elf</P>
<P>A &s;timulus applied to a part incapable of original motion, may excite a motion in a moving part at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>If the communication between the brain and any part of the body, by means of the nerves, be cut off, applications made to that part, will not affect the other parts, nor will applications to the other parts, produce motions in that; unle&s;s the nerves be cut off from a mu&s;cle, who&s;e fibres have been accu&s;tomed to contract at one and the &s;ame time, &s;uch as the heart.

<HEAD>EXERCISE, REST, SLEEP.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a moving part is brought into action by the will, an idea, or &s;timulus, that action &s;ome|times cea&s;es upon removing the cau&s;e, &s;ometimes it continues after the cau&s;e is removed. This la&s;t fre|quently happens in the production of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>When it is nece&s;&s;ary for the continuation of an action, that its cau&s;e &s;hould be continually or repeat|edly applied, the original power &s;eems gradually to be exhau&s;ted, &s;o that the motions for the mo&s;t part become gradually weaker, and at la&s;t are not to be produced, as in the ca&s;e of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome actions which are nece&s;&s;ary for life, that are continued by the application of &s;timuli, and neverthele&s;s do not exhau&s;t the original power; &s;uch as the action of the heart, the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the&s;e actions are increa&s;ed beyond their common pitch, or beyond what can be allowed by the pre&s;ent &s;trength of the &s;y&s;tem, they al&s;o exhau&s;t the original power.</P>
<P>A great exertion of the faculties of the mind al&s;o, exhau&s;ts its powers.</P>
<P>Re&s;t re&s;tores both to the body and mind their powers of action</P>
<P>In perfect &s;leep, both the body and mind are at re&s;t, excepting in tho&s;e particulars where an exertion is nece&s;&s;ary to life. The&s;e exertions are in the alternate contractions of the heart and arteries, the motion of the mu&s;cles in re&s;piration, the tone of the mu&s;cular fibres, blood-ve&s;&s;els, and other moving parts, the action of the lymphatics and excretory ducts, the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="65">
<P>The common exertions of the body and mind, when a man is awake, exhau&s;t to &s;uch a degree, as to require that re&s;t which is found in &s;leep to allow the original power to recruit it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;leep the mind is often brought into action, &s;ome|times from affections of its own, &s;ometimes from affections of the body. The body al&s;o exerts other powers be&s;ides tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for life. In the&s;e ca&s;es the original power is le&s;s recruited, and that in pro|portion to the exertion.</P>
<P>Although the original power may be &s;o far ex|hau&s;ted as to require to be recruited by &s;leep, that &s;tate may neverthele&s;s be prevented by any thing ex|citing great attention of the mind, by applications to the body producing unea&s;ine&s;s or pain, or by an in|crea&s;ed action of any of its parts, or by any action or contraction which continues after its cau&s;e is removed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;es may render &s;leep le&s;s perfect, al|though not &s;ufficient to prevent it altogether.</P>
<P>Although re&s;t is not compleat at the beginning of &s;leep, it has a tendency to become &s;o during this &s;tate of the body. In particular, all actions and contrac|tions remaining after their cau&s;e has been removed, are apt to go off.</P>
<P>During &s;leep the original power appears to be &s;o much accumulated, as to give a di&s;po&s;ition to action, both to the mind and body, from the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;e, and this &s;tate of the body goes off of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>At the beginning of &s;leep, the re&s;t is generally le&s;s perfect; it becomes gradually more &s;o for a certain time afterwards. When the original power is re|cruited, the mind begins to be put in action, and at la&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem, at which time &s;leep goes off.</P>
<P>A continued or &s;trong action of one part of the body, may not only exhau&s;t the original power in that part, but al&s;o in all the others.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="66">
<P>A great exertion of the powers of the body, may exhau&s;t the powers of die mind, and <HI>&eacute; contra,</HI> a great exertion of the powers of the mind, may exhau&s;t tho&s;e of the body.</P>
<P>A frequent exertion of the original power in one part of the body, tends to &s;trengthen that part, but to weaken the other.</P>
<P>An exertion of the original power, increa&s;es the lo&s;s of fluids, and renders a greater quantity of food nece&s;&s;ary. Hence animals that require a con&s;iderable quantity of nouri&s;hment when awake, may &s;leep for &s;everal months without any being taken in.</P>
<P>A lo&s;s of fluids generally increa&s;es the powers of di|ge&s;tion, excepting when they are di&s;ordered by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A moderate exertion of the powers of the body, in proportion to the pre&s;ent &s;trength, powers of dige&s;tion, food, and &s;leep, tends to &s;trengthen the whole body.</P>
<P>A violent or continued exertion of the original power, if it be not recruited by food and &s;leep, may weaken to that degree as to kill.</P>
<P>A repeated exertion of the powers of the mind, tends to &s;trengthen its faculties; but at the &s;ame time to weaken the original power in the body.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the body be endowed with a certain degree of &s;trength, the mind cannot exert it&s;elf powerfully.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e of the powers of the body, tends to weaken the mind, except &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary to give the body the proper &s;trength.</P>
<P>But a moderate exerci&s;e of the body and mind to|gether, tends to &s;trengthen the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;o that by cu&s;tom the original power in the whole may be increa&s;ed.</P>
