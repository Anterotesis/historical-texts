<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE kind Reception this Book has met with from the Publick, appears by nothing more than the quick Sale of the former Editions: There have not been many Phy&s;ick Books, in Re&s;pect to the large Number that have been publi&s;h'd, of which Three Thou&s;and Copies have in &s;o &s;hort a Time been di&s;pos'd of; but its having been well received, and &s;o much call'd for, &s;ince out of <HI>Print,</HI> is not the only Motive of reprinting it; the great good the Medicines pre&s;cribed in it have done and daily do to abundance of People afflicted with Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Head, Brain,</HI> and <HI>Nerves,</HI> as al&s;o to tho&s;e oppre&s;s'd with <HI>Me|lancholly</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> is another of much greater weight; for it being rea&s;onable to believe there are many hundreds of Per&s;ons troubled with tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, who have not yet &s;een it, and who by reading it may meet with their Cure, as va&s;t Numbers have already done, I thought my &s;elf for their Sakes, as well as my own Advantage, o|bliged to &s;end it again to the Pre&s;s; and upon looking it over carefully with that Intention, I did not find occa&s;ion for any very material Additions, and therefore omitted &s;ome of &s;light Con&s;equence I might have made, purely becau&s;e tho&s;e who have bought the other Editions, might not think them&s;elves impos'd upon or be obliged to buy this Fourth, which for that Rea&s;onis &s;ent into the World again exactly as before, &s;ome very few Corrections excepted.</P>
<P>Of all the Di&s;ea&s;es incident to Mankind, there are none more dangerous and mortal than tho&s;e of the <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Brain,</HI> and this my Experience in the Cure of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es has convinced me of, tho' I mu&s;t do my &s;elf Ju|&s;tice in declaring, that I have had as few Patients mi&s;|carryed, con&s;idering the Number I have in my Time at|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ended, as perhaps any Phy&s;ician before me: And have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ured &s;ome who have been &s;o very bad, through delay or
<PB REF="4">improper Medicines, that there was &s;carce a Probability of re&s;toring. The Melancholly Circum&s;tances of Per&s;ons &s;o afflicted, is matter of great Concern, becau&s;e we daily find ignorant Men, who would be thought Doctors, tampering in tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, as if there were no danger in them at all; but this in our days is but what was in the days of our Predece&s;&s;ors, tho' more now than then, the Art of Phy&s;ick being &s;urely never more abu&s;ed than at this time, and that becau&s;e there is no Puni&s;hment inflicted on them be&s;ides Reproach, which they &s;o little care for, that from their wonted A&s;&s;urance they nothing le&s;s than laugh at.</P>
<P>The mature Con&s;ideration of this, and the Mi&s;chiefs I my &s;elf have &s;een in my Practice, by in&s;ignificant or impro|per Medicines and Management, together with the Succe&s;s I have had in many de&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Head,</HI> fir&s;t put me upon writing this Treati&s;e, this Fourth Edition of which, I am in hopes will be as kindly accepted by tho&s;e &s;o afflicted, as I am &s;ure they will upon Tryal find the Methods and Medicines directed to, an&s;wer what is &s;aid of them.</P>
<P>The Title Page tells you, It is a Treati&s;e of Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Head, Brain,</HI> and <HI>Nerves;</HI> and &s;o it is, but as the Eyes, No&s;e, Tongue, Teeth, Gums, Jaws and Palate, go to the making up of the Head, the Reader may expect perhaps, I have treated of them al&s;o, which he will not find done, and that becau&s;e it was no way material here, any further than that in Chapter the 12th, where I &s;peak of Catarrhs or Defluxions, I have &s;hewn how tho&s;e Hu|mours affect tho&s;e Parts, and that many times by the remo|ving tho&s;e Humours, tho&s;e Parts are relieved.</P>
<P>To this Treati&s;e of Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Head,</HI> I have &s;ubjoined a Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>Melancholly</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> which tho' they are not properly Head Di&s;ea&s;es, yet bear &s;uch analogy to them, or at lea&s;t &s;o far affect either the <HI>Head, Brain, Nerves,</HI> or all, that they come properly e|nough to be con&s;idered here; and I per&s;wade my &s;elf the
<PB REF="5">Account given of them, will not fall very, &s;hort of any Performance of the like Nature, at lea&s;twi&s;e as to the main thing, I mean, the Curative Part, which however, will be better under&s;tood upon the Patient's Experience than by any thing I can &s;ay.</P>
<P>I had put my Name and Place of Habitation to this Book, but that I fore&s;aw it might not be &s;o well as let alone in this cen&s;orious Age, therefore re&s;olved again&s;t it, not that I have any rea&s;on, I thank God, to conceal my &s;elf, or need be a&s;hamed either of one or the other; but to &s;upply that want, I have taken Care to make what I have written the more Plain and Intelligible, having, in each Di&s;ea&s;e, not only pre&s;crib'd what Methods are to be ob|&s;erved, and Medicines I have found u&s;eful to many, but al&s;o directed, at the end of the Book, where tho&s;e pe|culiar ones I have pre&s;cribed in it, and always found to &s;tand me in &s;tead on the mo&s;t urgent Occa&s;ions are to be had, I me an by tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand how, or care not to take the trouble of preparing them them&s;elves; which by being taken and u&s;ed at the Book directs, will by the Help of God, work a perfect Cure, and the Patients have no Occa&s;ion to trouble either them&s;elves or me, for any further Advice or Direction.</P>
<P>This I thought good to hint, with an A&s;&s;urance that what is written about the &s;everal Di&s;tempers, is what the Patients afflicted, too truely find, and al&s;o that the Re|medies for Cure, are well adapted, replete with Power to effect what is &s;aid of them, and which I have the Vanity to believe, the Patient will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, give Credit to, upon the bear reading what he will find written, tho' I am not &s;o weak as to expect anything that is or can be &s;aid of them, will or can convince him like his making Tryal of them him&s;elf, my Encomiums on 'em, falling far &s;hort of what his own Experiencing will prove they de&s;erve. Therefore the Reader is de&s;ired to &s;u&s;pend his Opinion of the Book and Medicines, till he has Read the
<PB REF="6">former, and Tryed the latter, whatever he judges of the Author, who conceives, let what will be &s;aid or thought of him, by the Method he has taken to &s;erve the Publick and Him&s;elf, if matters not, if what is &s;aid and recom|mended in the Book, an&s;wer but the Patient's End.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE OF DISEASES OF THE Head; Brain <HI>and</HI> Nerves.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Head-Ach</HEAD>
<P>THERE are Two &s;orts of Head-ach, the Recent or New, and Inveterate or Old Head-ach: The former la&s;ts but for a time only; and is either from Cold, hard Drinking, heat of the Sun, violent Exerci&s;e, or the like; and goes away as tho&s;e Occa&s;ions wear off. The other is con&s;tant or la&s;ting, with
<PB N="2" REF="8">very little abatement or intermi&s;&s;ion, is hard to be eas'd, and which on light Occa&s;ions, has Extream &s;harp Fits, &s;o that the Patient cannot endure any Noi&s;e or vehement Motion, or &s;carce any Light, but de&s;ires to lye in the Dark, and be &s;till; for Noi&s;e, if it be great, renders him almo&s;t craz'd. But tho', as in &s;ome, the Inveterate, or Old Head-ach, con|tinues always more or le&s;s, in others, it goes away and returns by Fits.</P>
<P>They are both under&s;tood by the &s;ame common Name of the Heach-ach, but are va&s;tly different as to Cure, the fir&s;t going away upon the occa&s;ion cea&s;ing, as I have already &s;aid, the other, being of long &s;tanding, is inveterate, and with difficulty removed; it being cau&s;ed either thro' much Blood, Di&s;order of the Stomach, or &s;harp Humours con|tained within or without the Skull, inflaming the Head, and depraving the Sen&s;e. If the Pain be attended with Heavine&s;s, it comes of Plenitude: If with pricking and &s;hooting, it proceeds from &s;harp Cholerick Humours: If the Head &s;eems di&s;tended without Heavine&s;s and Beating, Wind is the Cau&s;e; but if with Beating, there is Inflammation in the Films of the Brain: If there be a Heavine&s;s with Di&s;tention, it &s;hews Plenitude of Humours within the Films: If the Pain be outward, it is in the Films that cover the Scull; but if inward, and at the Roots of the Eyes, the Films that cover the Brain are griev'd. The external Pain is in the <HI>Pe|ricranium</HI> or the Membrane without the Scull, and comes for the mo&s;t part from external Cold, becau&s;e a cold part will ea&s;ily &s;uffer from the like Quality; the internal Pain is always in the <HI>Meninges</HI> or in|ternal Membranes.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="9">
<P>But as the Head-ach, inveterate or old, proceeds chiefly from inward Cau&s;es, either from &s;ome fault in the Head it &s;elf, or di&s;order of the Stomach, I &s;hall &s;peak only of that, the recent Head-ach, as already &s;aid, going away of it &s;elf upon a little Re&s;t and Regularity, without any Medicines.</P>
<P>If the Pain proceeds from the Head e&s;&s;entially, there will be no Intermi&s;&s;ion, but a continual Pain, or if the Pain does remit, it is but for a little time, and returneth again.</P>
<P>If it proceeds from the Stomach, the Pain will of|ten cea&s;e, and return again; al&s;o the Appetite will decay, e&s;pecially if the Stomach abounds much with Flegm; but if the Stomach abounds much with Choller, there will be a Bitterne&s;s in the Mouth, a gnawing Pain of the Stomach, a <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI> or loathing of Food, trembling of the Heart and In|flammation, which are much increa&s;ed after &s;leep.</P>
<P>If the Head-ach proceeds from the Head e&s;&s;entially, I always give my following Cephalick purging Pills, which never fail moving off tho&s;e Humours that infe&s;t the Brain and its <HI>Meninges,</HI> whereby the Pa|tient has in&s;tant ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But when the Head-ach proceeds from the Sto|mach, I ever give my Emetick Pouder, pre&s;ently to be pre&s;crib'd, which gently and &s;afely, yet thorough, ly, evacuates the offending Cau&s;e, and &s;ets the Pa|tient to rights, more e&s;pecially if in each Ca&s;e my Cephalick Elixir, prepar'd as follows, on the inter|mediate days be al&s;o taken.</P>

<P>By the Signs before given, any one that is afflicted with the Head-ach may di&s;tingui&s;h and know his Ca&s;e, and accordingly with the Medicines pre&s;crib'd may have his Cure, they having been long expe|rienc'd by the Author to be the mo&s;t effectual in tho&s;e Ca&s;es. The Pills are to be taken three at a time over Night, which will the next Morning give four, five, or &s;ix ea&s;y Stools: Warm Water-gruel, Broth, Po&s;&s;et-drink or Tea, are Liquors pro|per to be drank as they operate, and the Patient keeping a little warm the days he takes them will be the better. They may be repeated twice or thrice in a Week, as there is Occa&s;ion, as al&s;o mu&s;t be the Emetick Pouder, which is to be taken by tho&s;e who&s;e Stomachs being foul, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the Cau&s;e of the Head-ach; but as the Pills are to be taken at Night, the Pouder is to be taken in a Morning in a Spoonful of Water-gruel, with the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation and Care as directed for the pur|ging Pills.</P>
<P>And on the intermediate days of taking either the Cephalick Pills, or Emetick Pouder, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry for the Patient to take the Cephalick Elixir, Forty or Fifty Drops at a time, every Night and Morning in a Gla&s;s of Wine, Ale, Beer, Tea, Coffee or what other Liquor, plea&s;es be&s;t, which together with the Pills or Pouder will have wonderful Effects in altering and regulating tho&s;e Humours that create the Di&s;order and Pain in the Head.</P>

<P>A young Lady of One and twenty Years of Age, the only Daughter of a worthy Gentleman, had been afflicted with a violent Pain of the Head from a Child, which &s;he was &s;eldom or never free from, and when it was at the wor&s;t would cau&s;e Vomi|ting. Her Parents had tryed almo&s;t every body; &s;ome a&s;crib'd the Cau&s;e to one thing, others to others; at la&s;t &s;ome body that had heard of the &s;ucce&s;s of my Medicines for the Head, recommen|ded them, and my Opinion was accordingly de&s;ired.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Megrim.</HEAD>
<P>THE Megrim is a vehement Pain in one half of the Head, either on the Right or Left &s;ide thereof, afflicting either the <HI>Teguments</HI> without the Scull, or the <HI>Meninges</HI> of the Brain within, agree|ing in Quality and coming near the Nature of the Old Head-ach, &s;poken of in the 'foregoing Chapter. If it be without the Scull, the Part pain'd is mo&s;t commonly &s;o &s;ore that the Patient can hardly bear its being touch'd; if it be within the Scull, that Sorene&s;s is wanting, and the Pain is the more vehe|ment. Sometimes the Pain is more towards the <HI>Occiput</HI> or hinder part of the Head, and &s;ometimes more toward the <HI>Sinciput</HI> or fore part of the Head, or near the Root of the Eye on that &s;ide which is, pain'd. If it be accidental, it never afflicts the Pa|tient but upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions; but if it be habitual, it returns either at &s;et periods of Time, or keeps an uncertain irregular Cour&s;e, being excited without any apparent Cau&s;e, continuing long and with that vehemency that the Patient thinks it will di&s;tract him.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Signs it appears, that as the Megrim is from like Cau&s;es of the Head-ach, &s;poken of in the la&s;t Chapter, &s;o the Cure is to be attempted; and tho' many Authors have pre&s;cribed many Medi|cines both for one and the other, yet they allow they are to be remedied, if &s;uch a thing be to be done, with the &s;ame Medicines, which I al&s;o have experienced; and the be&s;t to do it, that ever I met with, are what I have recommended in the former Chapter, and which if the Patient keeps to, I mean
<PB N="9" REF="15">both Pills, Pouder, and Elixir, the former to be taken as mention'd, alternarely, that is, one time the Pills, the next time the Pouder, and &s;o on, and the Elixir the days on which neither the Pills or Pouder are taken, will undoubtedly free the Patient therefrom, if it be in the Power of Medicine to do it. I have performed the Cure by them in &s;everal; and parti|cularly in a Gentlewoman who about the time her Monthly Vi&s;its left her, was &s;o afflicted with the Megrim, &s;ometimes of one &s;ide of the Head, at o|ther times on the other, that &s;he had very little Ea&s;e Night or Day; She relating her Ca&s;e to me, I gave her both my Pills, Pouder, and Elixir, which in five Weeks carryed off her Pain perfectly, &s;o that &s;he was, and is as free from it as ever in her Life, tho' it is many Months &s;ince.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP III.</HI> Of the Vertigo, Giddine&s;s or Swimming of the Head.</HEAD>
<P>THE Vertigo, Giddine&s;s or Swimming of the Head, is a Di&s;ea&s;e in the Cavities of the Brain, cau&s;ing the Patient to think all things turn round, and many times cau&s;es him to &s;tagger and reel, and &s;ometimes to fall down, the Brain and Sen&s;es being di&s;turb'd, but often times without any Pain, by a preternatural Exagitation and Commotion, yet depriving not the Patient of either Sen&s;e or Motion.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e is twofold, one <HI>Simple,</HI> wherein the Sight remains unhurt, the other <HI>Complex,</HI> where|in the Sight is darkened, as it were, with a Mi&s;t or Cloud, and is call'd <HI>Scotoma.</HI></P>
<P>The Signs by which the Vertigo is known, is, by what has been &s;aid, only when the Di&s;ea&s;e is recent
<PB N="10" REF="16">or but gentle, the Patient &s;eldom falls, but &s;taggers as it were, a little, and is confounded in his Mind by a certain kind of Amazement, from the &s;udden Exagitation of the Animal Spirits, &s;o that if he be walking he knows not where he is, but mu&s;t be forc'd to &s;tand &s;till to con&s;ult the place of his pre|&s;ent Station, whither he is going and what is the Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e a &s;trange kind of Forgetfulne&s;s &s;eizes him, notwith&s;tanding all this while his inter|nal Sen&s;es are not &s;o di&s;turbed, but that he knows he is about Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' the particulars be forgotten, which after a little pau&s;e he recollects again, and becomes perfectly well.</P>
<P>Sometimes, as already &s;aid, this Affect is accom|panied with Dimne&s;s and Darkne&s;s of the Sight, repre&s;enting variety of Colours, and things to look double and treble, in which Ca&s;e not only all the other Symptoms are exi&s;tent, but the Circum|volution or Rotation of Things &s;eem to be with a great Violence or Vehemency, in&s;omuch that when the Paroxy&s;m &s;eizes the Patient, he will ne|ce&s;&s;arily fall, unle&s;s he catches hold of &s;omething to &s;upport him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e happens chiefly in Winter, and to People that are fa&s;ting, and is of very dangerous Con&s;equence if not in time remedied; for it comes from Blood and Humours in the Brain, but chiefly from cold Humours and flatulent Vapours ari&s;ing from the Stomach or other inferior Parts, cau&s;ing a continual Pain in the Head, Noi&s;e in the Ears, Dul|ne&s;s of the Sen&s;es, Lo&s;s of Smelling and &s;ometimes of Ta&s;ting; and if it comes by con&s;ent of the Sto|mach, then there follows a gnawing Pain of the Stomach, Trembling, and &s;ometimes Vomiting, with a bad Dige&s;tion.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="17">
<P>When the Vertigo has been of long &s;tanding, it generally terminates in a <HI>Scotoma</HI> and too quickly then changes into pernicious Di&s;ea&s;es, as the Falling Sickne&s;s and Apoplexy. If it happens to old People it is the more dangerous, becau&s;e of the Weakne&s;s of their Brain, Smallne&s;s of their Heat and their abounding much with Flegm. If in any that have this Di&s;ea&s;e, Things appear to their Eyes bloody and reddi&s;h, it foretells Madne&s;s; if purple Colour, the Falling Sickne&s;s e&s;pecially &s;uch as have the <HI>Sco|toma,</HI> or dark Vertigo. Sometimes the Cau&s;e of a Vertigo has been from a Bladder of Water contain'd in one of the Ventricles of the Brain, ca&s;t off from the vitiated Blood thither, and is &s;eldom if ever curable, tho' the Patient at the &s;ame time Eats, Drinks, and Dige&s;ts well. I never knew one cured when it had been &s;o, but have been an Eye Witne&s;s to tho&s;e that have dyed thereof, and one particular Man of Seventy odd Years of Age who was di&s;&s;ected, who, tho' he was troubled with a Vertigo, was otherwi&s;e con&s;tantly in perfect Health. At fir&s;t the Fits came upon him but two or three times a Year, afterwards they came once a Month, and as he grew older and older, the Di&s;ea&s;e grew &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and the Paroxy&s;ms more frequent and of longer continuance, till at length he had a Fit once a Week: The la&s;t Fit he had, he complain'd that all things turn'd round violently, and altho' he lean'd upon a Table, call'd out vehemently for &s;ome body to hold him, for el&s;e he &s;hould fall by the ha&s;ty turning round of Things. He de&s;ired to go to Bed forthwith, which he did, and whil&s;t he lay &s;till, he &s;eem'd to be &s;omewhat pacify'd; but upon the lea&s;t turning of his Head or any part of his Body, he cryed out that the Bed
<PB N="12" REF="18">and Hou&s;e would be turned top&s;y turvy; and all this while he had no Convul&s;ion, Frenzy or Madne&s;s, or the lea&s;t appearance of a Fever, ex|cept about four or five Hours before his Death. As I &s;aid before, when this Man's Head was open'd, there was found a Bladder of Water about the bigne&s;s of a Pigeon's Egg, lying in the 'foremo&s;t Ventricle of the Brain, which alone was the Cau&s;e of his Death. The Cure of a Vertigo, if it be &s;imple, is not very difficult, it being to be done mo&s;t commonly by Medicines that di&s;cu&s;s the flatu|lent Spirits, which trouble the Ventricles of the Brain, or that &s;till and quiet the too great Ema|nations of the Animal Spirits, and that comfort and &s;trengthen the Brain that is hurt or weaken'd by the &s;aid Flatulency and Irregularities of the Spirits. The fir&s;t is perform'd by heating Cephalicks in|wardly and outwardly, which have Power to di&s;|cu&s;s any Vento&s;ity lodged in the Cortex of the Brain. The &s;econd by Medicines that delight, comfort, refre&s;h, and &s;trengthen the Brain.</P>
<P>Authors innumerate Medicines for both pur|po&s;es, and tho&s;e of Amber, Nutmegs, Ro&s;emary, Sage, Oranges, Lemons, Ambergree&s;e, Musk, Pea|cock's Dung, and the like; but the be&s;t thing that ever I knew to be univer&s;ally &s;ucce&s;sful, is my Ver|tiginous Spirit following, of which fifty Drops be|ing taken every Night and Morning, in a Di&s;h of Green Tea, or which is better, in Tea made of Ro&s;emary, Lavender, Carraway Seeds, Sage, Juni|per Berries, and Sweet Majoram, will have incre|dible Effect, more e&s;pecially if a few Drops of the Spirit be Snuff'd up the No&s;trils twice or thrice a Day, and the Forehead, Temples, top of the Head, and Nape of the Neck, be bathed with it; by
<PB N="13" REF="19">which means the windy Vapours will be di&s;&s;ipated, the Brain comforted, &s;trengthen'd and fortify'd much more than by any other Medicine that I know of whatever; only now and then it may be proper for the Patient, the better to carry off the offending Cau&s;e, to take a Do&s;e of the Cephalick purging Pills, pre&s;cribed in the fir&s;t Chapter, or rather if he finds any Di&s;order of the Stomach, to &s;upply their place with the Emetick Pouder there|in al&s;o pre&s;crib'd.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of Forgetfulne&s;s or Dotage.</HEAD>
<P>FOrgetfulne&s;s is a Di&s;ea&s;e proceeding from ma|lign Vapours, or an over hot, or over cold and moi&s;t Temperament of the Brain, which ren|ders the Animal Spirits either too Volatile, that the Thoughts are not to be contracted, or el&s;e too Torpid, dimini&s;hing the natural Heat, that the Per&s;on is dull, &s;luggi&s;h, has no Memory, and can think of nothing as he &s;hould.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;es of tho&s;e malign Vapours, or over hot, or cold and moi&s;t Temperament of the Brain, are either Natural or Preternatural: If they proceed
<PB N="15" REF="21">from Natural Cau&s;es, as &s;ometimes they do, from an ill Conformity of the Head and Brain, or over great Thickne&s;s of the &s;ame, or from too &s;trait or wide Pa&s;&s;ages, by which the Spirits are either too much compre&s;&s;ed or dilated, they are &s;carcely to be remedied. But if the Cau&s;es be from Pol&s;on taken, or too many Narcotick Medicines, or from over Watchings, too much Care, bad Air, Sickne&s;s, or the like, they may in time be remedied; but if from Falls or Blows, that the Brain is concu&s;&s;ed, and the Animal Spirits di&s;&s;ipated or &s;pent, are incura|ble; for in Youth they breed Folly, and in People of Years Dotage,</P>
<P>But Dotage does not happen altogether to old People neither, for as it is a Depravation of the Fancy and Rational Faculty, ari&s;ing from an Irregular Phan|ta&s;m of the Brain, by a Fault of the Animal Spirits which are clouded, darken'd, made black, thick, and opacous, young People may be liable to it as well as old. The Signs of Dotage in the beginning of the Di&s;temper, are perceived by the Patient's be|ing much more Talkative than u&s;ual, (e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are of few Words when they are well) and in tho&s;e that u&s;ed to be very Taltative when well, it is perceived by their &s;itting very mute, taking no Notice of any thing, and as it were thinking intentively on &s;omething, tho' when ask'd, can give no Account of what. In the height of Dotage, in a mild temper'd Per&s;on, there is Fierce. ne&s;s, Ribaldry and Scurrilous Language, the Mo|tion of the Eyes quick, they being affected by Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ent of the Brain, Arteries, Veins and Nerves, the Pul&s;e irregular and &s;wift, with a Perturbation in the Hypochondria, the Speech and Actions at the &s;ame time being altogether unaccountable, in|congruous
<PB N="16" REF="22">and fooli&s;h, the Patient being apt to be bu&s;ied about Toys and Trifles, if not down-right Folly, which &s;hews the principal Faculties of the Mind are extreamly depraved.</P>
<P>The&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es are commonly without any Dan|ger attending as to Life, but if they happen to Children very young, they oftentimes make the Child a Fool; but taken in time are to be cured, and &s;o are they many times in People of Years, but not always, as &s;hewn before. I have known, when they have been taken in time, that a proper Vomit and a Volatile Specifick hath rou&s;ed up Nature's Force, that the Patient hath recovered, and found his Spirits more Vigete, Lively, and his Memory quicker than at any time before, and that by taking my Emetick Pouder pre&s;crib'd in Chapter Fir&s;t, and my Vertiginous Spirit in Chapter the Third, and that in the Particular Ca&s;e following.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of a Brisk and Airy Temper, quick Wit and Ingenuity, and of an Excellent Apprehen|&s;ion, Judgment and Memory, fell fir&s;t into For|getfulne&s;s and Lo&s;s of Memory, and after into a Dotage upon &s;ome Trouble of Mind, in&s;omuch, that he would talk very fooli&s;hly, ask the &s;ame Que&s;tion over and over, and would &s;ometimes, without any Cau&s;e, fall a Laughing, at other times Crying, ju&s;t like a Child, which &s;hew'd that his Intellectuals were really much deprav'd, in&s;omuch that I greatly que&s;tioned whether I could do him any Service; however, upon his Friends earne&s;t de&s;ire I would try, I &s;ent him Three Papers of my Emetick Pouder, and a Bottle of my Vertiginous Spirit, with Directions for his taking One of the Papers every other Morning, and Fifty Drops of the Spirit every Morning be&s;ides, and al&s;o every

But where there is a perfect Madne&s;s and Di&s;tra|ction, other Methods mu&s;t be taken, as Cupping with Scarifications, large Bleedings, Gly&s;ters, Bli&s;ters, Hypnoticks, frequent Purging and Vomi|ting, to do which two la&s;t, nothing, I &s;ay, can be more prevalent than my Cephalick Pills and Eme|tick Pouder, given alternately as often as the Pa|tient's &s;trength can bear them.</P>
<P>I know there are many who pretend to Cure Madne&s;s by &s;ome particular Methods, others by &s;uch and &s;uch a peculiar Specifick, but with what Succe&s;s they know be&s;t.

I told the Me&s;&s;enger the be&s;t Medicines I knew for Cure, were my Emetick Pouder and Ce|phalick purging Pills, &s;ome of both which I gave her, with Directions to give him One Paper of the Emetick Pouder one Day, and re&s;ting the next Day, to give Four of the purging Pills the Day following, and &s;o every other Day the Pouder or Pills, which was done, and the patient was much better; but coming for more, the Me&s;&s;en|ger told me they were advi&s;ed to give him the following Drink, as one of the mo&s;t certain Specificks for Madne&s;s m the World. I an&s;wer'd I could not tell what Extraordinary Vertues were in it, but they might give it notwith&s;tanding his ta|king my Pouder and Pills, which they did, and the

However, that the Publick may be the better for knowing it, if there be any thing of what is &s;aid in it, I here give the Pre&s;cription ju&s;t as they related it to me.</P>

<P>All &s;leepy Di&s;ea&s;es, if of long continuance, and tho&s;e happen in Fat, Gro&s;s, and Old People, are generally incurable, and by how much deeper the Sleep is, or the Patient the harder to wake, by &s;o much the more is the Di&s;ea&s;e dangerous, and that e&s;pecially if it happens after the going off of an Acute Di&s;ea&s;e; and if the &s;leepy Di&s;ea&s;e be exqui&s;ite, and the Strength decays and wa&s;tes, it is certainly ne|ver to be cured. But if it happens to one that
<PB N="21" REF="27">is Young, and in the Heat of Summer, and the Animal Functions be not much impair'd, and all the Natural Evacuations be perfect, there may be a Cure; to accompli&s;h which, Evacuations by Bleeding, Bli&s;tering and Purging, mu&s;t be made, the latter not by any thing better than my Cepha|lick Pills pre&s;crib'd in Chapter the fir&s;t; and then for a Specifick to repercu&s;s the Humour that of|fends, and &s;trengthen the Brain, I cannot advi&s;e a more prevalent Preparation than my Volatile E&s;&s;ence following; which di&s;charges the Animal Spirits of their Burthen, and quickens them to an immen&s;e Degree. The Method to be ob&s;erved is this: Fir&s;t let the Patient Bleed in the Arm Twelve Ounces, or according as he is in Age and Strength. After that apply a &s;trong large Bli&s;ter to his Neck, or rather between his Shoulders; then the next Night, or next Morning, which he plea&s;es, let him take Four of the Cephalick Pills, which will gently purge him, and every Night and every Morning, (excepting the Nights and Morn|ings he takes the Pills) as al&s;o about Four in the Afternoon, let him take Sixty Drops of my Vo|latile E&s;&s;ence in a Di&s;h of Tea, or which is more effectual, in a Di&s;h of the Infu&s;ion of Ro&s;emary, Lavender, Carraway Seeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> directed in Chapter the Third, which if followed &s;trictly and the Patient's No&s;trils and Temples be rubb'd &s;eve|ral times a Day with a little of the Volatile E&s;|&s;ence, and a few Drops of it &s;nuff'd up his No&s;e now and then, will undoubtedly, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, bring him to him&s;elf, if he be curable, and prevent the Di&s;temper for the future, if the Medi|cines be but for a time continued.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Coma, or &V;nnatural Watchings.</HEAD>
<P>THE Coma is a great De&s;ire and Inclination to Sleep, but with an utter inability to do it, ari&s;ing from Narcotick Vapours which infe&s;t the Brain and induce the drow&s;y or &s;leepy Indi&s;|po&s;ition, yet at the &s;ame time &s;o trouble and di&s;|quiet the Mind, that they cannot &s;leep at all, but wink with their Eyes and often open them, having a doting kind of Di&s;cour&s;e, attended with an inor|dinate Motion of the Hands and Thighs.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="29">
<P>It is cau&s;ed &s;ometimes by a great weakne&s;s of the Faculties of the Body, either from &s;ome grie|vous Di&s;ea&s;e and violent Pains, or from immode|rate Evacuations, which have di&s;&s;ipated the Ani|mal Spirits. Unnatural Watchings, are when the common external &s;en&s;e is wearied beyond due or ju&s;t mea&s;ure, ari&s;ing from the continual uninterrupt|ed Influx of the Spirits into the Organs, as we find when we have over tired our &s;elves by much Walking, Running or Riding, we cannot &s;leep, tho' we greatly want and de&s;ire it, but tumble, and to&s;s and &s;tretch.</P>
<P>Unnatural Watchings are al&s;o occa&s;ioned by too much Light, Noi&s;e, Cares of the Mind, being too thoughtful or intent upon Matters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which hinder Sleep, al&s;o Pains, Coughs, Fluxes, a hot Di&s;temper of the Brain, hot, &s;harp, and &s;alt Va|pours, which twitch and di&s;turb the Spirits and <HI>Meninges</HI> of the Brain, making People unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s; or from difect of &s;uch natural Vapours, as procure Re&s;t to the Animal Spirits, which long Ab&s;tinence from Food will cau&s;e, as al&s;o Eating too much, e&s;pecially Suppers.</P>
<P>When Watchings proceed from a Di&s;ea&s;e, and become a Coma of long &s;tanding, the Cure is very doubtful, e&s;pecially if they have their Speech hindred, or when they breathe, a murmuring Noi&s;e be heard in the Throat, or a thin Humour di&s;tils out of the No&s;trils, or the Patient not able to &s;wal|low without difficulty, for in tho&s;e Ca&s;es it is dan|gerous, or at lea&s;t they degenerate into a Lethargy or Frenzy,</P>

<PB N="24" REF="30">is be&s;t accompli&s;h'd, e&s;pecially in the Coma, by my Cephalick purging Pills and Cephalick Elixir, pre&s;cribed in Chapter the Fir&s;t; and which if ta|ken as therein directed, will carry off tho&s;e of|fending Humours, that the Patient will have his Natural Re&s;t, without taking Opiates and other Narcotick Medicines, which, as they only palliate the Di&s;temper, and give ea&s;e but for a while, do in the end rather injure than relieve.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Apoplexy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Apoplexy is a Di&s;ea&s;e of the Brain, &s;ud|denly depriving the whole Body of Sen&s;e and Motion. <HI>Riolanus</HI> defines it to be an Abolition of Sen&s;e and Motion, with Re&s;piration hurt, which at la&s;t brings Snorting and Suffocation, by rea|&s;on of thick Flegm flowing out of the Funnel, and ob&s;tructing the <HI>Larynx</HI> or Wind-pipe, which al&s;o oftentimes and unexpectedly invades all the Ventri|cles of the Brain, but e&s;pecially the Fourth Ventri|cle, wherein, unle&s;s the Matter be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the Spinal Marrow, Death unavoidably follows. <HI>Ferne|lius</HI> &s;ays, that an Apoplexy is a Di&s;ea&s;e bred by an Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Rete Mirabile,</HI> the Afflux of Ar|terial blood out of the Heart into the Brain, being thereby intercepted. <HI>Willis</HI> &s;ays the Sen&s;e of the Word Apoplexy denotes Percu&s;&s;ion, and by rea&s;on of the &s;tupendious Quality of the Di&s;temper, con|taining, as it were &s;omething &s;upernatural, it is call'd Sideration or Bla&s;ting; for tho&s;e &s;truck there|with, are, as it were, Planet &s;truck, or &s;truck with an invi&s;ible Power, falling &s;uddenly to the Ground, and being depriv'd both of Sen&s;e and Motion; and the whole Animal Function cea&s;ing,
<PB N="25" REF="31">(&s;ave that they breathe) they lye for a long &s;ea&s;on as if Dead, and &s;ometimes, yea too often, are dead indeed, (many of which I hope to &s;hew might have been, and how others may be pre&s;erv'd) but if they revive, they are many times taken with an Univer&s;al Pal&s;y, or el&s;e with the Pal&s;y of one Side. <HI>Riverius</HI> &s;ays it is a mo&s;t deep Sleep, and a total Privation of Sen&s;e and Motion, Breathing excepted, wherein the Patient neither opens his Eyes, an&s;wers, or feels, when he is &s;poken to, or hurt, breathing al&s;o with difficulty.</P>
<P>The Apoplexy is either accidental, coming of a &s;udden, and falling indifferently upon any Man, tho' not at all pre-di&s;pos'd thereto, for which by the way, no Preventative Method can be in&s;titu|ted; or it is habitual, from a con&s;tant Di&s;po&s;ition in &s;ome People, becau&s;e of which they are at fir&s;t only exerci&s;ed with light approaches thereof, or rather Symptoms; afterwards the Paroxy&s;ms are evident, but gentle; but at length they become more obvious and grievous, and of which at la&s;t they for the mo&s;t part dye.</P>
<P>The Apoplexy is di&s;tingui&s;h'd according to its Degrees, into Gentle, Strong and Stronge&s;t: The Gentle, is that wherein the Patient breathes free|ly, and ea&s;ily becomes &s;en&s;ible again. The Strong. Apoplexy is that wherein the Patient breathes with very great Difficulty, and, as it were, with Violence, Snorting and Foaming at the Mouth. The Stronge&s;t and mo&s;t Dangerous, is that in which all Sen&s;e and Motion immediately cea&s;e throughout the whole Body, the Breath al&s;o being &s;top'd. In this there is neither Snorting nor Foaming, but the Patients lye as if perfectly Dead; but if they do not quickly recover, they ought not to be buried
<PB N="26" REF="32">before Three Days be over, it having been known that &s;ome &s;o &s;eized have in that &s;pace of Time re|viv'd again.</P>
<P>The Signs of an Apoplexy are Swoonings, &s;ome|times falling Suddenly and &s;ometimes by Degrees, Sen&s;e, Motion, and Voice, being many times ta|ken away, &s;ometimes only dimini&s;h'd, Re&s;piration alone, and that with much difficulty, remaining. Some Per&s;ons Sleep deeply, and, as it were, Snort or Snore; the loo&s;en'd Limbs being lift up, fall down with their own weight, in the manner of dead Per&s;ons, and their Eyes are either wide open or quite &s;hut, the Pul&s;e at the &s;ame time being &s;trong and full, which has deceived many in the Progno&s;ticks of this Di&s;ea&s;e; in many there is a Relaxation of the Sphincter Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Anus</HI> and Bladder, &s;o that the Excrements and Urine come away invo|luntarily and in&s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>An Apoplexy very &s;eldom gives any Warning of its approach, unle&s;s in Per&s;ons &s;ubject to Lethar|gies or Vertigoes, which in many are Fore-runners of this Di&s;ea&s;e, as al&s;o, in &s;ome, are Dimne&s;s of Sight, Trembling of the whole Body, Incubus or Night-mare often afflicting, gna&s;hing of the Teeth in &s;leep, and an unu&s;al Heavine&s;s of the Body. It has likewi&s;e by many been ob&s;erved, that &s;moak|ing much Tobacco, has cau&s;ed in &s;ome Con&s;titu|tions, the Apoplexy, and they give In&s;tances of &s;uch being &s;eized while they have been &s;moaking, and dyed; and this they a&s;cribe to its Narcotick Quality, and &s;ay by that means it is Injurious to the Brain, and con&s;equently di&s;po&s;es to Apoplexies: But I am of another Opinion as to the thing in ge|neral; for if Tobacco had &s;uch a pernicious Quali|ty, the many Years it has been in Vogue, and the
<PB N="27" REF="33">Multitudes of People of all &s;orts that have taken it, would have di&s;covered it in an eminent Degree, and have oblig'd the World to leave &s;moaking it long ago as deleterious. But on the contrary, very ma|ny People live to a great Age, and in as good a State of Health, tho' they have long and immode|rately u&s;ed it, as tho&s;e that take it not. It mu&s;t in|deed be allowed that it is not agreeable to all Con|&s;titutions, but the &s;ame may be &s;aid of almo&s;t every thing el&s;e, whether Food or Phy&s;ick; and tho' we have had In&s;tances of &s;ome dying of Apoplexies that have taken Tobacco, yet it does not follow, that Tobacco was the Cau&s;e. And I pre&s;ume no wi&s;e Man will conclude from a few In&s;tances of the di&s;|agreeablene&s;s of any one thing to &s;ome Men, when va&s;t Numbers of them on the contrary &s;ide may be brought to warrant its U&s;e, that it ought univer|&s;ally to be avoided, or branded with a note of In|famy. My Sen&s;e of Tobacco is, That in tho&s;e Per|&s;ons with whom it is found to agree, 'tis a very good Drainer of Humours, and &s;o may &s;upply the place of I&s;&s;ues, or at lea&s;t that fewer of them may be nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who abound with Moi|&s;ture; for by its irritating, and occa&s;ionally enlarging (from the great Afflux of the <HI>Saliva</HI>) the Secretory Ducts of the Glandules about the Mouth, as 'tis e|vident there mu&s;t be a great Di&s;charge, &s;o a great Diver&s;ion is made from the Brain (tho' I allow the greate&s;t part of the Matter comes not immediately from thence, but out of the Blood) whence 'tis ad|vi&s;eable that the Per&s;ons who take it, &s;hould drink but moderately, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e they do them&s;elves more Hurt by the Supply, than they can receive Be|nefit by the Di&s;charge. But there is another rea&s;on why Tobacco may be u&s;eful to tho&s;e who are di&s;pos'd or &s;ubject to Apoplexies, I mean to tho&s;e to whom
<PB N="28" REF="34">it is agreeable) and that is by the Vellication the Smoke of it impre&s;&s;es on the Nerves of the Mouth, which it makes to contract, &s;o that by con&s;ent of Parts the whole Brain is analogou&s;ly affected, where|by if the Brain happens to be more lax than ordi|nary, and is dispos'd to receive a Flux of Blood or Serum, as it will be after a Per&s;on has had and e|&s;caped one Fit, it will prove a very u&s;eful Admi|ni&s;tration towards re&s;toring the Tone of it, and thereby preventing the Admi&s;&s;ion of Heterogenous Particles into the Tubes of the Nerves, which cau&s;e the Symptoms.</P>
<P>And &s;ince I have &s;poken about Tobacco, I will add a Word or Two concerning Snuff, which, as it cau&s;es not, through its frequent U&s;e, any Sternu|tation or &s;neezing, to tho&s;e who take it con&s;tantly, is very prejudicial; and where immoderately taken, by &s;ome Per&s;ons of &s;ome Con&s;titutions, &s;o relaxes the Tone of the Brain, as to di&s;po&s;e to Apoplexies, and that becau&s;e the Matter of it is gro&s;s, and apt to lye long about the Extremities of the Olfactory Nerves, &s;o as continually to affect them, e&s;pecially where they are ever and anon &s;upply'd with more, which keeps the Pores of tho&s;e Nerves continually open. It is the Opinion of a very great Phy&s;ician, That Snuff, as now a days u&s;ed, renders tho&s;e Per|&s;ons that take it, liable not only to Apoplexies, but al&s;o to the Danger of receiving the Pe&s;tilence, if any &s;uch Di&s;temper &s;hould reign, (which God for|bid) and that much &s;ooner than others, &s;ince from the Symptoms, the Pe&s;tilence appears to &s;eize the Brain particularly; and the &s;udden Fate upon Re|cord of tho&s;e that without any preceding Indi&s;po|fition have, whil&s;t the la&s;t Sickne&s;s raged, fallen down in the Streets, was doubtle&s;s from the Pe&s;ti|lential Mia&s;ms, being ea&s;ily and at once admitted
<PB N="29" REF="35">into the Brain by the Olfactory or Smelling Nerves, render'd more open and lax by the profu&s;e taking of Snuff in tho&s;e Days; tho&s;e People that u&s;ed it mo&s;t, being the &s;oone&s;t and in the mo&s;t fatal manner, &s;eized with that Di&s;ea&s;e. It may here be urged, that many, who then u&s;ed it, received no apparent Injury, or do tho&s;e that take it now a-days find any harm by it: Be it &s;o, I think the Objection may as well be urged in favour of immoderate Drinking, many who long indulg'd them&s;elves in that practice, having yet liv'd to a great Age, when however it is evident that many more have much &s;hortened their Lives by it. But tho' Pe&s;tilencies, (from which Thanks be to God we are at pre&s;ent free) or Apoplexies may not be occa&s;ion'd by the profu&s;e taking of Snuff, yet the Vertigo and other Di&s;tempers which we find debilitate or hurt the Brain, may rea&s;onably be &s;uppos'd from that pra|ctice principally to ari&s;e.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;es of the Apoplexy we have accounted for, and al&s;o the Signs: I &s;hall now &s;peak of its Seat, and then of its Prevention and Cure. The Seat of an Apoplexy is without doubt in the more inward rece&s;s of the Brain, to wit, the <HI>Corpus Cal|lo&s;um,</HI> and the proximate and immediate Subject of the Di&s;ea&s;e, is the Animal Spirits inhabiting therein, for that the Under&s;tanding, Imagination and com|mon Sen&s;e are &s;o deeply affected as to be perfectly darken'd, and to &s;uffer a total eclip&s;e; but the im|mediate Subject of this Di&s;affection is thought to be the middle part of the Brain; becau&s;e from, thence the In&s;tincts of all Spontaneous Motions proceed, and in this the Perception of all &s;en&s;ible things are terminated.</P>
<P>From Hi&s;tories and Anatomical Ob&s;ervations of Per&s;ons dying of an Apoplexy, Blood has been
<PB N="30" REF="36">found extrava&s;ated, or out of its proper Ve&s;&s;els, here and there hi great Clots, compre&s;&s;ing the Sub&s;tance of the Brain. In others the <HI>Serous Colluvies</HI> have overflow'd the whole Head. In others a large Bladder of Water has been found in one of the Ventricles, compre&s;&s;ing the &s;maller Pa&s;&s;ages; from which Ob&s;ervations it may be concluded, that the principal places &s;orely affected are not the greater Ventricles, but the middle marrowy Sub&s;tance of the Brain and Cerebel, which is every where Porus and endued with very many minute Pa&s;&s;ages, that both the Vital Spirits may flow in thi|ther from the Blood, and the Animal Spirits may flow forth.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Apoplexy is twofold, in the Fit, or out of the Fit; the Cure out of the Fit, is properly &s;peaking preventative, of which I &s;hall treat after I have &s;hewn what is to be done in the Fit.</P>
<P>The Patient being in a Fit, whether it proceeds from the Blood let out of the Ve&s;&s;els, or a Serous or watery Humour, or the breaking of an Impo&s;thume in the Brain, or other invi&s;ible Cau&s;e, the Cure mu&s;t not be the le&s;s neglected; therefore immediately &s;et the Patient as upright as may be, for &s;ome Hours, (for the Di&s;ea&s;e being a &s;leepy one, if the Patient &s;hould be put to Bed it might incline more to &s;leep, which is expre&s;ly again&s;t the Intention of Cure) and let him Blood plen|tifully, for nothing is more capable of &s;ooner relieving, and this Di&s;temper of all others, requires the mo&s;t &s;ud|den Remedy, for the Di&s;ention both of the San|guiferous Ve&s;&s;els, and Habit of the Parts, being thro' Bleeding remov'd, the Fibres which con&s;titute both, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to contract them&s;elves by their Tonick Motion, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the Habit. Afterwards, or while this is doing, &s;ome proper Ster|nutatory mu&s;t be blown up the No&s;trils with a Quil, the be&s;t of which I ever knew in&s;tantly to bring the
<PB N="31" REF="37">Patient to him&s;elf being my following Apoplectick Species, the Virtues of which in one particular Ca&s;e I will here give you.</P>
<P>A Gentleman being &s;eized with an Apoplectick Fit, &s;everal Phy&s;icians and Surgeons were call'd by the By-&s;tanders, they all immediately endeavoured to let him Blood, but he would not Bleed, at length &s;ome one by, who knew I had Medicines for Fits and Di&s;tempers of the Head, came for me, and told me the Man was dead; if &s;o, I &s;aid, I could not &s;etch him to Life; but, it being the common &s;aying when there is danger, that the Patient is either dead or; dying, in hopes the Me&s;&s;enger might be mi&s;taken, away I went, taking with me a little of my Apople|ctick Species. When I got thither I beheld the mi|&s;erable Object as one dead indeed, he lying &s;o very &s;tupified, as that no Life could be perceived to be in him, and as a dead Man I look'd upon him. Bleed I found he would not, nor could any thing be got down his Throat, therefore I in&s;tantly blew a little of my Species forcibly up his No&s;trils, by which means he a little while after began to &s;tir, I then blew up a little more, upon which a large Evacuation of Pus, Water, and Vi&s;cous Matter mix'd with Blood, was immediately made, whereupon he a little revived, and being almo&s;t come to him&s;elf, a very great Flux of Blood (near upon a Quart) pre&s;ently followed thro' his No&s;trils, &s;o that in about an Hours time or a little more, after the u&s;e of the Species, he perfectly recovered from his Fit, his Under&s;tanding, Speech and Sen&s;es being all re&s;tor'd. This Danger being over, the next thing to be con&s;idered for him was how to prevent any more Fits for the future; therefore I order'd him my Cephalick Pills and Cephalick Elixir pre&s;crib'd in Chapter the Fir&s;t, to be taken as there directed, which had the de&s;ir'd effect.</P>

<P>As the Recovering a Patient out of a Fit of the Apoplexy, when there is &s;o much Danger, and Life is &s;o imminently threaten'd, is a very happy thing, &s;o to prevent the Fits for the future, or &s;ecure tho&s;e from them, that have the Symptoms of them, is not a much le&s;s good Service; for we have &s;een and known many that have had one Fit after another, and each Fit more dangerous, till at length Life hath been carried away indeed, therefore tho' it be difficult to prevent the Fits, yet I per&s;uade my &s;elf, if the Patient follow the Rules I &s;hall lay down, he will not only be &s;ecured from more, while he is taking the Medicines, but will find the very Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e taken a|way &s;o effectually, that upon his de&s;i&s;ting to take them he will hear no more of his Malady.</P>
<P>Therefore let &s;uch that are &s;ubject to the Apoplexy, or in fear of that Di&s;ea&s;e, take Three of my Gepha|lick Pills every fourth or fifth Morning, which will gently purge him, calling away Humours from the Blood which infe&s;t the Brain; and tho&s;e Mornings he does not take the Pills, he is to take Ffty Drops of my Cephalick Elixir in a Gla&s;s of fair Water, or mix'd with a little Wine, if the Water be too raw for his Stomach; as al&s;o the &s;ame Do&s;e every Night going to Bed; which Elixir is a Specifick Midicine, corroborating the Head, Brain and Spirits, and keep|ing the Blood in due order. And if he finds any di&s;po&s;i|tion to a Fit, by any of the Signs or Symptoms, men|tioned to attend Apoplexies, he &s;hould once a Week &s;nuff up into each No&s;tril the quantity of a very &s;mall white Pea of my Apoplectick Species afore-mentioned, at Night an Hour or two before he goes to Bed which will purge the Head and Brain, and di&s;charge from the No&s;trils and Mouth a large quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Pal&s;y and other Nervous Di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pal&s;y is a Re&s;olution or Relaxation of the Nerves from their due Habit, by which means Motion and Sen&s;e, &s;ometimes one only, &s;ometimes both together, in the whole Body, or in &s;ome Part or Parts thereof, cannot be u&s;ed or exerci&s;ed after their due manner.</P>
<P>It is a Di&s;ea&s;e either perfect, in which Sen&s;e and Motion are quite lo&s;t and gone, or imperfect, where|in Sen&s;e or Motion are only decay'd or dimini&s;h'd, &s;o as to occa&s;ion a Trembling or Shaking of the Parts affected, and in this latter, if the Diminution be but &s;mall, it cannot be properly call'd a Pal&s;y, but a <HI>Stupor</HI> or a Numbne&s;s, which however is commonly the Fore-runner of a true Pal&s;y.</P>
<P>A Pal&s;y may be either from the hurt of the Mo|tive Faculty, the Sen&s;e remaining &s;ound, or from the hurt of the Sen&s;itive, the Motive remaining well. The Cau&s;e may be either from a Solution of Unity in the Nerves, as by a Brui&s;e from a Fall or Blow, or by a Wound, or from a Relaxation of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back, &s;uddenly cau&s;ed, or it may come from innate Cau&s;es, or cold pituitous Humours, which relax and
<PB N="35" REF="41">di&s;&s;olve the Tone of the Nerves, or from &s;traitne&s;s or narrowne&s;s of the Nerves cau&s;ed by Ob&s;tructions, or by Con&s;tipation from &s;ome Tumour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or from thin, &s;harp, &s;erous and windy Humours moved in the Bowels, not only to the beginning of the Orifices of the Nerves, but to the very Mu&s;cles and Tendons; or it may proceed from Cau&s;es external and foreign, as from Narcoticks, or Poi&s;ons, immea&s;urably drink|ing &s;trong Liquors, the taking of Henbane, Opium, Quick&s;ilver, Antimony, Ar&s;nick, or the like. To the external Cau&s;es may al&s;o be added the exce&s;s of Heat or Cold; by the fir&s;t of which the Spirits are wa&s;ted and &s;pent, and by the latter they are ob&s;tructed in their Pa&s;&s;ages by Congelation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or it comes by Con&s;ent of Parts, and that for the mo&s;t Part in Scor|butick Habits of Body, but the general Cau&s;es of a Pal&s;y, are all tho&s;e which hinder the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Animal Spirits into the Nerves and Mu&s;cles, and in whatever part they are interrupted from flowing, there will be a Pal&s;y in that Part, it being impo&s;&s;ible for the Nerves to act or perform their Function as they ought, without being &s;ufficiently fill'd and in|vigorated by the Spirits.</P>
<P>In whatever place, I &s;ay, this Hindrance happens, whether about the Spinal Marrow, or about the Con|jugations or Branches of the Nerves proceeding there|from, it cau&s;es a Pal&s;y either of more or fewer Parts, according as the Nerves affected are more general or particular.</P>
<P>If the Nerves that take their ri&s;e near the Brain, or in the beginning of their Pa&s;&s;age from the Brain, or the &s;pinal Marrow lying ju&s;t under the Brain, be hurt or affected, there is commonly a ge|neral Pal&s;y, wherein al&s;o Breathing, the Voice, Speech, and Swallowing with &s;ome excre&s;&s;ive Motions do &s;uffer hurt. But if the Hurt is in the following Pro|duction
<PB N="36" REF="42">of this Marrow, it makes tho&s;e Members only paralytick, into which its Branches or Nerves are in&s;erted: But the Pal&s;y is &s;o much the more general by how much the effect of the &s;aid &s;pinal Marrow is near to the Brain, or Original of the Nerves.</P>
<P>If the Eye be affected with the Pal&s;y, the vi&s;ive Nerves are originally hurt, as al&s;o the <HI>Cerebrum</HI> it &s;elf. If the Tongue is Paralytick, the Conjugation of Nerves &s;erving the Tongue is hurt, and the Speech is al&s;o defective, and by rea&s;on of its Community with the Auditory Nerve, if the defect be &s;o great as to cau&s;e a Total lo&s;s of Speech, the Patient is for the mo&s;t part Deaf al&s;o. If there be a Pal&s;y of the Larynx, Jaws, Midriff, as al&s;o of the Bladder and Fundament, the Nerves of the &s;ixth and &s;eventh Conjugations, are hurt about their Original. If there be a defect of the Voice, the Recurrent Nerve is affected. If there be a defect in Swallowing, the Nerves that go to the Mu&s;cles of the Jaws are hurt; if there be danger of Suffocation, the Nerves that go to the Midriff are hurt, tho' the Midriff (the In&s;tru|ment of Breathing) can otherwi&s;e, in &s;ome &s;ort, per|form its Office, for that it receives Nerves al&s;o from the Spinal Marrow.</P>
<P>If the Sphincter Mu&s;cles of the Bladder and Anus be paralytick, there follows an involuntary voiding of Urine and the Excrements, the Conju|gations of Nerves &s;upplying tho&s;e Parts, being gene|rally affected or hurt.</P>
<P>If the Pal&s;y is in the Legs, the Nerves affected are about the bottom of the Spinal Marrow, and the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the <HI>Os Sacrum.</HI> And thus we mu&s;t &s;earch out for the place whence the Nerves &s;pring, which are di&s;per&s;ed to tho&s;e Parts affected with the Pal&s;y, and that being known, the Cure is the ea&s;ier accom|pli&s;hed. From the&s;e things it is apparent what Con|jugation
<PB N="37" REF="43">of Nerves are mo&s;t affected, when the Pal&s;y is in this or that Part only; but when there is an univer&s;al Pal&s;y, there is, for the mo&s;t part, an Af|fection of the whole <HI>Genus Nervo&s;um</HI> or Nervous Sy&s;tem, which comes to pa&s;s from one or more of the Cau&s;es already mentioned.</P>
<P>The Signs of the Pal&s;y are manife&s;t, to wit, De|privation of Sen&s;e and Motion of the Parts; the Eye, if that be affected, is weakned and depraved on that &s;ide where the Part is affected for want of Nouri&s;h|ment; the Speech is much alter'd; the Urine is mo&s;t times white and thin by means of Ob&s;tructions. If it comes from a Blow, Fall, Wound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or upon an Apoplexy, Lethargy, Carus, or other Effects of the Brain or <HI>Genus Nervo&s;um,</HI> it will not quickly be cured; no more will the Pal&s;y in young People pro|ceeding from a cold and moi&s;t matter, becau&s;e of the di&s;&s;imilitude of the Di&s;ea&s;e to the Nature of &s;uch Pa|tients. The Pal&s;y in old People is never perfectly cured, becau&s;e they want Natural Heat; and an in|veterate Pal&s;y is mo&s;t commonly incurable.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Pal&s;y therefore is uncertain, ac|cording as is the Cau&s;e and Strength of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and Con&s;titution of the Patient; nor is it in any cured but by fir&s;t and chiefly altering the whole habit of the Body, rectifying the di&s;cracy of the Blood, and removing the Morbifick Matter offending, and that at la&s;t by &s;trengthening the Parts hurt, that they may for the future be able to re&s;i&s;t all other A&s;&s;aults of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To do this, Medicines mu&s;t be both inwardly ta|ken and outwardly apply'd. Authors have not been &s;paring in their Pre&s;criptions for that purpo&s;e, there being numbers of them to be met with; but it is to be doubted many of them would be found to be of very little, if any, effect; I have known many of
<PB N="38" REF="44">the (reputed) celebrated ones made u&s;e of, but the Benefit was not equivalent to the Trouble, nor in|deed can I &s;ay any one of the many I have met with, have come near an&s;wering their Characters, tho' I my &s;elf have u&s;ed them with the &s;tricte&s;t Care and Ob&s;ervation, which put me upon con&s;idering how to find out tho&s;e that might be effectual, and which I have accompli&s;h'd &s;o far, as to cure in many Ca&s;es of that kind, I might &s;ay mo&s;t; and even in invete|rate Pal&s;ies, by a con&s;tant Application of tho&s;e Me|dicines, I know not what effects may be produced, it may be more than I am willing to &s;ay, or the Pa|tient expect.</P>

<P>By the Volatile and Operative Quality of the Drink and Elixir, a &s;peedy flowing of the Spirits will be let into the <HI>Genus Nervo&s;um,</HI> for they not only al|ter the Blood and Juices of the whole Body, but al&s;o remove the offending Cau&s;e, circulate the Spirits, and give Strength, and that as well in all manner of Di|&s;ea&s;es of the Nerves, as in the Pal&s;y, and with that good effect, that 'tis believed no Medicines can do more.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Epilep&s;y or Falling-Sickne&s;s, al&s;o Convul&s;ions and Cramp.</HEAD>
<P>THE Epilep&s;y or Falling-Sickne&s;s, is a Con|vul&s;ive Motion of the whole Body, coming by Fits, depriving the Sick &s;uddenly both of Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e, wherein the whole Body is contracted. <HI>Galen</HI> calls the Falling-Sickne&s;s always a Convul&s;ion, but improperly, for it is not a true Convul&s;ion, but a Convul&s;ive Motion of the whole Body, wherein all the External and Internal Sen&s;es are aboli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>It is call'd the Falling-Sickne&s;s, becau&s;e many times the Per&s;ons afflicted, fall down when their Fits come upon them; it is al&s;o call'd <HI>Morbus Sacer,</HI> either becau&s;e it doth contaminate, as it were, the Sacred Soul or Life, or becau&s;e it is &s;eated in the Head, the Sacred Temple of the Soul, as Philo&s;o|phers &s;ay, or el&s;e call'd &s;o from the Greatne&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e, or rather becau&s;e it is a Di&s;ea&s;e not often cured (if it be inveterate) by Humane Help, but by Divine Aid. It is al&s;o by Authors call'd <HI>Morbus Herculeus,</HI> and that either becau&s;e <HI>Hercules,</HI> as the Poets feign, was taken with this Di&s;temper, or be|cau&s;e it is hard, like his Labours, and difficult to cure. Others call it <HI>Morbus Puerilis,</HI> becau&s;e Chil|dren when they begin to have Teeth, are often &s;eized with this Di&s;ea&s;e, al&s;o <HI>Morbus Comitialis,</HI> be|cau&s;e it takes Men on a &s;udden when they are in
<PB N="42" REF="48">Company; al&s;o <HI>Morbus Lunaticus,</HI> becau&s;e People are generally &s;eized with it, at certain times of the Moon, as the New and Full; likewi&s;e <HI>Morbus Sonticus,</HI> becau&s;e it is a Di&s;temper that much afflicts and hurts the Per&s;on who has it.</P>
<P>When the Fit comes, the Patient falls down, is plucked up together, trembles, turns about, &s;norts, crys out, and foams at the Mouth, and makes a kind of roaring or howling Noi&s;e, cla&s;hing or gra|ting and clo&s;ing his Teeth, fa&s;t &s;hutting and holding together his Fingers, voiding his Urine and Excre|ments in&s;en&s;ibly, and foaming at Mouth froth, like the White of an Egg work'd with a Wisk.</P>
<P>It is cau&s;ed of gro&s;s Flegm, or &s;harp Choler, ob|&s;tructing the Pa&s;&s;age of the Spirits in the Ventricles of the Brain, which within pulls or twinges the prin|cipal Nerves, and thereby cau&s;es a &s;traitning of the Pa&s;&s;age, by which there follows a drawing back and &s;hutting up of the Animal Spirits which cau&s;e Sen&s;e; from defect of which there follows immedi|ately all the Symptoms of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and by which the Parts &s;uffer a Convul&s;ive Motion.</P>
<P>Tho' what has been &s;aid to be the Cau&s;e, yet there are many afflicted with this Di&s;ea&s;e Heredita|rily, from the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;y Principle in their Parents, &s;o that they bring it into the World with them; but upon general Ob&s;ervation it is a Di&s;ea&s;e chiefly oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome Po&s;terous Accident.</P>
<P>There are differences of this Di&s;ea&s;e according to its Cau&s;e, and the Con&s;titution it &s;eizes on. One is recent, or but newly begun, the other inveterate and of long &s;tanding. There is al&s;o another more mild, in which &s;ome certain Parts &s;uffer only a Convul&s;ion; or el&s;e more grievous, wherein there is a Convul&s;ion of the whole Body. Another is periodical, coming once or twice a Year or once or twice a Month, at New
<PB N="43" REF="49">or full Moon, or oftner, but always keeping its certain times, tho' others again I have known to be &s;urpriz'd with the Fits unawares.</P>
<P>It is a Di&s;ea&s;e to &s;ome, from an Epileptick Di&s;po|&s;ition in the Brain, to others from a preceding Cau&s;e in the inferior Parts, to others from Di&s;tempers of the Stomach, to others from Worms, to others from the Womb, and to others from hurts of the exter|nal Parts; it never &s;eizes &s;ome till they are grown up in Years, and others never but in their Infancy; but tho' it mo&s;t commonly happens to Children, yet it &s;ometimes afflicts grown Per&s;ons, and it is remark'd by <HI>Galen</HI> to be a Di&s;ea&s;e incurable if it takes them after the Age of Twenty five Years.</P>
<P>The Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e is twofold, when the Di|&s;ea&s;e is upon them, and when the Fit is over.</P>
<P>When the Fit is upon them, Authors advi&s;e to give a few Drops of Spirit of Hartshorn, Ca&s;tor, or the like, in a Gla&s;s of fair Water, and to &s;mell to the &s;ame, rubbing the No&s;trils a little with it, or with Oil of Amber. And when the Fit is over, to pre|vent it for the future, they order Bli&s;ters, Gli&s;ters, Purges, Vomits, Cuppings, and the like, and give Specificks inwardly, which they pre&s;cribe, but they are &s;o numerous that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the bre|vity I de&s;ign in this Treati&s;e, to note them, as 'tis judg'd they would, many of them at lea&s;t, be as in|&s;ignificant if I did.</P>
<P>I have attended many Patients in my time both in and out of the Fits, and tho' I have u&s;ed many things recommended, I could not find any thing come near my Epileptick Spirit following, both to recover Pa|tients when in Fits, and to rectify the Indi&s;po&s;ition of the Parts in order to prevent them for the future. But the Method I u&s;e when I &s;ee any one in a Fit, is this, I immediately blow a little of my Apoplectick
<PB N="44" REF="50">Species, pre&s;crib'd in Chapter the 8th, up each No&s;tril, and give inwardly a few Drops of the Epileptick Spi|rit, as Thirty to a grown Per&s;on, and Five or Six to Children, in a Gla&s;s of fair Water, rubbing the No|&s;trils, Temples, top of the Head and Nape of the Neck with a little of the Spirit al&s;o, which almo&s;t In|&s;tantly, as &s;oon as the Species begin to operate, brings the Patient out of the Fit. After that is done, to pre|vent the Fits for the future, I fir&s;t purge the Patient with my Cephalick Pills pre&s;crib'd in the 1&s;t Chapter, giving them, as there directed, according to Age or Strength, every third or fourth Day; and in the in|termediate days, I give Thirty, Forty or Fifty Drops of my Epileptick Spirit, every Night and Morning in a Gla&s;s of fair Water, which is the be&s;t Vehicle; and order the top of the Head, Nape of the Neck, Tem|ples and Back-bone, to be rubb'd with my <HI>Nerve Fo|tus,</HI> pre&s;crib'd in the 9th Chapter, every Night and Morning, which wonderfully corrects and alters the Humours of the Body, and &s;trengthens the whole Man, e&s;pecially if the cour&s;e be continued for &s;ome time after the time the Fits u&s;ually return, and I be|lieve &s;carce One Patient in Twenty, where the Di&s;ea&s;e is not Hereditary, will by this Method ever fail of being cured.</P>

<P>The like good Service will the&s;e Medicines I have now mentioned do in Convul&s;ions, which is a Di|&s;ea&s;e from a forced Contraction of the Nerves and Mu&s;cles towards their Original, which is the Brain and Spinal Marrow, wherein the voluntary Motion of the Joints is hurt, the natural form and &s;ituation is deprav'd or changed, and the Parts affected are annoyed with a mo&s;t &s;harp Pain.</P>
<P>There are Four kinds of Convul&s;ions, one when the whole Body is bended or drawn forward, another when the whole Body is convul&s;ed and drawn back|ward, another when the Convul&s;ion is equally both ways, &s;o that the whole Body is &s;tiff like a Stake, that it cannot be moved any way, and the other is when it happens to a particular Part, as the Hands, Arms, Legs, Thighs, Hips, and &s;ometimes remarka|ble when it happens to the Bowels, Stomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When it happens to the Hands, Arms, Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is what is call'd the Cramp.</P>
<P>The Brain is oftentimes affected in this Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes the Marrow of the Back or <HI>Spina Medullae,</HI> as al&s;o the Nerves and Mu&s;cles as &s;aid before.
<PB N="46" REF="52">The Signs are manife&s;t, and the Cau&s;es many, as from Wounds, lo&s;s of much Blood, cold Humours, Flegm, the taking of Hellebore, Drunkenne&s;s, Sur|feiting, pricking a Nerve or Tendon, Worms, biting of venemous Bea&s;ts, or the like. But be the Cau&s;e from what it will, I could never find the Cure bet|ter or &s;ooner accompli&s;h'd than by the Method and Medicines a little before mentioned and pre&s;cribed, which if followed as directed for the Falling-Sickne&s;s, an&s;wers the Intention &s;o much, as I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay nothing can do more.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Incubus or Night-Mare.</HEAD>
<P>THE Night-mare, or, as &s;ome call it, the Hag, is a Nocturnal Di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;ing from thick Va|pours which chiefly ob&s;truct the hinder part of the Brain, by which the Flux of Animal Spirits being &s;top'd, Breathing is hindred, the Voice intercepted, and the Body &s;o oppre&s;s'd (as it were between &s;leep|ing and waking) with a weight lying upon the Brea&s;t and holding fa&s;t the Man, that, notwith&s;tanding all his Endeavours, the whole Faculty of moving &s;eems for a &s;ea&s;on to be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, in the time of the Fit, the Patient endea|vours and &s;trives with vehemency to &s;tir, move, and &s;hake off his Burden, but in vain; for when the Fit is off, and he comes to him&s;elf, he find's he is not moved an Hair's breadth, but lyes in the &s;ame Place and Po&s;ture, tho' he thought he &s;truggled &s;trongly with what oppre&s;s'd him, and that he cry'd out, when indeed
<PB N="47" REF="53">he never &s;poke one Word; but becau&s;e of the great Oppre&s;&s;ion about the Heart and Midriff, and fear of Suffocation, he commonly groans, and thereby ex|pre&s;&s;es the Weight of his Affliction with Fear and Terror. And tho' this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;o &s;trongly &s;eizes the univer&s;al Man in the Fit, as to aboli&s;h all manner of external Motion, yet it hurts the Under&s;tanding and internal Sen&s;es but little, nor indeed the common Sen&s;e of Feeling, becau&s;e if any one, being by, does but touch or pull the Patient, tho he be in the heighth of the Fit, he will immediately come to him|&s;elf, and perfectly remember and tell all the Circum|&s;tances of the Affliction.</P>
<P>As from the great oppre&s;&s;ion the Patient groans, &s;o al&s;o are the inward Sen&s;es of many &s;o di&s;turb'd, as that they believe it was a Spirit that held them, or that they were hag-ridden (whence comes the Name) or that &s;ome Witch or Devil, &s;ometimes in one Shape, &s;ometimes in another, as of a Dog, a Cat, Bear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> lyes upon and oppre&s;&s;es them, and will po&s;&s;itively tell you, and them&s;elves verily believe it, that they &s;truck the Devil or Witch, when at the &s;ame time they never &s;tirr'd their Hands or Arms, as afore&s;aid, an Hair's breadth from the Place.</P>

<P>The Indications of the Cure of this Di&s;temper are threefold: Fir&s;t the Humour or Matter that interrupts the Flux of the Animal Spirits is to be removed, which is done by proper evacuating Medicines. Secondly, the di&s;cra&s;y of the Blood is to be rectified and re|duced to its pre&s;tine &s;tate of Health, which is done by Specifick and Alterative Medicines. Thirdly, the Parts affected and weaken'd by the Force of the Morbifick Matter, are to be &s;trengthen'd; to do which, the &s;ame Order and Method, and the &s;ame Medica|ments that I have recommended in the la&s;t Chapter, for the Cure of the Falling Sickne&s;s, are mo&s;t proper, tho' truly, Medicines le&s;s in Power and Virtue than they are endued with, might in this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;erve the turn; tho' I cannot but &s;ay as they are the mo&s;t powerful, &s;o they are more certain and &s;peedy in their Operation, and le&s;s of them than others will &s;uffice to compleat the Cure.

<P>A Catarrh or Defluxion, or as &s;ome call it, a Di|&s;tillation, is a flowing of &s;ome Excrementitious Humours from the Brain to the lower Parts, as to the Eyes, No&s;e, Mouth, Palate, Throat, Lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that the Brain is chiefly affected, the concoctive Faculty of it being hurt, or the expul&s;ive Faculty irritated and &s;tirred up, from an abundant Repletion
<PB N="49" REF="55">of Flegmatick Rheum, either generated in the Brain from the hurt of the concoctive Faculty, or through the fault of the Brain it &s;elf.</P>
<P>There are many kinds of tho&s;e Rheums, &s;ome more thick, others more thin, &s;ome acrid and &s;alt, others more &s;weet, &s;ome flow more violently, others more &s;lowly. If it be hot, 'tis &s;harp and thin, flowing by the No&s;e and Mouth, the Forehead and Face are hot, and the No&s;e many times &s;wells. If it be cold, there is a Pain and Dulne&s;s of the Head; the Humour that floweth down is not &s;harp or pricking, but the Patient is drow&s;y, his Eyes dazle, his Hear|ing thick, his No&s;trils &s;top'd, all his Sen&s;es dull, his Eyes and his whole Body heavy and lumpi&s;h, and each of the&s;e is more or le&s;s, as the Humour falleth more or le&s;s upon that Part: If the Rheum falls upon the Eyes, they look red, &s;well'd and &s;ore, da|maging the Sight if not &s;oon cured; if upon the No&s;e, there is Stoppage of the No&s;trils, lo&s;s of Smell|ing, and the No&s;trils are &s;ore, by the &s;harpne&s;s of the Humour, and violent Sneezings follow; if it falls upon the Ears, it cau&s;es Pain in them, Deafne&s;s, and oftentimes Impo&s;thumes; if it de&s;cends upon the Pa|late, it cau&s;es Inflammation of it, Relaxation of the <HI>&V;vula</HI> (which old Women call the falling down of the Palate) Swelling and Sorene&s;s, al&s;o hurt of the Ta&s;te; if the Rheum falls upon the Throat, it cau&s;es Inflammation and Swelling of the Glandules (vulgarly call'd the Almonds of the Ears, and deem'd their falling down) and hinders Swallowing, &s;o that no|thing can be got down but with very great diffi|culty; if the Rheum ru&s;hes down upon the Lungs, it cau&s;es, if it be &s;harp and violent, a dangerous Suf|focation, or at lea&s;t an Ob&s;truction of the Lungs, from whence often en&s;ues &s;hortne&s;s of Breath, difficulty of Breathing, and a vehement Cough, which if not in

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of Melancholly; its Nature, Cau&s;e, and Cure.</HEAD>
<P>THO' Melancholly cannot be &s;trictly &s;aid to be a Di&s;ea&s;e of the Head, yet as the Head is oftentimes di&s;turbed by it, it comes properly enough to be &s;poken of here.</P>
<P>Melancholly, or as &s;ome call it, the Hippo, is a &s;ort of Dotage ari&s;ing from di&s;turbd Phanta&s;ms, fill|ing
<PB N="52" REF="58">the Per&s;on afflicted with anxious Thoughts and Solitarine&s;s, being, as it were, ingulphed therein, with Pen&s;ivene&s;s, Fury, or Fever; &s;ome are afflict|ed with a deep Sadne&s;s or Pen&s;ivene&s;s, without ap|parent Cau&s;e, and a long continued Silence, or el&s;e an incongruous Talk at random of &s;ome particular Thing. It is cau&s;ed by a Di&s;temper of the Animal Spirits, hurt by a Malancholly Phanta&s;m or Vapour, made mi&s;ty, opacous, thick, and dark, almo&s;t fix'd and immoveable, and from thence it is that Melan|cholly People are Tenacious; for that all kinds of Objects are fix'd in their Minds, according to the Condition and Quality of the deprav'd Spirits; and this is acquired either from a default in the Brain, de|clining from its genuine Whitene&s;s, and generating &s;uch like Spirits, or from a default of the Blood and Vital Spirits, or from &s;ome degenerate Melancholly Matter, as Humour, Vapour, or both, mingled with the Blood and Spirits. If it proceeds from the Brain, it is known by Sadne&s;s, Fearfulne&s;s, Hatred, and other &s;trange Imaginations; &s;ome think them&s;elves Bea&s;ts, &s;ome one thing, &s;ome another; &s;ome would kill them&s;elves, others are afraid, &s;ome laugh, &s;ome weep, &s;ome prophecy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;hews it is from Melancholly Blood.</P>
<P>The Species or Kinds of Melancholly are many, as fir&s;t, that of the Brain, when it declines in Quality or Sub&s;tance from its Purity and Cleanne&s;s, which is known by a perpetual and vehement Doting, ari&s;ing either externally, from &s;trange Fancy and Imagi|nation, as from Fear, Di&s;pair, and &s;uch like &s;ad Af|flictions of the Mind, which dry up the radical Moi&s;ture, and cau&s;e Cares, Watchings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or inter|nally, from a Melancholly Humour gathered toge|ther in the Head, either by &s;ome cold or dry Mat|ter left behind in the Brain, after &s;ome hot Di&s;tem|per,
<PB N="53" REF="59">the thinner part of the Matter being re&s;olv'd and gone; or from a Melancholly Habit and Con&s;titu|tion, either Hereditary from the Parents Blood, or from a cold and dry, or hot and dry Di&s;po&s;ition of the Body, cau&s;ing either Doting with Laughter, or a dull Slothfulne&s;s, or Anger, Di&s;content and Peevi&s;h|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> Another kind of Melancholly is that of the whole Body, the Blood having acquired a Melan|cholly Habit, di&s;tributing the &s;ame to all the Parts, and then to the Brain; this is known becau&s;e the Dotage or Delirium is indeed continual, but &s;o that it is with &s;ome Exa&s;perations and Remi&s;&s;ions, with general Signs of a Melancholly Habit.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> There is another &s;ort of that Di&s;temper, calld the Melancholly of the Heart, when the Vital Spirits that are there bred, by rea&s;on of a cold and dry Di|&s;temper, are made impure.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> There is that which is Hypochondriacal, wherein Melancholly Juice either cold and &s;erous, or adu&s;t and burnt, in the Branches of the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> is gathered together in the Hypochondria, (which occa|&s;ions the mo&s;t common &s;ort of Melancholly, from whence, time after time, black Melancholly Vapours are continually &s;ent forth to corrupt the Animal Spirits in the Brain; and this is known by its &s;eizing the Patient by Intervals and certain Sea&s;ons, but in its approach, it &s;urprizes without any Notice, except by windy Belchings and a Pain di&s;tending the Sto|mach, with Anxiety of Mind, Difficulty of Brea|thing, Palpitation of the Heart, Immoveablene&s;s of the Tongue, Mi&s;t or Darkne&s;s before the Eyes, Noi&s;e in the Ears, and a Stupidity or Benumbedne&s;s in both Arms. The&s;e Melancholly Vapours or Humours, are tran&s;mitted from the Hypochondria to the Brain, either by the Orifice of the Stomach,
<PB N="54" REF="60">as &s;ome imagine, or el&s;e by the Branches of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> where they cloud and darken the Spirits.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5thly,</HI> There is Melancholly of the Womb in Wo|men, which is di&s;covered by a Pain in the Left-&s;ide, and a manife&s;t Pul&s;e and Beating in the Back near the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> being cau&s;ed by Stoppage of the Cour&s;es, or other Natural Evacuations.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6thly,</HI> There is a Melancholly from Love, occa|&s;ioned either from Philters or Love Potions, or el&s;e from a Lu&s;tful Appetite, or De&s;ire of Venery, cau&s;ed from an hot Con&s;titution, and an over abundance of Seed; in which Ca&s;e the Fancy is not fix'd upon one Per&s;on, but the Patient by Fits delights to be in the Company of Men promi&s;cuou&s;ly, talks leudly, and is ready to call them to her, tho' before, and at other times, &s;he is very Cha&s;te and Mode&s;t.</P>
<P>But as the &s;ort of Melancholly which generally afflicts People, is that of the Hypochonders, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething more at large of its Nature, and after that of its Cau&s;e, before I come to &s;hew the Cure of it.</P>
<P>Hypochondriack Melancholly is a Collection of filthy and vicious Humours in the Branches of the <HI>Vena Porta, Caeliacal</HI> and <HI>Me&s;enterical</HI> Arteries, by rea&s;on of a Fault of the Concoction of the Spleen, without Putrifaction, thence &s;ending many Vapours, cau&s;ing imminent Symptoms. 'Tis call'd Hypo|chondriacal, becau&s;e it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the place of both Hypochonders, <HI>viz.</HI> that part of the Body, which under the Ba&s;tard or &s;hort Ribs, reaches as far as the Loins, on both &s;ides, comprehending with the Mu&s;|cles the Bowels them&s;elves, and call'd Melancholly, when the Brain is affected by Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are afflicted with Hypochondriack Me|lancholly, find a Rawne&s;s, Windine&s;s, &s;harp Belchings, Crudities, Burning, and Pain of the Stomach and Sides,
<PB N="55" REF="61">which are pluck'd upwards, and &s;ometimes inflamed; the Belly is bound, &s;leep little, and that with trou|ble&s;ome Dreams, Sadne&s;s, given to be Thoughtful, Idle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are the general Symptoms, but the more particular ones, which People afflicted find more or le&s;s, according as they are of Con&s;titution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are ranged as follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Crudity of the Stomach, &s;o &s;ower &s;ometimes as to &s;et the Teeth an Edge.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Pains in the Stomach, reaching even to the Back, and returning upon Eating,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Co&s;tivene&s;s of Body, from an univer&s;al Me|lancholly Habit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. An Inflammation of the Hypochonders, attended with Redne&s;s of the Cheeks, and &s;udden Flu&s;hings in the Face.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Urine &s;ometimes thin and pale like Water, and &s;ometimes thick and troubled with now and then a Sediment of red Sand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. A Motion of Wind in the left Hypochonder cau&s;ing great Pain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Anxiety, cau&s;ed by Wind di&s;tending the Hypochonders, thereby cau&s;ing a &s;traitne&s;s in tho&s;e Parts, which have Nerves from the &s;ixth Conjuga|tion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. A Palpitation of the Heart, either from the Malignity of the Vapours in the Part, or by Con&s;ent of the Stomach.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. A beating in the Left Hypochonder, cau&s;ed either by the great Pul&s;ation of the <HI>Caeliacal</HI> Branch of the Arteries after Anger or violent Motion, or by the Compre&s;&s;ion of the Arteries in the <HI>Me&s;entery,</HI> by the Glandules being more than ordinarily extended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. A Dryne&s;s in the Mouth, Tongue and Palate, by rea&s;on of hot Vapours a&s;cending through the Gullet and rough Artery.</ITEM>
<PB N="56" REF="62">
<ITEM>XI. A Difficulty of Breathing, both by rea&s;on of the Affection of the Nerves dedicated to the Mu&s;cles of the Brea&s;t, and of the Affu&s;ion of evil Matter into the Spaces of the Mu&s;cles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. A Perturbation of the Brain from Vapours re&s;olv'd, which if they be ob&s;cure they darken the Spirits, and cau&s;e Melancholly Dotage; if dry, an <HI>Epilep&s;y</HI> and Watchings; and if many, the Vertigo and a Fear of Strangling, or Stupidity.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e are the Symptoms of Hypochondriack Me|lancholly, but all of them are rarely to be &s;een in one Per&s;on, the mo&s;t certain Symptoms that always attend, are Grippings and Wind in the Bowels, a weak Stomach, and &s;ometimes a very keen one, Co|&s;tivene&s;s, Belchings, Palpitation of the Heart, Pertur|bations of the Head, and a di&s;turb'd or unea&s;y Mind.</P>
<P>The Symptoms being thus premi&s;ed, let us now inquire more particularly after their Cau&s;e. The fir&s;t Cau&s;e is a Vicious Acid in the Stomach, inlarg|ing the Appetite, but unfit for Dige&s;tion, hence en&s;ues an Acid Crudity in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, which depraves the Cra&s;is of the Blood, prevents the due &s;eparation of the Volatile Spirits; upon which the Lymphatick Juice becomes Acid, and the Bileous Juice In|active.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Sources of all the preceding Symp|toms, &s;ince Wind, Noi&s;e, Griping in the Guts, and. Co&s;tivene&s;s, are the natural Re&s;ult of a Vi&s;cous Acid in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages; as al&s;o Flu&s;hings in the Face, ari&s;ing from its Efferve&s;&s;ence with the Bile. The Convul&s;ions of the Nervous Membranes in &s;everal Parts of the Body, are the Effects of its Irritation; its Crudity impairs the due Fermentation of the Blood, and cau&s;es a Palpitation of the Heart, and difficulty in Breathing; it depraves the Nutritious Juice of the Bowels, which &s;ettles into hard Swellings, and occa|&s;ions
<PB N="57" REF="63">a Degeneracy and Au&s;terity in the Spirits; hence Fear, Melancholly, irregular Thoughts, and uncouth Emotions en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The Procatartick or remote Cau&s;es that promote Crudities, are Acid Liquors, or Salt Victuals, or &s;uch as are dried in the Smoak; both which par|take of the Acid Spirit of Salt or Soot; want of Mo|tion to promote Dige&s;tion, and the &s;peedy A&s;&s;imi|lation of Chyle; Nocturnal Study or Care; exhau&s;t|ing the Blood and rendring the Lympha Acid, which at length brings on a Nervous <HI>Atrophy;</HI> this Di&s;ea&s;e being an Enemy to the Nervous Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>So much for the Symptoms and Cau&s;es of the Hypochondriack Di&s;ea&s;e, which is generally ob&s;erv'd to happen to Scorbutick Bodies, and to People of the be&s;t Sen&s;e and good Under&s;tanding, it being &s;eldom &s;een that Fools and Blockheads are troubled with that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e is truly difficult to Cure, by rea&s;on of the mighty Heap of Symptoms that commonly at|tend Per&s;ons afflicted with it; it is &s;eldom mortal, but of very long continuance, &s;ometimes la&s;ting even the whole period of Life, for which Rea&s;on it is call'd <HI>The Di&s;grace of Phy&s;icians.</HI></P>
<P>If it be attended with continual Pain and Giddi|ne&s;s of the Head, it gives fears of the <HI>Epilep&s;y, Apo|plexy,</HI> or Blindne&s;s. If it be accompanyed with a moderate Flux of the Belly, (for it is good to be loo&s;e, bad to be co&s;tive) Vomiting, or Haemorrhoids, it is good, but if tho&s;e Fluxes continue long, it is dange|rous. Sometimes the Patient &s;eems to be cured, and then in a few Months it returns again: It is much ea&s;ier cured if taken in the beginning, and happening to People neither in a full, or declining Age; al&s;o Men are ea&s;ier cured than Women; the Fat and Fair, than the Lean and Swarthy.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="64">
<P>The Cure of this Di&s;temper con&s;i&s;ts primarily and peculiarly in opening all Ob&s;tructions in the Sto|mach, Bowels and other Pa&s;&s;ages, by which the Dige&s;tions may be perfected and good Chyle a&s;&s;imi|lated. Secondly in tempering the Evil Quality of the Humours. Thirdly in evacuating the Morbifick Matter. Fourthly in altering the Habit of the Body, and &s;trengthening the weakened Parts.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h the&s;e Four Intentions, Authors pre&s;cribe more Medicines than there are Symptoms, and which for any one to follow, would rather per|plex than profit. Some run altogether on Steel Cour&s;es, and pre&s;cribe them promi&s;cuou&s;ly to all; o|thers are much devoted to Te&s;taceous Pouders, which they call Sweetners; others again to Acids, and o|thers in oppo&s;ition to Alcalies. Some are for Volatile Salts and Spirits, others for fix'd Salts and Cardiacks; &s;ome highly applaud Emeticks, others condemn them, and cry up Catharticks; others are for Altera|tives, others for Aperitives. And thus do they vary as their Opinions or Inclinations lead them, without con&s;idering with that mature Judgment they ought, or making ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations; which is the rea&s;on &s;o few are cured, or &s;o ordinarily relieved.</P>
<P>But as the whole Cure of this Di&s;temper hinges upon the Four Points mentioned, when tho&s;e Points are maturely con&s;idered, and Medicines accordingly adapted, it is not to be doubted but the end will be accompli&s;h'd; and to &s;peak truly, I never found, where the Patient was &s;teady in the Method pre|&s;cribed him, but that in the End a Cure was ob|tained.</P>
<P>To do this, I rely upon the Two Medicines follow|ing, <HI>viz.</HI> my <HI>Hypochondriacum Dige&s;tivum,</HI> and <HI>Pul|vis Corroborans.</HI> The fir&s;t an&s;wers the Three fir&s;t Intentions of Cure, and the &s;econd the la&s;t: But as

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of Vapours or Hy&s;terick Fits; their real Cau&s;e and Cure.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I have &s;aid in the Chapter before, of Hypochondriack Melancholly, gives &s;ome Idea of the Di&s;temper I am now about to &s;peak of, tho' I am not of the Opinion of <HI>Sylvius</HI> and <HI>Willis,</HI> who alledge that the Difference between them is &s;o little, that they are taken to be one and the &s;ame. I &s;ay I am not of their Opinion, becau&s;e the &s;ame Medi|cines that Cure the one, have no effect on the other, and that becau&s;e they affect different Sexes from dif|ferent Cau&s;es, tho' I mu&s;t allow, that there is an Analogy between them in &s;ome Symptoms, and from &s;ome Cau&s;es, but yet &s;o far from being general, that it is but in &s;ome few Particulars; the Symptoms of Vapours or Hy&s;terick Di&s;ea&s;es, being incident to the Female Sex chiefly, in the manner Men cannot have them, and are &s;o numerous that a Day will &s;carce be &s;ufficient to reckon them up.</P>
<P><HI>Democritus</HI> in an Epi&s;tle to <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>That the Womb was the Cau&s;e of Six Hundred Mi&s;eries, and of innumerable Calamities,</HI> and among them reckons Hy&s;terick Fits or Vapours, whence it is plain, he concludes that they ari&s;e from a di&s;temperature of the Womb, concerning which, I &s;hall by and by &s;peak.</P>
<P>The Vapours or Hy&s;terick Fits, together with the Hypochondriack Di&s;ea&s;e, are the mo&s;t frequent of all Chronick Di&s;tempers; the Vapours few Women are wholly free from, more or le&s;s; and tho&s;e Men that lead Sedentary Lives and Study hard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are com|monly afflicted with Hypochondriack Melancholly.</P>
<P>The Vapours or Hy&s;terick Fits, are not only fre|quent to Women, but are &s;o wonderfully various,
<PB N="65" REF="71">that they re&s;emble almo&s;t all the Di&s;ea&s;es poor Mor|tals are &s;ubject to; for whatever Parts they &s;eat them&s;elves in, they pre&s;ently produce &s;uch Symptoms as belong to tho&s;e Parts when primarily affected with a real Di&s;temper: As for In&s;tance, if the Vapours &s;eize the Head, they produce &s;ome Di&s;order or other there; or if the Spirits, &s;ome violent Commotions of Mind are pre&s;ently occa&s;ioned, and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This Di&s;temper is call'd the Hy&s;terick or Uterine Pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e the Authors that fir&s;t wrote about it, thought that the Womb was principally affected in it, by rea&s;on it commonly invaded Maids, married Women, and Widows both old and young, which Opinion is not fully agreed to, tho' we can't but &s;ay it is fomented and &s;u&s;tained, by a Fault that is in the Womb, as well as the other Vi&s;cera, which the cu|ring it by Medicines adapted to the Womb demon|&s;trates, yet it principally proceeds from a Fault in the Blood and Spirits, injured by bad Humours, from Cold, ill Food, Tra&s;h, and the like, which &s;tagnating by the Patient's Sedentary or Idle Life, depraves the Blood, and gives it a bad Di&s;po&s;ition, able to produce the Hy&s;terick Pa&s;&s;ion; of which by treating we mean not one, but a whole Army of Di&s;tempers, at lea&s;t in outward &s;hew, it being a Di&s;ea&s;e that pro|duces Head-achs, Giddine&s;s, Convul&s;ive Motions Palpitations of the Heart, Rumblings and Agitations of the Stomach and Guts, Difficulty of Breathing Hickup, lo&s;s of Sen&s;es both External and Internal, by which Phy&s;icians &s;peak of them under divers Heads tho' they be from one and the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This Di&s;temper call'd Vapours or Hy&s;terick Pa&s;&s;ion in Women, is not always attended with the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Number of Symptoms, nor are the Symptoms th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ame, or equally violent in all, for in &s;ome the Suffo|cation and Difficulty of Breathing are but &s;light, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="66" REF="72">others very &s;evere; therefore in de&s;cribing the Symp|toms, it is not to be under&s;tood that they are le&s;s the Vapours, becau&s;e they have not all of them, for &s;ome feel the Symptoms as afore&s;aid in the Head, and there is Giodine&s;s, Swimming, Pain, and the like. In others, the Vital parts are affected, which occa|&s;ions &s;o great a Palpitation of the Heart, that the Patient verily believes the By-&s;tanders may hear the &s;ound of the Heart thumping upon the Ribs. Some it affects &s;o, as to cau&s;e Coughing without intermi&s;|&s;ion, but they expectorate nothing. Sometimes the Vapoury Humours fall upon the Parts between the Stomach a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d Bowels and occa&s;ion violent Pain, much like the <HI>Illiack Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and cau&s;e the Women to Vomit a green matter like porraceous Bile. Some|times the Spirits are &s;o &s;eized, that the Patient is op|pre&s;&s;ed with great Angui&s;h of Mind, and wholly di&s;pairs of Recovery with Dejections, and as it were a certain De&s;peration. Sometimes this Di&s;ea&s;e falls upon the Kidneys, and cau&s;es Pain like the Stone, or Stone Cholick. Sometimes it falls on the Bladder (tho' &s;eldom) and &s;tops the Urine, as if there was a Stone there. Sometimes it falls upon the Sto|mach, and cau&s;es continual Vomiting, and &s;ome|times upon the Bowels, and then a Loo&s;ene&s;s follows, but generally no Pain accompanies either of the&s;e Symptoms, tho oftentimes in both, the green Hu|mour aforementioned, appears either by Vomit or Stool.</P>
<P>And as this Di&s;ea&s;e afflicts almo&s;t all the inward Parts, &s;o &s;ometimes it &s;eizes all the outward Parts and Mu&s;culous Fle&s;h, occa&s;ioning Pain, and &s;ometimes a Tumour in the Jaws, Shoulders, Hands, Thighs and Legs, of which kind, that Tumour which &s;wells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he Legs is more con&s;picuous than the re&s;t; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e Pains and Swellings, afflicting the outward Parts,
<PB N="67" REF="73">chiefly &s;eize tho&s;e Women that are in a manner quite de&s;troy'd by a long Series and Force of the Vapours.</P>
<P>But among&s;t all the Torments of this Di&s;ea&s;e, there is none &s;o common as a Pain in the Back, which mo&s;t certainly all Women feel, how little &s;oever they are afflicted with the Vapours. It is al&s;o com|mon, that after the Pains are gone off, there is &s;uch a &s;tiffne&s;s of the Parts, or Numbne&s;s or Sorene&s;s, as if beaten, &s;o that the Patient cannot bear to have the Places touch'd; but this Tenderne&s;s goes off by de|grees. And this among&s;t the re&s;t is worth ob&s;erv|ing, That all Hy&s;terick Women complain of a De|jection and Sinking of the Spirits, who when they would &s;hew the place where the &s;inking of the Spi|rits is, point to the Region of the Lungs.</P>
<P>Yet of all the Symptoms that attend this Di&s;ea&s;e, nothing is more common or in&s;eparable, and more &s;hews the Patient to be troubled with Vapours, than that their Urine is as clear as Rock-water, and comes away, when they make it, in a plentiful quantity-e&s;pecially when they have ju&s;t before found them|&s;elves faint, ill, or &s;icki&s;h. Moreover, Women much troubled with Vapours belch up ill Fumes as often as they eat, tho' they only eat moderately, and as they have an Appetite. Al&s;o they &s;ometimes in their Fits laugh exceedingly, and &s;ome times cry as much, without any real Cau&s;e for either.</P>
<P>The efficient Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e, in my Opinion, proceeds from a Confu&s;ion of the Spirits; the origin and antecedent Cau&s;e of which Confu&s;ion, is the weak Con&s;titution of the Spirits and <HI>Genus Nervo&s;um,</HI> and that weak Con&s;titution injured as before &s;aid, is the Cau&s;e of the many Symptoms that are attend|ing, as we have in &s;omewhat particular terms ennumerated.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="74">
<P>As to the Progno&s;ticks, this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom kills the Patient, yet &s;ometimes it &s;natches them away when the Fit is inten&s;e and la&s;ts very long, or el&s;e draws on an Apoplexy or Syncope.</P>
<P>Of the &s;everal degrees of the Vapours or Hy&s;terick Fits, <HI>That</HI> is the wor&s;t, in which many Parts &s;uffer Convul&s;ions, and the Exerci&s;e of the Sen&s;es is inter|rupted; but <HI>That</HI> is &s;lighter, where the Mind is un|touched, or the right u&s;e of it not taken away, and but one or two Parts are convul&s;ed, e&s;pecially if the Vital Functions remain entire. In ancient People it is hardly curable, becau&s;e in them the Habit is con|tracted; in young Women it &s;ometimes cea&s;es of it &s;elf, as they grow in Years, or when they begin to have Chindren. Hy&s;terick Fits are dangerous to Women with Child, and in Child-bed, to the fir&s;t for fear of mi&s;carrying, and to the la&s;t by rea&s;on of their Weakne&s;s got in Labour.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Vapours is twofold, in the Fit, e&s;pecially when it is violent and of long duration, and out of the Fits, to prevent their coming again. Authors to bring the Patient out of the Fit, advi&s;e hard rubbing in the lower Parts, and Scarification in the Hips; they recommend likewi&s;e the pulling out the Hairs, the twi&s;ting of the Fingers, the putting to the No&s;e Foeted things, as A&s;&s;afaetida, Galbanum, burnt Feathers or Leather, Brim&s;tone lighted, the Smoak of Tobacco, Spirit, or Salt of Hartshorn, Armoniack, &s;harp Snuff, of white Hellebore, Eupho|bium, or the like, &s;ome of which have done, and may do good, when the Fit is not very extream; but in all Ca&s;es of De&s;peration, and al&s;o where the Fit is not very violent, (becau&s;e the &s;ooner the Patient is brought out of the Fit the better) I u&s;e my Apople|ctick Species pre&s;cribed in the 8th Chapter aforego|ing blowing a very little of it up each No&s;tril, which
<PB N="69" REF="75">in&s;tantly brings the Patient to her &s;elf, that &s;he is not &s;o fatigued, nor her Spirits &s;o worn or &s;pent, as they generally are if the Fit continues for a long time; this and this alone I have u&s;ed times without Number, with all the &s;ucce&s;s imaginable, and therefore can and do with the more freedom recommend it, it being, I believe, the only thing to &s;ave Life, where there is danger, in any &s;udden Fit of any kind, in Old or Young.</P>
<P>I was once call'd to a Lady, taken of a &s;udden with a Fit of the Vapours, which &s;he had been many Years &s;ubject to, tho' nothing near &s;o violent as then; &s;everal Surgeons were in&s;tantly call'd, as well as Neighbours and Friends, who when they came, thought &s;he was dying, &s;ome that &s;he was dead, no Life or Breath, to appearance, being left.

<P>The happy Effects of tho&s;e Vapour Pills, which neither Purge or di&s;order the Body in the lea&s;t, I found in a late Patient, who was &s;o extreamly over|whelm'd with the Vapours, that &s;he was never well, either in Mind or Body, nor free from them a Day together. Sometimes &s;he would have flu&s;hing Heats in her Hands and Face, at other times cold Sweats, at other times a trembling all over her, with Weak|ne&s;s in her Limbs that &s;he could &s;carce walk. Some|times Pains in her Head, that &s;he could not ri&s;e from her Pillow all Day. Othertimes &s;he would fall into Cryings, Fears, Dreads, and ruminate on a Thou|&s;and di&s;mal Things. Sometimes &s;he would call out for help, for that &s;he was dying and could not live a Minute, and would be in a Rage with tho&s;e that told her there was no danger Sometimes &s;he would foolli&s;hly laugh at nothing all of a &s;udden, and pre|&s;ently after Cry. Sometimes rave, &s;cold, and be angry at every thing. Sometimes &s;he would be mute, and not &s;peak a Word, nor Eat or Drink. In this Con|dition, which was very unhappy to all about her as well as to her &s;elf, &s;he took advice of many, and was, as &s;he hoped, &s;ometimes better, but her going through many Cour&s;es for a long time to &s;o little Benefit, tired out her Husband's Pur&s;e as well as her own Per&s;on, in&s;omuch, that they re&s;olv'd to leave off and &s;ee what Nature would do, which alas! was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oo feeble to &s;truggle through her difficulties; which they &s;eeing, and, by means of a certain Lady whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> had before cured, hearing of my Vapour Pills &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, as &s;he &s;aid, to talk with me, de&s;pairing thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er whole Di&s;cour&s;e of any Help.

<PB N="73" REF="79">which by her Friends per&s;wa&s;ions &s;he con&s;ented to do, and in le&s;s than Three Weeks time, contrary to her Faith, &s;he grew &s;o well that in her own Opinion &s;he then believed &s;he &s;hould be cured. I advi&s;ed her to proceed in the Cour&s;e, which was nothing more than to take Three of my Vapour Pills every Night and Morning, and an Hour after the Morning Do&s;e to drink to Flask of <HI>German</HI> Spaw-Water, taking Two Hours time for the drinking it by moderate Draughts (which is much better than to drink it too quick o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> too much at a Draught) which &s;he did as I directed, and u&s;ed at the &s;ame time moderate Exerci&s;e of Walk|ing, and Riding in a Chai&s;e, as I advited, for about Nine Weeks, in which time &s;he was perfectly reco|vered, and was, and is at the writing of this, as com|pleatly well as if &s;he had never been ill.
