<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE Recovery of PERSONS drown'd.</HEAD>
<P>_AS Truth in general is of the la&s;t Im|portance, not only in affording a noble and exalted Satisfaction to the Mind, but al&s;o in forming the Mo|rals, and by that Means, promoting the mo&s;t valuable Intere&s;ts of So|ciety; &s;o nothing can be a greater Reproach to Rea&s;on, nor a more palpable Affront offered to its augu&s;t and venerable Author, than that ignoble and unmanly Turn of Mind, commonly known by the Name of <HI>Credulity,</HI> which is no more than an implicit Contempt of Rea&s;on, and all the mental Powers, producing a Propen&s;ity to believe certain Tenets, Doctrines, or Facts, without that Degree of Evidence, which a Mind &s;tudious of Truth ought to require.</P>
<P>But however odious <HI>Credulity</HI> may appear, when painted in her native Colours, &s;he is neverthele&s;s,
<PB N="2" REF="4">if we may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;ion, a <HI>Spectre,</HI> which haunts the various Cla&s;&s;es and Di&s;tinctions of Mankind, under a Form &s;o infatuating and alluring, as to &s;educe them from the plain and amiable Paths of Truth, and bewilder them in the dark and gloomy Labyrinths of Ignorance, Error, and Confu&s;ion. This deplorable Ob&s;erva|tion is in no In&s;tance more effectually verified, than in the&s;e very Men, who profe&s;s a &s;acred Ve|neration for Rea&s;on, and pretend to go wherever Truth &s;hall conduct them; for, we frequently find, not only antient, but al&s;o modern Philo&s;o|phers and Phy&s;icians, labouring with a pompous Shew of Learning and Ratiocination, to prove that Nature, by her &s;tated and e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, was capable of producing certain Effects, which Time has afterwards di&s;covered never to have had any Exi&s;tence, except in the Imaginations of the Credulous, or in the chimerical Works of Au|thors, who for&s;aking Fact and Nature, have giv|en a full Scope to their Fancy and Invention. Thus in former Ages it was keenly di&s;puted, how it came about, that a &s;mall Fi&s;h, call'd the <HI>Remora,</HI> was capable of putting a &s;peedy Stop to a Ship under Full-&s;ail; but this pretended Fact has, by later and more penetrating Naturali&s;ts, been di&s;cover'd to be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. And, no doubt, the ever memorable Rabbit-Woman of <HI>Godalmin,</HI> would have made a con&s;iderable Fi|gure in the Annals of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and af|forded Matter to the Members for copious Di&s;|&s;ertations on the Force of Imagination, if &s;he had prudently ceas'd Breeding a Day &s;ooner. This bad Piece of Conduct, has, however, thrown an almo&s;t irreparable Di&s;grace upon <HI>natural Know|ledge,</HI> by inducing the &s;ober and judicious Part of Mankind to imagine, that it was totally employ'd
<PB N="3" REF="5">in explaining Vi&s;ions and Chimeras. Therefore, if we intend to philo&s;ophi&s;e in &s;uch a manner as not to di&s;grace Philo&s;ophy, we mu&s;t have Facts duly a&s;certain'd, before we attempt to explain and ac|count for them; &s;ince, according to <HI>Kercher,</HI> in his <HI>Mund. Subterran.</HI> Lib. 10. <Q>"'Tis as ab&s;urd in phy&s;ical Matters, to philo&s;ophi&s;e without Experience, as it is for a blind Man to pretend to judge of Colours."</Q></P>
<P>Tho' from what has been &s;aid, it &s;ufficiently appears, that <HI>Credulity</HI> is fatal to Truth, yet we ob&s;erve in the Minds of &s;ome Men, an arrogant and pre&s;umptuous <HI>Sceptici&s;m,</HI> which, admitting no|thing but what is ea&s;y to the Conception of its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, is no le&s;s prejudicial to the genuine In|tere&s;t of Science, and Philo&s;ophy; for, as, by the former we are expos'd to the Danger of adopt|ing Error as well as Truth; &s;o by the latter our Minds are, as it were, manacled, and hinder'd from giving a rational A&s;&s;ent to Things and Facts cloath'd with the mo&s;t &s;triking and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Characters of Evidence, for no other Rea&s;on, than that we cannot comprehend them. It is, for In|&s;tance, a culpable Diffidence, to di&s;believe the Po&s;|&s;ibility of a Per&s;on's retaining a latent Principle of Life, after he has remain'd &s;ome Hours, Days, and even Weeks under Water, &s;ince numerous Facts, related by the be&s;t Authors, vouch'd by the mo&s;t candid Witne&s;&s;es, and recorded in the publick Archives of the mo&s;t penetrating and &s;agacious Nations, concur to remove the &s;malle&s;t Remains of Uncertainty in this Point. Be&s;ides, I would have the Gentlemen of this Cla&s;s remem|ber, that their Conduct be&s;peaks an in&s;upportable Degree of Pride, and amounts to a formal De|claration, that they them&s;elves are ble&s;&s;ed with Geniu&s;es far &s;uperior to others, &s;ince nothing can
<PB N="4" REF="6">be true, but what is comprehen&s;ible by the va&s;t Extent of their Capacities. And tho' Mode&s;ty and Common-Sen&s;e, &s;hould not direct them to this Ob&s;ervation, yet what the World calls <HI>moral Evi|dence</HI> &s;tands upon Foundations, too &s;table and &s;ure to be &s;haken by their frivolous Conceits, or ill|grounded Remon&s;trances. In a Word, the wi&s;e and thinking Part of Mankind will always be in|duc'd to give their A&s;&s;ent to Facts &s;een by a &s;uf|ficient Number of Witne&s;&s;es, who have Sen&s;e e|nough to guard again&s;t Impo&s;ture them&s;elves, and Hone&s;ty enough to &s;ay nothing but what is Truth to their Neighbours. All the&s;e advantagious Circum|&s;tances attend the following Narrations, which, for the common Benefit of Mankind, have been collected from Authors of the greate&s;t Veracity, in order to &s;hew, that there is often a Po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;tor|ing drown'd Per&s;ons to Life, after vulgar Preju|dice, and a Want of &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive Views with Re&s;pect to the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, have laid a Foundation for concluding them irre|trieveably dead, and pa&s;t all Hopes of Recovery.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Bruhier,</HI> an eminent Phy&s;ician of <HI>Paris,</HI> well known to the learned World, and highly e&s;teem'd for his Knowledge in his Profe&s;&s;ion, a|bout three Years ago, publi&s;h'd a Treati&s;e on the <HI>Uncertain Signs of Death,</HI> tending to prove, that many People are interr'd before they are really dead; and that there are frequent In&s;tances of Per|&s;ons who have liv'd many Days without Re&s;pira|tion, or any other apparent Signs of Life. This Doctrine he e&s;tabli&s;hes by many inconte&s;table Hi&s;|tories of People who have actually &s;urviv'd their Funerals, and liv'd many Years after they had been buried, upon a Suppo&s;ition, that they were actually dead. Hence he very judiciou&s;ly infers,
<PB N="5" REF="7">that 'tis not imprudent but inhuman, to &s;uffer the Interment of our Friends and Relations, before we are convinc'd from the mo&s;t evident Marks, that they are certainly and irrecoverably deceas'd; or till &s;uch time as the Beginning of Putrefaction convinces us, that no Hopes remain of a Revival.</P>
<P>In Confirmation of what this celebrated Phy&s;i|cian has advanc'd, many Examples might be found in our own Country, which e&s;cap'd his Re|&s;earches; and no doubt it happens much more frequently, than is generally imagin'd; e&s;pecial|ly in hy&s;terical Women, in tho&s;e who have con|tracted a Habit of drinking &s;pirituous Liquors to Exce&s;s, but particularly in tho&s;e who have been guilty (for &s;o I can't forbear calling it) of taking frequent Do&s;es of Opium, or its Preparations, &s;o as to render Life in&s;upportable without them, of which there are too many In&s;tances.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, however true, is not altogether modern; for we learn from <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> that the celebrated <HI>Empedocles</HI> acquir'd uncommon Honour, by re&s;toring a Woman to Life who was thought to be dead many Days, and who&s;e Dis|order he di&s;cover'd to be only a Strangulation of the Uterus, that is, an hy&s;teric Fit.</P>
<P>We learn, farther, that <HI>Heraclides</HI> of <HI>Pontus,</HI> a noted Philo&s;opher, wrote a Treati&s;e upon this ve|ry Subject, which he intitled, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Of the Di&s;temper in which the Patient is depriv'd of Re&s;piration.</HI> In this he a&s;&s;erted, that the Di&s;or|der might continue thirty Days, during which there was no Re&s;piration, or any other Signs of Life, without any Marks of Putrefaction; and that notwith&s;tanding, the Patient might at la&s;t re|cover.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of the frequent Interments of People before they were really dead, Dr. <HI>Bruhier,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">in 1745, publi&s;h'd a &s;mall Pamphlet, containing Propo&s;als for the Regulation of Funerals, and the Prevention of &s;uch calamitous Di&s;a&s;ters; which he endeavours to have confirm'd by the Legi&s;lature; for, &s;ays he, how many Women weary of their Hu&s;bands, and Hu&s;bands equally weary of their Wives; how many Children who have either a real or an imaginary Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with their Parents; and, e&s;pecially, how many cove|tous and nece&s;&s;itous Heirs, who have long waited for the happy Moment, which was to put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an opulent Fortune, may not abu&s;e the Liberty the Law affords them of burying their Friends at the End of twenty-four Hours, at which Time they may, po&s;&s;ibly, be really alive, and capable of a Recovery. And to prove this Regulation the more nece&s;&s;ary, he relates the fol|lowing Hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>A Woman about eighty Years old, being taken for dead, was about to be laid out as &s;uch, when a Per&s;on, who had perus'd his Treati&s;e, oppos'd the De&s;ign. Next Morning the Woman was found recover'd from her profound Syncope, which, con&s;idering the inten&s;e Cold of the Sea&s;on, had probably prov'd a real Cau&s;e of her Death, had &s;he been taken out of her Bed.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;ufficiently known, that Cardinal <HI>Spi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">c&s;a,</HI> fir&s;t Mini&s;ter to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> being &s;uppo&s;ed dead, and committed to a Surgeon in order to be embalm'd, thru&s;t away the Hand which conducted the fatal In&s;trument, which put a real End to his Life. But notwith&s;tanding this Accident, the barbarous Surgeon proceeded to fini&s;h the Operation.</P>
<P>But as Submer&s;ion, or Drowning, is the Subject of our pre&s;ent Enquiry, I &s;hall only farther take Notice of the Hi&s;tories relating thereto.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>The celebrated <HI>Kunckel,</HI> in <HI>Ephemerid. Nat. Curio&s;.</HI> informs us, that a young Man had the Mi&s;|fortune to fall from a Boat into the Water, and &s;unk to the very Bottom, about fifteen hundred Paces, from the Shoar, which he did not reach till two Hours after. However, as it is natural for Per&s;ons to give an Account of the &s;everal Circum&s;tances attending their re&s;pective States of Calamity and Di&s;tre&s;s, the young Man inform'd tho&s;e who had the Curio&s;ity to enquire into his Condition during that Time, that whil&s;t he was making the mo&s;t &s;trenuous Efforts to pre&s;erve his Life, he thought of nothing but God, and the Means of recommending him&s;elf to his Favour and Acceptance; that the Voice of his darling Si&s;ter, who wept bitterly on the Shore, for the Fate of her Brother, had &s;erv'd to conduct him to the Land; that the Di&s;turbance of the Water by tho&s;e who &s;ought for him, and the Lamentations of the People on the Shore, were not only di&s;tinctly heard by him, but al&s;o prov'd extremely &s;hock|ing and unea&s;y to him; that he thought his Re|&s;piration was carried on, without his knowing in what Manner, that the Water had not penetrated into any of the Cavities of his Body; and that he was hot, in&s;tead of being cold.</P>
<P>The &s;ame judicious Author informs us, that he had an Opportunity of examining a Fi&s;herman, who fell from a Boat into the &s;ame Place, and was, by Means of the Ice, kept under Water for three Days, but upon his being found, appear'd full of Vi|gour, &s;aid that he enjoy'd good Health, and af|firm'd, that the mo&s;t remarkable Circum&s;tance of which he had been con&s;cious was, that a large Bladder had been form'd around his Head for his Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>The memorable Accident which befel the <HI>Swi&s;s Diver</HI> is &s;o well atte&s;ted, and accompanied with &s;uch a peculiar Train of Circum&s;tances, that it cannot fail to make the mo&s;t lively Impre&s;&s;ions upon every Per&s;on capable of the &s;malle&s;t Degree of Reflection. As Nece&s;&s;ity lays a Foundation for Indu&s;try, which frequently cannot be employ'd, but in a manner, which is either prejudicial to Health, or fatal to Life, &s;o this adventurous Man follow'd the Bu&s;ine&s;s of plunging into the Water, and &s;earching tho&s;e Holes in which he imagined the larger and better Sort of Fi&s;hes were lodg'd. Accordingly, being employ'd as Dr. <HI>Bruhier</HI> re|lates the Story, to furni&s;h a Di&s;h of Fi&s;h for a Company, who intended to regale them&s;elves with a fine Dinner, he cheerfully undertook the Ta&s;k. His Employers, in the mean Time, accompanied him to the Brink of the River, and &s;eeing him plunge into the Water, retir'd, not in the lea&s;t doubting but he would keep his Word. The <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> however, happening not to bring the Fi&s;h at the Hour appointed, the Company, when the Afternoon was pretty far advanc'd, went to the Banks of the River, in order to know the Rea|&s;on of their Di&s;appointment. As the Clothes of the Diver lay on the River-&s;ide, &s;o they &s;oon &s;u|&s;pected his deplorable Fate, and accordingly or|der'd him to be &s;earch'd for with Hooks, in the Place into which they had &s;een him plunge. The Efforts for this Purpo&s;e were not in vain, for he was at la&s;t found, and taken out of the Water, tho' wounded in &s;everal Parts.</P>
<P>As this unfortunate Man had been under Water for nine Hours, &s;o the Curate of the Place, who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion call'd for &s;ome Care of a Per&s;on in &s;uch a Situation, had a Mind that he &s;hould be forth|with interr'd; and he had been infallibly commit|ted
<PB N="9" REF="11">to the Grave, had not the celebrated Mr. <HI>Egly,</HI> a Member of the Royal Academy of <HI>In&s;criptions,</HI> who ob&s;erv'd a Kind of Ebullition in the Water di&s;charg'd from his Mouth, po&s;itively affirm'd that he was not dead. For that Gentleman ju&s;tly a&s;crib'd this Ebullition to the languid and imper|ceptible Remains of Re&s;piration.</P>
<P>This Conduct of Mr. <HI>Egly,</HI> however uncom|mon, yet made &s;o deep an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Spectators, that they carried the unfortunate Di|ver, into an adjacent Hou&s;e, where having laid him out at full Length, they compre&s;s'd his Ab|domen, in order to procure a Di&s;charge of the Water he had &s;wallow'd. By this Means having in three Quarters of an Hour evacuated a con&s;i|derable Quantity of Water, he mov'd one of his Legs, a Circum&s;tance which &s;ufficiently evinc'd that he &s;till retain'd &s;ome faint Remains of Life. For this Rea&s;on he was, by Mr. <HI>Egly</HI>'s Orders, wrap'd up in warm Sheets, and gradually reftor|ed to a natural Heat. Then being laid in a warm Bed, and his Life becoming gradually more con|&s;picuous, a liberal Vene&s;ection was made, which was &s;ucceeded by a Sigh, then by a &s;light Know|ledge of what had befallen him, and &s;oon after by a total Re&s;titution of Health; and tho' Gratitude is rarely to be met with in the Brea&s;ts of the Vul|gar, yet this important Service, ever after touch'd the Heart of the <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> with the highe&s;t and mo&s;t lively Sen&s;e of the Obligations he lay under to Mr. <HI>Egly.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Durham,</HI> a Gentleman &s;ufficiently celebrat|ed for his untainted Integrity, and exten&s;ive Learn|ing, in his <HI>Phy&s;ico-Theology,</HI> quotes the following Hi&s;tory from <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> an Author of no le&s;s Can|dour and Reputation.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>About eighteen Years ago, a Gardner of <HI>Fron|ningholm,</HI> now &s;ixty-five Years old, and &s;ufficiently vigorous and robu&s;t for a Per&s;on of that Age, made a generous Attempt to re&s;cue an unfortu|nate Neighbour who had fallen into the Water; but being too fool-hardy, he ventur'd upon the Ice, which broke, and let him fall into the River, which at that Part was eighteen Ells in Depth: He went perpendicularly to be Bottom, in which his Feet &s;tuck for &s;ixteen Hours before he was found. He him&s;elf &s;ays, that he was no &s;ooner under Water, than he became rigid, and lo&s;t not only the Power of Motion, but al&s;o all his Sen&s;es, except that of hearing, which was affected by the Ringing of &s;ome Bells at <HI>Stockholm.</HI> He at fir&s;t, al&s;o perceived a Kind of Bladder before his Mouth, which hinder'd the Ingre&s;s of the Water by that Pa&s;&s;age tho' it enter'd freely into his Ears, and produc'd a Dulne&s;s of Hearing for &s;ome Time after. This unfortunate Man was in vain &s;ought for during &s;ixteen Hours, at the End of which Time he was taken up by Means of an Hook fix'd in his Head, and upon his total Recovery &s;aid, that he was &s;en&s;ible of that particular Part of his Fate. However, whether from the prevailing Cu|&s;tom of the Country, or the Per&s;ua&s;ion of particu|lar Per&s;ons, certain Attempts were made in order to re&s;tore him to Life: For this Purpo&s;e he was wrap'd up in Blankets, le&s;t the Air entering too precipitately into his Lungs &s;hould prove fatal to him. In this Condition, being gradually warm'd by Means of Sheets, he was rubb'd and &s;timulated till the Motion of his Blood, which had been check'd for &s;o many Hours, return'd. At la&s;t he was totally re&s;tor'd by Means of Cordials, and an|tiapoplectic Liquors. He as yet bears the Mark of the Hook, and &s;ays, that he is &s;till &s;ubject to vi|olent
<PB N="11" REF="13">Head-achs. This &s;ingular Accident, atte&s;ted by the Oaths of Per&s;ons who had been Eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es to it, induc'd the Queen to give him an an|nual Pen&s;ion, and he was introduc'd to the Prince, in order to give an Account of what had befallen him.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Pechlinus</HI> has wrote the Hi&s;tory of a Woman, who remaining under Water for three whole Days, was happily re&s;tor'd to Life, almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as the Gardner. This Fact, was &s;o notorious, that the learned <HI>Tila&s;ius,</HI> Libra|ry-keeper to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and in who&s;e Time the Woman was &s;till alive, gave the follow|ing Certificate of it, which is &s;till kept in the Ar|chives of the <HI>Acad. Natur. Curio&s;.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There lately was in</HI> Dalia, <HI>commonly called</HI> Worm&s;|land, <HI>a Woman of the Name of</HI> Margaret Lar&s;dotter, <HI>who having the Misfortune to be thrice drown'd, remain'd the fir&s;t Time, &s;he being then young, for three whole Days under Water, but the two other Times had more &s;peedy Relief afforded her. She died in</HI> 1672, <HI>in the &s;eventy-fifth Year of her Age.</HI> Tela&s;ius.</P>
<P>Tho' this Accident, and the Delivery from it, happening &s;o many different Times to the &s;ame Per&s;on, may be &s;ome be look'd upon as fabulous and romantic, yet upon the whole it appears to be cloath'd with the mo&s;t genuine Character of Truth and Evidence; for is it credible, that a Man of Probity, Candour, and learning, as we may rea|dily &s;uppo&s;e the Librarian of a rich and powerful Monarch to be, &s;hould in a manner &s;o po&s;itive and circum&s;tantial, dare to affirm a Fact, which was only &s;u&s;pect, and much le&s;s one that was ab&s;o|lutely fal&s;e? Is it probable that a Man of <HI>Pechlinus</HI>'s Character, who is no le&s;s univer&s;ally than ju&s;tly
<PB N="12" REF="14">applauded for his exten&s;ive Erudition and con|&s;ummate medicinal Knowledge, &s;hould compo&s;e an elaborate Treati&s;e in order to explain the Po&s;|&s;ibility of this Fact, without taking due Pains to have its Reality &s;ufficiently confirm'd and a&s;cer|tain'd? or, in a word, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this Phy&s;ician, who was look'd upon as the Glo|ry and Ornament of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Nation, &s;hould have the Impudence, to appeal to all the <HI>Literati</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for the Truth of a Fact, which had not the Sanction of &s;ufficient Evidences? Why &s;hould we be more &s;crupulous than <HI>Pechlinus</HI>'s con|temporary Authors, who never call'd the Truth of this Fact in Que&s;tions? The celebrated <HI>Bartholin,</HI> in <HI>Act. Med. Haffn. Tom.</HI> 3. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 42. &s;peaks of it in the following manner; <Q>"I can by no Means remain diffident with re&s;pect to the Truth of a Story confirm'd by the concurring Te&s;timonies of &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es of Candour and Vera|city; and of which <HI>Pechlinus</HI> has demon&s;trated the Po&s;&s;ibility by other Examples of a &s;imilar Nature: I am only &s;urpris'd, that &s;o &s;ingular a Narrative, &s;hould be &s;o long buried in Oblivion, in a Nation otherwi&s;e &s;o curious and fond of Di&s;coveries."</Q></P>
<P>But we &s;hall have no manner of Rea&s;on to doubt of this Fact recorded by <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> when we re|flect, that other celebrated Phy&s;icians and Philo&s;o|phers, a&s;&s;ure us of the Truth of other Accidents highly &s;imilar and analogous to it. Thus <HI>Alexan|der Benedicius,</HI> Lib. x. Cap. 9. &s;peaks in the fol|lowing manner. <Q>"Life has been frequently &s;een re&s;tor'd to Per&s;ons who have remain'd under Water during forty-eight Hours."</Q> The &s;ame Author, for this very Rea&s;on, thinks it highly im|proper, to inter drown'd and hy&s;teric Patients, till &s;eventy-two hours after their &s;uppos'd Death.
<PB N="13" REF="15"><HI>Borelli,</HI> in <HI>Cant.</HI> 2. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 2. informs us, that, <Q>"a cer|tain Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction having remain'd for a long Time under the Water, was taken for dead when he was found; but proper Efforts being made to re&s;tore his Life, he was rous'd from his &s;uppos'd Death, and long &s;urviv'd his Misfortune."</Q> Be&s;ides, the Credibility of the Fact, told by <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> is &s;ufficiently confirm'd by the Suffrage of the learned and judicious <HI>Zac|chias,</HI> who, in his 79th Con&s;ultation, wrote in or|der to determine, whether the Return of Life to a young Man who had remain'd an Hour under Water, was miraculous, and as &s;ome &s;uper&s;ti|tious People would have it, to be a&s;crib'd to a Per&s;on of &s;uperior Sanctity, &s;peaks in the follow|ing manner. <Q>"This Event is &s;o far from being miraculous, that it can hardly come under the Denomination of &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;ince va&s;t Numbers of Per&s;ons have return'd to Life, after having been drown'd, or &s;uffocated in any other man|ner, not only for &s;ome Hours, but al&s;o during one, and even three whole Days; becau&s;e the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Re&s;piration in the Water, had occa&s;ioned an Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Spirits, and had brought on an apoplectic Paroxy&s;m, which render'd them apparently dead, tho' their Lives were really pre&s;erv'd by Tran&s;piration, which augmenting gradually, laid a Foundation for a free Re&s;piration."</Q></P>
<P>The Po&s;&s;ibility of retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water, is &s;till more &s;ur|pri&s;ingly confirm'd by <HI>Kunckel,</HI> in <HI>Mi&s;cellan. Nat. Curio&s;. Decad.</HI> 3. <HI>An.</HI> 5 &amp; 6. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 71. where he &s;peaks in the following manner. <Q>"I am &s;uffici|ently &s;en&s;ible, that in <HI>Sweden,</HI> no one Doubts of the Po&s;&s;ibility of retaining Life under Water for eight Days; and that the &s;ollowing Accident is
<PB N="14" REF="16">by no Means call'd in Que&s;tion by tho&s;e who live near the Place where it happened. Some Time ago, about four Leagues from the Town of <HI>Falung,</HI> a Painter fell from a Boat into the Water in &s;uch a manner, as to remain upright with his Feet at the Bottom. He was in vain &s;earch'd for during eight Days; at the End of which Time, he appear'd alive on the Surface of the Water. The Magi&s;trate and Clergyman of the Place, a&s;k'd him the following Que&s;tions. Whether he had re&s;pir'd all the Time of his Submer&s;ion? To which he an&s;wer'd, He knew nothing of the Matter. Whether he had thought upon God and recommended his Soul to him? To which he reply'd, Very often. Whether he could &s;ee and hear? To which he an&s;wer'd, Yes, and &s;aid that he would often have laid hold of the Hooks employ'd in finding him, if he could have mov'd his Arms. He al&s;o, add|ed, that the Fi&s;h prov'd highly offen&s;ive and unea&s;y to him, by the Attacks they made on his Eyes; and being a&s;k'd by what Means he guard|ed again&s;t the&s;e Attacks, he an&s;wer'd, by mov|ing his Eye-lids. As to his Sen&s;e of hearing, he affirm'd, that nothing wrs more ungrateful, and even painful, to him than &s;triking the Sur|face of the Water; and that in a particular man|ner, he was affected with a violent Pain of his Ears, which was forthwith communicated to his whole Body, every Time People came to draw Water in Buckets. When he was a&s;k'd, Whe|he had been &s;en&s;ible of Hunger, and di&s;charg'd his Excrements? He reply'd, that he had not. Being interrogated, Whether he had &s;lept? he an&s;wer'd, he knew nothing of it, but believ'd he had, becau&s;e he was &s;ome time depriv'd of all Sen&s;ation and Reflection; adding, that all
<PB N="15" REF="17">the Thoughts he remember'd to have pa&s;s'd in his Brea&s;t, had only God, and the Means of his own Deliverance, for their Objects."</Q></P>
<P>The Nature and Circum&s;tances of the Accident now related, lay a &s;ufficient Foundation, for our believing the following memorable Event, e&s;pe|cially as it happened to a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, and is atte&s;ted as authentic by Men of Learning and Probity.</P>
<P><HI>Gocellinus,</HI> a young Man, and Nephew to one of the Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Cologne,</HI> had the Misfortune to fall into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and was not found for fifteen Days after; and being laid in an adjacent Church, in order to be interr'd, &s;oon return'd to Life, and &s;urviv'd the Accident a long Time.</P>
<P>As there are a great many &s;ecret Things in Na|ture, and probably numberle&s;s latent Circum&s;tances in the animal Oeconomy, with which we are en|tirely unacquainted; and as Per&s;ons of a curious and attentive Turn of Mind, daily ob&s;erve Acci|dents, which they before thought impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o we have no Rea&s;on to doubt of &s;urpri&s;ing Facts, re|lated by Men of Learning and Candour, nor for|mally to deny the Truth of Events, which at fir&s;t appear incredible. Of this Kind, is the following Narrative.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mr. <HI>Burmann</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that in <HI>Bone&s;s</HI> of <HI>Pithovia,</HI> he heard a funeral Sermon preach'd upon the Death of one <HI>Laurence Jones,</HI> a Man of &s;eventy Years of Age, who as the Preacher &s;aid, was drown'd when &s;ixteen Years old; and continued &s;even Weeks under Water, notwith&s;tand|ing which, he return'd to Life, and enjoy'd good Health. However vi&s;ionary and romantic this Ac|cident may appear, in the Eyes of tho&s;e who pre|tend to have dive&s;ted their Minds of vulgar Er|rors, yet it has met with Credit from the mo&s;t pe|netrating
<PB N="16" REF="18">and &s;agacious Authors who liv'd at the Time in which it happen'd. Thus the learned and judicious <HI>Langelott,</HI> in <HI>Mi&s;cellan. Natur. Curio&s;. Decad.</HI> 1. <HI>An.</HI> 6. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 20, not being able to con|ceive how a Per&s;on can pre&s;erve a Principle of Life &s;o long, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Air, in Wa|ters &s;o cold and full of Nitre, as tho&s;e of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and not being &s;atisfied with &s;imilar Accidents daily happening to &s;ome Birds and Infects, is yet &s;o far from doubting of the Truth of this Acci|dent, that he applies to the learned Members of the <HI>Acad. Natur. Curio&s;.</HI> for their Opinion and Explication of it; by which Means he imagin'd that effectual Mea&s;ures for re&s;toring many drown'd Per&s;ons might be di&s;cover'd. Be&s;ides, it is by no Means probable that a Man of Mr. <HI>Burmann</HI>'s Ve|racity would forge &s;uch a Story, in order to &s;ee what enormous Lengths Credulity was capable of carrying his Fellow-Creatures; nor is it po&s;&s;ible that the Clergyman, &s;hould, from the Pulpit, a&s;|&s;ert this Fact as true, if it had not really been &s;o, &s;ince <HI>Laurence Jones,</HI> was a Native of the Place, and well known to every one of his Audience.</P>
<P>But upon the Whole, granting that this Narra|tive of <HI>Laurence Jones</HI> was fal&s;e, which however we have no Rea&s;on to believe, yet the Recital of it has a great Tendency not only to illu&s;trate our Subject, but al&s;o to produce happy Effects in Life; for, 1&s;t, It is certainly the genuine and uncontro|verted Intere&s;t of the Public, to be appriz'd of the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Per&s;on's retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water; 2dly, The Conclu&s;ion to be drawn from this &s;eemingly mira|culous Effect is, that if after a long Time, a Bo|dy is taken out of the Water, without the Signs of Putrefaction, it is the Duty of tho&s;e who find &s;uch a Body, to treat it as if there were &s;till a
<PB N="17" REF="19">Po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;toring it to Life; and 3dly, If it is certain from uncontroverted Facts, that Per&s;ons have retain'd Life under Water for &s;everal Days, there is no Rea&s;on, from the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, and the hitherto known Properties of the animal Fluids, to di&s;believe that the like &s;hould happen to Per&s;ons who have al&s;o remain'd under Water for &s;everal Weeks.</P>
<P>As our Mode&s;ty ought always to be propor|tion'd to the difficult and intricate natures of the Subjects we pretend to con&s;ider, &s;o we frankly acknowledge, that the&s;e and other &s;imilar Acci|dents, as it were, bewilder the Mind, and perplex the mo&s;t penetrating Capacities, when they attempt to account for them; &s;ince we have never yet di&s;cover'd wherein the con&s;tituent Principle of Life exactly con&s;i&s;ts, and &s;ince there are various Properties both of the Solids and Fluids of the human Body, to which we are intire Strangers. Some however, affirm, that a Principle of Life may in the deplorable State of Submer&s;ion, be re|tain'd for a long Time, becau&s;e the Coldne&s;s of the Water renders the Circulation &s;lower, and &s;upper&s;&s;es the Tran&s;piration of the vital Air con|tain'd in the Blood; whil&s;t at the &s;ame Time, &s;ome Portions of the Air lodg'd in the Water, probably penetrate into the Bodies of &s;uch Per|&s;ons. But <HI>Platerus</HI> and <HI>Bartholin</HI> &s;eem to account in a more rational and &s;atisfactory manner for Phaenomena of this Kind. The former of the&s;e Authors, in explaining how a Woman, who was drown'd in the <HI>Rhine,</HI> for murdering her own Child, return'd to Life after &s;he was found, af|firms, that this Accident was the Effect of a Syn|cope, in which Re&s;piration and the Motion of
<PB N="18" REF="20">the Heart are &s;topt. Now 'tis certain from Expe|rience and Ob&s;ervation, that the&s;e two Functions may be &s;uppere&s;s'd without the actual Lo&s;s of Life, as is frequently obvious in violent Syncopes, and hy&s;teric Paroxy&s;ms, from which the Patients do not often recover in an Hour or more, during which Time, the &s;lighte&s;t Indications of Life by the Pul&s;e and Re&s;piration, are not to be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>If any one &s;hould &s;ay, that it be&s;peaks an un|pardonable Exce&s;s of Credulity, to believe that a Syncope may la&s;t for a Week or longer, and that con&s;equently the Motion of the Heart and Pul&s;e may be for that Time &s;u&s;pended, without nece&s;|&s;arily producing Death; we may ju&s;tly reply, that hitherto no Per&s;on has di&s;cover'd wherein the E&s;&s;ence and Principle of Life con&s;i&s;ts; and that there are in Nature various Phaenomena, which &s;eem to prove, that the Motion of the Heart, and the Circulation of the Humours, are rather palpable Signs of the Exi&s;tence of Life, than its proximate and immediate Cau&s;es. This Doctrine we &s;hall endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h, in a &s;trictly ana|logical manner, by comparing tho&s;e Events which happen to Vegetables and the Brute Creation, with &s;imilar Accidents which befall Mankind.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e we &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the State and Condition of &s;uch Plants, as retain a Princi|ple of Life and Vegetation during the whole Win|ter. All the Difference, according to <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> between the&s;e, and the Plants of the animal Kind is, that in the latter the Principle of Motion is weaker, and the Texture of the Fibres le&s;s firm; whereas the former contain a much larger Quan|tity of Oil, and have the Spirit &s;ub&s;ervient to their Vegetation repell'd by the Cold, to the Bulbs,
<PB N="19" REF="21">Roots, and Seeds, where it circulates in a languid manner, without having Force to propel Buds, Flowers, and Blo&s;&s;oms, till the kind and genial Hears of the Spring, render it more powerful and active. Why may we not, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e that &s;omething analogous to this may happen in &s;ome human Bodies, who have been under the Water for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>This is not the only In&s;tance in nature, which we can bring in Confirmation of our Doctrine; for certain In&s;ects pa&s;s the whole Winter in <HI>Chry&s;alides,</HI> or con&s;iderably hard Pellicules, with|out di&s;covering the &s;malle&s;t Signs of Life, tho' 'tis certain they are not dead, &s;ince a &s;mall De|gree of Heat only, is requi&s;ite to produce their la&s;t Metamorpho&s;is. The Rea&s;on of this apparent Death, is the Cold of the Atmo&s;phere, &s;o in&s;pi&s;|&s;ating their Fluids, as that they can only circulate in a faint and languid manner, round an highly minute and &s;mall Center. The Degree of Fluidi|ty which they retain, is however, &s;o con&s;iderable, that a more inten&s;e Cold than we perceive on the Earth, is incapable of totally coagulating them, as is &s;ufficiently evinc'd by the curious Experi|ments of Mr. <HI>Reaumur.</HI></P>
<P>This Phaenomenon is not only ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Chry&s;alides</HI> of In&s;ects, but the <HI>Seminal Principle</HI> is al&s;o pre&s;erv'd free from Coagulation, and without di&s;covering the &s;malle&s;t Sign of Life, in Eggs, which may be con&s;ider'd as the <HI>Chry&s;alides,</HI> or Pel|licules of Animals who&s;e Life is perceptible. A|quatic In&s;ects, al&s;o, plunge them&s;elves into the Mud, where they remain without Motion, till the Spring; which holds equally true of Frogs and Toads, according to <HI>Valentinus,</HI> in <HI>Di&s;&s;ert. Epi&s;tol.</HI> 4.
<PB N="20" REF="22">The like happens to &s;ome terre&s;trial In&s;ects; for Mr. <HI>Reaumur</HI> has by Experiment and Observa|tion &s;ufficiently evinc'd, that Ants during the whole Winter, remain apparently dead, till the Approach of the Spring.</P>
<P>A third and more powerful collateral Proof of this Doctrine, is drawn from the Con&s;ideration of &s;ome Animals, whole Blood is warm, and circu|lates in the &s;ame manner with that of the Human Species; &s;ince in the&s;e al&s;o the Circulation and Re&s;piration are &s;uppre&s;s'd during the Winter, but return in the Spring.</P>
<P>Thus of Swallows it may be &s;aid, that during one Half of the Year they are dead, and the other alive. <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> and <HI>Scheffer,</HI> in a Letter wrote to <HI>Hevelius,</HI> affirm, that in &s;ome northerly Countries, it is very common for Fi&s;hermen to find in the Water large Clu&s;ters of Swallows, which in the Beginning of the Autumn, had thus pil'd them&s;elves up. Tho&s;e Authors al&s;o inform us, that &s;ome Species of Swallows, &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;eek a Refuge in the Waters, others take their Flight to foreign Climates, others conceal them|&s;elves in the Holes of old and decay'd Buildings, in the Sand, and in their own Ne&s;ts; and that others finding a Decay of Strength in their Pa&s;|&s;age to other Countries, plunge them&s;elves into the Sea, where they remain till the genial Spring rou&s;es their latent Principle of Life and Motion.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Kircher,</HI> in <HI>Mund. &s;ubterran.</HI> Lib. 8. Sect. 4. informs us, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Pelopone&s;us,</HI> and other Territories of the <HI>Archipe|lago,</HI> have told him, that every Year, they ob|&s;erv'd large Quantities of Storks and Swallows flying thro' their Countries from <HI>Egypt</HI> and the
<PB N="21" REF="23">Coa&s;ts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> and that the&s;e latter when fatigu'd with flying, plac'd them&s;elves, to the number of five or &s;ix, on the Back of a Stork, whom they recompens'd by an uninterrupted and melodious Song. There, are, therefore, continues the Au|thor, &s;ome Swallows which fly from one Country to another; but 'tis equally certain from Expe|rience, that the Swallows of cold Climates make no &s;uch Voyages; but during the Winter conceal them&s;elves in Caves, Lakes, Rivers, Seas, and the Cavities of Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> in Lib. 15. Chap. 10. informs us, that &s;uch Swallows as are taken out of the Water before the due Time, do not live long; and adds, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Tivoli,</HI> when &s;hewing him Mount <HI>Sci&s;&s;o,</HI> which Name it receives from a fooli&s;h Report of its being divided at the Crucifixion of our Saviour, a&s;&s;ur'd him, that in the Winter-Sea&s;on, large Quantities of Swallows apparently dead were to be found on it; where|as no &s;uch Animals are to be found there in Summer. He then quotes <HI>Cy&s;atus,</HI> who in his De&s;cription of <HI>Switzerland</HI> affirms, that about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> &s;ome Workmen when digging up the Earth for laying the Foundation of a public Edi|fice, found a &s;ubterraneous Cave, from which flew about twenty or more Swallows. Whence the Au|thor concludes, that all the&s;e Birds do not pa&s;s the Sea at their Di&s;appearance, but that &s;ome re|tire into the Cavities of Mountains, others in Hol|low-Trees; but that this mo&s;t frequently happens in northerly Climates.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunus Licetus,</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Feriis Altric. Animal. Di&s;p.</HI> 19. affirms, that in upper <HI>Poland,</HI> every Per&s;on may be experimentally convinc'd, that the
<PB N="22" REF="24">&s;ame Swallows which in Summer build their Ne&s;ts upon the Tops of Hou&s;es, towards the End of <HI>September</HI> plunge them&s;elves into Ditches and Ri|vers, where they remain conceal'd till about the Middle of <HI>May.</HI> He, al&s;o, informs us, that when the Inhabitants &s;eeing Fi&s;h thro' the Ice, break it in order to catch them, they al&s;o frequently find Clu&s;ters of Swallows adhering to each other, with|out di&s;covering the &s;malle&s;t Signs of Life, till they are brought to a Stove, where they &s;oon re|turn to Life. But what is &s;till more remarkable is, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Polanders,</HI> who imagine it unlawful to kill the&s;e Swallows, &s;et them at Li|berty, they forthwith fly back to the Water, and plunge them&s;elves into it.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Huet,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Avranches,</HI> who travell'd thro' <HI>Sweden,</HI> informs us, that be|tween <HI>Caen</HI> and the Sea, along the Shore of the River <HI>Orne,</HI> there are many Caves, in which, dur|ing the Winter, have been found large Clu&s;ters of Swallows, &s;u&s;pended like &s;o many Bunches of Grapes; and that the like was long ago ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Italy.</HI> For <HI>Pedo Albinovanus,</HI> in the Elegy he com|pos'd on the Death of <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> &s;peaks of the Re|treat of the Swallows to the Rocks, as an infalli|ble Sign of the Approach of Winter.</P>
<Q><L>"Congelantur Aquae, &s;copulis &s;e condit Hirundo,</L>
<L>"Verberat egeledas garrula vere Lacus."</L></Q>
<P><HI>Bodin,</HI> quoted by <HI>Camerarius, Cant.</HI> 7. <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 71. informs us, in the &s;econd Book of his <HI>Theatre of Nature,</HI> that when the People who inhabit the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Baltic</HI> Sea, are employ'd among the Rocks in &s;earching for yellow Amber, they fre|quently
<PB N="23" REF="25">find large Clu&s;ters of Swallows. <HI>Camera|rius</HI> &s;ubjoins, that &s;ome Authors affirm, that <Q>"Swal|lows conceal them&s;elves in the Bottom of the Sea, where they &s;leep till the Appearance of a proper Sea&s;on for their quitting it; but this is impo&s;&s;ible &s;ince they have Lungs, and for that Rea&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h in &s;uch a Con|dition."</Q> But however &s;pecious and conclu&s;ive this Rea&s;oning of <HI>Camerarius</HI> may appear, yet 'tis certain that the Truth of Facts, which have actual|ly happened, can never be invalidated.</P>
<P><HI>Franci&s;eus de Frankenau</HI> in his Medicinal Satyres, confirms this Opinion with Re&s;pect to Swallows, by the Authorities of <HI>Lauremberg,</HI> in <HI>Acer. Philol.</HI> Lib. 3. Cap. 71; of <HI>I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> in his <HI>Append. de Lucis Natur.</HI> Cap. 1; of <HI>Deu&s;ingius,</HI> in <HI>Vindict. Faet.</HI> Sect. 5; and of <HI>Fournier,</HI> in his Geography, who in Part 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 5. informs us, that they are commonly found in the <HI>Norwegian</HI>-Seas, as al&s;o in the Lakes and Rivers of <HI>Sile&s;ia, Po|land, Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Moravia;</HI> and that in the Be|ginning of the Autumn, large Numbers of them plunge them&s;elves into Wells. The &s;ame Author, al&s;o, e&s;tabli&s;hes his own Opinion by the additional Suffrages of <HI>Cromerus,</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;t. Polon,</HI> Lib. 1; of <HI>Hevelius;</HI> of <HI>Marcellus Donatus,</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;t. Med. Memorab.</HI> Lib. 4. Cap. 12. and of <HI>Helvicius,</HI> in his Epigrams.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mr. <HI>Falconet,</HI> who&s;e Judgment and Veracity render his &s;ingle Word a &s;ufficient Evidence, informs us, that being in the Hou&s;e of a Gentleman of <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> in the Winter Sea&s;on, he &s;aw a Servant bring in a Kind of Ma&s;s or Lump, which appeared to be Earth, and which &s;ome Fi&s;hermen had caught in their Nets. By wa&s;hing it carefully,
<PB N="24" REF="26">in order to di&s;cover what it was, it was found to be a Group of Swallows, which re&s;um'd Life by being expos'd to the Fire for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Swallows are not the only Birds which conceal them&s;elves in the Bottoms of Rivers, in order to pa&s;s the Winter; for <HI>John Bapti&s;te de Fulgo&s;a,</HI> for|merly Doge of <HI>Genoa,</HI> affirms, that <HI>Gervas Tibel|lerius,</HI> wrote to <HI>Otho</HI> the Fourth, that &s;ome Per|&s;ons having thrown their Nets into a River of that Country in the Winter Time, they brought to Land a large Quantity of Storks, which were ap|parently dead, with their Beaks fix'd in each other's Fundament; but they were &s;oon re&s;tor'd to Life, by means of Heat. The &s;ame Author adds, that in 1467, near <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> a large Number of apparently dead Storks were found in a River, and that being put into a warm Bath, they recover'd Life.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> in <HI>Append. de Lucis Natur.</HI> informs us, that at the Approach of Winter, Storks, Herons, and &s;ome other Birds of the like Nature, do not fly to <HI>Egypt,</HI> or into more temperate Cli|mates, but plunge them&s;elves into Ditches and Mar&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Po&s;&s;ibility of retaining Life for a long Time under Water, is &s;till farther evinc'd, by con&s;idering tho&s;e Birds with which our Fields and Fore&s;ts are richly &s;tock'd in Summer; but which are not to be &s;een in Winter. If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the&s;e, dur|ing the Winter, live upon the Stores they have ama&s;s'd in the Summer; I an&s;wer, that they are by no Means provident again&s;t future Want. Hence they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conceal them&s;elves, in Places &s;uited to their particular Natures; and as it is equally im|po&s;&s;ilble for them, as for the human Species, to live
<PB N="25" REF="27">awake without Aliments, 'tis more than probable that during the whole Winter, they are, as it were, lock'd up in &s;o lethargic a Sleep, that they &s;u&s;tain no Lo&s;s or Di&s;&s;ipation of their Fluids, and con&s;e|quently require no Reparation.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be a&s;k'd, whether the&s;e Animals, during &s;uch a State, retain a real Principle of Life? I an&s;wer, that the Thing is not only probable, but may be al&s;o evinc'd from Fact and Experience, &s;ince the mo&s;t celebrated natural Hi&s;torians and Phy&s;icians give us &s;trong and uncontroverted In|&s;tances of this Kind. Thus in <HI>Ephemerid. Nat. Cu|rio&s;.</HI> we are inform'd, that a certain Gentleman in the Winter Sea&s;on, order'd an hollow Trunk of a Sallow Tree, which by his Direction had been cut down the preceding Autumn, to be laid on the Fire; but a &s;mall Portion of it happening to be left in a Corner of the Room, he had the Curio&s;ity to examine it, and upon his doing &s;o, found Fea|thers arrang'd and di&s;pos'd in a natural Manner: The&s;e he gently pluck'd off, and underneath found the Fle&s;h of a &s;mall Bird which he believ'd to be dead, though he could not di&s;cover to what Spe|cies it belonged. However, with re&s;pect to this Circum&s;tance, he was &s;oon undeceiv'd; for having expos'd it to the Influence of the Fire, it &s;oon di&s;|cover'd palpable Signs of Life. Something &s;imi|lar and analogous to this, no doubt, happens with re&s;pect to many of tho&s;e Quadrupeds which inha|bit our Fore&s;ts, for Want of a Nouri&s;hment pro|per to give their Blood that Degree of Fluidity, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to its Circulation, &s;ince it is certain, that a far &s;maller Number is to be &s;een in Winter than in Summer.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Examples of an apparent Death in Birds who&s;e Blood is warm, we have no Rea&s;on to be &s;urpriz'd at <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> when he affirms, that in
<PB N="26" REF="28">the Winter Time, Fi&s;hes not only appear dead, but are con&s;equently cover'd over with a Cru&s;t of Ice in their Holes, without having the vital Prin|ciple de&s;troy'd in them; for they begin to live a|fre&s;h, when the Heat of the Atmo&s;phere, or an artificial Fire, melts the Ice. The like, continues the Author, happens to Serpents, Toads, Frogs, Tortoi|&s;es, and in a Word all amphibious Animals, when the Cold in&s;pi&s;&s;ates their Juices; which being naturally vi&s;cid, are con&s;equently more proper to prevent the Di&s;&s;ipation of that vital Spirit, which is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore them to Life.</P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e Fi&s;hes which have been thus frozen, do not long &s;urvive their artificial Re&s;titution to Life; becau&s;e the Fro&s;t having al|ter'd the Principles of their Blood, the vital Spirit, when beginning to act and unfold it&s;elf, can no longer form a Ma&s;s of Fluids of an uniform Na|ture. Thus Wine when frozen, and artificially thaw'd, contracts a di&s;agreeable Flavour, becau&s;e the Solution being procur'd in an unnatural Man|ner, hinders the &s;pirituous Part of the Wine from mixing with its other Principles, in the &s;ame Or|der and Proportion as before.</P>
<P>What <HI>Pechlinus</HI> advances with Re&s;pect to Fi&s;hes, is entirely conformable to the Opinion of <HI>Theo|phra&s;tus,</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Pi&s;cibus in &s;iceo degeritibus,</HI> where we are inform'd, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Pontus,</HI> frequently find Fi&s;hes in the Ice, which di&s;cover no Signs either of Motion or Sen&s;ation, till they are put into a Fi&s;h-Back, or laid among Straw. This Circum&s;tance, according to <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> happens particularly to the Gudgeon, and &s;ome other Fi&s;hes of a &s;imilar Nature.</P>
<P>The last Proof of the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Per&s;on's retaining a Principle of Life for a long Time under Water, without a Supply of Aliments for the
<PB N="27" REF="29">Purpo&s;es of Nutrition, is drawn from a Con&s;idera|tion of &s;ome Quadaupeds, as the Hedge-Hog, the Marmotte, the Dormou&s;e, and &s;ome others, which in the Beginning of Winter concealing them&s;elves in the Earth, are &s;eiz'd with &s;o pro|found a Sleep that they appear to be dead, &s;ince neither the Pul&s;ation of their Arteries, nor their Re&s;piration are perceptible. This Circum&s;tance, no doubt, induc'd the celebrated <HI>Harvey</HI> in <HI>Lib. de Generat. Animal. Exercit.</HI> 50&punc; to &s;peak in the following Manner: <Q>"Some &s;anguineous Animals live long without any Pul&s;e, and lie conceal'd during the Whole of the Winter, notwith&s;tand|ing which they remain alive, tho' their Heart retains no Motion, and their Re&s;piration &s;tops, ju&s;t as it happens to Per&s;ons attack'd with Sin|copes, and hy&s;teric Fits, who&s;e Pul&s;e is totally a|boli&s;h'd."</Q> Tho' <HI>Harvey</HI> was the glorious Di&s;|coverer of the Circulation of the Blood, and may for that Rea&s;on be &s;uppos'd to be a keen Advo|cate in its Behalf, yet 'tis &s;ufficiently obvious from this Pa&s;&s;age, that he did not believe it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation of Life. But <HI>Pechli|nus,</HI> whether from Prejudice, or rational Deducti|ons from what he had ob&s;erv'd, is of Opinion, that in the&s;e Animals, Re&s;piration is carried on, by a Motion of the Diaphragm, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible as to e&s;cape the Eye of the Ob&s;erver. He al&s;o ob&s;erves, that in this State, it is nece&s;&s;ary their Re&s;piration &s;hould be &s;uch, becau&s;e if it was perform'd in the u&s;ual Manner, the Motion of the Blood would be &s;o likewi&s;e; in con&s;equence of which, the Tran&s;|piration and Nece&s;&s;ity for Aliments would be e|qually &s;trong; a Circum&s;tance incompatible with the Condition of the&s;e Animals, which lie hid un|der the Earth during the whole Winter.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="30">
<P>Tho' the&s;e Relations may po&s;&s;ibly appear very &s;ingular and &s;urpri&s;ing to Per&s;ons unacquainted with Natural Hi&s;tory; yet they infallibly prove, that in the brute Creation at lea&s;t, Re&s;piration, the Circulation of the Blood, and Pul&s;ation of the Ar|teries may cea&s;e for a long Time, without the total Extinction and Destruction of Life. Now is it not highly probable, or rather ab&s;olutely certain, that &s;omething &s;imilar and analogous to this may happen to human Creatures, who have the Misfor|tune to be drown'd, &s;ince in both, the Solids and Fluids act and move by the &s;ame Laws, &s;o in both Suffocation mu&s;t be the &s;ame Thing, and con&s;e|quently its Effects remov'd by the &s;ame Means?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is by no Means any Rea&s;on for believing, that an In&s;tance of this &s;urpr&s;ing Ab&s;ti|nence and Want of Food, prodnc'd by &s;uch a pro|found and lethargic Sleep, as that of the Marmotte, is not to be found among the human Species; for in <HI>Mi&s;cellan. Academ. Natur. Curio&s;. An.</HI> 8. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 67. the celebrated <HI>Ludovicus,</HI> fir&s;t Phy&s;ician to the Duke of <HI>Saxe-Gotha</HI> informs us, that a young Girl, who for &s;ome Fault &s;he had committed being ap|prehen&s;ive of a &s;evere Cha&s;ti&s;ement from her Pa|rents, retir'd to the mo&s;t conceal'd Part of a Thicket, where, &s;even Days after her Elopement, &s;he was found lying on her Belly with all the ap|parent Signs of Death, except that her Limbs were &s;till flexible and pliant; her Vi&s;age was over&s;pread with a vi&s;cid Phlegm, which was co|ver'd with an hoary Kind of Down, and with the falling Leaves which had adher'd to it. Her Mouth and No&s;trils were entirely full of a thick Mucus: But notwithstanding the&s;e &s;eemingly di&s;|couraging Circum&s;tances, the Phy&s;ician call'd to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, order'd her Body to be warm'd by Means of Friction; Then, with warm Water,
<PB N="29" REF="31">wa&s;hing away the Phlegm which cover'd her Face, and the vi&s;cid Mucus which ob&s;tructed her Mouth and No&s;trils, he pour'd into her Mouth a Spoon|ful of Brandy, which &s;eem'd to go down her Throat, and was the only Cordial he had at hand. Upon exhibiting a &s;econd Spoonful, &s;he fetch'd a Sigh, and a third made her open her Eyes.</P>
<P>We now proceed, to con&s;ider the mo&s;t proper and efficacious Mea&s;ure to be taken for the Relief of drown'd Per&s;ons; for which Purpo&s;e we &s;hall previou&s;ly inve&s;tigate and a&s;certain the genuine Cau&s;e of Suffocation.</P>
<P>Not only the antient Schools of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Ara|bia,</HI> but al&s;o mo&s;t of the &s;ucceeding Phy&s;icians, till the Days of <HI>Platerus,</HI> imagin'd that the Suffo|cation was produc'd by the Water which enter'd into the Stomach, Brea&s;t, and Lungs; in Con&s;e|quence of which fal&s;e Notion they thought them|&s;elves fully authoriz'd to attempt its Di&s;charge with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition. For this Purpo&s;e they order'd drown'd Per&s;ons to be &s;u&s;pended by the Feet, or laid upon their Bellies, on a Hog&s;head or Tub, which was to be agitated from one Side to the other, imagining that by this Po&s;ition, the Abdomen and Brea&s;t being compre&s;s'd, and the Head hanging down, the Agitation of the Ve&s;&s;el, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily facilitate the Evacuation of the Water, which they &s;uppos'd was al&s;o fa|vour'd by the declining Situation of the &s;uperior Part of the Body. With the &s;ame Intention, they al&s;o order'd &s;uch Mea&s;ures as had a Tendency to excite Vomiting.</P>
<P>But as a fal&s;e Theory never fails to lay a Foun|dation for a dangerous Practice, &s;o we have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to condemn this Method of Su&s;pen&s;ion, or hanging by the Heels; for the Water &s;wallow'd by drowning Per&s;ons de&s;cends into the Stomach,
<PB N="30" REF="32">and not into the Thorax, &s;o that it cannot prevent their Recovery. This Circum&s;tance mu&s;t happen, not only &s;o long as a Per&s;on retains a Sen&s;e of his State and Condition, but al&s;o afterwards; for as the Water is hinder'd from entring into the Arte|ria Trachaea and Lungs by a mechanical Effort, in which Rea&s;on has no &s;hare, &s;o the Lungs may in this State be compar'd to an empty Bottle plung'd in Water, into which the Fluid does not enter, be|cau&s;e the Air it contains re&s;i&s;ts its Acce&s;s, and this the rather happens, becau&s;e the Motion of the Brea&s;t, de&s;tin'd to attract the Air, at that Time, totally cea&s;es, and con&s;equently nothing forces the Water to enter and fill up its Place. This Doc|trine is not only evinc'd from the Structure of the Parts, but al&s;o confirm'd by Experience.</P>
<P>Thus the learned <HI>Platerus,</HI> in <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 5. po&s;itive|ly affirms, that if drown'd Per&s;ons &s;wallow any Water, the Quantity of it is too &s;mall to prove mortal to them; becau&s;e he always found but ve|ry little of it in their Stomachs. He al&s;o adds, that mo&s;t of the Water which appears to be di&s;|charg'd from the Mouths of Per&s;ons &s;u&s;pended by the Heels, really flow'd from their Cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Nymman,</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Vita foet. in Utero,</HI> &s;peaks thus, <Q>"Who could believe that a Foetus &s;o long included in the Uterus, where it moves all its Limbs, &s;hould yet never move its Jaw-bone, nor open its Mouth. Be&s;ides, it always has its No&s;trils open, notwith&s;tanding which it has ne|ver been ob&s;erv'd that the Liquor of the Am|nios has enter'd its Body. Thus it is with the Human Foetus, as with tho&s;e who are drown'd, &s;ince in di&s;&s;ecting many of the&s;e la&s;t, I have hardly found a Pint of Water in their Bodies."</Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>Mi&s;cellan. Nat. Curio&s;. An.</HI> 2. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 251. <HI>Wepfer,</HI> gives an Account of the Anatomy of
<PB N="31" REF="33">&s;ome Beavers, one of which was drown'd. The Author having open'd the <HI>Arteria Trachaea,</HI> no Water was di&s;charg'd from the Lungs; but there were about four Ounces of Water, like the Wa&s;h|ings of Fle&s;h, found in the right Cavity of the Brea&s;t, and about three Ounces of the &s;ame Kind in the Left. This Extrava&s;ation the Author ju&s;t|ly &s;uppo&s;es produc'd by the Expre&s;&s;ion of a bloody Lymph from the Pores of the Bronchia of this Animal, which had for a long Time &s;truggled a|gain&s;t &s;o violent a Death as that of Drowning. Neither pure Water nor Water ting'd with Blood, were ob&s;erv'd either in the <HI>Arteria Trachaea,</HI> or in the <HI>Bronchia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bhonius,</HI> in the Appendix to his Treati&s;e <HI>de Re|nuntiat. Vuln. Di&s;&s;.</HI> 2. informs us, that in di&s;&s;ect|ing a great many Women drown'd for murdering their Children, he had &s;hewn the Spectators, that there was little or no Water in their Lungs and Abdomen; and adds, that in order to render him|&s;elf more certain with Re&s;pect to this Circum&s;tance, he had, drown'd &s;everal Animals, in who&s;e Cavities, tho' drown'd alive, he had never perceiv'd any Water.</P>
<P><HI>Dethardingius,</HI> at pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or of Medicine in <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> in a Letter wrote when he was Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Ro&s;toch,</HI> in 1714, gives us an Account of the Di&s;&s;ection of a Soldier, who attempting to make his E&s;cape from a Garri&s;on, was drown'd in a Ditch, and upon being open'd had in his Sto|mach only about a Pint of Beer, which he had drank &s;ome Time before. The Profe&s;&s;or took care previou&s;ly to appri&s;e the Spectators, that there would not be a &s;ingle Drop of Water in his Brea&s;t, which as well as his Abdomen, was very much elevated; and the Event verified the Pre|diction.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="34">
<P><HI>Johannes Conradus Becker,</HI> in his Treati&s;e <HI>de Submer&s;. Mort. Sin. Pot. Aq.</HI> gives us the four following Hi&s;tories. A Dog, &s;ays he, being drown'd and lying in the Water for an Hour, his Abdomen, Stomach, and Inte&s;tines, appear'd tu|mified and inflated, tho' a &s;ingle Drop of Water was not found in them. The Lungs were, al&s;o, inflated, without containing Water, like tho&s;e of hang'd Per&s;ons, but immediately collaps'd upon &s;uffering the Air to e&s;cape thro' an Inci&s;ion made in the <HI>Arteria Traehaea.</HI> The Author &s;ubjoins, that this Ob&s;ervation render'd the Doctrine of the An|tients highly &s;u&s;pected by him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, is the Hi&s;tory of a Pea&s;ant, taken from the Water, after he had been &s;ome Weeks in it, and was entirely putrified. After opening his Duodenum, two Ligatures were made on that In|te&s;tine, which was very much inflated, and from the Aperture of which nothing was di&s;charg'd, but a Liquor which was Chyle mix'd with Beer, of which the Pea&s;ant had, at a Market, drank &s;o li|berally, as to intoxicate him&s;elf. The Tumefacti|on of the Stomach, laid a Foundation for &s;u&s;pect|ing that it contain'd a large Quantity of Water, tho' upon laying it open, nothing was found but a Pint of a Liquor, who&s;e Smell exactly re&s;em|bled that of Beer. The Lungs were &s;o much in|flated, that when an Inci&s;ion was made in the Brea&s;t, they bur&s;t out; but their Inflation was &s;peedily di&s;|&s;ipated, by making an Aperture in the <HI>Arteria Trachea,</HI> thro' which the Air was di&s;charg'd with a con&s;iderable Noi&s;e. In cutting the Lungs into Pieces, no extraordinary Signs of Humidity were perceiv'd, nor were any preternatural Circum|&s;tances ob&s;erv'd, except Spots of different Colours.</P>
<P>The third Hi&s;tory, is that of a Woman drown'd in a Well, in who&s;e Inte&s;tines nothing but Chyle
<PB N="33" REF="35">was di&s;cover'd, neither was there any Water in the Lungs. The Inte&s;tines collaps'd upon making a &s;mall Puncture in them, and an Aperture being made in the Arteria Trachea, the Air e&s;cap'd thro' it from the Lungs with &s;ome Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t Hi&s;tory related by <HI>Becker,</HI> is that of a Man who was found &s;tanding upright in a Ba&s;on, where he had remain'd under Water for five Days. His Stomach, which was large, was only inflated with Wind, and hardly contain'd &s;ix Ounces of a whiti&s;h Liquor. The Lungs being equally inflated, collaps'd upon cutting the Arteria Trachea, from which the Air was di&s;charg'd with a con&s;iderable Noi&s;e. When he was found, two Spoonfuls of Water were not di&s;charg'd from his Mouth. <Q>"He was, however, continues <HI>Becker,</HI> every where &s;urrounded with Water, but that Element, notwith&s;tanding the Minutene&s;s of its Parts, could not penetrate into the Arte|ria Trachea and Oe&s;ophagus, in order to fill the Cavities of the Vi&s;cera; an evident Proof that the&s;e Parts were &s;o defended again&s;t every Thing that made an Attempt to enter them, that the Water it&s;elf could not force a Pa&s;&s;age into them."</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, the celebrated Author concludes, that the Ab&s;ence of Water in the Lungs and Inte&s;tines, is not a Proof that a Per&s;on has been thrown into the Water after his Death. This Ob&s;ervation is of the la&s;t Importance to tho&s;e who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to make Reports before Courts of Ju|dicature, tho' it is contrary to that of <HI>Rodericus &agrave; Ca&s;tro,</HI> adopted by many Philologi&s;ts and Crimi|nali&s;ts, and among others by <HI>Feltman</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Ca|davero in&s;piciendo,</HI> Cap. 21. But as in the Opinion of <HI>Becker,</HI> the Lungs are not inflated in tho&s;e who are thrown into the Water after Death, &s;o we may
<PB N="34" REF="36">from their Inflation draw a Proof, that the Per&s;on was alive when drown'd, or put into the Water.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, it is &s;ufficiently obvious, both from the Structure of the Parts, and the Authori|ties of the mo&s;t penetrating Anatomi&s;ts, that little or no Water enters the Bodies of drown'd Per&s;ons, &s;o 'tis equally obvious, that the Practice of hang|ing by the Heels, is not only u&s;ele&s;s, but mu&s;t al&s;o contribute to de&s;troy tho&s;e Remains of Life which may po&s;&s;ibly be lo&s;t; for by &s;uch a Su&s;pen&s;ion, the whole Column of the Blood convey'd to the Heart by the inferior <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> will nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;s upon that convey'd by the &s;uperior <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> where the Blood being interrupted in its Cour&s;e, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily regurgitate into the jugular Veins, and con&s;e|quently into the Head, where, by its Quantity and Weight, it retards the Motion of the Spirits, who&s;e free Progre&s;s is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore the Cir|culation of the Blood, on which Life in a great Mea&s;ure depends.</P>
<P>As it is of great Importance, to know the Cau&s;e of the Inflation of drown'd Per&s;ons, &s;ince it is not produc'd by the Water they &s;wallow, &s;o the learn|ed <HI>Dethardingius</HI> accounts for it in the following manner, <Q>"Tho&s;e, &s;ays he, who die in the Water, are not de&s;troy'd for Want of Air, but by means of too large a Quantity of it; they do not die in Expiration, but in In&s;piration; and in a Word, nothing more re&s;embles each In|&s;piration, than the Phaenomena ob&s;erv'd in drown'd Per&s;ons; for if we attentively con&s;ider what happens to our&s;elves, we perceive that the Brea&s;t is as it were lengthen'd, the Abdomen elevated, and the Flanks inflated, and that this State &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, &s;o long as we draw in the Air, or retain it in the Brea&s;t. Now the &s;ame Things happen in drown'd Per&s;ons, only with this Dif|ference,
<PB N="35" REF="37">that in the latter, the In&s;piration is perform'd with Rapidity and Violence, whereas in the former it is carried on quietly and without any Effort. In Per&s;ons not drown'd, a Depre&s;|&s;ion &s;ucceeds the Elevation; but in drown'd Per&s;ons the Elevation of the Abdomen, and the Elongation of the Brea&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t; by which means, all the Parts continue in a State of Expan&s;ion. This is, no doubt, the Meaning of tho&s;e, who look upon the Death of drown'd Per&s;ons as a Suffocation, and pretend that the Cau&s;e of it, and that of &s;trangled Per&s;ons is the &s;ame; for tho&s;e two Kinds of Death have a great Re&s;em|blance and Analogy, as is &s;ufficiently obvious from the Elevation of the Abdomen, which in hang'd Per&s;ons &s;ub&s;i&s;ts after their Death."</Q></P>
<P>From this Theory 'tis &s;ufficiently ea&s;y to con|ceive, that the Inflation of the Lungs, is the Cau&s;e of the Death of drown'd Per&s;ons; accordingly <HI>Dethardingius</HI> from the preceding Doctrine draws the following Conclu&s;ions; <Q>"The Ve&s;icules of the Lungs are inflated by the Air, the Bronchia are lengthen'd, the Blood Ve&s;&s;els di&s;tributed thro' the whole Body of the Lungs, are com|pre&s;s'd; and tho' the Elongation of the Bron|chia a&s;&s;i&s;ts the Entry of the Blood into the large Ve&s;&s;els, as well tho&s;e proper to the Lungs, as the bronchial Artery and Vein, as tho&s;e which are only &s;ub&s;ervient to the Circulation, as the pulmonary Artery and Vein, yet the Circulation is not carried on equally in the Capillaries; &s;ince the Pre&s;ence of a rarified Air in the Ve&s;icules compre&s;&s;es the Blood, and forcing it to &s;top there, hinders it from pa&s;&s;ing into the Left Ven|tricle of the Heart, in order to accompli&s;h the Circulation. Now as &s;oon as there is a con&s;i|derable Retardation in this important Function,
<PB N="36" REF="38">the vital Motions al&s;o gradually cea&s;e, and Death approaches in&s;en&s;ibly."</Q></P>
<P>After having thus di&s;cover'd the Rea&s;on of the Inflation of the Lungs, and of the Death which &s;ucceeds that Circum&s;tance, we &s;hall, with the &s;ame Author, inve&s;tigate the Cau&s;e which hinders the Di&s;charge of the Air from the Lungs and Brea&s;t. This is by no means a Topic of pure Cu|rio&s;ity, &s;ince, the A&s;&s;i&s;tance to be afforded to drown'd Per&s;ons&punc; can be of no Service, except in &s;o far as it is proper to remove tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles, which oppo&s;e and hinder the re&s;pective Actions of the viral Functions. Now <HI>Dethardingius</HI> and <HI>Becker</HI> pretend, that the <HI>Epiglottis,</HI> (which is a &s;mall Valve plac'd at the external Entrance of the Larynx, in order by its covering the Glottis, to hinder all &s;olid or liquid Bodies which may be put into the Mouth, from de&s;cending into the Canal of Re&s;piration) being exactly and &s;trongly applied over the Glottis, proves the Ob&s;tacle to the Di&s;charge of the Air from the Lungs. The&s;e Authors, al&s;o, affirm that &s;uch a &s;trong and convul&s;ive Application of the Epiglottis over the Glottis, ari&s;es from a pre|ternatural Exten&s;ion of the Fibres of tho&s;e Mem|branes of the Larinx, which cover the Epiglottis. This preternatural Exten&s;ion they attribute to the violent In&s;piration excited by Fear, in Per&s;ons who run a Ri&s;k of being drown'd. Thus the incom|parable <HI>Dethardingius</HI> rea&s;ons in the following Manner: <Q>"If in all Kinds of Dread and Terror we ob&s;erve, that Re&s;piration is di&s;order'd; that is to &s;ay, that In&s;piration is more quick, and la&s;ts longer; and that, on the contrary, Expiration is intercepted, uncertain, and &s;hort, it follows of Cour&s;e, that In&s;piration mu&s;t be much more &s;trong, and the Air attracted in a far larger Quantity, when a Per&s;on perceives that he is
<PB N="37" REF="39">threatn'd with Death by the Water, which mu&s;t in a Moment fill the Space which ought to be occupied by the Air."</Q></P>
<P>It is pretty &s;urpri&s;ing that <HI>Becker</HI> and <HI>Dethar|dingius</HI> &s;hould only rea&s;on conjecturally in this Af|fair; &s;ince the Di&s;&s;ections they made of drown'd Per&s;ons, might have enabled them by their Eyes to judge of the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Epiglottis</HI> in the&s;e unfortunate Creatures. But, be this as it will; certain it is that <HI>Dethardingius</HI>'s Method of afford|ing Relief to drown'd Per&s;ons, is highly rational, and promi&s;es fair for re&s;toring them to Life. It con&s;i&s;ts in four Things; the fir&s;t of which is, to place the Body drawn from the Water in a proper Po&s;ture and Situation. The Second is to compre&s;s the Abdomen, at the &s;ame Time that Frictions are making on the Back. The Third is, to excite an Irritation in the Throat; and the Fourth to make an Inci&s;ion in the <HI>Arteria Trachea.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Situation of the Per&s;on taken from the Water, we have already &s;hewn Su&s;pen&s;ion by the Heels to be prejudicial; tho' <HI>Becker</HI> recommends it, becau&s;e he thinks the Weight of the abdominal Vi|&s;cera may thru&s;t the Diaphragm into the Brea&s;t, com|pre&s;s the Lungs, and giving a greater Spring to the Air, make it act with &s;uch an Effort, as to rai&s;e the <HI>Epiglottis:</HI> But the judicious <HI>Dethardingius,</HI> &s;en|&s;ible that this Method is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy Re|&s;piration in Per&s;ons alive, ab&s;olutely condemns it, and orders drown'd People to be laid with their Bodies &s;o declining, as that the Head may be lowe&s;t. Be&s;ides, as he had ob&s;erv'd that Re&s;pira|tion is more difficultly perform'd on the Belly, he directs drown'd Per&s;ons to be laid on their Backs, and a &s;trong Compre&s;&s;ion of the Abdomen to be made, from the Region of the Pubes, as far up as
<PB N="38" REF="40">the Stomach. He adds, that it is expedient, both for the Sake of the Frictions and the Compre&s;&s;ion, to rub the Hands with &s;ome Oil, proper to re&s;tore to the Fibres render'd rigid by the Cold and Spa&s;ms, that Supplene&s;s and pliant State, which is nece&s;&s;ary to them in order to perform the Mo|tions of Re&s;piration.</P>
<P><HI>Pechlinus</HI> ob&s;erves, that in <HI>Sweden</HI> it is cu&s;toma|ry to u&s;e Frictions on Per&s;ons taken out of the Water, and externally to apply hot and &s;pirituous Remedies in order to reanimate the internal Heat, and more effectually excite the Efferve&s;cence of the Blood. <HI>Borelli,</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;t.

Mr. <HI>Joly,</HI> a Phy&s;i|cian of <HI>Britany,</HI> in the Ob&s;ervations in&s;erted in the Hi&s;torical Journal, for the Month of <HI>Novem|ber</HI> 1743, advi&s;es Frictions before a large Fire with hot Cloths, with a View to re&s;tore the Per|&s;on to Heat as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. <HI>Dethardingius</HI> or|ders the&s;e Frictions to be made from the Nape of the Neck down to the Buttocks, becau&s;e, the Heads of the Mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to Expiration, are attach'd to the Spine of the Back, and their Tendors to the Ribs; and becau&s;e, in his Opinion, Friction facilitates the Action of the&s;e Mu&s;cles, e&s;pecially when made with Oils, which contribute to re&s;tore the Plyancy of the Fibres.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Frictions before a Fire, with hot Cloths &s;oak'd in Oils or &s;pirituous Liquors, are beneficial in another Re&s;pect, becau&s;e, the Spine of the Back is the Origin of a great Number of Nerves and con&s;equently of the various Motions perform'd in the Body. This cannot fail to put all the vital Springs in Action; by re&s;toring Supplene&s;s to the nervous and mu&s;cular Fibres, and Motion to the
<PB N="39" REF="41">flow circulating, or even totally coagulated Juices, This is the Rea&s;on, why Frictions and Pumping &s;o often prove &s;ucce&s;sful in Apoplexies.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t, al&s;o, ob&s;erve, that <HI>Dethardingius,</HI> approves of laying drown'd Per&s;ons on their Bel|lies over a Hog&s;head, or round Ve&s;&s;el, which is to be agitated, not with a View to make them di&s;|charge the Water they have &s;wallow'd, but to &s;hake and compre&s;s the Abdomen, and thru&s;t its Contents towards the Diaphragm.

<P><HI>Dethardingius</HI> &s;eems not to have laid great Stre&s;s upon the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Practice of defending the Bodies of drown'd Per&s;ons from the Contact of the Air, and of conveying them into warm Places. The fir&s;t Step however taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> is, accord|ing to <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> to wrap &s;uch Bodies up in warm Cloths. <HI>Langelotti</HI> al&s;o, in <HI>Mi&s;cel. Nat. Curio&s;. An.</HI> 6. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 20. informs us, that this Method is a|mong them univer&s;ally put in Practice, becau&s;e they have learn'd from long Experience, that no drown'd Per&s;on recovers, if he is left long, ex|pos'd to the free Air, Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> is, al&s;o, of Opi|nion, that drown'd Per&s;ons &s;hould be left upon the Shore no longer, than is nece&s;&s;ary to pull off their Cloths, which may be cut off for the Sake of Expedition; <Q>"for, continues he, a &s;ingle Moment
<PB N="40" REF="42">often determines between a State of Death or Life."</Q> In con&s;equence of this Principle, he adopts the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Practice; <Q>"for, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> when the drown'd Per&s;on's Cloths are taken off, he is to be wrapt up in the warme&s;t Coverings or Cloths which can be then had. Then he is to be convey'd to the neare&s;t Hou&s;e, where after Frictions before a warm Fire with hot Cloths, he is to be laid in a very warm Bed. Great Care is to be taken, to apply to his Feet, the Inner-&s;ides of his Thighs, his Houghs, and his Arm-Pits, Flaggons full of boiling Water, wrapt up in linen Cloths."</Q> For the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e we may make u&s;e of Bricks. I mu&s;t, how|ever, ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> recedes from the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Practice, in a Circum&s;tance which to me appears to be of the lea&s;t Importance; for the <HI>Swedes</HI> do not warm the Bodies of drown'd Per|&s;ons &s;uddenly, but by little and little, before a gentle Fire. The Expedience of this may be e|vinc'd by con&s;idering the Effects of a too inten&s;e Heat upon Fi&s;hes found frozen in the Winter Time, which indeed recover for a Moment, and then die irretriveably. <HI>Nymman</HI> and <HI>Ranchin</HI> al&s;o order'd drown'd Per&s;ons to be laid in warm Places, e&s;pecially in Winter.</P>
<P>As in drown'd Per&s;ons, a Defect of re&s;pirable Air produces a Suffocation, &s;o it would be no le&s;s fooli&s;h, than barbarous, &s;uddenly to expo&s;e them to the entire Action of the Atmo&s;phere, &s;ince that Fluid entering precipitately into the Thorax, would produce, in the pulmonary Ve&s;&s;els, a Dila|tation, which in&s;tead of promoting the Pa&s;&s;age of the Blood thro' that Organ, would produce a fre&s;h Ob&s;truction in it, becau&s;e the Action of the Heart is not &s;trong enough, to &s;urmount the Re|&s;i&s;tance which the Air makes to the Pa&s;&s;age of the
<PB N="41" REF="43">Blood; and this mu&s;t the more inevitably happen, becau&s;e the Lungs in &s;uch a State collap&s;e, which is the unavoidable Fate of all Fibres de|priv'd of the Influx of the Animal Spirits, which nece&s;&s;arily depends on the free Conveyance of the Blood thro' the whole Body, and the Velocity of its circular Motion. The Precaution, therefore, of wrapping Per&s;ons taken from the Water in Blankets, is highly proper, and excellently &s;uited not only to this Species of Suffocation, but al&s;o of all others.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;ufficient to guard drown'd Per&s;ons again&s;t the rude Impre&s;&s;ions of the Atmo&s;phere, &s;ince 'tis al&s;o requi&s;ite they &s;hould only be per|mitted the free U&s;e of that Fluid by Degrees.</P>
<P>As the Decrea&s;e of the Circulation is nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceeded by a proportionable Diminution of Heat, &s;o 'tis ju&s;tly to be expected, that the Bodies of drown'd Per&s;ons have lo&s;t the greate&s;t Part of that Warmth, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Support of Life. Hence 'tis ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite they &s;hould be warm'd. But it would be equally pernicious, &s;uddenly to expo&s;e them at once to the Fire, or precipitately to exhibit Medicines, which by the Volatility of their Principles, might produce a Rarefaction of the Blood. 'Tis, therefore, far more &s;afe and prudent, to begin with gradually augmented Frictions of the Extremities with warm Cloths, than all at once to expo&s;e &s;uch Per&s;ons to the Fire, or call in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of hot and vo|latile Medicines, both of which may be &s;afely, tho' &s;paringly and gradually us'd, when the Circula|tion is &s;o re&s;tor'd, that their bad Effects are no longer to be fear'd,</P>
<P>The&s;e Precautions are founded on phy&s;ical Rea|&s;ons, which tho' &s;ufficiently known to Phy&s;icians,
<PB N="42" REF="44">may yet afford fre&s;h Plea&s;ure and Entertainment to Readers of another Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>The Blood, then, of the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> di&s;charges it&s;elf into the right Auricle of the Heart, who&s;e Contraction forces it into the right Ventricle, which in its Turn contracting it&s;elf, propels the Blood into the Pulmonary Artery. That tho&s;e Opera|tions may be perform'd, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary the Quanti|ty of Blood di&s;charg'd into the right Auricle, &s;hould not over-power its Action; that the con|tractile Force of the right Ventricle &s;hould be &s;uf|ficient to propel the Blood in the pulmonary Ar|tery; and that in this Artery there &s;hould be no|thing to ob&s;truct or oppo&s;e the Di&s;tribution of the Blood, which ought to be made in it. Now according to this Theory, the Contractions of the right Auricle and Ventricle, are in &s;uch Ca&s;es ex|tremely weakened, &s;ince the&s;e Mu&s;cles partake of the Relaxation of the whole Sy&s;tem of the Fibres. The Lungs, al&s;o, collap&s;e, and con&s;equently op|po&s;e the free Circulation of the Blood, or its free Di&s;tribution thro' them&s;elves. If, therefore, in affording A&s;&s;i&s;tance to drown'd Per&s;ons, we &s;hould precipitately convey too quick a Motion to the Blood, we &s;hould by that very Circum&s;tance pro|duce invincible Ob&s;tacles to its Circulation, and con&s;equently make the Means of recalling Life &s;ub&s;ervient to the Production of irretreivable Death; for the exce&s;&s;ive Quantity of Blood which enters the right Auricle, will over-power and &s;ur|mount the weak Force which re&s;i&s;ts it. Be&s;ides, tho' this Auricle had contractile Force enough to convey the Blood into the Heart, yet the Action of that Mu&s;cle will not be &s;ufficient to propel the Blood into the Lungs, or at lea&s;t to &s;urmount the joint Re&s;i&s;tance made by the collap&s;ed State of the Lungs, and the Air compre&s;&s;ing their Blood-Ve&s;&s;els.
<PB N="43" REF="45">The&s;e Methods, therefore, of relieving drown'd Per&s;ons and re&s;toring them to Life, are not only founded upon the animal Oeconomy, but are al&s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>'Tis, however, to be ob&s;erv'd, that when the Circulation begins to be carried on freely, we may, if &s;uch Practice is indicated by any pre&s;&s;ing Cir|cum&s;tances, attempt to reduce it to its natural State, by means of Cordials and anti-apoplectic Medicines; tho' the&s;e, e&s;pecially the latter, as being mo&s;t powerful, are in the Beginning to be us'd with the utmo&s;t Caution; and probably the &s;afe&s;t Method is totally to ab&s;tain from the anti-apoplectic Medicines, and to begin with the milde&s;t Cordials, who&s;e mo&s;t energetic Parts being diluted in a large Quantity of &s;ome proper Vehicle, may more in&s;en&s;ibly mix them&s;elves with the Ma&s;s of Blood, and con&s;equently produce their Effects more &s;lowly. 'Tis, however, to be ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;ame Danger is not to be dreaded from the ex|ternal U&s;e of the mo&s;t efficacious Remedies. Thus, for In&s;tance, we need not he&s;itate to apply Topics to the Temples, the No&s;trils, the Wri&s;ts, the Pit of the Stomach, and all tho&s;e Parts, where the Ar|teries lying near the Surface of the Body, are ex|pos'd to their Action and Influence. And as the Membranous Parts are none of the lea&s;t con&s;idera|ble In&s;truments of the &s;everal Motions perform'd in the Body, &s;o a very particular Regard ought to be had to them: Frictions, then, of the Hands and Feet, as well as the Application of &s;pirituous Medicines to the&s;e Parts, are extremely beneficial; for tho' the Propriety of this Practice could not be demon&s;trated from Anatomy and Phy&s;iology, yet we might be fully convinc'd of it, by the Ob&s;er|vation of <HI>Deventer,</HI> who orders Frictions with Bru&s;hes to be made on the Soles of the Feet of
<PB N="44" REF="46">&s;uch new-born Children, as di&s;cover no Signs of Life, in order to re&s;tore the Circulation of the Blood, which is the Foundation or fir&s;t Beginning of it.</P>
<P><HI>Deventer</HI> does not, indeed, advi&s;e the Applica|tion of &s;pirituous Medicines to the&s;e Parts; but as 'tis &s;ufficiently certain, that the&s;e, as well as all other Liquors, penetrate the Surface of the Body, and enter the Cavities of the Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o their ex|ternal Applications mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce very happy Effects. Be&s;ides, this Method of u&s;ing &s;pirituous Medicines, is of all others the &s;afe&s;t; not only becau&s;e their Mixture with the Blood is not &s;o quick as when they are exhibited internally, but al&s;o, becau&s;e, the Parts to which they are ap|plied are mo&s;t remote from the Center.</P>
<P>But we now proceed to con&s;ider the other Me|thods of affording Relief to drown'd Per&s;ons, be|ginning with the Smoke of Tobacco, the happy Ef|fects of which are prov'd by various Ob&s;ervations. Thus Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> in his mechanical Account of Poi&s;ons, after mentioning that many who have been drown'd and dead to all Appearance, have been &s;urpri&s;ingly re&s;tor'd to Life, &s;peaks in the fol|lowing manner, from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences: <Q>"This Circum&s;tance &s;hould certainly encourage the U&s;e of all Means, upon &s;uch Accidents, e&s;pecially as the Trial is not dif|ficult. The fir&s;t Step &s;hould be to blow the Smoke of Tobacco up into the Inte&s;tines, then to warm the Body by &s;haking and rolling about, and rub|bing it with warm Cloths in a Bed. In a Word to put the Blood into Motion all manner of Ways, and not to be di&s;courag'd tho' no Signs of Life &s;hould be di&s;cover'd after an Hour or two &s;hould be &s;pent in this good Work; towards the latter End of which, Spirits and volatile Salts may produce a good Effect. Neither
<PB N="45" REF="47">&s;hould bleeding be omitted when the Blood is become &s;ufficiently warm to drop out of the Veins."</Q></P>
<P>The happy Effects of the Smoke of Tobacco in re&s;toring drown'd Per&s;ons to Life, are farther evinc'd from the following Narration of Dr. <HI>Bru|hier.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> a profe&s;s'd Surgeon of <HI>Paris,</HI> being at <HI>Pa&s;&s;y,</HI> waited in a Boat till the Number it was to take in &s;hould be completed. During this Time, he &s;aw a Boat cro&s;&s;ing the River, and when it arriv'd at Land, one of the Pa&s;&s;engers &s;tepping a&s;hore, and mi&s;&s;ing his Wife, a&s;k'd what was become of her; but no one could give him any An&s;wer, except a young Child, who pointing to the River, &s;aid, &s;he had hid her&s;elf in it. This Wo|man had fallen from the Stern of the Boat, without being perceiv'd by any of the Pa&s;&s;engers, except the Child, who gave Directions to row to the very Part where the Woman fell from the Boat. The Hu&s;band finding her in a Place which was not very deep, but full of Mud, brought her to Land, and laid her out. Whil&s;t &s;ome of the Spectators of this melancholy Accident were advi&s;ing to hang her by the Heels, and others ordering different Mea|&s;ures to be taken, a Soldier with his Pipe in his Mouth, came to a&s;k the Rea&s;on of &s;uch a Concour&s;e of People; upon being inform'd of the Accident, he de&s;ir'd the di&s;con&s;olate Hu&s;band to give over weeping, becau&s;e his Wife would re|turn to Life very &s;oon. Then giving his Pipe to the Hu&s;band, he bid him introduce the &s;mall End of it into the Anus, put a Piece of Paper perforated with a large Number of Holes upon its Mouth, and thro' that blow the Smoke of the Tobacco into her Inter&s;tines, as &s;trongly as he po&s;&s;ibly could. Ac|cordingly at the fifth Bla&s;t, a con&s;iderable rum|bling in the Woman's Abdomen was heard, upon
<PB N="46" REF="48">which &s;he di&s;charg'd &s;ome Water from her Mouth' and in a Moment after return'd to Life. This Practice, however in&s;ignificant in the Eyes of the Vulgar, is neverthele&s;s of the highe&s;t Importance; for the Irritation of the Inte&s;tines, excited by the Heat and Acrimony of the Smoke of the Tobacco, produces in the Mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to Expiration, &s;uch a Reflux of the animal Spirits, as induces a Con|traction of them &s;ufficient to &s;urmount that Re|&s;i&s;tance which the Air contain'd in the Brea&s;t, found to its Di&s;charge. This happy Effect of the Smoke of Tobacco is &s;ufficiently evinc'd by the preceding Hi&s;tory, &s;ince it made the Woman vo|mit up the Water &s;he had &s;wallow'd. Now vo|miting is excited by a &s;timulating Contraction of the Diaphragm, and of the tran&s;ver&s;e Mu&s;cle of the Abdomen, which contracting the Stomach, force it to di&s;charge its Contents, where the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance is found, and con&s;equently by its &s;upe|rior Orifice. It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;ame happy Effects are produc'd by the Smoke of all acrid Sub&s;tances, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> affirms, that the &s;ame End is equally an&s;wer'd by the Smoke of Sage, and other Plants of a &s;imilar Nature. It is al&s;o highly probable, that Cly&s;ters prepar'd with Coloquintida or Tobacco, would produce Effects e|qually good; but on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, the mo&s;t rea|dy and expeditious Mea&s;ures are always to be taken, &s;ince a very &s;mall Delay may prove of the la&s;t Con&s;equence, by de&s;troying a Life which might otherwi&s;e be pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;es of Emergence, where proper In&s;tru|ments are not immediately to be procur'd, the Pre|&s;cription of the Soldier in the preceding Hi&s;tory, may be follow'd; but it may lo&s;e le&s;s Time to co|ver the Tobacco in the Bole of the Pipe, when lighted, with a &s;ilk Handkerchief, either &s;ingle,
<PB N="47" REF="49">or once doubled, than to wait till proper Holes are bor'd in a Piece of Paper, tho' this takes up very little Time. However, that no nece&s;&s;ary In&s;truc|tions might be wanted, I have given the Figure of an In&s;trument; contriv'd on purpo&s;e for impelling the Smoke of Tobacco into the Inte&s;tines. A. re|pre&s;ents a Bra&s;s or Iron Box, capable of containing half an Ounce of the &s;tronge&s;t Tobacco, which is to be lighted. B. is a common Cly&s;ter Pipe, to be introduc'd into the <HI>Anus,</HI> join'd to the flexible Tube D. D. made of Leather. C. is another Pipe, at which a Per&s;on blows forcibly, that the Smoke of the Tobacco in the Box A. may be impell'd thro' the flexible Tube D. D. and the Pipe B. into the In|te&s;tines. E. repre&s;ents the Smoke. If one Cly|&s;ter is not &s;ufficient, another &s;hould be given &s;oon after, and repeated till it an&s;wers.</P>
<P>The&s;e Cly&s;ters of the Fume of Tobacco, are of excellent U&s;e in the Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion, and in an incarce|rated Hernia; and no Apothecary or Surgeon ought to be without &s;uch an In&s;trument.</P>
<P>As the olfactory Nerves are of all others the mo&s;t expos'd to the Action of Bodies, and have an intimate Connection with tho&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient to the Motion of the Mu&s;cles de&s;tin'd for Re&s;piration, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be beneficial to irritate the Nerves of the No&s;e; &s;o that what we call Sternutatories, or &s;uch Sub&s;tances as excite Sneezing, produce happy Effects in re&s;toring drown'd Per&s;ons to Life: <HI>Indian</HI> Marum or Euphorbium introduc'd into the No&s;e, or reduc'd into a Powder and blown up the No&s;trils, will in all Probability produce &s;alu|tary Effects, &s;ince if they operate they will excite a violent Expiration, &s;ufficient to remove all tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles which the Air finds to its free Di&s;charge. Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> warmly recommends this Practice, as al&s;o Injections of &s;pirituous Liquors. Thus the
<PB N="48" REF="50">Injection of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac into the No|&s;trils, operates more powerfully than holding vo|latile Sal Ammoniac to them. Perhaps Vinegar will &s;timulate yet more &s;trongly, and with better Effect.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e Authors who treat of the Mea&s;ures proper for re&s;toring drown'd Per&s;ons to Life, or|der a Vomiting to be excited, in order to procure a Di&s;charge of the Water contain'd in the Stomach. This is the Doctrine of <HI>Codronchus, Fore&s;tus, Ca|merarius,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joly,</HI> who imagines that the Water in the Stomach of drown'd Per&s;ons, is one of the Cau&s;es of their Death. In order to excite this Vomiting, they order the Throat to be tick|led with the bearded End of a Quill. <HI>Becker</HI> and <HI>Dethardingius</HI> order a Feather to be introduc'd into the Oe&s;ophagus, in order to excite &s;uch a Motion of the Epiglottis, as is &s;ufficient to procure a Di&s;|charge of the Air contain'd in the Brea&s;t. Now 'tis &s;ufficiently known to every Body, that the bearded End of a Quill excites Vomiting. We mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Joly</HI> only orders Vo|miting to be procur'd after drown'd Per&s;ons return to Life. But it is certain, that vomiting can pro|duce no happy Effects, if there is nothing in the Stomach, or only a Quantity of Water equal to that daily us'd by mo&s;t People. As for liquid E|metics, their Effects appear to be highly dubious, &s;ince the Oe&s;ophagus may po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;uch a con|vul&s;ive State, as to hinder Deglutition. <HI>Dethar|dingius</HI> looks upon this Irritation of the Throat, as a Circum&s;tance of the highe&s;t Importance; but for exciting it, prefers a certain In&s;trument invented in <HI>Germany,</HI> and de&s;crib'd by <HI>Hei&s;ter</HI> in his Sur|gery.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Pechlinus,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> attempt to re&s;tore the Lives of drown'd Per&s;ons, by Means
<PB N="49" REF="51">of Fomentations, with anti-apoplectic Medicines; that is, &s;uch as are of an hot and &s;pirituous Nature. <HI>Borelli</HI> in <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 11. <HI>Cent.</HI> 2. informs us, that he &s;uc|ce&s;sfully us'd toa&s;ted Bread &s;oak'd in warm Brandy, applied to the Region of the Heart, and frequent|ly renew'd. <HI>Nymman</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Apoplexia. Cap.</HI> 44. orders us to apply to the No&s;trils of drown'd Per|&s;ons, odoriferous Sub&s;tances, and &s;uch as are car|pable of putting the Spirits in Motion, and re|&s;toring the Action of the Heart, and the Functi|ons of the Brain. Of this Kind are Penny-royal Rue; and Lilly of the Valley, &s;oak'd in Vinegar. He, al&s;o, orders us to apply to the Region of the Heart, Epithems prepar'd of Baum, Rue, Mar|joram, Amber, Cinnamon, and Lavender. Thus for In&s;tance;</P>
<P>Take of the be&s;t Ro&s;e-Water an Ounce and an half; of Baum-Water two Ounces and an half; of Ro&s;emary-Water one Ounce; of Malm&s;ey Wine one Ounce and an half; of Lemon Juice one Ounce, of the Powder of Cloves one Scru|ple; of Theriaca one Dram, and of Camphire and Saffron each half a Dram. Mix all together, and in the Liquor &s;oak a Spunge, to be applied to the Region of the Heart.</P>
<P>As the genital Parts of both Sexes have a near and intimate Corre&s;pondence with the Heart, as is obvious from the Effects of Cordials, applied to tho&s;e Parts, in Syncopes, Faintings, and other Affections of the Heart, &s;o <HI>Nymman,</HI> in order to re&s;tore drowned Per&s;ons to Life, orders the&s;e Parts to be fomented with warm Wine, in which Cinna|mon, Cloves, Musk, and Baum have been boiled.</P>
<P>But if any Succe&s;s is to be expected from the&s;e Remedies, it is principally, when by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Frictions, the mo&s;t volatile Parts of Spirituous Liquors are made to penetrate into the Ma&s;s of
<PB N="50" REF="52">Fluids; and it is highly probable, that indepen|dently of the Experience of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> this Me|thod will an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed by <HI>Dethardin|gius,</HI> which is, the procuring of a free Expiration; for, if the Admixture of the &s;pirituous. Parts of cordial Liquors re&s;tores the Cour&s;e of the Spirits and Blood, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that both mu&s;t be more copiou&s;ly conveyed to the Mu&s;cles de&s;tin'd for the Purpo&s;es of Expiration.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o certain, from Experience, that one of the mo&s;t efficacious Expedients for re&s;toring drown'd Per&s;ons to Li&s;e, is &s;peedy Vene&s;ection, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Parts, mo&s;t proper for relieving the Head, as the Ankles, for In&s;tance, and the Jugular Veins. The U&s;e of Vene&s;ection, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently obvious to every one who con&s;iders, that drowned Per&s;ons, as well as tho&s;e who are hang'd, die of an Apoplexy of the &s;anguineous Kind, and not for Want of Re&s;piration, or, as is commonly imagined, on Account of a Repletion, or choaking up of the Brea&s;t by Blood; for when &s;uch Per&s;ons are laid open, the Brea&s;t is found almo&s;t entirely void of Blood, and the Brain extremely inflamed; both which Phoenomena are highly agreeable to the Laws of the Circulation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t common and approved Me|thods of re&s;toring drown'd Per&s;ons to Life; but, if they &s;hould happen to prove ineffectual, the la&s;t Re&s;ource is, what we commonly call <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> or <HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in opening the <HI>Tra|chea,</HI> in order to procure a free Acce&s;s of the Air to the Lungs. This Operation is principally in|tended to remove the ob&s;tinate Adherence of the Epiglottis to the Orifice of the Glottis; in con&s;e|quence of which Circum&s;tance, the Air con|tained in the Lungs is freely di&s;charged. Tra|cheotomy was indeed originally intended for the Extraction of foreign Bodies from the <HI>Trachea,</HI> or
<PB N="51" REF="53">for the procuring an Acce&s;s of the Air to the Lungs when the Inflammation of the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>La|rynx,</HI> is &s;o con&s;iderable in Quin&s;eys, as to clo&s;e up the Aperture of the <HI>Glottis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> according to <HI>Dethardingius,</HI> has all the Advantages which can be wi&s;hed for, &s;ince it affords Relief <HI>&s;peedily, effectually,</HI> and <HI>agreeably: Speedily,</HI> becau&s;e there is no more expeditious Me|thod of procuring a Di&s;charge of the Air, which, by its natural Spring, and by the continual Com|pre&s;&s;ion of the Abdomen, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be eva|cuated in that Manner. Now the Air cannot e&s;cape from the Pulmonary Ve&s;icles, without their collap|&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ing into the Pulmonary Vein, the Blood which had entered the Pulmonary Artery, which cannot happen, without adding a greater Fa|cility of Circulation to the arterial Blood. Now the Blood arriving at the left Auricle, and thence at the left Ventricle, produces a new Contraction of the Heart; upon which the Circulation is re|e&s;tabli&s;hed, and Life di&s;covers it&s;elf by manife&s;t Signs, e&s;pecially by Re&s;piration.</P>
<P><HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> al&s;o, affords Relief without Dan|ger, becau&s;e we are no longer afraid of making an Inci&s;ion in tho&s;e Cartilages, which the Ancients, in Con&s;equence of their bony Nature, imagined inca|pable of Con&s;olidation. We no longer dread the Hemorrhage, &s;ince only a few Drops of Blood are di&s;charged in opening the Membrane, which unites the Ringlets of the <HI>Arteria Trachea;</HI> and &s;ince there are not contiguous to the Part, &s;uch large Blood Ve&s;&s;els, as being wounded would produce terrible Effects. There is no Danger of injuring the Voice by means of this Operation, &s;ince the Operator cannot hurt the Mu&s;cles of the Larynx; and &s;ince there are no Nerves, the Dilaceration of which &s;hould impair or de&s;troy the Sen&s;ation of the Part.
<PB N="52" REF="54">In a Word, it is no difficult Task to heal up, and con&s;olidate the Wound, for this is readily effected by means of a Plai&s;ter, or &s;ome bal&s;amic Ointment.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Tracheotomy</HI> affords Relief <HI>agreeably,</HI> for it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be painful to a drowned Per&s;on, who&s;e Sen&s;es are &s;o locked up, as to render him incapable of feeling Pain. Thus the Operation is performed, without being intercepted by the Cries, the Groans, and Motions, which Pain would pro|duce.</P>
<P><HI>Paulus Aegincta</HI> is the fir&s;t Author extant, who de&s;crib'd the Operation of <HI>Broncotomy,</HI> from <HI>Antyl|lus.</HI> But the judicious and accurate <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> in his Surgery, de&s;cribes this Operation very di&s;tinctly. The Words <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Laryngotomy,</HI> and <HI>Tracheotomy,</HI> are convertible Terms, and mean no more than an Inci&s;ion of the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> or what we commonly call the <HI>Wind-Pipe:</HI> and indeed va|rious Cau&s;es and Circum&s;tances concur, to render this Operation ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary on &s;ome Oc|ca&s;ions; for, in the fir&s;t Place, it becomes princi|pally and indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;o, when in a Quin&s;ey, the Fauces are &s;o terribly inflamed, that the Patient is in imminent Danger of having his Re&s;piration quite &s;topt, and a total Suffocation brought on. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It becomes nece&s;&s;ary, when a Bean, a Prune, a Cherry-&s;tone, a Pea, or any other extraneous Sub|&s;tance falls into the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> and &s;eems to threaten a Suffocation. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>A&s;pera Arte|ria</HI> is al&s;o to be opened, in &s;uch Per&s;ons, as have been &s;uffocated, in Con&s;equence of their being im|mers'd in Water, or as we commonly expre&s;s it, in newly drowned People; for Re&s;piration has been often re&s;tored to Per&s;ons in this Condition, by open|ing the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> and by that means procu|ring a free Acce&s;s of the Air to the Lungs. I am &s;ufficiently appriz'd, that a great many forbid ma|king
<PB N="53" REF="55">an Inci&s;ion in the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> and con&s;e|quently condemn this Operation; becau&s;e they think it productive of Death, and are therefore prompted by an idle Zeal, to brand the Phy&s;icians, who approve an Operation, &s;o dangerous in their Eyes, with the odious Appellations of barbarous and inhuman. But the Gentlemen, who are of this narrow and confined Way of Thinking, are gro&s;sly mi&s;taken; for in this Operation, the &s;mall Inci&s;ion made in the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> is &s;o far from killing the Patient, that it does not produce that Effect when made con&s;iderably large; and <HI>Garen|geot</HI> gives Examples of various Cures performed by this Operation; &s;o that we think our&s;elves autho|riz'd with <HI>Ca&s;&s;erius, in Tr. de Vocis, Auditu&s;&abque; Orga|nis,</HI> to pronounce tho&s;e Men unskilful, timorous, and even cruel, who in the Ca&s;es now mentioned, fooli&s;hly neglecting this Operation, which is not only &s;afe, but al&s;o attended with the mo&s;t &s;peedy and &s;alutary Effects, &s;uffer the Patients to die for Want of this &s;ea&s;onable A&s;&s;i&s;tance. In&s;tances of this Nature may be &s;een in <HI>Nicolai Fontani Ob&s;ervat. Rarior. Analect.</HI> and in <HI>Ca&s;&s;erius.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Bronchotomy</HI> is to be perform'd, that Part of the <HI>Trachea</HI> &s;eems mo&s;t proper for making the Aperture in, which is &s;ituated between its &s;econd and third cartilaginous <HI>Annuli,</HI> or Ringlets. The Inci&s;ion, may, however, be made a little lower, without any Danger. The Method of performing the Operation, e&s;pecially when a foreign Sub&s;tance falling into the A&s;pera Arteria, and threatning a Suf|focation is to be extracted, is thus. The Patient is fir&s;t of all to be &s;ituated in a reclining Po&s;ture, either in Bed, or in &s;ome convenient Chair, and his Head is to be held firm by an A&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;tanding behind his Back. Then a longitudinal Inci&s;ion is to be made, thro' the Skin, Fat, and Mu&s;cles,
<PB N="54" REF="56">from about two Fingers Breadth below the <HI>Carti|lago Thyroides,</HI> or Seutiformis, or the <HI>Pomum Ada|mi,</HI> in the middle of the <HI>Trachea,</HI> down to the very Sternum, &s;o that the Length of the Inci&s;ion may be two, three, and in tall Patients, four Fin|gers Breadth in Length.</P>
<P>Then an A&s;&s;i&s;tant is carefally to draw the Lips of this Orifice from each other, either with proper Hooks, or with his Fingers; and having ab&s;orb'd and wip'd away the Blood, either by a Spunge or Linnen Cloth, &s;o that the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria</HI> may be &s;een, three or four of the Annuli or Ringlets of that &s;piral Pipe, are to be cut in &s;uch a Manner, that the Inci&s;ions made in the Whole, may form one continued Line, and thus whatever Sub&s;tance may have &s;lipt into it, is to be artfully and cauti|ou&s;ly extracted, either by a Probe, Hook, or For|ceps. This being done, the Wound is to be cleans'd, with a Spunge, and its Lips being kept in Contact by adhe&s;ive Plai&s;ters, a proper Compre&s;s and Ban|dage are to be applied. It is afterwards to be care|fully agglutinated, by means of vulnerary Bal&s;ams, as in other Wounds of the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria.</HI> By this very Method, continues <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> I my&s;elf in <HI>Helm|&s;tadt,</HI> happily extracted a Piece of boil'd Mu&s;h|room from a Patient, who happening to laugh while he was &s;upping Broth, in which among other Things there were Mu&s;hrooms, had the Misfor|tune to have a Piece of one of them &s;lip into his <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> by which means he was in Danger of being &s;uffocated. <HI>Ravius,</HI> continues <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> al&s;o inform'd me, that by this very Method, he happily extracted a Bean from the Throat of a Pa|tient. Some in order to induce a more &s;peedy and &s;eemly Cicatrix on the Wound recommend Con|glutination by Suture as in the Hare Lip. But 'tis certainly ab&s;urd to follow a Practice attended
<PB N="55" REF="57">with &s;o much Pain to the Patient, whil&s;t Methods equally good, and at the &s;ame Time far milder may be pur&s;u'd.</P>
<P>But in all Ca&s;es where a Suffocation is either dreaded, or actually pre&s;ent, <HI>Tracheotomy</HI> is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, and may be perform'd in three different Manners. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e the Patient is to be plac'd in a Bed or Chair, with his Head reclin'd at the Operator's Di&s;cretion, and held firm by an A&s;&s;i&s;tant, as before directed. Then let the Surgeon make an Inci&s;ion in that middle Part of the Throat, and in the &s;ame Manner as before or|der'd, till he reaches the <HI>Trachea</HI> it&s;elf, if he thinks proper; the Skin on both Sides is to be laid hold of by the A&s;&s;i&s;tant; then it may be rais'd and cut longitudinally. After the&s;e Mea&s;ures are taken, the Fat and Mu&s;cles lying above the <HI>Trachea</HI> are to be cut. Some would have the&s;e Mu&s;cles fir&s;t di&s;en|gag'd from the <HI>Trachea,</HI> or cautiou&s;ly &s;eparated from the others; but there is no Occa&s;ion for all this Labour, &s;ince they may be cut &s;afely and with|out any Danger. Then the Operator is to clean&s;e the Wound with a Spunge wrung out of warm Wine, or warm Spirit of Wine for &s;topping the Blood more effectually. The A&s;&s;i&s;tant is, in the mean Time to &s;eparate and retract the Lips, either by Hooks, or by his Fingers. Then the Surgeon is to pa&s;s his Knife between two of the Annuli of <HI>Trachea,</HI> or he may even pa&s;s it in &s;uch a Manner as to cut one of them, &s;ince by that means a &s;ilver or leaden Pipe either round or flat, furni&s;h'd with <HI>An&s;ae,</HI> or a Rim, &s;o as to prevent its falling into the <HI>Trachea,</HI> may be conveniently in&s;erted into the Wound. But before the Surgeon withdraws his Knife, &s;ome proper Probe ought to be in&s;erted in the Wound, by the Side of the Knife, that by its A&s;&s;i&s;tance a Pipe may be more commodiou&s;ly and
<PB N="56" REF="58">put into it. This Pipe is fix'd in the Wound by means of a Ligature pa&s;s'd thro' its Annuli or &s;mall Holes in the Rim, and carried round the Neck, as al&s;o by means of a perforated adhe&s;ive Plai&s;ter: But great Care is to be taken that the End of the Pipe which is in&s;erted into the Wound be not per|mitted to touch the po&s;terior Part of the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria</HI> le&s;t by this means a trouble&s;ome Cough &s;hould be excited. But that the Lungs may not be injur'd by external Cold, or any Filth falling upon them, it is highly proper, to lay upon the Pipe, a Spunge, often impregnated with warm Wine, and again wrung out; or as <HI>Garengeot</HI> advi&s;es, a thin Linnen Cloth, and afterwards a perforated Plai&s;ter. The&s;e Directions being duly ob&s;erv'd, Blood is to be taken either from the Veins of the Neck or Feet, tho&s;e under the Tongue, or tho&s;e &s;i|tuated in the Neck. When Re&s;piration is totally re&s;tor'd, which is mo&s;t quickly di&s;cover'd by &s;top|ping up the Pipe with one Finger, the Pipe is to be taken out, and the Wound agglutinated in the Manner above directed. But when the Difficulty of Breathing at the Mouth is con&s;iderable, the Pipe is to be left for &s;ome Time longer in the Wound, and the other Medicines continued.</P>
<P>Another and more expeditious Method of open|ing the <HI>Trachea,</HI> is this, a two edged Knife is ap|plied to the abovemention'd Part of the Throat, and cautiou&s;ly pa&s;s'd thro' the Skin, Fat, and Mu&s;cles, into the Cavity of the <HI>Trachea</HI> it&s;elf, and a Pipe is forthwith in&s;erted into the Wound, and carefully &s;ecur'd in the Manner before directed. This Manner of Operation is not only quicker, but al&s;o produces a &s;maller Cicatrix than the former.</P>
<P>The third and la&s;t Method of performing this Operation is, with an In&s;trument call'd a <HI>Trocar,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="59">in tapping for the Drop&s;y, which no Surgeon ought to be without. This In&s;trument applied to the Middle of the <HI>Trachea,</HI> may, as it were, at one Thru&s;t be pa&s;s'd thro' the Skin, Fat, and Mu&s;cles, into its very Cavity. Then taking out the perforating Part, let the Pipe remain in the Orifice till the Pa|tient recovers. This Method of Operation, &s;eems in one Re&s;pect, to have the Advantage of all the re&s;t, which is, that it is &s;oon over, and the Pipe at the &s;ame Time introduc'd into the Wound with far le&s;s Pain to the Patient, than by any other Me|thod: But even in this Ca&s;e the &s;ame Caution ought to be us'd, and the &s;ame Directions follow'd, which we have above &s;pecified.</P>
<P>If Per&s;ons drown'd, continues <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> are but ju&s;t dead, their <HI>A&s;pera Arteria</HI> is to be open'd with all Expedition, either with an Inci&s;ion-knife, or any other In&s;trument the Surgeon &s;hall judge pro|per. Then it is expedient &s;trongly to blow into the Orifice, either with the naked Mouth, or by Means of a common Pipe, the Shank of which is to be introduc'd into the Wound, whil&s;t the A&s;|&s;i&s;tant blows into the Bole. The learned <HI>Dethar|dingius,</HI> in a Di&s;&s;ertation on this very Subject, in|forms us, that by this Method, if &s;peedily put in Execution, Life returns to the &s;uffocated Patients, with the injected Air, and that he is in a Manner miraculou&s;ly rais'd from the Dead. For this Rea|&s;on the Operation &s;hould in &s;uch Ca&s;es be perform'd with the greate&s;t Ha&s;te and Expedition imagi|nable.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> our Countryman, in his Surgery, a&s;|&s;ures us that this Operation is ab&s;olutely void of all Danger, and de&s;cribes it in the following Manner.</P>
<P>Bronchotomy is perform'd, by making a longi|tudinal Inci&s;ion thro' the Skin, three Quarters of an Inch long, between the third and fourth Ring|lets
<PB N="58" REF="60">of the <HI>Trachea,</HI> when the Operator has his own Choice of the Place; it is always advis'd to pinch up the Skin in this Operation, which how|ever may be left to the Di&s;cretion of the Surgeon, who when the Skin is cut thro', mu&s;t make a &s;mall tran&s;ver&s;e Inci&s;ion into the Wind Pipe, and imme|diately introduce a crooked <HI>Canula,</HI> near half an Inch long, of Silver or Lead, with a Couple of little Rings at the Top of it, thro' which a Rib|band may be pa&s;s'd round the Neck, to keep it fix'd in the Wound.</P>
<P>Some have pre&s;crib'd making an Inci&s;ion thro' the Skin and Trachea at once, with a Lancet or Knife as the more ea&s;y and expeditious Manner, and &s;ays the Author, I once &s;aw it perform'd in this Way, but it prov'd very inconvenient; for the Wind-pipe, in Re&s;piration moving up and down, &s;lipp'd from the Orifice of the Skin, and made it very difficult to introduce the Canula, and afterwards maintain it in its Situation. Wherefore I think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make an external Inci&s;ion longitudinal, and even pretty large, as I have directed above.</P>
<P>The Caution of rai&s;ing the Sternohyoidei and Sternothyroidei Mu&s;cles before opening the Wind-pipe is not to be regarded; and as to the Divi&s;ion of the recurrent Nerves, and large Blood Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o much dreaded in this Operation 'tis not in the lea&s;t to be fear'd, &s;ince they are quite out of the Reach of the In&s;trument, as any Per&s;on &s;kill'd in the Anatomy of the&s;e Parts, mu&s;t very well know.</P>
<P>The Method of dre&s;&s;ing is ea&s;ily under&s;tood; &s;ince after the Patient can breath by the natural Pa&s;&s;age, if we withdraw the Pipe, the Wound becomes a &s;imple one, and notwith&s;tanding its Pe|netration thro' a Cartilage, into a large Cavity, re|quires only a &s;uperficial Application.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="61">
<P>Upon the Whole it appears beyond all Contra|diction, that <HI>Bronchotomy</HI> is a &s;afe Operation, and has been &s;o often perform'd with Succe&s;s, that no Surgeon has any Rea&s;on to he&s;itate in performing it, in Ca&s;es where particular Circum&s;tances indi|cate its Propriety. For this Rea&s;on 'tis &s;ufficiently obvious, that this Operation ought with all Expe|dition to be perform'd on drown'd Per&s;ons, many of whom have been happily re&s;tor'd to Life by this very Means. It is carefully to be ob&s;erv'd, that this Expedient, is far more efficacious than blowing into a Per&s;on's Mouth, as is confirm'd by the fol|lowing Experiment made by <HI>Becker.</HI> This Phy|&s;ician hang'd a Dog, till no more Motion of his Heart was perceiv'd, and having left him dead on the Ground for half a Quarter of an Hour, he to no Purpo&s;e blow'd Air into his Throat. Then he perform'd the Operation of <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> and hav|ing thrice blown the Air into his Lungs, the Brea&s;t of the Dog began to elevate it&s;elf, and at the fifth Bla&s;t, he mov'd his Feet. After this he was blood|ed in the Throat to give Vent to the Blood, and at la&s;t gave &s;ome howling Barks, but &s;urviv'd the Ac|cident for &s;everal Years. Now as the Cau&s;e of Death is the &s;ame in drown'd as in hang'd Ani|mals, why &s;hould not the &s;ame Means re&s;tore them both to Life.</P>
<P>I have been very particular with re&s;pect to the Operation of <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> becau&s;e it is of great Importance, and of &s;ingular U&s;e in more Ca&s;es than one; and that no one might be ignorant of the Me|thods of performing it. In the Ca&s;e before us, that of drown'd Per&s;ons, it may frequently be nece&s;&s;ary where no Surgeon is to be procur'd &s;oon enough to retrieve the Misfortune and pre&s;erve Life. In this Situation, as there is no great Danger of injuring a Per&s;on, who appears to be dead, and mu&s;t be
<PB N="60" REF="62">ab&s;olutely &s;o without immediate Relief, any com|mon Per&s;on, tho not bred a Surgeon, may by the&s;e Directions, be enabled to perform the Ope|ration, by making a Perforation in the Place above directed, with any Sharp pointed Knife. Then in|&s;tead of a Canula or Tube of Metal, if that is not at hand, a Tobacco Pipe may be broken about three Quarters of an Inch, or an Inch, from the Bole, and the Part contiguous to the Bole may be introduc'd into the Perforation, taking Care not to break it within the <HI>Trachea;</HI> and then by blowing into the Bole, the Lungs may be inflated.</P>
<P>After having thus collected every Thing of any Importance upon the pre&s;ent Subject, we mu&s;t beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that, tho' with Re&s;pect to Mat|ters of Religion and Con&s;cience, it is not only ex|tremely ab&s;urd, but al&s;o highly cruel and barbarous to invoke the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Interpo&s;ition of the &s;ecular Power. Yet in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, &s;uch an Attempt is &s;o far from being either ab&s;urd or bar|barous, that it be&s;peaks Compa&s;&s;ion and Huma|nity; for we may &s;afely appeal to Experience how many worthy Members of Society, generous Friends, affectionate Hu&s;bands, tender Parents, and dutiful Children, have in foreign Countries been re&s;tor'd to Life by the&s;e very Means; where|as in <HI>England,</HI> Per&s;ons of equal Worth, have for Want of proper Care, been laid in their Graves, at a Time when they might, for many future Years have prov'd the common Ble&s;&s;ings of the various Communities of which they were Members.</P>
<P>This melancholy and deplorable Con&s;ideration, will &s;ufficiently authori&s;e me to propo&s;e a Regula|tion to the Legi&s;lature of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e princi|pal Aim &s;eems ultimately to terminate in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive Happine&s;s of the Subject. It
<PB N="61" REF="63">is, that this Treatment of Per&s;ons &s;upposd to be drown'd, may be enforc'd by all the Authority of the Law; and that no one may be &s;uffer'd to be buried without it; and this under &s;evere Penal|ties; for otherwi&s;e I am afraid the&s;e Endeavours of mine, however well intended, will not have the de&s;ir'd Effect, nor be attended, to &s;o much as the Subject de&s;erves.</P>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX. Concerning the Methods of re&s;toring hang'd Per&s;ons to Life, and Children &s;up|pos'd to be born dead.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>England</HI> is above all other Nations in the World, ju&s;tly branded with <HI>Suicide,</HI> com|monly known by the Name of Self-murder, and as our Countrymen frequently make Choice of a Rope for that Purpo&s;e, we &s;hall briefly point out the Methods of re&s;toring hang'd Per&s;ons to Life.</P>
<P>'Tis certain then, that hang'd Per&s;ons die of an A|poplexy of the &s;anguineous Kind, produc'd by an Ob|&s;truction of the Blood, by the Rope, in the jugu|lar Veins, whil&s;t the Arteries being freer from this Compre&s;&s;ion, continue to convey the Blood to the Brain. We may form a Judgment of the Effects produc'd by a Compre&s;&s;ion of the jugular Veins, from the following Pa&s;&s;age of <Q><BIBL><HI>Alexander Benedictus</HI> in <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 33.</BIBL> "When, &s;ays that judicious Author, a Redundance of Blood ob&s;tructs the

The <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> &s;ometimes put &s;ound Per&s;ons into a &s;imilar State, when for In&s;tance they intended to circumci&s;e Adults or Children. Thus having laid them on their Backs in a Bath, they com|pre&s;s'd their jugular Veins, &s;o as &s;peedily to pro|duce a Privation both of Motion and Sen&s;ation; and taking the Advantage of this Circum&s;tance, cut off the Prepuce with as much Ea&s;e as if the Patient was in an Apoplexy.

<P><HI>Nymman,</HI> al&s;o, in <HI>Tr. de Apoplexia, cap.</HI> 14. de|clares his Sentiments on this Subject in the follow|ing Manner. <Q>"The Functions of the Brain, &s;ays he, are de&s;troy'd without any Le&s;ion of the a|nimal Spirits and Nerves, as appears in a Syn|cope. The like happens to hang'd Per&s;ons, who are no &s;ooner hung up, provided an expert Executioner exactly brace up the Ve&s;&s;els of the Neck, with the Rope, than they become immove|able as a Log of Wood, without even &s;o much as moving their Feet, notwith&s;tanding which Phae|nomena, the Brain and Origin of the Nerves &s;uf|fer nothing in &s;uch Per&s;ons; &s;ince tho&s;e Parts are defended by the Cranium and Vertebrae, which can never be injur'd by the Rope. Nor is the Interception of Re&s;piration to be accus'd as the Cau&s;e of Death in hang'd Per&s;ons, &s;ince tho we clo&s;ely &s;hut up the Mouth and No&s;trils of an Animal &s;o as to hinder the Acce&s;s of Air into the Brea&s;t, yet as the Brain &s;till retains its vital Spirit, it powerfully oppo&s;es the imminent Dan|ger of a Suffocation, by a violent Agitation of
<PB N="63" REF="65">the Body, and an exce&s;&s;ive Motion of the Feet, which Circum&s;tances are never ob&s;erv'd in hang'd Per&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e Authorities we evidently &s;ee the &s;peedy Effects produc'd by the Compre&s;&s;ion of the jugular Veins. This Doctrine is farther illu&s;trated by <Q><BIBL><HI>Bartholine</HI> in <HI>Cent,</HI> 1. <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 32,</BIBL> "In di&s;&s;ecting, &s;ays this Author, a Man of a tall Stature, of a &s;anguine Temperament, and vigorous Con&s;titu|tion, who was hang'd for a Robbery, I found his Lungs preternaturally large, blewi&s;h, &s;treak'd with different Colours, light and &s;pungious, and &s;o full of a frothy Blood, that every where on the Membrane which covers them, the Veins not only appear'd turgid, but the Lobes were al&s;o &s;o large as to embarra&s;s me in di&s;&s;ecting the Heart. The Ventricules of the Brain were full of Water, as al&s;o the Origin of the Nerves which enter the Spine. The <HI>Plexus Choroides,</HI> al&s;o, be&s;ides the Inflation of its Ve&s;&s;els, con|tain'd a great many Ve&s;icules."</Q></P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of Knowledge in hang'd Per&s;ons, al&s;o, proves the Truth of this Doctrine, and this Lo&s;s is &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted by <HI>Camerarius</HI> in <HI>Cent.</HI> 7. <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 40. where we are told, that a Robber being hangd and falling into the Hands of the Surgeons for Di&s;&s;ection, was neverthele&s;s re&s;tor'd to Life, not|with&s;tanding his Mouth was full of Froth, which is generally look'd upon as an infallible Sign of irri|trievable Death, e&s;pecially where it continues long, as it did in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and notwith&s;tanding he had before his Execution been &s;eiz'd with a Fit of Madne&s;s. When this Man, however, was re|&s;tor'd to Life, he &s;aid he rememberd nothing of what had pa&s;s'd on that Occa&s;ion, except that he was conducted to the criminal Chamber, after which he was in&s;en&s;ible of every Thing. This
<PB N="64" REF="66">Robber was hang'd a &s;econd Time for committing fre&s;h Robberies, a convincing Proof, that he did not look upon the fir&s;t as a formidable Puni&s;h|ment. <HI>Camerarius</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 38. mentions another, who was twice hang'd; and in <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 39. another who was re&s;tor'd to Life by the Phy&s;icians of <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> after he had been hang'd.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of Life and Death, relates an Accident, which like that of <HI>Camerarius,</HI> proves the Lo&s;s of Knowledge in hang'd Per&s;ons. A young Gentleman of &s;ome Di&s;tinction, curious to know the Pain &s;uffer'd by hang'd Per&s;ons, having fix'd a Rope about his Neck, threw him|&s;elf from a low Stool upon which he imagin'd he could ea&s;ily put his Feet again: But his Attempts of this Kind were in vain, and he had been irre|trievably &s;uffocated, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Friend who had the Curio&s;ity to be pre&s;ent at &s;uch an unaccountable Experiment. Upon his Reco|very, his Friend a&s;king him if he had felt any Pain; he an&s;wer'd that he had perceiv'd none in any Part of his Body; but added, that at fir&s;t he ob&s;erv'd before his Eyes, a Species of Fire or blaz|ing Light; then an extreme Darkne&s;s, and la&s;t of all a pale Blue, or a Sea-green, like that which frequently pre&s;ents it&s;elf before the Eyes of tho&s;e who fall into Deliquiums. Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> &s;ubjoins, that he heard a Phy&s;ician of Candour and Worth, a&s;&s;ert, that he had re&s;tor'd Life to a Man who had been hang'd half an Hour, affirming at the &s;ame Time, that by proper Means the &s;ame Effect might be produc'd upon others, who had hung no longer, provided the Effort of their fir&s;t Fall had not lux|ated the Vertebrae of their Necks.</P>
<P>After having thus di&s;cover'd the Cau&s;e of Death in hang'd Per&s;ons, we are the better able to form
<PB N="65" REF="67">an E&s;timate of the Means mo&s;t proper to re&s;tore them to Life.</P>
<P>Frictions then, and hot Baths, by re&s;toring the Motion of the Blood, and re&s;olving its Coagula|tion, mu&s;t for the&s;e very Rea&s;ons produce happy Effects on hang'd Per&s;ons. <HI>Pechlinus</HI> in <HI>Tr. de Aer. &amp; Aliment. Defect. cap.</HI> 7. relates an Ob&s;erva|tion, which &s;ufficiently evinces the Efficacy of Sal Ammoniac on &s;imilar Occa&s;ions. <Q>"I knew, &s;ays he, a Woman hang'd, who after &s;he had re|main'd for &s;ome Time without Pul&s;e and Re&s;pi|ration, with her Lips cover'd with Froth, which is look'd upon as an infallible Sign of the total Pri|vation of Life, and in a Word, after &s;he appear'd to be the nece&s;&s;ary Victim of Death, was yet re|&s;tor'd to Life, by a Phy&s;ician who coming acci|dentally to the Place where &s;he lay, made her &s;wal|low a con&s;iderable Quantity of the Spirit of Sal Ammoniac."</Q> As the Activity of this acrid vola|tile Liquor, and its Propriety to re&s;olve coagulated Blood are &s;ufficiently known; it is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing, that it &s;hould on &s;imilar Occa&s;ions pro|duce &s;uch happy Effects. <Q>"<HI>Pechlinus</HI> &s;ubjoins, I don't in the lea&s;t doubt, but if proper Mea&s;ures were taken in due Time, a great many hang'd Per&s;ons might be re&s;tor'd to Life, even after tho&s;e who have an Opportunity of &s;eeing them, think they have all the Rea&s;on in the World, to conclude them really and irretrievably dead. This Effect is mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly produc'd by re&s;toring the Circulation of their Blood, by means of Frictions, Vene&s;ections, and the Ex|hibition of hot and &s;pirituous Remedies, or of &s;ome other analogous Sub&s;tances."</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;ufficiently ea&s;y from what we have before &s;aid, to conceive, how Vene&s;ection is excellently calculated for re&s;toring Life to hang'd Per&s;ons,
<PB N="66" REF="68">and as for &s;pirituous Liquors, they act at once on the Blood and Ve&s;&s;els, By attenuating the former, and re&s;toring the proper Spring and Tone of the latter. The Remedies of this Kind are before &s;pecify'd.</P>
<P><HI>Schenkius</HI> in <HI>Ob&s;ervat. Art. de Suffocat. ex Laquea,</HI> orders that drown'd Per&s;ons &s;hould be made to &s;wallow Vinegar and Pepper; or Oxymel mix'd with the Powder of Penny-royal. He, al&s;o, advi&s;es to excite a Vomiting by means of a Feather dipt in Oil, and to wrap up the Patient's Neck in a Woollen Cloth dipt in warm Oil, e&s;pecially the Oil of Orris.</P>
<P>The Virtues of Oxymel, or of &s;imple Vinegar with Pepper, are &s;ufficiently evinc'd by <HI>Chri&s;to|phorus de Vega Art. Med. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. All Phy&s;icians are &s;ufficiently appriz'd, that Vine|gar moderately us'd, is a powerful Re&s;olvent, whil&s;t Pepper is an acrid Sub&s;tance, equally pro|per to di&s;&s;olve the Coagulations of the Juices, and reanimate the Fibres, by the Irritation it produces in them. The Powder of Penny-royal is, al&s;o, an acrid Aromatic, who&s;e Effect mu&s;t of cour&s;e be nearly the &s;ame with that of Pepper.</P>
<P>As for exciting a Vomiting in hang'd Per&s;ons, I think it more dangerous than in tho&s;e who are drown|ed; for the Contractions of the Mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to Expiration, may &s;erve to re&s;tore that Function as we have already ob&s;erv'd, &s;ince the Inflation of the Abdomen and Brea&s;t of hang'd Per&s;ons, is a Proof that their In&s;piration is forc'd and unnatural, yet in &s;uch Circum&s;tances it &s;eems dangerous to con|vey a greater Quantity of Blood to the Head which is before overchargd with it, as is &s;ufficient|ly obvious, not only from the preceding Hi&s;tories, but al&s;o from the livid Colour of the Countenance. It is, however, certain, that the Shocks given to the Parts by means of the Vomiting, are very
<PB N="67" REF="69">proper to di&s;&s;olve the Coagulations of the Blood, though I would never advi&s;e the U&s;e of this Me|thod, till after a previous Venefection.</P>
<P>The Topic mentioned above, which <HI>Schenkius</HI> orders to be applied to the Neck, may produce very happy Effects, by re&s;olving the Blood col|lected in the Skin and Mu&s;cles of the Neck, and relaxing the Parts which had &s;uffered mo&s;t imme|diately by the Rope.</P>
<P><HI>Ge&s;ner,</HI> for a Girl who hang'd her&s;elf, &s;ucce&s;s|fully ordered Powder of Ca&s;tor, which he forc'd down in warm Broth. This Remedy is al&s;o of a volatile and re&s;olvent Nature. <HI>Joubert. in Lib.</HI> 4, <HI>it Effect. Thor. Cap.</HI> 1. informs us, that he re|&s;tored many hang'd Per&s;ons to Life, without &s;uch a Multiplicity of Expedients; &s;ince he u&s;ed no other Method than Vene&s;ection, and forcing into their Stomachs a due Quantity of good Wine.</P>
<P><HI>Ranchinus in Tr. de Morb. &s;ubit. Cap.</HI> 12. orders Oil of Orris, or of Lillies, to be applied to the Necks of hang'd Per&s;ons, whil&s;t their Mouths are to be gargariz'd with Syrup of Violets, di&s;&s;ol|ved in warm Water, or Barley-water. He al&s;o pre&s;cribes Vomiting, excited by a Feather, in order to enlarge the Pa&s;&s;ages more. The &s;ame Author al&s;o recommends Pepper and Penny-royal, either in Vinegar, Oxymel, Wine, or the <HI>Aqua Caele&s;tis.</HI> But Vene&s;ection is the Expedient on which he depends mo&s;t for happy Effects. The Oils and the Syrup are only intended to procure a Relaxa|tion; and as for the Gargari&s;m, it cannot be usd till the hang'd Per&s;on is previou&s;ly re&s;tored to Life. The Pepper, Penny-royal, and other Sub&s;tances mentioned by him, are de&s;ign'd to re-animate and re&s;tore the natural Heat.</P>
<P><HI>Aelius in Tetrabibl. Serm.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap.</HI> 49. orders us to add to the Pepper and Vinegar, Nettle-&s;eeds, which are al&s;o of an highly acrid Nature. The &s;ame
<PB N="68" REF="70">Author affirms, that when the Redne&s;s round the Neck of hang'd Per&s;ons is di&s;&s;ipated, they open their Eyes, and the Parts are relaxed. He is al&s;o of Opinion, that we ought not to &s;pare Fomenta|tions of the Neck, with warm Oils, Cerate, or Woollen Cloths.</P>
<P><HI>Ranchinus,</HI> from other Authors, greatly extols a Remedy which mo&s;t People will think as &s;ingular in it&s;elf as di&s;agreeable to the Per&s;on who admini&s;ters it. It con&s;i&s;ts of blowing into the Mouth of hang'd Per&s;ons, provided the Admini&s;trator has in his own Mouth, a bruis'd Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, or Carraway-&s;eeds. As it is certain, that the&s;e Aro|matics produce no other Effect, than impregnating the Air with &s;ome volatile Parts, proper to re&s;tore the Motion of the Fluids, &s;o 'tis equally certain, that the principal Efficacy of this Practice depends upon the <HI>Blowing,</HI> which in this Ca&s;e mu&s;t infallibly produce Salutary Effects; as is obvious from the following Experiments, recorded in N^o. 28. of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of the Royal &s;ociety of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t then,</HI> Doctor <HI>Croon,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of <HI>Gre&s;ham-College,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the Royal Society, &s;trangled a Pullet, in &s;uch a Manner, as that it di&s;|covered no more Signs of Life; but by afterwards blowing into the <HI>Arteria Trachea,</HI> he &s;o effectually re&s;tored the Motion of the Lungs, that the Pullet returned to Life.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Doctor <HI>Walter Needham,</HI> in the Pre|&s;ence of Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> and other <HI>Literati,</HI> hang'd a Dog, till the Motion of his Heart was no longer to be perceived, after which he open'd the Abdo|men of the Dog, and blowing into the Thoracic Duct, re&s;tored the Motion of the Blood, upon which the Heart began to beat, and the Dog re|turned to Life.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="71">
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Doctor <HI>Hook,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the Royal Society, cut the Ribs, the Diaphragm, and Pericardium of a Dog, after which, making an Inci&s;ion in the &s;uperior Part of the Trachea, he in|troduced into it the Pipe of a Pair of Bellows; then he blow'd the Air into the Lungs, and the Dog returned to Life; but died when he cea&s;ed to blow: By which Expedient he made him live and die alternately, as long as the Company pleas'd.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> Experiment is that of <HI>Becker,</HI> by which he re&s;tored a hang'd Dog to Life, by opening his Larynx, and blowing the Air into his Lungs, through the Inci&s;ion made; &s;o that the Practice en|joined by <HI>Ranchinus,</HI> is by no Means to be neg|lected.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the fir&s;t and fourth Experi|ments are ab&s;olutely the &s;ame with the Practice re|commended by that Author. Now, Why may not that which has &s;ucceeded twice, &s;ucceed of|tener? Though the other Experiments doe not &s;o directly prove the &s;ame Truth, yet it may be ea|&s;ily deduc'd from them; for from the &s;econd it fol|lows, that the Air is not only nece&s;&s;ary to the Cir|culation, becau&s;e by dilating the Lungs it gives a free Pa&s;&s;age to the Blood, from one Ventricle of the Heart to the other, but al&s;o is requi&s;ite to keep the Blood in &s;uch a State of Solution, as Circula|tion requires. Now, by blowing Air into the Lungs, we inflate their Ve&s;icles, which is the fir&s;t Advan|tage produced by Re&s;piration; and the Air by this Means in&s;inuating it&s;elf into the Blood, re|&s;olves its Coagulation. By means of this Expli|cation, 'tis ea&s;y to comprehend how Doctor <HI>Hook</HI>'s Experiment favours the Doctrine of <HI>Ranchinus.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, we may therefore con|clude, Fir&s;t, that blowing in the Mouths of hang'd Per&s;ons is a proper Method of re&s;toring them to
<PB N="70" REF="72">Life; Secondly, That if this Method does not &s;ucceed, we are to perform the Operation of <HI>Bron|chotomy,</HI> and by that Means blow Air into their Lungs: <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That we ought not to be di&s;cou|raged at &s;ome fruitle&s;s Attempts, becau&s;e a Prac|tice, which with <HI>Becker,</HI> did not &s;ucceed till the fifth Time, may perhaps, in other Circum&s;tances, not &s;ucceed till later: Fourthly, That we mu&s;t not at the &s;ame Time, neglect the&s;e other Means, which have a Tendency to re&s;tore the lo&s;t Fluidity of the Blood: Fifthly, That if Death does not &s;uc|ceed Strangulation, this is rather the Effect of the Stiffne&s;s of the Cartilages which compo&s;e the La|rynx, or according to &s;ome, of the Slackne&s;s of the Rope, than of the ea&s;y Di&s;po&s;ition of the Blood to re&s;ume its Fluidity: Sixthly, That it is highly probable, that an efficacious Method of re|&s;toring drown'd Per&s;ons to Life, would be, to in|ject Air into the Blood, by introducing a &s;mall Pipe into &s;ome of the larger Veins, for that Purpo&s;e; For what Difference is there between making the Air enter the Blood by the Thoracic Duct, or by any other Part. The only Caution which I think ought to be given, is, to make choice of tho&s;e Veins mo&s;t contiguous to the Heart; &s;o that for this very Rea&s;on, as well as for their Largene&s;s, and the Facility of finding them, I judge the ex|ternal Jugulars mo&s;t proper for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having already ob&s;erved, that as the Cau&s;e of Death is the &s;ame in hang'd and drown'd Per&s;ons, &s;o the Mea&s;ures taken for the Relief of the one, may be al&s;o u&s;ed for re&s;toring the Lives of the others, We proceed to give &s;ome Hi&s;tories of Facts, which prove the Po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;toring &s;uffocated People to Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Falconet</HI> then, a Gentleman of &s;trict Probity and Candour, told Dr. <HI>Bruhier,</HI> That his Father
<PB N="71" REF="73">had a fool-hardy Coachman, who falling into a Quarrel at <HI>Lyons,</HI> killed a Man, and being appre|hended on the Spot, was forthwith condemn'd to be hang'd, which Sentence was accordingly put in Execution. The Surgeons of the Town having ob|tained his Body, in order to make a Skeleton, brought it into a Surgery, where they left it upon a Table; but when they came next Day to di&s;&s;ect it, they were &s;urprized to find the Man not only alive, but in good Health, and pi&s;&s;ing in the Chim|ney, for want, as he &s;aid, of a Chamber-pot.</P>
<P>This Man had &s;tood in no Need of Remedies, certainly, for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e the Circulation of the Blood had not been &s;o long &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, but that it could of its own Accord re&s;tore it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>O&s;waldus Gabelchaverus</HI> relates, in one of his Ob|&s;ervations quoted by <HI>Schenkius,</HI> the Hi&s;tory of a Merchant of the Name of <HI>Landthtaler,</HI> who was hang'd on a Tree for &s;ome Villanies he had com|mitted: He hung for a whole Hour, and the Ser|vants who had Orders to inter him, having cut the Rope, perceived, as they thought, &s;ome Marks of Life in him, upon which they put him in a Cart, convey'd him to a proper Place, and &s;oon re&s;tored him to Life. He afterwards us'd to &s;ay, that he was &s;en&s;ible of no Pain in hanging, except in his Eyes, and the Extremities of his Toes. About eighteen Years after, however, he began to follow the &s;ame Practices, for which he had been hang'd before; but <HI>Prince</HI> Charles <HI>of Aremberg</HI> ordered him to be hang'd a &s;econd Time, in &s;uch a Man|ner, that he never returned to Life.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;arien&s;is in Illu&s;tr. Mirac. Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>Cap.</HI> 24. re|lates the Hi&s;tory of a certain Robber, who had been hang'd a little before a Servant belonging to a Canon of <HI>Cologne</HI> happened to come up to the
<PB N="72" REF="74">Gallows. The Servant imagining there were &s;till &s;ome Remains of Life left in him, cut the Rope, and re&s;tored him to Life, by &s;ome cold Water ta|kenfrom an adjacent Rivulet. The Robber, in the mean time, gradually re&s;uming his Strength, fol|lowed his Deliverer, who was going to the next Town, and ju&s;t as they were talking with each other, the Robber laid hold of the Bridle of the Servant's Hor&s;e, cried out aloud, that the Hor&s;e belonged to him, and &s;wore that the Servant had robb'd him of him: This Debate having drawn to|gether a large Concour&s;e of People, their Indig|nation was &s;o &s;trongly moved again&s;t the Servant, that without hearing what he had to &s;ay in his own Ju&s;tification, they were determined to drag him to the Gallows from which he had lately cut down the Robber: but luckily for the Servant, &s;ome Inhabi|tants of the neighbouring Town, &s;eeing a Con|cour&s;e of People going to the Gallows, which be|longed in common to both Towns, came to &s;ee what the Matter was: then the Crowd &s;uffering the Servant to &s;peak, he related his Adventure, and the Manner in which the Robber had recompenc'd his Service. The Robber being at la&s;t known, was a &s;econd Time hung upon the &s;ame Gallows, in &s;uch a Manner as not to return to Life.</P>
<P>Though the Ground-work of the following Hi&s;|tory re&s;embles the preceeding, yet it differs from it in many Circum&s;tances, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is, the long Time the Criminal continued hang'd.</P>
<P>A Miller near <HI>Abbeville</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> happening to goe near the Place where a Robber had been hang'd the Day before, &s;u&s;pected that he was not dead. Compa&s;&s;ion having induc'd him to &s;atisfy his Su&s;|picion, which was well-founded, he cut him down, laid him in a Cart, convey'd him to his own Hou&s;e,
<PB N="73" REF="75">and u&s;ed &s;uch effectual Means to re&s;tore him to Life, that in fifteen Days the Robber recovered perfect Health. The Miller upon this intended to give him a little Money, and take his Leave of him; but delaying for &s;ome Time to put that Intention in Execution; he left him one <HI>Sunday</HI> alone in his Hou&s;e; the mi&s;erable Wretch forgetting what he owed to his Deliverer, broke open a Cupboard, and carried off all the Plate and ready Money he could find. The Miller, upon coming home, and finding his Hou&s;e robbed, ea&s;ily concluded, that his Gue&s;t was the Per&s;on who had done it: accord|ingly the Miller, his two Sons, and a Cart-driver, pur&s;uing the Robber, overtook him about a League off, and dragging him to the Gallows, whence he had been cut down, hung him up a &s;econd Time, and gave him &s;uch Shocks, that they put it out of his Power to commit any more Robberies. It is about forty Years &s;ince this Accident happen'd, and Doctor <HI>Bruhier</HI> informs us, that it is atte&s;ted by Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Reputation in <HI>France;</HI> and a Pardon was actually procured for the Miller, his Sons, and Servant, who took the Liberty of exe|cuting the Robber, without legal Authority.</P>
<P>Before we put an End to this Treati&s;e, which we intend for the common Good and Benefit of Man|kind, we &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething with Re&s;pect to the Methods of pre&s;erving the Lives of Children, who appear dead when born. No two Abu&s;es then, are more prejudicial to Society, contrary to Humanity, or incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, than to inter Women big with Child, without performing the <HI>Cae&s;arian</HI> Operation upon them; and without any Attempts of Relief, totally to abandon Children who &s;eem to be born dead.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e Abu&s;es is founded on two Errors; the fir&s;t of which is, that the Infants do not &s;urvive their Mothers, when they die near their
<PB N="74" REF="76">Time; an the &s;econd, that the Lives of Children depend ab&s;olutely on tho&s;e of their Mothers. Now the&s;e two Errors are de&s;troyed by &s;everal Hi&s;tories, which prove, that the Death of the Mother does not nece&s;&s;arily produce that of the Child.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;par Reies,</HI> then, in his <HI>Campus Ely&s;ius Jucun|darum Que&s;tionum,</HI> relates from <HI>Cornarius,</HI> <Q>"That a Woman of <HI>Madrid,</HI> of the illu&s;trious Ho&s;e of <HI>La&s;&s;o,</HI> being reputed dead, after remaining three Days, in the utmo&s;t Agonies, was put in|to the Tomb belonging to the Family, which being open'd &s;ome Months after, her Corps was found, with an Infant tenderly gra&s;ped in her right Arm; for, continues the Author, the Woman was pregnant, an near her Time, when &s;he was interr'd as dead."</Q></P>
<P>The following Hi&s;tory is al&s;o related, by the &s;ame Author, and atte&s;ted by &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned and judicious Men in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><Q>"The Wife of <HI>Francis Arevallo de Swa&s;&s;o,</HI> fell ill in the City of <HI>Segovia,</HI> during the la&s;t Months of Ge&s;tation: However, as &s;he died, or rather was taken for dead, in a few Days &s;he was in|terr'd, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Place. The Hu&s;b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, in the mean time, who was &s;ent for to a Place at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance, whi|ther he had gone about &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, came home about the Middle of the Night, and being informed that his Wife, whom he loved to Ex|ce&s;s, was dead and buried, he would at any Rate have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing her once more: For this Purpo&s;e, he went to the Church, and ordered her to be rai&s;ed from the Grave; hard|ly was the Coffin open'd, till the Cries of a In|fant were heard; the By-&s;tanders were a&s;toni&s;h|ed, a Ju&s;tice was called, the Prie&s;ts, and a great many others got Flambeaus, and attended the
<PB N="75" REF="77">Hu&s;band; the Shroud was lifted up immedi|ately, upon which appeared the Head of an In|fant, making a vigorous Effort to di&s;engage the Re&s;t of its Body from the Vagina. This Infant was not only extracted, &s;ound, and alive, but al|&s;o lived to be Lieutenant General of the City of <HI>Cherez.</HI> The &s;urprizing Manner in which he came into the World, laid a Foundation for his being called, <HI>The Son of the Earth.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e Hi&s;tories, <HI>Ca&s;par Reies</HI> draws the following Con&s;equence. <Q>"'Tis evident that Children dont die with their Mothers when the latter die near the Periods of their Deliveries. <HI>Sennertus</HI> affirms, not only that they live for &s;ome Time after their Mothers are dead, but al&s;o that we may, and even ought, to extract them alive from the Uterus, <HI>Vincelius</HI> has com|pos'd two Treati&s;es in order to prove the&s;e Truths, which are al&s;o &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Di&s;&s;ertations of <HI>Nymman, De Vita Foetus in Utero,</HI> where, as well as in other Authors we find a great many &s;imilar Hi&s;tories; and others of Women who have been deliver'd of live Children after their own Death. The Reader may al&s;o con&s;ult <HI>Raynaud de ortu Infantum contra Naturam.</HI> Hence 'tis obvious, that we ought not to be too ra&s;h and precipitate in burying pregnant Women who die near their Times. I am not certain whether the&s;e Women were dead or alive at the Time of their Interment, tho' it appears evident from the Circum&s;tances, that the fir&s;t was buried alive; for <HI>Hor&s;tius</HI> proves from another Fact, that dead Women may be deliver'd of Children. Thus he informs us that a Woman big with Child, being hang'd along with her Hu&s;band by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, be|tween
<PB N="76" REF="78"><HI>Deventer</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> was four Hours after her Death, deliver'd of live Twins."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Bartholin</HI> in <HI>Act. Ha&s;n. An.</HI> 1673 relates an Hi&s;tory which proves the &s;ame Truth, and which is, <Q>"That of a Child born two Days after the Death of its Mother, which happen'd in a La|bour, in which three Midwives had employ'd all their Art and Skill. Thus 'tis certain from Ex|perience, that dead Women may be deliver'd of live Children, and this has perhaps laid a Found|ation for the whim&s;ical and &s;uper&s;titious Practice of putting into the Coffins of Women who die big with Child, a Needle, a Thread, and a Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars, as if the Manes &s;tood in Need of tho&s;e In&s;truments to tie and cut the umbilical Chord of the Infant about to be born. In &s;hort it has been ob&s;erv'd, that Infants have been born in the Coffins of their Mothers."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Author al&s;o mentions a Woman who in 1635, on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> about 9 o'Clock at Night died of Epileptic Fits. On the <HI>Friday</HI> the Foam was di&s;charg'd from her Mouth, Cries re&s;embling tho&s;e of an infant were heard, and a &s;en&s;ible Mo|tion was ob&s;erv'd in the Abdomen of the Mother. On <HI>Saturday</HI> about 10 o'Clock in the Morning, the Woman di&s;charg'd a great deal of Blood, &s;o that on changing her Linnen, her Infant &s;till warm, was found lying betwixt her Things. <HI>Bartholin</HI> adds, that the Phy&s;icians of the Town were of Opinion that the Mother had only died when her Mouth be|came full of Froth, without which Circum&s;tance the Infant could not probably have liv'd.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Mi&s;cellanea Naturae Curio&s;.</HI> we have In|&s;tances of Women who have died near their Time, and been deliver'd &s;ometimes of dead, &s;ometimes of live Children, &s;ometimes one, two, and three Days after their Deaths. The&s;e In&s;tances are re|corded
<PB N="77" REF="79">by <HI>Re&s;ler,</HI> fir&s;t Phy&s;ician to the Prince of <HI>Brieg</HI> in <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 318. <HI>An.</HI> 3. By <HI>Poli&s;ius</HI> in <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 42. <HI>An.</HI> 4. By <HI>Doleus</HI> in <HI>Decus.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> 5. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 137. By <HI>Hoyer</HI> in <HI>Decur.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> and la&s;tly by <HI>Hartmanus</HI> in <HI>Ob&s;ervat.</HI> 83. of the &s;ame Volume.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid 'tis &s;ufficiently obvious, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons are greatly mi&s;taken who &s;up|po&s;e that the <HI>Foetus</HI> does not &s;urvive its Mother; for it is evinc'd from a Number of Ob&s;ervations, that the Life of the <HI>Foetus</HI> is &s;u&s;tain'd by a Circula|tion peculiar to it&s;elf; that the umbilical Arteries, which terminate in the Placenta, convey thither a Quantity of Blood, which is carried back by the umbilical Vein, without pa&s;&s;ing to the Mother; and that, if this Blood undergoes any Change, it is only from a lymphatic or lacteal Liquor, which the Roots of the Placenta imbibe from the uterine Ve&s;&s;els. The&s;e Truths are at pre&s;ent univer&s;ally a|greed upon; &s;o that before the Death of the Mo|ther can de&s;troy the Life of the Child, 'tis nece&s;&s;a|ry to prove, Fir&s;t, That the lacteal Liquor cea&s;es to be filtrated immediately after the Death of the Mother: Secondly, That the Suppre&s;&s;ion of this Filtration is an infallible, or even nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;e of Death. In Con&s;equence of this, we mu&s;t prove, that at every Circulation, the Juices of the <HI>Foetus</HI> have their nutritive and vivifying Principles ex|hau&s;ted; and that the Foetus is incapable of &s;u|&s;taining in the Uterus a Degree of Fa&s;ting, which it often &s;upports for &s;everal Days after it is brought into the World. Now, as the&s;e Propo&s;itions can|not be proved, &s;o it cannot be evinced, that the Death of the Mother is nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceeded by that of the <HI>Foetus;</HI> &s;o that 'tis certain, we commit mani|fe&s;t Homicide, by interring pregnant Women near their Time, without performing the <HI>Cae&s;arian</HI> Operation upon them.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="80">
<P>This is no new Doctrine, &s;ince in the <HI>Dige&s;t Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Tit.</HI> 8. the&s;e Words occur; <Q>"A Royal E|dict prohibits the Interment of dead pregnant Woman, before we have delivered them, by Means of the <HI>Cae&s;arian</HI> Operation. Tho&s;e, who do otherwi&s;e appear, to have de&s;troyed with the pregnant Woman the Hope of obtaining a living Man."</Q> It is highly to be lamented, that this Law is not univer&s;ally put in Execution, &s;ince it is a Principle founded on the eternal and unalterable Nature of Things; <HI>That we kill tho&s;e whom we do not pre&s;erve, when we have it in our Power.</HI></P>
<P>If it &s;hould be objected, that this Operation would, if not always, yet at lea&s;t very often, prove an u&s;ele&s;s Attempt. I an&s;wer, that it is, an ea&s;y Operation, &s;ince it is performed by two or three Strokes of the Bi&s;tory, and a few Stitches of a Needle. Be&s;ides, though Children after this Ope|ration &s;hould appear dead, yet we are not to tru&s;t to tho&s;e Appearances, unle&s;s Putrefaction &s;hould remove all Doubt.</P>
<P><HI>Bhonius</HI> informs us, that the Faculty of Medi|cine at <HI>Wurtemberg</HI> being con&s;ulted, in a criminal Proce&s;s rais'd again&s;t a Mother for killing her own Child, an&s;wered, that Children were &s;ometimes born &s;o weak, as to appear for a con&s;iderable Time without Sen&s;ation, Motion, and Re&s;piration; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e vellications, Fomenta|tions, A&s;per&s;ions of Wine, Spirits of Wine, or <HI>Aqua Vitae;</HI> as al&s;o to make them &s;wallow aroma|tic Liquors, or blow &s;pirituous Liquors into their Mouths and No&s;trils, till they begin to cry, which is an infallible Mark that the Air has entered the Lungs.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Mea&s;ures, we have before &s;hewn, that they have an evident Tendency to re&s;tore Life. But we mu&s;t not here pa&s;s over a Practice, which,
<PB N="79" REF="81">of all others &s;eems to be of the greate&s;t Impor|tance to &s;till-born Children, which is, the &s;ucking the left Nipple of the dead Foetus. This Method, as we are told in <HI>Ephemerid. Natur. Curio&s;. Dec.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> 5. prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful, after vellications, Fric|tions, &s;pirituous Liquors, and other Methods had been tried in vain. Various other In&s;tances of the Succe&s;s of this Practice are found in the &s;ame Work, and in the Writings of other practical Authors. Though this Method may at fir&s;t &s;eem ridiculous, yet it will appear of the la&s;t Im|portance to the Anatomi&s;t, who knows the Sen&s;ibi|lity of the Brea&s;t, all who&s;e Nerves center in the Nipple. <HI>Hannemaun</HI> al&s;o, orders a Sponge dipt in Red Wine, or <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> to be applied to the left Brea&s;t, and Pit of the Stomach, of &s;till-born Chil|dren. <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> when &s;peaking of &s;uch new-born Chil|dren, as are exce&s;&s;ively weak, or hardly appear to be alive, orders a robu&s;t, &s;ound Man to breath in|to their Mouths, immediately after he has drank a Dram of Brandy.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Method of re&s;toring &s;till-born Chil|dren to Life is, to blow into their Mouths, as is obvious, from various well-atte&s;ted Ob&s;erva|tions, with two of which we &s;hall put a Period to this Work.</P>
<P><HI>Borelli in Hi&s;t. Cent.</HI> 3. <HI>Ob&s;erv.</HI> 58. relates, that a Servant returning from the Fields, and finding his Ma&s;ter, whom he greatly lov'd, lying dead, he embraced him for a long Time, and by ac|cidentally breathing in his Mouth, gradually re|&s;tored him to Life.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Grubelius,</HI> in <HI>Mi&s;cellan. Nat. Curio&s;. Dec.</HI> 2. <HI>An.</HI> 10. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 44. informs us, that whil&s;t a Phy&s;ician was preparing the Remedies proper to re&s;tore to Life, a Woman, who had fallen into &s;uch a <HI>Syncope,</HI> that &s;he was thought dead,
<PB N="80" REF="82">her own Servant, who had a great Attachment to her, re&s;tored her to Life by blowing in her Mouth. But 'tis probable, that this Method produces its happy Effects, rather by re&s;toring the Motion of the Blood and Lungs, than by Means of that vivifying Principle, which &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious Authors &s;uppo&s;e to be lodg'd in the human Breath.</P>
