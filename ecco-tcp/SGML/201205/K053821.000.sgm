<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>KNowing your Ability in Phy&s;ick, as well as your good and great Character in Divinity, and pre&s;uming in the inter-change of your Studies, you had &s;ometimes met with the Subject, I here pre&s;ent you with, I &s;ubmit it to your im|partial Judgment and Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>When I came fir&s;t to re&s;ide in the&s;e Parts, nothing was more nois'd among the Vulgar (in ca&s;e of any Illne&s;s) than the wonderful Skill &s;ome Men had, above others, in <HI>Water-judgment,</HI> by <HI>&V;rinal Prog|no&s;tication.</HI></P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>This put me upon the mo&s;t diligent Search I cou'd make, and having con&s;ul|ted many Books on that Subject, I found no great Satisfaction in the matter; yet &s;ometime after, peru&s;ing a &s;mall Treati&s;e, intitul'd <HI>Tractatus Epi&s;tolaris de &V;rinis,</HI> &amp;c. (which proving <HI>multum in parvo,</HI> more am|ple, tho' brief, than any I had yet read) I forthwith Tran&s;lated it, and having ad|ded &s;ome Collections from other Authors, I &s;ubjovn'd &s;ome late Ob&s;ervations in my own Practi&s;e, all which was de&s;ign'd, for my own proper u&s;e only: but hearing very fre|quently, of the many grand Impo&s;itions, on a better &s;ort of People, than the meer Vul|gar, by &s;ome bold Quacking <HI>Medica&s;ters,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to Print the following Di&s;cour&s;e, hoping thereby, that pa&s;&s;ing through many Hands, it might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, prevent the too much abus'd Credulity of &s;ome.</P>
<P>For indeed, too too many have been &s;o long impos'd upon, that their Faith of the matter is grown &s;o great, that they believe tho&s;e bold Pretenders, by the bare in&s;pection of a little <HI>Pi&s;s,</HI> through a Gla&s;s, (Conjurer like) can di&s;cover the greate&s;t Secrets in Nature, and unfold the mo&s;t
<PB REF="4">difficult and mo&s;t intricate Ca&s;es of all Di&s;ea&s;es; Nay, I &s;uppo&s;e, by a bare &s;hake of the Urinal, they can, as well fore-tell, what number of Corns a Man has on his Toes, or what number of Teeth, an Old Woman has in her Head.</P>
<P>Yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s indeed, &s;ome gue&s;s pretty well at the matter; for, 'tis not long &s;ince a good Woman in out Neigh|bour-hood, carry'd her Daughter to a fam'd <HI>&V;rinal-Conqua&s;&s;ator,</HI> for his advice; who after a demure View of the Virgin-like Water, and a little handling of the tume|fy'd Dam&s;el, told the poor Woman, her Daughter was Liver-grown, that her Liver was doubled, (had two Livers) which was too true indeed; for, the poor Wench was big with Child, and vi&s;ible to almo&s;t every Eye, but the fond doting Mother's. How great a Con&s;ter|nation the poor Woman was in, at &s;o mon&s;trous a Relation, I will not here, trouble you with, to recite.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now add no more, but that I may pre-&s;uppo&s;e, that this Pi&s;-pot Di&s;|cour&s;e will not &s;avour well, in the No&s;trils

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ancients in the very Infancy of Phy&s;ick made &s;trict Enquiries into the Nature of <HI>Urines,</HI> fetching thence their practical directions; for hence 'twas the great <HI>Hippocrates</HI> e&s;peci|ally took the mea&s;ures of his Fore-knowledge and Precepts, in pa&s;&s;ing Judgment on the Sick, and choo|&s;ing the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;ons for Phy&s;ick. So that 'twas unlawful not to ob&s;erve that famous, ancient and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Maxim among Phy&s;icians, <HI>viz. to purge Concocteds, without a right con&s;ultation of the Chamber-pot.</HI> And this indeed &s;eems mo&s;t agreea|ble to the mo&s;t common rea&s;on, that &s;ince we can|not throughly re-&s;earch the inmo&s;t Retirement of a Sick Body, (which is like a Ve&s;&s;el clo&s;e &s;hut up,) we &s;hould take the hints of Judging from the inge&s;t|ed Liquor, which in its pa&s;&s;age wa&s;hes over every part, drawing from mo&s;t a Tincture, and carrying off &s;ome loo&s;e Particles with it. For <HI>Urines</HI> are as cer|tain Indications of the Con&s;titutions and Ill-tem|peraments of our Bodies, (when a right Judgment is made) as Waters betray the nature of that Mi|neral, through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Contemplation of this, tho' the ba&s;e&s;t Excrement, is become the Subject of a Science, and hath exercis'd the Wits of the mo&s;t Renowned
<PB REF="7">Phy&s;icians, both Ancient and Modern; concerning which are many Books extant, compil'd with the greate&s;t diligence, in which are enumerated the various differences of <HI>Urines,</HI> of their Colours and diver&s;ities of con&s;i&s;tence. The Contents are exactly de&s;crib'd, and for every of the&s;e, di&s;tinct Precepts of Water judgment are deliver'd, which by &s;ome are thought &s;o certain, as if the bare In&s;pection of <HI>Urine,</HI> gave intimation of every Di&s;ea&s;e or af|fected Part, nay every minute Accident concern|ing the Sick. But in this the Vulgar are mo&s;t e|gregiou&s;ly cheated, and yet are ob&s;tinately wilful to be impos'd upon. For they maintain, none can di&s;cover the Di&s;ea&s;e, nor fore-tell any thing of it, except be con&s;ult the Chamber-pot; and unle&s;s the Doctor undertakes to Divine by his Urinal, (as 'twere by a Magick Gla&s;s) they value him not a ru&s;h. But for what in truth concerns the Precepts and Rules upon which the practice of Water-in&s;pection is bottom'd, there are many things found out by diligent Ob&s;ervation, and then confirm'd by &s;ound judgment. Yet becau&s;e the intimation of <HI>Urine</HI> is too largely &s;tretch'd by &s;ome to particular Ca&s;es, very many &V;ncertainties interwoven, and &s;ome thing's plainly fal&s;e, be&s;ides what are liable to errour; who&s;oever therefore, by this Water guide only, confidently de&s;cants on the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Sick, de&s;ereves the name rather of a <HI>Juggler,</HI> than a fair Practitioner. But this Doctrine of <HI>Urines</HI> is every where &s;o full of errors; becau&s;e its Practical Ob|&s;ervations are ill made, or not well Methodiz'd. It may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected, that the Ob&s;ervations are not rightly made, &s;ince from one or other particu|lar Ca&s;e, a general Rule is drawn.</P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>For example: Becau&s;e &s;ome <HI>Drop&s;ical</HI> Per&s;ons make a thin Watery-<HI>Urine</HI> therefore 'tis Canon'd, that &s;uch <HI>Urines</HI> are the undoubted Symptoms of a <HI>Drop&s;y;</HI> when indeed, in &s;ome other Affects, the &s;ame kind of <HI>Urine</HI> is made: And &s;ometimes in <HI>Drop&s;ies</HI> the <HI>Urine</HI> is thick and of a deep Red.</P>
<P>Again, what is vulgarly mo&s;t receiv'd, is for the mo&s;t part uncertain, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Urine</HI> upon which there &s;wims a Scum (like that on Water wherein <HI>Tartar</HI> has been boyl'd doth &s;ignifie a <HI>Con&s;umption,</HI> when this &s;ign is more proper and familiar to <HI>Hypochondriacks,</HI> than <HI>Con&s;umptive</HI> Per&s;ons, and al&s;o very many, without this &s;ign, die of a <HI>Con&s;umption.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what is generally affirm'd is altogether fal&s;e, that the nature of any Affect is di&s;covera|ble by <HI>Urines;</HI> becau&s;e, &s;ometimes tho&s;e that are di&s;ea&s;ed make water like &s;ound Men: and &s;ome|times tho&s;e who &s;eem to be &s;ufficiently in health, by rea&s;on of &s;ome accident (perhaps the Food they have eaten) make &s;u&s;picious <HI>Urine,</HI> and &s;uch as are e&s;tranged from a natural &s;tate. As to the Method or Doctrine of <HI>Urines</HI> deliver'd by mo&s;t, it looks altogether Empirick-like, and not at all rational. For the naked differences of <HI>Urines</HI> are recited, as they are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;ht in their Colour, Con&s;i&s;tence and Contents: Then to every of the&s;e kinds are oppos'd Pathological, <HI>i. e.</HI> Af|fect de&s;cribing &s;ignifications, only collected from more unu&s;ual Ob&s;ervations; when in the interim neither the Cau&s;es of <HI>Phaenomenons</HI> or preterna|tural alterations (as ought to have been) are a&s;|&s;ign'd, neither is the intimation of <HI>Urines</HI> apply'd
<PB REF="9">to the Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es, but only to the Di&s;ea&s;e or its Symptom.</P>
<P>Therefore 'tis very often deceitful and uncer|tain, by rea&s;on the Morbifick Cau&s;e and Intima|tion of the &s;ame <HI>Urine,</HI> may indifferently at the &s;ame time, point at divers Di&s;ea&s;es and Symptoms medimely.</P>
<P>For Example: Thin and watri&s;h-<HI>Urine</HI> very often unmediately &s;ignifies want of Concoction in the Bowels: Yet by rea&s;on of the &s;tate of Crudity, oftentimes the <HI>Green-&s;ickne&s;s</HI> in Virgins, &s;ome|times the <HI>Drop&s;y,</HI> or white and Phlegmatick Swelling of the whole Body, &s;ometimes the <HI>Head|ach</HI> and many other Affects al&s;o ari&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>OF URINE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Principles and chief Accidents of <HI>Urine.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>URINE</HI> new made, or after putrefacti|on by long dige&s;tion, may be Chymi|cally re&s;olv'd into the&s;e Principles. By Di&s;tillation, 1&s;t, A &s;mall Spirit, like that of Wine diluted with Water, a&s;cends; but in &s;o little a quantity, that 'tis not ea&s;ily ta|&s;ted: This is &s;ucceeded by a watery Liquor con&s;iderable in quantity, intermix'd with &s;ome loo&s;er particles of <HI>Salt,</HI> and principally <HI>Sulphur:</HI> 3dly, A very penetrative Water is exhal'd, com|monly call'd <HI>Spiritus Urinae,</HI> which has but lit|tle of the Wine-like Spirit, being generally only a Phlegm very much &s;harpen'd with <HI>Salt;</HI> where|fore, as in Vinegar di&s;till'd, it a&s;cends la&s;t.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Urine</HI> is volatile, and of Vinegar fluid, therefore the di&s;till'd Liquor impregnated with the particles of this, is very Acid; but what's incorporated with the &s;aline particles of the other, is very &s;harp and pungi|tive.</P>
<P>'Tis hence evident, That the <HI>Spiritus Urine</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="13">(commonly &s;o call'd) owes its &s;harpne&s;s e&s;pecial|ly to <HI>Salt;</HI> becau&s;e tho' mo&s;t &s;ubtile, it takes not flame; but extingui&s;heth it, if pre&s;ented to it.</P>
<P>After Di&s;tillation, and the remaining moi&s;ture being wholly evaporated, another portion of <HI>Salt</HI> with a little Earth remains in the bottom of the Matra&s;s, out of which by a &s;tronger heat, a <HI>Volatile Salt</HI> may be &s;ublim'd, leaving the earthy Dregs behind.</P>
<P>This Anatomy of <HI>Urine,</HI> plainly &s;hews, That the Principles whereof it con&s;i&s;ts, are mo&s;t <HI>Wa|ter</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI> a little <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and very little <HI>Spirit.</HI> We may di&s;cern the Saltne&s;s of <HI>Urines</HI> by Ta&s;te and Touch; in Ta&s;te it comes neare&s;t a Nitrous Salt, and proceeds from the &s;alt Particles of what we eat, which by Conco|ction in the Ve&s;&s;els, is for the mo&s;t part elabo|rated into a Volatile Salt, <HI>i. e.</HI> a <HI>Salt</HI> and cer|tain Spirit, which by their long and mutual com|bination are knit together in the clo&s;e&s;t tye: hence Salt it &s;elf otherwi&s;e fix'd, is volatiliz'd, and (as 'twere by the Wing of another) becomes not unfit for motion.</P>
<P>From the different Di&s;po&s;itions of our Bodies, <HI>Urines</HI> contain more or le&s;s <HI>Salt,</HI> and that (ac|cording to the Accidents) more volatile or fix'd, and therefore are different in Colour and Con|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>That there's <HI>Sulphur</HI> in <HI>Urines,</HI> their &s;peedy putrefaction and &s;tink &s;ufficiently prove; and it proceeds from the &s;aline-&s;ulphureous Particles of Nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Of this Sulphur there's le&s;s than in Blood, the Horns of Animals, or Soot; (and therefore in the
<PB N="3" REF="14">Di&s;tillation of <HI>Urine,</HI> nothing almo&s;t Oily or Fat a&s;cends) for while the Blood circulates, the &s;pi|rituous and &s;ulphureous Bodies which depart from it, for the mo&s;t part evaporate: In the interim, the &s;aline and watery reliques make up the <HI>Urine.</HI> Yet <HI>Urines</HI> always have &s;ome <HI>Sulphur,</HI> but the quan|tities and proportion are diver&s;ly altered, accord|ing to the different degrees of Concoction and Crudity; hence proceed the changes of heat and con&s;i&s;tence in <HI>Urines.</HI> That the wine-like Spi|rits of <HI>Urine</HI> are but few, 'tis evident from the defect in the Liquor fir&s;t Di&s;till'd, as al&s;o from the &s;udden putrefaction of <HI>Urine;</HI> but the inte|&s;tine motion of the Particles in <HI>Urine,</HI> conclude &s;ome; <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;eparation of Thin from Thick, and the &s;pontaneous divi&s;ion of &s;ome parts from others, and the collection of that <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is,</HI> or thick &s;ub&s;tance which generally &s;ub&s;ides, at the bottom of <HI>Urine;</HI> be&s;ides, the &s;aline Particles (in|a&s;much as they become volatile) are clo&s;ely wed|ded to the &s;pirituous, and therefore become more brisk in motion and quick of energy. Yet accord|ing to the different plenty and prevalency of Spirits in <HI>Urines,</HI> there are divers modes of tho&s;e <HI>Nubeculae,</HI> or Urine-clouds, and al&s;o of the Sediments, and the <HI>Urines</HI> them&s;elves, have a more quick or &s;low putrefaction. The watry-part in <HI>Urine,</HI> far exceeds the re&s;t in quantity, as being almo&s;t &s;ix times more than the other: And by Di&s;tillation 'tis not &s;o clearly &s;eparated, but that &s;ome vola|tile parts of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> a&s;cend together with it, which tincture it with an ingrateful &s;ent.</P>
<P>This has its original from a plentiful inge&s;tion of Liquids with Food, which yet of what kind
<PB N="4" REF="15">&s;oever they be, lo&s;e their proper Qualities, and ac|quire others, before their change into <HI>Urine;</HI> for nothing almo&s;t &s;incere of that Liquor we drink, be&s;ides moi&s;ture, barely remains in the Pi&s;s.</P>
<P>The di&s;tillation and evaporation of <HI>Urine,</HI> plainly demon&s;trate, that there's &s;ome portion of Earth, as well as &s;limy-muddy Dreggs in it; for when all the liquid parts are exhal'd, the Earth, as a <HI>Caput mortuum,</HI> remains in the bottom in a moderate quantity.</P>
<P>For in the Nutritive Juice, be&s;ides the active Principles of <HI>Salt, Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> is requir'd &s;omething &s;olid, whence Bodies have their bulk and magnitude. The Recrements and earthy Dreggs of this, are plentifully di&s;&s;olv'd in the &s;erous part, making the contents of a more thick con&s;i&s;tence; but this is different according to the variable State of Concoction and Crudity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Principles which make up the Body of <HI>Urine,</HI> into which, by Chymi&s;try 'tis ea&s;ily re&s;olvable.</P>
<P>From the combinations and various admix|tures of the&s;e, the other Accidents of <HI>Urine, viz.</HI> Quantity, Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence, which are &s;en|&s;ibly the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable in it, and from hence the e&s;pecial Objects of Urine-judgment, do ari&s;e; for when almo&s;t nothing be&s;ides is di&s;cernible in <HI>Urine,</HI> tho&s;e make the fir&s;t <HI>Phaenomenons,</HI> in the right &s;olution of which, the whole Hypothe|&s;is of this Science con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Wherefore in the next place, I &s;hall Treat of the&s;e; and fir&s;t, concerning the <HI>Urines</HI> of &s;ound Men, what is their Quantity, Colour, Con&s;i&s;tence and Contents; as al&s;o I &s;hall endeavour to de|clare
<PB N="5" REF="16">upon what mixture of Elements, what Con|coction of the Bowels and Ve&s;&s;els, every one of the&s;e depend,</P>
<P>In the next place it &s;hall be &s;hew'd, how far the <HI>Urines</HI> of &s;ick Per&s;ons, differ from the Rule and Standard of tho&s;e who are &s;ound. And I &s;hall endeavour to a&s;&s;ign the proper Cau&s;es of their change to each of the&s;e Differences; and what I have &s;aid hitherto, &s;hall fini&s;h the fir&s;t &s;cope of my Di&s;cour&s;e, to wit, the Anatomy of <HI>Urine.</HI></P>

But the&s;e (when hun|ger and thir&s;t urge) are more plentifully requir'd, that they may &s;ufficiently dilute the Ma&s;s of <HI>Chyle,</HI> for its right Fermentation in the Bowels; as al&s;o that it may &s;erve for a Vehicle, both to convey it into the Ma&s;s of Blood, that the Blood it &s;elf may circulate in the Ve&s;&s;els without Stagnati|on, and to the Nervous Juice, that it may actuate and moi&s;ten the Organs of &s;en&s;e and motion. Thus the &s;erous part having almo&s;t contributed whatever <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Sulphur</HI> it had, gives place to a new Nutritive Humor, and it &s;elf then, as
<PB N="6" REF="17">unprofitable, is carry'd off from the Blood, by the &s;eclu&s;ive help of the <HI>Kidneys.</HI></P>
<P>The Nouri&s;hing Liquor, which at la&s;t is chang'd unto <HI>Urine,</HI> is different in its own nature; &s;ome|times wateri&s;h, &s;ometimes inpregnated with Spi|rits, &s;ometimes with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur;</HI> and ac|cording to the different prevalency of this or that Element in it, many Variations happen: but no liquids wholly and unchanged pa&s;s our Bodies, but in diver&s;e parts, undergo their mutations and loo&s;e &s;ome portion of their quantities, before they be ultimated into Pi&s;s. For the Liquor to be turn'd into <HI>Urine,</HI> being fir&s;t receiv'd into the Sto|mach, and &s;taying there till Concocted, is al&s;o Impregnated with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> of its own or other di&s;&s;olv'd particles, from &s;ome more &s;olid nouri&s;hment; after this, much of it, toge|ther with the Nutritive Juice is mixt with the Blood, with which after long Circulation, and then according to the various temper of the Blood, and its accen&s;ion in the Heart, it receives a further tin|cture of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur;</HI> hence &s;ome portion of it, is deriv'd into the Brain and Nerves, and there being render'd weak and non-Nutritive 'tis final|ly again reduc'd into the ma&s;s of Blood. After that, the more generous part of the <HI>Serum</HI> is &s;pent upon the Blood and the Nervous juice, a great part al&s;o by Sweat and other Emunctories, the re|mainder, while the Blood continually pa&s;&s;eth the Reins, is there &s;eparated from it, either by Percolation, or the Force of &s;ome Fermentation, by way of precipitation, pa&s;&s;ing the Ureters, in|to the Bladder, whence 'tis ejected.</P>
<P>From the Original and view of this &s;erous
<PB N="7" REF="18">part now di&s;crib'd, 'tis evident and that clearly, that the <HI>Urine</HI> ought to an&s;wer the quantity of Liquids inge&s;ted in a proportion &s;omewhat le&s;s, perhaps about a third, which plainly &s;hews the complextion and &s;trength of the Bowels, who&s;e Office is Concoction, and likewi&s;e of the Blood it &s;elf, as al&s;o in &s;ome &s;ort, the temper and di&s;tribution of the <HI>Succus Nervo&s;us:</HI> Moreover it carries with it the &s;igns of the affects of the urinary Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>The quantity of the Urine does not always hit this Rule, but &s;ometimes exceeds, &s;ometimes comes &s;hort, and for a little time, may con&s;i&s;t with a State, not much out of tune; but the long continuance of &s;uch different Accidents argues a &s;ickly condition: Concerning the&s;e, I &s;hall &s;peak among&s;t the <HI>Phaenomenons</HI> of <HI>Urine</HI> in a cra&s;y Body.</P>
<P>In the next place, I con&s;ider the Colour of a &s;ound <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Urine</HI> that is made, after a perfect Con|coction in the whole Body, is of a Citron-colour like a <HI>Lixivium</HI> indifferently boil'd, which without doubt proceeds from the Salt and Sulphur of the Nutritive Juice and Blood, di&s;&s;olv'd by e|bullition in the <HI>Serum.</HI></P>
<P>This Colour ari&s;es not from <HI>Salt</HI> only, (as &s;ome contend) for any Liquor that is impregnated with Salt (except it be evaporated to a certain thik|ne&s;s) doth not at all grow Yellow: And truly the Salt of <HI>Tartar</HI> di&s;&s;olv'd by liquation, yet re|mains clear.</P>
<P>To what's objected concerning a <HI>lixivium</HI> of A|&s;hes; I an&s;wer, the whole quantity of <HI>Sulphur</HI> is not
<PB N="8" REF="19">&s;pent by burning, but the citron colour ari&s;es from &s;ome Salt and other adu&s;t Sulphureous particles cleaving to the a&s;hes, infus'd and incocted in the Liquor. Nor has &s;ound <HI>Urine</HI> this tincture from <HI>Sulphur</HI> only; for Sulphur in a Wateri&s;h <HI>Men|&s;truum,</HI> cannot be di&s;&s;olv'd without the addition of <HI>Salt;</HI> neither parts with any of its tincture without &s;uch addition: and therefore if you dige&s;t Salt of <HI>Tartar</HI> and common <HI>Sulphur</HI> together in Water, or boil Antimony in a Salt <HI>Men&s;trum,</HI> both liquors, Urine like, grow Yellow from thence; even &s;o the Salt and Sulphureous parti|cles of Nouri&s;hment, by dige&s;tion in the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, and by circulation with the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, being minutely divid|ed and througly incocted with the <HI>Serum,</HI> make the <HI>Urine</HI> of a Citron-colour.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;olution of Salt and Sulphur in manner aforemention'd, by which <HI>Urines</HI> become Citron|colour'd, is fir&s;t begun in the Bowels, afterwards perfected in the other Ve&s;&s;els, much depending up|on the Concoction of the Stomach and Inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>For here by the help of Heat, and Fermentati|on, the Nouri&s;hments inge&s;ted are e&s;pecially fer|mented. The tye of mixture being loo&s;ed, the Sulphureous and Saline particles minutely brok|en, are advanc'd into <HI>Chyle,</HI> and then the <HI>Se|rum,</HI> which is the remainder from the concocti|on and di&s;tribution of that Milkie Juice, becomes citron colour'd; as when Salt of <HI>Tartar</HI> and com|mon <HI>Sulphur</HI> are di&s;&s;olv'd together in any Liquor, and &s;ome <HI>Acid</HI> pour'd upon it, it pre&s;ently turns milkie, and &s;oon after, the contents being &s;e|parated <HI>per Sab&s;identiam,</HI> the remainder of the Liquor grows yellow like a <HI>Lixivium.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="20">
<P>But if the Nouri&s;hment, through &s;ome indi&s;|po&s;ition of the Stomach, be not rightly dige&s;ted in the fir&s;t Concoction, as it often happens in a <HI>Pica, Drop&s;ie,</HI> and other Di&s;temperatures of the Bowels, the <HI>Urine</HI> then becomes crude, clear and almo&s;t in&s;ipid like Fountain Water.</P>
<P>But by rea&s;on of the too exalted, or otherwi&s;e deprav'd Ferments of the Bowels; as in the <HI>Scur|vy, Hypocondriack Melancholy,</HI> or in a <HI>Feaveri&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, the particles of nouri&s;hment being too much di&s;&s;olv'd in the fir&s;t Region, the <HI>Urines</HI> become red and thick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serum,</HI> which in the fir&s;t Concoction, as is &s;aid, had got a tincture like <HI>Lie,</HI> being mixt with the Blood, as long as it circulates with it, is yet further concocted and gets a deeper colour; for tho' the throughly concocted particles of Blood are generally &s;eparated into the <HI>Ve&s;icula fellis,</HI> yet partly their incoction in the <HI>Serum</HI> enhances 'its tincture. Hence <HI>Urine</HI> fir&s;t made after Conco|ction is mo&s;t pale; the next made &s;omewhat red; and after long fa&s;ting, yet more deep.</P>
<P>Where the Blood is more cold, as in a <HI>Ca|chexia,</HI> the colour of <HI>Urine</HI> is below its ju&s;t &s;tate; but where the Blood is accended and as 'twere boil'd by a Feaveri&s;h Heat, 'tis of a high Red.</P>
<P>'Tis worthy ob&s;ervation, that &s;ome <HI>Urines,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;ound, made after large drinking, are not colour'd, but pale and wateri&s;h.</P>
<P>Concerning which, the enquiry is, how the <HI>Serum</HI> &s;o &s;uddenly pa&s;&s;es the Stomach, (contrary to common belief) and running through fir&s;t the Chylie-pa&s;&s;ages, then the Veins, Arteries, the Ventricles of the Heart, the turnings and wind|ings
<PB N="10" REF="21">of the Reins and Ureters, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace is &s;ent out of the Body; and be&s;ides, otherwi&s;e than in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, borrows no colour in its pa&s;&s;ages, but lo&s;es its own.</P>
<P>'Tis probable, be&s;ides the long circuit of the Nu|tritive juice, wherein after &s;ome &s;tay in the Sto|mach, it glides down the Inte&s;tines, and thence is carry'd through the <HI>lacteal</HI>-Ve&s;&s;els into new pa&s;&s;ages, and thence into the Veins; (a circuit not to be run in a trice, therefore) 'tis probable, I &s;ay, that there's another more proper pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame Nutritive Juice, by which 'tis pre&s;ent|ly convey'd to the Ma&s;s of Blood and perhaps to the <HI>Succus Nervo&s;us.</HI> Wherefore after long hun|ger, immediately upon Eating, but e&s;pecially up|on Drinking, we find a &s;udden refre&s;hment, which cannot be &s;uppos'd to proceed but from Spirits or Vapours; becau&s;e immediately after &s;uch drinking follows pi&s;&s;ing, and that &s;ooner than the Ma&s;s of Chyle can be thought to be &s;ent out of the Sto|mach. Therefore it &s;eems not improbable, that forthwith a thinner part of the Nouri&s;hing Liquor (that's receiv'd into the Stomach) con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome Spirit and e&s;peially Water, is imbib'd by its Membranes, like a Spunge, and thence in|&s;till'd into the Mouths of the Veins, and is pre&s;ent|ly mixt with the Blood in its return to the Heart. For many are of this opinion, that the Chyle in &s;ome mea&s;ure is immediately deriv'd from the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, through the branches of the <HI>Vena porta</HI> into the Ma&s;s of Blood. And as the lacteal pa&s;&s;ages carry it about in a long Circuit, by which 'tis &s;ent into the de&s;cending Branch of the <HI>Vena cava,</HI> &s;o by a nearer way,
<PB N="11" REF="22">through the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, may it be carry'd into the a&s;cending branch of the &s;ame Vein; for the Blood, being in &s;ome mea&s;ure impoveri&s;ht with its Circulation, returning both ways, ought to be refre&s;hed with a new Juice, before it enters the Heart, to enliven the Ferment there.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the far greater part of Blood is car|ry'd upward, it &s;eems certainly Rea&s;onable, that &s;ome part of the Nutritive Juice &s;hould as 'twere fewel for a new accen&s;ion in the Heart) be con|veyed into the Blood already &s;pent and grown feeble. Many arguments make for this, which to recite, were too large a digre&s;&s;ion from my pre&s;ent &s;cope; wherefore I think 'tis in &s;ome mea|&s;ure after the manner afore&s;aid, that we pi&s;s &s;uch a pale wateri&s;h <HI>Urine,</HI> &s;o &s;oon after drinking.</P>
<P>That Liquor, which from Nouri&s;hment is &s;o &s;pee|dily convey'd into the Ma&s;s of Blood, not pa&s;&s;ing through &s;o many windings, as the membranes of the Bowells, (as if drawn by di&s;tillation, the gro&s;&s;er part rejected) in a manner, is only Wa|ter and Spirit, whereby it may refre&s;h the Vi|tal Spirits and dilute the Blood. In which task, the &s;pirituous part being &s;pent, the wateri&s;h part, being weighty and trouble&s;ome by rea&s;on of its plenty, is continually &s;ent out by the Kidneys; and &s;ince it comes from the Stomach, not as yet embrewed with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> nor is not &s;o long circulated with the blood, as to acquire from thence, a lixivious tincture, tis pi&s;s'd out thin and clear.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Concerning the Con&s;i&s;tence and Contents of the <HI>Urine</HI> of the &s;ound.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto have we di&s;cours'd of the Quan|tity and Colour of <HI>Urines</HI> in &s;ound Bo|dies; but as to the Contents, there ought to be nothing in &s;ound <HI>Urines,</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Nubecula</HI> or <HI>Urine</HI>-&s;loud; and what this is, and how it is form'd, in the next place remains to be ex|plain'd.</P>
<P>While the ma&s;s of Blood is commixt with <HI>&s;e|rum</HI> and the Nutritive humour, 'tis continually circulated in the Ve&s;&s;els; from hence a certain Nutritive Juice, by perpetual dige&s;tion is elabo|rated, which becomes a Nutriment at la&s;t, con|tinually &s;upplying the &s;olid Parts. This at fir&s;t is concocted into a glutinous Humour, not much unlike the white of an Egg; after that, into &s;len|der Filaments, which being interwoven in the pores and little &s;paces of the &s;olid Parts, &s;upply them with an augmentation always of new Sub&s;tance. And while the <HI>Serum,</HI> that is mixt with the Blood, wa&s;hes over all the regions of the Body, it &s;wallows up in it &s;elf a &s;uperfluous part of this la&s;t Nouri&s;hment, de&s;ign'd for the Augmentati|on of the &s;olid Parts, and carries out with it, that which makes the <HI>Urine</HI>-cloud. When this appears (becau&s;e it &s;ignifies Concoction and Nu|trition in &s;ome mea&s;ure) 'tis accounted a lauda|ble &s;ign; but if no &s;uch <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> be vi&s;ible,
<PB N="13" REF="24">'tis a &s;ign of Crudity, as in a <HI>Cachexia</HI> and Dy&s;cra|&s;ie in <HI>Feavers.</HI></P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;lender Filaments (as afore&s;aid) and is di&s;per&s;t thro' the whole body of the <HI>Urine,</HI> and then is gather'd together into one Cloud, Thus; the Filaments are long and &s;omewhat &s;mooth, having &s;ome a&s;perities, bramble-like, &s;o that being mov'd to and fro, they ea&s;ily take hold one of another, and are complicated in them&s;elves; as if we &s;hou'd ca&s;t many Hairs into a Ve&s;&s;el full of Water, and there by often &s;haking, and to&s;&s;ing the Ve&s;&s;el about, the Hairs, which at fir&s;t Swim on the top, here and there, &s;hortly after Mutual|ly embrace, and knit in one knot. After the &s;ame manner, ('tis probable) the Filaments which make up the <HI>Nubecula</HI> or Urine-cloud, being to&s;t too and fro by the innate heat and Spirits of the <HI>Urine,</HI> do concur and knit together, till by a mutual complex of each other they Concenter into one little Cloud; and becau&s;e tho&s;e Fila|ments are more compact and firm, than the re&s;t of the Contents of the Urine, by rea&s;on of their Gravity, they fall to the bottom. 'Tis highly probable, that &s;uch Filaments, in &s;ome Per&s;ons make up the Urine-cloud; becau&s;e the Blood in a good State, and con&s;equently di&s;po&s;ed for Nouri&s;hment, is interwoven with many Fibres or white threads, which any body may di&s;cover by phlebotomy, when the Blood is receiv'd in|to hot Water; therefore 'tis probable that &s;ome divided &s;lender parts of tho&s;e threads, being &s;natch'd along with the <HI>Serum,</HI> are the matter of that Wool-like Sub&s;idence in the Urine: Wherefore in a <HI>Cachexia,</HI> the blood being water|i&s;h
<PB N="14" REF="25">through Crudities, and unfit for Nouri&s;hment, is di&s;titute of tho&s;e Elaborated &s;mall fibrous threads; as likewi&s;e in great Dy&s;cra&s;ies, when by an over ebullition of the Blood, the Nutritive Juice is not rightly concocted into &s;uch like threads, the <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is</HI> or thick Sediment of the <HI>Urine</HI> is either utterly wanting, or very much confus'd and troubled.</P>
<P>A good and laudable Urine-cloud is white, round and equal, falling towards the bottom; and to this is requir'd, fir&s;t, that the Nouri&s;h|ment be rightly elaborated, whereby the Fila|ments may become &s;omewhat &s;mooth, round and firm, like &s;lender threads.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> That the <HI>Urine</HI> be &s;ufficiently Impreg|nated with Spirits, which (as 'tis evident in the Fermentation of new Wine) may drive and exa|gitate the parts to and fro.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> That the Liquor be not too thick, nor its pores prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with other little bodies, whereby it may happen, that the motion of the Contents may be hindred; wherefore there ought to be an ample &s;pace left, to agitate and hurry about &s;uch Particles. If the Urine-cloud be red, 'tis a Sign that the la&s;t nouri&s;hment is render'd adu&s;t, and over concocted by too much Heat; therefore &s;uch a Sediment for the mo&s;t part, is in the beginning of <HI>Feavers,</HI> while the Con|coction of the Bowells and Ve&s;&s;els is not whol|ly preverted. If the <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is</HI> be broken and unequal, 'tis a &s;ign, that the Nutriment de|&s;ign'd for the &s;olid Parts, is not rightly and e|qually concocted, that its particles are not alto|gether Congenerous, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the &s;ame kind, and of
<PB N="15" REF="26">the &s;ame Nature, and therefore the Filaments hang not together Uniformly, but as 'twere af|ter a Separate and confus'd manner of Implicati|on; hence &s;ome that are more cra&s;s, fall to the bottom; others more rare, hang higher. When the &s;ub&s;tance, of which the <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is</HI> is made, doth not altogether fall, but wholly hangs ei|ther in the top or middle Region, it happens thus, either becau&s;e 'tis made of Filaments not perfectly Elaborated, firm and compact, but more thin and Spungy, or becau&s;e the Liquor is more than ordinary Impregnated with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sul|phur,</HI> and therefore like a &s;trong <HI>Lixivium,</HI> bears up that weighty matter, which otherwi&s;e wou'd fall to the bottom.</P>
<P>Some times the <HI>Nubecula</HI> or Urine-cloud is wholly wanting in &s;ound Bodies, after long Hunger, immoderate Labours or extraordinary Sweats, the matter being either wholly &s;pent in Nutriment; or evaporated by Sweat: And.</P>
<P>In <HI>Feavers,</HI> becau&s;e the mixture of the Blood is greatly Deprav'd: in the longing and deprav'd Appetites of Child bearing Women; in a <HI>Ca|chexia</HI> or an ill habit of body, and other &s;uch like Affects, by rea&s;on of the Predominant Cru|dity.</P>
<P>Concerning the Con&s;i&s;tence of &s;ound <HI>Urines,</HI> not many things worthy ob&s;ervation occur. 'Tis commonly like Middle Ale well purify'd by Fermentation, or a <HI>Lixivium</HI> indifferently boil'd: <HI>viz.</HI> The aqueous part of the <HI>Urine,</HI> ought to contain within its pores and &s;paces many particles of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> broke and di&s;olv'd very &s;mall, as al&s;o a little Earth disjoin'd
<PB N="16" REF="27">into the lea&s;t atomes, and di&s;per&s;t throughout the whole body of the <HI>Urine.</HI> If the Con&s;i&s;tence be thinner, than it ought to be, as 'tis &s;een in clear and wateri&s;h. <HI>Urine,</HI> 'tis a Sign of Indige&s;tion and Crudity, that the aliment is not fully con|cocted: but if the <HI>Urine</HI> be more cra&s;s and thick than it ought to be, 'tis a Sign the body of the Liquor is clogg'd with Preternatural Contents; but of the&s;e el&s;ewhere, when we treat of the <HI>Urines</HI> of &s;ick Per&s;ons. Hitherto have we &s;pok|en of <HI>Urine</HI> in a &s;ound Body, both as the Excre|ment and Sign of Concoction rightly perform'd in the Bowells and other Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t take the mea&s;ures of its Quantity from what we drink; its Citron-colour, from <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> di&s;&s;olv'd and incocted in the <HI>Serum.</HI> The <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is</HI> or Contents depend upon the fi|laments elaborated in the ma&s;s of Blood, for the nouri&s;hment of the &s;olid parts. Its Con&s;i|&s;tance is from <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> together with &s;ome particles of Earth, filling up the pores and &s;paces of the &s;erous Part. It remains next, that we treat of the <HI>Urines</HI> of &s;ick Per&s;ons, in which likewi&s;e the Quantity, Colour, Contents and Con|&s;i&s;tence, as al&s;o &s;ome other accidents, offer them|&s;elves to our con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> Of the Quantity and Colour of the <HI>Urines</HI> of Sick Per&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>IN a de&s;ea&s;e or &s;ickly State of Body, the Quan+tity of <HI>Urine</HI> frequently an&s;wers not the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="17" REF="28">proportion of inge&s;ted Liquids; for &s;ometimes there's a Defect, (&s;ometimes an Exce&s;&s;) in the ju&s;t Mea&s;ure, when the <HI>Urine</HI> is far le&s;s than the inge&s;ted Liquors. The rea&s;on of the Defect is, be|cau&s;e the &s;erous part Stagnates &s;omewhere in the Body, or is diverted &s;ome other way, than that of the <HI>Urinary</HI> excretion; For 'tis either <HI>1&s;t,</HI> lodg'd a|about the Bowels and their cavities, and &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;tays longer, than it ought, in the Stomach, by which means 'tis &s;omewhat di&s;tended, cau&s;ing trouble&s;ome Spitting: but more frequently it is lodg'd in the hollow of the Paunch, &s;ometimes in the cavity of the Brea&s;t or Head, and there u&s;ual|ly produces <HI>Drop&s;ical</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es: or <HI>2dly.</HI> the <HI>&s;erum</HI> Stagnates in the Ve&s;&s;els, and thereby augmen|ting the Ma&s;s of Blood and Nervous Liquor, greatly perverts their motion: or <HI>3dly.</HI> that wa|teri&s;h Humour is thrown upon the habit of the Bo|dy and &s;o creates a &s;welling of the whole or &s;ome parts: or <HI>4thly</HI> and la&s;tly 'tis ob&s;tructed in the <HI>Urinary</HI> pa&s;&s;ages, by a Stone or &s;ome Vi&s;cous matter creating Pain and Convul&s;ions in tho&s;e parts, and a Superfluity of <HI>&s;erum</HI> in the whole Body.</P>
<P>But when the <HI>&s;erum</HI> is diverted otherways, it often di&s;po&s;es the Sick to frequent and trouble|&s;ome Sweats, or almo&s;t a continual Flux. The Affects therefore which the deficient Quantity of <HI>Urine</HI> indicates, are Swellings and aqueous colle|ctions of &s;ome Bowels, al&s;o &s;ometimes Rheuma|tick Pains, &s;ometimes an ill Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>genus nervo&s;um,</HI> &s;ometimes an univer&s;al <HI>Drop&s;y</HI> and <HI>phlegmatick</HI> Tumours, and &s;ometimes the
<PB N="18" REF="29">Stone in the Reins and Bladder; &s;ometimes al&s;o the penury of <HI>Urine</HI> is the effect and &s;ign of &s;ome other praeternatural Evacuation, to wit, of Sweat, a <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> or &s;ome other immoderate Ex|cretion. To de&s;cribe every cau&s;e and mode of the office of the <HI>Serum,</HI> either as it is in the Bo|dy, or as it is excern'd thence, were in a manner to bring over hither, the whole matter of all the Affects; for many and diver&s;e are the Occa&s;ions and Circum&s;tances, by rea&s;on of which the <HI>&s;erum</HI> is lodg'd in this or that Part, and by &s;taying in the Body, le&s;&s;ens the quantity of <HI>Urine.</HI> Not|with&s;tanding, the principal and mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of this, is not &s;o much the Vice of the Li|ver, Spleen or Reins, as that of the Blood it &s;elf.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="30">&s;ome Coagulated matter, is ea&s;ily &s;eparated and as 'twere Precipitated from the re&s;t of the Ma&s;s of Blood. Tis the &s;ame in a manner with the Ma&s;s of Blood, what we ob&s;erve in Milke; <HI>viz.</HI> while it grows Hot and almo&s;t Boyling, it ea|&s;ily Curds or Coagulates, and its <HI>Serum</HI> or Whey &s;oon &s;eparates by pouring in a little Runnet or any &s;harp &s;our Liquor; but if it be Cold, though you pour in &s;tronger Ferments and a con&s;iderable quantity of any Acid, &s;carce any Precipitation follows.</P>
<P>Therefore if the Blood become more Cold and Watery from an ill constitution of Diet, &s;o that being le&s;s impregnated with active Particles, its Ebullition is more &s;low, 'tis accended as 'twere piece-meal in the Heart, and circulates very &s;low|ly and with difficulty in the Ve&s;&s;els, and run|ning the cour&s;e of the pores and pa&s;&s;ages in the Fle&s;h and Bowels, &s;ticks by degrees, leaving &s;omething of it &s;elf behind it: whence Ob&s;tructi|ons and Tumours every where accrue.</P>
<P>By this means al&s;o, the Blood being Feeble and Vi&s;cous, is con&s;equently le&s;s &s;it for Precipi|tation or Percolation, and doth not &s;o readily convey its &s;erous Excrements into the Kidneys, but leaves them every where di&s;pers'd in the whole Body, by rea&s;on of the Settlement of &s;ome Humour and Difficulty of Circulation. Wherefore in this State, tho&s;e things which much exagitate the Blood, as Exerci&s;e, &s;wift and frequent Motion; or as tho&s;e things which like Rennet infus'd do precipitate, as Acids and Salt Preparations do, provoke <HI>Urine</HI> more plentiful|ly.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="31">
<P>Sometimes &s;ick Per&s;ons Pi&s;s very copiou&s;ly, &s;o that in the &s;pace of twenty four hours, they e|vacuate twice or thrice as much <HI>Urine</HI> as they have taken Liquids. The cau&s;e of which Effect is divers, and the Signification much different. If af|ter the diminution' of its quantity, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Urine;</HI> if in <HI>drop&s;ical</HI> affects, <HI>Rheumati&s;ms</HI> or other nervous Pa&s;&s;ions, or the <HI>cri&s;is</HI> of <HI>Feavers,</HI> plenty of <HI>Urine</HI> naturally, or by the u&s;e of <HI>Diureticks,</HI> freely en&s;ue, for the mo&s;t part it pre&s;ages the di&s;continuance of the Di&s;ea&s;e and Preternatural Indi&s;po&s;ition; or at lea&s;t, its declen&s;ion. But if (as I have often ob&s;erv'd, without the&s;e fore|going and premention'd effects) the <HI>Urine</HI> far exceeds the inge&s;ted Liquids, and thence en&s;ue a remarkable Debility, this indeed portends an ill State, an inclination to an <HI>Atrophy</HI> or Con&s;umpti|on. I have known &s;ome Women of a &s;lender thin habit of Body, who &s;ometimes being indi&s;|pos'd for many days together, were wont to make in great plenty (above what Liquids they took) a thin Watery <HI>Urine,</HI> without Contents or <HI>Urine</HI>-cloud, at which time, they complain'd of their &s;trength langui&s;hing, difficulty of Breathing, and an inability to Motion.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e in this ca&s;e, the Blood and <HI>Succus Nervo&s;us,</HI> by an exalted and fluid <HI>Salt,</HI> became too acid, and con&s;equently unapt to be in the lea&s;t di&s;&s;olv'd in their mixture, and were too much di&s;pos'd to Sero&s;ities; for 'tis ob&s;ervable, that whatever Liquids, tho' thick and clammy, if kept till &s;our, they pre&s;ently become more thinn and wateri&s;h. Further, 'tis manife&s;t, that tho&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="32">accidental overflowings of <HI>Urine</HI> ari&s;e from &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of the Blood and Humours; for the <HI>Urine</HI> has a Vinegar Smack: and &s;uch affects (as aforemention'd) are ordinarily cur'd by <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Medicines, and not always by com|mon A&s;tringents and Thickners.</P>
<P>Now as to the Colour of the <HI>Urine</HI> of the Sick, that of &s;ound Per&s;ons mu&s;t be the rule and Stand|ard, by which all the re&s;t ought to be try'd and judg'd.</P>
<P>Since then the Colour of theirs who are Sound, ought to be Citron; the <HI>Urine</HI> of tho&s;e that are &s;ick, will either be more Pale than Citron, and &s;o white like common Water; or more deep|ly tinctur'd, and then generally 'twil be either of a Flame or Saffron-colour, Red, Green or Black. In &s;hort, I'le endeavour to appropriate the Cau|&s;es, from which each of the&s;e Alterations proceed, and what Affects or preparations of Di&s;ea&s;es they u&s;ually indicate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Urine</HI> is clear like Water, when by rea|&s;on of the indige&s;tive faculty of the Stomach, the <HI>Saline</HI> and <HI>Sulphureous</HI> particles of our Meat are not &s;o well concocted and minutely broke, that they can be volatiliz'd and di&s;&s;olv'd in the <HI>Serum</HI> to tincture it &s;o deep, as that after all its windings and pa&s;&s;ages it can be&s;peak its Origi|nals.</P>
<P>For Liquids, that are to be chang'd into <HI>Urine,</HI> by rea&s;on they are pre&s;s'd and driven through &s;ecret and very narrow Pa&s;&s;ages, as 'twere by Di&s;tillation, thereby loo&s;e their Colour and Con|&s;i&s;tence which they had when inge&s;ted, and im|bibe
<PB N="22" REF="33">nothing from the Chyle (who&s;e vehicle they are) but what is volatile. Wherefore if by rea|&s;on of eminent Crudity, <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> and o|ther Contents be not fir&s;t volatiliz'd in the Bow|els, nor after, di&s;&s;olv'd in the Ve&s;&s;els &s;o far, as to run the &s;ame cour&s;e with the <HI>Serum,</HI> this at la&s;t, in a manner dive&s;ted of all, is &s;ent out like clear Water. And that &s;uch <HI>Urines</HI> generally want their active Principles, 'tis evident, becau&s;e they are longe&s;t pre&s;erv'd from Putrifaction.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Urine</HI> in Virgins generally &s;ignifies a <HI>Chlo|ro&s;is</HI> or the <HI>Green-Sickne&s;s,</HI> in mo&s;t an ill habit of Body or a <HI>Drop&s;ie;</HI> in &s;ome 'tis a &s;ign of great crudity and the want of Concoction; and &s;ome|times al&s;o, in tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to the <HI>Stone,</HI> it Preindicates an approaching Fit, <HI>viz.</HI> while the <HI>Serum</HI> in the Kidneys is coagulated by an acid fermenting Juice, its Contents being condens'd into a Tartarous matter, a thin wateri&s;h part is only excern'd. They who for a time, (let the Di&s;ea&s;e be what it will) Pi&s;s thin and wateri&s;h, have very often the&s;e Symptoms; difficult and frequent Breathing after motion, Di&s;ten&s;ion about the region of the Stomach, and as 'twere a Swel|ling or Puffing up, after Meat. The rea&s;on of which wholly depends upon want of Volatiliza|tion in the Blood: For, becau&s;e its Liquor is de|&s;titute of active particles rightly exalted, <HI>viz.</HI> (<HI>Spi|rit, Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI>) therefore 'tis not &s;uffici|ently accended by the ferment of the Heart, where|by the whole &s;hould pre&s;ently &s;ally and as 'twere break forth into a Flame; but fermenting with difficulty, and apt to Stagnate, or for the mo&s;t part
<PB N="23" REF="34">to &s;ettle in the Heart, 'tis much oppre&s;s'd by it; wherefore, if the Blood thus di&s;pos'd, be ha&s;ten'd thro' the Ventricles of the Heart, by a motion more quick than ordinary, becau&s;e it has not free Rare|faction, it pre&s;ently &s;allies out, in a manner all at once; therefore there is need of a greater En|deavour, and more frequent Agitation of the Lungs to pump it.</P>
<P>Wateri&s;h <HI>Urines</HI> therefore, fore-tell &s;uch like Crudities in the Blood; becau&s;e if they have re|ceived, in a manner, no tincture from the <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> 'tis a &s;ign their particles are le&s;s di&s;&s;olv'd, or le&s;s volatiliz'd, in the Ma&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P>As to the Di&s;tention of the Stomach, of which clear <HI>Urines</HI> are both an effect and &s;ign; I &s;ay, for want of a due Fermentation, the Chyle is not all changed into a volatile white Sub&s;tance, but (like Bread not fermented) is alter'd and tran&s;|muted into a heavy ponderous Ma&s;s, which is &s;lowly, and not without a Vi&s;cous Phlegme ac|companying it, &s;ent from the Stomach, whole re|liques being fixt to the foldings and membranes of the Stomach, ob&s;truct all its Pores and Pa&s;&s;a|ges, &s;o that nothing can evaporate, and what is more Thin and Spirituous, cannot be carry'd to the Blood forthwith through &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ages as it ought. Hence plenty of Flatulencies or Windi|ne&s;s is engender'd; which &s;peedily &s;tretches the Stomach, blowing it up beyond its proportion. And &s;ince tho&s;e dreggs, by long re&s;idence in the Stomach, abound with a fixt <HI>Salt,</HI> they &s;ometimes degenerate into an Acid, &s;ometimes into a Vitri|oline or other ba&s;e Heterogeneous matter, whence
<PB N="24" REF="35">Violent pains in the Stomach, deprav'd Appetite, violent heat with frequent Thir&s;t, &s;ometimes vi|olent Vomitings and other very grievous Sym|ptoms ari&s;e. Some of which, tho' they argue heat, and that in a great degree, lurke and lye hid within: yet tho&s;e who are thus affected for want of Concoction, often make Crude and Wa|teri&s;h <HI>Urine.</HI> We have thus now largely treat|ed of clear <HI>Urine,</HI> becau&s;e the rea&s;ons of the re&s;t, may be had hence, which are Pale and thin with|out Colour or Con&s;i&s;tence, in tho&s;e who are Sound. For the <HI>Phaenomenons</HI> of Pale &s;traw-colour'd or other Colours below Citron, ari&s;e, and may be explicated after the &s;ame manner we have alrea|dy &s;aid of the Water-like, clear <HI>Urine,</HI> from the greater or le&s;s Di&s;&s;olution and Concoction of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the <HI>Serum.</HI></P>
<P>Another kind of <HI>Urine,</HI> more Pale than Citron, yet remains, not at all Thin but Thick, of a &s;ullied whiti&s;h Colour, which is commonly ob&s;erv'd, Children make, when their Bowels are much troubled with Wormes; the rea&s;on of which &s;eems to be, becau&s;e the matter of which Wormes are ingender'd, is a vi&s;cous Phlegm through in|dige&s;tion of Chyle and want of Volatilization, heapt up in the Bowels, which doth not readily tran&s;mit any tincture to the <HI>Urine,</HI> becau&s;e the matter is fixt; after that, the &s;ame matter putrid|fying, is exalted and volatiliz'd in a manner, and then partly by Heat and Spirit is form'd into Wormes, and that phlegmatick matter, being unfit for nouri&s;hment, 'tis &s;eparated from the Blood with the <HI>Serum</HI> and mixt with the <HI>Urine;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="36">hence that white Colour and whiti&s;h Sediment.</P>
<P>Sometimes in <HI>Feavers,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>Urines</HI> of Children grow white; the rea&s;on of which is, becau&s;e the &s;upply of Nutritive Juice coming from the Chyle to the Ma&s;s of Blood, is not rightly a&s;&s;imilated, but degenerates into an ex|crementitious Humour, a part of which being incocted in the <HI>Serum,</HI> gives it a more thick Con|&s;i&s;tence and milkie-colour, otherwi&s;e than in <HI>Fea|vers</HI> of the Adult, where when the Heat is more &s;trong and vigorous, the mixture of &s;uch Juice tinctures the <HI>Serum</HI> with a deep Red.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o <HI>Urines</HI> appear white, from a <HI>Gonorrhaea, Flour albus, Ulcers</HI> of the Kidneys, Ureters, or Urinary pa&s;&s;age, by rea&s;on of the com|mixture of Matter or corrupted Seed. Howe|ver it be, the white colour of the <HI>Urine,</HI> is pro|duc'd by its Contents, which falling to the bot|tom, the Liquor for the mo&s;t part becomes of a yelowi&s;h-pale Colour, like as 'tis &s;een in the pre|paration of <HI>Lac Sulphuris,</HI> where the Milkie &s;ub|&s;tance falling to the bottom, the Liquor &s;wim|ming above, is commonly of a Citron colour.</P>
<P><HI>Urines</HI> who&s;e Colour is more Inten&s;e, than Citron, owe not their appearances only to the more than ordinary di&s;&s;olution of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sul|phur,</HI> but in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the more cra&s;s Contents in the Liquor.</P>
<P>The plentiful di&s;&s;olution of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> is perform'd in the Ve&s;&s;els containing the very Ma&s;s of Blood, and thence is the Tincture deriv'd up|on the <HI>Serum,</HI> and this for the mo&s;t part, comes to pa&s;s two ways.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="37">
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> either by rea&s;on of a Feaveri&s;h Heat, in as much as the Blood boyling in the Ve&s;&s;els, and being more accended in the Heart, is much weak|ned in its mixture; and therefore the particles of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> which are &s;eparated by Ebulli|tion, plentifully impregnate the <HI>Serum.</HI> Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> without a <HI>Feaver,</HI> when &s;uch like Sul|phureous and Saline little Bodies, which were wont to be &s;ent out at other Emunctories, are detain'd; therefore being heapt up, by little and little in the Blood, they are commixt with the <HI>Serum:</HI> Of which, there are two particular Ca&s;es or Modes for either the Excre|ments of Blood, which e&s;pecially partake of an adu&s;t <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and ought to be &s;ent forth by the <HI>Ve&s;icula Fellis,</HI> are retain'd and &s;o mixing with the <HI>Serum,</HI> tincture it with a yel|low: Or the <HI>Effluviums</HI> which are e&s;pecially of a Saline nature, and were wont to evaporate by in|&s;en&s;ible Tran&s;piration are retain'd, and by them is the <HI>Urine</HI> tinctur'd, like a <HI>Lixivium</HI> or with a Lye-like colour.</P>
<P>All Per&s;ons in the <HI>Jaundi&s;e</HI> have <HI>Urine</HI> of the fri&s;t &s;ort; but that of the latter, is familiar to the <HI>Scurvy;</HI> for in a Scorhutick Habit, the <HI>Sa|line</HI> Particles of Blood fall &s;hort of Volatilizati|on, and become fluid, wherefore by rea&s;on of fixation, they evaporate le&s;s, and being plenti|fully heap'd up in the Ma&s;s of Blood, they great|ly prevent its Mixture, and e&s;pecially impre|gnate the <HI>Serum</HI> with <HI>Salt.</HI></P>
<P>The Contents which augment the colour of <HI>Urine</HI> are of two &s;orts, <HI>viz.</HI> Either the adu&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="38">Recrements, which are the reliques of the Blood's Inflammation: Or the Particles of the Nutritive Juice, degenerated into an unknown Matter; of which, in their proper place hereafter: Our pre|&s;ent Task is, a particular decyphering every Co|lour, that is above Citron.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, The Flame-colour'd <HI>Urine</HI> appears like the yellowi&s;h red Vapours in the Di|&s;tillation of <HI>Spiritus Nitri,</HI> and this is very often found in <HI>Intermitting Feavers,</HI> frequently in <HI>Ter|tians.</HI> This Colour ari&s;es from a &s;mall portion of thin yellow <HI>Choler,</HI> mix'd with the <HI>Serum,</HI> while 'tis in motion; for in this <HI>Feaver</HI> there is a &s;harp and hot Di&s;temperature of the Blood, which burnes and in a manner torrifies all the Humours, and therefore plentifully produceth <HI>Choler.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' this for the mo&s;t part, is &s;ent out by the <HI>Ductus bilarius;</HI> notwith&s;tanding, &s;ince it abounds in the Ve&s;&s;els, part of it, or (what's equivalent) the adu&s;t Particles of Blood and Hu|mours being incocted in the <HI>Serum,</HI> tincture it with a deep yellowi&s;h-red. This <HI>Urine</HI> is Thin and Shining, becau&s;e in this Di&s;ea&s;e, almo&s;t a continual Sweat forces out the Excrements of the Nutritive Juice and the more gro&s;s part of the <HI>Serum,</HI> to the circumference of the Body. The Saffron-colour'd <HI>Urine,</HI> which dies Linnen-cloth with the &s;ame colour, is an undoubted Sign of the <HI>Jaundi&s;e;</HI> and 'tis thus tinctur'd from yellow Choler, or <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> adu&s;t and plentifully mix'd with the <HI>Serum,</HI> For that Yellow is nece&s;&s;arily produc'd by the more than
<PB N="28" REF="39">ordinary continual motion and over-heat of the Blood: And Nature has de&s;ign'd the <HI>Ve&s;icula Fellis</HI> and its pa&s;&s;ages which are radicated in the Liver, for di&s;charging the Choler from the Ma&s;s of Blood. But if this Office of the <HI>Ductus Bila|rius,</HI> in conveying the Gall, be any ways hin|der'd, that Humour &s;tagnating in the Blood and plentifully heap't up there, dies the Skin, Blood, and Urine e&s;pecially, with a yellow Tincture.</P>
<P>A Safftron-colour'd, differs from a Flame-co|lour'd <HI>Urine;</HI> becau&s;e in the la&s;t, only &s;ome part of the thinner, in the fir&s;t, a more cra&s;s and plentiful part of the <HI>Gall</HI> is incorporated with the <HI>Urine:</HI> Farther, in yellow <HI>Choler, Sulphur</HI> being long circulated with an ac|companying <HI>Salt,</HI> is fully di&s;&s;olv'd by it, and becomes like Paint, colouring any Subject with a Saffron tincture, like as when common <HI>Sul|phur</HI> and the Oil of <HI>Tartar</HI> are di&s;&s;olv'd together.</P>
<P>But that Redne&s;s which is in <HI>Urine,</HI> without the &s;tagnation of <HI>Choler,</HI> happens after the &s;ame manner, as in a <HI>Lixivium</HI> or Lie of A&s;hes, where the Particles of <HI>Sulphur</HI> without any pre|di&s;po&s;ition, from tho&s;e of <HI>Salt,</HI> together with them are imbib'd in the Liquor.</P>
<P>In the next place, we will Treat of Red <HI>Urines,</HI> which are of a different Nature, depend upon different Cau&s;es, and many times &s;ignify differ|rent kinds of Affects; the chief of which, and their proper &s;ignifications we'll briefly de&s;cribe. Fir&s;t of all, the Liquor grows red of it &s;elf, re|mains in the &s;ame Condition, neither is the Co|lour of any part of it alter'd by Sub&s;idence. Or,
<PB N="29" REF="40"><HI>2dly,</HI> the deep dye of <HI>Urine</HI> proceeds e&s;pecially from what's contain'd in it; and after its re&s;i|dence to the bottom, it becomes Yellowi&s;h, or le&s;s Red than before. The Affects which &s;uch <HI>Urines</HI> are wont to &s;ignify, are e&s;pecially, <HI>Fea|vers, Scurvy,</HI> and a confirm'd <HI>Con&s;umption.</HI></P>
<P>Let's con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons of each. When the <HI>Urine</HI> which is made Red, continues &s;o. 'Tis either <HI>1&s;t,</HI> of an indifferent Con&s;i&s;tence and Tran|&s;parent, and then it owes its Colour to <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> more than ordinarily adu&s;t and there|fore plentifully incocted in the <HI>Serum.</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>2dly,</HI> Such an <HI>Urine</HI> is Red, as al&s;o Dark and Muddy and be&s;ides what particles of <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> it hath, &s;ome earthy Particles are emboyl'd in it, which &s;ticking in the Pores and Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Urine,</HI> do not all precipitate; be|cau&s;e the Liquor of the <HI>Urine</HI> dive&s;ted of its fit Spirits, which wou'd &s;eparate and precipitate all parts of a different di&s;po&s;ition, as it u&s;ually happens in Wine that hath lo&s;t its Head, or been &s;ower'd by Thunder; in which Ca&s;e, the Liquor is impre|gnated with thick and muddy Dreggs, and for want of due Spirits cannot finally clarify and be|come limpid as before.</P>
<P>Hence &s;uch <HI>Urine</HI> is the wor&s;t of &s;igns in <HI>Fea|vers;</HI> becau&s;e it &s;ignifies &s;uch a confu&s;ion of a|du&s;t matter in the Blood, that ought to be &s;epa|rated, and yet the Vital Spirits cannot bring it un|der and overcome it. The <HI>Urine</HI> is &s;ometimes made Red, becau&s;e of its Contents, which falling to the bottom, the Liquor becomes of another Colour</P>
<PB N="30" REF="41">
<P>Now this, as 'tis &s;aid above, is two-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ometimes thin, which is the matter or remaind|er of the adu&s;t Recrements from the deflagration of the Blood: Sometimes thick, <HI>viz.</HI> from the de|generate Particles of the Nutritive Juice; both the&s;e being torrify'd by the Blood's Ebullition and being &s;eparated, are partly &s;ent out by Sweat, and partly mix'd with the <HI>Serum,</HI> who&s;e Con&s;i|&s;tence they thicken, and enhance its Colour, to wit, as long as tho&s;e Contents are held up, be|ing enclos'd in the Pores and Pa&s;&s;ages of the Li|quor, the Colour appears more deep, and the Con|&s;i&s;tence more thick; but the&s;e being fallen to the bottom, the Redne&s;s and Thickne&s;s of the Liquor are abated: The rea&s;on of both which &s;hall be a&s;&s;ign'd hereafter, when we a&s;&s;ert the Cau&s;es of Clearne&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and other Colours of <HI>Urines.</HI> Now let's enquire What's the Rea&s;on of the dif|ference, that Red <HI>Urines</HI> are wont to be made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Feavers,</HI> the <HI>Scurvy, Con&s;umptions,</HI> and per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">aps in other Affects.</P>

<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> In an inveterate <HI>Scurvy,</HI> the <HI>Urine</HI> is often &s;o high colour'd, that 'tis not exceeded in a violent burning <HI>Feaver,</HI> which (if evaporated or di&s;till'd) yields plenty of <HI>Salt</HI> with &s;limy Dreggs, wherefore it &s;eems evident by this Experiment. that this high Colour, owes its original to <HI>Salt</HI> Principles, as was hinted before; becau&s;e in <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Ca&s;es, tho&s;e <HI>Salt</HI> Particles, which ought to be Volatiliz'd, and &s;ent forth by a con|&s;tant Tran&s;piration, are fix'd and re&s;train'd from their u&s;ual Motion, and therefore are more plen|tifully heap'd up in the affected Body. This <HI>Salt</HI> (afore-&s;aid) remaining within, with <HI>Sulphur</HI> and Earth, is diver&s;ly coagulated, and then plen|tifully re&s;olv'd. And from this different Coagu|lation and Re-di&s;&s;olution, follows wonderful Symptoms of this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e from the&s;e <HI>Saline</HI> Particles, plenti|fully di&s;&s;olv'd with &s;ome <HI>Tartarous</HI> Dreggs, and diluted with the <HI>Serum, Urines</HI> become tin|ctur'd with adeep and high Red. Be&s;ides in this Affect, when inveterate, the cour&s;e and pa&s;|&s;ages
<PB N="32" REF="43">of the Liver and <HI>Ve&s;icula Fellis</HI> being ob|&s;tructed and deprav'd, they perform their Of|fice wor&s;e, in &s;eparating the adu&s;t Particles of Blood from the re&s;t of the Ma&s;s, which being plentifully loaded with it, and di&s;&s;olv'd in the <HI>Serum,</HI> do the more dye it with a Lie-like Tin|cure. And if tho&s;e Particles of adu&s;t <HI>Sulphur,</HI> over-ballance tho&s;e of a fix'd and <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Salt, the <HI>Jaundi&s;e</HI> is in complication with the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> and the <HI>Urine</HI> then dyes Linnen with a Saffron-colour.</P>
<P>But if they be exceeded by the <HI>Saline</HI> Particles, only a <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Affect is produc'd, in which the <HI>Urine</HI> is highly red; but yet will not make yellow Linnen. That 'tis thus, it is highly probable; for, in Di&s;&s;ecting many of tho&s;e, who had frequently made red <HI>Urine</HI> and dy'd of the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> it has has been ob&s;erv'd, that their Liver or the <HI>Ve&s;icu+<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> Fellis</HI> was greatly in fault: In &s;ome, the Li|ver hath appear'd wholly bloodle&s;s and dry'd like a Cow's Udder: In others, the <HI>Ve&s;icula Fel|lis</HI> was quite empty: In &s;ome ob&s;tructed with little Stones: In others again, fill'd with Mo|thery Dreggs, nor at all bitter: but in all tho&s;e that were &s;o affected, a &s;eparation of the Gall was hinder'd.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> by rea&s;on of <HI>Salt</HI> &s;o di&s;&s;olv'd, the <HI>Urines</HI> are &s;ometimes Red in <HI>Gouty</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es for be&s;ides the <HI>Arthritik</HI> Fits (in which &s;uch <HI>Urine</HI> is of|ten made) I have ob&s;erv'd, in &s;ome very pain|&s;al Affects, imitating, in a manner, a <HI>Feaver,</HI> with a deep red <HI>Urine,</HI> wandring Pains, &s;ome|times raging in this, &s;ometimes in that Part; &s;o
<PB N="33" REF="44">that the afficted Patient could &s;carce &s;tand upon his Feet, or move a Member; troubled al&s;o with Watchings and frequent Sweats, and like|wi&s;e with Thir&s;t, great dryne&s;s of the Jaws, the <HI>Urine</HI> very red, with a plentiful Sediment; yet in the interim, 'twas not evident, that there was any great Ebullition in the Blood, that the Pati|ent was under any great Languor of Spirits, or <HI>Head-ach,</HI> whereupon I &s;u&s;pected this Affect was e&s;pecially from the <HI>genus Nervo&s;um,</HI> chiefly de|pending upon the Exorbitances of a Saline, rather than a Sulphureous Principle.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4ly,</HI> Likewi&s;e the <HI>Urine</HI> is Red in a confirm'd <HI>Con&s;umption,</HI> e&s;pecially if a <HI>Hectick</HI> (as 'tis ge|nerally) be join'd with it. The rea&s;on of which is, if at any time an <HI>Ulcer</HI> has &s;eiz'd the <HI>Lungs;</HI> from thence, a putrid Matter being mix'd with the Blood in it's Circulation, cau&s;es almo&s;t a con|tinual Ebullition; whereby the <HI>Sulphureous</HI> and <HI>Saline</HI> Particles, being more plentifully di&s;&s;olv'd and incocted in the <HI>Serum,</HI> render its Liquor Red: Be&s;ides, by rea&s;on the Blood is thus con|taminated, almo&s;t all the Nutritive Juice dege|nerates into Putrefaction, and with tho&s;e Recre|ments the <HI>Urine</HI> being impregnated, grows more Red, and is plentifully &s;tu&s;&s; d with its Contents. An evidence of which is, that <HI>Con&s;umptive</HI> Per|&s;ons are for the mo&s;t part, hot after Meat, their whole Body being put into a <HI>Feaveri&s;h</HI>-heat, which is &s;ucceeded by <HI>Nocturnal</HI> Sweats. More|over, there is in the <HI>Urines</HI> a thick and plenti|ful Sediment, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Nutritive Juice being mix'd with the
<PB N="34" REF="45">Blood, and not rightly a&s;&s;imilated, cau&s;eth an Ebullition in it, and degenerating into &s;ome &s;trange Matter, is partly driven through the Skin, partly tran&s;mitted by <HI>Urine,</HI> and partly aug|ments its Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Hitherto have we Treated of Red <HI>Urines;</HI> and every kind of 'em now hinted at, have many De|grees of inten&s;ion and remi&s;&s;ion; for as the Cau&s;es change in them, &s;o in the Colour and Con&s;i|&s;tence they are either weaker or &s;tronger.</P>
<P>As for Green or Black <HI>Urine,</HI> I confe&s;s, I ne|ver &s;aw any that was either exactly green as Leeks, or black as Ink. But I think, from a very high yellow, with a dark or &s;omewhat Inky mixture, the appearances of greeni&s;h or blacki&s;h <HI>Urine</HI> may ari&s;e, which Authors u&s;ually call green or black <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
<P>But tho&s;e <HI>Urines</HI> which are thus colour'd, do either con&s;tantly remain in the &s;ame &s;tate for &s;ome time, and are &s;igns of the <HI>Black-Jaundi&s;e,</HI> or the Blood affected with &s;ome Virulency; or the <HI>Urines</HI> are occa&s;ionally diver&s;ly chang'd, and are &s;ometimes of that, and &s;ometimes pre&s;ently of another Colour; &s;o that I have known <HI>Hypo|condriacal</HI> Per&s;ons wont fir&s;t to make &s;uch <HI>Urines,</HI> and then a little after, like tho&s;e of &s;ound Per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the former, when the <HI>Jaundi&s;e</HI> grows very high, &s;o that the adu&s;t portion of <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Salt</HI> have a longer continuance in the Ma&s;s of Blood, the&s;e &s;ame by long incoction, acquire a Colour more deep than yellow; <HI>viz.</HI> at fir&s;t Greeni&s;h, and then afterwards &s;omewhat Black,
<PB N="35" REF="46">with which the <HI>Serum</HI> is in like manner tin|ctur'd. For if yellow Gall be taken out of the <HI>Ve&s;icula Fellis,</HI> and put into a Bolt-head, and expos'd to the gentle heat of a warm Bath, it waxes &s;hortly green, and afterwards by continu|ance will appear almo&s;t as black as Ink. Where|fore in the <HI>Black-Jaundi&s;e,</HI> which is only the Yellow, by longer continuance advanc'd into a greater degeneracy, there's nothing more u&s;ual than an Inky-<HI>Urine.</HI></P>
<P>Further, &s;uch <HI>Urines</HI> &s;ometimes appear in a malignant <HI>Feaver</HI> and the <HI>Plague,</HI> as al&s;o fre|quently after the drinking of Poy&s;on, and in the&s;e Ca&s;es, are commonly a deadly Sign; be|cau&s;e they argue the Blood much corrupted, and as 'twere mortify'd, the Spirits being vanqui&s;h'd, and the bond of mixture loos'd, ju&s;t as when a part in our Bodies is Ulcerated, and afterwards perverted into a <HI>Gangrene</HI> or Mortification, pre|&s;ently the Pi&s;s, which before was wateri&s;h, white or yellow, becomes black. Wherefore in the afore&s;aid Affects, when the <HI>Urine</HI> grows black, the <HI>Serum</HI> and Blood being wholly vitia|ted, the outward Skin is likewi&s;e darkned with &s;uch a Colour.</P>
<P><HI>Urines</HI> that are tinctur'd with a greeni&s;h, or e&s;pecially a black Colour, at certain times which often happens to <HI>Hypocondriacks</HI>) very likely proceed from the Dregs of the <HI>Bilis atra,</HI> or the black Choler entrea&s;ur'd in the <HI>Spleen;</HI> and then through too plentiful conge&s;tion, over|flowing at &s;ometimes, mix with the Ma&s;s of Blood: For &s;uch Matter being often effunded in|to
<PB N="36" REF="47">the Stomachs of &s;ome Men, produces greeni&s;h or inky Vomits: As likewi&s;e in others, the &s;ame Matter being &s;uck'd up by the Blood, in its Cir|culation, may tincture the <HI>Urine</HI> with &s;uch like Colours.</P>
<P>Hitherto have we &s;poken of the Colours of <HI>Urines:</HI> Tho&s;e that are Pale, proceed from too much Crudity; almo&s;t all tho&s;e that are High|colour'd, ari&s;e either from <HI>Salt</HI> or <HI>Sulphur</HI> too plentifully di&s;&s;olv'd, and &s;ometimes, from the adu&s;t Recrements throughly incocted in the <HI>Se|rum;</HI> or from the more cra&s;s Contents of the <HI>Urine,</HI> whether they be the very <HI>Calx</HI> and re|mainder of the Aliment degenerated in Con|coction, or the Liquations and mouldrings of the Con&s;umptive Body, or &s;ome ill-affected Part thereof; which expre&s;&s;ions will be better under|&s;tood, if we explain the manner, how &s;uch-like Di&s;&s;olutions and Contents may diver&s;ly change the Colour of <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
<P>The Cau&s;es of different Appearances and changeable Colours, as al&s;o of Darkne&s;s and Tran&s;parency in <HI>Urines</HI> (as in other Liquors) depend wholly on the different immi&s;&s;ion and emmi&s;&s;ion of the Rays of Light.</P>
<P>For, if the body of the Liquor be thin, with open Pores and Pa&s;&s;ages, that the Rays of Light may be ea&s;ily tran&s;mitted, 'tis then Tran&s;pa|rent and Clear, like Fountain-water: But if the Pores of the Liquor be &s;tuff'd with Contents, or little Bodies &s;wimming in it, &s;o that the illu|minating Rays be refracted and broken in the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, at la&s;t when they appear accord|ing
<PB N="37" REF="48">to the different Modes of Refraction and Re|flection, in the (as yet) diaphanous Liquor, the Colour will appear either Citron, Saffron, or Red.</P>
<P>But if the &s;paces of the Pores, be yet more po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd, &s;o that the Light be not at all tran&s;mit|ted, from thence Darkne&s;s will proceed: But then if the Rays once receiv'd, be but little or not at all reflected, the Liquor will appear of a dusky or blacki&s;h Colour. But if they be Re|flected according to the different modes of Re|flection, the appearance will be White, A&s;he|colour'd, or of another kind; upon this Suppo|&s;ition, that as the Liquor of the <HI>Urine</HI> is &s;ome|times in a manner, almo&s;t devoid of <HI>Salt, Sul|phur,</HI> and other Di&s;&s;olvables, it ea&s;ily tran&s;mits the Light. Sometimes being moderately, or much &s;tuft'd with &s;uch-like Contents, it either di&s;torts the incident Rays in their pa&s;&s;age, or wholly im|bibes them, or la&s;tly reflects them: So that from hence, 'tis ea&s;y to unfold all the <HI>Phaenomenons</HI> of Colours and Con&s;i&s;tence in <HI>Urines.</HI></P>
<P>It happens frequently, that the Colour of the &s;ame <HI>Urine</HI> is much chang'd; for that which is made Red, being expos'd to the Air, becomes White or of a Darki&s;h-colour, and then a lit|tle time after of a Citron colour; the rea&s;on of which appearance &s;eems to be this:</P>
<P>This <HI>Urine</HI> when made is red, becau&s;e the Pores of the Liquor are much po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Contents: Yet as long as tho&s;e Pores are kept open by Heat, they tran&s;mit the Rays of Light in &s;uch manner (tho' diver&s;ly di&s;torted) that they by way of Reflection, rebound again.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="49">
<P>But this <HI>Urine,</HI> is no &s;ooner expos'd to the cold Air, but the Pores being &s;hut up, the po&s;i|tion of Parts are chang'd in the Contents, and therefore the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Rays of Light is hinder'd, wherefore the Liquor becomes pre&s;ently dark, and as tho&s;e Rays are reflected this or that way, the Colour becomes white, dusky, or &s;ome other Colour. But at la&s;t the Contents, by their weight, falling to the bottom, the Pores being freed, ea&s;ily tran&s;mit the Rays of Light, and do le&s;s di&s;tort them; wherefore the Colour appears not high, but Citron.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid concerning the Co|lour of <HI>Urines,</HI> it may appear what's the Cau&s;es of the different Con&s;i&s;tence of <HI>Urines:</HI> For as the Particles of <HI>Salt, Sulphur,</HI> or adu&s;t Matter, or the Nutritive Juice depriv'd of a right A&s;&s;imi|lation, are more or le&s;s incocted in the <HI>Se|rum,</HI> the <HI>Urines</HI> become more or le&s;s Thick or Thin in their Con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In the next place it remains, we &s;peak of the Preternatural Contents in <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Concerning the Contents in the <HI>Urines</HI> of the Sick.</HEAD>
<P>WE acknowledge the Contents to be two|fold, in the <HI>Urine</HI> of the Sick, <HI>viz.</HI> Ei|ther <HI>Univer&s;al,</HI> which proceed from the Ma&s;s of
<PB N="39" REF="50">Blood and <HI>&s;uccus Nervo&s;us,</HI> and re&s;pect the Ha|bit of the whole Body: Or Particular, which are the Excrements and refu&s;e of &s;ome Bowel or Part ill-affected; concerning which, by and by.</P>
<P>The&s;e of the former kind, which proceed from the Habit of the whole Body, are either Natu|ral, to wit, the Filaments making up the <HI>Nube|cula</HI> or Urine-cloud, as in &s;ound Per&s;ons: Or Preternatural, which e&s;pecially are the Parti|cles of the Nutritive Juice degenerated in A&s;&s;imi|lation, making up tho&s;e more cra&s;s Bodies of the Sediments in <HI>Urines.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly (in a <HI>Feaver</HI>) &s;ome adu&s;t Matter from the Inflammation of the Blood, diluted with the <HI>Serum,</HI> is added, which augments the black|ne&s;s of the Contents.</P>
<P>But the&s;e, as well Natural as Preternatural Contents of <HI>Urines,</HI> are very different, as the Blood is more or le&s;s di&s;orderly or unduly fer|mented.</P>
<P>And likewi&s;e, as the Aliment in the Bowels and Ve&s;&s;els is diver&s;ly concocted; and either the &s;uperfluities or refu&s;e of the Chyle, which is made thence, are wa&s;h'd off with the <HI>Serum:</HI> And if the Nutritive Juice &s;ent to the Blood, be not wholly perverted, but a great part chang'd into Nouri&s;hment, for the augmentation of the &s;olid parts; then likewi&s;e a part of this being mix'd with the <HI>Serum,</HI> leaves &s;ome foot-&s;teps of an Urine-cloud. And if that Preternatural Se|diment, which is made up of a degenerate or a|du&s;t Matter, be yet but little and thin, it doth not, as yet, wholly obliterate the appearance of this, which is Natural.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="51">
<P>Hence, in the beginning and declen&s;ion of <HI>Feavers,</HI> and &s;ometimes in a <HI>Con&s;umption,</HI> or in a <HI>Cachexia</HI> or an ill Habit of Body, the <HI>Nube|cula,</HI> or Urine-cloud is &s;een, tho' not &s;o perfect. But if the greater part of the Chyle, boiling with the Blood, through its immoderate heat, be perverted into an heterogeneal Matter, which afterwards, as hurtful and unprofitable, is &s;ent out with the <HI>Serum,</HI> the Urine-cloud forthwith becomes ob&s;cure and imperfect: Al&s;o be&s;ides that, there are many Contents in the <HI>Urines</HI> which enhance their Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Urine</HI> which has in it a Urine-cloud, tho' imperfect, if it be kept in a hot place, the <HI>Nube|cula</HI> only is vi&s;ible, and the re&s;t of the Contents, being kept in the Pores of the <HI>Urine,</HI> while en|larg'd by Heat, become utterly invi&s;ible; not|with&s;tanding the &s;ame Contents (the little &s;paces of the Pores being &s;traitned by Cold) are preci|pitated, and thereupon changing their place and &s;ituation, rendet the <HI>Urine</HI> dark and trou|bled, obliterating the appearance of the Urine|cloud. Such <HI>Urines</HI> are commonly made in the better &s;tate of <HI>Feavers,</HI> a <HI>Catarrh, Cough,</HI> want of Tran&s;piration, a <HI>Caccchymia</HI> (or the abun|dance of Ill-humours in the Blood) and in mo&s;t of the higher &s;ort of <HI>Dy&s;crafies, i. e,</HI> evil Com|plexion or Temperature.</P>
<P>But if the Sickne&s;s be &s;o far advanc'd, that the Concoction and Nutritive Juice be wholly chang'd into Putrefaction, &s;uch like, are plainly vi&s;ible in the <HI>Urine,</HI> and that without the ap|pearance of an Urine cloud, and do &s;ignify a great
<PB N="41" REF="52">diver&s;ity in Di&s;ea&s;es, as they are precipitated di|vers ways, and make a Sediment of divers kinds, as there is a &s;udden, &s;low, or no Separation at all of Parts, and as the Matter falling is Little or Much; White, Red, or Dusky: I &s;hall briefly run through all the material or chief Ob|&s;ervations concerning this Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, Urine</HI> Impregnated with &s;uch Contents, &s;ometimes is not precipitated at all, (unle&s;s it be after a long time, the body of the Liquor dissolv|ing by Putrefaction) but remains a long time troubled and &s;omewhat dark, the little Bodies floating all over it. The rea&s;on of this is, either becau&s;e the&s;e Contents are too deeply incocted in the <HI>Serum,</HI> &s;o that the Innate Spirits cannot &s;eperate the Pure from the Impure, the Thick from the Thin; as is &s;een in the Brewing of Beer, in which if too much of the Mealy-part of the Malt be commixt, the Liquor will &s;carce ever after become Clear: Or likewi&s;e the <HI>Urine</HI> re|mains troubled, becau&s;e 'tis utterly de&s;titute of Spirits which might ferment the parts of the Li|quor; as 'tis wont to happen in Beer that grows &s;our by rea&s;on of Thunder, or immoderate Heat, and being loaded with muddy Dreggs, is &s;eldom or ever, rightly depurated again. Such like <HI>Urine</HI> in <HI>Feavers,</HI> is for the mo&s;t part, very dangerous: Sometimes al&s;o it denotes an irreco|verable <HI>Cachexia,</HI> and always intimates a very ill Sign.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> It &s;ometimes happens that the <HI>Urine</HI> is &s;o impregnated with Contents, that they begin to precipitate while it's yet hot. I have often
<PB N="42" REF="53">ob&s;erv'd it thus in a lingring <HI>Feaver,</HI> where the Heat is more mild and remi&s;s, in which, the Particles of the Thick Nouri&s;hment are deprav'd, and being le&s;s conquer'd by that Heat, or le&s;s incocted in the <HI>Serum,</HI> do more ea&s;ily fall from its Pores; like as when common <HI>Sulphur</HI> is boyl'd in a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> if it be remov'd from the Fire before a perfect di&s;&s;olution, the Liquor that is at fir&s;t clear and red, becau&s;e of the &s;udden pre|capitation of the di&s;&s;olv'd Contents, forthwith becomes turbid, ob&s;cure, and of a whiti&s;h co|lour.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> What u&s;ually happens: The <HI>Urine</HI> be|ing much impregnated with &s;uch like Contents, as long as 'tis hot, and &s;ometime after, appears clear and tran&s;parent; but when it grows cold by degrees, it waxeth turbid, and (as if &s;ome in|fus'd <HI>Coagulum,</HI> or curdling Matter had mix'd with all its parts) is precipitated, which not|with&s;tanding, if it be kept at the Fire, or in a hot place, grows clear again. The rea&s;on of which, is &s;ufficiently Explain'd before, where we &s;poke of the Cau&s;es of Darkne&s;s and Tran&s;pa|rency.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> After the <HI>Urine</HI> expos'd to cold is preci|pitated in manner afore&s;aid, it may be ob&s;erv'd how its Contents fall to the bottom. For &s;ome|times they fall in a &s;hort time, and if in the &s;pace of two or three Hours the Liquor grows clear, 'tis a Sign the <HI>Urine</HI> is not &s;tuff'd, nor much im|pregnated with <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur;</HI> hence in the beginning and declen&s;ion of <HI>Feavers,</HI> when the Heat is remi&s;s, &s;uch <HI>Urine</HI> is often made. Some|times,
<PB N="43" REF="54">except in the &s;pace of many Days, &s;uch a &s;ub&s;idence of Contents will not en&s;ue; becau&s;e the con&s;i&s;tence of the <HI>Urine</HI> is thicker than it ought to be; therefore it cannot let go its Con|tents out of its embraces &s;o ea&s;ily, that by their gravity they may find the bottom.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Urines</HI> are generally made in the &s;tate of <HI>Feavers,</HI> and are the fore-runners of an ill <HI>Cri&s;is.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>5thly,</HI> The Sediments which fall to the bot|tom, are not le&s;s differing; in this place, pa&s;&s;ing by Corruption and Blood, Sand and Gravel, and certain other depo&s;ited parts.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e that are the products of the whole Body, are for the mo&s;t part white, dusky or like red <HI>Oker.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Urine,</HI> after it has &s;tood long, be filter'd through Cap-paper, &s;uch Contents are retain'd, and may be plainly examin'd. I have often &s;een white Sediments like <HI>Chalk;</HI> &s;ometimes red, like <HI>Armenian</HI> Bole, and without doubt, the matter of all is the &s;ame; <HI>viz.</HI> the Recrements of the Blood after its Inflamation, and the Nu|tritive Juice deprav'd in A&s;&s;imilation, which as they are concocted in our Bodies by Heat and di|ver&s;ly perverted, they appear likewi&s;e in <HI>Urine,</HI> under a different Colour and Form. As <HI>Anti|mony</HI> mix'd with <HI>Nitre,</HI> and more or le&s;s Cal|cin'd, produceth a <HI>Calx</HI> &s;ometimes red, &s;ome|times Saffron-colour'd, &s;ometimes yellow and &s;ometimes dusky.</P>
<P>The like Rea&s;on, as it &s;eems, may be render'd concerning the Sediments of <HI>Urines,</HI> which are,
<PB N="44" REF="55">as 'twere the <HI>Calx</HI> of a Sulphureous and Terre|&s;trial Matter over-burnt by the heat of a <HI>Feaver</HI> in the Bowels and Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6thly,</HI> Be&s;ides &s;uch u&s;ual Contents in the <HI>&V;|rine</HI> of the Sick, I have often ob&s;erv'd, that af|ter the <HI>&V;rine</HI> had &s;tood &s;ometime in a Chamber|pot, &s;ome Sand-like Matter cleav'd to the &s;ides thereof, and that under a different figure; For &s;ometimes the&s;e little Bodies are like Sands with a rough and unequal Surface.</P>
<P>Sometimes they grow together with ridge and furrow like the Chry&s;tals of <HI>Nitre,</HI> and are &s;plen|dent and gli&s;tring like Ice; &s;ometimes I have &s;een &s;uch-like Chry&s;tals &s;tick to the &s;ides of the Pot, from tho&s;e who had labour'd under a <HI>Dy|&s;enteria</HI> or <HI>Bloody-flux.</HI> Sometimes in <HI>Urines,</HI> when they have &s;tood a while, there appears a Scumm &s;wimming at top, ju&s;t like <HI>Tartar,</HI> when boyl'd in Water. That whiti&s;h Cru&s;t, coagula|ted in the &s;urface of the <HI>Urine,</HI> is commonly be|liev'd to be both Fat and Oily, and is accounted a Liquation or melting away of the &s;olid Parts; tho&s;e therefore, who make this <HI>Urine,</HI> are pre|&s;ently pronounc'd Con&s;umptive and very deplo|rable.</P>
<P>But this Concretion is only <HI>Saline,</HI> and be|ing expos'd to the Fire, is not at all di&s;&s;olva|ble, but is condens'd into a cru&s;ty Sub&s;tance. Moreover, both the&s;e and the re&s;t of the Incru|&s;tations of <HI>Urines,</HI> are a kind of <HI>Tartar,</HI> pro|duc'd in them by a certain coagulation. Such a Concretion wholly depends on the Particles of a fluid and acid <HI>Salt,</HI> combin'd with tho&s;e of a fixt or Alkaliz'd <HI>Salt.</HI></P>
<PB N="45" REF="56">
<P>For, in any Subject, where this commixture of <HI>Salts</HI> of both kinds doth happen, whether pro|duc'd Naturally, or by Artificial Operation, there en&s;ue diver&s;e kinds of Coagulations and Chry&s;tal|lizations.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;uch kind of <HI>Urine,</HI> on which there &s;wims a <HI>Tartar</HI>-like Scum, or in which, Cry&s;tals cleave to the &s;ide of the Pot or Urinal, &s;hew that the Blood is degenerated from its Sweet Bal&s;amick Nature (&s;uch as is the re&s;ult of <HI>Salt</HI> Volatiliz'd) into an Acid and Corro&s;ive Tem|per, and the fludity and fixation of a <HI>Saline</HI> Prin|ciple: Such <HI>Urine,</HI> if evaporated, leaves great &s;tore of <HI>Salt</HI> in the bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el. The Af|fects of which, as 'tis often ob&s;ervable (as I have experienc'd) are &s;pitting of Blood, an <HI>A|trophy</HI> and an <HI>Hypocondriacal</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition. 'Tis worthy Ob&s;ervation, Whether the <HI>&V;rines</HI> of Sick Per&s;ons, give a Tincture to the Chamber-pot, or not; for &s;ometimes in <HI>Feavers,</HI> the <HI>&V;rine</HI> is no &s;ooner put into a Gla&s;s, but pre&s;ently it darkens its &s;ides with a whiti&s;h-cloud, yet, at an|other time, 'twill not happen &s;o. I think, the rea|&s;on of that &s;ully'd dye on the Gla&s;s, is, becau&s;e the <HI>Urine</HI> is more impregnated with a di&s;&s;olv'd <HI>Sulphur,</HI> than its Pores can contain in them. For every Liquor, that is too much impregnated with <HI>Sulphur</HI> doth the &s;ame. As 'tis &s;een in a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> in which common <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Antimo|ny</HI> hath been boil'd.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e every <HI>Urine,</HI> if it &s;tands in a Gla&s;s till it putrefies, it tinctures its &s;ides with a Clou|dyne&s;s, or &s;ome cru&s;ty Matter, &s;ometimes whi|ti&s;h
<PB N="46" REF="57">or red, or &s;ometimes of another Colour. For the Fabrick of the <HI>Urine</HI> being loos'd by Pu|trifaction, the Particles being freed from the bond of mixture, are fa&s;ten'd and adhere to the Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Now further, in the <HI>Urines</HI> of Sick Per|&s;ons, this happens forthwith, becau&s;e the <HI>Sul phar</HI> is more plentifully di&s;&s;olv'd in the <HI>Serum,</HI> than can be contain'd in the Pores.</P>
<P>Now as for the particular Contents of <HI>Urine,</HI> tho&s;e indeed are manifold, and may proceed from divers Places and Parts: Yet very frequent|ly, from Di&s;ea&s;es &s;eated about the Kidneys, Bladder, and Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages; &s;ometimes happening from an <HI>Ulcer</HI> in the Liver, Spleen, Lungs or other Bowels; or becau&s;e &s;ome Pre|ternatural Humours are heap'd up in tho&s;e Places and over-flow, through their Superabundancy; hence &s;ome extraneous or foreign Matter is tran&s;|mitted into the Ma&s;s of Blood and thence into the <HI>Serum;</HI> yet this happens but &s;eldom: For when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>Impo&s;tume</HI> is broke within, for the mo&s;t part, it &s;ends its Matter into the Cavity of the Bo|wels, from which there are no pa&s;&s;ages to the Urinary Conduits.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Ma&s;s of Blood being impregna|ted with Impurities, Nature doth not pre&s;ently endeavour to &s;end them out by <HI>Urine,</HI> but often by Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t, <HI>Expectoration,</HI> throwing out of Pim|ples, Wheals or Tumours, and by other ways of Excretion. 'Tis hence commonly ob&s;erv'd, that other Contents of <HI>Urines</HI> (be&s;ides what we have &s;poken of above) are especially &s;ent from
<PB N="47" REF="58">the Kidneys, or their Appendages. The chief of which are Sand, Stones, Blood, purulent mat|ter, little pieces of Fle&s;h, &s;mall Skins, or mealy Se|diments; which for the mo&s;t part &s;ignifie either &s;ome great <HI>Ulcer,</HI> or the <HI>Stone,</HI> or both together &s;eated beyond the Emulgent Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>'Tis u&s;ual with &s;ome, to pi&s;s little Grains of Sand of a red Colour, in great quantity: Some of tho&s;e are troubled with the Stone in the Kid|nies, and often have tho&s;e <HI>Nephritick</HI> Fits: Yet I have known others void Gravel a long time without Pain, or any other grievous Symptom.</P>
<P>All <HI>Urines,</HI> if they &s;tand long in an earthen glaz'd Ve&s;&s;el, &s;ometimes leave &s;uch a Gravel &s;ticking to the &s;ides or bottom, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vola|tile-&s;alt of <HI>Urine,</HI> is coagulated with the &s;ix'd-&s;alt of the Metal. So when <HI>Sal Armoniacum,</HI> mix'd with the &s;ilings of Steel, <HI>Vitrioline</HI> or Sea-&s;alt, is &s;ublim'd, the elevated Flowers grow eminently red.</P>
<P>Wherefore 'tis probable, that &s;uch-like Red grains of Sand, are produc'd in the Kidneys; be|cau&s;e, the <HI>Volatile Salt</HI> of <HI>Urine,</HI> is coagulated with the dregs of &s;ome Tartarous matter, left about the Meanders or windings of the Reins, and thereupon is that Sandy matter made, which forthwith, is wa&s;ht away by the <HI>Serum,</HI> in its pa&s;&s;age; therefore tho&s;e grains of <HI>Sand,</HI> which are &s;o often made, are not the piece-meal moul|drings of &s;ome greater Stones, (as 'tis Vulgarly believ'd) but the extemporary products of the Blood and <HI>Serum,</HI> while they pa&s;s the Chanels of the Kidneys.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="59">
<P>How Stones are produc'd in the Bladder and Reins, is not the enquiry of this place, fully to di&s;cu&s;s; yet beyond all peradventure, rather by Coagulation, than Ex&s;iccation or Calefaction.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd &s;ome Men afflicted with the Stone in the Bladder, who after they had made Water, were wont with much Labour and Grief to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">void a more than ordinary Vi&s;corus Juice, which was pre&s;ently condens'd into a Scaly mat|ter; the &s;mell of it was like that of a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> and it was of the &s;ame con&s;i&s;tence too, as that evaporated to a Thickne&s;s; which Liquor, when it becomes more cra&s;s, and is expos'd to the cold, forthwith doth concrete into a Saline Cru|&s;tine&s;s.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;er &s;tones pa&s;s the Urinary pa&s;&s;ages, and are ejected with little or no difficulty; but 'tis better, that tho&s;e, that are great, re&s;t quietly in their Dens.</P>
<P>The places in which they are u&s;ually pro|duc'd, are the crooked Pa&s;&s;ages and Winding Meanders of the Reins, from whence tho&s;e that are le&s;s, fall into the Bladder, and if they be not ejected from thence, grow very great.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw many, &s;omewhat large Stones, a|bout the &s;ides of the Bladder, betwixt its mem|branes, &s;hut clo&s;ely up. The&s;e without doubt, while le&s;s, were &s;ent from the Reins and detain'd in the pa&s;&s;ages of the Ureters that creep be|tween the Tunicks of the Bladder, and there by degrees were augmented in bulk. The poor Gentlewoman who was thus troubled, long before her Death, avoided a Membrane thick and
<PB N="49" REF="60">large, fill'd with a <HI>Sandy</HI> Matter, which (as it after appear'd, by Di&s;&s;ection of her Body) was a part of the inner Tunick of her <HI>Bladder,</HI> fretted and broken a&s;under by the <HI>Stones,</HI> that had been &s;hut up there.</P>
<P>'Tis ordinary with tho&s;e who have the <HI>Stone,</HI> to emit both Blood and purulent Matter fre|quently with their <HI>&V;rine;</HI> for the fle&s;hy part of the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> being fretted a&s;under with a <HI>Stone</HI> that is greater than ordinary, and being very rough and unequal, the Mouths of the <HI>Veins</HI> and capillary Ve&s;&s;els are unlock'd, from which, the Blood i&s;&s;uing, tinctures the <HI>&V;rine.</HI></P>
<P>By this means, a Solution of Continuity in the <HI>Reins</HI> is begun, and an <HI>&V;lcer</HI> very frequent|ly follows, whereby Corruption and Matter are mixt with the <HI>Serum,</HI> and make a plentiful and &s;tinking Sediment in the <HI>&V;rine;</HI> after that, a continued <HI>Pus</HI> proceeds from the <HI>&V;lcer,</HI> and large effu&s;ions of Blood, very often follow, and the very Fle&s;h of the Kidneys being corroded and eaten away by degrees, is ca&s;t out by <HI>U|rine.</HI> I remember formerly, an ancient good Woman, who, for a long time. voided Blood in her <HI>&V;rine,</HI> every Day, in great quantity: Moreover &s;he u&s;ually emitted, great plenty of pieces of Fle&s;h, as 'twere little Gobbets, and the fi&s;tulous ends of corroded Ve&s;&s;els, when &s;he mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Water; &s;o that 'twas &s;u&s;pected, one of her Kidneys was quite de&s;troy'd, by this means. Yet afterwards, by a Decoction of <HI>Vulnerary</HI> Herbs, made acid with Spirit of Vitriol, this emi&s;|&s;ion of Blood by <HI>Urine</HI> was &s;topp'd, and the Wo|man
<PB N="50" REF="61">grew &s;ound and liv'd many Years after.</P>
<P>I have heard of another Gentlewoman, who at fir&s;t was wont to void both Blood and cor|rupted Matter, with &s;ome little Membranes, for a long time; but after, that Sanguinary Pi&s;&s;ing cea&s;ing, &s;he made for many Years, a Wateri&s;h <HI>Urine,</HI> with a plentiful Sediment, White and like purulent Matter, falling to the bottom of the Chamber-pot. Afterwards when that Sedi|ment was wanting, a <HI>Feaveri&s;h</HI> Di&s;temper, with wandering Pains here and there, a <HI>Deliquium</HI> and Languor of Strength, and other Ill-natur'd Symptomes en&s;u'd; but when this Patient, was brought into great danger of death, a <HI>Tumour</HI> ri&s;ing in her &s;ide, about the &s;eat of the left Kid|ney, being brought to &s;uppuration, a copious e|ruption of Matter, freed her. Yet the hol|low and &s;inuous <HI>&V;lcer</HI> in that place, &s;weat|ing out a thin Matter, remain'd as long as &s;he Liv'd; which &s;ometimes being heal'd, &s;uddenly broke forth again; after that, in the &s;pace of le&s;s than two Years, this Illu&s;trious Lady, hav|ing labour'd under an <HI>I&s;churia</HI> or a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of <HI>&V;rine,</HI> for the &s;pace of fourteen days, died <HI>Apoplectick:</HI> her Body being open'd, the left Kidney was utterly gone, and in its place grew a Membranous Sub&s;tance, cleaving to the Loyns, enfolding the extremities of the Ureters and o|ther Ve&s;&s;els; yet tho' &s;ome Foot-&s;teps of the Ureter did remain, 'twas without any Orifice into the cavity of its Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Moreover, an <HI>Ichor</HI> or &s;erous Matter &s;weat|ing out of the Orifices of the Emulgent Arteries,
<PB N="51" REF="62">was carried into the outward and &s;inuous <HI>&V;l|cer.</HI></P>
<P>The other <HI>Kidney</HI> was very much ob&s;tructed with a gravelly Matter and little Stones. Be|&s;ides al&s;o, about the top of the Ureter, a Stone was fa&s;tned, about the bigne&s;s of a large Filbert-Nut, and its extremity was adapted for the Pa&s;|&s;age or Cavity of the Ureter, and &s;o firmly, as 'twere, ramm'd into it, that it exactly &s;hut up its Orifice (as in the Nature of a Stopple) and hinder'd all the pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
<P>A corrupted Matter, not only from the <HI>Reins,</HI> but al&s;o from the <HI>Bladder</HI> and Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages, in tho&s;e who are Ulcerated, is depo&s;ited in the <HI>&V;rine:</HI> As al&s;o &s;ometimes, from the genital Ve&s;&s;els, <HI>Glandulae pro&s;tatae,</HI> and from certain lit|tle neighbouring Tubes, corrupted Seed, or &s;ome other purulent Matter, is voided with the <HI>&V;rine.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o, the <HI>Albae Mulrieum fluxiones,</HI> and Men&s;truous Blood mixing with the <HI>Urine,</HI> produce preternatural Sediments in it, which ought therefore to be diligently examin'd, and accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed, from the Purulent and Sanguinary <HI>Urines</HI> afore-mention'd.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Urines</HI> of &s;ick Per&s;ons, white and plen|tiful Contents, made up of very little bodies, which after Settlement, filling the Liquor, a|bove half way, making it white and darki&s;h, while the re&s;t, in the upper region of the Cham|ber-pot, is thin and clear; &s;uch is called a mea|ly Sediment; becau&s;e indeed it re&s;embles Water mixt with Meal; and of this, 'tis doubted, whe|ther
<PB N="52" REF="63">it proceeds from the whole Ma&s;s of Blood, or from the <HI>Urinary</HI> Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that in the <HI>Stone</HI> of the <HI>Blad|der,</HI> &s;uch <HI>Urines</HI> are for the mo&s;t part made, and &s;ometimes al&s;o, becau&s;e a greater <HI>Stone</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;eth the <HI>Reins;</HI> for without &s;ome Affect in the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> &s;uch a Sediment in the <HI>Urine,</HI> is never &s;een; wherefore this, is always accounted an undeniable &s;ign of the <HI>Stone;</HI> and it &s;eems to depend wholly upon &s;ome &s;ort of Juice or curdling Humour heapt about the external parts of the <HI>Stone:</HI> For where a <HI>Stone</HI> is fix'd in the <HI>Reins</HI> or <HI>Bladder,</HI> there the nutritious Humour is perverted from A&s;&s;imilation, and degenerates into a more cra&s;s filthy Sub&s;tance (like the <HI>Ichor</HI> in an I&s;&s;ue, that, by rea&s;on of the Pea lodg'd therein, being changed into thick Matter, is more plen|tifully excerned) and that filthy thick Sub&s;tance being carried off with the <HI>Scrum,</HI> makes up this Sediment of the <HI>&V;rine.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of pa&s;&s;ing Judgment on the <HI>Urines</HI> of the Sick.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto concerning the Anatomy of <HI>Urines,</HI> in which their Elementary and Con&s;titu|tive Principles, together with their chief Acci|dents: to wit, Colour, Con&s;i&s;tence and Con|tents, as well tho&s;e that might be in them Na|turally and E&s;&s;entially, as tho&s;e that are wont Preternaturally to happen to them, by rea&s;on of
<PB N="53" REF="64">the Body being ill-affected. Hence 'tis not very difficult for any to bring this Hypothe&s;is to Practice, and to pa&s;s Judgment upon <HI>&V;rines,</HI> by a right Examination of the Urinal; for by what has been &s;aid, 'tis manife&s;t, of what Parts the Di&s;ea&s;es are di&s;coverable by In&s;pection of <HI>&V;rine,</HI> and what the <HI>&V;rine</HI> &s;ignifies in every Particular of them. Concerning this Subject, &s;ome Au|thors have &s;ufficiently Treated; wherefore I &s;hall pa&s;s over this Matter more briefly.</P>
<P>Although the principal Matter of the <HI>Urine, viz.</HI> the <HI>Serum,</HI> doth pa&s;s by every Region of the Body, and Circulates together with the Blood through every part, yet it di&s;covers not the State and Di&s;ea&s;es of them all, but of tho&s;e only to which it owes its natural Perfection and Original, or from which it receives &s;ome Alte|ration; wherefore in &s;ome &s;ort it di&s;covers the Action and Temper of tho&s;e Bowels which &s;erve for Concoction: And be&s;ides, it hints at the Motion and Temper of the Blood and Humours in the Ve&s;&s;els. But that any &s;hould pretend to gue&s;s, and pronounce a Pain in the Head, an <HI>Ul|cer</HI> in the Throat, or any other Affect, of ano|ther Part (from whence nothing is communicated to the <HI>Serum</HI>) by the Urinal only, he will rather &s;ugge&s;t to us, a Symptom of his Ignorance, than one of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Urines</HI> that are brought from &s;ick Per|&s;ons, &s;ometimes perfectly re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Sound, and then they give no light to the Di&s;|ea&s;e, or Part affected. But upon in&s;pection, &s;omething Negatively may be &s;aid, That the Pa|tient
<PB N="54" REF="65">is free from a <HI>Feaver,</HI> and that as to his Stomach and Concoction of Nouri&s;hment, they are not very bad: Wherefore except he be incli|nable to a <HI>Con&s;umption,</HI> or labour under an <HI>&V;l|cer,</HI> or &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e of Solution of Conti|nuity: the Affect whatever it be, is not very dangerous or difficult to Cure. But yet, I would not have him &s;ay any thing ra&s;hly, nor pro|ceed &s;o far, from whence he can have no com|mendable Retreat: For it has &s;ometimes hap|pen'd in the mo&s;t grievous Affects, to wit, in a <HI>Malignant Feaver,</HI> when the Patient lay very dan|gerou&s;ly Sick, his &s;trength greatly dejected, the Pul&s;e weak and unequal, an Eruption of Spots, and other very ill Symptoms accruing, that not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e Accidents, the <HI>Urine</HI> has been laudable, like that of Sound Per&s;ons, as to the Colour, Con&s;i&s;tence and <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is;</HI> &s;o that in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Phy&s;ician having only a &s;ight of the <HI>Urine,</HI> will err gro&s;ly, as to the Progno|&s;tick: Wherefore except other Symptoms coindi|cate, Credit is &s;carcely to be given to the &s;ingle Te&s;timony of the <HI>Urine.</HI> That &s;ometimes it thus happens in the <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Malignant Feavers,</HI> proceeds from this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Blood is corrupted in tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, many times with|out any great Ebullition, and as 'twere &s;ilently; &s;o that although its <HI>Serum</HI> be affected with a cer|tain kind of Coagulation, yet becau&s;e at the &s;ame time, the Blood doth not produce any heap of adu&s;t Matter, by its inten&s;e Inflamma|tion, but is little, or not at all altered from its wonted Cra&s;is or Tenor; hence (I &s;ay) the
<PB N="55" REF="66"><HI>Urine</HI> that &s;ometimes cannot carry with it any &s;uch adu&s;t Recrements, in the mo&s;t dange|rous Affects, becomes a perfect Cheat. Be&s;ides, many times in &s;uch an Inflammation, when the Ebullition of the Blood is very great, whatever Excrementitious Matter is heap'd together in its Ma&s;s, it's pre&s;ently carry'd to the Brain, and <HI>genus Nervo&s;um;</HI> wherefore the <HI>Serum</HI> is u&s;ually freed from Preternatural Contents: Therefore except in the&s;e Ca&s;es, when the <HI>Urines</HI> are high-co|lour'd, Turbid, and without any Sediment, there's no rea&s;on why the <HI>Water-Prophet</HI> &s;hould much &s;tick in making his Progno&s;tick</P>
<P>As often as the <HI>&V;rines</HI> of Sick Per&s;ons, are not like tho&s;e of Sound Men, either &s;omething Natural is Deficient, or &s;omething Preternatural is Superfluous, or both together may happen. Fir&s;t, Colour, Con&s;i&s;tence, Contents, and Quan|tity may be defective; if the Colour be more remi&s;s, than what it ought to be; if very Pale, it di&s;covers Crudity and want of Spiritualizati|on, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e the Nutritive Juice is neither &s;o rightly concocted or exalted in the Bowels and Ve&s;&s;els, that the <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphureous</HI> Particles in Sublimation together, may follow the di&s;tri|bution of the <HI>Serum</HI> (as 'twere in Di&s;tillation) &s;o far as wholly to cleave to it, and tincture it. Wherefore upon the &s;ight of &s;uch an <HI>&V;rine,</HI> thou may'&s;t (and that without folly) gue&s;s at the fol|lowing Symptoms; to wit, that there is an Op|pre&s;&s;ion and Heavine&s;s in the Stomach, want of Appetite, hardne&s;s of Dige&s;tion, Drow&s;ine&s;s, a difficulty of Breathing, frequent Palpitation of
<PB N="56" REF="67">the Heart, (in any Exerci&s;e more than ordinary) a pale Countenance, &s;welling of the Feet and Belly, and that there is danger of falling into (if he is not already in) a <HI>Cachexia,</HI> or el&s;e a <HI>Drop&s;ie;</HI> and if the Per&s;on is one of the Fair Sex, that &s;he is, or will be affected with a de|pravity of Appetite or the <HI>Green-&s;ickne&s;s.</HI> But if in a <HI>Feaver,</HI> the Colour of <HI>Urines</HI> be abated without a Cri&s;is, 'tis a &s;ign that the fermenta|tive Matter, or the adu&s;t Recrements of the Blood are excluded from its reception, and fix'd &s;omewhere el&s;e, which happens for the mo&s;t part in the Brain; and then &s;uch <HI>Urines</HI> com|monly Progno&s;ticate a <HI>Delirium;</HI> or &s;ometimes, a <HI>Pleuri&s;ie:</HI> In <HI>Nephritick</HI> Per&s;ons, a &s;udden al|teration of the <HI>Urine</HI> into a pale-colour, and wa|teri&s;h, fore-tells an approaching Fit of the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>A pale and plentiful <HI>Urine,</HI> often declares a too great di&s;&s;olution of <HI>Salts,</HI> by which Sero&s;ities are &s;ent from the whole Body, and e&s;pecially from the Nervous Parts, as 'twere in a certain Inundation. Such an Excretion is &s;ometimes whole&s;ome, as 'twere Critical, when the Super|fluities happen only to be &s;ent forth; Sometimes Symptomatical, and brings a great Weakne&s;s, becau&s;e then, the Nutritious Juice and other pro|fitable Humours, are &s;ent out together with it.</P>
<P>If the Con&s;i&s;tence be thin, and the Liquor pale, it argues Crudity and want of Spiritualiza|tion; or a Di&s;po&s;ition to a <HI>Nephritick</HI> Parox&s;ym, (as afore-mention'd) or el&s;e, it proceeds from too large a potation of Drink. But if the Colour be flaming, 'tis a &s;ign of an Intermitting, <HI>Tertian.</HI></P>
<PB N="57" REF="68">
<P>If there be no Contents and the <HI>Urine</HI> pale, 'tis a &s;ign of Inconcoction and a Cachectick Affect of the Body; but if the Colour be Citron, and the <HI>Urine</HI> of an indifferent Con&s;i&s;tence without any <HI>Nubecula,</HI> or Urine-cloud, you may &s;u&s;pect the &s;ick Per&s;on to have accu&s;tom'd him&s;elf to too much Excerci&s;e and hard-labour; or is frequently troubled with Nocturnal Sweats; or paradven|ture is in a <HI>Con&s;umption</HI> or inclinable to it.

<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> Something Superfluous is &s;ometimes ad|ded to the <HI>Urine; viz.</HI> The Colour is &s;ometimes augmented, when, in the mean time, the Con|&s;i&s;tence, and Contents are in their due order, and then there's a &s;u&s;picion of a di&s;po&s;ition to a <HI>Fea|ver,</HI> or an <HI>Hectick</HI> begun: Perhaps &s;ome evi|dent Cau&s;e fore-runneth, as great Heat from Bathing, Drunkenne&s;s, or immoderate Exerci&s;e, which might over-heat the Blood; or &s;ome great Cold was unwarily taken, whereupon en&s;u'd a clo&s;ure of the Pores, and con&s;equently want of Tran&s;piration.

<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that the <HI>&V;rine</HI> falls &s;hort of its natural State, yet doth not at all indi|cate the Affect of which the Patient complains, and it either &s;hews the Cau&s;es of the Di&s;ea&s;e, or the con&s;ent of another Part with the affected Part. As if any one &s;hould complain of a violent <HI>Head|ach,</HI> or Trembling of the Heart, and &s;hould make a wateri&s;h <HI>&V;rine,</HI> this doth not denote the very Affects, but only the Crudity of the Stomach, as al&s;o an Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Spleen</HI> and neighbour|ing Bowels, which may be the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Affects.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Concerning the examination of <HI>Urines</HI> and the different manner of Trial.</HEAD>
<P>THO' commonly the Trial and In&s;pection of <HI>Urine</HI> be but &s;imple; <HI>viz.</HI> mo&s;t <HI>Quacks</HI> and <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> immediately after they have put the Water into a Gla&s;s, &s;hake it and then forthwith pa&s;s their Judgment: Yet the matter &s;eems a little more intricate, to tho&s;e who har|tily de&s;ign the Well-fare and Health of the Sick. And concerning this Water-In&s;pection, there are &s;ome ob&s;ervable Circum&s;tances, which if omit|ted, nothing certain, or that may be indeed a Directory in Practice, can be learnt from the <HI>U|rinal.</HI> Moreover in &s;ome Affects, be&s;ides In|&s;pection
<PB N="63" REF="74">of the Gla&s;s, there are other Methods of Trial, by which what is hidden and in the dark in relation to <HI>Urines,</HI> is made manife&s;t; whence &s;ome, who endeavour'd a more accurate Water-judgement, have &s;ucce&s;sfully brought in fa&s;hion, the Evaporation and artificial Precipita|tion of <HI>Urines.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore we will briefly &s;peak of the right manner of <HI>Urine</HI>-in&s;pection, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es, bow they may differently be re&s;olv'd into their fir&s;t Principles.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Urine</HI> of the Sick Per&s;on is offer'd to the Phy&s;ician, if it has &s;tood &s;ometime before in the Gla&s;s, and if the Liquor be Tran&s;parent, the <HI>Nubecula</HI> form'd, and if the re&s;t of the Contents fall to the bottom, there's nothing further wanting, but that forthwith the Progno&s;tick be pronoun|ced. But if the Water be newly pour'd out into the <HI>&V;rinal,</HI> or be before troubled by &s;haking together, you mu&s;t &s;tay till the confus'd parts be again &s;eparated, and recover their due places of Settlement. But if the Liquor being fill'd with Contents, its Pores being &s;hut up with cold, become Turbid and Muddy, let the Gla&s;s be kept in a hot place till the <HI>Urine</HI> clear again, and afterwards let it be plac'd for &s;ome time near the Fire, &s;o long till the preternatural Contents, to wit, either the Thinner be re-imbib'd by the Pores, when enlarged by Heat, or the more Thick fall to the bottom: And if the Filaments which make the <HI>Urine</HI>-cloud (if there be any) be collected together in the Middle Region or a little beneath, then from hence 'twill appear,
<PB N="64" REF="75">what's the Nature of, and what kind of predo|minancy the Di&s;ea&s;e has; and likewi&s;e in <HI>Fea|vers,</HI> the degree of Heat and Effervency, the Concoction of the nutritive Juice, or its De|pravation, as al&s;o the heaping up of Adu&s;t Mat|ter in the Blood, and its Separation begun or wholly fru&s;trated, will al&s;o be &s;omewhat more manife&s;t by intimation from the <HI>Urine:</HI> Where|fore after this manner, mu&s;t you proceed, when <HI>Urine</HI> is brought from far, whole Particles being greatly troubled by &s;uch &s;haking, except they be kept &s;ometime in a hot Place, will not ea&s;ily reco|ver their right Po&s;ition. But if you Vi&s;it the Pati|ent often at his own Hou&s;e, 'twill be convenient that the <HI>&V;rine</HI> newly made be put into an Urinal and plac'd near &s;ome Heat, and while it lei&s;ure|ly grows hot, every Part without any Perturba|tion will be di&s;pos'd of, after the be&s;t manner of Settlement.</P>
<P>After that <HI>Urine</HI> is thus nakedly, and as 'twere without its Vail pre&s;ented to the &s;ight, the next Caution is, lea&s;t that &s;ome of its <HI>Phaenomenons</HI> only accidentally contracted, and not properly belonging to it, impo&s;e upon the Phy&s;ician, which is wont to happen &s;ometimes through di|vers Alterations, proceeding from the Food that's eaten, of which this e&s;pecially con&s;i&s;ts; and then the Colour and Scent are variou&s;ly changed beyond Nature and the Phy&s;ician's expectation. For indeed, there's an Error &s;ufficiently common, when the <HI>Urine,</HI> by <HI>Ruburb, Saffron</HI> or the Seed of <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">vender-Cotton</HI> and other things of the like Tincture&punc; inge&s;ted by the Mouth, growing yel|low,
<PB N="65" REF="76">and giving that dye to Linnen, is thence be|liev'd to be an undoubted &s;ign of the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> Sometimes we likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e, tho' fal&s;ely, that the <HI>&V;rine</HI> &s;hews a <HI>Feaveri&s;h</HI> Di&s;temper when highly tinctur'd wirh a deep Red, by the broth of Pea&s;e, or a decoction of <HI>Madder,</HI> or other Liquids of the like nature.</P>
<P>It often happens, that the high Colour of <HI>&V;|rine,</HI> by a thin &s;mall Liquor copiou&s;ly drank, is abated; and by a &s;tronger Drink and more hot Nouri&s;hment, is rais'd; which accidental Cau&s;es, except a Phy&s;ician know, he is nece&s;&s;ita|ted to pa&s;s a fal&s;e Judgment upon the bare &s;ight of <HI>&V;rine.</HI></P>
<P>When therefore, without any manife&s;t Cau&s;e the Colour of <HI>&V;rines</HI> is chang'd, the manner of Diet mu&s;t be inquired into, &s;o that when the Al|teration proceeds from what's inge&s;ted, it may not ra&s;hly be a&s;crib'd to the Di&s;ea&s;e. A Que&s;ti|on may be rais'd here, Why &s;ince mo&s;t things taken in at the Mouth, before they be tran&s;mu|ted into <HI>Urine,</HI> wholly lo&s;e their innate Co|lours; there are yet &s;ome others, which be|ing eaten, bequeath &s;uch a la&s;ting Tincture to the <HI>Serum,</HI> that they run through the Wind|ings of all the pa&s;&s;ages without any alteration?</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of which, is &s;olely this: Some mixt Bodies have Particles of immutability of Colour, which make up their compo&s;ition &s;o &s;ubtile and exceeding volatile that the&s;e Bodies inge&s;ted, tho' in a 1ittle quantity, colour the whole ma&s;s of <HI>Chyle,</HI> and then the Nutritive Juice, that's convey'd to the Blood, a&s;cends colour'd, and its vehicle, to wit,
<PB N="66" REF="77">the &s;erous Part, is &s;ent out always Tinctur'd.</P>
<P>'Tis obvious to every one, who &s;ometimes &s;mells his own, to know what Scent, &s;ound <HI>U|rines</HI> have: <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e when newly made, the <HI>Sulphureous,</HI> and <HI>Saline</HI> Particles are clo&s;ely bound together in the Liquor, and then 'tis not very ingrate. But when it has &s;tood &s;ometime, &s;o that from the &s;olution of the mixture, the <HI>Sulphur</HI> edg'd with <HI>Salt</HI> begins to exhale, it has a very noi&s;om &s;tinking Scent. Be&s;ides we may ob&s;erve, that <HI>&V;rines</HI> new made &s;ometimes &s;mell &s;weet like <HI>Violets;</HI> and &s;ometimes &s;mell very &s;trong and &s;tinkingly.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, depends neither upon a &s;ound nor un&s;ound State of the Body; but is only produc'd by tho&s;e things that are inge&s;ted. <HI>Turpentine, Nutmegs</HI> and &s;ome other Aromaticks, tho' of a different Nature or Operation, taken inwardly give a &s;weet &s;cent equally alike to the <HI>&V;rine;</HI> where|of this &s;eems to be the rea&s;on: In &s;uch like Bo|dies, very many Particles of a purer <HI>Sulphur</HI> (that is, more Spirituous) have the Predominancy in the mixture, and tho' blended with the <HI>Serum,</HI> cannot be contain'd in it, but forthwith when the <HI>Urine</HI> is made, break their bond of mixture, and tho&s;e alone, not accompany'd with other &s;tink|ing Particles of the <HI>&V;rine,</HI> &s;ally forth, and there|upon diffu&s;e a Scent &s;ufficiently grateful, which tho' it be the re&s;ult of different Inge&s;tibles yet always &s;mells Violet-like; becau&s;e all tho&s;e <HI>Sulphureous</HI> Particles are freed in Dige&s;tion from other adjuncts of the &s;ame concrete Body, neither are they infected with others from the <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
<PB N="67" REF="78">
<P>As for a very ingrate &s;tinking <HI>Urine,</HI> that, &s;ome|times proceeds from an <HI>&V;lcer</HI> about the Kidneys, Bladder, or Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages: Sometimes it likewi&s;e proceeds from a more than ordinary hot Di&s;temperature of the Reins, or the whole Body; for when <HI>Sulphur</HI> is too deeply incocted in the <HI>Serum,</HI> its Particles being edg'd with tho&s;e of <HI>Salt</HI> (becau&s;e le&s;s clo&s;ely combin'd) do forth|with exhale, and very offen&s;ively &s;mite the Or|gans of Smelling. Be&s;ides, <HI>Urine</HI> &s;ometimes has its graveolent or &s;tinking Scent, from what's eaten; for <HI>Garlicky Sparrowgra&s;s,</HI> the Bal&s;om of <HI>Sulphur, Syder, Rheni&s;h</HI>-Wine and many o|ther Inge&s;tibles cau&s;e a &s;tinking <HI>Urine.</HI> If the rea&s;on of the&s;e be requir'd, I an&s;wer, Tho&s;e things that cau&s;e a &s;tinking Scent in <HI>Urine,</HI> like|wi&s;e provoke it in a more plentiful manner; wherefore it appears and is hence demon&s;trable, that the A&s;&s;umption or taking of &s;uch things, precipitates the Blood, and abundantly ha&s;tens the emi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Serum,</HI> and when that, after this manner, is abruptly di&s;-united from the Ma&s;s of Blood, the compage of the Liquor is render'd loo&s;e, neither are the parts exactly mix'd, where|fore the compage of the <HI>Urine</HI> before 'tis &s;ent out of the Body, being thus loos'd and di&s;&s;olv'd, as &s;oon as it is made, the more cra&s;s and <HI>Sul|phureous</HI> Particles (which are link'd together with <HI>Salt</HI>) do pre&s;ently exhale or breath forth, and &s;o diffu&s;e a very ill S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ent: For, the <HI>Urine</HI> that is thus alter'd by what is taken inwardly, &s;eems very like a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> in which <HI>Antimony,</HI> or common <HI>Sulphur</HI> is boyl'd, and an Acid after|wards
<PB N="68" REF="79">in&s;till'd; for in this Decoction, as al&s;o in &s;uch an <HI>Urine,</HI> the compage of the Liquor being de&s;troy'd, the Sulphureous little Bodies break forth and attaque the Organs of Sen&s;ation with a noi&s;ome Savour.</P>
<P>But if any curious Searcher of <HI>Urines,</HI> will go beyond the Trial of Sight and Smell, he may readily by &s;everal Operations, re&s;olve them into their &s;everal Parts, and at 'twere Anatomize them to the Life; and thence deduce Phy&s;ical Directions of great Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>For, in &s;ome Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es, where the ill Contemperaments of the Blood are exactly to be &s;earch'd, that the Proportion and Tempera|ture of the <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> in it, may be right|ly found out, 'twill be convenient &s;ometimes to evaporate or di&s;til the <HI>Urine;,</HI> as al&s;o &s;omething may be learn'd by precipitating or &s;eparating them by Putrifaction. I knew an hone&s;t Woman grievou&s;ly afflicted with a perfect <HI>Lepra</HI> or &s;caly Deformity of her Skin, who u&s;ually every Day &s;crap'd off a great quantity of Bran-like or Scaly Matter; her <HI>&V;rine</HI> being evaporated, left behind it a cru&s;ty <HI>Salt</HI> Sediment, very much like that Excrement of the Skin, &s;ticking to the &s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;el. Formerly I evaporated the <HI>&V;rine</HI> of a Gentlewoman, who was greatly afflicted with Convul&s;ive Motions, and di&s;ten&s;ion of the Mu&s;|cles; the quantity of the <HI>Saline</HI> and <HI>Tartarous</HI> Matter that remain'd in the bottom, did exceed the half of all the Liquor in weight. By the&s;e means it appears, we may ea&s;ily find out the proportion of a <HI>Saline</HI> Principle in the Blood and
<PB N="69" REF="80">Humours. Now whether that <HI>Salt</HI> is volatiliz'd or fix'd above mea&s;ure, the Di&s;tillation of the <HI>Urine,</HI> will manife&s;t. For if the <HI>Spirit</HI> (&s;o call'd) be plentifully exhaled from the <HI>Urine,</HI> and if the <HI>Salt</HI> al&s;o a&s;cends in the Gla&s;s-Alembick, 'tis a vi&s;ible &s;ign of Volatilization; but if the contrary, it argues the fixation of the <HI>Salt.</HI> As the Evaporation and Di&s;tillation of <HI>Urine</HI> &s;hews the power of a <HI>Saline</HI> Principle, &s;o the Precipi|tation and Putrefaction di&s;cover the <HI>Sulphur</HI> and more cra&s;s Contents of <HI>Urines,</HI> as 'twere in Weight and Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As to the Fir&s;t, tho' the <HI>Urine</HI> be a Salt Li|quor, and full of Contents, yet becau&s;e its <HI>Sa|line</HI> Particles, are not (as 'tis u&s;ual in other <HI>Men&s;truums</HI>) either wholly in a &s;tate of Fixati|on or Fluidity, but for the mo&s;t part Volatile, therefore 'tis not pre&s;ently precipitated by the pouring in of any thing that's Salt; the Spirit of <HI>Vitriol</HI> and other Acids do nothing; the <HI>Salt</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> makes a little perturbation; but the Di&s;|&s;olution of <HI>Allom</HI> in it (becau&s;e it very much binds its &s;paces) pre&s;ently and that very much trou|bles the whole Liquor, forcing all the Contents of the Liquor or <HI>&V;rine</HI> out of their places, and renders them vi&s;ible; whereupon by this means, without the tedious proce&s;s of &s;ettling, you may know how much <HI>Sulphureous</HI> and terrene Matter the Ma&s;s of Blood, as its Dregs, imparts to the <HI>Serum.</HI> The putrefaction of <HI>&V;rines</HI> is wont to exhibit every Particle of every kind, yet more di&s;tinct, and as 'twere &s;eparately rang'd.

<P>WHen Judgment is to be pa&s;s'd on <HI>Urine,</HI> it mu&s;t not be &s;hook together, (as <HI>Quacks</HI> generally do) but if it be far brought, or much confus'd any other way, let it forthwith be put into a thin clear Urinal, plac'd in the Sun, or the cleare&s;t Light you can, and then permit it to &s;ub&s;ide for the &s;pace of one at lea&s;t, if not two or three Hours, that its Separation may be
<PB N="71" REF="82">rightly made, and then every part will di&s;tinct|ly appear to view.

<P>Wherefore that you may the more readily De|&s;cant upon this Matter, I &s;hall now de&s;cribe the mo&s;t general Colours, Con&s;i&s;tence, and Contents of the <HI>&V;rines</HI> in mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es, according to the &s;everal A&s;&s;ertions of &s;ome Authors, hereafter mention'd, and which for the mo&s;t part, I have by my own Ob&s;ervation found very true. And if any examine this Matter accurately and right|ly, as it ought, he will undoubtedly find great Satisfaction therein; but according to the com|mon Practi&s;e, from an immediate Coagitation or bare In&s;pection, very little or nothing of the Di&s;ea&s;e can be di&s;cover'd; and con&s;equently, no|thing certain can be pronounc'd: Yet after a di|ligent Examination of every di&s;tinct part of the <HI>&V;rine,</HI> it may then be well &s;hook together, or warm'd upon a Fire, if any de&s;ire to know what Colour it had when newly made.</P>
<P>And where the Patient is Vi&s;ited every Day, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that the Phy&s;ician &s;hould con&s;ult the Chamber-pot, as &s;oon as the <HI>&V;rine</HI> is fir&s;t made (if conveniently it may be) before any Se|paration is begun, that by ob&s;erving the Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence when new made, and well re|membring the Experiments made by the Urinal, he may (from frequent Practi&s;e) gue&s;s in a great mea&s;ure, while the <HI>&V;rine</HI> is hot, at &s;ome of the

<P>That <HI>&V;rine</HI> which comes from the Body thick, muddy and troubled, but becomes afterwards of it &s;elf clear and limpid, is good: For it por|tends the Victory of Nature, &s;eparating things heterogeneous, and expelling that which is inju|rious to her; and that &s;o much the more, if af|ter the &s;eparation, the thicker part &s;ettle in the bottom, white, &s;mooth, and equal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thick Muddy <HI>&V;rine</HI> without &s;eparation.</NOTE>A Thick Muddy <HI>Urine,</HI> which &s;o remains, that being put to the Fire will not clear up, is a very evil and bad Sign.

<P>When the <HI>Urine</HI> is highly tinctur'd with a deep and inten&s;e Red,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red <HI>&V;rine</HI></NOTE> 'tis a certain indication of a <HI>Feaveri&s;h</HI> Di&s;temperature: For it &s;hews an extraordinary heat and inflaming di&s;po&s;ition in

<P>How pernicious tho&s;e Sediments are, will ap|pear by the judgment of <HI>Galen,</HI> of that re&s;em|bling cour&s;e Meal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sediments like cour&s;e Meal.</NOTE> which, as is al|ready declar'd, is not &s;o bad as the re&s;t. <HI>in Com. in Aph.</HI> 31. <HI>Sect.</HI> 7. he thus writes; <HI>&s;uch</HI> Urines <HI>are &s;ometimes mortal, as al&s;o is &s;aid in the Progno&s;t. And many dye in a &s;hort time of Sickne&s;s, but whoever of them e&s;cape&punc; they have a long illne&s;s, the Di&s;po&s;ition requiring a great Concoction, where &s;uch Water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">de. Hippocrates</HI> confirms this, in the fol|lowing Aphori&s;m; <HI>Sediments in</HI> Urines, <HI>made
<PB N="85" REF="96">in the time of</HI> Agues, <HI>like unto cour&s;e Wheat|meal, do &s;ignifie, that the Sickne&s;s &s;hall conti|nue long.</HI> For, they &s;hew a kind of gro&s;s thick humor, which cannot be di&s;&s;olv'd or voided in a &s;hort &s;pace.</P>
<P>It is therefore manife&s;t by the&s;e examples, that whoever they be, that void <HI>&V;rine</HI> like to a thicker &s;ort of Meal, if they may be &s;aved, yet it is long, before they e&s;cape: But whoever they are, that are thus mortally affected, they pe|ri&s;h immediately.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thin Sediment.</NOTE>A Thin Sediment, in the begin|ing of a Di&s;ea&s;e, which in the pro|gre&s;s of the Malady, thickens daily by Degrees, is good. For, it &s;hews that Nature endeavour'd a Concoction at the beginning, and doth daily labour to bring its work to perfection.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thick Sediment.</NOTE>A Thick Sediment, cau&s;ed by thick and crude humors is very bad; for, as tho&s;e thick and crude humours are very hard to be o'recome by Nature, there|fore they do threaten much danger, e&s;peci|ally if the &s;trength of the Body be decay'd; but if there be any &s;trength of Nature, they do only &s;ignifie a prolongation of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e crude and thick humors &s;ettling at the bottom of the Chamber-pot, may deceive a young Practitioner, who may perhaps think them to be a good and true Settlement; and therefore they are to be exactly di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t, tho&s;e crude and thick humours u|&s;ually appear at the beginning of a Di&s;ea&s;e, but the good and true Settlement never till the de|clination
<PB N="86" REF="97">thereof. And it happens, that after the beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e, that thick and crude Humour being attenuated, there appears no more &s;ettlement in the bottom, but only in the place thereof, a Cloud or Matter hanging in the mid|dle or the <HI>Urine,</HI> which as the Concoction pro|ceeds falls down daily from the upper part of the Chamber-pot, to the lower part; which is the true &s;ign of Concoction, when the Cloud changes into that Matter, (which hangs in the middle of the Pot) called <HI>Enaeorema,</HI> and that <HI>Eraeorema</HI> into the Sediment: but on the contra|ry, when the Sediment changes into the <HI>Enaeo|rema</HI> or Cloud, that Settlement is not laudable, but a crude and thick humour which was after|wards attenuated by Concoction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This crude Humour doth not &s;tick clo&s;e together, neither is it altogether &s;mooth and equal: but the laudable Sediment is &s;mooth, equal and moderately thick. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> This crude Humour is heavier and re&s;ides altogether to the bottom of the Chamber-pot; but a good Sediment doth not clo&s;e, but rather re&s;ts in the bottom, be|ing a little rai&s;ed from it, and as it were gather|ed into a kind of Globe, which the crude Hu|mour doth not do, but remains a little more dif|fu&s;ed and &s;cattered.</P>
<P><HI>Urines</HI> in malignant and Pe&s;tilent <HI>Feavers</HI> in Sub&s;tance, Colour and Contents like the <HI>Urine</HI> of found People, are pernicious. For <HI>Hippocrates</HI> &s;aith, Urines <HI>concocted &s;uddenly and without rea|&s;on for it, are evil; and whatever appears con|tained in the</HI> Urine, <HI>not Concocted according to Nature, is wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<PB N="87" REF="98">
<P>I will clo&s;e all in the Words of the ever ho|noured and never to be forgotten Prince of Phy|&s;icians, the great <HI>Hippocrates:</HI></P>
<Q><P>Coctio ex &s;uperioribus &s;ecuritatem Salutis, &amp; celeritatem Cri&s;eos demon&s;trat.</P>
<P>Si ver&ograve; intermi&s;erit, atque interdum mingatur &s;ine Sedimento, &amp; aliqando habeat Sedimentum album, laeve &amp; aequale, morbum diuturnum, &amp; min&ugrave;s &s;ecurum o&s;tendit.</P>
<P>Iterum idem in Coacis praenotionibus &s;cribit. Urina bonum Sedimentum habens, quod derepente evane&s;cit, laborem, mutationemque &s;ignificat.<HI>Item:</HI> Si Urina fuerit &s;ubrubra, &amp; Sedimentum &s;ubrubrum, ac laeve, diuturnior haec quidem e&s;t, qu&agrave;m prior, vald&egrave; tamen &s;alubris.</P>
<P>Qui in &V;rinis celerit&egrave;r Sedimentum habent, celerit&egrave;r judicantur. Ex ii&s;dem Coacis praenot.</P>
<P>Celeriter, id e&s;t, intra paucos dies; nam Uri|na derepent&egrave; cocta, mala judicata fuit.</P></Q>
<P>From hence it appears, That <HI>&V;rine</HI> is be&s;t which hath its Sediment White, Smooth, and E|ven, and doth al&s;o continue &s;o all the while, till perfect Judgment be made of the Di&s;ea&s;e. This well concocted Matter, is a &s;ign of a &s;peedy <HI>Cri|&s;is</HI> and perfect Recovery:</P>
<P>But if it do intermit, and that &s;ometimes the Water be made without any Sediment, it por|tends that the Di&s;ea&s;e will be longer and le&s;s &s;afe. Again, that <HI>Urine</HI> which hath a good Se|diment, if it &s;uddenly di&s;appear, it fore-tells a
<PB N="88" REF="99">great change, and that the Di&s;temper will prove dangerous. Al&s;o if the <HI>Urine</HI> be &s;omewhat Red with a Sediment of the &s;ame Colour and Smooth, &s;uch indeed, is more continual than the former, yet greatly profitable and very healthful; <HI>i. e.</HI> it &s;hews the Di&s;ea&s;e will be of long continuance, but free from danger. Tho&s;e which have a Se|diment in their <HI>Urines,</HI> within a few Days after their Illne&s;s, have Judgment &s;oon made on the Di&s;ea&s;es; for <HI>&V;rines</HI> concocted &s;uddenly are judged very had.</P>
<P>In a Word, as a good &s;ound <HI>&V;rine</HI> ought to be of a middling Sub&s;tance, that is, neither too Thick nor too Thin, of a Citron-colour, or a lit|tle inclining to Red; and tho&s;e other differences that come neare&s;t to this, are to be accounted be&s;t: So likewi&s;e tho&s;e <HI>&V;rines,</HI> which in any degree, appear contrary, either in Sub&s;tance or Colour, are to be adjudg'd naught; of both which, a right Progno&s;tication may be made, by an Accurate <HI>Uro&s;copia</HI> or diligent In&s;pection of the <HI>Urine.</HI></P>
