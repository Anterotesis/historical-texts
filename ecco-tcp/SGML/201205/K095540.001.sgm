<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The Rea&s;ons for Publi&s;hing this Treati&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT may perhaps be wonder'd at, why a Subject of &s;o very nice a Nature as this is, &s;hould here be undertaken, &s;ine in all Manner of Crimes of Impurity and Uncleanne&s;s, Si|lence is generally much more advi&s;eable, than even &s;o much as once to mention them:</P>
<P>And this for fear of putting <HI>That</HI> into any Per&s;on's Mind, which it were much better they cou'd <HI>for ever,</HI> either For|get, or be wholly Ignorant of as long as they live.</P>
<P>But as this Branch of Uncleanne&s;s, <HI>viz. Sinning with a Per&s;on's own Self,</HI> is the mo&s;t general of any Sin of Impuri|ty what&s;oever, by con&s;equence &s;ome In&s;tructions concern|ing it, are the mo&s;t of any wanted in the World, in order to awake the Guilty, and deterr the Innocent and Unwary from falling into it, thro Inadvertence or Ignorance.</P>
<P>There are a great many admirable Treati&s;es extant on the &s;everal other Branches and Sins of Impurity, but very few (if any) really SERIOUS ones upon <HI>This.</HI></P>
<P>Now, why le&s;s &s;hould have been written on <HI>This</HI> one Sin than others, &s;eems to proceed from the Nature of the Crime it &s;elf, and the Difficulty of managing it with &s;uch Prudence and Caution, as neither to omit what is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid, nor to &s;ay any Thing that may &s;eem indecent,</P>
<P>And this is the true Rea&s;on of the Scarceity of Books on this Sin in particular; and yet never was more need of di&s;&s;ua&s;ive In&s;tructions again&s;t it than now, when Debauchery is become &s;o bare-faced, that the generality of Mankind are neither affraid, nor a&s;hamed to glory in it.</P>
<P>So that when People come to this Height of Un|cleanne&s;s, 'tis high time to warn them of their Folly and Danger, le&s;t Almighty God's Anger break in by a &s;udden Death upon them, and there be no e&s;caping.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="15">
<P>Upon Enquiry then, how it comes to pa&s;s, that this mi|&s;erable unhappy Sin of Self-Defilement reigns &s;o in all Places as it does, it mu&s;t be own'd, that one of the chief Rea&s;ons is, the great Scarceity of &s;erious In&s;tructive Books to give A&s;&s;i&s;tance in relation to it.</P>
<P>For certainly, if Per&s;ons did but rightly under&s;tand the Hainou&s;ne&s;s of this Sin, and the convincing Rea&s;ons and Motives there are for refraining from it, it would be much Rarer than it is: But the Mi&s;ery is, Chri&s;tians are not &s;ufficiently informed of this Matter:</P>
<P>Authors that have writ of the Sins of Impurity, have (out of a well de&s;ign'd indeed Mode&s;ty) only treated of this Sin in general: So that there are &s;carce any Books ex|tant, that &s;ufficiently &s;upply the want of In&s;truction about IT in particular: In&s;omuch, that whil&s;t there ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> plen|ty of wicked Books that encourage this abominable Vice, there are hardly any for reclaiming Per&s;ons from it.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation makes it ju&s;tly to be conclude, that a di&s;&s;ua&s;ive Di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t this reigning Sin in parti|cular, cannot fail of being very u&s;eful to the World:</P>
<P>And this more e&s;pecially &s;ince there is no Guilty Per&s;on but had much rather in&s;truct them&s;elves by read|ing a <HI>Book</HI> privately in their Chamber by them&s;elves on this Sin, than they can well bear to hear another &s;peak to them about it, it being a Subject of &s;o very a &s;hocking Nature, that no one Cares either to &s;peak, or be &s;poken to of it.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this is: Becau&s;e altho Per&s;ons may be &s;o far abandoned, as &s;ometimes to make their Brags of other Sins, yet they always dread being known to be Guilty of THIS, it is &s;o very Shameful, Odious and Unnatural.</P>
<P>And therefore in treating this Sin, the Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame, as in treating on other moral Subjects.</P>
<P>For, in handling other Subjects, a Man may &s;afely &s;ay whatever he thinks any ways advantageous to his De&s;ign, and has nothing to hinder him from mentioning what|ever he apprehends nece&s;&s;ary, and propo&s;ing his Arguments in their utmo&s;t Extent and Force, making them as plain as po&s;&s;ible, and an&s;wering all Difficulties relating to them.</P>
<P>But in arguing again&s;t this Sin of Self-Defilement, the &s;ame Liberty is not to be taken; but a Writer is extremely confined, and is obliged to expre&s;s him&s;elf with all. Cir|cum&s;pection and Caution, for fear of intrenching upon Mo|de&s;ty, whil&s;t he endeavours to make him&s;elf under&s;tood.</P>
<P>For which Rea&s;on, whoever treats this Subject, is obli|ged to ab&s;tain from pre&s;&s;ing his Rea&s;onings near &s;o home or from enforcing his Proofs with that Degree of Plain|ne&s;s, they might otherwi&s;e have had.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="16">
<P>And therefore in treating of this particular Branch of Impurity, &s;ome Points might be much more enlarged, and many Objections more particularly con&s;idered:</P>
<P>But then this would nece&s;&s;itate the touching upon &s;ome Things which Decency forbids.</P>
<P>Whatever then Decency commands throughout this Treati&s;e to be mentioned only in general, &s;hall be never|thele&s;s &s;o ordered by Principles that &s;hall be laid down, as to give &s;ufficient room to every attentive (but more par|ticularly every guilty) Reader fully to under&s;tand and them&s;elves &s;upply. And therefore this Subject, how <HI>Dirty</HI> &s;oever it may in it &s;elf be, &s;hall here be wrapt up in the <HI>Clean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> Cloathing that po&s;&s;ibly it can.</P>
<P>To di&s;wade again&s;t an Action that is above others:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> So very Hainous, and Unnatural in its &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> So very abominable and di&s;plea&s;ing before Almighty God: &mdash; And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> So highly pernicious to Per&s;on's Selves and Families, both as to Body and Soul, requires no Arguments which are not entirely agreable to Truth, and can &s;tand the Te&s;t of the &s;tricte&s;t Rea&s;on to the greate&s;t of Libertines, as in the following Chapters will fully appear: &mdash; All which being duly con&s;idered:</P>
<P>It would be very deplorable, if Young and ignorant People &s;hould remain without Warning and A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t &s;o powerful, &s;o treacherous, and dome&s;tick and Ene|my, as the Sin of Self-Defilement is, merely for want of being better in&s;tructed, concerning the Abomination of it.</P>
<P>Youth are in greater Danger of this Sin, than of any other, there being far &s;tronger Incitements and Temptati|ons to it (as being within our &s;elves) than to any other Sin what&s;oever, the Fewel and Treacherous inticement to it always accompanying us wherever we go:</P>
<P>For: Let us change never &s;o much from one Place to another, we always carry our Selves and our own corrupt vicious Inclinations along with us, changing only the Place, but not the Man; and therefore <HI>Horace</HI> ju&s;tly &s;ays, <HI>Caelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who even Pa&s;s the Seas, change only the Climate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut make no more Change to the corrupt Inclinations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he Man, than a Change of mere Cloaths only does; and every one is fully convinced that <HI>Habitus non facit Monachum.</HI></P>
<P>The Occa&s;ions of other Sins may be avoided and run <HI>Away</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rom, but we cannot run <HI>Away</HI> from OUR SELVES:</P>
<P>And therefore 'tis betraying OUR SELVES, that is our greate&s;t Danger, as is admirably, and with an uncommon <HI>Inction,</HI> expre&s;s'd by a late pious Author in the following lymn.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="17">
<LG>
<L><HI>OH my Soul! how many Snares,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lie &s;pread before our Feet?</HI></L>

<L><HI>Le&s;t</HI> WE OUR SELVES <HI>betray.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>For here the main Danger lies in our betraying OUR OWN SELVES, and drawing OUR OWN SELVES into Sin, and therefore with good Rea&s;on every one ought ear|ne&s;tly to beg of Almighty God to &s;ave US from US, that is, OUR SELVES from OUR SELVES:</P>
<P>Man having no greater Enemy again&s;t HIMSELF, than HIMSELF; as our Saviour expre&s;ly tells us. <HI>Math.</HI> chap. 10. v. 36. <HI>Inimici hominis Dome&s;tici ejus.</HI> Every Man's wor&s;t Enemy is from his OWN SELF.</P>
<P>All which makes it a Matter of ju&s;t Lamentation, that a Vice &s;o odious in its Nature, and &s;o pernicious in its Con&s;equences, &s;hould have &s;uch forcible Means to in&s;inuate it &s;elf &s;o far among the flouri&s;hing, (<HI>i. e.</HI> the youthful) Part of Mankind, as to become &s;o general as it is, and no in&s;tructive Books to deter from it extant:</P>
<P>It being almo&s;t certain, that many Delinquents would never have been &s;uch, if they had but had &s;ome good Book to have read on this Subject, that might have informed and in&s;tructed them of, and pointed out to them the Hei|nou&s;ne&s;s of this Sin in particular, and the deplorable Con|&s;equences that follow it, to the Ruin of Body and Po&s;terity in this World, and of Soul in the next.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis hoped, that putting this Book into the World, may prove a prevalent Means to hinder many a one from being fal&s;ly lull'd a &s;leep, and indulging them&s;elves in this abominable Vice, by furni&s;hing them with the &s;tronge&s;t Con&s;iderations how hainous a Crime it is, what terrible Effects follow from it, how it Ba&s;ely defiles every Per&s;on's Body that commits it, Tortures and racks the Mind, ruins &s;o many hail flouri&s;hing Con&s;titutions, and leads the ready Way to the Paths of Death, and eternal De&s;truction.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="18">
<P>So that notwith&s;tanding the State of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> was &s;o very deplorable as every one that has but read the 19th Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> knows it to be, on account of their enormous Lewdne&s;&s;es, and unnatural Debaucheries:</P>
<P>Yet our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour tells us, that the Condition of Chri&s;tians who act the&s;e abominations with them|&s;elves, will be far wor&s;e in the Day of Judgment:</P>
<P>The Thought of which, how much &s;oever any abandon'd <HI>Onanian</HI> may divert and put off from him&s;elf for the pre|&s;ent, yet it will one Day, to their eternal Wailling and Sor|row come upon them, unle&s;s they truly repent.</P>
<P>Now to any con&s;idering Per&s;on, can the momentary &s;atisfying of a Filthy Pa&s;&s;ion, be ever worth all this Mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>Since as an ancient Author truly &s;ays, 'tis only <HI>Momen|taneum quod delectat,</HI> but 'tis <HI>Aeternum quod cruciat.</HI></P>
<P>For one only Moments Plea&s;ure, every <HI>Onanian</HI> incurs an Eternity of Wailing, Torments, Mi&s;ery, and Sorrow.</P>
<P>Whoever acts &s;uch vile Things, is perfectly his own Slave, and is led on by his own Pa&s;&s;ion, as the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>As an Ox goes to the Slaughter,</HI> or, <HI>As a Bird ha&s;tens to the Snare,</HI> to his own Death and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ways are the Ways of Ruin, and AT BEST can end in nothing but Grief and Repentance, if ever any <HI>Onanian</HI> be &s;o happy as to grieve and repent for them.</P>
<P>O dear bought Moment of Plea&s;ure! A Bargain the mo&s;t to be regretted, that certainly ever any poor Sinner made, to purcha&s;e &s;o many Evils, and &s;uch a Train of Mi&s;eries, for one only Moments Satisfaction, in the acqui|ring of which every <HI>Onanian</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf much more &s;tupid than a &s;illy Fly in a Candle, that has &s;ome Cau&s;e to take the Flame to be &s;weet, becau&s;e it is beautiful.</P>
<P>For the little Fly &s;eeing the Flame, hovers greedily about it, to try whether it be as &s;weet as it &s;eems fair, and carried away with this Fancy, peri&s;hes at the fir&s;t trial.</P>
<P>But a poor <HI>Onanian</HI> knows very well, that what he is go|ing about is extremely filthy and ill in it &s;elf, highly offen&s;ive to <HI>Almighty God,</HI> and utterly ruinous to his own Per&s;on, and yet WILL commit the horrid Fact.</P>
<P>O Man! What art thou? An ancient Poet had Rea&s;on to &s;ay, <HI>Video Meliora, Proboque: Deteriora &s;equor.</HI> He SEES and knows, that the filthy Action he is going about, will be his Ruin, and yet He is re&s;olved, He WILL do it.</P>
<P>And all this for want of rightly con&s;idering the mi|&s;erable State this Sin involves him in; which &s;eriou&s;ly, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">rongly, and homely to repre&s;ent to him, is the De&s;ign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Purpo&s;e of this Book, and the Motive for writing on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">his difficult Subject.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="19">
<P>But as it is &s;o hard a Matter to write on a Subject of &s;o nice a Nature as this is, within the reach of the mean|e&s;t Capacities, without Danger of Encroachments upon the Bounds of Decency, and the Ri&s;que of giving Offence to cha&s;t Minds, notwith&s;tanding it may proceed from a De&s;ign to promote Virtue and di&s;courage Vice:</P>
<P>Therefore this Subject &s;hall be here &s;o treated, as to be rather le&s;s intelligible to &s;ome, by leaving &s;everal things to every Readers private Con&s;ideration, than by any over-freedom of Expre&s;&s;ion, to run the Hazard of putting <HI>That</HI> into any cha&s;t Mind, which every Per&s;on ought with the utmo&s;t Chri&s;tian Courage and Care to &s;tifle and de&s;troy.</P>

<P>For which Rea&s;on, if ever Caution, Care, Waryne&s;s, and Circum&s;pection is nece&s;&s;ary, in the treating of any Moral Subject, in the World, 'tis mo&s;t certainly in this, wherein St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought he could expre&s;s the Enormity of the Crime in no &s;tronger a Manner, than by impo&s;ing a perpetual Silence of it among&s;t all Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be doubted, but tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are con&s;cious to them&s;elves of having unhappily bartered and exchanged away their Innocence for a momentary Satisfaction, as <HI>E&s;au</HI> did his Birth-right for the pre&s;ent tran&s;ient Sen&s;uality of a Me&s;s of Pottage, and by con&s;e|quence have the Misfortune to find them&s;elves concerned in this pre&s;ent Treati&s;e, will &s;ufficiently under&s;tand the Meaning of it without much Explication, and 'tis to them it is recommended, with a hearty de&s;ire of their mo&s;t &s;e|rious Con&s;ideration of what is contained in it.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e whom it no way concerns, and by con&s;equence who under&s;tand it not (O happy Ignorance!) their un&s;potted Innocence is to be congratulated:</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Heinou&s;ne&s;s and Abomination of the Sin of Self-Defilement.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Word <HI>Self-Defilement,</HI> is here meant that unna|tural and &s;hameful Action, by which Per&s;ons of ei|ther Sex endeavour to cau&s;e, procure, and imitate with them&s;elves that Sen&s;ual Carnal Plea&s;ure, which <HI>Alm.

<P>The <HI>Cambridge</HI> Edition of the Bible has it thus, <HI>And the Thing which he did, di&s;plea&s;ed the Lord, wherefore He &s;lew him.</HI></P>
<P>So that the very Name of ONAN is fully &s;ufficient to put the Reader at once in mind both of the Sin, and the dreadful Puni&s;hment inflicted on him for it.</P>
<P>The other particulars of this unhappy Man <HI>Onan,</HI> in the perpetration of this Dete&s;table Action, as the <HI>Holy Scrip|ture</HI> Purpo&s;ely calls it, to make it to be the more abhorred, and dete&s;ted by all Mankind, as long as the World en|dures, &s;hall not be here mentioned, but every Reader is refer'd to the &s;erious peru&s;al of the ju&s;t now cited Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> where every one may read the whole Hi&s;tory at length, (as al&s;o of his Brother <HI>Er,</HI> who was likewi&s;e Slain for the &s;ame Fact) tran&s;mitted as dreadful Exam|ples to all &s;ucceeding Ages, to deter from an Action &s;o unnatural in it &s;elf, that no Brute is ever known to do it, but only (to his Shame be it &s;poken) unhappy Man.</P>
<P>And therefore it is very rea&s;onable to believe, that a great many Per&s;ons would never fall into this Sin, if they were but throly convinced of the grievou&s;ne&s;s of it, and the deplorable Con&s;equences to the Body in this World, as well as to the Soul in the next, which follow from it:</P>
<P>Which makes it highly nece&s;&s;ary, that Per&s;ons &s;hould be appri&s;ed how crying an Offence it is, in order to keep them from it.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="21">
<P>In Order then to this, it is remarkable, that there is no Place in the whole Scripture, where Sins of Impurity and Uncleanne&s;s are condemned, but <HI>This Unhappy One</HI> here treated of, is in a more particular Manner than others Pointed out to us, with a Conclu&s;ion, that <HI>Nothing Defiled, nor who</HI> ACTS WITH THEMSELVES <HI>&s;uch</HI> Abominable <HI>Things, &s;hall ever enter the Kingdom of God, but are to have their Share and Part hi the Lake, that Burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone.</HI></P>

<P>Where the Words ABUSING A PERSON'S SELF are u&s;ed, to expre&s;s with as much Mode&s;ty as is po&s;&s;ible the Unnatural Action this Treati&s;e is here writ again&s;t.</P>
<P>For of all the Actions which a rational Creature CAN po&s;&s;ibly commit, within the whole Latitude and Exten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his Liberty and Power, there is no One, by which Per&s;ons &s;o egregiou&s;ly ABUSE, and Ba&s;ely Di&s;honour them&s;elves, as by this one Vile Action of Self-Defilement.</P>
<P>And therefore St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, that the Heathens by the&s;e unclean Filthy Actions, not only Abu&s;ed and Defiled, <HI>but &s;hamefully Di&s;honoured</HI> their own Bodies.</P>
<P>This &s;ingularly mode&s;t Man St. <HI>Paul</HI> was indeed loath to Rake &s;o particularly into the Nature of the Action, as to expre&s;s it in any Manner what&s;oever, and therefore</P>
<P>Fir&s;t tells the Chri&s;tians of the Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> c. 5. ver. 12. That <HI>He was even a&s;hamed to mention and &s;peak of tho&s;e Things the Heathens did</HI> IN SECRET, meaning the Crime of Self-Defilement, which was &s;o common among&s;t them:</P>
<P>But finding him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking plain|ly to them, le&s;t they &s;hould not under&s;tand his Mean|ing, he cho&s;e out at lea&s;t the mode&s;te&s;t Words to explain him&s;elf by to them, that he could.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="22">
<P>Not at all doubting, but that tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who &s;hould hear his Letters read (as they u&s;ually were e&s;pe|cially on <HI>Sundays</HI> among&s;t the Primitive Chri&s;tians in their A&s;&s;emblies) would fu&s;ty under&s;tand his Meaning, and what Sin it was he forewarned them again&s;t.</P>
<P>And concludes with a mode&s;t Repetition in general of all he had &s;aid before, in the&s;e Words, That <HI>All tho&s;e who</HI> DO SUCH THINGS <HI>&s;hall never inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore he charges them every one, <HI>To Po&s;&s;e&s;s,</HI> Pre&s;erve, and Keep <HI>His Ve&s;&s;el</HI> (that s their Bodies) <HI>in Holine&s;s and Honour.</HI> As if he &s;hould have &s;aid, That all Sorts of Per&s;ons (without Exception) ought to be extremely watch|ful over THEIR OWN BODIES, and never to Abu&s;e nor Defile them by &s;uch unnatural Actions. &mdash; Again.</P>
<P>St <HI>Paul</HI> (who throughout his whole Mi&s;&s;ion, had always to do, with an abominably Lu&s;tful and Luxurious Set of Men, as fully appears from tho&s;e unnatural Vices he re|prehends in the Inhabitants of <HI>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephe&s;us, Colo&s;&s;ia, The&s;alonica,</HI> and tho&s;e other Provinces aban|doned to Luxury, which he writ his Letters to) thought he could produce no more powerful Argument to di&s;&s;wade them from this foul Sin, than to tell them, that their Bo|dies being the Temples of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> by con&s;equence to defile and abu&s;e &s;uch a Temple mu&s;t be the highe&s;t Offence again&s;t to Almighty God. &mdash; His Argument is this.</P>
<P>That if material Temples and Churches built only of Stone, and Mortar, and dediated to the external Wor|&s;hip only of God Almighty, are in no wi&s;e to be profaned:</P>
<P>Much le&s;s Spiritual ones, &s;uch as our Bodies are, in which the Spirit and Grace of Almighty God, and an im|mortal Soul honoured with his own Image, inhabits.</P>
<P>This Argument of this Great Apo&s;tle, and Reclaimer of tho&s;e Lu&s;tful Luxurious People, gives us clearly to un|der&s;tand, that whenever any Per&s;on commits any filthy and immode&s;t Action with them&s;elves, their Body is then Pro|faned, Sullied, and Defiled, and no more a Temple or Place for God Almighty's Grace to re&s;ide in.</P>
<P>And lea&s;t Per&s;ons &s;hou'd object, that hereby they do no Injury to any but them&s;elves, their Bodies being their own, and at their own di&s;po&s;al, this great Preacher of Puri|ty St. <HI>Paul,</HI> (fore&s;eeing this their Objection) tells them ex|pre&s;ly, that their Bodies are not their OWN, nor at their own di&s;po&s;al, no more than when a Per&s;on has BOUGHT any Thing, the Thing &s;o bought belongs no more to the Per&s;on who Sold it; and therefore St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells all Chri|&s;tians, that they are <HI>Bought and Redeemed with a great Pric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>

<P>THE BLINDNESS here meant, is that &s;piritual <HI>Blind|ne&s;s</HI> and Unconcernedne&s;s, with which mi&s;erable <HI>Onanians</HI> repeat this Crime.&mdash;For as for tho&s;e particular pernicious Effects which this Sin has proper to it &s;elf above all other Vices, on the SIGHT and EYES of the Body by draining off tho&s;e animal Spirits, which are &s;o the peculiar Strength of the <HI>Optick Nerves,</HI> as that Per&s;ons ad|dicted to this Vice, will find their <HI>Sight</HI> and <HI>Eyes</HI> to fail them a deal &s;ooner than otherw&s;ie they would, to their great Grief and Sorrow afterwards, when it is too late; this Subjects &s;hall be particularly treated of hereafter.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaking of the Sin here treated of, attributes the Commi&s;&s;ion of it to <HI>Blindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>In&s;en&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ays, that the <HI>Gentiles, Being pa&s;t feeling: had given them&s;elves over to Act all Uncleanne&s;s</HI> WITH THEMSELVES <HI>with Greedine&s;s.</HI>&mdash;And for this Rea&s;on St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> calls <HI>Spi|ritual Blindne&s;s</HI> a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of Almighty God upon Sins of Impurity, <HI>Spargit Deus paenales caecitates &s;uper illici|tas corum cupiditates.</HI> Almighty God throws a Darkne&s;s on the Under&s;tanding as a particular Puni&s;hment for this Sin:</P>
<P>And hence it is, that of tho&s;e great Numbers that are guilty of it, very few ever come to be truly &s;en&s;ible of it, but are lull'd a&s;leep in it, and eternally loo&s;e their Soul.</P>
<P>A Lo&s;s, to ballance which our Saviour expre&s;ly tells us, that even the gaining of the whole World is not an Equi|valent. <HI>What Profit is it to a Man to gain the whole World, if he lo&s;es his own Soul.</HI> Math. <HI>Chap.</HI> 16. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 26.</P>
<P>The &s;aving of which is every ones greate&s;t Affair, and every ones only Affair that he came into this World For:</P>
<P>'Tis the <HI>Unum nece&s;&s;arium,</HI> that <HI>One Thing</HI> which our Sa|viour declares to be only <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for all Mankind:</P>
<P>'Tis not <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to be great, to be Rich, and abound with the Things of this World, but it is ab&s;olutely <HI>Nece&s;&s;a|ry</HI> to be &s;aved: And yet <HI>Onanians</HI> are &s;o &s;tupidly Blind, as to exchange this Thing &s;o <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> to wit&punc; the &s;aving them&s;elves for all Eternity, for the gratifying this <HI>Lu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now what &s;piritual Darkne&s;s mu&s;t &s;urround &s;uch a Per|&s;on, that is thus &s;tark Blind in this <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Concern, and &s;o clear &s;ighted in other things that are Trifles?</P>
<PB N="12" REF="25">
<P>Yet there is one Thing more contradictory &s;till, which is, that a Per&s;on &s;hall with all the Unconcernedne&s;s of Mind imaginable fall into, and repeat this <HI>Crime</HI> over and over again, which he knows in his Con&s;cience is a deadly Sin, and not only cuts off at once, without bearing any Manner of Di&s;pute in the Matter, his Right for ever to the Kingdom of Heaven, but condemns him to the eternal Fire and Torments of Hell:</P>
<P>And yet at the &s;ame Time, out of a Principle of Religion and Chri&s;tianity, would not take a Fal&s;e Oath, nor renounce his Religion for all the World.</P>
<P>Again: How many are there in the World, who are punctually ju&s;t Men in their Dealings, no Swearers, no Drunkards, nor addicted to any vi&s;ible Vice, and firmly believe all the Truths of Chri&s;tian Religion, and yet fall Victims to them&s;elves, and the filthy Cravings of their own bea&s;tly Bodies, by living in this abominable Sin.</P>
<P>But what will all this avail them? <HI>Quid prode&s;t</HI> (&s;ays an ancient Author) <HI>&s;i quis Catholic&egrave; credat, &amp; Gentiliter vivat? Petr. Dam.</HI> What good does any Per&s;on's believing as a Chri&s;tian do him, if he acts like a Heathen, and does not u&s;e that Faith, as a Guide and Rule for his Actions?</P>
<P>How can any Per&s;on reconcile their Faith with &s;uch a Practice? And how can they make &s;uch a Practice, and their Rea&s;on agree? 'Tis very &s;urpri&s;ing, that Men of Sen&s;e and Wi&s;dom, who Rea&s;on &s;o well about every Thing el&s;e, &s;hould Rea&s;on &s;o very fal&s;ly in <HI>This?</HI></P>
<P>A poor blind <HI>Onanian</HI> freely owns his Action to be a ve|ry great Crime, highly offen&s;ive to God Almighty, and if unrepented of, mo&s;t certainly throws him for all Eterni|ty into Hell Fire: All this he will argue over with the &s;tronge&s;t of Rea&s;oning and Eloquene with him&s;elf, and yet will habitually live in this odious Sin.</P>
<P>From whence can this Stupidity, and contradicting thus his own Rea&s;on proceed? He believes the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tian Religion, and is ready to Die rather than renounce this Faith, altho they are not only above his Under&s;tanding, but even &s;eem to &s;hock his Rea&s;on:</P>
<P>And at the &s;ame equally believes the&s;e abominable Ac|tions he lives in the commi&s;&s;ion of, to be grievous Sins, and that the doing of them condemns him for all Eter|nity to Hell Fire, and yet WILL do them.</P>
<P>Whence come the&s;e &s;o very unaccountable Contradic|tions thus between an <HI>Onanian</HI>'s Life, and his Faith?</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this can be nothing el&s;e, but becau&s;e the believing the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tian Religion, does not contradict nor thwart his Pa&s;&s;ions:</P>
<PB N="13" REF="26">
<P>So that altho it is as equally certain that an <HI>Onanian</HI> will be eternally Lo&s;t for the commi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e abomi|nable Actions, as he would be, if he renounced his Faith, and turned Heathen, both being alike grounded on the &s;ame infallible Authority, <HI>viz.</HI> the Word of God:</P>
<P>Yet becau&s;e the one does not contradict his Pa&s;&s;ions, and the other does, therefore for the &s;ake of a Moment's Plea&s;ure, he will thus contradict, and act again&s;t his own Rea&s;on, and give him&s;elf for all his Life time after, &s;uch va&s;t Room for Grief and Repentance.</P>
<P>What a &s;ort of Faith &s;hall we call this?</P>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Dead Faith;</HI> which can no more &s;ave an impeni|tent <HI>Onanian,</HI> than the mo&s;t moral good Works will &s;ave an ob&s;tinate Heathen. Now let an <HI>Onanian</HI> ask him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly, whether he really believes all this or not?</P>
<P>If he does not believe any thing of this, then he does in other things a great deal too much, by being a ju&s;t Man in his Dealings where &s;afe Opportunities of Gain by Frauds offer them&s;elves without ever being detected:</P>
<P>By not being a Drunkard, a Swearer, an Adulterer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which corrupt Nature inclines to.</P>
<P>And if he does really believe the&s;e Truths, then 'tis beyond Di&s;pute, that he does not do near enough.</P>
<P>What then is this Faith? What is this offending God Almighty? This Soul and its being either &s;aved for all <HI>Eternity,</HI> or lo&s;t for all <HI>Eternity,</HI> that is &s;o much talked of?</P>
<P>'Tis in reality nothing el&s;e but this: That a great many &s;ay they believe the Truths of Chri&s;tian Religion, becau&s;e they will be of the Fa&s;hion of the <HI>Country</HI> where they live:</P>
<P>So that in Rigour, &s;uch Per&s;ons calling them&s;elves Chri|&s;tians, is no more than conforming to Cu&s;tom and Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>For el&s;e; as no Man ever in his Sen&s;es, would travel any particular Road, if he was credibly informed and firmly believed that there were High-way-men and Robbers in that very Road, that would murder him:</P>
<P>So, either this is the exact Condition of every <HI>Onanian,</HI> or el&s;e his Faith, the Go&s;pel and Chri&s;tian Religion mu&s;t &s;eem to him as a Fable, our Saviour an Impo&s;tor, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> a Lyar and a Cheat, thus to per&s;wade Men from and threaten them out of their Plea&s;ure, and taking their Swing in <HI>This</HI> World, for a mere Nothing in the <HI>Next.</HI></P>
<P>And if a Heathen was to be asked his Opinion of &s;uch a Per&s;on, that &s;ays he believes what the Chri&s;tian Religion teaches, and yet acts &s;o contrary to it, he would pre&s;ent|ly an&s;wer, that either he does not really believe, or el&s;e, that he is a Madman to act &s;o oppo&s;ite to his Faith.</P>

<P>For by thus robbing and violently Forcing from them|&s;elves their Strength, and empoveri&s;hing their Spirits, by depriving their Bodies of its Balmy, and vital Juice, by this dete&s;table Vice, they have become &s;o dry and emacia|ted as to be &s;ent to their Graves a great many Years &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e they would have been.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Condition of an <HI>ONANIAN</HI> on a Dying Bed.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to fix the better your Imagination of this Me|lancholy and dreadful Time, &s;uppo&s;e your &s;elf now upon your Death-bed, in your la&s;t Sickne&s;s, having but a few Hours more to live, reduced, (as ONE DAY you WILL be) to the la&s;t Extremity of Weakne&s;s:</P>
<P>Your Soul oppre&s;&s;ed and over whelm'd with Fear, your Heart already &s;eized by the Convul&s;ions of Death, your Breath failing, your Colour changed, your Eyes ju&s;t ready to clo&s;e them&s;elves for ever to Time, and open in a new State to Eternity, of which you know nothing.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e your Self again abandon'd by all you &s;o dear|ly loved, and ju&s;t upon the Point of leaving the World, and expiring either by your &s;elf alone, or at be&s;t in the Arms of &s;ome Dome&s;tick, Relation, or Friend.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being thus &s;uppo&s;ed: Con&s;ider next how &s;trangely a Lu&s;tful dying Per&s;on is now changed:</P>
<P>He who a few Days ago was &s;trong and in perfect Health, and in the full Enjoyment of his Plea&s;ures, is now all on a &s;udden confin'd to his Bed, reduced to ex|remity, unable to help him&s;elf, uncapable of Plea&s;ure <HI>the Pur&s;uit of which has been his only Aim</HI>) and now forced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o abandon all, and to be abandon'd by all.</P>
<P>So that the Separation whereby a <HI>Sen&s;uali&s;t</HI> is by Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nathed from his Plea&s;ures, is &s;till the more terrible to him, ina&s;much as the more any one has loved their Plea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">s, the greater Grief will it be to him to part with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hem; and the more he has &s;ought after them in his Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ime, the more bitter will Death be to him.</P>
<P>Every One, that does but &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on this, mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ry out, <HI>Lord! what is Man, tho he enjoys never &s;o much Plea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, &s;ince a few Hours Sickne&s;s are thus able to make him u&s;ele&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o all the World, and render all the World of no u&s;e to him.</HI></P>
<P>What will be able to comfort this unhappy Per&s;on in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">his dreadful Hour? When the Remembrance of his pa&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ameful Defilements leaves only a mortal Regret behind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, and the Fear of &s;uture Pains makes him already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">egin to feel them.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="31">
<P>When every Thing con&s;pires to terrify and fright him.</P>
<P>How do the Tears of Friends cut him to the Heart?</P>
<P>With what Fear has he recour&s;e to de&s;perate Remedies, and what a Terror is it to find tho&s;e Remedies prove in|effectual? And he who but a few Days ago had a Con&s;ti|tution that promi&s;ed the Enjoyment of Plea&s;ures for ma|ny Years, has not now even Hours to enjoy them.</P>
<P>But to calm his Frights, a Clergy-man is de&s;ired to come and Pray with him. And does this Allay his <HI>Trouble?</HI></P>
<P>He trembles and is confounded, at the remembrance of his pa&s;t &s;hameful Actions, which he now blu&s;hes at</P>
<P>How di&s;mal mu&s;t his Apprehen&s;ions be, after &s;o many repeated <HI>Self-Defilements,</HI> to think that now he has but a few Hours more to live, and is going to have his De&s;tiny determined, either of being &s;aved, or lo&s;t for all Eternity.</P>
<P>And in this Agony, He is now with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this his &s;piritual Friend to prepare for <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>But is this a fit Time for it, when he is ju&s;t going to ex|pire? When Fear and Trouble has weakened his Rea&s;on, how can he go about &s;o great a Work?</P>
<P>A Work that requires the greate&s;t Lei&s;ure, Application, and Tranquility of Mind that is po&s;&s;ible, and for which all the Saints have ever thought their whole Lives too &s;hort, and this &s;ick Man has it now all upon his Hands to di&s;patch on a &s;udden in a Hurry, and in a few Hours:</P>
<P>And al&s;o at a Time the mo&s;t improper of any for it, when his Ills and Pains render him &s;o uncapable of apply|ing even to any Small Affairs, that his Phy&s;ician ab&s;olute|ly forbids it, and now at this Time, he has the great and intricate Account of his Soul to adju&s;t and make up.</P>
<P>If 'tis &s;o difficult a Thing to prepare for Death as it is whil&s;t a Per&s;on is in Health, and has his Head clear and free to think, how hard, <HI>(not to &s;ay almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible)</HI> mu&s;t it be on a &s;ick Bed, when the Head is racked with Pains and cannot apply, and the whole Body &s;o di&s;ordered, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> quiet free Thought can &s;carce be had.</P>
<P>So that he has put off his Repentance to a Time, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> is no Time for him: A Time of Sickne&s;s being to Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> at all for &s;uch a Per&s;on as this to Prepare for Death in.</P>

<P>What &s;hould we think of a Governour who neglects t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> repair the Breaches of his Town, and lets his Magazine remain empty, 'till he is clo&s;e be&s;ieged, and the Trenche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> opened?</P>
<PB N="19" REF="32">
<P>Death is a dangerous Voiage, a Dying Man is going to &s;ail from Time to Eternity among Rocks and Tempe&s;ts:</P>
<P>It is a &s;udden Siege where his Enemy blocks him up in a Moment, and can he think this a fit time to prepare, him&s;elf in to Fight? No: No: Whoever puts off their Conver&s;ion to this Time, mo&s;t wretchedly cheats them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And for this rea&s;on our Saviour bids us <HI>be ready</HI> when the Hour comes, and not then to prepare our &s;elves.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider a little farther, what pa&s;&s;es between this dying Per&s;on and his &s;piritual Friend.</P>
<P>He now &s;peaks not his own Sentiments, but only re|peats what the Clergy-man puts in his Mouth, not know|ing perhaps what he &s;ays, or what he ought to &s;ay.</P>
<P>The Merits and Pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, which in this la&s;t Hour is the great Con&s;olation of a Good Man on a Death-Bed, now only &s;erves to ubraid this Sinner.</P>
<P>With whom then &s;hall he now find Ea&s;e?</P>
<P>His Friends and Relations retire, leaving him and the Clergy-man by them&s;elves for a while alone.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider now what Thoughts this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Per&s;on will have, when the Divine only &s;tays to exhort him to fix his Eyes on Je&s;us Chri&s;t crucified, and to inform him, that being now pa&s;t all Hopes of Recovery, and bereft of all Creatures, Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone mu&s;t be his only Refuge and Con&s;olation.&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t crucified mu&s;t be now, Dear Brother <HI>(&s;ays the Divine)</HI> your only Hope, &amp;c.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t &s;eek Strength in his Death, again&s;t the Fear of your's: Place then your Confidence in this comfortable Object, in the Thoughts of which I leave you to your &s;elf: And the Clergy-man withdraws for a while.</P>
<P>This is the End of all tho&s;e &s;hameful Plea&s;ures, which Lu&s;tful Per&s;ons with &s;o much Greedine&s;s pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Did it ever enter into &s;uch a Per&s;on's Thoughts on his Death-bed, to regret that he had not in his Life plea&s;ed him&s;elf, and gratified his bruti&s;h craving <HI>Pa&s;&s;ios</HI> more?</P>
<P>Every dying Per&s;on will repent his having plea&s;ed him &s;elf too much, but never that he did not more.</P>
<P>But ala&s;s, there is now no more World for him; he has acted <HI>His</HI> Part on the Stage of it, and mu&s;t now (notwith|&s;tanding all his unwillingne&s;s) go off from it.</P>
<P>And as Actors go off a Stage with Applau&s;e, more or le&s;s according to the Merits of their Performance; &s;o this dying Man goes off the Stage of this Life loaded with his Self-Defilements and Impurities, as our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our foretold of impenitent Chri&s;tians. <HI>John</HI> chap. 8. v. 21. That <HI>they &s;hall die in their Sins.</HI></P>
<PB N="20" REF="33">
<P>What Comfort will this Per&s;on find now in thinking of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has during his Life had &s;o little re|&s;emblance to him? Whil&s;t in Health, how often has he perhaps made a Je&s;t of the great Truths of Chri&s;tian Religion? And now he mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all his <HI>Rallery,</HI> in a few Hours appear before the great Founder of it.</P>
<P>The Divine vi&s;its him again and prays by him, and &s;ays,</P>

<P>He utters this indeed with his trembling Lips, but his <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Fears</HI> do &s;o cloud his <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> that he &s;carce has Liberty to u&s;e it, and by con&s;equence &s;carce knows what he &s;ays&mdash;Next: What Terror mu&s;t it be to him to hear the Clergy-man go on with tho&s;e Words?</P>
<P><HI>We commend the Soul of this thy Servant into thy Hands, O Lord,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;To him who loved his Plea&s;ures and the World &s;o much as he has done:</P>
<P>Nay who perhaps never loved any Thing el&s;e but his Plea&s;ures, and never made <HI>One</HI> &s;erious real Step towards <HI>Heaven</HI> in all his Life.&mdash;Again: What a Terror mu&s;t; tho&s;e Words give him,&mdash;<HI>Go Chri&s;tian Soul out of this World:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Profci&s;cere Ammo Chri&s;tiana de hoc Mundo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is no more for you to do in it:</P>
<P>You mu&s;t leave it; but How? And Why?</P>
<P>By Force: And becau&s;e your Plea&s;ures leave you, and not you them.&mdash;St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> &s;peaking to you in this Condition tells you, <HI>Serm.</HI> 1.</P>
<P><HI>Non vis relinquere Mundum, relinquet te Mundus.</HI></P>
<P>You are unwilling to leave the World and your Plea|&s;ures, but that's nothing, the World will now leave you:</P>
<P>There is no avoiding it, a Dying Per&s;on cannot help it:</P>
<P>There is no Appeal.&mdash;You MUST go Chri&s;tian Soul out of this World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You mu&s;t leave it,&mdash;But</P>
<P>The <HI>Divine</HI> goes on: <HI>Accept O Lord his Tears,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>What Tears?&mdash;Ala&s;s! Tears and Sorrow from his unwil|lingne&s;s to Die, and leave the World and his Plea&s;ures, and becau&s;e he can enjoy them no longer: Nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord! In what a Condition is this dying Man?</P>
<P>If he has yet his Sen&s;es left, the Remembrance of his pa&s;t Actions rifle his very Soul, and tear him to peeces.</P>
<P>The &s;hameful Action now leaves him, being no more capable of it, and not he the Action.</P>
<P>O Death! How terrible is thy Memory to this poor Wretch, thus drown'd and, ab&s;orpt in his own Guilt?</P>

<P>THis almo&s;t Di&s;tracted SENSUALIST being now upon the brink of having his <HI>Eternal Doom</HI> decided, his pa&s;t Actions tear him with inexpre&s;&s;ible Remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Every one of his pa&s;t <HI>Defilements</HI> appears now to him as big as a <HI>Mountain,</HI> and in all its Deformity and gha&s;tly Shape, which before he cheated him&s;elf in the Commi&s;|&s;ion of, by the deceiving Name of <HI>Weakne&s;s and Frailty.</HI></P>
<P>How di&s;mal mu&s;t the Apprchen&s;ions of this dying LEACHER be, when he reflects that he has now but a few Hours more to live, and if not &s;incerely reconciled to <HI>Almighty God,</HI> by a true <HI>Repentance,</HI> is for ever lo&s;t?</P>
<P>What mu&s;t this Sinner do at this dreadful Hour?</P>
<P>In which St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, that the very Saints them|&s;elves are not &s;ecure, 1 Epi&s;tle Ch. 4. v. 18. <HI>If the right|cous &s;carcely are &s;aved, where &s;hall the wicked appear?</HI></P>
<P>In this terrible Extremity, ALL that he has ever in his Life Time heard of <HI>Judgment,</HI> of <HI>Hell,</HI> of <HI>Eternity,</HI> and other awakening Truths of <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> comes now all on a &s;udden fre&s;h into his Mind, and fright him.</P>
<P>And 'tis wonderful that he, who &s;ome few Days ago was &s;o full of <HI>Doubts,</HI> and <HI>Uncertainties</HI> as to <HI>Religion,</HI> and who made almo&s;t a Je&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;tanity,</HI> and the Purity of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and would believe SO LITTLE, &s;hould now be &s;o fully convinced of the&s;e Truths, and all on a &s;udden believe SO MUCH: For no People in the World believe more, or have &s;tronger Faith than <HI>Dying Men:</HI></P>
<P>But what does this convincing Faith avail an impenitent <HI>Onanian</HI> then? The Devils believe as much as any Chri&s;tians:</P>
<P>But as St. <HI>James</HI> &s;ays, 2.19. their Faith only, &s;erves to make them tremble. <HI>Doemones credunt &amp; contrenn&s;cunt.</HI></P>
<P>And ju&s;t in the &s;ame Ca&s;e is this Per&s;on on a <HI>Dying-bed.</HI></P>
<P>What lie was &s;o unwilling to believe all his Life Time, he cannot help believing now: So that a Death-Bed will give him a lively Faith, when nothing el&s;e will.</P>
<P>This Per&s;on whil&s;t he was well and in Health, made nothing of ridiculeing <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Religion:</HI></P>
<P>Let him now carry on the Je&s;t with his Wit and Rallery if he can. No, No, A. Death-Bed teaches a true Le&s;&s;on, convinces the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, and opens their Eyes.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="35">
<P>If ever a Man's Judgment is impartial, 'twill be on a Death-Bed. Then the Mind is fill'd with cruel Remor&s;e, the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is terribly awaken'd, pa&s;t <HI>Defilements</HI> come fre&s;h in to the Mind, and &s;eizes it with inexpre&s;&s;ible Con&s;ternation:</P>
<P>And 'tis then, that every <HI>Sen&s;uali&s;t</HI> will begin to open their Eyes, and to judge of things after quite another Manner than ever they did before, and would give <HI>All the whole World,</HI> were it at their Di&s;po&s;al, that they could now call their pa&s;t Actions back again.</P>
<P>Now Terror and Remor&s;e begin to &s;hew them&s;elves, and the dying Man is &s;eized with inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Now he would <HI>for&s;ake</HI> his Sin: Now he <HI>condemns</HI> him&s;elf:</P>
<P>Now he is willing to open his Ca&s;e to his &s;piritual Friend, who before could never be brought to it.</P>
<P>But ala&s;s! It is now too late, he has no more Time left, He is a Dying: &mdash; He is now of no more u&s;e to the World, nor it to him. He may with good Rea&s;on cry out</P>

<P>The Example of the good Thelf's <HI>Repentance</HI> has very little room here to encourage any Delay to &s;uch Per&s;ons of their Conver&s;ion. Becau&s;e as St. <HI>Aug.</HI> ju&s;tly &s;ays,</P>
<P><HI>The Scripture comfortably furni&s;hes us with this Example of</HI> ONE <HI>True Death Bed Repentance, that we may not</HI> De&s;pair.</P>
<P>But ala&s;s! it is the only ONE throughout the whole Scripture, that we may not <HI>Pre&s;ume,</HI> and to convince us, what a Height of Folly <HI>(not to &s;ay Madne&s;s)</HI> it is, and how extremely dangerous to live in the habitual commi&s;&s;ion of this abominable Sin with any &s;uch ill grounded Hopes.</P>
<P>So that whatever Per&s;on does &s;o, mo&s;t mi&s;erably im|po&s;es upon, and abominably CHEATS him&s;elf at la&s;t, with only an Appearance of Conver&s;ion and Repentance.</P>
<P>If therefore any deluded <HI>Sen&s;uali&s;ts</HI> find them&s;elves di&s;|po&s;ed to take any Encouragement in remaining in the Ha|bit of this dete&s;table Vice, from the Example of tho&s;e <HI>&s;o very Few,</HI> who have ri&s;en again, and &s;incerely and tru|ly Repented, after terrible Falls;</P>
<PB N="23" REF="36">
<P>Let &s;uch know, that they have much more Rea&s;on to tremble at the Remembrance of infinite <HI>Numbers</HI> of others who have fallen in like Manner, and never did ri&s;e, but have been utterly undone by it, and eternally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>If a Per&s;on could die Twice, an unprepared Fir&s;t Death might be repaired by a Second: But he can die but ONCE, and an Eternity of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery de|pends upon this ONCE. And being once only ill done is for ever ill done, and never can be repaired.</P>
<P>Any One then who goes on in his Sin, with the De&s;ign of Repenting on a Death-bed; puts it off to a <HI>Time,</HI> the mo&s;t unfit for it of all his whole Life, and which (is to be feared) will prove no Time at all for him.</P>
<P>If a good Death con&s;i&s;ted only in a few Tears, in ha|ving a few Friends to pray by one, in having the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Divine, in a Remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, a De|&s;ign to amend, and even in receiving the Holy Sacrament, this Per&s;on's Madne&s;s would not be near &s;o great:</P>
<P>But ala&s;s! How many daily die with all the&s;e VERY SAME Helps, and many more, and yet Die mi&s;erably, and are now irreparably lo&s;t for all eternity?</P>
<P>And could but any of them return upon Earth, to tell us how all this came to pa&s;s, and could po&s;&s;ibly be with &s;o many Helps; their An&s;wer would be, that they died mi&s;erably, becau&s;e they did not prepare before hand, by quitting this Sin in Time when they might.</P>
<P>They would al&s;o tell us, that tho&s;e Helps they had on their Death Beds, were only <HI>Opera Operata,</HI> meer <HI>outward Works,</HI> which to them were of no Effect, for want of re|qui&s;ite <HI>Inward</HI> Di&s;po&s;tions, and a real Conver&s;ion of the Heart, and a leaving off this abominable Sin whil&s;t they were in Health: Whereas their profe&s;&s;ing with their Lips outwardly to dete&s;t, renounce, and leave this Sin now at a Time, when the Sin leaves them, de&s;erves no manner of Thanks to them at all for it.</P>
<P>And that this is evidently true, fully appears from tho&s;e who do by a &s;ingular Mercy of Almighty God, recover from great Fits of Sickne&s;&s;es, after, all imaginable Prote|&s;tations whil&s;t they were Sick, of mending their Lives in Ca&s;e of Recovery: But when recovered, think no more on't, but return again <HI>(like a Dog to his Vomit)</HI> to their old Ways. Which is a convincing Proof, how little Death-Bed Prote&s;tations and De&s;igns are to be depended on.</P>
<P>So that 'tis not having a Sorrow upon a Death-Bed, that is merely enough, Numbers having gone oat of this World perfectly bathed in Tears, and in appearance Sor|rowful, and yet have been eternally lo&s;t:</P>
<PB N="24" REF="37">
<P>And the Rea&s;on of this has been, becau&s;e their Sor|row was for leaving the World, and all they loved in it, and nor for having offended <HI>Almighty God.</HI>&mdash;Again:</P>
<P>How can any One imagin that he &s;hall be able up|on a Death-Bed to hate what he has all his Life time &s;o loved, &s;o doated upon, and &s;o eagerly pur&s;ued?</P>
<P>And yet every Dying Per&s;on that does not truly abo|minate his darling and beloved Sin above any Thing in the World, and this for the Love of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> who is highly offended thereby, will be eternally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>This is as true, as that he has committed the Sin, which when once committed, the Delinquent is always <HI>Certain</HI> of, but entirely <HI>Uncertain</HI> of the Pardon of it.</P>
<P>Will it be ea&s;y for this Man, now all on a &s;udden to dete&s;t and abhor what he has always &s;o much loved, and who perhaps never made &s;o much as one &s;erious Act of Repentance for it, in his <HI>whole Life.</HI></P>
<P>Will it be ea&s;y for One who has doated on this Sin all his Life, now to abhor it, becau&s;e Death tears him from it, and becau&s;e he now is no more able to commit it.</P>
<P>No No: Deceive not your &s;elf, every <HI>Onanian,</HI> whoever you are that reads this Book: This will <HI>One Day</HI> be your own Ca&s;e really and in Fact, as now it is in Imagination.</P>
<P>Oh! the mi&s;erable State, will &s;uch a One &s;ay to him|&s;elf, whereto I find my &s;elf now reduced! Oh! that whil&s;t I was in Health, I had left off this Sin!</P>
<P>But I have brought my &s;elf now (by continuing in it) to that Pa&s;s, that I am (morally &s;peaking) unable to Re|pent for it. And now after all, I am come to my La&s;t Day, I am laid upon that Bed, from whence I &s;hall ri&s;e no more, but mu&s;t go to appear before my God loaded and defiled with the&s;e my repeated Crimes.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider again, what long and langui&s;hing Farewells your Soul will give to her Body and this World.</P>
<P>She will then take her Leave of all tho&s;e pa&s;t &s;hame|ful Actions &s;he has &s;o long been en&s;laved to, together with an eternal Farewell to Riches, Vanities, Company, Plea&s;ures, Pa&s;times, Friends, Neighbours, Kindred, Chil|dren, Husband, Wife, and in &s;ine to every Creature, and at la&s;t even to her own Body, which &s;he is now about to leave Pale, Hideous, and Loath&s;ome.</P>
<P>And thus the poor <HI>Onanian</HI> expires, and becomes a mournful, but indeed a very moving Sight to deter Lu&s;t|ful Per&s;ons, from the Commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Unnatural Acti|ons, which have now given &s;o much Trouble to this poor decea&s;ed Wretch's Soul at pre&s;ent, and render'd his Doom &s;o uncertain for the future.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Condition of an <HI>ONANIAN</HI> departed this Life.</HEAD>
<P>THis SENSUALIST being after all now dead, altho <HI>Re&s;ore,</HI> the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and beautiful Per&s;on in the World, now in&s;pires nothing but Horror:</P>
<P>Immediately ALL is &s;ilent, the Corps is covered, the Curtains are drawn, and every one retires, with a (faint|ly as they go) <HI>Lord have Mercy upon his Soul.</HI></P>
<P>And the u&s;ual COMPLIMENT now made him is,</P>
<P><HI>He is gone poor Man:</HI> HE WAS NO BOBY'S ENEMY BUT HIS OWN. <HI>God's Peace be with him,</HI> they will &s;ay: and that's all: He is gone after all his Plea&s;ure, and has carried all his Actions (for his Pa&s;port) along with him:</P>
<P>And the Be&s;t they can &s;ay is, <HI>We hope he has made his Peace with God,</HI> &amp;c. Oh Peace! How uncertain and doubt ful art thou to this poor Wretch, that never perhaps thought of thee, 'till reduced to a Dying-Bed?</P>
<P>Where is now the Beauty, the Galantry, and good Mien of this Per&s;on? What is become of all his Plea&s;ures?</P>
<P>But above all, what is become of his Soul?</P>
<P>Ala&s;s! of this we have all the Rea&s;on in the World, from his foregoing Conduct, to apprehend but badly.</P>
<P>What now becomes of this Body &s;o often defiled?</P>
<P>It begins already to grow offen&s;ive and burden&s;ome.</P>
<P>So that notwith&s;tanding all its former Charms and Beau|ty, every Body now flies it, <HI>Nor would any one now lie but one only Night alone in a Bed with it, on any Account what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P>Husband, Wife, Children, Relations, Friends, Neigh|bours, Servants are all in a hurry to get rid of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who loved it be&s;t, are now mo&s;t de&s;irous to have it convey'd away, and put out of Sight:</P>
<P>They All make ha&s;t to Nail it up, and put it into the Ground, and &s;o get rid of it: And <HI>Would not for any thing, &s;o much as only Look at it, a few Weeks after.</HI></P>
<P>Thus this Per&s;on is forgot almo&s;t as &s;oon as gone, every one returns to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, your Friends &s;eek other Friends, take new Mea&s;ures, and hardly think any more of you.</P>
<P>They concern them&s;elves no more about you, than if you had never been, they often undo all you had done, and in a little Time you are no more talked off.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="39">
<P>All the Plea&s;ures of this <HI>Sen&s;uali&s;t</HI> thus end in a Shroud, a Coffin, the Grave, Worms, Rottenne&s;s, and Corruption:</P>
<P>But the immortal Soul of this &s;o often defiled Body is gone into a new Region and among&s;t new Company, to be Judged and have its definitive Sentence pa&s;ted upon it; either to go to the Right-hand, or to the Left:</P>
<P>Ala&s;s! whither &s;hall yours go? What Way &s;hall it take?</P>
<P>No other than that which it has begun here in this World.&mdash;The Sentence pa&s;&s;ed on unrepenting <HI>Onanians</HI> is this, <HI>Go ye Cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> Math. 25.51.</P>
<P>Ponder well every One, that reads this, the&s;e weigh|ty Words. Go, &s;ays the Judge. A Word of Eternal Ba|ni&s;hment from Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He calls them <HI>Cur&s;ed.</HI> O how dreadful a Cur&s;e mu&s;t this be? A General Cur&s;e including all Woes, an Irrevo|cable Cur&s;e, comprehending all Times:</P>
<P>The Judge adds, <HI>into Everla&s;ting Fire:</HI> Oh Eternity of Pains, how dreadful wilt thou be to this poor <HI>Sen&s;uali&s;t,</HI> that has done little el&s;e but indulged him&s;elf in Plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Men are &s;o u&s;ed to hear Talk of Hell, that it very lit|tle affects them, whereas if every <HI>Onanian</HI> was but truly &s;en&s;ible what Hell is, he would tremble at the very thought of committing an Action, that &s;o certainly <HI>In&s;ures</HI> it to him.</P>
<P>In order then to make every One, that may read this Book, as &s;en&s;ible of this State of Mi&s;ery, as our gro&s;s Conceptions, and material Compari&s;ons can make it,</P>
<P>Imagin that you &s;ee in the Center of the Earth a va&s;t Gulph and Lake of Fire and Flames, and tho&s;e two unhappy Men <HI>Er</HI> and <HI>Onan,</HI> together with all others who have impenitently imitated them in the Perpetration of this abominable Fact, plunged and roling in it, all cover|ed and tran&s;per&s;ed with Fire, which they not only &s;uck in with their Breath, but which enters al&s;o at their Eyes and Ears, their Mouths and No&s;trils ca&s;ting forth dread|ful Flames, their Skin &s;corched, their Fle&s;h, Blood, Hu|mors, and Brains boiling up with the Violence of the Burning, their Bones and Marrow all tran&s;parent with Fire, like a Piece of Iron taken red Hot out of a Furnace, and all the Parts of their Bodies glowing with Fire.</P>
<P>Having here put <HI>Er</HI> along with his Brother <HI>Onan,</HI> the Reader doubtle&s;s will de&s;ire to know, whether or not the Crime of <HI>Er</HI> was the &s;ame as that of <HI>Onan,</HI> the Holy Scripture mentioning only of him, That <HI>Er Judah</HI>'s <HI>Fir&s;t Born was wicked in the Sight of the Lord, and the Lord &s;lew him.</HI> Gen. 38.7.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="40">
<P>And afterwards <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 10. in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Edition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bible, &s;peaking of the Puni&s;hment of <HI>Onan,</HI> &s;ays that <HI>The Lord &s;lew him</HI> ALSO.</P>
<P>Commentators on this Place of the Scripture all agree, that the Crime of the&s;e two Brothers <HI>Er</HI> and <HI>Onan</HI> was ex|actly the &s;ame as to the Fact, but only, different as to the Motive: <HI>Er</HI> would not have his Wife <HI>Thamar</HI> bear Chil|dren, to pre&s;erve her Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Onan</HI> would not have her bear a Child by him, becau&s;e (according to the Law) it would not be called by his Name, nor e&s;teemed HIS.

<P>How glad would the&s;e two unhappy Men be to &s;uffer only from <HI>Our</HI> Fire? But ala&s;s there is no compari&s;on be|tween it, and the Fire of Hell.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> compares <HI>Our</HI> Fire to it, as only a painted Fire. Our Fire is light&s;ome, their's is dark and horrible.</P>
<P>Ours is the Effect of the Goodne&s;s, and Bounty of God, their's is the Product of his incen&s;ed Omnipotence.</P>
<P>Again: Repre&s;ent to your &s;elf a Man tormented with the Gout, or &s;ome other violent Pain.</P>
<P>What Torment does he feel? How does he cry out?</P>
<P>How willingly would he die to put an End to his Tor|ture? And yet he &s;uffers only in &s;ome ONE Part of his Body: He has the Liberty of complaining, and the Sa|tisfaction of &s;eeing him&s;elf pittied.</P>
<P>But what would he undergo, if every Member and Part of his Body &s;uffered the &s;ame Torment?</P>
<P>And if in&s;tead of helping and pittying him, every Stander-by &s;hould abu&s;e and upbraid him without any Liberty of Complaining?</P>
<P>In Hell, the Damn'd do not only &s;uffer the Pains to which we are &s;ubject in this Life, they &s;uffer all the&s;e and infi|nitely more, their Torments are univer&s;al, violent, com|plicated, and un&s;upportable, and yet they MUST and do in every In&s;tant of Time feel them ALL, and in the Mid&s;t of them ALL, they cannot receive, or even &s;o much as hope for any Re&s;pite, Ea&s;e, or Comfort.</P>
<P>What would only ONE poor &s;ingle Drop of Water be again&s;t &s;uch a Sea and Torrent of Flames?

<P>The Sick find &s;ome Ea&s;e in tumbling and removing from one Place to another, but unhappy <HI>Onan</HI> together with his Brother <HI>Er,</HI> and their Followers, are now at this Time that <HI>You</HI> read this, in this Fire immovable as at Rock.</P>
<P>But all this is the lea&s;t Part of their Suffering; for notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Torments are &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, yet it would be an inexpre&s;&s;ible Comfort to them, if they were but ever to have an End: But what adds infinitely to their Mi&s;eries, is their Knowledge that all the&s;e Torments will be for all Eternity, and never are to have an End.</P>
<P>So that notwith&s;tanding all their Horror, there is no Manner of Hopes that they will ever end, or dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>What are now the Thoughts of tho&s;e two mi&s;erable Men <HI>Onan,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Er?</HI> Who have now been in all the&s;e Torments almo&s;t <HI>Four Thou&s;and Years,</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e two young Men were cut off by Alm.

<P>Was mi&s;erable <HI>Onan</HI> together with his Brother <HI>Er,</HI> oblig|ed to fill only the Hollow of a Man's Hand with each of their Tears, and each of them to drop but ONE &s;ingle Tear at the End of every Thou&s;and Years: What a terri|ble Duration would this be? <HI>Onan</HI> would have now &s;hed but <HI>Three</HI> Tears towards it; and his unhappy Brother <HI>Er</HI> ju&s;t as many: But if each of them were obliged at the &s;ame Rate of <HI>One &s;ingle Tear for every Thou&s;and Years</HI> to make a Brook or a River with their Tears, or even to fill the Sea, what a prodigious Length of Time would this require? Our Imaginations are Lo&s;t and confounded, our Thoughts are &s;tun'd in &s;o va&s;t a Duration.</P>
<P>And yet all this great and inconceivable Extent of Time is nothing to Eternity, and that Duration which the&s;e unhappy Wretches are to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>A Time WILL come when <HI>Onan</HI> and every one of his Imitators will be able to &s;ay, that <HI>One Tear for every Thou&s;and Years</HI> that I have been in Hell would have been equal to the Sea, would have drown'd the World, and would have fill'd up the immence Space between Heaven and Earth, and yet I am to begin again, to &s;hed the &s;ame Quantity of Tears over, and over, and ever again; hav|ing an Eternity of Torments to &s;uffer even Millions of Ages after the World &s;hall be ended.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="42">

<P>Our Imagination is perfectly Lo&s;t, and our Thoughts are &s;wallowed up, &s;tun'd and confounded, in the View of &s;uch a va&s;t extent of Duration, in&s;omuch that after Millions of Ages as many Times multiplied, unhappy <HI>Onan</HI> will &s;till have his Work to begin, over again, as fre&s;h and as much A new, as the very fir&s;t Moment he entered there, and every Onanian the &s;ame.</P>

<P>When every One that is in <HI>Hell</HI> reflects on this and compares it with the incon&s;iderable Time his Plea|&s;ure, for which he is condemn'd, la&s;ted when he was in this World, what mu&s;t his Rage be?</P>
<P>Where are now tho&s;e great Men, who have for pa&s;t Ages enjoyed all this World could give them?</P>
<P>What are they the better for all their Sen&s;uality, De|bauchery, and Plea&s;ure, if they are Damned?</P>
<P>All Plea&s;ure is now pa&s;t and gone, as if it had never been, but the Soul will FOR EVER BE, and that mi&s;e|rably too, if not prevented by a true Repentance.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Reflections make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon an <HI>Onanian</HI> that reads this; if this Eternity does not touch him, can he call him&s;elf a rational Creature?</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> What the u&s;ual Misfortune is that attends the Sin of Self-Defilement: And how to remedy it.</HEAD>
<P>THE common ill Effect the Habit of this Vice of <HI>Self-Defilement</HI> has on the Body, is to bring Per&s;ons of ei|ther Sex in&s;en&s;ibly into a Gleet, or other &s;uch draining Weakne&s;&s;es as hereafter will be &s;hewn:</P>
<P>Which Di&s;orders are the Fore-runners of various Pains, Aches, and other Ailments about the Body, wa&s;ts the Spi|rits, decays the Strength, cau&s;es particular Pains, and Dizzyne&s;s in the Head, and &s;o wears out the Body, as to bring it in the End into a Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>And what al&s;o is to be much lamented is, that the&s;e Ailments are of &s;uch an <HI>Out of the Way</HI> kind from common Di&s;tempers (to &s;ay nothing of the Shame that attends them, which u&s;ually keeps Per&s;ons from di&s;covering their Condition to another in order to obtain a Cure) that the be&s;t Phy&s;icians are oftentimes puzled with them.</P>
<P>And for the&s;e Rea&s;ons it is, that &s;o many unhappy Per|&s;ons are daily ruined, and their Con&s;titutions utterly Broke and &s;poiled by the&s;e Sort of Gleets and Weakne&s;&s;es, cau&s;ed by this wretched Sin of <HI>Self-Defilement,</HI> for want of the right and proper Method of curing them.</P>
<P>As then a great many Per&s;ons will doubtle&s;s read this Book in Hopes of Relief from it, the next thing to be con&s;idered &s;hall be, of the mo&s;t rational Method of Cure, according to the Principles of Anatomy and Phy&s;ick, of the&s;e Gleets and draining Weakne&s;&s;es in either Sex, con&s;equent from, and cau&s;ed by a Habit of this Vice.</P>
<P>And which cannot fail of being very acceptable to eve|ry Reader labouring under them, becau&s;e, there is no Treati&s;e hitherto extant, that has &s;o treated of this Mat|ter, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t Per&s;ons &s;atisfactorily in their Cure.</P>
<P>But as to be able to cure a Di&s;temper, there mu&s;t be a perfect Knowledge had of its Cau&s;e (or el&s;e 'tis only gue&s;s Work, and acting in the Dark) <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ays <HI>Hippocrates, He that knows be&s;t the Cau&s;e of an All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">+ment or Di&s;temper, is the mo&s;t likely Per&s;on Be&s;t to cure it,</HI> which made that great Phy&s;ician <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> afterwards &s;ay, That <HI>Recte curaturum quem prima Origo cau&s;oe non fefellerit.</HI></P>

<P>BY a <HI>Gleet,</HI> or other &s;uch draining Weakne&s;s, which <HI>Onanians</HI> have by their wicked Practice drawn upon them&s;elves, is here under&s;tood an <HI>Involuntary</HI> and almo&s;t con&s;tant Efflux or <HI>Dripping</HI> away of Matter from a human Body, and that in much the &s;ame Quantity, whether the Per&s;on be a&s;leep or awake, this Gleet being of ju&s;t the &s;ame Kind as any other Gleet following any ill Di|&s;temper, &s;uch as the <HI>Secret Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> and its Cure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From this Definition it naturally offers it &s;elf to our Con&s;ideration, to enquire into the Cau&s;e of this Efflux or Coming away of Matter, and How it happens that &s;uch a Quantity of it &s;hould thus involuntarily come away.</P>
<P>Which Difficulty will ea&s;ily be removed by examining ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="4 letters">ard Anatomical Structure and <HI>Make</HI> of that particu|lar Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> where this Weakne&s;s is &s;ituated, which is the only Thing that can give Light to our pre&s;ent Que&s;tion:</P>
<P>And then to examin, if there is naturally any Liquor &s;eparated in that Part, capable of becoming the Matter of that Epidemical Weakne&s;s and common Companion of Per&s;ons habituated to this Vice, u&s;ually called a <HI>Gleet.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable by Anatomy, that in the Nervo-Spongi|ous Sub&s;tance of the Urethra or Urinary Pa&s;&s;age, there are &s;everal Glandulous Openings, like &s;o many little Pin-holes, fir&s;t di&s;covered by that great Anatomi&s;t Mr. <HI>Cowper,</HI> which &s;erve as &s;o many excretory Ducts or Channels de&s;igned by Nature con&s;tantly to convey and furni&s;h a certain vi&s;cid, clammy, mucous Kind of Liquor or Moi&s;ture into the Uri|nary Pa&s;&s;age; the U&s;e of which Liquor is to lubricate and be&s;mear by its Vi&s;cidity the Pipe or Pa&s;&s;age, and thereby to pre&s;erve and defend it from being fretted and corroded by the &s;harp Salts of the Urine which is daily pa&s;&s;ing thro it, and which, without this defen&s;ative Liquor would cer|tainly be fretted, and become raw, and by con&s;equence,
<PB N="35" REF="48">Sore as any fle&s;hy Part would be, that &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;alt &s;harp fretting Liquor as Urine &s;o often pa&s;&s;ing over it, unle&s;s it were pre&s;erved by &s;ome &s;uch proper Defen&s;ative, as the continual anointing or be&s;mearing it with &s;ome &s;uch &s;mooth, &s;oft, unctuous Sub&s;tance would be:</P>
<P>In&s;omuch that were it not for this Slimy Liquor or Moi&s;ture that Nature is continually &s;upplying the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age with, by means of tho&s;e glandulous Openings ju&s;t now mentioned, to keep it thus moi&s;t, it wou'd in a lit|tle Time become &s;o fretted and raw, by the Sharpne&s;s of the Urine daily pa&s;&s;ing thro' it, that <HI>All Mankind in general would have a perpetual Scalding and Heat of Urine upon them.</HI></P>
<P>By which is not here meant, that the Urine in it &s;elf would be hotter in that Suppo&s;ition, than it is now, but that the Pa&s;&s;age being raw and &s;ore for want of that de|fen&s;ative &s;limy Moi&s;ture which now protects it, it would be fretted by the Saltne&s;s of the Urine, and &s;o would &s;mart, and &s;eem as it were to Burn and Scald, whenever the Urine pa&s;&s;ed through it: Ju&s;t as any other raw &s;ore Place dive&s;ted of its Scarf-Skin, wou'd &s;mart and &s;eem to burn, if one &s;hou'd throw Urine or &s;alt Water upon it.</P>
<P>This being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed from the nice <HI>Anatomical In|&s;pection</HI> of the inward <HI>Structure</HI> and <HI>Make</HI> of the Urethra,</P>
<P>We are next to con&s;ider what Changes and Alterations the&s;e glandulous Openings in the Pa&s;&s;age, are &s;ubject to, and capable of: And then, whether or no &s;uch <HI>Changes</HI> can furni&s;h us with &s;uch a large Supply of Matter as is experienced <HI>Involuntarily</HI> to drip away from Per&s;ons who have that Weakne&s;s commonly called a <HI>Gleet</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>Our next Endeavour then mu&s;t be to examin How the Urethra only and the glandulous Openings above-men|tion'd which it contains, are able to furni&s;h &s;o great a Quantity of Matter, as is ob&s;erv'd to be <HI>involuntarily</HI> di&s;|charged in the Cour&s;e of any Sore of <HI>Gleet.</HI></P>
<P>In order to which we mu&s;t con&s;ider, That Nature de|&s;igning the&s;e Glands in the Urethra con&s;tantly to furni&s;h and &s;upply a certain Moi&s;ture to the whole Pipe or Pa&s;&s;age, which may defend it from being fretted by the &s;harp Urine &s;o frequently pa&s;&s;ing through it, as has been already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hewed, the Orifices or Mouths of the&s;e Glands in entire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ealthy, &s;ound, hail Per&s;ons, are in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, (to u&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he Compari&s;on, <HI>&s;ervata</HI> always <HI>debit&acirc; proportione</HI>) like the Sphincter Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Anus, Bladder,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>By which is meant, that the Openings of the&s;e Glands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">otwith&s;tanding their being &s;o very &s;mall, have a certain Springine&s;s and Ela&s;ticity proportionable to their Bigne&s;s,
<PB N="36" REF="49">and Size, belonging to them, by which they are endow|ed with a certain Power of &s;traitning, contracting, and drawing them&s;elves together, more or le&s;s, upon every Emi&s;&s;ion of that abovementioned Moi&s;ture Nature de&s;igns them to &s;upply the Urethra with: Ju&s;t as the Sphincter Mu&s;cle of the Bladder is endowed with a Power of re|taining, holding, and keeping in the Urine.</P>
<P>And by this Means it is, that &s;o much and no more of this Moi&s;ture is thrown out of the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lands into the Ure|thra, than is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the lubricating and moi&s;ten|ing it, preparatively for the Pa&s;&s;age of the Urine.</P>
<P>So that as by rea&s;on of the Strength and Vigour of the Sphincter-Mu&s;cle, for Example of the Bladder, the Neck and Mouth of it is endowed with a Power of &s;traitening, contracting and clo&s;ing it &s;elf together after every Emi&s;&s;i|on of Urine, every one experiences in them&s;elves a Pow|er of either Holding, or letting go their Water:</P>
<P>So, much in the &s;ame manner, by Rea&s;on of the Strength and Vigour of the Orifices of the&s;e Glandules, they are endowed with a not unlike Power of &s;traitening, con|tracting, and drawing them&s;elves together (which the Rea|der is de&s;ired always to &s;uppo&s;e to be in a Degree propor|tionable to their Bigne&s;s) after every Emi&s;&s;ion of the mu|cous &s;limy Liquor they contain:</P>
<P>Which Strength being once lo&s;t, the Power of retain|ing and keeping in this Liquor is al&s;o lo&s;t with it</P>
<P>The State then and Condition of the&s;e glandulous Open|ings (or as Dr. <HI>Drake</HI> calls them, <HI>Mucous Glands,</HI> from their thus furni&s;hing and &s;upplying the Pa&s;&s;age with this <HI>Mucous</HI> &s;limy Liquor,) being thus con&s;idered in healthy Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Our next Enquiry mu&s;t be into the State of them in Per&s;ons afflicted with a <HI>Gleet,</HI> or other &s;uch draining <HI>Weak|ne&s;s,</HI> after a vicious Habit of this Sin, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Which State we &s;hall &s;oon be appri&s;ed of, by con&s;ider|ing that when a Per&s;on has been addicted to this Vice, by a frequent Pre&s;&s;ure upon, and a violent, and <HI>Unnatural U&s;e,</HI> Forcing, and Irritation of the&s;e Glands, by the abo|minable Act of this Sin, this <HI>Unnatural Forcing</HI> Practice has render'd them flaccid, limber, weak, and loo&s;e, which before were healthy, vigorous, &s;pringy, and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The Truth of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions) ab&s;tracting from the Rea&s;onablene&s;s they carry along with them) will appear by giving an Account of the State of the&s;e Glands as they have been ob&s;erved in &s;ome Anatomical Di&s;&s;ections made of that particular Part, where all <HI>Gleets</HI> are &s;eated that is, the Urethra or Urinary Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="50">
<P>That great Anatomi&s;t Mr. <HI>Cowper</HI> tells us, that to inform him&s;elf the better in this Point, he di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ected the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age of &s;everal Criminals: Some of which were heal|thy &s;ound Per&s;ons: The others were executed with <HI>Gleets</HI> upon 'em, having been lu&s;tful libidinous wicked <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>In the healthy found Per&s;ons he found the&s;e glandu|lous <HI>Openings</HI> to be &s;o firm, as to have had <HI>even</HI> a perfect Ela&s;ticity, or Springine&s;s belonging to them:</P>
<P>In&s;omuch that upon pre&s;&s;ing them, <HI>(but not without this Pre&s;&s;ure)</HI> he &s;ays, they di&s;charg'd a certain Quantity of tran&s;parent vi&s;cous &s;limy Liquor, &s;uch as it &s;hews it &s;elf, and ought to be in <HI>&s;tatu &s;ano;</HI> whereas if the&s;e Glands had not had &s;uch a Firmne&s;s and Strength, in which con&s;i&s;ted their Power of retaining or letting go the vi&s;|cid &s;limy Liquor they contain; this Liquor would have &s;lipped out of them without any &s;uch Pre&s;&s;ure at all:</P>
<P>And by con&s;equence, its not owzing out, but upon &s;uch a Pre&s;&s;ure, was an evident Mark of their Springine&s;s and Strength. He al&s;o ob&s;erv'd the whole Urethra to be be&s;meared and lined with a vi&s;cous, &s;limy, unctuous Moi|&s;ture, which was di&s;charged from the&s;e <HI>Glaudulous</HI> Open|ings or little Bags in order to lubricate the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But in the Urethra of tho&s;e Criminals executed with a <HI>Gleet</HI> upon them, the Ca&s;e was quite different:</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved the mucous <HI>Glands</HI> all along the <HI>Urinary Pa&s;&s;age</HI> to be limber, flaccid, flabby, and loo&s;e, very much &s;tretch|ed, and dilated, and their Orifices by the Help of a a nice Micro&s;cope to be vi&s;ibly open, &s;tretched, dilated, and di&s;tended, and thereby totally de&s;titute of their Strength and Vigour; from whence he concluded, that they were al&s;o entirely deprived of their retentive Facul|ty and Springyne&s;s, having no Power left of contracting them&s;elves upon any emi&s;&s;ion of that mucous &s;limy Liquor they contain, as tho&s;e other Glands could do in the Crimi|nals that were executed in perfect Health.</P>
<P>This will appear &s;till more clear, by an Example of Per&s;ons who have a <HI>Diabetes</HI> upon them:</P>
<P>For, from the Lo&s;s of the Springine&s;s and Tone of the Sphincter Mu&s;cle of the Bladder, the Neck, and mouth of it is &s;o weakned and relaxed, as to be deprived of its re|tentive Faculty, thro' a want of that Power of contracting and drawing it &s;elf together after any Emi&s;&s;ion of Urine, which healthy Per&s;ons experience in them&s;elves:</P>
<P>From whence it follows, that the Urine comes away in|voluntarily from them, being altogether deprived of both that expul&s;ive, as well as retentive Power which healthy Per&s;ons have.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> How the abovementioned Weakne&s;s of the Mu|cous Glands, and their Orifices in the Urethra, are the only Cau&s;e of all Sorts of Gleets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Springine&s;s and retentive Faculty of the mucous Glands in the Urethra of healthy found Per&s;ons con|&s;i&s;ting in their Strength and Power of either dilating or contracting their Orifices or <HI>O&s;tiola,</HI> (as in the foregoing Chapter has been &s;hewed) by which Power of retaining or letting out the vi&s;cous &s;limy Moi&s;ture they contain, they di&s;charge ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of it, than is ju&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the lubricating and be&s;mearing the Pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<P>It mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity follow, that when the&s;e Glands are, by a violent and unnatural Straining and Forceing of them by the vicious Habit of <HI>Self-Defilement,</HI> &s;o weakened as to become limber, flaccid, flabby, and loo&s;e, they mu&s;t be de|prived of this retentive Power or Faculty al&s;o.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch that altho the&s;e Glands in healthy &s;ound Per&s;ons, are naturally &s;o Springy and Strong, as to di&s;|charge and let out into the Urethra, ju&s;t &s;o much and no more of the &s;limy Liquor de&s;igned by Nature to be&s;mear, and as it were to Cover over the whole Tube or Pa&s;&s;age, and thereby defend it from the Sharpne&s;s of the Urine:</P>
<P>Yet in Per&s;ons who have a Gleet or other &s;uch Weakne&s;s upon them from this vicious Practice, the Ca&s;e is not &s;o:</P>
<P>For the Offices or <HI>O&s;tiola</HI> of the&s;e Glands in the&s;e Per|&s;ons are &s;o weakened and relaxed by the Violence, and repeated <HI>Unnatural Forceing</HI> of them, as to be in a Manner always open, by which Means the mucous Liquor they contain, is continually &s;lipping out of them into the Urethra; the Openings of the&s;e Glands not having Sprin|gine&s;s, nor Strength le&s;t to contract them&s;elves, and thereby to keep it in, as formerly they could.</P>
<P>By which Means the contained Liquor involuntarily and continually comes out into the Urethra, and by &s;u|ce&s;&s;ive Quantities of it pu&s;hing one after another, thus drips and ownes away <HI>Involuntarily</HI> from the Body.</P>
<P>The Difficulty then that now remains, is to conceive how &s;uch very &s;mall Glands and their Orifices can furni&s;h &s;uch a Quantity of Matter, as is daily experienced to flow away in &s;ome <HI>Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ets,</HI> and how the mucous Liquor which naturally is di&s;charged our of the&s;e Glands into the Ure|thra in healthy Per&s;ons, &s;hould be increa&s;ed to &s;uch a De|gree, as it is in Per&s;ons who have a Gleet.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="52">
<P>To Clear this Matter, it cannot but be allow'd, that the&s;e mucous Glands, as little as they are, may natural|ly di&s;charge into the Urethra for its Lubrication as much of this Liquor in one Minute as may weigh at lea&s;t one quarter of a Grain: This in an Hour will be 15 Grains, or a quarter of a Dram: In 24 Hours, or a Natural Day, it will amount to 6 Drams, which is 3 Quarters of an Ounce; a Quantity &s;ufficient in all Rea&s;on to give that Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Per&s;on, as well as Wetne&s;s to the Lin|nen, which is u&s;ually experienced by tho&s;e under die un|comfortable Circum&s;tances of a <HI>Gleet</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>If you ask, how the&s;e Glands in the Urethra can di&s;|charge &s;o great a Quantity of Fluid, in the Time of a <HI>Gleet,</HI> above what they do in their natural State.</P>
<P>The An&s;wer is, that it is manife&s;t from the Animal OEconomy, that if any Gland or excretory Duct be weak|ened, and deprived of its retentive Faculty, the Quantity of Liquor that it di&s;charges by Rea&s;on of chat Weakne&s;s, is con&s;iderably augmented in Proportion to the Degree of Weakne&s;s with which the&s;e Glands or Ducts are affected:</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as a little Powder of <HI>Spani&s;h Flies</HI> apply'd any where, by breaking thro the Texture of the Outward Scarf-Skin, does &s;o weaken the Glands as &s;oon to excite a Bli&s;ter, and by its thus weakening the Glands under the Scarf-Skin, makes them di&s;charge a Quantity of Matter im|men&s;ly greater, than what would naturally flow away other|wi&s;e from that Part by in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration only.</P>
<P>Much in the &s;ame Manner, the Orifices of the&s;e Glands being weaken'd and relax'd by the <HI>Unnatural Forcing</HI> Acti|on of this Sin, have thereby lo&s;t their retentive Faculty, and therefore cannot hold in the Liquor they contain, but lets more of it &s;lip away than the mere Lubrication of the Urethra requires, and therefore it continually is di&s;charg|ing it &s;elf by that Dripping commonly called a <HI>Gleet.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the true Origin and Cau&s;e of, not only tho&s;e parti|cular Gleets and Weakne&s;&s;es, which are the Con&s;equences of the vicious Practice of Self Defilement, but al&s;o of any other Gleet, are clearly explicated, without recour&s;e to any other Part, or Parts, that have no Manner of Claim to fall under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, as for Example the <HI>Seminal Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> or the <HI>Pro&s;tatae,</HI> or the <HI>Para&s;tatae</HI> which Terms will be explicated in the Second Volume.</P>
<P>And which Parts having b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">en erroneou&s;ly thought to furni&s;h the Matter of a Gleet&punc; has been the Rea&s;on that the Vulgar &s;o commonly (tho very improperly) call almo&s;t every <HI>Gleet</HI> a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> whereas they are widely different:</P>
<PB N="40" REF="53">
<P>The only Seat of a Gleet, being no other than the mere Urinary Pa&s;&s;age, and not at all farther up in the Body.</P>
<P>Whereas that Efflux of Matter that is really and truly a Gonorrhaea, comes from the Seminal Ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves, as will be clearly &s;hewed in the next Volum</P>
<P>Hence all the Difficulties about a <HI>Gleet,</HI> or other &s;uch draining Weakne&s;s in either Sex, whether proceeding from the vicious Habit of the odious Sin of Self-Defile|ment, or from any ill Di&s;temper, or its Cure (either of the&s;e Gleets being of the &s;ame Nature,) are overcome in a few Words: Its Symptoms become obvious upon a &s;mall Principle &s;o clear in Anatomy, as to carry not only Evi|dence along with it, but al&s;o more clearly explicates all the Symptoms and Effects of it, than hitherto has been done.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gleets then being of ju&s;t the lame Nature, and by con&s;equence to be cured by ju&s;t the &s;ame Method, as other Gleets and Weakne&s;&s;es are, which are contracted by either a former ill Di&s;temper, &s;uch as the <HI>Secret Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> and its Cure in either Sex; but more frequently in Women af|ter hard and difficult Labours, Colds contracted in Lyings|in, Wrenches, Falls, Hurts, Strains, and other &s;uch inno|cent Cau&s;es, as will be hereafter &s;hewed.</P>
