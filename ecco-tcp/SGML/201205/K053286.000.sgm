<P>If any Dirt, Stones, or other Rubbi&s;h is in the Package, which very often happens to the very be&s;t, the Value is uncertain; therefore, what you buy, let it be fine and clear; and if it be not &s;o, &s;ort it in the Country, taking it out of the Skins, and freeing it from Stones, Dirt and Rubbi&s;h; for which, if you import it, you mu&s;t pay the Duty, which is very high, and the
<PB N="2" REF="5">Buyers will calculate the Lo&s;s in Skins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at double the real Di&s;advantage.

Stones, Dirt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be equally guarded again&s;t in this Article as in the Cicotrina, and the Buyer &s;hould guard again&s;t its being wet; very good Epatic Alloes having been brought home from <HI>India</HI> almo&s;t Liquid, which the Buyers were obliged to keep till it became dry and fit to be broke into &s;mall Pieces, and capable of being reduced to Powder</P>

<HEAD>CASSIA LIGNEA.</HEAD>
<P>Is the Bark of the ba&s;tard Cinnamon Tree, There are &s;everal Sorts, but the be&s;t brought home lately was from <HI>China,</HI> which was &s;mall long round Sticks, nearly of the Colour and Flavour of real Cinnamon, and is u&s;ed in its &s;tead. It cannot be too thin, for if the Bark is thick, though it be equally &s;trong and pungent on the Palate, it will only do for di&s;tilling, and therefore not near &s;o valuable.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Sort of Ca&s;&s;ia Lignea is generally got at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Ben. oclen,</HI> and is of two Sorts, one a very &s;mall Twig, about a Foot long, of a &s;tronger pungent Flavour than Cinnamon, and &s;old from &pound;15 to &pound;20 per Cwt. The other Sort is in thick long Sticks, and nearly as pun|gent; but the &s;hape and colour makes it not &s;o valuable, and only &s;ells from &pound;5 to &pound;8 per Cwt.</P>
<P>The way to di&s;cover the true Cinnamon Sort is to chew it, when, if it is mu&s;ilaginous or &s;limy in the mouth, it is not near &s;o valuable, though it is often &s;tronger than real Cinnamon, but will foul the Cinnamon Water made from it. There is al&s;o Ca&s;&s;ia Lignea that is of a very bright Colour and good Shape, which has little or no &s;mell or Ta&s;te; the breaking a handful of Sticks will a&s;certain the Quality almo&s;t as well as ta&s;t|ing, for where there is a fine Smell, there is always a &s;trong Ta&s;te.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="16">

Care &s;hould be taken to pack them in &s;trong &s;ound Che&s;ts, for the lea&s;t damp will turn the Hu&s;k, not only mouldy but mu&s;ty, and greatly reduce its Value.</P>
