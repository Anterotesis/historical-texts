D. Fellow of the <HI>College of Phy&s;icians,</HI> and of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SO great and &s;o ju&s;t is the Fame and Wi&s;|dom of Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton,</HI> that his Appro|bation of any Sub|ject in Phy&s;ick or Philo&s;ophy
<PB N="iv" REF="3">&s;uffices to recommend it to the World, without the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uperadding Arguments, Rea&s;ons, or Experiments, to give it more Credit or Authority: But we have al&s;o the concurring Te&s;ti|mony of another Per&s;on, emi|nent for &s;olid Erudition, Pre&s;i|dent of the <HI>Facultas Medica,</HI> or College of Phy&s;icians. It was in <HI>your Pre&s;ence,</HI> Sirs, and not <HI>in yours alone,</HI> but together with &s;everal Fellows of both the&s;e illu&s;trious Societies, before whom the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters were brought, and have been examin'd by &s;everal Experi|ments, and were ta&s;ted, and by <HI>You</HI> were highly commended for their Strength and grateful Ta&s;te, and promi&s;ing Vertue, and grant|ed, That they did much exceed the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, with which they were compar'd.</P>
<PB N="v" REF="4">
<P>Upon this Approbation of <HI>Yours,</HI> together with my own Experience of the good the&s;e Waters had done to my &s;elf, and al&s;o to &s;everal of my Friends of late and formerly, I thought I had Rea&s;on enough to undertake this Province, of pub|li&s;hing this Account of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this Tract is not to depreciate or undervalue the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters; for they have doubt|le&s;s been of con&s;iderable Benefit to Mankind, and will, I hope, continue to do much good; but yet &s;ince a kind Providence opens a richer or more &s;alubrious Trea|sure of Waters, &s;hall we not thankfully embrace this Gift of God? The <HI>Spa</HI> Waters have had a great Advantage above the&s;e,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">they have been longer and more apply'd to than other Waters of that Kind. Much perhaps may be due to the happy Scituation, and good Accommodation of the Place, which invited and caus'd a more copious and numerous Re&s;ort of rich and populous Neighbouring Nations, &s;uch as <HI>Flanders, Germany, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters lie more North, have been mo&s;t frequented by the <HI>Northern</HI> Inhabitants of <HI>Germany;</HI> and of late Years Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Birth and Quality, even Princes of the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;es of <HI>Hanover</HI> and of <HI>Saxony,</HI> have graced the&s;e Waters with their Pre&s;ence, and have di&s;cern'd their Vertue and good Effects, and have given them a greater Fame than formerly: But <HI>England,</HI> which has been &s;o un|fortunate as to have known no|thing
<PB N="vii" REF="6">of them hitherto, is now like to be &s;upply'd by wi&s;e Me|thods taken to furni&s;h this Coun|try with con&s;iderable Quantity, of the&s;e Waters, at who&s;e Arrival (which is daily expected) their own Vertue will &s;uffice to give them Reputation.</P>
<P>But that I may crown, and give the fini&s;hing Stroke to this Recom|mendation of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, we have the Experience and Exam|ple of our Gracious Sovereign, a Wi&s;e and Judicious Prince, who has cho&s;en and preferr'd the&s;e, be|fore any of that va&s;t Variety of Steel Waters which <HI>Germany</HI> abounds with. You have a lively Evi|dence and Atte&s;tation of the Health-pre&s;erving Vertue of the&s;e Waters, vi&s;ible in his Maje&s;ty's healthful Countenance, who not only the
<PB N="viii" REF="7">la&s;t Year, but in many preceding Years, drank the&s;e cordial and a|nimating Waters. Nor will it di&s;|plea&s;e a Prince endow'd with &s;o much Bounty and Benevolence, to have been a happy Occa&s;ion of recommending this &s;alutiferous Fountain, or Source of Water, to his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects. It was a Pre|&s;ent made by one of his Maje&s;ty's Family, which enabled me to make the &s;everal Tryals and Experi|ments mention'd in this little Trea|ti&s;e. But among&s;t the re&s;t, that which gave me the greate&s;t Sati&s;|faction and Comfort was this, That they could be brought in &s;o great a Perfection, as to contain and carry their Virtue entirely good to us, perhaps, with le&s;s Diminu|tion than a Bottle of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> or old <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI> do bring theirs. And may our mo&s;t Clement and Mer|ciful

<HEAD><HI>AN ACCOUNT OF THE</HI> Nature and Excellent Proper|ties and Virtues of the <HI>Pyr|mont</HI> Waters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_HAVING procured a Quan|tity of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, I made &s;ome Trials with them, both internal and external, by Drinking them, and by other Ex|periments which are here related. By the Ta&s;t I manife&s;tly di&s;covered that they contain'd a rich Chalybeat In|gredient, far exceeding that of the be&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="16"><HI>Spa</HI> Water I ever ta&s;ted: The <HI>Spa</HI> Waters have ju&s;tly the Preference, not only to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Steel Waters, but to all the Foreign Waters that are brought over, which made me compare the&s;e with the <HI>Spa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spa</HI> Waters are then looked upon to be mo&s;t excellent, when they &s;parkle in the Gla&s;s, and give a brisk Ta&s;t to the Palate. The <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters gave this Proof of their Briskne&s;s, as &s;oon as the Cork was opened, and the Air was admitted, did make a notable Ebullition, like bot|tled Cyder, and gave a &s;mart, &s;pirituous, and plea&s;ant Ta&s;t, and continued the brisk and high chalybeat Reli&s;h to the la&s;t Gla&s;s, tho' we were &s;ome Hours about the drinking off a Bottle of Two Quarts.</P>
<P>In Reference to the internal U&s;e of the&s;e Waters, I pro&s;ecuted the fol|lowing Method: I got &s;ome excellent good <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, I drank them for 6 or 7 Days, a Flask at a Time; I then drank the &s;ame Quantity of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water for 4 Days, and afterwards continued the U&s;e of both the&s;e Waters alternately, until I had drank about 20 Days: The Re&s;ult of this Experi|ment
<PB N="3" REF="17">was &s;o plain and manife&s;t to me, that the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters gave me more Spirit and Strength tho&s;e Days I drank them, than when I us'd the others; and I have good Rea&s;on to hope, that many Per&s;ons will confirm this Experience of mine, when they &s;hall be &s;o happy as to obtain the&s;e Waters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water is by the Fo|reign Phy&s;icians reckoned among&s;t the <HI>Acidulae,</HI> or &s;our Wells or Waters; I take the more Notice of this, becau&s;e I gave a Gla&s;s of it to more than one of my Friends, who were &s;urprized at the Quickne&s;s of the Ta&s;t, and called it &s;harp or <HI>acid;</HI> but when I made them drink another Gla&s;s, and con|&s;ider it better, they were forced to re|cant, and confe&s;s that the &s;mart and brisk Ta&s;t had mi&s;led them to call it acid or &s;our. Thus Cyder and &s;oft Ale when bottled, may give a &s;mart and acute Impre&s;&s;ion to the Palate, tho' very far from being &s;our; and even Spirits, or volatile Alkalies of <HI>Sal Armo|niac</HI> or of <HI>Hart&s;horn,</HI> when mixt with Water, do cau&s;e a &s;mart and pungent Affection on the Tongue; which is far from being <HI>acid.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="18">
<P>But to bring this to a yet further Trial, whether an <HI>Acidity</HI> was preva|lent, or &s;o much as to be found in the&s;e Waters, we dropt a good Proportion of Spirit of <HI>Hart&s;horn</HI> and Spirit of <HI>Sal Armoniac</HI> into the&s;e Waters, and did not find the lea&s;t Luctation or Motion appear, as they u&s;ually do with an <HI>acid.</HI></P>
<P>I made a yet more critical and cer|tain Examen of the <HI>Acidity</HI> &s;aid to be found in <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, by mixing them with Milk in various Mea&s;ures and Proportions, and I al&s;o gave vari|ous Degrees of Heat to them, &s;ome were tried in a tepid or lukewarm, o|thers in a boyling Heat, but did not curdle the Milk at all; on the contrary, the Waters pre&s;erved the Milk for 4 or 5 Days from curdling, or being &s;our; which &s;trong <HI>Alkalies</HI> will do in like Manner. The&s;e Experiments do &s;uffi|ciently prove, that our <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters do not contain an <HI>acid.</HI></P>
<P>I often made the&s;e following Experi|ments to prove the chalybeat Proper|ties or Vertues of the&s;e Waters in my own private Room, and &s;hewed them to &s;ome Friends: According to the common way of trying chalybeat Wa|ters,
<PB N="5" REF="19">I put a &s;mall Quantity of pouder'd Gall, about half a Grain or le&s;s, to half a Pint of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, and &s;tirr'd it a|bout &s;o as to make a &s;udden Mixture, and it did in a Moment give a deep Purple Colour; but if you drop the Powder gently on the Surface of the Water, it will make a very fine Blue Tincture, more plea&s;ant to the Spectator, but far from be|ing &s;o curious as the following Tincture.</P>
<P>We took 4 or 5 Leaves of &s;trong Green Tea, placed them in the Bottom of a Gla&s;s, holding a quarter of a Pint, and pouring on the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, and &s;tirred it not at all, we ob&s;erved the&s;e Leaves to unfold them&s;elves, and gra|dually tinge the&s;e Waters with a fine caeruleous azure Blue, few Vegetables do afford the like: Note, that if the&s;e, or any other Stipticks, (which are the Praecipitators) do continue long in the Water, they give a deeper Purple, and even at length an <HI>Atramentarius</HI> Colour.</P>
<P>There is another Property in the&s;e Waters, which makes them more u&s;eful to us than any Foreign Chalybeat Wa|ters we yet know, that is, they do car|ry better, and keep their Vertue long|er, are not &s;o &s;oon &s;poil'd by any acci|dental In&s;inuations of the Air, as <HI>Spa,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="20">and other Iron or Chalybeat Waters are apt to be. The Mineral is here tho|roughly well united and mixt with this Water, &s;o that it does not ea&s;ily precipitate, or &s;eparate from the Water; it carries al&s;o a much greater Quantity of the Steel, or (as &s;ome call it) Vitrio|lic Quality in it; and for the&s;e Rea&s;ons does the better pa&s;s the <HI>Va&s;a Lactea,</HI> and communicate with the Blood it &s;elf, and work the more con&s;iderable Effects.</P>
<P>That the&s;e <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters do hold their Vertue beyond any other we know of, appear'd to me, becau&s;e there was not one of tho&s;e I open'd, (&s;ome of which were kept the whole Winter,) that dimini&s;hed any Thing of the &s;trong Iron or Steel Ta&s;t. Moreover, I made this Experiment; I &s;uffered a Bottle, or Flask of <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, being about half full, to be un&s;topp'd, and expo&s;ed to the Air for 12 Hours; I examined it, and it did neither tinge nor ta&s;t of the Mineral, but was in&s;ipid; but the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, expo&s;ed ju&s;t after the &s;ame Manner, did ta&s;t &s;trong of the Mineral, nay, they continued to do &s;o, and to give the Tincture to Galls for 2 Days, and perhaps might have done &s;o longer, but I thought that &s;uffic'd.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="21">
<P>In Order to the making good, or prov|ing what has been a&s;&s;erted in the Account of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, The&s;e Experiments were made at a full Meeting of the Fellows of the Royal Society, <HI>February</HI> the 28th, 17 16/17. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> Pre&s;ident, being in the Chair.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT I might the better con|vince the worthy Members of the Royal Society, of the promi&s;ing Ex|cellencies and Vertues of the&s;e Waters, (for very few had ever ta&s;ted them be|fore,) I brought a Bottle full of <HI>Pyr|mont</HI> Waters that held above Two Quarts, which I had kept &s;ince <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t; The Weather being very cold, I placed the Bottle &s;o near the Fire, as to give it a little Warmth, or to damask it, as they do to Wine; The Bottle being open'd, the Water immediately made a vi&s;ible Ebullition, but not &s;o much as it did in Summer, and being poured out, did &s;parkle in the Gla&s;s: I pre&s;ented a Gla&s;s of it to the Pre&s;ident, he &s;aid it was highly Chalybeat, and of a brisk and grateful Ta&s;t. Mo&s;t, if not all the Gentlemen pre&s;ent, ta&s;ted the Waters,
<PB N="8" REF="22">did all agree with the Pre&s;ident, That they were a &s;trong Chalybeat, or Steel Water, and of a plea&s;ant Ta&s;t; but a|mong&s;t the re&s;t, Doctor <HI>Douglas,</HI> a learn|ed Phy&s;ician, declared, that his Gla&s;s of Water (which was a good large one) did give a very kind and comfortable Warmth to his Stomach, which made him infer, that it would prove of great U&s;e, and be a notable Stomachick Me|dicine. I often found it to affect my Stomach, much as it did his; but he proves a better Judge, becau&s;e he has avoided drinking Wine for many Years pa&s;t. This being done,</P>
<P N="2">2. I opened a Flask of the be&s;t <HI>Spa</HI> Waters I could get, which being pour'd into the Gla&s;s, was pre&s;ented al&s;o to the Pre&s;ident, but had a very &s;mall and low Ta&s;t of the Chalybeat, (and was judged &s;o not only by him, but the re&s;t who ta&s;ted it) when compared with the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters.</P>
<P N="3">3. I al&s;o demon&s;trated in their Pre&s;ence the Experiments abovementioned, by putting 4 or 5 Leaves of Tea to a Gla&s;s of the&s;e Waters, and about half a Grain of Galls to another, which pre&s;ented them with a curious Blue or Purple
<PB N="9" REF="23">Colour; that with Tea exceeded in Beauty the other.</P>
<P>In Reference to the Experiment a|bovementioned, as to the way of pre|&s;erving the&s;e Waters, it is now perform|ed to more Advantage after this Man|ner: I fill'd a Pint Bottle of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters out of my great Bottle, which being well &s;topp'd, was put into the Cu&s;tody of the Curator, who brought it forth the next Meeting, being full 7 Days, and then was found to hold a &s;trong Chalybeat Ta&s;t, and did tinge with Galls. It will prove a hard Mat|ter to make the <HI>Spa</HI> Water hold 7 Hours after this way of Management; So that on this Account the&s;e Waters have &s;ome con&s;iderable Advantage, becau&s;e many Per&s;ons cannot drink above half a Flask at a Time of the <HI>Spa</HI> Water, by the next Morning the Remainder does lo&s;e all its Vertue, and will ta&s;t much like common Water.</P>

<P>At the reading my fir&s;t Account which I gave of the Vertue of the <HI>Py|mour</HI> Waters, it was di&s;cour&s;ed and ar|gued, that they contain'd a purging
<PB N="11" REF="25">Quality in them, which is not only a&s;&s;erted by Authors, but even by tho&s;e that have actually drank them, who have po&s;itively a&s;&s;ur'd me, that they did purge them. For my Part, I much que&s;tioned this general Effect of any Chalybeat Water, and &s;o &s;oon as I drank them my &s;elf, I found th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> con|trary, which was more agreeable to the &s;everal Sorts of Steel Waters, who&s;e Nature and Properties I have examin'd, and are Printed by Sir <HI>Hans Sloan,</HI> in, the Tran&s;actions. See<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 28. p. 247</NOTE></P>
<P>Now to bring this to a fair Trial, whether any purging Ingredient can be found in the&s;e Waters, I made this Experiment.</P>
<P>I evaporated a Quart of the&s;e Waters <HI>ad &s;iccitatem,</HI> and then poured upon this Remainder &s;ome Rain Water, enough to di&s;&s;olve and take up the Salts; and then having filter'd this Solution, I then by a moderate Heat exhal'd the Water, which contain'd about 4 Grains of a bracki&s;h Salt, more like Sea Salt, than that of the purging Waters. We may &s;afely conclude, that &s;o &s;mall a Quan|tity
<PB N="12" REF="26">of Salt in a Quart of Water, can by no Means be imagined to cau&s;e the lea&s;t Purgation, no not in an Infant; For &s;ince we have &s;eparated the Salts out of the Purging Waters, and brought them into common Practice, we do find by Experience, that 2 Drams, or 120 Grains, di&s;&s;olved in a Quart of com|mon Water, purges very little; and that a whole Ounce of the true genuine Salts, is but a u&s;ual Do&s;e.</P>
<P>I have made it more than probable, in a former Examen of Steel Waters;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> for</HI> 1713. p. 249.</NOTE> That Chalybeat Waters do contain &s;tiptic and re&s;tringent Qualities in them, and that they are derived from Iron Minerals, and more particularly the Pyrites, which Doctor <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts, (not without Rea&s;on) to be the Parent of all Iron Oar. I have often examin'd at <HI>Deptford</HI> the Solution of the Pyrites by Rain Water, out of which Copperas or Vitriol is made, and found it to be a very &s;trong Chalybeat Water: From this Mineral of Iron we have our &s;trong &s;tiptic Powders and Waters to &s;top Bleedings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for external and inter|nal
<PB N="13" REF="27">U&s;e. A judicious U&s;e of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> and <HI>Spa</HI> Waters hath cured ob&s;tinate and inveterate Diarraeas, which did not yield to the Force of all other Medi|cines.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding our arguing to the contrary, it will De retorted upon us, that there is Matter of Fact and Experience again&s;t us, <HI>that they really do purge at</HI> Pyrmont, where they are drank: This Effect I &s;oon conjectured to be due to &s;ome irregular, or immoderate U&s;e of the&s;e Waters; for I found above Thirty Years pa&s;t, the &s;ame Effect at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> on tho&s;e that drank the Wa|ters ha&s;tily and in profu&s;e Quantities; they cau&s;ed Giddine&s;s, Sickne&s;s, Vomit|ings, and Purgings; but &s;ince our Phy|&s;icians have corrected the&s;e Irregula|rities, we hear of no &s;uch Complaint; for all agree that the&s;e Waters are bind|ing, and oft require opening Medicines. Now I am well informed at <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> that they are ordered to drink large Quantities, oft three or four Quarts or more of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure, and that pretty ha&s;tily; which makes it no Won|der that their Weight pre&s;&s;es and forces them thorough the Bowels, becau&s;e a much le&s;s Quantity of Rain, Pump, or
<PB N="14" REF="28">Spring Water, do purge of them&s;elves, as I have experienced in my &s;elf a few Days pa&s;t for the Cure of a <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> two Quarts being drank ha&s;tily gave me about &s;ix Dejections; whereas if you drink the&s;e or any Chalybeat Waters lei&s;urely, and in ju&s;t Quantities, they will pa&s;s off as they &s;hould, by Urine only. And herein lies the Intention and great U&s;e of the&s;e altering Waters, which is to temper and meliorate the State of the Blood, for they ought to prove a Cordial, and give Strength to the weak and depre&s;&s;ed Spirits; but if they chance to purge, the Patient will &s;oon complain that he lo&s;es Ground, and mu&s;t u&s;e Means to check any Di|arraea, and to make the Waters go the right way by Urine, which he then finds will do him good, and produce the de&s;ired Effect.</P>
<P>I am informed by a learned Phy&s;ician, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Archiater to our Sovereign, That it &s;eemed &s;trange to &s;everal of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water Drinkers of his Ac|quaintance at Court, that any one &s;hould doubt of the purging Quality of tho&s;e Waters: I have my &s;elf al&s;o been told by more than one Phy&s;ician, that have been there upon the Place,
<PB N="15" REF="29">That if they do not purge with us here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hey mu&s;t have lo&s;t that Quality by Carriage.

The la&s;t named Dr. <HI>Grew,</HI> an ancient and early Fellow
<PB N="16" REF="30">of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> has u&s;hered this Medicine into the World, by bringing it into a dry Salt; and recommending it into the <HI>Materia Media,</HI> which is now of great U&s;e to Mankind, is carried into remote Countries, even to the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies,</HI> is the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t general Purge of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>This premis'd, I have hinted above, that a Quart of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water has very little real Salt of any Kind, not enough to purge a Sparrow, and has little or none at all of the Purging Cathartick Salt to be found in it, &s;o that it cannot purge, no, not even when drawn fre&s;h out of the Well, and drank rationally, that is, mo|derately: Nor is the Argument of any Validity, that it lo&s;es its purging Fa|culty by Carriage; becau&s;e the purging Salt is a fixt Salt, and will carry as far as the <HI>Indies,</HI> as well as Salt Petre, or our common Kitchin Salt will do; nay, will carry all the World over, and lo&s;e nothing of its Vertue, though it be ex|po&s;ed to -the open Air, or di&s;&s;olv'd in Water, being dried up it recovers a|gain.</P>
<P>If I may be any tolerable Judge my &s;elf, who am ea&s;ily wrought upon by any Lenitives, I do vouch, that the
<PB N="17" REF="31"><HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters have no laxative Ope|ration at all on me. The &s;ame Ac|count I have from a learned Divine, who a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he found no purg|ing Quality in the U&s;e of them; We both drank them the la&s;t Year. I do farther venture to progno&s;tick, (and to my great Satisfaction of their greater Vertue) That they will not purge them who &s;hall drink a Flask of the&s;e Wa|ters, containing the Quantity of a <HI>Spa</HI> Flask; nay, I may venture to &s;ay, two of tho&s;e Flasks, if not drank ha&s;tily, nor with too much Motion.</P>
<P>Since I am upon the Topick of Purg|ing, and we are mighty apt among&s;t us, I mean the Ignorant, to talk much of carrying off &s;ome Reliques of Di&s;ea&s;|es, perhaps of Fevers; which, I fear, are oft done precipitantly, and do bring on Relap&s;es. This brings to my Mind the Practice at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for about 40 Years pa&s;t, when I frequented tho&s;e Waters, That they did not only pre|pare the Patient by Purges, for his Cour&s;e of Drinking, which was very convenient, but they did give &s;trong Purges at the Conclu&s;ion of their Drink|ing. That &s;agacious and con&s;idering Phy&s;ician, Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> (in who&s;e Fa|vour
<PB N="18" REF="32">I had &s;ome Intere&s;t) charg'd me to have a Care of being mi&s;led into that Errour; a&s;&s;uring me, That this Practice would de&s;troy and carry off all the Strength and Vertue the Patient gain'd in a Month's Drinking. He gave me a parallel In&s;tance in the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark, which &s;u&s;tain'd the &s;ame Damage by Purging, and it is di&s;allowed of every where by the Skilful; and yet we have in both the&s;e Ca&s;es, &s;ome very ignorant, but confident Pretenders to Phy&s;ick, who aver, That the Bark, as well as Steel Waters, do leave behind them malignant and dangerous Quali|ties, if not carried off by Purging Me|dicines: Which Practice is generally laid a&s;ide by the Learned Phy&s;icians in <HI>England,</HI> and I hope in other Countries.</P>
<P>There is one Method al&s;o has been made U&s;e of at <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> and other of the Mineral Waters, which to me &s;eems erroneous and dangerous, and ought to be con&s;ider'd and examin'd, whether it does not cau&s;e &s;ome very bad Effects, and that is, as I am told, the Phy&s;icians do order their Patients, with their Bel|lies full of Water, to walk up and down ha&s;tily, and to be&s;tir them&s;elves very nimbly: And I am al&s;o told from very
<PB N="19" REF="33">good Authority, That it is common to forbid &s;uch the U&s;e of the Waters, who through Lamene&s;s, or other Impedi|ments, are di&s;abled from Action or nimble Motion: But in <HI>England</HI> we often find the contrary Method nece&s;&s;a|ry, e&s;pecially in tender and infirm Con|&s;titutions, in whom the Operations of Medicines are mo&s;t con&s;picuous and di&s;tingui&s;h'd, for the&s;e do feel the good Effects of being very &s;till and &s;edate, of being quiet both in Body and Mind: Of this the late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was an e|minent In&s;tance, who could never drink <HI>Tunbridge, Bath,</HI> or any other Di|uretick Waters, but in her Bed; which has been the Ca&s;e of many others of my own Friends, with whom they would not agree, nor pa&s;s off, if they walk'd with them, or took them in any other Po&s;ture than lying. I am far from pre|&s;cribing this Way promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and to all Sorts of People, doubtle&s;s mode|rate walking may agree with many; I have known where riding, after the Waters have been pretty well gone off, has done no Harm; but I found in my &s;elf, when young and &s;trong, very ill Effects in Riding too &s;oon after I had drank a Quantity of Mineral Waters,
<PB N="20" REF="34">that my Legs &s;well'd, and an <HI>Ery&s;ipelas</HI> attended that Swelling.</P>
<P>An Anatomi&s;t, who well con&s;iders, that the Waters mu&s;t circulate through the Heart with the Blood, and from thence up and down through an Abun|dance of a&s;cending as well as de&s;cending Windings and Turnings, he will &s;ay, that the upright or erect Po&s;ture will appear le&s;s likely to facilitate the Cir|culation of the Blood, now loaded with Water, than the Horizontal Po&s;ture of lying on a Couch or a Bed does: Experi|ence it &s;elf confirms the Truth of this, not only of my own, but of many other Water-Drinkers, of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> as well as of the <HI>Bath,</HI> &amp;c. who&s;e Waters have not pa&s;s'd to any Degree in the Day|time, but the&s;e have gone off very plen|tifully at Night in their Beds. I have for many Years pa&s;t recommended a large Gla&s;s of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters to my Friends, to be con&s;tantly taken in their Beds every Night; for which Draught I have had the Thanks of many, but never heard of any Harm received.</P>
<P>As a farther Argument again&s;t much Morion, when we drink the Chalybeat Waters, (e&s;pecially &s;ince they are gene|rally us'd in hot Weather) we mu&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="35">avoid all Methods that provoke Sweat, or di&s;po&s;e us to a quick Per&s;piration through the cutaneous Glands, which we plainly feel and ob&s;erve to be cau&s;ed by much Agitation or Walking, and by that Means the Current of the Wa|ters is diverted from its natural and proper Channel, and hinder'd from pa&s;|&s;ing by Urine, which ought to be in|couraged.</P>
<P>I now appeal to the Judgment of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and learned Per&s;ons of this Honourable Society, who have been the Authors of &s;o much Good to Mankind; whether the&s;e Arguments for regulating the U&s;e of the&s;e noble medical Waters, have not &s;ome Weight, and may not de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd, and not con|demn'd untry'd: This I am &s;ure, that this Method is no wi&s;e hazardous to the Lives of Men; whereas the great Weight and Load of Water in the Blood, (for all Per&s;ons cannot throw them off <HI>per Sedem</HI>) mu&s;t needs produce &s;ome ill Effects. The great Quantity may too much extend and &s;poil the Stomach, may cau&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es of the Head, Vertigo's, Apoplexies, break down the Lymphaeducts, and make an <HI>A&s;citis,</HI> the wor&s;t of Drop&s;ies; and cau&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="36">tho&s;e very Di&s;ea&s;es, which a moderate U&s;e would certainly cure.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be looked upon as an Omi&s;&s;ion, for having taken no mow Notice of the fixed Parts, or of the Ingredients which are to be found in all Chalybeat Waters, and therefore in the <HI>Pyrmont.</HI> For I mention only a &s;mall Quantity of Water evaporated <HI>ad &s;iccitatem,</HI> and I have made U&s;e only of the watry Element to di&s;&s;olve the Salts, and examine their Figure and Ta&s;t, that I might reduce them to their pro|per Species of Salts. As to the Salts, I never fail'd of a <HI>Sal Marine,</HI> but found it in all Sorts of Mineral Waters, (tho' in &s;ome in very &s;mall Quantity,) which is not to be wondred at, &s;ince 'tis very probable, that our Fountains and Wells may owe their Original to the Sea; and &s;o may not altogether &s;train off all, and clear them&s;elves, by Tran&s;cola|tion through the Earth, of every &s;aline Particle. Moreover, the Earth it &s;elf does not only furni&s;h whole Hills or Rocks of Salt, but has &s;maller Veins, and even Grains of Salt &s;catter'd up and down, which are again ab&s;orb'd by &s;mall Rivulets, or Currents of Water, and do in more or le&s;s Quantity impreg|nate
<PB N="23" REF="37">&s;tagnating Wells, or flowing Foun|tains.</P>
<P>I have indeed formerly examin'd the Remains or fixt Parts of many of our ferruginous Waters; I have generally found them much the &s;ame, for all of them do contain Iron Particles; but tho&s;e that abounded mo&s;t with Sedi|ment, held a crude gro&s;s Ocre, and would give the deepe&s;t and blacke&s;t Tincture to the Water, and had the lea&s;t Vertue in them. The Chymi&s;t having collected a good deal of this Sub&s;tance, makes it pa&s;s through many a fiery Trial by Calcination, Reverbe|ration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at length he brings forth a Powder of a Reddi&s;h or deep Yellow, and &s;hall adorn it with a fine Name, perhaps he will call it a <HI>Crocus Martis,</HI> or a Saffron of Steel; (this Name he borrows from one of our mo&s;t excel|lent Vegetables, <HI>Saffron,</HI>) or el&s;e his Fancy &s;hall run upon another Notion, and &s;hall call it a <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Mars;</HI> and not re&s;t here, but endeavour to make up the Three Chymical Principles, namely, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; he will call it Sulphur, though it be in|combu&s;tible; it mu&s;t be a Salt, though it be undi&s;&s;olvable; and a Mercury,
<PB N="24" REF="38">although it look like a Gravel Stone. To what Purpo&s;e all this Labour and Pains? whereas,</P>
<P N="1">1. The very Ta&s;t tells us, that the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters are impregnated with Cha|lybeat or Iron Particles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Eyes will tell us, that we may &s;ee Iron in the&s;e Waters to a Demon|&s;tration; if you put a little Powder or Solution of Galls to the&s;e Waters, it gives a black Colour, and will make Ink. Now &s;ince we have in <HI>England</HI> not any one Thing that gives a black Colour, or is dyed black, but what comes from Iron; none will doubt at fir&s;t Sight of this Experiment, whether the Waters do belong to the Iron Ori|ginal or no. In <HI>England</HI> we abound much with the <HI>Pyrites,</HI> or Copperas Stone, out of this we make great Quan|tity of this Copperas, which is almo&s;t all Iron. The Dyers make U&s;e of it to give the black to Woollen, Linen, Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by boiling it in Water with Galls, and without it we can't give a good black to one Yard of Cloth.</P>
<P>To me the&s;e two ea&s;y and &s;en&s;ible Experiments, made with little Co&s;t and Trouble, do as plainly exhibit the Iron Quality, as if I had evaporated &s;ome
<PB N="25" REF="39">Gallons of the&s;e Waters, and had pa&s;|&s;ed the Recrements through Chymical Fires, and had with a Load&s;tone (as I have done formerly in the like Ca&s;e) taken up the very Sub&s;tance of Iron.</P>
<P>But after all the&s;e pompous and ela|borate Experiments, by which we pre|tend to examine and analize the&s;e ex|cellent Waters, we mu&s;t return to the Waters them&s;elves, who&s;e Vertue lies in their <HI>Synthe&s;i,</HI> or natural Con&s;titution in the Form of Waters: As &s;uch, let us endeavour to make them as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible; for without all doubt, they do contain Medicines adapted to the Cure of many Di&s;ea&s;es, which will &s;uc|ceed more effectually, if the Phy&s;icians, e&s;pecially he that practi&s;es at the Foun|tain Head, do abound in Piety and Charity.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let him not di&s;parage the mu|nificent Author of this great Medicine, for its not being made by the Hands of proud or weak Man: Let him not &s;ay, as &s;ome Wretches have done, that the&s;e Waters are only a good Vehicle for his own wi&s;er and better Compo&s;iti|ons; but rather let him a&s;cribe to the
<PB N="26" REF="40">great Founder of the&s;e noble Medicines, the due Tribute of Thanks and Prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let his Charity be expre&s;&s;ed to his Neighbour, by applying the&s;e Waters with the utmo&s;t Care and Skill he can, by giving them after a due Manner, in ju&s;t Proportion and Quantity, and not pour into the Stomach whole Deluges of Water, to break down Nature's Boundaries; but &s;etting a&s;ide all Prejudi|ces and Self-Ends, let him regard what Symptoms they be&s;t relieve, and what &s;tubborn Di&s;ea&s;es they mo&s;t effectually cure. Let him not, from a vain and ambitious Conceit, pretend to improve the&s;e Waters, by adding &s;ome Chymi|cal Drops or Fancies of his own; for the&s;e often give a nau&s;eous Ta&s;t to the grateful Waters, and may not only de|fraud the Drinker of his plea&s;ant Draught, but al&s;o of the &s;uperiour Vertue inhe|rent in the Waters them&s;elves. This Method is too much practis'd among&s;t us, and often injuriou&s;ly, and de&s;erves to be cen&s;ured.</P>

By them the latent Seeds of many Di&s;|ea&s;es fixt in the Organisk Parts, &s;uch as the mo&s;t &s;agacious Phy&s;ician cannot perceive, are carried off, or obliterated in their Original.

I &s;hould rather tru&s;t to the&s;e for the Cure of a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> by what I have &s;een in my &s;elf, than to the in|&s;ipid and &s;carce tepid Waters of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>I have now given a &s;hort Hint only of &s;ome few of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es for which the&s;e Waters are proper; Time would fail me to enumerate them all.</P>
<P>This gives a great Reputation unto the Excellency of the&s;e Waters, that when Phy&s;icians have in vain applied their own Preparations to obtain a Cure, they are forced to fly to the&s;e Divine Remedies, and do very often find their Account here.</P>
<P>Since it is agreed, by the general Con&s;ent and Experience of Nations, to a&s;cribe extraordinary Vertues to the&s;e Sorts of Fountains that are impregnated with Chalybeat Particles, and there|fore are called Steel Waters; I hope I have done <HI>this my Native Country,</HI> not only a Piece of Ju&s;tice, but an accept|able Service, in the&s;e my Endeavours to recommend to them the&s;e particular Waters of <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince it appears, that they do in many Degrees
<PB N="30" REF="44">&s;urpa&s;s any of our own Waters, in their Medicinal Properties, or any others that are brought to us from Foreign Parts.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome particular Advanta|ges and Privileged which belong to this Chalybeat Fountain, for this Spring abounds with a va&s;t Quantity of Water, it is more portable, carries, and holds its Vertue better than any other; I have kept it a Summer and Winter without Decay; it is &s;cituated as near the Sea Side as any Foreign Water, and requires le&s;s Land Carriage; and, I doubt not in Time, &s;o &s;oon as a Trade is &s;ettled, it will be brought over much cheaper than any Sort of Foreign Wa|ter from Abroad.</P>
<P>It can be no Objection to me again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, which I find &s;ome have complain'd of beyond the Sea, that the&s;e are too heavy and too &s;trong of the Mineral. I do allow them to contain a very great Proportion of that Ingredient in them, as a Proof of their Excellency; for the Mineral here is not a gro&s;s and heavy Ocre, but finely re|ctified and exalted; a Vitriol (not to be match'd by humane Art) well di&s;&s;olv'd in its watry Vehicle. For Want of In|&s;truments,
<PB N="31" REF="45">I could not make the Experi|ment &s;o very nice, but yet I found that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he Waters of this Spring were not at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll more (but rather le&s;s) ponde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">han common Rain Water, as to the Specifick Gravity.</P>
<P>We may allow that the&s;e Waters may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e too &s;trong for &s;ome weak Stomachs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">his is ea&s;ily remedied by mixing a ju&s;t Proportion of good fair Water with it.

<P>It was a great Satisfaction to me to have this Notion confirm'd by the mo&s;t Learned Archiater to King <HI>George,</HI> Dr. <HI>Steigerthall,</HI> a Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of the College of Phy&s;ician; who cur'd a tender Lady labouring under &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eral de&s;perate Di&s;tempers, (when, &s;he could not bear the Water of the Well) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y mixing equal Parts of &s;imple Water with the <HI>Pyrmontane.</HI> He further recom|mends this Method to be made U&s;e of by others, if they have any Rea&s;on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;pect the&s;e Waters to di&s;agree with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hem as being too &s;trong. For my Part, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> think it a great Benefit to us in <HI>Eng|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">and,</HI> that we are directed to a Water
<PB N="32" REF="46">of a Strength &s;uperiour to any in U&s;e among&s;t us, which I hope, and am per|&s;waded, will rejoice the Hearts, and ani|mate the drooping Spirits of many a &s;ad and hypocondriack Soul; for whom mo&s;t of our Chalybeats are found too weak.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trong Argument that Cha|lybeat Waters, particularly the <HI>Spa,</HI> have given great Satisfaction, and done much good, becau&s;e they have been much more pre&s;crib'd and us'd among&s;t us of late Years than formerly; and they would &s;till be in greater Vogue if they were not adulterated, or if the true Waters from the <HI>Spa</HI> could be brought to us in Perfection with their original Strength, which (I am &s;orry to &s;ay) can rarely be brought to pa&s;s. On the other Hand, tho&s;e of <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> with but a very moderate Care in &s;topping, can &s;carce fail of being delivered to us in their full Strength. I am fully per|&s;waded that Experience will &s;oon evince and demon&s;trate the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>It is another Misfortune, that the Chalybeat Fountains of Water, &s;uch as <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> &amp;c. can be only applied to in the warm Weather, for four or five
<PB N="33" REF="47">Months in the Year; but &s;ince the&s;e Waters, (which were brought before the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in Winter) after they were a little warm'd by the Fire, did then give very good Proof of their admira|ble Vertue, we may hence be &s;ecur'd of their being like to be brought into U&s;e, even in the &s;evere&s;t Winters.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s by a Propo&s;ition of the a|bovenamed Learned Phy&s;ician, Dr. <HI>Stei|gerthall,</HI> my worthy Friend, who, in a curi|ous Tract of his, gives an Account of great Variety of Waters in <HI>Germany</HI> and other Places, and particularly mentions this, That at <HI>Swalbach,</HI> when the Weather is cold, they bring the Waters to the Fire, and warm them before they drink them: He propo&s;es the making the&s;e Waters warm by an ignited Rod or Gad of Iron; the Doctor confe&s;&s;es with great Mode&s;ty that he never made the Ex|periment, but to me it &s;eems &s;o ratio|nal, that it ought to be taken Notice of; and that it may be made practical, give me leave to add the&s;e Directions. Take a &s;mall Bar or Rod of Iron, about a Foot long, fit a wooden Handle to one End, to be put on or off at Di&s;|cretion, pour off half a Pint of Water out of the Flask, into a convenient Ve&s;|&s;el
<PB N="34" REF="48">of Silver or China, not of Gla&s;s, plunge the ignited Iron into the Water, bring the Water to a very low Degree of Heat; when you pour off more out of the Flask, get your Heaters always rea|dy. In this Experiment you lo&s;e none of the Chalybeat Vertue of the Waters, but rather receive an Addition from the heated Iron. You obviate another Inconvenience, when a whole Flask is warmed in boiling Water, as we u&s;e the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, it will be apt to de|&s;pirit and make the whole Bottle flat and lifele&s;s. But this Way may the&s;e <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters in the colde&s;t Sea&s;ons of the Year be drank, with the &s;ame Vertue, and therefore with as much Benefit as in Summer, nay, perhaps with many People to better Advantage; The Waters being more likely to pa&s;s off by Urine in cold Weather, than in the hot Summer.</P>
<P>Whereas I have animadverted above upon the great Quantity of Waters that are drank, at the &s;our Brunns or <HI>Acidulae</HI> (&s;o called) abroad, it &s;eemed to me in|credible that any Per&s;on &s;hould drink for &s;everal Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;uch an extravagant Quantity as that of &s;ix or &s;even Quarts of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure,
<PB N="35" REF="49">which I now no more doubt of, having read it in Dr. <HI>Steigerthall</HI>'s ingenious Treati&s;e; though I am very well a&s;|&s;ured, that it was never done with his Advice, nor with his Approbation. It is the more &s;urpri&s;ing to us, becau&s;e we do &s;ee very good Effects of a &s;ingle Flask of <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, (when they are good, that is, brisk and vigorous) in recovering Health, provided they are continued for near a Month more or le&s;s. One of the&s;e Flasks does not fully contain a Quart and half of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure. It mu&s;t be allow'd, that there may be now and then a Ca&s;e extraordinary, which will require greater Quantities than what is u&s;ual, but rarely any Thing &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive as what is here mentioned: A|mong&s;t our <HI>Bath</HI> Patients, the Quantity of Two of our Quarts is e&s;teem'd a large Proportion; and mo&s;t abide at One, or Three Pints: And Two Quarts of the Chalybeat are reckon'd a large Do&s;e, and to be allow'd to only very &s;trong Per&s;ons.</P>

<P>This was Printed in the Tran&s;acti|ons of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> Vol. 28. for the Year, 1713. Now, at the Reque&s;t of &s;ome Friends, is placed here.</P>
<P>I Have for many Years pa&s;t, had more than a bare Su&s;picion, that Phy&s;icians and Learned Per&s;ons had impos'd upon them&s;elves and others, erroneous Notions about the Nature and Properties of tho&s;e Mineral Waters which are of the Chalybeat or Iro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Species. <HI>Germany</HI> abounds much with the&s;e Waters, and they be&s;tow one ge+neral Name upon them, and call them &s;our Brunns, that is, &s;our Wells o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Springs of Water.

<PB N="37" REF="51">&amp;c. <HI>Henricus ab Heers</HI> agrees with <HI>Vitruvius, Fallopius,</HI> and the &s;agacious <HI>Helmont,</HI> and other Men of great Fame, in ju&s;tifying the Acidity of &s;everal Sorts of <HI>Spa</HI> and Chalybeat Waters; but not being &s;atisfy'd with their Rea&s;ons, a&s;|&s;igns others; and after a tedious and ob&s;cure Harangue, concludes, that they owe their Birth and great Vertues to Vitriol and Sulphur. He ob&s;erves, that Vitriol and Sulphur are found in the Glebe or Earth, from whence the&s;e Wa|ters do &s;pring, but yet does not give us one Proof or Experiment of his hav|ing found any real Vitriol, or true Sul|phur, or any Acidity in tho&s;e Waters. He fills his Book with Imaginations and Quotations, expo&s;ing other Mens Ignorance, whil&s;t he him&s;elf is plunged in the &s;ame common vulgar Errour.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Jordis,</HI> an eminent Phy&s;ician at <HI>Francford,</HI> and a Fellow of the <HI>Roy|al Society,</HI> did formerly vi&s;it the famous Well or &s;our Brunn at <HI>Swalbach</HI> in Sum|mer time, and practi&s;ed there during the Sea&s;on: I was my &s;elf then exa|mining the Nature of all Sorts of Wa|ters, Cathartick and Chalybeat, or Steel Waters, and the other which contain the bitter purging Salts; my Reque&s;t to
<PB N="38" REF="52">this very Learned Phy&s;ician was, That he would give me an Account of the Contents of the &s;aid Water, number'd among&s;t the <HI>Acidulae;</HI> particularly, whe|ther by Di&s;tillation he could obtain any Thing &s;our or acid, as Vinegar and Juice of Oranges will do this Way; but he could not &s;atisfy me that the lea&s;t Drop of acid did ri&s;e, or di&s;til over. He al&s;o evaporated a great Quantity of this Water <HI>ad &s;iccitatem,</HI> and thought that he found &s;ome Sulphureous Parts in it; but Sulphur it &s;elf is far from being an acid, but the contrary. He al&s;o found Ocre and other ferrugineous Particles contain'd in it, but the&s;e we find in all Chalybeat Waters, which do truly belong to the Nature of Al|kalis, and not of Acids.</P>
<P>That which gave me the fir&s;t Su&s;pi|cion, that the Chalybeat Waters did not contain any rough or acid Salts in them, proceeded from an accidental U&s;e of a very &s;trong Iron Water, which happen'd to me above Thirty Years ago, in &s;uch a Place, where I could get no other: In this Water I di&s;&s;olved my Soap, wa&s;hed my Hands, and found it to la|ther beyond my Expectation, I al&s;o &s;haved with it. I afterwards tried &s;ome
<PB N="39" REF="53">other Chalybeat Waters, which did the &s;ame, that is, much better than Pump Water did.</P>
<P N="1">I. I con&s;ulted my Palate, and tri|ed whether I could di&s;cover any Sharp|ne&s;s or Acidity in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Steel Waters at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> at the <HI>Black-Boy</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Franfield</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> at <HI>Hamp&s;tead, Sunning-Hill</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> and other Places; But I was &s;o far from di&s;covering any &s;uch Thing, that the&s;e Waters &s;eem'd rather to leave a &s;weeti&s;h Flavour or Farewel behind: Thus many Alkaly Salts, if nicely exa|mined, (of the fixed Kind) have affect|ed my Ta&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. I made Experiments with &s;eve|ral Sorts of &s;uch Spirits as are apt to ferment with Acids, &s;uch as Spirit of <HI>Hart&s;horn,</HI> of <HI>Sal Armoniac,</HI> &amp;c. but the&s;e made no Ferment, nor any Motion, or Efferve&s;cence in the&s;e Wa|ters.</P>
<P N="3">III. I con&s;idered the Di&s;ea&s;es in Humane Bodies, which tho&s;e Waters were pre&s;cribed by Phy&s;icians to cure; That they were often &s;uch as proceed|ed
<PB N="40" REF="54">from &s;harp, acid, or acrimonious Cau&s;es, as <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> or Heart Burn|ings, &s;our Vomitings, corro&s;ive Diar|raea's, Colicks from Scurvies and Stran|guries; and that for the&s;e Di&s;tempers &s;weetning and alkali&s;ate Remedies are made U&s;e of.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I con&s;ider'd the&s;e Waters as con|taining in them the Properties of Iron, and I find by Experience, that it is mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to Acids, being one of their great Correctors; and therefore rather to be e&s;teemed an Alkaly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take &s;ome Filings of Iron, per|haps a Dram, and pour on them about an Ounce of the milder Acids, &s;uch as Vinegar, Verjuice, or the Juice of Li|mons, and it will de&s;troy the Sharp|ne&s;s of the&s;e Juices: Or if you pour on the&s;e Filings, Mineral Acids, as the very corro&s;ive Spirit of Nitre, or of Salt, or what is called Oil of Vitriol, they will immediately lo&s;e their Aci|dity, be di&s;arm'd of their &s;harp Points, and by Evaporation give a Salt that will ta&s;t &s;weeti&s;h, and is by Chymi&s;ts called <HI>Saccharum Martis,</HI> if duly pre|pared,
<PB N="41" REF="55">which is &s;afely given inwardly, and is e&s;teemed a good altering Medi|cine.</P>
<P N="2">2. Steel beaten to a fine Powder, is without any farther Preparation given inwardly with great Succe&s;s for Stomachick Di&s;ea&s;es, as in the Green-Sickne&s;s, Hypocondriack, and various other acid and acrimonious Di&s;affecti|ons.</P>
<P N="5">V. I con&s;idered Milk to be a very proper and obvious Subject to bring this Controver&s;y to a plain and unque&s;tio|nable Deci&s;ion. I made this Experi|ment with all po&s;&s;ible Exactne&s;s: I fir&s;t proved the Chalybeat Waters, more particularly the <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, by trying whether, they tinged with Galls. The&s;e being very good, I put Part of the Waters to cold Milk, &s;ome I only made Lukewarm, and &s;ome I boiled together in equal Proportions; But they were &s;o far from affording any Curd or Coagulation, that they conti|nued &s;everal Days without being &s;our. Since Mineral Waters, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are Chalybeat, are of &s;uch impor|tant
<PB N="42" REF="56">U&s;e in Phy&s;ick, and have gain'd among&s;t us &s;o ju&s;t a Reputation for their excellent Vertues, and are the greate&s;t Refuge in very potent and ob|&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;es; This has made me judge it a Work not unacceptable to Virtuo&s;o's, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Fa|culty of Phy&s;ick, to have this Medi|cine fairly examin'd, its genuine Pro|perties a&s;&s;erted, and what was called an Acid, to be demon&s;trated an Alka|ly. Is it not a Sort of Ju&s;tice due to the World, that the <HI>Germans,</HI> who &s;ent us over the&s;e Waters, with this fal&s;e Character of &s;our Waters, &s;hould ba|ni&s;h this mi&s;guiding Term from their <HI>Spa's?</HI></P>
<P>It is from this Mi&s;take, that their Phy&s;icians do prohibit the U&s;e of all Manner of <HI>Lacticinia,</HI> as if they were as noxious as deadly Poi&s;ons, whil&s;t they are in a Cour&s;e of their Medici|nal Waters, unju&s;tly called Sour Brunns.</P>
<P>Since this Prejudice has prevailed very much among&s;t mo&s;t of our Wa|ter Drinkers in <HI>England,</HI> I do atte&s;t, that I have frequently advis'd in &s;ome Ca&s;es, Milk to be given daily in the Evening, through a whole Cour&s;e of
<PB N="43" REF="57">Steel Waters, with good Effect: Nay, I do affirm, that &s;ome others could not bear the&s;e Waters without having a Third Part of Milk or more, mixed with them; and have continued them &s;o for many Weeks with good Advan|tage: Nor do I find the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to prohibit the U&s;e of Milk in a Cour&s;e of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, having been there a|bove a Year and half, making the be&s;t Scrutiny I could into the Properties; Vertues, and Vices (if they have any) of tho&s;e Waters: Here we u&s;e A&s;&s;es Milk Morning and Afternoon in the U&s;e of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters; nor did I ever forbid Cows Milk, where it agreed with that Per&s;on, at any other Time.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Since our Experiments di&s;co|ver, that tho&s;e Things which are of a &s;weetning Alkali&s;ate Nature, do &s;o very well agree with the&s;e Mineral Waters, it will appear by the following Experiment, that Acids do very much di&s;agree.</P>
<P N="1">1. I put but one Drop of Oil of Vitriol to a large Gla&s;s full of &s;trong <HI>Spa</HI> Waters, which, before the Addi|tion
<PB N="44" REF="58">of this Acid, did give a deep Pur|ple to the Solution of Galls, but now would not give the lea&s;t Tincture, though I put in Four Times, as much of the Galls: From hence I conclude, That the Vertues of the Chalybeat Ingredients, which I take to be the Life and Soul of the&s;e Waters, were &s;o far bound up or de&s;troyed, as to have lo&s;t their Cordial, or corrobora|ting Faculty, and that the Bile or Gall in the Humane Bowels, could not be able to &s;eparate the Chalybeat (which are the only medical) Particles, and mix them with the Chyle, in order to an|&s;wer any End in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>Let this be a Caution to tho&s;e that de&s;ign to make the&s;e Waters pa&s;s better by Urine, that they do not make U&s;e of any Acids, it being a common Pra|ctice to u&s;e Spirit of Vitriol, <HI>Spiritus Nitri dulcis,</HI> &amp;c. as a Diuretick, unle&s;s it &s;hould &s;o happen, that they have a De&s;ign to take off and dive&s;t them of their warm Cordial or altering Power, and &s;o to bring them near to common Water; which I mu&s;t confe&s;s we are forc'd to do, e&s;pecially in the U&s;e of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, in &s;ome hot inflammatory Ca&s;es.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="59">
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall conclude with one &s;hort Experiment in Favour of our Alkalies; That if you put any Alkaly Salt, vola|tile or fixed, &s;uch as volatile Salt of <HI>Hart&s;horn,</HI> or of <HI>Sal Armoniac,</HI> or fixed Salt of <HI>Tartar,</HI> of <HI>Wormwood,</HI> or any other true Alkaly, you will then de|&s;troy the abovenamed acid Spirit which was dropt into the Water, and will re|cover the Vertue of the Waters, and di&s;po&s;e them to give their Tincture as they u&s;ed to do in their natural State.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT</HEAD>
<P>AFter many fruitle&s;s Attempts to get a Book from <HI>Germany,</HI> which treated of the&s;e Waters <HI>ex profe&s;&s;o,</HI> at length I obtained the&s;e Two, of which I &s;hall give a &s;hort Account; they did not come to my Hand until my little Tract was fini&s;hed, and my Papers were actually with the Printer.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t I &s;hall take Notice of, is one Dr. <HI>Cunaeus,</HI> who&s;e Book was Printed about Seven Years &s;ince; of whom I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay very little, becau&s;e he treats of many Niceties and Impertinencies to the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es; he enumerates an Abundance of his <HI>Ar|canum's</HI> and <HI>No&s;trum's,</HI> and imputes &s;uch extraordinary Vertues to them, which make the&s;e &s;anative Waters, and all o|ther <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> needle&s;s. As to the Nature of the Waters, he had not the lea&s;t Imagination of their being any Thing el&s;e, but an <HI>Acidula,</HI> or &s;our Brunn; but this mi&s;taken Notion will do le&s;s Harm than his Practice did, who,
<PB N="47" REF="61">Page 17. directs the Patient at his fir&s;t Drinking to begin with Two Quarts of the Waters; in another Place he gives a great Charge to the Water-Drinker, to have a great Care of med|dling with that dangerous Thing Milk, and remarks, that &s;everal Children having drank the&s;e Waters, upon eating Milk, did fall into Convul&s;ions and other Di&s;ea&s;es. He al&s;o ob&s;erves, That &s;eve|ral Per&s;ons who did put Sugar into the&s;e &s;our Waters, and others, who drank a Gla&s;s of Wine betwixt their Draughts of Waters, did by this Means fall into dangerous Di&s;tempers. As to Milk, not only my own Experience of many Years &s;tanding, di&s;charges it from cau|&s;ing any bad Effects if u&s;ed the &s;ame Day, wherein the Patient drinks Cha|lybeat Waters, but I have the concur|ring Te&s;timony of the be&s;t of our Phy|&s;icians now alive, as well as of many that are lately dead, that they have put their Patients into a Cour&s;e of joining Milk with our Steel Waters at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and other Places, and have had the good Succe&s;s of making the Waters agree better with the Patient, and have cur'd that Di&s;ea&s;e this Way, which they could not do by by the Waters
<PB N="48" REF="62">alone. His judging and cen&s;uring Su|gar for having had malignant Influen|ces on tho&s;e that di&s;&s;olve it in the&s;e Waters, is ab&s;olutely intolerable.

I have &s;everal Times caus'd my Patients at the <HI>Bath</HI> to mix fine white Sugar Candy with their Waters with very good Suc|ce&s;s. I little &s;u&s;pected to have a Gla&s;s of Wine forbid by a <HI>German,</HI> which I have found a nece&s;&s;ary Diuretick for &s;ome. The Prohibition of mixing Wine with Chalybeat Waters to be drank at Meals will never take Place in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e both &s;trong and weak, the heal|thy and &s;ickly, do con&s;pire with us here to drink it mixt at Meals, and declare it to be both plea&s;ant and beneficial. But it is high Time to pa&s;s over &s;uch Trifles, and to look into the following Author.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Seippius,</HI> appointed by Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> (the Proprietor of the&s;e Wa|tess) to be the only Phy&s;ician to pra|cti&s;e at <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> has publi&s;hed his Book this Year, 1717.</P>
<P>This ingenious and very indu&s;trious Per&s;on has taken much Pains to examine and enquire into the Principles and
<PB N="49" REF="63">Operations of the&s;e Waters. He has made many curious and u&s;eful Experi|ments, which have led him nearer the Standard of Truth, than any of his Predece&s;&s;ors. For tho&s;e Contents or Ingredients which he found in the Sedi|ment of the Water, he is forc'd to con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, that they are all Alkalies, and that hey cannot exert the lea&s;t acid Effect in the Waters, but rather owns them to have a healing and bal&s;amick Quality; &s;o that in reality he ought to declare him|&s;elf a Pro&s;elyte to my new Notion, that even this <HI>Pyrmont</HI> &s;our Brunn, is a &s;weet dulcifying Water, and a true Alkaly.</P>
<P>But yet &s;uch is the Prejudice of Cu|&s;tom and common Opinion, that even this candid Author cannot altogether in the fir&s;t Part of his Tract clear him&s;elf of this wrong Notion, of the&s;e Waters having an acid or &s;our Ta&s;t, which does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ot appear to me, nor to any of my Friends, who attentively con&s;ider it. He al&s;o thinks, that there is a latent Acid conceal'd in the&s;e Waters, and that it comes from the Sulphur of the Pyrites, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rom which the&s;e medicated Waters are derived; but &s;till he confe&s;&s;es, that this Acid can exert no manner of Effect,
<PB N="50" REF="64">being quite &s;ubject to tho&s;e Alkalies con|tained in the Water.</P>
<P>The Contents of the&s;e Waters, he &s;ays, are a &s;weet, &s;ubtle, Alkaly Earth, have the Selenites, or &s;omewhat like a tran&s;parent Cry&s;tal, a &s;mall Quantity of Salt, Iron and Sulphur. We do even in our Mineral Waters, e&s;pecially in that of the <HI>Bath,</HI> find a Sort of a Cretaceous Sub&s;tance, which we &s;ay is from the <HI>Lapis Calcarius;</HI> (with which our Earth in <HI>England</HI> does much abound) and &s;eems to be that very tran&s;parent Sub&s;tance which he calls Selenites, and the &s;weet Alkaly Earth. Iron is indeed a very great Alkaly, ab&s;orbs and corrects all Acids, as we have prov'd to a Demon|&s;tration in this Tract.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Page</HI> 40, 41.</NOTE> It is from the Sulphur or Brim&s;tone which he di&s;covers in tho&s;e Waters, that an Acidity or Sourne&s;s is thought to be deriv'd to the&s;e Waters, which &s;till is only imagi|nary, becau&s;e the contrary Quality ap|pears to be there.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, That I formerly never &s;o much as doubted Sulphur to be other than an Acid, having always heard &s;o
<PB N="51" REF="65">much Talk of the very &s;harp Oil of Sulphur, and Gas of Sulphur, be&s;ides the very &s;uffocating and acrimonious Vapour of Brim&s;tone, when kindled or made to flame, might ea&s;ily impo&s;e &s;uch a fal&s;e Opinion upon the unwary; but Experiment will prove ju&s;t the contrary, and we &s;hall find it rather to belong to the Alkalies, and not to have the lea&s;t Shew or Foot&s;tep of an Acid in it: No, not to have &s;o much of the Acid in it, as the plea&s;ant and &s;weete&s;t Wine of <HI>Italy,</HI> or the <HI>Canaries</HI> contain in them; for the&s;e, when boiled with Milk, make a &s;trong Curd, which Sulphur will not do.</P>
<P>The Experiment. We took a Dram of Flowers of Brim&s;tone, and a quar|ter of a Pint of Milk, and boiled them together, they did not in the lea&s;t cur|dle the Milk, but made it ta&s;t more &s;oft and bal&s;amick than it did before. If you ta&s;t Sulphur, it lies &s;oft upon the Tongue, does not give the lea&s;t &s;ub|acid Reli&s;h; on the contrary, from hence are our healing and pectoral Bal&s;ams made, and many cutaneous and itching Di&s;tempers of the Skin, where the Hu|mours do tare and lacerate the &s;uperfi|cial
<PB N="52" REF="66">Parts, Sulphur is made U&s;e of as a vulnerary, and cures beyond mo&s;t other Applications. It is true it has a &s;trong offen&s;ive Smell, but not the lea&s;t of an acid Smell, Ta&s;t, or Quality, un|le&s;s you reduce it to Flame; and then it is no longer Sulphur, but what proceeds from it is actually a Creature of the Fire. Let me give one common In|&s;tance, to &s;hew the Difference between a Sub&s;tance in its natural State, and when brought to an actual Flame, <HI>viz.</HI> good Oil of Olives may be &s;wallow'd for a healing, plea&s;ant, inward Medi|cine, and is outwardly apply'd to ea&s;e an Inflammation or heal a Sore; in like manner the Tallow of a Candle may be apply'd to a &s;ore Part, but if you touch the Flame of either of the&s;e, you will be made &s;en&s;ible, that they have lo&s;t all their Properties, and that what was a vulnerary, is become now of a corro&s;ive and devouring Nature.</P>
<P>I perceive, that this &s;edulous Author has by &s;trong Fires di&s;tilled &s;ome acid Spirits out of great Quantities of the Se|diment of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, which may well be obtain'd from tho&s;e Salts and Sulphurs, he &s;ays, are contain'd in them; but whatever they are, I do po|&s;itively
<PB N="53" REF="67">a&s;&s;ert the&s;e acid Spirits to be Creatures of the Fire, and not to have been originally in the Water; Thus Oil of Vitriol (which our Author truly a&s;|&s;erts to be the &s;ame with Oil of Sul|phur) is only Fire wrapt up, or incorpo|rated in a little moi&s;t Vehicle, will burn your Fle&s;h, rai&s;e Bli&s;ters, heat Water, and give many other Proofs of its fiery Nature; which it may well do, having been perhaps 24 Hours a con&s;tant igni|ted Body of Fire.</P>
<P>Having prov'd Sulphur to be an Al|kaly, this will furni&s;h our Author with one Argument more, and a very &s;trong one, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Opinion, that our Chalybeat Waters are Alkalies, not <HI>Aci|dulae;</HI> for what Refuge can the Acidi&s;t fly to in order to the &s;upporting the No|tion of the&s;e Waters being an <HI>Acidula,</HI> or a &s;our Brunn; &s;ince even Brim&s;tone it &s;elf (contain'd in the&s;e Waters, and judg'd an unque&s;tionable Acid) proves to be the Rever&s;e, or ju&s;t contrary?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge my &s;elf very much indebted to him for this following Experiment, which alone would &s;uffice to put a fini&s;hing, deci&s;ive Stroak to all this Controver&s;y: In Page 109. he &s;ays, <HI>That the&s;e Waters do make a pretty &s;trong
<PB N="54" REF="68">Efferve&s;cence with all Sorts of Sours, as with Vinegar, Wine, Spirit of Nitre, of Salt, of Vitriol:</HI> This Experiment outdoes all I ever met with, for none of our Waters (though &s;ome of them &s;eem full of Iron) do in the lea&s;t pretend to &s;uch an Alkaly, as in the lea&s;t to ferment with Acids. But if this &s;hould fail, as I can &s;carce think it will, becau&s;e it is &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, that when fre&s;h taken up at the Fountain Head it does ferment; yet the following Experiment exhibits as certain, tho' not &s;o &s;udden a Demon|&s;tration. He makes U&s;e of Milk, and boils it with his Waters, and declares, that they will not curdle, but rather that they do pre&s;erve the Milk from coagu|lating: See Page 148, 248. of this Au|thor. He makes the &s;ame Experiment and Ob&s;ervation with mine Printed in the Tran&s;action above 3 Years &s;ince, and &s;ince reprinted here.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 41.</NOTE> And infers as we do, that this is a &s;trong Argument of the Alkalies contained in the&s;e Wa|ters.</P>
<P>Our Author takes Notice of a Quan|tity of Salt he finds in the&s;e Waters,
<PB N="55" REF="69">at the utmo&s;t 14 Grains in a Quart, to which he would a&s;cribe the &s;ame purg|ing Vertue; that our purging Salts have; but having had a De&s;ire to &s;atisfy my &s;elf in this Matter, I cau&s;ed a very in|genious Chymi&s;t to make an accurate Examen of the&s;e Waters new brought over, and he obtained about Ten Grains of Salt which one Quart afforded; this Salt con&s;i&s;ted of a con&s;iderable Pro|portion of Sea-Salt mixt with a bitter Salt; but had the Water held ten times the Quantity of that Compound Salt, it could not have cau&s;ed one Purge, e&s;pecially &s;ince the&s;e Waters are in them|&s;elves re&s;tringent, and guarded with &s;tiptick Ingredients.</P>
<P>Now we are giving due Prai&s;es to the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, we may al&s;o ex|pect that Ju&s;tice be done to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> purging Salts, which are de&s;ervedly in|troduc'd and receiv'd in our <HI>Materia Medica:</HI> This Author wrong repre&s;ents them as a Chymical Compo&s;ition of &s;ome Alkaly or other, join'd with an Acid: To my certain Knowledge many Centners of Pounds have been made out of our Purging Waters; but now indeed they have found out another Sort of a <HI>Minera,</HI> which produces this very
<PB N="56" REF="70">particular Salt, and is of the very &s;ame Figure, Ta&s;t, and Operation; but after this Way it can be made at le&s;s Expence, which &s;till contributes more Good to Mankind. There is no more Art us'd in making this admirable Salt, than in making our common Sea Salt, there is nothing added to it, only other Mix|tures are &s;eparated from it. Our Sea Salt may more pertinently be &s;tyled an Artificial Chymical Compo&s;ition than this purging Salt, becau&s;e there are more Things added to make that Gra|nulat than are requir'd for this, tho' they are both hewn from off the &s;ame Rock, or dug out of the &s;ame Mine. I do not think it the wor&s;t Action of my Life for having been an early In&s;tru|ment in preparing and bringing this purging Salt into Practice; having made and u&s;ed it before Doctor <HI>Grew,</HI> that ex|cellent Phy&s;ician, publi&s;h'd it to the World: It was once at 20 <HI>s.</HI> the Pound, he brought it to 8 <HI>s.</HI> I rejoice to &s;ee it, for the good of the Poor, at 12 <HI>d.</HI> the Pound: So that now they may have 16 Purges for one Shilling.</P>
<P>I have remarked above, that of late our Practice condemns the giving large Quantities of our ferruginous Waters. Our
<PB N="57" REF="71">Author here goes on &s;omewhat fa&s;t in advancing &s;o high as to direct Three Quarts of Water to be given to the Drinker the Third Day, but he makes a Stand at Four Quarts: I know it is a hard Matter, where the Practice of Drinking great Quantities has been con|tinued &s;o long, not to be born down with the Torrent of ancient Cu&s;tom; but yet I mu&s;t &s;ay in his Commendation, that though he be yet a young Man, he &s;ees the Error, and will doubtle&s;s &s;hake off the Prejudice of Cu&s;tom and Education: For in Page 203. he con|fe&s;&s;es, that it were safer and better to drink the Waters more moderately, and, as he &s;ays, <HI>not to offer Violence to Nature,</HI> but to allow more Time for a Cure.</P>
<P>This very Method would prevent another Inconvenience of Purging &s;o much as they do; for if they did not o|vercharge the Drinker with &s;uch Abun|dance of Water, there would general|ly &s;peaking) be no need of Catharticks to di&s;charge that Burden.</P>
<P>Both later and former Drinkers of the mention'd Waters at <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">mont,</HI> have related to me, that they were advis'd by the Learned, and compell'd by the Example of mo&s;t Drinkers, to u&s;e much
<PB N="58" REF="72">Motion to make their Waters pa&s;s the better; but &s;urely in the Heat of Sum|mer it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make them &s;weat, and hinder the right Evacuation by Urine. This is cen&s;ur'd above, and I am pleas'd to find this Phy&s;ician pru|dently recommend a le&s;s violent Mo|tion to his Patient, &s;uch as &s;hall create no Sweat; I am in good Hopes, that the di&s;creet Conduct of &s;o worthy a Per&s;on, will correct and cure &s;ome of tho&s;e Errors, which Length of Time has fix'd and rooted; and that he will make the&s;e Waters &s;till more beneficial to tho&s;e that drink them there.</P>
<P>I will conclude with a Quotation he has furni&s;h'd me with, from Profe&s;&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation:</HI> Upon who&s;e Te|&s;timony I &s;et a great Value, becau&s;e he is a mo&s;t excellent and con&s;ummate Phy&s;ician, and a curious Chymi&s;t: He &s;ays, <HI>Optimi qui virtute omnes, no&s;tro qui|dem judicio, antecellunt, &s;unt fontes Pyr|montani.</HI> And farther: That upon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Examen he had made of many Waters <HI>the</HI> Pyrmont <HI>excell'd all in the Subtilt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Plenty of Spirits.</HI> I have now ob|tain'd a Parcel of the&s;e Waters, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> are come to my Hands, and are ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> good, and do an&s;wer the Character given of them.</P>

<HEAD>A &s;hort Examen of a Treati&s;e of Iron Waters, but especially of <HI>Ip&s;wich Spa;</HI> Dedicated to the College of Phy&s;icians, <HI>1717.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE unknown, or conceal'd Au|thor, will doubtle&s;s be found out at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> e&s;pecially at this Fountain Head, with a va&s;t Train of Patients daily crouding about the&s;e All-healing Waters; to which he a&s;cribes &s;uch &s;uper|lative Vertues, as far exceed all other Waters, but e&s;pecially <HI>German Spa</HI> Wa|ters: We are very &s;everely chid and cen&s;ur'd for our <HI>great Vanity and Folly in buying, and Cheats in &s;elling the&s;e</HI> Waters; and that we may be &s;ure not to overlook this Cen&s;ure, it is put in the Title Page of this Book.</P>
<P>The Characters or Encomiums he gives, or attributes to the&s;e new-found Waters, are very great. That they do excel other Waters, in their plea&s;ant and brisk, or &s;pirituous Ta&s;t, in the Proper|ty of keeping many Months without Lo&s;s of Strength, in their Volatility, and doing great Cures, and in many other &s;uper-excellent Qualities he a&s;&s;igns them,
<PB N="60" REF="74">&s;ufficient to make any credulous Per|&s;on forthwith to take the Flying Coach, and to ha&s;ten to this Well, to con&s;ult the Doctor, which he directs, p. 28. to be very nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>For my Part, I am per&s;waded that he would &s;oon have Numbers of Pa|trons and Advocates, to join with him in extolling and recommending his Waters, provided they could be a&s;&s;ured of the Truth of their a&s;&s;umed Vertue. Nor would he have Cau&s;e to be jealous of the Faculty it &s;elf, of being &s;uch Fools and A&s;&s;es as he &s;eems to de&s;cribe them, pag. 82. <HI>Stiff Zealots, adhering to their own Opinions, like A&s;&s;es being once led to Water; will drink at the &s;ame Place if po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;everal hard Cen&s;ures de|nounced &s;omewhat ha&s;tily, if not un|mannerly too; he might have waited &s;ome Months, and have &s;een whether the World would not have been pro|&s;elyted by fair Means, good Words or his &s;trong Arguments, which, he &s;ays, he has laid down to Demon&s;trati|on, before he u&s;ed &s;uch a &s;atyrical and har&s;h Method. Nor do I think thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Anonymous</HI> Author to be ignorant tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="61" REF="75">we live in an inqui&s;itive Age, and that the Faculty will not admit into their Materials of Phy&s;ick &s;uch new Medicines, of which they have no Ex|perience. Wherefore the Author mu&s;t expect &s;ome Queries, or Remarks, or Po&s;tulata, will be propos'd: I ask leave only for &s;ome very few, having no Room for many.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. Let me candidly expo&s;tulate with our Author, whether be has taken the be&s;t Way to convince us of the pre|tended Excellency of his Waters, by depreciating others, and &s;o dogmati|cally a&s;&s;erting the Value of his own? Why did he not &s;end a Hamper of his Waters to the Pre&s;ident and Electors of the College, and that in Time, be|fore his Book had been delivered to them. This was ea&s;y for him to do, becau&s;e his Waters may be dip'd in the Morning, and be delivered at <HI>London</HI> in the Even; This was done by me be|fore I pre&s;umed to give my Account of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rmont</HI> Water; I obtained the Ap|probation of the Two famous Societies, having brought a Quantity of the&s;e Waters for them to ta&s;t, and to exa|mine by other Experiments: This Wa|ter is oft kept back by contrary Winds,
<PB N="62" REF="76">and &s;o came not to my Hands before it had been dip'd at lea&s;t Two Months, and at lea&s;t 8 Months before either of the Societies had it pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Does he think, That an up|&s;tart <HI>Spring of Water, which he &s;ays,</HI> pag. 126. <HI>is lately di&s;covered at</HI> Ip&s;wich, <HI>and that has but &s;ix Weeks obtained its full Perfection,</HI> &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly gain &s;uch Authority and Power, as to prohibit or pro&s;cribe the U&s;e of tho&s;e celebrated <HI>German</HI> Waters, which Phy&s;icians of the preceding, as well as the pre&s;ent Age, have &s;ucce&s;sfully pre&s;cribed to their Pa|tients?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. Is it not more likely that he aims at his own Intere&s;t more than at the Good of Mankind? What is the Meaning of his taking Care to have an <HI>Arcanum</HI> of his to be al&s;o mixt with the&s;e Waters, he gives it the Name of <HI>Tinctura Ba&s;ilica;</HI> which it &s;eems is &s;old up and down the Town of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> as <HI>Daphy's</HI> Elixir, or <HI>Stoughton's</HI> Drops? Altogether con&s;idered, it, makes one &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, that the Doctor and Proprietor have a great Regard to &s;elf and by-Ends: when convinced of the contrary, I &s;hall &s;oon retract.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="77">
<P>In the Title Page we are told, that he has made <HI>&s;everal curious Experiments and nice Ob&s;ervations, &s;uch as were never before made.</HI> Give me leave to challenge 2 or 3 of the&s;e nice Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. He endeavours to prove an Acidity in the&s;e Waters, and is led into the old <HI>German</HI> Error of the <HI>Acidulae.</HI> In Page 121. he &s;ays, <HI>Having taken about a quar|ter of a Pint of Milk, and cau&s;ed it to be heated, I poured into it whil&s;t it was warm about four Spoonfuls of the</HI> Ip&s;wich Spa, <HI>and it immediately turn'd it to Curds, as if Beer, or &s;ome mild Acid had been poured in.</HI> For my Part, I &s;hould much le&s;s e&s;teem his Water, if it were &s;o as he &s;ays, that it would turn Milk, and prov|ed it &s;elf an Acid; for Acids cau&s;e ma|ny Di&s;ea&s;es, and we fly to Alkalies for the Cure. But I &s;tand amazed at this A&s;&s;ertion of his, when I am morally certain of the contrary, and that there is no Chalybeat Water in <HI>England</HI> that is Acid, or produces this Effect on Milk.</P>
<P>But to give my &s;elf more Satisfaction, I procured &s;ome Bottles from the <HI>Ip&s;|wich</HI> Fountain, which came to my Hands full, well cork'd, and carefully &s;eal'd. I made the Experiment as above di|rected, but could not make any Curd
<PB N="64" REF="78">to ri&s;e: I made farther Experiments in Favour of the Water, I doubled and trebled the Quantity of the Water, to &s;ee if by any Means I could curdle the Milk, but nothing &s;ucceeded: Have a Care that you u&s;e new Milk, and do not mi&s;take a few Creamy, or Oily Par|ticks, that will &s;tick to the Side of any Gla&s;s, and call that Curd. Intere&s;t and Prejudice can di&s;cover what they have a Mind to.</P>
<P N="2">2. He runs much upon a volatile Acid, as if it were one of the grand Principles of his own, and even all mar|tial Waters. See Page 52. and in many other Places. Is it not &s;trange, that the Promi&s;er of &s;uch curious Experi|ments in the Title Page, &s;hould not put it upon this mo&s;t natural and ea&s;y Ex|periment in the World, which a very ordinary Chymi&s;t may perform? Why did he not (&s;ince he lives near the Spring) put a Quart or two of this Water into a Gla&s;s Limbec, (called Head and Body) or any other Still, and by a very gentle Fire receive the Liquor that came over, and &s;o ta&s;t and try it whether it held any Acidity or no? Does not this Omi&s;&s;ion put a Man ju&s;tly upon the Que&s;tion, whether
<PB N="65" REF="79">this Author has really a Mind to find out Truth or no? For my Part, I can tell him the Fate of this Experi|ment, that he will certainly di&s;til over an in&s;ipid Water, even from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t Drop in the Still, becau&s;e I have tried many &s;uch Waters as his this way, and none of them ever gave the lea&s;t Drop of an Acid.</P>
<P N="3">3. He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, and takes it for granted, that the fixt Salts that remain after Evaporation are Acid. It is &s;trange that this mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;upppo&s;ed, and not tried. I found in his Waters, which is the Condition of mo&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chalybeat Waters, that they contain very little Salt. Out of his <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> Wa|ter I could only get Two Grains from a Pint; I tried it with Milk, but it would not curdle half a Spoonful of Milk after &s;everal Days &s;tanding in a Window: I gained Five Grains out of a Pint of <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, (which Waters do hold more Salt than any o|ther of the true Chalybeat Waters. I have &s;een or heard of) I put the&s;e Grains to one Spoonful of Milk, which did keep the Milk, from curdling full Seven Days in <HI>September.</HI></P>
<PB N="66" REF="80">
<P N="4">4. He &s;ays he has experimented this, that his Waters have not only 14 Days, but as many Weeks, kept their intire Vertue. I wi&s;h he had try'd them whether they would carry to <HI>London,</HI> as far as the College of Phy&s;icians, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e which I &s;ent for did not carry Four Days, &s;o as to hold their Vertue; and truly by the cour&s;e <HI>Ocra</HI> I found at the Bottom, they &s;eem to me to re&s;emble <HI>I&s;lington</HI> Waters, which will lo&s;e their Vertue in 24 Hours.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid in the high Prai&s;e of the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters, being a Foreign <HI>German</HI> Water, mu&s;t certainly expo&s;e me to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of this Author; e&s;pecially &s;ince I have al&s;o in &s;ome low|er Degree ju&s;tified the Vertue of the <HI>Spa,</HI> when brought to us in a good Condition; and this I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that this la&s;t Year they have been brought us better than formerly; tho' I am &s;ure it is not in their Nature to pre&s;erve their Vertue as the <HI>Pyrmont</HI> will do.</P>
<P>Now I conclude with my hearty Wi&s;hes, that this Endeavour of mine to &s;erve my Neighbour may have &s;ome good Effect. I can a&s;&s;ure the Reader,
<PB N="67" REF="81">that a &s;incere Love of Truth, dive&s;ted of all Manner of private Intere&s;t, has been the only Motive of this Under|taking.</P>
<P>I pretend not to Infallibility, &s;ome Errors and Mi&s;takes, and &s;ome unju&s;t Cen&s;ures will attend every Writer; he that candidly convinces me of the former, &s;hall always have the Thanks of</P>
