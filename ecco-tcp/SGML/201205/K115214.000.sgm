<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE be&s;t Preface, in my Mind, that can be made to this Book is, a Quotation out of it&s;elf, p. 59. where the Author, as in a Sort of Corollary, drawn from his own Reflections, &s;ays:</P>
<P><Q>"From the Reflections that have been hitherto made, it may be ga|ther'd, that 'tis by no Means, an indifferent Matter in Practice, to
<PB N="vi" REF="3">adopt indifferently, the Sy&s;tem of the Rupture of the Ve&s;&s;els, or that of the Intru&s;ion of the Blood into the lymphatick Canals: It is of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, to chu&s;e either the one or the other, to li&s;t on one Side or the other, and to appear more than ordinarily engaged or concern'd therein. If the Di&s;pute here was only about &s;ome in&s;ipid, barren Point of Speculation, amu|&s;ing perhaps to the Curious, but altogether u&s;ele&s;s, and without In|fluence on Practice, tho&s;e who regard Things only as they are u&s;e|ful, might perhaps &s;lumber over
<PB N="vii" REF="4">it: But as our Bu&s;ine&s;s is here about a capital Point, which affects and concerns Practice to the highe&s;t Degree; &s;ince in the two Hypo|the&s;es the Manner of Cure is quite different; this ought to awake the Attention of all Practitioners, in&s;pire them with an extraordinary Reli&s;h for the pre&s;ent Subject, and rouze them totally out of their Indifference."</Q></P>
<P>And this &s;hould, indeed, rouze out of their Indifference, not only all Gentlemen of the Faculty, but even, methinks, &s;hould tempt all Gentle|men, who are (as all Gentlemen

<HEAD>CRITICAL REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>_WOMEN are &s;ubject to &s;uch regular Evacuations, that 'tis very hard to account for, and a&s;&s;ign the Cau&s;e there|of. Some have been of Opi|nion, that Nature, by this Flux, propos'd to purge the Blood of the Sex from the Impurities it contracts, thereby to render them more fruitful. Others, by ob&s;erving the Quali|ties of the Blood which Women in Health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e in their Cour&s;es, have been per&s;uaded, that 'tis &s;o far from being an Excrement, or Ma&s;s of Filth, that, on the contrary, it is a mo&s;t pure Blood, and of Con&s;equence, very fit and proper to nouri&s;h the <HI>Foetus.</HI> So much for the Final Cau&s;e, or End, for which the&s;e Flowings &s;eem ordain'd.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
<P>As for the Efficient Cau&s;e, the moving, or mechanick Principle, which, in the Fe|male Body produces the&s;e Effects, Men do not agree much better about this, than about the Final Cau&s;e, and are not much le&s;s divided in their Opinions, as to the Manner in which this Evacuation is made, than they are concerning the End, the Mo|tives and De&s;ign, which Nature may have in procuring it.</P>
<P>Some Authors, much devoted to A&s;tro|culture, and accu&s;tomed to trample under Foot &s;uch immediate Cau&s;es as they have ju&s;t at Hand, Objects that are too plain, fa|miliar, palpable, and natural for them to look upon but with Contempt, as Things common, ordinary, trivial; the&s;e Men erect the Moon for the efficient Cau&s;e, and make her ab&s;olute Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Cour&s;es in Que|&s;tion. Others, &s;omewhat more indulgent, and better di&s;po&s;ed towards &s;ublunary Cau|&s;es, have taken Care to make Cavities in the Womb, where they lodge in Ambu&s;cade a certain Ferment, or Leaven, which they have order'd to &s;ally regularly thence every Month, to attack the Blood in its Pa&s;&s;age, put the Humours all in Combu&s;tion, di&s;turb the Harmony of the Motions, the Exact|ne&s;s of the Functions, and, in fine, to play the little Devil, that, full of Malice, bent upon Mutiny, and breathing nought but wild Sedition, is never at Re&s;t, nor lays down his Arms, till he has rais'd in the
<PB N="3" REF="8">Blood a tumultuous Agitation, a di&s;orderly Efferve&s;cence, a more than ordinary Fer|mentation, and laid under Fire and Gore all the Region of the <HI>Matrix,</HI> which he makes a Field of Battle, that is, for &s;ome Days, to be quite overflown with Blood, and as the Object of his Rage, to appear alto|gether di&s;mal, and in Di&s;order. They who judge in the mo&s;t &s;imple, and mo&s;t natural Way, and, of cour&s;e, the neare&s;t to Truth, are tho&s;e who, after the famous <HI>Galen,</HI> ac|knowledge for Cau&s;e and Mover of this Flowing, the <HI>Plethora,</HI> or Abundance of Blood, among whom, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phy&s;ician, has mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf, in a Treati&s;e he has publi&s;h'd upon this Subject; which, tho' it be not exempt from Mi&s;takes (as we &s;hall ob&s;erve in the Sequel of this) is, however, in the main, a valuable Piece, both for the &s;ingular Clearne&s;s that &s;hines every where throughout the Performance (which makes its principal Merit) and for the great Num|ber of very excellent Rea&s;onings, and e&s;|&s;ential Ob&s;ervations, that we &s;ee there di&s;|play'd in the faire&s;t Light. If one will but vouch&s;afe to &s;toop a little, to &s;eek for Cau|&s;es in the &s;ublunary Empire, and not to be over-&s;mitten with the Charms of the Moon, and dazzled with her mighty Power; in fine, if we'll be impartial Judges, we &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;ide with <HI>Galen,</HI> and without He&s;ita|tion, give to the Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Plethora</HI>

<P>Women, in their Cour&s;es, do but di&s;|charge their Superfluity; and, to be con|vinc'd of this, it is enough to ob&s;erve, that after they have had the&s;e Flowings long enough, for In&s;tance, the Space of Five Years, they are no ways di&s;order'd thereby, but, on the contrary, they continue always alike, hold the very &s;ame State, enjoy the &s;ame Vigour, and, if you weigh 'em, you'll find 'em no lighter; and yet, in this Time, they have lo&s;t a Hundred Pound of pure&s;t Blood; as Lo&s;s! that &s;hould not only weaken them, but con&s;ume almo&s;t their whole Sub&s;tance, and reduce them to no|thing, were it any thing el&s;e but Superflui|ty. Now, if Women have this Redundan|cy of Blood, this is what we call the <HI>Plethora,</HI> and the Matter we are &s;eeking. There is therefore this <HI>Plethora,</HI> or Redun|dancy of Blood in Women; that is prov'd: But how, and by what Means is this <HI>Ple|thora</HI> contracted in the Per&s;ons of the Sex? This is what we now mu&s;t unfold in two or three Words; <HI>Women tran&s;pire le&s;s than Men;</HI> which is prov'd by four Reflections: 1&s;t. Their Bodies are more weak and ten|der; the Parts thereof le&s;s robu&s;t; the Texture of the Fibres more fine and &s;oft, and le&s;s proper for o&s;cillatory Motions; and, in fine, le&s;s vigorous; witne&s;s their gentle

<P>This is the Explication of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> and one can't help agreeing with him in this Part of it, that the <HI>Plethora</HI> contributes much to the Monthly Cour&s;es; at the &s;ame Time we mu&s;t al&s;o own, that notwith&s;tand|ing all the&s;e Advantages which we have ju&s;t now attributed to the Blood, yet it ought to be contain'd in a ju&s;t Mea&s;ure, and re&s;train'd to certain Bounds. We mu&s;t con|fe&s;s with <HI>Etmuller</HI> and <HI>Riverius,</HI> that an exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Plethora</HI> is more likely to &s;uppre&s;s, than to excite the Cour&s;es; nay, we may further a&s;&s;ert, that this is the mo&s;t u&s;ual, and almo&s;t the general Cau&s;e of the&s;e Sup|pre&s;&s;ions that afflict the Sex. The two fa|mous Phy&s;icians, we have ju&s;t now quoted, account for the&s;e Suppre&s;&s;ions by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive Redundance of Blood, which they make the Cau&s;e thereof, much in the &s;ame Manner as we impute the Stoppage of Urine to the too great Quantity of Liquor gather|ed in the Bladder; which Anology is judi|cious enough; 'tis true, it is not exact, it runs not upon all Four; becau&s;e (according to the Remark of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> who refutes it) the Bladder is much better furni&s;h'd than the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els are, being fortified with a Tunick firm and fle&s;hy, too &s;trong to be torn and broken by the Affluence of Urine, which coming there to lodge but in
<PB N="12" REF="19">a &s;low, indolent Manner, without any Im|petuo&s;ity, is not able to make any great Havock there; all that it does in this Ca&s;e, is &s;o to &s;tretch the Fibres of the Bladder, that they cannot come to them&s;elves again, and have not Freedom enough to contract in order to expel the Urine. That which al&s;o contributes a great deal to the Stop|page is, that the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder, to wit, the Mu&s;cle that &s;tops the Pa&s;&s;age thereof, has, in this Ca&s;e, all the Advan|tage, and remains Ma&s;ter of the Field of Battle, becau&s;e its Antagoni&s;t, namely, the Mu&s;cular Tunick, which &s;erves to drive out the Urine, being &s;tretch'd, dilated, con&s;train'd and hinder'd, has not Strength enough to counterbalance the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> much le&s;s to over-power it. In this re&s;pect, I &s;hall believe the Parallel betwixt the two Stoppages to be imperfect; but 'tis ju&s;t at lea&s;t in this, that it compares a Blood, which i&s;&s;ues not from the Ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e, oppre&s;&s;ing them by its Weight, it leaves them not Play enough to expel it; I &s;ay, as it compares this Blood to the Urine that remains in the Bladder, becau&s;e being there too abundant, it &s;o dilates the Bladder, that it cannot contract to drive it out.

He flatters him&s;elf, that this fine Phaenomenon about the Cour&s;es can no way be explain'd, but by his Principles; yet I have ventured upon other Principles, and the Sy&s;tem of the red Part of the Blood being engag'd in the Canals of its white Part, the prevailing Opinion of Dr. <HI>Helve|tius;</HI> and which he has &s;o much illu&s;trated on the Subject of the Small Pox, of which he has &s;o learnedly and u&s;efully treated: A Sy&s;tem! which gives Light into the Ex|plication of the Hemorrhages and Inflamma|tions, and which &s;o perfectly agrees with the animal OEconomy, and natural Mecha|ni&s;m.

<PB N="60" REF="69">the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, to chufe either the one or the other, to li&s;t on one Side or the other, and to appear more than ordina|rily engaged or concern'd therein.

Does it move it&s;elf? Has it in its own Stock wherewitha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to put it&s;elf in Play? Does it draw its Power from its own Choice?

That which hinders the&s;e from &s;trongly contracting, hinders al&s;o tho&s;e from fa&s;tening upon the thicken'd Humours; whence it &s;eems to follow, that the Blood cannot apply even the Velocity which it receives from the Emmenagogues to break the Ve&s;&s;els; becau&s;e the Remedies cannot animate it &s;o much as it &s;hou'd be, but with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ela&s;tick Ve&s;&s;els. They do not indeed import Fluidity; but this is not progre&s;&s;ive Motion, the Motion of Cir|culation, which is not to be obtain'd but by the &s;y&s;taltick Virtue of the Ve&s;&s;els. The Blood attenuated by Emmenagogues, may well become Fluid; but it cannot acquire Velocity, &s;ave only by being pu&s;h'd, beaten, and jerk'd along. According to Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> the Stroke of the Blood is that which makes its greate&s;t Strength: Now, the Stroke, that is to &s;ay, the Briskne&s;s of the Shock, the Violence of the Percu&s;&s;ion, does not preci&s;ely come from the Fluidity; but, becau&s;e the Fluid is &s;trongly &s;truck upon by the Solid, which Blows it again retaliates, and, in its Turn, re-buffets the Solid; there|fore, if the Ve&s;&s;els were flat and unactive, in Torture, and in Captivity, and the Fluids left to the &s;ole Action of the Attenuants, the&s;e Fluids would not receive Force enough wherewith to &s;trike upon the Solids; they would acquire but an indolent Fluidity,
<PB N="70" REF="79">only a Di&s;-union of their Parts, a Di&s;&s;oluti|on of their Ma&s;s, incapable of any great Effects; they could not contract that Impe|tuo&s;ity nece&s;&s;ary to give Strength to their Blow, Briskne&s;s to their Shock, Power and Force to their Percu&s;&s;ion. Our Author him|&s;elf deduces the Velocity of the Blood from the vehement Pul&s;ation of the Heart, and of the Arteries; a Pul&s;ation produc'd, as he &s;ays, by the Affluence of the animal Spirits: Whereas, the&s;e animal Spirits them|&s;elves can be nothing but the Work and Effect of the Spring of tho&s;e Parts that agitate and pu&s;h them to the Degree of Finene&s;s which they have. Therefore the Velocity of the Blood is the Effect of the Expul&s;ion of the Ve&s;&s;els; wherefore, it can|not make U&s;e thereof to break them: There|fore, if Emmenagogues excite the Flux of the <HI>Men&s;es,</HI> this cannot be by the Velocity which they impart to the Blood; but rather by the Swelling, the Rarefaction, the di&s;|orderly Turge&s;cence which they produce therein; by the Means of which the va&s;cu|lar Tunicks give way, not to the Force of the Percu&s;&s;ion, but to the Exce&s;s of their own Dilation. Another Difficulty might be &s;tarted again&s;t me; the Ve&s;&s;els, in the Effort they make to drive on with Swift|ne&s;s and Percipitation the Blood &s;ubjected to their Power, may they not break them|&s;elves?

It is not there|fore &s;trange, that the uterine Ve&s;&s;els, tho' vi|gorous enough to animate the Blood, &s;hou'd yield to the Blow of which them&s;elves are the Cau&s;e; and their Vigour, far from forti|fying and defending them again&s;t their Bur&s;t|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, only renders them more proper, more fit and di&s;pos'd for it. I own the Ve&s;&s;els may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">roken by their own Pains and Fatigue; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t mu&s;t be al&s;o confe&s;s'd, that it is by Accident when this Misfortune happens, and that the&s;e are Ca&s;es for which none undertakes to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nvariable Rules, and Geometrical Demon|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">trations, &s;uch as Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> has attempted to give us; there is too much Uncertainty in the Rupture of the Ve&s;&s;els; and 'tis too fortuitous a Ca&s;e, to draw and deduce thence an Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ure, &s;o con&s;tant, &s;o natural, &s;o regular, as the Phaenomenon of the Monthly Cour&s;es. Be&s;ides, the Rupture of the Ve&s;&s;els is not a thing &s;o common as one imagines; bleeding at the No&s;e, &s;pitting of Blood, Accidents very frequent and vulgarly attributed to Ruptures, don't &s;o much denote broken Ve&s;&s;els, but ra|ther &s;uch as meet di&s;charging Canals, that terminate in the Sanguines; and do not &s;o much declare the Extrava&s;ation of the Blood,
<PB N="72" REF="81">as its Pa&s;&s;age into the Emunctories. Why, indeed, &s;o few Ruptures in the &s;lendere&s;t, tendere&s;t Fibres within the Body, which are remote from Places of Di&s;charge, whil&s;t we di&s;cover &s;o many and &s;o often ju&s;t by the I&s;&s;ues, near the Excretories, and in the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, mo&s;t within the Reach of the Outlets, mo&s;t known and be&s;t remark'd? This Ob&s;er|vation ju&s;tly intimates that which is attribu|ted to the Rupture of the Canals, is u&s;ually but the Effect of the Intru&s;ion of the Blood into the Lymphaticks. The&s;e &s;eem to me the &s;tronge&s;t Objections that can be made again&s;t me; and the proper An&s;wers to be made to them: Dr. <HI>Freind</HI>'s Sy&s;tem, therefore, cannot be defended, and &s;till lies under the &s;ame Difficulties.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, can't flatter my&s;elf, that I have, with any Solidity, taken up &s;o learned a Man as Dr. <HI>Freind:</HI> What I have hitherto advanced I look upon it rather as a Web of Objections to be an&s;wer'd, than as a Critici&s;m to be redoubted: If I have not attack'd my Author with Advantage, I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the Glory of having &s;tudied him with Application. It is always good to betake our&s;elves to the be&s;t Authors, 'tis plea&s;ant to contemplate their Beauties; and even when we attack them un&s;ucce&s;s|fully, yet don't we apply thereto, without reaping an Advantage. But, &s;hould my Objections be made with &s;ome Foundation, I would not take it ami&s;s to be compared
<PB N="73" REF="82">to a rebellious Child, who battles its own Nur&s;e, becau&s;e, by her &s;ucculent and well-condition'd Milk, &s;he has &s;upplied him with the Strength to do it. Fo&s;ter'd by the Reading of Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> imbu'd with his Le&s;&s;ons, improv'd by his Knowledge, en|lighten'd by his Light, I have made u&s;e thereof again&s;t him&s;elf. I own, I &s;hould have had no Succe&s;s in engaging him, if I had not improv'd by &s;tudying him; if I had not gather'd my Knowledge from reading and meditating him; and if, before I made War upon him, I had not learnt my Di&s;ci|pline under him. If we gain a Victory over good Authors, 'tis becau&s;e them&s;elves &s;upply us with the Means to gain it.</P>
