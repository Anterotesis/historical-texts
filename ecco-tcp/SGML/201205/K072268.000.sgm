<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>RUPTURES of the uterus have been con&s;idered as accidents, mor|tal, for the mo&s;t part, in their nature. When part of the child remains <HI>in ute|ro,</HI> authors give &s;ome general directions for delivery; but agree in its fatal ten|dency, if the child has e&s;caped wholly into the cavity of the abdomen; con|&s;idering any attempts to deliver, except by the cae&s;arean operation, as fruitle&s;s. This was the opinion of Dr. Hunter: his high and de&s;erved reputation has &s;tampt &s;uch authority upon it, that prac|titioners in general give up their patient for lo&s;t, without attempting any thing
<PB N="4" REF="3">for her relief. The cae&s;arian operation, in this country, has been attended with &s;uch ill &s;ucce&s;s, that very few men are bold enough to recommend it, &s;uppo|&s;ing that it would only be an addition to the patient's &s;ufferings, without af|fording any pro&s;pect of relief.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas, phy&s;ician to the A&s;ylum, &s;ome months &s;ince, publi&s;hed a ca&s;e, where he &s;ucceeded in the delivery of a child from the cavity of the abdomen, and the woman recovered; from whence he infers, that tho&s;e accidents, which admit the child to e&s;cape through a rupture of the uterus, are not nece&s;|&s;arily fatal, and that the delivery is to be effected, without having recour&s;e to the cae&s;arean operation, with more ea&s;e than has been imagined.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e, which is now &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the public, was a laceration of the vagina, happening early in parturition: the circum&s;tances
<PB N="5" REF="4">of which having been clearly marked during the life of the patient, and con|firmed by di&s;&s;ection after her death, throws a new light upon this part of midwifery, and renders it probable that many ca&s;es deemed irremediable, from being con&s;idered as ruptures of the ute|rus, were only lacerations of the vagi|na, and admitted of effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e, having given ri&s;e to many doubts upon the &s;ubject of ruptured uterus, induced me to enquire how far authors in general have been accurate in their ob&s;ervations. Upon examining &s;uch ca&s;es as were in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I found, that many which are related as ruptures of the uterus, were in fact, la|cerations of the vagina. In&s;tances of which I &s;hall give in ca&s;es from Vander Wiel, Bonetus, Dr. Douglas, Pouteau, and others.</P>
<P>From a ca&s;e communicated to me by a friend, I am further enabled to give
<PB N="6" REF="5">&s;ome account of the circum&s;tances at|tending a laceration of the vagina, when, the head being &s;o low as to be wedged in the pelvis, the child did not e&s;cape into the cavity of the abdomen. On examining the circum&s;tances of &s;ome ca&s;es de&s;cribed as proceeding from rup|tures of the uterus, this appears &s;ome|times to have happened without being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations annexed, re&s;pecting the circum&s;tances in which lacerations of the vagina differ from ruptures of the uterus; in the e&s;cape of the child or placenta into the abdomen, and the ob&s;tructions to delivery; and the other practical inferences drawn, are &s;uch as, I hope, will merit the attention of prac|titioners.</P>
<P>As Dr. Douglas's ob&s;ervations on an extraordinary ca&s;e of ruptured uterus, is the late&s;t publication on the &s;ubject, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to advert to it
<PB N="7" REF="6">oftener than to any other. If it has been any means of di&s;pelling the idea of the impo&s;&s;ibility of recovery in acci|dents of this nature, which has &s;o long been the general received opinion, &s;up|ported by the highe&s;t authorities; I flat|ter my&s;elf, that the following pages will be a further inducement to di&s;pel our fears; as they tend to prove the great probability there is, that the e&s;cape of the child into the cavity of the abdo|men happens oftener from lacerations of the vagina, than from ruptures of the uterus.</P>

<HEAD><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">N EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF LACERATED VAGINA.</HEAD>
<P>ON Augu&s;t the 20th, 1786, I was de&s;ired by Mr. William Waller, of Go&s;port, to vi&s;it Mrs. Wilkins, with my partner Mr. Aylward. She was a patient of Mr. Waller's, and had been above twenty four hours in labour; after the membranes had broke, and the os internum been con&s;iderably di|lated, the labour pains &s;uddenly went off; the child's head could be no longer felt, and very dangerous &s;ymptoms had come on. We met there, in con&s;ulta|tion, his father and Dr. Waller.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>Mrs. Wilkins was a large woman, much u&s;ed to laborious exerci&s;e, of a dark complexion, about thirty-&s;ix years of age, inclining to be lu&s;ty; her con&s;ti|tution was naturally &s;trong, and general|ly healthy; &s;he was then in labour with her fourth child; her former labours had been always lingering, but was, at each time, delivered of a living child, without more than ordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. During the pre&s;ent pregnancy, &s;he was not able to move with &s;o much ea&s;e as with her former children, complaining of much pain in the left hypoga&s;trium.</P>
<P>We were informed by Mr. Waller, that he was called to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance about a fortnight before; but finding that the pains were &s;purious, he ordered her an opiate, which gave her relief, and &s;he continued ea&s;y until the preceding day; when being again &s;ent to, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, he then found her in labour; after waiting &s;ome time, the pains beginning to encrea&s;e, he made
<PB N="11" REF="9">an examination, and found that the os internum was dilated to the &s;ize of a crown piece. The membranes broke, and the waters were evacuated. Upon a further examination in the u&s;ual man|ner, the head was found to pre&s;ent; but being only able to reach it with the point of his finger, he could not exactly a&s;certain its &s;ituation, in re&s;pect to ver|tex or fontinel. Con&s;idering it a linger|ing labour, he waited for the efforts of nature. The child's head advanced by &s;low degrees; and, after &s;ome hours, the pro&s;pect of a more &s;peedy delivery &s;eemed to be apparent, by the further dilatation of the os internum, although the head did not appear to be much engaged in the pelvis. She was, about this time, &s;eized with a cramp in her left foot and leg, which afterwards ex|tended to her belly, on the return of every pain. While he was directing a camphorated anodyne liniment, ano|ther &s;evere pain came on, which cau&s;ed her to cry out mo&s;t vehemently, oh the
<PB N="12" REF="10">cramp, the cramp! and which, &s;he af|terwards &s;aid, &s;he believed was in her womb: this was &s;oon after followed by a di&s;charge of blood from the vagina, which continued for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Mr. Waller then ob&s;erved that the la|bour pains abated in their &s;trength, and that they were &s;ucceeded by &s;uch as are common in colic, with peculiar twi&s;t|ing in her bowels. He directed an emol|lient gly&s;ter, which was repeated with an anodyne; but not finding &s;o much relief from the&s;e as he expected, her pul&s;e being full and quick, he took away about eight ounces of blood from her arm, and left her about two o'clock, giving directions, that &s;he might be kept as cool as po&s;&s;ible, the weather being very warm.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her again, between four and five o'clock, and found that the true labour pains had not returned; but that, in addition to the other &s;ymp|toms,
<PB N="13" REF="11">&s;he then complained of con&s;ider|able thir&s;t; had vomited frequently; was very re&s;tle&s;s; in great pain when moved, and felt a great degree of pain when he put his hand upon her belly. Upon examining the &s;tate of the labour, he could feel no pre&s;entation, the child's head having receded. In this &s;ituation, he thought it proper to repeat the gly&s;|ter, and ordered her, in the evening, another anodyne, together with a &s;aline julep. With hopes that real and effi|cient pains would return by the morn|ing, he left her.</P>
<P>On vi&s;iting her in the morning, very early, her attendants informed him, that &s;he had been very thir&s;ty and re&s;tle&s;s all night; her vomiting had been more &s;e|vere, and that &s;he was in great pain when turned, complaining of a heavy lump which &s;ell from &s;ide to &s;ide; it did not appear from an in&s;pection of the cloths, that there had been any fur+ther hemorrhage; upon inquiring more
<PB N="14" REF="12">par|ticularly, it could not be found that &s;he had made any urine, except as it came away involuntarily.</P>
<P>On con&s;idering that there had been no return of real pains, and that the other &s;ymptoms were more urgent, he began to think that her ca&s;e was of a more &s;erious nature than he had at fir&s;t apprehended; he therefore thought it proper, to acquaint her friends with the opinion he entertained of the danger of her &s;ituation, reque&s;ting them to &s;end for &s;uch other per&s;ons of the faculty as they might wi&s;h &s;hould be con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>When we vi&s;ited her, which was about noon, we found her extremely re&s;tle&s;s, complaining of great pain about the region of the pubis; her face was covered with a cold &s;weat; her pul&s;e was moderately full and ra|pid; &s;he felt great anxiety about the praecordia; her breathing was thick and &s;hort, with inten&s;e thir&s;t, and continual
<PB N="15" REF="13">efforts to vomit. As it was ob&s;erved that &s;he had made no water for &s;ome time, except what, by the urinous &s;mell of the cloths, appeared to have come away involuntarily, we determined to introduce the catheter; but no|thing pa&s;&s;ed, except a little bloody &s;anies. The bleeding was repeated, and an antiphlogi&s;tic treatment agreed upon.</P>
<P>When we con&s;idered her &s;ituation more fully, and compared the &s;everal &s;ymptoms, of cramp and &s;ucceeding hemorrhage; the retroce&s;&s;ion of the child; her &s;evere thir&s;t; vomiting and great pain about the region of the pu|bis, with the &s;ymptoms which occurred in the ca&s;e of ruptured uterus publi&s;hed by Dr. Douglas; there was &s;uch &s;imi|larity between them, that we agreed in the propriety of introducing the hand for a more particular examination.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<P>We accordingly vi&s;ited her again about three o'clock, and Mr. William Waller proceeded to make an exami|nation. There was no difficulty in pa&s;|&s;ing his hand: upon the po&s;terior part he felt a con&s;iderable tumor, which was moveable, and which was not the child's head: he likewi&s;e found his hand in contact with the inte&s;tines; whence it was evident that our &s;u&s;picions were well grounded. Immediate delivery was the only means of relief, and his endeavours to get at the feet &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded; they were brought into the vagina, and &s;ecured with a noo&s;e; but it required a con&s;iderable degree of ex|ertion to di&s;engage the breech. After the arms were brought down, the head followed with ea&s;e, little or no di&s;|charge en&s;uing.</P>
<P>The child was large, and had been dead, no doubt, ever &s;ince its e&s;cape from the uterus. The placenta, which
<PB N="17" REF="15">was likewi&s;e in the cavity of the ab|domen, followed without any diffi|culty.</P>
<P>Not being determined as to the na|ture of the tumor, which Mr. Waller felt upon the po&s;terior part; as the woman had &s;uffered &s;o little in deli|very, we concurred in opinion, that he &s;hould again examine the &s;tate of the parts. Upon introducing his hand, he &s;oon &s;ound that the tumor receded be|fore his fingers, and that it was the contracted uterus. It was evident to him that the uterus was not ruptured; but that there was a laceration of the vagina, at the place where it is attached to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> through which his hand would pa&s;s with ea&s;e into the ca|vity of the abdomen. The os internum was &s;o contracted, that it would not ad|mit more than two fingers, and he was convinced that it had not been injured. She &s;ound her&s;elf con&s;iderably relieved when we le&s;t her at four o'clock. An
<PB N="18" REF="16">anodyne was directed to be taken in the evening.</P>
<P>&mdash; 21&s;t.&mdash;We vi&s;ited her early in the morning, when we found that her &s;pirits were good. Her attendants in|formed us, that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed a much better night than could have been ex|pected. She was capable of turning without any inconvenience; her thir&s;t, pain in the abdomen, and vomiting, were &s;till violent. Anodynes, with &s;alt of wormwood and lemon juice, to be taken during the efferve&s;cence, were di|rected for her. She had frequent &s;tools with tene&s;mus. The nur&s;e was ordered to let her drink be mint tea with rice gruel.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms evidently ari&s;ing from the injury done to the abdominal vi&s;|cera, by the child's remaining &s;o long among them, after its e&s;cape from the uterus, induced us to entertain &s;ome rays of hope, from the &s;ucce&s;s which
<PB N="19" REF="17">had attended the ca&s;e related by Dr. Douglas, that &s;he might recover; but the approach of the evening convinced us that our hopes were groundle&s;s. Every &s;ymptom was become more ur|gent, with a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation from globus hy&s;tericus; &s;he had made no water, and, from the uri|nous &s;mell of the cloths, we could not entertain the lea&s;t doubt but that the bladder was ruptured, &s;pecially when we called to our recollection, that the &s;ame had been ob&s;erved before delivery.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;tate, nothing was le&s;t for us to do, more than to alleviate her pain, and make the &s;mall remainder of her life as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible; for which purpo&s;e, her anodyne medicines were repeated.</P>
<P>&mdash;22d.&mdash;The per&s;ons who watched with her during the night informed us, that &s;he had been very re&s;tle&s;s; com|plained of great pain in her belly, with
<PB N="20" REF="18">inten&s;e thir&s;t, and that &s;he had been con&s;tantly vomiting. Her countenance was greatly altered; the quantity of fluid thrown up was out of all propor|tion to the quantity drank; the tene&s;mus &s;till continued, but without any evacu|ations; her anodynes were repeated, and an opiate gly&s;ter ordered to be in|jected in the evening.</P>
<P>&mdash;23d.&mdash;We found her more com|po&s;ed, and we under&s;tood &s;he had been &s;o through the greater part of the night. She continued in the &s;ame &s;tate until about eleven o'clock before noon, when &s;he died, perfectly &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>We obtained permi&s;&s;ion to open the body the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>The abdomen was much tumified. Upon making a longitudinal inci&s;ion through the integuments, a quantity of confined air ru&s;hed out. The perito|neum was inflamed, and in &s;ome places beginning to &s;phacelate. The inte&s;tines
<PB N="21" REF="19">were remarkably di&s;tended with flatus; their external coats were tinged with yellow, and inflamed through their whole extent. The ramifications of the ve&s;&s;els appeared of a beautiful red, as if they had been injected; &s;ome &s;pots were ob&s;erved in &s;everal places beginning to &s;phacelate, and they were for the mo&s;t part connected by a &s;light adhe&s;ion to each other. The omentum was con|tracted and inflamed. There was a con|&s;iderable quantity of bloody &s;erum in the cavity of the abdomen. The whole of the vi&s;cera had that appearance, which has been generally ob&s;erved on di&s;&s;ecting women who have died of a puerperal fever.</P>
<P>The uterus and its appendages, in &s;itu, appeared perfectly &s;ound, excepting the left ovarium, which contained about fourteen ounces of a colourle&s;s fluid, in a &s;ingle cy&s;t. There was no appearance of the <HI>ve&s;ica urinaria;</HI> on pa&s;&s;ing a ca|theter, it went immediately into the ca|vity
<PB N="22" REF="20">of the abdomen, confirming our &s;u&s;picion that the bladder was ruptured. On rai&s;ing the uterus above the pelvis, we were immediately convinced how accurate Mr. Waller had been in the de&s;cription he gave us, on examining the &s;tate of the parts directly after de|livery.</P>
<P>The os internum and cervix uteri were uninjured; the vagina was thin, and was lacerated tran&s;ver&s;ely on the &s;uperior part, clo&s;e to its attachment to the uterus: the laceration was nearly through one half of its circumference, on the fore part, but inclining to the left &s;ide. The bladder, from its connexion with the vagina, had &s;uffered at the &s;ame time, being ruptured through the whole of its po&s;terior part, at lea&s;t in propor|tion to the &s;ize of the laceration which had taken place in the vagina; we ob|&s;erved that it had extended to the outer &s;urface of the uterus, tearing off an an|gular piece of its peritoneal coat, about
<PB N="23" REF="21">half an inch in length. The uterus was contracted to the u&s;ual &s;ize it is ob|&s;erved to be, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace after delivery; its peritoneal coat near the fundus &s;hewed an appearance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uci|pient mortification. The os <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> was contracted, as Mr. Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;erved, &s;o that, without di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> could not introduce more than two fingers.</P>
<P>As the nature of the ca&s;e was evident, we did not proceed further in the di&s;|&s;ection, but contented our&s;elves with pre&s;erving the parts. On making an in|ci&s;ion into the uterus, it was found, in mo&s;t places, to be nearly an inch thick; its internal &s;urface appearing in a heal|thy &s;tate, and contained a &s;mall propor|tion of the membrana decidua, which had been left behind.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<P>LACERATIONS of the vagina have been mentioned by authors, as, &s;ometimes, happening from labori|ous parturition; but I do not recollect to have heard, or read any account, where the child had e&s;caped, by &s;uch means, into the cavity of the abdomen; or that they have ever conceived &s;uch an accident to be probable. I have &s;e|lected &s;ome ca&s;es, which are related as ruptures of the uterus, but which are apparently accidents of this nature. Thus can be reconciled, only, by the confu&s;ion into which authors have fal|len, in their divi&s;ions of this vi&s;cus.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts, at pre&s;ent, are pretty nearly agreed in dividing the uterus in|to fundus, cervix, and os internum. Suppo&s;ing that the whole of the uterus mea&s;ures three inches in length, they,
<PB N="25" REF="23">for the mo&s;t part, allow the fundus to oc|cupy the &s;pace of one inch and a quar|ter, the cervix to take up one inch and three quarters, and the os internum to project within the vagina about a quar|ter of an inch. But, when we con&s;ider how indeterminate they have heretofore been on this &s;ubject, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed, on examining &s;ome of the following ca&s;es, which are related as ruptures of the cervix, to find them la|cerations of the vagina. From the con|current te&s;timony of writers, it is evi|dent, that the vagina has been fre|quently con&s;idered as the <HI>collum uteri.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Ca&s;e of lacerated, vagina from <HI>VAN|DER WEIL,</HI> related, by him as a rup|ture of the uterus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE daughter of Jonas Pergo had been delivered of four children, having very difficult labours with all of them. While pregnant with the fifth, &s;he &s;uf|fered a con&s;iderable degree of unea&s;i|ne&s;s; her pains were much more ur|gent, when in labour, and came on earlier than in her former pregnancies, continuing with violence until the third day before delivery, when they cea&s;ed. The midwife could not, by any endea|vours, deliver her. The child, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been dead &s;ome
<PB N="28" REF="26">days, and which appeared afterwards to have been the ca&s;e, from the &s;epara|tion of the cuticle, pre&s;ented with its hands bent behind its neck, and the face obliquely upwards towards the pubis.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms becoming more and more violent, &s;he being not only faint and feveri&s;h, with oppre&s;&s;ion on the praecor|dia, attended with rigors; but having vomited up &s;ome green faeces, which aro&s;e, he &s;ays, from the foetus pre&s;&s;ing upon the rectum, &s;o that they could not find their pa&s;&s;age thence, Cornelius Solingius, an experienced &s;urgeon, was &s;ent for with him to her relief. In a &s;hort time, he delivered her of a dead child. As he could not ea&s;ily bring away the after birth, he introduced his hand along the funis, but found that it was in contact with the inte&s;tines, before it came to the placenta; which was &s;ound, &s;oon after, hanging down, in three parts, within the abdomen, out

<P>In the examination of this ca&s;e, I &s;hall confine my remarks to the delivery of the placenta, and the appearances upon di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P>After the child was delivered, Solin|gius, finding that the placenta did not ea&s;ily follow, introduced his hand along

<P>A review of the circum&s;tances, which follow the introduction of his hand, will elucidate the ca&s;e, when compared
<PB N="32" REF="30">with the appearances, which were ob|&s;erved on opening the body, after death.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place. No mention is made of any difficulty in introducing the hand through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus, which mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable, from its con|tracted &s;tate, if the attempt had been made.</P>
<P>Secondly. As his hand came imme|diately in contact with the inte&s;tines, if the placenta had been within the uterus, the inte&s;tines mu&s;t likewi&s;e have been within it, which does not by any means appear from the narrative.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly. If his hand had been within the cavity of the uterus, how could he have judged of the degree of its contraction, &s;o as to have thought it, at fir&s;t, to have been a &s;cirrhus?</P>
<PB N="33" REF="31">
<P>If we con&s;ider the ca&s;e as a partial &s;eparation of the vagina, from its at|tachment to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> then every one of the&s;e objections are &s;urmounted with ea&s;e: his hand, on pa&s;&s;ing along the funis, would have found an ea&s;y in|troduction into the cavity of the abdo|men, and he would have been in con|tact with the inte&s;tines, before his hand arrived at the placenta. The uterus would have been found on the anterior part, and have felt contracted like a ball, &s;o that, at fir&s;t, it might have been mi&s;taken for a &s;cirrhus; neither of which could have po&s;&s;ibly happened if his hand had been within its cavity: be&s;ides, his expre&s;&s;ion is &s;o clear, in re&s;pect to its contraction, 'dure admo|dum compactum atque <HI>in &s;e</HI> contrac|tum comperit,' as to leave no room to &s;uppo&s;e any thing to have been included within it.</P>
<P>We find that on di&s;&s;ection, after re|lating the external appearance of the
<PB N="34" REF="32">abdomen, and what i&s;&s;ued on making an inci&s;ion into it, he pa&s;&s;ed his hand, he &s;ays, <HI>per vulvam,</HI> and again felt the inte&s;tines; and, what is very material in forming a determination on the na|ture of the ca&s;e, found the uterus re|ceding above the pubis, '<HI>recedentemque</HI> &s;upra os pubis uterum reperit.' To u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of Dr. Douglas, in his late, publication, <Q>'it fled before the tips of his fingers.'</Q></P>
<P>I think it mu&s;t be evident to every one, that the uterus would not have re|ceded before his hand, if its attachment to the vagina had remained entire. It mu&s;t have re&s;i&s;ted the touch.</P>
<P>The place where the rupture is &s;aid to have been was at the inferior and po&s;terior part, a little above the os in|ternum, where the common peritoneal membrane is continued from the rectum to the uterus.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="33">
<P>Now the &s;ame peritoneal coat which &s;urrounds the whole of the abdominal vi&s;cera, in its pa&s;&s;age from the rectum to become the external coat of the ute|rus, is inflected over that part of the vagina which is attached to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> beginning to form the peritoneal coat of the uterus, at the place where the vagina is joined to the cervix, a little above the os internum. In the &s;ame place, on the anterior part, the vagina was lacerated in the ca&s;e before related; and, I think, on comparing the different parts of Vander Wiel's rela|tion, with each other, it is clear that the injury, in both ca&s;es, was nearly &s;imilar; the only difference being, that in one the laceration was in the po&s;terior, and in the other in the anterior part of the vagina.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Ca&s;e of lacerated vagina, as related by <HI>BONETUS,</HI> from <HI>LEONARDUS DOL|DIUS.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the year 1594, a woman of Hage|naw, in Al&s;ace, 40 years of age, who had been the mother of &s;even children, at the full time, but all of them born dead, died in labour of the eighth, on the third day, without being delivered. The night before, her pains had been violent in the extreme; the women who were pre&s;ent made many efforts to de|liver her, but they were not able to afford her the lea&s;t help.</P>
<P>On opening the body, they were very cautious in making their inci&s;ion into the abdomen, that they might have a
<PB N="37" REF="35">di&s;tinct view of the uterus <HI>in &s;itu.</HI> The mu&s;cles were hardly divided, when the back of the child was wounded. They had no &s;u&s;picion of what it really was, &s;uppo&s;ing it, at fir&s;t, to be the u|terus; but, on continuing the inci&s;ion, they found it to be a full formed foetus (with &s;igns of putridity from the &s;epa|ration of the cuticle) without the uterus, in the cavity of the abdomen. It lay with the face to the &s;acrum, and its body extended at full length. At fir&s;t, nothing preternatural was ob&s;erved, there being no appearance of contu|&s;ion, wound, ulceration, or ab&s;ce&s;s. They wondered much at the &s;ingularity of the ca&s;e; but this was cleared up when they &s;ound the uterus torn, rup|tured, or rather broken off.</P>
<P>The child was &s;till connected by the &s;unis to the &s;ecundines, which were re|tracted, upon the left &s;ide, towards the &s;pleen, and adhered &s;o fa&s;t that they had &s;ome difficulty to &s;eparate them.
<PB N="38" REF="36">The uterus was &s;o contracted, that it did not exceed the &s;ize of the placenta. Near the cervix, directly under the bladder, there was a portion of mem|brane hanging down, about the thick|ne&s;s of the di&s;&s;ecting knife, and not exceeding the breadth of half a palm, which was a part of the &s;eparated ute|rus, <HI>'uteri abrupti.'</HI></P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The ca&s;e of <HI>Mrs. Manning,</HI> as related by <HI>Dr. DOUGLAS.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE find that the woman, who is the &s;ubject of this ca&s;e, was in her 4th preg|nancy, low in &s;tature, about 30 years of age, and of a weak con&s;titution, but, in general, healthy. When the Doctor was fir&s;t called to her, the membranes had been ruptured eight hours, and the pains had continued regular from that time: yet though the os tincae was con|&s;iderably
<PB N="40" REF="38">dilated, the child did not ad|vance. He found her extremely re&s;t|le&s;s, complaining of exce&s;&s;ive pain in the region of the pubis. Each return of pain cau&s;ed her to writhe and twi&s;t as if &s;uffering from violent colic, very unlike the urging throes of common la|bour; but her pul&s;e was calm and re|gular, nor did &s;he make any particular complaint, excepting of the pain about the pubis. This being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, there &s;eemed to be no rea&s;on to induce him to precipitate the delivery.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock the &s;ame evening, the midwife informed him that the pa|tient had had a di&s;charge of blood from the vagina, which, however, did not continue; and that the pains had cea&s;ed about half an hour after &s;ix o'clock; &s;ince which, retching, with an ince&s;&s;ant craving for drink, had come on.</P>
<P>He now found her face lengthened, and bedewed with cold &s;weat; her pul&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="39">&s;carcely to be felt; her breathing &s;hort and quick, with great anxiety; but &s;till complaining of no pain, excepting about the pubis. <Q>'By examination in the com|mon way,' he &s;ays, I could di&s;tingui&s;h nothing, excepting a round moveable &s;ub&s;tance, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the head of the child; but being only able to reach it with my fingers, I could not determine with any certainty what it was. The woman appeared to be <HI>in extremis;</HI> and my mind was &s;o wholly occupied by her danger, as to preclude all rea&s;oning with re&s;pect to the cau&s;e.'</Q> He determined upon immediate delive|ry, as the only chance of relief. <Q>'There was no difficulty,' he &s;ays, 'in pa&s;&s;ing my hand; and the &s;ub&s;tance which I had &s;uppo&s;ed to be the child, fled before the tips of my fingers: by following it, I at la&s;t found my hand in a cavity, which in no &s;ort re&s;embled that of the uterus. I was then forcibly and painfully &s;truck with the nature of the ca&s;e; and on ex|amining all round, with caution and
<PB N="42" REF="40">gentlene&s;s, I could with certainty de|termine that my hand was in the cavity of the abdomen: the child being on the fore part; on the back part, the con|tracted uterus like an oblong ball; and the inte&s;tines hanging among any fin|gers.'</Q> There was no ob&s;truction to the turning and extraction of the child, excepting in the pa&s;&s;age of the head through the brim of the pelvis. The placenta, which was likewi&s;e in the ab|dominal cavity, had &s;o clung to the in|te&s;tines, that he was again under the nece&s;&s;ity of introducing his hand to de|tach it, which was not difficult. <Q>'The uterus &s;eemed,' he &s;ays, 'to have been ruptured tran&s;ver&s;ely, on the lower and fore part, &s;ome di&s;tance above where the vagina is connected with it; and it was more contracted in its &s;ize, than I thought po&s;&s;ible in the few hours which had elap&s;ed &s;ince the accident.'</Q></P>
<P>After a variety of changes and alarm|ing &s;ymptoms ari&s;ing from peritoneal
<PB N="43" REF="41">inflammation, the poor woman fortu|nately recovered; and in about &s;ix weeks waited upon the Doctor at his own hou&s;e, to return thanks; when he per&s;uaded her to permit his neighbour Dr. O&s;born to examine <HI>per vaginam.</HI> He thought the os tinae &s;omewhat more open, ex|ternally, than it u&s;ually is; and Dr. Douglas him&s;elf fancied he felt rather more fulne&s;s than is common about the <HI>cervix uteri:</HI> but they both agreed, that there was nothing in the touch &s;o dif|ferent from what is ob&s;erved in the na|tural &s;tate, as to have excited any idea of previous di&s;ea&s;e, had they not known the complaint with which &s;he had been afflicted.</P>
<P>After examining the body of Mrs. Wilkins, and a&s;certaining the nature of the injury, I began to con&s;ider the above ca&s;e in a different light, from what I did on the fir&s;t peru&s;al of it. The Doctor repre&s;ents it as a ca&s;e of ruptured ute|rus;
<PB N="44" REF="42">I now perceive it to be a ca&s;e of lacerated vagina.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance which he relates, of a <Q>'round moveable &s;ub&s;tance,'</Q> which upon introducing his hand, he found to be <Q>'the contracted uterus like an ob|long ball,'</Q> was &s;o &s;imilar to what Mr. Waller de&s;cribed, and which every one of us had an opportunity of ob&s;erving during the di&s;&s;ection, that I have no doubt remaining in my own mind, that there could have been any difference between the two ca&s;es. Mr. Waller and the other gentlemen who were pre&s;ent concur likewi&s;e with me in the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>In the preceding pages, I have had occa&s;ion, on a review of the ca&s;e from Vander Weil, to advert to a &s;imilar oc|currence, when I expre&s;&s;ed my doubts how the degree of contraction can be a&s;certained, unle&s;s the hand of the ac|coucheur
<PB N="45" REF="43">has been pa&s;&s;ed on the out&s;ide of the uterus. I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that, while the fundus is contracted above the rupture, the os internum will remain for &s;everal hours, nay days, dilated, and &s;hew no di&s;po&s;ition to contract. The fibres, I &s;hould apprehend, which form its texture, will a&s;&s;i&s;t its contraction in as great a degree as that of the fundus.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas, as well as Vander Weil, found that the uterus receded on intro|ducing his hand. Is it po&s;&s;ible that the uterus &s;hould have receded before his hand, if its attachment had been entire? It mu&s;t have made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. Yet we find that, when he touched it, it fled, and upon following it, his hand went, not into the uterus, but into a cavity which in no &s;ort re&s;embled it. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed from this relation, &s;o point|edly marked, that his fingers ever pa&s;&s;ed the os internum? The uterus mu&s;t have been fixed, if he had entered into its cavity; but he &s;ays, that he was obliged
<PB N="46" REF="44">to follow it, and at length found his hand within the abdomen, the child being on the fore part, on the back part the contracted uterus, like an oblong ball.</P>

<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A ca&s;e of lacerated vagina, where the head was engaged in the pelvis, before the accident took place; communi|cated by a friend.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A. B. aged about 30, was taken in labour with her third child, on April 15th, 1785, at four oclock in the morn|ing.
<PB N="50" REF="48">The waters &s;oon came away. On examination, the head of the child was found to be low in the pelvis. A con|&s;iderable &s;tricture was ob&s;erved in the vagina, and the &s;acrum projected rather forward at its apex. About five hours after &s;he was fir&s;t taken in labour, &s;he began to complain of pains in her belly, which &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of labour. At three oclock in the after|noon, a phy&s;ician, an eminent teacher of midwifery in London, was called in, at which time, from the degree of &s;tric|ture, the part of the head which pre|&s;ented could not be exactly a&s;certained. He ordered her an injection, which was given, but without any effect. On en|quiring, it appeared, that &s;ince &s;he be|gan to complain of the pain in her belly, the labour pains had cea&s;ed. A &s;ingle blade was introduced with ea&s;e, and &s;ome endeavours made to deliver, but without &s;ucce&s;s. The Doctor, con|&s;idering it wrong to &s;truggle again&s;t na|ture, or do any thing without the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
<PB N="51" REF="49">of pains, left her, giving directions for an enema to be injected, and four or &s;ix ounces of blood to be taken away.</P>
<P>He returned at half pa&s;t five, when very little alteration could be perceived. She had no labour pains, and the pains continued the &s;ame in the abdomen, which &s;he now complained was become tender. Injections were ordered, copious and &s;timulant; four were given without any return. The forceps were at length applied, and u&s;ed moderately, with an intent to bring on a return of true pains; but a &s;light di&s;charge of the gly&s;ters was the only effect. A little ground was at length gained, and, by encrea&s;ing the force for a con&s;iderable time, &s;he was delivered of a dead child: the placenta came away immediately after. She made water frequently during the la|bour, and had it drawn off before the u&s;e of the forceps. She was thir&s;ty, and vomited frequently, though little in quantity. By her cries, &s;he did not &s;eem
<PB N="52" REF="50">to &s;uffer more pain, than is u&s;ually felt in her delivery.</P>
<P>Her pul&s;e were quick after &s;he was in bed; &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to vomit, and pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night; the pain in her belly continued di&s;tinct from after pain. She lived until the morning of the 18th, during which time her pul&s;e were gene|rally 130 or more, her &s;kin hot, &s;he com|plained of great pain and tenderne&s;s of the abdomen; &s;he vomited frequently, and her urgings to vomit were great.</P>
<P>From no local injury being &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, and from the pre|&s;ence of the lochia, and other &s;ymp|toms, the ca&s;e was con&s;idered as truly puerperal, and treated as &s;uch.</P>
<P>On di&s;&s;ection, the inte&s;tines were found to be inflamed, with an exudation of lymph on their &s;urfaces, and the gall bladder was large and di&s;tended with bile. The uterus was contracted to the
<PB N="53" REF="51">&s;ize of double fi&s;t, black, and begin|ning to &s;phacelate. The vagina was found to be lacerated at its connexion to the <HI>cervix uteri,</HI> anteriorly, no ve&s;|tige of the &s;tricture remaining<NOTE PLACE="foot">Although, in the ca&s;e which gave ri&s;e to the&s;e ob|&s;ervations, the bladder was unfortunately injured, yet it does not follow, that this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen always; for in this ca&s;e we &s;ee, that a laceration may take place on the anterior part, without its being injured; and from other ca&s;es we are taught, that the po&s;terior or lateral parts are as often liable to the accident, as the anterior part of the vagina.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that the woman had fallen down, a day or two before &s;he was taken in labour, and that the &s;ame gentleman had delivered her, two years before, with forceps, on account of the &s;ame &s;tricture.</P>
<P>How far the &s;ixth ca&s;e quoted by Dr. Douglas might be &s;imilar to the above, I have &s;ome doubts; but the circum&s;tances attending it render it probable.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="52">
<P>It appears, that the woman had been in labour the be&s;t part of the day, with very &s;trong pains, before the rupture is &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken place. The head was firmly wedged in the pelvis; but, in attempting to open it, &s;uddenly gave way to the force applied.</P>
<P>Now, let us con&s;ider for one moment the nature of the ca&s;e. If a rupture had taken place in the uterus, as the head was firmly wedged in the pelvis, the feet mu&s;t have been the part pro|truded; whence, when I recollect the &s;trong contractile power of the uterus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a part of the child only has e&s;caped through a rupture of the uterus, the contraction, as related by authors, is great. Hildanus gives a ca&s;e where the head of a child had pa&s;&s;ed through a rupture of the uterus, which had contracted &s;o &s;trongly round its neck, that, he &s;ays, it had no doubt been &s;trangled by it.
<P>Hildani Centur. i. ob&s;erv. 54.</P></NOTE>, and the length of time intervening be|tween the attempt to open the head, and the time when the rupture is &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="55" REF="53">to have happened, I cannot per|&s;uade my&s;elf that the child would have e&s;caped &s;o ea&s;y into the cavity of the abdomen as he found it did.</P>
<P>If the vagina was lacerated, it is ea&s;y to account for the &s;udden retroce&s;&s;ion of the child. It is evident, that the ute|rus being only attached in one place, its re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure could only be partial; the fundus would be inclined, and the os internum rai&s;ed in proportion; therefore, when the head was pre&s;&s;ed back, it would find an ea&s;y admittance, through the laceration, into the cavity of the abdomen; from the endeavours of the uterus to free it&s;elf, the body with the placenta would &s;oon follow. The rupture being near the cer|vix is, I think, &s;ome &s;upport to what I have advanced. I &s;hall likewi&s;e endea|vour to &s;hew, in another place, that the placenta being in the cavity of the ab|domen, may be con&s;idered as a collate|ral proof.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="54">
<P>I AM inclined to believe, that the whole of the child very &s;eldom e&s;capes from a rupture of the uterus. I am, however, very well convinced, that it is always the con&s;equence of a laceration of the vagina, unle&s;s it &s;hould happen to be as firmly wedged in the pelvis as in the ca&s;es I have ju&s;t noticed.</P>
<P>On a review of fifteen ca&s;es quoted by Dr. Douglas, we &s;hall find, that the child e&s;caped into the cavity of the ab|domen in &s;even; in No. VI. VII. X. XI. XII. XIII. and XIV. I have already endeavoured to &s;hew that No. VI. and XI. were lacerations of the vagina, and I &s;hall draw &s;ome inferences from No. XII. when I come to &s;peak of the pla|centa being out of the uterus, tending to &s;how a degree of probability of that being of the &s;ame nature. Of No. VII.
<PB N="57" REF="55">we have a very uncertain account, as, from motives of delicacy, it is not par|ticularly entered into. No. X. without doubt, mu&s;t have been a ruptured ute|rus. I think that the two la&s;t cannot be con&s;idered in point, as they were at an early period of ge&s;tation, and the acci|dents happened from external violence.</P>
<P>In the remaining eight, No. I. II. III. IV. V. VIII. IX. and XV. only part of the child had e&s;caped from the rup|ture; indeed, in the two fir&s;t, it does not appear that any part had e&s;caped. It is therefore evident that, &s;etting a&s;ide the two ca&s;es from external violence, in only one out of thirteen the child e&s;|caped wholly from a rupture of the uterus.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o inclined to believe, that the placenta being in the cavity of the ab|domen, is an occurrence which very &s;el|dom happens, excepting in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the vagina is lacerated. The
<PB N="58" REF="56">&s;ize of the rupture, when it happens in the uterus, mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed almo&s;t immediately after the child has e&s;caped, and the contraction of the uterus mu&s;t be encrea&s;ed by its endeavours to pro|pel the placenta; it is therefore almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that the placenta &s;hould e&s;|cape into the abdomen: it might indeed &s;ometimes happen, if the funis &s;hould be much twi&s;ted round the child's neck or body. In almo&s;t every ca&s;e, where we have a certainty that the accident was a rupture of the uterus, we find that the placenta remained behind.</P>
<P>When a laceration takes place in the vagina, the propul&s;ion of the placenta is not different from what happens in common parturition; as every contrac|tion of the uterus forces it towards the os internum, from whence it pa&s;&s;es after the child into the cavity of the abdo|men. But when there is a rupture in the uterus, every contraction mu&s;t be an impediment to its propul&s;ion, by di|mini&s;hing
<PB N="59" REF="57">the &s;ize of the aperture, thro' which it mu&s;t pa&s;s, to be found among the vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of Mrs. Wilkins, where we can entertain no doubt of the nature of the accident, the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the ab|domen. In that of Mrs. Manning, in tho&s;e from Vander Weil, Bonetus, and Pouteau, and in the &s;ixth ca&s;e quoted by Dr. Douglas, all of which I have en|deavoured to &s;hew were of the &s;ame na|ture, the placenta was likewi&s;e found among the vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>There are two more in&s;tances, among the ca&s;es quoted by Dr. Douglas, where the &s;ame occurrence is &s;aid to have hap|pened; in No. X. and XII.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, communicated by Dr. Garth|&s;hore, is again&s;t the opinion I have form|ed, that being, as I have before ob&s;erved, evidently a rupture of the uterus. In the
<PB N="60" REF="58">other, from Saviard, it appears, that the child pre&s;ented favourably, with every appearance that the labour would be &s;oon fini&s;hed; yet the pains cea&s;ed at once, after two days continuance; the pre&s;enting part receded, and only the placenta was to be felt. She died un|delivered; and when the body was opened, the child and &s;ecundines were in the abdomen among the vi&s;cera, the feet of the child touching the &s;tomach of the mother. The inte&s;tines were all fretted, and the omentum rotten and &s;tinking, but the uterus was of the na|tural appearance. I have not Saviard's book to refer to; but I think, from a re|view of this account, I &s;hall be able to draw &s;ome inferences in my favour.</P>
<P>From the manner in which he ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, that the uterus was of its natural appearance, we may be led to &s;uppo&s;e that no injury had happened to it. When we recollect the circum|&s;tance, that, after the pre&s;enting part
<PB N="61" REF="59">had receded, the placenta alone was to be felt, I apprehend but a &s;mall degree of doubt concerning the nature of the ca&s;e will remain.</P>
<P>After the body was opened, the &s;e|cundines as well as the child were found in the abdomen. As the placenta was to be felt on examination, after the rupture had taken place, how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the rupture was in the uterus? The uterus mu&s;t have been at that time con&s;iderably contracted, and the aperture &s;o much dimini&s;hed, as to have rendered the e&s;cape of the pla|centa impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Hence I am clearly of opinion, that the placenta being felt on examination, after the rupture had taken place, and being afterwards found in the abdomen, is a great proof that the accident was not in the uterus, but in the vagina.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="60">
<P>Out of eight ca&s;es, therefore, where the placenta was found with the child in the cavity of the abdomen, there is the greate&s;t probability to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;even of them were lacerations of the vagina.</P>
<P>THE difficulty attending delivery, when the vagina is lacerated, mu&s;t be very trifling, when compared to that which will occur if the accident hap|pens in the uterus. In the ca&s;e of Mrs. Wilkins, the only re&s;i&s;tance was in bringing down the breech, which all the gentlemen pre&s;ent agreed aro&s;e from the protuberance of the child's belly projecting over the fundus of the contracted uterus; which, as the extrac|tion went on, was brought lower down, and, of con&s;equence, pre&s;&s;ed the breech of the child over the pubis: after this was overcome, not the lea&s;t difficulty
<PB N="63" REF="61">whatever occurred. In the ca&s;e of Mrs. Manning, it does not appear that there was any re&s;i&s;tance to the delivery of the breech; but we find there was a con&s;i|derable ob&s;truction in the pa&s;&s;age of the head through the pelvis. I am &s;ome|what inclined to believe that this might have ari&s;en from the &s;ame cau&s;e, al|though Dr. Douglas &s;uppo&s;es it to have proceeded from the narrowne&s;s of the pelvis.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the uterus has been ruptured, the difficulty will be en|crea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, in proportion as more or le&s;s of the child has e&s;caped into the cavity of the abdomen.</P>
<P>If the rupture &s;hould be &s;o exten&s;ive as to admit the child to e&s;cape entirely out of the uterus, from the natural di&s;|po&s;ition of its fibres, the uterus will al|mo&s;t immediately contract, and the &s;ize of the rupture will become le&s;s, of con|&s;equence, in proportion to the degree
<PB N="64" REF="62">of contraction which takes place. If the rupture &s;hould be &s;o &s;mall as to ad|mit the protru&s;ion of part of the child only, a &s;tricture will be formed upon &s;uch part as has e&s;caped, which will re|quire a con&s;iderable degree of force to overcome, as, from its endeavours to expel the part which remains, the ute|rus will &s;till continue to contract. In performing the cae&s;arean operation, M. Soumain found that the edges of the in|ci&s;ion made in the uterus pre&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e upon the foetus, that he could hardly get his fingers in to extract it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. Chirurg. Paris, mem. xx.</NOTE>. Hence we may account for the alternate though ineffectual pains, which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, have been ob&s;erved to continue for &s;ome time after the rupture has taken place; and I believe we may be led to form a probable opinion that, when this hap|pens, &s;ome part of the child &s;till re|mains within the uterus.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="63">
<P>The hand of the accoucheur, when he &s;its down to deliver, mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed through the os internum into the cavity of the uterus, and from thence through the rupture. The difficulty attending the pa&s;&s;age of the hand will be in pro|portion to the degree of contraction; but, unfortunately, it is very &s;eldom that the nature of the ca&s;e is known &s;o early, as to induce us to make any at|tempt to deliver before the uterus is con&s;iderably contracted. After the re|&s;i&s;tance from the dimini&s;hed &s;tate of the rupture is overcome, and the hand pa&s;|&s;ed into the abdomen, the feet, in gene|ral, may be &s;oon found, and brought down with &s;ome ea&s;e; but as the ope|rator proceeds, and the legs come for|ward, every inch of the child, as the extraction takes place, will create a fre&s;h re&s;i&s;tance from its increa&s;ing bulk. The irritation which mu&s;t be given to the uterus, by the introduction of the hand, will increa&s;e its endeavours to contract, and make con&s;iderable addition to the
<PB N="66" REF="64">difficulty. Caldani, of Bologna, in a letter to Haller, relates &s;ome experi|ments made on the uterus of a bitch, which &s;how the great degree of contrac|tion that takes place even after death, on any &s;timulus being applied to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Van Swieten's comment. &s;ect. 1316.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The nearer likewi&s;e the rupture hap|pens to the fundus or cervis, the greater degree of ea&s;e or difficulty will en&s;ue. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the extraction will be made nearly in a direct line. In the other, and which mo&s;t commonly hap|pens, that part of the child which re|mains in the abdomen mu&s;t form an angle with the feet and legs, while they are pa&s;&s;ing through the vagina, and the degrees of &s;uch angle will be decrea&s;ed or increa&s;ed, in proportion as the rup|ture may happen to be, either near the cervix, or further towards the fundus.</P>
<P>Very little more exertion will be re|quired than what is obliged to be made
<PB N="67" REF="65">u&s;e of in a common ca&s;e, where the child is turned, when the feet are the only parts that have e&s;caped. When the legs have protruded as far as the knee, the re&s;i&s;tance will be con&s;idera|bly more powerful; as, in &s;uch ca&s;e, the hand mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed to a greater di&s;tance through the rupture in &s;earch of the feet: but how much more mu&s;t the difficulty be increa&s;ed, if the aper|ture &s;hould be large enough to admit the child to pa&s;s out of the uterus as far as the hips? Indeed I apprehend this &s;ituation to be wor&s;e than when the whole of the child has e&s;caped; as, in that ca&s;e, there may be &s;ome hope that the re&s;i&s;tance might be overcome, and the child extracted by the feet; but when the child has e&s;caped as far as the hips, &s;uch a very con&s;iderable di&s;ten&s;ion, if not further laceration of the rupture, mu&s;t take place, and &s;o great a degree of force mu&s;t be made u&s;e of to over|come the contraction, in order to gain &s;ufficient room to bring the feet back, as
<PB N="68" REF="66">leave little room to hope for &s;ucce&s;s. In fact, when I reflect on the very great difficulties that mu&s;t ari&s;e when any con&s;iderable part of the child has e&s;|caped, I do not at all wonder that au|thors have concurred in pronouncing the accident mortal, and giving no en|couragement for attempting relief, ex|cept by having recour&s;e to the cae&s;arean operation.</P>
<P>In addition to Mrs. Manning's ca&s;e, of which we have had occa&s;ion to &s;peak &s;o often, eight others are adduced by Dr. Douglas, to evince the ea&s;e with which delivery may be performed in ca&s;es of ruptured uterus. No. I. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. and XV. On read|ing them over with attention, I have ob&s;erved that the &s;ituation of the child, in mo&s;t of them, was &s;uch as to create the &s;maller degree of re&s;i&s;tance, accord|ing to the opinion I have entertained in re&s;pect to the difficulty attending de|livery.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="67">
<P>In the fir&s;t, which was related to Hei&s;|ter by Rungius, it does not appear that the child, or any part of it, had ever been in the cavity of the abdomen. Indeed Dr. Douglas is of the &s;ame opi|nion him&s;elf, as he &s;ays, <Q>'the recovery of the patients, No. I. and II. may have been in a great mea&s;ure owing to the vi&s;cera having &s;u&s;tained little or no in|jury, as there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the child in either ca&s;e had been in the cavity of the abdomen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ob&s;ervat. on extr. ca&s;e of rupt. uter. p. 66.</NOTE>.'</Q> This may give us &s;ome idea of the pro&s;pect we have of recovery when a rupture takes place, but cannot be brought to &s;how the ea&s;e with which delivery may be performed, when the whole or part of the child has e&s;caped from the uterus.</P>
<P>In No. IV. which is taken from La Motte, <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> 317, the feet were the only parts out of the uterus, and the rupture was at the fundus; whence
<PB N="70" REF="68">the extraction was not attended with much difficulty, for two rea&s;ons: the endeavours made u&s;e of were in a di|rect line, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and in the &s;econd, the feet being the only parts that had e&s;caped, the hand of the accou|cheur was introduced until it came to the knees, &s;o as to bring them down and di&s;engage the feet; after which, no more difficulty would ari&s;e than what happens in a common ca&s;e of turning.</P>
<P>In No. V. likewi&s;e from La Motte, <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> 318, it appears that the child had e&s;caped out of the uterus as far as the hips, or even further, part of the body being in the cavity of the abdo|men. The child was turned, he &s;ays, and extracted with con&s;iderable ea&s;e; <HI>en moins d'un mi&s;erere,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;es it him&s;elf. I cannot think, with Dr. Douglas, that La Motte's ob&s;ervations are related with &s;uch plainne&s;s and can|dour, as to claim our mo&s;t perfect con|fidence. In this in&s;tance, we have a
<PB N="71" REF="69">ca&s;e the mo&s;t difficult that can po&s;&s;ibly happen, and yet the delivery was per|formed with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imagi|nable. I really am of opinion, that the relation is not founded in fact: I ap|prehend that he has either magnified the proportion of the child which was out of the uterus, or that he has con|cealed the difficulty he mu&s;t have met with, in ca&s;e &s;uch a con&s;iderable part of the child had been in the abdomen.</P>
<P>I have advanced &s;ome rea&s;ons, in a former part of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, when &s;peaking of the head of the child being wedged in the pelvis, at the time when a laceration happens, tending to &s;how that No. VI. was a laceration of the vagina.</P>
<P>We have a very defective account of No. VII. as from motives of delicacy to the gentleman who attended the pa|tient, Dr. Douglas does not think him|&s;elf at liberty to enter more particular|ly into it.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="70">
<P>In No. VIII. from Peu, the time elap|&s;ed between the accident and the deli|very is not related; but I am inclined to believe that it was done very &s;oon after, from the apparent facility with which it was accompli&s;hed. There ap|pears likewi&s;e &s;ome deficiency in the contractile power of the uterus, by the exce&s;&s;ive hemorrhage that followed. We find however that he <Q>'delivered with great caution to avoid doing further in|jury to the uterus.'</Q> This &s;eems to inti|mate &s;ome degree of re&s;i&s;tance, altho' none is mentioned.</P>
<P>Dr. Douglas ob&s;erves, that the great contractile power of the uterus is fa|vourable to the proce&s;s of healing, by bringing the divided parts more into contact; <Q>'but,' he &s;ays, 'the pre&s;ence of any con&s;iderable extraneous &s;ub|&s;tance, even in the abdomen, &s;eems, in &s;ome degree to counteract this power of contraction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">'s ca&s;e of ruptured uterus, p. 56.</NOTE>.'</Q> If the uterus after the expul|&s;ion
<PB N="73" REF="71">of its contents, does not con|tract as in common parturition, we mu&s;t expect a con&s;iderable flooding. In the above ca&s;e, we are told that it was ex|ce&s;&s;ive. In the ca&s;es of Mrs. Wilkins, and the others which I have related as lacerations of the vagina, the hemorrhage was not very great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a con&s;iderable hemorrhage will follow, however, from a laceration of the vagina, as well as from a rupture of the uterus, we have the authority of Ve&s;lingius. 'Bis enim notavi, cum uteri vagina, &s;ecundum latus dextrum e&s;&s;et di&s;rupta, quamvis foetus extinctus integre cum &s;ecun|dis educeretur; &s;ub&s;equente ex laceratis hypoga&s;tricis va&s;is enormi &s;anguinis profluvio, matrem paulo po&s;t fato pari|ter ce&s;&s;i&s;&s;e.'&mdash;J.

<P>In No. IX. from Steidele, it appears that the head had e&s;caped from the rupture, he brought down the feet with ea&s;e, but found &s;ome difficulty in ex|tracing
<PB N="74" REF="72">the re&s;t of the foetus. This dif|faculty mu&s;t evidently have ari&s;en from the &s;tricture formed by the edges of the rupture round the child's neck; whence I think it cannot be con&s;idered as much &s;upport, to evince the ea&s;e with which delivery is performed, any more than the la&s;t ca&s;e, where the patient expired while the accoucheur was endeavouring to bring the head through the pelvis.</P>
<P>LACERATIONS of the vagina, I have before ob&s;erved, have been taken notice of by authors, yet it does not appear that they have had any idea of the child's e&s;caping by &s;uch means into the cavity of the abdomen. If the ca&s;e which gave ri&s;e to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, in which the nature of the accident could not be mi&s;taken, and my rea&s;oning on the dif|ferent ca&s;es I have adduced, are allow|ed
<PB N="75" REF="73">to have any weight, I think I may venture to draw the following conclu|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the whole of the child e&s;|capes, into the cavity of the abdomen, much oftener from a laceration of the va|gina than from a rupture of the uterus.</P>
<P>Secondly, That, from the little diffi|culty with which delivery is accompli&s;h|ed in lacerations of the vagina, there is a greater pro&s;pect of recovery in &s;uch accidents, than when the uterus is the &s;eat of the injury.</P>
<P>It is evident that the gloomy idea of inevitable death has not only been the means of checking &s;uch endeavours as might have been &s;ometimes &s;ucce&s;sful, but that it has likewi&s;e been often the means of preventing us from knowing the real nature of the injury. I hope practitioners in future will, from the for|tunate event of the ca&s;e of Mrs. Man|ning,
<PB N="76" REF="74">related by Dr. Douglas, and the new light thrown on the &s;ubject by the ca&s;e I have related of Mrs. Wilkins, entertain a more favourable opinion of the &s;ucce&s;s likely to attend their endea|vours, in a &s;ituation where nothing but immediate delivery can afford the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of recovery.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t I made my private remarks on Mrs. Wilkins's ca&s;e, I did not intend to enter further into the &s;ubject, than to draw the ca&s;e up &s;air, and &s;end it to &s;ome periodical publication, as worthy the attention of the medical world. But the &s;imilarity between it and that of Mrs. Manning was &s;o &s;triking, that the more I con&s;idered it, the more rea&s;ons I &s;aw to induce me to publi&s;h it in the pre|&s;ent form.</P>
<P>The nature of the &s;ubjct has obliged me to enter very fully into the merits of Dr. Douglas's ca&s;e. That he &s;hould be liable to cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> in forming an opinion
<PB N="77" REF="75">on the nature of the accident, is not to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider how &s;ilent authors have been upon it, and how &s;eldom accidents of this nature oc|cur. I have not the honour of being known to him; but I am confident, from the liberality of his &s;entiments as a gentleman, that he will not con&s;ider the liberty I have taken as per&s;onal, or in any other light than as a di&s;charge of the duty every man in the profe&s;&s;ion owes to the world. It has a claim upon us to elucidate any occult part of the &s;cience, and every man is bound by the laws of humanity to comply with it, whenever an opportunity offers.
