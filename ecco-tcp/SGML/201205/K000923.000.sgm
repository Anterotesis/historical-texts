<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THIS SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not from any Vanity of appearing in Print, e&s;pecially a &s;econd time, af|ter &s;uch ungenerous U&s;age as I have met with from Per&s;ons calling them|&s;elves Reviewers, but to make my&s;elf u&s;eful in my Generation to unhappy Suf|ferers, as far as I am able. I refu&s;e not the poore&s;t Per&s;on my A&s;&s;i&s;tance (as well as the Rich) if they come to my Hou&s;e. The Plea&s;ure I feel by relieving the Af|flicted, overbalances all the Cavillings,
<PB REF="4">Sneers, and ill-natured Reflections of Reviewers, or any other Writers for Bread, who &s;peak Evil of the Things that they under&s;tand not. Let them an|&s;wer me by &s;olid Arguments, confirmed by as many real Cures as I have done; then I &s;hall rejoice to hear &s;o many more mi&s;erable Objects have been relieved from their Di&s;orders by my &s;tirring up the Attention or Ambition of others to Practice with more Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>As the King's Evil is a Di&s;ea&s;e few of the better Sort care to own, I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from naming &s;uch Per|&s;ons, but only &s;ome few of their Ca&s;es. As to the lower Sort, I &s;hall give their Ca&s;es in the plaine&s;t Manner I can, that the People of common Under&s;tanding,
<PB REF="5">without any Phy&s;ical Knowledge, may in a great Mea&s;ure judge whether their Complaints are Scrophulous or not. I have al&s;o in&s;erted the Names, and Places of Abode, of &s;uch Per&s;ons, that by di&s;cour&s;ing with the Parties them|&s;elves, their Friends or Neighbours, they may be &s;atisfied of the Truth of the Matters of Fact, and receive far|ther Information as to their own Com|plaints. And as I make no Profit by my Practice, it is evident, I need no Arts to influence People to declare Un|truths in my Favour. Greater Num|bers of Cures I might have added, but hope the&s;e will be &s;ufficient, to &s;ati&s;|fy any unprejudiced Per&s;on, that the King's Evil, or other Scrophulous Di&s;|orders, may be relieved much oftener,
<PB REF="6">and with more Ea&s;e and Safety, as well as with le&s;s Charge to the Patients, than the Generality of Practitioners are willing to allow, or the unhappy Suffe|rers have hitherto experienced.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_A LADY of my Family having many Years made it her Plea&s;ure, to endea|vour the Relief of all &s;uch poor Per&s;ons as were afflicted with &s;cro|phulous Di&s;orders, or the King's Evil, and were recommended to her by Surgeons, or other Practi|tioners; and having been very &s;uc|ce&s;sful in curing many &s;uch Ca&s;es, as they had given up and recom|mended to her, made me very in|qui&s;ite with her after her Method of Practice. She very readily in|formed me of the Nature and Way of applying her Remedies, but would never (during her Life) im|part to me the Names of the Things &s;he made u&s;e of, or the Method of Preparation, but always told me
<PB N="iv" REF="8">I &s;hould find a full Account among&s;t her Papers after her Death, which I did (being her &s;ole Executor.) With other Things, I found the following Letter to her, from an eminent Surgeon.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>I ONCE more &s;ollicit your hea|venly Benediction, and the &s;alu|tary Effects of your renowned Secret, which the World is from God and your&s;elf, greatly obliged for, in Behalf of this poor un|happy Lad (<HI>B. P.</HI> by Name) who is attended with the King's Evil in his Foot, and has been &s;o for eleven Months; who I entirely &s;ubmit to your Care (Providence being your peculiar Guide) in the mean while, I remain in Confor|mity to Facts,</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="v" REF="9">
<P>THIS Letter, among many others, from Surgeons and Apothe|caries, together with the great Cures which &s;he daily did, made me very &s;eriou&s;ly reflect, how u&s;eful a Per|&s;on &s;he had been to all the human Species, which had applied to her in Time, being chiefly of the lowe&s;t Cla&s;s of Mankind, who&s;e Health and Limbs were their only Liveli|hood: The&s;e were often relieved with her Pur&s;e, and always with her Medicines, and Advice Gratis; as al&s;o all others, who applied to her for Relief in this deplorable Malady. The&s;e Con&s;iderations, and the great Number of unhappy Poor, (unable to pay a Surgeon or Apo|thecary) daily pre&s;enting them&s;elves to me; and I knowing the Safety of the Method, and Medicines u&s;ed in this Di&s;order, was imboldened to endeavour the Relief of my Fellow-Creatures, by following the Lady's
<PB N="vi" REF="10">Rules of doing good, for Charity Sake; which I have followed &s;ome Years, with &s;uch Succe&s;s (for which I thank God) as &s;urprizes even my own &s;elf. Such Objects of Com|pa&s;&s;ion having been relieved, as pa&s;s all Belief of any, but &s;uch as have been Eye-witne&s;&s;es of the Facts, from fir&s;t to la&s;t. Since I have been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the decea&s;ed Lady's Notes and Memorandums, I have read over many Authors who have treated of this Di&s;order. <HI>Dr. Gibbs</HI> on this Subject, writes, "That if we take a View of what the mo&s;t emi|nent Authors have &s;aid of this Di&s;|ea&s;e, we &s;hall find their Notions of it to be of little U&s;e, and very few Accounts of their Succe&s;s in curing Di&s;orders of this Nature." And tru|ly I am much of the &s;ame Opinion. But this great Good have I learnt by reading their Works, and from thence ob&s;erving the Operations of
<PB N="vii" REF="11">my own Pre&s;criptions, that I have much improved both the Method and Medicines I at fir&s;t u&s;ed. I pre|&s;cribe no painful Applications, cut|ting or cauterizing, bli&s;tering, or nau&s;eous Loads of Phy&s;ick, but &s;uch Things only, as Children of half a Year old, to the Aged of Seventy, may have without the lea&s;t Hurt or Pain, and with great Safety be ad|mini&s;tred to them. And I can iu&s;tly challenge any Per&s;on that has been under my Care, and followed my very ea&s;y Directions only, to allege the contrary. So that I can, with great Truth a&s;&s;ert, That I have done &s;ome Good, and no Harm. The Cure of this Di&s;temper by the Lady's Method, is no new Thing, but has been in &s;ome Mea&s;ure u&s;ed one hundred and fifty Years ago, as I have met with in an old Au|thor; and having &s;een &s;uch won|derful Effects from it, admire what
<PB N="viii" REF="12" MS="y">can be the Rea&s;on of its being for|got, &s;hall I &s;ay, or not u&s;ed by the Gentlemen of the Faculty: But it is not according to their Method of Practice. That I am no Phy&s;i|cian, Surgeon, or Apothecary, the Reader will ea&s;ily &s;ee, by my not u&s;ing hard Words, or technical Terms of Art, to puzzle and con|found him; and my Patients all know I am none of the Faculty, by refu&s;ing Fees. All that come to me, are welcome to my Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance Gratis. What Nece&s;|&s;aries are wanted, they may buy of whom, and where they plea&s;e. The inward Plea&s;ure I enjoy on &s;eeing any poor Sufferers relieved by my Means, makes me very ample Sa|tisfaction for all the Pains I can take for their Recovery.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="tract proper">
<P>_THE Scrophula, or what is vul|garly called the King's Evil, I &s;hall now con&s;ider. The Word Scrophula (&s;ays a learned Writer) &s;ignifies a praeternatural Tumour or Humour, produced by a particular Acidity of the Serum of the Blood, either in Gland, Mu&s;cle, or Membrane, which it both coagulates and indurates, or in the Mar|row, which it always di&s;&s;olves, and al&s;o putrifies the Bone. Let us con&s;ider a lit|tle this Definition: It &s;ays, it is a prae|ternatural Tumour, or Humour; who doubts the Truth of the King's Evil, Tu|mours and Ulcers being contrary to the Intention and De&s;ign of Nature, and con&s;equently are praeternatural? Next it
<PB N="10" REF="14">&s;ays, it is produced (that is, a Tumour or Humour) by a particular Acidity of the Se|rum of the Blood. This &s;eems indeed to be the general Opinion of mo&s;t Authors I have met with on this Subject, who u&s;ually follow each other, like Pack-Hor&s;es in the &s;ame Track: But that other Cau&s;es may have the &s;ame Effects, I &s;hall by and by endeavour to demon&s;trate. The Nature of Acidity, according to this Definition, both coagulates and indurates. Coagu|lation is performed on Milk by Acids, that is, turning the Milk into a Curd, it &s;uppo&s;es the Acidity, or Sourne&s;s of the Serum of the Blood does the &s;ame, that is, curdles in the fine Ve&s;&s;els it enters into. But becau&s;e Vinegar, Lemon Juice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are acid on the Tongue, mu&s;t they be &s;o in the Blood? What mad Work mu&s;t Vinegar, or other Acids produce, mixt with it, let every one judge? Pray think what Quantities of Vinegar <HI>Newmarket</HI> Jockeys drink for a Month or two toge|ther, to reduce them&s;elves to a proper Weight for Riding Races, and then tell me of any In&s;tance of the Scrophula be|ing produced by that Regimen. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="11" REF="15">if this was the Ca&s;e, why &s;hould not the Serum be as &s;oon coagulated or curdled in the large Ve&s;&s;els as in the finer? which we &s;ee it is not, though the Serum of the Blood contains a proportional Quantity of this particular Acidity in the large Ve&s;&s;els, as well as in the &s;mall: And I am apt to think, that the larger the Quantity of Liquor, the &s;ooner it will turn &s;our, and more &s;harp the Acidity; which I take to be the Rea&s;on, why the Vinegar Makers u&s;e &s;uch large Ca&s;ks, even to the holding a hundred Barrels of Liquor in one Body.</P>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved my Patients that have had Sores or Ulcers in their Mouths or Throats, have never complained of, or perceived any Sourne&s;s or Acidity of Ta&s;te, from the purulent Matter they have &s;pit out, though I have been very inqui&s;itive in that Particular, but they have always de|clared they had a very &s;alt Ta&s;te from the Matter di&s;charged by Spittle.</P>
<P>THAT there is in the Spirit of human Blood a great Ho&s;tility (according to Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>) or an Antipathy in reference to Acids, has been plainly intimated, and likewi&s;e to many Sorts of Acid Spirits,
<PB N="12" REF="16">as of Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Nitre, Spi|rit and Oil of Vitriol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not only again&s;t factitious Acids, but natural ones too, which he proves by many Experi|ments, as the Curious may &s;ee in his Na|tural Hi&s;tory of human Blood, where he al&s;o &s;ays, as far as he has been able to ob&s;erve, the Spirit of human Blood is manife&s;tly preferable to that Cla&s;&s;is, that many call Volatile Alcalies, becau&s;e it makes &s;uch great Conflicts with divers Acid Spirits, as Spirit of Salt, Aqua For|tis, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it will immediately turn Sy|rup of Violets from blue to green, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> performing &s;uch other Things, that may be expected from Volatile Alcalies as &s;uch. And he &s;eems &s;trongly to intimate, that there are very few (if any Acid Particles at all) in the Blood, or even in the dige&s;|tive Ferment of the Stomach. But that great Quantities of Volatile alcalious Salts are contained in the Spirit of human Blood, he proves by many undeniable Experi|ments, which if true, mu&s;t naturally de|&s;troy all Acidity in the Blood it&s;elf; &s;o that con&s;equently, it cannot be a particu|lar, or any Acidity at all in the Blood, that produces the Scrophula.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="17">
<P>THOUGH Spirit of Salt and Oil of Vi|triol (which are &s;trong Acids) will pro|duce a Curd-like Sub&s;tance dropped into the Serum of the Blood, &s;o will Oil of Tartar per Deliquium (which is a &s;trong alcalizate Salt) and al&s;o highly rectified Spirit of Wine, and many other alcalious Sub&s;tances, do the like.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it appears, that there can be no Acidity at all in the Blood: But much Alcaline Salt there is very capable of producing all the Symp|toms and &s;crophulous Complaints attend|ing this Di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE Induration &s;poken of in the &s;ame Definition, I take to be only the Curd|like Matter, hardned by Length of Time, and thru&s;t or &s;queezed clo&s;er together by the Addition of more of the &s;ame Mat|ter. That the Marrow in the Bones is di&s;&s;olved, I have had no Opportunity to ob&s;erve, by not &s;eeing any Amputation performed in this Di&s;order. That the Bones often &s;cale, and throw off Honey|comb-like Exfoliations, or Pieces, and are al&s;o much corroded, I have frequently met with. But why will not a &s;harp
<PB N="14" REF="18">coro&s;ive Salt cau&s;e this Corro&s;ion on hu|man Bones, as well as common Sea Salt on the &s;ofter Bones and Gri&s;tle-like Sub|&s;tances of raw Beef, when long &s;alted in the Pickling-Tub? I make no doubt but it will.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on why this Di&s;ea&s;e is called the King's Evil, as I apprehend, is be|cau&s;e it has been often cured by the Royal Touch of our Kings in this I&s;land, from <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or's Time (and how long before I have &s;een no Account) down to the late Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign. This has been the Subject of much debate among&s;t the Learned, becau&s;e great Cures have been &s;ometimes effected that Way, when other Means have mi&s;carried; and other Means have often &s;ucceeded, when the Royal Touch has failed. What then &s;hall we &s;ay? In my humble Opinion, there is &s;omething in the Nature of Gold it&s;elf very beneficial in this Di&s;order, I don't mean laid into the Hand of the Phy&s;ician by Way of Fee, or pocketed by a Surgeon or Apothecary, but worn about the Patient's Neck, by a white Sat|tin Ribband, hanging down to the Pit of
<PB N="15" REF="19">the Stomach. How often are Gold Ear-rings and Gold Beads for Necklaces worn for what People call Kernels, in and about the Neck and Throat, and for &s;ore Eyes, which are all common Appearances in this Di&s;temper, and not without &s;ome Benefit, as I believe many young Women can te&s;tify?</P>
<P>I VERILY believe that Gold being con|tinually worn at the Pit of the Stomach, next the Skin, has often had great and good Effects, but then People will not attend with Patience enough the Succe&s;s of &s;uch a gentle operating Remedy; for no doubt, but the fine Effluvia of the Gold being con&s;tantly heated by the Sto|mach, and continually rubbed again&s;t it, will in&s;inuate many of its fine Particles through the Pores of the Skin into the Blood and Spirits, and mixing in Time with the Juices of the Body, have very &s;alutary Effects. But then I would re|commend a Piece of fine Gold, without alloy, as large as a 36 <HI>s.</HI> Piece, to be u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e. But this is too charge|able an Application for my poor Patients U&s;e, though I &s;incerely think in many
<PB N="16" REF="20">Ca&s;es it would be very beneficial, e&s;pe|cially to young Subjects, who&s;e Stomachs are warm, and the Di&s;ea&s;e in its Infancy. Scrophulous Ca&s;es, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> may be ranked among&s;t the <HI>opprobria Medico|rum,</HI> or Scandal of Phy&s;icians; and after his De&s;cription of the Di&s;temper in its various Appearances and Effects, con|cludes; I could wi&s;h our learned Chirur|geons in this Ca&s;e, would make their ut|mo&s;t Applications, for the Di&s;covery of &s;ome Specifick, to correct this Humour. You &s;ee, this learned Gentleman ingeni|ou&s;ly owns, the Nature and Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e was very little known by any of the Faculty in his Time.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> &s;ays it exceeds the Penetration and Capacity of human Under&s;tanding, to unravel and di&s;play tho&s;e anomalous Clues and Convolutions proper to &s;trumous Swellings, and to &s;et their Nature and Con&s;titution in a clear and di&s;tinct View; and that the acute&s;t Men cannot penetrate and clearly unfold the e&s;&s;ential Difference of this Di&s;ea&s;e. This, I think, &s;ufficiently &s;trengthens Dr. <HI>Leigh</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations of the &s;mall Progre&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="21">that has been made in the Nature and Cure of the King's Evil. Having but ju&s;t mentioned the Opinions of the&s;e two learned Phy&s;icians, for more particular Accounts I refer the Reader to their Works, and &s;hall proceed with my own Thoughts and Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>SETTING a&s;ide then the Doctrine of Acid and Alcaly, let us con&s;ider the Na|ture of Salts, and whether they are capa|ble of producing the Complaints and Ap|pearances appendent to &s;crophulous Di&s;or|ders. That human Blood abounds with great Quantities of Volatile Salts (is &s;uffi|ciently demon&s;trable by ob&s;erving only the Sweat and Urine) which are compo&s;ed of Corpu&s;cules, or Particles of very differing Shapes and Sizes, as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> clearly proves, who after many Experiments, has found, that the&s;e &s;aline Concretions exhi|bit very different Appearances; &s;ome are &s;trait, &s;ome crooked, with various Inter|ferings, repre&s;enting Branches of Trees, Hart&s;horn, Feathers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet, &s;ays he, the&s;e &s;eem not to be con&s;tant Repre&s;enta|tions depending upon the particular Na|ture of human Blood, but ca&s;ual Figura|tions that depend upon &s;everal accidental Cau&s;es and Circum&s;tances. Now this Scrophula is very often an hereditary Di&s;|ea&s;e, and conveyed by Parents: How fine then mu&s;t the Seeds (if I may &s;o call
<PB N="18" REF="22">them) of this Di&s;temper be? yet &s;o it is. As every Acorn contains an Oak rapt up within its Surface, till Time and Vege|tation di&s;cover its Trunk and &s;preading Branches; &s;o is it with this Di&s;order. If the Seeds are born with us, they lie dor|mant in our Blood till a proper Time and a convenient Di&s;po&s;ition of that Liquor, and the nervous Juices of the Body, cau&s;e them to grow and expand into grievous Complaints, and terrible Symptoms.</P>
<P>THE Blood, which &s;eems to be the principal Seat of this Di&s;order, is divided into two Parts; the one called the Fibrous, con&s;i&s;ting of great Numbers of fine &s;mooth red Globules, continually floating in the other, which is a clear lympid Liquor, called the Serum, or &s;erous Part, which conveys the&s;e fine Globules to all Parts of the human Fabrick, in &s;ome Degree or other. Now if any of the&s;e red Glo|bules are broken change their Figure, or are ob&s;tructed in their Pa&s;&s;age by the Serum becoming glutinous, or being in too &s;mall or too large a Quantity, or di&s;|ordered by any praeternatural Commotion or Ferment, the Circulation through the fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els will be the fir&s;t impeded and hindered, as in the Glands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now think, if it is not agreeable to Rea&s;on, that as the Globules and Serum of the Blood may both contain a larger Portion
<PB N="19" REF="23">of the&s;e Volatile Salts when the Blood is di&s;ordered by any praeternatural Cau&s;e; and may not the&s;e Salts &s;hoot into very different Figures and Sizes from what they were in their natural State, according to the Nature of the Humours or Di&s;tem|pers that are latent in the Blood? And as the&s;e Salts are frequently of very per|plexing and entangling Figures, may we not rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e irre|gular figur'd Bodies (carried along in the Road of Circulation) by cro&s;&s;ing and en|tangling each other, may cau&s;e Stoppages and Ob&s;tructions in the fine Tubes and Strainers of the Body, as the Glands par|ticularly are? And by a continual Acce&s;|&s;ion of the&s;e perplexing Bodies, di&s;tend the ob&s;tructed Ve&s;&s;els (by Length of Time) into Tumours, which are often indurated or hardened, till &s;ometimes by their cor|ro&s;ive Quality they fret their Way through the Skin, and break into Ulcers. What can this proceed from, but the red glo|bular Particles, or fibrous Part of Blood, being &s;topped by the figur'd Salts, and the &s;erous Part &s;train'd as through a Net or Sieve from the fibrous? The Serum for want of the&s;e &s;mooth red globular Particles being mixed with it, becomes clear, tenacious, and &s;izey, the minute Parts of the Serum not being &s;ufficiently &s;eparated and divided by tho&s;e &s;mooth
<PB N="20" REF="24">Globules as before, and rubbing again&s;t each other, are thereby rendered acrimo|nious and fretting, and become produc|tive of grievous Complaints, hard to be removed. Tumours and Ulcers gene|rated by the&s;e or the like Means, are brought to a good Dige&s;tion with great Difficulty, and very probably not till the remaining red globular Particles of the Blood can be again mixed in &s;ome De|gree with the clear Serum, and form one circulating Fluid of Blood and Spirits as before, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be effected by melting, ab&s;orbing, altering or removing tho&s;e &s;aline acrimonious Particles that formed the Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider likewi&s;e the fi|brous Part of the Blood, or red Glo|bules, which being unable to pervade or pa&s;s this Rete or Strainer produced by the&s;e irregular figur'd Salts, and to ac|company the Serum in its Progre&s;s, are there &s;topped, and being &s;pqueezed and crowded clo&s;e together for want of this Liquor to float them forward through the fine Ve&s;&s;els, ob&s;truct the Spirits, putrify and turn into a Curd-like Sub&s;tance, till it is dige&s;ted by Art or Nature into a &s;oft Pus or Matter, and &s;o expelled its Ne&s;t. What is more common than to &s;ee large &s;crophulous Ulcers (e&s;pecially in the more fle&s;hy Parts) look of a deep red Colour
<PB N="21" REF="25">far round their Lips or Edges, which I apprehend to proceed from the&s;e red Globules being &s;eparated from the Serum, and &s;tagnating in tho&s;e Parts, until a proper Dige&s;tion is procured, and then the Redne&s;s gradully di&s;appears, and at the &s;ame Time you may often ob&s;erve a clear tran&s;parent Liquor &s;tand in dewy Drops on that red Surface of the Skin through which it has exudated? Which I think a &s;ufficient Demon&s;tration that the &s;erous Part of the Blood is in this Di&s;|order &s;trained or &s;eparated from the fi|brous, and vi&s;ible even to the naked Eye. And I have always found by Experience, that as the Quantity of this clear limpid Liquor has decrea&s;ed, the Ulcer has di&s;|charged a more laudable Pus, the Red|ne&s;s in&s;en&s;ibly worn off, and then the Ulcer has healed up with very little Ap|plication more than dry Lint.</P>
<P>SHOULD I attempt to mention all Parts &s;ubject to this Di&s;order, I mu&s;t name every individual of the human Fabrick, for I know of none exempt from this ter|rible Malady, no not even the Bones them&s;elves; for in my Cour&s;e of Practice I have had this verified by repeated Ob|&s;ervations: I have had a Patient afflicted with Tumours and Ulcers from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, and in above twenty different Places be|&s;ides
<PB N="22" REF="26">at once, the major Part of which have been cured by the Application of dry Lint only, and the Remainder by very &s;imple Applications, and but very little Phy&s;ick. But &s;uch bad Ca&s;es re|quire much Time to make a perfect Cure. For any-body mu&s;t think, that a Di&s;ea&s;e brought into the World with one, and &s;o interwoven with the Con&s;titution, and grown up with it, mu&s;t have much Time and Patience ere it can be totally &s;ubdued and eradicated from the Blood and Spi|rits. Though I have never &s;een any Di&s;|&s;ections of the human Body, yet I may gue&s;s from what I ob&s;erve without, that the Stomach, Bowels, and Inte&s;tines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are no le&s;s di&s;ordered within, which mu&s;t infallibly be the Source of many fa|tal Con&s;equences, unle&s;s removed by Art or Nature, as &s;ometimes may be the Ca&s;e. Every the lea&s;t Tube or Strainer in the whole human Frame may po&s;&s;ibly be tor|mented by the Seeds of this Di&s;order, as they begin to expand, and long before they arrive to a Bulk perceiveable by the Eye or Touch. Unu&s;ual Prickings and Da&s;hings, and Sickne&s;s at the Stomach, and Unea&s;ine&s;s in many Parts, are com|mon Complaints in the beginning of this Di&s;ea&s;e: What can the&s;e proceed from, but the A&s;&s;emblage of &s;harp, &s;aline, in|terfering Particles, endeavouring to force
<PB N="23" REF="27">their Way through the&s;e fine Strainers by Stops and Starts. The upper Lip &s;welled, Eyes inflamed, the Glands about the Jaws, Neck, Throat, and Shoulders, tumified, &s;how this Di&s;order rather &s;ooner (though not always) than mo&s;t other Parts. The Backs of the Hands, Elbows, Arm-Pits, Ribs and Ancles, are fre|quently affected, and as the Di&s;order en|crea&s;es, the &s;ofter Bones feel its Effects, which if they exfoliate, are often cured, if not, u&s;ually terminate in malignant Ulcers of a cancerous Nature, and bring the Patient at Length to an End.</P>
<P>THAT the King's Evil is a Di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>&s;ui Generis,</HI> or after its own Kind, I can readily admit. But then how often is it complicated and blended with others, as the Gout, Venereal Evil, White Swel|lings in the Knees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;eem to have a near Affinity with it, by affecting the Bones and Joints much in the &s;ame Manner? But the various Combinations and Degrees of each particular Malady that may at the &s;ame Time &s;eize on the human Sy&s;tem, I believe is impo&s;&s;ible to be di&s;tingui&s;hed and a&s;certained. Then how can we range the various Swellings common or extraordinary, that ari&s;e on the Surface of the Body, or lie almo&s;t concealed among the Mu&s;cles, and are at|tended with &s;uch novel Appearances every
<PB N="24" REF="28">Day, without knowing every particular Degree, of every particular Di&s;ea&s;e, and their Con&s;equences, that may po&s;&s;ibly be at once uniting in the &s;ame Body and its Members? What may probably be the immediate Cau&s;e of this Di&s;temper, I have already hinted at; but the more re|mote ones, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, are as numerous as the different Appearances of Tumours and Ulcers in all Parts of the Body put together. I &s;hould &s;oon wade out of my Depth, if I attempted to un|fold &s;uch intricate and perplexing Combi|nations, or the Forms and e&s;&s;ential Pro|perties of tho&s;e fine Particles of hidden Matter, as may contribute to the Forma|tion of the King's Evil, and have puzzled &s;o many judicious and learned Phy&s;icians, and may &s;till do &s;o for Ages to come.</P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to &s;ay &s;omething relative to the Cure of this ob&s;tinate Di&s;|ea&s;e. If we &s;earch the mo&s;t eminent Authors in pur&s;uit of a Cure for this Di&s;|temper, we &s;hall find our&s;elves mi&s;erably di&s;appointed, &s;ays a late Writer: I &s;ay &s;o too. Therefore as their Pre&s;criptions &s;el|dom an&s;wer the de&s;ired End, I &s;hall take no Notice of them, but pur&s;ue my own Way of Thinking. I have no great Opi|nion of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of Tumours (unle&s;s the Face is likely to be much deformed by them, e&s;pecially of the Female Sex; or
<PB N="25" REF="29">when the Eyes are inflamed, and very trouble&s;ome, then I think &s;uch a Remedy is ju&s;tifiable) becau&s;e the peccant Matter is only removed from one Part to another, and not cured, but &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the Blood and Spirits, and may po&s;&s;ibly be thrown on a more noble and dangerous Part, and do much more Harm than can be ea&s;ily imagined.</P>
<P>MY Patients have often told me (to u&s;e their own Way of Expre&s;&s;ion) that they have had Swellings in their Necks, or other Places, and Neighbour &s;uch a one told 'um, if they did them with Vinegar, 'twould put them away, which it &s;ometimes did, but in a little Time others aro&s;e in their Stead in other Parts, that would not yield to their old Remedy. If they were Pari&s;h Poor, and looked af|ter by the Year, they fell to my Share, becau&s;e nothing was to be got by them, and 'twould co&s;t a deal of Trouble and Expence for Phy&s;ick for &s;uch poor Wretches, who were better out of the Way. How unhappy are poor People, to be thus cruelly u&s;ed by &s;ome mercenary Phy&s;ick-Mongers? How many fune&s;t Ex|amples are in every one's Memory (if they would recollect a little) of &s;ome Neighbours, or Acquaintance, that have even de&s;troyed them&s;elves, by backing or &s;triking in Humours (as it is called)
<PB N="26" REF="30">and repelling them to &s;ome mortal Part? This Practice is too frequent with the Fair Sex; I hope they will think &s;eriou&s;ly for the future, and do &s;o no more. If any Rea&s;ons occur to make Repellents nece&s;|&s;ary, I then order proper Purgatives to carry off the morbifick Matter, clean&s;e the Blood, and prevent any Danger from &s;uch a Revul&s;ion. I&s;&s;ues or Setons I never u&s;e, and often dry them up, for I could never perceive any Benefit accrue to the Patient from them. If Ulcers di&s;charge the offending Matter lodged in or near them, why &s;hould we invite it another Way, and not follow the Road Nature has pointed out? What are Ulcers, but &s;o many natural I&s;&s;ues, which will di&s;|charge them&s;elves, if a good Dige&s;tion is procured, as long as any offending Mat|ter &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in or near them, and then dry up of cour&s;e, unle&s;s hindred by Art? Why then &s;hould we make an artificial Ulcer that Nature wants not? Nay, is even detrimental to it, by encrea&s;ing a Di&s;charge, which we are endeavouring to dimini&s;h, and wholly &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>SALT Water being much in Vogue, I &s;hall give my Thoughts on it as a Remedy for the King's Evil. I had a Patient troubled with a very painful Inflamma|tion of the Eyes, which had baffled the Skill of all &s;he had applied to in <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="31">(and being a Per&s;on of Fortune, be &s;ure no Advice was wanting) &s;he was &s;ent to the Sea Side to drink the Salt Water, which &s;he did for a Month, and returned much wor&s;e: When I &s;aw her, I &s;oon perceived the Di&s;order to be &s;crophulous; &s;he kept in a dark Room, not being able to abide the lea&s;t Gleam of Light, complained of intolerable da&s;hing Pains in her Forehead, and Eyes, which di&s;charged great Quan|tities of clear Water, &s;o &s;calding and cor|ro&s;ive, that it excoriated the Skin where it flowed down the Cheeks. This Lady's Complaints were afterwards removed by a mo&s;t &s;imple and ea&s;y Remedy, which I apply in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, and &s;eldom mi&s;s of a Cure. What I would ob&s;erve from this is, that the &s;aline Particles of the Water, which &s;he drank &s;o long, added more Matter of a &s;imilar Nature to what was too abundant in the Blood and Spirits al|ready, which entirely convinces me that drinking Salt Water is wrong in &s;crophu|lous Ca&s;es of the Eyes; and bathing for them, I believe, to be equally hurtful, for we know many &s;aline Particles may in bathing be ab&s;orbed through the Pores of the Skin by the Blood, and &s;o unite with tho&s;e already there. Ob&s;erve what Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="margQuotes">"As it &s;eemeth Salt draweth Blood, as well as Blood draw|eth Salt."</Q> That is, they reciprocally
<PB N="28" REF="32">attract each other. Extirpating of tumi|fied Glands (which is no unfrequent Prac|tice) I have never u&s;ed, either by the Knife, or Cautery, actual or potential; neither can I approve the Method, though I own its the mo&s;t painful. I have had &s;ome Patients with me, who&s;e Glands have been thus treated, and to all Appearance quite cured, and for a Time well; but as the Humour was not thereby eradicated out of the Blood and Spirits, it broke out again in fre&s;h Places, which brought them to me. The&s;e fre&s;h Complaints I have afterwards cured with ea&s;y and gentle Applications. Sometimes indeed, where the Di&s;order has been mild, and invaded but few Glands, and the Seeds of the Di&s;|ea&s;e wholly contained in them, Extirpa|tion has done the Deed. But if the&s;e tumified Glands can be reduced to their natural State by a le&s;s dangerous and painful Way (though indeed not &s;o quick|ly) and no Danger of any Tumours ari|&s;ing el&s;ewhere: Which &s;hall we choo&s;e, the more quick, painful, and uncertain, or the more &s;low, ea&s;y, and &s;ure Method of Cure? How many have been &s;alivated without receiving any Good? In&s;tances of this Kind I have met with in my Prac|tice, more than once. A learned Phy&s;i|cian writes, <Q REND="margQuotes">"A Salivation is found by
<PB N="29" REF="33">Experience incapable of eradicating this ob&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding it has &s;uch peculiar Specifick, and almo&s;t certain Virtue to remove the Venereal Evil.</Q> Which plainly proves (as I think) the Seeds or Cau&s;es of the two Di&s;tempers to be very different; and confutes the vulgar Notion, that the Ve|nereal Evil is the Parent of the King's Evil; for if they both &s;pring from the &s;ame Original, why are they not removed by the &s;ame Means? Which we find they are not; but when united in the &s;ame Subject, its rational to think they encrea&s;e each others Malignity, and render the Cure more uncertain and difficult.</P>
<P>MOST People afflicted with &s;crophu|lous Di&s;orders in their Eyes, are very fond of hood-winking or covering them from the Light and Air, which is the wor&s;t Method they can take, for it not only encrea&s;es the Inflammation, but in|vites the Humour that Way, and con&s;e|quently occa&s;ions a greater Di&s;charge from them, which &s;hould be carried off ano|ther Way, and which is often of &s;o cor|ro&s;ive a Nature, as to excoriate and fret the Skin of the Face, as it di&s;tils down the Cheeks: I always make them throw away their Coverings, either going to Bed, or ri&s;ing in the Morning, to prevent tak|ing Cold, by too &s;uddenly expo&s;ing their
<PB N="30" REF="34">Eyes; and my Succe&s;s has always war|ranted this Practice. After di&s;approving others Proceedings in the Cure of this Di&s;order, it may be a&s;ked, why I don't publi&s;h my own, which I think &s;o much better? To &s;uch Enquirers I an&s;wer: The Medicines I u&s;e are very innocent and common Things, but the Prepara|tion is curious and difficult, and takes much Time to compleat. Should I di|vulge it, very few People (except the Compounders of Medicine) would attend the Proce&s;s, or take the Trouble of it; and how little Good will a vitiou&s;ly pre|pared Medicine do, is obvious to any one: And as the common Labourers, and Han|dicraft&s;men, their Wives and Children, make the Bulk of my Patients, it is above their Capacity, and of no U&s;e to tell them any Thing about it, more than what is nece&s;&s;ary to their right managing them&s;elves under the Regimen I direct, and to give them the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t Directions po&s;&s;ible, as well as to u&s;e the ea&s;ie&s;t Means for their Recovery. As to the Sellers of Medicines, I think they can have no claim to reap any Advantage from my Labour and Experience. The better Sort of Families infected by this Di&s;ea&s;e are really more to be pitied, than the very lowe&s;t Cla&s;s of the People, for they are but too often amu&s;ed with falla|cious
<PB N="31" REF="35">and flattering Accounts of their own real Di&s;orders (of this in particular, and as Dr. <HI>Radcliff</HI> truly ob&s;erved) kept in Mi&s;ery for their Money. And to every one in general I &s;ay, nobody has any Cau&s;e to complain of keeping the Thing to my&s;elf, for every one that plea&s;es, and has the King's Evil, may apply to me, and reap the &s;ame Benefit, as well as if they knew the whole Proce&s;s. (Great I know) is the general Clamour again&s;t Se|crets, No&s;trums, and old Wives Medi|cines, as &s;ome plea&s;e to call them; but I would fain know, if any prudent Per&s;on would refu&s;e to be cured by a &s;afe and in|nocent Medicine, unle&s;s he knew the whole particular Preparation and Compo|&s;ition; or becau&s;e I don't choo&s;e to make that Di&s;covery of my Methods that pub|lick Curio&s;ity or Cen&s;ure may expect? Did Dr. <HI>James</HI> publi&s;h the Preparation of his Fever Powder, yet I believe few Peo|ple in their Sen&s;es would &s;cruple the U&s;e of it? If the candid, humane, and ge|nerous Phy&s;icians an Surgeons &s;mile on my Endeavours for the Publick Good, let the envious, &s;narling, and covetous Prac|titioners blame me if they plea&s;e, for not treating my Patients <HI>Secundum Artem</HI> (as they term it) that is, by not making long Bills.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="36">
<P>I SHALL mention but one Thing more: Many People who have &s;een the amazing Effects of my Applications, often tell me, they hope I will not let the Secret, and its Improvements, die with me; I do not intend it &s;hall; for I carefully write down every Patient's Complaints, the Methods I u&s;e, and the Succe&s;s that follows, as far as I can be informed by them&s;elves or Neighbours, who come to me on their Recommendation, by which Means I frequently hear of People I have cured, who living at a Di&s;tance, and being free from their Complaints, take no further Notice of me; though all I de&s;ire for my Trouble is, to hear from them&s;elves, either by Letter, or Word of Mouth, when they are well: But all my Patients are not &s;o forgetful of their Benefactor. My Papers and Ob&s;ervations relating to the Cure of the King's Evil, I hope will fall into the Hands of my Executor: And may he u&s;e them to the Benefit of Man|kind in general, an the Poor in particu|lar, with the &s;ame Succe&s;s, and charitable Intentions, as I have done.</P>

<P>SUSANNA SPOWERS, Wife of Martin Spowers, Mariner, aged 26, lately living at Mr. Vines's near Sir William Warron's Square in Wapping, London, had a large Tumor, very hard and livid, on the lower Part of the left Brea&s;t next the Arm, which had been extirpated by Mr. Caywood, Surgeon and Apothecary, near by, judged to be a Cancer; but as he did not cure it, about a Month after, &s;he came to me. Then the whole Brea&s;t was inflamed, with two more Tumors ri&s;ing on the lower Part, and &s;ome &s;mall Scropholous Complaints running about. The&s;e Tumors afterwards broke, and di&s;|charged Matter as the other, which are all now well; and one other large Tu|mor, about the Middle of the Brea&s;t, I di&s;per&s;ed without breaking. The whole Brea&s;t is now quite firm and well, &s;mooth, &s;oft, and of its natural Colour and Size, as before, except the Sear, which &s;till remains as a Proof the Sur|geon had been there. Whil&s;t in the

Note; Many &s;cro|phulated Brea&s;ts are mi&s;taken for Can|cers, and have been treated as &s;uch, to the irreparable Damage of the poor Suf|ferers.</P>

Then I was applied to, and healed them up, but &s;oon after neglecting my Direc|tions, the Humor fell into both Eyes; then I was again applied to, and remov|ed that Di&s;order; and &s;he is now free from any Scrophulous Complaints what|ever.</P>

<P>Mrs. Brown was a fat lu&s;ty Woman: About a Year ago had a large Tumor ro&s;e in her right Brea&s;t, and gathered in nine &s;everal Places, and opened by a Sur|geon, and di&s;charged much, but that be|ing though in&s;ufficient to le&s;&s;en the Brea&s;t, two Setons were made quite thro' the Brea&s;t, (which was very large) clo&s;e to the Ribs, in the Form of a Cro&s;s, and as the Silk rotted out, in ten or twelve Days, more Silk was put in, and &s;he had &s;even or eight Ulcers in other Parts of the Brea&s;t. Several Surgeons met, to take off the Brea&s;t, and told her if it was not taken off &s;he could not live to Michaelmas Day following; that her Brea&s;t would rot off in a Week or two, if not cut off. This was the State of the Brea&s;t when I under|took it. November the 30th following, I &s;aw this Woman; all the Ulcers well healed, and the Brea&s;t firm, and the Wo|man in good Health a Spirits, without any Complaints whatever. Feb. 27, 1762,
<PB N="58" REF="62">&s;he was with me again, and &s;how'd me her right Brea&s;t &s;ound and firm, but told me that about three Weeks before, on taking Cold, &s;he felt a da&s;hing Pain in her left Brea&s;t, which &s;he &s;hewed me. There was a &s;mooth &s;oft Tumor ri&s;ing on the upper Part, above the Nipple, which had encrea&s;ed fa&s;t, with &s;ome da&s;hing Pains. I ordered her proper Remedies for this new Complaint. April the 4th, her Hu&s;band came to tell me the Tumor was broke, and di&s;charged in &s;eve|ral Places round the Nipple. I ordered ac|cordingly, and Sept. the 6th, 1762, her Hu&s;band came again and told me her Brea&s;t had been quite well 2 Months pa&s;t, and his Wife in good Health a Spirits, no Complaint at all, and that the Day be|fore he came &s;he was brought to-bed of a fine Girl, and both like to do very well.
