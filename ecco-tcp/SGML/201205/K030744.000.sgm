<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<Q>AUDI ALTERAM PARTEM.</Q>
<P>IT is now well known with what little truth hemlock was recommended as a cure for cancers, Dr. De Haen of Vienna, phy&s;ician in the &s;ame ho&s;pital with Dr. Storck, having given us a fair account of this matter.</P>
<P>In a letter to a phy&s;ician in England, publi&s;hed in the third volume of the Medical Mu&s;eum, he &s;ays, &s;peaking of the Cicuta, <Q><P>"I am now able to ex|plain this matter to you, from the many experiments I have made in
<PB N="ii" REF="5">con&s;equence of an order received from high authority. The fir&s;t thirty pa|tients it ab&s;olutely failed me, but confiding in the good faith of others, that they might happen to be &s;uch only as were incurable, I advanced to make further trials, as well publicly in the ho&s;pital, as privately in the city and &s;uburbs, to the num|ber of one hundred and twenty; but, unhappily for me, after &s;o much trouble, the re&s;ult was, that not one per&s;on was cured or relieved by it; that many grew wor&s;e, and that &s;even unhappy women with cancers in their brea&s;ts peri&s;hed un|der my hands, of whom I could have &s;aved &s;ome of them by the knife, and in all probability others might have been pre&s;erved a long time by the palliative methods."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t own, &s;ir, I am a&s;hamed of this affair. How did I intreat
<PB N="iii" REF="6">tho&s;e to whom it belonged to u&s;e more precaution, and at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;|pend for &s;ome time the printing of tho&s;e books that prai&s;e the Cicuta, till repeated trials had been made, and by &s;everal hands, le&s;t the pub|lic faith &s;hould be abu&s;ed by a premature publication, and the au|thor rendered ridiculous in the face of the univer&s;e. But my re|mon&s;trances were fruitle&s;s; and, to my great concern, my be&s;t friends abruptly fell out with me, and I have incurred the di&s;grace of the be&s;t of &s;overeigns."</P></Q> Wherefore, three years after, in 1766, he pub|li&s;hed his <HI>Epi&s;tola de Cicuta,</HI> wherein he denies the cures which Dr. Storck &s;aid he had accompli&s;hed by this remedy, and maintains it, <Q>"that many, or mo&s;t of tho&s;e very pa|tients Dr. Storck a&s;&s;erts to have been perfectly cured, died while they were taking this medicine;
<PB N="iv" REF="7">and that there was proved in reality, on a candid enquiry, no more than one that could be &s;aid to be cured by hemlock; that al|though five hundred pounds weight of Dr. Storck's extract of Cicuta had been &s;ent to different places abroad, yet there has not been received one authentic account of a real cure of a true cancer having been ever yet performed by it in any in&s;tance where it was u&s;ed."</Q> Which per|fectly agrees with general experience; and indeed it is amazing, that it &s;hould ever have been received as a &s;pecific in this di&s;order, when we reflect, that upon enquiry, by di&s;&s;ec|tion, into the nature of a confirmed &s;chirrhus, the ve&s;&s;els ate found to be perfectly de&s;troyed and obliterated, and the whole to be one confu&s;ed ma&s;s; wherefore, any medicine cap|able of re&s;toring a part thus di&s;ea&s;ed, mu&s;t have a power of creating a new
<PB N="v" REF="8">&s;et of ve&s;&s;els, and of making a new gland of the old one; and we may as well believe that it has a power of re|moving any inconvenience from am|putation, by creating a new limb, as that it cured a true &s;chirrhus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who will take the trouble of examining &s;chirri with a good micro&s;cope, will look with in|dignation upon the accounts he meets with in Dr. Storck's books, and will be convinced, that unle&s;s we can di&s;cover a medicine that will penetrate into, correct the cancerous virus, and di&s;&s;olve all the di&s;|ea&s;ed parts into matter, we mu&s;t &s;till continue to remove cancers in time by the knife, or what is more tedious and painful, the cau&s;tic, if we think of curing the patient.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But when we reflect how de&s;ti|tute we were of any medicine cap|able of curing a cancer, we &s;hall &s;ee the rea&s;on why phy&s;icians and &s;ur|geons &s;hould &s;eek with avidity after a medicine recommended for this purpo&s;e by a phy&s;ician of eminence
<PB N="vi" REF="9">and character; and finding it give ea&s;e in &s;ome in&s;tances, its u&s;e has been continued, not con&s;idering that it is an opiate, and that the &s;ame ad|vantage might have been received from &s;mall do&s;es of opium; and that both opium and hemlock lull the pa|tient into a fatal &s;ecurity, while the nece&s;&s;ary and proper methods are ne|glected, and the di&s;ea&s;e makes an in|curable progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the writer of the E&s;&s;ay on the Kinkcough is a true di&s;ciple of Dr. Storck; and if this publication is well received, we have rea&s;on given to expect a more exten&s;ive account of the virtues of hemlock; wherefore it mu&s;t be a thankful office to en|quire, how far what is already &s;aid by this writer merits attention, and whether, as he a&s;&s;erts, <Q>"it is a &s;pe|cific in the kinkcough, according to the mo&s;t proper interpretation of
<PB N="vii" REF="10">that word,"</Q> to prevent our being again ha&s;tily led, in giving preference to a medicine, perhaps no ways en|titled to the encomiums be&s;towed on it.</P>
<P>Although by &s;hewing that the ca&s;es Dr, B&mdash; has given are in&s;uffici|ent to recommend hemlock, and that he him&s;elf does not believe what he has &s;aid in favour of this medicine to be true, we might an&s;wer all the ends propo&s;ed; yet, as theory is apt to affect practice, it will be proper to examine his doctrine previous to his ca&s;es, and more e&s;pecially as it will &s;hew this imitator of THESSALUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader who is not acquainted with medical hi&s;tory, mu&s;t be informed, that THESSALUS lived in the time of NERO, and with madne&s;s railed in open invectives again&s;t all phy&s;icians. He even had the vanity to direct, that the word IATRONICES &s;hould be written upon his tomb-&s;tone, in hopes of having it be|lieved, that he was &s;uperior in his profe&s;&s;ion to any phy&s;ician that ever lived.

<HEAD>ANIMADVERSIONS ON A LATE TREATISE on the KINKCOUGH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To Dr. B*****.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read your Treati&s;e on the Kink|cough, and willingly point out to you &s;ome over&s;ights in this work, in hopes of improving your medical knowledge, and thereby enabling you better to &s;upport the character you have &s;o long a&s;&s;umed, of being "&s;econd in the profe&s;&s;ion to no man."</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ir, your &s;tricture upon DOCTOR FO|THERGILL, in the beginning of your Preface, &s;eems not only to be unnece&s;&s;ary, but a little unlucky to your&s;elf; becau&s;e, I dare &s;ay, you might have gone on in your &s;y&s;tem-building quietly, and with|out notice; whereas, from what you have there &s;aid, people will naturally be led to make a com|pari&s;on between the two writers that cannot po&s;&s;ibly turn out to your advantage.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="13">
<P>They will at once plainly &s;ee that you have ob|&s;cured and perplexed your &s;ubject, by treading in the path he has avoided. Tho&s;e conver&s;ant with medical books will di&s;cover, that you have &s;erved your HEMLOCK up in a ha&s;h of old materials; and that you have not advanced one new ob&s;ervation, or even one new thought, except &s;ome new errors, which it was quite unnece&s;&s;ary to add to the theory and practice of phy&s;ic. Be&s;ides, I apprehend, your book will be thought to border a little upon quackery; while it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the DOCTOR has written like a man of &s;cience.</P>
<P>Whoever looks over the 30th article, in the third volume of the Medical Ob&s;ervations and In|quiries, will find that he recommends, from the &s;ucce&s;s of him&s;elf and many of his medical ac|quaintance, a powder compo&s;ed of crabs claws and emetic tartar, as a very u&s;eful medicine in the ta&s;&s;is convul&s;iva, and in preference of oxymel of &s;quills and ipecacuanha, which have &s;o often afforded mo&s;t relief, by emptying the &s;tomach of its contents; and he has mentioned the manner of giving it, and the diet he has found mo&s;t u&s;eful on this occa&s;ion. And, &s;urely, there can be no impropriety in his confirming, by the experience of him&s;elf and many phy&s;icians, the u&s;efulne&s;s of a medicine which has been advi&s;ed by preceding writers. And why is his giving directions about the manner of its being taken, and laying down rules for diet, unworthy of him, when &s;o great a man as your&s;elf has imitated him in the&s;e particulars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Kinkcough, p. 169.</NOTE>?</P>
<PB N="3" REF="14">
<P>But he &s;ays, the remedy he recommends is not a certain cure in all ca&s;es; he would not be under&s;tood to &s;uppo&s;e, that it will alone complete the cure of the whooping-cough; &s;ays he, <Q>"I know it will not; and that this, as well as any other medicine, is u&s;eful or otherwi&s;e, ju&s;t as it is in|dicated:"</Q> whereas you happen not to trouble your head about indications, but recommend hem|lock <HI>as a &s;pecific</HI> in the di&s;order under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>A &s;pecific in the whooping-cough is a de&s;ireable remedy, if it could be obtained; but whether that you have advi&s;ed is better than the <HI>fle&s;h of fryed mice,</HI> which has been in vogue as a &s;pecific for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; may be much doubted; for &s;uch is the difference of con&s;titutions, the variations in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, and in the combinations of di&s;ea&s;es; that no one remedy has hitherto been found out, capable of invariably curing any one di&s;order. Quacks, therefore, only talk of curing di&s;ea&s;es under various circum&s;tances by a &s;pecific: they, indeed, from a poverty of knowledge, recommend one remedy in all &s;orts of complaints, and bring te&s;timony of their u&s;e from every recovery which happens where they are given. You, in like man|ner, have, for &s;everal years, been pre&s;cribing hem|lock in almo&s;t all the ca&s;es which have come be|fore you, and now a&s;cribe effects to it of which there is no evidence. I will point out an in&s;tance, which may &s;erve for the pre&s;ent. You &s;ay, it may be given in the &s;mall-pox <HI>with advantage,</HI> becau&s;e it was taken by an healthy boy and girl, in the be|ginning of the eruptive fever of this di&s;ea&s;e, after emptying their bowels by &s;enna tea, and the &s;mall-pox
<PB N="4" REF="15">turned out a very di&s;tinct good &s;ort. Now, if there had never before been a very di&s;tinct good &s;ort of &s;mall-pox, in an healthy boy and girl, e&s;pe|cially after purging, the hemlock might have gain|ed &s;ome credit; but if, upon enquiry, it &s;hould be di&s;covered, that a di&s;tinct good &s;ort of &s;mall-pox is not unfrequent where hemlock is not given, I rather think, no other conclu&s;ion can be drawn from the&s;e in&s;tances than that, like a chip in pottage, it nei|ther did good nor harm.</P>
<P>Nor can Dr. STORCK &s;helter you, I am fearful, from the appearance of having made a random ex|periment, if even what he &s;ays be true; for, &s;up|po&s;ing <HI>hemlock,</HI> in &s;ome in&s;tances, to have promoted a kindly &s;uppuration where the Peruvian bark failed; yet it does not follow, that it will promote a kindly &s;uppuration in the &s;mall-pox; becau&s;e different kinds of acrid matter require different correctives: though we no way accu&s;e you of making a random experiment by de&s;ign, but inno|cently, without knowing that matter in &s;ores and the matter in the &s;mall-pox may require different remedies.</P>
<P>However, though you have been a little out in the&s;e things, yet your declaration of not being an|&s;werable for other peoples experiments with hem|lock, unle&s;s made with the very preparation you always u&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No one will doubt, though Dr. B&mdash; has publi&s;hed his methods of preparing hemlock, that he means, by this caveat, the preparation made by his own apothecary, when they know that he is provided with a &s;ufficient quantity to &s;erve the whole kingdom.</NOTE>, may &s;creen you from reproach where
<PB N="5" REF="16">you are not known, in ca&s;e it is not found &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful in curing the kinkcough as you have repre|&s;ented it to be; for, in ju&s;tification of your&s;elf, you may have recour&s;e to your old practice, and &s;ay, that the blockhead of a compounder &s;corched the herb in drying, that he &s;tirred the juice with a wooden &s;kewer in&s;tead of a bit of hemlock &s;talk, or that there was certainly an ebullition while it was over the fire; which, if you are as &s;ucce&s;sful as you have been with no better arguments, may ef|fectually &s;top any clamour. And who can &s;ay, though they took the utmo&s;t care, that two or three bubbles did not ari&s;e? which would be &s;ufficient for your purpo&s;e; or you may further in&s;i&s;t upon it, that no one can &s;o exactly perform the method you have de&s;cribed, of making experiments upon people that are ill, as your&s;elf. Nor will the pre|&s;criptions being written in Engli&s;h, hinder your forcing a trade and carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s, as they will be under&s;tood by every good woman, who will not have any thing to do, but, as they have already experienced, to con&s;ult you, pay their fee, and re|ceive, with directions, in a pot &s;ealed up, your <Q>"<HI>agreeable, certain, and expeditious cure for the kinkcough.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>ARNAUD wrote a book, to prove that GOULARD'S extract of lead is the be&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al topic in &s;urgery, and may very properly be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of all others pre&s;cribed; that it could only be made by GOULARD him&s;elf; and that he, ARNAUD, was the only per&s;on in England intru&s;ted with the &s;ale of this preparation; in hopes, no doubt, of getting the whole trade in chirurgical
<PB N="6" REF="17">applications to him&s;elf. You, in imitation, have written a book, to prove that hemlock is a remedy again&s;t almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es; that it may properly be &s;ub&s;tituted for all others generally pre&s;cribed for the kinkcough; and that they mu&s;t have the very preparation you u&s;e.</P>
<P>An anonymous writer lately attempted to ex|plode, by chemical inve&s;tigation, all the febrifuge powders hitherto invented, in hopes of recom|mending the &s;ale of his own medicine for the cure of fevers. You have endeavoured to decry, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, the practice recommended by other phy&s;icians, and as much as lay in your power, by patching together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hreds from different authors, have dre&s;&s;ed out your performance with a &s;cientifical air, in hopes, no doubt, of &s;eeing your doctrine and medicines more greedily &s;wallowed. And if, by the&s;e means, you can per&s;uade the pub|lic to believe, that whatever has been written upon the &s;ubject is erroneous, you may, perhaps, drive a great trade, and we &s;hall then, without doubt, have the whole of your experience of hemlock as a medicine. Neverthele&s;s, we will now &s;ee whether your book and li&s;t of cures will &s;tand the te&s;t of inquiry; and the following are the heads of the chapters in which we &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s this matter.</P>

<P>The different names by which a di&s;ea&s;e is di&s;|tingui&s;hed being placed in one view is undoubtedly u&s;eful; but your <HI>&s;ynonymes,</HI> &s;ir, would have been much more perfect, if you had looked back to an earlier period, and informed us by what name the Greeks and Arabians di&s;tingui&s;hed what the Eng|li&s;h call the Whooping-cough; for both HIPPO|CRATES and AVICENNA gave it a name.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the &s;eat of the kinkcough.</HEAD>
<P>Though you a&s;&s;ert that arguments are fal|lacious, yet you are &s;o de&s;titute of plain proof, that you have not produced one fact in &s;upport
<PB N="11" REF="22">of your opinion, that the inte&s;tinal canal is the primary &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>That particular di&s;ea&s;es affect particular parts, is known to every one; but you will find it a dif|ficult matter to prove, <Q>"the mea&s;les <HI>chiefly</HI> affect the membrane inve&s;ting the lungs, the &s;mall-pox that of the &s;tomach, and agues that of the duodenum."</Q>&mdash;That the inte&s;tines of children are more irritable than the other parts of the body, will be equally difficult to prove. Dentition ren|ders all the nerves in the body praeternaturally irritable; and the colic-pains, and the like, do not &s;eem to ari&s;e from the nerves of the inte&s;tines being more irritable, but from their being more irritated, by an acid fir&s;t generated in the &s;tomach. Nor has Dr. Harris <HI>proved,</HI> that almo&s;t all the di&s;ea&s;es of children depend on an affection of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages; or who would believe that the CROUP for in&s;tance, had its &s;eat in the inte&s;tines, becau&s;e <HI>he</HI> &s;aid the complaints of infants &s;pring from an acid, their common &s;ource; and though it be allowed that a di&s;ea&s;e in the inte&s;tines can af|fect the whole, or any part of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and that worms lodging in the inte&s;tines can pro|duce a cough, yet it does not follow, that all coughs happening to children have their primary &s;eat in the &s;ame place: we could inconte&s;tably prove, that a violent cough took its ri&s;e from an inflammatory tumour in the hand; but, are we therefore to conclude, that the kinkcough ever had its primary &s;eat in this member of the body?</P>
<PB N="12" REF="23">
<P>Vomits being more &s;erviceable, when they render the body &s;oluble, only &s;eems to prove, that the di&s;ea&s;e is not confined to the &s;tomach; and if it be true, that &s;uch patients bear the action of vomits better than purges, the only conclu&s;ion that can be drawn is, that purges weaken by making a general drain from the whole body, where|as vomits do not cau&s;e &s;o great an evacua|tion.</P>
<P>Nor is the king's evil, and rickets, being the con&s;equence of <HI>an ob&s;tinate</HI> kinkcough, any more to your purpo&s;e. You acknowledge the king's-evil to have its &s;eat in the conglobate glands; and &s;uppo&s;ing, (though it is far from being certain) that tho&s;e of the me&s;entery are fir&s;t affected, yet this is no clear proof in your favour, this di&s;ea&s;e being in another bowel. And can the kink|cough <HI>&s;imply con&s;idered,</HI> any more produce the king's-evil, than the king's-evil the kinkcough? The rickets have followed the &s;mall-pox, which you &s;ay is a di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;tomach; and any di&s;|order at a certain period in life, that greatly weakens and relaxes the fibres of children, pre|di&s;po&s;ed to the rickets, will bring them on. You confe&s;s, that both the&s;e di&s;orders are in con|&s;equence of the kinkcough's continuing a long time, and to the inte&s;tines thereby lo&s;ing their contractile power. And we al&s;o think, as the&s;e di&s;orders never follow the kinkcough, till it has long continued, that they are brought on by its ob&s;tinacy cau&s;ing a general weakne&s;s and relaxa|tion, in habits previou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to the&s;e com|plaints,
<PB N="13" REF="24">and not to its primary &s;eat being in the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>But &s;urely you are much mi&s;taken about your fourth, and what you think your mo&s;t powerful argument, p. 25. For if we are to conclude from the periodical returns, that the kinkcough and in|termitting fevers have both their &s;eat in the &s;ame place, you prove that in&s;tead of the inte&s;tines, the kinkcough may have its primary &s;eat in the eyes, or in one of the teeth, becau&s;e you have given us a clear in&s;tance of an intermittent thus &s;ituated; for the black &s;tools we imagine were owing to their being tinctured with extract of bark; and we &s;hould have received equal information about the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, if we had been told that the patient had black &s;tools after eating bilberries. If you did not think the &s;eat of this intermittent to be in the tooth, why did you direct it to be drawn? and are not local intermittents common? We believe that intermitting fevers have often their &s;eat in the abdomen, yet we think the opi|nion of their proximate cau&s;e being in the liver, me&s;entery, &amp;c. more probable than that it lodges &s;olely in the guts; nor do your two ca&s;es prove the contrary. You have before &s;aid, p. 23. that an enlarged belly and colic are the &s;ymptoms of ob&s;tructed glands in the me&s;entery; and might not the pain in the fir&s;t boy's belly, p. 26. ari&s;e from a &s;imilar cau&s;e, and the cure chiefly to be owing to the fomentation removing the ob&s;truc|tion, becau&s;e his colic was cured before the worms were entirely eradicated? Might not the cure of
<PB N="14" REF="25">the &s;econd boy be accompli&s;hed by the purges producing the &s;ame effect; and would the belly have been large <HI>and hard,</HI> if the inte&s;tines only had been di&s;ea&s;ed?</P>
<P>In regard to the inte&s;tines being the mo&s;t likely place for generating an infectious di&s;ea&s;e, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that however plau&s;ible the arguments in favour of this opinion may appear, they are very far from being conclu&s;ive; and though the dy&s;en|tery and putrid fever, &amp;c. &s;pread by contagion, yet it is not a clear point, that the mia&s;mata bring on the &s;ucceeding di&s;ea&s;e by fir&s;t affecting the ali|mentary canal. The viperine poi&s;on, though deadly when infu&s;ed into a wound, taken by the mouth produces no bad effect; nor will the va|riolous matter create a di&s;ea&s;e &s;wallowed in the &s;ame manner, provided in its pa&s;&s;age it touches not an excoriated part, though even a &s;ingle atom is fully &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e when the cuticle is removed, and it comes in contact with the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, &s;eated on the &s;urface of the body. A poor lad had a large tumour in his mouth, ari&s;|ing from the upper jaw, which was very foul, and from which a large quantity of very offen&s;ive pu|trid matter was &s;wallowed in the night-time, when he was a&s;leep. It purged him gently, and, at the end of three weeks or a month, his blood &s;eemed to be di&s;&s;olved by the vibices which appeared in the &s;kin; yet he never had the lea&s;t fever, though he lived at lea&s;t &s;ix or eight weeks, and at la&s;t died of extreme weakne&s;s; whereas, had the &s;ame quan|tity of matter been ab&s;orbed from an ulcer, a col|liquative
<PB N="15" REF="26">fever would &s;oon have been the con&s;e|quence. From all which we would infer, that the juices in the primae viae correct and reader le&s;s active infectious matter; and that this does not &s;eem to be the only way by which infection is com|municated. The opinion that the mia&s;ms which propagate infection, enter the habit by the lym|phatics in the lungs, and other ab&s;orbents, &s;eems more likely to be true; for in this way, by &s;uch time as the di&s;ea&s;e makes its appearance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When we inoculate for the &s;mall-pox, it is evident that the variolous matter enters the inte&s;tines before any fever comes on, by its de&s;troying worms.

<P>But to return to the re&s;emblance betwixt the kinkcough and intermitting fevers, which &s;eem to ari&s;e from an accumulation and di&s;charge of phlegm; for when the &s;tomach is unloaded by coughing and vomiting, the patient becomes ea&s;y till a fre&s;h quantity of phlegm is collected in the &s;tomach &s;ufficient to excite another fit of cough|ing; which, &s;urely, notwith&s;tanding your argu|ments to the contrary, is a full proof, that this bowel is immediately affected, and that unloading it is the cau&s;e of the intermi&s;&s;ion. You indeed think differently; but may we not &s;uppo&s;e, that in intermitting fevers ob&s;cure intermi&s;&s;ions are rendered di&s;tinct, by tho&s;e medicines which remove the offending cau&s;e from the affected part? And
<PB N="16" REF="27">why then are we not to believe a di&s;order, that has periodical returns, to be &s;eated in the &s;tomach, becau&s;e vomiting affords relief?&mdash;Why truly, &s;ay you, <Q>"It would &s;eem that the interfering cau&s;e, a foulne&s;s of &s;tomach, being thus removed, the pure inte&s;tinal &s;ymptom of intermi&s;&s;ion becomes evident and di&s;tinct:"</Q> which is a mo&s;t futile argument, becau&s;e you have not in one in&s;tance proved, that intermittents are &s;eated in the in|te&s;tines; and we may therefore conclude, that WALDSCHMID, when he &s;aid this cough proceed|ed from the &s;tomach, was guided by common|&s;en&s;e, which you, &s;ir, have de&s;erted; and through the whole of this chapter have had recour&s;e to mere conjecture and hypothe&s;is.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the cau&s;es of the kinkcough.</HEAD>
<P>How full and true your de&s;cription of the kink|cough is, we have already ob&s;erved, and &s;hall farther make appear; and how far your ob&s;erva|tions have e&s;tabli&s;hed the true &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, let every man judge. However, you have given us a clear in&s;tance, that you remember what you learnt at lecture, in &s;o very learnedly explaining what is the predi&s;po&s;ing, and what the proximate cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e; and to be &s;ure it required a ma&s;terly hand to point out that a di&s;ea&s;e is pre&s;ent, while its cau&s;e is pre&s;ent: but we do in&s;i&s;t upon it, that a di&s;ea&s;e often remains after its proximate cau&s;e is removed. But wonderful information
<PB N="17" REF="28">mu&s;t accrue to the public from their now being &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e of being acquainted with the cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e; we may add, when it can be accomplished; <Q>"but &s;o great are the difficulties of tracing out the hidden cau&s;es of the evils to which this frame of ours is &s;ubject, that the mo&s;t candid of the profe&s;&s;ion have ever allow|ed and lamented how unavoidably they are in the dark;"</Q> and the abortivene&s;s of your at|tempt in this re&s;pect, is one clear proof how ju&s;tly they have rea&s;oned.</P>
<P>Few or none will think with you in regard to the kinkcough being peculiar to childhood, be|cau&s;e it &s;ometimes &s;eizes grown people; and it may with truth be affirmed, that the &s;tory about the irritability of children, both in health and when di&s;ea&s;ed, has been long known and applied; and certain it is, that this di&s;order more commonly affects children, without being preceded by any other di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, <Q>"an enumeration of the effects of the &s;pecific mia&s;ms, which produce the kink|cough, will &s;ufficiently point out their true na|ture;"</Q> but not &s;uch a perplexed enumeration as you have given us. In one place you a&s;&s;ert, p. 51. that they act upon the nervous powers, and increa&s;e the irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, a few lines after, <Q>"that as far as your &s;en&s;es can di&s;|cover, they act chiefly on the mucus;"</Q> and then again, a few lines below, you &s;ay, <Q>"it ap|pears that the kinkcough an&s;wers to the defini|tion of pe&s;tilential di&s;orders, &amp;c. &s;ince its
<PB N="18" REF="29">mia&s;ms are contagious, and act chiefly on the nerves;"</Q> and la&s;tly, after this confu&s;ed ac|count, <Q>"you hope you have &s;ufficiently cleared up the nature of the contagious particles."</Q> But in what manner? For do not mia&s;ms, as different in their <HI>nature</HI> as po&s;&s;ible, act upon the nervous power, and increa&s;e the irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, of which the mia&s;ms producing the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, &amp;c. are an in&s;tance? or why do they produce different di&s;ea&s;es? Suppo&s;e what you have &s;aid to be true, it only proves that they have an irritating property, which is far from explor|ing their <HI>nature:</HI> but all the&s;e little mi&s;takes every con&s;iderate man will excu&s;e, when he reflects that you do not pretend to go deeper into this matter than the limits of your under&s;tanding will permit.</P>
<P>But to have been con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elf, you &s;hould have omitted enquiring into the origin of the contagious particles which give ri&s;e to the kinkcough, as this is certainly wading out of your depth. Indeed in this inquiry you &s;et out very aukwardly; for not having examined into the mat|ter your&s;elf, you are led into a mi&s;take by copy|ing a former writer, in regard to our not having any very early account about this di&s;order; for Hippocrates pre&s;cribed <HI>ad ta&s;&s;im pueri</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> nota finem lib. Morb.

Fien. Dort. 1. p. 157. vol. i.</NOTE>.
<PB N="19" REF="30">No conclu&s;ion, therefore, can be drawn as to the place of the growth of the&s;e particles, except it be true that they are bred in people's guts; and they then may be natives of Europe, and every other quarter of the globe. Even when they revi&s;ited Bar|badoes. According to your account they mu&s;t e&s;cape from the guts, and we may readily &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome pa&s;&s;enger carried a belly-full over, and letting fly as &s;oon as he landed, infected the whole i&s;land. Indeed Dr. Hillary ob&s;erves, that the hooping-cough appeared in Barbadoes in the month of July 1753, after a good deal of rain, often with thunder and lightning, though the in|termediate days were hot and dry; and he could not find upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, that any child or elder per&s;on brought it thither, which you may conclude is in favour of your doctrine; but you mu&s;t be told, that fermentation de&s;troys the co|he&s;ion of all bodies upon which it acts. That tough vi&s;cid phlegm is always di&s;charged in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the kinkcough; that there is, there|fore, no fermentation in the ca&s;e, and that the whole of what you have &s;aid about creating dele|terious particles in the guts is of cour&s;e chimeri|cal, and &s;eems to be no better &s;upported than the opinion that Spani&s;h mares become pregnant by a&s;cending high mountains, and &s;wallowing with open mouth the we&s;tern wind.</P>
<P>If &s;o, the remainder of what you have &s;aid in this chapter, except its being &s;ometimes propa|gated by contagion, falls to the ground, and re|quires no farther comment; though, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
<PB N="20" REF="31">I much admire your arguments again&s;t the removal of children in this di&s;order; becau&s;e, if they were removed from Derby, and its environs, the writing of your book might not an&s;wer the end de&s;igned; and yet it may be difficult to di&s;|prove the truth of the opinion, that pure air a&s;&s;i&s;ts in recovering the patient. For, if <Q>"the air under certain circum&s;tances is the primary cau&s;e of this di&s;order,"</Q> how comes it to pa&s;s that the kinkcough does not depend upon the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, like many epidemic di&s;ea&s;es? Will not an air capable of producing the kinkcough be a con&s;tant <HI>fomes morbi?</HI> and, con&s;equently, remov|ing the patient to a place where the air is pure mu&s;t be rational at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>And, though you have not only <HI>a priori,</HI> but likewi&s;e <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> come to the &s;ame determina|tion, yet I que&s;tion whether you have &s;atisfactori|ly cleared up this matter; for the mucous glands of the &s;tomach, and tho&s;e of the inte&s;tines, are both of the &s;ame kind; and will it be believed that the air <HI>under certain circum&s;tances,</HI> when taken in by the mouth, can pa&s;s through the &s;tomach without affecting it; and is not the &s;tomach load|ed with phlegm from the beginning?

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the hi&s;tory of hemlock, as a cure for the kinkcough.</HEAD>
<P>What you &s;ay, &s;ir, has been a&s;&s;erted about the cure of the kinkcough, may with equal truth be a&s;&s;erted of every di&s;order known, as we have not <HI>a certain</HI> cure for any of them. Where there it a multiplicity of indications in di&s;ea&s;es (for methods of cure are not indications), it is impo&s;&s;ible for them all to give way to &s;pecific treatment; for various circum&s;tances will always require a combination of various remedies. Nor is the un&s;ucce&s;sful treatment of the kinkcough the rea&s;on why Dr. Willis's ob&s;ervation, <Q>"that old women are oftner con&s;ulted in this di&s;order than phy&s;icians,"</Q> holds true in our own times; for people &s;eldom apply to phy&s;icians, on account of the expence, as they do not apprehend danger, and they know the di&s;ea&s;e will commonly get well of it&s;elf in time. Neverthele&s;s, if you can make people believe that we have as yet no certain and effectual cure for the kinkcough, nor any one medicine that ought to be u&s;ed in many ca&s;es that occur, that every method hitherto followed is at be&s;t but a palliative, and that hemlock is a &s;pecific in every ca&s;e that can happen, your bu&s;ine&s;s is done.</P>
<P>But whether your being convinced that the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;pa&s;modic, and that hemlock is one of the be&s;t anti&s;pa&s;modics, will a&s;&s;i&s;t in recommend|ing it to the notice of practitioners in medicine,
<PB N="22" REF="33">may be much doubted; becau&s;e, as we have al|ready ob&s;erved, what you have &s;aid tends to per|&s;uade other people, that the di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;pa&s;|modic, but a morbid alteration of the inte&s;tinal contents; and it will ea&s;ily be di&s;covered whether medicines that clear the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and le&s;&s;en irri|tability, or a medicine which acts as an anti&s;pa&s;|modic only, are mo&s;t likely to prove palliatives.</P>
<P>However, though your rea&s;oning may have perplexed this matter, and though you may be mi&s;taken about the nature and the &s;eat of the dif|order in que&s;tion, yet it does not follow that you have not found out a remedy that will cure it, the u&s;e of medicine being often di&s;covered by acci|dent. The Indian who di&s;covered that the bark would cure an intermitting fever, knew nothing probably of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e; and <HI>as you have confined your practice in almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es to the u&s;e of hemlock,</HI> you may by chance have found out a cure for the kinkcough, and we mu&s;t, there|fore, &s;ee whether the evidence you produce will &s;upuort the character you give it.</P>
<P>A &s;pecific &s;hould be able to cure the di&s;ea&s;e to which it is appropriated without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, in order to have a clear proof of the efficacy of any medicine, it &s;hould be given &s;imply and alone; and it is therefore impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far hemlock, and how far the other remedies might contribute to the cure in your fir&s;t and fifth ca&s;es. Cantharides have always been found of great effi|cacy in the hooping-cough, whether taken in|wardly, or outwardly applied; nor have purging
<PB N="23" REF="34">medicines, e&s;pecially emetic tartar, &amp;c. by clear|ing the <HI>primae viae,</HI> been found le&s;s &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>Who can, therefore, &s;ay in Mrs. Hodgkin&s;on's ca&s;e, that the bli&s;ter and emetic tartar did not at|tenuate and remove the vi&s;cid phlegm, which was manife&s;tly the cau&s;e of the cough? Hemlock might then be &s;erviceable, by acting as an opiate, and allaying that increa&s;ed irritability, which the cau&s;e of every cough in a greater or le&s;s degree produces, and which often will occa&s;ion frequent coughing for &s;ome time after the primary di&s;ea&s;e is removed.</P>
<P>A. B. was better from the application of the fir&s;t bli&s;ter, and the effects of his purging mix|ture, which brought away &s;lime, before hemlock was given. Lancing the gum too would le&s;&s;en the increa&s;ed irritability of the whole habit, e&s;pe|cially the &s;econd operation, which let out three teeth at once, and yet the hemlock was con&s;tant|ly given: we find he coughed a good deal till a &s;econd bli&s;ter was applied, <HI>and then</HI> the fits were much milder, and returned &s;carcely once in two hours. Be&s;ides, the bowels were unloaded of &s;lime <HI>daily,</HI> either with &s;yrup of ro&s;es or manna; he was vomited with oxymel of &s;quills, which rendered his breathing free; and after five weeks and four days had elap&s;ed, in which time &s;ix teeth were bred, (and I &s;uppo&s;e came to light) the patient was well. And it may be a&s;ked, with what preten&s;ions could it be &s;aid in the third corol|lary, that <Q>"that hemlock certainly prevented &s;pa&s;ms, and probably convul&s;ions, in this child?"</Q>
<PB N="24" REF="35">Mu&s;t not there be a &s;trange partiality in favour of hemlock to make &s;uch a conclu&s;ion; and will not corollaries thus drawn lead to error?</P>
<P>But to go back to your writing to your friend in Scotland, p. 63. we may ob&s;erve, that it was unlucky that the children were got well before your letter of advice arrived, otherwi&s;e hemlock might have got the whole credit of the cure; and, though this anecdote does not throw great light upon the &s;ubject, yet perhaps it may fore&s;tall any claim a pretender may make to hints given; and you will thereby avoid that cen&s;ure you have be|fore experienced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Reviews.</NOTE>, in publi&s;hing as your own a method of curing the &s;tone by injection, when the hint came from Dr. Whytt.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e not being in&s;i&s;ted on as evi|dence, I pa&s;s it over; and the third does not &s;eem much to your purpo&s;e, becau&s;e hemlock was not given by it&s;elf; and who will be hardy enough to &s;ay, that lemon juice, &s;alt of tartar, and &s;yrup of &s;ugar, did not alter the properties of this remedy? and that the good effects were not produced by the manna, and a medicine very dif|ferent from hemlock when given alone? But the complete recovery &s;eems to have been accom|pli&s;hed, as often happens in this di&s;ea&s;e, by time, as nine or ten weeks elap&s;ed before the patient was in perfect health.</P>
<P>Indeed, you inform us, that &s;he was in a man|ner well in a much &s;horter time; but this we
<PB N="25" REF="36">imagine was nothing more than the natural de|cline of the cough, which always happens after a certain period.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, <Q>"a fever is not e&s;&s;ential to the kink|cough;"</Q> but in the cough following the mea&s;les, a fever, with a white tongue, quick pul&s;e, and &s;ediment in the urine, is a common attendant: and are not this fever and cough fre|quently increa&s;ed and renewed by eating things of hard dige&s;tion, or upon taking a &s;light cold? whence there is rea&s;on to imagine, that a great part of this child's illne&s;s was owing to acrid mat|ter remaining after the mea&s;les, upon, and irritat|ing the lungs. It is common for &s;aline medicines, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of hemlock, to make the phlegm loo&s;er in the cough thus produced; and this hectic fever and cough have often been cured by the &s;ame remedies, and gentle purging, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time: &s;o that, upon the whole, you may &s;ee this is not &s;o clear a ca&s;e in your favour as you have imagined.</P>
<P>The fourth ca&s;e too, communicated to you by Mr. Smith, is liable to the &s;ame objections, as not hemlock alone, but a medicine of a very different nature was given; and from a &s;erious peru&s;al of the fir&s;t five ca&s;es, the reader will judge, whether you had any good rea&s;on to be <HI>perfectly</HI> convinced that you had di&s;covered <Q>"an agreeable, certain, and expeditious cure for the kinkcough:"</Q> when, not having patients enow of your own, you wrote to Mr. Yorke to furni&s;h you with &s;ome for your purpo&s;e.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="37">
<P>But the fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es will do you very little &s;ervice; for, upon enquiry, the child did not take the medicine except a few days. The mo|ther not dreading the event of the di&s;order, did not chu&s;e to give it her by force, though it was regularly brought every evening about &s;ix o'clock, to be taken next day, but it was con&s;tantly thrown away. The mother &s;ays <Q>"the &s;mell of the <HI>hum|lucks</HI> &s;cented the whole hou&s;e, and was &s;o very di&s;agreeable, that the child could not bear it; and, &s;he believes, it would have thrown her daughter into fits if &s;he had per&s;i&s;ted in the u&s;e of this medicine."</Q> She, therefore, bought manna<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mother &s;ays, <Q>"tho&s;e days &s;he was purged with manna &s;he was much better than when &s;he took the humlucks."</Q></NOTE> at different places, with which &s;he kept her bowels open, and the di&s;order terminated, as often happens, in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>It is very common for the lower cla&s;s of people to omit taking medicines, even when they are to pay for them, becau&s;e they are unpalatable; and, I have &s;o often di&s;covered, that the medicines during a whole illne&s;s have been &s;ecreted, and not taken, that I am very cautious in a&s;cribing effects to them, unle&s;s I am very certain they have been given. The parents of the&s;e children had not thought of calling in any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but were &s;ent to, and de&s;ired to make trial of &s;ome medicine that &s;hould be given them; and common civility obliged them not to refu&s;e the offer; but when we re|flect, that giving medicines to children is always
<PB N="27" REF="38">trouble&s;ome, and requires great re&s;olution to ac|compli&s;h; that the common people do not look upon this di&s;order as dangerous, and that they have no doubt of it in general going off of its own accord, it is rea&s;onable to imagine, that they would not be equally vigorous with the pre&s;criber in pur&s;uing his method of cure, otherwi&s;e the pa|rents of HELE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Treati&s;e on the Kinkcough, p. 159.</NOTE> would not have di&s;u&s;ed the bark &s;hift which was given her; and, in my opinion, I think none of the&s;e ca&s;es are to be depended upon, where either the pre&s;criber or apothecary did not &s;ee the medicines given. However, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be taken, the ca&s;e of ELIZABETH and JOHN PAGE are exceptionable, becau&s;e lemon-juice and &s;alt of tartar were joined with hemlock; be&s;ides, ELIZABETH PAGE had the di&s;order from fir&s;t to la&s;t near &s;even weeks; and does not it of|ten terminate of it&s;elf in this time? We may con|clude, that JOHN PAGE had the di&s;order very &s;lightly, otherwi&s;e he would have kinked oftener than twice in the night.</P>
<P>Mary Green was not cured.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith, for all that we know, joined juice of lemon and &s;alt of tartar with hemlock, in the manner he had before done; and his ca&s;es, as they at pre&s;ent &s;tand, are therefore no evidence.</P>
<P>Thomas Newdale, who had the di&s;order near &s;even weeks, had &s;al polychre&s;t and magne&s;ia given to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cure.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="39">
<P>Magne&s;ia and &s;al polychre&s;t were al&s;o given in MARY HELE'S ca&s;e, but &s;he had no permanent relief till &s;he wore a bark &s;hift; and after taking hemlock a month, a violent diarrhea, with puru|lent &s;tools &s;treaked with blood, and a tene&s;mus came on, and &s;he was very re&s;tle&s;s, and vomited up her food; <HI>but, upon the hemlock mixture being omitted,</HI> and three drops of laudanum being given, and repeated every night and morning, her loo&s;ene&s;s was abated and cured, &s;he had good nights, and <HI>her cough, which the hemlock could not &s;ubdue,</HI> was intirely removed; and, we are told, &s;he got well: but of this hereafter.</P>
<P>WILLIAM TOPLIS had a variety of medicines joined to hemlock, notwith&s;tanding which he died, though, it is &s;aid, his kinkcough was cured a few days before his death, and at a time when he appears to have been very ill; but in the fol|lowing E&s;&s;ay we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice of hemlock, and we &s;hall then review this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mary Langley had the di&s;order in all &s;even weeks, and magne&s;ia and nitre were joined with hemlock; and, upon the whole we may ob&s;erve, that there are only &s;even ca&s;es out of the twenty, in which hemlock can po&s;&s;ibly have all the credit of the cure, becau&s;e other medicines were joined along with it; and if it was imagined they would give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, why were they pre&s;cribed? And even in all the&s;e &s;even ca&s;es, will not the &s;ugar of &s;ugar-candy rob the hemlock of its honour and
<PB N="29" REF="40">glory, becau&s;e &s;ugar, vegetable juice, and water will ferment? I know that this hemlock mixture will, in a few hours become ropy, and afterwards a fermentation en&s;ues, and it becomes vinous; and, though it may, like cow&s;lip wine, retain &s;omething of its narcotic quality, yet it will be greatly altered. Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that the mixture being to be taken in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, it has not time to ferment; but in the heat of May and June, when the&s;e children were ill, every body knows that this alteration will take place in a very few hours. Be&s;ides, ANNE ARCHER and ROBERT TRUSSEL were ill five weeks.</P>
<P>SAMUEL ARCHER one month.</P>
<P>ANCOR SARAH WADDLE and ELIZABETH TRUSSEL about two months. And you your&s;elf are &s;o well &s;atisfied that the&s;e ca&s;es are not &s;atis|factory, that you think it nece&s;&s;ary to explain &s;ome circum&s;tances in &s;ome of them:</P>
<P>We join you in opinion, p. 157, that the fifth ca&s;e may be as remarkable as any of the re&s;t, and yet not very remarkable in favour of hemlock. Any man mu&s;t be &s;trangely bia&s;&s;ed in favour of this medicine, who could conclude, when &s;o many other medicines had given relief, that it &s;aved this patient's life; and from what has been &s;aid, it is plain you were mi&s;taken in a&s;cribing the cure <HI>of all</HI> the &s;ix patients to hemlock. But you &s;eem to be ea&s;ily convinced, otherwi&s;e you would not have attempted to per&s;uade others it was effectual where the di&s;ea&s;e was not cured; for you have
<PB N="30" REF="41">artfully numbered Mary Green among tho&s;e made well by this remedy, though her ca&s;e proves the contrary; and her mother &s;ays, &s;he did not get well of at lea&s;t &s;ix months after &s;he had quite done taking this medicine. You &s;ay, <Q>"I &s;aw all the four patients cured by Mr. Yorke (Mary Green being one of them), and &s;ome of them before they were well; and I enquired very minutely into their &s;everal &s;ymptoms, and this was only that I might have every po&s;&s;ible te&s;ti|mony for facts, which I de&s;ired to deliver to the world with the utmo&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their reality."</Q> Surely this is &s;training a point, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, to give credit to hemlock; and how are we to believe you, when you thus &s;olemnly attempt to impo&s;e upon us?</P>
<P>Curing Thomas Newdale twice in a fortnight was really extravagant; once well done would have been quite &s;ufficient, as the di&s;order &s;eizes a per&s;on but once in his life. But notwith&s;tanding what may have been &s;aid to the contrary, (&s;ee ca&s;e 17) HELE does not &s;eem to have been cured once. Poor child! She indeed &s;uffered much hard&s;hip, &s;eemingly from being trifled with, when the u&s;e of the bark was &s;o early indicated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">You knew an ague had been cured by the bark when complicated with the kinkcough, (&s;ee Treat.

<PB N="31" REF="42">might have been numbered among the living in|&s;tead of the dead, as her con&s;titution might not have been ruined, and &s;he might have been able to bear a bla&s;t of wind. But you were con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elf in adhering to your opinion, that hemlock does not only cure the kinkcough, but the ague al&s;o; and the con&s;equence was, that &s;he together with TOPLIS are in heaven; and, it may be in&s;i&s;ted on, that hemlock did good &s;ervice in the&s;e in&s;tances, by &s;tanding in the place of pro|per remedies, and &s;uffering the di&s;order to carry the&s;e infants into happine&s;s.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, &s;ir, how willing I am to help you out at a dead lift; and in the E&s;&s;ay annexed, the loo&s;e|ne&s;s which probably a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying HELE to her grave, will be accounted for, without having recour&s;e to conjecture, and the nece&s;&s;ity of killing and de&s;troying worms for the purpo&s;e; though I admire your ingenious theory of the&s;e vermin, be|ing obliged by uncommon heat to &s;eek their way out of the body by a voluntary effort, in the &s;ame manner. I &s;uppo&s;e, as people make a voluntary effort to get out of a window, or a back door, when a hou&s;e is on fire. But there is another way of ex|plaining this matter; and the reader will pre&s;ent|ly judge whether it ought not to have been known to one who is a fellow of a royal college of phy|&s;icians.</P>
<P>But after all, I find you have been endeavour|ing to make us give credit to what you your&s;elf do not believe; for, if you had been perfectly convinced, that in hemlock you had di&s;covered a
<PB N="32" REF="43">certain and expeditious cure for the kinkcough, you would not in the la&s;t ca&s;e but one, <Q>"have been perpetually wavering between the influ|ence of a great name, and the &s;ugge&s;tion of your own rea&s;on and experience."</Q> From this declaration it is evident, you wanted in|ward conviction from plain proof; for a man mu&s;t be an errant fool indeed, who gives up a plain matter of fact, of which he is perfectly con|vinced, to the influence of any name how great &s;oever. And we a&s;k the opinion of tho&s;e uncon|cerned in this matter, whether they think you were perfectly convinced or not?</P>
<P>Your laying the death of HELE to the mi&s;con|duct of her parents, and excu&s;ing the want of &s;peedy &s;ucce&s;s to a &s;moaky hou&s;e, &amp;c. in TOP|LIS'S, LANGLEY'S<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a curious excu&s;e, it being confe&s;&s;ed, that they were not confined within doors, p. 161.</NOTE>, and WADLEY'S ca&s;es, will avail but little in favour of your remedy, when it is called to mind, that you have long in&s;en&s;ibly fallen into this way of excu&s;ing your&s;elf by the mo&s;t trifling eva&s;ions, when, having promi&s;ed a recovery, death, by victory, has &s;hewn the feeble|ne&s;s of the weapons by which you endeavoured to keep him at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From the whole it mu&s;t appear to every un|bia&s;&s;ed reader, that hemlock has not always been &s;ucce&s;sful in the kinkcough; that other me|dicines were required, both when it was &s;imple and when the di&s;ea&s;e was complicated, and that

<P>The very &s;ame means is recommended in this complication as for the &s;imple kinkcough; be|cau&s;e a child who u&s;ed to part with a great num|ber of round worms, had &s;ome come away while it was taking this medicine (&s;ee ca&s;e 11.) and, for this rea&s;on, we are to believe, that hemlock will, in &s;uch ca&s;es, often &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e not only of laxatives, but of any other medicines whatever in the cure of both di&s;orders.</P>

<P>Again, hemlock is the <HI>fac totum,</HI> becau&s;e <Q>"it does not appear that the bark was more effica|cious than hemlock in poor HELE's ca&s;e"</Q> (17); only that the bark &s;hift intirely removed the ague, which was not cured while the hemlock was de|pended on as a febrifuge. Indeed, on the ninth of March it appears from the ca&s;e, that &s;he had neither ague nor fever, but on the tenth it return|ed; and on the twelfth, things were in &s;uch a &s;tate, that recour&s;e was immediately had to the bark &s;hift, and opium, with a good effect. But &s;uppo&s;|ing the ague fit to be removed for a little time previous to the u&s;e of the bark, why is this to be attributed to hemlock?

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE HOOPING-COUGH.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has a mind to &s;ee what has been &s;aid by former writers upon this &s;ub|ject, a few of the ancients excepted, may con-Dr. MILLAR's late ob&s;ervations on the hooping|cough, where they will find that phy&s;icians be|fore the days of Dr. B&mdash;, had employed &s;uc|ce&s;sfully &s;ome of their thoughts on the nature and cure of this di&s;order; and the following &s;hort E&s;&s;ay is intended to &s;hew whether the method and medicines they recommend, or that advi&s;ed by Dr. B&mdash;, is mo&s;t likely to relieve the pa|tient.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, we will begin by taking an ab&s;tract from notes made in 1749, when the hooping-cough prevailed in this place and neigh|bourhood; and we chu&s;e to relate the &s;ymptoms
<PB N="40" REF="50">attending tho&s;e children where the di&s;order took its cour&s;e without help from medicine, as from hence we &s;hall learn its regular progre&s;s, and the&s;e we had many opportunities of &s;eeing, as the common people knowing that the di&s;order com|monly wears off of it&s;elf in time, were not &s;oli|citous about medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but relied on &s;uch trifling remedies as them&s;elves thought mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring, which was moi&s;t and very cold, many children in the &s;pace of four or five miles round this place were &s;eized with the hoop|ing-cough, about the &s;ame time, which fir&s;t be|gan with a little dry cough, and &s;ometimes the &s;ame kind of indi&s;po&s;ition as accompanies taking cold, but &s;oon after ropy phlegm was coughed up. After this the lungs and &s;tomach were daily loaded with a larger quantity of phlegm, which in &s;ome became immoderate.</P>
<P>After &s;ome, or all of this phlegm was di&s;charg|ed by a fit of coughing and vomiting, the child became ea&s;y till a &s;ufficient quantity was again ac|cumulated to excite another fit of coughing, &amp;c. during which, &s;trong children often bled at the no&s;e, and were black in the face: the phlegm di&s;|charged was &s;ometimes &s;treaked with blood, and the countenance in a little while acquired a luco|phlegmatic appearance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e children who had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;pit out the phlegm at the time of coughing, got &s;afely over the di&s;order; &s;ometimes, where it was not very trouble&s;ome, in about &s;ix weeks; where more
<PB N="41" REF="51">violent, in about two months, and &s;ometimes it was three months, or longer, before it terminat|ed. But &s;ome younger children fared not &s;o well, for in&s;tead of throwing the phlegm out of their mouth they &s;wallowed it; a griping and loo&s;e &s;tools followed, and all the parts about the anus were excoriated. At this time they became dry, had a quick &s;mall pul&s;e, and all the other &s;ymp|toms accompanying a fever. They now daily got weaker, their legs and body became more or le&s;s oedematous, the cough gradually cea&s;ed, the difficulty of breathing became more urgent, &s;leepi|ne&s;s, &amp;c. came on; and when the parents thought their children getting better, death convinced them of their mi&s;take, by clo&s;ing the &s;cene with all the &s;ymptoms of a <HI>&s;purious peripneu|mony.</HI></P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e it often hap|pened in different parts of the neighbourhood, that the cough was better for two or three days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"It is worthy of remark, that the convul&s;ive cough in Edinburgh, after being milder in January 1735, &s;uddenly became much wor&s;e in the fir&s;t week in February, and con|tinued &s;o the greater part of that month, gradually decrea&s;|ing afterwards as the &s;pring and &s;ummer advanced." <BIBL>Ed. Med. E&s;&s;. vol. iv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, and then returned again with its u&s;ual violence, but towards the latter part of &s;ummer it wholly di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms give us every rea&s;on to con|clude, with other writers, that the di&s;order is cau&s;ed by &s;ome morbid di&s;po&s;ition of the air, be|cau&s;e

<P>In &s;upport of the &s;econd opinion, it may be &s;aid, that we know a particular &s;tate of the air under a lax habit, and &s;uch are children, will render the lymph ropy, witne&s;s the &s;purious pe|ripneumony which children we &s;ee in this di&s;order fall into when the offending matter is not expelled in coughing. And in favour of both the&s;e opi|nions it may be &s;aid, the di&s;ea&s;e is not confined to the lungs, or to the alimentary canal, but that
<PB N="43" REF="53">it is extended to the whole body; the fibres in ge|neral being relaxed, and an oedematous appear|ance evinces, that the lymph in general has ac|quired a pituitous di&s;po&s;ition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some writers have a&s;&s;erted, that the juices never acquire this di&s;po&s;ition; they &s;hould have added while they were circu|lating in the ve&s;&s;els; for upon di&s;&s;ecting an oedematous leg, I found the fluids which had &s;tagnated in the cellular membrane gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">y and re&s;embling the white of an egg.</NOTE>; and, be&s;ides, it does not appear that mucus but thickened lymph is di&s;charged.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the la&s;t opinion, nothing can be &s;aid till we are certain that it is mucus alone which is di&s;charged in the fit of coughing, and then there could be no doubt but in this di&s;ea&s;e the mucous glands are chiefly fir&s;t affected. The&s;e different opinions we mention to &s;hew what un|certainty there is in fixing the manner in which the immediate cau&s;e of this di&s;order acts, and what parts of the body are fir&s;t affected; and, therefore, all the plain truth we can collect is, that in con&s;e|quence of a particular &s;tate in the air, the &s;to|mach and lungs are loaded with a tough vi&s;cid phlegm, and that there is a weakne&s;s and a gene|ral tendency to relaxation in the fibres, and to a ropy di&s;po&s;ition of the lymph and &s;erum; that an affection of the &s;tomach and lungs is the imme|diate cau&s;e of the cough, becau&s;e the patient im|mediately becomes ea&s;y by vomiting and expecto|ration.</P>
<P>That the lungs and &s;tomach are chiefly, and more immediately affected in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the

Be&s;ides, when it is not evacuated upwards, a new train of &s;ymptoms will ari&s;e; for accumulating in the &s;tomach, it pa&s;&s;es into the inte&s;tines, putrifies, and becomes very acrid; and the que&s;tion is, whether if the inte&s;tines were the primary &s;eat of the di&s;|ea&s;e, this putrefaction and a con&s;equent diarrhaea would not always take place, and whether the phlegm would not all pa&s;s downward in&s;tead of upward? Whereas the truth is, unload the &s;to|mach and lungs as of ten as an accumulation of vi&s;cid phlegm takes place, and the bowels will not &s;eem to be much affected.</P>
<P>However, it is not matter of much con&s;e|quence in practice, whether phlegm fir&s;t re&s;ides in the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines, as the whole ali|mentary canal from its connection mu&s;t be more or le&s;s affected with phlegm <HI>during</HI> the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e; and &s;eeing that the patient becomes ea&s;y upon its being di&s;charged, and that a general weakne&s;s and vi&s;cidity prevails, the true intentions of the cure mu&s;t be, to clear repeatedly the lungs and <HI>prime viae,</HI> to attenuate vi&s;cid phlegm, to in|vigorate the blood, and to pre&s;erve the &s;trength of the &s;olids; and, by taking a view of preceding writers, we &s;hall find, that the medicines which have an&s;wered the&s;e ends, have been found mo&s;t &s;erviceable in curing this di&s;order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this hereafter appears to be true, tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t on hemlock's being a &s;pecific, becau&s;e it is anti&s;pa&s;modic, do not &s;eem to have &s;een this matter in its true light.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="46" REF="56">cough, and only differs from the hooping-cough in its degree of violence; for, though in this la&s;t there is a vomiting and coughing mixed, yet when we reflect upon the action of coughing, and the parts concerned, we &s;hall di&s;cover it to be a minor vomiting, and that of cour&s;e a deeper in|&s;piration and greater force in coughing will en&s;ue, when the cau&s;e is &s;eated in the &s;tomach than when it only re&s;ides about the lungs.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, there is a difference in the nature of the cau&s;e of coughs, &s;ome being entirely the con&s;equence of irritated matter, while others ari&s;e from a di&s;ea&s;e in the nerves them&s;elves, which ren|der them &s;o very irritable that a fit of coughing comes on from any &s;light accident that may hap|pen to effect the nerves of the lungs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This kind of cough is cured by removing the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e in the nerves, and by medicines which have a power of taking off increa&s;ed irritability, &s;uch as myrrh, gum ammo|niacum, opium, camphire, bark, and the like.</NOTE>; but the cough of which we are now treating, is acknow|ledged to ari&s;e from the former of the&s;e cau&s;es. Nor could it ever be cured by irritating medicines if it was entirely nervous; and we &s;hall, therefore, proceed to ob&s;erve, that every cough is an effort of nature to expel the irritating matter, and though, when violent, it may always be mitigated with &s;afe|ty and advantage, yet wherever it is accompanied with an accumulation of phlegm, or the like, it ought never to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed intirely, unle&s;s we can al&s;o at the &s;ame time remove this preterna|tural flux. <Q>"Opiates rather did hurt in the

<P>Neverthele&s;s, when we give only one, two, of three drops of laudanum in a day, without entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the cough, it &s;ufficiently le&s;&s;ens the ir|ritability of the whole habit, and gives the pa|tient relief, by preventing the nerves from being &s;o violently affected. Dr. Hillary &s;ays, <Q>"a little &s;yr. mecon. or elix. paregoric."</Q> (joined with other medicines), &s;eldom fails to render the di&s;ea&s;e more moderate, and in time takes it off: and the only deficiency I can &s;ee in the practice of phy&s;icians in general is, that they have omitted to join <HI>very &s;mall do&s;es</HI> of opium along with the me|dicines they have given to remove the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Whereas Dr. B&mdash; gives an opiate joined to purges; for we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, that hemlock, by his manner of mixing it, may be converted into a purge; and when this does not happen, he joins other purges along with it, &s;o that while he is crying up hemlock as a &s;pecific,
<PB N="48" REF="58">he is in a great mea&s;ure carrying off the di&s;ea&s;e by medicines recommended by former writers.</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved the nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing the <HI>primae viae</HI> and lungs clear of phlegm, and this we are not to expect from hemlock, unle&s;s by accident, for though it &s;ometimes purges, <Q>"yet it often does not &s;en&s;ibly affect any &s;ecretion;"</Q> and, therefore, is not in this ca&s;e to be &s;olely de|pended upon. When it is ju&s;t mixed with &s;ugar and water, or given in extract or powder, it, like other opiates, &s;tops immediate &s;ecretion, and pro|motes &s;weat; but when the hemlock mixture has &s;tood till it ferments, it opens the bowels in the &s;ame manner as &s;ugar-candy and the juice of penny-royal when they have &s;tood together &s;ome time, &s;o that this purgative quality is not inherent in hemlock, but ari&s;es from its being in a &s;tate of fermentation; nor does it any way appear that it has an attenuating property, or that it is capable of invigorating the blood and &s;olids, or of unload|ing the lungs when they are overcharged with phlegm; whence, though hemlock like opium may &s;uppre&s;s the cough and vomiting, yet the <HI>di&s;|order</HI> is long in terminating under its u&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patients would probably have been well in the &s;ame time if they had not taken any medicines at all.</NOTE>, becau&s;e it is de&s;titute of other properties which are nece&s;|&s;ary to complete a cure. Peripneumonic &s;ymp|toms, bleeding at the no&s;e and eyes, and the phlegm being &s;treaked with blood, are &s;urely &s;ymptoms which &s;ometimes require the u&s;e of the
<PB N="49" REF="59">lancet, admitting it to protract the di&s;ea&s;e, for as hemlock, by Dr. B&mdash;'s own account, is a week at lea&s;t in making a cure, may not in this time a rupture of a ve&s;&s;el in the lungs or brain happen, and de&s;troy the patient? It is confe&s;&s;ed, that ac|cidental bleedings have &s;ometimes done good; and is it not amazing, that a man who has &s;een pe|ripneumonic &s;ymptoms complicated with the hoop|ing-cough) &s;hould in all ca&s;es tru&s;t the life of the patient entirely to a favourite anti&s;pa&s;modic?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t evidently appear from what has been &s;aid, that various remedies will here ever be nece&s;|&s;ary; and as an opiate of &s;ome kind or other will in this cough always be a u&s;eful ingredient, it re|mains for us to enquire, whether &s;mall do&s;es of laudanum or hemlock ought to have the prefer|ence. For this purpo&s;e we will relate a ca&s;e or two, which have fallen under our own in&s;pection, and the reader him&s;elf may judge which is the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t remedy to cure the cough by le&s;&s;en|ing irritability.</P>
<P>A gentlewoman having an incurable &s;chirrus, took, by the advice of two eminent phy&s;icians, &s;even grains of hemlock twice a day, which in a little time brought on an itching of the whole body.

<P>Another lady took fourteen grains of the leaves of hemlock made into a powder twice a day, and
<PB N="50" REF="60">a poultice of the &s;ame herb was applied to an in|dolent tumour, occa&s;ioned by milk &s;tagnating in the upper part of her brea&s;t; the &s;ame kind of itching and bli&s;ters we have mentioned followed accompanied by an inflammation re&s;embling a malignant ery&s;ipelas, which &s;welled her more or le&s;s all over, but in particular her head; her eyes were affected; &s;he &s;ometimes complained of a ver|tigo; the brea&s;t, upon which the poultice was laid, was &s;pread over with fiery eruptions, and indeed her whole body &s;eemed to be poi&s;oned. She was full of pain, had re&s;tle&s;s nights, and a fever; but upon leaving off this dangerous remedy, and tak|ing proper remedies, &s;he narrowly e&s;caped death, and was re&s;tored to perfect health. I have &s;een other &s;imilar ca&s;es; but, perhaps it may be &s;aid, it does not often produce the&s;e effects, which mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome idio&s;yncra&s;y in the&s;e patients.

For my own part, I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure followed Dr. Burton's method in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, except, that in&s;tead of cantharides I have cho&s;en antimony as an attenuant, and I have given lau|danum in very &s;mall do&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The rule is to give as much laudanum as will le&s;&s;en the cough without &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of it intirely; one drop I find it com|monly enough for the purpo&s;e, taken in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours in a child of half a year old; two drops in one of a year old; three drops, two or three years old; four drops, four years old, &amp;c. but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to continue increa&s;ing the do&s;e according to the age of the patient, a le&s;s quantity, in proportion, being &s;ufficient, which is probably owing to the very irritable &s;tate of young children.</NOTE> for the purpo&s;e already mentioned.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="62">
<P>If the child is plethoric and bleeds at the no&s;e, or if the phlegm di&s;charged is &s;treaked with blood, I take &s;ome blood away from the arm to prevent any farther rupture of the ve&s;&s;els. But I agree with Dr. Burton and others, that blood mu&s;t be taken away with great caution; for, as we &s;ee this di&s;order renders the fibres weak, and the juices ropy, &s;o bleeding, by &s;till weakening them, will increa&s;e the complaint, and therefore, too large a di&s;charge of blood will be greatly injurious. On|ly &s;o much blood mu&s;t be then taken away as is &s;ufficient to prevent a rupture of the ve&s;&s;els, and this mu&s;t be judged from the violence of the cough, together with the &s;trength of the patient.</P>
<P>Where the &s;tomach, &amp;c. are much loaded, I give a vomit of oxymel of &s;quills, or rather &s;ome of the preparation of antimony; afterwards the child is purged gently every day with rhubarb and &s;al polychre&s;t; and, at the &s;ame time, is taken three or four times a day, a do&s;e proportioned to the &s;trength and age of the patient, of a medicine compo&s;ed of the bark decoction, e&s;&s;ence of anti|mony, &s;yrup of pennyroyal, and laudanum, which very &s;oon le&s;&s;ens, and &s;hortly intirely removes the whole of this complaint.</P>
<P>Where the child is very young, a medicine com|po&s;ed of &s;yrup of pennyroyal, e&s;&s;ence of antimony, and laudanum, will be more readily got down; and provided the &s;yrup is made of expre&s;&s;ed juice without boiling, and given while it is in a ferment|ing &s;tate, it will purge &s;ufficiently; and, I will ven|ture to affirm, &s;ooner relieve the patient than the
<PB N="53" REF="63">poi&s;on with which the malefactors of the Atheni|ans were de&s;troyed; and if the child wears at the &s;ame time a bark &s;hift, a complete cure will &s;oon be the con&s;equence; though it may be &s;ometimes requi&s;ite to add oxymel to this mixture, where a quantity of phlegm upon the lungs makes its u&s;e nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Hitherto then we have only con&s;idered the cure of the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;hall now pro|ceed to the &s;econd, which generally ari&s;es from neglect in not clearing the <HI>primae viae</HI> by art, when the efforts of nature to expel the offending matter by the mouth are not accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In this &s;tage we have full evidence, that the lungs, the &s;tomach, and the inte&s;tines are all affected, be|cau&s;e a &s;purious peripneumony invades the little patient, at the &s;ame time that the phlegm, which pa&s;&s;es from the &s;tomach into the inte&s;tines, brings on a diarrhoea that may end in a dy&s;entery, if the child happens to live. Neverthele&s;s, this &s;ymp|tom is not without its advantages, where the child happens to be troubled with worms, for the mat|ter which cau&s;es it is a, mo&s;t powerful vermifuge. The mucus with which children's bowels are lined, is a proper nidus for the breeding and increa&s;e of the&s;e vermin, and there is not any thing more powerfully di&s;&s;olves and de&s;troys this a&s;ylum than putrid matter, when they are expelled along with the faeces.</P>
<P>The coming away of worms is often the con|&s;equence of inoculation, when the variolous mat|ter has contaminated the whole ma&s;s of humours,
<PB N="54" REF="64">and part of it enters the inte&s;tines. A boy ac|cidentally broke a penknife blade in the nates, where part of it remained &s;ome time, and form|ed a &s;inous ulcer, which collected and retained a con&s;iderable quantity of matter, that became putrid by &s;tagnation. The more active parts of this matter being ab&s;orbed, brought on a diarrhoea, in which an incredible number of worms both dead and living came away, and thus entirely cured the lad of a di&s;ea&s;e under which he had long laboured. I could indeed produce many &s;imilar in&s;tances, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient to &s;hew tho&s;e unacquainted with the&s;e things, that the, &s;limy matter which comes away in fevers is not the &s;kins of dead worms; nor are we to believe, without farther evidence, that the child has the worms, but that it is the mucus of the inte&s;tines &s;et at liberty by putrid matter, and then di&s;charg|ed in the common manner.</P>
<P>However, though we look upon putrid mat|ter in the inte&s;tines as a remedy in &s;ome ca&s;es, we are not to forget that it is a di&s;ea&s;e; and, therefore, rhubarb and &s;permaceti &s;hould be given as often as nece&s;&s;ary, to clear the bowels, which may after|wards be defended from acrid matter, and healed by taking &s;tarch, mutton &s;uet di&s;&s;olved in milk, or the pulv. c. chele. e. and &s;permaceti mixed; and the common &s;aline julep, with e&s;&s;ence of antimony in it, will be found &s;erviceable in abating the fever: but above all things, bli&s;ters are mo&s;t u&s;e|ful, for when the load of phlegm upon the lungs has been exce&s;&s;ive great, the cough cea&s;ed, and
<PB N="55" REF="65">an oedema has appeared all over the body, I have frequently &s;een, after they have di&s;charg|ed a little, the cough return with a large ex|pectoration of phlegm, and the little patient there|by &s;natched from the jaws of death. Neverthele&s;s, medicines proper for the &s;purious peripneumony may, if needful, here take place; and when the fever is abated, and the difficulty of breathing re|moved, the blood and fibres mu&s;t be invigorated, by having recour&s;e to the bark, to which bees wax or &s;permaceti may be added, if an excoration of the bowels &s;till require their u&s;e. But if the hooping-cough does depend upon &s;ome peculiar di&s;po&s;ition in the air, &s;urely the child &s;hould be re|moved into an air where this di&s;po&s;ition does not prevail, any thing &s;aid to the contrary not|with&s;tanding.</P>
