<HEAD>THE PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>_EVery Body is convinced, that Men are created for Society-&s;ake; and no Body is ignorant, that without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a great many others, he would be more mi&s;erable than a Bea&s;t it&s;elf. But every Body is not convinc'd, that it is naturally impo&s;|&s;ible, to become happy or rich, without contributing proportionably towards the Happine&s;s or Riches of others. At lea&s;t the Experience we have every Day of a great many People's building their Happine&s;s and Riches upon the Ruins of others, evidenceth clearly, that either they mu&s;t be &s;tark mad, or are not convinc'd that in &s;o doing, they are acting again&s;t their own Intere&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, there is nothing more true and nothing more de&s;erving our Attention than the Welfare of others, in Ca&s;e we have a Mind to be happy our&s;elves: It is nothing el&s;e but a Pre|vention, to think, that Riches do con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great Quantity of Goods, and that &s;uch a Quantity of Goods hath a &s;overeign Virtue, to free our&s;elves from all Troubles and Accidents. Since Men are not able to live without the per&s;onal Mini&s;try of others, true Riches have no other Vir|tue
<PB N="iv" REF="3">than what is given them by the Will, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Power, and the Number of &s;uch, who are to make U&s;e thereof; they have no Value and no Price in them&s;elves, but what they receive from this Number; and accordingly as this Will, this Power, and this Number is pre&s;erved, accordingly our pretended Riches have an E&s;timation. Without it, they are no more than Du&s;t.</P>
<P>An infinite Number of <HI>Examples</HI> as well antient as modern do convince us thereof, and I have in a <HI>particular Treati&s;e on the Way and Means to get Rich,</HI> now ready for the Pre&s;s, purpo&s;ely endea|vour'd to give a full Demon&s;tration of this Truth, where I remit the curious Reader. I &s;hall only in this Place draw a Conclu&s;ion from what I have &s;aid, which is, that if our Riches have no other Value and E&s;timation than what is given them by an infi|nite Number of others, and if we cannot be rich without them, it is evident, that in&s;tead of ruining others contrary to our Intere&s;t, we ought proportio|nably to contribute towards the Pre&s;ervation of this Will, this Power, and this Number; and in ca&s;e we really do intend to get rich and happy, we ought to be in Harmony with &s;uch as are to give a Value and a Price to our Sub&s;tance; and as we do not know preci&s;ely, who is to give a Value to our Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, we ought to regard every Body as &s;uch.</P>
<P>If every Body is to be con&s;ider'd, to be of the Number of &s;uch as are to give a Value to our Riches, and if without the per&s;onal Mini&s;try of Men we cannot live, it is our Intere&s;t to have them in a Condition to render the &s;ame; if this Number liveth for us, their Condition mu&s;t be perfect in Con&s;equence, that their Service may be perfect and intire. Their Bodies mu&s;t be brought to the De|gree of natural Perfection, that their Organs may be well di&s;pos'd to receive the Commandments of Un|der&s;tanding and Will, wherewith they are animated
<PB N="v" REF="4">for our Service and for our Pre&s;ervation, and that the Inactivity and the Defects of their Bodies may not hinder the Activity of their Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>This is the total Sum of the Obligations we lye under in Ca&s;e we love our own Intere&s;t. It is therefore a pernicious Enviou&s;ne&s;s in &s;ome, who, be|ing Ma&s;ter of &s;ome good Invention for &s;hortening and making ea&s;y the Labours and Fatigues of their Fellow-Creatures, choo&s;e rather to keep it in their Clo&s;ets as an idle Object of their Curio&s;ity, than to have the Publick reap the Advantage thereof, which con&s;equently would be beneficial to them&s;elves by rea&s;on of the Maxim I have before, advanc'd.</P>
<P>If &s;uch an Enviou&s;ne&s;s is to be blamed in re&s;pect of Inventions for &s;hortening and making ea&s;y the Labours and Fatigues of Men; it is the more in re&s;pect of Di&s;coveries tending towards the Pre&s;er|vation and Re&s;toring of Health; and I may boldly &s;ay, that &s;uch as are backwards therein, are in &s;ome Mea&s;ure an&s;werable for the Langui&s;hings and Suf|ferings of their Fellow-creatures. The Life and Health of a &s;ingle Per&s;on is more precious than all what vulgarly we under&s;tand under the Notion of Riches; not &s;o much for rea&s;on of the Excellency of the Structure of a Man, but becau&s;e Wealth and Riches can never exi&s;t without a Number of People, who are to give it its Value and E&s;timation. With|out it, it is a Chimaera and no more than Du&s;t; con|&s;equently the more this Number increa&s;eth, the more Value our pretended Riches are receiving, and con&s;equently the more richer we actually become.</P>
<P>Few are ignorant of the great Uncertainty we labour under in Phy&s;icks; and I &s;hould think, it would not be out of the Way, if Phy&s;icians would follow the Example of Painters, who for the more excelling in their Art have divided them&s;elves in &s;everal Branches. Some apply them&s;elves only to Painting of Faces, &s;ome of Land&s;kips, &s;ome of Bat|tle
<PB N="vi" REF="5">Pieces, and even &s;ome only to paint Flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By this Way each one cometh to a Degree of Per|fection. The Object of Phy&s;ick being the re&s;tor|ing and pre&s;erving of our Health, a Con&s;ideration far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all others of what Nature &s;oever, it is evident, that the Art of Phy&s;ick, in&s;tead of being founded only upon Probabilities, would attain to a Degree of Certainty, if each Phy&s;ician would direct his Attention only to certain Di&s;ea&s;es and publi&s;h the Di&s;coveries made in Curing them. <HI>Dum &s;inguli pugnant, omnes vincuntur.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t able&s;t Phy&s;icians do acknowledge that oftentimes they are at a Lo&s;s in forming a &s;olid Judgment of the Di&s;ea&s;es of their Patients; and I am &s;ure, that not &s;eldom the Remedy pre&s;cribed in &s;uch a Perplexity is wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. Why do we refu&s;e then to make U&s;e of Magnetical Reme|dies experienc'd by our Ance&s;tors and left by them upon Record to Po&s;terity? and why do we refu&s;e to make a farther Enquiry into the Virtues of &s;uch Re|medies? The U&s;e thereof would at lea&s;t never be detrimental, nor is there to be apprehended, that the Practice of &s;uch Remedies is liable to prove more fatal than the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A great deal more could be &s;aid in Prai&s;e of Mag|netical Cures, but as <HI>Experientia &s;emel in&s;tituta plus valet quam mille rationes,</HI> I appeal to the Authors quoted in this Treati&s;e, and content my&s;elf to have fulfill'd the Duty every Body lyeth under, which is, to contribute proportionably to the Happine&s;s of others in ca&s;e we pretend to be happy our&s;elves. And as the Method di&s;cover'd for curing Wounds without Pains and without an immediate Applicati|on of Remedies, hath been &s;ufficiently experienc'd, and always found to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e, I hope it will be receiv'd with the &s;ame Candour as it is di&s;|cover'd.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE VIRTUE and Efficient CAUSE OF MAGNETICAL CURES.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is needle&s;s, to give a Definition of what is under&s;tood by Magneti|cal Cures. Since the Invention of a certain Powder made of Vitriol calcin'd, or rather ex&s;iccated by the Reverberation of the Sun-beams, commonly call'd <HI>Sympathetical Pow|der,</HI> People &s;eem almo&s;t to be convinc'd, that there is another Way for Curing, chiefly certain Wounds, than by an immediate Application of certain Reme|dies to the Part afflicted. Only the Difference lieth herein, that a great many either out of Prevention, or perhaps &s;ometimes out of Ignorance or Self-inte|re&s;t, &s;tiffly maintain, that the Cau&s;e of &s;uch Cures is in nothing el&s;e to be look'd for, than in the Super|&s;tition
<PB N="8" REF="7">of certain People. Some go &s;till farther, and do a&s;cribe the Virtue to certain Ceremonies and even to Charms. Of the la&s;t Opinion are at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> Day few, more of the fir&s;t; and it &s;eems, as if this opi|nion was &s;upported by the Experience it&s;elf made by many People, with the &s;aid Sympathetical Powder to no Purpo&s;e; which hath given Room to them to &s;ay, that the Effects of this Powder, if there are any, are only vi&s;ible according to the more or le&s;&s;er Share of Super&s;tition, the Per&s;on is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with, who maketh U&s;e thereof. Moreover the little Practice made with this Powder, tho' nothing at all expen&s;ive, and though the Advantage of Novelty it hath, is again an other Argument by which they &s;trive to evidence, that there is no relying at all on this Remedy.</P>
<P>In my Opinion both Parties are equally to be blamed. The one, for a&s;cribing to a Thing more than really is in it, or can be produced by its Inter|vention, though all imaginable Care is taken in the Preparation of it; and the other, for deriding every Thing they are not able to comprehend with their Sen&s;es. My Intention is therefore here, to con&s;ider on the efficient Cau&s;e of Magnetical Cures, which will be a Means to prove the Po&s;&s;ibility there|of; and this being done, I &s;hall conclude with pub|li&s;hing for the Good of the Publick, a Method to be depended upon, and hitherto kept as a Secret in private Families, for magnetically curing certain Wounds without Pains and without the Application of any Remedy.</P>
<P>There is a Kind of Affection between all and every Thing, by Virtue of which, they alter or af|fect one another without a vi&s;ible Touching. The daily Experience convinceth us thereof, and who de|nieth it,
<Q>O&s;tendi Solem po&s;tulat ille &s;ibi.</Q></P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>The Examination and Knowledge of the&s;e Quali|ties and hidden Virtues in Nature, is call'd natural Magick, founded upon the Sympathies of Things, and who is acquainted with the Concord or Di&s;cord therein, is call'd &s;kilful in Magicks, and able to produce many marvelous Effects, appearing to the Vulgar to be contriv'd by the Help of Daemons; though this My&s;tery is nothing el&s;e, but a Science of the Sympathies and Antipathies between &s;uperi|our and inferiour Things.</P>
<P>Sympathy is a mutual Con&s;ent between Phy&s;ical and Natural Things, by which they friendly embrace one another, call'd by &s;ome a Compa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Galen</HI> u&s;eth the Word of Friend&s;hip, <HI>Pliny</HI> Concord, and <HI>Tully</HI> a Conveniency and natural Continuation; for though the Bodies of Iron and a Load&s;tone are di&s;tant from one another, neverthele&s;s Nature is al&s;o continued in them, that they agree or meet in one. The &s;ame calleth it an Affinity in Nature, and <HI>Bapt. Porta</HI> a Con&s;ent; by others it is metaphorically named a Symphony or Harmony. Antipathy is a mutual Affection between Things, by virtue of which they &s;hun, abhor, or are again&s;t one another. <HI>Galen</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> are calling it a Fighting and Di&s;cord; others a Di&s;&s;enting, Enmity, Variance and Hatred; others a Re&s;i&s;tance, as hindering or re&s;i&s;ting Actives to be applied to Pa&s;&s;ives.</P>
<P>As from the Sympathy of &s;uperiour and cele&s;tial Virtues ari&s;eth a Drawing, <HI>(attractio)</HI> and conveying <HI>(deductio)</HI> to the Terrene and inferiour Body, al&s;o from Antipathy a Re&s;i&s;tance; <HI>Plato</HI> calls therefore Magick the Attraction or Drawing of one Thing from another, cau&s;ed by an Affinity in Nature.</P>
<P>Now all the Parts of this World, or all the Members of one Animal, depending from one Au|thor and Principle, are joyned together by one and the &s;ame Nature. In us, the Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver and the Re&s;t draw &s;omething from one ano|ther,
<PB N="10" REF="9">and mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t one another; al&s;o that if one of them &s;uffereth, the Others are likewi&s;e &s;uf|fering or compati&s;ing. The &s;ame it is in re&s;pect of all the Bodies in this World joined together; they likewi&s;e &s;erve and are &s;erved mutually by one another; and from this common Alliance, or Affi|nity, ari&s;eth a common Love, and from this com|mon Love a common Attraction or Drawing. This is the Rea&s;on, that the Load&s;tone draws Iron unto it, and the Sun many Flowers: This is the Rea&s;on that <HI>Heliotropium</HI> turneth with the Sun both at Ri&s;ing and going down, and <HI>Selinetropium</HI> with the Moon.</P>
<P>We ought to con&s;ider Sun, Moon and the re&s;t ac|cording to the terrene Quality; and Stones, Vege|tables and Animals according to the cele&s;tial Quali|ty; and &s;o we will find, that what is above, hath Connexion with what is below, and what is below, with what is above. For, by the fatal Law given by our Creator, the terrene Body is to &s;erve the cele&s;tial; and as every individual Part of the fir&s;t is endued with a Matrix adapted to bring forth its like, &s;o the la&s;t is appointed to animate it continually with a cer|tain Sub&s;tance, which is able to cau&s;e its engendering and begetting without Intermi&s;&s;ion. The Sympathy and Antipathy, &s;o notable in Animals, Minerals and Vegetables, is therefore to nothing el&s;e to be a&s;cri|bed, than to the Influence of the cele&s;tial Bodies; and their Impre&s;&s;ion according to the Con&s;titution of each Species and individual Being, either in general or &s;ometimes according to the &s;ingular Fabrick of one Species in particular. Al&s;o a Saphire, to &s;peak generally, is no where offen&s;ive to the Eyes; but neverthele&s;s there hath been found one who did &s;trike the Sight of the Eye by the fir&s;t Applicati|on.</P>
<P>But by what Means &s;ome natural Things join to|gether is very difficult to demon&s;trate out of com|mon
<PB N="11" REF="10">Philo&s;ophy. Becau&s;e what is joyned or coupled to a Thing, is of the &s;ame Being or E&s;&s;ence, or is of the Quality of this Being; or is in it, as the Form is in the Subject, or appertains to it or toucheth it either like a Thing tran&s;muting, in re&s;pect to what is tran&s;muted, or like Art in re&s;pect of the Subject Matter. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;eems to have clearly expounded to us five Things fa&s;ten'd or knit together; Heaven and Earth, Earth and Voidne&s;s, a bottomle&s;s Gulph and Darkne&s;s, the Spirit of God and the Waters, Light and Bodies. The fir&s;t Way of this Connex|ion is &s;ignified by the Earth empty and void. For an empty and void Earth is its Matter before it is &s;upply'd with a Form from el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Way of Connexion is &s;ignified by Darkne&s;s all over the Face of the bottomle&s;s Gulph.</P>
<P>The third by Light &s;pringing up, ri&s;ing, or com|ing upon the Bodies.</P>
<P>The fourth, by Heaven and Earth; the one be|ing joined to the other, as Actives to Pa&s;&s;ives, or as a Thing tran&s;muting, to what is to be tran&s;muted.</P>
<P>The fifth, by the Spirit of the Lord.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee, how this is in us. Earth is a ter|rene Body, empty of Life, void of Sen&s;e; above it are Darkne&s;s, Dulne&s;s, Death, Stupidity, and no Feeling.</P>
<P>Light is Life, which quickeneth, moveth, &s;tirreth, and giveth Sen&s;e to it.</P>
<P>Heaven is the Soul and the Spring of this Light.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God is the Under&s;tanding, the Brightne&s;s of the divine Countenance. The Rea&s;on of this Joyning, or Connexion is this: The Body is void in it&s;elf, hath its Darkne&s;s; then it is joined to Light, through Light to Heaven, through Hea|ven to a &s;piritual Sub&s;tance, as appears by the fol|lowing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>The bottomle&s;s Gulph,</L>
<L>Darkne&s;s,</L>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<L>Void of Life. Earth. Void of Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>Light, Quickening and giving Life.</L>
<L>Heaven, the Spring of Light,</L>
<L>The Spirit.</L></Q>
<P>Here we &s;ee in what Order Things created are knit together. Here we &s;ee the Bond and Knot of the Natural Benevolence. But what Philo&s;ophy is this you will &s;ay? Certainly not a vulgar one, which judgeth of Things by Sen&s;e, Matter and manife&s;t Qualities; but a heavenly, more &s;ubtile and an ab|&s;tra&s;e one.</P>
<P>Body and Soul being Sub&s;tances very far di&s;tant from one another, there was need of a mean Bond to join the&s;e di&s;tant Sub&s;tances together, and to this Purpo&s;e is that thin and &s;piritual &s;mall Body ap|pointed, which Phy&s;icians, as well as Philo&s;ophers, call Spirit. This copulating Spirit is more excellent than the Elements, and even an&s;wers to Heaven. <HI>Ari&s;toteles</HI> &s;peaks of this Proportion thus: Like as all the Virtue of the Heavens is conveyed to the Earth by the Vehicle of Light; al&s;o all the Facul|ties of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> Life, Motion and Sen&s;es are, by the Help of this bright Spirit, convey'd and transferr'd to the terrene Body. That all what I have &s;aid, may be more convincing, I &s;hall produce &s;ome memorable Examples of <HI>Antipathys</HI> and <HI>Sym|pathys,</HI> which Authors of no little Authority have left to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all we meet with a notable Antipathy in Poi&s;ons; not every Antidote re&s;i&s;ts all Sorts of Poi&s;on, according to <HI>Galen.</HI>&mdash;<HI>de Antid.</HI> Each Kind of Poi&s;on hath its particular Antidote.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scythians</HI> were u&s;ed to be&s;mear their Arrows, and Sabres, with a certain Poi&s;on compos'd of hu|man Blood, and a Matter coming out of Putrefac|tion; corrupt and filthy Blood of Vipers; a &s;light
<PB N="13" REF="12">Wound with an In&s;trument al&s;o prepared was dead|ly, and nothing could help but <HI>Cantharides,</HI> which, again&s;t all other Poi&s;ons is ineffectual, according to <HI>Galen</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;corides.</HI></P>
<P>According to <HI>Pliny,</HI> there is no greater Poi&s;on for Trees than wild <HI>Par&s;nip,</HI> becau&s;e, being near them, it taketh not only all the Sub&s;tance away, but it boreth and pierceth Holes, like as with a Sword, through the very Roots of the Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Galen,</HI> I. de Theriaca ad <HI>Pi&s;on.</HI> affirms, that a Herb call'd <HI>Trifoly</HI> boiled and applied to Bitings of Vipers, is to take immediately away all Pains; but if apply'd on &s;ound People, that it cau&s;eth the &s;ame Pains People &s;uffer being bit by Vipers. <HI>Scaliger</HI> endeavours to give a Rea&s;on of this My&s;tery, but it is more according to the Subtilty of his Genius than a true one. So much of Poi&s;ons.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay of the invincible Hardne&s;s of a Diamond, which contemptibly with&s;tands the two greate&s;t; Forces in Nature; and, notwith&s;tand|ing, yields to Goat's Blood, being &s;teep'd therein when it is fre&s;h and warm?</P>
<P>Is not this a &s;urprizing Example of a natural Va|riance or Di&s;cord? By what Ingenuity hath this been found out? By what Accident, or what Con|jecture was there only to experiment &s;uch an im|men&s;e Secret, chiefly in a Goat, the filthie&s;t of all Animals?</P>
<P>A Lion, feared by all Animals, and who careth neither Tyger nor Bear, is, notwith&s;tanding a&s;toni&s;h|ed at the Sight of a far weaker Animal, a Cock. Do you a&s;k the Rea&s;on thereof? Perhaps there is a certain Strength in the Eyes of a Cock, as &s;ome think, repugnant to the Eyes of a Lion. Certainly we cannot look for the Rea&s;on of it in the Matter or Sen&s;es, otherwi&s;e we would fall into endle&s;s Per|plexities; but we mu&s;t look for it in the Contem|plation of Things above us. I remit my Readers to
<PB N="14" REF="13"><HI>Proclus</HI> in his Book of <HI>Magicks,</HI> where he giveth a Rea&s;on, <HI>ex profe&s;&s;o,</HI> of this &s;eeming Prodigy.</P>
<P>Who knows not the Di&s;cord between a Spider and a Toad or Serpent? The fir&s;t, perceiving one of the la&s;t under the Shade of a Tree, after having it artfully entangled in its Web, pierceth its Brains with &s;uch a Force, that it is no more able to di&s;entangle it&s;elf from its Pri&s;on; nor dothit find an End thereof till it is dead.</P>
<P>The Antipathy between an A&s;h-Tree and a Ser|pent, hath been &s;o much experimented, that we know from thence, that a Serpent will always &s;hun, even the Morning and Evening Shade of this Tree, and fly from it &s;o far, that a Fire being made on one Side, and on the other a Semi-Circle of Leaves and Branches of an A&s;h-Tree, it rather will jump, and endeavour to e&s;cape through the Fire, than pa&s;s the A&s;h-Tree.</P>
<P>I proceed to Vegetables, where equally we meet with an evident and notable Di&s;cord. For an Oak-Tree will not pro&s;per in Places where Olives grow; and an Olive-Tree leaveth in Groves of Oaks, &s;uch offen&s;ive Roots, which actually do kill the Oak-Trees. The &s;ame being planted near Wallnut-Trees, either dieth it&s;elf or remains always weak, or cau&s;eth the &s;ame Effects in the Wallnut.</P>
<P>The Hatred between Colewort or Cabbage and Vines, is more vi&s;ible. For a Vine with its crooked Tendrels doth tye and bind it&s;elf to every Thing that it doth catch, only it refu&s;eth the &s;ame to Cab|bage, and being near it, it bends to the oppo&s;ite Side. Colewort or Cabbage being boiling, if only a few Drops of Wine are pour'd upon it, will imme|diately cea&s;e to boil, and the Cabbage will lo&s;e its Colour. The &s;ame will dry through and through, if <HI>Cy|clamen,</HI> a Kind of Briony or Origan, or wild Marjorum is near it; and Vines will become wor&s;e in the Neighbourhood of Bay-Trees.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>There is &s;uch an Antipathy between a Crab and Polypody, that this Herb being apply'd, will cau&s;e its throwing off the Shell wherewith it is covered, or at lea&s;t its Claws.

<P><HI>Homer, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> do report, that Aly&s;&s;on, St. John's Wort and Rue, or Herbgrace, are of &s;uch a natural Repugnancy again&s;t malignant Spirits, that like Heads of Wolves affixed to Gates, &s;o the&s;e Herbs hang'd up in Hou&s;es, do &s;ecure Men and Bea&s;ts again&s;t all kinds of Sorcery or Poi&s;on. <HI>Homer,</HI> who by his Travels got a great Skill in Magicks, relateth, that <HI>Mercurius</HI> arm'd <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> again&s;t the Inchantments of <HI>Circe</HI> by the u&s;e of Rue or Herbgrace. And in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Toby,</HI> deli|ver'd to us by Sacred Writ, we find, that the An|gel taught <HI>Toby</HI> to take Part of the Heart of a Fi&s;h drawn out of the River, and to ca&s;t it upon Coals; the Smoke of which was to rid Men and Women of all kinds of Demons. We ought therefore not to call in Que&s;tion the like Amulets, grounded on na|tural Rea&s;ons, &s;ince a certain Sub&s;tance is i&s;&s;uing out from them, which according to Experience is capable effectually to repair the Strength of Bodies, and to re&s;i&s;t Poi&s;ons or any thing el&s;e that is offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE Root of white Peony, and the Hoof of an Elk, are of an Antipathy again&s;t the Falling Sickne&s;s; the Seed of Melanthium, again&s;t Rheums or falling down of raw Humours; Wolf's Dung again&s;t Colicks; not by virtue of Charms, as &s;ome very ignorantly think, but becau&s;e &s;ome Vapours like Atoms i&s;&s;ue from their Sub&s;tance, which &s;ent forth to the Brain, do dry it, and alter the Cau&s;e of the Sickne&s;s by their own Virtue. <HI>Galen,</HI> after many

<P>The Hand of a Fi&s;herman is &s;tupify'd, as &s;oon as he toucheth a Fi&s;h call'd the <HI>Cramp Fi&s;h,</HI> though it be with a long Pole. A little Fi&s;h, half a Foot in length, call'd a <HI>Suck&s;tone</HI> or <HI>Sea Lamprey,</HI> cleav|ing to the Keel of a Ship, hindreth the Cour&s;e there|of, though Wind and Weather is favourable. This is not done by virtue of Charms, but by Rea&s;ons I have ju&s;t now mention'd. It is certainly a &s;tupen|dous Miracle of Nature, that &s;uch a &s;mall Fi&s;h is capable to &s;tay a like Bulk, and to hinder the Cour&s;e of a great Ship, though in full Sail, by no other means, than by cleaving to it.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> reports, that the imperial Ship, wherein <HI>Antony</HI> did intend to circuit and to exhort his Peo|ple, was &s;tay'd by &s;uch a Fi&s;h; and that he was oblig'd to go into another Ship, mean while that his Fleet was driven a great way off. <HI>Caius</HI>'s Gally bound for <HI>Antium,</HI> an ancient City in <HI>Italy,</HI> and rowed by four hundred Hands, had the &s;ame Fate; and it &s;eems this Fi&s;h to be ominous, &s;ince this Prince, &s;oon after his coming back, was deadly wounded. There was no longer Room to dive into the rea&s;on of this Staying, as &s;oon as this Fi&s;h was found cleaving to the Stern of the Ship. But being brought into the Ship, it proceeded; and it is par|ticularly to be admir'd, why it was able to &s;tay the Ship by cleaving to it, and could not do the &s;ame after being brought into the Ship. We mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that Nature here is intricate, and cannot be under&s;tood by our Sen&s;es. For be&s;ides what I have &s;aid, it &s;eems as if &s;he knowing of an approaching Danger did intend to remove it. The Ship wherein the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Periander</HI> were &s;ent, for
<PB N="17" REF="16">having the noble Boys gelded, was &s;tay'd in its Cour&s;e; as if Nature did judge it dete&s;table to rob Men of what is given them to their Pre&s;ervation. The Ship of <HI>Caius Cae&s;ar,</HI> not long after a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|ted at <HI>Rome,</HI> was &s;tay'd, as if Nature commi&s;erating <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Fate, would keep him back from this Mi&s;|fortune, and hinder his unhappy Cour&s;e.

<P>Every Day we meet with a notable Concord be|tween Herbs and the cele&s;tial Bodies. We are a&s;&s;ur'd of the &s;olar Pre&s;ence by the Flowers of an Herb call'd <HI>Cichoreum, Succory,</HI> which at the Ri&s;ing of the Sun openeth, and at its Setting clo&s;eth it&s;elf up again.</P>

It would be in vain to &s;eek for the Cau&s;e thereof in the manife&s;t Qualities.</P>
<P>The Sympathy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Stones and the cele&s;tial Bodies is &s;till greater: Their Power is more exten&s;ive than that of Herbs; becau&s;e they &s;eem not only to command the cele&s;tial Bodies, but al&s;o Men.

<P><HI>Siderites,</HI> a Stone like Iron, hath Power to cau&s;e Variance among&s;t Men. No doubt, the&s;e Stones do actually &s;pout or drive out an invi&s;ible hidden Power. And though they are &s;olid Things, never|thele&s;s the native Heat and Rubbing and Touching draws out a Virtue, which it communicateth to the Heart and Brains. There are Medicines of a great U&s;e by Rea&s;on of their Re&s;emblance, we &s;ee them daily prevail again&s;t many Di&s;ea&s;es for no other Rea&s;on but becau&s;e the have one another's Anatomy and <HI>Signatura.</HI> This is a Way of making Demon|&s;trations by Re&s;emblance, by which the Creator of all Things oftentimes di&s;covereth &s;ublime and hidden Things to in&s;truct us by the Idea of their Re&s;em|blance to what they have been from the Beginning de&s;tinated.</P>
<P>All Herbs, Flowers, Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are magical Signs granted by their Author, the Knowledge Whereof brings us to the true Phy&s;ick, <HI>i. e.</HI> Signa|tum; becau&s;e the Signs externally di&s;cover'd by Nature, are Tokens of certain internally hidden Vir|tues;
<PB N="22" REF="21">and that Signatum, and the inward Kernel, is always &s;ignify'd by the outward Phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on, that many Di&s;ea&s;es cannot be cur'd with every Remedy? Becau&s;e they proceed from an a&s;tral Impre&s;&s;ion of the Firmament, there is need of an a&s;tronomical Influence; that is to &s;ay, of Things which have an Analogy between the great and le&s;&s;er World: Herein doth con&s;i&s;t the true mag|netical Virtue of the Firmament, and the Means to re&s;i&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es cau&s;ed by &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions. This Influence and Signatura we ob&s;erve in &s;ome Plants; the notable&s;t and mo&s;t evident do appear in Hyperi|con and Per&s;icaria; the fir&s;t is pierc'd or bor'd with &s;mall Holes, and the other &s;potted with red Spots, as if Blood had dropp'd upon it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Signaturae, &s;o very u&s;eful to the Judg|ment of Di&s;ea&s;es, are likewi&s;e to be met with in other Vegetables; and it is not &s;ufficient for a <HI>Bota|nicus</HI> to &s;earch into the external Signaturae of Plants, their Time and Place of growing; but he ought al&s;o to concern him&s;elf about the inward Principle, and their Virtue, which is the Image of God implanted in Things created. This Principle is known by many Names; &s;ome call it the <HI>Bal&s;am of Nature, vital Sulphur, radical Seed, fir&s;t Matter;</HI> &s;ome <HI>natu|ral Heat, Mercury of Life, univer&s;al Spirit.</HI> It ne|ver is de&s;troy'd in the Corruption of Things; the Elements and all mix'd Bodies being di&s;&s;olv'd, it will neverthele&s;s remain. This Bal&s;am doth occupy the whole Anatomy of Bodies in living Creatures and Plants; in &s;ome Animals rather a certain Part, as the Heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and according to the Diver&s;ity of Impre&s;&s;ions, Tincture, Abundance of Humours, Quality, and Difference, it produceth different and divers Actions. By virtue of this Bal&s;am &s;ome Plants and Parts of Animals are of an Antipathy again&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es; and by the Virtue and Power of this Bal|&s;am &s;ome Parts of Animals are of a Sympathy with
<PB N="23" REF="22">&s;ome Parts of the human Body, aiding, &s;trengthen|ing, and pre&s;erving it in its radical Vigour.</P>
<P>Who neglects this Principle, the Signature of Things, without overcoming a thorough Knowledge thereof, is unworthy of the Name of a Phy&s;ician. If there were nothing el&s;e, the Knowledge of this My&s;tery would make a Phy&s;ician excel in his Art, according to what <HI>Hippocrates</HI> &s;ays of tho&s;e, who know before-hand which can be cured, and which mu&s;t die.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, that every Di&s;ea&s;e hath its particular Signs, procuring the Knowledge thereof to us; and the &s;ame Signs are to be found in the Re|medies al&s;o mark'd by Nature. We may therefore &s;ay in general, and with a great deal of Truth, that this Di&s;ea&s;e is a Di&s;ea&s;e for this Remedy, and this Remedy is a Remedy for this Di&s;ea&s;e. The Herb <HI>Tu&s;&s;ilago</HI> is a Remedy for ob&s;tructed Lungs, becau&s;e it weareth the &s;ame Mark. The Herbs <HI>Lingua Cer|vina</HI> and <HI>Scolopendrium</HI> are a Remedy again&s;t a puff'd-up or &s;wollen Milt, becau&s;e they repre&s;ent the Figure of the Milt. The maketh appear, that it is po&s;&s;ible to overcome a Knowledge of Nature by the Signs of the Remedies; and that the My&s;tery of Sympathies and Antipathies, in re&s;pect of Things, as well as their Qualities, are of a va&s;t Benefit for a Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The&s;e who are &s;kilful in this &s;ecret Philo&s;ophy, and have watch'd Opportunities to experience Na|ture's Strength, are capable of producing many wonderful Effects: And as the Way of their Pro|ceedings, as in many other Things, is hidden and conceal'd, the un&s;kilful not &s;eldom a&s;cribe the Cau&s;e of their Actions to the Delu&s;ions of Daemons; that is to &s;ay, to Magick call'd <HI>Go&euml;tia,</HI> from Mourning; becau&s;e it is an Invocation of evil Spirits near Tombs, and German-&s;i&s;ters to Necromancy, which, for call|ing the Souls of the Dead, requireth the Effu&s;ion of
<PB N="24" REF="23">humane or &s;ome other Blood of black Cattle, where|with Daemons are delighted.</P>
<P>True Magick, grounded upon natural Cau&s;es, is nothing el&s;e but a thorough Knowledge of the Con|cord or Di&s;cord between Stones, Herbs, Minerals, Animals, and the Stars, which, exactly to learn, re|quireth a great deal of Wi&s;dom, and is in no way contrary to divine Laws.</P>
<P>This natural Magick hath always been honour'd and approv'd of by diligent Searchers in the cele&s;tial and &s;ublunar Beings, as tending to the Admiration of the Works of God. Who is diving therein, can|not but overcome a Knowledge of an infinite Num|ber of Things, impo&s;&s;ible to be under&s;tood by any other Means.</P>
<P>It will add a great deal of Light to the further Unfolding of our My&s;tery, to make mention in this Place of &s;ome Experiments made with Rings of Gold, Silver, Latten, or any other Metal dedicated to ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ial Bodies, who&s;e Virtue one intends to pro|cure to him&s;elf. I &s;ay of Rings, in who&s;e Cavity is fa&s;ten'd a Stone, and under it an Herb of a Sympa|thy with the &s;ame Star. <HI>Trallianus, Gordonius, Me&s;ue,</HI> and many others, do report, that the Virtue thereof is to rejoice the Heart, and to expel Di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Gyges,</HI> a King of <HI>Lydia,</HI> got a Stone, taken out of the Head of a Dragon, inclos'd in his Ring, which when he turn'd to the Palm of his Hand, he could be &s;een of none; but he him&s;elf could &s;ee every one; whence the Proverb, <HI>Gygis annulus:</HI> By the Help of this Ring, it is &s;aid, he flew <HI>Candaules,</HI> and committed Adultery with his Wife. <HI>Alexander Trallianus</HI> tells us, that the Image of <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;trangling a Lyon, &s;et in a Ring, cureth the Cholick. The Philo&s;opher <HI>Eudaemus</HI> is &s;aid to have prepar'd Rings again&s;t Stingings of Serpents, Charms, and Di&s;ea&s;es. <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> in his <HI>Antiquities,</HI> reports to
<PB N="25" REF="24">have &s;een, in the Pre&s;ence of the Emperor <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ia|nus,</HI> one <HI>Eleazar,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> apply to the No&s;e of one po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Daemon a Ring, under the Seal of which was laid a Root found by <HI>Solomon;</HI> and that this <HI>Eleazar</HI> did draw out of the No&s;e the Daemon, who immediately falling on the Ground, was bani&s;h'd by him, upon reciting <HI>Solomon</HI>'s conjuring Hymn again&s;t Daemons. The &s;ame doth tell us, that <HI>Solomon</HI> hath been very &s;kilful in Magicks: And that <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Lawgiver of the <HI>Jews,</HI> did begin to learn Magicks in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where he made Rings of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Forgetfulne&s;s:</HI> The Ring of <HI>Forgetfulne&s;s</HI> he gave to the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Women to forget him, which cau&s;ed his free returning from <HI>Egypt.</HI> This was not per|form'd by the Help of prohibited Magick, as <HI>Apol|lonius</HI> and <HI>Ly&s;imachus</HI> have tax'd <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with, and therefore been refuted by the &s;aid <HI>Jo&s;ephus;</HI> but by the Help of a thorough Knowledge of the cele&s;tial and &s;ublunar Beings, their De&s;tination and Virtues. And it is known, that <HI>Empedocles, Pythagoras, De|mocritus,</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI> him&s;elf, learn'd Magicks from the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is therefore not generous, to call intirely in que&s;tion all Cures perform'd by Characters, graven Images tied to the Neck, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e their Opera|tion is natural, and perform'd by the wonderful In|fluence of the cele&s;tial Bodies agreeing with our Bo|dies. It is not rea&s;onable intirely to deny Credit to what our Ance&s;tors, diligent Searchers in <HI>Nature</HI>'s Clo&s;et, have left to Po&s;terity, in re&s;pect of Charac|ters and Seals, wrought at certain times, according to the Virtue and Influence of the Bodies above us, without any Super&s;tition, (which is fram'd only by the Ignorance of this My&s;tery) without any Profa|nation, or Offence to the Name of God, and with|out any Violation of Faith or Religion. That this u&s;eful Knowledge hath in After-times been &s;o very much hidden, and &s;eems at this Day almo&s;t intirely
<PB N="26" REF="25">lo&s;t, can be a&s;crib'd to no other Rea&s;on but to the Mi&s;u&s;e of the&s;e characters. Men falling to Super|&s;tition, and not under&s;tanding the Rea&s;on of their Working, did attribute more to them than our Creator had granted, and intended to di&s;cover there|by. I am very far off to attribute to the&s;e Images a Virtue in them&s;elves; nor do I affirm, that Cha|racters or Names, graven under Con&s;tellations, have a Virtue by rea&s;on of the Figure; becau&s;e the Figure, Number, Bigne&s;s, Situation, and the Solution of what is continual, are no Principles of Actions. I would intirely deny their Virtue, in ca&s;e there were nothing el&s;e acting or moving, by who&s;e Authority Characters are powerful. I have been oblig'd to in|large upon this Subject for Rea&s;on to make appear what is true, it being the Perfection of our Under|&s;tanding; and to &s;hew what Difference there is be|tween true and phy&s;ical Signaturae, and &s;uper&s;titious and unlawful ones, which, for Contemplation-&s;ake, we may know, but no-where but in Practice. There is no Virtue in Heaven and Earth, which hath not its Offspring from God: Al&s;o Medicines are vi&s;ible to the Body, Words invi&s;ible to the Body; now if Herbs or Words are curing, the Cau&s;e is notwith|&s;tanding in God; therefore the Herb it&s;elf is not the Medicine, but it is hidden in it invi&s;ibly by God. It &s;hews a great deal of Ignorance to condemn, or to deride things remote or di&s;tant from our Sen&s;es, and not fit to be comprehended by them. Who is not a&s;toni&s;h'd at the wonderful Effects of precious Stones? Neverthele&s;s we cannot deny, that there is a great natural Power in them, chiefly when under certain Con&s;tellations certain Figures and Signatures are graved therein. It is fal&s;e what &s;ome report, that the Effects of precious Stones are produced by a magical Virtue, and not by a natural one: It pro|ceeds from the School of Magicians, who u&s;ed pre|cious Stones, graven under certain Con&s;tellations,
<PB N="27" REF="26">for a Pretext of their Inchantments. It is &s;ufficient|ly known, that an Emerald gets loo&s;e from the Finger at the Death of the Per&s;on it is worn by; and that a Stone, which comes from <HI>New Spain,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Lapis Nephriticus,</HI> is of great Efficacy again&s;t the Stone in the Kidneys, if but bound to one's Arm. Who does not admire the Virtues of a <HI>Turquois?</HI> and an infinite Number of Experiments made with precious Stones, as well as Herbs, could be quoted; which if they do not every-where, and not always an&s;wer, neverthele&s;s do not de&s;erve to be call'd in que&s;tion; becau&s;e not every thing doth every-where and always concur, and the Rarity or Singularity of Effects doth never take away the Cau&s;e in Nature; for wonderful Things in Nature are perform'd by a due Applica|tion of Actives to Pa&s;&s;ives hereunto di&s;pos'd &s;o clo&s;ely and &s;o &s;ecretly, that the Cau&s;e thereof &s;eems exceedingly remote or di&s;tant. It is outragious to a&s;cribe every thing immediately to the Works of <HI>Beel|zebub,</HI> which are remote from our Sen&s;es, as if a hidden Virtue in Nature, the In&s;trument of the Di|vine Power, was not able to produce many wonder|ful Things without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Prince of evil Spirits. It is likewi&s;e outragious in &s;uch, who intirely given to Super&s;tition, either out of Igno|rance, or out of a fooli&s;h Doubtfulne&s;s, maintain the mo&s;t evident Things to proceed from hidden Cau&s;es, who, be&s;ides the Colour and Ta&s;te, a&s;cribe no other Virtues to Plants; as if a particular Concord or Agreement between them and &s;omething above us, was not capable to produce, be&s;ides their fir&s;t &s;en|&s;ual Virtues, &s;ome hidden ones; witne&s;s the daily Experience. I take it, therefore, to be very indi&s;|creet to a&s;&s;ign, in &s;ingular Facts, no other Cau&s;e than what &s;eems to us to be; for who can deny, that either by &s;ome In&s;piration, or by Chance and meer Accidents, Effects are produced &s;emblable to natural
<PB N="28" REF="27">ones? And it is &s;ufficient for one, who under&s;tand|eth or &s;etteth out the Cau&s;es of Things natural, to have &s;hew'd &s;uch a &s;emblable Effect to be the Effect of natural Cau&s;es, either always or for the mo&s;t part, And tho' the Event doth not always an&s;wer, never|thele&s;s the Power and Motion in Nature is not to be denied; becau&s;e all Cau&s;es for producing one Effect do &s;eldom concur, which is to be &s;een in Things, which, for rea&s;on of their Fewne&s;s, Variety, and Singularity, are con&s;ider'd as Miracles and Prodigies; for the&s;e Things have natural Cau&s;es, but they are &s;eldom di&s;pos'd or ready for the like Effects. If therefore the Effect is natural, the Cau&s;e mu&s;t be the &s;ame, and al&s;o contrarywi&s;e. Now the Effects of Images, graven under the Con&s;tellation of certain cele&s;tial Bodies, are natural; con&s;equently the Cau&s;e thereof mu&s;t likewi&s;e be natural. And tho' this Cau&s;e is hidden, and hard to be under&s;tood, and very remote from our outward Sen&s;es, neverthele&s;s there is no Occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to a diabolical Power; but we ought attentively to con&s;ider by what Help, and by what Concurrence of Cau&s;es, &s;uch an Effect is produced or not produced; and we ought rather to take an Opportunity from the&s;e mar|vellous Cau&s;es, and the natural Effects produced by them, to acknowledge and to proclaim the wonder|ful Power of God; who having evidently implanted &s;uch marvellous Virtues in Nature, how wonderful mu&s;t He appear in Things intirely hidden from us?</P>

<P>But why and wherefore Rings, Images and Fi|gures graved in certain Metals and Stones have the Virtues I have recited, is a Que&s;tion not to be de|cided
<PB N="46" REF="45">by the Temperament or manife&s;t Qualities, nor is it to be a&s;&s;ign'd to the Sub&s;tance it&s;elf, but to a Heavenly and magical One, that is to &s;ay, to a Superiour and mo re &s;ublime Cau&s;e, which &s;ome not unfitly have call'd a &s;piritual Vehicle and Bond. By the Help of it Body and Soul, Sub&s;tance very di&s;tant and remote from one another, are joyned, and by the Intervention or Interce&s;&s;ion of this Ve|hicle, the Load&s;tone draweth Iron unto it, and <HI>Cichoreum</HI> follows the Motion of the Sun.</P>
<P>Not every Philo&s;ophical Demon&s;tration is to be taken from the Sen&s;es and Qualities. A manife&s;t Proof thereof is in the Colour of a white Ro&s;e; from whence doth its Colour proceed? if you a&s;cribe the Cau&s;e thereof to a colder Temperament, what will you &s;ay of the Red one? A Kind of Intybus giveth a milky Juice, which you a&s;cribe to a cold Quality: but what will you &s;ay of Tithymalus, a Herb call'd Sea|lettice, Wolfes-milk or Milk-thi&s;tle, which giveth likewi&s;e a milky Juice and is hot enough? The Bitterne&s;s of Aloe, you &s;ay, doth proceed becau&s;e it is of a hot Nature; but Opium, which killeth by its pernicious Coldne&s;s, hath likewi&s;e a great Bitter|ne&s;s. It is in vain to a&s;cribe every Thing to the manife&s;t Qualities: <HI>Scalciger</HI> calleth it a great Impu|dence, and &s;hews the In&s;ufficiency of &s;uch Rea&s;ons only in the &s;everal Kinds of Poi&s;ons.</P>
<P>Thus far we have con&s;ider'd the Principles and Cau&s;es of marvelous and hidden Actions in Na|ture; it remains now to make an Application of the&s;e Principles to the Method of Curing Wounds, I am going to publi&s;h.</P>
<P>I believe every Body is convinc'd by what I have &s;aid, that Plants, Roots, Stones, Metals, the Spirit and cele&s;tial Signs, are by a divine Law as it were partaking and con&s;piring together, &s;eemingly for no other Rea&s;on, than as <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays, becau&s;e to each
<PB N="47" REF="46">Species is a peculiar cele&s;tial Sign, like the Pole to the Load&s;tone, by our Creator con&s;ecrated and dedicat|ed; al&s;o that each Plant, each Metal, and each pre|cious Stone is of a Sympathy with a certain Star or cele&s;tial Sign. But the more &s;ublime this Po&s;ition is, the farther we are to go back to the Beginning, and the more diligent Search we are to make therein. We do all agree that Heaven and every Thing hath been immediately created by God, and that every Thing hath received and doth keep its Virtue as well for pre&s;erving it&s;elf, as for bringing forth its like. Becau&s;e God, who ever works by the mo&s;t compendious Way, hath, after having given every Things its particular Virtue, appointed the Heavens for the farther continual Working thereby. Now as the Seed is endued with a vital Power, which prepareth, di&s;po&s;eth and maketh fit the Matter for bringing forth its like, al&s;o, that at all Times it may receive and draw unto it&s;elf that animating and &s;piritual Power from Heaven, which is the very Cau&s;e of the Support of all what is created, we may &s;ay, that the Seed furni&s;heth the Matter, and Hea|ven putteth on the Form. Al&s;o a Man doth beget a Man, the Man by Virtue of the Seed procureth and brings together the Apparel, and is <HI>cau&s;a prox|ima.</HI> The Spirit and the Warmth which is in the Seed, prepareth the Matter of the Seed: fir&s;t it cau&s;eth a Mingling and Tempering together con&s;o|nant to each &s;ignal Part which is to be made there|of; and then it giveth the Structure, Conformity and Po&s;ture; la&s;tly it diffu&s;eth it&s;elf through all the Parts and abideth therein as a Ruler, and refu&s;es to for&s;ake what it hath temper'd, form'd, and com|po&s;ed, the other efficient Cau&s;e of a Man's Being, and indeed the Fir&s;t and Principal one is, which giveth a Species Form or Shape to this &s;ingle prepar'd Matter,
<PB N="48" REF="47">which is Heaven; for the Species of Things are ca&s;t in by Heaven, and not by the Matter it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Sayings of the Antients: <HI>Deum per naturas e&s;&s;e divi&s;um,</HI> and <HI>Deorum plena e&s;&s;e omnia,</HI> are to be under&s;tood, that the Virtue received and infu&s;ed by God remains in every thing; that a godly Virtue is in every thing, by who&s;e Power every thing cometh forth; but otherwi&s;e in Heaven and otherwi&s;e in Things which are not able to bear up them&s;elves; in &s;uch it is more ob&s;cure, but in Heaven more evident and more excellent to the Generation of Things. What therefore God hath created in Hea|ven and Earth, is intirely maintain'd and ruled by him; the cele&s;tial Ones immediately by him&s;elf, and the terre&s;trial Ones by the Subordination of the Heavens appointed for the Procreation and Con&s;er|vation of all &s;ublunary Beings. The Species, Forms or Shapes of all living Creatures, Roots, Stones and Metals, which ever have been or can be, are compa&s;|&s;ed by the Power Heaven is endued with, which be|ing big, as it were, with an innumerable Number of Species or Forms, ingenders every thing; and by this way one Power and Faculty hath in it&s;elf the Vir|tues of all the Bodies below. Heaven therefore pro|duceth without Seed many things, but no Seed is able to bring forth any thing without Heaven; but it being duly prepared and &s;et in Order, Heaven ca&s;ts into it its Species and Perfection, it rai&s;eth up Life in every thing by the Interceding of the Bright univer&s;al Spirit: For this is the Carrier between Heaven and Earth, diffu&s;ed throughout the whole Univer&s;e, who communicateth to all and every thing at one and the &s;ame Time its Species, and na|tive vital Heat accommodated to its Ingendring. It is he, who doth contain every thing, and doth cheri&s;h it with Heat and Life; through his Power and Help Things without Life do &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and animate Things
<PB N="49" REF="48">have a Soul according to each Kind, a nouri&s;hing one, &s;ome have a &s;en&s;ual one, and &s;ome a Soul en|dued with or partaking of Rea&s;on. But this Power de&s;cending from Heaven, doth accommodate it&s;elf to every thing; it &s;erveth each one with as much as its Nature de&s;ireth, and never giveth more than the Condition of each Subject can bear. Neither is this Virtue always like unto it&s;elf, nor doth it always and in the &s;ame Manner exhibit it&s;elf to every thing, but variou&s;ty according to the Station of the Stars and their different ca&s;ting forth of Beams, who for the mo&s;t Part do vary very much, though this Carrier, I &s;ay, this univer&s;al Spirit, is always the &s;ame and of a not changing Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is therefore not likely, as &s;ome think, that this Spirit of the World can impart to every thing Life and Form, without being in Want of the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the cele&s;tial Bodies, or the Stars; for if this was po&s;&s;ible, he would ingender always the like in one and the &s;ame Way, that is to &s;ay, in the &s;ame Mea&s;ure and perpetually. For he carrieth with him a vital Soul and Nature it&s;elf, and maketh lively all what he entereth, but all this according to the Nature, Condition, Di&s;po&s;ition and Preparation of each Subject.</P>
<P>It being evident by what I have &s;aid, that the cele&s;tial Bodies do concur to the Procreation and Pre&s;ervation of all Things; and that all Parts of the World do cleave or are joyned together, or em|brace one another, by this common Carrier the uni|ver&s;al Spirit, being of a middling Sub&s;tance between Heaven and the &s;ublunar Beings; and that there is no one Thing in the World &s;o abject, upon which this Spirit doth not be&s;tow &s;ome Virtue and Quality, with which it is infu&s;ed by Heaven and the cele&s;tial Bodies; that, as this Spirit meddleth with the bringing forth of all Things, every Thing mu&s;t be
<PB N="50" REF="49">comprehended in it; I &s;ay, as all this is evident by what I have advanced, who can doubt of the Po&s;|&s;ibility of curing Wounds without applying any Remedy, only by anointing the In&s;trument where|with &s;uch a Wound is made? Or, who can deny that &s;uch Cures are natural? Certainly they can be demon&s;trated out of the very Principles of Nature it&s;elf, and who denieth it, is either ignorant thereof, or thinks proper to mea&s;ure every Thing with his Sen&s;es. For the&s;e Cures are performed merely by Nature and a magnetical Power, Drawing <HI>(Attrac|tio)</HI> and Conveying <HI>(Deductio)</HI> the Influence of ce|le&s;tial Bodies working by the Elements; and this &s;o often mentioned Carrier the univer&s;al Spirit, who, as the mean Bond, induceth from proper Con&s;tella|tions a Sympathy, knitting together, or Conveniency, as <HI>Tully</HI> &s;ays, out of which next a healing Virtue is derived to the In&s;trument, from whence afterwards it goeth out, and is continued and conveyed to the wounded Part; la&s;tly, by the Action of this &s;piri|tual Virtue, the Effect en&s;ueth. For between the Wound and the In&s;trument is a magnetical Drawing and Conveying Power <HI>(Attractrix &amp; Deductrix);</HI> the fir&s;t tends to the Part afflicted or the Wound, that is to &s;ay, the Drawing <HI>(Attractio)</HI> goeth to the wounded Part, and the conveying of the Virtue <HI>(Deductio)</HI> to the In&s;trument anointed.</P>
<P>But there is objected, that the Space coming be|tween the Time and Place doth hinder this con|veying or healing, and that nothing can act beyond its limited Space; moreover that it is nece&s;&s;ary the Body to be healed, &s;hould be touch'd by that which is to heal; and properly touching cannot be &s;aid but of Things who&s;e Extremities or Ends meet toge|ther. Now &s;uch a Touching doth not happen between the Wound and the In&s;trument anointed; con&s;equently no Cure can be perform'd.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="50">
<P>Nobody will argue in this Manner but &s;en&s;ual Philo&s;ophers: But it is very ea&s;y to confute their Arguments. Who knows not that many Things act at a Di&s;tance, who&s;e Out&s;ides, or Superficies, can never be joyned, and notwith&s;tanding they meet together, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sun and a Man's Body; though their Superficies can never be joyn'd toge|ther, neverthele&s;s the Beams, being between, actual|ly do join them; for no natural Actives can act <HI>in extremum</HI> before acting <HI>in medium,</HI> becau&s;e every phy&s;ical or natural Action is performed by Touch|ing. The Sun warmeth the inferior World by the Orb of the Moon, though it never toucheth it, nor warmeth the Sphere of the Moon. Al&s;o all Bodies, between which is a Sympathy or Antipa|thy, mutually affect one another, and work upon one another without any vi&s;ible Touching, that is to &s;ay, the Virtue of one is carried to the other by the Intervention or Interce&s;&s;ion of the univer&s;al Spi|rit; al&s;o, that though the Space is very great, this Virtue is neverthele&s;s not alter'd nor di&s;pers'd by Winds, nor di&s;&s;olved by a cold and moi&s;t Air, but by Rea&s;on of its natural Communion, Accord and Bond, pre&s;erved and continued.</P>
<P>Al&s;o in Contagions, Bodies do not touch one another; and, in pe&s;tilential Fevers, many are in|fected who never come near &s;ick People, that is to &s;ay, their extreme Parts do not meet: For the ma|lignant and corrupt Quality of the&s;e Fevers defileth the Bodies by propagating and diffu&s;ing it&s;elf and continuing. Therefore who communicateth to ano|ther a Di&s;ea&s;e, needs not to touch him, but the corrupt Breath or Vapours may be &s;ent and hidden in Garments and other Things, (witne&s;s the daily Experience,) and infect another many Days after; and though we cannot properly &s;ay, that &s;uch an infected one hath been touched by another, never|thele&s;s
<PB N="52" REF="51">we can without Doubt affirm, that no Di&s;ea&s;e can be communicated from one to another without a Body, that is to &s;ay, they cannot be carried or con|veyed without the Intervention of a &s;piritual Sub|&s;tance or Humour. It is therefore undeniable, that there are many Actions performed without a vi&s;ible Touching, and that many Bodies act upon one ano|ther mutually, without meeting together by the Touching of their Bodies, but of their Virtues; and this Virtue which Bodies make u&s;e of and put forth at a Di&s;tance, is a Quality without a Body, wherein the whole Power lieth. Al&s;o the Power i&s;&s;uing from this Ointment doth not &s;pread it&s;elf out in the Stone, in Iron or Wood, with which it hath no Affinity, but propagateth it&s;elf to the Wound by Virtue of its Mover.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing which moveth in this Ointment, is the Bal&s;amic Power hidden in the Blood and in the Mo&s;s, which, by the Intervention of the &s;piri|tual Bond, is continued to the Wound, and except the Di&s;tance is too great, becometh one and the &s;ame with it by joining both Forms. I &s;ay, they join, becau&s;e their Forms do extend them&s;elves, and mutually meeting they unite together. Both what moveth and what is moved, becometh one, either by an immediate Application and Joyning of both Superficies, or the Virtue of one is conveyed to the Superficies, con&s;equently to the Body of the other; let it be done by Light, Beams or any other hidden Quality and &s;piritual Touching. Therefore this Ointment reacheth the Wound, or is joined to the Wound as an efficient Power, or as Actives to Pa&s;&s;ives; or as a Thing tran&s;muting or altering to a Body to be tran&s;muted: In the &s;ame manner Heaven is joyned to Earth, which neverthele&s;s according to its Super|ficies is not contiguous with it, that is to &s;ay, the
<PB N="53" REF="52">Extremities of Heaven and Earth do not touch one another.</P>
<P>The vulgar phy&s;ical Canons are therefore not to be under&s;tood without Exceptions, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Extremities of Actives and Pa&s;&s;ives do always touch one another; and that Actives have no Power upon Pa&s;&s;ives, except their &s;uperficial Out&s;ides or Extre|mities touch together. For the Quality, or the cele&s;tial and magnetical Virtue by the Help of this conveying Spirit, is in the Ointment, the Cau&s;e, and as it were the Vehicle, which being moved, the Thing to be carried is likewi&s;e moved. In the Ve|hicle is required, that it may be apt for carrying, and for carrying is nothing more apt than the cele&s;tial magnetical Virtue; which, as it were, intercedeth be|tween the In&s;trument and the wounded Place, mo|ving and directing every Thing for obtaining the de&s;ir'd Effect. For between this Virtue and Vehicle is fir&s;t of all a Sympathy, which afterwards is conveyed to the In&s;trument; from thence to the Wound by Rea&s;on of the Familiarity and Similitude; for this is the effici|ent Cau&s;e, why Things are wrapp'd and ty'd together. Therefore nobody can deny, that there is a Touch|ing between the In&s;trument and the Wound, though it is not performed immediately by joyning the Ex|tremities together, becau&s;e there is no Nece&s;&s;ity for it in this My&s;tery. The Principles which are acting in this Ca&s;e not being corporeal, there is likewi&s;e no corporeal Touching required. The Virtue is brought to the Wound mediately by interceding (as I have often repeated) of a more &s;ublime and incor|poreal Power, which the Doctors of natural Ma|gicks have called a magnetical one.</P>
<P>It remains nothing but to give a De&s;cription of the Ointment wherewith magnetical Cures of Wounds without Pains, and without an immediate Applica|tion of any Remedy, are performed. <HI>Bapti&s;ta Por|ta</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="53">giveth a De&s;cription of &s;ome &s;uch Compo&s;ition, and introduceth <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> for its Author: But this Compo&s;ition is very defective, as every body may &s;ee by comparing it to the following. Be|&s;ides, it hath been contradicted by many, that <HI>Pa|racel&s;us</HI> could be the Author thereof, which joyn'd to the Credulity wherewith the &s;aid <HI>Porta</HI> hath col|lected and publi&s;hed a great many Compo&s;itions, no|thing at all to be depended upon, giveth Room to believe, that he was unable to a&s;&s;ure the Veracity of his De&s;cription by any other means than by intro|ducing <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> for its Author. I believe there|fore the following De&s;cription will be the more ac|ceptable, as by long Experience of different Per&s;ons it hath been found to an&s;wer the End for which it is de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>The De&s;cription is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Sanicle (Lat. Sanicula)</HI> which is &s;potted, and hath the Signature of the Lungs.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Bugle (Lat. Con&s;olida media, Buglum, Bugla, Bugula)</HI> both being gathered fre&s;h, and dryed in the Shade, and afterwards made to Powder; you take of each one Ounce.</P>
<P>Oil of Lin&s;eed.</P>
<P>Turpentine.</P>
<P>Armeniac Bolus, of each two Drachms.</P>
<P>Human Fat, four Ounces.</P>
<P>Genuine Mummy.</P>
<P>Human Blood, being yet warm.</P>
<P>Of the Mo&s;s which groweth upon the Skull of a Man, being hanged and left hanging; of each one Ounce.</P>
<P>All being well mixed in a Mortar, mu&s;t be kept clo&s;e in a Gla&s;s or earthen Ve&s;&s;el with a narrow Neck, being glazed within.</P>
<P>The whole is to be made when the Sun doth exi&s;t in <HI>Libra;</HI> but the Mo&s;s is to be gathered when the
<PB N="55" REF="54">Moon increa&s;eth and doth exi&s;t in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Venus</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, not in <HI>Saturn</HI> or <HI>Mars.</HI> If you cannot expect the Moon's exi&s;ting in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Venus,</HI> you are diligently to ob&s;erve when <HI>Luna</HI> is in the Sign of <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> to gather the Mo&s;s at that time, becau&s;e this Sign is the mo&s;t conveniente&s;t by rea&s;on of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Dwelling Place, and <HI>Venus</HI>'s Ex|altation; the next after it is <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Libra.</HI></P>
<P>By this Ointment al&s;o prepared, all manner of Wounds given by In&s;truments, either pierced, or &s;tricken, or blown, are cured, if only the In&s;trument can be had; but &s;uch Wounds are excepted where the Arteries or &s;ome of the principal Members, as the Heart, Brains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are hurted.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument with which the Wound is made, or in want thereof, a piece of Wood or a little Bough of Willow, &s;teeped in the bloody Opening, is to be plunged in the Ointment and therein to be left: The wounded Per&s;on, meanwhile, hath only to wa&s;h the Wound daily once with his Urine or fre&s;h Water, and to cover it with a piece of clean Linen, always wiping away the Filth, and the Wound will heal and con|&s;olidate without any Pains. If the In&s;trument where|with the Wound is made cannot be had, another In|&s;trument is to be &s;teeped in the Wound, and after it is anointed on both Sides with this In&s;trument, it is to be kept in a clean and temperate Place, becau&s;e if it is expo&s;ed to the Air or too much Cold, the Wound will begin to &s;mart. It is likewi&s;e to be ob|&s;erved, if the Wound is made edgling or pointingly. In the la&s;t Ca&s;e the In&s;trument is to be anointed from the Point towards the Handle; in the fir&s;t, from the Edge towards the Back; and in all Ca&s;es the In&s;tru|ment is diligently to be cover'd. If it doth not ap|pear how deep the In&s;trument hath been in the Wound, all is to be anointed, but if it appears, only the Part which was plunged in the Wound.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="55">
<P>As for the Mo&s;s growing upon the Skull of a Man being hanged, it may &s;eem to many to be a u&s;ele&s;s Nicety, and that perhaps any other, tho' not grown upon the Skull of a Man hanged, may do the &s;ame. But the following Rea&s;on, with which I conclude, may be given for why the la&s;t hath a Pre|ference in the Compo&s;ition of this Magnetical Re|medy. The vital Spirits of a Man to be &s;trangled, by rea&s;on of the Pre&s;ence of his unhappy Chance, do retire to the Head and Brains, and the violent Con&s;triction hindereth their going back to their Prin|ciples; they remain al&s;o there and mingle, and are confounded with the Spirits and the Bal&s;am of the Head and Brains; and though all animal Functions do cea&s;e, neverthele&s;s there remains a certain Heat or Warmne&s;s in the Bones, Nerves, and the other &s;imi|lar Parts, which is in Stones and in Pepper, that is to &s;ay, an elemental one. Now after this Mixture, and through the help of this Heat and the joint working of a heavenly Influence, Mo&s;s, like a Vegetable grow|ing upon the Skull of a Man being hang'd, mu&s;t needs be of a greater Force than &s;uch as grows upon the Head of another who dy'd of &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
