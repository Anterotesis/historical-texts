<P>I Beg leave to lay before you the follow|ing Letters, which contain a &s;hort view of the improvements made in England in the cure of &s;imple fractures, within the&s;e la&s;t twenty years; a di&s;&s;ua&s;ive again&s;t &s;peedy amputation (except in &s;ome particular ca&s;es) in compound fractures; and &s;ome practical ob&s;ervations added to Mr. POTT'S theory on di&s;locations; tho' perhaps that letter which relates to the treatment of compound fractures, and the Po&s;t&s;cript on compound di&s;locations, may chiefly merit your attention.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
<P>I have always heard of <HI>&s;peedy amputation</HI> in &s;uch accidents with a&s;toni&s;hment and concern, e&s;pecially in the&s;e days, in which it is &s;aid Surgery had made &s;uch great &s;trides towards perfection; and was glad to &s;ee that Mr. BOUCHER<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Mem. Royal. Acad. Surg. vol. ii. Mem. 9.</NOTE> and Mr. BIL|GUER<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert. on the inutility of the amputat. of limbs.</NOTE> had re&s;olution enough to make a prote&s;t again&s;t this practice, which ap|pears to me mo&s;t frequently precipitate and unnece&s;&s;ary; tho' upon reading Mr. BIL|GUER'S book, I was &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that he had taken off from the weight of his arguments, by indi&s;criminately and almo&s;t totally forbidding this operation.</P>
<P>However, what Mr. POTT has now &s;aid about amputation in compound fractures, &s;eems to demand a further enquiry into this matter; and the reque&s;t of the young Gen|tleman, to whom the&s;e letters where writ|ten, has drawn me to undertake a ta&s;k, which I &s;hould have been glad to have &s;een
<PB N="iii" REF="5">done by &s;ome other per&s;on; for publickly di&s;&s;enting from the opinion of men truly eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion is extremely di&s;agreeable; and yet it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, when there is &s;ufficient ground to think what they have advanced may happen to prove injurious; for whatever comes from &s;uch hands, commonly makes deep impre&s;|&s;ion upon the minds of tho&s;e, who have not had experience enough to judge for them&s;elves. Nor can an ingenuous di&s;qui|&s;ition be di&s;plea&s;ing to a generous mind.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of confining to pri|vate u&s;e, what occurred to me while I was writing upon this &s;ubject, I al&s;o offer it to your notice; and if what I have a&s;&s;erted, upon proper enquiry is found to be true; it will, I hope, be thought a &s;ufficient apo|logy for this publication.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the fir&s;t opportunity that bu&s;i|ne&s;s will permit, of an&s;wering your Letter, dated the beginning of la&s;t month, by informing you, that I have read Mr. POTT'S book upon Fractures, which contains many valuable directions; and I know, that putting the mu&s;cles, as he advi&s;es, in a &s;tate of relaxation, both at the time of reduction, and during the re|mainder of the cure, will, on many ac|counts, be attended with great ea&s;e, and great advantage to the patient.</P>
<P>I imagine the rigid di&s;cipline of keep|ing fractured legs in a &s;tate of exten&s;ion, has not been &s;o &s;teadily adhered to, &s;ince Mr. PUGH<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of Midwifery, p. 150.</NOTE> in 1754, propo&s;ed, by the
<PB N="2" REF="8">u&s;e of his &s;plints, to move the patient from his back to his &s;ide, in order to give him relief in his &s;ituation; and wherever this method was practi&s;ed, the leg mu&s;t frequently be laid on one &s;ide with the knee bent, though, probably, often with|out being aware of all the advantages ari|&s;ing from this po&s;ture. Ever &s;ince the fir&s;t of May 1758<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">One O&s;bourne, of Donnington on the Heath, at this time broke his thigh &s;omewhere, near Leice&s;ter, and was brought home &s;everal miles in a coal wagon, over a very rough &s;tony road, by which means his thigh was violently &s;haken, and it afterwards &s;welled to an enormous &s;ize. To reduce this &s;welling, I applied a &s;tale beer poultice, and placed the mu&s;cles in a &s;tate of relaxation, by laying the thigh on one &s;ide, with the knee bent, which an&s;wered my expectation; for the patient &s;oon became very ea&s;y, and a compleat cure followed, with le&s;s trouble than I had ever before &s;een; and left no room for me to doubt, which was the be&s;t method of placing &s;imple fractures of the thigh.</NOTE>, I have con&s;tantly laid fractured thighs in the manner Mr. POTT directs, and believe it has been practi&s;ed by others, to whom I pointed out the ad|vantages of this &s;ituation; in particular, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to make a good cure, where the neck of the thigh bone is frac|tured, without putting the limb in a &s;tate of flexion<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that Mr. PUGH recommended the placing the thigh in a &s;tate of flexion when fractured at the neck, tho' he did not lay it on one &s;ide, but in a box contrived for this purpo&s;e.</NOTE>; but by this method I have
<PB N="3" REF="9">&s;een this accident cured without lame|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The old method of violent exten&s;ion to reduce fractured limbs, I do believe has been long di&s;u&s;ed, becau&s;e quite un|nece&s;&s;ary, and evidently, to every capa|city, injurious; nor do I remember ever &s;eeing it practi&s;ed, the bones being always capable of being laid &s;trait by gentle ex|ten&s;ion; and Mr. GOOCH<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See page 298.</NOTE>, ten years &s;ince, recommended this kind of treat|ment, in his Ca&s;es and Remarks in Sur|gery.</P>
<P>I imagine the limb, in &s;imple fractures, has not frequently been di&s;turbed, after be|ing properly placed, except by tho&s;e, who u&s;e no other than liquid di&s;cutients. We ne|ver unwrap or move it, till it will bear mov|ing, unle&s;s great &s;welling has made the u&s;e of poultices nece&s;&s;ary; for by applying a ce|rate, that, without irritating, is capable of attenuating the ob&s;tructed fluids, and of pre&s;erving the <HI>ve&s;&s;els</HI> in a &s;tate of acting upon their contents, we keep the part in a continual &s;tate of per&s;piration; &s;o that we have nothing to do, but to &s;ee that the limb lies ea&s;y, and is not di&s;placed; or, where a moderate &s;welling has taken place
<PB N="4" REF="10">before this application is u&s;ed, we gradu|ally draw our bandage and &s;plints a little tighter as the &s;welling &s;ub&s;ides. Whereas, tho&s;e who u&s;e embrocations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only, are daily di&s;turbing their bandage, and, after all, neglect that principal point of pre&s;erving the natural ela&s;ticity of the fi|bres, to which, where the parts are neither much brui&s;ed nor &s;welled, a <HI>proper degree of pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> by bandage may greatly contri|bute, by not &s;uffering the ve&s;&s;els to be di|&s;tended beyond their natural &s;tate; whence le&s;s inflammation, le&s;s pain, and con&s;e|quently le&s;s di&s;turbance will follow. This may be accompli&s;hed by the eighteen tail bandage, which has been long u&s;ed in &s;im|ple fractures: and Mr. GOOCH publickly took notice of the advantages that would ari&s;e from its &s;upplying the place of the common roller, in the Ca&s;es and Remarks we have referred to; but it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that Mr. POTT'S contrivance, of making the tails fold over each other in an oblique direction, is a con&s;iderable im|provement.</P>
<P>Mr. PUGH'S long &s;plints were made to &s;ecure both ends of the fractured bone. Mr. GOOCH<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;es and Remarks in Surgery, vol. ii. p. 300.</NOTE>, &s;ome years after, advi&s;ed the &s;ame practice; and both Mr. WATHEN
<PB N="5" REF="11">and Mr. SHARP have &s;ince made an im|provement, by adapting long &s;plints to the &s;hape of the leg.</P>
<P>So that you &s;ee the practice recommen|ded has been gradually taking place: tho' putting the limb in a &s;tate of flexion to a&s;|&s;i&s;t reduction is entirely new, except that Mr. SHARP, of Mincing-lane, a&s;&s;i&s;tant Surgeon of the &s;ame Ho&s;pital, has got the &s;tart of Mr. POTT, by laying, in Novem|ber, 1766, a paper before the Royal So|ciety, wherein he advi&s;es,</P>
<Q><P>when a Sur|geon is called to a fractured leg, at the place where the accident happens, let him lay the patient on the injured &s;ide, on a flat &s;urface, and rai&s;e the knee of the limb towards the abdomen, bending at the &s;ame time the knee-joint, &s;o as to put the exten&s;or mu&s;cles of the foot (which are the &s;tronge&s;t) into a &s;tate of relaxation. He will then be enabled to replace the ends of the fractured bones, and re&s;tore them to their proper &s;itua|tion, without the cu&s;tomary &s;trong ex|ten&s;ion of the lim, which is trouble|&s;ome to the Surgeon, painful to the pa|tient, and apt to bring on ten&s;ion, &s;pa&s;ms, and inflammation of the &s;tretched mu&s;|cles.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<P>The fracture being reduced, and the patient laid on a bed, upon which there is a mattre&s;s; the proper remedies, with the many tail bandage, which has been u&s;ed many years in St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital, and his long &s;plints are ap|plied; the patient is kept on his &s;ide, with the broken leg undermo&s;t, the knee bent, and the thigh drawn up, in&s;tead of laying him on his back, with the in|jured limb extended.&mdash;The&s;e &s;plints (he &s;ays) were fir&s;t applied, with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, in an oblique fracture of the Tibia (which could not be kept in a proper &s;i|tuation by the u&s;ual methods) and after|wards as happily in a di&s;location of the lower extremity of the &s;ame bone, ac|companied with a fracture of the Fibu|la. In this latter ca&s;e it is often diffi|cult to reduce the di&s;location, even with a &s;trong exten&s;ion, and more &s;o to re|tain the bones in their proper &s;ituation, whil&s;t the limb is laid in the u&s;ual ex|tended po&s;ture, both which difficulties are ab&s;olutely avoided by the means above de&s;cribed.</P></Q>
<P>&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, in ju|&s;tice to Mr. POTT, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that he is the fir&s;t writer who has <HI>&s;cienti|fically</HI> proved, that putting the mu&s;cles in a &s;tate of <HI>relaxation,</HI> and <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> is the mo&s;t proper method both of reducing
<PB N="7" REF="13">and curing fractures; and he has further demon&s;trably &s;hewn, that this part of Sur|gery, as well as the re&s;t, can only be re|gularly practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who under&s;tand the &s;tructure and u&s;e of the &s;everal parts of the body: notwith&s;tanding many <HI>bone|&s;etters</HI> have acquired reputation by pre|tending to have cured fractured limbs, which were never broken.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the fir&s;t opportunity of re|&s;uming this &s;ubject; and the next Letter I &s;end you, may, perhaps, be of a more intere&s;ting nature.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 20, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding I &s;o much approve of the directions Mr. POTT has given about treating &s;imple fractures, and pay the greate&s;t deference to his opinion, yet I think what he has &s;aid about the nece&s;&s;ity of immediate amputation in very bad compound fractures, is too general; for tho' the practice he recommends may be right in the Ho&s;pital, to which he is Surgeon, it does not follow, that the &s;ame &s;teps &s;hould be taken in the &s;ituation, in which you intend to place your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed, if amputation is to take place whenever the <HI>probable</HI> chance of de&s;truc|tion, from the nature and circum&s;tances of the accident, is greater than it would be from this operation, every limb mu&s;t be cut off, where the bones are &s;hattered, and the mu&s;cles <HI>con&s;iderably</HI> torn, as I Imagine, in general, in &s;ound habits am|putation would be attended with much
<PB N="9" REF="15">le&s;s trouble and more ab&s;olute certainty of recovery, than even a compound fracture, where the bone has made its way out in &s;uch a manner, as to give free admi&s;&s;ion to the air, without cau&s;ing any violent laceration of the mu&s;cles. And yet frac|tures, thus circum&s;tanced, &s;o frequently admit of cure, as to ju&s;tify every attempt to pre&s;erve the limb. Nor can I think, in private practice, the con&s;ideration of am|putation (where it is not <HI>fully evident,</HI> that the limb cannot hereafter be u&s;eful) often requires <HI>immediate</HI> determination; that a minute's delay will, many times, be to the patient's di&s;advantage; or that a &s;mall &s;pace of time will <HI>frequently</HI> make all the difference between probable &s;afety and fa|tality; if, according to Mr. POTT, imme|diate amputation is only to prevent gan|grene, or a large &s;uppuration, with forma|tion and lodgment of matter; for gan|grenes following injuries mu&s;t be either <HI>local,</HI> from the violence of the injury, or &s;ucceeding inflammation, or they mu&s;t ari&s;e from a bad habit of body, or both cau&s;es joined.</P>
<P>If a gangrene is only local, we need not be precipitate in our determination; be|cau&s;e, by proper management, it will cer|tainly &s;top, when it comes to the parts
<PB N="10" REF="16">which are not injured. If it is likely to ari&s;e from a bad habit of body, amputa|tion will not prevent it, as the wound fol|lowing the operation will mo&s;t likely mor|tify; for in a gangrenous di&s;po&s;ition of the fluids, this di&s;ea&s;e as frequently manife&s;ts it&s;elf in &s;imple, as in more complex wounds; and &s;urely there are other methods to re|medy large &s;uppuration or lodgement of matter; or at lea&s;t we ought not to am|putate, till we &s;ee the di&s;charge is greater than the patient can bear. So that you &s;ee, there will always be time for delibe|ration; whence we &s;hall act with a cer|taintly that cannot be known, except in particular ca&s;es, when we are fir&s;t called to the patient, and if nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hall have opportunities of performing the ope|ration, before he becomes incapable of un|dergoing its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But Mr. POTT is of a very different opinion; he &s;ays,</P>
<Q><P>when gangrene and mortification are the mere con&s;equence of the time of, or by the fracture, it ge|nerally makes its appearance very eaerly; in which ca&s;e al&s;o, its progre&s;s is gene|rally too rapid for art to check. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, when the mi&s;chief &s;eems to be of &s;uch a nature, as that gangrene
<PB N="11" REF="17">and mortification are mo&s;t likely to en|&s;ue, no time can be &s;pared, and the im|pending mi&s;chief mu&s;t either be &s;ub|mitted to, or prevented by early ampu|tation. I have already &s;aid, that a very few hours make all the difference be|tween probable &s;afety and de&s;truction. If we wait till the di&s;ea&s;e has taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the limb, even in the &s;malle&s;t degree, the operation will an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, but that of accelerating the patient's death. If we wait for an ap|parent alteration in the part, we &s;hall have waited until all opportunity of be|ing really &s;erviceable is pa&s;t. The di&s;|ea&s;e takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cellular mem|brane &s;urrounding the large blood ve&s;&s;els and nerves, &s;ome time before it makes any appearance in the integuments, and will always be found to extend much higher in the former, than its appear|ance in the latter &s;eems to indicate. I have more than once &s;een the experi|ment made of amputating, after a gan|grene has begun, but I never &s;aw it &s;ucceed; it has always ha&s;tened the pa|tient's de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I would therefore advi&s;e, that &s;uch attempt &s;hould never be made; but the fir&s;t opportunity having been neglected,
<PB N="12" REF="18">or not embraced, all the power of the chirurgical art is to be employed in a&s;|&s;i&s;ting nature to &s;eparate the di&s;ea&s;ed part from the &s;ound; an attempt which, now and then, under partiuclar circum|&s;tances, has proved &s;ucce&s;sful, but is &s;o rarely &s;o, as not to be much depended upon.</P>
<P>If the parts are &s;o brui&s;ed and torn, that the circulation through them is rendered impracticable; or if the gan|grene is the immediate effect of &s;uch mi&s;chief; the con&s;equence of omitting amputation, and of attempting to &s;ave the limb, is, as I have already ob&s;erved, mo&s;t frequently very early de&s;truction: But if the gangrenous mi&s;chief be not merely and immediately the effect of the wounded &s;tate of the parts, but of high inflammation, badne&s;s of general habit, improper di&s;po&s;ition of the limb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is &s;ometimes in our power &s;o to allevi|ate, correct, and alter the&s;e cau&s;es, as to obtain a truce with the di&s;ea&s;e, and a &s;eparation of the un&s;ound parts from the &s;ound.</P></Q>
<P>Now, I have not any doubt, but, in St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital, what is here &s;aid about the rapidity and untractablene&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="19">of mortifications, ari&s;ing merely from in|jury done to the limb, is exactly true; for I can readily conceive, in this &s;itua|tion, local, will often be converted into the mo&s;t malignant &s;preading gangrenes, in oppo&s;ition to the utmo&s;t care and good management. Otherwi&s;e it has always been thought, that gangrenes from a bad habit of body are more difficult of cure, than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the wounded &s;tate of the parts; for from the days of HIPPOCRATES, down to RUSHWORTH, gangrenes, from a bad habit of body, were always, by the able&s;t Surgeons, deemed to be incurable; whereas in&s;tances abound of mortifications from the violence of the injury alone being cured by amputation<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The &s;ucce&s;s which attended amputation in <HI>local</HI> gan|grenes inclining to &s;pread, probably for want of proper di&s;tinction, brought it <HI>indi&s;criminately</HI> into u&s;e in <HI>&s;preading</HI> gangrenes ari&s;ing from a di&s;ea&s;ed habit; where it would always prove in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer any good end. And though we do not recommend amputation in any kind of gangrene, will it is &s;topped; yet, from this &s;tate of the matter, we &s;ee the rea&s;on why it has, in this ca&s;e, both been advi&s;ed and rejected.</NOTE>, cauterization, cau&s;tics, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and though &s;ince the u&s;e of the bark in this di&s;ea&s;e has been known, we can often cure gan|grenes ari&s;ing from an internal cau&s;e, yet in the country, I have con&s;tantly found,
<PB N="14" REF="20">that tho&s;e, which ari&s;e &s;imply from the injury, are with more certainty relieved.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is not any thing which contributes more to a true method of treat|ing mortifications, than making a proper di&s;tinction betwixt one mortification and another; and my practice &s;everal years ago led me to di&s;cover the difference in them already mentioned; which di&s;tinc|tions have ever &s;ince been of great u&s;e to me in the management of this di&s;order: But as I cannot find, that what I &s;aid a|bout this matter, in my treati&s;e of Gan|grenes, is attended to, I &s;hall here de&s;cribe &s;eparately the &s;ymptoms accompanying a mortification, ari&s;ing from a gangrenous di&s;po&s;ition of the juices; and a local mor|tification, when merely the con&s;equence of external injury.</P>
<P>When a mortification in compound fractures ari&s;es from a gangrenous di&s;po&s;i|tion of the juices; &s;oon after the injury is received, whether a large wound is made by external violence, or a &s;mall wound by protru&s;ion of the broken bone, the lymph, which &s;tagnates about the wound, imme|diately inflames and corrodes the ve&s;&s;els which contain it; when air bubbles in the membrana adipo&s;a, and other membranes, are in&s;tantly formed; which air bubbles,

<P>If an inci&s;ion is made into the affected part, when the air bubbles are fir&s;t formed, it is &s;en&s;ible, and blood is di&s;charged from the arteries in a florid &s;tate, as free as u&s;ual; the membrana adipo&s;a is of a dark|i&s;h yellow colour, and the mu&s;cles only appear browner than common.

<P>On the contrary, when the mortifica|tion ari&s;es <HI>&s;imply</HI> from injury done to the limb, it is not preceded by a gangrene, but comes on in con&s;equence of an ab&s;o|lute &s;tagnation of the blood and juices alone; and accordingly the <HI>&s;kin</HI> and all the injured parts become dead and putrid at the &s;ame time, without any previous Em|phy&s;ema<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">A mortification, ari&s;ing from a weakne&s;s and defi|ciency of native heat, comes on in the &s;ame manner, only more gradual, with the &s;ame appearances; and &s;hould a compound fracture happen to a per&s;on in years, in a weak &s;tate of health, this kind of mortification may &s;eize him; but the &s;tate of the patient will di&s;cover the nature of his di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE>. If an inci&s;ion is early made, the part is in&s;en&s;ible; no other than ex|trava&s;ated blood is di&s;charged; nor do I ever remember &s;eeing a mortification ari&s;e from this cau&s;e, except in gun&s;hot wounds, without the &s;kin &s;uffering equally with the &s;ubjacent parts; for if the mu&s;cles are only lacerated by the ends of the broken bone, &s;uppuration, in&s;tead of mortification, as in other lacerated wounds, is always the common con&s;equence, if no other cau&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="23">interferes; becau&s;e the circulation, except in the divided parts, is not entirely inter|rupted.</P>
<P>In this kind of mortification, the coun|tenance continues &s;erene; nor does any other fever &s;upervene, but &s;uch as is com|mon to contu&s;ed wounds; and unle&s;s the affected part is very near the body, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;lowly extends it&s;elf (not by air bubbles taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cellular membrane &s;urrounding the large blood ve&s;|&s;els and nerves, &s;ome times before it makes its appearance in the integuments, as when it ari&s;es from a bad habit of body, but) by the acrid fluids corroding the neighbouring parts, in the manner of a cau&s;tic, till mat|ter enough is ab&s;orbed to contaminate, un|le&s;s prevented, the whole ma&s;s of blood. But &s;o far as I can judge about this mat|ter, a &s;top may always be put to a local &s;phacelus; for I have never &s;een a morti|fication ari&s;ing merely from the injury done to the part, which did not give way to pro|per management. The &s;ame kind of &s;uc|ce&s;s probably induced Mr. GOOCH, after forty years experience, to &s;ay, that a mor|tification, attending a compound fracture, &s;hould not alarm the Surgeon to a ha&s;ty determination of the lo&s;s of the limb; and I am apprehen&s;ive, you will often commit
<PB N="18" REF="24">mi&s;takes, greatly injurious to your patient, if you &s;uppo&s;e every local mortification as fatal as tho&s;e in the Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>However, the chief rea&s;on which in|duces me to differ in opinion from Mr. POTT, is the &s;ucce&s;s of the country Sur|geons; who, unle&s;s the parts are &s;o de|&s;troyed as to be evidently irrecoverable, &s;eldom amputate, and as &s;eldom fail in their attempts to cure. From the be&s;t in|formation I can procure, I do believe the country Practitioners, who have been really bred Surgeons, do not take off more than one limb in twenty, which has received a compound fracture; nor do they, upon an average, lo&s;e more than one in ten of tho&s;e they attempt to cure without ampu|tation. And &s;urely, if matter of fact is of any con&s;equence, tho' Mr. BILGUER is far from having proved the <HI>inutility</HI> of am|putation; yet he certainly has given proof enough to &s;hew, that <HI>immediate</HI> amputa|tion is not often nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances may &s;eem to call in que&s;tion the judgment of Mr. POTT, in &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly recommending immediate amputation; but their &s;ucce&s;s in the Ho&s;|pital, I dare &s;ay, fully ju&s;tifies all he has &s;aid; for I do verily believe, in very bad compound fractures, their attempts to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="19" REF="25">limbs have mo&s;t frequently been fru|&s;trated by the death of the patients, and that the e&s;capes are much too rare to be made precedents. It therefore is certainly from a principle of humanity, that he re|commends a remedy, from which, in his &s;ituation, it has been found, that the chance of death is by no means equal to that ari&s;ing from &s;uch kind of fracture; which leads us to examine, how it comes to pa&s;s, that the country Surgeons are more &s;ucce&s;sful in the cure of compound fractures, than tho&s;e Gentlemen who have the care of great and crowded Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire, what is the immediate cau&s;e of death in compound fractures; and, if we except a lo&s;s of blood from the principal arteries beihg divided, (which, I believe, is very &s;eldom fatal,) it will probably appear owing to a putrid &s;tate of the fluids; for this is manife&s;tly the ca&s;e, when death is brought on by a gangrene, ari&s;ing from a bad habit of body; and when, by a mor|tification, brought on &s;imply by injury done to the parts, the patient is chiefly de&s;troyed by an ab&s;orption of putrid mat|ter. If he peri&s;hes by a putrid fever, it is al&s;o incon&s;equence of an ab&s;orption of pu|trid blood, or putrid matter ari&s;ing from
<PB N="20" REF="26">brui&s;ed fle&s;h; if, by a colliquative fever, the putrid matter which is ab&s;orbed, being le&s;s active, produces its effects more &s;lowly. But it &s;ometimes gives ri&s;e to internal ab|&s;ce&s;&s;es, always weakens the fibres, and de&s;troys the cra&s;is of the blood; whence the di&s;charge from the &s;ore, and other eva|cuations, become too great, and the patient is exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is no wonder, then, that rapid morti|fications, and great di&s;charges of matter, &s;hould fru&s;trate their attempts to cure bad compound fractures in a large Ho&s;pital, in the mid&s;t of a great and populous city, where the air the patient breathes, not|with&s;tanding the greate&s;t care, combines with the cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;orders in his de|&s;truction; for it is well known, where a great number of people breathe con&s;tantly in the &s;ame room, the air is not only de&s;titute of its vivifying &s;pirit, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of life, but it really be|comes putrid from being confined, and re|peatedly in&s;pired, and from being loaded with the putrid exhalations ari&s;ing from mortifications, different kinds of &s;ores, di&s;|ea&s;ed bodies, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> And perhaps, too, the general methods u&s;ed here, may contribute to the di&s;patch of many of the&s;e unfortunate people; for porters, and tho&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="27">who have been u&s;ed to drink plentifully of drams, beer, and the like, will &s;ink even under the full diet of the Ho&s;pital, and die for want of &s;ome indulgence in the&s;e bad habits, which are now, from cu&s;tom, be|come nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tants in &s;upporting the &s;trength of the body; &s;o that the Gentle|men of the Ho&s;pital labour under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages, and we may won|der, that any recover, rather than that mo&s;t die. Whereas, in the country, the patient has every po&s;&s;ible advantage from purity of air: nor are we tied down to &s;ett rules; but from learning the former man|ner, in which the patient has lived, we &s;upply him properly with tho&s;e things to which he has been accu&s;tomed; and I have repeatedly &s;een the mo&s;t &s;alutary ef|fects follow a due allowance of ale, wine, or brandy; where a few days low diet has brought on want of &s;leep, delirium, lo&s;s of appetite, and an ill &s;tate of the wound.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be worth while to en|quire, too, whether free and frequent bleed|ing, to prevent or remove inflammation in every compound fracture, may not &s;ome|times ha&s;ten the di&s;&s;olution of the patient; for, notwith&s;tanding it may &s;eem proper during the &s;tate of inflammation, yet by thinning the blood, emptying the ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="22" REF="28">and reducing the &s;trength, a greatel ab|&s;orption of matter follows after the inflam|mation is gone off, and produces more vio|lent effects.</P>
<P>I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, whenever the patient has lo&s;t much blood at the time of the accident, or whenever I have been called where there has been a free u&s;e of the lancet, that colliquative &s;weats, loo&s;e|ne&s;s, and a greater di&s;charge from the ul|cer is &s;ooner the con&s;equence of the ab|&s;orption of matter, and with much more violence, than when the patient was le&s;s reduced; and it is very probable, if the&s;e people had lived upon &s;pare diet, and breathed the air of an ho&s;pital, their com|plaints had &s;till been aggravated, till death had been the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I well remember, that the Gentleman I &s;erved my apprentice&s;hip with, very &s;el|dom bled in compound fractures; and, what may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e, who are fond of bleeding, it was impo&s;&s;ible for any man living to have better &s;ucce&s;s; and many accidents of this kind fell under our care. Nor was this treatment confined to his practice alone; for, upon enquiring, I have been informed by others of long ex|perience, who have al&s;o had remarkable
<PB N="23" REF="29">good &s;ucce&s;s in the cure of the&s;e acci|dents, that, like him, they always ha&s;ten|ed the dige&s;tion of the wound without <HI>much bleeding.</HI></P>
<P>For my own part, I have always been cautious in reducing the patient's &s;trength; yet in &s;trong plethoric habits, where much blood has not been lo&s;t at the time of the accident, e&s;pecially if heated by liquor, which is not infrequent, I commonly take blood away, to prevent great inflamma|tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But, on the other hand, where the haemorrhage has been con&s;iderable, or where the patient is rather of a weak con|&s;titution, I defer the operation, and only afterwards bleed, if the &s;ymptoms of in|flammation peremptorily demand this eva|cuation: But this rarely or never happens; and I have &s;eldom found the tumor, pain, and inflammation or fever, ri&s;e &s;o high, as to make repeated bleeding nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>if proper care has been taken of the limb;</HI> not only by placing it in a proper po&s;ition, and then leaving nature to accompli&s;h her own work; but by u&s;ing &s;uch applications, as are capable of giving her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And even where improper applications have been u&s;ed, or the injury for &s;ome hours intirely neglected, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that great tumor and inflammation have come on,
<PB N="24" REF="30">even till bli&s;ters have ari&s;en upon the part, yet &s;o much bleeding is not here nece&s;&s;ary, as theory may lead us to think; for the di&s;charge from the&s;e bli&s;ters, when pro|perly promoted, a&s;&s;i&s;ts in taking off the ten&s;ion by unloading the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els; and if to the topical remedies, <HI>moderate bleeding,</HI> antiphlogi&s;tic &s;udorifics, and me|dicines which purge, are joined, the tu|mor commonly declines in a few days; for I find, when the&s;e &s;ymptoms ari&s;e from &s;imple inflammation, they are not &s;o for|midable, as their appearance might lead us to think. Repeated bleeding, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is only required to prevent an increa&s;e of inflammation, by le&s;&s;ening the im|pul&s;e of the blood again&s;t the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els, when too violent, for which pur|po&s;e the lo&s;s of a moderate quantity is &s;uf|ficient; and if you will have a little pa|tience, the di&s;charge from the &s;ore will mo&s;t effectually remove every di&s;agreeable &s;ymptom; for wherever the ob&s;tructed flu|ids can be outwardly di&s;charged, it makes a material difference in the treatment from tho&s;e inflammations where no evacuation can be made from the affected part.</P>
<P>There is not any doubt, but antiphlo|gi&s;tic medicines, a &s;pare, cooling diet, and an open belly, are, in general, proper,
<PB N="25" REF="31">while the limb is in a &s;tate of inflamma|tion; but where this treatment has been carried much farther, I do think, with Mr. POTT, that <Q>it has not unfrequently been the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s both of limbs and lives.</Q> We therefore do not wait till the appetite begins to fail, and the pa|tient &s;weats and purges without a&s;&s;ignable cau&s;e, or in con&s;equence of a large di&s;|charge of matter from the limb, before we alter our proceedings; for when things are come to this pa&s;s, it may often be im|po&s;&s;ible to find remedies &s;ufficient to cure the di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e &s;ymptoms, therefore, mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t, rather than &s;uf|fered to take place; for which purpo&s;e, as &s;oon as dige&s;tion appears, and the pul&s;e becomes quieter, the bark &s;hould imme|diately be given, which may be done with the utmo&s;t &s;afety, and a more generous diet gradually allowed, as the appetite re|turns; for tho' exce&s;s &s;hould be carefully avoided, yet entirely altering the way of living of the patient, certainly leads to de|&s;truction; and I believe the be&s;t way of treating him, is only to abridge him a lit|tle of his u&s;ual diet, when it has been of that kind which has a tendency to inflame, or greatly enrich the blood, remembring the aphori&s;m of HIPPOCRATES, that <Q><HI>a &s;lender and &s;trict diet is, in lingering di&s;|ea&s;es,
<PB N="26" REF="32">always dangerous.</HI></Q> So much for the general method of treating the pa|tient; now let us more particularly con&s;i|der the injured limb.</P>
<P>What Mr. POTT &s;ays about the reduc|tion of the limb, carries conviction along with it; but much of your future good &s;ucce&s;s depends upon removing loo&s;ened, and detached, or &s;harp pointed bones, ex|traneous bodies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing, by the practice of freely dilating the wound where it is too &s;mall for this purpo&s;e; by which means, you reduce the wound nearer to <HI>a &s;imple &s;tate,</HI> and not only prevent irri|tation, pain, and their con&s;equences; but render future probing and examining into the &s;ore unnece&s;&s;ary; and thus avoid many inconveniences that might ari&s;e from that indi&s;creet practice.</P>
<P>This operation &s;hould always be done without violence; but I am fearful you will &s;carce always be able to remove loo&s;|ened or &s;harp pointed bones, which ought to be taken away, without giving pain; but the patient will &s;uffer much le&s;s, if they are removed ju&s;t after the accident has happened, while the parts are rather in&s;en&s;ible, than after inflammation has ta|ken place. Indeed it appears to me, that we &s;hould not, if it can be done without
<PB N="27" REF="33">great violence, or lacerating any large blood ve&s;&s;el, omit removing, at the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing, whatever may cau&s;e irritation; for I have con&s;tantly found, when the&s;e, along with the coagulated blood, are in|&s;tantly taken away, the patient always re|covers with much more ea&s;e both to him|&s;elf and his Surgeon.</P>
<P>But tho' what is &s;aid about the reduc|tion of the leg appears to be perfectly right; yet there are &s;ome other things which require con&s;ideration; for if the wound happens to be on the out, or under &s;ide, mu&s;t not the leg be moved every dre&s;&s;ing? &mdash; This circum&s;tance has e&s;caped Mr. POTT'S notice; but Mr. SHARP<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">New method of treating fractured legs.</NOTE> &s;ays, <Q>the leg may be &s;upported by a &s;teady hand again&s;t the upper &s;plint, and put into any po&s;ture that may be nece&s;|&s;ary to dre&s;s a &s;ore on the fibula, or un|der part.</Q> But I am very apprehen&s;ive, let the hand be ever &s;o &s;teady, this moving will overbalance all advantages from &s;itua|tion. Again, if the wound happens to be on the inward or upper &s;ide, the matter will lodge till the wound is full enough to run over; and part being ab&s;orbed, pro|duce tho&s;e evils &s;o loudly complained of in
<PB N="28" REF="34">the ho&s;pitals<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">To remedy this inconvenience, I have lately placed a fractured leg, where the wound was on the upper &s;ide, &s;o, that there was a declivity from the &s;hin to the calf; by which means the matter did not lodge; for I would not, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> give up the advantages ari&s;ing from the relaxed &s;tate of the mu&s;cles.</NOTE>. On the other hand, if the wound is on the &s;hin, or on the back part of the leg, the &s;ide po&s;ition is mo&s;t favourable for the di&s;charge of matter; &s;o that it may be well worth con&s;idering, whether the wound ought not to direct us in what manner to place the leg. If it &s;hould be thought prudent, under &s;ome circum&s;tances, &s;till to place it after re|duction in the old po&s;ture, the practice of &s;awing off the protruding bone mu&s;t &s;ome|times take place, which operation is done without much trouble, or any hazard, and always with great advantage to the pa|tient. Whereas the lodging of matter is always capable of producing mi&s;chievous, and frequently fatal effects, and &s;hould be guarded again&s;t, not only by an enlarge|ment of the wound, when too &s;mall, but by every other &s;tep that can be taken.</P>
<P>Dry lint is very properly advi&s;ed, as the be&s;t application, where the fracture is likely to heal by the fir&s;t intention; for in order to promote a reunion of the parts,
<PB N="29" REF="35">we &s;hould avoid every &s;tep that u&s;ually brings on dige&s;tion; and dry lint, in it&s;elf, has no property of promoting dige&s;tion. Mr. SHARP &s;ays, <Q>by this new po&s;ition, if the fracture be compound, the wound generally heals by the fir&s;t intention, the great impediment (irritation) being pre|vented;</Q> and there is no doubt but this practice may contribute much to a reunion. But on the contrary Mr. POTT &s;ays, <Q>the cure by the fir&s;t intention is the ca&s;e of &s;ome of the lucky few.</Q> And from what I have &s;een of this matter, the cure by this method can only take place, when the bone is &s;imply broken, and comes thro' the &s;kin, without cau&s;ing great laceration; for when the wound is &s;o large as to give a free admi&s;&s;ion to the air, &s;uppuration follows. Therefore, when from this cir|cum&s;tance it appears, that the cure by &s;uppuration mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, the wound &s;hould be dre&s;&s;ed with a <HI>dige&s;tive bal&s;am &s;uited to the degree of irritability of the pa|tient,</HI> in&s;tead of dry lint; by which treat|ment you will find ea&s;e and dige&s;tion much &s;ooner procured; for the inflammation will not ri&s;e &s;o high as when dry lint is u&s;ed<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. MONRO, to avoid the inconveniences which attended the application of a&s;tringents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> u&s;ually ap|plied after operations to &s;uppre&s;s the bleeding of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, judiciou&s;ly &s;ays, <Q>there is occa&s;ion for no other application to the wound than the threads of &s;oft half-worn linen, which the French call <HI>charpie,</HI> the Engli&s;h <HI>lint,</HI> and we <HI>caddi&s;s,</HI> which is a gentle ab&s;orbent, is &s;oft and ea&s;y to the wound, and by the corrupting liquors it imbibes, proves one of the &s;tronge&s;t, mo&s;t mild, and &s;afe &s;uppuratives. <BIBL><HI>Ed. Med. E&s;&s;.</HI> vol. iv. p. 267.</BIBL></Q>
<P>This doctrine Mr. SAMUEL SHARPE afterwards applied to wounds in general, without con&s;idering that the enco|mium Mr. MONRO be&s;towed upon dry lint, was to &s;hew its preference to the a&s;tringents, which u&s;ed to hinder di|ge&s;tion, by con&s;tringing the mouths of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, or that in accidental wounds, it is &s;eldom wanted to &s;uppre&s;s bleeding; and that notwith&s;tanding in the <HI>end</HI> by collecting the corrupting liquors it proves a &s;uppurative, yet certainly nature may be better a&s;&s;i&s;ted in promoting dige&s;tion; for when dry lint only is applied, the divided ve&s;&s;els inflame, and the ob&s;truction continues till the confined juices be|come acrid enough to give them&s;elves liberty. Whereas, when a mild bal&s;am, of a <HI>proper con&s;i&s;tence,</HI> is applied, the ve&s;&s;els are pre&s;erved in a &s;tate capable of giving way to the impul&s;e of the fluids, le&s;s ten&s;ion will of cour&s;e follow, and more ea&s;e to the patient. But (rea&s;oning apart,) if dry lint is applied, a week or more elap&s;es before dige&s;tion is compleat, during which time, the part remains hot, &s;well|ed, and painful. If a dige&s;tive bal&s;am is u&s;ed, a good di|ge&s;tion follows in two or three days, and the patient com|plains of much le&s;s &s;orene&s;s and pain, than when contrary &s;teps have been taken.</P></NOTE>; and it is mo&s;t certainly not only
<PB N="30" REF="36">your duty to avoid doing mi&s;chief, but al&s;o to <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, by removing every thing in|jurious, and by &s;upplying her with what is wanting to perform a cure;</HI> in which the whole art of Surgery con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>However, this dre&s;&s;ing mu&s;t be conti|nued no longer than till the tumor and in|flammation
<PB N="31" REF="37">are intirely gone, dige&s;tion is compleat, and the &s;ore becomes clean; le&s;t too great a di&s;charge &s;hould be pro|cured, when dry lint, or lint dipped in &s;imple tincture of myrrh, may be applied; for tho' the&s;e &s;pirituous dre&s;&s;ings manife&s;tly do injury till the &s;tate of inflammation is over; yet afterwards, where the di&s;charge is great, I think they do &s;ervice, by bra|cing up the relaxed fibres.</P>
<P>What Mr. POTT &s;ays about relaxing catapla&s;ms, well de&s;erves your attention; for tho' great inflammation requires great relaxation, yet by over relaxing parts, which are not much &s;welled, the juices &s;tagnate, and ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, or large &s;uppuration, is the con&s;equence: and I make not any doubt, but many have fallen victims to this prac|tice.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, I do not think the <HI>form</HI> of the applications u&s;ed to keep off inflammation, where poultices are im|proper, immaterial: for tho' &s;ome of the liquid di&s;cutients generally applied, are powerfully capable of attenuating ob&s;truct|ed fluids, yet they are de&s;titute of the other properties, which are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent inflammation; for, as I take it, the topi|cal remedies, calculated for this intention, &s;hould both attenuate ob&s;tructed fluids, and
<PB N="32" REF="38">at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve the ve&s;&s;els in a &s;tate capable of acting upon their contents; whence the circulation and per&s;piration are carried on regularly in the neighbour|ing parts about the wound, and great in|flammation is thereby prevented. Where|as, when embrocations alone are u&s;ed, a &s;tagnation of the juices does, in a greater or le&s;s degree, en&s;ue, from the &s;kin be|coming hard and dry betwixt the times of dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>This I do not a&s;&s;ert from the nature of things only, but from experience; having frequently been called to people, where lo|tions, dry lint, a pledget of dige&s;tive, and the eighteen tail bandage were the only applications that came in contact with the limb, which I always found remarkably ten&s;e and painful; &s;ometimes the &s;welling and inflammation were ri&s;en to a very great height, and ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, which might have been prevented, were the con&s;e|quence. It would be well, therefore, for tho&s;e who pur&s;ue this method of practice, to con&s;ider whether it is not owing to this kind of treatment that they are obliged to have recour&s;e to large and repeated do&s;es of opium to ea&s;e pain; for I do aver, that we who follow a different method of cure, are &s;eldom or never under any &s;ort of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="33" REF="39">of having recour&s;e to that remedy. Indeed, if our applications are not com|pounded with a view both of attenuating ob&s;tructed fluids, and of pre&s;erving the ve&s;&s;els as near their natural &s;tate as po&s;&s;i|ble, we fall very &s;hort of the true inten|tions of cure. And I am very certain, if this circum&s;tance is duly attended to, and the&s;e lacerated wounds, which cannot be cured by the fir&s;t intention, are brought &s;peedily to dige&s;tion by the method already recommended, even in bad habits, and where the ca&s;e is not fortunately circum|&s;tanced, the inflammation will, for the mo&s;t part, be kept within due bounds, without hazarding the con&s;equences of lo&s;ing a great deal of blood by vene&s;ec|tion.</P>
<P>From what I have already &s;aid, you &s;ee I entirely agree with Mr. POTT, that per|fect quietude is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of compound fractures; but we have at the &s;ame time &s;hewn, when the leg is laid on one &s;ide, this injunction cannot al|ways be complied with; and I imagine, as &s;oon as the fractured bones acquire &s;ome degree of firmne&s;s (but not before) the knee-joint &s;hould be gently moved<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See SHARP'S new Method of treating Fractures, p. 12.</NOTE>, to
<PB N="34" REF="40">prevent that contraction of the tendons of the ham, which might probably take place, if the knee was &s;uffered to remain bent eight or ten weeks without &s;tirring.</P>
<P>The chief rea&s;on, which has ever indu|ced Surgeons to remove compound frac|tures, has been to keep them clean. But to defend the bandage from matter, and to prevent us from being under any nece&s;|&s;ity of changing it often, Mr. GOOCH<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;es, p. 102. or &s;econd edit. p. 293. vol. i.</NOTE> recommended the green oil-ca&s;e cloth to be placed on the out&s;ide of the compre&s;|&s;es; to which I have found it nece&s;&s;ary to add pieces of &s;punge, both above and be|low the wound, to prevent the matter from running out at each end; by which means, I have frequently kept the ban|dage clean enough, &s;ix weeks or two months, without once moving the limb, where the di&s;charge has been con&s;idera|ble.</P>
<P>JUNKS, you know, have commonly been u&s;ed in compound fractures, to keep the limb &s;teady, which purpo&s;e they an|&s;wer very well, when properly made, and properly applied; neverthele&s;s they cannot be u&s;ed in the &s;ide-po&s;ition of the limb; and Mr. POTT, you &s;ee, advi&s;es the long
<PB N="35" REF="41">&s;plints, which &s;upply their place, and lie very commodiou&s;ly upon the part in this &s;ituation. However, it is worth con&s;ider|ing, whether they are not liable to one of the principal objections again&s;t the u&s;e of &s;hort &s;plints, in the cure of compound fractures, which is confining the matter, that ought to be di&s;charged, as they lie flat upon the leg. The fracture box kept the leg &s;teady; but by pre&s;&s;ing up the &s;ides of the pillow, it often confined the matter; whence I &s;oon laid a&s;ide this piece of trumpery, and always &s;ucceeded with the mo&s;t ea&s;e, when my apparatus was mo&s;t &s;imple. Indeed there is &s;impli|city in the&s;e long &s;plints, and when the wound is conveniently &s;ituated for the pur|po&s;e, they may often be very u&s;eful, if bol&s;ters to prevent their pre&s;&s;ing upon the &s;ore are at the &s;ame time applied. I have often u&s;ed long &s;plints towards the clo&s;e of the cure, in compound fractures, with advantage; and, I imagine, Mr. POTT can only mean to recommend them under particular circum&s;tances; for you will cer|tainly meet with accidents of this &s;ort, in which &s;plints at fir&s;t, either long or &s;hort, would be improper, on account of the vi|olence of the injury.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="42">
<P>Strengthening the injured limb, when it is become &s;oft and flabby, by relaxing ca|tapla&s;ms, is another material circum&s;tance: But this, I am apprehen&s;ive, cannot be well effected by the application of corro|borating medicines alone; and I &s;hall therefore ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that among&s;t all the remedies, no one can contribute more to the cure of compound fractures, than a due degree of pre&s;&s;ure by the eighteen tail bandage properly timed. And, I ima|gine, it can only be owing to a general di&s;u&s;e in the ho&s;pitals, that &s;o many Sur|geons have not attended to the advan|tages ari&s;ing from this valuable branch of Surgery. We were before told by Mr. SHARP<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Pref. to Crit. Enquiry.</NOTE>, that <Q>the chief purpo&s;e of bandage was to maintain the due &s;itua|tion of a dre&s;&s;ing, or to make a com|pre&s;s on particular parts;</Q> and I cannot find that Mr. POTT u&s;es it in fractures for any other purpo&s;e, than keeping the dre&s;&s;ings in their proper place; and yet, where a compound fracture will admit of cure by the fir&s;t intention, it certainly promotes a reunion; and in every ca&s;e, where it can fir&s;t be applied, it prevents inflammation and pain, and forwards a re|gular
<PB N="37" REF="43">&s;uppuration; for, if by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a due degree of pre&s;&s;ure, a di&s;ten|&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;els and fibres is not &s;uffered to take place, nor their &s;ides drawn nearer together than u&s;ual, the nerves will be put le&s;s upon the &s;tretch, the ve&s;&s;els will be le&s;s loaded, and more capable of acting upon their contents; of cour&s;e the circu|lation will be more regular, and the fluids will be tran&s;mitted properly into the &s;ore.</P>
<P>But the&s;e advantages cannot be ex|pected where the parts are much brui&s;ed or lacerated, or where inflammation has already taken place, becau&s;e the ve&s;&s;els are become impervious. And, pre&s;&s;ure, where the fluids are incapable of moving, mu&s;t be injurious, by confirming the ob&s;truc|tion, and by increa&s;ing pain, where &s;en&s;a|tion, from the nerves being in a &s;tate of ten&s;ion, is become acute.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, when in con&s;equence of the di&s;charge, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pro|per remedies, the ob&s;truction and inflam|mation are removed, no application is &s;o capable, as bandage, of preventing a large di&s;charge, by &s;trengthening the ve&s;&s;els and fibres, and re&s;toring them to their pri&s;tine &s;tate. And notwith&s;tanding &s;inus's and ab&s;ce&s;&s;es are freely opened, and counter openings made, which I would always re|commend,
<PB N="38" REF="44">matter will lodge, if bandage is not applied, and be productive of much mi&s;chief; and indeed, when the u&s;e of this a&s;&s;i&s;tant is omitted, &s;inus's will often be formed, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to open with any great advantage; for where the eighteen tail bandage, after being &s;prin|kled with an embrocation, had only been applied, with a view to keep on the dre&s;|&s;ings, or to make a compre&s;s on a particu|lar part; I have found, at the end of ten or twelve weeks, or &s;ometimes longer, &s;i|nus's penetrating deep among&s;t the mu&s;|cles, and running, in different directions, almo&s;t all over the limb. Be&s;ides, the fle&s;hy fibres had more the appearance of a jelly, than fle&s;h; and the patients were &s;inking under a hectic fever, and a deluge of matter, which I take to be owing to the height of bad Surgery; becau&s;e when the dre&s;&s;ings and bandage have been from time to time properly adapted, and the patient's &s;trength pre&s;erved from the be|ginning, this violent relaxation never hap|pens, fewer &s;inus's are formed, and the di&s;charge is &s;eldom or never<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Perhaps this a&s;&s;ertion may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e, who have had the mortification of &s;eeing their patients die, or of being obliged to amputate in con&s;equence of a great di&s;|charge: But I have never yet &s;een the di&s;charge in com|pound fractures productive of either of the&s;e con&s;equences; and I have been al&s;o a&s;&s;ured by &s;everal Surgeons of long experience, that they have never lo&s;t a patient, or taken off a limb on this account.</NOTE> &s;o great as
<PB N="39" REF="45">to exhau&s;t the patient, who is almo&s;t al|ways out of danger, by proper manage|ment, in ten or twelve weeks time. Nor do I believe there ever was a compound fracture which would not bear pre&s;&s;ure with advantage, if properly managed, and properly timed; and I am fully per&s;uaded, a clever recovery in a bad ca&s;e, without it, mu&s;t be merely accidental. But, on the other hand, no remedy is capable of doing more mi&s;chief, if injudiciou&s;ly u&s;ed; for if the pre&s;&s;ure is not made with the nice&s;t judgment, it retards dige&s;tion, confines matter, brings on inflammation, with pain, and all their con&s;equences. It can, there|fore, only be made with advantage by tho&s;e, who are become handy in this bu|&s;ine&s;s by u&s;e, and are capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing, from the &s;tate of the affected part, when pre&s;&s;ure, and what degree, is nece&s;&s;ary; for it is as much impo&s;&s;ible to apply it with propriety, from de&s;crip|tion, as to play upon the HARPSICHORD without ever having learnt upon that in|&s;trument.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, &s;o far as I can judge of this matter, immediate amputation in
<PB N="40" REF="46">compound fractures ought not to take place, where the joints have not &s;uffered violently by the injury, unle&s;s the mu&s;cles and tendons are &s;o cru&s;hed, or otherways de&s;troyed, as to make putrefaction not <HI>a probable,</HI> but an inevitable con&s;equence: And it evidently appears from the anato|my of the part, that when the mortified fle&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is dige&s;ted off, the limb cannot be made u&s;eful; and even when the joints have received con&s;iderable injury, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of immediate amputation will de|pend upon particular circum&s;tances; for if only part of the ligaments are torn, and the fractured head of the bone can be ta|ken away, the patient may often be cured, &s;o as to have a tolerable good limb: But if the greate&s;t part of the ligaments con|necting the joint are &s;poiled, there cannot be any hopes of making a good cure; and, in &s;uch ca&s;es, by deferring amputation, we lo&s;e time, omit a good opportunity of per|forming it, while the parts are uninflamed, and &s;uffer the patient to undergo unnece&s;|&s;ary pain from the &s;ub&s;equent inflamma|tion, <HI>without any pro&s;pect of future advan|tage</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. FAURE is of a different opinion, which &s;ee, with the arguments of Mr. BOUCHER.

<P>But my connections with tho&s;e of my profe&s;&s;ion have not only led me to know the &s;ucce&s;s of many Surgeons, who&s;e &s;itua|tion affords them only common accidents; but al&s;o of &s;everal, who, as well as my|&s;elf, have had the care of the workmen in Collieries, Lime-kilns, Lead-mines, and the like, where the mo&s;t violent injuries of this kind frequently happen. In the&s;e places, the bones are, for the mo&s;t part, not only broken into many pieces, and their extremities, now and then, &s;epara|ted, &s;o as to come away; but they are al&s;o often forced into the ground, the principal arteries &s;ometimes divided, and the mu&s;|cles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are frequently lacerated, and cru&s;hed with immen&s;e weights, even &s;o much, that coal &s;leck, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in great quan|tities, is driven into the very &s;ub&s;tance of the fle&s;h, &s;o as to render the accident as formidable as po&s;&s;ible; and yet, it is a no|torious fact, that, where the part is not ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, the&s;e de&s;perate ca&s;es &s;eldom fail of being cured, without the lo&s;s of the limb: From all which I am induced to think, that notwith&s;tanding <HI>&s;peedy amputation</HI> may be nece&s;&s;ary and right in great ho&s;pitals, yet this ought to be no precedent for country practice, which certainly points out, that much more may be expected from the re&s;ources of nature,
<PB N="42" REF="48">than &s;ome imagine; becau&s;e the e&s;capes with life and limb are not very rare, but mo&s;t frequently happen. You &s;ee Mr. GOOCH, who has wrote well on this &s;ub|ject, is not in general for &s;peedy amputa|tion; and I am certain you will have much more &s;atisfaction, and acquire more repu|tation by the di&s;cerning part of mankind, in pre&s;erving a limb, than in taking it off.</P>
<P>I know, indeed, Operations often make a great noi&s;e, and prejudice people in fa|vour of the abilities of the Operator; and &s;ome, with very little knowledge in Sur|gery, have rai&s;ed them&s;elves great reputa|tion by this mechanical part of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, which requires no great genius, as it depends only upon a knowledge of ana|tomy, and a practical dexterity of the hand: For do not young Surgeons, of no great abilities, after &s;ome trials upon dead bodies, perform operations with the great|e&s;t &s;ucce&s;s? And you &s;ee, the nice&s;t ope|rations are daily performed by illiterate men upon brute animals, with a dexterity that cannot be excelled by tho&s;e, who un|thinkingly dre&s;s them&s;elves in a mo&s;t for|midable habit, when they perform opera|tions on the human &s;ubject.

<P>Neverthele&s;s, notwith&s;tanding this part of practice is &s;o readily acquired, it has of late years been more attended to by the &s;tudent, and cultivated with more a&s;&s;i|duity, than the treatment of Fractures, Luxations, Wounds, Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, Ulcers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. POTT, in the Preface to his Treati&s;e on the Fi&s;tula Lachrymalis, ob&s;erves, <Q>That the operative part of Surgery is the great, and <HI>almo&s;t only object,</HI> which they who come to the Ho&s;pital have in view, becau&s;e it is what they have &s;een the lea&s;t of.</Q> And it may be added, that above half the young fellows that have attended dur|ing Mr. POTT'S time, were bred Apothecaries, and had &s;een little or nothing of Surgery, when they arrived in London.

It is true, indeed, Mr. POTT has, in the &s;ame place, very properly recommended greater attention to the com|mon practice of Surgery; and he has done much, in his &s;everal writings, towards bringing this part of the art to perfection: But, if I am well informed, operations &s;till en|gro&s;s chiefly the minds of many of tho&s;e, who attend the Ho&s;pital for improvement.</NOTE>; and an able writer upon Opera|tions, &s;ome years &s;ince, overlooked the&s;e articles, becau&s;e he thought the method of treating them was &s;ettled. The book Mr. POTT has now wrote, &s;hews there was &s;till room for improvement in the cure of fractures, and di&s;locations; and a little re|flection
<PB N="44" REF="50">would have di&s;covered, that the treatment of Ulcers was not arrived at its <HI>ne plus ultra:</HI> And indeed, I am fearful the &s;tudy of that part of Surgery, which is mo&s;t common, has been neglected, &s;ince the &s;pirit of performing <HI>capital</HI> operations has &s;o much taken place.</P>
<P>The&s;e things I mention to you, with an intent to &s;timulate you to apply your mind to the common<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">By the common practice of Surgery, I would be un|der&s;tood to mean that part which cures without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the knife, except the opening of ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, &s;inus's, and the like.</NOTE> practice of Surgery; and I make not any doubt, if this part of the profe&s;&s;ion is duly attended to, there will &s;oon be a decrea&s;e in the number of <HI>capital</HI> operations.

<P>NOTHING is of greater u&s;e in Surgery, than a&s;certaining the principles upon which we are to act, as it leads us out of uncertainty, and directs us to proceed with every advantage to the patient. What Mr. POTT, therefore, &s;ays on Di&s;locations, de&s;erves your greate&s;t attention; as it is de&s;ignedly wrote to a&s;certain the principles upon which their reduction depends. An improvement much wanted, as they &s;eem not hitherto to have been generally under|&s;tood, or fully con&s;idered, by any writer.</P>
<P>Indeed, it cannot be &s;aid, that he is the fir&s;t who pointed out, that great exten&s;ion was wrong, and that the mu&s;cles ought to be put into a &s;tate of non-re&s;i&s;tance, in or|der to reduce a di&s;located bone, with pro|priety and ea&s;e; as you will &s;ee, if you examine Mr. THOMPSON'S Paper, in the &s;econd volume of the London Medical Ob|&s;ervations and Inquiries; but he is the
<PB N="48" REF="54">fir&s;t, who has con&s;idered the non-re&s;i&s;tant &s;tate of the mu&s;cles as a general principle, and has endeavoured to prove, that the difficulty attending the reduction of every kind of di&s;location, is wholly owing to the re&s;i&s;tance of the mu&s;cles, and ten|dons, attached to, and connected with the bones compo&s;ing the joint. Whereas Mr. THOMPSON imagines, that one cau&s;e of difficulty is from the head of the bone not being able to get readily back thro' the opening, which, he thinks, it always makes in the Cap&s;ular Ligament; for, in di&s;&s;ect|ing the arm of a man, who had a di&s;loca|ted &s;houlder at the time he died, it was found, on the &s;econd day of enquiry, that this ligament was torn off from the neck of the humerus; in which notion, he has the &s;anction of PETIT, who forty years ago was of the &s;ame opinion<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">He advi&s;es to make the di&s;located bone re-enter its cavity by the way it was forced out, becau&s;e it leads to the <HI>opening in the Sacculus Ligamento&s;us,</HI> which has been made by the eruption of the <HI>head of the bone.</HI> Otherwi&s;e, com|ing to its cavity by a new way, and finding no aperture in the ligamentary Tunicle, it carries it along with it into its &s;ocket, which hinders the reduction being exact, &amp;c. Des Malad. des Of. p. 46. tom. i. or Med. Ob&s;. and Inq. vol. ii. See Note to p. 356.</NOTE>; and from con&s;idering the anatomy of the joints, and from experiments made upon dead
<PB N="49" REF="55">bodies, we find the &s;ame &s;entiments &s;ince adopted by Dr. HUNTER<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Med. Comment. p. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This doctrine, you &s;ee, Mr. POTT has con&s;idered; his arguments about it have weight; and, &s;o far as I can judge from ex|perience, I believe, if the advice of GALEN, which has been copied by almo&s;t every wri|ter, of <Q><HI>returning the di&s;located bone the &s;ame way in which it was di&s;placed,</HI></Q> is followed, you will, in recent di&s;locations, never meet with any ob&s;tacle from the Ligament, if care is taken, that the mu&s;cles do not make re&s;i&s;tance to the reduction.</P>
<P>If you look back into the writers on Surgery, you will find the be&s;t of them advi&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, the practice of reducing di&s;located bones by the hand, without much exten&s;ion; and where exten&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary, when it is properly made, they direct the bone to be conducted into its place in the &s;ame manner. They mu&s;t mean, when it is not in&s;tantly replaced by the mu&s;cles upon coming near to the ca|vity into which it is to enter: And it will be worth your while to con&s;ider, whether this part of practice &s;hould not occa&s;ionally be continued, even when we proceed upon Mr. POTT'S principles.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="56">
<P>Mr. Serjeant WISEMAN copied the practice of <Q>reducing di&s;locations of the thigh, in young patients, of tender con|&s;titutions, by laying one hand upon the thigh, and the other on the leg, and having &s;omewhat extended it towards the &s;ound leg, the knee mu&s;t be &s;ud|denly forced up towards the belly, and the head of the femur pre&s;&s;ed into its <HI>acetabulum</HI> and it will knap in.</Q> For (he &s;ays) <Q>there is no need of &s;o great exten&s;ion in this kind of luxation, for the mo&s;t con&s;iderable mu&s;cles being up|on the &s;tretch, <HI>the bowing of the knee as afore&s;aid</HI> reduceth it.</Q></P>
<P>You will readily recollect, that Mr. TRAVIS of Scarborough, about twelve years ago, reduced a thigh which was di&s;|located inwards towards the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> of the <HI>pubis,</HI> by <Q>fixing his patient upon his back upon a bed, with his heel again&s;t a high rai&s;ed bed&s;tead, where he had &s;ufficient foot-hold, and the exten&s;ion was made by three men, with a towel fixed above the knee upon a napkin folded and rolled on to prevent the &s;kin from being chafed. The patient's, right knee was bent &s;o as the leg made about a right angle with the thigh; and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant was placed on his knees upon

<P>About twenty-eight years ago I &s;aw Mr. HOLBROOKE reduce a di&s;located thigh in a hearty young fellow, about twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, much in the &s;ame manner, except that the exten|&s;ion was made by pulling at the ancle, as well as at a cloth fixed above the knee.&mdash; A Gentleman, bred up to Surgery, living in the &s;ame town, was fir&s;t called in; who
<PB N="52" REF="58">&s;oon di&s;covered the nature of the accident; but having declined every part of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, except midwifery, and not having before &s;een a di&s;located thigh, he directly &s;ent for Mr. HOLBROOKE, in who&s;e ab|&s;ence it fell to my &s;hare to attend; but be|fore I &s;et out, I thought proper to look what had been &s;aid about an accident I had never &s;een, and had the misfortune to take down TURNER, who &s;eems to have copied from WISEMAN; but has omitted the material circum&s;tance of making his exten&s;ion towards the &s;ound leg, and pu&s;h|ing the knee up in the &s;ame direction. When I came to the patient, the <HI>round head</HI> of the bone in the groin near to the foramen ovale, and a cavity where the great trochanter ought to have been, at once di&s;covered what was the matter; and we therefore &s;et about reducing the di&s;location in the manner Dr. TUR|NER directs<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Surgery, vol. ii. p. 343.</NOTE>: But after repeated at|tempts without &s;ucce&s;s, we tried whether the &s;trap would a&s;&s;i&s;t, by one pulling on the out&s;ide the thigh, while the other pu&s;hed upon the head of the bone; but this did not help us; and &s;eeing we were not likely to accompli&s;h the work we had
<PB N="53" REF="59">undertaken, I di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger away for my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Being come, he made the exten&s;ion in the manner we had already done; but he placed him&s;elf betwixt the patient's legs, with both his hands upon the out&s;ide of the man's knee, and one of his own knees was fixed again&s;t the upper part of the thigh bone; and when he thought the ex|ten&s;ion was &s;ufficiently made, he at the &s;ame in&s;tant (as the patient lay upon a bed rather below him) pu&s;hed the femur down|ward, and outward, and pulled the knee inward; by which means the head of the bone went directly, with a con&s;iderable &s;nap, into its place: &mdash; So that in all the&s;e ca&s;es the reduction was finally accom|pli&s;hed by making a lever of the thigh bone.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, a child, about &s;ix years of age, was brought into my Sur|gery, on account of its having received by a fall, an injury in its hip; and upon in|quiry, I found the upper part of the thigh bone intirely at liberty, and under the edge of the gluteus mu&s;cle. Upon which, I of cour&s;e &s;et about examining, whether the head of the bone was di&s;located, or broken off at its neck; for which purpo&s;e, I di|rected (as the child lay upon a woman's
<PB N="54" REF="60">lap) the thigh to be put into a &s;tate of flexion, then extended by pulling <HI>gently</HI> at the knee, and moved from &s;ide to &s;ide, keeping my own hand upon the greater trochanter, which I could plainly perceive; but luckily, at the very fir&s;t of our making the&s;e motions, while I was pre&s;&s;ing upon the bone, it &s;lipped from under my hand into its place; &s;o that we cured the pa|tient, and learnt the nature of the acci|dent, both at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar ca&s;e lately fell under my no|tice. A lad, about twelve or fourteen years of age, was thrown from a hor&s;e, and &s;ome bags of flour fell upon his hip; from which accident that leg and thigh were rendered u&s;ele&s;s. The Surgeon, who was fir&s;t called, attended him &s;everal days; and the hip being &s;welled from the brui&s;e, he hone&s;tly told the friends of the boy, that he could not tell with certainty, what was the matter: Upon which I was called in. I fir&s;t &s;aw him in bed, and ob&s;erved, as &s;oon as the bed-cloaths were removed, that the knee of the injured thigh lay over the middle of the &s;ound thigh, in a loo&s;e, aukward manner; and upon taking hold of the knee, I plainly di&s;covered, that the upper part of the bone was at liberty un|der the gluteus mu&s;cles; but whether it
<PB N="55" REF="61">was di&s;located, or broken, we could not yet tell. We therefore placed him upon a table, to make our proper inquiries; but in moving the thigh, as in the la&s;t ca&s;e, I felt the bone &s;lip from under my hand, the hip and thigh became perfectly right, and the patient from this time began to recover the compleat u&s;e of his leg, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it is plain, that a di&s;located thigh may mo&s;t ea&s;ily be reduced in a &s;tate of flexion; and though the&s;e were only young people, yet it is probable, that tho&s;e far|ther advanced in years may be cured in the &s;ame manner, by only making a &s;tron|ger exten&s;ion. CELSUS, PAREY, WISE|MAN, and many others, reduced thighs in this &s;tate, notwith&s;tanding their exten|&s;ion was made in a &s;trait line; but unle&s;s they took great care to keep down the head of the bone, when they pu&s;hed up the knee, the bone would return to the place from whence it was drawn, and pre|vent the reduction; which inconvenience will be avoided, if the thigh is bent at the time exten&s;ion is made. May not we, therefore, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, from the ca&s;es we have mentioned, and from what Mr. POTT has &s;aid upon this &s;ub|ject, &s;elect a practice that will effectually &s;erve our purpo&s;e, whenever the accident
<PB N="56" REF="62">immediately under con&s;ideration requires our a&s;&s;i&s;tance?</P>
<P>When a thigh is di&s;located, inward, or outward, perhaps it will be be&s;t to follow the advice of CELSUS, in laying the pa|tient on one &s;ide, &s;o that the part into which the bone has &s;lipped, be always up|permo&s;t, and that from which it has re|ceded, lowermo&s;t; by which means the exten&s;ion may be made in any direction you have a mind, and your own invention will point out to you twenty ways of &s;e|curing the patient upon <HI>a bed,</HI> (for a table will be too high,) &s;o that a proper re&s;i&s;t|ance may be made to the exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>This being done, the knee bent, and a towel fixed properly above it, you mu&s;t place your&s;elf on that &s;ide of the thigh, to which the bone is di&s;located, with your knee near to the head of the bone, and both hands on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the knee of the patient, an a&s;&s;i&s;tant being fixed at the ancle. The exten&s;ion may then gradually be begun, by three or four men, with the thigh rather in a &s;tate of flexion; and when there is rea&s;on to think, that the head of the bone is drawn upon a level with the &s;ocket, the exten&s;ion being &s;tea|dily continued, the knee may be bent
<PB N="57" REF="63">nearer to the abdomen, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, while your knee pu&s;hes the bone towards its place, the ancle mu&s;t be mo|ved in the &s;ame, but the knee of the pa|tient in a contrary direction; by which means, I imagine, the bone will, in ge|neral, be replaced, provided the exten&s;ion is &s;ufficiently made, before we attempt to return it into its &s;ocket.</P>
<P>I think it is generally allowed, that di&s;|locations of the thigh rarely happen other|wi&s;e than inward or outward, though wri|ters al&s;o talk of its being di&s;located up|wards and downwards; but when we call to mind, how &s;eldom this accident in any way is met with, it will appear, that our a&s;&s;i&s;tance may perhaps never once be re|quired to reduce di&s;locations of the thigh, thus circum&s;tanced; and it may be much que&s;tioned, whether Surgeons have not copied this account from one another, without ever once having &s;een this acci|dent; for HIPPOCRATES fir&s;t &s;tarted the opinion, perhaps, from <HI>imagining</HI> there was a po&s;&s;ibility of its happening in the&s;e dif|ferent directions: And I &s;ee it has been handed down, by almo&s;t every writer, in <HI>his very words.</HI></P>
<PB N="58" REF="64">
<P>However, if the di&s;location upwards or downwards does ever happen, I imagine you will not be at any great lo&s;s about the reduction, if the &s;ame plan as we have ju&s;t laid down is pur&s;ued; except that exten|&s;ion mu&s;t at fir&s;t be made with the thigh in a &s;trait line; and it &s;eems mo&s;t proper to place the patient, as PAREY advi&s;es<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">HIPPOCRATES advi&s;ed the patient, in the&s;e ca&s;es, to be laid either prone or &s;upine; and mo&s;t of the writers, except PAREY, have copied him, from one another, very exactly. But by placing the patient in the &s;ide po&s;ition, you have not only the advantage of u&s;ing your knee, but the exten&s;ion can be continued, while the thigh is brought into a &s;tate of flexion; and the per&s;on at the ancle can a&s;&s;i&s;t you much, by pulling backward, or pu&s;hing forward, the bent knee, and turning the ancle as the ca&s;e requires.</NOTE>, "on his &s;ound &s;ide," and of a convenient height, that the pre&s;&s;ure with your knee may be made in a &s;trait direction.</P>
<P>When the &s;houlder is di&s;located, the head of the bone, you know, often ru&s;hes into its place, when it approaches the cup of the &s;capula, even when the exten&s;ion has been made with the mu&s;cles in a &s;tate of re&s;i&s;tance; and it is rea&s;onable to be|lieve, that it will more readily happen, when this impediment is removed, by their being relaxed. Neverthele&s;s, further art will &s;ometimes, I think, be required, to conduct the bone into its place, even un|der
<PB N="59" REF="65">this advantage. Mr. THOMPSON, you &s;ee, propo&s;es, that <Q>the arm &s;hould be rai&s;ed upwards, and a little inwards, to bring it in a line of direction, centering between the tendons of the <HI>&s;ub&s;capula|ris,</HI> and <HI>teres minor</HI> mu&s;cles; both of which, and the flap of the cap&s;ular li|gament, will be relaxed by that means; the arm is to be held in that po&s;ition by one hand of the Surgeon; the infe|rior angle of the <HI>&s;capula</HI> mu&s;t then be carried backwards towards the &s;pine, and the <HI>acromion</HI> depre&s;&s;ed downwards by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. The&s;e motions will bring the head of the <HI>humerus</HI> to the out&s;ide of the brim of the glenoide ca|vity; and the Surgeon, who has hold of the patient's arm, making a gentle ex|ten&s;ion upwards, and pa&s;&s;ing the thumb or fingers of his other hand into the <HI>axilla,</HI> and there pre&s;&s;ing upon the head of the <HI>humerus,</HI> by way of fulcrum, de|pre&s;&s;es the arm with a quick motion, in a line of direction, as before mentioned. Thus the reduction, I apprehend, will mo&s;t likely take place, by the head &s;lip|ping over the flap of the cap&s;ular liga|ment, and between the two tendons into its &s;ocket.</Q></P>
<PB N="60" REF="66">
<P>I have never tried this method, be|cau&s;e, in the &s;pace of twenty years, though I have u&s;ed nothing but the napkin and ball, I have not, in recent di&s;locations of the humerus, been once di&s;appointed in my fir&s;t attempt to reduce them, when the head of the bone has lodged in the axilla: though ever &s;ince I read Mr. THOMPSON'S Paper, I have made my exten&s;ion with the fore arm bent, which is &s;upported either by the patient him&s;elf, or a &s;tander-by. I place the patient upon a cu&s;hion on the floor, and fix him, by proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that his body cannot give way to the ex|ten&s;ion. Having put the arm through a napkin tied together in the common man|ner, and betwixt my thighs; I put the napkin over my neck, and fix a linen or a woollen ball in the middle of the napkin, &s;o that it cannot move. This ball is three times as large as tho&s;e commonly u&s;ed, of &s;ufficient hardne&s;s to make a re&s;i&s;tance to the head of the bone, and yet &s;oft enough to pre&s;s into the axilla. The proce&s;&s;us a|cromium is left intirely at liberty, and when three or four men (who, by &s;itting upon the bare floor, are rather lower than the patient) have by a towel, tied, with the u&s;ual cautions, above the elbow, drawn the head of the bone forward enough, in
<PB N="61" REF="67">a direction that keeps it about the middle of the axilla; I pre&s;s the ball in behind it, and by leaning backwards, <HI>in&s;tead of for|cing the head of the bone again&s;t the neck of the &s;capula,</HI> I pu&s;h it outwards, &s;o as to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, who make the exten&s;ion, till I find it arrived at the edge of the gle|noide cavity, when I direct the elbow to be brought nearer to the &s;ide, and at the &s;ame time rai&s;e my&s;elf more perpendicu|lar, by which means the head of the hu|merus rai&s;es the proce&s;&s;us acromium a lit|tle, and &s;lips up; immediately upon which I pu&s;h the acromium down again, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, though it is &s;eldom required. Af|terwards I move the arm in all directions, that the long tendon of the biceps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may again return to their u&s;ual place.</P>
<P>You will readily &s;ee, from this account, that the arm is drawn rather downwards; which, according to the opinion of &s;ome, is an improper po&s;ition; for they &s;ay, if the exten&s;ion is made in an horizontal direction, or downwards, <Q>as the head of the humerus will pre&s;s upon one or other of the tendons of the &s;ub&s;capula|ris or teres minor mu&s;cles, if the exten|&s;ion be forwards or backwards; and if it be in the middle, it will be oppo&s;ed by the united force of both tendons, and
<PB N="62" REF="68">of the &s;tretched cap&s;ular ligament, &s;o as to render the reduction impracticable without a further laceration.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, in regard to an horizontal po|&s;ition of the arm, I can ea&s;ily believe it improper, when the bone is di&s;located downwards; but I a&s;&s;ure you; the method of reduction ju&s;t mentioned, has always been attended with the greate&s;t ea&s;e both to my&s;elf and patient, be&s;ides a compleat recovery; and believe me, one grain of matter of fact, to a practical Surgeon, is worth a pound of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome few times &s;een the head of the humerus under the pectoral mu&s;cle; but in making the exten&s;ion, and moving the arm inward, it &s;lipped into the axilla, and was then reduced in the common manner. I have oftener &s;een the head of the bone di&s;located backwards towards the &s;capula. I remember being called to a ca&s;e of this kind in a hard working fel|low, betwixt twenty and thirty years of age, many years ago. After di&s;covering the nature of the accident, I placed the patient in a chair, and ordered the exten|&s;ion to be made with the arm in an hori|zontal po&s;ture, which I a&s;&s;i&s;ted by pu&s;h|ing with my own hand the head of the
<PB N="63" REF="69">bone towards its place: but though we brought it near to the glenoide cavity of the &s;capula, yet the&s;e &s;teps alone could not replace it. I therefore kept my hand fixed upon the head of the bone, that it &s;hould not recede, in which I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;teady exten&s;ion at the elbow, which I directed to be bent, and to be pulled backward at the &s;ame in&s;tant that the hand was turned a little upwards; upon which the bone was immediately reduced. And I have &s;ince had the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances; but I took the management of the fore arm to my|&s;elf, and got an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to pu&s;h at the head of the bone.</P>
<P>If you call to mind, you will remem|ber that a di&s;location of the under jaw is put to rights by extending the jaw for|ward, pre&s;&s;ing down the po&s;terior part of it, and at the &s;ame time pu&s;hing the ante|rior part upward. The elbow, when di&s;|located, is reduced by making an exten|&s;ion, till the fore-arm can be put into a &s;tate of flexion, and then it is ea&s;ily ac|compli&s;hed, by bearing upon the lower end of the humerus with one hand, and by taking hold of the wri&s;t, and bending the elbow with the other: and if it is on either &s;ide, the hand of the patient mu&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="70">be turned inward or outward, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, as the ca&s;e requires. Nearly the &s;ame &s;teps are taken with the knee or an|cle, when out of joint, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From all which we may conclude, with CELSUS, that <Q>whatever be the &s;pecies of di&s;lo|cation the method of reduction is the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>In di&s;locations of long &s;tanding, we find the head of the bone forms for it&s;elf a new &s;ocket<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Med. Ob&s;. and Inq. vol. ii. p. 351. Ca&s;e 2.</NOTE>; which, with the growing together of the lacerated with the neigh|bouring parts, in &s;ome ca&s;es, and the con|traction of the tendons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in others, is probably the rea&s;on why they are reduced with difficulty, or that reduction is im|practicable<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Dr. HUNTER'S Med. Comment, part i. pag. 60. Note.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The method of reduction Mr. WHITE recommends, of &s;u&s;pending the body by the arm, &s;eems the mo&s;t likely to over|come this ob&s;tacle: Though my&s;elf, and another Surgeon of much experience, u&s;ed it without effect, with every other method we could think of, in an old di&s;location, where the os humeri had &s;lipped back|wards towards the &s;capula. Perhaps the
<PB N="65" REF="71">ca&s;e was incurable; for the &s;ame Gentle|man tried it where the bone had been a month under the pectoral mu&s;cle with &s;uc|ce&s;s; and another Surgeon has &s;ince in|formed me of his moving the head of the humerus, by this method, from under the pectoral mu&s;cle, where it had lain &s;ome time, into the axilla.</P>
<P>It was a common practice, both with HIPPOCRATES and GALEN, to reduce di&s;located thighs by tying ligatures about the ancles and knees, and &s;u&s;pending the patient with his heels towards the top of the room; but remember, whenever this mode of reduction in the &s;houlder is pur|&s;ued, above the elbow is the part upon which the &s;u&s;pending ligature &s;hould alone be fixed.</P>
<P>By this time, I imagine, you heartily repent a&s;king my opinion about the&s;e mat|ters; but as one link of a chain draws on another; &s;o I have been led to &s;ay more upon this &s;ubject than I fir&s;t intended; though I imagine joining practice to the|ory will always be acceptable to a young Surgeon. If the method of reducing a di&s;located thigh had been clearly laid down, the Surgeons at the<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Ed. E&s;&s;. &amp; Ob&s;erv. vol. ii. p. 317.</NOTE> Worce&s;ter
<PB N="66" REF="72">Infirmary could not have been at a lo&s;s, in what manner to have relieved this ac|cident; and you &s;ee, at la&s;t, they were forced to have recour&s;e to the vis percu&s;|&s;ionis, which I would chu&s;e to tran&s;late, "Reduction <HI>at random.</HI>"</P>
<P>If you take a view of the chirurgical writers in regard to di&s;locations, you will find they have chiefly copied what HIP|POCRATES has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, and that much the greate&s;t part of the im|provements which have been made, till within the&s;e few years, has been in an al|teration of, or an addition to, the ma|chines he &s;ometimes u&s;ed in reducing them, which was certainly improving the wor&s;t part of his practice. He gave us the dif|ferent methods, that were employed in his time, &s;ome of which have been copied by one writer, and &s;ome by another; and they have been handed down to us, as the work of different men, by the idle cu&s;tom of every one implicitly copying a favourite author: Whereas, had they collected only the mo&s;t eligible practice from HIPPO|CRATES, together with the few real im|provements made by other writers, I think they might have deduced a rational me|thod of cure. For they might have learn|ed, that the di&s;location &s;hould be reduced
<PB N="67" REF="73">as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that the exten&s;ion &s;hould be gentle, gradual, and continued till the di&s;located bone is upon a level with the cavity from whence it receded, at which time, if it did not return of it&s;elf, it &s;hould be reduced the &s;ame way, in which it was di&s;placed; or, as CELSUS has it, <Q>from that &s;ide in which it was prolap&s;ed, to the contrary, by pre&s;&s;ing upon the head, and making a lever of the di&s;located bone.</Q> PAREY expre&s;sly &s;ays, you &s;hould not fa&s;ten the ligature to the wri&s;t in a di&s;location of the &s;houlder, or to the ancle in a di&s;location of the thigh bone; but above the elbow, or a|bove the knee; otherwi&s;e the joint of the elbow, or of the knee, will be more ex|tended than the &s;houlder or hip. The ex|ten&s;ion in di&s;locations of the&s;e parts, was, in the days of HIPPOCRATES and GA|LEN, often made with the fore arm, and knee bent; and it evidently appears, from the practice of every writer, (and, I &s;hould imagine, from every man's own experi|ence,) that, whenever a di&s;located limb was reduced, both with ea&s;e to the patient and his Surgeon, the mu&s;cles were in a &s;tate of flexion. But the rea&s;on the&s;e were not &s;elected from the injudicious parts of practice, &s;eems to be, becau&s;e the princi|ples,
<PB N="68" REF="74">upon which we ought to proceed, were not a&s;certained. But from ob&s;erving Mr. POTT'S doctrine in pre&s;erving the mu&s;|cles in a &s;tate of non-re&s;i&s;tance, by the po|&s;ition of the limb, and by retaining the practice of conducting the head of the di&s;|located bone into its place, I apprehend we &s;hall make choice of that method which will relieve our patients with cer|tainty and ea&s;e.</P>

<P>I De&s;ignedly omitted &s;aying any thing on the u&s;e of Fomentations, Catapla&s;ms, and the like, previous to reduction, where the part is much &s;welled; and on the treatment nece&s;&s;ary after the joint is re|placed; becau&s;e the&s;e are &s;ufficiently taken notice of by almo&s;t every writer upon this &s;ubject. But it may not, perhaps, be im|proper to add &s;omething to what Mr. POTT has &s;aid upon compound di&s;loca|tions; for he only tells us, (&s;peaking of the di&s;location of the Tibia at the an|cle
<PB N="69" REF="75"><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Page 62.</NOTE>, that <Q>when this accident is ac|companied, as it &s;ometimes is, with a wound of the integuments of the inner ancle, and that made by the protru&s;ion of the bone, it not infrequently ends in a fatal gangrene, unle&s;s prevented by timely amputation; though I have &s;e|veral times &s;een it do well without.</Q> Whence, as you have not yet acquired equal knowledge with this writer, you may perhaps be at a lo&s;s to know, whether, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, you ought immediately to take off the ancle, or to attempt the cure, with|out this operation.</P>
<P>Now, a Gangrene may more frequently follow a laceration of the Ligaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> connecting the joints, than other parts: becau&s;e the inflammation attending the&s;e accidents often ri&s;es higher, is more ob&s;ti|nate, and of longer continuance; but this is only local; and what we have already &s;aid about amputation, on account of gan|grenes, holds equally good here, except, that it will be more frequently nece&s;&s;ary, in local mortifications of the joints, on ac|count of the ligaments being de&s;troyed. But if I may judge from what I have &s;een,
<PB N="70" REF="76">I do believe, if the inflammation is pro|perly treated, it will, for the mo&s;t part, be prevented from terminating in what is properly called a Gangrene.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I am clearly of opinion, with Mr. GOOCH, that compound di&s;lo|cations are, in general, of wor&s;e con&s;e|quence than compound fractures, if the cure is attempted by replacing the di&s;lo|cated bone; not only on account of the ob&s;tinate ob&s;truction and inflammation, owing to the compact &s;tructure of the in|jured parts, and to the di&s;&s;olution of the ligaments, which of cour&s;e follows; but al&s;o, becau&s;e the air, having admittance into the joint, renders the Synovia acrid, which, where it is not freely di&s;charged, inflames and corrupts the ligaments, pro|duces ab&s;ce&s;&s;es about the joint, a caries of the ends of the bone, intolerable pain, a great di&s;charge, and a colliquative fever in con&s;equence of an ab&s;orption of matter: and when things are coming to this pa&s;s, life can <HI>often</HI> only be pre&s;erved by a time|ly amputation. Or if the &s;ymptoms are not &s;o violent as to require immediate am|putation, a fi&s;tula of the joint is commonly the con&s;equence, and the patient after|wards drags on, for a long time at lea&s;t, a mi&s;erable life.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="77">
<P>But I ob&s;erve, when the wound is &s;o fortunately circum&s;tanced that the ichor and matter do not lodge in the joint, but readily drain away, the &s;ymptoms are much le&s;s &s;evere, and a cure happily en|&s;ues: and le&s;s di&s;turbance, and a cure &s;till more readily follows, if the protruding bone can be taken away; for by this means the matter has a free exit, new fle&s;h more ea&s;ily ri&s;es in the &s;ore; and the new callus takes upon it the form of a joint, from the impre&s;&s;ion made by the head of that bone which remains intire.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of ha&s;tily taking off the limb, when the head of the di&s;located bone protrudes through a wound, I would advi&s;e the practice Mr. GOOCH recom|mends, of &s;awing the bone off, which may be ea&s;ily done, as it is rather &s;pongy. &mdash; A tall, boney, mu&s;cular man, forty-nine years of age, was, on the 21&s;t day of July la&s;t, thrown off from a waggon load of hay, and great part of the load falling up|on him, he was almo&s;t cru&s;hed double, at the &s;ame time that the Fibula of his left leg was broken, and the Tibia di&s;located, and forced out more than two inches, thro' a large wound of the teguments of the inner ancle.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="78">
<P>He was immediately bled by tho&s;e pre|&s;ent; but the protruding bone remained unaltered, till I &s;aw him, which was three hours afterwards, when I readily took it off with a &s;mall &s;aw. The knee was then bent, and the leg laid on one &s;ide with a declivity, that the matter, which was here|after to be formed, might be readily di&s;|charged. The wound was dre&s;&s;ed with <HI>a mild dige&s;tive bal&s;am,</HI> and the other appli|cations and bandage u&s;ed in compound fractures, and an ounce of Glauber &s;alts were immediately given, on account of the brui&s;e in his brea&s;t. Next day I found the patient ea&s;y, and the wound in a good &s;tate, dige&s;tion &s;oon afterwards appeared, the di&s;charge has &s;ince been incon&s;idera|ble, the void &s;pace filled up with new fle&s;h, which has already acquired a boney con&s;i&s;tence, and, in &s;hort, the cure has gone on without interruption, and with very little trouble to the patient, further than what was occa&s;ioned by his leg be|ing once moved (from our being unpro|vided with a proper apparatus at the be|ginning;) and there is not any doubt but he will have as u&s;eful a leg, as he had be|fore the accident happened.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="79">
<P>Indeed the ea&s;e, with which this pa|tient has recovered, and the good &s;ucce&s;s I have &s;een, where the head of the bone has been broken off, &s;o as to come away; together with the ca&s;es Mr. GOOCH has given us, induces me warmly to recom|mend this practice. And I have not any doubt, but, upon trial, it will be found to be one of tho&s;e experiments, that will re|commend it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may &s;eem &s;trange to you, that I &s;o freely u&s;ed grea&s;y applications in wounds of the ligaments; as they have in this ca&s;e been decried by almo&s;t every wri|ter, &s;ince CELSUS: And more e&s;pecially, as the Oil of Turpentine is &s;till u&s;ed and recommended by very eminent men, both in this and other nations, as a &s;pecific in wounds of the Tendons and Ligmanets, becau&s;e it is an old practice.</P>
<P>But I am apprehen&s;ive the u&s;e of Oil of Turpentine in the&s;e ca&s;es is very perni|cious; for I do believe, it has not in|frequently, by irritating and inflaming, brought on ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, and mortifications, which were thought to be in con&s;equence of the accident alone. I know an emi|nent writer &s;ays, <Q>Oil of Turpentine has the virtue of allaying pain, ari&s;ing from

It would give me plea&s;ure to explain this point farther; for a di&s;|&s;ertation on wounds of the nerves, and wounds of the ten|dons (beginning <HI>de novo</HI>) is much wanted; but as I am fearful of tiring you, &s;hall at pre&s;ent omit what has occur|red to me on this head.</NOTE>, we are informed, that his principal aim in the cure of wounded nerves, was to guard a|gain&s;t putrefaction. &mdash; <Q>Seeing, &s;ays he, (<HI>De comp. med. &s;ecund. gener.</HI> lib. 3.) that putrefaction in all things is produced by heat and moi&s;ture, I always think the

<P>WISEMAN had copied the theory about remedies of hot, dry, and &s;ubtle parts be|ing proper for wounded nerves, or ten|dons, <Q>to con&s;ume that ichorous water which fir&s;t affects them, and cau&s;eth the putrefaction;</Q> and therefore he, <Q>in the beginning, u&s;ed <HI>&s;calding oil of ro&s;es,</HI> with a little bay &s;ait di&s;&s;olved in it, and dropt into the injured part!</Q> And to mend the matter, if tumor and inflam|mation came on, he advi&s;ed the catapla&s;m made with <HI>common lixivium</HI> or wine, before taken notice of. &mdash; A procedure that can|not be reflected on without horror. And yet he afterwards relates a ca&s;e, to &s;hew the bad effects of the over u&s;e of hot oils, which he &s;ays, in the&s;e ca&s;es, have been very mi&s;chievous to many; and he cures
<PB N="86" REF="92">the patient by a &s;imple and rational method, directly contrary to that which he him&s;elf had propo&s;ed<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q>A young woman was pricked in a Tendon, by be|ing bled in the foot, and in con&s;equence of u&s;ing hot oil of turpentine the lips of the wound became turgid, dry, and inflamed. WISEMAN being called, &s;hewed the Sur|geon his <HI>error;</HI> dre&s;&s;ed with Ba&s;ilicon, an Embrocation of Oil of Ro&s;es, and with Diachylon &s;oftened with oil, which lying on two or three days, cured the patient. (Book v. cap. 3.)</Q></NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding he im|mediately afterwards mentions two ca&s;es, where he applied a bal&s;am (compo&s;ed of Euphorbium, Turpentine, Cloves, Sagape|num, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) equally hot with Oil of Tur|pentine, and which manife&s;tly did injury to both the patients on whom it was u&s;ed; there being a nece&s;&s;ity of applying fomen|tations, and emollient catapla&s;ms, to &s;ub|due the inflammation it had cau&s;ed. From all which, his own knowledge, and his paying too great a regard to authority, are at once both evident.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of PAREY; for when he <HI>thought for him&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that tho&s;e who did not embarra&s;s them&s;elves with the prevailing theory, pointed out a much better method of cure. MARCHETTI dre&s;&s;ed a tendon laid bare with <HI>dry lint;</HI> and SYDENHAM advi&s;ed an emol|lient catapla&s;in to pricked tendons.</NOTE>, no man &s;hone more in his profe&s;&s;ion: but when he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be fettered with theory, we &s;ee his practice was horrible. But we
<PB N="87" REF="93">have a recent in&s;tance in DE HAEN, how far a preconceived prejudice may bia&s;s the mind in favor of a bad remedy, in oppo&s;i|tion to matter of fact. We have already ob&s;erved, that he u&s;ed Oil of Turpentine, in imitation of PAREY, to ea&s;e pain: but he happened to meet with &s;ome ca&s;es in SCHLICHTING, which fairly prove, that this oil applied to the &s;kin cau&s;ed great pains, and dreadful inflammations: but as the &s;ame untoward &s;ymptoms did not ap|pear in the &s;ame per&s;ons from the u&s;e of Hungary water, he, in&s;tead of concluding, that the oil was more irritating than Hun|gary water, curiou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that all the mi&s;chief was owing to an Idio&s;yncra&s;y, or peculiar temper of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>TURNER al&s;o embarra&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the &s;ame theory and practice; and after bringing on inflammation with Oil of Tur|pentine, and then reducing it by emollient catapla&s;ms; he fays, <Q>Indeed, through mi&s;take it may &s;o happen, that all the&s;e fiery ex&s;iccating medicines may be per|nicious, and ha&s;ten tho&s;e very accidents, they were intended to avert. As where the injury has been &s;light, or glancing only on the aponeuro&s;is, when <HI>I have frequently &s;een a &s;mall pledget of the com|mon dige&s;tive, even a little Ba&s;ilicon ap|plied
<PB N="88" REF="94">to the fe&s;tering orifice, has made way for &s;ome unhappy &s;ymptoms to go off, without farther di&s;turbance; which had undoubtedly been aggravated by either of the foregoing dre&s;&s;ings.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, one of the be&s;t practical Surgeons in this kingdom, in a late u&s;eful publication, has adopted the old theory; for he cautions us again&s;t u&s;ing oleaginous, or cold applications, to wounds of the nerves and tendons; and &s;ays, <Q>the mo&s;t &s;uitable applications to the nervous, or tendinous part it&s;elf, are tho&s;e of a &s;ub|tle, &s;pirituous nature; &s;uch as Sp. Te|rebinth. dre&s;&s;ing the other parts of the wound with vulnerary bal&s;ams, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now if Oil of Turpentine gives pain to the fle&s;h, it cannot be proper to the nerves them&s;elves; becau&s;e they are the organs of &s;en&s;ation<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I cannot conceive, that this able Surgeon ever u&s;es Oil of Turpentine to inflamed or wounded nerves. And I wi&s;h he had not, like WISEMAN, copied the mi&s;takes of former writers.</NOTE>. And how unnece&s;&s;ary its u&s;e is in wounds of the nerves, the com|mon method of dre&s;&s;ing a limb, after am|putation, where the great nerves are wounded, fully proves. It is true, indeed, it cannot give equal pain to the tendons, when uninflamed, becau&s;e they are then
<PB N="89" REF="95">nearly in&s;en&s;ible: but it will mo&s;t certainly cri&s;p up and harden their fibres; and a &s;lough, thicker or thinner, will be &s;uper|induced. Whereas, if a tendon is only laid bare by a &s;imple wound, and dry lint is applied, its blood-ve&s;&s;els will fir&s;t: look inflamed, (like an inflamed eye,) from whence new fle&s;h will ari&s;e, and a cure will en&s;ue, without any &s;eparation; pro|vided the moi&s;ture which drains from the lips of the wound, be artfully kept from interfering by pieces of &s;ine &s;punge. But if the nature of the accident be &s;uch, that the tendinous parts will unavoidably &s;up|purate, they may be dre&s;&s;ed like other wounds; and, in this re&s;pect will termi|nate equally well, allowing only a longer time for them to &s;eparate, which they al|ways require, on account of their compact &s;tructure. So that, you &s;ee, I am recom|mending you back to the practice of CEL|SUS, who no other way guarded again&s;t the effects of cold, than by keeping off cold air. And is it not amazing, that this treatment, which would procure ea&s;e, &s;hould be overlooked, and preference given to the fiery remedies of the followers of GALEN?</P>
<P>Examine thoroughly, therefore, common|ly received opinions, before you adopt
<PB N="90" REF="96">them; whence you will be led to think for your&s;elf; which is the high road to|wards knowledge. In particular, you will find, brought down to our own times, as much ab&s;urd rea&s;oning about the nature and cure of Ulcers, and &s;ome as bad prac|tice in con&s;equence of this rea&s;oning, as any we have de&s;cribed. But I hope the mi&s;takes I have already pointed out in this Po&s;t&s;cript, will put you upon your guard again&s;t plau&s;ible and plea&s;ing Theories. And if you are de&s;irous of being e&s;teemed in your profe&s;&s;ion, remember, that <Q><HI>Wi&s;|dom li&s;teth up the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to &s;it among great men.</HI></Q></P>
