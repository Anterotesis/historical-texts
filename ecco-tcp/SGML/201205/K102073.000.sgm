<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE writing of practical Ob&s;ervations is &s;o ancient, and &s;o univer&s;ally approv'd among Phy&s;icians, that I need make no Apology for following that Method in tho&s;e I now offer to the Publick. I &s;hall only take Notice, that they come forth in the &s;ame Order as they &s;tood in my own private Journal; and there|fore, if they be mix'd with Incidents which are &s;omewhat unu&s;ual in &s;uch Performances, yet, I hope they will not prove the le&s;s beneficial, as they are, in every Re&s;pect, calculated for the Relief of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who date their <HI>Splenetick</HI> and <HI>Va|pouri&s;h</HI> Di&s;orders from the melancholy Circum&s;tan|ces of the Times, whereunto every good Phy&s;ician ought to have a &s;trict Regard, as the Impre&s;&s;ions made by &s;uch Cau&s;es may &s;ometimes require other Aids be&s;ides tho&s;e of Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>But there are other Rea&s;ons which may ju&s;tify my deviating &s;omewhat out of the common Road in this Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> The many concurring Aggra|vations which render'd tho&s;e Maladies more than or|dinarily ob&s;tinate. The Di&s;a&s;ters which happen'd to Mens Pockets fell out, unluckily, about that Sea&s;on of the Year, when above Two Thirds of the Nation
<PB REF="3">are naturally <HI>Splenetick,</HI> and when the Di&s;con|tented of all Denominations u&s;ually &s;et their Plots and Machinations on foot. It is no wonder there|fore, if the ordinary Methods can avail nothing, but that we are forced to have Recour&s;e to all the Stratagems and Arguments our Wit and Rea&s;on can afford us.</P>
<P>This is all the Apology I thought nece&s;&s;ary to make for what the Reader may find new or un|common, and I &s;hall take my Leave, by acquaint|ing him, that I intend my Ob&s;ervations, for the two following Months, &s;hall al&s;o be publi&s;h'd in a &s;hort Time, and will contain all the remaining Occur|rences that were mo&s;t remarkable in that Branch of my Practice, during the black and gloomy Sea&s;on of the Year; and I doubt not, when my Labours are once fini&s;h'd, they will have the &s;ame Effect with the mo&s;t efficacious Remedies, either to kill or cure.</P>

<HEAD>From the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> 1720. OBSERVATIONS ON THE <HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY FREEMAN,</HI> E&s;q; aged 42, and of a plethorick Habit of Body, was &s;eiz'd with a Giddine&s;s, and a Ri&s;ing in his Throat, accompany'd with Faint|ne&s;s, and many other Symptoms that at|tend Hypochondriack Di&s;orders. He told me, when I ask'd him how long he had been ill, that he had found the Di&s;temper creeping on him for above a Month, but that he was every Day grown wor&s;e than another; that the Giddine&s;s was but newly come upon him, and that he believ'd it was caus'd by a Cold he had got in <HI>Exchange-Ally</HI> the Day before, where he had waited an Opportunity to &s;ell &s;ome Stock. He told me likewi&s;e, that he had got a Pain, or rather an Unea&s;ine&s;s in his Left Side near the &s;hort Ribs; and that he believ'd it was occa&s;ion'd by a Jew who came to beat down the Price of Stocks, carry|ing a large Bag of Money, which, by rea&s;on of the Crowd, happen'd to be pre&s;s'd &s;everal times again&s;t his Side; that he had ever &s;ince then been troubled with a Faintne&s;s; and in fine, that he was &s;o bad, that he believ'd he could hardly live to another Day, unle&s;s I could find &s;ome &s;peedy Relief for him. I &s;oon perceiv'd by tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, that the Gen|tleman
<PB N="2" REF="5">had been an Adventurer in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and that all his Ailments had taken their Date from the Time the Stocks began to fall; yet, as I was unwil|ling to dive particularly into his Affairs, I only told him, that I perceiv'd he had met with &s;omething late|ly that had lain heavy upon him, which had been the Cau&s;e of all the&s;e Di&s;orders. That the Giddine&s;s, when accompany'd with a Ri&s;ing in the Throat, al|ways denoted Trouble of Mind, either from &s;ome external Cau&s;e, which is able to make too vio|lent Impre&s;&s;ions on our Imaginations, or from our own di&s;temper'd Imaginations alone. That the Pain and Heavine&s;s in his Side might al&s;o, with more Pro|bability, proceed from the &s;ame univer&s;al Cau&s;e, than from any external Injury, as it was for the mo&s;t part a concurring Symptom. I likewi&s;e took notice, that the Spirits were always &s;eiz'd and much affected in tho&s;e Di&s;orders; becau&s;e the Impre&s;&s;ions were fir&s;t made upon them. The Gentleman was fully per&s;ua|ded that I had fallen rightly upon his Di&s;temper, and began to tell me of his own accord, that he had been a con&s;iderable Lo&s;er of late, as he was one of the la&s;t Sub&s;cribers. He &s;aid, he always had a Diffidence in that great Project, and was even led into it in Com|pliance with the Multitude, tho' it was again&s;t the plain Dictates of his own Mind. After which, he ask'd me if I thought his Di&s;ea&s;e would prove mortal; for he had never been in &s;uch a Condition before. I made An&s;wer, that the Di&s;temper &s;eldom prov'd mor|tal to any but tho&s;e who gave them&s;elves wholly up to it, and would by no means arm them&s;elves again&s;t it; I therefore advis'd him to be chearful, and not to think too much of his Lo&s;&s;es, and I would order what was proper, by way of Phy&s;ick; and when I had pre|&s;crib'd him a Vomit and &s;ome Pills, with a Bottle of Cephalic Drops, I left him.</P>
<P>Next Day I found him eas'd of the wor&s;t Symp|toms, but the Heavine&s;s and Pain of his Side was not
<PB N="3" REF="6">altogether abated, and the ri&s;ing of his Throat con|tinued; he &s;eem'd al&s;o to be very melancholy; whereupon I ordered him a Liniment for his Side, and bid him continue in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Things I had already pre&s;crib'd; but above all, to arm him|&s;elf again&s;t the Di&s;turbance of his Mind, which I perceiv'd at that Time to be great; but as he was naturally a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n of Sen&s;e and Re&s;olution, he &s;oon got the better of his Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Arabella Blackham,</HI> aged 37, of a &s;anguin Complexion, but of a &s;omewhat delicate Make, was &s;uddenly &s;eized with violent Fits; but before I could get to her Lodgings, they had left her, and &s;he was faln a&s;leep. I ask'd her Woman after what Manner &s;he was taken, who made An&s;wer, that her Lady had been in a very &s;trange Condition, and had been very ill for a Month or longer, with hot Flu&s;hings in her Face, and had got &s;everal Cordials from the Apothecary, and was &s;ometimes better and &s;ome|times wor&s;e; but that &s;omething the Apothecary had &s;aid to her the Day before had lain &s;o on her Mind, and had brought her into &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch Madne&s;s, that they were not able to hold her; but &s;he tore every one that came near her, &s;ometimes laughing, and &s;ometimes cry|ing, and was but ju&s;t quieted. She &s;aid her Lady had never been well &s;ince the Fall of the Stocks, having put all Mi&s;s's Fortune into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> with an Intention to marry her to Sir <HI>John Frisk</HI>'s elde&s;t Son, who would have 20000 Pounds a Year at the Death of his Father, that &s;he had borrowed Money on all her own Plate and Jewels, excepting one Salver and a Pair of Candle&s;ticks; and that &s;he believ'd her La|dy de&s;ign'd her&s;elf to marry a Gentleman that us'd to vi&s;it her, but that the Match was broke off within this Fortnight.</P>
<P>After &s;o full an Account, I could not be at a lo&s;s how to judge of my Lady's Indi&s;po&s;ition. I told the young Woman I would wait upon her Lady in the
<PB N="4" REF="7">Morning, becau&s;e I was of Opinion &s;he would pro|bably re&s;t all Night, after &s;he had been &s;o much fa|tigu'd.</P>
<P>Next Day I call'd as &s;oon as it was proper; but the Lady was &s;omewhat frighten'd when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw me, and ask'd me if the Plague was come to <HI>London;</HI> begging, if I had been with any one that had it, not to come near her. I a&s;&s;ur'd her, <HI>London</HI> was very free from the Plague, and that &s;he needed not be under any Apprehen&s;ions. The rea&s;on of the Lady's Sur|prize, as I came to know &s;ince, was from what the Apothecary had &s;aid to her. He is accounted a ve|ry hone&s;t Man; but it &s;eems, from a De&s;ire the Lady &s;hould think him learned enough in his Profe&s;&s;ion, he told her &s;he had &s;ome bad Signs, and would be apt to have the <HI>Furor Uterinus;</HI> this being a Di&s;ea&s;e &s;he had never heard of, made her imagine it might be the new Di&s;temper that now infe&s;ts our neighbouring Kingdom.</P>
<P>After I had deliver'd the Lady out of all her Fears, I went and examin'd her Pul&s;e, and found it very lan|guid. She told me &s;he was very full of Pain, and &s;eem'd as if &s;he had been beat with Cudgels. That, I &s;aid, was nothing but what was u&s;ual after all &s;uch violent Di&s;orders, and that &s;he would recover her Sore|ne&s;s in a few Days. I order'd her &s;ome Pills with <HI>A&s;a foetida,</HI> and a <HI>Galbanum</HI> Plai&s;ter, as al&s;o an Hy&s;terical Julep to drink after her Pills, or at any other Time when the Fits threaten'd. I order'd her likewi&s;e a volatile and cephalick Mixture, whereby the Lady is now altogether recover'd, excepting only that the Flu&s;hings &s;ometimes return upon her.</P>
<P>Another Di&s;order of the &s;ame Kind happen'd al|&s;o at this Time to one <HI>Mary Duroy,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Thomas Duroy</HI> Mercer in the <HI>Strand.</HI> I found her ve|ry much in the Vapours, and &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible; &s;he told me little of her Indi&s;po&s;ition, but &s;aid &s;he was the unhappie&s;t Woman in the World. That &s;he had
<PB N="5" REF="8">a Husband, who kept all his Affairs to him&s;elf, and never would acquaint her with any Thing he did, but went on his own Way to ruin him&s;elf and his whole Family. But as I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s with the Concerns between Man and Wife, I turn'd to an elderly Woman who attended her as her Nur&s;e, to learn what Condition her Mi&s;tre&s;s had been in. But the Nur&s;e had, it &s;eems, entred into Confederacy with her Mi&s;tre&s;s again&s;t Mr. <HI>Duroy;</HI> and to plea&s;e her, had been exa&s;perating his Faults, and, at the &s;ame Time, heightning her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Di&s;orders. For in&s;tead of an&s;wering my Que&s;tion, &s;he took up the Story where the other had ended. We Women, &s;ays &s;he, are now-a-days no more looked upon by the Men, than if we were Hobby-Hor&s;es. Look ye, Sir, my Ma&s;ter went a &s;tock-jobbing, and us'd to get his hundred Pounds a Day; my Mi&s;tre&s;s, like a good Wife, kept in the Shop all the while, from Morn to Night, and charg'd him every Day to bring her home a Gold Watch, which was but a &s;mall Thing to his gettings. He told her one Week after another he would be worth 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year the next, and then &s;he &s;hould have one of three&s;core Pounds; and till then, it was not becoming her to wear one; but God knows how he has jobb'd it at la&s;t, I am &s;ure he has left my Mi&s;tre&s;s in a &s;trange Condition, and never comes near her but on Sundays, and then he &s;its moping all Day without &s;peaking to any Body; and if my Mi&s;tre&s;s asks him a Que&s;tion, he tells her &s;he's a Fool, and Women will always be meddling with what does not concern them. Here I put a Stop to the Nur&s;e, who I found was but beginning her Nar|ration, in order to know &s;omething of her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Di&s;orders; bur they were both &s;o full of their Indig|nation again&s;t Mr. <HI>Duroy,</HI> that I could learn but lit|tle from them.</P>
<P>The Hopes and Expectations of mo&s;t Women are too violent to be baulk'd, and when they meet with
<PB N="6" REF="9">Di&s;appointments, their &s;oft delicate Natures are the lea&s;t able to bear them; they never fail to occa&s;ion great Di&s;orders, both in Body and Mind, let the Object be never &s;o trifling. The chief Cau&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Duroy</HI>'s Sickne&s;s, by what I could gather, proceeded from the Want of the Gold Watch, a thing &s;he had &s;et her Heart very much upon, and perhaps had con|ceived <HI>Ideas</HI> of in&s;ulting &s;ome of her Neighbours, who had got the &s;tart of her in other Re&s;pects. I found her Ca&s;e to be much the &s;ame with that of Lady <HI>Arabella,</HI> and therefore put her under the &s;ame Method of Cure. The Accident which happened to that Lady, put me al&s;o upon a Stratagem which I managed, &s;o as to be of Benefit to her, notwith&s;tand|ing it had like to have co&s;t the other her Life. No|thing contributes &s;o much to wear off a &s;ettled Ima|gination, as the giving Birth to &s;ome new Pa&s;&s;ion. I told her there was a very dangerous Sickne&s;s in Town, and tho' &s;he was altogether free from any Symptoms of it, yet it behov'd her not to give Way to fretting, otherwi&s;e I could not promi&s;e what might follow. Upon this both &s;he and her Nur&s;e were qui|eted, Mrs. <HI>Duroy</HI>'s Sorrow and Di&s;content was changed into a moderate Fear, which &s;oon wore off, and now &s;he is &s;o well, as to attend her Husband's Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>This Week I was call'd to &s;everal other Women in the &s;ame Condition, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Wife of a Sales|man in <HI>Long-lane,</HI> who had rail'd at her Husband for &s;elling old Rags, when others were getting E&s;tates in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and &s;etting up their Coaches. The Wife of <HI>John Tape,</HI> Haberda&s;her of Small-Wares, who, by the Lo&s;&s;es her Husband had &s;u&s;tain'd in the Bubbles, was di&s;appointed of a Diamond-Ring, a new white Damask Gown and Petticoat, and a large Silver Cup, which &s;he intended again&s;t her next Lying|in. But there is one Circum&s;tance which ought not to be omitted, becau&s;e it contributed very much to
<PB N="7" REF="10">the Aggravation of her Di&s;temper, and that was her Husband's ill U&s;age. It &s;eems &s;he had been the Cau&s;e of his going into the Bubbles; and from the Time they &s;unk, he never ceas'd upbraiding her with her imagi|nary Finery, until he made the poor Woman not on|ly mi&s;carry, but in that Weakne&s;s almo&s;t di&s;tracted. <HI>Martha Firkin,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Jonathan Firkin,</HI> Chee&s;e|monger, and <HI>Mary Pickle,</HI> the Wife of <HI>James Pickle,</HI> Salter, were al&s;o in a mi&s;erable Condition. I found both the&s;e good Women had per&s;uaded their Husbands very earne&s;tly not to meddle with the Stocks. But the one had promis'd his Wife a new Damask-Bed for the be&s;t Chamber, and an ea&s;y Chair of the &s;ame, with a Carpet for the Dining-Room; and the other had bought his Wife a Set of new China, with half a dozen new-fa&s;hion'd Spoons, a Silver Tea-Pot, and a Soop-Ladle; but the Misfortunes tho&s;e Men had drawn upon them&s;elves, had been the Cau&s;e of their Wives Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e have &s;ucceeded very well under my Care; but there was a Number of others who are like to continue in a mi&s;erable Condition, who&s;e Names I have omitted out of Tenderne&s;s, becau&s;e I found them &s;ubject to an Infirmity which is not alto|ther becoming their Sex; and that is, an un&s;ea&s;ona|ble and immoderate U&s;e of &s;pirituous Liquors. No|thing is &s;o de&s;tructive to hy&s;terical Women as Drams; and yet, from a kind of craving Nece&s;&s;ity, they are apt to have Recour&s;e to them in their Languors and &s;inking Fits, which confirm them &s;o into a Habit, that they return upon every Surprize, or upon the lea&s;t &s;light Di&s;order.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 7. I was call'd to <HI>T'. M.</HI> Gent. aged 39. of a thin &s;pare talli&s;h Body, and of a pale Complexion. When I fir&s;t enter'd the Room, I was &s;omewhat &s;ur|priz'd; his Head was as large as a Porridge-pot; for he had got five or &s;ix Woollen Caps upon it, over all which was another lin'd with Fur; upon his Body
<PB N="8" REF="11">were &s;everal Flannel Wa&s;tcoats, a Ca&s;&s;ock of thick Cloth, with a thick wadded Gown, and about his Shoulders the Quilt which he had taken from off the Bed. A Gentleman, who was &s;itting by him, &s;eeing me look upon him with &s;ome Earne&s;tne&s;s, bur&s;t out into a Fit of Laughter, which gave great Offence to my Patient, who, till then, was &s;carce able to &s;peak. This un&s;ea&s;onable Mirth in his Friend put him into &s;uch a Di&s;order, that I &s;oon perceiv'd what his In|di&s;po&s;ition was, and likewi&s;e that he had been &s;ome time a <HI>Valetudinarian.</HI> I advis'd him not to give way to Pa&s;&s;ion, telling him it would wa&s;te his Spirits, and then I took an Opportunity to ask him how long he had been ill. He was &s;o much out of Breath, that it was &s;ome time before he could make me any An&s;wer, but, as &s;oon as he was able, he told me he had been bad about a fortnight; whereupon his Friend ventu|red to put in another Word, and &s;aid, to his Know|ledge, he had not been in perfect Health the&s;e &s;even Years. This exa&s;perated my Patient to &s;uch a De|gree, that he gave the other the Lie. Was not I, &s;ays he, as well as you, or any Man alive, for three or four Months together? did I not go every Day to <HI>Change,</HI> eat roa&s;t Beef, and drink Claret? nay we eat &s;alt Beef, or roa&s;ted Pork, or any other Thing we could get. Now, Sir, I'll be judg'd by you, whether any Man that is not in perfect Health, could dige&s;t tho&s;e Things. I made An&s;wer, not very well. But as all this was little to the Purpo&s;e, I de&s;ired to know where the greate&s;t of his Trouble lay at pre&s;ent; but the Gentleman had not yet put an End to his Di&s;cour&s;e. Could any Man that has the lea&s;t Indi&s;po&s;ition, con|tinued he, eat Beans and Bacon, Green Pea&s;e, Colli|flowers, and Cabbages; any &s;uch Tra&s;h would at this time kill me in le&s;s than twelve Hours. I told him tho&s;e Things were generally accounted windy, and for that Rea&s;on, prejudicial to Per&s;ons in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances I judg'd him to be in. Whereupon I
<PB N="9" REF="12">ask'd him if he was not &s;ometimes troubled with Cholick Pains. Oh! always Sir, &s;ays he, never without them. Then I ask'd if he had not a Pain, or rather a Weight and Unea&s;ine&s;s on his left Side. At that Que&s;tion his Colour chang'd, his Hands trem|bled, and I perceived at the &s;ame Time a univer&s;al Di&s;order; But recovering a little, he went into the Clo&s;et, and brought out three or four Pots and Ba|&s;ons, one after another, in which he had made Water at &s;everal Times. I perceive, &s;ays he, you have the &s;ame Notion of my Di&s;temper, that &s;everal others of your Profe&s;&s;ion have had; you fancy I have got the Spleen, and that all my Ailments are imaginary; but I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, you'll find your &s;elf mi&s;taken. Don't you &s;ee there, how clear my Water is? there is not the lea&s;t Sign of Concoction in it; I am told it prog|no&s;ticates a <HI>Delirium,</HI> and I expect every Minute when I &s;hall be out of my Sen&s;es. Feel my Pul&s;e, what a burning Fever I have upon me. Upon this I took hold of his Arm, and told him it was fitter for him to be in Bed than up; for it was then very late. But, &s;ays he, I cannot lie in Bed as tho&s;e do, that love to indulge them&s;elves; and for that Rea&s;on, mo&s;t People think nothing ails me, but that I only fancy my &s;elf to be bad. I made An&s;wer, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons were much mi&s;taken, that he was indeed very ill, tho' to the be&s;t of my Judgment, I could not &s;ay he was in Danger. I told him that I would vi&s;it him early next Morning; but as yet, it was not proper to pre&s;cribe any Thing for him, excepting only white Wine and Water, which I order'd him to drink.</P>
<P>This Gentleman has been a Valetudinarian from his Youth, which proceeded from a natural Indo|lence, that ought to have been broke and overcome by Bu&s;ine&s;s; but as he had a &s;ufficient Patrimony, he gave him&s;elf wholly up to Idlene&s;s, and would &s;eldom go abroad, either upon his nece&s;&s;ary Affairs, or for his Diver&s;ion; yet the natural Love and Indul|gence
<PB N="10" REF="13">to his own Per&s;on, made him feed plentifully, tho' he had no Exerci&s;e or Imployment to dige&s;t it. This had laid the Foundation of his Di&s;temper; by which Means, he became al&s;o unfit for any of the Offices of Life; for as he had, in a manner, &s;eque&s;ter'd him&s;elf from the Society of Mankind, &s;o nothing was more burden&s;om to him than Company; neither was this to be wondered at, for he was grown the Je&s;t and Diver&s;ion of all his Acquaintance. And as the Mind &s;oon takes Part in all &s;uch Indi&s;po&s;itions, this &s;olitary Per&s;on's Imaginations became exceedingly vi|tiated, and his whole Thoughts were center'd upon his own Condition, which he now believes to be the mo&s;t unhappy of any Man alive. The nobler Pa&s;|&s;ions are quite extingui&s;hed and &s;unk, in the Exce&s;&s;es of Fear, Sorrow, and Angui&s;h of Heart, which pre|&s;ent &s;uch dreadful Images before him, as ca&s;t a Gloom upon the whole Face of Nature, that no|thing can reli&s;h with him: And albeit this Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind makes him &s;hun Company, yet the Appre|hen&s;ion of Death, or &s;ome &s;udden Di&s;a&s;ter, works &s;o powerfully upon him, that he can never be alone, but mu&s;t always have &s;ome near Relation or old Ac|quaintance with him, who is not a Stranger to his Condition, tho' even that Per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding all his good Offices, mu&s;t be a Slave to his Humours. His way of thinking is become different from that of all other Men, yet he judges him&s;elf &s;o ab&s;olutely right in all his Apprehen&s;ions, that if his Friend contradicts him in any Thing, he believes it either in Deri&s;ion of him, or out of Ignorance.</P>
<P>Thus much I learned of his Friend, who was al&s;o his near Relation, and had indeed judg'd accurately enough of his Cou&s;in's Condition, which &s;eems to be the more evident, from the extraordinary Alteration that happened to him, while he frequented the Alley, and was engaged in Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Di&s;appointments he met with there, were the Occa&s;ion of his &s;udden
<PB N="11" REF="14">Relap&s;e; but a Man in his Circum&s;tances could never be happy, had ev'ry Thing he propos'd to him&s;elf an&s;wered to his Wi&s;hes; for as all his Labour tend|ed only to a further Gratification of his indolent Hu|mor, he mu&s;t by degrees have fal'n back into his ac|cu&s;tomed Di&s;orders, only that a more plentiful For|tune might, in Time, have increas'd his Maladies, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening them. Neither is this altogether improbable, from what his Friend further told me, concerning &s;ome Re&s;olutions he had taken. He bought a piece of Ground, on which if his Affairs had &s;ucceeded, he de&s;ign'd to have built a Hou&s;e, or rather a Ca&s;tle, for the Walls were to have been four Foot thick, and under the Lining, they were to be laid over with Pitch and Bitumen, the Windows were all to be double glaz'd, and the inner Doors to draw up and down like Sa&s;hes. He &s;aid this was the ancient Way of Building, and Men liv'd then to a much greater Age, and more healthful than now, that the unwhol&s;ome Damps come through our thin Walls.</P>
<P>After hearing tho&s;e things, I very rea&s;onably de|&s;pair'd of doing Service to a Man who had given him|&s;elf up wholly to his own deluded Imaginations. But according to my Promi&s;e, I waited on him next Morning, where his Friend was &s;o kind as to meet me. It was broad Day when I came to the Hou&s;e, but the Windows were all &s;hut as at Midnight, with a Candle burning on the Table. I ask'd if he was not almo&s;t &s;tifled for want of Air: But this prov'd to be an un&s;ea&s;onable Que&s;tion, for he was out of Humor with his Friend, who ju&s;t before had been telling him how dangerous it would be to burn Candles Night and Day in his new Hou&s;e, where there was to be &s;o much combu&s;tible Matter. This had put him into a very great Pa&s;&s;ion; but as &s;oon as I came to know the Cau&s;e of it, I &s;tudy'd to pacify him, telling him his Friend did that only out of good Hu|mor,
<PB N="12" REF="15">to divert him in his Sickne&s;s, and that he ought to take it in good part. After this, I ask'd him how he had re&s;ted all Night; he told me very badly, but that the Apothecary had mi&s;taken his Di&s;tem|per, and that it was very &s;trange no Body could find out what the Matter was with him; whereupon he went again into his Clo&s;et, and brought the Water which he had made in the Night. See you, Sir, &s;ays he, with abundance of Terror in his Looks, whether I be a Man for this World or not; Sir, you are a Phy&s;ician, I know you are not afraid to dip your Fin|ger into it, and ta&s;te it, you will find it as &s;weet as any Well-Water. I was &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd at this odd Notion, and how it had come into his Head, for there was nothing in the Water but what was common to Hypochondriacal Per&s;ons, who, when their Di&s;orders are much upon 'em, make large quan|tities of Water, which is al&s;o very clear. But a Gentleman had &s;ent his Servant that Morning, to en|quire how he did, who came in about the Time he was taking a Survey of his Ba&s;ons, and &s;eeing a great Quantity of clear Water, took it to be the &s;ame Di&s;|temper, the la&s;t Ma&s;ter he had &s;erv'd, dy'd of, which he told him was a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> and that the Doctors us'd to ta&s;te it every Time they came to &s;ee him, and always &s;aid he would die, becau&s;e there was no Salt in it. I us'd all the Arguments I could, to beat this Whim out of his Head, but to no purpo&s;e, it being but new; I ordered what was proper for him, and left him for two or three Days; but I found he could not be per&s;waded to make U&s;e of my Pre&s;crip|tions, but was now about to call another Phy&s;ician, only that the Apothecary prevented him, by &s;ending him &s;ome Things he &s;aid were proper in a <HI>Diabetes.</HI></P>
<P>When I came again to vi&s;it him, I found him un|der a fre&s;h Di&s;order, for what he had taken had in|deed put a Stop to the Di&s;charges by Urine, but not the right Way; for he was now troubled with a vio|lent
<PB N="13" REF="16">Defluxion, and he &s;pit like one in a Salivation. Now, &s;ays he, I hope there needs be no further Doubt concerning my Di&s;temper. You &s;ee, Sir, how fa&s;t I am going; he had kept two or three Pieces of hard di&s;colour'd Flegm in a Gallipot, which he took to be &s;ome of his Lungs: But when we came to examine them, they were di&s;&s;olv'd: Whereupon I told him, there was nothing here but Flegm; and that I hoped his Lungs were not &s;o bad as he imagin'd. But all this would not &s;atisfy him; for he fancied the Cat, or &s;ome Dog, had been in the Room, and had taken 'em out. I order'd that Night a Draught, and bid him be of good Cheer, telling him, that he was not in &s;o imminent Danger as he apprehended. At this he was a little reviv'd, and ask'd me, if any Man could live after part of his Lungs were come up? O! yes, &s;ays I, never fear. I had order'd the Draught to be re|peated the Night following; &s;o that I did not &s;ee him for two Days more.</P>
<P>When I came the fourth Time, all things were much chang'd, and tho&s;e Symptoms gone off. He was al&s;o very much metamorphos'd in his Apparel; for, in&s;tead of the Bed-Quilt, which he us'd to wear about his Shoulders, he was now cover'd with a Bear's Skin. His Friend was along with him, and &s;eeing me look earne&s;tly upon him, as I did at fir&s;t, he could not again refrain from Laughter; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, Had my Cou&s;in, &s;ays he, been cloath'd in a Lion's Skin, as he is now in that of a Bear, you would undoubtedly have taken him for a &s;econd <HI>Hercules.</HI> But this was the Cau&s;e of fre&s;h Heat in my Patient, who told his Friend, with a great deal of Pa&s;&s;ion, that tho' he was forc'd to wear a Bear's Skin out of Nece&s;|&s;ity, yet it would become him much better, &s;ince he was as &s;avage as the Creature to which it belong'd. But I interrupted the Di&s;pute, and then ask'd the Gen|tleman, how he did? He told me, he was &s;omething better, and that he had got this Skin to wear about
<PB N="14" REF="17">him, becau&s;e he found the Quilt too heavy. When I was about to take my Leave of him, he told me with &s;ome Compliment, that I needed not give my&s;elf the Trouble to make him any more regular Vi&s;its; for he hop'd he was in a fair way to do well. Whereup|on I parted, with a Congratulation for the promi&s;ing Signs of his Recovery.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was gone, the Gentleman's Friend fol|low'd me to a Coffee-Hou&s;e I u&s;ually frequent, and gave me an Account of a new Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had pleas'd his Cou&s;in wonderfully; but that he was a&s;ham'd to mention it to me, becau&s;e he had been &s;o often mi&s;|taken. It &s;eems, while the Spitting continu'd, the Thoughts of his Lungs coming up had frightened him to &s;uch a Degree, that notwith&s;tanding he was grown a great deal better by the Things I had or|der'd him, yet he &s;ent for a Scrivener to make his Will. When the Scrivener came, they were under &s;ome Difficulty how to di&s;po&s;e of his Sub&s;tance among his Friends; it being impo&s;&s;ible to know what he was worth; for all he had was in the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> but he fell upon a Contrivance of his own, and told the Scrivener, he would have it made into &s;o many Di|vidends (for the&s;e are Words he had been much us'd to of late) he would give a third Part to one, a fourth to another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Scrivener, who was not accu&s;tom'd to any thing out of the common Form, told him, all his Goods and Chattels, and every par|ticular Sum, ought to be &s;pecify'd, otherwi&s;e it wou'd only occa&s;ion Law-Suits among his Relations, after he was dead. At that Word he &s;tarted, and began to look pale; for he could never hear of Death without very great Di&s;orders. A Neighbour, who was call'd up to atte&s;t the Will, and who, 'till now, could &s;carce|ly believe him to be in good earne&s;t, ask'd him, what his Sickne&s;s was? He made An&s;wer, that he fir&s;t had a <HI>Fever,</HI> and then a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> and was now fallen into a deep <HI>Con&s;umption;</HI> and that he was, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="15" REF="18">all tho&s;e Afflictions, tormented with an in&s;upportable Pain in his Bowels. Upon this, his Neighbour told him, he knew a Man who was ju&s;t in the &s;ame Con|dition for a great while together, and had been in the Hands of a great many Doctors, but none of them could do him any Good, 'till at la&s;t he met with one who made him wear a Tyger's Skin, with the hairy &s;ide outmo&s;t, and in a few Days he voi|ded a Worm Thirty &s;ix Yards and an Inch long, and has been as well &s;ince as any Man alive. This Story work'd &s;o powerfully upon his Imagination, that he &s;oon believ'd he had got &s;uch a Worm within him, and every Time his Guts growl'd, he fancy'd he felt it move. He &s;ent all over the Town for a Tyger's Skin, but at that Time there was none to be had; but a Furrier, who came to know what it was for, and interpreting all this to be nothing but a Piece of Lunacy, and that the Worm was rather in his Head than his Belly, per&s;waded him that a Bear's Skin would do as well, and that he had &s;old &s;everal for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This his Friend told me was the true Rea&s;on of his wearing the Bears Skin, and why he was now become &s;o &s;hy and indifferent about my further vi&s;it|ing him, having from thence conceiv'd unque&s;tiona|ble Hopes of his doing well. And moreover, that he was in &s;o con&s;tant an Expectation of his Delive|rance, that he had provided a new Clo&s;e-&s;tool, with a Pan big enough to receive the Worm; and that all the Family was call'd together as often as he went to it, that they might be Witne&s;&s;es thereof.</P>
<P>In this Condition I left him; but I have been &s;ince inform'd, that the Cure has not &s;ucceeded to his Li|king, tho' he is &s;till &s;o much taken with the Fancy, that he has now apply'd him&s;elf to Mr. <HI>John Moor</HI> Apothecary in <HI>Abchurch-lane,</HI> in order to have &s;ome Do&s;es of his Worm Powder.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Penelope</HI></P>
<PB N="16" REF="19">
<P>Mrs. <HI>Penelope Whitewa&s;h,</HI> a Maiden Lady, aged 38, was mi&s;erably afflicted with the Vapours. Another Phy&s;ician had been employ'd before I was call'd to her; but &s;he told me he had pre&s;crib'd nothing but a Bottle of Drops to drink with her Tea, and that &s;he believ'd he did not imagine how bad &s;he was, for he came but &s;eldom, and then made very light of her Indi&s;po&s;ition. Upon this I de&s;ired to know where mo&s;t of her Trouble lay. Indeed, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, there are many Things trouble me, but that which lies heavie&s;t upon me at pre&s;ent, is a continual Faintne&s;s; and the Apothecary tells me I have got a Fever up|on my Spirits. I went to draw my Chair near e|nough to take hold of her Wri&s;t, in order to feel her Pul&s;e. But this had like to have caus'd a very great Di&s;turbance, for the Chair pinch'd the Foot of a little Dog, who had been &s;ome time &s;crambling about my Legs, but was now lain down under it to re&s;t him. This put the Lady into a great Fright, and made her call out &s;o loud, that her Spirits indeed &s;uffered very much by it; but when &s;he found the Dog was not hurt, &s;he &s;oon recovered, and told him he was very naughty to be always in Peoples Way, and bid him not go near the Gentleman's Chair any more: Then &s;he addre&s;s'd her &s;elf to me, and told me, the only thing that made her have a Concern for that Dog was, becau&s;e he came of a Bitch which had been her Mother's; with that &s;he fetch'd a deep Sigh, and began to be &s;omewhat di&s;order'd, and ask'd a Gentle|woman, who was by, for her Bottle, that &s;he might &s;mell to it. I bid the Lady be of good Courage, tel|ling her, that I hop'd there was no Danger; and that I would order &s;ome Things would &s;oon relieve her; and accordingly I pre&s;crib'd her &s;ome Pills, with a Ce|phalick Mixture, and then left her. When I was got down Stairs into the Entry, an elderly Gentlewo|man met me, (who I under&s;tood to be the Landla|dy) and ask'd what I thought of Madam. I told
<PB N="17" REF="20">her, &s;he would, in all probability, do well again. Indeed, Sir, &s;ays the Gentlewoman, &s;he frighten'd us all la&s;t Night; for &s;he happen'd to &s;ee a Shrowd on the Candle, and I cannot tell what may be in it, but &s;he believes ever &s;ince, that &s;he is a dying; for &s;he &s;ays, her Mother &s;aw ju&s;t &s;uch another but a little before her Death. I told her, there was nothing in that. It may be &s;o, reply'd the old Gentlewoman, and I believe it is only a Cold &s;he has got lately, when they were ma|king all this &s;tir about the <HI>Stock-Jobbers;</HI> for then &s;he us'd to dre&s;s every Day, and go into the City; and I perceive &s;he has never been to call well &s;ince. Ve|ry probable, &s;aid I, and with that I went out of Doors.</P>
<P>Next Morning, I made the Lady another Vi&s;it. When I fir&s;t enter'd the Room, the Lady told me, &s;he was a&s;ham'd; for &s;he was &s;o bad that &s;he could not put on clean Things, but was forc'd to be in that dirty pickle. Pray, Madam, &s;aid I, make no Apo|logy; for we never expect to find &s;ick Per&s;ons dre&s;s'd. She had got the Landlady's Daughter to keep her com|pany, and an ordinary Woman, with a Pot of Coffee before 'em; which gave me an Opportunity to ob|&s;erve, that Coffee was generally look'd upon to be bad for Per&s;ons in her Circum&s;tances. But the Lady made An&s;wer, that &s;he had not been drinking any of it her&s;elf, but had only provided it for Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> and that good Woman, who was &s;o kind as to come now and then to divert her. I told her, nothing would do her more Service than chearful Company. Upon this, &s;he ask'd me, if I lik'd Coffee? And whether I would be pleas'd to accept of a Di&s;h? I very &s;eldom com|ply with my Patients in things of this kind; but be|ing a cold raw Day, I drank one Di&s;h, which the La|dy pour'd out for me; and as &s;oon as I had empty'd my Cup, and that they found I was unwilling to have it fill'd again, I ob&s;erv'd the Landlady's Daughter take it up, and turn it round four or five &s;everal times,
<PB N="18" REF="21">looking earne&s;tly into it all the while: But the good Woman frown'd, and knit her Brows at her, and wink'd to my Patient, while the other was &s;o intent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> her Ob&s;ervations, that &s;he took no Notice, 'till at la&s;t &s;he was pull'd by her Petticoat; whereupon &s;he &s;et down the Cup, and I perceiv'd &s;he was at &s;ome Pains to &s;mother a Laugh. By this time I had &s;atis|fy'd the Lady in all the Que&s;tions &s;he had put to me concerning her Indi&s;po&s;ition; and it being full time for me to be gone, I left her. When I was got to the other &s;ide of the Door, the young Woman fell a laugh|ing aloud, and I over-heard her call to the Lady and the other Woman, to come and &s;ee what a large Pair of Horns there was in the Doctor's Cup. But as I am never offended at young's People's Mirth, I took no Notice, but went down Stairs into the Entry, where the Landlady was again come to meet me. She ask'd how I lik'd Madam to day? I told her, &s;he &s;eem'd to be a little more chearful; but that I was afraid &s;he did her&s;elf Harm by drinking too much Coffee, tho' &s;he was not willing to own it. But the Landlady con|firm'd what the Lady had &s;aid, and told me, that Ma|dam &s;eldom drinks any her&s;elf; but this Morning, &s;he had a Pot made for that Woman, whom &s;he gave me to under&s;tand was a Fortune-Teller, and one who knew every thing by looking into the Coffee-Grounds. That, I &s;aid, was indeed a way of Divining I had never heard of before. Then I ask'd what &s;he had told the Lady? Nay, an&s;wer'd the old Woman, I cannot &s;ay to you what may be in it; but &s;he tells Madam, &s;he always &s;ees a Coach and Six in her Cup; and that &s;he is &s;ure the <HI>South-Sea</HI> will ri&s;e to 1500 by <HI>Candlemas</HI> next; and in a little time after, &s;he will be married to a warm elderly Gentleman; and we believe it mu&s;t be her Cou|&s;in, who comes very often in the Afternoon to play at Cards with her; for he is ju&s;t &s;uch a Gentleman as &s;he de&s;cribes. She tells my Girl too, that &s;he is to be married to a fine proper young Man in a little
<PB N="19" REF="22">time, who will make her a very good Husband; that &s;he will have &s;everal fine Children, and want for nothing that any Woman can de&s;ire; and abun|dance of &s;uch Things, which, you know, plea&s;es young People. Very true, &s;aid I, and &s;o bid her a|dieu.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t Vi&s;it I made Mrs. <HI>White-wa&s;h;</HI> for I found &s;he had received no &s;mall Benefit from the Fortune-teller's favourable Delu&s;ions, which, altho' they were practi&s;ed with the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and &s;illy Device in the World, yet all were &s;o artfully &s;uited to the Lady's mo&s;t earne&s;t De&s;ires and Inclinations, that they ea&s;ily gain'd upon her Credulity, and will &s;erve for a Sea&s;on, to keep off that threatning Storm, which, in all probability, mu&s;t fall &s;o much the more heavy upon her, by how much her Expectations have been rais'd and exalted.</P>
<P>The following Week, which in my Account be|gan the 15th of <HI>October,</HI> prov'd a Time of &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s, that I never remember the like &s;ince I was able to practi&s;e; I had little or no Re&s;t, but was &s;ent for to all Quarters of the Town, and to many Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Rank; and every Time I came Home, I found my Hou&s;e throng'd with Peo|ple of inferior Degree, &s;ome of whom had been deep|ly engag'd in the Bubbles, but mo&s;t were Trade&s;men, who had &s;u&s;tain'd great Lo&s;&s;es, by furni&s;hing tho&s;e with Equipages, who had not as yet been in any Decorum &s;uitable to their new Acqui&s;itions: A few of the latter were indeed &s;o happy as to be engag'd in full Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had their Heads turn'd upon Me|thods to retrieve their Lo&s;&s;es, which had diverted their Minds, and kept off melancholy Thoughts; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t only came upon the Account of their Wives and Daughters, who had Time to think, and had there|fore laid tho&s;e Things more to Heart. The Hurry I was now brought into, confounded me to &s;uch a Degree, and the va&s;t many mi&s;erable Objects I had
<PB N="20" REF="23">&s;een, dwelt &s;o on my own Imagination, that I began to think the Di&s;temper infectious; and for that Rea&s;on, I kept at Home one whole Day, and would not &s;o much as &s;uffer my Doors to be opened. But I was &s;o much terrify'd at la&s;t, that I fell a trembling every time I heard any Body knock; and methought every Voice I heard in the Street nam'd Sir <HI>John Midriff.</HI> And ju&s;t as I imagin'd, many of the Symptoms &s;oon took hold of me, and no one can conceive the great Di&s;orders I labour'd under for the Space of fourteen Hours. I began al&s;o to think of the Coffee-Cup, and was angry, and &s;napt at my Wife every Time &s;he &s;poke to me. But after I had &s;lept upon it, I &s;um|mon'd all my Rea&s;on, and found my Body was per|fectly well, and that my Di&s;turbances were only ima|ginary; I put on a Re&s;olution not to give way to any &s;uch Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially at a time when &s;o ma|ny Objects call'd for my A&s;&s;i&s;tance; I therefore dre&s;s'd my &s;elf, and went abroad, as u&s;ual, to vi&s;it my Pa|tients.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I made this Week was to an old U&s;urer, who had been no Proprietor in the Stocks; but had privately lent very near 12000 <HI>l.</HI> at 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> In|tere&s;t, and had him&s;elf paid at the Rate of 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for a good Part of that Money, which he was afraid would all be &s;unk, becau&s;e both Debtors and Bond&s;men were &s;hipwreck'd, if not quite lo&s;t in the <HI>South Sea.</HI> But this Gentleman was really altogether incurable, for he had liv'd very ab&s;temiou&s;ly for a|bove 20 Years; but, &s;ince his Lo&s;&s;es, could not be pre|vail'd on to take any Su&s;tenance, excepting Bread and Water, for he was of Opinion he ought to fa&s;t for his Folly. After I had made him two or three Vi&s;its, and had acquainted him with the Hurry I was in, and that I was afraid I could not attend upon him any more, and when he found that I was ju&s;t a going, he &s;top'd me, and putting on his Spectacles, he went to a Drawer, where I heard him chink over a
<PB N="21" REF="24">great many Pieces, and after I had waited his Time, which was a pretty good while, he brought me a Quarter-guinea, and pre&s;s'd it into the Hollow of my Hand, bidding me carry it home to my Wife for a Pur&s;e-penny; and at the &s;ame time ob&s;erv'd, that Gold was now-a-days become as rare as a Sallad at Chri&s;tmas. From him I went to a middle ag'd Wi|dow Lady, who was mi&s;erably in the Vapours, for &s;he had &s;old the Life-Rent of her Jointure for a &s;mall Sum of Money, which &s;he put out to be improv'd, in order to marry a lu&s;ty young Man, an Attorney, who was her Steward, and did all her Bu&s;ine&s;s. From that Lady I went to a Frenchman, who is an Arti&s;t, and had work'd above 20 Years in a Garret, during which Time he had liv'd for the mo&s;t part on Roots and Herbs, and &s;ometimes a little foetid Oyl for Sauce, whereby he had hoarded up &s;ome Money, but had lo&s;t it all in the Bubbles. When I came to him, I ask'd what was the Matter with him. Oh&mdash;de Matter, Sir, &s;aid he, I have got your D&mdash;md Angli&s;e Maladie, that makes your Man and Woman hang dem&s;elves in de Room, and drown in de Water, and if I had been ane de An|glisman I had certainly done my &s;elf &s;o too, for I have lo&s;t all my Money and my Health. I could not but pity the poor Frenchman very much, for I under&s;tood he had been mi&s;erably bit by Men who&s;e Birth and Station &s;hould have put them above &s;uch Practices, and therefore I advis'd him to apply to his Bu&s;ine&s;s again, and I vi&s;ited him until he was pretty well, without taking any Fee of him.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Hazard</HI> E&s;q; was al&s;o one of tho&s;e who u&s;her'd in this Week's Practice. He is a noted Game&s;ter, and has play'd away above two Thirds of a very hand&s;ome E&s;tate, which was the Acqui&s;ition of an old griping Uncle. The Remainder he di&s;pos'd of in the publick. This Gentleman, tho' he had gone through many Changes and Vici&s;&s;itudes, yet he was never &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd as with his late Di&s;appoint|ments;
<PB N="22" REF="25">becau&s;e he imagin'd him&s;elf arriv'd at that which he had been labouring for, early and late, ever &s;ince he was come to Man's E&s;tate. I under&s;tood he had &s;everal grand Projects in view; but among others, had a particular Eye not only to &s;ome certain Men of Quality's E&s;tates, but al&s;o to their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, which he thought was only but throwing a lucky Main or two as &s;oon as he was able to enter the Li&s;ts with them. But although his Di&s;temper was exceeding violent, and was al&s;o much heightned by Pa&s;&s;ion; yet it did not la&s;t long; for the next time I came to wait upon him, I found all things much alter'd; for he was whi&s;tling and &s;inging, and practi&s;ing by him|&s;elf, and with a couragious Air rattling and &s;triking the Dice-Box with great force upon the Table; and as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he call'd out, What do you think of your Patient now, Sir <HI>John?</HI> I have rea|&s;on'd my&s;elf well by Philo&s;ophy; for I believe a Man of no E&s;tate has as much Plea&s;ure in winning two or three Yellow-Boys, as a rich Man when he ca&s;ts up a Thou&s;and Pounds; and I am of opinion, a Man may have as much Satisfaction in a neat clean Wench in a Callico-Gown and Petticoat, as with a Lord's Mi&s;tre&s;s, who has perhaps no more to &s;et her off, than only that &s;he is a Nobleman's Choice; and for that Rea&s;on, is kept fine, like a Lady, and at a Di&s;|tance from the Vulgar. Upon this I could not but re|flect in my own Mind, what Numbers of Per&s;ons were &s;upported in their Folly by a vicious Application of Philo&s;ophical Maxims and Rules; but I made an&s;wer with a Smile, That I was not much acquainted with that Kind of Philo&s;ophy. This was an&s;wer'd with a loud Laugh from my Patient; and as &s;oon as he had recover'd him&s;elf, that we had Time to exchange Com|pliments, I took my Leave; for I found he was not &s;u&s;ceptible of very la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ions to hurt him, but was harden'd in the Ways of Iniquity, which were almo&s;t equal to him, whether in a higher or lower Capacity.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="26">
<P>The next remarkable Patient was a famous <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ting Teacher,</HI> who had acquir'd a con&s;iderable Fortune, which had enabled him to become a no &s;mall Adven|turer in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI> This had laid the Foundation of all his Illne&s;s; but there were other Circum&s;tances that contributed to keep up his Di&s;orders. When I had en|quir'd into his Condition, and found him to be touch'd with the Spleen, I thought it might be no hard mat|ter to do him &s;ervice, as he &s;eem'd to be a Man of &s;ome Sen&s;e and Learning; and therefore &s;poke my Sen|timents freely, telling him, he ought not to mind his Di&s;appointments, &s;o as to give way to di&s;orderly I|maginations. But he made An&s;wer, that the&s;e were at this time the lea&s;t of his Care; tho' he could not but own, they had made &s;ome deep Impre&s;&s;ions on him at fir&s;t; but that now he found his Body very much di&s;temper'd, and there mu&s;t be &s;ome uncom|mon Method taken for his Recovery, otherwi&s;e he would &s;oon become one of the unhappie&s;t Men alive. Tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are &s;o u&s;ual from Hypochondriack Per&s;ons, that I gave little ear to them, but per&s;i&s;ted in my former Advice; and after I had order'd him &s;ome Cephalicks, I left him.</P>
<P>After this, I vi&s;ited him &s;everal Days, but found him always harping on the &s;ame String, which made me &s;omewhat more inqui&s;itive than I had been before. He told me, he had &s;ometimes a grievous Pain in his Head, &s;ometimes in his Shoulders, and very often in his Shin Bones; and, indeed, Sir, &s;aid he, you will hardly imagine what a mi&s;erable Condition I am in. There was &s;till none of tho&s;e Symptoms but may at|tend Hypochondriack Per&s;ons; and therefore I us'd &s;everal fre&s;h Arguments to fortify him again&s;t his groundle&s;s Apprehen&s;ions; but when Men are once given up to the Delu&s;ions that attend this gloomy Di&s;temper, they become &s;o much en&s;lav'd and over|whelm'd with Fear, that every Idea pre&s;ents &s;ome|thing unto them that is dreadful; a great many new
<PB N="24" REF="27">Di&s;a&s;ters are daily form'd, which have no real Foot|ing but in their di&s;temper'd Imaginations; and many old Afflictions, which had long been vanqui&s;h'd, are aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n revi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">'d with &s;uch a Train of Aggravations, that they render Life no better than a tormenting Dream.</P>
<P>This was now become the Ca&s;e of our Par&s;on, who had indeed got the better of tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions which had at fir&s;t given Birth to his Di&s;orders; but it was by others that were much more dreadful. He would often begin to di&s;clo&s;e him&s;elf to me, but &s;omething always prevented him; his Colour often left him, his Hands &s;hook, and I ob&s;erv'd him to be under the grea|te&s;t Di&s;turbance imaginable. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee the Reverend Divine in all this Confu&s;ion; whereupon, I &s;poke to him with all po&s;|&s;ible Tenderne&s;s, intreating him not to be too re&s;erv'd, but to tell me freely what it was troubled him &s;o much. Sir, &s;aid he, you cannot probably have any Su&s;picion of what I am now going to acquaint you with; and if I was to give you all the Signs of my Di&s;temper, they might indeed puzzle you; but you would hardly gue&s;s at it, as it is a Malady very unbecoming one of my Calling, nor any ways agreeable to the Reputa|tion I have always had among Men. By the&s;e Expre&s;|&s;ions I began to think he had, perhaps, been lately in Liquor, and had fallen into the Hands of &s;ome lewd Woman. Whereupon, I conjur'd him not to hide any thing from me; but if he had receiv'd any Injury from that Sex, to confe&s;s freely. The Ice being now broke, he &s;hook his Head, and told me, it was a great deal wor&s;e than I could imagine; for the Di&s;temper had lain in his Blood above Twenty Years. I got it, &s;aid he, when I was a young raw Student, and I am afraid, by what I find now, I have never been rightly cur'd of it. I ask'd him, why he had been &s;o negligent not to have it cur'd all that while; and at the &s;ame time I ob&s;erv'd to him, that he did not look like one who had lain under that Di&s;temper. To this he &s;aid,
<PB N="25" REF="28">he had been as well as any Man till lately, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ow he was &s;ure the latent Poi&s;on had begun to work, and was got into his Bones, which mu&s;t no doubt be the Rea&s;on why he oftentimes felt &s;o great Pain in them. But when I was going to undeceive him in this Particular, he put a Stop to me, and &s;aid, if the Di&s;temper &s;hould break out upon him at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uncture, it was but a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment for his Ava|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ce; for before he put his Money into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e was under various Scruples, and had many &s;ecret Conflicts, whether he ought to de&s;ire more than he had already; or, if that was allowable, whether he ought to follow the Example of worldly Men in be|coming a Trader in the Publick, &s;ince he ob&s;erv'd it had been the Cau&s;e of &s;o much Athei&s;m among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd had drawn the Hearts of mo&s;t Per&s;ons from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he true Object of their Adoration into downright <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dolatry; and therefore as he was &s;en&s;ible of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rror in this Particular, and had even acted in &s;ome Mea&s;ure again&s;t the Dictates of his better Know|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">edge, he feared it was at la&s;t <HI>come home to him,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd that perhaps he was vi&s;ited with this dreadful Calamity, which otherwi&s;e might never have broke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut upon him. I made An&s;wer, that he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeed do better, than to make a religious Improve|ment of all his Afflictions; but yet, I &s;aid the lo&s;s of his Money &s;eem'd to be the real and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Puni&s;hment he underwent at pre&s;ent, for in what re|lated to his Per&s;on, I &s;aid I could not perceive any Thing ami&s;s with him. But all this did not give him any great Satisfaction, for he was al&s;o under no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mall Anxiety about his Wife, to think that &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer innocently on his Account. He told me &s;he had likewi&s;e been very much troubled with the Head-ach of late, and had broke out all about her Mouth, and that &s;he complain'd greatly of a &s;inking in her Spirits; but I found his Wife was only in the Vapours, as him&s;elf was in the Spleen, and there|fore
<PB N="26" REF="29">I gave him to under&s;tand, that tho&s;e Di&s;orders were no other than what are common to mo&s;t Wo|men when any Thing troubles them. Upon this he paus'd a while, for he was &s;en&s;ible &s;he had laid their late Di&s;appointments pretty much to Heart; but there was one Circum&s;tance that &s;till terrify'd him more than all the re&s;t, he had got two or three Pim|ples on his Fore-head, which he imagin'd certainly to be the Effects of the Di&s;temper; and I believe no grave Man before him ever con&s;ulted the Gla&s;s &s;o much as he had done while he was under this Di&s;tur|bance; for all the Time I was with him, he was con|tinually pulling back his Wig to examine tho&s;e Erup|tions, and as often as he put his Hands upon them, he remain'd &s;peechle&s;s for a Minute or two, and &s;ometimes he al&s;o felt his No&s;e, le&s;t any Thing &s;hould be ami&s;s there. But at length a&s;&s;uming a little more Courage, he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to me in this Manner: I doubt, Sir, &s;aid he, tho' you are de&s;er|vedly reputed a very great Phy&s;ician, you may, however, be unacquainted with my Ca&s;e; for if I be not mi&s;taken, I believe it is more in the Way of a Surgeon than in yours. I made An&s;wer, that vene|real Ca&s;es, if he meant tho&s;e, were no le&s;s the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Phy&s;ician, than any other, and that Recour&s;e was commonly had to &s;ome one of our Profe&s;&s;ion, when they prov'd too hard and difficult for the Sur|geons to manage. Pray then, Sir, &s;aid he, pointing to his Fore-head, what do you think can be the Meaning of the&s;e Blotches? don't you believe there mu&s;t be &s;omething more than <HI>ordinary</HI> in them? I told him they were nothing but what ev'ry one was &s;ubject to as well as he, upon catching Cold, or up|on any &s;light Di&s;order; and I ob&s;erv'd that the Di|&s;temper could not conceal it &s;elf &s;o long as he fancied, without making &s;ome Havock upon the Con&s;titution, and therefore beg'd him to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd, and not tor|ture him&s;elf with &s;uch Whims and Imaginations. But
<PB N="27" REF="30">to convince me they were no Whims, he took a Key out of his Pocket and opened a Drawer, where there were &s;ome Books with the Leaves folded in &s;everal Places, among which was <HI>Martin</HI>'s <HI>Treati&s;e of the ve|nereal Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> where he &s;hew'd me &s;everal In&s;tances of Per&s;ons who had that Di&s;temper lurking many Years in their Blood. But I told him it was a Lo&s;s to any one, and even to Men of Learning, to read Books of Phy&s;ick, unle&s;s they had made that their particular Study, for they might very readily fall upon bad Authors, and even on &s;candalous Books that had been writ upon &s;ome De&s;ign, and that many a one had been &s;o much terrify'd with the fal&s;e or injudicious In&s;tances in tho&s;e Books, that altho' they were al|together free from that Di&s;temper, yet they could never be ea&s;y till they came into the Hands of tho&s;e who would put them unnece&s;&s;arily under the Grand Cure, and therefore I bid him re&s;t &s;atisfy'd, unle&s;s he had been lately tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing. But at this he lifted up his Hands, and gave me to under&s;tand he had been married upwards of 20 Years, and a&s;&s;ur'd me upon his Honour, that he never had any Thing to do with any Woman be|&s;ides his Wife all that Time. But Sir, &s;ays he, my Wife is a very likely Woman, and what can be the Rea&s;on I could never have a Child by her? I &s;atisfy'd him that was no Rule, for there were many In&s;tances of that kind, where neither the Man nor Woman were di&s;|ea&s;ed, tho' there might be &s;ome natural Defect, which mo&s;t commonly lies in the Woman; and on the other Hand, that there were al&s;o many In&s;tances of vene|real Per&s;ons, who had begot Children even when the Infection had &s;pread it &s;elf in the Blood. And do you think, &s;aid he, that my Wife may be &s;afe, not|with&s;tanding all this, and that &s;he can be in no Dan|ger for the future? I made An&s;wer there was no Manner of Danger; for I could di&s;cover nothing in his Ca&s;e that could be the lea&s;t injurious to her. This put &s;o much new Life into the good Man, that he
<PB N="28" REF="31">was even like to leap out of his Skin, and in a Tran|&s;port of Joy told me I was his Friend, his Father Confe&s;&s;or, and the rare&s;t Man in the World, for deli|vering him out of all his Fears, by &s;uch &s;olid and convincing Arguments. After which he began to tell me of the melancholy and frightful Ideas he had lately fo&s;tered in his Brea&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> what his own Con|gregation, and all other &s;ober Di&s;&s;enters would have thought of him, what his Friends and Acquaintance among the Mini&s;ters, what a Wound it would have been to Religion, e&s;pecially &s;ince his Life and Con|ver&s;ation had hitherto been un&s;potted as to the World. Had People once got a Notion of my having the foul Di&s;temper, continued he, I &s;hould never have been able to look up any more; but now you give me &s;o much Comfort, that I even de&s;pi&s;e all my late Di&s;ap|pointments; and upon this he embraced me with the greate&s;t Tokens of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>But as no Tran&s;port can continue long without &s;ome Change or Interruption, this venerable Per|&s;on's Joys were &s;oon turn'd into a pannick Fear; for while he and I were in this plea&s;ing Conference, we were unexpectedly &s;urpriz'd by another Teacher who came to &s;ee him, and had drop'd in upon us before we were aware of him, who, &s;eeing us engag'd, made a &s;hort Compliment, and went directly to the Table where the Books lay, and taking up one of them, be|gan to read where my Patient had folded the Leaves. Any one may ea&s;ily imagine what a di&s;mal Condition the poor Par&s;on was in at this new Accident; he looked like one that was ready to go into his Grave, and ev'ry Time the other ca&s;t his Eye off the Book to &s;pit, or to take a Pinch of Snuff, he was like to &s;ink into the Ground, le&s;t he &s;hould ask him Que&s;tions; but my being there prevented that, and as I had been the In&s;trument of delivering him out of his fir&s;t Fears, I manag'd the Matter in &s;uch Man|ner as brought him &s;afely off, and delivered him out
<PB N="29" REF="32">of the la&s;t too. When I ro&s;e to go away, I de&s;ir'd him to do me the Favour to give tho&s;e Books hou&s;e-room for an Hour or two, until I could &s;end my Servant for them, which he promis'd very obliging|ly; and &s;o I left him in a fair Way of doing well.</P>
<P>I had many other Patients at this Time, be&s;ides this reverend Teacher, who had been con&s;ulting the Labours of Quacks and Mountebanks, and from thence tormenting them&s;elves with the Imagination of Symptoms and Di&s;ea&s;es they were altogether free from: Others were filled with the mo&s;t mon&s;trous Conceits that perhaps were ever heard of. But this I ob&s;erv'd was a Relief to many, and the Flit|ings of their Imaginations not only pre&s;erv'd them from de&s;perate Practices, but help'd greatly to wear out the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions, by changing them into o|thers, which, as they were in them&s;elves ab&s;urd and ridiculous, &s;o they were the more ea&s;ily vanqui&s;h'd and overcome. But it was quite otherwi&s;e with &s;ome, who&s;e Expectations had been rais'd higher than to admit of any the lea&s;t Di&s;appointment. The &s;ud|den Stop that was put to their ambitious De&s;ires, like an Eclip&s;e, had &s;o darken'd their Rea&s;on, that, to them, all Things put on quite different Appearances from what they were really in Nature, and the Ideas of Things were altogether chang'd from what they had been formerly, on their own Imaginations. All their Pa&s;&s;ions were &s;wallowed up in Anger and Re|venge, which in that total Darkne&s;s they were &s;ome|times eager to practi&s;e upon them&s;elves, from Want of Power and Ability to exerci&s;e it on others.</P>
<P>The following is an eminent Example of this kind, it being the Ca&s;e of a Gentleman, who was a very con&s;iderable Adventurer in the <HI>South Sea,</HI> but had chiefly increa&s;ed his Stock upon the Favour and Cre|dit of others, and, from a Per&s;on of narrow Circum|&s;tances, was in a little Time advanced to a very &s;ur|prizing Fortune. But the higher the Precipice, the
<PB N="30" REF="33">more terrible and dangerous the Fall. This Gentle|man had conceiv'd great Things from his new Ac|qui&s;itions; but upon his being baulk'd and di&s;appoint|ed, he was &s;eiz'd with the wor&s;t Di&s;orders that can happen to Mankind.</P>
<P>When I came to vi&s;it him, he look'd exceeding wild, and &s;eem'd altogether out of his Sen&s;es, &s;o that I found it in vain to ask him any Que&s;tions; for he &s;eldom made An&s;wer, and when he did, it was little to the purpo&s;e: But one, whom he had lately hir'd to be his <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> gave me the follow|ing Account of his Condition. He inform'd me, when the Stocks were high, his Ma&s;ter us'd to be at <HI>Change</HI> all Day, in a perpetual Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and at Night he drank very hard, went late to Bed, and was up again betimes in the Morning, &s;o that he took very little Re&s;t, and was hardly cool for three Months together: He ob&s;erv'd him to alter daily from what he was when he came fir&s;t to live with him; for he was then a Man of a pretty even Temper; but lately, he &s;aid he was &s;ometimes in &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions there was no &s;peaking to him, and at other times, he was &s;o familiar and ea&s;y, that any one would have taken him to be the be&s;t natur'd Gentleman in the World. He told me he had be&s;poke an extraor|dinary fine Coach, and a great deal of rich Furni|ture, for which he was to pay a very high Price; &s;ome of the&s;e Goods were &s;ent home to him, and for others he had laid down Money before-hand: he had al&s;o bought an E&s;tate of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, at 40 Years Purcha&s;e, to be paid upon drawing out his Money, which he intended again&s;t next <HI>Candlema&s;s,</HI> and had laid him&s;elf under an Obligation of paying 10000 Pounds for Performance of his Contract. But his not being able to fulfil the half of his Engage|ments, his Servant told me, had been the Cau&s;e of all his Di&s;orders, which, he &s;aid, were become &s;o great, that he was afraid to &s;erve him any longer, for he
<PB N="31" REF="34">had &s;everal times attempted to lay violent Hands on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I order'd him to be bled immediately, to be purg'd gently for &s;everal Days, and all that Time to make u&s;e of &s;ome Cephalicks, which I al&s;o pre&s;crib'd for him. I charg'd them to keep him from all manner of Noi&s;e and Company, and when I had al&s;o given Directions concerning his Diet, I left him.</P>
<P>When I was got upon the Stairs, I heard a great Noi&s;e of Tongues in the Parlour, and above all the re&s;t, a Woman's Voice, who &s;eem'd to be in abun|dance of Sorrow and Affliction: One of the Servants told me, &s;he was his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who, he &s;aid, was &s;o much engag'd, that &s;he could not come up Stairs while I was with his Ma&s;ter. As I was going along the Entry, I over-heard one &s;ay to her, I could have depended on your Husband, Madam, for more than I am worth in the World; &s;ays another, Your Hu&s;|band has quite ruin'd and undone me; I never made the lea&s;t doubt but he was worth 400000 <HI>l.</HI> a third call'd out, I will freely give you a Di&s;charge in full, if you'll be &s;o kind as to let me have my own Goods back again. As I went out of Doors, two Men that were leaning over the Pales, and look'd like Ruffians, &s;tarted up; one of them made towards the Door; but the other call'd out, Back, (whom I perceiv'd to be a Bailiff) and as I cro&s;s'd the Way to a Hackney-Coach that waited for a Fare, I ob&s;erv'd two Men more, with great Sticks in their Hands, and Hand|kerchiefs about their Necks, &s;tart from behind a Cor|ner, and were coming towards me; but another hem'd to them from an Ale-Hou&s;e that was hard by, which turn'd them back again.</P>
<P>When I was &s;eated in the Coach, I de&s;ired the Coachman to drive to Sir <HI>Anthony Wheel</HI>'s, where I had a Call to go with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition. After which, I began to be in a great deal of Concern for the mi&s;erable Condition of that Family, and of many o|thers,
<PB N="32" REF="35">that had lately been plung'd into the like Circum&s;tances, tho' at the &s;ame time, I could not but condemn the incon&s;iderate Ra&s;hne&s;s and Folly of &s;ome of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, as having brought an innume|rable Train of Evils upon them&s;elves. Their Suffer|ings were indeed great, but would not have been &s;o, or perhaps none at all, had they not ty'd them&s;elves in a thou&s;and ridiculous Engagements, and, upon a fal&s;e Pre&s;umption of being rich, run into many unne|ce&s;&s;ary Debts and Expences, which might have well been &s;par'd, till their Affairs were brought to a more certain I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>While I was bu&s;ied in tho&s;e Reflections, the Coach &s;top'd, but could not come near the Door, becau&s;e of a great Crowd, who, hearing of Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Indi&s;|po&s;ition, were gather'd about the Hou&s;e to know how he did. But mo&s;t of tho&s;e Per&s;ons had earne&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, which made them &s;o inqui&s;itive about his Health.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> is a Man advanc'd to that Period of Life, which, <HI>Horace</HI> tells us, is rul'd by Gain and Am|bition; he has been all along, 'till now, of a very healthful Con&s;titution, which, no doubt, was owing to his way of Living; for he had been in con&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s of one kind or another from his Youth. He was taught betimes to read, write, and ca&s;t Ac|compts; and upon his fir&s;t &s;etting out into the World, he was employ'd as a Secretary to many of his Neigh|bours, who had not the Advantage of &s;o liberal an Education; wherein he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well, that it was reported of him, no Man could fill up a Bond or Indenture with greater Ability: But his main Talent lay in Accompts; and altho' he never was in&s;tructed under any Tutor, further than &s;ome few Decimal Fractions, yet he became exceedingly enamour'd with Figures, as they were the Types and Repre&s;entatives of that which he lov'd next to his Life. The Beauties that lay hid under tho&s;e pretty
<PB N="33" REF="36">Devices were &s;o great a Spur to his Indu&s;try, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ould never give over varying their Po&s;itions, till he became more acquainted with the Powers of Num|bers than any one before him, in&s;omuch that he was the fir&s;t who di&s;cover'd to the World how many Changes might be rung on Twelve Bells. He was al&s;o &s;aid to be the fir&s;t who could practi&s;e <HI>Leger-du-Main</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y Figures, and in this he even excell'd the mo&s;t cele|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rated Arti&s;ts; for mo&s;t that tho&s;e Per&s;ons could do, was only to bring Counters out of Peoples Pockets, and make them believe they were Money; But Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> could bring out real Sterling, and make them believe it to be only Counters, which he would in Time turn to Money.</P>
<P>The&s;e Accompli&s;hments &s;oon brought him into Fa|vour with a noted Magician of great Power and Au|thority, who always practis'd with a <HI>Lituus,</HI> &s;uch as the old Heathen Prie&s;ts and Augurs were wont to di|vine with; and to him became an humble Servant for &s;everal Years, during which Time, he had al&s;o great Opportunities put into his Hands of growing both Rich and Powerful, and indeed no one ever improv'd his Opportunities better; for in a little Time he a|ma&s;s'd together &s;uch a Heap of Trea&s;ure, as has been &s;eldom known in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any private Per&s;on; and at length he became to be of &s;uch Con&s;ideration, that the Eyes of all Men were upon him, and tho&s;e who had not the Opportunity of conver&s;ing with him, &s;tudied as much as po&s;&s;ible to follow his Example.</P>
<P>But this uncommon Regard, which the World paid him, at la&s;t prov'd his Bane; as it led him in|to many Things that were ridiculous and extrava|gant; for he was proud and ambitious by Nature, which he improv'd to &s;uch a Degree of Haughtine&s;s, that he even made Princes and Nobles &s;toop before him; and if any Man truly had his Ear, it was his old Ma&s;ter or his Friends, who &s;eldom came openly, but were always convey'd to him by &s;ome magical
<PB N="34" REF="37">Device, which rendered them invi&s;ible to others. His old Ma&s;ter was the only Per&s;on whom he ever admir'd for his great Abilities, but his Confidence in his own, at la&s;t very far overcame the E&s;teem he had formerly of his Ma&s;ter's Talents; in&s;omuch that he has been known to laugh at him when his Back was turn'd, and to call him an ignorant Impo&s;tor; becau&s;e he had oftentimes help'd him out by his Numbers, when the Heavens pre&s;ented no favourable Omen. In fine, he became &s;o pre&s;umptuous, that he thought he could do every Thing by his Calculations, and even at|tempted to &s;quare the Circle; believing that extraor|dinary Task had been re&s;erv'd for him, becau&s;e the Circle bore &s;ome Analogy to his own Name.</P>
<P>His ordinary Maxims were about Money, or the Relatives to it: He us'd to &s;ay, Money was the Sup|port of Kings and Princes. That no Government could &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. That it gave Power and Au|thority to all Men, and was &s;o precious a Jewel, that &s;o the World was kept in Ignorance, as to the Means, it &s;ignify'd but little how a Man came by it. That Wit was but a Fla&s;h, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons were general|ly poor who had mo&s;t of it, and that which Divines and Philo&s;ophers call Wi&s;dom, was really Folly; for it was always accompany'd with &s;uch a &s;crupulous Preci&s;ene&s;s, that it hindred Men from doing Ju&s;tice to them&s;elves. That Mode&s;ty, however admir'd by &s;peculative Per&s;ons, was neverthele&s;s unbecoming a Man, as it kept tho&s;e, who were reputed &s;o, always un|der the Hatches; but that it was a Qualification well enough &s;uited to Women. That all Learning, excep|ting that which enabled a Man to look after his own Affairs, was no other than Madne&s;s; and &s;erv'd only to make People trouble&s;ome to them&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible, that a Man of this Turn and Di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould lie idle and unactive in our national Concerns, after the extraordinary Footing they were lately put upon. He therefore appear'd among the
<PB N="35" REF="38">fir&s;t on the new E&s;tabli&s;hment, and became one of the greate&s;t Adventurers, as he judg'd, nothing could be more likely to bring him to a full Gratification of his Wi&s;hes. But the &s;udden and unexpected Turn of tho&s;e Affairs gave a deadly Blow to all his Ex|pectations. Many of his Betters, who had &s;ome time ago &s;toop'd to his in&s;ulting Arrogance, were now no ways backward in cen&s;uring his Conduct, and mo&s;t Peoples Thoughts were filled with Jealou&s;y, that his Practices had not been &s;o laudable as they ought to have been. His Abilities were al&s;o canva&s;&s;ed, and his laborious Calculations condemn'd as empty and chimerical. All which Afflictions coming together upon Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> brought him into a very bad State both in Body and Mind.</P>
<P>When I enter'd his Room, I ob&s;erv'd it was very &s;pacious, and every Thing in it as &s;umptuous as the rich Furniture de&s;crib'd in <HI>Dido</HI>'s Palace. He was him&s;elf &s;eated in a Chair covered with Crim&s;on Vel|vet, fring'd with Gold, and over his Head was a Canopy of the &s;ame finely wrought. I could not well at fir&s;t divine, who&s;e Pre&s;ence I was come into, and therefore I made him a more profound Obei|&s;ance than what is u&s;ually expected from one of my Profe&s;&s;ion and Years. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he ask'd my Bu&s;ine&s;s. I told him I had a Me&s;&s;age that Morning from him, and was going to enquire into his Indi&s;po&s;ition; when he interrupted me, &s;aying he had &s;o many came to him upon Bu&s;ine&s;s and Me&s;|&s;ages, that his Life was no better than that of a Por|ter. Upon this he call'd his Servant to bid one of his Stewards come to him; whereupon an elderly Per&s;on &s;oon entered the Room, who&s;e Face I knew very well, and immediately I recollected, that I had &s;een him often upon the Exchange, and that he was a very noted Broker. He ask'd how much Stock he had &s;old that Day? but the old Man tip'd him the Wink, and then went and whi&s;pered him in the Ear,
<PB N="36" REF="39">yet &s;o as I could overhear him. He told him there was no Market, and that the Buyers were all gone to the Devil, that now the Word &s;ignify'd nothing, for no body under&s;tood it. What, &s;ays he, not 1500 <HI>per Cent.</HI> again&s;t the Payment of the next Dividend? You may as well make People believe, reply'd the Man, that Stocks will ri&s;e to 15000. Every one cries out, <HI>Who buys?</HI> But no body offers to bid any Thing. This brought Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> into a very great Di&s;order, which was accompany'd with a boundle&s;s Fit of Pa&s;|&s;ion. He &s;natch'd up an Ink-&s;tand that was on the Table, and was going to throw it at his Steward's Head; but I &s;tep'd in between and prevented him; then he ask'd me who I was. What, &s;ays he, you are the Fellow that threaten'd to murder me the other Day, I'll have you &s;ecur'd this Minute. But I beg'd his Patience, and told him that I was a Phy&s;ician; that I had practis'd in this City above five and twen|ty Years, that my Name was <HI>Midriff,</HI> and that I was very well known to Per&s;ons of all Ranks, and that he could not him&s;elf be a Stranger to my Reputation in Phy&s;ick; otherwi&s;e he would not have call'd me, when there were &s;o many <HI>learned</HI> Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion to be had every where. What, &s;aid he, was it you that &s;ent me the Do&s;e of Poi&s;on the other Day? I told him, I had only been call'd the &s;ame Morning, but as yet had order'd nothing for him. By this Time the Servant came into the Room, who had been to fetch me, and went to confirm what I had &s;aid; but he was in &s;o dreadful a Condition, that he could neither bear any one to be in his Pre&s;ence, neither dur&s;t he be by him&s;elf; he &s;natch'd up the Stand again, and before I could do any Thing to pre|vent him, he hit the Servant with it; for he was grown jealous of all Per&s;ons that were about him, and believ'd they had enter'd into a Confederacy a|gain&s;t him. When they were all gone, he looked &s;tedfa&s;tly upon me; but being afraid to offer me any
<PB N="37" REF="40">Violence, and equally dreading to tru&s;t him&s;elf in my Company alone; he therefore fled out of the Room with a great deal of Precipitation, and &s;hut him&s;elf up in another.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e Signs, I found Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s, Di&s;temper border'd upon Lunacy, and that there was no ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">k|ing to him, his Imaginations were &s;o wholly fix'd up|on his Di&s;appointments; tho' he could not really re|collect within him&s;elf, at that Time, what they were, or how they had happen'd: He thought him&s;elf in|jur'd and undone, but by whom, or in what Manner, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him now to conceive, &s;o great was his Di&s;turbance: Nor is it altogether improba|ble, but he might have a Con&s;cience and Dread of his having injur'd others, who were ready to take their Revenge: And tho' this may not be real, yet &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions are often made or the Minds of lu|natick Per&s;ons, merely from the common Fame of o|thers, which, at la&s;t, &s;ettles into a firm Belief; and it, no doubt, proceeded from &s;uch extravagant Con|ceits, that he look'd upon all Per&s;ons, without Di&s;|tinction, to be his Enemies.</P>
<P>When I came down Stairs, I found &s;everal of his Stewards not a little dejected at the Misfortunes which had happen'd to their Ma&s;ter. One of them had been my Acquaintance many Years; and as I was willing to leave &s;ome Directions, I made towards him, and told him all that had happen'd to Sir <HI>Antho|ny;</HI> and at the &s;ame time I de&s;ir'd &s;ome Care might be taken of him; that he &s;hould be immediately bled, to the Quantity of Ten Ounces, and that afterwards they &s;hould not &s;uffer him to be by him&s;elf a Minute; for it might be hazardous, e&s;pecially, if there were either Knives or Garters in the way. I told him likewi&s;e, how dangerous this Sea&s;on was above all o|ther Times of the Year; but that as the Weather was become more &s;erene, he might probably grow better. But my Friend was very much &s;tartled at
<PB N="38" REF="41">the&s;e Sayings; for he could not imagine how a Man of &s;o much Sen&s;e could be in &s;uch a Condition: What, &s;ays he, do yon look upon Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> to be mad? I an&s;wer'd, Not directly mad, tho' at the &s;ame Time, I could not judge his Ca&s;e to be much different from that of a Lunatick at pre&s;ent. To this my Friend reply'd, That it was impo&s;&s;ible, for he had for many Years been accounted a very long-headed Man, and had been able to go through Bu&s;ine&s;s that no Man could manage but him&s;elf, and that the able&s;t State&s;|men had always commended his Abilities. I &s;aid, that was not at all to be doubted of; for the Com|mendations of State&s;men were &s;eldom wanting to tho&s;e who could &s;erve a pre&s;ent Turn, tho' the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s it&s;elf might neither be difficult, nor yet well|managed in all Points: But that, I told him, was not very much to the purpo&s;e; for &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a Man of never &s;o great Dexterity in Bu&s;ine&s;s, it could be no Argument why he &s;hould not be liable to the &s;ame Maladies as other Men. Then my Ac|quaintance ask'd me, What I meant by taking care that there &s;hould be no Knives or Garters in the way? Do you believe, &s;aid he, that he is &s;o melancholy as to make away with him&s;elf? All the An&s;wer I made to this was, That People could never be too much upon their Guard, with re&s;pect to any one in &s;uch Circum&s;tances: Upon this he left me with all the Ha&s;te imaginable to fa&s;ten the Windows; for the Thought came luckily into his Head, that unle&s;s they were &s;o &s;ecur'd as Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> could not open 'em, he might, perhaps, leap out and break his Neck.</P>
<P>The Day following, I made him another Vi&s;it, and found him much alter'd for the better, after a Vein had been open'd. I was told he became excee|ding thir&s;ty, and drank above a Quart of white Moun|tain, at &s;everal Times, mix'd with Water, which dos'd him to &s;uch a Degree, that at la&s;t he fell into a &s;ound Sleep, which continued for the Space of nine
<PB N="39" REF="42">Hours. This had carried off the <HI>Delirium,</HI> &s;o that he was now become pretty &s;en&s;ible; and as &s;oon as I came into the Room, he began to make an Apology for his rude Treatment of me the Day before, which had been told him by the People that were about him. He &s;aid he had been in a very &s;trange Condi|tion; but it was &s;o much like a confus'd Dream, that he could hardly remember any thing of it, excepting only, that he imagin'd there were a great many Peo|ple gather'd about the Hou&s;e to kill him, mo&s;t of whom were Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, and &s;ome, as he thought, were no le&s;s than Knights of the Garter; and moreover he believ'd firmly, that his own Ser|vants were in League with them, and had engag'd to deliver him up. I ob&s;erv'd to him, that &s;uch Ima|ginations were very u&s;ual to Per&s;ons in his Circum|&s;tances, and that it was a Sign his Mind had been ex|ceedingly &s;haken, but that he mu&s;t endeavour to learn a little more Fortitude, this being a Juncture which required him to exert all the noble Qualities he was Ma&s;ter of. At this he made me a Bow with his Head, and, with an obliging Air, he al&s;o thank'd me for the good Opinion I had of him. I was a little &s;urpriz'd at fir&s;t what his Meaning was, and began to fear a Relap&s;e; but I &s;oon found he was only un|der a Mi&s;take, and had apply'd the Epithet <HI>Noble</HI> o|therwi&s;e than I intended it. But as I never love to flatter my Patients to their own Prejudice, I ventur'd to put him in the right in this Particular. I ob&s;erv'd, that we had all of us noble Qualities implanted in us by Nature, tho' the far greater Number employ'd them to di&s;honourable and ignoble Purpo&s;es; and I doubt not, but a Per&s;on, &s;uch as he was, who had gone thro' &s;o many different Scenes of Li&s;e, and had been &s;o much conver&s;ant among Men, mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ible of this in the Practice of the World. And I was going to ob&s;erve how u&s;eful and noble a Qua|lity Fortitude was, and what Virtues were required
<PB N="40" REF="43">in us before we could arrive to any tolerable degree of it; but he interrupted me, and &s;aid, tho&s;e Things were indeed very fine to talk of; tho', as to his own Part, he never troubled him&s;elf with Mens good or e|vil Qualities, any further than to take care they &s;hould not hurt him with them if po&s;&s;ible. Then he ask'd me if I could order him any Thing that could do him good, for he found him&s;elf mighty &s;ubject to a Trembling, and was apt to &s;tart and be &s;urpriz'd at every Thing. I told him, all that Phy&s;ick could do in that Ca&s;e &s;ignified but little, for his Di&s;temper was really more in his Mind than Body; that his Body indeed &s;uffered, but that was only &s;econdari|ly, and if his Mind could be brought into a right Compo&s;ure, the other would &s;oon be freed from its pre&s;ent Indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Tho' he all this while had an&s;wer'd as rational|ly as was u&s;ual to him at other Times, yet I ob|&s;erved a very great Di&s;turbance in his Looks by Inter|vals, and he was ready, upon every &s;light occa&s;ion, to fall into unrea&s;onable Pa&s;&s;ions with his Servants; whereupon I advis'd him not to &s;uffer every little Offence to di&s;compo&s;e him, for that would be the ready means to aggravate his Di&s;orders, whereas a contrary Habit would help greatly to le&s;&s;en them. But while I was expo&s;tulating with him in this man|ner, we were &s;uddenly alarm'd with a Noi&s;e in the Street, which brought him into a fre&s;h <HI>Deli|rium;</HI> it was nothing but the Mob was gathered about a Pick-Pocket, whom the Officers were carry|ing before a Magi&s;trate; but when Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> heard their Tongues very loud, as is u&s;ual upon &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions, he &s;tar'd and began to look exceeding wild, and all of a &s;udden leaping from his Chair, he went to hide him&s;elf. It was with much difficulty we could beat this new Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion out of his Head, becau&s;e the Impre&s;&s;ions were made very deep but the Day before. He believ'd his Adver&s;aries had
<PB N="41" REF="44">now laid clo&s;e Siege to the Hou&s;e, and he often cal|led out with a bellowing Voice to &s;ee that all the Doors were &s;ecured; but when he found there was nothing real in all this, he &s;eated him&s;elf again in his Chair, and turn'd very dumpi&s;h, which is the u&s;ual Re&s;ult of Fear, Anger and De&s;pair, which, as has been ob&s;erv'd, ordinarily bear the a&s;cendant in all &s;uch melancholy Di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>After this, I call'd upon him &s;everal Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly, and pre&s;crib'd what I judg'd proper by way of Phy&s;ick; but I was more particularly &s;olicitous in what concern'd his Diet, and as he was a Man of a &s;ome|what plethorick Habit of Body, and lately become more than ordinarily addicted to Pa&s;&s;ion, I look'd upon Ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s to be the likelie&s;t Means to bring that under, and therefore I order'd him &s;uch Food as was of ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, and at the &s;ame time afforded but moderate Nouri&s;hment: This Me|thod was attended with &s;o much Succe&s;s, that he mended &s;o far as to go abroad, for his Affairs were urgent, and very much required his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>But it is next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to effectuate a perfect Cure on any one in Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Circum&s;tances, for he is really but a Man of a weak Mind and little Knowledge. He had indeed, like many other &s;uper|ficial Per&s;ons, gain'd a very great Reputation among Men, yet that was only taken from outward Shew and Appearance, and not from any Virtue or Abili|ty, wherein he had excelled others; but as he had al|ways been in con&s;tant Employment, his Mind was wholly taken off from many of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Concerns which the more numerous part of Mankind are of|ten engag'd in. This had created a Severity in his Looks, which was accompanied with an Air and Semblance of Wi&s;dom, &s;ufficient to impo&s;e on all who had not a perfect Intimacy and Acquaintance with him. But it appears, now the Mask is taken off, that he is no other than a meer Pedant in Bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="42" REF="45">and one who, like the blind Hor&s;e in a Mill, went as &s;ure and as &s;teady as the mo&s;t quick &s;ighted could have done, &s;o long as he kept plodding and drudging in his u&s;ual Round of Affairs; for then all was with|in the compa&s;s of his Under&s;tanding. But when Pride, Avarice, and Ambition (the con&s;tant Com|panions of our fir&s;t-rate Fools) had once carried him beyond that Circle, he was &s;oon bewilder'd in a Maze of Difficulties, while his perplex'd Mind was no ways &s;ea&s;on'd with tho&s;e Virtues that were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to extricate and &s;et him at Liberty.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Time I went to him, I found his Condi|tion &s;till altered, tho' I cannot &s;ay it was a great deal for the better. He was not indeed &s;o much afraid of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and Con&s;piracies as he had been be|fore, and I perceiv'd he was not &s;o ea&s;ily alarumd at Noi&s;es in the Street; but I found a new Calamity had taken hold of him, and tho' it did not &s;eem di|rectly to point at his Life, yet it touch'd that which was as dear to him, <HI>viz.</HI> his Money and his Repu|tation. He told me he was grown wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and that he hop'd &s;ome People would be quiet when they had made an end of him. Upon this I went to feel his Pul&s;e, for he had a pretty high Colour in his Face, which made me believe he was feveri&s;h, or el&s;e that he had been drinking. When I was coming towards him, he &s;tarted, looked me broad in the Face, and ask'd me ha&s;tily, what I was going to do. I told him I intended nothing that would hurt him, and with that I took hold of his Wri&s;t. I found him a little feveri&s;h, which I judge might be occa&s;ion'd by the great di&s;turbance of his Thoughts, which had kept him from Sleep. After which, I ask'd him who tho&s;e were he was now &s;o much afraid of? He an&s;wered, they were Per&s;ons of &s;ome Note, whom he had once in his Life-time obliged very much, but he found they had neither Honour nor Gratitude in them. They envy'd the little Acqui&s;itions he had
<PB N="43" REF="46">made, and could never be &s;atisfied, unle&s;s a Man wou'd give up all he had ever toil'd and labour'd for. He &s;aid they had &s;uborn'd fal&s;e Witne&s;s to &s;wear again&s;t him, that he had us'd many ill Practices, and been a bad Example to others; and that they might put him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s great Expence, and bring him under as much Ig|nominy and Di&s;grace as po&s;&s;ible, they would oblige him to build a Scaffold in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall</HI> for his own Tryal. Well, an&s;wer'd I, what have you further to &s;ay? To &s;ay, reply'd Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> a great deal. Tho&s;e very Men and I were exceeding friendly but a little while ago; they complimented me, and I did Favours for them, and many of their Friends too; they often told me what a u&s;eful Subject I was, and how great a &s;hare I had in his Maje&s;ty's Favour; and that they never omitted to &s;peak a good Word for me as often as they had an Opportunity. But now, &s;aid he, I know by their Looks they have a mind to ruin me, and &s;ome of them even u&s;e oblique Threatnings to my Face. I began by this time to believe that Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> gave Credit to his own Dreams, and indeed I could hardly forbear being out of Humour, to hear him talk at this extravagant Rate. I therefore de|&s;ired him to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and not &s;uffer &s;uch idle Fancies to run in his Head, for there was nothing at all in them. In them, &s;aid he, don't you hear it talk'd in all Places wherever you come? I was not a Stranger to the Rumours that were &s;pread about the Town concerning Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Conduct; but I thought it not proper to make him a direct An&s;wer. I ob|&s;erv'd to him, that we were all of us liable to Mi&s;|carriages as often as we pre&s;um'd ra&s;hly to go out of our limited Bounds. That we were naturally apt to do this, from an over-fond Conceit and Opinion of our own Merits and Abilities. That we long'd to be at tho&s;e things which were placed at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from us, and, like <HI>Icharus,</HI> we often plung'd our&s;elves into an Ocean of Troubles, while we at|tempted
<PB N="44" REF="47">to fly up to the Sun with Wings of our own making. I took notice, that many of us were too forward to fix our Hopes on an imaginary Good, and from a too eager De&s;ire after it, made u&s;e of indirect Means to obtain it. This, I &s;aid, might undoubtedly be the rea&s;on why &s;uch Per&s;ons, when their Expecta|tions fail them, were commonly to&s;&s;ed about with the Imagination of Evils, which had their Being no where &s;o much as in the Mind. But Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> took all this as apply'd to him&s;elf, and with a Smile, which at the &s;ame time carried an Air of Di&s;&s;atisfac|tion and Contempt, ask'd me what he had ever a&s;pi|red after that was imaginary. I know, &s;aid he, you Philo&s;ophers often account tho&s;e Things imaginary, that other People find to be real; you reckon Mo|ney an imaginary Good, but &s;hew me what you or any Man can do without it. Honour and Greatne&s;s, I know, are al&s;o cla&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Rank, according to your preci&s;e way of thinking, but let me &s;ee the Man will refu&s;e either when offer'd to him. I made an&s;wer, that there was, no doubt, a real Good in all tho&s;e Things, when they were put to their right and proper U&s;e, and that Peoples De&s;ires were moderate in them, and their De&s;igns truly honourable: And I was going on, to tell him what it was that, in my Judgment, render'd them evil. But he interrupted me, and &s;aid, he did not &s;ee but every Body was for getting all they could, and what Rea&s;on was there that he &s;hould be behind hand, &s;ince he had perhaps de&s;erv'd like other Men; but e&s;pecially the World be|ing come to that pa&s;s, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons were only trampled upon, or &s;et light by, who were not in &s;ome Degree of Power or Authority. I could not but own what he had ob&s;erv'd was oftentimes too true, if meant with re&s;pect to Men in narrow Circum|&s;tances, and inferior Station. But yet I &s;aid that was no Argument, why &s;uch as wanted nothing, and were even got above the In&s;ults of the World, &s;hould a&s;pire
<PB N="45" REF="48">further, unle&s;s it was purely, that they might be able to do the more Good. If after this, they were prompted by any other Motives to advance their Station, than what proceeded from a truly publick Spirit, I ob&s;erv'd that they were mo&s;t commonly bad ones. I &s;aid, moreover, that no Man could be real|ly happy, in the Enjoyment of his Acqui&s;itions, ei|ther of Riches, or from any outward Marks of Di|&s;tinction confer'd upon him, without tho&s;e Requi&s;ites, that bear the true Stamp of Nobility; <HI>viz.</HI> a Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of noble and virtuous Actions; and where|ever that Te&s;timony was wanting in an exalted Con|dition, I &s;aid, it was generally attended with a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s. I concluded, that Titles were, at be&s;t, e&s;teem'd but meer Pageantry, when they were not &s;upported with true Genero&s;ity; and, whatever a vain Per&s;on in unde&s;erved Honours might think of him&s;elf, he was in the Eyes of all wi&s;e Men accoun|ted no better than a Figure of Wax, robed in Purple, or a prophane Image &s;et up to be wor&s;hip'd, tho' it has not the lea&s;t Shadow or Appearance of a Deity.</P>
<P>I could not avoid expo&s;tulating with Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> in this Manner, and likewi&s;e be&s;towing on him &s;ome grave Admonitions; becau&s;e I found his Heart whol|ly &s;et upon Nobility, an Honour whereunto he had no ju&s;t Title, nor indeed any Likelihood of enjoying it. Yet all my Arguments could not avail &s;o as to bring him to any Sen&s;e of his Folly; for he was too far gone in that Delirium to brook the Di&s;appoint|ment: He had, not long ago, &s;o &s;trong a Pre&s;umption of being made a Peer; and his Mind was &s;o highly tran&s;ported with the Hopes of it, that he had drawn up the Form of a Preamble, &s;uch as he, no doubt, flatter'd him&s;elf would be made on the Entry to his own Patent. This I accidentally ob&s;erv'd to lie o|pen upon his Table, among &s;ome other Papers; for I was &s;o near that I could peru&s;e &s;ome part of it; but looking upon it to be no le&s;s hurtful while in his Sight, than Wine to a Man who is already drunk; I
<PB N="46" REF="49">therefore, as the be&s;t Office I could do him, waited an Opportunity to deprive him of that Idol; and ve|ry luckily, when his Face was turn'd from me, I took it up, and put it in my Pocket unob&s;erv'd, and have now committed it to the publick, with the &s;ame marginal Notes that were upon it; becau&s;e it will give the curious Reader &s;ome further In&s;ight into his Condition. It is as follows:</P>
<P>If a noble and ancient Pedigree has always been accounted a great Advance in the Way to Honour and Nobility, our<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">When I come to be a Peer, all publick Writings from the King's Maje&s;ty will run, <HI>To our tru&s;ty and well-beloved Cou&s;in and Coun&s;ellour.</HI></NOTE> tru&s;ty and well-beloved <HI>Anthony Wheel,</HI> Knt. mu&s;t, in that re&s;pect, be &s;ufficient|ly recommended to us, as he is a Per&s;on of no mean or ignoble Ex|traction, but &s;prung from the an|cient Race of the <HI>Wheels;</HI> a Family, which tho' it has for many Ages pa&s;t &s;trove with the Iniquities of For|tune, yet, by its frequent Alliances with tho&s;e of the be&s;t Blood, derives a no &s;mall Honour on all its wor|thy De&s;cendants.&mdash;And if we al&s;o put a Value on the Goods of Fortune, as the&s;e are the Means to en|able Per&s;ons in the highe&s;t Stations, as well to &s;upport their great Dignity, as to render them the more con|&s;picuous Patrons of their Country, he mu&s;t no le&s;s de|&s;erve our high Regard on that Account, having by his own proper Merit arriv'd at &s;uch large Acqui&s;i|tions, as may vie with the greate&s;t of our Peers; and therefore may well become the Repre&s;entative of &s;uch worthy Ance&s;tors, who&s;e almo&s;t extingui&s;h'd Fame is again happily reviv'd in him; and the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Memorandum,</HI> To look into <HI>Baker</HI>'s Chronicle, or &s;ome other good Hi&s;tory, to know what Services the <HI>Wheels</HI> have done to their Country.</NOTE> Name of <HI>Wheel,</HI> by his un|wearied Diligence, become once more of no &s;mall Account in the&s;e our ancient Dominions.&mdash;But if a continued Series of great and laudable Actions can be &s;ufficient to derive Titles of Honour and Nobility on tho&s;e who have travell'd
<PB N="47" REF="50">long, and pa&s;s'd through the be&s;t Stages of their Lives in the Service of their native Country, the &s;aid Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> mu&s;t undoubtedly claim a ju&s;t Title to tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of our Royal Favour, he having not only given us many &s;ignal Proofs of his uncommon Abilities in divers con&s;iderable and weighty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I am afraid I can|not have this Charac|ter, unle&s;s I be put in|to &s;ome pretty hand|&s;ome Po&s;t for a little while.</NOTE> Employments, but by his &s;trict Fidelity, a&s;&s;iduous Care, and indefatigable Indu&s;try, render'd him|&s;elf mo&s;t dear unto us, and mo&s;t de|&s;ervedly e&s;teem'd by all our good and faithful Subjects. And if tho&s;e Per&s;ons are highly to be accounted of, who in all Times of Danger be|come notable In&s;truments in Defence of their Coun|try, tho' to the utmo&s;t Hazard of their Lives; and, if be&s;ides the Glory they thereby purcha&s;e to them|&s;elves, ought al&s;o to receive all due Honour from us, as a further Reward of their Valour and noble At|chievements; &s;o we ought by no means to pa&s;s by unregarded the extraordinary Merit of &s;uch of our good and Loyal Subjects, who being Ma&s;ters of very large and uncommon Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, are no le&s;s ready to venture them in a Time of need. This truly publick Spirit has mo&s;t manife&s;tly &s;hewn it &s;elf, in many ex|traordinary and &s;ingular In&s;tances of Sir <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Life; but more e&s;pecially by his hearty Zeal and Readine&s;s to redeem the Debts of the Nation, having, like a true-hearted <HI>Briton,</HI> &s;et a notable and great Pat|tern to many others of our wealthy Subjects, by who&s;e joint Endeavours, the great Burden, which by a long and nece&s;&s;ary War lies &s;o heavy upon us, is now like to be &s;oon le&s;&s;ened, and our good Subjects ea&s;ed of many &s;ore and grievous Taxes, which are very oppre&s;&s;ive upon them.&mdash;But if we al&s;o regard the &s;aid Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> with re&s;pect to many other Qualifications and Endowments, which recommend tho&s;e who are advanced unto the highe&s;t Honours, the Portline&s;s of his Per&s;on, and &s;tately Behaviour, ought not to be overlooked. We commend &s;ome for
<PB N="48" REF="51">their Politene&s;s, &s;ome for their Affability, and others for their courtly Deportment. But Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> is a Per&s;on, who&s;e noble and &s;tately Carriage be&s;peaks the real Greatne&s;s of his Mind; he knowing full well at all times, how to keep up that Awe and Reve|rence, which is &s;o highly becoming an exalted Sta|tion. For the&s;e and many other publick and private Virtues, &s;o manife&s;t in Sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> be&s;ides his known Loyalty to our Royal Per&s;on and Family, (ever &s;ince our Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne) we have thought fit to call him to the Dignity of a Peer of our Realm, by the Name and Title of <HI>Antho|ny Lord Wheel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The &s;ame Title will an&s;wer very well to Earl, or Duke; for <HI>Wheelburrow</HI> &s;ounds like <HI>Marlburrow.</HI></NOTE> Baron of <HI>Wheel|burrow.</HI> And we do hereby, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I was told, Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> had al&s;o intoxicated his Brains with many other Things; &s;uch as u&s;ually tickle the Fancies of vain and pre&s;umptuous Per&s;ons, and altho' he was as great a Lover of Money as any Man could well be, yet no one was more lavi&s;h when it tended to the Gratification of his vain and ambitious De&s;ires; but among many others, I &s;hall only name this one In|&s;tance, which I had from my old Acquaintance; and that was concerning his Picture, which was to be drawn at full Length, with the Frame all of pure Sil|ver finely gilt; for this he had agreed to pay a very extraordinary Sum, but it was put off for a Time, and very probably until he was made a Peer, that he might be painted in his Robes.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 22. I was call'd to <HI>Robert Pitfal</HI> E&s;q. a coun|try Gentleman, who had faln &s;ick at an Inn. He was a Man near forty, and of a &s;eemingly robu&s;t Con&s;titution, and of a hail Country Complexion, &s;o that I could not perceive any great Symptoms of Sickne&s;s, excepting only, that I found his Pul&s;e &s;ome|what di&s;orderly: I therefore ask'd him very particu|larly, how he found him&s;elf, and what it was he com|plain'd
<PB N="49" REF="52">of mo&s;t. He told me he had got a new Di&s;|temper he never had heard of before; and when I ask'd him what that was, he &s;aid, ev'ry Body told him he had got the Hyppo, and that they &s;aid, it was a plaguy whim&s;ical Di&s;ea&s;e, that made People be|lieve and fancy Things, and that he could not ima|gine what it could be; unle&s;s it was the &s;ame, that a Par&s;on had, of a neighbouring Pari&s;h to that where he liv'd, who us'd to fancy he had a clucking Hen in his Head, and &s;et all the Country a laughing at him. Upon this, I told him, that I hop'd he had no &s;uch Imaginations as tho&s;e. Not I, reply'd the Gentleman, but the other Night I could not lie in Bed, but was forced to get up again, and had a Fire made in my Room; and in the Morning, when I told my Land|lady how I had been, &s;he laught at me, and &s;aid, I had only got the Hyppo; and if I would keep my own Coun&s;el, no body would know I ail'd any Thing, becau&s;e I look &s;o well. But to tell you freely, &s;ays he, I believe you are half poi&s;on'd in this Town with unwhole&s;ome Food; and I am &s;ure I have eat &s;ome|thing my &s;elf that cannot dige&s;t, but lies like a hea|vy Lump of Lead in my Stomach, which oftentimes &s;wells up in my Throat like to choak me; but e&s;pe|cially when I lay my Head down upon the Pillow: And I believe, continued he, there is &s;omething in your Drink too, that &s;hould not be in it, which makes it more than ordinarily diuretick, for I make a woun|dy deal of Water lately. By the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions I found he was indeed touched with the <HI>Hyppo;</HI> and becau&s;e I ob&s;erv'd him to be one who had been us'd to eat and drink plentifully, and wanted his u&s;ual Exerci&s;e to dige&s;t it; and being of a full gro&s;s Habit of Body, and as he complain'd likewi&s;e of a Swimming and Gid|dine&s;s in his Head; I was therefore of Opinion, he might be very apt to fall into a Fit or the Apoplexy; to prevent which, I order'd him to be let Blood in the &s;ir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> Place, and after that to be vomited; I order'd
<PB N="50" REF="53">him likewi&s;e &s;ome Cephalicks. But when I had got Pen, Ink and Paper, and was ju&s;t going to write, he call'd out with a great deal of vehemence to prevent me, and &s;wore heartily, he would have no more Bills and Notes, for he had lately parted with above the half of his E&s;tate, and had got nothing but Paper for it. But when I told him I was only going to give &s;ome Directions to the Apothecary, that he might make up what was proper for his Di&s;temper, he ask'd my Pardon, and &s;aid he hop'd I would not take it ami&s;s; for the very Sight of Scraps of Paper put him almo&s;t out of his Sen&s;es. By this, I al&s;o came to know what had been the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;temper, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had, like the re&s;t of my Patients, been pretty deeply en|gag'd in the Stocks, and that Things had not &s;ucceed|ed there to his Wi&s;hes. When I was going, I de|&s;ired he might be carefull to mind my Directions, which the Apothecary would acquaint him with, and that I doubted not, but I &s;hou'd find him better in a &s;hort Time.</P>
<P>When I came the next Day, he look'd &s;omewhat out of Humour, and before I could ask him any Que&s;tions, he began to complain, &s;aying, I had al|mo&s;t kill'd him with the Vomit, that it had made him as &s;ick as a Hor&s;e, and that he had never been in &s;uch a Condition &s;ince he was born, excepting once after a fit of hard drinking with &s;ome Gentle|men at a Hor&s;e-race, where they drunk little or no|thing but a very &s;trong kind of Punch, which was made with Brandy and Whitewine without Water. By this I find, that Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> had never been much us'd to Phy&s;ick, for he al&s;o ask'd me what was the Bot|tle I had &s;ent him, and whether I had not put <HI>Scar|burrow</HI> Water in it, for he &s;aid it ta&s;ted like Mares Pi&s;s. I an&s;wered, that there were &s;ome Volatile Salts in it, which had not indeed a Ta&s;te that &s;uited every ones Palate; but at the &s;ame time I ob&s;erved to him, that the&s;e were very proper to remove that
<PB N="51" REF="54">Di&s;order of his Head he had &s;o much complain'd of, and that they would certainly be of Service to him, provided he would be &s;o far his own Friend as to continue in the U&s;e of them. To this he reply'd, that he believ'd they had done him &s;ome good already, for he had &s;lept better that Night than he had done for a Week before, and he thought his Head was not altogether &s;o cloudy as it had been, and for that rea|&s;on he &s;aid he &s;hould very willingly take the Stuff in the Bottle, or any thing el&s;e I thought proper for him, if it would not &s;et him a vomiting again. I told him I could not well avoid ordering him a Vo|mit in the Beginning, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to lay the Foundation of his Cure, but that I hop'd there would be no occa&s;ion to repeat it. After this, I ad|vis'd him to go abroad and divert him&s;elf, and as he had Hor&s;es at command, and had always been us'd to Riding and Country Exerci&s;e, I &s;aid it wou'd be of no &s;mall Service to him if he rid out once a Day into the open Air, e&s;pecially, &s;ince he had ta|ken up his Lodgings in &s;o clo&s;e a Place, and where there was &s;o much Dung and Litter. But he made an&s;wer, that he lik'd the Smell of Hor&s;e-dung better than &s;ome of our fine&s;t Gardens about <HI>London,</HI> and that he believ'd it would do him no Hurt, for he had heard &s;everal learned Men &s;ay, that nothing was more whole&s;ome than the Smell of a Muck-hill. He &s;aid he had lain one Night at Sir <HI>Thomas Courtley</HI>'s, who, he told me, was his fir&s;t Cou&s;in, but could not re&s;t for the Noi&s;e of People thumping at the Doors, and calling out continually in the Street; And be&s;ides, he ob&s;erv'd, that altho' Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was indeed very civil, yet he did not much like to be at his Hou&s;e, for he found he was always out of Humour when any Body wanted him, and us'd to chide his Servants for &s;aying he was at Home. He &s;aid, that a Man had as good be continually at Church as at Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, for no Body in the Hou&s;e &s;poke but as if they were whi&s;|pering
<PB N="52" REF="55">&s;omething that &s;hould not be heard; and when they were at Table, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> directed mo&s;t of his Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ome body el&s;e, which oblig'd him to &s;it as &s;ilent as a Stock. He added likewi&s;e, that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> commonly went away as &s;oon as Dinner was over, when it was the proper time to drink a Gla&s;s and &s;moak a Pipe; that he us'd to take his Leave very civilly, and de&s;ired him to &s;tay and divert him|&s;elf with his Wife and Daughters, who never enter|tain'd him with any thing but Tea, and that the young Hu&s;&s;eys us'd to fill him brimmers, which he believ'd was only that he might &s;cald his Fingers, on purpo&s;e to laugh at him when he was gone; and for the&s;e Rea&s;ons he lov'd to be at an Inn, where he paid for what he had, and could therefore u&s;e his Freedom: Be&s;ides, that he always lik'd to be near his Hor&s;es, for he &s;aid the People in this Town were not to be tru&s;ted. I could not indeed forbear giving my A&s;&s;ent to what Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> had &s;aid, becau&s;e I found Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> and he was of a quite different Turn and E|ducation, for an Inn is no doubt better than a Palace, where a Man is under any Re&s;traint and Confine|ment.</P>
<P>After two Days I made him another Vi&s;it, it was Night before I came, and I found him much more chearful than tho&s;e times I had &s;een him before; but he was engag'd with a Countryman of his own, who it &s;eems had been drinking <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Ale with him mo&s;t part of the Afternoon: I told him I was glad to &s;ee him look &s;o brisk, and that I hop'd he found him&s;elf better. I have been much the better, an|&s;wer'd he, for my hone&s;t Neighbour's Company, who&s;e coming to Town has perfectly reviv'd me; he lives but within three Miles of my Hou&s;e, and he is a Man that, be&s;ides &s;ome E&s;tate of his own, rents a very good Farm of a neighbouring Gentle|man, and I believe were you to go to his Hou&s;e, you would &s;ay you never met with a more hearty Wel|come;
<PB N="53" REF="56">and I'll &s;ay that for him, he always keeps a Gla&s;s of as good Ale as any Man in the County. Ay, thank God, &s;ays the Countryman, I am never without a Tub of Liquor, tho' it is not &s;o good as the Squire's, yet &s;uch homely Fare as we have, this, or any other ho|ne&s;t Gentleman &s;hould be welcome to, were they to come our Way. With that the Countryman ask|ed me if I were E&s;q; <HI>Pitfal</HI>'s Doctor. When I had &s;atisfied him in that Que&s;tion, the Countryman re|ply'd, I thought &s;o by what you &s;aid when you came fir&s;t in, and I was ju&s;t telling him of a Cure Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> in our Country advis'd my Wife to, for &s;he was much troubled with Wind, as the E&s;q; is; and that was to &s;wallow three Grains of white Pep|per whole every Night when &s;he went to Bed, and this cur'd her that &s;he has never been troubled with Wind &s;ince, more than any other Woman &s;hould be; and I believe, &s;aid he, would but the E&s;q; take that Cure, it would do him as much good as any thing. I told him black Pepper would do every bit as well as white. Ay but, &s;aid the Countryman, Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> made my Wife take white Pepper, and it was that cur'd her; and I well remember it, Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> once cur'd me of a great Surfeit which came by a Cold I catch'd when our Waters were up one <HI>Allhallontide.</HI> I came Home mi&s;erable bad, for my Mare had &s;wum with me a|bove half a Mile in the <HI>Burch-lane,</HI> and when the Dr. brought me the Phy&s;ick, I &s;aid I was &s;ure &s;uch a &s;mall thing as it would do nothing at me, for it was no bigger than a grey Pea; but I my Troth I &s;hall never forget it, for it purg'd me upwards and down|wards at lea&s;t twelve or fourteen times, and I was as well in two or three Days as ever I was in all my Life. After this, the Countryman went on in prai&s;e of Dr. <HI>Potter,</HI> and was &s;econded by Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> in all he &s;poke; he &s;aid he was a very ingenious Man, and the &s;trange&s;t Fellow in the World for finding out Peoples Di&s;ea&s;es, and for curing them &s;oon, for he
<PB N="54" REF="57">always &s;truck at the Cau&s;e; and as for broken Bones, he &s;aid he would venture to let him loo&s;e with any Man in <HI>England.</HI> I made an&s;wer, that Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> might be a very knowing Per&s;on for any thing I could &s;ay to the contrary; but at the &s;ame time I ob&s;erv'd that Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> could &s;u&s;tain no great Lo&s;s for the want of him while in <HI>London,</HI> where there were &s;o many able Profe&s;&s;ors. There is no doubt of that, re|ply'd the Countryman, for you have all the Learning here, and all the Money too. But I wi&s;h E&s;q; <HI>Pitfal</HI> very well, and the whole Family; I was one of the Stewards to the old E&s;q; his Father that Year he was made High-Sheriff of our County, and Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> was then but a Stripling; I believe he remembers it well enough, for we had as topping Doings then, as ever was known &s;ince in our Parts.</P>
<P>We frequently meet with Men in all Counties, who, be&s;ides an uncommon Dexterity in Country Affairs by their unwearied Diligence and Application, be|come Ma&s;ters of many of tho&s;e frugal Maxims of Life which are the be&s;t &s;uited to Per&s;ons in a Rural Station, by which means they al&s;o get the &s;tart of many of their Neighbours. This brings them into the Notice of &s;everal of the Country Gentlemen, while others, who were once upon a Level with them, are neglected, and the Familiarity to which they are ad|mitted, creates in them &s;uch a Boldne&s;s and Confi|dence, that they never fail, upon all Occa&s;ions, to give in their Verdict, tho' in things which are altoge|ther out of their Depth; and altho' what they &s;ay is oftentimes neither very &s;ea&s;onable, nor much to the purpo&s;e, yet all this pa&s;&s;es for the mo&s;t part without Reprehen&s;ion, as the better &s;ort are ever willing to make &s;ufficient Allowance, while the re&s;t are not al|ways competent Judges. I &s;oon ob&s;erv'd Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI>'s Country Neighbour to be one of this Stamp. He knows full well, as he imagines, how to exert his Native Property, and values him&s;elf much upon it;
<PB N="55" REF="58">and as he &s;eems to be a Man perfectly ea&s;y in his Circum&s;tances, he &s;pares not tho&s;e who keep him at his due di&s;tance, but will be often very tart in his Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t them, tho' no one is more neigh|bourly, and, as far as is agreeable to his Educa|tion and Manner of Life, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to &s;uch of his Superiors as admit him into any degree of Familiarity with them. This makes him have a more than ordinary regard for Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> who is a plain hone&s;t Country Gentleman, and lives with him no otherwi&s;e than as a good &s;ociable Neighbour. When I had thus di&s;covered what kind of Per&s;on the Countryman was, and that there was a mutual Re|&s;pect between Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> and him, I parted with an Air of Complacency, telling him that nothing &s;hould be wanting that might tend to the Gentleman's &s;peedy Recovery.</P>
<P>The next Time I call'd, which was al&s;o towards Evening, I found him engag'd, as before, with his Country Neighbour, and a grave elderly Clergyman, who I under&s;tood was his Relation; but his Ca&s;e &s;eem'd to be &s;omewhat wor&s;e, and notwith&s;tanding he had been drinking, his Spirits were very low, and he was in a great deal of De&s;pair of his Life; and there was truly a no &s;mall Concern perceivable in his Looks. When I ask'd him how he did, the Country|man, who &s;eem'd al&s;o to be in a great deal of Trou|ble, &s;hook his Head, and, without giving Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> time to an&s;wer, &s;aid, he believ'd the E&s;q; would hard|ly get over this, for he was afraid it had &s;eiz'd his Brain, and that he look'd ju&s;t as the old E&s;q; his Fa|ther did the la&s;t time he &s;aw him, which was abour a Week before he dy'd. Upon this I told the Coun|tryman he was one of <HI>Job</HI>'s Comforters, for there was no Danger of dying, unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> &s;hould give him&s;elf wholly up to Sorrow and Di&s;content. I took Notice that Fear was a natural Ingredient in the Di|&s;temper, and that it never fail'd to produce &s;uch Symp|toms
<PB N="56" REF="59">as were now ob&s;ervable in Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> and therefore that it behov'd every one, who kept him Company, to fortify him as much again&s;t it as po&s;&s;i|ble. But when I began to examine more particular|ly into the Matter, I found he had been tolerably well, until &s;uch time as his Cou&s;in the Clergyman came in, who &s;truck a &s;udden Damp upon his Mind, by telling him that the Stocks had fallen that Day above 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and therefore as &s;oon as I came to learn this, I made u&s;e of &s;everal Arguments to give a turn to his melancholy Thoughts, and to chear his Spirits, by tel|ling him that the Price of all &s;uch things were preca|rious; that they were up one Day, and down ano|ther, and that in time they might perhaps ri&s;e as high as ever, and let the wor&s;t come, they would hardly &s;ink &s;o low as &s;ome People imagin'd. I ob&s;erv'd that the Care of his Health ought to take place of all o|ther Temporal Intere&s;ts, as that was agreeable to the principal Law of Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> Self-pre&s;ervation; and, I &s;aid any one would undoubtedly be thought a Madman, who &s;hould love his Money, or any other of his Goods &s;o well, as to hurry him&s;elf out of the World for the &s;ake of them. Upon this, the Cler|gyman al&s;o made u&s;e of &s;everal grave Arguments, telling him, that a Man's Life con&s;i&s;ts not in the A|bundance of the Things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth, and that a &s;mall matter, rightly managed, would ea&s;ily &s;upport each individual in all that is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary ei|ther for Life or rational Plea&s;ure. And I found he was al&s;o going to put him in Mind wherein to place his true Happine&s;s; but the Countryman, who I ob|&s;erv'd had been drinking, and was now &s;omewhat flu&s;ter'd, broke in upon him, and interrupted him. By the Ma&s;s, &s;ays he, if that be all troubles the E&s;q; I think he's to blame; for when he has &s;old as much as will pay that new Mortgage, he'll have Five hundred a Year &s;till, to my Knowledge, and if he cannot live upon that, believe me, a Lord's Rent would be little
<PB N="57" REF="60">enough for him. But while he was going on to take a Survey of all the Manors and Farms belonging to Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> he &s;top'd him, &s;aying, Thou knowe&s;t very well, <HI>Thomas,</HI> when my Father dy'd, there was &s;ome Burden upon my E&s;tate, which I was forc'd to clear; Thou knowe&s;t likewi&s;e, that I am forc'd to pay four|&s;core Pounds a Year to my Brother <HI>Marle,</HI> who mar|ried ray Si&s;ter <HI>Betty,</HI> as the Intere&s;t of her Fortune, and the Principal mu&s;t be paid when he wants it; and I have a Wife and four Children at Home, be&s;ides my Mother's three&s;core Pounds a Year. God pre|&s;erve the good old Lady, cry'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> you'll never have the le&s;s for her, &s;he has been a good Woman in her time as I believe was in all our Country. But Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> went on and took notice, that his Hou&s;e was grown very old and chargeable in Repairs, and if he had &s;ucceeded as he thought once to have done, he intended to have built a new one. I hope, &s;ays <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> you'll take care how you &s;end your Money to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> again, but keep it on the dry Land for the time to come, and with the Grace of God, you may do well enough &s;till, as we live in a Country where all Things are both cheap and plentiful. I &s;econded what <HI>Thomas</HI> had &s;aid, and told Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> that a continued Cour&s;e of frugal Management in his Affairs at Home would be a means as likely to re|trieve his pa&s;t Lo&s;&s;es, as could be expected any other way; and tho' the Gain might not be &s;o &s;udden, yet it would be very certain, as there was &s;till a Foundation for it; be&s;ides, that a continual Employ|ment would give a good reli&s;h to his Life, and maintain a con&s;tant Series of Health, as that, would never fail to refre&s;h the Mind at all times, and keep up a perfect Sun-&s;hine and Cheerfulne&s;s, by the Succe&s;&s;ion of one ea&s;y and u&s;eful Project after ano|ther; and that he might perhaps, at la&s;t, find as much Plea&s;ure and real Satisfaction in a gradual retrieving of his Fortune, as if it had been all at once by tho&s;e new Methods he had propos'd to him&s;elf. I ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="58" REF="61">that the Mind of Man was, according to its pre&s;ent State of Exi&s;tence, incapable of very high or &s;udden Enjoyments, and that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who had the weake&s;t Minds, and the lea&s;t Ability, had common|ly the mo&s;t powerful Incentives to prompt them &s;ud|denly to &s;omething they propos'd, as an Ultimate of their Wi&s;hes, and that it often far'd with them in the End, as with the fond young Man, who was &s;o much in Love with his own Image in the Water, that he drown'd him&s;elf in endeavouring to come at it. I warrant you, &s;aid <HI>Thomas,</HI> that was before Looking-Gla&s;&s;es were in Fa&s;hion. But I went on, and ob&s;erv'd, that it was always an Argument of a great Mind to anticipate Di&s;appointments, by laying a ju&s;t weight on things, and thereby moderating its De&s;ires; and that it was a no le&s;s Token of a noble and brave Soul to fight manfully, and boldly encounter Di&s;appoint|ments when they come; but at the &s;ame time I told Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> that I did not apply what I had been &s;aying, in all its Circum&s;tances, to him, for &s;o far as I had learned into his Affairs, I could di&s;cover nothing he had aim'd at, but what was very rea&s;onable, and what any other Man in the &s;ame Condition would have done as well as he, and that I had only taken the Freedom to u&s;e tho&s;e Arguments, becau&s;e I would not have his Misfortunes prey upon him &s;o as to in|jure his Health. Upon this, he a&s;&s;ur'd me he aim'd at nothing but to clear his E&s;tate, and that he had never gone that way to work, but that &s;everal neigh|bouring Gentlemen had been in before him, and his Cou&s;in Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> had &s;ent him two Letters about it. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> &mdash; &s;aid the Countryman: Ay, marry, that's a fine &s;pun Gentleman indeed, and his fine <HI>Lon|don</HI> Lady; when he was down at the Hall la&s;t Sum|mer was three Years, he &s;aid he wondred how Gen|tlemen could drink Ale as they did; and my Lady, for|&s;ooth, would not eat ripe Plumbs that came out of one of our Wench's Hands, for fear they were not clean, but gave them to her Woman.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="62">
<P>But all this while, Mr. <HI>Pitfal's</HI> Mind run very much upon his Lo&s;&s;es. He ask'd me if I could give any Account of the Nature of the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and what was intended by it. I was not much &s;urpriz'd at this Que&s;tion, tho' it might no doubt &s;eem very odd from any one who was engag'd in it; yet his Ca&s;e was the &s;ame with many others, who had only in a blindfold Manner followed their Leaders; and it was no Wonder, that a plain country Gentleman &s;hould be thus ignorant, when &s;o many Per&s;ons about <HI>Lon|don</HI> were &s;o little acquainted with it, and &s;ome of tho&s;e, Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s too. I told him, that to dive into the Nature of that va&s;t Undertaking, &s;o as to give any tolerable In&s;ight into it, either with re&s;pect to the Advantages of it, or the manifold Hazards that might be in it, would in my Opinion require more Time and Study, than perhaps every one is aware of. But I &s;aid, he could not be ignorant of what was intended by it, <HI>viz.</HI> the Payment of the national Debts; and that in order thereunto, the <HI>South Sea</HI> Company had agreed with the Government to take in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Debts and Revenues into their capi|tal Stock, and had engaged not only to allow every Proprietor &s;uch Dividends as would in a few Years pay him his Principal, but his full Intere&s;t, propor|tionable to what had been granted by the Govern|ment for a longer Term of Years; and be&s;ides that, entitle him al&s;o to a remaining Capital, which would be very con&s;iderable. I ob&s;erv'd, that this Propo&s;al had &s;o good an A&s;pect both to the Government, as it would ea&s;e the Nation of &s;o heavy a Burden of Debt; and to all the Proprietors, who would be &s;uch con&s;i|derable Gainers by it, that all Per&s;ons, who either had Money at command, or could rai&s;e it, tho' at never &s;o great a Di&s;count, &s;trove to become Proprie|tors in it; and &s;ure, &s;aid I, the Nation was never known in any Age &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, and &s;o unani|mous for the good of Po&s;terity, as they have been in
<PB N="60" REF="63">this Affair; many Per&s;ons of con&s;iderable Rank hav|ing laid by their State, and conde&s;cended to mingle with the Crowd, to give the greater Countenance and Encouragement to it. But at this the Clergy|man took me up very &s;martly: Pray, Sir, &s;aid he, what was the Occa&s;ion of all this great Humility in tho&s;e Per&s;ons? do you believe it was from a publick Zeal, or from a View to their own private Intere&s;t, that Men of Quality expo&s;ed them&s;elves among Crowds of People, and even among the Mob, who at other times would not go one Step to do the lea&s;t Kindne&s;s to a poor indigent Per&s;on? I made An&s;wer, that it was not to be doubted, but among &s;o great a Number, there might be &s;ome who had chiefly their own Intere&s;t in View; but yet, we ought to believe, there were al&s;o many, who&s;e Views were more exten&s;ive and noble; and who had the good of others, and the Benefit of Po&s;terity mo&s;t at Heat; and I ob&s;erv'd, that this Nation was ne|ver at any Time without a Number of brave Spirits, if not &s;uperiour, at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of any other Country round about us, and that it was to be hop'd the Nation was not now &s;unk beneath what it had been in all former Ages. But the Clergyman, agreea|ble to his Function, judg'd according to the Scrip|ture Rule; I found he was a very great Enemy to all tho&s;e who &s;ought after Riches, and produced &s;everal Texts, particularly again&s;t &s;uch as ha&s;ted to be rich. He al&s;o us'd many Arguments in behalf of a true and laudable Indu&s;try, and di&s;tingui&s;hed between that kind of Diligence, which is guided by Virtue, and that which was conducted by Avarice and other vicious De|&s;ires; after which he ask'd me what Motive could prompt tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who were already remarkable for their va&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to toil and &s;truggle, and to watch every Opportunity of buying and &s;elling to the greate&s;t Advantage, as if they were the poore&s;t Crea|tures upon Earth, toiling and labouring for Bread.
<PB N="61" REF="64">I made An&s;wer, that I could not indeed commend that Practice; but I &s;aid, every Man was willing to keep his Ground, and tho&s;e who had mo&s;t, and had always bore the A&s;cendant over others, were inclina|ble to do &s;o &s;till; and that I believ'd &s;ome of tho&s;e Per&s;ons might be urg'd on, from a Su&s;picion and Jea|lou&s;y, le&s;t &s;uch, as had been all along inferior to them, &s;hould at this Juncture ri&s;e up to the &s;ame Pitch with them&s;elves; and others, who had been con&s;tantly up|on a level with them, might now al&s;o get above them. But the Clergyman in&s;i&s;ted that the&s;e were Motives neither honourable, nor any ways ju&s;tifiable; and if there was to be u&s;ed any other more favourable Pre|tence, in the behalf of &s;uch Per&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> the Support of the publick Credit, he &s;aid, it was the direct Way to de&s;troy it; he took notice that it was the Means to rai&s;e it, and give it a Name, but it was only a Mon&s;ter like the Shadow magnify'd on the Wall by the Light of a Candle, which was no ways propor|tionable to its Object.</P>
<P>He was at the &s;ame time going back to make Al|lowances for tho&s;e who were Men of Quality by Birth, but of incon&s;iderable Fortune, and likewi&s;e for &s;uch as had been rai&s;ed into &s;ome Station in the World, and had not wherewithal to &s;upport it, when the Coun|tryman broke in upon our Di&s;cour&s;e again. He had been all this while leaning forwards, with both his Hands upon the Head of his Stick, and his Face turn'd backwards to us: In this Po&s;ture he had been li&s;tening very attentively to what we were upon, but being unable to keep &s;ilent any longer, he gra&s;ped me ha&s;tily by the Arm, and &s;tretching out his Neck to|wards me, till his Mouth approached dole to mine, &s;aid he, what in the Name of Mercy do you think they would do with all that Riches and tho&s;e great E&s;tates if they had them? I was &s;en&s;ible <HI>Thomas</HI> would not be ea&s;ily put off without an An&s;wer to his Que&s;|tion; I therefore ob&s;erv'd, that the greater a Man's
<PB N="62" REF="65">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were, he had, no doubt, the more Power put into his Hands of doing Good, and as tho&s;e Per&s;ons, we had been taking notice of, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be Men of high and noble Pedigree, and as it might be expected they were virtuous and honourable, and had likewi&s;e great and excellent Examples from their own worthy Ance&s;tors; it Was therefore to be hoped they would do nothing that might bring a Stain upon their Families, to &s;ully that Lu&s;tre which had been &s;o con&s;picuous in many of their Progenitors; but if they de&s;ired a further Augmentation of their Sub&s;tances, it was only that they might be able to out&s;hine others in Acts of true Genero&s;ity. I told him there were Ways enough to be&s;tow the greate&s;t Superfluities any Man could be Ma&s;ter of; and I &s;aid, it was to be pre&s;um'd, if tho&s;e Per&s;ons had doubled their E&s;tates, as they were once in a fair way to do, ma|ny of them would have, no doubt, doubled their Bene|ficence al&s;o, and done much greater Services, not on|ly to their Country in general, and to all u&s;eful Communities of Men, but al&s;o to particular Per&s;ons. I took notice, it would be then in their Power in a more eminent Manner to &s;upport Virtue and Inno|cence wherever it was under Oppre&s;&s;ion, to rai&s;e up Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed Merit, and to depre&s;s tho&s;e, who by their Pride and In&s;olence were trouble&s;ome to their Neighbours. Ay, marry, &s;aid <HI>Thomas;</HI> but when will they do all tho&s;e fine Things you &s;peak of? and with a grinning Laugh, he ask'd if they would build any new Churches. I could not my &s;elf forbear &s;miling at this Que&s;tion; but to &s;atisfy <HI>Thomas,</HI> I made An&s;wer, that they would, no doubt, among o|ther Things a&s;&s;i&s;t in all &s;uch pious Works as the&s;e. But <HI>Thomas,</HI> as is u&s;ual to &s;uch Per&s;ons, judg'd of all Men from the few In&s;tances him&s;elf was acquainted with. Believe me, &s;aid he, if they be all like our Sir <HI>John,</HI> the Par&s;ons may preach in Barns like the Pres|byterians. There is a Man knows, pointing to Mr.
<PB N="63" REF="66"><HI>Pitfal,</HI> that our Church has been out of Repair the&s;e twenty Years at lea&s;t, and now it is in &s;o great Dan|ger of falling, that on a windy Day, I believe verily there are &s;ometimes not above &s;ix Men and Women in it be&s;ides the Par&s;on, and there are above forty Head in our Pari&s;h, who will not venture into it at all, but go to the neighbouring Pari&s;hes about. All our Gen|tlemen in the Neighbourhood, and the whole Pari&s;h, have been upon Sir <HI>John</HI> about it, to get us a Brief, becau&s;e he comes &s;o much to <HI>London</HI> among great Men. He has promis'd many time as fair as any Man can do, and &s;aid, he would give a hundred Pound towards it him&s;elf; but we cannot &s;ee a Penny of his Money, nor the Brief neither, to this Day; but if he was not much bely'd, they &s;ay he is able to build twenty Churches him&s;elf with the Money he has got out of the <HI>South Sea</HI> lately, and I am &s;ure he was rearing a Dog Kennel when I left home, tho' he comes but &s;eldom to hunt among us, that will be half as good as any Church we have near us. And as for rai|&s;ing up poor Men, as you was talking, he is &s;o far from doing that, that &s;ince he is grown &s;o rich, he'll turn a|way any Servant that will &s;uffer a poor Man or Wo|man to come about the Hou&s;e. But, &s;aid I, you know, <HI>Thomas,</HI> the old Proverb, <HI>One Swallow makes not a Sum|mer,</HI> perhaps all your great Men are not like Sir <HI>John.</HI> Ay, marry, an&s;wer'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> there is E&s;q; <HI>Bramble</HI> in the next Pari&s;h to ours came down in the beginning of Harve&s;t in a fine Coach, and &s;ix tearing Hor&s;es in it; when he went up about &s;ix Years ago, I think it may be thereabouts, as near as I can remember, his E&s;tate was not counted to be better than E&s;q; <HI>Pitfal</HI>'s, and &s;ome &s;ay it was not &s;o good; but believe me, we thought he had a mind to buy the whole County when he came down this la&s;t Time, for he bid Mo|ney for every Body's E&s;tate, and among the re&s;t, would have fain had my bit of Land, and offer'd me a very topping Price for it, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. But I thank
<PB N="64" REF="67">God I had no occa&s;ion to part with the little I had; but he was at me every Day about it, and &s;ent for me to his Hou&s;e, and was &s;o kind as never was known; he &s;aid his Steward &s;hould put my Money in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> where in two or three Months time it might be worth 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year. You'll &s;ay that was a pretty thing enough, but his Steward was a Stranger among us, and never tru&s;t me, but I think now it's as well where it is. But all this while, &s;aid I, Mr. <HI>Bramble</HI> may be a very good Man, and perhaps may do great Kindne&s;&s;es to your Country, as he is now become &s;o rich. Ay, an&s;wer'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> if he end as he has begun, I doubt we &s;hall have &s;uch doings as has not been known in our Parts. He brought down a parcel of fine dancing Fellows with white Gloves. People &s;aid they were his Footmen; but by Lady, I think they were more like Gentlemen, and turn'd a|way mo&s;t of his old Servants, except one or two that his Lady would have him keep. Some of them had liv'd there in the old E&s;q; his Father's time, and I dare &s;ay there was none of them would have wrong'd him of a Hair's breadth; but he &s;aid it was a Di&s;|grace to &s;ee &s;uch Fellows about a Gentleman's Hou&s;e; he warn'd away two of the olde&s;t Tenants on his E|&s;tate too, who&s;e Lea&s;es were almo&s;t up, to make way for a Friend of his new Steward's, who they &s;ay is to rent both Farms. I cannot tell how all things will end, but I hear he is for being off his Bargain a|gain in mo&s;t of the E&s;tates he has bought about us. I &s;aid indeed, the&s;e were In&s;tances enough of Gentle|men departing from the Foot&s;teps of their Forefa|thers, for I wanted very much that <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;hould make an end, but this Expre&s;&s;ion &s;et him on foot again. Ay, marry, an&s;wer'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> if I were to go thro' our County, I warrant I could tell you half a &s;core more. There is the Lawyer who came down with E&s;q; <HI>Bramble,</HI> and bought E&s;q; <HI>Clover</HI>'s E&s;tate, but he's but a new Comer among us, they &s;ay, has
<PB N="65" REF="68">got a Notion of Money in that <HI>South Sea;</HI> but I think he is like to do but little good with it. How &s;o, &s;aid I? How, an&s;wered <HI>Thomas,</HI> he brought a young Dam&s;el, with her wide Petticoats down with him, to be his Hou&s;e-keeper, as I under&s;tand; and when I went to him about an Affair of my Wife's Brother, who was one of E&s;q; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Tenants before this new one came among us, who &s;hould come to &s;peak to me but this Whisk? I told her I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s with her, but I wanted her Ma&s;ter; but the Flirt &s;coffed at me, and ask'd one of the fine Fellows that was in the Hall, what the Country Calf meant; but I heard her well enough, and I think I gave her her own. I told her there was no &s;uch Cattle as &s;he ever us'd to be in this Hou&s;e before. This &s;omewhat heightned my Curio&s;ity, whereupon I ask'd him if he &s;aw the new E&s;q; Ay, marry, an&s;wered <HI>Thomas;</HI> after I had waited till I was welly tir'd; I was at la&s;t brought in to his Wor&s;hip, who was &s;itting in a fine &s;ilk Robe, like a Lady, picking and &s;craping his Nails with a fine Tortoi&s;e&s;hell Knife; but how &s;trange|ly were things alter'd there from what they were in E&s;q; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Time? I came away without being &s;o muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> as ask'd to drink a Cup of &s;mall Beer, tho' I had come above &s;even Miles that Morning. I ob|&s;erv'd to him that it was not the Cu&s;tom among Gen|tlemen, who had been us'd to Bu&s;ine&s;s about <HI>London,</HI> to drink before Dinner, and that mo&s;t Men were apt to judge of other Peoples Inclinations by their own; that it might perhaps be otherwi&s;e when he came to be acquainted with the manner of the Country, and as for keeping a good neat Hou&s;e-keeper, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">aid &s;uch Things were not much thought of in our Times. By the Ma&s;s, reply'd <HI>Thomas,</HI> I think that's bad enough, tho' I could ee'n almo&s;t pardon that too, if he were good for any Thing in other Matters; but the &s;econd or third Day after he came to his new E&s;tate, he caus'd two little Cottages in the Lane, as ye go up to
<PB N="66" REF="69">the Hou&s;e, to be pulled down, which had &s;tood there, for ought I know, all E&s;q; <HI>Clover</HI>'s Time, and the poor People and their little ones have been forc'd o lie in the Barns ever &s;ince, and, as I under&s;tand, it was to plea&s;e this Wagtail, for &s;he &s;aid they and their Brats &s;tunk with Na&s;tine&s;s. I could not indeed but take Notice of that as an Act of great Cruelty; but <HI>Thomas</HI> told me, there was a Cop&s;e of Shrub upon the Brook-&s;ide on his Ground, which us'd, Time out of Mind, to be free to all the poor People thereabouts to gather Sticks to burn, and that he had given out Or|ders, if any pre&s;um'd to go there any more, he would &s;end them to the Hou&s;e of Correction. That he had al&s;o &s;top'd up the Water-Cour&s;e to a Gentleman's Mill, which ran through his Ground; and &s;aid he would oblige him to pay a new Fine, becau&s;e he found the Gentleman had omitted for two or three Years giving &s;ome &s;mall Thing to Squire <HI>Clover,</HI> that was to be paid every Year as an Acknowledgment for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many other In&s;tances, the Country|man told me concerning this Gentleman's Conduct, which were not only ungenerous, but cruel; and, if rightly look'd into, mu&s;t be al&s;o accounted fooli&s;h and imprudent; and he was going on to give us In|&s;tances of the Misbehaviour of &s;ome other Gentlemen in the &s;ame Neighbourhood; but altho' there might be &s;ome In&s;truction gather'd from all he &s;aid, yet I had not Time to hear more of them, e&s;pecially with the Circum&s;tances which are u&s;ual in his way of re|hear&s;ing them. I told him, I &s;hould be glad to be further inform'd in tho&s;e Things, when I had more Lei&s;ure; whereupon he &s;um'd up all in this general Ob&s;ervation: Verily, &s;aid he, I thought we had been like our Neighbours, but mayhap other Coun|tries may be better than ours, and may have &s;uch fine Gentlemen in them as you have been talking of; but I wot they are but thin in our Parts; unle&s;s it be
<PB N="67" REF="70">Squire <HI>Pitfal,</HI> and &s;ome other hone&s;t Gentlemen; there are but few of our great ones will &s;uffer poor Men to get any thing under them.</P>
<P>But this gave the Clergyman an Opportunity to rea&s;&s;ume his Di&s;cour&s;e. He ob&s;erv'd, that altho' Ri|ches were, next to Health, one of the greate&s;t tempo|ral Ble&s;&s;ings to all tho&s;e who knew how to u&s;e them aright; yet nothing could be &s;o great a Snare, and &s;o de&s;tructive to Per&s;ons of vicious Inclinations, as they were the proper Food and Nouri&s;hment of all their Lu&s;ts; and becau&s;e of the Power and Authori|ty which accompany'd them, he &s;aid, when they were once in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of bad Men, they were like a Sword in the Hands of a Tyrant, which cut with|out Mercy, as they enabled &s;uch the more violently to oppre&s;s others. He took notice, that many of tho&s;e who were born to great Fortunes, were often|times a Ble&s;&s;ing to their Country, as were al&s;o tho&s;e who acquir'd a moderate Sub&s;tance by their hone&s;t Indu&s;try and Labour; but, on the other hand, that &s;uch who became Ma&s;ters of very great and uncom|mon Acqui&s;itions by their boundle&s;s Avarice, were for the mo&s;t part a Plague to all who were about them, or had any Concerns with them; and that he believ'd there was no Country more than another free from &s;uch Per&s;ons, who being emulous, or rather en|vious, at the Pro&s;perity and good Fortune of others, &s;tuck at nothing to come up with them, tho' by all the cruel Methods of Oppre&s;&s;ion. He ob&s;erv'd, as the Body was nouri&s;h'd by its proper Food, &s;o a Gra|tification of our De&s;ires and Inclinations was the pro|per Food of our Minds, but with this Difference, that the Body was often &s;atisfy'd, and even &s;urfeited, but the Mind could &s;eldom have enough, e&s;pecially when it was guided by vicious Appetites; it might indeed be heated and intoxicated, but that would, like all other Drunkenne&s;s, only increa&s;e the Thir&s;t. This he ob&s;erv'd was &s;o manife&s;t, with re&s;pect to Riches,
<PB N="68" REF="71">that no one could be in&s;en&s;ible of it, after &s;o univer|&s;al an Infatuation of that kind as had happen'd late|ly among us; but what, &s;aid he, mu&s;t have been the End of all this, had every thing &s;ucceeded according to Mens vain Wi&s;hes? Any one who had been but &s;ome few Years out of his native Country, would have hardly known it upon his Return, the Face of Things would have been &s;o &s;trangely chang'd, and the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of Men pa&s;&s;ing through &s;o many Hands, would have, no doubt, caus'd as many Alterations as there were different Humours and Pa&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e Par|ties to have been gratify'd; what one would have built, another would have pull'd down, and what one had planted, another would have &s;oon rooted up; and &s;uch an infinite Number of &s;trange Projects would have been &s;et on Foot, as were never heard of before. But he took notice, that the Methods of Providence were for the mo&s;t part deliberate and &s;low, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were the mo&s;t favourable; and tho' the Wheel was indeed turn'd more about, at &s;ome particular Times, than what is ordinary, where|by many &s;trange Revolutions were accompli&s;h'd, yet &s;uch Things did not happen often, neither would we be able to bear them, if they were either to be fre|quent, or the Hurry of them was to la&s;t any Time.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Pitfal,</HI> as him&s;elf was deeplie&s;t engag'd in this Affair, and had hitherto under&s;tood but little of the Matter, was therefore willing to know &s;omething more particularly about it. He put a Stop to the Clergyman, while he was making tho&s;e general Ob|&s;ervations, and ask'd him, What he judg'd to be the Rea&s;on why the <HI>Stocks</HI> had ri&s;en &s;o high? And why, all of a &s;udden, they &s;hould fall &s;o low? To this he made An|&s;wer, That Mens Avarice had, no doubt, been the Cau&s;e of the prodigious Ri&s;e, as that extraordinary Height was with no le&s;s Probability the Occa&s;ion of the Fall. He ob&s;erv'd to him, that according to the Footing it was put upon, the Advantages to every Ad|venturer
<PB N="69" REF="72">were in a great Mea&s;ure to be proportional|ble to the Advantage of Credit; and for that Rea&s;on, as the Credit was advanc'd, the Number of Purcha|&s;ers al&s;o increas'd, which was ea&s;ily enough to be ex|pected in a Nation &s;o rich and populous as this is. The Gains that &s;ome boa&s;ted of, and that others had really made, &s;et all Per&s;ons agog after it, and &s;o &s;weet was the Pro&s;pect of getting &s;uddenly rich, that tho&s;e were look'd upon as Fools and A&s;&s;es who had the lea&s;t Diffidence in it; as on the other hand, the grea|te&s;t Blockneads were countenanc'd, who could glean up any thing to its Advantage, tho' never &s;o ab&s;urd and ridiculous. He ob&s;erv'd, that as mo&s;t Per&s;ons, who were concern'd in it, had their own private Gains chiefly in view, and thought but little of the Publick; whatever therefore they had ventur'd, was only with a De&s;ign to transfer it to &s;ome other Hand, as &s;oon as they imagin'd it come to its utmo&s;t; and as there were but few, however, forward in it, who car'd to tru&s;t it longer than while it was upon the ri|&s;ing hand, it mu&s;t have had the &s;ame Fate at whate|ver Time it came to a &s;tand; and unle&s;s the Ad|vance of Credit was no more than could bear a rea|&s;onable Balance with our real Sub&s;tance, it was im|po&s;&s;ible that it could be &s;upported, e&s;pecially, con&s;i|dering the various Humours, Intere&s;ts, and Tempers of Men, and the va&s;t Numbers concern'd in it, but mu&s;t be like a Ship at Sea, which is apt to &s;ink when &s;he is either over-burden'd with too much Sail, or oppre&s;s'd with too high and violent Winds. But be|&s;ides that evil Humour which he ob&s;erv'd to run more or le&s;s through the whole Body, he &s;aid, it was to be fear'd &s;ome of the principal Members were parti|cularly in fault, both in the exce&s;&s;ive Ri&s;e and Fall; and as the Eyes of all Per&s;ons were, no doubt, up|on tho&s;e who were mo&s;t deeply concern'd, their Example could not avoid being &s;trictly follow'd; and the Con&s;equence of this mu&s;t be to &s;ink the publick
<PB N="70" REF="73">Credit very much lower than was any ways rea|&s;onable.</P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> ask'd him, Whether he thought it would ri&s;e again? He made An&s;wer, As the Hopes of getting Riches had encourag'd People to adventure boldly, and become Proprietors even be|yond what many of them were able; &s;o, after &s;o great a Damp, the Fear of lo&s;ing, as that was of e|qual, if not &s;uperiour Importance on the Mind, would, no doubt, hinder many for &s;ome Time from becom|ing Purcha&s;ers; but yet as there was perhaps no ju&s;t Rea&s;on for its &s;inking &s;o low; and as there was &s;uch a va&s;t Number of Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e of all Ranks, immediately concern'd in it, and as the whole Na|tion was now in a manner link'd into it, it was not therefore improbable, but &s;uch prudent Mea&s;ures would be taken, as would not only in time rai&s;e it to a moderate Height, but al&s;o &s;upport it; and it was likewi&s;e to be hop'd, that tho&s;e who had hitherto on|ly an Eye to their own private Intere&s;t, would hence|forward believe, as they were all Members of the &s;ame Body, that nothing would in the End turn &s;o much to their real Account, as con&s;ulting the Inte|re&s;t of other Per&s;ons, as well as their own.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pitfal</HI> began now to be more chearful, and his country Neighbour was no le&s;s encourag'd to &s;ee him &s;o; he jog'd him on the Arm, and drank to his good Succe&s;s, telling him, That he hop'd to &s;ee <HI>Maple-Hall</HI> new built in a &s;horter Time than he thought for; and after the Gla&s;s had gone round, and that I was go|ing to take my Leave of him, I de&s;ir'd him to be of good Courage, to wait with Patience, and not to be troubled or anxious about his Intere&s;t in the Publick; &s;ince, as the Gentleman had ob&s;erv'd, the able&s;t and greate&s;t Men in the Nation were concern'd in it as well as he, and that therefore there would be &s;uffi|cient Care taken of it; and as he was to go &s;hortly into the Country, I put him in Remembrance of the
<PB N="71" REF="74">Advice I had already given him, to keep him&s;elf al|ways employ'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome u&s;eful Bu&s;ine&s;s or another, and, at proper times, &s;aid he might al&s;o drink a Gla&s;s, in Moderation, with his Friends, which would not only be the likelie&s;t Means to recover him, but al&s;o to pre&s;erve him in a perfect State of Health, as the Intervals of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Company would keep off all melancholy Reflexions.</P>
