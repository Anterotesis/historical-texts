<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE miliary Fever, either in its &s;imple or compound State, is the mo&s;t frequent Di&s;ea&s;e that happens to Men, Wo|men, and Children, of all Degrees, and almo&s;t all Ages, throughout all Sea&s;ons of the Year; in Child-bed Women 'tis rare to meet with any other Fever of Con&s;equence: Notwith&s;tanding hitherto it has been le&s;s taken Notice of by Authors in general, is le&s;s known by the Phy|&s;icians and Apothecaries, and its
<PB N="iv" REF="4"><HI>right</HI> Method of Cure le&s;s under|&s;tood, than any other <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;tem|per that afflicts Mankind.</P>
<P>How to account for this general, but unpardonable Ignorance, I am much at a Lo&s;s, except the pre|vailing Opinion of &s;ome Phy&s;icians, <HI>That this Fever is a Creature of our own making, and that the Eruption is brought forth by the U&s;e of too hot Medicines;</HI> I &s;ay, except that pre|vailing Opinion has run through the whole <HI>College,</HI> and from thence the dangerous Infection been conveyed to the Apothecaries; of whom the greate&s;t Part are indeed &s;o very in|con&s;iderate and negligent, and &s;o little inqui&s;itive into the <HI>Nature</HI> of Di&s;tempers, that they mu&s;t of Con|&s;equence be great Strangers to <HI>Ob|&s;ervation</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="5">and <HI>Experience,</HI> the mo&s;t faithful Guides to a <HI>right</HI> Practice of Phy&s;ic. I would not romance, or &s;peak with Malice, but can a&s;&s;ert with great Confidence, that I have had an Opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing with &s;ome Phy&s;icians, and many Apothecaries, concerning the <HI>Na|ture</HI> and <HI>Treatment</HI> of this Di&s;tem|per; but, good God, how great their Ignorance, how unaccountable their Stupidity and Ob&s;tinacy! I can hardly forbear blu&s;hing when I think of it, and yet all the A&s;&s;u|rance I could give them of my Suc|ce&s;s, by Word of Mouth, had no Effect, they &s;till re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;t|ing in their de&s;tructive Treatment, tho' half of their Patients fell under their Hands; till I had an Oppor|tunity of convincing them by ocu|lar
<PB N="vi" REF="6">Demon&s;tration, with how much Safety, Ea&s;e, and Expedition, I cur'd tho&s;e who were under my own Care; and almo&s;t with as much Certainty as Intermittents by the Bark; not more than one in twenty dying, except I have been called in at the la&s;t Stage of the Di&s;temper, when I found their <HI>Mittimus</HI> al|ready &s;igned. During &s;everal of my younger Years, I had an Opportu|nity of attending one of the&s;e Gen|tlemen, very eminent in his Profe&s;|&s;ion, and in great Practice; but, all the Time I was with him, I only once heard mention'd the Words <HI>miliary Fever,</HI> and tho&s;e in &s;o &s;light a Manner, as not &s;ufficiently to at|tract my Attention; but knew no|thing of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Di&s;tem|per, or the <HI>miliary Eruption,</HI> hav|ing
<PB N="vii" REF="7">not &s;een one Patient, who, it was &s;aid, had them, altho' this Gen|tleman had been in the Profe&s;&s;ion <HI>Twenty Years;</HI></P>

<P>And that it is a Fever <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> and altogether as different from o|ther Fevers, as the Mea&s;les from the Small-Pox, is with me out of Di&s;|pute; and that it exi&s;ted, long be|fore my Time, is &s;ufficiently re|corded by the Te&s;timonies of Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> and Sir <HI>David Hamilton;</HI> the la&s;t of whom Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> mentions with great Reve|rence and Re&s;pect
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">And here I am obliged, by many Ties, to do Ju&s;tice to that very worthy and skilful Gentleman, Sir <HI>David Hamilton,</HI> Phy&s;ician, lately decea&s;ed, who in our conjunct Attendance on a Per&s;on of Quality in this la&s;t Di&s;temper (the miliary Fever) did, to my great Satisfaction, &s;o readily foretel every &s;ucceeding Change, and &s;o aptly furni&s;h out a Remedy for every Accident, as did abundantly &s;hew it familiar to him, and ju&s;tify the Hi&s;tory and Method of Cure publi&s;hed by him, of this tedious and dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e, the miliary Fever. A Di&s;ea&s;e, tho' le&s;s common,
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">This is a Mi&s;take of the Doctor's, through Want of Ob&s;ervation.</NOTE> yet as various and as nice, and much more tedious than the Small-Pox it&s;elf. <HI>Cheyne.</HI></NOTE></P>
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
<P>That the Eruption is caus'd by the U&s;e of too hot Medicines and Regimen, I ab&s;olutely deny, altho' &s;uch Method, I know, will prolong the Cure, if it does not &s;oon kill the Patient; for I have often attended poor Men, Women, and Children, who have &s;carcely had Cloaths to cover them, and have taken no Me|dicines, but drank cold Water, or
<PB N="ix" REF="9">Small-Beer, four or five Days or lon|ger, before I have been call'd to them, and yet this Fever, according to the be&s;t Account I could collect, has gone thro' its various Symp|toms, but <HI>in a terrible Manner, even to a very plentiful Eruption of the cry&s;talline</HI> Pu&s;tles; but, by the U&s;e of <HI>too cold a Regimen,</HI> then almo&s;t ready to expire for Want of other A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;uch as <HI>cordial</HI> and <HI>diaphoretic</HI> Medicines, to con|duct them &s;afely thro' the la&s;t Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which was by &s;uch Means very &s;oon and &s;urpri&s;ingly effected.</P>
<P>In the Year 1741, this Fever in its wor&s;t Degree was more epidemi|cal than ever I have found it with|in my Time, and &s;wept away great
<PB N="x" REF="10">Numbers of People of all Degrees and Ages under Fifty, (for few a|bove that Age were then &s;eiz'd with it,) in&s;omuch that the Bills of Mor|tality amounted weekly to twelve or fifteen Hundred, for a con&s;ider|able Time: In the Beginning of this Con&s;titution, Patients were treated, by other Practi&s;ers as well as my&s;elf, with Bleeding and Vo|miting indi&s;criminately, Bli&s;tering early and without Mercy, <HI>Sal Nitri,</HI> or Saline Draughts, with or with|out <HI>Sal. Vol. C. C.</HI> which were con|tinu'd four or five Days without <HI>real</HI> Advantage, and were then changed for <HI>Conf. Raleigh,</HI> which, doing no more Service than the for|mer, was again chang'd in three or four Days more for <HI>Sal. C. C. Pulv. Serp. &amp;c.</HI> which then brought on
<PB N="xi" REF="11"><HI>Delirium</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;ultus Tendinum,</HI> Symptoms which introduc'd a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Bli&s;tering Plai&s;ters from Head to Foot, which were not like|ly to relieve the Patient in any De|gree, &s;o long as the Cau&s;es of all this Mi&s;chief, <HI>too hot Medicines,</HI> were daily repeated, till the Scene clos'd in Death; but which did not frequently happen till the 15th, 20th, or &s;ometimes the 25th Day; with this Satisfaction only to their &s;urviving Relations and Friends, <HI>that they had,</HI> as they thought, <HI>done all that could be done for the Deceas'd;</HI> altho', to &s;peak the Truth, they could not take a more effectual Me|thod to remove them out of the World. This &s;hocking Succe&s;s, which made me almo&s;t weary of my Profe&s;&s;ion, as I could not avoid
<PB N="xii" REF="12">thinking, that we all treated this Fever after a wrong Manner, obli|ged me often to think &s;eriou&s;ly up|on the Matter, and examine many of the be&s;t Authors, who had wrote of Fevers; I could find nothing in them that &s;uited my Purpo&s;e, and but very few that even mention'd &s;uch a Fever; till, dipping into <HI>Allen</HI>'s <HI>Synop&s;is,</HI> I found that Sir <HI>David Hamilton</HI>'s Treati&s;e upon that Subject was my chief Depen|dance
<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">I did not know that Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> had wrote upon that Subject, till very lately I accidentally read his Di&s;cour&s;e of the Plague, wherein I found a previous Account of the miliary Fever.</NOTE> This I procur'd, and, after reading it over and over again with great Attention, determin'd to follow the &s;ame Method in that Ca&s;e, with all the Patients who &s;hould
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">happen afterwards to fall under my <HI>&s;ole</HI> Management; as I religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd the <HI>&s;peculative,</HI> as well as the <HI>practical</HI> Part, &s;o did I ever af|ter as happily conduct my Patients thro' every Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e; for, as before, not more than five out of ten liv'd, &s;o now <HI>not one in ten died,</HI> and tho&s;e only who had &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e in Conjunction with this Fever; with this Inconvenience only, that the Cure, tho' almo&s;t certain, was very tedious, even 20, 25, or 30 Days. But happy was I, that I had met with even a tedious Cure; nothing now remain'd for me to do, but farther to con&s;ider if it was not practicable to contract the Cure within a &s;horter Compa&s;s, by more powerful Medicines, and yet &s;uch as would by no Means ag|gravate
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">the Symptoms. Whil&s;t I was thus pondering, I recollected that my Author ob&s;erv'd, as a favourable Progno&s;tic, <HI>that the drowsier Pati|ents are, the happier they recover</HI>
<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><Q>A Phy&s;ician may as certainly take the cura|tive Indications from the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tances of the Di&s;ea&s;e, as he does the Diagno&s;tic from them. <BIBL>SYDENHAM.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>
. Rea&s;oning with my&s;elf upon this Principle, I luckily hit upon a &s;peedier Method, which from Time to Time, with the greate&s;t Care and Attention, I alter'd, till I had re|duc'd the Cure of this devouring Fever to as great Certainty, as al|mo&s;t any we can boa&s;t of in the Practice of Phy&s;ic: Thus I fix'd the Rule of my Practice for the fu|ture, and which I have continu'd from that Time to this, with &s;o
<PB N="xv" REF="15">much Succe&s;s, that, for &s;even Years pa&s;t, I confidently affirm, I have not lo&s;t above <HI>four Patients out of a Hundred,</HI> of that Fever in its &s;imple State; nay furthermore, for one Patient that I have had under my Care fifteen Days, ten have per|fectly recover'd in two Thirds of the Time, and, even in many, all dangerous Symptoms have been ab|&s;olutely remov'd before the Erup|tion appear'd; which, altho' it may &s;eem &s;trange to mo&s;t of our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, is neverthele&s;s no more &s;trange than true, as they them|&s;elves may prove, if they diligently ob&s;erve the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and exactly follow the Method of Cure, as I have done before them.</P>
<PB N="xvi" REF="16">
<P>For the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I have ab&s;tracted from Sir <HI>David Hamilton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> all that I judge nece&s;&s;ary in Relation to the De&s;cription and Nature of this Fe|ver; to which I have added occa|&s;ional Remarks, and my own Me|thod of Cure, which by repeated Trials, and diligent Ob&s;ervation, I have prov'd to be more ea&s;y, &s;peedy, and &s;afe, than even theirs, or any other, that I know of; if any Body &s;hall hereafter publi&s;h a better, I &s;hall receive the &s;ame with as much Satisfaction as I communicate mine, having nothing more at Heart than the Service of my Profe&s;&s;ion, and the U&s;e of all po&s;&s;ible Means for the public Welfare.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Have cho&s;en to de&s;cribe, before all other Di&s;ea&s;es, the Nature and Method of curing a <HI>Miliary Fever;</HI> becau&s;e I know of none who have hitherto treated of this Fever, as of a different Sort, at lea&s;t, in any &s;atisfactory Way; when, notwith&s;tanding, I have known it, in &s;everal, to turn either into a chronical Di&s;temper, or in a &s;hort Time to prove fatal. For this &s;ometimes comes to pa&s;s, in a mild Beginning of this Di&s;temper, from a Neglect of them&s;elves, or thro' an Impatience of the Sick at its long Continuance; and &s;ometimes
<PB N="xxii" REF="20">al&s;o from the <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the Phy&s;i|cians, being deluded with its fallaci|ous Symptoms; or, la&s;tly, thro' an un|rea&s;onable Fear
<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The Patient will be in no Danger, on that Account, now; for that Sort of Fear has been long &s;ince bani&s;hed.</NOTE> of being thought greedy of Gain, they omit conti|nuing their nece&s;&s;ary Vi&s;its. Where|fore, I have thought it a Work wor|thy of my Time, if by the&s;e my Ob&s;ervations, being diligently col|lected from the daily In&s;pection, or Attendance upon &s;ick Per&s;ons, I might afford &s;ome Light to young Practitioners; and by the&s;e Means &s;tir up the more &s;kilful to pub|li&s;h their own; and the Reader may a&s;&s;uredly believe, that I have acted with great Veracity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="tract">
<PB REF="21">
<HEAD>OF THE MILIARY FEVER.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Name, Kind, and Sorts of this Di&s;temper.</HEAD>
<P>A Miliary Fever take its Name from the Pu&s;tles, or Ve&s;icles, in &s;ome Sort re&s;embling the Form of Gromwel Seeds, appearing chiefly about the upper Parts; yet I think it ought ra|ther to be called a ve&s;icular Fever, becau&s;e the Pu&s;tles are Ve&s;icles, or little Bli&s;ters, filled at fir&s;t with a limpid Serum, and afterwards with a whiti&s;h, not unlike to the Colour of Pearls.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<P>There are &s;ome who think, that only the pe&s;tilential and &s;potted Fevers ought to be reckoned among&s;t the malign Kind; but I am of Opinion, that there are like|wi&s;e others of a different Species, which may very well be referred to the malign Cla&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. What Kind of Fevers &s;oever, which are acquired by Contact, or Breathing <HI>(Vapour)</HI> or any other Manner of In|fection.</P>
<P N="2">2. Al&s;o tho&s;e Sorts of Fevers, which, immediately from the Beginning, are ac|companied with a violent Pain, and fix'd to &s;ome Part; as to the Head, or Region of the Guts, or Kidneys, or even to the Limbs: Like as if the Patient &s;hould be affected with a Pain of the Head, or a Cholic, or a nephritic, or a gouty, or a rheu|matic Pain; or even with the Pains (like tho&s;e) of Child-birth, as if the &s;ame was an original Di&s;temper; when, notwith|&s;tanding,
<PB N="25" REF="23">&s;uch Sort are the Symptoms of a miliary Fever; they will not give Way to Remedies which are wont to be of Service, when the Di&s;ea&s;es &s;o nam'd are primary.</P>
<P N="3">3. Al&s;o in whom the animal Spirits are &s;uddenly oppre&s;s'd and eclips'd; and where the afore&s;aid Symptoms &s;eem to depend on no evident Cau&s;e, but on a certain la|tent Poi&s;on, call'd, by the Antients, an oc|cult Quality, and by the Moderns, Va|pours.</P>
<P>Or, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> where &s;udden Death ari&s;es from a Cau&s;e which &s;eems to be void of Danger; all which, as they denote a Ma|lignity, &s;o al&s;o have I ob&s;erved the &s;ame to happen in a miliary Fever.</P>
<P>And it is worthy of Remark, that this Fever rages with the &s;ame Malignity, as the petechial or &s;potted Fever in the <HI>In|dies.</HI></P>
<PB N="26" REF="24">
<P>This Kind of Fever is two-fold, &s;imple and compound. I call it &s;imple, as often as no Pu&s;tles be&s;ides the miliary appear, whereof I am going to di&s;cour&s;e; but com|pound, when red, papillary Pu&s;tules are inter&s;pers'd with the miliary, and which, when they are &s;olitary, are commonly cal|led a Ra&s;h. And it is farther to be ob&s;erv'd that miliary Pu&s;tules are &s;ometimes in|termix'd with the Small-Pox, and, while the Small-Pox ri&s;es up, tho&s;e gradually wither away; but remain &s;tanding, after the papillary are dried up.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the Miliary Fever.</HEAD>
<P>That I may the better de&s;cribe the Hi|&s;tory of a miliary Fever, I &s;hall reckon up the Antecedents, Concomitants, and Con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>The Antecedents are, a weak Con&s;ti|tution of Body, whether the &s;ame be na|tural
<PB N="27" REF="25">or adventitious, caus'd by immode|rate Evacuations, or too &s;pare Diet; a &s;e|rous or wat'ry Blood; a weak and timo|rous Mind, and ea&s;ily annoy'd by external Accidents, as in Women and effeminate Men; much and deep Study (or Thought-fulne&s;s) or Sorrow; an Ob&s;truction, or Ulcer in any Part, attended with Pain: Whence tho&s;e Per&s;ons who have been long afflicted with a Cholic Pain, Gout, or Stone, or an Ulcer of the Kidneys, are more ob|noxious to this Fever. Al&s;o an inward Heat in Women, with or without Thir&s;t, and e&s;pecially about the Time of their Deli|very, whereby al&s;o the Pains of Child-bear|ing are le&s;s &s;evere than u&s;ual, and the Spirits, without any evident Cau&s;e, are very much depre&s;s'd, with an Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, cau&s;ing Sighs; wherein, as in all other Fe|vers, here al&s;o generally happens an exter|nal Coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Concomitants, or Symptoms ac|companying this Fever, are oftentimes a Pain re&s;embling that of the Cholic, Stone
<PB N="28" REF="26">of the Kidneys, Pleuri&s;y, Rheumati&s;m, or that of Child-birth; likewi&s;e an Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, with a Sinking of the Spirits: And, two or three Days after the &s;aid Pain is gone off, there comes on a Shivering of the whole Body, and then a Coldne&s;s and an Heat alternately ari&s;e. Yet this Heat is milder than in a common continual Fever, and comes nearer to that of natural; the Palms of the Hands are affected with a more inten&s;e Heat, while the Back-part is much cooler; the Pul&s;e al&s;o is frequent, but weak; the Spirits often flag very much; and the Brea&s;t, being oppre&s;&s;ed as it were with a great Weight, cau&s;eth Sighings; the Sleep &s;tealing on is &s;uddenly interrup|ted, the mo&s;t in&s;eparable Token of all the Symptoms; for the Patients are often with|out Sleep for many Days and Nights to|gether
<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">This Symptom will &s;carcely, or ever, be met with, if the Fever be treated in the Manner, as here|after directed.</NOTE> without a Delirium, or a Pain of the Head, and generally much longer than in other Fevers. I met with a very
<PB N="29" REF="27">&s;ingular Example of this Ca&s;e, in a certain Lady who was under the Care of the learned Dr. <HI>Bernard.</HI> She was a whole Month in this Fever, without Sleep; yet free of a Delirium, or any Pain in the Head.</P>
<P>The Tongue is &s;ometimes cover'd over with white <HI>Aphthoe,</HI> or a Thru&s;h, and &s;ome|times like that of Per&s;ons in Health; the Urine is one while as pale as common Wa|ter, at others, of a natural Colour: Which Symptoms, deceiving young Phy&s;icians, make them frequently attribute this Effect to the Vapours, as they term it. They who are &s;eized with this Fever, are &s;ome times afflicted with a Sickne&s;s at Stomach, e&s;pecially after Sleep; and &s;ometimes with a Sorene&s;s, either by their own Negligence, or <HI>a bad</HI> Practice; to wit, while <HI>heating Medicines,</HI> u&s;ual in hy&s;teric Paroxy&s;ms, are pre&s;crib'd, <HI>without Diaphoretics;</HI> whence in Lieu of a mild Procedure of Nature, ex|pelling the morbific Matter by a <HI>gentle Sweating,</HI> a rapid Fermentation throws down the &s;ame into the Guts. The Belly
<PB N="30" REF="28">is &s;ometimes bound, and sometimes loose, with a Sickne&s;s at the Stomach, and Pains of the Bowels; one while they are thir&s;ty, at others, very little; &s;ometimes the Hands and Tongue, being &s;tretched out to the Phy&s;ician, tremble, and the Patient &s;peaks in a trembling Manner; they are al&s;o often mole&s;ted with convul&s;ive Motions, a Deli|rium, and a difficult Re&s;piration; the Exa|cerbations of which Symptoms return like the Paroxy&s;ms of an intermitting Fever. An Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t with Sighing, or a greater Sinking of the Spirits, without manife&s;t Cau&s;e; Watchings, and a Com|motion of the Spirits, commonly called a Hurry in the Head, as often as the Sick compo&s;e them&s;elves to Sleep; as likewi&s;e a frequent and weak Pul&s;e, being conjoin'd with certain other Symptoms, are always the Fore-runners of the miliary Pu&s;tles at Hand: And they are all wont to continue till the miliary Pu&s;tles break out, and then the Patients are freed from mo&s;t of them.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="29">
<P>The&s;e Pu&s;tles generally appear in the Brea&s;t, Neck, and Inter&s;tices of the Fin|gers, &s;ometimes al&s;o in the whole Body; and, after a daily and gradual Increa&s;e, they at la&s;t vani&s;h away, leaving the Skin rough in the Seats of the Pu&s;tles. They &s;ome|times itch, e&s;pecially in a complex miliary Fever; that is, where red papillary Pu&s;tles are mix'd with the miliary. And it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that, by how much &s;impler this Fever is, by &s;o much &s;lighter are the Symptoms, and which for this very Rea|&s;on frequently creates a Neglect, both in the unwary Phy&s;icians, and in the Patients; whereby this Fever either becomes more perilous, or another Di&s;ea&s;e often ari&s;es; for, by taking le&s;s Care at fir&s;t than ought to have been u&s;ed, it &s;ometimes begins with more grievous Symptoms; as, with a Sickne&s;s of the Stomach, Lo&s;s of Appetite, an inward Heat, an Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, Sinking of the Spirits, Sighing and irregu|lar Returns of Heat and Cold, Watchings, and the like. In the Declination of this
<PB N="32" REF="30">Fever, the upper Part of the Hands are often moi&s;ten'd with a cold Sweat.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to ob&s;erve, whether the miliary Pu&s;tles are wont to appear on a certain Day; &s;eeing the fir&s;t Appearance of this Di&s;temper, and the Patient's Ac|count of the &s;ame, are &s;o uncertain. But, as far as I can learn, I take them mo&s;tly to appear about the Tenth or Eleventh Day from the Beginning, if &s;o be the Fever have a regular Progre&s;s, and are dried up about the Eighteenth; or, where there is Plenty of morbific Matter, about the Twen|ty-fir&s;t or Twenty-&s;econd Day.</P>
<P>I have chiefly endeavour'd to ob&s;erve the Time of the Eruption in tho&s;e Women, to whom I have been call'd, on the Third Day after their Delivery; and have heard them complaining of a Shivering or Cold|ne&s;s, follow'd with an Heat: For when I found, in looking upon their Brea&s;t and Neck, the miliary Pu&s;tles there, I conclud|ed, that they had been &s;eiz'd many Days
<PB N="33" REF="31">before with a miliary Fever; and, upon a &s;trict Scrutiny made even from the Begin|ning of the Di&s;temper, I under&s;tood that they had perceiv'd either a preternatural Heat, or a Pain of &s;ome Part, with or with|out Thir&s;t, and a vehement Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, with Sighings, and a Sinking of the Spirits before they were brought to-bed; which Symptoms being &s;uppos'd to depend on the approaching Birth, they hop'd all wou'd be well, when it was over. More|over, altho' they have the Pains of Child|birth milder than u&s;ual, yet the great Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t in &s;uch, with the Sighing and Deficiency of Spirits (called by the Midwives Fear and Vapours) and the quick and weak Pul&s;e are &s;ure Prog|no&s;tic&s; of the approaching miliary Pu&s;tles; to who&s;e Eruption in Child-bed Women, a Way is made by their compo&s;ing in Bed to &s;weat: Therefore I commonly reckon ele|ven Days from the fir&s;t inward Heat, or Pain before the Birth, to the Eruption after the Birth. But the Ignorance, and pre|po&s;terous Relation the Patients give of their
<PB N="34" REF="32">own State, do, for the mo&s;t Part, &s;o con|found the Phy&s;ician's Progno&s;tic, that even the mo&s;t curious can't find out the very Day.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equences of a miliary Fever, as far as my Ob&s;ervation reacheth, are a Swel|ling of the Thighs, Legs, and Feet, not al|ways free from Pain; a Swelling and Ab|&s;ce&s;s of the Brea&s;ts; an immoderate Flux of the <HI>Lochia,</HI> and of Urine; Hypocon|driac or Hy&s;teric-like Affects; an inward Heat join'd with a Weakne&s;s, Faintne&s;s; and Lo&s;s of Appetite: One or other of the&s;e, I &s;ay, are generally the Con&s;equen|ces, as often as this Fever, either by Rea|&s;on of its own Ill-nature, or <HI>bad Treatment of the Phy&s;ician,</HI> makes an unhappy End|ing
<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The Symptoms of the miliary Fever, in the Year 1741, were the&s;e; Shivering or Coldne&s;s, and Heat alternately; a Pain of the Head, Limbs; Back, like the Stone in the Kidneys; Belly, like the Cholic; Sickne&s;s, bilious Vomiting, Loo&s;ene&s;s; Sinking of the Spirits, Oppre&s;&s;ion at the Brea&s;t; a moi&s;t Tongue, little Thir&s;t; the Urine of an Amber Colour, like that of a Per&s;on in Health; a &s;trong, full, quick Pul&s;e at the Beginning, but three or four Days after|wards, weak, low, and &s;wift; Delirium, <HI>Sub&s;ultus Tendinum,</HI> difficult Re&s;piration; the Heat milder than in other continual Fevers.
<P>The Appearance of the Eruption, which was chief|ly of the cry&s;talline Kind, did not happen till the 14th, 15th, or 16th Days; which, I have now Rea|&s;on to believe, would have appear'd &s;ooner, if it had not been retarded, by the bad Conduct of the Patient or Nur&s;e, or imprudent Treatment of the Phy&s;ician.</P></NOTE>

<PB REF="38">
<HEAD>OF THE MILIARY FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE miliary Fever, &s;o called from the &s;mall red Eruptions that re|&s;emble Millet-&s;eed, is the mo&s;t frequent in this Country of all the malignant Kind.</P>
<P>The Patient often &s;eems to him&s;elf at fir&s;t only &s;omewhat faint and indi&s;pos'd, his Strength and Appetite dimini&s;hed, and his Sleep interrupted, and his Dreams di&s;orderly and tumultuous, while he goes abroad and applies to his u&s;ual Bu&s;ine&s;s, and hopes his Indi&s;po&s;ition will &s;oon wear off, not &s;u&s;pecting that he nouri&s;hes a malignant Fever in his Bo&s;om. At length after about &s;even or eight Days, when he
<PB N="42" REF="39">has taken to his Bed, by Means of copious and profu&s;e Sweats, the miliary Eruptions before mention'd appear in the Temples, the Neck and Brea&s;t, and &s;ometimes &s;pread over the whole Body. If the Quantity be not great, as in the di&s;tinct Kind of the Small-Pox, they generally pre&s;age a happy Event; but if they are very numerous, and cover the whole Surface of the Skin, then, like the Small-Pox of the confluent Kind, they are often fatal, and always dangerous; and they are in this too like that Sort of Small-Pox, that, as I have &s;een, in their Ripening, they &s;ometimes flow or run in|to each other
<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">There are, notwith&s;tanding, Phy&s;icians, who, to this Day, ignorantly pre&s;age the happie&s;t Event, from the greate&s;t Quantity of Pu&s;tles; of which I have often been an Ear-witne&s;s.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e little red Eruptions grow by De|grees to Maturity, acquire white Heads full of Matter, and then grow dry, and die away; which Cour&s;e, in the more kindly Sort, is generally accompli&s;h'd in &s;even
<PB N="43" REF="40">Days; but, in the wor&s;t Sort, the Time is much farther protracted, and this happens al&s;o in the wor&s;t Sort of Small-Pox; and it is very remarkable, that it &s;ometimes falls out, that in this Sort of Fevers, after one Eruption of a more malignant Kind has compleated its Cour&s;e, and the Skin is clear'd of its putrid Crop, yet a &s;wift, trou|bled Pul&s;e, great Drought and Want of Spi|rits, &s;hall continue, and the Phy&s;ician may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that either Death, or another Erup|tion
<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">(i) A &s;econd Fever and Eruption, I likewi&s;e know, often &s;ucceed the fir&s;t, but that is only when the Pa|tient has been ill-treated, or when the Continuance of proper Medicines, for a &s;ufficient Time, has been ob&s;tinately refus'd.</NOTE> like the fir&s;t is at Hand, to carry off the Matter of the Fever, which the fir&s;t was unable wholly to perform: And this I have &s;een repeated the third Time, and even after that the Patient has recover'd, which but rarely happens.</P>
<P>The great and profu&s;e Sweats, that pre|cede the miliary Eruption, are by no Means
<PB N="44" REF="41">&s;uch as critically di&s;charge the Putrefaction that cau&s;es the Di&s;ea&s;e; but they ari&s;e from the violent Conflict and Agitation of the Blood, while the &s;ound and active Parts exert their Force, to dige&s;t and expel the Matter of the Di&s;ea&s;e; and therefore they do not re|lieve oppre&s;s'd Nature, but &s;ink and weaken the Spirits by an exce&s;&s;ive Evacuation
<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">This brings to my Mind the Ca&s;e of a Female Patient, who, at my fir&s;t Vi&s;it, I found drowning, if I may &s;o &s;ay, in tho&s;e Sweats; with an interrupted Pul&s;e, and the Feet and Hands growing cold; at which, I pre&s;ag'd Death in a &s;hort Time. The Apo|thecary, being told, upon Enquiry, my Opinion, &s;aid, He cou'd not &s;ee any Thing which had that Appear|ance, for that &s;he was in a <HI>fine breathing Sweat,</HI> and a mo&s;t <HI>&s;weet Sleep;</HI> but, <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>&s;weet</HI> as they were, &s;he died in twenty-four Hours afterwards.</NOTE>
; which however is nece&s;&s;ary, that the putrid Parts may be excluded from the Blood by the miliary Eruptions that follow, in which con&s;i&s;ts the critical Separation by which Nature is deliver'd, and the Blood recovers its healthful State; as it does by ca&s;ting out the Matter of the Small-Pox, at fir&s;t complicated and entangled with the Ma&s;s of Blood.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="42">
<P>Some Phy&s;icians, too fond of the <HI>cool Method</HI> in the Management of Fevers, from their Ob&s;ervation of the U&s;efulne&s;s of that Conduct in inflammatory Di&s;tempers, &s;uch as the Small-Pox, Rheumati&s;ms, Pleuri|&s;ies, Quin&s;ies, and St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Fire; have injudiciou&s;ly extended it to the Cure of malignant Ca&s;es, in which a con&s;iderable Quantity of the Blood is putrefied or pe|ri&s;h'd by the Di&s;&s;olution or Separation of the Parts, as before de&s;crib'd; but they &s;eem not to act under the Guidance of Rea&s;on, but, in a mechanical Way of Practice, ap|ply the &s;ame Method of Cure to all Sorts of Fevers, tho' their Nature be ever &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;h'd. And hence it is, that the&s;e Gentlemen will not allow, that the miliary Eruptions are a regular Di&s;charge of the Feveri&s;h Matter from the Blood; but, &s;ay they, they are the Effect of an un&s;kilful Conduct, in u&s;ing Remedies of too hot a Nature, by which the Blood is put into too great a Hurry and Agitation : But this A&s;&s;ertion affronts all Rea&s;on and Ob&s;ervation.
<PB N="46" REF="43">They may as well affirm, that the Small-Pox, Mea&s;les, and Scarlet Suffu&s;ions, Boils, and Blanes, wou'd never appear on the Skin, were they not produc'd and exclud|ed by the Admini&s;tration of too warm and active Remedies. I have often &s;een tho&s;e Eruptions break out in great Abundance, where the cool Method has been exactly ob&s;erv'd; and of this every Practi&s;er may be &s;oon convinc'd, if he carefully attends to the Growth and Progre&s;s of this Di&s;tem|per. In this, as in the Di&s;ea&s;es above-nam'd, the hurtful Matter, admitted into the Blood, is by Nature's Determination to be fir&s;t concocted, and then &s;eparated by the Strainers of the Skin, where being en|tangled, and not &s;uffered to per&s;pire, it produces a miliary Harve&s;t; and a Phy|&s;ician, being but a <HI>Servant of Nature,</HI> ought to follow her Steps, promote her Inten|tions, and not to turn her from her Path, and oppo&s;e her Operations
<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">When the oppo&s;ite Practice is made u&s;e of, by Mi&s;take, it is manife&s;tly preductive of great Evils; as when, for Example, the miliary Fever is taken for an Intermittent; &s;aline Draughts, &s;ucceeded by the Bark, are then not only confidently pre&s;crib'd, but the Practi&s;er without He&s;itation declares the Danger entirely over, not knowing that he is at once giving a fatal Stab to his own Reputation, and his Patient's Life; for Death mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, and to the Surprize of the Doctor, as well as all about the poor Sufferer, mu&s;t &s;oon clo&s;e the Tragedy.
<P>As when, likewi&s;e, that Fever is taken for a Cho|lic, the Stone in the Kidneys, or the Rheumati&s;m, the &s;ame fatal I&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence; with this Difference only, that, in the&s;e latter Ca&s;es Death makes his Approach, more &s;low, but more terrible; for it is then not uncommon for an Ab&s;ce&s;s to be form'd in the Brea&s;t or Belly, or other lingering Di&s;orders to follow, which, together with an hectic Fever, at length, fini&s;h Life.</P>
<P>Some eminent and worthy Phy&s;icians, of my Ac|quaintance, know what I &s;ay to be true, becau&s;e they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible how much they have &s;uffer'd in their Reputations, by the&s;e fatal Mi&s;takes; particularly, by the Mal-admini&s;tration of their <HI>ador'd Cortex.</HI></P>
<P>I could relate many Hi&s;tories of the&s;e tragical Events, but I think the&s;e Hints are alone &s;ufficient to mark out the dangerous Rocks, which lie in the Way to a &s;afe Harbour.</P></NOTE></P>
<PB N="47" REF="44">
<P>When a Patient has long &s;truggled with a Fever accompanied with Putrefaction, and, after twelve Days, no miliary Break|ings
<PB N="48" REF="45">out are ob&s;erv'd, it is u&s;ual that &s;mall wat'ry Bladders, from their Tran&s;parency, call'd cry&s;talline, appear in the Temples, Neck, and Brea&s;t, which often gradually ripen, and become full of Matter; the&s;e perform the Office of the former Erup|tions, by freeing the Blood of the noxious Ferment that di&s;turbs it, but not &s;o &s;afe|ly and effectually
<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is a Matter of Doubt with me, whether the&s;e Bladders do not rather <HI>only</HI> portend the gangrenous State of &s;ome Part of the Fluids, than that they are a critical Di&s;charge of the noxious Matter; any more than the Ve&s;ications, which are u&s;ual in Gangrenes of the Solids, free the di&s;eas'd Subject from the impending Danger, which, of Con&s;equence, threatens the Lo&s;s of the Limb, Life, or both.</NOTE>
.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that there is a Fe|ver, which I call hypochondriacal or hy&s;|teric, tho' it be not rang'd in the Cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="49" REF="46">of that Di&s;ea&s;e by any Authors, as far as I know, that, by its Similitude to the ma|lignant Kind, often impo&s;es on Phy&s;icians, and induces them to believe that it is of that Sort. And this is the only true Fe|ver of the Spirits, and which I have often &s;een. It imitates clo&s;ely the malignant Sort in the greate&s;t Parts of its Symptoms, but it differs in this, that the Exerci&s;e of their Rea&s;on is not interrupted, or &s;u&s;pend|ed, during its whole Cour&s;e, which runs out &s;ometimes to more than twenty Days; whereas mo&s;t commonly the Head is much, if not chiefly affected, and the Faculties of Rea&s;on and Memory are greatly di&s;|turb'd and broken, in malignant Fevers. Another Di&s;tinction is, that in the fir&s;t Sort the Patient is not troubled with Loo&s;ene&s;s, or Thru&s;h; nor do there ever appear in the Skin any miliary Eruptions, or Spots, of any Sort what&s;oever. But on the contrary, in the la&s;t Kind, &s;ome putrefied Matter is always excluded from the Blood, and determin'd to the Skin, or ought to be &s;o, if &s;ufficient Force remains in the Blood to
<PB N="50" REF="47">effect: it
<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Or if the Intention of Nature be not revers'd by Mal-practice.</NOTE>
. It is true, that in &s;imple Fevers, where no Parts of the Blood are corrupted, there needs no critical Separa|tion, but by Sweats and Tran&s;piration, which cool the feveri&s;h Flame, carry off the offen&s;ive Matter from the Blood, and re&s;tore Nature to its regular Con&s;titution; but, when many Parts of the Blood are ac|tually mortified, how can Nature ordina|rily be re&s;tor'd to a healthful State, with|out expelling them to the Skin? Can a Gangrene in the &s;olid Parts be heal'd till the &s;ound Fle&s;h be freed from the mortified Fibres? No more can the Ma&s;s of Blood be cur'd, till it is clear'd and purg'd from its putrid and peri&s;h'd Portions; which u&s;ually mu&s;t be done by excluding them from its Bo&s;om by friend|ly Sweats, or lodging them in the Surface of the Body; I &s;aid u&s;ually, becau&s;e &s;ome|times this putrid Matter may be di&s;charg'd by the Glands or Strainers of the Guts, tho' that does not often happen; for frequent|ly
<PB N="51" REF="48">the Loo&s;ene&s;s, that at the latter End at|tends malignant Fevers, if the Patient re|covers, is taken up by a Thru&s;h or &s;ore Mouth; and hence it appears, that the hypochondriacal Fever, mentioned before, has not the e&s;&s;ential Properties of the ma|lignant, and therefore does not ari&s;e from Putrefaction; tho' it is certain, that the malignant Kind have, at their Beginning, &s;uch a Conformity of Symptoms and Ap|pearances to hypochondriacal Pa&s;&s;ions, that it is difficult to di&s;cern, whether the Pa|tient be attack'd by a putrid Fever, or an hy&s;teric Di&s;order, or Perturbation of the Spirits: For In&s;tance, Chilne&s;s, Shiver|ings, and rigorous great Inquietude, Vo|mitings, Dejection of Appetite, Anxiety, Sickne&s;s, and immoderate Sweats, Wake|fulne&s;s, a low weak Pul&s;e, Faintne&s;s, and great Diminution of Strength, are Symptoms common to both; and therefore for &s;everal Days a malignant Fever has &s;o near a Re&s;emblance to one, that is only hy&s;teric, that many Phy&s;icians and Stan|ders-by,
<PB N="52" REF="49">I am apt to believe, <HI>mi&s;take the fir&s;t for the la&s;t,</HI> and look upon a great and dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e to be only the Spleen, or a Fit of the Vapours, to the great Ha|zard of the Patient.</P>

<PB N="77" REF="75">others think, but to propo&s;e faithfully my own Ob&s;ervations, in doing which, I beg the Reader's Patience, not his Fa|vour; for the Thing it&s;elf will &s;hortly &s;hew whether I have acted &s;incerely, or whether I have been a <HI>Man-&s;layer.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Only I beg Pardon, for that I have not regarded a pure Diction, or an elegant Style, being not at all heedful of <HI>nice</HI> Matters, if I only write &s;o as to be clearly under|&s;tood.</P>

<PB REF="76">
<HEAD>ADVICE TO THE APOTHECARIES.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not take upon me here to give Advice to all, for I know there are many of you undoubtedly hone&s;t, generous, and judicious, who &s;corn to be guilty of a mean or ba&s;e Action, either in public or private; but a much greater Number in City and Country, of the oppo&s;ite Charac|ter, are <HI>vilely</HI> indu&s;trious, ignorant, and penurious to a Sin; who &s;et no Value up|on Lives, and &s;tudy nothing &s;o much as ama&s;&s;ing Money <HI>at any Rate;</HI> there is ano|ther Species of you Gentlemen, who are Men of good natural Parts and genteel
<PB N="80" REF="77">Education, have been brought up regular|ly in Pharmacy, and by your ea&s;y Addre&s;s, and engaging Behaviour, attract E&s;teem, and command Employment in a great Number of Families; but are, on the other Hand, &s;o &s;trangely attach'd to Taverns and public Diver&s;ions, that you have neither Time or Inclination to make a <HI>right</HI> Pro|gre&s;s into the Knowledge of Di&s;ea&s;es or their Remedies: It is to you, of the&s;e <HI>two la&s;t</HI> oppo&s;ite Characters, that I pre&s;ent my Addre&s;s: Therefore, fir&s;t of all, let me in|treat you to be particularly careful in the Choice of the be&s;t Drugs, and exact in the Compo&s;ition of your Galenicals and Chy|micals; otherwi&s;e you hazard your Re|putation, deceive the Phy&s;ician, and ei|ther kill your Patients, or prolong the Di&s;ea&s;e, till <HI>Nature</HI> at length forcibly gets the better. How many People &s;uffer from <HI>bad Bark, Rhubarb, Ipeca|coanha Jalap, Ca&s;tor, Saffron,</HI> &amp;c.? The Dead are pa&s;t telling the Tale, but you your&s;elves mu&s;t be con&s;cious of it, or el&s;e confe&s;s your great <HI>Ignorance</HI> of Medicine;
<PB N="81" REF="78">many of you, as I &s;aid before, are too ge|nerous to act &s;o ba&s;e a Part; but a great Number are penurious to &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive Degree, that, altho' your exorbitant Profits exceed tho&s;e of any other Trade or Em|ployment in the whole World, you wou'd not <HI>privately</HI> advance a Shilling <HI>extraordi|nary</HI> to &s;ave the Life of the mo&s;t valuable Man in the Kingdom. How many <HI>perio|dical</HI> Ca&s;es bring on <HI>chronic</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es, and en&s;lave poor Mortals to a mi&s;erable Life, by the U&s;e of <HI>bad Bark?</HI> How do the vital Liquids run off, in <HI>Diarhoea's</HI> and <HI>Dy&s;enteries,</HI> from the U&s;e of the wor&s;t <HI>Rhu|barb, Ipecacoanha, Dia&s;cordium,</HI> &amp;c.? How much deceiv'd is the Phy&s;ician, when the Apothecary &s;ub&s;titutes a <HI>cheaper</HI> Medicine for a <HI>dearer,</HI> altho' the Price of the <HI>deare&s;t</HI> wou'd not amount to Six-pence a Do&s;e? <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> How many peri&s;h in Fevers, and linger on with other Di&s;ea&s;es, only for Want of <HI>good Drugs, Galenicals</HI> and <HI>Chy|micals?</HI> For God's Sake, Gentlemen, ye <HI>Surveyors-general,</HI> I &s;peak to now, who by Authority &s;earch the Apothecaries Shops,
<PB N="82" REF="79">Search them narrowly from Stem to Stern, and where you &s;ee Cau&s;e, give a &s;evere Reprimand; tho' you &s;hou'd forfeit the <HI>Six Shillings,</HI> which are u&s;ually given you, <HI>like Bolu&s;&s;es, to ea&s;e the Pain of your Sto|machs.</HI></P>
<P>The whole&s;ale Apothecaries and Chy|mi&s;ts are often the Sources of the&s;e ter|rible Di&s;a&s;ters, who ba&s;ely &s;ophi&s;ticate, for the Sake of a little Profit, Medicines which circulate not only through this Kingdom, but many foreign Countries, and de&s;troy five Times more People, than wou'd die of Di&s;tempers in a <HI>natural</HI> Way; and the Druggi&s;ts, who&s;e Principles are little bet|ter, for vending <HI>bad</HI> Drugs, excu&s;e them|&s;elves, by &s;aying, <HI>If they buy the Devil, they mu&s;t &s;ell the Devil;</HI> but, if the Apotheca|ries did not purcha&s;e him from Time to Time, they wou'd &s;oon be tir'd with ex|po&s;ing him to Sale.</P>
<P>When you have got <HI>good</HI> Medicines, I mu&s;t then be&s;eech you to learn the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of
<PB N="83" REF="80">them; <HI>but hold!</HI> you mu&s;t fir&s;t learn the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and know well how to di&s;tingui&s;h one from another; I &s;peak chiefly to you <HI>young Ones,</HI> tho' the <HI>old Ones,</HI> many of them, wou'd not do ami&s;s to take my Advice: For this Purpo&s;e, &s;earch out the be&s;t Authors, which will enrich your Sen&s;es; read them over and over again, till their mo&s;t remarkable Pre|cepts are &s;trongly impre&s;s'd on your Minds; but, in the mean time, ab&s;tain from Wine, and other &s;trong Liquors, le&s;t they drown all your <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Reflections, and hurt your Memory. Attend diligently the <HI>&s;ick Poor,</HI> as well as the <HI>Rich;</HI> for, tho' the lat|ter may be&s;t &s;uit your Pockets, the former will &s;erve you for experimental Knowledge, which in the End, if you have <HI>natural</HI> good Principles, will bring you more Sa|tisfaction, than the Mines of <HI>Mexico;</HI> but be e&s;pecially careful in your Experiments, that you do <HI>no Harm,</HI> for that &s;houd al|ways be your <HI>fir&s;t Principle</HI> in Practice. Whenever you venture out of the <HI>beaten</HI> Track, or even follow the <HI>old</HI> one, go on
<PB N="84" REF="81">with Caution in giving <HI>&s;mall</HI> Do&s;es of a <HI>doubtful</HI> Remedy, and be frequent in your Vi&s;its to &s;ee the Effect of it; then proceed gradually Step by Step, and never quit the Di&s;ea&s;e, or the Remedy, till you are Ma|&s;ter of both. When a Phy&s;ician attends your Patients, which you <HI>too often</HI> recom|mend, from, I am afraid, a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Sen&s;e of your own Inabilities, or to &s;well your Bill to a <HI>greater</HI> Bulk, don't think that your Bu&s;ine&s;s is <HI>then</HI> done, for it more nearly concerns you <HI>now</HI> to attend with Di|ligence, as you have a greater Work &s;et before you; now your timorous Mind is &s;et at Liberty, to in&s;pect narrowly into the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the Remedies pre|&s;crib'd by the Phy&s;ician, and to compare the Effects of them with your own Practice in the like Ca&s;es. The <HI>exorbitant</HI> Fees of the Doctor will &s;eldom admit of more than <HI>one</HI> Vi&s;it a Day, and that at a Time when, in <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;tempers, the frightful but <HI>informing</HI> Symptoms of the Night are ei|ther going, or chiefly gone off; therefore it is your Duty, if you have any Fellow-feeling
<PB N="85" REF="82">for your Patient, or Regard for your&s;elf, to be con&s;tant in your <HI>Evening-Attendance,</HI> that thereby you may be ready the next Day to give a ju&s;t Account of the Patient's Welfare or Sufferings, from the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Remedy, as well as to e&s;tabli&s;h your&s;elf firm in that Opinion of the Sick, by your <HI>Diligence,</HI> which coud not be brought about by your <HI>Judgment alone;</HI> this will never fail from Time to Time to advance your Reputation, till your Age and Succe&s;s fix you on a more &s;olid Foundation. But now pre&s;ents the <HI>di&s;mal</HI> Scene: To do all this, you mu&s;t leave your darling Plea&s;ures, Taverns, and Bottle Companions, Play-hou&s;es, Gaming-hou&s;es, and other public Diver&s;ions; to advance happily and &s;ucce&s;sfully in your Profe&s;&s;ion, and to arrive at the Pinacle of univer&s;al good Character and E&s;teem, you mu&s;t forego all jovial Appointments, for the Sake, &s;ometimes, of one Patient only, and even that a <HI>poor</HI> one, to whom you mu&s;t perhaps give your Advice and Medicines <HI>gratis;</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding that, has a
<PB N="86" REF="83"><HI>Life</HI> at Stake, as valuable in his Station as that of an Emperor; for his Family are his loving Subjects, and his Cottage is his Kingdom, which mu&s;t all droop and fall to Decay, after the Demi&s;e of their <HI>only</HI> King; therefore you mu&s;t ab&s;olutely at|tend him as diligently as the Rich, le&s;t, by a Surmi&s;e of Neglect, you lo&s;e more Re|putation in one Day, than you will be able to recover by the greate&s;t Diligence in many Months; e&s;pecially too, if you are but ju&s;t tenter'd into Life: Do but &s;ucceed, tho' <HI>Nature</HI> does all, you will have all the Glory; but, if you mi&s;carry, Shame and Confu&s;ion will be your Attendants, till, by Time and con&s;tant Rubbing, you are &s;uffi|ciently burni&s;h'd, to &s;tand the Fire of a cen&s;orious Age: This is a long Le&s;&s;on, a <HI>hard Ta&s;k;</HI> but be a&s;&s;ur'd from me, that you will not have it in your Power to make any <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> Figure in your Profe&s;&s;ion, accor|ding to the old Phra&s;e, <HI>till you have no Teeth to eat your Bread,</HI> without you pur&s;ue the Cour&s;e I have laid down; except indeed, as &s;ometimes happens, you have the Luck
<PB N="87" REF="84"><HI>to have the Bread put into your Mouths,</HI> by &s;ome well e&s;tabli&s;h'd Practitioners, who take you into Partner&s;hip in an <HI>early</HI> Age: This is the good Fortune of &s;ome remark|able <HI>Boobies,</HI> who, from not being able to get Shoes and Stockings, if they were &s;et on their <HI>own</HI> Legs <HI>barefoot,</HI> begin &s;oon to get an E&s;tate; while others of Merit, Knowledge, and Succe&s;s, are oblig'd to trudge early and late, only for the Sake of a genteel Support.</P>
<P>Now I have explain'd the Duty which more immediately concerns the Apothecary, I will give you farther In&s;tructions for the Benefit of your Patients, which will not altogether be u&s;ele&s;s to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Be &s;ure to keep a watchful Eye over the &s;leepy <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> Nur&s;es, &s;uffer no Error or Neglect in their Conduct to pa&s;s unregarded, as many of you do, to gain their E&s;teem, and thence their Commendation, or other|wi&s;e to avoid their weak and low A&s;per|&s;ions,
<PB N="88" REF="85">and ungrounded Prejudices: Pay the &s;ame Deference al&s;o to the <HI>mighty knowing</HI> Midwives, who are only a better Sort of Locu&s;ts, that will take the Bread out of your Mouths, if you do not &s;mother their Errors, and proclaim their Qualifications; but mind this, you mu&s;t be thorough-pac'd in your Profe&s;&s;ion, and have given repeat|ed Proofs of your Judgment, before you make this hazardous Attempt, <HI>Nothing le&s;s than a forlorn Hope;</HI> for Women are, by a Sort of Infatuation, &s;o exce&s;&s;ive fond of this Sort of Creatures, who from thence take &s;uch Liberties, that &s;ometimes even in de|&s;perate Ca&s;es, they will, with an uncommon Stock of Impudence, tell you to your Face, in their Language, that <HI>&s;ure they have not been &s;o many Years Nur&s;es or Midwives, but that they know what belongs to the Cure of &s;uch and &s;uch an Ailment, better than a young Apothecary.</HI> This you mu&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly oppo&s;e, and never leave them, till you have fairly prov'd that they are Fools and Lyars; otherwi&s;e, in Return, they will, much to
<PB N="89" REF="86">your Di&s;advantage, prove you to be a very <HI>ignorant Fellow,</HI> which will &s;oon &s;pread a|mong&s;t the neighbouring Women, your <HI>Body Guards;</HI> but then, I &s;ay, you mu&s;t be con&s;cious that you certainly know how to vanqui&s;h the Di&s;order, which has &s;et you at Variance, or mu&s;t come to a Parley up|on wor&s;e Terms. But, leaving this Di|gre&s;&s;ion, conde&s;cend to examine the &s;everal liquid Foods you have order'd for your Patients Sub&s;i&s;tence; be not content with one or two Sorts only, but have Plenty where it can be admitted, that the con&s;tant Supply which is nece&s;&s;ary not only for the Di&s;ea&s;e, but from the Quality of the Me|dicines, may not nau&s;eate the Stomach, and rob you of Part of your Dependance in the Cure of the Patient; and indeed nothing contributes more to the Ea&s;e and Satisfaction of the Sick, than Choice of Liquors properly made; for weak Sto|machs are &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>As the Phy&s;ician is often di&s;charg'd, &s;o &s;oon as the Danger is over, the future Con|duct
<PB N="90" REF="87">of the Patient lies wholly upon your Care; therefore now is the Time to be&s;tir your&s;elf, to procure a perfect Recovery, by continuing the Medicines order'd by the Phy&s;ician; for at your Peril do not alter them, le&s;t by any Accident the Patient &s;houd grow wor&s;e, and you incur the Blame; I &s;ay, continue the Medicines, as long they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but <HI>no longer,</HI> and take upon you, with <HI>becoming</HI> Authority, to order the nece&s;&s;ary Diet from Time to Time, and &s;trictly &s;crutinize into the Execution of your Orders; which will not only always gain the Attention and E&s;teem of the whole Family, but convince them of your upright Intention to prevent a Relap&s;e.</P>
<P>One Thing more I mu&s;t add, and that is this, Revere the Profe&s;&s;ion to which you belong, and treat every Member of it, who &s;hall <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it, with the utmo&s;t Marks of Sincerity and Re&s;pect; be not re&s;erv'd, but with an <HI>engaging</HI> Air and Freedom, in your
<PB N="91" REF="88">mutual Corre&s;pondence, communicate eve|ry Thing you know for the public Wel|fare; <HI>let no good Thing be buried in the Grave, the Seat of Oblivion;</HI> be courteous and affable to all Mankind, e&s;pecially the <HI>&s;ick Poor,</HI> who, in their great Di&s;tre&s;s have little el&s;e to alleviate their Sorrows, than your &s;ympathizing Nature, mild Deport|ment, and benevolent Hand; in &s;hort, al|ways endeavour to act the Part of the <HI>real</HI> Gentleman, which, if you do not gain Riches, will generally procure you a con|tented Mind, the next Step to a happy Life.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Requi&s;ites, which, I have told you in my Preface, mu&s;t be join'd with the Phy&s;ician and his Pre&s;criptions, in order to a happy and &s;ucce&s;sful Prac|tice: But what with the <HI>Pride, Inability,</HI> and <HI>Self-conceit</HI> of <HI>many</HI> Phy&s;icians, the <HI>Negligence, Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Penury</HI> of <HI>many</HI> Apothecaries, <HI>Sophi&s;tication</HI> and <HI>Villainy</HI> of <HI>many</HI> Chymi&s;ts and Druggi&s;ts, I mu&s;t, upon
<PB N="92" REF="89">the Whole, conclude, that we are, in <HI>ge|neral,</HI> in no proper Condition to make <HI>many great</HI> Advances or Improvements in Phy&s;ick.</P>
