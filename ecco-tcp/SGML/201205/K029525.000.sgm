<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE putrid Sore-Throat has &s;o long continued in this na|tion, almo&s;t every year with a new train of &s;ymptoms, as the celebrated Dr. Fothergill fore&s;aw, "it is pro|bable, &s;ays that great practitioner, in his Account on the Sore-Throat, that this kind of Sore-Throat may continue among&s;t us for the future, breaking out with more or le&s;s &s;e|verity, as &s;ea&s;on, &s;ituation, and
<PB N="vi" REF="3">other circum&s;tances may concur." And in another place, he &s;ays, "It may al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the di&s;ea&s;e is de&s;cribed as it appear|ed in 1747 and 1748; that if the &s;ymptoms &s;hould hereafter vary in any circum&s;tance, the diver&s;ity may be attributed to the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and not imputed to de&s;ign or inattention," a de&s;crip|tion therefore of this raging di&s;ea&s;e can never be thought u&s;ele&s;s, e&s;pe|cially as the &s;ymptoms &s;eem to dif|fer in &s;ome re&s;pect from the for|mer.</P>
<P>I am con&s;cious that an accurate de&s;cription of di&s;ea&s;es, and their me|thod of treatment, requires both great
<PB N="vii" REF="4">abilities and great practice, neither of which I am able to boa&s;t; but as I have had in this di&s;ea&s;e frequent opportunities of making various ob&s;ervations, as a great many came under my in&s;pection, I think it nei|ther pre&s;umption nor arrogance to lay them along with the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;es before the Publick; per|haps it may excite men of greater &s;agacity and practice, to give the world their more preci&s;e and more learned ob&s;ervations, and then I &s;hall not think my labour ineffec|tual or unrewarded.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_ABOUT the 15th of July, a Sore-Throat of the malig|nant kind, nearly &s;uch as de&s;cribed by Dr. Fothergill, and Dr. Huxham, (only without the ef|flore&s;cence, and attended with co&s;tivene&s;s) made its appearance among children from three to &s;even years of age, by which many were cut off in the &s;pace of &s;ix or eight days; &s;ome by &s;uffocation, and others by vomiting of blood: at the &s;ame time, a complaint of a roughne&s;s in the throat,
<PB N="10" REF="7">mo&s;t probably ari&s;ing from a deprivation of its mucus, prevailed among adults, with|out the lea&s;t appearance of ulceration or malignancy, which however in a few days yielded to an external application of the volatile liniment or camphorated oil.</P>
<P>About the beginning of Augu&s;t, the &s;ame Sore-Throat extended its baleful in|fluence more generally, chiefly attacking children from three to ten years of age, and al&s;o a few adults, of a lax and ill habit of body; in &s;ome it was very malignant, joined with an ery&s;ipelato&s;e inflammation and a diarrhea; the degree of malignancy however &s;eemed to have been more adapted to the &s;ituation than to the con&s;titution of the patients, in&s;omuch that the di&s;ea&s;e was very fierce in low, mar&s;hy, and con|fined, and extremely benign in high and open places; thus in <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> and <HI>High|gate</HI> it was very &s;light, whereas in <HI>Kenti&s;h|town</HI> it raged with great fury, and in <HI>End|field-Chace</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8">it &s;wept away many in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e was not uniform, but &s;eemed to have been of two kinds; in &s;ome there appear|ed only a &s;uperficial whitene&s;s on the <HI>uvula Ton&s;ils</HI> and <HI>velum palatinum,</HI> whil&s;t in others tho&s;e parts were be&s;et with thick ulcerations, running very deep in the fauces, &s;o as to be almo&s;t invi&s;ible; in both &s;pecies however, about the &s;econd or third d y, hard &s;wel|lings appeared externally on each &s;ide the neck, almo&s;t meeting together upon the throat, which occa&s;ioned a &s;tiffne&s;s of the neck, la&s;ting in &s;ome for a month.</P>
<P>Though the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e was dif|ferent in different per&s;ons, yet mo&s;t of them were taken with a nau&s;ea and &s;hiverings, &s;uc|ceeded by heat and an efflore&s;cence over the brea&s;t and extremities, and often the whole body was of a crim&s;on red; &s;ome were &s;pread over with a kind of little millets, &s;imilar to that in the miliary fever, and which &s;caled off the &s;kin the &s;ixth or &s;e|venth
<PB N="12" REF="9">day; in which ca&s;es the ulcerations were very &s;light, as al&s;o all other &s;ymptoms of malignancy: in all the different kinds of the efflore&s;cence, mo&s;t of the patients com|plained of a violent itching, and had a dry and hot &s;kin; the pul&s;e was commonly &s;mall, quick, and &s;ometimes fluttering and unequal; the mouth full of &s;loughs, the teeth black and covered with a cru&s;t; the tongue white, &s;ometimes a little furred, but frequently be&s;et with bli&s;ters; the lips parched; the <HI>ton&s;ils</HI> and <HI>uvula</HI> were of|ten &s;o much enlarged, that every thing at|tempted to be &s;wallowed was ejected by the no&s;e; the urine was commonly di&s;charged in &s;mall quantities, high coloured, and a thin cloud &s;u&s;pended in its middle; &s;ome di&s;charged a &s;mall quantity of blood for a few days out of the no&s;e; the no&s;e was &s;tuffed up with a greeni&s;h <HI>&s;anies,</HI> which dropped out continually, and &s;eemed not to be of an excoriating nature, but rather to occa&s;ion only a &s;light titillation, as a con&s;tant picking of the no&s;e was ob&s;erva|ble
<PB N="13" REF="10">in all tho&s;e ca&s;es. Some were co&s;tive, whil&s;t others were afflicted with a &s;pecies of an autumnal dy&s;entry, as their &s;tools ap|peared knotty, &s;uch as de&s;cribed by my ingenious and &s;agacious friend, Dr. Wil&s;on, in his treati&s;e on the Autumnal Dy&s;entry; the purging and efflore&s;cence however did not &s;eem to corre&s;pond with one another; for, fir&s;t, the di&s;appearance of the one &s;el|dom aggravated the other; &s;econdly, they were often concomitant; thirdly, &s;ome|times a co&s;tivene&s;s attended, though there was not any efflore&s;cence; nor did the efflore&s;cence appear to be a critical di&s;|charge, as is the ca&s;e in eruptive di&s;ea&s;es of the malignant kind, for the efflore&s;cence and the Sore-Throat were often met with &s;eparately. A cough attended in mo&s;t throughout the whole di&s;ea&s;e, probably occa&s;ioned by the irritation of the <HI>larynx;</HI> great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, dejection of &s;pirits, a total inactivity, a delirium, a pul&s;e that beat 140 or 145 in a minute, and a great di&s;ponae, were fatal omens.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<P>It was remarkable that though mo&s;t of the young patients had a great aver&s;ion to all manner of food, yet they &s;eemed not un|willing to take medicines, which made me imagine that immediate relief was found from it.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e had neither an apparent cri&s;is, nor any regular progre&s;s; for all the &s;ymptoms often vani&s;hed of a &s;udden about the eighth or ninth day, whil&s;t at other times they were at a &s;tand for about 14 days; but frequently they dimini&s;hed or increa&s;ed from the 10th to the 14th or 15th day, when either a total recovery was &s;een, excepting the external &s;welling, which la&s;ted often for weeks; or the &s;cene of life was clo&s;ed, the patient &s;uffocating or expiring in a lingering way. In one ca&s;e only, which I &s;hall mention hereafter, I beheld all the malignant &s;ymptoms in the highe&s;t degree, the patient labouring under them for three weeks, and at la&s;t reco|vered.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="12">
<P>An oedematous &s;welling, after the ab|&s;ence of all the fatal &s;ymptoms, and when nothing but an entire recovery was ex|pected, appeared to be very frequent in children of an ill habit of body; the lips, no&s;e and face were bloated, &s;allow, &s;hining, and grea&s;y, as it were, which &s;welling &s;pread it&s;elf &s;ometimes over one &s;ide, and at others over the whole body, e&s;pecially the abdo|men; the &s;welling I have ob&s;erved to in|crea&s;e always in the morning, and to abate towards evening. Dr. Huxham, in his di&s;&s;ertation on the Malignant Ulce|rous Sore-Throat, has ob&s;erved the &s;ame; but only "before the fatal period," not after a total recovery; nor does he take notice of that particular circum&s;tance concerning its increa&s;e and abatement, dif|ferent from all other drop&s;ical &s;wellings: however, &s;ome have been carried off by it a month after the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e, whil&s;t many recovered by the u&s;e of proper cathartics and full do&s;es of the bark.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="13">
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e was &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for the mea&s;les, not only becau&s;e the cough being an idiopatic &s;ymptom of the &s;ame, but becau&s;e the efflore&s;cence in the benign kind was &s;o very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the mea&s;les, and which were al&s;o epidemical the latter end of Augu&s;t: great mi&s;chief would have been done in treating it according to the mi&s;take, with expectorants, opiates, and antiphlogi&s;tics; but the very a&s;pect of the throat, even in the benign kind, the ex|ternal &s;wellings, and the cough it&s;elf &s;o different from that of the mea&s;les, where it is much &s;tronger and deeper, if I am allowed this expre&s;&s;ion, could &s;oon detect the error; though I had often occa&s;ion to think that &s;ome patients were attacked with both di&s;ea&s;es at once, and then I have treated them accordingly.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider that in this epidemic the efflore&s;cence appeared often indepen|dent of the <HI>angina,</HI> and was &s;imilar to the miliary or &s;carlet fever, that further, no
<PB N="17" REF="14">great connexion has been ob&s;erved be|tween the <HI>diarrhoea</HI> and the efflore&s;cence, and the di&s;appearance of the latter did not always aggravate the former; more|over, that often a con&s;tipation accompanied the whole di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;ence of the efflore&s;cence; again, that both the angina and the ery&s;epelato&s;e in|flammation often appeared &s;eparately, and that the &s;tools were &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the autumnal dy&s;entry; I &s;ay, con&s;idering all the&s;e circum&s;tances, it &s;eems as if the efflore&s;cence were not always a critical di&s;charge, as is the ca&s;e in mo&s;t putrid di&s;ea&s;es of the pu&s;tular kind; but that the genuine and principal di&s;ea&s;e was the epidemic Sore-Throat, which began early in &s;ummer, and con&s;equently, to &s;peak in the language of Sydenham, was either an early autumnal, or a late vernal epidemic, to which in autumn two other epidemics, namely, either the &s;carlet or mi|liary fever, and a purging, like the autumnal dy&s;entry were joined; the fir&s;t, and genuine
<PB N="18" REF="15">epidemic, namely, the Sore-Throat, being at the &s;ame time predominant, as often ob&s;erved by the great Sydenham; and though that great ob&s;erver attributed epi|demics to the occult, and not to the &s;en&s;i|ble qualities of the air, yet latter ob&s;er|vers favour the contrary opinion, as it appears from the writings of Dr. <HI>Shaw, Arbuthnot</HI> on Air, Dr. <HI>Hale</HI>'s Statical Ex|periments, Dr. Huxham <HI>de aere et morb. epid.</HI> and others; and it is very probable, that the pre&s;ent aro&s;e from the frequent &s;howers and &s;tormy winds, which continu|ed the greate&s;t part of June and July, though often with ea&s;terly winds, yet the &s;un piercing through the clouds in the intervals of the &s;howers might have much contributed to the epidemic in que&s;tion, warning the floating vapours, and pro|ducing a change in the con&s;titution of the air, which, when bred in, has in adults, only affected the mucus membrane of the Throat, and occa&s;ioned there a roughne&s;s; whereas in child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en, and tho&s;e of a lax|habit,
<PB N="19" REF="16">it has introduced its malignancy deep|er, and brought on putrid ulceration; the &s;ultry and warm autumn then approaching has rou&s;ed again, as it were, the lurking epidemic, which then &s;pread it&s;elf more general, and more malignant joined with two autumnal epidemics: the&s;e, how|ever, are only probable conjectures, which I &s;hall quit, and return to the method of treating the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As the principal di&s;ea&s;e was of the malignant kind, anti&s;ceptics, the king of which the bark may ju&s;tly be called, were the fir&s;t indications, a vomit has &s;ome|times cut the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hort, and which, in the fir&s;t on&s;et of the di&s;ea&s;e, ought never to be omitted, as it rou&s;es the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and the principles of life, the energy of which it &s;o much depends upon in the removal of putrid di&s;ea&s;es; and as it clears the &s;tomach of its crudities; for the powers of dige&s;tion are always im|paired in putrid attacks, e&s;pecially in the
<PB N="20" REF="17">pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where mo&s;t probably the <HI>oe&s;ophagus,</HI> and perhaps the &s;tomach it&s;elf were affected: however, as mo&s;t com|monly phy&s;ical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ought for &s;ome days after the inva&s;ion, emetics could not always have been admini&s;tered with &s;afety, e&s;pecially when the fauces were much ulcerated. The admi&s;&s;ion of free and pure air was highly recommended, as many pati|ents panted for the free air, and which I never found doing any harm, in&s;omuch that three children afflicted with the di&s;|ea&s;e came to me every other day at the A&s;ylum, which Ca&s;es I &s;hall mention here-after. The room in which the patient lay was frequently &s;prinkled with vinegar; a gargle, or rather an injection in the Throat, was admini&s;tered of a &s;trong de|coction of the bark and the tincture of myrrh, with which al&s;o the mouth was continually wa&s;hed: internally, the bark was given, &s;ometimes with the &s;pirit of minderery, and at others with the cardiac confection, according to the degree of the
<PB N="21" REF="18">fever. The camphorated oil, or the vola|tile leniment, was applied to di&s;per&s;e the external &s;wellings; for as they &s;eemed to be of a malignant nature, it was not ad|vi&s;eable to invite, by poulticing them, more humours thither, for fear of converting a greater quantity of matter into a malig|nant nature, and con&s;equently increa&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e; nor did bli&s;ters &s;eem to have been of any efficacy in either le&s;&s;ening the degree of the malignancy or the &s;ize of the &s;wellings, though, in compliance with common practice, they were &s;ometimes ordered, when they occa&s;ioned a great di&s;|charge of a thick matter, but without the lea&s;t relief to the patient; bleeding and antiphlogi&s;tics were &s;eldom requi&s;ite; and tho&s;e who have been treated in the &s;trict cold regimen were only protracted in their mi&s;ery. In ca&s;es of co&s;tivene&s;s, I ordered for the patient to eat prunes boiled with &s;ena and a little of the powder of ginger in it, as they &s;erved al&s;o for nouri&s;hment, e&s;pecially as there was an aver&s;ion to all
<PB N="22" REF="19">manner of food. Where a purging atten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed it was moderated by cordials, and often only by the bark, with the addition of the <HI>confect. card.</HI> or a few drops of the <HI>tinct. thebaic.</HI> and which relieved the pa|tient often by bringing on a gentle diapho|ra&s;is, to promote which, plenty of warm and diluting liquors were al&s;o recommended.</P>
<P>The oedematous &s;welling, that appeared in many eight days after a total recovery, was be&s;t removed by repeated do&s;es of ca|lomel and rhubarb, and full do&s;es of the bark; and as far as I have been able to ob|&s;erve, that dreadful &s;ymptom &s;eldom hap|pened where proper cathartics were admi|ni&s;tered after the di&s;ea&s;e, to carry off the remainder of the putrid <HI>colluvies,</HI> lodging in the inte&s;tinal tube.</P>
<P>As in many ca&s;es the young patients could not be prevailed upon to take medi|cines, a foot, bath of bran, and &s;ometimes catapla&s;ms of hor&s;e-radi&s;h and mu&s;tard were
<PB N="23" REF="20">ordered with &s;ucce&s;s, both in pro|moting by their &s;timulus the energy of the nerves, and in bringing on a revul&s;ion: and indeed, as in Germany &s;uch methods are too frequently u&s;ed, &s;o are they here too much neglected. That applications to the lower region have a great influence upon the up|per parts of the &s;y&s;tem, is evident from the following &s;imple experiment: I felt often a coughing and a <HI>di&s;pon</HI> coming on &s;uddenly, upon holding may feet in cold water, which &s;hews the great &s;ympathy between the nerves of the feet and tho&s;e of the lung, diaphragm, and of the <HI>trachi,</HI> &s;o that cold applied to the feet will irritate the nerves of the lungs, &amp;c. Upon the &s;ame principle, any &s;timulus ap|plied, to the feet will rou&s;e the nerves of the upper region, and give them energy. Such remote applications mu&s;t even have a better effect than when the &s;timulus is applied immediately to the affected parts, or near them, for it may often bring on alarming &s;ymptoms, by increa&s;ing the
<PB N="24" REF="21">weakne&s;s of the already debilitated and ten|der parts, as I have &s;een putrefactions take place where the bli&s;ter was, when applied near the affected part, and which putrefac|tion made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s, that it was not in the power of art to &s;top it; remote applications therefore, &s;uch as catapla&s;ms and &s;emicupiums, are certainly more &s;a|lutary and le&s;s dangerous: not to mention the inconvenience ari&s;ing from bli&s;ters, when the cantharides are ab&s;orbed in a &s;y&s;|tem that has a tendency to putrefaction. Even in deliriums, applications to the feet, &s;uch as mentioned above, are preferable to either bli&s;ters or opiates, for the former may often increa&s;e the delirium by in|crea&s;ing its cau&s;e, debility, as ob&s;erved be|fore, and the latter may aggravate the di&s;|ea&s;e, by dimini&s;hing the &s;en&s;ibility, and con&s;equently the energy of the nerves, &s;o requi&s;ite to counteract all putrid dia&s;tha&s;is. The &s;emicupium is frequently u&s;ed in Germany in the beginning of eruptive di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially in the &s;mall-pox, where
<PB N="25" REF="22">it often relieves the nobler parts from their fatal inva&s;ion. Dr. Wil&s;on a&s;&s;ured me, that he always ordereth it, and never found any dangerous con&s;equence of a paraly&s;es, as has been in&s;inuated by &s;ome; but as the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the &s;mall-pox, might not the &s;e|micupium be of the &s;ame u&s;e?</P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG lady of a delicate habit of body, about &s;ix years old, was taken September the 22d, 1777, with all the &s;ymptoms at once; a nau&s;ea, great fainting, and an efflore&s;cence all over the body, much like little mellets, a difficulty of &s;wallowing, &s;tiffne&s;s of the neck, and co&s;tivene&s;s; under which &s;ymptoms &s;he laboured three days, on the fourth I &s;aw her, and found a &s;mall ulceration on the <HI>uvula</HI> and <HI>ton&s;ils,</HI> with a large &s;welling of each &s;ide the throat; her pul&s;e was 130, the &s;kin dry and hot, the urine high colour|ed, and a cloud &s;u&s;pended in it, no &s;anies di&s;charge of the no&s;e, though &s;he picked it continually; the palate much inflamed, and the tongue white; I ordered a vomit, bli&s;tered the top of the neck, recommended the admi&s;&s;ion of free air, and the bark was
<PB N="27" REF="24">mini&s;tered, with the addition of 8 drops of the <HI>theb. tinct.</HI> in the night draught; there was neither a di&s;ponoe nor the u&s;ual croaking noi&s;e; the volatile liniment was applied to the &s;wellings, and the mouth was continually wa&s;hed with a decoction of the bark, and tinct. of myrrh; the &s;ymptoms began to &s;ub&s;ide daily, and the ninth day &s;he was quite recovered, only that a &s;tiffne&s;s in the neck remained; the efflore&s;cence al&s;o remaining till the four|teenth day, when it began to &s;cale off.

<P>MERRYMAN, a girl about &s;even years of age, was taken, October 14th, with a nau&s;ea, vomiting, and a diarrhoea, the &s;econd day the &s;ickne&s;s abated; but a purging of knotty &s;tools &s;till remained; a &s;welling appeared on both &s;ides the neck, which almo&s;t met together upon the throat; her pul&s;e was 135; there was a di&s;charge of a &s;anies matter through the no&s;e; the mouth full of &s;lime and &s;lough, the teeth very black, the tongue furred, &s;he picked her no&s;e con&s;tantly, and the <HI>uvula</HI> and <HI>ton|&s;ils</HI> were &s;o much enlarged, that every thing taken in the mouth could hardly be &s;wal|lowed, but was ejected by the no&s;e. Here the great u&s;e of medicines was &s;o obvious, in&s;omuch, that whenever the child could not be prevailed on to take them, all the &s;ymptoms grew wor&s;e; yet as &s;oon as the
<PB N="29" REF="26">medicines mentioned in Ca&s;e I. were taken, an amazing change followed. As I &s;aw the child in this &s;tate of alternate relap&s;e and recovery for fifteen days, I would not tru&s;t any longer to her whims, but ordered gly&s;ters, which her mother would not give her; I had then refuge to &s;emi|cupiums and catapla&s;ms, by which means all the &s;ymptoms gradually abated; and though that child &s;eemed to recover in a lingering way, yet in the beginning of November &s;he was &s;o much better, that &s;he conde&s;cended to take the bark, and which in a few days re&s;tored her entirely.</P>

<P>OCTOBER the 5th I was called to &s;ee two &s;i&s;ters, the one eight and the other nine years of age; both had the confluent &s;mall-pox &s;ix months before;
<PB N="30" REF="27">they were &s;o malignant in the younge&s;t, that the apothecary then attending de&s;|paired of her recovery, which proves that her con&s;titution was much di&s;po&s;ed to putridity: however, both were &s;eized with nau&s;ea, &s;hivering succeeded by heat, great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;trength and inactivity. They were in a comato&s;e &s;tate; the throat was ulcerated, but the ulceration was &s;o deep in the fauces as to be hardly perceptible; the tongue was full of bli&s;|ters, white, and a little furred; the lips black and parched; the teeth very black; an efflore&s;cence all over the body; great &s;welling on each &s;ide the neck, and a purging of knotty &s;tools attended; the pul&s;e of the younge&s;t beat 140 in a mi|nute, and that of the elde&s;t 130, and in general all the &s;ymptoms were more vio|lent in the younge&s;t. I ordered, a vomit; the cortex with the <HI>confect. card.</HI> to be taken internally; the mouth to be wa&s;hed, and the throat to be &s;yringed with a de|coction of the bark, and the tinct. of

The elde&s;t, however, mended gradually, and was entirely reco|vered the 19th, went abroad, eat and drank hearty; but to my greate&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, the 25th, her no&s;e and lips began to be bloated, and of a grea&s;y look; an oedematous &s;wel|ling &s;pread it&s;elf over her right &s;ide and abdomen which increa&s;ed remarkably towards morning. Repeated do&s;es of calomel and rhubarb were admini&s;tered, and the bark in full do&s;es; the &s;wel|lings, &s;eemed to, abate the third day after
<PB N="32" REF="29">its inva&s;ion; but the fourth and fifth day the child could not &s;wallow at all, and convul&s;ive fits, the la&s;t &s;truggle of life, clo&s;ed the mi&s;erable &s;cene on the 29th of October.</P>

<PB N="38" REF="35">
<P>MY ingenious friend, Dr. Lett&s;om, who&s;e practice is exten&s;ive and ob&s;ervations accurate, informed me, that he generally ob&s;erved that a fever, with alternate &s;hi|verings and hot fits, and a pain and diffi|culty in &s;wallowing, attended the fir&s;t on|&s;et of this di&s;ea&s;e; a nau&s;ea, head-ach, re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, and a &s;en&s;ation of general &s;orene&s;s of the body, and other &s;ymptoms of fever, were, al&s;o pre&s;ent in greater or le&s;s degree, even before any ulceration of the <HI>ton&s;ils</HI> took place; its approach how|ever might be a&s;certained by the enlarge|ment of the&s;e glands, and the livid ap|pearance and turge&s;cence of their ve&s;&s;els. An efflore&s;cence of the &s;kin mo&s;t general|ly appeared at this time, and a flu&s;hing and bloatedne&s;s of the face.</P>
<P>The ulcerations of the <HI>ton&s;ils</HI> u&s;ually be|gan to &s;lough off about the fourth or fifth day, but a low remittent fever continued frequently for &s;ome days afterwards, as did
<PB N="39" REF="36">likewi&s;e the efflore&s;cence; and as the fever cea&s;ed, this gradually vani&s;hed, and fell off in bran-like &s;cales, and all the &s;ymp|toms &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>When the angina was more violent in its attack, the &s;loughs were not removed till the &s;eventh or eighth day; about which period, when the patient appeared more favourable, con&s;iderable and unequal &s;wel|lings in one or both &s;ides of the neck aro&s;e, and the&s;e, if not di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in two or three days, formed large tedious &s;up|purations, which either di&s;charged ex|ternally, or behind the <HI>uvula,</HI> or carried off the patient by &s;uffocation, or by de|bility; but mo&s;t generally in the&s;e ma|lignant ca&s;es the ulcerations &s;pread infe|riorly, producing the angina trachaealis, which often proved fatal in grown per&s;ons, as well as in infants. The&s;e ulcerations likewi&s;e extended along the whole, mem|branes of the mouth and no&s;trils; in &s;uch in&s;tances particularly, a delirium almo&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="37">con&s;tantly &s;upervened, and many died in a &s;tate of raving, which made him &s;u&s;pect that the ery&s;ipelatous inflammation might extend to the membranes contiguous to the brain.</P>
<P>The eruption often put on a peculiar appearance in this virulent &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e; in&s;tead of falling off in &s;cales, numerous little &s;uppurations might be di&s;|covered upon the &s;kin, a little larger than the miliary eruption, and &s;ometimes as broad as a &s;ilver penny; they contained purulent matter, which might be di&s;co|vered upon opening them.</P>
<P>A dy&s;entery &s;ometimes preceded the an|gina, oftener however it came on about the third or fourth day; the di&s;charges were dark-coloured, offen&s;ive and thin. Dy&s;enteries al&s;o prevailed with angina, particularly in October. While it was requi&s;ite to evacuate the&s;e foetid conge&s;ti|ons in the abdomen by mild means; large
<PB N="41" REF="38">and &s;udden evacuations were apt to aug|ment the debility.</P>
<P>Dr. Lett&s;om al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the country in the vicinity of London, &s;uf|fered much likewi&s;e, e&s;pecially in the vil|lages, in low mar&s;hy &s;ituations, wherein the di&s;ea&s;e raged through the &s;ummer, as well as in the &s;pring and autumn of 1777, and proved full as fatal as in the metro|polis.</P>
<P>When he was con&s;ulted at the com|mencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, he generally began the cure by an antimonial emetic, given in &s;mall and repeated do&s;es till it vomited, by which much bilious fluids were di&s;charged; and as &s;oon as the ope|ration was over, he did not he&s;itate to ex|hibit the bark, either in decoction or in &s;ub&s;tance, although the fever was then con&s;iderable; it &s;eldom appeared to him to increa&s;e it, or the dy&s;pnoea which of|ten attended the angina. Occa&s;ionally,
<PB N="42" REF="39">however, where the fever was very vio|lent, he intervened emotic tartar in &s;mall do&s;es as a relaxant, and joined neutralized lemon juice with the cortox: when a diarrhaea was alarming, the confectio car|diaca was added, and &s;mall do&s;es of the|baic tincture; &s;ometimes with rhubarb, or &s;mall do&s;es of ipecacoanha in&s;tead of the emetie tartar; but throughout the whole progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e the bark was &s;eldom relinqui&s;hed. Cordial drinks and acidulated liquors formed a part of the diet. He u&s;ually pre&s;cribed the volatile liniment to the fauces and throat; but where there was danger of &s;uffocation, he applied bli&s;ters to the neck. They &s;ome|times appeared to him to have beneficial effects; but he ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e anginas which terminated in tedious glandular &s;uppurations of the neck, had been previou&s;ly treated with vi&s;icatories; from whence it was &s;u&s;pected, whether the &s;timulus of the cantharides had not excited this trouble&s;ome and dangerous
<PB N="43" REF="40">&s;ymptom, and thereby rather increa&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened the danger of &s;uffocation.</P>
<P>He &s;eldom found the delirium and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s which accompanied the an|gina, yielded to an opiate, they were &s;ometimes increa&s;ed by it, but that pedi|luvium and fomentations of vinegar and water to the legs produced a more &s;alu|tary effect; when both were u&s;ed to|gether, the opiate u&s;ually produced a more &s;alutary effect.</P>
<P>Out of &s;everal ca&s;es of glandular &s;up|purations which have occurred to him in practice, he has favoured me with the following ca&s;es and di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P>Mary Pulling, aged nine years, was attacked on the 13th of May, 1777, with rigors and vomiting, which were &s;uc|ceeded by fever, and efflore&s;cence of the &s;kin. I fir&s;t vi&s;ited her on the 17th; the
<PB N="44" REF="41">heat was then exce&s;&s;ive, and the efflore&s;|cence general; the pul&s;e beat about 130 in a minute; a &s;light cough was occa&s;ionally excited, and a delirium now and then prevailed: &s;he complained of a &s;orene&s;s of the throat, which I found to be ul|cerated.</P>
<P>Cordial remedies were admini&s;tered, with preparations of the bark. Laxa|tives were occa&s;ionally pre&s;cribed, and mild opiates when nece&s;&s;ity required. The volatile liniment was applied to the throat and fauces, and gargles were care|fully u&s;ed. About the 6th day, a bli&s;ter was applied behind each ear.</P>
<P>In about ten days time no &s;ymptoms of the angina appeared; the fever had &s;ub|&s;ided, and the efflore&s;cence of the &s;kin had vani&s;hed; but the &s;trength was reduced, and the nouri&s;hment and drinks which the patient &s;wallowed were di&s;charged by
<PB N="45" REF="42">vomiting; at the &s;ame time neither a diffi|culty of breathing nor of &s;wallowing oc|curred. Opiates did not &s;ubdue the vo|miting; mineral acids had no effect, and laxatives did not divert this by opening another di&s;charge; and even quick&s;ilve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> was ejected. The want of nutrition would augment the debility, to obviate which broth cly&s;ters were recommended; and to take off the determination to the &s;tomach, a bli&s;ter was applied to each foot. The vomiting, however, never &s;ub&s;ided till the 12th of June, when the emaciated pati|ent expired, without either previous dy&s;|pnoea, catarrh, or difficult deglutition.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the patient was opened by Surgeon Vaux, in the pre&s;ence of Dr. Hulme, and other medical gentlemen.</P>
<P>The brain was found in a perfect &s;tate. The inte&s;tines al&s;o did not appear di&s;ea&s;ed; the omentum was almo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated; what
<PB N="46" REF="43">remained of it was flaccid, and not indu|rated. The gall-bladder was con&s;iderably enlarged. On the le&s;t &s;ide of the thorax an effu&s;ion of water appeared, and the left lobe of the lungs afforded a tubercle of con&s;iderable magnitude. The heart was in a healthy &s;tate, and &s;o were the liver and &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Upon opening the throat a con&s;iderable tumor was found on the right &s;ide, im|mediately behind the <HI>ton&s;il,</HI> but it had no duct or pa&s;&s;age into the trachoea; the tumor contained about three ounces of foetid pus in its cavity. The child con|tinued &s;en&s;ible through the di&s;ea&s;e, but for the la&s;t fortnight never complained of any affection near the throat; or that the con&s;tant inclination to vomit all food or liquids, proceeded from irritation near the part di&s;ea&s;ed, and deglutition continued fa|miliar to the exit of the patient.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="44">
<P>About the &s;ame time I was attending another child with very &s;imilar &s;ymptoms of the angina trachoealis; the tumor of the neck was however much larger, and a &s;light dy&s;pnoea attended the child, which increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree one night as threatened &s;uffocation. On the next day the fever and dy&s;pnoea very &s;ud|denly dimini&s;hed; and, upon examining the throat internally, I ob&s;erved a quan|tity of pus di&s;charging from behind the <HI>ton&s;il</HI> of the &s;ame &s;ide of the neck, and this di&s;charge was augmented by gently pre&s;&s;ing the tumor externally. The child from this period gradually recovered.</P>
<P>Suppurations of this kind do not un|frequently accompany the angina maligna, or appear during its &s;ece&s;&s;ion, and continue &s;ometimes feveral days after the mucous membrane, which was fir&s;t affected in the angina, has recovered its natural &s;tate. In &s;uch in&s;tances, wherein a fatal tendency
<PB N="48" REF="45">is &s;u&s;pected, would it not be advi&s;eable to open the ab&s;ce&s;s that is formed, either by an inci&s;ion through the <HI>ton&s;il</HI> on the &s;ide affected, in imitation of the natural operation which occurred in the la&s;t in|&s;tance, or through the external integu|ments where the tumor points externally?</P>

<HEAD>On the extremes of the cold and hot regimen in the Sore-Throat, and other putrid Di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>SYDENHAM and MORTON practi&s;ed at one time in London; the former introduced the antiphlogi&s;tic, whil&s;t the latter continued the alexipharmic, regimen, in the &s;mall-pox as well as in different putrid affections; both perhaps with equal grounds and &s;ucce&s;s, as the practice of the one was mo&s;tly in the airy and court part of the town, where all di&s;ea&s;es are le&s;s malignant, and where the air is purer than it is in the clo&s;e part of the town, the city, full of gaols and impure air in which the other re&s;ided. An ob&s;ervation com|municated to me by Dr. Fothergill, who in&s;i&s;ts even now upon the hot regimen in
<PB N="50" REF="47">the malignant Sore-Throat, and has a&s;&s;ured me that notwith&s;tanding, in compliance with other phy&s;icians, he often tried the bark, yet never found it to an&s;wer the de&s;ired effect and was obliged to have re|cour&s;e again to his method of treating it with cordials, &amp;c. He ob&s;erved further, that even animal food &s;eemed not to be &s;o hurtful in this di&s;ea&s;e as is commonly thought; for he has taken notice that the patients have a particular longing for it, a call of unerring nature for &s;upport and &s;trength, and the Doctor thinks that acids are not &s;o beneficial, and &s;o great an|ti&s;ceptics, as is imagined: all which re|marks are certainly not theoretical, but founded on the &s;olid ba&s;is of a long and great practice and repeated ob&s;ervations; other practitioners however, in&s;i&s;t much upon the bark, and &s;ome even upon the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="48">
<P>It is true, that the indications of cure, according to the &s;tate of the patient, his &s;ituation, and the degree of malignancy of the di&s;ea&s;e and its &s;ymptoms, and not this or that regimen ought to be the guide of the arti&s;t. It is al&s;o undeniable, that even nature which is &s;o much talked of, cannot always be con&s;ulted as the true guide; for if we were to encourage na|ture in all her endeavours, &s;he would lead us often a&s;tray. In many ery&s;ipelous ca&s;es, and cutaneous eruptions, where nature en|deavours to throw out &s;ome peccant mat|ter upon the &s;kin, experience has thought not to a&s;&s;i&s;t her by &s;udorifics and warm medicines, but on the contrary to u&s;e ca|thartics. In the putrid Sore-Throat, and the confluent &s;mall-pox, the diarrhea often attending, mu&s;t be checked and moderated; and &s;o in many ca&s;es where nature mu&s;t be oppo&s;ed, as &s;he often acts not upon wi&s;e, but upon mechanical principles,
<PB N="52" REF="49">and it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the phy&s;ician to watch her only, and to let experience be his guide, in encouraging, moderating, and counteracting her efforts; it is only there|fore practice and not theory that enables the arti&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h between the criti|cal and &s;ymptomatical appearances of di&s;|ea&s;es. But when practitioners differ &s;o widely, even tho&s;e who practi&s;e in one and the &s;ame part of the town, and all appeal to facts, then I &s;hould think, theory might have &s;ome right to interfere, and bring in its verdict. I know that I am far from being equal to the ta&s;k; nor do I propo&s;e to decide in &s;o important and intricate a &s;ubject, but mean only to throw out &s;ome thoughts, and vehemently wi&s;h that the &s;ubject might be handled by my &s;uperiors both in knowledge and practice.</P>

Either of the extremes
<PB N="55" REF="52">will often increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e; for to confine the patient to his bed, heat his bo|dy with wine and cordials, and debar him of the air, mu&s;t certainly rarify the blood, relax the fibres, and increa&s;e the ten|dency to putrefaction, by increa&s;ing its too great principles, <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>moi&s;ture;</HI> as on the other hand, the too cold regimen will greatly contribute to le&s;&s;en the energy and motion of the &s;olids as well as of the fluids; and indeed many young and tender patients have peri&s;hed by cold, and been frozen to death, as it were, though others have often recovered under the colde&s;t regimen, yet this will prove no more than, that nature often cures di&s;ea&s;es in &s;pite of all mi&s;management of art.</P>
<P>Bleeding can &s;eldom be proper, for the &s;pontaneous na&s;al hoemorrhage, in the on|&s;et of both di&s;ea&s;es, the putrid Sore-Throat and the confluent &s;mall-pox, does not &s;eem
<PB N="56" REF="53">to be a hint of nature, in&s;inuating the nece&s;|&s;ity of emptying the ve&s;&s;els; but I &s;hould imagine its being merely &s;ymptomatical, owing to the loo&s;e texture of the blood, as is evident in ca&s;es of great malignancy, where the blood when drawn from a vein is &s;o watery and putrid, that it does not coagulate as u&s;ual, and might be divi|ded and moved any way with the &s;lighte&s;t touch of a feather, like water: the air con|fined in the blood encrea&s;es its ela&s;ticity is &s;et loo&s;e by the heat and fermentation of the fluids, and expands it&s;elf to &s;uch a degree, that it compa&s;&s;es a much greater room than u&s;ual, by which means it &s;tretch|es the fibres, and forces them to dilate beyond their natural dimen&s;ions, which, in the &s;maller capillary veins, occa&s;ions their bur&s;ting, and con&s;equently hoe|morrhages that are only &s;ymptomatical and indicate anti&s;ceptics, bracers, and free air, not bleeding; though the Arabian Phy&s;i|cians
<PB N="57" REF="54">have con&s;idered &s;uch di&s;charges as critical, and accordingly recommended the opening of the veins of the no&s;e in the be|ginning of the &s;mall-pox.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Et cum erit conveniens flebotomare venas narum i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> principis, e&s;t &s;atis utile. Rhazis d'wis. P. 209.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds of the diarr|haea, often attending the &s;mall-pox, as well as the putrid Sore-Throat, which is &s;ymptomatical, owing to the weakne&s;s and irritable &s;tate of the inte&s;tinal tube, and to the &s;timuli of the juices corrupted by the di&s;ea&s;e, but is not a critical di&s;charge, and therefore mu&s;t be moderated.</P>
<P>In all putrid di&s;ea&s;es, the principle of life and the nerves are chiefly concerned, in&s;omuch, that A&s;true thought, from examining the brains of tho&s;e who died in putrid fevers, that the &s;eat of the di&s;order lies originally in the brain it&s;elf; but if
<PB N="58" REF="55">even that alteration found he in the brain was only (as it mo&s;t probably &s;eemed to be) the effect and not the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, yet has no phy&s;ician ever di&s;puted that all putrid di&s;orders impart much to the eneaphlon and the nervous &s;y&s;tem, as is evident from the anxiety, dejection of &s;pirits, and pro&s;tration of &s;trength attend|ing the very on&s;et of putrid di&s;ea&s;es, clearly painted upon the eyes, and langui&s;hing and pityful countenance of the patient, and which, by it&s;elf, is &s;ufficient for a good ob&s;erver, to give him an exact idea of the di&s;ea&s;e and its degree of malignancy, with|out examining the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, and inquiring into all other &s;ymptoms. Whe|ther the nerves are primary or &s;econdary affected it matters not, the indications of cure, <HI>coeteris paribus,</HI> remain notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;ame, namely, to excite and rou&s;e the motion and energy of the nerves, and to brace the whole &s;y&s;tem, which may be
<PB N="59" REF="56">done either by applications acting with their &s;timulating quality, &s;uch as cordials, &s;pirits, and bli&s;ters, or by admini&s;tering &s;uch as are able to corroborate and com|pact, as it were, the loo&s;e and relaxed fibres, as are all the bitters, the bark, cold air, &amp;c. Either of which applications however are not attended without &s;ome di&s;advantages; for what concerns cordials and &s;timuli, it is well known, that although they won|derfully rou&s;e the &s;pirits, yet that great ex|ertion of the nerves is only a temporary tumult, as it were, which &s;oon cea&s;es, and leaves commonly behind it a great langour and relaxation of the fibres; as on the other hand &s;trengtheners and bitters alone, without the junction of &s;ome &s;timuli to exert the fibres into motion and action, will &s;ometimes have no effect at all, and often do great mi&s;chief; for I have el&s;e|where<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See the Author's E&s;&s;ay on the Blood.</NOTE> endeavoured to &s;hew, that all
<PB N="60" REF="57">medicines and application to living bodies can act only in degree and proportion to the reaction of the living fibres, and as long as the fibres are too weak to react, the effects of corroborating medicines will be ju&s;t, to make u&s;e of a familiar &s;imile, as a heap of coals thrown upon a little fire, which, in&s;tead of making it burn bri&s;ker, will extingui&s;h it entirely.</P>
<P>The immediate effects of the bark, when given to patients, who&s;e lungs are affected, in bringing on an in&s;upportable dy&s;pnoea, is a plain proof that it dimini&s;hes the irrita|tion of the fibres, and which I have &s;een often re&s;tored by admini&s;tering what are called expectorants and &s;timuli, e&s;pecially a &s;olution of gum ammoniac, with the &s;al. c. c. Seeing therefore, that there is &s;ome difficulty attending in each of the applica|tions and regimens &s;eparately, the mo&s;t ra|tional method, I &s;hould imagine, would be
<PB N="61" REF="58">to hit upon the medium of both regimens, and to join the bark along with &s;timulants and cordials, by which means, both inten|tions might be an&s;wered at once, namely, that of rou&s;ing the fibres, and exerting them to react, when at the &s;ame time they are coroborated and &s;trengthened by the bark; practice convinces the truth of this theory. That the bark doth often not an|&s;wer the expectations of the phy&s;ician, is mo&s;t probably owing to, either of its not being properly guarded with &s;timula|ting and warm medicines, or, which I be|lieve is too often the ca&s;e, to its not been given in full do&s;es, and not being per&s;eve|red in, though it mu&s;t be allowed, that whenever an anginal dy&s;pnoea is at hand, that the bark cannot be admini&s;tered with|out bringing on alarming &s;ymptoms. But might it not often &s;ucceed when joined with bal&s;amics and aromatics?</P>
