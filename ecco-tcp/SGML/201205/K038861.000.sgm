<HEAD>TO George Cheyne, <HI>M. D. FELLOW</HI> OF THE <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF any Thing in this World, be worthy of a wi&s;e Man's Care, it is Health; and as Mankind, cannot &s;uf|ficiently te&s;tify their Gratitude to tho&s;e, who labour in the Practice
<PB N="2" REF="5">of healing Di&s;ea&s;es, with Diligence, Candour, and Judgment; &s;o on the other hand, they cannot enough dete&s;t tho&s;e who &s;et up for the <HI>Art of Healing,</HI> without any other Qua|lification, but their <HI>Diploma,</HI> to Re|commend them; and having nothing in their view, but making or mend|ing their Fortunes, neglect that Knowledge, which is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to make their Practice Ho|nourable and Succe&s;sful.</P>
<P>They who write Well and Ill, on the Subject of Health, ought in like-manner, to be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to one another, and as their Labours tend to the Pre&s;ervation or Preju|dice of Health, &s;o ought they to become the Objects of our Favour, or Contempt.</P>
<P>As all Mankind, are more or le&s;s frail, they therefore ought to bear a great deal from one anothers Folly; and the trade of Scribling, among the re&s;t of Men's folly's, may be &s;o far indulged, as not to be cen&s;ured, &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="6">long as it continues harmele&s;s and innocent; but as &s;oon as it cea&s;es to be &s;o, it is every rea&s;onable Man's duty, to endeavour to &s;top its tor|rent, and divert as much as po&s;&s;ibly he can, the Mi&s;chief it threatens.</P>
<P>If a Man imagines he can oblige the World, by communicating &s;ome thing u&s;eful; as he ought by no means to &s;uppre&s;s it, &s;o what he advances, ought to be attended with the Rea&s;ons that led him into his Opinion; and the&s;e &s;hou'd be of|fered to the Con&s;ideration of &s;uch only, who&s;e application in that way to which they tend, hath made them Judges of their Sufficiency; and then if his Arguments &s;hou'd prove too weak, to &s;upport his Oppinion, no other harm will en&s;ue, but his Lo&s;s of Labour, and that &s;hare of Prai&s;e, which probably he might expect as the Reward of it.</P>
<P>But when a <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> &s;hall pre|&s;ume, to lay down <HI>Practical Rules,</HI> to all Mankind without Di&s;tinction,
<PB N="4" REF="7">for the Pre&s;ervation of Health; and if the&s;e Rules &s;hou'd prove pernicious and de&s;tructive to it, People will be apt to imagine, that he puts him&s;elf upon a Level with the&s;e <HI>Savages</HI> on the Sea-coa&s;t, who &s;et out fal&s;e Lights, to invite di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Mariners</HI> to their de&s;truction; that they may reap the Benefit of the Ship-wreck.</P>
<P>You be&s;t know SIR, what were the Motives, that prompted you to publi&s;h your <HI>E&s;&s;ay of Health and long Life,</HI> as you call it; but I doubt, many will have Rea&s;on to wi&s;h it had never appear'd; it is now almo&s;t in every bodys hand, and that &s;eeming &s;elf-deniedne&s;s in your Preface, that Air of <HI>Piety</HI> that you put on, in almo&s;t every other Period, will per&s;wade many to be|lieve, &s;o good a Man, wou'd never publi&s;h a Book to pamper his Vani|ty, and wou'd never pretend to the Knowledge of any thing he was an ab&s;olute Stranger to; the&s;e Con|&s;iderations, will, I am affraid weigh with many to their Di&s;truction.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>I intend by this to &s;how, that e|very Attempt of this kind mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, if not pernicious, by en|couraging People to tamper with their Con&s;titutions, which they cannot po&s;&s;ibly regulate by any General Rules. And if your Per|formance proves, that your know|ledge of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> is not quite &s;o exten&s;ive as perhaps it ought to be; you mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s if I point out a few of tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages, from whence that unhappy Conclu&s;ion naturaly flows. If the Rea&s;ons I &s;hall offer to this purpo&s;e, are not &s;ufficient to make it appear, they cannot hurt you; but on the Contrary, if they happen to be ju&s;t and convincing, no good Man will blame me for undeceiving People, in what regards a thing, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to their Well-being as Health.</P>
<P>I have no Inclination to trace you thro' every thing that I think wrong in this Performance, becau&s;e, be&s;ide the irk&s;ome Employment of finding
<PB N="6" REF="9">fault, that wou'd oblige me to write a Book at lea&s;t as large as yours. I &s;hall endeavour therefore, to be as &s;hort as the Subject will allow me.</P>
<P>It is a common Saying, as you ob&s;erve, that a Man pa&s;t Forty, is either a Fool, or a Phy&s;ician; and if it means any thing, it only im|plys, that by &s;o long experience, a Man that is not a Fool, will know what things have be&s;t agreed with him; and his Rea&s;on will direct him to continue the U&s;e of them, till &s;ome alteration in his Con&s;titution makes them hurtful; and when the happens, he will find there is &s;ome|thing el&s;e required to make a Man a Phy&s;ician, be&s;ides living forty Years in the World; for be&s;ide Di&s;ea&s;es, old Age will alter a Man's Con&s;titution, and bring on Symp|toms, which he could have no expe|rience of, when le&s;s advanced in Years. Of what u&s;e then, can his former Experience be to him, in Cir|cum&s;tances he never was in before?</P>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that by forty Years Experience, a Man may have di&s;cover'd the proper Method he &s;hou'd follow, through all the dif|ferent Stages and Accidents of Life, to pre&s;erve his Health, and prolong his Days; yet this Method will only be applicable to him&s;elf, and &s;uch Con&s;titutions as exactly re&s;emble his own, in every Circum&s;tance; and &s;uch another, perhaps will not be to be found among all the re&s;t of Man|kind.</P>
<P>You tell us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Page 4.</NOTE> <Q>"The Reflection is not more common than ju&s;t, that he who lives Phy&s;icaly lives Mi&s;erably, the truth is too great a nicety and exactne&s;s about e|very minute Circum&s;tance that may impare our Health, is &s;uch a Yoke and Slavery, as no Man of a free and generous Spirit wou'd &s;ubmit to; 'tis as the <HI>Poet</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, to dye for fear of dying."</Q></P>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<P>If this had been the Effect of any previous Reflection, or if you had believ'd it, <HI>Charity</HI> inclines me to think, that you wou'd not have been &s;o indu&s;trious to contradict it, as appears from your &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Rules of Health;</HI> (as you are plea&s;ed to call them,) but have left Mankind to act for the Benefit of their Health, as Rea&s;on and Experience &s;hould dictate to them; and when they are Indi&s;pos'd, to call in tho&s;e Aids that are proper to give them Relief; I mean &s;uch Phy&s;icians, who&s;e Skill in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> and the <HI>Ma|teria Medica,</HI> hath render'd them capable to judge of the Nature of a Di&s;temper, and to apply the pro|per Means to remove it. I am &s;ure every rea&s;onable Man is a better Judge of what he ought to do, for the Benefit of his Health, than any Phy&s;ican can be, who is not inti|mately acquainted with all the Cir|cum&s;tances of his Con&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<P>When a Man has acquired a com|petent Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oe|conomy,</HI> and of the Power and Effi|cacy of the&s;e Medicines, proper to re&s;tore and pre&s;erve Health, to &s;uch a Man, I believe it is po&s;&s;ible to lay down &s;uch general Rules, and Di|rections, as may enable him to prac|tice the <HI>Art of healing,</HI> with &s;ucce&s;s and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But to pretend to direct Men ig|norant of the&s;e things, how to go|vern them&s;elves, to pre&s;erve or re|&s;tore their Health, is equally rea&s;o|nable, as if one &s;hould give Direct|ions to a blind Man, to go a long Journey by him&s;elf, thro' ways that he never cou'd po&s;&s;ibly have any <HI>Idea</HI> of, and where every &s;tep out of the way wou'd endanger if not de&s;troy his Life. For how &s;hall Men be able to adju&s;t either the Kind or Quantity of Diet or Medicine, that may be nece&s;&s;ary, to Con&s;titutions they are Strangers to? How &s;hall they be able to judge for them&s;elves, of
<PB N="10" REF="13">that Exerci&s;e, and Air, that is proper for them, when they are unacquaint|ed with the Nature of tho&s;e Symp|toms, that can only enable them to di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>You will perhaps &s;ay, that you have acquainted them with the&s;e Symptoms to which your Directions are &s;uitable; but may not a Per&s;on be afflicted with any Symptoms you can mention, and at the &s;ame time have others, which wou'd make the Method that might be proper to re|move &s;uch Symptoms, were they alone, de&s;tructive to the Patient, now they are complicated with o|thers, which you cou'd not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>What then mu&s;t become of that Per&s;on, who having the&s;e Symp|toms you mention, follows your Advice, and who&s;e want of Know|ledge will make him di&s;regard tho&s;e other Symptoms that will make your pre&s;cription pernicious?</P>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<P>Many Attempts have been made to lay down general Rules, for Mankind without di&s;tinction, to pre|&s;erve their Health and prolong their Lives; but the&s;e Productions never obtain'd the End they aim'd at; be|cause the Con&s;titutions and Habits of Mens bodies differ &s;o much from one another, that any general Rule laid down to any number of Men for this Purpo&s;e, mu&s;t be de&s;truct|ive, at lea&s;t to the greate&s;t Part of them, if they all comply with it.</P>
<P>For if every Man, was exactly to pur&s;ue that method to <HI>Health and long Life,</HI> that is proper for him to follow, perhaps we &s;hould not find two in ten thou&s;and, exactly pur&s;u|ing the &s;ame Cour&s;e, though their End wou'd be all the &s;ame; &s;o that any general Rule enioyn'd to the&s;e ten thou&s;and, wou'd but at be&s;t be u&s;eful to two, and hurtful or de|&s;tructive to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It very rarely, or never happens, that Di&s;ea&s;es, even of the &s;ame De|nomination,
<PB N="12" REF="15">ever affected two Per|&s;ons, in the &s;ame manner, in every Symptom, and the Method of Cure ought always to vary with the Symp|toms. How then can you tell a Man, after what manner he &s;hou'd govern him&s;elf in a Di&s;order, when you cannot po&s;&s;ibly know, in what man|ner he is to be affected with it? Or tell how a Con&s;titution &s;hou'd be be regulated, which you are altoge|ther a Stranger to? And the&s;e va|letudinary crazy Con&s;tutions, that you addre&s;s your &s;elf to, actually labour under Di&s;tempers, or they wou'd not be &s;o; and perhaps there are not two &s;uch in all <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Complaints, and Con&s;titu|tions don't differ in many Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>So infinite is the variety of Di&s;|ea&s;es and Con&s;titutions, that the be&s;t Phy&s;ician in the World, can only determine, for the&s;e he is inti|mately acquainted with, and who&s;e Symptoms he him&s;elf hath examin'd,
<PB N="13" REF="16">and cannot with any &s;afety, de|pend upon any thing, but the con|viction of his own Sen&s;es, to regu|late his Practice by.</P>
<P>What then mu&s;t the Complexion of your Merit be, who pretending to point out the way to <HI>Health and long Life,</HI> lay down Rules for Man|kind to follow, which perhaps will never be u&s;eful to any, and may be hurtful and de&s;tructive to all, who regard your Advice? and the great|er your Reputation as a Phy&s;ician, the wor&s;e will be the Con&s;equences, and con&s;equently the greater your Guilt.</P>
<P>Your Rules for Health, are all of them, either &s;uch as have been known to all Mankind, &s;ince the World began; or mi&s;taken Notions, founded upon no Principles that ever rea&s;on dictated.</P>
<P>When, or by whom was it ever denied, or even &s;o much as doubted by the Thinking-Part of Mankind, (and you tell us, you don't write
<PB N="14" REF="17">to the In&s;en&s;ible) that Eating and Drinking to exce&s;s, were de&s;truct|ive to Health; but then it mu&s;t be own'd, that no Body before you, ever pre&s;umed to determine the Quantity of Meat and Drink, that a Man &s;hould take, and pre&s;cribed that quantity to every Body, with|out di&s;tinction; this is indeed in|tirely New, and I hope in Charity to the re&s;t of Mankind, that you are the only Man in being, capable of laying down &s;uch a Rule.</P>
<P>That a very great regard ought to be had to the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Air,</HI> to re&s;tore and pre&s;erve Health, is a greater Truth than you &s;eem to be aware of; but then, it is as true, that no one Con&s;titution of <HI>Air,</HI> will agree with every habit of Body; and a Phy&s;ician mu&s;t be intimately acquainted with a Man's Con&s;titu|tion, before he can pre&s;cribe a pro|per Temperament of <HI>Air</HI> for him to live in.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<P>You affirm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pag. 46.</NOTE> <Q>"That you have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved good Effects from leaving off &s;uddenly great quantities of Wine and Fle&s;h|meats too, by tho&s;e long accu&s;t|omed to both."</Q> I will not here di&s;pute what you &s;ay is Fact; but I &s;hall beg leave to enquire a little into the Arguments you give us, to &s;upport the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of this A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>You tell us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Page 45.</NOTE> <Q>"That nothing is more rediculous than the common Plea for continuing in drinking on large quantities of &s;pirituous Liquours, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e they have been ac|cu&s;tom'd &s;o to do, and they think it dangerous to leave it off of a &s;udden, it were as rea&s;onable for him that is fallen into the Fire or Water to lie there, becau&s;e of the Danger of removing him &s;uddenly."</Q> But this Argument of yours is to no Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s you can prove, that a Per&s;everance, in that Life a Man has been accu&s;t|omed
<PB N="16" REF="19">to, will as &s;uddenly de&s;troy his Life, as lying in the Fire or Wa|ter will; and your other Argument is,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Page 45.</NOTE> <Q>"That no Man was ever a|fraid to forbear &s;trong Liquours in an acute Di&s;temper, what quantity &s;oever he might have drank in his Health."</Q></P>
<P>Here SIR, you mu&s;t give me leave to inform you, that Di&s;ea&s;es and Health, are Circum&s;tances, directly oppo&s;ite to one another, and what may be proper and fit to be done in the one, may by no means be &s;afe, or convenient in the other.</P>
<P><HI>e. g.</HI> In a continued Fever, where Ob&s;tructions prevail in mo&s;t of the <HI>Capillary Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> and the u&s;ual di&s;|charges from the Body, by in&s;en&s;i|ble Per&s;piration, <HI>&amp;c</HI> Being ob|&s;tructed the larger and pa&s;&s;able Ve&s;|&s;els, to which the circulating Fluid is confin'd, are for that rea&s;on over|charg'd, and to give a Per&s;on in this Ca&s;e, even that kind, and quantity of meat and drink, that wou'd be
<PB N="17" REF="20">nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;tate of Health to pre|&s;erve it, wou'd increa&s;e the Di&s;tem|per, by increa&s;ing the quantity of Fluid, in the pa&s;&s;able or pervious Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e we call acute Ca&s;es, the circulating Fluid is not only con|fined to a &s;maller number of Ve&s;&s;els, but there being a Check put to the u&s;ual Expence and Di&s;charge from it, by the &s;everal <HI>Emunctories</HI> of the Body, which made the former &s;up|ply from eating and drinking in a State of health u&s;eful: <HI>Temperance</HI> therefore, whatever hath been a Man's way of living, is not only &s;afe, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, till the&s;e Ob|&s;tructions which are the Di&s;ea&s;e, be removed; and the &s;everal <HI>Excretory's</HI> are again qualified, to throw off the Superfluities, from the Ma&s;s of Blood. Care mu&s;t likewi&s;e be taken in the&s;e Ca&s;es, to dilute the Blood, and re|lax the Fibres; and the&s;e Medicines which can effect this, will di&s;&s;olve the Union of the combin'd Particles,
<PB N="18" REF="21">that ob&s;tructed the <HI>Capillary's,</HI> and &s;tood in the Way of the circulating Fluid, or Extra-corporeal Secretions.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e diluteing Medicines, which are convenient in this Ca&s;e, were given to one, where the Quan|tity of Secretions, are to the Quan|tity of Fluid in the Body, in that ju&s;t Proportion, that is nece&s;&s;ary to Health; they wou'd increa&s;e the Secretions, de&s;troy that nece&s;&s;ary Proportion, and beget Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>And if a Man in a good State of Health, who has accu&s;tom'd him&s;elf to eat and drink plentifully, &s;hou'd &s;uddenly leave of that Method, and betake him&s;elf to a &s;pare Diet all at once; the <HI>Excretory's</HI> which throw of the Extra-corporeal Secretions, being large enough to carry off the Refu&s;e of his Extravagance, would upon &s;o &s;udden a Change, throw off more than &s;uch an ab&s;tenious-diet cou'd &s;pare, and leave too little in the Ve&s;&s;els, to &s;upport the Circula|tion, with that velocity that is nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="19" REF="22">to Health, for that the Blood may be propelled with that degree of ve|locity, that is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Health, the Ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t all be fill'd in &s;uch a manner, as the Impul&s;e of the Fluid, and the Re-action of the Ve&s;&s;els, may be adju&s;ted to this ne|ce&s;&s;ary velocity; more or le&s;s will beget a Di&s;ea&s;e: And the Blood|ve&s;&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Being &s;uddenly drain'd, and depriv'd of their u&s;ual &s;upply, the pre&s;&s;ure of the Fluid again&s;t them will decrea&s;e with the Quantity of it; and the Impul&s;e of the Fluid, and the Re-action of the Ve&s;&s;els be|ing equal, &s;uch a Diminution, from a Con&s;titution that is not labouring under an acute Di&s;temper, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily le&s;&s;en the Velocity of the Fluid proportionaly.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, that the &s;ud|den Change which you recommend, wou'd make &s;uch a Di&s;proportion between the Quantity of Fluid, and the Dimen&s;ions of the Ve&s;&s;els, as wou'd render the Circulation very
<PB N="20" REF="23">languid; and this &s;low motion of the Fluid, wou'd give its Parts an Opportunity of combineing, and for|ming Bodies too gro&s;s, to pa&s;s thro' the more minute <HI>Capillary</HI>'s, and the Ob&s;tructions that wou'd en&s;ue from thence, wou'd con&s;equently be the Fountain of many grievous Di&s;tem|pers. The ill Con&s;equences of &s;uch &s;udden Changes, have been taken Notice of, by every Judicious Ob|&s;erver in Phy&s;ick, &s;ince <HI>Hippocrates;</HI> and as many of them, as have wrote upon this Subject, have faithfully caution'd Mankind again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I have already given my Rea&s;ons, why I think it dangerous to pre|&s;cribe either Diet, or Medicine at random. And now give me leave to point at &s;ome things, which ap|pear to me in a very odd Light. In the Directions you have given to re|gulate the quantity of Food.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 39.</NOTE> <Q>"Since our Ap|petites are deceitful, and Weight and Mea&s;ure trouble&s;ome and

<P>Every thinking Man, I believe is an Enemy to Debauching in &s;trong Liquours, but I cannot be of your Opinion, when you recommend and prefer &s;mall Wines to the &s;tronger Kind.

<PB N="23" REF="26">but becau&s;e &s;uch Wines, being much le&s;s Subject to Putrefaction than the &s;maller Kind, People will have a much better Chance, for drinking that which is Good.

<P>Doctor <HI>James Keill,</HI> in his E&s;&s;ays upon the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> com|puted the force of the Heart, equal to a Weight of 5 Ounces only; and that the velocity of the Blood at the Heart, to that in the minute <HI>Capillary</HI>'s (and he did not de&s;cend &s;o far as the <HI>Excretory</HI>'s of in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration) was as 5.233 to 1.

<P>I confe&s;s Dr. <HI>Keill</HI> was mi&s;taken in this Calculation; for if the force, which propells the <HI>Animal</HI> Fluids, was &s;o much inferiour to the Pre&s;|&s;ure of the <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> the Circu|lation cou'd not be carried on, and Con&s;equently no <HI>Animal</HI> cou'd ex|i&s;t in the Air we live in; for that Rea&s;on, I &s;hall not pre&s;s this Doct|rine as an Argument again&s;t you; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary here, to deter|mine, how much you are mi&s;taken in the other Extream.</P>
<P>But the true Cau&s;e, why People who&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are well filled with good Nouri&s;hment, from rich Food, and generous Wines, are not apt to catch Cold, or be tainted with infectious Di&s;tempers, is becau&s;e, when the Ve&s;&s;els are all thus filled,
<PB N="27" REF="30">the <HI>Excretory</HI>'s, upon the Surface of the Body, are charged in proportion; and being &s;well'd with the Matter of Per&s;piration, they pre&s;s again&s;t, and &s;hut up the&s;e Orrifices, which convey the Air, or any thing el&s;e from the Surface of our Bodies, to our Ma&s;s of Blood; and when the Ve&s;&s;els are not filled as they ought to be, from Sickne&s;s, or any other Cau&s;e, the <HI>Excretory</HI>'s of Per&s;pira|tion are proportionaly empty, and con&s;equently can't pre&s;s upon the&s;e Orrifices, but will leave them open to receive the Air, or any kind of Fluid, that may happen to be ap|plied to the Skin of &s;uch a Per&s;on.

<P>Now I wou'd fain ask you, if all the People in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> are afflicted with this Di&s;temper, and if it cuts them off in a few Days, how could ever that Place be Inhabited?

<P>And I am inform'd by a Gentle|man of good Under&s;tanding, and great Integrity, who lived upwards of 30 Years in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and but lately came from it; that the Di&s;ea&s;e called the dry Belly-Ach, which is &s;o peculiar to that Country, attacks the Women as well as the Men; and that the Women there, are particularly Remarkable for their Temperance, and ab&s;tinence from &s;trong Liquors; and that many of both Sexes, who never ta&s;ted <HI>Punch,</HI> or indulg'd in any &s;trong Liquor in their Lives, are afflcted with this Di&s;temper; if this be true, and I have no rea&s;on to doubt my Infor|mation, then this Di&s;temper mu&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="39">have &s;ome other Source than <HI>Punch.</HI></P>
<P>And if the <HI>Bath</HI> be the only Cure for this Di&s;temper, as you boldly affirm it is; how comes it to pa&s;s, that &s;o many are cured of it in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies?</HI> And tho' the meaning of your recommending the <HI>Bath,</HI> and of your Encomiums upon the <HI>Water,</HI> and other Conveniencies of that Place, upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, is by no means My&s;terious; yet you have ra&s;hly &s;train'd that Point too far in this Place, and it will never contribute to the End for which I believe you de&s;ign'd it; for pro|bably you never can have any Pa|tients, under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, but from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> who at the &s;ame time they read your Re|commendation of the <HI>Bath,</HI> to Save and Cure them, they will find your Mi&s;take, in &s;aying it is the only Re|medy; &s;ince they all know, that many more are cured of it at Home, than ever came to the <HI>Bath</HI> to find Relief; and that going to a colder
<PB N="37" REF="40">Climate, never fails to produce a Cure of this Di&s;temper, without taking any other Remedy.</P>
<P>And this Di&s;ea&s;e, is &s;o far from always cutting them off in a few Days, that they who live &s;oberly when they are &s;o afflicted, generally recover in a very little Time; and it will hold tho&s;e, who continue the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong Liquors many Months, nay Years, before they are either kill'd by it, or cured of it. The&s;e things, which every Body in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> know to be true, will nece&s;&s;arily make them conclude, that you know nothing of the Na|ture of this Di&s;temper. And if this be true, your telling them that the <HI>Bath</HI> is their only Remedy, will hardly bring them there to become your Patients.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, with|out reflecting upon the good Sen&s;e of the&s;e People, that they would indulge them&s;elves in a Liquor &s;o pernicious to them, as you think

<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e that you a&s;cribe to <HI>Punch,</HI> is I am told, the Effect of catching cold in that Country, which the &s;ober People carefully guard a|gain&s;t; but tho&s;e who u&s;e to intoxi|cate them&s;elves with &s;trong Liquors, often neglect the proper Means to prevent taking cold, by &s;leeping &s;ometimes in the open Air, or not taking the proper Care to avoid this ill, by Means that are nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed within Doors. For tho' a Man is le&s;s apt to catch cold, when his Ve&s;&s;els are all turg'd with the Liquor that hath made him drunk; yet after &s;ome time, when the &s;everal <HI>Emunctory</HI>'s of the Body, have di&s;|charged the &s;uperfluous Fluid from the Ve&s;&s;els, they will become more lank, and the Pores of the Skin will be more open, to admitt any nox|ious Steams that may be in the Air, than they were before; and there|fore,
<PB N="39" REF="42">a more than common Care, is requi&s;ite to prevent a Man's taking cold in this State. And if a Man catches cold there, after being drunk, he will be &s;eized with this Di&s;tem|per, whatever Liquor he debauch'd in. Indeed as all the Ingredients of <HI>Ruin-Punch,</HI> are the Product of that Country, they are con&s;equently to he purchas'd very cheap, and for this Rea&s;on the poorer &s;ort of Peo|ple, and the Sailors that go thither (who are the Bulk of tho&s;e who delight in drinking to Exce&s;s) often get the dry Belly-Ach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By catching cold, after being drunk with <HI>Punch.</HI> But &s;ince <HI>Punch</HI> is no more acce&s;&s;ary to this Di&s;temper, than any other &s;trong Liquor, that a Man debauches in, and &s;ince &s;o|ber Per&s;ons who never ta&s;ted <HI>Punch,</HI> are &s;ubject to this Di&s;temper, I think it very unrea&s;onable, to attri|bute this Mi&s;chief wholy to <HI>Punch.</HI></P>

<PB N="42" REF="45">Tubes, whereas the Arteries and Veins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which evidently con|tain Fluid are <HI>Conical,</HI> and Nature being uniform in her Operations, therefore you conclude, that the Nerves contain no Fluid.</P>
<P>The Arteries by dividing into Branches, mu&s;t grow gradually nar|rower, and for that Rea&s;on are <HI>Con|ical;</HI> and the Nerves are <HI>Cylinders</HI> becau&s;e they do not communicate with one another, but run on in &s;e|parate Canal's, from their Origines to their Extremities.</P>
<P><HI>And the Wi&s;dom of our Creator is &s;ignaly manife&s;ted in contriveing the Structure of the Nerves, different from that of all the other Ve&s;&s;els in the</HI> Ani|mal <HI>Body.

<PB N="43" REF="46">without communicating their additio|nal Fluid, or Impul&s;e, to any of the other Nerves; which cou'd not happen, if their Structure was like that of the Arteries: For if the Nerves that &s;erve in bending and extending of a Limb, were Branches from a common Trunk, with which they had a Communication, any impul&s;e at the Trunk, would be propagated equally to all the Branches, the Benders and Extenders.

<P>But you &s;eem to be of another Opinion, and tell us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Page 163</NOTE> <Q>"That Beauty or Perfection gives plea|&s;ure to both Parts of the Com|pound".</Q> That is to the <HI>Mind</HI> and its Organs; I thought there had not been a thinking Man in Being, who did not know, that the Organs of the Body were compo&s;ed of meer Matter, and con&s;equently incapable of any Sen&s;ation; and that Knowledge and Perception, can only exi&s;t in the <HI>Mind,</HI> and is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Cha|racter of it.</P>
<P>I have a better Opinion of you, than to believe you mean, what I think this Pa&s;&s;age implys; for &s;ince Knowledge and Perception, are the&s;e e&s;&s;ential Quallities of the Soul, which denote its exi&s;tence; and &s;ince all things which are endued with the &s;ame Properties, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be of the &s;ame Species and Nature; why &s;hou'd we then believe the Soul
<PB N="67" REF="70">immortal, if the&s;e Properties from whence we derive our belief of its Immortallity, are common to the Body which evidently peri&s;hes? Nor does the Ab&s;urdity of this No|tion of yours end here, for when we con&s;ider it, with what you call the 4th <HI>Prop.</HI> of this Di&s;&s;ertation, we will find them amount to the mo&s;t hideous <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> that ever was imagin'd; equally &s;hocking and repugnant to Rea&s;on: Your Words are the&s;e,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">Page 149</NOTE> <Q>"As in Bodies there is a Principle of <HI>Gravity</HI> or <HI>Attract|ion,</HI> whereby, <HI>in vacuo,</HI> they tend to one another, and wou'd unite according to certain <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Li|mitations</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature:</HI> So there is an <HI>Analo|gous Principle</HI> in <HI>Spirits,</HI> whereby they wou'd as certainly, in their proper vacuity, be <HI>attracted</HI> by, <HI>tend</HI> to, and <HI>unite</HI> with one ano|ther; and their fir&s;t <HI>Author, Cen|tre,</HI> and the <HI>Rock out of which they were hewn</HI> (to u&s;e a Scripture
