<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON SOME OF THE ARTICLES OF DIET AND REGIMEN, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t he obvious to every per&s;on conver&s;ant in the &s;cience of medicine, that the dietetic part of it, or that which re&s;pects our regimen and way of life, has not been improved in equal pro|portion
<PB N="2" REF="4">with that which regards the ad|mini&s;tration of medicines. This was ob&s;erved &s;everal years ago by an expe|rienced and learned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Huxham. Vide his E&s;&s;ay on Fevers.</NOTE> practitioner, and I believe there is no rea&s;on to think that the ca&s;e is altered &s;ince his time. This inattention has ari&s;en from &s;everal cau&s;es. Few of the modern writers on the Materia Medica con&s;ider &s;ub&s;tances merely nutritive, or &s;uch as are u&s;ed in diet, however they may differ from each other in their nature, as coming within their &s;phere, &s;o that this &s;ubject is &s;carcely directly treated of under any of the branches into which the &s;tudy of medicine is at pre&s;ent divided. Nutri|tion indeed it&s;elf, and the &s;ub&s;tances that conduce to it, are con&s;idered as a part of phy&s;iology; but this is more with reference to the mode of its being performed, and the effects of the &s;ub|&s;tances
<PB N="3" REF="5">employed in it upon a healthy body, than with re&s;pect to the proper choice of them in various di&s;orders. Few likewi&s;e of the modern practical writers are very explicit on this &s;ubject, and their directions relative to it are more commonly drawn from rea&s;oning and theory, or the authority of former writers, than any actual experience of the effects of the &s;ub&s;tances recom|mended or forbidden. In re&s;pect of attention to this point, we are far inferior to the ancients.</P>
<P>Hippocrates hardly de&s;cribes a di&s;|ea&s;e without recommending a regimen of life adapted to its cure; and this circum&s;tance, which in reality is greatly to his credit, has been, I am per&s;uaded, one of the grounds of the objections made again&s;t his practice, as being in many ca&s;es frivolous and inef|ficacious,
<PB N="4" REF="6">which would have been in a great mea&s;ure obviated, had many of the &s;ub&s;tances he advi&s;es been con&s;ider|ed as articles of diet rather than of me|dicine.</P>
<P>His commentator Galen, and his follower Cel&s;us, have both imitated his example in this re&s;pect, as there is &s;carce a di&s;order treated of by them, wherein there is not a very diffu&s;e and particu|lar account of the regimen, and way of life which they conceive to be be&s;t &s;uited to its cure.</P>
<P>Aretaeus likewi&s;e, perhaps the mo&s;t judicious of any of the ancient writers, has laid &s;o much &s;tre&s;s on this article in many di&s;orders, that he has declared the whole of the cure depends on an attention to the regulation of the diet and way of life; and this not in chro|nical
<PB N="5" REF="7">cau&s;es only, but in acute ones al&s;o.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds good with re&s;pect to the other mo&s;t approv|ed writers of antiquity on the &s;ubject of medicine, and I am apt to think that the di&s;regard of tho&s;e which has been of late &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly inculcated by &s;e|veral of the modern profe&s;&s;ors of that &s;cience, and which &s;ucceeded to the ex|travagant veneration formerly paid to them, has dimini&s;hed the attention of the faculty to this branch; and in that re&s;pect, as well as many others, has been of no &s;ervice to medicine, either as a &s;cience or a practical art. Another circum&s;tance &s;eemingly trivial, that has cau&s;ed this part of medicine to be le&s;s con&s;idered, is, that the directions for the medicines only are accu&s;tomed to be given in writing; whereas tho&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="8">which regard diet and regimen, are ge|nerally in ca&s;es which require medical attendance, only delivered verbally, which has in &s;ome mea&s;ure cau&s;ed them to be le&s;s attended to, and even held as inferior in their nature and con&s;equence to tho&s;e which concern the apothecary.</P>
<P>The difficulty likewi&s;e of procuring a compliance with rules of regimen and diet, has al&s;o proved a great ob&s;ta|cle to any improvement that might have been produced by practice and ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>The&s;e cau&s;es, among many others, have contributed to produce that rotin of practice &s;o con&s;picuous in the pre|&s;ent age with regard to this circum|&s;tance. To correct this in general, and lay down rules of diet and regimen adapted to the various di&s;orders incident
<PB N="7" REF="9">to human life, would be a highly u&s;eful, though extremely arduous undertaking. Such a one, however, would much ex|ceed the limits of the pre&s;ent pamphlet, which is not meant to treat of the &s;ub|ject in general, but to endeavour to amend &s;ome errors into which many practitioners have fallen, from indi&s;cri|minately following great names in the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And here I would ob&s;erve, that in every ca&s;e wherein we wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the &s;trength as entire as po&s;&s;ible, as in mo&s;t chronical complaints, we &s;hould be extremely cautious in pre&s;cribing a rigid regimen with re&s;pect to diet, e&s;pecially if &s;uch regimen is intended to be long continued.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance de&s;erves particular attention on &s;everal accounts. Few per|&s;ons,
<PB N="8" REF="10">even of the be&s;t health, can, with|out di&s;gu&s;t, bear to be confined to a peculiar food or way of living for any length of time (which is a &s;trong argu|ment that variety of food is natural to mankind); and if &s;o, the debilitated &s;tomach of Valetudinarians cannot be expected to be le&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippocrates cautions again&s;t this very properly in chronic di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;Quapropter hoc admoneo ut dicentibus quidem attendant, facientibus autem in|cumbant &amp; contractam victus rationem non diu pre&s;cribant. Aegrotantis enim diuturnam, concu|pi&s;centiam erigit indulgentia etlam in morbo diu|turnoa. &mdash;Hippocrates Praeceptiones, Cap. XI.</NOTE> affected.</P>
<P>Now in the human body the ta&s;te &s;eems to be the index or &s;ign of the &s;ub|&s;tance being agreeable to the &s;tomach, or fit for dige&s;tion; at least it may be &s;aid that things di&s;agreeable to the pa|late &s;eldom dige&s;t well, or contribute
<PB N="9" REF="11">towards the nouri&s;hment of the body; a circum&s;tance of the mo&s;t e&s;pecial con|cern. A rigid regimen of diet I have al&s;o ob&s;erved frequently to have an ill effect on the &s;pirits, by continually reminding the patients of their valetudinary &s;tate, by a compari&s;on of their &s;ituation with that of others who enjoy greater liberty in the&s;e re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Another ill effect of a regimen of diet is, that it tends to dimini&s;h the quantity of food taken in, which conduces greatly to weaken the body, not only on account of the defect of quantity of nouri&s;hment, though that is of no &s;mall importance, but al&s;o by other means.</P>
<P>The filling of the &s;tomach at &s;tated intervals to a certain degree with food, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the health of the
<PB N="10" REF="12">human frame, not on account only of the nouri&s;hment it &s;upplies, but al&s;o of the ten&s;ion thereby produced on the fibres of the &s;tomach, which is from thence communicated to the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;erves al&s;o to excite &s;uch a degree of reaction in the &s;tomach it&s;elf, and ali|mentary canal, as to enable it to dige&s;t the food, and di&s;tribute the nouri&s;h|ment properly through the Sy&s;tem. It is therefore probable then, that when a quantity of the food is &s;ub&s;tracted, the body &s;uffers not only from defect of nu|triment, but al&s;o from want of its accu&s;|tomed &s;timulus and firmne&s;s of fibre, which were u&s;ed to be imparted to it at certain periods.</P>
<P>It is probable al&s;o, that when the food is taken in an under proportion, that for the rea&s;ons above given, it would neither be it&s;elf &s;o well dige&s;ted,
<PB N="11" REF="13">nor the chyle it affords &s;o perfectly a&s;|&s;imilated. A healthy &s;tomach is indeed enabled to accommodate it&s;elf without much inconvenience to con&s;iderable va|rieties in this re&s;pect, but where its powers are debilitated, the &s;malle&s;t dif|ference may be of the utmo&s;t impor|tance.</P>
<P>I imagine al&s;o, that a diminution of the quantity of food has another effect, which is a very common attendant on an impaired dige&s;tion, viz. that of in|ducing a co&s;tive habit. When the re|action of the &s;tomach is incon&s;iderable, little ten&s;ion is communicated to the inte&s;tines, and of con&s;equence their propul&s;ive power is much weakened, e&s;pecially as the bulk of the food is too &s;mall to prove any con&s;iderable &s;timu|lar to the bowels them&s;elves.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances duly con&s;idered, ought to make phy&s;icians very cauti|ous in limiting the mode of living, and particularly the quantity of food under &s;uch circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I would here al&s;o particularly object again&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e prepo&s;terous at|tempts to combine together food and medicine, which I have frequently ob|&s;erved. Thus I have many times &s;een infu&s;ions of bitter and foeted herbs; &s;uch as the carduus benedictus, flowers of cha|maemel, and the mar&s;h trefoil, commonly called buckbean, directed to be taken at breakfa&s;t, in place either of nutritive &s;ub&s;tances, or &s;uch as by their agree|able flavour promoted the taking in of nouri&s;hment. I have al&s;o &s;een the &s;ame recommended in &s;ome mea&s;ure at din|ner; and I hardly need add, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es I have ob&s;erved the appetite
<PB N="13" REF="15">and &s;trength to be impaired, and all the bad &s;ymptoms &s;ucceed that ari&s;e from a defect of nouri&s;hment. But this, con|&s;iderable as it may be, is not the only inconvenience. It frequently cau&s;es medicinal cour&s;es of this kind to be longer continued than is con&s;i&s;tent either with the intentions of the phy&s;ician, or the health of the patient. Be&s;ides mo&s;t of the &s;ub&s;tances recommended on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are of the bitter kind, and it is well known that the long conti|nued u&s;e of bitters is very hazardous to the health and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The famous Portland Powder for the gout was nothing more than a combi|nation of &s;trong bitters, which had in|deed the effect of preventing the pain|ful returns of that complaint in inflam|mation of the extremities, but was al|mo&s;t always attended with the mo&s;t per|nicious
<PB N="14" REF="16">con&s;equence to health and life. Nor are the ill effects of the long con|tinued u&s;e of bitters to be apprehend|ed by tho&s;e only who are &s;ubject to the gout, &s;ince they act by injuring the tone of the &s;tomach, and if long per|&s;i&s;ted in, will entirely de&s;troy its villous coat. This will &s;hew the danger of employing them for a long period to|gether, whatever the circum&s;tances of the health may be.</P>
<P>Another piece of advice which I have known &s;ometimes given to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tomach and dige&s;tion is weak, is, to take their food as dry as po&s;&s;ible, or to drink as little as they can of any liquid with their meat.</P>
<P>This is among other things advi&s;ed by Dr. Cadogan, in his treati&s;e on the gout and other chronical di&s;ea&s;es. How
<PB N="15" REF="17">this came to be made an article of regi|men in general, I am at a lo&s;s to &s;ay, or how the thir&s;t came to be thought a le&s;s certain &s;ign than hunger, of the proper degree of indulging a natural appetite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fidi autem (&s;itis &amp; fames) naturae duces &s;unt.&mdash;Haller.

Exce&s;s in either is obviou&s;ly prejudi|cial, but of the two, provided &s;piritu|ous liquors be not the object, it is le&s;s dangerous to exceed in quantity of li|quid than of &s;olid food<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Magis in cibo minus in potu peccatur cujus major portio po&s;&s;it qua&s;i infundi, quia ventriculo non retinetur. Haller. Phy&s;iol. vol. 6. p. 254.</NOTE>. I have my|&s;elf frequently &s;een this re&s;triction put
<PB N="16" REF="18">in practice, but never with any good effect; and generally the con&s;equence of it was, to produce or increa&s;e a co&s;|tive habit, which is it&s;elf a frequent and trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom in the&s;e di&s;|orders.</P>
<P>To avoid all vegetable food, fruit, and even bread, and to u&s;e animal food for the &s;olid part of our diet, has been, and &s;till is &s;ometimes recommended in ca&s;es of bad dige&s;tion, attended with flatulence, acidity, and other &s;ymptoms that u&s;ually accompany &s;uch complaints. This has been, no doubt, advi&s;ed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that animal food will not run either into the vinous or ace|tous fermentation, and of con&s;equence produce neither flatulence nor acidity either in the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines. But the truth of this theory is very much to be doubted.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="19">
<P>It has been found impracticable for any per&s;on to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on animal food alone for even a few days, as a putrid di&s;po|&s;ition of the body &s;oon begins to take place, as is manife&s;ted by the nau&s;ea and thir&s;t which almo&s;t con&s;tantly oc|cur.</P>
<P>Some mixture of vegetable food then is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of life. But a compo&s;ition of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances is &s;ubject to both the vinous and acetous fermentations, as appears by Sir John Pringle's experiments on animal and vegetable decoctions, all of which became in time ace&s;cent. Nay, he even found that an admixture of animal matter both accelerated and heightened the acetous fermentation to a great degree.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<P>Animal diet then alone is not capa|ble of obviating the&s;e &s;ymptoms, and I greatly &s;u&s;pect that in many in&s;tances it aggravates them con&s;iderably. Ani|mal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances generate air during the putrefactive fermentation, as well as during the vinous or acetous, and this is ob&s;ervable in putrid fevers, wherein foetid eructations are very fre|quent and trouble&s;ome; and for the cure of which vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are highly efficacious.</P>
<P>This is al&s;o further exemplified in the &s;curvy; a high degree of which is very apt to be produced by a long con|tinued u&s;e of this diet. I have never ob&s;erved my&s;elf flatulence to be in|crea&s;ed by the moderate proportion of vegetables, provided they were dre&s;&s;ed, and either of the root kind, as pota|toes,
<PB N="19" REF="21">&amp;c. Or farinaceous feeds, as rice, barley &amp;c.</P>
<P>Bread likewi&s;e, and perhaps with &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on than any of the other vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, is often included in the general prohibition. This per|haps is the mo&s;t mi&s;taken as well as dangerous piece of advice that can po&s;|&s;ibly be given. The u&s;e of bread is as ancient as the hi&s;tory of mankind, and at the &s;ame time &s;o univer&s;al, that without &s;omething of this nature no people &s;eem to live. Even the dreary Laplander, though from the a&s;perity of his climate unable to rai&s;e corn, makes a &s;ub&s;titute for bread of the inner rind of the pine|tree mixed with dried fi&s;hes, which does not appear to be u&s;ed &s;o much with a view to the nouri&s;hment it anords, as that it &s;upplies a food of a proper con|&s;i&s;tence. For this mankind have an
<PB N="20" REF="22">univer&s;al appetite, which is not difficult to account for. The dige&s;tion of our food depends in a great degree on the mixture of the animal fluids in every &s;tage of it; one of the fir&s;t and perhaps the principal of the&s;e is the &s;aliva, which is con&s;tantly pre&s;ent in all ani|mals, even in in&s;ects. To draw this fluid forth from the glands that &s;ecretes it, a &s;olid food is nece&s;&s;ary as a &s;timu|lus, and to afford a &s;ufficient pre&s;&s;ure; and it is likewi&s;e requi&s;ite that it &s;hould be dry as well as &s;olid, in order to ab|&s;orb the fluid thus pre&s;&s;ed out. Mild, &s;lippery, and fluid aliments, are too inert to act as a &s;timulus, too &s;oft to impart a pre&s;&s;ure, and make too &s;hort a &s;tay in the mouth to exert any effect in this way, and are moreover not fitted to ab&s;orb the glandular liquor.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="23">
<P>Bread likewi&s;e being nece&s;&s;ary to be chewed before it be &s;wallowed, has another &s;uperiority over fluid aliment, as the action of the mouth, in perform|ing that operation, tends to pre&s;s out the &s;alivary glands, while the &s;aliva it|&s;elf, by means of the action of the teeth, is mixed properly with the food. It is likewi&s;e of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice in uniting the oily and watery parts of our food, for which nothing is better a|dapted than bread, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a previ|ous manducation. As a &s;olid body, bread al&s;o, when received into the &s;to|mach, &s;timulates and pre&s;&s;es out the glands, and produces a proper &s;upply of the ga&s;tric liquor, which is like|wi&s;e a purpo&s;e not to be attained by mere fluid aliment. Nor is bread thus prepared much liable to the objections generally made to it and other vegeta|ble food, viz. of generating flatulence
<PB N="22" REF="24">and acidity. If has already pa&s;&s;ed in a great mea&s;ure through the &s;tage of the vinous fermentation, and therefore can undergo it only imperfectly a &s;e|cond time, and its intimate mixture with the animal fluids, the &s;aliva par|ticularly, prevents the acetous fermen|tation going to any great length; which la&s;t indeed, when it takes place, cau&s;es the bread to become in a degree purga|tive, and of con&s;equence to be &s;ooner evacuated.</P>
<P>But in reality the acetous fermenta|tion of which bread is capable, is &s;carce ever increa&s;ed to any great degree, and the &s;our or leavened cakes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is probably owing to the heat u&s;ed in the baking, which acts very powerfully in &s;topping fer|mentation.</NOTE>, in which this fermentation is purpo&s;ely promot|ed, do not appear by experience to give
<PB N="23" REF="25">any unea&s;ine&s;s by their acidity, and are found by many a great preventative of flatulence, as having already compleat|ed the vinous fermentation, they no longer give out air.</P>
<P>Such then are &s;ome of the advan|tages attending the u&s;e of bread in our diet. Let us now &s;ee how the&s;e can be compen&s;ated by &s;ub&s;tituting animal food in the room of it.</P>
<P>Animal food as being in it&s;elf &s;timu|lant and of a &s;olid con&s;i&s;tence, may have the &s;ame effects as bread, in com|pre&s;&s;ing the &s;alival glands, and tho&s;e al&s;o of the &s;tomach; but as its pores are already filled with a fluid, it does not &s;o well ab&s;orb the &s;aliva, or mix &s;o intimately with it. It is likewi&s;e de&s;ti|tute of a proper intermedium for unit|ing the oily and watery parts, in both
<PB N="24" REF="26">of which animal &s;ub&s;tances abound &s;o largely. They are therefore very apt to &s;eparate, and the oily part as the lighte&s;t to &s;wim at top, which cau&s;es tho&s;e oily eructations which flame in the fire, which people of weak dige&s;tion are liable to, and which I have my&s;elf ob&s;erved to be much more frequent with tho&s;e to whom bread is prohibit|ed; and which &s;ymptom I have &s;een manife&s;tly relieved by returning to the u&s;e of that &s;ub&s;tance. The leaving off bread has al&s;o another ill effect in pre|venting the taking in of &s;ufficient nou|ri&s;hment, animal food it&s;elf being ex|tremely apt to pall and nau&s;eate the &s;tomach, and of con&s;equence to be taken in le&s;s quantity than if a proportion of vegetable food was join|ed with it. But the mo&s;t material in|convenience this kind of diet produces, is, by the putrid tendency of the ani|mal
<PB N="25" REF="27">fluids, which it brings on if long continued, and which the u&s;e of bread alone is &s;ufficient in a great mea&s;ure to obviate.</P>
<P>Butter likewi&s;e has been generally advi&s;ed to be ab&s;tained from by tho&s;e who&s;e dige&s;tion is weak and &s;tomach flatulent. The u&s;e of butter, or &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute for it, as oil, is, as far as we can learn, equally ancient, and nearly as univer&s;al as that of bread. It is de&s;cribed in the earlie&s;t hi&s;tories as con|&s;tituting a part of the food of mankind, and &s;eems to have been particularly u&s;ed in tho&s;e countries in which a ve|getable diet was the mo&s;t general.</P>
<P>The propriety of the u&s;e of &s;ome|thing of this kind in food, &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed from the general practice, nor is it difficult to be accounted for.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="28">
<P>Vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, and even &s;ome animal ones, when dre&s;&s;ed by fire, &s;eem to require &s;ome oily &s;ub&s;tance to be taken with them, in order to render them acceptable to the ta&s;te. Thus butter or oil is univer&s;ally de&s;ired with boiled vegetables, and with fi&s;h, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the more in&s;ipid kind, and which them&s;elves contain little oily matter. This &s;eems to be from a na|tural in&s;tinct implanted probably for the purpo&s;e of rendering &s;uch &s;ub|&s;tances more ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and pro|per for nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Oily &s;ub&s;tances them&s;elves are ex|tremely nutritious, as is evidenced by the effects of tho&s;e foods which con|tain mo&s;t oil, as animal food, oily ve|getables, and milk, which are well known to have a great tendency to fat|ten
<PB N="27" REF="29">tho&s;e animals that are fed upon them.</P>
<P>Oily &s;ub&s;tances be&s;ides are not only directly nutritive, but likewi&s;e contri|bute towards &s;upplying the oil nece&s;&s;ary in the animal oeconomy, as the mem|brana adipo&s;a, the marrow, the oily part of the bones, &amp;c. of which there is a con&s;tant wa&s;te, and which requires to be frequently renewed.</P>
<P>Nor is oil u&s;eful in the &s;y&s;tem for the above purpo&s;es only, as it is nece&s;|&s;ary to produce the gelatinous and mu|cous, as well as the oily parts, &s;uch as the &s;ynovia of the joints, the mucus of the bowels, &amp;c. which as Haller ima|gines, are &s;ecreted from the matter contained in the adipo&s;e membrane.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="30">
<P>It is likewi&s;e probable, as Haller &s;ugge&s;ts, that oil is nece&s;&s;ary in our diet to provide a &s;upply of bile, which is mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of an oily matter, and to the generation of which a con|&s;tant &s;upply of that kind mu&s;t be ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Such are &s;ome of the u&s;es of oily food relative to the &s;y&s;tem, or when ab&s;orbed by the lacteal or lymphatic ve&s;&s;els; but it is al&s;o of con&s;iderable importance in the article of dige&s;tion, and for other purpo&s;es in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>Oily &s;ub&s;tances are of great efficacy in checking the vinous fermentation, as we &s;ee by experience, that a very &s;mall quantity of oil will &s;top, or at lea&s;t con&s;iderably retard the fermenta|tion of a large bulk of any liquor in
<PB N="29" REF="31">that &s;tate, and perhaps its effects in &s;topping the ebullition of &s;ugar, for which purpo&s;e it is u&s;ed by tho&s;e who prepare this commodity, may be owing to a &s;imilar cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Tis probable that our fondne&s;s for butter with vegetables, and for cream with &s;ome raw fruits, may be owing to a natural appetite &s;ugge&s;ted to us or the above account.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of oil in the &s;tomach and bowels, &s;eems al&s;o to be nece&s;&s;ary for covering or moderating the acrimony of &s;everal parts of our food, as the pungency or &s;timulus of &s;everal vege|tables, particularly of the &s;pice kind, or the &s;iliquo&s;e plants, with which oil indeed is generally combined, as in &s;al|lads, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="32">
<P>A proportion of oil in our aliment appears al&s;o to be requi&s;ite to keep the alvine evacuations in a regular &s;tate. Whether this effect be produced by its lubricating the bowels, and thus faci|litating the pa&s;&s;age of the food through them, or by its a&s;&s;i&s;ting to generate bile, or to form the natural mucus of the inte&s;tines, I cannot determine; but from repeated experience, I have good rea&s;on to think the fact &s;ufficiently a&s;|certained.</P>
<P>Such, among many others, are the purpo&s;es which an admixture of oil in our food &s;erves in the animal oeco|nomy. Some inconveniencies it un|doubtedly &s;ometimes produces, e&s;pe|cially where the action of the &s;tomach and dige&s;tion is impaired. In the&s;e ca&s;es it is apt to &s;eparate from the other parts of the food, and &s;wim on the top,
<PB N="31" REF="33">and thus produce tho&s;e oily eructation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> before &s;poken of, which are generally e&s;teemed to be among the mo&s;t certain marks of an impaired dige&s;tion. It is likewi&s;e, when thus &s;eparated, apt to become rancid, and then produces that &s;en&s;ation about the pit of the &s;tomach, re&s;embling the heartburn, which is e&s;pe|cially ob&s;ervable whenever the butter or oil has been expo&s;ed to any con&s;i|derable degree of heat.</P>
<P>But the former of the&s;e inconveni|encies, I am &s;atisfied is generally ow|ing, at lea&s;t in a great mea&s;ure, to the regimen of life u&s;ually advi&s;ed in &s;uch ca&s;es, and particularly to the forbid|ding of bread, one of the principal u&s;es of which is to promote the due mixture of the oily parts with the re|mainder of the food; and as to the latter, it in a great degree depends on
<PB N="32" REF="34">the other, and may often be in a great mea&s;ure remedied by care in the choice of our food, and caution in dre&s;&s;ing, that it be not expo&s;ed to too vehement a heat, as in &s;uch ca&s;es it is apt to pro|duce a di&s;agreeable &s;timulus, and is al&s;o hot nearly &s;o mi&s;cible with, the animal fluids, as if none, or a moderate heat only had been employed.</P>
<P>On a review of the&s;e arguments I can|not help being of opinion, that the pro|hibition of butter and oily &s;ub&s;tances to per&s;ons in a valetudinary &s;tate, is by much too indi&s;criminate. In ca&s;es where the habit is corpulent, and inconvenien|cies obviou&s;ly ari&s;e from thence, &s;uch a re&s;triction is highly proper and nece&s;|&s;ary, but the&s;e &s;carce ever occur where the &s;tomach and appetite are impaired, in which ca&s;es the indications in general are of a contrary kind; to &s;upport the
<PB N="33" REF="35">&s;trength, and of con&s;equence the bulk of the body as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t hypochondriacal ca&s;es are of this kind: the &s;ubjects of which are commonly of a lean and &s;pare habit of body, which is indeed a &s;ymptom of the complaint, of the recovery from which there is no &s;ign more certain than the regaining or acquiring a due pro|portion of fle&s;h and plumpne&s;s.</P>
<P>I think I have been able to ob&s;erve &s;everal inconveniencies of the kind be|fore mentioned, to ari&s;e from a re&s;traint in this article of diet, and this without any alleviation of the &s;ymptoms it was intended to relieve; and have &s;everal times &s;een &s;uch per&s;ons return to their former diet, and a moderate u&s;e of &s;ub|&s;tances of this kind in their food, not only without any aggravation, but
<PB N="34" REF="36">often with a manife&s;t abatement of their trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible indeed that if we were to attend to the accounts given by many valetudinary per&s;ons, we might be apt to conceive the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;e|quences liable to occur in many ca&s;es from the u&s;e of butter or oily &s;ub|&s;tances. But the caprice of valetudi|narians, e&s;pecially hypochondriacal per|&s;ons, who form a large proportion of them, is &s;uch as to di&s;able them from much candour of ob&s;ervation, and con|&s;equently to render their accounts very &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>From a habit of ill health they are led naturally enough to a con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, but being in general de&s;titute of the fundamental principles of medical knowledge, they are very
<PB N="35" REF="37">partial in ob&s;ervation, and &s;till more prejudiced in their conclu&s;ions. Add to this an impetuo&s;ity and ob&s;tinacy of temper, which frequently attends &s;uch people, and which is very different from that di&s;po&s;ition which is the mo&s;t likely to devellop philo&s;ophical truths by pa|tient, accurate, and repeated ob&s;erva|tion. Several of the&s;e I have my&s;elf met with, who being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a|gain&s;t its u&s;e, have given the mo&s;t dreadful accounts of the ill effects of a &s;mall quantity of butter or other oily &s;ub&s;tance, yet I have prevailed with &s;e|veral of the mo&s;t prejudiced of the&s;e that I have met with, to make the trial of its u&s;e a &s;econd time, and can &s;afely &s;ay, that I have never ob&s;erved any ill effects there from, provided the cautions before mentioned were attended to; but have always found it grateful and ac|ceptable
<PB N="36" REF="38">to the &s;tomach, rather a&s;&s;i&s;tant than injurious to dige&s;tion, and where its nutritious properties were de&s;ired, highly &s;erviceable, not only by its own proper qualities, but al&s;o by its render|ing other food more agreeable, and of con&s;equence liable to be taken in greater quantity.</P>
<P>The above remarks are applicable not to butter only, but al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure to the fat of animals. There is indeed &s;ome difference; butter is al|ways mixed with a proportion of ani|mal mucilage; which renders it more mi&s;cible with the juices of the body, but at the &s;ame time more apt to be|come rance&s;cent. Vegetable oils are free from this, but at the &s;ame time by long keeping are capable of becom|ing rancid al&s;o, and as all tho&s;e we u&s;e in this country internally, come
<PB N="37" REF="39">from abroad, and of con&s;equence mu&s;t have been long kept, they are &s;eldom if ever free from a taint of this kind.</P>
<P>Animal fats are al&s;o liable to rance&s;|cency, and al&s;o to a higher degree of putrefaction; but as they are always eaten (except in &s;alted meat) before this has time to take place it is of little con&s;equence, and indeed the difference between the&s;e and butter, with re&s;pect to their effects on the human body, is not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed to render it of con&s;equence &s;ufficient to be parti|cularly noticed.</P>
<P>Another of the forbidden articles is &s;ugar, and the &s;ub&s;tances prepared with it. This is probably on account of its ace&s;cency to which it is undoubtedly, under &s;ome circum&s;tances, liable in a con&s;iderable degree. But I much doubt
<PB N="38" REF="40">if it often exerts this quality in the hu|man body, &s;o as to be injurious. The repeated boilings that &s;ugar, at lea&s;t the better kinds of it u&s;ed in this coun|try, have undergone, check in a great mea&s;ure its fermentative quality, and as it is al&s;o with us mo&s;tly u&s;ed under cir|cum&s;tances wherein it has been expo&s;ed to a heat &s;till more con&s;iderable, as in pre&s;erved fruits, pies, puddings, &amp;c. this tendency is &s;till farther corrected. Van Swieten mentions &s;everal examples of per&s;ons who have taken &s;ugar in &s;uch quantities, as not to be e&s;teemed &s;o much a condiment as an article of food, and this without experiencing any of the ill effects that might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from &s;uch a diet, but on the contrary found it an innocent, nutriti|ous, and healthy &s;ub&s;tance. I am &s;ati&s;|fied, from experience, that even crude &s;ugar is &s;o far from adding to the ace&s;|cency
<PB N="39" REF="41">of vegetables, that it checks it con&s;iderably; and I believe it is a com|mon remark, that &s;everal fruits, which eaten alone, create flatulence in many &s;tomachs, have no &s;uch effects when taken with &s;ugar; and what is a great confirmation of this, it is well known that tho&s;e fruits which contain the mo&s;t &s;ugar, e&s;pecially if they approach to a farinaceous con&s;i&s;tence, may be eaten with the greate&s;t &s;afety of any.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances being con&s;ider|ed, it appears that &s;ugar, at lea&s;t in the quantity it is u&s;ually taken, is far from being injurious, even to per&s;ons of a weak &s;tomach and dige&s;tion, nor indeed do I recollect ever to have heard any complaint on that account. It is now found to be not only an innocent but even a nece&s;&s;ary part of the aliment
<PB N="40" REF="42">of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Arm&s;trong on the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t fatal to infants, p. 137.</NOTE> young children, to whom a food of an ace&s;cent nature would be ill a|dapted, as their &s;tomachs are &s;o &s;ubject to acidity; and moreover the fondne&s;e of children &s;or this &s;ub&s;tance, is a great evidence of its &s;alubrity, at lea&s;t to them, and &s;uch a one likewi&s;e as we cannot &s;u&s;pect of being feigned or mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed, or of being any other than a natural in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>But in my opinion &s;ugar is &s;o far from exerting any ill effects in ca&s;es of weak dige&s;tion, that it is highly bene|ficial. In order to render dige&s;tion perfect, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the oily and watery parts of our aliment &s;hould be intimately combined, and the &s;eparation of the&s;e, as I have before remarked, is
<PB N="41" REF="43">one of the &s;tronge&s;t marks of the im|perfection of this proce&s;s.

General experience, however, has not &s;hewn that &s;ugar produces any of the&s;e effects in any remarkable degree.

<P>The la&s;t I &s;hall mention, and as I think the mo&s;t exceptionable direction with re&s;pect to diet, is that of &s;ub&s;tituting brandy, or rum and water for common drink, in place of malt liquours, or other u&s;ual liquid drank at meals, and to quench thir&s;t.</P>
<P>This, I am &s;orry to be obliged to ob&s;erve, is now become too common a practice, and from being advi&s;ed in ex|traordinary ca&s;es, as a temporary expe|dient by &s;ome eminent practitioners, is now commonly directed in almo&s;t all ca&s;es of weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach and dige&s;tive organs by every apothecary, and that not as a thing of temporary nece&s;&s;ity, but as a perpetual article of diet.

<PB N="45" REF="47">
<P>Some may perhaps be of opinion that I have here expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with greater warmth than the &s;ubject re|quires, but the melancholy events, to which I have my&s;elf been a witne&s;s, produced by this odious and in&s;idious practice, prompt me to expre&s;s my di&s;approbation of it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; but as I do not mean to con|demn any practice without endeavour|ing at lea&s;t to give &s;ome rea&s;ons for &s;o doing, I &s;hall next examine the argu|ments that may be brought in favour of, or urged in objection to it.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, it has been, alledged, that brandy, or rum and water may be ex|actly proportioned in point of &s;trength to malt drink, or any other liquour to which we have been accu&s;tomed, and of con&s;equence with re&s;pect to that cir|cum&s;tance mu&s;t be equally innocent.</P>

<P>That it may be every where procur|ed in tolerable perfection, and is hot liable to vary with the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and other circum&s;tances which affect malt liquours, and in&s;tead of de|generating improves by age.</P>
<P>That it is it&s;elf incapable of either the vinous or acetous fermentation, and al&s;o checks it in other &s;ub&s;tances; whence it mu&s;t be highly &s;erviceable in &s;tomachs wherein the&s;e fermentations are apt to be carried too far.</P>
<P>That it is drank commonly in the We&s;t Indies without any ill effects on the health or con&s;titution.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e I would ob&s;erve, that though it be true that brandy or rum and water may be adju&s;ted in point of &s;trength (or its con|taining
<PB N="47" REF="49">a proportionable quantity of alcohol or rectified &s;pirit) to any other fermented liquour, that it is not on that account equally innocent, or indeed &s;imilar in other re&s;pects. The fixible air is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hales found little or no fixible air in bran|dy, and it is a known fact, that vinous &s;pirits will not precipitate lime water.</NOTE> di&s;&s;ipated in the di&s;tillation, the acid part evaporated, and the union be|tween the &s;pirit and the water, when they are mixed for drinking, is much le&s;s uniform and perfect than in a regularly fermented liquor. On this account probably it is found to be le&s;s efficacious in exciting the &s;ecretions, to be le&s;s diuretic and aperient, and at the &s;ame time to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater degree of inflammatory &s;timulus. The&s;e proper|ties are likely to be the cau&s;e of another effect of vinous &s;pirits, viz. that of be|ing
<PB N="48" REF="50">much more apt to produce di&s;orders of the liver than wine or malt liquours.</P>
<P>Another inconvenience of little appa|rent con&s;equence, but in reality very important, is, that the u&s;e of vinous &s;pirits with water is exceedingly deceit|ful.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e to whom this is recommended, begin with great care and caution to mix, with their own hands, the two liquours in proper proportion to each other. This preci&s;ion, however, be|comes in time tedious, and the adju&s;t|ment of the proportion is intru&s;ted to &s;ervants, who at fir&s;t do it by mea&s;ure, and &s;oon after by gue&s;s, and quickly enlarge the proportion of &s;pirit, which as it is done gradually is not perceived by the per&s;on who takes it, and they frequently proceed in this manner until

<P>The momentary relief, likewi&s;e, which this practice affords (as indeed all drams do) is an additional temptation to the continuation of it, and even to induce the unhappy &s;ufferer to take it at various periods through the day, and even in the morning, when &s;uch liquors are peculiarly injurious; and this rather as a mode of relief, than as &s;upplying a fluid for the purpo&s;es of drink. This is frequently the ca&s;e with tho&s;e afflict|ed with hypochondriacal or hy&s;terical
<PB N="50" REF="52">complaints, to whom they indeed afford a temporary relief in the dejections of &s;pirits, to which they are &s;ubject, but who, on the contrary, the &s;oone&s;t feel the ill effects ari&s;ing from their habitual u&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd circum&s;tance men|tioned in defence of this liquour, it is here of little con&s;equence, as malt drink or cyder may, almo&s;t in every part of this country, be procured in to|lerable perfection.</P>
<P>The next argument, that &s;pirituous liquors are incapable both of the vi|nous and acetous fermentations, and on that account are eligible for per&s;ons of weak dige&s;tive faculties, is more plau|&s;ible, and de&s;erves greater attention.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="53">
<P>Many of tho&s;e who give advice on this &s;ubject, and &s;ome writers &s;eem to have con&s;idered the pre&s;ence of air in the inte&s;tines as being always a noxious circum&s;tance; but although this may &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e when it is accu|mulated in too great quantities, it is far from being always &s;o, as it &s;erves &s;eve|ral important purpo&s;es in the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>Air is probably the principal agent in exciting the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, by which the proce&s;s of di|ge&s;tion and nutrition is carried on, and the food di&s;charged. This motion is generally a&s;cribed to the &s;timulus of the food pa&s;&s;ing through them, and di&s;tend|ing them by its bulk, and by that irri|tation urging them to contraction.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="54">
<P>But I apprehend, con&s;idering the length of the inte&s;tines, that the bulk of the food would be in&s;ufficient were it not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by air, with which the inte&s;tines of all animals newly killed are ob&s;erved to be nearly filled.</P>
<P>This affords a cau&s;e of irritation to the whole canal of the inte&s;tines, and keeps up the peri&s;taltic motion through them all. The air likewi&s;e thus pro|truded, &s;erves the purpo&s;e of a &s;olid body in expelling, and al&s;o in collecting the faecal matter, &s;o that it may be evacuated at proper intervals. Nor is air u&s;eful in the inte&s;tines merely on account of its mechanical properties; it is it&s;elf a powerful &s;timulus to the fibres of the tubes of a living animal.</P>
<P>Haller found air equally powerful with the &s;tronge&s;t &s;timulants in excit|ing
<PB N="53" REF="55">the motion of the heart and arte|ries, and on that account concludes that it exerts a &s;imilar power on the the &s;tomach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is extraordinary that the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion &s;hould have the effect of changing the air taken into the bowels or di&s;charged from the food, into in|flammable air, which is the ca&s;e with the air con|tained in the inte&s;tines of animals.</NOTE> and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that we may &s;ome|times be too anxious to guard again&s;t flatulence in our food, which caution is, I believe, often carried to a noxious length, and may, I conjecture, be not infrequently the cau&s;e of the co&s;tive habit which generally aggravates the di&s;order, and which brandy and water is &s;o apt to occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;tomachs indeed of hypochondri|acal per&s;ons &s;eem often to be oppre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="54" REF="56">with flatulence, as appears from their frequent eructations. But I have never &s;een the&s;e relieved by the u&s;e of brandy and water, as a liquour u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of drink; and indeed I believe they are often a convul&s;ive &s;pa&s;m of the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus, which from the cu&s;tom of its being encouraged on the idea of di&s;charging what is noxious, becomes habitual. I have often &s;een this almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly produced by affections of the mind, and al&s;o relieved by cordials, without any di&s;charge of wind; the former of which could have no effect in generating air, or the latter in ab&s;orbing it.</P>
<P>From the above account it &s;eems probable, that the taking of &s;pirituous liquours in this way is not likely to produce the good effects intended by it, and it is certainly often at lea&s;t lia|ble
<PB N="55" REF="57">to the bad effects in a great mea&s;ure of habitual dram drinking. This cu&s;|tom is well known to be generally per|nicious, yet it may not be here impro|per to mention &s;ome of its effects that have been more particularly remarked.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Haller Phy&s;iol. Lib. XIX. &sect;iii.</NOTE> It contracts the &s;tomach it&s;elf and the pa&s;&s;age from the &s;tomach into the inte&s;tines. It al&s;o renders the fibres of the &s;tomach callous and fragile, and in&s;en&s;ible to every &s;timulus, even that of hunger. It contracts the diameter of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem in general. It narrows the air ve&s;&s;els of the lungs even to a third of their former &s;ize. It tends to coagulate all the humours of the body, the aqueous excepted. It pro|duces o&s;&s;ifications of the tendons and arteries, and in &s;ome in&s;tances of the pleura it&s;elf, and often brings on
<PB N="56" REF="58">&s;chirrhus of the whole vi&s;cera and glan|dular &s;y&s;tem. It induces al&s;o tremors, convul&s;ions, and pal&s;y of the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The&s;e effect of the abu&s;e of &s;piritu|ous liquors, are delivered by a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haller.</NOTE> writer of eminence and candour, and are far from appearing to be exaggerated, as undoubtedly many more might be add|ed to them.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be objected that all the foregoing bad con&s;equences have been produced by the abu&s;e of ferment|ed liquours in general, it may be re|plied, that an exce&s;s in the latter is &s;el|dom &s;o habitual, or &s;o frequently repeat|ed as the former from it's con&s;tant u&s;e is likely to be. That the con&s;titutions
<PB N="57" REF="59">of tho&s;e who indulge in the u&s;e of wine or malt liquours are in general more robu&s;t than tho&s;e who u&s;e brandy or rum and water. That the u&s;e of &s;pi|rits, even diluted to a proportionable &s;trength, is not, as has been before ob&s;erved, equally innocent with wine or malt liquours, but more inflamma|tory, and in every re&s;pect more apt to occa&s;ion the di&s;orders above recited, tho&s;e of the liver particularly.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, That the u&s;e of &s;pirits in this way is more dangerous, as being more delu&s;ive and apt to be indulged in, as being often advi&s;ed by the faculty, and the con&s;equences of an exce&s;s are not &s;o immediately a&s;cribed to their true cau&s;e, as in the other in&s;tance, and of cour&s;e not &s;o likely to be guarded a|gain&s;t.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="60">
<P>As to the la&s;t mentioned plea in be|half of this kind of liquour, that it is taken without any inconvenience by the natives of the We&s;t India i&s;lands as their u&s;ual drink, I would ob&s;erve, that though the fact be as repre&s;ented, yet that the circum&s;tances are by no means &s;imilar. The inhabitants of the We&s;t India i&s;lands u&s;e this liquour in a great mea&s;ure from nece&s;&s;ity; malt drink not being procurable, and &s;carce any wine, Madeira excepted, is capa|ble of being kept to a proper age with|out turning sour.</P>
<P>Next, They are very cautious in re|&s;pect to the quality of their liquour, and al&s;o as to the &s;trength of their u&s;ual drink, which is always very weak in re&s;pect of the proportion of &s;pirit, which is regularly ob&s;erved, and al&s;o it is always joined with a con&s;iderable
<PB N="59" REF="61">portion of the juice of &s;ome acid fruit, as limes, lemons, oranges, &amp;c. and with &s;ugar, which not only correct the heat|ing qualities of the &s;pirit, but di&s;po&s;e|the liquour to pa&s;s off by the proper &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>Rum and water thus corrected is al&s;o adapted to the&s;e climates on another account, as being a thin liquour, and free of all vi&s;cidity or tenacity, and con|&s;equently better &s;uited to pa&s;s off by the thinner &s;ecretions, as urine and per|&s;piration (the latter of which is very copious, and nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;tantly kept up) than malt liquour, or the more vi&s;cid wines, even though they could be had in perfection.</P>
<P>The vegetable diet al&s;o upon which the inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands, from the heat of the climate in a great mea|&s;ure
<PB N="60" REF="62">live, is al&s;o a con&s;iderable preven|tative of the ill effects of &s;pirituous liquours.</P>
<P>The di&s;orders which the latter pro|duce are generally of the bilious or liver kind, or at lea&s;t fir&s;t appear in that form; and for the cure of the&s;e, the juices of fre&s;h vegetables are e&s;pe|cially adapted, which probably pre|vents many of the ill con&s;equences which would otherwi&s;e probably accrue from the con&s;tant u&s;e of this liquour. But the per&s;ons in England to whom the taking of &s;pirits with water is ad|vi&s;ed, are in general prohibited from touching any vegetable food: a circum|&s;tance in &s;uch ca&s;es doubly injurious, and I make no doubt that this re&s;traint often greatly enhances the ill effects of the u&s;e of the &s;pirits; and I think I have almo&s;t always ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="63">who live in this way, &s;oon acquire a yellow bilious complexion, which is often attributed to the complaint, but I doubt not is much more frequently owing to the manner of life.</P>
<P>Such are &s;everal of the inconveni|encies which frequently occur from the abu&s;e of this article of diet, to which catalogue, though many more might be added, yet the above are, I tru&s;t, &s;uffi|cient to put us on our guard again&s;t its being ra&s;hly adopted.</P>
<P>I hope indeed that the practice will daily decree&s;e, and with its diminution, I doubt not the health of the people will improve, or as Haller expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on an occa&s;ion not very differ|rent, <Q>"In Anglia certe, po&s;tquam pau|lum de &s;uo furore plebs remi&s;it, ip&s;i
<PB N="62" REF="64">mores, &amp; valetudo civium in melius revertuntur."</Q></P>
<P>I have thus fini&s;hed my remarks on &s;everal articles of diet u&s;ually recom|mended to valetudinarians. But at the &s;ame time that I condemn many of the directions on account of their being incautiou&s;ly advi&s;ed, I do not deny that &s;everal of the above re&s;trictions, even the la&s;t, which I think the mo&s;t exceptionable, may be <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> nece&s;|&s;ary: but I believe that &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity very &s;eldom occurs, and that we ought to be fully &s;atisfied of its exi&s;tence be|fore &s;uch a practice be recommended. It is not every trifling complaint of the &s;tomach that will ju&s;tify &s;uch advice, which indeed, in my opinion, &s;hould never be given but on the fulle&s;t expe|rience, not only that the common mode of living di&s;agreed, but al&s;o that &s;ome
<PB N="63" REF="65">relief was gained by the change, with|out an a&s;&s;urance of which it ought not to be continued; nor &s;hould &s;uch a re|gimen be at all commenced without the mature&s;t con&s;ideration and advice of the mo&s;t experienced of the faculty, who will always think it an unfortunate circum&s;tance to be obliged to pre&s;cribe &s;uch rules which they will only recom|mend for a limited period, and will as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible advi&s;e to be di&s;conti|nued, and the u&s;ual and natural cour&s;e of life to be re&s;umed.</P>
