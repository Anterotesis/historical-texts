<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the members of the Medical Society, on the day of my delivering this Oration be|fore them, did me the honor to reque&s;t its publica|tion, I con&s;idered the reque&s;t as a complimentary cu&s;tom u&s;ual on that occa&s;ion, and as &s;uch received it; however, on a &s;econd and third application, by order of their Council, among&s;t whom freedom of debate on any &s;ubject is expected, and all compli|ment and ceremony incompatible with their cha|racters in that department, I was induced to believe that they might have perceived &s;ome hints, at lea&s;t, not unworthy further con&s;ideration; and, notwith|&s;tanding,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">I had at fir&s;t a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to make &s;uch additions, as to me appeared requi&s;ite, on find|ing they would be infinitely too diffu&s;ive for a work of this nature, and as I could claim protection only by adhering &s;trictly to tho&s;e &s;entiments and opinions which were to them delivered, and upon which they could alone found a wi&s;h for my making them more public; in that &s;tate I now offer them with|out alteration, re&s;erving the elucidation of &s;everal parts for &s;ome future occa&s;ion, as they form the ba&s;is of a larger work, which I have an intention of completing as I can find opportunity.</P>
<P>Should therefore the following &s;heets, which now make their appearance to the world, in compliance with the de&s;ire of the Medical Society, fortunately add the &s;lighte&s;t ray of con&s;equence to that collective Body, and afford the candid Reader &s;atisfaction, my labor will be amply compen&s;ated; particularly as,
<PB N="v" REF="4">at the &s;ame time, it will evince the deference I pay to the Impartiality &mdash; Judgement &mdash; and Abilities of &s;everal Members of that in&s;titution&mdash;as well as the &s;en&s;e of that duty I owe to the Community in general.</P>

<HEAD>ANNUAL ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen, and Fellow-A&s;&s;ociates!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I con&s;ider this in&s;titution formed on the broad ba&s;is of univer&s;al good, the parent of general utility, not of &s;elfi&s;h o&s;tentation; and as this, with its &s;i&s;ter kingdoms, may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled the emporium of medical knowledge, where many of its members, the brighte&s;t luminaries of the Hippocratic &s;chool, have not di&s;dained to convey their di&s;coveries to the world in the common language of this country &mdash; a language, if not e&s;teemed &s;o conci&s;e and elegant, yet full as comprehen&s;ive, <HI>full</HI> as replete with de&s;crip|tive
<PB N="2" REF="7">powers, as any of which Greece or Rome could ever boa&s;t; and as it mu&s;t be allowed, that opi|nions in any art ought to be delivered in modes dive&s;ted of all ambiguity and embarra&s;&s;ment, cer|tainly, con&s;idering our own vernacular language po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e advantages, as being the mo&s;t fami|liar to a very great majority of this audience, <HI>though learned,</HI> before which I have the honor to pre&s;ent my&s;elf, and perfectly under&s;tood by all &mdash; it will not, I hope, be con&s;trued want of re&s;pect, or a carele&s;s inattention to the con&s;equence and dignity ever annexed to profe&s;&s;ional bodies thus a&s;&s;ociated, that I have pre&s;umed to deviate from &s;ome of my predece&s;&s;ors, dropping the tin&s;elled trappings of Roman grace, for the plain, but more u&s;eful orna|ment of Engli&s;h per&s;picuity; and making u&s;e of a vehicle, ea&s;y, as common, to communicate my ob|&s;ervations, in order that I might, through the whole of them, be readily followed, and not in any part mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="8">
<P>For however familiar may be the Latin idiom to readers conver&s;ant in that language &mdash; however ea&s;y to comprehend in its nice&s;t points &mdash; to au|ditors, not con&s;tantly habituated to that &s;tyle of delivery, the familiarity, and ready comprehen&s;ion, would be defective.</P>
<P>On the&s;e con&s;iderations I found &s;ome &s;mall claim to your approbation; and, con&s;idering the arduou&s;|ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent undertaking, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall &s;till farther experience your indulgence. Unimpre&s;&s;ed with this idea, in&s;urmountable indeed would have been the difficulties which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my reflection; but con&s;cious that liberality of &s;entiment, with men of erudition, directs the judgement, and &s;oftens the &s;everity of critici&s;m, every ob&s;tacle vani&s;hed, and diffidence gave way to duty. For it has ever been, <HI>with me,</HI> a fixed principle, and laid down as a law immutable; That, as every individual in the medical hemi&s;|phere is &s;o clo&s;ely, and &s;o nece&s;&s;arily united to the
<PB N="4" REF="9">welfare of mankind, he is bound by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, natural and &s;ocial, to exert his abilities, how|ever weak, when called to promote any laudable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Connected therefore as I am with the members of this medical in&s;titution &mdash; <HI>with you,</HI> who actuated by philanthropy, make &s;cience the plea&s;urable labour of your lives &mdash; and that part of &s;cience your parti|cular &s;tudy, the mo&s;t noble which can engage the pur&s;uit of man &mdash; framed by Divine Wi&s;dom for the relief and pre&s;ervation of the human &s;pecies &mdash; preventing, mitigating, and &s;ubduing many of their corporal calamities &mdash; your wi&s;hes I con&s;idered as a mandate &mdash; and, as you have thought proper to elect me to this office of honor &mdash; an office, which would have been far better &s;upplied by many of your a&s;&s;ociates &mdash; It became me, therefore, to re|flect, what there was in my power to offer, which might in &s;ome, though perhaps too &s;mall a degree, compen&s;ate for your lo&s;s of time and attention to
<PB N="5" REF="10">the con&s;equential avocation of your profe&s;&s;ion, which candour would &s;ubject you to on this occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ant as you are with, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly engaged in, the acqui&s;ition of medical knowledge, and happy in the promulgation, <HI>two points</HI> fell only to my elec|tion; either to furni&s;h <HI>&s;omething new,</HI> for the im|provement: or <HI>&s;omething</HI> to clear what might retard and clog the progre&s;s of the healing art.</P>
<P>Of the former, I fear, I have little to lay before you worthy of your attention; even vanity cannot &s;ugge&s;t to, or per&s;uade, me, that any thing has oc|curred to my ob&s;ervation, with which you may not, perhaps, have been long acquainted &mdash; My ani|madver&s;ions mu&s;t therefore, in a great mea&s;ure, be confined to the latter; wherein I &s;hall only pre&s;ume to offer &s;ome hints, which taken into the con&s;idera|tion of &s;uperior abilities, may a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;o am I led to hope, in extending our particular art to that goal
<PB N="6" REF="11">of perfection, at which human exertions are limited only to arrive.</P>
<P>And, as many ob&s;tacles have been thrown in the way, which have prevented us from ri&s;ing to that achme, as much as human endeavours, united with &s;trong mental powers and indefatigable a&s;&s;iduity, judiciou&s;ly conducted, would have accompli&s;hed; the greate&s;t of which has been the thir&s;t after theoretic knowledge &mdash; it might appear nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;urvey of the progre&s;s of the medic art, from the time of the divine old man, the fir&s;t founder of &s;y&s;|tematic phy&s;ic, to the pre&s;ent aera, in which &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>no le&s;s merited, no le&s;s exalted characters.</HI> But to an audience like this, &s;o well ver&s;ed in the hi&s;|tory of phy&s;ic, and all its branches, it would pro|perly be con&s;idered, a work of pre&s;umption and &s;upererogation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only, as it is nece&s;&s;arily con|nected with my &s;ubject, take a conci&s;e view of the
<PB N="7" REF="12">means by which HIPPOCRATES acquired his know|ledge, exten&s;ive as it was, con&s;idering the period in which he lived &mdash; in the &s;ame manner, &s;hew how his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors rather retarded than promoted the utility of the Ae&s;culapian Art, particularly as &s;ome of our Profe&s;&s;ors &s;teer not altogether clear of &s;imilar errors; and then attempt to point out, where &s;ome of our pre&s;ent modes require the aid of correc|tion.</P>
<P>HIPPOCRATES enriched his mind from ob&s;erva|tion, and founded his practice on facts, &s;imply as they appeared to him; who being ble&s;t with <HI>quick</HI> perception, <HI>nice</HI> di&s;crimination, and <HI>profound</HI> &s;aga|city, made &s;uch di&s;coveries &mdash; deduced &s;uch certain con&s;equences &mdash; and rai&s;ed his &s;uper&s;tructures on &s;o &s;olid a foundation, that he left behind him <HI>&s;tupen|dous</HI> monuments of great abilities;&mdash;<HI>Abilities,</HI> &s;o &s;u|perior to his predece&s;&s;ors, and cotemporaries, that future ages pur&s;ued with avidity, and retained with confidence, many documents framed <HI>in the in|fancy</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="13">of his art &mdash; and happy had it been for later times, had his plan, &s;imple and ea&s;y as it was, been religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved. But, alas! <HI>Man,</HI> as if uncon|&s;cious of his own weakne&s;s, <HI>vain enough</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e he could di&s;cover the <HI>arcana naturae</HI> &mdash; inve&s;tigate fir&s;t cau&s;es &mdash; and carry his curious eye into the darke&s;t labyrinths, began to prefer ingenuity to ob&s;erva|tion; and mounted on the wings of fal&s;e fame, di&s;|regarded the humble paths of mode&s;t inquiry, and built on vain and conjectural hypothe&s;is;&mdash;and what the re&s;ult? Theory aro&s;e after theory; and each &s;ucceeding one, though it corrected the errors of that which had been before adopted, &s;till, like its predece&s;&s;or, &s;unk into oblivion; leaving behind few remains worthy of practical pur&s;uit.&mdash;</P>
<P>Nor is it difficult to account for the cau&s;e, why &s;uch different con&s;equences awaited the&s;e different modes.</P>
<P>HIPPOCRATES, it is &s;aid, by the mo&s;t rigid ob&s;er|vation of every action and motion of nature, of <HI>things
<PB N="9" REF="14">which did in reality exi&s;t,</HI> acquired a wonderful know|ledge of the genuine di&s;po&s;ition of Di&s;ea&s;es; and by carefully comparing the &s;ame &s;ort of di&s;tempers, and their various minute motions in different Pa|tients, and <HI>all</HI> the circum&s;tances and accidents, which u&s;ually preceded, and attended them; he could readily foretel an approaching malady, and after its inva&s;ion give a right judgement of its pro|gre&s;s and event.</P>
<P>As Nature terminated di&s;ea&s;es, when left to her|&s;elf, he ob&s;erved her mode, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> tracing the manner in which the &s;ymptoms, in tho&s;e that were acute, &s;ucceeded one another; hence aro&s;e his art of pre|&s;aging, and thus he formed his method of curing them, by imitating Nature when &s;he proved her&s;elf defective.&mdash;From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, he di&s;covered the u&s;e of <HI>Bleeding&mdash;Scarifications&mdash;I&s;&s;ues&mdash;Setons,</HI> where, in &s;imilar complaints, Nature &s;upplied HAE|MORRHAGES, and ABSCESSES&mdash;<HI>Artificial Diarrhoeas, &mdash;Sudorifics&mdash;Emetics&mdash;Diaphoretics&mdash;Diuretics,</HI> &amp;c. be|cau&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="15">he found &s;he, by &s;ome of the&s;e means, relie|ved the con&s;titution under particular circum&s;tances: hence then he became her humble imitator, con|&s;cious, that &s;he alone was the mo&s;t judicious di|rectre&s;s.</P>
<P>But the Theori&s;ts, forming of them&s;elves a &s;et of principles, PRINCIPLES, <HI>the mere coinage of di&s;tem|pered rea&s;on,</HI> from them deduced all their arguments, &s;upported all their practice, and endeavoured to prove Nature obedient to laws &s;o founded.</P>
<P>Hence the incongruous, elementary, atomical &s;y&s;tems of <HI>&s;ucceeding Sects</HI> &mdash; hence the conceits of an <HI>Helmont</HI> &mdash; the whim&s;icalities of a <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> &mdash; hence a variety of <HI>chemical chimaeras,</HI> and all the incon&s;i&s;tencies of <HI>hydraulic,</HI> and <HI>mechanic &s;ubtlety;</HI> and <HI>hence</HI> fell medicine into &s;hameful di&s;repute, it becoming more the pride of cavilling &s;ceptici&s;m, and &s;chola&s;tic vanity, to build ingenious, though fal|lacious doctrines, than after detecting error, labour|ing
<PB N="11" REF="16">to pur&s;ue Nature through her plain and humble paths.</P>
<P>And it appears a&s;toni&s;hing to a reflecting mind, that notions &s;o ridiculous, practices &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;hould be countenanced in later times; when it is known, that <HI>all</HI> the labours of the ancients, as well as mo|derns, are chiefly valuable for the &s;imple recitals they contain, <HI>founded</HI> on ob&s;ervation, <HI>collected</HI> from appearances, and <HI>delivered</HI> with candour: hence the praeeminence of an <HI>Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Trallian, Aurelianus, Cel&s;us, Tulpius, Lommius, Morgagni, Sy|denham,</HI> and &s;ome others of more modern date; whom to mention, might be con&s;idered as indeli|cate, and the re&s;ult of adulation.</P>
<P>And indeed this &s;implicity, the more it is pur|&s;ued, the more &s;trongly it convinces us of its uti|lity; affording the mo&s;t certain, perhaps the only proper, method of acquiring, and communicating medical information. For the theories of the pre&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="17">day, though fraught with no &s;mall degree of plau&s;i|bility, will not &s;tand the te&s;t of critical inquiry; they <HI>all</HI> appear to be <HI>too generally</HI> applied, in fevers <HI>par|ticularly.</HI> &mdash;Can we &s;uppo&s;e, that in &s;uch, as from their commencement to their termination are at|tended with profu&s;e &s;weating, or a moi&s;t &s;oft &s;kin, a con&s;triction of the cuticular pores takes place?&mdash; In tho&s;e, where the circulation is languid&mdash;the action of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem torpid&mdash;the pro&s;tration of &s;trength &s;udden and extreme, that an <HI>active</HI> &s;ti|mulus is the cau&s;e?&mdash;Or, in tho&s;e where no oppre&s;|&s;ion, load, nau&s;ea, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, or un|ea&s;ine&s;s in the inte&s;tines&mdash;no catarrhal or pulmonic affections manife&s;t them&s;elves, that they deduce their origin from too copious and morbid &s;ecretion of the mucus in tho&s;e organs? Surely not. Yet, the&s;e, by different cla&s;&s;es of practitioners, are con|&s;idered as the proximate cau&s;e of febrile affections, and applied in common to all.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="18">
<P>But within the&s;e man&s;ions, &s;uch a theoretic caco|ethes appears not to be nurtured. If we examine the nature of the proceedings within the&s;e walls adopt|ed, what is the roof, by which we are &s;heltered, but that of an AEDES AESCULAPIANA? If we advert to the public product of your application, what are your memoirs, &s;o ju&s;tly enumerated among&s;t the mo&s;t valuable labours of the medic art, but the TA|BULAE AENEAE TEMPLORUM, ornamented by &s;impli|city, and &s;upported by truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that, at this period, the Author had not &s;ent any papers on medical &s;ubjects to the Society.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor need we take up much time in furni&s;hing proofs of the &s;uperiority of &s;uch a &s;cheme over every other, which has been produced by the fertility of human invention.</P>
<P>View but our Engli&s;h Hippocrates, SYDENHAM; he, by recalling this mode, not only contended with, but conquered, a theoretic world, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="14" REF="19">the powerful oppo&s;ition he met with, invidious, as violent; and we find his de&s;criptions &s;tand at this hour un&s;haken, nor can be overthrown but by the hand of Heaven, when medicine &s;hall be no more. So firmly &s;upported are they by unerring truth; &s;o &s;imply, yet &s;o ju&s;tly, are they delivered; that they are to all intelligible &mdash; by all valued &mdash; by all quoted: even tho&s;e, who, wild with hypothe&s;is, leave nothing behind them but reliques &s;imilar to the&s;e, which can attract our attention, or merit our ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Still, notwith&s;tanding we are convinced of the de|captive notions by which &s;ome of our early prede|ce&s;&s;ors were governed &mdash; notwith&s;tanding we can view the efforts of our cotemporaries not perfectly con&s;i&s;tent in the application of their &s;peculative opi|nions &mdash; notwith&s;tanding the advantages, unknown to former ages, which daily are pre&s;ented in every branch of medical philo&s;ophy; which are di&s;cover|able by &s;light ob&s;ervation, and may be truly arranged
<PB N="15" REF="20">with the <HI>cau&s;ae evidentes.</HI> We avail not our&s;elves of the&s;e advantages, or apply them &s;ufficiently, to ren|der our modus medendi as perfect as it might be.</P>
<P>There is too great, too general a &s;olicitude in &s;earching after SPECIFICS, and inquiring into the nature of the &s;emina morbi, as if the former did exi&s;t&mdash;or the latter were within the reach of human inve&s;tigation. We &s;eem to be more anxious about the AGENTIA MIRIFICA, than the AGENDA, as if the latter were completely under&s;tood; that they were is devoutly to be wi&s;hed; for they come more ma|terially under our con&s;ideration; at lea&s;t it appears to me a truth irrefragable, that were we to pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention to the con&s;titution, &s;tudy more mi|nutely its parts, dependencies, moving powers and pe|culiarities, practice would be dive&s;ted of many errors, with which it too unfortunately at pre&s;ent abounds.</P>
<P>However, that we may be enabled to prove the validity of this a&s;&s;ertion, we &s;hall attempt to &s;hew
<PB N="16" REF="21">THE FALLACY OF THE FIRST OF THESE PURSUITS&mdash; THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DEMONSTRATING THE NATURE OF THE SECOND, IN GENERAL &mdash; and, THE REAL UTI|LITY OF ATTENDING CLOSELY TO THE THIRD, AND ITS MODE OF BEING APPLIED, in order to add to the improvement of the Art.</P>
<P>And, FIRST,</P>
<P>No idea, perhaps, has done more real injury, than <HI>that of Medicines acting &s;pecifically in conquering Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>&mdash;Of this truth, a very &s;uperficial examina|tion will convince us: for it retards our re&s;earches in inve&s;tigating their full and true powers &mdash; it pre|vents us, con&s;equently, from extending tho&s;e powers &s;o as to be as diffu&s;ively u&s;eful as they might &mdash; it lays the foundation for a thou&s;and deceptions; cau&s;ing us to attribute particular con&s;equences to ma|terials, which do not from thence, in reality, origi|nate, and keeping their true &s;ource hid from our ob|&s;ervation &mdash;nor is this all; it does wor&s;e &mdash; it often, by occa&s;ioning delay, increa&s;es the malady, reme|dies
<PB N="17" REF="22">thus con&s;idered, are pretended to &s;ubdue, nay frequently generating di&s;orders of a more delete|rious nature; overturning that fir&s;t and &s;alutary caution, which directs us in all our efforts, if we fail to do good, to do no harm.&mdash;<Q>"Is artis medicae &s;co|pus e&s;t; ut hominem a <HI>tot gravibus malis</HI> liberet; ideoque Medicus <HI>nullo modo</HI> nocere, nedum Vitam de&s;truere, aut Sanitatem laedere debet, utpote quum <HI>Medicina</HI> non <HI>nocendi,</HI> &s;ed <HI>juvandi,</HI> &s;it Scientia."</Q> HOFFMANNUS.</P>
<P>Indeed the mi&s;chief cea&s;es not here; it proves detrimental in another view; for it places the cre|dulous Philo&s;opher, and Phy&s;ician, on a footing with the impudent and ignorant Empiric, and too often throws &s;uch an odium on the Art it&s;elf, that Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the fir&s;t eminence are frequently held in contempt, and treated with ridicule, by the injudi|cious and illiterate, who fly with confidence to the cabinet, and depend upon the pre&s;uming arrogance of every plundering impo&s;tor.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="23">
<P>Still, &s;trange as may be the appearance, painful the reflection to an informed mind, why &s;hould it be matter of &s;urprize? Do not the Phy&s;ician and Medica&s;ter too often a&s;&s;ign the &s;ame rea&s;on for their &s;ucce&s;s, THE SPECIFIC POWER OF THEIR APPLIED AN|TIDOTE, and build on the &s;ame fortuitous exhibi|tion? And under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the mode&s;t diffidence of the one can never, with the million, &s;tand again&s;t the bold bu&s;tling ignorance of the other&mdash;for men of weak di&s;criminating powers, of which <HI>nine tenths</HI> of mankind con&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t if we confine them to medical under&s;tanding, will give credit to the opinions of creatures of their own level, and place, as Indians with their painted pa|gods, confidence in, and pay large tribute to, things their folly and &s;uper&s;tition have &s;et up.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the credulity in this point of many profe&s;&s;ors of the art, <HI>Men</HI> held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation adopting &s;uch ideas, handing them down to po&s;terity, and having them received by &s;ucceed|ing
<PB N="19" REF="24">generations&mdash;is it not &s;ingular, that not <HI>one</HI> &s;pe|cific has ever yet been di&s;covered, out of the num|ber which have acquired the appellation?</P>
<P>It has been, and is now, by &s;ome, thought due to the Bark in an intermittent fever&mdash;to Quick&s;ilver and its preparations in the Syphilis; but in reality, even the&s;e merit no &s;uch di&s;tinction: for let us a&s;k, Do they in all ca&s;es, as if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;pecific power they would, become infallible? Or, will they by any means prevent the acce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e di&s;tem|pers? Practice proves the contrary; for they will not alone always cure the&s;e complaints&mdash;and men have been &s;eized with intermittents whil&s;t under a cour&s;e of Bark&mdash;and the lues venerea with a mer|curiated habit.</P>
<P>As well might mode&s;ty and judgement be united to the names of <HI>M</HI>*******, <HI>G</HI>******, or <HI>any other empirical depredators</HI> with which this metropolis is loaded; as well might infallibility be added to

<P>Indeed, if we &s;earch into the practice of men highly elevated in their profe&s;&s;ion, who retain &s;uch a &s;pecies of ab&s;urd faith, we &s;hall find &s;uch glaring contradictions&mdash;circum&s;tances militating &s;o diametri|cally again&s;t, and &s;o totally &s;ubver&s;ive of the&s;e opi|nions, that we mu&s;t be convinced of the fallibility of &s;uch a dogma.</P>
<P>For it is not uncommon to have accounts pub|li&s;hed by &s;ome of the efficacy of a medicine in cer|tain complaints, which cures, they tell us, SPECIFI|CALLY, to which are tacked a long catalogue of ca&s;es in proof; whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, in the hands of others of equal eminence, tried under &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances, no &s;uch &s;urprizing effects are manife&s;t|ed. Need I, to what I have already mentioned, add the accounts of <HI>ar&s;enic, hemlock, deadly night-&s;hade, henbane, flores cardamines, flores zinci, fo&s;&s;ile</HI> alkali,
<PB N="21" REF="26">and &s;ome others, which have been foi&s;ted upon the world under &s;uch a pretence? All having work|ed miracles under the direction of &s;ome, whil&s;t others have failed in the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>To what are we to attribute this diver&s;ification? Can we di&s;pute the abilities of the authors? It would be con&s;idered pre&s;umptuous.&mdash;Can we doubt their veracity? It would be thought illiberal.&mdash;Dare we think they are attempting to acquire &s;ame from fal&s;e principles? It would be con&s;trued invidious.</P>
<P>What are we to conjecture? Certainly that no &s;uch &s;pecifics exi&s;t; and that tho&s;e who were fa|vourers of &s;uch an opinion, unwilling, or unable to pur&s;ue their re&s;earches, were happy in having &s;o ea&s;y a &s;upport to re&s;t upon; or, uninclined to le&s;&s;en their con&s;equence, by receding from &s;entiments once adopted, and publicly &s;anctioned by their fiat, con|de&s;cended to &s;uffer &s;cience to be cloathed in an unintelligible jargon, and lead men, credulous as
<PB N="22" REF="27">them&s;elves, to believe it was impo&s;&s;ible to proceed farther, plea&s;ed as well with the phantom, as the reality of knowledge. Hence was a check given to particular inquiries, by implicit confidence being paid to hoary-headed ob&s;tinacy, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, cunning, creeping under the cloak of fal&s;e expe|rience: hence was the healing art impeded in its progre&s;s by &s;uch a belief; and hence a few charac|ters called great, made thou&s;ands appear little, and live in the &s;hade of indolence and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Examine but the works of <HI>Galen, Dia&s;corides, Oriba&s;ius, Me&s;&s;u&euml;, Boerhaave,</HI> and almo&s;t all the wri|ters of the Materia Medica of former ages, and compare them, with what has been written by &s;ome of the late&s;t authors, who have made real experience the te&s;t of their opinions, you will find, that a multiplicity of errors, from time to time, have been tran&s;mitted from one to another, forming a con|temptible farrago of &s;pecific ab&s;urdities.&mdash;View but the imaginary powers be&s;towed on BEZOAR and SAF|FRON,
<PB N="23" REF="28">two out of the numberle&s;s in&s;tances, which might be produced. What mighty virtues have not been attributed to the former, by men renowned for medical &s;agacity? So multifarious, &s;o efficacious, that almo&s;t all powerful medicines, or, tho&s;e ima|gined &s;uch, were called Bezoardics; and what from faithful experiment is it now proved? one of our mo&s;t imperfect ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>What has not been &s;aid of Saffron?

Indeed the great BOERHAAVE con&s;iders a few drops of the extract of Saffron, in&s;pi&s;&s;ated only to the con&s;i&s;tence of oil, and taken in a gla&s;s of rich wine, as highly exhilarant and cordial. How different from the experience of this day! for ex|cept in very large do&s;es, &s;affron is not known to
<PB N="24" REF="29">produce any effects, and of the&s;e accounts are very rare and doubtful.</P>
<P>But as an apology for this credulity, might it not be called fanatici&s;m? It has been a&s;&s;erted, that the means, by which medicines produced their effects, at lea&s;t tho&s;e to which were attributed a &s;pecific power, were impo&s;&s;ible to be detected and account|ed for; and indeed the &s;ame notion is too prevalent at this day, in many ca&s;es.

<PB N="25" REF="30">
<P>However, to prove the fallacy of this opinion, let us examine one medicine, which has long been held replete with &s;pecific power, and which claims more the title, could &s;uch be allowed, than any other medicine with which we are acquainted, if we ex|cept Quick&s;ilver; we &s;hall by that means detect the errors accruing from &s;uch an idea, and perceive the benefits ari&s;ing from the di&s;covery of its true action &mdash;Benefits, which &s;hould &s;timulate us in all ca&s;es to &s;imilar inquiries: I mean the BARK.</P>
<P>This was long con&s;idered to cure Intermittents <HI>&s;pecifically</HI>&mdash;that is, we know not how&mdash;by &s;ome la|tent inexplicable power; and indeed &s;uch was the confidence placed in this miraculous drug, &s;o thought, incomprehen&s;ible as a&s;toni&s;hing, that in ca&s;es of this kind, it was indi&s;criminately exhibited&mdash;though very often productive of great mi&s;chief&mdash;till from long continued, and often repeated trials, &s;ome of the more judicious ob&s;ervers found, that this &s;pecific power was not always in Intermittents an inoffen|&s;ive,
<PB N="26" REF="31">much le&s;s a certain curative agent, not even of the &s;ame complaint at different times in the &s;ame per&s;on: hence it became nece&s;&s;ary to inquire, from whence this deviation aro&s;e, and in which &s;tate of the complaint it might be productive of the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; and it appeared to be when the con&s;titu|tion had been harra&s;&s;ed, and the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem &s;o far oppre&s;&s;ed, as to be debilitated by the preceding malady, or was, <HI>ab initio,</HI> in that &s;tate&mdash;For given at fir&s;t, when the con&s;titution was in full vigor, it pro|duced very dangerous effects, converting quotidians, and tertians, into continued Fevers, aggravating, in|&s;tead of alleviating the febrile &s;ymptoms, and form|ing a variety of other di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;equences.</P>
<P>On con&s;idering the&s;e phaenomena, it was manife&s;t, that what was thought its &s;pecific power, depended upon &s;ome exertion which occa&s;ioned the &s;y&s;tem to act, under &s;ome circum&s;tances, with too much force, by increa&s;ing the va&s;cular tone.&mdash;Hence men, imbi|bing this idea, laboured to abate the activity of the
<PB N="27" REF="32">con&s;titution, by bleeding, purging, &amp;c.&mdash;or &s;uffered it to be weakened by delay, before they exhibited this medicine, which was then almo&s;t always &s;uc|ce&s;sful, unle&s;s prevented by &s;ome con&s;titutional de|fect, that at the &s;ame time required for its allevi|ation or &s;ubduction &s;ome attention.</P>
<P>It appears therefore obvious, that the virtue of this medicine lay not in its correcting or de&s;troying the mia&s;ma, or virus, producing the Intermittent, but in the exertion of its tonic power; hence a peculiar &s;tate of the con&s;titution was nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of knowing that &s;tate before we can promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the particular power of this <HI>univer|&s;ally allowed &s;pecific</HI> was developed, by ob&s;ervation and experience; and there remains no doubt of the Bark producing generally, I might have &s;aid always, the di&s;agreeable, and &s;ometimes dangerous effects above &s;pecified, if given too early, or per&s;i&s;ted in&mdash;
<PB N="28" REF="33">without it brings on &s;ome debility at fir&s;t, as it &s;ome|times does, by becoming purgative: and it may be laid down as an invariable rule in practice, that where there is in the habit &s;trong va&s;cular action, and an inflammatory diathe&s;is of the blood, which are, I take it, generally conjoined, Bark univer&s;ally does harm, &mdash;where the contrary con&s;titution is prevalent, uni|ver&s;ally good, if no topical defect impedes, or coun|teracts its action: nor does the Bark being &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;ome local inflammatory complaints, at all inva|lidate the force of the argument; for in tho&s;e ca&s;es, the di&s;order it&s;elf is not an active, but a pa&s;&s;ive in|flammation.</P>
<P>Similar arguments might be adduced to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, proving the known action of Quick&s;ilver, and its &s;aline compounds, capable of producing its good effects, in&s;tead of its imaginary <HI>&s;pecific powers,</HI> and of &s;ome others. But what I have advanced will, I hope, prove &s;ufficiently &s;atisfactory to &s;hew, that by this idea of medicines acting &s;pecifically, no &s;mall
<PB N="29" REF="34">impediment has been thrown in the way of medical improvement: for men, &s;atisfied with this LUSUS, this LARVA RATIONIS, practi&s;ed from principles fal&s;ely founded, nay, <HI>very often,</HI> without any principles at all &mdash;occa&s;ioning great lo&s;s of time, and not only doing mi&s;chief by injudicious application, but keeping the exten&s;ive powers of many active medicines immer&s;ed in ob&s;curity. Hence, tho&s;e formerly admini&s;tered in one malady only, to which their <HI>&s;pecific power</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ingularly adapted, we now find, their modes of action being brought to light, in a variety of others extremely u&s;eful and ine&s;ti|mable.</P>
<P>Yet it is very extraordinary, that men flying from inquiries after properties it may be in their power to di&s;cover, &s;hould ru&s;h forward in pur&s;uit of what lies far beyond their reach, the NATURE OF THE SE|MINA MORBI, the &s;econd point appropriated for di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.</P>

<PB N="42" REF="47">and mu&s;cular &s;tamina, &s;o do con&s;titutions vary, and &s;o are different effects produced by &s;imilar cau&s;es; which we &s;ee often occur in epidemic, and other complaints, where, though the leading &s;ymptoms may be &s;imilar in a great degree, the concomitants will be different, and put on various appearances, as we find in the recitals of the &s;ame complaints by different authors: hence ari&s;e many of the &s;pecies and varieties of different genera of di&s;ea&s;es; hence a deviation in our modus medendi, and hence the good effects of one medicine in &s;ome in&s;tances at one time, which produce no &s;uch benefit at another, in complaints con&s;idered as &s;imilar: and hence, per|haps, al&s;o ari&s;e the good or bad effects of the &s;ame medicine given in different do&s;es, and likewi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of forming different combinations to make it act with certainty and &s;ucce&s;s in different con&s;ti|tutions.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, take a &s;urvey of the effects of medicines in different do&s;es, or differently com|bined,
<PB N="43" REF="48">and &s;ee what conclu&s;ions we may from thence deduce.</P>
<P>Opium, in full do&s;es, in&s;tead of proving anti-&s;pa&s;|modic, anodyne, or narcotic, has often created other di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms; and &s;o far from taking off &s;pa&s;ms, alleviating pain, or procuring &s;leep, occa|&s;ioned nau&s;ea, vertigo, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, whil&s;t in &s;maller do&s;es it has procured every de&s;ired purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mercury al&s;o, given in a &s;imilar manner with re|&s;pect to the do&s;e, has al&s;o occa&s;ioned di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, in&s;tead of affecting the &s;alivary &s;y&s;|tem, its chief &s;cene of action, producing nau&s;ea, gripings, and bloody &s;tools, whil&s;t in &s;maller do&s;es, it has readily been ab&s;orbed into the habit, and gra|dually brought on a ptyali&s;m, nay often cured with|out any perceptible effect.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, Bark has been the cau&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, purging, and con&s;tantly rejected
<PB N="44" REF="49">by vomiting; producing not any of its &s;alutary ef|fects, either by prolonging the apyrexy, or taking off the febrile affections, which have been accom|pli&s;hed by cold or hot infu&s;ions of this medicine.</P>
<P>On the contrary, &s;mall do&s;es of the&s;e very ac|tive materials have been productive of no &s;en&s;ible or curative effect &s;ometimes, whil&s;t admini&s;tered in larger do&s;es, their good con&s;equences have been made manife&s;t.</P>
<P>And again: It is indi&s;putably true, that the&s;e medicines given in any quantity or form, they may, the mo&s;t perfectly agreeable to the con&s;titution, and without having any painful concomitant circum|&s;tances attendant, have by ho means an&s;wered the de&s;ired purpo&s;e; but being joined with other reme|dies, have proved &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>What then can be the cau&s;e of the&s;e deviations? Is it in the medical ingredient it&s;elf? Impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;
<PB N="45" REF="50">For every medicine con&s;idered in it&s;elf, ceteris pa|ribus, mu&s;t always be alike; its action mu&s;t be in|variably the &s;ame; and in &s;imilar con&s;titutions, or in the &s;ame con&s;titutions under &s;imilar circum&s;tances mu&s;t univer&s;ally produce the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>Though I am well aware it may be urged, that the &s;ame medicine in the &s;ame per&s;on has appeared to act, as if it varied its mode of action; this will be readily granted&mdash;but then it has been owing to &s;ome change brought upon the habits by illne&s;s, in|di&s;cretion, or &s;ome other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>For medicines producing in a &s;tate of full health one effect, will create others in a &s;tate of illne&s;s, with re&s;pect to the con&s;titution; though the action of the medicine mu&s;t be the &s;ame.&mdash;For the con&s;ti|tution labouring under an indi&s;po&s;ition, its powers are altered, they act not under a &s;tate of healthful nature, but require &s;omething to relieve and regu|late them&mdash;Now the &s;ame medicine which relieves,
<PB N="46" REF="51">and regulates them, during the illne&s;s, would, when the illne&s;s was conquered, and the powers of the con&s;titution returned to their natural order, or &s;tan|dard, produce bad effects if continued, ina&s;much as the &s;ame action of a medicine in illne&s;s, producing the &s;ame effect on the habit, brings that habit into a &s;tate of health by that very action; which action, the body being in an healthful &s;tate, is too power|ful; for it then needing no &s;uch aid, would have its powers too much increa&s;ed, and by that means di&s;tre&s;s from that very &s;ource would be occa&s;ioned. &mdash;The &s;ame argument may be made u&s;e of, where debilitating means have been applied, in order to reduce the too active powers of the habit, morbidly affected.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced I conclude, there|fore, that the cau&s;e of the&s;e deviations depend &s;olely on the &s;tate of the con&s;titution, and by no means on the nature of the medicine.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="52">
<P>Now, as I con&s;ider the action of medicines, and the &s;emina morbi, to be exactly under the &s;ame point of view, regarding their re&s;pective operations on the machine, and effects produced&mdash;I &s;ay, the&s;e depend totally on the nature of the con&s;titution operated upon&mdash;for in&s;tance,</P>
<P>If a <HI>Man of &s;trong &s;tamina, great va&s;cular irrita|bility, &s;teady, regular, nervous incitability, firm texture of the blood,</HI> was to be &s;eized with an intermittent fever, of the quotidian or tertian type, from mar&s;h mia&s;ma&mdash;in order to form his cure, the va&s;cular ir|ritability mu&s;t be abated, the too &s;trong tone of the &s;olids, and mu&s;cular fibres in &s;ome degree debilita|ted, and the cohe&s;ive power of the blood weaken|ed&mdash;by bleeding, purging, cooling, &s;aline medicines, antimonial diaphoretics; &mdash; which done, the Bark might afterwards be admini&s;tered. And if a man of a &s;imilar con&s;titution takes &s;o large a quantity of heating &s;timulants as to produce the &s;ame febrile appearances, without intermi&s;&s;ion &mdash; the treatment
<PB N="48" REF="53">would be the &s;ame.&mdash;Not from the mia&s;mata, or &s;timulants, having produced the&s;e effects&mdash;but from the &s;ame con&s;titutional cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But was the mar&s;h mia&s;ma to affect a <HI>man of de|bilitated habit, weak nervous incitability, and enfeebled va&s;cular irritability, with a loo&s;e texture of the &s;angui|nary ma&s;s</HI>&mdash;cordial, nervous medicines with the u&s;e of bli&s;ters might be added to the u&s;e of the Bark; and the&s;e would be required from con&s;titutional cau&s;es al&s;o,&mdash;that the con&s;titution it&s;elf might be rouzed to feel the tonic power of that remedy, and experience its good effects.</P>
<P>A variety of other in&s;tances might be offered in proof of the &s;ame po&s;itions&mdash;and this mode of rea|&s;oning will be found applicable to almo&s;t all ca&s;es; particularly, all &s;uch as are general in the habit, or are owing to general affections: and the more it is examined into, the more the propriety and nece&s;|&s;ity of paying particular attention to what has been
<PB N="49" REF="54">&s;pecified will appear; but what has been &s;aid will, I hope, be &s;ufficient to &s;upply the propo&s;ed hints, and lead me to my la&s;t propo&s;ition.</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>That one pre&s;ent &s;ource of retarding the progre&s;s of the medic art, is the loo&s;e and neglectful manner in which ca&s;es and their modes of cure, or want of &s;ucce&s;s, are de&s;cribed.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>It has, I flatter my&s;elf, been clearly proved, as far as the time allotted upon this occa&s;ion will per|mit, that the con&s;titution, with its different divi&s;ions, require the fir&s;t attention of the Phy&s;ician; and it will readily occur, that in practice it is to be con|&s;idered not only collectively, but ab&s;tractedly; that it &s;hould be found out in what part the con&s;titution is mo&s;t defective, whether re&s;pecting its <HI>nervous In|citability&mdash; va&s;cular Irritability &mdash; mu&s;cular Strength &mdash; texture</HI> or <HI>compo&s;ition of the Blood</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Fluids</HI>&mdash;and <HI>the Appendiculae.</HI></P>
<PB N="50" REF="55">
<P>For as all the parts act in combination with each other, as they tran&s;mit to each other the principle of their power, yet may experience &s;eparate affec|tions inherent in them&s;elves, which may be gene|rally or partially communicated, creative of general or partial di&s;turbance &mdash; they &s;hould always be par|ticularly attended to: ina&s;much as the neglect of &s;ome, may occa&s;ion too often our endeavours to be|come abortive.</P>
<P>But we find commonly too little &s;aid on the pre|valent peculiarities of the con&s;titution, upon which different medicines have been tried in &s;imilar di&s;|ea&s;es, wherein they have &s;ometimes proved &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful, &s;ometimes otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, as medicines act differently in different quantities&mdash;with different combinations&mdash;in diffe|rent con&s;titutions&mdash;in the &s;ame con&s;titutions at dif|ferent periods &mdash; in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e at the different times of the malady, with regard to the good or bad
<PB N="51" REF="56">effects they produce &mdash; and as this apparent diffe|rence of action depends upon the different &s;tates of the moving powers, and what I call their appendi|culae, the con&s;titutional peculiarities &s;hould always be nicely di&s;criminated.</P>
<P>This mode would often enable us to di&s;cover, on what account various remedies had been &s;ucce&s;sful; wherein they had failed, and direct us to the be&s;t method of &s;electing and combining medicines, and of curing di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as fall immediately under the Phy&s;ician's care; and a&s;&s;i&s;t, in mo&s;t, to which the Surgeon lays claim, as little, very little is to be done with the &s;emina morbi, and the &s;pecific power of our remedies is merely ideal. For as is the &s;tate of the moving powers and fluids, with their combi|nations, &s;o will be the action of our medicines, and con&s;equently &s;o will be the indications in our appli|cations.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="57">
<P>Permit me, before I conclude, to offer a ca&s;e, by way of exemplification, which will afford, I pre&s;ume, no weak proof of what has been advanced.</P>
<P>Mr. *****, a per&s;on of middle age, had been &s;ome time afflicted with a di&s;ea&s;e, &s;imilar to what is termed GONORRHAEA LIBIDINOSA.</P>
<P>His mu&s;cular &s;tamina were tolerably good; he had a great deal of nervous incitability; weak va&s;|cular irritability; the texture of the blood not firm, nor could be called broken; his dige&s;tion, tho' his appetite was tolerable, defective; he had now and then chilline&s;s, &s;ucceeded by flu&s;hing heats, which came on irregularly; his pul&s;e in general was &s;low, and undulating; and when quickened, as it would now and then be, on &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions, weak; his vi&s;cera all appeared found;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though delicacy prevents the in&s;ertion of the Name, &s;till any medical Gentleman, de&s;irous of further information, may acquire it by application to the author, who, for the &s;ake of accuracy, read this account three times to the patient, and he, <HI>at that time,</HI> perfectly coin|cided with the exactitude of the de&s;cription.</NOTE>
<PB N="53" REF="58">his bowels very irregular, &s;ometimes extremely co&s;|tive, at others as much the rever&s;e&mdash;always in one extreme or the other; his urine pale, and limpid for the mo&s;t part, but now and then depo&s;iting a whi|ti&s;h, furfuraceous, mucilaginous &s;ediment &mdash; he was petulant, and ira&s;cible when trifles perplexed him; when not, timid and de&s;pairing&mdash;his fluids were acri|monious; his memory weak, and his recollection painful; creative of much unea&s;ine&s;s, when he could not bring to his mind that of which he was in que&s;t &mdash;his whole frame was in general &s;o languid, that &s;light motion greatly fatigued him; his extremities were in general cold &mdash; in ea&s;terly or &s;outh-we&s;t winds he always complained of being wor&s;e, and was perceptibly &s;o &mdash; his nights were con&s;tantly re&s;t|le&s;s &mdash; he had &s;ometimes two or three emi&s;&s;ions in the night; complained of partial heat at the lower part of the back, which he &s;aid, now and then, tran&s;|fu&s;ed it&s;elf all over him, and made him extremely faint&mdash;he was never thir&s;ty.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="59">
<P>In this &s;tate he had continued for ten months, though now vi&s;ibly growing wor&s;e, and had been under the care of two phy&s;icians of eminence: they had put him under a cour&s;e of re&s;tringent medicines &mdash; bark, white vitriol, gin&s;eng, &amp;c. and ordered him the cold bath; but all proved inef|fectual.</P>
<P>At this period, his con&s;titution was con&s;idered in general after the mode above recommended; taking in al&s;o the topical affection&mdash;a weakne&s;s of the &s;e|minal ve&s;&s;els, and determination of the fluids to tho&s;e parts creating heat, and cau&s;ing emi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The INDICATIONS OF CURE were,</P>
<P><HI>To determine the Fluids externally, by increa&s;ing Per&s;piration &mdash; to &s;trengthen the dige&s;tive Organs &mdash; in|crea&s;e the Irritability of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem &mdash; abate the nervous Incitability</HI> &mdash; and <HI>give tone and firmne&s;s to the habit in general,</HI> which were accompli&s;hed by cor|dial &s;aline diaphoretics, warm tonics, camphorated
<PB N="55" REF="60">and aethereal anti-&s;pa&s;modics, and &s;tomachic bitters &mdash;keeping the body moderately and gently open by mild aperients.</P>
<P>Under this method, his extremities fir&s;t lo&s;t their coldne&s;s, in a great degree, and when warm, he always found him&s;elf relieved; at which time there was a great itching in his &s;kin, which was di&s;tend|ed, appearing like an univer&s;al e&s;&s;era, the matter by a general &s;timulus under the &s;kin, elevating the whole &s;urface regularly, not &s;hewing any eruptions, except here and there, one now and then, on his brea&s;t, or on the lower part of the head, ju&s;t above the neck, at the roots of the hair. He began now to recover every day, and when his &s;y&s;tem &s;hewed it was in &s;ome degree invigorated, bathing in the Thames and riding exerci&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed his cure.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the former Gentlemen had been &s;o long un&s;ucce&s;sful, appears very obvious: they had not paid any attention to the torpid &s;tate of
<PB N="56" REF="61">the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, on which account the fluids were always crowding upon the internal parts, ha|ving their acrimony increa&s;ed; and the a&s;tringent medicines, not being capable of exerting their ac|tion, from a defect of va&s;cular irritability, the ve&s;|&s;els being in &s;uch a &s;tate of torpor, as not to feel the effects.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els, being before in a wea|kened &s;tate, &s;uffered a partial irritation, by the fluids there collected, occa&s;ioning &s;timulus, and in|crea&s;ed heat &mdash; emi&s;&s;ions &s;ucceeded emi&s;&s;ions &mdash; the machine became more and more debilitated &mdash; the nervous incitability increa&s;ed; the con&s;equence of which would &s;oon have been a hectic fever with a tabes.</P>
<P>Would time permit, a variety of ca&s;es might be adduced, in which &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;s from &s;imilar rea|&s;ons have confirmed the validity of a practice &s;o founded &mdash; and I am fully per&s;uaded, that in all our
<PB N="57" REF="62">recitals of ca&s;es, whether &s;ucce&s;sfully or un&s;ucce&s;s|fully treated, were we to advert to what, perhaps, by &s;ome may be con&s;idered as minutiae too trifling in the pre&s;ent &s;cale of phy&s;ic, we &s;hould find, as well from one as the other, much u&s;eful matter proceeding&mdash;And I have no doubt but we &s;hould di&s;cover, in very many, if not in all, the rea&s;ons why accounts &s;o &s;imilar in their de&s;criptions, &s;o di&s;|&s;imilar in their con&s;equences, have, and do pre&s;ent them&s;elves daily to our view.</P>
<P>But I flatter my&s;elf, what has been already ad|vanced will be &s;ufficient to afford hints, that may induce &s;ome more capable to attempt the inve&s;tiga|tion, and give &s;till clearer views than lies within the compa&s;s of my very limited knowledge: I &s;hall, therefore, conclude in the words of a favorite au|thor, as they are expre&s;&s;ive of my wi&s;hes&mdash;<Q>"Non dicam, quod ad commodiorem &amp; certiorem me|dendi methodum nihil exinde inveniri po&s;&s;it.
