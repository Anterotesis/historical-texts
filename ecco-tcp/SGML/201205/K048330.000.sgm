<P>A Di&s;sertation upon the Nervous System to show its Influence u|pon the Soul.</P>
<P>Man can know little, and yet he wants to know all things, He is con|fined to a point of time in this life, yet extends his Views backwards &amp; forwards, through Millions of Ages, till he is lost in eternity.

<HEAD>DISSERTATION ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain, in a &s;imple manner, the Na|ture of tho&s;e bodily powers, which Con&s;titute the very Principles of Life.</P>
<P>The Human Body is &s;u&s;tained and kept a|live, by three principal powers, which like the movements of a Clock or Watch, co-operate and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other: The fir&s;t is the brain and Nervous Sy&s;tem proceeding from it, the grand Source of all Sen&s;ation; The Second, is the Heart and Arteries, or blood Ve&s;&s;els, which give motion and circulation to the Blood; And the Third is the Stomach and Bowels, which prepare the Aliment and &s;up|ply Nouri&s;hment for tho&s;e, as well as all parts of the Body.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>In &s;peaking of Dige&s;tion it will be remark|ed, that the Stomach lo&s;es its power when de|prived of Nervous Influence; and we &s;hould here take notice, that the Regularity and Vi|gour of the Heart's motion, chiefly depend on the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As therefore the Brain and Nerves, the Heart and Arteries, and the Stomach and Bowels, are the principal in&s;truments of all Sen&s;ation, Circulation, Nutrition, Life and Motion, and the very Agents which govern and direct the whole Animal Machine; It will be nece&s;&s;arily con&s;equent, that when any of them becomes di&s;concerted, and put out of order, the vital functions of the Body depen|ding upon them, mu&s;t then be unduly per|formed. <Q>"where one Link's broken, the whole chain's de&s;troyed."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the extraordinary Sympathy and in|tercour&s;e between tho&s;e &s;everal organs, that like &s;o many little provinces, allied by mutual Intere&s;t, not one of them can exerci&s;e its full power without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and concurrence of the re&s;t; for as the Heart and Stomach cannot act without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Brain, or the Stomach Dige&s;t without receiving a due Quantity of blood from the Heart; &s;o neither can the Heart have &s;ufficient force to keep up the circulation, without a continual &s;upply of nouri&s;hment from the Stomach;
<PB N="3" REF="5">or even the Brain it&s;elf exert its Influence over tho&s;e organs without being duly nou|ri&s;hed by Both. Although it will evidently appear, that the Nerves are the Immediate or|gans of all vital motion and Sen&s;ation, and the medium by which impre&s;&s;ions made on the Body are in&s;tantly conveyed to the mind; yet the preci&s;e manner by which this mi&s;teri|ous intercour&s;e is carried on, remains a &s;ec|ret in nature with which, perhaps, we &s;hall never be acquainted</P>
<P>So intimately connected are the Body and Soul, and &s;uch their Corre&s;pondence, that Impre&s;&s;ions made on the one naturally influ|ence the other with the like feelings: Thus, by immoderate grief the dige&s;tive faculty of the Stomach is impaired and taken away, and by a blow on the head which injures the Brain, the Soul is as it were dethroned, and lo&s;ing its empire over the Body, all &s;en&s;e and motion are in&s;tantly de&s;troyed. The Soul, or Intellect, whil&s;t confined to the Body, "That muddy Ve&s;ture of decay," is obliged to &s;toop to the &s;tate and condition of the Nerves, who&s;e feelings are liable to alteration from a thou&s;and accidental or unavoidable cau&s;es, &s;o as to occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es, or being to|tally aboli&s;hed, to produce in&s;tant death. Tho&s;e, as well as many other circum&s;tances, concur to prove that the faculties and di&s;po|&s;ition
<PB N="4" REF="6">of the mind, in a great mea&s;ure, depend on the bodily organs with which they co-ope|rate, and where tho&s;e are changed from their natural State, &s;o are its appetites and oper|ations.</P>
<P>How different is the State of the Body and Soul when the ve&s;&s;els are empty or full, viz. after long fa&s;ting, or a plentiful meal, in the fir&s;t the pul&s;e is weak and unequal, the Com|plexion pale, the Body languid, and the Spi|rits de&s;ponding: But after eating and the mo|derate u&s;e of wine, the Springs of Life are wound up, and the Body and Soul are re&s;tor|ed to their native vigour.</P>
<P>The con&s;ent between the Brain and Heart is remarkable, for, inten&s;e Study or thinking quickens the Pul&s;e, and a &s;udden fright will occa&s;ion palpetations or a convul&s;ive Struggle of the heart, even &s;ometimes to a mortal &s;uf|focation: in both the&s;e ca&s;es, the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion is made on the Brain, and the Heart, like a faithfull companion, &s;uffers by &s;ympa|thy; but whether the Nerves act as Tubes, or Vibrating Cords, like the Strings of a mu|&s;ical In&s;trument, or whether they &s;erve as conductors to &s;ome &s;ubtle fluid &s;imilar to that of Electric Fire, we are wholly ignorant The Brain &s;eems therefore to the Nerves, what the Heart is to the Blood Ve&s;&s;els or Arteries; for too violent a degree of Action in the la&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="7">will produce heat and increa&s;e circulation, as may be ob&s;erved after violent exerci&s;e, or in the time of a Fever: in like manner, when the power of the Brain and Nerves is too vio|lently impre&s;&s;ed on the Body or Soul, their Sen&s;ations will be rendered too quick and exqui&s;ite; like the motion of a watch, which becomes rapid and irregular when the main &s;pring acts too &s;trongly on the &s;everal wheels and &s;ubordinate movements.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ions made on the Soul will often totally &s;ubdue tho&s;e of the Body: and on the contrary, &s;uch as are made on the Body, will remove tho&s;e of the Soul; all which may &s;upply an Intelligent ob&s;erver with u&s;e|ful hints in the cure of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as have been un&s;ucce&s;sfully treated by medicines.</P>
<P>Religious doubts which perplex the Soul with alternate Hopes and fears, a Sedentary life, or warm, damp air, all di&s;po&s;e the con|&s;titution to Melancholy, by weakning the Nervous power. Tho&s;e are the general cau&s;es of low Spirits, and acquired melancholy, which always operate mo&s;t powerfully on People of nice Sen&s;ations, who&s;e Plea&s;ures and Pains from over-delicacy of the Nervous Sy&s;tem, are too exqui&s;ite for &s;en&s;e; but the preci&s;e manner in which they produce their effects, or why &s;uch cau&s;es do not always oc|ca&s;ion &s;imilar con&s;equences, in &s;uch a parti|cular State of the Nerves, is utterly unknown.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<Q><L>"Where Joy mo&s;t revels, Grief doth mo&s;t lament;</L>
<L>Grief Joys. Joy grieves, on &s;lender accident."</L></Q>
<P>Tho&s;e, on the contrary, of more clum&s;y or|gans, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of little more than Vegetable-feeling, never experience the mi&s;e|ry of Nervous Di&s;orders; but if they have le&s;s plea&s;ure, the account is balanced by their enduring le&s;s pain.</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that the Body and Soul, receive all their information by means of the Brain and Nerves, and that by Tho&s;e they mutually conver&s;e and &s;ympathize with each other; hence it will follow, that whenever tho&s;e Organs are Injured, and like unfaithful Me&s;&s;engers, do not truly execute their Office, and repre&s;ent things as they are, the Patient will then be impo&s;ed upon, by Delu&s;ive Perception, and figure to her&s;elf things which have no exi&s;tence, but in her own di&s;tempered Brain.</P>
<P>They &s;uppo&s;e that every one looks upon them with a malignant eye, and puts the wor&s;t con&s;truction on what they &s;ay and do; In &s;hort, though they are indu&s;trious to torment them&s;elves, by means which appear ludicrous, they experience &s;ub&s;tantial mi&s;ery, and are &s;ometimes driven to de&s;peration, and Suicide; &s;o that in the whole catalogue of earthly evils, human Nature cannot pre&s;ent an object more truly pitiable!</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>What then &s;hall be &s;aid of tho&s;e who either from Ambition or the view of gain, &s;tifle the feelings of honour and humanity, and &s;ordid|ly &s;ubmit to form alliances which Entail he|reditary mi&s;eries on their po&s;terity, more grie|vous than death it&s;elf! and who, therefore, in&s;tead of remembering the Authors of their being with filial affection, mu&s;t behold them with indignation and &s;orrow!</P>
<P>Retirement and bodily ea&s;e are not de|&s;tructive to the melancholy, for whil&s;t they &s;it &s;till unemployed, they become a prey to their own thoughts. On the contrary, exer|ci&s;e and &s;everity of Diet, are beneficial; for no one can think or &s;tudy with the &s;ame at|tention, when impre&s;&s;ed with the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of Hunger, or tormented with a ra|ging tooth, as when he is perfectly at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Since we find that painful &s;en&s;ations ap|plied to the Body or Mind, often de&s;troy health and occa&s;ion Melancholy; by parity of rea&s;oning it may be concluded, that plea&s;ur|able feelings of a contrary nature will bid faire&s;t to re&s;tore it: The chiefe&s;t of tho&s;e are, Chearful Company, Poetry, Mu&s;ic, and Dramatic entertainments of the Comic kind, Frequent exerci&s;e in the open Fields, or flower Gardens, the waters of Tunbridge or Spa, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that &s;overeign remedy the
<PB N="8" REF="10">Peruvian Bark, and the u&s;e of the cold Bath, will al&s;o be found powerfully Salutary.</P>
<P>The Study of Natural Hi&s;tory, and em|ployment of delineating &s;ome of its mo&s;t beau|tiful and minute objects arranged under their proper cla&s;&s;es, as tho&s;e of Birds, In&s;ects and Flowers, will afford very plea&s;ing and rational entertainment and a&s;&s;i&s;t in diverting the mind from things of a more &s;erious nature. Parti|cular thoughts and reflections of the mind are joined with certain conditions of the Bo|dy; and therefore, our manner of living, in a con&s;iderable Degree, changes our manner of thinking. Hence by Pravelling, the univer|&s;al benefits of Air, Exerci&s;e and Diet, will at once be mo&s;t agreeably obtain'd; all which tend to &s;trengthen the Con&s;titution, and to wear out di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ions made on the Body or mind by introducing others of a dif|ferent nature.</P>
<P>The next Sovereign remedy in di&s;ea&s;es of the mind is Mu&s;ic. Cicero a&s;&s;erts it's amaz|ing power, and Plato Suppo&s;es the effect of harmony on the mind is equal to that of air on the Body: Its Divine influence is exempli|fied by David in the Cure of Saul; and the Ea&s;tern Monarch who had conquered the world, was him&s;elf Subdued by the Seraphic Strains of Timotheus's Harp, which &s;o capti|vated his ear, that he was rou&s;ed into mad|ne&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="11">or &s;oothed into melancholy as the &s;ounds became &s;prightly and animated, or Solemn and Slow.</P>
<P>So wonderful is the empire of Mu&s;ic over the mind, as recorded by the antients, that it leads the &s;oldier undaunted to the <Q>"Immi|nent deadly breach."</Q> and alternately &s;tops the rage of conque&s;t by its varied power: It mitigates bodily pain, &s;u&s;pends the malignant force of madne&s;s and de&s;pair, and lulls the Soul into traquility and peace.</P>
<P>The effect of mu&s;ic however will be differ|ent according to the &s;tile, and manner of its compo&s;ition, and therefore &s;hould be adapted to the particular &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind. The plaintive Tone of &s;oft Flutes will induce a plea&s;ing languor, and compo&s;e it when tortured with rage or irritated by the more violent pa&s;&s;ions; and on the Contrary, the merry pipe and Tabor will exhilerate, and rai&s;e the moping head of melancholy, depre&s;|&s;ed by Religious De&s;pair, Di&s;apointed Ambi|tion, or hopele&s;s Love.</P>
<P>Let us appeal to the refined feelings of tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of the Divine power of harmony, to prove its &s;overeign influence over the mind; that it is the true oblivious Antidote, the Nepenthe of the Gods, to heal a wounded Spirit, to exalt the Soul above low-thoughted care, and lap it in Ely&s;ium.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>This great &s;en&s;ibility occa&s;ions people of Rank to be Victims of their mo&s;t favourite feelings; all that afflicts or threatens others, all the evil incident to mankind in general, are to them real grievances, affecting them, very frequently, more than their own private complaints, and e&s;&s;entially de&s;troy their health; in a word, infinitely more &s;en&s;ible of tender impre&s;&s;ions, and expo&s;ed to a much greater number than the Pea&s;ant, of nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t &s;uffer much more.</P>
<P>Nerves continually agitated by humours which are always irritative, by di&s;ordering the harmony of the Organs, and enfeebling the Body, murder the mental faculties; which are &s;o much dependant on the Situation of its &s;urrounding body, that whatever di&s;orders The oeconomy of the one, ab&s;olutely preju|dices the mode of thinking in the other.</P>
<Q><L>"That bright'ning ray, by God him&s;elf be&s;tow'd,</L>
<L>Blends with our Sen&s;es, and like them grows weak."</L></Q>
<P>Nervous di&s;orders, that di&s;po&s;ition to be too ea&s;ily affected and &s;u&s;ceptible of irregular and painful emotions, is one of the mo&s;t cruel &s;courges to people of rank that has been ad|vanced. It mo&s;t commonly occurs, and till now, has been particularly unhappy in a mi&s;|taken treatment, becau&s;e its origin had not
<PB N="11" REF="13">been &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigated: it's different Species, which required very different reme|dies, was left unexamined. This Branch of Phy&s;ic is at pre&s;ent too much confined to hypothe&s;is, the Subject of party di&s;putes, or at lea&s;t influenced by Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Many Eminent Phy&s;icians, regarding all di&s;orders of the Nerves as the Con&s;equences of relaxed fibres, and weak dige&s;tions, would effect a cure by means of remedies which are hot, and &s;trengthening, by Gums, Steel, Bit|ters, Camphire, Ca&s;tor, Mu&s;k, Spirituous Tinctures, Opium, &amp;c. which is an error &s;i|milar to the following, in &s;peaking of indi|ge&s;tion and Stomachic remedies. In attri|buting all Nervous complaints to one cau&s;e, they have propo&s;ed but one kind of remedy, which unhappily has no better &s;ucce&s;s than in complaints of the Stomach. Nerves inflamed by the immoderate u&s;e of Aromatics, are not relieved by u&s;ing A&s;&s;afoetida; a &s;harper Me|dicine than the mo&s;t piquant Aromatic: tho&s;e who are dried up by the abu&s;e of Barbadoes Water and Mara&s;quin, will not find a&s;&s;i&s;tance by drinking great quantities of the Tincture of Gentian, of Valerian, or of Ca&s;tor; but tho&s;e remedies &s;o hurtful, in the&s;e ca&s;es, are very beneficial in ca&s;es where a weak fibre, or poor and watery Blood are the true cau&s;es of the complaint, and &s;uch ca&s;es often do occur.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
<P>That Tea affects the Nerves of the Stomach is evident, by its communicating di&s;agreeable Sen&s;ations upon the Soul. That the Soul becomes affected when the dige&s;tion of the Stomach is impaired, is al&s;o evident, &s;o that the Soul cannot be an&s;werable in that ca&s;e, for Actions of the Body; for without the Nerves are braced up to the Standard of the Soul, it's ideas are imperfectly connected: &s;o that it is clear, the Nerves operate upon the Soul, as the Works of a Clock regulate the Movement in keeping Time.</P>
<P>That extreme &s;en&s;ibility to all Impre&s;&s;ions, which render many &s;o unhappy, &s;hould be treated like di&s;orders of the Nerves, on which it depends, and often requires cold Baths, Milk diet, much exerci&s;e, and the courage to brave the open Air, and tho&s;e things which we mo&s;t dread.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Di&s;order only exi&s;ts in the Imagination. The vapouri&s;h per&s;uade them|selves they are not able to do any thing, when they are very &s;trong; they fancy every thing incommodious which they are very well able to bear; they deprive them&s;elves of, and re|nounce, all enjoyments, frighten them&s;elves with an unexi&s;ting Bugbear, and court a real one. Such Ca&s;es require the Phy&s;icians ut|mo&s;t penetration: If he is deluded, the Patient is lo&s;t; but if he deceives the Patient, and gains
<PB N="13" REF="15">his confidence, a Cure is the work of a mi|nute. I have &s;een five &s;uch Per&s;ons, who fancied they could neither bear light, noi&s;e, air, or food, keep their Beds in a dark and matted Chamber, where none were &s;uffer'd to walk, move, or &s;peak out, but with the ut|mo&s;t precaution; lived only on Broth and Jellies; thought them&s;elves dangerou&s;ly ill, &s;ettled their Affairs, and all this while they were perfectly well: I compelled them to &s;ee, hear, &s;peak quit their Beds, and even their Hou&s;e, to eat and act like other People, to feel them&s;elves well, and pa&s;s in one quarter of an Hour from the greate&s;t Mi&s;ery to the greate&s;t Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t be per&s;uaded the Nerves are im|mediately affected by the Labours of the Soul: inactivity is al&s;o &s;ufficient to de&s;troy them, and often produces this effect, even in Per&s;ons who&s;e mind is as indolent as their Body The Nerves are the principal parts of the Machine, whenever any of the Animal Functions are di&s;turbed, they mu&s;t undoubtedly be injured.</P>
<P>When the Nerves are affected without any &s;en&s;ible cau&s;e, one would be led to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e would &s;oon appear, the &s;ource of which might po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;covered by attentive ob&s;ervation and be the more ea&s;i|ly de&s;troyed before the di&s;ea&s;e had come to any height. Some di&s;orders, (of the Stomach
<PB N="14" REF="16">e&s;pecially) &s;hew them&s;elves more readily by the effects they have on the Nerves; for they being a kind of Medium between the Soul and the Body, are expo&s;ed to &s;uffer from the irregularities of each, and communicate to the one, the injuries they receive from the other: thus it is that the Soul becomes prejudicial to the Body, and the Body hurtful to the Soul, and that they are both combined in de&s;troy|ing the Nervous Sy&s;tem.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider what is to be done to obtain a cure in Nervous Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, we are exactly to regulate the u&s;e of non-naturals; For in vain is a pre|&s;cription of medicines, if the Patient is not directed and willing to ob&s;erve certain regu|lations, in relation to Air, diet&punc; and Exerci&s;e. Chu&s;e a free open Air, not incumber'd with Hills or Woods A dry cool Air, braces and Invigorates the whole Body; while a Hot, confined, and damp Air, weakens and relaxes the Habit. When the Stomach and Bowels are weak&punc; they &s;hould be well guarded again&s;t cold and Damps e&s;pecially in Winter; and there is no dre&s;s better and more nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="15" REF="17">keep up a due per&s;piration, than Flannels worn next the Skin.</P>
<P>Con&s;tant exerci&s;e, every day that allows of it, either in walking, on hor&s;e-back, or in an open Chai&s;e, is of va&s;t &s;ervice; it &s;hould be as much as the &s;trength will admit, without weakne&s;s, fatigue or hurry; never weary your&s;elf, nor rai&s;e a Sweat, go no further, than you can return with as much &s;pirit as you went out. Exerci&s;e &s;trengthens the whole Nervous Sy&s;tem, a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, (but retards it after a full meal; therefore after dinner &s;it a while) Sangnification, and the di&s;tribution and &s;ecretion of all the Animal Fluids. By mu&s;cular motion, the blood and Juices are kept in a due &s;tate of Fluidity; their Vi&s;cidi|dity is broken and di&s;&s;olved, and all ob&s;truc|tions either prevented or removed. The fle&s;h Bru&s;h is an excellent thing for &s;trengthening the Solids; as friction, either with the fle&s;h bru&s;h, flannel or coar&s;e Linnen Cloth, &s;trengthens the Body, promotes the circula|tion, and is particularly u&s;eful in weak Bow|els.</P>
<P>People of weak Nerves are generally quick thinkers, from the delicacy of their &s;en&s;itive organs, which we therefore more liable to be fatigued and relaxed with exerci&s;e, than tho&s;e of a Coar&s;er make; whence we &s;ee the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of keeping the mind ea&s;y, quiet and
<PB N="16" REF="18">chearful, &s;ince nothing hurts Nervous People more, than fear, grief, and anxiety. U&s;e therefore agreeable amu&s;ements, and a little &s;light, entertaining and diverting reading, that requires no thought, for all Study is pernicious and hurtful. Conver&s;ation &s;hould be agreeable trifling and ea&s;y, without di&s;pute or contradiction; amu&s;ements be Innocent, various, and not expen&s;ive: otherways, upon reflection, the money laid out would do more hurt, than the amu&s;ements could recompence. In a word, all thought and care mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide; and rationality mu&s;t give place for a while, to a way of life, which Bath gives a pattern of. I cannot but highly approve of a practice there, of having mu&s;ic, while the Patients drink the Water; which has a very great and good effect upon the motion of the finer animal Fibres. Mu&s;ic has been allow'd, in all ages of the world, to have a Noble pow|er in rai&s;ing the dejected ideas of the Soul. Tho&s;e that have the mo&s;t delicate con&s;tituti|ons, are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of its good effects; it opens the ob&s;tructions of the fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els; a&s;&s;uages the pa&s;&s;ions, and at the &s;ame time communicates a plea&s;ure to the Soul, and makes its ideas chearful, gay and lively; by the o&s;cillatory motion of the Air, vibrating a|gain&s;t the tempanum of the ear, there is &s;uch an impul&s;ive motion given to the fine&s;t fibres
<PB N="17" REF="19">of the Brain, (upon which the Soul more immediately di&s;plays its Faculties) as to enable them to bring regular impul&s;es to the &s;en&s;o|rium.</P>
<P>But mu&s;ic, though it re&s;tores the Tone of the fine&s;t Fibres of the Brain; yet the inferi|or organs demand coar&s;er treatment, to re|&s;tore them to the Standard of health</P>

Drink &s;mall Beer, &s;oft fine ale, or Wine and water; but never u&s;e water alone.

A Gla&s;s of wine before Dinner, on an empty Stomach, and when one is Languid, feeble or faint, is of great &s;ervice.

When the &s;tomach and Bowels are troubled with a|cidity, water mixed with Rum or Brandy, is preferable to Wine, or Malt Liquor.

<P>But of all things&punc; the cold Bath is the greate&s;t &s;trengthener of the Nerves; it re|moves glandular ob&s;tructions, rai&s;es the Spi|rits, and vivifies and &s;trengthens the whole Man; for Children, delicate con&s;titutions, and Women liable to mi&s;carriages, or trou|ble&s;ome floodings, nothing can be better. Cold Bathing. I am per&s;uaded, is analagous to the Bark, which is al&s;o a very proper Me|dicine, for it &s;trengthens the Stomach, Mu&s;|cles, Nerves, and even the Soul it&s;elf, and enables them to &s;upport fre&s;h fatigues. I have known &s;everal young Per&s;ons throw them&s;elves into the Cold Bath, after being wearied and depre&s;&s;ed with Study, who al|ways found upon coming out&punc; a peculiar &s;trength of mind, and a fre&s;h di&s;po&s;ition to Study.

<P>The u&s;e of Bark and the Cold Bath toge|ther is pointed out by the Nature of their Virtues; they produce the &s;ame Effects; and being combined will cure di&s;orders, which every other Remedy would only have en|crea&s;ed.

Yet on coming out I have found my Nerves &s;o Braced, and my &s;pirits &s;o &s;trength|ened, that in a manner I viewed an other and a Spiritual State, with &s;uch extacy as made me ready and de&s;irous to enter into it. I &s;hall here too further recite what I once met with at Margate in Kent, where the late King of Britain arrived from Germany, and u&s;ed the Cold Bath, and drank the Waters with great Advantage which is expre&s;&s;ed, by an in&s;cription on a &s;tatue erected on purpo&s;e, in this manner.</P>
<Q>"Thy Baths give Vigour, and thy Waters Health."</Q>
<P>For altho' the Water only acts immediately on the Cutaneous Nerves and Ve&s;&s;els, yet it's &s;trengthening power is, by &s;ympathy, com|municated to the inmo&s;t parts of the Body, and mixes radically with the Fluids.</P>
<P>Daily experience convinces us of the power of the Soul upon the Stomach. Tho&s;e mo&s;t addicted to reflection, perform their Dige&s;ti|on with greater difficulty; on the contrary, tho&s;e who think little, generally dige&s;t well. We frequently &s;ee Per&s;ons of weak under|&s;tandings eat and drink very freely, without
<PB N="22" REF="24">&s;uffering any inconvenience, although they lead &s;edentary lives, and have not remarkably &s;trong con&s;titutions. On the contrary, how many &s;en&s;ible Men do we &s;ee, who&s;e Dige&s;tion is performed with much pain and difficulty, although they are of a good habit of Body, and u&s;e &s;ome exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The connection of the Soul with the Body is in fact &s;o &s;trong, that it's even difficult to conceive how one of them &s;hould act, and the other not be &s;en&s;ible, in a greater or a le&s;s degree, of that action. The Organs of Sen&s;e being put in motion, convey the Subject of thought to the Mind, by acting on the Fibres of the Brain; and while the Soul is employ|ed in thinking, the parts of the Brain are in a greater or le&s;s forcible motion, and in a le&s;s or greater degree of ten&s;ion. The&s;e Motions fatigue the medullary or Nervous portion of the Brain; and this delicate &s;ub&s;tance, after a long cour&s;e of Meditation, becomes as much exhau&s;ted, as a &s;trong Man is after exerci&s;e. Whoever has thought inten&s;ely, even once in his Life, mu&s;t have experienced this in him|&s;elf: and there is certainly no very Studious Man, who has not often felt, on coming out of his Clo&s;et, violent pains in his head, at|tended with a great degree of heat in this part. This heat will depend on the proportion of wearine&s;s and inflammatory ten&s;ion, which
<PB N="23" REF="25">the medullary &s;ub&s;tance has undergone: the eyes &s;oon become &s;en&s;ible of this fatigue; and if we con&s;ider a Man who is deeply engaged in thought, we &s;hall &s;ee that the Mu&s;cles of his Face are all upon the &s;tretch, and &s;ome|times appear even convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>A great Author has taken notice of the Danger of fixing the Attention too &s;trongly. <Q>"When the Action of the Soul is too pow|erful," &s;ays he, "it attacks the Body &s;o violently, that it throws it into a con&s;uming State: if the Soul exerts it&s;elf in a peculiar manner, on certain occa&s;ions, the Body is made &s;en&s;ible of it, and becomes heated and debilitated."</Q></P>
<P>Another Author of note has ob&s;erved the &s;ame, and &s;ays; <Q>"The union of the Soul with the Body is &s;o intimate that they, re|ciprocally &s;hare the good or evil which hap|pen to either of them. The Mind or Soul cannot put forth its powers, when the body is tired with immoderate exerci&s;e: and too clo&s;e an application to &s;tudy de&s;troys the Body, by di&s;&s;ipating the Animal &s;pirits, which are nece&s;&s;ary to recruit it."</Q></P>
<P>The brain, which is the immediate &s;eat of the&s;e emotions, the nerves which ari&s;e from it, and the Stomach, which is furni&s;hed with many nerves of an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ation&punc; are the parts fir&s;t attacked, and commonly mo&s;t in|jured
<PB N="24" REF="26">by the immoderate labour of the mind; but if it &s;hould continue for any length of time almo&s;t all the parts of the body become partakers of the injury.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ymptoms which indicate a weak|ne&s;s of the Nervous Sy&s;tem, are a kind of pu&s;illanimity we were before &s;trangers to; Diffidence, fear, grief, dejection and Di&s;pirit|edne&s;s: he who was the mo&s;t intrepid man now becomes the mo&s;t timorous; the &s;lighte&s;t undertaking frightens him, the mo&s;t trifling unfor&s;een incident makes him tremble; the &s;lighte&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition appears to him a fatal di&s;ea&s;e; and the idea of Death fills him with intolerable horrors. Some Tyrants have con|demned certain Philo&s;ophers, whom they ha|ted, to death, but have never been able to make them fear it; how much more effectu|ally would their cruelty have been exerci&s;ed if by &s;uffering them &s;till to Live, they could have in&s;pired them with tho&s;e fears of Death hypochondriacs are tormented with? We &s;ee in&s;tances every day of men of Learning, who perceiving the fir&s;t &s;igns of this di&s;temper, have been obliged to for&s;ake their favourite &s;tudies; who&s;e Nerves being weakened, they become incapable of attention; their memory fails: their Ideas are confu&s;ed; a Sen&s;ation of heat in the Head, palpitations, a total dejec|tion,
<PB N="25" REF="27">and the apprehen&s;ion of death makes the pen fall from their hands.</P>
<P>The injury the mind has done the Body &s;oon recoils upon it&s;elf; for it has been the will of the &s;upreme Being, that as long as the&s;e two Sub&s;tances continued together, the labours of the mind &s;hould in a certain de|gree depend upon the health of the Body: this truth has been ever acknowledged. An Author has emphatically declared, that <Q>"the props of the Body &s;upported the Soul," And that, "Health increa&s;es the powers of the mind; when the body is di&s;ea&s;ed the mind is not capable of reflection"</Q> It is not therefore &s;urpri&s;ing that the mind &s;hould be weakened, after it has exhau&s;ted the Brain and Debilitated the Nerves.</P>
<P>An Eminent Phy&s;ician who lived long in a City where learning is much cultivated, &s;ays, That &s;tudy begins by impairing the Stomach and that if the complaint is not relieved, it may degenerate into a melancholy. And that a vitiated Stomach attends Learned People, as &s;urely as the &s;hadow follows the Body. That he has &s;een Patients who &s;uffered for this immoderate thir&s;t of Learning, fir&s;t by a lo&s;s of appetite, an entire inability of the Di|ge&s;ting Powers, and a total debility which en&s;ued; afterwards they have been tormented
<PB N="26" REF="28">with &s;pa&s;ms, convul&s;ions and at length with a total privation of all their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>When the Dige&s;tion is imperfect, the hu|mours imbibe a crude quality, which renders them unfit for their various de&s;tinations; and which particularly prevents Nutrition, upon which the reparation of all the Powers de|pends. To be convinced of the general in|fluence of the Stomach, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the State of a Per&s;on who labours under a difficult Dige&s;tion; the Powers are lo&s;t in a few minutes, a general unea&s;ine&s;s makes the weakne&s;s more in&s;upportable, the Organs of Sen&s;e are benumbed, the faculties of the Soul are exerci&s;ed very imperfectly, the Memory, and particularly the Imagination, &s;eems to be annihilated; in a word, nothing makes a &s;en&s;ible Man &s;o much re&s;emble an Idiot, as the difficulty of Dige&s;tion. This Ob&s;ervation equally points out to us, that of all Di&s;orders, there are none which more quickly affect the Soul, than tho&s;e of the Nervous Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>There is one general precaution, which is, to refrain from all Liquors in great quanti|ties; they weaken Dige&s;tion, by relaxing the Stomach, drowning the dege&s;tive Juices, and by precipitating the Aliments before they are dige&s;ted: they relax all the parts, di&s;&s;olve the humours, excite making Water, or draining
<PB N="27" REF="29">Sweats. I have &s;een di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by Weakne&s;s con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed without any remedy, but the mere retrenching of the quantity of Liquor the Patient u&s;ually Drunk.</P>
<P>We know, that an unnatural State of the Nerves of the Stomach may either produc a craving or an aver&s;ion to food; that low Spirits and Melancholy often proceed from that cau&s;e: nor is it to be doubted, that when the Nerves of the Stomach are, for cer|tain cau&s;es, affected in a manner &s;omewhat different, an indifference for food, a weak Dige&s;tion, a languor and coldne&s;s, a &s;low Pul&s;e, and wa&s;ting, may be the con&s;equences. By proper food, the Nerves of the Stomach are gratefully &s;timulated, and the whole Body is thence enlivened and &s;trengthened; &s;o that, be&s;ides its u&s;e for nutrition, food in the &s;to|mach becomes, altogether nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome delicate Nervous People, for keeping up the &s;trength of the Body, and the due exerci&s;e of all its &s;uctions. The morbid affection of the Nerves of the Stomach, by &s;ympathy, impairs the Vigour and energy of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in Holy Write, <Q>"That where much is given, much will be required"</Q> May I pre&s;ume then to put a Que&s;tion, which I wi&s;h to do without giving offence to God or the world. How it has happened in all ages,
<PB N="28" REF="30">That men of the greate&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of Soul, &s;hould be endued with &s;uch delicate Nerves, as pervert the mental Faculties and prevent the Soul from exerting its noble&s;t Powers, to &s;hine and illuminate in contemplation of the Works of God?</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Section with Dr Chene's ob&s;ervation, in his Engli&s;h Malady, the reading of which, &s;trikes the Human Mind with a&s;to|ni&s;hment: <Q>"But of all the mi&s;eries that af|flicts human Life, (&s;ays that Eminent Phy|&s;ician) and which principally relate to the Body, in this Valley of Tears, I think Ner|vous di&s;orders, in their extreme and la&s;t Degree, beyond all compari&s;on the wor&s;t."</Q> It was the ob&s;ervation of a Great Man, that he had &s;een per&s;ons labouring under the Gout, Stone, Cancer and every other di&s;|order, which could tear the Human Ma|chine.

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Human Body is made up of &s;uch frail Materials, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de|cay, and often be put out of order.</P>
<P>We are not only &s;ubject to pain, and di&s;|ea&s;es; but al&s;o to Irregularities of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and Influence of the Weather; all which af|fect the Spirits, Intellects and Memory, &s;o as to render the &s;ame Per&s;on very different, at different times, in thinking, &s;peaking, and acting; as any one, who is not robu&s;tly in|&s;en&s;ible mu&s;t naturally di&s;cover from his own feelings, at one time or other. Con&s;idering its admirable Structure, the Number and ex|qui&s;ite finene&s;s of its movements, that in a healthy State, all its parts mu&s;t con&s;pire to perform their proper office, and that the lea&s;t failure generally occa&s;ions &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e; it appears matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that we are more than the tran&s;itory Beings of a Day.</P>
<P>In this frail and uncertain &s;tate, the human Sy&s;tem is &s;ubject to an Inclement Atmo|&s;phere without, and the violent Pa&s;&s;ions with|in,
<PB N="30" REF="32">it may &s;uffer from Intemperance in Diet, the advances of Age and the prevalence of Injurious Habits, &s;o as to render it more un|&s;table than the Weather-Gla&s;s, and in a per|petual &s;tate of change, from the Cradle to the Grave.</P>
<P>Well may human Life, thus &s;urrounded by a train of unavoidable dangers, and calamities be compared to a fleeting &s;hadow which ne|ver contiues in one &s;tay. Like an unballa&s;ted bark in a troubled Ocean, it becomes the &s;port of Winds and tides; and without the aid of Religion, Rea&s;on, and Philo&s;ophy, is in continual danger of being &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps, however, very few can properly be &s;aid to die of old age merely; for even the Life of Old Parr might probably have been &s;till prolonged, had he not changed his Air and manner of Living.</P>
<P>Here we may ob&s;erve, that by a kind of Fatal Nece&s;&s;ity, Animal Bodies are worn out and de&s;troyed by that very cau&s;e which con|&s;titutes the principles of Life, namely, the circulating power of the Blood; and con|&s;equently, that the number of years to which man may attain, will probably be in propor|tion to the Velocity of the Pul&s;e: If &s;o, it will then follow, that &s;uch a particular &s;tate of the Con&s;titution as produces the greate&s;t de|gree
<PB N="31" REF="33">of &s;trength and vigour in youth, is not mo&s;t likely to prolong Life, that tho&s;e of weak &s;olids, and delicate habits in their early &s;tate. grow old more &s;lowly than others; and if the Vi&s;cera is &s;ound, become for a time, more &s;trong and Healthy from the effect of Age</P>
<P>The di&s;orders produced by the efforts of the mind fall &s;oone&s;t upon &s;uch as are ince&s;|&s;antly engaged in the contemplation of one object&punc; <Q>"Study (&s;ays Mr Rou&s;&s;eau) makes men tender, weakens their Con&s;titution, and when once the Body has lo&s;t its pow|ers, tho&s;e of the &s;oul are not ea&s;ily pre&s;er|ved.

<P>The whole Body becomes hard in proce&s;s of time, and old age it&s;elf is a general indu|ration. In labouring Men, tho&s;e parts mo&s;t u&s;ed in their re&s;pective employmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s grow callous; in men of Letters, the Brain it&s;elf is attacked in this manner. They become in|capable of connecting ideas, and grow old much before their time.</P>
<P>In Children the Brain is too &s;oft in old Per&s;ons too hard, and in the two extremes it is equally unfit to communicate the O&s;cillati|ons
<PB N="32" REF="34">exerted by thinking. Galen has rightly ob&s;erved, that our memory fails fir&s;t, and forebodes the weakening of our rea&s;on The Nerves are not the only parts affected by deep thinking, for, as Gunzius has ob&s;erved, the wearine&s;s of the eyes is alone &s;ufficient to produce Nervous di&s;ea&s;es, There is no one but mu&s;t have experienced, as I have often done, how much the head is weakened by long attention of the &s;ight. If after a Fever or other Indi&s;po&s;ition, it &s;hould happen to me, before my &s;trength is well recruited to fix my eyes for a long time on any Object, I am immediately &s;eized with Giddine&s;s, &s;ick|ne&s;s at &s;tomach, and my whole Body &s;uffers a painful Sen&s;ation of being fatigued and ex|hau&s;ted</P>
<P>If &s;uch are the Injuries brought on the Con&s;titution by irregularity and exce&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;ions, it ought to be the care of every Rational Being, to guard again&s;t their in&s;ults, and to oppo&s;e their Effects with becoming re&s;olution, and a Virtuous Re&s;ignation to the Will of Providence.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery are the Lights and Shades which fill up the out-lines in the Por|trait of Human Life Every Man naturally endeavours to attain the one, and avoid the other; but by very different means, which are often di&s;proportioned to that end.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="35">
<P>We frequently deceive our&s;elves, both in the pur&s;uit and enjoyment of our wi&s;hes. Extravagance of Hope often ends in di&s;ap|pointment; and even a con&s;tant Series of plea&s;urable Events will at la&s;t lo&s;e their power. To give them true reli&s;h, and make them la&s;ting, the mind mu&s;t refer to &s;ome former painful &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Thus a Per&s;on who always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d Health, is &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of its value; but when lo&s;t, let it again return, and he will ble&s;s the means which re&s;tored it. None enjoy Riches &s;o much as tho&s;e who have been at great pains to attain them: He who always was affluent, has no competent idea of Indigence, to con|tra&s;t &s;uch a State, or exalt his enjoyment. Were, our exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures too la&s;ting, they would lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s on the vital powers of the Body, as would &s;oon wear it out. Every extreme, therefore, corrects it&s;elf; and every Evil works its own cure.</P>
<P>If the violent Pa&s;&s;ions harrow up the Soul, and di&s;turb its union with the Body, a Con|&s;cience pure and uncorrupted, the ine&s;tima|ble reward of Virtue, will be&s;t reconcile them to each other, and cau&s;e them to dwell in harmony: That will always &s;peak peace to the Mind, whatever the World may &s;ay, and &s;hield it from the impotent attacks of &s;lander and abu&s;e. Whoever is over &s;olicitous about
<PB N="34" REF="36">Cen&s;ure, Fame, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of temporal Enjoyments&punc; will &s;eldom find repo&s;e: an un|gratious look from his &s;uperiors, or unmerit|ed in&s;olence from tho&s;e below him, will vex and di&s;compo&s;e him. If he is anxious for long life; a Coffin or &s;hroud, the apparatus of Death, will alarm and appal his &s;en&s;es; whil&s;t he who di&s;pen&s;es with unavoidable ills with a Philo&s;phic indifference, who is neither weary of living or affraid to die, will find within him&s;elf an inexpre&s;&s;ible, and perpetual calm.</P>
<P>By giving way to &s;orrow, or anger, they at la&s;t become habitual and reign triumphant: In a word, the government of the pa&s;&s;ions is as e&s;&s;ential towards preventing di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, as Temperance contributes to hinder them attacking the Body.</P>
<P>That man ought to be deemed riche&s;t, who is the happie&s;t; and he is the mo&s;t like|ly to become &s;o, who, with a virtuous re&s;ig|nation is prepared for the unavoidable evils which fle&s;h is heir to; who expo&s;tulates with the folly and extravagance of his own de&s;ires, and though a hard ta&s;k, at la&s;t convinces him|&s;elf that what he likes be&s;t. is not always be&s;t for him; who pre&s;erves at all times, a decent equality of mind, is not arrogantly elated with the delu&s;ive &s;miles of Pro&s;perity, nor &s;ervily ca&s;t down by the &s;urly vi&s;age of Mi&s;|fortune.</P>

<P>Though the Soul has a power over the in|voluntary motions of the Body, in a healthy &s;tate; yet when the Body is di&s;ea&s;ed or im|perfectly formed, the operation of the Soul then is irregular.</P>
<P>Even the &s;trength of the Con&s;titution is it&s;elf dangerous. Young people of excel|lent Con&s;titutions, apply them&s;elves to &s;tudy with indefatigable indu&s;try; the powerful action of the Soul increa&s;es that of the Organs, and they are attacked with inflam|matory di&s;ea&s;es, the consequence of irri|tation long kept up in vigorous habits. Sometimes they expire in the fir&s;t attack; more commonly they get the better of that; and if they find them&s;elves perfectly re|covered, their con&s;titution recovering its vigour, they give them&s;elves up again to the &s;ame labours, and relap&s;e into the &s;ame di&s;|orders. There are frequent in&s;tances of ro|bu&s;t young men clo&s;e applying to &s;tudy&punc; who are attacked with inflammatory fevers every
<PB N="36" REF="38">year; at la&s;t, in proce&s;s of time, being worn out by the&s;e attacks and by their labours, they lo&s;e their &s;trength, and are &s;eized with con|&s;umptive di&s;ea&s;es, again&s;t which they are no longer able to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Health is frequently de&s;troyed by exce&s;&s;ive devotion. An Author has collected &s;everal intere&s;ting ob&s;ervations on this head, in which devout Melancholy is well delineated; its &s;ymptoms are very unaccountable, alarming, and grievous; and there are few practitioners who have not had opportunities of &s;eeing &s;ome &s;hocking in&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e. The greatne&s;s and excellence of the object, and the &s;atisfaction the Soul experiences in giv|ing it&s;elf up to the contemplation of the Al|mighty, excites too lively a Sen&s;ation, and produces in the Brain, attention too violent and too continual, to be &s;upported for a long time together without Injury; it &s;oon throws the &s;oul into fanatical madne&s;s, and exhau&s;ts the Body. Some mo&s;t amiable young Per|&s;ons, led away by an erronious Sy&s;tem, fade and fall into decay, neglecting the duties of their calling, in order to give their thoughts up wholly to the &s;upreme Author of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">ng, who could not have been more pro|perly glorified than by a &s;trict Attention to tho&s;e duties. A Student is &s;till regrated, One of the greate&s;t abilities, born with &s;trong
<PB N="37" REF="39">powers of the mind, who&s;e candour and o|ther Virtues would have been an acqui&s;ition to the Church; But who unfortunately de|voted him&s;elf to a &s;ect, of which he &s;oon was the victim, the powers of his Body decaying as fa&s;t as his mind became more zealou&s;ly in|flamed.</P>
<P>Sometimes even the mo&s;t lucky thoughts ari&s;e in the mid&s;t of recreation. One of the greate&s;t Geniu&s;es of our age computed his immortal works walking about in the Coun|try. The Soul unfolds it&s;elf in open Air, but is impri&s;oned within the confined walls of a Study; it is elevated by the fragrance of Flowers, depre&s;&s;ed by the &s;mell of a Lamp. Plutarch's compari&s;on on this &s;ubject is very ju&s;t and excellent: "A little water," (&s;ays he,) "nouri&s;hes and &s;trengthens "Plants; and a greater quantity &s;tifles them." Thus it is with the mind; moderate labour is its food; exce&s;&s;ive labour de&s;troys it. When activity was mentioned as the &s;econd cau&s;e of the di&s;orders here treated of, exerci&s;e was certainly repre&s;ented at the &s;ame time, as one of the mo&s;t powerful pre&s;ervatives and re|&s;torers of the health of the Learned.</P>
<P>In the foregoing article, the advantages of open air have been con&s;idered, the&s;e are greatly enhanced, if accompanied with &s;ome degree of motion. The Learned in general,
<PB N="38" REF="40">are not &s;ufficiently convinced of the influence the Body has on the Soul, although it was well known to our greate&s;t men, who have been &s;en&s;ible that the Mind was &s;ubject to the powers of Phy&s;ic as well as the Body, <Q>"The Soul, &s;ays Des Cartes, is &s;o much influenc|ed by the Con&s;titution, and the State of the Bodily Organs, that if it were po&s;&s;ible to find out a method of encrea&s;ing our pe|netration, it &s;hould certainly be &s;ought for in Medicine."</Q> Walking alone is very be|neficial, but not quite &s;ufficient; and it can|not be too much recommended to them to ride out frequently on Hor&s;e-back; this kind of exerci&s;e is of u&s;e to the Head, the Brea&s;t, and the Vi&s;cera of the lower Belly, e&s;pecially by preventing or di&s;pelling their ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The hypocondriac di&s;ea&s;e may al&s;o be reckoned among the Evils learned Men are expo&s;ed to, from that kind of inactive life, which di&s;turbing the circulation in the abdo|dominal Vi&s;cera, produces ob&s;tructions in them. This di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;e generally attacks the In|dolent, the Luxurious, the Unfortunate, and the Studious. Men of a Melancholy tem|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rament&punc; who&s;e minds are capable of great Attention, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are not ea&s;ily moved, are in the advanced periods of Life, mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e. It may rather be called a complication of Maladies, than a
<PB N="39" REF="41">&s;ingle one. To what a wretched condition are the be&s;t of Men often reduced by it! Their &s;trength and appetite fail; a perpetual gloom hangs over their minds; they live in the con&s;tant dread of death, and are continu|ally in &s;earch of relief from Medicine, where, alas! it is not to be found.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e mo&s;t liable to this Di&s;ea&s;e, are the Virtuous, the Valiant, the Brave, and tho&s;e of an enlarged under&s;tanding, whom it would be the intere&s;t of the world to wi&s;h, they were free from that and every other illne&s;s; and except for that alloy, they would have too large a &s;hare of human happine&s;s. To this we owe the irrepareable lo&s;s of Doctor Young, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t approved Men that have appeared among us.</P>
<P>Hypochandriac per&s;ons ought never to fa&s;t long, and their food &s;hould be &s;olid and nouri&s;hing, all ace&s;cent and windy vegetables are to be avoided. Fle&s;h meats agree be&s;t with them, and their drink &s;hould be old Cla|ret or generous Madeira.</P>
<P>In all per&s;ons afflicted with Nervous di&s;or|ders, there is a great, delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility of the whole Nervous Sy&s;tem, and an un|common degree of weakne&s;s of the Organs of dige&s;tion. The&s;e may be either natural or acquired. When owing to a defect in the
<PB N="40" REF="42">Con&s;titution, they are hardly to be removed; but may be mitigated by proper care.</P>
<P>But Nervous Affections ari&s;e more fre|quently from cau&s;es which it is, in a great mea&s;ure, in our power to avoid, than from Di&s;ea&s;es, or any Original fault in the Con&s;ti|tution. Exce&s;&s;ive grief. inten&s;e Study, im|proper diet, and neglect of Exerci&s;e, are the great Sources of this exten&s;ive Cla&s;s of di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Grief indulged de&s;troys the appetite and dige&s;tion depre&s;&s;es the &s;pirits. and induces an univer&s;al relaxation and debility of the whole Sy&s;tem. In&s;tances of this are daily to be &s;een. The lo&s;s of a relation, or any other misfor|tune in Life, is often &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion the mo&s;t complicated &s;eries of Nervous &s;ymp|toms Such misfortunes indeed are not to be avoided, but &s;urely their effects, by a vigor|ous and proper exertion of the mind, might be renderd le&s;s hurtful. The effects of in|ten&s;e Study are pretty &s;imilar to tho&s;e occa&s;i|oned by Grief. It preys upon the Animal Spirits, and de&s;troys the appetite and dige&s;ti|on To prevent the&s;e effects, &s;tudious Per&s;ons ought, according to the Poet, O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">oy with their Books. They &s;hould never Study too long at a time; nor attend long to one particular Subject, e&s;pecially if it be of a &s;erious nature. They ought likewi&s;e to be attentive to their
<PB N="41" REF="43">po&s;ture, and &s;hould take care frequently to unbend their minds by mu&s;ic, diver&s;ions, or agreeable Company.</P>
<P>With regard to Diet, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that Nervous di&s;ea&s;es may be occa&s;ioned either by exce&s;s or inanition, both the&s;e extre|mes hurt dige&s;tion, and vitiate the humours.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t general cau&s;e of Nervous dis|orders is Indolence. The active and laborious are &s;eldom troubled with them They are re&s;erved for the Children of ea&s;e and afflu|ence, who generally feel their keene&s;t force. All I &s;hall &s;ay to &s;uch Per&s;ons is, that the means of prevention and cure are both in their own power. If the Con&s;titution of hu|man nature be &s;uch, that man mu&s;t either labour or &s;uffer di&s;ea&s;es. &s;urely, no individual has any right to expect an exemption from the general rule.</P>
<P>If the &s;tomach is bad, either naturally or from errors in diet, this Organ will be affected by the exerci&s;e of the mind, while the Nerves &s;hall remain in a &s;ound &s;tate; on the contrary, if the Nervous Sy&s;tem is weak, and the Sto|mach &s;trong, Nervous di&s;ea&s;es of great im|portance, will be brought on before the Sto|mach is Injured.</P>
<P>A fit of Illne&s;s, undige&s;ted food, or any &s;imilar cau&s;e often occa&s;ions broken uncon|nected dreams, and prevents our receiving the
<PB N="42" REF="44">ari&s;ing from &s;ound &s;leep; the rea&s;on of which probably is, the fermentation and di&s;cordance of the nutritive juices&punc; incapacitating our &s;en&s;es or organs (thro' which the &s;oul is empowred to act) from being in a perfect &s;tate of re&s;t, the &s;oul mu&s;t consequently partake of that irregular and unconnected quality, by which the bodily organs are at that juncture actuated: But in Death the ca&s;e is quite re|ver&s;ed; the Soul, in&s;tead of being Clogg'd up and embarra&s;&s;ed by Bodily impediments is ab&s;olutely and entirely freed from them; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e it is longer confined to Nerves and Arteries, which there is no po&s;&s;i|bility of its ever making any further u&s;e of, &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition mu&s;t be ridiculous: So that in &s;leep the Soul's &s;ituation is directly contrary to what it mu&s;t be in death; in the fir&s;t ca&s;e it is by material influence pre|vented from exerting its powers, whereas in Death, that is, on its enlargement from its Material body it finds it&s;elf for the fir&s;t time at full Liberty, and in full power of expanding and exerting them to the ut|mo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is evident that Virtue and Vice are not Con&s;titutional, and dependent on any parti|cular habit of Body, and tho' our material part, has an influence over the &s;oul, in regard to the exertion of its Faculties, yet that influ|ence,
<PB N="43" REF="45">extends only to the enlarging or con|tracting our intellectual faculties, and not to our making a good or ill u&s;e of tho&s;e facul|ties, that re&s;t &s;olely in Our&s;elves, and if we make a wrong u&s;e of that power; if we un|naturalize our&s;elves, as I may &s;ay, by deviat|ing from the Paths of Virtue, whom are we to blame? The Deity who has formed us as we &s;hould be, or our&s;elves, who with an un|grateful hand, rejected the opportunity he has given us of attaining virtue, and in con&s;e|quence, eternal felicity?</P>
<P>Are we not a&s;&s;ured too, by the Deity, that according to our different abilities, &s;ituation, various contingencies &amp;c we &s;hall hereafter be judged? Our actions will be &s;crutaniz'd in proportion to the talents entru&s;ted to us, and according to the opportunities and incitements we have had, to make u&s;e of them and not taken in that &s;uperficial light, mor|tals look on them: It is not tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t &s;hare of, but tho&s;e who make the be&s;t u&s;e of their moral and intellectual powers, who will be regarded hereafter; ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s are the Deity's Attributes, and by them we are hereafter to be judged: As to Idiots, &amp;c who (like the Brute Creation) are under the dominion of matter, at lea&s;t, have as little power of exerting their facul|ties, the Deity's Ju&s;tice will hardly expect
<PB N="44" REF="46">from them duties, which it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould perform. What u&s;e they and many more beings are of in the Creation we know not; but let us not, &s;hort &s;ighted as we are, for that rea&s;on arraign Divine wi&s;dom: We are &s;ure every part of the Creation was or|dain'd for &s;ome wi&s;e purpo&s;e, tho' to what end we are perhaps ignorant; And in regard to the diversity of power, talents, &amp;c. which we ob&s;erve among men, &s;o far from being a blemi&s;h, they are a great pro&s; of the Deity's Wi&s;dom: In&s;tead of their being the cau&s;e of confu&s;ion it is on that, the link which &s;up|ports all, chiefly depends: was it otherways, half the omnipotent's Power and goodne&s;s on earth, would have been in vain.</P>
<P>We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, That Death, (which is indeed but the Souls Birth) in&s;tead of being a gloomy Me&s;&s;enger, is in reality our be&s;t Friend, &s;ince by his means we &s;hall be freed from the fetters of the fle&s;h, and in|troduced into a &s;tate of freedom, Knowledge, and (I hope) Happine&s;s, where our intellect|ual Powers will have full &s;cope: where we &s;hall he all Ethereal Sen&s;e, and capable of in|numerable Joys which in our pre&s;ent &s;tate we can have no conception of: as Swans are &s;aid to &s;ing melodiou&s;ly before Death, from an in|&s;tinct of &s;ome extraordinary Good approach|ing, &s;o &s;hould good men rejoice on their
<PB N="45" REF="47">elinqui&s;hing this mortal State: let us con&s;ider what happine&s;s even in this life the contemp|lation of an eternity produces! To indulge in the hopes of meeting again with our long-lo&s;t be&s;t beloved Friends; of living in intimacy and conver&s;ing with, not only the He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oes and Philo&s;ophers of all ages, but with Angels and other &s;uperior Beings; of indulging the amiable curio&s;ity of &s;earching into and ad|miring the works of the Deity, thro' the im|men&s;ity of the creation, where infinite variety mu&s;t prove an infinite fund of un&s;peakable, in&s;atiable, and ever encrea&s;ing happine&s;s; mu&s;t not reflections like the&s;e animate our Spirits and &s;timulate us to virtue? I own I often in|dulge the thought, and am never &s;o happy as when I am thus, as it were, anticipating eter|nity; be&s;ides, nothing contributes &s;o much to cheerfulne&s;s, Religion, Humanity and all the &s;ocial virtues, as the contemplation and hopes of a futurity; whereas to the contrary opinion, is ever united a melancholy which rankles within us, which preys upon our Spi|rits, and which by dive&s;ting us or all fears of a future Judgment, encourages Vice; and too often induces us to give &s;uch a loo&s;e to our pa&s;&s;ions as makes us incapable of Happine&s;s either in this world, or the world to come.</P>
<P>And for the Good and Virtuous, the cau&s;e of their Immortality is continually
<PB N="46" REF="48">crea&s;ing even in this world: The longer they exi&s;t, the more they improve in Knowledge and virtue and con&s;equently, the more they merit an Eternity. We might as well &s;uppo&s;e, the Deity &s;hould annihilate Angels, and other &s;uperior Beings, as the Souls of Virtuous Men. When we mo&s;t plea&s;e him, to imagine we &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;e|verely puni&s;hed by him, were ab&s;urd; and &s;urely to the virtuous and happy, Annihilation mu&s;t be the mo&s;t dreadful of Puni&s;hments. The Immateriality of the Soul implies too, that it is a Sub&s;tance incorruptible and inva|riable and con&s;equently eternal, unle&s;s it &s;hall plea&s;e the Deity to annihilate it; and can we &s;uppo&s;e, that Truth and Goodne&s;s, which are emanations from the Divine Creator, will not eternally exi&s;t?</P>
<P>Every part of the Creation evinces, in the mo&s;t &s;triking characters, the Exi&s;tence of a Deity; and becau&s;e we are not acquainted with the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of the Deity, &s;hall we for that rea&s;on alone, doubt there is a Deity?</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame in all immaterial &s;ub|&s;tances; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for us to be admit|ted to a nearer intimacy with them, while we are confined to this bodily pri&s;on, where, as I before ob&s;erved, we can have no di&s;tinct idea
<PB N="47" REF="49">of any thing but what is material, &s;ince all our perceptions are the effects of material impul&s;|es, and conveyed through material Organs to the Soul. The human under&s;tanding is limited to every human boundaries How many things are there, even in the ma|terial Creation, which &s;eem my&s;terious, and are kept from us? Yet this &s;hould not give us the lea&s;t unea&s;iness, &s;ince what|ever is available to our happine&s;s here, or hereafter, is laid open to us. The knowledge of a Deity, and the Soul's exi&s;tence, are truths ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make us happy and virtuous.</P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving, That we are a&s;&s;ured in Scripture, &mdash;<Q>"Angels and other &s;piritual Beings, neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage:"</Q> They all have one common Parent, The Almighty.</P>
<P>Our Bodies, like all other material &s;y&s;tems are not de&s;igned for eternal duration, are ever variable, and &s;o ordered, as to &s;tand in need of daily recruits of Food, Sleep, &amp;c.: During our &s;leep, a &s;woon, or any &s;imilar cau&s;e, the Soul being embarra&s;&s;ed and clogged up, as it were, is in a &s;tate of Deliquium at lea&s;t, if it does think, its actions are &s;o incon|gruous, as not to be traced in our waking hours notwith&s;tanding which, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that the Soul is in reality more defective then,
<PB N="48" REF="50">than at another time; but the Organs, thro' which it is obliged to act, being ob&s;tructed, its faculties are con&s;equently impeded. If we lo&s;e our Eye-fight Or hearing, the Soul is not in the lea&s;t maimed thereby, it has but lo&s;t its In&s;trument or Bodily Organ, its original power is &s;till the &s;ame; and were our optical or auditory Organs reduced to order, the Soul would again re-exert its u&s;ual Faculties.</P>
<P><Q>"Thus," as an Author ob&s;erves, the Mu&s;ician cannot, if his In&s;trument be di&s;|order'd, bring forth any harmony; his &s;kill, neverthele&s;s, remains; which, on the In&s;trument's being re-put in order, he again exhibits."</Q> Idioti&s;m, Forgetfulne&s;s, Dot|age, &amp;c. are not Weakne&s;&s;es of the Soul, but of the Sen&s;es; and we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, our Immaterial Principle, in &s;uch ca&s;es, lo&s;es its fa|culties, more than the Sun lo&s;es his meridian brightne&s;s, when hid from us, by dark clouds intervening. Thus, during Sleep, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the refre&s;hment of our Bodily part, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, there is &s;uch a relaxation of our material Organs, that our whole Sy&s;tem becomes too languid for the Soul to be capable of exerting its Active fa|culties; but when the Body is recruited with proper &s;trength, the Soul recovers its pri&s;tine power; it again dictates to, and governs the
<PB N="49" REF="51" MS="y">Body, and we may perceive it is the &s;ame thinking Principle, the very &s;ame Soul that actuated us before Sleep. Matter cannot dive&s;t the Soul of its faculties, though it can render it impo&s;&s;ible for it to exert them upon the Body; which may be di&s;ordered &s;o, as not to be directed by it. The Soul's Faculties then are not annihilated, but &s;u&s;pended from Action: or to &s;peak more properly, are wrap|ped up in it&s;elf. A Being may undoubtedly exi&s;t, without giving appearance of its exi&s;t|ence. The Soul, therefore, may exi&s;t, with|out giving &s;igns of its exi&s;tence, or affecting Matter, &s;o as to be con&s;cious of its own exi&s;t|ence: as in &s;leep, without dreaming, it re|mains the &s;ame invariable e&s;&s;ence; though the Indi&s;po&s;ition of the Bodily Organs renders it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;play tho&s;e faculties, from whence thought and reflection come.</P>
<P>The Soul h impa&s;&s;ible, con&s;equently in|capable of change: all the changes that hap|pen to an individual, ari&s;e from the different affections of the Bodily Organs. The Soul of a new-born Child is the &s;ame as that of an Old Man; and that of a Fool, as that of a Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>The Bodily Organs, on Which the opera|tions of the Soul depend, greatly vary; by which, the exerci&s;e of its Faculties are pro|portionably le&s;&s;ened or improved: but it's
<PB N="50" REF="52">particular exi&s;tence, faculties and powers re|main the &s;ame, impa&s;&s;ible to the Laws of Matter and Motion. The difference between the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t abject, and the highe&s;t and mo&s;t elevated natural capacity, depends upon the In&s;truments by which the Soul acts, and is affected; which &s;eem to us to alter its operations. The cau&s;e is in the Material Or|gans, which make repre&s;entations of its oper|ation, according to their ju&s;t or imperfect Mechani&s;m. If the Bodily Organs happen to be perfectly Organized, and exactly modu|lated to receive and convey to the Sen&s;orium or Seat of the Soul, the ideas of Objects, with a proper impul&s;e, then it exerts its faculties in a rea&s;onable manner: the Sen&s;es receive a ju&s;t or &s;ufficient degree of impul&s;e from the Objects; which impul&s;e the Organs convey, in a ju&s;t and &s;ufficient degree, which excites in the Soul, the di&s;tinct idea of the object.</P>
<P>The brighte&s;t Wits, the mo&s;t exalted Un|der&s;tandings, may be reduced to a level with the mo&s;t abject, &s;tupid, and unintelligent Fool. By the Mechanical Affections of Mat|ter and Motion, we often &s;ee a Man of the brighte&s;t parts, and mo&s;t enlarged under|&s;tanding, who hath penetrated into the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of nature, de&s;poiled of all his Wi&s;dom and noble endowments, by the tyranny of a violent Nervous Fever, &amp;c. Thus we behold
<PB N="51" REF="53">him now dive&s;ted of the exerci&s;e of his Fa|culties. But can we &s;uppo&s;e this change made in the Soul it&s;elf? No: certainly it remains the &s;ame, and differs not from what it was before. Recover him from the Fever, &amp;c. and remove the impediment it hath thrown upon the Organs of the Sen&s;es, and the ex|erci&s;e of all the Faculties of the Soul returns; his Parts brighten, his under&s;tanding revives, and, in &s;hort, he becomes in every re&s;pect, the &s;ame amiable Per&s;on as he was, before the Fever, &amp;c &s;eized him.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that the Bodily Organs may be &s;o di&s;order'd, or the Stimulus, applied to them, &s;o great, as to put it out of the Soul's power to &s;u&s;pend or contract them; and tho' it is the &s;ource of all motion, both voluntary and involuntary, yet it may be reduced to an Inactive pa&s;&s;ive State, or forced into involun|tary Action.</P>
<P>Though all voluntary Motion proceeds from the immediate influence of the Soul, yet &s;ome of the voluntary motions, by the force of cu&s;tom and habit, come at length to be performed with little or no attention of the Soul, tho' it has full power to begin or &s;top the Motion when it plea&s;es. Thus a Man may Walk, and not be &s;en&s;ible of it; have an Object before him, without &s;eeing it; and put his hand to a Thing, without feeling
<PB N="52" REF="54">it; becau&s;e he is intent upon &s;omething el&s;e, therefore overlooks the&s;e &s;maller &s;en&s;ations; and the&s;e voluntary motions are, in &s;ome degree, mechanically performed.</P>
<P>I believe it will be allowed, that our Ideas or thoughts are immaterial; that is, are not bodily &s;ub&s;tances. Who ever thought there was any thing corporeal in a Judgement, a Doubt, &amp;c? If our Thoughts are corporeal, where could they be lodged? How infinitely complicated and extended mu&s;t that material Soul be, to be able to contain tho&s;e immen&s;e volumes of learning, which &s;ome Men have trea&s;ured up in their Souls.</P>
<P>The large &s;ize, the wonderful texture, great care and &s;ecurity, the God of Nature has employed about the Brain, make it high|ly probable, that it is de&s;igned for the noble&s;t u&s;es:&mdash;the Temple, Tabernacle, or Dwelling Hou&s;e of That <HI>Immaterial Being,</HI> That <HI>Im|mortal Gue&s;t,</HI> I hat That <HI>Spark of the Deity,</HI> That <HI>Breath of Life,</HI> THE LIVING SOUL or MAN.</P>
<P>Every thing we &s;ay or do, our every Action and Thought, proves and a&s;certains the rea|lity of the Soul: the very doubting its Exi&s;t|ence, is a &s;trong proof of it. Whence pro|ceeds the Power of Doubting? It is evident, that the particles of matter of which our Bodies are formed were not long &s;ince life|le&s;s
<PB N="53" REF="55">vegitative Particles, for which we are in|debted to the Fields that nouri&s;h'd and pro|duced them, and which are but tran&s;planted, as it were, into another &s;oil: The&s;e particles of matter, tho' differently modified and form|ed into a mo&s;t &s;urprizing piece of mechani&s;m, are in reality (as to their original power and nature) the &s;ame, and as incapable of thought, &s;elf motion &amp;c. as when growing in the Field, Matter, it is true, by a proper modification, may become a fit dwelling for Thinking Being; what then &s;hall we call that Principle within us which doubts, which reflects, which dictates to us, and &s;ways us in every Action of Life? What is it that endows us with the power of &s;elf-motion, which enables to re|collect pa&s;t actions, to look forward into fu|turity, and in a manner, to foretel future con&s;equences? It is certainly &s;omewhat of a Different nature from the lifele&s;s particles of which our Bodies are formed: it is &s;ome|what, which, tho' we cannot rightly define, we are &s;ure is &s;omewhat; and this it is we call, THE SOUL.</P>
<P>While the Body is kept in order, the Soul is ea&s;y; when it is not, the Soul is in pain. When the functions of the Body cea&s;e, the Soul quits the A&s;&s;ociation, but exi&s;ts in a &s;e|parate &s;tate. For as every particle of the body (however transformed) will remain after the
<PB N="54" REF="56">&s;eparation, &s;o will the Soul al&s;o; for whatever has once received a Being from God, cannot cea&s;e to be without his interpo&s;ition. We are told in Scripture, That man is made after God's own Image. Now, as the Deity cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed a material Being, what can it imply but that our Being like him, is an Immate|rial Immortal &s;ub&s;tance, endowed with Rea|&s;on, Reflection, and the power of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between good and evil &amp;c It is, it mu&s;t be owned a very bold Ea&s;tern Metaphor, as the difference and di&s;tance between us is &s;o Inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the Bli&s;s of Immortal Beings, we have while in this life, no ideas more ex|pre&s;&s;ive than tho&s;e which depend on the &s;en|&s;es of &s;eeing and hearing, which &s;en&s;es &s;eem principally de&s;igned for the &s;ervice of our immortal Part, and may be call'd vehicles for the Soul's Food, as tho&s;e of ta&s;ting, &s;melling and feeling, are de&s;igned purely for the Bo|dy's u&s;e. After Death, the Soul will doubt|le&s;s, be gifted with many powers and inlets to happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, which we at pre&s;ent can have no idea of.</P>
<P>It has been a received opinion in all ages, that immen&s;ity &s;warms with invi&s;ible imma|terial Beings, who are the Agents of Provi|dence, and witne&s;&s;es of our mo&s;t private ac|tions.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="57">
<P>The thought of our exi&s;tance terminating with this Life naturally checks the Soul in any generous pur&s;uit, contracts her views, and fixes them on temporary and &s;elfi&s;h ends; It dethrones the rea&s;on, extingui&s;hes all noble and heroic Sentiments; encourages Lu&s;t, Fraud, Violence, and all kind of Vice, by which, a Man may wickedly make his For|tune, or indulge a plea&s;ure without fear of temporal damage, either in Reputation, Health, or Fortune: In &s;hort, the inward compunctions of a wicked, as well as the joys of an upright mind, are grafted on the A&s;|&s;urance of another &s;tate.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;e the natural Hopes and fears of men; hence &s;pring the means of future rewards, and appearing plea&s;ing to the Deity, tho' per&s;ecuted in this world, and likewi&s;e the inward &s;tings of Con&s;cience and dread of pu|ni&s;hment attending pro&s;perous Vice, tho' hid from Human eyes.</P>
<P>As it is probable that there may be differ|ent Degrees of happine&s;s for Souls, in pro|portion as they have been more or le&s;s per|fect, it is as probable too, that in tho&s;e &s;tati|ons, Souls will be furni&s;hed with opportuni|ties of eternally improving in Virtue and knowlege, and con&s;equently of increa&s;ing in happine&s;s; notwith&s;tanding, which gradation to perfection, they mo&s;t ever remain infinite|ly
<PB N="56" REF="58">di&s;tant from the Deity, who is Perfection it&s;elf.</P>

<P>O MAN, greatly beloved by thy Creator! The Darling of Providence thou art di&s;tingui&s;hed by his goodne&s;s; di&s;tingui&s;h thy&s;elf al&s;o by thy one undivided aim to glo|rify him, who has been at &s;o much expence to gratify thee;&mdash;while all the&s;e inferior creatures in &s;ilent eloquence declare the glory of God, do thou lend them thy tongue, be thou the High Prie&s;t of the mute Creation; let their Prai&s;e become vocal in thy &s;ongs. Adore the &s;upreme Benefactor, for the ble&s;|&s;ings he &s;howers down upon every order of beings; adore him for numberle&s;s mercies which are appropriated to thy&s;elf: But above all, adore him for that Noble gift of a Ration|al and immortal Soul.</P>
<P>A celebrated modern Author has ele|gantly expre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject.</P>
<Q><P>"O ye timerous Souls, that are terrified at the found of the pa&s;&s;ing Bell, That turn pale at the fight of an opened Grave, and can &s;carce behold a Coffin or a Skull, without a &s;huddering horror."</P>
<PB N="57" REF="59">
<P>"O Eternity! Eternity! how are our bolde&s;t; our &s;tronge&s;t thoughts lo&s;t and overwhelmed in thee! Who can &s;et land-marks to limit thy dimen&s;ions, or find Plumbers to fathom thy depths? Arethmeticians have figures to compute all the progre&s;&s;ions of time; A&s;tro|nomers have in&s;truments to calculate the di|&s;tances of the Plannets; but what numbers can &s;tate, what Lines gauge, the lengths and breadths of Eternity? "It is higher than Heaven, what can&s;t thou do? deeper than Hell, what can&s;t thou know? The mea&s;ure thereof is longer than the earth, broader than the &s;ea" My&s;terious, mighty exi&s;t|ence! a Sum not to be le&s;&s;ened by the large&s;t deductions! an extent not to be contracted by all po&s;&s;ible diminutions! none can truly &s;ay, after the mo&s;t prodigious wa&s;te of ages, "So much of Eternity is gone:" for when millions of Centuries are elapfed, it is but ju&s;t commencing; and when millions more have run their ample round, it will not be nearer ending. Yea, when ages, numerous as the bloom of Spring; encrea&s;ed by the Herbage of Summer, both augmented by the Leaves of Autumn, and all multiplied by the drops of rain, which drown the Winter&mdash;when the&s;e, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and more&mdash;more than can be repre&s;ented by any &s;imilitude, or imagined by any conception&mdash;
<PB N="58" REF="60">when all the&s;e are revolved and fini&s;hed, Eter|nity, va&s;t, boundle&s;s amazing Eternity, will only be beginning.</P>
<P>"Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour till the <HI>Evening;</HI> but then his &s;trength fails, his Spirits fly, and he &s;tands in need not only of &s;ome re&s;pite from Toil, but of &s;ome kindly and &s;overeign refre&s;hment: what an admirable provi&s;ion for this purpo&s;e is &s;leep! &s;leep introduces a mo&s;t welcome vacation both for the Soul and Body: The exerci&s;es of the brain, and the labours of the hand, are at once di&s;continued; &s;o that the weary limbs repair their exhau&s;ted vigour, while the pen&s;ive thoughts drop their load of &s;orrows, and the bu&s;y ones re&s;t from the fatigue of application. Mo&s;t reviving Cordial! equally beneficial to our Animal and intellectual powers: It &s;upplies the fle&s;hly machine, and keeps all its nice Movements in a proper po&s;ture for ea&s;y play: It animates the think|ing faculties with fre&s;h Alacrity, and rekindles their Ardour for the Studies of the Dawn; without the&s;e enlivening recruits, how &s;oon would the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titution be wa&s;ted into a walking Skeleton, and the mo&s;t learn|ed Sage degenerate into a Hoary Idiot.</P>
<P>"How many of our Fellow creatures are, at this very In&s;tant, confined to the bed of lang|ui&s;hing, and complaining with that illu&s;trious
<PB N="59" REF="61">&s;ufferer of old, "Weari&s;ome nights are ap|pointed to me;" In&s;tead of indulging &s;oft repo&s;e, they are counting the tedious hours; telling every &s;triking Clock; or mea&s;uring the very moments by their throbbing Pul&s;e</P>
<P>"How many harra&s;&s;ed with pain, mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionately long to make &s;ome little truce with their agonies in peaceful &s;lumbers! How many &s;ick with di&s;quietude, and re&s;tle&s;s even, on their downy Pillows, would purcha&s;e this tran&s;ient oblivion of their woes almo&s;t at any rate! That which wealth cannot procure, which multitudes &s;igh for in vain, thy God has be&s;towed on thee, times out of number.</P>
<P>"But (&s;weet recollection! Ravi&s;hing Expec|tation!) the Songs of Saints in Light never admit a Pau&s;e for &s;adne&s;s: All Heaven will re&s;ound with the Melody of their Gratitude, and all Eternity echo to their Triumphant ac|clamations! The Hallelujahs of that world, and the harmonious Joy of it's Inhabitants, will be as la&s;ting as the Divine Perfections they celebrate. Come then, Holy Love, and tune my Heart! de&s;cend, cele&s;tial Fire, and touch my Tongue! that I may &s;tand ready to &s;trike up, and bear my part in that great Ho&s;anna, that everla&s;ting Hymn.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, ye flowery nations, ye mu&s;t all decay; and, indeed, could you add the &s;trength of an oak, or the &s;tability of a Py|ramid,
<PB N="60" REF="62">to all the delicacy of your texture, yet &s;hort, exceeding &s;hort, even then, would your Duration be; for I &s;ee, "that all things come to an end," The pillars of nature are tottering the foundations of the round world are falling away: "The heavens them&s;elves wax old like a garment." But, amid&s;t the&s;e views of general ruin, he is our refuge: this is our con&s;olation, "we know that our Re|deemer liveth."</P>
<P>"What a &s;triking argument is here for re|&s;ignation, unfeigned re&s;ignation, to all the di&s;po&s;als of providence! too often are our di&s;&s;atisfied thoughts apt to find fault with di|vine di&s;pen&s;ations. We tacitly arraign our makers conduct, or que&s;tion his kindne&s;s with regard to our&s;elves; we fancy our lot not &s;o comodiou&s;ly &s;ituated, or our conditi|on not &s;o happily circum&s;tanced, as if we had been placed in &s;ome other &s;tation of life.</P>
<P>"Be &s;till, then, thou unea&s;y mortal; know that God is unerringly wi&s;e; and be a&s;&s;ured that amid&s;t the greate&s;t multiplicity of beings He does not overlook thee. Thou art of far &s;uperior value in the e&s;timate of omnipo|tence than all the herbage of the field. If his &s;acred will ordains &s;ickne&s;s for thy por|tion, never dare to imagine that uninterrupt|ed health would be more advantageous. If he plea&s;es to withhold or carry away children
<PB N="61" REF="63">never pre&s;ume to conclude that thy happi|ne&s;s is bla&s;ted becau&s;e thy hopes of an en|crea&s;ing family are di&s;appointed. He that mar&s;halls all the &s;tarry ho&s;t, and &s;o accurately arranges every the meane&s;t &s;pecies of herbs, he orders all the peculiarities, all the changes of thy &s;tate with a vigilence that nothing can elude, with a goodne&s;s that endureth for e|ver. Bow thy head, therefore, in humble acquie&s;cence. Re&s;t &s;atisfied that "whatever is," by the appointment of Heaven, "is right, is be&s;t." Alas! how blind are mortals to future events! how unable to di&s;cern what is really good.</P>
<P>"Fools often account the life of the righte|ous but madne&s;s, and their end to be with|out honour, but they are number'd among the children of God; and their lot, their di|&s;tingui&s;h'd and eternal lot, is among the &s;aints. However, therefore, an undi&s;cerning world may de&s;pi&s;e, and a profane world vilify the truly religious, be this the Supreme, the invariable de&s;ire of my heart; "Let me live the life, and die the death of the righteous, Oh! let my latter end and future &s;tate be like theirs"</P>
<P>"But mo&s;t of all, in that tremendous day, when the heavens are rent a&s;&s;under, and wrapped up like a &s;croll; when the Almighty arm &s;hall arre&s;t the &s;un in his career, and
<PB N="62" REF="64">da&s;h to pieces the &s;tructure of the Univer&s;e; when the dead both &s;mall and great, &s;hall be gathered before the throne of glory, and the fate of all mankind &s;hall hang on the very point of a final irrever&s;ible deci&s;ion, then, Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS let us be owned by thee, and we &s;hall not be a&s;hamed, defended by thee, and we &s;hall not be afraid, O! may we at that awful, that unutterably important junc|ture, be covered with the wings of thy re|deeming love, and we &s;hall behold all the horrible convul&s;ions of expiring nature, with compo&s;ure, with comfort! we &s;hall even wel|come the di&s;&s;olution of all things, as the "times of refre&s;hing from the pre&s;ence of the LORD"</P></Q>
<P>Almighty God! Eternal Sovereign of the univer&s;e! who&s;e intelligence I perticipate by who&s;e power I am &s;u&s;tained, who&s;e exi&s;tence and attributes inve&s;tigate, who&s;e impul&s;es I &s;eem to feel ince&s;&s;antly prompting all my ac|tive powers to exert them&s;elves for univer&s;al good; to what &s;acred light, what unexpolr|ed &s;ource &s;hall I fly for information! How &s;hall I di&s;&s;ipate the gloomy uncertainty, who&s;e incumbent horror depre&s;&s;es all my being, and leaves its brighte&s;t hopes, its noble&s;t enter|prizes ab&s;orbed in endle&s;s and infinite de&s;pair? in vain am I told that, upon the mixture of
<PB N="63" REF="65">the Human character, depend the varieties of its fortune. Mi&s;ery is indeed the native con|&s;equente of vice; but why &s;hould vice take place in human nature? that error and mi&s;take are the re&s;ult of limited powers, I can ea&s;ily grant; but will it follow from thence, that uninterrupted peace and tranquility are incompatible with finite exi&s;tence? Is there no &s;uppo&s;able &s;tate, in which a mind, though cir|cum&s;cribed in its powers, and confined to a particular &s;phere of action, may be free from mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>God of nature! to who&s;e eyes the depth of Eternal wi&s;dom, the numberle&s;s vici&s;&s;itudes of infinite po&s;&s;ibility are obvious? why am I, and all the fraternal race of Men, born to the wretched inheritance of inexpiable guilt and immoveable wo? as images reflected by the poli&s;hed &s;urface of an opaque body, vani&s;h in &s;wift &s;uce&s;&s;ion, without impre&s;&s;ing any mark of their exi&s;tence, and leave the open expan&s;e unoccupied for others; &s;o &s;wiftly pa&s;s the fluctuating race of men, friends and allies robbed of half them&s;elves, di&s;&s;olved in tears and angui&s;h; whil&s;t expiring guilt en|tails on its connexions the dete&s;table heritage of &s;hame and execration.</P>
<P>Father of the human &s;pirit! amid&s;t the general confu&s;ion of things, in which the beams of thy gracious countenance alter|nately
<PB N="64" REF="66">&s;ink in impenetrable darkne&s;s, or e|merge in cele&s;tial glory to mortal Eyes; &s;till, &s;till my Soul per&s;wades me, not only of thy Exi&s;tence, but of its infinite and in&s;eparable perfections.</P>
