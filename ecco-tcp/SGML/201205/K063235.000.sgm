<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING for many Years la&s;t pa&s;t, advertis'd the World of an extraordinary <HI>Secret</HI> in <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> de&s;ign'd both by Na|ture and Art for the Publick Good; and propos'd as often likewi&s;e, not only to re|lieve, but al&s;o perfectly cure all Per&s;ons what&s;oever afflicted with any <HI>Scrophulous Di&s;ea&s;es, Strumous Tumors,</HI> or <HI>Malig|nant Ulcers;</HI> either in the <HI>Glands,</HI> or any other parts of the Body, which are commonly call'd the <HI>KING's EVIL:</HI> I thought I could not do better now, after repeated <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;es,</HI>
<PB REF="10">than publi&s;h a rational <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> of this kind, exemplify'd by many Experimental <HI>Cures;</HI> as well to ju&s;tify my own <HI>Preten&s;i|ons</HI> and <HI>Knowledge</HI> again&s;t common Preju|dice or vulgar Incredulity, as to &s;atisfy other People either about my Care, Method, or Abi|lity, and to convince 'em at la&s;t of the Truth of it by <HI>Matter of Fact.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> then is not u&s;her'd into the World with a <HI>Bravado,</HI> either to offend or affront other excellent <HI>Practicers</HI> in their way, tho' perhaps often <HI>Un&s;ucce&s;sful;</HI> but on|ly, with a mode&s;t Confidence, and without much boa&s;ting of an incomparable <HI>NOSTRUM,</HI> to aver, that for Eighteen Years already pa&s;t, I have cur'd great Numbers of <HI>Men, Wo|men,</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> who had been &s;orely afflicted a long time with this difficult <HI>Di&s;tem|per,</HI> and almo&s;t (if not altogether) de&s;pair'd of by many eminent <HI>Surgeons:</HI> as will evi|dently appear by the <HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> of A|bode of the &s;everal <HI>Patients</HI> hereafter mention'd in the Conclu&s;ion of this <HI>Book.</HI></P>
<PB REF="11">
<P>Now the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of the Thing being plain|ly made out here, I think there is no denying of <HI>Experience</HI> or <HI>Skill</HI> in the Affair of this <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> without winking (as it were) at the <HI>Sun,</HI> to di&s;pute its &s;hining. But how &s;hould &s;uch <HI>unlicens'd</HI> or <HI>illiterate Empericks,</HI> that know either little of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> or nothing at all of <HI>Chirugery,</HI> and yet pretend to cure &s;o unaccountable a <HI>Malady</HI> with <HI>Old Wives Medicines,</HI> or wor&s;e; how &s;hould they (I &s;ay) ever do any Good upon't? This is what I do not under&s;tand, and wonder at; why they &s;hould either he fondly employ'd by &s;ome credu|lous People, or &s;hould forwardly undertake &s;uch <HI>Impo&s;&s;ibilities</HI> them&s;elves; being both beyond their <HI>Reach</HI> as to <HI>manual Operation,</HI> and above the <HI>Sphere</HI> of their Knowledge as to <HI>Internal Medicines.</HI></P>
<P>The Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD indeed will go a great way in the&s;e de&s;perate <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> and without it, all is but <HI>Labour in vain</HI> at the be&s;t; let Man's <HI>Endeavours</HI> be never &s;o great, or their
<PB REF="12"><HI>Medicines</HI> never &s;o good: But then, who &s;hould find out better ordinary <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Cure,</HI> or take more proper <HI>Methods</HI> for't, than &s;ome old able experienc'd <HI>Profe&s;&s;or</HI> or other of the Art? As for my Self, far be it from Me to pre|tend to more than I can perform, and have often accompli&s;h'd with undeniable Succe&s;s. How|ever, <HI>Divines</HI> do not u&s;e to work <HI>Miracles</HI> now a-days; neither can they cure the <HI>KING's EVIL,</HI> I believe, by Virtue either of their <HI>Function, Sanctity,</HI> or <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> 'Tis cer|tainly either a <HI>Phy&s;ician's</HI> or a <HI>Surgeon's</HI> Bu|&s;ine&s;s, without making <HI>Ill Work</HI> on't. In &s;hort, &s;etting a&s;ide any other Formality of prefacing or vanity of Conceit as to my <HI>Preten&s;ion,</HI> I can only &s;ay this mode&s;tly; That the <HI>Hall</HI> hath long &s;ince authoriz'd my <HI>Practice</HI> by a <HI>DI|PLOMA,</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Licen&s;e</HI> I have from <HI>Doctors Commons;</HI> and I hope the <HI>Read|er</HI> as well as my <HI>Brother Surgeons,</HI> will now al&s;o approve on't, for the Benefit of Man|kind.</P>
<P>However, I hope, I may have leave to

<HEAD>CHAP. II <HI>The</HI> Nature <HI>of the</HI> EVIL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SEcondly;</HI> As to this <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Authors</HI> have de|fin'd it &s;everal ways: but the be&s;t <HI>Defi|nition</HI> that I can pretend to gather from 'em all, is <HI>This</HI> in brief. The <HI>Scrofula,</HI> is <HI>a praeternatural malignant Tumor or Hu|mour, produc'd by a particular Acidity of the Serum of the Blood:</HI> either in <HI>Gland, Mu&s;cle</HI> or <HI>Membrane,</HI> which it both <HI>co|agulates</HI> and <HI>indurates;</HI> or in the <HI>Marrow,</HI> which it always <HI>di&s;&s;olves,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>pu|trefies</HI> the <HI>Bone.</HI> But le&s;t this <HI>Definition</HI> &s;hould want any further <HI>Illustration,</HI> I &s;hall explain my &s;elf thus more at large, in a particular manner: Now 'tis plain, this Acidity in the <HI>Serum of the Blood,</HI> mu&s;t needs occa&s;ion a very <HI>Cra&s;s, Glu|tinous</HI> and <HI>Acid Lympha</HI> in the Body; which not finding any convenient or regular <HI>Pa&s;&s;age</HI> thro' its proper <HI>Channels,</HI> pre&s;ently &s;tops in the <HI>Glands</HI> or <HI>El&s;e|where,</HI> and &s;en&s;ibly <HI>tumefies</HI> or <HI>indurates</HI> the Parts affected: So that, in &s;hort,
<PB N="11" REF="27">by rea&s;on of this <HI>Corro&s;ive Quality,</HI> the Di&s;temper in time becomes Malignant, obdurate and very difficult to be <HI>cured;</HI> the <HI>Lympha</HI> being &s;o <HI>vi&s;cous</HI> and &s;o &s;trongly &s;ettled in &s;ome extreme <HI>Parts,</HI> that it often proves the harde&s;t thing in the World to <HI>thin, rarifie</HI> and <HI>attenuate,</HI> or take away &s;uch an <HI>Obstruction,</HI> of <HI>&s;our, stagnating, coagulated Juices.</HI> From hence it appears, that the <HI>Acid Matter</HI> whe|ther contain'd <HI>within</HI> a Cy&s;tis, or Swel|ling el&s;ewhere <HI>without,</HI> either in the <HI>Salivatory Glands,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>One</HI> Re&s;pect, or in thick <HI>&V;pper Lips</HI> chopt &amp;c. in the <HI>Other;</HI> is the only Thing to be recti|fy'd or &s;weeten'd, in Order to effect a <HI>perfect Cure:</HI> And I cannot conceive how <HI>that</HI> can be done <HI>radically,</HI> &s;ave only by <HI>Alcalious Medicines,</HI> which is the <HI>Nostrum</HI> pretended to in my <HI>Pra|ctice:</HI> For otherwi&s;e the latent, habi|tual and inveterate <HI>Corro&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of the &s;harp indurated <HI>Lympha,</HI> which is the principal <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil,</HI> will continually prove <HI>Incorrigible</HI> by all the <HI>Art of Man.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Struma</HI> being a <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> of that <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>&s;our Nature,</HI> it mu&s;t be corrected and dul|cify'd by &s;weet healing <HI>Medicines,</HI> as
<PB N="12" REF="28">the mo&s;t Powerful <HI>Means</HI> to bring the <HI>Acid Humours</HI> or <HI>Juices</HI> to their due <HI>Tone,</HI> as well as the <HI>Constitution</HI> to it's pri&s;tine or natural State of <HI>Health</HI> and Vigour.</P>
<P>But to give a more exact <HI>Account</HI> of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Thing already <HI>de|fin'd,</HI> I think my &s;elf oblig'd to explain the true Meaning of the <HI>Terms, Coagu|lation</HI> and <HI>Di&s;&s;olution,</HI> in this Place, as pat to the Purpo&s;e. Now by <HI>Coagula|tion,</HI> I mean an irregular <HI>Curd-ling</HI> or <HI>Thick'ning</HI> of the Blood by a real Priva|tion of <HI>Moisture;</HI> &s;o that I can com|pare it to nothing but that of making a <HI>Curd</HI> of Milk with <HI>Rennet.</HI> Now it is notorious that many <HI>&s;trumous Tumors,</HI> being full of a white <HI>curled Matter,</HI> have a <HI>Likene&s;s</HI> at lea&s;t, if not al&s;o an <HI>Affinity</HI> with the <HI>Curd</HI> of Milk; which are <HI>Both</HI> alike occa&s;ion'd by a <HI>coagulating Acidity,</HI> though perhaps of a <HI>different Nature:</HI> and yet they mu&s;t be <HI>Both</HI> very near as <HI>acrimonious</HI> as <HI>Aqua fortis</HI> or <HI>Spi|rit of Vitriol,</HI> to turn either the fibrous Parts of <HI>Blood</HI> or the gro&s;s Particles of <HI>Milk</HI> into a kind of <HI>Chee&s;e</HI> or <HI>curdled Matter</HI> by a coagulating <HI>Fermentation.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="29">To confirm this Notion, it will be &s;uf|ficient to appeal to many <HI>Patients,</HI> whe|ther they are not often &s;en&s;ible of the mo&s;t painful <HI>Corro&s;ions,</HI> next to the <HI>gnawing of Dogs;</HI> which mu&s;t needs pro|ceed from a &s;ort of a &s;harp <HI>vitriolick Acidity,</HI> that <HI>&s;tops, coagulates</HI> and <HI>cor|rodes</HI> the Part &s;o affected, or indeed ra|ther afflicted, with this Malady.</P>
<P>But on the <HI>other hand;</HI> the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> why I a&s;cribe <HI>Di&s;&s;olution</HI> to the &s;ame <HI>Acidity,</HI> is <HI>this:</HI> Becau&s;e whenever it comes to the <HI>Marrow,</HI> and mixes with the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Bone,</HI> it <HI>di&s;&s;olves</HI> and rots 'em in all Per&s;ons; for every Body knows that <HI>One</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame Cau&s;e</HI> may have different <HI>Effects,</HI> according to the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Subject Matter</HI> that is wrought upon; for it is a true <HI>Maxim,</HI> that <HI>Whatever is received, is receiv'd accord|ing to the Quality or Nature of the Receiver;</HI> As for In&s;tance, the <HI>Sun</HI> melts <HI>Butter</HI> and hardens <HI>Clay;</HI> and <HI>Vinegar</HI> coagulates <HI>Milk,</HI> but di&s;&s;olves an <HI>Egg,</HI> White and Shell and all. Thus in like manner does our <HI>&s;trumous Acidity</HI> operate divers ways; for when it falls upon the <HI>Serum of the Blood,</HI> then follows <HI>Coagulation</HI> in the
<PB N="14" REF="30"><HI>fibrous Parts</HI> of it, and &s;o it proceeds <HI>uncorrected</HI> to the furthe&s;t Members of the Body: But when it penetrates the <HI>Bone</HI> and gets into the <HI>Marrow,</HI> it has a quite contrary <HI>Effect;</HI> and is &s;o far from indurating or hardening them, that it <HI>di&s;&s;olves</HI> and <HI>putrefies</HI> the very <HI>Hardne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Con&s;istency</HI> that it meets with <HI>there.</HI></P>
<P>And thus, in &s;hort, having &s;et forth the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Struma,</HI> whether as a <HI>Tumor</HI> or <HI>&V;lcer;</HI> whether in the <HI>Glan|dules</HI> or <HI>el&s;ewhere,</HI> by as clear a Light as I could fetch, either from <HI>Authority</HI> or <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> I &s;hall now take upon me in Order of my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> to enquire into the various <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of it.</P>

<P><HI>THirdly;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e by this time no Man will deny, that the <HI>Praeter|natural Acidity</HI> of the <HI>Serum of the Blood,</HI> is the immediate <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil;</HI> as it renders the whole <HI>Lympha</HI> acrimonious and indurated, and thereby produces a <HI>Cra&s;s, Glutinous, Coagulated</HI> Matter in &s;everal Parts of the Body. But as to the <HI>Mediate</HI> or more <HI>Remote Cau&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Scrofula,</HI> there are a great <HI>many</HI> a&s;&s;ign'd by the <HI>Learned;</HI> to make it either <HI>Hereditary</HI> from the <HI>Parents,</HI> or <HI>Accidental</HI> from <HI>Air, Diet, Exerci&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Tis as manife&s;t, as the No&s;e upon a Man's Face, that the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Scro|phulous</HI> or <HI>Strumous Parents,</HI> are com|monly liable to the &s;ame <HI>Distemper;</HI> and &s;o are <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> that &s;uck the <HI>Milk</HI> of &s;uch di&s;eas'd <HI>Nur&s;es.</HI> Now this argues the <HI>Malady</HI> to be deeply imprinted upon the whole <HI>Ma&s;s of Blood,</HI> or naturally im|planted
<PB N="16" REF="32">in the very <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> of &s;ome Per&s;ons; &s;eeing that it may be, and often is &s;o traduc'd, and entail'd by <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> thus afflicted and never cur'd, up|on their <HI>Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot omit one <HI>Ob&s;erva|tion</HI> by the By; that <HI>Children</HI> al&s;o who are begotten at improper Times of the <HI>Moon,</HI> have been often &s;ubject to be af|flicted with <HI>This Evil,</HI> and to the la&s;t Degree too of <HI>Virulency.</HI> Let this be a <HI>Warning</HI> to <HI>Marry'd</HI> People.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides <HI>The&s;e,</HI> there are &s;ome <HI>Per|&s;ons</HI> who&s;e natural <HI>Temper of Blood</HI> be|ing very <HI>Acid,</HI> and the <HI>Serum</HI> by that means very apt to <HI>coagulate,</HI> are gene|rally Obnoxious to it; as <HI>Children</HI> troubled with the <HI>Rickets,</HI> and all <HI>O|thers</HI> that are <HI>Weakly,</HI> or in whom the <HI>Heat</HI> is not &s;trong enough for a regular <HI>Dige&s;tion.</HI></P>

<P>However yet I mu&s;t needs grant, that there are various <HI>Opinions</HI> among divers <HI>Authors</HI> about the <HI>True Cau&s;es</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil. Some</HI> think that it pro|ceeds from the <HI>Succus Nutritius,</HI> being di&s;order'd in tho&s;e that feed too much

Others</HI> again have fan|cy'd, that die <HI>Imagination</HI> being mightily di&s;turbed by <HI>Want, Sadne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Melancholy;</HI> it weakens and di&s;orders the <HI>Dige&s;tive Faculty</HI> in the Stomach; and &s;o con&s;e|quently at long run, produces tho&s;e knotty <HI>Tumors,</HI> we find in <HI>Scrofulous Patients:</HI> But this &s;eems to be <HI>Ridi|culous.</HI> There are <HI>Some</HI> yet that &s;ay, the <HI>Vi&s;cous Nature</HI> of the <HI>Succus Nervo|rum</HI> mu&s;t needs be the very <HI>Immediate Efficient Cau&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>&s;trumous Tumors</HI> in the <HI>Salivatory Glands;</HI> for that the <HI>thick Juice</HI> lying there long, grows har|der and harder by <HI>coagulating,</HI> and can|not pa&s;s at la&s;t, by rea&s;on of it's <HI>Indura|tion.</HI> However, we find <HI>Others</HI> again of a quite different <HI>Opinion;</HI> who a|&s;cribe the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of it to a <HI>coagulated Phlegm</HI> or a <HI>&s;our Blood</HI> in the very <HI>Part</HI> affected: where the <HI>thick Acid Juices</HI> are <HI>obstru|cted,</HI> grow <HI>stiff</HI> or <HI>obdurate,</HI> and <HI>mag|nifie</HI> to the la&s;t Extremity of <HI>Rancour</HI> or <HI>Foulne&s;s.</HI> But <HI>Some,</HI> on the <HI>other hand,</HI>

<P><HI>FOurthly;</HI> Now the <HI>Parts</HI> that are mo&s;t frequently afflicted with the <HI>Struma,</HI> I reckon to be the <HI>Glandules</HI> (that have &s;ometimes pa&s;s'd under the Comical Allu&s;ive Name of the <HI>Sow</HI> and <HI>Pigs</HI>) the <HI>Mu&s;cles, Membranes, Tendons</HI> and <HI>Bones.</HI> The <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> likewi&s;e often <HI>&s;uffer</HI> by't: but if the <HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Brain</HI> are ever touch'd or tainted with any <HI>&s;crofulous Humour,</HI> the <HI>Juices</HI> of tho&s;e Parts are di&s;&s;olv'd, not <HI>coagulated</HI> nor <HI>tu|mefy'd,</HI> as I &s;aid before of the <HI>Marrow</HI> and the <HI>Bones:</HI> For I have never yet ob|&s;erv'd any <HI>Tumors</HI> either in the <HI>Nerves</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="38">or the <HI>Brain,</HI> but only tho&s;e <HI>Parts</HI> wa+&s;ted and grown <HI>Carious</HI> by the <HI>Corro&s;ion</HI> of the vicious <HI>Humours,</HI> and more in|clin'd to <HI>Putrefaction</HI> than any obdurate Con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Part</HI> that is u&s;ually <HI>fir&s;t</HI> affected with this <HI>Malady,</HI> proves to be the <HI>Me&s;entery;</HI> for it has often been found by undeniale <HI>Experience</HI> that the <HI>Me&s;enterick Glands</HI> have been inwardly <HI>&s;trumous,</HI> both as to <HI>Obstruction</HI> and <HI>Tu|mour;</HI> when at the &s;ame time, there have appear'd no vi&s;ible <HI>Symptoms</HI> of any &s;uch <HI>Malignity</HI> Upon the <HI>outward Glands:</HI> Nor indeed has there been any &s;uch <HI>&s;crofulous</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Hu|mour</HI> at all there in Reality. And then again we may depend upon't, that when|ever the <HI>external Glands</HI> are ob&s;tructed and &s;well'd, the <HI>Me&s;entericks</HI> are cer|tainly afflicted in like manner: So that there's no doubt but the <HI>Me&s;entery</HI> is commonly the <HI>first Part</HI> affected and &s;poil'd by a <HI>corro&s;ive Acidity</HI> of this Kind.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Glands,</HI> after all is &s;aid, are the <HI>principal Seat</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Evil;</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="39">in&s;omuch, that &s;ome of the <HI>Antients</HI> re|&s;train'd the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>Parts</HI> only, as if no <HI>other</HI> had been <HI>&s;ubject</HI> to't: And yet we find many more <HI>Places</HI> notori|ou&s;ly <HI>affected</HI> with it to a violent degree. However, con&s;idering that there are &s;e|veral &s;orts of <HI>Glandules,</HI> whether <HI>Conglo|bate</HI> or <HI>Conglomerate</HI> (as &s;ome call 'em); I cannot but think, that tho&s;e we term <HI>Reductive,</HI> which &s;erve for the <HI>Percola|tion</HI> of the <HI>Lympha,</HI> mu&s;t needs be mo&s;t afflicted of all <HI>others:</HI> For why? when|ever the <HI>Serum</HI> or the <HI>Lympha</HI> is &s;o di&s;|order'd and grown <HI>Acid,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Glands</HI> that perform the Office of <HI>Aquae.ducts,</HI> or <HI>Conduits,</HI> will doubtle&s;s <HI>&s;uffer</HI> extreme|ly, either by <HI>Obstruction,</HI> or by <HI>Corro&s;ion,</HI> or <HI>both.</HI> Now when the <HI>Parts</HI> thro' which the <HI>Lympha</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s pure and regular, are &s;o <HI>tumefy'd</HI> and <HI>&s;topp'd up,</HI> we may depend upon it to be an <HI>infallible Symp|tom</HI> of the <HI>Kings' Evil.</HI></P>
<P>However yet, no <HI>Place</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> more frequently and vi&s;ibly abounds with <HI>&s;trumous Coagulations,</HI> than the <HI>Neck</HI> quite around; which being <HI>Bare,</HI> e&s;peci|ally in <HI>Women,</HI> is more expos'd to the Sharpne&s;s of the <HI>Cold Weather;</HI> and that
<PB N="24" REF="40">Quality of the <HI>Air,</HI> without doubt, huge|ly helps on the <HI>Acid Matter</HI> to &s;tagnate or lodge there, as well as it aggravates the <HI>Evil</HI> in this particular <HI>Part.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed; the <HI>Brea&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Arm|pits,</HI> the <HI>Lungs</HI> them&s;elves, the <HI>Salivals,</HI> and the <HI>Ton&s;ils</HI> are al&s;o &s;ometimes mi&s;e|rably troubl'd with <HI>Scrofulous Tumors;</HI> as will evidently appear to the Eye of any <HI>Common Practicer.</HI></P>
<P>Neither are the <HI>Glands</HI> in the <HI>Groyn</HI> always free from this <HI>Malady,</HI> nor the <HI>Te&s;ticles,</HI> nor the <HI>Pro&s;tatae,</HI> which are two <HI>Glandules</HI> under the <HI>Seminal Bladders;</HI> tho' it is a little <HI>difficult</HI> &s;ometimes to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e <HI>Tumors</HI> from the <HI>Effects</HI> of another ba&s;e &s;u&s;pected <HI>Di&s;temper.</HI></P>
<P>So much for the <HI>Natural Glands;</HI> but now there are be&s;ides <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Ad|ventitious Praeternatural</HI> ones, occa&s;ion'd by this <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> which ari&s;e vi&s;ibly in|fected with the &s;ame <HI>Rancour,</HI> in the <HI>Face, Arms, Legs, Skin, Mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>Mem|branes;</HI> no, and &s;ometimes &s;preading o|ver the whole <HI>Body,</HI> from <HI>Head</HI> to <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet, Fingers</HI> and <HI>Toes;</HI> not excepting the very <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> them&s;elves from being

<P>As to the <HI>Affection</HI> of the <HI>Bones,</HI> 'tis notoriou&s;ly well known, that &s;etting a|&s;ide the <HI>Glands, they</HI> are as <HI>much troubled</HI> (I might &s;ay, <HI>tormented</HI>) with this <HI>cor|roding Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> as any other <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Body;</HI> not to &s;ay <HI>more.</HI> But then the&s;e are very <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from all <HI>Glandulous Tumors;</HI> for tho' the <HI>Bone</HI> may &s;eem <HI>outwardly</HI> hard and &s;ound, yet the <HI>Juices</HI> are all putrefy'd and rotten <HI>within</HI> at the &s;ame time.

<PB N="27" REF="43">too: Upon which, a Neighbouring <HI>Sur|geon</HI> of Note being &s;ent for, he fir&s;t made u&s;e of <HI>Catapla&s;ms</HI> to break it, and then apply'd &s;everal Suppurating <HI>Empla&s;tres;</HI> but all to little or no <HI>Purpo&s;e,</HI> &s;ave only, that he entertain'd &s;ome <HI>Hopes</HI> &s;till of do|ing me good.

<P>After this, a &s;econd <HI>Surgeon</HI> was im|mediately imploy'd; who having dili|gently <HI>dre&s;s'd</HI> me about a Year, at la&s;t brake the <HI>Swelling,</HI> and al&s;o perfectly <HI>heal'd</HI> it to every Bodys thinking; but then it prov'd to be only a palliative <HI>Cure,</HI> for in le&s;s than a Month's time, another large <HI>Tumor</HI> fell into my <HI>Left Thigh;</HI> which yet co&s;t both <HI>him</HI> and <HI>my &s;elf</HI> a great deal of Trouble for above a Year, before ever we could perceive it any <HI>bet|ter.</HI> And when we did find it pretty well, as far as we could judge external|ly,

<PB N="29" REF="45">
<P>To be brief, I was under <HI>their Hands,</HI> and other Eminent <HI>Surgeons,</HI> for full E|leven Years or upwards; and one of them, indeed, had healed my <HI>Thigh</HI> in that time: But then my <HI>Foot</HI> continu'd as <HI>bad</HI> as ever, not to &s;ay <HI>wor&s;e.</HI> Where|upon, <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> of the <HI>Ho&s;pital-Surge|ons</HI> con&s;ulted about it; and de&s;pairing of any <HI>Cure,</HI> were ab&s;olutely unanimous for <HI>Amputation.</HI> I readily agreed to't, how unwillingly &s;oever; and the Day was fix'd.

<P>Now, by this time, my whole <HI>Body</HI> Was &s;o <HI>emaciated</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> that I could not &s;upport my &s;elf without my <HI>Crutches,</HI> and I had not &s;et my <HI>Left Foot</HI> to the Ground for near <HI>Seven Years.</HI> But, as <HI>Providence</HI> would have it, before the <HI>Day</HI> came that was fix'd for <HI>cutting off my Leg,</HI> we were well recommended to one Mr.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now having quite <HI>fini&s;hed</HI> what I at <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> propos'd about the <HI>King's Evil;</HI> as to the <HI>Name,</HI> the <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of it, as well as the <HI>Parts</HI> affected, the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> of a Per&s;on &s;o afflict|ed, and the <HI>Cure</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> by Ex|perience: I might here make &s;ome <HI>Apology</HI> according to <HI>Cu&s;tom, Fa&s;hion,</HI> or <HI>Formality,</HI> for the <HI>Meane&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Perfor|mance;</HI> but I am none of that modi&s;h <HI>Temper,</HI> or complai&s;ant <HI>Faculty</HI> in Wri|ting, as only to oblige the <HI>Airy People</HI> of the Age by a di&s;&s;embling Mode&s;ty.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>UPon <HI>&s;econd Thoughts,</HI> it may, per|haps, be expected by the <HI>Publick,</HI> that I &s;hould give &s;ome Account of my <HI>Medicines</HI> above-mention'd, both as to the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> of them: And therefore, as I would not <HI>omit</HI> any thing <HI>material</HI> that might <HI>oblige</HI> the World, &s;o I could not, for the better Satisfaction of People, forbear making the following <HI>Propo&s;als,</HI> by way of <HI>After-Thought.</HI></P>
<P>I. As for my <HI>Alcalious</HI> and <HI>Diuretick Me|dicines,</HI> which I give <HI>internally</HI> in all Ca&s;es of the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> with the greate&s;t <HI>Safety</HI> imaginable; they certainly correct every praeternatural <HI>Acidity</HI> in the <HI>first Dige&s;tion,</HI> which is the <HI>primary Cau&s;e</HI> of all other <HI>ill Effects</HI> in the Body. They give the <HI>Patient</HI> an extraordinary <HI>Ap|petite,</HI> comfort the <HI>Vitals,</HI> throw off the <HI>morbifick Humour</HI> from the <HI>Vi&s;cora</HI> or <HI>Bowels</HI> to the Extreme Parts of the <HI>Body;</HI> cheer the <HI>Spirits,</HI> &s;trengthen the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="70">and at la&s;t &s;weeten the whole <HI>Ma&s;s of Blood:</HI> Giving immediate <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> al&s;o to <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> under the mo&s;t violent, acute and corroding <HI>Pains,</HI> in what Part &s;o|ever afflicted, either with <HI>&s;crofulous Tu|mors</HI> or <HI>&V;lcers.</HI> Be&s;ides, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that &s;everal <HI>langui&s;hing People,</HI> who have had the U&s;e of their <HI>Limbs</HI> taken from them by tho&s;e <HI>Evils,</HI> for a con&s;i|derable time together, have yet been perfectly re&s;tor'd by the&s;e powerful Al|cali's, beyond Expectation. I need not mention <HI>many</HI> more al&s;o, who have been <HI>Convul&s;ive</HI> to the la&s;t degree of Danger and De&s;pair, that have been pre&s;erv'd in like manner, and effectually <HI>cur'd,</HI> both of their <HI>Fits</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> by the &s;ame <HI>Medicines;</HI> even when <HI>Opiates</HI> them&s;elves have prov'd <HI>ineffective,</HI> and where all other <HI>Means</HI> have fail'd of <HI>Succe&s;s.</HI> Only give me Leave to add over and above, that <HI>they</HI> are very plea&s;ant to the <HI>Tast;</HI> and the largest <HI>Quantity</HI> that I give to any one <HI>Patient</HI> at once, doth not exceed the Bigne&s;s of a <HI>common Pea.</HI> In &s;hort, they are wonderfully <HI>Gentle</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;ie</HI> in their <HI>O|peration,</HI> &s;o that they work only by <HI>Per|&s;piration</HI> and <HI>&V;rine,</HI> without any Stre&s;s

<P N="2">II. And as tho&s;e <HI>Cordial Alcali's</HI> which are both of a <HI>Diuretick</HI> and <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> Virtue, contribute very much towards bringing any <HI>malignant &s;trumous Tumors</HI> to a palpable <HI>Suppuration</HI> the &s;ooner, &s;o they happily prepare the <HI>Parts</HI> affected for the immediate Application of my <HI>Digestive Bal&s;am;</HI> which is &s;o Power|ful in its <HI>Dige&s;tion,</HI> that without either <HI>Cau&s;tick</HI> or <HI>Inci&s;ion,</HI> or any other painful <HI>Treatment,</HI> it does in a &s;hort time, gently lay open the mo&s;t inveterate <HI>Swelling</HI> of what kind &s;oever, in the <HI>Glands</HI> or <HI>el&s;e|where;</HI> it &s;ucks out the cold, curdl'd and coagulated <HI>Cores;</HI> exfoliates the foul <HI>Bones,</HI> de&s;troys the <HI>Callow Lips</HI> of the <HI>Sores, mundi&s;ies, incarns,</HI> and ab&s;olutely <HI>cicatrizes</HI> the <HI>Parts</HI> aggriev'd, by its <HI>bal|&s;amick</HI> and <HI>healing Virtue.</HI> But I will here pre&s;ume to &s;ay by the <HI>By,</HI> that I have wrought as great and remarkable <HI>Cures</HI> with it al&s;o upon <HI>Cancers;</HI> altho' treated by many <HI>others,</HI> whether <HI>Arti&s;ts</HI> or unskilful <HI>Pretenders,</HI> a long time without any commendable <HI>Succe&s;s:</HI> For by dre&s;&s;ing them a few times with this

<P N="3">III. In fine, as to my <HI>Di&s;cu&s;&s;ive Em|pla&s;tre,</HI> it is of &s;uch a Sovereign <HI>Virtue,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> that let a <HI>&s;crofulous Tumor</HI> be never &s;o Hard and Ob&s;tinate to re&s;i&s;t all <HI>&s;uppurative Medicines</HI> whatever, tho' it be of the large&s;t Size and Figure; yet this <HI>ef|ficatious Di&s;cutient,</HI> being apply'd only once a Week, opens the <HI>Pores</HI> &s;o power|fully, and di&s;charges the <HI>&s;harp Humour</HI> &s;o much by <HI>Sweat,</HI> that in &s;hort, at la&s;t, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my <HI>Alcalious</HI> and <HI>Diuretick Medicines,</HI> it perfectly <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>annihilates</HI> the whole vitious <HI>Coagu|lation.</HI> The <HI>Nature</HI> of this <HI>Emplastre</HI> is as <HI>&s;trength'ning</HI> al&s;o, as it is undeniably <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ive;</HI> and it does not only <HI>di&s;per&s;e</HI> the <HI>acrimonious Humour,</HI> but as well al|&s;o <HI>fortifies</HI> the <HI>Part</HI> that was affected with the mo&s;t obdurate <HI>Tumor;</HI> again&s;t any future <HI>Relap&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the <HI>Publick,</HI> I propo&s;e, that any <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> who live in the <HI>Remote Parts</HI> of the Kingdom, may be &s;upply'd with all the&s;e <HI>Medicines,</HI> both <HI>Internal</HI> and <HI>External,</HI> and with particular <HI>Directions</HI> al&s;o how to make
