<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, and the more adapted to the occa&s;ions of life, the matters are which an author takes upon him to lay before his readers, the more he an&s;wers that end, which every virtuous man ought, in ju|&s;tice, to propo&s;e to him&s;elf in every addre&s;s to the Public, and the more &s;uch matters claim the atten|tion and patience of the reader. The&s;e con&s;iderations have princi|pally
<PB N="ii" REF="4">weighed with me in favour of the pre&s;ent undertaking, and I pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf, on this occa&s;ion, the approbation of every one, who can put a due value on the enjoyment of his &s;en&s;es, as well as of him, who can be &s;en&s;ible of the great di&s;ad|vantage ari&s;ing from the lo&s;s of any of them.</P>
<P>Sight and hearing are undoubt|edly two of the principal external &s;en&s;es, as they &s;upply us with the knowledge of a far greater number of external objects, than the other &s;en&s;es put together; which, though indeed of con&s;iderable, are yet of a more limited u&s;efulne&s;s, and their impairment or lo&s;s more tolerable; but blind or deaf, what melancholy objects! Both blind and deaf, what accumulated woe!</P>
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
<P>I wave, at pre&s;ent, the &s;everal attempts wich have been made, in order to correct the manifold defects of &s;ight, at lea&s;t to le&s;&s;en or render them tolerable, confining my re|flections, on this occa&s;ion, to that of hearing; and, for that purpo&s;e I &s;hall relate the &s;everal means de|vi&s;ed, in order to amend this &s;en&s;e, when impaired, or retrieve it, when intirely lo&s;t; or by help of the other &s;en&s;es, and a tolerable degree of under&s;tanding in the patient, to render its lo&s;s, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, more tolerable: And la&s;tly, I &s;hall &s;elect, among the &s;everal methods propo&s;ed, that, which to me ap|pears, to be the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple.

<PB N="iv" REF="6">and from the &s;tructure of the outer and inner ear; and then more ac|curately determine the greater or le&s;s utility of the methods hitherto employed, in order to amend the&s;e defects.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Containing reflections preparatory to the following di&s;cour&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the defects, to which the &s;en&s;e of hearing is &s;ubject, the greate&s;t, without di&s;pute, is the entire lo&s;s thereof, or that, which, in a word, we call <HI>deafne&s;s.</HI> This, when ei|ther brought into the world, or contracted before a child comes to the u&s;e of his un|der&s;tanding, and before he learns to &s;peak, renders him very unhappy, as thereby he continues to be &s;peechle&s;s or dumb, and
<PB N="2" REF="8">thus precluded all &s;ocial intercour&s;e. And this is the rea&s;on, why per&s;ons born deaf, are at the &s;ame time al&s;o dumb, if not taught to &s;peak by &s;ome peculiar devices, or by means of the other &s;en&s;es. To this defect of hearing, we are to cla&s;s that which is called <HI>difficulty of hearing;</HI> which, be&s;ides that it comes neare&s;t to ab&s;olute deafne&s;s, proceeds, for the mo&s;t part, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, only in a le&s;s de|gree; all the other defects of this &s;en&s;e, as not being to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, we &s;hall wave at this time.</P>
<P>All the &s;en&s;es have from nature their proper organs, which are in a certain de|terminate manner affected and altered by external objects; and fir&s;t, in that they propagate the&s;e affections or alterations to the <HI>common &s;en&s;ory,</HI> and thereby render our &s;en&s;ations complete, and communicate them to the &s;oul. Now, as deafne&s;s is the inability to perceive tho&s;e tremulous or vibratory motions of the air, which produce &s;ound; the cau&s;e of this defect mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, either in the organ it|&s;elf, namely the ear, or in its connection with the common &s;en&s;ory, the vibrations
<PB N="3" REF="9">of the air being prevented from producing the nece&s;&s;ary and determinate alterations in tho&s;e parts of the human body. The &s;ame thing holds with re&s;pect to difficulty of hearing, as being only a le&s;s degreee of deafne&s;s.</P>
<P>The ear con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal di&s;tinct parts, which together concur to produce the &s;en&s;e of hearing. Hence, if the cau&s;es of deafne&s;s, or of a difficulty of hearing, are in the ear it&s;elf, one or more parts thereof mu&s;t be injured, that is, be in a preterna|tural &s;tate. To &s;hew this the more di|&s;tinctly, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider tho&s;e parts &s;eparately, and to explain the preter|natural alterations which occa&s;ion deafne&s;s, or a difficulty of hearing.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts commonly divide the parts of the ear into two &s;orts, namely, tho&s;e which belong to the external ear, and are &s;ituate without the temporal bones; and into tho&s;e that con&s;titute the inner ear, compri&s;ing all the parts that lie within the &s;aid bones.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t &s;ort belongs that which is properly called the outer ear, and the <HI>mea|tus auditorius,</HI> or auditory pa&s;&s;age or canal,
<PB N="4" REF="10">the inner part of which la&s;t, anatomi&s;ts generally refer to the inner ear; but it may be here very commodiou&s;ly treated, together with the external parts, as being only a pa&s;&s;age from them. As the diffe|rent defects of that which is properly called the external ear, if, in other re&s;pects, the aperture of the auditory pa&s;&s;age is not at the &s;ame time affected, may produce a diffi|culty of hearing, or other defect of this &s;en&s;e, but are never the cau&s;es of perfect deafne&s;s; &s;o I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on this, but directly handle the &s;everal defects of the auditory pa&s;&s;age, as an exter|nal part of the ear, &s;o far as they are to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the auditory pa&s;&s;age is, to propagate the vibrations of the air, com|municated externally thereto, by repeated repercu&s;&s;ions in its cavity, to the inner parts of the ear: And thence it is nece&s;|&s;ary, that this pa&s;&s;age be neither ob&s;truct|ed, nor extraordinarily con&s;tricted or &s;traitened. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, deafne&s;s is the con&s;equence; in the la&s;t, a difficulty of hearing at lea&s;t. The fir&s;t defect often ari&s;es either from a long accumulated, a
<PB N="5" REF="11">conden&s;ed, or a greatly indurated ear-wax, or from foreign bodies introduced into the auditory pa&s;&s;age; as for in&s;tance, cherry-&s;tones, peas, lead-&s;hot, &amp;c. or from tumours and impo&s;thumes, or from fle&s;hy or &s;pungy excre&s;cences therein; or, very often from the concretion of its &s;ides from &s;uch impo&s;thumes; or, la&s;tly, from a pellicle or membrance growing acro&s;s it, as is frequently ob&s;erved in new-born children. The other defect of the audi|tory pa&s;&s;age, namely, its too great con|&s;triction, may ari&s;e from the very &s;ame cau&s;es, if we only except the preternatural membrane &s;tretched acro&s;s it, or the ob|&s;truction of the auditory pa&s;&s;age by fluid matters, which diffu&s;e them&s;elves on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies of the parts of the ear, mentioned above, con&s;titutes the in|ner ear, and compri&s;es the membrane of the <HI>tympanum,</HI> or drum, its cavity, the la|byrinth, the <HI>tuba Eu&s;tachii,</HI> and the audi|tory nerves. The membrane of the drum receives by the auditory pa&s;&s;age the tremulous motions or vibrations of the air, which it farther diffu&s;es in its cavity, and
<PB N="6" REF="12">in the labyrinth. But particularly in the drum we find four &s;pecies of defects, which prevent its ordinary u&s;e: One, the too great flaccidity of its membrane, whereby it is unfitted for vibrations or tremulous motions, and &s;o tran&s;mits &s;ounds, either not at all, or but faintly, to the other inner parts. And hence we may judge, how it happens, that a phlegmatic con&s;titution, moi&s;t and purulent ears, damp air, foggy and rainy weather, and the like, often increa&s;e a difficulty of hearing, to a pitch of perfect deafne&s;s. The other defect of the membrane of the drum is directly oppo&s;ite to this, and con&s;i&s;ts in an extra|ordinary ten&s;ion thereof; which, when to &s;o con&s;iderable a degree, as too much to re|&s;i&s;t the in&s;inuating tremulous air, and pre|vent its vibrations, gives ri&s;e in like man|ner to a difficulty of hearing, and even to perfect deafne&s;s; as may be often ob|&s;erved in the ca&s;e of elderly people, and emaciated con&s;titutions. Both the&s;e de|fects, flaccidity and ten&s;ion, may al&s;o ari&s;e from an undue action of the mu&s;cles, moving the &s;mall auditory bones. But as &s;uch con&s;iderations would carry us to ana|tomical
<PB N="7" REF="13">and philo&s;ophical niceties, we &s;hall wave them at pre&s;ent, as not greatly to our purpo&s;e. The complete induration, or even o&s;&s;ification of the membrane of the drum, is the third defect; which may be&s;ides, from the &s;ame cau&s;es mentioned before, under the extraordinary ten&s;ion of this membrane, impair the hearing. And la&s;tly, its laceration con&s;titutes the fourth defect, which, indeed, does not &s;o &s;oon vitiate the hearing; as the air, in&s;inuating into the auditory pa&s;&s;age, can freely pa&s;s into the inner parts of the ear, and put them in motion: but then, by this im|mediate contact, the ju&s;t mentioned tender and &s;en&s;ible inner parts are blunted and rendered unfit for farther regular &s;en|&s;ations.</P>
<P>The cavity of the drum, and the laby|rinth are, indeed, as con&s;i&s;ting of bones of a more durable &s;ub&s;tance than all the parts of the ear hitherto mentioned, &s;ometimes, however, &s;ubject to &s;everal untoward acci|dents, whereby the hearing may be inju|red or depraved. For as they are covered with a very tender and extremely &s;en&s;ible <HI>perio&s;teum,</HI> which may be affected with
<PB N="8" REF="14">inflammation and impo&s;thume, and thereby be either de&s;troyed, or &s;o indurated, that no communicated vibrations of the air can any longer put them in due motion: Or, al&s;o, as the&s;e cavities are &s;ometimes &s;o choaked up with purulent matter, as to become unfit for propagating the vibratory motions of the air; or that at length there &s;ometimes en&s;ues from the impo&s;thuma|tion of the <HI>perio&s;teum,</HI> a caries of the bones them&s;elves, which may intirely de&s;troy the whole of this curious piece of mecha|ni&s;m, and unfit it for its de&s;tination.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, before I touch on the defects of the auditory nerve, I mu&s;t far|ther mention the <HI>tuba Eu&s;tachii,</HI> which &s;ome reckon among the parts of the exter|nal ear, but which I refer to the internal, becau&s;e the bony part of this pa&s;&s;age lies between the temporal bone and the <HI>os multiforme;</HI> be&s;ides, the entire pa&s;&s;age lies concealed in the cavity of the mouth: And running from the cavity of the drum to the palate, and terminating behind the ton&s;ils, with an aperture in the mouth, is partly bony, partly cartilaginous, and partly membranous, and internally lined
<PB N="9" REF="15">with a fine membrane full of muco&s;e glands: This pa&s;&s;age, I &s;ay, &s;erves princi|pally to renew or &s;hift the air, which is lodged in the inner cavities of the ear, in order to prevent its intire lo&s;s of ela&s;ticity by a too long confinement there. When this pa&s;&s;age therefore is either ob&s;tructed, or intirely de&s;troyed, the air, contained in the ear, will be unfit for the reception and propagation of that determinate degree of vibratory motion, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the act of hearing. The ob&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age often ari&s;es from a critical and catarrhous accumulation of mucus, from an incra&s;&s;ation and induration of this ac|cumulated mucus; from the &s;welling of the muco&s;e glands; from membranous and fibrous excre&s;cences; which, upon the ero&s;ion of the inner membrane of this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ometimes happen, particu|larly by a venereal taint; and from num|berle&s;s other cau&s;es. The ero&s;ion in this ca&s;e happens in the &s;ame manner, as was mentioned in the ero&s;ion of the membranes of the bones of the ear.</P>
<P>The auditory nerve is the la&s;t, but yet a principal part of the internal ear, and
<PB N="10" REF="16">the alone <HI>copula,</HI> or tie, by which this pe|culiar organ of &s;en&s;ation is connected with the common &s;en&s;ory. Whence al&s;o its due and regular di&s;po&s;ition is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary, in order to communicate to the &s;oul, by means of this &s;en&s;e, its pro|per perceptions and &s;en&s;ations. This com|munication or intercour&s;e of motion is in|terrupted, when the &s;ubtle fluid, called the nervous juice by phy&s;iological writers, is ob&s;tructed in its regular motion and pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e nerves and their principal branches. Mo&s;t pathologi&s;ts reckon principally, among the cau&s;es of this interrupted pa&s;&s;age, the ob&s;truction of the nerve. But as from phy&s;iological principles, it does not appear, how this extraordinary &s;ubtle fluid &s;hould be incra&s;|&s;ated, or the fibres of the nerves drawn together or contracted; the ob&s;truction in this ca&s;e mu&s;t be the &s;ame as when in the nutricious ve&s;&s;els, and within the <HI>involucra</HI> or &s;heaths of this nerve, accumulated, in|durated, or even extrava&s;ated juices from lacerated ve&s;&s;els, being collected, compre&s;s the nervous fibres. The principal defect, which in the&s;e nerves can po&s;&s;ibly inter|rupt
<PB N="11" REF="17">the motion of the nervous juice, is, &s;econdly, their compre&s;&s;ion; which may ari&s;e either at their origin, or near the common &s;en&s;ory, or in their entire length, either internally or externally, by accumu|lated or even extrava&s;ated blood, or other juices of the adjacent parts; as al&s;o in the ear it&s;elf, from a <HI>caries</HI> or <HI>exo&s;to&s;is</HI> of its bones; which la&s;t has often been ob&s;erved, particularly in venereal ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e defects of the auditory nerve hitherto mentioned, we are princi|pally to attend to the &s;eat of this di&s;or|der, and to its greater or le&s;s di&s;tance from the common &s;en&s;ory. For, when deaf|ne&s;s ari&s;es from compre&s;&s;ion, or even ero|&s;ion of the nerve &s;pread over the labyrinth, there &s;till remains a re&s;ource to &s;upply this defect in another and that an ingenious manner; and even to produce &s;uch &s;en&s;a|tions, as are otherwi&s;e communicated to the &s;oul by the organ of hearing. But if the origin of the nerve, namely, that part thereof which lies neare&s;t the com|mon &s;en&s;ory in the brain, is injured, it is not in the power of art to re&s;tore the &s;en&s;e of hearing. Yet by all this I would not
<PB N="12" REF="18">on any account deny, but that dumb per|&s;ons of this cla&s;s, might by the eye, by a long, careful, and attentive ob&s;ervation of the different motions of the mouth in the act of &s;peaking, be brought, at la&s;t, to under&s;tand the thoughts of tho&s;e about them; as in <HI>Amman</HI>'s method, of which hereafter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> An account of the attempts formerly made for the relief of the deaf.</HEAD>
<P>HOW various &s;oever the cau&s;es of deafne&s;s and difficulty of hearing, hitherto mentioned, may be, many have, for a long time pa&s;t, e&s;pecially more lat|terly, been employed in the que&s;t and di&s;covery of the means of removing &s;ome way or other, or at lea&s;t of dimini&s;hing this calamity. The many e&s;&s;ays for this purpo&s;e, made by phy&s;icians and inquirers into nature, may be very properly divi|ded into two cla&s;&s;es. To the fir&s;t I refer that method, according to which, a per|&s;on, either naturally deaf, or become &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="19">by &s;ome accident, may, by means of the other &s;en&s;es, without the intervention of the organs of hearing, or any part of them, be enabled to have tho&s;e perceptions, which others obtain by the &s;en&s;e of hear|ing. The &s;econd cla&s;s, on the contrary, compri&s;es tho&s;e methods, in which the auditory nerve it&s;elf is put in motion, and thus the very &s;en&s;ation produced in the &s;oul, which we u&s;ually call hearing. This method again is twofold: One, in which the vibratory motion of &s;ound is propaga|ted to the auditory nerve, by means of the ordinary, but, in other re&s;pects, faulty parts of the organ of hearing; by the in|tervention of &s;ome other bodies, and by a variety of ingenious devices. The other method, on the contrary, conveys &s;ound in like manner to the auditory nerve, and thus produces the &s;en&s;ation of hearing, not only by means of the ordinary channels and organs, but al&s;o by means of the ad|joining firm parts of the head.</P>
<P>Several phy&s;icians and other learned per&s;ons have been at great pains on the di&s;covery and improvement of the fir&s;t method, in order, by the other &s;en&s;es,
<PB N="14" REF="20">particularly the &s;ight, without the inter|vention of the auditory organs, to produce in the &s;oul the perceptions peculiar to the ear. But mo&s;t of the&s;e attempts have on|ly occa&s;ionally and incidentally proved of any benefit to the hearing: As mo&s;t of them have, in all their attempts, made it their principal view, to enable the deaf per&s;on to &s;peak; though, indeed, the fre|quent and attentive ob&s;ervation of the mo|tions of the mouth and other parts, which concur to form articulate &s;ounds, may give &s;uch a degree of readine&s;s to tho&s;e wretched per&s;ons, as to enable them to under&s;tand and di&s;tingui&s;h, with extraor|dinary quickne&s;s, all the motions of a &s;peaker, and thus al&s;o clearly to compre|hend all that is &s;poken. Nature her&s;elf has formed mo&s;t per&s;ons uncommonly do|cile in this re&s;pect, though otherwi&s;e not endued with the brighte&s;t parts. Expe|rience very day almo&s;t &s;hews, that deaf per&s;ons may ob&s;erve by the mouth, that which others &s;peak; and their uncommon and great attention is the rea&s;on, that they have the misfortune to be generally taken by the common people for very arch and rogui&s;h.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="21">
<P>But this very natural device, namely by means of the nice&s;t ob&s;ervation of the mo|tions of the mouth in the act of &s;peaking, employed in order to hear, and by imitat|ing the very &s;ame motions al&s;o to &s;peak, may be reduced to &s;everal rules, limited and de|termined by the genius of every language &s;poken, and thereby the learning them made much ea&s;ier. This is that device, in which, for a century and a half back, many learned men have employed their thoughts; among whom <HI>Peter Pontius, Paul Bonnetus,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wallis, Holder, Sib|&s;cota, Franci&s;cus Mercurius Van Hel|mont,</HI> but above all others, <HI>John Conrad Amman,</HI> have mo&s;t of all di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves. It would carry me too far, and be incon&s;i&s;tent with my pre&s;ent de|&s;ign, were I to recite here all the attempts made by the&s;e learned men to this pur|po&s;e, and their &s;ucce&s;s therein. Suffice it therefore to give a &s;hort account of the late&s;t attempt in that way, namely, that of Dr. <HI>Amman;</HI> and at the &s;ame time to point out its principal defect; but as to the others, briefly only to mention their writings, or other accounts we have of
<PB N="16" REF="22">them. <HI>Peter Pontius,</HI> a Spani&s;h Bene|dictine, who lived towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth century, made the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in this way, and taught deaf per&s;ons both to write and to &s;peak. His method, which he did not him&s;elf de&s;cribe, was afterwards improved by <HI>Paul Bonnetus,</HI> a ma&s;ter-gunner of the king of Arragon, and explained in a particular writing, en|titled, <HI>Reduccion de las letras, y arte para en&s;enar hablar los mudos;</HI> i. e. The re|&s;olution of the letters, with the art of ena|bling dumb per&s;ons to &s;peak, Madrid, 1620, in 4to. Dr. John Wallis, who af|ter both the former applied him&s;elf to improve this art, gave a de&s;cription there|of, both in his <HI>Tractatus grammatico-phy|&s;icus de loquela,</HI> and in his letter to the honourable Mr. Boyle, <HI>de &s;urdis muti&s;&abque; informandis.</HI> The former tract is al&s;o pre|fixed to his <HI>Grammatica linguae Angli|canae,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1653, and was after|wards often publi&s;hed with Dr. <HI>Amman</HI>'s writing.

<P>But above all others, <HI>John Conrad Amman,</HI> a phy&s;ician of Am&s;terdam, di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf more, towards the end of the la&s;t century, by his ingenious method of teaching the deaf and dumb to &s;peak: And after having happily &s;ucceeded in his method, not only on a deaf and dumb girl at Harlem, but al&s;o on his own daughter, and on &s;everal others, he publi&s;hed, in 1692, at Am&s;terdam, his Tract of <HI>Surdus loquens,</HI> in 8vo, wherein he laid open the whole of his method. Which being afterwards publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h by Daniel Foot, and highly ap|proved by the learned, he gave a new and more enlarged edition of it at Am&s;ter|dam in 1700, in 8vo, under this title, <HI>Di&s;&s;ertatio de loquela, qua non &s;olum vox humana et loquendi artificium, ex originibus &s;uis eruuntur, &s;ed et traduntur media, quibus ii, qui ab incunabulis, &s;urdi et muti fuerunt, loquelam adipi&s;ci, qui&abque; difficulter loquuntur, vitia &s;ua emendare po&s;&s;int.</HI> And afterwards there came out &s;everal editions thereof, a proof of the good reception it met with
<PB N="19" REF="27">from the public. On this foundation <HI>William Kerger</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed his method in his epi&s;tle <HI>De &s;urdo-mutorum cura,</HI> publi&s;hed in the appendix to the <HI>Ephe|merid. Acad. nat. curio&s;or. Cent.</HI> I. &amp; II. <HI>p.</HI> 233. <HI>&s;eqq.</HI> accommodating his in&s;truc|tions to the German language, together with a &s;uccinct account of his predece&s;&s;ors in the &s;ame method of treatment.</P>
<P>The whole of this method re&s;ts on that well known phy&s;iological principle, in|conte&s;tably confirmed by daily experience, namely, that we communicate our thoughts to each other by means of articulate &s;ounds, formed by the organs of &s;peech, which we call language: And, by a daily prac|tice, we in&s;en&s;ibly learn to form with every conception, a certain articulate found. The &s;imple articulate &s;ounds are generally four and twenty, and in &s;everal languages fewer, called letters of the al|phabet; which, when combined according to certain rules, and pronounced at once like a &s;ingle articulate &s;ound, are called &s;yllables, and a farther combination forms that which we call words. But all the&s;e articulate &s;ounds, in order to their pro|duction, require, at the &s;ame time, a cer|tain
<PB N="20" REF="28">vi&s;ible alteration and motion in the organs of &s;peech, namely, the lips, teeth, tongue, cheeks, larynx, &amp;c. For in|&s;tance, all &s;ounds, articulated by a bare aperture of the mouth in different degrees, are called vowels: And all others, form|ed by means of the other parts, are mutes or con&s;onants. And, indeed, the accurate attention to, and careful imita|tion of, all the particular motions requi|&s;ite to the articulation of &s;ounds, con&s;ti|tute the whole of <HI>Amman</HI>'s method.</P>
<P>As in this, or in any other method of the &s;ame kind, the organs of hearing contribute nothing to the effect, it may indeed, be employed in all the defects and imperfections of the auditory organs, by which either deafne&s;s or a difficulty of hearing is produced. This method, however, is &s;ubject to &s;everal con&s;idera|ble imperfections, which render it greatly inferior to &s;ome of the following methods, by which the auditory nerve it&s;elf is at the &s;ame time made to be affected. In the fir&s;t place, let us &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, and which actually happens, as appears from the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es, namely, that &s;uch a per&s;om is born deaf, dumb, and blind.
<PB N="21" REF="29">No one, certainly, though more dexterous than <HI>Amman</HI> him&s;elf, could, by that me|thod, impart the conceptions, which, in other re&s;pects, ari&s;e from the &s;en&s;e of hearing. But then it may be alledged, that if he cannot &s;ee, he may feel, at lea&s;t. I grant, that he may learn to &s;peak in that manner: But then, for one in this condi|tion, to lay his hands on the mouth and throat of the &s;peaker, would appeal clum|&s;y and aukward: Not to mention, that in forming &s;ounds, &s;everal motions are performed with the tongue, the teeth, the cheeks, the gums, &amp;c. mo&s;tly ob&s;ervable by the eye, but not properly to be felt, without interrupting the &s;peaker at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The &s;econd imperfection in this method, con&s;i&s;ts principally in confining the con|ceptions imparted, barely to language. All tho&s;e ravi&s;hing &s;en&s;ations, which, in other re&s;pects, the &s;en&s;e of hearing is &s;u&s;|ceptible of, are here quite lo&s;t; nor can the thrilling motions of the organs of &s;peech, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly lo&s;t in each other, when rai&s;ed with that rapidity in the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the deeper Pa&s;&s;ions, as to
<PB N="22" REF="30">&s;trike and &s;urprize the hearers, be once di&s;tingui&s;hed by, much le&s;s yield, that melting &s;en&s;ation to a per&s;on &s;o wretched. Much le&s;s could a &s;kilful mu&s;ician throw him into tho&s;e &s;oft and calm raptures, when under his hands, the &s;trings, in har|mony truly divine, thrill the hearer with un&s;peakable delight. Thirdly and la&s;tly, take a per&s;on of little or no natural abilities, and attempt to teach him in this manner; I am fully per&s;uaded, that all the pains taken with him, would be quite lo&s;t: Not <HI>Amman</HI> him&s;elf, with all his art and practical &s;kill, could hope to &s;ucceed in a ca&s;e of &s;uch indocility.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the &s;econd order of the attempts made to re&s;tore hearing to the deaf, by putting the auditory nerve it&s;elf in motion, thereby producing the &s;en&s;ation of hearing. I have already &s;hewn above, that this order may be pro|perly divided into two &s;orts. To the fir&s;t belong the methods of propagating &s;ound in a due degree of motion, by the ordinary though faulty organs of hearing, quite to the auditory nerve. To this we may ju&s;tly refer all tho&s;e contrivances, which, either
<PB N="23" REF="31">by peculiar in&s;truments, or other means or devices, rai&s;e or heighten the moti|ons and repercu&s;ions of the air in the chan|nels and cavities of the ear; when tho&s;e parts are &s;o faulty as not to be put into the proper vibratory motions by the ordinary action of &s;ound. And in this ca&s;e it is al|ways requi&s;ite, that the auditory channel be open.</P>
<P>When the auditory channel is thus open, or the other parts of the inner ear connec|ted therewith are &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome, though a very faint degree of, vibratory motion, and only require a greater ac|tion of the in&s;inuating air than is nece&s;&s;ary in a natural &s;tate, there hence ari&s;es a dif|ficulty of hearing, and not a perfect de|gree of deafne&s;s. Now as among the &s;e|veral methods of propagating &s;ound, by means of the parts mentioned, to the au|ditory nerve, in natural order, they are only of &s;ervice in difficulty of hearing, but not in the ca&s;e of perfect deafne&s;s; I &s;hall therefore mention only, in brief, &s;ome of the means of this &s;pecies of method. And one of the be&s;t known, and which nature her&s;elf, for the mo&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="32">part, points out, is, to apply the hand bent and hollow to the ear, and there|by not only to convey a greater quan|tity of vibrating air to the auditory chan|nel, but likewi&s;e to rai&s;e or heighten its repercu&s;&s;ions. With this view al|&s;o, &s;uch per&s;ons generally &s;et the mouth wide open, when they want to hear more accurately; that the air, reflected from the palate, may be forced through the <HI>tuba Eu&s;tachii</HI> into the cavity of the drum, and thereby render more inten&s;e the vi|bration of the air. But then we are to &s;uppo&s;e this la&s;t mentioned channel to have no ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>And this very heightening the action of &s;ound, is procured by means of peculiar in&s;truments. Of this &s;ort are acou&s;tic trumpets or horns, in&s;truments commonly well known, and which require no parti|cular notice to be taken of them here. Somewhat le&s;s known is the ingenious acou&s;tic drum of Father <HI>Seba&s;tian Truchel,</HI> a Carmelite monk, which, in 1718, he pre&s;ented to the royal academy of &s;ciences at Paris, and which had their approbation. This drum con&s;i&s;ts of gold-beater's &s;kin,
<PB N="25" REF="33">which is originally ox gut. This &s;kin is &s;tretched either on a round or an oval hoop, as is commonly done in drums; &s;o that when fa&s;tened to the ear, it forms, with the natural membrane of the drum of the ear, a perfect drum; the artificial &s;kin exhibiting the part which is &s;truck upon; the ear it&s;elf again and the auditory chan|nel, the kettle or hollow cavity of the drum; and the natural membrane of the drum of the ear, the undermo&s;t &s;kin of the drum. The artificial &s;kin had, be|fides, over it, a rai&s;ed cover, in &s;hape of a box, who&s;e aperture was turned to the mouth of the &s;peaker. A per&s;on hard of hearing in both ears, may, by means of a &s;emicircle of bra&s;s or &s;ilver, which goes round the hinder part of the head, under the hair or peruke, fa&s;ten two &s;uch drums to his ears.</P>
<P>We are now at length come to the other method of the &s;econd cla&s;s or order, compri&s;ing tho&s;e means which convey found, and thereby re&s;tore actual hearing by extraordinary ways, and not by means of the natural auditory channel, to the auditory nerve. But before I explain the
<PB N="26" REF="34">peculiar methods under this head, I mu&s;t here borrow three prepo&s;itions as princi|ples, from natural philo&s;ophy and ana|tomy, as they properly afford a natural foundation and rea&s;on for all the methods that are now to follow, and to all the remarks that may occa&s;ionally offer, as we proceed. In the fir&s;t place, &s;ound is propagated by bodies ela&s;tic, and &s;u&s;cepti|ble of a vibratory motion. Secondly, pro|pagation of &s;ound is interrupted by &s;ofter interpo&s;ing parts, un&s;u&s;ceptible of any, or of but faint vibrations. Thirdly, the bones of the &s;kull, in which the auditory nerves are lodged, form, with the upper maxil|lary bone, one continued hard and ela&s;tic body, uninterrupted in their connection by any &s;ofter parts, and hence extremely well adapted for the propagation of found.</P>
<P>As I have adduced the&s;e prepo&s;itions principally with the view that the at|tentive reader may have them con&s;tantly in his eye, either in pa&s;&s;ing a judgment on, or in explaining, the &s;everal methods, which, indeed, produce the &s;en&s;e of hear|ing by means of the auditory nerve, but
<PB N="27" REF="35">not by the natural auditory channel, to which cla&s;s al&s;o my own method, which I am now about to explain, does belong; &s;o I &s;hall at pre&s;ent, fir&s;t, hi&s;torically relate the &s;everal imperfect attempts of this kind: And then, &s;econdly, de&s;cribe my own method, in all its circum&s;tances, and in the whole of the manner of procedure. Thirdly and la&s;tly, explain it in its phy|&s;ical and phy&s;iological principles, and at the &s;ame time determine the particular ca&s;e, in which it is ab&s;olutely inapplica|ble.</P>
<P>We have extant experiments of a long &s;tanding, the fir&s;t careful attention to which is generally, at lea&s;t by Father <HI>Kir|cher,</HI> in his <HI>Mu&s;urgia univer&s;alis,</HI> P. II. p. 559. a&s;cribed to the celebrated Neapo|litan <HI>John Bapti&s;ta Porta;</HI> namely, that we can, for in&s;tance, hear the &s;ound of a ringing fork, when &s;triking its fore-part, or prongs, on another hard body, we hold its handle to the teeth. The very &s;ame thing is ob&s;ervable in a pair of tongs, a &s;teel wire, a &s;word-blade, &amp;c. when &s;truck in the &s;ame manner, and applied to the teeth. Moreover, that we di&s;tinctly hear
<PB N="28" REF="36">all the tones or notes of a mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment, when played upon, on taking it in the teeth, or touching it with a wire, &s;word-blade, &amp;c. held in the &s;ame man|ner. Travellers, who happen to &s;tray in the night, upon laying the head, e&s;peci|ally the hinder part, clo&s;e to the earth, may hear di&s;tinctly, at the di&s;tance of a German mile or more, people going, ri|ding, or travelling. In this manner, &s;ome of the inhabitants of <HI>Halle</HI> could, on the neighbouring eminences, hear all the can|non fired in the glorious battle of <HI>Ro&s;bach,</HI> in as di&s;tinct and plain a manner, as if at no great di&s;tance from the action, though at that time full four German miles off. <HI>Conrad Victor Scheider,</HI> &s;o celebrated for his de&s;cription of the muco&s;e glands of the no&s;e, in his book, <HI>De o&s;&s;ibus temporum,</HI> publi&s;hed at Wittemburg in 1653, in 8vo, p. 43, relates the &s;ame thing of &s;ome pea|&s;ants, who &s;ticking their &s;taves in the earth, held one end in their teeth; to wave other in&s;tances at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>All the&s;e experiments &s;ucceed as well, if not better, with deaf per&s;ons, than with tho&s;e that have their hearing: As tho&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="37">la&s;t, upon &s;topping their ears, feel a ting|ling and whizzing from the included air, which the former are without. The proof of this I refer to the experience of all deaf per&s;ons who will make the trial. For, ca&s;es, where deafne&s;s cannot be relieved by this method, and which I &s;hall men|tion towards the conclu&s;ion, are very rare: Nay, the practice of &s;etting the mouth wide open, in difficulty of hearing, in or|der more di&s;tinctly to hear, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure reducible hither: Though, in explaining this ob&s;ervation, I mu&s;t differ from very great phy&s;icians, who would ac|count for this manner of hearing, &s;olely from the air in&s;inuated into the <HI>tuba Eu|&s;tachii;</HI> which I &s;hall more fully treat be|low.</P>
<P>That the methods of hearing but ju&s;t mentioned, without the u&s;e of the ordi|nary organs of hearing, has been confirm|ed by the repeated ob&s;ervations of phy&s;i|cians and inquirers into nature, I &s;hall briefly illu&s;trate from &s;ome credible hi&s;to|ries, which may, at the &s;ame time clear up, and &s;hew the different application of the method I am now upon. <HI>Boerhaave,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="38">a man, who&s;e te&s;timony is every where unexceptionable, tells us in his <HI>Praelecti|ones academicae in proprias in&s;titutiones me|dicas,</HI> T. IV. p. 414. according to Hal|ler's edition, of a deaf Mu&s;ician, who, laying hold with his teeth in the upper parts of his lute, at the tuning pegs, played in a manner perfectly ju&s;t, and ac|cording to all the rules of art, without the lea&s;t mi&s;take or blunder. Like in|&s;tances we have in <HI>Ingra&s;&s;ias,</HI> in his <HI>Com|mentarii in Galeni librum de o&s;&s;ibus, Schelha|mer</HI> in his book <HI>De auditu,</HI> and in <HI>Du Verney,</HI> in his treati&s;e on hearing.</P>
<P><HI>Du Verney,</HI> ju&s;t now mentioned, as al&s;o <HI>De Lanis,</HI> in his <HI>Magi&s;t. natur. &amp; artis,</HI> p. 928, and others, have farther ob&s;erved, that deaf per&s;ons have been enabled to hear extremely well, if, in &s;peaking, one &s;hould direct the &s;ound over and again&s;t the head. A curious in&s;tance of this we find in the <HI>Ephemerides academ. nat. curio&s;or. decur.</HI> i. <HI>ann.</HI> i. <HI>ob&s;erv.</HI> xxxv. which is the more remarkable, as the principal cir|cum&s;tance therein lies buried in the rub|bi&s;h of trifling quack medicines. <HI>Ema|nuel Ramire&s;ius de Cariour,</HI> a Spaniard, is
<PB N="31" REF="39">the inventor of this method, of whom <HI>Petrus a Ca&s;tro,</HI> phy&s;ician to one of the Dukes of Mantua, learned it, and to whom we owe the account. The whole of it con&s;i&s;ted in the following particulars. In the fir&s;t place, the patient, according as his con&s;titution might require, was to u&s;e a proper laxative, and then once or twice a &s;omewhat &s;tronger purgative; after which the head was to be &s;haved at the coronal &s;uture, for a hand's-breadth, and often rubbed, e&s;pecially morning and eve|ning, with the following &s;alve: Take three ounces of the be&s;t brandy, two drams of purified &s;altpetre, one ounce of oil of bitter almonds, &s;et the whole to boil gently, till all the brandy is evaporated, then pour to it an ounce of orange water, <HI>(aqua naphae)</HI> &s;tir it with a &s;patula, till it turns of the con&s;i&s;tence of a thin &s;alve. La&s;tly, early every morning the patient mu&s;t clean, perfectly well, his head and eyes, and clear his ears and no&s;e, rin&s;e his mouth, and chew &s;ome ma&s;tich, or other fragrant &s;ub&s;tance, and then do his hair back with an ivory comb; this done, the &s;peaker is to direct his voice ju&s;t over the &s;haven
<PB N="32" REF="40">part, and the deaf per&s;on comes to hear perfectly and di&s;tinctly every word that is &s;poken: And thus the deaf learn, not only to hear, but to &s;peak. The rea&s;on of all this, will appear below.</P>
<P>But as the methed of <HI>Ramire&s;ius</HI> is at|tended with many inconveniences, and as it mu&s;t be very trouble&s;ome, not only to the patient, on account of &s;uch antecedent preparation, but to the &s;peaker al&s;o. The following methods of producing this &s;en&s;e, by means of &s;ome ela&s;tic body held to the teeth, claim, by much, the preference: Of this the experiments adduced above are &s;ufficient proofs. But the following account, taken from the <HI>Bre&s;law collection, E&s;&s;ay</HI> 21. p. 330. is &s;till a fuller proof. A man at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> had, by di&s;temper, lo&s;t his hearing, to &s;uch a degree, as not to have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of firing of cannon, the beating ever &s;o many drums, nor of any other the mo&s;t violent motions: At la&s;t, he accidentally fell on a method, by which he could perfectly well under&s;tand any &s;peaker, and write down all that he &s;aid; and this he did by means of a &s;tick of wood, of a moderate length, one end of
<PB N="33" REF="41">which he held to, or took in his teeth, re&s;t|ing the other end again&s;t the place where the &s;peaker &s;tood. And thus at church he could under&s;tand the preacher, and write down the &s;ermon, upon &s;eating him&s;elf ju&s;t under the pulpit, with his face towards it, and one end of the &s;tick, while the other was between his teeth, re&s;ting again&s;t the foot of the pulpit.</P>
<P>About ten years &s;ince, <HI>John Paul Bau|mer,</HI> a young phy&s;ician of <HI>Franconia,</HI> un|dertook to improve this method: And in a writing, which we &s;hall pre&s;ently men|tion, he pretended, he him&s;elf had devi&s;ed the whole of the method, explaining it from the nature of the &s;en&s;e of hearing, and from the different manner of propa|gating &s;ounds; but now and then &s;ome|thing e&s;capes him, which bewrays, that he was not altogether unacquainted with that which others had attempted before him in that way. He publi&s;hed his me|thod in an inaugural di&s;putation at Erfurt in 1749, under the following title, <HI>Pro|dromus methodi &s;urdos a nativitate faclendi audientes &amp; loquentes.</HI> The whole con&s;i&s;ts in taking a &s;tick, made of an ela&s;tic body,
<PB N="34" REF="42">or gla&s;s, &s;teel, copper, bell-metal, &s;ilver, &amp;c. flat and broad at both ends, to pre|vent its touching the lips; and being thus made fit for the due propagation of &s;ound, one end of this &s;tick the deaf per&s;on takes between his teeth, and the &s;peaker the other, with this precaution, however, that neither of them &s;hall touch the &s;tick with the tongue or lips: In this manner, the deaf per&s;on hears every word that is uttered.</P>
<P>In order the more fully to e&s;tabli&s;h the utility of this method, the author gives an in&s;tance in his &s;econd remark, &sect; 6. of a young woman of twenty-four, who learned to hear in this manner, though with an old ru&s;ty piece of a &s;word-blade, about two feet long: For, upon pro|nouncing only a few words, &s;he, with a &s;mile, and pointing to her head, inti|mated, that &s;he perceived every word that was &s;aid, and directly attempted to imi|tate them. But, as there are many defects in this method, as namely, that the &s;tick mu&s;t not be touched either with the lips or the tongue, in which ca&s;e, all the lin|gual and labial letters, as b, d, f, l, m,
<PB N="35" REF="43">&amp;c mu&s;t be uttered indi&s;tinctly; to obviate which, the author, indeed, has, &sect; 15 and 17. of his di&s;putation, propo&s;ed another method, by u&s;ing an acou&s;tic tube, and a &s;peaking trumpet. If the fir&s;t, the deaf per&s;on mu&s;t take it in his teeth, and the &s;peaker mu&s;t pronounce at the wide end of the tube; which purpo&s;e a common funnel will an&s;wer as well: But if a &s;peaking trumpet, the deaf per&s;on mu&s;t open his mouth very wide, while the &s;peaker, who pronounces through it, holds its upper broad part clo&s;e to the teeth of the deaf per&s;on, yet without touching them.</P>

<P>TO conclude, all the methods hither|to metioned under this &s;econd cla&s;s, are rendered far more commodious, more perfect, and of far more general utility, by con&s;idering a peculiar in&s;tance of an ingenious deaf per&s;on, who gave the great|e&s;t

I am not, indeed, the fir&s;t who publi&s;hed the account, and an explana|tion of it; as an unknown author, under the initial letters C, F, W. has already de&s;cribed it in the Harlem Journal for the year 1754, <HI>p</HI> 393. <HI>&s;eqq.</HI> but as both his hi&s;torical part is erroneous and imperfect, and the explanation of its circum&s;tances, and the ob&s;ervations made thereon, are groundle&s;s and fal&s;e; I had the whole matter more fully and more ju&s;tly de|&s;cribed, a year and an half &s;ince, in an academical di&s;putation, defended under my pre&s;ident&s;hip, with the following title, <HI>Di&s;&s;ertatio &s;i&s;tens novae methodi, &s;urdos red|dendi audientes, phy&s;icas &amp; medicas rationes.</HI> But as &s;uch di&s;&s;ertations &s;eldom come into the hands of any, but of phy&s;icians, I &s;hall here, fir&s;t, relate the hi&s;tory of this deaf per&s;on, in all its circum&s;tances, toge|ther with the manner in which he reco|vered his hearing. Then, &s;econdly, give a rational explanation, grounded on phy|&s;ical
<PB N="37" REF="45">&s;ical and medical principles, of all the incidental circum&s;tances ob&s;ervable there|in.</P>
<P>A reputable merchant of <HI>We&s;el,</HI> in the Duchy of <HI>Cleves,</HI> a venerable, hoary, old man of &s;eventy-eight, had, as early as his twentieth year, a great difficulty of hearing, which, as far as he could recollect, was occa&s;ioned, either by a violent fall, or by a profu&s;e bleeding at the no&s;e. The mo&s;t promi&s;ing means again&s;t this di&s;order proved ineffectual, it rather growing upon him from year to year, till, at la&s;t, he became quite deaf, unable to under&s;tand a &s;ingle word, without bawling loud in his ears. Both German and Dutch phy&s;i|cians, who were con&s;ulted on this occa|&s;ion, could not, with all their art and &s;kill, afford any relief: At length, after an accurate examination of the external organs of hearing, the ca&s;e was deemed incurable. However, he procured a variety of acou&s;tic tubes from Am&s;terdam, in order to afford &s;ome relief to tho&s;e who wanted to &s;peak with him: But their u&s;e was afterwards laid a&s;ide, as being attended either with
<PB N="38" REF="46">much inconvenience, or as never procu|ring any di&s;tinct degree of hearing.</P>
<P>Afterwards marrying, and having two of his elde&s;t children, a &s;on and a daugh|ter, taught to play on the &s;pinnet, he often came up to it, and eagerly wi&s;hed to hear the mu&s;ic: As the mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter once happened to &s;ay, that it was very po&s;&s;ible for him to hear, if, according to an old, and well known experiment, he held a thin &s;tick, or a tobacco-pipe, with the one end on the bridge of the &s;ound-board, and with the other to the upper teeth; this he in&s;tantly tried, and was greatly plea&s;ed, that he could both plainly di|&s;tingui&s;h each note, and, as he thought, much &s;tronger than formerly, at his be&s;t hearing. But all this was ineffectual to make him under&s;tand per&s;ons &s;peaking, till an accidental trial procured him al&s;o this happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the year 1749, he had the good fortune to light, by mere accident, on a peculiar method, by which any per&s;on, at the di&s;tance of twenty, or even thirty paces, may, without greatly &s;training his voice, &s;peak to be under&s;tood. This
<PB N="39" REF="47">happened as follows: As one time this deaf per&s;on had all his family about him, and was plea&s;ing him&s;elf with his daugh|ter's playing, by means of his tobacco|pipe; his brother, who happened to be pre&s;ent, alledged, that as he could plainly di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ounds or notes of the &s;pin|net, he might al&s;o, in the &s;ame manner, under&s;tand the articulate &s;ounds of a &s;pea|ker. For this purpo&s;e, his brother took a &s;peaking-trumpet, and holding the nar|row part, or mouth-piece, to the upper teeth of the deaf per&s;on, he uttered a few words at the upper or wider part thereof: This trial, however, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, the deaf man not being &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t articulate &s;ound. But he him&s;elf directly fell upon a device, which proved more &s;ucce&s;sful. The brother was to hold the rim of the wide end of the &s;peaking-trum|pet to his upper teeth, and he him&s;elf to do the like with the lower end, or mouth|piece: Upon which, his brother had &s;carce uttered a couple of words, but he directly repeated them with the greate&s;t joy, and al&s;o a&s;&s;ured him, that he under|stood them more di&s;tinctly than if he had
<PB N="40" REF="48">bawled them in the loude&s;t manner in his ear.</P>
<P>The deaf man did not &s;top here: In order to be convinced, whether the &s;uc|ce&s;s was not owing to the &s;tructure of the &s;peaking-trumpet, or whether the &s;ame thing might not &s;ucceed with other bo|dies; he directly tried, in the &s;ame man|ner, his tobacco-pipe, and a little wood|en &s;tick, and to his great joy found it not only po&s;&s;ible, but that the &s;peaker might even &s;peak as low as he plea&s;ed, &s;o the voice were only audible. The curio&s;ity of this man and his friends did not re&s;t here; they wanted to know, at what di|&s;tance one might conver&s;e with him: For this purpo&s;e, they took thin &s;ticks or &s;lips of wood, of different lengths, and one, in particular, &s;ix feet long, an inch broad, and of the thicken&s;s of the back of a knife. At We&s;el, and in the coun|try round about, they call &s;uch &s;ticks flooring-&s;lips or laths, which they u&s;e in filling up the openings of the boards of the flooring, when &s;tarting a&s;under: And &s;uch &s;lips are the more commodious, as being thin, they the le&s;s hinder the pro|nunciation,
<PB N="41" REF="49">and as in other re&s;pects, they produce the &s;ame effect in propagating &s;ound: And even, by means of a bundle of them tied together, the lowe&s;t &s;ound is di&s;tinctly audible, when the by-&s;tanders can &s;carce perceive any.</P>
<P>The farther trials and ob&s;ervations, which were made in the u&s;e of this me|thod, have been confirmed by the follow|ing experiments. In the fir&s;t place, upon bawling in the loude&s;t manner, in the mouth of the deaf per&s;on, through a large tin funnel, without touching the teeth, or even without the funnel, not a &s;ingle word was under&s;tood. Secondly, if the &s;lip of wood be held too fa&s;t with the finger, or laid hold on with &s;hut lips, the voice proves very indi&s;tinct. But thirdly, if held with the teeth, the &s;en&s;ation is extremely weak. Fourthly, if the &s;lip be held to the under teeth, there is not the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of hearing. Whereas, fifthly, the voice is perceptible and di&s;tinct, upon bringing, in u&s;ing the &s;lip, the tongue to the palate or to the teeth. Sixthly, the voice is le&s;s perceptible on joining the teeth together, than on their &s;tanding a&s;under. Seventhly, though the mouth be full of water, the
<PB N="42" REF="50">hearing is not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed. Eighthly, when a bra&s;s or iron wire is held to the teeth, the deaf per&s;on hears nothing at all; but held between the teeth, a lit|tle. Ninthly, the deaf per&s;on may hear very well, on holding, by the lower rim, a beer-gla&s;s, to the upper teeth; or if, with the mouth &s;hut, he pre&s;&s;es it &s;ome|what hard ju&s;t under the no&s;e, and ano|ther per&s;on directs his voice up the gla&s;s, clo&s;e to it; all which an&s;wers not with a wine-gla&s;s. Tenthly and la&s;tly, the &s;pea|ker mu&s;t have good &s;ound teeth, with|out any loo&s;e ones, at lea&s;t in the upper jaw, as then the voice is very indi&s;tinct.</P>
<P>As the explanation of all the methods hitherto treated, and the ob&s;ervations oc|ca&s;ionally offering thereon, are founded on the three phy&s;ical and medical propo|&s;itions, advanced above; all that is nece&s;|&s;ary here, is to make a clo&s;er application of them to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and from the con&s;equences thence drawn, give a &s;ufficient proof of the commodiou&s;ne&s;s and utility of the la&s;t method propo&s;ed, to procure hearing to the deaf. And thus, in the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall briefly handle
<PB N="43" REF="51">the propagation of &s;ound, &s;o far as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Secondly, mention tho&s;e parts of the body, which either ob&s;truct, or promote this propaga|tion. Thirdly, deduce from their &s;everal cau&s;es the peculiar ob&s;ervations, made in the foregoing paragraph. Fourthly and la&s;tly, determine briefly tho&s;e ca&s;es, in which the application of this method does not take place.</P>
<P>Inquirers into nature &s;hew, that the propagation of &s;ound depends principally on ela&s;tic bodies, that is, &s;uch, who&s;e parts re&s;i&s;t the action .of another body upon them, and which, when thereby altered in &s;ituation, re&s;tore them&s;elves to their former &s;tate, from a force, not ari&s;ing from their gravity, but peculiar to them. For, &s;ound is nothing other but the tremulous, or vibratory motion, ari&s;ing from ela&s;ti|city, of the minute&s;t air-particles, whereby a peculiar &s;en&s;ation is produced in the au|ditory organs. Now, as this vibratory motion, and the &s;ound produced thereby, are &s;olely owing to the ela&s;ticity of bodies, we may thence fairly infer, that all ela&s;tic bodies are &s;onorous; for in&s;tance, gla&s;s,
<PB N="44" REF="52">bell-metal, copper, &s;ilver, &s;teel, &amp;c. But, in order to one body's acting upon ano|ther, they mu&s;t come either into mediate or immediate contact with each other. For, action at di&s;tance, <HI>actio in di&s;tans,</HI> is both, by phy&s;ical and metaphy&s;ical prin|ciples, a non-entity, a mere fancy. Now, as daily experience &s;hews, that &s;ound takes its ri&s;e at a di&s;tance from the ear, and thus only mediately, namely, by ano|ther intervening body, puts in motion the auditory organs; it follows hence, that the body producing this mediate ef|fect, mu&s;t be ela&s;tic, as the propagation of &s;ound is not po&s;&s;ible by means of any other body.</P>
<P>The ela&s;tic body, which commonly propagates &s;ound, is the air; but it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this virtue from no other quality, but from that of its ela&s;ticity. Con&s;equently, all ela&s;tic bodies without exception an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, &s;o that they only affect the organs of hearing, or are continuous with them. Of this we have undoubted proof from well-known expe|riments. Be&s;ides the in&s;tances adduced above, it is a thing we may daily ob|&s;erve
<PB N="45" REF="53">in mu&s;ical in&s;truments. The tremor or vibration, imparted to the &s;tring of a &s;pinnet or violin, and the like in&s;truments, is propagated from it to the bridge, and thence again to the &s;ound-board; and in the in&s;tance we are now upon, from the bridge of the &s;pinnet to the tobacco-pipe, and thence farther on, till it reaches, and puts into a &s;imilar motion, the organs of hearing; and the parts them&s;elves of our body are adapted for this propagation. For in&s;tance, hang a little bell, cymbal, pair of tongs, &amp;c. by means of a metal wire or gut-&s;tring, on the finger, and with that finger &s;top the ear, and &s;trike upon or move any of the&s;e bodies, and the &s;ound is perfectly well perceived: Or take a watch by the chain between the teeth, and &s;top the ears clo&s;e, and you will very di|&s;tinctly hear it go.</P>
<P>As in the&s;e ca&s;es, the &s;ound is propa|gated from the mouth to the ear, though the air, which is put in motion, is no ways connected with the external ear; in that ca&s;e it mu&s;t be, that the parts of the head, lying between the mouth and the organ of hearing, are the means of
<PB N="46" REF="54">propagation. But as it is well known from phy&s;ical grounds, that &s;oft parts, &s;u&s;ceptible of little or no degree of vibra|tion, are not only in them&s;elves incapable of propagating &s;ound, but even ob&s;truct, or, at lea&s;t, dimini&s;h its farther propaga|tion, when happening to interrupt the connection of the hard and ela&s;tic parts: The hard and ela&s;tic parts, therefore, of the body, uninterrupted in their clo&s;e connection or continuity by the inter|vention of &s;ofter parts, are alone fitte&s;t for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now briefly mention, as I pro|mi&s;ed above, all the&s;e hard parts of the head, with their &s;everal connections with each other; from all which, their capa|city or incapacity to propagate &s;ound will be more ea&s;ily and certainly determined; and &s;hall begin with the under parts, where, according to the experiments above mentioned, the communication and pro|pagation of &s;ound took its ri&s;e; and thus &s;hall proceed to the upper parts. And fir&s;t, the teeth offer to con&s;ideration, which are parts extremely hard and firm, and by an articulation, called <HI>gompho&s;is,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="55">wedged or fixed immoveably in their ca|vities or &s;ockets, in both the jaw-bones, &s;o as not to drop out even in a &s;keleton. In the &s;econd place, follows the under jaw-bone, both who&s;e <HI>apophy&s;es condyloi|deae</HI> are obliquely in&s;erted in the <HI>fovea gle|noides</HI> of the temporal bone, and move over the oblique eminence of the &s;ame bone, by means of the <HI>cartilago interar|ticularis.</HI> Thirdly, the upper maxillary bones come to be con&s;idered, who&s;e hin|der and inner part is immediatly connected with the <HI>apophy&s;es pterygoides</HI> of the <HI>os &s;phenoides;</HI> but the fore-part firmly con|nected with the palatine to the <HI>o&s;&s;a palati,</HI> and with the zygomatic proce&s;&s;es to the <HI>os zygomaticum.</HI> Then, fourthly, follows the ju&s;t mentioned <HI>os jugale,</HI> or <HI>zygomati|cum,</HI> which, by a peculiar proce&s;s, is clo&s;ely connected, backwards, with the temporal bone. Fifthly, the palatine bones are connected with the <HI>os cuneiforme</HI> by the pterygoidal proce&s;&s;es. Sixthly, the <HI>os cuneiforme</HI> lies in the middle, between the &s;aid bones, and forms, as it were, the common copula or tie of the&s;e and of the temporal bones; &s;eeing it is connected
<PB N="48" REF="56">forwards with the palatine bones by the pterygoid proce&s;&s;es, and by the temporal proce&s;&s;es, called by &s;ome the greater wing of the os cuneiforme, with the <HI>os &s;quamo|&s;um</HI> and <HI>petro&s;um</HI> of the temporal bone. Hence, &s;eventhly, it appears, that the temporal bone is immediately connected with the <HI>os jugale</HI> and <HI>cuneiforme,</HI> and me|diately with the palatine bones, and both the maxillary bones, and with the teeth; yet &s;o, as that the connection with the inferior maxillary is interrupted by an in|terpo&s;ing cartilage. Eighthly, the con|nection of the temporal with the other bones of the cranium, as the <HI>o&s;&s;a frontis, &s;incipitis,</HI> and <HI>occipitis,</HI> is either mediate, by means of the <HI>os cuneiforme,</HI> or imme|diate, by means of the &s;utures; which la&s;t, in more advanced years, intirely di&s;|appear. Ninthly and la&s;tly, to this head we refer the <HI>tuba Eu&s;tachii,</HI> a canal, part|ly bony, partly cartilaginous, and partly membranous, and clo&s;ely connected with the temporal bone.</P>
<P>From this connection of bones, we may plainly &s;ee, that &s;ound is propagated by &s;uch of them, as are continuous, and
<PB N="49" REF="57">clo&s;ely connected together, and are, as much as may be, either bare and naked, or only covered with thinly expanded &s;oft parts: Of this kind are principally the upper teeth, then the upper maxillary bone; al&s;o all the bones of the cranium, when &s;tript of their hair, and their other &s;ofter parts, are a little &s;tretched, either by the hand, or &s;ome a&s;tringent. And this is the foundation of <HI>Ramire&s;ius'</HI> method, very ea&s;ily explicable from that which we have ju&s;t &s;aid. On the contrary, where there is neither no perfect and continuous connection of bones with each other, par|ticularly with the temporal, which con|tains the internal ear, or where too many &s;ofter parts lie round or between the bones, the propagation of vibratory motion, and con&s;equently of &s;ound, is, according to phy|&s;ical principles, impo&s;&s;ible: On this ac|count, neither the under maxillary bone, nor the <HI>tuba Eu&s;tachii,</HI> can properly propa|gate &s;ound. Of the la&s;t we are, moreover, to ob&s;erve, that being membranous from the pterygoid proce&s;&s;es to its opening into the mouth, and partly al&s;o lax, and on that account exhibiting a &s;omewhat collap&s;ed
<PB N="50" REF="58">pa&s;&s;age, the vibrating air cap neither be conveyed in &s;ufficient quantity, to the cavity of the drum, nor produce in it the due vibratory motion.</P>
<P>As &s;ound may be propagated by all ela|&s;tic bodies, in clo&s;e connection or con|tact with each other; &s;o in this ca&s;e may be of &s;ervice all thin &s;lips of wood, Spa|ni&s;h reeds, &s;word-blades, tobacco-pipes, &amp;c. when pre&s;&s;ed to the above-mentioned hard and ela&s;tic parts of the head, which &s;tand connected with the temporal bones. Now, as among all the ela&s;tic bodies ju&s;t mentioned, the fibres of wood are remark|ably tough and flexible, and on account of their loo&s;e and open texture, give no great re&s;i&s;tance to vibratory motions, but rather afford them greater &s;cope; &s;o thin &s;lips of wood, or &s;lender Spani&s;h reeds, are be&s;t adapted for the purpo&s;es of propagating &s;ound to the ela&s;tic parts of the head, and to the organs of hearing.</P>
<P>From the principles hitherto advanced, may be explained all tho&s;e experiments, which were made on occa&s;ion of actually employing this method, and briefly recited above. The fir&s;t experiment, either with
<PB N="51" REF="59">the large funnel, or with barely &s;peaking into the mouth of the deaf per&s;on, in or|der to produce the &s;en&s;e of hearing, mi&s;|carried in the execution: For, as in this ca&s;e, the air alone is to communicate to the teeth, and other ela&s;tic parts connect|ed with them; a vibratory motion; it is in general unfit for this purpo&s;e, as it comes greatly rarified from the mouth of the &s;peaker, and con&s;equently, greatly dimi|ni&s;hed in activity and ela&s;ticity: Be&s;ides; from the property common to all forced fluids, as &s;oon as it has e&s;caped the mouth of the &s;peaker, it expands every way, and thereby becomes &s;till more weakened in its efficacy, and con&s;equently cannot, in that ca&s;e, overcome the re&s;i&s;tance of the teeth, and other ela&s;tic parts of the mouth of a deaf per&s;on, nor put them into vibra|tory motion, &s;ufficient to produce the &s;en&s;e of hearing.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, third, and &s;ixth experi|ments, in which the voice proved too weak and imperceptible to the deaf man, when the &s;lips of wood were held too fa&s;t with the &s;ingers, or &s;hut lips and teeth, as al&s;o when held to the &s;hut teeth, may be
<PB N="52" REF="60">explained in the &s;ame manner. From the foregoing propo&s;itions it is evident, that the &s;ofter parts of our body interrupt the progre&s;s of &s;ound, receiving indeed the vibratory motion, but for want of the re|qui&s;ite re-action not propagating it far enough: And for this there is al&s;o ano|ther rea&s;on, namely, that in the three for|mer methods of applying the &s;lip of wood, the &s;ame degree of force mu&s;t put in mo|tion a far greater quantity of the vibratory air, than can happen in different and op|po&s;ite circum&s;tances, whence, of nece&s;&s;ity, a le&s;s effect mu&s;t en&s;ue: Now, as in the third and &s;ixth experiments, a greater &s;hare of vibration is lo&s;t in the under jaw-bone, the &s;en&s;ation thereof mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be extremely weak and indi&s;tinct.</P>
<P>And this farther explains the fourth ex|periment, by which the deaf per&s;on per|ceived not the lea&s;t &s;ound, on holding the &s;lip to the under teeth. To explain this ob&s;ervation there can be no difficulty, when we recollect the connection of the under jaw-bone with the temporal: The under jaw-bone having its connection with the re&s;t of the bones of the head, only by
<PB N="53" REF="61">means of &s;oft interpo&s;ing parts, namely, a &s;oft cartilage, which, be&s;ides, on account of the con&s;tant moi&s;tne&s;s of tho&s;e parts, is lower, receiving, indeed, the vibratory motion, but directly again lo&s;ing it, and, as it were, deadening it, in its &s;ofter &s;ub|&s;tance, for want of the requi&s;ite re-action; how is it po&s;&s;ible then to expect any alte|ration in the other bones of the head from the vibratory motion of this bone?</P>
<P>The fifth experiment, on the contrary, is &s;omewhat more difficult to explain: For, as here the tongue, a &s;ofter part, is brought to the palate and teeth, and yet that which another utters remains di&s;tinct and perceptible to the deaf per&s;on, it &s;hould &s;eem, that this experiment contra|dicts the &s;econd, third, and &s;ixth.</P>
<P>But here we are to con&s;ider, that, in the fir&s;t place, the tongue is applied be|hind the teeth. 2dly, That all &s;oft parts, as fully appears from phy&s;ics, receive not &s;uch a quantity of vibratory motion, as do hard bodies: Whence it is, as the teeth are as it were wedged in the upper ma|xillary bone, being a hard part, the greate&s;t &s;hare of vibration will go to the jaw, and
<PB N="54" REF="62">only a &s;maller &s;hare thereof to the tongue: But, if you &s;lip the tongue forwards over the teeth, the &s;ame thing happens as in lips together; either no &s;ound at all, or but very indi&s;tinctly, being perceivable by the deaf per&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh ob&s;ervation, namely, that the hearing is not dimini&s;hed, though the mouth be full of water, is ea&s;ily accounted for; as we learn from philo&s;ophy, that there is much ela&s;tic air in water, adapted for the propagation of &s;ound; as &s;uffici|ently appears from the example of divers, who, under water; perceive the &s;ound produced above water: Now, as water perfectly encrea&s;es the continuity of the parts in the mouth, and propagates the vibrations produced by &s;ound from the teeth to the maxillary bones, and the pterygoid proce&s;&s;es of the <HI>os cuneiforme,</HI> we may, from the connection of the&s;e parts with the temporal bones, ea&s;ily judge, that the &s;en&s;ation of &s;ound is rather heigh|tened than dimini&s;hed by the water in the mouth.</P>
<P>In order to explain the eighth experi|ment, which was made with a bra&s;s or
<PB N="55" REF="63">iron wire, two things, in particular, are to be remarked; fir&s;t, that &s;uch metal &s;trings or wires are a great deal firmer than wood, and con&s;equently require a greater degree of force, in order to vibrate, than is po&s;&s;ible to be produced by the air in &s;peaking: Secondly, that their ba&s;e of contact with the teeth is by much too &s;mall, for them to communicate a &s;uffici|ent degree of motion to the whole range of bones reaching quite to the ear: And this is the very rea&s;on, that by laying hold on it with the teeth, the points of contact being encrea&s;ed, the deaf per&s;on comes to have &s;ome degree of &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>The happy effects produced with the beer-gla&s;s, and the un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts with the wine-gla&s;s, which was the ninth experiment, &s;eem to depend, either on the greater compa&s;s of the former, or on &s;ome degree of compre&s;&s;ion pro|duced in the air &s;poken into it, which thereby communicates its vibratory motions and repercu&s;&s;ions to the ela&s;tic gla&s;s, and by that means to the teeth and upper jaw|bone, though the lips interpo&s;e or lie be|tween, as they acquire a greater degree of
<PB N="56" REF="64">clo&s;ene&s;s in their texture, and greater &s;u&s;|ceptibility to propagate &s;ound, by the greater degree of pre&s;&s;ion, made on them with the rim of the gla&s;s: Whereas, a le&s;s portion of air goes into the wine-gla&s;s, be&s;ides, its compa&s;s is &s;maller, and the greater ma&s;s of foot or &s;talk, dimini&s;hes the motion of the air, &s;o as to prevent its communicating to the teeth a &s;ufficient pitch of vibration. And la&s;tly, the rea&s;on why, according to the tenth ob&s;ervation or experiment, the loo&s;e teeth of the upper jaw rendered &s;peaking indi&s;tinct to the deaf per&s;on, is ea&s;ily under&s;tood, when we reflect, that, in order to propagate a vibra|tory motion, a clo&s;er continuity of ela&s;tic parts is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>As the &s;en&s;ation, which is perceived in the act of hearing, produced by the me|thods of the &s;econd order of the &s;econd cla&s;s, &s;eems to be formed almo&s;t in the middle of the brain, backwards at the <HI>me|dulla oblongata,</HI> we may hence, according to anatomical grounds, judge, that the vi|brations produced by &s;ound, put the audi|tory nerves in &s;en&s;ation, from the <HI>os petro|&s;um,</HI> quite to their origin: And hence
<PB N="57" REF="65">ari&s;es this practical propo&s;ition, that the ea&s;y method we have been hitherto upon, to procure hearing to the deaf, is adapted to all per&s;ons afflicted with deafne&s;s, be the other auditory organs injured how they may, provided the auditory nerves are not ob|&s;tructed, injured, or quite de&s;troyed at their origin: For, this la&s;t is the only ca&s;e, in which the pre&s;ent method is not applicable, and on &s;uch melancholy objects all labour and pains are lo&s;t.</P>
