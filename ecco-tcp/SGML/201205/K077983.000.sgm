<P>I could with great facility recriminate upon my Enemies, but I never thought a <HI>Billings-Gate Dialect</HI> any Ornament, or an advantageous Character to a Sober Chri|ftian, which is &s;eldom u&s;ed, but by a bui&s;y &s;ort of <HI>Tatling</HI> Animals, who are out of Humour with every Body, becau&s;e their own ill nature will not &s;uffer 'em to be
<PB N="9" REF="8">pleas'd with them&s;elves. Let <HI>Maevius</HI> and <HI>Bavius</HI> then admire one another, and rail at all the World be&s;ides; I &s;hall for the future be unconcern'd at tho&s;e who are as full of unju&s;t Reproaches, as they are void of good Breeding.

<L><HI>At lea&s;t regard it with a &s;cornful Smile;</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twere mean to think of Vengeance on the Vile.</HI></L></Q>
<P>However, &s;ince I know not how far their Hatred, inveterate and implacable <HI>Malice</HI> may extend to my prejudice, among tho&s;e that know not my <HI>veritable</HI> Character, I &s;hall here employ a few Lines to an&s;wer all the Objections they have <HI>rai&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly</HI> &s;catter'd to bla&s;t my Reputation in the Practice of Phy&s;ick, which I have followed with great Succe&s;s for many Years, and which the wor&s;t of my Enemies cannot de|ny, without a&s;&s;urance enough to affirm, that the Sun is not ri&s;en, when to their <HI>&s;hame,</HI> it &s;hines in their Faces from its Illu&s;trious Meridian.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections again&s;t the Author.</NOTE>The fir&s;t Quarter in which my profe&s;&s;ed Enemies attack me, is, <HI>That I am but an Apothecary:</HI> 'Tis true, I lay claim to no greater Title, and yet cannot forbear &s;ay|ing, That that Objection is <HI>Ridiculous;</HI> &s;ince being an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> well versd in <HI>Phar|macy,</HI> in the Knowledge of <HI>Drugs,</HI> and the <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of Medicines, is, the mo&s;t cer|tain
<PB N="10" REF="9">and regular &s;tep towards the making of a good Phy&s;ician: As has been proved by many Examples in <HI>London</HI> and other Places, where Men that &s;ervd their Times to Apothecaries, and kept Shop many Years, have afterwards took their Degree of <HI>Doctor</HI> in one of our own Univer&s;ities, and pra|cti&s;ed with as great Applau&s;e, and it may be with more <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> than the re&s;t of their <HI>only</HI> Graduated Brethren. Nor is this method unob&s;erved in other Learned Employments; for many Wi&s;e Men &s;ay, That the way to make an able <HI>Coun&s;ellor,</HI> is, Fir&s;t to educate him as a <HI>Clerk</HI> to an <HI>At|torney.</HI> Having thus blown off this igno|rant and contemptible Objection, I proceed to the Second; which is, <HI>That I never had, an &V;niver&s;ity Education, but am a mere Ignoramus,</HI> as they are pleas'd to Phra&s;e it; But how will they prove their latter Allegation? Did they ever Examine into my Learning and Ability? Do they know my Incapa|city to perform what I undertake? If they did, without doubt I &s;hould long &s;ince have heard of it in <HI>louder</HI> Terms, than by Private Whi&s;pers, Malicious In&s;inuations and Secret Calumnies and A&s;per&s;ions; but &s;uch is their Hatred, that what they dare not aver to my Face, or attempt to prove by <HI>Argument,</HI> they liberally &s;upply by fal&s;e Reports, and forged Clande&s;tine Stories of my In&s;ufficiency, again&s;t a Thou&s;and <HI>credible</HI> Certificates and <HI>Reputable</HI> Te&s;timonies to the contrary; and the&s;e I think &s;ufficient to &s;top the Mouths of <HI>Detraction</HI> and <HI>Envy,</HI> in the Opinion of all good People; and for o|thers, that are <HI>mi&s;lead</HI> by my <HI>Numerous</HI> Ad|ver&s;aries into <HI>uncharitable</HI> Cen&s;ures of me;
<PB N="11" REF="10">let them but con&s;ider, that my Enemies treat me on the &s;core of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> for my &s;afe and &s;hort way of <HI>Practice,</HI> and a great number of Patients dimini&s;hing their <HI>Profit,</HI> they will not wonder that I am con|demn'd in an <HI>Arbitrary</HI> Court, where <HI>Ma|lice is the Pro&s;ecuter, <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> &s;its as Judge, and &s;ordid <HI>Ignorance</HI> is <HI>Fore-Man</HI> of the Jury.

<P>And that I may contribute to this great <HI>End,</HI> of advancing <HI>u&s;eful</HI> Knowledge in Phy|&s;ick, and that my Enemies may not think I am reduced to a <HI>perpetual</HI> &s;ilence in my own ju&s;t Defence, by their vain <HI>Threatnings</HI> and <HI>injurious</HI> Mi&s;repre&s;entations of my Per&s;on and Capacity for the Practice of Phy&s;ick, I have taken up a re&s;olution to Print &s;e|veral <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> upon <HI>tho&s;e</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es, that God has ble&s;s'd me with the Knowledge of, and given me wonderful &s;ucce&s;s in their Cures, that have frequently baffled the Endeavours of many Eminent <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors:</HI> And &s;hall be|gin with a Treati&s;e upon the CHOLICK.</P>
<P>Now in di&s;cour&s;ing this Subject, to avoid all unnece&s;&s;ary and over Nice and Curious Di&s;tinction, and Definitions, that rather puzzle Men's Intellects, than benefit their Understandings, I &s;hall under the general Name, vulgarly called <HI>Cholick,</HI> treat of it as an Accidental and Particular Di&s;temper, ari&s;ing from an evident Cau&s;e alone, and without a previous di&s;po&s;ition in any Per|&s;on indifferently; for &s;o, alterations in the <HI>Sex No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">naturalia</HI> often rai&s;e great commotions in the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> of the Belly with extremity of Pain: After that, I &s;hall con&s;ider this Di&s;ea&s;e in its <HI>Procartick</HI> or <HI>pre-exi&s;tent</HI> Cau&s;e, as co-operating with others that are &s;ub|&s;equent, which will nece&s;&s;arily lead me to
<PB N="13" REF="12">particular Di&s;cour&s;es upon the various kinds, and the &s;everal Species of this Di&s;temper under the denominations of the Cholick in the <HI>Stomach;</HI> the <HI>Hy&s;terick</HI> Cholick, the <HI>Scor|butick</HI> Cholick; the <HI>Iliack Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> the <HI>Caeliack</HI> Cholick, a <HI>Diarrhea,</HI> a <HI>Lientary,</HI> a <HI>Dy&s;entry,</HI> &amp;c.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The E&s;&s;ence or Nature of the Cho|lick.</NOTE>The Cholick called in <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, in <HI>Latin Collica Pa&s;&s;io,</HI> becau&s;e by &s;ome Phy&s;itians, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, tho' fal&s;ly, to have its &s;eat wholly in &s;ome part or other of the Se|cond of the great Guts, called <HI>Colon;</HI> is a Vellication or &s;evere Griping, Twitching, Gnawing Pain in certain Parts of the <HI>Ab|domen,</HI> which commonly produce Vomit|ings, Cramps and Contractions, almo&s;t of all the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> of the Belly: Sometimes the Navel and its Neighbouring Parts are drawn inward, accompanied with Pains as if they were boared with a Gimlet: Sometimes they &s;well, being blown up with the exce&s;s of Wind: The <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> by an inverted Motion of the <HI>Fibres</HI> are often drawn up|wards, in&s;omuch that the Belly being ex|treamly bound, di&s;charges little or nothing at all; nay, tho' it be frequently provoked to do it by Gly&s;ters and Suppo&s;itories, yet
<PB N="14" REF="13">it does not ea&s;ily throw out its Con|tents.</P>
<P>That the Stomach is likewi&s;e convul&s;ed with the <HI>Duodenum</HI> and Gall Bladder, mani|fe&s;tly appears from the plentiful vomiting of Yellow or Green Choler. Sometimes the <HI>&V;reters</HI> and the Bladder which contains the Urine, are &s;o contracted, that during the whole Fit, the Urine is either &s;topt, or voided more &s;paringly: Be&s;ides, the Head is grieved with <HI>Vertiginous</HI> effects, either preceding or following the inva&s;ion of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and if the Cholick encrea&s;es and becomes <HI>Inveterate,</HI> it often cau&s;es Pain in the outward Members and terminates in a <HI>Pal&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its direful Effects.</NOTE>Nay, the Sick commonly endures all kinds of Pains; one while <HI>burning</HI> with intole|rable <HI>Heat,</HI> another time <HI>chill'd</HI> with extream <HI>Cold;</HI> &s;ometimes it &s;eems to be fix'd and as it were piercing the <HI>Loins,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ther whiles <HI>pricking</HI> with <HI>wandring</HI> repeated <HI>Thru&s;ts;</HI> anon <HI>di&s;tending</HI> or <HI>beating</HI> the Loins, or only <HI>pre&s;&s;ing</HI> them with the <HI>&s;en&s;e of weight,</HI> or <HI>burning, corroding, rending</HI> Pain; or is troubled either with a <HI>continual</HI> or <HI>interrupted Pul&s;ation,</HI> and afterward returning again, or wonder|fully <HI>writhing</HI> and <HI>contorting</HI> any other way, &s;carce to be expre&s;&s;ed by the Patient, or explain'd by the Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Now tho' all the differences occurring in this Di&s;temper with its <HI>Original</HI> are very difficult to be a&s;&s;ign'd, numbred, or re|duced into a certain Order, and much more to make an exact Examination of all the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> and thence to give a &s;ollid judgment of every one; yet I &s;hall attempt it, by exhibiting them from the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Origin of the Cho|lick.</NOTE>Some are of Opinion that the <HI>Origine</HI> of this Di&s;ea&s;e, proceeds from the efferve&s;cency of vicious Blood; others from an Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Capillary</HI> Veins of the Stomach and Guts, by which the <HI>Blood</HI> is forced to &s;tand &s;till in the <HI>Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> till at length after a great <HI>Di&s;tention</HI> the Ve&s;&s;els bur&s;t and the Blood is effu&s;&s;ed, which breeds a &s;en&s;ible Inflamation and violent Pul&s;ation about the Part affected.

<P><HI>Michael Etmuller,</HI> late Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Leipt&s;ick,</HI> &s;ays, Cholick Pains and Gripings in the great Guts, are chiefly felt in the <HI>Colon,</HI> e&s;pecially in that part of it towards the circumference of the Belly, upon the Left-&s;ide, where 'tis &s;trait|ned and incurvated, and con&s;equently more liable to the bla&s;t and &s;hocks of Wind, and more apt to &s;top the Circulation of the Excrements, and cau&s;e their Swelling up in|to a hard or &s;oft <HI>Tumor.</HI> This Pain and Tumor is frequently imputed to the <HI>Spleen,</HI> but erroneou&s;ly; for the <HI>Colon,</HI> &s;ays he, is its u&s;ual and proper Seat; and &s;ometimes it veers about to the Right-&s;ide of the Belly, upon the outermo&s;t Circumference, where the &s;ame <HI>Colon</HI> pur&s;ues its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes the&s;e Pains reach only the Small Guts, and then their Station is about the <HI>Navel</HI> and Centre of the Belly, and are much more violent than tho&s;e in the Great Guts; if they range not beyond the <HI>Duodenum,</HI> or the beginning of the <HI>Jejunum,</HI> they are felt in the <HI>Loins,</HI> and are often mi|&s;taken for <HI>Nephritick</HI> Pains, or tho&s;e cau&s;ed by the Convul&s;ion of the <HI>Me&s;enterick</HI> Nerves, or Tumors, or Ulcers in the <HI>Pancreas.</HI> I dare not &s;ay any of the&s;e Opinions are He|terodox, becau&s;e &s;ometime or other Pains do po&s;&s;e&s;s all the Parts above mention'd.</P>
<P>However, for very good Rea&s;ons grounded upon many Experiments in Anatomy, I ad|here chiefly to Doctor <HI>Willis,</HI> who &s;ays, The Part in Human Bodies <HI>primarily</HI> affected in the Cholick, is the <HI>Me&s;entery,</HI> and its Ner|vous <HI>Foldings</HI> under the Navel, which cau&s;es
<PB N="19" REF="18">cruel Pain, as if a Stake was &s;tuck there, or a Piercer were making a Hole: Be&s;ides, round about, almo&s;t in the whole <HI>Abdomen,</HI> by rea&s;on of the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> being <HI>variou&s;ly</HI> drawn forward and backward, at the &s;ame time in different Places, wandring Pains &s;hoot this way and that way; and the mo|tion of the <HI>Fibres</HI> being di&s;compo&s;ed or in|verted, as well in tho&s;e Parts as in the <HI>pri|mary</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, the Belly is in a manner al|ways bound, and there follows &s;ometimes a &s;upper&s;&s;ion of Urine, or very little is made.

<PB N="47" REF="46">an <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;terical Cholick,</HI> proceeds from a &s;toppage of the <HI>Men&s;es,</HI> a <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> of the Animal Spirits, when too many of them, and contrary to due proportion are violent|ly burried upon this or that part, cau&s;ing Convul&s;ions and Pains, when they ru&s;h up|on Parts of Exqui&s;ite Sen&s;e; to which the cau&s;es of a <HI>Simple</HI> Cholick being added, you have the true Cau&s;es of this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The general method for the Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e, is, fir&s;t to give pre&s;ent Ea&s;e in the <HI>Paroxi&s;ms,</HI> and then proceed to a Cure. To accompli&s;h both the&s;e <HI>Intentions,</HI> 'tis u&s;ual in the fir&s;t place to apply &s;tinking and &s;trong &s;melling things to the No&s;trils, the <HI>Effluvia</HI>'s of which, repre&s;s and reduce to order the Spirits which are grown too <HI>Wild,</HI> and apt to make <HI>exorbitant</HI> efforts; nay, and di&s;cu&s;s their <HI>Heterogeneous</HI> combination, and often wholly exterminate it. <HI>A&s;&s;a Faetida, Ca&s;to|reum, Galbanum,</HI> tyed in a fine Cloth and held to the No&s;trils are proper; al&s;o <HI>Par|tridges</HI> Feathers, or old <HI>Shoes</HI> burnt, or <HI>Sul|phur</HI> kindled; al&s;o the <HI>Spirit and Oil of Soot and Harts-horn</HI> often give Ea&s;e; but the chief Indication in this Di&s;ea&s;e, is to <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> the Blood which is the fountain of the Spirits; which being done, the invigorated Spirits can pre&s;erve that order which is agreeable to the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of the whole Body, and the particular Parts. And therefore when the <HI>Ataxy</HI> of the Spirits has vitiated the Hu|mours by long continuance, you mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> the Humours &s;o corrupted, by <HI>bleeding</HI> and <HI>Purging</HI> if the Patient has &s;ufficient strength, before you endeavour to invigo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ate the Blood; and which indeed you can
<PB N="48" REF="47">&s;carce do, whil&s;t a <HI>faeculent</HI> heap of Humours lye in the way.</P>
<P>If there be room for a <HI>Vomit,</HI> you mu&s;t always begin with that, e&s;pecially in <HI>Caco|ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mical</HI> Per&s;ons in whom a mighty load of <HI>Vi&s;cous</HI> Phlegm &s;ticking to the Folds and Coats of the Stomach, hinders the Vertues of other Medicines. In a few Days after the Vomit, unle&s;s &s;omewhat indicates the contrary; in Women of a <HI>Hot</HI> Tempera|ment open a Vein in the Arm pre&s;ently, or afterward if need be take Blood from the Foot, or the Fundament by <HI>Leeches,</HI> and after the&s;e Evacuations duly performed: <HI>always provided they be indicated,</HI> let a Purge be given three or four Mornings after.
