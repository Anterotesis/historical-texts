<P>The Attempt may perhaps be allowed &s;ome Prai&s;e, becau&s;e &s;uch a Book is wanted: Parents generally take the Care of Di&s;tem|per upon them&s;elves; and you very will know low fataly they are deceived when they believe it attended with little Danger. You

<HEAD>THE PARENT's GUIDE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MEASLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Occa&s;ion of this Treati&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>_THE misfortune of an honour|able family who lo&s;t an only child by this di&s;ea&s;e; perhaps from its unconquerable vio|lence, but as I rather apprehend from a wrong management, has directed my at|tention to its nature, and the proper treat|ment.
<PB N="2" REF="5">Being removed from the intere&s;ts of the profe&s;&s;ion, I may perhaps be thought a fit per&s;on to write upon the &s;ubject u&s;efully: and I &s;hall be happy if by a fair detail of the circum&s;tances, and the danger, and plain directions for avoid|ing it, I may be in&s;trumental to the &s;av|ing &s;ome at lea&s;t of tho&s;e lives which are lo&s;t continually by the con&s;equences of the Mea&s;les, when the di&s;ea&s;e has been thought long over; and tho&s;e who grieve for them, wonder of what they died.</P>
<P>WHAT I &s;hall attempt is to lay the ne|ce&s;&s;ary information before the parents or relations of the di&s;ea&s;ed. It may be u&s;e|ful al&s;o to our apothecaries: whither or no the younger phy&s;icians want in&s;truction, in this ca&s;e, it may not become me to judge: I hope tho&s;e who do want it will not be above receiving it. But there is a more e&s;&s;ential rea&s;on why the needful ad|vice &s;hould be directed to the parent: this is a di&s;ea&s;e in which medicines can do very little; and wherein all good is to be expected from a careful management.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>IT cannot be deny'd that the lo&s;t child to who&s;e dear memory this work is con&s;ecrated, had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of re&s;pect|able phy&s;icians; nor could it be over|looked, that while he peri&s;hed under the&s;e &s;killful hands, the unattended children of the next damp cellar, got through the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e with perfect &s;afety.</P>
<P>LET it not be inferred from this, that medicines are hurtful, or that care is dangerous: facts &s;hould be under&s;tood be|fore we rea&s;on from them; and the great rule of life is moderation. Some medi|cines may be u&s;eful, but we &s;hould know, not only what the&s;e are, but when they are to be given; and tho' ill ap|plyed attendance may be de&s;tructive; yet there is no di&s;ea&s;e where a continual and judicious care is more required.</P>
<P>To apply the&s;e medicines; and to di|rect this care, is the de&s;ign of the pre|&s;ent treati&s;e, the &s;ole purpo&s;e of which is to be of &s;ervice to mankind: the God of mercy grant it may be u&s;eful.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e called the Mea&s;les is an inflammatory fever of a pecu|liar kind; attended with an eruption over the whole &s;urface of the body; not ga|thering into pimples, or producing matter as the &s;mall pox, but only ri&s;ing to a &s;mall heighth above the level of the &s;kin; with heat, and a high red colour.</P>
<P>THESE eruptions are not con&s;ined to the &s;urface of the body: they attack al&s;o the internal parts; and particularly the lungs.</P>
<P>THEY u&s;ually remain upon the child about four days; &s;ometimes a little longer, &s;ometimes le&s;s: and at the end of that time, dying away, the &s;kin &s;eems covered with a &s;kurff like bran. The fever goes off at the &s;ame period; and what we di&s;|tinctly call the Mea&s;les is thus at an end: but there are con&s;equences yet behind very dangerous when they are not expected.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e is communicated by infec|tion; and mo&s;t per&s;ons have it once in their lives: but it never attacks any one a &s;econd time. 'Tis thought to be origin|nally native of Africa and to have been carried thence into Aegypt, and from Ae|gypt into our part of the world: but, however that be, it appears frequently in parts of England, where there is no cau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to think it is brought by infection; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> can all the care of parents prevent their children from having the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>INDEED it would not be their intere&s;t to do this, if they could: for tho&s;e who e&s;cape it in their infancy have it at a more advanced period of their lives; and it is then much more dangerous.</P>
<P>THE Mea&s;les may break out at any &s;ea&s;on of the year; but Spring and Au|tumn are the mo&s;t u&s;ual times; and when the di&s;ea&s;e once appears in a place it &s;oon &s;preads: not only becau&s;e it is catching, but becau&s;e the &s;ame &s;tate of the air,
<PB N="6" REF="9">which cau&s;ed it fir&s;t to break out upon one per&s;on, has the like effect on more.</P>
<P>OF the two natural &s;ea&s;ons for the Mea&s;les the Autumn generally produces the wor&s;t kind. An open Spring after a mild winter frequently makes the di&s;ea&s;e allmo&s;t univer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">al; but it is at no part of the year attended with &s;o little danger.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of infancy is the mo&s;t na|tural to this di&s;temper; and the time of life at which it generally goes off be&s;t, is from three to four years old. In general infants earlier than this, do not throw out the eruptions &s;o freely; and, when children are at an age to eat &s;tronger food, the inflammation is apt to be greater and the &s;tate of the lungs more dangerous. In tender infants the great care is required to manage the time of the eruption; in chil|dren more advanced it is the con&s;equences we are to regard mo&s;t. Nature will ge|nerally take care of the eruption; but if great attention be not &s;hewn, afterwards hectic fevers and con&s;umptions follow.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<P>The Mea&s;les are always attended with &s;ome danger to grown per&s;ons; and there are &s;ea&s;ons which make them terrible to all ages: in the Autumn of the year 1672, the Mea&s;les raged in &s;o univer&s;al and ter|rible a degree in London that they &s;wept off the children like a plague: the Spring of the &s;ucceeding year &s;hew'd the di&s;ea&s;e almo&s;t as univer&s;ally in the country, but le&s;s dangerous. In the year 1701, there was &s;uch an other &s;evere vi&s;itation; but fewer died; for a better method of treat|ment had been introduced, and particu|larly the free u&s;e of bleeding. <HI>Sydenham</HI> the oracle of phy&s;icians for many years, had not fallen upon this happy expe|dient; and <HI>Moreton</HI> who wrote with reputation on this di&s;ea&s;e, tho' his practice in it was not altogether &s;ucce&s;sful, did not allow this help but in the fir&s;t &s;tage. The free u&s;e of bleeding at any period of the Mea&s;les when the &s;ymptoms called for it, was the di&s;covery that took off the fatatality of the di&s;ea&s;e; and this we owe to Dr. <HI>Mead.</HI> In general tho&s;e who have the Mea&s;les in a
<PB N="8" REF="11">good air, get better over them than &s;uch as have them in London, and tho&s;e chil|dren naturally are in mo&s;t danger, which are of the fulle&s;t and gro&s;&s;e&s;t habits.</P>
<P>THE purpo&s;e of this treati&s;e is utility; therefore it will be proper to add, as the re&s;ult of the foregoing con&s;iderations that tho&s;e parents may think them&s;elves mo&s;t happy, who&s;e children take this di&s;ea&s;e in the country, in a mild Spring, when a fa|vourable kind is about; when the age is from two year and a half to four and a half, and the child otherwi&s;e healthy and not gro&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN we know what is to be wi&s;h'd, the next &s;tep is to endeavour to obtain it; and as this di&s;ea&s;e will probably come on at &s;ome time of life, and may be dangerous, I think a parent may wi&s;ely go &s;o far toward inoculation in this ca&s;e, as to take his child into the chamber where &s;ome one of a like age and habit has a fa|vable kind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The &s;ymptoms of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER nature, or the prac|tice ju&s;t recommended to the pa|rent has brought on the Mea&s;les, we are next to con&s;ider how it &s;hould be treated; but to this end we mu&s;t fir&s; know the di&s;ea&s;e, and directly under&s;tand its &s;ymp|toms. This is the more needful to tho&s;e who have not taken their child into the way of infection, becau&s;e a certain care is nece&s;&s;ary from the fir&s;t; and the attack cannot be known &s;o early unle&s;s this be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It will be u&s;eful to con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;e in three &s;tages; for the &s;ymptoms, the dan|ger, and the nece&s;&s;ary care differ accord|ing to the&s;e three periods. We may call them: 1. <HI>The attack.</HI> 2. <HI>The time of the eruption.</HI> 3. <HI>The decline of the di&s;ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect;. 1. <HI>The &s;ymptoms of the attack.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t attack of the Mea&s;les u&s;u|ally comes on at the time of the child's
<PB N="10" REF="13">waking in the morning; and this is more or le&s;s perceived as the a&s;&s;ault is milder or more violent. The child is cro&s;s peevi&s;h and unwilling to get up; re&s;tle&s;s; full of unea&s;y motion; and to&s;&s;ing his head about: and &s;oon after this he begins to cough and &s;neeze.</P>
<P>WHEN taken up and dre&s;&s;ed he com|plains of his head, the cough grows wor&s;e, his eye-lids &s;well and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">k red, and his no&s;e runs: he is hot and cold by turns; and his eyes water.</P>
<P>AFTER a few hours more he grows drow&s;y; cannot hold up his head, lies down, cries, and the coughing and &s;neez|ing grow more violent. He will then not be ea&s;y 'till put to bed; and that is the be&s;t place for him. From this time he be|comes more drow&s;y, but the cough inter|rupts his &s;lumbers: and thus pa&s;&s;es the fir&s;t day.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd day his fle&s;h is hotter; his eye-lids are more &s;well'd and enflam'd, and the tongue is furr'd, but moi&s;t; the eyes
<PB N="11" REF="14">and no&s;e run more; the breathing grows difficult; and a &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach comes on, with a total lo&s;s of appetite, and a continual thir&s;t. The &s;ickne&s;s in|crea&s;ing the child generally vomits. Some|times this &s;ymptom comes on at the very fir&s;t attack; &s;ometimes it does not hap|pen at all; this, and other like variations depending on the degree of the di&s;ea&s;e, and condition of the body Sometimes a &s;light purging takes the place of the vo|miting; and thus clo&s;es the fir&s;t period of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect;. <HI>2.</HI> The &s;ymptoms of the Eruption.</HEAD>
<P>THE eruption of the Mea&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s natu|rally follows the &s;tate ju&s;t de&s;cribed: the fever encrea&s;es, and the &s;ymptoms of the attack grow &s;tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ger 'till the eruption ap|pears upon the &s;kin; particularly the breath u&s;ually grows more difficult. The fir&s;t appearance of the eruption is in &s;mall di&s;|tinct red &s;pots: they &s;oon encrea&s;e in number and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">igne&s;s, joining together, and forming irregular great blotches of an in|flam'd
<PB N="12" REF="15">colour; which over-&s;pread the brea&s;t and face, and afterwards the whole body. The&s;e ri&s;e a little above the &s;kin, as is ea&s;ily percieved by drawing the hand gently over them; but they never &s;well up to any heighth.</P>
<P>THE cough becomes le&s;s violent as the&s;e eruptions come out; and the breath grows ea&s;ier; but the &s;welling of the eye-lids and the running at the no&s;e continue. This is the natural cour&s;e of the eruption; and this period continues about three days.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect;. <HI>3.</HI> Of the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Mea&s;les have come to their full &s;tate of the eruption; they pre|&s;ently begin to decay and die away: the &s;kin is then covered with a &s;curff where they were; and the di&s;ea&s;e goes off. This is perceived fir&s;t on the face; and &s;oon after that in all the re&s;t of the Body.</P>
<P>LET not the parent &s;uppo&s;e becau&s;e the eruption is over, his care is at an end;
<PB N="13" REF="16">for this is the time of greate&s;t danger. The cough which had become ea&s;ier while the Mea&s;les were out, now grows more violent; the fever is too apt to en|crea&s;e at the &s;ame time; and the breath to grow more difficult. According to the mildne&s;s or violence of the di&s;ea&s;e the&s;e &s;ymptoms are greater or le&s;s in degree: but 'tis the con&s;tant method that they come out thus; and in common ca&s;es whether of a milder or &s;everer kind, this is the general cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR &s;ymptoms will &s;ometimes ari&s;e in very bad ca&s;es, but of the&s;e we &s;hall treat hereafter in con&s;idering the wor&s;t kind of the di&s;ea&s;e. In the u&s;ual cour&s;e tho&s;e which have been recounted are all that appear; and as we have divided the time of the continuance in the di&s;temper into the&s;e three regular &s;tages, or periods, it will be ea&s;y for the parent to under|&s;tand the treatment proper in each.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The management of a child in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of an att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ck of this di&s;ea&s;e appear, let the child be taken into his bed chamber, and the room be kept warm but not too hot or clo&s;e: as long as he is able to keep up, let him; but when the &s;ymp|toms encrea&s;e put him to bed, and let him lie warm, but not &s;weltered. Let the air of the room be often refre&s;hed by opening the door; but defend the child carefully from the draught that comes in, by clo&s;ing the curtains on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as he is in bed let him be blooded in the arm; or back of the hand. The proper quantity is about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r ounces for a child of four years old: but a little more may be &s;pared in gro&s;s habits, and in very tender ones, le&s;s will an&s;wer the intention.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<P>IF he has had one &s;tool that day it is &s;ufficient; if not, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give him a gly&s;ter. This &s;hould be made of a quarter of a pint of broth of chick|ens guts, with a &s;poonful of oil of &s;weet almonds, a &s;poonful of powder &s;ugar, and four &s;poonfulls of milk.</P>
<P>'TIS common to u&s;e olive oil in gly&s;|ters; but it is wrong: there is &s;alt added to all the olive oils before they are &s;ent over; and this tends to irritate, which is not the intention. On &s;uch little circum|&s;tances as the&s;e the life of a child often depends. In the Mea&s;les the bowels mu&s;t be kept open; but yet we are to fear a violent purging. Such a &s;ymptom often comes on in the natural cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; and none is more dangerous. To &s;top it, is to kill the patient; yet if it con|tinues uncheckd it often takes him off in the end; by remaining upon him when the di&s;ea&s;e is over, and bringing on a fatal decay, attended with an unconquerable hectic fever. This is one of the con&s;e|quences again&s;t which we are to guard,
<PB N="16" REF="19">even in the natural cour&s;e of the Mea&s;les; let us therefore be very careful not to give a tendency that way by carele&s;sne&s;s, or an ill choice of remedies.</P>
<P>THE child will have no appetite for food; nor will it be proper he &s;hould eat any thing. Yet a little nouri&s;hment may be given at times by the u&s;e of barley-water, with milk. The barley-water &s;hould be made of pearl barley; and about one fourth part milk added to it. Twice or three times a day he &s;hould have a little of this warm.</P>
<P>THE cough will be trouble&s;ome now tho' it will in &s;ome degree abate, as the eruption comes out more fully: it may be greatly ea&s;ed at the pre&s;ent period by a pec|toral infu&s;ion, and the &s;ame medicine properly prepared will al&s;o prevent an in|flammation on the lungs, and will an&s;wer at the &s;ame time the needfull purpo&s;e of diluting.</P>
<P>TAKE rai&s;ins &s;ton'd one ounce, liquo|rice root brui&s;ed a quarter of an ounce,
<PB N="17" REF="20">half an ounce of the leaves of white hoar|hound fre&s;h gathered; nitre ten grains, and whole lin&s;eed a &s;poonful: put the&s;e into a clean &s;tone jar, and pour upon them a quart of boiling water: let it &s;tand covered up two hours, then &s;train it off without pre&s;&s;ing; and let the child take half a tea cup full of it ju&s;t warm'd once in three hours.</P>
<P>THE leaves of colts foot or &s;cabious, are more commonly u&s;ed than hoarhound, in pectoral infu&s;ions, but this herb is of a na|ture highly &s;uperior to them; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ame virtue of ea&s;ing a cough that tho&s;e and the other pectoral herbs have, but it has be&s;ide a gentle, yet always prevalent quality of preventing ob&s;tructions in the vi&s;cera, and particularly of the lungs: there always is inflammation where there is ob&s;truction; and wherever there is in|flammation we have al&s;o a right to fear ob&s;truction, this is a great danger in the Mea&s;les; indeed it is the great object of fear, tho' it do not wear a terrible form thus early. This herb in the pectoral in|fu&s;ion will do more than many medicines to prevent it. If the virtues of engli&s;h
<PB N="18" REF="21">herbs were more regarded, the practice of phy&s;ick would be much more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e helps, the time from the fir&s;t attack to the beginning of the erup|tion will pa&s;s without danger. Re&s;tle&s;|ne&s;s and a cough mu&s;t be expected; but the child will have as much ea&s;e as the nature of the ca&s;e will allow, and the parent may be &s;ecure that he is &s;afe.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The management in the &s;econd &s;tage of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the eruption begins to ap|pear, the child mu&s;t be kept a little warmer than before; but &s;till there mu&s;t be a free and pure air in the room. The great ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e will now be to make him keep him&s;elf cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the bed, to the chin; and there is no way of doing this but by con&s;tant attendance: for children cannot be pe&s;uaded; and nothing is wor&s;e than to check the eruption.

<P>GREAT attention mu&s;t now be had to the pul&s;e, and to the condition of the bowells. Some degree of fever there mu&s;t be, and this will rai&s;e the pul&s;e; but if it be too full, as well as too quick, probably then another bleeding will be required. 'Tis natural to fear this would check the eruption; the phy&s;icians of the la&s;t age thought &s;o; and from their practice and writings that opinion became univer&s;al: but it is an error. When there is this in|dication in the pul&s;e, when the cough in|encrea&s;es, and the breath grows more dif|ficult, the nece&s;&s;ity of another bleeding is evident; and in&s;tead of the effect of check|ing the eruptions, they will be &s;een to come out the fuller and more freely for it.</P>
<P>THE child &s;hould continue to have one &s;tool in the day: if he have two there is no harm; but if more than this it is wrong in the other extream; aud &s;ome care mu&s;t be taken on that head. If there have
<PB N="20" REF="23">been no &s;tool in the whole day, there mu&s;t be a gly&s;ter given toward evening: this may be the &s;ame as before directed.</P>
<P>WITH regard to checking the too large number of &s;tools, a great deal of caution is required; becau&s;e of the oppo|&s;ite danger: and the fir&s;t attempt mu&s;t be to do it, in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e medicines which are taken for the cough.</P>
<P>AS the child will be now weaker, and le&s;s able to cough up, &s;omething will be nece&s;&s;ary to ea&s;e that &s;ymptom be&s;ide the pectoral infu&s;ion; not that this is to be omitted, for it is a good diluter and has o|ther excellent qualities, but with it mu&s;t be joined &s;omething farther. A great ea&s;e and relief may be had at this period by an oily linctus; and nearly equal good by a mucilaginous one with gum tragacanth. One or other of the&s;e will be nece&s;&s;ary and the condition of the bowells will give the direction which &s;hould be u&s;ed; for the oil will tend to open them; and the
<PB N="21" REF="24">mucilaginous one is in &s;ome degree of a contrary quality.</P>
<P>THEREFORE if the child have not one &s;tool a day during the time of the erup|tion, let the following linctus be us'd.</P>
<P>RUB in a marble mortar a quarter of an ounce of loaf &s;ugar to powder, put to this four &s;poonfulls of oil of &s;weet almonds and four &s;poonfulls of &s;yrup of mar&s;hmal|lows, mix them well together, and put this in a cup. Brui&s;e the end of a piece of clean liquorice root 'till it is &s;haggy like a bru&s;h, and let this be dipt into it, and and &s;tirr'd about: &s;ome of the linctus will &s;tick to it, which the child will &s;uck off with great plea&s;ure, let him thus take a little of it once in two or three hours, when the cough is mo&s;t trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>ON the other hand if the &s;tools be more than two in a day, in&s;tead of this, make up the following. Take con&s;erve of red ro&s;es one ounce, &s;yrup of quinces an ounce and a half, compound powder of gumm
<PB N="22" REF="25">tragacanth two &s;cruples: mix the&s;e well to|gether, and let this linctus be taken in the &s;ame manner as the other. Either of the&s;e will ea&s;e the cough, and there will be a great advantage in u&s;ing one or the other, according to the habit of the body.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es where the bowells are in a per|fectly good &s;tate, a &s;permaceti emul&s;ion may be given in the place of the&s;e. It will have as much power over the cough, and will no way effect the &s;tools: it is made thus.</P>
<P>RUB to powder in a marble mortar three drachms of &s;permaceti, and the &s;ame quantity of treble refin'd &s;ugar, put to the&s;e the yolk of an egg, and when they are well mixed add half a pint of com|mon water and three quarters of an ounce of bal&s;amick &s;yrup. Let a &s;poonful of this be given every three or four hours, always &s;haking it well together.</P>
<P>IF the body is bound, and the u&s;e of the oily linctus do not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="26">of keeping up at lea&s;t one &s;tool a day, re|cour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the &s;ame gly&s;ter as was before directed, and it mu&s;t be given every evening; for nothing more mu&s;t be done by medicines. But in the other ca&s;e, in a tendency to a purging, if the mucila|ginous linctus does not take effect we may give hartshorn drink, carefully prepared and in a &s;mall quantity: it is to be made thus. Boil an ounce of hartshorn in pow|der in a quart of &s;pring water for ten mi|nutes; then let it &s;tand to &s;ettle, &s;train it off and add half an ounce of the fine&s;t &s;u|gar. Let the child take two &s;poonfulls of this, ju&s;t warm'd, once in three hours: this with the effect of the mucilaginous linctus, will probably check the di&s;order of the bowels.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t continue taking the pectoral infu&s;ion; and if the&s;e medicines do not &s;urfficiently an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, it will be proper to add half a drachm of the gum tragacanth whole, to the other in|gredients, the next time that infu&s;ion is
<PB N="24" REF="27">made. This will not entirely di&s;&s;olve; but it will greatly help the medecine.</P>
<P>IF the number of &s;tools has weakened the child, he may have a jelly of harts|horn warm'd, and given him a little at a time to recruit his &s;trength; but in the other ca&s;e of the want of &s;tools, this mu&s;t not be allowed, nor will it be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances and a careful attendance, the eruptions will come out regularly, the face and brea&s;t will be fir&s;t cover'd with them, then the back of the hands and the legs: all the time the child will be kept tolerably ea&s;y; and the pul&s;e no more rai&s;ed than is nece&s;&s;ary to the good cour&s;e of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>IF at any time the eruptions &s;eem to deaden before it has come to the heighth a little more warmth in the room, and a free u&s;e of the pectoral infu&s;ion warm'd, will bring them out again fre&s;h and full.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="28">
<P>NO heating me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">icines under the name of cordials, or with the mi&s;t ken intention of keeping them out, mu&s;t be allowed: they will not be nece&s;&s;ary; and they will certainly do hurt in the end. This cau|tion is needful in all families, becau&s;e the error is common. Apothecaries are apt to throw in hot medicines under the notion of &s;weats, and the good women are fond of &s;affron: both are wrong; they encrea&s;e the fever, and the tendency to inflamma|tion, which is the great thing we have to fear: they always make the breathing dif|ficult; and u&s;ually encrea&s;e the cough.</P>
<P>THE great danger is the di&s;temper falling upon the lungs in its decline, and the&s;e he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ting medicines give an early tendency to that mi&s;chief. If the child be kept from to&s;&s;ing o&s;&s; the cloaths, tho&s;e warm dilut|ing things we have ordered, will keep the &s;kin moi&s;t; which is all that need be wi&s;h'd: and the air of the room may be kept warm enough for this, without &s;tif|fling the infant by &s;hutting up all the doors and windows, which making the breath|ing
<PB N="26" REF="29">difficult, will encrea&s;e both the cough and inflammation.</P>
<P>THE eyes will run, and the eyelids will &s;well and look red in this &s;tate of the di&s;|ea&s;e it is to be expected: and it will give the child unea&s;ine&s;s whatever we can do: but this will be le&s;s, as the management is more careful in other re&s;pects; and it may be relieved by frequent wa&s;hing the eye|lids with a mixture, of two parts skim'd milk and one part ro&s;e water, made ju&s;t warm. Thus he will be &s;afely con|ducted thro' the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this cour&s;e there is very little medi|cine needed, unle&s;s in a tendency to &s;ome bad &s;ymptom; and what are here directed in tho&s;e ca&s;es are perfectly innocent; yet they will be found &s;ufficient. A great deal of care is indeed directed; but why &s;houd that be refu&s;ed? the di&s;ea&s;e is but of &s;hort continuance; and a neglect of this atten|dance during tho&s;e few days may entail certain mi&s;ery, or death upon the infant.
<PB N="27" REF="30">We are not to &s;uppo&s;e the children of the poor e&s;cape always, becau&s;e we &s;ee them get &s;afely, as we think, thro' the di&s;temper.

<P>CARE and a continual good manage|ment thro' this &s;tage of the di&s;temper is the great &s;ecurity; and let the parent &s;ee this care is taken.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the management of the child in the third &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE third &s;tage of the Mea&s;les which we call the decline, takes in the time from the compleat fullne&s;s of the eruption, till its going off from the whole body: This is u&s;ually the &s;pace of two days. The eruptions upon the face and brea&s;t keep out till tho&s;e upon the legs are fully rai&s;ed; when they are per|fect, the whole body is cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">red with the Mea&s;les; and they begin immediately after to die away.</P>
<P>LET this period be attentively watched, for it requires care: as the eruption goes off, other &s;ymptoms often come on, e&s;pe|cially when the di&s;ea&s;e has been carele&s;ly or ignorantly treated; and the&s;e are more dangerous than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ign of the decay of erup|tions, or the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, is a
<PB N="29" REF="32">whiti&s;h roughne&s;s on the chin and upper lip; then the eruptions upon the cheeks become rough and tade away; and tho&s;e of the body, legs, and arms, go off next in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>OBSERVE whether the eyelids continue enflamed after the eruption on the face goe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> off: if they do, it &s;hews a nece&s;&s;ity of immediate bleeding.</P>
<P>THE cough naturally encrea&s;es as the eruption goes away; e&s;pecially when care has been wanting in the cour&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e; and this is another certain indica|tion for immediate bleeding.</P>
<P>IF the breathing grow difficult, it is al|&s;o an equal notice of the want of that a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e &s;ymptoms declare the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of doing it when the eruptions are dying off: it is always proper to be done after they are all gone: all the dif|ference is that in this ca&s;e it mu&s;t be done one day &s;ooner.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="33">
<P>WHEN children have been in a good &s;tate of body, at the time of the attack, and the di&s;ea&s;e has been conducted with|out neglect or error, during the two pre|ceding &s;tages; the eruption goes off with|out any aggravation of the other &s;ymptoms, and the cough will by degrees grow mil|der. This is a &s;tate that &s;hould make the parent very happy: but let it not lull him into a fal&s;e &s;ecurity. Still let the child be blooded: it will never do harm: and it is always nece&s;&s;ary; though the nece&s;&s;ity be not equally &s;een. The &s;mall remains of the cough will be taken off by one bleed|ing: which otherwi&s;e would have hung upon the child, and would have encrea&s;|ed with the fir&s;t cold, and entailed great danger.</P>
<P>DURING the two days of the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ame attention mu&s;t be had to the &s;tate of the body as throughout the re&s;t of the illne&s;s. For 'tis an inflamma|tion that we principally fear; and a co&s;tive habit will greatly tend to bring it on. The
<PB N="31" REF="34">contrary danger of a purging &s;ucceeding the Mea&s;les, is now al&s;o to be guarded again&s;t with equal care: if the con&s;titution &s;hew that tendency.</P>
<P>LET the parent have in mind the&s;e two &s;ources of &s;ucceeding mi&s;chief. He has been told the Mea&s;les are apt to fix in go|ing off, either upon the lungs, or bowels, bringing on in the end a con&s;umption, or a hectic; and let him now take care to a|void the fir&s;t tendency to either of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. This tendency to one or other of them, always appears in the two days now con&s;idered; and great evils are pre|vented by &s;light means, if they are ap|ply'd in their beginnings. Now new me|decine is needed at this period, except the &s;light change of oil for &s;perma ceti, in the linctus; nor any new care: only a choice of the mo&s;t proper among tho&s;e ea&s;y ones we have before mentioned, and a &s;trict contrinuace of the attention.</P>
<P>ONE or two &s;tools mu&s;t be expected each of the&s;e days, and a choice mu&s;t be
<PB N="32" REF="35">made of the medicines directed in the pre|ceding chapter for that purpo&s;e. If the day pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s without a &s;tool, the gly&s;ter mu&s;t be given at night as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>To quiet the remainder of the cough after bleeding, a linctus of &s;perma ceti mu&s;t be given. It will be as plea&s;ant to the palate as either of the others; and as the ta&s;te is &s;oon pall'd with oily medicines, this will be got down e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ier becau&s;e of the variety. It is to be made thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">. Rub to powder in a marble mortar a quarter of an ounce of &s;perma ceti, put to this the yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">k of a new laid egg, mix them well, then add one &s;poonful of oil of &s;weet al|monds, and two &s;poonfulls of &s;yrup of bal&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m. Let the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ld take a tea&s;poonful of this when ever the cough is trouble|&s;ome. This is the general medecine to be given in the decline of the Mea&s;les; but in ca&s;e of a purging coming on, it mu&s;t not be allowed; but recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the mucilaginous linctus directed in the preceding chapter.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="36">
<P>IF the eyes continue &s;ore, the &s;ame mix|ture of milk and ro&s;e water warm mu&s;t be u&s;ed frequently, to wa&s;h them, and the child mu&s;t not be placed &s;o as to face a &s;trong light. If they are &s;o bad as to be very painful, a piece of green &s;ilk &s;hou'd be contrived to fall over them: and this with frequent gentle wa&s;hing, will keep them ea&s;y 'till the next &s;tage; the nece&s;&s;ary management of which will carry off the inflammation entirely.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the mouth is very &s;ore at this period of the Mea&s;les, and in this ca&s;e a plea&s;ant gargle mu&s;t be made up of &s;y|rup of mulberries and &s;pring water, two &s;poonfuls of the &s;yrup to a quarter of a pint of the water will be &s;ufficient: the be&s;t way of u&s;ing it is with a &s;mall &s;y|ringe; but if the little patient can be taught to gargle his mouth him&s;elf and &s;pit it out again, nothing can do better.</P>
<P>IF the child has not had the thru&s;h be|fore; it will be apt to come on after the
<PB N="34" REF="37">Mea&s;les, e&s;pecially if they have been vio|lent. This fir&s;t appears in a &s;orene&s;s of the mouth, and the parent will know it by the round form of the &s;mall &s;ores with their white edges. In this ca&s;e a violent purging u&s;ually follows: therefore the great caution mu&s;t be in the choice of tho&s;e medecines directed before, to prevent it. A&s;tringents, or the common medi|cines for &s;toping a loo&s;ene&s;s, would in this be in the highe&s;t degree dangerous: bleed|ing has been declared nece&s;&s;ary, in this &s;tage of the di&s;order; and the &s;ooner it is done upon &s;uch an appearance the better. It will go farther toward &s;toping the purg|ing than any medecine what&s;oever; and will make tho&s;e &s;afe and gentle ones be|fore directed take their effect.</P>
<P>IT will be proper that for the&s;e two days of the decline of the di&s;order, the room be kept &s;omewhat cooler than be|fore; the purer the air is, the le&s;s labour have the lungs in breathing, and any ob|&s;truction will be apt to create inflamma|tion,
<PB N="35" REF="38">in a ca&s;e where nature has too much tendency that way.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t of the&s;e two days it will be proper to give the child a jelly, warmed, and taken a little at a time: on the &s;econd, his appetite will begin to return and he may be allowed a bread pudding. Let him be taken out of bed at noon, on the latter of the&s;e days; and &s;it up three or four hours: not longer; for this will re|fre&s;h him, but more would fatigue him. Let his drink be only the pectoral infu&s;ion or the hartshorn decoction, according to the condition of his body; and let the ut|mo&s;t care be taken to put him on a warm dre&s;s for the hours he is to be up. Tho' tolerably pure air is nece&s;&s;ary for his breath|ing ea&s;ily, nothing would be &s;o dangerous as catching cold.</P>
<P>When the child is laid in his bed again, on the evening of the &s;econd day of this &s;tage, we may pronounce the Mea&s;les to be over: but there are con&s;equences we have nam'd, which may be very terrible,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the management of a child after the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is always a tendency in the decline of the Mea&s;les to their fal|ling either upon the lungs, or on the bowels. Sometimes this is apparent, and alarming; often it is &s;o &s;light as to pa&s;s unregarded. The danger is more imme|diate, when the attack upon ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">her of the&s;e parts is violent; but perhaps it is more fatal when le&s;s perceived, be|cau&s;e it will be &s;trengthened by neglect. Probably the &s;ymptoms will be &s;light when a child has been treated during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, according to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gular method here l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">id down; but let them not be for that rea&s;on over looked. Let not the parent who has pre&s;erved him. thro' the di&s;temper, grow negligent of him afterwards: this will be wor&s;e than to have neglected him in the begining.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="40">
<P>BLEEDING and purging are always ne|ce&s;&s;ary after the Mea&s;les. If the &s;ymp|toms have required bleeding in the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tage, or in the fir&s;t and third, this purpo&s;e will have been an&s;wered; and only the purging will now remain ne|ce&s;&s;ary under that head: but if the child has not been blooded at all; or only in the fir&s;t &s;tage, it is needful to repeat it after the decline.</P>
<P>LET the quantity taken away be about four ounces. The be&s;t time in this ca&s;e, is the day after the di&s;ea&s;e is over; that is the morning following, the &s;econd day of the decline.</P>
<P>THE day following let him take a gen|tle purge. The mo&s;t proper is rhubarb, becau&s;e we are &s;till to have a regard to the danger of a lo&s;ene&s;s coming on: it will be proper to guard al&s;o again&s;t tho&s;e &s;harp humours, which often fall upon the &s;to|mach and bowels after this di&s;ea&s;e. Therefore let the purge be the following powder. Take powder of rhubarb ten
<PB N="38" REF="41">grains, prepared oi&s;ter &s;hells fix grains, mix this in a little barley water and give it in the morning.</P>
<P>THE do&s;e here directed, is what in ge|neral will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for a child of the age, at which we have &s;uppo&s;ed the Mea&s;les to have come on; but in this re&s;pect there is no rule, but the particular con&s;titution of every one. The quantity of rhubarb mu&s;t be encrea&s;ed if this is not found &s;ufficient; or dimini&s;hed if this prove more powerful than intended: but 'tis likely to err in this do&s;e on the &s;afe &s;ide; for it is le&s;s rather than more, than will u&s;ually be needed. The intent is, that it &s;hould give about four &s;tools; and in&s;tead of barley water, the child &s;hould be allowed with this &s;ome very weak thin and clear mutton broth. This purge mu&s;t be repeated every other, or every third day, according to the infants &s;trength, 'till he has taken three do&s;es.</P>
<P>WHETHER any thing more than this will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, is not ea&s;y
<PB N="39" REF="42">to &s;ay: probably in the milder ca&s;es there will not; but where any &s;ymptoms of a di&s;order of the lungs; when the cough re|mains; or the breathing is difficult, or when weakne&s;s, wa&s;ting of fle&s;h, want of appetite, and a lurking fever follow; the country air and a&s;&s;es milk will be re|quired. In all ca&s;es where the parents circum&s;tances will permit the expence, the&s;e &s;hould be u&s;ed; the &s;eeds of future mi&s;chief often lie deep conceal'd, after this di&s;ea&s;e, and they will be as certain in that ca&s;e to de&s;troy the child at a di&s;tance of time afterwards, as the di&s;orders, brought on immediately with more violent &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the be&s;t cour&s;e is after he has taken two of the three do&s;es of phy&s;ick, to remove him into the coun|try; chu&s;ing a dry &s;ituation and mild clear air.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;o much caution the means u&s;ed to pre&s;erve him, might be to them|&s;elves de&s;tructive; a damp hou&s;e in the
<PB N="40" REF="43">country will give colds as well as in Lon|don; and the &s;harp thin bleak air, of hilly and expo&s;ed places, will be too piercing for &s;uch a child: it will probably throw him into that hectic, which all the care was taken to avoid.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t &s;ituation is on ari&s;ing ground; but not an ab&s;olute hill; defended from the north and north ea&s;t; open to the fouth; and where there is not a great deal of timber growing, nor much &s;tanding water.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a place let the child recruit his &s;trength, and get over the la&s;t remains of the di&s;ea&s;e, by a regular diet and due ex|erci&s;e. With re&s;pect to food, he mu&s;t be very &s;lowly brought to butcher's meat: puddings and a little boiled chicken, &s;hou'd be all, for the fir&s;t eight or ten days: then by degrees broth, carefully made; and af|terwards a little at a time, veal or lamb: nothing &s;tronger mu&s;t be allowed while he is under the cour&s;e of this regimen.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="44">
<P>EVERY morning three quarters of an hour before he gets up, give him a quar|ter of a pint of a&s;&s;es milk; and the &s;ame quantity in the afternoon.</P>
<P>IF the a&s;&s;es milk turns &s;our upon his &s;tomach, a little prepared oi&s;ter &s;hell mu&s;t be given with it, for the fir&s;t two or three days: and if it has a tendency to run thro' him, and the &s;ame powder does not prevent it &s;ufficiently, a little &s;ugar of ro&s;es or the con&s;erve, mu&s;t be mix'd with it, 'till that &s;ymptom is over. If the cough continues, which is not likely with this regimen, he may take the &s;perma ce|ti emul&s;ion as he did during the illne&s;s.</P>
<P>EXERCISE, and the free enjoyment of the &s;weet air of the country, are e&s;&s;en|tial parts of this method; but the eye of the parent ought to be al&s;o there: other|wi&s;e much mi&s;chief may follow. A change of air takes the immediate effect of giving any per&s;on &s;pirits, and children feel this more &s;trongly than grown people: therefore if the little patient be not pre|vented,

<P>HE mu&s;t not be permitted to go out in the morning before the air is warm, and the ground thoroughly dry; nor to remain out 'till the cool and damp of the evening. The middle hours of the day are the whole&s;ome ones; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of gentle exerci&s;e and the free air of that pe|riod, he will pre&s;ently recover.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant, or the parent him&s;elf &s;hou'd have him by the hand, all the time he is out for the fi&s;t two or three days; for o|therewi&s;e he will naturally run about, or u&s;e too much motion. The lungs are tender after this di&s;ea&s;e; and violent ex|erci&s;e quickens the breath, and puts them into a kind of convul&s;ion.

<P>FOR tho&s;e who cannot give their chil|dren the country air, a&s;&s;es milk &s;hould be very regularly given; and all the other cautions here directed, us'd exactly. After this the child may be determined to be perfectly cured; and to have e&s;caped that danger from this di&s;ea&s;e, which takes off thou&s;ands un&s;een, for one who falls by it openly, and without the knowledge of his relations, that 'tis the Mea&s;les which de|&s;troy him.</P>
<P>THUS we may clo&s;e the account of this di&s;ea&s;e as it u&s;ually appears: but particu|lar ca&s;es afford peculiar circum&s;tances, and from tho&s;e ari&s;e uncommon &s;ymptoms.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of a bad kind of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is that &s;tate of the di&s;temper when it rages with great violence, and is attended with more than u&s;ual dan|ger. 'Tis &s;ometimes general, the bad conditi|on of the air occa&s;ioning it; &s;ometimes it is occa&s;ioned by the particular &s;tate of the child We mu&s;t attend the infant in this ca&s;e with redoubled care; and watch the ri&s;ing mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>CONVULSIONS are alarming &s;ymptoms in the Mea&s;les: they appear in the latter end of the fir&s;t &s;tage; when the eruptions &s;hou'd be coming out. Let the parent fre|quently &s;ee his child at this time; &s;leeping as well as waking; and regard all his little mot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ons. Much to&s;&s;ing about &s;hews a &s;truggle of nature, and pre&s;ages the di&s;|temper will be violent; and if there are twitchings&punc; and ab&s;olute convul&s;ions he mu&s;t be prepared for wor&s;e &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>IF the convul&s;ions are violent, the e|ruption will not come out kindly 'till they
<PB N="45" REF="48">are allayed. At their fir&s;t appearance let proper medicines be given again&s;t them, and of the&s;e Tincture of Ca&s;tor is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>MIX together rue water five ounces, &s;yrup of piony flowers &s;ix drachms, and tincture of ca&s;tor a drachm and a half, &s;hake them up, and give too &s;poonfuls once in three hours; if the convul&s;ed mo|tions do not abate upon this, the addition of a little prepared oi&s;ter &s;hells will pro|bably give it full effect. The mixture &s;hou'd be made a fre&s;h: and it will be a k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of pearl julep. To five ounces of rue water, add a quarter of an ounce of the fine&s;t &s;ugar, and half a drachm of pre|pared oi&s;ter &s;hell with the &s;ame quantity of tincture of ca&s;tor. Let it be taken as the other. All the time let the child be kept warm, and give him frequently &s;ome of the pectoral infu&s;ion. Probably the con|vul&s;ions will go off after two or three do&s;es, if he continues in a gentle &s;tate of per&s;piration; and the eruptions will then come out in their proper manner.</P>
<P>A violent purging &s;ometimes rages, from the very beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e; and encrea&s;es hourly, &s;o as to threaten death. This is a nice point to conduct: the means before directed have been natu|rally
<PB N="46" REF="49">us'd, tho' without &s;ucce&s;s; and ab&s;o|lute a&s;tringents would be immediate death: the cour&s;e of the di&s;order al&s;o threatens de|&s;truction, as certain though not &s;o &s;udden. The following decoction is perfectly &s;afe; and yet with due management will prove effectual.</P>
<P>SLICE one ounce of fre&s;h comfry roof, put it into three pints of &s;pring water, add half a drachm of gumm tragacanth whole, half an ounce of burnt hart&s;horn; and a quarter of an ounce of prepared oi&s;|ter &s;hells: let this boil five or &s;ix minutes, then &s;train it off while hot, thro' a flan|nel bag: &s;et it to &s;ettle, and to the clear liquor, add half an ounce of &s;ugar of ro&s;es. It mu&s;t be given warm two &s;poonfuls after every &s;tool.</P>
<P>IF this does not check the purging, bleeding at the arm mu&s;t be repeated; and the child mu&s;t be kept continually in a &s;tate of gentle per&s;piration. The medicine being then continued will &s;eldom fail to take effect: then let the do&s;e following be le&s;&s;ened, and the u&s;e of it left off by de|grees. The intent is, to reduce the bowels to a &s;tate of affording two &s;tools a day, and not more; and when this decoc|tion once takes effect, it will be ea&s;y to bring them to that condition by its regu|lated u&s;e.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="50">
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;o regular, but that the bad &s;ymptoms of one &s;tage, may be &s;hew them&s;elves in another. Convul&s;ions may come on during the time of the erup|tion; and &s;o may the purging. The &s;ame means are to be u&s;ed, as have been di|rected already: but there is a &s;ymptom in a manner peculiar to the &s;econd &s;tage, and more alarming than any, this a diffi|culty of &s;wallowing and of fetching breath. Children mo&s;t liable to this, are tho&s;e of gro&s;s habits, and &s;uch as have been co&s;tive during the fir&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>THEREFORE if the child be of a gro&s;s body, let five ounces of blood be taken away in&s;tead of four, at the time of the attack; and after this, if a high full pul&s;e, a great quantity and high &s;welling of the eruptions, and a fiery a&s;pect of the face appear tegether, let the bleeding be re|peated on the &s;econd day of the eruption, but in a &s;omewhat &s;maller quantity. The Mea&s;les will come out the more kindly, and it will prevent that &s;uffocation which may el&s;e be expected toward their height. Two gly&s;ters &s;hould be given in the four and twenty hours, if nature does nothing that way her&s;elf; and a plentiful u&s;e of the pectoral infu&s;ion mu&s;t keep the child con&s;tantly in a &s;tate of gentle per&s;piration.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="51">
<P>IF notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, the breath grows more difficult, the face &s;wells, and the eyelids look thick and red, this &s;ymptom is certainly to be expected tow|ard the heighth: and it will be nece&s;&s;ary to bleed again. There is no other alter|native but that or death.</P>
<P>LET no one fear the&s;e bleedings: nature &s;hews that &s;he requires them; and the re|lief they give is like a miracle; for 'tis im|mediate, and certain. Tho&s;e who have op|po&s;ed the bleedings have often been convinced by this, and it would be happy if their ex|ample could al&s;o convince others.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e more than the u&s;ual quantity of blood often is nece&s;&s;ary to be taken away; five or &s;ix ounces however will at any time be &s;ufficient: the &s;trength of the child, and violence of the &s;ymptoms mu&s;t direct; for there can be no general rule for the quantity; tho' the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it, is without ex|ception.</P>
<P>WHEN this frightful &s;ymptom is once t ken away, it rarely returns. However, all pre|cautions &s;hould be u&s;ed again&s;t &s;uch an acci|dent. The bowels mu&s;t be kept open; and the pectoral infu&s;ion drank very plentifully and the child mu&s;t be kept mo&s;t carefully from taking cold. If it &s;hould return, there
<PB N="49" REF="52">will be no po&s;&s;ible relief but by the repetition once more of the bleeding. This is far from a de&s;ireable thing, therefore let all po&s;&s;ible caution be u&s;ed to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>AN inflammation of the eyes, as well as eyelids, &s;ometimes appears at the height of the Mea&s;les, and becomes not only very painful but dangerous. The &s;ame &s;tate of the blood which in one child occa&s;ions the la&s;t nam'd &s;ymptoms, will in another bring on this; and therefore the relief mu&s;t be the &s;ame. Bleeding is the certain remedy.</P>
<P>BY the frequent mention here made of bleeding, let not the parent &s;uppo&s;e it is or|dered to be &s;o very often repeated in any one ca&s;e. Tho&s;e who ca&s;t a &s;light eye over the&s;e pages may be led to make this mi&s;take, for being the great relief in almo&s;t all the bad &s;ymptoms, it cannot but have been nam'd under each of the&s;e heads. As to the quantity directed to be taken away, that is moderate; and in very mild kinds, once bleeding is &s;ufficient; for being done in time it prevents tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which wou'd o|therwi&s;e make it nece&s;&s;ary afterwards: in ca&s;es &s;omewhat wor&s;e, twice will be &s;ufficient; this takes away but eight ounces of blood, which a child may &s;pare without hurt, in an inflammatory di&s;order. In the wor&s;t &s;ymp|toms, a third bleeding may be needful: this is very rarely the ca&s;e, and I have never &s;een a nece&s;&s;ity for more. To &s;peak with free|dom,
<PB N="50" REF="53">I never &s;aw an in&s;tance wheren three bleedings were nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ry from the ab&s;olute violence of the di&s;ea&s;e; tho' &s;ometimes from ill management.</P>
<P>LET not the parent trifle in this ca&s;e. All he can do is to put off an operation, which is better done &s;oon; for the &s;ame &s;tate of the blood which inflames the eyes, at this pe|riod, will take a like effect upon the lungs in the decline.</P>
<P>THE fever which preceeded and accom|panied the eruptions &s;hould go off when they die away, but &s;ometimes it continues after|wards; and becomes of the hectic kind; and then without extreme care the child will be lo&s;t. This generally happens when the infant has been unhealthy before, or when the bowels have continued co&s;tive during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and bleeding has been omitted. A dry cough and a difficulty of breathing u&s;ually attend this fever. Bleeding is again the fir&s;t requi&s;ite; and after this pec|toral and bal&s;amick medicines; and the country air. The &s;perma ceti emul&s;ion, and the pectoral infu&s;ion mu&s;t be continued. The purges &s;hould be repeated as the &s;trength will allow; and then a&s;&s;es milk will compleat the cure.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the u&s;e of Opiates in the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>PHYSICIANS are free with Opiates in the Mea&s;les: and it may appear &s;in|gular that in the method of treating the di&s;|ea&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">id down they have been no where
<PB N="51" REF="54">nam'd: but in what I have &s;een of the di&s;|ea&s;e they have not been wanted; and there is rea&s;on to think they may be hurtful. I have u&s;ualy found this method, prevent tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which opiates are given by others to mitigate; and there are &s;ome bad ones which tho&s;e medicines may bring on. <HI>Sy|denham</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed opiates nece&s;&s;ary; but 'tis to later phy&s;icians we owe the true manage|ment of this di&s;ea&s;e. Among the&s;e Doctor <HI>Mead,</HI> the ornament, not of his profe&s;&s;ion alone, but of his country, de&s;erves the fir&s;t prai&s;e. If opiates ever can be needful, it mu&s;t be in the latter end of the di&s;ea&s;e; but even then 'tis be&s;t to do without them, if po&s;&s;ible. If the cough be violent, and no other me|thod will allay it, a very &s;mall do&s;e of an opiate will have a con&s;iderable effect: and when a purging can be a&s;&s;waged by no other means, a few drops of liquid laudanum will probably a&s;&s;i&s;t the other medicines. In the&s;e extream nece&s;&s;ities, I think opiates will do good; but I am per&s;waded tho&s;e who &s;hall take timely care, very rarely have occa&s;ion to u&s;e them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the care of the Eyes after bad kinds of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>THE eyes and eyelids are always af|fected by the Mea&s;les and in the wor&s;t kinds the &s;orene&s;s continues after the di&s;ea&s;e is over, u&s;ually the la&s;t bleeding brings them
<PB N="52" REF="55">to them&s;elves: or if this fails, they become perfectly well after the fir&s;t do&s;e of phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>WHEN they continue &s;ore after this, the cau&s;e is a natural weakne&s;s: a cold might have brought on the &s;ame di&s;order, therefore it is to be con&s;idered independ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nttly of the Mea|&s;les, and the common remedies are to be us'd. The eyes mu&s;t be defended from the light; and of a long time the child &s;hould not be permitted to walk in the &s;un, or fit facing the windows; and the cure mu&s;t be compleated by wa&s;hing the eyes frequently with the following mixture.</P>
<P>PICK off an ounce of the leaves of com|mon Vervain, pour upon them a quart of boiling water; and let this &s;tand all night: then &s;train off the liquor, and add two &s;poon|fuls of Brandy, warm a little of this and mix with it one third part of &s;kim'd milk. Wa&s;h the eyes with it morning and evening. The virtues of this plant de&s;erve to be more re|garded: great good is done with it by tho&s;e who keep it a &s;ecret; but much more wou'd follow, if it were known univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>I HAVE added this ca&s;e of inflam'd eyes, tho' not a regular con&s;equence of the Mea|&s;les, yet as a complaint which &s;ometimes fol|lows that di&s;ea&s;e; being de&s;irous the parent &s;hou'd find here all needful direction, and the child all &s;afety.</P>
