<P>THE Per&s;on, who Publi&s;hes this &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, and Directions, having Experienc'd, for &s;everal Years la&s;t pa&s;t, in his own Practice, both as a <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> and <HI>Surgeon,</HI> the great, and indeed wonderful Effects of the Me|thods and Medicines, herein laid down and Pre&s;cribed, for the Ea&s;e and Cure of the <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> thought it a Duty in|cumbent upon him, to make the &s;ame known as much as po&s;&s;ible, for the univer&s;al Be|nefit of Mankind; that tho&s;e who un|happily labour under the Severity of the&s;e cruel Di&s;ea&s;es, and have not heard of the Remedies, and may at any Time &s;tand in need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that will be afforded
<PB N="iv" REF="3">by them, may have it in their Power, wherever they may chance to be, (&s;o they have but the Book in their Pockets) of applying them, and that either prepar'd by them&s;elves, or having them prepar'd by an Apothecary.</P>
<P>The whole of what is here Written, is, with &s;ome variations, and &s;mall additions, taken from the Works of no le&s;s a Man, than the late Worthy Sir <HI>Richard Black|more,</HI> Knt. Doctor of Phy&s;ick, and Fellow of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians, in <HI>London,</HI> and in his Time, Phy&s;ician in Ordinary to his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>William,</HI> by &s;aying of which, it is enough without any Encomium of mine, or any ones el&s;e, as to his Learning, con&s;ummate Knowledge, and long Experience, in the Cure of Di&s;|ea&s;es in general, as well as of the&s;e in particular&punc; his Fame therein, as well as his Integrity, Humanity, and compa&s;&s;ionate Regar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his afflicted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pa|tients, being &s;ufficiently known in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<PB N="v" REF="4">
<P>All therefore that I &s;hall &s;ay, is, that every Patient, under the Torture of the&s;e mercile&s;s Di&s;ea&s;es, will not fail (I &s;peak by repeated Experience) to find Relief and a Cure, if they but make timely and di&s;tinct Application of the Remedies, and live up to the ea&s;y Rules and Directions, &s;o plainly and faithfully, without any re&s;erve, herein laid down and explain'd: And as they are Medicines, not pre&s;crib'd at random, or at a venture, but upon the judicious and &s;edate Con&s;ideration of the Author, in a regular Way, grounded upon Rea&s;on and low Experience, and which the Doctor had ever found Succe&s;sful, when he had been call'd to the Relief of Patients in the&s;e deplorable Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they are the more to be regarded, and particu|larly &s;o, as they in every Circum&s;tance, have corre&s;ponded with the Opinions of the be&s;t of Phy&s;icians, and by con&s;equence mu&s;t &s;tand approv'd, by the whole Faculty of Phy&s;ick.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
<P>And tho' the Doctor &s;eems to explode the po&s;&s;ibility of Di&s;&s;olving the <HI>Stone,</HI> yet he has confin'd his Opinion to tho&s;e only of them, that are hard and compact, tho&s;e of them that are porus, light, and friable, he admits may he di&s;&s;olved, or at lea&s;twi&s;e crumbled, or divided into &s;mall Fragments or Parts, &s;o as to be rendred pa&s;&s;able, and has herein al&s;o Pre&s;crib'd &s;uch Remedies, which he has long experienc'd to have done it.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians, I well know, very much differ as to the po&s;&s;ibility of Di&s;&s;olving the <HI>Stone,</HI> many of them affirming it has been done, without any di&s;tinction of hard or &s;oft, and may be daily done, and have re|cited the Ca&s;es of many Patient<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> cured thereby; nor are there wanting as many, who as flatly deny the po&s;&s;ibility thereof: For the fir&s;t, I have now before me, the Works of &s;everal Authors of good Credit, and the Ca&s;es of divers Patients, in con|firmation of their A&s;&s;ertions; and in par|ticular,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">one of the &s;aid Authors, lately fam'd therein, &s;ays, that tho' the Di&s;&s;o|lution of the <HI>Stone,</HI> by Medicines, has been for a long Time exploded as impracti|cable, yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays he, I never could come into that Notion: I always was of Opinion, &s;ays he, that no Di&s;tem|per was Incurable, and that only our Ig|norance of the Cau&s;es, made &s;ome more difficult to handle than others: But that if we could &s;ee into the original Spring of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and &s;tubborn Maladies, we &s;hould find them as tractable, and ea&s;y to Cure, as tho&s;e that lie more obvious to our view: And I per&s;wade my&s;elf, con|tinues he, that if the Po&s;itions I have, ad|vanced, in defence of a Di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Stone,</HI> be brought to the Te&s;t of Rea&s;on, the Arguments will be unan&s;werable, and that tho' &s;ome may object again&s;t the mo&s;t evident Matters of Fact, yet no Argu|ments are &s;trong again&s;t Demon&s;tration.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Of the Nature, Cau&s;es, Difference, and Symptoms of the <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Stone.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;ea&s;e of the Stone, either in the Kidneys or the Bladder, and that of the Gout, which are nearly related, are two of the mo&s;t cruel and inexorable Tyrants that per&s;ecute the Race of Mankind: So great is their Vio|lence, and &s;o unextingui&s;hed their Fury, that they afflict the unhappy Patients with &s;uch frequent and in&s;ufferable Tortures, as make Life an unde&s;irable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and rather a Burthen too hard to bear, than a State of Satisfaction and Enjoyment. And had not the All-wi&s;e Divine Author, planted in our Nature, &s;o &s;trong an Aver&s;ion to Death and Di&s;&s;olution, it is highly probable that many, grown utterly impatient of undergoing &s;uch
<PB N="2" REF="9">a Weight of Mi&s;ery, would lay Hands upon them&s;elves, and &s;oon put an End to their Calamities and their Lives together, the Grievance or the fir&s;t to much over-balancing the Plea&s;ure of the la&s;t. Some, it is true, of the&s;e forlorn Creatures, have endeavoured to ea&s;e them&s;elves by adventuring on the&s;e tra|gical Expedients, and, no doubt, Multi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">udes more wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d follow their Example, did not a Principle of Religion among Chri&s;tians, and a powerful In&s;tinct of Self-Pre&s;ervation among all Men, controul their Impatience, and prevent Self-execution: Nor is it a Won|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r they &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d prefer the Shades and Tran|quility or the Grave, to the Heats and In|quietudes of &s;uch acute Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be allowed, that of this Pair &s;o near y allied, the Stone and the Gout, the fir&s;t is the mo&s;t terrible, and di&s;tingui&s;hed for its Fiercene&s;s and Cruelty. This Lictor and Mini&s;ter of Death, inflicts, above all others, the &s;harpe&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ufferable Tortures: What a melancholy Scene! What a moving Spectacle of mortal Nature is it, to &s;ee the unhappy Patient extended on the Rack, groaning and crying out in Agonies of Di&s;tre&s;s and un&s;peakable Torment: E'er Night is half &s;pent, he wi&s;hes for Day; when Day appears, he longs for Night; Di&s;tracted
<PB N="3" REF="10">with his Sufferings, he lies wakeful, count|ing the Hours, any one of which, when protracted and multiplied by raging Mi&s;ery, &s;eems a numerous Train, &s;o &s;luggi&s;h and unprogre&s;&s;ive does Time grow under griev|ous Sufferings. He changes his Pillow, but not his Pain; new-makes his Bed, but keeps his old Inquietudes, and though he often turns from Side to Side, he never leaves his Agonies behind: They, haple&s;s State! know no Ce&s;&s;ation or Interruption: If they &s;ome|times remit and abate their Violence, they &s;oon recover their Strength, rekindle their Rage, and in&s;ult the Patient with as great Fury as before. It mu&s;t therefore be a com|mendable Action, and becoming an <HI>Ae&s;cu|lapian</HI> worthy to endeavour, with all his Might, to repel or di&s;able this Plague that &s;o much infe&s;ts Mankind; and therefore ac|cordingly I have undertaken to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who have already attacked this Pe&s;t with Skill and Vigour: For this is not the Work of a &s;ingle Aggre&s;&s;or, but as in hunting down a Fore&s;t Bea&s;t, or that enormous Bird the <HI>O&s;trich,</HI> many Champions unite their Power, armed with various In&s;truments of Death, Cutla&s;&s;es, Lances, Hooks, and Javelins, that with different Weapons and mutual A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance they may &s;ubdue the Enemy, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="11">oblige him to retreat; &s;o, as a ready Auxiliary, I bring my Forces, &s;uch as they are, to join tho&s;e of abler Combatants, in order to quell this formidable Enemy, at lea&s;t to dimini&s;h his Strength and re&s;train his Fury.</P>
<P>As to the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e, there are &s;carce any Part of the Body privileged from breeding Stones in their larger Cavities, or more minute Inter&s;tices, which are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure diver&s;ified, according to the Nature of the Bowels or Organs where they are pro|duced. They are found &s;ometimes in the external Mu&s;cles of the Body, as well as in the Lungs, the Stomach, the Liver, the Gall- Bladder, the Bowels or Contents of the Abdomen, as well as in the Tongue, the Brain, and even the Blood it &s;elf: For &s;eve|ral credible Authors have affirm'd, that upon opening a Vein, &s;mall Stones, together with the &s;pouting Blood have ru&s;h'd into the Re|ceiver. In all which Ne&s;t, the petrifying Prin|ciples, meeting and embracing each other, produce a &s;ingle Stone, or a Quarry of them But this Di&s;cour&s;e is confin'd to the Stone in the Kidneys, and that in the Bladder, which in this Di&s;&s;ertation I &s;hall con&s;ider as the &s;ame, and not as the Di&s;ea&s;e of a di&s;tinct Species When it is formed and &s;ettled in either Kid|ney, it is accompanied with various Symptoms
<PB N="5" REF="12">according as it is large or &s;mall, &s;mooth or rugged, fixed or loo&s;e, clo&s;ely or &s;lightly co|herent, <HI>i. e.</HI> hard and &s;olid, or friable and porous.</P>
<P>Of the minute Stone, that is, the Grit and Gravel, formed of &s;andy Rudiments in the Kidneys or Bladder, which however are per|fect Stones, there are three Sorts di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Colour, that is, White, Yellow, and Red. White is the native Complexion of the&s;e little Bodies, Atoms indeed, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e of the large&s;t Dimen&s;ion, as are the Sands on the Shore, when compared with the Rock at who&s;e Feet they lie: The&s;e pri|mitive Stones are, however, &s;o clo&s;e and un|porous, that the Cohe&s;ion of their Parts, are not to be uncla&s;ped and di&s;&s;olved, but with great Difficulty, in&s;omuch that they imitate the Hardne&s;s of the Diamond, and will po|li&s;h Gla&s;s, like the Du&s;t of that Jewel, as celebrated Authors a&s;&s;ert; and it facilitates our Belief of the indi&s;&s;oluble Structure of this Grit, when we reflect on the like Qua|lity in that called Hour-Gla&s;s Sand, which is found, by Experience, to be le&s;s porous, or more &s;olid than Flint; and therefore the Operators in Gla&s;s have laid a&s;ide the fir&s;t, and now employ the la&s;t, as Materials for their fine&s;t Works. But the&s;e minute white
<PB N="6" REF="13">Stones, cannot, as I conceive, give nephri|tick Pains, or a Fit of the Stone, unle&s;s a Collection or Congeries of them, are involv|ed or united by &s;ome adventitious, mucous, &s;limy, or other anomalous Matter, &s;o as to form a Moles or Bulk, large enough to ob|&s;truct the Mouths or Channels of the Uri|nary Pa&s;&s;ages, and that, it is true, may &s;ome|times happen; but, generally &s;peaking, &s;ince the minute pale Stones are &s;o &s;mooth and &s;mall, that they may enter with Ea&s;e the Ori|fices of the Urinary Aquaeducts, and pa&s;&s;ing through tho&s;e Conveyances, may, without creating Pain or Trouble, be excluded with the common Stream; and though there &s;hould be a great Quantity of that &s;mall in|coherent Sand, it may, however, without Difficulty, flow through the Ureters into the Bladder with the &s;erous Current, and toge|ther with it be di&s;charged.</P>
<P>As to the Yellow Gravel, it is evident that the minute Particles that compo&s;e it, are &s;tained with that Colour, by the alkalizate or lixivial Salts of the Urine, which abounds with &s;uch Contents: And this Mixture in the &s;mall Yellow Stones, is the Rea&s;on why they are le&s;s &s;olid, and more di&s;&s;oluble than the White of a purer Compo&s;ition; which is likewi&s;e ob&s;erv'd, and from the &s;ame Rea&s;on,
<PB N="7" REF="14">in the Stones generated in the Receptacle of the Gall, who&s;e Parts have not that &s;trict Connexion and clo&s;e Structure as the White.</P>
<P>The Red Gravel receives that Complexion, from being infected with a little Drop of Blood i&s;&s;uing from &s;ome lacerated Vein where the Gravel lay.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, if they are ragged and uneven, may, by pricking, vellicating, or wounding the tender Membranes that include them, cau&s;e either duller and heavier, or more a|cute Pains, according as they are arm'd with more or le&s;s pointed Angles whil&s;t they lie in the <HI>Pelvis</HI> or Ba&s;in of the Kidneys, and there rou&s;ed and di&s;turbed by the Motion of the Body on Foot or Hor&s;eback, rub up|on and fret the neighbouring Membranes; and &s;o nephritick Sufferings may ari&s;e from Gravel, which con&s;i&s;ts in real and perfect Stones, as before ob&s;erved, though called Sand, or a friable, gritty Matter, by Rea&s;on of their &s;mall Dimen&s;ion. This is the fir&s;t nephritick Symptom before a larger Stone is formed, which, however, is vexatious, and often attended not only with Pain, but much Inquietude, Sickne&s;s of the Stomach, and a general Di&s;order of the whole Oeco|nomy, while the &s;andy Atoms, that lie heap|ed up in the Kidneys, are worked and agi|tated
<PB N="8" REF="15">by the Motion of the Back or Loins, irritate and gaul their Membranes of exqui|&s;ite Sen&s;e during their Confinement in tho&s;e Lodgings.</P>
<P>It ought to be ob&s;erved, that there are often &s;ound in the Urine of Per&s;ons in good Health, or at lea&s;t not much di&s;tempered, a Red Gravel or Sand, that &s;ticks to the Sides of the Urinal or Chamber-pot that receives it; but this is not the genuine Gravel, that cau&s;es nephritick Sufferings, but the Produc|tion of the Blood in Per&s;ons of a &s;corbutick Di&s;po&s;ition, or a warm Temperament, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the true Gravel in this, that the la&s;t falls down, immediately after the Urine is rendered, to the Bottom of the Receiver, whereas the &s;purious Kind does not break off from its Mixture and Union with the Urine, till after &s;ome Hours &s;tanding in that Ve&s;&s;el, when it is at length loo&s;ed from its Embraces, precipitated and thru&s;t down by the Cold of the Air, and afterwards, if the Urine be gradually heated again, it will recover its former Connexion with it, which is not the Ca&s;e of the genuine nephri|tick Gravel: Be&s;ides, there is often ob&s;erved in Per&s;ons of &s;uch a Con&s;titution, a thin Sub|&s;tance floating on the Surface of their Urine, imitating melted Fat or Grea&s;e, but when it
<PB N="9" REF="16">is skimmed off, and dried upon a Paper placed in the Sun, it di&s;covers it &s;elf to con|&s;i&s;t of gritty &s;aline Concretions, united to|gether by &s;ome vi&s;cous or &s;limy Bonds.</P>
<P>If the Stones are of a larger Size than tho&s;e called Sand or Gravel, they affect Humane Bodies with yet more painful and afflictive Symptoms, and &s;uppo&s;ing that their Figure is unequal, and varied with many Angles; then their Points, e&s;pecially upon bodily Motion, vex and vellicate the Repo&s;itories where they are ne&s;ted, and as &s;o many &s;harp Thorns in the Sides of the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> continually grieve, prick, or wound their Membranes; whence ari&s;es the frequent Di&s;charge of bloody Urine, a common Symptom of this cruel Di&s;ea&s;e, which, if fre&s;h, and newly let out of the Veins, gives the Urine a red Co|lour, and the Blood is di&s;cernable to the Sight; but if it has lain, for &s;ome Time, ex|trava&s;ate in the Bladder, or if but a few Drops &s;tay in that manner in the Kidneys, by turning to grumous and coagulated Clots, they impart a dark and blacki&s;h Tincture to the Urine, not unlike to that of Coffee; this is a Symptom likewi&s;e that often accompa|nies this Di&s;temper: It is true al&s;o, that pale limpid Water &s;ometimes attends the Pa|roxy&s;ms of the Stone, like that ob&s;erved in
<PB N="10" REF="17">Convul&s;ive, Hypocondriacal, and Hy&s;terick Pa&s;&s;ions, and from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, that is, the Spa&s;modick Di&s;order or Contraction of the Sy&s;tem of the Nerves during the Fit.</P>
<P>Another Symptom, that accompanies the Stones la&s;t de&s;cribed, is great Sickne&s;s of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">omach, Nau&s;ea, and frequent Vomitings, or Strainings to Vomit; for while the Fibres in the Kidneys are grieved, and lacerated by the rough Stone or Stones bred and confined there, the Suffering is propagated to the Sto|mach by a Con&s;ent of Parts, or Communi|cation of Nerves, from one of tho&s;e Bowels to the other; and this is &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a Symptom of this Di&s;ea&s;e in the Kidneys, that other Symptoms without this, are not &s;uffi|cient to induce the Phy&s;ician to pronounce the Di&s;temper the Stone.</P>
<P>If the Stone in the Kidneys be &s;ome Degree larger, and likewi&s;e jagged, it creates un|&s;ufferable Pains, while it remains in the <HI>Pelvi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or Ba&s;in of the Kidneys, grating and lacera|ting the enclo&s;ing Membrane, or while if &s;trives through the Ureters, and wounds the Fibres as they make their Way.</P>
<P>When the Stone formed in the Kidneys is grown yet larger, and &s;o di&s;proportioned to the Mouth of the Ureter, that it cannot enter, even though its Superficies is &s;mooth and
<PB N="11" REF="18">equal, it will ob&s;truct the Orifice of that Tube, while it attempts to pa&s;s into it, or will &s;tick in the Channel of it; and while it continues fixed there, as it &s;tops the Current of the Wa|ter through the Pipe, &s;o it creates exqusite and enormous Mi&s;ery, by di&s;tending the &s;en&s;ible Membranes; and if it be unequal and ragged, it will produce the mo&s;t afflictive Tortures, till it is protrude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> by Art or Nature through the Ureter, and excluded into the Bladder. This happens as often as the Stone grows to a greater Size than is &s;uitable to the Inlet and Pa&s;&s;age of that Tube: And the Effect is the &s;ame if the Stone, though not of a di&s;propor|tinate Bulk to pa&s;s the Ureter, &s;hould how|ever lye a-cro&s;s the Orifice, for then it will ob&s;truct the De&s;cent of the Urine, and create great Di&s;order, till it find a proper Po&s;ition, and its Figure is adapted to the Inlet, and then it enters and is at la&s;t di&s;charged.</P>
<P>After the Stone has made its Pa&s;&s;age through the Ureters for &s;ome Years, by &s;tretching and enlarging the Road &s;o often, it becomes ca|pacious enough to receive much larger Stones than the fir&s;t, and to let them through into the Bladder; &s;o that the Cavity of the Ureter, through which they have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o long, is by Degrees &s;ometimes extended to a Finger's Breadth, as unque&s;tionable Authors a&s;&s;ure us.

<PB N="13" REF="20">&s;u&s;pecting he had a Stone in the Kidneys, tryed one Night in Bed, if he could not feel it, and by pre&s;&s;ing his Loins, much emaciated with his long Fingers, he a&s;&s;ured me he felt the Stone, and then, &s;aid h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, I reflected it mu&s;t be a large one propagated through that Bow|el, and therefore that no Medicinal Methods &s;hould be attempted to break it, le&s;t the Frag|ments falling into the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> &s;hould &s;top the Pa&s;&s;age of the Ureters, and create great Fits of the Stone; upon this, &s;aid he, I f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll a&s;leep, and during many Years, thought of it no more, till of late &s;ome Incident, which he named, and I have forgotten, brought again to his Mind this Ob&s;ervation, and when he (&s;ome Years afterwards) Died and was Di&s;&s;ected, a large Stone was found in his Kidney, which though he felt, as &s;aid before, yet lying un|di&s;turbed and quiet in its Ne&s;t, it gave him little Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Stone we are di&s;cour&s;ing of is either lighter or heavier, or which is the &s;ame thing, more porus and friable, or more clo&s;e and &s;o|lid. The Particles that compo&s;e the fir&s;t, hang together by a &s;light Connexion, which is ea&s;ily broken and di&s;&s;olved, like Flocks of frozen Snow, the Sides of a Spunge, or the un&s;olid and porus Sub&s;tance of the Pumice-Stone, and the&s;e by any internal or external Violence,
<PB N="14" REF="21">or milder Motion, are often &s;eparated and crumbled into Parts, that drop into the Ureters and pa&s;s into the Bladder, to be di&s;charged, and the&s;e Fragments, like the &s;mall &s;andy and gritty Stones &s;poken of before, produce the &s;ame trouble&s;ome Effects.</P>
<P>I have accounted for the Stones, that owe their Production to the Kidneys, and &s;hall now pur&s;ue their Progre&s;s and follow their Cour&s;e to the Bladder. When the Stone generated in the Urinary Strainer is di&s;charged by the Ure|ter into the common Receiver, it too often happens, that it acquires &s;o large a Dimen&s;ion, that the Outlet of the Bladder is not wide e|nough to let it through, and therefore of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity it mu&s;t remain impri&s;oned there, where by the Acce&s;&s;ion of new petrifying Particles, and gritty Matter continually de&s;cending from the Kidneys, and adhering to it, its Size is gra|dually augmented, till it is yet more incapable of being excluded, where if it is loo&s;e and float|ing, it produces many grievous Symptoms; for though it be only &s;mooth and equal, and &s;o does not lacerate the Bladder, yet it will often, as it plays again&s;t the Neck of it, and attempts to pa&s;s through, &s;top the Mouth of the Aquaeduct, that conveys away the Urine, and by &s;o doing, produces very great Torment, while the Bladder is exce&s;&s;ively di&s;tended, and
<PB N="15" REF="22">unable to di&s;charge the enclo&s;ed Deluge; and if the Stone be uneven and rugged, it will by goading and wounding the encompa&s;&s;ing Membranes, create exqui&s;ite Pain and bloody Urine, and by long repeated Cruelties of this Kind, it frequently forms an Ulcer in the lace|rated Part, which is di&s;covered by the Secre|tion of putrid Matter mingled with the Urine; for when it has &s;tood &s;ome Hours, a pale &s;limy Sediment is precipitated to the Bottom of the Receiver, like the Excrement of the No&s;e, or the Whites of Eggs, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed, from the like Matter that de&s;cends to the Bladder, from an Ulcer in the Kidneys, by the Odour, which is &s;trong and faetid, if the purulent Mat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">er comes from an Ulcer in the Bladder, but that derived from one in the Kidneys has no &s;uch offen&s;ive Smell, as &s;aid above. And the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame when an Ulcer ari&s;es in the Kidneys or the Neck of the Bladder, not from the Stone but from other Cau&s;es, &s;uch as pro|duce Ulcers in the Lungs, in the Inte&s;tines, or other internal Parts, that is, the Impurities and incongruous Particles, which by Rea&s;on of their di&s;proportionate Size and Figure, can|not &s;lide through the &s;trait Pa&s;&s;ages of the Glands, but &s;tick in them, till more of the like Nature entangled there, encrea&s;e the Ob&s;truc|tion and &s;well the Parts, whence by Degrees
<PB N="16" REF="23">they are inflamed, putrify, and by their Di&s;|ruption, form an Ulcer; and when this Di&s;ea&s;e is produced in the Kidneys or the Bladder, the putrid Contents i&s;&s;uing from them, and toge|ther with the Urine excluded into the Re|ceiver, &s;hew them&s;elves, as I have &s;aid, by their vi&s;cous and ropy Quality, and are di|ver&s;ified by their faetid or inoffen&s;ive Smell: And it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that their mucous and &s;limy Nature, di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e Contents from others, that proceed from a &s;corbutick or unhealthful Habit of Body, when much white, mealy, and light Matter appears in the Sediment, and which being without Con|nexion, upon &s;haking the Gla&s;s will ri&s;e and float incoherent in the Urine, but un&s;limy, as well as without Faetor: This therefore, as I have &s;aid, does not proceed from any internal Ulcer, but is a Defect ari&s;ing from &s;ome irre|gular and depraved State of the Blood, that communicates with its Serum &s;uch Matter to the Kidneys.</P>
<P>The Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine, occa&s;ioned by a Stone too large to pa&s;s the <HI>Urethra,</HI> is not at|tended with Sickne&s;s and Vomiting, as when a Stone &s;ticks in its Pa&s;&s;age through the Ure|ters, there being no Communication of Nerves between the Bladder and the Stomach, to con|vey the Sen&s;ations from one to the other. But
<PB N="17" REF="24">exqui&s;ite and grievous Pains however attend it from the Di&s;tention of the Bladder, as I have &s;aid, and &s;ometimes a &s;maller Stone, that has entered the Mouth of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> yet being too great to &s;lide through, &s;tops near the En|trance, or in the Middle, and creates a total Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine, as well as great Torment.</P>
<P>I have now accounted for the Nature, Pro|perties, and Symptoms of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and have likewi&s;e in carrying on my Di&s;cour&s;e, inter|mixed an Ennumeration of its various Kinds, di&s;criminated by the Receptacles, where the Stone is contained, or by its different Colour or various Shape and Figure; and now I &s;hall proceed to &s;earch into the Cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>The remote, antecedent Cau&s;e of the Stone, is a defect in the dige&s;tive Faculty of the Stomach, or that of the Blood, or nervous Juices, whence &s;uch Impurities and feculent Portions remain, as produce the Coagulations and Concre&s;cencies, that become the Founda|tion of the Stone, who&s;e Rudiments and pri|mitive Materials, con&s;i&s;t in a clo&s;e Combina|tion of a volatile in a &s;uperior, and acid Salt in an inferiour Proportion. That the&s;e two are the petrifying Principles, is known by Experience, that &s;hews us that this is the Effect of Acids and Alkalies meeting together; as for Example, <HI>Juice of Lemon, and Salt of Tartar;</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="25">Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed then, that from the inordi|nate and depraved Concoctions before-named, &s;uch hard Coalitions, &s;limy Coagulations, or cretaceous Confederacies &s;hould be left be|hind, and it is ea&s;y to conceive how, when yet more hardened and prepared in the Blood, they may by the Power of the urinous Salts in the Kidneys, be &s;oon converted into gritty, &s;andy Atoms, which, clu&s;tring together, and cohering, form at length a Stone of the lowe&s;t Size; that by the daily Acce&s;&s;ion of new &s;imi|lar Particles, acquires a far greater Dimen&s;ion in the Kidneys, and yet a greater after its De&s;cent from that Bowel to the Bladder; for while it is detained, from being too large to be excluded, it has more Room to receive Aug|mentation, whil&s;t con&s;tantly fed by the &s;andy Rivulets, that empty them&s;elves through the Outlets of the Ureters into that Ci&s;tern, where it grows by &s;uch Accretion, till &s;ometimes it becomes exceeding large: Thus petrified Fo&s;|&s;ils and Flints in the Earth, as well as rotten, Sticks and Pieces of Wood turned to Stone, owe their Growth, as well as Production, to lapide&s;cent or &s;tony Particles, that continually accede to, and &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ctly embrace the former col|lected Materials; But as to the intrin&s;ick Na|ture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he Stone bred in living Creatures, and tho&s;e la&s;t named, that is, Minerals and Vege|tables,

But of the&s;e Subjects I have di&s;cour&s;ed at large in my Treati&s;e of the Gout, to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>When the Seeds or Principles of the Stone, that is, the vi&s;cous, tough or &s;andy Concre|tions, not to be di&s;&s;olved and &s;eparated from the Blood, bearing however a Figure and Di|men&s;ion proper to enter the papillary Glands, the Strainers in the Kidneys, they are there yet more indurated, and acquire a gritty and &s;abu|lous Con&s;titution; though even in the Blood it&s;elf, before the Serum is &s;eparated from it by the &s;ecretory Glands, &s;mall Stones are often formed, as they are in all the Parts of the Body, as before ob&s;erved.</P>

<P>A &s;edentary and inactive Life, e&s;pecially when the Per&s;ons are of a vigorous and hot Complexion, much promotes the Production of the Stone; for while the Blood runs lazy and unagitated in its Channels, for want of due Labour and Exerci&s;e of the Limbs to pu&s;h on its Streams with due Celerity, it is ea&s;y to conceive how the crude and impure Parts run into various Concre&s;cencies and Coagulations.

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> The Method of Curing the <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Stone.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FIRST, of the lowe&s;t Degree of this Di&s;|ea&s;e, that is, the &s;mall Sand-like Gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t, either White, Red, or Yellow, which though very minute, yet are true Stones, and di&s;tinct from the &s;corbutick Red Matter, that does not &s;eparate and fall down from the Urine, till after &s;ome Hours &s;tanding, and then is pre|cipitated by the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Cold from the Ambient Air, as above de&s;cribed. The Cure of this Di&s;temper, con&s;i&s;ts in the carrying off the &s;abulous and &s;andy Atoms, and pre|venting the Generation of more, and &s;o cut|ting off the Supplies, that u&s;e to fill the Room of the forther, that are di&s;charged with the
<PB N="23" REF="30">Urine: And it is highly nece&s;&s;ary to attempt this, le&s;t otherwi&s;e the &s;mall Stones, continu|ing undi&s;turbed, &s;hould unite and adhere to each other, and receiving gradual Augmenta|tion, from new Particles daily arriving, &s;hould grow to a Stone of great Bulk, and become incapable of pa&s;&s;ing the Ureters, or at lea&s;t without great Difficulty and Pain; and when they &s;lide through and drop into the Bladder, &s;hould contract there a large Size as before de|&s;cribed. For it is highly probable, that the Stone is very &s;eldom originally generated in that Receptacle, and that all, or at lea&s;t the far greate&s;t Part found there, de&s;cend thither from the Kidneys, and receive their Encrea&s;e from the &s;andy and gritty Supplies, tran&s;mitted to it through the Ureters. It has therefore been an unhappy Neglect, committed by &s;ome Patients, that though they have long perceived a con&s;iderable Quatity of Gravel di&s;charged with their Urine, and have felt the Trouble and Unea&s;ine&s;s of it in their Kidneys, have however, taken little Care to clear them of the&s;e gritty Materials, and prevent the breed|ing of more; from which Omi&s;&s;ion, at length, Stones of a bigger Bulk, always painful and often fatal, have been produced.</P>
<P>It is therefore evidently the Intere&s;t of all Per&s;ons, when they ob&s;erve that a Quantity of
<PB N="24" REF="31">&s;uch Sand and Gravel, the Rudiments and Mo|ther of bigger Stones, is excluded with the Urine from the Bladder, to endeavour, by pro|per Means, to free the Kidneys from the&s;e noxi|ous Inhabitants, and prevent the Generation of new Supplies; and in the fir&s;t Place, it is requi&s;ite to convey away the Gravel, that is already bred, for which Purpo&s;e the following Method is mo&s;t efficacious.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t Purgatives.</P>
<P><HI>Take over Night, going to Bed, of Elixir Salutis, three Spoonfuls; and the next Morning, drink a Quart or three Pints of purging Mineral Waters, &s;uch as tho&s;e of</HI> Ep&s;om, Dulledge, Acton, Northal, <HI>&amp;c. And at Night going to Bed,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Take of Milk-Water, two Ounces; com|pound Water of Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, half an Ounce; twelve Drops of liquid Lauda|num, and three Drachms of Diacodium; make it a Draught: repeat both Medi|cines every other Day and Night, for three Times.</HI></P>
<P>After an Interval of three Weeks do the &s;ame, and &s;ooner, if the Symptoms of the Gravel call for it.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="32">
<P>Or, <HI>Drink alone, two Quarts of &s;uch purg|ing Waters &s;everal Days, and then re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why the&s;e Waters are very be|neficial for the Purpo&s;e intended, is, that a con&s;iderable Part of them pa&s;s by Urine, and in their Pa&s;&s;age through the Kidneys, wa&s;h away in their Current the Sand and Gravel, and &s;uffer them not to lodge there, till they grow to a Stone of a large Size: And 'tis the &s;ame in re&s;pect of the Bladder; for the &s;ame Flood that ru&s;hes down through the Ureters, carries off the Gritt from the Receiver, and expels it with the Urine.</P>
<P>Diureticks, to be employed in the Intervals of purging, for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, are &s;uch as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Roots of Chervil, Stone Par&s;ley, Eringo, Fennel, Sorrel, each half an Ounce; of Seeds of Burdock, Ani&s;e, and &s;weet Fennel, each a Drachm; of Juni|per Berries, three Drachms; boil the&s;e Ingredients, in three Pints of Spring-Water, to a Quart; add to it, a Drachm of purified Nitre; &s;train it, and add a Pint of Rheni&s;h Wine: Drink a Quar|ter of a Pint Morning and Evening.</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>Take Millepedes alive and wa&s;hed, fifty, brui&s;e them in a Mortar, with a
<PB N="26" REF="33">Quarter of a Pint of Rheni&s;h Wine, and four Ounces of compound Hor&s;e-radi&s;h Water; make a &s;trong Expre&s;&s;ion for a Draught, to be taken twice a Day.</HI></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t effectual Diuretick for carry|ing off Gravel, and clearing the Parts afflicted with it, are mineral unpurging Waters, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the <HI>Bath, Tunbridge,</HI> the <HI>Spaw,</HI> and other Chalybeate Springs: For the&s;e, ru&s;hing with a plentiful Tide through the uri|nary Organs where the Gravel is lodged as well as generated, di&s;turbs its &s;everal Ne&s;ts, and rolls along in its Stream, the Sand-beds it meets in its Way, till at length they are di&s;|charged in the Urine. But this is not the only Advantage, that attends the drinking co|piou&s;ly Chalybeate Waters; for be&s;ides this, it very much contributes the laying the Axe to the Root of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and preventing the Generation of &s;uch petrifying Seeds, as &s;hall be &s;hewn afterwards. There are other diure|tick Remedies u&s;eful in this Di&s;temper; as a Mixture of Water, <HI>French</HI> Brandy, and Juice of Lemon, called Punch, if made &s;mall, and not intoxicating, though taken in a con&s;ide|rable Quantity. <HI>Juice or Syrup of Lemons; Syrup of Mar&s;h-mallows; and fre&s;h Oil of Sweet Almonds;</HI> of each an equal Portion,
<PB N="27" REF="34">mixed and beat together, with as much Sugar as is &s;ufficient to give them a Con&s;i&s;tency, taken to a Spoonful or two often in a Day, is very beneficial; &s;o is a Spoonful or two of <HI>compound Juniper-Water of</HI> Cologne, <HI>or</HI> Holland, <HI>drank now and then in a Gla&s;s of White-wine;</HI> add to the&s;e Remedies, the ex|erci&s;e of the Body, by riding &s;ometimes on a hard trotting Hor&s;e, &s;ometimes by hurrying in a Coach over paved Stones, or other rugged and uneven Ground, (if the Patient can bear it) which by the repeated working and Con|cu&s;&s;ion of the Back, move and di&s;lodge the Gravel in the Kidneys, and force it thence into the Bladder, whence it is excluded with the Water.</P>
<P>Now to prevent the Production of little Stones or Gravel, all tho&s;e Remedies are re|quired as mo&s;t effectual, that have an opera|tive Vertue, to loo&s;e and di&s;engage all vi&s;cous and tough Coagulations, and di&s;&s;olve the Co|he&s;ion and Structure of cretaceous and gritty Coalitions, whence &s;mall Stones and Gravel are created, &s;ome in the Blood, and others in the urinary Strainers. This is indeed a Matter of the greate&s;t Importance in this Ca&s;e; for if this is effected, the formidable and pernicious Di&s;ea&s;e will be cru&s;hed in Embrio, and not &s;uf|fered to arrive at a mature State. I &s;hall there|fore
<PB N="28" REF="35">&s;et down the Medicines, endowed with the greate&s;t Force, for procuring this End.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that tho&s;e Remedies, that re&s;tore the Blood when depraved, to its native Temperament, and keep it in that ju&s;t and &s;a|lutary Con&s;titution, which &s;pecifially belongs to this Animal Fluid, are in general to be cho|&s;en; and in this Ca&s;e in particular, tho&s;e are to be in&s;i&s;ted on, that are mo&s;t capable of di&s;|joyning and &s;eparating the a&s;&s;ociated, vi&s;cous, and &s;andy Particles, that con&s;pire to the For|mation of a Stone, and &s;o to attenuate and refine them, that they may ea&s;ily incorporate with the Blood, and produce an uniform and equal Mixture.</P>
<P>And for this Purpo&s;e, Chalybe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">te Medicines, prepared by Art or Nature, are the mo&s;t pre|ferable: And &s;ince Patients afflicted with this Di&s;ea&s;e, are commonly of a hotter Con&s;titu|tion than others, tho&s;e Preparations that have the lea&s;t Sulphur left in their Compo&s;ition, are mo&s;t beneficial to them; &s;uch as the <HI>Salt of Steel,</HI> or the Tincture of it in Wine: But a|bove all, mineral Waters, impregnated with Steel in Embrio, are in this Ca&s;e mo&s;t cele|brated, which not only dilute and attemper the Blood, and carry off in their Current the &s;andy and petrifying Materials, as before ex|plained, but likewi&s;e by their active Vertue,
<PB N="29" REF="36">animate, ferment, and exalt the Blood, break the Cohe&s;ion of the knotty and cretaceous Seeds of the Stone, and by wre&s;ting the Parti|cles from each others Embraces, prevent the engendering of this Di&s;ea&s;e, by the Confede|racy of &s;uch Impurities. So that the&s;e &s;alu|tary Springs, are not only highly u&s;eful in free|ing the Veins from immi&s;cible and hurtful Matter, clean&s;ing the Urinary Channels, and rolling away in their Flood, the Gravel lodged in the Cavities, through which their Waters make their Way, but they likewi&s;e very much contribute to the Recovery of a ju&s;t Cra&s;is, or Con&s;titution of Blood, by de&s;troying the Prin|ciples and Rudiments of this Di&s;ea&s;e, 'ere yet they combine in a Stone of large Size, and reach a mature State, which they effect in the Manner de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But if hard and gravelly Materials, a&s;&s;ociate and unite in the Kidneys, by a &s;light Structure, and are rather entangled one with another, and hang together like a piece of Spunge, Hoar-Fro&s;t, or a Flake of Snow, than &s;trictly co|here, whence they become very porus and friable; or if when more clo&s;ely complicated and connected, they grow to a greater Bulk, and create great Pain either in the Kidneys or the Ureters, by grating the Membranes with their unequal and ragged Figure in their Pa&s;|&s;age,
<PB N="30" REF="37">or by their too large and di&s;proportionate Size, &s;top at the Entrance, or in their Way through the&s;e Tubes, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, the proper Remedies do remove them from the Kidneys, and oblige them to pa&s;s the Uteters into the Bladder, are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>

<P>Of Milk-Water, two Ounces; of compound Hor&s;e-radi&s;h-Water, three Drachms; of crude Opium colated, a Grain and half; Syrup of Mar&s;h-mallows, half an Ounce; make it a Draught: And if the Stone or Gravel, be not removed, but the Fit con|tinues, take the next Morning, two Quarts of the &s;ame purging Waters, either <HI>Ep&s;om, Dulledge, Acton,</HI> &amp;c. and the Night following, the &s;ame compo&s;ing
<PB N="31" REF="38">Draught, and &s;o the next Morning and Night, for three Times, during the Fit; and if notwith&s;tanding, the Paroxy&s;m is &s;till prolonged, then let the Patient take the following Draught, going to Bed, every Night, if the Pains are vio|lent, or otherwi&s;e every other Night.</P>
<P>Take of Oil of Sweet-Almonds, and Ounce; of the pectoral Decoction, a Quarter of a Pint; of Syrup of Meconium, ten Drachms; make a Draught.</P>
<P>Take al&s;o &s;uch oily and diuretick Medicines as follow.</P>
<P>Take of Oil of Sweet-Almonds, and Lin|&s;eed, drawn without Fire, each an Ounce; of Syrup of Lemons and Mar&s;h-mallows, each ten Drachms; of Saffron, a Scruple; of fine Sugar, as much as is &s;ufficient; let it all be well mixed in a marble Mortar, and made a Linctus. Let the Patient take a Spoonful or two often in a Day and Night.</P>
<P><HI>Small Punch likewi&s;e, e&s;pecially if made with <HI>Spaw</HI>-Water, is u&s;eful to pu&s;h on the Stone, or Gravel, when either of them &s;ticks in the Ureters, and to clear the Kidneys of the Beds of Sand collected there.</HI></P>
<PB N="32" REF="39">
<P>Juniper-Water, e&s;pecially that of <HI>Cologne,</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> and the diuretick Apozem, above &s;et down, are beneficial.</P>
<P><HI>To be more particular, let the Patient in the Paroxy&s;m, that eludes the Force of the forementioned Remedies, take the following.</HI></P>
<P>Take of Flowers of Camomile, two Hand|fuls; Roots of Mar&s;h-mallows, &s;ix Drachms; of wild Carrot-Seed, half an Ounce; of Venice Turpentine, di&s;&s;olved with the White of an Egg, three Drachms; of the Electuary of Hiera cum Agarick, &s;ix Drachms; make it a Cly&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Or,</HI> Take of the common emollient Decocti|on, twelve Ounces; adding to the Ingre|dients Juniper-Berries, &s;ix Drachms; Seeds of the wild Carrot, three Drachms; di&s;&s;olve in it of Lenitive Electuary, ten Drachms; u&s;e it for a Cly&s;ter.</P>
<P>Let one of the&s;e Cly&s;ters be given every Day, for three or four Times.</P>
<P><HI>For ea&s;ing the Paroxy&s;m, it will likewi&s;e be very Advantagious, for the Patient to &s;it up to the Wa&s;te, in a</HI> Bath <HI>of Lukewarm Water, and repeat it two or three Times, or in a medicated</HI> Bath, <HI>which may be made thus.</HI></P>
<PB N="33" REF="40">
<P>Take of the Leaves of Mallows, Mar&s;h-mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, each three Handfuls; Flowers of Camomile, Melilot, and Elder, each two Handfuls; Tops of Camomile, two Handfuls; Juni|per-Berries, &s;ix Ounces; of Lin&s;eed, and Fenugreek-Seed, each two Ounces; boil all in a &s;ufficient Quantity of Spring-Water, and let the Patient &s;it in it Lukewarm, up to the Wa&s;te, in a Ba|thing Tub.</P>
<P><HI>In this Ca&s;e al&s;o, there are va&s;t Varieties of Remedies, pre&s;cribed by celebrated Authors, as Fomentations, Liniments, Plai&s;ters,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to be externally applied, which notwith&s;tand|ing, are little availing for removing a Fit of the Stone, or Gravel: The mo&s;t effectual, are certainly the U&s;e of purging Mineral Waters, three or four Times, and tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng at Night, af|ter their Operation, a Grain and half of</HI> Opium, <HI>as before-mentioned, or an equivalent Quan|tity of</HI> liquid Laudanum, <HI>that is, about thirty Drops.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But in Ca&s;e that Method &s;hould not &s;uc|ceed, the next mo&s;t valuable Medicines are Pills made of</HI> Venice-Turpentine, <HI>or rather</HI> Chios, <HI>taken to the Quantity of a Scruple, alone, or mixed with an equal Part of</HI> Rhubarb.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="41">
<P>Or, Thus,&mdash;<HI>Take of Venice, or Chios-Tur|pentine, four Scruples; of Rhubarb, a Drachm; of Salt of Tartar, half a Drachm; Cinnamon, half a Scruple; of Bal&s;amick Syrap, as much as will make a Ma&s;s, to be formed into Pills of ordi|nary Size; take four every other Day, at Bed Time.</HI></P>
<P>For the &s;ame End, Emul&s;ions are condu|cive, &s;uch as the&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>Of Sweet-Almonds blanched, number fif|teen; of Seeds of Melons, Pumpions, Violets, each two Drachms; brui&s;e them together in a marble Mortar, pouring on them, gradually, a Quart of Barley-Water; &s;train it for u&s;e; drink often of it, a Quarter of a Pint, or &s;ix Ounces, Day or Night.</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>Take of Seeds of Violets, three Drachms; of Seeds of Pumpions, Me|lons, white Poppies, each two Drachms; eight blanched Sweet-Almonds; brui&s;e them together in a Mortar, and pour upon them, Milk-Water, and Corn Poppy-Water, each a Pint, &s;train it, and make it an Emul&s;ion to be drank as the others</HI></P>
<PB N="35" REF="42">
<P>Oily Medicines, are likewi&s;e very u&s;eful, as they envelop and &s;often the acid and acrimo|nious Juices, and promote the Expul&s;ion of the Stone, as thus,</P>
<P><HI>Take two Spoonfuls of Lin&s;eed-Oil, newly drawn, without Fire, twice a Day.</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>Take new Oil of Sweet-Almonds, and Lin&s;eed-Oil, drawn without Fire, each an Ounce; of Syrup of Mar&s;h-mallows, and Violets, of each &s;ix Drachms; of Syrup of Lemons, half an Ounce; of Saffron, rubbd fine, half a Scruple; mix them well to make a Linctus: Take a Spoonful often, &s;haking it well.</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>Take an Ounce of fre&s;h Oil of Sweet-Almonds, in a Quarter of a Pint of the Decoction for the Syrup of Mar&s;h-mal|lows, and repeat it frequently.</HI></P>
<P>Riding in a Coach, or on Hor&s;eback, in rough unequal Ground, or our paved Streets, conduces much to the Di&s;charge of the Stone, or Gravel, when either one or t'other &s;ticks in the Ureter, or <HI>Pelvis,</HI> if the Patient can endure it.</P>
<P>And while the&s;e Remedies are made U&s;e of, opiate Medicines mu&s;t be given, mingled with them, or alone, to abate the &s;pa&s;modick Con|traction

<P><HI>Take of crude Opium, di&s;&s;olved and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rained, a Grain and half, or two Graine; of the pectoral Decoction, a Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ter of a Pint; Syrup of Lemons, three Drachms; make it a Draught, to be taken at Night, or at any Time when the Pain is violent, and repeat it as the Symptoms &s;hall re|quire.</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>Take of Cinnabar of Antimony, half a Scruple; Crabbs-Eyes and Coral, of each &s;ix Grains; Laudanum Opiatum, a Grain and half; make it a Powder, to be taken at the Draught now pre&s;cribed.</HI></P>
<P>If the Patient is di&s;po&s;ed to Vomiting, or &s;training to Vomit, let him take two Spoon|fuls of the following Mixture, and repeat it four or five times, once in four Hours.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Mint-Water, or Barley Cinnamon-Water, two Ounces; of Juice of Lemons,
<PB N="37" REF="44">two Ounces; of Salt of Wormwood, a Drachm and half; of Laudanum, a Grain and half; make a Mixture.</HI></P>
<P>For ea&s;ing the Pain, and facilitating the Pa&s;&s;age of the Stone, or Gravel, various diu|retick Remedies are recommended, by emi|nent Phy&s;icians, the following Decoction of <HI>Forre&s;tus,</HI> is for this Purpo&s;e, much cried up.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Seeds of Mallows, Mar&s;h-mal|lows, each two Drachms and half; of fat lenten Figgs, cut and &s;liced, num|ber nine; Sebe&s;tens in number &s;even; boil the&s;e Ingredients in three Quarts of Water, to three Pints: This &s;oft and &s;lippery Decoction, like that for making Syrup of Mar&s;h-mallows, or the pectoral Decoction, in the</HI> London <HI>Di&s;pen&s;atory, may be improved by o|ther diurclick Ingredients,</HI> (viz.) <HI>Seeds of Burdock, Roots of Fennel, Violets, Eringo, wild Carrots, Juniper-Berries,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>GENTLE Purgatives of <HI>Sena, Rhubarb, Elixir Salutis,</HI> &amp;c. taken once in a Month or &s;ix Weeks, are beneficial, as they clean&s;e the Stomach, and their appending Roads from their Impurities, and the crude and unconcocted Remains of the Foods inge&s;t|ed; but the be&s;t Way is frequently to u&s;e purg|ing

<P>But for clean&s;ing the Kidneys, and carry|ing off the Sand and gritty Concre&s;cences, le&s;t by daily Augmentation, they &s;hould at la&s;t form a larger Stone, &s;lippery and oily Re|medies, and Turpentine, &s;uch as mentioned above, Whey, and above all, unpurging Mi|neral Waters of all Kinds, but chiefly the Cha|ybeate, &s;uch as <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> mu&s;t be relied upon; or the <HI>I&s;lington</HI> Waters, call'd <HI>New-Tunbridge.
<PB N="40" REF="47">Millepedes,</HI> are al&s;o a good Diu|retick in this Ca&s;e: But I have above treated on this Subject, where I have di&s;cour&s;ed on the Gravel, and &s;mall &s;andy Concretions, which are the minute&s;t real Stones, and the Seeds and Rudiments, that by their Con&s;luence and Coherence, produce tho&s;e of a greater Dimen|&s;ion, and to that Di&s;cour&s;e I refer the Reader; for the true Method of pre&s;erving the Patient from the Return of his Paroxy&s;ms, is to pre|vent the Generation of &s;uch fabulous Mate|rials, out of which the Stone is made, or to carry them off before they have formed &s;uch large Bodies.</P>
<P>It is very u&s;eful in a Paroxy&s;m of the Stone, to go into a <HI>Bath</HI> of Spring-Water moderately warm, which by &s;topping Sweat and Per&s;pi|ration, and &s;oothing the Spirits, relaxing and dilating the Fibres, promotes Urine, and therefore the Protru&s;ion and Expul&s;ion of the Stones, that hang or &s;tick in the Ureters which after they have acquired a con&s;iderable Magnitude, will notwith&s;tanding &s;trive and make their Way for a while through th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"> Tubes, which are much &s;tretched and enlarged by being the beaten Road for Stones to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> from the Kidneys to the Bladder; yet at lengt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> they encrea&s;e to &s;uch a Size, that when they have entered the Orifice of the Ureter, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">

It is therefore evident to a Demon&s;tration, that no total Suppre&s;&s;ion of the Urine can happen, where both the Ureters are not entirely &s;topped; and it is hard to con|ceive how at any Time two Stones &s;hould at once fall down, one from each Kidney, and &s;top in the &s;ame In&s;tant, each of tho&s;e Organs
<PB N="42" REF="49">of Separation: If therefore a full Stoppage of Water happens, and neither of the Ureters was before that Time ob&s;tructed, it is mo&s;t agree|able to Rea&s;on, that we &s;hould a&s;&s;ign another Cau&s;e of that Event, that is, a paralytick Im|potence of the &s;ecretory &s;mall Tubes and pa|pillary Glands, which &s;train the Serum from the Blood, through the Kidneys and Ureters, into the Bladder; for if the&s;e &s;ecretory Tubes by a <HI>Paraly&s;is</HI> affecting the Spirits re&s;iding in them, quite lo&s;e their Ten&s;ion and falling flat together clo&s;e up their <HI>Foramina,</HI> or Pa&s;&s;ages, no Serum can be longer &s;eparated from the Blood, or conveyed into the Receptacle of the Urine; and this will prove as effectual and adaequate a Cau&s;e of a total Ob&s;truction of Urine, as if both the Ureters were compleatly &s;topped by the falling of two Stones of di&s;|proportionate Size into their Mouths. And this was the Ca&s;e of an illu&s;trious Per&s;on, one of the fir&s;t Rank of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, who having for &s;everal Years been afflicted with the Gout, one Day felt a &s;evere Pain in one of his Shoulders, which after &s;ome Time cea&s;ed to afflict him; but he had not been long at Ea&s;e, when the Flow of his Urine was entirely interrupted, and continued &s;o to the eleventh Day, when the noble Patient expired, not|with&s;tanding all the Means and Methods that
<PB N="43" REF="50">his Phy&s;icians, of whom I had the Honour to be one, could direct for his Recovery. Upon opening the dead Body there appeared, when the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dneys were divided, &s;ome &s;mall Stones in the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> and others entangled in the Fibres or Strings of the Kidneys, but no Stone in the Mouth or Channel of either Ureter; &s;o nothing can be more certain, nor more ob|vious to the meane&s;t Capacity than this, that the Stone could not be the Cau&s;e of hindring the Water from de&s;cending into the Bladder, no Stone being found in the Ureters, nor in the Kidneys, of a Size capable of &s;topping the Tubes before-named; and had there been bred in the Kidneys, any Stones of a &s;ufficient Big|ne&s;s, to have compleatly &s;topped the Ureters, yet it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, as before &s;ugge&s;ted, that two Stones of &s;uch a Magnitude fell at the &s;ame In&s;tant, one into the Orifice of each Ureter, el&s;e a total Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine could not have followed; and this mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;carce ever to have happened, and is but bare|ly po&s;&s;ible. But <HI>de facio,</HI> there were no &s;uch Stoppage found in either Ureter. Yet not|with&s;tanding one of the Phy&s;icians declared his Opinion, and ob&s;tinately per&s;evered in it, that the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine, of which the Patient dyed, proceeded from the Stone in The Kidneys.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the be&s;t pre&s;ervatory Means again&s;t the Return of this formidable Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ince the true and effectual Way, as mentioned above, is either to enable the active Princi|ples of the Blood to keep the Ma&s;s in &s;uch an equal, regular, and ju&s;t Mixture, and to refine and exalt it to &s;uch an healthful State, as may prevent the Generation of hard and gritty Con|cre&s;cences, that as they are the Foundation of the Stone, &s;o they admini&s;ter Materials for the Super&s;tructure; and for procuring this End, the Remedies already enumerated are mo&s;t availing, in as much as they animate and enliven the Spirits, refine and elevate the Ma&s;s of Blood, and di&s;&s;olve and &s;ever creta|ceous or &s;andy Coalitions, by maintaining its Circulation with a due Celerity. To the&s;e may be added &s;uch Medicines as &s;ubdue the acid and acrimonious Quality of the Juices, by blunting and &s;moothing their &s;harp Points and Angles, &s;uch as <HI>Coral, Crabbs-Eyes, Crabbs-Claws, Oy&s;ter-&s;hells,</HI> and other te&s;taceous, ab|&s;orbing and correcting Powders, given with <HI>A&s;&s;es-Milk,</HI> or mixed with other Ingredients in Pius or Electuaries; and likewi&s;e tho&s;e, that are proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t the dige&s;tive Faculty of the Stomach, to concoct the Foods and Liquors it receives, into a whole&s;ome well-laboured and duly mixed Ma&s;s of Chyle, that the un|concocted

<P>Sometimes <HI>Take of Elixir Propriet at is tar|tari&s;ed, five and twenty, or thirty Drops in a Gla&s;s of Mountain White-wine, twice a Day,</HI> viz. <HI>at about Eleven and Four.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Remedies, moderate Exerci&s;e, pure and well ventilated Air, Regularity and Temperance, in Eating and Drinking, mu&s;t be carefully ob&s;erved, without which the be&s;t Methods of Phy&s;ick may be unavailing.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e Medicines called by the <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;icians <HI>Lithontriptica,</HI> that is, &s;uch as break and di&s;&s;olve the Stone, either in the Kidneys or Bladder, and to which many Em|piricks have pretended, a&s;&s;uring us that they gradually wear and crumble it away, and re|duce
<PB N="47" REF="54">it to &s;uch minute Fragments, that they ea&s;ily pa&s;s the Ureters into the Bladder, and with the &s;ame ea&s;e &s;lide through, and are ex|cluded thence together with the Urine: I ac|knowledge I am incapable of conceiving how a Medicine inge&s;ted by the Mouth can produce this Effect. It is true, that the celebrated <HI>Car|thaginian</HI> General <HI>Hannibal,</HI> as Hi&s;torians re|port, found means by Vinegar, or &s;ome in|vented &s;harp and acid Liquor, to di&s;&s;olve the <HI>Alpine</HI> Rocks, and &s;o to eat his Way through tho&s;e Mountains into <HI>Italy.</HI> But if any Pa|tient, afflicted with the Stone, &s;hould &s;wallow a proper Quantity of this powerful Fluid, were it to be had, or any other of like Vertue, &s;ince it mu&s;t fir&s;t undergo a great Alteration by the Ferment and dige&s;tive Faculty of the Stomach, and then a farther by mixing with the bilious Humours de&s;cending from the Gall-Bladder, and afterwards with the acid Juices i&s;&s;uing from the <HI>Pancreas,</HI> and then another by pa&s;|&s;ing the lacteal Strainers, and mingling its Stores with the Lympha brought by numerous Water-Pipes into the common Receptacles; then another by its Admi&s;&s;ion into the Veins, where during repeated Circulations with great Celerity, the Parts by innumerable Attritions, Reverberations, and Glances from their violent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;hing and beating one upon another, receive
<PB N="48" REF="55">Comminution, and are attenuated, ex|alted, and &s;moothed, till they acquire a re|fined volatile State; and at la&s;t of all, &s;ince they mu&s;t receive another Alteration by entering and pa&s;&s;ing the urinary Strainers in the Kid|neys: Let, I &s;ay, all the&s;e Changes be contem|plated, and will not, do you think, the Medi|cine inge&s;ted be unedged and di&s;armed of its &s;harp Points and Angles, and lo&s;e all its di&s;|&s;olving or Stone-cutting Quality? For no a cid Juices, not Vinegar it&s;elf, continue acid after they have mingled and circulated with the Blood, and have felt for &s;ome Time, the di|ge&s;tive Power of its active Principles.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e bold Per&s;ons therefore that pretend to be Ma&s;ters of Remedies, which given by the Mouth, will break or di&s;&s;olve the Stone in the Kidneys, or the Bladder, impo&s;e upon Man|kind, not only becau&s;e the Medicine lo&s;es its peculiar Qualities, by undergoing &s;uch a Va|riety of Changes and Alterations, as have been enumerated, but likewi&s;e by mingling and being diluted with above Twenty Pound of Blood, (for few Men have le&s;s) and frequent|ly running its Circuit with it, by which means it becomes quite another Thing, before it reaches the Stone it was de&s;igned to di&s;&s;olve or crumble to pieces.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="56">
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as above-menti|oned, there are &s;ome porus, light, and friable Stones, who&s;e Con&s;tructure is &s;o &s;light, that they will by a little Shock or Colli&s;ion, crum|ble, and be divided into &s;mall Fragments, while the Parts of others &s;o &s;trictly cohere, that they are &s;carcely capable of Separation; and it is of the&s;e harder and more &s;olid Stones that I &s;peak, when I &s;ay they cannot be broken, or cut in pieces, by Remedies given at the Mouth, but they defy the Edge of the keene&s;t <HI>Lithon|triptick</HI> Weapon in all the Ar&s;enals of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>When therefore Stones or Gravel are at any Time removed from the Kidneys, and exclu|ded with the Urine, it is not by Vertue of any Stone-breaking Medicine, acting upon them, but by the Operation of its diuretick Quality, exciting a great Separation of Serum, which ru&s;hing in a &s;wift Current through the Kid|neys, wa&s;hes away in its Streams the Gravel and Stones lodged there, that by their propor|tionate Magnitude are capable of pa&s;&s;ing the Ureters, as a &s;udden Storm or &s;harp Shower of Rain, rolls down the Streets in its Torrent, the Sand and loo&s;e Stones, as well as other promi&s;cuous Impurities to be carried off by the common Drain: Though it is very pro|bable that &s;ometimes this Flood of Serum,
<PB N="50" REF="57">tran&s;mitted from the Veins by its immoderate Quantity, as well as the Strength of its Tide, in its Pa&s;&s;age through the Kidneys, may like|wi&s;e di&s;unite, and &s;hatter to Pieces &s;ome &s;maller friable Stones, who&s;e Parts hang toge|ther by a very &s;light Connexion.</P>
<P>But if Nature or Art can afford any Medi|cines, that are capable of breaking a hard large Stone in the Bladder, the mo&s;t probable Way of making them effectual, would be to inject them directly into the Bladder; for then, having undergone none of tho&s;e various Al|terations above enumerated, which tho&s;e Re|medies mu&s;t do that are taken by the Mouth, they would exert their Stone-di&s;&s;olving Ver|tue, if they have any, entire and undimini&s;h|ed, and would have the great Advantage of acting upon it by immediate Contact, by which means the Stone in the Bladder, if it could be effected by Medicines, would be wa&s;ted and moulder away. But Experience &s;hews that this is not found practicable; for were &s;uch a Medicine di&s;covered, it would prevent the Tortures and Mi&s;ery of many un|happy Patients, and make the u&s;eful Art of Cutting for the Stone unnece&s;&s;ary, of which I &s;hall &s;peak afterwards.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="58">
<P>When large Stones are bred in the Kidneys, or &s;uch as cannot pa&s;s, but with great Pain and Difficulty, all forcing diuretick Medicines mu&s;t, be forborn, and only &s;uch as are &s;mooth, oily, and &s;lippery &s;hould be employed; le&s;t &s;uch as powerfully provoke Urine, &s;hould di&s;|turb and pu&s;h forward the bigger, that lay quiet in the Kidneys, into the Ureters, where they will either &s;top at the Entrance, or &s;tick in the Pa&s;&s;age, and by that Means either &s;hut up the Mouth, or create a violent Fit of Pain, together with bloody Urine, if their Surface be rough and ragged; and therefore in &s;uch Ca&s;es, &s;limy, &s;oft, and mucilaginous Remedies, are chiefly to be depended on, to promote the &s;lipping of the Stone into the Bladder: And if active Diureticks, have been employed in vain to pu&s;h on the Stone, which often hap|pens in a violent Paroxy&s;m, opiate Medicines of good Force &s;hould be given, that the Fibres of the enclo&s;ing Membranes, whil&s;t &s;timu|lated by the Torture of the Stone, and urged by the Medicine de&s;igned to expel it, being ea&s;ed and lulled by their narcotick Vertue, may cea&s;e to contract them&s;elves and cla&s;p the Stone &s;o clo&s;ely, and by dilating and re|laxing them&s;elves while at Ea&s;e, may make Way for it to &s;lide through into the Bladder.
<PB N="52" REF="59">But if the Stone in the Kidneys is large, &s;olid, and branches through their Sub&s;tance, no Means at all &s;hould be u&s;ed for its Cure; for if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">here are any Remedies that have Power to break and di&s;lodge its Fragments, which I be|lieve, as I have &s;aid, there are not, what would that be, but to &s;end them down to &s;top the Ureters, or to give un&s;ufferable Torments, by &s;ticking in their Channels!</P>
<P>As to the Stone in the Bladder, which, as &s;aid above, is no more than a Stone fir&s;t bred in the Kidney, and thence conveyed through the Ureters; where it receives its ob|long Figure, into the Bladder, and gains there &s;uch a Magnitude, that it becomes incapable of being expelled with the Urine, being fed and augmented continually with new Gritt and &s;andy Materials wa&s;hed from the Kidneys and falling down into the Bladder; when it fir&s;t de&s;cends into that Receptacle, and its Size does not exceed a due Proportion, while it floats in the Urine, it often plays, aims, and offers at the Orifice of the Urethra, but its Fi|gure or Po&s;ition not being accommodated to it, cannot pa&s;s through that urinary Channel; and then it not only creates great Unea&s;ine&s;s, by lying cro&s;s its Mouth, but likewi&s;e often by interrupting the Streams of Urine, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="53" REF="60">by totally ob&s;tructing the Pa&s;&s;age. When the Gravel, or Stone, or Stones, are yet &s;mall enough to enter and pa&s;s the Urethr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, to faci|litate their Di&s;charge, the Veins &s;hould be filled with &s;uch diuretick Liquors, as I have before &s;et down, that they may communicate a con&s;tant Flow of Urine to the Bladder, which being commonly kept full, will be the more apt to eject the Stone, together with the Flood that di&s;tends it. But if it grows &s;o great, that it becomes unable to make its Way, by Rea&s;on of its di&s;proportionate Size, it will be daily augmented by the Accretion or Ad|dition of new Gritt or Gravel, carried from the Kidneys, through the Ureters, by the Streams of Urine, as Sand and &s;mall Stones, are rolled along from a ri&s;ing Ground, by Rills of Water, that flow down its Sides. Now the&s;e Sands or minute Concretions, as I have ex|plained above, are the Seeds, or Mother of the Stone, that is, the Principles or fir&s;t Materials, that combine for the Formation of it in the Kidneys, and afterwards to its Augmentation in the Bladder; and to hinder its encrea&s;ing there to a great Magnitude, tho&s;e Remedies are to be u&s;ed which were enumerated before, for cutting off the Generation of Gravel, and &s;uch &s;andy and fabulous Combinations; to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="61">
<P>But if through Neglect, or the Inability of Methods and Medicines to prevent the breed|ing of Sand and Gravel in the Kidneys, which wa&s;hed away by the Urine into the Bladder, con&s;tantly feed and amplify the Stones con|fined there, which grow not like Animals and Vegetables, by Nouri&s;hment admitted by the Mouth or the Root, and conveyed and di&s;tri|buted to the outward Parts from the inward, but by the daily Acce&s;s, Accumulation, and Adhe&s;ion, of hard, &s;andy Particles to the Sur|face of the Stone; if, I &s;ay, the Stone, by the Arrival and Complication of new petrifying Principles, becomes large and ponderous, and being attended with a terrible Train of Symp|toms, that render the Patient a great Object of Compa&s;&s;ion, while Death is more eligible than Life, and no effectual Means can be &s;ug|ge&s;ted, how it may be cut, di&s;&s;olved, or crum|bled to pieces, as I have before demon&s;trated, all that can be done by Medicine, is to quiet or reduce the enormous Pains and Torments, inflicted by this cruel Di&s;ea&s;e; and for the ef|fecting of this, only <HI>crude Opium,</HI> or its Pre|parations, the Gift of Divine Benignity to mi|tigate the Tortures, and alleviate the extream Mi&s;eries of Mankind, can be depended on.

<PB N="55" REF="62">to allay his Agonies, and re&s;train the Rage of his Sufferings. And therefore in this Ca&s;e, let him take the following Pills.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Saffron, beat &s;mall, three Grains; of Extract of Gentian, &s;ix Grains; of crude Opium di&s;&s;olved and &s;trained, a Grain and half; Bal&s;amick Syrup, enough to make it into Pills, for one Do&s;e, to be taken in violent Pains, and repeated when the Force of the fir&s;t is worn off, if the Torments continue.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Quantity of <HI>Opium</HI> pre&s;cribed, is not &s;ufficient to remove the Pain, it may gra|dually be encrea&s;ed, by adding a Quarter of a Grain; and if that likewi&s;e &s;hould be ineffec|tual, add half a Grain, and &s;o on, till the Pa|tient has found what is the ju&s;t Quantity that will relieve him, and when he has taken his Mea&s;ure, and &s;ettled the Proportion, he will be obliged to take it as often as his Agonies &s;hall make it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. All &s;mooth, &s;oft, and &s;lippery Meats and Drinks, as well as Medicines mu&s;t be cho&s;en; for tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite Nature will irritate and enrage the Paroxy&s;m, e&s;pecially if an Ulcer
<PB N="56" REF="63">attends the Stone, which is an incurable Di&s;|ea&s;e: And as Ulcers produced either in the Kidneys, or the Neck of the Bladder, from other Cau&s;es be&s;ides the Stone, elude the Force of all Remedies, which is likewi&s;e the Ca&s;e of all other internal Ulcers in the Lungs, Liver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o tho&s;e, that ari&s;e from the Fret|ting and Laceration of the Membranes in the Kidneys or the Bladder, by Stones of a rough and ragged Superficies, can never be healed, at lea&s;t while the Stone continuing there, is always wearing and wounding the Part where it lodges: And therefore all that can be done, is to drink plentifully of &s;mooth, and &s;oft Li|quors, be&s;ides taking &s;lippery and oily Reme|dies, that may con&s;tantly dilute and wa&s;h a|way the ulcerous Matter, le&s;t gathering to|gether in too great a Quantity, it &s;hould &s;top the Pa&s;&s;age of the Urine; which Ob&s;truction is &s;ometimes &s;o great, that the Surgeon's Hand is nece&s;&s;arily required to pa&s;s his Catheter in|to the Bladder, for the Relief of the Patient, through which the impri&s;oned Urine may flow freely out; and the Patient is obliged to fly to this Refuge for Ea&s;e, as often as Cly&s;ters and other Medicines inge&s;ted by the Mouth are ineffectual. The &s;oft and &s;mooth Liquors that may a&s;&s;i&s;t the Patient, by diluting the
<PB N="57" REF="64">corrupt Matter, and making it fit to flow, are <HI>Mead,</HI> or other Liquors made of <HI>Honey;</HI> al&s;o Decoctions of <HI>Barley, Liquori&s;h, Mar&s;h-mal|lows, dryed Figgs, and Rai&s;ins of the Sun, &s;toned;</HI> or rather, the following Apozem.</P>

<P>The &s;moothe&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t Spring-Water, &s;hould be cho&s;en for common Drink, &s;uch as that of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> or any other, that ri&s;es from Chalk-Hills: A good Draught likewi&s;e of <HI>White-wine,</HI> and <HI>new Ale,</HI> [mind this] now and then repeated, is u&s;eful to di&s;lodge and carry off the noxious and impure Matter, i&s;&s;u|ing from an Ulcer in the Kidneys or Bladder; and the Sediment of each of them is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="58" REF="65">by their &s;limy, glutinous and ropy Quality, from the white, mealy and light Con|tents, found often in the Urine, from &s;cor|butick Cau&s;es, as above &s;ugge&s;ted, that by &s;haking the Gla&s;s, will pre&s;ently ri&s;e and float in the Bo&s;om of it, which however has no weight, nor vi&s;cous, nor gritty Quality, but &s;wims in pale, di&s;continued, and incoherent Matter, communicated to the Urine from the Blood, abounding with &s;uch Impurities. And they are di&s;criminated from one another, by a faetid and offen&s;ive Smell, proper to the Mat|ter di&s;charged from an Ulcer in the Bladder, and contracted from long mixing with the Urine, which is not found in tho&s;e &s;limy Con|tents that flow down from the Kidneys, and are excluded with the &s;erous Streams, as I have above explained.</P>
<P>After all, when notwith&s;tanding the due Care and Ob&s;ervance of the be&s;t Rules to pre|vent it, the Stone in the Bladder grows very large, and the Pains are greater than Humane Patience can bear, the la&s;t Refuge from this dreadful Tormentor, is manual Operation, when Inci&s;ion is made into the Bladder, and the Stone extracted through the Wound. So &s;trong is the Principle of Self-Pre&s;ervation, and &s;o terrible the Idea and Apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="59" REF="66">Death, that to continue a little longer in Be|ing, Men &s;ubmit, not only to a great Variety of lingering Sufferings and Calamities, but likewi&s;e to the acute&s;t Fains, or which their yeilding to this Method of curing the Stone, is a mo&s;t convincing Evidence.</P>
<P>Though the Cutting for the Stone is a pain|ful Operation, and attended with the Hazard of Life, yet many Patients have been relieved by it, and continued well after it for many Years, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, that were Cut in their Youth. Yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that many al&s;o have mi&s;carried, either from the Nature of the Stone, their ill Habit of Body, the Unskilfulne&s;s of the Operator, or his want or &s;ufficient knowledge in Surgery to heal the Wound. And this Misfortune often happens likewi&s;e from the Patient's deferring the Ope|ration too long, out of an Abhorrence of the Violence of the Cure, or from flattering Hopes that the Di&s;ea&s;e will not ari&s;e to that Extre|mity, and torment them with &s;uch in&s;uffer|able Symptoms. It is therefore the Intere&s;t of Per&s;ons afflicted with it, to undergo the Operation, by which the Stone is extracted, when as yet it is of a moderate Size, and there|fore more Ea&s;ily to be drawn through the Wound, and before their Strength is ex|hau&s;ted
<PB N="60" REF="67">by long Sufferings, and repeated Pa|roxy&s;ms of Torture, and before the Ulcer that is often formed by it, becomes deep and inveterate; and then, while their Vigour is unwa&s;ted, and their Con&s;titution otherwi&s;e hail, and the Stone not of an extraordinary Magnitude, the Operation is likely to be &s;uc|ce&s;sful: And if the&s;e Rules were ob&s;erved, the Lives of many of the&s;e unhappy Patients might be &s;aved, that are lo&s;t for want of a timely Submi&s;&s;ion to this Method of Cure.</P>
<P>When the Stone, lap&s;ed from the Kidneys into the Bladder, are not augmented there to that Proportion, as makes them incapable of entering into the Mouth of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> yet &s;ometimes after it has entered, it is however too large to make its Way through that Aquae|duct, and therefore &s;tops in the Road, where it not only creates great Pain, but likewi&s;e ob&s;tructs the Current of the Water, till at length there is no Remedy left but the Sur|geon's Art, who in this Ca&s;e ea&s;ily relieves the Sufferer, by cutting upon the Stone where he feels it lodged, and thru&s;ting it forth through the Orifice of the Wound: And this is the mo&s;t practicable and lea&s;t dangerous In&s;tance of Cutting for the Stone.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="68">
<P>As for Cutting into the Bladder, and ex|tracting the Stone thence, various Methods have been invented, of which a di&s;tinct and accurate Hi&s;tory is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Di&s;&s;ertation: It is enough for me in this Place to mention the mo&s;t Practicable and &s;afe&s;t Way, and this, as I am informed, is that of cutting into the Bladder, in the Region above the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> lately brought into U&s;e. Whe|ther there occur any dark and ob&s;cure Hints of this Practice in ancient or modern Authors, or whether the fir&s;t Invention does Honour to the ingenious Surgeon Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> it is certain, that either as Reviver or Inventor of this new Method, he has de&s;eryed well of Mankind, and merited the Thanks and E&s;|teem of all the Faculty, &s;ince all Ways of per|forming this Operation known before, were accompanied with more difficulty, more &s;uf|fering, and greater Hazard of Life.</P>
<P>Before the Patient con&s;ents to undergo this Method of Cure, great Care and Caution &s;hould be u&s;ed, that the Operator may be &s;ure him&s;elf, and &s;o able to &s;atisfy the Patient, that there is a Stone in the Bladder, the Cau&s;e of all his painful Symptoms, and fit to be ex|tracted. For there have been other Di&s;ea&s;es of the Bladder, that have &s;o perfectly imitated
<PB N="62" REF="69">the Stone in all its Symptoms, and have im|po&s;ed upon Surgeons, eminent in their Art, who after &s;trict Search have pronounced the Ca&s;e to be the Stone, yet when they have cut the Patient to relieve him, no Stone has been found, and upon opening the dead Body, ei|ther a <HI>Fungus,</HI> or &s;ome Excre&s;cency, grown to a great Bigne&s;s in the Neck of the Bladder, or &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e, or Errour of Nature in the Bladder, appeared to be the only Cau&s;e of all the Nephretick-like Symptoms, that afflicted the Patient: And therefore, I &s;ay, the Undertaker, before he attempts the Operation, ought with the greate&s;t Delibera|tion, and mo&s;t careful Scrutiny, to get the fulle&s;t Conviction in him&s;elf, of the real Exi&s;tence of the Stone in the Place he expects to find it.</P>
