<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER takes a view of the late well-intended at|tempts to recommend a le&s;s painful method of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the hae|morrhage from divided arteries, than is generally practi&s;ed, will find that the&s;e writers have omitted to a&s;certain by proper experiments the principles on which the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion depends; and upon enquiry the different theo|ries which have been invented by other writers will appear to be greatly defi|cient, and de&s;titute of any fact or ex|periment &s;ufficient to evince their truth.</P>
<PB N="viii" REF="4">
<P>Indeed Mr. Gooch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;es, p. 140. London 1758.</NOTE> has con&s;idered this affair nearly in its true light; but as what he &s;ays is only conjectural, it &s;eems not to have gained preference to the other hypothe&s;es which have been advanced; a very ingenious &s;ur|geon at this time adopting the opinion of Pouteau<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. White on Spunge.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In fact, this part of practice has al|ways been defective, by not learning from nature the true intentions to be an&s;wered. Hence, from not acting upon right principles, remedies have been applied at random; and nature has often effected a cure, in oppo&s;i|tion to the mo&s;t barbarous and im|proper
<PB N="ix" REF="5">applications. The different &s;pecifics which have been cried up and in vogue, and the multiplicity of remedies, &s;ufficiently point out the uncertainty with which this &s;ubject has been treated; for had the princi|ples on which we were to proceed been a&s;certained, the mo&s;t effectual applications would ea&s;ily have been di&s;covered, and the re&s;t di&s;carded as u&s;ele&s;s. And though &s;ince the needle and ligature were introduced, we have been more &s;teady in our practice, yet I apprehend we have, even in this particular, been not quite free from imperfection.&mdash;And were we not &s;o un&s;ettled, as to be near giving it up for remedies recommended with only &s;uppo&s;ed advantages?</P>
<PB N="x" REF="6">
<P>The following e&s;&s;ay is therefore in|tended to &s;upply the&s;e defects; and I hope, by proper experiments, and giving a new light to &s;everal facts, I have both a&s;certained the principles on which a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the flux from divided arteries depends, and what method mo&s;t &s;afely and effec|tually, under different circum&s;tances, an&s;wers this purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the natural or &s;pontaneous &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Haemorrhages from divided arteries.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN agaric of the oak was fir&s;t introduced in England, for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the haemorrhage from divided arteries, I made &s;everal experiments to try in what manner it pro|duced its effects; and I was &s;oon convinced, that it had no other property than that of ad|hering
<PB N="2" REF="8">clo&s;e to the mouth of the ve&s;&s;el: this circum&s;tance, together with con&s;idering how often the &s;maller arteries clo&s;e them&s;elves by their own natural contraction, and that it was common for very con&s;iderable arteries to be clo&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, when the impul&s;e of the blood was abated by the &s;wooning of the patient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Baron Van Swieten's Comm. vol. ii, p. 34. and Phil. Tran&s;. N^o 449. p. 313.</NOTE>, led me to imagine that the &s;ame thing mu&s;t of cour&s;e happen in the large arteries, provided the pa&s;&s;age of the blood through them be fir&s;t intercepted for a time, and that the clo&s;e contraction which was ob|&s;erved in tho&s;e arteries<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Warner's Ca&s;es, p. 136.</NOTE> to which the agaric had been applied, was intirely owing to the cour&s;e of the blood being impeded by block|ing up the end of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Every day's experience confirmed me in this opinion; for I found that the flux from very con&s;iderable arteries was ea&s;ily and ef|fectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by only making a per|pendicular pre&s;&s;ure a few minutes upon the end of the ve&s;&s;el.&mdash;But, in order to be more
<PB N="3" REF="9">certain about this matter, in the latter end of the year 1755 I made the following experi|ment.</P>
<P>After tying a large hor&s;e down, Mr. Peale of Maid&s;tone, then with me, took off one of his hind legs about the middle of the thigh: immediately upon the bone being divided, the hor&s;e drew the &s;tump towards his body, at which time the tourniquet &s;lipt off, and five arteries, the lea&s;t of them about the &s;ize of a wheat-&s;traw, &s;ome near as large as a goo&s;e|quill, and one much larger, poured out with great vehemence; but an immediate &s;top was put to the flux by a per&s;on pre&s;&s;ing with both hands upon the wound; and by continuing this pre&s;&s;ure fifteen minutes, the ve&s;&s;els be|came &s;o firmly clo&s;ed as not to di&s;charge the lea&s;t drop of blood. However I pa&s;&s;ed a needle and thread round one of the large&s;t, intending to make an experiment with the ligature.</P>
<P>The pul&s;ation at fir&s;t was very plainly &s;een at their extremities; but after &s;ome time it became le&s;s perceptible, and the wound was
<PB N="4" REF="10">covered with tow, which was kept on with very &s;light bandage.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e was kept alive forty-eight hours after the operation; and though he tumbled about and &s;truggled much in attempting to rai&s;e him&s;elf up, yet there was not any return of the haemorrhage, nor did there appear the lea&s;t pul&s;ation.</P>
<P>After he was killed we di&s;&s;ected the thigh, and found that the bleeding was not &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by congealed blood, but by all the ve&s;&s;els being quite clo&s;e contracted for near an inch or more from their extremity.</P>
<P>After this I made more experiments of the &s;ame kind upon brutes with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, and always found, upon di&s;&s;ection, the ends of the ve&s;&s;els clo&s;e contracted for a con&s;i|derable way: by removing my fingers from time to time, while I pre&s;&s;ed upon the ve&s;&s;el, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover this contraction taking place by a gradual decrea&s;e of the &s;tream of blood; but in Augu&s;t 1757 the following ca&s;e gave a further light to this matter.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<P>Jo&s;. Ayre of Caudwell, about twenty years of age, in being bled had the misfortune to have the humeral artery opened along with the ba&s;ilic vein, and the operator with much difficulty &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the haemorrhage by ban|dage: however a tumor with great pul&s;ation &s;oon began to ari&s;e in the part wounded, which in &s;ix or &s;even weeks increa&s;ed to the &s;ize of a pullet's egg.</P>
<P>The nature of the tumor was at once evi|dent, and an e&s;char on the upper part of it being upon the point of &s;eparation, deter|mined me to perform the operation for the aneuri&s;m.</P>
<P>The impul&s;e of the blood again&s;t the liga|ture at the time of the operation was very great; and as part of the artery (who&s;e dia|meter was con&s;iderably enlarged) was expo&s;ed, its pul&s;ation was remarkably vi&s;ible: but upon removing the dre&s;&s;ings the third day after|wards, the pul&s;ation could neither be &s;een nor felt nearer to the ligature than an inch and half; whence I was led to conclude, that the artery had collap&s;ed and gradually clo&s;ed it&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="12">up to the neare&s;t lateral branches, as the re|&s;i&s;tance towards the ligature abated from the blood pa&s;&s;ing through tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els.&mdash;And it appeared to me &s;elf-evident that nature always took this &s;tep to &s;uppre&s;s the haemorrhage from divided arteries, when I reflected that the &s;ame circum&s;tance con&s;tantly happens, when the umbilical ve&s;&s;els are divided at the birth of the foetus.</P>
<P>However, as I did not look for the lateral branches in the experiments mentioned, I cut off another hor&s;e's tail near his body, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the haemorrhage by pre&s;&s;ing a few mi|nutes with my fingers; and by a careful di&s;|&s;ection the next day after he was killed, I found that the conclu&s;ion I had drawn was (in this &s;ubject at lea&s;t) perfectly right.</P>
<P>Is it not owing to this cau&s;e that an hae|morrhage does not follow tho&s;e mortifications, where the greate&s;t part of the limb is de|&s;troyed and &s;eparates? For if the great ve&s;&s;els were clo&s;ed no farther than where the morti|fication ends, a flux of blood mu&s;t of cour&s;e en&s;ue upon the coming away of the dead
<PB N="7" REF="13">parts. Is not this evinced in a ca&s;e lately pub|li&s;hed by Mr. Antrobus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Med. Ob&s;erv. &amp; Inq. vol. ii. p. 152.</NOTE>? where, though the mortification &s;topped only two inches above the ancle, yet it is probable that the large arteries clo&s;ed them&s;elves as far at lea&s;t as where the femoral artery divides below the knee; becau&s;e neither pul&s;ation nor hae|morrhage appeared when the leg was taken off.</P>
<P>It will not, I imagine, appear at all &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that the clo&s;ing of the end of the ve&s;&s;el an inch only, or perhaps le&s;s, &s;hould be &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the force of the circulation, when it is con&s;idered, that this impul&s;e again&s;t the end of the artery immediately becomes le&s;s, and &s;oon intirely cea&s;es, from the blood upon meeting with re&s;i&s;tance dilating and pa&s;&s;ing through the neare&s;t lateral branches; as is fully evident from the gradual decrea&s;e, and at length the total di&s;appearance, of pul|&s;ation.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="14">
<P>Nor is this contraction of the artery and the alteration in the cour&s;e of the blood long in taking place, as appears from the experi|ments mentioned: and be&s;ides the&s;e, in many in&s;tances I have ob&s;erved, that arteries as large as tho&s;e we commonly meet with in cutting for the &s;tone, or in taking off &s;chir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ous brea&s;ts, &amp;c. will for the mo&s;t part, if they are wholly divided, be effectually clo&s;ed by pre&s;&s;ure in three or four minutes. And if in taking off a leg, we intercept the cour&s;e of the blood longer than is u&s;ually done, mo&s;t of the ar|teries will often be clo&s;ed, if the patient is in a tolerable good habit, as I have learnt by tying the large ve&s;&s;els without loo&s;ening the tourniquet.</P>
<P>I took off a woman's leg near the middle of her thigh, and tied the large artery with|out loo&s;ening the tourniquet; upon &s;etting it at liberty, we ob&s;erved &s;ome blood draining down the mu&s;cles from one artery only, and though it had contracted it&s;elf &s;o much as &s;carce to admit the pa&s;&s;age of any blood, yet by the pul&s;ation it appeared to be a very con|&s;iderable
<PB N="9" REF="15">ve&s;&s;el, and on this account the li|gature was u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Several more, which did not bleed, were di&s;covered by a &s;trong pul&s;ation at their ex|tremities; and therefore, in&s;tead of immedi|ately dre&s;&s;ing the patient, we waited ten or fifteen minutes, and gave her wine to rai&s;e her &s;pirits, &s;o that we might &s;ee whether they would bleed or not, and thereby prevent our being alarmed with a fre&s;h haemorrhage after &s;he was put to bed: but during this time the pul&s;ation gradually di&s;appeared, and the bleed|ing was effectually &s;topped.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ince I have attended to this cir|cum&s;tance I have &s;een it &s;o often happen, that I am well convinced in amputations larger ve&s;&s;els have been tru&s;ted with lint and flour than has generally been imagined; and that when a fre&s;h haemorrhage returns &s;ome hours after an operation, it is not from &s;mall arte|teries being dilated by an increa&s;ed motion in the blood, as has generally been thought, but to the principal lateral branches which had clo&s;ed them&s;elves being again forced open.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="16">
<P>That the large arteries are al&s;o clo&s;ed in a very little time, does not only appear from the experiment made upon the hor&s;e's leg, but likewi&s;e in &s;everal of tho&s;e ca&s;es where the cour&s;e of the blood was intercepted, either by the application of agaric or other fungous &s;ub|&s;tances, e&s;pecially a ca&s;e related by Mr. War|ner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;es, p. 147, 148.</NOTE>, where, <Q>"in an hour after the opera|tion, the mouths of the ve&s;&s;els were found totally contracted, &s;o as to re&s;i&s;t the whole force of the circulation;"</Q> after which they probably, like the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, &s;hrink into a perfect cord, and become impervious.&mdash; And does not nature &s;eem to point out, that intercepting the pa&s;&s;age of the blood for a while, is all that is required from art; as &s;ome animals by in&s;tinct, in &s;eparating their young from the placenta, lacerate the cord with their teeth, whence probably the ragged fibres &s;top up the end of the ve&s;&s;el by col|lap&s;ing over each other?</P>
<P>Seeing then that nature &s;uppre&s;&s;es the hae|morrhage from divided arteries by the natural
<PB N="11" REF="17">contraction of their circular fibres, when the impediment to this contraction is removed, by intercepting the impul&s;e of the blood, let us fairly enquire what method be&s;t an&s;wers this purpo&s;e, beginning with the ligature, on account of its having been long in general u&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="12" REF="18">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Ligature.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s which has hitherto in ge|neral attended the ligature, is a full proof of its efficacy; and it is evident no|thing can more powerfully intercept the cour&s;e of the blood, provided it can be properly ap|plied: and though it &s;eems to have been a general opinion, that the ve&s;&s;el only unites in that part where the &s;tricture is made, and preference has on that account been lately given to other remedies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;. Tran&s;. vol. xlvii. art. 94.</NOTE>; yet I imagine, from what has been &s;aid, it will readily be conceived that it is al&s;o in this ca&s;e clo&s;ed by its own natural contraction, and which will be found true, if the end of the artery can be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>But this is often difficult, it being at fir&s;t commonly covered with the &s;welled mu&s;cles,
<PB N="13" REF="19">and after &s;ome time &s;ends out (like all other parts) new fle&s;h, and cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed: therefore as a proof, I &s;hall ob&s;erve that the artery which was tied in the hor&s;e's leg, was net only clo&s;ed below, but al&s;o at lea&s;t half an inch above the ligature; &s;o that every ad|vantage po&s;&s;ible, in regard to &s;topping the blood, is obtained, provided the end of the ve&s;&s;el does not &s;eparate and come away with the ligature; for though no inconvenience will follow, if the &s;tricture is made &s;ome di&s;|tance from the lateral branches; yet, if it happens to be very near, a fre&s;h flux of blood mu&s;t en&s;ue, which is probably one rea&s;on why there are &s;ome few in&s;tances to be met with of the arteries bleeding again &s;ome time after they have been tied.</P>
<P>But, from attending &s;everal years to this particular, I find that the end of the ve&s;&s;el does not &s;o often come away as is imagined, and that a &s;eparation may be generally avoided, as it only happens when the ligature is thin, and very little &s;ub&s;tance is compri&s;ed along with the ve&s;&s;el in the noo&s;e; whereas when we take in a proper quantity of the circum|jacent
<PB N="14" REF="20">parts to defend it, and the ligature is of a proper &s;ize, upon dige&s;tion coming on it becomes loo&s;e and &s;lips off, leaving the ve&s;&s;el firmly clo&s;ed and intire.</P>
<P>However, that we may avoid with as much certainty as po&s;&s;ible the &s;eparation of the end of the ve&s;&s;el, I would advi&s;e that the ligature &s;hould be made of long twelve-penny flax, without either being the lea&s;t twi&s;ted or waxed further than ju&s;t the end, to make it pa&s;s thro' the eye of the needle; and if it is rubbed over with &s;ome &s;oft dige&s;tive, it will &s;lip ea|&s;ily through the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>This will be found &s;ufficiently &s;trong for the purpo&s;e for which it is wanted, without the lea&s;t danger of its injuring the ve&s;&s;el; nor need the compre&s;&s;ure be greater than is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to intercept the pa&s;&s;age of the blood, which will &s;till add to the &s;ecurity in this re|&s;pect, and at the &s;ame time produce other advantages, as will be ob&s;erved in their proper place.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="21">
<P>And further, if the ligature can be pro|perly applied, it is equally effectual, whether the artery be only in part or intirely divided; whether it is at liberty to retract it&s;elf, or ad|heres to an undivided mu&s;cle or the bone. And if the needle can be pa&s;&s;ed a proper depth into the adjacent parts, no accident can remove it, if they are &s;ound, till the &s;tate of contraction and inflammation is over; when, in general, all will have been done that is nece&s;&s;ary, the pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;welled mu&s;cles mo&s;t effectually a&s;&s;i&s;ting the clo&s;ing of the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, along with the&s;e advantages it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that great pain often ac|companies the u&s;e of the ligature; which, where it cannot be avoided, would make us prefer any other remedy that is equally &s;afe and un|attended with this inconvenience. But it very fortunately happens, that where the ligature is mo&s;t wanted, it may be applied with very little or no pain, if properly managed; for the large arteries are commonly &s;urrounded with a con&s;iderable quantity of cellular mem|brane;
<PB N="16" REF="22">and if we only take in with the ve&s;&s;el this nearly in&s;en&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance, the patient &s;eems undi&s;turbed during the operation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Monro, Ed. Med. E&s;&s;. vol. iv. p. 264.</NOTE>: and upon enquiring of &s;everal at the time of tying the ve&s;&s;el, whether they felt much pain, I have always been an&s;wered in the negative; and though the nerve which accompanies the artery is inclo&s;ed in the noo&s;e, it makes no difference in regard to this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e who have not con&s;idered this matter, that great pain &s;hould not ari&s;e upon a nerve, which is an organ of &s;en&s;ation, being compre&s;&s;ed; but there are &s;everal in&s;tances in the practice of &s;urgery, be&s;ides this, which lead us to ima|gine that the nerves are incapable of being irritated, till they are dive&s;ted of their cover|ings, unle&s;s you penetrate through their coats down to the medullary &s;ub&s;tance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In performing the operation upon an aneuri&s;m &s;ome time &s;ince, I accidentally had an opportunity of ob&s;erving the difference betwixt pricking and tying a nerve.
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing the needle under the artery it penetrated the nerve, upon which the patient in&s;tantly cried out of great pain all down his arm, which cea&s;ed when the needle was withdrawn. But though the &s;ame nerve was afterwards inclo&s;ed in the ligature along with the artery, the patient told me he only felt a prickling and numbne&s;s, which &s;oon went off.</P></NOTE> con&s;e|quently,
<PB N="17" REF="23">when they are al&s;o defended by the artery, fat, and cellular membrane, they will &s;till be le&s;s liable to be affected.</P>
<P>This may be illu&s;trated by reflecting on the &s;ituation of the nerves in the bones, tendons, membranes, and the like; where they &s;eem to be rendered in&s;en&s;ible and incapable of being irritated by the compactne&s;s of the parts which inve&s;t them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It does not hence follow, that <Q>"wounds of the ten|dons are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily cured of all others only by the help of nature, without any trouble or bad &s;ymptom,"</Q> as an author of eminence has a&s;&s;erted: and as it will ex|plain part of what is hereafter &s;aid about convul&s;ions, we &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that though the tendons in their natu|ral &s;tate are void of &s;en&s;ibility, yet, when they become &s;welled and ten&s;e, more painful and trouble&s;ome &s;ymp|toms generally ari&s;e in the&s;e than in other wounds; pro|bably from the particular &s;tructure of the part, by which the ob&s;truction ri&s;es higher and is long in terminating, and the nerves during this &s;tate are put more upon the &s;tretch than in any other part of the body. But this does not hold good when a tendon is much lacerated, or a large wound is made in any other tendi|nous part; for then they remain in&s;en&s;ible, and give no other di&s;turbance than from the length of time they take to &s;eparate; very likely from the ob&s;tructed fluids being freely di&s;charged, and the nerves being in a &s;tate of re|laxation.</NOTE>, as appears from
<PB N="18" REF="24">the new fle&s;h which follows their being wounded, being &s;en&s;ible, and again lo&s;ing its &s;en&s;ibility, as the part acquires its natural tex|ture.</P>
<P>With this we may ob&s;erve that numbne&s;s, the u&s;ual con&s;equence of compre&s;&s;ing a nerve, cannot here give any unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e the parts to which the nerves were di&s;tributed are removed.</P>
<P>However, when the ve&s;&s;els are &s;o &s;ituated that mu&s;cular fibres mu&s;t of cour&s;e be in|clo&s;ed, the ligature will unavoidably be at|tended with con&s;iderable pain; owing proba|bly to the nerves being dive&s;ted of their cover|ings, and their medullary &s;ub&s;tance alone ex|panded over every fibre of a mu&s;cle; not, I imagine, in the form of papillae, but in the
<PB N="19" REF="25">&s;ame manner, though much thinner, as the retina in the bottom of the eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I am not much mi&s;taken, in tracing the nerves through the mu&s;cles I have &s;een them become a perfect mucus in this manner; and whoever will compare, by the help of a proper gla&s;s, the medullary part of the brain or a nerve cut open, with mu&s;cular fibres, which are not dried by being expo&s;ed to the air, will find that they are covered with a kind of pulp that has exactly the &s;ame appearance. And does not an ob&s;ervation of Haller's (Sen&s;ib. &amp; Irritab. p. 59.) &s;eem to confirm this opinion; for in attempting to prove that irritability re&s;ides in the glutinous mucus, he &s;ays, <Q>"the mo&s;t irritable parts are deprived of that quality only by robbing them of this mucus by drying;"</Q> which is ea&s;ily explained, if in|&s;tead of mere gluten, this proves to be the medullary part of the nerve.
<P>Hence too we may ea&s;ily &s;ee, how every part of the body (except tho&s;e which are &s;ecured by a particular &s;tructure) is liable to be affected by the point of the fine&s;t needle. And how pain is carried by con&s;ent of parts all over the body, neither of which can be well ac|counted for, if the nerves are &s;uppo&s;ed to continue di&s;|tinct cords to their extremities.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But this pain is only momentary, becau&s;e whatever is inclo&s;ed becomes nearly in&s;en&s;ible upon the &s;tricture being made. If the liga|ture recommended is u&s;ed, the parts will be
<PB N="20" REF="26">le&s;s irritated; and whether the ab&s;olute &s;ecu|rity again&s;t a future haemorrhage does not fully compen&s;ate for the unea&s;ine&s;s the patient feels on this account, may be gathered from what follows.</P>
<P>But it is thought, <Q>"that the ligature, by compre&s;&s;ing the adjacent nerve, is &s;ome|times productive of convul&s;ions."</Q> Now as no facts are brought to &s;upport this opinion, and as I have never yet &s;een any accident of this kind happen, though I have always, without regarding the nerve, freely u&s;ed the needle and ligature; nor, upon &s;trict enquiry, found one in&s;tance of its happening among&s;t an exten&s;ive chirurgical acquaintance, I am induced to think with Mr. Sharp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crit. Inq. p. 291.</NOTE>, that the doctrine of convul&s;ions being cau&s;ed by the tying of a nerve is merely &s;peculative, and &s;eems, though the theory is changed, to have taken its ri&s;e from the arguments brought again&s;t Parey, when he fir&s;t introduced the practice of tying the arteries, and &s;ince to have been copied from one to another by &s;uc|ceeding writers.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="27">
<P>But is it not probable that in this in&s;tance, as well as many others in &s;urgery, by quite altering the meaning of the word NERVUS we have made tho&s;e &s;ymptoms follow the tying of a nerve, which &s;hould have been con&s;i|dered only as the con&s;equence of pricking a tendon? for long after Parey's time NERVUS was u&s;ed to &s;ignify TENDON, and by <Q>"ner|vo&s;am aliquam partem, vel nervum<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nam &s;i acu nervo&s;am aliquam partem, vel nervum ip&s;um pupugerit, dum ita novo &amp; inu&s;itato modo venam ab&s;urde conatur con&s;tringere, nova inflammatio nece&s;&s;ario con&s;equetur, &agrave; quo convul&s;io, &amp; &agrave; convul&s;ione cita mors.

<P>However, we will con&s;ider this matter in the light it now &s;tands; and for this purpo&s;e we may ob&s;erve, that the ligature &s;eems only
<PB N="22" REF="28">capable of irritating and of totally ob&s;tructing the nerves.</P>
<P>Now as the nerves upon the mu&s;cular fibres are very ea&s;ily irritated, a theory plau&s;ible enough may be invented to &s;hew, that in cer|tain habits convul&s;ions will come on upon their being tied; but then this would mo&s;t probably happen at the very time they were irritated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sharp's Crit. Inq. p. 292.</NOTE>: &s;o far from this, no one that I know of has even pretended to &s;ay, that he has &s;een any patient fall into convul&s;ions at the time the &s;tricture was made.

<P>On the other hand, if convul&s;ions aro&s;e in con&s;equence of the nerve being ob&s;tructed, in&s;tead of being a &s;ymptom that but very rarely happens, they would either in a greater or le&s;s degree appear almo&s;t every time a large one was tied; for if the&s;e are, as is generally believed, di&s;tinct cords from their origin, the ob&s;truction and its effects would be always nearly the &s;ame. But &s;o far from this, con|vul&s;ions of any kind are not more frequent where the large nerves are inclo&s;ed in the li|gature, than in &s;light injuries where it is not u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lately Le Dran<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Op.

<PB N="24" REF="30">the ligature, he &s;ays<NOTE N="&hDagger;" PLACE="foot">Loc. cit. p. 409.</NOTE>, <Q>"though by this me|thod they tie the nerve together with the artery, yet it is very &s;eldom any ill con&s;e|quences en&s;ue from thence, as the quantity of fle&s;h included by the ligature prevents the nerve from being much compre&s;&s;ed."</Q> And does not the &s;ame rea&s;oning hold good, as is already &s;hewn in amputations, where as great a quantity of the neighbouring parts is com|monly inclo&s;ed? Be&s;ides, when he tells us, <Q>"that tying the nerve along with the ve&s;&s;el, &s;ometimes brings on convul&s;ions &s;ome days after the ligature is made."</Q> He al&s;o in|forms us, <Q>"that there will not be any danger of this happening, if we apply a button of <HI>vitriol</HI> when the dre&s;&s;ings are fir&s;t re|moved;"</Q> which, he &s;ays, <Q>"gradually forms an e&s;char that includes the ligature, and renders it u&s;ele&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Now in a few days the ligature becomes loo&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and is no longer capable of doing injury. The parts being now in|flamed and more &s;en&s;ible, <HI>vitriol</HI> will act with
<PB N="25" REF="31">great violence upon the nerves; &s;o that if no ill effects aro&s;e from this complicated treat|ment, much le&s;s could they ari&s;e from the li|gature alone.</P>
<P>If the convul&s;ions then were not the con|&s;equence of the dying &s;tate of the patient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sharp's Crit.

<P>From the whole then of what has been &s;aid, there is rea&s;on to acquit the ligature of
<PB N="27" REF="33">being productive of tho&s;e convul&s;ions which &s;ometimes have happened to attend a wound wherein it has been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another kind of &s;pa&s;ms, that are partial and attended with pain, are &s;aid con&s;tantly to attend the u&s;e of the needle and ligature; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that while the needle is piercing a mu&s;cle a &s;pa&s;m is often produced: but it may with equal truth be ob&s;erved, that it immediately cea&s;es when the parts inclo&s;ed are numbed with the ligature. And it &s;eems more likely that tho&s;e &s;pa&s;ms, which conti|nue more or le&s;s for &s;ome time after the ope|ration, ari&s;e from the nerves being irritated by the knife, by the air, and by the dre&s;&s;|ings; for whoever attends to this circum|&s;tance will find, that the &s;pa&s;ms which fol|low, for in&s;tance, an amputation of the leg, immediately &s;eize the mu&s;cles upon their be|ing divided before any needle can be u&s;ed. And we know by experience they will con|tinue &s;ome time after the irritating cau&s;e is removed, in proportion as the nerves were more or le&s;s affected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Whytt on vital and invol.

<PB N="28" REF="34">will be produced by the other cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned, there is rea&s;on to conclude from ob&s;erving, that even the mu&s;cles of animals, immedi|ately after death, are thrown into &s;pa&s;ms by being expo&s;ed to the cold air; and &s;pa&s;ms are al&s;o often brought on by touching naked wounds with dry lint.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;pa&s;ms follow tho&s;e amputations ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, where the ve&s;&s;els are not tied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. vol. xlviii. part 2. p. 591.</NOTE>; nor can the ab&s;ence of this &s;ymptom with ju&s;tice be a&s;cribed to the omi&s;|&s;ion of the ligature in amputations of the brea&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 596.</NOTE>, becau&s;e in this ca&s;e the mu&s;cles, which are the &s;eat of &s;pa&s;ms, are &s;eldom touched with the needle; the cellular and adipo&s;e membrane only being taken in with the ve&s;&s;el, and which, from their &s;mall de|gree of &s;en&s;ibility, give but little unea&s;ine&s;s: and out of many in&s;tances I do not remember any patient attended with <HI>trouble&s;ome</HI> &s;pa&s;ms after this operation, though the needle and ligature were always u&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="35">
<P>Another objection to the ligature is, <Q>"that it increa&s;es the &s;ymptomatic fever, becau&s;e its application gives violent pain:"</Q> but though it often gives &s;mart pain for an in|&s;tant, it does not follow that it aggravates the &s;ymptomatic fever, for the pain is only mo|mentary, and whatever is included in the li|gature immediately becomes &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, as to give no future di&s;turbance. It is true, an inflammation will take place above the &s;tric|ture; but as an inflammation of equal degree would probably have occurred, though the ligature was not u&s;ed, very little difference of pain can ari&s;e from this cau&s;e, as is evinced by the &s;ymptoms following an operation be|ing much the &s;ame, whether we u&s;e many ligatures or few.</P>
<P>But the &s;ymptomatic fever &s;eems not to ari&s;e from the pain which accompanies or im|mediately follows any part of the operation, but to the di&s;ten&s;ion which is cau&s;ed by the ob&s;truction and inflammation that comes on &s;ome time after in con&s;equence of the divi&s;ion of the parts; for that pain which ari&s;es from the nerves being irritated and di&s;ordered in
<PB N="30" REF="36">the operation, pre&s;ently goes off, the irritating cau&s;e being in&s;tantly removed. And does not the &s;ymptomatic fever gradually come on, a few hours after the operation, as the parts about the wound begin to &s;well, and again decline as the di&s;ten&s;ion abates, from the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els freely tran&s;mitting their con|tents?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, from the account given us of the &s;ymptomatic fever following an amputation of the leg, where the ligature was omitted, we &s;ee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. vol. xlviii. part 2. p. 591. or Mr. Warner's Ca&s;es, ca&s;e 29.</NOTE> it came on about the u&s;ual time, and &s;eems to have been nearly the &s;ame as when it is u&s;ed. And though the symptomatic fe|ver has been &s;light in amputations of the brea&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, where the ve&s;&s;els were not tied, yet it does not appear to be a proof that it is increa&s;ed by the u&s;e of the ligature, becau&s;e in this operation the &s;ymptomatic fever is for the mo&s;t part, if not always, &s;light; for the fat in the cellular membrane ea&s;ily melts down, and the reticular or membranous part
<PB N="31" REF="37">&s;ends out new fle&s;h without giving much di&s;|turbance, and in this ca&s;e the&s;e, with the &s;kin, are the only parts wounded; for even when a &s;chirrus adheres, it is &s;eparated from the pectoral mu&s;cle without doing much in|jury, as this operation, I imagine, is never practi&s;ed when the adhe&s;ion is otherwi&s;e than &s;light.</P>
<P>With this we &s;hould remember, that the &s;ymptomatic fever is always &s;light where the &s;olids are relaxed and weak, in con&s;equence of the &s;mall degree of force with which the blood is carried again&s;t the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els. And is it not therefore more likely owing to this cau&s;e than to the omi&s;&s;ion of the liga|ture, that a &s;light fever only followed in tho&s;e who&s;e legs were amputated by Mr. Warner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Loc. cit.</NOTE>, as all the&s;e patients were much reduced pre|vious to the operation? And is not, in &s;uch habits, the &s;ymptomatic fever con&s;tantly &s;light, though the ligature is u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid that ab&s;ce&s;&s;es are the con&s;e|quence of u&s;ing the ligature, and that it &s;ome|times
<PB N="32" REF="38">remains fixed to the la&s;t, &s;o as to retard the healing of the wound; but the&s;e incon|veniencies only happen when the needle is pa&s;&s;ed very deep, and may therefore be avoid|ed by a contrary practice: nor is pa&s;&s;ing the needle deep at all nece&s;&s;ary (if the parts are &s;ound) as a &s;mall quantity of fle&s;h or cellular membrane below the &s;tricture will &s;ufficiently prevent the ligature being pu&s;hed off by the impul&s;e of the blood. However I would cau|tion again&s;t extremes; for with pa&s;&s;ing the needle but a very little way the ve&s;&s;el &s;ome|times may not be tied, and cau&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary trouble; if we therefore pa&s;s the needle only a moderate depth, the ligature will always come away in due time without inconveni|ence, or at lea&s;t it may be taken away long before the wound is healed, without any dan|ger of bringing on a fre&s;h haemorrhage: for as &s;oon as dige&s;tion is complete, and the new fle&s;h begins to ri&s;e, the ligature makes not any pre&s;&s;ure upon the ve&s;&s;el; and though new fle&s;h may have covered the noo&s;e, yet if we take the advice long &s;ince given by Monro<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ed.

<PB N="33" REF="39">it may be removed without any hazard of cutting the artery.</P>
<P>This is the light in which I have been led to con&s;ider the u&s;e and abu&s;e of the needle and ligature in tying the blood ve&s;&s;els, and &s;hall now proceed to enquire into the method of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the haemorrhage by fungous &s;ub&s;tances; which, like the ligature, will ap|pear to have their advantage and inconve|nience.</P>

<P>THE late &s;ucce&s;s which has attended the application of fungous &s;ub&s;tances is a full proof that an haemorrhage from large ar|teries may often be effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by their u&s;e; and it at the &s;ame time points out the truth of the doctrine advanced, and what little a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this ca&s;e is wanting.</P>
<P>But the manner of applying fungu&s;es makes a material difference in regard to &s;ucce&s;s; for if they are pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e again&s;t the end of the ve&s;&s;el, they intercept the pa&s;&s;age of the blood; and the artery clo&s;es it&s;elf up in the manner de&s;cribed: whereas, when this circum&s;tance is not ob&s;erved, and they are only laid near to the orifice, in the manner Che&s;elden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil.

<P>This is evident from the experiments made by La Fo&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;. Tran&s;. vol. xlix. part. art. 10 &amp; 11.</NOTE>, where the coagulated blood, which filled the end of the artery, was formed into a cone with its apex towards the heart; con&s;equently, if the plug happens to extend to the next collateral branch, a fre&s;h flux of blood mu&s;t en&s;ue upon its coming away; for it does not unite with the ve&s;&s;el, as &s;ome have imagined.</P>
<P>I know there are in&s;tances, where an ori|fice made in an artery has been &s;topped with a clot of &s;olid blood, which adhering firmly to the cicatrix of the integuments, produced a con&s;iderable callo&s;ity, and which &s;eems to have given ri&s;e to this opinion.

<PB N="36" REF="44" MS="y">without coming to &s;uppuration; whereas when the air has free acce&s;s, we well know a putrefaction of the coagulated blood, as well as dige&s;tion, is always the con&s;equence; and I make no doubt but the &s;eparation of coa|gulated blood is one cau&s;e why a fre&s;h bleed|ing has &s;ometimes come on after the inflam|mation was abated, and matter began to be freely di&s;charged. In a very late in&s;tance, where the bleeding from a divided artery had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by coagulated blood, I &s;aw it renewed again next day by taking this blood away; the artery bleeding in the &s;ame manner as when it was fir&s;t opened; but upon pre&s;&s;ing it betwixt my fingers it was &s;oon effectually clo&s;ed. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that the prac|tice of laying allum, or any thing el&s;e, at the end of the artery to coagulate the blood, is very improper, as every impediment to the contraction of the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould on the con|trary be removed.</P>
<P>This leads me to take notice of Petit's opi|nion, who imagined that the haemorrhage from divided arteries was always &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by plugs of blood within the ve&s;&s;el; becau&s;e

<P>But notwith&s;tanding this, it is very proba|ble that the haemorrhage was &s;topped by the natural contraction of the ve&s;&s;el; for we find in the two waggoners mentioned by Mon&s;.

<P>Pouteau<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Melanges des Chirurg. p. 314.</NOTE> opened &s;everal arteries, and ne|ver found any coagulum; nor is there any

<P>It follows then, that whatever fungus is u&s;ed, it &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to the end of the ve&s;&s;el; and that kind which adheres clo|&s;e&s;t &s;hould be cho&s;en. Mr. White &s;ays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Loc. cit.</NOTE> that &s;punge is on this account preferable; and if
<PB N="39" REF="50">his directions, in regard to the choice, pre|paration, and manner of applying it, be ob|&s;erved, I believe he &s;ays true; but even this &s;ticks the fa&s;te&s;t when it is lea&s;t wanted; for though after a while it adheres &s;o firm, that it is removed with difficulty, yet, till the parts begin to &s;well and become moi&s;t, the adhe|&s;ion is very &s;light.</P>
<P>Bandage therefore mu&s;t be carefully applied to pre&s;erve it in its proper &s;ituation; and if this circum&s;tance had been duly attended to, in&s;tead of relying upon a &s;pecific property in agaric, better &s;ucce&s;s would probably have at|tended it when in vogue; for where agaric it&s;elf proved ineffectual, tight bandage and common dre&s;&s;ings &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the haemorrhage. And we might produce innumerable in&s;tances which prove, that whatever is kept firm upon the end of the ve&s;&s;el is &s;ufficient for the pur|po&s;e. &mdash;However, if what is &s;aid about tying the great arteries be true, mo&s;t &s;urgeons, I imagine, will &s;till &s;ecure them with the liga|ture; for no &s;ort of bandage can with &s;afety in amputations be &s;o applied, but the fungus may &s;ometimes be di&s;placed by &s;pa&s;ms, cough|ing,

<P>But &s;uppo&s;e our a&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;hould be &s;o lucky as to compre&s;s the tourniquet time enough to &s;ave the patient's life, yet it is probable a quantity of blood will often be lo&s;t, that may be injurious to him; for though the lo&s;s of &s;ome blood from this accident may be &s;er|viceable, when the patient is not much re|duced
<PB N="41" REF="52">by the di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Warner's Ca&s;es, ca&s;e 44.</NOTE>; on the other hand, the lo&s;s of a few ounces, when he is become weak, will be very improper, and very likely retard the recovery of his health: and we may ob&s;erve, even in &s;trong habits, that the di&s;charge of blood ought not to be commit|ted to chance, but intirely directed by the judgment of the &s;urgeon. And though it &s;hould happen that very little blood is lo&s;t, the patient may not only undergo great pain from the compre&s;&s;ure, till the &s;urgeon can be called, perhaps from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, but the parts may be much injured by the fluids being &s;o long in a &s;tate of &s;tagnation.</P>
<P>But this inconvenience will for the mo&s;t part attend the u&s;e of this remedy in ampu|tation of the limbs; for all agree that it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the limb compre&s;&s;ed a con|&s;iderable time with the tourniquet, and which will al&s;o in all probability overbalance the pain cau&s;ed in u&s;ing the needle and ligature.

<PB N="42" REF="53">in de&s;cribing tho&s;e ca&s;es, where we are told, though the tourniquet was kept compre&s;&s;ed for half an hour, that the pa|tient was remarkably ea&s;y during that time.

<P>This rea&s;oning al&s;o holds good in regard to the le&s;&s;er arteries, when they are &s;urrounded with the cellular or adipo&s;e membrane only; though it cannot be extended to the tying of tho&s;e which are &s;ituated among&s;t the mu&s;cles, becau&s;e, as is already ob&s;erved, the ligature is here attended with con&s;iderable pain; nor is the tourniquet in this ca&s;e wanted; and I make no doubt, but the&s;e ve&s;&s;els may in ge|neral
<PB N="43" REF="54">be tru&s;ted with &s;punge, or any thing el&s;e that adheres clo&s;e to their extremities: but the &s;punge &s;hould be removed the fir&s;t or &s;econd dre&s;&s;ing, otherwi&s;e the new fle&s;h grow|ing into its pores will cau&s;e an increa&s;e of pain in the removal.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the bleeding &s;hould happen to return, though on account of the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;els it might not be dangerous, yet even here more blood might be di&s;charged than it would be prudent to lo&s;e; a fre&s;h hae|morrhage is always alarming to the patient; and as momentary pain &s;eems to be the only inconvenience, perhaps many &s;urgeons will think it be&s;t to leave their patients in perfect &s;ecurity: and we may ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that in many operations the ligature mu&s;t of cour&s;e be u&s;ed upon all the ve&s;&s;els, as it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;top the bleeding as we go on.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, when the fle&s;h is become ten|der, and gives way to the ligature, &s;punge &s;eems to be the be&s;t remedy; for though the large ve&s;&s;els might be pulled out, and tied in
<PB N="44" REF="55">the manner Dionis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He de&s;cribes different methods, but that is here re|ferred to, where the thread is pa&s;&s;ed through the end of the ve&s;&s;el to prevent its being pu&s;hed off by the impul&s;e of the blood. See chap. on Amputation.</NOTE> de&s;cribes, yet, being un|defended, the end would commonly &s;eparate; and unle&s;s the ligature was placed near its ex|tremity, &s;ometimes bring on a fre&s;h haemor|rhage in the manner already ob&s;erved. And this was mo&s;t probably the rea&s;on why Parey had more certain &s;ucce&s;s, when he took in, along with the ve&s;&s;el, &s;ome of the adjacent parts, than when he inclo&s;ed it alone in the ligature.</P>
<P>Where the ve&s;&s;els are &s;o deeply &s;ituated as not to be come at with the needle, the &s;ame kind of application mu&s;t have preference, if it can be laid clo&s;e to the mouth of the ar|tery; and it &s;ucceeds better in this ca&s;e, as the &s;ides of the wound a&s;&s;i&s;t in keeping it in its proper &s;ituation: but before it is applied, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to examine whether the ar|tery is wholly divided; for without this cau|tion we may &s;ometimes be di&s;appointed in our expectation, and a&s;cribe in&s;ufficiency to
<PB N="45" REF="56">this method, as was done to the agaric<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Neal on Agaric, p. 35.</NOTE>, when the want of &s;ucce&s;s was owing to the ve&s;&s;el being in part divided, whence it was incapable of intercepting the pa&s;&s;age of the blood. Nor &s;hould we forget, that in wounds which admit of cure by an immediate union of their divided parts, fungous &s;ub&s;tances are unnece&s;&s;ary, as the common method of dre&s;&s;|ing effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;es the bleeding, though it is from con&s;iderable arteries.</P>
<P>However, if the artery is large, and any difficulty occurs, if the part will admit of the practice of dilating the wound, perhaps it may &s;eem more proper by that means to u&s;e the ligature, e&s;pecially if it adheres to an un|divided mu&s;cle or the bone, and bandage can|not be conveniently applied; and where the principal trunk of a large artery is wounded in a longitudinal direction, Mr. Lambert's<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Med. Inq. vol. ii. p. 360.</NOTE> method of &s;ewing it up &s;hould, I think, be tried.</P>

In this ca&s;e, with tight bandage it has an|&s;wered my purpo&s;e, till internal medicines had their proper effect: and if upon trial it &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful under the like circum|&s;tances, will it not be more proper than <HI>&s;typ|tics</HI> or <HI>a&s;tringents,</HI> &amp;c. as the&s;e harden the fi|bres, and prevent dige&s;tion, from which in|convenience this remedy is free?

Med. E&s;&s;. vol. iv. p. 271.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome will think that &s;typtics and a&s;tringents will forward the contraction of the ve&s;&s;els: but we may learn how little they
<PB N="47" REF="58">are wanted, from the artery in the young fel|low's arm, which was evidently relaxed and weak, clo&s;ing it&s;elf without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and I am per&s;uaded, from &s;ome experiments I have made, that the&s;e applications, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, would, if they were not hindered by mixing with the blood in wounds, rather prevent the collap&s;ing of the ve&s;&s;el by hard|ing its fibres. And however contrary this doc|trine may be to the generally received opi|nion, experience is certainly in its favour; for though by coagulating the blood, they might &s;ucceed upon very &s;mall arteries, yet, being applied to tho&s;e which were large, they were always found in&s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s the bleeding, unle&s;s tight bandage was at the &s;ame time u&s;ed, and to which I think it is clear the &s;ucce&s;s was owing: for many of the&s;e com|po&s;itions, which were thought to be a&s;trin|gents, had certainly no other property as blood-&s;taunchers than that of choaking up the mouths of the ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Parey, p. 328.

<PB N="48" REF="59">
<P>It is obvious that the fungus, when u&s;ed, mu&s;t be kept in its proper &s;ituation by ban|dage differently applied, according to the part wounded; and in this matter every &s;urgeon's own judgment will be&s;t direct him. How|ever we may ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that in amputations good &s;licking plai&s;ter, as advi&s;ed by Mr. White<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Spunge.</NOTE>, and keeping the hand pre&s;&s;ed harder again&s;t the part for a few hours, may often be &s;uffcient; though the machine recom|mended by Mr. Gooch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;es, p. 131 and 141.</NOTE> will, probably, be more certain; and when this is not at hand, a circular piece of leather may be made to an&s;wer nearly the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This piece of leather mu&s;t be large enough to cover the end of the &s;tump, and near its edge mu&s;t be cut four &s;lits in oppo&s;ite direc|tions, that will admit each a fillet.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing a leg taken off below the knee, two fillets be|ing pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e &s;lits cro&s;&s;ways, and under a roller or a piece of cloth that goes round the thigh, above the knee, mu&s;t be
<PB N="49" REF="60">brought back again, and tied upon the end of the &s;tump, by which means the dre&s;&s;ings will be fixed, and any degree of pre&s;&s;ure may be made: and this bandage, if it is kept from &s;lipping down, by being fa&s;tened with filleting to a roller round the wai&s;t, &s;erves equally well when we amputate above the knee. Nor do I recommend this method without experience; for having amputated a leg, where the blood was extremely poor, and the fle&s;h very tender, the ligatures were forced off the ve&s;&s;els a few hours after the operation, by a fit of cough|ing and vomiting; I immediately applied the bandage above-mentioned, with bol&s;ters of dry lint, which effectually an&s;wered the pur|po&s;e: for, though the patient vomited and coughed &s;everal times afterwards, the haemor|rhage did not return.</P>
<P>Indeed bandage &s;eems hitherto to have proved le&s;s &s;erviceable than it might have been, merely from imagining it would be u&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els were brought together in clo&s;e contact; whereas, had the pre&s;&s;ure been made only upon the end of the ve&s;&s;el, and ju&s;t &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t; the im|pul&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="61">of the blood, it might much oftener have been u&s;ed without inconvenience, and with better &s;ucce&s;s, as there is rea&s;on to think from many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>We have only further to add on this head, that where the wounded artery cannot be come at, pre&s;&s;ure is &s;till the only remedy; and where things are &s;o circum&s;tanced that we are obliged to choak up the mouths of the ve&s;&s;els with coagulated blood, it &s;eems nece&s;|&s;ary, for rea&s;ons already given, to make a pre&s;&s;ure, if it can be done, again&s;t the end of the artery, that the contraction beyond the plug may more certainly take place.</P>

<P>BESIDES the methods above-mentioned, Mr. Warner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;es, p. 38.</NOTE> has &s;hewn, that when an artery is opened in the roof of the mouth, the actual cautery is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the bleeding: and many years ago, after ex|tirpating a tumor from this part, I was obliged, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame remedy; but the iron was no hotter than ju&s;t &s;ufficient to form the neighbouring parts into an e&s;char upon the end of the artery; by which means the cour&s;e of the blood was in|tercepted, and the ve&s;&s;el left at liberty to clo&s;e it&s;elf up; whereas when the cautery is very hot, it not only burns the end of the artery a con&s;iderable way, but hardening its fibres beyond the e&s;char, renders it incapable of col|lap&s;ing; &s;o that it is no wonder an haemor|rhage
<PB N="52" REF="64">&s;hould &s;o often en&s;ue upon the &s;epira|tion of the dead parts.</P>
<P>However, the cautery is at all times a cruel application, and &s;hould be avoided, if po&s;&s;i|ble: nor do I now call to mind any other part where its u&s;e can be wanted. But if this is cruel, the potential cautery is more &s;o, as it &s;preads it&s;elf further into the neighbouring parts; and yet it is not very uncommon for &s;urgeons in performing operations to apply lint &s;oaked in &s;calding oil of turpentine, where the artery, though not very large, cannot be readily come at: and this piece of cruelty is &s;till aggravated, when we con&s;ider that a few minutes pre&s;&s;ure would, in all probability, have alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">en &s;uffcient for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Cau&s;tics, &amp;c. are, I believe, in general, laid a&s;ide in &s;upper&s;&s;ing haemorrhages; and therefore we need only ob&s;erve, that, though they do not, by hardening the &s;ides of the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ery, render it incapable of collap&s;ing above the part de&s;troyed, yet, by cau&s;ing its end to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters">rary to right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> advi&s;e ill,
