<HEAD>A REMARKABLE CASE OF MADNESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE records of medicine cannot perhaps afford an in&s;tance &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, nor do we find in the different writers, who have profe&s;&s;edly treated on <HI>maniacal</HI> affections, one ca&s;e wherein, at &s;o early a period as the age of <HI>eleven years,</HI> the di&s;order has appeared with marks &s;o clear and intelligible. And it is as &s;ingular in this in&s;tance that
<PB N="6" REF="4">there &s;eems no clue leading to the cau&s;e, as predi&s;po&s;ing to in&s;anity, no <HI>tran&s;lation</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;ed matter of any part to the membranes of the brain producing <HI>delirium</HI> &amp;c, nor <HI>diffu&s;ion</HI> of bile, &s;ud|den &s;ub&s;idence of <HI>cutaneous eruptions, ab&s;ortion</HI> of matter from <HI>ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, wounds,</HI> or <HI>ulcers,</HI> no <HI>&s;crophulous</HI> or <HI>cancerous</HI> taint of the juices, no exhibi|tion of <HI>deleterious</HI> vegetables or <HI>mercurial</HI> preparations, no <HI>&s;udden fright, acci|dental blow, fall,</HI> or any <HI>hereditary</HI> predi&s;po&s;ition to <HI>mania.</HI> No one of his family on the &s;ide of either father or mother having ever been remembered to have been the lea&s;t affected with mental di&s;ea&s;e; in &s;hort there was no obvious cau&s;e to which the complaint could be rationally a&s;&s;igned. The child
<PB N="7" REF="5">was looked upon as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no ex|traordinary &s;hare of genius, ability, nor activity of imagination, nor was he &s;o &s;prightly as mo&s;t boys of that age, but rather of a thoughtful, melancholic di&s;po&s;ition, very little inclined to pue|rile amu&s;ements and diver&s;ions; but rather docile and tractable, he had al|ways been healthy, had never &s;hewn a wanton propen&s;ity to hard and indegi&s;ti|ble aliment, he had never been too much indulged, nor compelled to any inten&s;e application of mind. It was his cu&s;tom in the morning to go with other children to a &s;chool at &s;ome di&s;tance from his home, and to return in the evening. <HI>On the twenty ninth of January,</HI> 1789, he return|ed unu&s;ually low and dull, little notice was then taken of the alteration in his
<PB N="8" REF="6">appearance; but upon his return from &s;chool the following day, the depre&s;&s;ion and lowne&s;s being much more vi&s;ible, a &s;erious enquiry took place, as to the cau&s;e of his complaint, but his an&s;wers &s;eemed rather extorted, were vague, unconnected, and inconclu&s;ive he &s;eem|ed hurried at the &s;ight of &s;trangers, often turned pale, trembled, had an angry acute &s;taring look, with dilated pupils, and dreadful apprehen&s;ions, frequently look|ed fearfully about, as if he &s;u&s;pected &s;ome ill de&s;ign, &s;ometimes he appeared timid and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed much, and had not more than a quarter of an hours &s;leep throughout the whole night. <HI>January</HI> 31&s;t, from a &s;uppo&s;ition of co&s;tivene&s;s, &s;ome manna was di&s;&s;olved and given him, which operated once, but did not
<PB N="9" REF="7">relieve him in the lea&s;t, he appeared all the day unu&s;ually &s;trange in his manner and actions. Fear, di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;hame, alternately occupied his mind but he did not at any time advert to any one object in particular, nor upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination could it be found that he had been lately terrified, or undergone the lea&s;t degree of &s;chola&s;tic admoni|tory di&s;cipline, or that his temper had been ruffled in any &s;hape whatever. He was &s;at up with, had very little &s;leep, not more than two hours in the whole night. <HI>In the morning, February</HI> 1&s;t, he &s;poke rather more rationally than he had done before, but complained of a pain in his head with giddine&s;s, weakne&s;s, and rather a dimne&s;s of fight, that his eyes ached and were painful, and that
<PB N="10" REF="8">he &s;carcely knew where he was, and &s;aid he was very &s;leepy; he laid down to &s;leep, but was &s;o re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in mind, as not to get any, and if a word were &s;poken, it made him peevi&s;h, and petulant, and the lea&s;t motion from the bye &s;tanders became an immediate object of fre&s;h inquietude and vexation. Having &s;ome degree of rigor, and his legs and feet feeling very cold, by the directions of his mother, they were very judiciou&s;ly immer&s;ed in warm water, and he was put to bed again, when the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;sful ideas occa&s;ioned the &s;ame watchfulne&s;s as before, and he &s;lept not &s;o much as an hour in the whole night, often waking in great perturbation of mind, &s;ometimes &s;ighing, as if he la|boured under great affliction and at in|tervals
<PB N="11" REF="9" MS="y">ince&s;&s;antly talking and rambling with quick tran&s;ition from one &s;ubject to another, without the lea&s;t rea&s;on or coherence whatever. <HI>February</HI> 2d, the family apothecary was &s;ent for, who found him in the &s;tate as before de&s;cribe|ed with an alienation of mind without a fever; the &s;kin har&s;h and dry, he had had little or no per&s;piration from the time he was taken, &s;ometimes very wakeful and loquacious, at others &s;tupid, ab&s;ent, and mu&s;ing, and the pul&s;e rather below the natural &s;tandard at his age; &s;inapi&s;ms were ordered to the feet, and a bli&s;ter to the back, which were applied in the evening; he pa&s;&s;ed the night in a more unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s manner than before, and in the morning, at the particular reque&s;t of the apothe|cary,

<PB N="12" REF="12">another practitioner was con&s;ulted. <HI>February</HI> 3d, his &s;leep during the night had been le&s;s di&s;turbed, but of very &s;hort duration, at mo&s;t not more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time, and in the intervals frequently interrupted with &s;ighs and &s;tartings. <HI>February</HI> 4th, all the former &s;igns of mental derange|ment recurred, and there appeared not the lea&s;t alteration for the better, the bli&s;ter had di&s;charged but little, and he having been co&s;tive, for &s;ome time, four &s;timulant cly&s;ters were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively injected; but returned again, ju&s;t tinged with the feces, and without any apparent good effect. <HI>Until February</HI> 18th, he continued alternately in a &s;ilent &s;tupid or di&s;tre&s;sfully ob&s;treperous &s;late; but at intervals began to &s;hew &s;ome &s;igns of
<PB N="13" REF="13">returning rea&s;on, which continued to furni&s;h hopes of recovery, until <HI>Febru|ary</HI> 14th, when he reverted entirely in|to his former bad &s;tate, had a mi&s;erably di&s;tre&s;&s;ing night, with the aggravated &s;ymptoms of di&s;torted eyes, and oppre&s;|&s;ed re&s;piration; neither was he in the lea&s;t better all that Day nor the following night; the bli&s;ter at his back di&s;charged tolerably well, was kept open, and an i&s;&s;ue was al&s;o opened in his arm. <HI>February</HI> 15th, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> he took <HI>emetics</HI> twice, which had no manner of effect either upwards or downwards; <HI>bolu&s;&s;es of cam|phor</HI> were pre&s;cribed and given; but &s;till he remained in a gloomy and per|turbed &s;tate of mind without any &s;ever until <HI>February</HI> 19th, when becoming much wor&s;e in every re&s;pect, and by
<PB N="14" REF="14">way of revul&s;ion, it was thought nece&s;|&s;ary to apply bli&s;ters to the legs, which was done, and a very bad night en&s;ued; for it was with much difficulty he was kept in bed; be&s;ides the ordinary &s;ymptoms of melancholy, he was at times more ira&s;cible and furious than at any former period of his illne&s;s. <HI>February</HI> 20th, all day he appeared to labour under the mo&s;t excruciating and inten&s;e &s;en&s;ations of anxiety and an|gui&s;h, and pa&s;&s;ed a dreadful night. <HI>February</HI> 21&s;t. the &s;ame &s;ymptoms con|tinued without the lea&s;t mitigation, un|til toward the morning, when a &s;ullen &s;ilence and re&s;erve, accompanied with &s;ome degree of &s;leep &s;upervened, relax|ing from which, for &s;ome hours, he appeared rational, and more calm and
<PB N="15" REF="15">compo&s;ed than he had been for &s;ome time before; but this was an interval of &s;hort duration, for <HI>February</HI> 22d. he grew much wor&s;e, with cold &s;hudder|ing, great difficulty of breathing, was furious, and became quite raving, &s;o that two &s;trong people could not hold him, down in his bed, without much exertion, and in this &s;tate, with very little variation, he continued until <HI>February</HI> 27th. when &s;oon after &s;ome loo&s;e feces, procured by a laxative medicine, he &s;uddenly became more ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed more water than he had done for &s;everal days be|fore, &s;lept with much le&s;s interruption, &s;eemed to be more rational, and in &s;ome degree, recoverd his u&s;ual &s;pi|rits, but <HI>February</HI> 28th. he reverted to
<PB N="16" REF="16">his former &s;tate of horror and dejection, and &s;eemed &s;carcely to know or attend at all to external objects. <HI>March</HI> 1&s;t. he was apparently le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and agi|tated in his mind. <HI>March</HI> 2d, produced &s;ome comfortable hopes that he was getting better, which in &s;ome degree alleviated the painful feelings of maternal affection, that had &s;o long been upon the rack on account of his &s;ufferings; but this ce&s;&s;ation of parental &s;olicitude, was only protracted until <HI>March</HI> 7th, when he again appeared low and &s;ad, and much deranged in mind, and com|plained of a pain and weight in his head, which was directed to be &s;haved and embrocated with di&s;tilled vinegar, and a bli&s;ter to the head was al&s;o advi&s;ed as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary; but the idea of its
<PB N="17" REF="17">application was &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to his friends, as to preclude for the pre&s;ent all thoughts of it; another <HI>emetic</HI> much &s;tronger than either of the former was next thought of and admini&s;tered accordingly; but prov|ed as inefficacious in its operation as ei|ther of the preceding, neither occa&s;ioning nau&s;ea, vomiting, or purging; but &s;ome &s;mall degree of dampne&s;s on the &s;kin was thought to be in con&s;equence of it. Hitherto every medical effort had pro|ved fruitle&s;s, and the poor little &s;ufferer obtained no palliation of the &s;ymptoms. <HI>March</HI> 9th. Still a victim to the ravages and returns of this mercile&s;s malady, he was &s;eized with di&s;mal apprehen|&s;ions, and groundle&s;s fears. The facul|ties of his mind were weak and timid. Taciturnity and meditation took place
<PB N="18" REF="18">of horror and depre&s;&s;ion, tears and lamentations, which recurred and re|mitted in proportion as his ruminating paroxy&s;ms were longer or &s;horter, his nights were pa&s;&s;ed in watchfulne&s;s, and his days in &s;adne&s;s, with lucid intervals of momentary duration, until <HI>March</HI> 13th, when the &s;olitary &s;tate of his mind changed, on a &s;udden, into di&s;traction audacity and violence,; the dilirium appearing to have taken a turn directly oppo&s;ite to its former genus, &s;o that from the de&s;ponding, he was now be|come the raving maniac, and the &s;itua|tion of him&s;elf and friends was rendered truly deplorable indeed. At this cri&s;is of calamity a <HI>bli&s;ter to the head</HI> was again propo&s;ed, and the former objections giving way to the emergency of the ca&s;e,
<PB N="19" REF="19">was applied, when the next day he was infinitely wor&s;e, and more re&s;tle&s;s and unmanagable than he had ever been before. The cau&s;ticity of the bli&s;ter occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t violent excitement, and thereby counterbalanced every benefit which might have ari&s;en from its di&s;charge, and indeed in a very long and exten&s;ive practice I never re|member to have &s;een more than <HI>two</HI> in&s;tances of the good effects of <HI>ve&s;ication</HI> to the head, one of which was in a <HI>phre|nitic</HI> complaint where <HI>torpidity</HI> and <HI>langour</HI> had been brought on by profu&s;e evacuations, and the other in a <HI>maniacal affection,</HI> of &s;ome &s;tanding, when the powers of nature had been debilitated by inanition. In the indi&s;criminate u&s;es of <HI>epi&s;pa&s;tics</HI> to the head, for the cure of
<PB N="20" REF="20"><HI>cerebral</HI> di&s;orders, particularly where an overfulne&s;s is already obvious, much mi&s;chief may be apprehended from their ardent and powerfully &s;timulating influence. <HI>March</HI> 15th, the patient be|came &s;o very raving and re&s;tle&s;s, that having no &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, nor u&s;ing any ligatures to his arms and legs, it was as much as three people could keep him from getting out of bed, in which frantic and turbulent &s;tate he continued until <HI>March</HI> 17th, when another <HI>emetic</HI> was admini&s;tered, but with the &s;ame ineffe|cacy as before. <HI>March</HI> 21&s;t. The vio|lence of the di&s;order &s;eemed abated, and on that and the following day he was not &s;o loud and raving as he had been for many days before but often muttered to him&s;elf, and appeared &s;tupid, ab&s;ent,
<PB N="21" REF="21">and mu&s;ing. <HI>March</HI> 23d, he continued more &s;till and quiet, but very low and melancholic, at any time &s;carcely &s;poke loud enough to be heard, and remained in this depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate until <HI>March</HI> 26, when he &s;eemed to recover more or his u&s;ual &s;pirits, and was at times tolerably con&s;i&s;tent and rational. <HI>March</HI> 27th, his former &s;ymptoms re|curring, my advice and attendance was thought nece&s;&s;ary, and when with the mo&s;t feeling anxiety and &s;ymphathetic concern, the whole of the foregoing account was recollected, and given me in detail, as far as her memory could a&s;&s;i&s;t her, by the afflicted mother of the patient, whom I found removed to a remote part of the hou&s;e, and lodged in a darkened room, with an a&s;&s;i&s;tant on
<PB N="22" REF="22">each &s;ide the bed, for the purpo&s;e of coercion when nece&s;&s;ary, and notwith|standing the length of his confinement, the violence of his di&s;order, and the many relap&s;es to which he had been &s;ubject, he had not that morbid or ema|ciated appearence which might have been expected. Approaching to the bed&s;ide, I did not at fir&s;t &s;eem to attract his attention, but after &s;peaking to him he turned round, and in a low de&s;pond|ing manner, &s;aid, <Q>"He &s;hould never be any better, but that I might do as I plea&s;ed with him, that his father was not able to provide for him, and that he had never been able to learn &s;o quick as other boys;"</Q> to which I made him the mo&s;t con&s;olatory an&s;wers I could &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;oothed him as
<PB N="23" REF="23">much as po&s;&s;ible; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him of the great probability which I entertained of doing him good, and of getting him quite well, provided my rules and directions were punctual|ly followed; by this means appearing to have gained his good opinion, he &s;miled, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed; and to do my little patient ju&s;tice, when in his &s;en&s;es, and capable of &s;o doing, he chearfully &s;trove to &s;econd my endea|vours to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, by an implicit obedience to my advice and in&s;truc|tions. Perceiving that he frequently made &s;udden efforts to jump out of the bed, and that the attendants in endea|vouring to re&s;train him, irritated him the more, I recommended the u&s;e of a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat, which I had brought
<PB N="24" REF="24">with me for that purpo&s;e, and which was u&s;ed before I left the hou&s;e, and continued occa&s;ionally to the end of the cure. From the fir&s;t beginning of his di&s;order, his appetite had been much depraved: upon examination I per|ceived a &s;mall degree of ten&s;ion about the <HI>epiga&s;tric region;</HI> but not attended with any pain, nor had there been the lea&s;t degree of inflammation in the &s;tomach or bowels; his breath had at times been fetid, but not extremely &s;o, and was now rather offen&s;ive; the urine had been &s;ometimes high coloured, and at others pale and limpid; but had never been ob&s;erved to depo&s;it any kind of &s;ediment, and in general had been made in &s;maller quantities than was natural. His deglutition had been
<PB N="25" REF="25">ob&s;erved to be more difficult, when under the paroxy&s;m of dejection, and in his mo&s;t delirious &s;tate, with a &s;light degree of deafne&s;s, moi&s;ture of the eyes, dimne&s;s of &s;ight, and an involuntary di&s;charge of tears, he talked much more incon&s;i&s;tent than when I fir&s;t &s;aw him, and complained of &s;pectres and fright|ful dreams: often when at the be&s;t, I was informed, he appeared drow&s;y and ready to fall a &s;leep, he had frequent eructationry, and his feet were remarked to have been alternately hot, dry, and cold, his eyes &s;ufficiently indicated the perturbed &s;tate of his mind, their pupils were greatly di&s;tended, and the lids tu|mid and red, with a &s;ordid rheum adhe|ring to the edges, his face was florid, but neither bloated nor &s;welled, he expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="26">&s;ome childi&s;hly ridiculous fears, appeared very forgetful, with a &s;mall degree of &s;tupor, and upon a&s;king him where he was mo&s;t in pain, after two or three times waving his hand, as if in doubt, he at la&s;t pointed to his forehead, he appeared to have an equal degree of heat over the whole body, nor was there the lea&s;t augmentation thereof in his head and temples, he was naturally inclined to co&s;tivene&s;s, and the &s;tools he had had through the cour&s;e of his di&s;order, (when not procured by medi|cine,) where generally high coloured, and at the di&s;tance of two or three days; he had not the lea&s;t degree of fever, and the functions of his mind were apparently injured and deranged, he frequently changed his po&s;ition in
<PB N="27" REF="27">bed with an extraordinary degree of velocity and &s;trength, and was &s;o little debilitated, that he appeared to have a greater &s;hare of mu&s;cular &s;trength, than in a healthy &s;tate, is common to boys of his age. I ob&s;erved that he &s;eemed rather plea&s;ed in every opportunity to give his attendants fre&s;h occa&s;ion to watch and guard him, his re&s;piration was not in the lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed, and he had no &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;tomach, his deep had been much interrupted, and &s;eldom long continued, his &s;weats had been partial, and never once either profu&s;e or gene|ral, chiefly in the night, and &s;eldom continued more than a few minutes at a time; probably from the di&s;turbed &s;tate of his mind, and the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his body con&s;equent thereon. In the
<PB N="28" REF="28">paroxy&s;ms he had been &s;ometimes heard to grind and gna&s;h his teeth; had never appeared thir&s;ty, nor at any time had he drank with eagerne&s;s and voracity; his voice was much lower than its natural pitch, and &s;eemed in|capable of continued di&s;tinct articula|tion. The pul&s;e was low, at about &s;ixty, and &s;carcely perceptable, but though &s;o low and weak, I con&s;idered it as a fallacious guide, and that its pre|&s;ent &s;tate was a certain indication either of &s;ome ob&s;truction in the heart or lungs, or &s;ome degree of oppre&s;&s;ion in the <HI>cerebellum.</HI> I was therefore fully &s;atisfied with the expediency of taking away &s;ome blood as the be&s;t prelimi|nary &s;tep to the cure. Vene&s;ection was accordingly performed, and about &s;ix
<PB N="29" REF="29">ounces of blood taken from the arm; immediately after which the vibrations of the artery were manife&s;tly more di&s;tinct and &s;omewhat accelerated; the blood, when cold, was covered with a a very thin cake of gluten, adhered to the ba&s;on, was very bilious, and the &s;erum was of a yellowi&s;h color. Soon after the operation, the child &s;poke rationally for &s;ome time, &s;eemed much le&s;s drow&s;y; was more inclined to &s;leep, than he was before, but in about an hour relap&s;ed into his former &s;tate. I directed a &s;eton to be made between the <HI>&s;capuloe</HI> in the direction of the &s;pine; that his feet &s;hould be frequently im|mer&s;ed in a warm pediluvium of &s;alt and water, and with a view to induce per&s;piration, that he &s;hould often re|cline
<PB N="30" REF="30">his head over the edge of an earthen ve&s;&s;el, and receive the fumes of warm vinegar and water; that he &s;hould be re&s;trained by the u&s;e of the wai&s;tcoat, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require; and be talked to as little as po&s;&s;ible. Con&s;idering the <HI>proximate cau&s;e</HI> of his di&s;order to ari&s;e from a turgency and deten&s;ion in the <HI>cerebral</HI> ve&s;&s;els, I recommended the diet to be cooling, plain and &s;lender, with almo&s;t a total <HI>ab&s;tinence</HI> from liquid food, that <HI>drinks</HI> of all &s;orts &s;hould be <HI>&s;paringly ad|mitted;</HI> and in their &s;tead directed roa&s;ted apples, dried cherries, tama|rinds, or currant jelly, &amp;c. All objects, which engaged his attention, or excited the lea&s;t emotion, were to be removed, with a view to keep his mind calm
<PB N="31" REF="31">and placid; &s;o that all mental irri|tation being taken off, the aptitude of frantic paroxy&s;m might be le&s;&s;ened. He was ordered to ab&s;tain from all flatulent, vi&s;cid, and gro&s;s food, to have more air, and even exerci&s;e, when it could be admitted. As <HI>emetics</HI> had been &s;o repeatedly tried without effect, and were thought hazardous, as they force too great a quantity of blood to the head, I objected to their u&s;e, and pre&s;cribed a <HI>&s;aline purgative</HI> mix|ture, with the infu&s;ion and tincture of &s;ena, to be taken until evacuations &s;hould be procured. Laxatives were continued occa&s;ionally to prevent co&s;|tivene&s;s, and having in many in&s;tances experienced the efficacy and good effects of <HI>camphor</HI> in &s;imilar di&s;orders,
<PB N="32" REF="32">as may be &s;een in my late publication of SELECT CASES OF INSA|NITY, I pre&s;cribed as follows,</P>

<PB N="33" REF="33">off, &s;o as to render the remedy of doubt|ful utility, or perhaps, in a great mea|&s;ure inefficacious. On the day after my vi&s;it, <HI>March</HI> 28th, I was informed the patient had pa&s;&s;ed a tolerable ea&s;y night and had derived the expected re|lief from the purgative medicine. <HI>March</HI> 29th, he had &s;ome &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, which was attributed to the <HI>camphor,</HI> on which account the julep was directed to be given in le&s;s quan|tities, and not &s;o often, <HI>March</HI> 30th, the report was &s;till more favourable, he was more rational, and talked with recollection and propriety, but was &s;ubject to remitting pains in his head. <HI>March</HI> 31&s;t, he became very low, in|deed, and was in every re&s;pect in a &s;tate &s;imilar to that at the commence|ment
<PB N="34" REF="34">of his complaint. <HI>April</HI> 1&s;t, he was tolerably rational; but complained of his head, with depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, and cried very much, &s;aid <Q>"nobody loved him, and that he &s;hould not be happy in a future &s;tate."</Q><HI>April</HI> 2d. having pa&s;&s;ed a very indifferent night, he was attacked with cold &s;hiverings and yawning, cried very much, and intreated his mother to come, which &s;he did; but his di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety continued the &s;ame as before. The &s;eton began to di&s;charge plentifully, in the afternoon, his head was ea&s;ier, he appeared better, and the depre&s;&s;ions were of much &s;horter duration than they had been. <HI>April</HI> 3d, he had a to|lerable good night, and was &s;till more rational and quiet than the day before;
<PB N="35" REF="35">upon the whole, there appeared a pro|bable chance of &s;ucce&s;s by a continua|tion of the plan fir&s;t laid down. <HI>April</HI> 4th, after a tolerable night, early in the morning the depre&s;&s;ion returned, his feet being damp and cold, the <HI>pedilu|vium</HI> was u&s;ed; he had no occa&s;ion for opening medicines, having had fecal evacuations regularly once, and &s;ometimes twice, on the three preceding days; the urine had continued its pro|per cour&s;e. <HI>April</HI> 5th, the urine was very high coloured, without &s;ediment, or fever, the belly regular, pul&s;e &s;e|venty. The di&s;charge from the &s;eton was little, but from the i&s;&s;ue much increa&s;ed; in the night he was rather re&s;tle&s;s, with &s;light wanderings of the mind, but more rational in the day|time.
<PB N="36" REF="36">The regimen continued to be punctually ob&s;erved, and the patient was carried out in the open air up|wards of an hour. <HI>April</HI> 6th, he com|plained of his belly, and was ob&s;erved to rub and pick his no&s;e, with &s;ome degree of lowne&s;s, a &s;udden lo&s;s of voice, and palene&s;s of countenance; he complained of nau&s;ea at his &s;tomach, his breath was unu&s;ually fetid, in the night, he was very watchful, and in|coherent in his expre&s;&s;ions, and had trouble&s;ome dreams, with evident marks of indige&s;tion. <HI>April</HI> 7th, he was much the &s;ame all day, the night was re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, the fetor of the breath continuing, with pricking &s;en&s;ations of the abdomen and a frequent irri|tation to &s;tool, induced an idea of worms
<PB N="37" REF="37">being the cau&s;e; but as the excrements had never appeared white or &s;limy, and none had ever been voided by &s;tool; that they really did exi&s;t was a matter of doubt; however, from the foregoing evidence, I thought it advi&s;eable to try the <HI>mercurius &s;accharatus</HI> of the Ebinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atory; both as a good evacuant, and a &s;afe <HI>vermifuge;</HI> this medicine after being taken twice, occa&s;ioned two dejections within the &s;pace of a few hours; but no worms, nor any thing of a <HI>verminous</HI> nature appearing in the &s;tools, and the &s;ymp|toms which had given ri&s;e to this &s;up|po&s;ition &s;till continuing, the more effec|tually to di&s;lodge them, if they did exi&s;t; I pre&s;cribed one grain of the
<PB N="38" REF="38"><HI>gum gut. gamb.</HI> with half a grain of <HI>calo|mel,</HI> and an additional proportion of <HI>&s;accharum,</HI> made into the form of a powder, to be exhibited at proper pe|riods, be&s;ides which, I directed &s;ome garlic to be cut &s;mall, and between whiles to be given in milk, but neither of the&s;e remedies producing the lea&s;t appearance of worms, and the patient being apparently not &s;o well in many re&s;pects as before, he di&s;continued his former regimen and medicines. <HI>April</HI> 11th. They were had recour&s;e to again, the purgative medicine being directed to be intermitted as u&s;ual&mdash;we had now a partial &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, which was &s;oon removed by mild diu|retics.&mdash;It was an ob&s;ervation made by tho&s;e about him, that he was
<PB N="39" REF="39">always more in his &s;en&s;es, and that his head was always cleare&s;t when there was a plenty of urine, and that this had been the ca&s;e from the commencement of his di&s;order; it was therefore a &s;ymp|tom which more particularly required an alleviation, and was removed without much difficulty by &s;mall do&s;es of the <HI>&s;piritus nitri dulcis</HI> in <HI>par&s;ley-root tea,</HI> and to the prevention of which the warm pediluvium, which was con|&s;tantly continued, did in great mea&s;ure contribute. <HI>April</HI> 12th, he appeared much better in every re&s;pect, his mind was &s;ettled and quiet, and he was taken into the air, and except &s;ome flatulen|cies in the &s;tomach, pa&s;&s;ed the day in a much more rational manner than at any time before; but in the evening was
<PB N="40" REF="40">again very low, &s;ighed much, and was incongruous in his &s;peech and beha|viour, but not turbulently &s;o, he &s;lept but little all that night, and the next morning appeared drow&s;y and low|&s;pirited, which was in great mea&s;ure attributed to taking cold in his airing the day before. <HI>April</HI> 13th. After ha|ving had a tolerable good night he got up and dre&s;&s;ed, walked about the room and was very rational; the &s;eton which before had been very fore and painful, di&s;charged more and became ea&s;ier; having had no &s;tool for two days, the purgative medicine was given and re|peated at proper di&s;tances, but not ha|ving its u&s;ual effect in the evening, an emollient cly&s;ter was admini&s;tered, which produced &s;tools of a fetid and
<PB N="41" REF="41">loo&s;e kind, and he had this night a more general and long continued per|&s;piration than at any time before during his illne&s;s; but was at intervals watch|ful and re&s;tle&s;s. <HI>April</HI> 14th, he was very &s;en&s;ible, and at his own reque&s;t again taken out into the air for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, continued tolerably rational all day; but in the evening was again depre&s;&s;ed and low, wander|ed in his conver&s;ation from one &s;ubject to another, and complained of pain and weight in his head. The warm <HI>pedilu|vium</HI> was made u&s;e of for half an hour before, and at bed-time, the <HI>camphora|ted julep</HI> was given, his &s;leep was fre|quently interrupted with terrifying dreams, he had no &s;tool, and in the morning awoke very &s;orrowful and
<PB N="42" REF="42">low, and continued in that &s;tate through the greate&s;t part of the day. <HI>April</HI> 15th, he was much the &s;ame, in the forenoon he took twice of the camphorated <HI>julep,</HI> and in the after|noon once of the laxative medicine, which had no effect; he had little or no appetite, appeared much out of temper, and at times talked wild and incon&s;i&s;tently; in the evening a cly&s;ter was given, which &s;oon after returned without doing any &s;ervice. The night was pa&s;&s;ed in watchfulne&s;s, and much interrupted by frightful dreams. <HI>April</HI> 16th, he appeared much clearer in his intellects, but complained of pain in his head, with a ten&s;ion of the <HI>abdomen</HI> and difficult re&s;piration; the <HI>oleum ri|cini</HI> was therefore pre&s;cribed in&s;tead of
<PB N="43" REF="43">the former purgative, the &s;econd do&s;e of which procured a &s;tool &s;oon after it was taken; but he was not able to pa&s;s any water, nor had he made a drop for the la&s;t four and twenty hours. The <HI>&s;piritus nitri dulcis</HI> was therefore again directed to be taken in a cupful of <HI>par&s;ley-root tea,</HI> till he made water freely&mdash;he continued calm all the day, but not very rational, and had rather a better night than before. <HI>April</HI> 17th, he was very low, &s;poke but little, and at times was rather ab&s;urd in his actions and behaviour; continued &s;o all the day, and pa&s;&s;ed but a very indifferent night. <HI>April</HI> 18th, he had a free pa&s;|&s;age, and had no occa&s;ion for either the drops or oil. <HI>April</HI> 19th, he was very compo&s;ed and con&s;i&s;tent; the feet were
<PB N="44" REF="44">continued to be immer&s;ed in the warm <HI>pediluvium,</HI> and continued moi&s;t and warm; he per&s;pired during his &s;leep, which was longer and but little interrupted; and made water freely; it was of a reddi&s;h colour, and depo&s;ited alight &s;ediment. <HI>April</HI> 19th and 20th, he continued in a comfortable &s;tate, had good nights, and his appetite re|turned. <HI>April</HI> 21&s;t he was very low, and complained of his head, and having had no &s;tool for three days, a &s;poonful of the oil was given him, which an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e &s;oon after it was taken; his head was relieved, he con|tinued cool and rational all the day, and had a very good night. <HI>April</HI> 22d, At his own particular reque&s;t he was placed in a little carriage for &s;everal
<PB N="45" REF="45">hours, drawn about in the air, and was indulged in every little amu&s;ement that could be thought of; but with the pre|caution, that the <HI>mental faculty</HI> &s;hould not be permitted to dwell too long at a time on any object whatever; he now began to &s;peak and play about in his u&s;ual manner, and with more vivacity, it was ob&s;erved, than before his di&s;or|der took place. He wi&s;hed to ride on hor&s;eback, but for the pre&s;ent it was thought improper, and he patiently acquie&s;ced in that opinion. As the &s;ingularity of his ca&s;e excited much cu|rio&s;ity, many per&s;ons had a de&s;ire to &s;ee him, but none were admitted &s;o to do, but tho&s;e he had been previou&s;ly acquainted with&mdash;if by chance he &s;aw
<PB N="46" REF="46">any &s;trangers, it was remarked that the &s;ight of them did not hurry and agitate his mind &s;o much as it had done in the former part of his complaint. He con|tinued in a quiet and rational &s;tate un|der the &s;ame regulation of diet and medicine as before enjoined, until <HI>May</HI> 10, when after an indifferent night, very early in the morning he was re|attacked with his former unaccountable lowne&s;s of &s;pirits and melancholic ideas, his mind became alternately agitated with fear and &s;orrow, &s;u&s;picion and &s;olicitude, and continued &s;o all the day, having had no regular &s;tools for the la&s;t two days; &s;ome of the oil was given, the fir&s;t do&s;e of which had no effect; the &s;econd an&s;wered the pur|po&s;e, but from this as well as &s;ome
<PB N="47" REF="47">&s;leep which he got in the fir&s;t part of the night, he derived but little benefit. The <HI>pediluvium</HI> and <HI>camphorated julep</HI> were continued regularly, and <HI>May</HI> 12th he appeared much more tranquil, but complained of pain in the lower bowels, which was removed by a &s;ti|mulating cly&s;ter, after two do&s;es of the oil had been tried in vain. <HI>May</HI> 13th, he was affected with a pain in his head, and his eyes being &s;lightly inflamed, and the lids rather &s;welled and red, by my direction a &s;urgeon was &s;ent for to bleed him, who at fir&s;t objected to the operation, on account of the low|ne&s;s in his pul&s;e; but at the reque&s;t of the mother, through re&s;pect to my advice, his opinion was overruled, and he took away about <HI>twelve
<PB N="48" REF="48">ounces of blood;</HI> he bled very &s;low, and did not appear to mi&s;s the blood at all; until his arm was binding up, when he turned pale, his lips became white, and he was all over in per&s;piration, but &s;oon recovered without fainting. The pul&s;e, after bleeding, was ob&s;erved to be more manife&s;t to the touch, &s;tronger, and rather more accelerated. Upon enquiry, I found the blood had a &s;light <HI>buffy</HI> appearance, and by way of cu|rio&s;ity upon being divided and put into &s;cales, the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> weighed <HI>&s;ix ounces and three quarters,</HI> and the <HI>&s;erum five ounces and a half:</HI> an experiment made to plea&s;e the fancy, and for the &s;atisfaction of the mother of the patient. The &s;eton had di&s;charged little, but the i&s;&s;ue very much, which
<PB N="49" REF="49">had been the ca&s;e all along; after bleed|ing he pa&s;&s;ed the night well, and was tolerably well all the next day. <HI>May</HI> 15th, he was rather low and incon&s;i&s;tent in his di&s;cour&s;e, having had no &s;tool the u&s;ual quantity of oil was given and re|peated, but without effect. <HI>May</HI> 16th, he was not &s;o low as ye&s;terday and more con&s;i&s;tent, but having made no water all the former day and night, the &s;car|city of it was relieved as u&s;ual by the <HI>drops</HI> and <HI>par&s;ley-root tea. May</HI> l7th, he was very dull, talked but little, and &s;eemed not much to attend to external objects. <HI>May</HI> 18th. Having pa&s;&s;ed a very good night, and having had a natural &s;tool in the morning, he ap|peared much better in every re&s;pect, and was very tractable, &s;till, and ra|tional
<PB N="50" REF="50">all day. <HI>May</HI> 19th, he appeared quite comfortable and happy, and de|&s;ired to ride on hor&s;eback, which by my direction was agreed to. At the &s;ame time I advi&s;ed, that he &s;hould receive every admi&s;&s;ible gratification. From this time, he continued rational in his conver&s;ation, and con&s;i&s;tent in his behaviour; but was frequently too high-&s;pirited, and &s;ometimes rather trouble&s;ome to rule, and it was not without the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome au|thority, that he was prevailed on to per&s;evere in any part of the <HI>regimen</HI> which had been before enjoined; for having recovered his liberty, and ex|perienced the indulgent partiality na|turally re&s;ulting from the joy of the parent, who&s;e tendere&s;t feelings had
<PB N="51" REF="51">been &s;o long exerci&s;ed on his account, and as he got better, the diet having been allowed to be more liberal and nutritious, though &s;mall in quantity and gradually increa&s;ed, he began to con&s;ider every re&s;traint with more im|patience&mdash;although in general he con|formed to order tolerably well. On account of &s;udden &s;light inflammation and itching in his right eye, it was thought advi&s;able to repeat the bleed|ing on the <HI>&s;eventh of June,</HI> from which time every di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and tumultuary motion &s;ub&s;ided, and he has continued without interruption in the full pleni|tude of his mental faculties, to the com|fort and grateful acknowledgment of his worthy and re&s;pectable family. The &s;eton was dried up &s;oon after the
<PB N="52" REF="52">la&s;t bleeding, but the i&s;&s;ue in the arm has been kept open. It is very &s;ingular that ever &s;ince his recovery he has been much more chearful and &s;prightly, and not in the lea&s;t &s;ubject to that lowne&s;s and dejection of &s;pirits which had always before been con&s;idered as naturally attached to his temper and di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be thought that one Ca&s;e, however &s;triking, may not be &s;ufficient|ly conclu&s;ive to determine the efficacy of any new plan of cure, but there are &s;everal more that have come under my ob&s;ervation; among&s;t the&s;e the two following are worthy the con&s;ideration of Medical Practitioners.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="54">
<P>A man about Forty-eight years of age, naturally of a melancholic tempera|ment, without any apparent cau&s;e, on a &s;udden, became &s;ullen, re&s;erved, and moro&s;e, &s;hewed a great propen&s;ity to &s;uicide, and his mind gradually &s;unk into the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of dejec|tion and melancholy; his memory was very defective, the lucid intervals were of &s;hort and momentary duration, his appetite was depraved there was a con|&s;tipation of the bowels, he was &s;ome|times very deaf, was &s;ubject to eructa|tions, with involuntary motion of the eyes; his countenance was pallid, and his face bloated and &s;welled, he had often the mo&s;t ridiculous fears and apprehen&s;ions, and now and then com|plained of a pain as though a nail were
<PB N="47" REF="55">driven into his head, with an unea&s;ine&s;s in the right hypochondrium, which upon examination appeared rather hard and &s;welled; he had taken &s;everal vo|mits, and had a bli&s;ter to the head with|out receiving the lea&s;t advantage from either, he had never been in the lea&s;t re&s;trained from fluids, but on the con|trary &s;uffered to indulge in the free u&s;e of tho&s;e, to which he was mo&s;t partial; when he was placed under my care, the pul&s;e was in general about eighty, rather weak and &s;mall, but became evidently &s;tronger and greater, after the effu&s;ion of &s;ix ounces of blood from the arm; evacuating cathartics were pre&s;cribed occa&s;ionally, a &s;eton was opened between the &s;houlders in the direction of the &s;pine; and Ten grains of
<PB N="48" REF="56">camphor were admini&s;tered in a bolus, four times in a day. <HI>Ab&s;tinence from fluids</HI> was ob&s;erved with the greate&s;t care and circum&s;pection, their quantities being gradually abridged, and almo&s;t totally left off for nearly five months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively according to <HI>Dr. Rowley's &s;y&s;tem,</HI> at the end of which period there remained not the lea&s;t incongruity of idea, his perception was clear, and his judgment as &s;ound as at any former period of his life, he voluntarily conti|nued with me &s;ome months after the cure, and has ever &s;ince retained the full enjoyment of his health and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>A YOUNG lady about the age of twenty &s;even, naturally of a habit ob|noxious to inflammatory di&s;orders, who&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="57">mother had unfortunately been &s;ubject to <HI>chronic</HI> madne&s;s, was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a rigor &s;ucceeded by an acute in|flammatory fever, a quick full and ten&s;e pul&s;e, great heat, thir&s;t, and acute pains in the head, back and loins, and &s;light deli|rium, with dimne&s;s of &s;ight, to moderate the febrile &s;ymptoms vene&s;ection, cool|ing <HI>diaphoretics</HI> and diluting drinks were pre&s;cribed. On the ninth day from the attack, loo&s;e &s;tools and turbid urine, confirmed the cri&s;is of the di&s;order, and the more violent &s;ymptoms con&s;e|quently &s;ub&s;iding, the <HI>cortex</HI> took place as a tonic, and &s;he was thought to be in a promi&s;ing &s;tate of convale&s;cence, but an anxiety and &s;olicitude of mind very unu&s;ual to her before her illne&s;s, &s;uper|vening &s;erved as a confirmation to her
<PB N="50" REF="58">friends of her being in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the morbid patrimony of her mother, her appetite was depraved, her pul&s;e quick and hard, and her breath was uncommonly hot and offen&s;ive, &s;he talked wild, and with almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant vociferation, got but little &s;leep, with le&s;s per&s;piration, expre&s;&s;ed fal&s;e fears, and often de&s;cribed images which did not exi&s;t, &s;he often &s;huddered with cold, and was afterwards hot and thir&s;|ty, after a continuation in this phrenetic &s;tate for &s;everal days, &s;he was committ|ed to my care. I found &s;he had been &s;uffered to drink copiou&s;ly of diluting liquors, the &s;erous ve&s;&s;els were tinged with red blood, the eye lids puffed and tumid, the <HI>tunica albuginea</HI> was red and inflam|ed, and the pupils much di&s;tended, there
<PB N="51" REF="59">was an uncommon floridity of the face, a great di&s;coloration of the tongue, and difficulty of re&s;piration; at intervals &s;he became &s;ilent, re&s;erved, and melan|choly, at other times &s;o ob&s;treperous and violent, as to render coercion ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, the pul&s;e was hard and <HI>cordlike,</HI> and about an hundred and twenty &s;trokes in a minute, <HI>vene|&s;ectio ad deliquum</HI> was advi&s;ed, the blood appeared to be in a very inflamed and di&s;ordered &s;tate, neutral &s;alts were admini&s;tered occa&s;ionally, the warm <HI>pediluvium</HI> was directed every night before &s;he went to bed, camphor and nitre were given at &s;tated intervals, and almo&s;t a <HI>total ab&s;tinence</HI> from fluids, was enjoined for nearly two months, in which time vene&s;ection was thrice
<PB N="52" REF="60">repeated; when the <HI>mental perturbation</HI> which was evidently dependent on the fever, and a type thereof, together with the primary cau&s;e terminated fa|vourably, &s;he &s;taid with me &s;ome months after the cure, had no relap&s;e, and has remained perfectly clear in her intel|lects ever &s;ince.</P>
