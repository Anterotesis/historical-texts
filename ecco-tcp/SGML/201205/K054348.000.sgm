<P>I Mu&s;t here acquaint the Reader, that through the whole I have not once made u&s;e of the common, tho' barbarous, word <HI>Man-midwife,</HI> except in quotations, becau&s;e it carries Non&s;en&s;e in the very front of it: How can a Man be a Wife, except he be a <HI>Hermaphrodite?</HI> May they not as properly &s;ay a Man-Monkey, a Man-Goo&s;e, or a Man-A&s;s. The French expre&s;s it very beautifully by the word Accoucheur, i. e. a Man who delivers women in labour. And I &s;hall always expre&s;s it by the Word Midman; which, tho' not &s;o neat as the French, yet is much better than the ab&s;urd Word complained of.</P>
<P>THE common Word Midwife is al&s;o often very improperly u&s;ed, E. G. A. Maid may be taught the art of delivering women, yet &s;he is not a Wife. Widows al&s;o lay women, yet they are not Wives. Therefore to reconcile this impropriety, I &s;hall al|ways, except in quotations, call them Midwomen, which includes Maids, Wives, and Widows. But Dr. Maubray, (the wor&s;t writer on this &s;ubject) and Mr. Chapman after him, make u&s;e of another appellation, much more ab&s;urd, viz. Woman-Mid|wife, Women-Midvives: Pray would not &s;aying Midwife and Midwives, di&s;tingui&s;h their &s;ex &s;uffi|ciently? Pray who ever heard of Girl-Midwives?</P>

<HEAD>THE STATE of MIDWIFERY.</HEAD>
<P>_IS it not very &s;urpri&s;ing, nay and un|accountable, that tho' almo&s;t all the other parts of Surgery have been cul|tivated with great a&s;&s;iduity, by the mo&s;t knowing Men, ever &s;ince Hip|pocrates, nay and before him, yet ('till about the middle of the la&s;t century) the operations nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of women in labour, and their children; operations of more con&s;equence to mankind than almo&s;t all the re&s;t; operations &s;o often wanted, &s;o difficult many times to perform, and upon which al|ways two, and &s;ometimes more lives depend, &s;eem to have been entirely left to a parcel of ignorant women, or to Men little better qualified than they, who upon any extraordinary difficulty (as too many &s;till do) took hooks or knives, and carved the chil|dren to pieces; and often al&s;o de&s;troyed the Mother?</P>
<P>The Surgeons at Paris, &amp;c. to remedy this evil, have for many years pa&s;t, obliged all the Midwo|men to be examined and approved of at their hall, before ever they dare &s;et up for practice: An ex|ample mo&s;t worthy of imitation! But how, or by what infatuation, our <HI>Dom. fac. totum</HI> &s;uffered the&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="7">operations to drop through their fingers, (as if they were no part of their profe&s;&s;ion, as if they were not manual operations, or were of little or no con&s;e|quence to mankind,) into the hands of Doctors, <HI>inferioris &s;ortis medici,</HI> (as a certain Gentleman calls them,) Apothecaries, and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of their own Fraternity! (&s;ome of whom have been, and are, as illiterate, of as low capacities, and as little acquainted with the other great operations of Surgery, as almo&s;t any of the women) and have and do allow every &s;illy woman, who takes it in her head, with very little or no in&s;truction, to practice <HI>impun&egrave;</HI> among his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, without any the lea&s;t examination or licence! are que&s;tions I &s;hall not now take upon me to an&s;wer. But to proceed:</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rational account we ever had of deli|vering women in labour, was publi&s;hed at Paris by Mr. Mauriceau, in 1668. In his dedication, he gives the following hone&s;t account of his de&s;ign: <Q>I have the rather undertaken this work, that Midwives might find therein what they ought to know, the better to exerci&s;e their art, and un|dergo the examination they are obliged to at Surgeons-Hall, before they are admitted to practice.</Q> In his preface, he &s;ays, <Q>I have not run out into &s;uperfluous di&s;cour&s;e</Q> (i. e. he had avoided all puzzling and unintelligible Theories and Hypothe&s;es, about generation, nutrition, &s;uperfoetation, and &s;uch &s;ort of jar|gon,) <Q>that I might be more &s;erviceable both to Surgeons and Midwives.</Q></P>
<P>THIS plain practical work, would undoubted|ly have had a much better effect upon our Mid|women,
<PB N="3" REF="8">had they not been puzzled and confound|ed, (in&s;tead of being in&s;tructed) by the artful in&s;i|nuations of the tran&s;lator, in his preface and mar|ginal notes, publi&s;hed in 1672. as will appear by the following quotations.</P>
<P>DR. Chamberlen, in his preface, &s;ays, <Q>Hav|ing long ob&s;erved the great want of nece&s;&s;ary directions how to govern women with child, and in child-bed, &amp;c. I de&s;ign'd a &s;mall ma|nual to that purpo&s;e; but meeting &s;ome time after in France with this treati&s;e of Mauriceau, which in my opinion exceeds all former Au|thors, I changed my re&s;olution into that of tran&s;lating him; whom I need not much com|mend, becau&s;e he is fortified with the approba|tion of the wardens of the Surgeons company of Paris.</Q> Pray would the Doctor have thought he had been &s;o well fortified, if he had had the approba|tion of the then wardens of the Surgeons company of London? or the approbation of the college of phy|&s;icians at Paris? <Q>I have carefully rendered his book into Engli&s;h, for the benefit of our Mid|wives.</Q> This is certainly a very fair and hone&s;t Exordium, a worthy and laudablc De&s;ign; but pray mark the end on't: <Q>Of whom many may yet very well admit of an additional knowledge.</Q> This cannot be denied, but pray where are they to go look for this additional knowledge, if he means, in their profe&s;&s;ion? Is it to be found in his preface and marginal notes upon Mauriceau's work? No! they rather darken, than explain, the Author's meaning. But the additional knowledge the Doctor means, and has taken &s;uch pains to inculcate, through the
<PB N="4" REF="9">whole of his preface and notes, is to inform them the He and his family can a&s;&s;i&s;t them better than any other Men; that they have no bu&s;ine&s;s to meddle with any child, except tho&s;e who ju&s;t drop into their hands, and that whenever the lea&s;t difficulty appears, to &s;end for him, or &s;ome or the No&s;trum|mongers; as will appear evidently from the tenure of the whole.</P>
<P>THEN he goes on, <Q>The principal thing wor|thy the ob&s;ervation of Midwives in this book, is accurately to di&s;cover what is properly their work, and when it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end for ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that &s;o, <HI>many women and children may be pre&s;erved, that now peri&s;h for want of &s;ea&s;onable help.</HI></Q> i. e. &s;hall victims to the ignorance of Midwomen. <Q>And that Midwife's &s;kill is certainly the greate&s;t, and &s;he de&s;erves mo&s;t commendation, who can &s;oone&s;t di&s;cover the &s;ucce&s;s of the labour, and accordingly either wait with patience, or timely &s;end for advice and help.</Q> Pray is not that Midwwoman's &s;kill &s;till greater? and does &s;he not de&s;erve much more commendation? who can &s;oone&s;t di&s;cover what ob&s;tructs the delivery, and then removes the ob&s;truction her&s;elf, and thereby &s;aves the woman the fright, trouble, and expence, of &s;ending for any farther help or advice? <Q>Nor can it be &s;o great a di&s;credit to a Midwife (let &s;ome of them imagine what they plea&s;e) to have a woman or child &s;aved by a man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as to &s;uffer either to die under her own hand, tho' delivered: For that Midwife mi&s;takes her office, that thinks &s;he hath performed it, by only laying
<PB N="5" REF="10">the woman; becau&s;e her principal duty is to take care that &s;he and her child be well, with &s;afety and convenient &s;peed parted;</Q> who don't know that? <Q>and, if this be impo&s;&s;ible for her, it will ju&s;tify her better to wave her imagi|nary reputation, and &s;end for help.</Q> No doubt of it. But would it not have been much better if they had been taught to do their office them&s;elves?</P>
<P>THUS you &s;ee Mr. Mauriceau's de&s;ign in pub|li&s;hing his book, was to in&s;truct the Midwomen how to perform their office better; but Dr. Cham|berlen perverts that de&s;ign, and &s;eems to have the Intere&s;t of the Midmen, and not that of the Mid|women, or &mdash; principally at heart, as is evi|dent from the foregoing quotations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e coaxes and threats, which he plays off &s;o bri&s;kly upon the town Mid|women, (who are undoubtedly much better qualifi|ed, than tho&s;e in the country) in ca&s;e they don't &s;end for him, &amp;c. on every trifling difficulty, he goes on, and &s;ays, <Q>Yet in countries and places where help and good advice is not &s;ea&s;onably to be had, Midwives are compelled to do their be&s;t, as God &s;hall enable them.</Q> Pray has God any where promi&s;ed to give more a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a country than a town Midwoman? Thus the poor country Midwomen are to act as God &s;hall enable them; but the town Midwomen, as the Doctor &amp;c. &s;hall direct, <HI>Utrum horum!</HI> Pray has God Almighty given us the lea&s;t ground to expect, that he will in|&s;pire us in an in&s;tant, even upon the mo&s;t urgent occa&s;ion, with the perfect knowledge of any u&s;e|ful art, only becau&s;e it would ju&s;t then be of &s;er|vice
<PB N="6" REF="11">to us? No. But he has told us, that, if we want to acquire the knowledge of any u&s;eful art, we mu&s;t diligently and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly apply our&s;elves to the &s;tudy of it in the mo&s;t proper manner we can. <HI>Dii laborantibus omnia vendunt!</HI><Q>Which dan|gerous and uncertain trials in doth not become them to put in practice upon women, where no timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance need be wanting.</Q> Thus you &s;ee, the Doctor thinks dangerous and un|certain trials may lawfully be put in practice on women in the country, tho' not upon tho&s;e in town, where he and the re&s;t of the No&s;trum|mongers may be had. But, pray, might not many of the&s;e uncertain and dangerous trials, both in town and country, have been prevented, if he had endeavoured as much to in&s;truct them how to give better a&s;&s;i&s;tance them&s;elves, as he has done to let them know when to &s;end for him, &amp;c. Are not the women's lives in the country as va|luable as tho&s;e in town?</P>
<P>THEN he goes on to tell them in what particu|lar ca&s;es they ought to &s;end for him, &amp;c. viz. "1. In mo&s;t wrong births, with or without pain." (alias with or without danger or difficulty) <Q>2. All floodings with clods, tho' little or no pain, whether at full time or not. 3. All convul&s;ions. 4. Many fir&s;t labours. 5. And &s;ome other;</Q> (i. e. every other ca&s;e, when the People are &s;ub|&s;tantial,) viz. <Q>tho' the child be right, if little or no pain, after the breaking of the waters, and the child's not following them in &s;ome &s;ix or ten hours after, require the good advice of, and, peradventure, &s;peedy delivery by expert phy&s;i|cians
<PB N="7" REF="12">clans in this practice.</Q> Pray would not expert Sur|geons in this practice do as well? Is it not evident from the Doctor's li&s;t of ca&s;es, that very few wo|men (except tho&s;e in the country, or who are very poor) could e&s;cape tho&s;e expert Phy&s;icians? viz. He, his father, and two brothers.</P>
<P>BUT lea&s;t the charge he has given to the Mid|women (of &s;ending for him, &amp;c. upon every tri|fling occa&s;ion) &s;hould not have weight enough, he al&s;o threatens the poor &s;uffering women with what may happen to them, in ca&s;e they don't oblige their Midwomen to &s;end for them. <Q>Let me therefore advi&s;e the good women, not &s;o readily to blame tho&s;e Midwives who are not backward in dangerous ca&s;es," <HI>(or not dangerous ca&s;es,)</HI> to de&s;ire advice, lea&s;t it co&s;t them dear;" (pray don't it always co&s;t them dear when they do?) by di&s;couraging and forcing them to pre&s;ume beyond their knowledge and &s;trength,</Q> As for their want of knowledge, I take it to be more their misfortune than their fault, becau&s;e they have not yet had &s;uch proper opportunities of informing them&s;elves, as they ought to have; but as to &s;trength, I'm &s;atisfied mo&s;t of them have enough, did they know how to make a proper u&s;e of it. e&s;pecially when too many are over confident." For this compliment the Midwomen are as much obliged to him, as for many others he pa&s;&s;es upon them.</P>
<P>In another place he &s;ays, <Q>If therefore the u&s;e of hooks by Phy&s;icians</Q> (pray what bu&s;ine&s;s have phy&s;icians with hooks? Are not pen, ink, and paper, their proper in&s;truments? What right
<PB N="8" REF="13">have they then to encroach upon us? Don't they make a &s;ad outcry, are not they alarmed as if their craft was in danger, when we u&s;e pen and ink? except in Pauper ca&s;es. <Q>and Sur|geons, be condemned, (without thereto nece&s;|&s;itated by &s;ome mon&s;trous birth, &amp;c.)</Q> Now you &s;ee he is obliged to own, notwith&s;tanding all he &s;ays to the contrary, that hooks are &s;ome|times ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. <Q>We can much le&s;s approve of a Midwife's u&s;ing them, as &s;ome here in England boa&s;t they do; which ra&s;h pre&s;ump|tion, in France, would call them in que&s;tion for their lives.</Q> The Doctor allows, pag. 5. country Midwives are compelled to do their be&s;t as God &s;hall direct; them: Now &s;uppo&s;ing that God &s;hould direct one of them to make u&s;e of a croch|et, in a fit ca&s;e, and after a proper manner, mu&s;t &s;he be tried for her life for it? Is not this a very hard charge upon the poor Midwomen, with|out any proof? I mu&s;t diffent &s;o far from the Doc|tor's opinion, that I believe the hardie&s;t Mid|woman in London, would tremble at the very thought of it, unle&s;s they were fully in&s;tructed how to u&s;e it, as&mdash;; but for what they may do in the country, according to the Doctor's advice, above recited, I cannot an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mr. Mauriceau (pag. 179.) &s;ays, <Q>A Midwife vaunted &s;he was more &s;kilful in her art than any Surgeon.</Q> Upon which Dr. Chamberlen remarks, that, <Q>It &s;eems Midwives in other countries, as well as England, have that pernicious vanity.</Q> But, pray were there no Midmen then in Eng|land, who had vaunted they could perform what
<PB N="9" REF="14">they really could not? Vid. Mr. Mauriceau's 26th ob&s;ervation, quoted below.</P>
<P>MR. Mauriceau, pag. 203. <Q>If the arm be ad|vanced as far as the &s;houlder, &amp;c. Dr. Chamberlen remarks, which &s;eldom is, unle&s;s an Ignorant Midwife tamper with it.</Q> Are not the&s;e pretty compliments? but where is the in&s;truction? Are not all practitioners, of the very lea&s;t experience, &s;en&s;ible it often happens without any tampering. But notwith&s;tanding he has been &s;o lavi&s;h in the&s;e, and many other places, in cen&s;uring tho&s;e good women, yet he winds up his preface with a &s;alvo for all, viz. <Q>I hope no good Midwives will blame me for reprehending the faults of Bad ones, who are only aimed at, and admoni&s;hed in this work; and I'm confident none but the Guilty will be concerned, and take it to them&s;elves, which I de&s;ire they may, and amend.</Q> Is not this cobweb ea&s;ily &s;een through? Is not this the fir&s;t time he has mentioned good Midwives?</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Dr. Chamberlen's account of his &s;ecret.</HEAD>
<P>HE is not content with amu&s;iing, confound|ing, nay, and abu&s;ing the Midwomen, at the &s;ame time he makes a &s;hew of teaching them, but al&s;o &s;erves the Midmen the &s;ame &s;auce; by telling them he has a &s;ecret, which will do won|ders, i. e. It will &s;ave many children's lives, which, they who do not know it, <HI>(or &s;omething as good,)</HI> mu&s;t de&s;troy; but cannot in honour (notwith&s;tanding it might &s;ave thou&s;ands of lives)
<PB N="10" REF="15">di&s;cover it even to them, becau&s;e it might preju|dice the per&s;onal intere&s;t of his father and two brothers, who only, in all Europe, know it: But what they may do in Africa, A&s;ia, &amp;c. this deponent &s;ayeth not. His own &s;tory is as fol|lows: <Q>My Author, lib. ii. cap. 17. ju&s;tifies the fa&s;tening hooks in the head of a child that comes right, and yet becau&s;e of &s;ome difficulty or di&s;proportion, cannot pa&s;s; which I confe&s;s has been, and is yet the practice of the mo&s;t expert arti&s;ts in Midwifery, not only in Eng|land, but throughout Europe. But I can neither approve of that practice, nor tho&s;e delays;</Q> (Pray ob&s;erve how long he was in attempting to deliver that woman at Paris, vid. M. M. ob&s;. 26. quoted below; <Q>becau&s;e my father, brothers, and &s;elf,</Q> (tho' none el&s;e in Europe as I know,) Pray had not Sir David Hamilton more bu&s;ine&s;s, and as good, if not better &s;ucce&s;s, in the practice of Midwifery than he? May we not then rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that he either knew his &s;ecret, or had one of his own, tho' he never made any noi&s;e about it, which an&s;wered as well? <Q>have, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, and our iudu&s;try, attained to, and long practi&s;ed a way to deliver women in this ca&s;e, without any prejudice to them or their infants; tho' all others (being obliged, for want of &s;uch an expedient, to u&s;e the common way) do, and mu&s;t endanger, if not de&s;troy one or both with hooks.</Q> Pray would it not have been a grateful return, for God's ble&s;&s;ing them with &s;o u&s;eful a &s;ecret, to have communicated it to the re&s;t of the Midmen, whereby the de&s;truction
<PB N="11" REF="16">of &s;o many women and children, might have been prevented? <Q>By this manual operation a labour may be di&s;patched, (on the lea&s;t difficulty)</Q> &s;o that on the lea&s;t difficulty, either to Midwomen or Midmen, we mu&s;t immediately run for one of the No&s;trum-mongers. <Q>with fewer pains, and &s;oon|er, to the great advantage, and without danger both of woman and child.</Q></P>
<P>HE is not content with having thus acquainted us with the great value of his &s;ecret, and who be|&s;ides him&s;elf are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, in his epi&s;tle, but al&s;o mentions and recommends it over and over, <HI>ad nau&s;eam u&s;que,</HI> through the whole of his remarks on this work, for fear the Midwomen &s;hould at|tend Mr. Mauriceau &s;o much, that they &s;hould for|get his <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> E. G. Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 176. <Q>If there be any ca&s;e, wherein a Surgeon ought to make the greate&s;t reflection, and u&s;e mo&s;t precaution in his art, it is this; to know whether the infant be alive or dead?</Q> Dr. Cham|berlen remarks, <Q>This caution is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e practitoners which can fetch a child coming right, or with the Arm, without hooks or &s;harp in&s;truments, as the tran&s;lator of this book, and his father, and his brothers can.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Chapman in his e&s;&s;ay on Midwifery, 1733. &s;ays, Dr. Chamberlen's &s;ecret was the Forceps. Then makes the following quaint ob&s;ervation on the fore-mentioned remark: <Q>Here is &s;ome|thing very odd methinks, in applying this &s;ecret to both the&s;e ca&s;es, as equally &s;ervice|able to either, the ca&s;es differing &s;o very

<P>WHENCE its evident, Mr. Chapman did not apprehend the Doctor's view in applying his &s;ecret to the arm as well as the head.

<P>DR.

Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 195. &s;ays, <Q>It is always better of two evils to choo&s;e the lea&s;t, &s;o we ought always to pre|fer the mother's life before the child's.</Q> Dr. Chamberlen, <Q>This chapter might be very well &s;pared, if every practitioner had the art the tran&s;lator profe&s;&s;eth in his epi&s;tle, of fetching a child, when it comes right, without hooks, or turning it.</Q></P>
<P>IF turning will do, there is never any occa&s;ion for hooks, or for his &s;ecret either. Thus you &s;ee
<PB N="14" REF="19">with what ful&s;ome repetitions, what nau&s;eous re|commendations of his No&s;trum, he has &s;tuffed his remarks; but has not made one remark, that can be of any advantage to our Midwomen; and &s;eems to have had nothing elf&s;e in view through the whole, but to tell them when they ought to &s;end for him, and to let them know, that he, &amp;c. could &s;erve them better than any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>OUR tran&s;lator, like all the re&s;t of the Secret|mongers, has given a better character of his No|&s;trum, than I fancy it de&s;erves. E. G. He has taken a great deal of pains, and u&s;ed all his art to per&s;uade us, that he, &amp;c. can fetch a child, which pre&s;ents right, at all times, and in all circum&s;tances, without hooks, or turning, &amp;c. but how this qua|drates with the two following ca&s;es, (one of which is tran&s;lated by the Doctor him&s;elf, and the other is recorded in Mr. Mauriceau's 26th ob&s;ervation,) I leave the reader to judge.</P>
<P>MR. Mauriceau, pag, 198. tells us, that <Q>in the year 1660, while he practi&s;ed Midwifery in the Hotel Dieu, one of the Deputies had a wo|man who&s;e Child &s;he could not po&s;ibly bring forth further than its head; therefore called the head Midwife to her aid; who likewi&s;e u&s;ed her utmo&s;t &s;kill but in vain: And when they had both thus tir'd them&s;elves in pulling the head, I came in accidentally, and they de&s;ired me to examine, and find the cau&s;e why the child could not be drawn forth with all their &s;trength, which was &s;ufficient to have drawn forth the &s;houlders, if they had been as big again as they were; which having con&s;idered, I immediately
<PB N="15" REF="20">conceived the difficulty to proceed from &s;ome|thing el&s;e: I then put my hand into the womb, up to the child's &s;houlders, which &s;eemed &s;mall enough to pa&s;s with ea&s;e, therefore I concluded that the hindrance was not there.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After that, I put my hand farther up to|wards it's belly, which I found very much &s;wel|led by a drop&s;y. I therefore told them that it was impo&s;&s;ible ever to deliver the woman, until the water was emptied by piercing the belly: But not having a Crotchet in my pocket, I &s;ent to another Surgeon of the &s;ame ho&s;pital, and told him the &s;tory, adding withal that the child could not be born, unle&s;s an orifice was made to empty the belly: but he would not take my advice, imagining he could extract it with his hands; but he &s;oon &s;eparated the head from the &s;houlders, the Midwives having almo&s;t done it before. Afterwards he fell to work with his Crotchet, and in about three quarters of an hour brought away both arms, &s;everal ribs, heart, and lungs, and tired him&s;elf heartily, yet in all this time, he had never opened the Diaphragma, nor Abdomen, which I advi&s;ed him to do every moment, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible to draw forth the re&s;t of the body. Then he gave me the Crotchet, telling me I might weary my|&s;elf as well as he had done; which I willingly accepted, knowing very well, that in&s;tead of amu&s;ing my&s;elf, as they had done, by pulling it, I ought only to pierce the infant's belly to let out the waters, after which all the re&s;t would ea&s;ily follow. I then introduced my left hand as far
<PB N="16" REF="21">as the &s;ide of the infant's belly, and then with my right guided the Crotchet upon it, to the &s;ame place, then turned its point, and &s;truck it into the infant's belly, &s;o that I made a hole big enough to receive the ends of my two fingers, with which I &s;tretched the orifice, and the wa|ters gu&s;hed out, &s;o that with one hand I ea&s;ily drew out the re&s;t of the body, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of this Surgeon, whom I could never per&s;uade that the infant was &s;o full of the drop&s;y. I filled the belly afterwards, through the hole I had made, and it held about five quarts. I have &s;et down this &s;tory, that other Surgeons may know how to behave on the like occa|&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>PRAY what could Dr. Chamberlen have done with his Forceps in this ca&s;e? But the following &s;tory will more clearly &s;hew, that he him&s;elf has been foiled, SECRET AND ALL.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. Mauriceau's ob&s;ervation xxvi.</HEAD>
<P><Q>Of a woman who died with her child in her womb, which could not be extracted by an Engli&s;h Phy&s;ician who undertook to deliver her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ON the 19th of Augu&s;t, 1670. I vi&s;ited a little woman, about thirty-eight years of age, who had been in labour of her fir&s;t child for four days, the membranes being broke the fir&s;t day of her illne&s;s, and yet there was hardly any dilatation of the mouth of the womb. I ordered
<PB N="17" REF="22">her to be blooded, and in ca&s;e that did not encrea&s;e her pains, to give her a decoction of Senna, in order to excite them; which &s;ucceed|ed &s;o well, that next day the womb was &s;uffi|ciently dilated. Neverthele&s;s, it was nor po&s;&s;i|ble to deliver her. The infant pre&s;ented it's head, but could not advance into the pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e of the &s;traitne&s;s and bad formation of the bones of the Pelvis, which made it impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to introduce my hand tho' I have a very &s;mall one, or any other in&s;trument where|with I could deliver her. I therefore declared to the good women, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to deliver her at all, except by the Cae&s;arian &s;ection, which I did not care to meddle with, &amp;c. But &s;oon after I left her, there was an Engli&s;h Phy|&s;ician, named CHAMBERLEN, recommended by &s;omebody to vi&s;it her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN he came and heard how it was, and what had pa&s;&s;ed, he &s;eemed exceedingly &s;ur|prized that a Man of &s;o much experience, as I was reputed to have, could not deliver her; yet, for all that, he a&s;&s;ured them, that he would deliver her in le&s;s than half a quarter of an hour, let the diffi|culty be what it would: Accordingly he &s;et a|bout the work, but in&s;tead of fini&s;hing it in half a quarter of an hour, as he had promi&s;ed, he worked above three hours, (SECRET AND ALL) without any intermi&s;&s;ion, except to breath a little now and then. And at la&s;t, having &s;pent, to no purpo&s;e both his &s;trength and art, and &s;eeing the poor woman ready to expire in his hands, he was obliged to give it up, and
<PB N="18" REF="23">declared al&s;o, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to deliver her. The poor woman died with her child in her belly about twenty-four hours after he left her: Upon opening the body, I found the womb pierced and tore in &s;everal places, by the in&s;truments that Phy&s;ician had blind|ly u&s;ed without the guidance of his hand, which being much larger than mine could not be introduced. Neverthele&s;s this Phy&s;i|cian had come from England to Paris, about &s;ix months before, in hopes of making his for|tune. He gave it out that he had a particular &s;ecret for delivering children when the head pre|&s;ented; and bragg'd that he could lay the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and dangerous in half a quarter of an hour. Nay, he had even propo&s;ed to the king's fir&s;t phy&s;ician, that if he would give him 10000. crowns he would di&s;cover his &s;e|cret. But the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the fore-mentioned ca&s;e put him &s;o much out of humour, that he returned a few days afterwards to England.</Q></P>
<P>DOES not this &s;tory &s;hew how little dependance there is upon &s;ecrets, tho' never &s;o po&s;itively re|commended? Does not this &s;hew how cautious people ought to be in believing of them? Does not this &s;hew, that, tho' they may be really u&s;e|ful in &s;ome ca&s;es, yet they are not &s;o in all, as they commonly pretend?</P>
<P>PREFACE. <Q>I &s;hall now take leave to offer an apology for not publi&s;hing the &s;ecret I men|tion we have to extract children without hooks, where other arti&s;ts u&s;e them, viz. there being my father and two brothers living, that practi&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="24">this art, I cannot e&s;teem it my own to di&s;po&s;e of,</Q> <HI>(a pretty and rea&s;onable excu&s;e indeed!)</HI> "nor publi&s;h it without injury to them; <HI>(but there was not a word of this when he was bargaining with the French king's fir&s;t Phy&s;ician,)</HI><Q>and think I have not been un&s;erviceable to my country, altho' I do but inform them that the fore-mentioned three per&s;ons of our family, and my&s;elf, can &s;erve them in the&s;e extremities, with greater &s;afety than others.</Q></P>
<P>IF Ward's Pill, or any other quack medicine, was found by experience, to be generally of u&s;e in this, that, or t'other di&s;ea&s;e, it may be &s;ent with proper directions, to all parts of the kingdom; &s;o that the mo&s;t di&s;tant inhabitants would have almo&s;t the &s;ame benefit of it, with tho&s;e among whom Mr. Ward lived; and con&s;equently Mr. Ward might very ju&s;tly &s;ay, that (notwith&s;tanding he would not di&s;cover what his medicine was com|po&s;ed of, becau&s;e it would be worth &s;o much year|ly to him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,) yet his country was obliged to him, for telling them where they might purcha&s;e &s;o beneficial a remedy.</P>
<P>BUT how few in the whole community could be the better for all the manual operations in Mid|wifery, four Men could perform? Can four Men deliver all the good women in England, who want their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;ing they were to ride po&s;t night and day after them? Is there any proportion between the benefit the publick would receive from the quack medicines, and the &s;ecret manual opera|tions of four Men? What &s;ervice is it then to the country in general, for the Doctor to tell them,
<PB N="20" REF="25">that he and three others can &s;erve them with great|er &s;afety than other Men?</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS I'm far from thinking, that the publick has any right to expect, that every private Man (who, at a con&s;iderable expence, and a&s;&s;iduous &s;tudy, makes any con&s;iderable di&s;covery in manual operations, which cannot be made uni|ver&s;ally u&s;eful, as medicines may, and really are, except they are fully and di&s;tinctly explained,) &s;hould always communicate <HI>Gratis</HI> the fruits of his labour and expence. No! they ought to be hand|&s;omely rewarded, not only for the real &s;ervice they have done, but to encourage indu&s;try in others.</P>
<P>BUT the Doctor offered to di&s;cover this &s;ecret to the French for ten thou&s;and crowns; pray why did he not make the &s;ame offer to his country? Had not his country better have given each of them ten thou&s;and crowns, than expo&s;ed &s;o many thou|&s;ands of beautiful women, and innocent children, to the danger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> hooks, &s;harp in&s;truments, &amp;c. the Doctor exclaims &s;o much again&s;t? Surely yes.</P>
<P>Dr. Chamberlen. pag. 221. &s;ays, <Q>The Author, viz. Mauriceau,) you &s;ee was only a Surgeon.</Q> Pray what would he have him be? a Doctor, an Apothecary, or what? Are not the&s;e operations merely chirurgical? who then can be &s;o fit to per|form them as Surgeons? Are not the <HI>Superioris &s;ortis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters">i,</HI> who never delivered one of them, as capable of directing for them, both before and after delivery, as any Doctor or Apothecary who had laid &s;everal? No doubt of it! they are much more capable! and it's very &s;urprizing they don't a&s;&s;ert their own right, and ours? What then can
<PB N="21" REF="26">Dr. Chamberlen mean by this &s;neer, this &s;arca&s;m? E&s;pecially when Mr. Mauriceau is then talking as much to the purpo&s;e, as ever he, or any body el&s;e did, on that &s;ubject, viz. that when a woman has a violent flooding, &amp;c. the be&s;t way to &s;erve her, is to deliver her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, whether at full time or no? Prove the contrary who can.</P>
<P>IN pag. 172. he explains him&s;elf a little more plainly. Mr. Mauriceau &s;ays, <Q>A Surgeon ought always to endeavour to bring the chil|dren alive.</Q> Upon which the Doctor makes the following mo&s;t in&s;olent remark, <Q>And therefore undertake what he can &s;afely perform, and what he cannot, leave to others that may,</Q> (pray who be they, Doctors, Apothecaries, Sha|vers, or No&s;trum-Mongers?) <Q>for life is not to be played with.</Q></P>
<P>IS not the good which Surgeons do their patients as evident as the Sun? E. G. When they cut for the &s;tone, when they perforate the &s;cull, reduce a luxa|tion, &amp;c. neither of which can be affected only by the &s;trength of nature. But as the learned and hone&s;t BAGLIVI frankly owns, <Q>It's often doubtful whether the cure, &s;uppo&s;ed to be performed even by Phy&s;i|cians of the fir&s;t rank, was mo&s;tly owing to na|ture, or the medicines, &amp;c. which they directed.</Q> E.G. "In fevers, &s;mall pox, con&s;umptions, &amp;c." What ground had he then to charge the Surgeons with playing with life? The Doctor owns, pag. 14. <Q>That Surgeons only practi&s;e Midwi&s;ery in France;</Q> and &s;o they do, or ought to do, every where el&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT how far the Doctor went out of his own ken, when he talked to Surgeons in &s;uch a magi|&s;terial
<PB N="22" REF="27">and dictatorial way, in matters merely chi|rurgical, the three following ca&s;es will evidently demon&s;trate. Ca&s;e 1. Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 344. &s;ays, <Q>That children's gums ought to be cut with a Lancet, tho' Nur&s;es &s;ometimes do it with their Nails.</Q> Yet our commentator &s;ays, <Q>A thin groat <HI>(a &s;mall piece of &s;ilver)</HI> is as good or better than either.</Q> Whence it's evident, our tran&s;lator was only a Doctor. Notwith&s;tanding he takes upon him to direct the Surgeons in &s;uch an imperious and dictatorial way; yet in this ob&s;erva|tion, he betrays him&s;elf, and plainly &s;hews, he did not under&s;tand this very little part of Surgery, even &s;o well as the very Nur&s;es. The method he propo&s;es is &s;o far from being better than Mauri|ceau's, he takes upon him &s;o freely and publickly to correct, that it is wor&s;e than that u&s;ed by the old women, as will appear at &s;ight, to every pro|per judge. Ca&s;e 2. Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 227. &s;ays, When by the fir&s;t fa&s;tning of the Crotchet, <Q>the head is drawn a little lower, you may loo&s;en it out of the fir&s;t place, to fa&s;ten it further up, that &s;tronger hold may be taken and &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively removing and fa&s;tening of it till the head is quite born, &amp;c. Dr. Chamberlen, "This is needle&s;s and dangerous, in ca&s;e Crotchets be u&s;ed, unle&s;s they lo&s;e their hold.</Q></P>
<P>CAN any thing expo&s;e a Man's judgment more than finding fault in the wrong place? Would not this remark convince any Man that he had never u&s;ed a Crotchet, nay, that he did not know how to u&s;e it? The Doctor him&s;elf allows, that Crotchets are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome ca&s;es, and con&s;idering
<PB N="23" REF="28">his large &s;hare of practice, it's impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome of the&s;e very ca&s;es mu&s;t fall in his way. Pray what did he do then? Did he u&s;e the Crotchet him&s;elf? or did he &s;end for a Surgeon to u&s;e it for him? Ca&s;e 3. Of a violent Flooding. Mr. Mauri|ceau, pag. 89. <Q>The woman being put into a proper po&s;ture, the Surgeon having well grea&s;ed his hand, introduces the end of his fingers into the mouth of the womb, then opens them gent|ly to dilate it,</Q> (i. e. by little and little, with|out either great violence or hurry,) <Q>wide enough to admit his whole hand; then, if the mem|branes are not broke, let him break them; then, tho' the Head pre&s;ents, let him &s;earch for the feet, and draw it forth by them, becau&s;e there is bet|ter hold, and more ea&s;y to deliver by them, than by the head, or any other part of the body.</Q> Dr. Chamberlen, <Q>Without it could be done without hooks, as mentioned in the preface of the tran&s;lator.</Q></P>
<P>IF this is not puzzling the cau&s;e, if this is not amu&s;ing and confounding people in&s;tead of in&s;tructing them, pray what can be called &s;o? Is not bringing the child out by the feet, as Mr. Mauriceau directs, bringing it out without hooks? Be&s;ides, don't every body know, that it may be quicker brought away by the feet than by the head; and that the &s;ooner the woman is deli|vered, the &s;ooner the flooding will &s;top? Is not this making good, bad? Is not this finding fault where there is none? Don't this prove that Mr. Mauriceau was a good and faithful Surgeon, and that Chamberlen was only a &mdash; Doctor.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="29">
<P>THUS, upon the whole, I think it's evident, that Dr. Chamberlen's main de&s;ign, in his preface, and notes upon Mr. Mauriceau's book, was to puz|zle, rather than in&s;truct the Midwomen or Mid|men, to per&s;uade them, that he, and the re&s;t of the No&s;trum-mongers, could &s;erve them better than any other arti&s;ts; and to repre&s;ent Phy&s;icians, tho' unacquainted with almo&s;t every other part of Surgery, as fitter per&s;ons to deliver women in la|bour than Surgeons, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 1734. Dr. HODY publi&s;hed 225 Ca&s;es in Mid|wifery, written &s;ome years before by the late in|genious and experienced Mr. WILLIAM GIF|FARD, Surgeon and Man-midwife. In which he has given the following account of the IGNO|RANCE of the Midwomen, and its fatal con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>CASE I. <Q>I Was fetched to the wife of a chair|man, and found one arm of the child &s;unk down without the outer orifice, and the &s;houlder and &s;ide &s;o engaged, and &s;unk &s;o low, that I could neither return the arm, nor with all my &s;trength move the other parts to fetch it by the feet. Another Man-midwife &mdash; had been there before me, who at fir&s;t would not attempt any thing without a &s;um of money was laid down; <HI>(a great piece of inhu|manity too many are guilty of,)</HI> but upon a&s;&s;u|rances that he &s;hould be paid, he worked upon the poor woman, and left her in a wor&s;e con|dition than he found her. (Thus you &s;ee Mid|men
<PB N="25" REF="30">are not all witches any more than the Midwomen.) However this was the &s;tate I found her in, which gave me occa&s;ion to re|primand the Midwife, telling her &s;he had not &s;ent for help in time, and not till &s;he had work|ed upon her, which had occa&s;ioned tho&s;e parts to be funk &s;o low, and &s;o &s;trongly engaged, that I could neither return the arm, nor pa&s;s my hand (the whole pa&s;&s;age being &s;topped up on every &s;ide) to fetch it by the feet; which might have been very ea&s;ily done had I been &s;ent for in time. The ca&s;e being &s;o de&s;perate at fir&s;t, I was at a lo&s;s where to begin: Her pul&s;e was very languid and low, and &s;he was in cold &s;weats, &s;o that I fear'd &s;he would die un|der the fatigue and pain &s;he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity undergo. Then he twi&s;ted off the arm, and with great difficulty extracted the re&s;t, of the infant with his Crotchet; yet after all this woman recovered.</Q> Q. 1. Whether one in fifty recovers after &s;uch a job? Q. 2. Whether this bad po&s;ture of the child, the great &s;uffer|ing and danger of the mother, might not have been prevented, nay, and the child's life &s;aved, had a &s;kilful Midwoman attended?</P>
<P>Case II. <Q>The child was born dead, which is generally the fate of tho&s;e children who&s;e Placenta offers fir&s;t,</Q> (Madam du Tertre, head Midwoman in the H&ocirc;tel Dieu at PARIS, and Au|thor of one of the be&s;t books on this &s;ubject, pub|li&s;hed in 1677. &s;ays, the Placenta offering before the child, is the mo&s;t certain &s;ign of its being
<PB N="26" REF="31">dead,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Entre les &s;ignes qui nous font connoi&s;tre que l'enfant e&s;t mort, le plus certain e&s;t lor&s;que l'arriere-fais e&s;t &s;orty avant luy. <BIBL><HI>In&s;truction familiere, &amp;c.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>) <Q>if a proper per&s;on be not at hand to de|liver them immediately.</Q> Who can be &s;o pro|per, who is &s;o likely to be in the way as a &s;kil|ful Midwoman? But as long as they want &s;kill to perform it, the child mu&s;t die before a Midman can be brought.</P>
<P>CASE III. <Q>The Midwife informed me, that the navel-&s;tring was thru&s;t into the Vagina, be|yond the Os internum, but could not inform me what other part pre&s;ented. Many Mid|wives are ignorant of the method of TOUCHING, which oftentimes occa&s;ions very great misfor|tunes both to mother and infant, and &s;ometimes is the death of both, but mo&s;t commonly of the child <HI>(Is not de&s;troying one bad enough?)</HI> which being for &s;ome time engaged in a wrong po&s;ture, and the waters gone off, the Uterus is &s;o collap&s;ed, it gives great trouble to the opera|tor, much more pain to the mother, and very often, as I &s;aid before, occa&s;ions the death of the infant; all which may be prevented if a &s;kilful operator is &s;ent for in time.</Q> But much better, if a &s;kilful operatrix attended.</P>
<P>CASE IV. <Q>I vi&s;ited a woman who had been &s;ome days in labour, and the Midwife affirmed that the waters run off the preceding day, and that &s;he thought a foot pre&s;ented, but upon my touching I found it to be the hand bent back|wards
<PB N="27" REF="32">wards in the pa&s;&s;age, and protruded out of the inner orifice up to the &s;houlder.</Q></P>
<P>CASE V. <Q>The Midwife told me that one hand and the arm was &s;liped down into the Va|gina, and that it had laid &s;o for &s;ome hours, and the waters, &s;he &s;aid, were gone of &s;everal hours before the hand was protruded. I rebuk|ed her (as he very well might) for not &s;ending &s;ooner; &s;he alledged, for excu&s;e, that her labour might have &s;ucceeded in time: Then I told her that it was impo&s;&s;ible, in the po&s;ture the child pre&s;ented, it could ever be born.</Q></P>
<P>CASE VI. <Q>The Midwife told me, that one child had been born, and another remained be|hind, that the membranes, with the waters, pre&s;|&s;ed forwards, and were very tight at every pain; but the woman having flooded very much after the birth of the fir&s;t child, the Midwife could not tell me what part of the &s;econd pre|&s;ented. I Blamed the Midwife for not &s;ending for me &s;ooner, &amp;c. Whereupon I pa&s;&s;ed up my hand, and found the membranes much extend|ed with the waters, and the legs of the infant (which the Midwife knew nothing of, not knowing how to touch) pre&s;&s;ed forward into the Vagina.</Q></P>
<P>CASE VII. <Q>Upon examining the Midwife, at my fir&s;t coming, how the child pre&s;ented, &s;he an&s;wer'd, &amp;c. This convinced me of the Mid|wife's ignorance in the method and knowledge of touching, and I could wi&s;h it was not too common. I have generally found them igno|rant in this point, which often occa&s;ions the
<PB N="28" REF="33">death both of Mother and infant,</Q> (Why did not he do his endeavour to amend this great evil? What &s;ignifies finding fault with them in every page without attempting a remedy?) <Q>and gives a great deal of pain to the Man-midwife.</Q></P>
<P>CASE VIII. <Q>I was &s;ent for to a woman, who&s;e child was brought out to the &s;houlders, where it had &s;tuck for about three hours; the Midwife not knowing how to draw out the arms and the head. They had al&s;o &s;ent for ano|ther Midwife before I got there, but &s;he knew not how to extricate the child out of this &s;nare. Then I extracted it, but the child was dead, which could not otherwi&s;e be expected, &s;ince it had been &s;o long held in that po&s;ture.</Q></P>
<P>CASE IX. <Q>I fir&s;t enquired of the Midwife, how matters &s;tood in general, but &s;he giving me no &s;atisfactory account, I de&s;cended to particu|lars. I then a&s;ked her if the membranes were broke, and if &s;o, how long before; to which &s;he could not give a ready an&s;wer, &s;o that I found her thoroughly Ignorant. I next enquired how long the navel-&s;tring had been fallen down; Her an&s;wer was, &s;everal hours. I told her, i. e. rebuked her, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>CASE X. <Q>I was &s;ent for to a per&s;on, who&s;e child was born, and the Placenta left behind. Upon my coming there, the Midwife told me that &s;he had attempted, by all methods &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of, to fetch it, but could not &s;ucceed: Wherefore, con&s;idering the length of time, from the bringing of the Foetus to my coming, I thought no more time ought to be lo&s;t; and immediate|ly
<PB N="29" REF="34">put up my hand, and found the inner orifice &s;o much contracted, that at fir&s;t I could &s;carce pa&s;s up the ends of my two fore-fingers, but af|ter &s;ome time I dilated it &s;o much, that I was able to pa&s;s my hand, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This Ca&s;e will &s;hew us, what difficulties people often fall into from the Ignorance of the Midwife, in not knowing how to pa&s;s their hands as &s;oon as the Foetus is protruded.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XI <Q>I found the Scalp was extended and &s;eparated from the Cranium. This I judged to have proceeded from the Midwife's top rudely handling the head.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XII. <Q>The Midwife being very igno|norant, was not able to give me a &s;atisfatory account of the ca&s;e. I found the Labia Pudendi very much &s;well'd, &amp;c. wherefore Irebuked the Midwife, telling her, that when &s;he had done all the mi&s;chief &s;he could, then &s;he per&s;uaded them to &s;end for me: This is a common fault among&s;t them, not being willing to have further help, 'till matters are come to the la&s;t extremity.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XIII. <Q>I thereupon pa&s;&s;ed up my hand into the Vagina, and found the parts &s;omewhat &s;well'd, by the Midwife's too rudely handling them.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XIV. <Q>Upon pa&s;&s;ing my hand, I found the Midwife had been too bu&s;y, for the arm was &s;unk low, and much &s;well'd; not knowing better, &s;he had endeavoured to bring it away in the po&s;ture it pre&s;ented; whereupon I Rebuked her, telling her, that by her &s;o doing
<PB N="30" REF="35">&s;he had made bad work, and &s;hew'd her, that it was almo&s;t <HI>(he might have &s;aid altogether)</HI> impo&s;&s;ible to bring it away in the po&s;ture it came in.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XV. <Q>This ca&s;e &s;hould be a caution to Midwives to &s;end for help in time, when a child comes Footling, and not to venture (unle&s;s they are very &s;kilful) to bring it forwards.</Q> But who&s;e fault is it they are not all very &s;kilful? Why are they &s;uffered to practi&s;e, who are not very &s;kilful? Would not Madam du Tertre have laughed at any Man, who &s;hould have told her, &s;he mu&s;t not venture to bring a child forwards when the feet pre&s;ents? Are not our women as ca|pable of being taught as the French women?</P>
<P>CASE XVI. <Q>I came, and the Midwife be|ing a Novice in her profe&s;&s;ion, was not capable of giving proper directions. She &s;hould have advi&s;ed the labouring woman to have, kept back, as much as po&s;&s;ible, her throws, and not forced downwards, and &s;he ought to have pa&s;&s;ed her hand up, and pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the child's buttocks, to retain it from &s;lipping down, when|ever the pains pre&s;&s;ed forwards;</Q> (<HI>or, which would have been much more to the purpo&s;e, put up her hand, laid hold of the feet, and brought it a|way by them;</HI>) <Q>but the Midwife neglecting to give this advice, or to act in this manner, I found the hip of the infant, with the Scrotum, &s;unk low into the Vagina, and &s;trongly engaged between the bones of the Pelvis, &s;o that I could not move it by any means.</Q></P>
<PB N="31" REF="36">
<P>CASE XVII. <Q>I found things very bad, which in a great mea&s;ure proceded from the Ignorance of the Midwife; I therefore rebuked her for her carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XVIII. <Q>I enquired of the Midwife, if the waters were broke, how long they had been gone off, and what part pre&s;ented; She told me that the waters had been run off &s;ome hours, but what part pre&s;ented &s;he knew not. I &s;oon perceived her Ignorance; for upon pa&s;&s;ing my &s;ingers, I found the membranes protruded by the waters beyond the Os internum, into the Vagina, about the bigne&s;s o&s; a pig's blad|der, &s;o that the waters were not gone off, as &s;he &s;aid, for &s;ome hours, and being Ignorant of the method of touching, it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could tell what part pre&s;ented.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XIX. <Q>I was call'd about &s;ix in the morning, and the Midwife told me, that the Membranes were broke, and the waters flowed off about twelve o'clock at night, and that the fir&s;t part which pre&s;ented was the elbow. I Re|buked her for &s;taying &s;o long before &s;he &s;ent for help, and I &s;oon di&s;covered her Ignorance; for &s;he told me that &s;he had delivered &s;everal children where the arm came fir&s;t, in the &s;ame po&s;ture, and &s;ome were born alive, &amp;c. The child was born dead, which I imagined to pro|ceed from its lying &s;o long in the po&s;ture I found it, and the Midwife's too rudely pulling the arm when it fir&s;t fell into the pa&s;&s;age, in hopes, as &s;he thought, to have brought away the child in the po&s;ture it pre&s;ented. By her
<PB N="32" REF="37">violent pulling &s;he had almo&s;t &s;eparated the arm from the &s;houlder.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS is one among&s;t the Many inconve|niences that occur from the ignorance of Mid|wives: Had I been &s;ent for as &s;oon as the mem|branes were broke, and before the &s;houlder, by reiterated pains, was &s;o &s;trongly locked between the bones of the Pelvis, mo&s;t of my trouble, and the child's life might have been &s;aved.</Q> Undoubtedly! or if &s;he had had &s;kill enough to have done it her&s;elf.</P>
<P>CASE XX. <Q>When I came I found the child protruded to the hips, which hung out beyond the Labia Pudendi, the Midwife told me that the waters run off about an hour before; that the child pre&s;ented with the feet fir&s;t, and that when &s;he had brought it to the buttocks, it &s;tuck there, nor could &s;he bring it any further. I re|buked her for not &s;ending at fir&s;t, when &s;he found it to pre&s;ent in a wrong po&s;ture; but &s;he in excu&s;e, as is u&s;ual among&s;t them, told me, that &s;he had brought out many children offering in that po&s;ture.</Q> (<HI>She mu&s;t indeed have been a very ordinary Midwife if &s;he had not.</HI>) <Q>The child from its having lain &s;ome time &s;o pre&s;&s;ed, was dead, which, I told her, was very probably ow|ing to her neglect, in not &s;ending &s;ooner, when &s;he was &s;atisfied the child pre&s;ented wrong.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXI. <Q>Upon examination of the child's head, I found a Tumour, about the bigne&s;s of a pigeon's egg, on its upper part, ari&s;ing, as I judged, from the Midwife's too rudely hand|ling it, or (<HI>which is much more probable</HI>) it's
<PB N="33" REF="38">lying &s;o long locked between the bones.</Q> But it's their way to haul the Midwomen in, head and &s;houlders, guilty or not guilty.</P>
<P>CASE XXII. <Q>I Rebuked the Midwife for not &s;ending &s;ooner, telling her the danger &s;he had expo&s;ed the poor woman to by her delay: She in excu&s;e, an&s;wered me, that &s;he had never had &s;uch an accident before, altho' &s;he had been a Midwife above eleven years; however I found &s;he was very ignorant.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXIII. <Q>This ca&s;e (viz. the Placenta being le&s;t behind, occa&s;ioned a flooding) &s;hould be a caution to all Midwives not to delay &s;end|ing early, and not depend too far on their own &s;kill and experience; for it's plain this poor woman died a Martyr to either the Midwife's Ignorance, or vain Opinion of her own Self-&s;ufficiency, which too much prevails among&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXIV. <Q>Pa&s;&s;ing my hand into the Vagina, I found the arm bent and broke, by the Midwife's too rudely handling it. The child was born dead, which proceeded, as I judged, from its long lying in &s;o unea&s;y a po&s;ture, and from the Midwife's Ignorance, in not knowing how to keep up the arm, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXV. <Q>Men-midwives frequently find great difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing their hand into the womb, when, from the Ignorance of the Mid|wife, they are obliged to fetch the Placenta after the child has been born &s;ome time, the Os inter|num being upon the&s;e occa&s;ions generally very
<PB N="34" REF="39">much contracted.</Q> Pray is not a Midwoman's hand ea&s;ier pa&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t, than a Midman's at la&s;t.</P>
<P>CASE XXVI. <Q>One foot pre&s;ented; but the Midwife (thinking her&s;elf capable of delivering the woman, being in her own opinion very Self-&s;ufficient, altho' &s;he was very ignorant,) would not at fir&s;t &s;end for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXVII. <Q>As &s;oon as the Midwife found that the hands pre&s;ented, &s;he &s;ent for me. This is what Midwives &s;eldom do;</Q> (<HI>a black &s;wan indeed!</HI>) <Q>tru&s;ting too much to, and depending upon their own Sufficiency, which very often occa|&s;ions the lo&s;s of the child, and &s;ometimes of the mother.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXVIII. <Q>The Midwife's Ignorance, in not knowing how to pa&s;s her hand, occa&s;ion'd this unea&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXIX. <Q>This is one among the many misfortunes that attend a Man-midwife, when he he is &s;ent for too late, proceeding from the neg|ligence, &s;upinene&s;s, ignorance, or &s;elf-&s;ufficiency of the Midwife; which la&s;t prevails in mo&s;t of them, and is very often the occa&s;ion of the lo&s;s either of the mother or child, or &s;ometimes both.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXX. <Q>The Ignorance of the Midwife, in not knowing how to keep up the womb from being forced before the head &s;o low into the Va|gina, was what added &s;o much to my difficulty in delivering this woman.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXXI. <Q>When I came, I found all but the head was protruded beyond the Labia Pudendi, but that &s;tuck above, altho' the Mid|wife
<PB N="35" REF="40">had pulled &s;o &s;trongly, that &s;he had near &s;eparated the body from the head. The Mid|wife, being Ignorant, did not take care to turn the child's face towards the Spine of the mother as the body advanced. However, I brought it out in a minute's time, this &s;urprized all that were pre&s;ent, becau&s;e the Midwife had been working above an hour, without making any advance. Had I been there early, I might very probably have &s;aved the life of the child, but Self-&s;ufficiency, join'd with an idle Notion that they &s;uffer in their character if they &s;end for a Man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, generally prevents mo&s;t Mid|wives from &s;ending early, by which they too often endanger the lives of both mothers and children, and give no &s;mall trouble to the Man|midwife.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXXII. <Q>The Midwife could not fetch the Placenta, for as &s;he was ignorant in the me|thod of pa&s;&s;ing her hand into the Uterus, up to the body of the Placenta, to examine whether it adhered to it, &s;he had only pulled by the end of the &s;tring which hung out, and &s;o had very near broke it clo&s;e to the Placenta; &s;he had made no Ligature upon the end of the &s;tring, therefore a Hemorrhage had en&s;ued, and the woman had lo&s;t a great quantity o&s; blood. Mid|wives very often depend too much upon their own judgment, and think them&s;elves Self-&s;uffi|cient, &s;o that they po&s;tpone &s;ending for help in time, whereby the poor women become Victims to their Ignorance or Self-conceit.</Q></P>
<PB N="36" REF="41">
<P>CASE XXXIIL <Q>The Child's arm pre&s;ented &s;everal hours before I was &s;ent for; upon which I rebuked the Midwife for not &s;ending &s;ooner; but &s;he, to ju&s;tify her&s;elf, had the A&s;&s;urance to to tell me, that &s;he had brought out &s;everal children pre&s;enting in that manner; whereupon I &s;hewed her the impo&s;&s;ibility of it, and advi&s;ed her for the future always to &s;end for help, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould find the hand to pre&s;ent fir&s;t, and not, by pulling the hand, draw it further down, and engage the &s;houlder in the pa&s;&s;age, as &s;he had now done.</Q> Pray would it not have been much more &s;ea&s;onable advice to have &s;hewn her how to pa&s;s her hand, and get hold of the feet, &amp;c.</P>
<P>CASE XXXIV. <Q>The Nur&s;e came and told me the child was born, but the Midwife was &s;oiled in her attempts to fetch away the Placenta. I went, and found the Midwife was both igno|rant of the cau&s;e of its being retained, and the method of pa&s;&s;ing the hand to extract it; yet I brought it away whole in le&s;s than half a mi|nute's time, which much &s;urprized both the wo|man and the by-&s;tanders, the Midwife having &s;pent &s;o much time without being able to effect it.</Q> Sometimes a Man gets more credit by do|ing nothing than by a difficult operation!</P>
<P>CASE XXXV. <Q>The Man-midwife's being &s;ent for &s;o late, too often proceeds from the Igno|rance or Self-&s;ufficiency of the Midwife, (<HI>but oftener from the mode&s;ty of the women, covetou&s;ne&s;s, or real poverty of the men, &amp;c.</HI>) who either not knowing how to behave in difficult ca&s;es,
<PB N="37" REF="42">or fearing &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer in her character &s;hould &s;he de&s;ire a&s;&s;i&s;tance, puts off the calling in of a Man-midwife to the la&s;t extremity, &s;o that the mother and child too often become vic|tims either to her negligence or ignorance.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXXVI. <Q>The Midwife depending upon her own Sufficiency, (altho' &s;he was very ignorant) had let the child advance too far, without taking care to turn and bring the face backwards towards the Os Sacrum, and had for &s;ome time endeavoured to bring out the head, but to no purpo&s;e; wherefore I was at la&s;t &s;ent for, and found the parts very dry, and &s;ome|what &s;welled, by the rude Handling of the Midwife.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXXVII. <Q>The woman had been in labour forty-eight hours; the Midwife being very Ignorant, could neither tell me how the Child pre&s;ented, nor at what time the mem|branes broke, but an&s;wered me, according to her dialect, that it was a dry labour.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXXVIII. <Q>The child was brought into the world all but the head, where it had &s;tuck two or three hours before I came; the Midwife being very Ignorant, was not able to do the bu&s;ine&s;s her&s;elf, nor would &s;he &s;end for a&s;&s;i|&s;tance in time, &s;o that the child was lo&s;t, and the mother narrowly e&s;caped.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XXXIX. <Q>The Midwife, in attempt|ing to bring away the Placenta, had inverted the Uterus, for I found the whole body of the Uterus, with the Placenta, adhering to it's Fun|dus, hanging out beyond the Labia Pudendi;
<PB N="38" REF="43">I Rebuked the Midwife for not &s;ending &s;ooner, and told her, that &s;he, thro' her Igno|rance, was the immediate cau&s;e of this woman's death. Before I examined her, the Midwife told me, that the Placenta was partly brought out, being ignorant that &s;he had al&s;o pulled out the womb, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XL. <Q>But the Midwife by pulling the Navel-&s;tring too rudely, had broke it off near the Placenta, which was left in the womb. As &s;oon as I came, I pa&s;&s;ed up my hand, where I found the Placenta entirely &s;eparated from the Uterus, and partly protruded into the Vagina, &s;o that I readily brought it away, and in &s;o &s;hort a time, that the people that were pre&s;ent were greatly &s;urprized. Had the Midwife under|&s;tood how to have pa&s;&s;ed her hand, &s;he might ea&s;ily have brought away the burden before; and for want of this knowledge, &s;ome women fall into violent floodings, whence faintings, convul&s;ions, and death.</Q> A wonderful opera|tion indeed! But does &s;he de&s;erve the Name of a Midwoman who could not have extracted it as quick as he?</P>
<P>CASE XLI. <Q>Had I been &s;ent for before the membranes were broke, the waters pa&s;&s;ed off, the arm &s;lipped down, and the back part of the &s;houlder &s;o rivetted, I might not only have pre|&s;erved the Child, but prevented the Mother's &s;uffering &s;o much pain, and have likewi&s;e &s;aved my&s;elf much fatigue and trouble.</Q> Without doubt!</P>
<PB N="39" REF="44">
<P>IT'S too true, that many Midwives are Igno|rant "of the method of touching," (<HI>and it's as true they might with very little trouble be taught;</HI>) <Q>and therefore are incapable of judging in what man|ner the Child pre&s;ents, until an arm, or &s;ome other part is protruded into the Vagina, which is often &s;o locked between the bones of the Pel|vis, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to remove it; and too often they depend &s;o much upon their own &s;ufficiency, and delay &s;ending for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in time, that both the mother and child, but more frequently the latter, die martyrs to their pre|&s;umption.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XLII. <Q>I was &s;ent for about two in the morning, the Midwife had delivered the Child about &s;ix the evening before, but not be|ing able, notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours, to bring away the Placenta, &s;he at la&s;t left the woman, telling her, that it would in time come away, and that &s;he had known it retained four|teen days without any inconveniency; but as this was a doctrine I was a &s;tranger to, and be|ing on the contrary well &s;atisfied that inconve|niencies might attend, &s;hould it not be &s;peedily drawn away; therefore &mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>CASE XLIII. <Q>The child's arm was &s;lipped out into the Vagina, which, as &s;oon as the Mid|wife ob&s;erved, who was fir&s;t &s;ent for, &s;he pro|po&s;ed that a Man-midwife &s;hould be &s;ent for, telling tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent, that it was not a Midwife's bu&s;ine&s;s; whereupon another Midwife was &s;ent for, who pretended to do the work of a Man-midwife, and at fir&s;t gave them a&s;&s;urances
<PB N="40" REF="45">that &s;he would deliver her, but after &s;he had worked upon her for half an hour, or longer, puting her into &s;everal po&s;tures, as kneeling, &s;tanding, &amp;c. &s;he left her in a much wor&s;e con|dition than &s;he found her; for being ignorant of the method of delivery, when a child offered in the manner this did, &s;he truly had endeavoured to draw the child forward in the &s;ame po&s;ture it pre&s;ented, whereby &s;he had drawn the hand out, and part of the arm, beyond the Labia Pudendi, and almo&s;t &s;eparated it at the &s;houlder. The temerity, joined to the ignorance of this Mid|wife, very much encrea&s;ed the difficulty of lay|ing her. If I had been &s;ent for in time, I might with much more ea&s;e have delivered the woman, and withal have &s;aved the Child. I have meet with &s;ome Midwives, who have had the igno|rance and a&s;&s;urance to tell me, that they have deliver'd children thus pre&s;enting, without turn|ing and bringing them by the feet.</Q></P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this formal declaration, &amp;c. I'm afraid his greate&s;t Aim will appear to be much the &s;ame with Dr. Chamberlen's, viz. to tell the Midwomen when, and in what particular ca&s;es, to &s;end for his &s;uperior advice; and not to in&s;truct them how to give better advice them&s;elves.</P>
<P><Q>I have met with &s;everal Midwives, e&s;pe|cially in this Metropolis, that are extremely well qualified. However, (<HI>well or ill qualified</HI>) I mu&s;t beg leave to give them this one piece of advice, viz. That where any material difficulty occurs, they would readily, and in time, call in our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; as when a child pre&s;ents with it's head, but does not, with a proper degree of pain, fall any lower; when the po&s;ture happens to be wrong, and con&s;equently the child requires turning;</Q> (<HI>May not the po&s;ture be wrong, and yet not want turning?</HI> E. G. <HI>when the fect or hips pre|&s;ent. May not the po&s;ture be wrong, and the
<PB N="43" REF="48">Midwoman as able to turn it as any Midman?</HI>) <Q>but more e&s;pecially that they would not delay to &s;end for a Man in ca&s;e of Floodings, or other threat|ning Symptoms.</Q></P>
<P>PRAY can this be called in&s;tructing them faith|fully, as he propo&s;es in his Exordium? or telling them when to &s;end for &s;uperior advice? Is it not plainly, declaring, as the Doctor had done be|fore, that in his opinion, they know no more of the matter, than to receive a Child which comes away, as it were of it&s;elf, without any the lea&s;t diffi|culty? Would he not, had he de&s;igned to have in|&s;tructed them Faithfully how to give better a&s;&s;i|&s;tance them&s;elves, explained to them, how, and after what manner, to remove all the&s;e difficulties, and threatning Symptoms he &s;uppo&s;es, in&s;tead of only telling them to &s;end &s;peedily for &s;uperior advice? But pray what are the poor Midwo|men to do in places where no &s;uperior advice, i. e. no Midmen, are to be had? He has made no provi&s;ion for them, as Dr. Chamberlen did, pag. 5.</P>
<P>AFTER giving his directions when he thinks they &s;hould &s;end for &s;uperior advice, he fir&s;t coaxes, and then threatens them, as the Doctor did above.</P>
<P><Q>I believe this advice will not be thought im|pertinent by the mo&s;t experienced Midwives, who, by the by, I have ever found mo&s;t ready to call in farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and indeed they find their account in it; whil&s;t it is quite other|wi&s;e with tho&s;e, who, from too great an opinion of their own judgment and abilities, run great
<PB N="44" REF="49">hazards, or at the be&s;t call us in too late, and &s;o lo&s;e their good name, and ju&s;tly &s;uffer in their reputation.

Pray would not the &s;uffering Fair have been much more obliged to her Midwoman, if &s;he had performed the work her&s;elf, and thereby &s;aved her both the unea&s;ine&s;s and expence of &s;uperior advice?</P>

<P>WAS there ever &s;uch an excu&s;e heard of? Be|cau&s;e the Great Dr. Chamberlen acted a very un|generous part in this affair, therefore Mr. Chap|man mu&s;t be excu&s;ed for doing ju&s;t the &s;ame thing.

E. G. I vi&s;ited a woman, who had been many hours in labour, the head of the child lay in the Vagina, &s;o low in the pains, that the un&s;kilful Midwife, (who had never touched the mouth of the womb, which lay more than ordi|nary backwards) had given hopes of delivery the very next pain. Here I did no more than
<PB N="47" REF="52">with my finger dilate and ca&s;t the part (viz. the mouth of the womb) back, and &s;o in a few mi|nutes opened the door, and relea&s;ed the little pri&s;oner.</Q> Pray would not Madam du Tertre's finger have relea&s;ed the pri&s;oner as &s;oon and as &s;afely as his did? That there has been great difficulties oc|ca&s;ioned by the lothne&s;s of the mouth of the womb to open, viz. in elderly women, when callous, &s;chirrous, &amp;c. no Man will will deny. But there is not the lea&s;t &s;ign of any difficulty or lothne&s;s of the mouth of the womb to open, in this ca&s;e Mr. Chapman brings, to prove that the pains may be &s;trong and true, &amp;c. and yet the mouth of the womb, loth as it were to open, &s;hall be very little dilated. The difficulty in his ca&s;e con&s;i&s;ted only in the unnatural &s;ituation of the Os Tincae, which prevented the head's pre&s;&s;ing directly on it, other|wi&s;e it would have opened with all imaginable ea&s;e and &s;peed; as you &s;ee it did when he touched it with his finger.</P>

<P>I very readily agree with the Doctor, that practitioners in Midwifery &s;hould con&s;ult together, when any thing very difficult or dangerous occurs, with the &s;ame freedom and unre&s;ervedne&s;s as in other ca&s;es of Surgery, viz.

<P>CAN he be a tolerable judge of diction him&s;elf, who &s;uffers his friend to write Woman-Midwife, Women-Midwives, &amp;c. Words u&s;ed by no body, except the learned Dr. Maubray, who Mr. Chap|man or his Corrector calls, <Q>that ingenious and laborious author.</Q> But to give a &s;pecimen, <HI>fir&s;t;,</HI> of his Ingenuity: he begins a large book, which he calls the whole art of Midwifery, &amp;c. Thus, Sect. I. cap. 1. Of God, cap. 2. Of Nature, cap. 3. Of Man, cap. 4. Of the Soul. Sect. II. cap. 1. Of Maidenhood, cap. 2. Of Virginity, cap. 3. Of the Virgin-di&s;ea&s;e, cap. 4. Of Love, cap. 5. Of Copulation, &amp;c. Now! pray what relation, what connection, is there be|tween the&s;e out-of-the-way &s;ubjects and Midwifery? Might he not as properly have introduced what he had to &s;ay about Midwifery, with an account of Rat-catching, Rabbit-breeding, or Sow-gelding?</P>
<PB N="54" REF="59">
<P>PRAY does it &s;hew mo&s;t Ingenuity or Stu|pidity, to jumble &s;everal &s;ubjects together, which have no manner of relation, connection, or analogy with one another, or with his main de&s;ign, by way of introduction? <HI>Secondly,</HI> of his Laboriou&s;ne&s;s: I cannot but own that every page is laboured, but in &s;uch a manner, that he often forgets, in le&s;s than a leaf, what he intended to account for or prove, and leaves you as much in the dark as he found you: and that he has &s;pent a great deal of labour upon collecting from Romances, Popi&s;h legends, &amp;c. a parcel of idle, groundle&s;s, nay ridiculous tales, and tells them with all imaginable gravity, and &s;eeming earne&s;tne&s;s; and very &s;eriou&s;ly undertakes to account for unaccountables.

And then he tells us, he's not a little plea&s;ed to find Dr. Maubray agree with him exactly in this point, and advi&s;e this manner of proceeding, in almo&s;t the &s;ame words u&s;ed by him on this occa&s;ion, tho' the words u&s;ed by Dr. M. are very different from his, nay, they are perfect non&s;en&s;e. E. G. He &s;ays, I would fetch the &s;econd child by the feet, in ca&s;e the &s;econd Flooding is not yet over, &amp;c. Pray what does he mean by the &s;econd flooding? Mr. Chapman an|&s;wereth and &s;aith, that by the &s;econd flooding he mu&s;t mean the flowing of the waters; but who, be&s;ides he, ever called the flowing of the waters a flooding? Every body el&s;e means a dangerous flux of blood by a flooding. But if he had looked back as far as Madam du Tertre, &amp;c. he would have
<PB N="57" REF="62">found that very method &s;trongly recommended, and much better, &s;horter, and clearer expre&s;s'd, than either he or Dr. Maubray have done it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Pag. 96.

<P>HE makes again, pag. 65. as great a rout about extracting the Placenta, for three pages together, as if no body had known any thing of the matter before he taught them. E. G. <Q>The Placenta is never to be left to be &s;hut up in the womb, whether the labour has been natural or not; and I have the &s;atisfaction of finding Dr. Maubray recommending this practice.</Q> A great &s;atis|faction indeed! But pray can he find any body who does not recommend it, as well as he and Dr. Maubray?</P>
<P>HE cen&s;ures Dionis pag. 68. for &s;aying, <Q>That the Placenta in an Abortion of two or three months, may be left to come away of it&s;elf.</Q> Which undoubtedly may very often be done without any danger, tho' it's certainly &s;afer to bring it away at fir&s;t, if &s;ent for in time; but if
<PB N="58" REF="63">the child has been come away &s;ome time, I &s;hould give my&s;elf no trouble about it till a flooding appeared. Becau&s;e the irritation cau&s;ed by the fingers, when the Os Tincae is almo&s;t clo&s;ed, may be more apt to cau&s;e an inflamation, flooding, &amp;c. than letting it alone; nay, I knew it once left whole (by the ob&s;tinancy of the mo|ther, who could by no means be per&s;uaded to have it taken away,) between the fourth and fifth month, and yet &s;he did very well. Nay that experienced Midman Mr. Giffard, is al&s;o of the &s;ame opinion, <Q>Of two evils the greater ought to be &s;hunned, there being le&s;s danger in leaving part of the After-birth, which will very often, without doing any great harm, come away with the Lochia, than in u&s;ing any force in extracting it, by which we very often hurt the womb.</Q> Pray can he imagine Mr. Dio|nis did not do the needful, in ca&s;e a flooding did &s;ucceed?</P>
<P>BUT he finds no fault with him, where I think he richly de&s;erves it, when he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paris edit. lib. ii. cap. 15.</NOTE> the Os Tincae in a violent flooding, is more convenient|ly dilated with an in&s;trument, and the fal&s;e concept|tion, &amp;c. extracted with a pair of Forceps, than by the fingers. If this is not finding fault in the wrong place, pray what is? Is it not a mo&s;t dangerous, nay, and unnece&s;&s;ary practice?</P>
<P>PAGE 171. He gives one in&s;tance of a child he delivered with the buttocks foremo&s;t. But pray
<PB N="59" REF="64">how does this quadrate with what he &s;ays, pag. 11. of the &s;ame book; <Q>If the child offers any other part than the head, the hand is to be pa&s;&s;ed in|to the womb, the feet &s;earched for, the child to be turned, and brought forth by them.</Q></P>
<P>PAGE 174. <Q>I was unwilling to have recour&s;e to art.</Q> (Is it not the art of Midwifery, which the Midwomen have been taught, the only thing which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from other women? Are not they obliged to make u&s;e of their art at every labour they are called to? Why then does he &s;o often make u&s;e of the words Art and Arti&s;ts, and only apply them to him&s;elf or &s;ome other Man? Won't any one who reads Madam du Tertre's little book be convinced, that &s;he has &s;hewn more art and better diction, than either Dr. Maubray, or &mdash;. Does her being a woman make it impro|per to &s;ay, &s;he had recour&s;e to art, or that &s;he was an arti&s;t.) <Q>But after two hours trial, finding no advantage from her pains, I was forced to it. I fir&s;t made an attempt with the Fillet; but the young creature's pul&s;e began to &s;ink, and her pains falling off a little, I cho&s;e to take the mo&s;t Speedy, as well as the mo&s;t &s;ecure Method, viz. the Forceps, and delivered her in about two Minutes.</Q></P>
<P>PRAY is not this fairly owning, that the Fillet (he makes a &s;ecret of pag. 17.) is neither &s;o Speedy, nor &s;o Secure a Method as the Forceps? Why then does he keep it a &s;ecret? To what pur|po&s;e can he do it? When he, at the &s;ame time confe&s;&s;es the Forceps, (which he has given us a
<PB N="60" REF="65">print of, tho' a very indifferent one, and nothing new therein,) to be preferable.</P>
<P>THEN he goes on in the &s;ame page 17. and &s;ays, <Q>But I have been told, &s;ince the fir&s;t public|cation of my E&s;&s;ay, that the Fillet is &s;o far from being an invention of mine, that it its ge|nerally, or at lea&s;t very frequently u&s;ed. I own indeed, that it may be commonly u&s;ed in turn|ing a child, by &s;ecuring one foot with it, as I have directed; but do not believe the manner of pa&s;&s;ing it over the head to be &s;o univer&s;ally known and practi&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>DAVENTER, in the appendix to his Ars Ob&s;ter|tricandi, publi&s;hed in 1701. de&s;cribes and very much approves of a Fillet's being pa&s;&s;ed over the child's head in order to extract it. And I my&s;elf have &s;een eight or ten different &s;orts of them, con|trived and u&s;ed by different practitioners. Pray was not Dr. Birch's Fillet put up to be &s;old for 500 <HI>l.</HI> by the late excellent Surgeon Mr. Jo&s;. Sy|mond's? Has not Dr. Sandys had one for many years? Nay I hardly know one who has not, in one &s;hape or other, How then can Mr. Chapman expect to fob us off with &s;aying, that all other people's are for the foot, and his only for the head? Mu&s;t not he think us very weak, and very illiterate if we believed him? Might he not with as much rea&s;on a&s;&s;ert, that he or Dr. Maubray were the fir&s;t inventors of breaking the Membranes of the &s;e|cond child, in order to bring it away pre&s;ently by the feet; or of directing the Placenta to be extracted before the Uterus clo&s;ed upon it, or of tying the Navel-&s;tring within two inches of the child's
<PB N="61" REF="66">belly, &amp;c. all which have been told us by Madam du Tertre.</P>
<P>THEN he winds up the fore&s;aid Girl's ca&s;e, pag. 174. with the&s;e &s;olemn reflections on his own good conduct, and the mi&s;haps which would have befali'n this poor woman had not he been with her. <Q>Had a Midwife been called to this per&s;on &s;ome days, not to &s;ay weeks, before, when her pains and complaints began to vary, and (as is common with young and unexperienced Mid|wives, put her upon her labour too early, which I carefully avoided) con&s;idering the po&s;i|tion of the child, what mu&s;t have been the con|&s;equence?</Q><HI>(Something very frightful undoubted|ly!)</HI> And even had a Man been called, who was <Q>unacquainted with the u&s;e of that noble and &s;afe in&s;trument the Forceps, he mu&s;t have de&s;troyed the child.</Q></P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e a knowing Midwoman, &s;uch a one as Madam du Tertre, &amp;c. had been with her, in the room of his young and unexperienced one, would not &s;he as carefully have avoided putting her upon her labour before her time, as Mr. Chapman did? And &s;uppo&s;ing a Man had been there who had no Forceps about him, but was well acquainted with the u&s;e of Daventer's, Birch's, or any other Fillet, except Mr. Chapman's Secret, (which he owns him&s;elf, pag. 59. would not do,) could not he have extract|ed the child with as much &s;afety as he did with the Forceps?</P>
<P>MR. Chapman, pag. 95. tells us the following &s;tory: <Q>A fine young lady, in labour with her fir&s;t child, was &s;eiz'd with a flooding, and the
<PB N="62" REF="67">arm of the infant pre&s;ented. She imme|diately &s;ent for a Phy&s;ician, who had lately taken upon him to practi&s;e Midwifery, BUT WAS SO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH THE ART, THAT HE NEGLECTED THE ONLY THING NECESSARY IN THAT CASE, viz. a &s;peedy delivery by turning the child; and em|ployed re&s;tringent or &s;typtick medicines. Af|ter &s;ome hours another gentleman was called in, but the lady was now very much weakened, and the arti&s;t, apprehen&s;ive of her expiring under his hands, or immediately after delivery, which in|deed too often happens, would make no at|tempt, but abandoned her to her approaching fate. She lived &s;ome hours after, and then died. Im per&s;uaded it will be allowed by the be&s;t judges, that, had &s;he been immediately deliver|ed, her life might have been &s;aved. I received this account from a worthy matron, who was pre&s;ent during the whole time.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Giffard mentions a ca&s;e of the &s;ame kind, therefore I choo&s;e to place them together. <Q>I was &s;ent for about five in the afternoon, to a woman at Batter&s;ea, who had been deliver|ed of three children about three the preced|ing morning, but the Midwife had left the after|burthens, <HI>(mon&s;terous and fatal ignorance)</HI> hav|ing broke off two of the &s;trings; &s;he not know|ing how to pa&s;s her hand to fetch them, and being called away to another woman, had left her in this condition:</Q><HI>(Could a Turk believe there were any whol&s;ome laws in a country where &s;uch barbari|ties were not &s;everely puni&s;hed?)</HI> Another Mid|wife
<PB N="63" REF="68">
<Q>was &s;ent for, but &s;he would not attempt to bring them away, fearing the woman &s;hould die, and her death be laid to her charge; <HI>(poor unhapy woman!)</HI> &s;o when I came I found the woman in the agonies of death, her whole ma&s;s of blood being drained away by the continual flooding, (viz. <HI>for fifteen hours</HI>) I immediately brought them away, but the woman's blood and &s;pirits were &s;o much exhau&s;ted before, that &s;he expired in le&s;s than an hour afterwards; &s;o that this woman fell a &s;acrifice to the ignorance of one Midwife, and the timidity of the other, for had the burthens been brought away at fir&s;t, before &s;he had lo&s;t &s;o much blood, &s;he had been in no danger of dying. They had &s;ent for one Dr. &mdash;, at &mdash;, who in&s;tead of advi&s;ing them to fetch the burthens away, or coming him&s;elf to do it, had &s;ent forcing Medicines, which would of con&s;equence encrea&s;e the flood|ing, and &s;o ha&s;tened her death. The three chil|dren were all born alive and well.</Q> Who can read this ca&s;e without being &s;hocked at it?</P>
<P>HAS any of the fore-mentioned women com|mitted greater Blunders than the&s;e Doctors? Is it not evident from the&s;e &s;tories, that the Doctor or Apothecary Midmen, are &s;ometimes as ignorant as the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of Midwomen? Pray where could the&s;e Doctors have been admitted to their degrees? Mu&s;t it not have been in &s;ome popi&s;h country, where orthodoxy is reckoned a better recommenda|tion, than the knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es? Where vi&s;it|ing chapels three or four times a day is thought more conducive to the making a good Phy&s;ician,
<PB N="64" REF="69">than frequenting the ho&s;pitals as often? Don't this &s;hew that we want a proper &s;chool for Midmen as well as for Midwomen?</P>
<P>MR. Chapman, pag. 31. tells us of <Q>A woman who had been twice or thrice delivered by a Man, of children that always pre&s;ented with the head, which the operator took a fatal freedom with, viz. u&s;ing a hook,</Q> (Pray how could he tell, who was not pre&s;ent, but that all the&s;e children were dead? That he was obliged to u&s;e a hook, becau&s;e of the large|ne&s;s of the child's head, &s;houlders, or belly? That he was forced to de&s;troy the child to &s;ave the mo|ther? Wherein then con&s;i&s;ts this fatal freedom he talks of? Ought not a Man to be very &s;ure before he accu&s;es another after this manner?) <Q>at la&s;t &s;ent for me.</Q> I think he's much to blame for not telling us, whether this fatal freedom taker was a Doctor or an Apothecary Midman?</P>
<P>THAT excellent Anatomi&s;t Dr. Nicholls, in his Compendium Anatomicum, publi&s;hed in 1733. and republi&s;hed 1736. has the following remarka|ble pa&s;&s;age, <Q><HI>In omni malo &s;itu, ut &amp; in rebus de&s;peratis, pedibus extrahetur Foetus.</HI></Q> i. e. In every wrong po&s;ture, as al&s;o in de&s;perate ca&s;es the child is to be extracted by the feet.</P>
<P>Now, pray is it not a wrong po&s;ture when the buttocks pre&s;ent? And yet the child may be brought away with great &s;afety both to it and the mother when they pre&s;ent, without looking for the feet, vid. pag. 46, 58, &amp;c. The ca&s;e may al&s;o be very de&s;pe|rate, and yet not po&s;&s;ible to bring the child away by the feet. E. G. When the head is too large and &s;ticks in the pa&s;&s;age, when the head is born,
<PB N="65" REF="70">but &s;ticks becau&s;e of the largene&s;s of the &s;houl|ders, or when the belly is full of water, as in the ca&s;e mentioned pag. 14. &amp;c.</P>
<P>DR. C&mdash;writes thus, 1720. <Q><HI>Cum Vagina &s;it nimis angu&s;ta, vel pelvis naturaliter parva, vel Foetus &s;olito major, una nonnuquam continua rima &s;eu &s;ci&s;&s;ura ab vulva ad anum, fit, quod valde pe|riculo&s;um e&s;t &amp; mulierem, &s;i evadat, in po&s;terum &s;terilem reddit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS ca&s;e I have found, by repeated expe|rience, not to be at all dangerous, in per&s;ons other|wi&s;e healthy; and am &s;atisfied that it will contri|bute as little to making them barren as a broken leg.</P>

<HEAD>Deductions from the premi&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THUS you &s;ee what a number of children have been lo&s;t, what a number of women have &s;uffered great and needle&s;s pains, and have been brought into the utmo&s;t danger of their lives, nay have actually fallen Martyrs, Sacrifices, or Victims, as they term it, in the very flower of their age, to the imprudence and ignorance of Midwomen, nay, and Doctor Midmen, vid. pag. 62, 63. and the&s;e only from the accounts of what fell under the cogni&s;ance of two Midmen, viz. Giffard and Chap|man. But pray how high may we &s;uppo&s;e the ac|count might have ri&s;en, if every Midman, &amp;c. who practi&s;ed in England, &s;ince the end of the la&s;t cen|tury, i. e. thirty-five years back, had al&s;o made up their accounts? What a black li&s;t would it be? Is it not &s;hocking to think on't? Are not the&s;e ac|counts
<PB N="66" REF="71">of their blunders enough to frighten the women from ever tru&s;ting to a Midwoman any more? But if the Midwomen in, and about London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, are &s;o generally and &s;o gro&s;ly ig|norant, as tho&s;e gentlemen have repre&s;ented them, what mu&s;t they be in the country? What havock mu&s;t they make among his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects? What numbers of fine women and children mu&s;t daily fall a &s;acrifice by the very hands, <HI>proh dolor!</HI> from whom they expected relief? Is not this a me|lancholy and deplorable ca&s;e? Is it not an evil which demands both a &s;peedy and an effectual re|medy? Can any thing better de&s;erve the attention even of the Legi&s;lature it&s;elf? But granting their ig|norance to be as great as they &s;uppo&s;e, pray will calling of names, &s;uch as Rude, Rough, Negligent, Ignorant, Fooli&s;h, Novice, Ob&s;tinate, Over-confi|dent, Supine, Un&s;kilful, Conceited, Self-&s;uffi|cient, Errand Midwives, &amp;c. or Rebuking, Blam|ing, Checking, and Reprimanding, &amp;c. the&s;e gentle|men have &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon them, make them more prudent or judicious, or enable them in any degree to give better a&s;&s;i&s;tance them&s;elves, and thereby put a &s;top to the great evil they com|plain of &s;o loudly? Surely no!</P>
<P>PRAY have the&s;e Gentlemen Complainants pro|po&s;ed any other method, to prevent for the future, this calamitous, this di&s;mal, this inhuman practice, except to &s;end for one of them, upon every little trifling difficulty? Is not this making mere Nur&s;es of the Midwomen, and &mdash; of their patients? Is it not telling them plainly, that they neither do, nor ever &s;hall know any more of the matter, by
<PB N="67" REF="72">any information they will give them, than (<HI>what they knew before</HI>) ju&s;t to receive a child which drops into their hands? Nay it's much wor&s;e, it's making mere Jack-calls of them; i. e. They mu&s;t hunt about in &s;earch of Their prey, and then &s;end for Them to devour it. But the&s;e gentlemen's &s;cheme, of being con&s;ulted upon every little diffi|culty, is, and always will be, impracticable in many ca&s;es, even in London it &s;elf, and much more in the country, even tho' the Midwomen were as much at their Beck as they them&s;elves could de&s;ire? 1. Becau&s;e &s;ome women are &s;o un&s;ea&s;ona|bly mode&s;t, or ob&s;tinate, that they cannot be pre|vail'd on, on any account, to admit of a Midman, until it's too late. 2. Becau&s;e &s;ome hu&s;bands are as much again&s;t having their wives laid by Men, as they them&s;elves are. 3. Becau&s;e &s;ome people are &s;o very covetous, that they will not &s;uffer a Mid|man to be &s;ent for &s;oon enough to do any good. 4. Becau&s;e &s;ome people are &s;o very poor, that they cannot bear the expence of a Midman. 5. Becau&s;e &s;ome Midmen are &s;o very inhuman, that they won't touch a poor woman, except they are paid fir&s;t, vide pag. 24. 6. Becau&s;e &s;ometimes Midmen can|not be got in time, &amp;c. What would They have the poor Midwomen do in the&s;e ca&s;es? Are They to be blamed for other people's Tempers, Opinions, or Inhumanity? Tho' They have been often to blame, yet they are not always blameable. What then mu&s;t we do? Mu&s;t we always employ Men? Or continue to &s;tand idly by, and &s;uffer our wives and children to be thus cruelly ma&s;&s;acred by igno|rant and unhallowed hands? Mu&s;t we never at|tempt
<PB N="68" REF="73">the cure of this Malignant and mo&s;t Pe&s;ti|lent di&s;temper, by which &s;uch numbers have been, and daily are de&s;troyed, becau&s;e no body has hi|therto endeavoured to do it? No! We mu&s;t apply an effectual remedy, if it can be found, Charity Humanity, and the &s;tronge&s;t ties of nature (viz. the pre&s;ervation of our wives and children) oblige us to do it.</P>
<P>BUT how? What Method will, or can, effectually prevent the di&s;a&s;ters complained of above, for the fu|ture? The ignorance of the Midwomen is, undoubted|ly the principal, if not the &s;ole cau&s;e of the&s;e dire events; and their un&s;kilfulne&s;s is certainly owing to their want of a proper education, and not to their want of capacity, and con&s;equently is more their misfor|tune than their fault. Therefore, the only method by which this fatal di&s;temper can be cured, and all its bad con&s;equences for the future avoided, is to put it in the power of the Midwomen to qualify them&s;elves thoroughly, and at a moderate expence, in all the parts of their mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary office, before ever they are permitted to practi&s;e: (And then they, who did not readily embrace the opportunity, would not only be de&s;ervedly blamed, but ought to be puni&s;hed by the civil Magi&s;trate:) E. G. They ought to be well in&s;tructed, 1. In the knowledge of the nature and &s;ituation, not only of the parts of generation in women, but al&s;o of the circumjacent parts which may be affected by, or may ob&s;truct delivery; and with the nature and u&s;e of the Mem|branes, Waters, Navel-&s;tring, Placenta, &amp;c. of the Foetus. 2. In the cau&s;e and cure of the&s;e di&s;orders and accidents, peculiar to women during their
<PB N="69" REF="74">pregnancy, and after their delivery. 3. In the art of Touching, (to the want of which, mo&s;t of the blunders complained of above, were owing, viz. leaving the Placenta behind, Dragging the womb in|&s;ide out, Mi&s;taking the arm for the foot, the Hips for the Head, Thru&s;ting their fingers through the Vagina, &amp;c.) whereby they can not only tell the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the woman at any time of her ge&s;ta|tion, but al&s;o even prevent many of the difficult and dangerous labours (being always &s;ent for &s;o early) which now happen; E. G. The membranes be|ing broke, and often before, they may certainly tell by the touch, what parts pre&s;ent, then &s;uppo|&s;ing it is the navel-&s;tring, hips, hand, or any other part but the head, advancing in a right po&s;ture, they may at fir&s;t appearance (the parts being then &s;o moi&s;tened by the waters) be ea&s;ily put back, the feet &s;ought for, and the child extracted by them: Whereas, when they have not art and jugement enough to take this favourable opportunity, nature her &s;elf offers; the woman is &s;pent with fruitle&s;s pains, the child advances in a wrong po&s;ture, or too &s;lowly, if in a right one, her body grows dry, the womb collap&s;es, and contracts &s;o clo&s;ely about it, and the child is &s;o jammed, and locked between the bones of the Pelvis, that it cannot be extracted without the greate&s;t difficulty and danger, by the mo&s;t dexterous hands. And how many fall under, or &s;oon after &s;uch operations, the fore-mentioned ca&s;es abundantly &s;hew. Pray is it not much ea&s;ier and &s;afer to prevent &s;uch blunders, than to under|take thecure of them afterwards? 4. In the mo&s;t rational Methods of delivering women, at
<PB N="70" REF="75">any time of their ge&s;tation, of a child, fal&s;e con|ception, or mole, with jugement, dexterity, and expedition. 5. In the knowledge of tho&s;e ca&s;es where in&s;truments are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that they may &s;end directly for a Surgeon, in&s;tead of fatigueing the mother, and endangering both, by needle&s;s delays and fruitle&s;s attempts. 6. In the method of u&s;ing them them&s;elves, where no Sur|geon can be had. <HI>Pre&s;tat anceps quam nullum ad|bibere remedium.</HI></P>
<P>To which method of qualifying them&s;elves, I doubt not the Midwomen will object and &s;ay, that they would readily be at any rea&s;onable expence and fatigue, to be &s;o thoroughly in&s;tructed in all the parts of their office, as I propo&s;e: but it's not in their power, they have no opportu|nity of following this &s;cheme. How can they do it? The Midwomen cannot, and the Midmen won't in&s;truct them. What then would you have them do? Can you blame the&s;e good women then, for doing as well as they can, nay as well as their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es who taught them the little they do know, tho' not &s;o well as they would, had they had the opportunities of being in&s;tructed, as above-mention|ed? To which I an&s;wer, I own their Plea to be ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, until the&s;e opportunities are put in their power.</P>
<P>THE Midmen, I doubt not, will object and &s;ay, that the Midwomen want both Capacity and Strength (in&s;truct them as ye plea&s;e) to perform what I propo&s;e. To which I reply, That this is only an artful and groundle&s;s in&s;inuation, and do affirm, (<HI>ore rotundo, plenis buccis</HI>) that it's not want
<PB N="71" REF="76">of Capacity, Docility, Strength, or Activity, but merely want of fit and full in&s;tructions in all the parts of their office, which di&s;ables them to per|form it, in all ca&s;es (excepting where in&s;truments are nece&s;&s;ary) with as much Ea&s;e, Safety, and Expe|dition, as the mo&s;t dexterous Midman; which is evident to a demon&s;tration, from the &s;ucce&s;sful practice of the Midwomen in the Hotel Dieu at Paris, (the be&s;t &s;chool for Midwomen now in Europe) where they hardly ever want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Surgeon, excepting where in&s;truments mu&s;t be u&s;ed: Which is frankly owned by Mon&s;ieur de la Motte, who &s;ays, that during the &s;pace of &s;ix months, wherein he attended among&s;t the women in the Hotel Dieu at Paris, there was but one hard labour happened where there was the lea&s;t oc|ca&s;ion for a Surgeon, and even that was at la&s;t fi|ni&s;hed by nature; and in that time there were a|bove four hundred delivered, almo&s;t all by the Apprentices, and very rarely by Madam du Ter|tre, who was then fir&s;t Midwife. I have al&s;o been informed lately, by a corre&s;pondent at Paris, that there are now about two thou&s;and women delivered in that ho&s;pital, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> without the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of a Surgeon, excepting as above. Would not any per&s;on then be de&s;ervedly laughed at who &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that our women are not as capable of performing their office, had they the &s;ame in|&s;tructions, as the French women?</P>
<P>BUT this charge of the Midmen will appear &s;till more groundle&s;s, if we con&s;ider the nature of the blunders they are charged with by Dr. Cham|berlen, Giffard, and Chapman, in the ca&s;es before
<PB N="72" REF="77">mentioned, viz. of Pulling at the child's arm, In|verting the Matrix, Mi&s;taking the hand for the foot, Leaving the Placenta behind, Being ignorant of the art of Touching, &amp;c. &amp;c. Pray do the&s;e charges prove their want of Capacity, Docility, or Strength? Surely no! All that can be rea&s;onably de|duced from them, is, that they want a proper edu|cation, which is their misfortune more than their fault, and what I'm endeavouring to put in their power to have. Pray is there a Midwoman in England &s;o &s;tupid, as not to be ea&s;ily convinced, that pulling at the arm is wrong and to no purpo&s;e; that tugging too hard at the Navel-&s;tring, or laying hold of the fund of the womb, in&s;tead of the Pla|centa, will invert the Uterus; or, that mi&s;&s;ing their time to take away the Placenta, when the pa&s;&s;age is open, makes it both difficult, painful, nay, and dangerous to extract it afterwards; or that could not with proper pains be in&s;tructed, to act rationally in the&s;e or mo&s;t other ca&s;es? Pray is there any branch of Surgery in which &s;o many of the family of &mdash; have been and are engaged, as in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Midwifery? (Yet &s;ome of them are very learned and knowing Men.) An affair of &s;uch va&s;t importance to mankind.</P>
<P>How can it be made appear, that Doctors, Apothecaries, and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of Surgeons, who are as little acquainted with the other princi|pal operations of Surgery, as the very women them|&s;elves, are more capable of performing the&s;e ope|rations than They, who have much more practice, and many of them as good capacities? Pray where|in con&s;i&s;ts the &s;ecret? It requires no Mathematicks,
<PB N="73" REF="78">no &s;kill in Philo&s;ophy, no Univer&s;ity learning at all, otherwi&s;e mo&s;t of the Midmen would be di|&s;tanced as well as all the Midwomen. Has not all ages produced women who have made a figure in the mo&s;t &s;ublime parts of learning, and in all man|ner of curious and u&s;eful arts; and al&s;o illiterate thick-headed Prie&s;ts, Lawyers, and Phy&s;icians? All which is occa&s;ioned by nothing &s;o much as having, or wanting, a proper education. <HI>Why then, is it not rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that they might al&s;o be made capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting their own &s;ex, at that time when it is lea&s;t proper for Men to come near them?</HI></P>
<P>BUT now to come to the main point, viz. How the method I propo&s;e for the regular in&s;truction of the Midwomen, can be put in execution? To which I an&s;wer: 1. That an ho&s;pital be erected, E. G. in London or We&s;tmin&s;ter (at the publick expence, by donation, or &s;ub&s;criptions, as &s;everal Alms-hou&s;es, Infirmaries, Ho&s;pitals, &amp;c. of far le&s;s con&s;equence to the Commonweal, have been and are daily carried on) for the reception of about two or three hundred poor women who are big with child. 2. That a proper number of Midwomen be appointed to attend them. 3. That two Surgeon Midmen be appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the&s;e Midwomen in all extraordinary ca&s;es, and to de|mon&s;trate the &s;tructure of the parts concerned, ex|plain the art of touching, &amp;c. as above, in &s;et lectures, at lea&s;t three times a week, to all the Midwomen and their apprentices who plea&s;e to attend. 4. That every young woman, who de&s;igns to practice Midwifery,
<PB N="74" REF="79">&s;hall be obliged to attend the&s;e cour&s;es during her apprentice&s;hip; then go and practi&s;e, for a &s;et time, under tho&s;e expert Midwomen in that Ho|&s;pital: Afterwards let them be examined as to the &s;kill and knowledge they have acquired in their profe&s;&s;ion, by the two Surgeons, (&s;ince our <HI>Dom, fac. totum</HI> take Midwifery either to be no part of Surgery, or &s;uch a trifling part of it, that it's be|low their notice; notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of them can di&s;tingui&s;h, to a mathematical exactne&s;s, how many grains of more knowledge in Surgery is re|qui&s;ite for a Surgeon of a fir&s;t, than of a &s;econd rate Man of War,) and &s;ix or &s;even other per&s;ons, appointed by his maje&s;ty, (becau&s;e I don't think it rea&s;onable, that &s;o many people's bread &s;hould de|pend on the humour and caprice of any two Men only,) and if approved, to receive from them a certificate of their fitne&s;s to practi&s;e in London or any where el&s;e. 5. That, until fit Ho&s;pitals can be built and endowed, a Midman be appointed in every city, or county-town in England, to read the fore&s;aid lectures to all the Midwomen in the county, and demon&s;trate to them the truth of their doctrines on the poor of the neighbourhood, of which there are plenty every where.</P>
<P><HI>If this, or &s;ame &s;uch</HI> SCHEME, <HI>was put in execution, in the principal town; of the kingdom, I'm &s;atisfied, in a very few years there would hardly be an ignorant Midwoman in England, and con&s;equently the great agonies, mo&s;t wo|men &s;uffer at the very mention of a Man, would be almo&s;t entirely prevented; the great expence they co&s;t &s;aved;
<PB N="75" REF="80">and the melancholy &s;cenes above-mentioned, would be no more &s;een nor heard of. What can be more De&s;irable? What can &s;hew more Humanity? What can be more Charitable, than to pur&s;ue a De&s;ign, whereby the lives of &s;o many innocent children, and valuable women, may be yearly, nay daily, &s;aved from de&s;truction?</HI></P>
