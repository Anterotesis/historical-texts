<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Ob&s;ervations and Complaints of the ill State and Male-Practice of Phy&s;ick in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> were at fir&s;t intended to appear in another Dre&s;s; and by way of Appeal to our neighbour|ing Nations, where that noble and nece&s;|&s;ary Art is &s;aid to be exerci&s;ed in a more regular and beneficial manner. For By|&s;tanders, who are not heated by Animo|&s;ities and per&s;onal Reflections, who are not intere&s;ted in a Debate, and have no Party-Quarrel to maintain, are the fit|te&s;t Per&s;ons to examine and determine the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Cau&s;e; and as their Pa&s;&s;ions are calmer and more mode|rate, &s;o their Deci&s;ions are likely to be more ju&s;t and equal, and agreeable to Truth, than the Sentiments of tho&s;e Peo|ple, who are more nearly concerned. But when I con&s;idered, that all national
<PB N="iv" REF="5">Grievances, (and certainly the Abu&s;e of this excellent Faculty is a very great <HI>one!</HI>) ought rather to be corrected at home, than expo&s;ed abroad; that the Mi&s;management and Di&s;hone&s;ty of <HI>ma|ny</HI> &s;hou'd not procure the Condemnation of <HI>all;</HI> and Offenders only &s;hou'd &s;uffer; and that they too could not be <HI>legally</HI> re|&s;trained and puni&s;hed, but by the Legi|&s;lative Powers; I had Thoughts of ad|dre&s;&s;ing them to a Worthy Patriot, who might, in Parliament, have procured a Redre&s;s of as many of them at lea&s;t, as the Wi&s;dom of the Nation might think worth their Cognizance. Yet con&s;ider|ing how far that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly is em|barra&s;s'd and engaged in the more ardu|ous and difficult Affairs of the Nation, and likewi&s;e the Temper and Ta&s;te of my intended Patron; the one &s;o exqui&s;ite and di&s;tingui&s;hing, that &s;carce a Word could drop from the Pen without the Terror of Reprehen&s;ion; and the other &s;o moderated, that had I attempted to make way for a favourable Reception by (the common Method in Dedications) re|citing but few of his real Accompli&s;h|ments, it wou'd &s;carce have been looked upon as a ju&s;t Encomium. I re&s;olved at length therefore to adventure into a cen&s;orious World the&s;e rude Papers, containing little el&s;e but Matters of Fact as naked Truths, without any &V;mbrage
<PB N="v" REF="6">or Defence; and think, the&s;e Difficul|ties pre&s;enting, the giving my Rea&s;ons for making no Dedication, is Dedication enough. For in all Di&s;qui&s;itions about Truth, 'tis not the Greatne&s;s, the Au|thority, and Weight of the Advocate, but of his Arguments and Proofs, that is the Point to be minded; and the more plain and unadorned his Di&s;cour&s;e is, the greater Air of Veracity it hath. For which rea&s;on I &s;hall no more be at the pains to make any Apology for the loo&s;e Compo&s;ition and carele&s;s Diction of this Pamphlet, than I &s;hall think my &s;elf obliged to an&s;wer the unrea&s;onable Cavils, and loud Clamours that may be rai&s;ed by &s;elf-intere&s;ted and di&s;hone&s;t Men again&s;t it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons of this Work. 1&s;t.</NOTE> Thinking that I &s;hall have &s;ufficiently di&s;charged my <HI>Con&s;ci|ence,</HI> in detecting their Di&s;hone&s;ty; and that it is not in their Power to &s;ay much in their own Vindication, without ex|po&s;ing more of their own Di&s;ingenuity and Ba&s;ene&s;s, to the Judicious e&s;pecially, and di&s;cerning Part of Mankind. Nei|ther &s;hall I think it any Reflection, that others have offered the &s;ame Things in a better manner; but rather as a Confir|mation of what I &s;ay; that makes what I here deliver, appear with the greater Force of Evidence.</P>
<P>Though it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Matters go not &s;o well with the World,
<PB N="vj" REF="7">as that mo&s;t Voices &s;hou'd be on the be&s;t Side; and &s;uch Per&s;ons as are Slaves to their Lu&s;ts, indolent, ignorant and cre|dulous, take up with the Opinions and Ways in fa&s;hion without much Exami|nation; and thus are ea&s;ily led on to their own Di&s;advantage, and &s;ometimes De|&s;truction, by Men of corrupt Minds, who&s;e &s;ole Advantage lies in Cheat and Impo&s;ition, and who, of con&s;equence, have al&s;o a burning Hatred to plain, open, and fair Dealing, and to the Truth: and from whom her &s;tricte&s;t Fol|lowers mu&s;t expect to meet with the &s;e|vere&s;t &V;&s;age. The Truths even of the Holy Go&s;pel have generally been on the &s;uffering Side. And when I &s;ee tho&s;e, promulged for the Salvation of Souls, have met with &s;uch bad Treatment, how can I expect that the&s;e, of le&s;s Impor|tance, calculated only for the Safety of the Body, &s;hou'd find a more gracious Reception?</P>
<P>But if I am guilty of any Breach of good Manners, in meddling with other Mens Morals, Means of living, and In|tere&s;ts, I am &s;orry for it. And if in my Enquiries I have been any way im|po&s;ed upon, and led into Mi&s;takes; or have been too impertinent and tedious, too clamorous and &s;evere, I humbly beg pardon, and &s;ubmit to the Correction of my legal Superiors, a&s;&s;uring them,
<PB N="vij" REF="8">that I &s;peak no Fal&s;hoods, to the be&s;t of my &V;nder&s;tanding and Knowledge; and as I had no Plea&s;ure in finding out, &s;o I have no Profit in publi&s;hing the fol|lowing Di&s;orders; which indeed have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d.</NOTE> of long time, been no Secrets to Multi|tudes of &s;uffering People, who have hi|therto complained in vain, and groan under un&s;ufferable Oppre&s;&s;ions that they wou'd gladly get rid of, if they knew where or how they could be relieved, and which have been di&s;covered by many worthy Phy&s;icians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d.</NOTE> But then they have touched the&s;e Sores too tenderly; either fearing too much the Re&s;entment of tho&s;e People, who would not have them healed; or, finding it a Difficulty to &s;et Men <HI>right,</HI> who go <HI>wrong</HI> out of Choice and Intere&s;t, &s;urmounting all their Endeavours; and that I have no Ends in giving my&s;elf and others this Trouble, but what are ju&s;t and ho|ne&s;t, and de&s;igned &s;incerely for the com|mon Good and Welfare of Mankind.</P>
<P>And as true Hone&s;ty, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th.</NOTE> Inte|grity of Heart and Life, is the fir&s;t, the chief, and fundamental Point of true Wi&s;dom; &s;o it is likewi&s;e, when apply'd to our Occupations and Profe&s;&s;ions, Trade and Commerce; the only &s;ure Ba&s;is there|of, the mo&s;t preferable thing, and to be regarded above Gain. On the contrary; As all unaccountable Ways of Live|lihood,
<PB N="viij" REF="9">all Extortion and unrea&s;onable Profit, are certainly di&s;hone&s;t; &s;o more e&s;pecially when the Life and Health, as well as the E&s;tate of our Neighbour is endanger'd thereby, they become ob|noxious, and ought to be condemned and rejected as intolerable. And, as &s;aith a grave and learned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et &s;i ad hone&s;tatem nati &s;umus, ea aut &s;ola expe|tenda e&s;t, aut certe omni pondere gravior e&s;t haben|da. <HI>Tull.</HI></NOTE> Author, <Q>"There are ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, why Men that are notorious for any Vice or Crime &s;hou'd be expo&s;ed and repre&s;ented as they de|&s;erve, not only to prevent others from falling into their Hands, and &s;uffer|ing by their Wickedne&s;s; but that they may undergo that Shame and Re|proach, which ever mu&s;t be the Por|tion of ill Men".</Q></P>
<P>To pretend to put a &s;top to male Pra|ctice in Phy&s;ick, is a bold &V;ndertaking: and notwith&s;tanding it may, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, appear very nece&s;&s;ary and com|mendable to &s;ome; yet as it may be thought by a prevailing Majority, to proceed rather from Spite or Di&s;gu&s;t than Di&s;cretion, it may chance to ruin him that will he &s;o hardy as to attempt it.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I am induced to lay open the Faults and Frauds of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th.</NOTE> for the &s;ake of
<PB N="ix" REF="10">Ju&s;tice and Charity it&s;elf; let the E|vent be what it will, I re&s;olve to per|&s;evere in this hone&s;t Di&s;qui&s;ition, tho' I gain nothing thereby, but that Peace of Mind, that proceeds nece&s;&s;arily from the Reflection that I have done my Du|ty.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t innocent, as well as the mo&s;t &s;erviceable and be&s;t Parts of a Man's Life, are frequently mi&s;under&s;tood, and highly cen&s;ured. Yet, becau&s;e I know my Intentions are founded upon a good Bottom, I may &s;till hope that they will di&s;cover them&s;elves, and be ju&s;tified by all in the Conclu&s;ion: Being &s;atisfied that what I &s;hall deliver hath Truth on its Side, (&s;o far as I am able to come at the Knowledge thereof) which is the be&s;t Patron; and under that Protection I leave it.</P>

There are &s;ome inqui&s;itive People, who will needs know how I came by the&s;e di&s;mal, ill-natured Accounts of the Male-Admini&s;tration of Phy|&s;ick?

For being a Piece of a Phy|&s;ician my&s;elf, who have had a liberal Educa|tion in one of our own celebrated Univer&s;i|ties, and performed (tho' perfunctorily I mu&s;t confe&s;s with Compunction) all the Exerci&s;es there required to be done for the la&s;t Degree that a Student can be honoured with in that Academy; who have &s;pent &s;ome Years in the Whole&s;ale Apothecaries Shops in <HI>London,</HI> where I had an Opportunity of examining in|to their adulterate and deadly Compo&s;itions, of &s;eeing too many of their unfaithful Di&s;|pen&s;ations; and have been a Practitioner of above twenty Years &s;tanding, (for &s;ome time in the Country, but for the major Part) in this grand Metropolis, and con&s;equently could not well avoid being not only Ear, but more frequently an Eye-witne&s;s of tho&s;e <HI>horrid Practices,</HI> (as <HI>one</HI> ingenuous and faithful Apo|thecary, who could hardly ever be prevail'd upon to leave his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Shop, to intrude into the &s;ick Chambers, was u&s;ed to call them) that introduce &s;uch va&s;t Swarms of impudent Empiricks into Credit with the unthinking Multitude, and unwary People, and di&s;courage and di&s;grace the true Phy&s;ici|ans, as well as deprive them of their ju&s;t Rights, and lawful Emoluments.</P>

Doth not every Day's Experience convince us, that the &s;ame Re|medy applied to the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e may be &s;uc|ce&s;sful in &s;ome Con&s;titutions, and fatal in others<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Illud ignorari non opertet, qu&ograve;d non minibus aegris eadem auxilia conveniunt: non omnibus, etiam in &s;imilibus ca&s;ibus optulantur. <HI>Cel&s;.</HI></NOTE>?

<P>Such <HI>Practicers</HI> then, it is to be &s;u&s;pected, are more frequently obliged to bring the Sym|ptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es to their Receipts, than ac|commodate their Receipts to the Di&s;ea&s;es.

'Tis better to wait, to ob&s;erve, and give nothing, where there is Cau&s;e to doubt, than venture to give what may prove wrong. And it were to be wi&s;hed, there was not, by the great Numbers of Me|dicines flung in at random, perhaps to plea&s;e, or to amu&s;e, (not to mention &s;ome le&s;s ho|nourable Ends) more De&s;truction made, than by Di&s;tempers them&s;elves.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">All Apothe|caries, the pra|cti&s;ing and re|tale Apotheca|ries e&s;pecially, take in&s;uffera|ble prices for the vile&s;t Medi|cines.</NOTE>AND this is the principal Cau&s;e of the ma|nife&s;t Di&s;agreement between the hone&s;t Phy&s;icians and the unju&s;t Apothecaries; and al&s;o between Phy&s;icians them&s;elves. Of which I &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter; having not yet di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the the ungrateful Subject the unmerciful Apotheca|ries have led me into. Not a Family is without the practi&s;iing and retale Apothecaries Bills by them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See &sect;. 4, 10, 14, 15.</NOTE> And their Exactions may be ea&s;ily di&s;|covered, by comparing the whole&s;ale Apothe|caries and Druggi&s;ts Bills or Charges to them with theirs. And the whole&s;ale Man charges liquid <HI>Laudanum</HI> at 9 <HI>d.</HI><HI>per</HI> Ounce to the Reta|ler; who &s;ells it out again (made up into Draughts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) at 1 <HI>s.</HI> for 20 Drops. I have known it calculated, That they &s;ell <HI>London Laudanum</HI> (made up into a Bolus with a little Con&s;erve) at an 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Profit: they buy it at 5 <HI>s.</HI><HI>per</HI> Ounce, nay, (to come as near as may be to the Point) they buy it at half
<PB N="33" REF="43">a Farthing a Grain, and &s;ell it out at 96 &mdash; half Farthings a Grain.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in his Art of Di&s;tilling tells us, They will make 20 Gallons of Plague Water, at 2 <HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> prime Co&s;t: and they &s;ell it out again whole&s;ale at 8 <HI>l.</HI> that is, at 8 <HI>s.</HI><HI>per</HI> Gallon, nay at 12 <HI>s.</HI><HI>per</HI> Gallon, and retale at 2 <HI>d.</HI> an ounce, or 21 <HI>s.</HI> and 4 <HI>d.</HI><HI>per</HI> Gallon. And this is the hone&s;te&s;t, and mo&s;t rea&s;onable of their Gains in things of this nature. In many Articles (to de&s;cend to particulars were endle&s;s) their Profit runs incredibly higher. And their Pretence for keeping up the Price of Medicines to this exorbitant pitch, is, Becau&s;e &s;ome are peri&s;hable.</P>
<P>But the College Di&s;pen&s;atory of 1721. ut|terly deprives them of this Plea, ordering <HI>all</HI> Medicines to be &s;o wi&s;ely prepared, That <HI>few,</HI> if any, are peri&s;hable in any rea&s;onable time: And of tho&s;e that are any way liable to decay, they keep but &s;mall Quantities by them, or make them extempore, as they have pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their whole Trade, as now managed, an intolerable Grievance, <HI>&amp;c,</HI></NOTE>Thus their Art is degenerated into a mo&s;t abominable Grievance, that ever was &s;uffered to be openly and continually carried on, in any the mo&s;t abject and corrupted Na|tion under Heaven. The Grocers, (out of who&s;e Company the <HI>London</HI> Apothecaries were at fir&s;t drawn, and then incorporated) even tho&s;e of them that are Retalers, and many o|ther hone&s;t Trade&s;men declare them&s;elves &s;atis|fied, if they can get one Penny in a Shilling: and are too frequently obliged to take up and to be content with much le&s;s Profit in Commo|dities of far greater Value, and more expo&s;ed to damage than any the Apothecaries deal in. And why they &s;hould be indulged in &s;uch in|&s;ufferable
<PB N="34" REF="44">and oppre&s;&s;ive Demands, and mon|&s;trous Profit in things (which if they were good) of very little worth, for tho&s;e Things that co&s;t them little or nothing, is a Thing utterly beyond my Capacity to account for.</P>
<P>All the Efforts of &s;ome hone&s;t and compa&s;&s;i|onate Phy&s;icians to &s;top the Current of the&s;e Abu&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apothecaries incorrigible.</NOTE> have, for ought I can find, tended to no other End, than to exa&s;perate the cove|tous and unju&s;t <HI>Mortar-drubbers</HI> again&s;t them. Tho' they have imitated the Company of Phy|&s;icians at <HI>Athens,</HI> called <GAP DESC="foreign">, becau&s;e they wou'd take no Money of their Patients, they have received no other reward for their charita|ble Intentions and Practices, than to be di&s;pa|raged and ill-&s;poken of, and to be obviated in their Preten&s;ions, and to be thru&s;t out of every Family, that wou'd give any credit to the ma|licious and &s;elf intere&s;ted In&s;inuations of the&s;e cunning Men.</P>
<P>This male Treatment (no doubt on't at fir&s;t) animated the Doctors to erect their Di&s;|pen&s;atories: That the <HI>Sick-Poor</HI> having their Advice <HI>gratis,</HI> might be al&s;o &s;upplied with Re|medies at a very low rate; and that the Rich too might be &s;ecure of pure and effectu|al Medicines at a moderate Price; and the Lives of their Patients, and their own Re|putation in &s;ome mea&s;ure in&s;ured to boot.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;pen&s;ato|ries, and Infir|maries recom|mended.</NOTE>AND here, I hope, it may not be thought an unpardonable Digre&s;&s;ion to in&s;inu|ate the national Advantage of Infirmaries, and Works of this nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. &sect;. 17.</NOTE> Which were they en|couraged, and carry'd on, according to the fir&s;t Intention of them, would prove no doubt noble Benefits to Per&s;ons of all Conditions. The College Di&s;pen&s;atory, I &s;ay, is an Under|taking worthy of imitation by tho&s;e Phy&s;ici|ans that re&s;ide in poor and populous Coun|tries, and are any way able to beat the Charge, and willing to be at the Trouble of erecting a Di&s;pen&s;atory, or keeping a Clo&s;et of choice Medicines in their own Hou&s;es. And it wou'd be a great Encouragement to the Faculty, if in or near every Market Town, there were a Phy&s;ician appointed, at a certain Salary (to be rai&s;ed by a Pari&s;h Rate or Levy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) to attend the Poor that &s;hall be &s;ick: who &s;hou'd be brought and placed in Infirmaries provided in every Pari&s;h, (or 2 or 3 Pari&s;hes might join their Stocks) for that End and Purpo&s;e. This wou'd be no more (I dare adventure to affirm, much le&s;s) Charge to the &s;everal Pari&s;hes, than they are now at, in paying ignorant Pre|tenders to Phy&s;ick for their attendance upon them, and their bad Medicines: and in Main|tenance of the Widows and Children of tho&s;e unfortunate poor Men, that have fallen into bad Hands, and who&s;e Lives might have been pre&s;erved, had an hone&s;t and skilful Phy&s;ician been apply'd to. Moreover, as one remarks, The &s;ooner Di&s;ea&s;es are taken notice of (tho&s;e that are Epidemical e&s;pecially: and the&s;e begin
<PB N="36" REF="46">generally and make their fir&s;t advances among&s;t the poore&s;t &s;ort of People,) by accurate and expert Phy&s;icians, the le&s;s Footing they will have, the Cure of them will be the ea&s;ier, and their Advice will be rendered the more effectu|al. Which being u&s;urped by the&s;e injudicious Pretenders, the Di&s;tempers being mi&s;taken, or mal-treated, become Malignant, Contagious and Fatal. And the &s;ooner a poor Man is re&s;tored to his Health, he will be the &s;ooner able to provide for his Family; and it will be a more e&s;pecial advantage to the Pari&s;h, if it &s;hall prevent his Death: by which el&s;e a nume|rous Family may be left helple&s;s upon their hands. And it will be a great Advantage to the Neighbourhood when any of them want a Phy&s;ician, by his being &s;o near to them, and he may afford to attend them for much &s;maller than the pre&s;ent accu&s;tomed and extravagant Fees. And the more Vi&s;its he makes to the Sick-Poor, the greater will be his Experience, the more certain his Ob&s;ervations, and the more capable will he be to Advi&s;e the Nobility and Gentry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But to return to the Matter in hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apothecaries formerly Ser|vants to Phy|&s;icians: but now a&s;pire to be above their Ma&s;ters.</NOTE>Since this flagrant Perfidy of the Apotheca|ries hath been detected, and they have been frequently reproved, what Reformation hath appeared among&s;t them?

<P>I need not here again recite, that the right and judicious Under&s;tanding of the Animal Oeconomy, a long and regular Cour&s;e of Stu|dy and Application, together with abundance of judicious In&s;tructions, and Expence of Money as well as Time; and after all, Expe|rience too to apply all the acquired Faculties and Science of Phy&s;ick aright, is nece&s;&s;ary to the Accompli&s;hment of a Phy&s;ician.

(Indeed it is difficult to di&s;cover Me|dicines when mixed throughly, but by their mi&s;&s;ing in their u&s;ual Effects.) Nor dare they correct their extravagant Bills given in to
<PB N="56" REF="66">their Patients; for then they mu&s;t lo&s;e their Credit with them, and &s;hall be <HI>outed</HI> as fa&s;t as they were introduced into any Family.

And it is to be hoped, that the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will e're long do our Univer&s;ities ju&s;tice; &s;ince there is no Nation be&s;ides, (as a worthy Gentleman hath remarked,) where the Profe&s;&s;ors of its Univer&s;ities have not the Liberty of exerci&s;ing their Profe&s;&s;ion in any Part thereof, without &s;uch Interruption and unheard-of Violence offered to their Per|&s;ons
<PB N="71" REF="81">and Characters. And &s;urely Stupidity and Ignorance, and a Di&s;regard to all Litera|ture and religious Education, is not &s;o predo|minant, nor the Concern for the Health and Safety of the People &s;o cold and indifferent, that the Repre&s;entative Body of our own Na|tion will think our Peoples Lives of le&s;s Value than tho&s;e of other Regions, or our own Univer&s;ities the lea&s;t con&s;iderable in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>And when the People are undeceived by this interpo&s;ing Authority, it is to be hoped the&s;e Di&s;orders will be at an end: The&s;e irre|gular Intruders, and unqualified Invaders of this noble, learned and nece&s;&s;ary Science will be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and all due Encouragement af|forded to our regular Phy&s;icians, who ju&s;tly (and that for the Good and Advantage of the Nation in general, as well as for their own ju&s;t Dues and private Emolument and Sub&s;i|&s;tence) claim a Redre&s;s of the&s;e Grievances: Since all Orders of Men expect to have ju|&s;tice done their Characters, Rights and In|tere&s;ts, from the End and De&s;ign of their In&s;titution, and from a general Account of their Conduct; and not from the ill Manage|ment of a few, or the Introduction of &s;ome irregular Cu&s;toms, which they could not fore|&s;ee, and cannot yet prevent.</P>
