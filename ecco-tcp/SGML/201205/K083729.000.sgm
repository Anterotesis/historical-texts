<HEAD>A LECTURE ON MUSCULAR MOTION.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Importance of the &s;ubject.</NOTE>THIS Lecture was founded by Dr. Croone, who was one of the original Fellows of this Society, having been previou&s;ly a member of tho&s;e private meetings which laid the foundation of this in&s;titution. He was not only a phy&s;ician of learning and eminence, but his cha|racter for ta&s;te, as well as for mathematical and natural knowledge, was &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, that he was elected Profe&s;&s;or of Rhetoric in Gre&s;ham College<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ward's Lives of the Gre&s;ham Profe&s;&s;ors.</NOTE>, and was appointed a member of the fir&s;t council of the Royal Society. What prompted him to perpetuate and keep alive an attention to this &s;ubject was, no doubt, an opinion of its importance and difficulty. There are certain branches of know|ledge
<PB N="2" REF="3">which, being con&s;idered as belonging to particular profe&s;&s;ions, appear le&s;s intere&s;ting to men who entertain a ta&s;te for general &s;cience; and this has in &s;ome mea&s;ure been the ca&s;e with inquiries relating to the animal oeconomy. But when we con&s;ider the rank which animated beings hold in the &s;cale of Nature, and that Mu&s;|cular Motion involves &s;ome of the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances relating to them, it cannot be denied that this is a &s;ubject highly intere&s;ting, as a branch of natural knowledge in general, indepen|dent of its utility as &s;ub&s;ervient to medicine. For though &s;en&s;itive beings bear no a&s;&s;ignable proportion to the great volume of the ma|terial world, yet as man belongs to this cla&s;s of exi&s;tence, and as all other exi&s;tence would &s;eem to be created in vain, unle&s;s there were beings capable of perception and enjoyment, the inve&s;tigation of animal nature appears to be of the utmo&s;t importance, not only as the grounds of a u&s;eful art, but as an object of philo&s;ophical curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exten&s;ive in|fluence of mu&s;|cular power in the animal oeconomy.</NOTE>Mu&s;cular motion is ju&s;tly deemed an important and a characteri&s;tic attribute of animated beings, not only as conferring that loco-mo|tive faculty peculiar to animals, and that power by which they are enabled to exerci&s;e a command over external objects, but al&s;o as it con&s;titutes that energy by which the motion of the fluids and all the internal functions of the body are carried on. For we are to con&s;ider as mu&s;cles not only tho&s;e large ma&s;&s;es of fle&s;h which com|po&s;e &s;o great a proportion of the whole bulk of the body, but like|wi&s;e all the minuter organs &s;ub&s;ervient to circulation, nutrition, and &s;ecretion; &s;ince not only the heart it&s;elf, but the whole va&s;cu|lar &s;y&s;tem and the inte&s;tines, owe their action to certain powers of irritability and contractility peculiar to mu&s;cular fibres.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<P>In inve&s;tigating this &s;ubject, it &s;eems mo&s;t natural to begin by comparing the mu&s;cles, and the motion belonging to them, to other modifications of matter and motion that occur in nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Properties of a Mu&s;cle in its dead &s;tate.</NOTE>A mu&s;cle, even in &s;o far as its &s;tructure is an object of our &s;en&s;es in its dead &s;tate, has characters which di&s;tingui&s;h it from every other &s;ub&s;tance in nature. The mo&s;t &s;triking of the&s;e, is its re|gular organization of parallel fibres. The fibrous &s;tructure is, in|deed, found in other parts of the body, &s;uch as the tendons and ligaments, and al&s;o in vegetables, &s;ome of which are even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of vi&s;ible irritability; and a &s;imilar conformation is manife&s;t in &s;ome minerals, &s;uch as the <HI>a&s;be&s;tos;</HI> but there is a certain degree of tena|city, ela&s;ticity, and moi&s;ture, which, joined to its fibrous organi|zation, di&s;tingui&s;h it from every other form of matter. With re|gard to the minute &s;tructure of mu&s;cles, though &s;ome have fancied they have &s;een, by the help of gla&s;&s;es, the ultimate fibres, and the&s;e con&s;i&s;ting either of hollow tubes, or &s;trings of ve&s;icles, or rhom|boidal articulations, according to the re&s;pective theory with which the mind of the ob&s;erver was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it appears, from the be&s;t micro&s;copical ob&s;ervations, that the fibres are divi&s;ible beyond what the powers of the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;ight can trace, and that they are to all appearance uniform.</P>
<P>This regular fibrous &s;tructure of mu&s;cles, may be compared to the cry&s;talli&s;ation of &s;alts, and other regular forms which inanimate bodies a&s;&s;ume, when pa&s;&s;ing to a &s;olid form from a &s;tate of &s;olution or fu&s;ion. Every &s;pecies of matter has a mode of aggregation pe|culiar to it&s;elf, when its particles are at liberty to attract each other according to that tendency which has been called their <HI>polarity.</HI> Tho&s;e who fir&s;t conceived this idea, &s;eemed to have proceeded on
<PB N="4" REF="5">the &s;uppo&s;ition of the ultimate particles of matter being &s;olid bo|dies, infinitely hard, having their different &s;ides endowed with different powers of attraction and repul&s;ion, &s;o as to give various configurations to the parts of matter, when concreting into a &s;olid form. There is another and later idea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Blagden's Experiments on the cooling of Water below its freezing point. Phil. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXVIII. page 143.</NOTE> of polarity, founded on the hypothe&s;is of the ultimate particles of matter being combinations of attracting and repelling points, which when brought much within the natural limits of the&s;e powers, produce unequal degrees of at|traction and repul&s;ion at equal di&s;tances from their common centre, thereby defining what may be called the &s;hape of the particles, and con&s;tituting polarity. In whatever manner we conceive this to take place, &s;ome &s;uch circum&s;tance &s;eems univer&s;al, and perhaps nece&s;|&s;ary to all the varieties of &s;olid matter; and there is in &s;ome in|&s;tances a difference in the appearance and other properties of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, after pa&s;&s;ing from a fluid to a &s;olid form, according as its particles have been at liberty to follow more or le&s;s freely the tendency of their polarity in the act of concretion. This may be illu&s;trated by the freezing of water, and the cry&s;talli&s;ation of &s;alts, which are more or le&s;s regular or confu&s;ed, according to the cir|cum&s;tances in which they have taken place. The &s;ame may be exemplified in metals and other &s;ub&s;tances; for it is well known, that the properties of iron and gla&s;s, in point of cohe&s;ion and ela&s;ti|city, are very much affected by the quickne&s;s or &s;lowne&s;s with which they pa&s;s from a &s;tate of fu&s;ion to a &s;tate of &s;olidity. It is probably in &s;ome circum&s;tance of this kind that mu&s;cles differ from other &s;oft animal matter. We cannot trace by in&s;pection the man|ner in which the fluid nutritious matter is <HI>applied</HI> in forming &s;olid parts; but as mu&s;cles are compo&s;ed of parts &s;o regularly figured
<PB N="5" REF="6">and endowed with contractility, it &s;eems probable that there is &s;ome provi&s;ion made by Nature, whereby the particles follow the exact impul&s;e of their polarity, and con&s;titute a more exqui&s;ite &s;tructure than in other parts of the body.</P>
<P>So far with regard to the character of a Mu&s;cle, con&s;idered in its dead &s;tate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;cular Mo|tion con&s;idered in relation to other motions.</NOTE>The fir&s;t circum&s;tance that meets the attention in con&s;idering its living &s;tate, is that contractile power or motion, which is properly the &s;ubject of this Lecture; and in order to inve&s;tigate its nature, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to compare it with that which takes place in inanimate bodies, by con&s;idering the nature of motion in general.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion an ori|ginal and na|tural property of all matter.</NOTE>So far as we know, either from actual ob&s;ervation, or from ana|logy, there does not exi&s;t in nature any &s;uch thing as ab&s;olute <HI>re&s;t:</HI> for when we contemplate the motions of the earth and heavenly bodies, the various complications of the planetary revolutions in their rotation round their own axes, and in the paths of their orbits, in the irregularities ari&s;ing from the di&s;turbances of their mutual gravitation, and from the prece&s;&s;ion of the equinoxes, not to mention the influence of the innumerable &s;iderial &s;y&s;tems upon each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Her&s;chel's paper on the con&s;truction of the Heavens. Phil. Tran&s;. Vol. LXXV. page 231.</NOTE>, it may be affirmed, on inconte&s;tible principles, that no particle of mat|ter ever was, or will be, for two in&s;tants of time, in the &s;ame place, and that no particle of it ever has returned, or will return, to any one point of ab&s;olute &s;pace which it has ever formerly occupied. Whe|ther motion, therefore, can &s;trictly be called an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> property of matter or not, it is, certainly, by the actual con&s;titution of nature, originally and indefea&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed upon it; and as re&s;t does not
<PB N="6" REF="7">exi&s;t in nature, but may be con&s;idered, in a vulgar &s;en&s;e, as a fal|lacy of the &s;en&s;es, and in a philo&s;ophical &s;en&s;e, as an ab&s;traction of the mind, it follows, that what is called the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> of matter, is not a re&s;i&s;tance to a change from re&s;t to motion, or from motion to re&s;t, but a re&s;i&s;tance to acceleration or retardation, or to change of direction. If it &s;hould be alledged, that any given particle or portion of matter is carried along by virtue of the motion of the planet to which it belongs, it may be an&s;wered, that the earth or any other planet is nothing more than a congeries of &s;uch particles, each of which mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;hare of the &s;ame energy which ani|mates the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther proof of the active nature of mat|ter.</NOTE>The active nature of matter is farther proved by tho&s;e attractions and repul&s;ions which univer&s;ally take place among its parts, how|ever near or remote; and every in&s;tance of motion within the cog|ni&s;ance of our &s;en&s;es, in the bodies around us, is referrible, either in it&s;elf or its cau&s;e, to &s;ome mode of attraction or repul&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mechanical impul&s;e cannot be a primary cau&s;e of mo|tion.</NOTE> Me|chanical impul&s;e being the moil familiar cau&s;e of motion in the ordinary events of life, is apt to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;imple and original cau&s;e of it; but it is obvious, upon reflection, that it cannot originate in it&s;elf, and that all colli&s;ions are produced either by the efficiency of living animals, that is, by mu&s;cular action, or by means of &s;ome operation of nature, depending on attraction or repul&s;ion. Of the fir&s;t kind, all the mechanical operations of art are examples; and with regard to the others, they may, if care|fully inve&s;tigated, be referred in every in&s;tance, either immediately or remotely, to the above-mentioned inherent energies of matter. The natural agitation of air or water, for in&s;tance, may produce mo|tion by impul&s;e, or may bring two &s;olid bodies to impinge upon each other; but it is evident that the&s;e motions in the atmo&s;phere
<PB N="7" REF="8">or the ocean, could not take place without gravitation, which is one of the attractive powers of matter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypothe&s;is of attraction and repul&s;ion con|&s;tituting the e&s;|&s;ence of matter.</NOTE>Attraction and repul&s;ion may be con&s;idered as one principle, in|a&s;much as they are both expre&s;&s;ive of that active &s;tate originally inherent in matter, and becau&s;e any two particles, having affinity with each other, either attract or repel, according to their di&s;tance, their common temperature, and other circum&s;tances; and it is &s;o univer&s;al an agent in nature, that &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers have made it ab&s;orb, as it were, every other power and property of mat|ter. The late Father Bo&s;covich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See this doctrine fully explained, in a work entitled,</HI> Theoria nova Philo&s;ophiae naturalis redacta ad unicam legem, &amp;c. Auctore Rogerio Bo&s;covich. Venetiis, <HI>1763.</HI></NOTE>, of Milan, about forty years ago, advanced a very bold doctrine to this effect, alledging, with great &s;trength of argument, illu&s;trated by geometrical rea&s;oning, that there does not exi&s;t in nature any &s;uch thing as impenetrable ex|tended particles; and he deduces all the phaenomena of the mate|rial world from one principle, which &s;uppo&s;es it con&s;tituted of points having &s;everal &s;pheres of attraction and repul&s;ion, which be|ing variou&s;ly arranged and combined, produce the different forms and properties of matter, and its &s;everal powers, &s;uch as chemical at|traction, cohe&s;ion, and gravitation. Whether this hypothe&s;is is founded in truth or not, it would appear from the rea&s;onings made u&s;e of, that all the relative properties of matter may be accounted for, though we ab&s;tract from every other con&s;ideration but attrac|tion and repul&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;cular mo|tion cannot de|pend on any mechanical cau&s;e;</NOTE>It is evident, therefore, that whatever may be the cau&s;e of mu&s;|cular motion, it is not referrible to mechani&s;m, which is it&s;elf only
<PB N="8" REF="9">a &s;econdary principle. Some theories have had recour&s;e to the con|veyance of a fluid into the fibres of mu&s;cles, by which they were &s;welled, and thereby &s;hortened. One of the mo&s;t plau&s;ible of the&s;e hypothe&s;es &s;uppo&s;es this fluid to be the blood; but this is plainly a <HI>petitio principii;</HI> for, in order to give motion to the blood, the very power in que&s;tion is nece&s;&s;ary. Other fluids have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have this effect, but even the exi&s;tence of the&s;e has not been proved. I will not detain this learned audience with a recital of the numerous theories of this kind that have been invented by fanciful and ingenious men, only <HI>one</HI> of which can be true, and the mo&s;t &s;olid objections could be urged again&s;t them all. Other arguments, derived from the nature of irritability and &s;en&s;ibility, could, if nece&s;&s;ary, be brought to prove that Mu&s;cular Motion can|not depend on any mechanical cau&s;e: but this part of the &s;ubject was fully treated of by the ingenious Gentleman who delivered the Croonian Lecture la&s;t year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">But an origi|nal law of Na|ture.</NOTE>As it has been proved that all matter is in a &s;tate of perpetual motion, originally impre&s;&s;ed upon it by Nature, al&s;o that attraction and repul&s;ion are e&s;&s;ential to it, and the ultimate cau&s;es of all new motions that can ari&s;e in the univer&s;e, mechanical action being only a &s;econdary cau&s;e, it &s;eems mo&s;t agreeable to the analogy of nature, to refer Mu&s;cular Motion to an original law of animated matter, whereby its particles are endowed with an attractive power for which no cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned, any more than for gravitation, cohe&s;ion, or chemical affinity. If I under&s;tand it right, this was the doctrine laid down and illu&s;trated la&s;t year by Doctor Fordyce, and to which I am endeavouring to contribute &s;ome additional proofs and illu&s;trations, from a conviction that it is the only rational and philo&s;ophical light in which this &s;ubject has hitherto been viewed.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A proof of this from the in|crea&s;e power of cohe&s;ion.</NOTE>If the &s;hortening of a mu&s;cular fibre depends on this increa&s;ed power of attraction between its particles, the effect of it will be to add to the power of cohe&s;ion in the fibre, and if this &s;hall be found in fact to be the ca&s;e, it will be a farther proof of the doctrine ju&s;t now advanced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Experiment.</NOTE> In order to decide this, I made the following ex|periment upon the flexor mu&s;cle of the thumb of a man, five hours after death, while the parts were yet warm and flexible. All the parts of the joint having been &s;eparated, except the tendon, a weight was hung to it, &s;o as to act in the natural direction, and was in|crea&s;ed gradually till the mu&s;cle broke, which happened when twenty-&s;ix pounds had been appended. I found that a man of the &s;ame age, and the &s;ame apparent &s;ize and Strength, with the &s;ub|ject of the preceding experiment, could with ea&s;e lift thirty-eight pounds by the voluntary exertion of the &s;ame mu&s;cle. It is far|ther in proof of this fact, that in the ca&s;e of a violent &s;train from mu&s;cular contraction in the living body, it is the tendon that gives way, whereas we have &s;een, in the experiment ju&s;t now related, that in the dead body, the mu&s;cle is the weaker of the two. It is al&s;o well known, that in ca&s;es of over-exertion, the mu&s;cular fibres them&s;elves do not give way, though the &s;tronge&s;t tendons, such as the <HI>tendo Achillis,</HI> and even bones, such as the knee-pan, are broke by their living force<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a ca&s;e related in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, by Mr. Amyand, wherein the <HI>os humeri</HI> was broken by an exertion of the mu&s;cles. See Phil. Tran&s;. Vol. XLIII. page 252. Every one has ob&s;erved or heard of fractures happening from very &s;light accidents. The&s;e occur mo&s;t probably from a jerk of the mu&s;cles concurring with the external violence.</NOTE>, which, in &s;uch in&s;tances, mu&s;t be many times greater than the &s;trength of the dead fibres.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof from the increa&s;ed hardne&s;s.</NOTE>The &s;en&s;ible increa&s;e of hardne&s;s in a mu&s;cle, when in a &s;tate of contraction, may al&s;o be con&s;idered as a proof of an increa&s;ed attrac|tion of its particles to each other at that time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether mu&s;|cular contrac|tion produces a change of den&s;ity.</NOTE>In inve&s;tigating this &s;ubject farther, it is of importance to de|termine, whether or not a mu&s;cle, when in a &s;tate of contraction, undergoes any change of den&s;ity. A compari&s;on of it in this re|&s;pect with dead matter, may throw &s;ome light on the nature of mu&s;cular action.</P>
<P>Every homogeneous body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a certain degree of den&s;ity, determined by the di&s;tance of its integrant particles. The mo&s;t common means in nature, by which the den&s;ity of &s;uch bodies is altered, are heat and cold; the one univer&s;ally producing expan|sion, the other conden&s;ation. Whether mechanical force has the &s;ame effects is a point in natural philo&s;ophy not &s;o well a&s;certained; for though ten&s;ion and colli&s;ion produce in &s;olid ela&s;tic bodies a change of figure, which they immediately re&s;ume when the force is withdrawn, it has not been enquired, &s;o far as I know, whether in &s;uch ca&s;es, a change of den&s;ity takes place while the body is in the &s;tate of elongation or compre&s;&s;ion. Two ela&s;tic balls, in the act of colli&s;ion, undergo a momentary change of figure, &s;o that there mu&s;t be an approximation of particles in the direction in which they are flattened; and in the elongation of an ela&s;tic chord by ten&s;ion, there mu&s;t be an increa&s;ed di&s;tance of the particles in one direction, but while the&s;e changes take place in one dimen&s;ion of the re&s;pective bodies, they may be compen&s;ated by contrary changes in the other dimen&s;ions; &s;o that the &s;everal bodies may pre&s;erve, upon the whole, the &s;ame &s;olid contents. In order to a&s;certain this in the
<PB N="11" REF="12">ca&s;e of ten&s;ion, which is the only ca&s;e bearing analogy to Mu&s;cular Motion, I made the following experiment:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Experiment.</NOTE> I took a piece of the ela&s;tic gum, or <HI>kahoutchouck,</HI> three inches &s;quare, and about the eighth of an inch in thickne&s;s; I procured a piece of &s;heet-tin, three inches broad, and &s;ix inches long, cut into &s;harp teeth at each end. The gum was fir&s;t weighed in air, and found to be 380.25 grains. It was then weighed in water, along with the tin, to which it was loo&s;ely attached, and the weight of both was then 758,75 grains. The gum was then &s;tretched upon the tin, by means of the teeth at each end, to a &s;urface of about five inches &s;quare, the tin being bent &s;o as to leave a free &s;pace between it and the gum, in order that when immer&s;ed in the water, no air bub|bles might be entangled. In this &s;ituation, the weight of both in water was found to be 746,75 grains. Here was a difference of twelve grains, which could be owing only to a diminution of &s;pecific gravi|ty; and in order to be &s;ure that there was no fallacy nor inaccuracy in the experiment, the gum was immediately afterwards di&s;engaged from one end of the tin, &s;o as to allow it to &s;hrink, and being again weighed in this &s;tate in the water, it was found to have recovered exactly its former weight. This, as well as the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatical experiments, was performed by means of the exqui&s;ite balance lately invented and con&s;tructed by Mr. Ram&s;den, and belonging to Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, who politely allowed me the u&s;e of it. I was al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Gilpin, clerk of this &s;ociety, who is extremely accurate and expert in all operations of this kind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Experiments to determine whether the den&s;ity of a Mu&s;cle is af|fected by con|traction.</NOTE>Now, does the &s;tate of relaxation and contraction make in like manner a temporary difference in the den&s;ity of mu&s;cles? When the circum&s;tance of <HI>decurtation</HI> only is con&s;idered, we &s;hould be tempted to think that there mu&s;t be an approximation of the particles of the
<PB N="12" REF="13">fibre; but there is at the &s;ame time a lateral &s;welling of the mu&s;cle, which may compen&s;ate for what is lo&s;t in the other dimen&s;ion. This point cannot be decided but by an experimental examination. It might be determined whether a mu&s;cle occupies mo&s;t &s;pace when relaxed or when contracted, by finding its &s;pecific gravity in each of the&s;e &s;tates by means of the hydro&s;tatical balance. But this would be found extremely difficult; for the &s;tate of contraction is very tran&s;itory, and the motion it&s;elf would produce &s;uch a di&s;tur|bance, as would render the re&s;ult un&s;atisfactory. As there is this ob&s;tacle to the experiment on a living mu&s;cle, it occurred to me that it might be performed on the mu&s;cles of a fi&s;h, which had undergone the operation of <HI>crimping,</HI> as it is called; for, in con&s;e|quence of dividing the mu&s;cles, by cutting them when alive, they undergo a contraction, which continues after death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been made a que&s;tion, whether life and its actions may not affect the <HI>ab|&s;olute</HI> gravity of bodies? Though this doubt has not ari&s;en upon any a&s;&s;ignable grounds that I know of, unle&s;s it be that one unknown principle may affect another equally unknown, I thought it might be worth while to determine it by experiment. The fir&s;t trials were with animals of warm blood inclo&s;ed in oil&s;kin, and clo&s;e tin ve&s;&s;els, but not being &s;atisfied with the accuracy of the&s;e, from the difficulty of cutting off all communication with the external air, &s;o as to prevent moi&s;ture from exhaling, I inclo&s;ed live eels in fla&s;ks, and &s;ealed them hermetically; and, in this &s;ituation, their weight when alive being compared with their weight when dead, there did not appear any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the mere circum&s;tance of life made any difference in regard to gravity.</NOTE>; and upon comparing, by the hydro&s;tatic balance, portions of mu&s;cle which had been crimpt, with tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;ame fi&s;h, which had on purpo&s;e been &s;aved from this operation, it did not appear that there was any difference in the &s;pecific gravity. Two
<PB N="13" REF="14">trials were made, one with the ma&s;&s;eter mu&s;cles of a &s;kate, the other with the &s;ides of a large trout.</P>
<P>The following experiment was al&s;o made, in order to decide the comparative den&s;ity of a contracted and relaxed mu&s;cle. I took a gla&s;s fla&s;k, into which one half of a living eel was introduced. The mouth was immediately afterwards fu&s;ed by a blow-pipe, and drawn into a tube like the &s;tem of a thermometer. The fla&s;k and tube were then filled with water, in order to &s;ee whether the mo|tion of the animal would make the fluid rife or fall. It had neither the one effect nor the other, though there were at times &s;trong convul&s;ions, and if the mu&s;cles had at any one time occupied either more &s;pace or le&s;s than at another, a &s;en&s;ible fluctuation would have been produced, e&s;pecially when the column of fluid was rendered very fine, by the introduction of a &s;teel wire to irritate the parts. That part of the eel from the <HI>anus</HI> to the tail was made u&s;e of for this experiment, as the other divi&s;ion, containing the organs of re&s;piration and the air-bladder, might have occa&s;ioned a fallacy, from the expan&s;ion or conden&s;ation of an ela&s;tic fluid, by acciden|tal changes of temperature, or compre&s;&s;ion. This was repeated three times, with the &s;ame re&s;ult. In one of the trials, the above|mentioned portion of two eels was introduced, and though they were at times both in convul&s;ions at once, not the lea&s;t motion of the fluid in the tube could be perceived.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contraction produces no change of den|&s;ity;</NOTE>I was the more de&s;irous to be accurate in this and the preceding experiments, as the re&s;ult of them was different from my own pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the time, and different, I believe, from the opinion of mo&s;t modern phy&s;iologi&s;ts. It may &s;afely be inferred from them, that the contraction of a mu&s;cle produces no change in its den&s;ity,
<PB N="14" REF="15">and that animal life differs from inanimate matter in this re&s;pect, as well as in mo&s;t of its other properties and laws.

In the extremities of cru&s;taceous animals, for in&s;tance, which are filled with mu&s;cles, a change of den&s;ity would be apt to bur&s;t them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor of tempe|rature.</NOTE>Another circum&s;tance in which the contractions of mu&s;cles differs from &s;imple ela&s;ticity is, that the former, however frequent and violent, does not produce any heat as colli&s;ion and ten&s;ion are known to do. This may admit of &s;ome cavil with regard to ani|mals of warm blood; for, one of the theories with regard to ani|mal heat is, that it ari&s;es from the perpetual vibration of mu&s;cular fibres, particularly tho&s;e of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem; but this will not hold with re&s;pect to animals of cold blood, in which the actions of life are equally vigorous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula|tion and com|pari&s;on of facts.</NOTE>The principal phaenomena, therefore, of Mu&s;cular Motion, are the &s;hortening of the fibres, the lateral &s;well, the increa&s;e of cohe|&s;ion and hardne&s;s, and the unchanged den&s;ity and temperature. It would appear, from the two la&s;t circum&s;tances, that the intimate motions of the particles in relation to each other, mu&s;t be different from what take place in the &s;everal in&s;tances of contraction and expan&s;ion in dead bodies. In the expan&s;ion ari&s;ing from the action of heat, and the contraction from cold, the change of den&s;ity &s;hews that in the one ca&s;e, the ultimate particles mu&s;t recede from each other; and in the other ca&s;e, that they mu&s;t approach. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of ela&s;ticity. But as there is no alteration of the den|&s;ity
<PB N="15" REF="16">of a mu&s;cle in pa&s;&s;ing from relaxation to contraction, this change cannot con&s;i&s;t in the approximation of the integrant parts of the fibres, but mu&s;t depend on &s;ome other circum&s;tance in the intimate di&s;po&s;ition of the particles. In attempting to conceive in what this con&s;i&s;ts, the following explanation may be offered:&mdash;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Theory of Mu&s;cular con|traction.</NOTE> It was formerly mentioned that the regular &s;tructure of &s;olid bodies depended on the polarity and &s;hape of their integrant parts. Now all bodies, except &s;uch as are &s;phaerical, mu&s;t have a long and a &s;hort axis; and let us imagine the fibres of mu&s;cles to be compo&s;ed of &s;phaeroidal particles; we may then conceive relaxation to con&s;i&s;t in their being di&s;po&s;ed with their long axis in the line of the fibres, and contraction to con&s;i&s;t in their &s;hort axis being di&s;po&s;ed more or le&s;s in that direction. This will not only account for the de|curtation, and uniform den&s;ity, but for the lateral &s;well, and al&s;o for the increa&s;ed hardne&s;s and cohe&s;ion; for though the particles do not approach or recede, as in bodies &s;imply ela&s;tic, yet their power of attraction will be increa&s;ed by their cen|tres being brought nearer, and by being applied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By being applied, I do not mean that they are actually in <HI>contact;</HI> for it is evi|dent, from the effect of heat in expanding bodies, and of cold in conden&s;ing them, that there can be no &s;uch thing as contact of the ultimate particles of matter, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the&s;e con&s;i&s;t of impenetrable bodies infinitely hard.</NOTE> to each other by more oblate &s;urfaces. This hypothe&s;is accords with what has been before proved, concerning the unchangeable den&s;ity; for what is lo&s;t in one dimen&s;ion, is gained in another; and the cau&s;e for there being no increa&s;e of temperature, depends proba|bly on the &s;ame circum&s;tance by which the den&s;ity is pre&s;erved unaltered.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This account of Mu&s;cular Motion does not account for the operation of <HI>&s;timuli.</HI></NOTE>WHAT has been hitherto advanced on this &s;ubject, has tended only to explain that &s;tate of a mu&s;cular fibre which renders it &s;u&s;|ceptible of contraction, and to a&s;certain the nature of that change which takes place in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;tate of relaxation to that of contraction. It &s;till remains a que&s;tion by what efficient power this contraction is excited.

When the fluids only are morbidly af|fected, nature alone is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of re&s;ources of cure; for if the containing &s;olids retain their natural irritability, they will be &s;ti|mulated to expel what is extraneous or vitiated. A depraved &s;tate of the &s;olids is therefore likely to prove a more frequent cau&s;e of morbid derangement; and as they differ from the fluids, by po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing an inherent activity, it is the object of medicine to incite, re&s;train, or alter their di&s;ea&s;ed actions, according to the nature of the morbid affection.</P>
<P>It is evident, that this doctrine will admit of a much more exten&s;ive application in pathology, than there is time here to follow out; and I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the illu&s;tration of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exemplified in the ab&s;or|bents.</NOTE> in the ca&s;e of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els. The&s;e evidently po&s;&s;e&s;s a power of ab&s;orbing certain &s;ub&s;tances, and rejecting others. The lacteals, for in&s;tance, in a &s;tate of health, take up
<PB N="21" REF="22">only the nutritious part of the alimentary ma&s;s; for there is in the fecal part &s;ub&s;tances equally &s;oluble as the chyle. The inner &s;ur|face of the gall bladder is be&s;et with ab&s;orbents, which, however, do not ab&s;orb bile in the ordinary &s;tate of health, and only con|centrate it by taking up the fluid with which it is diluted. But when in con&s;equence of the ob&s;truction of the gall ducts, the blad|der becomes over di&s;tended, or when the &s;pecific perception of the ab&s;orbents is depraved by di&s;ea&s;e, in the&s;e ca&s;es the bile is ab&s;orbed and thrown into the circulation. Sometimes, &s;uch unu&s;ual actions of the ab&s;orbents are excited as a re&s;ource of nature, either to cure di&s;ea&s;e, or to carry on growth; for it has been &s;hewn by Mr. Hunter, that not only &s;oft and fluid parts, but bone, can be removed by ab&s;orp|tion. At other times, di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in affections of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, either by their action being too much retarded, as in the ca&s;e of drop&s;y, or where the matter of an ulcer, or in the pu&s;tules of the &s;mall pox, is prematurely ab&s;orbed, in con&s;equence of the depraved action of fever. It is &s;ufficiently demon&s;trable, that the whole &s;ur|face of the &s;kin and <HI>bronchiae</HI> is be&s;et with inhaling ve&s;&s;els, which ab&s;orb the fluids di&s;&s;olved in the atmo&s;phere; and it would be contrary to the analogy of the re&s;t of the body, to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome elective power, whereby they prefer or reject &s;uch fluids as are pre&s;ented to them, according to their &s;everal qualities, and that this power &s;hould not be various, ac|cording to the &s;tate of health or di&s;ea&s;e. But, independent of ana|logy, the variable &s;tate of the human body, in re&s;pect to its &s;u&s;|ceptibility of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, &s;eems to be a direct proof of this. It is a well-known fact, that a per&s;on who has never had the &s;mall pox, will at one time be clo&s;ely expo&s;ed to their infection, and
<PB N="22" REF="23">yet e&s;cape the di&s;ea&s;e, and at another time will be affected by the &s;lighte&s;t degree of it.

That the &s;tomach &s;hould be an organ of &s;o much con&s;equence, &s;eems natural enough, from the importance of its function, which is that of a&s;&s;imilation; and life can be more imme|diately and completely extingui&s;hed by an injury to it, &s;uch as a blow, than by the &s;ame violence to any other part of the body. It is al&s;o well known, that the mu&s;cular fibres of animals, endowed with a nervous &s;y&s;tem, will retain their irritability for &s;ome time after their &s;eparation from the brain and nerves. It is evident, likewi&s;e, from the <HI>phaenomena</HI> of ve|getation, that irritability may exi&s;t in nature, without &s;en&s;ation, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or any &s;u&s;picion of the exi&s;tence of a nervous &s;y&s;tem. The facts I allude to, are not only the perceptible motions of the &s;en&s;itive plant, but more particularly tho&s;e motions which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take place in all plants, in carrying on their growth; for there is no accounting for the accretion of &s;olid parts, in con&s;equence of the conveyance of nutrition by the propul&s;ion of the &s;ap, but by admitting &s;ome power, acting by laws different from tho&s;e of dead matter. In favour of this opinion, it is farther ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e animals which are de&s;titute
<PB N="25" REF="26">of brain and nerves, are of the cla&s;s <HI>vermes,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;imple in nature, having only one function, to wit, that of <HI>a&s;&s;imilation,</HI> and therefore not requiring that variety of action, and tho&s;e peculiar perceptions which are nece&s;&s;ary to more complex animals. La&s;tly, the &s;tate of an egg before incubation, and the condition of tho&s;e animals which become torpid from cold, and afterwards revive, af|ford facts which favour this opinion; as they &s;hew that there is a certain principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, independent not only of the operation of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, but even of the circulation; for, in this quie&s;cent &s;tate, the&s;e portions of animal matter are pre&s;erved for a great length of time from that corruption to which they would otherwi&s;e be liable, and their fluids are prevented from freezing in a degree of cold, which would congeal them, were they de&s;titute of every principle of life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mutual dependance of &s;imple life and nervous in|fluence.</NOTE>But though &s;imple life may be con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which is only an acce&s;&s;ary appendage to it, yet in tho&s;e animals in which they are conjoined, the purpo&s;es of nature render them dependant on each other. The functions of the brain, for in&s;tance, cannot go on without the action of the heart; for whenever the circulation of the blood is interrupted, con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ation are de&s;troyed, as is evident in the ca&s;e of a &s;woon, and in the effects of &s;trangulation. On the other hand, as has been before ob&s;erved, the action of the heart has a dependance on the influence of the nerves, as connected with the brain. There are al&s;o inconte&s;tible proofs of the extreme ve&s;&s;els being affected by the influence of the brain; for we know that a thought in the mind will produce partial determinations of the circulating fluids, as in the ca&s;e of blu&s;hing, and the fullne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els in the organs of generation, in con&s;equence of certain pa&s;&s;ions.

The opium had a double effect on the former, as it acted both upon the &s;en&s;es and upon the principle of &s;imple life, and the effect upon the &s;en&s;es was more than equivalent to the external injury of the latter, upon which the opium acted only upon one principle, the &s;en&s;es being locked up by the de&s;truction of their organs.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain in|&s;tinctive acti|ons, indepen|dent of &s;en&s;a|tion and con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</NOTE>But though in&s;tinctive motions are in &s;ome ca&s;es convertible into tho&s;e which are voluntary, we &s;ould be &s;o far from confounding them, that the former are even compatible with the want of con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ation; for tho&s;e animals which are de&s;titute of brain and nerves, are capable of actions evidently of the in&s;tinctive kind. A leech, for in&s;tance, being brought into contact with a living animal, is impelled, by an in&s;tinct of its nature, to fa&s;ten upon it, and &s;uck its blood.

It might, therefore, be &s;aid, that the &s;pinal marrow &s;erved as a &s;en&s;orium; but it may be an&s;wered, that when the head is cut off, its irritability remains, as appears by the motion of the ears, when pricked or touched with a hot wire; and as the extremities are al&s;o irritable, it will not be &s;aid that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ation exi&s;t in two &s;eparated portions of the body.</NOTE>.

<P>In what I have farther to &s;ay on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall confine my|&s;elf to the con&s;ideration of two of the mo&s;t curious and important in&s;tincts, HABIT and IMITATION.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="39">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit, as ap|plied to mu&s;|cular motion.</NOTE>It is the nature of a voluntary mu&s;cle to perform any motion greater ea&s;e, the more frequently it is repeated, and to act mo&s;t readily with tho&s;e mu&s;cles, or in company with tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations with which it has been u&s;ed to combine its action, either at once or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This is the foundation of habit, and though it is in common to man with other animals, it is the principle by which all his practical attainments acquire facility and perfection. It has been mentioned that &s;ome actions, originally in&s;tinctive, may af|terwards be performed as acts of pure volition; &s;o inver&s;ely, all ac|tions, which are the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and reflection, may be brought by habit to re&s;emble in&s;tinctive actions, and thereby to be performed with greater expedition and effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit, as ap|plied to &s;en|&s;ation.</NOTE>The term Habit has al&s;o been applied to &s;en&s;ation; for, as mo|tions are more readily excited by frequent &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;o one per|ception excites the idea of another, in con&s;equence of repeated connection. In this &s;en&s;e, it ought more properly to be called the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, a principle upon which Dr. Hartley has built a theory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This work has been re-publi&s;hed, with a preface, by Dr. Prie&s;tley.</NOTE> of the human mind, perhaps the mo&s;t ju&s;t and con&s;i&s;t|ent of any that has ever been framed. It is habit, taken in this &s;en&s;e al&s;o, which Mr. Hume<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays and Treati&s;es on various &s;ubjects, Vol. III. by David Hume, E&s;q.</NOTE> conceives to be the foundation of all our experimental rea&s;oning, ina&s;much as it con&s;titutes the only original notices by which we acquire any intimation of the con|nection of cau&s;e and effect. But though this doctrine is ably and profoundly illu&s;trated by that philo&s;opher, it may be remarked, independently of other objections, that though habit may <HI>give no|tice</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40">of this connection, it cannot <HI>con&s;titute</HI> it; for animals, whe|ther rational or irrational, would be made &s;u&s;ceptible of habit in vain, unle&s;s the con&s;titution of external nature had been made to corre&s;pond with it; ju&s;t as the eye would have been made in vain, had there not exi&s;ted &s;uch a body as light. Now, in what does this corre&s;pondence con&s;i&s;t? It con&s;i&s;ts in that principle whereby nature acts by invariable laws; for it is evident, that if the laws of nature were variable, tho&s;e recurrences of perceptions in which habit con&s;i&s;ts, and on which all experience is built, could not take place; and this &s;ort of contingency would al&s;o de&s;troy all tho&s;e principles by which prudence and &s;kill operate upon external objects, for the purpo&s;es either of common life or of &s;cience. The faculty, therefore, by which animals are &s;u&s;ceptible of that &s;ort of habit which con&s;i&s;ts in the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, may be termed the organ whereby animals perceive the uniform &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;e and ef|fect, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the invariable cour&s;e of nature. It was nece&s;|&s;ary that this &s;hould be an in&s;tinct, for the &s;ake of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation, not only to mere animals, but to the human &s;pecies in in|fancy. If the noxious effects of fire, and the various modes of mechanical violence, &s;uch as falls and blows, were only to be learnt by a proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, all animals would peri&s;h before they could attain to maturity. The great difference of man and mere animals in this re&s;pect, &s;eems to be, that the latter only per|ceive the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, when the objects them&s;elves are pre&s;ent to their &s;en&s;es, whereas the former, by being endowed with memory, can reflect upon them, and render them &s;ub&s;ervient to experience: for, with regard to external bodies, what is rea&s;on, but the remembrance of objects as they affect each other, and the application of this knowledge to the practice of life, in ad|ju&s;ting means to ends? The principal difference of one man
<PB N="40" REF="41">from another, in point of under&s;tanding, con&s;i&s;ts in the readine&s;s with which the mind forms the&s;e combinations, and the &s;trength with which it can guard again&s;t &s;uch as are accidental and fanciful, and di&s;criminate the&s;e from &s;uch as have an archetype in the nature of things; and that mind, of which the conceptions cor|re&s;pond be&s;t with the real a&s;&s;ociations of nature, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cor|rect judgement and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, the mo&s;t valuable of all men|tal attainments.</P>
<P>It would lead to di&s;qui&s;itions too long and too intricate, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, foreign to this place, to enlarge farther on the va|rious effects of the combination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Theory of the Moods of Verbs, by Dr. Gregory. Phil. Tran&s;. Edin. 1790.</NOTE> and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a Treati&s;e on Time, by Dr. Wat&s;on, jun. F. R. S. Lond. 1785.</NOTE> of ideas which connect animal with intellectual nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corre&s;pon|dence between the properties and laws of ex|ternal nature and the facul|ties of animals.</NOTE> I &s;hall only remark, that tho&s;e internal faculties upon which habit and a&s;&s;ociation depend, carry a reference to external nature, exactly analogous to the mu|tual relation formerly mentioned as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between <HI>&s;timuli,</HI> whether internal or external, and the moving powers corre&s;pond|ing to them, and between the organs of &s;en&s;e, and the impre&s;&s;ions of external bodies which are naturally adapted to them. Mu&s;cular motion and &s;en&s;ation have relation to the &s;ingle properties of mat|ter, as they affect particular fibres and organs, but habit and a&s;&s;o|ciation are co-relative to that &s;tated connection of cau&s;e and effect, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the general laws of nature. We can thus trace a corre&s;pondenee between the motions, &s;en&s;ations, and faculties of animals, on one hand, and the properties of matter on the other hand, from the lowe&s;t limits of animal and even vegetable nature,
<PB N="41" REF="42">into the boundaries of intelligence. The &s;ame accordance with the laws of nature is ob&s;ervable in the &s;tructure of animals, as in their motions and functions, as may be examplified by that reference to the powers of gravitation which is evident in the conformation of the limbs and the po&s;ition of the vi&s;cera, as adapted to the na|tural motions and po&s;ture of the body.</P>
<P>It would appear, therefore, that there is a co-ordinance or <HI>pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed harmony,</HI> as it were, between the faculties of animals and the laws of external matter, which is the foundation of all the in|&s;tinctive habits of animals, as well as the rational conduct of man; and it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;ufficiently to admire that &s;ublime contrivance by which the frame of animated beings is thus in all points adapted to the con&s;titution of inanimate nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit as appli|ed to tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es which af|fect but once in life.</NOTE>There &s;till remains to be mentioned another circum&s;tance in the animal oeconomy, which has been referred to the law of habit. It is the nature of tho&s;e morbid poi&s;ons called &s;pecific contagions, &s;uch as the infectious matter of the &s;mall-pox, not to produce their pe|culiar effect more than once in life; and this has been imputed to habit, from the &s;imilarity of it to what happens with re&s;pect to ex|ternal impre&s;&s;ions, the frequency and long continuance of which tend to produce the want of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility. Upon whatever principle this property of the animal oeconomy depends, it is an undoubted fact that the&s;e morbid poi&s;ons, after exciting a certain degree of di&s;turbance, and a certain &s;eries of di&s;ea&s;ed actions, no longer make any impre&s;&s;ion on the powers of life, otherwi&s;e there could be no &s;uch thing as recovery; for at the time in which a per&s;on begins to recover from the &s;mall-pox, the poi&s;on, actually pre&s;ent in the circulating &s;y&s;tem, is multiplied infinitely beyond
<PB N="42" REF="43">what it was when it excited the di&s;ea&s;e. The con&s;titution has therefore, at that time, with re&s;pect to this acrimony, acquired an in&s;en&s;ibility, or rather want of irritability, and this it pre&s;erves ever afterwards. This holds only with regard to tho&s;e morbid poi&s;ons which excite febrile affections, and &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ary provi|&s;ion of nature to guard again&s;t &s;uch noxious principles as are gene|rated within the body it&s;elf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IMITATION.</NOTE>The other in&s;tinct that remains to be con&s;idered, is Imitation. This is an action of which &s;ome brutes of no great &s;agacity are ca|pable, and yet it is the foundation of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important attainments of rational beings, particularly &s;peech, which could not otherwi&s;e be acquired, and without which the powers of rea&s;on would be extremely limited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;ome ingenious ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject in Dr. Campbell's Philo&s;ophy of Rhetoric, Book II. chap. vii.
<P>Speech &s;eems to be to thought what writing is to &s;peech, or rather what arith|metical or algebraical computation is to common language, whether &s;poken or writte; for without &s;peech the operation of the mind, particularly that of ab&s;trac|tion, would be extremely limited, nor could there be any of tho&s;e exten&s;ive combi|nations of thought which con&s;titute a chain of rea&s;oning. It would appear from this, and from the remark in page 39, that all the operations of the human mind are founded on &s;en&s;ation, habit, memory, and &s;peech.</P></NOTE>. In the early part of human life, imitation &s;eems equally independent of rea&s;on and reflection, as in mere animals. It takes place not only without the operation of the will, but in oppo&s;ition to it; for yawning is an involuntary &s;pa&s;m of the mu&s;cles of the jaw, which is frequently excited by a &s;ight of the &s;ame action in others; and there is a ca&s;e recorded in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, by Dr. Garden<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. Vol. XII. p. 842.</NOTE>, of a man who, in his adult &s;tate, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rea&s;on, imitated involuntarily and irre|&s;i&s;tibly
<PB N="43" REF="44">whatever ge&s;tures he &s;aw in others. We are to account, on the &s;ame principle, for that general &s;imilarity of external manner and of accent ob&s;ervable in particular &s;ocieties and nations, and which all men in&s;en&s;ibly acquire in a greater or le&s;s degree.</P>
<P>The only objects of imitation, are ge&s;tures and &s;ounds. The imitation of ge&s;tures &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, le&s;s unaccountable than that of &s;ounds; for it is performed by members which are objects of &s;ight, and would therefore &s;eem more ea&s;ily transferable to the corre&s;ponding parts of another per&s;on; whereas the organs of voice are &s;o hidden and minute, that we can have no knowledge of what parts are put in motion in order to produce &s;ound. But upon far|ther reflection, there &s;eems little or no difference in this re&s;pect; for, independently of anatomy, we know nothing of mu&s;cles but by their effects; and there &s;eems no rea&s;on why the ear being af|fected by a &s;ound, &s;hould not excite a given motion in the mu&s;cles of the larynx and fauces, as well as that a ge&s;ture, by having its image impre&s;&s;ed on the retina, &s;hould excite motions in the legs or arms. Even where imitation, or any other action, is the re&s;ult of deliberate volition in rational beings, the motion is not performed from a knowledge of their having mu&s;cles. They only <HI>will</HI> the effect, without knowing by what means it is performed; for though it may &s;eem obvious that all the motions of an animal are effected by the &s;hortening of the fle&s;hy fibres, this is a fact with which tho&s;e only are acquainted who have &s;ome knowledge of ana|tomy and phy&s;iology, and may be con&s;idered as a fundamental and fir&s;t-rate di&s;covery in the natural hi&s;tory of the living body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This di&s;covery cannot be traced to any particular improver of phy&s;iology, but &s;eems to have ari&s;en, like many other di&s;coveries in &s;cience and the arts, rather from the gradual evolution of knowledge than the efforts of any individual. It has at all times been ob&s;erved, that exertions of &s;trength produce a &s;welling and mo|tion in the fle&s;hy parts of the extremities, and the word denoting a mu&s;cle in different languages, is taken from the re&s;emblance of the motions under the &s;kin to tho&s;e of a little nimble animal, &s;uch as a mou&s;e or a lizard. A mu&s;cle is called in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, in Latin <HI>mu&s;culus,</HI> or <HI>lacertus,</HI> and that mu&s;cle which is &s;o vi&s;ible near the ham of a quadruped when walking, is, in the common language of &s;ome parts of the country, called the <HI>mou&s;e.</HI> It is not a&s;certained, &s;o far as I know, who fir&s;t a&s;cribed the mo|tions of animals to the contraction of fle&s;hy fibres. There is no mention made of this in the works of Hippocrates, but it is very clearly &s;tated by Galen; &s;o that the di&s;covery &s;eems to have been made in &s;ome intervening period. This property of mu&s;cles is &s;o well a&s;certained in modern times, that wherever we &s;ee a mu&s;cular &s;ub|&s;tance, we infer &s;ynthetically that &s;ome corre&s;ponding function mu&s;t belong to it; and we find an irrefragable argument for the circulation of the blood, only from con&s;idering the heart as a mu&s;cular &s;ub&s;tance. This &s;ubject has not been well un|der&s;tood till modern times, otherwi&s;e the circulation would mo&s;t probably have been di&s;covered &s;ooner; and even &s;ince this di&s;covery, we find &s;ome phy&s;iologi&s;ts &s;o little acquainted with the nature of mu&s;cular power, that they have invented a fanciful theory of the motion of the blood, by a &s;uppo&s;ed fermentation taking place in the cavity of the heart. We are chiefly indebted to Dr. Gli&s;&s;on, who lived about the middle of the la&s;t century, for the fir&s;t correct ideas of the irritability and contracti|lity of mu&s;cular fibres.</NOTE>.</P>

With regard to the inte&s;tines, it may be mentioned, among many other proofs, that it is common for per&s;ons in a &s;tate of great weak|ne&s;s to be affected with &s;yncope, and even in&s;tantaneous death, in the act of evacuating the bowels. It &s;eems to be from a like cau&s;e that a temporary lowne&s;s is produced by an ab&s;ce&s;s being opened. This principle of the animal oeconomy has been better illu&s;trated by Dr. Cullen than any other phy&s;iologi&s;t; and he is of opinion, that great part of the effect of blood-letting in taking off the ten&s;ion of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, in ca&s;es of inflammation, depends on the depletion of the ve&s;&s;els of the part from whence the blood is taken, for the pro|portion of the quantity drawn to the whole ma&s;s is very &s;mall; and it may al&s;o be urged in favour of this opinion, that the more &s;udden|ly the evacuation is made, the more effectual is its operation in re|moving the inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition, ina&s;much as the local de|pletion will be greater, the le&s;s time is allowed for the balance of the &s;y&s;tem to replace it.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;cular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o|tion con&s;ider|ed mechani|cally.</NOTE>WHAT has been hitherto &s;aid of Mu&s;cular Motion, has had relation to it as a property peculiar to animal matter and animal life. What I have farther to add on this &s;ubject, will relate to the mu&s;cles merely as mechanical powers. As they con&s;titute the &s;trength of animals, it may be proper to con&s;ider the relation of their force to their bulk, and the relation of the bulk and &s;trength of the body to the den&s;ity and cohe&s;ion of its own materials, and to the bulk, den&s;ity, and cohe&s;ion of the external inanimate bodies with which it is conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>It has been demon&s;trated by Galileo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Opere di Galileo. Di&s;cor&s;i e demon&s;trazione mathematiche.</NOTE>, that in &s;imilar unequal bodies of a cylindrical or pri&s;matic &s;hape, &s;uch as the limbs of ani|mals nearly are, the ratio of their efforts to break by their own weight, is in the quadruplicate ratio of their lengths, but that the re&s;i&s;tance they make to the &s;ame force is only in the triplicate ratio of their lengths. It follows from this, that in order to endow the limbs of animals with the &s;ame relative force, it is not only nece&s;|&s;ary that the bones &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s an encrea&s;ed proportion of thick|ne&s;s, in order to give an adequate increa&s;e of what may be called the dead &s;trength, but a &s;imilar increa&s;e of living &s;trength will be nece&s;&s;ary, by a &s;uitable addition of mu&s;cular power, in order to keep pace with the increa&s;ed &s;ize of the bones. Now we ob&s;erve, in fact, that in the large-&s;ized animals, &s;uch as the bull and the elephant, the thickne&s;s both of their bones and mu&s;cles bears a greater proportion to the length of their limbs, than in the &s;maller animals, and they are therefore of a le&s;s elegant form. But Nature has not carried this &s;o far, as to compen&s;ate for the di&s;advantage
<PB N="49" REF="50">ari&s;ing from the increa&s;e of &s;ize; for the greater animals have not the &s;ame proportional &s;trength, in relation to their bulk, that the &s;maller animals have. It has been computed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Haller Elementa Phy&s;iologiae. Cap. IX. Sect. II.</NOTE> that a flea can draw from &s;eventy to eighty times its own weight, whereas a hor&s;e cannot with ea&s;e draw more than three times his own weight. This di&s;proportion between &s;trength and &s;ize is very ob&s;ervable in different individuals of the human &s;pecies, when compared to each other; for tall men are not mu&s;cular, even in the &s;imple propor|tion of their &s;tature. The difference in the &s;hape and &s;ize of different men may be con&s;idered as an accidental variety, or <HI>lu&s;us naturae,</HI> owing, probably, to his artificial mode of life, and for which Na|ture has made no &s;pecial provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;trength and &s;tature of the body pro|perly adapted to external na|ture.</NOTE>We are led, however, from a view of the &s;ame mechanical prin|ciples, to perceive the wi&s;dom of Nature in a&s;&s;igning certain gene|ral limits to the &s;tature of the human body. Had man been made much larger, he would have been unwieldy, and &s;ubject to acci|dents in his motions, in con&s;equence of the <HI>momentum</HI> of the parts increa&s;ing in a higher ratio than their power of re&s;i&s;tance. It may be an&s;wered, that the parts might have been made proportionally more hard and tenacious. But there are other circum&s;tances in the animal oeconomy which would have been a bar to this; for had the bones been harder, they would not have been calculated for the common duration of life, the effect of which being to increa&s;e their hardne&s;s and dryne&s;s, they mu&s;t be endowed originally with a certain degree of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;ucculence. And with regard to mu&s;cles, a degree of hardne&s;s, much greater than they naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s, would have been incompatible with their contractility.
<PB N="50" REF="51">Another inconvenience of the greater &s;tature of man would be, that he would require larger habitations, more food and clothing, while he would have le&s;s relative &s;trength to provide for the&s;e wants. On the other hand, had man been of a &s;tature much le&s;s than what he enjoys by nature, he would not have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient power over external objects, to act up to tho&s;e &s;uperior faculties of mind with which he is endowed. If nature had conferred on man only one half of his actual &s;tature and &s;trength, with the &s;ame powers of rea&s;on, we may venture to affirm that he would not have carried his dominion over nature to the &s;ame extent. As he is now con|&s;tituted, his force being commen&s;urate with external nature, he has been able, either by force or artifice, to a&s;&s;ert his &s;overeignty over the woods and fields, by ma&s;tering the &s;tronge&s;t and fierce&s;t wild bea&s;ts; he has been able to change the whole face of nature on the &s;urface of the earth, by works of indu&s;try, and monuments of art; he has been able to fell trees, to build &s;hips, and to circumnavi|gate the planet he inhabits. It is rather a triumph of his rea&s;on than of his corporeal &s;trength, to &s;ay, in the language of a modern poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></NOTE>, that he can <Q>"Mea&s;ure earth, weigh air, and &s;tate the tides;"</Q> or, according to the &s;ublime idea of an ancient philo&s;opher<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Archimedes.</NOTE>, that he could turn the earth from its orbit, could he find footing on another earth, from whence to exert the powers of mechani&s;m; but &s;uch knowledge and &s;uch conceptions could never have been attained but by a being of a certain degree of bodily &s;trength and &s;tature.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it may &s;afely be inferred, that as the external bodies with which we are conver&s;ant po&s;&s;e&s;s given degrees
<PB N="51" REF="52">of cohe&s;ion, bulk, and den&s;ity, which require corre&s;ponding powers to act upon them; &s;o the human body, at its mean &s;tature, is be&s;t adapted for producing tho&s;e changes upon matter, which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and the various accommodations of life. And an argument may be drawn from hence again&s;t the te|nets of tho&s;e &s;peculative philo&s;ophers, who hold that the &s;ize and &s;trength of man were much greater in remote antiquity than in mo|dern times. It is evident, from what has been &s;aid, that if the bulk of the human body were much greater than it is, it would be both u&s;ele&s;s and inconvenient, and would not pre&s;erve that har|mony with the re&s;t of nature, which is &s;o agreeable to the analogy of her other works.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mu&s;cles con&s;idered as mechanical powers acting upon levers.</NOTE>I &s;hall conclude this Lecture with &s;ome remarks on the mu&s;cles, con&s;idered as mechanical powers acting upon levers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark to be made upon this, is &s;o obvious, that it has hardly e&s;caped the notice of any modern phy&s;iologi&s;t, and &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight to militate again&s;t that wi&s;dom of nature which is &s;o con&s;pi|cuous in other re&s;pects. What I mean is, the great wa&s;te of mecha|nical power which is incurred by the manner in which the mu&s;cles are in&s;erted into the bones.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their di&s;ad|vantageous ac|tion, 1. From the manner of their in&s;ertion into the bones.</NOTE> This di&s;advantageous action of mu&s;cles is chiefly owing to two circum&s;tances. One of the&s;e is their in&s;ertion, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance in which they are connected with bones, into a part which is much nearer the fulcrum than the re&s;i&s;tance. Thus the two mu&s;cles of the arm, called the <HI>biceps</HI> and <HI>brachiaeus internus,</HI> in order to &s;upport in the hand a weight of one pound with the fore arm at right angles to the <HI>humerus,</HI> mu&s;t exert a power equal to ten pounds. The other circum&s;tance giving ri&s;e to a wa&s;te of power, is the great obliquity with which they are in&s;erted into
<PB N="52" REF="53">the bones upon which they are intended to act, &s;o that the greater part of the force is expended in pre&s;&s;ing one bone again&s;t another at the articulation, and only a &s;mall portion of it in making the flexures and exten&s;ions; &s;o as to produce the de&s;ired effect at the extre|mity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This compen|&s;ated by pre|&s;erving the &s;hape of the parts,</NOTE>But the&s;e di&s;advantages are compen&s;ated by certain conveniences, and if nature has endowed the mu&s;cles with &s;ufficient power for the purpo&s;es of life, after making allowance for the wa&s;te of force, there can be no rea&s;on to find fault with her management. One of the principal advantages ari&s;ing from this di&s;tribution of the mu&s;cles, is the pre&s;ervation of the &s;hape of the members; for un|le&s;s the mu&s;cles and tendons had been pretty nearly in the direction of the bones, they mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed like bow-&s;trings from one bone to another, in making the flexures of the joints.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and in actions of percu&s;&s;ion,</NOTE>In e&s;timating the wa&s;te of force, in con&s;equence of the mecha|nical di&s;advantages before mentioned, we are to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e actions which con&s;i&s;t in pre&s;&s;ure, and tho&s;e which con&s;i&s;t in percu&s;&s;ion; for as the <HI>momentum</HI> of the latter depends on velocity, it is evident that there is a great advantage from the in&s;ertion of the tendon being near the centre of motion, as greater velocity, with le&s;s expence of contraction, will be thereby imparted to the extre|mity. The mu&s;cles, for in&s;tance, which are attached to the <HI>olecra|non,</HI> in performing tho&s;e actions with the hand which require rub|bing, act with a di&s;advantage, exactly in proportion to the inequa|lity of the di&s;tance from their in&s;ertion to the joint of the elbow, and that from the &s;ame joint to the hand. This is an act of pre&s;|&s;ure. But in the ca&s;e of percu&s;&s;ion, as in the action of u&s;ing a
<PB N="53" REF="54">hammer, there is an evident advantage re&s;ulting from the velocity communicated to the extremity; for in order to have produced the &s;ame velocity, with the in&s;ertion at a greater di&s;tance from the centre of motion, a greater range of contraction would have been nece&s;&s;ary.<NOTE PLACE="marg">by &s;aving con|traction.</NOTE> The &s;aving of contraction, therefore, may be reckoned another principal advantage in the attachment of mu&s;cles near to the centre of motion. As this is a point which I think has not been attended to, in explaining the mechani&s;m of the mu&s;cles, I &s;hall conclude with &s;ome remarks upon it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Di&s;advan|tage from the obliquity of mu&s;cles to each other.</NOTE>As the mu&s;cles of voluntary motion are &s;ubject to fatigue, every circum&s;tance that can tend to dimini&s;h this, will be favourable to the purpo&s;es of nature. Fatigue depends upon the force, fre|quency, duration, and extent of the contraction of mu&s;cular fibres. It is this la&s;t which is meant here to be illu&s;trated. If any one will take the trouble of comparing the fatigue of the <HI>biceps</HI> mu&s;cle, in bearing a weight in the hand, with the elbow joint bent to a right angle, with that of bearing the &s;ame weight for the &s;ame length of time, with the joint at an acute angle, he will be &s;en&s;ible how much the degree of fatigue depends on the extent of contraction, and by attending to the relative &s;ituation of mu&s;cular fibres, it will appear that nature, in di&s;tributing the fibres of mu&s;cles obliquely, has had it in view not only to increa&s;e their number, but to &s;ave contraction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oblique ac|tion univer&s;al in mu&s;cles, in relation to each other.</NOTE>In &s;urveying the actions of all the various mu&s;cles, it appears, not only from the co-operation of different mu&s;cles, but from the po&s;ition of the fibres in the &s;ame mu&s;cle, that there is hardly an action to be met with that can be called direct. In &s;ome in&s;tances, two mu&s;cles, or &s;ets of mu&s;cles, are made to co-operate, &s;o that
<PB N="54" REF="55">the motion effected by them &s;hall be in the diagonal of their direc|tion. This is the ca&s;e of the oblique mu&s;cles of the abdomen in &s;ome of their actions, and the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles in all their actions. Sometimes, different portions of the &s;ame mu&s;cle produce in like manner an intermediate and combined effect, as in the in&s;tance of the <HI>cucullaris,</HI> one part of which being attached to the <HI>vertebrae</HI> of the neck, and another to tho&s;e of the lower part of the back, their joint effect is to draw the <HI>&s;capula</HI> towards the &s;pine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and in the fi|bres of the &s;ame mu&s;cle.</NOTE> And in all the long mu&s;cles, however &s;imple their origin and in&s;ertion may be, there is an internal obliquity of their fibres, in regard to each other, as de&s;cribed by the late Dr. Hunter; for the&s;e do not run from end to end, but there are parts of the tendon running into the belly of the mu&s;cle, &s;o as to divide it into penniform and rhomboidal por|tions. This di&s;tribution of the fibres takes off from their length; but as it takes place in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the origin and in&s;ertion are at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, this can be afforded;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compen&s;ated, 1. by multi|plying the number of fibres.</NOTE> and this, as well as the wa&s;te of power, in con&s;equence of oblique action, is more than compen&s;ated by the increa&s;ed &s;trength, from the fibres being mul|tiplied; for, in con&s;equence of this &s;tructure, there is an extent of tendon afforded &s;ufficient for the in&s;ertion of a greater quantity of fle&s;hy fibres.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This illu&s;trat|ed in the &s;truc|ture of fi&s;h.</NOTE>This principle in the mechani&s;m of mu&s;cular action, is well il|lu&s;trated by con&s;idering the motions of fi&s;h. The mu&s;cles of mo&s;t fi&s;h con&s;i&s;t of regular &s;eries of oblique &s;hort fibres, forming tho&s;e <HI>&s;trata</HI> which every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved in their mu&s;cular &s;ub|&s;tance. Their motions are more &s;imple and limited than tho&s;e of land animals, but much more vigorous; for a fi&s;h in the &s;ea has to make its way through a medium about a thou&s;and times more den&s;e than
<PB N="55" REF="56">air, and with more rapidity. Nature, therefore, in&s;tead of giving them mu&s;cles who&s;e fibres would run &s;traight from one end of their body to the other, has multiplied their numbers, by di&s;tri|buting them into &s;hort and oblique portions. If one was called upon to name in&s;tances of the greate&s;t mu&s;cular efforts, it is in fi&s;h that the&s;e are to be found. I have &s;een the &s;word of a &s;word-fi&s;h &s;ticking in a plank, which it had penetrated from &s;ide to &s;ide; and when it is con&s;idered that the animal was then moving through &s;o den&s;e a medium, and in the &s;ame direction with the &s;hip, we mu&s;t form a high conception of its mu&s;cular power.</P>
<P>An advantage the rever&s;e of what has been &s;tated, ari&s;es from the oblique direction of the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles, the fibres of which are thereby lengthened; for in parts &s;o near each other as the ribs, there would have been a great inconvenience in their pa&s;&s;ing di|rectly from one to another. Be&s;ides, in con&s;equence of their oblique direction, the origin in the &s;uperior rib is placed nearer to the centre of motion than the in&s;ertion in the inferior rib, the ef|fect of which is, that all the ribs are elevated, whereby the cavity of the thorax is enlarged, which is the view of nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. By &s;aving contraction.</NOTE>But the advantage or rather compen&s;ation of obliquity, which I mean particularly here to demon&s;trate, is, that the &s;ame effect is pro|duced with a le&s;s proportional decurtation of fibres, than if the &s;ame motion had been performed by a direct power. Borelli has e&s;timated geometrically the lo&s;s of power from oblique action, but &s;eems to have overlooked this compen&s;ation of it, which is not incon&s;iderable, when we reflect that there is thereby a &s;aving of contraction, and con&s;equently of fatigue. This can be rendered an object of geo|metrical
<PB N="56" REF="57">proof, and I here &s;ubjoin a demon&s;tration of it, which I made out, when engaged in the &s;tudy of anatomy, eighteen years ago.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This demon|&s;trated by a theorem.</NOTE>Let the line A B, in the annexed diagram, repre&s;ent a moveable bone, and the line C D a fixed bone parallel to it. Let F E, per|pendicular to the&s;e lines, repre&s;ent a mu&s;cle acting in its own di|rection, and the lines G E H E repre&s;ent two mu&s;cles acting ob|liquely, and producing, by a diagonal action, the &s;ame effect as the other, If the bone A B be brought to the &s;ituation <HI>a b,</HI> by the action of the mu&s;cle F E, the mu&s;cle will then be in the &s;ituation F K. If the bone is brought into the &s;ame &s;ituation by the action of the mu&s;cles G E, H E, the&s;e mu&s;cles will then be in the &s;ituation G K, H K.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>The propo&s;ition to be demon&s;trated is, that the line G K bears a greater proportion to the line G E, than the line F K does to line F E; for F K is to F E as G L is to G E. (Euc. Elem. B. vi. Prop. 2.) and the angle E L K, being le&s;s than a right angle, the angle G L K, which is adjacent to it, mu&s;t be greater than a right angle; and the angle G K L, being in the &s;ame triangle with G L K, mu&s;t be le&s;s than a right angle. The line G K, therefore, which &s;ubtends the greater angle, is greater than the line G L, &s;ub|tending the le&s;&s;er, and therefore bears a greater proportion to G E. But the line G L is to G E, as F K is to F E; and therefore G K
<PB N="57" REF="58" MS="y">bears a greater proportion to G E, than F K does to F E; that is, the fibres of the mu&s;cles acting obliquely, &s;uffer a le&s;s proportional decurtation than tho&s;e of the mu&s;cle acting directly.</P>
<P>It is farther obvious, that the more oblique the action becomes, the greater &s;aving there will be of contraction; for in moving the line <HI>a b</HI> towards C D, the line F K dimini&s;hes in a &s;wifter ratio than the line G K, and when the former has vani&s;hed, the latter is in the &s;ituation G F.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu&s;ion.</NOTE>I have thus endeavoured to &s;ketch &s;ome of the mo&s;t important particular in the natural motions of living animals, a &s;ubject which affords one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t fertile fields for contemplating the wi&s;dom with which Nature adapts her means to her ends; and which has been ju&s;tly con&s;idered as carrying the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible evidence of the exi&s;tence of an intelligent cau&s;e. The &s;ubject is &s;o far from being exhau&s;ted, that I am convinced there are circum|&s;tances in the relative di&s;tribution and corre&s;pondence of organs, depending on mu&s;cular motion, &s;o profound and exqui&s;ite, as far to exceed the utmo&s;t reach of human thought to comprehend, or of human ingenuity to detect: and here, as in every other part of the frame of the univer&s;e, the mo&s;t elevated conceptions which the mo&s;t rapturous imagination can form of the beauty and magnificence of Nature, will fall far &s;hort of the real &s;ublimity of her works.</P>
