<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Publication of the follow|ing <HI>Lecture,</HI> read by your Com|mand, is owing in great mea&s;ure to the Reque&s;t of &s;everal of the <HI>Faculty</HI> and others, who heard it; but chief|ly to YOUR De&s;ire, which as &s;oon as com|municated bore with me the Authority of a Command. For HE, who by his OWN La|bours has brought &s;o much Honour to the Profe&s;&s;ion in general, has an undoubted Right, I think, to that of every Member in the particular Body of which he is the HEAD. Accordingly I have ventur'd to
<PB REF="5">expo&s;e it to publick Cen&s;ure; which from the many Defects in it, I take for granted, will be &s;evere enough: However I dar'd not do even this without fir&s;t putting it under your Patronage; well knowing that if you pronounce favourably upon it, who from your exten&s;ive Knowledge, and large Expe|rience, are &s;o de&s;ervedly eminent, the Gene|rality will &s;often their Reflections.</P>
<P>YOU cannot be &s;urpriz'd, Sir, that I &s;hould be de&s;irous of Your Protection, if you will but reflect on Your Merit, and the Character You bear in the World. One, who has made ALL NATURE his Study, has outgone the mo&s;t emulating of his Co|temporaries both at Home and Abroad, bears &s;uch a Sway in the <HI>Phy&s;ical World,</HI> without caballing for a Reputation, or u&s;ing the low Methods too frequently taken to rai&s;e one, mu&s;t &s;urely be a de&s;irable Patron: and if this Pittance of a Performance happens to plea&s;e you as much in the Reading, as it
<PB REF="6">to do upon Hearing it, I flatter my &s;elf that it will meet with your Approbation.</P>
<P>IN Di&s;cour&s;es of this &s;ort much <HI>Novelty</HI> is not to be expected; the De&s;ign of them being to &s;et before the Audience in a clear Light and narrow Compa&s;s the STATED Rules and ESTABLISH'D Laws of the Science they treat of, as well as to communicate what may have occurr'd to private Ob&s;ervation: If therefore the De&s;cription of the Parts is ju&s;t, their U&s;es and Powers properly a&s;certain'd, the Di&s;tempers incident to them rightly in|ve&s;tigated, it is &s;ufficient. This will an|&s;wer the De&s;ign of the FOUNDER, which if I have &s;ucceeded in, it will be lucky; if any thing is advanc'd be&s;ides, that may be of U&s;e to the <HI>Students</HI> of the <HI>Science,</HI> I &s;hall be very well pleas'd; and if the Per|formance upon the Whole is not &s;o mean as to be a <HI>Di&s;grace</HI> to that Learned BODY, of which I am a Member, and who&s;e Ho|nour I hold in the greate&s;t E&s;timation, I &s;hall be fully &s;atisfy'd.</P>

<P>_IN pur&s;uance to the In&s;titution of this Lecture, which obliges me to read upon &s;ome particular Parts of the Body, and upon two or more Di&s;|tempers that are incident to &s;uch Parts, I have pitch'd upon tho&s;e that are form'd for the Separation of the Urine, or are immediately &s;ub&s;ervient to it afterwards in its Pa&s;&s;age out of the Body: which I have taken more out of Nece&s;&s;ity than Choice; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Organs having been treated of already by &s;ome of our learned Members, who&s;e Notions and Ob&s;ervations I can't pretend to amend. To this purpo&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary, before I enter upon the Di&s;ea&s;es that affect them, to give an <HI>Anatomical</HI> De&s;cription of the <HI>&V;rinary Pa&s;&s;ages,</HI> and to en|quire into the Nature of the Fluid &s;ecreted by them, and flow|ing through them; as the Knowledge of the&s;e will lead us to
<PB N="2" REF="9">the <HI>&V;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> peculiar to each, and thereby inform us in great mea&s;ure, by what means they become &s;o alter'd and vitiated, as to produce the <HI>Di&s;tempers</HI> we &s;hall give an account of: And by &s;uch a Method, as I take it, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>GULSTON.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Founder's</HI> De&s;ign will be be&s;t an&s;wer'd, in ordering this Lecture to be read over a <HI>human Body.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t then that are concern'd, and pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our In&s;pection, are the <HI>Kidneys:</HI> which, as is commonly known, are <HI>&s;ituate</HI> in a duplicature of the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> one on each &s;ide; the right between the <HI>Liver</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;culus Lumbaris,</HI> or <HI>P&s;oas;</HI> the left between the <HI>Spleen</HI> and the &s;ame Mu&s;cle on that &s;ide. In human Subjects the Right is plac'd lower than the Left, in order to make more room for the large <HI>Vi&s;cus</HI> of the <HI>Liver,</HI> as in Brutes frequently the contrary; not only as the prone Situation of their Bodies does not require &s;uch a Po&s;ition, the Liver in them projecting forwards and downwards, and thence leaving a greater Space for the right Kidney; but becau&s;e the&s;e Animals being very voracious, their Stomachs are often &s;o di&s;|tended with Food, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to place the left Kid|ney lower, to prevent its being compre&s;s'd by this Organ (toge|ther with the Spleen) during &s;o great a Di&s;ten&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Kidneys are <HI>cover'd</HI> with two Coats or Membranes; the exterior of which is borrow'd from the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> and en|velops them but loo&s;ely, generally abounding with Fat; which not only lubricates their Surface, but forms a proper <HI>Nidus,</HI> wherein they lay &s;ecure from the pre&s;&s;ure and action of the cir|cumjacent Parts. Their interior or proper Coat is only a Pro|duction of the outer Integument of the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, for which rea&s;on it adheres clo&s;ely to their Surface; tho not &s;o firmly, but it may be &s;eparated from it, without any con&s;iderable Lace|ration of their Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THEY are <HI>connected</HI> to different Parts, in order either to keep them in their ju&s;t Situation, or to communicate their proper Fluids to each other. The <HI>Tunica adipo&s;a</HI> &s;trongly affixes them
<PB N="3" REF="10">to the Loins, and prevents their falling down into the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> which wou'd occa&s;ion the &s;ides of the emulgent Ve&s;&s;els to collap&s;e at their Orifices next the great Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, and thereby take off any Communication between them and the Kidneys. As a farther Security, the Right is &s;ometimes connected to the Liver, &s;ometimes to the <HI>Inte&s;tinum caecum,</HI> and the left to the <HI>Colon</HI> and <HI>Spleen.</HI> They communicate with the <HI>Aorta</HI> and <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> by means of the <HI>Emulgents,</HI> and <HI>Arteria,</HI> and <HI>Vena adipo&s;a,</HI> and have a near Relation to the Bladder by means of the <HI>&V;reters.</HI></P>
<P>THEY have <HI>Nerves</HI> from the Interco&s;tals and &s;pinal Marrow, which together form the <HI>Plexus Renalis,</HI> though very few in number, and their Twigs very &s;mall; &s;eeming only de&s;ign'd to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the other Ve&s;&s;els that are immediately employ'd in the Secretion of Urine: but they are pretty plentifully &s;tock'd with <HI>Lymphaticks;</HI> &s;ome of which coming out of their <HI>con|cave</HI> Side, and making &s;everal Ana&s;tomo&s;es in various places, are at lengh in&s;erted into a Gland in human Bodies, and thence carry the Lymph to the <HI>Receptaculum Chyli;</HI> whil&s;t others ari&s;ing from their <HI>gibbo&s;e</HI> Side, form a double Trunk: one of which creeping upwards, the other downwards along their Back, and both making a Flexure towards the Emulgent Ve&s;&s;els, terminate likewi&s;e in a Gland, and thence proceed to the &s;ame Receptacle. The&s;e Lymphaticks &s;pring from &s;o minute an Ori|gin, that it e&s;capes the Eye, though a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t Micro|&s;cope, which has occa&s;ion'd variety of Conjectures concerning them: But <HI>Nuck</HI>'s Experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nuckii adenographia, cap. 6. p. 61.</NOTE>, from whom I have taken this Account, (not being able my &s;elf to trace their Beginning) have taught us, that they ari&s;e from the Capillary Branches of the Emulgent Arterties: for by blowing into this Artery, the <HI>Flatus</HI> ea&s;ily pa&s;s'd into the&s;e <HI>Ducts,</HI> and di&s;tended them. As this Experiment demonstrates the Communication between the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, it at the &s;ame time gives us an in&s;ight into the u&s;e of the <HI>Lymphaticks</HI> of the&s;e Parts; which is to receive and carry off the <HI>Lymph</HI> from the Blood brought for the Nouri&s;hment of the Kidney, as the Urinary Tubes receive the excrementitious Parts, or the Urine.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<P>WE come now to the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> who&s;e external Superficies in <HI>Adults</HI> is uniform and even, but in <HI>Infants</HI> rough and unequal, being divided as it were into di&s;tinct Lobes; which has made &s;everal imagine the <HI>Kidney</HI> to be compos'd of a Number of conglomerate Glands: but its <HI>inward Structure</HI> has occa&s;ion'd a great Variety of Opinions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Ari&s;totle, Galen, Ve&s;alius, Fallopius, Highmore, Ve&s;lingius, Bartholin.</NOTE> &s;uitable to the Philo&s;ophy in vogue at the Time the Authors wrote concerning them: To examine which is now altogether needle&s;s, becau&s;e the modern Improvements in Anatomy have demon&s;trated them to be &s;o many Fictions of learned Men. It will however be worth while to take notice, that the great <HI>Hippocrates</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. de glandulis.</NOTE> ob&s;erving the Matter contain'd in the Glands to be White, and re&s;embling Phlegm or <HI>Pituita,</HI> a&s;cribes a U&s;e to them of receiving any re|dundancy of Moi&s;ture in the Body, which by the peculiar &s;pon|gine&s;s of their Sub&s;tance they attract; and accordingly tells us, that the <HI>Kidneys</HI> abounding with much Humidity have <HI>Glands,</HI> and the&s;e larger than in any other Part. From this De&s;cription of the largene&s;s of the&s;e Glands, it is certain <HI>Hippocrates</HI> did not &s;ay this from ob&s;erving the inward Structure of the Kid|neys, but from reflecting on the Quantity of Urine proceeding from them; which, according to his Notion, mu&s;t have Glands proportionably large to attract and percolate it. But however, what he concluded from his penetrating Sagacity laid a good Foundation for farther Anatomical Inquiries into their Make; which it is a wonder were attended for &s;o many Ages after him with &s;o little Succe&s;s, excepting only by <HI>Aretaeus,</HI> who &s;ays the &s;ame thing<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. de Cau&s;is, &amp;c. Auctorum Morborum, cap. 3. Id. diutur|norum morb. cap. 4.</NOTE>. And indeed I mu&s;t &s;ay thus much for the honour of this <HI>great Father of Phy&s;ick,</HI> (tho it has been endeavour'd to make us believe the contrary) that even in this <HI>knowing Age</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Blackmore<HI>'s Preface to his E&s;&s;ay on the Small-Pox.</HI></NOTE> whoever will take the pains to read him, and has the proper Requi&s;ites to under&s;tand him, will find <HI>Gains worthy of his Labour,</HI> and <HI>upon many Accounts be|come the better Phy&s;ician for it.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<P>THE fir&s;t Author, who gives a De&s;cription of all the consti|tuent Parts of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> that comes near the Fact, is <HI>Bar|tholomaeus Eu&s;tachius,</HI> a Scholar and Cotemporary of <HI>Ve&s;alius.</HI> He ob&s;erves, that in &s;ome Animals, as Bulls, Bears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Kidneys</HI> have <HI>Glands,</HI> which appear very con&s;picuous, both in the exterior and interior part of them: but that in human Bodies the&s;e glandulous Sub&s;tances are found in the inmo&s;t part of the <HI>Kidney</HI> only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Renum &s;tructura, cap. 2.</NOTE>, and are plac'd in that particular part of it, where the Branches of the <HI>&V;reter</HI> terminate, covering the ex|tremity of each Branch; which Glands being divided length|ways, certain Furrows or little Channels may be perceiv'd, like &s;o many &s;mall Hairs, thro' which he does not doubt, but that the Urine percolates<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. cap. 7.</NOTE>. This Account has a very near Re&s;em|blance of their real Structure: but at the &s;ame time it proves, that he mi&s;took the <HI>Carunculae Papillares</HI> for Glands, as he did the Inter&s;tices between the Urinary Ducts for Channels to convey the <HI>&V;rine;</HI> for he does not admit of any Tubes for this purpo&s;e: but in oppo&s;ition to &s;ome, who imagin'd the&s;e &s;mall Filaments might be &s;o many minute Ve&s;&s;els, he gives it as <HI>his</HI> Opinion, that they are only Furrows elegantly engrav'd in the Sub&s;tance of the Kidney<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. cap. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE Mi&s;takes are rectify'd by <HI>Bellini,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer of the <HI>&V;rinary Ducts;</HI> (though very likely the former Author gave him the Hint) and has al&s;o &s;hewn from whence they &s;pring, and how they are propagated<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De &s;tructur&acirc; Ren. p. 19.</NOTE>. From what has been wrote by him, and from reiterated In&s;pections and Ex|periments &s;ince his Time, it appears, that the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Kidney</HI> is only a Congeries of Blood-Ve&s;&s;els and Excretory Ducts wrapt up in one common Covering:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tab.</HI> I.</NOTE> for the <HI>Emulgent Artery,</HI> which goes off from the Trunk of the <HI>Aorta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ig</HI> I.</NOTE> in its Progre&s;s toward the Kidney divides fir&s;t into two Branches, and the&s;e again into two, three, and &s;ometimes four more, which pierce the concave Side of it; when they immediately di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves between the Coats of the <HI>Pelvis.</HI> The&s;e at their <HI>exit</HI> from hence, &s;end off &s;maller Branches; which being incurvated, and meeting each other, form &s;everal <HI>Ana&s;tomo&s;es.</HI> From the&s;e,
<PB N="6" REF="13">towards the <HI>gibbo&s;e</HI> part of the <HI>Kidney,</HI> ari&s;e &s;till more minute Ramifications, which are propagated to the outer Superficies, and by their different Convolutions and Contortions there form a &s;ort of Net-work,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> II.</NOTE> not unlike a Ball of Silk; but before their ultimate Branches lo&s;e their form, and a&s;&s;ume that of <HI>Excretory Ducts,</HI> they change their circular Progre&s;s into a &s;erpentine one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ruy&s;ch. The&s;aur. 6. <HI>p.</HI> 13.</NOTE>. From the Extremities of the&s;e capillary arterial Branches ari&s;e the <HI>Veins,</HI> which being divided into the like Ramifications (tho differently modify'd) are inclos'd in one common <HI>Cap&s;ula</HI> with the Artery, and accompany it throughout the whole Kidney, going out where the Artery enters, and terminating in the <HI>Cava.</HI> In &s;ome Brutes of the Cat-kind this Vein is differently di&s;pos'd: for in&s;tead of accompanying the Artery within the Kidney, it propagates its Branches upon the <HI>Surface,</HI> as you may &s;ee in &s;ome very curious Preparations of Mr. <HI>Ranby</HI>'s here given.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> V.</NOTE></P>
<P>NEXT within the&s;e appears a Number of &s;mall Filaments, which look like <HI>fle&s;hy</HI> Fibres, but are really <HI>membranous</HI> and <HI>hollow,</HI> and agree with other excretory Ducts both in Sub|&s;tance and U&s;e. The&s;e were fir&s;t found out by <HI>Bellini,</HI> and are therefore call'd <HI>Tubuli Belliniani:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> III.</NOTE> They &s;eem &s;o &s;pring from the Sides of the Capillary Arteries, and extending them|&s;elves in a right Line towards the Centre or <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the Kidney, are collected at their Extremities into twelve Cla&s;&s;es, and form the <HI>Papillae,</HI> which are nothing el&s;e but the Endings of the&s;e Ducts &s;o collected together, and not <HI>Glands,</HI> as <HI>Eu|&s;tachius</HI> &s;uppos'd. The remaining part of the Kidney is po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd by a Dilatation of the <HI>&V;reter,</HI> which forms the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> and then &s;ends off twelve Branches call'd <HI>Fi&s;tulae Membranaceae,</HI> which join the <HI>Papillae,</HI> and have Fat inter&s;pers'd between each of them for the Lubrication of their Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;po&s;ition and Communication of the Ve&s;&s;els in the Kidneys ea&s;ily appears, by blowing into the Emulgent Artery, or injecting a colour'd Liquor into it, which will not only very much di&s;tend the whole, but will pa&s;s into the Emulgent Veins, the Tubes ju&s;t mention'd, and &s;ometimes the <HI>&V;reter</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="14">
<P>BUT be&s;ides this aggregate of Ve&s;&s;els, the accurate <HI>Malpighius</HI> has ob&s;erv'd a con&s;iderable Number of exceeding &s;mall Bodies, of a round Figure like the Eggs of Fi&s;h, which are annex'd to the ends of the Arteries, and plac'd between them and the <HI>Tubuli &V;rinarii;</HI> to the la&s;t of which they are likewi&s;e join'd by their proper Excretory Ducts, and corre&s;pond to them in Number; and which upon filling the Emulgent Artery with Ink, will al&s;o, he &s;ays, appear ting'd with it, and their Adhe&s;ion to the Capil|lary Branches thereby di&s;cover'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Renibus, cap. 3.</NOTE>. This has occa&s;ion'd Anato|mi&s;ts to differ about the Structure of this Part of the <HI>Kidney: Malpighius</HI> will have the&s;e Appearances to be di&s;tinct <HI>Glands,</HI> and the immediate In&s;truments of the Secretion of Urine.</P>
<P>THE curious Dr. <HI>Ruy&s;ch</HI> ab&s;olutely denies that there are any &s;uch Ve&s;icular Bodies in this Part, and confirms his Judgment by repeated Injections, which di&s;cover'd the immediate conti|nuity of the Arteries and Urinary Ducts without any inter|vening Sub&s;tance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;aur. 2. pag. 64, 65.</NOTE>: He acknowledges indeed to have ob&s;erv'd certain round diaphanous Bodies in the middle of the Kidney, but they were not in number &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Ends a&s;|&s;ign'd<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. pag. 65.</NOTE>; and even the&s;e vani&s;h'd upon Injection, and con&s;equent|ly could not be Glands<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;aur. 1. p. 35, 58.</NOTE>. The Que&s;tion between them then is not whether there are <HI>Glands</HI> in the Kidney, for they both al|low that; but concerning the intimate Structure of that par|ticular Part of them, which is the immediate <HI>&s;eparating Organ:</HI> The one being of opinion that the Blood is alter'd, or in other words, the Urine is &s;ecreted in the&s;e membranous Follicles, which afterwards empty them&s;elves thro' their own proper Excretory Ducts into tho&s;e of <HI>Bellini:</HI> The other, that there are none &s;uch; and if there were, yet that they are not di&s;tinct Glands, but that the Percolation is &s;imply made by the Orifi|ces of the <HI>Bellinian</HI> Ducts them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF it be lawful in <HI>this Place</HI> to enter into the nicer Parts of A|natomy, we may ob&s;erve, that Dr. <HI>Ruy&s;ch</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertions are very much confirm'd by &s;everal Preparations of this Part; in which
<PB N="8" REF="15">the &s;pherical Bodies that &s;eem'd to be &s;o many Glands before they were injected, appear after it to be only the Convolutions of the Capillary Branches of the Emulgent Artery, which the injected Liquor &s;ubtilly permeates, and pa&s;&s;es directly thence into the <HI>Tubuli &V;rinarii.</HI> This is more ea&s;ily &s;een in the Kidneys of Infants, which are the propere&s;t for this purpo&s;e, becau&s;e they are of a loo&s;er Contexture, and divided in a man|ner into Clu&s;ters of Glands; &s;o that if the&s;e membranous Folli|cles would appear at all, they would in &s;uch Subjects. Whe|ther, as &s;ome will have it, the Injection at the &s;ame time it fills the&s;e <HI>Ve&s;iculae,</HI> does not introduce &s;uch a Confu&s;ion, by en|larging their Dimen&s;ions, and making them pre&s;s again&s;t one another on all Sides, that the exceeding thin Membranes which compo&s;e them can't be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the injected Matter it &s;elf, is not &s;o ea&s;y ab&s;olutely to be determin'd; nor whether from the Di&s;ten&s;ion it makes in the Ve&s;&s;el it flows thro', it may not compre&s;s &s;uch others as lie contiguous and are not in|jected; at the &s;ame time it makes the one vi&s;ible, totally ob|literating the other: but it is not likely that it produces &s;uch Effects, becau&s;e in other Preparations of this &s;ort, we find that it di&s;covers the natural Contexture of the Part, which renders Dr. <HI>Ruy&s;ch</HI>'s Notion more certain and probable.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, admitting there are &s;uch membranous Blad|ders where <HI>Malpighius</HI> has plac'd them, which the Favourers of this A&s;&s;ertion &s;trenuou&s;ly contend for, from the regular Appear|ances in his different Experiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malpighii Epi&s;t. ad Spon. p. 25.</NOTE>, and from other Ob&s;erva|tions of their own, e&s;pecially upon morbid Kidneys, in which they have been found pretty large and turgid with Urine, when the Urinary Ducts have been ob&s;tructed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoires d' Academie des Sciences; Ann. 1705. p. 40.</NOTE>; yet that they are <HI>di&s;tinct Glands,</HI> and the proper <HI>&s;ecretory Organs</HI> of the <HI>&V;rine,</HI> is no way agreeable to Nature in other Parts of the like kind; becau&s;e where-ever we find the&s;e Follicles with their own pro|per inve&s;ting Membranes and Excretory Ducts, they don't per|form the Office of a Gland, but are only <HI>Appendages</HI> of it,

And by the way, in this con&s;i&s;ts one Difference in the Compo&s;ition of the Glands of the Body: that tho&s;e Glands which &s;ecrete a Liquor, that is afterwards to be di&s;charg'd from them at <HI>di&s;tant Intervals,</HI> as occa&s;ions require, are furni&s;h'd with the&s;e membranous Follicles, into which the &s;eparating Canal empties its Contents, which are re&s;erv'd there for that pur|po&s;e; &s;uch are the <HI>Mamillary Glands,</HI> tho&s;e of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts,</HI> and &s;everal other in different Parts of the Body: As on the contrary, tho&s;e Glands which &s;eparate a Fluid that is <HI>conti|nually</HI> to flow from them to &s;ome other Part, have no &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ion within their Sub&s;tance, neither do they want it; of which &s;ort are the <HI>Brain,</HI> the <HI>Te&s;ticles,</HI> &s;everal of the Conglomerate kind, and the <HI>Kidneys.</HI> This Di&s;tinction founded upon the &s;tricte&s;t Inquiries, may in &s;ome degree decide the Controver&s;y now depending between Anatomi&s;ts concerning the peculiar Make of the&s;e Bodies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rhaave</HI> de Fabric&acirc; Glandularum.</NOTE>; for both are in the right, when they confine their A&s;&s;ertions to <HI>particular</HI> Glands, as they both err, when they expend them to the whole <HI>Genus.</HI> But to return,</P>
<P>THE remaining part of the Kidneys, as before ob&s;erv'd, is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a Dilatation of the <HI>&V;reters,</HI> which make the <HI>Pelvis;</HI> the&s;e at their <HI>exit</HI> from hence contract their Dimen|&s;ions, and form each of them a &s;mall <HI>Tube,</HI> which runs with a tortuous inflexion to the Bladder.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> V.</NOTE> They are naturally of the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e-Quill; but are capable of being di&s;tended to a much greater Size, as is evident in &s;ome calculous Ca&s;es; of which &s;ort I have &s;een two remarkable In&s;tances, where their Orifices were &s;o enlarg'd, that upon injecting the Bladder, in order to perform the high Operation of Cutting for the Stone, the Water pa&s;s'd into the very <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the Kidney, &s;o that the Bladder was never di&s;tended, which appear'd to be the Ca&s;e upon Di&s;&s;ection.

<PB N="10" REF="17">they de&s;cend over the <HI>Iliack Arteries,</HI> according to the com|mon Opinion.

Hence <HI>Morgagni</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adver&s;ar. 2.

<P>THEY are compos'd of three <HI>Coats,</HI> which make them more than ordinary thick in proportion to the Space they enclo&s;e, and enable them the better to re&s;i&s;t the weight of the di&s;tend|ed Inte&s;tines, (and in Women the <HI>&V;terus</HI> likewi&s;e) which might otherwi&s;e &s;o compre&s;s them, as to hinder the Transflux of Urine. Anatomi&s;ts particularly de&s;cribe the Sub&s;tance of the&s;e Coats, and call the outer <HI>Membranous,</HI> the middle <HI>Mu&s;cular,</HI> and the innermo&s;t Nervous: but upon the nice&s;t In&s;pection, there is no &s;uch Di&s;tinction appears, but the whole &s;eems to be a thick nervous Membrane; in the in&s;ide of which are plac'd divers &s;mall Glands that emit a <HI>Mucus</HI> to guard them from the Salts of the Urine.</P>
<P>THEY are in&s;erted into the Bladder very obliquely, after ha|ving pa&s;s'd about a Finger's breadth between its Coats, and are remarkably contracted at the Place of their opening into it. They are furni&s;h'd with Arteries and Veins from the Trunks of the <HI>Aorta</HI> and <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> and have Nerves from the Inter|co&s;tals and &s;pinal Marrow; which la&s;t render them extremely &s;en&s;ible, and occa&s;ion that exce&s;&s;ive Pain upon any forcible Di&s;|tention.</P>
<P>IN the common Cour&s;e of Nature there is only <HI>one &V;reter</HI> to each Kidney; but &s;ometimes &s;he furni&s;hes both of them with <HI>two,</HI> when unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity requires &s;uch a Deviation from her general Rules. <HI>Double &V;reters</HI> have been often ob&s;erv'd,

<P>SUCH an extraordinary Provi&s;ion in this Subject was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary from the uncommon Structure of the Kidneys; in which the <HI>Fi&s;tulae Membranaceae</HI> do not di&s;charge them&s;elves into one common <HI>Pelvis,</HI> but into <HI>two</HI> di&s;tinct ones; which not communicating with each other, but being &s;eparated by the Sub|&s;tance of the Kidney, it was requi&s;ite that <HI>each</HI> &s;hould be fur|ni&s;h'd with its proper <HI>&V;reter,</HI> to carry off the Urine &s;ent into it.</P>
<P>WE come now to the grand Receptacle of the Urine, the <HI>Bladder.</HI> This is &s;ituate in the <HI>Pelvis</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> be|tween a Duplicature of the <HI>Peritonaeum;</HI> the outer <HI>Lamella</HI> covering its fore-part, the inner pa&s;&s;ing over its <HI>Fundus,</HI> and covering the hinder: It is compos'd of three Coats; the outer is a Covering of the <HI>Peritonaeum,</HI> the middle is Mu&s;cular, and made up partly of Longitudinal, and partly of Fibres vari|ou&s;ly inter&s;ecting each other. The inner is Nervous, in which are plac'd &s;everal Glands that &s;eparate an unctuous Matter to defend it from the Acrimony of the Urine. This Coat is ca|pable of very great Di&s;tention; but not having a Power of con|tracting its Dimen&s;ions as the two others have, it is therefore, when not di&s;tended, and the Bladder empty, corrugated in &s;e|veral places.</P>
<P>THE middle Coat is plac'd by Anatomi&s;ts among the Mu&s;cles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tab.</HI> III. <HI>Fig.</HI> I.</NOTE> and nam'd <HI>Detru&s;or &V;rinae</HI> from its Office; but it is not ea&s;y to apprehend how the Contraction of this Mu&s;cle &s;hould pro|duce &s;uch an Effect as it is commonly de&s;crib'd; &s;ince its Longi|tudinal Fibres having no fix'd Point whence they &s;pring, but terminating at each end in the lower Orifice of the Bladder, they would rather pull up the Neck of it when they contract
<PB N="12" REF="19">them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> I. II.</NOTE> than bring the <HI>Fundus</HI> downwards. Dr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> among his other curious Preparations of this Part, has one which gives us a <HI>different,</HI> but the <HI>true</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e Longitudi|nal Fibres; whence he found, that they ari&s;e from the inner and lower part of the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> and the fore part of the <HI>Pro&s;tata,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing from thence over the <HI>Fundus</HI> of the Bladder, come down the hinder part of it, and are in&s;erted into the back part of this Gland: and that the&s;e Fibres are rang'd in the manner that accurate Anatomi&s;t has de&s;crib'd, the two annex'd Prepa|rations plainly &s;hew, which have been made for that purpo&s;e &s;ince his communicating this his Di&s;covery to me; for which I take this Opportunity publickly to return him Thanks, as well as for &s;everal others, that are well worthy Ob&s;ervation, and when he thinks proper to oblige the Publick with them, will appear very much to his Honour. Analogous to the <HI>Pro&s;tata,</HI> in Women, is the <HI>Vagina &V;teri,</HI> in which the Fibres terminate. As this Mu&s;cle is &s;o di&s;pos'd, we ea&s;ily &s;ee that by its Contrac|tion the <HI>Fundus</HI> of the <HI>Bladder</HI> will be pull'd forwards and downwards towards the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> by the Longitudinal Fibres, at the &s;ame time that the Oblique ones le&s;&s;en its Dimen&s;ions, and &s;o both together will exclude the Urine.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Bladder</HI> has three Orifices; one External for the <HI>exit</HI> of the Urine, and two Internal for its <HI>Admi&s;&s;ion,</HI> where the <HI>&V;reters</HI> open into it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fig.</HI> III.</NOTE> From each of the&s;e latter <HI>Morgagni</HI> has ob&s;erv'd in both Sexes, that there proceeds a &s;mall but pretty thick and compact <HI>fle&s;hy Body,</HI> which pa&s;&s;ing from the <HI>&V;reters</HI> obliquely downwards on the back part of the Bladder, and being &s;omewhat Protuberant within its Neck joins its Fellow, and both together make an Angle at their Juncture; from whence in Males a Line is extended downwards as far as the <HI>Caput Gallinaginis.</HI> The&s;e Bodies he takes to be a <HI>Production</HI> of the <HI>&V;reters</HI> them&s;elves, and with very good rea&s;on; for by depre&s;&s;ing them with your Fingers, the Mouths of the <HI>&V;reters</HI> contract and are clos'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adver&s;ar. 1. <HI>Pag.</HI> 5.</NOTE>.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the U&s;es and Powers of the Urinary Organs.</HEAD>
<P>_WE come now to inquire into the U&s;es of the Or|gans de&s;crib'd, and into the Powers with which they re&s;pectively act upon the Fluids that pa&s;s through their Cavities. That the general U&s;e of them is to &s;eparate the Urine from the Blood, and to promote its Pa&s;&s;age afterwards out of the Body, appears <HI>prim&acirc; facie,</HI> upon di&s;&s;ecting the&s;e &s;everal Parts: but the Manner how this Separation is perform'd has been very little under&s;tood by all the antient Writers, as well as by many of the more mo|dern ones, which has occa&s;ion'd this Action to be attributed to different Cau&s;es. As, that the Urine was &s;ecreted from the Blood by means of <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Van Helmont.</NOTE>; that the aqueous <HI>Serum</HI> was <HI>precipi|tated</HI> from the <HI>Cruor</HI> by a peculiar <HI>Ferment</HI> re&s;iding in the Kid|neys<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sylvii Praxis Med. lib. 1. cap. 55.

Pharmaceut. Part. 1.

<P>IT will not however be ami&s;s, before we explain the Nature of this Secretion, to premi&s;e, that <HI>Bellini</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;or Boer|haave,</HI> though both of them reject the&s;e Hypothe&s;es, have not|with&s;tanding fallen into a Mi&s;take about this Affair; for the fir&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="25">imagines, that the Blood, when arriv'd at the Extremities of the Emulgent Arteries, is <HI>extrava&s;ated</HI> through their patent Orifices into a <HI>&s;mall Space</HI> that lays between them, and the Origination of the <HI>Tubuli &V;rinarii</HI> and Emulgent Veins; the former re|ceiving the urinous Parts, the latter the refluent Blood by means of the <HI>different Configuration</HI> of their Orifices: whereas it is not only evident to Sen&s;e, from <HI>injecting</HI> the Kidney, that the Urinary Ducts &s;pring <HI>immediately</HI> from the extreme Branches of of the Artery; but it is demon&s;trable likewi&s;e from the Nature of Fluids, that the Orifices of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els cannot be different in Figure; becau&s;e the Pre&s;&s;ure of all Liquors being con&s;tantly perpendicular to the Sides of the containing Ve&s;&s;els, the&s;e will hereby be every where di&s;tended equally, that is, they mu&s;t be Circular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bellini de Structur&acirc; Renum pag. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Blood indeed is previou&s;ly di&s;pos'd for a particular Secretion by the peculiar Attrition of its Parts, and the Pre&s;&s;ure it undergoes in the various Complications and Contor|tions of the <HI>Arteriolae</HI> of the Gland; whereby it is determin'd to part with &s;uch Particles as are adapted to the Orifices of of the &s;ecerning Canals, which will be imping'd upon them with a certain Velocity; and as the&s;e Complications and Contor|tions are va&s;tly different in different Glands, there will hence ari&s;e a Variety of Secretions in the&s;e Bodies: but that the Orifices of the Secretory Ducts mu&s;t be <HI>Circular,</HI> (though their Dimen&s;ions differ in different Glands) is evident from the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Effects of Fluids upon yielding Ve&s;&s;els, as they run through them. And by the way, the whole Doctrine of Secre|tion depends upon the <HI>particular Contexture</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the Arterial Branches of the Gland, the Velocity with which the Blood is imping'd upon the Orifices of the &s;eparating Canals, and the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Orifices them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE <HI>la&s;t Author</HI> has err'd, by concluding, that the Secretion of the Urine is perform'd two ways; the one more &s;imple, by the immediate Percolation of the Urinous Parts through the <HI>Bel|linian
<PB N="19" REF="26">Ducts;</HI> the other more complex'd, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>di&s;tinct Glands:</HI> whereas there are no &s;uch Bodies, in his Sen&s;e of that word, to be found in the Kidneys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boerhavei In&s;titut. N^o 353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Separation of this Liquor then from the Blood is per|form'd by a very &s;imple piece of Mechani&s;m, ari&s;ing only from the Structure of the Kidneys, and &s;ome Properties of the Blood circulating through them. For from the De&s;cription of the con|&s;tituent Parts of the&s;e Organs already given, it appears, that the Blood by the Force of the Heart is propell'd through the vari|ous Ramifications and Convolutions of the Emulgent Arteries, till it comes to the Orifices of the <HI>Bellinian Ducts,</HI> which are the &s;eparating Canals; but the&s;e not being capable from the &s;mall|ne&s;s of their Diameters, of admitting the whole heterogeneous Ma&s;s, but only &s;uch Parts of it as are proportionate to them, the&s;e only will be receiv'd, whil&s;t the gro&s;&s;er Compound will cir|culate through the more patent Originations of the <HI>Emulgent Veins,</HI> to be return'd by them into the <HI>Vena Cava.</HI> Now the <HI>aqueous</HI> part of the Blood con&s;i&s;ting of much the &s;malle&s;t Par|ticles of it, and the <HI>Salts</HI> of the Blood having a clo&s;e Union with the watery Part, as being di&s;&s;olv'd in it, the&s;e will fir&s;t pa&s;s through the Orifices of the Secretory Ve&s;&s;els, and the &s;e|cern'd Fluid will con&s;equently for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;t of the&s;e Principles; which that the Urine does, will pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>THE Urine thus &s;eparated, flows through the&s;e Ducts to the <HI>Papillae,</HI> and is di&s;charg'd by them into the <HI>Fi&s;tulae Mebranaceae,</HI> which convey it to the <HI>Pelvis.</HI> This Cavity, though different from what Nature practi&s;es in other glandulous Parts, the Ex|cretory Ducts of &s;uch generally terminating in one large common Duct without any Cavity interpos'd, yet is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary from the <HI>Figure</HI> of the Kidney; for this making a con&s;iderable Segment of a Circle, in which the Urinary Tubes are propagated in great numbers from the Circumference towards the Centre, if they had open'd there at once in a Duct of a <HI>&s;mall</HI> Diameter, their Orifices would have been brought &s;o clo&s;e to one another,
<PB N="20" REF="27">and with Directions &s;o oppo&s;ite, as nece&s;&s;arily to have hinder'd &s;everal of them from di&s;charging their Contents, or at be&s;t have render'd &s;uch Di&s;charge very irregular; which is prevented by this <HI>Ba&s;in,</HI> whereby their Orifices are remov'd farther from the Centre and one another, and the Di&s;charge render'd thereby equal and uniform.</P>
<P>FROM hence the Urine de&s;cends through the <HI>&V;reters</HI> into the <HI>Bladder;</HI> but whether by its own Gravity, or whether it is forwarded in its Cour&s;e by the Action of the&s;e Tubes, has not yet been determin'd. Some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verheyen Anatom. Tractat. 2. cap. 18. Dionis Anatom. Demon&s;trat. 3.</NOTE> Anatomi&s;ts of great Note have in|ferr'd, from the &s;ub&s;tance and di&s;po&s;ition of their inve&s;ting Coats, that they are not merely pa&s;&s;ive, and barely afford a Pa&s;&s;age to the Urine, but that they are endu'd with a &s;ort of <HI>Pe|ri&s;taltick</HI> Motion, which promotes its De&s;cent into the Bladder. In Brutes indeed this Action of the <HI>&V;reters</HI> &s;eems &s;omewhat needful, by rea&s;on of the Horizontal Situation of their Bodies, the Urine not flowing downwards as in Men, and con&s;equently its Weight contributing little or nothing to its Motion; but in Men there is no &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity for this Action, becau&s;e the Urine will de&s;cend of cour&s;e from the erect Po&s;ition of the&s;e Tubes. On the other hand, I am apt to think, that the Cour&s;e of the Urine in us rather requires a Check than a Spur, in or|der to prevent its coming too violently into the Bladder, which would create an unea&s;y Sen&s;ation; and that for this rea&s;on Na|ture has made the <HI>&V;reters</HI> of <HI>unequal</HI> Dimen&s;ions in different parts of them, and has remarkably <HI>contracted</HI> their Orifices at their opening into the Bladder, that they might be &s;o many Im|pediments to any &s;udden Influx. But be&s;ides this Con&s;ideration, it is &s;till more probable that they want this Power, becau&s;e the&s;e Tubes, contrary to all other Parts that have mu&s;cular Fibres, when once they are forcibly di&s;tended, never re&s;ume their former Dimen&s;ions, as is ob&s;erv'd in hard Drinkers, and in Nephritick Ca&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ruy&s;ch. The&s;aur. N^o 8. p. 13.</NOTE>, which they would do if they enjoy'd a peri&s;taltick Mo|tion. But to proceed,</P>
<PB N="21" REF="28">
<P>THE Urine is receiv'd from the <HI>&V;reters</HI> by the <HI>Bladder,</HI> and is prevented from regurgitating into them by the Contrac|tion of their Orifices, and the Obliquity of their In&s;ertion. Here it remains, till by its Quantity and Acrimony it di&s;tends and &s;timulates its inmo&s;t Coat, which cau&s;es the mu&s;cular Coat to contract its Fibres, and act &s;trongly upon it; the two <HI>Corpora Carno&s;a</HI> of <HI>Morgagni</HI> &s;hortening their Fibres at the &s;ame time, and &s;o &s;traitening the Orifices of the <HI>&V;reters</HI> that none &s;hould e&s;cape that way. By this Pre&s;&s;ure, and that of the <HI>Abdominal Mu&s;cles,</HI> the Urine is protruded downwards with a Force &s;uffi|cient to overcome the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder, and to carry it through the <HI>&V;rethra</HI> &s;ome di&s;tance from the Body. But le&s;t any part of it &s;hould &s;tay in this <HI>Tube,</HI> when the Pre&s;&s;ure cea&s;es and the <HI>Sphincter</HI> is clos'd, the <HI>Accelerator Mu&s;cle</HI> begins to act, which expels any Remains that lodge therein.</P>
<P>THE Force with which the Bladder acts in projecting the Urine has been attempted to be fix'd by two &s;peculative Mathema|ticians: but their Calculations are widely different; the <HI>one</HI> making it amount to an <HI>uncommon Weight,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>other</HI> re|duces it to a <HI>Trifle.</HI></P>
<P>THE late ingenious Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> has computed it, exclu&s;ive of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Keil's E&s;&s;ays, pag. 91.</NOTE><HI>Abdominal Mu&s;cles,</HI> to be equal to no more than <HI>three Ounces;</HI> which &s;eems too incon&s;iderable to overcome the Con|tranitency of the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> and at the &s;ame time project the Urine &s;ix Foot from the Body in a Horizontal Direction; for the <HI>Abdominal Mu&s;cles</HI> contribute very little, except when we hold our Breath and &s;train, and then indeed they force &s;trongly downwards and pre&s;s upon the Bladder. But this Calculation is very defective: for not to mention what <HI>Michelotti</HI> has ob&s;erv'd, that Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> has not at all taken notice of the <HI>Vis Compre&s;&s;ionis</HI> in|nate to all Parts of the Bladder's <HI>internal Superficies,</HI> but only to that part of it which an&s;wers to a <HI>tran&s;ver&s;e Section of the
<PB N="22" REF="29">&V;rethra,</HI> it is farther deficient, in that he has omitted to con|&s;ider the <HI>Length</HI> of the <HI>&V;rethra</HI> from the Orifice of the Blad|der, and the <HI>Friction</HI> ari&s;ing therefrom, which he ought to have done to make it more perfect; for though the Force that cau&s;es a Fluid to run out at an <HI>Orifice</HI> with a certain Velocity, is as he has laid down; yet if there is a <HI>Tube</HI> expended <HI>any di&s;tance from it,</HI> through which the Fluid mu&s;t pa&s;s afterwards, the Velocity of it at its coming out at the <HI>end</HI> of this <HI>Tube</HI> will be, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> as its <HI>Length;</HI> and a greater Force will be re|quir'd, for example, to move a Fluid with a given Velocity through a <HI>Tube</HI> of <HI>twelve</HI> Inches long, than through one of <HI>four</HI> and of the &s;ame Diameter. This will rai&s;e the <HI>Power</HI> of the Bladder &s;omewhat higher; but will &s;carcely yet be &s;ufficient to throw the Urine &s;o far from the Body.</P>
<P><HI>MICHELOTTI</HI> on the other hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Separatione Fluidorum, pag. 117. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>, from <HI>mechanical</HI> Deductions rai&s;es the Power of the Bladder to 504 lb. Weight, but then the <HI>Principle</HI> he &s;ets out upon is <HI>fal&s;e;</HI> for he lays down, that the <HI>Force</HI> by which a Fluid running out at the Ori|fice of any Canal acquires a certain Velocity, is equal to the Weight of a Cylinder of the &s;ame Fluid, who&s;e Ba&s;is corre&s;|ponds to the Orifice it flows through, and who&s;e Altitude is equal to the <HI>&s;imple</HI> Altitude of the extreme Superficies of the Fluid above it; whereas it has been <HI>demon&s;trated</HI> by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;ophiae Principia, Lib. 2. Prop. 36. Corollar. 2.</NOTE>, that <HI>this Force</HI> mu&s;t amount to that of a Cylinder of the &s;ame Ba&s;is, but of <HI>double</HI> the Height, from whence any heavy Body mu&s;t fall to gain &s;uch a Velocity. However, what deduces from the <HI>Principle</HI> he lays down is ju&s;t; and if he had proceeded in the &s;ame manner upon Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s, as he has upon <HI>his own,</HI> he would have come as near as po&s;&s;ible to the entire Force of this Organ. The <HI>whole Propo&s;ition,</HI> with what he draws from it, is much too long to be tran&s;crib'd into a Di&s;cour&s;e of this kind: I &s;hall therefore refer you to the <HI>Work</HI> it &s;elf; and only ob&s;erve, that from hence may be &s;een
<PB N="23" REF="30">the Uncertainty even of <HI>mechanical Rea&s;oning,</HI> when apply'd to explain <HI>&s;ome Powers</HI> in the Animal OEconomy; though it is the <HI>be&s;t</HI> we can make u&s;e of in this part of Learning.</P>
<P>FROM this cur&s;ory View of the Actions of the re&s;pective Parts, and of the Nature of the Urinous Secretion, may be drawn &s;ome <HI>Conclu&s;ions,</HI> which will &s;erve as &s;o many An&s;wers to &s;everal Queries that commonly occur among the Writers of <HI>In&s;titutions:</HI> For from hence we learn, that the Urine is not an Excrement of any <HI>particular</HI> Concoction, as the Antients term it, but that all the Dige&s;tions &s;upply Matter for it; becau&s;e whatever is brought to the Kidneys has undergone the Action of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> has been broken and divided in its Pa&s;&s;age through the <HI>Lungs</HI> by the Force of Re&s;piration, and from thence flows blended with the <HI>nutritious</HI> part of the Blood, till it is &s;e|parated from it by the Orifices of the Urinary Tubes; and con|&s;equently is an Excrement of <HI>all</HI> the Concoctions.</P>
<P>HENCE likewi&s;e we can account why we urine &s;o <HI>frequent|ly</HI> when we drink plentifully; and particularly why this Excre|ment is &s;ecern'd in &s;o <HI>&s;hort</HI> a time, and in &s;uch <HI>large</HI> Quantities, after taking Diuretick Liquors upon an empty Stomach, without having recour&s;e to any <HI>occult</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages from this Organ to the Bladder, which Anatomy has never &s;hewn, and which repeated Ob&s;ervations have prov'd to have no Exi&s;tence. For notwith|&s;tanding an Experiment printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> &s;omewhat favours this Notion, a pretty Quantity of Urine be|ing found in a Dog's Bladder, though the <HI>&V;reters</HI> were ty'd, and were al&s;o a little &s;well'd above the <HI>Ligature,</HI> yet on the other hand, upon opening the Bladders of Per&s;ons dead of a Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Urine from an Ob&s;truction of the common Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and <HI>&V;reters,</HI> there never was found a Drop of Urine in them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act.</HI> N^o. 65, 67.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEITHER indeed is there any occa&s;ion for a &s;horter Convey|ance than what Nature has made <HI>apparent;</HI> for as to the frequent
<PB N="24" REF="31">Emi&s;&s;ions during the time of Drinking, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that before this happens, the <HI>Stomach,</HI> the <HI>&s;maller Inte&s;tines,</HI> and the <HI>Lacteal Veins</HI> are replete with the Potables, &s;o that the Blood receives a fre&s;h &s;upply of a Fluid from the next Draught that is taken down, which, if I may &s;o call it, protrudes what is al|ready contain'd in the Ve&s;&s;els above-mention'd into the <HI>Subcla|vian Vein:</HI> The Con&s;equence of which will be, that a greater Quantity of Blood will be brought to the Kidneys than u&s;ual, and therefore more Urine &s;eparated; and &s;o much the more, the more frequent the Draughts are repeated. And this is the rea&s;on why the fir&s;t Urine that is voided is of a higher Colour, and bears the Tokens of Concoction; whereas the &s;ub&s;equent Emi&s;|&s;ions lo&s;e the&s;e Signs, and the Urine at length flows perfectly limpid and crude, which it will continue to do till this extraor|dinary Supply has quite pa&s;s'd off, and then it will rea&s;&s;ume its former Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the other Ca&s;e, where the Stomach is empty, and the Blood is &s;uppos'd to be diverted of the Urinous Matter in great mea&s;ure, if we attend to the time which Fluids take up in pa&s;&s;ing from the Stomach into the Blood, and how &s;oon afterwards they are carry'd to the Kidneys by the Rapidity of its Cir|culation, we &s;hall find the common Pa&s;&s;ages altogether &s;uf|ficient.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd then, that though <HI>&s;olid</HI> Sub&s;tances re|quire a good deal of time to be comminuted by the Stomach, in order to have their Parts render'd &s;mall enough to enter the Lac|teals, yet <HI>Fluids</HI> when taken alone, from the minutene&s;s of their Particles are naturally fit to pa&s;s through them, and from their Aptitude to Motion will yield to the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion; for which rea&s;on they will make no &s;tay there, but very &s;oon be protruded by the Action of the Stomach and Guts into <HI>the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els:</HI> and that the Progre&s;s of Fluids through <HI>them</HI> takes up but a very &s;hort time, is demon&s;trated from the almo&s;t in&s;tanta|neous Depletion of the <HI>Lacteals</HI> in living Animals, that have
<PB N="25" REF="32">been open'd for this purpo&s;e &s;ome time after a full Meal, when the <HI>Chyle</HI> has been flowing through them; &s;o that if that part of the Liquids which comes away by Urine is not longer in flowing through the <HI>Heart</HI> to the <HI>Orifices</HI> of the Urinary Ducts of the Kidneys, than the &s;ame is in pa&s;&s;ing from the <HI>Stomach</HI> to the <HI>Heart,</HI> the <HI>common</HI> Channels will be found every way to an&s;wer the&s;e Emergencies.</P>
<P>NOW, as the <HI>Heart</HI> throws out every <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI> one <HI>Ounce</HI> of Blood, and beats <HI>&s;ixty Sy&s;toles</HI> in a Minute, there will pa&s;s into the <HI>Aorta</HI> 900 Ounces in a Quarter of an Hour: taking therefore the Dimen&s;ions of the <HI>emulgent Arteries,</HI> which &s;pring immediately from its Trunk, to be <HI>one Tenth</HI> of that of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> (which is very near the matter,) the Quantity of <HI>Blood</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>them</HI> in that time will be <HI>ninety Ounces,</HI> or <HI>&s;even Pounds &s;ix Ounces Troy.</HI> Add to this, that the <HI>Serum</HI> makes up the greater part of the Blood, and at this time is in a much larger Proportion, from the Addition of the inge&s;ted Li|quor, and we may conclude rea&s;onably, that two or three <HI>Pints</HI> of Urine may be &s;ecreted from &s;uch a Quantity of Blood in that time, and great part of it much &s;ooner: which will an&s;wer every thing that has been ob&s;erv'd, as to the quick Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Diu|reticks;</HI> the Effects of which upon this Secretion, either as to its Quantity or Quality, being at the &s;oone&s;t more than half this time.</P>
<P>THIS Notion of an immediate Pa&s;&s;age from the Stomach to the Bladder, &s;o contrary to Anatomy and the Nature of the Animal OEconomy, one would imagine &s;hould have been explo|ded at the fir&s;t Di&s;&s;ection of an Human Body; much more now, when the&s;e Parts are &s;o accurately known: but it &s;eems it is a|gain reviv'd and &s;trenuou&s;ly argu'd for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morgan's Principles of Phy&s;ick, Lond. 1725.</NOTE>, which is the rea&s;on for in&s;erting the foregoing Paragraphs. But to proceed,</P>
<PB N="26" REF="33">
<P>AS a <HI>Corollary</HI> to the foregoing it may be laid down, that the Quantity of Urine ought to be proportionate to the Quan|tity we drink. For <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the Quantity of the &s;e|cern'd Fluid is in proportion to the Quantity of Blood brought to the Orifice of the &s;eparating Canal; but the Quantity of the <HI>aqueous</HI> part of the Blood, of which the Urine chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts, is in proportion to the inge&s;ted Liquors; therefore the Quantity of Urine will be in proportion to them likewi&s;e. But here &s;ome Allowance mu&s;t be made for what pa&s;&s;es off by <HI>Per|&s;piration</HI> and <HI>Sweat,</HI> in <HI>Ex&s;piration,</HI> and with the <HI>Saliva;</HI> as like|wi&s;e for different Circum&s;tances. For Example, from Heat or Exerci&s;e, the <HI>aqueous</HI> Parts of the Blood pa&s;&s;ing through the Pores of the Skin in Sweat, the Quantity of Urine will be le&s;s; as on the contrary, the Pores of the Skin being &s;top'd by Cold, a larger Portion than u&s;ual will be voided.</P>
<P>AS the la&s;t Inference from the foregoing Theory, it appears, that <HI>other Particles</HI> be&s;ides what naturally compo&s;e the Urine, though of <HI>unequal</HI> Surfaces, one of which too may be longer than the Diameter of the Secretory Canal, may neverthele&s;s be &s;eparated together with it, provided the Surface that pre&s;ents it &s;elf to the Orifice does not exceed its Diameter. And that <HI>Blood</HI> it &s;elf may pa&s;s through, if it is imping'd with a Force &s;ufficient to di&s;tend and enlarge the Secretory Ducts; analogous to what happens to &s;ome other Ve&s;&s;els that are naturally &s;maller, but ampliated for a time, as in critical and &s;ymptomatical <HI>Hae|morrhages,</HI> and in the <HI>Men&s;trua.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrine laid down is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon the <HI>mechanical</HI> Properties of the Parts concern'd, that it is &s;carce liable to any Objection. The main one which &s;eems to affect it is this: That &s;eeing all the Parts that con&s;titute the Urine are in the Blood when it is brought to the Orifices of the Urinary Ducts, if the Percolation of the&s;e from the re&s;t only depended on <HI>their Diameters,</HI> they would all be &s;ecern'd at the &s;ame time, being of the &s;ame Nature and adapted to them, which is con|trary to <HI>Fact;</HI> the refluent Blood found in the Emulgent Veins
<PB N="27" REF="34">being &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;ome of the Principles of the Urine. But if we con&s;ider that part of the Blood is &s;pent upon the <HI>Nouri&s;h|ment</HI> of the Kidneys, and does not come to the&s;e Orifices, but is immediately receiv'd by the Venal Branches that corre&s;pond to them, we &s;hall find the rea&s;on why it &s;till retains the&s;e Prin|ciples in &s;ome degree, (which by the way may be &s;eparated from it in &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent Circulation through the&s;e Organs) and at the &s;ame time &s;ee this Objection obviated.</P>
<P>WE come now to con&s;ider the Nature and Properties of the Urine <HI>it &s;elf;</HI> this con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>fluid</HI> Sub&s;tance, in which are &s;u&s;tain'd &s;everal den&s;e and <HI>&s;olid</HI> Particles. The elementary or more &s;imple Parts of it are <HI>Water, Salt,</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> which are manife&s;ted to the Sen&s;es in the Experiments of <HI>Bellini</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bellini de Urinis, <HI>pag.</HI> 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT &s;imple Water is the <HI>fluid</HI> Part of the Urine, almo&s;t wholly, is known from a gentle Evaporation of it; by which means what is exhal'd is found to be limpid and in&s;ipid as the pure&s;t Water, and the in&s;pi&s;&s;ated <HI>Re&s;iduum</HI> after the Evaporation is over, is in all re&s;pects re&s;tor'd to the &s;tate of true Urine again; that is, in Colour, Ta&s;te, Smell and Con&s;i&s;tence, by pouring the &s;ame Quantity of common Water upon it, in&s;tead of the Fluid that was evaporated.</P>
<P>THE Exi&s;tence of a Salt is prov'd by the Ta&s;te, which becomes more pungent, the more the <HI>aqueous Men&s;truum</HI> is ex|hal'd, till at length there is left a black vi&s;cid Sub&s;tance that liquifies in the Air like common Salt, and is &s;o poignant as &s;carce to be borne by the Tongue. The Nature of this e&s;&s;ential Salt has not been con&s;ider'd by this Author; but by Experi|ments we find, that it is not a pure <HI>Alkali</HI> as &s;ome Chymi&s;ts have imagin'd, neither is it an Acid, but is <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> and partakes of both Qualities. For if you pour Spirit of <HI>Nitre, Aquafor|tis,</HI> or the like <HI>Acid</HI> upon the Urine, they will only produce a &s;omewhat <HI>higher</HI> Colour in it; which <HI>acid</HI> Spirits, when mix'd
<PB N="28" REF="35">with either a fix'd or volatile <HI>Alkali,</HI> always occa&s;ion a <HI>con&s;i|derable Ebullition.</HI> So if you put a <HI>nitrous</HI> Salt into the Spi|rit of Urine, it will turn it <HI>milky;</HI> and the like will happen if you do the &s;ame <HI>Salt of Tartar;</HI> which Experiments plainly prove this Salt to have both <HI>Acid</HI> and <HI>Alkali</HI> in its Compo&s;ition. But to proceed,</P>
<P>THE Particles of <HI>Earth</HI> in the Urine are perceiv'd by the following one: If you evaporate the Urine till it comes to the Con&s;i&s;tence of Honey, and pour upon it the &s;ame Quantity of common Water, the Artificial Urine will have this in common with the Natural; that it will grow turbid and putrify, and be|fore its Putrifaction, will let fall a perfectly in&s;ipid, &s;ubpallid and impalpable Powder every way agreeing with Elementary Earth.</P>
<P>THAT there is a <HI>Sulphur</HI> al&s;o in the Urine, though over|look'd by <HI>Bellini,</HI> is evident from the &s;trong Smell it has when only voided; but chiefly from that Foetidne&s;s ari&s;ing from it, when it is in a State of Putrifaction, or during Evaporation; though there is indeed but a &s;mall Quantity of this Principle, becau&s;e there is &s;carce any of it comes off in Di&s;tillation.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e three Principles of Water, Salt, and Earth, and the different Proportions they bear to each other, depend in great mea&s;ure the <HI>Colour, Saltne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Cou&s;i&s;tence</HI> of the Urine, with all the Varieties ob&s;ervable in each. If the aqueous Parts more than ordinary exceed the other, the Urine will be limpid or pale: If the Salts abound too plentifully, it will be of a &s;hining flammeous Colour, but &s;till clear; the Salts being pellu|cid Bodies. If the Earth prevails, being an Opake Body, it will ob&s;truct the Pa&s;&s;age of the Rays of Light, and produce a more inten&s;e Colour, taking off from the Clearne&s;s and Pellucidne&s;s of the Urine, and the more &s;o as its Quantity encrea&s;es in an Over-proportion, till at length the Urine will be turbid and thick.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="36">
<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e three, it is rea&s;onable to think, that the natural Colour of the Urine is owing in great mea&s;ure to the <HI>Sulphur</HI> contain'd in it. For though its Quantity is but &s;mall, yet it &s;till retains its Colour after it is &s;eparated from the other Principles, and will give a con&s;iderable Tincture to Water, when mix'd with it, which the other Principles of Salt and Earth will not do after their Separation, and yet <HI>they</HI> are allow'd on all hands to contribute chiefly to its Colour.</P>
<P>THE different Degrees of <HI>Saltne&s;s</HI> in the Urine ari&s;e from the different Quantities of Salt floating in the aqueous <HI>Men|&s;truum;</HI> who&s;e Pungency upon the Tongue will be greater, the le&s;s Fluid there is to di&s;&s;olve them and obtund their <HI>Spiculae,</HI> and &s;o <HI>vice vers&acirc;.</HI> And that the Urine will be of a <HI>gro&s;&s;er</HI> or <HI>thinner</HI> Con&s;i&s;tence, as the &s;olid Particles are in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree, is &s;o evident, that it wants no Explanation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Contents</HI> ob&s;ervable in the Urine, which bear the Names of <HI>Nubeculae, Su&s;pen&s;iones</HI> and <HI>Sedimenta,</HI> are nothing el&s;e but the&s;e &s;olid Particles; which when this compound Fluid is out of the Body and at <HI>re&s;t,</HI> &s;eparate from the aqueous Part, and take place according to their &s;pecifick Gravities; ha|ving the&s;e Appellations given them as they are found in the upper, middle, or lowe&s;t part of the Urine: but &s;o neverthe|le&s;s, that the different Den&s;ity of the&s;e <HI>Contents</HI> at one time more than another, and the different Re&s;i&s;tance of the Medium in which they are &s;u&s;pended, may afterwards alter their Situa|tion; in&s;omuch that what was at fir&s;t a <HI>Su&s;pen&s;ion,</HI> may at length &s;ub&s;ide and become a <HI>Sediment.</HI></P>
<P>THE Nature of the Urine being thus known, we may draw &s;everal Inferences from it that will explain &s;ome Affections com|mon to the Animal OEconomy. Hence fir&s;t the Rea&s;on ap|pears, why upon u&s;ing Exerci&s;e, and in hot Weather, the Urine is of a higher Colour, and more &s;alt and &s;timulating than at other times: and why the like Urine is made, after having ab|&s;tain'd
<PB N="30" REF="37">&s;ome time from taking any Liquid. For in both ca&s;es the &s;olid Contents will be in a greater proportion than the aque|ous <HI>Men&s;truum;</HI> this la&s;t being carry'd off through the Pores of the Skin in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, as in the &s;econd a fre&s;h Supply of it being for &s;ome time taken off from the Blood, what is &s;ecreted by the Kidneys in &s;uch Circum&s;tances will be more than ordinarily &s;aturated with the&s;e &s;olid Principles.</P>
<P>THE foregoing Ob&s;ervation &s;hews the Cau&s;e, which makes the Urine of healthy People and of a &s;trong Habit of Body, to have &s;eldom the <HI>Nubeculae</HI> and <HI>Su&s;pen&s;iones</HI> found in it, but the Sediment more frequently; becau&s;e the two fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of the more fine and &s;ubtile Parts of the &s;olid Contents, pa&s;s off toge|ther with the aqueous by Sweat and Per&s;piration, which the more gro&s;s and heavy Particles that form the Sediment can't do, by rea&s;on of their Bulk and Figure, and therefore will be &s;ecreted by the Kidneys, and &s;ub&s;ide by their own Gravity. The &s;ame &s;hews the near Relation between the <HI>&V;rine</HI> and <HI>Sweat;</HI> and that the Increa&s;e of the la&s;t may &s;upply the Defect of the Urinous Se|cretion in &s;ome mea&s;ure; which is the rea&s;on that Patients linger &s;o long under a total Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine from a Stoppage in the Kidneys, before this Ailment kills them; which &s;ome times in &s;trong Bodies is <HI>eighteen</HI> or <HI>twenty days:</HI> and there are &s;e|veral In&s;tances where the Urine has been totally &s;uppre&s;s'd from the &s;ame Cau&s;e for <HI>fifteen</HI> and <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> Days together, and yet the Patients <HI>recover'd</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stalpart. Ob&s;ervat. Centur. 1. Ob&s;ervat. 51</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO determine the exact <HI>Colour</HI> and <HI>Con&s;i&s;tence</HI> the Urine ought to have in healthy Per&s;ons is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the great Latitude that mu&s;t be allow'd for the difference of <HI>Age, Con&s;titution,</HI> and <HI>Diet</HI> of different Per&s;ons, and of the&s;e in the &s;ame at different times. But &s;eeing the two Extremes of a limpid Urine, and of a red and turbid one, are produc'd as either the watery <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> or the &s;olid Contents abound beyond mea&s;ure, we may venture to conclude thus far, that from a due portion and mixture of the&s;e in a &s;tate of perfect health,
<PB N="31" REF="38">there &s;hould ari&s;e a <HI>Medium</HI> between the&s;e Extremes, which is a light <HI>yellow,</HI> or <HI>Citrine</HI> Colour. As to its <HI>Con&s;i&s;tence,</HI> re|gard being had to the foregoing Circum&s;tances, it &s;hould be pret|ty near that of common Water, but &s;omewhat more thick and heavy, by rea&s;on of the &s;olid Principles contain'd in it.</P>
<P>WHY the natural <HI>Sediment</HI> &s;hould be white, light and equal, is more ea&s;ily accounted for. For &s;eeing the Fluids &s;ecreted from the Blood, will be as the &s;tate of the Blood at the time of their Secretion; and the Blood in a natural State is &s;uppos'd always to be alike and equal to it &s;elf, what&s;oever Parts of it are &s;eparated by the Kidneys in equal times, will al&s;o be alike and equal; and con&s;equently when out of the Body and at re&s;t, will mutually take place by one another, and render the <HI>Sediment</HI> equal. The <HI>Whitene&s;s</HI> of it is owing to the large Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> contain'd in it (as is manife&s;t from the <HI>Bellinian</HI> Experi|ment)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Urinis, <HI>pag.</HI> 13.</NOTE> which being united with the thick vi&s;cid Parts of the Urine, will &s;ub&s;ide along with them, and by the <HI>Rules of Op|ticks</HI> produce &s;uch a Colour.</P>
<P>Hence in the la&s;t place we may know, how far the In&s;pection of the Urine is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in the practice of Phy&s;ick: for by com|paring the &s;everal Appearances in the Urine of <HI>di&s;ea&s;ed</HI> Per&s;ons, with tho&s;e that <HI>naturally</HI> ari&s;e in it, and ob&s;erving in what re|&s;pects they differ from each other, we &s;hall be inform'd in great mea&s;ure of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Blood, as to the mixture of its Parts, and the Proportion between them. And if we take notice at the &s;ame time of all the Symptoms that <HI>accompany</HI> &s;uch Appearances, and <HI>follow</HI> upon them, we &s;hall di&s;cover what the Di&s;temper is that proceeds from &s;uch a <HI>Cra&s;is</HI> of Blood, and al&s;o progno&s;ticate the Event of it.</P>
<P>IT were ea&s;y to &s;hew from Authors and private Ob&s;ervation what State of Blood each Alteration of the Urine di&s;covers: but being confin'd to treat only of the Di&s;tempers belonging to &s;ome particular Organs, it will be impertinent to take notice of
<PB N="32" REF="39">any other, than what will lead us to the Knowledge of the&s;e; which will be &s;een in the remaining part of this Lecture.</P>
<P>WE have now gone through the <HI>&V;&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Parts,</HI> and enquir'd into the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>&V;rine;</HI> in which la&s;t I have for the mo&s;t part follow'd <HI>Bellini</HI> in the mo&s;t conci&s;e manner po&s;&s;ible, as his Account of it is the be&s;t, both by his <HI>Experi|ments,</HI> and the <HI>Conclu&s;ions</HI> he draws from them.

<HEAD> PART I. Of a <HI>STONE</HI> in the <HI>KIDNEYS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Organs of &V;rine</HI> are incident to &s;everal Indi&s;|po&s;itions, in common with other Parts of the like Structure and Compo&s;ition, and which &s;pring al&s;o from the &s;ame general Cau&s;es; As <HI>Inflammations, Tumours, Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, &V;lcers, Schirri, &amp;c.</HI> but the mo&s;t frequent, and indeed chief Di&s;tempers that afflict them proceed from the Urine &s;eparated by them, or pa&s;&s;ing through them. The&s;e are attend|ed with very untoward Symptoms, and if of long Continuance, very fatal Con&s;equences: none of which are more common than tho&s;e ari&s;ing from a <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Kidneys</HI> or <HI>Bladder;</HI> which &s;hall therefore be the Subject of the remaining part of this <HI>Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>IF we compare what has been &s;aid in the foregoing part of it, concerning the Elementary Principles of the Urine, with &s;everal Experiments made upon the&s;e concreted Sub&s;tances, it will appear, that the material Cau&s;e of a <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Kidney</HI> is originally in the natural Compo&s;ition of this Fluid: For we find from Chymi&s;try and micro&s;copical Ob&s;ervations, that what we call a <HI>Stone</HI> almo&s;t entirely con&s;i&s;ts of a volatile and fix'd <HI>Salt,</HI> &s;uch as the Urine plentifully abounds with. In order therefore to form a calculous Concretion, there is no <HI>Petrefac|tion</HI> requir'd, as the Naturali&s;ts term it, nor any change of Sub|&s;tance in the con&s;tituent Parts of the Urine, but only a Separa|tion of the &s;aline and &s;ome earthy Particles of it from the Fluid, and &s;uch an intimate Cohe&s;ion of the&s;e &s;olid Corpu&s;cles there|upon, as not to be di&s;united or di&s;&s;olv'd again by any &s;ub&s;equent Afflux of Urine upon them.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="41">
<P>BOTH the&s;e Accidents will happen, if either the <HI>Salts</HI> are in &s;uch <HI>great abundance</HI> in the Urine, that they cannot pa&s;s through the <HI>exceeding &s;mall Ducts</HI> that form the <HI>Papillae;</HI> or if they are hinder'd from moving through them by any <HI>vi&s;cid Matter</HI> that is &s;eparated along with them, and &s;o unites them to|gether; or if the&s;e <HI>Ducts</HI> them&s;elves are &s;o much <HI>compre&s;s'd</HI> or <HI>contracted,</HI> as not to admit the Salts through their Cavities. For in all the&s;e Circum&s;tances the &s;aline <HI>Lympha</HI> will &s;tagnate at the <HI>Papillae,</HI> whereby the Salts will be brought too near one another; which being Corpu&s;cles of very great attractive Powers, they will be more &s;trongly attracted by each other than by the Fluid in which they are &s;u&s;pended, and con&s;equently will &s;epa|rate from it, and unite in one &s;olid Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THAT any of the&s;e three Cau&s;es may &s;ingly produce &s;uch a Concrete, if they exi&s;t in the Degree laid down, is prov'd from the Nature of <HI>Salts in general,</HI> when in <HI>Fluore,</HI> and the Con|&s;equences that mu&s;t follow from their being brought too much within the Sphere of each others Activity; more particularly from the Nature of <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> of which the <HI>Stone</HI> con&s;i&s;ts; which are &s;o very attractive, that even when a <HI>Calculus</HI> is reduc'd to a <HI>Caput Mortuum,</HI> and beat into an impalpable Powder, &s;o that it will di&s;&s;olve in Water, yet in a &s;hort time the Salts will &s;e|parate from it, and coagulate &s;o &s;trongly, that though the Wa|ter is heated never &s;o inten&s;ely, they will not di&s;&s;olve in it again.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it is rea&s;onable to think, that a <HI>Nucleus</HI> of a firm Con&s;i&s;tence is &s;eldom form'd by the fir&s;t or &s;econd Cau&s;e, without the Concurrence of the la&s;t; as on the other hand, that the la&s;t alone will produce one. For though there &s;hould be an over large Quantity of Salts in the Urine, or if an u&s;ual Quantity &s;hould be envellop'd in a vi&s;cid Matter, yet if the <HI>urinary Ducts</HI> are of a natural Dimen&s;ion, they would not &s;tagnate at the <HI>Papillae,</HI> unle&s;s the&s;e Qualities were in a very great degree; but would be protruded through their Orifices by the force and weight of the next Urine flowing upon them:
<PB N="35" REF="42">whereas if the&s;e Ducts &s;hould be much contracted, even a natu|ral proportion of Salts would &s;tagnate there. And I think it is plainly prov'd, that a <HI>Nucleus</HI> is form'd more from the Fault of the <HI>Kidney</HI> it &s;elf, than from the Qualities of the Urine; in that <HI>one</HI> Kidney only is generally affected, whil&s;t the other remains free. For if the Fault lay as much in the Urine, they would <HI>both</HI> be affected alike, the U|rine &s;eparated by <HI>both Kidneys</HI> nece&s;&s;arily partaking of the &s;ame Qualities. However, that the two fir&s;t are concomitant Cau&s;es, and very much contribute towards the Generation of a <HI>Stone</HI> is highly probable; and it is almo&s;t certain, that a &s;a|bulous Sediment, or what is call'd the <HI>Gravel,</HI> may owe its Origin to either of the&s;e Cau&s;es &s;ingly.</P>
<P>AS a farther Confirmation of the Truth of what has been laid down, it were ea&s;y to &s;hew, that the antecedent Cau&s;es of a Nephritick Fit introduce one or both of the&s;e Qualities in the Urine, or affect the Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> in the manner ju&s;t mention'd: but as it will be troubling you with frequent Repe|titions of the &s;ame way of Rea&s;oning, to explain how each in particular operates towards producing one or more of the&s;e Effects, I &s;hall mention the chief and mo&s;t common procatartick Cau&s;es, which are comprehended in the following Ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> that tho&s;e Per&s;ons who make <HI>&s;pirituous Liquors</HI> their con&s;tant Drink, and u&s;e them too plentifully; or tho&s;e who have <HI>weak Stomachs,</HI> or live upon Food that abounds with <HI>vi&s;cid Juices;</HI> or tho&s;e who altogether lead an <HI>unactive</HI> and <HI>&s;edentary Life,</HI> are, above all others, mo&s;t afflicted with this Di&s;temper. And that the Urine of &s;uch Per&s;ons mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be over-&s;tock'd with Salts, or with a tenacious vi&s;cid Mat|ter, or that the Channels of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> will be too much &s;traitned or compre&s;s'd according as either of the&s;e Cau&s;es prevail, will appear upon Examination.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> IN the fir&s;t Part of this Ob&s;ervation it is to be taken notice of, that all <HI>&s;pirituous Liquors</HI> abound plentifully with Salts; a Spirit being nothing el&s;e but a large Quantity of the&s;e Sub&s;tances &s;u&s;pended in a little Water and Oil; whence from frequent drinking the&s;e Liquors the Blood will be over-&s;tock'd
<PB N="36" REF="43">with this <HI>Principle.</HI> But be&s;ides this, from an habitual U&s;e of them, in proce&s;s of Time, the <HI>Serum</HI> which is the mo&s;t aque|ous part of the Blood, will contain a large Portion of a &s;piri|tuous Fluid; and we know from Experiments, that a urinous Salt will not di&s;&s;olve in &s;uch a <HI>Men&s;truum:</HI> upon which ac|count the Quantity of Salts brought into the Blood with our Food will be daily encreas'd. Now the Urine being &s;eparated principally and immediately from the <HI>Serum,</HI> which is over &s;alt upon a double account, mu&s;t likewi&s;e from the Nature of its Secretion be over &s;alt too.</P>
<P>HENCE we can account why the Fits of the <HI>Stone</HI> are not &s;o &s;evere in Women as in Men; they generally drinking le&s;s Wine, and feeding le&s;s upon &s;uch gro&s;s Meats as abound with Salts. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on we may conclude, that the Exemption tho&s;e Per&s;ons enjoy from this Di&s;temper, who only drink Malt Liquors, is owing a great deal to the le&s;&s;er Quantity of Salts in the&s;e Potables, than in Wine.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> AS an over &s;alt Urine is the Con&s;equence of the fore|going Cau&s;e, &s;o from a <HI>bad Dige&s;tion</HI> and <HI>vi&s;cid Food</HI> the Urine will be &s;limy and roapy. For the Aliment being too vi&s;cid, or not &s;ufficiently comminuted in the Stomach, the Chyle will be more than ordinary vi&s;cid, which being con&s;tantly &s;ent into the Blood, will render that in &s;ome time of the &s;ame Nature. But over and above this, the Salts which are the mo&s;t incor|ruptible part of our Food, being not thoroughly broken through the weakne&s;s of the dige&s;tive Powers, will exi&s;t in larger Combi|nations than u&s;ual; and at the &s;ame time be enclos'd in a gelati|nous Chyle, which will hold them together; for which rea&s;on the Blood will not only be too vi&s;cid, but the Salts of it will not be &s;ufficiently di&s;&s;olv'd in its <HI>Serum;</HI> whence it follows from the &s;ame Rea&s;oning as in the former, that the Urine mu&s;t be likewi&s;e too vi&s;cid, and its Salts brought too near one another, which will occa&s;ion them to cohere. From hence it appears, that <HI>Galen</HI> did not altogether err, when he attributed the material Cau&s;e of a <HI>Stone</HI> to a thick, &s;limy, and tenacious Matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Renum affect.</NOTE>, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="37" REF="44">with&s;tanding his Notion has been rejected by &s;everal modern Writers: &s;ince being thus explain'd as a concomitant Cau&s;e, it is agreeable both to Rea&s;on and Fact.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find, that Children are more tor|mented with the <HI>Stone</HI> of the <HI>Bladder</HI> than Adults; and e&s;pe|cially the poorer &s;ort of them who are generally nouri&s;h'd with Food that affords &s;limy and tenacious Juices. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> a|&s;cribes one Principle of the <HI>Stone</HI> in Children to bad <HI>Milk;</HI> which he &s;ays, being earthy and phlegmatick, will induce a Len|tor into the Stomach, and when mix'd with the Sediment of the Urine in the Bladder cohere and become &s;olid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. de Morbis 4.

<P>BUT when the <HI>Stone</HI> moves into the <HI>head of the &V;reter,</HI> and twitches and di&s;tracts its extreme &s;en&s;ible Membranes, the Pain will be <HI>acute, pungent</HI> and <HI>lancing,</HI> and all the other Symp|toms vehemently exaggerated.

<P>THERE will be a <HI>Numbne&s;s</HI> felt in the <HI>Thigh</HI> and <HI>Leg</HI> of the &s;ide affected, both by rea&s;on that the <HI>P&s;oas Mu&s;cle,</HI> upon which the <HI>Kidney</HI> and <HI>&V;reter</HI> lay, will be compre&s;s'd by this extraneous Body; and fora&s;much as the <HI>Nerve</HI> that is &s;ent off from the Spinal Marrow, and is di&s;tributed through the <HI>Crural</HI> Mu&s;cles will undergo the like Compre&s;&s;ion: whence the free Influx of the Animal Spirits into the Mu&s;cles being partly taken off, &s;uch a Sen&s;ation will naturally ari&s;e.

<P>THIS convul&s;ive Contraction from the Violence of the Pain, will be propagated to all the Parts that lie contiguous, and have any near Relation to tho&s;e immediately affected.

<P>BUT there is another Rea&s;on, be&s;ides this now given, why the Urine at the beginning of a Fit &s;hould be pale, and made in &s;mall Quantities, but in its Decline become turbid and di&s;charg'd copiou&s;ly, which at the &s;ame time has no relation to the Nature of the <HI>Stone;</HI> and that is, becau&s;e this praeternatural Sub&s;tance irritating the <HI>Kidney,</HI> the <HI>Tubuli &V;rinarii,</HI> which are the &s;epara|ting Canals, will be very much contracted, as lying &s;o near the greate&s;t Force of the <HI>Stimulus:</HI> by which means, there will not only be very little &V;rine &s;eparated during &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces, but likewi&s;e what is, will be thinner than u&s;ual, the more gro&s;s Parts of it not being &s;mall enough to pa&s;s through their Orifices in this contracted State; or if they do, will &s;tagnate at the <HI>Papillae.</HI> And the&s;e Effects will be propagated in &s;ome de|gree

<P>IF we reflect on the Nature of the&s;e various Diagno&s;ticks, we &s;hall find, that though all of them taken together are Direc|tion &s;ufficient to pronounce the Complaint to be the <HI>Stone,</HI> yet when con&s;ider'd &s;eparately, many of them are <HI>equivocal,</HI> and may &s;pring from other Cau&s;es: and it is commonly known, that the Symptoms of the <HI>Cholick</HI> bear &s;o near a re&s;emblance to many of the&s;e, that it is frequently difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h between them. Indeed when any of the <HI>Pathognomonick</HI> Signs appear, as Sand or &s;mall Stones in the Urine, the Cau&s;e &s;tands confe&s;s'd; or if the Urine is bloody, and a Numbne&s;s perceiv'd in the Thigh and Leg, we may know that it is not the <HI>Cholick:</HI> but when none of the&s;e &s;hew them&s;elves, the Cau&s;e is &s;till latent, and mu&s;t be di&s;cover'd by &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;ticks peculiar to it &s;elf.

<P>THE Symptoms likewi&s;e that ari&s;e when the <HI>Kidneys</HI> are <HI>hy&s;terically</HI> affected, mimick a Nephritick Fit, not only in the Nature and Situation of the Pain, and the exorbitant Vomiting which attends it, but al&s;o in the Propagation of it into the <HI>&V;re|ters, &amp;c.</HI> and are not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd, unle&s;s from the <HI>pre|vious Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the Patient to one Complaint more than the other, or from the di&s;charge of a <HI>porraceous</HI> Matter by Vomit, or from the con&s;tant <HI>Limpidne&s;s</HI> of the Urine, which

<HEAD>SECT. III. PART II. Of a STONE in the BLADDER.</HEAD>
<P>_WE come now to con&s;ider the Con&s;equences that will follow, when a <HI>Stone</HI> has chang'd its Seat, and lodg'd &s;ome time in the <HI>Bladder.</HI> That a <HI>Nucleus</HI> genera|ted in the <HI>Kidney,</HI> when once receiv'd into this <HI>Or|gan,</HI> is the general Ba&s;is of tho&s;e large Concretions found in it, is evident from in&s;pecting the&s;e Bodies; in the Centre of which for the mo&s;t part is found a &s;olid Sub&s;tance, of a different Co|lour and Con&s;i&s;tence from the re&s;t of the &s;tony Integuments, over which the adventitious Concretions are &s;pread <HI>lamellatim,</HI> and enclo&s;e it as a Shell does the Kernel of a Nut. Not but that a <HI>Stone</HI> may be primarily generated here, without the <HI>Kidneys</HI> being fir&s;t affected: which not only appears in Chil|dren, who are frequently troubled with this Di&s;ea&s;e without the lea&s;t previous Complaint of Nephritick Symptoms, but likewi&s;e from the rea&s;on of the thing: For if the &s;olid Parts of the Urine &s;hould be depo&s;ited in the Bladder in &s;uch manner, as to be brought near to one another, and not be wa&s;h'd away by a fol|lowing Afflux, they will unite by means of their attractive Powers. This will happen if the Urine is over <HI>vi&s;cid</HI> and too much loaded with <HI>&s;aline</HI> and <HI>earthy</HI> Principles: for if it &s;tays any con&s;iderable time before it is voided, the&s;e will &s;ub&s;ide to the Bottom by their own Gravity; where they will con&s;equent|ly be brought into a narrow Compa&s;s, and at the &s;ame time may adhere to it by the Tenacity of the Parts that envellope them. Accordingly con&s;tant Ob&s;ervation tallies with it; the Urine of Per&s;ons &s;ubject to the&s;e Complaints being generally <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>vi&s;cid,</HI> and dropping a <HI>whiti&s;h Sediment</HI> which &s;ticks to the bot|tom of the Ve&s;&s;el it is contain'd in. Thus then there may be a
<PB N="50" REF="57"><HI>Stone</HI> form'd in the <HI>Bladder</HI> without a <HI>Nucleus</HI> previou&s;ly gene|rated in the <HI>Kidney:</HI> but this is not near &s;o frequent; for the <HI>Bladder</HI> being a large Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;o often di&s;tended with Urine, &s;uch a Depo&s;ition of the &s;olid Contents will very rarely happen; but they will either flow out with the aqueous Vehicle, or el&s;e be wa&s;h'd away by the weight of the Urine that &s;o often falls upon them: whereas a <HI>Nucleus</HI> already form'd being a &s;olid concrete and <HI>ponderous,</HI> it may be &s;o lodg'd, that the Urine may pa&s;s over it, or its Surface &s;o pointed as to adhere too clo&s;ely to be &s;epa|rated: and accordingly we find, that <HI>Stones</HI> are form'd in, the <HI>Bladder,</HI> when any <HI>extraneous</HI> &s;olid Bodies have accidentally got in there, which have been the Foundation of the &s;ub&s;equent Incru&s;tations, of which there are many In&s;tances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act.</HI> N^o. 168. 171. 266.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Ba&s;is of a <HI>Calculus</HI> being laid in this manner, it will nece&s;&s;arily encrea&s;e if it &s;tays any con&s;iderable time there. For as it con&s;i&s;ts of a Sub&s;tance, which in its Nature is very attractive, it will draw the &s;olid Particles of the Urine to it, which are of the &s;ame Nature, and will therefore &s;eparate from the Fluid and adhere to its Surface: and this attractive Power will be greater as the Surface of this &s;olid Body grows larger; &s;o that a Ba&s;is once form'd, the <HI>Stone</HI> will become large in a &s;horter time than is commonly imagin'd: every new Incru&s;tation not only adding to the Quantity of Matter, but encrea&s;ing the Surface in a very great Proportion. The Di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal <HI>Lamellae</HI> that compo&s;e the <HI>Calculus,</HI> &s;hews that it encrea&s;es in this way: for their running <HI>parallel</HI> to one another can be only owing to this force of <HI>Attraction;</HI> by which the &s;olid Particles of the Urine, when brought to a certain Di&s;tance from the <HI>Concretion,</HI> are im|pell'd towards it, and unite them&s;elves to it on all &s;ides, at equal Di&s;tances from its Centre, as near as the Figure of the Place in which it is lodg'd will allow of.</P>
<P>FROM hence it appears, that the <HI>Stones</HI> of the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and <HI>Bladder</HI> are of the <HI>&s;ame Nature,</HI> and form'd in the &s;ame man|ner; which I believe will hold good likewi&s;e in all <HI>Stones</HI> of the Body, in what&s;oever Part they are found, and how&s;oever they differ in Figure, Colour, or Weight: though the <HI>Effects</HI> produc'd
<PB N="51" REF="58">by them will vary, as they are lodg'd in <HI>one</HI> Part or <HI>another.</HI> When &s;uch a Sub&s;tance is in the <HI>Bladder,</HI> it will produce the <HI>following.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AT fir&s;t,</HI> little or no Di&s;turbance will ari&s;e from it; becau&s;e being &s;mall and light, the <HI>Mucus</HI> that lines the <HI>Bladder</HI> is &s;uffici|ent to guard it from the hardne&s;s and a&s;perity of its Surface; on|ly the Urine is now and then <HI>intercepted</HI> in its Voidance, when the <HI>Stone</HI> ca&s;ually falls upon the Orifice of the <HI>&V;rethra.</HI> But when it grows larger and more weighty it will abrade this Muco|&s;ity, and twitch and vellicate the nervous Coat; more e&s;pecially when it moves from one place to another. Hence the Urine will become <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>&s;limy</HI> from the abraded <HI>Mucus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">n="*" Hippocratis Aphori&s;m. 79.

This <HI>Stimu|lus</HI> at the &s;ame time will extend farther, and create a <HI>Pain</HI> in the Neck of the <HI>Bladder,</HI> which will increa&s;e towards the end of <HI>Micturition,</HI> and be propagated towards the end of the <HI>Glans;</HI> the one becau&s;e the <HI>Calculus</HI> falls to its more depending part, the <HI>Neck,</HI> the other becau&s;e the nervous Coat of the <HI>&V;rethra</HI> is no more than the Continuation of the &s;ame nervous Membrane: and it is no wonder, that when the&s;e Parts, which lie &s;o near, endure a <HI>Pain,</HI> that the more <HI>di&s;tant</HI> of the procreative Organs &s;hould enjoy only a <HI>Pruritus.</HI> As the Bulk of the <HI>Stone</HI> increa|&s;es, it will pre&s;s more forcibly upon the&s;e Parts, from whence the Pain will become more <HI>inten&s;e,</HI> and a <HI>Weight</HI> perceiv'd in the Region of the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> and in <HI>Perinaeo:</HI> and the Irritation it produces will be extended farther to the <HI>Sphincter Ani</HI> and <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum,</HI> both the&s;e being contiguous to this Part, and receiving Branches from the <HI>&s;ame Nerve;</HI> &s;o that a De&s;ire of <HI>going to &s;tool</HI> will come upon every Attempt to <HI>make water.</HI> This mu&s;t be very <HI>frequent</HI> by rea&s;on of the continual <HI>Stimulus</HI> upon the <HI>Bladder,</HI> which will provoke it to di&s;charge its Con|tents; but at the &s;ame time it will be voided with the <HI>greate&s;t difficulty,</HI> and <HI>guttatim,</HI> from the Stones lying upon the Ori|fice of the <HI>&V;rethra,</HI> and &s;topping it up: &s;o that the Pa|tient is obliged &s;ometimes to lie in a <HI>&s;upine Po&s;ture,</HI> in or|der to remove it from thence before the Urine will pa&s;s off. Hence it is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing, that when this Body has accu|mulated,
<PB N="52" REF="59" MS="y">it &s;hould occa&s;ion a <HI>difficulty</HI> of <HI>moving</HI> from place to place, &s;ince the Pre&s;&s;ure of it upon the lower Parts is &s;o great.</P>

In this Ca&s;e it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible but the mo&s;t skilful Surgeon &s;hould be deceiv'd; for the&s;e concre|ted Sub&s;tances gave the &s;ame Re&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Catheter,</HI> and caus'd the &s;ame Sen&s;ation to the Hand that a <HI>Stone</HI> would, when in the Cavity of the <HI>Bladder.</HI> However it was very lucky for this Gentleman, con&s;idering the cen&s;orious Humour of the World, that the Patient died before he underwent the Operation.
