<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that Fe|vers have always been more frequent, and done more gene|ral Mi&s;chief, than any other Di&s;orders what&s;oever; that they
<PB N="iv" REF="3">have often produced grievous and fatal Effects, even when they have ari&s;en from Accidents, &s;ee|mingly, not dangerous; and that, far from being confined to the infirm, and Valetudina|ry, they are mo&s;t apt to &s;eize upon, and de&s;troy Bodies, that are young, Vigorous, and &s;ound.</P>
<P>THESE Ob&s;ervations have long &s;ince induced me to endeavour to point out &s;ome Means (ea&s;y, and intelligible to the generality
<PB N="v" REF="4">of People) to prevent, at lea&s;t in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, &s;o great an Evil; and I have fixed upon tho&s;e as the mo&s;t probable and au|thentic, which are mentioned in the following E&s;&s;ay. For, in making Choice of them, I have not been influenced by any <HI>Hypothetical</HI> Rea&s;oning, how plau&s;ible &s;oever; but I have proceeded, &s;olely, upon the &s;ure Footing of &s;uch Ob&s;er|vations of Phi&s;itians, as have been confirmed by long, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">accurate Experience, and hand|ed down to us through many &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e &s;ubjoined a &s;hort and plain, Account of the Production of the Symptoms of Fevers, as evidently deduced from Experience, and Ob&s;erva|tion; which Account, perhaps, I &s;hall hereafter attempt to illu&s;trate, and enlarge. But I &s;hould be much better plea&s;ed to find &s;ome abler Per&s;on
<PB N="vii" REF="6">excited, by the&s;e imperfect Hints, to take that Ta&s;k out of my Hands.</P>

<HEAD>AN ASSAY ON Ordinary FEVERS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> Of the Cau&s;es by which Ordina|ry Fevers are often made grievous, and mortal.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. WHAT<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Medecin. p. 112.</NOTE> CELSUS has in&s;inuated, concerning Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, is, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, applicable to tho&s;e that are called Acute, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are &s;eldom mortal in their own Na|ture:
<PB N="2" REF="13">
<Q>"And that, if a Phi&s;itian's Advice, is followed from their Be|ginning, hardly any dye of them, unle&s;s through his Fault."</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. FOR the fir&s;t Attacks of Fe|vers, (even of &s;uch as are mo&s;t dange|rous) are generally &s;o light, that People are apt to per&s;uade them&s;elves, that they can ea&s;ily get rid of them, with|out the Pain of Confinement, or a &s;trict Regimen; and therefore many are &s;een walking abroad, for &s;ome Days, with the Sickne&s;s upon them&punc; every Hour increa&s;ing. And when they are at length forced to lye down under the Burden, which they find them|&s;elves unable to &s;hake off, they often think they act a prudent Part in deli|vering them&s;elves up to the Manage|ment
<PB N="3" REF="14">of Per&s;ons, who (through a fa|tal, and too common Mi&s;take) are deemed able, and hone&s;t enough to cure every &s;light, feveri&s;h Di&s;order.</P>
<P N="3">III. AND in this Sen&s;e it is &s;trictly true, that many ordinary Fevers have been made grievous, and mortal, which, if rightly handled in the Begining, would not have been attended with a|ny con&s;iderable Prejudice.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THERE is likewi&s;e &s;ome Rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the commonly-re|ceived Opinion of the Nature of the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es has a tendency to retard, and &s;ometimes ab&s;olutely to hinder their Cure. The Opinion I mean, is, <Q>"that a Fever is excited by a Foulne&s;s, or Di&s;temperature in the Blood, which
<PB N="4" REF="15">is, for that Rea&s;on, called the Febrile Matter; that this Di&s;order it&s;elf is a kind of In&s;trument which Na|ture makes U&s;e of to clear the Blood of that Foulne&s;s; that (as<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Etmull. de feb. p. 217. Bagliv. prax. p. 231.</NOTE> in the Depuration of Wine, and other fer|mentative Liquors) a certain num|ber of Days is nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on, and completing this &s;alutary Work, and therefore that we ought not to think of removing this Fe|brile Matter in the beginning of the Sickne&s;s, while it is yet Crude; nor until &s;uch Time, as by &s;ome parti|cular Signs, it &s;hall be found &s;o at|tenuated, and concocted, as to be fit for what is called a Critical Ex|pul&s;ion out of the Body."</Q></P>
<PB N="5" REF="16">
<P N="5">V. THIS Opinion, I &s;ay, &s;eems to be attended with no &s;mall Danger on ac|count, among other Things, of the De|lay, and inaction which it nece&s;&s;arily implys on the Part of the Phi&s;itian. And I know not any<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bagl. prax. &amp; Epi&s;t. ad Andry. Archb. Pitcairn Di&s;&s;. de Opera quam Pre&s;t. Corpa. Acida vel Alcal. &amp;c.</NOTE> Evacuation what|&s;oever (bleeding it&s;elf not excepted) which, according to it, can with &s;afety be advi&s;ed in the Beginning of Fevers; or even until the Signs of Coction ap|pear in them. For, as before this Time, no Separation is made of the pretended morbid Humors from the &s;ound, bleed|ing, and every other Evacuation that is then put in Practice, mu&s;t indi&s;crimi|nately take away both; and perhaps, more of the Trea&s;ure of Life, than of the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e! And when the
<PB N="6" REF="17">Signs of<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Cogno&s;citur Coctio I^0 quiete morbi, eju&s;&abque; decremento, &amp;c. Boerh. In&s;t.</NOTE> Coction have once appear|ed, every arteficial Evacuation is, gene|rally &s;peaking, u&s;ele&s;s, if not hurtful. For, when Nature has of her&s;elf done &s;o much towards a Cure in this, or any other Di&s;order, as to have brought about tho&s;e Appearances by which the Coction of the Humours is &s;aid to be known, &s;he &s;eldom or never &s;tands in need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Art to enable her to complete it.</P>
<P N="6">VI. BUT the Truth is, that this Opi|nion had its ri&s;e in the very infancy of Phi&s;ick; when Phi&s;itians were rather Ob&s;ervers than A&s;&s;i&s;tants of Nature; which latter, however, they afterwards became in an eminent Degree, by
<PB N="7" REF="18">Means chiefly of &s;uch Ob&s;ervation; and hence it was that few or no Mede|cines were then pre&s;cribed by them in the&s;e, or any other Di&s;orders.</P>
<P N="7">VII. IF what we are told concerning putrid Fevers, and the morbific Mat|ter in them be true, <HI>viz,</HI> that they con|&s;i&s;t as<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Method. 11.</NOTE> GALEN affirms, in a Change of the whole Body into Corruption; or, as modern Phi&s;itians more cautiou&s;ly expre&s;s it, that they are cau&s;ed by an Al|kale&s;cence, or Degree of putrefaction in the Ma&s;s of Blood, the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e who are &s;ick of them mu&s;t be very de|plorable. For, to omit other Rea&s;ons, &s;uch a State of the Blood can be amen|ded by no other Medecines, but a &s;uf|ficient Quantity of Acids intimately
<PB N="8" REF="19">mixed, and blended with it; but this cannot be done by Acids given in the U&s;ual way; for it is known by<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Boyle Apud. Pitcair. Di&s;&s;. de O|pera quam pre&s;t, &amp;c. Arbuth. on Aliments.</NOTE> Ex|perience, that all acid Vegetables are very much altered in the Stomach and Guts; and that they are even made al|kale&s;cent, before they are Received in|to the Blood; and it is highly probable, that no Mineral Acids can be admitted through the Mouths of the lacteal Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. AND &s;uch &s;hocking Ideas of any Di&s;temper, when entertained by the Sick, are apt to make it, tho' light in its own Nature, both grie|vous, and mortal. For<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Barth. in Act. Haffn. Vol. 1. Ob&s;. 76.</NOTE> great anxi|ety of Mind has often produced dan|gerous, and malignant Fevers in Bo|dies,
<PB N="9" REF="20">that were otherwi&s;e Sound. And<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Bag. p. 158. Hodg. de Pe&s;t. p. 1, 2.</NOTE> Writers of good Credit A&s;&s;ure us that, in the Beginning of the Plague it&s;elf, Numbers have been &s;eized with that Di&s;ea&s;e, and Dyed of it, who Contracted it rather through fear of &s;o great an Evil, than by any Contagion.</P>
<P N="9">IX. FROM the critical Evacuations in Fevers having, very often, a &s;trong, fetid Smell, and other Signs of Corrup|tion in them, it has been generally concluded, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been derived from an infected Source; and that the &s;ame morbid State of the whole Ma&s;s of Humours mu&s;t, therefore, have given ri&s;e to the&s;e Di&s;tempers. But it may be as well in|fered that an har&s;h ill-&s;cented Per&s;pi|ration,
<PB N="10" REF="21">to which many People enjoy|ing good Health are &s;ubject, can be thought to &s;hew, that the Blood of &s;uch People is in a State of Putrefaction, or that their Bodies are infected with putrid Fevers,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Gouraigne de feb. p. 275.</NOTE> If a Vein be opened in the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, while the mo&s;t faetid Sweat is ouzing thro' the Pores of the Skin, there &s;hall not be found the lea&s;t, di&s;agreeable Smell, or Ta&s;te in the Blood that is drawn. And there|fore all that can be concluded from the above-mentioned Evacuations, is, that as the Matter of them is always ob&s;tructed, or otherwi&s;e altered in the Emuncto|rys them&s;elves,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Gorter de Secret. hum. a San|guine.</NOTE> (which may happen many different Ways) they mu&s;t, nece&s;|&s;arily have &s;omething preternatural in
<PB N="11" REF="22">them, without implying, at the &s;ame Time, any original Impurity, or Cor|ruption in the Ma&s;s of Blood, from whence they were derived.</P>
<P N="10">X. <Q>"The Humours that are critically ca&s;t forth in the Decline of Fevers, &s;ays the juditious <HI>(b)</HI> SYDENHAM on this Occa&s;ion, are no doubt vitious, although the Blood was before pure. But this is not more to be wondered at, than that &s;ome Part of our Food is made corrupt, and faetid, after having undergone a con&s;iderable change in the Body, and been &s;eparated from the re&s;t."</Q></P>
<P N="11">XI. UPON the whole, the Notion of a febrile Matter has not always been &s;o univer&s;ally entertained by Phi&s;i|tians,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">De Febrib. p. 30.</NOTE>
<PB N="12" REF="23">as &s;ome would have us believe&punc; for we learn from<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Medecin. p. 118.</NOTE> CELSUS that AES|CLEPIADES, who had many Follow|ers, &s;eemed to &s;hew no Regard to it in the Cure of Fevers. And many emi|nent Phi&s;itians, &s;ays<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">De prae&s;ag. Vit. &amp; Mor. p. 346.</NOTE> PROSPER AL|PINUS, have maintained that good, and profitable Evacuations have happened in the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, before the Signs of Coc|tion appeared in them. As for pu|trid Fevers, TRALLIAN expre&s;ly<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">De Feb. p. 685, 686. Vid. Fore&s;t. de Feb. p. 87. Fernel. p. 453.</NOTE> a&s;&s;ures us, that it was the Opinion of &s;everal among the Antients, that they do not ari&s;e from the Corruption of any other Humours, but tho&s;e that are contained in the Stomach and Guts, and that the vital Juices cannot be the
<PB N="13" REF="24">Subject of Putrefaction in the&s;e Ca&s;es. And<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">De Feb. p. 30.</NOTE> SYDENHAM, among the Mo|derns, does not &s;cruple to affirm, that Fevers happen more frequently, without the Concurrence of any vitious Parti|cles in the Blood, than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that it was a Point agreed upon by all the<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Part the 2d. of this E&s;&s;ay.</NOTE> an|tient Phi&s;itians, that DIARY Fevers are not excited by any peccant Matter in|herent in the Blood, or humors; and that they were accordingly cured by them, in a very &s;hort Time, and by the &s;imple&s;t Methods. But although the&s;e Fevers were formerly accounted harmle&s;s, (and in their own Nature in|deed they are &s;o) yet we now often &s;ee
<PB N="14" REF="25">them made griveous, and mortal, by Ignorance and Neglect. For it is my De&s;ign to &s;hew hereafter, that the Fe|vers, which now-adays do &s;o much Mi&s;chief among us, for the mo&s;t Part ari&s;e from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, and are of the &s;ame Nature, with the DIARY in their Beginning.</P>
<P N="13">XIII AND it may be no improper Introduction to this De&s;ign, to take Notice before-hand, of that dangerous Cu&s;tom, (&s;o prevalent of late, though contrary to the Sentiments of the be&s;t Phi&s;itians,) of Bleeding, Purging, and Vomiting in the Beginning of all Fevers without Di&s;tinction. For although the&s;e Remedys, when admini&s;tered with Judgment, are of the greate&s;t Service to the &s;ick; yet nothing is more cer|tain, than that an improper Application
<PB N="15" REF="26">of any of them, may make Nature<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Nihil mirum &s;i frequenter ob&s;ervamus aegros po&s;t Ordinatam Plebotomiam interire Sta|tim &mdash; idem&abque;.

The following extraordinary Ca&s;e, and the Ob&s;ervations naturally ari&s;ing there|from, may &s;erve to put this Matter in a clearer Light.</P>
<P N="17">XVII IN the Year 1738, a Man, of about fifty, was brought to the CHA|RITABLE INFIRMARY on the INS|QUAY, DUBLIN, with a Tumor in his Groin, which in due Time, and by proper Applications, came to Suppu|ration. He had complained, for &s;ome
<PB N="19" REF="30">Time before he was taken in there, of an Unea&s;ine&s;s, and Shooting Pain in the Part affected, but of no other Sick|ne&s;s. However, when this Tumor was opened, &s;ome Bones of a Chickens|neck were extracted from it; by which, and the Patients own Confe&s;&s;ion, it appeared, that he had &s;ome Weeks be|fore, ha&s;tily &s;wallowed down the&s;e Bones unchewed; and that they had gradually<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid.

This Man eate, and &s;lept well, when I &s;aw him; and he had done &s;o from the very Beginning of his Complaint, as he him&s;elf avered. And, while in the INFIRMARY, he was free from every Feveri&s;h Symptom,
<PB N="20" REF="31">except what the Suppuration of his Tumor naturally occa&s;ioned. Of this I was a&s;&s;ured by Mr. FRANCIS DUA|NY, one of the Surgeons of that IN|FIRMARY, who had often vi&s;ited him while he was there, and by whom I &s;aw &s;ome of the&s;e Bones taken out intire, with great Dexterity. Mr. DUA|NY likewi&s;e informed me, that Mr. KELLY, in his Turn of Vi&s;iting, had al&s;o extracted, from this Per&s;on, &s;ome Bones of the &s;ame Kind.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Now if an Irritation of the Inte&s;tines, which was &s;o great, that it at length de&s;troyed Part of their Sub|&s;tance, did not produce any con&s;iderable Fever (which as I have &s;aid is indeed an extraordinary Ca&s;e) may it not ea&s;ily happen, that the &s;o much feebler Stimu|lus
<PB N="21" REF="32">of indige&s;ted Humours on the&s;e Parts, may be often hindred, by the MUCUS which defends them, from having any &s;uch Effect? And as in Ca&s;e a Fever had en&s;ued from that great Irritation, an Attempt to carry off the&s;e Bones by a Stimulating Purge, would in all probability, have increa&s;ed the Evil,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid.

And a more ex|cellent Remedy, adds he, I know not for tho&s;e who, being of an hot Tempe|rament, fall into DIARY Fevers from &s;uch a Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. In like Manner, when the Rigors, that commonly introduce Fe|vers, are cau&s;ed, as they often are, by
<PB N="23" REF="34">bilious Humors lying in the Stomach, and a Vomit is therefore wanting to Di&s;charge them,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Medecin. p. 141.</NOTE> CELSUS directs nothing el&s;e for that End, but warm Water, &s;ea&s;oned with a little Salt. And as the Caution of the Antients, in the&s;e Particulars, was wi&s;e, and worthy of Imi|tation, &s;o is the Ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome modern Practitioners, as much to be dreaded and avoided. For there is, (much oftener than is vulgarly imagined) an<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Frederic. Hoff. Di&s;&s;ert. de inflam.

<P N="20">XX. BUT if Bleeding, Purging, and Vomiting in the Beginning of all Fevers without Di&s;tinction, have often done Mi&s;chief, there is not le&s;s to be feared from the too dilatory Practice of tho&s;e who, as we have already ob&s;erved, have nothing el&s;e in View, in the Cure of the&s;e Di&s;tempers, but the gradual Correction, or di&s;tant Expul&s;ion of
<PB N="25" REF="36">&s;ome preconceived foulne&s;s of the Blood, or Humours. For while &s;uch are wait|ing for the imaginary Coction of a FEBRILE MATTER, they are fre|quently Suffering the real Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e to take &s;uch deep Root in &s;ome of the noble Parts, that it cannot, per|haps, be afterwards removed from thence, by any Efforts of Nature, or Art.</P>

As I had taken no Nouri&s;hment through the whole Day, I then refre&s;hed my|&s;elf with a little Ale, in which a &s;mall Quantity of Sugar, and Butter was boiled; and about &s;ix I went into a warm Bed, where covering my&s;elf up, I begun to Sweat.

And although this
<PB N="35" REF="46">was done chiefly by external Appli|cations, &s;uch as Baths of warm Water, Friction, and Unction; yet inward Means were &s;ometimes found proper for the &s;ame End, according to the Nature, and Exigence of the particular Cau&s;e. <Q>"Thus CASSIUS, the mo&s;t in|genious Phi&s;itian of our Age, &s;ays<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Praef.

<P>ALTHOUGH<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Gort. de Feb.</NOTE> it be ex|tremely difficult, to give an exact Definition of the Nature of Fevers, on Account of the great Variety of their Cau&s;es, and Symptoms; yet we are &s;ure to find in all Bodies, affected with them, a SICKNESS, that is generally brought oh by a COLDNESS and SHUDDERING, to which a BURN|ING
<PB N="52" REF="63">HEAT &s;ucceeds; and la&s;tly a SWEAT breaks forth, by which an End is put to all the Symptoms.</P>
<P>AND it is plain, from<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fred. Hoffn. de Feb.</NOTE> the dry|ne&s;s, and Contraction of the external Parts of the Body, in the Beginning of the&s;e Di&s;tempers; from the Smallne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, the Coldne&s;s of the Hands and Feet, and the Sub&s;iding of the Ve&s;&s;els in them: from the Breathing difficult, and the Feeling of Blood, as it were, boil about the Praecordia; <Q>"from all the&s;e Things, I &s;ay, happen|ing in the Beginning of Fevers, it is plain<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE> that the vital Fluids are, then, fir&s;t driven, from the Surface, of the Body, into the internal, large
<PB N="53" REF="64">Ve&s;&s;els, and towards the Heart; and that the&s;e Fluids are, afterwards, by the increa&s;ed Contraction of the Heart, and Arterys, &s;wiftly and for|ceably pu&s;hed outwards into the nar|rower Ve&s;&s;els; until &s;uch Time as, by the Removal of the Spa&s;ms, the u&s;ual Secretions return, and the Fever cea&s;es."</Q></P>
<P>THIS retrograde Motion of the vital Fluids from the con&s;tringed Surface of the Body into its Center, has been long &s;ince di&s;covered, and accurately de&s;cri|bed by<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Hypp. Foes. Lib. de flat. Fol. 298</NOTE> HYPPOCRATES him&s;elf. For, treating of the Beginning of Fevers, he tells us, <Q>"That the Blood, then, creeps over the whole Body, and runs together into its warme&s;t Parts.
<PB N="54" REF="65">&mdash; But, when, continues he, the Blood has FORSAKEN the EXTRE|MITYS, the Bowels and the Fle&s;h tremble. For &s;ome Parts of the Bo|dy are repleni&s;hed with a great Quan|tity of Blood, and others are left bloodle&s;s. And tho&s;e Parts, which the Blood has for&s;aken, cannot re&s;t through Cold, but are &s;haken; and tho&s;e Parts, which are filled with a great Quantity of Blood, tremble on account of that fullne&s;s, and INFLA|MATIONS are excited in them."</Q></P>
<P>A remarkable In&s;tance of the great Power of the con&s;triction of the Surface, in repelling whatever is therein con|tained, into the larger Cavitys of the Body, we find in<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Prax. p. 313.</NOTE> BAGLIVI, who
<PB N="55" REF="66">informs us, that when he had opened a very &s;trong Man (who had dyed of a Fever that begun with violent Rigors, &s;ucceeded by Convul&s;ions,) almo&s;t all the Fat, which had layn towards his Skin was by the great Contrac|tions of the external Fibres, driven inwards to the Center; and that in &s;uch Quantity, and &s;o di&s;&s;olved, that his lax, and flaccid Inte&s;tines were found &s;wimming in it.</P>
<P>FROM hence it follows, that the fir&s;t apparent Symptom of a Fever is a Con|&s;triction, Coldne&s;s, Rigor, or Trem|bling in the Surface of the Body, which, by driving the Blood in great Quanti|ty, from thence into the inner, and larger Ve&s;&s;els, and thereby preternatu|raly
<PB N="56" REF="67">di&s;tending them, is the<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Retrogrado enim (in Febrium Initio) &amp; morante Sanguine in Corporis Centro, quae Fluidorum, quae Solidorum exurgunt CRUDI|TATIS Signa &s;e produnt &mdash; are&s;cit os, &s;iccatur Alvus, nitent Urinae, feriantur &s;ecretiones.

Aph. 623.</NOTE> Thus the greater the Coldne&s;s, or Rigor is, at the Beginning of Fevers, the more dangerous always are the&s;e Di&s;tempers; and the Cold|ne&s;s, which U&s;hers in the Plague, is generally greate&s;t. Thus likewi&s;e what|ever Occa&s;ions a con&s;iderable, and la&s;t|ing Con&s;triction of the Surface of the
<PB N="57" REF="68">Body, as<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Fred. Hoff. de aqu. min. Vid. Gal. meth. med. lib. 8. cap. 2.</NOTE> Bathing in Waters that are too hot, or a&s;tringent, is apt to produce Fevers of all Sorts. And, on the other Hand, whatever brings about an early Removal of this Rigor, or Con&s;triction, and thereby promotes an ea&s;y, and univer&s;al Moi&s;ture of the Skin, will (as we have already &s;hewn at large in the &s;econd Part of this ESSAY) &s;peedi|ly prevent all the wor&s;t Symptoms of tho&s;e Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE Truth of this Rea&s;oning is further confirmed, by the progno&s;tic Signs that are ob&s;erved, both in Bodies recovering from the&s;e Di&s;tempers, and in tho&s;e that are dying of them. For as to the fir&s;t, Experience and Ob&s;er|vation
<PB N="58" REF="69">have always &s;hewn us, that no Fevers are completely cured, until the Skin, from being dry, and contracted, becomes all over<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Etmull. de Feb. p. 218. &amp; alios</NOTE> &s;oft, relaxed, and moi&s;t. And as to the &s;econd, it is well known, that the Continuance, and Increa&s;e of the Contraction of the Skin in the decline of the&s;e Di&s;orders, (which<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hypp. praen. Coac. Celf. Med. p. 54.</NOTE> Cold Extremitys, the Temples col|lap&s;ed, the No&s;e &s;harpened, the Eyes &s;unk, and the Drying up of I&s;&s;ues, and Ulcers plainly indicate) are but too of|ten the certain fore-runners of Death.</P>
<P>AND the Rea&s;on of the&s;e Progno&s;tics is very evident, and naturally flows from the Idea we have given of Fevers. For, as the &s;ick then only recover from
<PB N="59" REF="70">them, when, by the Removal of the Spa&s;ms in the &s;uperficial Parts of the Body, a free Pa&s;&s;age is again opened to the Humours that way, from the over|loaded VISCERA, (as in a complete and &s;alutary CRISIS) &s;o, by a too long Continuance, or great increa&s;e of the&s;e Spa&s;ms, and by the morbid Full|ne&s;s and Di&s;ten&s;ion of the Parts with|in, con&s;equent thereto, the Heart, and Brain mu&s;t, at length, be intirely di&s;abled from performing tho&s;e Func|tions, on which the Lives of all Ani|mals do ab&s;olutely depend. For this Rea&s;on it is, that the &s;ick are in<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Lom. Obs. p. 7.</NOTE> great Danger in continual Fevers, when, after a Rigor or Shuddering, they do not grow warm. Hence like|wi&s;e tho&s;e who dye of intermitting Fe|vers,
<PB N="60" REF="71">commonly expire in the Cold Fit. And in all dead Bodies the right Ven|tricle of the Heart is found very much di&s;tended with Blood.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it follows that CRUDITY in Fevers, &s;o much talked of, and &s;o little under&s;tood, is in Truth nothing el&s;e, but an<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Heq. de Purg. Med. p. 206.</NOTE> ir|regular, and devious Motion of the Vital Fluids, from the con&s;tringed Sur|face of the Body, into the VISCERA, cau&s;ing &s;uch a Fullne&s;s, and Di&s;ten&s;i|on in them, as are apt to produce the u&s;ual Symptoms of the&s;e Di&s;tempers; and that their CRISIS, therefore, con|&s;i&s;ts, not in the Expul&s;ion of any mor|bi&s;ic Matter out of the Body; but on|ly in the Removal of that Con&s;triction
<PB N="61" REF="72">of the Surface, and in an Opportunity, thereby, given to Nature to re&s;tore to the vital Juices their due, and regular Motion through all their u&s;ual Chan|nels. Wherefore the Evacuations, com|monly happening in this Period of Fe|vers, ought to be looked upon meerly as the Effects of that general Relaxation of the Solids, which then always en&s;ues; and to be helpful to the &s;ick, in no other manner, but by taking off that extraor|dinary Fullne&s;s in the Bowels, from whence all their Complaints aro&s;e.</P>
<P>AND, although, when the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es are left to them&s;elves, and Art does not interfere with them, the&s;e Evacuations, for the mo&s;t Part, happen on certain Days, which are therefore di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of CRITICAL; yet we
<PB N="62" REF="73">often find the Matter otherwi&s;e, when proper Remedys have been admini&s;tered from the Beginning, in order to put a Stop to them. For which Rea&s;on<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Etmul. Fol. 214. Helmont. de Feb. cap. XI.</NOTE> modern Phi&s;itians pay not altogether &s;o &s;crupulous a Regard to tho&s;e Days, as the Antients have done; who were more employed in ob&s;erving the Pro|gre&s;s, and Changes of Di&s;tempers, than in applying Medecines for their Cure. Thus we have already &s;hewn, from the concurring Te&s;timonys of the be&s;t Phi&s;itians, that an End may be put to ordinary Fevers on the fir&s;t, or &s;econd Day of their Appearance, though nei|ther of the&s;e Days was ever accounted CRITICAL.</P>
<P>IN this manner, may be explained
<PB N="63" REF="74">both the Symptoms, and Events of or|dinary Fevers, as ari&s;ing &s;olely from a preternatural Change in the Solid Parts of the Body; and without having Re|cour&s;e to hypothetical Conjectures of their being cau&s;ed by any acrimonious Impuritys in the Blood it&s;elf. For it is highly probable, that no &s;uch Impuri|tys can be admitted through the ex|tremely &s;mall, and delicate Orifices of the lacteal Ve&s;&s;els; and that as well on Account of the great Irritability of the&s;e Orifices, (which the Contact of every thing that is acrimonious mu&s;t immedi|ately clo&s;e) as likewi&s;e, becau&s;e the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are formed only for the Recep|tion of &s;uch a Liquor as may contribute to the Nouri&s;hment, and Pre&s;ervation of the Animal, or at lea&s;t is not de&s;truc|tive
<PB N="64" REF="75">of it. Thus we &s;ays<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">De Purg. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dec.</NOTE> HE|QUET, that a &s;ower Chyle is always refu&s;ed by them, and ca&s;t out of the Body in loo&s;e Stools. Or, if any &s;uch Impuritys, wrapt up perhaps in &s;mooch Chyle, &s;hould be &s;uffered to pa&s;s through the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els into the Blood, Nature has provided various Outlets to di&s;charge them by; and more Superfluitys of any Kind, than can be readily di&s;|charged by the&s;e Outlets, it is not rea|&s;onable to think &s;he will receive.</P>
<P>IN the Progre&s;s of Fevers indeed, when, by Means of the Spa&s;ms in the Surface, Ob&s;tructions have been alrea|dy formed in the Bowels, and the u&s;ual Secretions have been &s;topt, the Blood may become too thick, or otherwi&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="76">impure, as &s;low-moving, or &s;tagnating Waters may be foul and corrupted;<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Id ibid.</NOTE> but as this happens only &s;ecunda|rily, and by accident, it ought to be con&s;idered, in the&s;e Di&s;tempers, meet|ly as a Symptom, but never as a Cau&s;e. Thus it hath been ob&s;erved, that Fevers frequently happen to Bodies,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Syd. de Feb.</NOTE> who&s;e Humours are pure; though the&s;e Hu|mours may be afterwards tainted in the Cour&s;e of the Sickne&s;s. And it has been always remarked, that<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Lom. Obs. p. 4. &amp; alio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> putrid Fevers them&s;elves are mo&s;t incident to Per&s;ons, of a found, laudable, and well-conditioned Blood.</P>
<P>THAT the Tenacity of the Blood, in the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, is in Truth nothing
<PB N="66" REF="77">more than the Effect of tho&s;e Rigors at the Beginning of them, which &s;lac|ken, and ob&s;truct its Motion in the &s;u|perficial Parts of the Body, appears, I think, from hence, that, if Blood be drawn during tho&s;e Rigors, it &s;hall be found &s;o thick, and tenacious, as to pa&s;s with Difficulty through the Orifice that is made in the Vein; but it will be much thiner, and come out with greater Freedom, if it be drawn either &s;ometime before tho&s;e Rigors have been felt, or when they are abated.</P>
<P>AND, in general, the Appearances of Blood drawn in the&s;e, and other Di&s;tempers, are &s;o various and uncer|tain, that a prudent Phi&s;itian will hard|ly lay any Stre&s;s upon them in Chu&s;ing his Method of Cure.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Prax. p. 141.</NOTE> BAGLIVI
<PB N="67" REF="78">has ob&s;erved, that almo&s;t all tho&s;e have been recovered from acute Di&s;ea&s;es, who&s;e Blood, when drawn, was cove|red with a White, and Chylous Cru&s;t; which, however, is vulgarly looked upon as a Mark of bad, and even corrupted Blood. And<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Therapeut. p. 277.</NOTE> FREDERIC HOFF|MAN informs us, that he has often &s;een Blood, taken from &s;corbutical and hectical People, that was elegantly Red and fluid, while that which had been drawn from &s;ound, and healthy Per&s;ons, was thick, black, and glutinous. And I have ob&s;erved,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Id ibid.</NOTE> continues he, Blood to flow from Arterys opened in a virulent Cancer, which was fluid, of a fine Red Colour, and in all Ap|pearance,

<P>ALL Attempts therefore to cure Fevers by directly attenuating the Blood; or by correcting, or expel|ling any <HI>morbific Matter</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be in it, mu&s;t be vain, and fruit|le&s;s; ina&s;much as they are levelled, not at the Cau&s;es, but meerly at the Effects of the&s;e Di&s;orders.

<PB N="70" REF="81">
<P>IT now remains to &s;hew, by what Means that Rigor and Con&s;triction of the Surface, from which, we have proved, all the other Symptoms of Fevers ari&s;e, are them&s;elves produced; and the&s;e Means I take to be no o|ther, but tho&s;e very Things which are commonly called the remote Cau|&s;es of the&s;e Di&s;orders; <HI>viz.</HI> Cold tak|en, Exce&s;&s;es in Eating and Drinking, the Suppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome u&s;ual Di&s;|charge, Trouble of Mind, and other Accidents of the like Nature, when great and &s;udden.</P>
<P>FOR, Fir&s;t; as to Gold taken, a Rigor and Con&s;triction of the Surface, and a Fever thence en&s;uing, are &s;uch com|mon and obvious Effects of it, that all Proof on this Head is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>Thus the<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Gal. 11. Meth. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> antient Phi&s;itians gene|rally attributed the Ri&s;e even of pu|trid Fevers, to no other Cau&s;e, but the Ob&s;truction of the Pores of the Skin.</P>
<P>SECONDLY; Exce&s;&s;es in Eating and Drinking are apt to leave Crudities in the Stomach, which, by remaining there for a certain Time, grow acrid, and vellicate its nervous Coate; and from thence a Rigor or Con&s;triction may be propagated, by Con&s;ent, to the Surface of the Body. Of this Con&s;ent of the Stomach with the Skin, we have a plain Proof, in tho&s;e who are apt to &s;hudder after having taken Things that are acrid or &s;ower. And CEL|SUS,
