<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MOST medical gentlemen will, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, agree, that the greater part of the numerous train of di&s;ea&s;es to which their patients are &s;ubject, have been brought on by improper conduct and imprudence. That this conduct often proceeds from ignorance of its bad effects, may be pre|&s;umed; for though it cannot be denied that &s;ome per&s;ons are perfectly regard|le&s;s with re&s;pect to their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">alth, yet
<PB N="ii" REF="5">the great ma&s;s of mankind are too &s;en&s;ible of the enjoyment and lo&s;s of this greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, to run headlong into danger, with their eyes open.</P>
<P>It was with the hope of making the laws of life more generally known, and better under&s;tood, and from thence deduc|ing &s;uch rules for the pre&s;ervation of health, as would be evident to every capacity, that the author was induced to deliver this lecture. It has been honoured with the attention of numerous audiences, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t populous towns in England, where it has generally been read for the benefit of charitable in|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The author flatters him&s;elf, that be|&s;ides the benefit produced by his humble endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;erve the&s;e in&s;titutions, tho&s;e
<PB N="iii" REF="6">endeavours have not totally failed in the grand object of pre&s;erving health; and with the hope that the influence of the precepts here given, may be farther extended, he has concurred in the ideas of tho&s;e who have advi&s;ed the publication of this lecture.</P>
<P>It is to be feared, that notwith&s;tanding all which can be done, di&s;ea&s;e will conti|nue to be a heavy tax, which civilized &s;o|ciety mu&s;t pay for its comforts; and the valetudinarian will often be tempted to envy the &s;avage the &s;trength and &s;oundne&s;s his con&s;titution. Much however may be done towards the prevention of a number of di&s;ea&s;es. If this lecture &s;hould contribute to the attainment of &s;o de&s;irable an end, it will afford the highe&s;t gratification to the author.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the lecture is the &s;ub|&s;tance
<PB N="iv" REF="7">of an e&s;&s;ay which was read by the author before the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh, intended as a defence of the general principles of the &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Brown, who&s;e pupil he then was. It was, according to cu&s;tom, tran&s;cribed into the books of the &s;ociety, and the public have now an opportunity of judging how far Dr. Girtanner, in his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay publi&s;hed in the Journal de Phy&s;ique, about two years after, in which he gives the theory as his own, without the lea&s;t acknowledgement to the much injured and unfortunate author of the <HI>Elementa Medicinae,</HI> has borrowed from this e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>In public lectures, novelty is not to be expected, the principal object of the lectu|rer being to place in a proper point of view, what has been before di&s;covered. The au|thor has therefore freely availed him&s;elf of
<PB N="v" REF="8">the labours of others, particularly of the publications of the philanthropic Dr. Bed|does, which he takes this opportunity of acknowledging.</P>

<HEAD>A LECTURE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy is health, without it, wealth, honors, and every other con&s;ideration, would be in&s;ipid, and even irk&s;ome; the pre&s;ervation of this &s;tate therefore, naturally concerns us all. In this lecture, I &s;hall not attempt to teach you to become your own phy&s;icians, for when the barriers of health are once bro|ken down, and di&s;ea&s;e has e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf, it requires the deepe&s;t attention, and an accurate acquaintance with the exten&s;ive &s;cience of medicine, to combat it; to attain this knowledge demands the labour of years. But, a majority of
<PB N="6" REF="10">the di&s;ea&s;es to which we are &s;ubject, are the effects of our own ignorance or im|prudence, and it is often very ea&s;y to prevent them; mere precepts however, have &s;eldom much effect, unle&s;s the rea|&s;oning upon them be rendered evident; on this account, I &s;hall fir&s;t endeavour, in as plain and ea&s;y a manner as po&s;&s;ible, to explain to you the laws by which life is governed; and when we &s;ee in what health con&s;i&s;ts, we &s;hall be better enabled to take &s;uch methods as may pre&s;erve it. Health is the ea&s;y and plea&s;ant exerci&s;e of all the functions of the body and mind; and di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the unea&s;y and di&s;proportioned exerci&s;e of all, or &s;ome of the functions.</P>
<P>When dead matter acts upon dead matter, the only effects we perceive are mechanical, or chemical; for though there may appear to be other kinds of at|traction, or repul&s;ion, &s;uch as electric and magnetic, yet the&s;e come under the head of mechanical attraction, as pro|ducing
<PB N="7" REF="11">motion; we may therefore lay it down as a law, that when dead, or inanimate bodies act upon each other, no other than mechanical, or chemical ef|fects are produced; that is, either mo|tion, or the decompo&s;ition, and new combination of their parts. If one ball &s;trike another, it communicates to it a certain quantity of motion, this is called mechanical action; and if a quantity of &s;alt, or &s;ugar, be put into water, the par|ticles of the &s;alt or &s;ugar will &s;eparate from each other, and join them&s;elves to the particles of the water; the &s;alt and water in the&s;e in&s;tances, are &s;aid to act on each other chemically; and in all ca&s;es whatever, in which inanimate, or dead bodies act on each other, the effects produced are, motion, or chemical at|traction.</P>
<P>But, when dead matter acts on tho&s;e bodies which we call living, the effects are much different; let us take for ex|ample a very &s;imple in&s;tance.&mdash;Snakes,
<PB N="8" REF="12">at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;pecies of them, pa&s;s the winter in a torpid &s;tate, which has all the appearance of death; now heat, if applied to dead matter, will only pro|duce motion, or chemical combination; but if it be applied to the &s;nake, let us &s;ee what will be the con&s;equence; the reptile fir&s;t begins to move, and opens its eyes and mouth; when the heat has been applied for &s;ome time, it crawls a|bout in &s;earch of food, and performs all the functions of life. Here then, dead matter, when applied to a living body, produces living functions; for if the heat had not been applied, the &s;nake would have continued &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and apparent|ly lifele&s;s. In more perfect animals, the effects produced by the action of dead matter on them, are more numerous, and are different in different living &s;y&s;|tems, but are in general the following&mdash; &s;en&s;e and motion in almo&s;t all animals, and in many the power of thinking, and other affections of the mind. The pow|ers, or dead matters, which are applied,
<PB N="9" REF="13">and which produce the&s;e functions, are chiefly, heat, food, and air. The proof that the&s;e powers do produce the living functions, is in my opinion a very con|vincing one, namely, that when their actions are &s;u&s;pended, the living func|tions cea&s;e; take away, for in&s;tance, heat, air, and food from animals, and they &s;oon become dead matter; and it is not nece&s;&s;ary that an animal &s;hould be deprived of all tho&s;e to put a &s;top to the living functions; if any one of them be taken away, the body &s;ooner or later becomes dead matter: it is found by ex|perience, that if a man be deprived of air, he dies in about three or four mi|nutes; for in&s;tance, if he be immer&s;ed under water, if he be deprived of heat, or in other words, expo&s;ed to a very &s;e|vere degree of cold, he likewi&s;e &s;oon dies; or if he be deprived of food, his death is equally certain, though more &s;low. It is &s;ufficiently evident then, that the living functions are owing to the action of the&s;e external powers upon
<PB N="10" REF="14">the body. What I have here &s;aid, is not confined to animals, but the living functions of vegetables are likewi&s;e cau&s;|ed by the action of dead matter upon them. The dead matters, which by their action produce the&s;e functions, are prin|cipally heat, moi&s;ture, light, and air. It clearly follows therefore, from what I have &s;aid, that living bodies mu&s;t have &s;ome property different from dead matter, which renders them capable of being acted upon by the&s;e external powers, &s;o as to produce the living functions; for if they had not, the only effects which the&s;e powers could produce, would be mecha|nical, or chemical. Though we know not exactly in what this property con|&s;i&s;ts, or in what manner it is acted on, yet we &s;ee, that when bodies are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, they become capable of being acted upon by external powers, and thus the living functions are produced; we &s;hall therefore call this property <HI>excitability,</HI> and in u&s;ing this term it is nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that I mean only to expre&s;s a
<PB N="11" REF="15">fact, without the lea&s;t intention of point|ing out the nature of that property which di&s;tingui&s;hes living from dead matter, and in this we have the example of the great Newton, who called the property which cau&s;es bodies in certain &s;ituations to approach each other, <HI>gravi|tation,</HI> without in the lea&s;t hinting at its nature; yet, though he knew not what gravitation was, he inve&s;tigated the laws by which bodies were acted on by it; in the &s;ame manner, though we are ignorant of excitability, or the nature of that property which di&s;tingui&s;hes liv|ing from dead matter, we can inve&s;ti|gate the laws by which dead matter acts on living bodies through this medium. We know not what magnetic attraction is, and yet we can inve&s;tigate its laws; the &s;ame holds good with regard to elec|tricity; if we ever &s;hould attain a know|ledge of the nature of this property, it would make no alteration in the laws which we had before di&s;covered.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="16">
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the inve&s;tiga|tion of the laws by which the excitability is acted on; but I mu&s;t fir&s;t define &s;ome terms which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e, to avoid circumlocution, and at the &s;ame time to give us more di&s;tinct ideas on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When the excitability is in &s;uch a &s;tate as to be very &s;u&s;ceptible of the action of external powers, I &s;hall call it <HI>abun|dant,</HI> or <HI>accumulated;</HI> but when it is found not very capable of receiving their action, I &s;hall &s;ay, it is <HI>deficient,</HI> or <HI>ex|hau&s;ted.</HI> I would not wi&s;h however, to have it thought, that by the&s;e terms I mean in the lea&s;t to hint at the <HI>nature</HI> of excitability, nor that it is <HI>really</HI> one while increa&s;ed, and at another dimi|ni&s;hed in quantity, for the ab&s;tract que&s;|tion is in no &s;hape con&s;idered; we know not whether the excitability, or the vi|tal principle, depends on a particular ar|rangement of matter, or from whatever cau&s;e it may originate; by the terms
<PB N="13" REF="17">here u&s;ed, I mean only to &s;ay, that the excitability is ea&s;ily acted on when I call it abundant, or accumulated; at other times the living body is with more diffi|culty excited, and then I &s;ay, the vital principle is deficient, or exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The laws by which external powers act on living bodies, will, on a careful examination, be found to be the follow|ing&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, when the powerful action of the exciting powers cea&s;es for &s;ome time, the excitability accumulates, or becomes more capable of receiving their action, and is more powerfully affected by them.</P>
<P>If we examine &s;eparately the differ|ent exciting powers, which act on the body, we &s;hall find abundant confirma|tion of this law. Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider Light; if a per&s;on be kept in darkne&s;s for &s;ome time, and be then brought into a room in which there is only an ordi|nary
<PB N="14" REF="18">degree of light, it will be almo&s;t too oppre&s;&s;ive for him, and appear exce&s;|&s;ively bright; and if he have been kept for a con&s;iderable time in a very dark place, the &s;en&s;ation will be very painful. In this ca&s;e, while the retina, or optic nerve, was deprived of light, its excita|bility accumulated, or became more ea|&s;ily affected by light; for if a per&s;on goes out of one room, into another which has an equal degree of light, he will feel no effect. You may convince your&s;elves of this law by a very &s;imple experiment&mdash;&s;hut your eyes, and cover them for a minute or two with your hand, and endeavour not to think of the light, or of what you are doing; then open them, and the day-light will for a &s;hort time appear brighter. If you look attentively at a window, for about two minutes, and then ca&s;t your eyes upon a &s;heet of white paper, the &s;hape of the window-frames will be perfectly vi&s;ible upon the paper; tho&s;e parts which ex|pre&s;s the wood-work, appearing brighter
<PB N="15" REF="19">than the other parts. The parts of the optic nerve on which the image of the frame falls, are covered by the wood-work from the action of the light; the excitability of the&s;e parts of the nerve will therefore accumulate, and the parts of the paper which fall upon them, mu&s;t of cour&s;e appear brighter. If a per&s;on be brought out of a dark room where he has been confined, into a field covered with &s;now, when the &s;un &s;hines, it has been known to affect him &s;o much, as to deprive him of &s;ight altogether.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider what happens with re&s;pect to heat; if heat be for &s;ome time ab&s;tracted, the excitability accu|mulates, or in other words, if the body be for &s;ome time expo&s;ed to cold, it is more liable to be affected by heat, after|wards applied; of this al&s;o you may be convinced by an ea&s;y experiment&mdash;put one of your hands into cold water, and then put both into water which is con&s;i|derably
<PB N="16" REF="20">warm; the hand which has been in cold water, will feel much warmer than the other. If you handle &s;ome &s;now with one hand, while you keep the other in your bo&s;om, that it may be of the &s;ame heat as the body, then bring both within the &s;ame di&s;|tance of the fire, the heat will affect the cold hand infinitely more than the warm one. This is a circum&s;tance of the utmo&s;t importance, and ought al|ways to be carefully attended to. When a per&s;on has been expo&s;ed to a &s;evere de|gree of cold for &s;ome time, he ought to be cautious how he comes near a fire, for his excitability will be &s;o much accumulated, that the heat will act violently; often producing a great de|gree of inflammation, and even &s;ome|times mortification. We may be the way ob&s;erve, that this is a very com|mon cau&s;e of chilblains, and other in|flammations. When the hands, or any other parts of the body have been ex|po&s;ed to violent cold, they ought fir&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="21">to be put into cold water, or even rubbed with the &s;now, and expo&s;ed to warmth in the gentle&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Exactly the &s;ame takes place with re&s;pect to food, if a per&s;on have for &s;ome time been deprived of food, or have taken it in &s;mall quantity, whether it be meat or drink; or if he have taken it of a le&s;s &s;timulating quality, he will find, that when he returns to his ordinary mode of living, it will have more effect upon him than before he lived ab&s;temiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who have been &s;hut up in a coal-work from the falling in of the pit, and have had nothing to eat for two or three days, have been as much intoxi|cated by a ba&s;on of broth, as a per&s;on in common circum&s;tances with two or three bottles of wine; and we all know that &s;pirituous, or vinous liquors affect the head more in the morning, than after dinner.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="22">
<P>This circum&s;tance was particularly evident among the poor &s;ailors who were in the boat with Captain Bligh after the mutiny. The Captain was &s;ent by government to convey &s;ome plants of the bread-fruit tree from Otaheite, to the We&s;t Indies; &s;oon after he left Otaheite, the crew mutinied, and put the captain and mo&s;t of the officers, with &s;ome of the men, on board the &s;hip's boat, with a very &s;hort allowance of provi&s;ions, and particularly of liquors, for they had only &s;ix quarts of rum, and &s;ix bottles of wine, for nineteen people, who were driven by &s;torms about the &s;outh-&s;ea, ex|po&s;ed to wet and cold all the time, for nearly a month; each man was allowed only a tea-&s;poon full of rum a day, but this tea-&s;poon full refre&s;hed the poor men, benumbed as they were with cold, and faint with hunger, more than twenty times the quantity would have done tho&s;e who were warm, and well fed; and had it not been for the &s;pirit having &s;uch power to act upon men in
<PB N="19" REF="23">their condition, they never could have outlived the hard&s;hips they experienced. All the&s;e facts, and many others which might be brought, e&s;tabli&s;h beyond a doubt the truth of the law I have men|tioned, namely, that when the powerful action of the exciting powers cea&s;es for &s;ome time, the excitability accumulates, or becomes more capable of receiving their actions.</P>
<P>The &s;econd law is, that when the ex|citing powers have acted with violence, or for a con&s;iderable time, the excitabi|lity becomes exhau&s;ted, or le&s;s fit to be acted on, and this we &s;hall be able to prove by a &s;imilar induction. Let us take the effects of light upon the eye; when it has acted violently for &s;ome time upon the optic nerve, it dimini&s;hes the excitability of that nerve, and renders it incapable of being affected by a quan|tity of light that would at other times affect it. When you have been walk|ing out in the &s;now, if you come into
<PB N="20" REF="24">your room, you will be &s;carcely able to &s;ee any thing for &s;ome minutes. Look &s;tedfa&s;tly at a candle for a minute or two, and you will with difficulty di&s;cern the letters of a book, which you were before reading di&s;tinctly; and if you hap|pen to ca&s;t your eyes upon the &s;un, you will not &s;ee any thing du&s;tinctly for &s;ome time afterwards.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider the matter of heat: &s;uppo&s;e water to be heated luke|warm, if you put one hand into it, it will feel warm; if you now put the other hand into water, heated for in&s;tance to 120&deg; or 130&deg;, and keep it there &s;ome time, we will &s;ay, two minutes, if then you take it out, and put it into the luke-warm water, that water will feel cold, though &s;till it will &s;eem warm to the other hand; for, the hand which had been in the heated water, has had its excitability exhau&s;ted by the application of heat. Before you go into a warm bath, the temperature of the air may
<PB N="21" REF="25">&s;eem warm and agreeable to you, but after you have remained for &s;ome time in a bath that is rather hot, when you come out, you feel the air uncommonly cool and chilling.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the effects of &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach; and as the effects of &s;pirituous, and vinous li|quors, are a little more remarkable than food, we &s;hall make our ob&s;ervations upon them.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who is unaccu&s;tomed to drink the&s;e liquors, will be intoxicated by a quantity that will produce no effect upon one who has been &s;ome time ac|cu&s;tomed to take them; and when a per&s;on has u&s;ed him&s;elf to the&s;e &s;timu|lants for &s;ome time, the ordinary pow|ers which in common &s;upport life, will not have their proper effects upon him, becau&s;e his excitability has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure exhau&s;ted by the &s;timulants.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="26">
<P>The &s;ame holds good with re&s;pect to tobacco and opium; a per&s;on accu&s;tom|ed to take opium will not be affected by a quantity that would completely intoxi|cate one not u&s;ed to it; becau&s;e the excitability has been &s;o far exhau&s;ted by the u&s;e of that drug, that it cannot be acted on by a &s;mall quantity.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, with innumerable others, which will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to you, prove the truth of our &s;econd pro|po&s;ition, namely, that when the exciting powers have acted violently, or for a con&s;iderable time, the excitability is ex|hau&s;ted, or le&s;s fit to be acted on.</P>
<P>This exhau&s;tion of the excitability, may, however, be either finite, or tem|porary; we &s;ee animals, while the ex|citing powers continue to act, at fir&s;t appear in their greate&s;t vigour, then gradually decay, and at la&s;t come into that &s;tate, in which, from the long continued action of the exciting powers,
<PB N="23" REF="27">the excitability is entirely exhau&s;ted, and death takes place.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e &s;ee plants in the &s;pring, while the exciting powers have acted on them, moderately, and for a &s;hort time, arrayed in their verdant robes, and adorned with flowers of "many mingling hues;" but, as the exciting powers which &s;upport the life of the plant, continue to be ap|plied, and &s;ome of them, for in&s;tance heat, as the &s;ummer advances become increa&s;|ed, they fir&s;t loo&s;e their verdure, then grow brown, and at the end of &s;ummer cea&s;e to live; becau&s;e their excitability is exhau&s;ted by the long continued action of the exciting powers; and this does not happen merely in con&s;equence of the heat of &s;ummer decrea&s;ing, for they grow brown and die, even in a greater degree of heat than that which in &s;pring made them grow luxuriantly.</P>
<P>The&s;e are examples of the finite, or irreparable exhau&s;tion of the excitability;
<PB N="24" REF="28">but we find al&s;o, that it may be ex|hau&s;ted for a time, and accumulated a|gain. Though the eye has been &s;o daz|zled by the &s;plendour of light, that it cannot &s;ee an object moderately illumi|nated, yet, if it be &s;hut for &s;ome time, the excitability of the optic nerve accu|mulates again, and we are again capable of &s;eeing with an ordinary light.</P>
<P>We find, that we are not always equal|ly capable of performing the functions of life. When we have been engaged in any exertion, either mental or corporeal, for &s;ome hours only, we find our&s;elves fatigued, and unfit to pur&s;ue our labours much longer; if in this &s;tate, &s;everal of the exciting powers, particularly light and noi&s;e, be withdrawn; and if we are laid in a po&s;ture which does not require much mu&s;cular exertion, we &s;oon fall into that &s;tate which nature intended for the accumulation of the ex|citability, and which we call &s;leep. In this &s;tate, many of the exciting powers

<P>From the internal &s;en&s;ations often ex|cited, it is natural to conclude that the nerves of &s;en&s;e are not torpid during &s;leep; but that they are only precluded from the perception of external objects, by the external organs being rendered unfit to tran&s;mit to them the impul&s;es of bodies, during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the power of volition; thus, the eye-lids are clo&s;ed in &s;leep, to prevent the im|pul&s;e of the light from acting on the op|tic nerve; and it is very probable that the drum of the ear is not &s;tretched; it is likewi&s;e probable that &s;omething &s;imilar happens to the external appara|tus of all our organs of &s;en&s;e, which may make them unfit for their office of perception during &s;leep.</P>
<P>The more violently the exciting pow|ers have acted, the &s;ooner is &s;leep brought
<PB N="27" REF="31">on; becau&s;e the excitability is &s;ooner exhau&s;ted, and therefore, &s;ooner re|quires the means of renewing it; and on the contrary, the more weakly the exciting powers have acted, the le&s;s is a per&s;on inclined to &s;leep. In&s;tances of the fir&s;t are, exce&s;s of exerci&s;e, &s;trong liquors, or &s;tudy; and of the latter, an under proportion of the&s;e.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who has been daily accu&s;|tomed to much exerci&s;e, whether men|tal or corporeal, if he omit it, will find little or no inclination to &s;leep; he may however be made to &s;leep by taking a little diffu&s;ible &s;timulus; for in&s;tance, a little warm punch, or opium; which act entirely by exhau&s;ting the excitability to that degree which is com|patible with &s;leep; and when the &s;timu|lant effect of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances is over, the per&s;on &s;oon falls into that &s;tate.</P>
<P>But though the excitability may have
<PB N="28" REF="32">been &s;ufficiently exhau&s;ted, and the ac|tion of the external powers con&s;iderably moderated, yet there are &s;ome things within our&s;elves, which &s;timulate vio|lently, and prevent &s;leep, &s;uch as pain, thir&s;t, and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and emo|tions of the mind. The&s;e all tend to drive away &s;leep, but it may be induced, by withdrawing the mind from the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; particularly from unea&s;y emotions, and employing it on &s;omething which makes a le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion; &s;leep, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is frequently brought on by li&s;tening to the humming of bees, or the murmuring of a rivulet; by em|ploying the mind on &s;ubjects which do not require much exertion, nor produce too much commotion; &s;uch as count|ing to a thou&s;and, or counting drops of water which fall &s;lowly.</P>

<P>By induction we have di&s;covered two of the principal laws by which living bodies are governed; the fir&s;t is, that when the ordinary powers which &s;up|port life have been &s;u&s;pended, or their action le&s;&s;ened for a time, the excitability, or vital principle accumulates, or becomes more fit to receive their actions; and &s;econdly, when the&s;e powers have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="30" REF="34">acted upon violently, or for a con&s;idera|ble time, the excitability is exhau&s;ted, or becomes le&s;s fit to receive their ac|tions. There are therefore three &s;tates in which living bodies exi&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a &s;tate of accumulated excita|bility.</P>
<P>Second, a &s;tate of exhau&s;ted excitabi|lity.</P>
<P>Third, when it is in &s;uch a &s;tate as to produce the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t healthy actions, when acted upon by the exter|nal powers.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, it mu&s;t ap|pear, that life is a forced &s;tate, depend|ing on the action of external powers upon the excitability; and that, by their continued action, if they are properly regulated, the excitability will be gra|dually and in&s;en&s;ibly exhau&s;ted; and life will be re&s;igned into the hands of
<PB N="31" REF="35">him who gave it, without a &s;truggle, and without a groan.</P>
<P>We &s;ee then, that that nature operates in &s;upporting the living part of the crea|tion, by laws as &s;imple and beautiful as tho&s;e by which the inanimate world is governed. In the latter we &s;ee the or|der and harmony which is ob&s;erved by the planets, and their &s;atellities, in their revolution round the great &s;ource of heat and light.</P>

<P>Life then, or tho&s;e functions which we call living, are the effects of certain exciting powers, acting on the excita|bility, or property di&s;tingui&s;hing living from dead matter. When tho&s;e effects, namely, the functions, flow ea&s;ily, plea|&s;antly, and compleatly, from the action of the exciting powers, they indicate that &s;tate which we call Health.</P>
<P>I have detained you a long time on this &s;ubject, but it is of importance to make you acquainted with the&s;e laws; for it is from a knowledge of them, that the rules for pre&s;erving health mu&s;t be deduced; and having rendered them, as I hope, intelligible to you, I &s;hall pro|ceed to point out &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary cautions for our conduct, as are ea&s;ily deduced
<PB N="33" REF="37">from them; and which, experience con|firms; and I &s;hall follow an arrange|ment in the con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, which naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us. The chief exciting powers which act upon us are, air and food; the&s;e I &s;hall re&s;pectively con&s;ider, and afterwards make a few remarks on exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The air is the main-&s;pring in the a|nimal machine; the &s;ource of heat and activity, without which our blood would &s;oon become a black and &s;tagnant ma&s;s, and life would &s;oon &s;top.</P>
<P>It is now known, that only a part of atmo&s;pheric air, is nece&s;&s;ary for re&s;pira|tion: the atmo&s;phere near the &s;urface of the earth, con&s;i&s;ts of two kinds of air; one, which is highly proper for re&s;pira|tion, and combu&s;tion, and in which, an animal immer&s;ed, will live much longer than in the &s;ame quantity of common air; and one, which is perfectly impro|per
<PB N="34" REF="38">for &s;upporting re&s;piration, or com|bu&s;tion for an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e airs, has been called vital air, from its property of &s;upporting life, and con&s;titutes about one fourth of the atmo&s;phere.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oxygen gas, according to the new Nomenclature.</NOTE> The other, from its property of de&s;troying life, is called azote, and forms of cour&s;e the remain|ing three fourths of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The&s;e two airs may be &s;eparated from each other by various methods. If a candle be inclo&s;ed in a given quantity of atmo&s;pheric air, it will burn only for a certain time, and then be extingui&s;hed; and from the ri&s;ing up of the water in the ve&s;&s;el in which it is inclo&s;ed, it is evident that a quantity of air has been ab&s;orbed. What has been ab&s;orbed is the vital air, and what remains, the a|zote; which is incapable of &s;upporting
<PB N="35" REF="39">flame. If an animal be immer&s;ed in a given quantity of common air, it will only live a certain time; at the end of this time, the air will be found dimini&s;h|ed, about one fourth being extracted from it, and the remainder will neither &s;upport flame nor animal life; this expe|riment might ea&s;ily be made, but it &s;eems a piece of unnece&s;&s;ary cruelty.</P>
<P>By &s;imilar experiments to tho&s;e I have mentioned, we get the azote pure; here is &s;ome, in which a candle has burnt out, and in which nothing but azote, or the impure part of the atmo&s;phere is left<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, formed dur|ing the combu&s;tion, having been &s;eparated by agitation in contact with lime water.</NOTE>. I &s;hall plunge a lighted match into it, and you &s;ee it is in&s;tantly extin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Many metals, and particularly man|gane&s;e, when expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;|phere,
<PB N="36" REF="40">attract the vital air from it, without touching the azote; and it may be procured from the&s;e metals by the application of heat, in very great purity. Here is a bottle of that kind of air, which I have expelled by heat from mangane&s;e; I &s;hall plunge a taper into it, and you will perceive that it burns with great brilliancy. An animal &s;hut up in it, would live about four times as long as if &s;hut up in an equal quantity of at|mo&s;pheric air.</P>
<P>If I take three parts of azote, and one of vital air, I &s;hall form a compound which is &s;imilar to the atmo&s;phere, and which is the mixture be&s;t &s;uited to &s;up|port the health of the body; for if there were a much greater proportion of vital air, it would act too powerfully upon the &s;y&s;tem, and bring on inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es; it would likewi&s;e by its &s;timu|lus exhau&s;t the excitability, and bring us &s;ooner to death; and in the &s;ame manner that a candle burns brighter in
<PB N="37" REF="41">vital air, and would therefore be &s;ooner extingui&s;hed, &s;o would the flame of life be &s;ooner burnt out.</P>
<P>On the contrary, if the atmo&s;phere contained a much le&s;s proportion of vital air, it would not &s;timulate the body &s;uf|ficiently; the excitability would mor|bidly accumulate, and di&s;ea&s;es of debility would occur.</P>
<P>Combu&s;tion, putrefaction, and the breathing of animals, are proce&s;&s;es which are continually dimini&s;hing the quantity of vital air contained in the atmo&s;phere; and if the all-wi&s;e author of nature had not provided for its continual re-produc|tion, the atmo&s;phere would in all proba|bility have long &s;ince become too impure to &s;upport life; but this is guarded a|gain&s;t in a mo&s;t beautiful manner.</P>
<P>Water is not a &s;imple element, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed, but is compo&s;ed of vital air, and a particular kind of air which
<PB N="38" REF="42">is called inflammable; the &s;ame that is u&s;ed to fill balloons. It has been found by experiment, than one hundred pounds of water, are compo&s;ed of eighty-five pounds of vital-air, and fifteen of inflammable air.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strictly &s;peaking, water is compo&s;ed of the ba&s;es of the&s;e airs, the greate&s;t part of the caloric being given out on their union.</NOTE></P>
<P>Water may be decompounded by a variety of means, and its component parts &s;eparated from each other.</P>
<P>Vegetables effect this decompo&s;ition; they ab&s;orb water, and decompo&s;e it in their glands; and taking the inflamma|ble air for their nouri&s;hment, breathe out the vital air in a &s;tate of very great purity; this may be a&s;certained by a ve|ry ea&s;y experiment.</P>
<P>This vital air is received by animals into their lungs, gives them their
<PB N="39" REF="43">heat, and communicates a red colour to their blood; when animals die for want of vital air, their blood is always found black.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, it is evident, that in large and populous towns, where combu&s;tion and re&s;piration are continu|ally performed on a large &s;cale, the air mu&s;t be much le&s;s pure than in the country, where there are few of the&s;e cau&s;es to contaminate the atmo&s;phere, and where vegetables are continually tending to render it more pure; and if it was not for the winds which agitate this element, and continually occa&s;ion its change of place; the air of large towns would probably &s;oon become unfit for re&s;piration. Winds bring us the pure air of the country, and take away that from which the vital air has been in a great mea&s;ure extracted; but &s;till, from the immen&s;e quantity of fuel which is daily burnt, and the number of people
<PB N="40" REF="44">breathing in large towns, the air very &s;oon becomes impure.</P>
<P>From the greater purity of the air in the country, proceeds the ro&s;y bloom found in the rural cottage, which we in vain look for in the &s;tately palace, or the &s;plendid drawing room. Here then are rea&s;ons for preferring the country, which no one will di&s;pute; and when|ever it can be done, &s;uch a &s;ituation ought always to be cho&s;en in preference to a large town; this cannot be better enforced than in the words of Dr. Arm|&s;trong.&mdash;</P>

<P>But there are many who&s;e occupations oblige them to re&s;ide in large towns; they, therefore &s;hould make frequent excur&s;ions into the country, or to &s;uch &s;ituations as will enable them to enjoy, and to breathe air of a little more purity. I &s;ay <HI>enjoy,</HI> for who that has been for &s;ome time &s;hut up in the town, without breathing the pure air of the country, does not feel his &s;pirits revived the mo|ment he emerges from the azote of the town.

<P>Large towns are the graves of the hu|man &s;pecies; they would peri&s;h in a few generations, if not con&s;tantly re|cruited from the country. The confin|ed, putrid air, which mo&s;t of their inha|bitants breathe, their want of natural exerci&s;e, but above all their di&s;&s;ipation, &s;horten their lives, and ruin their con&s;ti|tutions.</P>
<P>Children particularly, require a pure air, every circum&s;tance points out the country as the proper place for the edu|cation of children; the purity of the air, the variety of ru&s;tic &s;ports, the plainne&s;s of diet, the &s;implicity and in|nocence of manners, all concur to re|commend it. It is a melancholy fact,
<PB N="43" REF="47">that above half the children born in Lon|don, die before they are two years old.</P>
<P>To &s;hew how indi&s;pen&s;able fre&s;h air is to children, I &s;hall mention one ex|ample which &s;ets the fact in the cleare&s;t light. In the lying-in ho&s;pital at Dub|lin, 2944 infants, out of 7650, died in the year 1782, within the fir&s;t fortnight after their birth, which is nearly every third child; they almo&s;t all died in con|vul&s;ions; many of them foamed at the mouth, their thumbs were drawn into the palms of their hands, their jaws were locked, the face was &s;welled and looked blue, as though they were choak|ed. This la&s;t circum&s;tance led the phy|&s;icians to conclude that the rooms in the ho&s;pital were too clo&s;e, and hence, that the infants had not a &s;ufficient quantity of good air to breathe; they therefore &s;et about ventilating them better, which was done very compleatly. The con|&s;equence has been, that not one child dies now where three u&s;ed to die.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="48">
<P>Fewer children indeed die convul&s;ed now, than formerly; this is becau&s;e the rich learn, either from books, or con|ver&s;ation with phy&s;icians, how nece&s;&s;a|ry fre&s;h air is to life and health; hence they keep their hou&s;es well aired; but the poor, and &s;ervants, are not made to comprehend this matter properly; and therefore from neglecting to open their windows, and breathing a foul, tainted air, the greate&s;t part of their time, many di&s;orders are brought on, and others rendered wor&s;e than they naturally would be.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where manufactures are carried on to a great ex|tent, the air is rendered &s;till wor&s;e, and every precau|tion ought to be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the health of the in|habitants.

Night working is undoubtedly a perver&s;ion of the laws of nature, renders the con&s;titution feeble, and lays a foundation for bad health and di&s;ea&s;e: for it not only gives no time for ventilation, and in con&s;equence the quantity of oxygen becomes more and more ex|hau&s;ted, but the number of candles u&s;ed, contributes very much to contaminate the air. It has been found by experiment that a candle contaminates more air than a man. By per&s;ons who are intere&s;ted in the welfare of the &s;ucceeding generation, night-work will never be urged, and it will be right to ventilate the manufac|tories every night, as well as during breakfa&s;t and dinner.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="45" REF="49">
<P>Having con&s;idered the purity of the air, let us next take a view of the changes in temperature which it undergoes, and the effects which the&s;e have upon the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>We find the air &s;ometimes con&s;iderably below the freezing point; nay, even &s;o much as 20 or 30 degrees; it is then inten&s;ely cold; and on the other hand, it &s;ometimes ri&s;es to a great degree of heat. We then find our&s;elves much re|laxed, and our con&s;titutions exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand how this happens, let us con&s;ider for a moment the nature of heat, and cold.&mdash;Heat is one of tho&s;e &s;timuli which act upon the excitability,
<PB N="44" REF="50">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="45" REF="51">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="46" REF="52">and &s;upport life: for if it was totally withdrawn, we &s;hould not be able to exi&s;t even a few minutes; and cold, is only a diminution of heat. When heat is pre|&s;ent, in a proper degree, or the atmo&s;|phere is about that degree of heat which we call temperate, it ju&s;t gives &s;uch a degree of &s;timulus, and keeps the excita|bility exhau&s;ted to &s;uch a degree, as to pre&s;erve the body in health; but if it continue for a con&s;iderable time to be much warmer than this temperature, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be, from the laws al|ready laid down, an exhau&s;tion of the excitability, and a con&s;equent relaxation and debility; for, when the excitability has been exhau&s;ted by the violent applica|tion of heat, long continued, the com|mon &s;timulant powers which &s;upport life, cannot produce a &s;ufficient effect upon it, to give to the body that tone which is compatible with health. On the contrary, when the heat of the air falls below what we call temperate, or when cold is applied to the body, from
<PB N="47" REF="53">the accu&s;tomed &s;timulus of heat being dimini&s;hed, the excitability mu&s;t accu|mulate, or become more liable to be af|fected by the action of the external powers.</P>
<P>This, however, very &s;eldom produces bad effects, unle&s;s the exciting powers be improperly or quickly applied; for we can bear a con&s;iderable diminution of heat without any bad con&s;equences; and in all ca&s;es I hope I &s;hall be able to make it ap|pear, that much more mi&s;chief ari&s;es from the too great action of heat, than from the diminution of it. Nature never made any country too cold for its inhabitants. In cold climates, &s;he has made exerci&s;e, and even fatigue habitual to them, not only from the nece&s;&s;ity of their &s;ituation, but from choice, their natural diver&s;ions be|ing all of the athletic or violent kind. But the &s;oftne&s;s and effeminacy of mo|dern manners, has both deprived us of our natural defence again&s;t the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t incident to our climate, and &s;ub|jected
<PB N="48" REF="54">us to all the inconveniencies of a warm one.</P>
<P>People are afraid of going out into the cold air; but if they conduct them&s;elves properly afterwards, they will never be in the lea&s;t danger from it. Indeed the action of cold, unle&s;s it be exce&s;&s;ive, never produces any bad effects.</P>
<P>Many of you will, no doubt, think me here in an error; but I hope you will not long entertain that opinion. You will &s;ay that you have had frequent ex|perience to the contrary; that you have often gone out into the cold air, and have caught dreadful colds. That this is owing to the action of cold, I will deny; nay, I will a&s;&s;ert, that if a per|&s;on go out into air which is very cold, <HI>and remain in it</HI> for a very long time, he will never perceive any &s;ymptoms of what is called a cold &s;o long as he re|mains there.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="55">
<P>A common cold is attended with a running of the no&s;e, hoar&s;ene&s;s, and cough, with a con&s;iderable degree of fe|veri&s;h heat, and dryne&s;s of the &s;kin.&mdash; Now it is univer&s;ally agreed, that this di&s;order is an inflammation, or is of an inflammatory nature; it is an inflamma|tion of the &s;mooth, moi&s;t &s;kin which lines the no&s;trils, and goes down the wind-pipe into the lungs; but as cold is only a diminution of heat, or a dimi|nution of a &s;timulus acting upon the bo|dy, it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a diminu|tion can cau&s;e a greater action or excite|ment; we might as well expect to fill a ve&s;&s;el by taking water out of it. But let us &s;ee how a cold, as it is commonly called, is u&s;ually produced. When a per&s;on in cold weather goes out into the air, every time he draws in his breath, the cold air pa&s;&s;es through his no&s;trils and windpipe into the lungs, and in thus dimini&s;hing the heat of the parts, allows their excitability to accumulate, and renders them more liable to be affected by
<PB N="50" REF="56">the &s;ucceeding heat. So long as that per&s;on continues in the cold air, he feels no bad effects; but if he come into a warm room, he fir&s;t perceives a glow within his no&s;trils and brea&s;t, as well as all over the &s;urface of the body. Soon afterwards, a di&s;agreeable dryne&s;s and hu&s;kine&s;s will be felt in the no&s;trils and brea&s;t. By and by a &s;hort, dry, tickling cough comes on. He feels a &s;hivering, which makes him draw nearer to the fire, but all to no purpo&s;e; the more he tries to heat him&s;elf, the more chill he be|comes. All the mi&s;chief is here cau&s;ed by the violent action of the heat on the accumulated excitability. For want of a knowledge of this law, the&s;e di&s;agree|able, and often dangerous complaints are brought on; when they might be avoid|ed with the greate&s;t ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When you take a ride into the coun|try on a cold day, you find your&s;elves very cold; as &s;oon as you go into a hou&s;e, you are invited to come to the fire, and
<PB N="51" REF="57">warm your&s;elves; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, to drink &s;omething warm and comfortable, to keep out the cold, as the &s;aying is. The inevitable con&s;equence of this, is, to bring on the complaints which I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed, which might with more propriety, be called heats than colds. But how ea&s;ily might the&s;e complaints have been avoided! When you come out of a very cold atmo&s;phere, you &s;hould not at fir&s;t go into a room that has a fire in it, or if you cannot avoid that, you &s;hould keep for a con&s;i|derable time at as great a di&s;tance from the fire as po&s;&s;ible, that the accumulated excitability may be gradually exhau&s;ted, by the moderate and gentle action of heat; and then you may bear the heat of the fire without any danger: but, above all, refrain from taking warm or &s;trong liquors while you are cold. If a per&s;on have his hands or feet expo&s;ed to a very &s;evere cold, the excitability of tho&s;e parts will be &s;o much accumulated, that if they &s;hould be brought &s;uddenly
<PB N="52" REF="58">near the fire, a violent inflammation, and even a mortification will take place, which has often happened; or, at any rate, that inflammation called Chilblains will be produced, from the violent ac|tion of the heat upon the accumulated ex|citability of tho&s;e parts; but, if a per&s;on &s;o circum&s;tanced, was to put his hands or feet into cold water, very little warmer than the atmo&s;phere to which he had been expo&s;ed, or rub them with &s;now, which is not often colder than 32 or 30 degrees, the morbid excitability will be gradually exhau&s;ted, and no bad con&s;e|quences will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>When a part of the body only has been expo&s;ed to the action of cold, and the re&s;t kept heated, if, for in&s;tance, a per&s;on in a warm room &s;its &s;o that a current of air coming through a broken pane, &s;hould fall upon any part of the body, that part would be &s;oon affected with an inflam|mation, which is u&s;ually called a rheuma|tic inflammation.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="59">
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it will be ea&s;y to account for this circum&s;tance. The excitability of the part is accumu|lated by the diminution of its heat; but at the &s;ame time, the re&s;t of the body and blood is warm; and this warm blood acting upon a part where the excitability is accumulated, will cau&s;e an inflamma|tion; to which, the more you apply heat, the wor&s;e you make it.&mdash;From the&s;e con&s;iderations, we may lay it down as a fact, and experience &s;upports us in &s;o doing, that you may in general go out of warm into cold air without much dan|ger; but, that you can never return &s;uddenly from the cold into the warm air with perfect impunity.</P>
<P>Hence, we may lay down the follow|ing rule, which, if &s;trictly ob&s;erved, would prevent the frequent colds we meet with in winter. <HI>When the whole body, or any part of it, is chilled, bring it to its natural feeling and warmth by degrees.</HI></P>
<PB N="54" REF="60">
<P>But if, for want of ob&s;erving this ne|ce&s;&s;ary caution, a cold, as it is called, &s;hould have &s;eized a per&s;on, let us con|&s;ider what is proper to be done.</P>
<P>It will, from the preceding rea&s;oning, appear very improper to make the room where you &s;it warmer than u&s;ual, to en|crea&s;e the quantity of bed-cloaths, to wrap your&s;elf up in flannel, or particu|larly to drink a large quantity of barley|water, gruel, or tea, almo&s;t boiling hot, by way of diluting, as it is called, and forcing a per&s;piration; this will infalliably make the di&s;order wor&s;e, in the &s;ame manner as confining inoculated per&s;ons in warm rooms would make their &s;mall-pox more violent.</P>
<P>Perhaps there would be &s;carcely &s;uch a thing as a bad cold, if people, when they found it coming on, were to keep cool, and avoid wine and &s;trong liquors, and confine them&s;elves for a &s;hort time to a &s;imple diet of vegetable food, drink|ing
<PB N="55" REF="61">only toa&s;t and water. In&s;tances are by no means uncommon, where a heat of the no&s;trils, difficulty of breathing, a &s;hort, tickling cough, and other &s;ymp|toms, threatening a violent cold, have gone off entirely in con&s;equence of this plan being pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Colds would be much le&s;s frequent, were we to take more pains to accom|modate our dre&s;s to the &s;ea&s;on: if we were warmly cloathed in cold weather, our excitability would not be accumu|lated by the action of the cold. If a greater proportion of females fall victims to this di&s;ea&s;e, is it not becau&s;e, lo&s;ing &s;ight, more than men, of its primary purpo&s;e, they regulate their dre&s;s &s;olely by fan|ta&s;tic ideas of elegance? If happily, as is ob&s;erved by Dr. Beddoes, our regret &s;hould recall the age of chivalry, to break the &s;pell of fa&s;hion would be an atchieve|ment worthy the mo&s;t gallant of our fu|ture Knights. Common &s;en&s;e has al|ways failed in the adventure; and our
<PB N="56" REF="62">ladies, alas! are &s;till compelled, when|ever the enchantre&s;s waves her wand, to expo&s;e them&s;elves half undre&s;&s;ed, to the fogs and fro&s;ts of our i&s;land.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the effects of the air, we ought by no means to be indifferent with regard to what we take into the &s;tomach as food and drink; &s;ince the&s;e have even a greater influence on our health, than the circum&s;tances I have already mentioned. Among the cau&s;es which excite the body, and &s;upport life, I have formerly menti|oned food, or the matters taken into the &s;tomach. It is from the&s;e matters that all the animal &s;olids and fluids are formed; the&s;e are &s;timuli, which if totally with|drawn, we could not exi&s;t many days. The&s;e &s;timuli are &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws with all the others which act upon the body. When they act properly in con|cert with the other powers, they produce the healthy &s;tate; but if they act in an undue degree, whether that action be too great or too little, di&s;ea&s;e will be the
<PB N="57" REF="63">con&s;equence. When they act too feebly, the excitability will accumulate; and di&s;|ea&s;es of debility, attended with a very great degree of irritability, will take place: this has been in&s;tanced in tho&s;e who have been without food for &s;ome time. Per&s;ons who have been &s;hut up in a coal-work by the falling-in of the pit, and have con&s;equently been without food for &s;ome days, have had their ex|citability &s;o much accumulated, as to be toxicated with a ba&s;on of broth.</P>
<P>To this &s;ource we may attribute many of the di&s;ea&s;es with which the poor are afflicted; but they are by no means &s;o common as di&s;ea&s;es of an oppo&s;ite nature, which ari&s;e from a too free u&s;e of food. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf here to the con&s;i|deration of what is more &s;trictly called food, and afterwards con&s;ider the effects of &s;trong liquors.</P>
<P>When we take food in too great quan|tity, or of too nouri&s;hing a quality, it
<PB N="58" REF="64">will either produce inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as pleuri&s;y, or by exhau&s;ting the excitability, it will bring on &s;tomach complaints, gout, and all the &s;ymptoms of premature old age. This follows &s;o evidently from the laws we have inve&s;ti|gated, that it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more on the &s;ubject; and I am &s;ure there are few who have not &s;een examples of it.</P>
<P>Be therefore temperate in eating, and eat only of &s;uch foods as are the plaine&s;t; and let a proper quantity of vegetable food be mixed with animal. If you value the pre&s;ervation of health, never &s;atiate your&s;elves with eating; but let it be a rule from which you ought never to depart, always to ri&s;e from table with &s;ome remains of appetite: for, when the &s;tomach is loaded with more food than it can ea&s;ily dige&s;t, a crude and una&s;&s;i|milated chyle is taken into the blood, pregnant with di&s;ea&s;es. Nor is the quan|tity the only object of attention; the
<PB N="59" REF="65">quality of the food is to be carefully &s;tu|died; made di&s;hes, enriched with hot &s;auces, &s;timulate infinitely more than plain food, and therefore exhau&s;t the ex|citability, bringing on di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility; &s;uch as the wor&s;t kind of gout, apoplexy, and paralytic complaints. "For my part," &s;ays an elegant writer, "when I behold a fa&s;hionable table &s;et out in all its magnificence, I fancy that I &s;ee gouts and drop&s;ies, fevers and lethargies, with other innumerable di&s;tempers, lying in ambu&s;cade among the di&s;hes." Let it be therefore laid down as a rule by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to pre&s;erve their health, and I have nothing to &s;ay to tho&s;e who are in|different on that head, to make their chief repa&s;t on one plain di&s;h, and trifle with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is by no means uncommon for a medical man to have patients, chiefly among people of fa&s;hion and fortune, who complain of being hot and re&s;tle&s;s all night, and having a foul ta&s;te in the
<PB N="60" REF="66">mouth every morning: on examination it is found, that in nineteen ca&s;es out of twenty, it has ari&s;en from their having overloaded their &s;tomachs, and at the &s;ame time neglected to take proper exer|ci&s;e; for it mu&s;t always be ob&s;erved, that more may be eaten with &s;afety, nay, more is even nece&s;&s;ary, when a per&s;on takes a good deal of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>When people take little exerci&s;e, and overload their &s;tomachs, there lies within them a fermenting ma&s;s of undige&s;ted aliment; and it is not &s;urprizing that this &s;hould irritate and heat the body during the night. This is likewi&s;e the foundation of &s;tomach complaints, flatu|lencies, and all other &s;ymptoms of indi|ge&s;tion; which more frequently proceed from intemperance in eating and drink|ing than any other cau&s;e. The benefits ari&s;ing from temperance are &s;et in a &s;triking light in the following allegory, which may be found in the adventurer.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="67">
<P>E&s;culapius, after his deification or ad|mittance among the Gods, having re|vi&s;ited his native country, and being one day (as curio&s;ity led him a rambling,) in danger of being benighted, made the be&s;t of his way to a hou&s;e he &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance, where he was ho&s;pitably re|ceived by the ma&s;ter of it. Cremes, for that was the ma&s;ter's name, though but a young man, was infirm and &s;ickly. Of &s;everal di&s;hes &s;erved up to &s;upper, Cremes ob&s;erved that his gue&s;t ate but of one, and that the mo&s;t &s;imple; nor could all his intreaties prevail upon him to do otherwi&s;e. He was, notwith|&s;tanding, highly delighted with E&s;cula|pius's conver&s;ation, in which he ob&s;erved a cheerfulne&s;s and knowledge &s;uperior to any thing he had hitherto met with.</P>
<P>The next morning, E&s;culapius took his leave, but not till he had engaged his good-natured ho&s;t to pay him a vi&s;it at a &s;mall villa, a few miles from thence. Cremes came accordingly, and was mo&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="68">kindly received; but how great was his amazement when &s;upper was &s;erved up, to &s;ee nothing but milk, honey, and a few roots, dre&s;&s;ed in the plaine&s;t, but neate&s;t manner, to which hunger, cheer|fulne&s;s, and good &s;en&s;e, were the only &s;auces. E&s;culapius &s;eemed to eat with plea&s;ure, while Cremes &s;carcely ta&s;ted of them. On which a repa&s;t was ordered more &s;uitable to the ta&s;te of our gue&s;t. Im|mediately there &s;ucceeded a banquet com|po&s;ed of the mo&s;t artful di&s;hes that luxury could invent, with great plenty and va|riety of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t intoxicating wines. The&s;e too were accompanied by dam&s;els of the mo&s;t bewitching beauty. Cremes now gave a loo&s;e to his appetites, and every thing he ta&s;ted rai&s;ed ex&s;ta&s;ies beyond what he had ever known. During the repa&s;t, the dam&s;els &s;ung and danced to entertain them; their charms enchanted the enraptured gue&s;t, already flu&s;hed with what he had drank; his &s;en&s;es were lo&s;t in ex&s;tatic confu&s;ion. Every thing around him &s;eemed Ely&s;ium,
<PB N="63" REF="69">and he was on the point of indulging the mo&s;t boundle&s;s freedoms, when on a &s;udden their beauty, which was but a vizard, fell off, and di&s;covered forms the mo&s;t hideous and forbidding imagi|nable. Lu&s;t, revenge, folly, murder, meagre poverty, and de&s;pair, now ap|peared in the mo&s;t odious &s;hapes, and the place in&s;tantly became a mo&s;t dire &s;cene of mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion. How often did Cremes wi&s;h him&s;elf far di&s;tant from &s;uch a diabolical company, and now dreaded the fatal con&s;equence which threatened him. His blood ran chill at his heart, and joy and rapture were per|verted to amazement and horror!&mdash; When E&s;culapius perceived it had made a &s;ufficient impre&s;&s;ion on his gue&s;t, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him: "Know, Cremes, it is E&s;culapius who has thus entertained you, and what you have beheld is a true image of the deceitfulne&s;s and mi&s;ery in&s;eparable from luxury and intempe|rance. Would you be happy, be tem|perate: temperance is the parent of
<PB N="64" REF="70">health, virtue, wi&s;dom, plenty, and every thing that can make you happy in this or the world to come. It is indeed the true luxury of life, for without it life cannot be enjoyed." This &s;aid, he di&s;appeared, and left Cremes (in&s;tead of an elegant apartment) in an open plain, full of ideas quite different from tho&s;e he had brought with him.</P>
<P>On his return home, from the mo&s;t luxurious, he became one of the mo&s;t temperate men, by which wi&s;e method he &s;oon regained health. Frugality pro|duced riches, and from an infirm and crazy con&s;titution, and almo&s;t ruined e&s;tate, by virtue of this infallible elixir, he became one of the happie&s;t men breathing, and lived to a healthy old age, revered as an oracle for his wi&s;dom throughout all Greece.</P>
<P>If temperance be nece&s;&s;ary with re|gard to food, it is &s;till more &s;o with re|&s;pect to &s;trong liquors; the&s;e diffu&s;ible
<PB N="65" REF="71">&s;timuli, by quickly exhau&s;ting the exci|tability, &s;oon bla&s;t the vigour, and &s;ap the foundation of the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titu|tion. Their immediate effects you know are &s;timulant; they rai&s;e the ani|mal &s;pirits, produce a cheerful &s;tate of mind, and if taken in greater quantity, cau&s;e intoxication, or that temporary de|rangement of the thinking powers which ari&s;es from too great a degree of excite|ment: but let us &s;ee what happens the next day; the animal &s;pirits are ex|hau&s;ted, and the per&s;on thus &s;ituated, finds him&s;elf languid and enervated to a great degree; for it &s;eems a law of the human body, that the &s;pirits are never artificially rai&s;ed, without being after|wards proportionably depre&s;&s;ed; and to &s;hew clearly that in this &s;tate the exci|tability is exhau&s;ted, the ordinary pow|ers which in general &s;upport life, will not have their due effect; and a per&s;on thus &s;ituated finds mo&s;t relief the next day, from taking &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;timulus which occa&s;ioned the exhau&s;|tion;
<PB N="66" REF="72">becau&s;e the common exciting powers can &s;carcely act upon his ex|hau&s;ted excitability.</P>
<P>But though the excitability be in this way exhau&s;ted, it will in the cour&s;e of a day or two be again accumulated, and it may, perhaps, be &s;u&s;pected that this exhau&s;tion can do no harm at all to the con&s;titution; but this is a premature conclu&s;ion, and quite contrary to fact and experience, as well as to rea&s;on; for, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner that a pen|dulum, made to vibrate in the arc of a circle, will never return exactly to the &s;ame height, but fall a little &s;hort of it every time; &s;o, though the excitability may be again accumulated, it never can be brought back to what it was before; and every fre&s;h debauch will &s;horten life, probably two or three weeks at lea&s;t, be&s;ides debilitating the body, and bring|ing on a variety of di&s;ea&s;es, with pre|mature old age.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="73">
<P>Tho&s;e who drink only a moderate quantity of wine, &s;o as to make them cheerful, as they call it, but not ab&s;o|lutely to intoxicate, may imagine that it will do them no harm. The &s;trong and robu&s;t may enjoy the plea&s;ures of the bottle and table with &s;eeming impu|nity, and &s;ometimes for many years, may not find any bad effects from them; but depend upon it, if a full diet of ani|mal food be every day indulged in, with only a moderate portion of wine, its baneful influence will bla&s;t the vigour of the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>While we are eating, water is the be&s;t beverage. The cu&s;tom of drinking fer|mented liquors, and particularly wine, during dinner, is a very pernicious one. The idea that it a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, is fal&s;e; tho&s;e who are acquainted with chemi&s;try know, that food is hardened, and ren|dered le&s;s dige&s;tible by the&s;e means, and the &s;timulus which wine gives to the &s;tomach is not nece&s;&s;ary, excepting to
<PB N="68" REF="74">tho&s;e who have exhau&s;ted the excitabi|lity of that organ by the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong liquors. In the&s;e, the &s;tomach can &s;carcely be excited to any action without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a &s;timulus. If food wants diluting, water is the be&s;t diluent, and will prevent the ri&s;ing, as it is called, of &s;trong food, much better than wine or &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Before I fini&s;h this &s;ubject, I &s;hall &s;ay a few words on the pernicious cu&s;tom of &s;uffering children to drink wine, or other fermented liquors. Nothing is more common than to &s;ee, even very young children come to the table after dinner, to drink a gla&s;s of wine. The lea&s;t quantity produces violent effects on their accumulated excitability, and by quick|ly exhau&s;ting it, ruins their con&s;titutions through life, and often renders them ha|bitual drinkers.</P>
<P>I can &s;carcely help attributing in &s;ome degree the many &s;tomach complaints we
<PB N="69" REF="75">meet with, among young people in the pre&s;ent age, and which were unknown to our forefathers, to the abominable practice of &s;uffering children to drink fermented, or &s;pirituous liquors. You mu&s;t all have ob&s;erved how &s;oon chil|dren are intoxicated and inflamed by &s;pi|rituous liquors; you may judge then, that if the&s;e liquors be only a &s;low poi&s;on to us, they are a very quick one to them. A gla&s;s of wine, on account of the accumulated excitability of children, will have more effect upon them, than a bottle will have upon an adult accu&s;|tomed to drink wine. If therefore, the health of a child, and its happine&s;s through life be an object, never &s;uffer it to ta&s;te fermented, or &s;pirituous liquors, till it be fifteen or &s;ixteen years of age, unle&s;s a little wine be nece&s;&s;ary as a me|dicine.</P>
<P>It now only remains for me to take &s;ome notice of exerci&s;e. Of all the va|rious methods of pre&s;erving health, and
<PB N="70" REF="76">of preventing di&s;ea&s;es, which nature has &s;ugge&s;ted, there is none more efficacious than exerci&s;e, it puts the fluids all in motion, &s;trengthens the &s;olids, promotes per&s;piration, and occa&s;ions the decompo|&s;ition of a larger quantity of atmo&s;pheric air in the lungs. Hence, in order to pre&s;erve the health of the body, the au|thor of nature has made exerci&s;e ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the greater part of mankind for obtaining the means of ex|i&s;tence.&mdash;Had not exerci&s;e been ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for our well-being &s;ays the elegant Addi&s;on, nature would not have made the body &s;o proper for it, by giving &s;uch an activity to the limbs, and &s;uch a pliancy to every part, as ne|ce&s;&s;arily produce tho&s;e compre&s;&s;ions, ex|ten&s;ions, contortions, dilatations, and all other kinds of motions that are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of tubes and glands.&mdash;And that we might not want inducement to engage us in &s;uch exerci&s;e of the body as is proper for its welfare, it is &s;o ordered, that nothing
<PB N="71" REF="77">valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honors, even food and raiment are not to be come at without the toil of the hands and &s;weat of the brow. Providence furni&s;hes ma|terials, but expects that we &s;hould work them up our&s;elves. The earth mu&s;t be laboured before it gives its increa&s;e, and when it is forced into its &s;everal pro|ducts, how many hands mu&s;t they pa&s;s through before they are fit for u&s;e? Ma|nufactures, trade, and agriculture, natu|rally employ more than nineteen parts of the &s;pecies out of twenty; and as for tho&s;e who are not obliged to labour by the condition in which they are born, they are more mi&s;erable than the re&s;t of mankind, unle&s;s they indulge them&s;elves in that voluntary labour which goes by the name of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Of all the different kinds of exerci&s;e, there is none that conduces &s;o much to health as riding; it is not attended with the fatigue of walking, and the free air
<PB N="72" REF="78">is more enjoyed in this way than by any other mode of exerci&s;e. Where it can|not be u&s;ed, walking, or exerci&s;e in a carriage, ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted.</P>
<P>The be&s;t time for taking exerci&s;e is before dinner, for the body is then more vigorous and alert, and the mind more cheerful, and better di&s;po&s;ed to enjoy the plea&s;ure of a ride or walk. Exerci&s;e after a full meal di&s;turbs dige&s;tion, and cau&s;es painful &s;en&s;ations in the &s;tomach and bowels, with heart burn, and acid eructations.</P>
<P>But whatever mode of exerci&s;e you u&s;e, it ought not at fir&s;t to be too violent. Dr. Arm&s;trong has given us an excellent rule&mdash;</P>
