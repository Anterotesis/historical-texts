<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fifth Edition of this little Book being &s;old off, and the Book&s;eller calling on me to reprint it, I quickly determined to look it over carefully for that End; and what did not a little conduce to my publi&s;hing it again &s;o readily, was, the favourable Reception the former Editions met with from the Publick, who were &s;o indulgent as to e&s;teem it a plain hone&s;t Account of the Di&s;tempers it treats of, and (what I my &s;elf have not Vanity enough to think) more to the purpo&s;e than any thing wrote before.</P>
<P>THE great Experience al&s;o I have had (&s;ince I fir&s;t publi&s;hed this little Book) of the Method I re|commended in it as mo&s;t rational for the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> was anothor Motive of my venturing it again into the World; for I can truly &s;ay my Suc|ce&s;s in Curing Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es (having been ex|ceedingly great, greater perhaps than many can ea&s;ily believe) is a thorough Confirmation of the Efficacy of the Method I have mentioned to u&s;e, and by which I have re&s;tored abundance of People to perfect Health, who from the inveteracy of the Di&s;ea&s;e, length of Time they had been afflicted, and from their having often tried other Means in vain, almo&s;t de&s;paired of ever being Cured; of which I could give many In|&s;tances of Men of Worth and Probity, were it proper.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>I have added at the latter End, an Index to the whole, that tho&s;e who have not Lei&s;ure or Inclination to begin and read the Book quite through (which yet is much the be&s;t way) may however, by looking over That, know what it contains, and turn to the Page they think mo&s;t likely to inform them, of what they want chiefly to be acquainted with.</P>
<P>THE Index, con&s;idering the &s;mallne&s;s of the Book it &s;elf, may be thought &s;trange by &s;ome, it being as large as what is commonly found to a Book of &s;ix times the Bulk of this; but their wonder will cea&s;e, when the con&s;ider that this <HI>Short Account,</HI> under &s;ome Authors Pens, would have &s;well'd perhaps to more than &s;ix times its bigne&s;s, without containing more in Fact, than it does now. For my part, I think the fewer Words a Man expre&s;&s;es his Thoughts in, the bet|ter, provided he can be clearly under&s;tood; for to u&s;e more, or be prolix in Writing, &s;erves only, in my Opi|nion, to puzzle the Cau&s;e, or amu&s;e the Reader.</P>
<P>BUT who&s;oever Writes and Publi&s;hes his Thoughts upon any Subject to the World, would be vain in the la&s;t degree, &s;hould he expect every one would approve of them; the mo&s;t Correct Books in all Arts and Sci|ences, have ever met with ill-natur'd and unju&s;t Cen&s;ure from &s;ome, which indeed is no wonder, &s;ince <HI>Holy Writ</HI> it &s;elf has not e&s;caped the Ridicule of Profligate Wretches; it is truly &s;aid, unhappy is that Per&s;on of whom every one &s;peaks well, alluding that there never was or can be &s;uch a one, and in that Sen&s;e we may &s;ay, Vile and Contemptible is the Book, which every body likes: The Man therefore who &s;ets Pen to Paper, in order to communicate any thing to
<PB REF="4">the Publick, ought fir&s;t to re&s;olve to bear unmov'd, all the Calumny and invidious Reflections that Malice can invent.</P>
<P>THIS I fully determin'd when I began the follow|ing Treati&s;e, and &s;hall be altogether unconcerned for the Succe&s;s it meets with among&s;t the cavilling part of Mankind.</P>
<P>I have given my Thoughts freely on the <HI>Itch,</HI> in|veterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro|&s;y,</HI> under one or other of which, almo&s;t all Cuticular Eruptions, that are not the immediate Effects of acute Di&s;ea&s;es, may be compri&s;ed; I thought it need|le&s;s in this <HI>Short Account</HI> to treat particularly of <HI>Tetters, Ringworms,</HI> &amp;c. more e&s;pecially &s;ince the Medicines that will Cure the <HI>Itch,</HI> &amp;c. will likewi&s;e Cure them, and mo&s;t, if not all, other De|filements of the Skin that take their Ri&s;e from Chronick Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o opinionated of my own Performances, as to imagine that what I have written is without fault; yet I hope the Candid and Benevolent Rea|der will take what I have done in good Part.</P>
<P>HE that writes his Sentiments of any Di&s;temper, or concerning any Matter or Thing, with unfeigned Sincerity, is, in my Opinion, excu&s;able, tho' he may not be wholly free from Error, and tho' a great Mo|tive of it may be Self-Intere&s;t <HI>viz.</HI> gaining Honours, or increa&s;ing his Sub&s;tance; but tho&s;e are truly blama|ble, who to obtain either of the&s;e, publi&s;h to the World as &s;olemn Truths, their own &s;prightly Inventions, which have no real Foundation, and which in Fact, they do not believe them&s;elves.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>AND that &s;uch groundle&s;s Hypothe&s;es are to be found among Phy&s;ical Authors, and that plain deal|ing is a Virtue not always to be met with, may be ga|thered from the Works of Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> the mo&s;t worth and &s;incere Phy&s;ician <HI>Europe</HI> ever bred, who being importuned to write an Hi&s;tory of Chronick Di|&s;tempers, complained of the difficulty of &s;uch a Task, in the following Words.</P>
<P><Q>'FOR among Phy&s;ical Writers, if you except <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and &s;ome very few others, &s;carce any Foot&s;teps can be found whereby I might trace thro' the&s;e impa&s;&s;able Ways, ob&s;tructed with &s;o many Difficulties; for the Lights and Helps which Authors promi&s;e, are rather <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> than true Lights; which rather mi&s;guide to Rocks and Preci|pices, than direct for the finding the Genuine Me|thod of Nature; for mo&s;t of their Writings are built upon Hypothe&s;es proceeding from their own Fancies; and the very <HI>Phoenomena</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es, of which the Hi&s;tory of them con&s;i&s;ts, as they are de&s;cribed by the&s;e, are modelled in the &s;ame Shop of Suppo&s;itions, and the very Practice wherewith they undertake Di&s;ea&s;es, (which is the certain Plague and De&s;truction of Mankind) is &s;uited to this kind of <HI>Po&s;tulata,</HI> and not according to the Truth of the Thing, &s;o reigning are the&s;e Mens Whim&s;ies almo&s;t in every Page; and in the mean while the Directions of Nature are &s;lighted.'</Q></P>
<P>WHAT this mo&s;t Excellent Phy&s;ician &s;ays is very much to be lamented; for to be &s;wayed by an embrac'd Hypothe&s;is, and to be in&s;incere in what relates &s;o
<PB REF="6">eminently to Life, and Health the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing of it, mu&s;t &s;urely be highly Criminal, and in the la&s;t degree Barbarous.</P>
<P>IF I know my own Heart, I have wrote the fol|lowing Pages with that Integrity that becomes an hone&s;t Man, and have given as plain and natural an Account of the Illne&s;&s;es I have treated about, as I po&s;&s;ibly could; for the re&s;t I do not trouble my &s;elf, I pretend not to Correctne&s;s of Stile; all the u&s;e I know of Words, is to convey one Man's &s;en&s;e of Things to another, if therefore I can be under&s;tood, it is &s;ufficient: This I am &s;atisfied of, from very great Experience, that the Method I have de&s;cribed for the Cure of the Di&s;ea&s;es the Title mentions, will, if they are curable, by Ble&s;&s;ing of God, take Ef|fect; and not only in them, but in the <HI>King's-Evil,</HI> and all <HI>Scrophulous,</HI> Ca&s;es al&s;o, in a very &s;hort Time, in proportion to the inveteracy of them, provi|ded the Patients will follow Directions; and &s;uch of them who think fit to apply to me, may depend upon faithful and civil Treatment, as I am &s;ure all who have been under my Care hitherto, will acknowledge they have found, from</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The De&s;cription, Symptoms, Nature and dangerous Con&s;equences of the <HI>Itch,</HI> particular <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Itch</HI> is a filthy Di&s;temper, in|fe&s;ting the External Parts of the Bo|dy univer&s;ally, but more particular|ly the Joints, and between the Fin|gers, commonly with Pu&s;tulous E|ruptions rai&s;ed upon the Scarf-Skin, by almo&s;t unavoidable &s;cratching, occa&s;ioned thro' violent itching of the Parts; from the&s;e Pu&s;tulous Erup|tions or little Bladders, when broke, there i&s;|&s;ues a thin Cry&s;talline Humour, which touch|ing any other Part not yet infected, &s;oon cau&s;es ince&s;&s;ant itching, and upon &s;cratching, more Bladders to ari&s;e.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<P>AND by this means the <HI>Itch,</HI> in whatever Part it begins fir&s;t, is &s;oon &s;pread over the whole Body, and very remarkably fixes upon the Wri&s;ts, Hams, and e&s;pecially between the Fingers, which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes a real <HI>Itch</HI> from that &s;light itching of the Body, many People are troubled with for a &s;hort time, commonly about the beginning of Winter, and in the Spring, occa&s;ioned only by Strait|ne&s;s, or Con&s;tipation, of the Pores of the Skin, thro' change or coldne&s;s of the Sea&s;on, and which mo&s;tly goes away, upon enlarging or opening the Pores again, either by proper Exerci&s;e, or the help of the Bagnio, without further Trouble, or Medicines; yet if it con|tinues, it may lay the Foundation of a true <HI>Itch</HI> &s;oon after to follow, as will be &s;hewn hereafter.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Itch</HI> has continued long, and is become confirmed, the little Ulcerations en|crea&s;e, and the clear Humour, contained in the little Bladders, degenerates to a porulent Matter, which &s;till makes the Di&s;ea&s;e more Nau&s;eous and Infectious.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the <HI>Itch</HI> appears in a dry form, without tho&s;e Pu&s;tules before mention|ed, and then the Scarf-Skin looks red, rugged or uneven, and when by long continuance it is grown inveterate, the Parts affected are co|vered over with a dry kind of thin Scab, and this is the wor&s;t and mo&s;t &s;tubborn &s;ort of <HI>Itch,</HI> which, as well as the moi&s;t kind before &s;poken of, if neglected, in length of
<PB N="3" REF="10">Time, turns to a foul <HI>Scabies</HI> or <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> of the whole Body, quickly to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THE moi&s;t <HI>Itch,</HI> tho' not &s;o &s;tubborn o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> virulent as the dry kind, yet, by means of its moi&s;ture, &s;ooner and more ea&s;ily communi|cates its Infection to Sound Bodies.</P>
<P>AND &s;o Contagious is the <HI>Itch</HI> of either &s;ort, that lying in Bed with a Per&s;on troubled with it, or in the Sheets an itchy Per&s;on has lain in, or to wipe one's Hands with the &s;ame Cloth, or draw on a Glove &s;uch a Per&s;on has worn, or even to have Linnen wa&s;hed with the Linnen of one afflicted with the <HI>Itch,</HI> is &s;ufficient to catch the Di&s;temper and as the Famous and Ingenious Dr. <HI>Willi.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>'Certainly the Infection of no one Di&s;|ea&s;e is more ea&s;ily and certainly propagated (the Plague only excepted) than this of the <HI>Itch.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>YET &s;ome Per&s;ons are much more &s;ubject to be infected with it than others; for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> many there is a certain aptne&s;s to receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Di&s;ea&s;es of this kind, and &s;uch Per&s;ons catc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;ooner than others, as Experience demon+&s;trates; which difference 'tis likely may hap|pen through the Natural Structure of the External Pores of the Body, or their bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> larger in one Per&s;on than in another, &s;o a to imbibe or receive the infecting Humou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ooner and more &s;urely.</P>
<P>BUT when One Per&s;on in a Family o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hou&s;e is infected with the <HI>Itch,</HI> it commonl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> runs thro' the whole, and e&s;pecially &s;eizes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="4" REF="11">tho&s;e who Eat, Drink and Lye, or are very conver&s;ant with the Per&s;on who has &s;o acci|dentally caught it; and thus the <HI>Itch</HI> is com|municated from one Per&s;on, and one Family to another, by means of lying in &s;trange Beds, by Children of different Families playing to|gether, or by Servant Maids or Nur&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have had this loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, and come into Families before they are perfectly cured of it.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Itch</HI> is caught by Infection, the Scarf or outward Skin only, for &s;ome time, is infected, and the Blood not at all tainted with it, and then it may ea&s;ily and quickly be cured by proper Medicines regularly ad|mini&s;ter'd.</P>
<P>BUT when it has been neglected long, and the little Ulcers have crept deeper, and touched the <HI>Cutis</HI> or real Skin, &s;o that the infecting Humour penetrates the &s;mall Veins, and is circled about with the Blood, it &s;oon contaminates its whole Ma&s;s, and all the other Juices of the Body, and then becomes con|firmed, is more dangerous, and much more difficult to Cure.</P>
<P>SO al&s;o where it happens to aged People, and likewi&s;e if it is complicated with other Di&s;tempers, in which la&s;t Ca&s;e it mu&s;t be treated with the utmo&s;t Skill, for then the Circum&s;tances of the Patient will not often admit of its being cured after the neare&s;t manner, but require it to be managed with
<PB N="5" REF="12">great Care and Caution, and with a particular regard to the other Illne&s;&s;es that afflict the Patient; who otherwi&s;e may be kill'd in&s;tead of being cured, as in another Ca&s;e hap|pen'd to a certain Per&s;on labouring under a Con&s;umption of the Lungs and the <HI>Venereal</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e together, the Per&s;on he apply'd to for Cure imprudently put him into a Salivation for the latter, without minding the former, and &s;o de&s;troy'd him; for which he was de&s;ervedly Pro&s;ecuted in a Court of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>SOME Authors, Antient and Modern, are of the Opinion, that when the <HI>Itch</HI> has con|tinued many Months together, and got into the whole Habit of the Body, it cannot be cured; but with Submi&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t di&s;&s;ent from them, being &s;atisfy'd from my own Ex|perience, that the mo&s;t inveterate <HI>Itch</HI> may be perfectly and &s;afely cured, by the Rational Method recommended in the latter Part of this Book, of which I al&s;o flatter my &s;elf my Readers will be convinced.</P>
<P>YET that an inveterate <HI>Itch</HI> is much more difficult to Cure than a &s;light one, is mo&s;t certain, and Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> before-mentioned, &s;peaking of &s;ome of his Patients that were afflicted with the <HI>Itch,</HI> which proved &s;o &s;tub|born, that with the mo&s;t powerful Remedies, and even repeated Salivations, he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cure, tells us, that <Q>'The Veneral Di&s;ea&s;e tho' it be extreamly Malignant, and cau&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t foul Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oethick Ulcers that Eat th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="6" REF="13">Fle&s;h and Bones, may more ea&s;ily and cer|tainly be cured than the <HI>Itch.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER Author, writing upon this Di&s;temper, has the following Words, <Q>'I knew three Brothers, all young Men, die purely of the <HI>Itch,</HI> which by length of Time be|coming habitual, at la&s;t corrupted the whole Body, which with putrid and eating Ulcers de&s;troyed them.'</Q></P>
<P>AND thus we find Authors believe this Di&s;ea&s;e when grown inveterate, by being neg|lected too long, to be not only Incurable, but Mortal; but with them I cannot agree, for in my Opinion, the Di&s;ea&s;e that kill'd the Three Brothers the la&s;t quoted Author men|tions (judging by the latter part of his own Words) was rather a confirmed and univer|&s;al <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> properly the <HI>Itch</HI> it &s;elf, which I believe never proves Mortal till it turns to a loath&s;ome <HI>Scabbine&s;s,</HI> which indeed many times brings on Death.</P>
<P>HOWEVER certain it is, that there is a va&s;t Difference in this Di&s;temper, it being much harder to Cure in &s;ome Per&s;ons than in others; the Rea&s;on of which &s;eems very plain, and my Experience every Day confirms it more and more, to be generally &s;peaking thus, That tho&s;e in whom it proves &s;tubborn, are them&s;elves the occa&s;ion of it; for when they fir&s;t find they have caught the <HI>Itch,</HI> in&s;tead of
<PB N="7" REF="14">applying in&s;tantly to an ingenious Phy&s;ician for a regular Cure, as they ought to do, they tamper with it them&s;elves, and neither take and u&s;e trifling Remedies, &s;o as to let the Di&s;ea&s;e gain ground of it &s;elf, or el&s;e more mi&s;chievous ones, &s;o as ha&s;tily to fix it in the Blood and Juices, by which, of cour&s;e, it becomes very &s;tubborn and inveterate.</P>
<P>AN Example of which I very lately met with in a Trade&s;man, who having caught the <HI>Itch,</HI> follow'd the Advice of a Woman and other unskilful Per&s;ons, and al&s;o by u&s;ing &s;e|veral Pretended Infallible Remedies, on his own Head, had &s;o ingag'd the Di&s;ea&s;e, fix'd it in all his Fluids, and render'd it &s;o very &s;tub|born and inveterate, that it was with much difficulty I overcame it, and perfectly Cured him.</P>
<P>ONE would admire that People &s;hould be thus infatuated to their own Detriment, and, as &s;ometimes it proves, to their own De&s;tructi|on; but &s;o it is, and that not only now and then, but very frequently; and what one would &s;till more wonder at, I have almo&s;t daily Ac|counts from Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Sen&s;e and Worth, who apply to me for Cure in tho&s;e &s;tubborn Ca&s;es, of their having injured them|&s;elves in this Manner, which I think, can pro|ceed from nothing el&s;e, than that either they are a&s;ham'd to acquaint a Phy&s;ician that they are troubled with &s;uch a Di&s;temper, which is an Error, or el&s;e they imagine the <HI>Itch</HI> to be a Di&s;ea&s;e of little or no Con&s;equence

<P>BUT be&s;ides the Di&s;temper commonly call'd the <HI>Itch,</HI> there are particular and in|veterate <HI>Itching Humours</HI> of various Kinds or Appearances, that do not affect the Body univer&s;ally as That does, but fix upon par|ticular Parts only, as in &s;ome Per&s;ons upon the back of one or both of the Hands, in others upon the Shoulders or Arms, and in others upon one or both of the Thighs, or &s;ome other particular Parts, either of the Head, Face, Body or Limbs, many times about as broad as a Man's Hand; but &s;ome Per&s;ons have them much broader, and others much narrower; and in whatever Parts they fir&s;t appear, they mo&s;tly continue, &s;ometimes di|mini&s;hing and &s;ometimes increa&s;ing, in re&s;pect both to largene&s;s in inveteracy, for many Months and oftentimes Years together, un|le&s;s prudently managed and perfectly Cured, by Internal as well as External Reme|dies.</P>
<P>NOW and then the inveterate <HI>Itching Hu|mours</HI> of this kind in &s;ome Patients change their Station, and di&s;appearing in the Parts they fir&s;t affected, &s;oon after ari&s;e in others; but this they &s;eldom do, unle&s;s the Per&s;ons troubled with them, tamper with outward Applications, which, alone, are dangerous,
<PB N="9" REF="16">as will be made appear in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>THESE particular <HI>Itching Humours,</HI> in whatever Parts they &s;hew them&s;elves, make the Scarf-Skin look Red, Angry and Un|equal, and be&s;ides the violent Itching that mo&s;tly attends them, little Pimples, upon &s;cratching, commonly ari&s;e, that are very fore for a &s;hort time, and often &s;end forth a thin Humour, that may be &s;een &s;tanding upon the Parts affected, almo&s;t like Dew, and when the Sorene&s;s abates, the Pimples dimini&s;h, and the Itching increa&s;es, and then little dry Scurf falls off, and fre&s;h Pimples &s;oon ari&s;e, &s;o that there is un&s;ufferable itching, and &s;ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;orene&s;s, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, which proves exceeding trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e unhap|pily fatigued therewith.</P>
<P>THESE inveterate <HI>Itching Humours</HI> differ not much from the Di&s;ea&s;e, called <HI>Scabies</HI> or <HI>Scabbine&s;s,</HI> excepting only that they confine them&s;elves to particular Parts, as before &s;hewn, and That mo&s;tly affects the Body univer&s;ally</P>

<PB N="10" REF="17">the <HI>Cutis</HI> or real Skin, which it gnaws and ulcerates, and cau&s;es na&s;tly Scabs to cover the Parts.</P>
<P>IF it follows the moi&s;t <HI>Itch,</HI> foul Ichorous Matter i&s;&s;ues from them, which is very con|tagious, and infects and found Part it touches; but if it &s;ucceeds the dry <HI>Itch,</HI> there is &s;eldom any Pus i&s;&s;ues from the Scabs, which then appear very cru&s;ty, dry and nau&s;eous to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES a <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> happens when the <HI>Itch</HI> has not gone before it, but this is not near &s;o frequent as the <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> following the <HI>Itch,</HI> which as before &s;aid, is generally a Preludium to this hateful Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>A <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> is al&s;o accompany'd with itch|ing as well as &s;orene&s;s, e&s;pecially about the Edges of the &s;mall Ulcers that void a foul cor|rupted Pus in the moi&s;t kind, and about the cru&s;ty Scabs in the dry &s;ort.</P>
<P>AN univer&s;al <HI>Scabbine&s;s,</HI> as it is much wor&s;e than the <HI>Itch</HI> for Filthine&s;s and Putre|faction, &s;o it is much more dangerous and difficult to Cure.</P>
<P>IF it continues long without being Cured, the Ulcerations increa&s;e in number as well as largene&s;s, and the di&s;charge of Matter from them is &s;o great, the Humours continually flowing that way, that the Body being robb'd or drain'd of its moi&s;ture, falls of cour&s;e into a Con&s;umption, which, together with the fatigue the Patient undergoes in the Day time, and want of Re&s;t and Sleep at Night, oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="11" REF="18">by continual alternate itching and &s;marting, quickly fini&s;hes the fatal Cata&s;trophe, and the unhappy Patient is obliged to &s;ubmit to a mi&s;erable Death.</P>
<P>BUT this mu&s;t be under&s;tood only of the moi&s;t <HI>Scabbine&s;s,</HI> for the dry one, tho' very Inveterate and Malign, yet &s;eldom or never is attended with Death, but fir&s;t u&s;hers in a poi&s;onous <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> that, if not timely Cured, &s;oon puts a Period to the Patient's Life.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> is the mo&s;t Malignant Di&s;tem|per that affects the External Parts of the Body, the Blood and Juices being contaminated with its fatal Poi&s;on, whence proceeds the great Difficulty of curing it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> is &s;ometimes the Hereditary Di&s;ea&s;e of the Family, but is much more com|monly contracted by Infection.</P>
<P>AND it may indeed be termed, as in the Learned Dr. <HI>Blancard</HI>'s Phy&s;ical Dictionary, a Di&s;ea&s;e, by which, <Q>'The Temperature, Form, and Figure, and at la&s;t the very Continuity of the Body is corrupted; <HI>and as he again &s;ays,</HI> 'Is a Canker commonly to the whole Body.'</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Itch</HI> and <HI>Scabies</HI> are u&s;ually the Fore|runners of it, for the <HI>Itch,</HI> being neglected, turns to an univer&s;al <HI>Scabies,</HI> and That to the <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> as before &s;hewn, which is the wor&s;t of Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es, and accompanied with the highe&s;t degree of Corruption and Putre|faction.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="19">
<P>THE Symptoms accompanying this direful Di&s;ea&s;e, are both Internal and External con|ci&s;ely &s;umm'd up as follow:</P>
<Q><P>'THE Internal are Acid or Mu&s;ty Belch|ings, Co&s;tivene&s;s, Thir&s;t, a &s;tinking Sweat, thick Urine, in&s;omuch, that the Powder of Lead will &s;wim upon it; an extream propen|&s;ity to Venery; thickne&s;s, vi&s;co&s;ity, and unctuo&s;ity of the Blood when drawn forth, and little Clots of Sand &s;ticking to the Cloth thro' which it is &s;trained; &s;tinking Breath, a weari|ne&s;s of the Limbs, Chilne&s;s, Stupidity, and a hoar&s;e Voice, as if it came thro' the No&s;e.'</P>
<P>'THE External Symptoms are the&s;e, the Skin appears livid, black or yellow; it wrinkles when expo&s;ed to the Cold; it is notably rough and oily, in&s;omuch, that Wa|ter will not &s;tick to it; it is covered over with a Purple or white Dandriff; little moveable painle&s;s Knots and Swellings be&s;et the Forehead, Chin and Joints; a dry Ring|worm and Pu&s;hes cover the whole Body, and affect not only the Skin but the Mu&s;cles; an eternal <HI>Itch</HI> like the gnawing of Worms, or pricking with Needles mole&s;ts 'em; when they &s;cratch any Part, it turns dry and &s;caly, but voids no Matter; the Hair of their Head and Eyebrows falls of; their Forehead is furrowed with wrinkles; their Ears &s;tretched and &s;welled; the Eyebrows callous and rai&s;ed; their Eyes round red and &s;parkling, infe&s;ted with little hard &s;wel|lings in the corners, and apt to water; the
<PB N="13" REF="20">upper Part of their No&s;e contracted, while the inferiour is enlarged, troubled with fre|quent &s;neezing, and infe&s;ted with a Polypus and Cancrous corro&s;ive Ulcers; the Face and Lips are pale, hard, livid, and chop'd; their Tongue and Mouth liable to hard Swellings, Chops and Corro&s;ion; the Gums rough and &s;wol'n; the Spittle Vi&s;cous; their Brea&s;ts hard, and their Veins &s;wol'n; the Joints wither'd, and be&s;et with callous indolent Ulcers, that are apt to bleed upon the &s;lighte&s;t touch; the Mu&s;cles of their Hands, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Thumb, and fir&s;t Finger, are much con&s;umed; the Fin|gers and Toes benumb'd; the Joints di&s;torted and knotty, and the Nails black, bowed and chopped.'</P></Q>
<P>THE Reader, I pre&s;ume will readily allow, that Per&s;ons labouring under all the&s;e Symp|toms, can have but &s;mall, if any hopes of Life, and indeed here are &s;o many dreadful ones enumerated, that the very Thoughts of them, one would think, are &s;ufficient not only to &s;ink a Per&s;on Afflicted with them to the Grave, but al&s;o to make him de&s;ire a &s;peedy Death, as a kind Relief to the grievous Mi|&s;ery he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily endure.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t not be imagined, that every one affected with the <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> is afflicted with all the&s;e Symptoms; &s;ome Per&s;ons are not troubled with one half of them, and yet are as &s;urely <HI>Leprous</HI> as tho&s;e labouring under the greate&s;t part, or all, that have been &s;umm'd up.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="21">
<P>THE mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing Sign of the <HI>Lepro|&s;y,</HI> is the Fi&s;h like Scales, of a Branny Colour, that fall from the External Parts of the di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;on; and whether that is attended with many more of the before-mentioned Symptoms, as it mo&s;tly is, or not, it be&s;peaks the <HI>Le|pro&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ooner the Cure of this Di&s;temper is undertaken, and the fewer the Symptoms are, the better it will be overcome, and the &s;ooner and more certainly will the Patient be re&s;tored to Health; but if it be neglected for a con&s;i|derable time, till the Symptoms are multi|pied, the Strength of the Patient much im|paired, and the Di&s;ea&s;e arrived to the highe&s;t degree, it may then be &s;aid to be incurable, and the &s;uffering Wretch has nothing more to do, than to &s;ettle his Worldly Affairs, com|mit his Soul to God who gave it, and pati|ently expect his Di&s;&s;olution to put a final End to his intolerable Torment.</P>
<P>BY the Account and De&s;cription of the Symptoms, Nature and Danger of the Exter|nal Di&s;ea&s;es here given, I think it plainly ap|pears how inexcu&s;ably remi&s;s, and in the la&s;t degree negligent of them&s;elves tho&s;e Per&s;ons are, who being afflicted in the &s;lighte&s;t man|ner with Cutaneous Di&s;tempers, or &s;uch as affect the External Parts univer&s;ally, omit to &s;eek for a regular Cure in time, &s;ince it has been &s;ufficiently proved, that the mo&s;t trifling <HI>Itch,</HI> if neglected, becomes more and more inveterate, and advances &s;tep by &s;tep, from
<PB N="15" REF="22">one degree to another, till from the <HI>Itch</HI> it turns to an univer&s;al and nau&s;eous <HI>Scabies,</HI> which many times kills the Patients unfortunnately troubled with it, and if it does not, turns to a loath&s;ome <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> that very often proves in|curable, and fails not to render the unhappy Sufferers, and oftentimes their Po&s;terity after them, mi&s;erable Spectacles to others, as well as lamentable Torments to them&s;elves, and at la&s;t accompli&s;hes their De&s;truction, by the unavoidable Death it certainly brings on.</P>
<P>AND no le&s;s imprudent are they, who being troubled with <HI>Tetters, Ringworms,</HI> and other breakings out, in particular Parts, neg|lect to get Cured; for they are for the mo&s;t part Species of one or other of the Di&s;ea&s;es I have de&s;cribed, and are of very ill Con&s;equence, if not quickly remedied.</P>
<P>I have not inlarged on tho&s;e &s;everal breakings out, by their particular Names, as found in Authors, becau&s;e, as they may be comprehend|ed under the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabies,</HI> or <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> which I have di&s;cour&s;ed on I would neither tire the Reader's Patience, or &s;well the&s;e Papers beyond my fir&s;t Intention.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Original Cau&s;e of the <HI>Itch,</HI> in|veterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbi|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the External Di&s;ea&s;es I treat of, are for the mo&s;t part occa&s;ioned by In|fection, is very certain, there being, I believe, &s;carcely One Per&s;on in Fifty troubled with them, but what were infected by others in the manner I have &s;hewn in the foreging Chapter; yet as the communicating of them from one Per&s;on to another, cannot properly be called the Cau&s;e, but rather the &s;preading of Di&s;ea&s;es before cau|&s;ed, I de&s;ign here, pa&s;&s;ing over that, as &s;ufficient|ly proved and already known, to proceed to an enquiry after the Original Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Cuta|neous Di&s;tempers, when they ari&s;e and hap|pen to Per&s;ons who have not been infected by, or received them from others, and that from the Opinions of &s;ome of the Ancient as well as Modern Phy&s;icians, many of whom a&s;&s;ign the <HI>Itch, Scabies, Lepro&s;y,</HI> &amp;c. to one and the &s;ame Cau&s;e, and are of Opinion that tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es differ from one another only in degree. Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t be al|low'd, that inveterate <HI>Itching Humours</HI> in par|ticular Parts, are &s;ometimes of a Scrophulous Nature, and proceed from the <HI>King's-Evil.</HI></P>
<PB N="17" REF="24">
<P><HI>GALEN</HI> lays the fault of Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin on melancholy or adu&s;t Matter.</P>
<P><HI>AVICEN</HI> is of Opinion that, <Q>'Blood with which Choler is mixt, and that with Salt Flegm converted into Melancholy, is the cau&s;e of <HI>Scabbine&s;s.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>LANGIUS</HI> accu&s;es, <Q>'Impure Cholerick Blood, or adu&s;t and Faeculent, mixt with Li|quor of Salt Flegm (produced by di&s;cracy of the Liver, and oftentimes ob&s;truction of the Spleen) as the cau&s;e of the <HI>Itch.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>THE Learned Dr. <HI>Blancard,</HI> in his Phy|&s;ical Dictionary, &s;ays, the <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> is cau&s;ed by <Q>'Black Bile diffu&s;ed thro' the whole Body.'</Q></P>
<P>OTHERS are al&s;o of the Opinion, that the <HI>Itch</HI> proceeds from <Q><P>'Choler, &s;ubtilized and &s;ent into the Habit of the Body, which be|ing mixt with thin Salt Flegm, and &s;pread|ing into the Superficies of the Body, breaks out in the <HI>Cuticula</HI> with &s;mall watery Pu|&s;tules cau&s;ing great Itching.'</P>
<P>'THAT a <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> proceeds from Blood and Lympha defiled with Excrementitious Humours, not &s;ufficiently &s;eparated and ex|pelled by Urine, Stool, Sweat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the Sanguineous and Lymphatick Juices mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be corrupted with &s;harp and biting Humours, mixt with Salt Flegm and adu&s;t Choler.'</P>
<PB N="18" REF="25">
<P>THAT the <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> is cau&s;ed by 'Salt Flegm po&s;&s;ibly putrified with a mixture of oily Humours, as a depraved Lympha and adu&s;t Choler.'</P>
<P>AND that the remote Cau&s;es of this De|pravation of the Choler and Lympha, are 'Feeding upon Salt, Acrid and Hot Meats; al&s;o want of Cleanline&s;s, or keeping the Body &s;weet and clean.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> believes the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Itch,</HI> &amp;c. to be the Depravation of the Humour of the Cutaneous Glands:</P>
<P><Q><P>'THE Glandulous Humour, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> de|praved either by the Blood being very im|pure, and al&s;o di&s;&s;olved, leaving its Cor|ruption and Recrements plentifully in the Cutaneous Glands, which there a&s;&s;uming the Nature of a more Corro&s;ive Ferment, does ferment and variou&s;ly Coagulate with other Juices that come thither or pa&s;s that way, and &s;o produces the <HI>Itch,</HI> &amp;c. or the Humour gathered in the Cutaneous Glands, &s;ome|times by mere Stagnation, becomes not only Itchy but Corruptive. Therefore tho&s;e kept long in Pri&s;on, or that lead a Sedentary Life, and are u&s;ed to filth and &s;tink, are Obnoxious to the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es.'</P>
<P>AGAIN, the &s;ame Author tells us, That in a <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> '<HI>Acido-Saline</HI> Con|cretions (like Tartar in Wine) do happen in the Ma&s;s of Blood, which when they
<PB N="19" REF="26">cannot be conquered or di&s;&s;olved, are dri|ven to the Skin, as in the other Ca&s;e, <HI>(viz. Wine)</HI> to the &s;ides of the Cask.'</P></Q></P>
<P>THE Excellent <HI>Etmuller</HI> a&s;&s;igns the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Itch,</HI> to <Q><P>'Sharp Particles of the <HI>Serum,</HI> repairing to the Surface in &s;mall Quantities.'</P>
<P>OF a <HI>Scabbine&s;s,</HI> to the 'Depravation of the Nutritive <HI>Serum,</HI> or Juice of the Parts under the Skin, occa&s;ioned by a Preternatural Acid, that takes its Ri&s;e from &s;udden Cold, &s;ucceeding Heat, and &s;hutting up the Steams of the Body within the &s;traitned Pores; and which by continuance may at la&s;t infect the Blood.'</P>
<P>HE al&s;o &s;ays, that 'A <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> proceeds &s;ometimes, but very rarely, from Internal Cau&s;es, as <HI>Scurvy, French-Pox,</HI> &amp;c.'</P>
<P>AND treating of the <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> he gives his Opinion that it is cau&s;ed by 'A Saline Cor|ro&s;ive Acid reigning in the <HI>Serum.</HI>'</P>
<P>HE likewi&s;e ingeniou&s;ly gives the Rea&s;on why Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ometimes moi&s;t and &s;ometimes dry, as follows:</P>
<P>'IF the Nutritive Juice be very &s;erous and apt to corrupt, the Breakings out run much; if balmy and impregnated with a Volatile Oily Salt, they are cru&s;ty and dry.'</P></Q></P>
<P>BY what has been &s;aid, it appears how much Phy&s;icians differ from one another, concerning the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Cutaneous Di&s;tempers, but in my Judgment the two la&s;t quoted Authors
<PB N="20" REF="27">have hit the Mark much nearer than others, and their Opinions, which amount almo&s;t to one and the &s;ame thing, will appear more Ra|tional, if what the accurate and learned Phy|&s;ician Dr. <HI>J. Keill</HI> &s;ays concerning the Scarf-Skin, in his Anatomy of the Human Body abridg'd, be con&s;ider'd; his Words follow:
<Q><P>'THIS <HI>(i. e. the Scarf-Skin)</HI> is that &s;oft Skin which ri&s;es in a Bli&s;ter upon any burn|ing, or the application of a Bli&s;tering Plai&s;ter. It &s;ticks clo&s;e to the Surface of the true Skin, to which it is al&s;o tied by the Ve&s;&s;els which nouri&s;h it, tho' they are &s;o &s;mall as not to be &s;een; when we examine the Scarf-Skin with a Micro&s;cope, it appears to be made up of &s;everal Lays of exceeding &s;mall Scales, which cover one another more or le&s;s, according to the different thickne&s;s of the Scarf-Skin in the &s;everal Parts of the Body. In the Lips where the Scales appear plaine&s;t, becau&s;e the Skin is thine&s;t, they only in a manner touch one another. Now the&s;e Scales are either the excretory Ducts of the Glands of the true Skin, as I think is apparent in Fi&s;hes, or el&s;e the&s;e Glands have their Pipes opening between the Scales.'</P>
<P>'THESE Scales are often glewed one to another by the gro&s;&s;er parts of our in&s;en&s;ible Tran&s;piration, hardening upon them by the Heat of our Body, which carries off the more Volatile Particles. The Humour which is afterwards &s;eparated by the Glands of the Skin, being pent in between the
<PB N="21" REF="28">Scales, cau&s;es frequent Itchings, and where the Matter has been longer pent up, &s;mall Pimples.'</P></Q> Thus far the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Keill.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if the Humour de&s;igned by Nature to be excreted, by being pent in, thro' Cold or any other Accident, cau&s;es frequent <HI>Itchings,</HI> and by a longer continuance, &s;mall Pimples, as certainly it does, why may it not be &s;up|po&s;ed, according to <HI>Willis</HI> and <HI>Etmuller,</HI> that, by a yet longer Confinement or Stagnation, it will be depraved, become corruptive, and at la&s;t infectious, e&s;pecially if the remote Cau&s;es, &s;uch as leading a Sedentary Life, eating Salt Meats, the Relicks of other Di&s;tempers, or liv|ing in Na&s;tine&s;s or Filth, have ob&s;tructed or impaired the Glandules of the Body, or any way injured their Structure, and al&s;o cau&s;ed irregular Cohae&s;ions of Particles in the Blood and Juices, &s;o as to make them apt upon the lea&s;t Stagnation to Corrupt and Putrify?</P>
<P>MUCH might be &s;aid to &s;trengthen and de|fend this Opinion; yet after all the fine Spe|culations and Notions Men have, and propa|gate concerning the Original Cau&s;e of the&s;e and many other Di&s;ea&s;es, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged that it is doubtful, whether we can more than gue&s;s at the real E&s;&s;ence of them; and the mo&s;t faithful Phy&s;ician that ever wrote, the Immortal <HI>Sydenham,</HI> our Coun|tryman, appears to have had the &s;ame Senti|ments, when treating of another Di&s;temper he tells us:</P>
<PB N="22" REF="29">
<P><Q>'AS to the intrin&s;ick Nature and E&s;&s;ence of this Di&s;ea&s;e, as they &s;ay, I count I am to &s;eek for it no further than as it appears by the Symptoms we have de&s;cribed, no more than I am obliged to &s;earch into the E&s;&s;ence of any Plant or Animal.'</Q></P>
<P>THIS admirable Man being &s;en&s;ible, no doubt, of the in&s;ufficiency of Human Rea&s;on to penetrate into the Ab&s;tru&s;e Principles or fir&s;t moving Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;eems to have apply'd him&s;elf wholly to the Ob&s;ervation of Di&s;tempers, their &s;everal Symptoms, Stages and Terminations, together with the mo&s;t Natural and Effectual Method of curing them, as his admirable Works, &s;o ju&s;tly valued all over <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hew.</P>
<P>AND it would be well if all Per&s;ons who Practi&s;e Phy&s;ick, and who have the good of Mankind mo&s;t at Heart, would Copy after the Learned and Incomparable <HI>Sydenham,</HI> who&s;e Works will never Die, and who&s;e Ex|ample all ought to follow, and not be forward to broach New Notions, and &s;train every thing to &s;upport an embrac'd Hypothe&s;is, or to a&s;&s;ert this or that to be the Original Cau&s;e of any Di&s;temper, unle&s;s it could be made appear by undeniable Demon&s;tration; but rather apply them&s;elves diligently to the Ob|&s;ervation of Di&s;ea&s;es, thro' their Beginning, State and Declination, and be thereby per|fectly acquainted with all their Symptoms, Variations, and Con&s;equences, &s;o as to be able &s;afely and quickly to Cure them, which I
<PB N="23" REF="30">am &s;ure all unprejudic'd Per&s;ons will agree, would be much better for the unhappy Patients afflicted with Di&s;tempers, than for their Phy|&s;icians to be taken up with airy Speculations concerning them, and at the &s;ame time per|haps, be at a Lo&s;s how to effect their Cure</P>
<P>AND, indeed, the many Mi&s;takes there are made, and Errors committed in the Cure of Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es, even by tho&s;e from whom one would be far from expecting Mi&s;manage|ment, are very &s;urprizing, and what I could not believe, if almo&s;t daily Experience did not con|vince me of it, of which I could give very many Examples, but that I think it much better rather to draw a Veil over the Mi&s;carriages of others, than expo&s;e them to Publick View.</P>

<P>MOST Authors agree, that the &s;ame Method and Medicines that will Cure an inveterate <HI>Itch,</HI> will likewi&s;e take Place in a <HI>Scabbine&s;s, Lepro&s;y,</HI> and mo&s;t other Defilements of the Skin, if curable; and indeed Experience an&s;wers for the Truth of it, only with this difference, that the Method mu&s;t be clo&s;ely fol|lowed for a longer Time, and the Medicines be made &s;tronger for a <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> than it is requi&s;ite they &s;hould be for the fir&s;t men|tioned Infection.</P>
<P>BUT what that Method and tho&s;e Medi|cines are, that with the greate&s;t Certainty, lea&s;t Trouble, and without Danger, will ac|compli&s;h the Cure of Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es, is what Phy&s;icians differ very much about.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="32">
<P>SOME recommend Bleeding and Purging as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; the fir&s;t to cau&s;e Re|vul&s;ion, temperate the Blood, and allay its too great Ebullition, the la&s;t to clean&s;e the Stomach, Bowels, and all the Juices, from Impurities, and both of them to dimini&s;h the Humours of the Body in general, without all which, they are of Opinion the <HI>Itch</HI> and other Defaedations cannot &s;afely or ea&s;ily, if at all, be cured.</P>
<P>OTHERS advi&s;e to <HI>Sudorificks,</HI> or Sweat|ing Medicines; and others to <HI>Diureticks,</HI> or &s;uch as work by Urine; &s;ome neglecting all eva|cuating Medicines, pre&s;cribe &s;weetners of the Blood, and cooling <HI>Alteratives,</HI> which they be|lieve will Cure by &s;ubduing the Cholerick Di&s;|po&s;ition and Acrid Quality of the Juices.</P>
<P>OTHERS, laying a&s;ide all Internal Reme|dies, rely wholly upon External Applications for the Cure of Cuticular Maladies, &s;uch as Ointments, Baths and Wa&s;hes, made of Tobac|co, Brim&s;tone, Elecampane, Sharp pointed Dock, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and others chiefly in&s;i&s;t on Mer|cury or Quick&s;ilver, outwardly applied, either by a Girdle, or mix'd with Unguents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they &s;ay will effectually kill the <HI>Itch,</HI> and other Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin.</P>
<P>THUS Phy&s;ical Authors vary exceedingly in their Opinions one from another, and each brings &s;everal Rea&s;ons and Arguments to &s;up port the Opinion he is of, or has advanced Tho&s;e who plead mo&s;t for External Applica+tions, have but an indifferent Opinion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Purging, and inveigh mightily again&s;t Bleed|ing,
<PB N="26" REF="33">which they &s;ay draws the foul Humour, that either never reached deeper than the Skin, or el&s;e that Nature had kindly expelled to the outer Parts, into the Blood and Juices, &s;o as certainly to corrupt them, and fix the Di&s;tem|per upon the whole Habit of the Body, and thereby render it incurable.</P>
<P><HI>MARTIANUS</HI> gives an Account of a certain Per&s;on, <Q><P>'Who labouring under the <HI>Itch,</HI> would have Four Pound of Blood taken from him by opening a Vein, upon which, that very Day, revul&s;ion of the Putrid Humour being made from the Skin to the greater Veins by Venae-Section, he was taken with a Malignant Fever, which kill'd him the Fifth Day.'</P>
<P>'LETTING Blood <HI>(&s;ays another Author)</HI> mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be avoided in this Cure, for thereby the Impurity is drawn into the Blood, and that defiled which before was pure.'</P></Q></P>
<P>THE famous <HI>Helmont</HI> mentions purging Medicines in this Di&s;temper, as well as in other Ca&s;es, with Deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Willis,</HI> among&s;t many others, is of Opinion, that both Bleeding and Purging in Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>SPEAKING of Bleeding he &s;ays, <Q><P>'The Effect is not taken away till fir&s;t the Cau&s;e be removed, which may this way properly be done. Yea for an univer&s;al Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;uch as the <HI>Itch</HI> is, an univer&s;al Remedy, &s;uch as letting Blood is, &s;eems convenient.'</P>

<P>BESIDES the Authorities of the&s;e Great and Learned Men for Bleeding and Purging in the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> there are many Examples given by Authors, of the unhappy Con&s;equences o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> attempting the Cure of External Di&s;ea&s;es by outward Applications only.</P>

<P>BY the&s;e Accounts, among&s;t many others, that are left upon Record, to warn us again&s;t the like irrepairable Mi&s;chiefs, the Readers may judge what Care there ought to be taken, and what Skill there is required in curing Chronick Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin; and I believe it will be ea&s;ily allow'd, that it is not only re|qui&s;ite to Cure them &s;urely, but &s;afely too; for to omit Internal Remedies, and &s;trike in tho&s;e Di&s;tempers by external and repelling Ap|plications, tho' ever &s;o &s;eemingly innocent in them&s;elves, may be attended with very bad
<PB N="29" REF="36">Accidents, &s;uch as violent Fevers, A&s;thmas, Con&s;umptions of the Lungs, Convul&s;ions, Fall|ing Sickne&s;s, Pal&s;ies, Apoplexies, Madne&s;s, internal Ulcers, Scirrhous Tumours, and other dangerous, and oftentimes incurable Maladies, under which, if the Patients e&s;cape with Life, they may remain mi&s;erable all their Days.</P>
<P>FOR when the malignant Humour is thus forc'd to retire from the external Parts of the Body, it is then circled about with the Blood, till it is depo&s;ited and fix'd upon &s;uch of the No|ble internal Parts, as happen to be mo&s;t weak, or apt to receive it. Thus if it falls on the Brain and Nerves, it produces the Apoplexy, Falling-Sickne&s;s, Pal&s;y, Convul&s;ions, or Madne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If it happens to fix on the Brea&s;t, it cau&s;es a vio|lent Cough, dreadful A&s;thma, or Ulceration of the Lungs and incurable Con&s;umption; if upon the Urinary Parts, it occa&s;ions the Di&s;ea&s;es com|mon to them, &s;uch as racking Pains, Dy&s;ury, Strangury, incurable Ulceration of the Kidneys, or Bladder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If upon the Liver and Spleen, Ob&s;tructions and Scirrhous Tumours of tho&s;e Parts are produced; if it fixes on the Bowels, it cau&s;es a &s;evere Cholick, Diarrhaea, Dy&s;ente|ry, Inflammation of the Gutts, or Illiack Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if it does not happen to lodge on any of tho&s;e particular Parts, it then commonly inflames the whole Ma&s;s of Blood univer&s;ally, and &s;o produces violent Fevers, continual or intermitting, threatning &s;peedy Death.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="37">
<P>AND the Illne&s;&s;es that happen by &s;uch im|prudent Management, &s;ometimes do not appear till &s;ome Months after &s;uch outward Applica|tions have been forborn.</P>
<P>WHAT a ri&s;que therefore do tho&s;e run, who, being unhappily troubled with the <HI>Itch,</HI> or any other Cutaneous Di&s;temper, endeavour to Cure them&s;elves with Ointments, Wa&s;hes, Quick&s;ilver Girdles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which if they do not take effect, as very often happens, are then a very great Fatigue to them to no purpo&s;e, and if they do Cure, then expo&s;e them to the Danger of wor&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, and even Lo&s;s of Life.</P>
<P>THE Ingenious Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> in the Appendix to his Book, intituled, <HI>Medicina Gymna&s;tica,</HI> informs us, that he &s;plit upon this Rock, and endured the mo&s;t violent Illne&s;s imaginable for many Years together, by means of curing him&s;elf, with a Quick&s;ilver Girdle, of an <HI>Itch</HI> that he had accidentally caught; an Ab&s;tract of which take as follows:</P>
<Q><P>'I wore it <HI>(&s;ays he, meaning a Mercurial Girdle)</HI> for &s;everal Months by times, and then laid it quite a&s;ide; but the Mi&s;chief was be|gun, tho' I was not aware of it; for about a Month after, I awak'd one Morning with an unu&s;ual Giddine&s;s, and in a little time after, I found &s;everal Convul&s;ions begin to come upon me, in the Capillary Arteries of my Eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sometimes I &s;hould have my Hands drawn in, and my Fingers brought to the Palm of my Hand involuntarily. I
<PB N="31" REF="38">was not a little terrified, as any may imagine; but by proper means the &s;everity of the Symptoms went off, and I remain'd only with a Giddine&s;s, which was very trouble|&s;ome. Once upon drinking the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters too long, that Vertiginous Rotation was &s;o increa&s;ed, that I was laid up for a Month with it, being &s;carce able to go about with|out &s;taggering like a drunken Man; but this extremity abated, and I remain'd heal|thy under that Giddine&s;s for &s;everal Years, till happening once to be more indi&s;po&s;ed than u&s;ually, upon taking a Chalybeate, the Humour &s;truck deeper into the Nerves of the Pectoral Mu&s;cles; &s;o that I found my Shoulders begin to be contracted involuntari|ly, and upon walking, a &s;hortne&s;s of Breath, which I could di&s;cern, was cau&s;ed by the preternatural pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e Mu&s;cles upon my Brea&s;t, which I have &s;ometimes re&s;i&s;ted &s;o far, when it has happen'd to come upon me in the Streets, before I could get to a Hou&s;e I knew, that it has made my Eyes Fla&s;h, and brought other Epileptick Symp|toms upon me, that I have been forced to take into a Shop, and de&s;ire leave to re&s;t me for a time. The&s;e Things continued on me for a Year or more, and declining under the&s;e Spa&s;ms of my Brea&s;t, I was at length quite confined to my Home for near three Months, all the while growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, in &s;pite of the Power of any Medi|cines I took, when it happend that I was
<PB N="32" REF="39">ca&s;ually directed to the u&s;e of Riding, in order to which I removed to <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> where I rode at lea&s;t twice a Day, for the &s;pace of Seven Weeks. After I had by the&s;e means recovered a good Mea&s;ure of Health, I enjoyed it about a Year and half, by the help of Riding at due Intervals; but think|ing my &s;elf &s;tronger than I really was, and Riding long Journies, I was took of a &s;ud|den with the &s;trange&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Deliquium (or Fainting)</HI> that perhaps ever was heard of; to the&s;e &s;ort of Fits was added a <HI>Diarrhaea (or Loo&s;ne&s;s)</HI> which was attended with a Nau&s;e|ou&s;ne&s;s and Inclination to Vomit; and what is Remarkable, tho&s;e Nights after my Vomiting, I &s;hould Sweat to that degree, as to make my Shirt and Sheets as wet as if they had been dip'd in Water, upon which I was refre&s;hed and freed from the greater &s;e|verity of tho&s;e Symptoms, which plainly &s;hews how pernicious that P&s;oradick <HI>(or Itchy)</HI> Salt was, which the Mercurial Particles had repelled and intimately mix'd in my Blood.'</P>
<P>'THUS I had three Calamities upon me at once, a Flux, a Vomiting, and the <HI>Deli|quiums (or Faintings)</HI> I &s;poke of before, the la&s;t of which had &s;omething &s;o incredible to 'em, that I &s;hall forbear to relate it; I do not &s;peak in heat, but &s;eriou&s;ly and calmly, that the Vomiting, tho' very frequent and &s;evere, was de&s;irable, if compared with the&s;e mo&s;t &s;trange Faintings, which were &s;o tor|menting
<PB N="33" REF="40">and in&s;upportable, that if I had been Stab'd or had had my Fle&s;h cut with Knives, I am certain I could much ea&s;ier have born it; I betook my &s;elf to moderate Riding again, and held out even under &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing Severities, as I have related, no le&s;s a time than a Year and Nine Months, when at length the&s;e Evils gained upon me, and my Vomit|ings were &s;o frequent and incredibly violent, that they took away the u&s;e of my Limbs, &s;o that I was forced to be lifted every time up|on my Hor&s;e, that I might continue my Ri|ding, tho' it were but to gain a little perio|dical Ea&s;e, till that &s;ei&s;ure on my Limbs in|crea&s;ing, I was confined to my Chamber, my Legs and Thighs &s;well'd, and I was very near the End of this tedious Journey of Life.'</P></Q>
<P>THE Account this Learned and Ingenious Phy&s;ician gives of his own dreadful Illne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by his wearing a Quick&s;ilver Girdle, together with the In&s;tances before given, of the Mi&s;chiefs that have been done by that Method, as al&s;o by Wa&s;hes and Ointments, are &s;uf|ficient, one would think, to deter all Per&s;ons from tampering with outward Medicines, for the Cure of Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es, without taking proper Internal Remedies al&s;o, by the Directi|on of a Skilful Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>AND here it will not be ami&s;s to exemplify the great danger of Quick&s;ilver Girdles, by another Ca&s;e that lately happen'd.</P>
<P>ON the 24th of <HI>May,</HI> an Ingenious Wo|man of very good Repute, in the utmo&s;t Fright
<PB N="34" REF="41">and Con&s;ternation (for which, indeed, &s;he had a great deal of Rea&s;on) de&s;ired my A&s;&s;i&s;tance; She gave me to under&s;tand, that &s;he had for &s;ome time before been troubled with the <HI>Itch,</HI> and for the Cure of it, had put on a Quick|&s;ilver Girdle, which, in a &s;hort time, rai&s;ed &s;uch a violent Salivation, as I &s;carcely ever &s;aw before; for be&s;ides the ordinary Symp|toms of &s;orene&s;s of the Mouth, exulceration of the Gums, &s;tinking Breath, loo&s;ne&s;s of the Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was attended with others very &s;evere and dangerous; particularly &s;uch a prodigious Inflammation and &s;welling of the Glandules about her Throat, that at fir&s;t, I que&s;tioned very much whether I &s;hould be able to &s;ave her Life; and I really believe if &s;he had not apply'd for Relief at the In&s;tant &s;he did, &s;he would in a little time have been &s;uf|focated or choak'd, and &s;o have peri&s;h'd by the effect of that pernicious Girdle.</P>
<P>I immediately endeavour'd to check the Salivation, and remove the Symptoms by <HI>Ca|tharticks,</HI> Specifick <HI>Ab&s;orbents, Cardiacks, Gar|gari&s;ms,</HI> and other proper Remedies, which, by God's Ble&s;&s;ing, had all the wi&s;h'd for Suc|ce&s;s, &s;av'd her from the Grave, and re&s;tor'd her to perfect Health.</P>
<P>THE narrow e&s;cape this Woman had, and what has been &s;aid before on this Head, will, I hope, prevent all Per&s;ons who happen to read the&s;e Papers, from making u&s;e of Mercurial or Quick&s;ilver Girdles, on any account what|ever.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="42">
<P>NEITHER is frequent Bleeding, or in a large quantity at a time, to be attempted without Danger; for it is certain, that irregu|lar Bleeding many times draws the pernicious Humour of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> from the Scarf-Skin, which alone was infected, into the Ma&s;s of Blood, and to the Internal and more Noble Parts, that before were not in the lea&s;t tainted with it.</P>
<P>SO likewi&s;e Purging imprudently with &s;trong Medicines, will have the &s;ame effect, and not often clear the External Parts of their trouble&s;ome defilement neither; many times it happens that Patients may Purge them&s;elves into the Grave, with the common violent <HI>Ca|tharticks,</HI> before their Skin will be freed from the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> and this <HI>Helmont</HI> well knew, and made a handle of it to de&s;pi&s;e Purging, in the manner before mentioned.</P>
<P>IF therefore Learned Phy&s;icians them&s;elves, who make the Body of Man, and all the De|fects and Di&s;tempers it is liable to, their con|tinual Study; and who are well acquainted with the Virtue, Nature and U&s;e of Medicines, which are keen In&s;truments in their Hands and which, when well apply'd, re&s;tore the Di|&s;ea&s;ed Body to pri&s;tine Health, but when im|properly pre&s;cribed, quite the contrary; if I &s;ay, &s;uch Eminent Men make fal&s;e &s;teps, as in the In&s;tances ju&s;t now given, and diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> from one another about the mo&s;t effectual Me|thod of curing the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> as already &s;hewn How &s;hould the Afflicted Patients, who mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>HAVING thus given the Opinion of Phy|&s;icians, concerning Bleeding, Purging, and Ex|ternal Applications in the Cure of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> and appri&s;ed the Reader of the Danger that attends the unskilful u&s;e of them, it may not be ami&s;s to offer my own Opinion concerning their true U&s;e, and then de&s;cribe the Method that to me appears mo&s;t Rational for the Cure of Cutaneous Di&s;tempers, and which Experi|ence has confirmed to be the Safe&s;t, Sure&s;t, and mo&s;t Expeditious to eradicate the <HI>Itch,</HI> Invete|rate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> when Curable.</P>
<P>FIRST then, as to Bleeding, it ought not promi&s;cuou&s;ly to be advi&s;ed to all Per&s;ons, nei|ther is it ab&s;olutely to be forborn; large or frequent Bleeding weakens the Patient, and, as already &s;aid, draws the Infection inwards, and often fixes it upon the habit of the Body, &s;o as to render it very difficult to Cure; but to omit Bleeding entirely, where a Patient is Young, and of a Plethorick Con&s;titution, and who&s;e Juices are apt to be much di&s;turbed, and whole Body di&s;ordered upon admini&s;tring Remedies, is certainly very erroneous; and that omi&s;&s;ion

<P>EXTREAMS the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">fore mu&s;t be avoided, and if a Fever is to be feared, Bleeding in a &s;mall quantity, may without Danger of at|tracting the foul Humour inwards, be premi&s;ed, in order to prevent all Accidents, but in my Opinion, for no other rea&s;on.</P>
<P>GENTLE Purging is always requi&s;ite for all Per&s;ons, who&s;e Circum&s;tances of Body will admit of it, &s;ome very few excepted; but the &s;trong common Purges mu&s;t be avoided, not only as too fatiguing to the Patient, but per|nicious al&s;o; for all <HI>Catharticks</HI> made u&s;e of in the&s;e Ca&s;es, ought to be very gentle, that &s;o Nature may not be oppre&s;&s;ed, but on the con|trary a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the offending Matter be car|ried off by a con&s;tant and ea&s;y Evacuation, by which the Patient will e&s;cape the Danger of drawing the Di&s;ea&s;y Humour to the Internal Parts, and of fixing it in the Blood and Juices, which violent Purges would expo&s;e him to.</P>
<P>PROPER External Applications are al&s;o exceeding nece&s;&s;ary to expedite the Cure, and to eradicate more certainly the foul Infection, and are very &s;afe to be u&s;ed, when gentle <HI>Ca|tharticks</HI> (with which <HI>Specificks</HI> mu&s;t ever be|mixed) are al&s;o inwardly given; but are very dangerous when u&s;ed unskilfully, alone, or without the nece&s;&s;ary Precautions.</P>
<P>IN the choice of External Applications <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> there is much Judgment required; for &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> are proper for one Per&s;on troubled with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="38" REF="45"><HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> may not be &s;o for another; yet in ge|neral they ought to be of a very &s;ubtile and pe|netrating Nature, that they may ea&s;ily enter the External Pores of the Skin, and be al&s;o en|dued with a Specifick Quality, to mortify or kill the pernicious &s;harp Humour lodged there|in, and likewi&s;e be adapted to enlarge the excretory Ducts, that there may be free per|&s;piration for the future, and that the excre|mentitious Salts combined with Sulphur, may no more be pent in, and by Stagnation acquire Acrimony, and &s;o cau&s;e Itching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SPECIFICK <HI>Alteratives, Diureticks</HI> and <HI>Sudorificks,</HI> are al&s;o often very u&s;eful to mend the Cra&s;is of the Blood, depurate the Juices, rectify the Glands, open the External Pores, and re&s;tore their Tone, and mu&s;t be pre&s;cri|bed as the Ca&s;e may require.</P>
<P>I might here give various Pre&s;criptions, of Remedies of every kind I have mentioned, from the Works of Learned and Eminent Phy|&s;icians, for the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y;</HI> but con&s;idering that the Judgment of a Skilful Man is always requi&s;ite for their right Appli|cation, even in the mo&s;t trifling <HI>Itch,</HI> and that tho' tho&s;e Pre&s;criptions might be excellent in their kind, and &s;hould fully an&s;wer the Cha|racter Authors have given of them; yet if Pa|tients &s;hould proceed on their own Heads, and unskilfully take or u&s;e them, they might prove very prejudicial, and in&s;tead of Curing their Di&s;ea&s;es, injure their Bodies, and perhaps en|danger
<PB N="39" REF="46">their Lives, I thought it be&s;t to omit them.</P>
<P>BUT the Method that I think mo&s;t proper to Cure the <HI>Itch,</HI> and other Chronick Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> In the fir&s;t place, if the Patient is Young, of a Sanguine Complexion, Plethorick, or inclined to a Fever, the Day before I order any Medicines, I direct to Bleed|ing in a &s;mall quantity, in order to prevent a Fever, or other acute Illne&s;s, and for no other end; but if no &s;uch Accident is to be feared, I omit Bleeding, and immediately advi&s;e to both Internal and External Remedies, to be taken and u&s;ed together.</P>
<P>THE External Medicines I direct to, cer|tainly clear the Skin from all manner of foulne&s;s, rendering it in a &s;hort time &s;mooth, fair, and entirely free from Itching, and from all Pim|ples, Scurf, Scabs, and other Defilements; whil&s;t the Internal ones, which are gently <HI>Purging, Diuretick,</HI> and <HI>Alterative,</HI> clean&s;e the Blood and Juices from Impurities, de&s;troy and carry off &s;harp Humours, and Acrid Particles, that may have intimately mixed with the Blood, and infected its whole Ma&s;s; break the Combinations of Saline and Sulphureous Cor|pu&s;cles, rectify the Glandules, free the Pores from ob&s;tructing Vi&s;co&s;ities, and effectually clear the whole Habit from all Filth and Putrefaction what&s;oever; and yet are &s;o ho|mogeneous to Nature, as not to cau&s;e any Sickne&s;s at Stomach, di&s;order of Body, or re|quire Confinement, more than barely to guard
<PB N="40" REF="47">again&s;t Wet Weather, or more than ordinary Cold.</P>
<P>NEITHER are the External Remedies I advi&s;e to, compounded with Brim&s;tone, or ac|companied with any nau&s;eous Smell, but may be u&s;ed by the mo&s;t delicate Per&s;on, without Offence, and yet are more effectual for the Intention than tho&s;e with which Brim&s;tone is mix'd: Now by this Method, and the Me|dicines I Order (which I always prepare my &s;elt, and which both External and Internal are different from the common Remedies) the Di&s;ea&s;y Matter, in what&s;oever Corner it lurks, will be ferreted out and entirely de&s;troyed, with &s;afety to the Patients, who will thereby be happily re&s;tored to their Pri&s;tine Health.</P>
<P>IT may here be enquired of me, why, &s;ince the External Medicines I &s;peak of, will effectu|ally clear the Skin from all Defilements, I do not rely on them for the Cure of a recent <HI>Itch,</HI> that has only infected the Scarf-Skin and not penetrated deeper, without advi&s;ing to Inter|nal Remedies? To which I an&s;wer, That no Man can be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;ome of the &s;ubtile Itchy Particles have not penetrated the &s;mall Blood Ve&s;&s;els, and if it &s;hould happen that they have, tho' the <HI>Itch,</HI> to all appearance might be cured, yet tho&s;e &s;mall Particles, that by getting into the Blood have e&s;caped being de|stroyed by the outward Remedies, will, by circulating about with it, &s;oon infect all the Fluids, and &s;o the <HI>Itch</HI> will break out again in a few Months after, and prove wor&s;e and
<PB N="41" REF="48">more &s;tubborn than before, as Per&s;ons without Number who have endeavoured to be cured that way, have experienced to their Co&s;t, and which, by taking proper Internals at the &s;ame time, might have been effectually prevented; be&s;ides, by admini&s;tring peculiar. Purging and Alterative Medicines, all Accidents and Di&s;tem|pers, that the u&s;ing of even the Safe&s;t outward Applications make the Patients liable to, as be|fore &s;hewn, are ab&s;olutely guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>IT may likewi&s;e be asked, why, If the In|ternal Remedies I direct to, are of &s;uch Effica|cy as I mention, I do not wholly depend upon them for the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin, without advi&s;ing to External Applications? To which it may be an&s;wered, That we ought to attack &s;uch &s;tubborn Di&s;tempers with all our force, and by all likely ways of &s;ucceeding; be&s;ides which, we cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for a Patient to be cured near &s;o &s;oon by Internal Medicines alone, as by them and External Applications together; the whole Ma&s;s of Blood and Juices will take up a con&s;i|derable time to be perfectly altered and purifi|ed, and much longer will it be, before the Di&s;|ea&s;y Particles lodged in the External Pores of the Skin, can by Internals alone, be ab&s;olutely overcome and de&s;troyed; but when with them we joyn proper outward Remedies, which are always &s;afe whil&s;t gentle <HI>Catharticks, &amp;c.</HI> are given inwardly, we then an&s;wer all the Intentions of Cure, and &s;trike home to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Morbifick Matter, &s;o as to de&s;troy it Root an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, may be ga|thered the Rea&s;ons why &s;o many Per&s;ons mi&s;s of being perfectly cured of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> for many Months, and oftentimes Years; for by u&s;ing outward Applications alone, tho' proper ones, the Cure even of a new caught <HI>Itch,</HI> is not often perfectly accompli&s;hed, and when it is, not without Danger; neither can Per&s;ons hand|&s;omely, I'm &s;ure not expeditiou&s;ly, be Cured by taking Internal Medicines, tho' exceeding good, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted with proper Externals at the &s;ame time; and to take and u&s;e Internal and External Remedies together, that are not very Efficacious (a misfortune often happening to Per&s;ons who follow the Vulgar Methods) is only trifling with the Di&s;temper and pro|longing their Affliction; for if they happen to be better, and &s;eem quite Cured, it is general|ly but for a &s;hort time, and the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;oon after breaks out again, with greater force than before.</P>
<P>MANY Per&s;ons have been thus fatigued with a &s;imple <HI>Itch,</HI> &s;ometimes for Years toge|ther, and at la&s;t ended their Days, by means of a &s;evere <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> or <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> when if at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ir&s;t they had been treated in a regular Me|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hod, with the mo&s;t effectual Medicines, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ight have been compleatly Cured, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n a few Days.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="50">
<P>TO the&s;e Rea&s;ons, why Per&s;ons mi&s;s of be|ing entirely cured, we may add, that tho&s;e afflicted with the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> are for the mo&s;t part a&s;hamed to own it, and al&s;o imagining, being otherwi&s;e well in Health, that the Di|&s;ea&s;e is but of &s;light Con&s;equence, and not at all Dangerous, they neglect to apply to a Skil|ful Phy&s;ician for their Cure, but follow the Advice of &s;ome good Woman or other, few of whom are without a Receipt of &s;ome Oint|ment, or other Medicine, which they really think will certainly Cure the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> or el&s;e they take or u&s;e Brim&s;tone, the vulgar Remedy, which, be&s;ides its Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s, often proves of dangerous Con&s;equence, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e Hectically inclined; and &s;o the Patients are very much fatigued, and many times ruined in&s;tead of being Cured.</P>
<P>NAY, that they are &s;ometimes kill'd out|right, by following the Advice of Women, and other unskilful Per&s;ons, is demon&s;trated by a deplorable Accident that happen'd but a few Years ago; for on the 15th of <HI>December,</HI> 1717. four young Men, Apprentices to Mr. <HI>Sluce,</HI> a Weaver in <HI>Old George-&s;treet Spittle-Fields,</HI> being pe&s;ter'd with the <HI>Itch,</HI> took each of them a Do&s;e of &s;ome pernicious Drug, that a Woman (Si&s;ter to one of the young Men) gave them, with an A&s;&s;urance that it would certainly Cure the <HI>Itch;</HI> and which it too &s;urely and unhappily did, by depriving every one of them of Life that very Day, to the great &s;urprize and Sor|row of their Friends, and un&s;peakable Grief and
<PB N="44" REF="51">di&s;tracting Terror of Mind of the unfortunate Woman who gave it them, and who, it &s;eems, was very far from de&s;igning 'em any Injury.</P>
<P>SOME People I have met with, who think to lightly of the <HI>Itch</HI> as to judge it a thing of nothing, a &s;light matter, &s;carcely worth mind|ing, and are &s;o very weak as to expect to be cured of it for a Trifle, and &s;eem frightned when they are told of being put into a regular Me|thod of Cure, that will come to more than Ten or Twenty Shillings Expence.</P>
<P>TO hear &s;uch Per&s;ons talk would almo&s;t provoke one to Laughter, were it not for the di&s;mal Effects that u&s;ually attend their Igno|rance; for I have ob&s;erved, that for the mo&s;t part it is this Cla&s;s of People who are &s;eldom cured of the <HI>Itch,</HI> but &s;uffer it in length of Time, to terminate in a foul <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> or loath|&s;ome <HI>Lepro&s;y;</HI> or if they are cured of the <HI>Itch</HI> by Brim&s;tone, Quick&s;ilver-Girdles, Ointments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to one or other of which they commonly have Recour&s;e, they are often precipitated into other dreadful Di&s;ea&s;es; in either of which Ca&s;es, they would then give above half they are worth in the World, to be re&s;tor'd to Health.</P>
<P>IT would be well therefore, if tho&s;e trou|bled with the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> would &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon the dangerous Con&s;equences I have men|tion'd, and con&s;ider, That it is not This or That Medicine (tho' ever &s;o good) that ought to be relied on; but that it is requi&s;ite to know when, and when not, it is proper. That the Habit of the Body, State of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and
<PB N="45" REF="52">other Circum&s;tances of the Patient, &s;hould be carefully con&s;idered: That the be&s;t Medicines often prove hurtful, when pre&s;cribed unskilfully, or at Random; and that therefore for Patients to proceed on their own Heads, or to follow the Advice of Women, or other unskilful Per&s;ons, is exceeding dangerous, may be attended with Di&s;|mal Con&s;equences, and perhaps co&s;t them their Lives, as the Examples before given, fully prove.</P>
<P>AMONG the many In&s;tances I could give of the taking and u&s;ing Brim&s;tone ineffectually, I &s;hall only trouble my Readers with the follow|ing, which are very remarkable.</P>
<P>A Country Gentleman happening in a Fa|mily who were all troubled with the <HI>Itch,</HI> was quickly infected with that Di&s;temper, which, as &s;oon as he precieved, he endeavoured to Cure by taking Brim&s;tone and Milk inwardly, and u&s;ing Brim&s;tone in an Ointment outwardly, in a very plentiful Manner, according to the vulgar Method, and for a longer Time than is cu&s;tomary, but to no purpo&s;e; for he de|clared to me, that his <HI>Itch</HI> continued upon him as vexatious and bad as ever.</P>
<P>HE then had the Opinion of &s;everal Phy&s;i|cians, one after another, and by their Advice took and u&s;ed abundance of Medicines, which, together with their Fees, co&s;t him a large Sum of Money; at la&s;t the Di&s;temper &s;eem'd to be conquer'd, and he thought him&s;elf perfectly cured, and in a &s;hort &s;pace of Time married; &s;oon after which, the <HI>Itch</HI> broke out again upon him to as great a degree as ever; nei|ther
<PB N="46" REF="53">did the New married Lady e&s;cape, but was as much pe&s;ter'd with that Di&s;temper as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AT that time he happened to meet with the fir&s;t Edition of this little Book, and after read|ing it, thought proper to put him&s;elf and Spou&s;e under my Care for Cure; and in a &s;hort time, by punctually following my Directions, they were both entirely freed from that tor|menting Di&s;ea&s;e, for which the Gentleman (who could neither be cured by Brim&s;tone, nor any of the Medicines he had before taken and u&s;ed) with abundance of Thanks, not only paid me to my Content, but al&s;o made me a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time the greate&s;t Joy and Satisfaction, for having been &s;o fortunate as to meet with my little Treati&s;e, which he &s;aid he would not but have &s;een for ever &s;o much, the reading of it having cau&s;ed him to apply to me, and be (as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay him&s;elf) &s;o &s;afely and ea&s;ily Cured; for he a&s;&s;ured me that what he had taken and u&s;ed before, by his Phy&s;ician's Pre|&s;criptions, (as well as the Brim&s;tone) was not only ineffectual, but very nau&s;eous, and withal exceeding co&s;tly.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Gentleman who lived not far from <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> apply'd to me very lately for the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> with which not only him&s;elf but his Son was very much afflicted; his Son, as the Gentleman inform'd me, had in vain gone through a very long and nau&s;eous Brim&s;tone Cour&s;e, had taken <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> Waters,
<PB N="47" REF="54">u&s;ed a Liquor which is publickly &s;old, and which the Author pretends will Cure the <HI>Itch</HI> without any other help, and had taken and u&s;ed many other things, but all to no pur|po&s;e; for which rea&s;on the Gentleman, finding the ill Succe&s;s his Son had, would try none of them him&s;elf, but came to me for Advice and Medicines, and as &s;oon as he was cured, &s;ent his Son to me al&s;o, whom I put into a regular Cour&s;e, and quickly di&s;charged perfectly well, to the entire Satisfaction of them both.</P>
<P>BRIMSTONE al&s;o, in the Cure of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> is attended with this further Incon|venience, that it obliges tho&s;e who take and u&s;e it, either to confine them&s;elves during the whole Cour&s;e, or el&s;e to let every one they come near, know they are troubled with the <HI>Itch;</HI> for the &s;mell of it is &s;o very &s;trong, as not to be overcome, or be concealed, from even tho&s;e who only ju&s;t pa&s;s by the Per&s;ons who u&s;e it, much le&s;s from them they conver&s;e with, to whom it &s;mells much more plain, &s;trong and filthy than to them&s;elves: And it is as natural for People to believe that tho&s;e who u&s;e Brim&s;tone, u&s;e it for the <HI>Itch,</HI> as it is for them to believe, that tho&s;e that &s;mell of it, u&s;e it.</P>
<P>AS to &s;uch as are a&s;hamed to own they are troubled with the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> and for that Rea|&s;on neglect to apply to a Phy&s;ician, or a Skil|ful Per&s;on, for Cure, they are certainly much in the wrong; for they may be a&s;&s;ured, that it is the Principle, as well as Intere&s;t of all
<PB N="48" REF="55">Phy&s;icians or Per&s;ons practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick, to keep private any Illne&s;s their Patients are de|&s;irous to conceal, and to direct to &s;uch Reme|dies as may be taken and u&s;ed privately, with|out the knowledge of any other Per&s;on, and without Confinement; as the Medicines I ad|vi&s;e to in &s;uch Ca&s;es mo&s;t certainly may, and &s;o as not to be di&s;cover'd, even by the neare&s;t Friend, tho' lying in the &s;ame Bed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit another Rea&s;on, why Per|&s;ons are often pe&s;tered with the <HI>Itch,</HI> every Three or Four Months, Spring and Fall, <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> That when by a proper Method they find them&s;elves tolerably well, and free from Itching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they grow weary of the trouble of taking and u&s;ing Medicines, and leave them off before the Di&s;ea&s;y Particles are wholly Eradicated, and thereby deceive them&s;elves; for if the lea&s;t part of the Itchy Infection hap|pens to remain in their Clothes, Gloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as &s;ometimes may happen even after Wa&s;hing, they then catch the Di&s;temper afre&s;h, which would be prevented by continuing the u&s;e of Remedies according to the Direction of a Skil|ful Man, for a rea&s;onable Time, that &s;o all the very Seeds of the Di&s;ea&s;e, either in their Bo|dies or Clothes, may be utterly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>AND for the better preventing all Danger of this kind, it is nece&s;&s;ary for the Patients, as &s;oon as the Itching and appearance of the Di&s;temper are taken off, to change their Clothes, Sheets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> immediately, and be very careful not to wear them again, till they are &s;ure,
<PB N="49" REF="56">by often boiling, wa&s;hing, and clean&s;ing, all the Itchy Particles that lodged in them, are entirely mortify'd and expung'd.</P>
<P>FOR want of due Care in this particular on|ly, abundance of Per&s;ons have been exceeding|ly fatigued with this hateful Di&s;ea&s;e, on and off, for many Months, and &s;ometimes Years together; of which I could give &s;everal Ex|amples that have happen'd within my own Knowledge, but &s;hall mention but one.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of Con&s;ideration came to me &s;ometime &s;ince, troubled with a &s;evere and univer&s;al <HI>Itch;</HI> upon enquiring how he had re|ceived the Infection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He told me he had been troubled with that Di&s;temper &s;ome Months before, but had been perfectly cured of it, and a&s;&s;ured me that he caught it again to that degree I &s;aw, only by his Servant giv|ing him, by Mi&s;take, a pair of Gloves to wear, that he remember'd afterwards to have worn, but once or twice at the mo&s;t, during the time he was pe&s;ter'd with the <HI>Itch.</HI> He added, that he kept them on his Hands &s;carce|ly an Hour, before he perceived the Mi&s;take, threw them away, and pre&s;ently wa&s;h'd and &s;cour'd his Hands two or three times, but all to no purpo&s;e; for the <HI>Itch</HI> &s;oon di&s;covered it &s;elf between his Fingers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from thence &s;pread all over his Body.</P>
<P>BY this Relation all Per&s;ons may perceive how very &s;ubtle, penetrating, and infecting the Itchy Particles are, that could lie &s;o long in a pair of Gloves, and afterwards &s;o &s;oon
<PB N="50" REF="57">and &s;o far in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the Skin, as not to be wa&s;h'd or &s;cour'd off, but to cau&s;e a very &s;evere, univer&s;al and &s;tubborn <HI>Itch.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Gentleman I put into a regular Me|thod of Cure, which &s;oon had the de&s;ired Effect, for which he hand&s;omely gratify'd me, and is at this Time perfectly well.</P>
<P>NOW by the Method I have advanced, the Directions I give, and the Medicines I have mentioned to u&s;e, (which, as before &s;aid, I always prepare my &s;elf, and which are not difficult to take, or to be apply'd, or in the lea&s;t fatiguing to the Patients) tho&s;e mi&s;erably afflicted with the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Hu|mours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> or <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> that are Curable, and even many that have been pronounced in|curable, may be certainly re&s;tored to Health in a rea&s;onable time, proportionably to the Stub|borne&s;s and Inveteracy of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>SO al&s;o Per&s;ons troubled with the <HI>King's-Evil,</HI> &s;tubborn <HI>Scrophulous Breakings out, Tu|mours, Running Ulcers,</HI> &amp;c. may, by the Me|thod I have propo&s;ed, be more a&s;&s;uredly and &s;ooner Cured, with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, than by any other whatever.</P>
<P>A few Remedies well adapted and rightly admini&s;ter'd, for a rea&s;onable time in all tho&s;e Ca&s;es, will generally take effect, without fa|tiguing the Patients with a va&s;t number of Me|dicines to nau&s;eate their Stomachs, and tire their Patience.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="58">
<P>BUT what hinders many People afflicted with the <HI>King's-Evil</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> from being Cured, is their want of &s;ufficient Re&s;olution to go through a regular Cour&s;e; for tho' they are put into one that is neither nau&s;eous trouble&s;ome, nor requiring Confinement; and tho' they &s;eem at fir&s;t re&s;olved to go thro' it and are convinced, that unle&s;s they do conti|nue it for a rea&s;onable time, they cannot be Cured; yet, which is &s;trange, they often &s;tag|ger in their Re&s;olution, grow weary they know not why, and many times leave off before they them&s;elves can &s;o much as expect Relief&punc; whereas if they would have &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to the Re&s;olution they fir&s;t took, they might in all human Probability, have been certainly Cured of their Di&s;temper, and been re&s;tor'd to perfect Health.</P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o many Per&s;ons, labouring under the la&s;t mentioned &s;tubborn Chronick Di&s;ea&s;es, who, dreading the uncertain Expence of a regular Cour&s;e of Medicines, are de&s;irous to enter into a Contract, to be Cured for a cer|tain Sum of Money. The&s;e &s;ort of People, in my Opinion, are the fitte&s;t in the World to fall into the Hands of &s;ome of our bold, daring Practitioners, who venture at all, and never fail to promi&s;e Wonders; for Patients of this kind, are apt to be plea&s;ed and taken with the po&s;itive A&s;&s;urances the&s;e Men give them, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> perfectly and infallibly Curing them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas a mode&s;t, faithful Phy&s;ician neither will, nor ought to undertake Patients in that
<PB N="52" REF="59">manner, but only de&s;ire a rea&s;onable Price for his Medicines, and &s;uitable Fees in Con&s;idera|tion of his Trouble, Advice, or Attendance; nei|ther will he give his Patients &s;uch po&s;itive A&s;|&s;urances of an infallible Cure, but be cautious in what he &s;ays, and only promi&s;e in the&s;e and all other difficult Ca&s;es, to endeavour to the utmo&s;t of his Power to Cure them; and for that End, put them into &s;uch a rational Cour&s;e of Medicine, as he really believes, and has found, to be mo&s;t effectual for &s;uch &s;tubborn Maladies, and from which Cour&s;e they, as well as he, may rea&s;onably, and in all likelihood, expect the de&s;ired Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is the only Method I take; and the Succe&s;s God has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s me with, in the Cure of the <HI>Itch,</HI> inveterate <HI>Itching Humours, Scabbine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> &amp;c. is very remarkable, and I believe can hardly be parallel'd; having, &s;ince I fir&s;t publi&s;hed this little Treati&s;e, di&s;charg|ed from under my Care great Numbers of Per|&s;ons, who apply'd to me for Cure of inveterate Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin, perfectly well, and who are, many of them, Men of the fir&s;t Rank, and of Eminent Learning and Parts, and had gone through many Cour&s;es of Phy&s;ick to no purpo&s;e, before they came to me; particularly one Gentle|man, a Divine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that had been unfortunately afflicted with a very foul <HI>Scabbine&s;s</HI> for &s;ome Years, and had ineffectually tried almo&s;t all Methods, whom I perfectly Cured in a very &s;hort time, (con&s;idering the invete|racy of the Di&s;ea&s;e) to his entire Satisfaction.</P>

<P>A little while ago a young Man about Se|venteen Years of Age, who was in a very bad Condition indeed, put him&s;elf under my Care for Cure; when he came to me, he was all over from Head to Foot &s;o full of red, angry, &s;ore Pimples, (which by turns al&s;o itched in|tolerably) that one could &s;carcely &s;tick a Pin between them; and his Arms and Legs were &s;o &s;ore and &s;tiff with them, that he had much ado to walk from the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> to my
<PB N="54" REF="61">Hou&s;e; he told me his Mother had been &s;o before him, and &s;uppo&s;ed he had it from her Hereditarily; the Apothecary, who is made u&s;e of by the Family he lives with, had done all he could for him, without his receiving the lea&s;t Benefit; this young Man I put into a regular ea&s;y Cour&s;e, which, thro' God's Mer|cy, had the de&s;ired Effect, and he was perfectly Cured in &s;uch a &s;hort time, that him&s;elf and Friends admired at it; &s;ome time after he had paid me, and I had di&s;charg'd him, he came unexpectedly and full of Joy, to return me Thanks for my Care of him, and at the &s;ame time &s;hewed his Gratitude, by making me a &s;mall Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I could give many more Examples of ex|traordinary Ca&s;es that I have met with, and have had Succe&s;s in, but think tho&s;e I have already given, &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I cannot here conclude, without taking No|tice, of the Ab&s;urdity of &s;ome Practitioners, who confine them&s;eves to one Sett of Medicines, which they give to all Per&s;ons troubled with the Di&s;tempers I have treated about, and which they think will an&s;wer the End, in People of all Habits, Ages and Con&s;titutions; which undoubtedly is altogether again&s;t Rea&s;on, and needs no further Confutation.</P>
<P>I find my &s;elf often obliged to vary my Me|dicines, according to the State of the Di&s;ea&s;e, Habit of the Body, and other Circum&s;tances of the Patient, tho' generally &s;peaking, the Method I take (except in &s;ome extraordinary
<PB N="55" REF="62">Ca&s;es, in which a <HI>Cardiack</HI> and <HI>Sudorifick</HI> Cour&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be required, and where Di|&s;ea&s;es of the Skin are complicated with other Illne&s;&s;es) is one and the &s;ame, tho' the Medi|cines may be different.</P>
<P>AND even for a Con&s;ideration of le&s;s mo|ment than that of Health, <HI>viz.</HI> for conveni|ency of the Patient, it is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to change the External Remedies; as for Ex|ample, In&s;tead of ordering Ointments outward|ly, I have been obliged for the &s;ake of nice Per&s;ons, who were utterly again&s;t u&s;ing any thing daubing, or that would appear upon their Linnen, to prepare a Liquor as clear as fair Water, and of a plea&s;ant Scent, to be u&s;ed externally for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and which will certainly have the &s;ame good Effect; it being a delicate Medicine, very Efficacious, and not to be &s;een after u&s;ing, either upon the Skin, or Linnen, only being a difficult Preparation, is &s;omewhat more expen&s;ive to the Patient than many other Applications.</P>
<P>FROM this &s;hort Account of Cutaneous Di&s;ea&s;es, I hope my Readers, at lea&s;t the un|prejudiced part of them, will be convinced, that the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> may be ea&s;ily and &s;afely Cured, without the u&s;e of Brim&s;tone, Confine|ment of the Patient, or knowledge of other Per&s;ons; for that there are other Remedies much plea&s;anter, and more effectual than Brim|&s;tone (which be&s;ides its nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s, often|times will not Cure; but on the contrary, when taken and u&s;ed by Hectical Per&s;ons, proves
<PB N="56" REF="63">very injurious) is mo&s;t certain, &s;ince Expe|rience vouches for it; and that Patients may be Cured of the <HI>Itch, &amp;c.</HI> without more than ordinary Confinement, is as true, &s;ince the Evacuating Remedies I have found nece&s;&s;ary, and make u&s;e of, are &s;o very gentle, that tho&s;e who take them may go Abroad about their Bu|&s;ine&s;s, without any Di&s;order, or further Ob&s;er|vation, than only not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to wet Weather, or to extraordinary Cold; and al&s;o that Patients may be Cured without the knowledge of other Per&s;ons, is very plain, be|cau&s;e the External Medicines I advi&s;e to, may be u&s;ed privately, and as they have not any ill Scent, they can by no means be di&s;covered.</P>
