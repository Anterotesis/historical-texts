<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF we read with attention the hi&s;tories of grand remedies, we &s;ee, their effi|cacy was ever warmly di&s;puted, at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P>There were phy&s;icians, who immedi|ately condemned them, and pro&s;cribed them as hurtful.</P>
<P>But others, upon different experiments, prai&s;ed and commended them, as mo&s;t &s;alutary.</P>
<P>By the&s;e learned di&s;putes the thing was at la&s;t rightly determined, and applied to common u&s;e.</P>
<P>I plainly fore&s;ee, the &s;ame will happen to HEMLOCK.</P>
<P>But in the mean time I am very &s;orry, to &s;ee &s;ome medical people, of great rank, give a premature and har&s;h &s;entence a|gain&s;t <HI>hemlock;</HI> and to condemn it, and to di&s;&s;uade others from it, as a poi&s;onous and u&s;ele&s;s plant.</P>
<P>This &s;avours of too great a de&s;ire of contradiction; and is repugnant to all rea|&s;on in medicine.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
<P>But the mo&s;t cruel thing that has hap|pened to me, is, to find tho&s;e to be my enemies, whom I always treated with the greate&s;t re&s;pect; to whom I have done all manner of good offices; and who&s;e duty it rather was, to take my part, than to hurt me.</P>
<P>But I am neither concerned at that, nor thir&s;t after revenge. And that the&s;e my adver&s;aries may acknowledge, I am no ways di&s;affected to them on that ac|count, although I may differ in opinion; I write the&s;e ob&s;ervations for their ho|nour; offer and dedicate them, with all due re&s;pect, to them.</P>
<P>Bur I do not by any means de&s;ire, that they &s;hould &s;hew me any favour. Let them only love the truth; act like ju&s;t judges; and ingenuou&s;ly own, whatever is for the good of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>As for the idle clamours of &s;ome, I am indifferent about them, and de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Whoever dreads the rattling of leaves, let him avoid a wood.</P>

<PB REF="4">
<HEAD>A NECESSARY SUPPLEMENT UPON HEMLOCK.</HEAD>
<P>I Have already &s;hewn, and confirmed, in two former volumes, the virtue and efficacy there is in <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>For that rea&s;on there was no occa&s;ion, that I &s;hould write any thing more on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But as there are &s;till many, who do not rightly conceive my notions about <HI>hemlock;</HI> and doubt its <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> and cha|racter; it was nece&s;&s;ary to give a figure of the plant.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<P>And that this might be rightly done, and made clear and plain to every one, without any danger of error, I entreated Dr. <HI>Crantz,</HI> the famous and indefati|gable Profe&s;&s;or of the In&s;titutions of Me|dicine, and of the <HI>materia medica,</HI> to bring this plant into his botanical garden, and to take care to have it well deline|ated.</P>
<P>This he did willingly, and gave me this table, drawn and engraved by the learned Mr. <HI>Cipps,</HI> a candidate in phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>From this any one, the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in botany, may know the plant at fir&s;t &s;ight, and di&s;tingui&s;h it from all others.</P>
<P>But as for the extract of it, it is not every where prepared to my mind. For they take a large quantity of the expre&s;&s;ed juice, which they boil in a copper ve&s;&s;el, on a fierce fire; whence ari&s;es a &s;trong fetid &s;team, which is the be&s;t part of the medicine, that flies off: and be&s;ides, they do not take proper care to purify the juice and extract.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means is prepared a black ma&s;s, that is tough, and with little of the genuine fetid flavour.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>But when it is prepared in my way, it ought to be a thick extract, of a dark greeni&s;h colour, with a mo&s;t ungrateful fetid flavour, much like the &s;mell of mice.</P>
<P>Some have mixed other herbs with <HI>hemlock,</HI> and &s;ome leave the herb fre&s;h gathered in a heap for &s;everal days, by which it grows flaccid; part of it cor|rupts; and the juice grows roapy and &s;limy.</P>
<P>Others do not boil the juice as &s;oon as it is expre&s;&s;ed, but wait for a day or two, till they have lei&s;ure; by which the juice changes, and lo&s;es its virtue.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion I thought it would not be improper, to give an account of &s;ome cures, that I have made with <HI>hem|lock</HI> alone, &s;ince my &s;econd treati&s;e on that &s;ubject was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In doing this I &s;hall be &s;hort, that I may not interrupt the lei&s;ure, or con&s;ume the time, that is &s;o precious to phy&s;i|cians, by tedious narrations.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay I gave <HI>hemlock,</HI> I mean its extract; which I take notice of, that there may be no di&s;pute about words.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<P>Nor have I always added the do&s;e of the medicine; becau&s;e I have almo&s;t al|ways begun with a &s;mall quantity, and gradually encrea&s;ed it, till a good effect en&s;ued: then I &s;topped, and never in|crea&s;ed the do&s;e afterwards.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of about thirty years of age, complained, for &s;everal months, of a violent pain, and continual heat, in his belly: he had no appetite; the urine flowed as in a &s;trangury; his &s;tools were frequent, &s;mall, hot, joined with a <HI>tene&s;|mus;</HI> the complexion pale, and the whole body emaciated.</P>
<P>Remedies of every kind were tried, but did no &s;ervice : &s;leep was rather di&s;turbed, and his &s;trength began to fail.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK alone gave him relief in the &s;pace of three months: his appetite returned; the &s;tools became natural; his urine was made freely; he gained &s;trength, and a perfect &s;tate of health.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="8">
<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>A Youth of fifteen had a tumor for three months, of the &s;ize of a wal|nut, on his left cheek.</P>
<P>A <HI>fi&s;tula,</HI> weeping an <HI>ichor,</HI> penetrated into this tumor.</P>
<P>The phy&s;icians and chirurgeons had here tried their art for a long time to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But upon giving <HI>hemlock,</HI> the tumor di&s;appeared; the <HI>fi&s;tula</HI> clo&s;ed; and all his pains cea&s;ed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, forty-odd years old, had a very bad &s;preading tetter or ringworm <HI>(&s;erpiginem)</HI> on her hand, above a twelve|month, &s;o that the &s;kin was cracked to the fle&s;h in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>Neither external remedies, nor inter|nal purges, and &s;weetners of the blood, gave any relief.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK cured her within two months.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="case study">
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, pa&s;t thirty, perceived a <HI>&s;cir|rhus</HI> of a large &s;ize in her right-brea&s;t, for &s;everal months.</P>
<P>A pla&s;ter was applied, by which both the hardne&s;s and &s;ize of the brea&s;t were encrea&s;ed, and the &s;welling &s;pread under the arm-pit.</P>
<P>The tumor became of a purple co|lour, with here and there livid &s;treaks, and the pain &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that &s;he could neither &s;leep day nor night.</P>
<P>At length &s;everal knots or tubercles ro&s;e on the tumor, which threatened a very bad exulceration.</P>
<P>I being called in, de&s;ired that &s;he would lay a&s;ide all kind of pla&s;ters, and cover the brea&s;t only with a &s;oft linen cloth.</P>
<P>Internally I gave only the extract of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;pace of eight days the pain almo&s;t entirely cea&s;ed; the colour of the tumor changed; and the tubercles &s;ub|&s;ided.</P>
<P>In nine weeks the brea&s;t came to its natural &s;tate.</P>

<P>The greate&s;t do&s;e was half a drachm a day.</P>

<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, of twenty-&s;even years of age, throwed up every thing &s;he &s;wal|lowed for three and twenty weeks, and was almo&s;t con&s;umed by it.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians, chirurgeons, quacks, and old women, had tried all their &s;kill, with|out any amendment of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>I ordered twenty grains of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> in a mixture of four ounces; of which &s;he took a &s;poonful every two hours; and in a &s;hort time the vomiting cea&s;ed; &s;he recovered her appetite, and her &s;trength.</P>
<P>And it is now three months, &s;ince any &s;igns of the vomiting have returned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of &s;eventy had an ulcer in his arm for five years: a &s;harp humor that weeped out of it continually fretted
<PB N="8" REF="11">the parts adjacent, and excited burning pu&s;tules.</P>
<P>The remedies that were applied anon relieved the di&s;order, but the itching &s;oon returned, with a fretting of the cuticle; and the ulcer began to weep a mo&s;t &s;harp humor.</P>
<P>The patient then took, by my advice, &s;ix grains of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> every morning, and as many every evening, for five weeks: outwardly was applied the pla&s;ter of <HI>diapompholyx:</HI> and now in &s;ix months the ulcer is quite healed, and the old man enjoys perfect health.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE VII.</HEAD>
<P>A Noble old lady had both her brea&s;ts large and &s;cirrhous.</P>
<P>A pla&s;ter irritated the di&s;order, and brought on great pain.</P>
<P>The nipple of the right-brea&s;t was twice as large as u&s;ual, ulcerated, and continually weeped a &s;harp, corro&s;ive ichor. The tumor had &s;pread under the arm-pits.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<P>The good old lady could hardly &s;peak, much le&s;s laugh, or breathe freely, through pain.</P>
<P>The taking of <HI>hemlock</HI> immediately amended the di&s;order; the nipple was reduced to its natural &s;ize in four weeks; and in four months both brea&s;ts were cured.</P>
<P>There was no occa&s;ion to increa&s;e the do&s;e above eighteen grains a day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Man, about thirty, had a tumor larger than a man's fi&s;t, for a long time, on the right &s;ide of his neck.</P>
<P>He was, be&s;ides, cachectic; and com|plained of violent pains, all over his body, and in all his limbs; which tor|mented him night and day.</P>
<P>The&s;e complaints le&s;&s;ened his appe|tite; he wa&s;ted away; and looked ill, of a dark yellow complexion.</P>
<P>Whatever remedies he took were of no &s;ervice.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as he con&s;ulted me, I gave him, <HI>hemlock;</HI> by which in a few

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE IX.</HEAD>
<P>A Woman, of thirty &s;ix years of age, laboured under malignant ul|cers, for two years; which had eat into the tip of the no&s;e, the no&s;trils, and the whole upper lip; &s;o as to ren|der the whole vi&s;age a mo&s;t frightful &s;ight.</P>
<P>All the&s;e parts were livid, hard, &s;welled; and violent pain deprived the mi&s;erable object of re&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;harp thin humor, continually weeping, corroded the adjacent parts.</P>
<P>Purges, anti&s;corbutics, mercurials, &s;weetners of the blood, made no alter|ation; if it were not, that the di&s;|order &s;eemed to grow much wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the taking of <HI>hemlock,</HI> a copious ichor, but much milder, was di&s;charged; and immediately the &s;welling of all the parts fell; the pain cea&s;ed; and the livid colour was changed to a na|tural one.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<P>In three weeks time a great change was ob&s;erved for the better; and the patient grew much &s;tronger, and plump.</P>

<P>But as &s;oon as &s;he began to u&s;e <HI>hemlock</HI> again, all the bad &s;ymptoms went off: and by a continued u&s;e of it for &s;ix weeks the ulcers were cicatri&s;ed; and the &s;welling di&s;appeared.</P>

<P>Neither baths, nor medicines, which &s;he had taken for &s;ix years, had any effect on her di&s;order.</P>

<P>Antivenereal remedies, that are other|wi&s;e the be&s;t in the&s;e ca&s;es, increa&s;ed the di&s;order; &s;o that a con&s;umption was feared.</P>

<P>HEMLOCK cures the di&s;ea&s;es, that en|&s;ue after a malignant &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>To confirm this, Dr. <HI>Lebmacker,</HI> an eminent phy&s;ician of this city, wrote me the two following hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the hi&s;tory of his own &s;on, which was thus:</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>'My &s;on, an infant five months old, otherwi&s;e in perfect health, was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox on the
<PB N="28" REF="31">26th of February, 1760; which, al|though di&s;tinct, was not of &s;o good a kind.</P>
<P>On the ninth day of the di&s;ea&s;e a &s;ud|den diarrhoea came on, whence all the pu&s;tules on the left-&s;ide from head to foot &s;unk in, while tho&s;e on the right-&s;ide remained full.</P>
<P>On this the left-arm, knee, and foot &s;welled to an enormous &s;ize, with great pain and inability; which the poor in|fant made us &s;en&s;ible of by its &s;hrieks, if it was touched.</P>
<P>No aperture could be made in the&s;e tumors, either by nature or art; but they were cured in four months time by the &s;kill of an expert chirurgeon, Mr. <HI>Le|ber,</HI> without any impediment in the ac|tion of the parts.</P>
<P>But as the cro&s;s child could not be prevailed upon to take any medicine, either in the time of the &s;mall-pox, or thereafter; and his mother's milk, with a milk diet, were not &s;ufficient to a&s;|&s;uage the virulence of the variolous matter, his whole body was in time covered with innumerable ugly ichorous
<PB N="29" REF="32">ulcers, from the crown of the head to the &s;oles of the feet; &s;o that he had no|thing but a &s;welled belly, and ulcerated &s;kin, to cover the bones.</P>
<P>The child being thus left in this de|plorable condition, till it was one and twenty months old, that is, till June 1761, all hopes of its recovery were over, as it grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day. I was willing, however, to try, what the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> given as we could, might do in &s;uch a ca&s;e.</P>
<P>From the beginning of June, then, I gave him daily two grains, one in the morning, in a weak decoction of coffee and toa&s;ted barley, with milk; and ano|ther in the evening, in chocolate, that he might not di&s;cern it.</P>
<P>I &s;o increa&s;ed the do&s;e by degrees, that he took daily &s;ix grains, without any regard to his diet.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the ulcers began to afford a good <HI>pus,</HI> to be clean&s;ed, to heal up, and to di&s;appear over the whole body; only a &s;cab or two remaining among the hair of his head.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="33">
<P>By the middle of July he had got &s;o much &s;trength, that he could run up and down very bri&s;kly, both within doors and without, with his head up|right, and his eyes clear and open; nei|ther fearing the rays of the &s;un, nor a candle, which he could not bear for two months before, on account of his inflamed eyes, which made him hang his head, and put his hands to his eyes, whenever any light came before them.</P>
<P>Thus by degrees the child, that was before intolerably cro&s;s, now runs about all day with chearfulne&s;s at his play.'</P></Q>
<P>He took &s;ix drachms of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> but no other medicine.</P>
<P>Now, my good readers! if we had only this &s;ingle ca&s;e to vouch it, would not <HI>hemlock</HI> de&s;erve the greate&s;t prai&s;e?</P>
<P>HEMLOCK was given to an infant quite extenuated, covered with ulcers, and in the wor&s;t cachectic habit of body, of which he was cured.</P>
<P>HEMLOCK then is an innocent reme|dy, and it is an efficacious one.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, &s;ome terrible cal|culators in medicine, who will, perhaps,
<PB N="31" REF="34">attribute this cure, to the decoction of toa&s;ted barley, infu&s;ion of coffee, choco|late, or to the force of nature.</P>
<P>But they mu&s;t know, that this child took tho&s;e drinks before he u&s;ed the <HI>hem|lock,</HI> but grew wor&s;e upon it: &s;o that we can neither attribute his recovery to the force of nature, nor to this drink. But as &s;oon as the extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> was given, the infant began to grow better.</P>
<P>Whence, O <HI>hemlock!</HI> the prai&s;e is due to thee.</P>
<P>The &s;econd hi&s;tory is the following one, communicated to me by the &s;ame learned gentleman.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>'About the end of June, 1761, I met by chance a certain noble lady of three and twenty, who had been afflicted with the confluent &s;mall-pox eighteen years before, the &s;ad remains of which &s;he &s;till bewails; for be&s;ides the lo&s;s of her right eye, &s;he had an ulcer, with a hard &s;welling, on her right cheek</P>
<P>Various remedies, as &s;he &s;aid, both internal and external, had been tried to heal this &s;ore; but they were all, even to a &s;alivation it&s;elf, given in vain.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="35">
<P>Remembring the &s;ucce&s;s of the ex|tract of <HI>hemlock</HI> in a like di&s;ea&s;e, I ad|vi&s;ed the &s;ame to her.</P>
<P>Altho' &s;he was now tired of medi|cines, yet &s;he con&s;ented to it.</P>
<P>She began then, on the fir&s;t of July, to take every day eight grains of the ex|tract of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>Taking off the pla&s;ter, of what kind I know not, I took care to have the ul|cer fomented with a linen-cloth, dipt in a decoction of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>In eight days the tumors appeared to be both le&s;s, and &s;ofter; and there &s;eemed to be &s;ome &s;light tokens of a ci|catrix forming on the lips of the ulcer.</P>
<P>In the mean time, proud fle&s;h &s;prung up here and there in the mid|dle of the ulcer; which was taken off by &s;prinkling the powder of <HI>hemlock</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>The cru&s;t occa&s;ioned by this, I took off with honey of ro&s;es, mixed with the &s;ame powder: which were repeated, as often as the proud fle&s;h &s;prang up again.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="36">
<P>In the mean time I increa&s;ed the pills, &s;o that for three weeks pa&s;t &s;he has taken every day thirty two grains.</P>
<P>This do&s;e I have hitherto continued, intermitting now and then a day or two.</P>
<P>About this time, the tumors, and hardne&s;s, almo&s;t entirely went off; the ulcer began to be clean&s;ed, to be dried up, and to be covered with a thin &s;kin; and thus it has remained clo&s;ed now for &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>She will go on with the &s;ame do&s;e of <HI>hemlock,</HI> till the cicatrix is &s;ound.</P>
<P>She has now taken, from the begin|ning of June to the end of September, four ounces of the extract of <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>She received no benefit from any other medicine for eighteen years.</P>
<P>But now, by the u&s;e of <HI>hemlock,</HI> &s;he finds her appetite to be increa&s;ed; &s;he grows plump; is free from rheumatic pains, which &s;he was before troubled with; and has no other complaint.'</P></Q>
<P>Is there any man in his &s;en&s;es who doubts of the efficacy of <HI>hemlock?</HI></P>
<P>Since <HI>hemlock</HI> operates on the virulent
<PB N="34" REF="37">remains of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> a que&s;tion a|ri&s;es upon it; whether it may not be al|lowable to give it, in a malignant vario|lous di&s;temper it&s;elf, in a &s;pare do&s;e, by a prudent hand, with judicious and pro|vident care? it is agreeable to nature, and appears from an infinite cour&s;e of experi|ence, that vegetables of whatever kind may be dige&s;ted in our &s;tomachs, and converted into the inquiline juices of the body; but minerals cannot.</P>
<P>VEGETABLES, <HI>then, are more ea&s;ily borne by our nature, and are by far more &s;afe and agreeable to it.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore if it was allowable to others to u&s;e <HI>mercury,</HI> and antimony, in a viru|lent &s;tate of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> why may not we be allowed, without any remor&s;e, to try <HI>hemlock,</HI> &s;ince the be&s;t remedies yet known do nothing; the&s;e two ca&s;es of the learned <HI>Lebmacher</HI> were very nece&s;&s;a|ry here, to make this propo&s;ition appear worthy of approbation.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e, from other phy&s;icians both of this and foreign countries, &s;ome excellent ca&s;es relating to <HI>hemlock,</HI> in which it proved &s;ucce&s;sful: and I have
<PB N="35" REF="38">others, in which it did not &s;ucceed &s;o well; but I have thought proper to re&s;erve all the&s;e for another time.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ADMONITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Corollaries are deduced from, and confirmed by, repeated experi|ence.</P>
<P>But I be&s;eech all, and every phy&s;icians, not to per&s;uade them&s;elves, that I am of &s;uch an opinion as to believe, that the&s;e rules are general, and that <HI>hemlock</HI> ought always to cure.</P>
<P>I &s;ay and openly own, that I have like|wi&s;e had patients of all kinds, to whom <HI>hemlock</HI> was of no &s;ervice; altho' it was indicated from a &s;imilitude of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But I do not believe, there are any, who will doubt of the truth of the ca&s;es I have related.</P>
<P>But if any one makes a &s;cruple about the truth of the matter, and &s;u&s;pects my probity, let him go to the <HI>illu&s;trious Van Swieten;</HI> who has the names of the pati|ents, and an account of their place of abode.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="39">
<P>Happy me! who have an opportunity to practice phy&s;ic under the au&s;pices of &s;o <HI>great a man.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een patients labouring under the wor&s;t <HI>cancer</HI> of the brea&s;t, whom <HI>hemlock</HI> &s;oon relieved: but there were &s;everal others, to whom <HI>hemlock</HI> only afforded &s;ome relief, but did not cure them: others found no alteration from the u&s;e of <HI>hem|lock:</HI> one or two could not bear <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>I would have the &s;ame to be under&s;tood of other di&s;ea&s;es, for which I have com|mended <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>For I only contend, that <HI>hemlock</HI> is &s;ometimes of &s;ervice, and does wonders, where other the mo&s;t famous and extol|led medicines do nothing.</P>
<P>If other phy&s;icians &s;till find other reme|dies, we may be able, in time, to cure the mo&s;t difficult di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Truly! I congratulate my&s;elf, when I hear, there are &s;everal phy&s;icians, who follow my example about divers vegeta|bles.</P>
<P>How many thou&s;ands of plants are there, who&s;e virtues we are ignorant of? But to di&s;cover the&s;e, there are required
<PB N="37" REF="40">indu&s;try, labor, provident care, and a mind free from all &s;ects.</P>
<P>Neither &s;hould you &s;wear by the dic|tates of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is always to be remem|bered, that there are limites both to art and medicines.</P>
<P>Now when <HI>hemlock</HI> is &s;ometimes of &s;ervice, but at other times does nothing in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; it is certain there mu&s;t be &s;ome latent difference, the diag|no&s;tic &s;igns of which are yet unknown to us; nor am I alone &s;ufficient to determine tho&s;e things; and for that rea&s;on I have not hitherto been able, to give any cer|tain rules.</P>
<P>But they who might and ought to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. Yea they have even, by &s;harp cen&s;ures, and repeated harangues to the &s;ons of art, condemned and pro&s;cribed my works, and would have them de&s;troyed by fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>Ah me! mi&s;erable fate of man.</P>
<P>In my two treati&s;es on <HI>hemlock,</HI> I have related both the ca&s;es that were &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and tho&s;e that proved un&s;ucce&s;sful:
<PB N="38" REF="41">and moreover I always admoni&s;hed, that <HI>hemlock</HI> would not prove of equal &s;ervice to all: I &s;aid farther, in my &s;econd book, it was enough to me, if I &s;hall pre&s;erve and cure one patient in a hundred by the u&s;e of <HI>hemlock,</HI> who could not be re&s;tored by other medicines.</P>
<P>If every one of the other ninety-nine phy&s;icians will do as much as I have done, then all the hundred patients will be cured.</P>
<P>Could any man write with more &s;in|cerity and hone&s;ty? It is allowable to propo&s;e our experiments faithfully and cautiou&s;ly to the world: but after that every phy&s;ician is at liberty, to u&s;e &s;uch a remedy, or to let it alone.</P>
<P>I neither de&s;ire honor, glory, immortal fame, nor profit: I would only de&s;ire to be u&s;eful to mankind, afflicted with &s;o many mi&s;erable di&s;tempers; and would be willing to relieve &s;uch calamities. This is the duty of every phy&s;ician; I beg, then, that others would give me no di&s;|turbance.</P>
<P>I have given to the &s;ick &s;ome hundred pounds of the extract of <HI>hemlock,</HI> and can
<PB N="39" REF="42">affirm, with a &s;afe con&s;cience, that I ne|ver hurt any one. For when I &s;aw things to be in a right way, I went on boldly, continued, and increa&s;ed the do&s;e: but as &s;oon as I ob&s;erved (which very rarely happens) that the &s;ick did not do well from it, I forbore, and laid a&s;ide <HI>hemlock.</HI> This is the rule of art.</P>
<P>Since then this medicine prudently given cannot hurt, our art requires, that it &s;hould be farther recommended to all; in order to make numbers of trials, which may be collated together, and compared according to their &s;igns, &s;ymptoms, and events. Then let the rea&s;ons and cau&s;es be inquired into, why <HI>hemlock</HI> is &s;ome|times of &s;ervice, and makes a radical cure; and why it &s;ometimes does nothing in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon &s;eeing the difference, and find|ing out the cau&s;e, it will appear, how far the efficacy of <HI>hemlock</HI> may extend. And then a rea&s;on may be given, why <HI>hemlock</HI> does not act equally upon all. It may then likewi&s;e be determined, with what ca&s;es it evidently agrees; and in what it performs nothing.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43">
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations being rightly di|ge&s;ted, we may be able to apply &s;ome other remedy, in ca&s;es where <HI>hemlock</HI> is inactive.</P>
<P>By &s;uch means the bounds of our art will be extended, to the great benefit of the community.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, where <HI>hemlock</HI> had not the effects I expected from it, I have tried other remedies; and not without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>If that was not &s;ufficient, I have ano|ther ready.</P>
<P>Thus I &s;hall a&s;cend by degrees; and I hope in God, that he will pro&s;per my endeavours, which are only intended for the welfare of my neighbours.</P>
<P>I here faithfully promi&s;e my adver|&s;aries, I &s;hall employ the more pains upon tho&s;e things, the more they endeavour to interrupt and hinder me.</P>
<P>While I do what is right, I fear no body.</P>
<P>Although <HI>hemlock</HI> is a mo&s;t innocent remedy, yet I could wi&s;h, that every phy&s;ician would always begin with a &s;mall do&s;e, and gradually increa&s;e it.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="44">
<P>For we know, how &s;trange and diver&s;e the peculiar temperaments of men are; whence there may be &s;ome, who may not bear this remedy.</P>
<P>By a &s;mall do&s;e then, no one will com|mit a fault: becau&s;e a good phy&s;ician will di&s;continue a medicine, where he ob&s;erves any &s;ini&s;ter event.</P>
<P>But it is always to be well ob&s;erved, whether that event may be owing to the medicine; or to the &s;ymptoms that ac|company the di&s;ea&s;e; or to an error in the non-naturals.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who are tormented, vomit, are &s;eized with a fever, and faint away, only from taking crabs eyes, which are certainly a mo&s;t innocent medicine: and why &s;hould there not be others, who, from &s;ome latent cau&s;e, may be ill affect|ed with <HI>hemlock?</HI></P>
<P>But is <HI>hemlock</HI> therefore no medicine? Ought <HI>hemlock</HI> to be condemned on that account? No prudent phy&s;ician will think &s;o.</P>
<P>If the u&s;e of <HI>hemlock</HI> proves prejudicial to any, it is not to be attributed to the medicine, but to the fault of the pre|&s;criber;
<PB N="42" REF="45">if we take the thing in a &s;trict, and true medical &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Symptoms of a different nature from the di&s;ea&s;e are often complicated with it: and then it is requi&s;ite, that other reme|dies &s;hould be applied, be&s;ides <HI>hemlock.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;pa&s;ms or convul&s;ions prove trouble|&s;ome, antihy&s;teric nervine remedies are wanted.</P>
<P>If pains are violent, paregorics and opiates become nece&s;&s;ary. A high fever, and full pul&s;e, require cooling nitrous remedies.</P>
<P>In a putrid &s;tate of the juices, or if an intermittent fever comes upon the u&s;e of <HI>hemlock,</HI> the bark is added to it.</P>
<P>Sometimes purging is needful, &s;ome|times bleeding.</P>
<P>Too great a flow of &s;harp humours on a part requires an i&s;&s;ue, or &s;eton.</P>
<P>Neither ought a fomentation or cata|pla&s;m of <HI>hemlock</HI> always to be applied outwardly; but they are to be changed, according to the judgment and experience of a good phy&s;ician, or chirurgeon.</P>
<P>If ulcers are dre&s;t with lint, great care &s;hould be u&s;ed in taking it off; le&s;t the
<PB N="43" REF="46">threads adhering to the naked ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be torn off with force, which might hurt every thing: a haemorrhage might en&s;ue, from which proud fle&s;h, &s;prings up.</P>
<P>They &s;hould all be fir&s;t moi&s;tened with the weake&s;t infu&s;ion of <HI>hemlock,</HI> or other proper liquid.</P>
<P>The more urging &s;ymptoms often de|mand, that the u&s;e of <HI>hemlock,</HI> both ex|ternal and internal, &s;hould be left off for &s;ome time; till the&s;e are either cured, or at lea&s;t mitigated.</P>
<P>We &s;hould endeavour to palliate di&s;|orders in tho&s;e per&s;ons, who do not bear <HI>hemlock;</HI> &s;o long as we are unacquainted with any other remedy.</P>
<P>The bones, tumors, <HI>&s;cirrhu&s;es,</HI> are often attended with great pain in their inner|mo&s;t rece&s;&s;es: I have often ob&s;erved in &s;uch ca&s;es, there was an ero&s;ion, or corrup|tion, in that place: but a corrupted part &s;hould be &s;eparated from the &s;ound, which cannot be done without an external aper|ture, made by a cau&s;tic application, or chirurgical in&s;trument; but by the u&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="47">of <HI>hemlock</HI> it is often made &s;pontane|ou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Then corrupted matter i&s;&s;ues forth, and there is a &s;inuous ulcer.</P>
<P>The le&s;s intelligent imagine, that this corruption proceeds from the u&s;e of <HI>hem|lock:</HI> although upon the continued u&s;e of it in the &s;ame ca&s;e, whether internal or external, perfect health often en&s;ues.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes &s;een certain <HI>&s;cirrhu&s;es</HI> in the glands di&s;&s;olved by the u&s;e of <HI>hem|lock,</HI> but new ones appeared in other parts.</P>
<P>That &s;eemed &s;trange: but the &s;ick al|ways found them&s;elves well in other re|&s;pects; &s;o that I continued the &s;ame re|medy, and cured the patients.</P>
<P>Such things never frighten the &s;kilful: and therefore we ought not immediately to change the medicine.</P>
<P>In diet, farinaceous unfermented &s;ub|&s;tances are to be avoided; and likewi&s;e too acrid &s;pices.</P>
<P>Acids are allowed for a condiment; but when they are too predominant, they are not &s;o proper.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="48">
<P>Good wine does not hurt tho&s;e, who are u&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>Friction, or great motion, in the part affected, generally increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is very conducive to a cure, for the &s;ick to live in a free and open air, and to pre&s;erve a chearful and right di&s;po&s;ition of mind.</P>
<P>Sadne&s;s, melancholy, di&s;turbances of the mind, retard and hinder the cure; occa&s;ion new di&s;orders; and often turn a <HI>&s;cirrhus</HI> to a <HI>cancer.</HI></P>
<P>The time in which <HI>hemlock</HI> may cure, and re&s;olve tumors, cannot be determin|ed.</P>
<P>For &s;ometimes that is &s;oon done, &s;ome|times very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>Nor is the nature of ulcers, tumors, or cancers, always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I gave a woman <HI>hemlock</HI> in a large do&s;e for tumors of the neck, more than two years, without any alteration in the tu|mors: but as her men&s;es flowed more plentifully, her &s;trength was greater, mind more chearful, and the whole habit of
<PB N="46" REF="49">body much better, &s;he de&s;ired her&s;elf, that I would not deny her tho&s;e pills.</P>
<P>At length, after two years and a half, the tumors were di&s;&s;olved, and everything reduced to a natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>Nor did the long u&s;e of it do any harm.</P>
<P>I have another woman, who took only two grains of <HI>hemlock</HI> in the morning, for a cancer of the brea&s;t; and although &s;he was a woman of &s;eventy, there en&s;ued &s;o good and &s;udden a change, and dimi|nution of the tumor, that both the by|&s;tanders and my&s;elf were a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>This woman made urine mo&s;t plenti|fully, with much glutinous &s;ediment. But when &s;he ab&s;tained one day from <HI>hemlock,</HI> the urine was in a &s;mall quantity, and without the &s;ediment.</P>
<P>In di&s;ea&s;es about the kidnies, bladder, and urinary pa&s;&s;ages, <HI>hemlock</HI> &s;ometimes has mo&s;t excellent effects.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes cures a retention of urine, and &s;trangury; and often ea&s;es pains in making urine, &s;ooner than <HI>opium.</HI></P>
<PB N="47" REF="50">
<P>Nor is the extract of <HI>hemlock</HI> to be de|&s;pi&s;ed, in di&s;orders ari&s;ing from a &s;tone.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid, it appears, that <HI>hemlock</HI> is highly worthy of being tried.</P>
<P>In the mean time I do not affirm, it has any &s;pecific virtue; but I expect the mutual aid of good phy&s;icians, to e&s;tabli&s;h rules about it.</P>
