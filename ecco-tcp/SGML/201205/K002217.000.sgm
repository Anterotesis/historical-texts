<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE CONSUMPTIVE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IF it &s;hould be a&s;ked, why I addre&s;s my|&s;elf to the Patient, rather than to the Phy&s;ician, I an&s;wer, that, having offended the Doctor in my title-page, I pre&s;ume he will give but little attention to my rea&s;on|ing; for we li&s;ten very unfavourably to the advice of a man who begins by a&s;&s;erting, that we are <HI>fundamentally wrong.</HI> But with the Patient, the ca&s;e is different: recollect|ing that con&s;umptions, in the pre&s;ent mode of practice, are very rarely cured, he al|mo&s;t a&s;&s;ents to the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion, even before he has heard the arguments upon which it is founded. I &s;peak, there|fore, not immediately to the Phy&s;ician, be|cau&s;e I do not like that a man &s;hould turn his back on me when I am talking to him. If the Doctor chu&s;es, whil&s;t I am conver|&s;ing with my Patient, to look another way, yet <HI>&s;quint</HI> an ear to my babbling, he is very welcome; provided he will not condemn my
<PB N="4" REF="5">practice, till he hath proved its futility by experience.</P>
<P>Now, though I write not directly to Me|dical Gentlemen, I e&s;teem it neverthele&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to proceed methodically, and ac|cordingly &s;hall premi&s;e as much of the ana|tomical and phy&s;iological de&s;cription of the lungs, as will be &s;ufficient to enable tho&s;e, who have not had a medical education, to comprehend my arguments. I &s;hall then enquire into the predi&s;po&s;ing and imme|diate cau&s;es of Con&s;umptions; &s;hall indicate the &s;ymptoms by which the patient may be certain of his di&s;order; and &s;hall la&s;tly proceed to con&s;ider the cure, upon rational principles.</P>
<P>The trunk of the human body is divided, by a remembrane called the Diaphragm, into two di&s;tinct cavities, the lower of which is called the <HI>abdomen,</HI> or belly, and the up|per, the <HI>thorax,</HI> or che&s;t. The latter of the&s;e cavities contains the heart and the lungs. The lungs are divided into two principal lobes, which are inclo&s;ed in two di&s;tinct bags, formed by a membrane called the <HI>pleura;</HI> &s;o that the right and left lobe of the lungs have not the lea&s;t communi|cation. The adhe&s;ion of the&s;e bags near the middle of the che&s;t, forms of perpen|dicular membrane called the <HI>media&s;tinum;</HI> but receding from each other as they go lower down, they form a third bag, called
<PB N="5" REF="6">the <HI>pericardium,</HI> which contains the heart: &s;o that the che&s;t is divided into three &s;epa|rate cavities.</P>
<P>The lungs are compo&s;ed of blood ve&s;&s;els, air ve&s;&s;els, lymphatic or water ve&s;&s;els, nerves and callular membrane.</P>
<P>The blood ve&s;&s;els are arteries and veins; but the&s;e are of two di&s;tinct kinds: the fir&s;t receive and return the whole ma&s;s of blood, which circulates through the lungs, before it is thrown into the other parts of the body; and the &s;econd were intended only for the &s;upport and nouri&s;hment of the lungs them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The air ve&s;&s;els are infinitely &s;mall branches continued from the wind-pipe, with which, in a &s;ound &s;tate, they have a free commu|nication, &s;o as at every in&s;piration to be filled with air.</P>
<P>The lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are di&s;tributed on the &s;urface of the lungs, and convey the lymph, which they imbibe, to a certain duct, whence it is returned to the ma&s;s of blood.</P>
<P>The nerves are exceeding &s;mall branches, which proceed chiefly from what is called the eighth pair.</P>
<P>The cellular membrance, which fills the intermediate parts between the ve&s;&s;els, is compo&s;ed of fibres or <HI>laminae,</HI> which are neitheer va&s;cular, nor endowed with &s;en&s;i|bility.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<P>The <HI>a&s;pera arteria,</HI> or wind-pipe, is that tube which conveys the air, pa&s;&s;ing through the mough or no&s;e, to and from the lungs. It is compo&s;ed of alternate cartilaginous and fle&s;hy rings, behind which are an infi|nite number of &s;mall glands, which &s;up|ply the wind-pipe with a thin pellucid mu|cus lining its internal &s;urface, which con|&s;i&s;ts of a membrance of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Thus much being premi&s;ed, we &s;hall now proceed to the office and utility of the lungs, which are nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood, be|fore we &s;peak of its di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The organs of re&s;piration are &s;o indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to our exi&s;tence, it is no wonder that phy&s;iologi&s;ts &s;hould have taken uncommon pains to di&s;cover the real de&s;ign of Nature in their formation. Various have been the conjectures of authors on this &s;ub|ject. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed, that the blood in pa&s;&s;ing through the lungs acquired its red colour; others have been of opinion, that the intention of re&s;piration is to receive a certain quantity of air, which they ima|gined nece&s;&s;ary to be mixed with the vital fluid; with many other &s;uppo&s;itions equal|ly without foundation. That Nature, by fir&s;t circulating the blood through the lungs, after the reception of fre&s;h chyle, intended &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary preparation, may be con|cluded without farther examination; and that this preparation is effected by throw|ing
<PB N="7" REF="8">off a certain quantity of noxious mat|ter, imbibed by the air with is received by the lungs, &s;eems evident from the ex|periments which prove that air, once &s;atu|rated with this noxious matter, is unfit for re&s;piration. The notion that animals, when confined to breathe the &s;ame air, die be|cau&s;e the ela&s;ticity of the air is de&s;troyed, is entirely without foundation; it being very ea&s;y to prove, that the ela&s;ticity of the air is not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed. The u&s;e therefore of re&s;piration, is to relieve the body from a certain matter, per&s;pirable only from the lungs, which, if entirely retained, is incompatible with exi&s;tence, and, when retained in part, is productive of di&s;ea&s;e. It is &s;eparated from the blood by means of &s;mall ducts pa&s;&s;ing from the pulmonary arteries to the air ve&s;&s;els, where it is di&s;&s;olved and carried off by the air. The exi&s;tence of the&s;e ducts is ea&s;ily de|mon&s;trated, by injecting almo&s;t any liquor into the pulmonary artery, which liquor may, without much difficulty, be made thus to fill the branches of the wind-pipe.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that we are now pretty well acquainted with the fabric and office of the lungs, we may, I think, with &s;afety pro|ceed to the more immediate object of our attempt.</P>
<P>The general predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of a con|&s;umption of the lungs are to be &s;ought for
<PB N="8" REF="9">in the original formation of the body, the acrimony of the juices, or the age of the patient. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e cau&s;es, without rea&s;oning about the matter, it is &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that people of a &s;lender and delicate frame, who&s;e &s;kin appears remarkably tran&s;parent, who&s;e che&s;t is flat and narrow, and &s;houl|ders high, are in general more &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e than people of a contrary make; becau&s;e, &s;ay the learned, the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs are, in &s;uch bodies, too fine, and too weak, to re&s;i&s;t the impetus of the blood, flowing with great rapidity through the or|gan of re&s;piration: a rupture of the ve&s;&s;els, a &s;pitting of blood, &amp;c. are the con&s;equence. The &s;ame effects may be produced by an extraordinary acrimony in the fluids, which may corrode the ve&s;&s;els; and as to the third cau&s;e, it is attributed to the fervor of the blood, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be greate&s;t at the age when people are mo&s;t liable to con|&s;umptions. To a &s;agacious reader, part of this rea&s;oning will appear plau&s;ible, and part otherwi&s;e. But the&s;e are remote cau&s;es, which are equally applicable to all coun|tries, and which do not in the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t us in accounting for the peculiar con&s;ump|tive propen&s;ity in the inhabitants of this i&s;land.</P>
<P>This propen&s;ity mu&s;t be accounted for, not by any predi&s;po&s;ition in the make of
<PB N="9" REF="10">our bodies, but by what is called a Pro|catarctic or occa&s;ional cau&s;e, namely, the in&s;tability of our climate, or rather its im|mediate effect, a Cold, to which, I am con|vinced, the frequency of Con&s;umptions in this kingdom is chiefly to be attributed.</P>
<P>What is a cold, and what are its effects?</P>
<P>The que&s;tions are of importance; let us not, therefore, be too precipitate. Expe|rience, our be&s;t in&s;tructor, hath taught us, that nothing is &s;o detrimental to the human body, as &s;udden tran&s;itions from one ex|treme to another; but it is particularly true in regard to heat and cold. The natural effects of warm air is to relax the &s;kin, con|&s;equently to open our pores, and con&s;e|quently to increa&s;e our per&s;piration; an effect which may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to take place equally in the lungs, as on the &s;urface of the body. When the body, in this &s;tate, is &s;uddenly expo&s;ed to a cold air, the con&s;equence is an immediate &s;pa&s;m over its whole &s;urface. The pores are ob&s;tinately clo&s;ed, and the per&s;pirable matter is gra|dually returned into the ma&s;s of blood.</P>
<P>That this per&s;pirable matter is of an ex|ceeding acrid nature, is evident from its effects. By irritating the ve&s;&s;els, it in|crea&s;es their o&s;cillations, which, increa&s;ing the circulation, produces fever. Its acri|mony appears even in the very fir&s;t &s;ymp|tom of a Cold. The pores of the head have
<PB N="10" REF="11">&s;carcely been clo&s;ed a moment, before the per&s;pirable matter, falling upon the mem|brane which lines the no&s;e, cau&s;es, by its irritation, that convul&s;ive motion which we call Sneezing. It returns upon the glands about the wind-pipe, and i&s;&s;uing thence excites another convul&s;ive motion, called a Cough; which are different efforts of Na|ture to rid her&s;elf of the offending cau&s;e. In oozing down the wind-pipe, it de&s;troys the mucus, therefore we are hoar&s;e; and by inflaming the membrane which lines the <HI>trachia,</HI> occa&s;ions that &s;en&s;ation of &s;orene&s;s in the brea&s;t, which we feel in a few hours after taking cold. Thus continually de|&s;cending, it enters the branches of air ve&s;|&s;els, and diffu&s;ing it&s;elf to every part of the lungs, occa&s;ions the cough, which we &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h from that which proceeds from an irritation in the upper part of the wind-pipe, and which we call a Tickling cough.</P>
<P>We are not however to imagine, that this acrid lymph, which falls from above, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of irritation in the lungs. On the contrary, it is more probable, that they are principally offended by the acri|mony of that which i&s;&s;ues from their own peculiar glands; for in &s;evere colds, that is, when the ob&s;truction of per&s;piration is almo&s;t univer&s;al, (for it is never entirely &s;o) in &s;uch ca&s;es, I &s;ay, every humour in the
<PB N="11" REF="12">body is contaminated; and that very mucus, which in health prevents irritation in the air ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, is now the princi|pal cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Inflammation is the natural con&s;equence of this continued irritation, which as na|turally produces a &s;uperabundant &s;ecretion of mucus, and which, if not con&s;tantly &s;pit up, &s;uffocates the patient. When the&s;e &s;ymptoms are violent, the di&s;ea&s;e is called a Peripneumony: but if this inflamma|tion continues beyond a certain time, the ve&s;&s;els are de&s;troyed, and become di&s;&s;olved in a kind of matter called <HI>pus.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we are arrived at the immediate, or proximate, cau&s;e of a Con&s;umption of the &s;ub&s;tance, of the lungs. But here it may naturally be a&s;ked, how it happens, when a part of an organ, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to life, is de&s;troyed, that the pa|tient does not immediately die? I an&s;wer, that Nature, in this in&s;tance, has been par|ticularly kind to us; for the two lobes of the lungs, having no communication, are not immediately affected by each other's di&s;|ea&s;es; be&s;ides, every minute branch of the &s;ame lobe is &s;o contrived, as to perform its office independent of the re&s;t; therefore every &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el continues to receive and return its portion of air, till it be actually de&s;troyed. Hence it is, that in di&s;&s;ecting of bodies which have died con&s;umptive, we
<PB N="12" REF="13">frequently find a con&s;iderable part of the lungs entirely de&s;troyed. Indeed the ap|pearance of the lungs, in tho&s;e who have died of this di&s;ea&s;e, is &s;o various, that, though it may be but of one genus, the number of &s;pecies are extremely numerous, if we may conclude from the diver&s;ity of phoenomena upon di&s;&s;ection. Sometimes we find a texture of a part of the lungs en|tirely de&s;troyed, and nothing but a collec|tion of purulent matter in its place, com|municating with the wind-pipe, &s;o as to fill it on laying the head downward. At other times we di&s;cover a quantity of matter inclo&s;ed in a kind of bag. Sometimes this matter is contained in a number of &s;mall follicles, and at others, it may be &s;queezed from every part, and the texture of the lungs but little injured. In &s;ome ca&s;es, we find a number of &s;mall hard lumps; in others, large indurations, and &s;ometimes tumours that are ab&s;olutely cancerous. In &s;hort, as I have before ob&s;erved, the variety of ap|pearances is infinite, e&s;pecially if we in|clude colour.</P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding this great di|ver&s;ity, the proximate cau&s;e of that &s;pecies of Con&s;umption which is &s;o frequent, and &s;o fatal, in this kingdom, is an ulcer in the lungs, in con&s;equence of inflammation, oc|ca&s;ioned by a cold, or, in other words, by a greater flux of acrid per&s;pirable matter to
<PB N="13" REF="14">the lungs, than can be ab&s;orbed and car|ried off by the air. It is al&s;o po&s;&s;ible, that a part of this matter may be confined near the extremities of the air ve&s;&s;els, by a &s;pa&s;|modic con&s;triction in the upper part, occa|sioned by the &s;udden admi&s;&s;ion of cold air. When this is the ca&s;e, an inclo&s;ed ulcer, or <HI>vomica,</HI> is the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Having proceeded thus far in the con&s;i|deration of our &s;ubject, and, I think, with|out &s;training our text, we are now naturally led from the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> to the <HI>cure</HI> of our di&s;|ea&s;e. And fir&s;t it may not be ami&s;s to en|quire a little into the foundation of the ge|neral practice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thought, which naturally oc|curs, is, that this general practice is gene|rally un&s;ucce&s;sful; and we thence as natu|rally conclude, that it mu&s;t be fundamen|tally wrong.</P>
<P>If the inflammation be violent, compa|ring it with inflammations in other parts of the body, and rea&s;oning from analogy, the fir&s;t thing we do is to bleed; and &s;o far we are right, as, by le&s;&s;ening the quantity of blood, we le&s;&s;en the impetus of the remain|ing part, and thereby retard the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e for a time: but alas! the time is very &s;hort: the pul&s;e &s;oon recovers its velocity and &s;trength. Well; but then we admini&s;ter a quantity of &s;accharine, oily and mucilaginous medicines, in the form
<PB N="14" REF="15">of an emul&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, intending, no doubt, thereby to &s;heathe and obtund the acrimony which cau&s;es the irritation in the lungs. The intention is certainly lau|dable; but it happens unfortunately that the&s;e balfamics go down, not into the lungs, but into the &s;tomach, where they imme|diately undergo &s;uch a change, as to carry but little of their bal&s;amic qualities even into the inte&s;tines, where they are &s;till far|ther mixed and adulterated, particularly by the addition of a certain quantity of bile, immediately on quitting the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>But to proceed. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e demulcents already in the inte&s;tines. What becomes of them? They mu&s;t either be received by the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, or pa&s;s off <HI>per anum;</HI> the latter of which is the way cho&s;en by the greate&s;t part of them, con|trary to the intention of the phy&s;ician. Happily for mankind, the&s;e lacteal ve&s;&s;els are endowed with a kind of mechanical &s;agacity, which enables them to &s;elect from that heterogeneous ma&s;s of food and medi|cines, con&s;tantly pre&s;ented to them by the &s;tomach, &s;uch matter only, under the de|nomination of chyle, as is fit to be a&s;&s;imi|lated with the blood.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall be interrupted with an ob|jection, that the lacteals are capable of ad|mitting poi&s;onous matter, and conveying it to the heart, to the immediate de&s;truction
<PB N="15" REF="16">of the body. To this objection, (having fir&s;t hinted, that mo&s;t poi&s;ons are de&s;truc|tive from their immediate action on the nerves in the &s;tomach) I an&s;wer, that Na|ture acts, not by partial, but by general laws. Tho&s;e who are incapable of apply|ing this argument, de&s;erve no other reply.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e, that a &s;mall portion of our bal&s;amics has gained admittance through the mouths of the lacteals. Thence it is conveyed into the glands of the me|&s;entery, and having been &s;ecerned through &s;everal of the&s;e, it ri&s;es into a certain re|ceptacle whence it is conducted into a vein under the left arm, and thus mixes with the blood. It now &s;oon reaches the heart, and from thence thus mingled with blood, it pa&s;&s;es through the lungs. I &s;ay <HI>through</HI> the lungs; becau&s;e it is immediately return|ed to the heart, thence to be di&s;tributed through the re&s;t of the body.</P>
<P>Now it mu&s;t be remembered, that the &s;eat of the di&s;order which, by the&s;e heal|ing medicines, we are endeavouring to cure, is not in the blood ve&s;&s;els, but in the air ve&s;&s;els of the lungs; and that the&s;e air ve&s;|&s;els have no communication with the arte|ries, except by means of tubes or pores &s;o extremely &s;mall, as not to admit the red globules of the blood; con&s;equently the con&s;tituent particles of our medicine mu&s;t be &s;maller than the&s;e, otherwi&s;e no part of
<PB N="16" REF="17">it can po&s;&s;ibly be thus applied to the part injured. But we have &s;aid, that a liquor may, by injection through the pulmo|nary artery, be forced into the <HI>bronchia:</HI> true; but this liquor pa&s;&s;es colourle&s;s, al|ways depo&s;iting in its pa&s;&s;age the matter with which it was tinged.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being properly con&s;idered, let me now a&s;k the reader, whether he thinks it probable, that even the lead be|nefit can rationally be expected from &s;ac|charine, oily, mucilaginous, or bal&s;amic medicines thus applied?</P>
<P>What then is to be done? Has Nature been &s;o unkind, particularly to the inhabi|tants of this i&s;land, as to afflict us with a di&s;ea&s;e for which there is no remedy? I verily believe &s;he has not been &s;o unkind. The fault is not in Nature, but in our&s;elves; or, perhaps, rather in the difficulty of the ta&s;k: for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, in the pre&s;ent improved &s;late of chemi&s;try and anatomy, that all thinking men are not perfectly &s;en|&s;ible of the improbability, I had almo&s;t &s;aid impo&s;&s;ibility, of applying demulcents to the lungs through the alimentary canal: nor is it more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e them forget|ful, that the only po&s;&s;ible way of applying medicines directly to the lungs, is through the wind-pipe. But, as I have before ob|&s;erved, they have been prevented from at|tempting
<PB N="17" REF="18">this obvious method, by the dif|ficulties which occurred in the execution.</P>
<P>To convey any palpable &s;olid or liquid &s;ub&s;tance through the wind-pipe into the lungs, we know to be impo&s;&s;ible; for that, if the lea&s;t crumb of bread, or drop of any liquor, happens by accident to enter the <HI>glottis,</HI> a violent cough is immediately ex|cited, till the offending matter be rejected. But we al&s;o know, that impalpable volatile matter is ince&s;&s;antly carried to and from the lungs, along with the air; every &s;ub&s;tance therefore that can be volatilized, may be conveyed directly to the lungs. Aqueous liquors may be ea&s;ily converted into vapour, and vapour may be impregnated with great variety of medicinal &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>On the&s;e con&s;iderations, it &s;hould now &s;eem, that the whole my&s;tery is at once di&s;covered, and that we have nothing more to do, than to convert our proper medicines into vapour, and &s;o convey them directly to the di&s;ea&s;ed part. Alas! there are many considerable ob&s;tacles yet to &s;urmount, as will appear from a chemical view of the medicines in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that our patient, having caught a &s;evere cold, labours under an in|flammation of that membrane or &s;kin which is continued from the mouth, down the wind-pipe, into the <HI>bronchia;</HI> and that this
<PB N="18" REF="19">inflammation is chiefly in the lungs. Or let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the irritating matter is not &s;ufficiently acrid to produce much in|flammation, but only a &s;uperabundant &s;e|cretion of acrid mucus. Or, let us farther &s;uppo&s;e, that the lungs are actually ulce|rated. In the&s;e &s;everal &s;tages, or degrees of the di&s;order, what are the indications?</P>
<P>Our endeavours to re&s;tore the ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, are undoubtedly rational; but our medicines, given with this intention, commonly fail. They excite indeed a co|pious &s;weat; but the fluid thus determined to the &s;urface of the body, is totally dif|ferent from that volatile matter which, in a &s;ound &s;tate, exhales particularly from the lungs, and to the diminution of which ex|halation, the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is &s;olely to be attributed. But what is the pre&s;ent danger? It is, that the inflammation may end in &s;uppuration; or that the acrid mat|ter may be ob&s;tructed by mucus, or &s;pa&s;m, and &s;o corrode, indurate, or de&s;troy the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs. The immediate indication therefore is, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre|vent the&s;e con&s;equences; which I pre&s;ume can only be effected by the application of anti&s;eptic, (that is, medicines which re&s;i&s;t putrefaction) anti&s;pa&s;modic, attenuating, and bal&s;amic medicines, directly to the part affected.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> anti&s;eptics, there is no difficulty, the mo&s;t powerful of them (I &s;peak from experience) being in their nature volatile. Anti&s;pa&s;modics and attenuants are equally ea&s;y of conveyance; &s;o that the &s;ole difficulty lies in our bal&s;a|mic medicines, which are very refractory, but of great importance.</P>
<P>Gums, mucilages, and expre&s;t oils, are by no means volatile: nor would I, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, give one farthing to find them otherwi&s;e; as they would, at any rate, be totally unfit for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Our whole attention therefore is fixed on the re&s;inous native bal&s;ams, but not indi&s;cri|minately. Tho&s;e who have be&s;towed &s;o much attention on them as my&s;elf will find them extremely different in their che|mical properties and effects on the human body. Be&s;ides, they are rarely to be met with genuine; and a thorough knowledge of them is only to be acquired by long ex|perience and frequent examination.</P>
<P>The chief of the liquid bal&s;ams are, Bal|&s;am of Gilead, of Copaiba, of Peru, of To|lu, of Canada; and the dry bal&s;ams are Benjoine, Storax, Labdanum, Myrrh and Ma&s;tich, and the Terpentines. But though the&s;e &s;everal &s;ub&s;tances are much alike in their chemical properties, yet they differ e&s;|&s;entially in their medical virtues; which is ea&s;ily accounted for, from the difference in
<PB N="20" REF="21">quantity and quality of the etherial oil which they contain.</P>
<P>The chemical properties, as far as they are commonly known, of the&s;e fragrant re&s;ins or bal&s;ams, are, that they are inflam|mable, di&s;&s;oluble in rectified &s;pirits, but not in water. Now, this being the ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing, even after a thou&s;and experi|ments, that we have fixed upon tho&s;e who&s;e oils are lea&s;t acrid, and which, in every re&s;pect, are be&s;t fitted for our purpo&s;e, how &s;hall we po&s;&s;ibly contrive to convey them to the lungs in a proper vehicle? They will not di&s;&s;olve in water, and the vapour of &s;pirit of wine is much too ardent and in|flammatory.</P>
<P>If indeed we had remained &s;atisfied with the&s;e general properties, without farther enquiry, we &s;hould &s;till have believed, with our neighbours, that the attempt was im|practicable; that it was impo&s;&s;ible to apply an efficacious remedy directly to the lungs, and con&s;equently that con&s;umptions were incurable.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I was capable of enquiry, it hath been a con&s;tant maxim with me to take nothing for granted upon any autho|rity what&s;oever. Upon this principle, I be|gan my experimental di&s;qui&s;itions relative to the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, being fully per|&s;uaded, for rea&s;ons which will hereafter appear, that if I could find means to con|vey
<PB N="21" REF="22">the be&s;t of the&s;e native fragrant bal|&s;ams to the lungs in a mild and truly bal|&s;amic &s;tate, the con&s;umptive people of this i&s;land might expect con&s;iderable benefit from my &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Were I to relate the many fruitle&s;s ex|periments I have made &s;ince I fir&s;t en|gaged in this enquiry, the reader would be &s;urprized at my patience and per&s;eve|rance; but it would an&s;wer no other pur|po&s;e. Let it &s;uffice therefore to tell him, that I, at la&s;t, hit upon a certain chemi|cal liquor, which, to my great a&s;toni&s;h|ment, di&s;&s;olved at lea&s;t double the quan|tity of the bal&s;amic re&s;ins which I had &s;e|lected, to any men&s;truum which I had ever tried or heard of. The plea&s;ure I felt upon this di&s;covery can only be conceived by tho&s;e who have had the happine&s;s to extend, in any degree, the path of know|ledge. It immediately occurred to me, that the di&s;covery of &s;o powerful a men|&s;truum would not only be a con&s;iderable &s;tep in my pre&s;ent pur&s;uit, but might pro|bably prove of &s;ingular advantage to me|dicine in general. But what added greatly to my expectations was, that this liquor happens to be of exceeding volatility, not at all inflammatory, and remarkably anti|&s;eptic and anti&s;pa&s;modic.</P>
<P>Thus far I had obtained every thing that I could wi&s;h. My &s;olution, however, was too &s;trong for the purpo&s;e I intended.
<PB N="22" REF="23">I therefore, by way of experiment, drop|ped a few drops of it into boiling water, and found, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that the &s;team was richly impregnated, both with the anti&s;pa&s;modic and anti&s;eptic qua|lities of the men&s;truum, and al&s;o with the bal&s;amic and &s;alubrious principles of the fragrant re&s;ins. This vapour I drew in with my breath, for a con&s;iderable time, and found it not in the lea&s;t irritating; but, on the contrary, extremely mild and agreeable. Being now de&s;irous to a&s;certain the quanti|ty of the di&s;&s;olved re&s;ins, which thus ro&s;e with the vapour, I poured half an ounce of my &s;olution into a quantity of hot water, and after evaporating the whole I found remaining in the ve&s;&s;el a very &s;mall propor|tion of t e weight of bal&s;am which had been di&s;&s;olved in that quantity, and con&s;e|quently by much the greate&s;t part had ri&s;en with the vapour.</P>
<P>Let me now a&s;k the reader, whether he is not of opinion, that the happie&s;t effects may rationally be expected from &s;uch a medicine thus applied, by means of the &s;team of hot water, directly to the injured lungs? Whether he does not think it pro|bable, that the acrimony of the irritating fluid will be thus obtunded, either in a recent cold, or more advanced &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e? Whether the &s;pa&s;modic con&s;tric|tion of the ve&s;&s;els will not thus be relaxed,
<PB N="23" REF="24">and the con&s;equence of ob&s;tructions pre|vented? Whether the progre&s;s of putre|faction may not thus be &s;topped; and whe|ther, in that ca&s;e, even in the advanced &s;tage of a con&s;umption, we may not hope for a cure?</P>
<P>When a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ub&s;tance of both lobes of the lungs is de&s;troyed, the di&s;ea&s;e is doubtle&s;s incurable; but we know from di&s;&s;ection, that commonly one lobe only is principally affected. If there|fore we can thus &s;top the progre&s;s of pu|trefaction in the di&s;ea&s;ed lobe, the other may continue to perform its office, and the patient &s;uffer but little inconveniency.</P>
<P>There remains yet another argument in favour of this new method of applica|tion, which, I think, will appear to be a powerful one. We know that many peo|ple, who have been far gone in a con&s;ump|tion, have recovered by removing to hap|pier climates. We cannot rationally attri|bute their recovery to any other cau&s;e than a difference in the air they breathe, which difference mu&s;t ari&s;e from its being impregnated with certain &s;alubrious, anti|&s;eptic, or bal&s;amic <HI>effluvia.</HI> Since there|fore this natural application of &s;alutiferous air to the part affected will produce that which medicines taken into the &s;tomach had attempted in vain, are we not thereby naturally led to conclude, that the be&s;t way
<PB N="24" REF="25">of admini&s;tering to the lungs is by means of the air? It were ridiculous to attribute the recovery of con&s;umptive people, on their migration to a milder climate, mere|ly to increa&s;e of heat, which might be in|crea&s;ed to any degree in the patient's cham|ber at home. On the contrary, we know that heat remarkably accelerates putrefac|tion; &s;o that in a putrid &s;tate of the lungs, if it were not for &s;ome powerful counter|acting cau&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e, by travelling &s;outhward, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>With regard to the manner of applying this medicine, it is extremely ea&s;y. I u&s;u|ally drop 30 or 40 drops into about half a pint of boiling water immediately after it is taken from the fire, ordering the patient to hold his mouth over the ve&s;&s;el, &s;o as to draw in with his breath as much as po&s;&s;ible of the vapour, continuing the operation as long as the &s;team will ri&s;e. I then or|der him to drink the water as &s;oon as it is cold enough for that purpo&s;e: for, though I depend entirely on the vapour for the cure of the lungs, yet, as all the juices in the body may be in &s;ome degree affected by the matter ab&s;orbed from the lungs, this bal&s;amic water, received into the &s;tomach, will be of &s;ome advantage.</P>
<P>This &s;imple method of application will be adundantly &s;ufficient in common colds, hoar&s;ene&s;s, &amp;c. but when there is rea&s;on
<PB N="25" REF="26">to &s;u&s;pect, that the lungs are dangerou&s;ly affected, and that the di&s;ea&s;e is actually verging towards a con&s;umption, a more copi|ous application is nece&s;&s;ary. For this pur|po&s;e I have contrived a &s;imple machine, by means of which a much greater quantity of the bal&s;amic <HI>effluvium</HI> is received into the lungs. The figure of this ve&s;&s;el may be &s;een in the plate facing the title-page. It holds about a pint. Half a pint of boiling water mu&s;t be poured in, and the medicine immediately dropped into the water. The head being then fixed upon it, the patient applies his mouth to the pipe, and thus draws in the &s;team with his breath, removing the pipe from his lips at every expiration. The ve&s;&s;el is made of pewter. Tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with the nature of evaporation will not be at a lo&s;s to account for the conic form of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The reader now naturally expects, that I &s;hould tell him the ingredients and man|ner of preparing the medicine; otherwi&s;e, he is determined to pronounce me a quack, and, notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;aid, to believe that my book is intended merely to promote the &s;ale of a medicine for my own emolument. I mu&s;t intreat him, however, to hear the rea&s;ons which have determined me to keep this preparation a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Give me leave to &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that this medicine, thus applied, may be
<PB N="26" REF="27">of infinite &s;ervice to a con&s;iderable number of people in this kingdom. If I were to make it public, &s;o as that it might be prepared by every apothecary in the nation, what would be the con&s;equence? The con|&s;equence would be, that, notwith&s;tanding its excellence, it would be neglected, and a number of people thereby deprived of a benefit which, &s;o long as it remains a &s;e|cret, they may rea&s;onably expect; nothing being more certain, than that mankind na|turally de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e things which are com|monly known, and too ea&s;ily obtained. Of this truth I could produce a thou&s;and ex|amples. Some of the be&s;t medicines that ever were contrived have &s;unk into obli|vion, for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e their compo&s;ition was made known. Does any one believe that Dr. Jame's powder would have been &s;o univer&s;ally beneficial, if he had publi&s;hed his &s;ecret to the world?</P>
<P>If this an&s;wer be thought in&s;ufficient, I confe&s;s that I have no better to give. With regard to the medicine in que&s;tion, I think I have &s;aid enough to convince the patient, that his hopes of relief from its effects are rationally founded; and that, though it will not perform miracles, he may neverthele&s;s expect from its bal&s;amic quality, that it will de&s;troy the acrimony of the irritating fluid; from its attenuating and anti&s;pa&s;modic principles, that it will remove ob&s;tructions;
<PB N="27" REF="28">and from its anti&s;eptic power, that it will prevent putrefaction, or &s;top its progre&s;s when begun, and thus pre&s;erve the &s;ound part of the lungs, and give an opportunity to nature to regenerate the parts that were already de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>What! &s;ays the &s;agacious reader, do you imagine, if a part of the lungs be ac|tually de&s;troyed, that it can ever be re|&s;tored? &mdash;Sir, it is a maxim with me, ne|ver to affirm any thing which I cannot prove; but I know no rea&s;on why nature &s;hould not as ea&s;ily re&s;tore a part of the lungs as a part of an external mu&s;cle, or a part of the external &s;kin, which is con|tinued into the lungs, and which is as va&s;cular as the lungs them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now beg leave to add a few words concerning the diet, &amp;c. of con&s;umptive people; for, though our opinion of a me|dicine be ever &s;o great, it were certainly imprudent to neglect &s;uch other means as may contribute to its &s;ucce&s;s; and indeed, if the di&s;ea&s;e be far advanced, little is to be expected from any medicine what&s;oever, unle&s;s the patient will adhere implicitly to the rules pre&s;cribed by his phy&s;ician, rela|tive to his diet and manner of living.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with regard to exerci&s;e. Our im|mortal Sydenham was &s;o &s;trongly prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of riding on hor&s;e-back, that he con&s;tantly recommended that exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="28" REF="29">in every &s;tage of a con&s;umption. It is, however, with this, as with mo&s;t effi|cacious medicines; if it does no good, it certainly does harm. The patient him&s;elf will be able to determine whether its ef|fects be &s;alutary or otherwi&s;e, by ob&s;erving the following directions. Fir&s;t, unle&s;s the weather be hot, let his clothing be &s;ome|what warmer than u&s;ual, as he will other|wi&s;e grow chilly. Let him ride not more than an hour at a time, and that every gent|ly. If it be in &s;pring or autumn, he mu&s;t ride from eleven to twelve, or from twelve to one. If in the hotter months, let it be from nine to ten in the morning. But in moi&s;t or cold weather let him not ride at all. If, after this gentle exerci&s;e, he find him&s;elf in better &s;pirits, his appetite in|crea&s;ed, his breathing ea&s;y, and his &s;kin cool and &s;oft, he may certainly conclude that riding is of &s;ervice to him, and ought therefore to be continued as often as the weather will permit. If, on the contrary, he find him&s;elf fatigued, his breathing more frequent and more difficult, his &s;kin parched and dry, the palms of his hands hot, his cheeks flu&s;hed, his tongue dry, and in him&s;elf an inclination to drink rather than eat, he may then conclude that ri|ding is improper in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his di&s;order, and that taking the air in a car|riage will have better effects. If never|thele&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="30">he find no alteration for the bet|ter, I advi&s;e him, by all means, to have recour&s;e to a &s;ea voyage, from which, with the continuance of the medicine here re|commended, I venture to promi&s;e him every thing that human art can po&s;&s;ibly &s;up|ply. It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that though I have above, in &s;peaking of riding, limited the patient to an hour at a time, I mean that, in proportion to his in|crea&s;e of &s;trength, and benefit received, the time &s;hould be prolonged, and the de|gree of exerci&s;e augmented.</P>
<P>We come now to aliment, which is of infinite importance. The fir&s;t general rule which I give to my con&s;umptive patients is, that, regardle&s;s of all &s;tated hours, he is to eat as often as he has an appetite, but never much at a time. If, when he ri&s;es in a morning, he find no appetite for his breakfa&s;t, let him walk a little into the air, and wait an hour or two before he takes any food. As to tea, I ab&s;olutely forbid it, becau&s;e it is an enemy to weak nerves, but more e&s;pecially on account of the warm water, which greatly relaxes the &s;tomach. A &s;ea bi&s;cuit with a pint of cold almond milk, made with barley water or whey, is a good breakfa&s;t for a con&s;umptive per&s;on; or a few almonds blanched and ground in a mortar with a little cold water, and then mixed, by little at a time, with two
<PB N="30" REF="31">thirds of milk from the cow, is &s;till bet|ter, where more nouri&s;hment is required. This admixture of almonds renders the curd, which &s;eparates in the &s;tomach, much le&s;s tenacious, and ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion. I mention cows milk, becau&s;e it is mo&s;t ea|&s;ily obtained; otherwi&s;e, a&s;&s;es milk is cer|tainly preferable, becau&s;e it contains much le&s;s of curd, which is both difficult of di|ge&s;tion, and putre&s;cent. Goat's milk con|tains even a greater proportion of curd than cows milk, and is therefore highly impro|per, though frequently pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Eggs are by no means to be allowed, on account of their putrefactive tendency. In &s;hort, animal food is in general to be a|voided; though, if the patient be weak, I allow a little boiled white meat once or twice a week, and now and then a little veal or chicken broth, with a &s;mall quanti|ty of lemon juice &s;queezed into it. Po|tatoes, turnips, carrots, par&s;neps, beans, &s;pinach, broccoli, &s;allets, bread and rice, con&s;titute our general bill of fare.</P>
<P>As to drink, if the patient has much hectic fever, I confine him entirely to al|mond milk, barley water, or milk and wa|ter; otherwi&s;e, be&s;ides the&s;e, he is per|mitted to drink one or two gla&s;&s;es of mountain wine every day; or, in ca&s;e that cannot be afforded, now and then a draught of ale, porter, or table beer.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<P>If the patient complain of a nau&s;ea, weight, or unea&s;ine&s;s at his &s;tomach, or|der him ten grains of Ipecacoanha, with chamomile tea, to be repeated once in ten days, or a fortnight, if the &s;ymptoms re|turn.</P>
<P>With regard to bleeding, as I expect no|thing more from it than a little pre&s;ent relief, I never order it, unle&s;s when the fever runs too high, and then I &s;eldom ex|ceed five ounces.</P>
<P>If the patient be co&s;tive, I order him a &s;olution of manna, with a little &s;oluble tartar; if the contrary, I give him occa&s;ionally a few drops of the Thebaic tincture in a little &s;imple cinnamon water.</P>
<P>If he &s;weat towards morning, which is often the ca&s;e, I order him to go to bed in good time, to ri&s;e very early, and to re|po&s;e a little after dinner. If his &s;weat &s;till continue, I give him 20 or 30 drops of the acid elixir of vitriol in a gla&s;s of cold water twice a day. As to the Peruvian bark on this occa&s;ion, I believe it to be an excellent medicine; but I di&s;like it in &s;ub|&s;tance for many rea&s;ons, and am no le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with all the known preparations of it. I have lately begun a cour&s;e of te|dious experiments, with an intention to di&s;cover the parts in which its virtues actu|ally re&s;ide, and to dive&s;t it of tho&s;e which are inert. If I am not much mi&s;taken in
<PB N="32" REF="33">my conjectures, it is po&s;&s;ible to conden&s;e its active principles into a very &s;mall compa&s;s, and thereby to render it a much more agreeable and efficacious medicine. If I &s;ucceed, po&s;&s;ibly the public may in &s;ome future t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">me expect to be made acquainted with the re&s;ult of my enquiries.</P>
<P>There remains yet one piece of advice, to which the patient, if he regard his own &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, will be particularly attentive. It concerns the po&s;ition of his body. Con|&s;umptive people, from an indolence pecu|liar to their di&s;order, are very apt, whether &s;itting, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lking, or riding, to &s;uffer the body to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd forward, for want of a pro|per exertion of tho&s;e mu&s;cles by which it &s;hould be kept erect. In this drooping po&s;ition the che&s;t is never &s;ufficiently en|larged, nor the lungs fully expanded. I therefore con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">antly advi&s;e my patients to keep them&s;elves upright, and, e&s;pecially when in the open air, to endeavour to bring their brea&s;t as forward as po&s;&s;ible. In this, my intention is, to expand the &s;mall ramifications of the <HI>bronchus</HI> to their extre|mities, and to open a free pa&s;&s;age for the blood from and to the heart; both which will a&s;&s;i&s;t our endeavours to remove ob|&s;tructions, and prevent tho&s;e adhe&s;ions of the lungs to the <HI>pleura</HI> which are gene|rally found on di&s;&s;ection of con&s;umptive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Morgagni, de Sedib, &amp; Cau&s;is Morborum.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="34">
<P>My a&s;thmatic patients, no doubt, begin to think me tedious, or rather imagine that I have quite forgot them. That, however, is not the ca&s;e. By an a&s;thma we mean that di&s;order, the chief &s;ymptom of which is a difficulty of breathing. It is either continued, or by fits. Now, though the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e is frequently in the lungs, yet it is &s;ometimes owing to a morbid af|fection of &s;ome of the other organs of re&s;piration, as the diaphragm, the inter|co&s;tal mu&s;cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, or the wind-pipe, or &s;ome of the neighbouring <HI>vi&s;cera.</HI> How it hap|pens that the bal&s;amic medicines, which are recommended as a cure for con&s;ump|tions, are at the &s;ame time recommended in a&s;thmatic complaints, is amazing, and mu&s;t proceed either from a con&s;ummate ig|norance, or unpardonable di&s;hone&s;ty. If, as we have &s;een above, the&s;e bal&s;amies, taken into the &s;tomach, can do nothing towards the cure of a con&s;umption, how much le&s;s likely are they to relieve an a&s;th|matic patient? For if they could even be ap|plied immediately to the part affected, they po&s;&s;e&s;s no one virtue that might authorize &s;uch expectation.</P>
<P>Hold! cries the reader, if that be the ca&s;e, how comes it that you recommend your bal&s;amic vapour for the cure of an a&s;thma? I an&s;wer, that unle&s;s the a&s;thma be a &s;ymptom of a con&s;umption, I expect
<PB N="34" REF="35">no advantage from the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;amic quality of this vapour. But when the cau&s;e of the a&s;thma is a &s;pa&s;modic contraction of the lungs, or wind-pipe, which is very fre|quently the ca&s;e, e&s;pecially when the di&s;|ea&s;e returns by fits, I then expert con&s;ider|able advantage from the anti&s;pa&s;modic pow|er of this vapour, and when in a continu|ed difficulty of breathing the cau&s;e of the di&s;order is an infarction of the lungs from vi&s;cid mucus, my hopes are then built on the attenuating power of the vapour ex|hibited in the manner I recommend. Let tho&s;e who are capable of rea&s;oning judge whether my expectations are well founded.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the peculiar con&s;ump|tive di&s;po&s;ition ob&s;ervable in the people of this kingdom is to be attributed to the in&s;tability of our climate, which renders us &s;o frequently liable to take cold. Now, as it is always better to prevent a di&s;order than to cure it, and as colds do no injury to the lungs, except in their remote effects, I thought it rational to &s;uppo&s;e, if imme|diately after taking cold I could dilute or obtund the acrimony of the humour which irritates and inflames the lungs, I &s;hould probably prevent the bad con&s;equences of ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, at lea&s;t as far as it concerned the lungs. Having my&s;elf late|ly taken a violent cold, I immediately be|gan to u&s;e the bal&s;amic vapour, by hold|ing
<PB N="27" REF="36" MS="y">my head over a common pint ve&s;&s;el, keeping my mouth generally &s;hut, that the &s;team might pa&s;s through my no&s;e, and repeating the operation &s;everal times a day, for two or three days. The con&s;equence of this was, that I very &s;oon got rid of my cold, without the lea&s;t cough or diffi|culty of breathing; which was really a re|markable circum&s;tance, becau&s;e my lungs are naturally &s;o irritable, that I hardly re|member ever to have had the lea&s;t degree of cold which did not end in a cough. This, however, is but a &s;ingle experiment; but I have another of greater weight.</P>
<P>Having founded my expectations, in the cure of con&s;umptions which are far ad|vanced, chiefly on the anti&s;eptic quality of this Aether, in order to try its power, I &s;u&s;pended from two nails, at the di&s;tance of about four feet from each other, two pieces of fre&s;h beef. Under one of the&s;e I held a ve&s;&s;el of hot water, into which fifteen drops of the medicine were drop|ped, repeating the operation three or four times every day, and continuing it about five minutes each time. To the other piece nothing was applied. I carefully ex|amined each piece every day, and was great|ly &s;urpri&s;ed to find, at the expiration of a month, that neither of them was, in the lea&s;t, tainted or di&s;coloured. That the piece to which the vapour was applied
<PB N="28" REF="37" MS="y">continued &s;weet did not at all &s;urpri&s;e me; but I own, I did not expect, that the anti&s;eptic power of this vapour was &s;o great, as to prevent putrefaction in the other piece of beef, by only mixing with the air in the room. Indeed the room was &s;mall. This unexpected event, however, gave me great plea&s;ure, as it immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to me the evident advantage that might be expected, in all putrid di&s;orders, from im|pregnating the air in the chamber with this vapour. For this purpo&s;e, it is my con&s;tant practice to order 30 or 40 drops to be dropped into a quart of boiling water, and the ve&s;&s;el to be placed near the bed of the patient, to be repeated three or four times a day; or the water to be kept boiling over a lamp, in any part of the room, till it is entirely evaporated, if the di&s;order be of a very putrid nature, and e&s;pecially in the &s;mall-pox. It were cer|tainly needle&s;s to mention the u&s;e of this vapour in &s;ore throats, whether inflam|matory or putrid.</P>
<P>The medicine is entitled <HI>Dr. Stern's Bal|samic Aether,</HI> and may be had, for &s;ix &s;hil|lings the bottle, of Mr. ALMON, in Picca|dilly, Mr. COOK, near the Royal Exchange, Mr. BLADON, in Pater-no&s;ter Row, Me&s;&s;rs.

<PB N="29" REF="38" MS="y">
<P>I &s;hall now, by way of conclu&s;ion, beg leave to give a few general rules to the reader, which may enable him to judge properly of medicines which are expo&s;ed to &s;ale. The&s;e rules &s;eem the more nece&s;|&s;ary, in an age when almo&s;t every week produces a new medicine.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> general rule is, never to pay the lea&s;t regard to the canting of tho&s;e who pretend, that the good of mankind is their &s;ole motive for offering their medi|cine to &s;ale.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> di&s;regard all a&s;&s;ertions concern|ing the excellency of a medicine, which are mere a&s;&s;ertions, without any founda|tion in rea&s;on and experiment.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> conclude the adverti&s;er to be either a knave, or a fool in phy&s;ic, who pretends, that his medicine will cure &s;eve|ral di&s;orders which have not the lea&s;t ana|logy to each other.</P>
<P>And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> when the doctor writes a pam|phlet, with an intention to recommend his medicine, if it betray a manife&s;t ignorance of his &s;ubject, of &s;tyle, and grammar; in &s;hort, when his language is evidently that of a porter; conclude him to be &s;ome illi|terate, ignorant per&s;on, who&s;e medicine and opinions de&s;erve no attention.</P>
<P>Concerning my&s;elf, and the medicine I recommend, I do not expect, that the reader &s;hould have any dependence on what I
<PB N="30" REF="39" MS="y">may have a&s;&s;erted in the preceding pages; becau&s;e, if he has any knowledge of man|kind, he has rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that I have &s;acrificed truth to intere&s;t and a fa|vourite hypothe&s;is. My a&s;&s;ertions however are very few, except what relates to the experiment to prove the anti&s;eptic quality of this vapour; but as it is in every one's power to repeat the experiment, it will be an ea&s;y matter to convict me of fal&s;ehood, or confirm the truth. All I expect of the reader is, that he will impartially con&s;ider the rea&s;ons upon which I have founded my expectations of curing di&s;orders of the lungs by means of this bal&s;amic vapour. If he be of opinion, that I have rea&s;oned ju&s;tly, he will certainly think it advi&s;eable for tho&s;e who&s;e lungs are injured to try the experiment, e&s;pecially as it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be attended with any danger; and as to the expence, it will certainly be thought mo&s;t incon&s;iderable, when compared with the fees of a phy&s;ician, and the bills of an apothecary.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX TO Dr. STERN'S MEDICAL ADVICE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE Con&s;umptive and A&s;thmatic People of England.</HEAD>
<P>MY opinion concerning the di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs, as contained in the fore|going treati&s;e, having been favourably re|ceived, I think it my duty to corroborate that opinion by a few additional con&s;iderations; and to lay before the public the rea&s;ons which fir&s;t induced me to depart from the u&s;ual method in my treatment of con&s;ump|tive and a&s;thmatic patients.</P>
<P>A con&s;umption of the lungs being pecu|liarly fatal to the inhabitants of this i&s;land, I became, early in life, uncommonly atten|tive to that di&s;order. I &s;aw with regret, from numberle&s;s examples, that of all the di&s;ea&s;es which afflict mankind, this &s;eemed to be lea&s;t in the power of the medical art; in&s;omuch, that I do not remember ever to have &s;een a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a con&s;umptive
<PB N="32" REF="41" MS="y">per&s;on cured by the u&s;ual method of prac|tice, even by the mo&s;t &s;kilful phy&s;icians. This naturally led me to conclude, that the means were inadequate to the end propo&s;ed. And indeed, when I began to con&s;ider the &s;tructure of the human body, and the &s;eat of the di&s;order, it &s;oon appeared to be almo&s;t as rational to expect to cure a con&s;umption by cly&s;ter, as by means of medicines taken into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>In con&s;ulting a variety of authors on this &s;ubject, I found &s;ome of them of my opi|nion; particularly our celebrated Dr. Mead, who in his <HI>Monita &amp; Praecepta Medica,</HI> &s;peaking of the &s;low or hectic fever, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to this effect: <Q>"Bal&s;ams are in &s;ome ca&s;es mo&s;t u&s;eful, in order to obtund and correct the acrid and &s;aline humours: The&s;e bal&s;ams are to be &s;prinkled upon live coals, and the vapour received into the lungs, by means of a tube adapted to the purpo&s;e. This medicine, I know, is generally thought to be of little utility, and is therefore neglected; but if we con&s;ider the long journey by which medicines taken into the &s;tomach are conveyed to the lungs, and how &s;mall a quantity of the&s;e medicines can po&s;&s;ibly reach the part for which they are intended, we cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that the method here propo&s;ed is mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer the end."</Q> In this
<PB N="33" REF="42" MS="y">pa&s;&s;age the Doctor refers to the <HI>Theatrum Tabidorum</HI> of Chri&s;topher Benedictus.</P>
<P>In a German book, entitled Medical and Chirurgical Ob&s;ervations, by F. H. L. My|zel, publi&s;hed at Berlin in 1754, I met with the following ca&s;e. The Doctor, from a variety of &s;ymptoms, concluding that his patient had a purulent <HI>vomica</HI> in the &s;ub&s;tance of his lungs, ordered a repetition of &s;timula|ting medicines, which in the end produced a rupture of the <HI>vomica,</HI> and di&s;charge of the purulent matter. The breath of the pa|tient, after this di&s;charge, became in&s;up|portably offen&s;ive. If the Doctor had in this ca&s;e proceeded in the u&s;ual method, he would have ordered a quantity of bal&s;amics to be taken in the common manner; but, with greater &s;agacity, he thought of putting a &s;top to the putrefaction by means of va|pour conveyed immediately to the part af|fected. With this intent, he ordered a ve&s;|&s;el, narrower at the top, to be filled with a pectoral decoction, with the addition of half an ounce of oil of turpentine. This ve&s;&s;el he immer&s;ed in boiling water, and cau&s;ed the patient to draw in the vapour with his breath four times a day. In two days his breath became much le&s;s offen&s;ive, the mat|ter which he &s;pit was of a better colour, and his appetite returned; and in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks his cough cea&s;ed, together with all his complaints.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="43" MS="y">
<P>There can be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to doubt the veracity of the author: we mu&s;t there|fore allow this to be an in&s;tance of putre|faction being &s;topped, and an ulcer in the lungs perfectly cured; which I verily believe is more than can be produced in favour of any medicine taken in the common way.</P>
<P>Many other medical writers of &s;ufficient authority have recommended the application of the native bal&s;ams immediately to the lungs; but I think they have all been mi&s;|taken in the mode of exhibition. The fumes of the&s;e bal&s;ams, when &s;prinkled upon live coals, are extremely acrid, and very un|fit for the purpo&s;e intended; whereas, in the method I have advi&s;ed, they are conveyed to the part affected, in a dilute and mild &s;tate, by means of an exceeding volatile fluid, which in it&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great virtues perfectly adapt|ed to the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion. But be&s;ides the native bal&s;ams, the medicine which I recommend to the public contains the re&s;in of a certain &s;ub&s;tance which I have found to be the mo&s;t powerful re&s;i&s;ter of putrefaction in nature. For this rea&s;on in particular, I &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;e not only tho&s;e who are con&s;umptively inclined, but all tho&s;e who are afflicted with any putrid di&s;order, &s;uch as malignant fevers, putrid &s;ore throats, &s;mall pox, &amp;c. to u&s;e this Aether frequently, and moreover to impregnate the air in the room,
<PB N="43" REF="44">by pouring a little of it into a ve&s;&s;el of boil|ing water, kept boiling by means of a &s;pirit-lamp. This will not only conduce greatly to die cure of the patient, but will &s;ecure tho&s;e, who are obliged to attend the &s;ick, from infection. If any one doubts the effect, let him try the experiment, and con|vince him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some time ago I received the following letter:</P>

<P>As this is the place where multitudes of a&s;th|matic and con&s;umptive people are &s;ent for relief, great enquiry is made after the treati&s;e lately publi&s;hed by Dr. Sterne, as al&s;o for his bal&s;amic aether, and the pewter ve&s;&s;el in which it is to be evaporated; but none of the book&s;ellers, or any of the phy&s;ical people here, except one, &s;eem to know any thing of it. It is therefore recom|mended to Mr. Almon to &s;end down by the next machine a quantity of all the above articles, and to adverti&s;e their being had at the &s;everal book|&s;ellers at Bath, as well as at this place, it be|ing imagined he might di&s;po&s;e of three times the quantity here in a &s;ea&s;on that he can at London, e&s;pecially if he has the title page of the book &s;tuck up at the Hot Wells, and at all the other u&s;ual places where new performances generally make their fir&s;t appearance; and the ve&s;&s;els ought to be &s;old where the medicines are to be had. Dr. D&mdash;, a phy&s;ician of great eminence here,
<PB N="44" REF="45">who has read the treati&s;e, &s;eems to think the u&s;e of your bal&s;amic aether no ways incompa|tible with the waters of this place.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In an&s;wer to this anonymous epi&s;tle I in|&s;erted an adverti&s;ement in the St. James's Chronicle, intimating, that if the author would be &s;o kind as to recommend a per&s;on proper to be intru&s;ted, a number of the pamphlets and medicine &s;hould be &s;ent down. Now whether he ever &s;aw the adverti&s;ement I cannot tell; but I heard no more from him. I am, however, much obliged to him for his information.</P>
<P>Some people having objected to the ex|pence of the machine recommended for the more convenient and effectual exhibition of the Bal&s;amic Aether, I take this method of informing them, that the medicine may be u&s;ed with &s;ufficient benefit by means of any common ve&s;&s;el which is narrow at the top, it being very ea&s;y to inhale a con&s;iderable quantity of vapour by that means. To tho&s;e, however, who can afford it, I &s;till recom|mend the urn, provided the extremity of the tube be &s;o wide as to admit the end of the little finger. I mention this, becau&s;e &s;everal of tho&s;e which I have &s;een have been too &s;mall.</P>
<P>It may not be improper likewi&s;e to inform tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;order is of long &s;tanding,
<PB N="45" REF="46">that they are not to expect a miraculous cure from a negligent or di&s;continued u&s;e of this medicine. No: I expect that they &s;hould repeat it at lea&s;t three or four times every day, and continue it at lea&s;t &s;ix weeks or two months. If after all it &s;hould prove ineffectual, and the ca&s;e be a confirmed con&s;umption, let them by all means try a &s;ix-weeks voyage to &s;ea. But they mu&s;t not on any account neglect the rules of diet laid down in the pamphlet to which this is an appendix.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE, and make no doubt but you will excu&s;e my troubling you with this. My rea&s;on for &s;o doing is, I am afflicted with a very bad a&s;thma. In May and June la&s;t, I was at the Hot Wells, Bri&s;tol, to try if the waters would be of any &s;ervice to me. They certainly were, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that famous phy&s;ician Dr. Renaudet. A few days before I left the Wells, I was advi&s;ed by an acquaintance to try Dr. Stern's Aether. Accordingly I went to your hou&s;e, and purcha&s;ed two phials of the Aether, and &s;everal other things in your bu&s;ine&s;s at the &s;ame time. Finding I received great bene|fit,
<PB N="47" REF="48">in a &s;hort time afterwards, I &s;ent for two more phials. They differed in re&s;pect to colour about three or four &s;hades; but that I did not &s;o much mind: now again I &s;ent for two more, by one of the coachmen belonging to the machines; and they differ from each other &s;o much, that one looks like fine &s;weet oil, the other like the deep|e&s;t vinegar: therefore I &s;hall e&s;teem it a great favour if you will oblige me with a letter, to inform me with the meaning why there &s;hould be that difference; otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t return them, being fearful, they may be counterfeited before they come to your hands. I &s;hould by no means have troubled you, had I known whom to apply to, be&s;ides the gentleman of whom I bought them. If it will not try your patience too much, I think it may be proper to acquaint you of the benefit which I have already re|ceived from the Aether. Fir&s;t, I &s;trictly ob&s;erved the Doctor's rules in his book of advice, then immediately applied the Aether. After I have given you the particulars of my &s;tate of health, you will be convinced of the benefit which I have received. I was entirely worn to a &s;hadow with the violence of the cough, and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;ore in my in&s;ide, that I could not &s;wallow a &s;ingle drop of any &s;ort of wine without mixing it in water, otherwi&s;e it would burn me like the &s;tronge&s;t dram. I have been
<PB N="48" REF="49">hoar&s;e for two years, &s;o that you could &s;carce hear me &s;peak. My &s;kin was very yellow, and I was &s;o very weak, that I could not &s;it on hor&s;eback. But now, thank God, I am &s;o well recovered, that I can drink a gla&s;s or two of wine a day, without any &s;ymptoms of &s;orene&s;s. My cough is greatly abated, and my voice infinitely better. I gain fle&s;h and &s;trength, &s;o that I am able to ride eight or ten miles a day without fatigue, and my complexion as well as ever. I mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly entreat, that you will &s;end your an|&s;wer by the return of the po&s;t, as I would by no means neglect the continuation of the Aether.</P>

<P>I AM infinitely obliged to you for your kind letters, and return many thanks for the trouble you have had on my account.

I make no doubt but the Doctor will in&s;ert my ca&s;e in more papers than one; therefore think it will be proper to acquaint him, that I have from London, the Craft&s;man, or Say's Weekly Journal.
