<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE TEETH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Teeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Formation,</NOTE> which are the hard|e&s;t and &s;moothe&s;t Bones of the Body, are formed within the Cavities of the Jaws. Above the Gums they are not covered by any Membrane, but within their Sockets are inve&s;ted with the common covering of all other Bones; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Perio&s;teum,</HI> a fine tran&s;parent Skin, ob&s;ervable in &s;craping any Bone, after the Meat is taken clean off.</P>
<P>The Number of Teeth in a grown Per&s;on are generally thirty-&s;ix; more or le&s;s according to Age, Con&s;titution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As they are not all formed at once, &s;o neither do they all appear at the &s;ame time; the la&s;t but one, of the great Teeth in each Jaw, 'tis remarkable, &s;el|dom appears 'till about the Age of twen|ty-one,
<PB N="2" REF="3">and the la&s;t, &s;ometimes not till that of forty.</P>
<P>Each Tooth is compo&s;ed of an in|ternal bony Sub&s;tance, and an exter|nal vitrious <HI>Cortex,</HI> of a &s;olid hard Con|&s;i&s;tence, and of the Colour of Ivory. The U&s;es of this glo&s;&s;y Sub&s;tance are to prevent the Teeth being worn by the Friction they undergo in Ma&s;tica|tion or Chewing; and to pre&s;erve their bony Sub&s;tance from the Air.</P>
<P>The different Shape and Series of the Teeth are &s;ufficiently obvious; the four front Teeth in each Jaw which are thin and broad, are called <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores</HI> or Cutters, from their cutting or dividing the Aliment. The <HI>Canini</HI> or Dog-teeth, which are two in each Jaw, are &s;o call|ed from their Re&s;emblance to the Tu&s;ks of a Dog; tho&s;e of the upper Jaw are by &s;ome, called the Eye-teeth, from the Communication of Nerves betwixt them and the Eyes; they are thick and round, terminating in a &s;harp Point, and like the <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores</HI> have but one Root, but are remarkably &s;trong, and of a greater Length than any of the re&s;t: Their proper U&s;e being to pierce and hold the
<PB N="3" REF="4">Aliment &s;teady when we bite it, as the front Teeth are very apt to be forced outwards by the Things we hold or break with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>large</HI> or <HI>double</HI> Teeth, are by Anatomi&s;ts called <HI>Molares</HI> or Grinders, from their U&s;e in grinding and making &s;mall our Aliment before it is &s;wallowed. They are ten in each Jaw; their Extremi|ties are broad and uneven, and becau&s;e the Pre&s;&s;ure upon them is perpendicular, they are provided with two or three, and &s;ometimes four Roots &s;eparated a little from one another, and inclining &s;omewhat outwards, that in chewing our Aliment the Pre&s;&s;ure may be le&s;s upon the Jaws, than if they run directly down|wards, and with only a &s;ingle Root.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Teeth, according to <HI>Hip|pocrates,</HI> are engendered in Time of Preg|nancy; this <HI>Urbain Hemard</HI> confe&s;&s;es he never could di&s;cover; he &s;ays, indeed, that having opened the Jaws of &s;ome Children three or four Days old, and others immediately at their Birth, he has found the <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores,</HI> the <HI>Canini,</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>Molares</HI> on each Side the Jaw in part o&s;&s;ified, and in part muci|laginous,
<PB N="4" REF="5">of a middling Size, and &s;ur|rounded with their little Alveoli.</P>
<P>However this may be, it is certain they do not appear, until &s;ome Time af|ter the Formation of the other Bones, notwith&s;tanding the Matter of which they are formed, is at the &s;ame Time in the Womb; and therefore <HI>Galen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De U&s;u Partium,</HI> Lib. ii. Chap. 3.</NOTE> writes, that he who would under&s;tand the Works of Nature, and ob&s;erve her Oeconomy in the Compo&s;ition of the human Body, ought not implicitly to rely on what he finds in Books, but rather what he &s;ees with his Eyes.</P>
<P>The Teeth are formed within the Ca|vities of the Jaws, which are lined with a thin Membrane, &s;upplied with &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, conveying a thick, vi&s;cous, tran&s;|parent Liquor, which as it increa&s;es, hardens into the Form of Teeth.</P>
<P>This tran&s;parent Humour appears fir&s;t in Form of a Mucus, afterwards a thin cortical <HI>Lamella,</HI> and &s;ome o&s;&s;ious <HI>Strata</HI> are perceived, with a large Cavity in the Middle, then gradually both the vitrious and bony Parts increa&s;e by the hardening of the Mucus, and Oppo&s;ition of new Matter.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>The o&s;&s;ious <HI>Strata</HI> are no other than a Separation of this fluid Matter, made by the &s;ame Membrane which covers the whole Cavity of the Jaw; and this Divi&s;ion forms two Lays, one below the other, the uppermo&s;t of which forms the Teeth which come out fir&s;t; but about the &s;eventh Year, <HI>they</HI> are thru&s;t out by the Teeth made at the undermo&s;t Lay, which then begin to &s;prout; if the&s;e latter be lo&s;t, they &s;eldom if ever grow again; &s;ome are indeed ob&s;erved to &s;hed their Teeth twice, which mu&s;t be owing to their having three Lays of this Matter.</P>
<P>The Teeth receive Nerves and Ve&s;&s;els at the Orifices of their Roots; it is the&s;e Nerves which are afflicted in the Tooth|ach, and which are frequently &s;hewn to the common People, by the ignorant among Tooth-drawers, for Worms; which they pretend would have eaten the whole Tooth in a &s;hort time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Part of the&s;e Nerves being always torn away with the Tooth drawn, it requires great Care to keep the Mouth warm un|till the Gum becomes clo&s;ed, and the Nerve defended from the Air.</P>
<P>This Orifice commonly clo&s;es about
<PB N="6" REF="7">the Age of thirty-five, which is the Rea&s;on why old People are not &s;o &s;ub|ject to the Tooth-ach as young.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Teeth perceived, are the <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores</HI> of the upper Jaw, then tho&s;e of the lower, the&s;e being the thinne&s;t and &s;harpe&s;t. After them appear the <HI>Ca|nini,</HI> and la&s;t of all the <HI>Molares.</HI></P>
<P>The general Opinion is, that the Teeth are connected to thin <HI>Alveoli,</HI> or Sockets, by that kind of Suture called <HI>Gompho&s;is,</HI> that is, like a Nail drove in|to a Piece of Wood; but this is proved to be fal&s;e by the following Experiment. If the Jaws be macerated in Water, for &s;ome Time, all the Teeth will drop out, which they would not do, if they were of the &s;ame Size of their <HI>Alveoli.</HI> From hence it appears, that it is by a <HI>Liga|ment,</HI> or by the Articulation called <HI>Syn|chondro&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>That the Teeth are joined to their Sockets by &s;ome means like this is evi|dent, for when a Tooth hath been drawn and replaced immediately, it hath taken root, and been as firm as ever, which could not have happened, had
<PB N="7" REF="8">not the Cavity been lined with a Mem|brane, which contained it.</P>
<P>After all that can be &s;aid concerning the Formation of the Teeth, nothing will &s;o much illu&s;trate the Tooth in Em|brio, as that called the Sweet-Tooth in a Calf, by which the Reader may form an Idea, not only of the Colour and Sub|&s;tance of the Mucus, or Juice u&s;ually &s;uck'd out, but of the <HI>Lamella</HI> or Shell|work it&s;elf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The U&s;e of the Teeth.</NOTE>The Teeth are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Man, that I conceive the greate&s;t Diffi|culty of his &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the younger part of his Life without them: Certain it is, that the &s;tronge&s;t Con&s;titution, would not be able to dige&s;t or &s;eparate a Quantity of Chyle &s;ufficient for the Nouri&s;hment of the Body for any con|&s;iderable Time, were the Aliment to be &s;wallowed whole and unprepared; for it is well known how much the chewing our Aliment contributes to the ea&s;y and expeditious Dige&s;tion of it, and con&s;equently to our Health. There are indeed many old People and others, who for want of Teeth are confined to a liquid Diet, &s;uch as Broths, Jellies,
<PB N="8" REF="9">Milk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Sake of an ea&s;y Di|ge&s;tion. To tho&s;e in old Age, I think &s;uch a Diet not only proper, but very nece&s;&s;ary; for Nature, by the Decay of Strength, the Lo&s;s of Teeth, and the gradual Diminution of our Sen&s;es, &s;eems to have appointed this Time, as a Re|turn to our primary Innocence; that we may make our Exit in &s;ome Mea&s;ure conformable with our Birth: And at this Time the Weakne&s;s of the Body generally renders it incapable of per|forming the natural Functions, and con|&s;equently of dige&s;ting &s;uch Meats, as before it had been accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>Upon a tran&s;ient Reflection we might imagine it injudicious of Nature to leave Age thus helple&s;s and unable to &s;upport it&s;elf, but upon a more careful Survey, we &s;hall find in this, as well as in all her Works, that her Oeconomy is ab|&s;olutely ju&s;t, and that every minute Va|riation of Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is important: Whenever we think otherwi&s;e, we ought always to &s;u&s;pect our Capacities of being too gro&s;s to comprehend the Sublimity of her Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of Teeth to an old Man, is in Fact but trifling, for the Human Body is &s;o providentially di&s;po&s;ed, that
<PB N="9" REF="10">as the natural Powers begin to le&s;&s;en i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Force and Action, the le&s;s is required in the Con&s;titution to maintain that Force and Action; and that a le&s;s Quantity of Chyle will better nouri&s;h and &s;upport Health in old Age, is a Truth every Anatomi&s;t is able to a&s;|&s;ert, for it is frequently &s;een in the Di&s;|&s;ections of the older Subjects, that ma|ny of the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ometimes Part of the larger al&s;o have been collap&s;|ed and grown up, &s;o as to reject the Fluid that u&s;ed to circulate through them: And this is one Rea&s;on why old People are mo&s;t &s;ubject to paralytic Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>If the Number of Ve&s;&s;els be dimini&s;h|ed, as in this Ca&s;e they certainly are, then is there the le&s;s required to fill them, and the Body is more ea&s;ily &s;up|ported than before, and from hence it is, that we can &s;o well di&s;pen&s;e with the Lo&s;s of Teeth when old: But when this Lo&s;s happens earlier in Life, I think it may ju&s;tly be deemed very great, &s;ince it is capable of depriving us of our Health, our Beauty, our Voice: Nor does the Inconveniency &s;top here, it proves of Detriment even to Society.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<P>If &s;uch exten&s;ive Effects appear &s;trange, let the Hu&s;bandman, &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to Society, be viewed in this State, and we &s;hall &s;oon be convinced, that the Want of Teeth is of greater Mo|ment than is commonly imagined: It would oblige him to live on a liquid Diet, by no means proper in <HI>his</HI> labo|rious Employ; for we are not the lea&s;t capable to &s;upport the continual Action of the Body (and which in his Bu&s;ine&s;s is almo&s;t violent) without proper Food; I mean &s;uch as will remain &s;ome Time in the Stomach and yield its Nouri&s;hment gradually to the lacteal Ve&s;&s;els, which receive and carry it to the Blood.</P>
<P>This is always performed by <HI>&s;uch</HI> Food either animal or vegetable. And if the Diet of the Labourer con&s;i&s;ted only of tho&s;e Juices exclu&s;ive of the Sub&s;tances, tho' the&s;e latter afford no Part of Nou|ri&s;hment, yet the Body would wa&s;te, the Fibres would become lax, the In|te&s;tines would lo&s;e their Tone, and a general Languor would &s;eize the whole Body; and if not relieved by a Change of Diet, a <HI>Diarrhea,</HI> Drop&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would be the certain Introduction to Death.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<P>The Con&s;equence of a liquid Diet is no where more obvious, than in the old <HI>&s;edentary Man,</HI> in whom, by an inac|tive Life, the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> are rendered weak, and the Vigour of the dige&s;ting Powers in a great Mea&s;ure lo&s;t for want of U&s;e. He is indeed better able to &s;upport Life than the working Man, as he is void of the Fatigue; but with what great Difficulty it is effected, may be &s;een in his pale lan|guid Countenance, his emaciated Bo|dy, and the Defect of Vigour in his Motion.</P>
<P>I cannot help reflecting in this Place on the general Error of Men fond of Study, who&s;e contemplative Geniu&s;es in|clining them to a Life, in other Re&s;pects full of Indolence and Neglect, they &s;up|po&s;e it agreeable to their Way of Life, to eat their Aliment liquid, and pre|pared for an expeditious Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Primae Viae;</HI> in this Method they &s;eem to imitate Birds and other Animals, which, in the room of Teeth, Nature has &s;upplied with two Stomachs. Where in the fir&s;t the Corn is only &s;welled and &s;oftened by the Liquor of its Glands, but broken and di&s;olved in the &s;econd; which is compo&s;ed of very &s;trong Mu&s;|cles.
<PB N="12" REF="13">This Oeconomy is wonderful in the Animal, but by no means applicable to the rational Creature. Although the Pot and other Implements u&s;ed in Cook|ery, where the Aliment receives &s;ome Degrees of Dige&s;tion, may bear &s;ome Analogy to the fir&s;t Stomach in the Ani|mal, yet the <HI>Operation</HI> is different, it is by the <HI>Succus Ga&s;tricus,</HI> a Liquor &s;epa|rated by the Glands of the Stomach, that the Corn is made &s;oft and fitted, to the Action of the &s;econd Stomach, where it is received together with the Juices of the fir&s;t. But in boiling, the mo&s;t nutrimental Parts are lo&s;t, the more volatile and &s;piritous evaporate, while the gro&s;s fatty Parts are blended with the Water.</P>
<P>Therefore whoever takes down the Sub&s;tance loads the Stomach to very little Purpo&s;e, and whoever drinks the Broth will relax his Stomach, and rob it of the Vigour required to perform its Office. But nothing will &s;o much con|vince us of the Impropriety of &s;uch a Regimen, as a Knowledge of Dige&s;tion, and the Manner of its being performed; which for the Sake of &s;uch Readers as are unacquainted with the&s;e Subjects
<PB N="13" REF="14">we will take a cur&s;ory View of in its fir&s;t Stages.</P>
<P>The principal Agents employed in this Action, are the Teeth, the Saliva, the <HI>Succus Ga&s;tricus,</HI> and the Liquors we drink. The Aliment being broke by the Teeth, and mixed with the Saliva in the Mouth, de&s;cends into the Stomach, where it imbibes the Juices of the Glands, and the Liquors drank, who&s;e chief Property is to &s;often the Aliments, as they are Fluids which ea&s;ily enter the Pores of moi&s;t Bodies, and, &s;welling them, break their mo&s;t intimate Cohe&s;ions; and this is augmented by the <HI>Impetus</HI> which the Heat of the Stomach gives to the Particles of the Fluids; and likewi&s;e by rarefying the Air contained in the Pores of our Food, which bur&s;ts its Parts a&s;under.</P>
<P>The Aliments thus prepared, their Parts &s;oon &s;eparate from one another, and di|&s;olve into a Fluid with the Liquor of the Stomach, by the continual Motion of its Sides, who&s;e ab&s;olute Power is demon|&s;trated (by <HI>Pitcairn</HI>) to be equal to the Pre&s;&s;ure of 117088 Pound-weight: To which if we add the ab&s;olute Force of the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> and Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Ab|domen,</HI> which likewi&s;e conduce to Di|ge&s;tion,
<PB N="14" REF="15">the Sum will amount to 250734 Pound-weight.</P>
<P>From whence this Force? Or for what Purpo&s;e hath Nature (who yet hath ne|ver been detected in an Error) employed all this Mechani&s;m, if u&s;ele&s;s? There can be no Occa&s;ion to &s;pare it the Trouble of its Office, and the only Excu&s;e Men find for &s;o doing, is becau&s;e 'tis already weakened by &s;ome Cau&s;e, and incapable of acting. But to &s;uch I would ob&s;erve, that 'tis not by the&s;e Means to be brought to its natural Tone. And the &s;tudious Man, who&s;e Life is generally inactive, will find it more to his Advantage, and agreeable to the Con&s;titution of his Nerves, on who&s;e Sen&s;ation he de|pends for his Ideas, to live more upon Food containing the natural Juices, of which Kind e&s;pecially are all roa&s;ted Meats.</P>
<P>I could not conveniently treat on this Subject without mentioning Dige&s;tion, &s;ince the Teeth are the fir&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Organs of it. Wherever we ob&s;erve the&s;e In&s;truments wanting in Animals, &amp;c. we &s;hall always find them furni&s;hed with
<PB N="15" REF="16">two Stomachs; and where they have Teeth be&s;ides, they are only u&s;ed as Weapons of Defence, which we &s;ee in the Viper, and &s;ome Kinds of Fi&s;h, who &s;wallow their Prey whole.</P>
<P>From hence we may conclude, that the Teeth, be&s;ides their Importance for the Pre&s;ervation of our Health, are like|wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for the Agreement of the Voice, the Pronunciation and Articula|tion of our Words, and the Ornament of the Face.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Precau|tions for pre&s;erv|ing the Teeth.</NOTE>Tho' the Production of the Teeth is entirely the Work of Nature, the Pre&s;er|vation of them depends greatly upon our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Men are naturally attentive to their Health, but by a Neglect of this Kind they are too often rendered incapable of attaining it: For, as I have before &s;hewn, the Health depending on the Dige&s;tion of the Aliments, which ought fir&s;t to be pounded as it were, and broke for the ea&s;ier Admi&s;&s;ion of the Juices of the Stomach: And this being the Office of the Teeth, it intimately concerns us
<PB N="16" REF="17">to keep them in &s;uch Order as will enable them to perform it.</P>
<P>The Means to pre&s;erve them, con&s;i&s;ts then principally in the Choice of a good Regimen, and avoiding the U&s;e of &s;uch Things as are hurtful to their external Parts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t you &s;ee will not only pre&s;erve the Teeth, but at the &s;ame Time the Health al&s;o, as it con&s;i&s;ts in the Choice of &s;uch Aliment as will yield a good Nouri&s;hment. But the Generality of People are &s;o prone to Intemperance, and eat with &s;o little Attention, or rather &s;o precipitately, that too much cannot be &s;aid of its ill Effects. Nothing is capable of producing greater Di&s;orders, than an imperfect Ma&s;tication; for if the Ali|ment be not well broken by the Teeth, 'tis certain the Di&s;&s;olution in the Stomach will be long, laborious, and imperfect. And the &s;weet bal&s;amic Blood, will be changed into a thick, acrid, and vi&s;|cous State. And this Alteration cannot fail of producing a bad Effect in the Teeth, not only as it circulates thro' them, but by the Vapours which ari&s;e from the Stomach and Breath, and
<PB N="17" REF="18">lodge upon them as they pa&s;s thro' the Mouth.</P>
<P>The too great U&s;e of Vegetables, as al&s;o the Fle&s;h of Pork, &s;alted Meats, Salt-fi&s;h, Chee&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t be preju|dicial, as they all produce a bad Chyle.</P>
<P>All Kinds of Sweet-meats and Sugars contribute very much to the De&s;truction of the Teeth; becau&s;e their gluey Juice is in&s;inuated into the Gums, and &s;ticks to the Teeth; be&s;ides, Sugars are of an acid, penetrant, and corro&s;ive Nature, and by a <HI>Chymical Analy&s;is</HI> we &s;ee that the Effects will be &s;ooner or later per|nicious. 'Tis al&s;o remarkable that tho&s;e People who make great U&s;e of this Poi|&s;on, are more &s;ubject to the Tooth-ach, and lo&s;e their Teeth &s;ooner than others.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who love Sugar, and u&s;e it frequently, are &s;eldom remarkable for hand&s;ome Teeth, and very rarely good ones. This is particularly exemplified in <HI>Holland,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof, e&s;pecially the Women, are great Tea-drinkers, and in their Manner &s;ome|what particular, for in&s;tead of &s;weetning each Di&s;h with Loaf-Sugar as in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="19">they hold a Piece of Sugar-Candy in their Mouths, which frequently &s;erves &s;ix or eight Di&s;hes before 'tis di|&s;olved, which inevitably produces tho&s;e Effects to which they are &s;o &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lo&s;s and Ruin of their Teeth: For 'tis rare to find a <HI>Dutch</HI> Woman of thirty Years of Age with a good Set of Teeth: For this Rea&s;on, after eating Sugar, or any Thing that contains much Sugar in its Compo&s;ition, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to rince the Mouth with warm Water, to di&s;&s;olve and wa&s;h away tho&s;e Parts which would &s;tick to the Gums and Teeth.</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd from hence to conclude it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to de|prive our&s;elves of the&s;e Things, but to regulate their U&s;e; and not to make a Habit of that which Experience &s;hews to be prejudicial mo&s;t certainly is worth our Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Of no le&s;s Importance is Mode|ration in Drinking, &s;ince our Health is equally dependant on Sobriety; the ma|ny Con&s;titutions we &s;ee ruined by Ex|ce&s;s of this Kind, is a &s;tronger Argument
<PB N="19" REF="20">to deter us than any Thing that can be further &s;aid on this Head.</P>
<P>'Tis as nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e to avoid chewing or breaking any hard Bodies, as Nuts, Cherry-&s;tones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> biting off the Ends of Thread or Silk, lifting up great Weights, picking them with In|&s;truments of Gold, Silver, or any other Metal, by which they may be either loo&s;ened or lo&s;t, and other &s;uch idle and pernicious Practices.</P>

<P>'Tis very evident that Mercury, by its ill Effects, &s;wells the Gums and renders them &s;ore; this it does al&s;o to the Mem|branes that cover the Roots of the Teeth, either internally or externally; it de|&s;ects, if I may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;i|on, the very Roots, and throws them out of their Sockets, or otherwi&s;e, it

<P>'Tis by the Effects produced from the&s;e Cau&s;es, that the Teeth are attended with &s;uch Diver&s;ity of Di&s;ea&s;es, almo&s;t al|ways accompanied with Pain, more or le&s;s violent.</P>
<P>Authors have reckoned the Number of Di&s;ea&s;es of the Teeth to amount to upwards of an hundred, but I find on|ly nineteen nece&s;&s;ary to comprehend all that may be u&s;eful to know, and the&s;e may be divided into three Cla&s;&s;es: In the fir&s;t are tho&s;e produced by external Cau&s;es; in the &s;econd are contained the Di&s;orders of the Alveoli and Gums;
<PB N="27" REF="28">and in the third are the Di&s;ea&s;es acci|dental or &s;ymptomatic.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Tartar or Turf.</NOTE>The fir&s;t Di&s;ea&s;e from external Cau&s;es worth our Notice is, the Tartar or Turf, concerning which Authors &s;peak of many different Sorts, as the yellow, the grey, the black, and the petrified, and di&s;tingui&s;h them al&s;o by their Degrees of Con&s;i&s;tence; but as this la&s;t is owing only to the Duration, and the Difference of Colour not mate|rial, I &s;hall &s;peak only of the mo&s;t com|mon Sort, which is of a dark yellow, tending rather to a brown Colour.</P>
<P>The Tartar is a Matter accumulated on the Surface of the Teeth, near the Gums, which in Proce&s;s of Time will form a &s;trong Cru&s;t, of a con&s;iderable Bigne&s;s, common to tho&s;e who are ne|gligent in keeping their Teeth clean. This foreign Matter as it increa&s;es in Quan|tity, inevitably con&s;umes the Gums, and by that Means occa&s;ions a Rottenne&s;s of the Teeth.</P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding the Na|ture of this Tartar, with the Cau&s;es
<PB N="28" REF="29">that produce it, and the Manner of its in&s;en&s;ible Formation, the two following Principles may be of Service.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t the Foundation of this Matter and its Increa&s;e may bear &s;ome Analo|gy to the Stones formed in the Kidneys, Bladder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which owe their Origin very often to a Retention of &s;ome Mat|ter, capable of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Cohe&s;ion:</HI> The &s;mall Portions of our Aliment that adhere to the upper Part of the Teeth, or betwixt their Inter&s;tices, being &s;oft|ened by the Saliva, become of a gluey Con&s;i&s;tence, which &s;oon grows dry, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of more Air, pa&s;&s;ing in In&s;piration and Expiration.</P>
<P>Secondly, when the Saliva becomes vi&s;cous, from a Deprivation of the Lymph, and is loaded with &s;aline Par|ticles, 'tis very probable that it may be lodged upon the Body of the Teeth, and by Degrees form the Ma&s;s we are &s;peaking off. That this Matter may be &s;o cau&s;ed, I am the more ready to be|lieve from the Ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Journal de Saeavans de lannle, <HI>1721.</HI></NOTE> of a &s;trong
<PB N="29" REF="30">Concretion being found upon the Roots of the Tongue, formed by a vi&s;cous Lymph, re&s;embling the Saliva in Thir&s;t. 'Tis difficult to a&s;&s;ign any other Cau&s;e than that the Saliva may become tar|tarous and form this Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Lay or Bed of Tartar be|ing once formed, 'tis ea&s;y to conceive it augmented by the Addition of fre&s;h Matter, and to increa&s;e to an extraordi|nary Size.</P>
<P>From the Nature of this Di&s;ea&s;e we may readily infer, that the Cure, or Means to prevent it, will con&s;i&s;t in keep|ing &s;uch a Regimen as will pre&s;erve the Purity of the Blood in its natural State; and by being careful to wa&s;h the Mouth often, (which is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prevent a &s;tinking Breath oc|ca&s;ioned as well by this Neglect as the Di&s;order here mentioned) we may main|tain the U&s;e and Beauty of our Teeth, for many Years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jaundice</HI> of the Teeth is men|tioned as another Di&s;ea&s;e; but I think with Impropriety, it being nothing more than a tarni&s;hed Sub&s;tance, or Vi&s;co&s;ity
<PB N="30" REF="31">&s;ticking to the Teeth, like Du&s;t, or the Humidity that covers the Surface of a Looking-gla&s;s when 'tis not kept clean; and to me it &s;eems to be nothing more than a Bed or Lay of Matter, form|ing the Tartar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen&s;ibility and Agace|ment.</NOTE>The Sen&s;ibility and Agacement of the Teeth, are Di&s;orders produced from external Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The Writers on this Subject have been of oppo&s;ite Opinions, &s;ome main|taining the Teeth to be in&s;en&s;ible Bodies, others on the contrary making them ex|tremely capable of Sen&s;ation. 'Tis true that &s;imply as &s;o many Bones, we may con&s;ider them as in&s;en&s;ible; but as co|vered and lined with Membranes, and furni&s;hed with Ve&s;&s;els and Nerves, we cannot deny them the Quality of Sen&s;a|tion, any more than other Parts of the Body.</P>
<P>By the Sen&s;ibility of the Teeth is to be under&s;tood that fixed and permanent Pain, that we generally expre&s;s by &s;ay|ing we have the Tooth-ach.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<P>By the Agacement of the Teeth is meant that acute Pain we expre&s;s by &s;aying they are &s;et on Edge, cau&s;ed by certain Sounds, &s;uch as the touching of Stuffs, the &s;lipping of a Knife or Fork upon a China-Plate, or the filing a Piece of Iron, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Pains of the Teeth are of diffe|rent kinds: But the mo&s;t general are tho&s;e called <HI>pungent</HI> or pricking, com|ing by Intervals; the other <HI>di&s;ten&s;ive</HI> or continual, &s;uch as accompany a Caries, in which the Air by drying or cri&s;ping the Fibres, Nerves and Coats of the little Ve&s;&s;els, render them bony, and contract their Diameters too &s;mall to re|ceive any Fluid thro' them, by which Means the Efforts of the Humours, to di&s;tend their Orifices, cau&s;e that Pain we call di&s;ten&s;ive.</P>
<P>If on the contrary the little Ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be ruptured, the Liquor extrava|&s;ated would &s;oon change its Nature, and fermenting would irritate the Mem|branes, and produce the Pain called pungent.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="33">
<P>The Agacement we find to be a dif|ferent Kind of Sen&s;ation, owing, ac|cording to the general Opinion, to an acid Juice, in&s;inuated betwixt the Fibres of the Membranes, that covers the Roots of the Teeth; and when the Teeth are compre&s;&s;ed again&s;t this Mem|brane, that Di&s;po&s;ition occa&s;ions the Action of the Juices again&s;t the Fibres of the Membrane.</P>
<P>I believe that the Juices of certain Fruits, &s;uch as Cherries, Goo&s;eberries, Apples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be in&s;inuated betwixt the Inter&s;tices of the Fibres that com|po&s;e the Membranes, and di&s;tending them, intercept the Cour&s;e of the Li|quors in &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els, and by &s;tretch|ing the Nerves, produce a Sen&s;ation more or le&s;s trouble&s;ome to bear: But 'tis very different from that &s;eated in the Body of the Tooth.</P>
<P>What makes me con&s;ider that the Agacement is fixed only to the Body or Surface of the Teeth is, if they are wiped with a Piece of warm Linen, it will immediately dimini&s;h their Unea&s;i|ne&s;s. And in Oppo&s;ition to the Opini|on of an Acid being the Cau&s;e, the
<PB N="33" REF="34">following Experiment will &s;erve to con|vince: If the Herb Sorrel be chewed between the Teeth, the Agacement will &s;uddenly cea&s;e; if this Di&s;ea&s;e be oc|ca&s;ioned by an Acid, is it not &s;trange that it &s;hould admit of this Remedy? Sorrel which is it&s;elf an Acid, mu&s;t ra|ther increa&s;e than abate the Di&s;order! 'Tis po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome Parts of the Juice may be &s;ubtle enough to penetrate the Fibres that terminate it: But how Sor|rel acts in remedying this Evil, I con|fe&s;s, I am not able to conceive. We may ob&s;erve that the Air taken in Re|&s;piration when the Mouth is half open, will produce the &s;ame Effect: And I cannot believe that Air in pa&s;&s;ing, pre&s;|&s;es &s;o forcibly as to make that Compre&s;|&s;ion again&s;t the Membranes at the Roots of the Teeth, which they a&s;&s;ign to be the Cau&s;e. 'Tis more natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ubtle Particles of the Air en|tering the Pores of the Enamel, and the Re&s;i&s;tance made to the gro&s;&s;er Parts, may occa&s;ion a Tremor in the Tooth, and a Sen&s;ation not unlike the Agace|ment.</P>
<P>The Caries or Rottenne&s;s is a Di&s;ea&s;e produced likewise from external Causes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rottenness.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="34" REF="35">
<P>The Teeth are more &s;ubject to this Di&s;ea&s;e, than all the other Bones in the Body, both by their Structure and Situ|ation.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e is occa&s;ioned by a Hu|mour in&s;inuated between the boney Fi|bres of the Teeth, which generally meets with Ob&s;tructions in the mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial Part of the Tooth, and by the particular Impul&s;e, that every Particle communicates to the Cells of the Tooth, by Degrees, breaks off little Parcels, and in Time, makes that dark Cavity in the Tooth which we call <HI>hollow.</HI></P>
<P>The Teeth are more &s;ubject to Rot|tenne&s;s than the other Bones, becau&s;e their Perio&s;teum is more pre&s;&s;ed; which renders them &s;ubject to Ob&s;tructions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Molares</HI> are more &s;ubject to this Di&s;ea&s;e than the <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores</HI> or <HI>Cani|ni;</HI> and the <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores</HI> and <HI>Canini</HI> of the upper Jaw, more than tho&s;e of the lower Jaw, becau&s;e by their Situation they are more expo&s;ed to Heat and Cold, in eating or drinking, in In&s;piration and Expiration.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="36">
<P>It often happens, that after a Tooth is attack'd with a Caries, the oppo&s;ite Tooth, on the other Side of the &s;ame Jaw, is affected al&s;o. Nor does it appear that this Effect depends only upon Haz|ard: For 'tis remarkable, that in the oppo&s;ite Tooth the Caries will not only much re&s;emble the other, but &s;ometimes be exactly uniform to it.</P>
<P>The Vulgar, as well as certain Au|thors, are of opinion, that all Pains of the Teeth are cau&s;ed by a Worm, that gnaws and eats the Membranes and Nerves of the Teeth. This Notion is founded upon pretended Experiments on the&s;e Infects, which (as they report) by &s;moaking Hembane, will fall from the Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;ome of the <HI>Doctors of Montpellier</HI> have been very prolix in their Accounts of the Genera|tion of the&s;e Worms; be&s;ides the Di&s;|coveries with their Gla&s;&s;es: But who|ever will be at the Pains to make &s;ome Trials with the Micro&s;cope, may prove the Ab&s;urdity of this Notion.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
<P>The Time in which the Caries ra|vages mo&s;t of the Teeth, is between the Age of 25 and 50 Years.</P>
<P>I have omitted the many Divi&s;ions that may be &s;een in &s;ome Books upon this Subject; both on Account of their Perplexity and Non-u&s;e. For the Ca|ries, of what Kind or Cau&s;e &s;oever, pro|duces its Effects, more or le&s;s con&s;ider|able, according to the Parts of the Tooth they attack. And the Operations practi&s;ed on the&s;e Occa&s;ions are more or le&s;s difficult, according to the Situation of the Tooth; or according as the Ca|ries is more or le&s;s penetrating in the Body, or the Roots of the Teeth.</P>
<P>Whenever the Caries is &s;ituated with|out the Gums, either on the Sides, or Extremity of the Tooth, the Cure will con&s;i&s;t in &s;eparating the rotten Part from the &s;ound, by Exfoliation, with the File, the Rugine, Cautery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And by fill|ing the Cavity with Wax (which mu&s;t be often renewed) it will defend the boney and nervous Parts from the Air, or the Impre&s;&s;ion of any other Bodies; likewi&s;e hinder any Bits of our Aliment
<PB N="37" REF="38">from lodging in the Cavity, which are &s;o apt to putrify and cau&s;e a &s;tinking Breath.</P>
<P>Altho' the Teeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fractures.</NOTE> in their natural Situation, are harder and more compact than the other Bones in the Body, and more remarkably &s;o in the human Specie than Brutes, we find them by Experience extremely &s;ubject to break; e&s;pecially when the lea&s;t Defect happens in them.</P>
<P>Their Fractures, are &s;imple, compound, or Fi&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Simple happens often by Falls and Blows, particularly by the Attempts to draw them before they are loo&s;e: The Compound is when, their Roots are &s;trongly attached to their Alveoli, and a Piece of the Jaw comes away with Part of the Tooth: A Fi&s;&s;ure is a Fracture lengthways, without any &s;eeming Alte|ration in the Form of the Tooth.</P>
<P>When once the Parts of the other Bones are divided, they never can be again united; for the Ve&s;&s;els di&s;tributed in them are not &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to furni&s;h a Juice &s;ufficient, or that is capable of a Glutination; becau&s;e their proper Sub|&s;tance
<PB N="38" REF="39">is too compact to give them Pa&s;|&s;age; or their Motion, the Air, and Bodies that they touch, are Ob&s;tacles that oppo&s;e the Re-union of the divided Parts.</P>
<P>But tho' the Re-union of the Fracture be impracticable, the Scales, or Splinters, that remain, may be extracted, or their Angles and &s;harp Points &s;moothed and poli&s;hed.</P>
<P>All the Luxations the Bones &s;uffer in their Articulations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luxations.</NOTE> are either complete, or incomplete. When a Tooth is loo&s;ened, it is a Luxation incomplete.</P>
<P>If after having been naturally well &s;ituated, they lean either in, or out of the Mouth, of one Side, or the other, they are &s;o many Luxations.</P>
<P>When a Tooth turns in the Alveoli, &s;o that the lateral Parts of the Tooth incline, either outwards or inwards, 'tis a Luxation complete.</P>
<P>When a Tooth &s;eems to be longer, and exceed the others, that the Neck and Part of the Roots appear above the Edge of the Gums, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome
<PB N="39" REF="40">Matter contained in the Alveoli, 'tis a Semi-luxation.</P>
<P>The large Teeth are mo&s;t frequently luxated inwards. The <HI>Inci&s;&s;ores,</HI> on the contrary, generally luxate outwards: Altho' both the&s;e Di&s;locations are bad, and incommode the Equality of Ma&s;ti|cation, yet the Luxation inwards is the wor&s;t, becau&s;e it fatigues and hurts the Tongue; which Unea&s;ine&s;s is more than the Inconvenience that is cau&s;ed by the Teeth again&s;t the Lips, or Cheeks, when they fall outwards. The lea&s;t inconve|nient Luxation is, when the Tooth is only turned in the Cavity of the Alveoli.</P>
<P>When the Teeth are luxated, in &s;uch a manner as to exceed the others by their Extremities, which we call a Luxa|tion, or Di&s;location of the Bottom to the Top of the lower Jaw, or of the Top to the Bottom of the upper Jaw, the Ma&s;ti|cation is very difficult.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Remedy is, to return them, each, in their proper Places, by which means they will often become quite fa&s;t; to guard again&s;t the Cau&s;es of Luxations, and &s;o fortify the Gums.</P>

<HEAD>On the Methods of Cleaning the Teeth with Ob&s;ervations on Sca|ling.</HEAD>
<P>THE common Methods for pre|&s;erving the Colour of the Teeth, &s;erve rather to blacken and de&s;troy them: And I would caution the Public again&s;t the U&s;e of all Remedies &s;old with this De&s;ign; The Opiates, and many Medicines of different Titles, to my certain Knowledge, are compo&s;ed of Brick, China, Rotten-&s;tone, or other Ingredients of this Nature, powdered or levigated very fine, and coloured ac|cording to the Fancy of the Inventors. It is very natural to conceive that the&s;e Powders mu&s;t act upon the Teeth much in the &s;ame manner as a File, or the Du&s;ts u&s;ed in poli&s;hing Metals; by which means the enamel'd Sub&s;tance will be wore away, and the long Part of the Tooth left bare, and defencele&s;s to all In&s;ults.</P>
<P>The white Salt, Scuttle-fi&s;h Bone, Salt of Tartar, Salt of Lead, Burnt-al|lum,
<PB N="43" REF="44">and other Ingredients of the &s;ame Species, the World has been long abu&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Juice of Sorrel, Juice of Lemons, Spirit of Allum, Spirit and Salt of Vi|triol, have been employed on this Occa|&s;ion, and tho' with the greate&s;t Circum|&s;pection, have always in the End given them a yellow Colour, never to be re|paired. Nor is this the only bad Effect produced by the&s;e Liquors, for by a fre|quent Application, they corrode, and eat little Holes in the Enamel of the Teeth: Notwith&s;tanding it is in the U&s;e of the&s;e Remedies that con&s;i&s;t all the Secrets of our Quacks! and if we examine the Teeth of any of their Confidents (that &s;eem to have reaped the greate&s;t Advan|tage from them) with a Micro&s;cope, or even with the naked Eye, the Ravage they have made will ea&s;ily &s;hew us a &s;ure Foundation for a Caries.</P>
<P>The Methods of cleaning the Teeth are various. Mo&s;t People u&s;e &s;mall Bru&s;hes, or Bits of Cloth or Linen, without any Su&s;picion of their Im|propriety, but they are much too rough, and by frequent indi&s;creet U&s;e,
<PB N="44" REF="45">often ruin the Gums and Teeth. For this rea&s;on I would aboli&s;h their U&s;e, and ad|vi&s;e a Piece of Spunge, dipped in warm Water, in which &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved a Piece of Soap, to be u&s;ed preferable to all other Methods whatever. Soap is known to be of a penetrating, attenuating and detergent Nature, and therefore not only mo&s;t proper for cleaning the Teeth, but al&s;o very &s;erviceable in mo&s;t Di&s;or|ders of the Gums; in &s;hort, it may be u&s;ed with the utmo&s;t Propriety; the on|ly Objection to be made, is the Offence it may give on account of its Ta&s;te: but Cu&s;tom will render it familiar, and &s;uffi|ciently recompen&s;e die Trouble of u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>I would recommend the Morning as the mo&s;t convenient Time for cleaning the Teeth; but before u&s;ing of the Spunge, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;crape off the gluey Sub&s;tance, which adheres to their Surface, with a Quill; and after clean|ing them with the Spunge and Soap, the Mouth may be rinced with Hun|gary Water, Spirit of Lavender, &amp;c. diluted with warm Water.</P>
<P>The, Scurvy of the Gums is dependent
<PB N="45" REF="46">on the bad State of the Con&s;titution, the relieving of which la&s;t will infallibly cure the other. When the Teeth become loo&s;e, from whatever Cau&s;e, a Tea|&s;poonful of the <HI>Tincture of Myrrh,</HI> mixed with a Tea-cup-full of Water, to wa&s;h the Mouth with twice or thrice a Day, will be the mo&s;t efficacious Remedy.</P>
<P>'Tis become a great Fa&s;hion with the Engli&s;h Ladies, (and with too many of my own Sex) to have their Teeth &s;ea|led; and this Practice, &s;hocking as it is, &s;eems to be pur&s;ued with an uncommon Attention.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this Operation is to beautify the Colour of the Teeth, by re|moving the Tartar or Turf, which ad|heres to their Surface, and is done with Iron In&s;truments, made for that Purpo&s;e. But whoever will con&s;ider attentively the Nature of the Teeth, and of this petrified Sub&s;tance, which I have already de&s;cri|bed, will readily conceive the Impro|priety of this Practice. 'Tis very proba|ble that by endeavouring to detach this Matter, &s;ome of the enamel'd Part may be taken away with it; and this not only depends on Hazard, but is the certain
<PB N="46" REF="47">Con&s;equence of frequent U&s;e; indeed the&s;e In&s;truments them&s;elves, by often rubbing upon the Vitrious Sub&s;tance, mu&s;t ri&s;que its Ruin, both as they are of a Nature too hard to approach the Teeth, and as their Mettalic Particles will in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the Pores of the Enamel, and never fail to produce great Michief.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid that this Matter may be removed by a dextrous Hand, one familiar in the Operation, without any &s;uch Dangers, a brief Repetition of the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e will, I hope, prove a &s;ufficient An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Tartar is generally accumulated on that Part of the Teeth which joins with the Gums, and covers more or le&s;s, according as it encrea&s;es in Quan|tity, that Part we call the Neck of the Tooth, which it &s;eparates from the Gum. This is the true State of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e the Operator ever &s;o dextrous, he mu&s;t, in Con&s;equence of taking away this Matter, expo&s;e the Neck of the Tooth bare, and liable to all Inju|ries of the Air, the Aliment, or what|ever comes near it; in which are contain|ed
<PB N="47" REF="48">many Cau&s;es of a Caries. This Mat|ter when left to it&s;elf, &s;eldom fails of dropping off in&s;en&s;ibly, and if 'tis the Colour only which induces us to try the Remedy, 'twould be much better to be content with this Inconvenience, than &s;ubject our&s;elves to its ill Effects. But by following the Methods I have advi&s;ed, there will be no nece&s;&s;ity for expo&s;ing our&s;elves to this Operation.</P>
<P>A certain Merchant in, the City, tho' otherwi&s;e &s;ufficiently covetous, be&s;tow|ed a con&s;iderable Pur&s;e upon one of our foreign Operators; who had in good Truth changed the Colour of his Teeth, from a Black to a very beautiful White: But behold the Con&s;equence! The Mer|chant found him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of be&s;peakihg a new Sett; for they all actually fell out, one after the other: I &s;aw him within three Months after the Operation, when he had only two remain|ing in his Head. This is an In&s;tance not without its Precedent.</P>
<P>Thus it is that our curious Ladies and others, by endeavouring (by the&s;e unatural Means) to make their Teeth exceeding-white, will at length bring on
<PB N="48" REF="49">a Caries, and render them black and frightful as well as u&s;ele&s;s. I am a&s;to|ni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;o many pretending an Aver&s;ion to Foreigners, and yet &s;uffer them (as we &s;ay of Sharpers, &amp;c.) to draw the furthe&s;t Teeth in their Heads, And I am &s;till more &s;orry to &s;ee &s;uch numbers of the fine&s;t Women become the Dupes of &s;uch foreign Mi&s;creants.</P>

<HEAD>Di&s;ea&s;es of Children in the Time of Toothing.</HEAD>
<P>THE Teeth hardly make their Ap|pearance in the Mouth before they require &s;ome Succour from Surgery: The Caries is the fir&s;t Di&s;ea&s;e that works their Ruin, and is their greate&s;t Enemy during Life; but even before their Ap|pearance, the Di&s;ea&s;es they cau&s;e, we know by Experience, are con&s;iderable enough to take away Life.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Appearance of Teeth hap|pens commonly about &s;even Months af|ter our Birth, and is attended with divers Accidents. The Symptoms pre|ceding their Appearance is an Itching
<PB N="49" REF="50">of the Gums, follow'd by a <HI>Ptyali&s;mus,</HI> or Salivation of the Infant, ea&s;ily di&s;co|ver'd by the great Quantity of Saliva running from the Mouth. After this follows the Swelling of the Gums, ac|companied with great Pain.</P>
<P>If the Child has Strength to re&s;i&s;t, he will be attack'd with the <HI>Apthae,</HI> or little Ulcers, convex with a white Point: The&s;e Ulcers are often engender'd by the mo&s;t acrid and &s;erous Parts of the Blood, formed mo&s;t ea&s;ily on the Sur|face of the Membrane in the Mouth, being the mo&s;t &s;oft and tender. Some|times the parotid Glands &s;well and be|come con&s;iderable Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>When the Teeth, e&s;pecially the <HI>Ca|nini,</HI> are upon the Point of piercing the Gums, the Itching is then turn'd into great Pain, with Swelling of the Cheeks and Eyes, Catarrhs, Fever, Diarrhea, Nau&s;ea, Vomiting, In&s;om|nitude, Convul&s;ions, Lethargy, and too often the tragical Scene ends in Death.</P>
<P>The Thir&s;t occa&s;ioned by the Fever excites them to &s;uck more than their little Stomachs are able to bear; and from
<PB N="50" REF="51">hence follows that Indige&s;tion, and Cor|ruption, Vomiting, and Diarrhea, to which they are &s;o &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All the Symptoms happening to Chil|dren of the fir&s;t Age are produced by the Compre&s;&s;ion the Teeth make in divid|ing the Gums : And 'tis remarkable that the&s;e Di&s;orders &s;ometimes happen to Children of a more advanced Age, tho' very &s;eldom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inci&s;ores</HI> are more &s;harp, and pierce the Gums with le&s;s Pain than the <HI>Canini.</HI> The <HI>Molares,</HI> as they are large and flat upon their Extremities, are the Occa&s;ion of more Difficulty and Pain; but as they make their Appearance later than the others, the Child hath generally acquired greater Strength to re&s;i&s;t their Efforts.</P>
<P>The Di&s;ea&s;es I have mentioned, are indeed more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, as the Child is more or le&s;s vigorous. <HI>Hippo|crates</HI> tells us, that tho&s;e who cut their Teeth in the Winter, are le&s;s liable to the Danger of the Fever, than in a warmer Sea&s;on: that when they have a Diar|rhea, they are le&s;s &s;ubject to Convul&s;ions;
<PB N="51" REF="52">that the healthie&s;t-looking Children, and who &s;leep &s;ound, are in Danger of being &s;urprized with Convul&s;ions, of which Death is not always the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Progno&s;tics we may judge of the Effects re&s;ulting from a good or bad Con&s;titution of the Child, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I would advi&s;e Mothers on the&s;e Occa&s;ions to apply to a Man of Skill in the Profe&s;&s;ion, and be extremely cautions of engaging in an Affair where|in the lea&s;t Error may prove fatal.</P>
