<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the following E&s;|&s;ay is briefly and plainly to re|pre&s;ent the pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;ick in this Kingdom; and to demon&s;trate the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Regulation in the Pra|ctice of it. And as I'm fully per&s;wa|ded &s;uch a Regulation in Phy&s;ick would tend both to the Honour of the Nation in general, and the Good of her Maje|&s;ty's Subjects in particular; &s;o there &s;eems no need of making any manner of Apology for engaging in &s;o very laudable an Attempt. I can, for my own Part &s;incerely declare to tho&s;e who&s;e Chance
<PB REF="3">it may be to have this E&s;&s;ay fall into their Hands, that the De&s;ign of it is entirely hone&s;t, having a&s;&s;uredly no other View than that of doing Service to the aggrieved, which is the far greate&s;t Part of the Kingdom. No private Con&s;ideration of what Nature &s;oever could have mov'd me thus to expo&s;e my &s;elf to the Cen&s;ures of the World; e&s;|pecially in an Affair for the Inter|meddling with which, 'tis to be feared I may expect more Reproaches than Thanks. For tho' I have often had it in my Thoughts, that a Man could not do a better Piece of Service to the Pub|lick, than to demon&s;trate the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Regulation in Phy&s;ick; yet the Con&s;ideration of what a va&s;t Num|ber of Enemies he mu&s;t con&s;equently rai&s;e to him&s;elf, did for &s;ome time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, deter me from the At|tempt. I was very &s;en&s;ible, what a Multitude of People there are, who not only &s;ub&s;i&s;t but enrich them&s;elves
<PB REF="4">by tho&s;e very Methods which I had undertaken to condemn; and therefore very well knew, that right or wrong I &s;hould not fail to meet with a Legion of Opponents. But the Love of Truth, and a hearty De&s;ire of contributing &s;omewhat to the common Good of Man|kind, did at la&s;t outweigh and prevail with me above all other Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>If then the following E&s;&s;ay may but in &s;ome Mea&s;ure contribute to the Re|moval of tho&s;e pernicious Encroach|ments, which have been unhappily made upon the Province of Phy&s;ick, I &s;hall have gain'd my End, and &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e any little Cen&s;ures or Reflexions which thereby I may po&s;&s;ibly draw upon my &s;elf. And tho' I am not at pre&s;ent con&s;cious of any valid Objections which can be made again&s;t what I have advanc'd, yet do promi&s;e, whatever they be, if fairly and candidly propos'd, I'll en|deavour to an&s;wer them in the &s;ame
<PB REF="5">Manner. For to conclude, I have given the Title of an ESSAY to the following Sheets, becau&s;e I have only touch'd upon, and not exhau&s;ted the Subject.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY Concerning the <HI>Growth of Empirici&s;m,</HI> Or the Encouragement of <HI>Quacks.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HEALTH being the great|e&s;t of Natural Ble&s;&s;ings, 'tis as needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing in its Prai&s;e as to enlarge up|on the U&s;efulne&s;s of Phy&s;ick, which pre&s;erves and re&s;tores it. But as there is nothing which would more
<PB N="2" REF="9">advance the U&s;efulne&s;s of that Di|vine Art, (and is therefore of great|er Importance to the Publick Good) than a Regulation in the Practice of it; &s;o there is nothing con&s;e|quently more recommendable to the Con&s;ideration of the Queen and Parliament than the pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;ick in this Kingdom. The Encouragement which Quacks and Empiricks have lately met with, is not only &s;o &s;urprizingly great, but &s;o va&s;tly detrimental, that in the be&s;t of Governments, where Civil and Religious Properties are &s;o hap|pily &s;ecured, there &s;eems nothing more wanting than &s;ome &s;peedy and powerful Expedient to re&s;train &s;o growing an Evil.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to offer any of my Rea&s;ons for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Regulation in the Practice of Phy|&s;ick, or enter into a Detail of the evil Con&s;equences (de&s;ervedly to
<PB N="3" REF="10">be lamented by all who have a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of them) which attend the Encouragement of Quacks and Em|piricks, 'twill not be improper to give the definition of, or to let the Reader know what I de&s;ire may be under&s;tood by the Words. The Word <HI>Quack,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Gazophylacium An|glicanum,</HI> is of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Original, &s;ignifies a frivolous and vain Tat|ler, and &s;o is applicable to all Per|&s;ons of any Profe&s;&s;ion, who often|tatiou&s;ly pretend to a great deal of Skill and Knowledge in Matters which they are really ignorant of, or do very little under&s;tand: And by a Quack or Empirick, I mean any and every one of tho&s;e who pretend to practice Phy&s;ick without Knowledge of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to that mo&s;t u&s;eful but mo&s;t difficult Art. There are &s;ome, 'tis true, who would fain per&s;wade us, that the Medical Art is only to be pro|moted
<PB N="4" REF="11">by Experiments, or ob&s;er|ving what things are hurtful, what beneficial in Di&s;ea&s;es; that the Study of Nature and the Know|ledge of the Body are only trifling Curio&s;ities, and things altogether &s;uperfluous. But it's agreed, I am apt to think, among&s;t the more in|telligent part of Mankind, that there are &s;everal things perfectly and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known, before a Man can rea&s;on, and make Judgment either of the Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es, or the U&s;e of Methods and Medicines for the re|medying them, and therefore ought to be under&s;tood before he pre&s;umes to take the Care of Mens Lives in|to his hands: For how can he pre|tend to cure Di&s;ea&s;es, unle&s;s he fir&s;t apprehends what they are, and in what they con&s;i&s;t? How can he rationally pre&s;cribe Medicines if he under&s;tands not their Operations?
<PB N="5" REF="12">Or how can he expect any manner of Advantage from them if he does not con&s;ider the Relation between the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Operation? And how can he be qualified to do any of the&s;e things, unle&s;s he be fir&s;t acquainted with the Nature, Properties and Functions, of a hu|man Body, the Subject of his Art, and to which they relate? And that this was the Opinion of the ancient Phy&s;icians, is evident from the Variety of Medical Introducti|ons and In&s;titutions publi&s;h'd by them. For it was not in tho&s;e days thought proper that the Care of Mens Lives &s;hould be entru&s;ted with Per&s;ons, till they were in|&s;tructed in the Methods of pre&s;er|ving them.</P>

<P>But that there are &s;everal things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known by Men before they ought to pre|tend to the Practi&s;e of Phy&s;ick, and which are what I mean by the <HI>Prae|requi&s;ita</HI> to the Medical Art, will more fully appear by a particular Enumeration of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knowledge of</P>

<ITEM>III. The Animal Oeconomy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Pharmacology.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> then, which I &s;hall mention, is the Knowledge of the learned Langua|ges: For Phy&s;ick being the Wi&s;|dom which is heap'd up in the va|rious Labours and Ob&s;ervations of the Learned of all Ages, or the Judgments of many Men wound up,
<PB N="7" REF="14">as it were into one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum unius hominis vita ad omnium in|ventionem &s;ufficere nequeat, longi temporis ob&s;ervationes Hi&s;toria colligit, ut ejus benefi|cio tanquam ex multis tot &s;aeculorum homini|bus unus efficiatur eruditi&s;&s;imus. <HI>Galen. de &s;ub|figur. Empir.</HI> Cap. 9.</NOTE>, 'twill be found nece&s;&s;ary in a Phy&s;ician to be vers'd in the Writings of the An|cients as well as the Moderns, and to be well acquainted with their Rules, Cautions and Remedies, they having laid the fir&s;t Foundation of the mo&s;t excellent Art, by both ob&s;erving and de&s;cribing the Na|ture of Di&s;ea&s;es. Mo&s;t of the Di|agno&s;tick and Progno&s;tick Signs of Di&s;ea&s;es are the Re&s;ult of their la|borious and &s;olid Ob&s;ervations, and will continue to be faithful Guides to all that can make U&s;e of them, as long as human Bodies and Na|ture it &s;elf remain. Nothing there|fore can be more previou&s;ly ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="8" REF="15">to the Practice of Phy&s;ick than an Acqui&s;ition of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues; for as in tho&s;e Languages the Art is deliver'd; &s;o without them the Terms in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lations are not po&s;&s;ibly to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="2">II. The next of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> is Natural Philo&s;ophy: For as the Art of Phy&s;ick is only the Natural Knowledge apply'd to the Pre&s;er|vation of Health and Life; &s;o whoever intend to apply them&s;elves to that Art will find it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the Human Body, the Sub|ject of their Art, as a meer Natu|ral Sub&s;tance, before they proceed to the Con&s;ideration of it as an A|nimated Being. For tho' the Hu|man Body, as an Animated Be|ing, is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the im|mediate Subject of their Care; yet the peculiar Properties of A|nimated
<PB N="9" REF="16">Sub&s;tances cannot well be di&s;tingui&s;h'd or under&s;tood, un|le&s;s the common Affections of Mat|ter be fir&s;t known, out of which, the Human as well as other Ani|mated Bodies are compos'd. And notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e Particles of Matter, which are modify'd into a Human Body, during that State, are enrich'd with Properties and Perfections, di&s;tingui&s;hing them from all other Beings, yet there re|main in them &s;ome Affections com|mon to other animated Beings, and &s;ome promi&s;cuou&s;ly to be found in all Natural Sub&s;tances. Whoever, therefore de&s;igns to apply him&s;elf to the Art of Phy&s;ick, ought to com|prehend the general Properties and Affections of Matter; the Origin and tran&s;itory Nature of Forms and Qualities; and how the Parts of a Human Body con&s;ider'd as a Na|tural Sub&s;tance may be mov'd, be|fore
<PB N="10" REF="17">he begins to inform him&s;elf (or indeed rightly can) of the Af|fections ob&s;ervable in a human Bo|dy, as animated or endued with Life. And this &s;eems to have been the Method by which Novices were heretofore initiated into that Art, as appears by the In&s;titutes of <HI>Ga|len, Rha&s;es, Sennertus, Fuch&s;ius, &amp;c.</HI> as likewi&s;e in that they have blended and interwoven the Philo|&s;ophy e&s;teem'd in tho&s;e Ages with that mo&s;t excellent Art, and have form'd that proverbial Saying,</P>
<Q>Ubi definit Phy&s;icus, ibi incipit Me|dicus.</Q>
<P>But Natural Philo&s;ophy is not on|ly ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to form a right Apprehen&s;ion of the Human Body as a Part or Portion of Mat|ter, but al&s;o to frame a true Idea of Medicines and their Operations,
<PB N="11" REF="18">as will more fully appear under that Head.</P>
<P N="3">III. The next of the <HI>Praerequi&s;i|ta</HI> is the Knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy, or the Con&s;ideration of the human Body as animated or endued with Life, and that as well in its natural or healthful, as in its praeternatural or morbid State; it being altogether nece&s;&s;ary to un|der&s;tand the natural State of the Body before the Nature of a Di&s;|ea&s;e can be rightly comprehended. The Animal Body is now known to be a pure Machine, and its A|ctions and Motions demon&s;trated to be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of its Structure. And as the Actions of the Body, from which Life and Health do flow, are the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of its Oeconomy; &s;o likewi&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es and all their Symptoms, are nothing but Alte|rations
<PB N="12" REF="19">or Di&s;orders in it. It de|mon&s;tratively therefore follows, that the greater the Knowledge of the one is, the better the Nature of the other mu&s;t be known; and that a Phy&s;ician ignorant of the A|nimal Oeconomy is ignorant of the Structure and U&s;es of the Machine he undertakes to regulate. The Parts of Animated Bodies are aptly and u&s;efully divided into Solid and Fluid. Anatomy, or the Art of Di&s;&s;ecting the &s;olid Parts of Ani|mal Bodies, in order to an exact Di&s;covery of their Situation, Stru|cture, U&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy, &s;o it has ever been ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd one of the Foundation Pillars of Phy&s;ick. Nor indeed of le&s;s U&s;e is the Doctrine of the Fluids; under which Head I include a right Apprehen&s;ion of the general and particular Proper|ties
<PB N="13" REF="20">of the Animal Fluids, and of their different Motions, Nature, U&s;es, Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are &s;e|veral other things al&s;o included in the Knowledge of the Animal Oe|conomy (and &s;ome few of them I &s;hall ju&s;t mention) which tho' not &s;trictly referable to either Branch of the above-mention'd Divi&s;ion of the Parts, are yet equally nece&s;&s;a|ry to be under&s;tood; <HI>viz.</HI> the dif|ferent Dependencies the Parts have on, and the different Relations they bear to each other; the Powers of Motion (both Voluntary and In|voluntary) and Sen&s;ation; the ge|neral Rea&s;on and Nature of Secre|tion; the Velocity of the Blood's Circulation, with the Rea&s;on of its Differences at different Di&s;tances from the Heart; the Nece&s;&s;ity of Breathing after Birth, with the Force of the Air upon the Blood in that Action, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> But an
<PB N="14" REF="21">exact Knowledge of the Animal Structure and Oeconomy, will after|wards appear more particularly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as well to explicate the Vir|tues and Operation of Medicines, as to a&s;certain the Diagno&s;is, and comprehend the Aetiology of Di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Another of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> is Pharmacology; comprehending the Knowledge, 1. Of &s;imple Na|tural Medicines, whether of the Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Kingdom. 2. Of the &s;everal Parts of Pharmacy, both Galenical and Chymical. 3. Of the general Na|ture, Virtues, and Operation of Medicines. For as a Man cannot be &s;aid to under&s;tand an Art, with|out under&s;tanding the In&s;truments as well as the Subject of that Art; &s;o the Human Body being the Sub|ject, and Medicines the In&s;tru|ments
<PB N="15" REF="22">of this Art, the Knowledge of the one mu&s;t con&s;equently be as nece&s;&s;ary as the Knowledge of the other.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Knowledge of &s;imple Natural Medicines, I here mean that of the Substances them&s;elves as well as of their Medicinal Vir|tues and Efficacies. 'Twould be altogether needle&s;s to wa&s;t any Time in in&s;i&s;ting upon the Nece&s;&s;i|ty of under&s;tanding this part of Pharmacology: For as without knowing the Sub&s;tances, a Man in his Practice mu&s;t wholly confide in, or rely upon the Gatherers and Venders of Medicines; &s;o indeed the Knowledge of their Virtues and Efficacies, without knowing the Sub&s;tances them&s;elves, &s;eems to me, if of any, of a very dangerous U&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Pharmacy contains the Man|ner of Preparing and the Method of making &s;uch &s;imple Sub&s;tances into
<PB N="16" REF="23">Medicines, and con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal Parts, whether according to the Ga|lenical or Chymical Forms. All the &s;everal Parts of Pharmacy, and of Chymi&s;try in particular, <HI>viz.</HI> as it teaches the mo&s;t Compendious and Efficacious Preparation of Medi|cines, are, and have been &s;o often demon&s;trated to be &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood by all who de&s;ign for the Practice of Phy|&s;ick, that as there is nothing in which Men &s;eem more agreed than in the Nece&s;&s;ity of under&s;tanding the&s;e things; &s;o it would be but Lo&s;s of Time to enlarge any further upon them. I &s;hall therefore con|clude what I have to offer under this Head, with the following Ob&s;er|vation; That &s;ince it is &s;o nece&s;&s;a|rily incumbent upon every one who pretends to the Practice of Phy|&s;ick, to under&s;tand all the Parts of Pharmacy, there can be no Obje|ction
<PB N="17" REF="24">made upon that Account, I mean, again&s;t a Phy&s;ician's prepa|ring his own Medicines, but either by ignorant or intere&s;ted Men. But tho' this Ob&s;ervation is &s;uffici|ent to excu&s;e the Phy&s;icians for gi|ving their own Medicines (which indeed is only re&s;uming what their Ance&s;tors either out of Pride or La|zine&s;s left off) yet it does not fol|low that there is any manner of A|pology to be made for the Apothe|caries intruding them&s;elves into the Practice of Phy&s;ick, as will more fully afterwards appear.</P>
<P N="3">3. Under the third Branch of Pharmacology is compriz'd the Knowledge of the general Nature, Virtues and Operation of Medi|cines. And as Natural Philo&s;ophy was proved to be nece&s;&s;ary towards forming a right Notion of the Hu|man Body, &s;o 'twill be found as nece&s;&s;ary towards comprehending
<PB N="18" REF="25">the general Nature, Virtues and O|peration of Medicines. For Medi|cines being only natural Sub&s;tan|ces, only Parts or Portions of Mat|ter, 'tis evident, that their Powers and Properties are not only under the &s;ame common Laws and Rules which are ob&s;erved in the other Parts of Matter, but are al&s;o to be explain'd in the &s;ame Methods; and therefore Medicines are not only Natural Sub&s;tances, but they al&s;o operate in a Natural Way, [<HI>i. e.</HI> by different Kinds and Degrees of Mo|tion] &s;uch Natural Sub&s;tances loo|&s;ing only their Denomination, and not their Natures, by being term'd or applied as Medicines. By a due Apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e things, and without which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for a Practitioner in Phy&s;ick to be really u&s;eful or &s;erviceable in his Generation, Men will know what Effects to expect, and be prevent|ed
<PB N="19" REF="26">from a credulous Expectation of Effects, which can in no wi&s;e pro|ceed from them in a natural Way. Medicines, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> is made up of &s;o va&s;t a Variety of Natural Sub&s;tan|ces, may, in re&s;pect of their gene|ral Virtues or Operation, be com|priz'd under &s;uch as produce &s;ome Evacuation, or &s;uch as only effect &s;ome Alteration in the Body. And not only Natural Philo&s;ophy, but a due Knowledge al&s;o of the Animal Oeconomy is absolutely nece&s;&s;ary towards framing a right Notion of the&s;e Things: For unle&s;s Men un|der&s;tand the Structure, and com|prehend the U&s;es and Offices of the Parts of the Body, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to know how, or by what Organs, or in what Regions, Parts or Juices, Medicines perform their Operations.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="27">
<P N="5">V. The fifth and la&s;t of the <HI>Prae|requi&s;ita,</HI> which I &s;hall mention, is No&s;ology; containing whatever re|lates to the General Nature, Signs, Cau&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es. For as the Con&s;ideration of the Human Body, in its natural or healthful State, is, by Phy&s;icians, only in order to the Con&s;ideration of it in its Praeternatural or Morbid one; &s;o con&s;equently there can be no|thing more previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to the Practice of Phy&s;ick than what|ever relates to the Knowledge of the General Nature, Signs, Cau|&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t the Want of a clear Idea of the General Nature of Di&s;|ea&s;es mu&s;t be a certain Means of laying a nece&s;&s;ary and afterwards unalterable Foundation of Error and Mi&s;carriage in Practice. One would be tempted to think, from
<PB N="21" REF="28">the erroneous Proceedings of unin|telligent Practitioners, that Di&s;ea&s;es were really &s;eparate E&s;&s;ences, (or I know not what &s;ub&s;tantial Forms) and as &s;uch enter'd and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Bodies of Men. Whereas, by a due Con&s;ideration of their Na|tures, they will be found to be no|thing different or di&s;tinct from the Body, but only Changes or Altera|tions in the Modification of its con|&s;tituent Parts, or different Modes of Indi&s;po&s;ition in the &s;ame Body.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, the Doctrine of the Signs, both Diagno&s;tick and Prog|no&s;tick, is not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to be throughly under&s;tood, before a Man undertakes the Practice of Phy&s;ick, than the General Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es. For as by a due Know|ledge of the Diagno&s;tick Signs, he may be in&s;tructed truly to di&s;tin|gui&s;h one Di&s;ea&s;e, tho' never &s;o much alike, from another; &s;o
<PB N="22" REF="29">thro' want of that Knowledge, one Di&s;ea&s;e is very often mi&s;taken for and treated as another. How of|ten, for In&s;tance, has a <HI>Colica</HI> and a <HI>Nephritis,</HI> a <HI>Fluor Albus</HI> and a <HI>Go|norrhaea,</HI> a <HI>Chloro&s;is</HI> and a <HI>Phthi&s;is</HI> been confounded? So that the Foundation of Cure &s;eems prima|rily to be laid in a right Apprehen|&s;ion of the Diagno&s;tick Signs of each Di&s;temper. But here it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the better a Man under&s;tands the Animal Structure and Oeconomy, the more capable he will be both of comprehending and a&s;certaining the Diagno&s;is, and that a Man ignorant of tho&s;e things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily mi&s;lead him&s;elf by the U&s;e of a common Name, and apply it to denote Circum&s;tances which are &s;o far from being always alike, that they will be &s;ometimes found extremely different.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="30">
<P>And as to the Progno&s;tick Signs of Di&s;ea&s;es; tho' it be certain that the Recovery of the Sick is the great De&s;ign of the Medical Art, and undoubtedly more nece&s;&s;ary than Pre&s;aging the Event of Di|&s;tempers, yet the Advances which have been made in the Progno&s;tick Part of Medicine, as acquiring no &s;mall E&s;teem and Authority to the Phy&s;ician, ought diligently to be collected from the Ob&s;ervations of the Ancients, particularly of the Divine <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as well as from the Writings of the Moderns.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly, the Aetiology of Di&s;ea&s;es; I mean more particular|ly as to the immediate and conjunct Cau&s;es, will be found as nece&s;&s;ary to be known by every Practitioner, as either the General Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es, or the Doctrine of the Signs. For if, as is very evident in Practice, Di&s;ea&s;es even of the
<PB N="24" REF="31">&s;ame Denomination, ari&s;ing from different Cau&s;es, do admini&s;ter different Indications, or indicate different Methods of Cure; the Aetiology mu&s;t con&s;equently be a grand Source from whence Ratio|nal Indications can be drawn. 'Twere very ea&s;ie to give In&s;tances in almo&s;t all the Di&s;ea&s;es incident to the Human Body, but thinking it altogether needle&s;s, becau&s;e the Medical Writings are &s;o full of them, I &s;hall conclude this Head with ob|&s;erving, That as an exact Know|ledge of the Animal Structure and Oeconomy is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to comprehend the Aetiology of Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;o the Modern Improve|ments in Anatomy have very con&s;i|derably advanc'd the Aetiological Part of Medicine.</P>
<P>Having thus, with the utmo&s;t Brevity demon&s;trated, that there
<PB N="25" REF="32">are &s;everal things perfectly and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known by Men before they ought to pretend to the Practice of Phy|&s;ick; my pre&s;ent De&s;ign does not at all oblige me to enquire whether I have enumerated all the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to the Medical Art; but from that Enumeration of them which I have made, and from what I have advanc'd, under each of tho&s;e Heads, may very fairly venture to draw the following Con|clu&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That Experience alone will not make a Phy&s;ician.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That the Enumeration of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to the Medi|cal Art is a &s;ufficient Argu|ment with what Difficulty, a due Qualification for the Practice of it is attain'd.</ITEM>
<PB N="26" REF="33">
<ITEM>III. That it is a plain Demon|&s;tration, how unqualified the Quacks are for exerci&s;ing the Profe&s;&s;ion they pretend to.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. That it is an evident Indi|cation to the rational Part of Mankind, who do, and who do not, and that the far great|e&s;t Part of the Practioners in Phy&s;ick do come under the Denomination of Quacks.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. That an Apothecary can no more be &s;aid to be Qualified for the Practice of Phy&s;ick, than any other Mechanical Trade&s;man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. That Experience alone will not make a Phy&s;ician: For if there are, as I have already proved, &s;e|veral things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known by Men, before they can judge of the Nature of Di&s;ea|&s;es or Remedies, which are what I
<PB N="27" REF="34">mean by the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to the Medical Art: It evidently follows that Experience alone, <HI>i. e.</HI> Expe|rience without the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> will not make a Phy&s;ician. The Art of Phy&s;ick then may very aptly and u&s;e|fully be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t two Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> The Theoretical and Practical. And as there is nothing truer on the one hand, than that the Theory, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knowledge of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> is, as has been fully prov'd, ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Practice: &s;o there is nothing more evident on the other, than that the Know|ledge of the Theory, tho' previ|ou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, is only in order to, and therefore u&s;ele&s;s without, the Practice. For tho' 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble (I affirm) a Man &s;hould make any con&s;iderable Figure in the Pra|ctice, who is ignorant of the praeli|minary Arts which compo&s;e the Theory of Phy&s;ick: And if with|out
<PB N="28" REF="35">the Knowledge of tho&s;e Arts, a Man jumps, as I may &s;ay, into Practice, &s;uch a one is never to be tru&s;ted, tho' he had &s;een Thou&s;ands of Patients, and ten thou&s;and Pre|&s;criptions; yet do I not (as it is ri|diculous to) &s;uppo&s;e, that Men &s;hould re&s;t here, or dwell upon the Theory; or that the &s;peculative Part of Phy&s;ick &s;hould teach them to cure all manner of Di&s;tempers in their Clo&s;ets, without a con&s;tant Attendance on the Sick, without a diligent and unwearied Ob&s;erva|tion on Di&s;ea&s;es. A due Appre|hen&s;ion of the&s;e things may be a Means to determine the many un|nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;putes concerning the Preference of one Part of Phy&s;ick to the other; the Knowledge of the one ab&s;olutely depending on, and con&s;equently being altogether as nece&s;&s;ary as that of the other. And as Theory and Practice, &s;o
<PB N="29" REF="36">Rea&s;on and Ob&s;ervation ought not to be compar'd with, or oppos'd to, each other, but join'd together, as mutually adorning and illu&s;tra|ting one another to the fully com|pleating of a Phy&s;ician. A Man may be an Advocate for Experience, and well appriz'd of the U&s;efulne&s;s of accurate Ob&s;ervations, and at the &s;ame time not di&s;card the U&s;e of Rea&s;on in Phy&s;ick. True Ob|&s;ervations will never be found to contradict Right Rea&s;on, nor will Right Rea&s;on exert it &s;elf in, oppo|&s;ition to matter of Fact. But le&s;t any of the Empirical Tribe &s;hould pretend to take Shelter under Au|thorities, or to interpret what <HI>Ba|glivi</HI> &s;ays concerning Experience and Ob&s;ervation in favour of them&s;elves, I've purpo&s;ely read over all the Works of that celebrated Author, and from innumerable Pa&s;&s;ages in his Writings, think nothing more
<PB N="30" REF="37">evident, than that it is a Literate, and not an Empirical Experience, which he contends for. 'Tis not Experience without the <HI>Praerequi&s;i|ta,</HI> but &s;uch a well grounded Ex|perience as a Man duly qualify'd for the Practice of Phy&s;ick, may daily with Rea&s;on, be &s;uppos'd to acquire. And 'tis as evident, that what he has advanc'd, concerning the Importance of Ob&s;ervation in the Way of Phy&s;ick, ought to be interpreted in that very Sen&s;e. For tho' he &s;ays, That nothing &s;o na|turally tends to the Improvement of Phy&s;ick, as Experiments and Ob&s;ervations, yet 'tis certainly true, that he de&s;ires it might be under|&s;tood (as indeed it ought to be) of Experiments directed by the Know|ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, and of Ob&s;ervations grounded on that and the other <HI>Praerequi&s;ita.</HI> So notwith&s;tanding what Dr. <HI>Syden|ham</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="38">declares, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Epi&s;t. Ded. Ob&s;.

De Podagra.</HI> p. <HI>80.</HI> Edit. Lugd. Bat.</NOTE> <HI>Praxin e&s;&s;e Medicinae Profitentium Lapidem Lydium,</HI> 'tis evident from Pa&s;&s;ages enough in that worthy Author, particularly from the whole 81&s;t Page of the la&s;t mention'd Treati&s;e, that he never de&s;ign'd, by what he &s;ays, to advance an Empirical Ex|perience, or to preclude the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of under&s;tanding the <HI>Prae|requi&s;ita.</HI> As there is nothing more ridiculous than to &s;uppo&s;e all Men capable of making a good U&s;e of Experience, or able to draw right Conclu&s;ions from the Motions of Nature; &s;o Quacks and Empi|ricks, who &s;et out without either
<PB N="32" REF="39">Light or Method mu&s;t undoubt|edly prove &s;tupid and erroneous Ob&s;ervators: It being indeed im|po&s;&s;ible that Men ignorant of the Medical <HI>Praerequi&s;ita,</HI> &s;hould be capable of improving either them|&s;elves or the Art by their Experi|ence and Ob&s;ervations. What there|fore is daily &s;aid in prai&s;e of Expe|rience (to which no one pays a greater Deference than my &s;elf) and in Recommendation of expe|rienc'd Phy&s;icians, ought to be un|der&s;tood with &s;uch a Re&s;triction as not to include the Practitioners, who never had Opportunities of Under&s;tanding the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita.</HI> How ridiculous then is the Folly of tho&s;e People who magnifie an Empirical Experience, or cry up a Quack of what&s;oever Figure or Fame, for a Man of Experience, which wanting a Foundation, can|not be of any real U&s;e and Ser|vice
<PB N="33" REF="40">either to him&s;elf or others.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the Enumeration of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to the Medical Art, is a &s;ufficient Argument with what Difficulty a due Qualification for The Practice of it is attain'd. For if it be &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as has been already prov'd, to under|&s;tand the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to that Art, 'tis very ea&s;ie to infer, both what Length of Time and Labour of Thought the Acqui&s;ition of &s;o much Knowledge will require. 'Tis not then a Raw and Superficial Knowledge of Receipts and Medi|cines of Di&s;ea&s;es and their Cures, which will qualifie a Man for the Practice of Phy&s;ick, but a gradual Advancement thro' all the above|mention'd Foundations of the Art. 'Tis not to be &s;uppos'd, that the <HI>Ars longi&s;&s;ima</HI> &s;hould be &s;o quickly acquir'd, or the mo&s;t difficult of
<PB N="34" REF="41">Sciences &s;o in&s;tantly attain'd. And this Truth is not only confirm'd by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> in his very fir&s;t Aphori&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>, and in his Enume|ration of the Nece&s;&s;aries which he requires to con&s;titute a Good Phy&s;ician<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Hippoer. Lex.</NOTE>; but by the con|current Te&s;timonies, both of the Ancients and the Moderns. Yet notwith&s;tanding what has been ad|vanced, concerning the <HI>Praerequi&s;i|ta</HI> to the Medical Art, and the Difficulty of acquiring the Know|ledge of them; it is very &s;urpri|zing to con&s;ider what a va&s;t Num|ber of Per&s;ons there are, what would fain become Phy&s;icians without La|bour and Study, and be &s;aluted Sons of <HI>Apollo,</HI> without any man|ner
<PB N="35" REF="42">of Right to the Title. But all and every one of tho&s;e who are ignorant of the Preliminary Arts, which compo&s;e the Theory, are but Pretenders in Phy&s;ick, do jump, as I &s;aid, into Practice, and are ne|ver to be tru&s;ted tho' they had &s;een thou&s;ands of Patients, and ten thou|&s;and Pre&s;criptions. But I now pro|ceed, in the third Place, more par|ticularly to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">III. That the Enumeration of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to the Medical Art, is a plain Demon&s;tration how unqualified the Quacks are for ex|erci&s;ing the Profe&s;&s;ion they pretend to. And if, as has been prov'd, there are &s;o many things ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to be known, before a Man can either rea&s;on or judge of Di&s;ea&s;es; it evidently follows, that a Quack, ignorant of tho&s;e things, is ab&s;olutely unqualified for that
<PB N="36" REF="43">Profe&s;&s;ion. Were but the Matter indeed, as impartially con&s;ider'd as it ought to be, there &s;eems no|thing more ridiculous than to pretend to the Practice of Phy|&s;ick, without a previous Know|ledge of them; it being im|po&s;&s;ible but &s;uch People mu&s;t make either Improper, Dangerous and De&s;tructive, or In&s;ignificant and U&s;ele&s;s Applications. It is not on|ly true in Fact, that the mo&s;t ge|nerous often prove the mo&s;t dead|ly Medicines, if admini&s;tred with|out Judgment; but it is an every day's Ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e very things which have the Reputation of being harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive, if improperly applied, do too often create very great Mi&s;chiefs. In the Practice of Phy&s;ick there is requir'd not only great Labour of Thought, in &s;earching into the &s;everal Ap|pearances and Circum&s;tances of
<PB N="37" REF="44">Di&s;ea&s;es, but al&s;o great Strength of Judgment in duly weighing and comparing them together. And it is not here, as in many other Ca&s;es, where Experiments may be repeated without any great Injury; for this perhaps admits but of one &s;ingle Tryal, which po&s;&s;ibly may terminate in the Death of a Man, and one fal&s;e Step, e&s;pecially in an acute Di&s;ea&s;e, may be of the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equence. Phy&s;ick, 'tis true, abounds with a very large Number of excellent Medicines: But Medicines, being Relations to Human Bodies, can only be &s;aid to be good or bad, as applied; and like all other In&s;truments to do ei|ther Good or Hurt, according to the Nature of the Hand which u|&s;es them. As there is nothing more con&s;picuous on the one hand, than the u&s;eful Effects of Medi|cines, when Methodically and Ju|diciou&s;ly
<PB N="38" REF="45">diciou&s;ly admini&s;tred: So there is nothing more obvious on the other, than the deadly Effects even of tho&s;e of the very fir&s;t Rank, when us'd, without either Method or Judgment. Can any thing then more fully demon&s;trate the Vanity of Empirici&s;m than the daily Ex|perience how Inefficacious and U&s;e|le&s;s, even the mo&s;t celebrated Spe|cificks are without a Judicious and Methodical Application? For tho' a more Noble Specifick than the <HI>Cortex,</HI> for In&s;tance, was never known, yet Experience convinces us how frequently we are forced even in intermitting Fevers, to call in to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Know|ledge of the Animal Oeconomy; and by Vomiting, Purging, or o|ther proper Means, to render that Specifick u&s;eful, which would o|therwi&s;e have been of no Effect: So that nothing &s;eems more ridiculous
<PB N="39" REF="46">than for a Man to pretend to cure Di&s;ea&s;es, tho' arm'd with the be&s;t of Medicines, without the Know|ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, and the No&s;ological <HI>Praerequi&s;ita.</HI> It may as well be expected that a blind Man &s;hould &s;hoot flying, or a deaf one tune an Organ.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore conclude this Head without ob&s;erving (which indeed naturally flows from the foregoing Con&s;iderations) how un|accountably infatuated they are, who apply them&s;elves to any of the Empirical Tribe; there being no|thing &s;o mon&s;trous as their Preten|ces; nothing, but the no le&s;s mon|&s;trous Credulity of tho&s;e who em|ploy them. But,</P>
<Q>Quos perdere vult Jupiter, prius dementat.</Q>
<P>Does any one Man more de&s;erve
<PB N="40" REF="47">to be ridicul'd, than he, who thinks his Gold Watch of too great Value to be put into the Hands of an un|der Workman, and at the &s;ame time, tru&s;ts his Body, a Machine of infinitely more curious Structure, with an ignorant Pretender in Phy|&s;ick. Can a Man put a greater Affront upon his Rea&s;on? Or can he give an odder Demon&s;tration of his Kindne&s;s to Wife, Children or Friends, than to commit any of them to the Care of &s;uch unequal Managers? In Matters of far le&s;s Moment, Men generally are more guided by the Dictates of Rea&s;on, and not &s;o ea&s;ily impos'd upon by any kind of empty Preten&s;ions. If the Title of an E&s;tate, wherein they are concern'd, be never &s;o lit|tle &s;u&s;pected, they immediately ap|ply to the Be&s;t Advice, and will &s;pare neither Co&s;t nor Pains for a Right Information; but which is
<PB N="41" REF="48">the mo&s;t unaccountable Piece of Folly imaginable, are extremely le&s;s &s;ollicitous about the Care of their Bodies than their E&s;tates.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the Enumeration of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> to the Medical Art, is an evident Indication to the Ra|tional Part of Mankind, who do, and who do not, and that the far greate&s;t Part of the Practitioners in Phy&s;ick do come under the De|nomination of Quacks: I appeal to the Rational Part of Mankind, becau&s;e they are the fitte&s;t Judges in the Matter; for as they are ca|pable of di&s;tingui&s;hing who have, and who have not, had Opportuni|ties of under&s;tanding the <HI>Praerequi|&s;ita;</HI> &s;o they cannot but at the &s;ame time be convinc'd, that the far greate&s;t Part of the Practitioners in Phy&s;ick, come under the Deno|mination of Quacks. There is no|thing
<PB N="42" REF="49">more Evident than that there are Pretenders in Phy&s;ick, who are &s;o far from having any Knowledge of the learned Languages, that they cannot write their own; are &s;o far from having made any Search|es into the va&s;t Collection of An|cient Learning, that they never perus'd even the Ob&s;ervations of the Moderns; are &s;o far from un|der&s;tanding Natural Philo&s;ophy or the Animal Oeconomy, that they never had Opportunities of learn|ing Anatomy or Chymi&s;try; ne|ver &s;aw a Di&s;&s;ection, or one Pro|ce&s;s of the Preparation of Medi|cines. What a melancholy Re|flection then is it, that &s;uch a Trade of deceiving &s;hould be carried on under the Pretences to &s;o u&s;eful an Art; and to con&s;ider, what a Num|ber of People there are who ha|ving no other Foundation but Im|pudence and Ignorance, bubble &s;o
<PB N="43" REF="50">many Thou&s;ands out of their Mo|ney and Lives?</P>
<P N="5">V. That an Apothecary can no more be &s;aid to be Qualified for the Practice of Phy&s;ick than any other Mechanical Trade&s;man. Tho' the Preparation of Medicines, ac|cording to the Pre&s;cript is properly &s;peaking the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Apothe|cary, and which Preparation re|quires only the Knowledge of the Sub&s;tances them&s;elves, and not of their Medicinal Virtues and Effi|cacies; yet let us &s;uppo&s;e an Apo|thecary endued with that Know|ledge al&s;o, and let us con&s;ider how far it will qualify him for the Pra|ctice of Phy&s;ick. We will then &s;uppo&s;e him to know that this Me|dicine will purge; this, vomit; and this produce other Evacuations, or perhaps only Alterations in the Bo|dy. But as to know what is Indi|cated
<PB N="44" REF="51">is one thing, and how to an|&s;wer &s;uch an Indication another; &s;o the Knowledge of the Virtues and Efficacies of Medicines will not at all in&s;truct or direct him in the Application of them. For Me|dicines being Relations to Human Bodies, can be only good or bad, as ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly applied: And therefore, as I in&s;tanc'd, tho' we &s;uppo&s;e a Man to know that &s;uch a Medicine will undoubtedly Purge, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;ollicit the Bowels into that Motion we call &s;o; yet whether this will be to the Advantage of the Per&s;on to whom it is given, de|pends not on the Man's Know|ledge of the Medicine's Operation, but on the Fitne&s;s and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Patients Body to receive it. Again, a Man may know, that there are &s;ome Preparations of An|timony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which will always pro|duce Vomiting. But tho' by the
<PB N="45" REF="52">Exhibition of a Vomit, a Vitiated Stomach is &s;ometimes re&s;tor'd; yet when the Stomach is deprav'd from a Cau&s;e which cannot be removed by Vomiting, 'tis plain, that the U&s;e of &s;uch Medicines cannot po&s;|&s;ibly effect its Recovery. And a great many more In&s;tances might be given in re&s;pect to the Opera|tion of Medicines, which only pro|duce &s;ome Alteration in the Body. The Excellency then of the Medi|cal Art con&s;i&s;ts in a right Appre|hen&s;ion of the Relation between the Powers of the Medicine, and the Circum&s;tances of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Now &s;uch a right Apprehen&s;ion of this Relation, as is &s;ufficient to qualify a Man for the Practice of Phy&s;ick, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be acquird by the Knowledge of Medicines, their Preparation and Virtues; but of all the abovemention'd <HI>Praere|qui&s;ita</HI> to the Art. And this &s;ingle
<PB N="46" REF="53">Con&s;ideration of the Relation be|tween the Medicine and the Body, as it di&s;tingui&s;hes a Regular from an Empirical Practice; &s;o it &s;uffi|ciently expo&s;es the Vanity of con|fiding in Receipts or <HI>No&s;trums,</HI> and plainly demon&s;trates that the mo&s;t celebrated Preparations (even of the Philo&s;ophers by Fire) are not capable of curing Di&s;ea&s;es, without a Judicious and Methodi|cal Application, and that there can be nothing con&s;equently more ridiculous than to &s;uppo&s;e an Apo|thecary capable of advi&s;ing from &s;eeing the Pre&s;cripts of Phy&s;ici|ans. If then the Knowledge of the Preparation of Medicines, if the Knowledge of their Virtues, and Efficacies, nay, if &s;eeing the very Pre&s;cripts of Phy&s;icians, will not amount to a Qualifica|tion; it demon&s;tratively follows that an Apothecary can no more
<PB N="47" REF="54">be &s;aid to be Qualified far the Pra|ctice of Phy&s;ick, having no other Means or Opportunities of acqui|ring The re&s;t of the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita,</HI> than any other Mechanical Trade&s;-man. That &s;mall Pittance of Learning which is acquird at School, if not afterwards lo&s;t in the &s;ervile Offi|ces of the Shop, can claim no man|ner of Con&s;ideration: No; the Prolix and Laborious Study of Phy|&s;ick, ought a&s;&s;uredly to commence upon a more Literate Foundation; and the Knowledge of it is not po&s;|&s;ibly attainable, but by an Educa|tion of a quite different Nature.</P>
<P>Twill be very pertinent to my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, and not unaccepta|ble to my Reader, I hope, to ac|quaint him, how the Apothecaries fir&s;t crept into Hou&s;es, and intro|duc'd them&s;elves into the Practice of Phy&s;ick. Their officious Vi&s;its were at fir&s;t made under Pretence
<PB N="48" REF="55">of carrying the Phy&s;ick them&s;elves, which indeed might procure them the Reputation of careful Men, tho by running on the Errands tis plain they chang'd Offices, with their Servants, and left them at home to do the Duty of their Ma|&s;ters. This gave them Opportu|nities of in&s;inuating them&s;elves in|to Nur&s;es, Servants, and, other weak Per&s;ons attending the Sick; and by their Means of being ad|mitted to give their Opinions; and thence under Pretence of good Husbandry for the Patient, to re|peat the Phy&s;icians Bills, without his Order; and at la&s;t to pre&s;cribe without his Advice. Yet I am not, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, for wholly laying a&s;ide this Order of Men, they being, in my Opinion very u&s;eful and &s;erviceable in their pro|per Station and Bu&s;ine&s;s, which is the Preparation of Medicines ac|cording
<PB N="49" REF="56">to the Pre&s;cript of the Phy|&s;ician. But when an Apothecary de&s;erts his Station in the Shop, neglects the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Trade, and runs about advi&s;ing in all Di|&s;tempers; he becomes an Empi|rick, and invades a Profe&s;&s;ion which he cannot be &s;uppos'd to under|&s;tand. Can any thing be more a|&s;toni&s;hing than the levelling of a Learned Liberal Science, with a Mechanick Trade of the Hand di|rected by that Science? I could wi&s;h the Fool's Character had been pre&s;erved in our Chronicles, or that his Features were now to be &s;een in his Statue of Bra&s;s, who fir&s;t &s;ent for the Handy-craft La|bourer of the Medicines to an&s;wer any Que&s;tions concerning the Na|ture of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>There is certainly no more Re|lation between the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Apothecary, and that of a Phy&s;i|cian,
<PB N="50" REF="57">than between the Grinding of Colours and the Art of Painting: And therefore an Apothecary, who, without Knowledge of the <HI>Praere|qui&s;ita,</HI> pretends to the Practice of Phy&s;ick, is altogether as ridicu|lous as a Colour-grinder, who, without any Skill in Drawing, &s;hould pre&s;ume to manage a Pen|cil The one may hear the Pa|tients examin'd, make up the Me|dicines him&s;elf, and ob&s;erve their Effects; the other may &s;ee the fir&s;t Stroaks chalk'd out, prepare the Colours him&s;elf, and afterwards &s;ee his Ma&s;ter at Work; yet nei|ther of them, without being fir&s;t in&s;tructed in the various Rules as well as fir&s;t Rudiments of the re|&s;pective Arts, &s;hall enter into the Skill of either the Phy&s;ician or Painter, tho' they look'd on them till Dooms-day. What Pity 'tis the Imitations of both cannot be e|qually
<PB N="51" REF="58">expos'd to view, that the unskilful Management of the one might be as con&s;picuous as would be the ridiculous dawbing of the other.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Body of Men, I mean the Surgeons, who notoriou&s;ly enough (tho' not in|deed &s;o frequently in great Towns as the Apothecaries) invade the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick. But as the Rules above-mention'd are &s;uffici|ent to di&s;tingui&s;h an Empirical Pre|tender from a Qualified Practitio|ner; &s;o by the Application of tho&s;e Rules to the Surgeons, 'tis very ea|&s;ily demon&s;trable, that they cannot but come under the Denomination of Quacks in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>Tho from what has been alrea|dy advanc'd, both concerning the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> and the Conclu&s;ions which have been drawn from the Enumeration of them, it may &s;eem
<PB N="52" REF="59">altogether needle&s;s; yet I &s;hall now proceed to offer three or four Rea|&s;ons more, which will further de|mon&s;trate the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Re|gulation in Phy&s;ick: And tho&s;e may be &s;aid to regard,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Good of the Publick in General.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Univer&s;ities in Parti|cular.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The Art of Phy&s;ick it &s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Regular Profe&s;&s;ors of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t Rea&s;on then for the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Regulation (concerns the Good of the Publick and) is the Lo&s;s of her Maje&s;ties Subjects. And if I affirm that the Encouragement of Quacks tends as much to the di&s;peopling of the Kingdom as the Wars; The Com|putation mu&s;t be allow'd to be mo|de&s;t,
<PB N="53" REF="60">provided they, kill as many in other Parts of the Kingdom as they do in tho&s;e within the Sphere of my own Ob&s;ervation. But the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion will more evidently appear to any one who does but fairly con&s;ider the Num|ber of Quacks with which every Corner of this Kingdom has the Misfortune to abound. For what but the mo&s;t di&s;mal Execution up|on the Lives, or the mo&s;t dreadful De&s;truction of Mankind, can be ex|pected from &s;uch a Prodigious Number of Men, who under|&s;tanding not what they profe&s;s; may truly be &s;aid to be Qualified, as they are Licenc'd, to kill. And tho' the mo&s;t horrid Slaughters are daily committed without any Fear of Puni&s;hment or Reproof; yet 'tis not a more melancholy Reflection to con&s;ider what a va&s;t Number of Men fall by the Hands of the&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="61">Executioners, than that the Execu|tioners them&s;elves &s;hould e&s;cape the Hands of Publick Ju&s;tice. I am not able to expre&s;s my Indig|nation again&s;t &s;uch pre&s;umptuous Homicides: They ought to be ex|tirpated, if not at once, yet by Degrees, as the Wolves out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But to return; I hope to be ex|cus'd (for who&s;oever is well appriz'd of her Powers may be pardon'd) for a&s;&s;erting, That it is better tru&s;ting to Nature than to an ignorant Pre|tender in Phy&s;ick. That Phy&s;icians are only Servants to Nature, and that &s;he is <HI>Morborum Medicatrix,</HI> are Truths known to the Ancients, and confirmd by the irrefragable Experience of the Moderns. And as Nature alone will conquer &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es, and judiciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the greate&s;t part; &s;o nothing is a brighter Demon&s;tration of the
<PB N="55" REF="62">Greatne&s;s of her Strength, than that even the Mi&s;management of Nur|&s;es, Apothecaries and other Quacks, is not able to hinder the Recovery of very large Numbers, which fall under their Hands. The greate&s;t part of the Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es are the Efforts of Nature, but which Efforts being ea&s;ily di&s;turb'd, or &s;oon oppos'd, require the mo&s;t &s;trict and wary Ob&s;ervance, and without Judgment, we may &s;ooner injure than a&s;&s;i&s;t her; &s;ooner op|pre&s;s than relieve her. A Phy&s;ici|an ought therefore religiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve and obey the Motions of Nature, to look upon them as his &s;ure&s;t Guides in the Cure of any Di&s;temper, and to be advis'd, ac|cording to them, what to do, and when, and in what manner to pro|ceed. The Art of Phy&s;ick is not under&s;tood till the Arti&s;t compre|hends, in the Words of my Lord
<PB N="56" REF="63"><HI>Bacon, Quid Natura ferat, &amp; faciat.</HI> But if the Calamities of the Sick are encreas'd by the very Means which are u&s;ed for their Relief; if in&s;tead of carefully a&s;&s;i&s;ting Na|ture in her Progre&s;&s;es to the Pre|&s;ervation of Life, &s;he be clogg'd with u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, or oppre&s;s'd with dangerous and de|&s;tructive Applications: I may ju&s;t|ly conclude the Condition of tho&s;e People who have the Misfortune to fall under &s;uch Hands, to be indeed a very deplorable one; and the Lo&s;s of her Maje&s;ties Subjects, from the fatal Mi&s;management of &s;o va&s;t a Number of Quacks, to be con|&s;equently &s;o very great, that the Encouragement of them may truly be &s;aid to tend as much to the di&s;peopling of the Kingdom as the Wars.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="64">
<P N="2">II. Another Argument for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Regulation in Phy|&s;ick, is, that the Encouragement of Empirici&s;m has already been a very great, and will hereafter be a far greater Detriment to the Uni|ver&s;ities: For it can never be &s;up|pos'd, that Men will be at the Ex|pence of &s;ending their Sons to any of the Seminaries of Good Litera|ture and ingenuous Education, when the Honours and Employ|ments of a Faculty may be obtain'd without it, and there is &s;o little Di&s;tinction made between a Regu|lar and an <HI>extempore</HI> Doctor. The Apothecaries, and other Quacks, now openly avow their Re&s;olutions of &s;eizing on the Practice of Phy|&s;ick; and of excluding in time all the Univer&s;ity Phy&s;icians. They give not only Examples, but al&s;o A&s;&s;urances of Succe&s;s to all the In|truders
<PB N="58" REF="65">into Divinity, and others, of the pretended Education in the Liberal Sciences. It would indeed be no great Matter of Wonder or Complaint, were Empiricks encou|raged only by the Ordinary Sort of People; or as the <HI>French</HI> call them, the <HI>Petits Gens;</HI> there being, as I have often ob&s;erv'd, a Sort of Sym|pathy between Under&s;tandings. But 'tis very unaccountably &s;urpri|zing, and a ju&s;t Matter of Com|plaint, that any of the di&s;tingui&s;h'd Part of Mankind &s;hould venture e|ven in dangerous Ca&s;es to employ &s;uch illiterate, and con&s;equently ignorant Pretenders. And what &s;till enhances my Amazement is, that any of tho&s;e Gentlemen, and e&s;pecially any of the Clergy, who have had the Happine&s;s of an Uni|ver&s;ity Education; &s;hould give any manner of Encouragement to this &s;ort of People. They have all laid
<PB N="59" REF="66">them&s;elves under the highe&s;t Ob|ligations of Pre&s;erving the Honour and Dignity of tho&s;e Fountains of Learning. And the Phy&s;icians of the Soul in particular being obliged to vi&s;it their Pari&s;hioners in Sick|ne&s;s, ought not only to inform them that it is their Duty, but to pre&s;s them al&s;o to apply to the Phy&s;icians of the Body, whom the Divine Laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;t. 38. 1-12.</NOTE> as well as our own have appointed; in&s;tead of either making u&s;e of Empiricks them|&s;elves, or advi&s;ing others to make u&s;e of them. I can never &s;ufficient|ly deplore the&s;e Indignities offer'd to our Univer&s;ities, nor ever e|nough blame and condemn the A|bettors and Promoters of them; but am not without Hopes that &s;uch growing Mi&s;chiefs as the&s;e are,
<PB N="60" REF="67">will &s;ometime be thought worthy the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e in whom alone is lodg'd the Power of Re|dre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P N="3">III. Another Argument for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Regulation in Phy|&s;ick, regards the Art it &s;elf; the Encouragement of Quacks and Em|piricks threatning the Ruin of the Profe&s;&s;ion as well as of the People. 'Twould be no very difficult Task to demon&s;trate the Certainty of the Medical Principles, and con&s;equent|ly the real U&s;efulne&s;s of Phy&s;ick to Mankind. But &s;uch an Attempt does not at all &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary in my pre&s;ent De&s;ign; becau&s;e 'tis not to be &s;uppos'd, that Per&s;ons &s;hould apply them&s;elves even to the mo&s;t ignorant Pretenders in Phy&s;ick, un|le&s;s &s;uch Per&s;ons really thought they &s;hould receive &s;ome Benefit from the Directions of tho&s;e to whom they
<PB N="61" REF="68">did apply. Yet notwith&s;tanding Phy&s;ick is undoubtedly e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon &s;uch Principles as do wholly free it from tho&s;e Reproaches of Uncertainty which it has often, tho' fal&s;ly, been charg'd with; it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be con|fe&s;s'd, that the Malignity of &s;ome Acute, and the Stubbornne&s;s of &s;ome Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es, do often elude all the A&s;&s;i&s;tances of Human Art: For the mo&s;t judicious and the mo&s;t experienc'd Phy&s;icians can have no Power, as the Wi&s;e Man expre&s;&s;es it, in the Day of Death. But this can be no manner of Ob|jection to the Certainty of the Me|dical Principles, becau&s;e it may happen and not proceed from any Defect in the Rules of the Art it &s;elf. For from a due Con&s;idera|tion of the Materials which com|po&s;e a human Body, the Elegancy of its Structure, and the continued
<PB N="62" REF="69">Flux of its Parts, 'tis very evident that it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be obnoxi|ous to Di&s;orders, which are Di&s;ea|&s;es; and &s;ooner or later as nece&s;&s;a|rily to a Di&s;&s;olution, which is Death. So that whoever is well appriz'd of the wonderful Fabrick of the Hu|man Body, how curiou&s;ly contriv'd and divinely fa&s;hion'd a Machine it is, may con&s;equently be rather amaz'd at our living &s;o long, than at our dying &s;o &s;oon. But tho' it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that it is not in the Phy&s;ician's Power at all times, or in all Extremities, to retrieve or pre&s;erve his Patients from the Jaws of Death, (&s;ince to die is an Entail upon our Natures) yet it may with Mode&s;ty be affirm'd, Experience abundantly proving it, that there is &s;o much Power in Medicines, and &s;o much Virtue in Methods, as to enable him, if he but heedfully weighs and judiciou&s;ly applies them,
<PB N="63" REF="70">to give Ea&s;e to &s;uch as are in Pain, Sleep to &s;uch as are wearied out with Watching, and Strength to with&s;tand the Approaches of grim and dreaded Death. But a Phy|&s;ician cannot, I &s;ay, be &s;uppos'd capable of doing the&s;e things with|out a due Con&s;ideration of Circum|&s;tances, and a Judicious Applica|tion of Medicines. For if Medi|cines are promi&s;cuou&s;ly us'd in all Con&s;titutions, or without Regard to the Circum&s;tances of each Ca&s;e, 'tis no Wonder they &s;o often de|ceive Men in their Expectations of Succe&s;s. And therefore as the Knowledge pf the <HI>Praerequi&s;ita</HI> is the only Means of Qualifying a Man for a &s;ucce&s;sful Practice in Phy&s;ick, and con&s;equently of ad|vancing the Credit and Reputation of the Art; &s;o the Ignorance of Quacks, both of the Nature, Cau|&s;es, and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="71">nece&s;&s;arily produce &s;o many and &s;o gro&s;s Mi&s;managements as can|not but extremely prejudice Man|kind in their Opinion of the Art. Their ill Succe&s;&s;es are doubtle&s;s imputed to the Uncertainty of the Art it &s;elf, e&s;pecially by the Un|di&s;tingui&s;hing, which is much the larger Part of Mankind; and Men from their le&s;&s;en'd Opinion of it, will by Degrees neglect to apply to any Advice at all; whereas the truly Noble and Divine Art it &s;elf ought by no Means to be charg'd with what is only to be imputed to the Ignorance of tho&s;e who pre|tend to profe&s;s it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, 'tis a true and general Ob&s;ervation, that Arts and Sciences do improve and grow u&s;eful, accor|ding to the Encouragement of tho&s;e who profe&s;s them. But the fre|quent Application to Quacks and Empiricks, by Men of all Ranks
<PB N="65" REF="72">and Degrees, even to the mo&s;t ex|alted Stations, is &s;o publick and &s;o va&s;t a Di&s;couragement to the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ick, that it may truly be &s;aid to threaten the very Ruin and De&s;truction of the Art it &s;elf. For as &s;uch a Di&s;couragement mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily le&s;&s;en the Number of the Profe&s;&s;ors in Phy&s;ick; &s;o it will con&s;equently ob&s;truct the glorious Progre&s;s of the Art, by hindring further Inventions, and future Im|provements in it. And how inca|pable the illiterate Pretenders in Phy&s;ick are of improving either them&s;elves or the Art, has been al|ready demon&s;trated. We may then very fairly &s;uppo&s;e there will be but few Students in Phy&s;ick, if after all the Labour and Pains of Acquiring that Knowledge, and after all the Expences of a Learned Education; their Bread &s;hall be taken off their Trenchers, as we &s;ay, by every Il|literate
<PB N="66" REF="73">Pretender. What a mo&s;t ingenious Author ob&s;erves upon a|nother Occa&s;ion is very applicable to this. If we con&s;ider, &s;ays he, the Expen&s;ivene&s;s of the Voyage, which is made in &s;earch of Know|ledge, 'tis very hard the Under|takers &s;hould be plunder'd of what they bring home by Privateers; under the very Canon which &s;hould protect them. All which Con&s;ide|rations are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, how far the Encouragement of Quacks and Empiricks ob&s;tructs the Pro|gre&s;s of that glorious Art which teaches the Recovery as well as the Pre&s;ervation of Health; and con|&s;equently threatens the Ruin of the Profe&s;&s;ion as well as the People.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The fourth and la&s;t Argu|ment which I &s;hall offer for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Regulation in the Practice of Phy&s;ick, regards the
<PB N="67" REF="74">Phy&s;icians them&s;elves, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Profe&s;&s;ion is &s;o invaded with un|qualify'd Pretenders, as theirs. I do not doubt, but 'twill evidently appear, that &s;uch an Inva&s;ion is &s;ingular to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy|&s;ick, notwith&s;tanding what &s;ome have endeavour'd, tho' without a|ny Colour of Rea&s;on, to maintain. 'Tis well known that Divinity and Law have their Pali&s;adoes and In|trenchements; for who dare pretend in their Pulpits or Courts, but tho&s;e who are fairly initiated ac|cording to Form and Cu&s;tom? Whereas the Cobweb Fences of Phy&s;ick are every Day invaded, any broken Weaver, Taylor, Shoe|maker, or merry Andrew, dub|bing him&s;elf a Doctor <HI>Extempore,</HI> and &s;etting up for a AESCULAPIUS. So that Quacking and Ale-keeping are now a days become the la&s;t Employments, to which Men of
<PB N="68" REF="75">decay'd Fortunes apply them&s;elves to get Bread. And as none but tho&s;e who are fairly Initiated or Admitted do pre&s;ume upon the Profe&s;&s;ions either of Divinity or Law; &s;o there is but one way of Initiating or Admitting Per&s;ons into the Exerci&s;e of them. Where|as on the other &s;ide, Men are ad|mitted to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick by the mo&s;t Unrea&s;onable, and as they are at pre&s;ent manag'd, I may with Im|punity, I hope, venture to &s;ay, &s;candalous Methods; I mean by Licences out of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts. But that the Hard&s;hip of the Phy&s;icians Ca&s;e may be &s;et in the cleare&s;t Light, 'twill be nece&s;|&s;ary to enquire into the original End and De&s;ign, as well as pre|&s;ent Management of &s;uch Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical Licences: I am well enough &s;atisfy'd that their original End and De&s;ign was very good and laudable.
<PB N="69" REF="76">The Statute of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. 3.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Pulton</HI>'s Statutes.</NOTE> very pathetically expre&s;&s;es the Inconve|niencies en&s;uing by Ignorant Per|&s;ons practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick, to the high Di&s;plea&s;ure of God, great Infamy to the Faculty, and the grievous Hurt, Damage, and De&s;truction of his Maje&s;ties liege Subjects. For all which Rea&s;ons it enacts that the Bi&s;hop of each Dioce&s;e, or his Vi|car-General, be empower'd to ex|amine all tho&s;e (except Graduates) who &s;hall practice Phy&s;ick in that Dioce&s;e. But the Wi&s;dom of the &s;ame Statute is no le&s;s remarkable in obli|ging either of them to call to him &s;uch expert Per&s;ons in the &s;aid Fa|culty, as his Di&s;cretion &s;hall think fit. For I hope, I may venture to declare my Opinion thus far, that I cannot but think the Gentlemen of tho&s;e Courts very unfit Judges
<PB N="70" REF="77">of a Man's Capacity to practice Phy&s;ick. And therefore in 14 and 15 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. 5. it is &s;till, I think, more prudentially enacted, That none &s;hall practice in the Country, without a Te&s;timonial of his Suffi|ciency from the Pre&s;ident of the College of Phy&s;icians, and three of the Electors. I &s;hall not here pretend to determine how far this po&s;terior may be &s;aid to abrogate or null the prior Act. But the very End and De&s;ign of the&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Licences, <HI>viz.</HI> Prevention of the Inconveniences en&s;uing by Ignorant Per&s;ons practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick, is not only, as they are manag'd at pre|&s;ent, wholly fru&s;trated, but entire|ly perverted: For they are now a|days &s;o far from preventing, that they are the only Means of bringing tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs and Inconvenien|cies upon us, which the Statute mentions, by admitting &s;uch Shoals
<PB N="71" REF="78">of unqualified Per&s;ons to practice Phy&s;ick. That the Examination previous to Admi&s;&s;ion was former|ly &s;trict and &s;evere, is as cer|tain as that now a days Per&s;ons are admitted without any manner of Examination at all. Nay, &s;o far is the Practice of the&s;e Courts cor|rupted, and the very End and De|&s;ign of the&s;e Licences perverted, that they are now a days granted e|ven from a Te&s;timonial of two Li|centiates. Can any thing then be more evidently apparent than the Nece&s;&s;ity of regulating the&s;e Mat|ters? For tho' (as I before ob&s;erv'd) the fir&s;t End and De&s;ign of the&s;e Licences was undoubtedly Good and Laudable, and tho' they were not Injurious (and I am apt to think they were not originally de&s;ign'd to be or indeed really were) to the Regular Phy&s;icians; yet if the Rea|&s;on of a Law cea&s;es, the Law
<PB N="72" REF="79">it &s;elf ought to be annull'd. But &s;ince the Method of Examina|tion is &s;o very much alter'd; the Original End and De&s;ign of the&s;e Licences, &s;o manife&s;tly per|verted, and they them&s;elves be|come &s;o va&s;tly Injurious both to the Faculty, and the Regular Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ick; the&s;e very Con|&s;iderations are &s;o many Arguments <HI>a fortiori</HI> for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Re|gulation. And now I appeal to the &s;en&s;ible Part of Mankin, whe|ther any Profe&s;&s;ion be &s;o invaded with unqualified Pretenders as Phy&s;ick; and con&s;equently whe|ther the Phy&s;icians have not the greate&s;t Rea&s;on in the World to complain. And to whom &s;hould they complain, but to the Legi&s;la|ture? For doubtle&s;s, it was one of the Ends of Parliamentary In|&s;titution to receive the Complaints, and redre&s;s the Grievances of the
<PB N="73" REF="80">Injur'd. Nay, do we not find the Legi&s;lature frequently interpo&s;ing in other Profe&s;&s;ions to prevent or remove Grievances; but what Re|gard has there been to the mo&s;t e|normous ones in Phy&s;ick? Are not our Lives worthy the Care of the Laws, as well as our Souls or E&s;tates?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now endeavour to obviate &s;ome Objections which are general|ly made, tho' indeed without any Shadow of Rea&s;on, again&s;t what I have advanc'd. And it has been objected in the fir&s;t Place, that &s;uch a Regulation would be an Abridg|ment of the Natural Rights and Liberties of Mankind, to follow tho&s;e Employments whereby they may get a Livelihood. I &s;hould be the mo&s;t unwilling Man in the World to advance any thing which has the lea&s;t Tendency to &s;uch an Abridgment. No, I have the ten|dere&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="81">Regard to their Civil as well as religious Properties. But this Objection would equally hold a|gain&s;t the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Gaming and other di&s;orderly Hou&s;es, of the <HI>Royal Oak,</HI> and other &s;uch publick Nu&s;ances. For if the Good of the Publick ought not to be con&s;ider'd and prefer'd to that of private Per|&s;ons, which I take to be an undenia|ble Maxim in all Governments; the Natural Liberties of Mankind may as properly be &s;aid to be abridg'd by &s;uch a Suppre&s;&s;ion, as by &s;uch a Regulation as I contend for. The &s;ame An&s;wer will &s;erve to &s;ome other Objections, which are much of the &s;ame Nature, and of no greater Force than the former, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Legi&s;lature is under no manner of Obligation to concern it &s;elf in Mi&s;chiefs which Men vo|luntarily pull upon them&s;elves; That all flouri&s;hing Governments
<PB N="75" REF="82">will encourage their People &s;ome Way or other to employ them|&s;elves; That every Man is <HI>&s;ui Ju|ris,</HI> and has a natural Right of making U&s;e of any Body he plea&s;es, and if he be &s;atisfy'd with the Ri&s;que he runs, what has any one to &s;ay in contradiction to his Humour.</P>
<P>I now proceed to invalidate &s;ome Excu&s;es which are frequently made in Extenuation of tho&s;e Practices which I have been condemning. And a great many People I am apt to believe, will think to clear them|&s;elves from the Imputation of En|couraging Quacks and Empiricks, by &s;aying, That it is only in the Beginning of Di&s;ea&s;es they apply to them; That in Ca&s;es of Dan|ger, they generally have Recour&s;e to better Advice; and, That this Cu&s;tom being &s;o very common, does not &s;eem to need any manner
<PB N="76" REF="83">of Excu&s;e: But upon a &s;tricter En|quiry into this Matter, the Cu&s;tom of fir&s;t &s;ending for an Apothecary or other Quack, will not, I am apt to think, appear the le&s;s ridicu|lous, for being &s;o frequent. For, as the Beginning of a Di&s;temper is a very &s;ea&s;onable Opportunity of A&s;&s;i&s;ting Nature, towards the Re|covery of Health, &s;o the Conduct of tho&s;e People cannot be &s;ufficient|ly condemn'd, who neglect to im|prove that Opportunity, by not then calling in a judicious A&s;&s;i&s;tant. But far more egregious is the Fol|ly of tho&s;e who then apply them|&s;elves to any of the Empirical Tribe; it being impo&s;&s;ible, as has been ob&s;erv'd, but &s;uch Per&s;ons mu&s;t make either in&s;ignificant and u&s;ele&s;s, or dangerous and de&s;tru|ctive Applications. And as the Con&s;ideration of neglecting the Im|provement of this Opportunity
<PB N="77" REF="84">&s;ufficiently condemns the Applica|tion to tho&s;e who are call'd &s;afe Men; who, as they &s;ay them&s;elves, will do no Hurt if they do no Good; &s;o the pre&s;umptuous Tamperers, on the other Side, may not only ir|reparably injure the Patient, but &s;o quite change the Face of a Di&s;tem|per, as to render it very difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, for even a judicious Phy&s;i|cian, when call'd in, to di&s;cover its Nature. But when a Phy&s;ici|an has the Care of a Di&s;ea&s;e from the Beginning, he is able to make right Ob&s;ervations of the Progre&s;s and Alteration of its Symptoms; and con&s;equently, not only to form a &s;urer Progno&s;tication of its Event, but more effectually to a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature in the Pre&s;ervation of Life.</P>
<P>Again, there are others who pre|tend to excu&s;e them&s;elves for not ap|plying to the be&s;t Advice upon the Account of &s;aving Charges; tho' this
<PB N="78" REF="85">Con&s;ideration can be of no manner of Force, unle&s;s it can be thought an Excu&s;e to have the Chance of be|ing kill'd cheap. But would tho&s;e very People, who &s;atisfy them&s;elves with the Advice of an Empirical Pre|tender, but u&s;e their Arithmetick, they would &s;oon be convinc'd, they acted as much again&s;t their Intere&s;t as Rea&s;on. For by phy&s;icking the Symptoms, and neglecting the Cau&s;e of a Di&s;ea&s;e, the Length of the Bill, as well as the Di&s;temper, mu&s;t be con&s;equently encreas'd. 'Tis not the collu&s;ive Pretence of giving Advice without a Fee, which can or ought to be e&s;teem'd an Equivalent.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome again who pre|tend to excu&s;e them&s;elves by plead|ing, that tho&s;e to whom they ap|ply, are Ma&s;ters of &s;ome magni|fied Receipt, or pretended infalli|ble Remedy for this or that Di&s;tem|per.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="86">
<P>But the Vanity of confiding in &s;uch Trifles has been &s;ufficiently ex|pos'd by the plaine&s;t Demon&s;tration, That the mo&s;t celebrated Prepara|tions even of the Philo&s;ophers by Fire are not capable of curing Di&s;|ea&s;es, without a Judicious and Me|thodical Application. I &s;hall there|fore only &s;ubjoin another Con&s;ide|ration, which is an unan&s;werable Argument of their In&s;ufficiency, <HI>viz.</HI> That none of the&s;e magnified Receipts or infallible <HI>No&s;trums</HI> have ever &s;tood the Te&s;t of an Age. Accordingly, our very own Experi|ence is &s;o far from confirming, that it daily contradicts the Pretended Vir|tues which the Alchymical Writers, and the publick Venders of Quack Medicines, with a peremptory A&s;|&s;urance a&s;cribe to them.</P>
<P>'Tis urg'd again, that tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that very ea&s;ily cu|rable Di&s;ea&s;es are often made fatal
<PB N="80" REF="87">by Quacks; yet 'tis equally true, that &s;everal Per&s;ons recover under their Hands. To this I an&s;wer, That they recover, 'tis true, when the Patients have more of their na|tural Vigour than the others are able to de&s;troy, and rather to the Strength of Nature is the happy E|vent to be a&s;crib'd, than to the Judgment of the Medicinal Admi|ni&s;trator; &s;uch Particular Ca&s;es being no more Arguments of their Skill than a blind Man's throwing Stones, and hitting &s;ome People in a Crowd is an Argument of the Goodne&s;s of his Aim.</P>
<P>Having thus fairly and impar|tially repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;ick in this Kingdom, plainly indicated the Number of Quacks, with which it is &s;o unhappy as to abound; and fully demon&s;trated not only the Impo&s;&s;ibility of their being &s;erviceable, but the ab&s;olute
<PB N="81" REF="88">Nece&s;&s;ity of their being injurious to it, in the Exerci&s;e of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion they pretend to: I think no|thing can be more con&s;equentially evident than the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Re|gulation in the Practice of Phy&s;ick. And I am not without Hopes, that &s;ome of the above-mention'd Rea|&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> The Good of her Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects in General; The Honour and Advantages of Her Univer&s;ities in particular; The Life and Reputation of &s;o u&s;eful an Art as Phy&s;ick; or the Particular Hard&s;hips, which the Gentlemen of that Faculty have the Misfor|tune to labour under; I am not without Hopes, I &s;ay, that &s;ome of the&s;e Rea&s;ons will &s;o far influ|ence our Legi&s;lators, as to prevail with them to take the Repre&s;enta|tion of this Ca&s;e into their imme|diate Con&s;ideration: It is a Ca&s;e undoubtedly, of the greate&s;t Mo|ment
<PB N="82" REF="89">and Importance; for as the Life and Health of every individu|al Subject, &s;o con&s;equently all Ranks and Qualities, all Parties and Di&s;tinctions of Men are in the highe&s;t Degree, and equally con|cern'd in it. And as the great Im|portance of the Debate makes it not unworthy the Cognizance and En|quiry of our Legi&s;lators; &s;o the ve|ry Nature of it &s;eems more particu|larly to recommend it &s;elf to their Con&s;ideration. For 'tis certainly a great Shame, as well as an Unhap|pine&s;s, that in a Kingdom where &s;o many good Laws are in Force, and in which as much Care is taken of the Liberties and Properties of the Sub|ject, as in any Nation upon Earth, the People &s;hould lie open and un|guarded in their deare&s;t and mo&s;t va|luable Enjoyments, Health and Life. There is nothing, therefore, which in my Opinion &s;eems more plainly
<PB N="83" REF="90">to demon&s;trate a Deficiency in our Laws, than the Want of &s;ome to Regulate the gro&s;s Mi&s;carriages and enormous Abu&s;es in the Practice of Phy&s;ick. The College of Phy&s;icians, 'tis true, is ve&s;ted with &s;ome Mea|&s;ure of Authority; But as their Au|thority is confin'd to certain Limits; &s;o, through Want of an Enlarge|ment of their Charter, it is not at pre&s;ent of that U&s;e as &s;eems corre|&s;pondent to the De&s;ign of its Royal In&s;titution: But either by enlarging the Charter to the Colledge of Phy|&s;icians, or by &s;uch Ways and Means as the Wi&s;dom of our Legi&s;lature &s;hall better approve of; there &s;eems nothing more fea&s;ible than to make a &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion again&s;t the&s;e pernicious and de&s;tructive Practices. And whenever it &s;hall &s;eem expedi|ent to tho&s;e who &s;it at the Helm of our excellent Government, to un|dertake &s;o u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary a
<PB N="84" REF="91">Work; I humbly recommend,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the di&s;tinct Spheres of Phy&s;icians, Surgeons, and Apothe|caries, be limited and &s;pecified; The Surgeons re&s;train'd to their pro|per Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Apothecaries con|fin'd to their Shops; and all illite|rate and Empirical Pretenders in Phy&s;ick &s;uppre&s;s'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. That a Provi&s;ion be made for the Poor to have their Share in the be&s;t Advice and Medicines.</P>
<P>As the Want of &s;uch a Regulation in Phy&s;ick is one of the greate&s;t Flaws in our Con&s;titution; and highly reflects upon the be&s;t of Go|vernments, &s;o &s;uch a Regulation would undoubtedly tend as much to the Honour of our Nation, as the Pre&s;ervation of its People; and which not only the pre&s;ent, but all &s;ucceeding Generations will have the greate&s;t Rea&s;on in the World to ap|plaud.</P>
