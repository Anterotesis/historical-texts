<P>ANY attempt to in&s;truct the bulk of Man|kind in the Science of Medicine, by en|deavouring to di&s;cu&s;s the Nature and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t, at fir&s;t view, appear equally ab|&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. But to explain the princi|pal Cau&s;es which affect Health and induce Di&s;|ea&s;e, to illu&s;trate &s;o much of the Animal Oeco|nomy as this intention requires, and, by the&s;e means, to render people le&s;s &s;trangers to them|&s;elves, and more capable of pre&s;erving Health and Life, (as, I believe, there is no other Treati&s;e of the &s;ame Kind) &s;eems to me a laudable Endeavour, and con&s;i&s;tent with every purpo&s;e of benevolence and humanity. Such is the de&s;ign of this E&s;&s;ay, and &s;uch the motives for its Publication. In this little Pro|duction I have particularly &s;tudied to be conci&s;e, and to convey, without entering into Detail, as much practical information as po&s;&s;ible, on a &s;mall, ea&s;y Scale. I have taken care not to in|troduce any groundle&s;s theoretical &s;peculation, nor have I even hazarded a &s;ingle a&s;&s;ertion, but what my own inquiry and ob&s;ervation have re|peatedly proved and confirmed to my Satisfac|tion.
<PB N="vi" REF="4">If my Analy&s;is and Explanation of the Mind be more compatible with fair rea&s;on and &s;ound philo&s;ophy, if it be a more accurate inve&s;t|tigation of phy&s;ical and moral analogy, and more clearly demon&s;trative of all the Phaenomena of the human Sy&s;tem, than any other that has yet appeared, it will not, I hope, be deemed vague or delu&s;ive, becau&s;e it wants the &s;anction of a greater name.</P>

<PB REF="7">
<P>THE Di&s;ea&s;es incidental to the human Body are corre&s;pondent, to the Num|ber of external, and internal Cau&s;es which are capable of affecting it, and to the Na|ture and State of the Animal Structure.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e Things which act immediately upon the Body, or make Impre&s;&s;ion on it, at a Di&s;tance, through the Medium of the Sen&s;es, the Changes that happen in the Atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds us, and in the Air we breathe, con&s;titute the general, external Cau&s;es that affect Health.</P>
<P>The principal internal Cau&s;es may be reckoned Sleep, and the Quantity, Quality, and Modification of &s;uch Things as are re|ceived into the Stomach.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<P>The particular Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es depend upon the State of the Animal Oeconomy.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, I &s;hall make &s;ome general Ob&s;ervations, for the Purpo&s;e of Elucida|tion, and afterwards con&s;ider the Subject, as it naturally ari&s;es from the&s;e three Heads.</P>
<P>The proper Standard of Health is that State, in which all the component Parts of the Body (as a Machine) are equally firm to re&s;i&s;t, pliant to yield, and proportionable to be regular. This con&s;titutes an Equili|brium or proper Ballance. To pre&s;erve, or re&s;tore this Ballance is Health, and every con&s;iderable Degree of Variation from it, is an equal Degree of Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The human Fabric may be divided into two different Sy&s;tems. The one is the Sy&s;tem of Ve&s;&s;els or Tubes, which performs the Circulation of the Fluids, and is con|ducted on plain mechanical Principles: and the other is the Nervous Sy&s;tem, which
<PB N="3" REF="9">con&s;i&s;ts of all tho&s;e Parts that have Sen&s;i|bility and Motion, and who&s;e Properties are more difficult to explain.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two Sy&s;tems are happily ballanced and proportioned, all the Powers and Functions of the Body, as well as of the Mind, come neare&s;t to a State of Regu|larity and Perfection.</P>
<P>In all my Re&s;earches into the Nature and Principles of the human Mind, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I can di&s;cern no one &s;ingle Ope|ration of it di&s;tinct from, and unconnected with the Body.</P>
<P>That there mo&s;t certainly is a prime Move|ment, general Sen&s;ory, or a concentrated Power, which is the Origin of all the Fa|culties and Offices of the Body, and that this Power re&s;ides, or begins, within the Brain, Anatomical Di&s;&s;ections, and the Ob&s;ervations of common Sen&s;e unque&s;tion|ably demon&s;trate. To define the Magni|tude, Quantity, or Proportion of this
<PB N="4" REF="10">Power, is utterly impo&s;&s;ible, and to &s;ay that it is immaterial, or that it is &s;omething which has no Parts, is, po&s;itively, to &s;ay that it is Nothing at all.</P>
<P>This Power is be&s;t known, and I think mo&s;t happily de&s;cribed by the common Terms, Mind, Life or Soul. Now, al|though I profe&s;s, and indeed mu&s;t treat of this Power or Mind as an e&s;&s;ential and or|ganic Part of the human Structure, I am ready, at the &s;ame Time, to declare (lea&s;t I &s;hould mi&s;lead the weak or ignorant) that this Doctrine ought not, nor, by any Means, can be deemed repugnant to the Belief of Immortality, or a future State of Exi&s;tence. On the contrary, it places human Nature in a rational Light, and will be found to obviate and reconcile tho&s;e Difficulties which occur in con&s;idering this nice Point.</P>
<P>For where is the Objection, in Re&s;pect of Rea&s;on or Philo&s;ophy, again&s;t the Opinion that this Power, Soul, Mind, or animating E&s;&s;ence of the Body, immutable in its Pro|perties, may, at the final Hour, &s;ublime,
<PB N="5" REF="11">as it were, from the Caput-Mortuum, that is, &s;oar aloft, and &s;urvive the gro&s;&s;er Materials, which the Laws of &s;pecific Gravity fix to the Earth, and the Texture of Parts &s;ubjects to Separation and Di&s;&s;olution?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and leading Feature in the Phy&s;iognomy of the Mind is a Quality, Ca|pability, or inherent Nece&s;&s;ity of perceiving all Manner of Impre&s;&s;ions whatever.</P>
<P>From this &s;imple Power of Perception, fir&s;t, Similitude or Re&s;emblance of Things, then, Memory, Compari&s;on, Reflection, Deliberation, and in &s;hort, all the regular and progre&s;&s;ive Operations of the Mind (by Means of an intrin&s;ic, or uncea&s;ing Move|ment) may be ea&s;ily conceived to proceed.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o called, form another Cla&s;s of Operations, more energetic than the former, becau&s;e in them, the Impre&s;|&s;ions are external, immediate, and impetu|ous, and the Perceptions, therefore, recipro|cally, more vigorous.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<P>Thus, Anger proceeds from violent Agi|tations, Fear is produced by &s;uch as are &s;trong and quick, Joy ari&s;es from vivid, and Grief from deep Impre&s;&s;ions. Hope is the Re&s;ult of &s;oft and agreeable Emo|tions. Which Circum&s;tance proves in the cleare&s;t Manner, that the Enjoyments of Life infinitely &s;urpa&s;s the Mi&s;eries of it, &s;ince Hope, by being con&s;tantly in Exerci&s;e, becomes habitual, and never leaves the Mind, except for very &s;hort and almo&s;t im|perceptible Intervals. This Argument yields a good Le&s;&s;on for Patience and Con|tentment in every po&s;&s;ible Situation. Love, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Mind, differs from all the re&s;t. It is clo&s;ely interwoven with the Animal Frame, and draws its Impul&s;e (of all others the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible) from Springs which act, within, as well as from Objects that excite, without.</P>
<P>Images, which pre&s;ent to the Mind, Beauty, Harmony, and Symmetry, produce
<PB N="7" REF="13">plea&s;ing Emotions; tho&s;e, which convey the contrary Qualities, are accompanied with painful Sen&s;ations. The former of the&s;e give a free and full Motion to the Nervous Power; a &s;hort, quick, and con|tracted Movement is the Con&s;equence of the latter.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation may be applied with more Force and Conviction than all the ela|borate and ingenious Arguments that can be adduced, (either in Favour, or in Oppo&s;ition to the Doctrine,) in Te&s;timony of the natu|ral A&s;cendency of moral Virtue in the hu|man Mind.</P>
<P>It &s;hews that Beauty, Order, Dignity and Happine&s;s are amiable to the Mind of Man, and illuminate with congenial Rays the elevated Faculties of the Soul; while Deformity, Turpitude, Vice, and Mi&s;ery compo&s;e the horrid Contra&s;t, that di&s;graces Society, degrades the Mind, and brutalizes the Species.</P>
<P>None of the Mental Affections or Opera|tions, as long as they continue to create re|gular
<PB N="8" REF="14">and plea&s;ing Sen&s;ations, by any Means, injure, but on the contrary, promote Health. The Pa&s;&s;ions or Affections of the Mind, therefore, affect Health, and di&s;order the Sy&s;tem, in Con&s;equence of, and in Propor|tion to the Impetuo&s;ity, Pain and Duration of the Impre&s;&s;ions or Images which actuate, or excite them, and in no other Way.</P>
<P>Anger, Fear, Hatred, Shame, Grief, Anxiety, Jealou&s;y, Envy, Pride, Malice and Revenge (to which I may add Study) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es each of them, a certain Modifica|tion of the characteri&s;tic Marks above de&s;|cribed; and all of them produce &s;imilar Effects upon the Animal Sy&s;tem, different only, in Degree, and in Point of Continua|tion. Love, Hope, and Joy mu&s;t rank differently from the other Pa&s;&s;ions, as their Effects are injurious to the Sy&s;tem, only when they are violent and exce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind then, (agree|able to the Limitations pointed out) irritate the Nervous Sy&s;tem, who&s;e Tubes &s;erve
<PB N="9" REF="15">as Conductors from the Brain throughout the whole Body, in &s;uch a Manner as to produce Spa&s;m. Now Spa&s;m is a Motion or O&s;cillation (whether in the va&s;cular or mu&s;cular Parts, it makes no Difference) &s;o extremely quick, in Point of Succe&s;&s;ion or Alternation, that the Intermi&s;&s;ions or In|tervals become imperceptible to the Sen&s;es. This is a &s;eeming Paradox, an Exce&s;s, and at the &s;ame Time, an Interruption of the nervous Influence.</P>
<P>The &s;pa&s;modic Stimulus or Effort, thus produced by the Pa&s;&s;ions, particularly affects the Head, the Lungs, and the Womb. Hence Madne&s;s, Fainting, Convul&s;ions, Hy&s;terics, A&s;thma, &amp;c. It di&s;orders the Stomach and Inte&s;tinal Canal, occa&s;ioning Colics, Flatulency and Indige&s;tion. It con&s;tringes the Surface of the Skin, and all the nervous Parts and Tubes, and thus blocks up the Per&s;piration, and the other Secretions; and by the&s;e Means, brings Fevers, Ob&s;tructions, Scurvy, Nervous Di&s;orders, Melancholy, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="16">
<P>Vehement and &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ions, by means of Spa&s;m, &s;ometimes retard and check, for a Moment, the progre&s;&s;ive Motion of the Nervous Influence in the Brain it&s;elf. Hence a general Relaxation, and involun|tary Di&s;charge of the Faeces and Urine, a Circum&s;tance which happens not &s;eldom, in Ca&s;es of extreme Fright or Terror.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Law paints the inward Feel|ings upon the Mu&s;cles of the Face, by various Contractions and Relaxations, it gives the Pencil its fine&s;t Stroke, and fulle&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion in the genuine Language of the Eyes, and thus confirms the Face the Index, or Proxy of the Mind.</P>
<P>The immoderate or inordinate Pa&s;&s;ions and Agitations of the Mind are mo&s;t effec|tually prevented, by avoiding, as much as po&s;&s;ible, every exciting Cau&s;e, and cul|tivating Habits of Equanimity and Firm|ne&s;s, which, with every other valuable Accompli&s;hment of the Mind, are chiefly to be acquired from Education, or, in
<PB N="11" REF="17">other Words, an exten&s;ive, and well cho&s;en Fund of Ideas.</P>
<P>This is a Re&s;ource which invigorates and exalts the Mind, expands the Rea&s;on, fur|ni&s;hes the Aids of Philo&s;ophy, and &s;upplies an inexhau&s;tible Store of different Thoughts and various Imagery.</P>
<P>But no particular Management, nor any Mode of Acce&s;s or immediate Application whatever to the Mind, can counteract the Di&s;advantages of an unhealthy and infirm Habit of Body. Pain mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;our the Temper, and make it ha&s;ty, moro&s;e and ira&s;cible. Relaxation creates Peevi&s;h|ne&s;s and Imbecillity, and renders the Mind irritable, timid, too &s;u&s;ceptible of every Impre&s;&s;ion, and liable to Mi&s;conception; and Ob&s;truction, which is generally the Companion of Relaxation, adds Gloom, Melancholy, Anxiety, and a di&s;ordered Imagination to the baneful Catalogue.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, in tho&s;e Habits or Temperatures, in which the Powers and
<PB N="12" REF="18">Functions of the Sy&s;tem ri&s;e above the Line of Mediocrity, or Standard of Health, and occa&s;ion Irregularity only on that Account, the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Mind receives the Stamp, and wears the Colours of Pride, Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, Vanity, and De&s;ire. The&s;e, moreover, have not &s;o &s;ad a Complexion, nor &s;o &s;ickly an A&s;pect as the former, and be&s;ides are much more ea&s;ily reduced to the proper Equilibrium.</P>
<P>In all Ca&s;es where the Pa&s;&s;ions are once excited, the be&s;t Antidote is the creation of new and oppo&s;ite Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Change the Objects, &s;hift the Scene, &s;ooth the Mind, and compo&s;e the Body, and if Need be, fortify it al&s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rules are applicable in &s;udden Emotions, as Anger, Fear, &amp;c. and are equally appo&s;ite in the Pa&s;&s;ions of &s;u&s;|pended Love, Grief, Jealou&s;y, &amp;c. where there is always &s;ome Image permanently re|pre&s;ented, and, in a Manner, &s;ettled upon
<PB N="13" REF="19">the Mind. But to conquer the latter will require Time and Per&s;ervance.</P>
<P>Grief ought to be amu&s;ed, and &s;up|planted by Hope, Fidelity and Con&s;olation mu&s;t &s;often the edge of Jealou&s;y, and Love &s;hould certainly be gratified, if po&s;&s;ible; or if that cannot be done, (&s;ince as I &s;aid be|fore, it has a double Claim) it mu&s;t be al|lowed every rea&s;onable Indulgence, and &s;hould undoubtedly meet Returns of Sym|pathy and Tenderne&s;s, &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>None of the Pa&s;&s;ions will admit of too &s;udden a Check. It is much better to en|deavour to &s;uper&s;ede them, by Means of other, plea&s;ant, Sen&s;ations, than to attempt, all at once, to &s;tifle and re&s;train them. The Irritation on the Nerves, when once excited, mu&s;t have &s;ome Play. It &s;eeks a Vent through one Channel or another, and if it bur&s;t out in a Flood of Tears, a Fit of Laughter, or a Flow of Words, it may be reckoned a very favourable Termi|nation.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="20">
<P>The Air is an invi&s;ible, ela&s;tic Fluid, which covers and enclo&s;es the Earth, and pre&s;&s;es upon the Surface of all Bodies, with an amazing Weight.</P>
<P>The Air acts upon the Animal Sy&s;tem, in various Ways. It &s;timulates, more or le&s;s, in all Circum&s;tances; it relaxes or braces according to the Degree of Heat, or Cold, which pervades it; the Lungs are inflated and expanded with a greater or le&s;&s;er Force, adequate to its Ela&s;ticity or Purity; and it ab&s;orbs and receives the diaphoretic Vapour from the Surface of the Skin as well as of the Lungs, in Proportion to its Dryne&s;s and Warmth.</P>
<P>The Air, in general, is mo&s;t &s;alubrious, in high Situations, in tho&s;e Places where it has a free Circulation, and al&s;o near the Sea-Coa&s;t, and in the Vicinity of Rivers, and flowing Water. Air, impregnated with foreign Particles, overcharged with Moi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">, or phlogi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ated by the Heat of the Sun, the Action of Fire, by &s;ulphure|ous
<PB N="15" REF="21">Vapours, the Breath of Animals, and &s;uchlike, is mo&s;t unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>In A&s;thmas, Con&s;umptions, and Nervous Complaints, the Temperature of the Air is a material Con&s;ideration, and of great Im|portance. A light, dry, and warm Air is be&s;t for weak, and di&s;ea&s;ed Lungs, and a dry and cold, or temperate Air is fitte&s;t for relaxed, and nervous People.</P>
<P>The Benefit of Change of Air is known to every Body, and many People find, by Experience, that a Change even to a more indifferent Air is &s;ometimes attended with Advantage. The Rea&s;on of which is ma|nife&s;t from what has been already &s;aid con|cerning the Qualities and Effects of Air. The Changes of Air ought not, in any Ca&s;e, to be too &s;udden, or too much in the extreme; the more gradual they are, the le&s;s Danger is incurred.</P>

<P>The Reaching and Vomiting occa&s;ioned by Sea &s;ickne&s;s, which has been generally accounted hazardous, ought not, by any Means, to intimidate. If the Di&s;ea&s;e be &s;eated in the glandular Parts of the Lungs, if it be of the &s;crophulous Kind, or of an hydropic Nature, or if a general Infarction, or local Plenitude of the Lungs give Ri&s;e to it, (and thus circum&s;tanced indeed from one or more of the&s;e Cau&s;es, the Di&s;ea&s;e is
<PB N="17" REF="23">mo&s;t frequently to be met with) in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, I &s;ay, Sea Sickne&s;s and Vomiting mu&s;t be undeniably u&s;eful. If even a Suppuration or Abce&s;s be forming, or already formed, the Ca&s;e is then &s;o ex|ceedingly dangerous, that there &s;till remain more Chances in Favour of, than again&s;t the Patient. Be&s;ides there is a peculiar Kind of Relaxation prevailing in the Sy&s;tem from the vertiginous Nature of that Sick|ne&s;s, &s;o that the Action of Vomiting is per|formed with le&s;s Danger of rupturing any Ve&s;&s;els, and the Ejections from the Sto|mach are more abundant than in Vomiting produced from any other Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e de&s;erve Notice, in this Place, that aged People, who may happen to be more &s;olicitous to prolong their Exi&s;tence, than concerned in what Lati|tude their A&s;hes are to re&s;t, certainly have it in their Power, <HI>coeteris paribus,</HI> to add a few Years to the Period of their natural Lives, by removing in the Decline of Life, to a hot, tropical Climate.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="24">
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature, and the gene|ral Order of Things demand Action in the human Species, and the Mechani&s;m of the Body plainly &s;hews that it is not only well calculated for that Purpo&s;e, but al&s;o de|monstrates that Exerci&s;e is even indi&s;pen|&s;ibly requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve Regularity in the Wheels of Motion, and to fit them for the due Performance of their &s;everal Offices.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e is like a Main Spring to the Machinery. It promotes the Dige&s;tion, prepares the Blood for its various De&s;tina|tions, di&s;tributes it through all the Chan|nels of Circulation, throws off the imper|fect and offen&s;ive Parts of the Fluids, braces the Nerves, gives a firm Tone to the Solids, and carries an even Flow of Spirits through|out the whole Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e is hurtful immediately after a full Meal, and in the Morning, when the Stomach is quite empty, much Ex|erci&s;e is injurious.</P>
<P>Frequent Walking relieves the Head, abates Rheumatic Pains, keeps the Bowels
<PB N="19" REF="25">open, is favourable to all the de&s;cend|ing Evacuations, and has a Tendency to prevent the Gout: It contributes to ge|neral Health, and by increa&s;ing the Cir|culation and Secretion in the Legs and Feet, (&s;ince the Extremities are the ori|ginal Seat of the Gout) it may perhaps hinder the Formation and A&s;&s;imilation of tho&s;e morbid Particles, which are found to exi&s;t, in a concreted State, in a fixed or &s;ettled Gout.</P>
<P>Riding on Hor&s;e-back is an excellent Exerci&s;e, and e&s;&s;entially beneficial in ob|&s;tructed and nervous Habits, and in all Affections of the Lungs: But when, the Nerves or Bowels are very weak, the be&s;t Sub&s;titute is riding in an open Carriage.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who labour under Ob&s;tructions and Nervous Di&s;orders, &s;hould try the Effects of &s;ome mechanical or dome&s;tic Work, and particularly &s;uch as requires Flexion of the Body, as that Attitude tends, in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure, to give Motion to the &s;tagnant Fluids, in the Vi&s;cera. But when this is the cu&s;|tomary
<PB N="20" REF="26">Po&s;ture in People's common Occu|pation, an Alteration in that Ca&s;e is equally nece&s;&s;ary, as Ob&s;tructions and other Com|plaints, may ari&s;e from, and be much ag|gravated by daily Contortion, or &s;tooping.</P>
<P>Ploughing, and gardening are al&s;o very be|neficial Exerci&s;es for tho&s;e who are in a ca|chectic, nervous, or valitudinary State, as there can be no Doubt but the fre&s;h opened Bo&s;om of the prolific Earth mu&s;t very copiou&s;ly diffu&s;e &s;alubrious Exhalations.</P>
<P>Moderate Dancing, occa&s;ionally, is a valuable Kind of Exerci&s;e.

<P>There are two prevailing Errors, in Regard of Exerci&s;e, which I mu&s;t re|mark.
<PB N="21" REF="27">People of relaxed, delicate and ner|vous Habits, who &s;hould always avoid too much Action, at one Time, often hurt them&s;elves by over Exertion, becau&s;e they judge it advi&s;eable to take Plenty of Ex|erci&s;e. There are others, again, who, be|ing confined within Doors, and leading a &s;edentary Life, think to compen&s;ate for the Want of regular Exerci&s;e, by a hard Ride, or Walk, once a Week. But this is a mi&s;|taken Notion. The Nerves of &s;uch People, unaccu&s;tomed to bear &s;o great a Degree of Agitation, are over&s;trained and relaxed by it, while the Circulation of their Fluids, which is, in general, very &s;low and languid, is thrown into Di&s;order, from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, and thus a Foundation is laid for tho&s;e very Complaints which it was meant to prevent.</P>
<P>Hard Labour, and con&s;tant Exertion evaporates the Nervous Power, di&s;tends and relaxes the Nerves and Ve&s;&s;els, (unle&s;s when Labour is habitual, and then indeed it
<PB N="22" REF="28">has a contrary Effect upon the Solids,) throws off the nutritious Part of the Blood, and thereby wa&s;tes and weakens the Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>In all Ca&s;es whatever, let this be an inva|riable Rule, that real Wearine&s;s and Fa|tigue &s;hould mark the preci&s;e Limits of every Species of Exerci&s;e and Labour.</P>
<P>Cleanline&s;s is accompanied with as much Utility as Comfort, and &s;hould therefore be practi&s;ed, as far as Circum&s;tances will ad|mit, by every one. It is a Matter of no &s;mall Importance to keep the Skin clear and clean: both becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t copious excretory Pa&s;&s;age, of the whole Body, for the &s;uperfluous Diathe&s;is of the Blood, and al&s;o on Account of its being a fine, &s;en&s;ible, nervous Expan&s;ion, holding a high Degree of Sympathy, with all the principal Organs of the Sy&s;tem. Hence the Skin is the principal Drain whereby the Circulation maintains an equal Di&s;tribu|tion, and the Nervous Sy&s;tem pre&s;erves its Equilibrium.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="29">
<P>The Feet &s;hould be particularly attended to. The bathing of them in warm Wa|ter helps to relieve the Head-ach, all Sorts of Colics, and nephritic Pains, and is &s;er|viceable in Fevers, and recent Colds.</P>
<P>As to Clothes, it is always better, e&s;pe|cially in this Climate, to wear too many than too few. Emaciated People recover|ing from Illne&s;s &s;hould have Clothes made to fit clo&s;e. The&s;e would help to brace and re&s;tore them, whereas their old loo&s;e Clothes tend to keep them relaxed, and, at the &s;ame Time admit too much Air.</P>
<P>It is really extraordinary, that any Per|&s;on, (yet one may meet &s;uch every Day) either from Vanity or Ignorance, &s;hould fall into a Cu&s;tom &s;o repugnant to common Sen&s;e, and his own private Feelings, as that of girding the Neck till the Eyes &s;tart, or of wearing Apparel &s;o very tight and fa&s;hionable, that he can neither bend, walk, breathe, nor &s;peak.</P>
<P>Heat relaxes the Nerves and Solids, and rarifies and volatilizes the Fluids, it al&s;o
<PB N="24" REF="30">generates Bile, and prepares the Body for Fluxes, intermittent, putrid, and epidemic Fevers.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who are much expo&s;ed to &s;trong Fires, or to inten&s;e Heat of any Kind, &s;hould wear coar&s;e Linnen, or Cotton next the Skin, &s;hould &s;hift often, and wa&s;h the Face and Hands with cold Water, and a little common Salt di&s;&s;olved in it, twice a Day.</P>
<P>In the Heat of Summer, a moderate Portion of Wine, or Spirits, is quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary, both to &s;upply the Con&s;umption occa&s;ioned by the Increa&s;e of Per&s;piration, and to recruit the exhau&s;ted Strength, and al&s;o to &s;harpen the greater Quantities of di|luting Liquors, which Thir&s;t naturally re|quires. Therefore, one Way with another, there ought to be con&s;umed nearly as much &s;trong Liquor, in the Summer as in the Winter Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>Cold gives Ten&s;ion or Firmne&s;s to the Fibres, conden&s;es the Fluids, compacts the
<PB N="25" REF="31">Texture of the Blood, and predi&s;po&s;es to inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Warm Clothes, Motion, and &s;ufficient Nouri&s;hment are the mo&s;t proper and effec|tual Pre&s;ervatives again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive Cold: And nothing is more prepo&s;terous, or more dangerous than the U&s;e of too much &s;pi|rituous Liquors in cold, &s;evere Weather.</P>
<P>There is hardly any thing more common than to hear People expre&s;s their Surprize at having got Cold, becau&s;e they are alto|gether at a Lo&s;s to account for the Cau&s;e of it. They are not ignorant that damp Air, wet Clothes, the drinking cold Li|quors when the Body is very hot, or too warm Liquors when it is cold, and &s;uch like, are the chief Cau&s;es; but do not con|&s;ider that all &s;udden Tran&s;itions from one Temperature, and one Extreme to another, are equally conducive to the &s;ame Effect, though the Circum&s;tances of it may not be &s;o obvious to them.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="32">
<P>Colds bring on Fevers, Inflammations of the Throat and Lungs, Pleuri&s;ies, Con|&s;umptions, Rheumati&s;ms, Colics, Dia|rrhoeas, Piles, Pal&s;y, &amp;c. and are often &s;o &s;erious in their Con&s;equences, that no Body &s;hould venture to trifle with Colds, even in a &s;light Degree.</P>
<P>In &s;evere, recent Colds that affect the Brea&s;t, Bleeding &s;hould be almo&s;t invari|ably re&s;orted to, and the Per&s;piration re|&s;tored by every Means, except &s;uch as are of too heating a Nature: In Colds which attack the Head, the Regimen ought not be too low, lea&s;t the Complaint &s;hould de&s;cend upon the Lungs.</P>
<P>To wear &s;oft Flannel next the Skin can|not be too &s;trongly recommended to tho&s;e who labour under any Affection of the Lungs, or Weakne&s;s of the Bowels. The &s;ame Expedient will be found &s;erviceable in the Rheumati&s;m, and in all &s;corbutic, drop&s;ical, hypocondriac and melancholic Complaints.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="33">
<P>In each of the above Ca&s;es, &s;trong Friction upon the Skin, e&s;pecially the Re|gion of the Stomach and Bowels, and along the Spine, may be employed with con&s;ider|able Effect.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom of Sea-Bathing, and of drinking the Mineral Waters, on every Occa&s;ion, derives more Support, I doubt, from the powerful Sanction of Fa&s;hion, than from any decided Te&s;timony of their being always &s;alutary and efficacious.</P>
<P>This much I may venture to &s;ay, that they &s;hould be either &s;eldom recurred to, or admini&s;tered with much Di&s;cretion. Many of the Mineral Waters are impreg|nated with very active Ingredients, and by too frequent U&s;e, impair, and wear out the Con&s;titution; and Cold-Bathing is inimi|cal to the Lungs, and in many In&s;tances, has paved the Way for bilious Complaints, and Ob&s;tructions of the Vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>To dip regularly in cold Water, in In|fancy, is highly proper. It checks redun|dant
<PB N="28" REF="34">Growth, &s;trengthens the &s;oft Fibres, and confirms the Stamina.</P>
<P>Sound Sleep, continued for &s;even or eight Hours, is, in general, quite &s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e of Re&s;toration, yet female, and delicate Con&s;titutions require rather more.</P>
<P>Too much Sleep weakens the Nerves, renders the Temper peevi&s;h, and predi&s;po&s;es to Apoplexy and Pal&s;y, it likewi&s;e creates a lethargic and indolent Di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;qua|lifies for Action, and blunts the Energy both of the intellectual and corporeal Facul|ties. On the other Hand, nothing can be more pernicious than the Lo&s;s of Sleep, and Want of due Re&s;t. Watching, by exciting an artificial Fever, and by &s;timu|lating the nervous Sy&s;tem, when its Powers are already exhau&s;ted, effectually wa&s;tes the Strength, debilitates the Body, and lays it open to every Attack, e&s;pecially to nervous and phrenitic Fevers.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="35">
<P>The Duration of Sleep mu&s;t be propor|tioned rather to the Nature of the Con&s;ti|tution, than to the Degree of Exerci&s;e, or Labour. In lax and tender Habits, the natural Motion and Attrition in the Sy&s;tem, exhau&s;t and di&s;&s;ipate the vital Strength much &s;ooner than in tho&s;e Con|&s;tiutions which are hardy and robu&s;t; con|&s;equently, the former require longer Sleep, to repair the Wa&s;te and Con&s;umption, than what is nece&s;&s;ary for the latter. Be&s;ides, in tho&s;e who have much Exerci&s;e, or La|bour, the Powers of Circulation being more complete, and the Sleep more mature, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Nature is &s;ooner performed.</P>
<P>A Life of Labour, and con&s;tant Action is commonly accompanied with Vigour, and good Spirits; but it mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed, that, from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, the Fibres grow rigid, and the fine Tubes become impervious and unfit for Motion and Cir|culation, in a &s;horter Space of Time; hence the Period of Exi&s;tence is &s;hortened, and yet the &s;ame Exi&s;tence, deprived of the &s;a|lutary
<PB N="30" REF="36">Effects of continued Exerci&s;e, might have been prematurely terminated, by the Inva&s;ion of &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e generated from Ea&s;e, Indolence, or Retirement.</P>
<P>Study, or inten&s;e Thought of any Kind, e&s;pecially if fixed on &s;ome individual and intere&s;ting Object, very &s;peedily con&s;umes the Nervous Power, within the Brain, (while the re&s;t of the Sy&s;tem is de&s;titute of its Influence) and therefore requires as long, and indeed longer Sleep to recruit the Strength and repleni&s;h the Spirits, than hard Labour does.</P>
<P>I have noticed that Animals of the op|po&s;ite Gender thrive better when they re&s;t or &s;leep near each other, than tho&s;e of the &s;ame Gender do. I &s;hall not make any Application, but only &s;ay, that, whatever that Circum&s;tance may be owing to, it is &s;urely better to &s;leep alone than with an unhealthy and di&s;agreeable Companion.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="37">
<P>Heavy Suppers, much Reading, Study, or any con&s;iderable Agitation, or Applica|tion of Mind, near the Hour of going to Bed, all tend to prevent &s;ound Sleep, and to occa&s;ion Dreams. The drinking of Tea, Coffee, or any other thin, weak Liquor will al&s;o retard Sleep.</P>
<P>Sound Sleep, properly &s;peaking, is that State of perfect Quiet in the Mind, which does not admit, or rather is not accom|panied with any Perception whatever.</P>
<P>Dreams, therefore, may be termed a Kind of half Sleep, and may be occa&s;ion|ed by any Irritation that excites the &s;malle&s;t Degree of Motion in the Sy&s;tem, beyond that Point of Tranquillity which con&s;titutes, real or &s;ound Sleep. If there be any &s;uch Thing as preternatural Dreams, I confe&s;s my&s;elf entirely unable to account for them.</P>
<P>Fulne&s;s and Flatulency in the Stomach, together with lying on the Back, in Per|&s;ons of relaxed Nerves, are the Cau&s;es of
<PB N="32" REF="38">the Night-Mare. Tho&s;e, accordingly, who are troubled with this unwelcome Gue&s;t, &s;hould &s;trengthen the Nervous Sy&s;|tem, lie upon the Side, and drink a Gla&s;s of Wine, or &s;trong Spirits and Water, going to Bed.</P>
<P>An Appetite for Food or Nouri&s;hment is an almo&s;t infallible Sign of Health: but if the Dige&s;tion be not, at the &s;ame Time, regular and perfect, it is a fal&s;e Appetite, ari&s;ing either from &s;ome preternatural Sti|mulus, or from luxurious Living, hence the Stomach craves more than is nece&s;&s;ary. The Simplicity of Food has numerous Advocates, and there is no Doubt but, the more Variety the Stomach is accu&s;tomed to, the more Dainties, and perhaps the larger Quantities are needful. The Man|ner of Living &s;hould, therefore, be regu|lated from the earlie&s;t Period. The Child|ren of poor People, who are likely to live hard, &s;hould, from the fir&s;t, be accu&s;tom|ed to plain and &s;ub&s;tantial Food, and &s;eldom allowed many Rarities. They
<PB N="33" REF="39">&s;hould learn to take whatever is offered them, to prevent their Stomachs from be|ing too nice; but nothing to which they &s;eem to have a fixed Di&s;like &s;hould be forced upon them: it is as dangerous as it is unnatural.</P>
<P>The Practice of cramming Children with Materials of every Kind, countenanced by &s;ome Gentlemen of the Faculty, with a View to &s;trengthen and corroborate their Stomachs, is too ab&s;urd, in my Opinion, to challenge Animadver&s;ion. Such Treat|ment mu&s;t load them with noxious and &s;uperfluous Humours, train them up for Epicureans, and by over Di&s;ten&s;ion of the Stomach, and Pre&s;&s;ure upon the Lungs, and the adjacent Bowels, it cannot but &s;ow the Seeds of a Multiplicity of Di&s;orders, par|ticularly of the nervous Kind. It mu&s;t al&s;o contribute to weaken their Intellects, and incur the future Danger of apoplectic, epileptic, and paralytic Attacks.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="40">
<P>Gormandizing, or immoderate eating, in grown People, is productive of &s;imilar Con&s;equences, Con&s;equences proportiona|bly more immediate, and de&s;tructive, as the Effects of Repletion, in Maturity, are always more violent and fatal than in Infancy.</P>

<P>The intemperate U&s;e of &s;pirituous Li|quors maintains a continual Fever, de|&s;troys the Tone of the Nerves and Solids,
<PB N="35" REF="41">and at length makes them callous; it inflames the Blood, carries it through the Lungs, and towards the Brain, with great Rapidity, ruptures the Mouths of the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, indurates the Vi&s;cera, or Bowels, and erodes the Kidneys. Hence a Train of complicated Maladies, too tedious to de|&s;cribe or enumerate.</P>
<P>If Liquor be recurred to, with a View to keep up the Spirits, it &s;oon evaporates with the increa&s;ed Flow occasioned by it, if it be u&s;ed to relieve Anxiety of Mind, the tran&s;ient Serenity is quickly &s;ucceeded by a &s;till deeper Gloom, and if it be admitted to exhilarate the &s;ocial Hour of convivial Enjoyment, Moderation &s;hould always fill the Cup, and not &s;uffer one to affront his Friend, de&s;troy his Health, or &s;tupify his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>Animal Food is certainly too freely u&s;ed in this Country. The u&s;ual Proportion &s;timulates too much, gives a den&s;e, or a putre&s;cent Cra&s;is to the Blood, (according
<PB N="36" REF="42">as the Habit is &s;trong, or weak,) and in|duces Acrimony, and thus it ultimately propagates the Cau&s;es of Ob&s;tructions, of putrid, and nervous Di&s;ea&s;es: It generates Bile, is the leading Cau&s;e of the Scurvy, and fo&s;ters the Gout and Rheumati&s;m. At the &s;ame Time it mu&s;t be admitted, that the State of the Air is &s;uch, in Eng|land, as demands a Diet rather warm and &s;timulating, to counteract the moi&s;t, re|laxing Quality of it.</P>
<P>Low and ab&s;temious Living, and a thin, watery, vegetable Diet, robs the Body of competent Nouri&s;hment, unbra|ces the Stomach and Nerves, di&s;&s;olves the Blood, dimini&s;hes the Action of the Ve&s;&s;els, and reduces the Sy&s;tem below the Standard of Health: Hence a Predi&s;po&s;i|tion to all the Di&s;ea&s;es which ari&s;e from Debility and Relaxation. Yet a very &s;len|der Diet, if the Habit has been accu&s;tomed to &s;uch, will pre&s;erve the Ballance, give Spirits and Vivacity, and &s;upply all the Springs of Health: In &s;hort, it is Quan|tity
<PB N="37" REF="43">rather than Quality that repleni&s;hes the Wa&s;te, and affords the true Nutrition of Animal Life. Simple Food (in &s;uffi|cient Quantity) dige&s;ts, circulates, and re|pairs, gradually, &s;moothly, and with Cer|tainty, whereas the rich, high &s;ea&s;oned Repa&s;t occa&s;ions Perturbation, Heat, and Excitement, and thus very frequently di&s;|&s;ipates and carries off, by the different Di&s;charges, a con&s;iderable Portion of nu|tritious Juices, and leaves the Body weak, enervated, and collap&s;ed, in&s;tead of nou|ri&s;hing and recruiting the Sy&s;tem, by its own Addition. Hence it is that high Living demands Luxury to &s;crew up the Nerves to their u&s;ual Pitch, and hence it is al&s;o that, being over-&s;trained, they &s;oon wear out and break.</P>
<P>A Diet, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of Milk and Vegetables, has been found, in &s;everal In|&s;tances, to renovate the Con&s;titution, re|move Sterility, and eradicate &s;ome of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, chronic Complaints.</P>

<P>Regimen, I am convinced, can produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary Effects, but it needs particular Skill to direct it.

<P>Tea and Coffee have long been Subjects of Reprobation with the Faculty; but I am apprehen&s;ive that the&s;e Articles of Living have been too ra&s;hly condemned, with|out proper Inve&s;tigation, or good Grounds.

<P>Porter, fortunately for this Metropolis, is a good, nutritious, whole&s;ome Liquor: yet I doubt there is &s;omething of a narcotic Quality added to it, which ought not to be.

<P>Nothing can be more ridiculous, or more pernicious than the Practice of eating and drinking Things very hot. It &s;poils the Teeth, brings on the Tooth-Ach, weakens the Head and Eyes, ruins the Stomach, and does abundance of Mi&s;chief.</P>

<P>Supper &s;hould be light, and proportion|able to the Degree of Exerci&s;e that is to &s;ucceed. The Quantity of Supper ought ju&s;t to be &s;ufficient to repleni&s;h the Wa&s;te which the different Functions nece&s;&s;arily make. If any more be received into the
<PB N="41" REF="47">Stomach, too great a Portion of the Ner|vous Power is determined to that Organ, and expended there in the Work of Dige&s;|tion, while, at the &s;ame Time, the Super|fluity continues to excite an un&s;ea&s;onable Stimulus in the Sy&s;tem, which &s;hould re|main, as much as po&s;&s;ible, in a quie&s;cent State, during Sleep, and leaves an unnece&s;|&s;ary Quantity of Materials in the Stomach, next Morning, which ought, then, to be nearly empty, and to contain little more be&s;ides the ga&s;tric or common Liquor of the Stomach.</P>
<P>Water, as being a Vehicle particularly connected with all the Departments of Nouri&s;hment, de&s;erves proper Attention. Pure, cold Water acts as a tonic or corrobo|rant, internally, in the Stomach, as well as applied externally. It pa&s;&s;es off gently by the different Excretions, it dilutes the &s;a|line, and corrects the bilious Part of the Blood. Bad Water mu&s;t be inimical to Health, according to the Manner and De|gree in which it happens to be impregnated
<PB N="42" REF="48">with heterogenous Matter. Snow Water, and Water that freezes mo&s;t readily into Ice, are found to be the pure&s;t of all; the next in Purity is Rain Water, which falls in moderate Weather, and then River Wa|ter, which runs with a brisk Current. Spring Water, in pa&s;&s;ing through the Strata of the Earth, often imbibes mineral, and other Ingredients, and accordingly becomes more objectionable: Neverthele&s;s it is com|monly and very properly u&s;ed, becau&s;e it is more readily obtained in a pure State, than any of the former generally are. The pu|re&s;t Water is that which has neither Ta&s;te, Colour, nor Smell; that which is lighte&s;t and mo&s;t limpid; that which ea&s;ily lathers with Soap: and that which does not effer|ve&s;ce or bubble, nor form any Sediment when good Vinegar, or Spirits of Sal Ammo|niac is put into it. The mo&s;t certain Me|thod of purifying Water is by Di&s;tillation, and the mo&s;t commodious and ea&s;y, is by boiling. The Influence of Fire de&s;troys Animalculae, and by diffu&s;ing the compo|nent Parts of Water, it affords an Oppor|tunity
<PB N="43" REF="49">for the fixed Air, and the too volatile Particles to evaporate, and by the &s;ame Means, decompo&s;es the Combinations, &s;o that the earthy and foreign Ingredients fall to the Bottom. Filtration, the Mixture of Chalk or Sand, Expo&s;ure to the open Air, and allowing it due Time to &s;ettle, are, indi|vidually, conducive towards the Purification of Water.</P>
<P>The Influence of the Moon, in her differ|ent Pha&s;es, upon the Earth, is a Matter well known: And authentic Ob&s;ervations &s;eem to confirm the Opinion, that Commotions in the Animal Sy&s;tem, and the Attack of febrile, epileptic, and other Di&s;ea&s;es, as well as periodical Alterations, are, in a certain Degree, coincident with the Returns of the new, and full Moon. For my own Part, although I have no Doubt about the Cer|tainty of this Doctrine; yet my own Ob&s;er|vations have not been &s;o accurate on this Point, as to e&s;tabli&s;h any invariable Rules which I could pre&s;ume to offer as a Guide.</P>

<P>A Pendulum of any Kind, &s;u&s;pended in &s;uch a Manner as to receive no other Motion except that conveyed to it by the Pul&s;ation of &s;ome of the large Arteries of a Per&s;on in Health, makes a certain Number of &s;trong|er Vibrations than ordinary, corre&s;ponding to the Hour of the Day. If the Po&s;ition be true, (which I have often proved, by re&s;t|ing the Right Arm over a Cup, or common Beer Gla&s;s, holding one End of a Piece of Thread, between the Thumb and Finger, with a Ring, or &s;uch like fa&s;tened to the other End, which reached towards the Center of the Cavity) the Inference mu&s;t be, that there is a certain Number of extra|ordinary Pul&s;ations in the Arterial Sy&s;tem, within the Space of every Hour, varying with the Sun's Di&s;tance from the Meridian. This Experiment I only mention as de|&s;erving further Inve&s;tigation, as it might lead to the Di&s;covery of tho&s;e Periods when the Paroxy&s;ms of Fevers, &amp;c. may be ex|pected; and thus a&s;certain the mo&s;t proper Time for the Exhibition of Medicines.</P>

<P>I have known In In&s;tances where Mu&s;ic af|forded effectual Relief in the mo&s;t violent Pain; and believe that its Powers might be &s;o managed as to be &s;erviceable in &s;ome acute, and nervous Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>No virulent, infectious, or contagious Di&s;ea&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly be communicated but by Means of &s;ome of the morbific Particles coming in Contact with, and finding Ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the Body, which mu&s;t al&s;o be, at the &s;ame Time, in a State adapted for the Reception, and Nouri&s;hment or A&s;&s;i|mulation of the invading Particles.</P>
<P>Therefore the general Plan of Defence again&s;t every Species of Infection mu&s;t be, to avoid the Contact of its Effluvia, or to repel and di&s;&s;ipate them, when in Contact.</P>
<P>In the Lues Venerea, and Itch, where the infectious Matter is palpably depo&s;ited, wa&s;hing and clean&s;ing the Parts will often de&s;troy the Infection.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="52">
<P>In all infectious Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as the Small Pox, Mea&s;les, putrid, pe&s;tilential, and epidemic Fevers, the Air is the Medi|dium, (except when they are communicat|ed by Means of infected Clothes, and &s;uch like,) and con&s;equently the Skin, and the internal Surface of the Mouth, No&s;e, Lungs, and Stomach, are the Points of Contact, and all the&s;e Parts have Pores of Admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Method then, in the&s;e Ca&s;es, will be to chew aromatic and pungent Sub|&s;tances in the Mouth, to impregnate the ambient Air with volatile and correcting Particles, and to brace the Stomach with &s;uch Things as are &s;timulating and anti|&s;ceptic.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every Year, and often at different Sea&s;ons of the &s;ame Year, there happen pre|vailing Fevers, which are very perplexing to the Relatives of &s;uch as labour under them. The natural Duties of Humanity con&s;train their Attendance, their Appre hen&s;ions of Danger to them&s;elves and Fa|milies excite their Solicitude, and the An|&s;wers
<PB N="47" REF="53">given by the attending Faculty to their anxious Enquiries whether or not the Di&s;|ea&s;e be infectious, are &s;eldom &s;atisfactory, and perhaps not always quite judicious.</P>
<P>Let me then, in Regard of this Matter, ob&s;erve, in few Words, that almo&s;t all the Fevers that occur between the Months of April and November, if they do not pro|ceed from what is termed catching Cold; if they be not regular intermittent; if they &s;eem different from any of the known Cla&s;s of common Fevers; and if they be attended with peculiar Symptoms, &s;uch as an extra|ordinary quick Pul&s;e, extreme Debility, ex|ce&s;&s;ive Sickne&s;s at Stomach, violent Pain in the Head, Sleepine&s;s, Deafne&s;s, and Deli|rium; if Circum&s;tances and Appearances be &s;uch, I &s;ay, there is too much Rea&s;on to believe that the Fevers in Que&s;tion are, more or le&s;s, of an infectious and epidemic Kind. Indeed, it is to be remembered, that morbid Effluvium of any Sort, whether infectious or not, when it comes in Con|tact frequently, and in con&s;iderable Quanti|ties, always carries Danger with it. It
<PB N="48" REF="54">has a procreative Power, or Power of gene|rating &s;omething &s;imilar to it&s;elf. No Won|der then, that tho&s;e who are much expo&s;ed to the Breath and Per&s;piration of di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons &s;hould lo&s;e their Health: neither is it &s;trange that tho&s;e Fevers, which have ju&s;t been de&s;cribed, &s;hould &s;pread gradually from one Individual, and from one Family to another.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the principal Cau&s;es already enu|merated, there are many others which af|fect Health and occa&s;ion Di&s;ea&s;es. All the different Situations and Employments in Life, e&s;pecially of the mechanical Kind, are, more or le&s;s, productive of Di&s;ea&s;es pe|culiar to the Nature and Circum&s;tances of each. But as the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e would exceed my Plan, and perhaps be more te|dious than de&s;irable, I &s;hall &s;atisfy my&s;elf with adding &s;ome promi&s;cuous Ob&s;erva|tions on the Animal Oeconomy.</P>
<P>The Laxity of the Fibres and the Quick|ne&s;s of the Circulation in Children, render
<PB N="49" REF="55">them extremely &s;u&s;ceptible of Irritation and Di&s;order from whatever is heating, or &s;ti|mulating. The chief Bu&s;ine&s;s therefore mu&s;t be to keep them cool and ea&s;y. They &s;hould undergo (tho&s;e e&s;pecially who are weak or ricketty) the Cold-Bath, be ex|po&s;ed to the open Air, and live upon a light, cool Diet. How pernicious then, mu&s;t it be to habituate them to &s;pirituous Liquors, which is too frequently offered to Child|ren, and to pamper them with whatever their Fancy prompts them to a&s;k!</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on the human Sy&s;|tem in all Ca&s;es, has the greate&s;t Effect, and the more it has been accu&s;tomed to Impre&s;&s;ions of every Kind, the le&s;s liable will it be to Agitation and Di&s;order, in future. The Advantage then, of carrying Children through the Small-Pox, Mea&s;les, and all the other infectious and endemical Di&s;ea&s;es which await them, as early as po&s;&s;ible, cannot but appear evident. They undergo the&s;e Complaints with le&s;s Danger before their Fluids are contaminated, and
<PB N="50" REF="56">al&s;o become le&s;s &s;ubject to the Attack of other accidental Di&s;orders, in Con&s;equence of their Habit being rather meliorated, and their Con&s;titution, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, con|firmed by Emorbification, or the Abatement of morbid Tendency.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t juvenile Sen&s;ations be &s;o im|pre&s;&s;ive, of what infinite Importance mu&s;t not prudent and judicious Management be, towards forming the Temper, in&s;piring the Genius, bending the Propen&s;ities, and directing the tender impul&s;ive Movements, during the &s;oft, flexible Period of dawning Years! It is true, the Miniature of the Frame is modelled by the Proce&s;s of Na|ture, and receives the Texture, Lines and Proportion, which particularize it, from the &s;ame original Hand. This Ba&s;is or Ground Work, it mu&s;t ever be impo&s;&s;ible to alter, with Regard to its fir&s;t Principles of Struc|ture and Organization. Neverthele&s;s, the ductile Fibres are ea&s;ily capable of In|flexion and Modulation, therefore the brighte&s;t Springs of the Sy&s;tem may be
<PB N="51" REF="57">moved, cheri&s;hed and augmented, and al&s;o the Exuberancy and Di&s;proportion of Parts &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, fa&s;hioned and amended. I do not conceive, that the Rudiments of a Fool can be refined into the Lu&s;tre of a Philo|&s;opher, nor that the natural Endowments of Parts and Abilities can be deba&s;ed and adulterated down to the Level of the mo&s;t common Materials, or the meane&s;t Capa|city, but I am very certain that much Good, or Harm, may be done to the tender Plant of human Life, when it fir&s;t begins to vegetate.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Path of Inve&s;tigation may be traced the Laws of Phy&s;iognomy, &s;o far as they concord with &s;olid Rea&s;on, and the Te&s;t of phy&s;ical Knowledge.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficiently evident to common Un|der&s;tanding, that the Shape of the Head, of indeed every Animal, corre&s;ponds with the Nature of the Intellect. Hence it mu&s;t follow, that a certain Conformation, Pro|portion or Exten&s;ion of Parts or Lines (as
<PB N="52" REF="58">well as Texture and Principles) is indi&s;pen|&s;ibly requi&s;ite for the Performance of the Faculty of Perception, and the &s;everal pro|gre&s;&s;ive and combined Operations that ari&s;e from it. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on it is, that a &s;quare, or angular Form of the Brain will not an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e, and that a circular or globular Figure is, con&s;equently, nece&s;|&s;ary. The Face and Head are the princi|pal Phy&s;iognomical Parts, as they imme|diately &s;hew the true Mould and Mea&s;ure which circum&s;cribe the prime Movement, or the Brain.</P>
<P>A flat Face or Features, mo&s;t probably, will not admit, or carry on a Motion in the Mind competently full and di&s;tinct, this therefore, may be the Indication of Defici|ency or Weakne&s;s of Intellect. Pointed, prominent, and acute Lines, may, no Doubt, portend Exce&s;s, Depth, and Nar|rowne&s;s of intellectual Motion; accordingly Ferocity and Ob&s;tinacy may re&s;ult from the former, Cunning and Sagacity from the next, and Malevolence and Peevi&s;hne&s;s from the latter.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="59">
<P>Elevation of Lines may be&s;peak Pride, and Ira&s;cibility; and Depre&s;&s;ion may intimate Inequality or Ficklene&s;s of Temper. Pro|tuberance of Lines, I would al&s;o hope, may indicate an Extent of Talents, and Depth of Judgment, as well as Strength of Impul&s;e, and Propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>It is further obvious enough that the Faculties of the Mind cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s a full Perfection and Congruity of Powers, unle&s;s there be a concomitant Proportion and Symmetry in the corporal Organs. There|fore, any great Inequality or Irregularity of external Parts mu&s;t, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, di|mini&s;h the Uniformity and Harmony of the Whole. It mu&s;t cramp and confine the Con|cordance of Motion, if the Di&s;parity of Parts be defective, and render the Move|ment awkward and ungraceful, if the Di&s;|parity be &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o ob&s;erved a Conformity and Alliance between different Parts of the Body, con&s;iderably di&s;tant from one another,
<PB N="54" REF="60">con&s;equently the different Parts mu&s;t originally be proportioned, to each other, and likewi&s;e, to the Whole. But it is cha|ritable to believe, at the &s;ame Time, that a happy, internal Compages may, &s;ome|times, take Place, and counterbalance the Di&s;advantages of unfavourable outward Signs.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, all the&s;e Congruities and Di&s;parities mu&s;t often be variable and falla|cious, if it were for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e Magnitude and Energy are not al|ways, tho' generally, corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>Thus, Phy&s;iognomical Relation may be marked, and carried to a con&s;iderable Ex|tent, with tolerable Preci&s;ion: But if one Fancy be built upon another, which has nothing better than Fancy to &s;upport it, the airy Phantom may be rai&s;ed to a prodi|gious Height, and the Bubble &s;u&s;pended, till, at la&s;t, it bur&s;t, invi&s;ible, in the ro|mantic Wilds of metaphy&s;ical Delu&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="61">
<P>The Female Con&s;titution, being of a more delicate Conformation, and having a finer Texture of Nerves than the other Sex, gives Women a Quickne&s;s of Sen&s;ibility, and great Promptitude of Expre&s;&s;ion; it &s;oftens their Manners, refines their Ideas, and produces a lively Sen&s;ation of Plea&s;ure and Pain. But while they enjoy the&s;e Ad|vantages, and are de&s;ervedly Objects of Affection and E&s;teem, the Softne&s;s, and peculiar Con&s;truction of their Frame &s;ub|ject them to many painful and critical Vi|ci&s;&s;itudes, which, as they affect both their Health and Temper, fully entitle them to all po&s;&s;ible Lenity and Indulgence.</P>
<P>When the important Period of Men|&s;truation arrives, much depends upon proper Management. A &s;edentary Life, Re&s;traint, and Confinement, about that Time, are very unfavourable, while mo|derate Exerci&s;e, the open Air, chearful Society, and Indulgence are highly requi|&s;ite. Hard Work, and Expo&s;ure to much Cold, and to damp Air, are too dangerous
<PB N="56" REF="62">to be hazarded, even among the poore&s;t People.</P>
<P>Equal Care, and &s;imilar Means mu&s;t be employed, towards that critical Time of Life, when the Tide of Circulation begins to ebb. The more &s;lowly and gradually this &s;alutary Evacuation is dimini&s;hed, the le&s;s is the Con&s;titution expo&s;ed to Di&s;|order, on its final Termination. It is, therefore, always advi&s;eable (unle&s;s it be in &s;ome relaxed Habits, where the Di&s;|charge has been too copious) to take due Pains and proper Steps to prolong its Con|tinuance, and thus &s;ecure the Sy&s;tem from the bad Con&s;equences of an abrupt and ha&s;ty Departure.</P>
<P>It is a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation that tho&s;e, who grow up very fa&s;t, are generally &s;ickly, and &s;eldom live to a great Age. The Prime of their Life draws very &s;oon towards the Verge of Declen&s;ion, which Stage, like their Youth, is equally rapid in its Progre&s;s. The Ca&s;e is this. Quick Growth draws
<PB N="57" REF="63">out and elongates the Fibres and Ve&s;&s;els to a greater Exten&s;ion than the gradual In|crea&s;e of the vital Powers can nouri&s;h and &s;upport; hence the Con&s;titution becomes weakly and relaxed. This Error, in the Procedure of Nature, &s;hould be remedied, if practicable, by the Cold Bath, and tonic Medicines.</P>
<P>The premature Indulgence of amorous De&s;ires, in the early Bloom of Youth, is productive of the mo&s;t ruinous Con&s;e|quences. At this Period, the Mind grows warm and well adapted to imbibe a proper Fund and Connexion of Ideas, through the favourable Di&s;po&s;ition of the Nerves; and the Body begins to germinate and gather Firmne&s;s and Vigour from the Matura|tion of its Juices, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Glands, which now unfold and afford a Repo&s;itory, for the lymphatic and nutri|tious Part of the Fluids, to an&s;wer the Emergencies of Nature. But the un&s;ea|&s;onable Pur&s;uit of unripe Enjoyment bla&s;ts the&s;e promi&s;ing Fruits, draws off Health,
<PB N="58" REF="64">and Genius from the Sy&s;tem, through the Channel of Plea&s;ure, and inevitably &s;hortens Life.</P>
<P>When the Con&s;titution approaches its Zenith or confirmed State, if the &s;ocial Impul&s;e occa&s;ion Di&s;order, and reject Con|trol, its Effects are too important to be neglected, as they often have the greate&s;t Influence upon the whole Frame. An ex|qui&s;ite Sen&s;ibility in the Nervous Sy&s;tem united with &s;ufficient Powers in the Cir|culation, on the one Hand, and a full, and cold phlegmatic Con&s;titution, on the other, are the two Extremes of Temperament which particularly require Indulgence; the former, in Order to dimini&s;h that Plenitude and Irritation, which (if not re|moved) might produce Frenzy, Fevers, Inflammations, &amp;c. and the latter, on Purpo&s;e to create that Excitement and Action in the Nerves and Ve&s;&s;els, which are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Ob&s;tructions, Con|&s;umptions, Hypocondria, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="65">
<P>Continued Celibacy generally loads the Glands, retards the Circulation, and oc|ca&s;ions Fulne&s;s and Stagnation in the Ve&s;&s;els. In this State, the Mind, unex|panded by the &s;oft Fire of mutual Rap|ture, often becomes gloomy, &s;elfi&s;h, and contracted, and all its Faculties, being confined within the narrow Compa&s;s of ordinary Gratifications, are devoted to Habits of par&s;imonious Care, and con|templative Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Temperance is the be&s;t Pledge for Longevity, neverthele&s;s, young People &s;hould, by all Means, inure them&s;elves to the Hard&s;hips and A&s;perities of Life.

<P>Little Irregularities may, now and then, be committed with Impunity, per|haps
<PB N="60" REF="66">with Benefit, but frequent Shocks of Revelry and Debauch over&s;train the Sy&s;tem, indurate the Solids, block up the fine vital Channels, and ha&s;ten the Approach of rigid old Age.</P>
<P>The Animal Machine, from the Na|ture of its Organization, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a Power of regulating it&s;elf, and is con&s;tantly ex|erci&s;ing this Power; therefore all Di&s;ea&s;es, if fully under&s;tood, are curable in the Beginning. The mo&s;t robu&s;t Constitu|tion cannot, at all Times, be equally healthy, but is rather in a State of con|tinual Variation; and when the Efforts of Nature are inadequate to the Purpo&s;e of Regulation, Di&s;order, in a correspond|ing Degree, mu&s;t en&s;ue. Nature, then, re&s;i&s;ts every Species of Di&s;ea&s;e; and it is at tho&s;e Times, when the Nervous Sy&s;|tem is relaxed and exhau&s;ted by Heat, Fatigue, Watching, Exce&s;s, &amp;c. or irri|tated by any of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, that the Body is particularly &s;u&s;ceptible of the Cau&s;e of Di&s;ea&s;es. Fear and Dread of
<PB N="61" REF="67">any infectious Di&s;temper, accordingly, ne|ver fail to render a Per&s;on more liable to receive it.</P>
<P>In incipient, as well as in confirmed Di&s;ea&s;es, the Calls of Nature &s;hould be a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly watched and regarded, &s;ince her Dictates and Indications are hardly ever er|roneous or improper, whether they point to Warmth, Coolne&s;s, Sleep, Excitement, Ab&s;tinence, Nouri&s;hment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Any Part of the Sy&s;tem, that is either naturally infirm, or has &s;uffered any Kind of Injury, is always mo&s;t liable to the Inva&s;ion of Di&s;ea&s;e and Pain, and &s;hould, on that Account, be more particularly guarded and defended.</P>
<P>The Approach of all febrile Di&s;ea&s;es is marked with &s;ome extraordinary Agitation in the Sy&s;tem. Languor, Lo&s;s of Strength, flying Pains, hideous Dreams, &amp;c. indicate &s;omewhat morbid acting on the Nerves; but if the&s;e be attended with Nau&s;ea at
<PB N="62" REF="68">the Stomach, Chills, and alternate Glows, or Sweats, &s;ome acute Malady is much to be apprehended. Indeed Chills, (except after Meals and Evacuations) as they come by a Con&s;triction of the Skin, and a general Spa&s;m through the Sy&s;tem, from Debility, or Irritation, always import &s;ome Degree of Danger. From the&s;e Symp|toms of acute Di&s;ea&s;es, Caution ought to take the Alarm, and as it is ever ea&s;ier to prevent than cure, it would be mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable to arm and oppo&s;e their fir&s;t Ad|vances.</P>
<P>The Habit is that State of Body peculiar to each, and, according as it varies from the Standard of Health, is, in an equal Mea&s;ure, &s;ubject to Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;trong and full Habit, (which is ge|nerally indicated by a full and hard Pul&s;e) in which the Quantity of Blood and Force of Circulation are greater than ordinary, though it has a Tendency towards inflam|matory Complaints, is &s;till infinitely le&s;s
<PB N="63" REF="69">dangerous than the oppo&s;ite Extreme, where the Habit is relaxed, and all the vital Powers languid and imperfect. Under &s;uch Circum&s;tances the Body is open to all the Train of nervous Di&s;orders, to Ob|&s;tructions, Drop&s;y and Scurvy, and expo&s;|ed to the Attack of intermittent, nervous, bilious and putrid Fevers: and if there be a &s;uperfluous Quantity of half &s;tagnant, in active Fluids in the Sy&s;tem, at the &s;ame Time, the Danger is, in all Re&s;pects, augmented by it.</P>
<P>A fat and gro&s;s Habit is always nearly allied to Di&s;ea&s;e. The contrary, or rather the middle Temperament, is, by far the mo&s;t healthy: It &s;hews that the Offices of Dige&s;tion, Circulation and Secretion are regular and effective.</P>
<P>If the common Exerci&s;es of Life, the Cold Bath, and moderate Living will not prevent, nor reduce Corpulency, it would be better to try the Help of Medicine, than be obliged to carry about &s;o unplea&s;ant a Burthen as &s;ome People do.</P>

<P>It may not be improper here to give a Caution again&s;t frequent and unnece&s;&s;ary Blood-letting, as being a very ab&s;urd and pernicious Practice.

I have ob&s;erved it as an almo&s;t invariable Rule, that all Percep|tions, whether of a plea&s;ing or painful Nature, return pretty exactly at &s;tated, or equal Intervals; I mean that Anxiety, De|&s;ire, Fancy, Levity and Pen&s;ivene&s;s, as well as Sleep, Hunger, and the other
<PB N="65" REF="71">common Solicitations of Nature, make their Approaches nearly about the &s;ame Time that they have been u&s;ually gratified and indulged.</P>
<P>Now as the Influence of &s;uch Perceptions mu&s;t operate on the mental Faculties, in the Way of Coincidence and Recollection, and on the corporal Organs, agreeable to the Laws of the Sy&s;tem, it mu&s;t follow, that the &s;ure&s;t Method (when Re&s;olution is inadequate to the Ta&s;k) to &s;ubdue any Habit, or Cu&s;tom, is to pre&s;ent new Ob|jects to the Mind, and provide different Impre&s;&s;ions for the Body. Yet, however proper this Remedy may be, it mu&s;t be conducted with Di&s;cretion, for Fear it &s;hould imperceptibly degenerate into a Cour&s;e of Di&s;&s;ipation, a mo&s;t pitiable and unhappy Cour&s;e, in which, the re&s;tle&s;s Mind, warm in the Pur&s;uit of new Grati|fication, becomes intoxicated with Plea|&s;ure, and mi&s;&s;ing the Path of rational En|joyment, lo&s;es it&s;elf, inextricable, in a Labyrinth of Folly, Madne&s;s and Vexation.
<PB N="66" REF="72">Wi&s;dom &s;hould ever pre&s;cribe Bounds to De&s;ire, and &s;till keep &s;ome Re&s;ource to &s;atisfy the various Wants of feeble old Age. If Youth and Maturity be &s;pent in Exce&s;s and Di&s;&s;ipation, if all the riche&s;t Stores of human Bli&s;s be lavi&s;hly and pre|maturely exhau&s;ted, and the Con&s;titution &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tered in the wild Career, what new Expedients can be devi&s;ed, what po&s;&s;ible Means can be found to prop the tottering Fabric, or chear the dull Winter of declin|ing Years.</P>
<P>The Regularity and Proportion, which is e&s;&s;ential to Health, will not &s;uffer much Deviation, in any Re&s;pect, from the Track of e&s;tabli&s;hed Cu&s;tom. Hence a Diminu|tion, or Alteration in any of the common and habitual Evacuations, Secretions, or even Perceptions, changes the Equilibrium of the Sy&s;tem, and very materially affects the Health and Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>When Di&s;order is the Re&s;ult of &s;uch Circum&s;tances, the Ballance mu&s;t be re|&s;tored,
<PB N="67" REF="73">by promoting the Excretions which are retarded, or have cea&s;ed; by inviting the defective Circulation to the Parts which it has de&s;erted, or towards the Extremities, in general, by Means of Warmth, Friction, Exerci&s;e, or Fomentation; and by renew|ing tho&s;e Sen&s;ations and Incentives, which the Nerves &s;tand in Need of, to increa&s;e their Energy, and to give free Scope and previous Impul&s;e to their nice, progre&s;&s;ive Motions.</P>
<P>But when the cu&s;tomary Evacuations and Emotions cannot be exactly re&s;tored, they &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted by others as &s;imilar in their Nature and Effects as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Nerves being the Medium of Com|munication between the different Parts of the Body, tho&s;e Parts, which po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t Nervo&s;ity or Sen&s;ibility, as the Head, Lungs, Stomach, Womb, and the Skin, have the clo&s;e&s;t Connexion and Sympathy with each other.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="74">
<P>Tho&s;e, therefore, who labour under nervous and hy&s;teric Affections, &s;hould carefully avoid whatever produces di&s;agree|able Impre&s;&s;ions on the Mind, and every Kind of Irritation that may occa&s;ion un|plea&s;ant Sen&s;ations on any of the&s;e &s;u&s;cep|tible Organs, and &s;hould particularly re|frain from flatulent and indige&s;tible Food.</P>
<P>Intellectual Sympathy is one of the mo&s;t refined Emotions of the human Mind. It originates in &s;ome &s;triking Congruity and mutual Harmony, and is excited by fine concording Impre&s;&s;ions made by &s;ome Ob|ject which creates Partiality and E&s;teem, and is only perfect, when accompanied with an Idea that the attractive Impre&s;&s;ion is re|ciprocal. This &s;ympathetic Endowment ever de&s;erves Cultivation and Improvement. It renders one capable of all the Enjoy|ments of &s;incere Friend&s;hip, and can give and receive Con&s;olation in the Hour of Anxiety and of Pain.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="75">
<P>Antipathy proceeds from &s;omething that &s;hocks the Imagination, or offends the Sen&s;es: and when this happens to take Place in the tender Years of Infancy, and the Impre&s;&s;ion has been forcibly received, the Antipathy frequently continues through Life. Such Antipathies are extremely un|plea&s;ant, and, I &s;hould think, might be corrected by gradually familiarizing the offending Cau&s;e, but if the antipathetic Matter affect the Sen&s;e of Smell, it will probably be more difficult to reconcile it.</P>
<P>Antipathy furni&s;hes an Exception to the general Law of the Sy&s;tem, which, it was &s;tated, did always receive &s;econdary Im|pre&s;&s;ions with le&s;s Effect than primary ones. It is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to remark that when Anger, Terror, violent Fevers, deep Intoxication, or any other Cau&s;e, have once thrown the Sy&s;tem into vehement and ex|ce&s;&s;ive Agitations, (whereby the Nerves are irrecoverably &s;trained) the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame Cau&s;e, in but a very &s;mall Degree, will produce &s;imilar Effects, in the highe&s;t
<PB N="70" REF="76">Degree: and the&s;e Effects will more ea&s;ily take Place, in Proportion to the Frequency and Repetition of the impelling Cau&s;e. From which Con&s;ideration may be per|ceived the Nece&s;&s;ity of guarding again&s;t all violent Shocks, and of obviating their Con|&s;equences, as &s;oon and effectually as po&s;&s;i|ble. Children, and People of weak Nerves and delicate Con&s;titutions &s;hould be parti|cularly careful in this Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Nervous and hy&s;teric Complaints, faint|ing Fits, Convul&s;ions, Madne&s;s and &s;uch like frequently &s;pring from this Source, and in Time, become fixed, habitually, or periodically.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Advice mu&s;t al&s;o be extended to pregnant Women, who&s;e Imagination, or Pa&s;&s;ions, when violently excited, &s;ometimes, mark and injure the Foetus. There are &s;o many incontrovertible Proofs of this Kind of Influence, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to doubt the Certainty of it: which appears to me nowi&s;e que&s;tionable, &s;ince I can &s;ee no
<PB N="71" REF="77">Difficulty to account for it, in a clear and rational Manner.</P>
<P>Imitation is a very operative Faculty in the Animal Sy&s;tem. It is a natural and &s;pontaneous Action, whereby, without Volition, or even Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, one Per|&s;on imitates and re&s;embles the Motions, Ge&s;tures, or Perceptions of another. Si|lence, &s;inging, coughing, Laughter, &s;peak|ing, &s;inging, walking and Credulity which communicate, and pa&s;s from one Per&s;on to another, like Electricity, are obvious Proofs that Similitude, or the imitative Faculty, is one of the primary, leading Motions in the human Mind, and bring no &s;mall Evidence in Confirmation of what has been already &s;aid on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Stammering, and other bad Habits, and even Convul&s;ions may be contracted from this Cau&s;e. Which Con&s;ideration &s;ugge&s;ts a Caution &s;ufficient to induce People to pay due Regard to &s;uch Companions and Ob|jects as are &s;uffered to have Intercour&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="78">with Children, and Per&s;ons in a weak, nervous and irritable State.</P>
<P>Imagination is the Exerci&s;e of primary Perception, or Perception of the fir&s;t Forms and Colours, in which Images &s;trike the Mind, unaccompanied with, and con&s;e|quently unaltered by the deliberative or rea&s;oning Operations. Imagination, there|fore, con&s;iders Objects in the Light they fir&s;t appear, which Appearance does not always corre&s;pond with Intrin&s;icne&s;s or Reality; though very frequently the fir&s;t View of the Mind is as accurate and com|prehen&s;ive as &s;everal Reviews or Compa|ri&s;ons are. When Memory or uncom|pounded Reflection repre&s;ents Images to the Mind, the&s;e Images ari&s;e merely from the Power of Recollection, which is only the Operation of the fir&s;t Cla&s;s of Similitudes: but Images, which proceed from Judgment, are fa&s;hioned with all the Rays and Shades of nice and minute Analogy; and the&s;e are often created without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Memory. Hence Ver&s;atility or Quickne&s;s
<PB N="73" REF="79">of Imagination is often found to be a &s;uper|ficial Quality, and on a Level only with the Depth of Memory. But if a warm and teeming Imagination be united with Solidity of Judgment, and profound Pene|tration, it be&s;peaks the happie&s;t and noble&s;t Compo&s;ition of the human Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>The Mind is exceedingly &s;u&s;ceptible of the two oppo&s;ite Perceptions, Hope and Fear. They are the quick-born Offspring of Imagination, begotten by the Idea of Plea&s;ure, or Pain, who&s;e Familiarity and Intimacy always afford them ea&s;y Acce&s;s to her Embraces.</P>
<P>It will then manife&s;tly appear that the Influence of Imagination, &s;o far as regards the Cau&s;e and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, is nothing but the Effect of Hope, or Fear. But the&s;e Effects have been already explained in treating of the Pa&s;&s;ions. It mu&s;t, there|fore, be obvious whence a healthy Man may be frightened into a Fever, and a dying Per&s;on, in a Manner, quickened into
<PB N="74" REF="80">Life, by the In&s;tillation and Continuation of either of the&s;e Influences upon the Mind. Hence the Effect of Animal Mag|neti&s;m, and of No&s;trums, Charms and En|chantments, in &s;ometimes curing Agues, Fits and other Di&s;orders, which, in Truth, have no Value nor Utility but what they derive from this Source.</P>
<P>Volition, or the Will, Purpo&s;e, or De|&s;ign, is either intentional, or actual; that is, De&s;ign intended, or De&s;ign executed. Of which neither the one nor the other is in&s;tantaneous, or immediately perform|ed; they require both of them &s;everal of the progre&s;&s;ive Operations of the Mind. For no Man ever had an Inclination or Will to do an Act, before he had fir&s;t rea&s;oned upon it, and con&s;idered the End or Purport of &s;uch an Act. The Mind cannot p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ibly direct the Nervous Influence into the right Arm, in Preference to the left, (except in the common and habitual Motions of Walking and Ge&s;ticulation) till it has fir&s;t poi&s;ed it&s;elf or deliberated, and
<PB N="75" REF="81">then it can give the voluntary Impul&s;e. Hence it is manife&s;t beyond Contradiction, that every Per&s;on, of a &s;ound State of Body, is ab&s;olutely a free Agent, and may either commit, or not commit any particular Act. But &s;till the Exerci&s;e of Common Sen&s;e mu&s;t be pre&s;ent in Order to con&s;titute Crimi|nality. If a Per&s;on err from Pa&s;&s;ion, it is Madne&s;s, if from Ignorance, or wrong Ideas, it is Mi&s;take, Both Ca&s;es, are entitled to Alleviation and Compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;hould be weighed in the Scales of Humanity, with the fair Ballance of Candour, placed in the Medium of Excitement, to a&s;certain the intrin&s;ic Quality, and compute the true Degree of Right, or Wrong.</P>
