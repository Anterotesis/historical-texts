<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> or <HI>Jail Fever</HI> is already well known, and has been correctly and minutely de|&s;cribed by &s;everal writers upon the &s;ubject; I &s;hould not have thought my&s;elf authorized to ob|trude this account upon the public attention, had not the treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e, which was adopted and &s;ucce&s;sfully pur&s;ued at Carli&s;le, ap|peared to differ in &s;ome circum&s;tances from what has hitherto obtained in general practice. This difference con&s;i&s;ts principally in the more <HI>early</HI> application, and in the much <HI>freer</HI> u&s;e of <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Port Wine.</HI> A caution &s;eems to have been &s;crupulou&s;ly adhered to, of not admini&s;tering the&s;e remedies until the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e; by which delay the &s;trength of the patient has often been &s;o totally reduced, that all applications of the mo&s;t tonic, &s;timulating, and corroborating medicines have &s;ailed of effect. With re&s;pect to the <HI>quantity</HI> of <HI>Wine,</HI> whereas Sir John Pringle never directed more than a bottle in the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">day, and rarely &s;o much, we have here pre|&s;cribed from one bottle to two bottles and an half daily, always with advantage, and without any ob&s;ervable inconveniency from exce&s;s. The do&s;es al&s;o of the <HI>Bark</HI> are nearly double to tho&s;e which the &s;ame eminent Phy&s;ician u&s;ually exhibited.</P>
<P>If the medical reader be taught by this ac|count to &s;u&s;pect the re&s;erve with which he has proceeded in the u&s;e of <HI>Bark</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> to be unnece&s;&s;ary and hurtful&mdash;if further enquiry and experience encourage him in a more liberal ap|plication of the&s;e valuable <HI>tonics</HI> and <HI>&s;timu|lants</HI>&mdash;and if the lives of any of our fellow-crea|tures be thereby pre&s;erved, the publication of the&s;e papers will have fulfilled every intention of their author.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>Of the</HI> History <HI>and</HI> Symptoms <HI>of this</HI> FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of <HI>April</HI> an epidemic Fever began to make its appearance in <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and continued to rage with more or le&s;s violence during the remaining part of the year.</P>
<P>The ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and decline of this epi|demic will be be&s;t a&s;certained by examining the regi&s;ter of deaths, where I find that <HI>two</HI> fell victims to it, in the month of <HI>May; four</HI> in <HI>June; four</HI> in <HI>July; eight</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t; &s;even</HI> in <HI>September; nine</HI> in <HI>October; eight</HI> in
<PB N="3" REF="6"><HI>November;</HI> and <HI>&s;ix in December;</HI> in all <HI>fifty two,</HI> including a &s;oldier of the fir&s;t regi|ment of Dragoons, and three married wo|men from the villages of <HI>Rockliffe</HI> and <HI>War|wick.</HI> Of this number, <HI>three</HI> were <HI>boys; three</HI> were <HI>bachelors; fifteen</HI> were <HI>hu&s;bands; three</HI> were <HI>girls; two</HI> were <HI>maids; twenty one</HI> were <HI>wives;</HI> and <HI>five</HI> were <HI>widows;</HI> &s;o that above two thirds of tho&s;e who died were married people,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In January 1780 there were 6299 inhabitants in Carli&s;le, of the&s;e 1019 were hu&s;bands; 1091 were wives; 91 were widowers; 408 were widows; and the remainder were either children, bachelors, or maids. Since that time there has been &s;ome increa&s;e, which however is not a&s;certained, but which cannot be very con&s;iderable.</NOTE> a circum&s;tance, the cau&s;e of which, I perhaps may at &s;ome future opportunity en|deavour to inve&s;tigate, at pre&s;ent I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf with barely mentioning the fact.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<P>During the winter, we had no fro&s;t of any long duration, but the cold was, con&s;idering the climate, &s;ometimes very inten&s;e. The &s;pring, upon the whole, was mild and tem|perate. In May, June, and July, the wea|ther was remarkably warm, dry, and &s;erene; and continued &s;o till about the middle of Augu&s;t, when the temperature of the air &s;uddenly changed, and we had ten days or a fortnight of cold wet weather. In Septem|ber, the air was warm and moi&s;t; in October, it was remarkably temperate and dry. November commenced with a &s;mart fro&s;tt, which however, continued but two days; the re&s;t; of the month (the 22d and 23d days excepted which were fro&s;t) was con&s;tantly wet, blowing weather. Till the 13th of december, the air was remarkably dry, even to &s;uch a degree as to make the roads du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly; afterwards it became moi&s;t, mild, and warm. On chri&s;tmas day I ob&s;erved the <HI>common wild dai&s;y,</HI> (viz. Bellis Perennis)
<PB N="5" REF="8">in full blow. On the 28th there was a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of wind and rain from the we&s;t, which continued for &s;everal hours.</P>
<P>This Fever chiefly, I may almo&s;t &s;ay en|tirely, raged among&s;t the common and lower ranks of people; and more e&s;pecially among&s;t tho&s;e who lived in narrow, clo&s;e, confined lanes, and in &s;mall crowded apartments.</P>
<P>It affected adults more frequently than children,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I never &s;aw any children under three years of age who were affected with it.</NOTE> the infirm, than the robu&s;t, wo|men than men, and the married were more &s;ubject to it than the &s;ingle. The fir&s;t per&s;on &s;eized with it in a family was &s;eldom the la&s;t, for in general more than one, often three or four, and &s;ometimes the whole family were affected with it one after another.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<P>It was in a great mea&s;ure confined to this place, very few being &s;eized with it in the neighbouring villages,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">e time in Augu&s;t, a young man who had re|cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">m this Fever, went home to a &s;mall village call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ckl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ffe, about four miles from Carli&s;le, for the ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">t of fre&s;h air, &amp;c.

<PB N="7" REF="10">
<P>I have endeavoured to a&s;certain the num|ber of per&s;ons who have been &s;eized with this Fever, and, from the be&s;t information I have been able to procure, it appears that near &s;ix hundred have, at this time viz. January the 6th, 1782, been affected with it; that is, about one in eleven or twelve of all the inhabitants of Carli&s;le, and one in ten nearly of all who have been attacked by the di&s;order have died.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars being premi&s;ed, which I think may afterwards be of &s;ome u&s;e to|wards a&s;certaining the exact nature of the epidemic, I &s;hall now endeavour to give a faithful hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e, or a brief and accurate narration of the &s;ymptoms, as they appeared to me at the patients bed&s;ide.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<P>This Fever con&s;tantly begins with a &s;en&s;a|tion of coldne&s;s and &s;hivering, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling the fit of an ague, which however by no means continues &s;o long, or proceeds to &s;uch a violent degree; &s;oon afterwards the patient complains of a pain in his head, and back, and &s;ometimes in other parts of his body; of nau&s;ea and &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, but he &s;eldom vomits; of great la&s;&s;itude, weak|ne&s;s, and wearine&s;s; of dejection of &s;pirits; or heat frequently alternating with the cold &s;hivering fits; of thir&s;t; and lo&s;s of appetite; his &s;leep is al&s;o confu&s;ed and di&s;turbed with frightful dreams.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e is weak and frequent, varying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">om ninety, to a hundred and ten &s;trokes in a minute; the &s;kin in general is dry; the tongue white but rather moi&s;t; the urine is crude and pale, i. e. paler than urine u&s;ual|ly made by a healthy per&s;on; the belly in ge|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ral regular.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<P>In this &s;ituation the patient for the mo&s;t part, continues one, two, or &s;ometimes even three days, not altogether confined to his bed, but if left to him&s;elf getting up and lying down upon the bed &s;everal times in a day.</P>
<P>This I &s;hall denominate the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>According to the moderation or violence of the above &s;ymptoms, the patient is confined entirely to his bed, on the &s;econd, third, or &s;ometimes on the beginning of the fourth day from the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of the cold &s;hivering fit. Almo&s;t all the &s;ymptoms now increa&s;e. The pain of the head becomes acute; the debility is &s;uch, that the patient cannot be rai&s;ed to an erect, or even &s;itting po&s;ture for any length of time, without great danger of bringing on a fainting fit; the appetite is to|tally gone; the thir&s;t increa&s;es; a tremor of
<PB N="10" REF="13">the hands &s;upervenes; the tongue becomes gradually dry, and brown, and when thru&s;t out of the mouth for examination is un|&s;teady and tremulous; the &s;kincontinues dry; the urine pale and without &s;ediment; the pul&s;e becomes more frequent and feeble, viz. from a hundred and ten, to a hundred and fifteen, or even a hundred and twenty &s;trokes in a minute.</P>
<P>The patient talks &s;ome what incoherently, yet knows his friends, and will an&s;wer que&s;|tions with tolerable di&s;tinctne&s;s. In this &s;itua|tion he continues &s;ix, &s;even, eight, nine, ten, or eleven days, and from which, if the &s;ymp|toms do not increa&s;e, he gradually recovers. The acute pain of the head abates; the thir&s;t is more moderate; the urine becomes higher coloured and depo&s;its &s;ome little &s;ediment, the colour and con&s;i&s;tence of which is how|ever various; the pul&s;e gets down gradually to a hundred, ninety, eighty, &amp;c. and be|comes
<PB N="11" REF="14">at the &s;ame time a little fuller and &s;tronger; the patient, tho' he has no great de&s;ire for food, yet is able to take a little when pre&s;ented to him; and la&s;tly, his &s;trength is re&s;tored by &s;low degrees.</P>
<P>The above is the more u&s;ual and favourable appearance and progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e; but often either from neglect or an improper treatment in the beginning, or the patient's bad habit of body it puts on a more fatal and alarming form.</P>
<P>The pain of the head continues; a putrid colliquative loo&s;ene&s;s comes on; the tongue as well as ba&s;e of the teeth are covered with a thick black cru&s;t, and the patient is unable to thru&s;t it out of his mouth, and lo&s;es the power of &s;peech and of &s;wallowing.</P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>petechiae</HI> appear on different parts of the body, and in &s;ome ca&s;es the whole
<PB N="12" REF="15">&s;urface of the body is covered with a &s;carlet offlore&s;cence, which however, &s;oon di&s;appears. The pul&s;e becomes weaker and quicker, from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty &s;trokes in a minute; the patient is now altogethe rin&s;en&s;ible; the urine and faeces are voided without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; he knows not the by-&s;tanders; the delirium is however of the low, not of the furious or outrageous kind.</P>
<P>His mu&s;cles become flaccid; he gathers the bed clothes <HI>(collectio floccorum);</HI> he his affected with <HI>&s;ubfultus tendinum,</HI> convul&s;ive &s;tartings and twitchings of the mu&s;cles of the whole body; he gradually &s;lides towards the foot of the bed; his extremities become cold; a &s;mall quantity of blood &s;ometimes di&s;tills from his no&s;trils; his face has a livid and ca|daverous appearance, and death which &s;oon follows the&s;e &s;ymptoms, puts a period to his &s;ufferings.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<P>After death broad livid blotches appear about the neck and &s;houlders, and putrefac|tion &s;oon takes place.</P>
<P>The appearance of the blood I am unable to de&s;cribe, never having had an opportunity of &s;eeing or examining it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Anomalous Symptoms.</HEAD>
<P>A Diarrhaea &s;ometimes occured in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, but whether it was a &s;ymptom of the general weakne&s;s, or was occa&s;ioned by the bark and other remedies, is uncertain; at all events, if po&s;&s;ible, it was to be checked immediately. In &s;ome ca&s;es the fever was attended with a cough, &s;ometimes with, at other times without ex|pectoration; in other ca&s;es the pul&s;e was by
<PB N="14" REF="17">no means &s;o weak as is above repre&s;ented. A difficulty of making water approaching almo&s;t to a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, with a &s;wel|ling of the abdomen and evident fluctuation, happened in one or two in&s;tances. A re|lap&s;e did not occur to my ob&s;ervation, and if it ever happened, it was very &s;eldom.</P>
<P>Being per&s;uaded of the general truth of the doctrine of critical days, I looked for them in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e with &s;ome attention, but as far as I could ob&s;erve, this Fever had no &s;tated or certain duration; its termina|tions whether in health or in death, by no means happened on certain fixed periods of the di&s;ea&s;e, and were &s;eldom or ever attend|ed with the lea&s;t appearance of a critical di&s;|charge. Patients I believe died on almo&s;t every day of the Fever, from the fifth or &s;ixth, to the &s;ixteenth or &s;eventeenth. The &s;alutary terminations occurred as frequently on the
<PB N="15" REF="18"><HI>non-critical</HI> as on the <HI>critical days,</HI> a favourable change &s;ometimes taking place on the &s;ixth and &s;eventh, often on the eight, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and &s;ixteenth days from the acce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e, and in one ca&s;e no vi&s;ible change for the better took place till the eighteenth day; but liere the patient had not called in advice till the Fever had made con|&s;iderable progre&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, an early or a late, a &s;alutary or a fatal termination of this Fever, entirely de|pended upon the con&s;titution of the patient, and the &s;peedy application of proper remedies. If the patient had a tolerable con&s;titution, and the bark and wine were given in large quantities, immediately after the acce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;oon recovered; If on the contrary, the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines was neg|lected for any length of time, he either died, or was brought to the greate&s;t extremities of
<PB N="16" REF="19">weakne&s;s and danger, from which he recovered exceeding flowly; but concerning the&s;e mat|ters, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more fully in the la&s;t &s;ection.</P>
<P>Having thus related the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptoms of this Fever, I &s;hall now proceed to mention a few particulars re&s;pecting the progno&s;tics.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>Of the</HI> PROGNOSTICS.</HEAD>
<P>ON this head I &s;hall content my&s;elf with pointing out, fir&s;t, tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which indi|cate a favourable i&s;&s;ue; and &s;econdly tho&s;e which on the contrary portend danger and death.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, when the pul&s;e, in the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, does not exceed one hundred and twenty &s;trokes in a minute, and grows &s;lower, and &s;tronger by the u&s;e of <HI>wine</HI> and <HI>bark;</HI> when the urine by the &s;ame remedies
<PB N="18" REF="21">becomes higher coloured, and depo&s;its upon &s;tanding a little time a &s;ediment; when the delirium is not con&s;tant, but only occurs when the patient awakens out of &s;leep; when the pain of the head is not violent, or if it has been violent, upon the u&s;e of the reme|dies hereafter de&s;cribed abates; when the patient is able to lie on his back or &s;ides in|differently; when he is able to put out his tongue, to &s;wallow, and to an&s;wer que&s;tions di&s;tinctly, we may, in general, promi&s;e a favourable termination.</P>
<P>But in the &s;econd place, if the pul&s;e, not|with&s;tanding a liberal and copious u&s;e of <HI>wine</HI> and <HI>bark</HI> is feeble, and exceeds one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty &s;trokes in a minute; if the urine continues crude and pale; if the delirium is con&s;tant; if the loo&s;ene&s;s cannot be re&s;trained by proper re|medies; if the urine and faeces are voided involuntarily; if the teeth are covered with
<PB N="19" REF="22">a black gummy matter; if the tongue is parched, black and chopped; if the patient cannot articulate di&s;tinctly, or &s;wallow, or put out his tongue when de&s;ired; when he can only lie upon his back; when <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendi|num,</HI> tremours of the hands, and convul&s;ive &s;tartings in other parts of the body come on; when he is affected with <HI>&s;tupor;</HI> when he at|tempts to gather up the bed clothes; when his extremities become cold, his face livid, and covered with a cold clammy &s;weat, and he &s;lides down the bed, death is at no great di&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Petechiae</HI> which have by Phy&s;icians been ju&s;tly deemed marks of malignity and putre|faction in fevers of this kind, did not, accord|ing to my ob&s;ervation, portend imminent danger; nor did a bleeding of the no&s;e, unle&s;s occuring together with other dangerous circum&s;tances, appear to me to be an alarming

<P>A Peculiar con&s;titution, or temperament of the air has been often accu&s;ed, and perhaps in &s;ome ca&s;es with propriety, as laying the foundation of many epidemical di&s;orders; accordingly I thought it not improper to mention the &s;tate of the weather, not only pre|vious to the appearance, but during the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and decline of this Fever, altho' I am inclined to think, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, it was by no means a powerful agent.</P>

<P>Becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, this epidemic was in a great mea&s;ure confined to the city and &s;uburbs of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> whereas the general &s;tate of the air mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be nearly the &s;ame through the whole neighbourhood, and more e&s;pecially in the adjacent villages, where, however, no di&s;ea&s;e of the kind ever appeared, unle&s;s the <HI>&s;eeds</HI> of it had been evi|dently carried, either by &s;ome per&s;ons who had laboured under the di&s;ea&s;e, or who&s;e clothes, &amp;c. had been previou&s;ly <HI>imbued</HI> with the contagion.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place becau&s;e the temperature of the air in the months of October and No|vember, (when the Fever raged with the greate&s;t violence) was different from what it had been in April and May, (the months in which the di&s;order began to make its appear|ance) but &s;imilar to what it was in December and January, when it was manife&s;tly upon the decline.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="26">
<P>If we therefore wi&s;h to di&s;cover the cau&s;es, which will be of no little importance in a&s;cer|taining the true and preci&s;e nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, we mu&s;t attend to more local, circum|&s;tances than the general qualities of the air.</P>
<P>It is evident from the preceding hi&s;tory, that this Fever is extremely contagious, i. e. it is evident that a &s;ubtile, active and virulent &s;ub&s;tance is generated in, and e&s;capes from the body of a per&s;on labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e, which, when applied to a &s;ound body, in particular circum&s;tances, will produce a &s;imilar affection; and thus it is propagated from one part of a family to another; and from neigbour to neigbour. This active poi&s;on is by phy&s;icians denominated <HI>Contagion,</HI> or more properly <HI>Human Effluvia.</HI></P>
<P>How this poi&s;on operates on our &s;y&s;tems is not thoroughly under&s;tood, but under what circum&s;tances it is fir&s;t generated and pro|duced,
<PB N="24" REF="27">we are often, but too well acquainted. It is the offspring of filth, na&s;tine&s;s, and con|fined air, in rooms crowded with many inha|bitants. Hence &s;uch <HI>Effluvia</HI> often originates in &s;hips, ho&s;pitals, and jails, of which many &s;triking examples are upon record.</P>
<P>At the a&s;&s;izes held at Oxford in the year 1577, a putrid effluvia ari&s;ing from the pri|&s;oners at the bar infected a great part of the court with a pe&s;tilential &s;ever, of which upwards of three hundred per&s;ons died.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden. Annal. Reg. Elizab. Bacon. Mead.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another very melancholy in&s;tance of the fatal effects of <HI>human effluvia</HI> occurred in the year 1750, during the &s;e&s;&s;ions at the Old Baily. At the&s;e &s;e&s;&s;ions near one hundred pri&s;oners were tried, who were all during the
<PB N="25" REF="28">&s;itting of the court, either placed at the bar, or confined in two &s;mall rooms which opened into the court. The court hou&s;e was crowded with people, great numbers of whom were almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;eized with the Jail Fever, and above forty died of it; but the mu&s;t re|markable circum&s;tance is, that tho&s;e only were affected who were on the left-hand &s;ide of the Lord Mayor, a &s;tream of air from the pri&s;oners being directed to that &s;ide of the room, in con&s;equence of a window being opened on the other. All on the right-hand &s;ide e&s;caped, the <HI>putrid effluvia</HI> being wafted from them to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e in&s;tances, it does not appear that the pri&s;oners, either before or after their trials, were affected with any particular di&s;|temper, re&s;embling that which &s;eized &s;o many, and of which they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have com|municated
<PB N="26" REF="29">the contagion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;t before this &s;heet was going to be printed off, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ter's reports accidentally fell into my hands, in which, I find the following ob&s;ervations.
<Q><P>"It ought to be remembered that at the time this di&s;a&s;ter happened, there was no &s;ickne&s;s in the Gaol more than is common in &s;uch places: this circum|&s;tance, which di&s;tingui&s;heth this from mo&s;t of the ca&s;es of the like kind which we have heard of, &s;ug|ge&s;teth a very proper caution, <HI>not to pre&s;ume too far upon the health of the Gaol, barely becau&s;e the Gaol-Fever is not among the pri&s;oners.</HI></P>
<P>For without doubt, if the points of cleanline&s;s and free air have been greatly neglected, the putrid <HI>effluvia</HI> which the pri&s;oners bring with them in their clothes, &amp;c. e&s;pecially where too many are brought into a crowded court together, may have fatal effects on people who are accu&s;tomed to breathe better air; though the poor wretches, who are in &s;ome mea&s;uve habituated to the fumes of a pri&s;on, may not always be &s;en&s;ible of any great inconvenience from them.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons of chief note who were in court at this time and died of this Fever were, Sir <HI>Samuel Pennant</HI> Lord Mayor for that year, Sir <HI>Thomas Abney</HI> one of the Ju&s;tices of the common pleas, <HI>Char|les Clarke,</HI>E&s;q; one of the barons of the exchequer, and Sir <HI>Daniel Lambert,</HI> one of the aldermen of London. Of le&s;s note a gentleman of the bar, two &s;tudents, one of the under &s;heriffs, an officer of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Lee,</HI> who attended his Lord&s;hip in the Court at that time, &s;everal of the Jury on the Mid|dle&s;ex &s;ide, and about forty other per&s;ons whom bu&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity had brought thither."</P></Q>
<P>Fo&s;ter's Reports, p. 74.</P>
<P>In order to prevent &s;uch melancholy accidents hap|pening in Courts of Ju&s;tice, it perhaps might not be improper to <HI>bathe</HI> the pri&s;oners, and accommodate them with <HI>clean clothes,</HI> or at lea&s;t with <HI>clean linen</HI> immediately before they are brought to the bar. Such regulations I apprehend would not be attended either with much trouble or expence, and might be the means of pre|&s;erving the lives of many individuals, who may be &s;erv|ing, on the&s;e &s;olemn occa&s;ions, their king, and their country.</P></NOTE> How then, it may be a&s;ked, could the di&s;ea&s;e be caught in con|&s;equence of any <HI>effluvia</HI> ari&s;ing from their bodies? If any <HI>putrid effluvia</HI> had been ge|nerated among&s;t them during their confine|ment,
<PB N="27" REF="30">would not they have &s;uffered from it &s;ooner than others to whom it was afterwards applied; in con&s;equence of diffu&s;ion in the air, and more e&s;pecially as it is to be imagined that the bodies of the pri&s;oners were di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="28" REF="31">to receive infection, from their being fed on a poor watery diet, and from that anxiety which they mu&s;t &s;uffer from their &s;ituations?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions let it be in the fir&s;t place, ob&s;erved, that many of the&s;e pri|&s;oners had been long confined; many had
<PB N="29" REF="32">been long accu&s;tomed to filth and uncleanli|ne&s;s, in con&s;equence of which the <HI>putrid effluvia</HI> would be generated gradually, and for along time be con&s;tantly applied to their bodies in &s;mall quantities, till it, at length, became as it were, their natural atmo&s;phere, when they would no more feel its influence, than the <HI>Tanner</HI> perceives the &s;mell of his tanyard, or the <HI>Chandler</HI> the &s;mell of his putrid tallow.</P>
<P>Further, the human body is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power either of accommodating it&s;elf to, or re&s;i&s;ting the effects of many active and noxious bodies, when they are con&s;tantly and gradually applied in &s;mall quantities, which would injure many of the functions of life, nay even in &s;ome ca&s;es bring on death, were they given in large do&s;es at fir&s;t. This may be illu&s;trated by the effects of <HI>opium,</HI> of <HI>hem|lock,</HI> and of <HI>tobacco</HI> on the human body. Every one knows, that a per&s;on, by con&s;tantly accu&s;toming him&s;elf to make u&s;e of the&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="33">drugs, in &s;mall quantities, will in time acquire the habit of taking without danger a quantity at one do&s;e which would either injure the health, or even de&s;troy the life of another per&s;on.</P>
<P>It Is pre&s;umed to be upon this principle that phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons vi&s;it the &s;ick with &s;o much impunity. They are frequently expo&s;ed to the infection, but rarely in contagious di&s;ea&s;es &s;tay any con&s;iderable time with the patient, by which means they never imbibe a large quantity of the contagious matter at any one time, at lea&s;t till their con&s;titutions have acquired the power of re&s;i&s;ting its effects.</P>
<P>For examples of the production and effects of <HI>human effluvia</HI> in ho&s;pitals, &s;hips, and camps, the reader may con&s;ult <HI>Huxham, Priagle,</HI> and <HI>Lind.</HI></P>
<PB N="31" REF="34">
<P>But jails, ho&s;pitals, &s;hips, &amp;c. are not the only places in which this poi&s;on may be pro|duced; it may be generated in any clo&s;e room or apartment where a great number of inhabitants are crowded together, and where little attention is paid to cleanline&s;s. In the in&s;tance of this di&s;ea&s;e which prevailed at Carli&s;le, altho' we perhaps may not be able to point out the particular hou&s;e in which the cau&s;e of the Fever orginated, yet I think we may without much he&s;itation pronounce that the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of it is <HI>human effluvia,</HI> which has been generated in &s;ome little dirty confined place, of which there are great num|bers in Carli&s;le, and every other large manufac|turing town. When I &s;urveyed this town and &s;uburbs, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing many &s;cenes of poverty, of filth and na&s;tine&s;s; and in the bills of mortality for the year 1779 the following ob&s;ervation is made.</P>
<P><Q>"Nervous and putrid &s;evers are not very
<PB N="32" REF="35">frequent; no more than five have &s;uffered by both the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which mu&s;t appear &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hing to one who knows how many inhabitants there are of the lowe&s;t rank, who are crowded in clo&s;e and &s;mall apartments where they &s;leep, eat and pre|pare their victuals; who&s;e food cannot be the mo&s;t nutritive; who &s;eldom change their clothes; and who pay but little atten|tion to cleanline&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Thus it appears probable that <HI>human effluvia</HI> was the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of this Fever. We have only to ob&s;erve that it never &s;eemed to produce fever, except in ca&s;es either where it was applied as it immediately i&s;&s;ued from its &s;ources, and e&s;pecially where it was accumu|lated from want of ventilation, or where it was communicated by means of clothes, &amp;c. that had been u&s;ed by the per&s;on labouring under the fever, in which it may be long re|tained.
<PB N="33" REF="36">Nor was it in general &s;o virulent and active as to produce any noxious effects, un|le&s;s in concurrence with &s;ome other remote cau&s;es, concerning which we &s;hall now &s;peak.</P>
<P>Since I had arranged the above particulars from my notes, I have upon enquiry, di&s;|covered the preci&s;e place where this Fever began; about the latter end of March or the beginning of April. It was in a hou&s;e in Richard-Gate, which contains about half a dozen very poor families; the rooms are exceeding &s;mall, and in order to dimini&s;h the window tax, every window that even poverty could di&s;pen&s;e with was &s;hut up, hence &s;tagnation of air, which was rendered &s;till more noxious by the filth and uncleanli|ne&s;s of the people. The &s;urgeon who atten|ded &s;ome of the&s;e poor wretches, told me, the &s;mell was &s;o offen&s;ive and di&s;agreeable that it
<PB N="34" REF="37">was with difficulty he could &s;tay in the hou&s;e, while he enquired into the &s;ituation of his patient.</P>
<P>One of the per&s;ons affected with the Fever in this hou&s;e was a weaver, who, on his re|covery, went to his u&s;ual employment at a large work&s;hop, where he communicated the di&s;order to his fellow weavers, and from thence the Fever &s;pread all over the town.</P>

</LIST>
<P>At whatever period of the di&s;ea&s;e I am cal|led to a patient, my fir&s;t care is to remove, if po&s;&s;ible, every cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e which con|tinues to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The cau&s;es which continue to operate, and aggravate the di&s;order after it is fully formed, are in general <HI>human efflu|via</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="43">generated in and i&s;&s;uing from the patient's own body; uncleanline&s;s which favours an accumulation of the&s;e <HI>effluvia;</HI> grief; anxi|ety; and fear.</P>
<P>I immediately order the patient clean linen, which ought to be changed every day, or at farthe&s;t every other day, and if po&s;&s;ible endea|vour to direct a &s;tream of fre&s;h air over the bed, which not only carries off the noxious particles as they are formed, prevents an ac|cumulation of them, and keeps the chamber pure and &s;weet, but univer&s;ally acts as a re|fre&s;hing &s;timulus to the patient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More e&s;pecially in the &s;ummer when the weather was hot: &s;ome caution perhaps ought to be u&s;ed during inten&s;e fro&s;t.</NOTE>. But if the &s;ituation of the bed would not admit of this, either a window, or the door, or &s;ometimes
<PB N="41" REF="44">both were advi&s;ed to be kept open, and if the bed had curtains they were always or|dered to be open. The excretions of the &s;ick, whether faeces or urine, &amp;c. were immediately removed.</P>
<P>A &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, e&s;pecially in the early &s;tages of the Fever, tended much to mitigate its virulence; and prevented the di&s;order from &s;preading. On the contrary the neglect of them was, I am &s;atisfied, frequently attended with dangerous and fatal con&s;equences; which nobody I think will doubt, when I inform them that I have been often called to patients on the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh days of the Fever, and found them in a &s;mall dirty room; the bed near a large fire, where the victuals were preparing for the re&s;t of the family; the bed curtains clo&s;e drawn; the &s;heets, and &s;hirt upon the patient's back, almo&s;t black with
<PB N="42" REF="45">dirt, &s;o that he was immer&s;ed in a <HI>putrid efflu|via,</HI> rendered highly poi&s;onous by &s;tagnation, heat, and con&s;equent fermentation.</P>
<P>If the patient lamented the death of &s;ome friend or relation, his &s;orrow was attempted to be &s;cothed; and if he was fearful and anxious, as was often the ca&s;e, about his own fate, he was always encouraged with hopes of a &s;peedy recovery. Fear operates as an ex|ce&s;&s;ive debilitating power on the human body, and when it acts in conjunction with <HI>human effluvia</HI> &s;eldom fails to produce fever. Every thing therefore which tends in the lea&s;t to excite this pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who are already &s;ick, ought to be cau|tiou&s;ly avoided. This ob&s;ervation leads me to take notice of &s;ome cu&s;toms very pre|valent in <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and which in oppo&s;ition to this &s;alutary caution, tend much to alarm and terrify the <HI>&s;ick.</HI></P>

<P>Along with the <HI>&s;aline mixture</HI> the patient was ordered to take the <HI>bark</HI> in &s;ub&s;tance, and
<PB N="48" REF="51">to drink plentifully of port wine, &s;ometimes pure, &s;ometimes, when he complained of thir&s;t, diluted with a &s;mall portion of cold water. If there was any tendency to &s;ickne&s;s, the <HI>&s;aline draught</HI> was taken in the act of <HI>efferve&s;cence</HI> until the &s;ickne&s;s abated.</P>
<P>It happened, however, more u&s;ually that I did not &s;ee the patient till the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e was fini&s;hed; in &s;uch ca&s;es, rather than overload the patient's &s;tomach with too much medicine, I altogether ommitted the <HI>&s;aline mixture,</HI> and entirely confided in the u&s;e of <HI>bark</HI> and wine, and was &s;eldom di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The tonic, cordial, &s;timulant and anti&s;eptic qualities of the&s;e remedies in a remarkable manner increa&s;ed the vigour of the &s;y&s;tem, and in a great mea&s;ure preventd any tendency to putrefaction. For by a copious and liberal u&s;e of them, the pul&s;e became &s;lower, and
<PB N="49" REF="52">&s;tronger; the thir&s;t, and pain of the head abated; the delirium was removed; the urine became higher coloured, and was either cloudy, or depo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ted &s;ome little &s;ediment; and la&s;tly the patient got &s;ome refre&s;hing &s;leep. It is not, however, by admini&s;tering the&s;e remedies in &s;mall quantities, or at di&s;tant intervals, that we are to expect the&s;e &s;alutary effects.</P>
<P>The debility was in general &s;o great, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to throw them in, in large quantities, otherwi&s;e little or no good effects were produced.</P>
<P>The following was my general mode of giving the <HI>bark.</HI></P>

<P>According to the age, &s;ex, con&s;titution of the patient, and urgency of the &s;ymptoms, different quantities of wine were admini&s;tered. I had no opportunity of &s;eeing any very young children in the di&s;ea&s;e, and when it affected children from eight to twelve or fourteen years of age, it was in general very mild.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="54">
<P>To adults I u&s;ually ordered from one bottle to two bottles and one half, in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours; and I believe more might have been taken with advantage, for I never &s;aw any bad effects from an exce&s;s, tho' I have perceived evident ones from a too &s;paring u&s;e of this grateful cordial. Indeed I often found it a difficult matter to per&s;uade the nur&s;es to admini&s;ter it in &s;ufficient quantities, &s;ome were deterred by prejudices, but more I be|lieve were prevented by poverty. Almo&s;t in every ca&s;e it was my con&s;tant cu&s;tom on leaving the patient to urge the plentiful u&s;e of wine. In this method I con&s;tantly per&s;evered till a change took place, which was in general favourable, when the quantity of wine was gradually dimini&s;hed and the patient was &s;up|ported by &s;trong fre&s;h broth, panada &amp;c. and in a little time by &s;olid animal food.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="55">
<P>Soon after this Fever made its appearance I had recour&s;e to <HI>pediluvium,</HI> but I quickly found it was rather prejudicial than u&s;eful, for the debility was in many ca&s;es &s;o extreme that the patient &s;ometimes fainted during the operation, and was always very much fati|gued, which more than counterbalanced the &s;timulating and anti&s;pa&s;modic effects of the warm water.</P>
<P>Fomentations however of the feet and legs, by means of &s;everal folds of flannel wrung out of hot water, were afterwards u&s;ed with apparent advantage, for in this ca&s;e the fatigue occa&s;ioned by the operation was very incon|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters &s;eemed to have little or no effect upon the general &s;y&s;tem, or in rai&s;ing the pul&s;e, but when applied behind the &s;houlders or to the nape of the neck, their operation
<PB N="53" REF="56">was obvious in abating the violent pain of the head. A young girl about nine years old was affected with the Fever, and particularly complained of a very &s;evere and acute pain in her head. The &s;urgeon who attended her pre&s;cribed the <HI>&s;aline mixture</HI> with <HI>tartar emetic</HI> in &s;mall quantities, and took about five or &s;ix ounces of blood from her arm, in hopes of relieving the head ach, but without effect, for it rather increa&s;ed after the bleeding. I was &s;ent for the next day, and notwith&s;tanding her pul&s;e was &s;tronger than in mo&s;t in&s;tances of this Fever, I advi&s;ed a bli&s;ter to be imme|diately applied betwixt her &s;houlders, which &s;oon removed the pain in her head. She was at the &s;ame time ordered to take a &s;trong <HI>de|coction</HI> of the <HI>bark</HI> with plenty of wine which &s;oon freed her from all complaints. I after|wards in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, always pre|&s;cribbed <HI>bli&s;ters,</HI> and generally with &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="57">
<P>A <HI>Diarrhea</HI> often occurred in the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ca&s;e, &s;ometimes even in the fir&s;t. Whether it was occa&s;ioned by the <HI>bark,</HI> or was a con&s;equence of the previous debility is a matter of no great moment. It was al|ways a di&s;agreeable, often a dangerous &s;ymp|tom, and never to be tri&s;led with; for when it was even moderate it never failed to weaken the patient greatly. Di&s;regarding therefore all ill grounded apprehend&s;ions of blocking up the pa&s;&s;ages and retaining a putrid <HI>&s;omes</HI> in the inte&s;tinal canal, I con&s;tantly attempted to put a &s;top to the evacution as quickly as po&s;&s;i|ble, and where I was fortunate enough to &s;uc|ceed my patients always recovered.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e I ordered in &s;ome ca&s;es &s;ix or eight drops of <HI>tinct. thebaic.</HI> in every do&s;e of the bark. But when the <HI>diarrhaea</HI> was likely to be violent, and not to be ea&s;ily re&s;trained, the <HI>bark</HI> was di&s;continued, the quantity of
<PB N="55" REF="58">wine was increa&s;ed, and a cordial a&s;tringent compo&s;ition &s;ome what like the following was made u&s;e of.</P>

<P>If on the other hand &s;everal days elap&s;ed without any evacuation by &s;tool, a &s;imple injection of warm milk and water had the de|&s;ired effect.

<P>It &s;ometimes happened that the patient was affected with &s;ymptoms of a <HI>cold</HI> or <HI>catarrh,</HI> and in &s;uch ca&s;es the pul&s;e was not altogether &s;o &s;mall and weak as I have before repre&s;ented in the hi&s;tory of the Fever; and in one par|ticular in&s;tance I found the pul&s;e &s;o &s;trong that I &s;hould have been induced to have drawn a little blood, had I not been previou&s;ly ac|quainted with the nature of the prevailing epidemic, and the dangerous con&s;equences of bleeding.

<P>With re&s;pect to the anomalous &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as a difficulty of making water and in con&s;equence of it a &s;welling of the abdomen,
<PB N="58" REF="61">I left them entirely to nature, and when the patient recovered from the fever and was able to get out of bed, the di&s;charge of urine not only became free but copious, which in a very little time dimini&s;hed the tumour of the belly.</P>
<P>Through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, when fruit could be procured, the patient was de&s;ired to eat as much of it as he plea&s;ed, except when contra-indicated by a diarrhaea.
