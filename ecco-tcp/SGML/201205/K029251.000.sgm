<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which (for the better under&s;tanding of the Book) the Reader is de&s;ired to peru&s;e fir&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little Book, purely for want of Lei&s;ure to look over and Cor|rect it in order for a &s;econd Edi|tion, has been, out of Priot a con|&s;iderable While; neither &s;hould I have &s;par'd time now from my other Affairs and private Practice, which indeed is &s;ufficient to ingro&s;s all my Thoughts, had it not been very often call'd for, &s;ince the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion has been Sold off, and my &s;elf mush importun'd to reprint it, on account of the &s;ervice the Medicines pre|&s;cib'd in it have done, daily do, and are further likely to do, tho&s;e afflicted with the Illne&s;&s;es it treats of.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>In this &s;econd Edition I have added, al|tered, and amended, whatever the many Ob&s;ervations I have made, and my longer Experience caus'd me to think nece&s;&s;ary, and have given every where very particu|lar and more minute Directions, how the Patients &s;hould manage them&s;elves under the Cour&s;e of Remedies I have advis'd to, than was in the fir&s;t Edition, &s;o that as the Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s of the Age we live in, and no other rea&s;on, made me deter|mine when I fir&s;t publi&s;h'd this Book, not to &s;et my Name to it, or be known as the Author, there will now be the le&s;s oc|ca&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>I de&s;ign'd to have added &s;ome very re|markable Ca&s;es of Per&s;ons that I have very lately Cur'd, of the &s;everal Di&s;tempers the Book treats of, and that by the very Medicines I have herein pre&s;cribed; but con&s;idering that tho&s;e Additions, would inhance the price of the Book, and that the Ca&s;es in&s;erted in the fir&s;t Edition, are &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate the Method recom|mended, I re&s;olv'd to let it remain (in that re&s;pect) ju&s;t as it was before.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t commenced Phy&s;ician, I con&s;ider'd how and after what manner I could render my &s;elf &s;erviceable to the
<PB REF="5">Publick in my Station, and ob&s;erving that few of our Faculty had bent their Study, to gain a true Knowledge of the Cau&s;e and Cure of Female Grievances, under which abundance of Women liv'd mi&s;erably, labouring with afflicting Weak|ne&s;&s;es, continually Langui&s;hing and Con|&s;uming by deplorable Illne&s;&s;es, peculiar to that Sex, and at la&s;t forced to &s;ubmit to Death, purely for want of proper Advice and Medicines for their Di&s;tempers, which I then thought, as I &s;oon after found, might be ea&s;ily Cured by an ingenious Phy&s;ician, if he rightly under&s;tood the true Cau&s;e of them: Seriou&s;ly weighing this, I re&s;olved to Study the Cure of the Weak|ne&s;&s;es and Maladies incident only to Women, many of the Gentlemen of our Profe&s;&s;ion (tho' mo&s;t Learned aind Inge|nious in other Ca&s;es) not rightly under|&s;tanding Female Di&s;tempers, becau&s;e not inclined to Study or Practi&s;e that way, whereby thou&s;ands of Women, I believe, have lamentably &s;uffered many Years to|gether, and numbers gone to the Grave many Years &s;ooner, than they would have done, had they been treated in a proper Method, and with the mo&s;t Efficacious Medicines.</P>
<PB REF="6">
<P>I know it is a common Thing for &s;ome Gentlemen of our Art, to excu&s;e their not practi&s;ing in tho&s;e Illne&s;&s;es, by alledging that Women have their Midwives to ap|ply to in &s;uch Ca&s;es; but if they mature|ly con&s;ider'd the danger Women are in, from even the lea&s;t degree of the Weak|ne&s;&s;es I have in this Book treated of, I am &s;ure they would be of another Opi|nion: For indeed how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that Midwives, though Ingenious in their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould Cure Di&s;tempers of which they know not the Cau&s;e, but are truly ignorant of the whole Matter; being unacquainted with the Medical Art, not in the lea&s;t under&s;tanding the Virtue of Medicines, or the Rea&s;on of their dif|ferent Operations upon the Blood and o|ther Fluids of the Body? So that if a Wo|man is cur'd of Weakne&s;s or Illne&s;s by them, it may be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a mere Chance, and &s;he has rea&s;on to thank God, that in&s;tead of Cure &s;he did not meet with Ruin, having tru&s;ted her Life to the Unskilful; which Women would never do, if they were &s;en&s;ible of the Nature and Danger of even their &s;lighte&s;t Indi&s;po+&s;itions, if not manag'd rightly.</P>
<PB REF="7">
<P>Thus, when I fir&s;t began to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick, being convinced by the&s;e Melan|choly Reflections, that I could be very u&s;eful in my Generation, by &s;tudying and obtaining the perfect Knowledge of the In|di&s;po&s;itions incident only to the Female Sex, I re&s;olved to endeavour to find out the real Cau&s;e thereof, and, if po&s;&s;ible, a better and more certain method of Cure than com|monly practi&s;ed, which with diligent Study, much Application and careful Ob&s;ervation, I quickly obtain'd in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, that I thank God I have had very great Suc|ce&s;s, and have perfectly cured abundance of the Female Sex, who had &s;uffer'd many Years under deplorable Sickne&s;s; and have al&s;o retrieved &s;everal from the edge of the Grave, who had been given over by all; in&s;omuch, that many, who through Illne&s;s afflicting them have been reduced to mere Skeletons, and &s;o weak as &s;carcely able to &s;tand, I have, through the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, re&s;tored to their perfect Health and Strength, &s;o as to become more brisk and well than ever, and to Conceive and bear Children, and that by the Method and Medicines inferred in this Book, which, after many Changes and Experiments, I have pitch'd upon, and by unque&s;&s;ionable Experience have found them ab&s;olutely
<PB REF="8">Effectual, and do now wholly rely upon them in my private Practice.</P>
<P>But becoming &s;till more and more &s;en&s;i|ble of the Mi&s;ery mo&s;t Women undergo at one time or other, through Illne&s;s afflicting them, and con&s;idering that a great many of the Female Sex, are unwilling to make known their private Indi&s;po&s;itions to Men, (tho' that Mode&s;ty often proves the Lo&s;s of their Lives) and that tho&s;e who do, many times &s;tay till too late to be Cured, or per|haps fall into the Hands of Practitioners, that do not rightly under&s;tand their Di&s;tem|pers, or el&s;e apply to Midwives for help, commonly to their Ruin: I &s;ay, thinking on the di&s;mal Misfortunes and Calamitous Circum&s;tances, that thus attend, injure, and often de&s;troy many Women in the Prime of their Age, it put me upon undertaking &s;omething whereby I might be more ge|nerally u&s;eful to the World, and in a great|er degree &s;erviceable to Suffering Women, than I could be in Private Practice only: Therefore I cho&s;e to write this little Book, wherein I have practically treated in a familiar way, and &s;o as the meane&s;t Read|er may under&s;tand, of the Symptoms, Na|ture, Cau&s;e, and Cure of the Secret Illne&s;&s;es that Women are &s;ubject to, and have pre|&s;crib'd,
<PB REF="9">as before mention'd, &s;uch Medicines as will mo&s;t certainty Cure them without Trouble; whereby Women, who are not willing to make known their Weakne&s;&s;es and Di&s;ea&s;es, may be acquainted with their Di&s;tempers, and know how to Cure them|&s;elves &s;afely, and for a trifling Charge; by which means, tho&s;e who before were thought uncapable of Conceiving, may be render'd Fruitful, and others be retriev'd from the Danger of Death, which mo&s;t of the Illne&s;&s;es, I have mention'd, will certainly bring upon the Patients, if not timely Cur'd.</P>
<P>The Medicines I have advi&s;ed to, are plea&s;ant to take, &s;afe and ea&s;ie in Opera|tion, and being founded upon unerring Experience, are certainly to be depended upon, as ab&s;olutely Effectual for the Weak|ne&s;&s;es and Illne&s;&s;es they are mentioned to Cure.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering the Trouble and Dif|ficulty mo&s;t Women would find, to get the Medicines made up, and the hazard they would run in tru&s;ting to Apothe|caries Boys, that under&s;tand not the Art|ful Method of compounding Medicines: Therefore, that nothing might be want|ing
<PB REF="10">wherein I could render my &s;elf &s;er|viceable, I have left a quantity of all the Medicines, mention'd in this Book, pre|pared with my own Hand, with the Gentlewoman, at the <HI>Two Blue Posts,</HI> near the <HI>Square,</HI> in <HI>Haydon-Yard</HI> in the <HI>Mino|ries, London;</HI> where this Book is al&s;o Sold, and intend always &s;o to do, for the Benefit of the Female Sex, while God grants me Life; and I here a&s;&s;ure the World, that I will never &s;uffer the Medi|cines to be &s;old el&s;ewhere, without fir&s;t giving Notice in another Edition of this Book; &s;o that all Per&s;ons who have oc|ca&s;ion for any of the Medicines herein pre&s;crib'd, will, by buying them there, always be &s;ure to have them right and well prepared, upon which they may entirely rely for the Cure of the Illne&s;&s;es they are appropriated to.</P>
<P>And the better to prevent all Abu&s;es, I have de&s;ignedly conceal'd the chief Chy|mical Preparation in every Pre&s;cription, on which Secret, the Virtue of each Medi|cine, mo&s;tly depends, and without which, would be almo&s;t in&s;ignificant, but being regularly Compounded, or mix'd, accord|ing to Art, does &s;o alter, ferment, and a|dapt all the Ingredients in each pre&s;cribed
<PB REF="11">Remedy, to the Cure of the Illne&s;s for which it is intended, that were it di&s;|cover'd, it would appear wonderful to all Arti&s;ts in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of my thus concealing the mo&s;t Powerful Ingredient of each Medi|cine, was, that becau&s;e Women cannot make up the Medicines them&s;elves, they mu&s;t, had I freely declared the whole, have had them made up by an Apothe|cary, who, very likely, by rea&s;on of the dearne&s;s of the main Ingredient in each, would exact an Extravagant Price, or el&s;e not make the Medicines up right; but put in one thing in&s;tead of another, which many Apothecaries too often do, in making up Chargeable Pre&s;criptions, to the detriment of the Patient and Di&s;ad|vantage of the Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Therefore to prevent any from being &s;o gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon, and to reme|dy all Inconveniencies, was it, that I did not make known the chief Ingredient in each Pre&s;cription; but appointed the Me|dicines, rightly prepared with great Care and Exactne&s;s, to be Sold at the Place before mentioned, and for the fixed ea&s;y Prices &s;et down in the Catalogue of them
<PB REF="12">at the end of the Book, which Prices are as rea&s;onable, as the Medicines can well be allowed for, and much Cheaper than they would be, if rightly made up in &s;mall quanties by any other Per&s;on, were the Specifick Preparation in each Remedy known; I having in this Second Edition, carefully calculated the intrin&s;ick Value of them, and for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances may not be extraordinary, low|er'd the Price where there was room for it, &s;o that mo&s;t of the Medicines are now &s;et down at a cheaper Rate, than they were in the fir&s;t Edition.</P>
<P>Now by this means, all Gentlewomen, and others, will be freed from Trouble, and be&s;ure of having the true Preparation, which will always prove effectual, and that at an ea&s;y Rate, by only &s;ending a Ser|vant or other Per&s;on to the Place afore|&s;aid, to ask for &s;uch or &s;uch a Medicine, by its Name or Number, and by giving &s;o much for it, as in the Catalogue is &s;et down to be the Price.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who live in the Country may al&s;o order any Friend in <HI>London,</HI> or a Car|rier that comes to Town, to buy at the &s;ame Place any of the Medicines they
<PB REF="13">have occa&s;ion for, and &s;o be &s;upply'd with them with Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus the main Intent of writing this Treati&s;e was for the Service and Benefit of the Female Sex; and therefore with|out &s;tudying Artfully to embelli&s;h it with powerful Rhetorick, or a beautiful Stile, I cho&s;e to let it appear in a plain Dre&s;s, &s;o as to be perfectly under&s;tood by the meane&s;t Capacity, which perhaps may give Di&s;ta&s;te to &s;ome of our Learned Criticks, who I did not de&s;ign to plea&s;e, and who&s;e Cen&s;ure I do not value, being well a&s;|&s;ured, that all Men of Ingenuity and Candour, who Practi&s;e Phy&s;ick, in who&s;e Hands it may chance to fall, will applaud the Undertaking; for they will plainly per|ceive that an Intent of being Serviceable to my Generation, was the chief Motive of it, and will al&s;o find, (notwith&s;tanding I have conceal'd the main Ingredient in every Pre&s;cription) that the Book will be of U&s;e to young Practitioners in Phy|&s;ick, I having in a more conci&s;e manner di&s;cover'd the Signs, Nature, Cau&s;es, and be&s;t and neare&s;t Method of Cure, of Fe|male Grievances, than perhaps they may el&s;ewhere meet with, and in the Seventh Chapter treating of Barrenne&s;s, have given
<PB REF="14">&s;uch a clear and particular Account of Con|ception and Generation, as may &s;erve to re|ctify the Notions of &s;everal, who have im|bib'd very ab&s;urd Opinions concerning them.</P>
<P>One thing I mu&s;t inform my Readers of, which is, That while I was writing this Book, I was often concern'd, that nece&s;&s;ity obliged me to mention Womens Weakne&s;&s;es &s;o plainly, as I found my &s;elf forced to do, to be well under&s;tood by the Female Sex; could I have made it intelligible otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould have been heartily glad; but that being impo&s;&s;ible, I have treated of all their Indi&s;po&s;itions, with as much Caution and Mode&s;ty as I could, and therefore hope none will make an ill u&s;e of it, or in the lea&s;t blame me on that account.</P>
<P>I &s;hall no longer detain my Readers, but hoping it will meet with a Reception &s;uitable to my good Intention of Writing it for the Benefit of Suffering Women, and leaving them to judge of it them&s;elves, &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf Their</P>

<HEAD>A Rational Account Of the Natural Weakne&s;&s;es of Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN treating of the Natural Weakne&s;&s;es and Di&s;tempers peculiarly incident to the Female Sex, I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e occa&s;ion'd by the Irregularity of the Men&s;trual Flux, or Cour&s;es, which begin to flow in Young Women when they are about Fourteen Years old, and in &s;ome &s;ooner: About that Age Virgins begin to grow ripe, and if in Health, to think of Love; the Blood al&s;o at certain Periods undergoes a new Ferment, and while that continues, i&s;&s;ues out through the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="2" REF="18">that open into the Womb: And this Natural Purgation, or Flux of Blood, is cal|led the Monthly Terms or Cour&s;es.</P>
<P>When they fir&s;t come down in Maids, they many times do not flow above once in two Months or ten Weeks; but as the Per&s;on grows more ripe, and the blood and its Na|tural Ferment encrea&s;es, they come down oftner, till the &s;ettled Term of once a Month is fixed, and then they continue &s;o con&s;tant|ly till Forty, Forty five, and &s;ometimes till Fifty Years of Age, or longer, except when Illne&s;s, being with Child, or Suckling Chil|dren hinders.</P>
<P>They flow generally from fir&s;t to la&s;t, four, five or &s;ix Days, and &s;ometimes, though ve|ry rarely, &s;even; and the Quantity of Blood that comes away during that time, (if the Flux is regular, and the Per&s;on in perfect Health) is commonly as much as may be contained in the Shell of a Goo&s;e Egg; but in &s;ome Women, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a &s;trong Body and &s;anguine Complexion, they flow in a larger quantity than in others: If the Terms flow con&s;tantly once a Month, and in a due quantity, they generally pre&s;erve Women in perfect Health; but if they do not, or if there is any Di&s;order in this Flux, Women cannot be well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">cau&s;e the Cour&s;e of Nature is then changed, and her admira|ble Order broke.</P>
<P>The Di&s;orders this Monthly Purgation is
<PB N="3" REF="19">liable to, being &s;everal, and very different, I intend to treat of them, and of the other In|di&s;po&s;itions Women are particularly &s;ubject to, in their Order, and under their re&s;pe|&s;pective Heads or Chapters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Deficiency of the Terms, and Green-Sickne&s;s in Virgins.</HEAD>
<P>THE Deficiency or Suppre&s;&s;ion of the Cour&s;es, is when they flow too &s;el|dom, or but little in quantity, (that is too &s;pa|ringly, as by Drops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) or not at all: The Fault is either in the Blood, (which is then too gro&s;s or thick, occa&s;ion'd by a bad Sto|mach, ill Dige&s;tion of Food, Colds, Grief, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or in the Ve&s;&s;els of the Womb, through which the Terms flow, which then are ob&s;tructed by a Vi&s;cous or Tough Humour.</P>
<P>If the Badne&s;s of the blood is the Cau&s;e of the Deficiency of the Cour&s;es, the Per&s;on be|comes pale and dull, unwilling to &s;tir about, and is afflicted with Lo&s;s of Appetite, loath|ing of Food, de&s;ire after things not fit to be eaten, bad Dige&s;tion, Pain in the Stomach, which in &s;ome Patients is &s;o violent by Fits, as hardly to be borne, Shortne&s;s of Breath, often &s;welling about the Ankles, &s;ometimes vomiting, and univer&s;al Di&s;order; al&s;o if any

My Wife gave the Remainder of the Pouder to a Neighbour's Daughter, who was in the &s;ame Condition, but &s;o weak as not fit to take the Purging Pills, and that alone has Cured her, in about a Fort|night, all but Want of Strength, which &s;he now daily recovers, and begins to look brisk, and have a good Stomach.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the immoderate Flux, or Over-flowing of the <HI>Terms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Cour&s;es are properly deem'd im|moderate, when the Blood flows from the Womb-Ve&s;&s;els in too large a Quan|tity, or too long together, or oftner than once a Month. In &s;ome Women they continue ma|ny Days together, in others not longer than u&s;ual, but then return often, as once a Fort|night, or &s;ooner, and in &s;ome the Flux is more, in others le&s;s violent, many Women al&s;o, as &s;oon as the Cour&s;es &s;top, are afflicted with the Whites, or Piles, and &s;ometimes with both.</P>
<P>This Illne&s;s, or exce&s;&s;ive Flowing of the Terms, is generally cau&s;ed by an evil Fer|ment, occa&s;ioned by &s;harp &s;corbutick Salts in
<PB N="16" REF="32">the Blood and Juices, and &s;ometimes by Di&s;|order of the Womb-Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The Overflowing of the Cour&s;es is mo&s;t commonly accompanied with a burning Fe|veri&s;h Heat, tearing Pains in the &s;mall of the Back, Pain and Heat about the Neck of the Womb, violent Head-ach, Lo&s;s of Appetite, and langui&s;hing Weakne&s;s of the whole Bo|dy; and if not &s;peedily cured, reduces the Per&s;on exceedingly, cau&s;ing total Barrenne&s;s, la&s;ting Weakne&s;s, pining Con&s;umption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which terminate in Death, if not timely re|medied.</P>
<P>If the Blood that comes away is of a bright red Colour, and when taken upon Linnen and dry, di&s;covers a pale Circle, it &s;hews that the Blood is thin and wateri&s;h, the Ve&s;&s;els of the Womb too lax or loo&s;e, the Patient very weak, but not exceeding Feve|ri&s;h; but if it be of a deep red, and ea&s;ily clots, it is then a Sign of a Redundancy of Blood, and that the Per&s;on is very hot feveri&s;h and unea&s;ie, and if the Blood in coming away cau&s;es a great Itching and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s of the Parts, it &s;hews, that the Juices of the Body are very full of &s;harp acrid Salts</P>
<P>Now to cure this Indi&s;po&s;ition (Revul&s;ion by Bleeding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being fir&s;t made) &s;uch Medi|cines mu&s;t be pre&s;cribed, as by their cooling, ab&s;orbent, and &s;ub-a&s;tringent Qualities, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> put a Stop to the violent Ferment of the Blood, allay Thir&s;t and Heat, take off the

<P>Thus, the&s;e Directions being followed, and the Medicines regularly taken, the over-flowing of the Cour&s;es, though never &s;o bad, will mo&s;t certainly be cured; an emi|nent In&s;tance or two of which, occurring to my Memory, I judge the Relation will be acceptable, as well as &s;erviceable to the Rea|der, and therefore will in&s;ert the Particulars, and &s;o end this Chapter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Ca&s;e I de&s;ign to mention, is of a Gentlewoman about Thirty, who for &s;ix or eight Months before, had been afflicted with the flowing of her Cour&s;es con&s;tantly once a Fortnight, in the &s;ame quantity that u&s;ed to flow, when &s;he was in good Order, once a Month, and as &s;oon as they went off, &s;he was exceedingly troubled with the
<PB N="22" REF="38">Piles for three or four Days, and after that, with the Whites to an exce&s;&s;ive Degree which always held her till her Terms came down again. This Indi&s;po&s;ition had reduced her to exceeding Weakne&s;s, her Stomach was much out of Order; &s;he was continually feveri&s;h, had great Pain in her Head, but a more violent Pain in her Back, in&s;omuch that &s;he was hardly able to walk about Hou&s;e. As &s;oon as I was acquainted with her Illne&s;s, I found that her Blood, by the pale Circle it di&s;cover'd upon Linnen, was poor, wateri&s;h, and very acrid, which occa|&s;ioned the Feveri&s;h Heat, and all the other Symptoms.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering that her Stomach and Bowels were very foul, I therefore fir&s;t or|der'd her to take a very large Do&s;e of my Laxative Electuary the next Morning to clean&s;e them, which had very good Effect, and the Day following I cau&s;ed her to begin my Cooling Anodyne Pouder, and plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary, and take them as before directed, for two Days, which took off all immoderate Heat, and &s;topt her Cour&s;es, af|ter that, I directed her to continue the plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary alone, for a Fortnight, in order to ab&s;orb all &s;harp Humours, rectifie her Blood, and &s;trengthen her Back and Womb Ve&s;&s;els; but in three Days time &s;he &s;ent me Word, that &s;he believed &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="23" REF="39">be troubled with the Piles, being &s;omewhat Co&s;tive, and a little pained when &s;he went to Stool. I therefore order'd her to take a large Do&s;e of the Laxative Electuary again the next Morning betimes, and to omit the plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary that Day, and &s;o to take the Laxative One, once every three or four Days, if &s;he found her &s;elf Co&s;tive, and the plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary con&s;tant|ly the other Days for the Remainder of the Fortnight, or till &s;he was quite well, and had perfectly recovered her Strength.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he took the quantity of a large Wallnut of the Laxative Electuary, the next Morning, which gave her two or three loo&s;e Stools, and wholly freed her from all Appre|hen&s;ions of the Piles, and the next Day, &s;he began the plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary again, and thus by following Directions as above, &s;he was &s;oon perfectly cured, has had her Cour&s;es in regular Order, never in the lea&s;t been troubled with the Whites or Piles; but lived in good Health and Strength ever &s;ince, it being now four Months ago.</P>
<P>The other Ca&s;e that occurs to my Mind, was of a young Gentlewoman of about Eighteen Years of Age, of a jolly &s;anguine Complexion, to whom I was &s;ent for about three Months &s;ince. Till a little before tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> time &s;he had always enjoyed perfect Health&punc; but then was taken of a &s;udden with a vio|lent
<PB N="24" REF="40">Fever, and an exceeding Flux of the Cour&s;es; when I came to her &s;he had had them for ten or twelve Days upon her, and they &s;till continued to flow in an exceed|ing large quantity.</P>
<P>Her Fever, notwith&s;tanding the great Lo&s;s of Blood &s;he had &s;uffer'd, being very high, I order'd her to bleed immediately in the Arm, which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure diverted the Cour&s;e of the Blood; I did not give her my Laxative Electuary, &s;he being very weak, and her Sto|mach and Bowels not foul; but pre&s;ently &s;ent her my Cooling Anodyne Pouder, and plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary, directing her to take both in the Manner above order'd, for about four Days; &s;he had not taken above &s;ix Do&s;es of each, but her Feveri&s;h Heat was overcome and her Cour&s;es &s;topt; on the fourth Day &s;he happened to be a little griped, therefore I order'd her to leave off the Cooling Ano|dyne Pouder, and take only the plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary, which &s;he did for two or three days longer, and it perfectly cured her, &s;he only remaining a little weak, occa&s;ion'd by the exceeding Flux &s;he had labour'd under; but &s;he &s;oon recover'd her Strength without any more Medicines, and has remain'd well ever &s;ince. There was no ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for her to continue the plea&s;ant Specifick Electu|ary any longer, becau&s;e the &s;udden hot Fer|mentation of her Blood, which was the cau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="41">of her Illne&s;s, being taken off by Bleeding and the cooling Medicines, the Effects of cour&s;e cea&s;ed without much Fear of return|ing: But in the Gentlewoman's Ca&s;e fir&s;t mentioned, it was quite different; for her Ill|ne&s;s being cau&s;ed by acrid Salts in her Blood, and having continued a long time, it had much injur d the Womb-Ve&s;&s;els, which could not be &s;trengthen'd &s;ufficiently, nor her Blood have been rectified as it ought, without taking the plea&s;ant Specifick Electuary, for a Fort|night or more; and indeed, could the young Gentlewoman have been per&s;uaded to have taken it for Nine or Ten Days longer, which &s;he refu&s;ed, it would have been the better for her, for &s;he would have thereby recover'd more Strength in one Day, than without it &s;he did in three, it being &s;o excellently pow|erful in re&s;toring Per&s;ons weakned by that Illne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Piles.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Di&s;temper being common to Men, as well as to Women, it may be thought &s;trange that I treat of it here; but con&s;idering that many of the Fair Sex do not care to acquaint Phy&s;icians that they are af|flicted with the Piles, it made me conclude that this Chapter would prove as &s;erviceable, and be as acceptable to them as the o|thers.</P>
<P>The Indi&s;po&s;ition called the Haemorrhoids, or Piles, is mi&s;erably painful, making the Patient exceeding Re&s;tle&s;s, Fretful and Faint; it is a Swelling and Sorene&s;s of the Haemor|rhoid Veins, ju&s;t within, and &s;ometimes ju&s;t without the Fundament: When they do not bleed, they are called the Blind Piles and then they generally &s;well much, and cau&s;e violent Pain and inexpre&s;&s;ible Torture at going to Stool: The Bleeding Piles though very &s;ore, are not &s;o bad or dan|gerous
<PB N="33" REF="49">as the other, except the Flux is ex|ceding Violent, and continues long, for then it induces Fainting, Swooning, Lo&s;s of Strength, Citron like Colour of the Skin, re|&s;embling the Jaundi&s;e, Evil Habit of the Body, Con&s;umption, Drop&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Cau&s;e of this Illne&s;s is mo&s;t common|ly a Rarefaction and Fermentation of the Blood and Humours, as the Feveri&s;h Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Patient at that time plainly &s;hews, &s;o that a Redundancy of Blood, Stop|page of the Terms, (either accidentally, or by irregular Methods) Colds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often occa&s;ion the Piles, by hindring the u&s;ual Se|cretions, and thereby inflaming the Blood, and putting it into a great Ferment, when filling the Haemorrhoid Veins, if they ea&s;ily open, it i&s;&s;ues out, and if they do not, it there &s;tagnates and &s;wells them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as before mentioned; &s;ometimes the Piles are cau&s;ed by hard Riding, or other violent Exerci&s;e, al&s;o &s;evere purging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, the Illne&s;s commonly goes off, by Ea&s;e, Re&s;t, and temperate Living.</P>
<P>If the blind Piles continue long, the Swel|ling may grow Scirrhous, and an Ulcer, or Fi&s;tula, difficult to Cure, may &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>To prevent which, and Cure the Piles, pro|per Alterative and Cooling Medicines mu&s;t be given inwardly, to allay the Ferment of the Blood, reduce its Di&s;cracy, and thereby de|&s;troy the prime Cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper,
<PB N="34" REF="50">whil&s;t &s;uitable intrin&s;ick Remedies are out|wardly applied, to di&s;cu&s;s the Tumour, ea&s;e Pain, and perfectly heal and cure the affect|ed Part.</P>
<P>If the Patient be Feveri&s;h, or the Pain and Inflammation great, Bleeding in the Arm, to the quantity of about Ten Ounces, will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to divert the Hu|mours; after which, let as much of the follow|ing Alterative Pouder, as will lie heapd up|on a Shilling, be taken four times every Day, <HI>viz.</HI> betimes in the Morning Fa&s;ting, at E|leven a Clock in the Forenoon, at Four a Clock in the Afternoon, and at Night going to Bed: The Patient may take it in a Spoonful of Beer, Water-gruel, or any other &s;mall Li|quor, &s;he likes better, drinking a little of the &s;ame, made luke-warm, after each Do&s;e.

<P>Take Cream of Tartar, &s;ix Drams; Liquorice Pouder, and White Amber prepared, of each two Drams and a half; Prunel-&s;tone, two Drams; &s;weet Salt of Steel, a Dram; of my Mineral Magi&s;tery, two Drams; mix and make a fine Pouder according to Art.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="51">
<P>And at the &s;ame time the Patient is taking this Alterative Pouder, let the following In|trin&s;ick Liniment be u&s;ed three or four times in a Day, or oftner, applying it with a fine warm Linnen Rag, or with your warm Fingers very gently to the affected part, en|deavouring when the Piles are inward, to get as much of the Liniment up as can be.

</FLOATEXT></P>
<P>This Intrin&s;ick Liniment quickly gives Ea&s;e, and mightily contributes to the Cure of both blind and bleeding Piles.</P>
<P>Thus the Alterative Pouder mu&s;t be con|&s;tantly taken, and the Intrin&s;ick Liniment be carefully u&s;ed according to the&s;e Directi|ons, till the Cure either of blind or bleeding Piles is perfectly accompli&s;hed: They will quickly give Ea&s;e, and a&s;&s;uredly compleat the Cure of the Piles in a &s;hort time; for the Alterative Pouder effectually &s;trikes at the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of that Illne&s;s, and prevents the parts being &s;upply'd with &s;harp Humours, while the Intrin&s;ick Liniment, after an admi|rable
<PB N="36" REF="52">Manner ea&s;es all pain, di&s;cu&s;&s;es the Tu|mour or Swelling of the blind Piles, and heals and perfectly cures the bleeding.</P>
<P>The Alterative Pouder agrees with the Stomach, and takes off all Feveri&s;h Heat, without di&s;ordering the Body in the lea&s;t; it &s;ometimes makes the Belly a little loo&s;e, and thereby contributes very much to the Cure; for nothing is more tormenting, to tho&s;e troubled with the Piles, than to be Co&s;tive, or hard bound, it putting them to intollerable pain and mi&s;ery at going to Stool.</P>
<P>Therefore, if the Alterative Pouder &s;hould not loo&s;en the Belly, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for the Patient, once every two or three Days, to take a Do&s;e of my Laxative Electuary, pre&s;crib'd in the &s;econd Chapter of this Book, page 17. aforegoing, taking it exactly as is there directed; minding only to omit taking the Alterative Pouder, that Day the Laxative Electuary is taken.</P>
<P>The Patient, during the time &s;he is affli|cted with the Piles, ought to drink freely of Water-Gruel, Tea, or Po&s;&s;et-drink, made &s;mall, and carefully ab&s;tain from &s;trong Li|quors, Spices, Salt Meats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which tend to inflame and increa&s;e the Malady.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e Directions being truly ob&s;erved, this grievous Indi&s;po&s;ition, which &s;ome labour under many Months will be perfectly cu|red in a little time, &s;o as not to return again.</P>

<P>About three Months ago, I was &s;ent for to a Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lewoman who had been afflicted with the Piles almo&s;t continually, for &s;ome Years: She having taken very many Medi|cines to little or no purpo&s;e, told me, &s;he fear'd &s;he &s;hould never be Cured, yet lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould be wanting to her &s;elf, hearing of my Skill, was the Rea&s;on &s;he had &s;ent for me, and de&s;ired I would u&s;e my utmo&s;t En|deavour to free her, if po&s;&s;ible, from her Ill|ne&s;s; She acquainted me al&s;o that &s;ometimes they bled pretty much, and then &s;he was much ea&s;ier than when they only &s;well'd and did not; &s;he was at that time in much Tor|ment, and being of a hot Con&s;titution, and &s;omething Feveri&s;h, I order'd her immediate|ly to be blooded and pre&s;crib'd my Altera|tive Pouder and intrin&s;ick Liniment, the fir&s;t to be taken, and the latter to be u&s;ed exactly as I have directed in this Chapter, for a Week or nine Days, at the End of which, &s;he was very well, and better, as &s;he affirmed, than &s;he had been for any time in nine Months before; neverthele&s;s, I order'd her by all Means to continue the Alterative Pouder for a Fortnight or three Weeks longer, without u&s;ing the Intrin&s;ick Liniment any more.</P>
<P>My ordering her to take the Alterative Pouder &s;o long, was with de&s;ign to correct her Blood, and wholly &s;ubdue the Acrid Principle, or Cau&s;e of that &s;evere Malady that had &s;o long afflicted her, which it ef|fectually

<P>Much about the &s;ame Time, I had another Woman under my Care, who was al&s;o &s;ore|ly troubled with the Piles; her Blood was very Acrid, but &s;he was not exceeding Feve|ri&s;h, yet was then in exceeding pain, and a little before &s;he &s;ent for me, the Piles had bled very much, I therefore did not order her to be blooded, but directed her to take my Al|terative Pouder, and u&s;e my Intrin&s;ick Lini|ment pre&s;ently, and continue them till &s;he was cured: In four Days time &s;he was tol|lerably well but happening to be Co&s;tive, I directed her to take a Do&s;e of my Laxative Electuary, once every three or four Days, and to take the Alterative Pouder, as dire|cted, on the other Days, which &s;he did, and was perfectly cured in a Fortnights time.</P>
<P>I could give many more In&s;tances of per|&s;ons cured of the Piles by the&s;e Remedies, who by Rea&s;on of their being exceeding bad, and having been &s;o long afflicted with them, imagined they could never be cured; but de&s;igning brevity, I &s;hall wave that Trouble.</P>

<P>The Whites &s;ometimes come away in large, and &s;ometimes in but &s;mall Quantities, are attended with Pain in the &s;mall of the Back, Pain in the Head, want of Appetite, bad Dige&s;tion, Wearine&s;s, Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, &s;ome|times Swelling of the Legs, pale Counte|nance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Maids of a weakly Con&s;tituti|on, are often afflicted with this Malady, as well as Married Women and Widows.</P>
<P>If this Di&s;temper be not timely remedied, it certainly cau&s;es incurable Barrenne&s;s, and the Blood and Juices become more and more depauperated, till a deplorable Con&s;umption, or Drop&s;y <HI>&amp;c.</HI> u&s;hers in Death to end the melancholly Tragedy.</P>
<P>There are few Women, e&s;pecially of the weaker &s;ort, but at one time or other are af|flicted with this Illne&s;s, it being a Di&s;temper often attendant upon, and cau&s;ed by other Di&s;ea&s;es; and whatever Di&s;ea&s;e reduces a
<PB N="40" REF="56">Woman to a languid weakly Frame, it is com|monly &s;ucceeded by this Indi&s;po&s;ition: Thus Women that are naturally of a more weak Habit or Con&s;titution than ordinary, are more &s;ubject to the Whites than others: And as this Illne&s;s is mo&s;tly occa&s;ioned by foregoing Di&s;tempers, (tho' &s;ometimes by &s;udden Frights, violent Exerci&s;e, immode|rate Venery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) &s;o it weakens the Body al&s;o more and more, till the &s;uffering Pati|ent becomes a mi&s;erable Victim to Death, be|ing brought into a hopele&s;s Con&s;umption, Drop&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as afore&s;aid, unle&s;s cured by proper Remedies, admini&s;tred by a Skilful Hand.</P>
<P>But the immediate Cau&s;e of the Whites, is a Weakne&s;s, Laxity or Loo&s;ene&s;s of the Cer|vical Glandules, or Ve&s;&s;els about the Neck of the Womb, who&s;e Tone is either &s;poiled by the ill Con&s;titution of the Stomach and Blood, (depraved by other Di&s;tempers) or by &s;ome of the Accidents, immoderate Ex|erci&s;e. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before mention'd; by which Means, tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els cannot &s;ufficiently re|tain the proper Humour &s;eparated by them from the Blood, to lubricate or moi&s;ten the Neck of the Womb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but let it gleet or &s;lide away in too large a quantity, thereby impoveri&s;hing the Juices of the Body, inevi|tably cau&s;ing Barrenne&s;s, if not timely cured, and bringing the whole humane Frame into a pining de&s;perate State.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="57">
<P>Some Women indeed have this white Flux much more moderate than others, and not continually, but at times only, without cau|&s;ing any great or remarkable Pro&s;tration of Strength, till a Year, or two, or more, after its fir&s;t beginning to appear; but then it be|comes more violent and dangerous, weakning the Body exce&s;&s;ively, and, as it were, at once, and is then much more hard to Cure; this being a known and undoubted Truth, that the longer this Flux of white Matter has af|flicted the Patient, and the larger in quan|tity it is, the longer time will be required, and the more difficult will it be, to accom|pli&s;h the Cure; the Humours being the more habituated to flow that way, and the Tone of the Glandules or Ve&s;&s;els, through which they flow, being the more &s;poiled.</P>
<P>Many Authors write, that if the Whites continue long, they degenerate, and become variou&s;ly Colour'd, as Green, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome times &s;mell intollerably ill; but in all the Women I ever had under my Care for this Illne&s;s, I never could find any &s;uch di&s;co|loured Flux, when there was not rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect another Di&s;ea&s;e, which makes me ab|&s;olutely of the Opinion, that a greeni&s;h Flux is never &s;een, but where it takes its Ri&s;e from a more malignant Di&s;temper, which mu&s;t then be manag'd wholly after a different Manner from the Illne&s;s I here treat of, otherwi&s;e the Patient may be ruined.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="58">
<P>'Tis of great Moment, therefore, carefully to di&s;tingui&s;h the Whites from other Di|&s;tempers that re&s;emble that Malady; for Numbers of Women, who have met with ill Husbands, have labour'd under a Venereal Running, or a Running cau&s;ed by the Foul Di&s;ea&s;e, for &s;ome Years together, &s;till ima|gining it to be only the Whites: Others have mi&s;taken a Running, occa&s;ioned by an Ul|cer in the Womb for that Flux; thus it being very difficult for Women to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e Di&s;tempers, and yet ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould, I think it here very proper to give &s;ome Rules, by which they may a&s;|&s;uredly know one from the other.</P>
<P>The Whites may be certainly di&s;tingui|&s;hed from a Gonorrhaea, or Venereal Run|ning by this: That whenever the Cour&s;es come down, the Whites always cea&s;e, and do not trouble the Patient again till a little while after the Cour&s;es have done flowing; whereas a Venereal Running remains con|&s;tantly upon the Patient, and does not cea&s;e during the Flux of the Terms, but continues all they time they flow, as well as before and after.</P>
<P>The Whites may al&s;o be di&s;tingui&s;hed from an Ulcer in the Womb by this; That an Ulcer in the Womb, is always attended with very &s;harp and gnawing Pains in the Womb, and its Neck, from the very begin|ning of the Di&s;ea&s;e; whereas in the Whites,
<PB N="43" REF="59">tho' &s;ometimes the Humour may be &s;o &s;harp as to cau&s;e Smarting in the outer Parts, yet there is no &s;uch &s;harp Pain felt in tho&s;e in|er Parts.</P>
<P>The Cure of the Whites mu&s;t fir&s;t be en|deavour'd, if Strength will admit, by clean|ing the Stomach and Bowels with Cathar|ticks, and afterwards by rectifying the Blood and Juices, &s;trengthning the Ve&s;&s;els of the Womb, and re&s;toring the weakned Body to its pri&s;tine Vigour, with Alterative, Bal|&s;amick, and Sub-a&s;tringent Medicaments.</P>
<P>The Patient therefore, to prevent the di&s;|mal Effects that may en&s;ue, and entirely to Cure the Whites, if &s;he is not exceeding weak indeed, mu&s;t take a Do&s;e, two, or three as &s;he thinks mo&s;t proper, or finds her &s;elf able to bear, of the Purging Pills pre&s;crib'd in the fir&s;t Chapter of this Book, page 6. a|foregoing, taking them exactly as is there di|rected, excepting only, that in&s;tead of four Pills, &s;he mu&s;t take but three of them for a Do&s;e, the fir&s;t time, becau&s;e Per&s;ons afflicted with the Whites, are commonly much ea&s;ier to be purg'd, than tho&s;e troubled with a Stop|page of the Terms.</P>
<P>Three or Four of tho&s;e Purging Pills will give four, five, or &s;ix Stools, without the lea&s;t Trouble or Di&s;order, neither Griping the Bow|els, or making the Patient &s;ick, but being taken every other, or every third Morning, for two or three times, as Strength will bear,
<PB N="44" REF="60">will admirably clean&s;e the Body of foul Hu|mours, and prepare it for other Remedies to fini&s;h the Cure.</P>
<P>Therefore, as &s;oon as the Patient has pur|ged two or three times, according to her own Di&s;cretion, and as her Con&s;titution will al|low; &s;he mu&s;t the next Day take the quan|tity of a very large Nutmeg of the following Bal&s;amick Electuary every Night and Morn|ing, and at four a Clock every Afternoon al&s;o, not eating any thing an Hour before or after each Do&s;e, but drinking a Gla&s;s of Red Rough W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, or of any &s;trong Wine more agree|able, after it to wa&s;h it down.

<HEAD>No. 11. The Bal&s;amick Electuary.</HEAD>
<P>Take the fine&s;t Dragons Blood, Earth of Japan, Bole-Armoniack, and candid Nut|megs, of each, a Dram and fifteen Grains; Binding Saffron of Steel, a Dram and a half; Pouder of boyl'd Turpentine, four Drams; of my Chymical Balm, a Dram and a half; Syrup of Quinces, a &s;ufficient Quan|tity to make an Electuary according Art.</P>
</FLOATEXT></P>
<P>This Bal&s;amick Electuary mu&s;t be con|&s;tantly taken till the Per&s;on is perfectly cur'd, which will &s;oon be, provided it be taken punctually as directed; in &s;ome the Cure will be accompli&s;hed in a Fortnight, or three Weeks; but in others, who&s;e Illne&s;s is ex|ceeding
<PB N="45" REF="61">bad, it may perhaps be a Month or Six Weeks before it is quite fini&s;hed; but its Sovereign Efficacy may be depended upon, for it will mo&s;t certainly cure, and all Per&s;ons will from the fir&s;t two or three Days, apparently find them&s;elves mend exceedingly all the while they are taking it, which may &s;erve as a Demon&s;tration to them, that by continuing it for a rea&s;onable Time, the Cure will be a&s;&s;uredly compleated.</P>
<P>Therefore, effectually to prevent a Relap&s;e, I advi&s;e every one who begins this Bal&s;amick Electuary, not to leave it off, notwith&s;tanding they may find them&s;elves in Nine Days or a Fortnight pretty well Cured of the Whites, but to continue taking it con&s;tantly as dire|cted, for a Month, five, or &s;ix Weeks, which then will certainly prevent any Return of that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>It never di&s;orders the Body, but commonly keeps it rather loo&s;e than bound, is plea&s;ant to take, and di&s;plays its Virtues a&s;ter an ad|mirable Manner, effectually an&s;wering all the Intentions of Cure; for it &s;trengthens the Stomach and Bowels, purifies the Blood and Juices, re&s;tores the Womb-Ve&s;&s;els to their pri&s;tine Order, by gently &s;traitning and re|ducing them to their natural Tone; it al&s;o wonderfully corroborates the whole Body, taking away all manner of Weakne&s;s in the Back, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> rendring the Patient lively, brisk, healthy and &s;trong, and perfectly putting an
<PB N="46" REF="62">End to that trouble&s;ome Di&s;temper, the Whites.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Patient is under this Cour&s;e, her Food ought to be of very ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, and if &s;he drinks a Gla&s;s or two of Wine at her Meals, it will be the better; &s;he mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, to avoid eating Sallets, Greens, and all &s;orts of Fruit.</P>
<P>If the Patient is troubled with the Head|ach, or is Feveri&s;h, then the Day before &s;he takes any Medicines, it will be highly pro|per for her to bleed in the Arm, to the Quantity of eight or nine Ounces.</P>
<P>If &s;he is exceeding weak, and ill before &s;he begins the&s;e Medicines, then &s;he mu&s;t not take the purging Pills, before recommen|ded, more than once or twice, or not at all, if &s;he thinks &s;he cannot bear Purging, but mu&s;t begin to take the Bal&s;amick Electuary immediately, and continue it con&s;tantly till &s;he is perfectly well, and indeed for a Week or Fortnight afterwards; for it will thereby &s;trengthen the Body to &s;uch a Degree, and confirm the Cure of the Whites in &s;uch a Manner, as re prevent any Relap&s;e into the &s;ame for the future.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Cour&s;es, or any Sign of them approach, and indeed for two or three Days before they are expected, the Bal&s;amick Electuary mu&s;t be le&s;t off, and not be ta|ken again till the Terms have done Flow|ing.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="63">
<P>Some Women that are very &s;ubject to be Co&s;tive, may happen to be bound in their Bodies, while they are taking the Bal&s;amick Electuary, (tho' it mo&s;t commonly proves otherwi&s;e) in which Ca&s;e, the Patient may take a Do&s;e of the Laxative Electuary, re|commended in the &s;econd Chapter of this Book, Page 17. a foregoing, as is there dire|cted, &s;o as ju&s;t to loo&s;en her Belly, but not more, ob&s;erving only, to omit taking the Bal|&s;amick Electuary that Day the Laxative One is taken.</P>
<P>If the Patient troubled with the Whites, labours at the &s;ame time under any Di&s;order of the Cour&s;es, it will be proper for her fir&s;t to get Cured of that Di&s;order, as directed in the foregoing Chapters, before &s;he attempts the Cure of the Whites; as for Example, &s;uppo&s;e a Woman &s;hould be afflicted with a Deficiency of the Terms, or their flowing but &s;paringly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with the Whites al&s;o, which frequently happens, &s;he mu&s;t then fir&s;t Cure her &s;elf of the Deficiency of the Cour&s;es, by taking the Opening Pouder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pre&s;cri|bed in the fir&s;t Chapter of this Book, p. 7. Exactly as there directed, and when by that Means her Terms flow regularly, and well, and are of a good Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then &s;he ought to begin the Remedies pre&s;cribed in this Chapter, for the Cure of the Whites, but not before.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="64">
<P>I could give almo&s;t innumerable In&s;tances of Per&s;ons cured of the Whites, by the Me|thod and Medicines above de&s;cribed, but &s;hall only relate one or two Ca&s;es, the Parti|culars of which I believe will prove accepta|ble to my Readers.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent for about &s;even Months &s;ince to a young Gentlewoman about Nineteen Years of Age, who for three Years before, as I was informed, had at times been troub|led with this white Flux, but it not continu|ing con&s;tantly upon her, nor flowing vio|lently, neither her &s;elf or Mother much mind|ed it, till at la&s;t growing very bad, the Whites increa&s;ing in Quantity, her Legs &s;welling, and her whole Body becoming more and more di&s;order'd, they thought proper to &s;eek for Help.</P>
<P>I found her in great Di&s;tre&s;s, her Back much pained, her Appetite almo&s;t lo&s;t, her Legs a little &s;well'd, and the Flux (by her Mother's Relation) very &s;evere, yet &s;he was not exceeding feveri&s;h, therefore, I did not think fit to have her blooded, but order'd her to take two Do&s;es of my Purging Pills before mention'd, at two Days di&s;tance from each other: They operated very well, took down the Swelling of her Legs, and made her &s;omething better; However, being a little weakned, I did not order her to purge again, but directed her the next
<PB N="49" REF="65">Day to take my Bal&s;amick Electuary as above, and continue it con&s;tantly till &s;he was cured.</P>
<P>In about fourteen Days the Flux was &s;o much abated, as hardly to be perceived, the Pain in her Back was nearly gone, and &s;he be|gan to look brisk and recover Strength; but being always much &s;ubject to Co&s;tivene&s;s, &s;he was &s;omething bound in her Body. I there|fore order'd her the Day following to take a Do&s;e of my Laxative Electuary before menti|oned, ju&s;t to loo&s;en her Bowels, and if &s;he found any further occa&s;ion, to take a Do&s;e of it every five Days, and the Bal&s;amick Electuary con&s;tantly the other Days, which &s;he did, for a Fortnight longer, in which time &s;he was per|fectly cured, and has remained in compleat Health ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Near &s;ix Months ago a Gentlewomen of about thirty Years of Age &s;ent for me, and de&s;ired my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he being exceedingly afflicted with the Whites, which &s;he had been troubled with upwards of four Years: That Illne&s;s began quickly after a Mi&s;carriage, which had like to have proved her Death, and which was occa&s;ioned by a great Fright.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he had taken abundance of Medicines, fir&s;t by the Advice of her Mid|wife, and an eminent Apothecary, and af|terwards by the Direction of a Phy&s;ician of good Note, without receiving any Benefit; and added, that &s;he feared there was no Cure for her, but that &s;he mu&s;t dye, yet de&s;ired
<PB N="50" REF="66">I would do all in my Power, and &s;ave her Life, if po&s;&s;ible, for her Children's Sake, &s;he having three alive.</P>
<P>Her Ca&s;e was exceeding bad indeed; &s;he was very ill and weak, &s;carce able to &s;tir, had a violent Pain in her Head and Back, no Ap|petite to Food, was frequently very feve|ri&s;h, and almo&s;t wore to a Skeleton by the great Flux of white Matter that &s;he had &s;o long labour'd under, neverthele&s;s I let her know, that with the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Almigh|ty, I did not doubt but to re&s;tore her to Health, provided &s;he would follow my Di|rections, and take my Medicines punctually, which &s;he readily promi&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>This Gentlewoman was too weak to bear Purging, therefore I forbore ordering her my Purging Pills; but con&s;idering the great Pain in her Head, and that &s;he was inclined to be feveri&s;h, I directed her, fir&s;t, to have about eight Ounces of Blood taken from her Arm, which without weakning her, diverted the Humours, and prevented a Fever, which might otherwi&s;e have happen'd, and the next Day, I ordered her to begin my Bal&s;a|mick Electuary, and continue it con&s;tantly, as directed in this Chapter,</P>
<P>At the End of Five Days, I found her mightily recover'd, the Whites being nearly &s;topt, her Spirits revived, her Strength much encreasd, the Pain in her Head and Back almo&s;t entirely gone, and her Appetite in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure
<PB N="51" REF="67">come to her: However, &s;he being &s;ome|thing hot and unea&s;y by turns, and not hav|ing purged at fir&s;t, becau&s;e of her exceeding Weakne&s;s, I advi&s;ed her: though &s;he was not in the lea&s;t Co&s;tive, to take a Do&s;e of my Laxative Electuary, once every Five or Six Days, and the Bal&s;amick Electuary the other Days, as before, and to continue that Cour&s;e till &s;he was perfectly well, and for Nine or Ten Days after.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he took my Advice, and in a Month from the Time &s;he fir&s;t began my Medicines, &s;he left off taking them, having been well for about a Week before, and was then, and &s;till remains in perfect Health and Strength, to the Admiration of all that knew her.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Bownfalling of the Womb and Fundament.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is vulgarly call'd the Down|falling of the Womb, is in Reallity no &s;uch Thing, for there can be no Out-hang|ing of That, without pre&s;ent Death; but the Di&s;order commonly known by that Name, is an Out-hanging of the Vagina, or outer Neck of the Womb, and is truly only the
<PB N="52" REF="68">Wrinkles of the Sheath, or Pa&s;&s;age relaxed and &s;woln, &s;o as to fall cut and appear, &s;ome|thing like a Ball with a Hole in the Middle: It is generally very painful and trouble&s;ome, and &s;ometimes &s;o much inflamed, as to threat|en a Gangrene.</P>
<P>This Indi&s;po&s;ition is cau&s;ed by &s;training or irritating the Secret Parts, by hard Labour in Child-bearing, by the Hand of an unskilful Midwife, by exce&s;&s;ive Venery, or immoderate Exerci&s;e, as hard Riding, Dancing, Leaping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or by a violent Flux, either of the Whites or Cour&s;es, which often not only re|laxes, or loo&s;ens the Vagina, but al&s;o frets or irritates it &s;o, as to cau&s;e it to become &s;ore, &s;well and hang down.</P>
<P>The Falling down of the Fundament is an Out hanging of the Inte&s;tinum Rectum, or great Gut, and is cau&s;ed by Weakne&s;s and Relaxation of its Fibres, or tearing of them, either by &s;evere Co&s;tivene&s;s, violent &s;training in hard Labour, or &s;harp Loo&s;ene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not only trouble&s;ome but dangerous, if not quickly remedied, and oftentimes becomes the Seat of a foul Ulcer or Fi&s;tula.</P>
<P>In the Cure of the&s;e Illne&s;&s;es, the Medi|cines that we give inwardly, mu&s;t be Vulne|rary, and &s;uch as will endue the Blood and Juices with a Bal&s;amick Property, in order to &s;trengthen and create an Aptne&s;s in the relaxed Fibres, and &s;woln Parts to recover their Tone, and retain their natural Station,
<PB N="53" REF="69">when reduced, or gently put up, after peculiar Emollient, and moderately A&s;tringent Fomen|tations have been externally applied.</P>
<P>If the Patient is co&s;tive, particular Care mu&s;t be had to remove that Di&s;order, for &s;training at going to Stool is not only painful, but increa&s;es the Malady, as well that of fal|ling down of the Womb, as the falling down of the Fundament.</P>
<P>If the Part hanging down is inflamed or angry, Bleeding in the Arm will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, after which, in order certainly to cure the&s;e Indi&s;po&s;itions, the Parts affected mu&s;t be bathed outwardly with my &s;anative Fomentation, which is thus made.
<FLOATEXT LANG="eng" TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>No. 12. The Sanative Fomentation.</HEAD>
<P>Take of Pomegranate Peel, two Drams; dried red Ro&s;es, Pomegranate Flowers, of each half an handful; Oak Bark, half an Ounce; boil them in a Quart of Spring Water, till it comes to a Pint, which then &s;train out, and while it is very hot, add Sugar of Lead, white Vitriol, and my healing Salt, of each one Dram; &s;tir it about till the Salts are di&s;&s;olved, and when cold, add of common Spirit of Wine, two Ounces; which mix well, and re&s;erve the whole for u&s;e.</P>
</FLOATEXT></P>
<P>This Sanative Fomentation mu&s;t be u&s;ed thus; Pour a little of it into a well glaz'd
<PB N="54" REF="70">Pipkin, or other Earthen Ve&s;&s;el, and make it very hot over the Fire, then with a fine Flan|nel Cloth dipt into it, bathe and foment there|with the Part hanging out, either of the Fundament or Womb, as hot as can be well endured, for a quarter or half an Hour toge|ther; after which, the Patient lying down, let the Part be gently put up by a tender Hand, and kept in its Place by a Tru&s;s, or conveni|ent Bands of Linnen Cloth, minding to bathe tho&s;e Parts two or three times every Day in the &s;ame manner, for five or &s;ix Days together, though the Part does not fall out again.</P>
<P>By the u&s;e of this Fomentation alone, with|out taking Medicines inwardly, the falling down of the Womb will be a&s;&s;uredly cured; but in the falling down of the Fundament, e&s;pecially if it be through great Weakne&s;s, it will be very nece&s;&s;ary for the Patient, be|&s;ides bathing the Part affected with the Sa|native Fomentation, to take at the &s;ame time the Bal&s;amick Electuary pre&s;cribed in the fore|going Chapter, <HI>Page</HI> 44. as is there directed, and it will wonderfully &s;trengthen the Parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whil&s;t the Sanative Fomentation u&s;ed outwardly, will abate the Swelling, heal all Sorene&s;s, cau&s;e the relaxed Fibres to regain their Tone, and keep the Part affected in its Natural Situation.</P>
<P>But if the Patient is Co&s;tive and the Bal|&s;amick Electuary &s;hould not cau&s;e loo&s;e Stools, as it generally will, then the Lax|ative
<PB N="55" REF="71">Electuary, pre&s;cribed in the &s;econd Chapter, Page 17. aforegoing, mu&s;t be taken, as there directed, in a Morning Fa&s;ting, every third, fourth or fifth Day, as the Patient finds needful; taking &s;uch a Do&s;e of it as will ju&s;t give two or three loo&s;e Stools, but not more, and minding to omit the Bal&s;amick Electuary that Day the Laxative One is taken.</P>
<P>It will be convenient al&s;o for tho&s;e troubled with the down falling of the Womb, if they are Co&s;tive, to take the Laxative Electuary in like manner.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e Directions being punctually followed, the falling down of the Womb, (as it is vulgarly called) and al&s;o of the Funda|ment, will be certainly and effectually Cured.</P>

<P>AS being the Mother of Children is the highe&s;t Honour, and mo&s;t exalted State of Satisfaction, that the Fair Sex can attain to in a Married Life; &s;o on the contrary Barrenne&s;s, of all other Misfortunes is by much the greate&s;t, producing the mo&s;t &s;evere Affliction that can attend a Family, and cau&s;ing the deepe&s;t &s;ecret Grief in a Wo|man that is po&s;&s;ible to be imagined: What Di&s;cord?

<P>And the more u&s;eful will it &s;till appear, when we con&s;ider that the Natural Excel|lent Mode&s;ty of our Women, hinder them from openly &s;eeking for a Cure of that un|fortunate Circum&s;tance, which, by means of the plain mode&s;t Account I intend to give, may be &s;ecretly remedied by them&s;elves with|out the Knowledge of others.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="73">
<P>It is to be under&s;tood here, that I mean to write only of the Cau&s;e and Cure of Barrenne&s;s in Women of &s;uitable Years, and not in tho&s;e who are either too old, or too young; in the former, when their Terms have left them, Conception is impo&s;&s;ible, and the latter mu&s;t contentedly wait, till Age has ripen'd, and made them capable of Child-bearing; for &s;ome Women there are, who being Married very young, Conceive not till they are Nineteen, Twenty or Twen|ty two or three Years of Age, or more, and then become very Fruitful; and others that. Marrying betimes have Children at Four|teen or Fifteen: Thus there is a very re|markable and manife&s;t Difference in the Na|ture and Ripene&s;s of the Female Sex. This being premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;hew the &s;everal Cau&s;es of Barrenne&s;s, and here by the way I cannot pa&s;s by, what with Concern I have often ob&s;erved, <HI>viz.</HI> That many likely Women have been deemed incurably Barren, lived uncomfortably many Years, and at la&s;t gone out of the World without bearing Children, for want only of their Phy&s;ician's having a true Knowledge of the &s;eemingly unaccoun|table Cau&s;e, which in all probability might have been ea&s;ily removed by a proper Method and fit Medicines, and the Women have been rendered as capable of having Chil|dren as any whatever; but to proceed.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="74">
<P>The Cau&s;es of Barrenne&s;s are many, as the vi&s;ible ill Structure or Formation of the Parts, exceeding Fatne&s;s, Scirrhous Tu|mours or Swellings in the Neck of the Womb, Ulcers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all which Ca&s;es there cannot be a regular Admi&s;&s;ion of the Male Seed, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible a Conception &s;hould happen; but as the&s;e Cau&s;es are &s;el|dom &s;een, and as rarely Cured, I &s;hall not enlarge upon them. Other Cau&s;es of Bar|renne&s;s are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Deficiency of the Monthly Terms, and then the Natural Ferment of the Blood and Juices is wanting, the lively, de&s;irous Faculty is &s;poiled, neither is the Womb fit to receive the Spirituous Effluvia of the Ma&s;|culine Seed that a Conception might follow.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The immoderate Flux of the Cour&s;es, which impoveri&s;hes the Fluids, weakens the whole Body, and thereby incapacitates a Woman to Conceive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The Whites, Slipperine&s;s, or over Moi&s;tne&s;s of the Womb, which weaken it and its Ve&s;&s;els, plainly prevent Conception, by conden&s;ing or drowning, as it were, the Vital Spirits of the Male Seed, and by that means cau&s;ing Sterility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Swelling of the Vagina, or Wrinkles of the Privities, &s;o as to hang out of the Body, vulgarly called the Down|falling of the Womb, which then hinders Enjoyment.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<PB N="59" REF="75">
<P>But there are yet other Cau&s;es of barren|ne&s;s, that are not vi&s;ible, the Women be|ing in perfect Health, Young, Brisk, Jolly, and as likely to have Children to all Ap|pearance, and as they them&s;elves believe, as any in the World, and by rea&s;on the Cau&s;es of Sterility in &s;uch Women do not immediately appear, the Vulgar Practitio|ners call them occult, or unknown, and indeed are &s;o to them; but to an Ingenious Phy&s;ician, who makes Nature his Study, is expert in Anatomy, and who carefully &s;earches into the Ab&s;tru&s;e Principles and Cau&s;es of Things, to &s;uch, the&s;e pretended occult Cau&s;es are well known, ea&s;ily account|ed for, and quickly removed, and which I will unfold.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to explain and fully lay open what may other|wi&s;e appear intricate, to Women and others in treating of the&s;e Cau&s;es, to &s;hew the Nature of Generation, and how a Foetus is produced.</P>
<P>Within the Body of a Woman, on each &s;ide the outer Part of the Bottom of the Womb, at about eight Fingers Breadth di|&s;tance from it, are &s;ituated the Ovaria, &s;o named from their Likene&s;s to the Collection of little Eggs found in the Bodies of Fowl; the&s;e Ovaria are of an Oval Figure, a little flat on their upper Part, and about half as big as a Man's Te&s;ticles, and are vulgarly called Te&s;ticles or Stones.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="76">
<P>In the Ovaria there are &s;everal little Ova or Eggs, almo&s;t like Bladders, contain'd in proper &s;eparate Cells, one of which Eggs in the time of Coition is foecundated or im|pregnated by the Spirituous Part or Efflu|vium of the Male Seed ca&s;t to the Womb, which Spirit or Effluvium a&s;cends from thence to the Ovaria through the Ve&s;&s;els called Womb Trumpets, which are about four or five Fingers breadth long, and ari&s;e on each &s;ide from the Bottom of the Womb; the upper Part of the&s;e Womb Trumpets, being wide and open, embrace the Ovaria in the time of Enjoyment, and dilate or open &s;o as to give free Pa&s;&s;age to the Ef|fluvium, or Spirit of the Ma&s;culine Seed ca&s;t to the Womb, that it may in&s;tant|ly arrive at the Ovaria, where it &s;timu|lates, acts upon, and impregnates one of the little Ova or Eggs therein contain'd, as before mentioned; which then falls from its Cell, through one of the Womb Trum|pets, into the Womb, as a proper Place a&s;&s;igned by Nature for its Reception; where it is nouri&s;hed, grows bigger, and becomes a Foetus.</P>
<P>If two or more of the&s;e little Eggs hap|pen to be foecundated, or impregnated at the &s;ame time, the Woman then has Twins, or &s;everal Children at a Birth, as is often &s;een.</P>
<P>The falling of one of the little Eggs from its Cell in the Ovaria, through one of the
<PB N="61" REF="77">Womb Trumpets, into the Womb, often oc|ca&s;ions an uncommon Sen&s;ation and gentle &s;hivering of the Body after the Conjugal Act, which is therefore a Sign of Conception; it al&s;o cau&s;es a Contraction of the inner Neck or Mouth of the Womb, &s;o as perfectly to clo&s;e it, in order to retain the Egg in the Womb, and prevent its &s;lipping away, till at the end of nine Months, the time allotted for its Perfection and Birth, it is become Ripe for Expul&s;ion, and fit to live in the open Air.</P>
<P>And thus Conception is cau&s;ed, and not by the fancied, true and equal mixture of Male and Female Seed, as was the Notion of the Ancients; for Women have no &s;uch thing as Seed other than the Ovaria, vulgarly called Te&s;ticles, before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Indeed in the time of Coition mo&s;t Wo|men void a white limpid Humour, which having &s;ome re&s;emblance to Seed, might help to occa&s;ion the Mi&s;take of the Ancients; but modern Di&s;coveries demon&s;trate, that this white Liquor comes from the &s;mall Pores of the Vagina celled Lacunae, and not from the Womb, neither in the time of Carnal Conjunction does it go into the Womb, which is a plain Proof that it is not Seed, but that it is only de&s;igned by Nature to create De&s;ire in Women, lubricate the Pa&s;&s;age to the Womb, and to cau&s;e exceed|ing Plea&s;ure in the Conjugal Act.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="78">
<P>Now it mu&s;t be allow'd, that it is mo&s;t likely a Woman &s;hould Conceive at the Moment this white Liqour is voided, pro|vided the Male Seed is at that in&s;tant emit|ted al&s;o, becau&s;e then the Woman feels ex|ce&s;&s;ive Delight, which occa&s;ions the Mouth of the Womb to open and receive the Spi|rituous Part of the Ma&s;culine Seed, the Womb Trumpets al&s;o dilate or widen to &s;uch a degree, as to give Pa&s;&s;age to the lit|tle Egg, which when impregnated falls from its Cell in the Ovaria, through one of them into the Womb, as before taught.</P>
<P>And thus having di&s;cover'd how Gene|ration and Conception happens, I &s;hall pro|ceed to treat of the Cau&s;es of Barrenne&s;s, which do not plainly appear, and are not known to Women them&s;elves, which now from what follows may be ea&s;ily conceived by Per&s;ons of tollerable Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;es then that hinder Conception in Women of &s;uitable Years, brisk, and not labouring under any Apparent Weak|ne&s;s or Indi&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t be either an Ob|&s;truction of the Womb Trumpets, which then hinders the Spirituous Part of the Ma&s;|culine Seed from pa&s;&s;ing through them to the Ovaria, without which Impregnation or Conception cannot happen; or from the Faultine&s;s of the Ova or Eggs contain'd in the Ovaria, &s;o as they are uncapable of be|ing impregnated by the Vital Effluvia of the
<PB N="63" REF="79">Male Seed, that Conception might follow; or el&s;e from an inappitency to Matrimonial Plea&s;ure in general, which la&s;t is common to Women of a Cold Con&s;titution, in whom the Spirits flow not to the lower Parts, they feel no Plea&s;ure in Coition, the Womb con|tracts, its inner Neck clo&s;es, and for want of warm De&s;ires in the mind, gives not, but refu&s;es a &s;uitable Reception to the Effluvia of the Male Seed, and &s;o ab&s;olutely hinders Conception.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;hewn the Cau&s;es of Barren|ne&s;s, as well tho&s;e that are deemed occult, or unknown, as tho&s;e that are obvious to common Practitioners and Women them|&s;elves, I &s;hall in the next Place point out the true and direct method of Cure.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, if Conception be hindred by Di&s;ea&s;es, as the Deficiency or want of the Cour&s;es, immoderate flowing of the Terms, the Whites, Slipperine&s;s of the Womb, out|hanging or bearing down of the &s;well'd Va|gina, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then recour&s;e mu&s;t be immediately had to the method and Medicines appointed for their Cure, under their proper Heads in the 'foregoing Chapters, and when the Patient is thereby brought into good Order, has her Cour&s;es regular, and her Body is in an apparent, healthy State, then, if &s;he does not quickly Conceive, mu&s;t be admi|ni&s;tred proper Uterine Medicines, Cordial and Strengthning, and which have a peculiar
<PB N="64" REF="80">Faculty to prepare, fortify and invigorate the Parts appropriated to Generation, and make a Woman Prolifick, of which Nature are the Medicaments I &s;hall by and by pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Now when Barrenne&s;s proceeds from Ob|&s;truction or Stoppage of the Womb Trum|pets, or from the Faultine&s;s of the Ova or Eggs in the Ovaria, (which Cau&s;es) do not ap|pear otherwi&s;e than in their Effect) or from defect or want of convenient Amorous De&s;ire, then, and in all the&s;e Ca&s;es, Endeavours mu&s;t be u&s;ed to attenuate the Blood and Juices, rou&s;e and encrea&s;e the Animal Spirits, cau&s;e them to act with Ardour, to revive the whole Humane Frame, and create Mirth, and particularly to rectify all Di&s;orders of the Genital Parts, by &s;uch Salubrious Medicines, as are &s;pecificated to open Ob&s;tructions of the Womb Trumpets, and at the &s;ame time adapted to comfort and &s;trengthen the whole Body, nouri&s;h, encrea&s;e and fill the Ova or Eggs in the Ovaria, make them apt and ready to be foecundated or im|pregnated and al&s;o to correct and drive away the Saturnine Habit, and all &s;upper|fluous, cold, moi&s;t Humours, which deaden De&s;ires to Matrimonial Plea&s;ure, and there|by de&s;troy even the very intent of that Di|vine In&s;titution, &s;uch Medicines I &s;ay mu&s;t be given, as will repleni&s;h the Blood and Juices, and revive an Inclination to Con|jugal Enjoyment, &s;o that it may no more be
<PB N="65" REF="81">burden&s;ome, as it is to &s;ome Women, but &s;ui|tably acceptable, that thereby happy I&s;&s;ue may be the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place therefore, tho&s;e who have rea&s;on to believe their not Conceiving proceeds from the 'foremention'd, occult, unknown, or not apparent Cau&s;es, mu&s;t take the following Prolifick Elixir, which will open any Stoppage or Ob&s;truction of the Womb Trumpets, fit and prepare the Ova or Eggs for Impregnation, rectify the Blood and Juices, and correct all Vicious Qualities thereof.

<P>While I was writing this Chapter, a Gen|tleman came to return me Thanks and Gra|tify me for the Service I had done his Lady.

<PB N="70" REF="86">of my Prolifick Elixir (which I believed would render her Fruitful) with Direction for her to take it for a Fortnight or three Weeks con&s;tantly, as I have order'd in this Chapter, which he per&s;uaded her to, and &s;he Conceived quickly after, being now, to her great Joy, as well as her Husband's, a|bove four Months gone with Child.</P>
<P>Another Gentleman (near three Quarters of a Year &s;ince) let me know, that he had been Married pear &s;even Years without having Children, and that his Wife, being of a Cold Con&s;titution, he believed that was the Cau&s;e of her not Conceiving, which was my Opinion al&s;o.

<P>AS there is nothing more unplea&s;ing than to be di&s;appointed of expected and wi&s;h'd for I&s;&s;ue, through Mi&s;carriage, &s;o nothing proves more dangerous to the Female Sex, than that unhappy misfortune; for it being Unnatural, is always attended with ill Symptoms, and proves much wor&s;e than a regular Child-birth: And tho' a Wo|man recovers the immediate Danger of lo|&s;ing her Life by a Mi&s;carriage, yet if &s;he is frequently afflicted in the &s;ame manner, it certainly ruins her Con&s;titution, weakens the whole Body, brings on incurable Illne&s;&s;es, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;hortens Life.</P>
<P>And it is a Grievance that often becomes habitual to the Fair Sex, many Women Mi&s;carrying five or &s;ix, and &s;ome, ten or twelve times following one another, exactly at a certain Length of Time after Concep|tion: Thus Mi&s;carriage happens, to &s;ome
<PB N="72" REF="88">always in the third Month of their going with Child, to others in the fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, &s;eventh or eighth, and then it is much more dangerous than in the fir&s;t two or three Months.</P>
<P>The oftner a Woman has mi&s;carried, the more difficult will it be to cau&s;e her to re|tain the Fruit of her Womb, the whole nine Months that Divine Providence has appoint|ed, for ripening a Natural Birth; for when a Woman is accu&s;tom'd to mi&s;carry, the Womb at the u&s;ual time endeavours with its utmo&s;t Efforts to eject its Burden.</P>
<P>Mi&s;carriage is commonly cau&s;ed the fir&s;t time by a &s;udden Fright, violent Blow, or Fall, or longing for Things &s;een without having them, either of which, cau&s;es a con|traction of the Womb, and a kind of Con|vul&s;ive Motion, &s;o as to expel the Foetus. In a word, whatever irritates the Womb, and excites the Expul&s;ive, and weakens the Retentive Faculty, procures Mi&s;carriage; &s;o that a great Cold, immoderate Exerci&s;e, intemperate Eating, Drinking too much Wine in the fir&s;t Months, exce&s;&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ion, either of Anger, Joy, Fear, Grief, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or di&s;order of the Kidneys, or of the Bowels, the redundancy and rarefaction of the Blood, flaggine&s;s of the Womb, want of Spirits through prodigious Bleedings, al&s;o vehement Coughing, Sneezing, or Vomiting, may oc|ca&s;ion this great Unhappine&s;s.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="89">
<P>The imminent Symptoms that threaten immediate Mi&s;carriage, are an heavine&s;s and weight about the Loins, a bearing down of the Womb, Pain of the Back, and Pains from the Navel downwards, al&s;o trembling, pal|pitation of the Heart, &s;hivering, inappetency, lazine&s;s, flaggine&s;s of the Brea&s;ts, flux of Matter from the Womb, <HI>&amp;c</HI> all, or any of which, portend Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>If there is Rea&s;on to believe, that the Foetus is already &s;eparated from the Womb, the Expul&s;ion of it mu&s;t not be hindred, but, on the contrary, be promoted as much as may be, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Skilful Midwife or Phy&s;ician practi&s;ing that Art; and &s;uch Remedies mu&s;t be given as will ha&s;ten its Expul&s;ion, and by their forcing Quality, &s;peedily Ea&s;e the Womb of its then dangerous Burden; for which end I recom|mend the following Expul&s;ive Cordial, a Spoonful or two of which, the Patient mu&s;t take every now and then, fir&s;t &s;haking the Bottle, and it will cau&s;e the Womb to ex|pel the Foetus or Child, tho' Dead, with admirable and unexpected Ea&s;e.</P>

<P>Take Bryony Water Compound, Treacle Wa|ter, and, &s;trong Cinnamon Water, of each half an Ounce; Baum Water, and Chamo|mile Water, of each one Ounce; Mugwort Water, and Penny royal Water, of each two Ounces and an half; Te&s;ticles of an Hor&s;e prepared, four Scruples; Tincture of Ca&s;tor, two Drams; Tincture of Saffron, one Dram; Spirit of Salt Armoniack, two Scruples; Salt of Amber, one Scruple; Chymical Oil of Savin, Oil of Ani&s;eeds, and Oil of Chamomile (fir&s;t mixt with a little white Pouder Sugar) of each three Drops; of my forcing Salt, two Scruples; Syrup of Mugwort, one Ounce and an half; mix and make a Cordial according to Art.</P>
</FLOATEXT></P>
<P>This Expul&s;ive Cordial has excellent Ef|fects in the afore-mention'd Ca&s;es, and is truly the mo&s;t proper Medicine in the World to remedy a hard or &s;low Labour; for it is not only powerfully forcing, but al&s;o ea&s;es and comforts the Woman, &s;trengthens the Child, and di&s;po&s;es the Womb to expel its Burden with ea&s;e and &s;afety, provided the Child is in a right Po&s;ture, and fit to be ex|pell'd, which an Ingenious Midwife may pre&s;ently know; for if it be not, that and all other forcing Medicines will do more
<PB N="75" REF="91">hurt than good, and prove dangerous, and therefore mu&s;t be avoided, till by the Hand of a Skilful Midwife the Birth is made to pre&s;ent right, and then the Expul&s;ive Cor|dial being given as before directed, will &s;oon di&s;play its wonderful Efficacy, and &s;peedily cau&s;e an happy Delivery.</P>
<P>And if after Delivery, the Lochia or Child|bed Purgations doe not come down regu|larly, then a Spoonful or two of the Expul|&s;ive Cordial, being given to the Patient ac|cording to the Di&s;cretion of her Midwife, will prove very &s;erviceable, and bring down the Flux freely.</P>
<P>But to return to Mi&s;carriage: If the Foetus or Child be not &s;eparated, nor the Blood Ve&s;|&s;els broke, Endeavours, by all po&s;&s;ible means, mu&s;t then be u&s;ed to confirm the Tone of the Ligaments, &s;trengthen the Womb, and corroborate the Foetus; for which purpo&s;e &s;uch Medicines mu&s;t be immediately given, as are Comforting, Bal&s;amick, Sub-a&s;tringent, Temperate in re&s;pect to Heat, and that have a Power to ab&s;orb all irritating or &s;harp Hu|mours, which often cau&s;e a Contraction of the Womb and Expul&s;ion of the Birth.</P>
<P>Therefore if a Woman has, never mi&s;car|ried, but, being with Child, is frightned, or receives a Blow, Fall, <HI>&amp;c</HI> &s;o as to endanger a Mi&s;carriage, I advi&s;e her, in&s;tantly to drink a Gla&s;s, two, or more of &s;trong <HI>Florence</HI> or <HI>Barabar</HI> Claret, there being nothing better
<PB N="76" REF="92">on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions; for it recovers and rai&s;es the Spirits depre&s;&s;ed by Frights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the &s;ame time by its Noble A&s;trin|gent Quality, &s;trengthens the Womb and its Ve&s;&s;els; Burnt-Claret may al&s;o be drank to good Effect: After which, if any Symp|toms of Mi&s;carrying continue; the Patient mu&s;t take from the Point of a Knife, the quantity of a large Nutmeg of my Specifick Electuary, pre&s;cribed for the immoderate Flux of the Cour&s;es in the &s;econd Chapter of this Book, Page 19. a foregoing, as &s;oon as can be, and continue to take the &s;ame quantity of it three times every Day, <HI>viz.</HI> every Night and Morning, and at three or four a Clock every Afternoon, till all dan|ger of Mi&s;carrying is over, minding to drink a Gla&s;s of the aforemention'd Wine or other agreeable Liquor after each Do&s;e, and it will a&s;&s;uredly prevent Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>But if the Patient has Mi&s;carried once, or &s;everal times before, then it will be highly nece&s;&s;ary for her to begin to take the Spe|cifick Electuary, as before directed, a Week or more, before the la&s;t or u&s;ual time of her Mi&s;carrying, and continue it till a Week or Fortnight after the time &s;he mo&s;t fears, tho' &s;he has no Symptoms of Mi&s;carrying, by which means &s;he will certainly prevent that misfortune, tho' &s;he has mi&s;carried many times before.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="93">
<P>For it powerfully corroborates the Womb and its Ve&s;&s;els, confirms and e&s;tabli&s;hes the Tone of the Ligaments that keep the Birth fixed to the Womb, and &s;trengthens the Foetus more than can be expre&s;&s;ed; it al&s;o comforts the Stomach and Bowels, ab&s;orbs all acrid or &s;harp Humours, and fortifies the Spirits exceedingly: Therefore the lon|ger it is taken, during a Woman is with Child, the more &s;ecure will &s;he be of going out her whole Time with &s;afety, ea&s;e and health; yet about the la&s;t Month of her Time, if no danger of Mi&s;carrying appears, it will be proper for her to leave taking it, becau&s;e it &s;trengthens the Membranes, Liga|ments, and Ve&s;&s;els &s;o exceedingly, that be|ing taken too near the Time of Delivery, it may po&s;&s;ibly cau&s;e her Labour to be &s;ome|thing more hard than otherwi&s;e it would.</P>
<P>If after a Woman is brought to Bed, the Lochia or Child-bed Purgations &s;hould flow violently, &s;o as to make it nece&s;&s;ary to re|&s;train the Flux, then a few Do&s;es of the Specifick Electuary, being given to the Pati|ent by Advice of her Midwife, will do infi|nite Good.</P>
<P>If the Patient, during the time of taking the Specifick Electuary, to prevent her Mi&s;|carrying, &s;hould happen to he Co&s;tive, or very hard Bound, then it will be nece&s;&s;ary for her to take &s;ome very gentle Medicine, ju&s;t to loo&s;en her Belly every now and then, as
<PB N="78" REF="94">&s;he finds occa&s;ion, for which purpo&s;e a &s;mall Do&s;e of the Laxative Electuary pre&s;crib'd in this Book, Page 17. aforegoing, being taken, will prove very proper.</P>
<P>If the Symptoms of Mi&s;carriage are occa|&s;ioned by longing for Things &s;een, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what|ever they be, they ought immediately to be procured, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>And if the Patient is of a Sanguine Com|plexion, and full of Blood, it will not be ami&s;s for her to be pre&s;ently blooded to the quantity of eight Ounces.</P>
<P>Thus I have given all the nece&s;&s;ary Dire|ctions concerning Mi&s;carriage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which being duly followed, will certainly have the de&s;ired Effect; as the number of Women I have cured of the Habit of Mi&s;carrying, by the Method herein &s;et down, evinces.</P>
<P>About two Years ago, a Gentlewoman near thirty Years of Age came to me much afflicted, having mi&s;carried ten times before, and always about the third Month; &s;he was very de&s;irous to be cured of that Faculty, and was then about nine or tea Weeks gone with Child, and began to have &s;ome Symp|toms of approaching Mi&s;carriage, I there|fore order'd her to take my Specifick Elect|uary, as I have directed in this Chapter, and to continue it constantly for &s;ix Weeks at lea&s;t, which &s;he did, and without taking any think el&s;e, &s;he was cured, went out her whole Time, and brought into the
<PB N="79" REF="95">World a healthy Boy; and &s;o compleat was the Cure, that &s;ince that, &s;he has had ano|ther Child, without taking any Medicines, or having the lea&s;t &s;ign or fear of Mi&s;car|riage.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> It being a common thing for Women who are afflicted with Illne&s;s to leave off taking Medicines, after the wor&s;t Symp|toms of their Indi&s;po&s;itions are taken off, and before they are perfectly Cured, I could not here omit advi&s;ing them, to a|void that Practice, and to keep to the Cour&s;e of Medicines that they enter into, regularly, for the whole time they are di|rected, otherwi&s;e they cannot expect le&s;s than to relap&s;e into their Di&s;ea&s;es again, which will then give them double Trouble, increa&s;e the Expence, and prove more difficult to Cure.</P>
