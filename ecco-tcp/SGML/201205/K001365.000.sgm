<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE Bite of a Mad Dog, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Know not of any human attempt which bears a better re&s;emblance to the knight of La Mancha's attack of a wind-mill, than that of combating vulgar errors; of rea&s;oning again&s;t received opi|nions. The mo&s;t powerful and pointed arguments generally fall to the ground, when oppo&s;ed by the impenetrable &s;hield of common prejudice. Neverthele&s;s, in the pre&s;ent age, when &s;cience is hourly making &s;uch rapid advances towards the di&s;covery of truth; when knowledge is &s;o much more univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed than in
<PB N="2" REF="4">former times, it &s;eems not unrea&s;onable to hope, that mankind may be per&s;uaded to be&s;tow a few moments unbia&s;&s;ed atten|tion on a &s;ubject confe&s;&s;edly of the highe&s;t medical importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;ubject hath indeed been amply and learnedly treated by ancient and mo|dern phy&s;icians, in various countries and languages; in this kingdom particularly, by the celebrated Dr. Mead, and the no le&s;s famous Dr. James; the latter of whom publi&s;hed, in the year 1760, an en|tire volume on Canine Madne&s;s. Ancient authors were le&s;s diffu&s;e, and were gene|rally &s;atisfied with tran&s;cribing from each other. Mo&s;t of the&s;e writers I have con|&s;idered with attention, and acknowledge my&s;elf much obliged to them for many important facts: I cannot, however, avoid ob&s;erving, that their labours have a mani|fe&s;t tendency to confirm the fatal preju|dice which I mo&s;t devoutly wi&s;h to eradi|cate; I therefore think my&s;elf ju&s;tified in adding a &s;mall pamphlet to the volumi|nous tracts already written on the di&s;ea&s;e commonly, but improperly, called the <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> or dread of water. I &s;ay
<PB N="3" REF="5"><HI>improperly,</HI> becau&s;e this aver&s;ion to water, or to drink of every kind, is only one <HI>&s;ymptom</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, and that not con&s;tantly nor exclu&s;ively; for there are many examples on record, &s;uf|ficiently authenticated, of this &s;ymptom, this <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> in patients not bitten by a dog, or by any other animal.</P>
<P N="3">3. I am even inclined to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>hydrophobia</HI> is not generally a &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e produced by the bite of a mad dog. It rarely happens that the patient has any aver&s;ion to water or other liquid; until by experience he finds an in&s;uperable difficulty in &s;wallowing. He then dreads the approach of water, having already found that the attempt to &s;wallow any liquid produces a violent and painful con|vul&s;ion; &s;o that the &s;ymptom in que&s;tion is rather a real difficulty of &s;wallowing liquids, than a dread of water. As far as my own experience reaches, I can, with great truth, aver, that I have never yet met with a &s;ingle patient, who expre&s;&s;ed any aver&s;ion to the &s;ight, &s;ound, or mention of water, until he had found, by experi|ence, that drinking gave him pain.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<P N="4">4. Some years ago, I was &s;ent for to a young gentleman, who, about &s;ix weeks before, had been bit in the arm by one of his father's hounds. A few hours before his death, he &s;tept into a tub of warm water without fear, &s;at down, and continued in it half an hour. I &s;hall, in its proper place, relate his ca&s;e circum&s;tantially: I mention it at pre&s;ent only to prove, that the <HI>hydrophobia</HI> is improperly con&s;idered as a diagno&s;tic &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. I am equally inclined to di&s;pute the propriety of the denomination <HI>rabies ca|nina,</HI> canine madne&s;s; for though per&s;ons thus unhappily afflicted are often violently agitated during a &s;hort time previous to their death, yet they generally retain their rea&s;on to the la&s;t moment: this di&s;ea&s;e, therefore, is improperly con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of madne&s;s, if by madne&s;s we un|der&s;tand, a di&s;traction, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, or per|ver&s;ion of the rea&s;oning faculties.</P>
<P N="6">6. Writers, fond of &s;earching into an|tiquity for what is not worth finding, have taken great pains to di&s;cover the mo&s;t an|cient authors that have written on canine
<PB N="5" REF="7">madne&s;s. Hippocrates, mo&s;t certainly, has not &s;aid a &s;ingle word on the &s;ubject, whatever &s;ome of his wi&s;e commentators may have imagined. A learned li&s;t of ancient authors, who have written on the <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> may be collected from vari|ous modern writers; but we &s;earch in vain for u&s;eful information on this &s;ub|ject among the remains of high antiquity.</P>
<P N="7">7. But if the di&s;ea&s;e we are about to inve&s;tigate be neither a &s;pecies of <HI>rabies,</HI> nor <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> what &s;hall we call it!&mdash; It were idle to di&s;pute about a mere name; but when a mi&s;nomer conveys a fal&s;e idea, it is no longer a matter of indifference. The fatal di&s;order communicated to the human &s;pecies by the bite of a mad dog is doubtle&s;s a &s;pa&s;m of the organs of de|glutition and re&s;piration; a &s;pecies of <HI>an|gina convul&s;iva, vel &s;uffocativa.</HI> The generic term <HI>Angina,</HI> is thus defined by the learned Boerhaave, in his 783d apho|ri&s;m&mdash;<HI>Impedita valde, dolens admodum, vel et impedita et dolens &s;imul, deglutitio atque re&s;piratio, quae contingit a cau&s;a morbo&s;a agente in partes binis his functionibus in&s;er|vientes, &s;upra pulmones et &s;upra &s;tomachum
<PB N="6" REF="8">po&s;itas, Angina vocatur;</HI> and in aphori&s;m 818, he &s;ays,&mdash;<HI>Si convul&s;ionum cau&s;a quae|cunque mu&s;culos pharingis larynge&s;ve oc|cupaverit, oritur &s;ubita &s;uffocativa an|gina.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. As I am here writing particularly to medical readers, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;late the above quotation. Such read|ers, after comparing the&s;e definitions with the &s;ymptoms of the <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> as it is called, will, I believe, acknowledge their &s;urpri&s;e, that Boerhaave &s;hould not rather have cla&s;&s;ed it as a &s;pecies of <HI>angina</HI> than of <HI>mania.</HI> Later no&s;ologi&s;ts &s;eem equally un|fortunate in point of arrangement. In the &s;y&s;tem of the celebrated Sauvages, we find <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> in the cla&s;s <HI>Ve&s;aniae,</HI> and order <HI>Moro&s;itates.</HI> His definition of the cla&s;s is, <HI>error in imaginatione, appetitu, vel juditio;</HI> of the order, <HI>cupiditates aut aver&s;iones depravatae.</HI> Now, I appeal, not to &s;y&s;tematic writers, but to tho&s;e who have attended patients &s;uffering under this dreadful di&s;temper; and I reque&s;t them to recollect, whether erroneous imagina|tion, appetite, or judgment, or depraved de&s;ires or aver&s;ions, were among the &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="7" REF="9">they ob&s;erved? As to the patient's refu&s;ing to drink, it proceeds not from an imaginary aver&s;ion to water, but from a real, a painful convul&s;ion in the organs of deglutition, excited by every effort to &s;wallow liquids.</P>
<P N="9">9. Linneus divides the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;|tion into two di&s;tinct genera, <HI>viz. Rabies,</HI> and <HI>Hydrophobia:</HI> the fir&s;t he defines in the&s;e words, <HI>De&s;iderium mordendi laceran|dique innocuos;</HI> the &s;econd, thus, <HI>Aver|&s;atio potulentorum cum rigore et &s;ardia&s;i,</HI> adding, <HI>&s;oepius praecedenti maritata.</HI> He places them in the cla&s;s <HI>Mentales,</HI> and order <HI>Pathetici,</HI> where, from what I have &s;aid above, they mu&s;t appear to have no bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="10">10. In Vogel's arrangement, under the cla&s;s of <HI>Febres,</HI> and order <HI>continuae,</HI> we find the <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> thus characterized, <HI>Febris cum aver&s;atione liquidorum, &s;ingultu, convul&s;ione, et delirio.</HI> The ab&s;urdity of making the hydrophobia a continued fever is &s;o obvious, that it requires no comment.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P N="11">11. Dr. Cullen denominates his &s;econd cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>neuro&s;es,</HI> which he de|fines&mdash; <HI>Sen&s;us et motus lae&s;i, &s;ine pyrexia et &s;ine morbo locali. Spa&s;mi</HI> con&s;titute the third order of this cla&s;s, and of this order, the la&s;t genus is <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> thus defined &mdash; <HI>Potionis cuju&s;libet, ut convul&s;ionem pha|ryngis dolentem cientis, fa&s;tidium et horror; plerumque e mor&s;u animalis rabidi.</HI> Of this genus he admits two &s;pecies, <HI>viz. vulgaris,</HI> and <HI>&s;pontanea,</HI> the fir&s;t of which is the immediate object of our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="12">12. Dr. Cullen, with his u&s;ual &s;aga|city, &s;aw the error of former medical writers, who mi&s;took this &s;pa&s;m in the organs of deglutition, for a &s;pecies of madne&s;s.</P>
<P N="13">13. But by what name &s;oever we di&s;|tingui&s;h this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, previous to our enquiry concerning its &s;ymptoms in the human &s;pecies, let us endeavour to a&s;certain tho&s;e by which it may be known in the brute, where it originates.</P>
<P>Authors have amu&s;ed them&s;elves with learned di&s;qui&s;itions concerning the cau&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="11">of this <HI>rabies</HI> in dogs, wolves, foxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some accu&s;e worms within the cranium, or under the tongue. Dr. Cheyne a&s;cribed it to a &s;uperabundance of animal &s;alts, and Dr. James was of opinion that ex|tream heat, want of water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treat. on canine madne&s;s, p. <HI>20</HI></NOTE> and putrid animal food, are generally the cau&s;e of this madne&s;s in dogs, which he calls a fever.</P>
<P N="14">14. The u&s;ual &s;ymptoms which indi|cate approaching madne&s;s in a dog, are, fir&s;t, an evident diminution of his natural keen appetite for food. He eats, indeed, and laps his milk or water, but with obvious indifference. His eyes have lo&s;t their u&s;ual lu&s;tre; he drops his ears and tail, &s;hews no &s;ign of hilarity at the ap|proach of his ma&s;ter, and his whole a&s;pect exhibits a picture of melancholy, perfectly intelligible to tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve this animal with attention. In a day or two more, he refu&s;es both meat and drink, &s;huns the &s;ociety of other dogs, and is equally, after a &s;hort reconnoitre, avoided by them. He now quits his ha|bitation, runs forward, evidently without having any thing in pur&s;uit, &s;naps at every
<PB N="10" REF="12">animal that comes in his way, and within forty-eight hours dies convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="15">15. Such are the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;|temper in the brute creation; and the&s;e &s;ymptoms are &s;o con&s;tant and unequivocal, that all danger might ea&s;ily be prevented, by the &s;malle&s;t degree of attention. In the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, the dog has no propen&s;ity to bite, &s;o that he may be &s;eized and tied up without fear.</P>
<P N="16">16. Boerhaave has collected from <HI>Fra|ca&s;torius</HI> and other writers, a catalogue of &s;ymptoms more numerous, and &s;omewhat different from tho&s;e above enumerated; but as it was not the re&s;ult of his own ob&s;er|vation, his de&s;cription of this, as of many other di&s;ea&s;es, &s;hould be read, <HI>cum grano &s;alis.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. Pliny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. nat. Lib. 29, c. 5.</NOTE> in his chapter <HI>de medicina animalium,</HI> tells us, that there is a worm under the tongues of dogs, which if ex|tracted when they are whelps prevents their running mad. This doubtle&s;s was a vulgar error of the times in which he wrote, and thus the univer&s;al prevalence
<PB N="11" REF="13">of this ab&s;urd opinion down to the pre|&s;ent age is accounted for. Dr. James very ju&s;tly ridicules this idea of a worm under the tongue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">On can. mad. p. <HI>203.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;<Q>"I take it (&s;ays the Doctor) to be a nerve; and this con|tracting when recently taken away, the ideots fancy it &s;tirs, and believe it a worm, towhich it bears no manner of re&s;emblance."</Q>&mdash;He is certainly right in believing it not to be a worm; but he is mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing it a nerve, for a rea&s;on which him&s;elf hath adduced, name|ly, its contraction; nerves are not ela&s;tic. He is al&s;o wrong in &s;aying, it bears no re&s;emblance to a worm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De &s;ed. &amp; cau&s;. morb. lib. <HI>1.</HI> e&s;&s;. <HI>viii.</HI> art. <HI>35.</HI></NOTE> Morgagni pro|bably was nearer the truth, in calling it a tendinous ligament. Be it what it may, it is certainly of u&s;e to the dog and its extirpation an&s;wers no &s;alutary purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="18">18. Let us now trace the progre&s;s of this fatal di&s;ea&s;e in tho&s;e of the human &s;pecies who have the misfortune to be bit by a mad dog or cat. The wound, on immediate in&s;pection, di&s;covers no &s;igns of malignity. If it be &s;o &s;uperficial as &s;carcely to have drawn blood it generally heals without the lea&s;t inflammation, and
<PB N="12" REF="14">in that ca&s;e there is little or no danger: on the &s;econd day it &s;eems a mere &s;cratch, and on the third it is hardly vi&s;ible. But if, on the &s;econd morning, we ob&s;erve an inflamed circle &s;preading from the wound, re&s;embling that which &s;urrounds the puncture when inoculation for the &s;mall-pox has taken effect, there is rea&s;on to believe that part of the poi&s;onous <HI>&s;aliva</HI> of the enraged animal is ab&s;orbed, and the con&s;equent &s;ymptoms may be rationally expected.</P>
<P N="19">19. Meanwhile the patient takes the Orm&s;kirk, or &s;ome other equally infallible medicine, is hurried away to the &s;ea, in which he is two or three times dipped and half drowned; the wound heals, and all his apprehen&s;ions vani&s;h. Unhappily, this delu&s;ion al&s;o vani&s;hes in the &s;pace of five or &s;ix weeks, about which period he feels a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ymptom is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t mentioned by Salius.</NOTE> pain in the part where he was bit, gradually extending over the whole limb. He now recollects his misfortune. The horrible &s;tories he has heard ru&s;h upon his mind, and the hourly expectation of
<PB N="13" REF="15">madne&s;s and death fill his whole &s;oul. Under &s;uch apprehen&s;ions it is no wonder that he &s;hould di&s;cover &s;ymptoms of impatience, anxiety, and even of delirium. But the&s;e &s;ymptoms proceed from, and are always in proportion to, his appre|hen&s;ions. His rea&s;oning faculties continue unimpaired; his pul&s;e becomes irregular and quick; but there is no preternatural heat, foul tongue, nor any other febrile &s;ymptom. He complains of a fullne&s;s and prickling in his throat, and &s;wallows his &s;pittle with difficulty. So far from ex|pre&s;&s;ing any aver&s;ion to water, he calls for drink; but in the attempt to &s;wallow it he is convul&s;ed, and, after two or three painful efforts, the approach, or even the &s;ight of any liquid produces horror. He continues &s;ome time longer to &s;wallow &s;olid food without much pain or difficulty. At la&s;t even that is impo&s;&s;ible. He now becomes &s;en&s;ible of an irre&s;i&s;table inclination to &s;truggle, and wi&s;hes to be held; he breathes quick and with great difficulty, and in a few hours after dies convul&s;ed, as if he were &s;trangled with a cord.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="16">
<P N="20">20. Such, and &s;uch only, are the proper diagno&s;tic &s;ymptoms of this fatal di&s;order: they are amply &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h it from any other, and are therefore all that are nece&s;&s;ary to be generally known; but as a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o frequently mortal cannot be too well under&s;tood, I &s;hall proceed to mention the &s;ymptoms above omitted, as I find them enumerated by the principal authors that have written on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>Coelius Aurelianus,</HI> who collected his hi&s;tory of the <HI>hydrophobia</HI> from <HI>Eudemus, Soranus,</HI> and other writers with whom we are little acquainted, tells us that the <HI>hydrophobia</HI> is immediately pre|ceded by extreme irritability, unu&s;ual motions of the body, di&s;turbed &s;leep or ab&s;olute wakefulne&s;s, indige&s;tion, &s;tretch|ings, yawning, nau&s;ea, imaginary notions of bad weather, and no appetite for drink. To the&s;e &s;ymptoms, according to the &s;ame author, &s;ucceed, when the <HI>hydro|phobia</HI> begins, a de&s;ire to drink<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appetentia bibendi, <HI>which Dr. James tran&s;lates,</HI> a violent and in&s;atiable thir&s;t.&mdash;Treat. On Can, Madn. p. <HI>55.</HI></NOTE>, with terror at the &s;ight, &s;ound, or name of water. The patient is afraid even of
<PB N="15" REF="17">fomentations with oil; his pul&s;e is den&s;e <HI>(den&s;us)</HI> &s;mall and irregular: &s;ometimes a &s;mall degree of fever, convul&s;ive motions of the &s;tomach, &s;pa&s;ms in the precordia, numbne&s;s of the joints, and torpor of the inte&s;tinal canal; frequent inclination to make water; trembling and catchings of the limbs; voice hoar&s;e, re&s;embling the barking of a dog; &s;piral po&s;ture of the body, like that of a dog lying on the ground; anxiety when any per&s;on enters the room, as if apprehen&s;ive that he &s;hould bring water; redne&s;s of the face and eyes; body emaciated, the &s;uperior parts pale and &s;weating; <HI>veretri frequens ten&s;io cum &s;eminis involuntario jactu,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="22">22. To the &s;ymptoms above mentioned Boerhaave adds the following&mdash;La&s;&s;itude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aphor. 1138.</NOTE> weight, and indolence in every mu&s;cle of the body; di&s;turbed &s;leep, frequent &s;tartings, frightful dreams, convul&s;ions; con&s;tant inquietude, depre&s;&s;ion, &s;ighing, and love of &s;olitude. If the patient be bled, the blood exhibits no morbid ap|pearance. He now complains of a &s;queez|ing about his heart. He is terrified not only at the &s;ight of any fluid, but even of
<PB N="16" REF="18">any pellucid or reflecting body. He vomits vi&s;cid bilious phlegm or poraceous bile; grows hot and feveri&s;h. To a gradual exacerbation of the&s;e &s;ymptoms are now accumulated a dry projected tongue, open foaming mouth, extreme thir&s;t, an irre&s;i&s;table inclination to &s;pit at, and bite tho&s;e that are near him; cold &s;weats, complete <HI>rabies,</HI> and on the fourth day the patient dies.</P>
<P N="23">23. Dr. Mead copies Boerhaave without any material alteration, except in &s;aying that death relieves the patient in two days after the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of <HI>hydrophobia.</HI></P>
<P>Sauvages, in his <HI>No&s;ologia,</HI> adds no other &s;ymptom to tho&s;e above related; but from Dr. James we learn the following very curious and material proof of the &s;alutary in&s;tinct of dogs, namely, that they fly from per&s;ons actually infected by the bite of a mad animal.</P>
<P N="24">24. Such readers as are not acquainted with medical authors, and particularly with the writings of the celebrated Leyden profe&s;&s;or, will wonder why he
<PB N="17" REF="19">&s;hould have exhibited &s;o numerous a catalogue of &s;ymptoms, if it be true, that &s;o few of them really occur in patients afflicted with this malady. But his wonder will cea&s;e, when he is told that Boer|haave, when he began the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, found the &s;cience a mere chaos. He immediately conceived the idea of re|ducing it to method, and, after much reading, conden&s;ed and arranged his materials in the form of aphori&s;ms, con|&s;tituting a new &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic, which aphori&s;ms he u&s;ed as the text of his acade|mical lectures. All his &s;ymptoms very &s;eldom occur in the &s;ame patient: they were collected from a variety of authors, and are to be remembered by phy&s;icians, rather as po&s;&s;ible <HI>phenomena</HI> than as ab&s;o|lute diagno&s;tics.</P>
<P N="25">25. Having thus attended our unfortu|nate patient to the final period of his life, let us proceed to examine the morbid appearances in his body upon di&s;&s;ection.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="25">&s;tomach. In this la&s;t part of his theory, he followed the opinion of <HI>Arthemidorus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coel. Au|rel. Lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Artorius,</HI> and the di&s;ciples of <HI>A&s;clepiades.</HI></P>
<P N="36">36. Dr. Mead was per&s;uaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mechan. Acc. of Poi&s;ons.

<P N="37">37. Dr. James ridicules the&s;e opinions, and roundly declares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 37.</NOTE> that <Q>"he does not believe one &s;yllable of the modern doctrine of nervous juices and nervous di&s;tempers."</Q> Previous to the di&s;play of his own theory, in order to render it intelligible to readers unacquainted with anatomy, he tran&s;lates, from Boerhaave's preface to his <HI>collection of authors on the venereal di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> a minute de&s;cription of the cellular membrane; to which he adds two pages more, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, from Che&s;elden. The fir&s;t of the&s;e begins thus&mdash;<Q>"This membrane is of a va&s;cular contexture,"</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is certainly not true. If Dr. James had ever read &s;o com|mon a book as Haller's <HI>Primae Lineae,</HI> he
<PB N="24" REF="26">would not have quoted Boerhaave and Che&s;elden on this occa&s;ion. His theory, however, is briefly this&mdash;The poi&s;on con|tained in the &s;aliva of the mad dog is communicated through the wound made by his teeth to the fat contained in the cellular membrane, which fat, by fer|mentation with the &s;aliva, is a&s;&s;imilated into a poi&s;on; now this fat being mixt with the blood, and conveyed to the liver, by the <HI>vena portarum,</HI> the bile is contami|nated, and nece&s;&s;arily produces all the &s;ymptoms ob&s;ervable in canine madne&s;s.</P>
<P N="38">38. To render this theory more intel|ligible, the Doctor informs the ignorant reader,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 77.</NOTE> <Q>"that there is a perpetual inter|cour&s;e betwixt the blood ve&s;&s;els and the cellular membrane, and con&s;e|quently between the contents of both, the blood and fat."</Q>&mdash;It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that this poi&s;oned fat &s;hould, in its pa&s;&s;age to the liver, mix with the blood without injuring that fluid, which throughout the entire progre&s;s of the di&s;|ea&s;e is found to differ in nothing from that of a per&s;on in health. This ob&s;ta|cle was too obvious to e&s;cape the Doctor;
<PB N="25" REF="27">but he tumbles over it very clum&s;ily: he &s;uppo&s;es, notwith&s;tanding appearances, that the blood mu&s;t be ultimately viti|ated by the bile; &s;o that the blood fir&s;t vitiates the bile, and the bile returns the compliment to the blood.</P>
<P N="39">39. Thus, then, according to Dr. James, the liver is the primary &s;eat and fountain of the hydrophobia, which <HI>vi&s;|cus,</HI> he tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 82.</NOTE> <Q>"&s;upplies the re&s;t of the body with bile in immen&s;e quantities."</Q> In what phy&s;iological &s;chool the Doctor learnt that the re&s;t of the body is &s;upplied with bile in immen&s;e quantities is diffi|cult to imagine. I know of no part of the body which is &s;upplied with bile except the <HI>duodenum,</HI> where, mixing with the di|ge&s;ted aliment i&s;&s;uing from the &s;tomach, part of it is converted into chyle, and thereby bereft of all its bilious qualities, and the remainder carried through the inte&s;tinal canal, and finally ejected: &s;o that no bile, <HI>qua&s;i</HI> bile, is ab&s;orbed, and con&s;equently no part of the body except the inte&s;tinal canal is &s;upplied with this fluid.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="28">
<P N="40">40. But, if it be true that the liver is the part of the body chiefly affected in the human &s;pecies, we may, I think, fairly conclude, that this <HI>vi&s;cus</HI> is al&s;o the pri|mary &s;eat of the di&s;order in dogs. Now, it is very certain, that the liver of a mad dog, &s;uppo&s;ed to be an infallible remedy again&s;t canine madne&s;s, hath been frequently eaten without any bad effect.</P>
<P N="41">41. There is yet another objection to Dr. James's <HI>hypothe&s;is,</HI> which the ana|tomical reader will probably think of &s;ome weight.&mdash;Page 78 of his treati&s;e, he tells us, that <Q>"the poi&s;onous &s;aliva ad|hering to the tooth of a dog is im|mediately communicated to the fat re|&s;iding in one or more of the cells of the cellular membrane;" that "a &s;cratch is &s;ufficient, if it only rai&s;e the cuticle, without drawing a drop of blood;" for (continues the Doctor) this &s;ubtile poi&s;on, as well as the venereal venom, is capable of entering the cellular mem|brane when applied to any part not covered by the <HI>cuticula.</HI>"</Q></P>
<PB N="27" REF="29">
<P N="42">42. Is it po&s;&s;ible that Dr. James, the author of a medical dictionary in three folio volumes, &s;hould not have known, that there is no external part of the hu|man body which is not covered by the cuticle. That he was really ignorant of this fact is &s;till more evident from the following pa&s;&s;age in his 16th page&mdash;After relating a ca&s;e from Van Swieten, who quotes it from <HI>Palmarius,</HI> of &s;everal chil|dren having caught the <HI>hydrophobia</HI> by ki&s;&s;ing their father, who had been bit by a mad dog, he &s;ays&mdash;<Q>"In this ca&s;e it is very po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of the frothy &s;aliva might be conveyed to the lips or the mouth of the children, which, <HI>not being defended by the cuticle,</HI> might communicate the contagion, as it hap|pens with re&s;pect to the venereal poi|&s;on."</Q> &mdash;Now, it is not only certain that the <HI>glans penis,</HI> the lips, and mouth, are covered by the cuticle, but that it is continued through the fauces, <HI>oe&s;ophagus</HI> and inte&s;tinal canal.</P>
<P N="43">43. But the Doctor a&s;&s;ures us that, for the &s;aliva of the dog to poi&s;on the fat, <Q>"a &s;cratch is &s;ufficient, if it only rai&s;es the
<PB N="28" REF="30">cuticle."</Q> Surely, the Doctor had for|got, that the cellular membrane, with which he took &s;o much pains to make his readers acquainted, and in which the fat re&s;ides, adheres to the <HI>internal</HI> &s;urface of the <HI>cutis vera,</HI> which therefore mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be perforated before the &s;aliva can be brought into contact with the fat.</P>
<P N="44">44. If Dr. James had been at all ac|quainted with the ab&s;orbent lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e extremities perforate the cuticle in every part of the &s;urface of the body, he would not have deemed tho&s;e parts only which he &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;titute of this external &s;hield &s;u&s;ceptible of the canine poi&s;on. Though the medical world be much indebted to the minute enquiries of Doctors Monro and Hunter for a more perfect intelligence of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, yet the ab&s;orption of fluids through the pores of the &s;kin hath been generally known, even prior to the days of Galen, who, as a proof of this fact,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. de u&s;u puls. c. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays&mdash;<HI>Si &s;itiens balneum ineat, illi &s;itis &s;edabitur.</HI> Innumerable experiments have been made by later writers in order to e&s;tabli&s;h this doctrine, particularly by
<PB N="29" REF="31">Boyle, Bellini, and many others.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. Tr. No. <HI>II.</HI></NOTE> In the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions we read of men working in quick&s;ilver mines, who&s;e bodies had imbibed &s;o much of that metal, that they changed the colour of bra&s;s by rubbing it with their hands, or even by breathing upon it. We know that by handling turpentine the urine acquires a violet &s;mell; that tobacco will vomit, and aloes purge, when externally ap|plied; but the fact mo&s;t univer&s;ally known is the con&s;tant effect of mercu|rial unction.</P>
<P N="45">45. Hence it is evident that the <HI>cuti|cula,</HI> or <HI>epidermis,</HI> as it was called by the Greeks, is no defence again&s;t the canine, or any other poi&s;on, if the application be continued &s;ufficiently to give time for its ab&s;orption: it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, when the <HI>&s;aliva</HI> of a mad dog touches any part of the &s;kin, to wipe it off immediately, and wa&s;h the &s;pot. The examples, indeed, of per&s;ons thus infected without a wound are not numerous, becau&s;e tho&s;e on who&s;e hand or face the <HI>&s;aliva</HI> re&s;ts naturally wipe it off before it can be ab&s;orbed.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="32">
<P N="46">46. But, in defence of Dr. James it may be urged, that, whether the cuticle be pervious or not, or in what&s;oever manner the canine poi&s;on pa&s;s the <HI>cutis,</HI> it proves nothing again&s;t that part of his <HI>hypothe&s;is</HI> which e&s;tabli&s;hes the fat as the immediate receptacle of the poi&s;on, and its future vehicle to the liver.</P>
<P N="47">47. In reply to this defence, it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the bibulous lymphatics, by which fluids on the &s;urface of the body are ab&s;orbed, do not di&s;charge their contents into the cellular texture, but, creeping along its membranes, com|municate with larger veins which ter|minate in the <HI>receptaculum chyli,</HI> the thoracic <HI>duct,</HI> or jugular vein; &s;o that the canine poi&s;on, or any other fluid, ab&s;orbed from the &s;urface of the body, cannot remain in a &s;tate of extrava&s;ation with the fat in the cellular web, but mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be thrown into the general ma&s;s of circulating fluids<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"I &s;hall avail my&s;elf (&s;ays Dr. James) of but one more argument to illu&s;trate the probability of the canine venom being received and fo&s;tered in the mem|brane which contains the fat, or rather in the fat it&s;elf. And this I draw from the method of cure; for that very medicine which cures the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e re&s;idence is in the fat, is al&s;o found effectual in preventing and even curing canine madne&s;s."</Q>&mdash; Unfortunately for this argument the venereal di&s;ea&s;e <HI>does not</HI> re&s;ide in the fat.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="33">
<P N="48">48. Dr. James's theory, therefore, being contradicted by anatomical demon&s;tration, nece&s;&s;arily falls to the ground. The hypo|the&s;is of Boerhaave, Mead, and others, who &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e to be in the nervous fluid, is equally in&s;up|portable, becau&s;e no &s;uch fluid circulates in the nerves, which are not tubes but &s;olid fibres, who&s;e extremities therefore are incapable of ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="49">49. If the&s;e theories be fal&s;e, tho&s;e who read for information will a&s;k, where lies the truth? If &s;uch readers have &s;ufficiently attended to the 47th paragraph they will ea&s;ily conceive that the poi&s;onous &s;aliva of the dog is ab&s;orbed by the capillary lymphatic veins, who&s;e ramifications ex|pand to every part of the &s;urface of the human body; tho&s;e veins which imbibe the matter communicated by inoculation, the venereal <HI>virus,</HI> water, and infectious <HI>mia&s;mata</HI> from the air.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="34">
<P N="50">50. But, if this be true, why is it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to communicate the &s;mall pox by inoculation, that the cuticle &s;hould be rai&s;ed?&mdash;I an&s;wer: It is not nece&s;&s;ary; but that by this operation the communication of the di&s;ea&s;e is rendered more certain, becau&s;e the matter being lodged under the cuticle, by re|taining its moi&s;ture, continues longer in a fit &s;tate for ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="51">51. If it &s;hould be further a&s;ked, why the canine poi&s;on, thus introduced, con|tinues circulating in the body five or &s;ix weeks before it produces that di&s;ea&s;e, of a &s;ingle paroxi&s;m, called the <HI>hydrophobia?</HI> &mdash;I an&s;wer, that in this it differs from other inoculated di&s;ea&s;es only in point of time, In all inoculations there is an in|tervention of &s;ome days between the cau&s;e and effect; but why that of canine madne&s;s requires a longer time for a&s;&s;imilation and maturity mu&s;t remain a my&s;tery, until we are better acquainted with na|ture's <HI>modus operandi.</HI> Probably there are other contagious di&s;ea&s;es who&s;e malignant <HI>mia&s;mata</HI> may be equally &s;low in their progre&s;s from admi&s;&s;ion to efficiency.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="35">
<P N="52">52. Some attempts have been made to di&s;cover the nature of this canine poi&s;on by the help of micro&s;copes and chemical experiments; but to no purpo&s;e. Dr. Mead &s;uppo&s;ed it to con&s;i&s;t of fiery &s;aline particles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;ert. Med. de rab. can. Edinb. <HI>1771.</HI></NOTE> Dr. Hey&s;ham believes it to be an acid; but this is mere conjecture. All we know of the matter is, that it is a poi&s;on <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> which, being ab&s;orbed by the lymphatic veins, produces certain effects in the human body; no mecha|nical nor chemical theory, therefore, can a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the invention of a remedy again&s;t the bite of a mad dog. Analogy may po&s;&s;ibly be of &s;ome u&s;e. Chance, the great inventor of medicines, hath not, I think, been &s;ucce&s;sful in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.

<P N="53">53. Mithridates, king of Pontus, about two thou&s;and years ago, is &s;aid to have invented that farrago of more than forty ingredients called by his name.

<P N="54">54. <HI>Andromachus,</HI> a native of Crete, cotemporary with Galen, not &s;atisfied with an antidote of forty-five ingredients, com|po&s;ed one of more than &s;ixty, which he called <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>(&s;erenitas)</HI> from its &s;edative or anodyne effect.

Dr. Mead is of opinion that this remedy is recommended by the ancients upon rational grounds, becau&s;e it is a diuretic; <Q>"For (&s;ays he) "the &s;ure&s;t reme|dies in all ages again&s;t this venom have been &s;uch as provoke a great di&s;charge by urine."</Q> Reflecting on this circum|&s;tance,
<PB N="37" REF="39">this <HI>E&s;culapius</HI> of his times, con|ceived the great idea of recommending to the world his infallible <HI>Pulvis Antyli&s;&s;us,</HI> which, at the doctor's reque&s;t, was ho|noured with a place in the London <HI>Pharmacopoeia.</HI></P>
<P N="58">58. Whence did Dr. Mead conclude that this powder of calcined river crabs, or crawfi&s;h (for &s;uch he &s;uppo&s;es them to have been) would <HI>promote a great di&s;charge of urine?</HI> He certainly thought that this calcination, like the incineration of vege|tables, would produce an alkaline &s;alt. If he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t degree of chemical knowledge, he would have known that the animal it&s;elf would burn to a mere earth, totally inert, and that its &s;hell would be converted into quick lime, of which con&s;equently, with a very &s;mall proportion of earth, this &s;pecific mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="59">59. Dr. James's chemical knowledge appears to have been not much inferior to that of Dr. Mead, whom he thinks to|tally wrong in tran&s;lating the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> and Galen, <HI>River Crawfi&s;h.</HI> He is clearly of opinion, and
<PB N="38" REF="40">takes &s;ome pains to prove, that the&s;e authors meant a &s;pecies of river crab, and not crawfi&s;h. Dr. James prudently ob|&s;erves, that we ought to be very accurate in our quotations from ancient authors, <Q>"le&s;t the medicine recommended be mi&s;taken for &s;omething that may not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame virtues."</Q> This is doubtle&s;s a wi&s;e ob&s;ervation; but any chemi&s;t's boy would have told him, that the virtues, whatever they may be, of a calcined crawfi&s;h, crab, or oi&s;ter, are exactly the &s;ame; that all &s;hells are calca|rious earth, and con&s;equently burn to quick lime, in no re&s;pect different from that produced by the calcination of chalk, lime-&s;tone, or marble. But, that Dr. James, as well as Dr. Mead, &s;uppo&s;ed that this calcination of river crabs produced an alkaline &s;alt is evident from the following pa&s;&s;age. Speaking of this powder, he &s;ays &mdash; <Q>"I believe it may have &s;ome efficacy in preventing the canine madne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 215.</NOTE> though none that can be depended upon. This opinion is founded on its being an highly alkaline &s;ub&s;tance; and all or mo&s;t of the pretended &s;pecifics for this di&s;temper are alkaline, and de&s;troyers of
<PB N="39" REF="41">acids; as the celebrated pancake made of oi&s;ter-&s;hells, mentioned by De&s;&s;ault, <HI>Armenian Bole, Tin,</HI> and many other."</Q> The&s;e la&s;t words put the doctor's &s;kill in chemi&s;try quite out of doubt.</P>
<P N="60">60. But, as we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that Dio&s;corides and Galen ventured to give their patients two &s;poonfuls of quick lime, it is probable that they did not calcine the&s;e crabs, or crawfi&s;h, &s;ufficiently to convert the &s;hells into lime, though long enough to di&s;&s;ipate the volatile parts of the animal. On this &s;uppo&s;ition this &s;pecific powder becomes a mere ab&s;orbent earth, a <HI>pulvis &egrave; chelis cancrorum,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no diuretic virtue; yet Galen pro|nounces it infallible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De &s;impl. med facul.

<P N="61">61. The next diuretic antidote of the ancients, <Q>"recommended (as Dr. Mead thinks) upon rational grounds,"</Q> is the <HI>Spongia Cynorrhodi,</HI> &s;ponge of the dog|ro&s;e, <Q>"Which (&s;ays the Doctor) is &s;o celebrated an antidote, that <HI>P.

<PB N="40" REF="42">with the &s;ame name, and equally in&s;ignificant in its medical capacity. The&s;e <HI>panaceas</HI> are generally good for nothing. But Dr. Mead ranks this gall of the briar among his animal diuretics, becau&s;e Mr. Ray found it to be the nidus of a fly.&mdash; <Q>"Now (&s;ays the Doctor) all in&s;ects abound with a diuretic &s;alt."</Q>&mdash;If the lie direct were admi&s;&s;ible in polite conver|&s;ation, I would &s;ay, <HI>this is not true.</HI> But I marvel exceedingly that he did not ob|&s;erve that this <HI>Sanatodos</HI> of the Sicilians is called in England a <HI>Dog</HI>-ro&s;e, becau&s;e it produces a medicine for a mad-<HI>dog:</HI> al&s;o, that he forgot to inform his readers, that this celebrated antidote originated in the dream of an old woman, as he mu&s;t have read in Pliny.</P>
<P N="62">62. Dr. Mead, after &s;pecifying, from the ancients, other diuretics, which cer|tainly are <HI>not</HI> diuretics, proceeds to the recommendation of his infallible <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us,</HI> which he declared never failed of &s;ucce&s;s, though he had u&s;ed it a thou|&s;and times. <Q>"I have often wi&s;hed (adds the Doctor) that I knew &s;o certain a remedy in any other di&s;ea&s;e."</Q>&mdash;Surely
<PB N="41" REF="43">&s;uch te&s;timony, from &s;o great a phy&s;ician, mu&s;t be more than &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the infallibility of any medicine beyond all &s;u&s;picion: and yet two greater men, Boerhaave and Van Swieten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aph. 1147.</NOTE> are of opinion that it is good for nothing; and Dr. James a&s;&s;ures us, that <Q>"it has been given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa. 227.</NOTE> without &s;ucce&s;s, to a great number of people and animals in many parts of the kingdom."</Q></P>
<P N="63">63. This infallible <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us</HI> is pre&s;cribed by Dr. Mead in the following words&mdash; <Q>"Take of the herb called, in Latin, <HI>Lichen cinereus terre&s;tris,</HI> in Engli&s;h, A&s;h-coloured ground-liver|wort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, half an ounce; of black pepper pow|dered, two drachms. Mix the&s;e toge|ther, and divide the powder into four do&s;es, one of which mu&s;t be taken every morning fa&s;ting for four morn|ings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in a pint of cows milk."</Q>&mdash;I have now before me a London Di&s;pen&s;atory with manu&s;cript notes by my worthy friend Dr. Longfield, a phy&s;ician de&s;ervedly di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;ound judgement, and exten&s;ive me|dical
<PB N="42" REF="44">knowledge. On the blank leaf op|po&s;ite to the <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us,</HI> he wrote&mdash; <Q>"This is Dr. Mead's famous powder: it is mo&s;t certain that it never cured one per&s;on bit by a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d dog."</Q></P>
<P N="64">64. A moderate &s;hare of experience in the medical powers of plants is &s;ufficient to determine <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> the virtue of this Lichen, which, together with the re&s;t of its tribe, di&s;covers no other &s;en&s;ible qua|lity than a &s;light degree of a&s;tringency, and therefore can have no other effect than what may be expected from any other medicine, a&s;tringent in the &s;ame degree; unle&s;s we admit the doctrine of &s;pecifies, to which Dr. Mead would doubtle&s;s have objected, being him&s;elf a <HI>&s;ectator</HI> of the mechanical Belini.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pb. botan.

<PB N="43" REF="45">I think, ju&s;tly proceed to the condemna|tion of the infallible <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="65">65. But Dr. Mead, in order to con|vince the world that he had not adopted this medicine without proper &s;cientific inve&s;tigation, informs his readers, that he examined the <HI>Lichen cinereus terre&s;tris</HI> by di&s;tillation, and that the re&s;ult of his ana|ly&s;is was, &s;ome acid water, &s;ome oil, and &s;ome coal that contained fixt &s;alt. A bunch of docks, of nettles, of thi&s;tles, or of any other common weed, would have yielded the &s;ame. This &s;ort of analy&s;is can be of no u&s;e in di&s;covering the medi|cal virtues of plants. The receipt to make this celebrated <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us</HI> was fir&s;t brought to England by Captain Dampier, who called the plant Jew's Ear (<HI>Tremella auricula</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus</HI>) a kind of a&s;h-coloured fungus, which is frequently found on the trunks of old trees. But it &s;eems Sir Hans Sloane was of opinion that the Cap|tain was mi&s;taken; that he certainly meant the a&s;h-coloured Liverwort, which, on the authority of &s;o great a naturali&s;t, was ac|cordingly adopted. Is it not probable from this hi&s;tory, that, in rejecting the
<PB N="44" REF="46">original Jew's Ear, Dr. Mead &s;eized the ear of the wrong &s;ow?</P>
<P N="66">66. The next infallible medicine I &s;hall examine is that which, about thirty years ago, was brought from Tonquin by Sir George Cobb, when he returned from the Ea&s;t Indies. It con&s;i&s;ts of native and factitious Cinnabar each twenty-four grains, with &s;ixteen grains of Mu&s;k, powdered and mixt well together. This do&s;e is to be taken in a gla&s;s of Arrack once only, and repeated after an interval of thirty days The ab&s;urdity of making any di&s;tinction between <HI>native</HI> and <HI>factiti|ous</HI> Cinnabar, which are preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, is too obvious to need a commen|tary: it proves, however, the ignorance of the Chine&s;e old woman who probably invented the medicine, and of all tho&s;e who in pre&s;cribing this powder have con|tinued to ob&s;erve the &s;ame ridiculous di&s;|tinction. But, in the compo&s;ition of this &s;pecific, there is another ab&s;urdity of more importance. All the cinnabars, whether <HI>native, factitious,</HI> or of cinnabar of <HI>anti|mony,</HI> are mere powder of po&s;t; ab&s;o|lutely inert.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="47">
<P N="67">67. <Q>"Factitious cinnabar (&s;ays Dr. James) is made of three parts of mer|cury to one of &s;ulphur; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa. 155.</NOTE> as I re|member, a pound of good native cin|nabar yields near fourteen ounces of fluid mercury; and therefore it &s;eems that the good effects of this medicine ought to be principally, if not entirely, a&s;cribed to mercury."</Q>&mdash;Dr. James, hav|ing re&s;olved to &s;port a preparation of mer|cury as the only &s;pecific for canine mad|ne&s;s, was quite &s;atisfied with this &s;ort of rea&s;oning: but <HI>we</HI> mu&s;t come nearer to the point.</P>
<P N="68">68. Native cinnabar is the ore of mer|cury; that is, mercury mineralized by &s;ulphur, in the proportion of about &s;ix, &s;even, or eight parts of the former to one of the latter.&mdash;Sulphur po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ingu|lar property, in combination with mer|cury or antimony, of rendering both the&s;e violent metallic &s;ub&s;tances inactive. It is particularly well known of antimony that it is more or le&s;s mild in proportion as the <HI>regulus</HI> is combined with more or le&s;s &s;ulphur. This chemical fact Dr. James mu&s;t have known, if he had under&s;tood
<PB N="46" REF="48">the proce&s;s for making his own fever-powder. But mercury, before it can ex|ert its &s;timulant power, mu&s;t not only be completely extricated from the &s;ulphur with which it formed cinnabar, but mu&s;t afterwards be divided by trituration, or di&s;&s;olved in a mineral acid. Now, the only means of decompo&s;ing cinnabar is by fire, in, what is called by chemi&s;ts, the dry way. In the human body, therefore, it is impo&s;&s;ible; but if we could &s;uppo&s;e the mercury actually &s;eparated from the &s;ulphur, not being di&s;&s;olved by a mineral acid, or otherwi&s;e divided, it would &s;till remain in a &s;tate of total inactivity: <HI>a priori,</HI> therefore, cinnabar may be pro|nounced inert.</P>
<P N="69">69. But, le&s;t the advocates for this Tonquin medicine &s;hould deem this &s;ort of philo&s;ophical argument inconclu&s;ive, let us take the opinions of a few eminent chemi&s;ts on the &s;ubject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa. 451.</NOTE>&mdash;Dr. Cullen, in his Lectures on <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> &s;peaking of mercurial preparations, &s;ays&mdash; <Q>"Crude mercury, and the combination in cin|nabar and <HI>Aethiops mineralis,</HI> to which may be added <HI>Aethiops antimonialis,</HI> in
<PB N="47" REF="49">&s;o far as it contains mercury, can only by accident, or indirectly, prove medi|cines."</Q>&mdash;<Q>"Triturated with &s;ulphur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa. 444.</NOTE> mercury becomes an inert &s;ub&s;tance. This I could determine <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> whe|ther it was in the form of Aethiops mineral, or native or factitious cinna|bar."</Q>&mdash;Dr. Lewis in his Di&s;pen&s;atory tells us, that <Q>"cinnabar, like Aethiops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa. 331.</NOTE> is inactive."</Q>&mdash;Cartheu&s;er, having given a large quantity to a dog, &s;ays, that it pro|duced no &s;en&s;ible effect, but that part of it pa&s;&s;ed through the inte&s;tines unaltered, and that the remainder was found in the &s;tomach and bowels.&mdash;Dr. Longfield, whom I have before mentioned, wrote the following note on the article <HI>cinnabaris factitia</HI> in the <HI>Pharm. Col. Reg. Med. Londinen&s;is</HI>&mdash;<Q>"It is a &s;hame that the cin|nabars are not totally exploded: they have not the lea&s;t title to the character of nervous medicines; they are both inert."</Q>&mdash;But it were unfair to conceal from the reader, that a famous German chemi&s;t of the la&s;t century was of a dif|ferent opinion. He con&s;idered cinnabar as an efficacious medicine, and a&s;cribed its virtue to its beautiful colour, with which
<PB N="48" REF="50"><HI>Archeus</HI> is &s;o charmed as to neglect the di&s;ea&s;e which he was employed in exiting; for it &s;eems this <HI>Archeus,</HI> this creature of Van Helmont's di&s;tempered brain, is won|derfully delighted with the colour red.</P>
<P N="70">70. In an&s;wer to all this rea&s;oning <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> I &s;hall be told, that experience is the only te&s;t, and that the in&s;tances upon record, of the hydrophobia being cured or prevented by the Tonquin powder are innumerable. In reply to this an&s;wer&mdash; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> there are examples upon record of per&s;ons having died of the hydrophobia after taking it, particularly in two ca&s;es related in the London <HI>Medical Ob&s;er|vation:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page <HI>195,</HI> and apen|dix, p. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Secondly,</HI> many other medicines, equally infallible and equally extolled, have de&s;ervedly &s;unk into contempt: <HI>Thirdly,</HI> no atte&s;tation of facts will con|vince a rational being that an effect was produced without a &s;ufficient cau&s;e: now, a &s;ub&s;tance which is demon&s;trably inert can produce no effect in an animal body, and therefore can cure no di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="71">71. Cinnabar being thus, I think, fairly di&s;patched, if there be any anti|dotal
<PB N="49" REF="51">power in the Tonquin medicine, it mu&s;t be attributed to to the anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue of the musk: Dr. James a&s;cribes it to its alkaline quality&mdash; <Q>"Mu&s;k (he tells us) is an animal &s;ub&s;tance, and con&s;e|quently of an alkaline nature; and as alkalies have in all ages been recom|mended in this ca&s;e, it &s;eems at lea&s;t to be not prejudicial."</Q>&mdash;This is <HI>damning mu&s;k with faint prai&s;e.</HI> But what did the Doctor mean by a&s;cribing to it an alkaline quality becau&s;e it is an animal &s;ub&s;tance? Had he forgot that animal matter wants the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fire to pro|duce alkali? If every &s;pecies of animal matter be an alkaline medicine, the parings of his own nails would have done as well. Mu&s;k, however, is doubtle&s;s a powerful anti&s;pa&s;modic, and for that rea&s;on may be of &s;ervice in the <HI>hydrophobia.</HI></P>
<P N="72">72. This Tonquin powder is ordered to be taken in a gla&s;s of Arrack, doubtle&s;s with no other intention than to cover the ta&s;te of the mu&s;k. This vehicle, how|ever, &s;ugge&s;ts an idea, which, though I may think it extravagant, I will commu|nicate. Suppo&s;e, when the &s;ymptoms of
<PB N="50" REF="52">the fatal di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion fir&s;t appear, previous to the difficulty of &s;wallowing liquids, the patient were to drink to in|toxication of any &s;trong liquor he may chu&s;e. Who, without trying it, will pretend to circum&s;cribe the anti&s;pa&s;modic effect of this remedy? It is certainly not contra-indicated by any febrile or mani|acal &s;ymptoms. In a forlorn hope no at|tempt can be too extravagant. It will at lea&s;t an&s;wer one good purpo&s;e: I mean that of relieving the patient from &s;everal hours of the mo&s;t horrid anxiety that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived.</P>
<P N="73">73. I now beg leave to call the reader's attention to the mercurial preparation &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly recommended by Dr. James in his <HI>Treati&s;e on Canine Madne&s;s.</HI> It is called <HI>Turpith mineral;</HI> it is a precipitate of mercury from its &s;olution in the Vitri|olic acid, by which it was not only di&s;|&s;olved but calcined. Whether it be a pure calx of mercury, without any adhe&s;ion of vitriolic &s;alt, is a matter of di&s;pute among chemi&s;ts of the fir&s;t reputation. Mon&s;ieur Baum&egrave; declares po&s;itively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vol. ii. p. 403.</NOTE> <HI>que, ce precipit&egrave; e&s;t ab&s;olument priv&eacute; de toute acide, lor&s;qu'il

It is a very rough mercurial, fit only for dogs, to which animals Dr. James &s;eems to have given it with &s;ucce&s;s. As to its effect on the human &s;pecies, he produces no more than one &s;ingle ca&s;e of a patient bit by a mad dog, and cured under his own immediate care by Turpith mineral, He relates, indeed, three or four other ca&s;es in &s;upport of his &s;pecific, on the authority of per&s;ons of his acquaintance; but <HI>hear-&s;ay</HI> evidence in this ca&s;e, as in courts of ju&s;tice, is inadmi&s;&s;able.&mdash;Dr. Raymond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. Ob&s;. append. p. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> phy&s;ician at Mar&s;eilles gave &s;even bolu&s;es, containing each four grains of Turpith mineral, to a patient bit by a mad dog: the patient died.</P>
<P N="74">74. The Orm&s;kirk medicine, which in many parts of this kingdom, particularly in the North, is deemed infallible, ap|pears, from the report of Dr. Black and Dr. Hey&s;ham, to con&s;i&s;t of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. Com. Vol. <HI>v.</HI> p. <HI>50.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Powder of chalk,</HI> half an ounce; <HI>Armenian bole,</HI> three drachms; <HI>Allum,</HI> ten grains; <HI>Powder of elecampane root,</HI> one drachm; <HI>Oil of ani&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="54">&s;ix drops.&mdash;Now, though the chemical enquiries of the&s;e gentlemen may not be admitted as proof po&s;itive, yet when the re&s;ult of experiments made by two able chemi&s;ts, at different times, is preci&s;ely the &s;ame; when a medicine compo&s;ed of the &s;uppo&s;ed ingredients has the &s;ame colour, ta&s;te, and &s;mell, we have the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umptive evidence that our conjectures are well founded; e&s;pecially, when there is no di&s;coverable difference between the effect of the real and &s;up|po&s;ed compo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="75">75. As to the medical virtues of the ingredients above-mentioned, they are &s;uf|ficiently known.&mdash;Chalk is a mere ab&s;or|bent earth, without any other power than that of de&s;troying the acid it may meet with in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and, during the efferve&s;cence, of producing a little calca|rious gas, commonly called fixt air.&mdash; Armenian bole, &s;uch as is generally &s;old by the druggi&s;ts, is nothing more than a lump of pipe-clay, coloured with a little red ochre or ru&s;t of iron.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Engli&s;h or Dutch Armenian bole is, in no re&s;pect, inferior to the true Oriental, or to any other bole, for medical purpo&s;es.</NOTE>&mdash;Allum is an
<PB N="53" REF="55">a&s;tringent, and nothing more.&mdash;Elecam|pane-root hath been generally ranked among the Alexipharmics; it is &s;aid to a&s;&s;i&s;t expectoration, and, in large do&s;es, to act as a diuretic and cathartic: it is, how|ever, in no e&s;timation, and in &s;o &s;mall a do&s;e, mixt with the other ingredients, can produce no effect.&mdash;As to the &s;ix drops of oil of ani&s;eed, I pre&s;ume their efficacy, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, will hardly be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P N="76">76. Po&s;&s;ibly I may be told, that, though the&s;e &s;everal ingredients, &s;eparately taken, may po&s;&s;e&s;s no extraordinary medical powers, yet, like other compounds they may, when united, form a medicine of con&s;iderable virtue.&mdash;I acknowledge that a powerful medicine may be formed by a judicious combination of &s;imple ingre|dients, pre&s;cribed on chemical principles; but I am very certain, that an ignorant jumble of chalk, clay, allum, and elecam|pane, will form nothing but an hetero|generous ma&s;s of dirt, that may do harm, but cannot po&s;&s;ibly do good in any di&s;ea&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="56">
<P N="77">77. But, &s;ay the advocates for the Orm|&s;kirk powder, what &s;ignifies rea&s;oning again&s;t facts? Are there not a thou&s;and examples of the hydrophobia prevented by taking this medicine? Would the &s;a|gacious inhabitants of the northern coun|ties have &s;uch faith in a mere <HI>ignis fatuus?</HI> &mdash;Far be it from me, to doubt the &s;a|gacity of the northern counties: they are by no means &s;ingular in mi&s;taking &s;had|dows for realities. All quack-medicines, and more than half the medicines u&s;ed in regular practice, are <HI>ignes fatui.</HI> What are all the vaunted <HI>panaceas, theriacas,</HI> antidotes, and &s;pecifics, but <HI>ignes fatui,</HI> deceptions, chimeras?</P>
<P N="78">78. The &s;everal &s;pecifics above con&s;i|dered have all &s;ucce&s;&s;ively had their day of infallibility, and have all been equally &s;upported by experience, the true te&s;t of medical virtue: that is, a number of people bitten, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be bitten, by dogs &s;uppo&s;ed to be mad, have taken the Orm&s;kirk, or any other infallible powder, and have e&s;caped the hydro|phobia.

<P N="79">79. This cen&s;ure I do not confine to the Orm&s;kirk, nor yet to any of the medi|cines above-mentioned: it comprehends every prophylactic remedy taken inter|nally. Can any thing be more ab&s;urd than to imagine, that a di&s;ea&s;e received into the body by inoculation; a poi&s;on ab&s;orbed by the lymphatic veins, and mixed with the general ma&s;s of circu|lating fluids, can be de&s;troyed by a medi|cine taken into the &s;tomach? Is there any analogy in the hi&s;tory of phy&s;ic to autho|rize &s;uch expectations? Will any powder, pill, or bolus, &s;top the progre&s;s of the &s;mall-pox by inoculation, or prevent it from taking effect? Was there ever a phy|&s;ician

<P N="80">80. Having thus, I hope not unfairly, con&s;idered the preten&s;ions to infallibility of the &s;pecifics introduced and recom|mended by particular men, we are come at la&s;t to that &s;overeign remedy extolled by every writer on canine madne&s;s, ancient and modern, and u&s;ed in all countries, in every age, from the days of Cel&s;us to the pre&s;ent moment&mdash;I mean <HI>bathing in cold water.</HI> To this part of our &s;ubject I beg the reader's particular attention, becau&s;e I am very certain that many lives have been lo&s;t by a fooli&s;h dependence on this broken reed. I have &s;aid that all writers on canine madne&s;s, ancient and modern, have recommended cold-bathing; but I mu&s;t except Dr. Falck, the author of <HI>The Seaman's Medical In&s;tructor,</HI> and Dr. Fo|thergill, who wrote a paper in the <HI>London Medical Ob&s;ervations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vol. v. p. 290.</NOTE> purpo&s;ely to prove the inefficacy of bathing in the &s;ea.</P>
<P N="81">81. The phy&s;ician la&s;t mentioned was of opinion, that the practice of bathing
<PB N="57" REF="59">in &s;alt-water, as a pre&s;ervative, originated in a mi&s;take. Cel&s;us directs the patient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cel&s;. lib. <HI>v.</HI> c. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE> actually labouring under the hydrophobia, to be thrown unexpectedly into a fi&s;h|pond: if he cannot &s;wim, he is to be &s;uffered to flounce and drink, rai&s;ing him a little now and then, &s;o as to keep him from drowning; but, if he can &s;wim, he is to be frequently ducked, that in &s;pite of him&s;elf he may be &s;atiated with water: <Q>"Thus (&s;ays Cel&s;us) his thir&s;t and dread of water will be cured at the &s;ame time."</Q></P>
<P N="82">82. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> was mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that he could force the patient to drink by holding him under water, or that, after being half drowned, he would look on water with le&s;s horrour, or &s;wallow liquids with greater ea&s;e. The latter part of this di&s;cipline is daily practi&s;ed, by the old women at the watering places, on the wretched creatures that are &s;ent by old women, male and female, from the inland country. This practice of drowning the patient in order to cure him of an aver&s;ion to water, ab&s;urd as it is, was probably taken from <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> who, though a &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="58" REF="60">man, po&s;&s;ibly without experience or much reflexion, pre&s;cribed it on the authority of &s;ome Greek writer; but why the &s;ea was &s;ub&s;tituted for a fi&s;h-pond, and how it came to pa&s;s that what <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ordered as a cure for the hydrophobia actually pre&s;ent, &s;hould be applied as a prophy|lactic, a pre&s;ervative remedy, is difficult to conceive.</P>
<P N="83">83. Who was the inventor of this im|mer&s;ion in &s;alt water I cannot determine. I am inclined to think that it originated in Holland or Flanders, in the days of panaceas, charms, witches, and hob|goblins. That it was a common practice in the Netherlands in the &s;ixteenth century appears from the following pa&s;&s;age from Van Helmont; which, as his books are not in every library, and, I believe, were never <HI>done</HI> into Engli&s;h, I &s;hall endeavour to tran&s;late literally.&mdash;<Q>"There is a fortre&s;s on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, about four leagues from Ghent, called Sluce. There I &s;aw a &s;hip pa&s;&s;ing by, and in it an old man, naked, bound, and weights fa&s;tened to his feet. Under his arms they had tied a rope, the other end of
<PB N="59" REF="61">which was fixed to the yard-arm of the ve&s;&s;el. I a&s;ked the meaning of this &s;pectacle, and was an&s;wered by one of the &s;ailors, that the old man had got the <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> having, &s;ome time ago, been bit by a mad dog. Why, I a&s;ked, is he brought to the &s;ea? Whe|ther they meant to drown him? 'No, no, (&s;aid the &s;ailor) he will &s;oon be cured; &s;uch is the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon the &s;ea, that it will in&s;tantly cure this kind of madne&s;s.' At my reque&s;t they took me on board. We had &s;carce &s;ailed a mile, when the &s;ailors, by pulling out a plug in the bottom of the &s;hip, let in the water, till &s;he &s;unk almo&s;t to the edge of the gunwale. This &s;ea-water they collected for the purpo&s;e of making &s;alt. The plug being now re-adapted, two men hauled down the oppo&s;ite end of the yard, and thus hoi&s;ted the old man into the air. They then let him drop into the &s;ea, and he remained under water <HI>ad &s;patium Mi&s;erere.</HI> They repeated this operation twice more, keeping him each time under water <HI>ad &s;patium Salutationis Angelicae."</HI></Q></P>
<PB N="60" REF="62">
<P N="84">84. Some profane readers may po&s;&s;ibly be inclined to comment ludicrou&s;ly on this <HI>&s;patium Salutationis Angelicae;</HI> but, choo&s;ing rather to treat the matter &s;e|riou&s;ly, I reque&s;ted a friend to read over the <HI>Mi&s;erere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;alm</HI> LI.</NOTE> and found by my &s;top-watch, that he performed it in one minute and thirty-five &s;econds; and the <HI>Salutatio An|gelica</HI> in ten &s;econds. Van Helmont is not &s;ufficiently explicit in this important part of his narrative. Whether this was only a method of computing time, or whether the&s;e p&s;alms were actually re|peated during the immer&s;ion, does not ap|pear. I am inclined to think they were: if &s;o, this capital omi&s;&s;ion in our old women on the &s;ea coa&s;t &s;ufficiently ac|counts for their fallibility. But to pro|ceed with Van Helmont's &s;tory.</P>
<P N="85">85. <Q>"They then laid him on his back acro&s;s a barrel, and covered him with a watch-coat. I concluded he was dead; but the &s;ailors ridiculed my ap|prehen&s;ions. Being now relea&s;ed from his bonds, he di&s;charged all the water which he had <HI>in&s;pired,</HI> and pre&s;ently revived. He was a cooper from Ghent,
<PB N="61" REF="63">and being cured of his <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> continued perfectly well."</Q></P>
<P N="86">86. If the poor cooper remained long in that po&s;ition, <HI>&s;upino dor&s;o &s;uper vas teres,</HI> I marvel that he ever recovered. That the Dutch &s;ailors &s;hould believe that his lungs were full of water is no great wonder: Van Helmont &s;hould have known better. There are, indeed, writers of &s;ome reputation, who tell us that they have found water in the lungs and &s;tomach of drowned &s;ubjects; but, waving the improbability of the fact, later experi|ments prove inconte&s;tably that drowning animals rarely imbibe any water; certainly no quantity to do them any injury. <HI>Mor|gagni</HI> drowned guinea-pigs, hedge-hogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.</HI> xix. <HI>art.</HI> 41.</NOTE> dormice, and other animals, and found on di&s;&s;ection little or no water in the lungs or &s;tomach of any of them. The opinion that drowned per&s;ons are full of water, erroneous as it certainly is, prevails &s;o univer&s;ally among the ignorant, that I am per&s;uaded many have been prevented from recovering by holding them up by the heels, or laying them on the &s;ide of a hill, with the head downwards.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="64">
<P N="87">87. The&s;e Dutch &s;kippers told Van Helmont, that a &s;alt herring applied imme|diately to the wound was an infallible cure for the bite of a mad dog, and that half drowning in &s;alt water was only ne|ce&s;&s;ary when this remedy had been neglected; &s;o that we have neither the au|thority of Cel&s;us, nor the practice of the Netherlands, to plead in favour of &s;ea-bathing as a pre&s;ervative. The ca&s;e of this cooper, if we believe that he was really &s;o mad as to require being fettered, affords a &s;ingular example of the hydrophobia actually cured by immer&s;ion in &s;alt water: it is indeed &s;o &s;ingular, that I can pro|duce but one more on any tolerable au|thority. The in&s;tances in which it has failed, as a prophylactic remedy and cure for the hydrophobia, are innumerable.</P>
<P N="88">88. Morgagni, <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> viii. <HI>Art.</HI> 23. tells us, that an hydrophobiac patient was thrown into a cold bath, and held &s;ome time under water: he died the night after. &mdash;In <HI>Art.</HI> 25, we read of another who died &s;oon after he was taken out of the bath. &mdash;<HI>Art.</HI> 26.

<PB N="63" REF="65">recorded in the hi&s;tory of the Academy of Sciences at Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ann.</HI> 1699.</NOTE> Morgagni writes thus: <Q>"Immer&s;ion in cold water mu&s;t have &s;ucceeded very differently with others; &s;ince, be&s;ide <HI>Baccius,</HI> and him whom <HI>Parry</HI> pointed out, not only <HI>Salius</HI> has written that he, after &s;everal times experience, had found no advantage from this remedy, but al&s;o <HI>Caelius Aure|lianus</HI> expre&s;sly di&s;commended it, as injurious. But <HI>Palmarius</HI> has admo|ni&s;hed us, that it was certain, from the experience of many, that this method of treatment had been very un&s;ucce&s;s|ful."</Q></P>
<P N="89">89. <HI>Boerhaave's</HI> directions for bathing the patient in the &s;ea, or in a river,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aph.</HI> 1143.</NOTE> are very &s;ingular.&mdash;<Q>"Immediately after in|fection, with great preparation, ex|citing fear, and after frequent threat|nings, at la&s;t throw him into the water."</Q> &mdash;He then repeats the orders given by Cel&s;us for half-drowning the patient: <Q>"for (he adds) the cure is effected by the perturbation of the mind <HI>(&s;piritum tur|bando)</HI> agitation of the animal &s;pirits, and not by the &s;alt water, as we learn
<PB N="64" REF="66">from the deplorable exit of the man who, after being bitten by a mad dog, was &s;hip-wrecked and &s;wam a long time in the &s;ea, frequently covered by the waves, yet died of the hydropho|bia."</Q>&mdash;This being the ca&s;e, threatning to <HI>hang</HI> the patient would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e.

<P N="91">91. I pre&s;ume the reader is, by this time, &s;atisfied as to the efficacy of bathing. The rea&s;on why it continues, in the pre&s;ent age, to be u&s;ed as a prophylactic remedy for the bite of a mad dog, is the &s;ame which may be a&s;&s;igned for a thou&s;and other fooli&s;h cu&s;toms&mdash;<HI>our fathers did &s;o before us;</HI> and their rea&s;on was, that <HI>their</HI> fathers did &s;o before <HI>them:</HI> but from what theory the inventor of this remedy deduced his pre&s;cription is not ea&s;ily imagined. All medicines mu&s;t have ori|ginated either in rea&s;oning <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> or from &s;ome fortuitous event. The fir&s;t, I think, is, in this ca&s;e, out of the que&s;tion: I conclude, therefore, that &s;ome per&s;on bit by a dog, &s;uppo&s;ed to be mad, ac|cidentally fell into a hor&s;e-pond. He continued well; <HI>ergo,</HI> the hydrophobia was prevented by a ducking.

I &s;hall &s;elect a few however which, doubtle&s;s, the reader will think too important to be neglected: &mdash;<Q>"Let the patient's chamber be to|lerably warm and light&s;ome.&mdash;Let the part that was bitten be covered with a piece of clean warm flannel.&mdash;If it be nece&s;&s;ary to bleed him, let the blood be received in the hand of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant, le&s;t the noi&s;e of its falling into the ba&s;on &s;hould affect the patient.&mdash;Talk to him about wa&s;hing and drinking, and, if he hears this patiently, you may then give him &s;omething to drink; if not, you may let him &s;uck through the &s;pout of a tea-pot, covering his eyes or darkening the room.&mdash;Let his nur&s;es be di&s;crete and not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurelianus did not mean female nur&s;es.</NOTE> loquacious.&mdash; Let his head be &s;haved.&mdash;Let him be exerci&s;ed in a hammock or a &s;edan.&mdash; If he refu&s;es to take any liquid in at his mouth, force it into the other end of him; but, take care that you do not

This perilous operation being happily accompli&s;hed, you are then to &s;quee&s;e his, or her, belly, &s;o as to force the contents up|wards, and thereby quench the patient's thir&s;t. <HI>Tullius Ba&s;&s;us</HI> (&s;ays our author) be&s;ides cly&s;ters gave his patients a pinch or two of &s;nuff; who&s;e friend Dr. <HI>Black</HI> gave <HI>white</HI> hellebore, of which &s;ome phy&s;icians order a catapla&s;m to the patient's back&s;ide."</Q></P>
<P N="93">93. <Q>"Paracel&s;us (&s;ays Van Helmont) affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demen's idea,</HI> p. 287.</NOTE> that the hydrophobia might be cured by acrid purgatives. His pro|mi&s;es, however, are not ju&s;tified by the event. Our good Catholics, therefore, de&s;pairing of relief from the faculty, repair to St. Hubert, at who&s;e &s;hrine, by virtue of certain ceremonies, they are cured; but, it is worthy of remark, that if the&s;e ceremonies are not &s;trictly ob&s;erved, the latent <HI>rabies</HI> immediately breaks out, and they become irreco|verably hydrophobic. There is a ve&s;t|ment of St. Hubert's, which is pre|&s;erved in a che&s;t, &s;ecured by &s;ix locks,
<PB N="69" REF="71">the keys of which are kept by &s;ix dif|ferent Vergers. For the&s;e four&s;core years pa&s;t they have been continually cutting off pieces from this holy ve&s;t|ment; neverthele&s;s it remains, to this day, perfectly entire. Now, it is im|po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any impo&s;ture in the ca&s;e; for they have never been able to di&s;cover whether this miraculous robe be of linen, woollen, or of &s;ilk, con&s;equently it cannot be annually re|newed. They cut off a piece of the robe, and incarnate a thread between the &s;kin of the patient's forehead. Hence another miracle; for a per&s;on thus cured becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power to po&s;tpone the hydrophobia during forty days in any of his acquaintance, who, after being bitten, may not have lei&s;ure immediately to vi&s;it St. Hubert: on this condition, however, that if they exceed the forty days ever &s;o little, without applying for a prorogation of the term, they go mad irrecoverably."</Q></P>
<P N="94">94. Tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with books on this &s;ubject, will a&s;k, why I have taken no notice of the celebrated
<PB N="70" REF="72">powder invented by Palmerius?&mdash;I have two rea&s;ons: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e it <HI>de&s;erves</HI> no notice; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> becau&s;e it is never pre|&s;cribed in this kingdom, and therefore can do no mi&s;chief. I have omitted &s;everal other <HI>infallible</HI> medicines for the &s;ame rea&s;on. An idle di&s;play of medical eru|dition on &s;o trite a &s;ubject were ridiculous. I &s;at down &s;olely with a de&s;ign to con|vince the le&s;s informed part of the com|munity, that their opinions concerning the prevention of canine madne&s;s, or <HI>hydrophobia,</HI> are fatally erroneous, ina&s;|much as that dependence precludes the application of more rational means. I determined to employ a few lei&s;ure hours on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e Boerhaave, Mead, and other phy&s;icians of high reputation, have authori&s;ed &s;uch irrational dependence.</P>
<P N="95">95. But this is not the &s;ole mi&s;chief of which the erroneous opinions of eminent men are productive. Dr. Mead, fully per&s;uaded of the all-&s;ufficiency of his <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us,</HI> endeavours mo&s;t irra|tionally, to divert his readers from an attention to the wound. The&s;e are his words&mdash;<Q>"The ancient phy&s;icians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 88.</NOTE> who are
<PB N="71" REF="73">followed in this by the moderns, advi&s;e, where the place will admit of it, to enlarge the wound by inci&s;ion; to ap|ply a cupping-gla&s;s; to burn it with a hot iron, and to keep a di&s;charge from the ulcer for many days. I cannot but &s;ay, that I think all this &s;everity u&s;e|le&s;s."</Q>&mdash;<Q>"It happens in mo&s;t ca&s;es that the wound, being &s;mall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 89.</NOTE> is healed up before the patient &s;eeks for help. For this rea&s;on, and becau&s;e it is of no great con&s;equence whether it be cured or not, in the paper which I printed and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome years &s;ince, entitled, <HI>A certain cure for the bite of a mad dog,</HI> I took no notice of any outward appli|cation."</Q>&mdash;I will, without he&s;itation, venture to pronounce this the mo&s;t per|nicious doctrine that ever was taught by any phy&s;ician ancient or modern. It af|fords one of the mo&s;t flagrant examples in the annals of medicine, of a &s;en&s;ible man and a &s;cholar &s;acrificing his rea&s;on, his common &s;en&s;e, to a preconceived hypothe&s;is. He imagined that the poi&s;on contained in the &s;aliva of the inraged ani|mal contaminated a nervous fluid&mdash;which has no exi&s;tence; and that this poi&s;on
<PB N="72" REF="74">might be carried off by a diuretic medi|cine &mdash;which is certainly neither diuretic nor any thing el&s;e. He advi&s;ed cold bathing, becau&s;e, on mechanical prin|ciples, he &s;uppo&s;ed that the external pre&s;|&s;ure of the water, by con&s;tringing the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, would determine the &s;e|gregated poi&s;on to the kidneys, and &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of his <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="96">96. Before I pre&s;cribe that which I conceive to be the only rational means of preventing the fatal effect of the bite of a mad dog, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould an&s;wer a very natural que&s;tion.&mdash;If (&s;ays the reader) the &s;everal &s;pecifics above con|demned are really good for nothing, how comes it that &s;o many per&s;ons bit by mad dogs are daily cured by the Orm&s;kirk medicine, bathing in the &s;ea, &amp;c.? &mdash;If this were not what is called begging the que&s;tion, I &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for an an&s;wer; but the truth is, that all tho&s;e who believe them&s;elves cured by the&s;e futile pre&s;ervative remedies were never infected; and con&s;equently no harm would have happened, whether they had u&s;ed them or not. Fortunately for mankind,
<PB N="73" REF="75">not one in fifty of the dogs &s;uppo&s;ed to be mad are really mad; and of tho&s;e few that are &s;o, their teeth are often wiped clean by the clothing of the per&s;on bit, and con&s;equently no inoculation takes place. It happens al&s;o, as in all other infectious di&s;ea&s;es, that the body is frequently not di&s;po&s;ed to receive the infection. The&s;e, and the&s;e only, are the cau&s;es of all the tran&s;itory reputation which the various <HI>infallible</HI> medicines have from time to time acquired.</P>
<P N="97">97. Neverthele&s;s, as the ca&s;e is always doubtful&mdash;as po&s;&s;ibly the dog may be actually mad, and the poi&s;on really im|bibed, nothing can be more imprudent than to depend on the chance of its being otherwi&s;e: we are, therefore, to act as if we were certain that dog was a mad dog. The per&s;on bit mu&s;t immediately apply his mouth to the wound, and con|tinue to &s;uck it during ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, frequently &s;pitting out, and wa&s;hing his mouth after each time with water, warm or cold, no matter which. If the wound be in a part of his body which he cannot reach with his
<PB N="74" REF="76">mouth, po&s;&s;ibly he may prevail on &s;ome rational friend to do him this kind office; e&s;pecially when I a&s;&s;ure him, po&s;itively a&s;&s;ure him, that it may be done without the lea&s;t danger. My own &s;on, then about eight years old, in returning from &s;chool, was bit by a dog in the thigh. My elde&s;t daughter, being informed of the accident, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation immediately &s;ucked the wound. She had heard me &s;ay it might be done with &s;afety. The dog was certainly not mad; but I relate the &s;tory in ju&s;tice to her affectionate intrepidity, which, in a young girl, was &s;omewhat extraordinary.</P>

Neither ancient nor modern writ|ers, if I remember right, have advi&s;ed &s;ucking the wound received by the bite of a mad dog:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> III. <HI>c.</HI> 2.</NOTE> yet Galen, in his book <HI>de Temperaments,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>that the &s;aliva of this animal is not equally dangerous when ad|mitted into the &s;tomach;</HI> therefore, it is probable that, in &s;ome part of his volu|minous writings, he may have mentioned this experiment. But, in the bite of a venomous &s;erpent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> V. <HI>c.</HI> 27. P. 37.</NOTE> Cel&s;us, and after him Dr. Mead, lays great &s;tre&s;s on this pre|&s;ervative
<PB N="75" REF="77">application. It is very extra|ordinary, that in one ca&s;e the Doctor &s;hould deem it of &s;o much, and in the other, of &s;o little importance. The fir&s;t of the&s;e authors a&s;&s;ures us, that the P&s;ylli, a people who pretended to an hereditary and exclu&s;ive power of curing the bite of &s;erpents by &s;uction, owed their &s;ucce&s;s &s;olely to their re&s;olution; for, &s;ays he, <HI>Venenum non gu&s;tu, &s;ed in vulnere nocet;</HI> adding, <Q>"whoever, therefore, &s;ucks the wound after the example of the&s;e P&s;ylli, will &s;ave his friend, and do him&s;elf no injury."</Q></P>
<P N="99">99. Dr. Mead was informed by a &s;ur|geon who lived in Virginia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mead,</HI> P. 40.</NOTE> that the Indians there cure the bite of the rattle|&s;nake by fir&s;t &s;ucking the wound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is al&s;o a common practice in the Highlands of Scotland. See <HI>Pennant's Tour. append.</HI> p. 275.</NOTE>, and then &s;wallowing a large quantity of a decoction of the rattle-&s;nake root, &s;o as to vomit plentifully. Now, that the de|coction contributes nothing towards the cure, I pre&s;ume will be readily admitted; &s;ucking the wound, therefore, is the &s;ole remedy, which was certainly dictated by
<PB N="76" REF="78">the natural &s;agacity of this people. That this cure is effectual is confirmed by the ca&s;e of a man in London, who, being bit by a rattle-&s;nake brought from Virginia, &s;ucked the wound, and recovered. <Q>"As the poi&s;on (&s;ays Dr. Mead) of this &s;nake is more quick and deadly than any other that we know,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mead,</HI> p. 38.</NOTE> a remedy for this will mo&s;t certainly prove effectual again&s;t that of &s;maller vipers, and all other creatures of this kind"</Q>&mdash;and why not of every other kind? Was not the analogy &s;ufficiently obvious? If the poi&s;on of a &s;erpent may be &s;ucked from a wound, is there any rea&s;on to imagine that the <HI>virus</HI> in the <HI>&s;aliva</HI> of a dog may not? But then the infallible <HI>Pulvis Antily&s;&s;us</HI> would have been of no u&s;e. Seriou&s;ly, I believe, that if this &s;imple operation were immediately and re&s;olutely performed, no other remedy would be required. The be&s;t medicines are often the mo&s;t &s;imple, and tho&s;e which are neare&s;t at hand. We are too apt &s;uperciliou&s;ly to overlook the &s;imple dictates of nature and common &s;en&s;e, to the di&s;credit of our profe&s;&s;ion, and the lo&s;s of our patients. Art, chemi&s;try, com|pounds, and &s;y&s;tems, are the hobby-hor&s;es
<PB N="77" REF="79">of young phy&s;icians; and it is not till they have grown old in the profe&s;&s;ion, that they return to Nature and Hippocrates.</P>
<P N="100">100. But, though I have great de|pendence on this &s;imple pre&s;ervative re|medy, we cannot be provided with too many weapons; offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, again&s;t &s;o formidable an enemy. Tho&s;e who want re&s;olution to attack the foe per&s;onally, will be glad of a &s;ub&s;titute. That &s;ub&s;titute is a cupping gla&s;s, or any other ve&s;&s;el that will an&s;wer the &s;ame pur|po&s;e. If no &s;urgeon be pre&s;ent take a pretty large piece of paper; twi&s;t it gently, &s;o that it may ea&s;ily be thru&s;t into a narrow-mouthed jug; light the paper well, and, having put it into the ve&s;&s;el, fix it tight over the wound, and let it remain in that po&s;ition till it may be ea&s;ily taken off. Repeat this operation three or four times.</P>
<P N="101">101. Ancient and modern writers on this &s;ubject have generally advi&s;ed &s;earing the wound with a hot iron; partly with a de&s;ign to de&s;troy the poi&s;on, but particu|larly with an intention to produce an
<PB N="78" REF="80">ulcer. This, I think not only an unne|ce&s;&s;ary, but a pernicious act of cruelty. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that a particle of the poi&s;on, &s;ufficient to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e, is ab&s;orbed by a lymphatic vein, what will be the effect of the application of a red hot iron to the extremity of that vein, after &s;uch ab&s;orption? Will it not imme|diately &s;hrink and &s;hrivel? and will not the reduction of the poi&s;onous <HI>fomes,</HI> by any external application, be thus effectually prevented?</P>
<P N="102">102. The wound being now wiped dry with lint or tow, let two drachms of mercurial ointment be rubbed into it, and let the part be then covered by a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter &s;omewhat longer than the wound. As &s;oon as a bladder is perceived to have ri&s;en under the plai&s;ter, rai&s;e the edge of it, and let out the lymph; and, in order to keep it running, let it be daily dre&s;&s;ed, during fourteen days or longer, with an ointment compo&s;ed of equal parts of <HI>Empla&s;trum ve&s;icatorium,</HI> and <HI>Unguentum coerubeum fortius,</HI> P. L. melted together in a very gentle heat. Let a drachm of mer|curial ointment be rubbed into the fore
<PB N="79" REF="81">part of the legs of the patient every other night, and on the nights intervening let him take a bolus, compo&s;ed of three or four grains of Calomel, &s;ix grains of Camphore, and a drachm of Con&s;erve of Ro&s;es. If any &s;igns of &s;alivation &s;hould appear, it mu&s;t be checked by a day or two's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and a do&s;e of Glauber's Salt.</P>
<P N="103">103. It may po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;ked, on what foundation I have differed from &s;o many eminent writers in not advi&s;ing immediate &s;carification?&mdash;I an&s;wer, becau&s;e they ad|vi&s;ed &s;carification on a groundle&s;s &s;uppo|&s;ition. They imagined that the canine <HI>virus</HI> was communicated to the blood; therefore they wi&s;ely ordered the blood thus contaminated to be drawn away; but I conceive the poi&s;onous <HI>fomes</HI> to be ab|&s;orbed by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and, there|fore, I prefer bli&s;tering the part.</P>
<P N="104">104. Every per&s;on who, from the bite of a dog really mad, has received the fatal poi&s;on, who&s;e con&s;titution is at that time di&s;po&s;ed for &s;uch infection, and who has ignorantly depended on &s;ea-bathing, or
<PB N="80" REF="82">on any &s;pecific taken internally, will, mo&s;t certainly, in the &s;pace of a few weeks, perceive &s;ymptoms of the approaching cata&s;trophy, called <HI>hydrophobia.</HI> In this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e I fear there is very little probability of recovery. I have, in paragraph 72, perhaps rather wantonly, advi&s;ed intoxication; I am &s;till of opinion that it is an experiment worth trying. It can certainly do no harm. I remember &s;omewhere to have read of opium, in large do&s;es, being &s;ucce&s;sfully admini&s;tered; but I do not find this practice confirmed by experience. Powerful anti-&s;pa&s;modics are certainly indicated.</P>
<P N="105">105. In the 4th paragraph of this e&s;&s;ay, I mentioned the ca&s;e of a young gentleman, whom I attended in the la&s;t &s;tage of this horrible di&s;order. He had been bitten by one of his father's hounds, &s;ix or &s;even weeks before. A day or two before I &s;aw him he complained of a pain in the arm which had been bitten, gradually extending towards his &s;houlder. He had taken many do&s;es of the expre&s;&s;ed juice of Ribwort, which in that country was univer&s;ally deemed a &s;pecific, and had
<PB N="81" REF="83">bathed every day in the river. I &s;aw him about ten in the morning. He com|plained of nothing but a pain in his arm, and &s;ome little difficulty in &s;wallowing. I ordered a warm bath to be prepared, in which he &s;at half an hour with great com|po&s;ure. I rubbed a con&s;iderable quantity of mercurial ointment into each arm, and gave him a grain of crude opium every hour, till nine or ten o'clock at night, without the lea&s;t effect. About eleven he became extremely re&s;tle&s;s, and died at twelve, retaining his &s;en&s;es to the la&s;t moment, without any &s;ymptoms of mad|ne&s;s, or propen&s;ity to bite his attendants.</P>
<P N="106">106. This pamphlet, incon&s;iderable as it may appear to &s;ome readers, was not written <HI>&s;tans pede in uno;</HI> it was nearly fini&s;hed before the publication of Dr. Cullen's third volume of <HI>Fir&s;t Lines of the Practice of Phy&s;ic.</HI> I &s;aw, in that volume, with infinite &s;atisfaction, my own opinion, concerning the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e in que|&s;tion, confirmed by that of my venerable preceptor, who concludes his chapter on canine madne&s;s with the&s;e words.&mdash; <Q>"Whil&s;t the &s;tate of our experience, with
<PB N="82" REF="84">re&s;pect to &s;everal remedies now in u&s;e, is uncertain, I cannot venture to a&s;&s;ert that any of the&s;e is ab&s;olutely inef|fectual; but I can give it as my opinion, that the efficacy of mercury given very largely, and per&s;i&s;ted in for a long time, both as a means of preventing the di&s;ea&s;e, and of curing it when it has actually come on, is better vouched by experience than that of any other remedy now propo&s;ed, or commonly employed."</Q></P>
<P N="107">107. This E&s;&s;ay may po&s;&s;ibly be read by per&s;ons who live in the country, at &s;ome di&s;tance from an apothecary, and con&s;equently, in ca&s;e of an accident, it may be many hours before any mercurial ointment can be procured. Such readers will nece&s;&s;arily a&s;k, what then is to be done?&mdash;Whil&s;t the per&s;on bit is &s;ucking the wound, let a &s;poonful of lard, or tallow, or fat of any kind, be melted, and immediately, with the hand, rubbed into the part, continuing the operation until the fat be entirely ab&s;orbed. Let him then take his hor&s;e and ride lei&s;urely to the neare&s;t apo|thecary, who will proceed as above directed.</P>
<PB N="83" REF="85">
<P N="108">108. On the te&s;timony of <HI>De&s;&s;ault,</HI> and the Je&s;uit <HI>Choi&s;el,</HI> particularly the latter, mercury appears to be a certain antidote for the poi&s;on of a mad dog. The fir&s;t u&s;ed mercury only in the ointment: Choi&s;el, be&s;ides u&s;ing the ointment, gave al&s;o a mercurial bolus. They both &s;uc|ceeded. From De&s;&s;ault's practice we learn, that mercury externally applied is &s;ufficient; but evidence is wanting to prove that mercury taken internally, with|out the external application of the oint|ment, will prevent the <HI>hydrophobia.</HI> May we not, therefore, hazard a conjecture, that the lard or fat of which the mercu|rial ointment is made is the real pre&s;erva|tive? Is not this conjecture powerfully &s;upported by the analogy between the canine poi&s;on and that of a viper, which is effectually de&s;troyed by viper's fat, or oil of any kind, applied to the part? I mention this merely as a conjecture, future experiments may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover it to be a fact: meanwhile, when mercu|rial ointment can be had, doubtle&s;s it ought to be preferred.</P>
