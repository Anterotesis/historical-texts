<HEAD>A LETTER OF AN Eminent Divine, TO THE DISPENSARY PHYSICIANS.</HEAD>
<P>I Had in my Sermon di&s;cours'd, That the Creator of the World had given Rea&s;on to Mankind, to adapt the Governments and Laws to their various Circum|&s;tances; as the Foods and Medicines, which are be&s;tow'd on us in the greate&s;t abundance, have been prepar'd from Ob&s;ervation and Experience, in the different Climates, for the Pre&s;ervation of Life. All the Governments have been and mu&s;t be pro&s;perous, when (as all the parts of our Body are de&s;ign'd for the common Life of the whole) the People &s;hall with Courage defend the Prince, and cheer|fully ob&s;erve the Laws; and when the Supreme and In|feriour Magi&s;trates &s;hall vigilantly pre&s;erve the Properties of the Subjects. The fir&s;t and the greate&s;t Property is Life, which demands the Pre&s;ervation, by the Laws, of the Plenty of all things nece&s;&s;ary to maintain it. As all the Parts of our Body a&s;&s;i&s;t the other, every Subject is
<PB N="4" REF="3">oblig'd to defend one the other, mu&s;t repell all A&s;&s;aults, mu&s;t demand of the inferiour Magi&s;trates their Care of the Publick Welfare. The happine&s;s of Mankind is in&s;ur'd to us on the&s;e Conditions only, and are not lo&s;t and be|tray'd but by our own Follies; as our Health, by Luxu|ry and Exce&s;s, and our Life in Di&s;ea&s;es by the neglect or unhappy application or Medicines. It is Impious to ex|pect Miracles to &s;upply our Negligence of our own Pre|&s;ervation. The Clergy are appointed to act, as the De|puties of the Supreme Power, to admoni&s;h the Prince and the People, to exact the great mutual Duties of Ju&s;tice, Obedience, and the Care of the Publick Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>You will be &s;urpriz'd, Gentlemen, how much this Di&s;|cour&s;e inflam'd my Pari&s;hioners, to debate and di&s;cover if any Care is taken of the People in Sickne&s;s, it has from them recoyl'd on me, and &s;av'd me, as tho&s;e that heard it. I could not vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">it any one Family, but I was mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ibly affected. We are the mo&s;t neglected, tho' mo&s;t op|pre&s;t People in the World. The Poor, the Servants, the meaner Trade&s;men are undone in every Sickne&s;s. We are cheated for one Dram and for one Spoonful of the Reme|dies in a greater degree of Expence, than the Govern|ment formerly did, and now can and mu&s;t &s;ecure to us a Pound and a Gallon of the be&s;t Medicines in the Uni|ver&s;e; and then to multiply the&s;e Frauds, we mu&s;t in e|very Di&s;ea&s;e take the oppre&s;&s;ive, pernicious Multitude of the little &s;hamming Do&s;es. In other Hou&s;es, <HI>Lord have Mercy on us!</HI> VVhat do the Magi&s;trates think, to &s;uffer every Boy &s;etting up the Trade of an <HI>Apothecary</HI> (who&s;e Skill has never been examin'd) and every Vagabond from Foreign Countries to impo&s;e on our Weakne&s;s by a Thou|&s;and Lyes, to undertake all the dangerous Di&s;ea&s;es? Do they &s;ee and hear, that many near them are daily kill'd by their Ignorance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, by the Numbers of Medi|cines, by which only they pay them&s;elves for their deadly Care and Advice? Are they in&s;en&s;ible of all Humanity, of the Guilt they contract, as Accomplices? The Eternal Uni|on
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the Inhabitants of the I&s;land is gloriou&s;ly accom|pli&s;'d, &s;hall we be wretchedly heedle&s;s of &s;ecuring the Union of the Soul and Body of every Inhabitant? VVe mu&s;t imitate the excellent Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Britains</HI> of the Northern Part, encourage Virtue and the Publick Spirit, and repel the raging Libertinage and Contempt of all Order and the Laws de&s;tructive to all Societies. Are the furious Inroads and Deva&s;tations and Butcheries of the Borders aboli&s;h'd, and all the Profe&s;&s;ions of Religion, the Law and Phy&s;ick without defence, laid open to the Inva|&s;ions of every impudent Pretender, with the Arts only and Abilities to cheat and delude the People, de&s;titute of the Advice and Defence of the Magi&s;trates? The VVicked Phy&s;icians and Surgeons are the fir&s;t and Principal Cau&s;e of our Mi&s;eries, they ba&s;ely ju&s;tify to us their wretched Quackery, when call'd in at the Extremity; they vainly labour to mend the Mi&s;takes by contrary Methods, and they improve the Robbery by appointing the &s;ame endle&s;s quantities of the little Do&s;es, many &s;uperfluous and neg|lected, many more than they u&s;e in their own Hou&s;es. The&s;e two Enormous Crimes (the Phy&s;icians and Surge|ons have almo&s;t engro&s;s'd to them&s;elves) de&s;erve Death. The College and the Company &s;upported by the Govern|ment can only &s;ave us. But there are Phy&s;icians and Sur|geons more Hone&s;t and Learned than our Enemies, who would &s;ecure us from this Robbery and De&s;truction, and pre&s;erve the College and Company to improve all the Members in the re&s;pective Arts and Sincerity to the Pati|ents, they are both a&s;&s;aulted by the perjur'd Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of many of both the Societies. Dr. <HI>R.</HI> &s;wears every day he will damn and de&s;troy it; that there is, and &s;hall be no other Phy&s;ician in the Nation but him&s;elf. The large&s;t part of the Phy&s;icians delude us fatally, commending the vile VVork the Apothecary has made, de&s;ign nothing more in the Pre&s;cription than his Profit, ruin their own Profe&s;&s;ion to gain the prevalent Recommendation, the Pre|ference in the Apothecaries favour. There is a Surgeon
<PB N="6" REF="5">of the &s;ame Principles and Morals with the Bravo Doctor, who breaks his Company, and the Improvements and Sub|&s;i&s;tence of his Prentices, that he may be nois'd as the on|ly Judge and Operator. The others, by a deadly piece of Work they are now and then prefer'd to. What will be the Fate of the mi&s;erable <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when the Apothecaries are increas'd by two or three Prentices in all the Shops, when the College and Company &s;hall be de&s;erted, and our Life, and the two Profe&s;&s;ions &s;hall be de&s;titute of the Care of the Magi&s;trate?</P>
<P>You know, Gentlemen, I came lately to my Prefer|ment here from the Univer&s;ity; we have the &s;ame U&s;age in <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge.</HI> The Profe&s;&s;ors are in&s;en&s;ible, that the Faculty is invaded, almo&s;t ruin'd. Do they in|&s;truct the Students in the faithful and learned Practice, to pre&s;erve the Patients and the Profe&s;&s;ion together? I ob|&s;erve the Outlyers affront the College, refu&s;e to unite with it, betray it and them&s;elves, and the Sick, to the Apothecaries Encroachments. Alarm'd with the&s;e Out|rages, I demanded of many of the Apothecaries Phy&s;ici|ans, how long they intended to cultivate and increa&s;e the fraudulent and pernicious Practice? They reply'd with great Impudence, as long as the People cannot di&s;cover it, as long as we mu&s;t live by it. We own, that the Gen|try and People are us'd by us in the mo&s;t filthy man|ners. We &s;hall be call'd <HI>Scavengers</HI> and <HI>Reformers,</HI> if we u&s;e them otherwi&s;e. We have no other ways to come into Bu&s;ine&s;s, but yielding all the Di&s;ea&s;es to the Apothe|caries, 'till Danger or Death appear; we mu&s;t complement the Choice of us to mend the matter, by extolling their great Skill and Care, and by writing two or three Guineas a Day of the &s;mall Do&s;es, let the Ca&s;e be what it will. We will not ri&s;que tho&s;e our only Fees and Reputation, to &s;ave the Kingdom. Many Surgeons a&s;&s;ur'd me, their Ca&s;e was the &s;ame, and oblig'd me with the Information of the Remon&s;trances of your College, which they &s;aid, a&s;&s;ert Surgery as well as Phy&s;ick, &s;old at the <HI>Crane</HI> in <HI>St.
<PB N="7" REF="6">Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-yard,</HI> to which no Phy&s;ician or Surgeon had dar'd to reply, which will amply in&s;truct you, how great, how many are the Calamities of the Sick, from our Trea|cheries to them. The mo&s;t infamous of both heartily wi&s;h, the Government would cha&s;ti&s;e and reform us; but who will call on the Magi&s;trate, who do not know their own Lo&s;&s;es, and Pains, and Danger, and are &s;tupi|fied by the numberle&s;s Forgeries of the Apo&s;tate Phy&s;ici|ans and Surgeons, united with the innumerable Apotheca|ries their Ma&s;ters, and the Governours of the Families?</P>
<P>Your College Di&s;cour&s;es have no other De&s;ign, but the Pre&s;ervation of the Royal Family, the Nobility, Gen|try and People, by the &s;incere and learn'd Practice. The <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary Poem,</HI> writ at the Reque&s;t, and by the In&s;tru|ctions of the Pre&s;ident, and the Majority of the Society, avows the dete&s;table Knavery, and the mo&s;t certain great|e&s;t Ignorance of the Phy&s;icians, as well of the Medicines, as Di&s;ea&s;es. The Surgeons mu&s;t be in the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances with you.</P>
<P>On Saturday Morning, a great part of my Pari&s;h, of the Church and Di&s;&s;enters, fill'd my Parlour. I ob&s;erv'd a Palene&s;s, but a re&s;olv'd Air in all their Faces, as in the Al|lies pu&s;hing the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Ramillies.</HI> Their On&s;et on the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who neglect the Laws, their Property and Life, and the perfidious Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, more cruel Enemies than the mo&s;t raging Tyrant, was as brave, and will gain the Victory. Their Language, I perceive, was taken from your Treati&s;es, which they had read, and of|ten &s;eriou&s;ly debated: The Proofs of every Article are publi&s;h'd in them.</P>
<P>We cry out to you for Ju&s;tice, and our natural and le|gal Right, the Puni&s;hment and Reformation of the mo&s;t impious Practi&s;ers, who betray the only po&s;&s;ible Improve|ment of the young Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, who com|bine with the Apothecaries to have us forc'd to take their illegal, unexamin'd, unlicens'd Advice, by the in&s;uffera|ble Payments for the Medicines; we are compell'd to
<PB N="8" REF="7">hazard and lo&s;e our Life, imploying them from the intole|rable Expence, and kill the Growth of the Knowledge of the two Profe&s;&s;ions. You inform'd us from the Pulpit, that Providence is not, and cannot be deficient in the Pro|vi&s;ion of the greate&s;t Plenty of all the Nece&s;&s;aries to pre|&s;erve Mankind. The Magi&s;trate is the Steward, and mu&s;t keep open tho&s;e Magazines of Bread, the Foods, and all the other nece&s;&s;ary Supports, and invite us to enjoy our Shares of the va&s;t Abundance. Our Government has for|merly appointed the general Medicines of common and mo&s;t frequent U&s;e, to be fold for our Relief, which are all of the cheape&s;t Values: In the la&s;t Age, every Fami|ly knew all tho&s;e Medicines, how to divide or mix them; what were the low Prices of each. This Privilege is now &s;acredly pre&s;erv'd in the other Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> We now are undone, we are plunder'd by the &s;candalous Exacti|ons of one Hundred Parts more than the ju&s;t common Rates. We have together warily examin'd all the Parti|culars; we avow, the Remedies are in the &s;mall Portions of their Do&s;es cheaper than Bread, and the common Nou|ri&s;hments. Our vile Phy&s;icians and Surgeons are the Contrivers or Abettors of the Cheats of the little Do&s;es, in|&s;tead of the larger Quantities, which they formerly or|der'd the Hou&s;es to buy, and to divide and mix, and u&s;e in the more ea&s;ie Ca&s;es: we are now pillag'd by them in the Proportions of 40, 50, 100 to one. VVe are forc'd to explain it to you, by a vulgar, but mo&s;t in&s;tructive Example. If my Phy&s;ician or Surgeon advi&s;e me to take Old <HI>Malaga</HI> VVine, &s;hall they permit me to &s;end for it to the Vintner's, at 2 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> and 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> the Quart, or &s;hall they add a ful&s;ome Syrup to deceive me, to alter the Colour, to make it more nau&s;eous and unwhol&s;ome? Contrive with the Vintner to &s;end it in by his Boys in di|minutive Parcels, that the one Quart &s;hall draw five Pounds out of me? Do not the Fools engage me to &s;tick clo&s;e to the Vintner and his Boys, and to command them to advi&s;e us? Since we mu&s;t pay five Guineas for every
<PB N="9" REF="8">Quart of <HI>Malaga,</HI> we will make them &s;ave us all their Fees.</P>
<P>They &s;aw me trembling, I was a&s;&s;ur'd of their Affe|ction, but they ru&s;h'd on me with a Rage not to be ex|pre&s;s'd to you. I paid &s;ix Guineas for the Vulgar <HI>Bitter Decoction,</HI> &s;ent in the &s;mall Gla&s;&s;es, and the Ingredients were heretofore, and may now be had for one Shilling. The 2 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> I paid 30 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for <HI>Perle Juleps</HI> in 14 Days, when one of them is worth but 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> Then the 3 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR><HI>Venice Treacle, Dia&s;cordium&punc; Mithridate,</HI> are very cheap in the Pound. I paid two G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">neas every day, in a long Sickne&s;s, for the <HI>Dram Boles</HI> of them and the &s;mall Draught to wa&s;h them down. Then a 4th. the common <HI>Cordial Powders</HI> are not worth a Farthing a piece. I knew a poor Woman reduc'd to Beggary, by a Crown for every one of many of them every day &s;he was &s;ick, 'till a Charitable Phy&s;ician made the Cure in a Week, with the Charge of one of them. They all join'd in one Voice and Shout, We are <HI>Mer|chants,</HI> we are <HI>Di&s;tillers, Druggi&s;ts,</HI> we have in our long Services for our Ma&s;ters abroad, in all the Parts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> &s;een the more hone&s;t, and the va&s;tly greater Suc|ce&s;&s;es of the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, and we know the low Rates of many dome&s;tick Remedies lately communi|cated to us by our faithful Phy&s;icians of the Di&s;pen&s;ary As God is the Pre&s;erver of Men, the mo&s;t Soverign Me|dicines mu&s;t be mo&s;t plentiful, growing in our own Cli|mates, or imported in large Quantities. Our Rea&s;on, as well as the College, &s;upported by all Antiquity, and all the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians of the two la&s;t Centuries, a&s;|&s;ure us, that the Preparations mu&s;t be mo&s;t facil and ready, rational and &s;imple, not confounded and debas'd by Con|fu&s;ions of Ingredients, or corrupted by long pretended Artifices, only to delude and rob us. But our Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, during the Contrivance to take away our Money, hazard, or take away our Life. They are not able to plead and defend them&s;elves. <HI>Bezoar,</HI> the vilely cheap <HI>precious Stones,</HI> as they call them, the <HI>Leaf Gold,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">are good for nothing, but being indi&s;&s;olvable in us, they do all they can to de&s;troy us: they lie unalter'd in us, in the room of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Medicines, we &s;hould have in their &s;tead. Be&s;ide the Demon&s;trations of the College, we know, they are not Medicines, they are not us'd a|broad. How many Millions recover without them: VVe import into <HI>England</HI> but a &s;mall Parcel of <HI>Bezoar.</HI> You &s;hall hear the greate&s;t Impo&s;ture ever wounded your Ears. They pretend it mu&s;t be in all the Boles and Juleps; all the Remedies are in the Bills &s;tyl'd <HI>Bezoarti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> Our Ima|gination mu&s;t be tickled by the Bill, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">ingui&s;h the A&s;&s;ault on our Money and Life.</P>
<P>I could not &s;upport my Abhorrence of a Crime in all its Circum&s;tances, more abominable than the Plunders on the Road. A Remedy mu&s;t, and &s;hall be found out. &mdash;</P>
<P>They &s;topt me with the Acclamations of Victory, when the Enemy runs. We have the wicked Phy&s;icians and Surgeons under our Feet. Our Impeachment of them will require and de&s;erve your Attention and Patience. Our Government, as in all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> commanded the College to appoint Medicines for the general U&s;e. By this <HI>Book,</HI> the Apothecaries mu&s;t prepare all the Remedies of their Shops. They are, as they mu&s;t be, <HI>perfect Me|dicines,</HI> every one fully de&s;ign'd to an&s;wer the &s;everal Purpo&s;es, without the Delay and Trouble of Mixture, as far as it is po&s;&s;ible to contrive them. The Compound are, and mu&s;t be, every one compleat in the Kind, as the <HI>compound Waters, Elixirs, Confections, Powders, Pills, Oils, Ointments, Plai&s;ters.</HI> The Phy&s;icians and Surgeons have their Reward for their Advice and Fidelity to us, as in the In&s;tance of the <HI>old Malaga,</HI> and are oblig'd to pre&s;erve to us our Right, not to impo&s;e or &s;uffer any Fraud to be impos'd on us. They mu&s;t report to us the Quan|tities of each of the&s;e publick, and our Remedies to be us'd. We can mix (as well as in old <HI>England,</HI> and all o|ther Nations) the <HI>&s;imple,</HI> and the <HI>compound Waters,</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Tinctures.</HI> We can divide their Do&s;es, and of
<PB N="11" REF="10">the <HI>Confections, Pills,</HI> and <HI>Powders,</HI> &amp;c. with the &s;ure&s;t Exactne&s;s. How many Remedies are every day and hour now divided in our Hou&s;es, the <HI>volatile Spirits,</HI> the <HI>Laudanums,</HI> the <HI>Elixirs,</HI> the <HI>Rhubarb, Manna,</HI> and the <HI>purging Salts?</HI> Our Abilities are equal to the Boys in the Shop, and our Cautions to prevent any po&s;&s;ible Errour more powerful than of the playful Lads. They are now pre&s;crib'd by the knavi&s;h Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, in Mixtures of very many of them together, only to di&s;|gui&s;e them from our Knowledge, and the Price of the whole. They are parcel'd by their Order into many little &s;hamming Do&s;es, to extort 3 or 4 Guineas a day, when often we have all of them ready in the Clo&s;et, and the greate&s;t Expence of them cannot be 3 or 4 Shillings. The Government demands, that we &s;hall know the <HI>Mix|tures of the</HI> 4 or 5 <HI>Cordial Juleps,</HI> now only us'd, and the <HI>&V;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Do&s;es of the publick Spirits, Tinctures, Confe|ctions, Pills,</HI> &amp;c. for the common incidental Di&s;orders of our Children, and Servants&punc; All the My&s;tery was in|vented only to cheat us; we are ba&s;ely told, that the <HI>excellent publick Remedies are good for nothing,</HI> unle&s;s they play the Changes on them, by mixing them every hour at all Hazards to blind us, that a <HI>Grain or two more or le&s;s of Di&s;acordiun, Crabs-Eyes, and Coral,</HI> would certainly kill or delay the Recovery. You mu&s;t not now <HI>(the mo&s;t God-like and ravi&s;hing Charity, and of the lea&s;t Expence)</HI> be&s;tow a <HI>Julep,</HI> a <HI>Confection,</HI> or a <HI>Pill,</HI> or <HI>Powder,</HI> on our Servants or poor Neighbours. They mu&s;t be left for the Apothecaries to devour by the Rapine of one Hun|dred to one, more than we could purcha&s;e the Quantities. Our Poor, have by Tradition, &s;ecur'd a &s;mall part of their Property; they run to the Shop for a <HI>Penyworth</HI> of <HI>Sa|fron, of Cordial-water,</HI> of a <HI>Powder,</HI> of <HI>Mithridate.</HI> But their Hearts are broken, they are told they are little worth, if they are not &s;huffled with <HI>Bezoar,</HI> and the <HI>other Impo|&s;tures.</HI> I was then permitted to declare my Re&s;entment, that we mu&s;t <HI>abjure our Religion,</HI> and <HI>throw up our Commi&s;|&s;ion,</HI> if we do not command, that the Divine Benefactions
<PB N="12" REF="11">of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life &s;hall be equally di&s;tributed, by de|nouncing from the Pulpits, and by our Admonitions of the Magi&s;trates of their Guilt, the Ravages of the People, by the Violation of the Tru&s;t we repo&s;e in our Phy&s;icians and Sur|geons, and their Neglect in &s;upporting the legal Powers of the College and Company, to expo&s;e and puni&s;h the&s;e Cri|minals. They &s;hall be compelled to order the excellent Medicines without <HI>Mixture</HI> or <HI>Divi&s;ion,</HI> and to note the Prices. <HI>All the Families</HI> will gratefully receive, and &s;oon be <HI>Ma&s;ters of the mo&s;t gainful In&s;tructions.</HI> We are oblig'd by the Laws to make good all the Robberies in our Coun|tries, unle&s;s we can apprehend the Robber, and convict him. I and you are guilty of all the&s;e Deva&s;tations, if we do not inform our Neighbours, rouze them to join with the Magi&s;trate to &s;eize the Thieves. While I was &s;peaking, my Friends, I perceiv'd, had their Brea&s;t full: <HI>It is nothing,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>that we are cheated,</HI> and the Poor reduc'd to Mi&s;ery; we are hazarded or de&s;troy'd in every Sickne&s;s&punc; The&s;e Collu&s;ive knavi&s;h <HI>Mixtures</HI> are oppre&s;|&s;ive to our Stomachs and Blood, often have no Opera|tion for our Relief, becau&s;e the 8 or 10 perfect Medi|cines (which are them&s;elves compo&s;itions) do violate and ob&s;truct the ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Operations of every Ingre|dient. You will with Difficulty &s;upport your &s;elf, when you hear the Injuries we receive from the perfidious Phy|&s;icians and Surgeons. <HI>A &s;ower, fermenting, roapy, &s;tink|ing, or at be&s;t, &s;ugary and loath&s;ome Syrup</HI> is ca&s;t into the <HI>Juleps,</HI> made by it mo&s;t ungrateful to the Stomach, mo&s;t corruptive of the Blood. The temperate Powders are heated by the Acrid, the&s;e are debas'd in their turns by the ab&s;orbing. The Gentle, and hot, and active <HI>Pills</HI> are mix'd to make a Do&s;e, when one of the &s;orts was intended for the occa&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e or Con&s;titution.

<P>I was almo&s;t deter'd from the Pur&s;uit of my De&s;ign, fearing the Nobility and Gentry would not receive the In|formation, and the common People boy&s;terou&s;ly rage, when a&s;&s;ur'd, that their eminent Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, are only the Setters and Sweetners for the Apothecaries to pilfer them, that they have not the Learning and Abili|ties which will pre&s;erve them in any one very dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e.

To come clo&s;e to my Adver&s;aries, your College demon&s;trated, that the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd, when the Apothecaries are &s;uffer'd to intrude into the Chambers of the Sick, leaving their Station and Duties of preparing, and carefully delivering the Medicines in the Shop, hav|ing no Reward, but what they contrive out of the Multi|tude and Dearne&s;s of the Do&s;es. Their Numbers force them to &s;ugge&s;t all the Forgeries imaginable, to cry up that &s;ort of Phy&s;icians, who &s;hall fatally deceive the People, &s;upport their mo&s;t ab&s;urd and pernicious Advices, and ju&s;tifie and improve the Profit from the many and dear Medicines.

<P>His Maje&s;ty and the Council, allow'd the cleare&s;t: and the greate&s;t Truth.</P>
<P>You then proceed to avow; that it is the greate&s;t Folly, that God has not afflicted Mankind with the Permi&s;&s;ion of any more deadly Infatuation, than to take an Apotheca|ries Judgment, in the tender or furious&punc; Begining of Di|&s;ea&s;es, who&s;e Capacity was never examin'd, to force him to pay him&s;elf what he plea&s;es, 1, 2, 3 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Day, by the Number of the Do&s;es, and the fraudulent Prices, when all the Parts of the Univer&s;e have ob&s;erv'd, that many &s;e|vere Di&s;ea&s;es pa&s;s off by the Strength of Nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted or not di&s;order'd, and that the large&s;t Part of the Medi|cines of our own Growth, are, and mu&s;t be of the lowe&s;t Rates. But that the unhappy People will ea&s;ily be im|pos'd on by the Impo&s;tures of no Efficacies in the mo&s;t plentiful, of the few pretended to be dear, being mix'd
<PB N="26" REF="25">in every thing they &s;hall take, e&s;pecially when the per|jur'd Phy&s;icians are ready to vouch all the Articles of the Forgery.</P>
<P>Your College then, with a Genero&s;ity never to be pa|rallel'd, confe&s;s'd, that the Phy&s;icians Knowledge of Di|&s;ea&s;es was almo&s;t lo&s;t; that by treacherou&s;ly commending every Practice of the Apothecaries, they were by degrees, more and more neglected; that the Di&s;ea&s;e is broken from the natural Types every day, by the improper and hourly intruded Remedies, that pre&s;cribing in that Confu&s;ion of the genuine and unnatural Symptoms, they can never judge of the Di&s;ea&s;e: That their Violations of the Laws of Phy&s;ick mu&s;t de&s;troy all the Patients, unle&s;s the natural Vigour is able to oppo&s;e them, and perform the Cure.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians mu&s;t lo&s;e all the Knowledge of Me|dicines, not able to di&s;cern the be&s;t from the mo&s;t So|phi&s;ticate, not commend or reject the U&s;e of them in the mo&s;t hazardous Ca&s;es, and not di&s;tingui&s;h the true Qualites and Virtues, or judge of the Operations, when they con&s;pire with the Apothecaries to blend together, with the mo&s;t fatal Inhumanity to the Sick, the perfect, complete Remedies, de&s;ign'd to be us'd in their full Power, unmix'd. The Confu&s;ion of them confounds and breaks the Efficacy to be rely'd on. This mu&s;t be the great Art and My&s;tery of the Practice to kill and ob|literate the Peoples Di&s;cernment of their Prices, and their Application of them in the more ea&s;ie and frequent Di|&s;tempers. The Apothecaries will in&s;ult the Phy&s;ician's Ignorance, will affront them, if they pry into the Secrets of the Shop, and ob&s;erve the &s;ingle unmix'd Medicines there, will reject the Pre&s;cription, which &s;hall give the unu&s;ual Trouble of Preparation, in the place of the Vul|gar, always ready to be clapt together, will command the Phy&s;icians, fearing their Di&s;plea&s;ure, never to examine a|ny Qualities or Virtues of any Simple, or contrive any more rational Preparation, or bring to the Te&s;t, any for|merly or lately publi&s;h'd. They will demand in all the
<PB N="27" REF="26">Hou&s;es they govern, their faithful A&s;&s;urance, that they will decry all the Improvements of the Learning in Me|dicines in the publick Laboratory of the College or their own, and report it Scandalous to reflect, what Medicines their Patients &s;hall take.</P>
<P>When the Phy&s;icians of more cultivated Learning and Experience, &s;hall with Reluctance betray their Patients, the Apothecaries will &s;elect the poor and nece&s;&s;itous, and daring Impudence of the Novices, who have not had the Ob&s;ervations of Di&s;ea&s;es or Remedies to compare and form a ju&s;t Judgment of. The&s;e mu&s;t unite and bla&s;t the Phy&s;icians of long Practice and Di&s;cernment of the Succe&s;&s;es of the various Methods of Cure, who&s;e In|&s;tructions and Cautions can only educate and rai&s;e to Perfection the Crude Attempts of the Practice lately begun. They &s;hall never or after the De&s;truction of many of the Sick begin to correct their Errors, and fear there may be more rational ways of treating the Di&s;|ea&s;es and better Medicines to be employ'd.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, and the Lords of the Council, and the Judges were pleas'd to allow the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quences in the Art of Phy&s;ick, and in all other Profe&s;&s;ions, and therefore determined to di&s;&s;olve the Apothecaries Company, to appoint the competent Number in the City. The Application was prevented by the Rebellion breaking forth &s;oon after.</P>

<P>I know our Gentlemen are proud of their Wit and Im|provements from Conver&s;ation, and fancy that Divinity, Law and Phy&s;ick are learned by Rote and by the Ear, and in good Company. Becau&s;e &s;ome u&s;eful, many very ri|diculous Inventions have entertain'd the Age, they ima|gine, that it excells all the preceding times. All before us were nothing to us. The <HI>French,</HI> they &s;ay, conquer'd the I&s;land in the Reign of our King <HI>Henry,</HI> V. the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> &s;ubdued us in 88, that the Reformers of our Reli|on had no Learning, that the Judges and the Lawyers were not regarded, that they had then no Phy&s;ick: That we are wi&s;er than all the World be&s;ide, and have more Courage and Bravery, that they would conquer the <HI>French</HI> &s;ooner, without any Allies. Tho' our pre&s;ent Phy&s;ici|ans are not in&s;tructed by the Profe&s;&s;ors in the Univer&s;ity, nor by any one ever after at all wi&s;er than them&s;elves, tho' they pretend to little Study and Diligence, value them|&s;elves on the general Learning, preliminary only to, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter all the Profe&s;&s;ions, or are very elaborate in Trifles nothing to their Purpo&s;e, they a&s;&s;ume a Cha|racter they have no Pretence to, a Grandeur and Lu&s;tre to cover the Crimes, of which you accu&s;e them. I am therefore oblig'd to deduce the Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ick from its Original, out of your Books, and the Comments on them to the almo&s;t total Corruption and Death of it in our Age. The Records are authentick, your Ob&s;ervati|ons mo&s;t ju&s;t, that the noi&s;y Admirers of the Modern Ac|compli&s;hments &s;hall be forc'd to confe&s;s their Folly and repair the Weakne&s;s of their Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Labours and Indu&s;try of Mankind were ex|ercis'd in di&s;covering the Fruits, and Grains, and Fountains, the grateful and pre&s;ent Remedies of Hunger and Thir&s;t, then in di&s;covering the Caverns of Rocks, and building, in imitation of them, their Securities and Defences from the Cold and the Ravages of the Bea&s;ts of Prey, till they
<PB N="29" REF="28">had learnt from them to a&s;&s;ault and de&s;troy their own kind. The fir&s;t Surfeits and Pains, and Fevers, Brui&s;es and wounds, rais'd their mo&s;t eager Affections to relieve, and the mo&s;t unwearied Solicitudes to find the Medicines, which &s;hould be able in the parallel Dangers to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves. The Plants they had ta&s;ted in their &s;earches after Food, and had rejected from their Qualities and Vertues more powerfully affecting the Palate and the Stomach, were in&s;tantly demanded and apply'd. The natural Cra|vings and In&s;tincts of the Patients were heard and regar|ded, the Aver&s;ions and Antipathies were mo&s;t warily ob|&s;erv'd and recorded. The ob&s;ervations of the various Suc|ce&s;&s;es were made in the view and Inque&s;t of all the little Communities, and pre&s;erved for the u&s;e of Po&s;terity. When the &s;mall Governments increa&s;t and multiply'd to Kingdoms and Empires, the Medical Knowledge of pre|venting and curing Di&s;ea&s;es was proportionably extended. The fir&s;t mo&s;t populous Countries were therefore mo&s;t famous from the Improvements of Phy&s;ick, before all the o|ther Arts. <HI>Apollo</HI> therefore and <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> were immor|taliz'd as the greate&s;t Benefactors, from the great Improve|ments of the Science, which pre&s;erves Life: they were a|dor'd in their Temples, where all the Healthy and Di&s;eas'd made their daily Sacrifices for their Protection and Pre&s;er|vation. Many of the other Deities were neglected, there was no City, where <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> was not addre&s;t to for his In&s;pirations and Communications of the mo&s;t Sovereign Medicines. This alone was the Profe&s;&s;ion, which engag'd the mo&s;t indefatigable Indu&s;try of all the Princes of both Sexes, of all the Nobility, of the mo&s;t &s;agacious Popula|cy, till after many Ages, a great Magazine of Ob&s;ervati|ons of all Di&s;ea&s;es, and their mo&s;t prevalent Remedies had been collected, and the Application committed to the a&s;|&s;iduous Practi&s;ers of the Science. Can it be doubted, that it was in many Centuries advane'd to the greate&s;t Height and Honours, when the Patients and Ob&s;ervations innumerable had made infinite Records of all things inju|rious
<PB N="30" REF="29">to Health, of the unhappy and mo&s;t pro&s;perous E|vents of Millions of Attempts in all the different Di&s;ea|&s;es and their Symptomes. They then had from the Di|ctates of Nature, the good Sence the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have now lo&s;t and cannot recover, to de&s;ire in the fir&s;t Inva&s;ions of the mo&s;t deadly Enemies, the mo&s;t celebrated and mo&s;t pre|par'd Advi&s;er? Navigation and Commerce communicated from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and from <HI>Egypt</HI> to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the Know|ledge of the differences of Di&s;ea&s;es, the various Methods to attempt the Recoveries. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> is not the fir&s;t Writer of Antiquity, he records many before him. There were many thou&s;and of Di&s;cour&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es, and Medicines to furni&s;h his admirable Collection, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime Philo&s;ophy, of the Motions of our Nature, to relieve it &s;elf from the Violences of Di&s;ea&s;es, and in the Progre&s;s of them, and of the mo&s;t powerful Succours of its Allies, the Operations of the Medicines, as many thou&s;and Poets flouri&s;h'd before <HI>Homer,</HI> who inflam'd his Emulation to &s;urpa&s;s them in his Poems, which have never been imi|tated or equall'd. The mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Art was pur&s;u'd with the greate&s;t Ardour through many Ages, till <HI>Galen</HI> in the mo&s;t eloquent and learned Volumes, collected the Hi&s;tories of all the Di&s;ea&s;es, which can afflict us, and almo&s;t all the Remedies, which are able to repell them. Our Gentlemen will rave at my A&s;&s;ertion, but I a&s;&s;ert, that the Genius of Antiquity (when Human Nature was rais'd to its greate&s;t Elevation, when the Governments were &s;ecur'd by the mo&s;t equal and wi&s;e&s;t Laws, when the Courage and Arts of Inva&s;ion and Defence, when the Buildings of Magnificence and U&s;e, the Hi&s;tories, Poetry, Oratory, Painting, Statuary and Mu&s;ick, and all the other Entertainments of Life &s;urpa&s;s our ju&s;t Compre|hen&s;ion, as they explode our pretences to imitation) could not be wanting or defective in advancing the Profe&s;&s;ion of conquering the mo&s;t deadly and &s;tubborn Di&s;ea&s;es to its greate&s;t Perfection. The Gentlemen, who do not under|&s;tand me, will pelt me with mo&s;t terrible Objections: I
<PB N="31" REF="30">mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place reque&s;t them to con&s;ider mo&s;t &s;e|dately and maturely the mo&s;t important Affair they have ever examin'd and refer them to the mo&s;t in&s;tructive Com|ments on your College Publications. There are not many Di&s;tempers, which are not largely treated of in the Writings of the Antients. But they give the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, the infallible Rudiments, the only firm and &s;olid Foundations, on which alone the Super&s;tructure can be rais'd; all the different Symptomes of Di&s;ea&s;es our Nature can be affli|cted with, all their nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences and Events, which will pa&s;s off by the Natural Efforts alone, and which of them require the mo&s;t tender Treatments or the mo&s;t vigorous Oppo&s;itions. As the <HI>General</HI> does not learn to conquer one Enemy and one Army, to be&s;iege one Fortification only: Nor the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> to conduct the Ship into one Port, and govern it in the Storms of one Sea&s;on of the Year. Had they great Plenty of the Medicines? They were Ma&s;ters of the Knowledge of the Qualities and Preparations of all the Plants the Univer&s;e produces. Is a &s;mall Pittance pretended to be lately di&s;cover'd? How va&s;t a Number of theirs are known only by their Names? their Properties and U&s;es are now neglected, bani&s;h'd from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Enquiries and Practice? Our People fooli&s;hly fond of the &s;ufficiency of the Moderns, will be angry our Phy&s;icians &s;hall be commanded to con&s;ult <HI>Hippocra|tes, Dia&s;corides, Galen.</HI> They have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, engro&s;t all the immen&s;e Wealth of Knowledge in their Trea&s;ury. They are the Originals and Ma&s;ter-pieces, which we mu&s;t copy after and labour to imitate. We mu&s;t obey the immutable Laws of Nature they have publi&s;h'd, and every Devia|tion from the mo&s;t perfect is erroneous and ab&s;urd, and in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e fatal to Life. They were examin'd, approv'd, authoriz'd by all the Nations in many &s;uccee|ding Ages; the Di&s;eas'd mu&s;t dye, if they cannot be pro|tected and pre&s;erv'd by them. Shall any one conceit, that the Preparations of their Medicines were not then the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite? Did they take care of their Bread and Wine
<PB N="32" REF="31">only? Did they exceed us in all the Incentives of Luxury and Debauchery, and neglect the mo&s;t potent Pre&s;ervers and Re&s;torers of Life? Their Medicines were prepar'd in the greate&s;t degrees of Perfection, not enervated or de|ba&s;t by the impudent Fallacy to amu&s;e and defraud the Sick, not the collu&s;ive Pre&s;cripts, void of all Virtue and Efficacy to delude, not the raging and violent, wa&s;ting and con&s;uming the Blood and Spirits they pretend to &s;up|port. The Patients had all the natural mixture of their Powers and Operations in the Sub&s;tance, or in the Extracts, or the admir'd innumerable Infu&s;ions in their Wines or other Liquors. But the Art, as the Life it defends, after Maturity declines from its Beauty and Vigour. The Am|bition, Emulation, and rapacious Avarice of Phy&s;icians corrupted it. The Di&s;ea&s;es, the mo&s;t terrible, had been frequently cur'd, and Life extended to the longe&s;t Pe|riods, but in Pain, in the dreaded Dangers, the &s;olicitude for a greater, for a new Medicine, more vigorous they fancy in the fir&s;t Invention, gave the Honours to all the Innovations, the giddy De&s;ertions from, and the impu|dent Affronts to all the e&s;tabli&s;h'd and con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;es of the general U&s;e. The <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> were a&s;|&s;aulted by barbarous Nations they were prevented by their Calamities, from deba&s;ing their Phy&s;ick by the im|portunate Demands, and therefore indefatigable Pur&s;uits of their Phy&s;icians, after the endle&s;s Novelties of Prepara|tions. The Pro&s;perity of the <HI>Arabians</HI> unhappily de&s;troy'd the natural &s;incere Practice, the Contagion from them &s;pread into <HI>Europe.</HI> Our Age &s;u&s;pects, becau&s;e the <HI>Load|&s;tone</HI> was lately apply'd to direct our Navigation, that the Ancients had no Ships, or Commerce: becau&s;e <HI>Printing</HI> was not long &s;ince invented, that they knew not the Art of Writing; that they made War with Clubs and Stones, for want of our Powder and Artil|lery. It mu&s;t be repeated, as the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Point in the Controver&s;ie, that the <HI>Ea&s;tern Nations,</HI> the <HI>Greci|ans</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> who excell'd the <HI>Moderns</HI> in all things
<PB N="33" REF="32">of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Grandeur,</HI> has all the mo&s;t rational <HI>Prepara|tions</HI> of the <HI>Infu&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Decoctions,</HI> all the <HI>Extracts,</HI> the <HI>Artifices</HI> of all the <HI>Bal&s;ams</HI> and <HI>Ointments,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>Externals</HI> for all the various Purpo&s;es; that they were able to comprehend the two fir&s;t and greate&s;t Laws of Medi|cine, that the Remedy, who&s;e Qualities and Virtues have been examin'd, and confim'd by the Experience of repeated Succe&s;s, mu&s;t be given to the Patient without the Load and Incumbrance of many Ingredients of uncertain, of &s;u&s;pected, of contrary Qualities, but only to convey the great Specifick more plea&s;antly to the Palate and Stomach, to bribe the one, and fortifie the other, to receive the Re|medies for the whole Body. The other In&s;tance of their Wi&s;dom and Fidelity, demands our Gratitude and Imita|tion. As the <HI>Fruits</HI> mu&s;t be eaten before they are dead and rotten; <HI>Bread,</HI> before it is dry and mouldy; <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> without Salt, and dry'd in the Smoak; when the newly prepar'd is mo&s;t agreeable to the Ta&s;te, and Appetite, and Dige&s;tion. In this manner, were the Remedies then ad|mini&s;tred: the great Specifick, which governs the Cure, (by altering and reducing the ob&s;erv'd vicious Intempera|tures of the Blood and Spirits) or in&s;tantly powder'd, late|ly extracted, infus'd, or decocted, the entire unevapora|ted Powers were pre&s;ented to the Sick.

The mo&s;t difficult Profe&s;&s;ion in the World cannot be created by the vain ridiculous Pre&s;umptions of any one Impo&s;tor. They were then as grave as the Judges, and as learned as the Bi&s;hops; their Mode&s;ty equal to the va&s;t Extent of their Kowledge of all the Languages and Au|thors. Nothing could e&s;cape their early and indefatigable Pur&s;uits: After the general Learning of the Languages and Philo&s;ophy, nece&s;&s;ary to all the Profe&s;&s;ions, the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors exacted from them the Task of peru&s;ing carefully <HI>Hippocrates, Dia&s;corides, Galen,</HI> the Sacred Oracles of the Art, and compare with them the Comments of the late celebrated Authors: But our Phy&s;ician is a Novice, knows not one Di&s;ea&s;e nor Medicine from the Books alone, as a thou&s;and Books cannot de&s;cribe a Face to be certainly
<PB N="37" REF="36">known, nor make the Colour, Ta&s;t, and &s;trength of any one Wine judg'd of without Errour. They were there|fore introduc'd into Practice by the Profe&s;&s;ors and other Phy&s;icians of Experience, prudently ob&s;erving the pre&s;ent State, the Symptomes, the Progre&s;s, and the Cri&s;es of every Di&s;ea&s;e. They were commanded to make all the u&s;ual Preparations, to examine in their Laboratories, the Qualities and Virtues of all the Remedies. Common Sence and the Experience and U&s;age of Mankind inform us, that all the Arts of Difficulty, and the highe&s;t Importance mu&s;t be taught by the Ma&s;ter and In&s;tructor. Can there be any <HI>General, Admiral, Merchant,</HI> any excellent Arti&s;t without this nece&s;&s;ary Education; and the Ma&s;ter is great|ly improv'd, while he is offering his be&s;t prepar'd In|&s;tructions?

<P>How many Patients mu&s;t they de&s;troy, before they be|gin to &s;u&s;pect, they have err'd in the Judgment of the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, or the ju&s;t fitne&s;s of the Remedy for the Ca&s;e and Con&s;titution? But your College &s;olemn|ly declares, that the pre&s;ent Phy&s;icians, (who never had Profe&s;&s;ors, nor read the Authors, nor learnt the Langua|ges, nor ever had any Guide or Director in the fir&s;t or late&s;t Practice) know not one Di&s;ea&s;e or Medicine. A great Number of the mo&s;t elevated &s;tation of Quality are of the &s;ame Mind, and you have all mo&s;t &s;olemnly de|clar'd it. A <HI>Surgeon</HI> in Print publi&s;hes, that his Art has had no Improvements, has lo&s;t the Knowledge and U&s;e of many the mo&s;t excellent Methods and Operations practis'd by the Ancients. All the mode&s;t Surgeons avow with the Phy&s;icians, the Ignorance of their pre&s;ent Soci|ety, and the publick, as for you, are not wanting in con|firming the certainty.

<PB N="38" REF="37">demand to be excepted from the common and general Su&s;|picions or Accu&s;ations. They dread they are undone, if our People &s;hall be willing to learn (which the Comments on your Di&s;cour&s;es demon&s;trate) that the &s;trength of the Life de&s;ign'd for old Age cannot be overcome by every Gentleman's Surfeits and Debauchery, and every one a|bove the Di&s;cretion of a Fool, wou'd remark, how many <HI>Fevers</HI> and <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and the <HI>u&s;ual incidental Di&s;orders</HI> are heal'd by <HI>Nature alone,</HI> by <HI>Re&s;t, Ab&s;tinence,</HI> and the <HI>u&s;e only of the general Cordials.</HI> The&s;e are Dr. <HI>R.</HI> and the other Phy&s;icians Cures, who&s;e great Fidelity and Dexte|rity are confin'd to the crafty magnifying of tho&s;e high Performances, when the Patient had the good Fortune to e&s;cape the many Neglects, and the many Errors, and the fooli&s;h or vile Medicines they employ. Our mo&s;t a&s;&s;u|ming Surgeons are now detected, by the more mode&s;t and qualify'd, mo&s;t erroneous in their Judgments, unfor|tunate in their Operations, tho' there are many, they dare not undertake.

Our eminent Phy&s;icians and Surgeons are notoriou&s;ly engag'd in the Con&s;piracy to de&s;troy them by their own, and the future Ignorance of all the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, when they betray the College and their Company; the Lectures, the mo&s;t in|&s;tructive Communications, and the great Advances from the mutual Knowledge of all the Members. The Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ities are ingag'd in the &s;ame De&s;igns, not exacting the Study of the be&s;t Authors, not expo&s;ing

Your College has been lately oblig'd to reject from both, when the Candidates had not the lea&s;t pretence to any degree of Merit. Your Examinations have nece&s;&s;arily abated the Rigour of your Statutes, to comply with the Defici|encies of the new Phy&s;icians. If the Profe&s;&s;ors are excu|&s;able, they will plead; that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are mad and will employ a young Phy&s;ician of inexpre&s;&s;ible Impudence, who &s;wears, he is above and &s;corns the Profe&s;&s;ors A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, or any other Councils and Helps of any Phy|&s;ician of long Experience in the World, and that all the Practicers of great Learning and Ob&s;ervation are Fools to him, that he can never Kill a Patient, follow|ing the new Projects of Di&s;ea&s;es, and the lately fa&s;hiona|ble Medicines; that he pretends every Day new Projects of Di&s;ea&s;es, and will give the Remedies in a way peculiar to him&s;elf, never thought of before him. Dr. <HI>R.</HI> claims the Precedence of this new way of treating the Patients, when he had pa&s;t his Time many Years merrily, and had the fir&s;t initiating &s;matterings of Learning, in common with every one be&s;ide: <HI>T. A.</HI> an Apothecary, who never knew, nor had one good Medicine, the Profe&s;&s;or and Leader of the Young&s;ters, advis'd him to drink with the
<PB N="40" REF="39">Tutors, and over the Bottle with them cry down and banter all the Phy&s;icians of Judgment and Experience. Will they call you to their Pupils, or the Gentlemen of the Country u&s;e you, if you allow the Profe&s;&s;or and the other Learned Phy&s;icians, to be better than your &s;elf? T. <HI>A.</HI> at the &s;ame time, plaid his part, and a&s;&s;ur'd the Tutor's ea&s;ie to be impos'd on, and the Gentlemen's Grooms, and that all the other Doctors were rid out, and they could now have him only in the pre&s;ent Difficulty. When he was mounted the Stage, it was a plea&s;ant Part to per&s;wade, that he was the only good Phy&s;ician of the Age, and had then, all the Knowledge he would ever pretend to; that he was then above all others, and even then equal to him&s;elf. This I avow to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, carries its own Evidence in all the Employ|ments and Profe&s;&s;ions of Hazard and Moment. Another of the more pale and &s;ullen Impudence, &s;hews his <HI>Skele|ton,</HI> is the greate&s;t Dr. on the Earth the fir&s;t Year, bla&s;|phemes the Profe&s;&s;or in all his Companies, be&s;patters all the other Phy&s;icians, is forc'd to run away, deludes the greate&s;t Quality to imagine, the little Sonnets in Latin be&s;peak a Man able to allay the mo&s;t furious Vehemence of Di&s;ea&s;es. But can the Phy&s;icians, that drink hard, and the&s;e Poets, take all the Under&s;tanding from all the Na|tion? There is a more potent and latent Cau&s;e, which the College in its Remon&s;trance, has di&s;cover'd to us, fully explain'd in its Commentaries. When King <HI>James</HI> I. made the Apothecaries a Company, the greate&s;t part of the Phy&s;icians were <HI>Gentlemen of Integrity,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the Acqui&s;itions of Learning, of Di&s;ea&s;es and Medicines, by the mo&s;t unwearied Indu&s;try and Study, and their Mode&s;ty applying in all Ca&s;es of Difficulty to the Phy&s;i|cians, the experienc'd Officers of the Art to lead and con|duct them, increas'd their Skill and their Courage, flu&s;h'd them with frequent Victories.

Then we and they &s;hall (as formerly with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure) di&s;tribute the <HI>Divine Bounty</HI> of the ex|cellent publick Medicines to the Poor, or more Indigent of the People, who will not then greedily entertain the Em|piricks from all Countries, when they can receive our Cha|rity of our own more &s;overeign Preparations.</P>
<P><HI>The Clergy, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Gentry are under the &s;acred Obligations</HI> with you, to pre&s;erve the <HI>Honour and Dignity of our two famous Nur&s;eries of all Learning.</HI> We may recover the Zeal of the Officers, by reviving the Re|wards, which their ine&s;timable Services claim from the Cog|nizance and Beneficence of the Court, the Nobility and Gen|try. The Univer&s;ities may be mov'd by us to correct and reform their Phy&s;icians, their perfidious Enemies, who deli|ver them up to the illiterate Impo&s;tors, by the Combinations you have &s;o often detected; that they will not &s;uffer our <HI>Out-lying Phy&s;icians from them</HI> to increa&s;e their Numbers and Power, and <HI>ha&s;ten the Ruine of this &V;niver&s;ity of Phy&s;ick,</HI> our Laws command them to &s;upport. Our <HI>Vigilance and Courage</HI> will be animated by the <HI>imminent Dangers and De&s;truction</HI> of
<PB N="61" REF="60">all Learning in the Nation, from the impetuous Libertinage, which, in the late Rebellion, in&s;ulted on all the Orders and Profe&s;&s;ions. <HI>Religion</HI> now &s;uffers from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, which affect you, from the <HI>Preferments</HI> be&s;tow'd on us by the <HI>Athe|i&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Lewd</HI> and <HI>Ignorant,</HI> with the &s;ame <HI>Conditions</HI> annext of their unmole&s;ted Ravages on all Learning and Virtue, their a&s;&s;um'd Sufficiency to determine in Religion, as in Phy|&s;ick, from the trifling Pamphlets they read in their Mo|ther Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>The Rights of the Chri&s;tian Church</HI> give us Power to admo|ni&s;h the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> to <HI>avoid</HI> the <HI>Guilt,</HI> (which is adjudged unpardonable by all the Divines) expo&s;ing know|ingly the Life of the People to the endle&s;s Increa&s;e and Ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the Apothecaries, and other Unlicens'd Underta|kers. The <HI>Company</HI> will confe&s;s (as an <HI>Apothecary in Print has</HI>) the invincible Rea&s;ons for their &s;peedy Reduction. The <HI>per|petual Swarms of their Numbers, from</HI> 2 <HI>or</HI> 3 <HI>Prentices in every Shop,</HI> and their filling all the Streets, mu&s;t, from the nume|rous Proofs you a&s;&s;ign, threaten or take away the Life of the <HI>Royal Family,</HI> the <HI>Nobility, Gentry</HI> and <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Before old Laws and E&s;tabli&s;hments are pull'd down, and the Rubbi&s;h remov'd, we &s;hould council them to frame a new and better Model, to make the Draught of the Fabrick, and expo&s;e it to the Judgments of the wi&s;e&s;t in the Nation. The Plan of the new Structure is, that the People &s;hall have the liberty to do and &s;uffer what they plea&s;e; to gratifie the pre|&s;ent Rage for Anarchy and Confu&s;ion. They &s;hall be cheated and kill'd by any one, who &s;hall fall into that Trade and Employment. The Government has made a triple Contract with your College and the Company, and impos'd an Oath on all the Members to defend the Profe&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve the Life of the Subjects. You are oblig'd to return your Comm&s;&s;ion, and Reque&s;t to be declar'd ab&s;olv'd from the &s;acred Obligation; that the Societies &s;hall be di&s;&s;olv'd, when they have publickly been declar'd u&s;ele&s;s, to be abandon'd and demoli&s;h'd, as a Fortre&s;s of no Importance. You may move, that the Committees may examine your Conduct and Di&s;charge of your Tru&s;t, when they con&s;ider, what Laws are ob&s;olete or nece&s;&s;ary to be reviv'd. You may both humbly
<PB N="62" REF="61">offer to them (the greate&s;t part of who&s;e Laws, as of the Government and all the Arts are infallible) that the ra&s;h bold Attemps may be allow'd in Ca&s;es de&s;perate, never &s;een be|fore, but are condemn'd and exploded, when the known Me|thods receiv'd and ju&s;tly apply'd, never fail'd of Succe&s;s. The Merchants and other Traders may venture, as Volunteers of an Army, their own, or the Stocks of their Creditors, in the mo&s;t hazardous Projects, new Di&s;coveries and Settlements: But the General will not betray his a&s;&s;ur'd Victory, and forfeit the Honours of his VVi&s;dom and Conduct. The two Societies are a part of the Government, their E&s;tabli&s;hment is in force; the Con&s;ultation will not re&s;olve their Extirpation, if the Mortification is capable of Cure, if they can be re&s;tor'd to their Health and Vigour, and the Support or Defence of the whole.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it is your Duty to re&s;erve to the <HI>Peo|ple</HI> their <HI>Property of all the Remedies</HI> a&s;&s;ign'd them by the Government and College, to make the frequent <HI>Additions,</HI> to amend the <HI>Defective</HI> from the many Di&s;coveries of the <HI>modern experimental Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and the late excellent <HI>Receit-Books</HI> of almo&s;t all the <HI>Cities</HI> of <HI>Europe.</HI> But it is impo&s;&s;ible for you to attempt or perform it without the con&s;tant U&s;e of your <HI>publick Laboratory,</HI> and <HI>the more nece&s;&s;ary and productive Dili|gence of your private and retir'd,</HI> in imitation of all the mo&s;t famous Phy&s;icians, and of our mo&s;t excellent Mr. <HI>Boyle.</HI> You mu&s;t open the <HI>Stores</HI> of your <HI>three Di&s;pen&s;aries,</HI> to furni&s;h the general Remedies to all the Families. You mu&s;t revive the Practice of all Ages, by <HI>advi&s;ing only the Patients in Charity not too remote from you,</HI> that the Sick may hope the &s;ure&s;t Re|covery from the &s;ame Advi&s;er, ob&s;erving the Progre&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;es and collecting all the Ob&s;ervations, they &s;hall pre&s;ent to him. You mu&s;t apply to the <HI>Ld. Mayor, Court of Aldermen and Common Council,</HI> who, by their <HI>Committee with yours,</HI> re|&s;olv'd, that the <HI>Prices &s;hould be &s;ub&s;crib'd in every Pre&s;cription,</HI> that the <HI>Bills</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent to the <HI>Apothecaries, promi&s;ing to deliver them at the Rates a&s;&s;ign'd.</HI> They were a&s;&s;ur'd, that 30 or 40 Shops are &s;ufficient to prepare and &s;ell all the Medi|cines in the large Quantities demanded, the infinite, mo&s;t facil Divi&s;ions being made in the Chambers. <HI>Religion and com|mon
<PB N="63" REF="62">Hone&s;ty</HI> exact your Care of the Sick, to direct your Pati|ents to tho&s;e Shops only, 'till the Government and you &s;hall be a&s;&s;ur'd, that the <HI>Medicines</HI> (lately condemn'd in the eminent Shops) <HI>are not &s;ophi&s;ticated and wanting all the chiefe&s;t Ingredi|ents.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> has carefully pre&s;erv'd to you <HI>the Right of pre|paring and di&s;po&s;ing of the Medicines,</HI> and the <HI>Defence of your Profe&s;&s;ion requires you to invade the Apothecaries, to deter them from the mo&s;t unju&s;t and ab&s;urd Inva&s;ion of your Practice.</HI> Be|&s;ides, the Patient cannot be &s;afe without it. If you advi&s;e the mo&s;t proper Medicine, the Incroaching Apothecary breaks the Heart of all the Sick; It is well enough, a pretty tolera|ble Pre&s;cript, he could have &s;ent in a better. But if he has a wretched Phy&s;ician to bring in, or would &s;et up for the Phy|&s;ician alone, he changes the Medicines, enrages the Impatient again&s;t the Doctor by one of no Operation, provokes the mo&s;t Patient by a violent de&s;tructive Do&s;e, as you prove in many Criminals you expo&s;e. <HI>Your own Intere&s;t will &s;ollicite you to barter and communicate your Ob&s;ervations of the improv'd Pre|parations,</HI> and the Recoveries of the many lo&s;t. But the <HI>Specifick and Appropriate to each Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> mu&s;t be re&s;erv'd from the Peo|ple, who are now craving after the endle&s;s Changes and Shiftings from this to the other &s;orts, and importuning every knavi&s;h Practi&s;er to cheat and de&s;troy them. You will lay before them and the Quacks, as Edg'd-Tools in the Reach of Children, the mo&s;t efficacious Qualities of the Medicines to ca&s;t at, with the known Chances and Hazards, every Di|&s;ea&s;e, which falls in their way. The Surgeons do not publi&s;h their Bal&s;ams and Tinctures, and lend their Knives and In|&s;truments for the grand Operations. The <HI>French</HI> King did not importune our Dr. <HI>Tabor,</HI> to reveal the Remedy he gave to the <HI>Royal Prince&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Nobility of both Sexes.</HI> It is the mo&s;t deadly Poi&s;on to kill the Indu&s;try of the Phy&s;icians, who would retrieve the Negligence and Lo&s;&s;es of this Age. <HI>The Cabinet Councellors, our Generals and Admirals,</HI> do not divulge the De|&s;igns they have form'd. The Painter does not &s;uffer the Face he draws to &s;ee his manner of mixing or laying on the Colours. The Forbidden Fruits are mo&s;t violently coveted. The Fox in the Fable was many Hours eagerly craving the Food in the Gla&s;s, the Tongue could not penetrate. You
<PB N="64" REF="63">mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert to your Profe&s;&s;ion, the Prerogative truly Royal, the mo&s;t magnificent Bounties to the Di&s;tre&s;s'd, from the publick Magazine of the general Remedies pre&s;ented to them, but you mu&s;t re&s;erve the mo&s;t Soveraign for the mo&s;t De&s;erving, and you are above the Fear of being in|vaded or compell'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>the &V;&s;efulne&s;s of his experimen|tal Philo&s;ophy in Phy&s;ick,</HI> repre&s;ents to us the mo&s;t &s;ublime Character in the in&s;pir'd Hi&s;tory <HI>(He went about doing good,)</HI> above the <HI>pretended Glories of ambitious Princes,</HI> who have con&s;um'd their Life, and Mankind by their Ravages and Conque&s;ts. <HI>The Honours and Di&s;tinctions</HI> of the Subjects in all Governments have no other Foundation, <HI>than being &s;erviceable to the Publick, and promoting the common Pro&s;perity.</HI> How great will the Publick Gratitude be to you, when your College &s;hall pre&s;erve the Profe&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t Learned, and mo&s;t implor'd in the greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Pain and Fear of Death? You re&s;tore to the Kingdom its <HI>Right,</HI> its <HI>Property</HI> in all the general Medicines, as a Charity diverted from, and hid from the Poor, the Pious Donors reliev'd.
