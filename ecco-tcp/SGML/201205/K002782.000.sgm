<HEAD>INDIGESTION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT particular &s;tate of the alimentary canal, which is termed INDIGESTION, is known to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the following</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>Diminution, or total lo&s;s, of appetite; nau&s;ea, &s;ometimes retching and vomiting, e&s;pecially in the morning; bad ta&s;te in the mouth, foul tongue, flatulency, di&s;tention, pain and un|ea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;tomach and bowels, particularly after meals; acid and windy eructations, heartburn, and flu&s;hings in the face: &s;ometimes a lax habit takes place, at other times an ob&s;ti|nate co&s;tivene&s;s &s;upervenes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>Intemperance in eating and drinking; with the immoderate u&s;e of &s;pices, &s;trong rich &s;auces, wines, and ardent &s;pirits: The&s;e by violently &s;timulating and di&s;tending the fibres of the &s;tomach and bowels, de&s;troy their natural ela&s;ticity and the &s;en&s;ibility of their nerves; by which the blood becomes vitiated, and a di&s;ordered &s;tate of the whole body is frequently produced.</P>
<P>Defect in either the quantity or quality of the food;&mdash;Moi&s;t warm, confined, or impure air;&mdash;Living in low damp hou&s;es and in the neighbourhood of mar&s;hes and &s;tagnant waters:&mdash; Want of due exerci&s;e;&mdash;A &s;edentary life;&mdash;Inten&s;e &s;tudy.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>The abu&s;e of <HI>Mercury</HI> is another and frequent cau&s;e of Indi|ge&s;tion: many con&s;titutions have &s;uffered more from the inju|dicious u&s;e of this mo&s;t valuable medicine, than by the very di&s;|ca&s;e it was intended to cure; when taken improperly, it injures the nerves as well as the &s;tomach and bowels; and &s;ubjects the patient to the gout, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bility, con&s;umption, nervous di&s;orders, lo&s;s of memory, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and often induces prema|ture old age.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of Tobacco may be al&s;o ranked among the cau&s;es of Indige&s;tion; it frequently pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ves injurious to the &s;tomach when fir&s;t made u&s;e of, either in &s;moking or chewing, owing to the profu&s;e di&s;charge of <HI>&s;aliva</HI> or &s;pittle it occa&s;ions. The injury &s;u&s;tained by the u&s;e of tobacco, will always be in proportion to the lo&s;s of &s;aliva, and its narcotic power upon the nerves,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>EFFECTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Accumulation of indige&s;tible matter in the &s;tomach and bowels: hence proceed&mdash;Vomiting and purging&mdash;Colic, flatu|lent or bilious&mdash;Worms&mdash;Intermitting Fevers&mdash;Large Bellies in Children.</P>
<P N="2">II. Debility of the General Sy&s;tem; producing&mdash;Agues&mdash;Fevers&mdash;Gout,&mdash;Scrofula&mdash;Rickets&mdash; and Jaundice.</P>
<P N="3">III. Irregular performance of the Secretions and Excre|tions; from whence ari&s;e&mdash;Catarrhal defluxions&mdash;A&s;thma&mdash;Con&s;umption&mdash;Diabetes&mdash;<HI>Fluor Albus,</HI> or Whites.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Debility of the Ab&s;orbent Sy&s;tem; whereby the lym|phatic exhalation is not taken up &s;o quick as excreted by the exhalent arteries. hence&mdash;Leucophlegmacy&mdash;Drop&s;y, partial and general.</P>
<P N="5">V. Debility of the Nerves in general: producing&mdash;Pains in the head, e&s;pecially periodical&mdash;Spa&s;ms of the &s;tomach and bowels&mdash;Hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;Hypochondria&s;is&mdash;Lethargy&mdash;Apo|plexy&mdash;Pal&s;y.</P>
<P>After enumerating the&s;e Effects, it mu&s;t evidently appear that, the cau&s;e of almo&s;t every ob&s;tinate, complicated, and in|curable
<PB N="5" REF="4">di&s;ea&s;e, originates in the &s;tomach: and, therefore, though Indige&s;tion has been treated as a trifling complaint, it certainly demands our mo&s;t &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>In order to illu&s;trate more fully how Indige&s;tion becomes the primary cau&s;e of mo&s;t di&s;orders to which the human body is &s;ubject, and to account for tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which con&s;ti|tute that morbid &s;tate I &s;hall here de&s;cribe</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION,</HI> Or, The Progre&s;s of the Aliment, from the Mouth to the Heart and Lungs, with the Changes it undergoes in its Pa&s;&s;age, until it is converted into Blood; &s;hewing by what Law of the Animal Economy the <HI>BODY IS MAINTAINED AND SUPPORTED IN A NATURAL HEALTHY STATE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>After the ma&s;ticated food is conveyed into the &s;tomach, it is there reduced into a &s;oft pulpy ma&s;s; the &s;tomach then more &s;trongly contracts and forces out at every &s;uch contraction, a portion of its contents, until the whole is evacuated into the fir&s;t bowel, called by Anatomi&s;ts <HI>Duodenum:</HI> hence ari&s;es the true &s;en&s;ation of hunger: But, if the &s;tomach through weak|ne&s;s is unable either properly to dige&s;t the aliment or to con|tract with &s;ufficient force &s;o as to evacuate its contents in due time, an unnatural fermentation with an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion take place, which produce the &s;ymptoms of Indige&s;tion; &s;uch as, flatulency, di&s;tention, eructations, acidity; great unea&s;ine&s;s, fickne&s;s, vomiting, pain, and &s;pa&s;m or cramp of the &s;tomach; lo&s;s of appetite, flu&s;hing heats, pain and giddine&s;s of the head, with &s;ometimes a palpitation of the heart, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When the food thus partially di&s;&s;olved, gets into the fir&s;t bowel, it there meets with the bile or gall, and the pancre|atic juice, intended to an&s;wer &s;ome unknown purpo&s;e in the act of dige&s;tion. The&s;e fluids being intimately combined with this alimentary pulp, which they further attenuate and di&s;&s;olve, and
<PB N="6" REF="5">into which they &s;eem to infu&s;e new properties) is pu&s;hed forward through the bowels by their frequent contractions; and the more fluid part (called <HI>chyle</HI>), being &s;eparated in this progre&s;|&s;ion, is ab&s;orbed and conveyed to the blood by the <HI>lacteals;</HI> while the more &s;olid part, thus deprived of every nutritious particle, is evacuated from the body as u&s;ele&s;s. But when the bowel are become weak, through the &s;tomach remaining &s;o for a length of time, this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, they will be unable to contract &s;ufficiently, as either perfectly to &s;eparate the fluid from the &s;olid part, or to evacuate their contents in due time. Hence ari&s;e crude chyle, a co&s;tive habit, piles, fla|tulent colic, head ach; and collections of &s;limy matter in the bowels, from which many di&s;ea&s;es are derived, e&s;peci|ally worms.</P>
<P>The liquid part of the dige&s;ted aliment, being &s;eparated from the &s;olid part by the natural contractile power of the bowels, becomes a mild &s;weet, and whiti&s;h fluid, termed <HI>chyle,</HI> which the lacteals ab&s;orb and convey to the me&s;enteric glands, and afterwards to the thoracic duct, from which it is poured into the left &s;ubclavian vein, and by that into the heart and lungs. Here the chyle is mixed with the blood, which changes and a&s;&s;imilates that fluid into its own nature. This is called <HI>Sangui|fication.</HI> It is from this fluid that the blood is made; and this affords that &s;upply of nutrition which the continual wa&s;te of the body is found to require. I &s;hall now point out</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE OFFICES OF THE BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>The Blood &s;upplies every wa&s;te of the body made by the different &s;ecretions; the &s;ecretid fluids, therefore, certainly are all formed from the blood, &s;uch as the per&s;piration, urine, &s;aliva, bile, &amp;c. It forms every part of the body, both &s;olids and fluids: it repairs di&s;ea&s;ed parts: it forms that hard &s;ub&s;tance or cement in fractures, which unites the ends of
<PB N="7" REF="6">broken bones &s;o firmly together: In &s;hort, it regenerates all the &s;olid parts of the animal &s;y&s;tem, and repleni&s;hes all the wa&s;te of the fluids. Such being the important offices of the blood, it is univer&s;ally allowed to be and it mo&s;t certainly is the principle or <HI>pabulum</HI> of life. But, unle&s;s the blood is con|&s;tantly recruited by a fre&s;h &s;upply of good chyle, (from which as before ob&s;erved, it is made) an impoveri&s;hed and vitiated &s;tate of that vital fluid mu&s;t en&s;ue; con&s;equently the&s;e offices, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to health, cannot be duly performed; nor that wa&s;te, occa&s;ioned by the different &s;ecretions, be properly &s;up|plied. Hence ari&s;e general debility, nervous di&s;orders, gout, drop&s;y, jaundice, and cutaneous eruptions.</P>
<P>Though it is evident that the chyle &s;upplies the blood with its nutrition, and that, i&s; the former is vitiated, the latter mu&s;t &s;ooner or later become &s;o too; yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that, be&s;ides the chyle, the blood in its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs, receives from the external air, during the act of in&s;pira|tion, another principle which is called OXYGEN AIR. This is the &s;ource of animal heat, as well as the cau&s;e of &s;en&s;i|bility, irritability, and motion:&mdash;It is this which empowers the blood to &s;timulate the heart and arteries into action:&mdash;It is this which gives the blood its florid c lour: in &s;hort, this imparts to it the vital principle.</P>
<P>In order to render the la&s;t paragraph more per&s;picuous, I &s;hall &s;pecify the component parts of the atmo&s;phere; this is a body con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;pecies of airs, namely OXYGEN and AZOT, which bear a certain proportion to each other; that is, about twenty-eight parts of Oxygenated, vital, or dephlogi&s;ticated air, which &s;upports life and flame; and &s;even|ty two parts of Azotic (commonly called, phlogi&s;ticated) air, which de&s;troys both. This atmo&s;pheric air, being in&s;pired by the lungs, meets there with the blood pa&s;&s;ing through them, to which the oxygenated or vital air having a greater affi|nity than to the azotic or phlogi&s;ticated air, di&s;engages it&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="7">from the azot and combines with the blood, which at the &s;ame time parts with another &s;pecies of air that has a greater affinity to the azot than it has to the blood: The&s;e two extricated fluids, (to wit, that e&s;caping from the blood, and the azotic air,) combining together, are expelled from the lungs in the form of vapour termed <HI>breath.</HI> This con&s;tant action of the lungs con&s;titutes what is called <HI>Re&s;piration.</HI></P>
<P>But whenever the oxygen or dephlogi&s;ticated air becomes much dimini&s;hed, according to the proportion which it ought to bear to the other component part of the atmo&s;phere in order to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of life&mdash;or, in other words, where the atmo&s;phere is lowered or contaminated&mdash;the blood lo&s;es its natural &s;timulus: Hence ari&s;es a dimini&s;hed action of the heart and arteries; the con&s;equences of which are, fainting, languor, head ach, difficulty of breathing, general relaxation; and, if it continues long in that &s;tate, cutaneous eruptions, and e&s;pecially the &s;ea &s;curvy.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining the air in as pure a &s;tate as the at|mo&s;phere will admit, mu&s;t appear obvious from what has been &s;aid re&s;pecting its wonderful effects: this is quite as requi&s;ite to be attended to, as pre&s;erving the &s;trength of the dige&s;tive organs: for, while the chyle, which is prepared by them from the food, is &s;upplying the wa&s;te occa&s;ioned by the different offices of the blood, the oxygen (received by the lungs from the atmo&s;phere) at the &s;ame time is &s;upporting its heat and action, without which life cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The following circum&s;tances produce a diminution of oxygen in the air:&mdash;Fir&s;t, A great number of people being a&s;&s;embled together in any place, in which the air has not a free circulation, or where its equilibrium is not re&s;tored so quickly as it is de|&s;troyed by re&s;piration:&mdash;Secondly, Large fires in rooms, from whence the external air is in a great mea&s;ure excluded; for the fire, in order to &s;upport it&s;elf, attracts the oxygen and con&s;umes it, whereby the vital property of the air is decrea&s;ed; and, the
<PB N="9" REF="8">larger the &s;ire, the greater quantity of air mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con&s;umed; hence the impropriety of great fires in &s;mall rooms or bedchambers:&mdash;Thirdly, Burning many candles renders the air foul, from the before-mentioned cau&s;e, becau&s;e the flame de&s;troys the purity of the air. It has been a&s;certained that each per&s;on de&s;troys the vivifying principle of a gallon of air in one minute, al&s;o that a &s;ingle candle con&s;umes a &s;imilar quantity in the &s;ame &s;pace of time: which &s;hews that oxygen or pure air equally &s;upport animal life and flame; for, where a candle will not burn, owing to the want of a &s;upply or it, an animal cannot live. The&s;e three circum&s;tances are therefore &s;uch as de&s;troy the purity of the air, and render that element unfit for the purpo&s;es of life; &s;o that in a very &s;hort time, and even in a &s;pacious apartment, any of them mu&s;t prove de&s;tructive to the vital principle of a large column of air: hence where the&s;e unavoidably take place, ventilators ab&s;olutely become re|qui&s;ite.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that water and ve|getables have a contrary effect; for they attract and ab&s;orb the impure air and con&s;equently increa&s;e the vital property thereof: hence the air in the country and that on the &s;ea coa&s;t is more &s;alubrious than that of cities and large towns.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CURE OF INDIGESTION.</HEAD>
<P>I have made u&s;e of various medicines for the cure of this complaint, which are u&s;ually pre&s;cribed in the common routine of the practice of phy&s;ic; &s;uch as bark, bitters, preparations of &s;teel or iron, joined with carminatives, or aromatics, and every other remedy applied for debility of the &s;tomach and bowels: but none of the&s;e have acted with &s;o much &s;afety, or have been attended with &s;uch beneficial effects, (either as, an aperient, &s;edative, or tonic,) as I have uniformly experi|enced during an exten&s;ive practice of many years from the u&s;e of</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<DIV4 TYPE="topic">
<HEAD>THE TONIC POWDERS AND DROPS.</HEAD>
<P>It may, therefore, be nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome remarks &s;hould be made on the admirable properties of the&s;e valuable medi|cines, more e&s;pecially with regard to</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="effects">
<HEAD>THEIR GENERAL EFFECTS:</HEAD>
<P>The TONIC POWDERS evacuate bile, phlegm, and water, which are the greate&s;t impediments to health; hence they be|come highly u&s;eful whenever there is a redundancy of bile or phlegm, or any dropfical &s;welling, e&s;pecially in the feet or legs.&mdash;They promote the natural action of the &s;tomach and howels&mdash;They obviate co&s;tivene&s;s, and prevent tho&s;e complaints depen|dant thereon; hence they are of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice in co&s;tive habits.&mdash;They render the body cool and comfortable; hence they are of the greate&s;t benefit, where there are feveri&s;h, hectic, or flu&s;hing heats.</P>
<P>Many families of the highest re&s;pectability are ready to te&s;tify, that both they and their children have enjoyed much better health in every re&s;pect, ever &s;ince they were recom|mended to take the Tonic Powders; and al&s;o that the expen&s;e of medicines has been very trifling &s;ince they made u&s;e of the&s;e in compari&s;on to what it had been before that period:&mdash;By having recour&s;e to them occa&s;ionally when co&s;tive, and when any unea&s;ine&s;s or pain of the &s;tomach and bowels, or feveri&s;h heat, &amp;c. take place, the con&s;titution will be pre&s;erved from a variety of complaints that otherwi&s;e would happen. What adds much to the value of the&s;e Powders is&mdash;that no age, &s;ex, or con&s;titution, nor any circum&s;tance whatever, can render them objectionable.</P>
<P>While the Powders evacuate the indige&s;tible matter, the TONIC DROPS &s;trengthen the &s;tomach and bowels, and thereby prevent a return of the complaints&mdash;They likewi&s;e &s;trengthen the general and nervous &s;y&s;tem, hence their great utility in nervous di&s;ea&s;es and debility of every kind, however induced.
<PB N="11" REF="10">&mdash;They create an appetite, and al&s;o expel wind&mdash;They have frequently removed the Gout in the &s;tomach, after many other medicines had been given without effect.</P>
<P>When the&s;e POWDERS AND DROPS are properly taken toge|ther, they promote the &s;ecretions, and effectually cure all the complaints of the &s;tomach and bowels, which no &s;ingle medicine could accompli&s;h alone; becau&s;e the DROPS are regularly and uninterruptedly taken in the complaint, and the POWDERS only conditionally during their u&s;e; &s;o that they jointly remove the di&s;order, and re&s;tore to the habit its pri&s;tine healthy &s;tate.</P>
</DIV5>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DIET.</HEAD>
<P>The Diet in Indige&s;tion &s;hould be particularly attended to, which will not only facilitate its cure, but will al&s;o be the means of preventing complaints in general.</P>
<P>The be&s;t food for BREAKFAST during this di&s;order, provided is agrees with the patient's &s;tomach, is</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MILK,</HEAD>
<P>Which is ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and affords a greater &s;upply of nouri&s;hment to the body when the dige&s;tive organs are weak, and with much more certainty, than any other kind of food. In ca&s;es of emaciation and general debility, al&s;o when the powers of nature or the vigor of the con&s;titution begin to de|cline, milk is a mo&s;t excellent re&s;torative diet: it gives to the fluids both quantity and quality in the mo&s;t perfect manner. This valuable fluid, however, certainly does not agree with every con&s;titution; for the ga&s;tric juice renders it more or le&s;s coagulated in every &s;tomach, and &s;o firmly in &s;ome as even to re&s;i&s;t the &s;olvent power of that organ; con&s;equently a variety of complaints mu&s;t en&s;ue: It has never been a&s;certained from what particular cau&s;e this unnatural coagulation happens, neither has the prevention of it been yet di&s;covered; therefore, the be&s;t way is to avoid Milk entirely, where it is found to di&s;agree: for with &s;ome (e&s;pecially children) it produces fla|tulency,
<PB N="12" REF="11">di&s;tention, and pain in the &s;tomach and bowels, great difficulty of breathing, fever, &amp;c. When the&s;e ca&s;es have occurred without any evident cau&s;e, I have ordered the break|fa&s;t of milk to be changed to common tea with only a little milk in it, or water gruel; in con&s;equence of which, the children have become more healthy in every re&s;pect, and have required much le&s;s medicine than before.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TEA.</HEAD>
<P>The quality and effects of common Tea have employed many ingenious pens, and mo&s;t agree that it has &s;ome peculiar effects on the nervous &s;y&s;tem, producing tremors, &amp;c. but, for my own part, I believe, that in nine hundred and ninety nine ca&s;es out of a thou&s;and, it agrees very well, e&s;pecially the black &s;ort. After &s;tudy or fatigue, Tea is a mo&s;t grateful repa&s;t; as it quenches thir&s;t and cheers the &s;pirits, without heating the body. Whatever bad effects have been apparently produced by the u&s;e of this valuable plant, they have evidently ari&s;en from drinking it too &s;trong, too hot, in too large a quantity, or in too great a hurry: whereby a temporary relaxation is induced over the whole &s;y&s;tem, and con&s;equently faintne&s;s and trem|bling may en&s;ue. However when neither milk nor common tea are perfectly agreeable to the patient,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GINGER, OR ORANGE-PEEL TEA,</HEAD>
<P>May be &s;ub&s;tituted, the&s;e are made by putting &s;o much of either in a tea-pot of boiling water, as will ju&s;t give it an agreeable flavour, not too &s;trong, to which a &s;uitable quantity of milk and &s;ugar may be added. It is nece&s;&s;ary to caution the patient again&s;t the too liberal u&s;e of hot watery fluids, as that would increa&s;e the debility of the &s;tomach already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>COFFEE</HEAD>
<P>Strengthens the &s;tomach, a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, is grateful to the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, and &s;erviceable in head achs, and lan|guor from over-exerci&s;e either of body or mind. To tho&s;e of lax fibres, and to cold phlegmatic con&s;titutions, coffee will be
<PB N="13" REF="12">found more beneficial than tea, being warmer and more aro|matic; but, on the contrary, with &s;uch as are of a dry &s;an|guineous habit of body, it is le&s;s proper.</P>
<P>For abating the fits of a periodical a&s;thma, &s;trong coffee is recommended by Sir JOHN PRINGLE, which he affirms to be the be&s;t remedy he was ever acquainted with; for which pur|po&s;e, he directs an ounce of the be&s;t Mocha coffee to be made into a &s;ingle di&s;h; and this is to be repeated, after the interval of a quarter or half an hour, but it mu&s;t be drank without milk or &s;ugar: Sir JOHN FLOYER, who wrote a very ingenious Treati&s;e on the A&s;thma, was long afflicted with that di&s;order; but, during the latter years of his life, he was kept free from (or, at lea&s;t, lived more ea&s;y under) that complaint, by the u&s;e of very &s;trong coffee.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CHOCOLATE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ANIMAL FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>A Mixture of Animal and Vegetable Food affords the mo&s;t whole&s;ome diet, and the greate&s;t nouri&s;hment: Animal food tends to induce corpulency and too great a fulne&s;s of the blood ve&s;&s;els; vegetable food, on the contrary, is &s;ound too weak a diet for many con&s;titutions, and therefore would be improper to live upon alone, though it would be much the &s;afe&s;t of the two; but in regulating the exact proportion that

<P>People who are afflicted with Indige&s;tion, General Relaxa|ation, Nervous Di&s;ea&s;es, and Gouty Complaints, &s;hould ever remember that the body is not nouri&s;hed in proportion to the quantity of food received into the &s;tomach, but according to the degree of perfection with which it is dige&s;ted; and therefore however &s;imple the food may be, more &s;hould never be eaten than will &s;it perfectly ea&s;y on the &s;tomach: overloading that organ di&s;turbs the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, and prevents the proper returns of appetite. Nothing is of &s;o much importance to invalids, and per&s;ons of weak or debilitated con&s;titutions, as a proper attention to the quantity of their food; though many people appear to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch powers of dige&s;tion, that they never &s;eem to be incommoded therewith; yet the gene|rality of mankind are affected with unea&s;ine&s;s; and how often do we hear &s;uch per&s;ons complaining of the ill effects of this or that particular kind of food, when the quantity of all, rather than the di&s;agreement of any, is the cau&s;e of their complaints. The Author of Nature has &s;o formed us that it is evident we are de&s;igned to live on any part of the globe. Our organs of dige&s;tion are &s;o con&s;tructed, that we may gradually accommo|date our&s;elves to aliment of every quality; but this is not the ca&s;e in regard to quantity; Nature, by degrees, may be ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ubdue and change into nutriment almo&s;t every part of the a creation, but to quantity &s;he yields.</P>

<P>MUTTON, VENISON, BEEF, VEAL, and LAMB.&mdash;The&s;e are very whole&s;ome meats; and if roa&s;ted, and eaten with &s;uch vegetables as are found to agree with the &s;tomach, the better.</P>
<P>Broths or Soups &s;carcely ever agree with weak &s;tomachs, becau&s;e they relax that organ; therefore, they are dige&s;ted flower, and with more difficulty, and are of a le&s;s nutritious quality, than &s;olid animal food.

<P>Fried meat, or that baked in a pie, is more difficult of &s;olution than that which is moderately roa&s;ted or boiled.</P>
<P>Animal food, if kept &s;ome time after it is killed, before it is u&s;ed, becomes more tender and ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion Meat &s;omewhat rare, is more &s;oluble in the &s;tomach, and affords more nouri&s;hment than that which is perfectly or over done.</P>
<P>It is a common notion that the Gravy of meat is unwhole|&s;ome; on the contrary, it is very nutritive, and is always proper when animal food is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The fat of meat is nutritious, and more &s;oluble than the lean; but, like butter and oil, it is apt to di&s;order the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>SALTED MEAT, when frequently u&s;ed, is unwhole|&s;ome; being very difficult of dige&s;tion, it vitiates the blood and other circulating fluids But a moderate quantity of &s;alt, taken with our food &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>High-&s;ea&s;oned food &s;hould be avoided, becau&s;e it excites an unnatural appetite, &s;timulates and heats the &s;tomach, and eventually de&s;troys its tone. Pepper and Ginger are the mo&s;t heating Spices; therefore they &s;hould be u&s;ed with great moderation.</P>

<P>Vegetables ate le&s;s &s;timulant and le&s;s nouri&s;hing, but more cooling than animal food; they are generally con&s;idered as flatulent. As this quality, however, is never perceived by per&s;ons who&s;e &s;tomach and bowels are in a healthy &s;tate, flatu|lency may rea&s;onably be imputed to debility of the&s;e organs, rather than to the aliment it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now con&s;ider a few of tho&s;e vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, which are chiefly employed as food.</P>
<P>BREAD affords more nouri&s;hment than mo&s;t other vege|table &s;ub&s;tances, but it it inferior to animal food, both in this re&s;pect and in facility of dige&s;tion. It &s;hould not be eaten, till twenty-four hours after it is baked.</P>
<P>RICE is highly nutritious, and more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted than bread, &s;eldom occa&s;ions acidity or flatulency, and perhaps is the mo&s;t whole&s;ome grain that is u&s;ed by man. The univer&s;al opinion, that Rice is of an a&s;tringent nature, is founded in error. It is generally pre&s;cribed very judiciou&s;ly as a diet in purgings, and debility of the dige&s;tive organs, becau&s;e it produces le&s;s di&s;turbance to the &s;tomach and bowels in dige&s;ting than any other aliment.</P>
<P>POTATOES are more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted than bread; but they afford le&s;s nouri&s;hment than either rice or bread, owing chiefly to the large quantity of water contained in their &s;ub|&s;tance. Potatoes, a&s;paragus, and artichokes, often agree with weak &s;tomachs, when cabbage, carrots, and onions, &amp;c. will not.</P>

<P>BIET ROOT contains a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;ugar, con&s;equently it is nouri&s;hing and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Celery, Lettuce, endive, raddi&s;h, cucumber, and melon, which have not been &s;ubjected to the action of fire, contain the whole quantity of their fixed air, and are therefore more diffi|cult of &s;olution than other vegetables.</P>
<P>It is a fact worthy of remark, that the boiling of vegetables thoroughly extricates a quantity of fixed air, which renders them le&s;s liable to produce flatulency or wind.</P>
<P>BUTTER, and the expre&s;&s;ed Oil of Vegetables, are ex|tremely nutritive; but they are difficult of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>EGGS are nutritious, and are very light food when mode|rately boiled</P>
<P>FRUITS.&mdash;The&s;e, in general, afford a mild and whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment, and a proper u&s;e of them greatly contributes to the pre&s;ervation of health. It is a mi&s;taken notion, that tho&s;e complaints of the &s;tomach and bowels which happen in &s;ummer and autumn, ari&s;e from the quantity of Fruit taken at that time: When we con&s;ider the nature of the &s;ecreted fluids, which, at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of the year, have a putrid tendency; together with a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;tate of the air; we mu&s;t rea&s;onably conclude, from the ace&s;cent quality of Fruits; that a moderate u&s;e of them would not only tend to cure, but would in a great mea&s;ure prevent tho&s;e bilious di&s;orders &s;o u&s;ual at the latter end of &s;ummer. Ripe fruit extingui&s;hes thir&s;t, moderates heat, opens the body, and affords a mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;ation to the &s;tomach. Dried fruits are more nutritive than the green, though le&s;s &s;oluble in the &s;tomach. Fruit of every kind is very improper after a full meal.</P>
<P>ACIDS, when moderately u&s;ed, are grateful to the &s;tomach, a&s;&s;i&s;t the appetite, and promote dige&s;tion: but the too liberal u&s;e of them often di&s;orders the &s;tomach and bowels, and, it has been a&s;&s;erted, occa&s;ions a return of the gout.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
<P>SUGAR is the mo&s;t nutritive thing in nature; therefore the &s;accharine part of vegetables is very ju&s;tly thought to afford the greate&s;t nouri&s;hment. Honey and Sugar po&s;&s;e&s;s this &s;accharine principle in its mo&s;t concentrated &s;tate; and, where they agree, if u&s;ed in moderation, are very whole|&s;ome.</P>
<P>NUTS are certainly nouri&s;hing, but difficult of dige&s;tion;&mdash;hence the impropriety of introducing &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances in de&s;erts, when the &s;tomach is &s;ufficed with other food. Nuts &s;hould always be eaten in great moderation; for too large a quantity of them oppre&s;&s;es the &s;tomach, excites pain, and di&s;turbs the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion.</P>

<P>The&s;e mu&s;t be of that hind which will be&s;t agree with the patient's &s;tomach, and produces the lea&s;t heat, wind, or di&s;tention.</P>
<P>MALT LIQUORS are certainly the mo&s;t &s;alutary, as well as the mo&s;t natural to the con&s;titution: They are perfectly well calculated to dilute the food and quench thir&s;t; and when they agree with the &s;tomach, they promote dige&s;tion and procure &s;leep. They &s;hould be taken cold; becau&s;e, when drank warm, they are the mo&s;t apt to produce wind.</P>
<P>TABLE BEER, well brewed, and of a due &s;trength and age, in my opinion, is the be&s;t drink in the world for ge|neral u&s;e: and it was &s;trongly recommended by the great Dr. SYDENHAM. But where it cannot be kept long without turn|ing four, it generates flatulency or wind, and is therefore im|proper.</P>
<P>PORTER or home-brewed ALE, of a moderate &s;trength, is a very good drink at meal times, e&s;pecially at &s;upper.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="21">
<P>WINE&mdash;If malt liquors cannot be admitted, owing to their producing an unnatural fermentation in the &s;tomach, and cau&s;ing wind, White wine and water is an excellent light liquor; and, if it does not turn acid on the &s;tomach, may be allowed for common drink. After dinner, a few gla&s;&s;es of wine may be taken, provided the patient has been accu&s;to|med to a full diet. Wine moderately u&s;ed is not only of &s;er|vice to tho&s;e who are troubled with Indige&s;tion, but al&s;o to per&s;ons advanced in life, or where nature is on the decline; in general relaxation, and in all low, nervous, paralytic, and drop&s;ical ca&s;es. Where the patient has been in the habit of living very freely, the quantity of wine &s;hould be dimini&s;hed by degrees. Wines of good body and proper age, &s;hould be cho&s;en, &s;uch as Madeira, Port, Sherry, &amp;c. the &s;mall wines being more apt to turn acid in the &s;tomach, and interrupt di|ge&s;tion. It may be nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that the quality of wine chiefly depends on the &s;tate in which the grape is gathered, which is always influenced by the &s;ea&s;on: the pro|duce of one year, therefore, is frequently preferable to that of another. When the wine is made from unripe fruit, it will be productive of bad con&s;equences to the con&s;titution; this often gives ri&s;e to a &s;u&s;picion of its being &s;ophi&s;ticated.</P>
<P>The immoderate u&s;e of wine is injurious to every per&s;on, more particularly to &s;tudious men, as it increa&s;es tho&s;e com|plaints of the &s;tomach and head which &s;tudy may have in|duced: tho&s;e who drink too freely of wine are particularly &s;ubject to the gout; while on the contrary, tho&s;e who confine them&s;elves to drinking malt liquors or water, are &s;eldom affected with that complaint. A bottle of wine a day is cer|tainly too much for any per&s;on who prefers health to plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that the &s;tomach &s;hould be pre&s;erved from the action of &s;trong &s;timulants, and every thing which produces an unnatural heat of the body &s;hould be avoid|ed: the&s;e precautions &s;hould be minutely attended to, not
<PB N="21" REF="22">only in ca&s;es of Indige&s;tion, but al&s;o in nervous di&s;ea&s;es, debi|lity, the gout, &amp;c. and even in perfect health.</P>
<P>SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.&mdash;If neither Malt Liquors nor Wine agree with the &s;tomach, a little Brandy, Rum, or Ge|neva, properly diluted with water, as they retard fermenta|tion and tend to prevent acidity, may prove a beneficial drink. But the too liberal u&s;e of Spirituous Liquors accu&s;toms the &s;tomach to an unnatural &s;timulus, which increa&s;es its action and de&s;troys its proper tone; produces &s;ickne&s;s and retching, a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, lo&s;s of memory, confu&s;ion of ideas, and nervous tremors: in hot climates, they occa&s;ion phrenzy&mdash;in cold ones, &s;tupidity. A man may appear very &s;ober, and yet drink a large quantity of the&s;e liquors &s;o as greatly to quicken the pul&s;e, and to excite an unnatural heat; which is hurtful to every body, particularly to a &s;edentary or &s;tudious man.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t extraordinary effects produced by the immoderate u&s;e of Spirits, is the following ca&s;e, communicated to the Royal Society by Mr. WILMER:&mdash;A woman, who had every day for many months, drank a great quantity of &s;piritu|ous liquors, was di&s;covered burnt to death at Coventry, though the fire in the grate had been &s;mall, and the furniture of the room had &s;uffered but little; the greate&s;t part of her body was con&s;umed, and even the bones were completely calcined. &mdash;An Italian Counte&s;s is &s;aid to have met with a &s;imilar &s;ate in con&s;equence of drinking immoderately of brandy.</P>
<P>WATER. This is not only a proper drink when acidity and flatulency prevail, but al&s;o where the bile has acquired too much acrimony. Cold water &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, prevents ob&s;tructions, renders &s;leep more calm, and cheerfulne&s;s more regular and la&s;ting: It has been ob|&s;erved, that water drinkers have their under&s;tandings more clear, their memory more &s;teady, their &s;en&s;es more quick, and their manners more gentle.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="23">
<P>Water is the drink Nature has given to all nations, made it agreeable to all palates, and is the only liquor to &s;atisfy thir&s;t of all the brute creation, and &s;ome part of mankind during their whole lives take no other; and the &s;tate of health tho&s;e per&s;ons enjoy, the hard labour and fatigue they are able to undergo, &s;hew that water is well &s;uited as a drink to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of the animal economy.

<P>Re&s;pecting the&s;e the following mode may be adopted as a good one; namely, that of allowing eight hours for labour or exerci&s;e, eight hours for plea&s;ure or amu&s;ement, and the &s;ame length of time for &s;leep or re&s;t; though &s;ome people require more of the latter. The patient &s;hould pay great attention to natural re&s;t, for by the want of this, the tone of the nervous &s;y&s;tem is greatly dimini&s;hed, and a weak circulation produced: hence palene&s;s, languor, colde&s;s, and dejection of &s;pirits.

<HEAD>AIR.</HEAD>
<P>The Patient &s;hould re&s;ide in a pure dry atmo&s;phere, becau&s;e pure air increa&s;es the ela&s;ticity of the mu&s;cular fibres, braces and invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;upports the vitality of the blood, and greatly contributes to the re&s;toration and pre&s;ervation of that principle in the animal economy called Irritability, on which health wholly depends: hence it facilitates the cure, not only of Indige&s;tion, but al&s;o of nervous di&s;ea&s;es and general relaxation. If the air, which is either one of the mo&s;t &s;alutary or pernicious agents, be moi&s;t, or contaminated with noxious effluvia, it will render the con&s;titution unhealthy, and al&s;o con&s;iderably impede the good effects of the remedy, let it be ever &s;o powerful.</P>
<P>Foul air is peculiarly inimical to the nervous &s;y&s;tem; it relaxes and enfeebles the general habit; and often produces di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs.

A few years ago, a remarkable in&s;tance occurred, which &s;hews the dangerous effects of foul &s;tagnant air: Eighteen children and a &s;ervant &s;lept in one apartment, in King-&s;treet, Golden-&s;quare; to render the room warmer, they &s;hut up the chim|ney, and u&s;ed every other expedient to exclude the cold air: the con&s;equences of which were, that the &s;ervant and ten of the children were &s;eized with excruciating pains in the pit of the &s;tomach and back, violent head ach, delirium, and con|vul&s;ions.</P>
<P>A very general error prevails among mankind, in expo&s;ing the body too much to the action of heat, with a view to pre|&s;erve it from the pernicious effects of cold. The influence of the latter will be the lea&s;t con&s;iderable on tho&s;e per&s;ons who are mo&s;t frequently but prudently expo&s;ed to its action. Tho&s;e who keep them&s;elves and their children con&s;tantly in a warm room, become greatly relaxed, and are &s;eldom without a cold or cough, from which mo&s;t of the con&s;umptions in this country originate; for if, in addition to the general debility ari&s;ing from &s;uch neglect of air and exerci&s;e, we con&s;ider the effects of the medicines u&s;ually pre&s;cribed to cure the cough, (which, being generally compo&s;ed of &s;yrups and oils, mu&s;t, it long continued, relax the &s;tomach and pall the appetite) we need not wonder, if, in&s;tead of the cold being removed, an incura|ble con&s;umption is induced. This ob&s;ervation applies al&s;o to &s;tudious men, who live a &s;edentary life, in an atmo&s;phere which, being &s;eldom renewed, is inela&s;tic, and full of noxious vapours: by this they are relaxed, and rendered heavy and low &s;pirited; and the bad effects ari&s;ing from &s;tudy and want of exerci&s;e, are greatly increa&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>SEA, OR COLD BATHING.</HEAD>
<P>Bathing being one of the principal remedies for indige&s;tion general debility, and nervous di&s;ea&s;es, I &s;hall here make a few ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting its u&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing affords more &s;trength to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, or produces a greater ela&s;ticity of the mu&s;cles and ve&s;&s;els, than &s;ea or cold bathing; it accelerates the motion of the blood, and promotes the different &s;ecretions: for though the water only acts immediately on the cutaneous nerves and blood ve&s;&s;els, yet, its benign influence, by &s;ympathy, is communicated to every part of the machine. But this, as well as all other grand remedies when improperly applied, will frequently produce the mo&s;t baneful effects; it will radicate more deeply in the habit tho&s;e complaints which it was intended to cure, and render them for ever incurable.</P>
<P>Indeed, on reflection, this is not to be wondered at; for mo&s;t per&s;ons imagine them&s;elves qualified to judge, and boldly venture their opinion, of the propriety of Bathing, who have not the &s;malle&s;t acquaintance with anatomy, phy&s;iology, the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es, the &s;cience of medicine, or philo&s;ophy in general; and who, con&s;equently, are incapable of di&s;crimi|nating in re&s;pect to the di&s;ea&s;e, or the con&s;titution of the patient; and certain it is, that no remedy whatever, can require a more accurate knowledge of the&s;e, than Bathing.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e con&s;iderations therefore, the following remarks are offered to the public, in order to obviate tho&s;e pernicious effects, which too frequently ari&s;e from an indi&s;criminate u&s;e of Bathing.</P>
<P>Previous to laying down particular rules, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e the two following general ones; that people may be able to form a judgment whether bathing is likely to be u&s;eful, or to prove injurious to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Where the patient, on coming out of the Bath, feels an univer&s;al plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of glowing warmth, the
<PB N="27" REF="28">ela&s;ticity of the mu&s;cular &s;ibres &s;eems increa&s;ed; and the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem &s;trengthened, and as it were, re-animated; the&s;e are proofs that it agrees perfectly well with the con&s;titution; and, if properly continued, will be of infinite &s;ervice: becau&s;e it thereby evidently appears, that the re-action of the heart and arteries is increa&s;ed, and con&s;equently, an equal di&s;tribution of the blood and other fluids to every minute ve&s;&s;el, is produced.</P>
<P>Second, But, on the contrary, where on coming out of the Bath, the patient feels a &s;en&s;ation of cold, attended with &s;hiver|ing, depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, pain in the head, or in any other part of the body, univer&s;al la&s;&s;itude or wearine&s;s, as though ju&s;t come from hard labour; the&s;e are &s;igns that bathing does not agree with the con&s;titution; becau&s;e they evidently &s;hew, that there is &s;uch a defect of irritability in the habit, that the heart and arteries are unable to overcome that con&s;triction of the cutane|ous ve&s;&s;els, which is the primary effect always produced by the application of cold to the &s;urface of the body.</P>
<P>The&s;e two general rules &s;hould be particulary attended to; for by an accurate ob&s;ervance thereof, either a great deal of good may be done by bathing, or much mi&s;chief prevented.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CASES IN WHICH BATHING WILL BE BENEFICIAL,</HEAD>
<P>Whenever there are &s;ymptoms of univer&s;al debility, ari&s;ing from inanition, or want of due nouri&s;hment, &s;uch as loo&s;e or flabby mu&s;cles, wearine&s;s or languor over the whole body, a &s;en&s;e of fatigue, upon the &s;lighte&s;t exertion of the mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem&punc; and an inclination to &s;weat upon very little exerci&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In all nervous di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y where there is an increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility, as faintings, tremblings, depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, alarm on every trifling occa&s;ion, nervous head-ach, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The cold or &s;ea bathing &s;hould be u&s;ed in general, in the morning before any food has been taken; though, at the &s;ame time it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome con&s;titutions cannot bear it previous to a light breakfa&s;t; with &s;uch it &s;hould
<PB N="28" REF="29">be u&s;ed between break&s;a&s;t and dinner, but not &s;o &s;oon after the fir&s;t meal as to interfere with dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>The frequency of bathing, and the time of continuing in the water, can only be determined by the nature of the complaint, and the &s;trength of the patient. It &s;hould not be u&s;ed oftener than three or four times a week, by per&s;ons of a &s;pare and na|turally delicate habit; and the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould only make a &s;ingle immer&s;ion, and come out immediately. Tho&s;e of greater &s;trength may u&s;e the bath more freely.</P>
<P>The be&s;t time for bathing, in general, is to commence about the middle of April, or beginning of May, according to the tem|perature of the &s;ea&s;on, and to continue it no longer than a month, or &s;ix weeks at mo&s;t; omitting it totally during the very &s;ultry months of &s;ummer; but it &s;hould never be employed later in the &s;ea&s;on than the beginning of November. By thus allowing an interval between the bathings, a &s;alutary change may be in|duced in the &s;olids and fluids; whereas, had it been per&s;i&s;ted in many months without intermi&s;&s;ion, it would not only have lo&s;t its tonic power, but debilitating effects might have been pro|duced. I have frequently ob&s;erved that the good effects of other tonic remedies as well as the cold bath are not always to be perceived during their u&s;e; for after taking them regularly about three weeks or a month with little or no apparent benefit; yet, en di&s;continuing them, I have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the very rapid manner in which the patient has recovered his health; which &s;erves to prove that &s;trengthening remedies extend their effects much beyond the time during which they are employed.</P>
<P>A day or two previous to bathing, a proper do&s;e of the Tonic Powders &s;hould be taken, (two papers will generally be &s;ufficient,) &s;o as to procure two or three motions, in order to evacuate the crudities of the bowels; which would, if allowed to remain there, prevent the bathing having the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, during the u&s;e of bathing, particular attention &s;hould be paid to the &s;tate of the &s;tomach and bowels, e&s;pecially
<PB N="29" REF="30">in tho&s;e per&s;ons who are troubled with a &s;uperfluous quantity of bile; for, if this is neglected, many bad con&s;equences may en&s;ue; as a conge&s;tion in the abdominal vi&s;cera, fevers, violent pain in the head, and even apoplexy may be produced. For this pur|po&s;e, I recommend the Tonic Powders, becau&s;e they operate without producing any unea&s;ine&s;s, either in the alimentary canal, or the &s;y&s;tem in general, and do not, like mo&s;t purgatives, as I have before noticed, induce a con&s;tipation of the bowels, or languid &s;tate of the body, after their operation; but by their tonic quality, they tend to &s;trengthen the dige&s;tive organs, and con&s;equently the whole habit, thereby favouring the intention with which the bath is employed.</P>
<P>Immediately on coming out of the bath, the body &s;hould be wiped perfectly dry as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;this promotes the circulation to the &s;urface, and thereby a&s;&s;i&s;ts in regulating the &s;ecretions, upon which mo&s;t of the good effects of bathing depend.</P>
<P>The &s;ea bath is found more efficacious than the cold bath, owing to the water being impregnated with &s;alt, which &s;timu|lates the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, and cau&s;es an increa&s;ed determina|tion of the fluids to the &s;urface of the body. Upon this princi|ple, I frequently order a quantity of &s;alt to be added to the water in which the patient is to bathe at home, with very good effect. It has been computed that every gallon of &s;ea water contains five ounces and a half of &s;alt; this therefore is the pro|portion which the &s;alt &s;hould bear to the water, in which the patient is to bathe. The water and &s;alt &s;hould be renewed every other, or third day.</P>
<P>I have frequently known the beneficial effects of bathing greatly promoted, e&s;pecially in weakly, nervous habits, by tak|ing two tea-&s;poonfuls of the Tonic Drops, in a gla&s;s of water, as &s;oon as the patient comes out of the bath; and, in the cour&s;e of my practice, I have often ob&s;erved, that univer&s;al, plea&s;ant, glowing &s;en&s;ations, &amp;c. take place, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this
<PB N="30" REF="31">medicine, where, without its &s;alutary influence, bathing would have been prejudicial.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed the particular ca&s;es, in which Sea or Cold Bathing will be found of the utmo&s;t benefit; I &s;hall now point out tho&s;e particular &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem in which its u&s;e would be very injurious.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, When the patient labours under any actual di&s;ea&s;e, or ob&s;truction of any of the vi&s;cera, either of the abdomen or thorax &mdash;Hence bathing is extremely improper in Con&s;umption of the Lungs, A&s;thma, Jaundice, or in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the liver, kidnies, bladder, or womb<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;een many dreadful effects produced by bathing, when the womb was di&s;ea&s;ed&mdash;About two years ago, I attend|ed a lady with an eminent &s;urgeon, for a complaint of that part; of which &s;he was cured, apparently, in two months, except &s;ometimes a &s;mall degree of pain. The following &s;um|mer &s;he con&s;ulted me about the air on the &s;ea coa&s;t and bathing. I advi&s;ed her to go to Margate, for the benefit of the air during the &s;ea&s;on, but in the &s;tronge&s;t terms di&s;&s;uaded her from bath|ing. However, not being &s;atisfied wi&s;h my opinion, as it did not accord with her own, &s;he con&s;ulted an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">her gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">leman, who was unacquainted with her complaint by who&s;e advice &s;he bathed in the &s;ea, which cau&s;ed a return of the complaint with great violence, and of which &s;he &s;oon died.</NOTE>: becau&s;e, by the gravity and cold|ne&s;s of the water, the blood and other fluids are driven from the extremities and &s;urface of the body towards the internal parts, and occa&s;ion an increa&s;e of the diameter of the ve&s;&s;els, which, being already in a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, are unable to bear &s;o great and &s;udden a determination; and, owing to the re&s;i&s;tanse they are compelled to make by a certain law of the animal oeconomy, an inflammation or rupture of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els may en&s;ue, or at lea&s;t, the exi&s;ting di&s;order may be greatly aggravated. This ob&s;ervation holds good with re&s;pect to the effects of the atmo&s;|phere, in winter and &s;pring; for, by rea&s;on of its coldne&s;s and pre&s;&s;ure, inflammatory complaints are more frequent at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons than in &s;ummer; and al&s;o con&s;umptive and a&s;thmatic di&s;orders are rendered more violent by the &s;ame means.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<P N="2">2dly, While the body is in a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ive &s;tate &mdash; Becau&s;e bathing, by con&s;tringing the cutaneous pores, throws back the fluids upon the bowels, thereby increa&s;ing the di&s;tention already &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting there and in the neighbouring parts, and, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t inevitably debilitate, in&s;tead of &s;trengthen the dige&s;tive organs: even &s;ometimes apoplexy, and many other complaints of the head may be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, When there is an intermitting, remitting, or hectic fever, or during the pre&s;ence of any periodical di&s;ea&s;e what&s;oever. Becau&s;e the &s;udden and great change, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">oduced by the coldne&s;s of the water, aggravates the&s;e complaints. It has been &s;aid, that the ague has been perfectly cured by plunging into the cold bath at the commencement of the fit; but this is by no means a &s;afe experiment, for if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould not be cured by it, the violence thereof will be greatly aggravated.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, When there is an increa&s;ed determination of blood to the head or brea&s;t&mdash;Hence people &s;hould be very cautious of bathing, who are di&s;po&s;ed to Inflammation of the Lungs, Con|&s;umption, or Head-ach, or &s;ubject to a Cough; becau&s;e the cold or &s;ea bath, by its principal and natural effect of repelling the blood to the internal parts, mu&s;t increa&s;e the conge&s;tion already pre&s;ent, and accelerate the coming on of the di&s;ea&s;e. This is not the only evil that may be induced, for apoplexy, Inflamma|tion of the Membranes of the Brain, or, what is yet more dread|ful, In&s;anity, may be occa&s;ioned; which, I have good rea&s;on to believe, has more frequently taken place from this cau&s;e, than is generally known or imagined.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, While there is an increa&s;ed or preternatural heat of the body&mdash;Becau&s;e by the &s;udden check given to the circulation, the Vis-medicatrix-naturae may be excited to &s;uch a degree, as to produce a Fever or local Inflammation.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, While there is a diminution of heat, or &s;en&s;ation of cold pre&s;ent&mdash;Becau&s;e the con&s;triction of the extreme ve&s;&s;els, already taken place, would be &s;o increa&s;ed by the immer&s;ion,

In&s;tances daily occur, where inflammations, boils, ab|&s;ce&s;&s;es, and ulcerations, of the external parts, very difficult to heal, are, in that particular &s;tate of the con&s;titution above &s;peci|fied occa&s;ioned by bathing: for, although there may be evident &s;igns of univer&s;al debility, which &s;eem to indicate the propriety of bathing, yet it &s;hould be remembered, that this debility may ari&s;e from general di&s;tention, and not from want of nutrition.&mdash; The&s;e two &s;pecies of debility require quite oppo&s;ite remedies; therefore they &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other with the utmo&s;t accuracy, previous to bathing; by which means much mi&s;chief may be prevented.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of Cold of Sea Bathing in this la&s;t ca&s;e, the u&s;e of the Tonic Powders will be of infinite &s;ervice, owing to their com|bining an evacuant power with their tonic quality. They &s;hould be taken &s;o as to procure three or four motions daily, and &s;hould be per&s;i&s;ted in for ten or twelve days, or while any unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation remains</P>
<P N="8">8thly, During the pre&s;ence of the Haemorrhoids, or Piles&mdash; Becau&s;e the Cold Bath will, mo&s;t probably, repel the blood &s;uddenly from the haemorrhoidal veins, where nature had de|po&s;ited it, in order to relieve the general habit; &s;o that, by the interruption given to her &s;alutary operations, a determination to the head and lungs may en&s;ue, and in con&s;equence many di&s;orders of tho&s;e parts, as well as a train of di&s;ea&s;es, may ari&s;e. I have known many in&s;tances where people have died of in|flammation of the lungs, ari&s;ing from the application of cold,
<PB N="33" REF="34">by &s;itting upon damp ground at that particular time, or by putting on a pair of &s;mall clothes not properly aired.</P>
<P N="9">9th, While any natural periodical di&s;charge continues &mdash; Be|cau&s;e, many complaints of the mo&s;t malignant nature may be produced. This ob&s;ervation &s;hould be particularly attended to by women, whom it more immediately concerns.</P>
<P N="10">10th, Bathing &s;hould not be made u&s;e of very &s;oon after mebriation, or any other irregularity; becau&s;e the body would be too weak to bear the &s;hock.</P>
<P N="11">11th, It &s;hould not be u&s;ed, but with the utmo&s;t caution, during the whole period of ge&s;tation, or pregnancy &mdash; Becau&s;e during that time, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t months, the patient is &s;eldom able to bear &s;o &s;udden a &s;hock to the &s;y&s;tem in general, or &s;o great a determination to the womb in particular; there|fore abortion, as well as great mi&s;chief to the con&s;titution, may be expected from the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of bathing under that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P N="12">12th, Women in general &s;hould never bathe, but upon the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and then not without proper advice &mdash; Becau&s;e very few of them can bear &s;o &s;udden or &s;o great a &s;hock, owing to the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of their nerves, and the irri|tability of their general &s;y&s;tem, which exceeds tho&s;e of men. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds good with regard to children; many of whom I have known thrown into convul&s;ions, as well as women into hy&s;teric fits, by the very &s;udden and violent &s;hock given to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, by immer&s;ion in cold water.</P>
<P>I am much again&s;t accu&s;toming children to the cold bath, as the ingenious Dr. Buchan advi&s;es in his Dome&s;tic Medicine, at a very early age, (unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;olutely requires it), or continuing it too long. I have, for my own part, no notion of endeavouring to prevent complaints, which, in all probability, would never happen unle&s;s &s;ome or all of the occa&s;ional cau&s;es on which mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of children depend, were applied: &s;uch as, food in too great a quantity, or of a pernicious
<PB N="34" REF="35">quality, want of due exerci&s;e, or cleanline&s;s, and &s;ometimes confined air, By removing the&s;e cau&s;es, or, what is &s;till better, never applying them&punc; we &s;hould, in ninety-nine ca&s;es out of a hundred, find the cold bath, as well as all other remedies, unnece&s;&s;ary. At the &s;ame time I wi&s;h it to be under&s;tood, that I have a very high opinion of cold bathing, when there is a real indication for its u&s;e; but, on the other hand, I think it ex|tremely cruel, to be teazing a child with a pretended remedy, while it is in perfect health. I have more exalted ideas of the great Author of Nature, than for one moment to imagine, that it is in the power of any remedy to render the con&s;titution more perfect than it was intended by him.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>"For health, on exerci&s;e and food depend;</L>
<L>"God never made his works for man to mend."</L></Q>
<P>Cold Bathing is likewi&s;e improper at or near the time when a return of the gout is expected: for a little before the recur|rence of this di&s;ea&s;e, irregular determinations generally take place; &s;ometimes to the head, affecting it with pain and giddi|ne&s;s; &s;ometimes to the lungs, producing a difficulty of breathing; and &s;ometimes to the &s;tomach and bowels, cau&s;ing &s;ickne&s;s and pain. Bathing, at this time, would encourage the&s;e determi|nations, and prevent the gout from fixing in its proper feat, the extremities; in con&s;equence of which, violent inflammations and the mo&s;t fatal effects may follow.</P>
<P>It &s;hould al&s;o be u&s;ed with great circum&s;pection after the gout is gone off&mdash;becau&s;e, in general, the body is too much debilitated by that di&s;ea&s;e, to be able to bear the violence of the &s;hock. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, bathing is improper in all ca&s;es of extreme debility, from whatever cau&s;e it may ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Cold or &s;ea bathing cannot be &s;afely employed during the action of any irritating cau&s;e in the &s;y&s;tem&mdash;Becau&s;e that irri|tation would be much increa&s;ed by the &s;trong re-action of the heart and arteries, which is one of the &s;econdary effects of bathing. Hence it is improper in glandular ob&s;tructions, when
<PB N="35" REF="36">they have arrived to a certain pitch. It can only be u&s;ed with advantage in an incipient &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, and even then &s;hould be employed with great caution.</P>
<P>The Sea Air and Exerci&s;e contribute greatly to the good effects of bathing, and very frequently prove extremely bene|ficial to tho&s;e per&s;ons, in who&s;e ca&s;es bathing, according to the foregoing rules, is &s;trictly prohibited. In my opinion, the re|covery of the patient has been often attributed to bathing, when in reality, it was merely owing to the following circum&s;tances:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. The Purity and Coolne&s;s of the Sea Air:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. The Mind being totally di&s;engaged from Anxiety and Bu&s;ine&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. The Amu&s;ements and Company of the Place, joined with Exerci&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Sea Air is rendered by the water,&mdash;Fir&s;t, More pure: Second, More cool.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, by the &s;ea water ab&s;orbing tho&s;e impurities, or noxious particles, with which the air in large towns and cities is replete. For which rea&s;on, it mu&s;t be better adapted to the purpo&s;es of re&s;piration; as the oxygen, or ba&s;is of vital air, thereby becomes increa&s;ed in proportion; by which means, the blood is more fully impregnated with the vital principle.</P>
<P>Second, The air is rendered more cook, by its pa&s;&s;ing over &s;o large a tract of water. Hence, near the &s;ea, are felt none of tho&s;e unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations which ari&s;e from the heat of the air in &s;ummer, in large cities or inland places; but a con&s;tant cool|ing, refre&s;hing breeze is perceived, &s;o congenial to the feelings, and &s;o advantageous to the health of man; which moderates the exce&s;s of heat, prevents its irritating and debilitating effects, and produces the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences.</P>

The&s;e I have u&s;ed, with many others, but never yet found a medicine that will act with &s;o much certainty and &s;afety, as the Tonic Powders; be|cau&s;e, as ob&s;erved before, they may be taken by per&s;ons of any age, &s;ex, or under every circum&s;tance of the con&s;titution; as they do not, like other opening medicines, excite an unnatural &s;timulus of the &s;tomach and bowels, in order to produce their effect; nor does their operation, which is both mild and effec|tual, interfere with the occupations of life.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar co&s;tivene&s;s, affecting &s;tudious people, and tho&s;e advanced in years, which very frequently cau&s;es inflam|mation in the bowels, often terminating fatally in the cour&s;e of a few days: &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould never be without the Tonic Powers, but &s;hould take them occa&s;ionally as circum&s;tances may require. I have every rea&s;on to believe, that with the&s;e pow|ders I have pre&s;erved the health of hundreds; as they are &s;o benign in their effects, that they have invariably improved the con&s;titution of tho&s;e who have taken them.</P>
<P>The&s;e powders are widely different in their effects from Ander&s;on's, commonly called Scotch Pills, which are injurious to the con&s;titution in the following re&s;pects:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t, Ander&s;on's Pills, after their purgative operation is over, leave a con&s;tipated &s;tate of the bowels.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly, They heat the body, therefore cannot be employed, with propriety, in every con&s;titution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly, They &s;timulate the rectum, or lower bowel, thereby producing the Piles,&mdash;a highly di&s;agreeable and painful di&s;order, which often terminates in fi&s;tula.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4thly, They have a peculiar effect in making women unwell at an improper time, owing to their &s;timulating the part men|tioned
<PB N="37" REF="38">before, and are not only un&s;afe, but extremely danger|ous, during pregnancy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5thly. Aloes, of which the&s;e pills are compo&s;ed, is of &s;uch a nature, that, when the bowels become habituated to its u&s;e, they will not act properly without it; therefore, when once become a cu&s;tom, it mu&s;t generally be continued through life.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>On the contrary, the Tonic Powders have quite different effects:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. They induce a natural &s;tate of the bowels, after they have operated as a purgative.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly, In&s;tead of heating the body, they abate irritation, and render the patient cool and comfortable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly, In&s;tead of producing the Piles, they prevent or cure them, as numbers have experienced, who have taken them by my direction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4thly, I have had repeated opportunities of proving the good effects of the&s;e powers in pregnancy, wherein they alleviate, or prevent, all the uncomfortable &s;ymptoms, (e&s;peci|ally the &s;ickne&s;s and retching,) which occur during that parti|cular period, with the utmo&s;t &s;afety.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5thly, The Tonic Powders have quite a contrary tendency to the aloes; they not only produce a natural action of the bowels after being taken a little time, but may be left off without the lea&s;t inconvenience.</ITEM>

<HEAD>NERVOUS DISORDERS.</HEAD>
<P>Whenever the patient has been troubled with faintings, depre&s;&s;ions of &s;pirits, alternate &s;hiverings and flu&s;hing heats, the Tonic Powders and Drops have cured great numbers of people, after various other methods had proved ineffectual.</P>
<P>The following Rules &s;hould be attended to, during the cure of nervous di&s;ea&s;es:</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of Indige&s;tion mu&s;t be avoided.</P>
<P>The quantity and quality of the food &s;hould be regarded: more mu&s;t never be eaten, than will fit perfectly ea&s;y on the &s;tomach; and that quality mu&s;t be avoided, which is known to di&s;agree. Spoon diet &s;hould be taken &s;paringly, becau&s;e it weakens more than &s;trengthens the body: in &s;hort, the &s;olid food &s;hould be increa&s;ed, and the fluid aliment dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Animal food &s;hould bear a greater proportion than Vege|table, e&s;pecially in winter; particularly in tho&s;e per&s;ons who are troubled with wind or acidity in the &s;tomach. Roa&s;t meat is preferable to boiled.</P>
<P>The drink mu&s;t not be heating or &s;timulating to the &s;to|mach: &mdash;I have known &s;everal people prevent the return of nervous complaints by taking no other drink than water. Drams mu&s;t be avoided; for; though they may rai&s;e the &s;pirits, and give pre&s;ent ea&s;e to a di&s;ordered &s;tomach, yet they will ulti|mately increa&s;e the complaint.</P>
<P>The &s;leep and re&s;t &s;hould be at lea&s;t eight hours out of the twenty-four, &s;ometimes nine will be requi&s;ite; for tho&s;e afflicted with the&s;e complaints, require a great deal of re&s;t, and &s;ome people hurt them&s;elves by a contrary practice.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="41">
<P>Exerci&s;e mu&s;t be regularly u&s;ed, but not a very fatiguing degree. The &s;tomach and bowels &s;hould be well rubbed, every night and morning, with the fle&s;h bru&s;h or flannel; which will prove of great &s;ervice to &s;uch per&s;ons as are afflicted with nervous complaints or wind in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The mind &s;hould be kept &s;erene and tranquil, and &s;tudy and di&s;putes, upon every con&s;ideration, avoided.</P>
<P>A comfortable warmth ought always to be pre&s;erved, but much heat &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>Moi&s;t, contaminated, or confined air, produces debility and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, therefore it &s;hould be exchanged for a dry and pure atmo&s;phere: hence the propriety of the country air, or that on the &s;ea coa&s;t. Tho&s;e nervous per&s;ons, therefore, who are obliged to live always in London, or in clo&s;e towns, &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible re&s;ide, for one or two months in the &s;ummer, on the &s;ea coa&s;t, which will increa&s;e the vitality of the blood, brace the relaxed nerves, and give tone to the mu&s;cular fibres.</P>
<P>The &s;ea or cold bath &s;hould be u&s;ed, though with great judg|ment and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why a remedy for nervous complaints has not been more frequently obtained, is becau&s;e the patient becomes un&s;teady, owing to the length of time nece&s;&s;ary to complete a cure, and runs from one phy&s;ician to another till at la&s;t he becomes di&s;&s;atisfied, and lo&s;es confidence in every medicine, though it may be calculated upon the be&s;t principle for curing the complaint.</P>

<HEAD>GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall give the hi&s;tory of this di&s;ea&s;e exactly as it has oc|curred in my practice.</P>
<P>It is di&s;tingui&s;hed into the Regular and Irregular Gout.</P>
<P>Though the Regular Gout &s;ometimes &s;eizes &s;uddenly, with|out any &s;igns of its approach, when &s;eemingly the patient is in the mo&s;t perfect health; yet the fit is often preceded by &s;ome of the following &s;ymptoms: Lo&s;s of appetite, acidity, flatulency, unea&s;ine&s;s and fulne&s;s of the &s;tomach, general languor, various nervous &s;ymptoms, and a &s;en&s;ation as if cold water was trickling down the thighs; &s;ometimes a keen appetite takes place the day before the fit.</P>
<P>The patient, at the commencement of the Regular Gout, is waked about midnight, or one or two in the morning, with a very violent pain of the foot, generally in the great toe, but &s;ometime in the ancle, often attended with chilline&s;s and &s;hivering, which are &s;ucceeded by &s;ome degree of fever. The pain increa&s;es every hour, and comes to its height towards evening, which becomes &s;o exqui&s;ite that the patient is &s;carce able to endure the weight of the bed clothes, nor the &s;haking of the room from a per&s;on's walking acro&s;s it; and hence the night is not only pa&s;&s;ed in pain, but likewi&s;e with a re&s;tle&s;s removal of the part affected from one place to another and a continual change of its po&s;ture. The pain commonly remits in about twenty-four hours from the fir&s;t approach of
<PB N="42" REF="43">the fit, and then the patient falls a&s;leep, and a gentle moi&s;ture comes over the whole body, as well as on the pained part, which then appears &s;welled and red,&mdash;In general the pain abates when the part &s;wells. The patient continues ea&s;ier through the day; the pain, with &s;ome degree of fever, increa&s;es towards evening, and after a re&s;tle&s;s night, they both remit in the morning with a gentle &s;weat. The pain after being for &s;ometime fixt in one place, &s;hifts to another, and in this way vi&s;its mo&s;t parts of the foot, and in a few days removes to the other foot, and affects it in the &s;ame manner.&mdash;The urine is high coloured, and not in the u&s;ual quantity; but in the decline of the fit, it becomes copi|ous, with a large &s;ediment;&mdash;during the fit there is u&s;ually an uncommon flow of &s;pirits, and clearne&s;s of under&s;tanding &mdash; When the fit is going off, the parts affected become violently itchy, e&s;pecially between the toes, the cuticle falls off and a lamene&s;s is left proportioned to the &s;everity and length of the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;The duration of the &s;it is uncertain; but in general when the pain is mo&s;t violent, it is of the &s;horte&s;t continuance, and the interval between the fits is longe&s;t.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed the regular Gout, I &s;hall now mention tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which con&s;titute the irregular or flying-gout.&mdash; The irregular &s;eizes the hands, wri&s;ts, elbows, knees, and other parts, as &s;everely as the regular gout did the &s;eet. It often affects the &s;tomach with very violent pain, &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;tention, and wind, the bowels with griping and fulne&s;s, the head with pain and giddine&s;s, the lungs with difficulty of breathing, and the kidnies with pain of the back, all of which alternate with pain and &s;wellings of the joints &mdash;It frequently produces di&s;orders of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, con&s;equently the mind becomes affected, which &s;ympathi&s;es with the body, &s;o that it is not ea&s;y to deter|mine which of the two is mo&s;t affected.&mdash;In feeble or broken con&s;titutions, or when the di&s;ea&s;e has been of long duration, the fits become le&s;s &s;evere, but continue longer, and the di&s;ea&s;e becomes more moveable.&mdash;After a regular fit of the gout, the
<PB N="43" REF="44">patient enjoys perfect health, which is not the ca&s;e after an irregular fit.</P>
<P>When the gout has continued long, it often produces chalky concretions, weakne&s;s, rigidity or &s;tiffne&s;s of the joints, and &s;ometimes ab&s;olute lamene&s;s.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is not dangerous while confined to the extremi|ties, but often proves fatal when it &s;hifts from them, and falls upon any of the internal parts, or where from a deficiency of vigour of the con&s;titution, it cannot be propelled to its proper &s;eat the feet.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es which produce indige&s;tion, al&s;o occa&s;ion the gout.</P>
<P>Authors, in general, have certainly been greatly mi&s;taken with regard to the treatment of the Gout: &s;ome have pretended to cure it by regimen alone, declaring that patience, good nur&s;ing, and the application of flannel to the parts, were all that po&s;&s;ibly could be done during the fit: and that diet, air, and exerci&s;e, were only to be depended upon to prevent a return. This doctrine has much influenced our pre&s;ent trifling mode of practice, and has occa&s;ioned the ruin of many con&s;titutions; for, con&s;onant to this opinion, they have laid down rules re&s;pecting diet, quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e the patient had been accu&s;tomed to; and tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have adhered thereto, have &s;uffered more by intervening di&s;ea&s;es, than they would have done, had they per&s;i&s;ted in their u&s;ual mode of high living; for &s;udden changes, in that re&s;pect, in the intervals, are always attended with &s;ome degree of hazard, and when the con&s;titution is debilitated, with the utmo&s;t danger. Whenever a change therefore, in point of regimen is nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould be made gradually.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e authors again who have relied on medicines alone for a cure, have been nder as great an error as tho&s;e who have wholly depended on regimen: although Medicines may remove the pre&s;ent &s;ymptoms, yet, while the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e is acting, the effect mu&s;t again recur, and, in all probability with
<PB N="44" REF="45">redintegrated &s;trength, when the patient returns to his former habits.</P>
<P>In order to cure the Gout, on a true principle the following rules mu&s;t be &s;trictly adhered to:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t The action of the &s;tomach and bowels &s;hould be affi&s;ted, and the indige&s;tible matter, from time to time, gently evacuated downwards, which the&s;e organs are not able to do of them&s;elves, owing to the contractile power thereof being &s;o much dimi|ni&s;hed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. The tone of the dige&s;tive organs &s;hould be increa&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. The general and nervous &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be &s;trengthened.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e are to be accompli&s;hed by medicines, joined to the following rules re&s;pecting regimen:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. Proper diet, both in quantity and quality, &s;hould be adopted. Vegetables &s;hould be taken &s;paringly, in proportion to animal food, by tho&s;e per&s;ons who are troubled with wind and acidity in the &s;tomach.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Exerci&s;e, according to the &s;trength of the patient, &s;hould be regularly performed. Univer&s;al experience of this di&s;ea&s;e being unknown to labouring people, is &s;ufficient to prove that exerci&s;e is a good a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the prevention and cure of the gout.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Whole&s;ome air, and natural re&s;t, &s;hould be duly attended to.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. Cold or &s;ea bathing, &s;hould be judiciou&s;ly employed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5th. The cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e, mentioned under indige&s;tion, ought to be avoided.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Tonic Powders and Drops, are a &s;afe and efficacious remedy for the gout; and I can affirm, that, in my practice, which has been upwards of &s;ixteen years, during which time I have attended great numbers of gouty patients, they have always produced the following effects:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. They lengthen the interval between the fits&mdash;2dly, They &s;horten the duration of the fit, when pre&s;ent&mdash;3dly, They abate
<PB N="45" REF="46">the violence of the pain&mdash;4thly, They take off the inflamma|tory diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem, con&s;equently they tend to remove the topical inflammation. 5th, During the fit they prevent the u&s;ual debility taking place, and &s;trengthen the con&s;titution in the intervals.&mdash;6th. When the gout &s;eizes the &s;tomach, that organ becomes &s;o cold and torpid, that neither wine nor &s;pirits &s;eem &s;tronger than water, in this ca&s;e the Tonie Drops have mo&s;t admirable effects.</P>
<P>Though I do not pretend, with the&s;e medicines to perform impo&s;&s;ibilities, yet my experience of their effects induces me to believe, that by the u&s;e of the Tonic Powders and Drops, the Gout may be era&s;ed from the li&s;t of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which have hitherto obtained the appellation of <HI>opprobria medicina,</HI> or incurable.</P>
<P>Where the pain and inflammation of the feet are violent, I have experienced the good effects of the application of leeches, either on the inflamed part, or as near to it as po&s;&s;ible; the latter generally an&s;wers better than when applied immediately on the part it&s;elf. Dr. Dover &s;trongly recommends a thin beef &s;teak to be applied to the affected part, as a topical remedy for the gout; and Dr. Williams, who has written a very ingenious treati&s;e, has ordered it, with very extraordinary good effects, where the inflammation has not been too great, or the parts too much debilitated; it opens the pores, and di&s;charges the gouty matter &s;o plentifully by per&s;piration, that if it is not changed, at lea&s;t every two hours, it grows putrid and becomes offen&s;ive: in fact, it appears to have all the good effects of a warm cata|pla&s;m, without irritating the affected parts.</P>
<P>The affected parts &s;hould not be kept too warm: at the &s;ame time, a comfortable warmth &s;hould by all means be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The treatment re&s;pecting food and drink, during the fit, mu&s;t be &s;uited to the patient's age, con&s;titution, and the violence of the di&s;order; the accu&s;tomed mode of living &s;hould likewi&s;e be attended to; for example, if the patient is young, the con&s;titu|tion &s;trong, the general and local inflammation high, &s;olid ani|mal
<PB N="46" REF="47">food, fermented and other &s;trong liquors, mu&s;t be avoided: and a cooling farinacious diet and diluting drinks made u&s;e of. This will co-operate with the medicine, in le&s;&s;ening the violence, and &s;hortening the duration of the &s;it.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, if the patient be advanced in years, or the con&s;titution much debiliated; or if there be the lea&s;t apprehen|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the internal parts being affected by the di&s;ea&s;e, a more generous diet mu&s;t be adopted, with the liberal u&s;e of Madeira wine, &s;herry, &amp;c. Being very ab&s;temious, in this ca&s;e, would be highly dangerous to the patient.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent mode of treating the gout indi&s;criminately, with wine, hot cordials, and rich food, mu&s;t be reprobated by every judicious practitioner, as it tends to increa&s;e the inflammation already in the blood, to heighten the fever, and to render the fit more &s;evere as well as of longer duration, and at the &s;ame time &s;trengthens the popular opinion of the gout being incurable.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fit is over, means &s;hould be u&s;ed to brace and &s;trengthen the relaxed fibres, to give force to the weakened mu&s;cles, and to put the con&s;titution into a &s;tate, capable of re&s;i&s;ting the di&s;order for the future. For this purpo&s;e, the Tonic Powders and Drops I have found preferable to every other medicine, e&s;pecially when united to a proper regimen.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e &s;hould al&s;o be employed in the intervals of the Gout, together with the&s;e medicines, which, in conjunction with temperance, have been frequently known radically to cure the di&s;ea&s;e, even in ca&s;es where a &s;trong hereditary di&s;po&s;ition had previou&s;ly exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>During the intervals of the fit, the diet, air, and exerci&s;e &s;hould be the &s;ame as recommended under Indige&s;tion.</P>

<HEAD>DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>Before I enter upon the cure of the Drop&s;y, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to premi&s;e a few remarks, in order to &s;hew the manner in
<PB N="47" REF="48">which this di&s;ea&s;e is produced, and to point out the true princi|ple upon which the Tonic Powders and Drops act, in effecting the cure</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is primarily occa&s;ioned by indige&s;tion and debility; but ultimately it is produced&mdash;either, by the exhalent ve&s;&s;els pouring a &s;uperfluous quantity of watery fluid into the cavities of the body:&mdash;or, by the ab&s;orbents being rendered unable to take up the proper quantity of fluid, which &s;hould be re conveyed into the circulation:&mdash;and &s;ometimes, the Drop&s;y is the effect of both of the&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved before, in order to render this matter more per&s;picuous, that the peculiar u&s;e of the exhalents is to pour a fluid into every cavity of the &s;y&s;tem, de&s;igned by the great Author of nature, to lubricate the parts, in order to facilitate motion.&mdash;It is a well-known fact in philo&s;ophy, that the action and re-action of all &s;olid bodies, are much facilitated by an inter|vening fluid, without which, attrition would &s;oon de&s;troy that power of cohe&s;ion and attraction by which all bodies are held together, and con&s;equently motion would be totally impeded.</P>
<P>The office of the ab&s;orbents is to take up that portion of the fluid which remains after an&s;wering the purpo&s;e above mentioned, and to convey it into the general ma&s;s, in order to give room for a fre&s;h &s;upply.&mdash;Where the&s;e two &s;ets of ve&s;&s;els, viz. the exhalents and ab&s;orbents, do not act in equilibrium, a drop&s;y, partial or general, mu&s;t en&s;ue.</P>

<P>When they are contained in the inte&s;tines, they produce the following &s;ymptoms:&mdash;The belly is much di&s;tended, as though the patient was afflicted with a windy drop&s;y, with now and then a purging, but &s;ometimes a co&s;tivene&s;s is pre&s;ent, the upper parts wa&s;te away, in&s;omuch that the bones are vi&s;ible, and yet the appetite is great, the face is generally pale and tumid, and a cough, fever, and pleuritic pains are often produced.</P>
<P>The &s;mall, like book worms, called a&s;carides, are contained in the rectum or lower bowel, and are &s;ometimes thrown out in great quantities; they produce inflation of the belly, lean|ne&s;s, and nau&s;ea; they are attended with great itchings of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nus, and cau&s;e foetid excrements.&mdash;This kind of worm though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s difficult to cure as any, yet it is the lea&s;t dangerous of all.</P>

<HEAD>FEMALE COMPLAINTS.</HEAD>
<P>There are two critical periods in the life of females, in which the general habit undergoes a material change, namely the COMMENCEMENT and CESSATION.&mdash;The fir&s;t happens between the age of fourteen and &s;ixteen years; and the latter commonly from the age of forty-five to fifty. I &s;hall make a few remarks re&s;pecting the management nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved at both the&s;e particular times, as on this frequently depends a good or bad &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with that period which commences at the early part of life.</P>
<P>Indige&s;tion and general debility are the cau&s;es of this &s;alutary change not happening in due time; becau&s;e the juices derived from the food, being, crude and watery, are in&s;ufficient to &s;up|ply the body with due nouri&s;hment; hence the heart, which is the principal in&s;trument of circulation, can hardly drive forward the blood in its ve&s;&s;els, or di&s;tribute that vital fluid to the dif|ferent parts of the body; therefore its due offices cannot be ac|compli&s;hed: hence proceed ob&s;tructions, attended with &s;ickne&s;s flatulency, palpitation of the heart, head-ach, and a throbbing or tremulous motion of the internal parts, e&s;pecially after ex|erci&s;e, or &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e, heart-burn, and a &s;welling of the &s;tomach; the patient's appetite is whim&s;ical, and much im|paired, often directing her to things void of nouri&s;hment, and improper, &s;uch as chalk, cinders, &s;our raw fruits, and the like. The countenance is &s;ometimes wan and &s;allow, with a remarka|ble palene&s;s of the lips and gums, and exce&s;&s;ive coldne&s;s of the feet, wearine&s;s, depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, reluctance to exerci&s;e wandering pains and &s;low fever.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="52">
<P>In order to promote this &s;alutary alteration, the whole con|&s;titution mu&s;t be &s;trengthened, which will aid the powerful efforts of nature, a circum&s;tance of the utmo&s;t cen&s;equence to the patient's future welfare, though too generally di&s;regarded. Which can only be done by &s;uch medicines as are calculated to give &s;trength to the dige&s;tive organs, and tone to the general &s;y&s;tem, united to proper diet, moderate exerci&s;e, and natural re&s;t, which will inevitably empower the animal oeconomy to effect this grand office; by the &s;ame means the &s;ecretions will be promoted, and tho&s;e di&s;orders, which before had re&s;i&s;ted the mo&s;t powerful medicines, nature will be enabled to remedy her&s;elf: but, unle&s;s the debility be removed, it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble to remedy the&s;e complaints.</P>
<P>Whenever therefore this &s;alutary alteration does not take place in due time, or an accidental ob&s;truction has been pro|duced, I have pre&s;cribed the Tonic Powders and Drops, with the happie&s;t effect, even after the u&s;ual cour&s;e of medicines had been admini&s;tered without any benefit.</P>
<P>Parents and guardians, or tho&s;e intru&s;ted with the important office of &s;uperintending the health and education of young ladies, &s;hould direct their conduct with the utmo&s;t care and attention, at this critical juncture, for on the &s;ea&s;onable commencement, and regular returns of nature, depends their future health.&mdash;</P>
<P>The engagement of the mind, the degree of exerci&s;e, the quantity and quality of the food, together with the nature of the air they breathe, &s;hould be regarded with the mo&s;t prudent caution.</P>
<P>The quantity and quality of food &s;hould be &s;uited to the di|ge&s;tive power of the &s;tomach.&mdash;She &s;hould eat often, and in &s;mall quantities, of what is light and &s;imple, and thoroughly ma&s;ticate, or chew it, which is a circum&s;tance of much more con&s;equence to tho&s;e who have weak &s;tomachs than is generally imagined. The drink &s;hould be light and rather nouri&s;hing but not heating; no heat &s;hould be thrown into the habit but
<PB N="52" REF="53">what is obtained from exerci&s;e: this promotes the natural action of the heart and lungs, whereby a quantity of air will be taken into the blood, which will produce all the beneficial effects of a gentle &s;timulus, without preternaturally heating the &s;y&s;tem; &s;he &s;hould ab&s;tain from the immoderate u&s;e of watery fluids, coffee is more whole&s;ome than tea, drunk with the ad|dition of milk.</P>
<P>Moderate exerci&s;e, in the open air &s;hould be u&s;ed; this will at fir&s;t, fatigue the weak patient, and put her out of breath; but when &s;teadily per&s;i&s;ted in, &s;he will daily gain &s;trength and &s;pirits; &s;o that what was before a puni&s;hment, will afterwards become a plea&s;ing amu&s;ement; &s;he &s;hould walk, or ride in the air, an hour or two, every day before dinner, when the weather will admit.</P>
<P>The cold bath, where there is no decay of the lungs, or other internal parts, will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t the cure by bracing the &s;olids: but this, being a remedy of a powerful kind, ought never to be u&s;ed without proper advice, as many in&s;tances have occurred where &s;uch as laboured under con&s;umptive &s;ymptoms, with weak ulcerated lungs, &amp;c. have been de&s;troyed by its un|&s;ea&s;onable u&s;e.</P>
<P>Though forcing and heating medicines are pre&s;cribed indi&s;|criminately to every female at this time; and believed by mothers to be &s;pecifics and infallible; yet they are dangerous and unnatural, and have ruined the health of thou&s;ands; for they act either by &s;timulating the lower bowel, or heating the body, (in &s;ome, &s;uch as the aloes, both the&s;e effects are united,) which, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, tends to increa&s;e the cau&s;e from whence the complaint originated: nature, on the contrary, ac|compli&s;hes her de&s;igns by &s;low degrees, and con&s;equently with|out violence to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>For a fuller account of food, air, and exerci&s;e, &s;ee the remarks under Indige&s;tion: al&s;o for the u&s;e of the Cold Bath, &s;ee the ob&s;ervations on that head.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="54">
<P>I &s;hall now treat of tho&s;e complaints which happen between the commencement and ce&s;&s;ation of the&s;e two periods in which the Tonic Medicines will be of infinite &s;ervice. I have at|tended a great number of ladies, who, owing to their ill &s;tate of health, were either never pregnant at all, or el&s;e could never arrive at the full time. By &s;trengthening the whole con&s;titu|tion with the Tonic Medicines, joined to a proper diet and ex|erci&s;e, with a di&s;creet u&s;e of the cold bath, I have had the &s;atis|faction of recovering the health of my patients, and afterwards of delivering them of very fine, healthy children,</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e often occurs in practice, which is very difficult to remedy, if not attended to in proper time:&mdash; A woman, apparently of a healthy con&s;titution, is &s;eized with a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, ob&s;truction, or di&s;continuance. For many months, &s;ome women feel very little inconvenience under this circum&s;tance: while others &s;oon grow big, with ten|&s;ion and pain in the belly, and &s;ome enlargement of the brea&s;ts, &s;ickne&s;s in the mornings, di&s;like to particular foods, and other &s;ymptoms &s;imilar to pregnancy,&mdash;and married women believe them&s;elves in this &s;ituation, and imagine that they actually perceive the child, and are &s;ometimes not undeceived till the time of ge&s;tation is much exceeded.&mdash;The Tonic Powders and proper attention to diet will effectually remove the&s;e com|plaints.</P>
<P>Another ca&s;e has often occurred to me in practice: namely&mdash; A violent &s;pa&s;modic pain, apparently in the &s;tomach and bowels, takes places, in both married and &s;ingle women, previous to every time of their being unwell, and &s;ometimes during the whole time of their being &s;o: Nothing is more excruciating to the patient; it greatly impairs the health, and predi&s;po&s;es the body to dangerous di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;This is a mo&s;t &s;erious evil, and &s;hould be particularly attended to. By the following method, I have been happy enough to prevent a return:&mdash;The moment the pain is coming on, I always give
<PB N="54" REF="55">fifteen or twenty drops of Tincture of Opium, and (if needful) repeat it every four hours: it is &s;carcely ever nece&s;&s;ary to give more than two do&s;es, before it an&s;wers every wi&s;hed-for purpo&s;e. The patient &s;hould keep in, or upon the bed, at lea&s;t in a recumbent po&s;ture, and drink moderately of any diluting warm liquor, &s;uch as black tea, weak whey, thin broth, &amp;c. I have, in this ca&s;e al&s;o, pre&s;cribed the Tonic Powders, with the mo&s;t happy effect.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now treat of the management nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erv|ed at the CESSATION, or that particular period when Nature Is about to make that change in the con&s;titution, which gene|rally happens about the age of forty-five, or from thence to fifty. Some women, at this time, feel no material alteration in their health; others, after a total ce&s;&s;ation, have experi|enced much greater vigour of con&s;titution than they had known for many years before; but there are others who &s;uffer &s;o much inconvenience from this &s;ource, as to render &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>About the time when this particular change in the habit takes place, many women experience complaints which prove extremely trouble&s;ome, and, if neglected, very dangerous:&mdash; &s;uch as, flu&s;hing heats, re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, want of &s;leep, trouble&s;ome or frightful dreams, &s;pa&s;modic pains of the &s;tomach and bowels, and &s;ometimes &s;welled ancles, with pain and inflam|mation. After this alteration has taken place, &s;ometimes women &s;uddenly grow bigger and grow unwieldy; their legs &s;well, their body is co&s;tive, the urine in &s;mall quantities and often di&s;charged with every appearance of the Drop&s;y.&mdash;The Tonic Powders and Drops, in the two la&s;t ca&s;es, with regular exerci&s;e, I have never known to fail in effecting a cure. Strong purgatives which are generally pre&s;cribed, prove extremely injurious.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="56">
<P>A proper regimen at this period &s;hould be attentively ob&s;erv|ed.&mdash;Tho&s;e females. who are of a full habit of body, &s;ubject to feveri&s;h heats, and of a &s;trong con&s;titution, &s;hould adhere to a moderately cooling and light diet; every thing that is heat|ing &s;hould be religiou&s;ly avoided, e&s;pecially &s;pirits, and even wine ought to be taken in great moderation; the patient &s;hould le&s;&s;en the u&s;ual quantity of animal food, and ab&s;tain from meat &s;uppers, the liberal u&s;e of vegetables, with a proper degree of exerci&s;e, and pure cool air &s;hould be attended to; large a&s;&s;em|blies, or hot clo&s;e rooms, &s;hould be avoided. As the mind has great influence over bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly health, it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary to keep that as tranquil as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But where the patient is weakly, and not troubled with feveri&s;h heats, and is of a thin habit of body, a more gene|rous diet &s;hould be allowed; a gla&s;s or two of wine after dinner and &s;upper may be needful; at the &s;ame time, whatever will induce an unnatural heat, e&s;pecially &s;pirituous liquors, mu&s;t be avoided, Proper exerci&s;e and whole&s;ome air &s;hould be at|tended to. The &s;ea or cold bathing may be u&s;ed with great advantage, where the lungs or other internal parts are &s;ound,</P>
<P>Tho&s;e medicines, on which females place great reliance, u&s;ually taken at this period, being very injurious, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall enu|merate &s;ome of their baneful effects:</P>
<P>The&s;e are not only extremely pernicious to the con&s;titution, but produce mo&s;t dreadful di&s;orders of the womb.&mdash;The Scotch Pills, Hoopers Female Pills, Analeptic, and, in &s;hort, the whole tribe of pills, in general u&s;e for this purpo&s;e; are all detrimental to the animal oeconomy. Aloes, of which the&s;e pills are compo&s;ed, though a good medicine in it&s;elf, has been fatally abu&s;ed, and has done more mi&s;chief than any other
<PB N="56" REF="57">drug whatever. Its operation is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the real intention of nature; for it determines the blood to the womb, and &s;trongly &s;timulates it and the contiguous parts, which con&s;equently promotes the periodical di&s;charge at a time when naturally it is about to cea&s;e. Whatever tends to en|courage the flow, when it is the law of nature to decline that particular office, mu&s;t certainly be injurious. Inflammation, ulceration, and cancer of the womb, with floodings, more frequently ari&s;e from the effects of the&s;e pills, than have been hitherto known or imagined.</P>
<P>During &s;uckling, many per&s;ons are in the habit of taking Scotch and Hoopers Pills, with a view to keep the body open, &mdash; but this practice tends to interrupt the natural proce&s;s, by le&s;&s;ening the quantity of milk and injuring its quality. In the&s;e ca&s;es, Lenitive Electuary, Senna tea, with Cream of Tartar, and Ca&s;tor Oil, are pre&s;erable to either the Scotch or Hooper's Pills; but the TONIC POWDERS are, for this purpo&s;e, far &s;uperior to any other medicine.</P>
<P>My worthy friend, the late Dr. FOTHERGILL, (who&s;e abilities, honor, and veracity, no one with ju&s;tice ever di&s;|puted,) has made many judicious remarks re&s;pecting the in|jurious effects of tho&s;e medicines, which are compo&s;ed of aloes, and pre&s;cribed for women at this particular time. He &s;ays&mdash;</P>
<P>"An opinion generally prevails among the &s;ex, that purga|tives are particularly nece&s;&s;ary at this juncture; preparations of aloes are, therefore, recommended, from one to another, as proper purgatives to be u&s;ed at this particular period.</P>
<P>"But, if we reflect upon the known effects of this drug, in all its preparations, we &s;hall find it almo&s;t uniformly pro|ducing
<PB N="57" REF="58">the piles, if taken long together, from its &s;timulating the ve&s;&s;els at the extremity of the Rectum, called the He|morrhoidal Veins, and the contiguous parts.</P>
<P>"In&s;tead, therefore, of countenancing a treatment, which is not only unrea&s;onable in theory, but injurious in practice&mdash;every opportunity ought to be embraced to expo&s;e and correct a popular error, than which there perhaps are few in the circle of medicine that are more mi&s;chievous. Repeated in|&s;tances have occurred in my practice, of grievous inconveni|ences ari&s;ing from the&s;e heating medicines; the piles, &s;tran|gury, racking pains in the loins, repre&s;enting labour pains, and other &s;imilar complaints."</P>

<P>I cannot but expre&s;s my gratitude for your curing me of a mo&s;t violent fit of the Gout, in &s;o rapid a manner as I have ex|perienced.

<P>A YOUNG LADY was afflicted many months with the Rheu|matic Gout: the &s;everity of the pains (which were without intermi&s;&s;ion) deprived her of re&s;t, had reduced her &s;trength, and emaciated her body to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he was unable to get out of bed, or even to &s;eed her&s;elf. She had taken va|rious medicines before &s;he &s;ent to me without having re|ceived the lea&s;t benefit from them: on the contrary, the di&s;order daily increa&s;ed, and (her &s;trength being nearly exhau&s;ted by pain, want of &s;leep, and lo&s;s of appetite) her recovery was de|&s;paired of by every one who &s;aw her. Under the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, &s;he was per&s;uaded to &s;end for me, after I had attended her, and given her my medicines for about one month, all her com|plaints were removed, except a &s;mall degree of weakne&s;s from which &s;he &s;oon recovered.</P>

<P>MR. SEALY, No. 1, Compton Street Bloom&s;bury, was afflicted with the Rheumatic Gout in all his limps, for the &s;pace of &s;ix months.

During all this time a variety of medicine had been pre&s;cribed, without producing any benefit. At length he applied to me, and after taking my medicines, and &s;trictly following my advice, he got entirely rid of all his complaints in the cour&s;e of two weeks, except a degree of weakne&s;s, for which he took the Tonic Drops, joined to a preparation of the Peruvian Bark: by which method, together with a nouri&s;hing diet, and now and then interpo&s;ing the Tonic Powders when co&s;tive, his health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>A CHILD, about four years of age, was &s;eized with a Drop|&s;ical &s;welling of the face (two weeks after having a nettle ra&s;h), which proceeded to the hands, feet, and legs; and the body appeared &s;imilar to a mere lump of dough, attended with great difficulty of breathing, lo&s;s of appetite, &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, very high fever, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and in&s;atiable thir&s;t.
