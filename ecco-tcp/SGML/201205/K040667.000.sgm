<P>This is (in his own Words) all that he &s;ays about it: Which, for the Benefit of tho&s;e that don't under&s;tand <HI>French,</HI> I &s;hall tran&s;late into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> thus:</P>
<P><Q>"He &s;ays, he had a Child about two Years old, who had a Stone in the Bladder as big as a Hen's Egg, brought to him to cut: He u&s;ed all his Dexterity to force the Stone down to the Neck of the Bladder, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to be done: The Child was in that Torture and Mi&s;ery, that the Parents wi&s;hed him rather dead, than he &s;hould live longer in &s;o doleful a Condition. <HI>De Franco,</HI> on the other Hand, thinking it would tend to his Di&s;honour not to take away the Stone, at la&s;t re|&s;olv'd to make Tryal, whether he could not bring it to the very Groin, which he did, by putting his Fingers into the Fun|dament, and rai&s;ing up the Stone, he caus'd his Servant, on the other Side oppo&s;ite to him, to pre&s;s it down to the Place in|tended for Inci&s;ion; which he made, took out the Stone, and, tho' the Child was
<PB N="6" REF="5">very weak, recover'd him, and heal'd the Wound: But he advi&s;es others not to fol|low his Example; and, in&s;tead of it, re|commends the Operation which he calls his own Invention, and has de&s;crib'd, in the foregoing Part of the &s;ame Chapter."</Q></P>
<P>The next to him, that's &s;aid to have per|form'd it, is one <HI>Bonnet,</HI> of whom Mon&s;. <HI>Tollet,</HI> in the 5th Edition of his <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> publi&s;h'd at <HI>Paris</HI> 1708, gives the following Account, Page 139.</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Feu M.</HI> Jonnot <HI>m'a dit autrefois que M.</HI> Bonnet <HI>Chirurgien, qui praetiquoit il ya tres-long-temps la Lithotomie dans l'</HI> H&ocirc;tel Dieu <HI>de</HI> Paris, <HI>l'avoit a&s;&s;ur&eacute; d'en avoir taill&eacute; de cette faaeon. M.</HI> Petit, <HI>Maitre Chirurgien faaeon de cet Ho&s;pital m&agrave; dit l'avoir vu pratique &s;ur une Petite fille par le m&ecirc;me M.</HI> Bonnet."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Mr. <HI>Tollet</HI> &s;ays, that the late Mr. <HI>Jonnot</HI> (who was al&s;o a famous <HI>Lithotomi&s;t</HI>) told him formerly, that Mr. <HI>Bonnet,</HI> a Surgeon, who practis'd <HI>Lithotomy</HI> a con&s;iderable Time ago in the <HI>Hotel Dieu</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd him, (<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Jonnot</HI>) that he had cut after that Manner. Mr. <HI>Petit,</HI> Ma&s;ter-Sur|geon of that Ho&s;pital, al&s;o told our Au|thor, that he had &s;een it practi&s;ed by the &s;ame <HI>Bonnet</HI> on a young Girl."</Q></P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>Mon&s;. <HI>Dionis,</HI> in the 2d Edition of his <HI>Cour&s;e of Chirurgical Operations,</HI> publi&s;h'd at <HI>Paris</HI> 1714, Page 139, gives the following Account of the &s;ame Man, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>"<HI>On nous a&s;&s;ure que Mon&s;ieur</HI> Bonnet <HI>a pratiqu&eacute; &s;ovent cette Operation &agrave; l'</HI>H&ocirc;tel Dieu <HI>de</HI> Paris <HI>avec une heureux &s;ucc&eacute;s, &amp; que m&ecirc;me Mon&s;ieur Petit luy a v&ucirc; faire.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q>"We are a&s;&s;ur'd, that Mon&s;. <HI>Bonnet,</HI> fre|quently and with good Succe&s;s, perform'd this Operation at the <HI>Hotel Dieu</HI> in <HI>Paris;</HI> and that Mon&s;. <HI>Petit</HI> has &s;een him perform it."</Q> This is all the Account that I have met with of this <HI>Bonnet.</HI></P>
<P>After him, Dr. <HI>Groenevelt</HI> was the next that perform'd it, of which he gives the fol|lowing Account in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Edition of his <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> publi&s;h'd at <HI>London</HI> in 1710.</P>
<P><Q>"I once had a Patient in <HI>Long Lane, Moor|fields,</HI> upon whom I was oblig'd to per|form this High Operation; and very &s;uc|ce&s;sfully extracted the Stone, by making Inci&s;ion near the Groin, the Patient &s;oon recovering; which &s;hews, that Wounds in the fibrous Part of the Bladder are not always mortal."</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e are the only Three that I have met with, that ever pretended to have cut above the <HI>Os Pubis, i. e.</HI> into the Belly.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P><HI>Franco</HI> cut &s;o fir&s;t, becau&s;e he had a Pa|tient that he could not cut his own Way, tho', at the &s;ame Time, he had the Cha|racter of one of the be&s;t <HI>Lithotomi&s;ts</HI> of his Age. But tho' he &s;ucceeded, yet, it &s;eems, he found &s;uch Difficulties in it, that he would never do't again, and charges us never to follow his Example; which one would have expected that he &s;hould have explain'd in his Account of it, the better to deter others from the like Practice.</P>
<P><HI>Bonnet</HI> is &s;aid to have done it &s;everal Times with Succe&s;s; yet he don't recommend it to others as a Rule of Practice, nor was ever imitated by any of his Contemporaries.</P>
<P><HI>Groenevelt</HI> did it but once, and &s;ays, he was oblig'd to do it: I &s;uppo&s;e, in &s;ome &s;uch|like Ca&s;e as <HI>De Franco</HI>'s; and though he al&s;o &s;ucceeded, yet, in&s;tead of recommending it, he only draws this Con&s;equence from it, <HI>viz.</HI> That Wounds of the fibrous Part of the Bladder are not always mortal.</P>
<P><HI>Franco</HI> cut on the Hair above the <HI>Pubis,</HI> a little on one Side; <HI>Groenevelt</HI> near the Groin: But not one of them tells us what lu&s;truments they u&s;ed, or which Way they u&s;ed them; whether they made a cro&s;s, ob|lique, or longitudinal Inci&s;ion; whether they made the Inci&s;ion at once, or at &s;everal Times, or what Po&s;ition they put their Pa|tient in; all which, and many more Cir|cum&s;tances, ought to have been exactly de|&s;crib'd, before any one could be &s;aid to have
<PB N="9" REF="8">follow'd their Method; from whence I may very &s;afely infer, that it will be no ea&s;y matter to tell which Way any of them made their Operations, and yet it's commonly a&s;&s;erted with the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance (not with any De&s;ign to rai&s;e <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Reputation, but to le&s;&s;en mine) that I made this Operation after <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Method, though he has told but very little of his Story, and I have told none of mine.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that it's a Mi|racle to me, that after &s;o much Succe&s;s, either they, or tho&s;e that &s;aw them do it, did not ei|ther continue the Practice of it, or give us more &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons why they di&s;approv'd of it; &s;o far from that, they have not given us one In&s;tance of a Patient's dying after this Section.</P>
<P>This Operation is al&s;o recommended as a very probable Way by <HI>Rou&s;&s;ecus, Dionis,</HI> &amp;c. yet not one of them was ever &s;o far per&s;wa|ded of it as to make the Experiment, how|ever &s;everal of them have undertaken (which none that ever made the Operation thought fit to do) to de&s;cribe the Method how it may be done, <HI>i. e.</HI> to teach others to perform what they can't do them&s;elves; (which, in my Opinion is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity in Nature;) but to what Purpo&s;e, he that makes the Ex|periment will &s;ee.</P>
<P>Having thus recited all the In&s;tances that I have met with of the Stone in the Bladder, being extracted through the Belly, in the Words of the Authors, That every one may
<PB N="10" REF="9">be a Judge of the Encouragement I had to undertake this Operation from what has been done this Way before.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next give an Account of the Ob|jections made again&s;t the fore-mention'd Gen|tlemens Operations, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t au|thentick Authors that have mention'd them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some &s;ay that the Urine from the Bladder, and the Di&s;charge from the Wound, will flow into the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> or <HI>Pelvis,</HI> where Corrupting, will occa&s;ion &s;everal grievous and incurable Symptoms, among&s;t whom is Dr. <HI>Drelincount,</HI> &amp;c. who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Operatio Franconiana ut inventa e&s;t &s;ic exolevit, quia dum perfunderetur Ve&s;icae fun|dum Urina Effluebat in Abdominis Cavum &amp; Mortem inducit,</HI> i. e."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"The <HI>Franconian</HI> Section, <HI>viz.</HI> the high Operation, died a&s;&s;oon as it was invented; becau&s;e when the Fund of the Bladder is perforated, the Urine flows into the Cavity of the Belly and cau&s;es Death."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Others &s;ay that the Wound being made in the membranous Part of the Bladder, won't heal again, among&s;t whom is <HI>Bar|bett,</HI> &amp;c. who has the&s;e Words:</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P><Q>"<HI>Periculo&s;a interim &amp; in &s;e mole&s;ta Operatio e&s;t, &amp; quod &s;i Labia Vulneris in Ve&s;ia facti haud uniantur Mu&s;culis Abdominis, exulceratio ve&s;icae &s;equitur, magis dolorifica minus cura|bilis ip&s;o Calculo, quae etiam incommoda effe|cerunt quod minus Operationibus aliis haberi coeperit &agrave; practicis veris,</HI> i. e."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"It's a dangerous and in it &s;elf a trouble|&s;ome Operation; and if the Lips of the Wound made in the Bladder don't unite to the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> an Ulcera|tion of the Bladder will follow, more pain|ful and le&s;s curable than the Stone it &s;elf, which Inconveniencies have made it le&s;s e&s;teem'd than the other Operations by true Practitioners."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>Thevinin,</HI> a very eminent Surgeon, in his Book of Chirurgical Ob&s;er|vations, publi&s;h'd at <HI>Paris</HI> in the Year 1669, <HI>Pag.</HI> 68. gives this Account of it, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>"<HI>L'hault appareil qui a e&s;te premierement prati|qu&eacute; par de Franco n'e&s;t point en u&s;age &agrave; pre&s;ent, &agrave; Cau&s;e de l'inci&s;ion qui'l oblige de faire au fonds &amp; corps inferieur de la ve&s;&s;ic qui apporte de grand accidens,</HI> i. e."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"The high Operation, fir&s;t practisd by <HI>de Franco,</HI> is no more in U&s;e, becau&s;e the In|ci&s;ion being made in the Fund and Body of the Bladder cau&s;es great Accidents."</Q></P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Others &s;ay that the Guts will bur&s;t out at the Wound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Fienus,</HI> in the 70th Page of his Book, <HI>De praecipuis Artis Chirurgicae controver&s;is,</HI> Edit. 1602. gives his Opinion of this high Operation, in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Praeter hactenus u&s;itatam Sectionem exorcus e&s;t, Franci&s;us Rou&s;ettus, qui in Libro &s;uo de Partu Cae&s;ario &s;cribit, videri longe &s;ecurio|rem &amp; faciliorem &s;ectionis rationem futuram, &s;i Venter aut Abdomen a Latere &s;ub umbilico aperiantur, &amp; impo&s;ita per foramen manu ve&s;icae corpus vulneretur &amp; inde calculus exi|matur. Sed illa ratio non valet: ve&s;icae enim vulnus lethale e&s;t, &amp; non pote&s;t con&s;olidari, &amp; quamvis aliquando legatur con&s;olidatum, e&s;t tamen rara avis, &amp; temerarium nimis foret, &amp; quia illam rationem nemo &s;ecutus e&s;t, de ea non agimus,</HI> i. e."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Be&s;ides the common Ways of Cutting, there's one <HI>Fr. Rou&s;ettus,</HI> who affirms in his Book of the <HI>Cae&s;arian</HI> Birth, that the Operation would be &s;afer and ea&s;ier, if we cut through the Belly (a little below the Navel, and on one Side) and into the Bladder, and then extracted the Stone through the Wound. But that can't be, becau&s;e Wounds of the Bladder are mor|tal, and cannot be con&s;olidated; altho' we have &s;ome Hi&s;tories of their being cur'd,
<PB N="13" REF="12">it's a great Rarity, and therefore it's too ra&s;h an Undertaking; and becau&s;e no Body practi&s;es it, I'll &s;ay no more on't."</Q></P>
<P>The An&s;wer to all which (not to de&s;cend to Particulars) is the happy Succe&s;s of my Operation.</P>
<P>The next Que&s;tion that naturally follows, is, What could incite or encourage me to undertake this high Operation, which tho&s;e that had done it, had &s;uch an indifferent Opi|nion of, which tho&s;e eminent Authors (ju&s;t quoted, and almo&s;t every one el&s;e that have mention'd it) exclaim'd &s;o warmly again&s;t, and which, by the common Con&s;ent of Man|kind, was deem'd impracticable?</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer: That it was, fir&s;t, becau&s;e I was fully per&s;waded that the great Danger, Tediou&s;ne&s;s, and frequent bad Con|&s;equences of the common Operations, were entirely owing to the Structure of the Parts concern'd, which the be&s;t Operator could not avoid, if the Stone was of any con&s;i|derable Bigne&s;s, or of a rugged irregular Figure.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e I was as firmly per|&s;waded, that all the Objections made again&s;t the fore mention'd Gentlemens Operations, (&s;o far as they concern mine) were very ill grounded; which is prov'd by the Succe&s;s.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>The Two Operations that are only in U&s;e now among&s;t us are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That which Sur|geons call Cutting on the Staffe, <HI>i. e.</HI> When a furrow'd Probe is pa&s;s'd into the Bladder, upon which they afterwards Cut.</P>
<P>The other is call'd cutting on the Gripe, <HI>i. e.</HI> When they pa&s;s their Fingers into the Fundament, and pre&s;s the Stone outwards, and then cut upon it.</P>
<P>In order to explain what I have ju&s;t now a&s;&s;erted, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Danger, Tediou&s;|ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the common Operations, are entirely owing to the Structure of the Parts concern'd. I &s;hall fir&s;t de&s;cribe the Parts concern'd in each, and then make &s;uch Con|clu&s;ions as naturally follow therefrom.</P>
<P>Cutting on the Staffe is mo&s;t in U&s;e, and therefore I &s;hall begin with it.</P>
<P><HI>Parts concern'd in Cutting on the Staffe, or Great Apparatus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Parts Cut:</HI></P>
<P>They cut fir&s;t through the Skin, on one &s;ide of the <HI>Rapha</HI> of the <HI>Perinaeum.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Through the <HI>Accelerator Mu&s;cle.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Through the Bulb of the <HI>Urethra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Parts that are dilated.</HI></P>
<P>The Inci&s;ion being made, opens a Pa&s;&s;age into the membranous Part of the <HI>Uretha,</HI> at the upper-end of which is the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder, through both which the In&s;tru|ments
<PB N="15" REF="14">mu&s;t pa&s;s into the Bladder, and the Stone, tho' enlarg'd by the Thickne&s;s of the <HI>Forceps,</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s out.</P>
<P>They are both apt to be too much dilated by a large, and lacerated by a rugged Stone.</P>
<P>The membranous <HI>Urethra,</HI> is about Two Inches long, more or le&s;s, according to the Bigne&s;s of the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>It's about as big (in a middle-&s;iz'd Man) as to admit of a Goo&s;e Quill.</P>
<P>It's much longer, and not &s;o thick and &s;trong, as the <HI>Urethra</HI> in Women, and con&s;e|quently more liable to be injur'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sphincter</HI> is a few circular Fibres; which keep the Bladder &s;hut, and &s;o prevents the involuntary Di&s;charge of the Urine.</P>
<P><HI>The Genital Parts, which by the Nearne&s;s of their Situation are liable to be injur'd, next after the foremention'd, are:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales,</HI> i. e. the Re|&s;ervatories of the Seed: They are &s;ituate im|mediately behind the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> between the Bladder and <HI>Rectum,</HI> i. e. the &s;traight Gut.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Their <HI>Ducts;</HI> which pa&s;s from them, and open about the Middle of the membranous Part of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> by Two Orifices, which are cover'd by a &s;ort of a Caruncle, call'd, <HI>Caput Gallinaginis,</HI> or <HI>Veru|montanum;</HI> which &s;erves in&s;tead of <HI>Valves,</HI> to hinder the involuntary emi&s;&s;ion of the Seed.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Pro&s;tatae;</HI> which are &s;ituate a Little below the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminoles,</HI> between the membranous <HI>Urethra</HI> and &s;traight Gut.</P>
<P>The Structure and Situation of the Parts being thus &s;tated, it will not be difficult to deduce all die foremention'd Inconveniencies from them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Danger of this Operation (to &s;ay no more) will appear from a Computati|on of the Number of tho&s;e that do and do not e&s;cape after it; which is (in general) oc|ca&s;ion'd by the Length and Streightne&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;age before de&s;crib'd, Figure and Bigne&s;s of the Stones, Force requir'd to extract them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whence the foremention'd Parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are lacerated and contu&s;ed to too great a Degree, and thence exce&s;&s;ive Pain, Hemorrhagy, Lo&s;s of Strength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> too great to be ma&s;ter'd.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Every one that has made, or &s;een any Number of the&s;e Operations perform'd, cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of them (and con&s;equently of the Pain the Pa|tient mu&s;t needs &s;uffer) which is owing to the Length and Streightne&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;age (which cannot be alter'd, as is commonly &s;uppos'd, by enlarging the External Orifice,) Num|ber, and Nece&s;&s;ary Largene&s;s of the In&s;tru|ments u&s;ed; Number, Bigne&s;s, and Figure of the Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The bad Con&s;equences that fre|quently follow this Operation (in tho&s;e that
<PB N="17" REF="16">e&s;cape with Life) are, <HI>Incontinency of Urine, Impotency, Fi&s;tula's, &amp;c.</HI> which every one mu&s;t be &s;atisfy'd of, that have &s;een any Number of them: In &s;ome of whom you'll ob&s;erve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>Incontinency of Urine,</HI> in others <HI>Impotency,</HI> in others <HI>Fi&s;tula'</HI>s, in others all of them; any one of which is very little better than the Stone it&s;elf.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Cau&s;e of the Incontinency of Urine.</HEAD>
<P>It's cau&s;ed when the Sphincter of the Blad|der is over-&s;tretched by the Bigne&s;s, or lace|rated by the A&s;peritys of the Stone; becau&s;e it can never afterwards do its Office as before; And &s;o the Urine flows involuntarily Day and Night; which keeps them always wet, from whence none of the mo&s;t agreeable Scents ari&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Cau&s;e of the Impotency.</HEAD>
<P>It's occa&s;ion'd by the Laceration of the Ducts of the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales,</HI> or the <HI>Veru|montanum;</HI> and that by the Bigne&s;s or A&s;pe|ritys of the Stone, as before: So when the Wound heals, the Ducts, or <HI>Verumonta|num;</HI> are &s;topp'd by the <HI>Callous,</HI> &s;o that the Seed can no more flow into the <HI>Urethra.</HI></P>

<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HEAD>Cau&s;e of Fi&s;tula's.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e Parts are Membranous, Nervous, or Spermatick, as Authors call them, and, of Cour&s;e, very unapt to heal when wounded, lacerated, or contu&s;ed; which is al&s;o in|creas'd by the con&s;tant Pa&s;&s;age of the Urine, Gravel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thro' the Wound, and &s;o they turn fi&s;tulous; and then all or a great Part of the Urine, which &s;hould pa&s;s thro' the Yard, pa&s;&s;es thro' the Fi&s;tula left in the Wound; whence People are made nau&s;eous to them&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>The Great <HI>Hildanus, pag.</HI> 733, expre&s;&s;es the Danger of this Operation in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Ingens ac magnus Calculus ut per Collum Ve&s;icae extrabatur, propter ejus angu&s;tiam longum requirit tempus, interim aeger ingen|tibus affligitur Doloribus, Ve&s;ica, ip&s;iu&s;que Fibrae dilacerantur, Sanguis copio&s;&egrave; profluit, vires di&s;&s;olvuntur, maximoque cum Cruciatu aeger vel in ip&s;a Operatione aut paul&ograve; po&s;t extinguitur,</HI> i. e."</Q></P>
<P><Q>"When a large Stone is extracted through the Neck of the Bladder, becau&s;e of its Streightne&s;s, it takes up a long Time: In the mean Time, the Patient &s;uffers intole|rable Pain, the Bladder and its Fibres are
<PB N="19" REF="18">tore, there's a great Flux of Blood, Lo&s;s of Strength, and the Patient, by rea&s;on of the great Torture, dies, either in or &s;oon after the Operation."</Q></P>
<P>The late Mr. <HI>Couper,</HI> in his Comment upon <HI>Bidloo,</HI> has the following Ob&s;ervations on the Accidents which happen from the Stru|cture of the Parts.</P>
<P><Q>"This Part of the <HI>Urethra, viz.</HI> that be|tween the <HI>Pro&s;tatae</HI> and the <HI>Bulb,</HI> is liable to be wounded, and &s;ometimes perforated, by too ha&s;tily introducing the Conductor into the Bladder, after an Inci&s;ion is made in the <HI>Perinaeum</HI> in Cutting for the Stone; whereby the Operator afterwards thru&s;ts his <HI>Forceps</HI> between the Bladder and <HI>Re|ctum.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q>"This Inadvertency, I'm per&s;uaded, is very often practi&s;ed by the Pretenders to <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> and frequently proves fatal to the Patient: One would think it hardly po&s;&s;ible, that a Man in his Sen&s;es, and but tolerably acquainted with Anatomy, could commit &s;uch Errors; yet, of this I have met with more than one In&s;tance, when being called to di&s;&s;ect the Decea&s;ed, in whom &s;uch Operators have been &s;o un|fortunate as to leave the Stone &s;till in the Bladder."</Q></P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P>So much to &s;hew the unavoidable Danger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Cutting on the <HI>Staffe.</HI></P>
<P>The other Operation in u&s;e is Cutting on the <HI>Gripe.</HI></P>
<P>Parts cut.</P>
<P>They cut (farther off of the <HI>Rapha</HI> of the <HI>Perinaeum</HI> than in the foregoing Operation) 1. Through the Skin: 2. The Fat: 3. Part of the <HI>Erector Penis:</HI> 4. Some confiderable Blood-Ve&s;&s;els: 5. A Part of the <HI>Levator Ani:</HI> 6. Into the Body of the Bladder above the <HI>Sphincter.</HI></P>
<P>This Operation can't always be practis'd, becau&s;e our Fingers are not long enough to bring down and keep the Stone fa&s;t again&s;t the <HI>Perinaeum</HI> in grown People. Though, when it can be done,</P>
<P><HI>The Inconveniencies of it are,</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. When the Stone is rough, it's trouble|&s;ome, painful, and tedious, to make the In|ci&s;ion on it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Arteries, which are cut, are often very large.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. When the Stone is rough, it pricks, and contu&s;es the Bladder in &s;everal Places, by being pre&s;&s;ed hard again&s;t the <HI>Perinaeum;</HI> whence &s;everal dangerous and deadly Symp|toms en&s;ue.</ITEM>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<ITEM>4. The Wound in the Bladder being de|pending, is hinder'd from aglutinating, by the Gravel and Urine pa&s;&s;ing thro' it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>From all which, I think 'tis evident, that the rare Succe&s;s of the&s;e Operations, even in the be&s;t of Hands, (not to mention the Havock that is often made by Pretenders) is entirely owing to the Structure of the Parts concern'd; which is what I undertook to prove.</P>
<P><HI>Advantages of this new Operation.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas, in the other Operations, the Danger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are owing to the Structure of the Parts; in my Operation, by rea&s;on of the Structure of the Parts, they are &s;ucce&s;s|fully prevented. <HI>E. G.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. There can be no Impotency cau&s;ed by it, becau&s;e there's none of the Genital Parts can be injur'd in doing it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There can be no Incontinency of Urine caus'd by it, becau&s;e the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder cannot be hurt in making it.</P>
<P N="3">3. There can be no Fi&s;tula after it, if pro|per Care is taken of the Wound.</P>
<P N="4">4. There can be no &s;uch Force requir'd to extract the Stone, as will contu&s;e and lace|rate the Parts, which, in the other Opera|tions, are the Cau&s;e of Symptoms too hard to be govern'd) becau&s;e the Wound may be
<PB N="22" REF="21">made as large as you plea&s;e, which can't be done in them.</P>
<P N="5">5. There can't be any Flux of Blood, becau&s;e there's no Occa&s;ion to cut any of the great Ve&s;&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus the Defects of the others are &s;upply'd by this.</P>
<P>My Patient was between &s;ixteen and &s;e|venteen Years of Age, and was cut two Days before la&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> and in a Month's Time the Wound was perfectly cicatriz'd, <HI>i.e.</HI> healed.</P>
<P>The Operation was over in one Minute, and I believe will never be above two.</P>
<P>He now performs all his natural Faculties as well as he had never been troubled with the Stone.</P>
<P>There were two Phy&s;icians, two Surgeons, and an Apothecary, pre&s;ent at the Opera|tion: But to &s;ave them the Trouble of an|&s;wering every little Prig's impertinent Que|&s;tions, I don't think it's proper to mention them.</P>
<P>The Stone was of the Bigne&s;s and Figure expre&s;s'd in the Plate following.</P>

<P>Some &s;ay that I have robb'd the Dead of their Right, and endeavour'd to impo&s;e on the Living, by putting my own Name to another Man's Work, and pretending that it's a new Operation, though, at the &s;ame Time, it was practis'd by its fir&s;t Inventor, <HI>De Franco,</HI> above 150 Years ago.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<P><HI>De Franco</HI> (who&s;e Memory I reverence, becau&s;e he was certainly an excellent Sur|geon, and one of the be&s;t <HI>Lithotomi&s;ts</HI> in his Time) is &s;o far from valuing him&s;elf upon the <HI>High Operation,</HI> which he was once forc'd to make, that he owns him&s;elf to be very much to blame for doing of it; and de&s;ires no Man afterwards to follow his Example; and in the Room of that, in the preceding Part of that very &s;ame Chapter, recom|mends another which is made on the <HI>Peri|naeum,</HI> which he a&s;&s;umes, and, with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, calls his own Invention.</P>
<P><HI>Hildanus</HI> is al&s;o of the &s;ame Opinion, and expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus, <HI>Pag.</HI> 730.</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>De quarto operandi modo, in</HI> Lithotomia <HI>u&s;itato, qui merito</HI> Lithotomia Franconiana <HI>appellari pote&s;t.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>And &s;o he goes on to de&s;cribe and re|commend that Operation, which <HI>De Franco</HI> owns in the 33d Chapter of his Book, to be his proper Invention: But it's not the <HI>High,</HI> but an Operation in the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> that's a&s;|&s;um'd by the one, and commended by the other.</P>
<P>In Page 732, he has the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>"Franci&s;cus Rou&s;ettus <HI>Lib. de partu</HI> Cae&s;a|rio <HI>concludere voluit, &s;emper calculum eo in
<PB N="25" REF="24">Loco ex&s;ecandum e&s;&s;e, illudque minori cum pe|riculo fieri po&s;&s;e.</HI> Lithotomiam <HI>proinde illam</HI> Franconianam <HI>vocat, cum tamen D.</HI> Franc. <HI>eam minim&egrave; ad Imitationem prae&s;crip&s;erit, &s;ed expre&s;&s;&egrave; in Libro &s;uo, &s;e &s;tolide egi&s;&s;e fateatur, adeoque unumquemque, ne ip&s;um hac in parte imitetur, &s;ed precedentem operandi modum amplectatur, Hortetur.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Franci&s;cus Rou&s;ettus,</HI> in his Book on the <HI>Cae&s;arian</HI> Birth, a&s;&s;erts, that we ought al|ways to cut for the Stone through the lower Part of the Belly, becau&s;e it can be done with a great deal le&s;s Danger; and then calls it <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Method, notwith|&s;tanding <HI>De Franco</HI> never pre&s;crib'd it as a Rule; &s;o far from which, he confe&s;&s;es in his own Book, that he acted fooli&s;hly in doing it; and therefore advi&s;es us never to imitate him in it, but in the Operation ju&s;t before de&s;crib'd."</Q></P>
<P>He concludes his Story thus:</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Cum dicto igitur D.</HI> Franco, <HI>fideli atque indu&s;trio cuivis Chirurgo periculo&s;ae hujus</HI> Lithotomiae <HI>Admini&s;trationem iterum atque iterum di&s;&s;uadeo.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Therefore, with the foremention'd <HI>De Franco,</HI> I again and again di&s;&s;uade every faithful and indu&s;trious Surgeon from per|forming this dangerous Operation."</Q></P>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<P>From all which I conclude, that in&s;tead of being an Honour to <HI>De Franco,</HI> to have had his Name put to it, it would have been a real Injury to the Memory of the Dead, to have made him the Author of an Operation, that he blam'd him&s;elf for doing when alive.</P>
<P>Nay, I'm &s;o far from having an Opinion of <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Operation, as he has de&s;crib'd it, that I think it's fully as incon&s;i&s;tent and impracticable as <HI>Talicotius</HI>'s Project of re|&s;toring lo&s;t No&s;es.</P>
<P>All the Analogy between his and mine, is, that they are both made in the Belly. But his was made in one Place of the Belly, and mine in another: His, with his own In&s;truments, (which he has not men|tion'd) mine with mine: His were u&s;ed af|ter one Manner, mine after another: And tho&s;e, I think, are the mo&s;t material Diffe|rences betwixt any two Operations, <HI>viz.</HI> The Variation of the Place upon which the Ope|ration is made, of the Number, Figure, and Size of the In&s;truments, and of the Method of u&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The two foremention'd Operations, call'd, Cutting on the <HI>Staffe,</HI> and Cutting on the <HI>Gripe,</HI> are both made on the <HI>Perinaeum:</HI> The De&s;ign of both is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> To extract
<PB N="27" REF="26">the Stone out of the Bladder; yet no Man ever was &s;o ab&s;urd as to call them both the &s;ame Operations, for the Rea&s;ons before|mention'd.</P>
<P>The late famous Mr. <HI>Rau,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick and Surgery at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and the fore|mention'd <HI>De Franco,</HI> and &s;everal others, as <HI>Cel&s;us, Guido, Marianus, &amp;c.</HI> had each a par|ticular Method of Cutting on the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> to which every one gave his own Name, and why &s;hould not I be allow'd the &s;ame Liberty.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that my Operation was, in every Tittle, the &s;ame as <HI>De Franco</HI>'s; yet, if it's found to be a &s;afer and ea&s;ier Way of relieving the Mi&s;erable, it's neverthele&s;s new; for that Operation was as much dead, before mine, and thought as much im|practicable, (which the general Opinion of the Town on this Occa&s;ion abundantly proves) as it was 150 Years before <HI>De Franco</HI> was born.</P>
<P>I readily grant, that one Operation, tho' &s;ucce&s;sfully perform'd, is not enough to &s;a|tisfy the Publick that it's the &s;afe&s;t Method; but it's enough to me, who, before the Ope|ration, thought my&s;elf very &s;ure of Succe&s;s, el&s;e I had never attempted it. But now I have perform'd it, and &s;een the whole Pro|ce&s;s of the Cure, I'm in no manner of Pain
<PB N="28" REF="27">about the future Succe&s;s of if; nay, I dare venture to prophecy, that not one in ten will die, nor one in fifty want a perfect Cure, that do after the common Methods; and there fore do (what never any did before) recom|mend it as the mo&s;t ea&s;y &s;afe, and &s;peedy Method of extracting the Stone, (exclu&s;ive of all others) in Males, and when the Stone is large, in Females.</P>
<P>I have had a great many vile, malicious and &s;alfe Reflections ca&s;t upon me, on this Occa&s;ion, by a Set of <HI>Scioli,</HI> who (becau&s;e they never did anything out of the common Road them&s;elves) envy every Man el&s;e that does.</P>
<P>The Imputation of Novelty (&s;ays the great Mr. <HI>Lock</HI>) is a terrible Charge among tho&s;e who judge of Mens Heads, as they do of their Perukes, by the Fa&s;hion, and can allow none to be right but the receiv'd Doctrines. Truth &s;carce ever carry'd it by Vote any where at its fir&s;t Appearance: New Opi|nions are always &s;u&s;pected, and u&s;ually op|pos'd, without any other Rea&s;on, but be|cau&s;e they are not already common: But Truth, like Gold, is not the le&s;s &s;o, for be|ing newly brought out of the Mine.</P>
