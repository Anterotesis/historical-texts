<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Breeding of <HI>Worms</HI> in Human Bodies.</HEAD>
<P>THAT our Bodies &s;hould become the Prey of <HI>Worms,</HI> when they are returning to their Original Du&s;t, might be &s;ubmitted to without Regret; but to be &s;eiz'd on before that time, and even
<PB N="4" REF="3">upon our very Entrance on Life, that In|fant Innocence &s;hould &s;u&s;tain the Fate of the Profane <HI>Prometheus,</HI> in having their tender Bowels corroded by the&s;e Inte&s;tine Vultures, is a Condition exceedingly deplorable, and yet &s;o very frequent, that 'tis almo&s;t always &s;u&s;pected in Children on every Di&s;order, and not unju&s;tly; &s;ince, as <HI>Platerus</HI> ob&s;erves, few Per&s;ons are free from <HI>Worms;</HI> and Ex|perience verifies the Ob&s;ervation in the Di&s;|&s;ection of Dead Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> has a&s;&s;ur'd us, That unborn Infants are invaded by them; and <HI>Dolaeus</HI> in Di&s;&s;ecting an Infant, which dy'd as &s;oon as born, tells us, he found a Clu&s;ter of <HI>Worms</HI> in its Bowels.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians and Philo&s;ophers of former Ages, had a very &s;hort and ea&s;y Way of Accounting for the Generation of In&s;ects, by &s;uppo&s;ing them bred of them&s;elves, out of &s;ome putrefying Matter, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heat or Motion.</P>
<P>But this Account is now ju&s;tly rejected, as extreamly Ab&s;urd and Unrea&s;onable, by tho&s;e, who have been the lea&s;t acquainted with the great and &s;urprizing Di&s;coveries of the Modern Philo&s;ophers; who, by the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Micro&s;copes (an Advantage un|known
<PB N="5" REF="4">to former Ages) have found, that the minute&s;t In&s;ects are furni&s;h'd with all the Parts that are nece&s;&s;ary, not only for Life, but al&s;o for the Propagation of their &s;everal Kinds, as perfect as in larger Ani|mals; and con&s;equently, are not produc'd at Random; but are the regular Off-&s;pring of Parents of the &s;ame Kind, no le&s;s than others.</P>
<P>It's ob&s;ervable, that Nature's wi&s;e Au|thor has given &s;uch a Propen&s;ion to tho&s;e Creatures, who cannot bring up their Pro|geny, to lay their Eggs in Places proper to breed them. Thus Flies commonly drop theirs in <HI>dead Bodies, Pustles, &V;lcers,</HI> &amp;c. becau&s;e in &s;uch tender Parts their Eggs may lie ea&s;y, and find Warmth &s;ufficient to hatch them; and afterwards, Humidity and Food for the Nouri&s;hment of the Animal. An In&s;tance of this is related by Mr. <HI>de la Cro&s;s,</HI> in his <HI>Memoirs, p.</HI> 229.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dutch</HI> Woman had her Leg &s;woln and glandulous, about a Span from the Knee; the Chyrurgion, who had it in Cure, to know the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, took off this glandulous Body to the Bigne&s;s of a Nail, wa&s;h'd it in Brandy, cut it, and per|ceiv'd therein a great many little <HI>Worms;</HI> whereupon, having con&s;ulted Mr. <HI>Leeuwen|hoeck,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">he affirm'd, they were come from the Eggs, which a Fly had lain in the mor|tify'd Part, as he prov'd in the following Manner; He put the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> into a Box, with a Piece of raw Beef, which was &s;oon con&s;um'd by them, as well as the glandu|lous Body, wherein they were hatch'd; He fed them three &s;everal times, and five Days after, <HI>viz. July</HI> 31, he found his Box empty; but having look'd carefully about the Room, he recover'd &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> that would eat no more, and were already grown to the length of ones Nail: He put them on a Paper, cover'd with a large Gla&s;s; and the next Day, in the Morning, he ob|&s;erv'd one of the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> &s;hortned, but encreas'd a third Part in Bulk, &s;o that it had &s;omething of the &s;hape of a Tun: In the Evening, he perceiv'd four others in the &s;ame Po&s;ture, which from White became Red.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 11. The Cods of the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> were all black, he open'd one of them, whence he took out a perfect Fly, that was yet wet and motionle&s;s: He ob&s;erv'd, that be&s;ides the Cod, this In&s;ect was wrap'd up in a very thin Membrane. He open'd this un|timely Fly, and found a great quantity of Eggs in its Body.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 15. All the Flies inclos'd in the Gla&s;s were hatch'd, and at the &s;ame time he per|ceiv'd other Flies again&s;t the Gla&s;s-Windows of his Chamber, which he had &s;uppos'd to have come from tho&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> which he had not retriev'd. In feeding the&s;e Infects, mo&s;t part dy'd, or fled away: So that, <HI>Sept.</HI> 7. he had but Two left, that were probably Male and Female, for they laid 145 Eggs; &s;ome of which he caus'd to be hatch'd in le&s;s than 24 Hours, by carrying them in his Pocket, &s;hut up in a Box.</P>
<P>The Learn'd <HI>Baglivi,</HI> Phy&s;ician at <HI>Rome,</HI> in a Letter to Mr. <HI>Andry</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> writes thus concerning the Breeding of <HI>Worms.</HI> The Beginning and Original of all Animals and Vegetables is from an Egg; for what el&s;e are the Seeds of Plants but Eggs, in which all the Rudiments of the future Plant are contracted, as it were, into a &s;hort Compen|dium? And tho&s;e, by Virtue of the Fermen|tation of the Nutritive Juice, by the Ela|&s;tick Power of the Air, and the double Warmth, one of the Sun, and the other of the central Warmth of the Earth, the great Mother of all, are uncover'd by little and little; and their Fetters being as it were loos'd, they grow, and arrive in due time to &s;uch a Bulk, as great as is allotted to every &s;ort of Plant by the Laws of Nature.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>If all Philo&s;ophers and Phy&s;icians think thus concerning Vegetables, much more mu&s;t they think &s;o of living Creatures, not only of tho&s;e that are call'd Perfect, but of the Imperfect al&s;o, which are commonly call'd In&s;ects. For be&s;ides, that there is the &s;ame equal Order in all Things, and that all come from one Principle, and after a cer|tain general Circuit, end all in one again; In&s;ects, by an admirable Connexion and Con&s;truction of Parts, and by a more no|ble Exerci&s;e of vital Operations, do not only, in no wi&s;e, give place to Plants, but far excel them.</P>
<P>Wherefore, &s;ince no Man &s;ays that Plants ri&s;e from Putrefaction, they ought not in Rea&s;on to deduce the Original of In&s;ects, and other ba&s;er Animals from thence. For 'tis a &s;hame to Philo&s;ophers and Phy&s;icians, in this mo&s;t happy Age of Sciences, where|in the Cau&s;es of Things are illu&s;trated by Experiments, and &s;olid Precepts of the Ma|thematicks, to a&s;cribe to the fortuitous Chance of Putrefaction, that which the con|&s;tant and perpetual Law of Nature, remain|ing in its Seeds, rules and directs.</P>
<P>For 'tis not Putrefaction that produces im|perfect living Creatures, but the Heat and Fermentation of the Things putrefying, that
<PB N="9" REF="8">makes fruitful the Seeds of Things &s;pread all over the World, if I may be allow'd &s;o to &s;peak; or rather, it &s;tirs up, and revives the imperceptible Parts of the future living Creature in the Egg; and, as it were, in|&s;pires 'em with the fir&s;t Life, in the &s;ame manner with the Heat of the Sun, or that of brooding Hens.</P>
<P>What we have &s;aid of In&s;ects in gene|ral, may be aptly apply'd to the <HI>Worms</HI> bred in Human Bodies, &s;eeing they are not generated by putrefying Humours; but the Worms Eggs lying hid in the Inte&s;tines, are enliven'd, and brought forth by the &s;ame Means.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the &s;everal Kinds of <HI>Worms</HI> bred in Human Bodies.</HEAD>
<P>THESE pernicious Animals differ greatly, not only among them&s;elves, as to Shape, and other Circum&s;tances; but al&s;o in re&s;pect of the &s;everal Parts of the
<PB N="10" REF="9">Body they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and whence they receive their Denomination.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Cephalick</HI> breed in the Head, where they occa&s;ion violent Pains, Di&s;tra|ctions, and &s;ometimes contagious Di&s;tem|pers; <HI>Sennertus</HI> mentions a Per&s;on afflicted with an Head-Ach violent to Di&s;traction; when after &s;even Days Continuance, and the Patient almo&s;t dead with the Pain, a <HI>Worm</HI> came out of his right No&s;tril, above a Span long, after which he &s;oon recover'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Andry</HI> &s;ays, he knew a Man, who being cur'd of a <HI>Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> complain'd afterwards of an un&s;ufferable Pain in his Head; for which his Skull was trepan'd, and a little &s;hort <HI>Worm</HI> was found upon the <HI>Dura-mater;</HI> which being taken out, the Pa|tient recover'd a per&s;ect Health.</P>
<P>Such another Ca&s;e is related by <HI>Fore&s;tus,</HI> only the <HI>Worm</HI> he &s;peaks of was Black.</P>
<P><HI>Hild-&s;heim</HI> tells of a Per&s;on, who voided Thirteen long <HI>Worms</HI> alive, and Woolly like a <HI>Caterpiller</HI> from his No&s;trils, Ears and Mouth.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gemma</HI> reports of a Matron dying of a Pe&s;tilential Fever, who&s;e Head being open'd,
<PB N="11" REF="10">there appear'd abundance of <HI>Worms,</HI> both in the Sub&s;tance of the Brain, and between the Coverings, and al&s;o Swarms of In&s;ects like <HI>Bugs.</HI></P>
<P>But the Account which <HI>F. Angelinus</HI> &s;ent his Friend is wonderful, concerning a Per&s;on who had an Epidemical Fever, and was re&s;tle&s;s eight Nights; when, upon his Re|covery, he was troubled with an Itching in his right No&s;tril; and &s;oon after there came out of it a <HI>Worm</HI> as long as ones little Fin|ger, its Body thick and red, its Head black and hard, with two &s;harp Arms like tho&s;e of a <HI>Scorpion;</HI> &s;ix Feet towards the Head, and &s;ome &s;mall ones towards the Tail, on which it walk'd very briskly; it liv'd four Days without Food.</P>
<P><HI>Kerckingius</HI> in his Anatomical Ob&s;ervations, gives us the Figure of an Hairy horn'd <HI>Worm,</HI> which came out of the No&s;tril of a Woman at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> on the 21&s;t of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1688. which he kept alive 'till the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> without giving it any Food: And which is very Remarkable, it brought forth another <HI>Worm</HI> before it dy'd.</P>
<P>A Pe&s;tilential Fever rag'd at <HI>Beneventum,</HI> and &s;wept off abundance of People; at length the Phy&s;icians opening the Head of one that
<PB N="12" REF="11">dy'd of it, found a little live <HI>Worm</HI> very &s;hort, and all over red; and having try'd &s;everal Things to kill it, found nothing ef|fectual but the Decoction of <HI>Radi&s;hes</HI> in <HI>Malm&s;ey</HI> Wine, which was no &s;ooner pour'd on the <HI>Worm</HI> but it dy'd; after which they admini&s;tred the &s;ame Remedy to all their Patients, and almo&s;t all recover'd.</P>
<P><HI>Schenckius</HI> al&s;o relates, That in the Year 1571. and Epidemical Fever rag'd in <HI>Ancona,</HI> which caus'd a furious Giddine&s;s, and Death on the third or fourth Day. All the Phy&s;i|cians of the Place confe&s;s'd they did not under&s;tand the Di&s;ea&s;e, and con&s;equently knew not how to cure it. A rich young Man finding a Periodical Pain beginning in his Head, became apprehen&s;ive of being &s;eiz'd with the Di&s;temper; and being fright|ed by the ingenuous Acknowledgment of the Phy&s;icians, left the Country, and went to <HI>Venice;</HI> where calling for a Con&s;ultation of the mo&s;t Learned Phy&s;icians, one of them a&s;&s;erted, that a <HI>Worm</HI> in the Brain was the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e Periodical Pains, which were &s;o violent in the Paroxy&s;m, without di&s;turbing his Rea&s;on or Memory, that it &s;eem'd as if his Head had been bored with an Iron.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>They admini&s;tred &s;everal Things without Effect, &s;o that he dy'd in three Days time after his Arrival. They open'd his Head, and found on the Right &s;ide, under the <HI>Pia|mater</HI> the Head of a <HI>Worm,</HI> which by Rea|&s;on of the cold Air, immediately retir'd in|to the Sub&s;tance of the Brain. They then cut open the Ventricles of the Brain, and trac'd out the <HI>Worm,</HI> which was all over Red, as long as one's Fore-finger; the Head black and pointed, and the Neck Hairy.</P>
<P><HI>Amatus Lu&s;it.</HI> took a <HI>Worm</HI> out of the in|ner Corner of a Girl's Eye; 'twas half a Span long, white, and alive when taken out.</P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>Worms</HI> are found in the Ear, as in a Girl of Ten Years old, who was afflicted with the Evil, and had a violent Pain in the Right Ear, which &s;uppurated from time to time, and &s;ometimes &s;he be|came Deaf. Mr. <HI>Andry,</HI> after a fruitle&s;s Ap|plication of &s;everal Remedies, &s;u&s;pected <HI>Worms,</HI> and apply'd an Ointment for that Purpo&s;e; whereupon abundance of &s;mall <HI>Worms</HI> came forth, they were yellow, long, and very &s;lender.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P><HI>Kerkingius</HI> gives an Account of five <HI>Worms,</HI> which came from a Man's Ear in the Year 1663. very much like Hog-Lice.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Worms</HI> which breed under a Cru&s;t, that covers the &s;urface of the Teeth. They are very &s;mall, and have a round Head, mark'd with a black Point, the other Part of their Body being long and &s;lender. The&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> corrode the Teeth by degrees, and occa&s;ion a Stink, but no violent Pain. They are call'd <HI>Dentarii.</HI></P>
<P>Even the Liver has been ob&s;erv'd to en|tertain the&s;e In&s;ects, &s;o <HI>Ca&s;per Bauhinus</HI> re|lates, That in <HI>October</HI> 1578. &s;everal &s;mall <HI>Worms</HI> were found in the Liver of a Child of two Years of Age, that dy'd of the <HI>Small-Pox:</HI> They were red, round, &s;ome|what long and &s;oft; it &s;eem'd &s;trange to &s;everal Phy&s;icians, who were pre&s;ent at the opening: But it may be con&s;ider'd, that there may be &s;everal Accidents, wherein the Gall in the Liver may be &s;o much al|ter'd, as to lo&s;e very much of its Bitter|ne&s;s, and thereby permit the Ingendring of <HI>Worms.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ometimes breed in the Heart, oc|ca&s;ioning violent Pains, Swoonings and &s;ud|den
<PB N="15" REF="14">Death. Thus <HI>Sphererius</HI> writes, That a <HI>Florentine</HI> Gentleman di&s;cour&s;ing one Day with a Stranger, in the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;|cany</HI>'s Court, drop'd down dead, on a &s;ud|den; and his Body being open'd on Su&s;pi|cion of Poi&s;on, a live <HI>Worm</HI> was found in the Heart.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pleuri&s;y</HI> has been often ob&s;erv'd to be occa&s;ion'd by <HI>Worms. Gabucinus</HI> vi&s;ited a Maid, &s;eiz'd with a <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> and ob&s;erving her cold and hot reciprocally, and in her hot Fits one of her Cheeks very red, the other continuing pale, &s;u&s;pecting <HI>Worms,</HI> he pre|&s;crib'd her a Medicine for that purpo&s;e, which, brought away a great Number of <HI>Worms,</HI> and thereupon the <HI>Pleuri&s;y</HI> left her.</P>
<P>Several ancient Men, as <HI>Quercitan</HI> te&s;tifies, defunct, of <HI>Pleuri&s;ies,</HI> had their Inte&s;tines full of large <HI>Worms,</HI> which he concluded the Cau&s;e of that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lo&s;s,</HI> in his <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> relates &s;uch a Ca&s;e of a Youth about Fourteen Years of Age, of a thin and bilious Con&s;titution, who in a very &s;harp Winter, having got|ten Cold, was &s;eiz'd with a true <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> attended with a continual Fever; a prick|ing Pain in his le&s;t Brea&s;t, reaching to his
<PB N="16" REF="15">Throat, a difficulty in Breathing, a violent Cough, and Spitting of Blood; his Body was by Intervals cold and hot, with a Red|ne&s;s in his Cheeks, and a great Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s. About the fifth Day of the Di&s;ea&s;e, being Co&s;tive, a Gli&s;ter of Milk was injected, which brought away five <HI>Worms,</HI> which were <HI>Teretes;</HI> wherefore with &s;ome Alte|ration of the Medicines, which were before pre&s;crib'd, the following Powder was ex|hibited.</P>
<P><HI>&amp; Scord. card. ben. a</HI> &scruple; <HI>j Corallin.</HI> &scruple; <HI>ij C.C.C.</HI> &dram; <HI>j Rhabarb.</HI> &scruple; 4 <HI>Sal Centuar.</HI> &scruple; <HI>j</HI> Do&s;e &dram; <HI>&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>After which <HI>Worms</HI> came away daily, in all above Thirty, and he recover'd.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Andry</HI> had &s;o remarkable a Ca&s;e of this &s;ort, that it put him upon Writing an en|tire Book on the Subject of <HI>Worms.</HI> The Ca&s;e was this, On the 4th of <HI>June,</HI> 1698. a young Man, about Thirty Years of Age, was &s;eiz'd with a Fever, great Pain in his Side, Spitting of Blood, and Difficulty of Breathing. He began the Cure by Opening a Vein, and repeated the &s;ame the next Day, on the 3d he &s;weated, on the 4th he &s;eem'd to be much better; but from thence to the 5th he had a <HI>Delirium,</HI> which went off the next Morning. The <HI>Delirium</HI> not being
<PB N="17" REF="16">preceded by the u&s;ual Signs, occa&s;ion'd a Su&s;picion of <HI>Worms,</HI> and finding withal a great many in his Excrements by Stool, he pre&s;crib'd a purging Medicine the next Morning (which has been very &s;ucce&s;sful in that Ca&s;e) an Hour after the taking it, the Patient found &s;omething &s;tir in his Bo|dy, which Motion continu'd two Hours, and determin'd in the I&s;&s;uing forth of a live <HI>Worm,</HI> or rather Link of <HI>Worms,</HI> four Ells three Inches in Length, being the <HI>Cu|curbitini,</HI> which are particularly de&s;crib'd, <HI>p.</HI> 34.</P>
<P>Sometimes we meet with 'em in the Blood, where they ob&s;truct the Orifice in Bleeding; &s;o a Chirurgion at <HI>Paris,</HI> whil&s;t he was Bleeding a Patient, found the Blood &s;top on a &s;udden; and turning up the Arm to find the Cau&s;e, he &s;aw an horned <HI>Worm</HI> as long as an <HI>Earwig,</HI> which bur&s;t out with Violence along with the Blood.</P>
<P>Such another Accident is related by Mr. <HI>de la Cro&s;e,</HI> in his <HI>Memoirs,</HI> of Mr. <HI>du Puy,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;ician; who being pre&s;ent at the Bleeding of a Lady, his Patient, the Blood, after it had &s;prung out above two Ounces, &s;top'd on a &s;udden; and as he was looking for the Cau&s;e of it, he per|ceiv'd an <HI>Heterogeneous</HI> Body that &s;top'd
<PB N="18" REF="17">the Orifice; whereupon taking the Chirur|gion's Forceps, he drew out a <HI>Worm</HI> as big as could come out of the Inci&s;ion.</P>
<P>He accounts for its coming there in the following Manner: The Egg of &s;ome fly|ing In&s;ect had been &s;wallow'd by the Pa|tient in her Food, and being de&s;cended in|to the &s;mall Guts, went with the Chile into the Milky Veins, through all the Pores of the filtrating Glandules, the Heart, Lungs, Aorta, 'till arriving at la&s;t to the Extremities or the Fingers, it remain'd there among their &s;mall Arteries and Veins, and was hatch'd out by the mo&s;t conve|nient and natural Heat of the Blood and Fle&s;h. Having thus gotten the Life and Motion of a <HI>Worm,</HI> it &s;wam for greater Ea&s;e and Room into the Arm; and follow|ing &s;till the cheri&s;hing Liquor, wherein it was bred, it came at length to the Inci|&s;ion of the Vein, whence Mr. <HI>du Pay</HI> ex|tracted it.</P>
<P>They have been often &s;een in the Urine, and of various Kinds; &s;ome like Hog-Lice, others like Mites in Chee&s;e, &s;ome like Leeches, others like Gra&s;s-Hoppers; of which la&s;t &s;ort was that voided by Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> when he lay ill of a continual Fever.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P><HI>Vidius</HI> writes of one, who after tedious Pains in the Kidnies, di&s;charg'd a &s;mall <HI>Worm</HI> by Urine; its Head was &s;harp and horned, its Back and Belly broad, and cover'd with an hard Shell like a <HI>Tortoi&s;e,</HI> its Colour black, but reddi&s;h on the Bel|ly.</P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Turberville,</HI> in the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;.

<P>In the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;.</HI> there is an Account of one Mr. <HI>Thomas Dent,</HI> who being af|flicted
<PB N="20" REF="19">with <HI>Tumours</HI> on his Tongue, ap|ply'd him&s;elf to one Mrs. <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter;</HI> who (in the Pre&s;ence of Two Al|dermen of that Town, Mr. <HI>Gibbs,</HI> Chap|lain to the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and others) pierc'd the Parts tumify'd with a Lancet, and drew &s;ome Blood; and &s;oon after with a &s;mall <HI>Spatula,</HI> and another In&s;trument, wherewith &s;he open'd the Orifices, &s;he pick'd out five or &s;ix <HI>Worms</HI> at a time. She plainly &s;hew'd them to the Spectators, as they came out of the Fle&s;h; they were all alive, and mov'd their Heads, some|what le&s;&s;er than ordinary <HI>Maggots:</HI> In le&s;s than eight Days &s;he took out of the Tongue more than an hundred <HI>Worms,</HI> almo&s;t all of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s, except two very large ones, which &s;he &s;aid were of a Cancerous Production. She took more than Thirty out of the Gums, which la&s;t Operation was her ordinary Practice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>de la Cro&s;e</HI> in his <HI>Memoirs, p.</HI> 223. gives an Account of one <HI>Sarah Ha&s;tings,</HI> who follow'd the &s;ame Practice at <HI>Holm,</HI> in <HI>Huntingdon-&s;hire;</HI> and had attain'd to &s;o great Skill, as to di&s;cern at fir&s;t Sight, whether any Per&s;on had <HI>Worms</HI> great or &s;mall in his Gums, Tongue or Face: The&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> &s;he affirm'd to be the Cau&s;e of Rot|tenne&s;s of the Teeth, of <HI>Pustules,</HI> and ma|ny
<PB N="21" REF="20">other Putrefactions; &s;he drew them out of any Part in three or four Minutes, with a Goo&s;e-Quill, cut like a Pen; &s;he pierc'd the Part &s;o Dexterou&s;ly, that the Pain was almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible; then &s;he threw the extracted <HI>Worms</HI> into a Gla&s;s of clean Water, where they appeared to have a round and red Head, the re&s;t of the Body being white. He there relates &s;everal ex|traordinary Cures of that Sort, too large to in&s;ert here.</P>
<P>But of all the Parts, the Stomach and Guts are the mo&s;t u&s;ually infe&s;ted with <HI>Worms,</HI> e&s;pecially in Children: However, before we enter upon a particular De&s;crip|tion of tho&s;e, which properly belong to the&s;e Parts, it may be convenient to en|tertain the Reader with &s;ome Hi&s;tories of very &s;trange Animals, excluded the Sto|mach by Vomiting. The Accounts are taken out of the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;actions.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t is Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI>'s, of a Baker at <HI>York,</HI> who in <HI>March</HI> 1681/2. vomited up a <HI>Worm</HI> of a very &s;trange Figure; I found it (<HI>&s;ays the Doctor</HI>) in the Blood, which came up with it; having caus'd it to be wa&s;h'd, for the more careful Examination of it; much of the Blood being Clods of a kind of skinny and fle&s;hy Sub&s;tance. Of
<PB N="22" REF="21">this kind of Blood there was about two Pounds &s;av'd in the Wa&s;hing, and this odd Animal among&s;t it: It was of a dark, green Colour, like an Hor&s;e-Leech, and &s;potted, not unlike &s;ome of them. I could not perceive, when I found it, any Life or Motion in it. The Girl, who wa&s;h'd it, had beaten off almo&s;t a Fin, and part of one of the Forks of the Tail, and bur&s;t its Belly; yet it was regularly and curi|ou&s;ly &s;hap'd in all its Members. The Man imagin'd he drank it the Summer before in Pond-Water, whereof he was us'd to drink after &s;ore Labour in his Cal|ling. This is certain, he had about his Stomach, and right Side, a mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite and tormenting Pain for at lea&s;t four Months, which many times threw him into Horrors and Chilne&s;s, Ague like; and indeed, when he vomited this up, he was the &s;icke&s;t Man I ever &s;aw, not to die: He al&s;o voided Blood by Stool &s;everal Days.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s where to place this Ani|mal, it not being like any thing I ever &s;aw in Nature. It was about four Inches long, and in the thicke&s;t Part three Inches about; it had three Fins on a &s;ide, all near the Head, and all of them were thick and fle&s;hy; but the forked Tail was finny and
<PB N="23" REF="22">tran&s;parent, and to be extended. It was plac'd Horrizantally, not as that of mo&s;t (if not all) &s;mall Fi&s;h; and even <HI>Newts</HI> and <HI>Tadpoles,</HI> or <HI>Frogs</HI> in Di&s;gui&s;e, in which Particular it differs from all, as well as in the Fle&s;hine&s;s of the Fins.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this odd Animal, I found the Head of another of a different Shape; but the like dark green Colour.</P>
<P>I'm apt to think, we often eat and drink what is alive; and 'tis certain, &s;ome Things will live on in our Stomachs in &s;pight of Concoction, as <HI>Gut-Worms</HI> bred in us, and perhaps in &s;ome Children be|fore they are born. And yet I am of the Mind, that what was accidentally &s;wal|low'd by us alive, and that &s;hall have the Power to live on within us (e&s;pecially if it be young and tender) and yet growing, may have its Shape and de&s;ign'd Form &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly perverted, as to appear to us quite another Thing than naturally it is; and this I take to be the Ca&s;e of this odd Creature, which might have been the Spawn, or Embrio of a <HI>Toad</HI> or <HI>Newt.</HI></P>
<P>The skinny Lumps of Blood vomited up with it, I think, may be ea&s;ily accounted, for. For this Spawn, or Embrio of a <HI>Toad</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="23">or <HI>Newt,</HI> might well envenom the Sto|mach or Gut, in which Part or Wrinckle &s;oever it chanc'd to re&s;t or &s;tick fir&s;t, and cau&s;e an Inflamation there, and have it &s;well'd or clos'd up within a Tumour of its own making; which in Proce&s;s of Time might gather to this Bigne&s;s, and at length bur&s;ting in Pieces, come up toge|ther.</P>
<P>Familiar In&s;tances of this Nature we &s;ee in Fruits or Wens, which In&s;ects rai&s;e upon Vegetables; who by natural In&s;tinct know how to envenom a Plant, and com|pendiou&s;ly provide both Food and Hou&s;ing for their Young. <HI>So far Dr.</HI> Li&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next is, <HI>No.</HI> 117. <HI>p.</HI> 395. Of a Girl at <HI>Sheffield,</HI> about eight Months old, who was &s;eiz'd with violent Fits of Vomiting, which held her about a Week; and Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> being &s;ent for, and happening to &s;ay, that <HI>Wormwood</HI> was good for the Stomach, whil&s;t he was gone to fetch &s;ome Things proper for that Occa&s;ion, they in the mean Time offer'd the Child &s;ome <HI>Wormwood</HI> Ale, which &s;he took &s;o greedily, that &s;he &s;wal|low'd down a Pint of it; and at his Re|turn, &s;he vomited up in his Pre&s;ence three <HI>Hexapodes</HI> (i. e. <HI>Worms</HI> with &s;ix Feet) all very active and nimble; and the Child
<PB N="25" REF="24">&s;oon recover'd. Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> carry'd them the &s;ame Day to Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op</HI> (who &s;ent the Account) they kill'd one of them in try|ing Experiments upon it, but gave each of the other Two, the Head of a &s;hining <HI>A|tricapella</HI> (a Bird with black Feathers on its Head) which in about five Week's Time they eat up, Bones, Feathers and all, except the Extremities of the Feathers and Beaks. Then they gave them a Piece of <HI>Larus</HI> (a <HI>Sea-Cob</HI>) but that it &s;eems did not agree &s;o well with them, for they dy'd within two Days after.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Account is Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI>'s, the Son of one not far from <HI>Rippon,</HI> about 9 Years of Age, in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1674. was afflicted with a great Pain in his Stomach, and continual Vomitings; a Powder was given him, wherein was a &s;mall Quantity of <HI>Mercurius Dulcis;</HI> he thereupon vomited up &s;everal &s;trange <HI>Worms,</HI> two of which were brought the Doctor at <HI>York,</HI> one dead, the other alive, 'till he put it into Spirit of Wine, to pre&s;erve it in its true Shape. The&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> were very <HI>Caterpillers,</HI> with fourteen Legs, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ix &s;mall pointed, the eight middle Stumps, and the two hind ones Cla&s;pers. They were &s;omething more than an Inch long, of the thickne&s;s of a Duck's-Quill, thin hair'd, or rather naked, with
<PB N="26" REF="25">brown <HI>Annuli,</HI> and black Heads; the &s;ame for kind, that is often &s;een on Plants. The&s;e, no doubt, would in due time, if the Place had not hindred, have &s;hrunk into <HI>Chry&s;alis's,</HI> and chang'd into <HI>Moths;</HI> as al&s;o tho&s;e mention'd by Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op,</HI> in the preceeding Hi&s;tory, would have chang'd into <HI>Beetles.</HI></P>
<P>The proper Inhabitants of the&s;e dark Regions, are of four Sorts; <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Teres,</HI> the <HI>Cucurbitini,</HI> the <HI>Taenia,</HI> and the <HI>A&s;carides.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Of the <HI>Teres,</HI> or common long and round <HI>Worm,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ty&s;on</HI> has given a very curious Anatomical De&s;cription in the <HI>Phi|lo&s;. Tran&s;. No.</HI> 147. <HI>p.</HI> 154. from whence I &s;hall borrow a few Ob&s;ervations. Tho' we are gravell'd <HI>(&s;ays the Doctor)</HI> in A&s;&s;ign|ing how the&s;e Sorts of <HI>Worms</HI> &s;hould come fir&s;t into the Body; yet being once there, nothing is more plain, than that they are propagated by an univocal Generation; there being in this Sort, &s;o perfect a Di|&s;tinction or Sexes, Male and Female; and the Organs of each &s;o curiou&s;ly contriv'd, &s;o con&s;picuous and plain, as &s;hew how &s;o|licitous Nature is in pre&s;erving, and propa|gating the meane&s;t Species.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<P>This <HI>Worm,</HI> which Children are u&s;ually troubled with, is u&s;ually a Foot long, the Male generally le&s;s than the Female; its thickne&s;s about that of a Wheat Straw, or Goo&s;e-Quill, at both Extreams, they grow narrow, the Mouth con&s;i&s;ts of three Lips, the <HI>Anus</HI> of a tran&s;ver&s;e Slit, a little before the extream Point of the Tail.</P>
<P>In Cutting thro' the Mu&s;cles under the Skin, there i&s;&s;u'd out a copious <HI>Ichor,</HI> which is naturally di&s;charg'd by &s;ome Pores in the Skin, and makes a Covering to the Body, which is often ca&s;t off, and ob&s;erv'd as a mucous Matter in the Stools of tho&s;e, who are troubled with them.</P>
<P>In Opening the <HI>Cornua &V;teri</HI> of the Fe|male <HI>Worm,</HI> they were found turgid with a Milky Juice, a little of which being plac'd on a &s;mall <HI>Micro&s;cope,</HI> was found to be nothing el&s;e but an infinite Number of Eggs, tho' to the naked Eye, it appear'd only as a fluid Body.</P>
<P>By Comparing that &s;mall Quantity, I did ob&s;erve, and in which I could di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o many Eggs, with the whole Quantity contain'd, in both the <HI>Cornua,</HI> I cannot gue&s;s there could be fewer than Ten Thou|&s;and
<PB N="28" REF="27">in each Female <HI>Worm,</HI> which &s;uffici|ently accounts for that prodigious Number of <HI>Worms,</HI> &s;ometimes ob&s;erv'd to be bred in Animal Bodies; and were it not that the greate&s;t Part of the Litter of this <HI>Worm</HI> is u&s;ually carry'd forth by the <HI>Faeces,</HI> it could not be avoided, but we &s;hould be de|vour'd by &s;uch a multiparous Enemy, bred in our own Bowels; of who&s;e pernicious Effects, &s;ome of the following In&s;tances are fatal Proofs.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> in the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;. p.</HI> 326. <HI>No.</HI> 224. relates, That in Di&s;&s;ecting a Boy of Nine Years of Age, who dy'd &s;uddenly, being &s;eiz'd with a Fit of Vomiting; be|&s;ides, a great many other Di&s;orders of all the Bowels, they found a <HI>Worm</HI> in the Sto|mach about nine Inches long, and a Line and a half broad.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>James Burrows</HI> reports, in the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;. No.</HI> 264. <HI>p.</HI> 598. That in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June</HI> 1700. a Labouring Man of middle Age at <HI>Stanton,</HI> &s;even Miles from <HI>Bury,</HI> had for many Days together &s;o inordinate an Appetite, that he eat up an ordinary Leg of Veal roa&s;ted at a Meal. He would eat Sow-Thi&s;tles, and divers other Herbs, as greedily, during the time his <HI>Bulimia</HI> la&s;ted, as the Bea&s;ts that u&s;e &s;uch Food;
<PB N="29" REF="28">and all he could get was little enough to &s;atisfy his Hunger, 'till at length he voided divers <HI>Worms,</HI> as long, and as big about as a Tobacco-Pipe; after which, his Ap|petite declin'd by degrees, 'till it came to the common Rate of others.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o an Account, in the &s;ame Place, of a Di&s;&s;ection perform'd by the <HI>Sieur Soye,</HI> in an Ho&s;pital, on the Body of a Servant Maid, about twenty &s;ix Years of Age, who was from time to time &s;eiz'd with a <HI>Bloody-Flux.</HI> He found the <HI>Colon,</HI> and part of the <HI>Me&s;entery</HI> ulcerated, the Mouth of which <HI>&V;lcer</HI> was &s;o large, that one might ea&s;ily thru&s;t in his Fi&s;t at it, and 'twas &s;top'd with a Clew of <HI>Worms</HI> greater than it.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lo&s;s,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> writes, That the Son of Sir <HI>Lewis Dive,</HI> a Child of a good Con&s;titution of Body, af|ter an Indi&s;po&s;ition of two or three Days, attended with a dry Cough, and a re&s;tle&s;s Condition, e&s;pecially in the Night, with continual Cryings, was at length &s;eiz'd with violent and continual <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> whereof in three Days he dy'd. In cut|ting open the Body to di&s;cover the Cau&s;e, they were &s;oon &s;atisfy'd, when they found the <HI>Duodenum</HI> quite eaten thro' by a <HI>Teres,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="29">or long <HI>Worm,</HI> which was taken out a|live.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Fevers</HI> tells us, He knew one in an acute <HI>Fever,</HI> who was mole&s;ted with continual Swoonings, 'till he vomited up a long round <HI>Worm;</HI> and there|upon his Swoonings left him.</P>
<P>Examples of this Kind are very nume|rous, and 'tis no wonder to meet with this Species in their proper Soil; but the Ac|count which Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> has publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;.</HI> is very &s;urprizing; <HI>viz.</HI> In <HI>April</HI> 1673. a Chyrurgion at <HI>York</HI> brought him about twenty <HI>Worms,</HI> which he had ju&s;t taken out of an ulcerated Ancle of a Girl about eight Years of Age; &s;he had been in great Mi&s;ery &s;ome Months, and had been &s;ent up to <HI>London,</HI> where &s;he was touch'd and dre&s;s'd for the <HI>Evil;</HI> &s;ome|time after her Return, her Pain continu|ing, a young Puppy was open'd, and ap|ply'd to the Sore. The Chyrurgion, who took off the Puppy, found it to his great Surprize full of <HI>Worms,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;ixty in Number, of the Species of the <HI>Teretes,</HI> which Children familiarly void from the Guts. They were between three and four Inches long, all about an equal Bigne&s;s, as of one Brood, &s;omething thicker than a <HI>Duck's</HI>-Quill,
<PB N="31" REF="30">very &s;harp at both Ends; &s;tiff, and exactly round, and yet could move, and twi&s;t them&s;elves vi&s;ibly enough. The Leg was &s;ound, all but the Ancle, which was va&s;tly &s;well'd, and the Girl otherwi&s;e hear|ty, and well colour'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Taenia,</HI> or Tape <HI>Worm,</HI> &s;o call'd from its Re&s;emblance to a Tape or Rib|bon, is broad and flat, and white; its Thinne&s;s renders it diaphanous, its Length is very uncertain, becau&s;e its Sub&s;tance be|ing very &s;oft and tender; it u&s;ually breaks off when it comes away, &s;o that 'tis very rare to find it entire; the whole is proba|bly the Length of all the Bowels, that is, &s;even times the Length of the Man; but lying very much folded together, takes up but little Room; it u&s;ually comes away Piece-meal, &s;even or eight Foot long, &s;ome|times nineteen, twenty three, thirty; forty five Foot of it has been found broke off at a time; it grows gradually &s;maller towards the Tail, which terminates in a very &s;mall and long Part like an Hair; in its wide&s;t Part, its Breadth is about that of one's Fore|finger.</P>
<P><HI>Spigelius</HI> tells us of a Woman, who void|ed at &s;everal times &s;everal Pieces of this <HI>Wormy,</HI> whereof two were extraordinary
<PB N="32" REF="31">long. The fir&s;t that came away, was two Yards and a half long, containing the Tail Part of the <HI>Worm,</HI> but wanting the ex|tream Part of the Tail, perhaps unknow|ingly broke off by the Patient before, part of it hanging out of the <HI>Anus;</HI> her Si&s;ter drew it forth &s;o far, but tir'd with its pro|digious Length, &s;he broke it off with her Nails; this Piece, in that Part where it was fre&s;h broke off, was as broad as ones little Finger, and became narrower gradu|ally as it approach'd the Tail; its Sub|&s;tance was &s;oft, throughout white, blood|le&s;s like a Membrane of the Guts. Ano|ther Piece that came away about a Year after, was eight Foot long, and the breadth of ones Middle-Finger; the Joints were larger and thicker, the Inci&s;ures wider, and the Sides more jagged.</P>
<P><HI>Fabricius</HI> gives a De&s;cription of the like Sort of <HI>Worm,</HI> which a Woman of twenty Years of Age voided, upon taking a Purg|ing Medicine, which was twenty Spans long; one of the Extreams was as &s;lender as a Thread, the other broad.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Author relates the following Hi&s;tory.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="32">
<P>A Lady at <HI>Lau&s;anne,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> very &s;ubject in her Youth to Palpitations of the Heart; and after a &s;ort of Purge &s;he us'd to take, &s;he voided &s;ometimes very long Pieces of <HI>Worms.</HI> After &s;he was marry'd, and began to have Children, her Palpita|tions left her, only &s;he was troubled with a <HI>Lienteria;</HI> during which, &s;he voided down|wards &s;everal Pieces of <HI>Worms;</HI> &s;ome &s;ix, &s;ome nine, others ten Spans long. Every time &s;he voided the&s;e Pieces, &s;he felt the <HI>Worms</HI> break in her Bowels; one Day, af|ter taking her Remedy, &s;he voided a Piece of <HI>Worm</HI> &s;even Ells long; and a few Days after, another Piece, without perceiv|ing as before that any thing broke; from which time &s;he became perfectly well. All the Pieces put together, would make above twenty Ells.</P>
<P><HI>Olaus Borrhicius</HI> tells us, That a Patient of his has voided eight hundred Foot of this <HI>Worm</HI> in &s;everal Pieces; and that hi|therto, he has not met with the Head; for the Patient declar'd, that always in the Voiding, he perceiv'd it break off.</P>

<P>Examples of the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> are innumera|ble, tho' many Authors have &s;et them down &s;o confu&s;edly, that 'tis not po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h whether they are the genuine <HI>Taenia,</HI> de&s;crib'd in the &s;econd Article, which is but one entire <HI>Worm,</HI> or this &s;purious Sort, con&s;i&s;ting of a Chain of <HI>Cucurbitini.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Ty&s;on</HI> mentions a Per&s;on in <HI>London,</HI> who has voided va&s;t Quantities of the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> for &s;everal Years together; but in &s;everal Pieces, two, three, four, &s;ix, or

<P>The&s;e Chains of <HI>Worms</HI> lye convoluted in &s;everal Places, and are &s;ometimes as long as all the Guts, and &s;ometimes va&s;tly ex|ceed that Length.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The Signs of <HI>Worms</HI> from Mr. <HI>Andry.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Signs of <HI>Worms</HI> are Common or Particular.</P>
<P>The common Signs &s;hew the Genius, and the Particular the Species; that is, when the Common meet, we &s;ay, there are <HI>Worms;</HI> and when we find particular Signs, we may &s;ay, not only that there are <HI>Worms</HI> in general, but that tho&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> are of &s;uch a particular Sort.</P>
<P>The common Signs are fiery &s;parkling Eyes, livid Cheeks, cold Sweats in the Nights, Abundance of Spittle drivelling from the Mouth in Sleep, great Drowth in the Day-time, Dryne&s;s of the Tongue and Lips, a Stinking-Breath, Grating of the Teeth in Sleep, a con&s;tant Loo&s;ene&s;s, with whiti&s;h Excrements, frothy Urine, &s;ometimes White, &s;ometimes Ob&s;cure, but for the mo&s;t part Thick and Muddy.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="41">
<P>Frequent Vomitings, and Convul&s;ion-Fits are &s;ometimes Signs of <HI>Worms;</HI> that is, when the Vomitings throw up nothing but what has been eaten, and the Convul&s;ions are without Foaming at the Mouth.</P>
<P>Sometimes they ri&s;e in their Sleep, and move their Lips as if they were eating: To know if the&s;e Symptoms are from <HI>Worms,</HI> ob&s;erve, if they are eas'd by Ab&s;tinence; for they that have <HI>Worms,</HI> cannot fa&s;t with|out finding them&s;elves tormented; not by Hunger, for many times they have no Ap|petite; but by Twitchings and Tearings, caus'd by the various Motions of the <HI>Worms</HI> in &s;earch of Food.</P>
<P>A dry Cough is very often a Sign of <HI>Worms;</HI> by this <HI>Fore&s;tus</HI> knew, that a lit|tle Girl, who had been &s;ix Months ill of a <HI>Quartan-Ague,</HI> was troubl'd with <HI>Worms;</HI> he pre&s;crib'd her Medicines accordingly, which brought away five <HI>Worms,</HI> and her <HI>Ague</HI> thereupon left her.</P>
<P>A Stinking-Breath is very often a Sign; &s;o <HI>Bra&s;&s;avolus,</HI> vi&s;iting an old Man eighty Years of Age, who &s;eem'd to lye a dying, knew by his Breath that he was troubl'd with <HI>Worms;</HI> he thereupon directed him
<PB N="43" REF="42">&s;ome <HI>Vermifuges,</HI> which &s;cour'd away five hundred <HI>Worms,</HI> and cur'd him.</P>
<P>Raging Hunger many times proceeds from <HI>Worms,</HI> when 'tis accompany'd with extream Leanne&s;s, tho' the Party eat much; thus a Boy, about twelve Years of Age (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Fore&s;tus) had kept his Bed for &s;eve|ral Months, and was dry'd almo&s;t to a <HI>Ske|leton,</HI> without feeling any other Illne&s;s than a &s;light Pain in his Belly, near his Navel: The Phy&s;ician was at fir&s;t a little at a &s;tand to find out the Di&s;temper, the Cau&s;e of which he could not imagine; for the Child eat very well, tho' to no Purpo&s;e; his Urine was of a good Con&s;i&s;tency and Co|lour, tho' &s;omewhat Crude and Wateri&s;h; but the Pain of his Belly, together with his extraordinary Hunger, caus'd him to &s;u&s;pect <HI>Worms:</HI> Therefore, for &s;everal Days, twice a Day, he order'd a Gla&s;s of the Decoc|tion of <HI>Hy&s;&s;op, Marjoram, Fennel, Fumitory, Centaury</HI> and <HI>Wormwood,</HI> with <HI>Oxymel,</HI> Sy|rup of <HI>Fumitory,</HI> and Honey of <HI>Ro&s;es.</HI> This Medicine, every time he took it, caus'd him to void a great Number of <HI>Worms,</HI> and perfectly cur'd him.</P>
<P>The particular Signs differ according to the Species of <HI>Worms.</HI></P>
<PB N="44" REF="43">
<P>The Signs of Long and Round <HI>Worms,</HI> are Ten&s;ions of the Belly, with Hardne&s;s and Pain, Itching of the No&s;e, Corro&s;ion of the Guts, Hiccoughs, a Palpitation in Sleep, Waking with &s;udden Startings, or Shrieks, an unequal Pul&s;e, intermitting Fevers, of which the Party will have three or four Fits, without any certain Order; the Eyes hollow, and &s;ometimes red; the Cheeks &s;ometimes glowing red, and &s;ome|times of a Lead Colour; &s;ometimes they want a Stomach, and vomit after Eating; they have Fevers, accompany'd with Cold in the extream Parts of the Body: The&s;e Signs never meet altogether, but &s;ome|times one, &s;ometimes another.</P>
<P>The Signs of <HI>A&s;carides</HI> are a continual Itching in the Fundament, cau&s;ing Faint|ings, and &s;ometimes Swoonings; the Itch|ing proceeds from the Motion of the&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> and the quick Sen&s;e of the Part where they lye.</P>
<P>The Signs of the <HI>Taenia,</HI> or Tape <HI>Worm,</HI> are La&s;&s;itude, and Faintings after Meat; frequent Numbne&s;s and Dulne&s;s in the Day|time, which cau&s;e an Heavine&s;s above the Navel, tho' the&s;e may proceed from other Cau&s;es.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="44">
<P>The Signs of the <HI>Cucurbitini</HI> are little Bodies, like the Seeds of <HI>Cucumers</HI> or <HI>Melons,</HI> found in the Excrements; I &s;up|po&s;e they are the young Brood not yet link'd together. Both <HI>Hippocrates</HI> and <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> mention the&s;e as certain Signs; to which may be added &s;hifting Pains of the Liver, accompany'd with great Fluxes of Spittle; Pains in the Stomach &s;ucceed tho&s;e of the Liver by Intervals, and &s;ome|times attended with tedious Pains in the Back.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>Some Ob&s;ervations from <HI>Baglivi.</HI></HEAD>
<P>When Children are ob&s;erv'd to rub their Bellies very much, 'tis a Sign of <HI>Worms;</HI> e&s;pecially if they are often grip'd.</P>
<P>Very often it happens, that Per&s;ons are &s;uddenly, and without any apparent Cau&s;e or Signs of any other Di&s;temper, reduc'd to the extreame&s;t Danger, like the A&s;&s;ault of an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> with Coldne&s;s of the ex|tream Parts, a creeping Pul&s;e (which is mo&s;t commonly a Sign of <HI>Worms,</HI> as is al&s;o the Hiccough) Swooning, and &s;ometimes a &s;udden Madne&s;s; in &s;uch a Ca&s;e we ought to &s;u&s;pect <HI>Worms,</HI> and to pre&s;cribe accordingly.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="45">
<P>Bleeding by Drops, in continual Fevers, from the No&s;trils, is &s;ometimes a Sign of <HI>Worms,</HI> as very Judicious Authors have a&s;|&s;erted.</P>
<P>Whenever there is the lea&s;t Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect <HI>Worms,</HI> by no Means defer the Ad|mini&s;tration of Remedies; for they often occa&s;ion &s;udden Death to grown Per&s;ons, as well as to Children or Infants.</P>
<P>Whatever Di&s;temper Children are trou|bled with, <HI>Worms,</HI> are always to be &s;u&s;pect|ed; for either they immediately encrea&s;e the Di&s;ea&s;e, or by Rea&s;on of its Continu|ance, the Seeds of <HI>Worms</HI> are hatch'd into Life, and fill the Bowels with that pe&s;tife|rous Vermine.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Remedies for the Destroy|ing of <HI>Worms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>And they are,</P>
<P N="1">1. EXternal Applications, as <HI>Fomenta|tions, Catapla&s;ms, Ointments, Pla|&s;ters,</HI> all which are not a little beneficial; For as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>Worms</HI> do &s;o &s;ecurely burrow, and intrench them&s;elves in the Foldings and Cavities of the Bowels, as to e&s;cape and elude the Impre&s;&s;ion of Purging, or other Medicines; for which Rea&s;on outward Applications are very u&s;e|ful to di&s;turb them from their lurking Pla|ces, and &s;o expo&s;e them to the Attacks of Internals, which may de&s;troy, and expel them.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="47">
<P N="2">2. Internal Admini&s;trations, which by a &s;pecifick Quality, di&s;turb and kill them; the Forms of the&s;e are various as <HI>Liquors, Syrups, Powders, Bolu&s;&s;es, Pills,</HI> &amp;c. where|of &s;ome are Purgative, others not; in the U&s;e of which Dr. <HI>Andry</HI> recommends the following Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>That the be&s;t Time to take them is in the Wain of the Moon; he confe&s;&s;es, he look'd upon this at fir&s;t as an idle Fancy, but that his Experience convinc'd him of his Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>That in the Admini&s;tration of Reme|dies for the <HI>Worms,</HI> there ought to be due Intermi&s;&s;ions; le&s;t being too vigorou&s;ly attack'd, they &s;hou'd retire into the Ca|vity of the <HI>Gut-Colon,</HI> where they wou'd be very much out of the reach of Medi|cines.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Gli&s;ters,</HI> they are ob&s;erv'd to be very u&s;eful, and they are of two general Kinds; Sweet and Bitter.</P>
<P>The Latter are of great Efficacy again&s;t the <HI>A&s;carides;</HI> which (as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> ob|&s;erves)
<PB N="49" REF="48">are a &s;mall, but an almo&s;t invin|cible Nation; for tho' you &s;hou'd wa&s;h away all by one <HI>Gli&s;ter,</HI> yet a new and numberle&s;s Off-&s;pring will quickly di&s;co|ver them&s;elves, being produc'd of the Seed of the former, depo&s;ited in the <HI>Rectum;</HI> &s;o that 'twill not be &s;ufficient to have ex|pell'd the Parents, unle&s;s their Po&s;terity be al&s;o vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted and de&s;troy'd; this may be done, if after the <HI>A&s;carides</HI> di&s;|appear, we do not pre&s;ently de&s;i&s;t, but re|peat the&s;e bitter Injections for &s;ome time, once in two or three Days at fir&s;t, and af|terwards once a Week.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>Teretes,</HI> or long and round <HI>Worms,</HI> the&s;e bitter Injections are by no Means proper, &s;o long as they are brisk, lively and agile, and inclin'd to get up into the Stomach, or &s;mall Guts, le&s;t be|ing driven upon tho&s;e Parts, they &s;hou'd occa&s;ion a great deal of Mi&s;chief there; but after the U&s;e of other Medicines, which have made them Sickly, and thru&s;t them down, the Exhibition of &s;uch <HI>Gli&s;ters</HI> may be very &s;ea&s;onable and &s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>
<P>The &s;weet <HI>Gli&s;ters</HI> made of Milk, Su|gar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are convenient before the U&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="49">of the Bibber ones, when the <HI>Worms</HI> are lurking in the &s;mall Guts, where, by gnaw|ing and tearing the Bowels, they excite violent Pains in the Belly; for the <HI>Worms</HI> take to the Milk, being plea&s;ant and agree|able to them, and &s;o leave off preying on the Bowels, and are al&s;o entic'd out of their Burrows, and following the agree|able Liquor, are di&s;pos'd to come away by Stool.</P>

<P>The <HI>Chyle (&s;ays he)</HI> appointed for the Nouri&s;hment of the <HI>Infant,</HI> is fir&s;t pre|par'd in the Stomach of the Mother, and render'd more perfect and pure by the Di|ge&s;tions and Glands of the Bowels. Now, &s;ince the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> are the general Seat of <HI>Worms,</HI> and the <HI>Fetus</HI> is for &s;everal Months nouri&s;h'd by this <HI>Chyle,</HI> the Seeds of <HI>Worms,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="55">which are in the Mother's Bowels, mixing with the Flower of the <HI>Chyle,</HI> are, by the u&s;ual Pa&s;&s;ages, carry'd along to the <HI>Mem|branes,</HI> which involve the <HI>Fetus:</HI> By this Means it may be ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd how the <HI>In|fant</HI> may receive this Verminous Progeny into its own Bowels. But if it happen, that the Mother be either entirely free, or having <HI>Worms,</HI> they &s;hou'd not happen to &s;pawn during the Time of her being pregnant, then, indeed, the <HI>Infant</HI> will not be infested with them in this Manner; but if this <HI>Infant</HI> &s;hou'd happen to be &s;uckl'd by another Woman, who has <HI>Worms,</HI> her Milk may furni&s;h the Child with a Colony of the&s;e In&s;ects, &s;ince Milk differs not from <HI>Chyle,</HI> and is convey'd from the Bowels to the Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>But whence (it may be demanded) have this Mother or Nur&s;e the&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> which they thus communicate to the Child? 'Tis an&s;wer'd, they have al&s;o receiv'd them in the Manner afore&s;aid; and that they have been &s;o convey'd down through all Ages, from the Beginning of the World, and the fir&s;t Parents of Mankind.</P>
<P>And, indeed, &s;ince the Seeds of Things, none excepted, were created at the Begin|ning of the World, all Sorts of In&s;ects,

<PB N="57" REF="58">may vie with Man him&s;elf for the Anti|quity of their Original; and fora&s;much as tho&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> which inhabit the Bowels of Mankind, are never found el&s;ewhere; it mu&s;t be inferr'd, that their Seeds were ori|ginally implanted in the Body of the fir&s;t Man, or Woman.</P>
<P>At this Rate, 'twill be objected, all Per|&s;ons mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the&s;e In&s;ects, or el&s;e their Succe&s;&s;ion might fail.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;uppos'd, that the Seeds or Eggs of <HI>Worms</HI> may lye a long Time within every Man's Body; and the&s;e, &s;ometime or other, as Occa&s;ion offers, be produc'd into Life, which, without &s;uch Occa&s;ion, wou'd have remain'd unchang'd: Thus, in a certain ancient Per&s;on, the Eggs of the <HI>Tape-Worm</HI> were hatch'd not 'till after the fifty fifth Year of his Age, at which Time he began to be mole&s;ted with that kind of <HI>Worm;</HI> either becau&s;e the Juices of his Bowels had never before gotten that Quality, which was requi&s;ite to vivify tho&s;e Eggs; or becau&s;e the Place was not rightly di&s;pos'd for that Purpo&s;e. But tho&s;e that in this Man were &s;o &s;lowly excluded, may be much &s;ooner in another, even before his Birth, or in his Childhood, or Youth, according as Cir|cum&s;tances may favour their Production.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="59">
<P>Again, in many Per&s;ons they may be never animated; becau&s;e there may be al|ways wanting a &s;uitable Di&s;po&s;ition of the Humours, or Place to produce them, ju&s;t as the Eggs of the <HI>Vermis Africanus;</HI> for Example, tho' they may be lodg'd in the Skin or Fle&s;h of every Many, yet this In|&s;ect troubles none but <HI>Africans, Indians</HI> and <HI>Arabians;</HI> not the Inhabitants of the <HI>Nor|thern</HI> Climates, becau&s;e the Heat of <HI>Africa,</HI> or <HI>India,</HI> promotes the Vivification of the&s;e Eggs, which cannot be animated in colder Countries; as on the other hand the Seeds of the <HI>Taenia,</HI> by Rea&s;on of the Moi&s;ture of the Climate, are render'd fruitful among&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which in <HI>India</HI> or <HI>Africa,</HI> becau&s;e of the extream Drine&s;s of tho&s;e Regions, are unprolifick.</P>
<P>This Notion is confirm'd by the Ob&s;er|vation of <HI>Hemmer&s;am,</HI> who &s;peaking of the <HI>Vermis Africanus,</HI> &s;ays, 'tis worth noting, that tho&s;e, who only &s;ail by <HI>Guiney,</HI> feel an Itching in the Skin, chiefly in that of the Arms and Legs; but mo&s;t commonly in the Thighs: This Itching certainly indi|cates the beginning Motion of the <HI>Vermis Africanus,</HI> excited by the Heat of that Country.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="60">
<P>Every one knows, how much Heat, and the Fermentation of Juices, conduces to the Production of Animals.</P>
<P>Neither is the &s;eeming U&s;ele&s;sne&s;s of &s;o many Seeds, con&s;equent upon this Notion, any ju&s;t Objection, when the &s;ame may be &s;aid of many other Seeds, whereof the much greater Part is often lo&s;t; and that Lo&s;s not to be accounted of, if we con&s;ider their infinite Number.</P>
<P>Nor, la&s;tly, ought we to object the of|ten long Continuance of the&s;e Eggs in the Body, before they are vivify'd; for as much as the Seeds of &s;everal Plants kept many Years, and afterwards committed to the Earth, do germinate as readily as if they had been fre&s;h; and the <HI>Ova</HI> of Wo|men advanc'd in Years, are often equally prolifick with tho&s;e of younger Women.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> then (may the Objector further argue) were created by God in the Body of <HI>Adam,</HI> either before his Fall, or afterwards; but if we con&s;ider Man as he was fir&s;t created, perfectly Innocent, it &s;eems not probable, that the ju&s;t and good God would implant &s;uch foul Vermine in his immaculate Body. And be&s;ides, as
<PB N="60" REF="61">that State of Innocence was entirely free from all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a perfect Happine&s;s, undi&s;turb'd by any Di&s;order of Body, it were impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have any <HI>Worms</HI> in his Bowels; which we find, by daily Experience, are the Cau&s;es of innumerable Di&s;orders; and even of Death it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Nor can it ea&s;ily be imagin'd, how this filthy In&s;ect, hatch'd, and nouri&s;h'd in Pu|trefaction, could &s;uit with that &s;weet man|ner of Living, directed by the Light of pure Rea&s;on, void of all Intemperance, and its Con&s;equences; which produce that putrid Humour, proper to receive, and pro|duce the Eggs of <HI>Worms.</HI></P>
<P>To have Recour&s;e to the Divine Pre&s;ci|ence in this Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That God fore&s;ee|ing the Apo&s;tacy of his Creature, prepar'd for his Puni&s;hment, would be very unrea|&s;onable, &s;ince the Suffering &s;hould by no means preceed the Offence.</P>
<P>If on the other hand we &s;ay, that the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> were form'd after the Alteration of his Nature, by his Di&s;obedience to the Di|vine Command, the Difficulty will be yet greater; for then 'twill follow, that God began a new Creation, which is contrary
<PB N="61" REF="62">to the Tenour of the &s;acred Scriptures, which inform us that God, before he crea|ted Man, produc'd all other Creatures; not excepting In&s;ects.</P>
<P>To remove the&s;e Objections, 'tis a&s;&s;erted, That before Man's Formation, all other Animals, Plants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were created; and that Man was la&s;t form'd out of the Mud.</P>
<P>That in this Mud, tho&s;e <HI>Worms,</HI> which were a little before created, were implant|ed, and &s;o enter'd in the Compo&s;ition of his Body, being probably de&s;ign'd by Provi|dence, whil&s;t he continu'd Innocent, to be very u&s;eful to him, and to contribute to the Perfection of his Body; and, &s;hould he af|ter lap&s;e from his Integrity, become a Pu|ni&s;hment to him.</P>
<P>Now, tho' this may &s;eem &s;trange, that <HI>Worms</HI> &s;hould any way conduce to the Be|nefit and Perfection of our Bodies, yet let us con&s;ider.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e <HI>Machines,</HI> which are &s;elf-moving, as Watches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are always e|&s;teem'd more Perfect and Surprizing, the more they comprehend other <HI>Machines,</HI> e|qually Curious, within their Structure. And
<PB N="62" REF="63">is not the World accounted more Perfect, by containing &s;uch an infinite Variety of Animals, great and &s;mall, honourable and ba&s;e, as they are call'd; if any of its Countries prove de&s;titute of Inhabitants, are they not accounted unhappy, and de&s;|picable? Why &s;hould not, then, our little World be e&s;teem'd more compleat, by being furni&s;h'd with its proper Inhabi|tants?</P>
<P>Nor would it be any Injury to our fir&s;t Parent, to &s;uppo&s;e his Body the Recepta|cle of various and wonderful In&s;ects, which, whil&s;t he continu'd Innocent, were &s;o far from being Pernicious to him, that they render'd him more Perfect, and redounded to his Honour. They liv'd quietly, and amicably with him, and &s;ed on the Super|fluities of indige&s;ted Food only; they ex|ceeded not their ju&s;t Limits, they ab&s;tain'd from preying on the Bowels, and did no Injury to the Walls of their Inclo&s;ures, but gently licking and clean&s;ing their Man|&s;ions; they gratefully requited the Bene|fit of their Reception: Moreover, if the Fibres of the Bowels were at any time become torpid, or oppre&s;s'd with too copi|ous, or excrementitious Juices, which might be detrimental to the Body; the&s;e might excite them to the brisker Di&s;charge of
<PB N="63" REF="64">their Functions; in &s;hort, they might be no ways Noxious, but very Beneficial.</P>
<P>But this Felicity of <HI>Adam</HI> prov'd but &s;hort; for by Rebelling again&s;t his Maker, the Natures of all Things were &s;oon chang'd; and then the&s;e <HI>Worms</HI> al&s;o became the Mi|ni&s;ters of Divine Vengeance, as well as <HI>Lyons, Tigers, Serpents,</HI> and other de&s;tructive Animals.</P>
