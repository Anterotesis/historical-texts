<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE three fir&s;t of the following Ca&s;es have already, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, been communicated to the Publick, through the Candour of the <HI>Learned Gentleman</HI> to whom they are addre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>It may be &s;eemingly unnece&s;&s;ary therefore perhaps to publi&s;h them again: But as there is &s;omething in each of them which is very re|markable, and One of them in particular, &s;eems to clear up a Point of con&s;iderable Con&s;e|quence with re&s;pect to <HI>Inoculation,</HI> it cannot be ami&s;s, I think, to give them a Chance at lea&s;t, of being, if po&s;&s;ible, a little more pub|lick: Be&s;ides, there are &s;everal Additions to the two la&s;t of them &s;ince they were &s;ent to the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the other Ca&s;es are taken from &s;ome <HI>Adver&s;aria,</HI> or Manu&s;cript Notes, which I have, as well as an Account of &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es, both Acute and Chronical, in Manu&s;cript like|wi&s;e,
<PB REF="3">of Dr. <HI>Browne</HI>'s, Son of the famous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of the <HI>Religio Medici.</HI><Q>Nec &s;atis e&s;t vulga&s;&s;e Fidem &mdash;</Q> but the Author likewi&s;e of <HI>P&s;eudodoxia Epidemica,</HI> and of &s;everal other valuable Treati&s;es.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Thomas Browne,</HI> and who was him&s;elf likewi&s;e a Per&s;on of great Learning and Emi|nence, and <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> to St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> for upwards of &s;ix and twenty Years, and &s;ucceeded therein by Dr. <HI>Cade,</HI> in <HI>October, Anno Domini, 1708.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them was communicated to him by one <HI>R. G.</HI> an <HI>Apothecary</HI> at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and the Minutes of it are &s;aid to have been taken from Mr. <HI>Long</HI>'s own Mouth, as may be &s;een by the &s;aid <HI>R. G</HI>'s Letter, dated <HI>July 11, 1692,</HI> and is by no means an inaccurate Relation. The three others, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dormer</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s, and the Marquis of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI>'s, came directly within his own Ob&s;ervation, and have &s;omething in them which is very well worth Notice, as well as that brief Account of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which is chiefly likewi&s;e taken from his Manu&s;cript Papers.</P>
<P>There are but two Ca&s;es be&s;ides; One of them, of the &s;ame kind with That in the fir&s;t <HI>Letter</HI> to Mr. <HI>Folkes,</HI> tho' not of the &s;ame fortunate Event: The other, taken from <HI>Tulpius,</HI> which I hope there is no occa&s;ion to make any Apology for, e&s;pecially con&s;idering how appo&s;ite it &s;eems to be to &s;ome of tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations, which oc|curr'd
<PB REF="4">to me upon Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s Ca&s;e, and to <HI>another Ca&s;e of the Stone</HI> which has lately made a great deal of Noi&s;e in the World.</P>
<P>That <HI>Letter</HI> of Dr. <HI>Freind</HI>'s to Dr. <HI>Cock|burne,</HI> which is added after the&s;e Ca&s;es, is ac|counted for in <HI>the Epi&s;tle</HI> that precedes it: I have nothing further therefore, I think, to trouble the World with at pre&s;ent,</P>

<HEAD>CASE <HI>the</HI> FIRST. AN ACCOUNT OF A Per&s;on who made <HI>Bloody Water</HI> in the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and yet recover'd: In a LETTER to <HI>MARTIN FOLKES,</HI> E&s;q; PRESIDENT of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_MAKING Bloody Water is uni|ver&s;ally e&s;teem'd as terrible a Symp|tom as any that can happen in the Small-Pox, and all who have wrote concerning that Di&s;temper do una|nimou&s;ly agree, that it is a certain Forerunner of approaching Death. Dr. <HI>Cade</HI> indeed &s;ays, in his Letter to Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> concerning Purg|ing in that Di&s;temper, that he has &s;ometimes cur'd this Symptom by the help of Camphire,
<PB N="2" REF="7">and a copious Quantity of Acids; but then he adds, that this Relief was only temporary, and that, to confe&s;s the Truth, he never knew any Body that made that &s;ort of Water, who ever &s;urviv'd the 16th Day from the Eruption, and <HI>there is no Body whom I know of,</HI> that has been conver&s;ant in this Di&s;temper, but has con&s;tantly experienc'd, &s;ooner or later, the like Fatality in con&s;equence of it: I mean, when this &s;ort of Urine has plainly proceeded from a broken Cra&s;is or Contexture, or as it were a thorough Di&s;&s;olution of the whole Ma&s;s of Blood: For I know very well you &s;hall now and then have &s;everal Streaks, and &s;ometimes larger Quantities of Blood, in the Urine, from the Acrimony of the Salts that are in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Flies, upon the Application of Bli&s;ters, which are frequently ordered, and <HI>mo&s;tly likewi&s;e</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in one or other of the <HI>Stadia</HI> of this Di&s;temper, and yet the Patient &s;hall do well. And Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> who was a very worthy Predece&s;&s;or of mine in St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Ho&s;|pital, gives an Account of a Gentlewoman that liv'd in <HI>Dean's Yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who made bloody Urine in the Small-Pox, for four or five Days together, and that Dr. <HI>Needham,</HI> who attended her <HI>along</HI> with him, did, upon that account, for&s;ake her, and yet &s;he did well; but that they found afterwards, that this bloody Urine was not occa&s;ion'd by the Malignancy
<PB N="3" REF="8">of the Di&s;temper, but by a &s;harp Stone which was at that time de&s;cending from one of the Kidneys, through the Ureters, into the Blad|der, and which &s;he afterwards voided. This I have from &s;ome <HI>Adver&s;aria</HI> of his, a good number of which I have had the fortune to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal Years, and among which there are likewi&s;e &s;everal other re|markable Ca&s;es that occurr'd to him during the cour&s;e of a very long and exten&s;ive, as well as &s;ucce&s;sful Practice.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject.</P>
<P>It cannot but be a Satisfaction therefore, to a Per&s;on of your Humanity and Goodne&s;s, to hear of an In&s;tance in which this frightful Symptom was not attended with its u&s;ual Fa|tality; and it was in the Ca&s;e of a young Gentleman of about 16 Years of Age, Son to one Colonel <HI>Ellit&s;on,</HI> a Gentleman of very con&s;iderable Fortune and Worth in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>He was taken with a Fever and great Pain in his Head on <HI>April</HI> the 20th la&s;t, and had the Small-Pox come out upon him the Day fol|lowing, notwith&s;tanding which the &s;ame Symp|toms &s;till continued, and <HI>nothing almo&s;t</HI> would &s;tay in his Stomach, and his Head likewi&s;e was very delirious: <HI>He was oblig'd therefore to be</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="9">blooded, and had Bli&s;ters applied to his Neck and to his Arms, which, together with a pro|per Quantity of <HI>Pulvis e chelis Cancror. comp.</HI> and Nitre, were the fir&s;t Things that I had an Opportunity of ordering for him.</P>
<P>The next Day every thing was more quiet, and &s;o again the third Day from the Eruption; but the Small-Pox were very numerous all over him, and of a rank angry Sort, as they gene|rally are, I think, in mo&s;t of your <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Con&s;titutions; but this young Gentleman had be&s;ides overheated him&s;elf a little before, upon acting his Part among the re&s;t of his School-Fellows, at the <HI>Montum</HI> near <HI>Eaton.</HI></P>
<P>Things continued in the &s;ame State the fourth Day, but towards the Evening there were a few Streaks of Blood mix'd with, and &s;ub&s;iding in his Water, which did not much alarm me, becau&s;e I did not know but it might be caus'd by the Bli&s;ters. I had but one Rea|&s;on to doubt the contrary, and that was, he had little or no Strangury; but &s;ome Per&s;ons did a&s;&s;ure me that they had known &s;uch, or even a more bloody &s;ort of Water occa&s;ion'd by Bli&s;ters, even tho' there was no Strangury. I was willing therefore to hope the be&s;t, and &s;o made no other Alteration in my Proce&s;s than to direct a plentiful U&s;e of Spirit of Vitriol.</P>
<P>What was order'd happen'd to &s;ucceed: We had no more of that &s;ort of Water, either
<PB N="5" REF="10">that Night, or the next Day, or the Morning following: But I was &s;ent for in a great hurry that Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 6th in the Afternoon, and found his Friends in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, not only becau&s;e it return'd, but becau&s;e it began to increa&s;e upon them, and was pouring off in a very free manner;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No Notice was taken of this, either to the Society, or in the Account which is given of this Affair in the <HI>Tran&s;actions,</HI> the Rea&s;ons for which you will &s;ee towards the Beginning of the &s;ub&s;equent Letter.</NOTE> a Specimen of which I herewith &s;end you.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary therefore to proceed in ano|ther Method, and I accordingly pre&s;crib'd him <HI>Gum. Arabic. Oliban. &amp; Pulv. Amyl. ana</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s. <HI>Alumin. nup. gr.</HI> iv. to be taken <HI>&s;extis horis,</HI> in 3 or 4 Spoonfuls of a Mixture, <HI>ex Aqua.

Fort. ana.</HI> &ounce;ii. to be us'd <HI>ad libit,</HI> had the de&s;ired Effect, and the Bloodine&s;s of the Urine began to abate in about 10 or 12 Hours, and in 10 or 12 Hours more to go thoroughly off, &s;o that by the next Day in the Evening the Urine was return'd to its natural State and Colour.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="11">
<P>There was nothing farther ob&s;ervable in the cour&s;e of this Ca&s;e, except that the Di&s;tem|per was of the Coherent Kind, and according|ly attended with many other dubious Symp|toms likewi&s;e: For tho' it is generally thought that the Coherent Sort is not &s;o formidable as the Confluent, yet, as Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> has judi|ciou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd, and Dr. <HI>Moreton</HI> before him, there is not &s;o much difference between them, but they are almo&s;t always attended with much the &s;ame Appearances, and the &s;ame Fevers plainly, at the time of Maturation; for that the Danger does not ari&s;e &s;o much from the Sort, as from the Number of the Pu&s;tules, which if it be great, there is the like Rea&s;on to be fearful of the Event, whether they flux, or whether they only cohere: All which not|with&s;tanding this young Gentleman had the good Fortune to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I have nothing farther to detain you with at pre&s;ent but one &s;hort Reque&s;t, and that is, that you will be &s;o good as to believe me with all the Re&s;pect and E&s;teem imagin|able,</P>

<HEAD>CASE <HI>the</HI> SECOND <HI>and</HI> THIRD. A SECOND LETTER to <HI>MARTIN FOLKES,</HI>E&s;q; PRESIDENT of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Vindication of the foregoing CASE. Together with Two other very remarkable <HI>Small-Pox</HI> Ca&s;es.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter proper">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I DID my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure, &s;ome time &s;ince, to &s;end you an Ac|count of a young Gentleman who made Bloody Water in the Cour&s;e of the Small-Pox, and yet recover'd, and you were &s;o obliging as to give it a Place in a &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Tran&s;action.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing however which I could wi&s;h had not been omitted, and <HI>that</HI> is, that I &s;ent you likewi&s;e a Sample of that Wa|ter,
<PB N="8" REF="13">by which you might &s;ee whether it was, or was not, of that formidable Sort which I took it to be; but Dr. <HI>Mortimer</HI> tells me, there were &s;everal Gentlemen at the Society who had never had the Small-Pox, and that &s;ome of them might probably be very much afraid of it, and that it was not therefore thought advi&s;eable that the &s;aid Sample &s;hou'd be produc'd, and that it not having been pro|duc'd before the Society he, through Inadver|tency, did forget to take any Notice of it in the Publication.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e mu&s;t therefore re&s;t upon the bare Relation, as it does: All that I &s;hall &s;ay far|ther in relation to it is, That it was a more thorough bloody Urine, and in a larger Quantity, than is ever occa&s;ion'd by Bli&s;ters, and entirely of that kind as &s;eldom ever fails to be fatal: <HI>Et quamvis Remedia propo&s;ita &s;int vulgaria, hic Ca&s;us tamen ob&s;ervationem meruit propter Eventum non vulgarem, ex omnibus enim Variolis laborantibus quos mihi tot&acirc; vit&acirc; videre contigit, hic unicus fuit qui ex Fluxu &s;anguineo eva&s;erit, &s;ed in caeteris certum Mortis prae&s;agium fuit, magn&acirc; prae|&s;ertim &s;anguinis copi&acirc; affluente;</HI> as <HI>Riverius</HI> had the Good-fortune to be able to &s;ay before me, in a parallel Ca&s;e which came before him, <HI>Centur. prim&acirc; Ob&s;ervation:,</HI> &mdash; Ob&s;ervat. lxxi. &mdash; I call it a parallel Ca&s;e,
<PB N="9" REF="14">tho' This was a <HI>Fluxus Alvei,</HI> becau&s;e the Progno&s;tick is the &s;ame, whether the Effu&s;ion of Blood be <HI>per Alveum, vel per Ve&s;icam.</HI></P>
<P>What I have to offer to you now is a Ca&s;e of a different Nature, but an In&s;tance like|wi&s;e of the Recovery of a Gentleman who had this Di&s;temper in as terrible a manner as can well be conceiv'd, and that by a Regimen altogether as extraordinary.</P>
<P>It was one Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e,</HI> Grand&s;on to the learned and good Dr. <HI>Hooper,</HI> at that time Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath and Wells,</HI> and the pre&s;ent worthy and &s;teady Repre&s;entative of his Country for the County of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and is taken from a Letter which was &s;ent to a Friend of mine, from one of the neare&s;t Re|lations that Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e</HI> had, and who was with him during the whole time, <HI>viz.</HI> his Mother, dated <HI>October</HI> 31, 1719.</P>
<P>He had the Small-Pox came out upon him <HI>October</HI> 15, 1719, and on the 17th, <HI>i. e.</HI> the third Day, at Night, was &s;eiz'd with a vio|lent Shortne&s;s of Breath, which increas'd upon him the 18th in the Morning, &s;o that he was in danger of being what they call throttled, had the Hiccups, rattled in his Throat, fetch'd his Breath double, grew &s;en&s;ele&s;s, look'd black and blue, was convuls'd all over, and lo&s;t one Pul&s;e in four.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="15">
<P>This till Eight at Night, during which time they pour'd in as much Wine, Brandy, and Spirits, as they cou'd, every Quarter of an Hour, but about that time he began to be in &s;uch a State as they cou'd not get in any more, and he fell into a &s;ort of Slumber, out of which he wak'd in a very little time, and was &s;omething better: So from thence they continued him in the &s;ame Cour&s;e, drinking nothing weaker than Strong Beer, and that with at lea&s;t two or three Spoonfuls of Brandy, or Spirits, in every Draught of it, once every Hour, to the 27th, or the 13th after the Eruption: And what is very re|markable, if they let him lie any time an Hour or two extraordinary without the&s;e Liquors, he would grow light-headed, hot, and &s;ick, but upon returning to them would grow cool and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The Night between the 27th and the 28th was a very bad one, in&s;omuch that it was as much as three Per&s;ons cou'd do to hold him in his Bed, but about Seven in the Morning he came entirely to him&s;elf, and was from that time thoroughly out of Danger; but during the Cour&s;e that he was in before, which was from the 18th to the Morning of the 28th, be&s;ides his other Potables, which were all heighten'd and made &s;trong with Drops or Spirits, he drank &s;ix and twenty
<PB N="11" REF="16">Quarts and one Pint of Liquor, the &s;malle&s;t of which was Strong Beer, and the greate&s;t part the &s;tronge&s;t Wine that cou'd be got, be&s;ides a full Quart of Brandy.</P>
<P>All this while he did not know that it was the Small-Pox, but fancied it was a Surfeit which he had got by his having eaten too heartily of Pork, and was about 12 Years old when this happen'd.</P>
<P>The Eclat of this Recovery did a great deal of Credit to old Dr. <HI>Betten&s;on,</HI> under who&s;e Care he was at the <HI>Bath,</HI> who, as he was a very eminent and good Phy&s;ician, did every thing incumbent upon a Per&s;on of Skill and Integrity in a regular manner, previous to the&s;e terrible Appearances, but found him&s;elf, as he thought then, oblig'd to go a good deal out of the way, in order to &s;upport him, if po&s;&s;ible, under the Violence of them, and was after|wards in a manner nece&s;&s;itated to go on with it by what is above related: And his Succe&s;s in this Ca&s;e, if I am rightly inform'd, encourag'd him to treat &s;ome of his future Small-Pox Pa|tients, more particularly the pre&s;ent Earl <HI>Pow|let,</HI> and a Brother or two of his, in much the &s;ame manner, and that without any &s;ini&s;ter Event; but not being Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Ca&s;es, I can't &s;ay any thing more as to them.</P>

<P>Give me leave only to remark, That the Gentlemen of that County have, for the mo&s;t part, good <HI>Stamina,</HI> and that it happens like|wi&s;e very fortunately, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;es of &s;uch extreme Danger as that of Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e</HI> was, <HI>ut &amp; &s;int,</HI> as <HI>Horace</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>dura Ilia, &amp; ut, quicquid Veneni &s;aeviat in praecor|diis, Medici &s;innt, qui iis auxiliatricem expor|rigant manum.</HI></P>
<P>I did not think to trouble you with any thing more at pre&s;ent, but another Small-Pox Ca&s;e being lately come to my Hands, I was not willing to lo&s;e the Opportunity of com|municating it.</P>
<P>It is the Ca&s;e of a little Boy, Son to Mr. <HI>Richards,</HI> Member of Parliament for <HI>Bridport</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire.</HI> He was inoculated about three Years ago, at the Age of about 3, and had the Small-Pox come out upon him to the number of 50 or 60, and they matura|ted and &s;cabb'd, and went off in the &s;ame manner that that &s;ort of Pock, which was a regular and di&s;tinct one, generally does: But about two Years afterwards, <HI>i. e.</HI> about a Year ago, he had the Small-Pox again, and there came out between 2 and 300, which maturated and &s;cabb'd likewi&s;e, and went through the &s;ame Stages, and in the &s;ame manner that the former did, only he was
<PB N="13" REF="18">wor&s;e before the Eruption, but when that was compleated had no manner of Di&s;order except too much of an Appetite, as is u&s;ual every now and then, in and after the Small-Pox.</P>
<P>This is authenticated to me by a Letter which I have from a learned and experienced Phy&s;ician in tho&s;e Parts, Dr. <HI>Brodrepp,</HI> who is likewi&s;e Grandfather to the Child, and attended him upon both Occa&s;ions: And, whatever may be &s;aid in eva&s;ion of other Ga&s;es, in which Per&s;ons that have been inocu|lated have had the Small-Pox afterwards, as That the Inoculation did not take place, There was no Eruption, at lea&s;t no Variolous one, and the like, is certainly an In&s;tance that All is not to be depended upon that is given out in favour of, or is expected from Inoculation, and that it is, by no means, an effectual Se|curity from one's having the Small-Pox again.</P>

<HEAD><HI>POSTSCRIPT</HI> to the above Letter.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I wrote this, I have likewi&s;e had an Opportunity of being afre&s;h &s;atisfied of what is above related with re&s;pect to Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e,</HI> with the&s;e further Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That he was at fir&s;t treated in the &s;ame manner that other People u&s;ually are, and put into a very temperate, if not too cool a Regimen.</P>
<P>That the Small-Pox, thereupon, did not come on, or rather &s;truck in, and that in con&s;equence thereof, he was brought into the Straits in which he was upon the third and fourth Days.</P>
<P>That, upon this, Dr. <HI>Betten&s;on</HI> told Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e</HI>'s Relations, of the good Effects which he had &s;ometimes &s;een from a free U&s;e of Strong and Spirituous Liquors, in his Practice among People in the Country, but did not care to venture upon it in a Per&s;on of &s;uch tender Years, and of &s;uch con&s;equence as Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e</HI> was; but that it was in&s;i&s;ted upon that he &s;hou'd do it, it being apparently a de|&s;perate Ca&s;e, and there being nothing el&s;e &s;eemingly to be done.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="21">
<P>That they accordingly enter'd upon it, and went on with it, but more frequently than as it is above mention'd, being never able to di&s;continue the pouring in of them by as much as he cou'd take, for a Quarter of an Hour, without a &s;en&s;ible Detriment to him.</P>
<P>That the Strong Beer which he drank was &s;ome that his Grandfather had brewed when he was Dean of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and brought with him from thence, which was then a matter of &s;ixteen Years before, and of the Black or Noggi&s;h &s;ort, of near 20 Bu&s;hels to the Hog&s;head.</P>
<P>That the good Event of this Proce&s;s occa|&s;ion'd a pretty general Run into a like one, in tho&s;e Parts, during the time that the Small-Pox was &s;o rife, and of &s;o malignant a Sort, as it was that Winter and the Spring following, and that the Failure of it in &s;ome In&s;tances was thought to be owing to too negligent an Attendance to it, or the not plying them duly and &s;ufficiently with &s;uch-like Liquors.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, That it had been generally thought that Mr. <HI>Prou&s;e</HI>'s Cure, extraordinary as it was, could not well be a&s;crib'd to any thing el&s;e, but that <HI>a Phy&s;ician of the fir&s;t

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Together with a &s;hort Account of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>_SINCE I wrote the foregoing Let|ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have met with a Ca&s;e of the &s;ame Nature with the Fir&s;t, in which there was Rea&s;on, as I thought, to hope for the &s;ame for|tunate Event, and of which I will likewi&s;e give a brief Account, notwith&s;tanding I was di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>It was in a Servant of my own, a Lad of about 19 Years old, who was &s;eiz'd with a <HI>violent Pain in his Back,</HI> which he imputed to his having help'd the Brewer's Servants in carrying down Drink; but which continuing, notwith&s;tanding he was blooded and had a Plai&s;ter put upon it, and being attended like|wi&s;e with a Pain in his Head (tho' not a great one) the Day following, I immediately appre|hended that it was the Forerunner of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and that of a bad Sort; I &s;ay of a
<PB N="19" REF="24">bad Sort, becau&s;e I have &s;carce ever known that Symptom to have preceded and to per&s;i&s;t, but the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> has proved of a very dan|gerous Sort, and almo&s;t con&s;tantly fatal: Which is more than I remember to have been ob&s;erv'd by any body that has hitherto treated concerning this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The Eruption en&s;ued, <HI>i. e.</HI> began to &s;hew it&s;elf, on the third Day, and <HI>Bloody Water</HI> upon the fourth from that, or the &s;eventh from the Inva&s;ion, and continued that and the next Day, and great part of the Day follow|ing; and there were other Symptoms, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Delirium</HI> and <HI>Diarrhoea, and great Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s and Inquietude,</HI> which attended him likewi&s;e from ju&s;t before the Eruption to almo&s;t that time, notwith&s;tanding he had been Blooded again, and had a Bli&s;ter <HI>inter Scapulas,</HI> and taken all proper temperate Re&s;tringents the whole while.</P>
<P>What was farther remarkable in this Ca&s;e is, that he went on pretty tolerably for Num|ber and Sort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after this until the fifteenth Day, but was then &s;eiz'd with a &s;udden <HI>De|liquium,</HI> and in &s;uch a State that it was almo&s;t impracticable to get any thing down, and he was &s;eemingly expiring. They made a &s;hift however to get down, every now and then, a Spoonful or two of <HI>Lac Ammoniac</HI> and <HI>Tinctura Croci,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>Serpentaria</HI> in it,
<PB N="20" REF="25">and a couple of Bli&s;ters were applied <HI>infra Cu|bitos,</HI> by means of which he came to him&s;elf, and was likely enough to live the next Morn|ing; and continuing &s;o that Day, which was the Sixteenth from the Eruption, and which has been ob&s;erv'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ca&s;e I. Page 2.</NOTE> to be the late&s;t that any One has been known to &s;urvive who ever made <HI>&s;uch dreadful Water;</HI> and continuing &s;o like|wi&s;e with not much of a Fever, and &s;ome|thing of an Appetite, and two or three Stools a Day, and good Apprehen&s;ions for him&s;elf, for two Days more, I cannot but think there was Rea&s;on to hope he might have done well: But unluckily for him, <HI>the Fever ro&s;e upon him</HI> again <HI>the third time,</HI> to a very high degree, the next Day in the Evening, and threw every thing into Confu&s;ion, and he died upon the 19th Day of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, having had the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> come out upon him the 30th of the Month before.</P>

<P>AS I am upon <HI>Small-Pox</HI> Ca&s;es, it will not be unacceptable, I hope, if I add &s;ome|thing concerning that Di&s;temper in general, e&s;pecially as it is partly taken from the <HI>Ad|ver&s;aria</HI> of that <HI>Learned Gentleman</HI> who is mention'd in the Preface, and to whom the Reader will be further oblig'd in mo&s;t of the &s;ub&s;equent Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is a contagious Di&s;temper, and as terrible as any of them, very many dy|ing of it, more particularly when it is accom|panied, as it generally is, with a Fever of a dangerous Kind.</P>
<P>This, when they are many, or of the Flux, or Confluent Sort; on the contrary, when the Patient has but a few, and the Fever cea&s;es upon the Eruption, no Di&s;ea&s;e is more fa|vourable, and you may &s;ometimes meet them walking about their Affairs, with the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in their Faces, in the open Streets of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>No Di&s;ea&s;e likewi&s;e in which there is more of a Cri&s;is than in the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> for by the fourth Day, at furthe&s;t, after the Inva&s;ion, the Eruption is evident; by the &s;eventh it is per|fected, or all are come out; by the eleventh they dry away, or turn into Scabs; and by
<PB N="22" REF="27">the fourteenth they fall off; tho' in the Flux Sort they are often &s;lower, and &s;ome die after the fourteenth, nay on the &s;eventeenth, and twentieth Days, altho' few have Strength enough to hold out &s;o long.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fever,</HI> as has been &s;aid, generally joined with the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and when it cea&s;es not upon the Eruption, apt however for &s;ome Days after it to be more remi&s;s: but on the &s;eventh from the Eruption it increa&s;es again, and returns with &s;ome Violence; and this is what is generally called the <HI>Second Fever,</HI> and occa&s;ions the Danger, which continues for &s;ome Days: Nay in the Flux Sort &s;ome are &s;o un|fortunate as to have <HI>a third Fever</HI> &s;even Days after the &s;econd, in which Ca&s;e very few e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The <HI>Small-Pox</HI> favourable,</P>

<HEAD>The Fifth Ca&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dormer,</HI> who lodg'd then in <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> had a very ill Sort of <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which ran all together, and covered mo&s;t of the Superficies of his Skin, both in Face and Body, and was in danger from the Beginning. When the time came that they &s;hou'd dry away, and the <HI>&s;econd Fever</HI> increas'd upon him, they &s;tood <HI>like a Quagmire</HI> all about him, and wou'd advance no further, notwith|&s;tanding many powerful Remedies were given
<PB N="24" REF="29">him. In this difficult Ca&s;e <HI>the Doctor</HI> delayed no longer, but gave him <HI>a Drachm of the Bark</HI> in Sub&s;tance, and repeated it every &s;ix Hours at furthe&s;t, till he had taken about <HI>an Ounce and an half of it.</HI> His Nights were &s;o bad before, notwith&s;tanding many quieting Remedies which he had taken, that each of them, as it was fear'd, wou'd be his la&s;t; but the fir&s;t Night after he began with the <HI>Bark</HI> was quieter, and the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> on both Sides of his Face began to dry; the &s;econd Night his Face was all dried, and &s;ome of his Body ad|vanc'd very much, and after the third Night all the Symptoms abated, and he &s;eem'd to be in great Safety, and very &s;uddenly recover'd to the great Joy of all his numerous Friends.</P>
<P><HI>The Doctor</HI>'s general <HI>Proce&s;s</HI> as to this Di&s;temper upon other Occa&s;ions, much the &s;ame as has been ever &s;ince, <HI>except as to Bleeding,</HI> which he re&s;trains to a Plethoric Habit, and the Time before the Eruption; tho' at the &s;ame time he informs us, that at <HI>Paris</HI> they let them Blood any Day after the Appearance, but &s;ays this is not practis'd here in <HI>England; and</HI> excepting likewi&s;e <HI>as to Bli&s;|ters,</HI> which he does not &s;o much as advi&s;e the U&s;e of, or make any mention of in the whole Country, or in any State of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and which I am the more &s;urprized at, becau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="30">he takes great Notice of them, and advi&s;es one at lea&s;t to be kept continually open and running during the whole cour&s;e of the ma|lady, in Malignant and Pe&s;tilential Fevers, and &s;ays that the great U&s;e of them came fir&s;t to be known during the <HI>Pe&s;tilential Con&s;titution,</HI> which was <HI>Anno</HI> 1664 and 1665, and had continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his Proce&s;s, <HI>Pectoral Drinks, Lambatives, and Po&s;&s;et-Drink, with Tares</HI> in it in ca&s;e that the Lungs, and <HI>Gargles and Mucilages</HI> in ca&s;e that the Throat is affected, together with <HI>Dia&s;cordium, Theriaca,</HI> or <HI>Phi|lonium,</HI> in ca&s;e of a Loo&s;ene&s;s, <HI>and an Ounce of Diacodium</HI> every Night in ca&s;e of Inquie|tude; and, if the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> prove long la&s;t|ing, &s;ome temperate Cordial, and to &s;upply the Spirits often with a Draught of it, in ca&s;e of Faintne&s;s, and <HI>thorough Purging</HI> when the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is well off, and the Patient fit for it.</P>
<P>There is one thing further which the <HI>Doctor</HI> takes notice of, and that is, that many Waters, Oils and Unguents, or Liniments, are frequently made u&s;e of, in order to pre|&s;erve the Face, after the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> all which he thinks altogether u&s;ele&s;s, if not hurtful; and that a little Flower, or white Starch, well dried, and &s;haken upon the Face, is preferable to them all. Nay, if you let no|thing
<PB N="26" REF="31">that is moi&s;t, or grea&s;y, touch the Face for fifteen Days, the Face, he &s;ays, will &s;carce be red, at lea&s;t not &s;o red as it will otherwi&s;e be; and if for a long while after you forbear to wa&s;h it, it will be the better, and the mo&s;t that you need to do is to breathe upon a warm Handkerchief, and to wipe your Face with it.</P>

In con&s;equence of this likewi&s;e, the <HI>Joints of his Fingers</HI> became <HI>crooked</HI> and inflexible; the <HI>Patella</HI> of his right Knee <HI>fix'd;</HI> his <HI>Po&s;ture</HI> decrepit, and <HI>quite double,</HI> with extreme Pain in his Hips and Small of the Back; the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>Joints</HI> of his <HI>Thighs, Legs, Ancles,</HI> and <HI>Feet, motionle&s;s,</HI> &s;o that he was carried about from Place to Place, not able to put the lea&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="33">Stre&s;s upon the Ground; his Stomach, lo&s;t; his thir&s;t, unquenchable; his Face meagre, pale and yellow; the <HI>Hair of his Head, gray,</HI> and <HI>the whole Habit of his Body, emaciated</HI> to Skin and Bones. To the&s;e Afflictions were frequently added, <HI>terrible Fits of the Stone,</HI> to which &s;ort of Concretions the En|trails of his Body were &s;o much di&s;pos'd, that after &s;ix Weeks u&s;e of the <HI>Bath Waters,</HI> leaving his Waters, by chance, for &s;even Days, the <HI>Urinal</HI> was <HI>cru&s;ted all over</HI> with a perfect hard Stone <HI>like a Pumice,</HI> thicker than a Crown-piece.</P>
<P>This was his Ca&s;e when he began to drink the <HI>Bath Waters</HI> at the End of <HI>April,</HI> 1691; and he drank them hot in the Morning, and cold at Meals; and in a little time was recon|ciled to them for his con&s;tant Drink, without De&s;ire of any other. In a Week's time his Stomach came, and his Thir&s;t abated; and after a Month's con&s;tantly Drinking, and <HI>Bathing every other Day</HI> a little while, only to &s;tretch his Joints, it gave him perfect Ea&s;e from Pain.</P>
<P>The 28th of <HI>May</HI> he return'd home, and carried &s;ome of the Waters along with him, and &s;ent for them con&s;tantly once a Week, u&s;ing them for his ordinary Drink, and &s;ome|times drinking them warm in the Morning for a Stool or two, as Occa&s;ion required, and
<PB N="29" REF="34">they pa&s;s'd very well, but not &s;o effectually as upon the Place. This Cour&s;e continued till the End of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1691, when he came to the <HI>Bath</HI> again, Drinking and <HI>Bathing</HI> as at the fir&s;t, till the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> with increa&s;|ing Succe&s;s; but towards that time he went home again, and &s;ent and continued to u&s;e the Waters as before.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Allhallowtide</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> the Gray Hairs began to fall off, and new ones &s;ucceeded; and by <HI>Candlemas</HI> they were all gone, and a brown, curling Hair came in their place, &s;uch as he had when he was about 20, growing &s;o fa&s;t, that he was oblig'd to cut above an Inch a Month, and &s;till growing thicker and fre&s;her, &s;o that he had a Head of Hair like a Wig, without a gray one in it.</P>

<P>He acquired likewi&s;e a fle&s;hy Habit of Body, and a ruddy and plump Face, and a lively vigorous Eye, and cou'd bend his Knees, and <HI>did not want other Effects or Powers of Youth:</HI> Nor had he any Fit of the Gout to lay him up, nor the lea&s;t Touch of the Stone, or any Sharpne&s;s of Urine, after he was once well enter'd into drinking of the <HI>Bath-Waters.</HI></P>

<P>One Morning, as a Servant of his was pa&s;|&s;ing through, his Bed-chamber, he call'd to her to reach him the Gallypot in which the <HI>Cordial Electuary</HI> was, out of his Clo&s;et, but &s;he through mi&s;take brought him the <HI>Pot of the Extract,</HI> and of which, as it happen'd, there were four Ounces, and he immediately took &s;ix Drachms of it, as appear'd upon weighing of what remained afterwards; &s;o that what he took contain'd about <HI>two Scru|ples and an half, or fifty Grains of</HI> pure <HI>Opium.</HI></P>
<P>After this he &s;lept four Hours, <HI>viz.</HI> from Eight to Twelve, before his Servants perceived any thing of the Mi&s;take, or attempted to wake him; but then they could not, tho' they did what they could, and therefore &s;ent immediately from <HI>Highgate,</HI> where his Lord|&s;hip then was, to Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> and Sir <HI>John Micklethwaite</HI> to come and attend him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Micklethwaite</HI> being abroad, Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> pre&s;crib'd divers Things, and had them made up ready, and a little while after|wards they met with Sir <HI>John,</HI> and by Five
<PB N="33" REF="40">in the Evening they were both of them with <HI>my Lord,</HI> at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Highgate.</HI> His Ser|vants in the mean time had been able to take him up, and put on his Cloaths, and to &s;up|port and a&s;&s;i&s;t him to walk about his Cham|ber, and he was &s;ometimes able to open his Eyes, and to an&s;wer to what was &s;poken, but fell a&s;leep again pre&s;ently, and they were not able to keep him awake a Quarter of a Mi|nute with all their Striving, calling upon him, <HI>giving him provoking Language,</HI> nor any thing el&s;e that they cou'd do.</P>
<P>He was therefore <HI>let Blood</HI> directly, and that plentifully, and then took <HI>Infu&s;ion. Croci Me|tallor.</HI> &ounce;i&s;s, and after that <HI>Vitrioli albi</HI> &dram;i, twice, but cou'd not vomit, neither did he ever vo|mit in the whole cour&s;e of his Life: How|ever the Medicines work'd downwards, and he had a Stool in about an Hour's time, and they then proceeded to give him a <HI>Draught</HI> of <HI>Decoct. Senn.</HI> &ounce;iv, with <HI>two Ounces of Syrupus de Spin&acirc;,</HI> and repeated the &s;ame &s;ort of Me|dicines every two or three Hours afterwards, and Sir <HI>John Micklethwait</HI> &s;eeing little or no Alteration for the better, return'd to <HI>London</HI> about Nine at Night, bewailing the apparent Lo&s;s of &s;o great a Man, &s;o good a Friend, and &s;o kind a Ma&s;ter; but Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> continued with him, and &s;till to give what A&s;&s;i&s;tance he cou'd, and about Midnight order'd <HI>my Lord</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="41">to be put to Bed, and to be &s;uffered to &s;leep without tho&s;e frequent Interruptions which had been hitherto given him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Purging Draughts</HI> continued to work plentifully, and as &s;oon as the Day began to appear, <HI>the Doctor</HI> walk'd down into the Garden to refre&s;h him&s;elf with the cool Air of the Morning, giving Orders to be call'd in half an Hour, or upon any Alteration which might happen to his Lord&s;hip, and about that time Notice was brought him that <HI>my Lord</HI> &s;eem'd to be more &s;en&s;ible, and was awake; upon which <HI>the Doctor</HI> went in again, and found his Pul&s;e not quite &s;o high as it had been before, and gave him a <HI>Cordial Draught,</HI> with 15 <HI>Drops of Spiritus Salis Armoniaci</HI> in it.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord</HI> being now not &s;o de&s;irous of Sleep as before, call'd for <HI>his Chaplain</HI> to read to him, and in half an Hour more his Head was clear, and he &s;eem'd to be totally reco|ver'd, and de&s;ired to &s;ee what had been or|der'd for him, and &s;poke of <HI>the Prae&s;criptions</HI> with a great deal of Candour and Rea&s;on, and Skill and Judgment.

<P>At length <HI>the Doctor</HI> thought of <HI>Ca&s;tile Soap,</HI> and gave him not a little, but from two or three Drachms <HI>to an Ounce,</HI> and <HI>an Ounce and an half,</HI> and to <HI>two and more Ounces</HI> at a time, di&s;&s;olv'd in Water, 'till he had taken two Pounds of it, and at la&s;t there came away <HI>a Stuff,</HI> and &s;ome Water followed.&mdash;This Stuff was &s;eparated, as <HI>the Doctor</HI> imagines, from the In&s;ide of the Ureter, and there came away <HI>a</HI> large <HI>Stone</HI> along with it, and wrapt up in it, be&s;ides &s;everal other &s;mall ones, and Dirt and Skin, and the gangren'd Membrane, <HI>and</HI> after that a <HI>foul and na&s;ty Urine,</HI> and then, <HI>viz.</HI> the next Day in the Morning, a great Quantity of Water.&mdash;What he took afterwards was <HI>Terebinthina Veneta,</HI> and other &s;oft and gentle Medicines of the &s;ame Tendency, and all was well.</P>

<P>This is a remarkable Account of a very happy Effect from the U&s;e of <HI>Soap,</HI> and an In&s;tance how free it may be made with, even to a Degree which is almo&s;t incredible.

<P>It is to be ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that the Effect which this Medicine had, was merely to bring away the Stuff, Stone, <HI>&amp;c.
