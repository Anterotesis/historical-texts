<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE PHYSIC alone among all the u&s;e|ful &s;ciences, has at this time the misfortune to be <HI>unrepre&s;ented</HI> in Parliament, and as the STATUTE <HI>for preventing Frauds and Abu&s;es in the making and vending un&s;ound, adulterate, and bad Drugs and Medicines;</HI> is now near expiring, I hope it may not be improper to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing that Act, and to offer &s;ome Amendments thereto, which the artful eva&s;ions and corruptions of mercenary artificers have rendered ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Your early acquaintance with the nature and con&s;titution of Parliaments, your weight in our national A&s;&s;embly, and your exten&s;ive benevolence, have pointed you out the fitte&s;t patron and advocate for a Scheme wholely calculated for the public Be|nefit, to correct the many enormous Abu&s;es in PHARMACY, and con&s;equently to promote the
<PB N="4" REF="4">health and temporal happine&s;s of a con&s;iderable part of mankind. Therefore I &s;hall venture, without any farther apology, to &s;ubmit the following lines to your &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>There is no well regulated country where the LEGISLATURE has not made &s;ome provi&s;ion for the pre&s;ervation of the health of the <HI>Body natural,</HI> as well as for that of the <HI>Body politic;</HI> yet pity it is, that in mo&s;t, for want of due Information, all the Laws hitherto enacted in regard to <HI>Medicine,</HI> have fallen far &s;hort of it's good intentions. For as an Evil who&s;e &s;ource or cau&s;e is unknown mu&s;t be remedile&s;s; &s;o is it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, that the Frauds or Abu&s;es in any art or trade, tho' ever &s;o pernicious to &s;ociety, can be prevented or puni&s;hed by law, until they are fir&s;t di&s;covered and made apparent to the law-givers.&mdash;If &s;ome of the hone&s;t arti&s;ts or trade&s;men of every occupation, would ingenuou&s;ly di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret corruptions of their re&s;pective callings (without which they may for ever e&s;cape the cognizance and cen&s;ure of the LEGISLATURE) we might then hope for a general reformation. But alas! we are too like the <HI>Ephe&s;ian &s;mith</HI> in &s;cripture, ready upon every attempt to purge us from iniquity, to cry out with him, <HI>The craft is in danger.</HI></P>
<P>The natural, fragile &s;tructure of the human Frame, which has rendered it &s;ubject to &s;undry inevitable vici&s;&s;itudes, from the force of external bodies, from the alterations of the air, the nature of the aliments, and from the very vital actions, has made the <HI>hecling art</HI> in general, of all others the mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and well-being of mankind, and nearly <HI>coaeval</HI> with the Creation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Boerh. In&s;tit. Medic. Prolegom.</NOTE>. So &s;en&s;ible were men in all ages of the u&s;efulne&s;s and dignity of Phy&s;ic, that it has ever been held in the utmo&s;t reverence and e&s;teem.
<PB N="5" REF="5">The inventors or improvers of this noble art were by the antients ranked among the Gods, and &s;tiled &s;ons of Gods, and the hands of Gods. It was a long time practi&s;ed by heroes only, or the &s;ons of Gods,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aelian de. animal. lib. ii. cap. 18.</NOTE> being deemed too &s;acred for prophane hands. The Heathen, Jews and primitive Chri&s;tians agreed in paying the utmo&s;t re&s;pect to the healing art, be|lieving it of divine and heavenly origine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cicer. Tu&s;culan. Quae&s;t. lib. 3. Hippoc. de pri&s;. medicina S. Aug. de Civit. Dei.</NOTE>. Hence we find the greate&s;t honors po&s;&s;ible were conferred on the antient phy&s;icians in the mo&s;t wi&s;e, polite, and politic &s;tates. They were generally care&s;&s;ed or en|vied by kings and princes who de&s;igned to &s;tudy, and endeavoured to acquire and practice their in|e&s;timable art. Many natural productions as well as artificial preparations to this day retain the Name of a royal di&s;coverer or inventor. And two<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Me&s;ue &amp; Avicen.</NOTE> of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable antient phy&s;ical writers who&s;e works are extant at this time, were, one the &s;on of a king, the other a &s;overeign prince. The <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;o ju&s;tly prized the worth and excellency of the divine <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> that they initiated him into their grand my&s;teries; they pre&s;ented him with the free|dom of <HI>Athens</HI> in a crown, (a royal diadem) to the value of a thou&s;and pieces of Gold, and &s;et|tled a con&s;iderable &s;tipend for his maintenance during life, at the public expence.&mdash;They likewi&s;e made a law prohibiting all women, bond&s;men, or &s;laves meddling with Phy&s;ic: as they did likewi&s;e in Locris, which decreed, that di&s;obedience to the directions or pre&s;criptions of Phy&s;icians &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> made all Phy&s;icians that &s;hould &s;ettle in <HI>Rome,</HI> freemen and denizens<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</NOTE>; and when, for &s;ome rea&s;ons of &s;tate, a &s;ucceeding emperor bani&s;hed the <HI>Greeks</HI> that city, yet the Phy&s;icians, tho' all <HI>Greeks,</HI> were exempted. It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable
<PB N="6" REF="6">that the fir&s;t alien known to obtain his freedom of that once glorious city was a Phy&s;ician<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arcagathus.</NOTE>. The Phy&s;icians of the college of <HI>Milan</HI> are dignified with an order of knighthood, and wear to this day golden Collars<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. Bapt. Sylvatic.</NOTE>. Innumerable other in&s;tances might be produced, if nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;hew, that <HI>medicine</HI> and the <HI>medical &s;ages</HI> were ever re&s;pected and e&s;teemed, admired and encouraged, all the World over. See <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> Senert. <HI>In&s;t. Med.</HI> Moaebii <HI>Synop&s;. epitom. In&s;t. Med.</HI> Le Clerc <HI>Hi&s;t. de la Medecine.</HI> Friend's <HI>Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ic.</HI> Harris's <HI>Pharmac-anti-empyr.</HI> and <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f. to</HI> Fuller<HI>'s Pharmacop. extemper.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>healing art</HI> was thus honored in the ruder, early ages, how much does it de&s;erve our regard and attention with the many con&s;iderable improve|ment of the moderns, which were to the antients utterly unknown?</P>
<P>There can hardly be any one in&s;en&s;ible of the value of HEALTH and LIFE, &s;ince the very fir&s;t impul&s;e of nature prompts every creature to u&s;e all ways and means to pre&s;erve them: And nothing but an uninterrupted enjoyment of health can render any man regardle&s;s of &s;o invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing. It was the dreadful contagion which raged in <HI>Rome</HI> about the 301&s;t year after the building that city, where there were not then found Phy&s;icians enough to attend the &s;ick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">carna&s;.</NOTE>, that fir&s;t made the robu&s;t <HI>Ro|mans</HI> &s;en&s;ible of the U&s;e and Excellency of PHYSIC, which they afterwards &s;o generou&s;ly incouraged, and &s;o amply rewarded. <HI>Salus populi &s;uprema lex e&s;to,</HI> is a precept which was once religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, in its fulle&s;t extent, by every worthy <HI>Roman</HI> &s;enator. And tho' it might not have been originally pro|nounced or received in this &s;en&s;e literally, yet I ap|prehend the application of it merely to the bodily
<PB N="7" REF="7">health of the people, can be no wide deviation from the &s;en&s;e of the wi&s;e author; &s;ince the general well|fare of the community depends upon the health of it's Members.</P>
<P>PHYSIC or MEDICINE is the art by which our lives and health are pre&s;erved and re&s;tored. And abu&s;es or mal-admini&s;tration in any branch thereof mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prejudice or &s;ubvert the whole. This cannot be charged upon <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> or <HI>Chirurgery,</HI> for it may in truth be affirmed, that this Kingdom was never &s;o happily provided in that way, as at pre&s;ent, with men of both profe&s;&s;ions inferior to none in <HI>Europe,</HI> in erudition, judgement, and probity. But PHARMACY, or the <HI>apothecary's art</HI> in parti|cular, which mini&s;ters in an e&s;pecial manner to the two former branches, namely <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Chirurgery;</HI> tho' the good &s;ucce&s;s of both mo&s;t con&s;iderably depends thereupon, is le&s;t neglected and un|cultivated, over-run with <HI>errors, abu&s;es</HI> and <HI>frauds.</HI> And tho' there are no corruptions in any art &s;o per|nicious and de&s;tructive to the public, as tho&s;e of <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> yet (melancholly con&s;ideration!) none are &s;o little liable to di&s;covery or puni&s;hment. Deceits in mo&s;t trades are perceptible to the gene|rality, and are not only in &s;ome &s;en&s;e cognizable by law, but as they mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be di&s;cover|ed by the cu&s;tomers, common policy will direct mo&s;t trade&s;men to &s;ome integrity in their callings. But as the mo&s;t baneful frauds in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> being never &s;u&s;pected, are &s;eldom or never perceptible to the public, tho' often felt, (few or none be&s;ides <HI>Phy&s;icians, Chirurgeons,</HI> or <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of the evils in this way,) &s;o none tran&s;gre&s;&s;es with more ca&s;e and &s;ecurity, than the di&s;hone&s;t apothe|cary. He may de&s;troy the reputation of the mo&s;t careful and judicious phy&s;icians and chirurgeons, and murder thou&s;ands of their patients, his bill is never|thele&s;s paid, and he is &s;till un&s;u&s;pectedly entertain|ed, care&s;&s;ed and employed by the &s;urviving Fami|lies.
<PB N="8" REF="8">A little artifice can tin&s;el or varni&s;h over the mo&s;t vile <HI>frauds</HI> or <HI>perfidious neglects</HI> of the <HI>unju&s;t apothecary.</HI> If he can command a brazen front, with an hardened, &s;ervile con&s;cience, it is enough, all is &s;afe. For his <HI>va&s;&s;al apprentices,</HI> who only can be privy to his villainy, are hu&s;hed, they are obliged to keep his <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> without di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>AS PHARMACY is a mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary art, nay, according to one of the fathers of phy&s;ic<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cel&s;us. See J. D. Hor&s;t. In&s;t. pharmac. L. ii. C. i.</NOTE>, <HI>the mo&s;t u&s;eful branch of medicine,</HI> when in a &s;tate of purity and perfection, &s;o it is the mo&s;t <HI>pernicious</HI> and <HI>de&s;tructive,</HI> when it is not exerci&s;ed with the utmo&s;t integrity, care, fidelity and good under|&s;tanding. No knave &s;o vile, &s;o dangerous to &s;ociety as a bad apothecary. The rapacious highwayman, a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>enemy</HI> to mankind, bids the unwary tra|veller &s;tand and at the peril of his life part with his money: But the di&s;hone&s;t apothecary, a more &s;ubtil kind of robber, pretends a <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> for his Cu&s;to|mer, yet takes the &s;ame opportunity with the former (which the love of life and health, and dread of death that human Nature is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, amply affords him,) and &s;o robs thou&s;ands of their fortunes, giving them only &s;ome vile, u&s;ele&s;s drug in ex|change; by which their lives are always endan|gered and often de&s;troyed. And yet notwith&s;tand|ing the apothecary is never in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected; &s;o that the orphan may oft pay him for the death of his parents, parents for that of their children, wi|dows for their husbands, and &s;o forth: and perhaps gratefully acknowledge the great care and tenderne&s;s of their <HI>worthy apothecary,</HI> tho' he might have been more in&s;trumental to their death than the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the apothecaries have no tem|poral advantages in, nor any incitements to hone&s;ty or integrity in their calling. For while men can buy the mo&s;t ba&s;e and wor&s;t commodities, and may
<PB N="9" REF="9">without detection, &s;ub&s;titute them for, or &s;ell them at the &s;ame rate with the be&s;t and mo&s;t genuine, we &s;hall probably be infe&s;ted with &s;uch mercenary wretches as will prefer their own ill-gotten gain, to a clear con&s;cience and the &s;afety and welfare of their neighbours; <HI>the far greater profit ari&s;ing from illegal trade.</HI></P>
<P>I would not be hereby thought to charge all the worthy apothecaries of this kingdom, with igno|rance, di&s;ingenuity, or di&s;integrity; far be it from me! I am well a&s;&s;ured that we have &s;ome, as ju|dicious, as &s;kilful, and as hone&s;t in their way, as any in <HI>Europe.</HI> But as it may not be allowable to point at the indentical guilty per&s;ons, either by naming the one, or exempting the other, &s;o I am obliged to make the charge in general again&s;t the whole fraternity, my &s;elf not excepted. So <HI>let him whom the cap fits wear it</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;pear's. Hamlet.</NOTE> let <HI>the galled jade wince.</HI>&mdash;It is thro' a real concern for the ju&s;t, good men, that are indi&s;criminately blended with the unju&s;t, and for the &s;candalous di&s;repute which the excellent art of <HI>Pharmacy</HI> is fallen into, toge|ther with the long train of evils which attend the public in general, from the ba&s;e craft and corrupti|on of avaricious fal&s;ifiers of medicines, that I am urged to this work.</P>
<P>I have a long time had a conflict with my&s;elf about this important undertaking. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;ome time feared the united powers of the wicked a|gain&s;t me, having on the like occa&s;ion heretofore, fatally experienced the &s;trength of the <HI>confederate Opponents of reformation:</HI> And above all, I avoided taking upon me a task, to which I am con&s;cious of, and confe&s;s my inequality. But at length laying a|&s;ide all &s;elfi&s;h fear, and finding none of the many more capable inclined to engage in &s;uch a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>warfare,</HI> I have at all hazards pre&s;umed
<PB N="10" REF="10">to give you the following informations, and to &s;ub|mit the&s;e ju&s;t (tho' indige&s;ted) Ob&s;ervations to the wi&s;dom of the LEGISLATURE; from who&s;e pater|nal care and benevolence alone, we may expect the due encouragement of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Vice</HI> of every kind.

<P>The extraordinary, unlimited gain ari&s;ing from the&s;e horrid u&s;urpations, has now tempted the apo|thecaries utterly to for&s;ake their proper and imme|diate office and duty. For in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the true means of learning <HI>pharmacy,</HI> (reading the Works of the celebrated writers upon that &s;ubject, &s;uch being generally in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin,</HI> languages to which mo&s;t dealers in drugs are entire &s;trangers,) they have totally neglected and for&s;aken it, and in the room of &s;uch authors furni&s;hed them&s;elves with only &s;ome vile <HI>Engli&s;h di&s;pen&s;atory,</HI> the de&s;picable <HI>cob-webs</HI> of &s;ome poor illiterate wretch, who quacked for a livelihood and &s;pun the&s;e paultry traps for ig|norant, unwary <HI>Flies.</HI> Such were the memorable <HI>&s;tar-mongers</HI> and voluminous <HI>quacks, Culpeper</HI> and <HI>Salmon,</HI> and the erroneous, conceited <HI>&s;criblers, Quincy</HI> and <HI>Alleyne;</HI> who&s;e <HI>di&s;pen&s;atories, practices of phy&s;ic,</HI> and other &s;uch like fallacious <HI>quack-books,</HI> (which will not bear reading by any that have read the originals, being calculated only for &s;uch mean, illiterate reptiles, as addict them&s;elves to that vile, pernicious Trade of quacking,) can but prompt a man to think he under&s;tands phy&s;ic, and practi&s;e it, when a better education mu&s;t convince him of the
<PB N="25" REF="25">contrary, and make him tremble at the thoughts of the &s;tupendous task.</P>
<P>Thus has <HI>Pharmacy</HI> been <HI>perverted</HI> and <HI>deba&s;ed.</HI> For tho' held by the antients <HI>in the &s;econd rank,</HI> yet is it now deemed the <HI>la&s;t</HI> and <HI>meane&s;t</HI> of the three branches; and indeed under the pre&s;ent mi&s;manage|ment and depravity, it may of all trades be reckoned the vile&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;picable; and in&s;tead of being u&s;eful, it is become apparently de&s;tructive to &s;ociety. A footman or porter may now a-days pa&s;s for an apothecary, we &s;ee &s;hops daily &s;erved and attended by &s;uch, or ignorant women. I have known an apothecary's &s;hop &s;erved by a journey man of a cer|tain mean mechanic trade, who knew not a letter in the alphabet. Nay, a wretch who conver&s;ed more with brutes than men; the &s;table-tender or groom of a certain eminent apothecary, has been exalted from rubbing of hor&s;es heels, to attending his ma&s;ter's table, and thence to wiping of compters and pounding mortars; and being tran&s;lated from his ma&s;ter's to a &s;hop of his own, acquired &s;o much craft as to pa&s;s for an apothecary, lived in repute among his neighbours for many years, and died not long &s;ince in very con&s;iderable circum&s;tances. Hence the calling is become &s;o vile and &s;candalous, that few, be&s;ides the meaner &s;ort, put their children to learn it, and &s;o contemptible are tho&s;e after a mo&s;t &s;ervile and tedious apprentice&s;hip, that a journeyman taylor, or &s;hoemaker, or any of the meane&s;t handy-craft trades, &s;hall get better wages than a journey man apothecary, of ever &s;o good un|der&s;tanding in his profe&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t ignorant being capable of &s;erving mo&s;t of our common &s;hops, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in retailing medicines made up by a <HI>nominal druggi&s;t,</HI> as incapable of preparing, as an <HI>apothecary</HI> of <HI>pre&s;cribing</HI> them ju&s;tly; or bought from a poor, ignorant herb-gatherer, who both frequently &s;ell one thing for another of ever &s;o dif|ferent qualities, which impo&s;itions are implicitly
<PB N="26" REF="26">over-looked by ma&s;ter and man; neither thinking the knowledge of &s;imple or compound medicines material, or nece&s;&s;ary, nor their preparation or compo&s;ition his proper occupation, they lay them|&s;elves out for practi&s;ing phy&s;ic and chirurgery; for which as well as their own profe&s;&s;ion, the reading a fal&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h di&s;pen&s;atory</HI> is reckoned a &s;ufficient qua|lification. So, quacking being the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>modern apothecary,</HI> he generally goes thro' that him&s;elf, therefore needs no judicious <HI>emanuen&s;is,</HI> any raw-boy being &s;oon made capable of the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;hop; for which rea&s;on, rather than pay journeyman's wages, apprentices are multiplied at any rate, and at all hazards. Whence we come to have more apothecaries' <HI>&s;hops</HI> than any city in <HI>Europe</HI> in proportion: We are within eight or ten equal in number with tho&s;e of <HI>Paris,</HI> which I think is allowed to be &s;ix times as populous as <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>But this fatal degeneracy has now made &s;uch a progre&s;s, that we really forget or know not what we &s;hould be. For regardle&s;s of the worth and dignity of our art and of the public benefit, the apothecaries have neglected and abandoned it, and in the vain pur&s;uit of another, (like <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s dog) <HI>quitted the real &s;ub&s;tance for an empty &s;hadow;</HI> &s;o, lo&s;ing their art, have dwindled into vile, fallacious quacks, vain and audacious pretenders to phy&s;ic and chirurgery, and de&s;tructive hawkers of medicine.

<P>Let us now take a further view of &s;uch an apo|thecary and &s;ee how he can teach pharmacy.</P>
<P>The apprentice of <HI>&s;uch a ma&s;ter,</HI> begins with a &s;mall &s;mattering of grammar rules, and &s;ometimes none; which he (lea&s;t <HI>Tyro</HI> &s;hould &s;oon di&s;cover his ignorance and illiterature, or in time out do him) judges &s;ufficient. His fund of &s;en&s;e, genius, or o|ther abilities, are never con&s;idered, being indeed but trifling to a <HI>modern Apothecary,</HI> for a little acquired craft may make a mere block-head, or even an <HI>I|deot,</HI> pa&s;s for an <HI>Apothecary.</HI> His apprentice&s;hip com|mences, with the &s;ervile drudgery of the mo&s;t abject &s;lave; as for in&s;truction of any kind he mu&s;t not expect it, his ma&s;ter, who &s;hines among his nur&s;e-keepers and co-equals, had none: So that to learn his trade, the only pro&s;pect left, is to follow the good example of ma&s;ter, which in this in&s;tance is not at|tended with much difficulty, and therefore requires but few documents. For altho' he deigns to &s;uffer his va&s;&s;al to make up &s;ome few phy&s;icians pre&s;crip|tions, (out of pure complai&s;ance to the elder bro|thers of the faculty of phy&s;ic, or in&s;uperable love of

Thus is he to learn his future occupation!</P>
<P>At length the &s;lavi&s;h apprentice&s;hip ended, the mi|&s;erable, unedi&s;ied drudge of a vile quack is now be|come a ma&s;ter. &mdash;Of what?&mdash;Why of a &s;hop only for&s;ooth.&mdash;See him already by example, if not by precept, thorough paced, not only in the little mean in&s;inuating artifices and tricks of quacks and ordinary <HI>haberda&s;hers of drugs;</HI> but likewi&s;e imbued with the ba&s;e penury and &s;ordid craft of pinching on the one hand the indu&s;trious wretch, who for want of better employment &s;eeks a mi&s;erable livelihood, by gather|ing the herbs or reptiles of the earth, and extorting on the other, an exorbitant profit from the pitiful farthing of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous.

<P>Thus admirably equipped with craft and artifice, and with impudence and a&s;&s;urance, (the in&s;eparable attendants of ignorance) this <HI>mon&s;trous, amphibious animal, this wretched cebler in medicine,</HI> who has not in reality a &s;ingle qualification for a <HI>phy&s;ician</HI> or <HI>chirurgeon,</HI> nor perhaps even for an <HI>apothecary,</HI> vainly pretends to the knowledge of the <HI>three,</HI> and &s;o takes upon him the &s;ole care and management of the &s;ick in all di&s;tempers and di&s;orders; <HI>acute</HI> or <HI>chronic, phy&s;ical</HI> or <HI>chirurgical</HI> ca&s;es are all alike to him, well knowing that <HI>his incapacity is not obvious to the unhappy parties concerned!</HI> he hardily per&s;i&s;ts in his malpractices, being blinded with <HI>ignorance,</HI> prompted by <HI>avarice,</HI> and having his con&s;cience hardened by an early contracted <HI>habit of iniquity,</HI> till he has rendered the unhappy <HI>&s;ufferers</HI> immedica|ble; and then (&s;eldom or never before) permits a phy&s;ician or chirurgeon to be called in; or rather, if he can, brings in &s;ome <HI>poor pretender</HI> to, or <HI>mercena|ry tool</HI> of, either profe&s;&s;ion, to ju&s;tify his apparent mi&s;conduct, or to take the honor of giving the tor|tured <HI>&s;ufferer</HI> the <HI>Coup de Grace.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall beg leave to give one melancholy in&s;tance of this kind our of many. A certain unfortunate man, who too much confided in the boa&s;ted &s;kill of a bold pre&s;umptuous quack, committed him&s;elf to his care for a certain, &s;light, &s;ecret di&s;order: The apothecary judging it the only way to make a penny of the patient, proceeded to admini&s;ter medicines <HI>by whole&s;ale.</HI> For within the compa&s;s of three months he gave him above forty do&s;es of mercurial phy&s;ic, with &s;undry other co&s;tly drenches, which brought a con&s;iderable flux of humors upon the af|fected part: to which he then made divers unctuous
<PB N="33" REF="33">applications, till at length it became cancerous. La&s;tly he had recour&s;e to &s;alivation, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s, the patient grew &s;en&s;ibly wor&s;e: Yet the Quack to di&s;pel the growing doubts and &s;u&s;pici|ons of the poor abu&s;ed man, called in a <HI>reputed phy|&s;ician,</HI> to ju&s;tify his mal-practice, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the cure. The <HI>doctor</HI> being unable to &s;atisfy the unhappy &s;ufferer in his di&s;tru&s;t of the <HI>quack,</HI> he call|ed in better a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and had his life with great difficulty &s;aved, by the amputation of the di&s;tem|pered member. Notwith&s;tanding all this gro&s;s abu&s;e of the mi&s;erable patient, this unworthy apo|thecary, who may be pre&s;umed to be the principal cau&s;e of the greate&s;t evil attending this ca&s;e, makes a mo&s;t extravagant large bill, with a charge of <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> to his coadjutor the doctor, annexed.</P>
<P>By the&s;e and &s;uch like unnatural tran&s;gre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ons, is the <HI>apothecary</HI> led out of the way of his du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and bred an utter &s;tranger to all parts of his proper calling. By this vile craft he gets his bread, no wonder then he &s;hould be firmly attached to it. This is all he learns, all he knows, all he practi&s;es, all he teaches: And this he finds &s;ufficient to re|commend him: He indeed generally takes care to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in &s;ome <HI>party</HI> or <HI>club,</HI> whether <HI>religious</HI> or <HI>politic,</HI> no matter with how little <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> provided he e&s;pou&s;es and defends their principles with a good &s;tock of <HI>blind zeal and violence,</HI> he is &s;ure of the <HI>Society's</HI> favour, &s;o he may &s;ecurely neglect his <HI>true profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> He therefore employs his whole time in quacking or &s;troling over the town in que&s;t of prey. For to avoid the dangerous imputation of having nothing to do, <HI>no practice,</HI> (as the phra&s;e is,) he mu&s;t never be found at home; not to be &s;een in his noi&s;ome &s;hop except by accident to pre&s;cribe for &s;ome &s;udden emergency, or perhaps &s;ometimes to edify by reading over his own <HI>ill-cho&s;en, &s;tolen re|cipe's,</HI> there carefully filed more for <HI>&s;hew</HI> than <HI>u&s;e:</HI> That done, he mu&s;t hurry forth, and ru&s;h thro'
<PB N="34" REF="34">the &s;treets as if he had &s;o many calls, that he cannot tell which fir&s;t to an&s;wer: While the principal part of his bu&s;ine&s;s, furni&s;hing the &s;hop and &s;erving the <HI>wretched cu&s;tomers,</HI> is left to &s;ome mercenary <HI>&s;ham|druggi&s;t, a mi&s;erable herb-gatherer, and a raw appren|tice.</HI> The very <HI>Druggi&s;t,</HI> who in all other nations in <HI>Europe</HI> is but <HI>Pharmacopela,</HI> a mere drug-mer|chant, is with us, not only a <HI>phy&s;ician and chirurgeon,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>a Galenic and Chemic apothecary; a &s;eller of druggs, medicines, vernices, oils, paints or colours, poy&s;ons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>a Jack of all trades,</HI> and in truth, <HI>ma|&s;ter of none</HI>&mdash;For bad as the u&s;ual education of an apothecary may be, if it could be yet wor&s;e, he may make a good modern druggi&s;t enough. And it is demon&s;trable, that, among the many who a&s;&s;ume that name, there are not above two in <HI>Dub|lin</HI> that have any right to it. The&s;e who are, if po&s;&s;ible, wor&s;e quacks than the apothecaries, and generally wor&s;e qualified in every re&s;pect, were the fir&s;t who introduced that blacke&s;t villainy of &s;ophi|&s;ticating, and deba&s;ing of medicines to gain fame and applau&s;e by under&s;elling their hone&s;t brethren; and you &s;hall now find mo&s;t of them ready to make up the pre&s;criptions of phy&s;icians and chirurgeons, brought to them by the ignorant vulgar, (who alone indeed intru&s;t them with &s;uch,) at any rate they are offered, even tho' they cannot read them, and tho' they may be compo&s;ed of &s;undry medicaments to them utterly unknown. How mu&s;t the unhappy patient and pre&s;criber &s;uffer, who&s;e pre&s;criptions fall into &s;uch unworthy hands?</P>
<P>Thus wretchedly is <HI>pharmacy</HI> taught and practi&s;ed now a-days. How foreign to the manner of the <HI>antient, true apothecaries,</HI> is, I hope, evident from the foregoing; and how contradictory to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and common &s;en&s;e, is, I believe, to every rational unprejudiced man, obvious. Yet, that under the pre|&s;ent fatal mi&s;management, it is, and mu&s;t continue &s;o, is, I think, mo&s;t demon&s;trable. For a man who
<PB N="35" REF="35">takes the greate&s;t pains to learn that art, and acquires the mo&s;t extraordinary knowledge, and all the requi&s;ite qualifications therein, and ever &s;o &s;trict|ly, and diligently attends to the <HI>vegular calls</HI> of his profe&s;&s;ion, and di&s;charges the <HI>duty,</HI> and <HI>proper office</HI> of an <HI>apothecary,</HI> if he does not mo&s;t audaciou&s;ly and adventurou&s;ly, quack in all ca&s;es without di&s;|tinction, he is &s;urely deemed but a <HI>blockhead,</HI> and may remain to the generality unknown, and &s;tarve: or perhaps have the comfort of being reputed, in his narrow circle of acquaintance, <HI>a good, hone&s;t fellow, but no apothecary;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>no quack;</HI> and is therefore de&s;pi&s;ed, becau&s;e, he has the candor and integrity, not to intermeddle with any bu&s;ine&s;s, but his own, nor to attempt things beyond his &s;phere. In &s;hort it is not &s;uch a man that is <HI>with us</HI> deemed an <HI>apothecary,</HI> no, it is the mo&s;t de&s;pica|ble of all human beings, a wretch ignorant of all arts, yet pretending to the greate&s;t; a fal&s;e, di&s;|&s;embling &s;ycophant, that poor, &s;hallow mimick, or untowardly ape of a phy&s;ician, chirurgeon and apo|thecary, the vile, deluding quack! Where then is the encouragement to excel in this art, when the mo&s;t ignorant of it, are, by the generality, preferred, and mo&s;t e&s;teemed?</P>
<P>I am well apprized that the&s;e will appear &s;trange innovations to &s;ome of the brethren, as well as to tho&s;e who have not only let the <HI>pretended apothe|caries</HI> into the &s;ecrets of their families, but al&s;o In|di&s;creetly committed the care of their health and lives, into &s;uch unworthy hands, and &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be blindly, and implicitly governed by them. Yet even tho&s;e upon impartial examination, and &s;erious con&s;ideration, will find them literally ju&s;t and true. It requires no great depth of &s;aga|city to &s;ound the&s;e ambitious pretenders, and to find how unfit and incapable they are, to practice the profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e name they unde&s;ervedly bear, and how much more that of phy&s;ic and chirurgery.
<PB N="36" REF="36">How many are there among us &s;o palpably ignorant, in a mo&s;t material branch of their profe&s;&s;ed art, as to be daily impo&s;ed upon, not only by their drug|gi&s;t, but even by the &s;imple herb-gatherer, who both frequently impo&s;e upon them, one thing for another, tho' ever &s;o different in their nature and properties? Is it not notorious, that <HI>thap&s;ia</HI> or deadly carrot, for turpeth, gout-wort, or herb gerard, for ma&s;ter-wort, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> black maidenhair, for the black and true maidenhairs, &s;purious germander, for ground-pine, burnet, for &s;axifrage, male fern, for o&s;mond-royal, fig-wort, for &s;olomon's &s;eal, wall|pepper or &s;tone crop, for &s;mall hou&s;eleek, cypre&s;s for &s;avin, &s;tinking black horehound, for the white, bugle, for betony, and many &s;uch like pernicious impo&s;tures, are daily palmed upon the <HI>ignorant a|pothecaries,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t apparent di&s;parity in their outward appearance, as well as in their virtues and effects?

Did not two apothecaries of &s;ome emi|nence, in the year 1739, adverti&s;e Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s <HI>medicines,</HI> for &s;ale, long before the materials could po&s;&s;ibly be had, or prepared? and did not the&s;e worthy brethren afterwards employ a certain, aban|doned, infamous quack, (once well known <HI>to watch|wen, and mid-night magi&s;trates, to bailiffs, proctors,
<PB N="37" REF="37">church-wardens,</HI> &amp;c.) to vilify him, <HI>whom they only &s;u&s;pected,</HI> to have detected their abominable deceit? In charity, I hope, and am willing to believe, all this, and more, the effects of pure, confirmed igno|rance; which, tho' equally pernicious with de&s;ign, there is not at pre&s;ent the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of re|moving: For &s;ince it is not worth while to &s;pend any time or pains, to learn a di&s;regarded profe&s;&s;ion, by which &s;o little profit is to be gained, as by <HI>true Pharmacy,</HI> (the bare name being enough <HI>to garni&s;h the quack,</HI> nay, <HI>to dub him a doctor in his own, and the vulgar eyes,</HI>) it can hardly be otherwi&s;e expected, as the livelihood of mo&s;t apothecaries, now a-days, depends upon their hawking about and quacking with &s;uch of their weak, unguarded neighbours, as &s;uffer them&s;elves to fall a prey to their perfidious craft and avarice.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t wonderful, and to tho&s;e who are not thoroughly acquainted with the proper office and duty of an apothecary, inconceivable, what an ab|ject &s;tate of depravity and degeneracy the apothe|caries of this age are fallen into; and &s;uch in time mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of phy&s;ic al&s;o, from the nece&s;&s;ary mutual connection of each art, with the other: But moreover, it cannot be long worth any man's while to &s;pend <HI>the be&s;t part of his life, and much of his fortune,</HI> in tedious, laborious &s;tudies, deep and accurate re&s;earches, into the mo&s;t hidden, and re|mote rece&s;&s;es of nature, when no di&s;tinction is made between him, and &s;o ba&s;e a pretender to phy&s;ic, as an illiterate, unbred apothecary; more e&s;pecially when it is in the power of &s;uch, to prevent his doing the good he &s;eeks in his profe&s;&s;ion, to elude his be&s;t skill, and fru&s;trate all his hopes and intentions of cure, by ignorance, di&s;hone&s;ty, or neglect, which mu&s;t &s;oon bring him, and the whole art, into the ut|mo&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>But it is yet more &s;urpri&s;ing, that the&s;e very men &s;hould &s;o far have deceived the public, as to have
<PB N="38" REF="38">their pernicious quacking and tampering, with the health and lives of the people, &s;till countenanced by many per&s;ons (in other re&s;pects) of good &s;en&s;e, and &s;ome of the be&s;t families.

But if none other evil had aro&s;e from the taking apothecaries from their occupation, and encouraging them to quack, and thereby to neglect their immediate office and duty, than &s;ubjecting the public to the grievous tax, of con&s;uming as much of the apothecaries drugs, and at &s;uch a rate, as
<PB N="40" REF="40">they think proper, methinks that &s;hould have deterred men from it &s;ufficiently.

If any man is con&s;cious of his knowledge, or capacity in medicine, he may pre&s;ent him&s;elf to the college of phy&s;icians, and &s;ue for a licence to practi&s;e, which, having an&s;wered the proper exami|tions, they are obliged to grant, they cannot refu&s;e: So that an apothecary, or any other per&s;on, found duly qualified, may obtain a licence, to practi&s;e phy&s;ic: But we find none of our apothecaries have, in any
<PB N="43" REF="43">in&s;tance, legally qualified them&s;elves for &s;uch a weighty undertaking, mo&s;t contenting them&s;elves with no better a <HI>Diploma</HI> than <HI>a &s;hop, garni&s;hed with &s;undry empty, painted, and labelled ve&s;&s;els,</HI> with it's windows <HI>adorned with mon&s;trous, or &s;trange, u&s;ele&s;s animals,</HI> as <HI>tortoi&s;es, toads,</HI> &amp;c. how then are they to be tru&s;ted in matters of &s;uch importance? Are they not rather to be indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided, and ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;ed?</P>
<P>To attain to a competent knowlege in <HI>pharmacy,</HI> and afterwards to di&s;charge the <HI>office,</HI> ju&s;tly and faithfully, mu&s;t require more time than <HI>apothecaries</HI> can properly &s;pare, who attempt arts, for which they have laid no &s;ort of foundation: And as none of them, have performed any of the requi&s;ites for <HI>a phy&s;ician,</HI> or <HI>chirurgeon,</HI> and few, or none, even tho&s;e for an <HI>apothecary,</HI> I think it as arrogant, and as impudent in <HI>an apothecary,</HI> to pre&s;ume, to prac|ti&s;e <HI>phy&s;ic</HI> or <HI>chirurgery,</HI> or to pretend to any skill or judgement in either, as it would be in the mo&s;t illiterate <HI>printer or book&s;eller,</HI> to pretend to the <HI>Ma|thematics,</HI> or any other branch of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> or <HI>Li|terature,</HI> merely becau&s;e he printed &s;undry learned books, in the&s;e &s;ciences, for &s;ale; or, for <HI>a color|grinder,</HI> (to u&s;e <HI>Mandeville</HI>'s words,) to <HI>painting,</HI> only becau&s;e he grinds the &s;everal colors, and per|haps prepares the pallate and pencils for his ma&s;ter, and &s;ees him frequently paint. The <HI>apothecary,</HI> it is true, may frequently &s;ee patients in all manner of di&s;tempers and di&s;orders, hear and &s;ee the mo&s;t judici|ous <HI>phy&s;icians</HI> and <HI>chirurgeons,</HI> accurately examine their various complaints, may peru&s;e their &s;everal pre|&s;criptions, nay prepare and admini&s;ter them. The <HI>printer</HI> likewi&s;e may &s;ee the be&s;t manu&s;cripts of the mo&s;t celebrated authors in all branches of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> may print and reprint them, and have thou&s;ands of impre&s;&s;ions to di&s;po&s;e of: And the <HI>color-grinder</HI> al&s;o, may daily &s;ee his <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> execute his be&s;t skill and mo&s;t &s;ublime de&s;igns in <HI>drawing,</HI> and may (by
<PB N="44" REF="44">his directions) make up and lay out in due order up|on the pallate, the &s;everal proper colors, and al&s;o provide the &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary pencils and tools for <HI>painting</HI> the &s;ame. And yet, notwith&s;tanding, each mu&s;t probably remain in the darke&s;t ignorance, and continue utter &s;trangers to <HI>phy&s;ic, philo&s;ophy,</HI> and <HI>painting,</HI> until regularly initiated into the <HI>rudiments,</HI> and duly and methodically in&s;tructed in the <HI>&s;everal rules</HI> of the re&s;pective arts; and all that &s;uch may be &s;aid to know in them, are a few technical words, learned by rote or accident, which can &s;erve only to impo&s;e upon the ignorant. The&s;e <HI>impo&s;tors,</HI> it is certain, may &s;hine among their kind, and even de|ceive men of &s;en&s;e and learning in other matters for a while, but they can never &s;tand the te&s;t of proper judges. Happy indeed, were it for the public, had the <HI>pretenders</HI> to the&s;e three arts, been equally con|&s;picuous to the world. If &s;o, it is more than pro|bable, there would be more <HI>botches</HI> ob&s;erved in the practice of the pretenders to phy&s;ic and chirurgery, (to &s;ay nothing of downright <HI>murders,</HI> which are u&s;ually hid by the friendly grave-digger) than there are to be &s;een in the <HI>nocturnal works</HI> of the printers of <HI>la&s;t &s;peeches</HI> and ballads, or in the vile, in&s;ignifi|cant daubings of the <HI>pretenders</HI> to painting on the paltry &s;igns in all the &s;treets in town.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>cheapne&s;s of the advice of apothecaries</HI> in <HI>phy&s;ic or chirurgery,</HI> it is a mo&s;t fal&s;e and deceitful in&s;inuation. It's value will be&s;t appear by con|&s;idering their qualification. If it appears they have none, as I think it mu&s;t, what is their advice worth? Should it not be avoided as a pe&s;t? I know it is objected by &s;ome, and made a handle by quacks, <HI>that the fees of phy&s;icians and chirurgeons are too high,</HI> and <HI>that people in low life, cannot purcha&s;e their atten|dance or advice.</HI> I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered the&s;e objections already,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 31.</NOTE> I &s;hall endeavour to obviate them further. It is true, there is no nation in the world
<PB N="45" REF="45">at this time, that &s;o ju&s;tly prizes the merits of phy&s;i|cians and chirurgeons, or &s;o nobly rewards both, as <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> For from our natural freedom, no re&s;traint has been laid on rewarding ju&s;t de&s;erts in any in&s;tance. Yet notwith&s;tanding, there are no people in <HI>Europe,</HI> even where fees are lowe&s;t, that may be better attended than tho&s;e of the&s;e Kingdoms, did not officious, &s;elfi&s;h quacks inter|fere.</P>
<P>There is no &s;et of men, who de&s;erve better of the public, than phy&s;icians and chirurgeons; none have been and are more publicly and privately beneficent. The extraordinary munificence of Dr. <HI>Radcliffe,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> of our Sir <HI>Patrick Dun,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Stevens;</HI> with many others, are mo|numents which mu&s;t atte&s;t this truth to futurity. And I can affirm on the other hand, that I never met with an object &s;o de&s;picable, that could not com|mand the advice and attendance of numbers of phy|&s;icians, and chirurgeons of the fir&s;t rank, upon its own terms: And that I have often known phy&s;ici|ans to refu&s;e fees from trade&s;men of good circum|&s;tances, and yet attend them con&s;tantly for many days after, without any other obligation that that of humanity. Is not this much better than to be &s;ub|ject to pay rigorou&s;ly the &s;maller fees, and to have the bodies liable to be detained, dead or alive, for payment; as we hear it is in &s;ome neighbouring na|tions? Our poor have no rea&s;on to complain in this in&s;tance, of any thing mere than the oppre&s;&s;ion of quacks. The hou&s;es of our phy&s;icians and chirur|geons are open to, and they are as ready to &s;uccour, the poor &s;ick as the opulent. Are not our <HI>Infirmary</HI> and <HI>Ho&s;pitals</HI> attended <HI>gratis?</HI>&mdash; It were well for apothecaries, as well as chirurgeons in low life, that none but real objects could partake of the&s;e Chari|ties.&mdash;</P>

<P N="3">III. I now come to my third head, namely, to lay open &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable frauds and abu&s;es of apothecaries and druggi&s;ts, and to point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t pernicious <HI>&s;ophi&s;tications</HI> of <HI>me|dicines,</HI> with the evil con&s;equences thereof.</P>
<P>It is commonly &s;aid, <HI>that phy&s;icians and apothecaries kill more than they cure.</HI>&mdash;However ludicrous or &s;atyri|cal this phra&s;e may &s;ound, it is a melancholy con|&s;ideration, that the ill-natured &s;arca&s;m often proves ju&s;t, and is likely to continue &s;o, until the <HI>apotheca|ries and druggi&s;ts,</HI> are brought under &s;ome proper regulations, which may re&s;train them from <HI>hawking</HI> and <HI>quacking,</HI> and confine them within the ju&s;t limits of their <HI>re&s;pective callings.</HI> For into &s;uch an aby&s;s of depravity and degeneracy, are the&s;e men fallen, by their gra&s;ping at matters beyond their &s;phere; that now (thro' ignorance or di&s;hone&s;ty) there is &s;carce a medicine of any worth to be had genuine; the knowledge of many of the mo&s;t valuable &s;imples is utterly lo&s;t, and in their room, &s;ome vile and fo|reign counterfeit, as quacks for apothecaries, foi&s;ted upon the unwary Public. <HI>For corruption by long impunity hardens the offenders, multiplies the number of the guilty, and is now &s;o far from being deemed &s;canda|lous</HI> in this way, <HI>that it is really become fa&s;hion|able.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed to wilful errors, it may not be impertinent, fir&s;t, to expo&s;e &s;ome ari&s;ing from the ignorance and illiterature of apothecaries, being probably the principal cau&s;es of many more, and which may produce as evil con&s;equences as any o|thers.</P>
<P>The works of the mo&s;t authentic medical writers, are in <HI>Arabic, Greek,</HI> or <HI>Latin.</HI> The be&s;t known names of di&s;tempers, as well as of medicines, the <HI>ex|otic druggs</HI> e&s;pecially, are in the&s;e or &s;ome other <HI>fo|reign Languages,</HI> often <HI>compound;</HI> and mo&s;t of the technical words in medicine, are al&s;o <HI>compound,</HI> tho' mo&s;tly of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> We do not as yet
<PB N="47" REF="47">know an <HI>Engli&s;h name</HI> for one vegetable in twenty. For as phy&s;ic took it's origin in the ea&s;tern parts of the world, and is not as yet truly naturalized to our tongue and idiom; it has hitherto been found &s;o un|certain and difficult, to reduce the <HI>terms of art,</HI> and <HI>names of medicaments,</HI> into any other tongue than the <HI>Latin,</HI> properly and expre&s;&s;ively, that all the colleges of phy&s;icians in <HI>Europe,</HI> have not only been obliged to give their di&s;pen&s;atories in <HI>Latin,</HI> but in many to admit an entire <HI>Greek</HI> word or phra&s;e, as being lea&s;t ambiguous, mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and &s;ignifi|cant. And this is the principal Rea&s;on for writing, extemporaneous pre&s;criptions al&s;o in <HI>Latin.</HI> This made it nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>apothecaries</HI> to under&s;tand the learned languages; and they were in all ages &s;en&s;i|ble of it; until of late, &s;ome <HI>hirelings</HI> &s;prang up, who, finding what a propen&s;ity people had to <HI>quack|cry;</HI> judged they might &s;cribble that way for the vulgar, to gain a livelihood, and &s;o pre&s;umed to tran&s;late the works of the learned in phy&s;ic, into the vulgar tongue; which <HI>fal&s;e, pretended trannslations,</HI> being &s;eldom or never read by any that under&s;tand the originals, have pa&s;&s;ed with their manifold errors unob&s;erved to this Day. Among the&s;e erroneous, hackney tran&s;lators, the mo&s;t celebrated among the apothecaries at pre&s;ent, I may &s;ay the mo&s;t in fa&s;hi|on, is the late famous Dr. <HI>Quincy,</HI> a <HI>Quondam apo|thecary</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> Who it is &s;aid <HI>wrote for bread in a Jail.</HI> What right he might have had to annex <HI>M. D.</HI> to his name, I have not yet been able to learn with any certainty; unle&s;s he followed the good ex|ample of his worthy predece&s;&s;or <HI>Salmon,</HI> who, being called to account for putting the&s;e letters after his name, upon the &s;pecious title pages of his many volumes of ful&s;ome fal&s;hood and non&s;en&s;e, it is &s;aid, <HI>declared he did not mean them for Medicinae Doc|tor, but for Medicamentorum Donator.</HI> In which &s;en&s;e Mr. <HI>Quincy,</HI> and every other <HI>apothecary,</HI> has, no doubt, without leave of an Univer&s;ity, a right to u&s;e them.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="48">
<P>The ignorance of the pre&s;ent &s;et of apothecaries, and their unacquaintance with the learned languages, puts them under a nece&s;&s;ity, in&s;tead of ob&s;erving the original <HI>London</HI> Di&s;pen&s;atory, and preparing and di&s;|pen&s;ing their medicines thereby, as the KING'S <HI>Proclamation prefixed to it enjoins,</HI> to u&s;e a &s;purious tran&s;lation of that Di&s;pen&s;atory by the afore&s;aid <HI>Quincy;</HI> in which he has committed the mo&s;t gro&s;s and dangerous mi&s;takes.

He has rendered <HI>&s;e&s;quiunciam,</HI> one ounce and an half, <HI>half an ounce,</HI> even in a compo&s;ition, wherein there are above &s;ix pounds &s;terling difference in the <HI>expence</HI> of that medicine, when di&s;pen&s;ed by the Di&s;pen&s;atory, and the &s;ame done by his tran&s;lation; be&s;ides the <HI>virtue</HI> of the remedy's being abated in proportion to what is omitted of the principal ingredient. The &s;ame author leaves out &s;everal things pre&s;cribed by the College Di&s;pen&s;atory, in many compo&s;itions, o|mits directing the &s;everal parts of &s;imples thereby directed to be u&s;ed, and in &s;hort, commits many unpardonable errors and omi&s;&s;ions too tedious to enu|merate, which are &s;wallowed implicitly by the ig|norant and illiterate, to the un&s;peakable detriment of the public. In another of his <HI>pharmaceutic works,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His Praelectiones pharmac. by Dr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> Lect. ix.</NOTE> he teaches the apothecary how <HI>to &s;ub&s;titute,</HI> and gives even a li&s;t of &s;uch things as he ju&s;tifies the &s;ub|&s;titution of for others. Among the&s;e he &s;ays, that <HI>bal&s;am capivi</HI> may be given for <HI>balm of gilead; &s;tyrax,</HI> for <HI>balm of tolu; &s;affron</HI> for <HI>bezoar; bole</HI> for <HI>dragon's
<PB N="49" REF="49">blood,</HI> for <HI>carthamus &s;eed mu&s;tard &s;eed,</HI> and other &s;uch like &s;hocking incoherencies. Yet all the&s;e, however dangerous and de&s;tructive to &s;ociety they may prove, are in &s;ome &s;ort excu&s;able in the&s;e who could have known no better; at lea&s;t they are more pardonable than the many wilful frauds and corruptions, which the <HI>apothecaries</HI> and <HI>druggi&s;ts,</HI> have been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed to, that like a liar who has told his fal&s;e tale &s;o often over, that he at length brings him&s;elf to believe it truth) they have &s;o far hardened their con&s;ciences, as to judge the mo&s;t vile and pernicious counterfeits, not only ju&s;tifiable, but as good as the true and genuine medicines; and &s;o have generou&s;ly reduced the prices of many compo&s;itions, by half le&s;s than any hone&s;t man can &s;ell them. By which means, &s;everal have become &s;uch ab&s;olute &s;trangers to the very faces of medicines, that they have been known to reject the genuine, when offered to &s;ale, and prefer the mo&s;t ba&s;e <HI>&s;ub&s;titutes</HI> or <HI>adulterations.</HI></P>
<P>The unparalleled, naked <HI>villainy</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h druggi&s;ts,</HI> which ours, as far as they can, imitate, is the principal cau&s;e of the many abominable <HI>&s;ophi&s;ti|cations</HI> of medicines. I am well informed, that the&s;e avaricious fal&s;ifiers, who are well ver&s;ed in robbing their KING and COUNTRY, were &s;o au|dacious and &s;o impudent, as to declare, in a Body before the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament;</HI> in an&s;wer to the pre|amble of a bill, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of KING GEORGE the fir&s;t, of GLORIOUS MEMORY, <Q>"That they did not vend any un&s;ound, or adulterate drugs or me|dicines, to the prejudice of his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> but that all &s;uch they &s;ent to IRELAND"</Q>&mdash;And they thought, no doubt, their u&s;ele&s;s &s;craps and offals, too good for us; becau&s;e we find by woeful experience, that the latter part of their wicked a&s;&s;ertion, they daily veri|fy. For tho' the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> privy council did this unhappy i&s;land the ju&s;tice, to retort this an&s;wer up|on the &s;ame worthy &s;et of men, when, by the in|&s;tigation
<PB N="50" REF="50">of their <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> corre&s;pondents, they oppo&s;ed the bill, pa&s;&s;ed here, in the year 1735, and &s;o, una|nimou&s;ly recommended it to the Royal A&s;&s;ent; yet no means has hitherto been found, to prevent this being the common &s;ink of all the corrupt, or decay|ed drugs of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The abu&s;e of the <HI>draw-back,</HI> given to encourage trade and exportation in <HI>England,</HI> proves now a ma|nife&s;t injury to the KING'S <HI>Revenues,</HI> and an in&s;upe|rable impediment to following our trade here hone&s;tly; which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be de&s;tructive of the health and lives of the people of this kingdom. For the dread of di&s;covery, and due puni&s;hment, upon expo&s;ing bad drugs to &s;ale in <HI>London,</HI> together, with the advantages ari&s;ing by the <HI>draw-back</HI> upon &s;ending them to <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho' they were quite rotten and u&s;ele&s;s, will always be a motive to infe&s;t us with the refu&s;e of all their &s;ortments, the very <HI>cul|lings</HI> of their drugs, nay, the mere <HI>&s;weepings</HI> of their drug-ware-hou&s;es. For when a <HI>Londoner</HI> imports a drug, and pays the duty, he removes it to a ware|hou&s;e, and &s;orts it, and what proves &s;o un&s;ound or decayed, that he cannot with impunity, or credit, &s;ell there, he tran&s;ports to <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;wearing it to be within the limited time, and con&s;igning it to a proper corre&s;pondent. It arrives here, the corre&s;|pondent receives it, pays the duty, which (if not taxed in our Book of Rates, wherein mo&s;t drugs are much lower rated than in <HI>England</HI>) it is valued upon oath, by the <HI>Londoner</HI>'s directions, perhaps, not as many pence as it was fir&s;t valued &s;hillings; the duty is accordingly paid, and a certificate thereof returned to the <HI>London</HI> tran&s;porter, who is thereby intitled to draw-back the duty paid at fir&s;t importation, for &s;o much as was entered in <HI>Ireland;</HI> except a &s;mall mat|ter not exceeding two and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> or there|abouts. So that <HI>Rubarb,</HI> who&s;e duty upon impor|tation in <HI>England,</HI> is &s;ix &s;hillings and ten pence the pound, <HI>draws back</HI> upon exportation about &s;ix &s;hillings
<PB N="51" REF="51">and four pence, and mo&s;t other drugs in like propor|tion. For this cau&s;e, the mo&s;t vile drugs, which can e&s;cape the <HI>examiners</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> are &s;ent hither; the &s;aving the <HI>draw-back,</HI> if they got no more for them here, (where, by the by, a cu&s;tomer is never wanting for &s;uch) being a &s;ufficient incouragement. This is &s;o notorious a practice, that our importers often openly confe&s;s it, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> merchants are &s;o expert at this trade, that they &s;end their cor|re&s;pondents invoyces, with the <HI>draw-back</HI> calculated and deducted from their accounts. I have known a|bout twenty pounds of damaged Rubarb &s;ent by a merchant in <HI>London,</HI> to an apothecary in <HI>Dublin,</HI> up|on commi&s;&s;ion, with directions to &s;ell it expeditiou&s;|ly, for whatever he could. And altho' there was not a &s;ingle ounce &s;ound or fit for u&s;e in the cargo, yet a certain great <HI>druggi&s;t</HI> bought it, at about a fourth of the then current price of good Rubarb, and dyed it to impo&s;e upon his cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>Familiar in&s;tances of the&s;e abu&s;es, almo&s;t every entry of drugs, and I believe of many other mer|chandizes affords. I &s;hall mention but a remarkable one made by a late celebrated druggi&s;t, about the year 1728. He imported eight hundred weight of Je&s;uits Bark, entered it at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, valued upon oath, at a groat per pound. The land-officer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Craven.</HI></NOTE> &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;trange undervaluation, not know|ing the quality of the drug; before he would make a &s;eizure, (which, if undervalued, he had a right to) advi&s;ed with that faithful, eminent chemi&s;t, the ingenious Mr. <HI>Maple,</HI> who, upon examining it, a&s;&s;u|red him, that it was not worth one penny a pound, having not a &s;ingle characteri&s;tic of the drugg it was entered for, by which it might be even known.&mdash; This in&s;tance &s;hews the cau&s;e, in confirmation of the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome learned phy&s;icians,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Harris Pharm. Anti-Empir. p. 190.</NOTE> why one
<PB N="52" REF="52">drachm or two of <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> &s;ucceeded better for|merly, than &s;ome ounces now a days.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>is the</HI> KING <HI>mo&s;t ungenerou&s;ly robbed of his ju&s;t revenues,</HI> and thus <HI>are the health and lives of his &s;ub|jects endangered,</HI> or <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> by the iniquitous con|federacy of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h Druggi&s;ts,</HI> particu|larly in their gro&s;s abu&s;e of that great encourage|ment to trade, <HI>a draw-back.</HI> And as &s;uch vile per|nicious &s;tuff as this is daily imported and &s;old by mercenary men among us, who have nothing to re|commend them but their under&s;elling every fair dealer, it is plain a <HI>faithful apothecary,</HI> who chu&s;es the be&s;t commodities at any rate, for the good of his cu&s;tomers, and his own <HI>private &s;atisfastion,</HI> mu&s;t appear a mo&s;t extravagant extortioner to all &s;uch as cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the qualities of Medicines, and con&s;equently, <HI>he cannot expect a livelihood by his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, if he per&s;i&s;ts in candor and integrity!</HI></P>

<PB N="53" REF="53">the very <HI>fal&s;ifiers</HI> grown in this wicked practice, that the <HI>pretended Druggi&s;ts</HI> in effect confe&s;s it; For I have it under the hand of one of them in a Bill of Rates, <HI>that he &s;ells the &s;trained for little more than one third of the price of the crude Galbanum.</HI></P>
<P>So ba&s;e is the counterfeit &s;old for <HI>Bal&s;am Capivi,</HI> which is a natural <HI>tear</HI> or <HI>juice</HI> i&s;&s;uing upon inci&s;ion of a certain tree in <HI>America,</HI> that it is openly &s;old with us for le&s;s than the <HI>King's</HI> duty upon importation of that drug.</P>
<P>When &s;uch barefaced villainy is committed in the &s;imple drugs, what may we not expect in the com|pound Medicines? Since the more compound or mixed a remedy is, the better opportunity there mu&s;t be for cheating, by &s;ub&s;tituting the ba&s;e&s;t for the be&s;t, or leaving out the deare&s;t and principal in|gredient in the compo&s;ition, in order to deceive the cu&s;tomers, and under&s;ell the hone&s;t compounder.</P>
<P>To point out all the abu&s;es in this way, mu&s;t <HI>(alas!)</HI> be no le&s;s than a comment upon the di&s;pen|&s;atory, which would be too tedious and prolix, and by rea&s;on of the difficulty of comprehending the nature or effects of <HI>frauds</HI> in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> without &s;ome knowledge in <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> as well as a good under|&s;tanding in that art, I have cho&s;e to mention but ome of the mo&s;t obvious.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jallap</HI> Root is &s;old for &s;ix or &s;even &s;hillings the pound, yet is the <HI>Re&s;in,</HI> extracted at great ex|pence and labour, tho' &s;ixteen ounces of one, will not afford two ounces of the other, &s;o vilely &s;ophi&s;ti|cated, as to be &s;old by our Druggi&s;ts for two &s;hillings an ounce.</P>
<P>The more compound and expen&s;ive a Medicine is, the more art and indu&s;try is u&s;ed to <HI>&s;ophi&s;ticate</HI> or <HI>deba&s;e</HI> it. Thus the <HI>Treacle of Andromachus,</HI> which takes it's name from the phy&s;ician of <HI>Nero</HI> the <HI>tyrant,</HI> who invented it, and the <HI>Mithridate,</HI> which takes it's name al&s;o from it's royal author <HI>Mithridates</HI> king of <HI>Pontus,</HI> both which have been received into all the
<PB N="54" REF="54">Di&s;pen&s;atories, and ever &s;ince deemed the <HI>Capital Medicines</HI> in all the &s;hops in <HI>Europe;</HI> and of which the wi&s;e States of <HI>Venice</HI> have taken &s;uch &s;pecial care in the compo&s;ition, that they are not to be di&s;|pen&s;ed in the republic but under the in&s;pection of Magi&s;trates appointed for that purpo&s;e, whence the former got the common appellation of <HI>Venice-Treacle,</HI> becau&s;e for a long time none was reckoned good that was not made there; altho' it is mo&s;t certain, that it may, and has been, as ju&s;tly and faithfully di&s;|pen&s;ed and prepared here as there, or in any other place what&s;oever: The&s;e noble Medicines, which for &s;uch a tract of time have &s;tood the te&s;t, and were ever held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, are now fallen into &s;uch di&s;repute and contempt, through the fre|quent <HI>deba&s;ings</HI> and <HI>adulterations</HI> they have under|gone, that it is rare to find either ever pre&s;cribed for internal u&s;e by phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>The temptations to <HI>di&s;hone&s;ty</HI> are certainly greater in our trade than in any other what&s;oever, from the prodigious gains and a&s;&s;ured &s;ecrecy that attend our wor&s;t <HI>Deceits.</HI> Mo&s;t are capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing frauds in the ordinary nece&s;&s;aries of life; but as &s;ome <HI>branch</HI> of <HI>medicine</HI> alone can apprehend tho&s;e in <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> &s;o the apothecaries <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s</HI> undi&s;|covered, or even un&s;u&s;pected, openly, ea&s;ily, and &s;ecurely. Few Medicines have &s;uffered more by the hands of di&s;hone&s;t operators, than tho&s;e (once) ju&s;tly famed compo&s;itions, ju&s;t now mentioned; the one of which con&s;i&s;ts of above &s;eventy, the other of about fifty ingredients, mo&s;tly very rare, the pro|ducts of the mo&s;t remote parts of the World, and con&s;equently difficult to be had &s;ound and genuine; yet are both &s;o wretchedly deba&s;ed by mercenary artificers, that they are daily openly &s;old for le&s;s than half the fir&s;t co&s;t of the true compo&s;ition: Nay, the very in&s;cription and &s;eal, clapt upon the <HI>Treacle</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> by the in&s;pecting magi&s;trates, is now artfully counterfeited in <HI>London,</HI> and put upon
<PB N="55" REF="55">pots or cani&s;ters of their own vile manufacture to deceive the ignorant and unwary; and this kind you may &s;ometimes &s;ee hawked here as well as in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by a pretended <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;ailor, who perhaps never cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas.</P>
<P>It is well known to every phy&s;ician and good apothecary, that <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Hart's-horn</HI> (properly &s;peak|ing) con&s;i&s;ts of nothing more than the volatile Salt, di&s;&s;olved in the radical Humidity, and blended with a &s;mall portion of the native exalted oil of that Animal, extracted from his horns by fire, according to art; and it's celebrated u&s;es and virtues are too well known to require any panegyric. Yet this mo&s;t ad|mirable Medicine is now &s;o ba&s;ely <HI>counterfeited,</HI> that the few who have it genuine cannot pretend to &s;ell it without lo&s;s; being under&s;old by all the avaricious fal&s;ifiers of medicines, who make what they un|ju&s;tly give that name to, and impo&s;e upon the pub|lic in it's room, of no better materials than <HI>&s;tale pi&s;s, brine, &s;oot,</HI> and <HI>roche-lime.</HI> And neverthele&s;s this <HI>adulteration</HI> has &s;o far gained ground and prevailed, that nothing but the pungent, quick-&s;melling <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>pi&s;s</HI> will go down with the generality, being &s;o long accu&s;tomed to this vile, <HI>excrementitious di&s;till|ment,</HI> which &s;trikes the &s;en&s;es &s;o much more quick and piquant, that they pronounce the other dead or vapid.</P>
<P>Spirit of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> is directed to be made with Salt of Tartar; but becau&s;e lime is cheaper, and affords more &s;pirit, it is mo&s;tly u&s;ed for it, tho' the &s;pirits rai&s;ed by both are extremely different.</P>
<P>How unequal the effects of true <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>hart's-horn</HI> and that of <HI>pi&s;s,</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> with <HI>&s;alt</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> and that with <HI>lime,</HI> may be upon the human body, I mu&s;t leave to the learned in, phy&s;ic to determine; but this I can &s;ay from actual ob&s;er|vation, that true <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>Hart's-horn</HI> and that of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> with <HI>&s;alt</HI> of <HI>Tartar,</HI> are, in their own natures, truly alkaline, and produce a con&s;iderable

<P>I could lay mine hand upon a certain venerable, antique Gentleman, who occa&s;ionally per&s;onates a Phy&s;ician or Chirurgeon, an Apothecary, Chemi&s;t or Druggi&s;t, and GARTH <HI>'s Colon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;pen&s;ary, <HI>Cant.</HI> ii.</NOTE>,</P>

<P>Who takes a &s;horter and ea&s;ier method of counter|feiting the&s;e <HI>&s;pirits,</HI> tho' equally foreign to the true, and, perhaps, equally pernicious with the former <HI>&s;ophi&s;tications.</HI> He takes <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> one part, <HI>Pot-a&s;hes</HI> two parts, and common water a &s;ufficient quantity to di&s;&s;olve the whole: when di&s;&s;olved, he &s;trains, and puts one part in a gla&s;s, fal&s;ely labelled, for <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> of <HI>Sal Ammoniac,</HI> and the other, tinged yellow, in one, more unju&s;tly titled, for <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>Hart's-horn;</HI> and &s;ells both at a mo&s;t exorbitant price, under the re&s;pective fal&s;e denominations afore|&s;aid, by the iniquitous u&s;e of the name of a certain con&s;iderable Chemi&s;t before-mentioned, on whom he fathers many other &s;purious compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on, without any great knowledge in <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> or <HI>Chemy,</HI> may &s;hew what a contrary effect the&s;e <HI>cheats</HI> mu&s;t produce, from the genuine medi|cines; and it is not difficult to conceive how both Patient and Pre&s;criber mu&s;t &s;uffer by the u&s;e of this <HI>horrid impo&s;ture:</HI> For it is evidently but a mere &s;o|lution of the&s;e crude &s;alts, and con&s;equently loaden with the cau&s;tic <HI>Pot-a&s;hes,</HI> as well as the <HI>marine &s;alt</HI> in the <HI>Sal Ammoniac;</HI> both which compo&s;e a <HI>third kind,</HI> very repugnant to the properties of either <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> or <HI>Hart's-horn,</HI> and which is &s;o fixed as not to be rai&s;ed by any degree of fire; whereas
<PB N="57" REF="57">what is truly <HI>volatile</HI> alone, (which only can an&s;wer the intentions of tho&s;e who pre&s;cribe either <HI>&s;pirits</HI>) is elevated by the gentle&s;t heat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tincture</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> another admirable remedy, is likewi&s;e ba&s;ely <HI>&s;ophi&s;ticated.</HI> It is ordered by the learned Authors of the Di&s;pen&s;atory we are to follow, to be extracted with &s;pirit of <HI>French</HI> wine rectified, fir&s;t di&s;tilled from <HI>Ca&s;tor, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Lavender Flowers,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>aromatic, nervous</HI> medicines, and this is called <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tor;</HI> which mu&s;t undoubtedly render the <HI>tincture</HI> more powerful and effectual for the purpo&s;es de&s;igned. Yet, not|with&s;tanding, quite regardle&s;s of it's virtues or effects, you will find the apothecaries great &s;trangers to this medicine. I have heard one of the mo&s;t eminent among them, a man of great reputed hone&s;ty and under&s;tanding &s;ay, in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome con&s;ider|able Members of the College of Phy&s;icians, that this &s;pirit is good for nothing, and that brandy ex|tracted as good a <HI>tincture</HI> from the <HI>Ca&s;tor.</HI> It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>brandy,</HI> or the <HI>common, foe|tid, foul, Malt</HI> or <HI>Molo&s;&s;us &s;pirits,</HI> which are mo&s;t frequently u&s;ed upon this and the like occa&s;ions, in|&s;tead of &s;pirit of wine, will acquire as deep a color from Ca&s;tor and &s;uch like &s;ub&s;tances, as the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> or any other &s;pirit, of equal &s;trength with them, can do; and that may perhaps &s;uffice &s;uch as only aim at the ba&s;e&s;t rate to <HI>counterfeit</HI> the external form or appearance of a medicine, to an&s;wer their own mercenary ends alone. And we know <HI>deceptions</HI> are attempted in this kind, where the very &s;imilitude is wanting: For this &s;ame <HI>fal&s;e, reddi&s;h tincture</HI> has been &s;old for the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> which is pure and limpid.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k any candid man, conver&s;ant in Phar|macy, a few Que&s;tions, which he cannot, without concern, an&s;wer.

<P>Thus have I endeavoured to lay before you a &s;hort &s;ketch of the mo&s;t common, <HI>wilful abu&s;es</HI> of Apothecaries and Druggi&s;ts, which alone may &s;hew, how the Di&s;hone&s;t injure the KING <HI>'s Revenues,</HI> impo&s;e upon the <HI>Public</HI> in general, and prejudice every branch of the <HI>Healing Art,</HI> the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> in particular, the hone&s;t of whom are grievou&s;ly op|pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>fraudulent.</HI> See p. 52.</P>

<P>When a phy&s;ician writes for an <HI>ounce</HI> of any me|dicine, he expects <HI>eight drachms</HI> of <HI>&s;ixty grains</HI> each, according to the table of weights prefixed to the di&s;pen&s;atory; but he unexpectedly falls &s;hort of a|bout <HI>fifty four</HI> grains. For in&s;tead of the <HI>medical</HI> the <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>avoir-du-poize</HI> weights are u&s;ed, each ounce of which contains but about <HI>&s;even drachms</HI> and <HI>&s;ix grains</HI> of the former weight. The evils ari&s;ing from this practice are not in many ca&s;es le&s;s detri|mental to the public, than the frauds and abu&s;es already mentioned in medicines.</P>
<P>All the officinal compo&s;itions, and extemporane|ous pre&s;criptions, are &s;o calculated by the pre&s;cribers, that if duly prepared according to their intentions, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily know to the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, the quantity of the <HI>principal,</HI> and indeed of every <HI>re&s;pective</HI> ingredient contained in a do&s;e, or any given quantity of the mixt medicine. Thus for in&s;tance, <HI>four &s;cruples</HI> of <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> are known to contain <HI>one grain</HI> of <HI>opium, half a drachm</HI> of <HI>the Earl of Warwick's powder, eighteen grains</HI> of <HI>&s;cam|mony,</HI> and &s;o forth. Without knowing this to the greate&s;t certainty, no man can &s;afely pre&s;cribe; for by this rule it is, that all mixt or compound medicines are do&s;ed and pre&s;cribed. But as the weights are now confounded, it is not po&s;&s;ible for a phy&s;ician to adju&s;t the do&s;e of any compo&s;ition with the lea&s;t certainty.

<PB N="65" REF="65">in the do&s;ing.

So that in&s;tead of <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twenty grains</HI> in <HI>one ounce,</HI> or <HI>eight drachms,</HI> here is the like number of grains in <HI>&s;even drachms</HI> and <HI>&s;ix grains</HI> of this electuary: And as the &s;ame di&s;pro|portion holds in all other compo&s;itions, the <HI>grains not varying in any weights,</HI> &s;o the phy&s;ician in this re&s;pect too, is expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t dangerous <HI>decep|tion;</HI> for his patients mu&s;t be frequently <HI>over do&s;ed</HI> in the chief, active ingredients in his pre&s;criptions, and in the more &s;imple, <HI>under do&s;ed,</HI> as every ounce given wants almo&s;t one eighth. This dire confu&s;ion increa&s;es with the weights; for the <HI>medical pound</HI> is above <HI>two ounces</HI> l ghter than the <HI>avoir-du-pois</HI> What a doubtful, incon&s;i&s;tent medley mu&s;t &s;uch compo&s;itions be, as are di&s;pen&s;ed thus unju&s;tly and irregularly?</P>

<P>But the grand in&s;inuation in my prejudice, which has heretofore been made and will now probably be revived, is, <HI>that regardle&s;s of all public good, in unrea&s;onable aver&s;ion and appo&s;ition to my fraternity, and by way of adverti&s;ing and extolling my &s;elf, by depretia|ting them, I have turned a reformer, being in every in&s;tance acted more by &s;elfi&s;h mercenary views, than any other.</HI>&mdash;This, I hope, to every con&s;iderate unpreju|diced reader, will appear as malicious, and as ground|le&s;s, as the re&s;t of their ba&s;e detraction is fal&s;e and uncharitable. I challenge any man to &s;ay, I was e|ver once known to le&s;&s;en the ju&s;t merits of any apo|thecary or druggi&s;t what&s;oever. Had I none other motive than common policy, I &s;hould not attempt to recommend my &s;elf to the world by &s;uch low, mean artifice: moreover, let it but be con&s;idered, did I heretofore, or do I now offer ought to the detri|ment of any hone&s;t, ju&s;t apothecary, chemi&s;t or druggi&s;t? If I have, I declare it the effects of mere inadvertency; for it is not to be rea&s;onably imagined, that I &s;hould knowingly do any thing to the prejudice of a profe&s;&s;ion, which I have made my choice, by which I have hitherto lived, and &s;till purpo&s;e to follow, as long as the &s;ame excellent &s;et of cu&s;tomers, which have hitherto dealt with me,
<PB N="78" REF="78">and mo&s;t nobly and generou&s;ly encouraged me, are plea&s;ed to continue their unmerited favors. In the next place, I &s;ubmit it to the judgement of every candid brea&s;t, what <HI>mercenary views</HI> I could have had in this undertaking. I believe it is evident, tho' I was at great expence, and much trouble in writing and printing, and in attending the parlia|ment in the year 1735, that, in&s;tead of gaining any &s;elfi&s;h advantages thereby, or in any &s;ort &s;olliciting for &s;uch, I have been a con&s;iderable &s;ufferer, if it were by none other means, than bringing upon me (tho' I hope unde&s;ervedly) the implacable hatred and en|mity of all the apothecaries and druggi&s;ts. And I hope there are &s;ome men of quality and di&s;tinction, &s;till living, who can atte&s;t, that tho' I was incou|raged to &s;ue for a parliamentary reward, yet I ju&s;t|ly di&s;dained all applications for the like, being con|tent with the public good, which was likely to ac|crue from my weak endeavours. <HI>Vertue to a prepared heart, never fails of bringing an ample, concomitant re|ward.</HI></P>
<P>This I will however confefs; that I have &s;ome <HI>&s;elfi&s;h private</HI> (tho' not altogether mercenary) <HI>views,</HI> in &s;olliciting a reformation of pharmacy, and a &s;trict examination of apothecaries and their &s;hops, becau&s;e I would from my <HI>&s;elf,</HI> as well as <HI>others,</HI> remove all temptations to the abu&s;e or corruption of my profe&s;|&s;ion, and by all ways and means, promote the know|ledge thereof, and give all rea&s;onable encouragement to following it &s;trictly, ju&s;tly, and faithfully. And I conceive the examination of apothecaries and drug|gi&s;ts, and the in&s;pection of their &s;hops, would be one motive; as it mu&s;t prove as advantageous to e|very &s;kilful hone&s;t apothecary and druggi&s;t, as it mu&s;t be di&s;advantageous to the unskilful and di&s;|hone&s;t. Moreover, as the apothecaries and drug|gi&s;ts, have been very active, and I have &s;ome rea|&s;ons to judge, there are &s;ome of them &s;till unwearied in wounding my character and reputation, in the mo&s;t fal&s;e, malicious, and uncharitable manner; I
<PB N="79" REF="79">hope it is not culpable in me to &s;eek, with the re|dre&s;s of a general grievance, a public method of confuting tho&s;e groundle&s;s calumnies.

<P>From one of your great humanity, refined ta&s;te, and ju&s;t notions of morality, I fear I may dread &s;ome cen&s;ure for an unbecoming zeal, in u&s;ing thro' this di&s;cour&s;e &s;ome <HI>terms of reproach, expre&s;&s;ions, which may be&s;peak an un&s;eemly freedom with my frater|nity,</HI> or &s;uch as <HI>as may &s;avour &s;omewhat of &s;pleen or in|vective.</HI> In this re&s;pect, perhaps, I am to blame, but when you con&s;ider how difficult it is to treat &s;uch vile offenders as I complain of more properly, or for a man of any con&s;cience, or under&s;tanding, barely to mention &s;uch ba&s;e degeneracy, &s;uch abominable perfidious villainy, as I have laid before you, or even but to think of the like, without &s;ome heat, indig|nation, and abhorrence, I hope it will, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, plead my excu&s;e.
