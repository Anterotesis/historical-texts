<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS CONCERNING The Unu&s;ual Qualities OF THE AIR, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SINCE all Creatures who have the Faculty of Re&s;piration, and live upon the Superficies of this Terre&s;trial Globe, and inha|bit the &s;everal Climates of the known
<PB N="2" REF="7">World, are obliged to breathe the Common Air or Atmo&s;phere they live in; and &s;ince not only tho&s;e, but Mankind, who&s;e Lives are more particularly valuable, as a Creature of the mo&s;t Noble and fir&s;t Rank, are &s;ubject to be altered and vari|ou&s;ly affected, according to the dif|ferent Qualities of that Air; and to receive different Impre&s;&s;ions, ac|cordingly as that is impregnated, and endowed with &s;everal various Extraneous Bodies, Vapours or Ef|flu&s;ions; and &s;ince the&s;e are not only likely to affect human Bodies ex|ternally through the Pores of the Skin, but internally, when &s;ucked into the Lungs, into more tender and rarify'd Ve&s;&s;els, containing hu|mours more exqui&s;itely rarify'd and expanded; and con&s;equently are liable to be altered and depraved ac|cording to the various Di&s;po&s;itions of that Air we breathe, which may lay the foundations of Di&s;orders and Di&s;tempers, pernicious and de&s;tructive
<PB N="3" REF="8">to human Bodies, as tho&s;e extraneous Bodies, Vapours, or Effluviums are more or le&s;s unwhol&s;ome and of a different Nature; I &s;ay, &s;ince Hu|man Bodies are thus di&s;po&s;ed and liable to be ill affected and di&s;ordered by the various Qualities of the Air we breathe, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary but requi&s;ite we &s;hould con&s;ider, the different Qualities of that Air, and what Extraneous Bodies, Vapours, or Effluviums it may be impregnated and endowed with; and what alte|rations or ill Effects the&s;e may occa|&s;ion and produce, either at the pre|&s;ent, or for the future; and how far they may be prejudicial and perni|tious to Mankind.</P>
<P>To determine and enable us to judge of the different Qualities of the Air, and what Extraneous Bodies or Va|pours it may be Impregnated and Endowed with, we are to con&s;ider, how many Ways it may be furni&s;hed with &s;uch Vapours or Effluviums;
<PB N="4" REF="9">which mu&s;t be, either from foreign Globes, far di&s;tant from the Earth we live in, and from the Superficies of our Atmo&s;phere; from extrane|ous Bodies, or Vapours emitted or ri&s;ing from Bodies on the Superficies of our Globe; or from Vapours and Effluviums tran&s;uding and a&s;|cending out of the Bowels of the Earth.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e Globes which are va&s;t|ly di&s;tant from the Earth we live in, and far remote from the Superficies of our Atmo&s;phere, the&s;e are either the Stars, the Moon or the Sun.</P>
<P>The Stars are &s;o many Thou&s;and Miles di&s;tant from us, and &s;eparated by &s;uch a &s;pacious and boundle&s;s Aether or Medium, that we can but ju&s;t perceive the Glimmering rays of tho&s;e Cele&s;tial Bodies, which are &s;ufficient to convince us that there are &s;uch Stupendious Effects of an Infinite Power; but they are &s;o &s;mall,
<PB N="5" REF="10">that they can have but little Effects in altering the Qualities of the Air we Breathe; much le&s;s are they able to inform us, of the Nature of tho&s;e di&s;tarit Globes; and con&s;e|quently cannot afford us any know|ledge what Alterations &s;uch can pro|duce; only we may conclude, that where the Cau&s;es are &s;mall and &s;carce perceivable, the Effects mu&s;t be in|con&s;iderable; and therefore can do little good, except as Luminaries, or produce not much ill; and con|&s;equently cannot contribute much to pervert it or deprave the Di&s;po|&s;ition of our Air or Atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>As for the Moon, though that is much nearer than any of the Stars, yet it is al&s;o placed at a great di|&s;tance from the Superficies of the Earth, and &s;eparated by a va&s;t ex|tent of fine Aether, which interpo&s;es betwixt that Globe and ours, and prevents it from any im|mediate Effects upon the Air we live
<PB N="6" REF="11">in; and though &s;everal Effects are attributed to it, becau&s;e the Periods &s;eem to keep time with its different Po&s;itions, yet it is contrary to all known Laws Statical or Hydro&s;tatical, that it &s;hould have any Effect upon any Bodies contained within our At|mo&s;phere, as having no immediate contact with terrene Bodies, but only upon that Aether, which equally encompa&s;&s;es and compre&s;&s;es the Su|perficies of our Vortex, and the ut|mo&s;t Extent of the Globe we live and breathe upon or in; for the Air or Atmo&s;phere may be properly &s;aid to be a part of our Globe though the mo&s;t fluid and rarify'd Superficial covering of Earth and Water, and though Lunaticks, or tho&s;e Di&s;tem|pers which grow wor&s;e at certain periods, &s;eem to be equal in di&s;tance with the &s;everal Po&s;itions of the Moon, yet it cannot be demon|&s;trated, that tho&s;e Effects are owing to it as a Cau&s;e, &s;ince other periodi|cal Di&s;tempers keep an equal di&s;tance
<PB N="7" REF="12">betwixt their Periods, which depend upon Cau&s;es contained within the Limits of our own Bodies; and as for the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, that mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome o|ther Cau&s;e, both Statical and Hy|dro&s;tatical Rules excluding it any &s;hare in the&s;e different Motions of that fluid Element; but not to en|ter upon Di&s;putes of that Nature, which are foreign to our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the Beams of the Moon, which illu|minate our Globe; are only reflected Beams of the Sun tran&s;mitted into our Atmo&s;phere, and not the proper Emanations or Effluviums of that Globe; and for as much as the Beams of the Sun reflected from other Sub|&s;tances within our Globe, do not tran&s;mit to us the Nature of tho&s;e Bodies they are reflected from, but are only variou&s;ly modifyd and re|fracted in the Superficies of tho&s;e Bodies, which different refractions variou&s;ly affect our Sen&s;ory, or the
<PB N="8" REF="13">Organ of Sights, and produce the Sen&s;ation of different Colours or Refractions, and which only affect the Sen&s;e of Seeing, as they are &s;tronger or weaker: Con&s;equently we cannot expect, that the Beams of the Sun, reflected from the Super|ficies of the Moon, &s;hould convey to us the Qualities of that Body or Globe, e&s;pecially &s;ince they are like|wi&s;e convey'd through &s;o fine a Strai|ner as the interpo&s;ed Aether, and re|fracted and altered al&s;o in pa&s;&s;ing through the great and lofty expanded part of our Atmo&s;phere, which is reckoned, or computed, to be Seven Miles perpendicular in height, boying up a Pillar of Quick&s;ilver in a Wea|ther-Gla&s;s, &s;uch a con&s;iderable height, till it amounts to an Aequilibrium, or equal Weight of a Pillar of Air, of the &s;ame Diameter and thickne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ing upon the Ba&s;is, or Bottom of that Pipe the Mercury or Quick|&s;ilver is contained in.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="14">
<P>As for the Sun, it is evident, that it acts upon all Bodies within our Atmo&s;phere by Virtue of its Heat, &s;ince in the Summer time, when it is near enough, it rarifies, expands and dige&s;ts the Superficial Juices of the Earth, as well tho&s;e in our Bodies, which when fermented, attenuated and rarify'd, are pre&s;&s;ed by the force of the incumbent Atmo&s;phere in|to the Roots of Plants and Trees, and ri&s;e higher, as further rarify'd, pre&s;s'd and expanded in the Ve&s;&s;els of each Plant, which being variou&s;ly fermented and &s;trained through dif|ferent Ve&s;&s;els along with Specifick Juices, are a&s;&s;imilated and converted into the proper Juices of tho&s;e Plants.</P>
<P>The Sun Beams al&s;o affect other Bodies on the Superficies of the Earth, and by their active Parts, put the Parts of other Sub&s;tances in Mo|tion, and cau&s;es them to emit Va|pours and Effluviums, which, ac|cording to their different Natures
<PB N="10" REF="15">variou&s;ly alter and affect the Air we breathe, and render it more or le&s;s whole&s;ome and pernicious, Healthful or De&s;tructive: But though the Sun hath &s;uch con&s;iderable Effects upon this Globe, when near us, yet when but a little further off in the Winter, we &s;ee that it hath little or no apparent Effects upon the Climate we live in; and if &s;o &s;mall a dif|ference can extingui&s;h the obvious Effects of &s;o bright a Body as the Sun, we can &s;carce imagin, that the Moon or Stars which are much fur|ther off and Shine but faintly, &s;hould have any con&s;iderable Effects, or indeed any at all, e&s;pecially &s;ince they cannot be perceived.</P>
<P>It appearing hence, in a great Mea|&s;ure, how the Air we breathe may be altered by Foreign Globes far di&s;tant from our Earth, we are next to con&s;ider how the Air we breathe in may be altered and depraved by Vapours and Effluviums emitted,
<PB N="11" REF="16">and ari&s;ing from the Superficies of the Globe we inhabit, which appears from the va&s;t variety of different Sub&s;tances which may be ob&s;erved on the Superficies of the Globe we live upon, which deprave the Natural Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air, and con&s;equently variou&s;ly affect the Ma&s;s of Humours circulating through the minute and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els con|tained in and di&s;per&s;ed through the Sub&s;tance of the Lungs, &s;uch as pu|trify'd Bodies, and the con&s;tant E|manation of Vapours occa&s;ioned by &s;tanding Waters, and the unwhole|&s;ome Stenches which naturally flow from the products of Art, as well as Nature, which more particularly affect tho&s;e Per&s;ons employed in &s;uch Arts, and more immediately exerci&s;ed about them; thus we &s;ee the &s;trange decay in tho&s;e Per&s;ons which work in Pot-hou&s;es, Chymi|cal Elaboratories, and other employ|ments, where they are expo&s;ed to unwhole&s;ome Vapours and preternar|tural
<PB N="12" REF="17">Fumes. And the&s;e are further improved to an ill purpo&s;e, and grow more pernicious and unwhole|&s;ome, and deprave the whole&s;ome Di&s;po&s;iton of the Air, when more forceably put in Action by the united force and heat of the Sun Beams.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Alteration which the Air receives from the Extraneous mix|ture of Vapours and Effluviums, &s;eems to be from &s;uch as tran&s;ude and a&s;cend out of the Bowels of the Earth, whether of a Mineral kind or of any other Nature. And as &s;uch &s;ort of Vapours and Effluviums are mo&s;t likely to produce great and ex|traordinary Alterations, &s;o cones|quently tho&s;e Alterations are pro|bably mo&s;t pernicious, and of the wor&s;t con&s;equence, and apte&s;t to oc|casion the wor&s;t of Accidents in hu|man Bodies.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="18">
<P>From &s;uch kind of Vapours dif|fervently agitated and put in Action by the nearer approach, or greater di&s;tance of the Sun, &s;eems to ari&s;e that great variety of Climates, not only in the &s;ame Latitude, but &s;e|veral Parts of the Terre&s;trial Globe; for accordingly as the Air is variou&s;ly affected with &s;uch Effluviums of dif|ferent kinds, the&s;e Vapours being put in Action by the heat of the Sun Beams produce different Effects, and render the Air in &s;uch Climates more or le&s;s whole&s;ome, pernicious and depraved: Thus Agues are more frequent in <HI>Kent,</HI> and other Di|&s;tempers more common and custom|mary in different Parts of the World.</P>
<P>When by the Con&s;tant and Cu&s;to|mary tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of particular Va|pours and Effluviums, any Country is frequently or con&s;tantly &s;ubject to &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es; the&s;e Di&s;tempers are &s;aid to be Endemical or proper to that particular Climate; but when
<PB N="14" REF="19">Contagious or Malignant Di&s;tempers happen to rage more than commonly or accidentally in any Place, &s;uch Di&s;orders are called Epidemical, or &s;preading at &s;ome particular Times, ari&s;ing from the accidental Di&s;charge and A&s;cen&s;ion of particular Vapours out of the Bowels of the Earth at that Time.</P>
<P>The Temper of the Air in dif|ferent Climates is al&s;o altered dif|ferently according to the Quantity as well as Quality of &s;uch Vapours, and as the Air is more plentifully or &s;paringly impregnated with &s;uch pre|ternatural Vapours, which al&s;o in the &s;ame Climates exert them&s;elves more or le&s;s vigorou&s;ly according to the different Sea&s;ons of the Year. Thus in Summer time Contagious or Ma|lignant Di&s;tempers rage more vigo|rou&s;ly and univer&s;ally and are le&s;s Epi|demical in the Winter.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="20">
<P>And as the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air varies according to dif|ferent Climates, the various quan|tities of Mineral Effluviums, and the different Sea&s;ons of the Year; &s;o we find a va&s;t difference according to the Nature and Qualities of &s;uch Mineral Vapours. Some Minerals afford very whole&s;ome and Salutiferous Steams, whil&s;t others are dangerous and per|nicious. Thus the Mines in <HI>Cornwall</HI> make the Country whole&s;ome and healthful, whil&s;t others produce Con|tagious and Pe&s;tilential Qualities, which render &s;uch Countries frequent|ly &s;ubject to &s;uch Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Mineral Effluviums or Va|pours which produce Pe&s;tilential Di&s;|ea&s;es, are of a mo&s;t pernicious kind, and are attended with very violent and mo&s;t fatal Symptoms, and &s;uch are e&s;teemed, by that mo&s;t Worthy and profound Judge of the Works of Nature, the Honourable <HI>Robert Boyle,</HI> to be of an Ar&s;enical
<PB N="16" REF="21">kind, producing Effects of the mo&s;t Malignant and Poi&s;onous Nature, being mo&s;t offen&s;ive and de&s;tructive to Human Bodies.</P>
<P>It appearing then from what we have &s;aid, that the Temper of the Air, and its mo&s;t Unu&s;ual Qualities, which are likewi&s;e mo&s;t de&s;tructive and dangerous, chiefly depend on the Effluviums or Vapours ri&s;ing out of the Bowels of the Earth, when|ever we find the Temper and Di&s;po|&s;ition of any Climate to vary and differ from what it commonly does in &s;uch Climates, we have good rea|&s;on to conclude, that the Air is Im|pregnated with &s;ome unu&s;ual Efflu|viums out of the Bowels of this Ter|re&s;trial Globe, which being mixed with and di&s;per&s;ed through the Air produce that uncommon Indi&s;po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we are con&s;tantly obli|ged to breathe the Air we live in, and
<PB N="17" REF="22">to impregnate our Blood with &s;uch Heterogeneous and offen&s;ive Particles, which perverting the Cour&s;e of Na|ture may produce ill Effects in human Bodies, we ought to be very careful to guard our &s;elves again&s;t &s;uch Ac|cidents as may be De&s;tructive, and &s;o prejudicial to Mankind, and to make u&s;e of nece&s;&s;ary precautions to prevent &s;uch ill Accidents, as &s;uch Inconveniencies may render us liable to.</P>
<P>It cannot be out of our Memory what fatal Con&s;equences have lately happened Abroad, e&s;pecially in the South Parts of <HI>France;</HI> and how many Thou&s;ands have been de&s;troy|ed by the fatal Effects of an ill di&s;|po&s;ed Temper of the Air, &s;o Mor|tal and Epidemical. And as other Parts of the World may be likely to &s;uffer by Accidents, and may be liable to the &s;ame approaching Dan|gers, by hidden Vapours and Efflu|viums tran&s;mitted from the inward
<PB N="18" REF="23">Parts of the Earth, and by Mineral Effluviums of a Malignant kind; whenever we find any unu&s;ual Quality in the Air, we have a great deal of Rea&s;on to be afraid of &s;ome unu&s;ual Accidents, and to make u&s;e of all nece&s;&s;ary precautions to prevent them. If &s;uch ill and Malignant Qualities &s;hould be convey'd from the inward Parts of the Earth into our Atmo&s;phere, &s;uch cautionary Preparations would arm us the bet|ter again&s;t their ill Effects; and tho' no &s;uch danger, as we might ju&s;tly fear, &s;hould happen, yet at lea&s;t we &s;hould reap this advantage by our jealous &s;urmi&s;es, that we &s;hould free our Bodies of ill di&s;po&s;ed Humours, and put our &s;elves in a better State and Condition of Health; &s;o that our Labour would not be ill be&s;tow|ed and fruitle&s;s, nor our Pains ill re|warded; the ju&s;t Cautions to arm our &s;elves again&s;t the greate&s;t of Dangers, would at lea&s;t &s;ecure us again&s;t le&s;s Evils.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="24">
<P>And that at the pre&s;ent, we have very probable Grounds and &s;ub&s;tan|tial Rea&s;ons to fear &s;ome impending Evil, and future Danger, which may too &s;uddenly happen in our Climate, and con&s;equently we ought to make u&s;e of proper Methods to prevent &s;uch Events, will in a great mea&s;ure appear, if we con&s;ider the Steps arid Progre&s;s of Malignant or Pe&s;tilen|tial Di&s;tempers in former Times, and al&s;o the Intemperies of our Climate for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and at the pre&s;ent time; which may give us &s;ufficient grounds to &s;u&s;pect the con&s;equential Intemperature of the Air for the fu|ture, or time to come.</P>
<P>As for the Steps and Progre&s;s of Malignant or Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers, formerly it hath been ob&s;erved, that the Pe&s;tilence took its Cour&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively through &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> beginning fir&s;t in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and then runing through <HI>Italy, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, England,</HI> &amp;c. In
<PB N="20" REF="25"><HI>Turkey</HI> it is Endemical, and con|&s;tantly appears every Year; but this in a great mea&s;ure depends on the exce&s;&s;ive Heats of the Climate, and their way of living; their Blood be|ing too much phlegmated to &s;upport and &s;upply a &s;ufficient Diaphore&s;is or Swear, in the Time of exce&s;&s;ive Heat, and this is, in a great mea&s;ure, occa&s;ioned by their Ab&s;tinence, ac|cording to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Laws, from Spiritous Liquors, which might &s;uf|ficiently attenuate the Serum of the Blood, and render it apt for Tran|&s;piration, &s;o that when the Ma&s;s of Humours begin to be fermented with Hear, the phlegmatick Parts of the whole are too great in Quanti|ty, and too gro&s;s in Quality to be di&s;charged according to the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature.</P>
<P>But it appear'd lately in <HI>France</HI> without any Mask or Excu&s;e to hide the Evident Cau&s;e of its Malignancy, it plainly appearing to proceed from
<PB N="21" REF="26">Contagious Parts of Matter di&s;per&s;ed through the Air, which, from what hath been &s;aid, appear to be &s;upply'd by Subterraneous Mineral Effluviums, or Vapours, proceeding out of the Bowels of the Earth, Which God Al|mighty pre&s;erve us from!</P>
<P>But it is too much to be feared, that &s;ome Heterogeneous Particles, or Malignant Vapours and Effluviums have, and are, too much di&s;per&s;ed through our Atmo&s;phere, or the Air which we now breathe in our Cli|mate; and this will appear too likely, if we ob&s;erve, that near the whole Twelve Months la&s;t pa&s;t, the Nitrous Parts of the Air have almo&s;t been to|tally overpower'd, and hindered from producing their Natural Effects as u&s;ual in this Climate: For we may ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the la&s;t Sum|mer was not only hot and dry, but that mo&s;t of the la&s;t Winter ap|peared more like Summer than Winter Weather, there being little
<PB N="22" REF="27">appearance of either Fro&s;t or Snow, to what is u&s;ual in this Climate; and we at the pre&s;ent find, that the Heat of the Weather hath &s;ome time exceeded what it hath for &s;everal Years la&s;t pa&s;t, which if it &s;hould encrea&s;e proportionally, as the Sun ap|proaches, it mu&s;t render the hotte&s;t Sea&s;on of the Year exce&s;&s;ively &s;o; and con&s;equently mu&s;t produce ex|ceeding Malignant Di&s;tempers, if not Pe&s;tilential.</P>
<P>And that we may rea&s;onably con|clude, that &s;uch Intemperatures of the Air proceed from Subterraneous Va|pours, or Effluviums, which not only over-power the Nitrous Parts of the Air, but are put and excited into a preternatural Fermentation by the heat of the Sun; I &s;ay, we may rea&s;onably deduce this Conclu&s;ion, &s;ince the Sun would have its con&s;tant and certain effect at the &s;ame Di&s;tance, and con&s;equently, that the Differen|ces mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome Hetero|geneous
<PB N="23" REF="28">Particles, which concur to produce &s;uch Alterations and Differences in the Natural Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air in one Climate.</P>
<P>And that the Air is too much Im|pregnated with &s;ome Heterogeneous Vapours, is evident from the Mala|dies which have lately afflicted &s;everal Per&s;ons, as particular Feveri&s;h Heats and Indi&s;po&s;itions, attended with Pains in the Head and dizzine&s;s, and other Symptoms much different from tho&s;e which appear in Phthi&s;is or any u&s;ual Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>If then, as we may well conclude, or, at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect, the Air we breathe, is impregnated with Heterogeneous Particles, as it &s;eems to appear, not only from what we have mentioned, but the &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing Death of &s;everal Per&s;ons, especially of lare, &s;ince we continually &s;uch in, and imbibe the&s;e Heterogeneous Particles into our Blood in Re&s;piration, it
<PB N="24" REF="29">&s;eems worth our while to con&s;ider what Methods are proper to prevent their ill Effects, it either it &s;hould happen, that the Air &s;hould be more plentifully impregnated with &s;uch Particles, or by long breathing them into our Lungs, the Ma&s;s of Blood &s;hould be more &s;trongly impregnated with them, &s;o as to enable them to produce their ill Effects more vigo|rou&s;ly.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;&s;ign proper Methods to this purpo&s;e, it will be requi&s;ite to con&s;ider, what Cau&s;es commonly concur to produce Malignant Pe&s;ti|lential Di&s;tempers, front whence it will appear, what Methods may be proper and mo&s;t expedient to prevent &s;uch Maladies, and to &s;ecure Man|kind from &s;uch Dangers as may hap|pen, without the over-ruling hand of Providence to divert &s;uch pernicious Qualities which may be more plen|tifully emitted out of the Bowels of
<PB N="25" REF="30">the Earth, and di&s;per&s;ed through the infected Air we breathe in.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, From what hath been &s;aid, it appears &s;ufficiently, that the Antecedent Cau&s;e of Malignant or Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers depends on, and is compo&s;ed of extraneous ma|lignant Mineral Vapours, or Exhala|tions ri&s;ing out of the Bowels of the Earth and Impregnating the Air we breathe with pernicious Particles.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mineral Effluviums or Va|pours, Fir&s;t and Primarily affect Hu|man Bodies, and being &s;ucked into the Lungs in Breathing gradually im|pregnate the whole Ma&s;s of Blood with their Poi&s;onous Steams.</P>
<P>The&s;e Poi&s;onous Particles of Mi|neral Vapours, at the fir&s;t are &s;o &s;mall in quantity, that they are not able to produce any ill Effects, be|ing lodged and harboured among&s;t the more Phlegmatick and gro&s;s Parts
<PB N="26" REF="31">of the Animal Humours; but being gradually collected to a greater quan|tity they exert them&s;elves more powerfully, and the gro&s;s Parts of the Blood being attenuated and &s;ub|tili&s;ed by their corro&s;ive Qualities, or at lea&s;t &s;ome part of them, they are no longer able to cloak and skreen them from &s;hewing their corro&s;ive Qualities.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;s of Blood being thus gradually more &s;trongly impregnated with the&s;e depraved and Heteroge|neous Particles, and &s;ome Parts of the Ma&s;s of Humours attenuated by their corro&s;ive Qualities, they begin to di&s;cover tho&s;e Qualities; run them into a more fluid form by their cor|ro&s;ive Faculty, and &s;eparating them from the re&s;t, the perfect Mixture of the Ma&s;s of Humours is by this means broke, and made an imper|fected Mixture, the gro&s;&s;er Parts be|ing ca&s;t off and &s;eparated from the thinner, and by this means rendered
<PB N="27" REF="32">unapt and unfit for Circulation; the gro&s;&s;er Parts occa&s;ion Ob&s;tructions in the &s;mall and minute&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, whil&s;t the more thin and corro&s;ive corrode and de&s;troy the continuity of the Ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e joint Effects make &s;uch a &s;ad Cata&s;trophe in hu|man Bodies, and putting the whole fabrick into di&s;order, produce tho&s;e ill Symptoms in Pe&s;tilential and Ma|lignat Di&s;tempers; as Tumours, Ulcers, Inflammations, Deliriums, Mortifications and Death: In the Glandulous Parts they produce Buboes, in the fle&s;hy Pares Car|buncles and Blotches, in the Nervous Parts, e&s;pecially the Membranes of the Brain, Inflammation, Delirium and Phren&s;y, in the Glandulous Parts of the Brain, and other noble Parts, violent Symptoms and &s;ud|den Death.</P>
<P>The&s;e Malignant and Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers being thus formed, and the Blood &s;trongly Impregnated with
<PB N="28" REF="33">de&s;tructive Vapours as well as the Air, the Di&s;temper begins to be more contagious and &s;preading; the ill Effluviums heaped up in human Bodies now exerting them&s;elves powerfully, and breaking out of tho&s;e Repo&s;itories, unite with tho&s;e contained in the Air, and more &s;trongly affect tho&s;e Per&s;ons about them; and thus the Infection is &s;pread and promoted Secondarily, the&s;e Effluviums from human Bodies u|niting with tho&s;e contained in the Air, and tho&s;e already collected in the Ma&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e Primary and Secundary Antecedent Cau&s;es to pro|duce Malignant and Pe&s;tilential Di|&s;tempers, there are other acce&s;&s;ory and Concurring Cau&s;es requi&s;ite; for &s;ince all are not equally &s;ubject to them, but &s;everal continue a long time among&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons without prejudice, till at the la&s;t their Con&s;ti|tutions are gradually depraved and
<PB N="29" REF="34">more &s;trongly affected with the Ve|nemous Exhalations.</P>
<P>This Acce&s;&s;ory concurring Cau&s;e, mu&s;t be a particular Di&s;po&s;ition in the Blood, to retain, and be affected by the&s;e Infectious Vapours or Efflu|viums of the Earth, and human Bodies; otherwi&s;e all People would be equally &s;ubject to be Infected at the &s;ame time. To di&s;cover this Di&s;po&s;ition, we are to con&s;ider, that whatever is contained in the Ma&s;s of Blood, as long as is thin enough to circulate through the Ve&s;&s;els, there is no danger of Ob&s;truction, and con|&s;equently there can no, damage happen, except it be too thin, and corro&s;ive, and opening the Extremi|ties, or otherwi&s;e corroding and de|&s;troying the Continuity of the Ve&s;|&s;els occa&s;ions an Extrava&s;ation; but even to produce that Effect, the Hu|mours mu&s;t be very &s;harp before they can break the Ve&s;&s;els, as long as they circulate freely, &s;ince they &s;tay not
<PB N="30" REF="35">long enough in any Part to produce that Effect, and therefore we may well conclude that there mu&s;t be Vi&s;cocity al&s;o in the Blood, and that tho&s;e vi&s;cous Parts being either too thick to circulate, or &s;eparate from the re&s;t, fir&s;t cau&s;e an Ob&s;truction and detain the&s;e corro&s;ive Humours, the perfect Mixture of the Blood be|ing fir&s;t broke and de&s;troy'd by tho&s;e Contagious Parts.</P>
<P>Indeed when the Ve&s;&s;els are too much crouded and extended with Humours, as in Plethorick Bodies, Corro&s;ive Particles crouded and im|pelled by the force of Circulation into the &s;mall Pores of the Ve&s;&s;els, may too much extend them and con|tribute to &s;eparate and divide the continuity of their Parts; but &s;ince there is Naturally a Vi&s;cocity in the Blood and Serum, and this may be, and frequently is too great; this u|nited with tho&s;e Corro&s;ive Qualities, and retaining them, will give them
<PB N="31" REF="36">a greater opportunity of Corro&s;ion. Thus a Vi&s;cous Phlegm retaining a &s;harp Humour upon the Top of the Stomach or Ventricle, where there is a plentiful Di&s;tribution of Nerves, cau&s;es a corroding Pain at the Sto|mach, called Heart-burn; and in the Membranes, about the Mu&s;culous Parts, occa&s;ions Rheu|matick Pains, e&s;pecially where they are mo&s;t Sen&s;ible and incapable of Exten&s;ion; and the Membranes of the Joints corroded with a &s;harp or Au|&s;tere Vi&s;cous Matter produce tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Pains of the Gout, where the Ob&s;truction &s;o much retains tho&s;e &s;harp Humours that they corrode the Ve&s;&s;els in pieces, and occa&s;ion &s;uch an extrava&s;ation of this Vi&s;cous Matter as to produce and form Nodes.</P>
<P>From hence it plainly appearing that a predi&s;po&s;ition in the Blood is an accer&s;&s;ory concurring Cau&s;e, and that this predi&s;po&s;ed Humour, is a
<PB N="32" REF="37">Vi&s;cous gro&s;s Humour, which retains and heaps up the Contagious Par|ticles of the Air we imbibe, and draw in with our Breath, it con|&s;equently follows, that the Conjunct Cau&s;e, or Matter of the Di&s;ea&s;e is, Contagious Particles lodged fir&s;t in a Vi&s;cous Humour, which was an acce&s;&s;ory Antecedent Cau&s;e, and di&s;engaged or &s;eparated from the &s;harp Humour, and cau&s;ing Ob|&s;tructions, becomes along with that &s;harp Contagious Humour, a Con|junct Cau&s;e, and both together make up the Material Cau&s;e, or the Mor|bifick Matter of the Di&s;order and Di&s;temper, which according to the Degrees, produces more Malignant Di&s;ea&s;es, and when abounding in an extraordinary! degree, even the Pe&s;ti|lence, which is &s;o obnoxious and fa|tal to Mankind.</P>
<P>And that a Vi&s;cous Matter, along with the Contagious Particles, is the Conjunct Cau&s;e, and produces Ma|lignant
<PB N="33" REF="38">and Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers, is evident from hence, &s;ince all Peo|ple are not equally &s;ubject to &s;uch Di&s;tempers, and &s;ome never have any at all, though they live in a Contagious Air, and among&s;t In|fected Per&s;ons; and that a Vi&s;cous predi&s;po&s;ition of Blood is nece&s;&s;ary as a concurring Cau&s;e is manife&s;t; for as long as the Humours are &s;uf|ficiently attenuated, though &s;harp corro&s;ive Particles are imbibed into the Blood, and mixed with it in Re&s;piration, they are &s;oon di&s;charged and &s;eparated from it again, by the common Emunctories and di&s;charges of Nature, as by Sweat, Tran&s;pi|ration, Urine or Stool, before they can have any time or power to alter and corrupt the Blood by de&s;troying its Texture and Mixture, for the con&s;tant Agitation and Circulation of the Blood pre&s;erves its Mixture along time when kept in perpetual Motion; but when the Blood is too thick it retains a greater Quan|tity,
<PB N="34" REF="39">hinders the Natural Di&s;charge, and con&s;equently tends to heap up Infectious Particles.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, when the Blood abounds with Vi&s;cous Parts, it produces a larger Di&s;charge or Separation of Phlegmatick Parts, when its Texture and Mixture is imperfect, which oc|ca&s;ion Ob&s;tructions, and concur to produce Malignant Symptoms, when thrown Critically upon the minute Ve&s;&s;els or Glands of any Part.</P>
<P>When any &s;uch Critical Di&s;charge is made, and a Malignant or Pe&s;ti|lential Di&s;temper is formed, and properly in <HI>e&s;&s;e</HI> or <HI>factu,</HI> that is, per|fectly formed, the Antecedent, con|junct and Acce&s;&s;ory Cau&s;es along with the Symptoms produced, make up the formal Cau&s;e, which is the Di&s;ea&s;e and its Symptoms.</P>
<P>But to compleat this, there is one Cau&s;e acce&s;&s;ory, which is the Proca|tartick
<PB N="35" REF="40">Cau&s;e, or that which puts the Antecedent Cau&s;es in Action; as any &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ion of the Mind, and the ill u&s;e of Non-Naturals, or the force of Imagination; but that which is chiefly &s;o and External, is the approaching Heat and Activity of the Sun Beams, which put tho&s;e Contagious Effluviums, Vapours or Exhalations, in Action more briskly, by encrea&s;ing the Degrees of Fer|mentation or Dige&s;tion, the Con&s;e|quence of which we may ju&s;tly fear and dread; for if &s;uch Conta|gious Effluviums are in the Air, and &s;hould encrea&s;e, it may rea&s;onably be feared, that Contagious Di&s;tem|pers may happen more or le&s;s Ma|lignant, if not Pe&s;tilential, accord|ing to the Degrees of the Primary Antecedent Cau&s;e, <HI>Viz.</HI> Extraneous Mineral Exhalations, Vapours or Effluviums, from which God Al|mighty, or Art, mu&s;t pre&s;erve us, if they &s;hould by the cour&s;e of Natu|ral Cau&s;es break forth.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="41">
<P>From what hath been &s;aid, it appears what ju&s;t cau&s;e we have to dread the ill Con&s;equences of Contagious Vapours, which we may too rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect. It may therefore be requi&s;ite to con|&s;ider, what Methods are mo&s;t proper to prevent and avert the E|vent, and Con&s;equences of &s;uch dreadful Cau&s;es; which may ea&s;ily be deduced from what hath been &s;aid: For if Contagious Vapours are retained by a Vi&s;cous Indi&s;po|&s;ition of Blood, and &s;harp Cor|ro&s;ive Humours or Vapours, col|lected and run into a Fluor, de&s;troy the Texture and Mixture of the Blood, and by this Means produce the Symptoms of Malignant or Pe&s;ti|lential Di&s;tempers, the proper In|tentions to prevent &s;uch Accidents, mu&s;t be to Correct and Di&s;charge that Vi&s;cous Matter which retains Contagious Vapours, as well as to correct and prevent the ill Effects of tho&s;e Infectious Effluviums; it being
<PB N="37" REF="42">impo&s;&s;ible either to prevent Mineral Exhalations, which is the Primary Antecedent Cau&s;e, or to hinder and ob&s;truct the Sun's approach, which is the Principal Procatartick Cau&s;e, though &s;ometimes the Antecedent Cau&s;e, when encrea&s;ed to a great Degree, and plentifully heaped up, may al&s;o be a Procatartick Cau&s;e, and put it &s;elf in Action.</P>
<P>Since then the Principal Intentions to prevent Malignant or Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers are to remove the Na|tural Indi&s;po&s;ition, which retains Contagious Vapours, and to correct tho&s;e Vapours, or Malignant Par|ticles which de&s;troy the Texture of the Blood, and produce &s;uch fatal Con&s;equences, we are to con&s;ider what is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to be done.</P>
<P>As for the Air, it is of &s;uch va&s;t Extent, and the Superficies of the Earth &s;o large, that it will be hard to deal with &s;o exten&s;ive a Subject
<PB N="38" REF="43">Phy&s;ically, but in the Compa&s;s of a human Body we may be more likely to deal with them.</P>
<P>As for the Predi&s;po&s;ition of the Blood which renders human Bodies mo&s;t likely to retain them, and to heap up Contagious Particles, &s;ince that is a Vi&s;cous Humour, it is obvious to tho&s;e who have taken Pains in Phy&s;ick, what Intentions are requi&s;ite to that purpo&s;e; as Bleeding and Purging, for Bleeding emptying the Ve&s;&s;els makes room for Fluids to dilute and thin the re&s;t, and Purging di&s;charges a gro&s;&s;er Hu|mour than pa&s;&s;es off by any other Natural way, which Nature makes u&s;e of.</P>
<P>And to correct tho&s;e Contagious Vapours which may already be heaped up in the Blood, or may hereafter be contracted, &s;ince they wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d pa&s;s off, if nothing was in the Way to ob&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uct them, without
<PB N="39" REF="44">de&s;troying the Texture of the Blood, &s;ince thin Humours flow be&s;t off by Diaphore&s;is, or through the Pores of the Skin, when the gro&s;s Humours are removed by Bleeding and Purge|ing Alexipharmick Diaphoreticks, &s;eem mo&s;t proper for that purpo&s;e, which may correct tho&s;e Malignant Vapours and di&s;charge them, and con&s;equently pre&s;erve the Texture and due Mixture of the Blood, and prevent tho&s;e Malignant and fatal Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>As for particular forms for this purpo&s;e, I need not direct Phy&s;icians, they being able to pre&s;cribe for them&s;elves; but every Body not being Phy&s;icians, or able, or willing to employ them, as too expen&s;ive, I &s;hall recommend &s;ome Medicines convenient for that purpo&s;e, to the u&s;e of tho&s;e who think it worth their while to pre&s;erve their Health, and guard them&s;elves from future ill Con&s;equences.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="45">
<P>And, as I &s;aid before, it may not be ami&s;s to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures, for they will at lea&s;t have this advantage, that if Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers hap|pen not; they will &s;till guard them|&s;elves from the Dangers of Malig|nant Di&s;tempers, which will be worth their while, and reward their Care of their Health, and pre&s;eve a good Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Indeed for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who cannot afford to imploy a Phy&s;ician I &s;hould have laid down forms for their u&s;e, that they might apply them&s;elves to Apothecaries, but &s;ome of them are too apt to adulte|rate Medicines, and leave out any Ingredients that are dear, though mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary; be&s;ides in the &s;everal Books I have already writ, I have been &s;o free that way, that &s;everal, though they have made u&s;e of them to their Advantage, yet they have not had the Civility to acknowledge the freedom, in a way
<PB N="41" REF="46">cu&s;tomary to tho&s;e who have been educated in Phy&s;ick, though it hath been the whole bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;tudy of my Life, &s;ince I left School Edu|cation.</P>
<P>If therefore any one &s;hall think it worth their while to take care of their Health, and guard them&s;elves from future ill Con&s;equences, after Bleeding to attenuate the Humours, to di&s;charge the Vi&s;cous Humour, though I hate any thing that looks like common Quackery, not|with&s;tanding the Art of Phy&s;ick was built upon it, I &s;hall recom|mend particular Medicines for that purpo&s;e already prepared, with Di|rections for their U&s;e. Yet if any &s;hall apply them&s;elves to me for Advi&s;e, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to pre|&s;cribe, let them make u&s;e of who they plea&s;e. But to proceed from this accidental Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The propere&s;t Purge which I &s;hould recommend upon this occa|&s;ion, is Dr. <HI>Sagittary</HI>'s Elixir, a Me|dicine
<PB N="42" REF="47">of Excellent U&s;e, and di&s;|charging obnoxious Humours with a great deal of Safety. This ought to be taken once or twice a Week, working gently, and by making a gradual di&s;charge without too much force upon Nature, and therefore mo&s;t agreeable to human Bodies; I have no Intere&s;t in recommending this Excellent Medicine, but only the good of Mankind.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Days which are free from Purging, they may take an <HI>Anti-ma|lignant</HI> and <HI>Antipe&s;tilential Tincture,</HI> which will correct tho&s;e Contagious Vapours, and expel them out of the Blood, gently through the Pores of the Skin, without the trouble or force of immoderate Sweat, or any &s;en&s;ible &s;weating at all, taking a Spoonful every Morning, and at Night going to Bed, in a Gla&s;s of Wine and Water, or Wine only, or in Beer, if any &s;hall like it ra|ther.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="48">

<P>And that the Small-Pox depends on a particular Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air, which de&s;troys the due mixture of the Ma&s;s of Blood, and makes an Alteration in its Texture is very evident, &s;ince we &s;ee, that this Di&s;|ea&s;e is often times Epidemical, and rages more univer&s;ally at one time than another.</P>
<P>And that the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air, in this Ca&s;e, de&s;troys the Tex|ture of the Blood, appears from the Symptoms of it, for we &s;ee, that the gro&s;&s;er Particles of the Blood, in
<PB N="45" REF="50">that Di&s;ea&s;e, are not only &s;eparated from the re&s;t, but that they are cri|tically ca&s;t off in the Glands of the Skin; which evidently appears, &s;ince as the Air is impregnated with par|ticular Vapours, milder, or more &s;harp and biteing, the Pox are of a benign kind, or Corro&s;ive, and oc|ca&s;ion Pits, or Exulcerations which leave disfiguring Marks behind them.</P>
<P>But in this Di&s;temper there is not only a depraved Indi&s;po&s;ition in the Air, but likewi&s;e a Predi&s;po&s;ition in the Ma&s;s of Humours is requi&s;ite which from the Symptoms appears to be Vi&s;cous, and to depend per|haps on the faults of Dige&s;tion, and Crudities thus conge&s;ted in their Infancy, but this we have not time or room to con&s;ider thoroughly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that to prevent this Di&s;temper the Purgeing Elixir may be u&s;ed once a Week, and the Tincture before-mentioned tho&s;e Days that are free from Purgeing, and for &s;ome time after, which are al&s;o
<PB N="46" REF="51">frequently to be repeated; the Quan|tity to be proportioned according to the Per&s;on's Age, Directions for which will be given along with that Tincture.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Differences of Contagious Vapours.</HI></P>
<P>Since in the foregoing Sheets we have taken Notice, that Malignant and Contagious Di&s;tempers depend on, and are occa&s;ioned by pernicious Vapours and Exhalations ri&s;ing out of the Bowels or the Superficial Parts of the Earth, impregnating the Air we breathe, and acting upon Bodies pre|indi&s;po&s;ed, and furni&s;hed with Viti|ous depraved Humours; we &s;hall briefly add &s;omething of the differ|ences of tho&s;e Contagious Vapours and Exhalations which produce the&s;e different Effects; the Effects varying, as we before took notice, according to the variety of the Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t Watry Exhalations ren|der the Air thick and moi&s;t, and ob|noxious to Athmatick Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e that have moi&s;t Lungs; the&s;e

Malig|nant Fevers depend on a higher degree of corro&s;ive Mineral Salts, producing a higher degree of Crudities, and much more than Nature can dige&s;t; throw off or di&s;charge. In Pe&s;tilen|tial Di&s;tempers the Effluviums are of a more Malignant kind, and rather of an Ar&s;enical Nature, producing Symptoms of a proportionable De|gree of Malignancy and more per|nicious.</P>
