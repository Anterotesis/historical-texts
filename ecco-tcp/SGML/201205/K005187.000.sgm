<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement.</HEAD>
<P>AS early as the year 1733, I read the following di&s;&s;erta|tion on <HI>Hermaphrodites,</HI> at a pub|lick meeting of the Academy of Surgery. Though it &s;eemed equally to take with the people of the art, and the learned of all denomina|tions who honoured the a&s;&s;embly with their pre&s;ence, I thought pro|per however to defer the publica|tion: at that time being too young, and but ju&s;t beginning to enter up|on the practice of hernia's, which requiring a great deal of circum|&s;pection, and a delicacy of manners, a work of this &s;ort could not fail of expo&s;ing my character to the cen&s;ure and malice of my enemies.
<PB N="iv" REF="3">It was nece&s;&s;ary therefore to &s;up|pre&s;s it; it now has lain by me for eighteen years, and would have lain &s;till longer, had it not been for &s;ome circum&s;tances which pre|vail with me to publi&s;h it.</P>
<P>There appeared in <HI>London,</HI> ten years ago, a girl of bad &s;tructure as to the parts of generation, who pa&s;&s;ed for an Hermaphrodite; &s;he in that re&s;pect impo&s;ed upon the curious. Dr. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> publi&s;hed in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a book intituled, <HI>A mecha|nical and critical inquiry into the nature of Hermaphrodites.</HI> This work undeceived the world as to the fal&s;e notion it had entertained in regard to this creature. Ano|ther &s;ort of per&s;on of the male kind, and lately arrived here, gives room to di&s;putes about his &s;tate; &s;ome affirming, others denying, it to be hermaphrodital. People go &s;till farther, and a&s;k them&s;elves, Whether really there be genuine
<PB N="v" REF="4">Hermaphrodites or no? Some pre|tend there may be, others would prove there are none. Tho&s;e build on the opinions of authors, who have proved their exi&s;tence; the&s;e employ the arguments, which other authors have oppo&s;ed to the for|mer. From all the&s;e rea&s;onings there appear to re&s;ult but vague and confu&s;ed ideas, which &s;till leave the problem unre&s;olved.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign is not to decide this controver&s;y, my only view is to expo&s;e the facts on each &s;ide, which have given room to the di&s;putes that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for upwards of two thou&s;and years, upon this &s;ub|ject. I have confined my&s;elf, as much as po&s;&s;ible, within the &s;tricte&s;t limits; I thought that it was better to in&s;truct by amu&s;ing, than to tire out by in&s;tructing. In giving a &s;ummary relation of the opinions of authors, I afford &s;ati&s;faction enough to the learned; the curious will a&s;k
<PB N="vi" REF="5">for no more. To &s;upport the opi|nion of the ancients, I &s;hall relate the mo&s;t authentick ob&s;ervations of our days, made by modern practi|tioners who are &s;till living: I have added the hi&s;tory of an anomolous per&s;on, whom I have my&s;elf ob|&s;erved. And here I &s;hall obviate an objection, which the criticks will be &s;ure to &s;tart upon this ob|&s;ervation; they will &s;ay, it is too long; a fault which &s;ome per&s;ons have upbraided me with, in regard to my di&s;&s;ertation on hernia's. To this I an&s;wer, that ob&s;ervations can never be too circum&s;tantial; and that it is a defect, common both to the ancients and moderns, to be too little circum&s;tantial in relating of facts: and this accounts for our deriving &s;o little benefit from the numerous volumes of ob&s;ervations left us by the ancients. Why then do not the moderns, who expect to be read, correct the faults they
<PB N="vii" REF="6">find in tho&s;e who have gone before them?</P>
<P>To avoid the reproaches that might be made me in regard to the pa&s;&s;ages which I have been obliged to quote from the Latin poets, I have &s;oftened, in the tran&s;lation, the freedom of the original, with|out altering any thing in the ge|nuine &s;en&s;e of the authors.</P>
<P>As to the plates, which might convey along with them, to the minds of &s;ome, a character of ob|&s;cenity, they are taken from the authors; and if there is any diffe|rence, it is only in the delicacy of the execution; a mark of the ge|nero&s;ity of the book&s;eller, who has been at that expence.</P>
<P>As my de&s;ign is to enlarge this &s;ubject with the greate&s;t number of ob&s;ervations I can po&s;&s;ibly collect, I take this occa&s;ion to invite per|&s;ons
<PB N="viii" REF="7">of the art acquainted with &s;i|milar ca&s;es, to communicate them, in order to their being put toge|ther into a new edition of this work, which their genero&s;ity would encourage. The authors will be no lo&s;ers, the publick great gainers; e&s;pecially if the ob&s;ervations are ac|companied with cuts.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of par|ticular facts in relation to hernia's, are al&s;o entreated to communicate them, to be put in their proper places in the new edition of <HI>The compleat treati&s;e of Hernia's,</HI> which I propo&s;e to publi&s;h in quarto next year.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON HERMAPHRODITES.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introduction.</NOTE>WHATEVER degree of accuracy and wi&s;dom nature employs in the compo&s;ition and frame of the human body, we have oftener than once &s;een her &s;werve from the&s;e, and, as it were, forget her&s;elf; oftener than once, in&s;tead of regarding that con&s;truction, that order, tho&s;e proportions of the organs, whence re&s;ults that perfect harmony, which forms the object of our admiration, &s;he has exhibited irregular, vicious, and un|&s;eemly conformations of parts. It &s;hould &s;eem, to &s;peak the language of a certain author, that this common parent, tired out and &s;pent with producing every day the &s;ame things, over and over, in the &s;ame order, did now and then quit that
<PB N="10" REF="9">uniformity, and throw into her producti|ons a variety but little conformable to her laws. Sometimes &s;he with-holds from a body the parts the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; in ano|ther &s;ubject, &s;he is plea&s;ed to multiply them, often allots them &s;ituations, con|nections, and dimen&s;ions, the mo&s;t extra|ordinary and fanta&s;tical; &s;he &s;eparates what, according to her own laws, &s;hould be joined, and joins what ought to remain &s;eparate: hence ari&s;e tho&s;e deformities in the &s;trokes or features, tho&s;e members ill-articulated, tho&s;e di&s;proportions, tho&s;e im|perfections of organical parts, and tho&s;e combinations, &s;o mon&s;trous and out of the common road, that it is with difficulty we di&s;cover nature even in nature her&s;elf. Among the <HI>lu&s;us naturae,</HI> which are exhi|bited to us under different forms, &s;ome are of a peculiar &s;pecies, which cannot fail of exciting our curio&s;ity or compa&s;&s;ion, and which art can never pretend to correct. There are others, on the contrary, which call for all the attention of the &s;urgeon, and in which his under&s;tanding and dexterity be|come of extraordinary u&s;e; who leaving to the bare &s;peculative phy&s;ician, the painful but honourable province of finding out the my&s;terious cau&s;es, his principal concern is to
<PB N="11" REF="10">lend a helping-hand to tho&s;e who are thus di&s;figured by nature; he omits nothing in his power to redre&s;s and &s;et her to-rights again, by prudent and &s;kilful operations; and &s;ometimes he is happy enough to &s;uc|ceed, either by retrenching u&s;ele&s;s and &s;u|perfluous parts, or by joining tho&s;e which are &s;eparated, or &s;eparating tho&s;e which are joined again&s;t the order of nature, or by laying tho&s;e open and bare, which are concealed and covered. Daily practice furni&s;hes examples enough, to prove that I advance nothing at random: but that I may confine my&s;elf within the li|mits pre&s;cribed, I &s;hall re&s;t &s;ati&s;fied with giving proof thereof, by reciting an ob&s;er|vation concerning an hermaphrodite, after having given a general idea of the different &s;orts of people of faulty &s;tructure of the parts of generation, who have been con&s;i|dered by certain authors as hermaphro|dites, of which others formally deny the exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Etymo|logy of the term herma|phrodite.</NOTE>By the term <HI>hermaphrodite,</HI> we under|&s;tand him or her, in whom the parts, which form the e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween the two &s;exes, are found together, either perfectly or imperfectly. It is de|rived
<PB N="12" REF="11">rived from the greek, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;igni|fying to be made up, or con&s;i&s;t of Mer|cury and Venus. In Ovid we find the fa|bulous hi&s;tory which has given ri&s;e to that &s;ignification;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herma|phrodite; its origin.</NOTE> he makes Hermaphroditus to be the &s;on of Mercury and Venus; who, &s;ays he, was of &s;o perfect a beauty, that the nymph Salmacis fell de&s;perately in love with him one day, as he happened to be wa&s;hing in a fountain where &s;he pre&s;ided; enraged for being unable to make him &s;en|&s;ible of her pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he prayed the gods to join them together in &s;uch a manner, that their two bodies &s;hould make but one, in which, however, the two &s;exes &s;hould remain accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed; this fa|vour was granted:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Nec duo junt, &s;ed forma duplex, nec foe|mina dici</L>
<L>Nec puer ut po&s;&s;int: neutrumque &amp; utrum|que videntur.</L>
</LG>
<P>"They are not two, yet the form is twofold; we cannot &s;ay, that it is the body of a boy or of a girl; they are nei|ther, though they appear to be both."</P></Q>
<P>The ancient poets, fruitful in fictions, underneath that veil concealed truths,
<PB N="13" REF="12">which happy geniu&s;es have &s;kilfully un|veiled, by interpretations either moral or political. But the &s;equel of this di&s;|cour&s;e will po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve to ju&s;tify tho&s;e who imagine, that the veil which covers the truth in this fable, may be &s;een through. For may we not from this fiction infer (as M. Mertru<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mercure de Franc. du Mois de Fevr. 1750. Edit. Lond.</NOTE>, who in this agrees with the Abbe de Bellegarde<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Auteur des Explic. &s;ur les Metamorph d'Ovide. Edit. de la Haye. 1735.</NOTE>, &s;ays) that</P>
<Q><P>"the anci|ents had a knowledge of the union of the two &s;exes in one and the &s;ame per&s;on; and that this fanta&s;ticalne&s;s of nature, is the origin of the fiction related by Ovid in his metamorpho&s;es."</P>
<P>"Ovid has feigned," &s;ays the Abbe de Bellegarde, "that Hermaphroditus was the &s;on of Mercury and Venus, upon the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome naturali&s;ts, who have remarked, that the children, who are born during the conjunction of the&s;e two planets, are &s;ometimes hermaphro|dites, and partake of both &s;exes."</P></Q>
<P>The Greeks have, moreover, called the&s;e fort of creatures <HI>androgynes,</HI> a term which
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;eems to be more &s;ignificant, in that it is derived from the two words <GAP DESC="foreign">, which denotes a man, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, a woman. We however will u&s;e that of hermaphrodite, as being more common or popular.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">m that A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">am was an herma|phrodite.</NOTE>I will not engage in the di&s;putes of &s;ome rabbins, who have given out that Adam was an hermaphrodite, prior to his fall, and that he was created with a view to continue in that &s;tate. On this head may be read Ga&s;par Bauhin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ari&s;totle'&s; opinion on herma|phrodites.</NOTE>Hermaphrodites have been allowed of by &s;o great a number of authors, that &s;ome people have no manner of doubt of their exi&s;tence. Ari&s;totle would &s;eem to prove their evidence by the recital he makes of them: he relates &s;uch peculiarities of them, as are admired by &s;ome, and laughed at by others. I here pretend not to fix the judg|ment of the reader, every one is at liberty to &s;ettle his ideas according to the extent of his under&s;tanding; my aim only is to relate the authorities of tho&s;e who merit our attention: I &s;hall neither conte&s;t nor prove that Ari&s;totle has talked idly, or with rea&s;on affirmed, that &s;ome herma|phrodites had the right brea&s;t like that of
<PB N="15" REF="14">a man, and the left like that of a woman, and that they changed nature alternately; that may or may not be, 'tis what I will not determine; nature &s;hews every day &s;ingularities too &s;urpri&s;ing to attempt en|gaging in that di&s;pute with Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambro&s;e Pareus'&s; opinion on herma|phrodites.</NOTE>Ambro&s;e Pareus, who had &s;tudied nature like a true &s;urgeon, gives much more clear and preci&s;e ideas of them than Ari&s;totle, by the divi&s;ion he has made, which at once gives us a true notion: he has given us &s;everal figures, among which is that of two hermaphrodites, twins, which came into the world joined by the back; fig. 1. plate II.</P>
<P>The be&s;t authors who have treated this matter &s;ince Pareus, have followed his di|vi&s;ion; as Ga&s;par Bauhin, who has writ a particular treati&s;e, which is very ample, and &s;o learned, that there are few works in any kind of natural hi&s;tory, &s;o full of erudition. Duval, phy&s;ician at Rouen, fol|lows al&s;o Pareus's divi&s;ion. The author of the <HI>Tableau de l'amour con&s;ider&eacute; dans l'&ecirc;tat du marriage,</HI> has al&s;o allotted for them a peculiar chapter, con&s;iderable and ample enough, following al&s;o Pareus's plan, ba|ting
<PB N="16" REF="15">a few things: he however engages in explanations which are very ab&s;tracted and vague. Martinus Schurigius, in his Sper|matologia hi&s;torico-medica, gives very &s;in|gular in&s;tances of them, and follows al&s;o the divi&s;ion of Pareus.</P>
<P>The&s;e authors, and others who have gone before them, as Hippocrates, Ga|len, Realdus Columbus, Paulus AEgineta, Fortunius Licetus, and others, have un|dertaken to explain what they imagined might have given occa&s;ion to the genera|tion of hermaphrodites (tho&s;e they took for &s;uch) but what they have left us on this head, contains nothing intere&s;ting enough to claim our attention: and as all I could my&s;elf advance, could not give half the &s;atisfaction that the demon&s;tration of facts affords, as nature lays them before our eyes, I pa&s;s on therefore to the divi|&s;ion of the different &s;pecies of hermaphro|dites.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ion of herma|phrodites.</NOTE>They are divided into four &s;pecies, namely, the male hermaphrodite, plate I. fig. 2; the female hermaphrodite, plate I. fig. 1; the perfect hermaphrodite, plate II. fig. 1, 2, 3; the imperpect hermaphro|dite, plate III.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e four &s;pecies of herma|phrodites, there is a particular &s;ort of per|&s;ons of bad formation of the parts of ge|neration, to which we cannot a&s;cribe any character of hermaphrodite; of which plate IV. may &s;erve to give a general idea: I &s;hall give in&s;tances thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Male herma|phrodite.</NOTE>The male hermaphrodite is he in whom the parts of generation of the man are perfect, both in dimen&s;ions, figure, and ac|tions; and in whom the parts of the wo|man err through &s;ome peculiarities, as when the vagina is not open enough to admit the penis; and that there is only an imperceptible outlet for the di&s;charge of the men&s;trual blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Female herma|phrodite.</NOTE>The female hermaphrodite is &s;he who has all the parts of the woman fit for ge|neration, and in whom the appearances of virility are imperfect. This &s;pecies is characteri&s;ed by tho&s;e women in whom the clitoris is di&s;engaged or free (for in the natural &s;tate, tho' it is, indeed, con&s;iderably &s;welled in the venereal act, yet it never quits its place to become erected; &s;ee plate IV. fig. 1.) and which having the &s;ame
<PB N="18" REF="17">figure with the penis of the man, yet with|out being perforated like it, makes them almo&s;t re&s;emble eunuchs, who can enjoy coition without the perfect con&s;ummation of the venereal act. The Greeks called the&s;e women <GAP DESC="foreign">, whence comes, I imagine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ribaude, what.</NOTE> the old French word <HI>ribaude,</HI> which &s;ignifies a lewd woman; &s;uch was the famous Sappho. Martial writ the fol|lowing epigram on occa&s;ion of a certain young woman of this &s;pecies, who pa&s;&s;ed for virtuous for &s;ome time, becau&s;e &s;he had never ventured her cha&s;tity with the men:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>E&s;&s;e videbaris, fateor, Lucretia nobis,</L>
<L>At tu, pro facinus! Ba&s;&s;a fututor eras.</L>
<L>Inter &s;e geminos audes committere cunnos,</L>
<L>Mentitur&abque; virum prodigio&s;a Venus.</L>
<L>Commenia es dignum Thebano aenigmate mon&s;trum,</L>
<L>Hic, ubi vir non e&s;t, ut &s;it adulterium!</L>
</LG>
<P>"I own, Ba&s;&s;a, I had all along taken you for a virtuous per&s;on; but, O infa|mous! you played the whore-ma&s;ter, and had the impudence to act the part of a man with your own &s;ex, and make your&s;elf pa&s;s for one; a prodigy worthy the Theban riddle, that adultery may
<PB N="19" REF="18">be committed without the intervention of a man!"</P></Q>
<P>Some years ago a girl of this &s;ort was confined at Paris, becau&s;e &s;he went about in men's cloaths, and was di&s;charged out of pri&s;on, on condition of going dre&s;&s;ed like a woman, which &s;he did with much re|gret. The&s;e &s;ort of women are pretty rare in Europe, but were formerly very com|mon in Egypt; and when they were to be married, care was taken to cut the cli|toris, to prevent its being trouble&s;ome to the hu&s;band. Aetius and Paulus AEgineta give the method of performing this ope|ration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The per|fect her|maphro|dite.</NOTE>The perfect hermaphrodite, according to the relation of certain authors, is where we find the parts of generation of both &s;exes, with both the active and pa&s;&s;ive power. Albertus &s;ays that there are her|maphrodites who are both <HI>incubi</HI> and <HI>&s;uc|cubi</HI> in coition, and yet incapable of gene|rating or conceiving: wherefore nice and &s;crupulous authors con&s;ider the&s;e as im|perfect hermaphrodites.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The true character of the per|fect her|maphro|dite.</NOTE>They would have the parts of both &s;exes, each in particular, to have the ge|nuine character which con&s;titutes their e&s;|&s;ence: for if there are &s;ome which are faulty, through a vice of action or propor|tion, they accordingly cla&s;s the &s;ubject with the male or female hermaphrodites.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the exterior parts &s;eems to be of no importance to their fa|culties, and changes nothing in the &s;pecies. It has been ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome the parts are placed contiguous to each other; &s;ee plate II. fig. 1 and 3. Others there are, in which they are placed one above the other; &s;ometimes tho&s;e of the man have the fir&s;t place; &s;ometimes, tho&s;e of the woman predominate; &s;ee plate II. fig. 2.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo&s;t natural order.</NOTE> But the mo&s;t perfect di&s;po&s;ition, in my opinion, is that which makes no al|teration in the natural &s;ituation of the parts; as when the penis occupies the place of the clitoris, and the two te&s;ticles are inclo&s;ed in the lips of the vulva, as they would be in the &s;crotum, if divided into two equal parts, as may be remarked in plate I. fig. 2.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The opi|nions di|vided as to the exi&s;t|ence of genuine herma|phrodites.</NOTE>The opinions have at all times been di|vided in regard to the exi&s;tence of this &s;pe|cies of hermaphrodites. Hippocrates, Ga|len, Licubantius, Paulus Zacchias, Fabri|cius ab Aquapendente, and &s;ome other au|thors, knew of no &s;uch &s;pecies; and from thence it is they di&s;avowed them, in like manner as &s;ome philo&s;ophers did: yet Ari|&s;totle, &s;everal hi&s;torians, and &s;ome phy&s;ical authors, relate in&s;tances of them, which &s;eem guarded with all the characters of truth; and there is, even in the Talmud, a law for them, compri&s;ing &s;everal articles, and from which lawyers have taken their authorities to re&s;train the&s;e people.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;t autho|rity, tend|ing to prove the exi&s;tence of perfect herma|phodires.</NOTE>Every body knows the horror where|with &s;uper&s;tition had in&s;pired the Romans again&s;t the&s;e &s;ort of per&s;ons, who, by the laws of the Aru&s;pices, were condemned to be drowned &s;ome years after their birth, becau&s;e they were con&s;idered as mon&s;ters by the decree of Romulus; but in the time of Pliny they laid a&s;ide that unju&s;t prejudice, as he proves by the&s;e words: <HI>Gignuntur utriu&s;&abque; &s;exus quos hermaphro|ditas vocamus, olim androgynos vocatos, &amp;

Many of the mo&s;t celebrated &s;urgeons were of my opinion; but as we agreed to perform that operation at a time the tumour of the pe|rineum &s;hould appear, the patient went away home &s;ome miles from Paris, and was five or &s;ix months gone.

The mo&s;t favourable time for performing the operation, had been a month after, when the tumour was to re-appear; but the patient could only &s;tay fifteen or twenty days at Paris: I was then obliged to avail my&s;elf of that time of nece&s;&s;ity.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opera|tion; in what manner perform|ed.</NOTE>I cau&s;ed the patient to lie on the &s;ide of a bed, her legs being &s;upported on the knees of two of the con&s;ultants, who held her thighs a&s;under. I pinched the &s;kin, which covered the vagina, tran&s;ver&s;ely, with the thumb and forefinger of my left-hand; Mr. Guerin laid hold al&s;o with his fingers on the &s;ame fold, on the &s;ide oppo|&s;ite to that which I held; I afterwards cut that &s;kin with a &s;trait bi&s;tory, by de|&s;cribing a line perpendicular to the anus; at one &s;troke I came to a &s;ort of cellular texture, which I took hold on with a hook, and which I afterwards cut with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. I conveyed my finger into the aperture, which procured me the divi&s;ion of the cellular texture; it entered without any re&s;i&s;tance into a void or empty &s;pace, which was con&s;idered by tho&s;e of the con|&s;ultants, who put their finger into it, as the cavity of the vagina. This cavity &s;eemed to us to have two or three inches
<PB N="40" REF="39">in depth, and about two in circumference. I filled it with &s;everal t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ps of lint, tied with thread. On the following day I &s;ub|&s;tituted, for the taps of lint, a tent of 3 &frac12; inches long, and one in diameter. On the &s;ixth day of the operation, Mr. Verdier and I felt, at the end of the finger, an eminence at the bottom of the vagina,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ma|trix di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the touch.</NOTE> which appeared to us to be the orifice of the part of the matrix which enters into the vagina. From the &s;ixth day after the operation, the patient was not dre&s;&s;ed for twenty-five days that &s;he &s;tayed at Paris, but with a very large tent made of prepa|red &s;punge, which was never charged with purulent matter but at the parts, which an&s;wered to the aperture of the &s;kin, who&s;e edges &s;uppurated a very long time. I gave pieces of prepared &s;punge to the patient to u&s;e her&s;elf. Some days after getting home, the blood of the cour&s;es came out at the aperture which I had made for it, without a &s;ingle drop pa&s;&s;ing by the fundament; &s;he had al&s;o none of the &s;ymptoms, to which &s;he had been formerly &s;ubject, only for five or &s;ix hours before the flux, &s;he had colick pains like tho&s;e &s;he had always had upon her. The evacuation la&s;ted only three days; during which time the patient
<PB N="41" REF="40">di&s;continued the u&s;e of the &s;punge, as I had directed her, and continued it after|wards. Five weeks after, the blood re-appeared &s;till by the &s;ame part, and flowed for three or four days. The patient imagi|ned then &s;he might be without the &s;punge. The fi&s;tulous orifice, that is to &s;ay, the aperture which I had made, appeared to be clo&s;ed up; yet it opened on the third month to give pa&s;&s;age to the blood, when it was about to re-appear. This happened &s;till for two months longer; but on the &s;ixth month the blood re&s;umed its cour&s;e by the fundament, and all the &s;ymptoms, to which the patient had been &s;ubject before the operation, recurred upon her afre&s;h. She thus &s;uffered &s;ilently, without acquainting me for eight or ten months; at the end of which time &s;he con&s;ulted me: I had no other means to propo&s;e to her than the &s;ame operation; but particular rea&s;ons hin|dered the &s;ubmitting to it.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of the patient: the open|ing of the body.</NOTE>The patient died in 1740; I was ap|prized of the day of her death; I commu|nicated it to the academy of &s;urgery. The academy named M. Verdier and Foubert to make their report. M. Verdier, on whom I deferred the honour of opening the body, carried home with him all the parts, in order to make a particular di&s;&s;ec|tion of them in pre&s;ence of M. Foubert, my&s;elf, and &s;ome other curious per&s;ons, who went along with us to the defunct's. M. Verdier made &s;everal appointments, but kept none of them, through an affec|tation but little decent. What were his rea&s;ons to behave in this manner, and to have made no report to the academy, are things quite unknown to me.</P>

M. Boudou, head-&s;urgeon of that ho&s;pital, opened the body of this religious. The exterior parts con|&s;i&s;ted in a chink of no great depth, ruddy within, like the part of a woman; the two edges of that chink repre&s;ented, im|perfectly enough, the two lips of the vulva. In one of the&s;e two lips there was a te&s;ti|cle, in the other none: from the &s;pace be|tween the&s;e two lips i&s;&s;ued forth, towards the &s;uperior part, a &s;ort of penis ill-formed, unperforated. The urine had been al|ways determined through an orifice &s;itua|ted under the penis, at its root, in the part where is the meatus urinarius of wo|men. The&s;e was no appearance of a va|gina externally. After this examen, he opened the belly; he found that the &s;per|matick ve&s;&s;els ob&s;erved nearly the &s;ame direction as in the natural &s;tate; &s;uch of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, as were of the &s;ide of the te&s;ticle, went to empty them&s;elves into that organ; in&s;tead of the bladder of that &s;ide, in the ordinary &s;ituation, there was a &s;e|minal

<P>This religious had an ulcer in one of his legs, from whence periodically flowed, every month, a &s;anious &s;ero&s;ity, which made Mr. Boudou conjecture, that the di&s;charge, which was made by that ulcer, &s;upplied the place of the men&s;es.</P>

Dr. Dougla&s;s di&s;abu&s;ed the publick, by the de&s;cription he gave of the natural parts of a female African, who ten years ago pa&s;&s;ed in Londom for an her|maphrodite: he cau&s;ed to engrave the plate, which Mr. Che&s;elden has publi&s;hed in his anatomy, and Dr. Par&s;ons in his cri|tical inquiry into hermaphrodites. This
<PB N="49" REF="48">African had all the proportions of body, the tone of voice, and the ways of a woman. Two peculiarities only in her parts of gene|ration, were &s;ufficient to impo&s;e on the &s;im|ple, namely, the clitoris and the lips of the vulva. The clitoris, as may be &s;een plate IV. which I cau&s;ed to engrave after the original, is indeed larger and longer than in the natural &s;tate, but has nothing to characteri&s;e the penis; the right lip, exce&s;&s;ively large, compared with the other, is, with probability, &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. Dou|gla&s;s to include a hernia of the ovaries (it might al&s;o be an epiplocele) which impo|&s;ed on tho&s;e who con&s;idered it as a te&s;ticle. The marking down the urethra, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be between the nymphae, has e&s;caped the accuracy of Dr. Dougla&s;s. Dr. Par&s;ons's work contains &s;everal in&s;tances of this &s;ort, which he has drawn from authors; they all tend to his de&s;ign, name|ly, the proving the opinion he is in, that there is no hermaphrodite among men; <HI>that no hermaphrodital nature can exi&s;t in human bodies.</HI></P>

The Penis was unperforated both at the glans and preputium; he made water by an orifice greatly dilated, like a &s;ort of vulva, &s;ituated immediately under the &s;crotum. As to the re&s;t, the penis was, &s;ays M. Faudacque, disfigured and mon&s;trous, re|&s;embled a &s;mall &s;nail, was &s;o curled and bent, that the extremity of the glans, co|vered with the preputium, touched the po&s;terior part of the root of the penis. All the part, which an&s;wered to the place where naturally is the canal of the ure|thra, appeared to be ligamentous, and &s;o &s;hort, as to bridle in and bend the penis in the manner I have de&s;cribed.

<PB N="51" REF="50">down into the &s;crotum, but &s;ince he has ob&s;erved them there.</P>
<P>Mr. Mertru, &s;urgeon at Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IXth ob|&s;ervation ano|ther boy, taken for an her|maphrodite.</NOTE> has pub|li&s;hed in the <HI>Mercure de France</HI> for the month of February of this year 1750, the de&s;cription of the parts of the body of one named Michel-Anne Drouart, aged about &s;ixteen, born at Paris, in the Fauxbourg St. Marceau. The &s;tate of this young man, to whom M. Mertru a&s;cribes the character of hermaphrodite, leaves no doubt of the &s;pecies of his &s;ex, &s;ince he is in London, where he arrived four or five months ago. The difficulty of finding the cau&s;e of the &s;udden change of his &s;tate, will ju&s;tify my &s;ilence. His coun|tenance, his voice, his corpulence, the pro|portion of his limbs, denote very di&s;tinctly the male kind. He is a lad, who, for his age, is well built, but ill-formed in the parts of generation of a man, which are the only ones he has. Nature, indeed, &s;eems to have forgot her&s;elf in the con|formation of the penis; for tho' of the natural bulk, &s;ize, and figure, yet it is unperforated and bent downwards, being
<PB N="52" REF="51">forced to take that turn by a fold of the &s;kin, which extends from its root to the frenum: but as nature rarely lo&s;es on one hand, but &s;he gains on the other, &s;he has formed for her&s;elf a way at the root of the penis for the di&s;charge of the urine and other excretions. We may compare this aperture to the meatus urinarius in women: if there is any difference, it is only in the exterior figure of this orifice, in that it forms a &s;ort of excre&s;cence, compo&s;ed of a &s;imple fold of the &s;kin, which is of a &s;e|milunar figure; this fold forms a cavity about three lines in depth, and admits the extremity of the little finger to lodge in it; it terminates almo&s;t at all the circumfer|ence of the meatus urinarius, and has the figure of a funnel. On removing the two &s;ides of this excre&s;cence, we ob&s;erve in the inferior part a very delicate folding, but in which we found nothing to characterize the <HI>fourchette;</HI> this part forms, in young women e&s;pecially, who have had no chil|dren, a perfect cre&s;cent, and rai&s;ed much, which does not appear in this &s;ubject. At the bottom of the &s;ort of funnel I menti|oned, I find a &s;mall nipple (as Mr. Mertru
<PB N="53" REF="52">remarks) but to us it appeared to be ano|ther vice of conformation: it is placed over-again&s;t the urethra, and makes the jet of urine forked. The ab&s;ence of the te&s;ti|cles, in the two divided portions of the &s;crotum, holds &s;till to this day; but their exi&s;tence is for that not the le&s;s certain, &s;ince the &s;ubject has evacuations of &s;emi|nal matter, of the &s;ame con&s;i&s;tence and colour with that of a man of his age, in con&s;equence of the erections, which, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, procure him the enjoy|ment of the &s;ex. The want of te&s;ticles in the &s;crotum, is a defect common to a good many men, which hinders not their hav|ing a great deal of vigour; on the con|trary, they are much more able for gene|ration, on account of the heat in which the&s;e organs are kept<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This manner of &s;peaking, though improper, cea&s;es not to be under&s;tood.</NOTE>. <HI>I have on this &s;ubject a memoir both u&s;eful and intere&s;ting, which I purpo&s;e to publi&s;h &s;oon.</HI> As to the men&s;es, they have not hitherto appeared, and no|thing can make me believe they ever can.</P>
<P>We reckon then by this report, that the &s;ubject in que&s;tion, is a lad ill-formed

<P>In figure and body, in gro&s;s, it re&s;emb|led a girl: it was baptized by the name Margaret. The con&s;truction of the natu|ral parts was &s;uch, that no vagina appear|ed; there were, however, two lips, which characteri&s;ed only the part of the woman. From between the&s;e lips there i&s;&s;ued forth a pretty long penis, about eight inches in length, when in a &s;tate of erection; it was well formed, but without any preputium. There was, be&s;ides, no appearance of te&s;ti|cles; the urine and &s;emen i&s;&s;ued out as in a man, through the canal of the urethra but what was more extraordinary, the men&s;es pa&s;&s;ed regularly every month thro' the &s;ame canal.</P>

<PB N="55" REF="54">be ranked under the &s;pecies of perfect her|maphrodites: but as the per&s;on, who is the &s;ubject thereof, never had any chil|dren, and as there is no proof it ever begot any, this might be made a handle of to charge us with being inclined to decide too lightly. The readers therefore will be left at liberty to give to this &s;ubject what character they &s;hall judge to &s;uit be&s;t to it.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation is owing to M. Gallay, &s;urgeon of Gargenville near Mantes in Nor|mandy, who has &s;ubmitted it to the judg|ment of the academy of &s;urgery of Paris.</P>
<P>On the 27th of March 1740, being, &s;ays he, at the village of I&s;&s;ou near Mantes, I learned they were to bury, that very day, a woman who had pa&s;&s;ed for an herma|phrodite; I arrived at the moment they were about to convey the body into the earth. I begged of the hu&s;band to allow me to examine her, which he granted, on condition I &s;hould not open her. The na|tural parts appeared to me to con&s;i&s;t of the lips, the nymphae, &amp;c. At the &s;uperior angle of the great chink, where the clitoris
<PB N="56" REF="55">&s;hould be, there was a well-conditioned penis, the glans was proportional, and co|vered in part with its preputium, was as perfectly crowned as that of a man; at the extremity of this glans, there was an ori|fice, into which I introduced a probe, which entered quite into the bladder, from which i&s;&s;ued out the little urine it con|tained. This penis was three inches &s;ix lines in length, and three inches four lines in circumference. The urine had no other outlet than by this canal. I di&s;covered no te&s;ticles, the great lips were the parts which &s;hould naturally contain them; the vagina was placed, as u&s;ual, at the infe|rior part of the vulva; thither I introduced my fingers; with their extremities I felt the orifice of the matrix, who&s;e edges were hard, and, as it were, cartilaginous. The hu&s;band withdrew for a moment; I im|proved this time of ab&s;ence in opening the belly, in hopes of finding there the te&s;ti|cles; my expectation proved vain, I found nothing that had any relation to the&s;e parts; the ovaries, the tubae fallopianae, the womb, were &s;cirrhous. The return of the hu&s;band prevented the carrying any farther my curio&s;ity. There is room to
<PB N="57" REF="56">believe, that the penis con&s;i&s;ted of all the parts nece&s;&s;ary to its actions, &s;ince the hu&s;band a&s;&s;ured me, that it was of|ten in a &s;tate of erection. I could not learn, whether in that &s;tate it had ever di&s;charged any &s;ort of &s;eminal matter. As to the re&s;t, this woman had had her cour&s;es in her youth, never had had any children; her face was thick &s;et with a beard, the tone of her voice was manni&s;h.</P>
