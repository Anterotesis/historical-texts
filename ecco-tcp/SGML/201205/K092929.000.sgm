<P>THE object of the following &s;heets is to explain to your Maje&s;ty the nature of your late ill|ne&s;s. I have been anxious in my in|quiries concerning its origin and pro|gre&s;s. All di&s;ea&s;es of a &s;imilar nature admit of a &s;peedy cure, when properly treated.

<PB REF="3">
<P>THE thoughts which are in&s;erted in the following &s;heets may perhaps be of &s;ome utility to your Maje&s;ty. And my intentions will be quite ac|compli&s;hed, if they contribute, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, to the re&s;toration of your health, and to the prevention of relap&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE pathology and practice of medi|cine are (of all the arts and &s;ciences) the lea&s;t which approach to certainty and to truth; and the practitioners of phy&s;ic are therefore too often di&s;po&s;ed to appeal to conjecture, analogy, and probability, in their judgment and treatment of mo&s;t di&s;|ea&s;es, rather than to rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy, and a &s;cientific di&s;cernment of cau&s;es and effects.</P>
<P>EVEN from the infancy of this art, we find rea&s;oning from fal&s;e principles pre|vail,
<PB N="iv" REF="5">in&s;tead of ob&s;erving, with accuracy, the uniform cour&s;e of nature. The &s;ymp|toms of di&s;ea&s;es are, therefore, more care|fully noticed than their cau&s;es; and the practice of phy&s;ic is, con&s;equently, more influenced by <HI>effects</HI> than by <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> which &s;hould be the &s;olid ba&s;is upon which all rea&s;oning concerning di&s;ea&s;es ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE innovation which was introduced in the practice of phy&s;ic by the celebrated Dr. Sydenham, was of e&s;&s;ential importance, &s;o far as it was calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h a pro|per and rational method of practice in all di&s;ea&s;es of a phlogi&s;tic or inflammatory nature; &s;uch as the pleuri&s;y, &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, and di&s;ea&s;es of this de&s;cription.
<PB N="v" REF="6">But it is very evident, that in tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite nature, &s;uch as nervous fevers, pal&s;ies, apoplexies, epilep&s;ies, and all di&s;|ea&s;es of this nature, it mu&s;t produce a different effect: and this is completely proved, by its bringing on, in the&s;e modi|fications of di&s;ea&s;e, the very wor&s;t of con&s;e|quences, and even death.</P>
<P>THE principles and practice of this di&s;|tingui&s;hed phy&s;ician have therefore had a bad effect, &s;o far as they have been the means of introducing a dangerous practice in nine tenths of the di&s;ea&s;es of mankind. For they have found their way into all the principal &s;chools of phy&s;ic in Europe, and prevail, to a great extent in the practice of medicine, all over the world at this pre&s;ent time.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
<P>ALL nervous di&s;ea&s;es, and fevers in par|ticular, ari&s;e more frequently from dome&s;tic anxieties, and pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, &s;uch as grief, di&s;appointment, and de&s;pair, than from any other cau&s;es what&s;oever. And in order to remove them, it is evident, that to increa&s;e the cau&s;e is not the method to remove the di&s;ea&s;e. But the idea that ple|thora, or too great a quantity of blood ex|i&s;ts in the body, and is therefore the cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, is a mo&s;t pernicious doc|trine; con&s;equently bleeding, cupping, a &s;pare diet, purging, and applications of this nature, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be efficacious in re|moving of the&s;e &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es; and more e&s;pecially when they affect athletic and ro|bu&s;t people. This &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e, there|fore,
<PB N="vii" REF="8">points out to a mo&s;t dangerous method of cure.</P>
<P>IT has been the &s;tudy of a great part of my life to inquire into the defects which prevail &s;o univer&s;ally in the practice of phy&s;ic; and I hope that the ob&s;ervations I have made, and the improvements I have in future to &s;ugge&s;t, may be of &s;ome uti|lity. The bulk of mankind are aver&s;e to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, from the tech|nical terms, the endle&s;s multiplication of cau&s;es, and the numerous uncouth names for di&s;ea&s;es and their remedies, which pre|vail &s;o univer&s;ally; therefore private gen|tlemen were never remarkable for their knowledge of this art, although they have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves often by their deep
<PB N="viii" REF="9">inquiries into law, antiquities, &amp;c. A Sel|den and a Spelman were private gentle|men; and no men have been more keen in their re&s;earches concerning points of law and con&s;titutional topics.</P>
<P>IT is therefore much to be lamented, that men of fortune, rank, and learning, do not bend their minds to inquiries into &s;ubjects of &s;o much importance to mankind as the healing art. The healing art is &s;urely the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to our natures of any what&s;oever; and yet men of di&s;|tinction and con&s;equence in general treat it as a department of knowledge beneath their notice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is an exception to this remark in an illu&s;trious foreigner, His Serene Highne&s;s the Prince and Duke de Bouil|lon, who is not only a profound philo&s;opher, but a mo&s;t di&s;|cerning phy&s;ician.</NOTE>. The practice of phy&s;ic in
<PB N="ix" REF="10">Great Britain is, at this pre&s;ent time, to be con&s;idered as the re&s;ult of applying Dr. Boerhaave's and Dr. Cullen's principles to practice. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems have been mo&s;t compleatly exploded, both as fal&s;e in their principles, and mo&s;t pernicious in their practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Brown's works, and an Inquiry into the State of Medicine, upon the principles of inductive philo&s;ophy.</NOTE>. And yet the advocates for the&s;e &s;y&s;tems of medicine are &s;uffered to domi|neer, as it were, over the &s;ufferings of mankind.</P>
<P>THE method of treating of nervous fe|vers, of every de&s;cription, is in a lamentable condition indeed. We hear of tho&s;e that &s;urvive; and the new&s;papers inform us of &s;ome that are dead. We cea&s;e to inquire into cau&s;es, and we &s;it down contented
<PB N="x" REF="11">with viewing of effects. It is, I am for|ward to &s;ay, owing to the mi&s;management of the fair &s;ex after laying in, that we hear of the death of &s;o many. It is very likely that they may experience a little fever at this time; but ignorance and mi&s;manage|ment <HI>at this period</HI> is likely to convert it into a nervous, or putrid fever, and death. All mankind experience a pre-di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;es, before they announce them|&s;elves with all their formality and terrors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The doctrine of <HI>pre-di&s;po&s;ition</HI> to di&s;ea&s;e is perhaps the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful department of phy&s;ic. Every man feels the approach of di&s;ea&s;e before it comes on, by a variety of different &s;ymptoms, which are peculiar to every de|&s;cription of men. The Gout is known before it makes its ap|pearance, to tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to it, by flatulent complaints in the &s;tomach and bowels, accompanied with acid eructations, and apprehen&s;ions and fear of the di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ame is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e with fevers, and with great numbers of nervous complaints. This is the time that a phy&s;ician has it in his power to exert his &s;kill and judgment, and before the di&s;ea&s;e makes its formal appearance; therefore a proper know|ledge of the doctrine of pre-di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;es, as it is called, is of the greate&s;t utility in preventing the acce&s;&s;ion of them. Therefore Dr. Willis, with all deference to this phy&s;ician, was perfectly erroneous in a&s;&s;erting, that di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame nature with that complaint under which his Maje&s;ty has laboured are liable to relap&s;es; for the knowledge of a &s;tate of pre-di&s;po|&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;e will qualify a di&s;cerning phy&s;ician to ob&s;erve the malady at a di&s;tance, and to prevent the tumult which it cre|ates&mdash;relap&s;es, in the&s;e ca&s;es, are therefore accounted for. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty will be an invalid for &s;ome time to come, and that he will be liable to trifling attacks of his di&s;ea&s;e. During this period, it would be very advi&s;able that there &s;hould be a phy&s;ician in con&s;tant attendance, who ought to have nothing el&s;e to do but to wait on his royal patient, and to obviate every little attack, by proper medicines, diet, &amp;c. This plan will con&s;tantly en&s;ure his Maje&s;ty a good &s;tate of health, and enable him, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, to be, from experience alone, his own phy&s;ician.</NOTE>.
<PB N="xi" REF="12">When the di&s;ea&s;e takes place, we are not in a condition to help our&s;elves, and we therefore are obliged to &s;end for the advice of tho&s;e who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be qualified to
<PB N="xii" REF="13">under&s;tand it. The patient, at this time, is perhaps re&s;tle&s;s
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the reports of his Maje&s;ty's phy&s;icians of the 7th, 8th, and 9th of December, I am &s;till more &s;trengthened in my opinion, that his di&s;ea&s;e is neither more nor le&s;s than a nervous fever. Every man, in all de&s;criptions of nervous fevers, is rather incoherent, unle&s;s they are refre&s;hed by &s;leep. For a want of re&s;t debilitates the mind and body to a great degree. This is proved by the invigorating effects of &s;leep which his Maje&s;ty experienced on the 8th and 9th.

, with a &s;evere and heavy feeling in the head, cold chills, with great la&s;&s;itude, and full of melancholy apprehen|&s;ions. Or he may labour under a delirium, and raging fever. An error at this time is irretrievable; and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of great judgment, and a nice di&s;cernment of cau&s;es, in the phy&s;ician. Bleeding, bli&s;ter|ing, vomiting, and purging, will at this
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">time encrea&s;e the malady, and, eventually, bring on death. The delirium ari&s;es from a weakened condition of the nervous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem in general, but more e&s;pe|cially in the brain. Sudorifics and opiates produce a temporary relief; and it behoves tho&s;e who admini&s;ter the&s;e medicines, to take particular care that the patient is not expo&s;ed to the &s;malle&s;t degree of cold during their operation, or the delirium will be encrea&s;ed, and all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e aggravated to an alarming degree.</P>
<P>I HAVE had the management of a great number of patients labouring under ner|vous or putrid fevers, and have uniformly been &s;ucce&s;sful in the treatment of this
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">dangerous di&s;ea&s;e. But I have ob&s;erved, and I have abundance of proofs to e&s;tabli&s;h my ob&s;ervation, that it &s;ometimes happens, that what is called a &s;tate of in&s;anity, is the con&s;equence of the&s;e fevers.</P>
<P>A CONTINUAL &s;tate of delirium will either bring on death, or a con&s;iderable re|laxation in the blood ve&s;&s;els of the brain, which will <HI>&s;ine vi a tergo,</HI> admit of more blood within them, than they were, in their vigorous and healthy &s;tate, capable of receiving; ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner that &s;evere &s;tudy, hard drinking, &s;evere vomit|ing, and the application of leeches to eyes which are inflamed through weakne&s;s, will produce a greater degree of inflammation
<PB N="xv" REF="16">in them, by weakening &s;till more the&s;e parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are no di&s;ea&s;es more ob&s;tinate in their cure than &s;ome inflammatory conditions of the eyes. A great number of people lo&s;e their &s;ight by tampering with their eyes in this &s;itu|ation. The great object of &s;urgery is to prevent the amputa|tion of legs and arms, by curing of the di&s;ea&s;e, which, how|ever, in &s;ome ca&s;es, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. But &s;urgeons, as well as oculi&s;ts, are too fond of u&s;ing of in&s;truments. Ocu|li&s;ts are not in general &s;ufficiently qualified to rea&s;on concerning the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes, much le&s;s of ob&s;tinate opthal|mias, or inflammations affecting the&s;e organs; hence ari&s;es the inveteracy of this di&s;ea&s;e. It is therefore probable, that a noble Lord, once high in office, will lo&s;e the u&s;e of his eyes from mi&s;|management. For the method of treating the&s;e inflammations of the eyes, is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the indication of cure. They are, from the inflammatory appearance of the blood ve&s;|&s;els, conceived to be real inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, when the con|trary, I am ready and willing to prove, is the fact, in nineteen times out of twenty. I have had the management of a great number of patients labouring under this ob&s;tinate complaint, and have been &s;ucce&s;sful in curing every individual that has been under my care.
<P>My motive in introducing of this &s;ubject is only to &s;hew, that in ca&s;es of mental derangement, the blood ve&s;&s;els within the brain are in the preci&s;e &s;ituation of debility and re|laxation which takes place in the blood ve&s;&s;els which occupy the anterior parts of the eyes in ob&s;tinate <HI>Opthalmias;</HI> and that to invigorate, by all po&s;&s;ible means, the whole &s;y&s;tem, and the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem in particular of the parts affected, is the only cure.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">
<P>THERE is no affliction more painful to man than the gout; and yet important di&s;|coveries have been made of late, in order to &s;hew that it admits of a &s;peedy cure and ea&s;y management. And I am well con|vinced, from my own experience, that the fear and apprehen&s;ions of what takes place in fits of this di&s;ea&s;e, often produces what is called a relap&s;e. The apprehen&s;ion of the pa&s;t feelings, and pains, generally brings on a renewal of the di&s;ea&s;e. And phy&s;icians ought to be particularly care|ful to prevent their patients from going
<PB N="xvii" REF="18">out into the cold in a &s;tate of convale&s;|cence. Cold applied to the body in this &s;tate, and e&s;pecially at this time of the year, will generally produce a relap&s;e; and I &s;u&s;pect that his Maje&s;ty has experienced, from this cau&s;e alone, di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences, and that very lately. In a &s;tate of convale&s;cence, the mind is always me|lancholy and dejected; and whatever weak|ens the body at this time, will, to a cer|tainty, bring on a return of the di&s;ea&s;e. Exce&s;&s;ive heat in &s;ultry weather produces nearly the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>IN this treati&s;e I have endeavoured to be as &s;hort and as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. But in a future publication, which I have in contemplation, I intend to offer my opi|nions

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a di&s;ea&s;e which a&s;&s;umes a greater variety of appearances, nor has given occa&s;ion to the loquacity and de|cided opinions of practitioners of Medicine, than the complaint which has for &s;ome time pa&s;t afflicted our mo&s;t amiable Sove|reign. At one time it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Gout, at other times the Hypochon|dria&s;is, and at others a Nervous Fever: nay, it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by almo&s;t every name which is congenial to the medical dogmas of practitioners of phy&s;ic.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="21">
<P>IT unfortunately happens to mankind, that the method of living which Phy&s;i|cians in general ob&s;erve, is likely to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a good &s;tate of health; and hence ari&s;es their implicit faith in books and &s;y&s;|timatical writers. They are therefore &s;el|dom harra&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e complaints, which &s;o con&s;tantly fall to the lot of &s;ocial, and convivial &s;pirits, which are commonly Fevers, the Rheumati&s;m, flatulent Com|plaints, &s;evere nervous Feelings in the Head, and over every part of the body, and the Gout. But while habits of con|viviality produce the&s;e effects, the oppo&s;ite extreme, &s;uch as ab&s;tinence in wine and animal food, and &s;o forth, are attended with preci&s;ely the &s;ame con&s;equences, and this &s;tate is completely demon&s;trated in the pre|&s;ent deranged condition of his Maje&s;ty's health.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="22">
<P>I HAVE long been an enemy to Dr. Cullen's practice in general<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Note A.</NOTE>; for I have &s;een it &s;o often attended with the mo&s;t fa|tal con&s;equences, and more e&s;pecially in Fevers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to an Inquiry into the State of Medicine.</NOTE>. The natural termination of Fe|vers is in a &s;tate of delirium, and, ulti|mately, in death, if a deranged condition of the intellectual powers do not intervene to prevent the di&s;&s;olution of nature. This &s;tate is called by the name of Madne&s;s: and if human invention was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to operate this effect, the method now in u&s;e among practitioners of medi|cine is compleatly equal to produce it.</P>
<P>LET me a&s;k this que&s;tion, What is it that produces the di&s;ea&s;e known by the name of a nervous, or putrid Fever? Every phy&s;ician, who has a grain of common &s;en&s;e, will an&s;wer, that it is produced by
<PB N="4" REF="23">debilitating cau&s;es! But in order to re|fine upon the&s;e cau&s;es, and to &s;pin a web of their own creation, they will in&s;i&s;t upon the addition of contagion, effluvia from putrid &s;ub&s;tances, exhalations from mar&s;hy grounds, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE penetrating Rou&s;&s;eau wi&s;ely &s;ays, that "&s;cience which in&s;tructs, and me|dicine which cures, are both undoubt|edly very good; but &s;cience which deceives, and medicine which kills, are bad. Teach us how to di&s;criminate them&mdash;there lies the difficulty of the que&s;tion."</P>
<P>THERE never was an art more full of de|ception than the practice of phy&s;ic: and this is completely illu&s;trated, by the fatal termination of mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es which are inflicted by Providence upon mankind. We are, in general, di&s;po&s;ed to refer the cau&s;es of fevers, and other di&s;ea&s;es, to the
<PB N="5" REF="24">influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es alone, and to overlook the operation of moral cau&s;es al|together; whereas it can be proved, that moral cau&s;es are chiefly the forerunners of mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es depending upon debility; and in this &s;tate of the body, the application of phy&s;ical cau&s;es, &s;uch as cold applied to it, in a debilitated &s;tate, heat, contagion, pu|trid effluvia, and other powers, operating upon &s;imilar principles, will more effec|tually produce di&s;ea&s;es of this nature; and the effect of the&s;e powers will be the more compleat, if to the&s;e are added exce&s;s of every kind, immoderate indulgence in the pa&s;&s;ions, fatigues of the mind, together with the afflictions and pains which are felt in every condition of mortality, from the monarch to the beggar, and which harrow up, and con&s;tantly prey upon our minds.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="25">
<P>A MONARCH is perhaps the mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed to the&s;e cau&s;es.

<P>I HAVE often been a&s;toni&s;hed to hear, that his Maje&s;ty could &s;u&s;tain, (without being precipitated long before this time into a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e,) the weighty, and im|portant bu&s;ine&s;s, which, like a mill&s;tone, mu&s;t have hung heavy upon his mind, at the &s;ame time that it was reported, that he eat chiefly of vegetable food, and drank nothing but wine and water. To carry on a train of thought with vigour and effect, or to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence, which is often very di&s;agreeable to the mind, requires the adventitious aid of &s;ti|mulating food, and cordial liquors, or the di&s;ea&s;es I have taken notice of above will eventually take place. And phy&s;icians, as well as their patients, will be woefully deceived, if they &s;uppo&s;e that either the Cheltenham waters, or the Bath waters, or even tho&s;e of Spa, will operate wonders,
<PB N="9" REF="28">when the enemy, I mean di&s;ea&s;e, has &s;tormed the citadel.</P>
<P>DISEASES, in the commencement of their attacks upon the con&s;titution, are but faint re&s;emblances of what are to happen. But they enliven our &s;en&s;ibilities, and our apprehen&s;ions, in proportion to their pro|gre&s;s; and our memories are at this time eternally pre&s;enting to us &s;cenes in which we have acted a part. Hence philo&s;ophers, as well as morali&s;ts, are con&s;tantly declaim|ing again&s;t tho&s;e gloomy ideas which hurt their &s;olitary hours, and damp their mo&s;t a&s;piring thoughts, by exhibiting things in the mo&s;t odious colours imaginable.</P>
<P>THE cares and anxieties of private indi|viduals, as well as of tho&s;e who are placed in more elevated capacities, in&s;en&s;ibly bring on di&s;ea&s;es, and tho&s;e of a peculiar nature.
<PB N="10" REF="29">And there are &s;ometimes &s;nares, which even wi&s;dom and prudence will not prevent our falling into. Although a warrior is often liable to them, a &s;tate&s;man is infinitely more &s;o, which the hi&s;tory of mankind completely proves. Dome&s;tic anxieties, popular tumults, and national di&s;a&s;ters, mu&s;t con&s;tantly aggravate his feelings; and the&s;e marks of &s;en&s;ibility will, &s;ooner or later, produce nervous di&s;ea&s;es. The con|dition of &s;tate&s;men in general is by no means applicable to the &s;ituation of the fir&s;t ma|gi&s;trate of his dominions, who has the per|petual call of his people to the exerci&s;e of every thing that is wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and benevo|lent. And when wi&s;dom, virtue, benevo|lence, and prudence, are di&s;appointed in their intentions, maladies of a mo&s;t forbid|ding a&s;pect too often take place. Therefore the only con&s;olation we can enjoy when we are afflicted with di&s;ea&s;e, is to &s;ubmit with
<PB N="11" REF="30">patience and philo&s;ophy to the fate of men, and to the decrees of fate. Nay, if a &s;traight wai&s;tcoat is advi&s;ed by a grave phy&s;ician, as a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to our mi&s;ery, we mu&s;t even &s;ubmit to this mo&s;t infernal, and brutal u&s;age. And this act of brutality, I am both free, and bold enough to acknowledge, is the con&s;equence of employing of tho&s;e, who are profoundly ignorant of the principles, and philo&s;ophy of the healing art. I have &s;aid before, that what is commonly termed madne&s;s, is brought on by the improper treatment of fevers: for this di&s;ea&s;e is no more here|ditary than the Gout, or the &s;crofula, which I have &s;hewn, in my treati&s;e upon the Gout, to be a di&s;ea&s;e depending upon the common cau&s;es of a relaxed habit. But I need not appeal to a greater authority, than my late learned preceptor, and worthy friend, Dr. Brown, who has had the honour to
<PB N="12" REF="31">explain, with the forcible language of truth, the nature of this di&s;ea&s;e, as well as almo&s;t every other incident to man.</P>
<P>THIS idea leads me to a digre&s;&s;ion which I did not intend to make. But as I con|ceive it to be of &s;ome importance to man|kind, I intend to offer my opinions, at &s;ome length, upon the &s;ubject, as they may be of utility to mankind. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider the &s;ubject, both as a philo&s;opher, as well as a phy&s;ician; and I hope that a di&s;cerning public will not im|pute blame to an intention, which has the benefit of my fellow creatures before me.</P>
<P>WHEN I vi&s;ited the <HI>Bi&s;&s;etre</HI> at Paris, in the year 1785, I could not forbear exhi|biting my &s;en&s;ibilities, and my feelings, at &s;eeing &s;uch a number of unfortunate per|&s;ons
<PB N="13" REF="32">chained down to their &s;olitary abodes, without any other cau&s;e, from what I could learn, than the peculiarity of their conduct, or excentricity of their behaviour. In the cour&s;e of my walk, and ob&s;ervations, I came to the cell of an Engli&s;hman, who had been a captain of a trading ve&s;&s;el from Dover, and who had been captured by a French priva|teer in the war before la&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;aid that he had been 30 years in con&s;inement at the <HI>Bi&s;&s;etre.</HI></NOTE>. I had two Engli&s;h ladies, a French lady, and a French gentleman in my company; and as &s;oon as he found that there were Engli&s;h in com|pany, he &s;poke his mind very freely to us, and told us his &s;tory with the mo&s;t perfect di&s;tinctne&s;s. His mind was perfectly col|lected, and he was much di&s;po&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s the fervency of it during the time we were in conver&s;ation with him; but the police of the place rendered it nece&s;&s;ary that
<PB N="14" REF="33">we &s;hould &s;aunter on to another abode of mi&s;ery, and quit the man&s;ion of this &s;on of misfortune. The plea&s;ures of commu|nicating his &s;orrowful tale to his country|women and my&s;elf being thus abruptly in|terrupted, mu&s;t unque&s;tionably have af|fected the feelings of the de&s;pairing man; and we could hear him, upon our depar|ture, break out into all the wild language of fury and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>THIS, as well as many other ca&s;es which I could place before my reader, during my &s;tay at this place, is a proof that moral cau&s;es have as great, if not a greater influence, in creating and perpetuating of nervous di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds, than phy&s;ical cau&s;es; and of that di&s;ea&s;e, called <HI>mania,</HI> in parti|cular.</P>
<P>THIS leads me, in a natural direction, to con&s;ider the character and important
<PB N="15" REF="34">tru&s;t generally repo&s;ed by their patients, and the friends and relations of their pa|tients, in practitioners of phy&s;ic. I have endeavoured to &s;hew, in my Inquiry into the State of Medicine, that the education of phy&s;icians in general has a tendency to lead them to engage in di&s;putes of words, while they imagine that they are handling controver&s;ies of the deepe&s;t importance and concern. It was in order to avoid alter|cations &s;o frivolous and endle&s;s, that the penetrating and learned Dr. John Brown endeavoured to &s;tate, with the utmo&s;t cau|tion and &s;implicity, the great <HI>de&s;iderata</HI> of medicine, and to frame a plan of his own, for the removal of all the ob&s;tacles to the improvement of this noble art. This il|lu&s;trious man &s;aw, almo&s;t intuitively, the cobwebs which hung in &s;u&s;pence the fate of mankind: and if he had not united philo&s;ophy, and profound learning, to|gether
<PB N="16" REF="35">with much experience, the healing art might langui&s;h in its pre&s;ent deplorable condition for ages to come.</P>

<P>To return, however, to my &s;ubject. Di&s;ea&s;es and death are the uniform fate of mortals. The infirmities of life, and the pains of di&s;ea&s;e, will naturally obtrude them&s;elves upon tho&s;e in exalted &s;ituations, as well as upon the mo&s;t humble of beings; and in this condition of things it is, that re|flection takes place. In the gay and plea|&s;ing moments of fe&s;tivity and health, the fleeting moments of mirth and di&s;&s;ipation eraze all thoughts from our minds which are di&s;agreeable to us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Note D.</NOTE>; and hence amu&s;e|ments of all &s;orts are &s;ought after by the more wealthy, to &s;tifle tho&s;e &s;entiments of

<P>THERE are no di&s;ea&s;es which a&s;&s;ume a greater variety of appearances than <HI>Agues, Fevers,</HI> and the <HI>Gout.</HI> When the gout flies to the head, it renders the feelings of the patient exqui&s;itely painful. When the ague vi&s;its the head, the feelings are preci&s;ely the &s;ame. Nay, in what phy&s;icians call <HI>nervous fevers,</HI> there is the &s;ame intermi&s;&s;ion of di&s;agreeable &s;ymptoms which prevails in the gout as well as in intermittent fevers. The patient is utterly at a lo&s;s to explain certain &s;ymptoms which take place in in|termittents, &s;uch as the &s;evere and dreadful feelings which rack his head, and put him
<PB N="19" REF="38">in momentary expectation of death. The &s;ame is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e in the gout. For the &s;ame appearances of the body, &s;uch as extreme languor, melancholy apprehen|&s;ions, a &s;tate of de&s;pair, more or le&s;s, tre|mors, a &s;u&s;ceptibility of what is commonly called catching cold, a propen&s;ity to think in a di&s;agreeable train of thought, and &s;e|veral other &s;ymptoms of the &s;ame nature, are ob&s;ervable in this di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o. Putrid, or what are termed nervous fevers, di&s;cover a great re&s;emblance in their progre&s;s and ter|mination to the&s;e foregoing di&s;ea&s;es, and are al&s;o to be relieved by a &s;imilar treatment.</P>
<P>BUT the numerous hypothe&s;is of phy&s;i|cians concerning the&s;e three di&s;tinct modi|fications of di&s;ea&s;es, form in&s;urmountable barriers to their being treated upon &s;imilar principles; and hence the diffu&s;ion of er|ror, and unaccountable torpor, which pre|vail
<PB N="20" REF="39">&s;o univer&s;ally among practitioners of phy&s;ic, in their treatment of them.</P>
<P>THERE is no end to the variety of books and di&s;&s;ertations upon medical &s;ubjects written by phy&s;icians. But the influence of the pa&s;&s;ions has been, in almo&s;t all the&s;e verbal di&s;putes and di&s;&s;ertations, too un|heededly pa&s;&s;ed over. <Q>"An evil, con|ceived as barely po&s;&s;ible, &s;ometimes pro|duces fear; e&s;pecially if the evil be very great.

<P>I HAVE often experienced the truth of this ob&s;ervation in my own per&s;on.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="40">
<P>THE regulation of the pa&s;&s;ions is, there|fore, in all nervous di&s;ea&s;es, a principal <HI>de&s;i|deratum:</HI> and the phy&s;ician who is not phi|lo&s;opher enough to know how and when to apply with &s;ucce&s;s his penetration in the regulation of the pa&s;&s;ions, will very &s;eldom relieve a nervous di&s;ea&s;e, or a di&s;ordered &s;tate of the intellect. What is the rea&s;on that there are &s;o many receptacles for what the ignorant world call mad people? I will an&s;wer very frankly, it is becau&s;e &s;o much ignorance and want of true philo&s;ophy prevail among the generality of phy&s;icians. It is an abominable di&s;grace to Britain, to behold &s;uch a number of public, as well as private mad-hou&s;es, as there are in this i&s;land. When an unfortunate man or wo|man have been mi&s;managed in a dreadful and alarming di&s;ea&s;e, it is propo&s;ed by &s;ome ignorant or intere&s;ted daemon or other, to &s;end the mi&s;erable object of pity and
<PB N="22" REF="41">compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ome place of &s;ecurity, where he has nothing to con&s;ole him but cold, hunger, and ill u&s;age. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak too much at large concerning the di&s;ea&s;es brought upon mankind by the all-powerful operation of the pa&s;&s;ion of fear, in its different modifications. Both Mr. Hume, and Rou&s;&s;eau, &s;peak of this pa&s;&s;ion, as to its cau&s;es and effects; and they &s;eem to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure right, &s;o far as it produces di&s;ea&s;es of the nervous kind, and what are vulgarly called maniacal di&s;ea&s;es among the re&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>"A DIBILITATED body," &s;ays Rou&s;|&s;eau, "weakens the &s;oul. On this is founded the empire of medicine; an art more pernicious to man than all the ills it pretends to cure. For my own part, I know not of what di&s;orders phy&s;icians cure us; but I know this, that they give
<PB N="23" REF="42">&s;ome which are very fatal, &s;uch as cow|ardice, pu&s;illanimity, and the fear of death. If they cure our body, they kill courage.

<P>THIS ingenious philo&s;opher was in a great mea&s;ure right in his ob&s;ervations. For there is not a doubt, but that the method adopted by phy&s;icians in former ages, as well as in tho&s;e of our own times, is de|&s;tructive of that principle which upholds us in afflictions, as well as in di&s;ea&s;e, and that is courage. I do not at all wonder that dramatic writers, &s;uch as Moliere, and other authors of &s;agacity and penetration, were forward in decyphering the hypocri&s;y and artifice which predominate &s;o much among
<PB N="24" REF="43">&s;ome practitioners of medicine. It is quite enough to de&s;troy a man's courage, in a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, to &s;ee two, three, or more phy&s;icians, dre&s;&s;ed in black, with grave countenances, and every affected art which formality it&s;elf can invent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, Note E.</NOTE>.&mdash;To depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits and afflicted minds, &s;uch &s;ymbols of compa&s;&s;ion and relief hold out no allure|ments to plea&s;e and to gratify a di&s;tempered mind, which requires every &s;olacement which virtuous &s;en&s;ibility is ever ready to communicate to the unfortunate. The Scriptures &s;ay, <Q>"Ble&s;&s;ed is the peace|maker;"</Q> but how much more ble&s;&s;ed and happy mu&s;t that man be, who, by his pro|found knowledge in his profe&s;&s;ion, aided by that of deep philo&s;ophy, and a know|ledge of the pa&s;&s;ions, knows how to curb them, and when to rai&s;e them! he mu&s;t &s;urely afford the greate&s;t of comforts to the di&s;tracted mind, and dibilitated body.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="44">
<P>WHEN I left the univer&s;ity, I flattered my&s;elf with the belief, that all di&s;ea&s;es were to be cured by medicine and diet. And I have often expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e, that my attempts in &s;ome in&s;tances were ineffectual. But when the patient was dead, &s;ome un|fore&s;een circum&s;tance then made its appear|ance, which &s;ufficiently convinced me, that corroding cares had long preyed upon the mind, and that the heart had bled with re|peated &s;orrows; which has often &s;ince made me think, that phy&s;ic and phy&s;icians are but imperfect in&s;truments to re&s;tore to vi|gour, con&s;titutions worn out with cares and anxiety.</P>
<P>A POOR man, when reduced in intellec|tual and bodily vigour by ill u&s;age, and the &s;ophi&s;try and empirici&s;m which prevail in medicine, is &s;ent for the remainder of his days to Bedlam, or &s;ome other man&s;ion of
<PB N="26" REF="45">mi&s;ery. The rich man is confined to his own chambers, without one gleam of hope, either to invigorate his body, or comfort his mind. He is deprived of the &s;ociety of tho&s;e he loves and re&s;pects. The amu&s;ements which he had been accu&s;tomed to are never to refre&s;hen his wa&s;ted &s;pirits, or his decayed body; and in this &s;olitary and dreadful condition is he to expiate, if he has any, all his errors and his &s;ins. I would rather, if I had my choice, be car|ried about the country, as Bajazet the Em|peror of the Ottomans was, a &s;pectacle for fools, and wor&s;e than fools, to look at, than be a pri&s;oner in the predicament I have mentioned.</P>
<P>WERE I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the eloquence of Demo&s;thenes, Cicero, and Tully, I fear I &s;hould be unequal to utter my &s;entiments at full length upon this important topic;
<PB N="27" REF="46">becau&s;e I am well aware, that all di&s;ea&s;es, where the vigour of the mind is affected, are the re&s;ult of the pa&s;&s;ion of fear, which is a mo&s;t debilitating pa&s;&s;ion, and is the prin|cipal cau&s;e of almo&s;t all nervous di&s;ea&s;es. There is not a doubt but that it frequently produces convul&s;ive, as well as &s;pa&s;modic di&s;ea&s;es; and I have been a witne&s;s to its bringing on fits of the gout repeatedly. I have not a doubt in my own mind but that it brings on the hydrophobia, and melan|cholic di&s;ea&s;es, and what phy&s;icians term mania, or madne&s;s. And I am well con|vinced, that phy&s;ic, as it is generally prac|ti&s;ed, is the mo&s;t &s;uitable of all profe&s;&s;ions to produce this nervous di&s;ea&s;e. If a per&s;on, in a debilitated &s;tate of the body, is bled, bli&s;tered, vomited, and purged, he will, to a certainty, experience &s;ome &s;evere nervous di&s;ea&s;e. But if the&s;e dibilitating powers are added to the di&s;ea&s;e, it is natural
<PB N="28" REF="47">to &s;uppo&s;e, that death will be the con&s;e|quence, unle&s;s what phy&s;icians call in&s;a|nity takes place. <Q>"But even <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> evils," &s;ays Mr. Hume, "cau&s;e fear; as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice, though we know our&s;elves to be in a &s;tate of perfect &s;ecurity, and have it in our choice whether we will advance a &s;tep farther. The im|mediate pre&s;ence of the evil influences the imagination, and produces a &s;pecies of belief; but being oppo&s;ed by the re|flection on our &s;ecurity, the belief is im|mediately retracted, and cau&s;es <HI>the &s;ame kind</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion as when, from a contra|riety of chances, contrary pa&s;&s;ions are produced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's E&s;&s;ays.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions produce infinitely greater effects upon the mind when the body is
<PB N="29" REF="48">in a debilitated &s;tate, than when it enjoys a healthy and vigorous &s;tate, whether this condition of the body ari&s;es from a too &s;pare diet, or from a too voluptuous one. The imagination is infinitely more lively with apprehen&s;ion in relaxed habits, than in vigorous con&s;titutions. And hence ari|&s;es the great nece&s;&s;ity of caution, pre&s;ence of mind, and minute circum&s;pection in tho&s;e who are commi&s;&s;ioned to attend the &s;ick. For an error at this time is often ir|retrievable, but more e&s;pecially when gen|tlemen of the faculty attend patients in ex|alted &s;ituations. Their empirici&s;m, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;uming the bold and decided practice of Van Helmont, or Paracel&s;us, now puts on an air of timidity, for fear of what are termed <HI>the con&s;equences.</HI></P>
<P>To contribute, by want of fore&s;ight, or a profound and di&s;criminating knowledge
<PB N="30" REF="49">of di&s;ea&s;es, to the death of any department of &s;ociety, is generally a prelude to their want of bu&s;ine&s;s as phy&s;icians; and there|fore it is natural to pre&s;ume, that they will exerci&s;e more than common caution, and indulge in more than u&s;ual timi|dity, when they are to pre&s;cribe for their Sovereign. As fevers are the re&s;ult of de|bilitating powers, and con&s;i&s;t of debility over every part of the body, but more e&s;|pecially in the head, it is to be pre&s;umed, that the King's phy&s;icians ab&s;tained from bleeding, bli&s;tering, &amp;c. in their late treat|ment of him.</P>
<P>AN unu&s;ual fatality is generally the lot of kings, when they are &s;ubjected, by either accident or di&s;ea&s;e, to the fate pre&s;cribed by nature for man. In his healthy and vigorous &s;tate, both of body and mind, he is, as it were, elevated by the exce&s;&s;ive obei|&s;ance
<PB N="31" REF="50">of his courtiers, to a rank infinitely &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind.&mdash;But ob&s;erve the rever&s;e! When all-prying di&s;ea&s;e commits its havock upon his body, and his mind, then he is reduced to a level with the re&s;t of mankind, if not to a greater &s;tate of mortification, and even humilia|tion. That nature, in a great mea&s;ure, points to relief, is a rule of infinite impor|tance in the healing art, but never attended to as it ought, by tho&s;e who have the management of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>To regulate the mind in all di&s;ea&s;es, but more e&s;pecially in all nervous complaints, is an object of fundamental importance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bite of the <HI>Tarantula,</HI> they affirm, is to be cured by mu&s;ic; and I do not deny the po&s;&s;ibility of it in &s;ome ca&s;es. The bite of the rattle-&s;nake, by the &s;nake-root; the ague, by the Peruvian bark; the bite of a mad dog, by immer&s;ion in &s;ea-water, nearly approaching to drowning the patient; the &s;yphibilic di&s;ea&s;e, by mercury; &s;chirrous and cancerated parts, by preparations of hemlock, and &s;o forth, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> The efficacy of the&s;e medicines, and applications, in the&s;e particular di&s;ea&s;es, depend as much in the expectation of relief they afford, as in any &s;pecific virtues they are endowed with. I have not a doubt, but that the greate&s;t number of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are brought on through fear, and its effects upon the imagination, and are cured more by exciting of hope, than from any &s;pecific virtue of medicine. The death of Dr. Wal&s;h, and that of Dr. Pur|nel, is to be explained upon the &s;ame principles. They were no doubt brought up in the belief, that dangerous con&s;equences mu&s;t re&s;ult from inoculating them&s;elves with matter from putrid bodies; and I have not a doubt, but the fear ari&s;ing from this belief precipitated them into fevers, and mi&s;management after this into their graves. I have often experienced the effects of contagion in my own per&s;on; but being regardle&s;s of the con&s;e|quences, and being confident in my own plan of managing of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, I never experienced any bad effects from con|tagion.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>When the King went to Cheltenham, I mentioned to my friends, who are ready to prove what I &s;aid, that his di&s;ea&s;e would be encrea&s;ed, rather than be dimini&s;hed, by his drinking of the waters of that place. They were by no means &s;uitable to remove his di&s;ea&s;e, but to encrea&s;e it. I &s;u&s;pected that a drop&s;y, in&s;tead of a fever, would be the re&s;ult of his drinking the Cheltenham waters. If Sir George Baker, or any other phy&s;ician who&s;e advice had been called for at that time, had recommended a proper quantity of Madeira, indulgence in animal food, &amp;c. in&s;tead of ice creams, and vegetable prepa|rations, he might have the gout in his feet, which would be of infinite &s;ervice to him, in&s;tead of a fever, which unfortunately has affected the mo&s;t tender part of the nervous &s;y&s;tem.

<P>WHEN a practice of phy&s;ic de&s;tructive to our natures is pointed out by a man
<PB N="43" REF="62">of di&s;cernment and &s;cience, it is natural to pre&s;ume, that when the &s;y&s;tem of a popu|lar a&s;&s;ailant of the&s;e pernicious doctrines becomes general, that the opponents of a rational &s;y&s;tem of medical knowledge will, like Cae&s;ar, &s;oon &s;heath their &s;words, but never lay them a&s;ide. Death, one would &s;up|po&s;e they con&s;ider, as &s;ome morali&s;ts do, is a cure for all the evils we bring upon our|&s;elves; and that nature is tired of &s;uffering us to be for ever mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>FASHION, it mu&s;t be granted, flouri&s;hes too much in human affairs; and fa&s;hion prevails to an extreme in the healing art. If a duke, a lord, or any man of fa&s;hion em|ploys a phy&s;ician, his trade&s;men mu&s;t ape their manners, and do the &s;ame. If a phy|&s;ician, let his ignorance of his profe&s;&s;ion be ever &s;o great, can afford to keep up the formality of an equipage, and &s;uitable de|corations,
<PB N="44" REF="63">he is &s;ought after, and feed, while men of the greate&s;t abilities and learning are &s;uffered to walk the &s;treets un|heededly. And if a title is conferred upon them, they arrive at the &s;ummit of the hill, from whence they can &s;urvey the folly and vanity of mankind. They are then in a too elevated &s;ituation to be oppo&s;ed or que&s;tioned by itinerant phy&s;icians. They arrive at the <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> and mu&s;t be obeyed; and can, with the language of a dictator, &s;ay, like Cae&s;ar, <Q>"Leges re&s;pon|de&s;&s;et, multas et praeclaras tule&s;&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>WE need not wonder that di&s;ea&s;es a&s;|&s;ume a variety of appearances in different per&s;ons, no more than we wonder at &s;eeing different conformations of the body and the face in men and women. We might as well wonder, that in habits of &s;evere ex|erci&s;e, that the &s;weat appears fir&s;t of all
<PB N="45" REF="64">on the forehead. If two young men, who live preci&s;ely alike, either in ab&s;tinence, or in hard drinking, or in debauchery of all kinds, entail upon them&s;elves di&s;ea&s;es, one would &s;uppo&s;e that their re&s;pective com|plaints might re&s;emble, in appearance, each other; but it is a hundred to one if they do; for the more athletic may expe|rience &s;evere nervous feelings, while the more feeble is hurried off in a putrid fever. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with the fair &s;ex; and the parallel holds good. The one is pre|cipitated into convul&s;ions, when the other is labouring under a di&s;ea&s;e diametrically oppo&s;ite in appearance. Appearances of di&s;ea&s;es are nothing, the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es are the only requisites in the hands of a &s;kilful and di&s;cerning phy&s;ician; and when the cau&s;es are before him, if he unites phi|lo&s;ophy with experience, the cure is near at hand in all human di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>THE method of re&s;toring the King to his accu&s;tomed mental and bodily vigour, is, in my humble opinion, obvious.

He &s;hould never be contradicted, nor thwarted in any thing that he can reque&s;t, either in food or drink, unle&s;s he calls for vegetable food, and what are called diluting liquors. He &s;hould now indulge in animal food, and a proper quan|tity of wine. Mu&s;ic, provided it is not too loud, will be of great &s;ervice in the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health. He &s;hould refrain from all kind of &s;tudy and bu&s;i|ne&s;s, unle&s;s it is of an agreeable nature. He &s;hould avoid going out into the air, until the complaint leaves him entirely, otherwi&s;e the &s;malle&s;t chilline&s;s in the air
<PB N="47" REF="66">will convey it into the head.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The evidence of Sir George Baker, before a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Lords, is a compleat illu&s;tration of the prin|ciples and importance of the late Dr. Brown's doctrines in fe|vers, and all other nervous di&s;ea&s;es, the cau&s;es of which con&s;i&s;t in univer&s;al relaxation. Phy&s;icians have been too negligent in ob&s;erving the effects of cold applied to the human body in a &s;tate of debility; and there is not an evil of greater magnitude. Mar&s;h Mia&s;mata, as phy&s;icians call it, is nothing but cold and moi&s;ture applied to relaxed habits. But neither the e&s;&s;luvia ari&s;ing from putrid bodies, nor from bales of goods impreg|nated with the plague, nor the effects of the Grotto Del Cane, are by any means more dangerous, than the effects which are produced by cold upon relaxed habits. I have experienced, in my own per&s;on, repeatedly, the effects of what is called contagion; and I have al&s;o experienced, to a great degree, the effects of cold applied to the body in a relaxed &s;tate. But, if I had my choice in a &s;tate of debility, I would rather chu&s;e to be expo&s;ed to the opening of goods from the Levant, im|pregnated with the contagion of the plague, than be expo&s;ed to moi&s;ture and cold in the &s;ame &s;ituation.

The eruption which took place upon the body, was of peculiar uti|lity in tending to remove the di&s;ea&s;e. A warm room would have been a proper pre&s;cription at this time. And I am not aver&s;e to the belief, that pal&s;ies, apoplexies, and &s;udden death, are often the con&s;equences of going out into the air when the mind is unu&s;ually melancholy, and the body is greatly relaxed.</P></NOTE> His body ought therefore to be kept very warm with flannel cloaths. Soups are very pro|per. The &s;oups he takes ought to be made very rich of animal food, but much condi|ment
<PB N="48" REF="67">is not nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e preparations. His reque&s;ts ought to be implicitly ob|&s;erved. <Q>"FOR the reque&s;ts of kings," &s;ays Grotius, "have the &s;ame power as commands; and a denial, how ju&s;t &s;o|ever, &s;hall be by them as ill dige&s;ted as an injury."</Q> It was therefore a mo&s;t cruel act in tho&s;e who attended his Maje&s;ty, when he &s;aw through his window &s;ome of the prince&s;&s;es walk in the garden, to de|prive him of the plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction of &s;peaking to his beloved children. I have often, in this work, endeavoured to impre&s;s upon the minds of my readers, the extreme cruelty of depriving of mankind of their u&s;ual comforts and con&s;olations in &s;ome
<PB N="49" REF="68">nervous complaints. And what plea&s;ure in nature is there equal to the &s;eeing, even in a &s;tate of health, much more in a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, of tho&s;e we are by nature, as well as by habits of mutual love and in|tercour&s;e, to cheri&s;h and to admire.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;olacement to the mind of the King, is to be derived from reading to him, at proper &s;ea&s;ons, tho&s;e books which u&s;ed to afford him plea&s;ure when he was in a &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>DR. WILLIS appears, from his exami|nation before the Hou&s;e of Commons, to be a very &s;en&s;ible and di&s;cerning phy&s;ician, and &s;peaks of the cau&s;es which produce his Maje&s;ty's illne&s;s with perfect di&s;tinctne&s;s; &s;uch as weighty bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;evere exerci&s;e, extreme ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s, little re&s;t, &amp;c. The&s;e cau&s;es, of them&s;elves, are &s;ufficient
<PB N="50" REF="69">to produce a nervous fever, without the co-operation of other powers, tending to produce the &s;ame effect; &s;uch as bleeding, bli&s;tering, the debilitating operation of James's powders, and other medical pre|&s;criptions of the &s;ame nature. It appears, however, that the medicines given to his Maje&s;ty &s;ince Dr. Willis has been called in, have been attended with beneficial con&s;e|quences: And I am naturally led to &s;up|po&s;e, from the advantages which have hitherto re&s;ulted from them, that they mu&s;t have partaken of opium, which, if admini&s;tered with judgment and caution, and &s;upported in their efficacy by invigo|rating food, and proper vinous cordials, are qualified to produce the mo&s;t happy con&s;equences. The very rever&s;e is the ca&s;e with this medicine when injudiciou&s;ly made u&s;e of, which very often happens.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="70">
<P>I BEG leave to &s;ubmit one more thought upon this &s;ubject. It appears that his Maje&s;ty had experienced con&s;iderable relief, during the progre&s;s of his illne&s;s, in u&s;ing the warm bath; and I can venture to &s;peak with certainty, that the effects of the warm bath are prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, by being impregnated with the Peruvian bark, and aromatic herbs of all &s;orts. The only in|dication of cure is therefore to invigorate, by all po&s;&s;ible means, the body, and to af|ford every con&s;olation to the mind. This plan ought to be &s;tudied with much a&s;&s;i|duity by tho&s;e who attend his Maje&s;ty. For whatever produces an encrea&s;e of bo|dily relaxation, will, to a certainty, bring on a renewal of his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
