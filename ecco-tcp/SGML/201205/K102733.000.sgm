<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t Sketch of the following E&s;|&s;ays was wrote for the Service of a Friend, without any Intention of mine to have been an Author. When they were pub|li&s;hed, I was glad of the Opportunity which the &s;econd Edition of the Anatomy of the Bones gave me to correct them, and I thought Mr. <HI>Win&s;low</HI>'s Anatomy made a|ny further Labour of mine on the&s;e Subjects unnece&s;&s;ary. But whenever it was fore&s;een that this third Edition of the O&s;teology was to be printed, I was teazed with the Impor|tunities of Friends and Scholars, to make the Anatomy of the Nerves more complete, and to tack the other two E&s;&s;ays to it. It was in vain for me to plead the Difficulty, if not Impo&s;&s;ibility of bringing the Phy&s;iolo|gy of the Nerves to any Certainty, tho' it might engage me in an endle&s;s Di&s;pute; and that any other De&s;cription of the Di&s;tribu|tion of the Nerves, than what Mr. <HI>Win|&s;low</HI> had given, was altogether &s;uper&s;tuous: They in&s;i&s;ted, would not be refu&s;ed, and forced me to undertake it.</P>
<P>In the Account of the Nerves in general, I have avoided what I could to give Of|fence; and therefore have not only treated all the Opinions I mention with that Mode|&s;ty which the Uncertainty of the Subject re|quired,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">but have not named one Author, flat|tering my&s;elf, that tho&s;e, whom I was under the Nece&s;&s;ity to redargue, might be better con|cealed by my not declaring whom I approved.</P>
<P>I attempted an accurate De&s;cription of the particular Nerves; but upon compar|ing the Notes I wrote of what I &s;aw in di&s;|&s;ecting the Nerves with Mr. <HI>Win&s;low</HI>'s <HI>Expo&s;ition des Ner&s;s,</HI> I found I had done little more than u&s;ed other Words for de|&s;cribing the &s;ame Things; and upon giving my Papers to be peru&s;ed by &s;ome of tho&s;e for who&s;e. U&s;e any Thing I write is chiefly in|tended, I mean the Students in Phy&s;ick, I di&s;covered another Misfortune &s;ufficient to make me alter my De&s;ign. The young A|natomi&s;ts were &s;o confounded with the Va|riety of Branches and their Sub-divi&s;ions, that they could not &s;ee even the gro&s;s Out|lines of the Picture I had attempted to draw. That I might be under&s;tood, and my Scholars might thereby be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to remem|ber the more minute Di&s;&s;ections I &s;hou'd &s;hew them, I changed my Notes into a &s;u|perficial De&s;cription of the larger Branches of the Nerves.</P>
<P>The Account of the <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI> and <HI>Dia&s;tole</HI> of the Heart is the immortal <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s Doctrine illu&s;trated, and the De&s;cription of the <HI>Receptaculum Chyli,</HI> and of the <HI>Du|ctus Thoracicus</HI> is nearly the &s;ame as it was in the former Edition.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANATOMY OF THE <HI>Human Nerves.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Nerves in general.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1._BY the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Injections and Micro&s;copes wonderful Plexu&s;es of Blood-ve&s;&s;els are di&s;covered to go from the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> into the <HI>Cortex,</HI> cincri|tious, or a&s;hy-coloured Part of the <HI>Cerebrum, Cerebellum</HI> and <HI>&s;pinal Marrow,</HI> whereas we can only &s;ee longitudinal Ve&s;&s;els, without nu|merous Ramifications or reticular Plexu&s;es, in the white medullary Sub&s;tance of the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Continuity of the <HI>Cortex</HI> with the <HI>Medulla</HI> of the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>&s;pinal Marrow</HI> is ob&s;ervable with the naked Eye, and is more di&s;tinctly &s;een with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Micro|&s;cope.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<P N="3">3. In di&s;&s;ecting the <HI>Brain</HI> and <HI>Cerebellum,</HI> we &s;ee the &s;mall Beginnings of the <HI>Medulla</HI> proceeding from the <HI>Cortex,</HI> and can trace its gradual Increa&s;e by the Addition of more <HI>Me|dulla</HI> coming from the <HI>Cortex.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Both <HI>Cortex</HI> and <HI>Medulla</HI> are very &s;uccu|lent; for being expo&s;ed to the Air to dry, they lo&s;e more of their Weight than mo&s;t other Parts of the Body do.</P>
<P N="5">5. In &s;everal Places we can ob&s;erve the <HI>Me|dulla</HI> to be compo&s;ed of Fibres laid at each o|ther's Sides.</P>
<P N="6">6. The medullary Sub&s;tance is all employed in forming the white fibrous Cords, which have now the Name of <HI>Nerves</HI> appropriated to them. Within the Skull we &s;ee the Nerves to be the medullary &s;ub&s;tance continued, and the <HI>medulla &s;pinalis</HI> is all employed in forming Nerves.</P>
<P N="7">7. The common Opinion concerning the Ri&s;e of the Nerves, founded on a &s;uperficial In&s;pection of tho&s;e Parts, is, that the Nerves are propagated from the &s;ame Side of the <HI>En|cephalon</HI> at which they go out. But it having been remarked, after a more &s;trict Enquiry, and preparing the Parts by Maceration in Wa|ter, that the medullary Fibres decu&s;&s;ate or cro&s;s each other in &s;ome Parts of the <HI>Medulla;</HI> as for Example, at the <HI>Corpus annulare,</HI> and Beginning of the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis:</HI> And practi|cal Ob&s;ervators having related &s;everal Ex|amples of People, who&s;e Brain was hurt on one Side, while the morbid Symptom, Pal&s;y, appeared on the other Side of the Body, of which I have &s;een two In&s;tances; and Experi|ments made on Brutes having confirmed the&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="6">Ob&s;ervations, it has been thought, that the Nerves had their Ri&s;e from the Side of the <HI>En|cephalon,</HI> oppo&s;ite to their Egre&s;s from the Skull. It may however &s;till be &s;aid, that this la&s;t Opinion is not fully demon&s;trated, becau&s;e a Decu&s;&s;ation in &s;ome few Parts is not a Proof that it obtains univer&s;ally; and if there are Ex|amples of Pal&s;y of the Side oppo&s;ite to where the Le&s;ion of the Brain was, there are al&s;o o|thers, where the Injury done to the Brain and the Pal&s;y were both on the &s;ame Side.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Nerves are compo&s;ed of a great ma|ny Threads lying parallel, where they come out from the <HI>Medulla.</HI></P>
<P>This fibrous Texture is evident at the Ori|gin of mo&s;t of the Nerves within the Skull, and in the <HI>Cauda equine</HI> of the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> we can divide them into &s;uch &s;mall Threads, that a very quick-&s;ighted Eye can &s;carce per|ceive them; but the&s;e Threads, when looked at with a Micro&s;cope, appear each to be com|po&s;ed of a great Number of &s;maller Threads.</P>
<P N="9">9. How &s;mall one of the&s;e Fibrils of the Nerves is we know not, but when we con&s;i|der that every, even the mo&s;t minute Part of the Body is &s;en&s;ible, and that this mu&s;t depend on the Nerves (which all conjoined would not make a Cord of an Inch Diameter) being divided into Branches or Filaments to be di&s;|per&s;ed through all the&s;e minute Parts, we mu&s;t be convinced that the nervous Fibrils are very &s;mall. From the Examination of the <HI>mini|mum vi&s;ibile</HI> it is demon&s;trated, that each Fibre in the <HI>Retina</HI> of the Eye, or expanded optick Nerve, cannot exceed the Size of the 32400 Part of a Hair.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<P N="10">10. The medullary Sub&s;tance, of which the nervous Fibrils are compo&s;ed, is very ten|der, and would not be able to re&s;i&s;t the com|mon Force of the circulating Fluids, and other &s;uch Forces to which the Nerves are expo&s;ed within the Bones, were not the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> and <HI>Tunica Arachnoides</HI> continued upon them. The former giving them Firmne&s;s and Strength, and the latter furni&s;hing a cellular Coat to connect the Threads of the Nerves, to let them ly &s;oft and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, and to &s;upport the Ve&s;&s;els which go with them.</P>
<P>It is this cellular Sub&s;tance that is di&s;tended with Air when it is blown through a Blow|pipe thru&s;t into a Nerve, and that makes a Nerve appear all &s;pungy, after being di&s;tended with Air till it dries, the proper nervous Fibrils &s;hriveling &s;o in drying as they &s;carce can be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="11">11. The&s;e Coats, &sect; 10. would not make the Nerves &s;trong enough to bear the &s;tretching and Pre&s;&s;ure they are expo&s;ed to in their Cour&s;e to the different Parts of the Body; and therefore as the Nerves are going out at the Holes in the <HI>Cranium</HI> and <HI>Spine,</HI> the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> is clo&s;ely wrapt round them, to collect their di&s;gregated Fibres into ten&s;e firm Cords, and that the &s;tretching they may be expo&s;ed to may have no Effect to hurt them where they are not &s;trength|ned thus by the <HI>Dura Mater;</HI> this &s;trong Membrane is firmly fixed to the Sides of the Holes in the Bones through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="12">12. The nervous Cords thus compo&s;ed of nervous Fibrils, cellular Coat, <HI>Pia</HI> and <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> have &s;uch numerous Blood-ve&s;&s;els be|&s;towed on them, that after their Arteries only
<PB N="5" REF="8">are injected, the whole Cord can be tinged of the Colour of the injected Liquor; and if the Injection is pu&s;hed too violently, the cellular Sub&s;tance of the Nerves comes to be di&s;tended with it.</P>
<P N="13">13. A nervous Cord, &s;uch as has been ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, &sect; 12. has very little Ela&s;ticity, compared with other Parts of the Body. When cut out of the Body, it does not become ob&s;er|vably &s;horter, while the Blood-ve&s;&s;els contract three Eighths of their Length.</P>
<P N="14">14. In the Cour&s;e which the Nerves have to the &s;everal Parts of the Body, they are gene|rally lodged in a cellular or fatty &s;ub&s;tance, and run in the Inter&s;tices of the Mu&s;cles and other active Organs, that &s;o they might be little expo&s;ed to the Pre&s;&s;ure which the&s;e Parts would make upon them, and might be defen|ded from any bad Effects which &s;uch Pre&s;&s;ure might otherwi&s;e produce.</P>
<P N="15">15. The larger Cords of the Nerves divide into Branches in their Di&s;tribut on to the dif|ferent Parts; the Branches being &s;maller than the Trunk from which they come, and making generally an acute angle where they &s;eparate.</P>
<P N="16">16. In &s;everal Places different Nerves unite into one Cord, which is commonly larger than any of the Nerves which form <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P N="17">17. Several Nerves, particularly tho&s;e which are di&s;tributed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, &s;udden|ly form a hard Knot. con&s;iderably larger than all the Nerves of which it is made. The&s;e Knots were called <HI>Corpora olivaria,</HI> and are now generally named <HI>Ganglions.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. The <HI>Ganglions</HI> have much thicker Coats and larger, more numerous Blood-ve&s;&s;els than
<PB N="6" REF="9">the Nerves, &s;o that they appear redder and more mu&s;cular. On di&s;&s;ecting the <HI>Ganglions,</HI> Fibres are &s;een running longitudinally in their Axes, and other Fibres are derived from their Sides in an oblique direction to the longitudi|nal ones.</P>
<P N="19">19. The Nerves which go out from the <HI>Ganglions</HI> are no way remarkably different from other Nerves.</P>
<P N="20">20. The Nerves that are &s;ent to our Organs of the Sen&s;es lo&s;e there their firm Coats, and terminate in a pulpy Sub&s;tance. The <HI>optick Nerves</HI> are expanded into the &s;oft tender Webs the <HI>Retinae;</HI> the <HI>auditory Nerve</HI> has &s;carce the Con&s;i&s;tence of <HI>Mucus</HI> in the <HI>Ve&s;tibulum, Co|chlea</HI> and <HI>&s;emicircular Canals</HI> of each Ear; the <HI>Papillae</HI> of the No&s;e, Tongue and Skin are ve|ry &s;oft.</P>
<P N="21">21. The Nerves of Mu&s;cles can likewi&s;e be traced till they lo&s;e their Coats and become very &s;oft, from which, and what we ob&s;erved of the &s;en&s;atory Nerves, &sect; 20. there is Rea&s;on to conclude, that the mu&s;cular Nerves are al|&s;o pulpy at their Terminations, which we can|not indeed pro&s;ecute by Di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P N="22">22. It would &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary that the Extremities of the Nerves &s;hould continue in this &s;oft flexible State, (&sect; 20, 21.) in order to per|form their Functions right: For in proportion as Parts become rigid and firm by Age, or any other Cau&s;e, they lo&s;e of their Sen&s;ibility, and the Motions are more difficultly performed.</P>
<P N="23">23. Tho' the Fibres in a nervous Cord are firmly connected, and frequently different Nerves join into one Trunk, or into the &s;ame <HI>Ganglion,</HI> yet the Sen&s;ation of each Part of the
<PB N="7" REF="10">Body is &s;o very di&s;tinct; and we have &s;o much the Power of moving the Mu&s;cles &s;eparate|ly, that, if the Nerves are principal Agents in the&s;e two Functions, which I &s;hall endeavour to prove they are, we have Rea&s;on to believe that there is no Union, Confu&s;ion or immedi|ate Communication of the proper nervous Fi|brils, but that each Fibre remains di&s;tinct from its Origin to its Termination.</P>
<P N="24">24. Changes produced any way upon the Coats of the Nerves cannot however mi&s;s to affect the nervous Fibrils. The cellular Sub|&s;tance may be too full of Liquor or may not &s;upply enough; the Liquor may not be of a due Con&s;i&s;tence, or it may be preternaturally ob&s;tructed and collected. The <HI>Pia Mater</HI> may be too ten&s;e or too lax, as may al&s;o the <HI>Dura Mater;</HI> their Ve&s;&s;els may be ob&s;tructed; their proper Nerves may be violently irritated or lo&s;e their Power of acting; and a great many other &s;uch Changes may happen which will not only occa&s;ion Di&s;orders in particular Nerves, but may cau&s;e the <HI>Sympathy</HI> &s;o fre|quently Ob&s;erved among the Nerves, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be attentively regarded in a great many Di&s;ea&s;es in order to di&s;cover their true State and Nature, without the Knowledge of which we mu&s;t commit very dangerous Mi&s;|takes in the Practice of Phy&s;ick and Surgery.</P>
<P N="25">25. Many Experiments and Ob&s;ervations concur in proving, that when Nerves are com|pre&s;&s;ed, cut, or any other way de&s;troyed, the Parts &s;erved by &s;uch Nerves farther from the Head or Spine than where the injuring Cau&s;e has been applied have their Sen&s;ations, Moti|ous and Nouri&s;hment weakned or lo&s;t, while
<PB N="8" REF="11">no &s;uch Effects are &s;een in the Parts nearer to the Origins of tho&s;e Nerves; and in &s;uch Experiments where the Cau&s;e impeding the Nerves to exert them&s;elves could be removed, and the Structure of the Nerves not injured; as for Example, when a Ligature made upon a Nerve and &s;topping its Influence has been taken away, the Motion and Sen&s;ation of the Parts &s;oon were re&s;tored. From which it would appear that the Nerves are principal In&s;truments in our Sen&s;ations, Motions and Nouri&s;hment; and that this Influence of the Nerves is not inherent in them without the Communication between the&s;e Cords, and their Origin is pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>It will be no Objection to this Conclu&s;ion, that &s;ometimes, upon cutting a Nerve, the Ef|fects above-mentioned have been felt for a &s;hort Time, but afterwards the Per&s;on was &s;en&s;ible of no Numne&s;s or Immobility; for wherever this is &s;aid to have happened, the cut Nerve was only one of &s;everal which were &s;ent to the Member, the want of who&s;e Influence would be felt no longer than till the Habit was acquired of performing the Functi|ons ca&s;ily by the other Nerves.</P>
<P>It is of no greater Weight as an Objection, that when a Ligature is drawn very hard upon a Nerve, the Nerve never again recovers its Influence upon the Parts it is di&s;tributed to be|yond the Ligature, but is of as little Effect as if it had, been cut thro'; which is to &s;ay, that its Texture has been alter'd beyond Recovery. The &s;ame Thing is to be &s;een by tying a Thread tight round a tender Twig of any ve|getable, it decays.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<P N="26">26. Experiments and Ob&s;ervations &s;hew too, that when Parts of the <HI>Encephalon</HI> or <HI>Me|dulla &s;pinalis</HI> have been irritated, compre&s;&s;ed or de&s;troyed, the Parts of the Body, who&s;e Nerves had their Origin from &s;uch affected Parts of the <HI>Encephalon</HI> or <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> became convul&s;ed, paralytick, in&s;en&s;ible or wa&s;ted; and in &s;uch Ca&s;es where the injuring Cau&s;e could be removed from the Origin of the Nerves, the morbid Symptoms ob&s;erved in the Parts to which the&s;e Nerves were di&s;|tributed, went off upon the Removal of that Cau&s;e. From which it is thought rea&s;onable to conclude, that the Nerves mu&s;t not only have a Communication with their Origin, but that the Influence they have upon the Parts they are di&s;tributed to, depends on the Influence which they derive from the <HI>Medulla Encephali</HI> and <HI>&s;pinalis.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. Tho' the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis</HI> has its own Ve&s;&s;els and cineritious Sub&s;tance which a&s;&s;i&s;ts to form its <HI>Medulla,</HI> yet a very large Share of the Medullary Sub&s;tance within the Spine is derived from the <HI>Encephalon,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Medulla oblongata</HI> de&s;cends from the Head, and the In|fluence of the <HI>Medulla &s;pinallis</HI> on its Nerves depends in a great Mea&s;ure on this <HI>Medulla oblongata</HI> of the Head. Hence an Injury done to any Part of the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis</HI> immediate|ly affects all the Parts who&s;e Nerves have their Origin below where the injuring Cau&s;e is applied to the Spinal Marrow. A Luxa|tion of a <HI>Vertebra</HI> in the Loins makes the low|er Extremities &s;oon paralytick; a tran&s;ver&s;e Section of the <HI>Medulla</HI> at the fir&s;t <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck &s;oon puts an End to Life.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<P N="28">28. If &s;uch Cau&s;es produce con&s;tantly &s;uch Effects (&sect; 25, 26, 27,) in us and other Creatures living in nearly the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances as we do, the Conclu&s;ions already made will be good, notwith&s;tanding Exam|ples of Children and other Creatures being born without <HI>Brains</HI> or <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis;</HI> or notwith&s;tanding the Brains of adult Creatures being much changed in their Texture by Di&s;|ea&s;es, and notwith&s;tanding the Experiments of cutting off the Heads of <HI>Tortoi&s;es,</HI> and &s;ome o|ther Animals which continued to move about a con&s;iderable Time after their Heads were off. We may be ignorant of the particular Circum&s;tances requi&s;ite or nece&s;&s;ary to the Be|ing or Wellbeing of this or that particular Creature, and we may be unable to account for a great many Phaenomena; but we mu&s;t be|lieve our Eyes in the Examination of Facts, and if we &s;ee con&s;tantly &s;uch Con&s;equences from &s;uch Actions, we cannot but conclude the one to be the Cau&s;e, and the other the Ef|fect. It would be as unju&s;t to deny the Con|clu&s;ions made in the three preceeding Ar|ticles, becau&s;e of the &s;eemingly preternatural Phaenomena mentioned in the Beginning of this, as it would be to deny the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Circulation of the Blood in us and Qua|drupeds, becau&s;e a Frog can jump about or a Tortoi&s;e can walk long after all the Bowels of its Thorax and Abdomen are taken out, or be|cau&s;e the different Parts of a Worm crawl af|ter it has heen cut into a great many Pieces. It is therefore almo&s;t univer&s;ally agreed that the Nerves are principal In&s;truments in our Sen&s;ations, Motion and Nouri&s;hment, and
<PB N="11" REF="14">that the Influence which they have is commu|nicated from their Origin, the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>Medulla &s;pinallis;</HI> but Authors are far from a|greeing about the Manner in which this In|fluence is communicated, or in what Way Nerves act to produce the&s;e Effects.</P>
<P N="29">29. Some alledge that <HI>the nervous Fibres are all &s;olid Cords acting by Ela&s;ticity or Vibra|tion.</HI> Others affirm that <HI>tho&s;e Fibres are &s;mall Pipes conveying Liquors, by means of which all their Effects are produced.</HI></P>
<P N="30">30. The Gentlemen, who think the nervous Fibres &s;olid, rai&s;e &s;everal Objections to the o|ther Doctrine, which I &s;hall con&s;ider after|wards, and endeavour to &s;hew the Fitne&s;s of their own Doctrine to account for the Effects commonly ob&s;erved to be produced by the Nerves.</P>
<P>The Objects of the Sen&s;es plainly, &s;ay they, make Impul&s;es on the Nerves of the proper Organs, which mu&s;t &s;hake the nervous Fi|brils, and this Vibration mu&s;t be propagated a|long the whole Cord to its other Extremity or Origin, as happens in other ten&s;e Strings; and the&s;e Vibrations being differently modified ac|cording to the Difference of the Object, and its different Application, produce the different Ideas we have of Objects.</P>
<P N="31">31. To this Account of the Sen&s;ations it is objected, 1&s;t, That Nerves are unfit for Vibra|tions, becau&s;e their Extremities, where Ob|jects are applied to them, are quite &s;oft and pappy, (&sect; 20.) and not &s;u&s;ceptible of the Vi|brations &s;uppo&s;ed; and if there could be any little Tremor made here by the Impul&s;e of Ob|jects, it could not be continued along the ner|vous

<P>The 2<HI>d</HI> Objection to this Doctrine is, that, &s;uppo&s;ing the Nerves capable of Vibrations by the Impre&s;&s;ions of Objects, the&s;e Vibrations would not an&s;wer the De&s;ign.

<P N="32">32. In whatever way the Favourers of the Doctrine of &s;olid Nerves plea&s;e to apply the

<P N="33">33. As a further Objection again&s;t either Motion or Sen&s;ation being owing to the E|la&s;ticity of the Nerves, it is &s;aid, that if this Doctrine was true, the Sen&s;ations would be more acute, and the Contractions of Mu&s;cles would be greater and &s;tronger, when the Parts become firmer and more rigid by Age; for then their Ela&s;ticity is increa&s;ed: Whereas on the contrary it appears, (&sect; 22.) that then the Sen&s;ations are blunted, and mu&s;cular Con|traction becomes le&s;s and weaker.</P>

<P N="35">35. Having thus &s;tated the Rea&s;ons for and again&s;t the Nerves acting as &s;olid Strings, let us likewi&s;e relate the Arguments for Nerves being Pipes, and the Objections to this Do|ctrine.</P>
<P>A great Argument of tho&s;e who think the Nerves to be Tubes conveying Liquors, is the &s;trong Analogy of the Brain and Nerves to o|ther Glands of the Body and their Excretories, where a manife&s;t Secretion of Liquor is made in the Glands to be conveyed by the Excre|tories, to the proper Places in which it ought to be depo&s;ited: They think that the va&s;cular Texture of the Cortex of the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis</HI> (&sect; 1.); the Continuation of the Cortex in forming the medullary Sub|&s;tance (&sect; 2.3.), the fibrous Texture (&sect; 5.) and &s;ucculent State of this <HI>Medulla</HI> (&sect; 4.), and its being wholly employed to form the Nerves (&sect;6.), where the fibrous Texture is evident (&sect;8.); all the&s;e Things, &s;ay they, con&s;pire to &s;hew &s;uch a &s;trong Analogy between the&s;e Parts and the other Glands of the Body, as carries a Conviction that there is a Liquor &s;e|creted in the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> to be &s;ent out by the Nerves to the different Parts of the Body.</P>
<P N="36">36. The following Objections are rai&s;ed to this Argument in favour of a Liquor convey|ed in the Nerves, from the Analogy of the Glands. <HI>1&s;t,</HI> Other Glands, it is &s;aid, have their Excretories collected into a few large Pipes, and not continued in &s;uch a great Num|ber of &s;eparate Pipes, as far as the Places
<PB N="15" REF="18">where the Liquors are depo&s;ited, which la&s;t mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e, if the Nerves are the Ex|cretories of the glandular Brain. 2<HI>dly,</HI> We &s;ee the Cavities and can examine the Liquors in the Excretories of other Glands much &s;mal|ler than the Brain, which cannot be done in the Nerves. 3<HI>dly,</HI> If the Nerves were Pipes, they would be &s;o &s;mall that the Attraction of their Sides to their Liquors would be &s;o great, that the Liquors could not be moved with the Celerity required to influence our Sen&s;ations and Motions, in the quick Manner we &s;ee them performed. 4<HI>thly,</HI> If the Nerves were Pipes they would be cylindrical ones, and con&s;equently not &s;ubject to Di&s;ea&s;es, or at lea&s;t we could have no Comprehen&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;es in them.</P>
<P N="37">37. The An&s;wer to the 1&s;t of the&s;e Ob|jections is, That there are other Glands where there is a manife&s;t Secretion, and in which the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Excretories is in much the &s;ame way as in the <HI>Encephalon;</HI> the Kidneys, for Example, have a reticulated Cortex of Ve&s;&s;els, from which the <HI>Eu&s;tachian</HI> or <HI>Bellinian Medulla,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of longitudinal Fibres and a few longitudinal Blood Ve&s;&s;els, proceeds; and this <HI>Medulla</HI> is collected into ten or twelve <HI>Papillae,</HI> each of which is formed of numer|ous &s;mall &s;eparate Pipes, which &s;ingly di&s;|charge the Urine into the large membranous Tubes, which united compo&s;e the <HI>Pelvis.</HI> Upon comparing this Texture of the Kidney with what was &s;aid of the <HI>Encephalon,</HI> (&sect; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.) the Analogy will be found very &s;trong.</P>
<P N="38">38. In An&s;wer to the 2<HI>d</HI> Objection in &sect; 36.
<PB N="16" REF="19">it is granted, that Micro&s;copes, Injections, and all the other Arts hitherto employed have not &s;hewn the Cavities of the nervous Fibrils, or the Liquors contained in them; and from what was &s;aid (&sect; 9.) of the &s;mallne&s;s of the nervous Fibrils, it is not to be expected that ever they &s;hould be &s;een. But &s;o long as &s;uch a Number of little Animals can every Hour be brought to the Framers of this Objection, in which they can as little demon&s;trate the Ve&s;&s;els or contained Fluids, it will not be al|lowed to be conclu&s;ive Rea&s;oning, that be|cau&s;e ocular Demon&s;tration cannot be given of Pipes, therefore they do not exi&s;t. For if we have any Notion of an Animal, it is its being a Hydraulick Machine, which has Li|quors moving in it as long as it has Life; if therefore &s;uch little Animals have Ve&s;&s;els and Liquors which we cannot &s;ee, why may not &s;ome of the Ve&s;&s;els and Liquors of the hu|man Body be al&s;o invi&s;ible to us.</P>
<P>To avoid this An&s;wer to the Objection, it is further urged that tho' we might not &s;ee the Canals and Liquors of Nerves as they are flowing naturally, yet they ought to di&s;cover them&s;elves by the Canals being &s;tretched, or a Nerve's &s;welling upon being firmly tied; and it might likewi&s;e be expected, that how|ever &s;ubtile the Liquor of the Nerves is, it might be collected in &s;ome Drops at lea&s;t, when the cut End of a Nerve of a living Animal is kept &s;ome Time in the exhau&s;ted Receiver of an Air-Pump. It is affirmed, that neither did the tied Nerve &s;well between the Brain and Ligature, nor was there any Liquor collected in the Receiver of the Air-Pump, from which
<PB N="17" REF="20">it is concluded that there is no Liquor in the Nerves.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome Difference among tho&s;e who &s;ay they have tried the&s;e Experiments, &s;ome affirming that in young Animals the Nerve does &s;well above the Ligature, and that a Li|quor does drill out upon cutting a Nerve. But allowing the Experiments to &s;ucceed any way, the Reply to the Inference from them is, that in neither way are they any thing to the Pur|po&s;e; for the &s;welling of the Nerve after it is tied, or the Efflux of Liquors from its Ex|tremity, will never prove either to be the Ef|fect of the Fluid in the proper nervous Fibrils, &s;o long as they might be occa&s;ioned by the Li|quors in the larger Ve&s;&s;els of the cellular Sub|&s;tance of the Nerves; and if the&s;e &s;ame Ve&s;|&s;els of the Coats of the Nerves do not dis|cover their Liquors by the&s;e Experiments, it is far le&s;s to be expected that the much more &s;ubtile Nerves &s;hould.</P>
<P N="39">39. The 3<HI>d</HI> Objection to the Doctrine of the Brain being a Gland, and the Nerves its Ex|cretories, &s;uppo&s;es a more rapid Motion ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the Fluid of the Nerves, than what mo&s;t of the Defenders of the nervous Fluid will now allow, and is afterwards to be con|&s;idered particularly in a more proper Place.</P>
<P N="40">40. The 4<HI>th</HI> Objection being, that if Nerves are Excretories of a Gland, they mu&s;t be cy|lindrical Pipes, in which no Ob&s;tructions or Di&s;ea&s;es would happen; but &s;ince we daily &s;ee Di&s;ea&s;es in the Nerves, they mu&s;t there|fore not be &s;uch Excretories. The An&s;wer is, That Di&s;ea&s;es happen often in the Excretories of other Glands as of the Liver, Kidneys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="21">notwith&s;tanding their cylindrical Form, and their much &s;horter and le&s;s expo&s;ed Cour&s;e. When we con&s;ider the very tender Sub&s;tance of the Brain; the va&s;t Complication of Ve&s;&s;els there; the prodigious Smalne&s;s of the Pipes going out from it; the many moving Powers which the Nerves are to undergo the &s;hock of; and the many Chances which the Ve&s;&s;els, Membranes and cellular Sub&s;tance accom|panying the Nerves have of being di&s;ordered, and then affecting the nervous Fibrils, we have very great Rea&s;on to be &s;urprized, that the&s;e cylindrical Pipes are not much more fre|quently put out of Order by too great or too &s;mall a Quantity of Liquors; by too vi&s;cid or too thin Fluids; by Liquors con&s;i&s;ting of too mild and &s;luggi&s;h Particles, or of too acrid pungent ones; by too great or too little Mo|tion given to the Liquors; by the Diameters of the Pipes being too much &s;traitned, or too much enlarged; and by a great many other Va|rieties of Circum&s;tances which might be &s;up|po&s;ed capable of di&s;turbing the Functions of the Nerves, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be cylindrical Excretories of the Gland the Brain.</P>
<P N="41">41. The numerous Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Encepha|lon</HI> have brought &s;ome of the Gentlemen who defend the Opinion of the Nerves being &s;olid, to acknowledge, that there is a Liquor &s;e|creted in the Brain; but then they will not al|low that this Liquor is &s;ent out by the proper nervous Fibrils, but that it is poured into the cellular Sub&s;tance in which the Nerves ly, to keep them moi&s;t and &s;upple, and therefore fit for exerting their Ela&s;ticity, Vibration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="22">by which, in their Opinion, the Effects com|monly a&s;cribed to Nerves are produced.</P>
<P N="42">42. Be&s;ides the Objections already men|tioned (&sect; 31, 32,) again&s;t the Nerves acting as ela&s;tick Strings, this Opinion has &s;ome other Difficulties attending it, that may be urged as Objections to it; &s;uch as, there is not one Example in the Body of Liquors &s;ecreted in a large Gland being poured into a cellular Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tance, as here &s;uppo&s;ed; the Liquors in the Cells of the <HI>tunica cellularis</HI> of other Parts are &s;eparated from the little Arteries which are di&s;tributed to the&s;e Cells.</P>
<P>Further, it can't be well determined, how a Liquor &s;ecreted in the <HI>Cortex</HI> of the Brain &s;hould make its Way through the <HI>Medulla</HI> to come out into the cellular Membranes on the Surface of that <HI>Medulla.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> A very &s;imple Experiment of inje|cting Water by the Artery of any Member, and thereby filling the cellular &s;ub&s;tance of the Nerves of that Member, &s;hews evidently that the Liquor of the <HI>tunica cellularis</HI> of the Nerves has the &s;ame Fountain as the Liquor in the <HI>tunica cellularis</HI> has any where el&s;e, that is, from the little Arteries di&s;per&s;ed upon it.</P>
<P N="43">43. The Doctrine of a Fluid in the Nerves is not only thus &s;upported by the Analogy of the Brain and Nerves to the other Glands and their Excretories, but tho&s;e who maintain this Doctrine mention an Experiment which they think directly probative of a Fluid in the Nerves; it is this. After opening the Tho|rax of a living Dog, catch hold of and pre&s;s one or both the phrenic Nerves with the Fingers, the <HI>Diaphragm</HI> immediately cea&s;es
<PB N="20" REF="23">to contract; then let go the hold of the Nerves, and the Mu&s;cle acts again: Pinch a &s;econd time the Nerve or Nerves &s;ome way above the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> this Mu&s;cle again cea&s;es to act: Keep firm the Hold of the Nerve, and with the Fingers of the other Hand &s;trip it down from the gripping Fingers towards the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> and the Mu&s;cle is made to contract; and for three or four &s;uch Stripings its Action follows or obeys the Motion of the Fingers which &s;trip it down; then it becomes di&s;obedient, and will contract no more, &s;trip as you will, un|le&s;s the Fingers gripping or pinching the Nerve let go their Hold, or are removed higher up upon the Nerve, when the Mu&s;cle may again be made to contract by &s;tripping the Nerve down towards it. This Experiment I have done with the Succe&s;s here mentioned. Let any one try if he can imagine any other rea&s;on|able Account of the&s;e Appearances, than that the gripping Fingers &s;topt the Cour&s;e of a Fluid in the Nerve; that what of this Fluid was thus made to &s;tagnate in the Part of the Nerve between the gripping Fingers and <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> was forced down into that Mu&s;cle by the Pre&s;|&s;ure of the Fingers which &s;tripped the Nerve down; and when ever this &s;tagnating Fluid was pre&s;&s;ed all away by &s;everal Repetitions of &s;tripping the Nerve, the Mu&s;cle being &s;up|plied with no more Fluid contracted no more, till upon removing the Fingers which had hold of the Nerve, a new Supply of Liquor was brought from the Brain, or from the Part of the Nerve that had not yet been grip'd or &s;trip|ped; and when ever this Liquor could make its Way down to the Mu&s;cle, or was forced
<PB N="21" REF="24">down to it, the Mu&s;cle immediately began to renew its contractile Motions.</P>
<P N="44">44. Some Gentlemen convinced of the Rea|&s;onablene&s;s of the Secretion of a Liquor in the Brain to be &s;ent out by the Nerves, but not comprehending how a Fluid could have &s;uch a rapid retrograde Motion as they imagined was nece&s;&s;ary for conveying the Impre&s;&s;ions of Ob|jects made on the Extremities of Nerves to the <HI>Sen&s;orium,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed two Sorts of Nerves, one that conveyed a Liquor for mu&s;cular Mo|tion and Nutrition; the other compo&s;ed of &s;o|lid Nerves, that were to &s;erve for the Organs of the Sen&s;es, to convey the Vibrations com|municated from Objects to the <HI>Sen&s;orium.</HI></P>
<P N="45">45. The Objections mentioned (&sect; 31.) a|gain&s;t the &s;en&s;atory Nerves acting by Vibra|tions take place here: And further, there is nothing in the Texture either of the Brain or Nerves, which gives any Rea&s;on to think, that the Nerves are differently formed; on the con|trary, the Structure is every where &s;imilar, and often Branches of the &s;ame Nerve &s;erve both for Sen&s;ation and Motion. What occa&s;ioned ju&s;tly a Prejudice again&s;t the Scheme of our Sen&s;ations depending on a Fluid in the Nerves, to wit, the rapid Refluxes &s;uppo&s;ed in the &s;en&s;i|tive Nerves, is an Opinion now de&s;erted ge|nerally by the Defenders of the nervous Fluid, for Rea&s;ons to be given in a little, tho' their Opponents are &s;till willing to palm it on them, whereby they may have a better Handle again&s;t the general Doctrine of the nervous Fluid.</P>
<P N="46">46. This &s;ame rapid Refluxat was too, which gave Ri&s;e to another Divi&s;ion of the Nerves into arterious or effluent, and venous or reflu|ent.
<PB N="22" REF="25">It was &s;aid, that mu&s;cular Motion and Nutrition depended on the arterious Nerves, and that the Sen&s;ations depended on an accele|rated Motion of the nervous Fluid towards the Brain, by the Impre&s;&s;ions which the Ob|jects of the Sen&s;es make upon the venous Nerves. By this Suppo&s;ition the Ab&s;urdity of rapid Fluxes and Refluxes in the &s;ame Canal was prevented, and an Advantage was thought to be gained by it, of &s;aving too great a W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;te of the Fluid of the Nerves, which otherwi&s;e the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis</HI> could not &s;upply in &s;ufficient Quantity to an&s;wer all the Exigencies of Life.</P>
<P N="47">47. To this Opinion (&sect; 46.) it has been objected, 1. That there is no Example in the Body of a &s;ecreted Liquor being returned im|mediately and unmixed to the Gland by which it was originally &s;eparated from the Ma&s;s of Blood, which would be the Ca&s;e were there venous Nerves. 2<HI>dly,</HI> There is no Occa&s;ion for &s;aving the Fluid of the Nerves in the Way propo&s;ed, the Organs for &s;ecreting that Fluid being large enough to &s;upply all that is nece&s;|&s;ary o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> it in the common Functions of Life. 3<HI>dly,</HI> If the Fluid of the Nerves was to be thus kept in a perp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tual Circulation, it would &s;oon become too acrid for continuing with &s;afety in &s;uch &s;en&s;ible tender Ve&s;&s;els as the Brain and Nerves are compo&s;ed of. 4<HI>thly,</HI> This Hypo|the&s;is will not an&s;wer the De&s;ign for which it was propo&s;ed. For tho' the momentary Ap|plication of an Object might cau&s;e an Accele|ration in the Fluid of venous Nerves, yet if the Object was kept applied to the Nerves, it would &s;top their Fluid, &s;o that it could not go
<PB N="23" REF="26">forward to the Brain; and therefore, according to this Doctrine, we &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of no Objects, except tho&s;e who&s;e Application to the Organs of the Sen&s;es was momentary.</P>
<P N="48">48. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e it probable, that the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis</HI> &s;ecern a Li|quor from the Blood which is &s;ent into all the Nerves, and that by the Means of this Liquor the Nerves perform the Offices commonly a&s;|&s;igned to them, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enquire what Kind of Liquor this is, and how it moves, in order to determine how well its Nature and Motion are fitted for performing what is ex|pected from it.</P>
<P N="49">49. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Liquor of the Nerves was of a very &s;trong acid or alca|line Nature; but &s;ince we can &s;ee none of our Juices of &s;uch Natures, and &s;ince &s;uch Liquors irritate and de&s;troy the Parts of the Body they are applied to, we can never imagine that the Brain could &s;eparate, or the Nerves could bear any Thing of &s;uch an acrid Nature; and this &s;ame Tenderne&s;s and Sen&s;ibility of the&s;e Or|gans mu&s;t hinder us to &s;uppo&s;e the Liquor of the Nerves can be acrid or pungent of any Kind, as of the Nature of inflammable Spirits, Spirit of Harthorn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="50">50. Some have imagined the Liquor of the Nerves to be capable of va&s;t Explo&s;ion, like Gunpowder, or of violent &s;udden Raretaction like Air, or of &s;trong Ebullition like boiling Water, or the Mixture of Acids with alkaline Liquors. But as none of the Particles of our Ma&s;s of Blood, from which this Liquor of the Nerves mu&s;t be derived, enjoy any &s;uch Pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">erties, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the Blood to fur|ni&s;h
<PB N="24" REF="27">what it has not. Be&s;ides, all the&s;e Ope|rations are too violent for the Brain or Nerves to bear; and when once they are begun, are not &s;o quickly controuled or put an End to, as Experience teaches us the Nerves can be made to cea&s;e from acting.</P>
<P N="51">51. We know not &s;ufficiently the Properties of an <HI>Aether</HI> pervading every Thing, to pretend to apply it to the animal Functions, e&s;pecially where we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it &s;ent a great Way in a long Cord, in which we cannot conceive how it &s;hould be confined; which are Difficul|ties not to be &s;urmounted in accounting for the Functions of Nerves by Means of &s;uch an <HI>Ae|ther.</HI></P>
<P N="52">52. The &s;ure&s;t Way of judging what Kind of Liquor this of the Nerves mu&s;t be, is to ex|mine the Liquors of &s;imilar Parts of the Body. All the Glands &s;eparate Liquors from the Blood much thinner than the compound Ma&s;s it&s;elf; &s;uch is the <HI>Liquor</HI> poured into the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen, Thorax, Ventricles of the Brain,</HI> the <HI>Saliva, pancreatic Juice, Lymph,</HI> &amp;c. Where|ever there is Occa&s;ion for &s;ecreted Liquors being thick and vi&s;cid, in order to an&s;wer bet|ter the U&s;es they are intended for, Nature has provided Re&s;ervoirs for them to &s;tagnate in, where their thinner Parts may be carried off by the numerous ab&s;orbent Veins di&s;per&s;ed on the Sides of tho&s;e Cavities, or by flying off where there is a Communication with the ex|ternal Air. The <HI>Snot of the No&s;e</HI> is very thick commonly by &s;tagnating; but when the Se|cretion of the Membrane of the No&s;e is in crea&s;ed by blowing the No&s;e, or by Sternuta|tories, we &s;ee it very thin and watry; there
<PB N="25" REF="28">not then Time for the Air or Ab&s;orbents to carry off the more watry Particles. The <HI>Ce|rumen</HI> of the Ears is of a watry Con&s;i&s;tence, when &s;queezed out before it has &s;tagnated. The <HI>Mucus</HI> of the alimentary Canal is con|cocted in <HI>Lacunae.</HI> The <HI>Bile</HI> in the hepatick Duct is lymphatick; that in the Gall-bladder is vi&s;cid and &s;trong.

The <HI>Seed</HI> is thin as it comes from the Te&s;ticles, and is concocted in the <HI>Ve&s;iculae &s;eminales, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="53">53. From &sect; 52. we may &s;afely conclude, that the Secretion of a thing Liquor is made in the <HI>Cortex</HI> of the <HI>Encephalon</HI> and <HI>Medulla &s;pi|nalis;</HI> and &s;eeing the Thinne&s;s of &s;ecreted Li|quors is generally as the Divi&s;ions of the Ve&s;|&s;els into &s;mall &s;ubtile Branches, and the Ra|mifications within the Skull are carried on to a very great Subtilty, the Liquor &s;ecreted in the <HI>Encephalon</HI> may be determined to be among the fine&s;t or thinne&s;t Fluids.</P>
<P N="54">54. Seeing we can ob&s;erve no large Re&s;er|voire, where the Liquor &s;ecerned in the <HI>corti|cal Sub&s;tance</HI> is depo&s;ited, to have its finer Parts taken off, we have Rea&s;on to think, that it goes forward into the Nerves in the &s;ame Con|dition in which it is &s;ecerned.</P>
<P N="55">55. By fine or &s;ubtile animal Liquors is meant no more than tho&s;e which are very flu|id, con&s;i&s;ting of a large Proportion of watry Particles, and a le&s;&s;er one of the oily, &s;aline and terre&s;trious Particles.

<P>If then the&s;e Liquors, which are &s;ubject to our Examination, the &s;ecerning Ve&s;&s;els of which are &s;o large that we can &s;ee them, have &s;uch a &s;mall Cohe&s;ion of Farts, it might not be unrea&s;onable to &s;ay, that the Li|quor of the Nerves is as much more fine and fluid than Lymph, as the Ve&s;&s;els &s;eparating it are &s;maller; and therefore that the Fluid of the Nerves is a defecated Water with a very &s;mall Proportion of <HI>animal Sapo</HI> di&s;&s;olved in it.</P>
<P N="56">56. Two Experiments are &s;aid to contra|dict this Opinion of the Liquor of the Nerves being &s;o fluid and &s;ubtile. One is, that upon cutting the <HI>Cauda equina</HI> of a living Anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">l, a Liquor as vi&s;cid as the White of an Egg drops out: The other is, that a wounded Nerve yields a <HI>glairy Sanies.</HI> But the&s;e are no Proof that the Liquor of the Nerves is of the &s;ame Nature, &s;ince it is evident that the Liquor di&s;|charged in both tho&s;e Ca&s;es, comes out of the cellular Sub&s;tance involving the nervous Fi|brils.</P>
<P N="57">57. Con&s;idering how many Experiments make it evident, that there is a con&s;tant uninter|rupted Stream of Liquors flowing through all the Canals of Animals, which convey Li|quors, who&s;e Particles are not larger than the Diameter of their Canal, which never is the Ca&s;e in a natural State of excretory Ve&s;&s;els, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;urprizing how the Opinion ever &s;hould have

The Nerves, as well as the other Excretories of the Glands are always full of Liquors, the Degree of Di&s;ten&s;ion of the Canals by the Liquors being, even in a &s;ound natural State, &s;ometimes more and &s;ome|times le&s;s, the Sides of the Tubes being &s;tret|ched to make way for a larger Quantity, and contracting to accommodate them&s;elves to a le&s;&s;er Quantity; as much Liquor as does Vio|lence to the Sides of the Canals in &s;tretching, or &s;o little as the Sides cannot contract to, both occa&s;ion Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="58">58. The Motion of the Fluid in the Nerves will not only then be con&s;tant, but it will al&s;o be equal, or nearly &s;o: For tho' the Blood in the larger Arteries is moved unequally by the unequal Forces, the Contraction of the Ven|tricle of the Heart, and the weaker Power, the Sy&s;tole of the Arteries, yet the Difference between the&s;e two moving Powers comes to be le&s;s and le&s;s perceptible, as the Arteries divide into &s;maller Branches, becau&s;e of the nume|rous Re&s;i&s;tances the Liquors meet with, and becau&s;e the Canals they move in become larger, till in the very &s;mall arterious Branches there is no Difference in the Velocity of the Liquors from the Effect of the Heart or Arte|rie. The Motion of the Fluids mu&s;t &s;till be more equal in the Excretories of Glands,
<PB N="28" REF="31">and particularly in tho&s;e where the Ve&s;&s;els have divided into very minute Branches. So that the nervous Fluid will move con&s;tantly, equal|ly and &s;lowly for ordinary; but this natural Cour&s;e may be alter'd by the Influence of the Mind, or by the Pre&s;&s;ure of &s;ome neighbour|ing active Organ.</P>
<P N="59">59. We have perhaps no Idea of the Man|ner how Mind and Body act upon each other; but if we allow that the one is affected by the other, and that the Fluid of the Nerves (what|ever Name People plea&s;e to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t) is a prin|cipal In&s;trument which the Mind makes u&s;e of to influence the Actions of the Body, or to inform it&s;elf of the Impre&s;&s;ions made on the Body, we mu&s;t allow that the Mind can di|rect this In&s;trument differently, particularly as to Quantity and Celerity.</P>

<P>In general we may well enough &s;ay, that Nerves can carry Fluids to the mo&s;t minute Part of the Body, to &s;upply what is wa&s;ted in any of the &s;olids; that the Impre&s;&s;ion made by the Objects of the Sen&s;es on the very &s;oft pul|py

<P N="61">61.

<P N="63">63. <HI>a.</HI> All Objects of our Sen&s;es act by Im|pul&s;e, when they are applied to their proper Organs. Tangible Objects evidently pre&s;s on the Surface of our Bodies: Odorous Particles need the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Air moved rapidly to affect our No&s;e: Sapid Sub&s;tances often are not &s;ufficient to give us any Idea of their Ta&s;te by their own Weight, but need the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Tongue upon the Palate: The Rays of Light collected into a <HI>Focus</HI> drive light Bodies before them: Sound communi|cates a Vibration to all Bodies in harmonic Proportion with it. The Impul&s;e made thus by any of the&s;e Objects on the &s;oft pulpy Nerves (&sect; 20.) which are full of Liquor, will pre&s;s their Sides or Extremities, and their Li|quor

Thus, for Example, Light is the proper Object to be applied to the Eye, to give us any Idea of Colours; yet when all Light is excluded from the Eyes, an Idea of Light and Colours may be excited in us by Coughing, Sneezing, Rubbing, or &s;triking the Eye-ball.&mdash; A Cane vibrating by a Stroke, but not &s;o as to give any Sound perceptible to the Ear, if it is applied to the Teeth, it rai&s;es a &s;trong Idea of Sound, as will al&s;o a little In|&s;ect crawling in the <HI>Meatus auditorius.</HI>&mdash;The Fingers applied to two rough Surfaces, rub|bing on each other, are &s;en&s;ible of the Sound they make; Surgeons of any Practice in the Cure of fractured Bones can bear Witne&s;s to the Truth of this.&mdash; The Fingers dipped in acid and &s;everal other acrid Liquors, have a Sen&s;ation very like to Ta&s;ting.&mdash; Sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lling and Ta&s;ting every Body knows are &s;ub&s;ervien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to each other.

<P N="h"><HI>h.</HI> If the Application of Objects is too vio|lent, and there is any Danger of the tender Organs of our Sen&s;es being le&s;ed or de&s;troyed, the unea&s;y Sen&s;ation we call <HI>Pain</HI> is rai&s;ed, whatever the Organ thus le&s;ed is.

<P N="i"><HI>i.</HI> Whenever this unea&s;y Sen&s;ation, <HI>Pain,</HI> is thus rai&s;ed, a Sort of Nece&s;&s;ity is as it were impo&s;ed upon the Mind, to endeavour to get free of the injuring Cau&s;e, by either withdraw|ing

<P>This <HI>Ni&s;us</HI> of the Mind to free the Body of what is in Danger of being very hurtful, may &s;erve to explain the Phaenomena of a great many Di&s;ea&s;es, when we are acquainted with the Di&s;tribution of the part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">cular Nerves; and from this we can under&s;tand the Operation of Medicines that &s;timulate, and may learn how by exciting a &s;harp but momentary Pain, we may free the Body of another Pain that would be more durable; and that by having it thus in our Power to determine a flow of the Liquor of the Nerves to any particular Part, for the Benefit of that Part or the Relief of any other di&s;ea&s;ed Part, we can do con&s;iderable Ser|vice by a right Application of the proper Me|dicines.</P>
<P N="k"><HI>k.</HI> If a Pain-giving Cau&s;e is very violent or long continued, it de&s;troys the Organs either irrecoverably, or puts them &s;o much out of Order, that they only gradually recover.

<P N="64">64. 1.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4. Another Objection to the Action of Mu&s;cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s being owing to the Influx of a Fluid into their Fibrils is, that mu&s;cular Fibres are di&s;tractile, or capable or being &s;tretched; and therefore when a Fluid is poured into their hollow Fibrils, they would be &s;tretched longi|tudinally, as well as have their tran&s;ver&s;e Dia|meters increa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d, that is, a Mu&s;cle would be|come longer as well as thicker when it is put in Action, whereas it is known to every Body that a Mu&s;cle is &s;hortned when acting.</P>

<P N="6">6. If mu&s;cular Motion depends on the In|flux of the nervous Liquid, the in&s;tantaneous Contraction of a Mu&s;cle, when the Mind wills to make it act, will ea&s;ily be under&s;tood from the Nerves being always full of their Liquor, (&sect; 57.)</P>

<HEAD>Of the particular Nerves.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are generally &s;aid to be forty Pair of Nerves in all, of which ten come out from the <HI>Encephalon,</HI> and the other thirty have their Origin from the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis.</HI></P>
<P>Of the ten Pair of Nerves that are generally &s;aid to come from the <HI>Encephalon,</HI> the fir&s;t is the <HI>OLFACTORY,</HI> which long had the Name of the <HI>Mammillary Proce&s;&s;es</HI> of the Brain, be|cau&s;e in the Brutes which were mo&s;t com|monly di&s;&s;ected, their Form has &s;ome Re&s;em|blance to a Nipple; for they are large where they begin to go out from the Brain, and taper a little as they go forwards to the cribriform Part of the <HI>Ethmoid</HI> Bone; and becau&s;e in the&s;e Animals they are evidently Continuations or Productions of the two anterior Ventricles of the Brain, being hollow and contain|ing Lymph, the Antients believed that the&s;e Nerves &s;erved to convey the &s;uperfluous <HI>Mucus</HI> from the cold moi&s;t Brain, to be evacuated by the Holes of the cribriform Bone into the No&s;e. But in Man the&s;e Nerves are &s;mall, long, and without any Cavity, having their Origin from the <HI>corpora &s;triata,</HI> near the Part where the internal carotid Arteries are about to &s;end off their Branches to the different Parts of the Brain, and in their Cour&s;e under the an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">erior Lobes of the Brain, which have a De|pre&s;&s;ion made for lodging them, the human olfactory Nerves become larger till they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ome to the cribriform Bone where they &s;plit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nto a great Number of &s;mall Filaments to pa&s;s thro' the little Holes in that Bone, and
<PB N="40" REF="43">then each being joined by a Franch of the fifth Pair of Nerves is &s;pread on the Membrane of the No&s;e.</P>
<P>The tender Structure and &s;udden Expan&s;ion of the&s;e Nerves on &s;uch a large Surface ren|der it impo&s;&s;ible to trace them far; which has made &s;ome Authors deny them to be Nerves: But when we break the Circumference of the <HI>cribriform Lamella,</HI> and then gently rai&s;e it, we may &s;ee the Di&s;tribution of the Nerves &s;ome way on the Membrane of the No&s;e.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of defending the&s;e long &s;oft Nerves from being too much pre&s;&s;ed by the anterior Lobes of the Brain under which they lye, is &s;ingular, becau&s;e they have not only the prominent orbitar Proce&s;&s;es of the frontal Bone, and the <HI>Cri&s;ta Galli</HI> of the <HI>Eth|moid</HI> Bone to &s;upport the Brain on each Side, with the <HI>Falx</HI> by means of the Veins going in|to the longitudinal Sinus, and other Attach|ments bearing it up in the Middle, but have a Groove formed in each Lobe of the Brain it&s;elf for them to lodge in. Their &s;plitting into &s;o many &s;mall Branches before they enter the Bones of the Skull is likewi&s;e peculiar to them; for generally the Nerves come from the Brain in di&s;gregated Filaments, and unite into Cords, as they are going out at the Holes of the Bones: But we &s;hall find that this Con|trivance is the be&s;t for an&s;wering the Purpo&s;e they are de&s;igned for, of being the Organ of &s;melling; for had they been expanded upon the Membrane of the No&s;e into a medullary Web, &s;uch as the optic Nerve forms, it would have been too &s;en&s;ible to bear the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch Objects as are applied to it,
<PB N="41" REF="44">and a Di&s;tribution in the more common way of a Cord &s;ending off Branches, would not have been equal enough for &s;uch an Organ of Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The 2<HI>d</HI> Pair of Nerves are the <HI>OPTIC,</HI> which ri&s;e each from the <HI>thalami nervorum op|ticorum,</HI> and then after making a large Curve outwards, run obliquely inwards and for|wards till they unite at the Fore-part of the <HI>Sella Turcica,</HI> and then dividing again, each runs obliquely forwards and outwards to go out at its proper Hole in the &s;phenoid Bone, accompanied with the proper ocular Artery, to run afterwards to the Globe of the Eye, within which each is extended into a very fine Cup-like Web that lines all the In-&s;ide of the Eye as far forwards as the <HI>ciliary Circle,</HI> and is univer&s;ally known by the Name of <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the Sub&s;tance of the&s;e two Nerves &s;eems to be blended at the Place where they are joined, yet Ob&s;ervations of People who&s;e optic Nerves were not joined at all, and of others who have been blind of one Eye from a Fault in the optic Nerve, or in tho&s;e who have had one of their Eyes taken out, make it appear that there is no &s;uch intimate Union of Sub&s;tance, the optic Nerve of the affected Side only being w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted, while the other was large and plump; and the &s;ame Ob&s;ervations are contradictory to the Doctrine of a Decu&s;|&s;ation of all the Nerves (&sect; 7.); for the Di&s;ea&s;e could be traced from the affected Eye to the Origin of the Nerve on the &s;ame Side. In many Fi&s;hes indeed the Doctrine of Decu&s;&s;a|tion is favoured, for their optic Nerves plain|ly
<PB N="42" REF="45">cro&s;s each other without any Union at the Part where they are joined in Men and mo&s;t Quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People, who&s;e optic Nerves were not joined, having neither &s;een Objects double, nor turned their Eyes different Ways, is al&s;o a plain Proof that the Conjunction of the op|tic Nerves will not &s;erve to account for either the uniform Motions of our Eyes, or our &s;eeing Objects &s;ingle with two Eyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Retina</HI> of a recent Eye, without any Preparation, appears a very fine Web, with &s;ome Blood-ve&s;&s;els coming from its Center to be di&s;tributed on it; but after a good In|jection of the Arteries that run in the Sub|&s;tance of this Nerve as is common to o|ther Nerves, it is with Difficulty that we can ob&s;erve its nervous medullary Sub&s;tance. As the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are placed in the centrical Part of the optic Nerve, and there are not medul|lary Fibres here, where it enters the Ball of the Eye: This may be one Rea&s;on why we do not &s;ee &s;uch Bodies or Parts of Bodies, who&s;e Picture, formed on the Bottom of our Eye, falls on this centrical Part of the <HI>Retina.</HI> An In|flammation in tho&s;e Arteries of the <HI>Retina,</HI> which an <HI>Opthalmia</HI> is generally attended with, may very well account for that Tenderne&s;s in the Eyes, and Inability to bear the Light which People have in that Di&s;ea&s;e. The Over-di&s;|ten&s;ion of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els may likewi&s;e &s;erve to account for the black Spots ob&s;erved on bright coloured Bodies e&s;pecially, and that &s;moaky Fog, thro' which all Objects are &s;een by People in &s;ome Fevers. If tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els lo&s;e their Tone and remain preternaturaly di&s;tended, no
<PB N="43" REF="46">Objects may affect our <HI>Retina,</HI> tho' the Eye externally appears &s;ound, or this may be one Cau&s;e of an <HI>Amauro&s;is</HI> or <HI>Gutta &s;erena.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>THIRD PAIR</HI> ri&s;e from the anterior Part of the <HI>Proce&s;&s;us annularis,</HI> and piercing the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> a little before and to a Side of the lateral Extrem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ties of the po&s;terior clinoid Proce&s;s of the &s;phenoid Bone, run along the <HI>Receptacula,</HI> or <HI>cavernous Sinu&s;es,</HI> at the Side of the <HI>Ephippium,</HI> to get out at the <HI>Foramina lace|ra,</HI> to be di&s;tributed to the Globe of the Eye, to the <HI>Mu&s;culus rectus</HI> of the <HI>Palpebra,</HI> and to the <HI>Attollens, Adductor, Deprimens</HI> and <HI>obli|quus minor</HI> Mu&s;cles of the Eye-ball. The&s;e Mu&s;cles being principal In&s;truments in the Motions of the Eye-lid and Eye-ball, the Nerve has therefore got the Name of the <HI>Mo|tor Oculi.</HI> I have frequently ob&s;erved in Con|vul&s;ions the Eye-lids widely opened, the <HI>Cor|nea</HI> turned up and outwards, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e Eye-balls &s;unk in the Orbit; which well de&s;cribed the conjunct Action of the Mu&s;cles which this Pair of Nerves &s;erves. Po&s;&s;ibly the Di&s;ten&s;ion of a con&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">erable Branch of the Carotid, which pa&s;&s;es over this Nerve near its Origin on each Side, may be the Rea&s;on of that Heavine&s;s in the Eye-lids and Eyes, after drinking hard or eating much.</P>
<P>The <HI>FOURTH PAIR,</HI> which are the &s;mal|le&s;t Nerves of any, derive their Origin from the po&s;terior Ba&s;e of the <HI>Te&s;tes,</HI> and then mak|ing a long Cour&s;e on the Side of the annular Protuberance, enter the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> a little farther back and outwards than the third Pair, to run al&s;o along the <HI>Receptacula,</HI> to pa&s;s out at the <HI>Foramina lacera,</HI> and to be entirely &s;pent
<PB N="44" REF="47">on the <HI>Mu&s;culi trochleares,</HI> or &s;uperior oblique Mu&s;cles of the Eyes. The rotatory Motions and the Advancement of the Eye-balls forward, by which Motions &s;everal of our Pa&s;&s;ions are expre&s;&s;ed, principally depending on the&s;e Mu&s;|cles, the Nerves that &s;erve them have got the Name of <HI>PATHETICI.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>FIFTH PAIR</HI> are large Nerves, ri|&s;ing from the annular Proce&s;s, where the me|dullary Proce&s;&s;es of the <HI>Cerebellum</HI> join in the Formation of that <HI>Tuber,</HI> to enter the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> near the Point of the petrous Proce&s;s of the Temporal Bones, and then plunging into the <HI>Receptacula</HI> at the Side of the <HI>Sella Turcica,</HI> each becomes in appearance thicker, and goes out of the Skull in three great Branches.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Branch of the 5th is the <HI>O|PHTHALMICK,</HI> which runs through the <HI>Foramen lacerum</HI> to the Orbit, having in its Pa&s;|&s;age thither a Connection with the 6th Pair: it is afterwards di&s;tributed to the Ball of the Eye with the 3d, to the No&s;e, along with the Ol|factory, which the Branch of the 5th that pa&s;&s;es through the <HI>Orbiter internus</HI> Hole, joins in the Manner already mentioned in the De&s;cription of the fir&s;t Pair. This ophthalmic Branch like|wi&s;e &s;upplies the <HI>Glandula lacrymalis,</HI> Fat, Membranes, Mu&s;cles and the Teguments of the Eye-lids, its longe&s;t farthe&s;t extended Branch pa&s;&s;ing through the <HI>Foramen &s;uperciliare</HI> of the <HI>Os Frontis</HI> to be di&s;tributed to the Forehead.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Fibres which this fir&s;t Branch of the 5th and the third Pair of Nerves &s;end to the Eye-ball, being &s;ituated on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">optic Nerve, and after piercing the &s;clerotick Coat running on the choroid Coat on the Out&s;ide of the <HI>Re|tina</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="48">in their Cour&s;e to the <HI>Uvea</HI> or <HI>Iris,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be a Rea&s;on, why there is &s;uch a Sym|pathy between the optic Nerve and the <HI>Uvea,</HI> that the <HI>Uvea</HI> contracts to le&s;&s;en the Pupil, and exclude too numerous Rays of Light; and this, with the Sympathy which mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome of the Nerves of the Membrane of the No&s;trils being derived from this fir&s;t Branch of the 5th Pair of Nerves, may al&s;o be the Cau&s;e, why a &s;trong Irritation of too &s;trong Light up|on the <HI>Retina</HI> may produce the &s;ame Effect, Sneezing, as when any tickling Sub&s;tance is applied to the Membrane of the No&s;e. In the Megrim all the Branches of this Nerve di&s;co|ver them&s;elves to be affected; for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e Forehead is racked with Pain, the Eye-ball is pain'd, and feels as if it was &s;queezed, the Eye-lids &s;hut convul&s;ively, the Tears trickle down, and an unea&s;y Heat is felt in the No&s;e Hence we can under&s;tand, where external Medicines will have the be&s;t Effect, when applied to re|move this Di&s;ea&s;e, to wit, to the Membrane of the No&s;e and to the Forehead. Hence we can under&s;tand, why alternate Pre&s;&s;ure near the &s;uperciliary Hole of the frontal Bone &s;ome|times gives immediate Relief in the Megrim.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Branch of the 5th Pair of Nerves may be called <HI>MAXILLARIS SU|PERIOR,</HI> from its &s;erving principally the Parts of the upper Jaw. It goes out at the round Hole of the &s;phenoid Bone, and &s;ends immediately one Branch in the Channel on the Pop of the <HI>Antrum maxillare,</HI> the Membrane of which and the &s;uperior Teeth are &s;upplied by it in its Pa&s;&s;age. As it is about to go out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t the <HI>Orbiter externus</HI> Hole, it &s;ends a Nerve
<PB N="46" REF="49">through the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Os maxillare,</HI> to come out at <HI>Steno</HI>'s Duct, to be di&s;tributed to the anterior Part of the Palate; and what re|mains of it e&s;caping at the <HI>Orbiter externus</HI> Hole, divides into a great many Branches, that &s;upply the Cheek, upper Lip and No&s;tril. The next con&s;iderable Branch of the &s;uperior maxillary Nerve is &s;ent into the No&s;e by the Hole common to the Palate and &s;phenoidal Bone, and the remaining Part of this Nerve runs in the <HI>Palato-maxillaris</HI> Canal, giving off Branches to the Temples and Pterygoid Mu&s;|cles, and comes at la&s;t into the Palate to be lo&s;t. Hence the Ach in the Teeth of the up|per Jaw occa&s;ions a gnawing Pain deep &s;eated in the Bones of the Face, with a Swelling in the Eye-lids, Cheek, No&s;e and upper Lip; and on the other hand, an Inflammation in the&s;e Parts is often attended with &s;harp Pain in the Teeth. Hence an Ob&s;truction in the Duct of the maxillary Sinus, which obliges the Liquor &s;ecreted there to find out a preter|natural Rout for it&s;elf, as I have &s;een more than once, may be occa&s;ioned by the Pain of the Teeth.</P>
<P>The third or <HI>MAXILLARIS INFERIOR.</HI> Branch of the fifth Pair going out at the oval Hole of the &s;phenoid Bone, &s;erves the Mu&s;cles of the lower Jaw, and the Mu&s;cles &s;ituated between the <HI>Os hyoides</HI> and <HI>Jaw;</HI> all the &s;ali|vary Glands, the <HI>Amygdalae</HI> and the external Ear have Branches from it; it has a large Branch lo&s;t in the Tongue, and &s;ends another through the Canal in the Sub&s;tance of the low|er Jaw, to &s;erve all the Teeth there, and to come out at the Hole in the anterior Part of
<PB N="47" REF="50">the Jaw, to be lo&s;t in the Chin and Under-lip-Hence a convul&s;ive Contraction of the Mu&s;|cles of the lower Jaw, or the Mouth's being involuntarly &s;hut, a great Flow of Spittle or Salivation, a Pain in the Ear e&s;pecially in De|glutition, and a Swelling all about the Throat, are natural Con&s;equences of a violent Irritation of the Nerves of the lower Teeth in the Tooth-ach; and Pain in the Teeth and Ear is as natural a Con&s;equence of an <HI>Angina.</HI> Hence alternate Pre&s;&s;ure on the Chin may &s;ometimes relieve the Violence of a Tooth-ach. Hence de&s;troying the Nerves of a Tooth by actual or potential Cauteries, or pulling a carious Tooth, &s;o often removes immedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tely all the&s;e Symptoms. Hence no Cure is to be found for &s;ome Ulcers in the upper or lower Jaw, but by drawing a Tooth.</P>
<P>The <HI>SIXTH PAIR,</HI> which is the &s;malle&s;t except the fourth, ri&s;es from the Forepart of the <HI>Corpora pyramidalia,</HI> and entring the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> &s;ome way behind the Extremities of the po&s;terior clinoid Proce&s;&s;es of the &s;phenoid Bone, have a long Cour&s;e below that Membrane, and within the <HI>Receptacula</HI> at the Side of the <HI>Sella Turcica,</HI> to go out at the <HI>Foramina lacera</HI> into the Orbit, tolbe lo&s;t in the Abductor-mu&s;cle of the Eye. In this Pa&s;&s;age each of them lies very contiguous to the internal carotid Artery, and to the ophthalmick Branch of the fifth Pair of Nerves. At the &s;ame Place where they are contiguous to the Carotid, a Nerve, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">er, ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ording to the general De&s;cription of Anato|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ts, goe from each of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n an uncom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">on w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y (th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t is the Angle is obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e beyond <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> ri&s;es) to de&s;cend with the Artery, and
<PB N="48" REF="51">to form the Beginning of the <HI>interco&s;tal</HI> Nerve; or, according to other Authors, this Nerve comes up from the great <HI>Ganglion</HI> of the <HI>Inter|co&s;tal</HI> to be joined to the &s;ixth here.</P>
<P>The Arguments for this latter Opinion are, That according to the common Opinion, this Beginning of the <HI>interco&s;tal</HI> Nerve, as 'tis cal|led, would ri&s;e in a Manner not &s;o ordinary in Nerves. In the next Place it is ob&s;erved, that the &s;ixth Pair is larger nearer to the Orbit, than it is before it comes to the Place where this Nerve is &s;aid to go off; and therefore it is more probable, that it receives an Addition there rather than gives off a Branch. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> It is found, that upon cutting the <HI>interco&s;tal</HI> Nerves of living Animals, the Eyes plainly were affected, they lo&s;t their bright Water, the Gum, or Gore, as we call it, was &s;eparated in greater Quantity, the Pupil was more contra|cted, the cartilaginous Membrane at the inter|nal Canthus came more over the Eye, and the Eye-ball it&s;elf was dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>To this it is an&s;wered in Defence of the more common Doctrine, that other Branches of Nerves go off in a reflected Way as well as this does, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the Beginning of the Interco&s;tal, and that the Reflection would rather be greater, if it is thought to come up from the Interco&s;tal to the &s;ixth. <HI>2<HI>dly,</HI></HI> Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nerves enlarge &s;ometimes where there is no Addition made to them, as in the In&s;tance al+ready mentioned of the Trunk of the fifth Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> while below the <HI>Dura Mater. 3<HI>dly,</HI></HI> That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Experiments on living Animals &s;hew indeed that the Eyes are affected upon cutting the in|terco&s;tal Nerve, but not in the Way mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">

So that the Arguments are &s;till e|quivocal, and more Ob&s;ervations and Experi|ments mu&s;t be made before it can be determined with Certainty, whether the &s;ixth Pair gives or receives a Branch here. In the mean time I &s;hall continue to &s;peak about the Origin of the <HI>Interco&s;tal</HI> with the common Herd of Anato|mi&s;ts.</P>
<P>At this &s;ame Place where the Interco&s;tal be|gins, the fifth Pair is contiguous and adherent to the &s;ixth; and it is generally &s;aid, that the ophthalmic Branch of the fifth gives a Branch or two to the Beginning of the Interco&s;tal, or receives &s;uch from it. Others deny any &s;uch Communication between them, and tho&s;e who affirm the Communication confe&s;s, that in &s;ome Subjects they could not &s;ee it. After examining the Nerves here in a great many Subjects, I cannot determine whether or not there are nervous Filaments going from the one to the other. Sometimes I thought I traced them evidently; at other times I ob|&s;erved what I di&s;&s;ected for nervous Filaments, to be no other than collap&s;ed cellular Sub|&s;tance; and in all the Subjects where I had pu&s;hed an Injection &s;ucce&s;sfully into the very &s;mall Arteries, I could only ob&s;erve a <HI>Plexus</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="53">of Ve&s;&s;els connecting the one to the other. In any of the&s;e Ways however there is as much Connection, as we are a&s;&s;ured from many Ex|periments and Ob&s;ervations on other Nerves, is &s;ufficient to make a very great Sympathy among the Nerves here. Po&s;&s;ibly the Appear|ances in the Eyes of Dogs, who&s;e interco&s;tal Nerves were cut, might be owing to this Sym|pathy.</P>
<P>The <HI>SEVENTH PAIR</HI> comes out from the lateral Part of the <HI>annular Proce&s;s,</HI> behind where the medullary Proce&s;&s;es of the <HI>Cerebel|lum</HI> are joined to that <HI>Tuber,</HI> and, being ac|companied w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">th a larger Artery than mo&s;t o|ther Nerves, enters the <HI>internal Meatus audi|torius,</HI> where &s;oon the two great Pacquets of Fibr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s, of which it appeared to con&s;i&s;t within the Skull, &s;eparate from each other; one of them enters by &s;everal &s;mall Holes into the <HI>Ve&s;tible, Cochlea</HI> and <HI>&s;emicircular Canals,</HI> is &s;tretched on this inner <HI>Camera</HI> of the Ear in a very &s;oft pulpy Sub&s;tance; and being never &s;een in the Form of a firm Cord, &s;uch as the other Packet of this Nerve and mo&s;t other Nerves become, is called <HI>PORTIO MOL|LIS</HI> of the auditory Nerve.</P>
<P>The other Part of this &s;eventh Pair pa&s;&s;es through <HI>Galen's Foramen caecum</HI> or <HI>Fallopius's Aqueduct</HI> in its crooked Pa&s;&s;age by the Side of the <HI>Tympanum,</HI> in which Pa&s;&s;age a Nerve &s;ent from the lingual Branch of the inferior maxil|lary Nerve, along the out&s;ide of the <HI>Tuba Eu|&s;tachiana,</HI> and cro&s;s the Cavity of the <HI>Tympa|num,</HI> where it has the Name of <HI>Chorda Tym|pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s commonly &s;aid to be joined to it. The very acute Angle which this Nerve makes with
<PB N="51" REF="54">the fifth, or the &s;udden violent Reflexion it would &s;uffer, on the Suppo&s;ition of its coming from the fifth to the &s;eventh, whereas &s;uppo|&s;ing its Cour&s;e from the &s;eventh to the fifth, its Cour&s;e would be more in the ordinary Way, has made &s;ome &s;ay, that this <HI>Chorda tympani</HI> &s;hould be e&s;teemed a Branch of the &s;eventh Pair going to join the fifth. This &s;ame &s;maller Packet of the &s;eventh gives Branches to the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Malleus</HI> and to the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> while it pa&s;&s;es through the bony crook|ed Canal, and at la&s;t comes out in a firm Cord named <HI>PORTIO DURA,</HI> at the Extremity of this Canal, between the <HI>&s;tyloid</HI> and <HI>ma&s;toid</HI> Proce&s;&s;es of the temporal Bone, giving imme|diately Filaments to the little oblique Mu&s;cles of the Head, and to tho&s;e that ri&s;e from the &s;tyloid Proce&s;s. It then pierces through the parotid Gland, and divides into a great many Branches, which are di&s;per&s;ed in the Mu&s;cles and Teguments that cover all the Side of the &s;uperior Part of the Neck, the whole Face and <HI>Cranium,</HI> as far back as the Temples, in|cluding a con&s;iderable Part of the external Ear. Its Branches having thus a con&s;iderable Con|nection with all the three Branches of the fifth Pair, and with the &s;econd cervical, occa&s;ions a con&s;iderable Sympathy of the&s;e Nerves with it. Hence in the Tooth-ach, the Pain is &s;ome|times very little in the affected Tooth, com|pared to what it is all along the Side of the Head and in the Ear. Hence probably the Re|lief of the Tooth-ach by Bli&s;ters applied behind the Ear, or by a hot Iron touching the <HI>Antihe|lix</HI> of the Ear. By this Communication or Con|nexion po&s;&s;ibly too it is, that a vibrating String
<PB N="52" REF="55">held between one's Teeth, gives him a &s;trong Idea of its Sound which no other can hear. Perhaps too the Di&s;tribution of this Nerve oc|ca&s;ions the Head to be &s;o quickly turned upon the Impre&s;&s;ion of Sound on our Ears.</P>
<P>The <HI>EIGHTH PAIR</HI> of Nerves ri&s;e from the lateral Ba&s;e of the <HI>Corpora olivaria</HI> in di&s;|gregated Fibres, and as they are entring the anterior internal Part of the Hole, common to the <HI>Os Occipitis</HI> and <HI>Temporum,</HI> each is joined by a Nerve which a&s;cends within the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> from the 10th of the Head, the fir&s;t and &s;econd cervical, and &s;ometimes from inferior Nerves: This every Body knows has the Name of the <HI>NERVUS ACCESSORIUS.</HI> When the two get out of the Skull, the <HI>Acce&s;&s;orius</HI> &s;eparates from the eighth, and de&s;cending ob|liquely outwards, pa&s;&s;es through the <HI>Sterno|ma&s;toideus</HI> Mu&s;cle, to which it gives Branches to be lo&s;t in the <HI>Trapezius</HI> and <HI>Rhomboid</HI> Mu&s;|cles of the <HI>Scapula.</HI> In this Cour&s;e it is ge|nerally more or le&s;s joined by the &s;econd cer|vical Nerve.</P>
<P>The large <HI>eighth Pair</HI> &s;oon after its Exit gives Nerves to the Tongue, <HI>Larynx, Pha|rynx</HI> and <HI>Ganglion</HI> of the <HI>Interco&s;tal</HI> Nerve, and being disjoined from the 9th and Interco|&s;tal, to which it adheres clo&s;ely &s;ome way, runs &s;traight down the Neck behind the inter|nal jugular Vein, and at the interior Side of the internal carotid Artery. As it is about to enter the <HI>Thorax,</HI> a large Nerve goes off from the eighth of each Side: This branch of the right Side turns round from the anterior to the po&s;terior Part of the &s;ubclavian Artery, while the Branch of the left Side turns round the great
<PB N="53" REF="56">Curve of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> both of them mounting up again at the Side of the <HI>O E&s;ophagus,</HI> to which they give Branches, are lo&s;t at la&s;t in the <HI>La|rynx.</HI> The&s;e are called the <HI>RECURRENT</HI> Nerves, which we are de&s;ired to &s;hun in the Operation of <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> tho' their deep Si|tuation protects them &s;ufficiently. The Mu|&s;cles of the <HI>Larynx</HI> being in a good mea&s;ure &s;upplied with Nerves from the Recurrents, it is to be expected, that the cutting of them will greatly weaken the Voice, tho' it will not be entirely lo&s;t, &s;o long as the &s;uperior Branches of the eighth Pair are entire.</P>
<P>At or near the Place where the recurrent Nerves go off from the eighth Pair, or frequent|ly from the Recurrents them&s;elves, Nerves go off to the <HI>Pericardium,</HI> and to join with the Branches of the Interco&s;tal that are di&s;tributed to the Heart.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Branches are &s;ent off, the <HI>Par|vagum</HI> on each Side de&s;cends behind the great Branch of the <HI>Trachea</HI> and gives numerous Fi|laments to the Lungs in going to the <HI>O E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">opha|gus.</HI> The one of the left Side running on the Forepart of the <HI>O E&s;ophagus,</HI> communicates by &s;everal Branches with the right one in its De&s;cent to be di&s;tributed to the Stomach: The right one gets behind the <HI>O E&s;ophagus,</HI> where it &s;plits and rejoins &s;everal Times be|fore it arrives at the Stomach, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;ends Nerves; and then being joined by a Branch from the left Trunk, they run towards the caeliac Artery, there to join into the great <HI>&s;emi|lunar Ganglion</HI> formed by the two Interco&s;tals.</P>
<P>From the Di&s;tribution of this <HI>Par vagum,</HI> we may learn how tickling the <HI>Fauces</HI> with a
<PB N="54" REF="57">Feather or any &s;uch Sub&s;tance, excites a Nau|&s;ea and Inclination to vomit. Why cough|ing occa&s;ions vomiting, or vomiting rai&s;es a Cough. Hence we &s;ee how the nervous <HI>A&s;thma</HI> and the <HI>Tu&s;&s;is convul&s;iva,</HI> Kinkcough, are attended with a &s;traitning of the <HI>Glottis.</HI> How Food ill to dige&s;t brings on the <HI>A&s;thma</HI> on weakly People, and why <HI>Emetics</HI> have fre|quently cured the <HI>A&s;thma</HI> very &s;peedily. How the &s;uperior Orifice of the Stomach is &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble as to be looked on as the Seat of the Soul by &s;ome. How People &s;ubject to Di&s;ten&s;ions of the Stomach have &s;o often the Sen&s;ations of Balls in their Brea&s;t or Throats. Why the <HI>Globus hy&s;tericus</HI> is &s;o often attended with a violent Strangulation at the <HI>Glottis.</HI> The Sym|pathy among the Branches of the&s;e Nerves will lead us to under&s;tand the&s;e and &s;everal o|ther Phaenomena.</P>
<P>The <HI>NINTH PAIR</HI> of Nerves comes from the inferior Part of the <HI>Corpora pyramidalia,</HI> to go out of the Skull at their proper Holes of the occipital Bones. After their Egre&s;s they adhere for &s;ome way firmly to the 8th and Interco&s;tal, and then &s;ending a Branch that in many Subjects is joined with Branches of the fir&s;t and &s;econd cervical Nerves, to be di&s;tri|buted to the Thyroid Gland and Mu&s;cles on the Fore-part of the <HI>Trachea Arteria,</HI> the 9th is lo&s;t in the Mu&s;cles and Sub&s;tance of the Tongue. Some have thought this Nerve, and others have e&s;teemed the third Branch of the fifth Pair of Nerves to be the proper gu&s;tatory Nerve. I know no Ob&s;ervations or Experi|ments to prove either Opinion, or to deter|mine that both the Nerves may not &s;erve for
<PB N="55" REF="58">Ta&s;ting, and for the Motion of the Tongue.</P>
<P>The <HI>TENTH PAIR</HI> ri&s;es from the Sides of the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> to go out between the <HI>Os Occipitis</HI> and <HI>fir&s;t Vertebra</HI> of the Neck. After each of them gives a Branch to the great Ganglion of the Interco&s;tal Nerve, they are di&s;tributed to the oblique Mu&s;cles, and to &s;ome of the Exten&s;ors of the Head. Whether the Name of the tenth of the Head, or of the fir&s;t Vertebral, ought to be given to this Nerve, is of no &s;uch Con&s;equence as to de&s;erve a Debate.</P>
<P>In the De&s;cription of the &s;ixth Pair, I &s;aid that I would u&s;e the way of &s;peaking which mo&s;t Anatomi&s;ts have, to wit, I would &s;ay that the Beginning of the Interco&s;tal Nerve comes out of the Skull, and therefore &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ll here &s;ubjoin a cur&s;ory De&s;cription of this Nerve to tho&s;e of the Head, notwith&s;tand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ng its much larger Part is compo&s;ed of Nerves coming out from the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis.</HI> There is no greater Incongruity in Point of Method to &s;ay, that a Nerve one is de&s;cribing receives Additions from Nerves that have not been de|&s;cribed, than it is to repeat in the De&s;cription of a great many Nerves, that each of them gives Branches to form a Nerve which we are ignorant of, which is all the Difference be|tween de&s;cribing the Interco&s;tal before or after the &s;pinal Nerves.</P>
<P>The Branch reflected from the &s;ixth Pair, joined po&s;&s;ibly by &s;ome Filaments of the <HI>O|phthalmic</HI> Branch of the fifth, runs along with the internal Carotid thro' the crooked Canal formed for this Artery in the <HI>temporal Bone,</HI> where the little Nerve is very &s;oft and pappy,
<PB N="56" REF="59">and in &s;everal Subjects divides and unites a|gain before it comes out of the Skull. As soon as the Nerve e&s;capes out of this bony Ca|nal it is connected a little way with the eighth and ninth, then &s;eparating from them, after &s;eeming to receive additional Nerves from them, it forms a <HI>large Ganglion,</HI> into which Branches from the tenth of the Head, and from the fir&s;t and &s;econd cervical enter. From this Ganglion the Nerves come out again &s;mall to run down the Neck along with the carotid Artery, communicating by Branches with the cervical Nerves, and giv|ing Nerves to the Mu&s;cles that bend the Head and Neck. As the <HI>Interco&s;tal</HI> is about to en|ter the <HI>Thorax,</HI> it forms another Ganglion from which Nerves are &s;ent to the Trachea and to the Heart; the&s;e de&s;igned for the Heart joining with the Branches of the eighth, and pa&s;&s;ing between the two great Arteries and the Auricles to the Sub&s;tance of that Mu&s;cle. The Interco&s;tal after this being compo&s;ed of two Branches, one going behind, and the o|ther running over the anterior Part of the Sub|clavian Artery, forms a new Ganglion where the two Branches unite below that Artery, and then de&s;cending along the Sides of the <HI>Verte|brae</HI> of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> receives Branches from each of the dor&s;al Nerves, which Branches appearing to come out between the Ribs, have given the Name of Interco&s;tal to the whole Nerve. Where the Addition is made to it from the fifth dor&s;al Nerve, a Branch goes off ob|liquely forwards, which being joined by other &s;uch Branches from the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, eighth and ninth dar&s;al, an anterior Trunk is form|ed
<PB N="57" REF="60">that pa&s;&s;es between the Fibres of the <HI>Ap|pendix mu&s;culo&s;a</HI> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Diaphragm to form a|long with the other Interco&s;tal and the Branches of the eighth Pair, a large &s;emilunar Ganglion &s;ituated betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">n the caeliac and &s;uperior me|&s;enteric Arteries; the Roots of which are, as it were, involved in a &s;ort of nervous Net|work of this Ganglion, from which a great Number of very &s;mall nervous Threads run out to be extended on the Surface of all the Branches of the&s;e two Arteries, &s;o as to be ea&s;ily &s;een when any of the Arteries are &s;tretch|ed, but not to be di&s;&s;ected off from them; and thus the <HI>Liver, Gall-Bladder, Duodenum, Pan|creas, Spleen, Jejunum, Ilium,</HI> and a large Share of the <HI>Colon</HI> have their Nerves &s;ent from this great <HI>&s;olar Ganglion</HI> or <HI>Plexus.</HI></P>
<P>Several Fibres of this Ganglion running down upon the Aorta, meet with other Nerves &s;ent from the po&s;terior Trunk of the Inter|co&s;tal, which continues its Cour&s;e along the Sides of the <HI>Vertebrae,</HI> they &s;upply the <HI>Glandulae renales,</HI> Kidneys and <HI>Te&s;tes</HI> in Men or <HI>Ovaria</HI> in Women; and then they form a Net-work upon the inferior me&s;enteric Artery where the Nerves of the two Sides meet, and accom|pany the Branches of this Artery to the Part of the <HI>Colon</HI> that lies in the left Side or the Belly, and to the <HI>Rectum</HI> as far down as the lower Part of the <HI>Pelvis.</HI></P>
<P>The Interco&s;tal continuing down by the Side of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Loins, is joined by Nerves coming from between the&s;e <HI>Ver|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ebrae,</HI> and &s;ends Nerves to the Organs of Generation and others in the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> being
<PB N="58" REF="61">even joined with tho&s;e that are &s;ent to the in|ferior Extremities.</P>
<P>The almo&s;t univer&s;al Connection and Com|munication this Nerve has with the other Nerves of the Body, may lead us to under|&s;tand a great many <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> where one otherwi&s;e would be greatly &s;urprized at the Sympathy to be ob&s;erved among the Parts of the Body. One who knows the Cour&s;e of this Nerve will readily under&s;tand why a Stone in the Kidneys, or Ureters, or any other Cau&s;e irritating tho&s;e Organs, &s;hould &s;o much more frequently bring on Vomiting and other Di&s;|orders of the Stomach, than the Stone or any other &s;timulating Cau&s;e in the Bladder does. The Ob&s;tructions of the <HI>Men&s;es</HI> will hence appear capable of occa&s;ioning Strangulations, Belching, Colicks, Stomach-aches, and even Convul&s;ions in the Extremities may be owing to &s;uch Ob&s;tructions, or to any violent Irrita|tions of the Stomach or Guts. With a View to the&s;e Communications, I have frequently applied Ve&s;icatories from the Ears to the Cla|vicles of Children labouring under the <HI>Tu&s;&s;is convul&s;iva</HI> with ob&s;ervable good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;pinal</HI> Nerves ri&s;e generally by a Num|ber of di&s;gregated Fibres from both the ante|rior and po&s;terior Part of the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> and &s;oon after form a little Knot or Ganglion where they get on their firm Coats, and are extended into firm Cords. They are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by Numbers, according to the <HI>Verte|brae</HI> from between which they come out, the &s;uperior of the two Bones forming the Hole thro' which they pa&s;s, being the one from which the Number is applied to each Nerve.
<PB N="59" REF="62">There are generally &s;aid to be <HI>thirty Pair</HI> of them, &s;even of which come out between the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the <HI>Neck,</HI> twelve between tho&s;e of the <HI>Back,</HI> five from the <HI>Loins,</HI> and &s;ix from the <HI>Os &s;acrum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>FIRST CERVICAL</HI> Pair of Nerves comes out between the fir&s;t and &s;econd <HI>Ver|tebrae</HI> of the Neck, and having given Branches to join with the tenth Pair of the Head, the &s;econd Cervical and Interco&s;tal, and to &s;erve the Mu&s;cles that bend the Neck, it &s;ends its large&s;t Branches backwards to the exten|&s;or Mu&s;cles of the Head and Neck; &s;ome of which piercing thro' the&s;e Mu&s;cles run up on the <HI>Occiput</HI> to be lo&s;t in the Teguments there; and many Fibres of it advance &s;o far forward, as to be connected w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">th the <HI>Fibrillae</HI> of the fir&s;t Branch of the fifth Pair of the Head, and of the <HI>Portio Dura</HI> of the <HI>Auditory Nerve.</HI> Hence po&s;&s;ibly it is that a <HI>Clavus hy&s;tericus</HI> &s;hall &s;uddenly change from the Fore-head to a violent Pain and Spa&s;m in the Back-part of the Head and Neck.</P>
<P>The <HI>SECOND CERVICAL</HI> is &s;oon joined by &s;ome Branches to the ninth of the Head and Interco&s;tal, and to the fir&s;t and third of the Neck, then has a large Branch that comes out at the exterior Edge of the <HI>Sternoma&s;toideus</HI> Mu&s;cle, where it joins with the <HI>Acce&s;&s;orius</HI> of the eighth Pair, and then is di&s;tributed to the <HI>Platy&s;ma Myoides,</HI> Teguments of the Side of the Neck and Head, parotid Gland and exter|nal Ear, being connected to the <HI>Portio Dura</HI> of the Auditory Nerve and to the fir&s;t cervi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">al.

<P>To the Irritation of the Branches of this Nerve, it probably is, that in an Inflammation of the parotid Gland, the Neck is pain'd as far down as the Clavicle, the Head is drawn towards the Shoulder of the affected Side, and the Chin is turned to the other Side. In open|ing the external Jugular-Vein, no Operator can promi&s;e not to touch &s;ome of the cutane|ous Branches of this Nerve with the Edge of the Lancet, which occa&s;ions a &s;harp pricking Pain in the mean Time, and a Numne&s;s of the Skin near the Orifice for &s;ome Time after.</P>
<P>The <HI>THIRD PAIR</HI> of the Neck pa&s;&s;es out between the third and fourth cervical <HI>Verte|brae,</HI> having immediately a Communication with the &s;econd, and &s;ending down a Branch, which being joined by a Branch from the fourth cervical forms the <HI>PHRENIC</HI> Nerve. This de&s;ceding enters the <HI>Thorax</HI> between the &s;ub|clavian Vein and Artery, and then being re|ceived into a Groove formed for it in the <HI>Pericardium,</HI> it has its Cour&s;e along this <HI>Cap|&s;ula</HI> of the Heart, till it is lo&s;t in the middle Part of the Diaphragm. The right Phrenic has a pretty &s;treight Cour&s;e, but the left one is obliged to make a con&s;iderable Turn out|wards, to go over the prominent Part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Pericardium</HI> where the Point of the Heart i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> lodged.

<PB N="61" REF="64">Nerve are di&s;tributed to the Mu&s;cles and Te|guments at the inferior Part of the Neck and Top of the Shoulder.

<P>The Irritation of the thoracic Nerves &s;o as to produce &s;neezing, may &s;ometimes free the phrenic Nerves from any Spa&s;m they occa&s;i|on; &s;o that &s;neezing &s;ometimes takes away the Hiccough, and a Derivation of the Fluid of the Nerves any other way may do the &s;ame Thing: Or the Hiccough may al&s;o be &s;ome|times cured by a Surprize, or any other &s;trong Application of the Mind in thinking or in di&s;|tingui&s;hing Objects.</P>
<P>The <HI>FOURTH CERVICAL</HI> Nerve, after &s;ending off that Branch which joins with the third to form the Phrenic, and be&s;towing Twigs on the Mu&s;cles and Glands of the Neck runs to the Arm-Pit, where it meets with the <HI>FIFTH, SIXTH</HI> and <HI>SEVENTH</HI> Cervicals' and <HI>FIRST DORSAL,</HI> that e&s;cape in the Inter&s;tices of the <HI>Mu&s;culi &s;caleni,</HI> to come at the Arm-Pit where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y join, &s;epa|rate, and re-join in a way &s;carce to be rightly expre&s;&s;ed in Words; and after giving &s;everal
<PB N="62" REF="65">con&s;iderable Nerves to the Mu&s;cles and Te|guments which cover the <HI>Thorax,</HI> they divide into &s;everal Branches to be di&s;tributed to all the Parts of the &s;uperior Extremity. Seven of the&s;e Branches I &s;hall de&s;cribe under particu|lar Names.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CUTANEUS</HI> runs down the Fore-part of the Arm near the Skin to which it gives off Branches, and then divides on the Fore-arm into &s;everal Nerves, which &s;upply the Tegu|ments there and on the Palm of the Hand. In opening the Cephalic Vein of the Arm at the ordinary Place, the &s;ame Symptoms are pro|duced, as I mentioned to be done in opening the external Jugular-Vein, and by the like Cau&s;e, to wit, the hurting a Branch of this cutaneous Nerve with the Lancet.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>MUSCULO-CUTANEUS</HI> or <HI>perforans Ca&s;&s;erii</HI> pa&s;&s;es thro' the <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">raco-brachialis</HI> Mu&s;|cle, and, after &s;upplying the <HI>biceps flexor cu|biti</HI> and <HI>brachiaeus internus,</HI> is &s;pent on the Te|guments on the out-&s;ide of the Fore-arm and Back of the Hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>MUSCULARIS</HI> has a &s;piral Cour&s;e from the <HI>Axilla</HI> under the <HI>Os humeri,</HI> and back|ward to the external Part of that Bone, &s;up|plying by the Way the exten&s;or Mu&s;cles of the Fore-arm, to which it runs between the two <HI>brachiaei</HI> Mu&s;cles, to be chiefly be&s;tow|ed on the Mu&s;cles that extend the Wri&s;t and Fingers; &s;ome of its Branches going likewi&s;e to the Flexors, and others &s;erving the Skin on the out-&s;ide of the Fore-arm, the Extremity of it de&s;cends along the <HI>Radius</HI> to the Back of the Hand, in which, and in the back convex Part
<PB N="63" REF="66">of the Thumb and three large Fingers it termi|nates.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>ULNARIS</HI> is extended along the In-&s;ide of the Arm, to give Nerves to the Mu&s;cles that extend the Fore-arm and to the Teguments of the Elbow; towards the lower Part of the Arm it &s;lants a little backward to come at the Groove behind the internal Condyle of the <HI>Os humeri,</HI> thro' which it runs to the <HI>Ulna;</HI> in its Cour&s;e along this Bone it &s;erves the neighbouring Mu&s;cles and Teguments; and as it comes near the Wri&s;t, it detaches a Branch obliquely over the <HI>Ulna</HI> to the Back of the Hand, to be lo&s;t in the convex Part of &s;e|veral Fingers. The larger Part of the Nerve goes &s;traight forward to the internal Side of the <HI>Os pi&s;iforme</HI> of the Wri&s;t; where it &s;ends off a Branch which &s;inks under the large Ten|dons in the Palm, to go cro&s;s to the other Side of the Wri&s;t, &s;erving the <HI>mu&s;culi lumbricales</HI> and <HI>intero&s;&s;ei,</HI> and at la&s;t terminating in the &s;hort Mu&s;cles of the Thumb and Fore-finger. What remains of the ulnar Nerve, after &s;upply|ing the &s;hort Mu&s;cles of the Little-finger, di|vides into three Branches; whereof two are ex|tended along the Sides of the Sheath of the Tendons of the Flexors of the Little-finger, to furni&s;h the concave Side of that Finger; and the third Branch is di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame Way upon the Side of the Ring-finger next to the Little finger.</P>
<P>When we lean or pre&s;s on the inter|nal Condyle of the <HI>Os humeri,</HI> the Num|ne&s;s and Prickling we frequently feel point out the Cour&s;e of this Nerve; I have &s;een a Weakne&s;s and Atrophy in the Parts which I
<PB N="64" REF="67">mentioned this Nerve to be &s;ent to, after a Wound in the internal inferior Part of the Arm.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>RADIALIS</HI> accompanies the humeral Artery to the bending of the Elbow, &s;erving the Flexors of the Cubit in its Way; then, af|ter giving large Nerves to the Mu&s;cles on the Fore-part of the Fore-arm, it continues its Cour&s;e near to the <HI>Radius,</HI> be&s;towing Branches on the circumjacent Mu&s;cles. Near the Wri&s;t it gives off a Nerve which is di&s;tributed to the Back of the Hand, and the convex Part of the Thumb, and &s;everal of the Fingers. The larger Part of this Nerve pa&s;&s;ing behind the an|nular Ligament of the Wri&s;t gives Nerves to the &s;hort Mu&s;cles of the Thumb, and after|wards &s;ends a Branch along each Side of the Sheath of the Tendons of the Flexors of the Thumb, Fore-finger, Middle-finger, and one Branch to the Side of the Ring-finger next to the Middle, to be lo&s;t on the concave Side of tho&s;e Fingers.</P>
<P>The Manner of the&s;e Nerves of the Fingers, both from the <HI>Ulnar</HI> and <HI>Radial</HI> going off, is that a &s;ingle Branch is &s;ent from the Trunk to the Side of the Thumb and Little-finger far|the&s;t from the other Fingers; and all the re&s;t are &s;upplied by a Trunk of a Nerve, which &s;plits into two &s;ome way before it comes as far as the End of the <HI>Metacarpus,</HI> to run along the Sides of different Fingers that are neare&s;t to each other.</P>
<P>It might have been ob&s;erved, that in de&s;crib|ing the po&s;terior Branches of the <HI>ulnar</HI> and <HI>ra|dial Nerve,</HI> I did not mention the particular Fingers, to the convex Part of which, they were
<PB N="65" REF="68">di&s;tributed. My Rea&s;on for this Omi&s;&s;ion is the Uncertainty of their Distribution; for tho' &s;ometimes the&s;e po&s;terior Branches go to the &s;ame Fingers, to the concave Part of which their anterior Branches are &s;ent, yet frequent|ly they are di&s;tributed otherwi&s;e, and I ought to ob&s;erve that the mu&s;cular Nerve has not always that Termination in the Back of the Hand which I mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI> and <HI>Dia&s;tole</HI> OF THE HEART, And the Reciprocal Actions of its AURICLES and VENTRICLES ACCOUNTED FOR.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT the Account I am to give of the alternate Motions of the Heart may be rightly under&s;tood, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to mention the few following Propo&s;itions on which it depends.</P>
<P N="1">1. All Mu&s;cles are furni&s;hed with Blood|ve&s;&s;els and Nerves, and their Action depends on the Influx of Blood, and of the nervous Fluid into their mu&s;cular Fibres; therefore whenever Mu&s;cles are deprived of a &s;ufficient Quantity of either one or other of the&s;e Li|quors
<PB N="73" REF="76">or of both, their Action is weakned or cea&s;es. The Truth of this has been fully proved by the Experiments of compre&s;&s;ing, tying and cutting the Nerves or Arteries of Mu&s;cles.</P>
<P N="2">2. All Mu&s;cles are in a con&s;tant State of Action as long as Blood and nervous Fluid are freely &s;upplied to them. This &s;eems e|vident from the continued Contraction of the Sphincters of the Bladder and <HI>Anus</HI> and of Mu&s;cles, who&s;e Antagoni&s;ts are cut a&s;under or become paralytic.</P>
<P>Tho' in the&s;e two Propo&s;itions, I have a&s;|&s;umed a Fluid of the Nerves, for the Proba|bility of which, &s;ee the Arguments in the fore|going Treati&s;e, yet to avoid a Di&s;pute, it may be here remarked, that the following Account of the Heart's Motions, will equally hold good, by &s;uppo&s;ing the Nerves to be &s;olid Cords acting by Ela&s;ticity, Vibration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if it is only granted, that their Action is nece&s;&s;a|ry to the Contraction of Mu&s;cles, and that Compre&s;&s;ion is capable to hinder that Action, which Experiments plainly &s;hew it is.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Nerves of the Heart pa&s;s to it be|tween the two Auricles or two Arteries, and between the Auricles and Arteries.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Coronary</HI> Arteries, which are the only ones that &s;upply the Heart, ri&s;e from the <HI>Aorta</HI> immediately above the middle loo&s;e Part of the &s;emilunar Valves, in the &s;ame Height of the <HI>Aorta</HI> as where the Angles of the&s;e Valves are fixed.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Edges of the &s;emilunar Valves are duplicated with a mu&s;cular Corpu&s;cle in the Middle, and mu&s;cular Cords running oblique|ly
<PB N="74" REF="77">from that Corpu&s;cle to the In&s;ertion of the Valves into the <HI>Aorta.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e three la&s;t Propo&s;itions are evidently made appear to be true by Di&s;&s;ections.</P>
<P N="6">6. Before the Ve&s;&s;els in which the Circula|tion is performed can act, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e them full of their Liquors, otherwi&s;e the whole Va&s;cular Sy&s;tem could not be all at once put into Action, and the Motion of the Fluids &s;ent out from the Heart, could not be propagated to that in the returning Ve&s;&s;els; con&s;equently the Circulation would be &s;top|ped almo&s;t as &s;oon as begun.</P>
<P>If then both Auricles and Ventricles at|tempt, upon the fir&s;t Communication of Mo|tion, to contract; the Ventricles being &s;trong|er will force their own Contraction, and hinder the Contraction of the Auricles, which mu&s;t be in the mean time much dilated by the Influx of Blood from the Veins (Prop. 6.) and at this Time, the Arteries are al&s;o di&s;tended by the Blood thrown out of the Ventricles; therefore the Cardiac Nerves lying between them, (Prop. 3.) will be compre&s;&s;ed and pre|vented from exerting their Office. While this happens to the Nerves, the Blood ru&s;hing out of the left Ventricle into the <HI>Aorta,</HI> and thru&s;ting the &s;emilunar Valves outwards and upwards, di&s;tends the great Artery con&s;ider|ably, whereby the Valves are &s;tretched, and their lunated Edges are brought to be &s;traight and as high as their Angles; con&s;equently the&s;e Edges, thus rai&s;ed and pre&s;&s;ed to the Sides of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> are made to cover the Ori|fices of the <HI>Arteriae coronariae,</HI> which the Cor|pu&s;cles will a&s;&s;i&s;t to do more adequately; and
<PB N="75" REF="78">therefore, while they are in this Situation, no Blood can be &s;ent to the Sub&s;tance of the Heart. If then the Nerves do not exert their Office, and Acce&s;s is denied to the Blood, This Mu&s;cle, the Heart mu&s;t (by Prop. 1.) become paralytic or unactive.</P>
<P>The Auricles, which were attempting all this Time to contract them&s;elves, will now, when the Re&s;i&s;tance to them is removed, throw the Blood they contain into the Ven|tricles; and the Arteries that were violently di&s;tended while the Ventricles pu&s;hed the Blood into them, will at this &s;ame Time when the Ventricles cea&s;e to act, con&s;trict them&s;elves; and the <HI>Valvulae &s;emilunares</HI> will, by their Ela&s;ticity a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the mu&s;cular Cor|pu&s;cles and Cords, be depre&s;&s;ed inwards. Since then, by the Con&s;triction of the Au|ricles and Arteries, the Nerves of the Ven|tricles are freed from the Compre&s;&s;ion they &s;uffered while the Auricles and Arteries were di&s;tended; and &s;ince the Blood in the <HI>Aorta</HI> pre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly by the contracting Sides of this Artery, and re&s;i&s;ted, by the Liquors which are to be thrown through all its Bran|ches, is al&s;o pu&s;hed with great Force on the Orifice of the left Ventricle, thru&s;ts back the &s;emilunar Valves which &s;top its Entry into that Cavity, and impetuou&s;ly ru&s;hes into the coronary Arteries: Since then, I &s;ay, the Nerves of the Heart are again free from Com|pre&s;&s;ion, and the Blood is again &s;ent to the Heart by its Arteries, its mu&s;cular Fibres mu&s;t again contract (by Prop. 2.) And thus, as long as the&s;e Cau&s;es continue to act and cea&s;e alter|nately, their Effects mu&s;t be exerted in the &s;ame
<PB N="76" REF="79">Manner; that is, as long as an Animal lives, the Heart mu&s;t have an alternate State of Con|traction called its <HI>Sy&s;tole,</HI> and of Relaxation or <HI>Dia&s;tole;</HI> and the Auricles and Arteries mu&s;t be dilated, while the Ventricles are con|tracting, and the Ventricles mu&s;t be dilated while the Auricles and Arteries are con&s;tri|cted, or their Actions mu&s;t always be recipro|cal.</P>

<P>_THE <HI>Receptaculum Chyli</HI> of <HI>Pecquet,</HI> or <HI>Saccus lacteus</HI> of <HI>Van Horne,</HI> is a membranous &s;omewhat pyri|form Bag, two Thirds of an Inch long, one Third of an Inch over in its large&s;t Part when colla&s;ped; &s;ituated on the fir&s;t <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Loins to the Right of the Aorta, a little higher than the right emul|gent Artery, behind the right inferior Mu&s;cle of the Diaphragm; it is formed by the Union of three Tubes, one from under the Aorta, the &s;econd from the Inter&s;tice of the Aorta and Cava, the third from under the Emul|gents of the right Side. The <HI>Lacteal Sac,</HI> becoming gradually &s;maller towards its &s;upe|rior Part, is contracted into a &s;lender mem|branous Pipe, of about a Line Diameter,
<PB N="78" REF="81">which is generally named, The <HI>THORACIC DUCT.</HI> This pa&s;&s;es betwixt the mu&s;cular <HI>Ap|pendices</HI> or inferior Mu&s;cles of the Diaphragm, on the Right of, and &s;omewhat behind the A|orta; then, being lodged in the cellular Sub|&s;tance behind the <HI>Pleura,</HI> it mounts between this Artery and the <HI>Vena azygos</HI> as far as the fifth <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Thorax, where it is hid by the <HI>azygos</HI> as this Vein ri&s;es forwards to join the de&s;cending or &s;uperior <HI>Cava,</HI> after which the Duct pa&s;&s;es obliquely over to the left Side behind the <HI>O E&s;ophagus, Aorta de&s;cen|dens,</HI> and great Curvature of the Aorta un|til it reaches the left carotid Artery; behind which, and on the left Side of the <HI>O E&s;ophagus</HI> it runs to the Inter&s;tice of the fir&s;t and &s;econd <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Thorax, where it begins to &s;e|parate from the carotid, &s;tretching farther to|wards the left internal Jugular Vein by a cir|cular Turn, who&s;e convex Part is uppermo&s;t. At the Top of this Arch it &s;plits into two for a Line and a half, the &s;uperior Branch receiv|ing into it a large lymphatic Ve&s;&s;el from the cervical Glands. This Lymphatic appears, by blowing Air and injecting Liquors into it, to have no Valves; when the two Branches are again united, the Duct continues its Cour&s;e towards the internal Jugular Vein, behind which it de&s;cends, and immediately at the left Side of the In&s;ertion of this Vein enters the &s;uperior po&s;terior Part of the left &s;ubcla|vian Vein, who&s;e internal Membrane dupli|cated forms a &s;emilunar Valve that is convex externally, and covers two Thirds of the Ori|fice of the Duct; immediately below this Ori|fice
<PB N="79" REF="82">a cervical Vein from the <HI>Mu&s;culi &s;caleni</HI> enters the &s;ubclavian</P>

<P>This is the mo&s;t &s;imple and common Cour&s;e, Situation and Structure of the <HI>Re|ceptaculum chyli</HI> and <HI>thoracic Duct;</HI> but ha|ving had Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve a Variety in the&s;e Parts of different Subjects, I &s;hall &s;et down the mo&s;t remarkable of them.</P>
<P>The Sac is &s;ometimes &s;ituated lower down than in the former De&s;cription, is not always of the &s;ame Dimen&s;ions, is not compo&s;ed of the &s;ame Number of Ducts, and frequently appears divided into &s;everal &s;mall Cells, in|&s;tead of being one &s;imple Cavity.</P>
<P>The Diameter of the Duct is various in mo&s;t Bodies, and is &s;eldom uniform in the &s;ame Subject; but frequently &s;udden Enlarge|ments or <HI>Sacculi</HI> of it are ob&s;ervable.

The preci&s;e <HI>Vertebra,</HI> where it begins to turn to the left Side, is al&s;o uncer|tain. Frequently it does not &s;plit at its &s;upe|rior Arch; in which Ca&s;e a large Sac is found
<PB N="80" REF="83">near its Aperture into the &s;ubclavian Vein. Generally it has but one Orifice; tho' I have &s;een two in one Body, and three in another: Nay &s;ometimes it divides into two, under the Curvature of the great Artery; one goes to the right, another to the left &s;ubclavian Vein; and I have found this Duct di&s;charging it|&s;elf entirely into the right &s;ubclavian. The lymphatic Ve&s;&s;el which enters its &s;uperior Arch is often &s;ent from the <HI>thyroid</HI> Gland.</P>
<P>Whether is not the Situation of the <HI>Recep|taculum chyli</HI> &s;o much nearer the mu&s;cular <HI>Appendices</HI> of the Diaphragm in Men than Brutes, de&s;igned to &s;upply the di&s;advantageous Cour&s;e the Chyle mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have in our erect Po&s;ture?</P>
