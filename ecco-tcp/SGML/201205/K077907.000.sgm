<P>This engag'd me to ask the Liberty of Prefixing your Name to this Trifle; which however unworthy it may be of the Honour, will yet derive a double Advan|tage from it; fir&s;t to It&s;elf, then to it's Author: It will It&s;elf, by this Means, pa&s;s un|que&s;tion'd into the World; and it's Author will have an Opportunity of paying due Acknowledgments, for the

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Think it Nece&s;&s;ary for my own Vindication to &s;ay Something by Way of Preface, and I expect to be pardon'd for it by all Hone&s;t Impartial Men; for 'tis to &s;uch only I appeal, having already &s;uffer'd as much as I could &s;uffer, from Men of a Character quite contrary.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry I have it to &s;ay, That the wor&s;t U&s;age I have met with, has
<PB N="10" REF="8">been from the Gentlemen of my own Profe&s;&s;ion; and that this Trifle of mine whil&s;t an <HI>Embryo,</HI> has been &s;uf|ficiently ridicul'd by them: 'Tis, perhaps, &s;till &s;hapele&s;s and unform'd; but if there are found in it the Fea|tures of a Man, 'twill at lea&s;t demand &s;ome Regard from all tho&s;e who would de&s;erve the Character of Men. I have been driven to &s;uch a <HI>Dilem|ma</HI> by their Unnatural Treatment, that for &s;ome Time I have &s;u&s;pen|ded the Publication, and was once re&s;olv'd intirely to &s;uppre&s;s it. This following has been their Way of Ar|guing, <HI>If 'tis his Own, 'twill not bear the Light; if 'twill bear the Light, 'tis not his Own;</HI> either Side of this would be equally prejudicial to me: But I &s;hall endeavour to prove, that if I have not made a very ill U&s;e of
<PB N="11" REF="9">my Time and Advantages, it may bear the Light, and yet be my Own.</P>
<P>When I have done this in the be&s;t Manner I am capable, I &s;hall de&s;ire this following Fair Challenge may be annex'd to my Account of My&s;elf: That if any of my <HI>&V;nkind Brethren</HI> have any Thing to &s;ay, which They think will prove me too ignorant for my Profe&s;&s;ion, that they may do it in the &s;ame publick Manner which I have made U&s;e of to prove that I am not &s;o.</P>
<P>The Worthy Gentleman to whom I have made an Offer of this Trifle in the <HI>Dedication,</HI> will be my Wit|ne&s;s of rhe Truth of the following Particulars: That I attended the Pra|ctice of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Ho&s;pital regu|larly
<PB N="12" REF="10">and diligently the Time I was a PUPIL there, and that it was fur|ni&s;h'd at that Time with a Sett of the Be&s;t and mo&s;t Rational Practitioners which have been ever known there.</P>
<P>I think according to the Account of the Ho&s;pital, that there are very &s;eldom le&s;s than 4 or 5000 Subjects cured of their &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es in a Year; and I believe it will very rea|dily be granted by all unprejudic'd People, that where Accidents are &s;o various and numerous, a young Sur|geon may improve him&s;elf more in five or &s;ix Months, than he can with the be&s;t private Ma&s;ter in the King|dom in as many Years: Here more|over a Man has the Opportunity of learning every Branch of his Profe&s;|&s;ion; and he who does not endea|vour
<PB N="13" REF="11">to practi&s;e it afterwards, as it comes in his Way, ought (I think) to be &s;u&s;pected of great Negligence in his Ob&s;ervation, or Want of Abi|lity to &s;ee into the Rea&s;on of the Pra|ctice; either of which will certainly make him fearful of undertaking it, becau&s;e the Succe&s;s will always ap|pear doubtful to him: But when a Man has by diligent Ob&s;ervation on the Chirurgical Part, and a compe|tent Knowledge of the Rational, qua|lify'd him&s;elf to di&s;charge the Duty of his Profe&s;&s;ion with Ability and Hone&s;ty, I think his endeavouring to do &s;o, &s;hould not only not ren|der him obnoxious to the Gentle|men of his Profe&s;&s;ion, but even make him claim &s;ome Share of their Re|gard, and Protection too from the In&s;ults of the re&s;t of the World:
<PB N="14" REF="12">But to come nearer to the Point, and the Occa&s;ion of this <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to practi&s;e in this City, full of Expectation of the U|&s;age ju&s;t now mention'd, I &s;oon found my&s;elf mi&s;erably deceiv'd; for in&s;tead of That, I was immediately &s;urrounded with <HI>Calumny</HI> and <HI>Detra|ction:</HI> And from what Quarter? Why even from tho&s;e Gentlemen by whom I thought to be <HI>Protected:</HI> There was immediately a <HI>Party</HI> rai|&s;ed again&s;t me, who not contented with a&s;per&s;ing my Abilities, fell foul upon my Manners; and would fain have in&s;inuated, (if they could have got any Man of Sen&s;e to have be|liev'd them) that if a Man wore to|lerable good Cloaths, and lik'd the Company of a Friend, 'twas impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="15" REF="13">he could be a good Surgeon: The&s;e are a Sett of worthy People, who are them&s;elves</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Dully grave, in&s;ipidly &s;erene,</L>
<L>And carry all their Wi&s;dom in their Mien.</L></Q>
<P>And in &s;hort, they like Nobody, but &s;uch as are like them&s;elves: So that an Awkard <HI>Saint-like</HI> Behaviour, a <HI>Solemn</HI> Gait, an <HI>Hypocritial</HI> Eleva|tion of the Eye, and an <HI>Affected Religious</HI> Grimace, is &s;ufficient with them to &s;et a Man at the Head of his Profe&s;&s;ion. If a Man is recom|mended to any of them, the Fir&s;t Que&s;tion is, <HI>Is he One of &V;s?</HI> If they are an&s;wer'd in the Negative, they immediately fly; and tho' they know Nothing of the Man, &s;wear he has no Faith, no Honour, no Ca|pacity,
<PB N="16" REF="14">no Money, nor any Thing el&s;e which can render a Man quali|fy'd to be employ'd in any Thing.</P>
<P>'Tis a great Hard&s;hip to fall into the Hands of the&s;e Gentlemen, and yet to be quite void of all tho&s;e va|luable Talents which mu&s;t recom|mend one to their Favour. For my Part, if I am call'd to a Patient, I expect my Bu&s;ine&s;s is with his <HI>Body,</HI> and not with his <HI>Soul:</HI> I can <HI>Set</HI> a Broken Leg, as well as my Neigh|bours; but as to <HI>Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience,</HI> I mu&s;t leave them to be &s;et right by Gentlemen who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion qualifies and authorizes them to do it.</P>
<P>But I am afraid, if we come to ex|amin the Matter a little more clo&s;e|ly, we &s;hall find that this is generally
<PB N="17" REF="15">all Stratagem; and that my <HI>Worthy</HI> Brethren who make u&s;e of it, have an odd Way of impo&s;ing upon the World, and giving of it one Term for another: Their pretended <HI>Gravity</HI> &s;hould be call'd <HI>Natural Dulne&s;s,</HI> for 'tis &s;o in Fact; and where there is Fire, it will &s;hew it&s;elf: Their Pre|tence to <HI>Religion,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Human Rea&s;on,</HI> is not becau&s;e they have <HI>more</HI> of the Fir&s;t than their Neighbours, but <HI>le&s;s</HI> of the Latter: Their <HI>Canting</HI> Cu&s;tom of Asking a peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing on every Thing they undertake, is becau&s;e they know their Skill will &s;tand very much in Need of it: Their Di&s;affection to Human Learning is, becau&s;e they know Nothing more of it than the Name; and &s;o of every Thing el&s;e;
<PB N="18" REF="16">In &s;hort, I am tir'd of them; but I'll beg Leave to &s;ay, they are very pret|ty People to tru&s;t Mens Lives and Limbs with.</P>
<P>I have often wonder'd, that when the ACT was made for Examining all Surgeons (before they were ad|mitted to practi&s;e in and about <HI>Lon|don</HI>) at <HI>Surgeons-Hall,</HI> the &s;ame Or|der did not pa&s;s thro' every County, that the Country might have had the &s;ame Advantage of having a Sett of Able Men among&s;t them as the Town has: Many and great would have been the Benefits of it, to the Profe&s;&s;ion in General, to every Able Profe&s;&s;or of it in Particular, and to all tho&s;e who&s;e Misfortunes oblige them to have Recour&s;e to It or Them for A&s;&s;i|&s;tance.
<PB N="19" REF="17">Every Apprentice would be oblig'd to be diligently attentive in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to qualifie him|&s;elf to pa&s;s his Examination; and this certainly in Time would be of infinite Advantage to the Profe&s;&s;ion: Every Able Profe&s;&s;or of it would certainly be known, by that very Examination, to be &s;o; and by this Means would be plac'd in his pro|per Sphere, and fear no Danger from the <HI>Canting Blockheads</HI> beneath him. The Benefit of the Patient, is too ob|vious to be in&s;i&s;ted upon; his Limbs very frequently, and often his Life too would be pre&s;erv'd by it.</P>
<P>But as a <HI>Capacity</HI> is not Every Thing which is requir'd of a Surgeon, I wi&s;h there was any Method as certain as
<PB N="20" REF="18">this, to try their <HI>Hone&s;ty:</HI> Some I have known who have wanted Both, others who have had the Fir&s;t and wanted the Latter; but in order to make a Good Surgeon, 'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a Man &s;hould want Neither of them. I'll beg the Liberty to relate a Story or Two of a Gen|tleman who has been remarkably kind to me, and I am very glad I have this Opportunity of returning his Civility, and letting the World know that he is a Man of <HI>Real Me|rit:</HI> This Friend of mine was &s;ent for to a Child that had di&s;located its Knee, he carried with him Plai&s;ters, Bandage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to reduce it, which he endeavour'd to do in the be&s;t Manner his Capacity would ad|mit of; after the Bu&s;ine&s;s was over,
<PB N="21" REF="19">he encourag'd the Friends by promi|&s;ing the greate&s;t Succe&s;s: Next Day he call'd to &s;ee his little Patient, and found the Family much pleas'd at his <HI>great</HI> Skill, declaring that the Child's Complaint in that Part was intirely remov'd: The Doctor finding in this Ca&s;e that he had not &s;pent his Skill in vain, began to exert him&s;elf upon it, and undertook a Ca&s;e of much more Difficulty, (which prov'd a <HI>Di&s;|location</HI> in Fact) in which he a&s;&s;ured them of the like Succe&s;s, and that he would cure that as expeditiou&s;ly as he did the other; which, to prove his A&s;&s;ertions true, he actually did; by which <HI>wonderful</HI> Cure he has demon|&s;trated his <HI>Genius</HI> in a <HI>laudable</HI> Man|ner. Another Brother of mine (&s;ome &s;mall Di&s;tance from this Place) had the Care of a Gentlewoman, whom
<PB N="22" REF="20">he kept in Torment &s;everal Years, and left her at la&s;t as Bad or Wor&s;e than he found her; &s;he applied her|&s;elf to a Surgeon of my Acquain|tance, who made a perfect Cure of her in Fourteen Days: This <HI>Won|derful</HI> Man was ask'd &s;ome Time af|ter, How it came about that a Man of his <HI>pretended</HI> Abilities and long Practice, after a Trial of Years, &s;hould mi&s;s of Succe&s;s in a Ca&s;e where a Young Fellow ju&s;t beginning to pra|cti&s;e, &s;ucceeded to the Surprize of the whole Town in a few Days? And whether he did not think it ought to dimini&s;h his Character, and add to the Character of the other? He had a Conflict with him&s;elf for &s;ome Time whether he &s;hould &s;a|crifice his <HI>Capacity</HI> or <HI>Hone&s;ty;</HI> at la&s;t it went on the Side of <HI>Dear Ca|pacity,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="21">and an&s;wer'd, <HI>She had Mo|ney!</HI> But I &s;hall leave him as I found him; and ha&s;ten to tell you the Rea|&s;on of my publi&s;hing the following Account of a CATARACT.</P>
<P>I am more &s;en&s;ible than any other Man can be, of my own Inability to perform accurately what I have propos'd in my <HI>Title-Page;</HI> my De|&s;ign not being at all to in&s;truct tho&s;e who&s;e regular Education in Phy&s;ick and Mathematicks have qualify'd them to under&s;tand the&s;e Things infinite|ly better than I can pretend to do: And I declare before I enter upon the Work, that I have no other View in it than to &s;atisfie the World that I am no <HI>Emprick</HI> (as I have been vilely and maliciou&s;ly repre&s;ented to
<PB N="24" REF="22">be) in my Profe&s;&s;ion of COUCH|ING; but that I know as much of the Nature and Structure of the EYE, as is requir'd of any one who pre|tends to the Operation.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why this nice and ne|ce&s;&s;ary Operation is &s;o rarely perfor|med by Gentlemen regularly bred to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Surgery, I take to be this; That it having been a long Time the di&s;tingui&s;hing Excellency of &s;eve|ral of our famous Mountebanks, the regular Surgeons, by undertaking it, are under the dreadful Apprehen&s;i|ons of being rank'd with itinerant Operators, commonly known by the Name of <HI>Quacks:</HI> The Fault is ab&s;o|lutely their own; for did they not join with the&s;e <HI>Empiricks</HI> (whom up|on
<PB N="25" REF="23">every other Account they &s;uffici|ently de&s;pi&s;e) to oppre&s;s every young Fellow who dares attempt a Thing which is not the general Profe&s;&s;ion of the whole Fraternity, whatever Pains he has taken, or whatever Ad|vantages he has had to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Performance; did they not join to do this, I &s;ay, how ineffe|ctual would all the little Malice and Calumny of the&s;e contemptible <HI>Wret|ches</HI> be towards ruining the Reputa|tion of a regular Surgeon! And how ea&s;ie would it be for us, (for 'tis We only who can do it) by making a Collection of the injudicious and barbarous Practices of tho&s;e illite|rate murdering <HI>Ra&s;eals,</HI> &s;o to de&s;troy their Reputations, (if 'tis not a Scan|dal to the Word <HI>Reputation</HI> to u&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="24">it in &s;uck Company) that in a few Years we might be able to take this and &s;ome other Branches of our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion Home to our&s;elves, the Ori|ginal Proprietors, without any Man|ner of Danger of the foregoing Im|putation.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Mechani&s;m of the EYE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I have propos'd to give &s;ome Account of the Me|chani&s;m of the EYE, I know no properer Way of beginning it, than by an Anatomical Di&s;&s;e|ction of the EYE It&s;elf; and after I have &s;hewn &s;ome few general Di&s;ea&s;es that the particu|lar Coats and Humors of the Eye are &s;ub|ject to, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew how the &s;aid Coats and Humors are in&s;trumental to
<PB N="28" REF="26">Vi&s;ion, and then by what particular Di&s;ea&s;es the Eye is render'd Totally Opake: And there I &s;hall endeavour to a&s;certain the true Place of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> and the Con&s;equence of a <HI>judicious</HI> or <HI>injudicious</HI> Removal of It.</P>
<P>The Globe of the Eye is moved by Six Mu&s;cles, Four Streight, and Two Oblique, <HI>viz. Elevator; Depre&s;&s;or, Adductor, Abductor, Obliquus Superior,</HI> and <HI>Inferior:</HI> The Fir&s;t of the&s;e ari&s;es out of the Bottom of the <HI>Or|bit,</HI> and after it has a&s;cended and grown ten|dinous, is in&s;erted into the Upper Part of the <HI>Tunica Sclerotis,</HI> near the <HI>Cornea.</HI> The <HI>De|pre&s;&s;or</HI> ari&s;es and is in&s;erted directly oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Elevator.</HI> The <HI>Adductor</HI> ari&s;es from the Bottom of the <HI>Orbit,</HI> and is in&s;erted on the Side next the No&s;e, into the <HI>Tunica Scle|rotis.</HI> The <HI>Abductor</HI> ari&s;es and is in&s;erted directly oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Adductor.</HI> The <HI>Su|perior</HI> Oblique Mu&s;cle ari&s;es between the <HI>Elevator</HI> and <HI>Adductor,</HI> at the Bottom of the <HI>Orbit,</HI> thence a&s;cending by the <HI>Sutura Tran&s;|ver&s;alis</HI> becomes a Round Tendon, which pa&s;&s;es thro' a little Annular Cartilage call'd <HI>Trochlea,</HI> (from its bearing the Form of a Pully) at the upper and inner Part of the
<PB N="29" REF="27"><HI>Orbit</HI> near its Edge, is in&s;erted near the Bot|tom of the Eye. The <HI>Inferior</HI> Oblique Mu&s;|cle ari&s;es from the <HI>Os Maxillae Superioris,</HI> thence pa&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Depre&s;&s;or,</HI> is in&s;erted at the Bottom of the Eye near the <HI>Abductor.</HI> The Four Streight Mu&s;cles are &s;o fix'd to the <HI>Sclerotis,</HI> that they lift up the Eye, de|pre&s;s it, bring it towards the No&s;e or from it, hold it fa&s;t, turn it round, ju&s;t as they act either &s;eparately or conjointly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Superior</HI> Oblique Mu&s;cle moves the Eye round towards the No&s;e about its <HI>Axis,</HI> and pulls it upward and inward, and there|by directs the Pupil outward and downward; and thus the Eye is di&s;pos'd to &s;ee Things placed near it. The <HI>Inferior</HI> Oblique Mu&s;|cle turns the Eye towards the outward Cor|ner, and al&s;o upwards; if the&s;e Two act together, they fix the Eye fierce and protu|berant out of the <HI>Orbit:</HI> Moreover, ano|ther U&s;e of the&s;e Mu&s;cles is, to &s;u&s;pend the Eye, and render it very fit to perform the Motions of the other Four. Between the&s;e Mu&s;cles Fat is inter&s;pers'd, which &s;erves to lubricate and facilitate their Motion.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="28">
<P>Next we come to the <HI>Coats</HI> and <HI>Humors</HI> of the Eye: The fir&s;t is the <HI>Tunica Adnata,</HI> or <HI>Conjunctiva;</HI> it makes that which is call'd the White of the Eye, and is full of Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; which are very vi&s;ible in an <HI>Ophthalmia:</HI> The Symptoms of this Di&s;ea&s;e are Heat, Pain, Pul&s;ation, and an apparent Di&s;tention of the&s;e Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; it may be occa&s;ion'd externally, by any Thing forc'd again&s;t or coming into the Eye, irritating or compre&s;&s;ing the Fibres of this Coat. If this Inflammation be only external, the Ca&s;e &s;ymptomatical, and the Patient not worne out by other Di&s;ea&s;es, 'tis ea&s;ily Curable: On the Contrary, if it becomes &s;o great as to tumefie the Face, and the Humors very pungent and corro&s;ive, we judge it difficult to cure. Its Cure depends on Bleeding, le|nient Purgation, Bli&s;tring, Cupping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> toge|ther with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a cooling Diet, topical Application, and proper <HI>Collyria.</HI></P>
<P>The next Coat is the <HI>Sclerotis:</HI> It expandes it&s;elf nearly into a Globe, membranous and hard almo&s;t like Leather, and encompa&s;&s;es the whole Eye, growing gradually thinner, clearer, and prominent in the Fore-part,
<PB N="31" REF="29">which Part of it is call'd <HI>Cornea,</HI> from its Tran&s;parency; they make together one firm Coat, for the U&s;e of the other Coats and Humors. This Coat is &s;ometimes di&s;eas'd by a little White Speck of a Cartilaginous Sub&s;tance, covering Part of, and &s;ometimes the whole <HI>Pupilla:</HI> If this Excre&s;cence is only &s;uperficial, it may be remov'd by an O|peration in Surgery call'd <HI>Leucotomy;</HI> but if the <HI>Cornea</HI> is throly affected, I believe it incurable. This Operation is perform'd in the following Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> I place the Pa|tient in a proper Po&s;ition, and fixing the <HI>Spe|culum Oculi</HI> invented for that Purpo&s;e in or|der to keep the Globe without Motion, pare off the Excre&s;cence with a &s;mall curv'd Knife, leaving as few Inequalities as po&s;&s;ible; and having prevented an Inflammation by proper Repellents, I blow a Powder into the Eye; which, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Motion of the Eye|lid, &s;mooths off the Inequalities left by the Knife.</P>
<P>Next to this Coat lies the <HI>Tunica Choroi|des:</HI> 'Tis a Membrane of little Firmne&s;s, be|ing much thinner than the former; 'tis ting'd by a dark Liquor &s;eparated from the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="32" REF="30">&s;o that it appears of a ru&s;ty dark Co|lour; this Coat has a Perforation in it, call'd <HI>Pupilla:</HI> The Part of this Coat which makes the Circumference of this Hole, and which lies upon the Side of the Cry&s;talline Hu|mor, is call'd <HI>Uvea,</HI> compos'd of circular and &s;treight Fibres; 'tis qualified by this Means to contract and dilate, as Light and Objects make different Impre&s;&s;ions upon it. The Out&s;ide of this la&s;t Membrane is call'd <HI>Iris,</HI> where appear different Colours: On the In&s;ide of it from its Circumference ari&s;e the <HI>Proce&s;&s;us Ciliares,</HI> made of &s;hort Fibres like Lines drawn from the Circumference to the Center.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Coat is the <HI>Retina,</HI> &s;o call'd from its Re&s;emblance to a Net; it covers the whole Fund of the Eye, and is nothing more than a fine Expan&s;ion of the Medullary Fi|bres of the Optick Nerve, upon which the Rays of Light meeting in a Point, convey the Images of outward Objects to the Brain. The Di&s;ea&s;e of this Coat is call'd <HI>Gutta Serena;</HI> the Eye &s;eems clear in Appearance, and there are no other Signs of Blindne&s;s ex|cept a preternatural Dilatation of the <HI>Pu|pilla.</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="31">I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak more largely of this Di&s;ea&s;e by and by.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e Coats are contain'd Three Humors, the <HI>Aqueous,</HI> the <HI>Cry&s;talline,</HI> and the <HI>Vitreous:</HI> The Fir&s;t is call'd <HI>Aqueous</HI> becau&s;e it re&s;embles Water, being a thin tran&s;parent Fluid; it &s;erves to extend the <HI>Cornea</HI> into an equal Convexity; be&s;ides, it &s;erves moreover for the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor to move forward or backward in, as Occa&s;ion requires us to &s;ee Objects nearer or farther from us.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Cry&s;talline:</HI> It's compounded of numberle&s;s &s;pherical Segments, clo&s;ely u|nited and tran&s;parent; its Shape is a depre&s;t Spheriod, it's inclos'd in a fine Membrane call'd <HI>Aranea,</HI> and is much thicker than ei|ther the <HI>Aqueous</HI> or <HI>Vitreous:</HI> Its Di&s;ea&s;es and U&s;es I &s;hall &s;peak of in another Place.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Vitreous:</HI> It's very clear and tenacious, it lies behind the <HI>Cry&s;talline,</HI> and fills the greate&s;t Part of the Eye; it's va&s;cular on every Side, its Fore&s;ide concave for the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor to lodge in, and
<PB N="34" REF="32">Back&s;ide convex; it keeps the <HI>Retina</HI> and <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor at a proper Di&s;tance: This Humor is &s;ometimes &s;o vitiated as to hinder or utterly de&s;troy Sight, which Di&s;|ea&s;e is often mi&s;took for a <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;peak of the Parts of the Eye, as they are &s;ub&s;ervient to Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of the Mu&s;cles in general is to direct the Globe of the Eye, and fix it in &s;uch a Po&s;ition, as that the Rays of Light reflected from any Object which we would have vi&s;ible to us, may pa&s;s thro' the <HI>Pupilla</HI> and paint the Image of it on the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>To form the Image of any Object, 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the Rays of Light coming from it &s;hould converge and meet in a <HI>Foous:</HI> And we judge of the comparative Magni|tude of all Bodies, by the Angle which is &s;ubtended by tho&s;e Bodies before the Eye.</P>
<P>To qualifie the Eye to perform this, Na|ture has given it a &s;pherical Form, and com|pos'd it of tran&s;parent Goats and Humors; the latter to tran&s;mit the Rays coming from
<PB N="35" REF="33">the luminous Points of Objects, and the for|mer to refract them in &s;uch a Degree as to bring them all together in a Point on the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>All convex diaphanous Bodies refract the Rays of Light by Attraction, and the Ray bends towards that Part or the Body where there is the greate&s;t Quantity of Matter; this in convex Bodies is the Middle.</P>
<P>Therefore all Rays on whatever Parts of &s;uch Bodies they fall, are refracted to|wards a Line drawn thro' the Center of tho&s;e Bodies, and made to converge behind them at a Di&s;tance proportionable to the greater or le&s;s Convexity of the Bodies them|&s;elves: Thus when the Eye is too flat, as in old People, (from a Decay of the Humors, or a Shrinking of the Coats, or both) the converging Rays do not coale&s;ce at the <HI>Re|tina;</HI> but would pa&s;s on if &s;uffer'd, and not come to a Point but at &s;ome Di&s;tance beyond it: By this Means Vi&s;ion becomes weak and indi&s;tinct.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="34">
<P>On the contrary, tho&s;e call'd <HI>Myopes,</HI> or Near-&s;ighted People, have their Eyes too gibbous, and the Convexity of them is &s;o great, that the Rays meet and cro&s;s one a|nother before they arrive at the <HI>Retina.</HI> The former Eyes are help'd by Convex-Gla&s;&s;es, which put the Rays into a State of ea&s;ie Re|fraction before they fall upon the Eye: The latter are help'd by Concave-Gla&s;&s;es, thro' which the Rays pa&s;&s;ing do diverge, and fall upon the Eye in &s;uch a Manner, as to re|quire a greater Degree of Refraction than they would in their natural Cour&s;e: In the former Ca&s;e the Eye is not help'd by the Object's appearing bigger, but more di&s;tinct; for very &s;mall Objects are render'd di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible to &s;uch an Eye by the Help of a Con|vex-Gla&s;s, whereas very large ones cannot be &s;een enough to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Na|ked Eye.</P>
<P>I don't propo&s;e to give any new Theory of Vi&s;ion, nor to be able to de&s;cribe the Man|ner of it better than 'tis already done by an eminent Author; for which Rea&s;on I &s;hall make u&s;e of his own Words, &s;o far as they are &s;erviceable to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and
<PB N="37" REF="35">conducive to the main End of this Treati&s;e, which is to a&s;certain the True PLACE of a <HI>Cataract.</HI></P>
<P>All the Rays which come from one Point of an Object, are by the <HI>Cornea</HI> and Humors of the Eye united in a Point of the <HI>Retina,</HI> which is in a &s;treight Line, drawn from the &s;ame Point of the Object, thro' the Center of the Eye; and con&s;equently all the Rays, which come from all the Points of an Object, are united on the <HI>Retina,</HI> in the &s;ame Order and Proportion as the Points of the Objects are from whence tho&s;e Rays come.</P>
<P>Therefore the Interpo&s;ition which the&s;e Rays make upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> mu&s;t be the Image of the Object.</P>
<P>And thus Vi&s;ion in general is perform'd: But to know what the &s;everal Parts of the Globe contribute hereunto, it's needful to ob&s;erve that the <HI>Cornea</HI> is more convex than any other Part of it; by which Means all the Rays are gather'd to pa&s;s thro' the <HI>Pu|pilla,</HI> and none of them are lo&s;t upon the <HI>Uvea.</HI></P>
<PB N="38" REF="36">
<P>The <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor being thinne&s;t, and mo&s;t liquid, ea&s;ily changes its Figure, when either the <HI>Ligamentum Ciliare</HI> contracts, or both the Oblique Mu&s;cles &s;queeze the Mid|dle of the Bulb of the Eye, to render it ob|long, when Objects are too near us.</P>
<P>The &s;treight Fibres of the <HI>Uvea</HI> dilate the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> when there are but few Rays of Light; and the circular Fibres contract it, when there are too many.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Pupilla</HI> is contracted, we &s;ee mo&s;t di&s;tinctly; when it is dilated, we &s;ee mo&s;t clearly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gla&s;&s;y</HI> Humor keeps the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from the <HI>Retina,</HI> as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for uniting the Rays, which come from one Point of the Object, exactly in one Point of the <HI>Retina.</HI> The Impre&s;&s;ion of the Object is made upon the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Choroides</HI> is tinctur'd black, that the Rays of Light which pa&s;s thro' the <HI>Retina</HI> may not be reflected back again to confu&s;e the Image of the Object.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="37">
<P>Being di&s;tinct, Vi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts in the Union of all the Rays which come from one Point of an Object exactly in one Point of the <HI>Re|tina;</HI> and that the Rays which come from Objects at different Di&s;tances, are united at different Di&s;tances, behind the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Hu|mor; they cannot both be exactly united up|on the <HI>Retina,</HI> therefore the Eye cannot &s;ee equally di&s;tinct, at the &s;ame Time, Ob|jects at different Di&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Optick Nerves pierce the Globe of the Eye, a little on the In&s;ide of the Optick <HI>Axes.</HI> Their external Coat, which is a Production of the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> is continu'd to the <HI>Sclerotis,</HI> as their internal from the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> is to the <HI>Choroides;</HI> and their medullary Fibres pa&s;&s;ing thro' all, are expan|ded into the <HI>Retina,</HI> upon which the Images of Objects are painted.</P>
<P>The Center of this Expan&s;ion is in&s;en&s;ible, and all Rays which fall upon it are lo&s;t; and con&s;equently that Point of the Object from which tho&s;e Rays come, is invi&s;ible to the Eye: The Rea&s;on of which proceeds proba|bly from the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, which enter with
<PB N="40" REF="38">the Optick Nerve, and cover this Part of the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>But what&s;oever its Cau&s;e is, there is a ma|nife&s;t Advantage in the Optick Nerves being in&s;erted on the In&s;ide of the Optick <HI>Axes:</HI> For if they had pierc'd the Eye in the <HI>Axis,</HI> then the middle Point of every Object had been invi&s;ible; and where all Things con|duce to make us &s;ee be&s;t, there we had not &s;een at all.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t likewi&s;e have lo&s;t &s;ome Part of an Object, if the Optick Nerves had been placed on the Out&s;ide of the Optick <HI>Axes:</HI> Becau&s;e an Object may be &s;o placed, as that all the Rays which come from one Point, may fall upon the Out&s;ide of both Eyes: But it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould fall upon the In&s;ide of both Eyes; and therefore that Point which is lo&s;t in one Eye, is vi&s;ible by the other.</P>
<P>This &s;hall &s;erve for the general The|ory of VISION: I &s;hall now come to &s;peak of a few Di&s;ea&s;es of the Eye, by which Vi&s;ion is render'd incompleat, or to|tally
<PB N="41" REF="39">de&s;troy'd: And fir&s;t of the CATA|RACT.</P>
<P>Before I define a <HI>Cataract,</HI> 'twill be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a few Things, in Order to clear the Way for my Definition: For &s;ince the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> I go upon is New, and not yet clearly demon&s;trated, it would be look'd upon as a &s;trange Peice of Pre&s;umption to overlook in the Gro&s;s all the different Obje|ctions which may be made again&s;t it, and &s;a|tisfie my&s;elf with only a few Probabilities (collected out of my own little Experience and Ob&s;ervation) which may &s;eem to make for it.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> I. 'Tis Demon&s;trated by the Mathematicians, that neither Corpu&s;cles in the <HI>Aqueous</HI> or <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor can be per|ceiv'd on the <HI>Retina;</HI> and 'tis &s;aid by Phy&s;i|cians, that a Beginning of a <HI>Cataract</HI> is a Suffu&s;ion of the Eye, when little Clouds, Motes, and Flies, &s;eem to float about in the Air: Now if the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions are both true, one would be apt to conclude, that neither the <HI>Aqueous</HI> nor <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor can be the Seat of a <HI>Cataract:</HI> The fir&s;t is indi&s;|putable,
<PB N="42" REF="40">but the latter is not always True in Fact.</P>
<P>For I have known a good Number of Subject with real Confirm'd <HI>Cataracts,</HI> who never remember to have been thus af|fected at the Beginning of them.</P>
<P>And altho' &s;ome at the Beginning of <HI>Ca|taracts</HI> are thus affected, 'tis no Proof that the Di&s;ea&s;e may not be in one or the other of the&s;e Humors: For the &s;ame Cau&s;e which will produce a <HI>Cataract,</HI> may at the &s;ame Time the <HI>Cataract</HI> is forming affect al&s;o the Fund of the Eye; and by di&s;ordering the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, here and there &s;top the Influx of the Animal Spirits into the little Filaments of the Optick Nerve which help to make the <HI>Retina.</HI> This will certainly produce them Clouds, Motes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And I have the more Rea&s;on to believe this, becau&s;e I have Couch'd &s;everal who af|ter the <HI>Cataract</HI> has been well &s;uppre&s;t, have remain'd blind with a <HI>Gutta Serena;</HI> which is, I &s;uppo&s;e, a total Stoppage of the Influx of the Animal Spirits into the nervous Filaments afore-mention'd.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="41">
<P><HI>Objection</HI> II. 'Tis &s;uppos'd, that without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor there could be no Vi&s;ion; that is, except that Hu|mor lay always ready to receive the Rays and refract them after they had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> they would &s;till proceed with &s;o &s;mall a Degree of Refraction that their Place of Converging would be beyond the <HI>Retina;</HI> and by Con&s;equence Vi&s;ion would be render'd very indi&s;tinct, or perhaps the Eye would only perceive a confu&s;s'd Glare of Light; if this Humor was taken away, and this could be demon&s;trated, 'twould not de&s;troy my Suppo&s;ition: For I freely acknowledge, that after the Removal of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> (or the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor, which as I proceed I &s;hall u&s;e &s;ynonymou&s;ly) Vi|&s;ion is never &s;o perfectly perform'd as it was before the Eye was di&s;eas'd.</P>
<P>And if the Subjects I have hitherto per|form'd the Operation upon were of Con&s;i|deration enough to have given me Pains beyond my Needle, I make no Doubt but I could have fix'd them with Gla&s;&s;es which would have &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;ted their Sight, and
<PB N="44" REF="42">made them &s;ome Amends for the Lo&s;s of the afore&s;aid Humor.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> III. If Vi&s;ion can be perform'd without this Humor, and the Maxim is true <HI>Quod Natura Nihil agit fru&s;tra,</HI> Why was it placed in the Eye?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, 'Tis placed there to enable the Eye to &s;ee equally well at different Di&s;tan|ces: For &s;ince the Rays proceeding from the luminous Points of nigh Objects diverge more than tho&s;e from more remote Objects, the Power of making them equally converge at the <HI>Retina</HI> is very probably lodg'd in the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor; which, according to the different Di&s;tances of Objects, approaches nigher to, or removes farther from the <HI>Re|tina,</HI> and perhaps too a&s;&s;umes a different Convexity.</P>
<P>And this I look upon to be unque&s;tiona|ble: Becau&s;e I have made it my con&s;tant Ob|&s;ervation, That after a &s;ucce&s;sful Depre&s;&s;ure of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> the Patient &s;ees be&s;t at a Di&s;tance &s;omething greater than the Eye re|quires when all its Parts are in their natural
<PB N="45" REF="43">Situation; and that if the Object is placed con&s;iderably further from, or nearer to the Eye, Vi&s;ion is render'd indi&s;tinct or confus'd.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> IV. But if the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor is depre&s;s'd, what becomes of it afterwards? And how is the Cavity fill'd up, which the &s;aid Humor po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in its natural Situation?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> When I pa&s;s my Needle into the Eye, I pre&s;s directly forward to the <HI>Cry&s;tal|line</HI> Humor, and endeavouring to di&s;engage it from the <HI>Ligamentum Ciliare,</HI> I depre&s;s it to the Bottom of the <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor; when the <HI>Pupilla</HI> immediately &s;eems clear to me, and &s;uch a Torrent of confus'd Light ru&s;hes into the Eye, as &s;ometimes affrights the Pa|tient even more than the Puncture of the Needle.</P>
<P>Common Sen&s;e tells us, That if a &s;olid Body which is immers'd in a Fluid &s;hould be remov'd from one Part of that Fluid in|to another, it makes no Alteration in the Bulk of the Whole; for whatever Place the Solid is remov'd to, it fills up but &s;o much Space preci&s;ely as it did in the Space which it
<PB N="46" REF="44">was remov'd from. Immediately upon the Removal of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor, the <HI>A|queous</HI> turns in and fills up the Cavity.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> From the different Specifick Gravity of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor, which in all Pro|bability is different in different Stages of the Di&s;temper, we may account for what is call'd the Ri&s;ing again of the <HI>Cataract:</HI> As to what becomes of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor af|ter 'tis depre&s;s'd, 'tis not unlikely that being broke from the Ve&s;&s;els which nouri&s;h'd it, it &s;hrinks by Degrees, and as it were melts in|to the <HI>Vitreoeus.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Turner</HI> &s;ays, A <HI>Cataract</HI> is a Di&s;ea&s;e of the Eye, in which a Film or Skin grow|ing before the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> like a Curtain drawn again&s;t a Hole letting the Light into a Room, hinders the Pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame, till it is depre&s;s'd by the Needle, as in Couching.</P>
<P>There is no one of my Profe&s;&s;ion who pays a greater Veneration to the Authority of that worthy, learned, and ingenious Gentleman, than my&s;elf; I am beholden to him that I have a regular, methodical, and I may ven|ture
<PB N="47" REF="45">to &s;ay a certain Sy&s;tem of Surgery in my Head and Hand; but as he him&s;elf (who had always more Bu&s;ine&s;s in other Parts of Surgery than a Man of his &s;tudious Temper could well attend to) very rarely, if ever perform'd the Operation, I hope 'twill not be thought Pre|&s;umption if when I come to &s;peak of the Ope|ration it&s;elf, I &s;hould venture to give &s;ome Rea&s;ons which may &s;eem to thwart his Opi|nion, and e&s;tabli&s;h my own.</P>
<P>That there are &s;uch Films as the Doctor mentions on this Side the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> and in the <HI>Aqueous Humor,</HI> I can readily grant, having met with &s;everal of them in the little Cour&s;e of my Practice: The&s;e the Practitioners are al|low'd to call <HI>Suffu&s;ions, Films, &amp;c.</HI> but not <HI>Cataracts;</HI> for I am determin'd to call no Di&s;ea&s;e of the Eye by this latter Name, ex|cept that particular One which is to be re|medied by the U&s;e of the Needle: But the, Ca&s;e as mention'd by the Doctor can receive no Benefit that I know of by the Operation, nor did I ever attempt to Couch a Patient (tho' I have had &s;everal offer'd me) when the Circum&s;tances were as before-mention'd: This I &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate, in de&s;cri|bing the Operation it&s;elf.</P>

<P>The <HI>French</HI> Authors, with <HI>Vaughion</HI> at the Head of them, imagine a <HI>Cataract</HI> to be a Film &s;eparated from the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor, and floating in tine <HI>Aqueous;</HI> that all its Parts are exi&s;tent in its fir&s;t Conformation, that it is a <HI>Cy&s;tis,</HI> and that <HI>Cy&s;ti&s;&s;es</HI> are never form'd <HI>de novo,</HI> but are only Membranes di&s;engag'd from the neighbouring Parts, which increa|&s;ing in Thickne&s;s receive Nouri&s;hment from the Parts to which they adhere.</P>

<P>According to this Account, any thing which thickens the <HI>Cornea,</HI> or makes the <HI>Aqueous</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="49">Humor dark and cloudy, may be term'd a <HI>Cataract;</HI> for he &s;eems to u&s;e the Word <HI>Ca|taract</HI> not as any particular Di&s;ea&s;e, but only as &s;omething which &s;hall darken and ob&s;cure the Sight, by hindring the Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Rays of Light. Thus the <HI>Albugo, Pterygium, Hyopyon,</HI> or the Vi&s;cidity of the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor, frequently con&s;equent upon an <HI>Oph|thalmia,</HI> may be ju&s;tly deem'd a <HI>Cataract.</HI> But how this &s;quares with the real Notion of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and its Cure, I &s;hall leave my Readers after a few Pages to determine.</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing over all the different Definitions and Surmi&s;es of others, I &s;hall take the Li|berty (for Rea&s;ons which I &s;hall give after|wards) to define it in the following Manner.</P>
<P>A <HI>Cataract</HI> is a Di&s;ea&s;e of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor, whereby the &s;aid Humor is totally or at lea&s;t one Side of it render'd opake: The Humor in this di&s;eas'd State reflect all or mo&s;t of the Rays of Light, in&s;tead of tran&s;|mitting them to the <HI>Retina;</HI> in Con&s;equence of which, the Humor appears whiti&s;h, blui&s;h, yellowi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Eye is blind.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="52" REF="50">
<HEAD>CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>Any Blow or Shock, which may alter the particular Po&s;ition of the Particles of which this Humor is compos'd: for to make a Body diaphanous, 'tis not only nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be made of &s;uch particular Particles, but that tho&s;e Particles &s;hould be combin'd and united after a particular Manner. Thus Salts, wet Paper, or the <HI>Oculus Mundi</HI> Stone, grow opake by being dried; Horn, by being &s;crap'd; Gla&s;s, by being reduc'd to Powder, or otherwi&s;e flaw'd; Turpentine, by being &s;tirr'd about with Water till they mix im|perfectly.</P>
<P>The Matter which is &s;eparated for the na|tural Nouri&s;hment of this Humor from the Blood, may from the too great Vi&s;cidity of the Blood it&s;elf, either be &s;eparated in too &s;mall a Quantity, (the Glands and Strainers of the&s;e Parts being exceeding fine) and by this Atro|phy the Humors may grow dry and opake, as Paper, Salts, <HI>Oculus Mundi</HI> Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or otherwi&s;e upon a Fever or <HI>Ophthalmia,</HI> the Ve&s;&s;els leading to this Humor may be &s;o enlarg'd, as to admit Particles of an improper
<PB N="53" REF="51">Figure or Magnitude: The Heterogeneous Particles, (if I may &s;o call them) in&s;tead of properly nouri&s;hing the Humor, may be lodg'd irregularly in its Pores, (as Water and Turpentine as above) and by de&s;troying that Equality which we are told is nece&s;&s;ary to Tran&s;parency, render the Humor opake.</P>
<P>It may be caus'd by violent Grief, which occa&s;ions a more than natural Secretion of Tears from an adjacent Part; this may from a Continuance make &s;o great a Revul&s;ion, that the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor may probably grow dry, or &s;uffer Diminution, for Want of its u&s;ual Supplies. I have Rea&s;ons to imagine this, becau&s;e in Eyes thus di&s;eas'd I have found this Humor much &s;maller than ordi|nary.</P>
<P>It may and often does proceed from an un|skillful Treating of the Eye in an <HI>Ophthal|mia,</HI> whil&s;t there is a more than ordinary Flux of Matter upon the Parts which &s;eems to in|treat a Pa&s;&s;age thro' the Coats: In&s;tead of al|luring it forwards by kind Di&s;cutients, I have too frequently known it drove back by cold Repellents; and by lodging it&s;elf in the Coats
<PB N="54" REF="52">and Humors of the Eye, at once deprive it of its U&s;e and Beauty.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Pitcarn,</HI> in &s;peaking of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Some a&s;cribe it to the thickning or co|agulating of the</HI> Aqueous <HI>Humor, and others to that of the</HI> Cry&s;talline: <HI>But the&s;e know No|thing of the Nature of the Eye; for Corpu&s;|cles floating in the</HI> Aqueous <HI>or</HI> Cry&s;talline <HI>Humo, can't be prerceiv'd on the</HI> Retina.</P>
<P>For once I'll run the Ri&s;que of having my Under&s;tanding cen&s;ur'd, and venture to &s;ay. That tho' the Corpu&s;cles them&s;elves are not &s;een being within the Eye, yet they can hin|der the Eye from di&s;cerning every di&s;tinct Part of any Object which is without it: And the&s;e little Specks of Darkne&s;s, amid&s;t a Glare of Light, are mi&s;taken by the Patient for Some|thing po&s;itive, when they are only Privations; and the Effect would be the &s;ame, if there were any Stoppages in the &s;mall nervous Fi|laments which compo&s;e the <HI>Retina.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Doctor's Philo&s;ophy is true, when he &s;ays they can't be &s;een, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if he would pretend to inferr from thence, that they can
<PB N="55" REF="53">be no Cau&s;es why the Eye can't &s;ee other Things, his Con&s;equence is fal&s;e; and clearly demon&s;trated to be &s;o, by Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> at the End of his ANATOMY.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t temperate Sea&s;ons are the be&s;t, for which Rea&s;on I make Choice of <HI>Spring</HI> or <HI>Autumn.</HI> 'Tis requi&s;ite the Day &s;hould be fine and clear, and the Light well cho&s;en. I oblige the Patient to recline his Head back|wards upon a Pillow, the Pillow is &s;upported by the Back of a Chair of a proper Heighth; behind the Patient an A&s;&s;i&s;tant is plac'd, to keep his Head without Motion; 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary too for a Per&s;on on each Side, to &s;ecure the Hands of the Patient; for I have &s;een very ill Con&s;equences attend the Neglect
<PB N="57" REF="55">of this: Having thus prepar'd the Patient, I place my&s;elf on a Stool, rais'd by Pillows ac|cording to the Heighth of the Subject, till I have a full Command of the Patient's EYE; then bidding him turn his Eye towards his No&s;e, &s;o that the <HI>Tunica Conjunctiva</HI> may be &s;ufficiently apparent, I plunge my Needle directly into the <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor, thro' the <HI>Tunica Conjunctiva,</HI> about the Di&s;tance of the Tenth Part of an Inch from the <HI>Cornea;</HI> then thru&s;ting it boldly to the upper Part of the <HI>Cry&s;talline,</HI> gently turn the flat Part of my Needle on the Top of the <HI>Cataract;</HI> by which Means I have a greater Surface upon it, and the <HI>Cataract</HI> con&s;equently le&s;s liable to &s;lip from under my Needle: I depre&s;s it ve|ry &s;lowly, and place it as I think at the Bot|tom of the <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor; I don't immedi|ately remove my Needle off it, but continue it depre&s;s'd for about Half a Minute, for Rea|&s;ons which I &s;hall give when I come to &s;peak of the Cau&s;es of a <HI>Cataract</HI>'s ri&s;ing again: After this, I draw my Needle back about the Sixth Part of an Inch; and gently rai&s;ing the Point, take it quite out of the EYE.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Regimen</HI> after the Operation.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after the Operation I apply a Repellant Compre&s;s, and order the Patient to be put to Bed, rai&s;ing his Head &s;omething higher than u&s;ual; and after &s;uffering of him to remain quiet a few Hours, I renew my dre&s;|&s;ing, and begin to treat him with a cool <HI>Re|gimen,</HI> proper Diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as in a &s;ymptoma|tical Fever: This I do to &s;econd the Inten|tion of the former <HI>Regimen;</HI> notwith&s;tanding which, an <HI>Ophthalmia</HI> in Spite of all I can do will &s;ometimes &s;upervene, and then it mu&s;t be treated as &s;uch.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Ophthalmia's</HI> are &s;ometimes &s;o vio|lent as to become difficult of Cure, and of|ten produce all the Effects, and perhaps too really bring that Di&s;temper upon the Eye call'd <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI> This la&s;t mention'd Di|&s;ea&s;e is &s;eated on the <HI>Retina,</HI> and may be brought on by any Thing which will enlarge the Capillary Arteries of that Membrane; for they lying contiguous to the Nerves, and their Diameters being increas'd, the interme|diate Nerves are &s;o pre&s;s'd betwixt them, that the Influx of the Animal Spirits is intirely pro|hibited,
<PB N="59" REF="57">and all Commumication is cut off be|twixt them and the Original of the Optick Nerves in the Brain, which is the <HI>Commune Sen&s;orium:</HI> Thus tho' the <HI>Cataract</HI> conti|nues well depre&s;s'd, and the Eye in all Appea|rance perfectly clear, yet the Patient will re|main Blind, and 'tis too often beyond the Reach of Art to give him any A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>However, I generally u&s;e all the Evacu|ations proper in a &s;tubborn <HI>Ophthalmia,</HI> with Calomel, Purgatives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and keep the Pa|tient to an attenuating Diet; obliging him to ab&s;tain from all vi&s;cid Nutriments, and to u&s;e much Exerci&s;e: This Method I have known to meet with its de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>There are many other Cau&s;es be&s;ides this Common One, which may render the Ope|ration un&s;ucce&s;sful; fir&s;t, the Ri&s;ing again of the <HI>Cataract.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cataract</HI> will &s;ometimes ri&s;e again, even before the Needle is out of the Eye: There are many &s;pecious Rea&s;ons to be a&s;|&s;ign'd for it, tho' perhaps none of them true; however I &s;hall mention what I have hitherto
<PB N="60" REF="58">imagin'd, not without a Promi&s;e to correct any Thing I &s;hall here &s;ay if I find it con|tradicted by future Practice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Rea&s;on (which is perhaps more obvious to others than my&s;elf) is, That the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor being di&s;eas'd, is become &s;pecifically lighter than the <HI>Vitreous;</HI> and that being di&s;engag'd from the Membranes to which it in &s;ome Mea&s;ure adhered, and de|pre&s;s'd to the Bottom of the <HI>Vitreous,</HI> upon Removal of the Needle it a&s;cends by its own &s;pecifick Levity, and places it&s;elf at or near the Place from whence it was remov'd.</P>
<P>The next is, That con&s;i&s;ting of very gluti|nous Parts, and being join'd perhaps to the <HI>Uvea,</HI> the Needle only removes the main Body, which &s;till remains attach'd to the <HI>Uvea</HI> by certain &s;mall ela&s;tick Filaments; which as &s;oon as the Needle is remov'd con|tract them&s;elves, and again lift up the <HI>Cry|&s;talline</HI> Humor into its natural Po&s;ition.</P>
<P>If it remains depre&s;s'd for &s;ome Days and afterwards ri&s;es again, but being a &s;econd or third Time depre&s;s'd it continues where
<PB N="61" REF="59">you would place it, it may proceed from an increas'd Vi&s;cidity in the Humor it&s;elf, or from a Rarefaction of that Fluid into which it's immers'd; both of which will perhaps be con&s;equent upon an Inflammation, perhaps from an Ela&s;ticity in the <HI>Cornea,</HI> whereby the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor may be immediately thru&s;t into its Place by Removal of the <HI>Cry&s;talline;</HI> which Ela&s;ticity and Contraction of the <HI>Cor|nea,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be too great to be overcome by the diffrent &s;pecifick Gravity of the <HI>Cry|&s;talline.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, if I was to give my Opinion of the general Cau&s;e of the Ri&s;ing again of the <HI>Cataract</HI> immediately upon its being depre&s;s'd, I &s;hould imagine it to be the lifting up the Point of the Needle before I withdraw it very near back again to the Place from whence I remov'd the <HI>Cataract.</HI> For I imagine that the &s;pecifick Gravity of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor, (being very little different if at all from that of the <HI>Vitreous</HI>) would ne|ver be &s;ufficient to overcome the Re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;aid <HI>Vitreous</HI> Humor, which is a very vi&s;cid and tenacious Fluid, unle&s;s there was a Pa&s;&s;age made for it to ri&s;e again by that
<PB N="62" REF="60">Motion of the Needle which I have ju&s;t now ex|pre&s;s'd; and therefore hold it nece&s;&s;ary that after the <HI>Cataract</HI> is depre&s;s'd, the Needle ought to be kept &s;ome Time upon it, that the Fluid above it may have Time perfectly to reunite; &s;o as becoming all over equally tenacious, it may be impower'd to keep the <HI>Cataract</HI> in the Po&s;ition we would have it.</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e of ill Succe&s;s is, the woun|ding the <HI>Uvea</HI> or <HI>Iris;</HI> the Con&s;equence of which will be an irregular Form of the <HI>Pu|pilla,</HI> &s;ome of which I have &s;een intirely clos'd: However if they are not &s;o, there is al|ways &s;uch a Callo&s;ity upon the wounded Membrane, as &s;tops up the <HI>Pupilla</HI> in one Part, and leaves &s;uch an Opening of it on the other, that by &s;topping up the Rays where they &s;hould pa&s;s, and &s;uffering them to pa&s;s where they &s;hould not, the Eye is render'd intirely u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e Parts too, when wounded, &s;ome|times ulcerate; by which Ulceration, the whole Coats and Humors of the Eye become one common Ma&s;s of <HI>Pus,</HI> and the Eye in|tirely &s;inks.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="61">
<P>The Rea&s;on that a Per&s;on is oblig'd to wound the <HI>Uvea</HI> and <HI>Iris</HI> is, when he would endeavour to remove a Film which lies in the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor, or on this Side the <HI>Pupilla.</HI> And this, till I know better, I &s;hall call an <HI>Injudicious Practice.</HI></P>
<P>It often happens that the &s;aid Coats are wounded thro' the Fault of the Patient, even when the Operation is the mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly performed; for he not havingCourage to keep his Eye in the Po&s;ition he was directed, and by endeavouring to fly from the Pain which is given by the fir&s;t Puncture of the Needle, which he imagines is only to be done by Mo|tion, and not being able to move his Eye any farther towards the great <HI>Canthus,</HI> turns it back again&s;t the Point or Edge of the Needle; and by this Means, in Spite of all the Art or Addre&s;s of the Surgeon, will with that Mo|tion wound the Coats above-mention'd: But this la&s;t Accident does not happen to a Man who knows what he is doing, perhaps above Once in Twenty Times.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on of ill Succe&s;s is, the <HI>Cata|ract</HI> proving Milky: To be able to deter|mine
<PB N="64" REF="62">mine whether 'tis &s;o or not before I touch it with my Needle I have not yet learn'd, and &s;hould be glad to be inform'd by any Body who has.</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e of ill Succe&s;s, which is al&s;o &s;ometimes attributed to the Surgeon, may be a &s;trange Fondne&s;s of Sight, which engages the Patient after having been couch'd Three or Four Days to pull off the Dre&s;&s;ings in the Ab&s;ence of the Surgeon; by which he expo|&s;ing the Eye to the A&s;&s;aults of the open Air, brings on that <HI>Ophthalmia</HI> which we were endeavouring to prevent: In this Ca&s;e he him|&s;elf is blamable, and not the Surgeon, for all the ill Con&s;equences that may attend it, one of which I have found often to be the intire Lo&s;s of Sight.</P>
<P>Another Misfortune, which too frequently attends the unhappy Patient, is, when the <HI>Ca|taract</HI> is accompanied with a <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> perhaps of as long &s;tanding as the <HI>Cataract</HI> it&s;elf; this we find when upon depre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Cataract,</HI> (and there's no Po&s;&s;ibility of judg|ing of it before) and the <HI>Pupilla</HI> remaining clear, the Patient notwith&s;tanding continues
<PB N="65" REF="63">in total Darkne&s;s: This Ca&s;e is indeed de|plorable. I &s;hould be unwilling to think that there was any Part of Mankind &s;uch Strangers to common Sen&s;e, as to imagine this to be a Fault of the Surgeon; but, I my&s;elf have more than once been calumnia|ted on this very Account: I can't help &s;ay|ing, I have been unfairly dealt with by &s;ome of the Gentlemen of my own Profe&s;&s;ion, who have mi&s;repre&s;ented the Ca&s;es, and deluded the common People, as well as injured me; this was the Ca&s;e of Three Subjects that I lately Couch'd in <HI>Yarmouth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I have met with the &s;ame Treat|ment on Account of a Subject which I Cut for the Stone, where I will undertake to de|mon&s;trate to any Man in <HI>England,</HI> that it was as impo&s;&s;ible to meet with Succe&s;s in that Operation as it was circum&s;tanc'd, as it is to &s;ucceed in the Operation of Couching where the <HI>Cataract</HI> is attended with a <HI>Gutta Serena;</HI> for unle&s;s a Man could directly look into the Body in the one Ca&s;e, or down to the Bottom of the Eye in the other, he can be no more able to make a po&s;itive Progno|&s;tick, than he would be to alter the Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="64">
<P>I &s;hall make here another Ob&s;ervation, That where there is a <HI>Cataract</HI> in one Eye and the other Eye &s;ound and good, the Pa|tient don't ought to be encourag'd to &s;uffer the di&s;eas'd Eye to be Couch'd; becau&s;e the Symptoms which may po&s;&s;ibly attend it, may be the Occa&s;ion of the Lo&s;s of both.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the Liberty of mentioning a Ca&s;e of my own, wherein I have met with &s;ome of the afore-mention'd Accidents. A|bout Five Months &s;ince, a Patient came to me with a Confirm'd <HI>Cataract</HI> in one Eye, and a Suffu&s;ion in the other. I found the <HI>Ca|taract</HI> good, and (after the common Prepa|rations) depre&s;s'd it with no apparent ill Ac|cident. The Eye continu'd clear, and the Patient &s;aw for &s;ome Days: At which Time an Inflammation came on, which equally af|fected both Eyes; and, notwith&s;tanding all I could do to abate it, the Coats and Hu|mors were &s;o thicken'd by it, that the Eye which had the Suffu&s;ion in it became totally blind: And &s;ome Time after, that which I had couch'd was in like Manner intirely de|priv'd of Sight; tho' the <HI>Cataract</HI> remain depre&s;s'd, and the <HI>Pupilla</HI> perfectly clear.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="65">
<P><HI>Ob&s;ervation.</HI> It &s;eems pretty plain, That the Suffu&s;ion above-mention'd was Nothing more than the Beginning of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> cau|&s;ed by the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor growing thick and muddy: And that this Inflammation, by increa&s;ing the Vi&s;cidity of the Matter &s;epara|ted for the Nouri&s;hment of the &s;aid Humor, increas'd the Thickne&s;s &s;o, as to render the Humor intirely opake; or in other Terms, ripen'd the <HI>Cataract.</HI> The Rea&s;on why I did not venture to Couch it afterwards was, an uncommon Dilatation of the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> which had been from the Beginning of the Suffu&s;ion: The Di&s;ea&s;e of the other was a direct <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> caus'd by the Inflammation in the Manner before de&s;erib'd.</P>
<P>The Subject I have been treating of being altogether new, I &s;hall beg Leave to add the following Queries, to be con&s;ider'd by the Gentlemen of my Profe&s;&s;ion, not troubling my&s;elf whether they make for or again&s;t my <HI>Hypothe&s;is.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> I. Whether the Rea&s;on of the Dila|ation of the <HI>Pupilla</HI> in one Eye and not the her may not be this: That the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI>

In &s;uch a Dilatation as I here mention, we can't promi&s;e any great Succe&s;s from the U&s;e of the Needle: For was the Humor it&s;elf perfectly clear, &s;uch a dila|ted <HI>Pupilla</HI> would admit &s;uch a Glare and Flow of Rays to the <HI>Retina,</HI> as would ren|der Vi&s;ion confus'd and indi&s;tinct; much le&s;s can we hope to have a good Eye, when that Humor &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Vi&s;ion is intirely re|moved.</P>

<P><HI>Query</HI> V. Whether our not being able to remove a <HI>Cataract</HI> at its fir&s;t Appearance, is not a Proof that 'tis not the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Hu|mor? Becau&s;e for all what we know certain|ly, the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor is equally remo|vable at all Times.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> VI. Whether or no in that Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e which we call a <HI>Milky Cata|ract,</HI> there may not be &s;uch a Solution of Continuity of the Parts of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Hu|mor, as may &s;uffer the Needle to pa&s;s back|wards and forwards in it, without being able to remove it out of its Place?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> VII. And whether in a farther Stage of this Di&s;ea&s;e, the Parts may not again clo&s;e, and &s;tick together in &s;uch a Manner, as that the whole Body of the Humor may be at once remov'd, by only pre&s;&s;ing upon a parti|cular Part of it?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> VIII. Whether there may not be a Gradation of Colouring &s;ettled from Sir <HI>I&s;aac
<PB N="71" REF="69">Newton's</HI> Theory, beginning at a light Blue and ending at a greeni&s;h Yellow; whereby we might be able to determine the exact Age of a <HI>Cataract,</HI> as &s;oon as we &s;ee it? And whether &s;uch a particular Colour will or will not &s;ucce&s;sfully bear the Needle?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> IX. Whether 'tis not po&s;&s;ible to in|vent a <HI>Speculum Oculi,</HI> which may keep the Globe of the Eye without Motion, and with|out giving that Pain to the Patient which too frequently contributes to the bringing on of an Inflammation? I mention this, becau&s;e I have &s;een &s;o many Inconveniencies attend the U&s;e of the Common <HI>Speculum Oculi;</HI> that, ra|ther than u&s;e it my&s;elf, I have cho&s;e to have Nothing to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, except the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Thumb and Finger?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> X. Whether a Trembling, which I have ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Aqueous</HI> Humor &s;ome Time after Couching, does not proceed from a Lo&s;s of Part of that Humor in Couching? And whether this Trembling is one Rea&s;on why the Rays of Light pa&s;s confus'd into the Eye?</P>
<PB N="72" REF="70">
<P><HI>Query</HI> XI. Whether there is Room for the Needle to pa&s;s between the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Hu|mor and the <HI>Uvea,</HI> without removing the former &s;o as to &s;poil the Eye, or cutting or lacerating the latter?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> XII. Whether, if this la&s;t is practi|cable, there's not a Po&s;&s;ibility of removing a Film that may be in the Forepart of the <HI>Pu|pilla,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Needle enters in at the Backpart of it?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> XIII. Whether there might not be a nice Experiment made, by placing an Eye like a <HI>Lens</HI> in the Hole of a dark Chamber? I think (if I remember rightly) I have met with the following Account in an Author of Experimental Philo&s;ophy. Stripping the Fund of the Eye of its Integuments, he plac'd it as above-mention'd; and holding a Peice of white Paper within the Room, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the Eye, he di&s;tinctly percei|ved the Images of all Objects from without painted upon the Paper; as they would have been upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> if the Eye had been in its natural Po&s;ition.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="71">
<P>Had a nice Hand been there who would have gon on the Out&s;ide and with a Needle as in Couching depre&s;s'd the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Hu|mor, and if notwith&s;tanding this Depre&s;&s;ion the Per&s;on within could &s;till perceive the I|mages as before, it would be a certain Proof that the Eye might &s;ee, notwith&s;tanding the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Cry&s;talline</HI> Humor.</P>
<P>The Eye &s;hould be taken down, and di&s;&s;e|cted; and by ob&s;erving in what Part the <HI>Cry|&s;talline</HI> Humor after its Removal was lodg'd, we &s;hould receive a great Light into the Theory of Couching, and much Satisfaction, as to the Truth of this <HI>Hypothe&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>I only mention this as it &s;eems to me po&s;|&s;ible, without being able to determine whe|ther 'tis practicable or not.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>Before I conclude, I thought it my Duty to mention, (and in the Words of a Great Man) That as a candid and &s;incere Beha|viour ought to be preferr'd to all other Con|&s;iderations, I would not let my Heart re|proach
<PB N="74" REF="72">me with a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having gain'd even the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Prai&s;e, which is not in every Particular my Right: I therefore thought proper to acknowledge, that I am oblig'd to a very ingenious Gentle|man (whom I have the Honour to be ac|quainted with) for Two or Three Hints that he has given me in the latter Part of this &s;hort Di&s;&s;ertation, which otherwi&s;e pro|bably might have been omitted.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> I believe it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve to &s;uch Per&s;ons as are not Judges of the Subject I have been treating of, That I have therein demon&s;trated the Rea&s;on of my not meeting with Succe&s;s in &s;ome Patients that I have Couch'd, particularly in <HI>Yarmouth.</HI></P>
