<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_A</HI> Man who offers to the World any thing not be|fore known, or not ge|nerally under&s;tood, mu&s;t expect to meet with two &s;orts of Adver&s;aries; who won't fail to a&s;|&s;ault him, tho they are as incon&s;i&s;|tent with each other, as with the Truth: that is to &s;ay, &s;ome Peo|ple will deny the Invention as either not practicable, or not u&s;eful; whil&s;t others at the &s;ame time, who are convinc'd of the Worth of it, will tell you, that it was long before
<PB N="vi" REF="5">known and practis'd, and that you mu&s;t not challenge to your &s;elf the Glory. Thus our Immortal <HI>Har|vey,</HI> when he happily di&s;cover'd the Circulation of the Blood, was at|tack'd on both &s;ides; and tho I won't pretend to compare what I here offer with his noble Di&s;covery, yet it won't he de&s;pis'd when it's con&s;ider'd that the Circulation of the Blood is a Speculation not &s;o immediately u&s;e|ful as what you have in the follow|ing Sheets, which is to re&s;cue Men in the Agony of Death.</P>
<P>They who &s;ay the opening an Ar|tery is not to be practis'd but in ex|traordinary Ca&s;es, own it to be a Remedy when all others fail, but at the &s;ame time would not have it practis'd till all Remedies are too late.</P>
<P>They who &s;ay this is an Operation us'd of old, won't, I hope, quarrel
<PB N="vii" REF="6">with me for preferring the Antiquity of Truth before the Novelty of Er|ror; at lea&s;t I won't quarrel with them, being much more intent upon doing Service to Mankind, than ac|quiring Reputation to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>They who alledg that Evacuation by an Artery makes a greater Ex|pence of Spirits than by a Vein, will find them&s;elves &s;o fully confuted in the following Treati&s;e, that I need &s;ay nothing more here. In &s;hort, I take the great and &s;acred Rule of Phy&s;ick to be the Ob&s;ervation of Na|ture and her Dictates; <HI>Quo Na|tura tendit.</HI> Now I would ask my Adver&s;aries to produce one In|&s;tance where Nature ever reliev'd her &s;elf by a Vein; and if there he no In&s;tance of it, then to u&s;e that Ve&s;&s;el is to cro&s;s Nature. Thus we &s;ee that the va&s;t Quantity of Blood which often i&s;&s;ues from the No&s;e, as
<PB N="viii" REF="7">well as the great Di&s;charge by the Piles (as they are vulgarly call'd) is &s;till Arterial Blood. But the mo&s;t notable In&s;tance is the men&s;tru|ous Blood in Women, which &s;ome|times flows from 'em in Streams to an unknown Quantity, and is di&s;|charg'd from the Arteries in the <HI>Ute|rus</HI> and <HI>Vagina:</HI> whereas &s;hould it proceed from the Veins, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to &s;ub&s;i&s;t under it.</P>
<P>It is plain therefore that the Doc|trine I advance is agreeable to the Dictates of Nature; and if Nature be for me, I don't much care who is again&s;t me.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A</HI> NEW METHOD <HI>Of Curing APOPLEXIES, AND</HI> Other Di&s;tempers of the HEAD.</HEAD>
<P>_NOtwith&s;tanding the va|rious Treati&s;es that have been writ by learned and ingenious Men, as well antient as modern, on this Subject, which have been han|dled with the greate&s;t Accuratene&s;s as to the Theory; yet for the Me|thod
<PB N="2" REF="9">of treating it thro the whole Cour&s;e, particularly at its fir&s;t Ap|pearance, I find nothing writ more forreign from the Purpo&s;e: For by bleeding out of the Veins, and other u&s;ual Methods of Practice, they prey upon and exhau&s;t the animal Spirits, and confirm the Di&s;temper, rather than relieve the Patient.</P>
<P>But not to detain the Reader with the Mea&s;ures others have taken, and &s;till per&s;i&s;t in; I &s;hall only offer my own Thoughts, and the Method by which for &s;ome Years pa&s;t I've found &s;uch happy Succe&s;s, as well in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> as el&s;ewhere, confirm'd by a few Ob&s;ervations. Therefore without any further Introduction, I &s;hall ju&s;t de&s;cribe this Di&s;ea&s;e, and proceed.</P>
<P>'Tis then an Apoplexy when the Body is &s;uddenly depriv'd of the chief Animal Faculties, as well in|ternal as external, and all voluntary Motion, &s;o that the Animal Spirits are either deny'd a Pa&s;&s;age from the Brain, or an Entrance into it; the Ventricles or Pores of the Brain be|ing either compre&s;s'd from a Contu|&s;ion,
<PB N="3" REF="10">or ob&s;tructed from a Plethora, Poi&s;ons, Medicines endued with a Narcotic Faculty, which &s;o alter the Blood, Lymph, and other Fluids, as to render 'em unfit to pa&s;s freely thro the Arteries of the Brain, whereby, thro the violent Impetus of of the Heart, the Blood is &s;o wedg'd in, that it cau&s;es a Stagnation; and oftentimes Polypu&s;es are form'd in the Carotids, Sinus's, and Vertebral Arteries, &s;o that all the Spirits in|dulgent Nature can rally to &s;upport the Fabric, are detach'd to the Mu&s;|cles of the Thorax, to perform Re|&s;piration, without which the Patient is inevitably lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the Brain is the Seat of this Di&s;ea&s;e, 'twill not be at all im|proper to take notice of its Struc|ture, as well as its U&s;e, before I pro|ceed any farther. There are then two Sub&s;tances which con&s;titute the Brain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Cinericious, being the Exterior, call'd the Cortical; the inner, from its Whitene&s;s and Soft|ne&s;s, the Medullary: the former of which, according to <HI>Malpigius,</HI> is nothing but a Gland of the conglo|merate
<PB N="4" REF="11">kind, or a Heap of &s;mall o|val Glands contiguous with each o|ther; to each of which is affix'd an Artery that brings the Blood, by the means of which Glands the Mat|ter con&s;tituting the Animal Spirits, is &s;ecern'd from its purer and &s;ub|tler Parts: from hence the Veins carry back the refluent Blood, that's unfit for generating of Spirits; and then the Nerve, or Root of a Nerve, in which, as in an excretory Duct of a Gland, the Spirits ju&s;t now perfec|ted, are carry'd into the Medulla|ry Sub&s;tance, as a Storehou&s;e or Magazine, and from thence thro the whole nervous Sy&s;tem, for the Benefit of conveying Sen&s;e and Mo|tion to the Animal Oeconomy.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince not only the Corti|cal Sub&s;tance of the Brain, but the Medullary al&s;o, and even the Nerves them&s;elves are inter&s;pers'd with an infinite Number of exce&s;|&s;ive &s;mall Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; whatever cau&s;es an Ob&s;truction in them, or makes 'em too turgid, cau&s;es an Apo|plexy in &s;ome degree or other, by pre&s;&s;ing on the Nerves, and &s;o pre|venting
<PB N="5" REF="12">the Circulation of their Fluid.</P>
<P>To dimini&s;h then the Quantity of Blood from the Veins, is what all have had immediate recour&s;e to as their chief Refuge and A&s;ylum, either from the Frontal, Jugular, Cephalic, or Me|diana for a Revul&s;ion; whereas that is now exploded, the Laws of Cir|culation not admitting it: and if this did not an&s;wer their Expecta|tion, the Patient was given over as in a de&s;perate Ca&s;e; according to this of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> &s;peaking of an Apo|plexy, <HI>Venae &s;ectio, ni juvet, occi|det;</HI> or this of <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>Sanguinis detractio, vel oc|cidit, vel liberat.</HI> Which is enough to convince us how prejudicial &s;uch Evacuations from the Veins were found, and how uncertain the Prac|tice was ob&s;erv'd to be, even by the Antients; tho, for want of a better, it has unhappily been per&s;i&s;ted in to this pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>'Twas indeed in many Ca&s;es fre|quently us'd by the Antients, but now become &s;o much in vogue, that 'tis order'd almo&s;t on all Occa&s;ions,
<PB N="6" REF="13">except in Cachectic Per&s;ons, or tho&s;e grown Hydropical by impoveri&s;h'd Blood, Di&s;ea&s;es contracted by Hun|ger, Fatigue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Let the Ob&s;truction be where it will, tho at the Fingers end, open|ing a Vein mu&s;t relieve it. I can't indeed wonder that the Antients did it, being in a manner Strangers to A|natomy, and knowing nothing of the Circulation of the Blood: but &s;ince, by the indefatigable Indu&s;try of the Moderns, that Part of Learning is arriv'd to &s;uch Perfection, I admire there's not more notice taken of the Inconveniencies that attend Phlebo|tomy; but 'tis pa&s;t over as an Ope|ration to be attempted by any Per|&s;on, at any Sea&s;on, regard being on|ly had to the Strength of the Pa|tient, touching of the Nerve, Ten|don, or its Aponeuro&s;is.</P>
<P>But if by an Ob&s;truction, Apo|plexies, or any Di&s;temper incident to the Head is caus'd; to make a more copious Evacuation, and &s;peedy De|rivation, the Di&s;charge mu&s;t be made by opening the Jugulars: which O|peration falls &s;o far &s;hort of their
<PB N="7" REF="14">Intention, that it proves far more di&s;mal in its Con&s;equences; by &s;o much the more effectually confirm|ing the Ob&s;truction, by how much the nearer the Ligatures approach the Part affected.</P>
<P>Experienc'd Surgeons indeed will u&s;e no Ligature round the Neck, for fear of Suffocation in Apoplexies and Squinanceys but only let a Stander-by compre&s;s the Jugular, on the contrary &s;ide, with his Thumb, and fix their own ju&s;t be|low the Place where they de&s;ign their Aperture. But too many u&s;e Ligatures, and either apply the middle of the Fillet behind the Neck, the two Ends being brought before and twi&s;ted; or turn one End over one Clavicle, and under the contrary Ax|illa, and &s;o the two Ends are brought before and fa&s;tned: both which are very pernicious, particularly the lat|ter, which by pre&s;&s;ing on the Ax|illary Vein, &s;tops the refluent Blood; by which, be&s;ides confirming the Ob&s;truction, as before mention'd, Syncopes, Palpitations, Tremors, and the like are cau&s;ed: for what|ever
<PB N="8" REF="15">thwarts or cro&s;&s;es the circular Progre&s;s of the Blood, produces the&s;e Effects.</P>
<P>But even bleeding in the Arm, the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Operation is &s;uch, and the Advantage that can be ex|pected from it &s;o &s;mall, I can by no means be reconcil'd to. For fir&s;t the Ligature mu&s;t be &s;train'd, in order to cau&s;e the Veins to &s;well, for the more commodious introducing the Lancet; which perhaps after all re|quires the Surgeon's Frictions, to force the Blood to the intended In|ci&s;ion: and this is not &s;ufficient, but often there mu&s;t be hot Cloaths, and the Arm plung'd in hot Water; and then when the Aperture is made, by the Mi&s;application of the Bandage, the Skin relaxes, the Orifice clo&s;es, and ob&s;tructs its Pa&s;&s;age: and when the Impetuo&s;ity of the Blood abates, the Ligature is again &s;lacken'd, that as much Blood may pa&s;s into that Part by the Arteries, as will &s;uffice for the intended Evacuation. During which time, the Ob&s;truction is con|firming; for the Blood in the Veins &s;teers an ea&s;y Cour&s;e from nar|rower
<PB N="9" REF="16">Pa&s;&s;ages to broader Channels, thro their &s;oft Tunicles, quite diffe|rent from tho&s;e of the Arteries; who&s;e Coats being ela&s;tic, parti|cularly in the large Trunks, give a Velocity to the Blood, which if in|tercepted, cau&s;es the Blood to be &s;o turgid in the capillary Ve&s;&s;els of the Brain, even to extrava&s;ate, and ob&s;tructs the Spirits in the <HI>Sen&s;orium Commune,</HI> the fir&s;t Cour&s;e of all Nervous Di&s;tempers; as Pal&s;ies, Cramps, Convul&s;ions, Apoplexies, Emaciations, and in&s;en&s;ible Decays, without any vi&s;ible Cau&s;e, that it would even po&s;e Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Judgment to account for it; as al&s;o that Chronical Di&s;temper, the <HI>Hy|drocephalus,</HI> or watry Humour in the Head, which proceeds from extrava|&s;ated Lymph, occa&s;ion'd by the Compre&s;&s;ion of the Lymphatics.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid will be &s;uffi|cient to convince any unprejudiced Per&s;on, of the Inconveniences that attend Phlebotomy. If we reflect on the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of this Operation, 'twill not much heighten our E&s;teem of it. <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his Natural Hi&s;tory,
<PB N="10" REF="17">tells a whim&s;ical Story of the <HI>Hyp|popotamus,</HI> or Sea-Hor&s;e; who, when he finds him&s;elf heavy or indi&s;pos'd, &s;eeks out the &s;harpe&s;t pointed Thorn, with which he pricks a certain Vein of the Leg; and after a Quantity of Blood is drawn, &s;tops the Wound with Mud: a very poor Precedent, that we are oblig'd to have recour&s;e to for this Operation.</P>
<P>But all the propo&s;ed Ends will be an&s;wer'd <HI>by opening an Artery.</HI> Tho I'm well a&s;&s;ur'd this Hypothe&s;is will be exploded by the greate&s;t part of the Faculty, it being not only what is uncommon, but al&s;o their being un|acquainted how the Operation is to be perform'd, and the hazard of at|tempting it, will occa&s;ion the fol|lowing Objections, to render this Method trifling and incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Some fancy with <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> that an Artery once cut, by rea&s;on of its Sy&s;tole and Dia&s;tole, from the Solu|tion of its Fibres, can't again con&s;oli|date and grow together, but forms a Thrombus.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="18">
<P>Others have had Stupidity enough to affirm, that tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t be pa&s;t through with a Needle and Thread, in order to re-unite them.</P>
<P>Again, there are tho&s;e who will allow of it in &s;ome Ca&s;es; yet own that they contract, retire within the Fle&s;h, are cicatrized there, and &s;o cea&s;e from their Office of conveying Blood to that Part.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;ome, that after they have been prevail'd upon to acknowledge the Po&s;&s;ibility of their Re-union; yet &s;till object again&s;t the Inconveniencies of Bandages, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be continued for &s;everal Days.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e Objections have been an&s;wer'd by ocular Demon&s;tra|tion, they'l undertake to prove, that the Blood in the Arteries, and that of the Veins, does not in the lea&s;t differ in their component Parts; and that both being continued Tubes, it matters not out of which the Eva|cuation is made. Whereas there is no greater difference between the Fluid contain'd in the Lympheducts and Nerves, than between that in
<PB N="12" REF="19">the Veins and Arteries: that of the Arteries being of a more lively, flo|rid, &s;carlet Colour, more &s;ubtil and &s;piritous, and the Vehicle that con|veys the Alimentary or Nutritious Particles, which in their progre&s;&s;ive Motion, pre&s;s upon tho&s;e Glands who&s;e Pores are adapted to admit of &s;uch Juices as &s;erve either for Ac|cretion, Nutrition, or Reparation: whereas the Venal being only the Refu&s;e of tho&s;e Secretions, returns to the Heart, that &s;o by filling its Coronary Ve&s;&s;els and Ventricles it may be enabled to perform its Mo|tion of Contraction and Dilatation, which, if its Reflux be intercepted by Bandages, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be depriv'd of, and con&s;equently &s;uch Effects are produc'd as before men|tion'd. So that this Objection is as trifling and frivolous as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e being &s;o ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd, a|nother unan&s;werable Objection is &s;tarted, <HI>viz.</HI> That that Branch, which we dur&s;t attempt to draw Blood from, is &s;o &s;mall, as not to admit of a plentiful Di&s;charge.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="20">
<P>But the mo&s;t powerful Argument to an&s;wer all the&s;e Objections, is De|mon&s;tration. I've us'd this Method in all Ca&s;es where dimini&s;hing the Quantity of Blood is requir'd, whe|ther in Apoplexies, Quinancies, In|flammations of the Lungs, Pleuri|&s;ies, A&s;thma's; in all &s;orts of Fe|vers, whether intermitting, continual, or malignant, without the lea&s;t mi&s;|chievous Accident attending it. But this Precaution mu&s;t be u&s;ed, that it be &s;uch an Artery as immediately pa&s;&s;es over a Bone, which are none but tho&s;e of the Head; and of the&s;e the <HI>Tem|poral Artery</HI> is the Principal, it being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Branch of the Carotid, which pa&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Os Temporale,</HI> admits of a double Com|pre&s;s. This may be open'd with le&s;s Danger, and with far greater Succe&s;s than any Vein; and I've frequently &s;een it run with as continu'd a Stream, as from the Arm.</P>
<P>By this time there's no room to doubt but the chief Difficulties are remov'd; and becau&s;e &s;o few are ac|cu&s;tom'd to this Operation, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention how 'tis perform'd;
<PB N="14" REF="21">which is thus. Pre&s;s your Finger on the Ve&s;&s;el, above the place where you de&s;ign your Aperture, and your Thumb on the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el beneath, to keep the Skin &s;mooth, and the Ve&s;&s;el from rolling; then introduce your Lancet, rai&s;ing up its Point to cut thro the Ve&s;&s;els and Teguments, but not by Punction, as too many do in opening the Veins; by which means you may make as plentiful a Di&s;charge as you plea&s;e, without be|ing liable to the afore-mention'd In|conveniencies that attend Phlebo|tomy.</P>
<P>After which, you have nothing el&s;e to do than to place your Thumb on the Orifice, and pre&s;s it again&s;t the <HI>Os Temporale;</HI> &s;o that if a Throm|bus &s;hould ari&s;e, 'tis &s;oon di&s;pers'd, and in a few Minutes the Lips of the Orifice will unite. This done, you may either u&s;e a Pledgit of Lint with a Plai&s;ter, or if you plea&s;e, the Com|pre&s;s with the circular Bandage, which is &s;ufficient without the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion of Styptics.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="22">
<P>This Aperture gives an immediate Check to the impetuous Velocity of the a&s;cending Blood; which by the Sy&s;tole or Contraction of the Heart is projected to the Head by the Ca|rotids and Vertebral Arteries, and by means of their Semilunary Valves prevent its Return to the Heart by the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that in an in|&s;tant it relieves the Patient, without preventing the Blood, Lymph, and Nervous Fluid, from performing their circular Tour, which by Ligatures mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be intercepted.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e &s;everal Springs &s;end out as many Rivulets, which after various Turnings and Windings unite and form a River, which is receiv'd in a Ba|&s;on; wherein an Engin is fix'd, which, with its repeated projectile Force, throws the Water into &s;everal Tubes, in order to be convey'd to and &s;up|ply all Parts of a City: now &s;hould there be an Ob&s;truction in the Pipes, the Engineer may as well expect to remove it by diverting and dimi|ni&s;hing the Water in the Rivulets, by a different Current, as a Phy&s;ician may expect to remove an Ob&s;truction
<PB N="16" REF="23">in the Arteries, by ordering bleeding out of the Veins.</P>
<P>But there is no occa&s;ion to intro|duce Similies to prove what is &s;o ve|ry obvious.</P>
<P>'Tis the part of a Phy&s;ician to a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature, by ob&s;erving nicely the various Steps &s;he takes to re|pul&s;e the Enemy. <HI>Natura curat Mor|bos,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Cel&s;us.</HI> The Dogmati&s;t, that can rea&s;on learnedly on a Di&s;ea&s;e, but has not throughly con&s;ider'd the Nature of it, and the Method of Cure, falls far &s;hort of a meer Em|pyric, who practi&s;es only by Ex|perience without any Foundation of Learning; &s;o that 'tis not the being a learned Philo&s;opher, an accurate A|natomi&s;t, that entitles a Man to be a great Phy&s;ician. That &s;ucce&s;sful Practitioner, Dr. <HI>Radcliff,</HI> never pre|tended to any of the&s;e Qualifica|tions, nay took a Plea&s;ure to di&s;own his Knowledg in them; but who in his time &s;o happy to &s;trike at the Root of a Di&s;temper!</P>
<P>The Father of Phy&s;ic, <HI>Hippocra|tes,</HI> when the Art was in its Infan|cy, e&s;pecially that part of it, Ana|tomy,
<PB N="17" REF="24">how ignorant was he of &s;ome Parts of Learning, that the Moderns glory in, and value them&s;elves upon? as appears from the confus'd Ac|count he gives, that the Veins take their Ri&s;e from the Liver: and &s;peak|ing of an Artery, he means the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria;</HI> and then calls the Ureters Veins, and makes a Jumble of Nerves, Veins, and Arteries. But then who &s;o great and &s;ucce&s;sful a Practitioner ever before or &s;ince?</P>
<P>Tho I'm not un&s;en&s;ible that &s;eve|ral Authors have touch'd on this Subject, yet what fir&s;t induc'd me to the Opinion of <HI>Arteriotomy,</HI> was, that I don't remember ever to have read or heard of Women liable to Apoplexies, unle&s;s from Poi&s;ons, O|piates, or Mi&s;management of &s;ome foregoing Di&s;temper.

'Tis well known that bleeding at the No&s;e re|moves Ob&s;tructions and Pains of the Head, whether proceeding from an Ebullition or Redundancy of Blood. And whence is this Di&s;charge but by an <HI>Ana&s;tomo&s;is,</HI> or Sponta|neous disjoining of the Capillary Arteries, occa&s;ion'd by a convul&s;ive Contraction of the Coats of a larger Artery? which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give an extraordinary Di&s;tention to the next, till the Blood can be no longer
<PB N="19" REF="26">contain'd, but bur&s;ts out with Im|petuo&s;ity, even to Pounds; whereas a few Ounces, di&s;charg'd by the Veins, has thrown the Patient into Faintings, Swoonings, and occa&s;ion'd even Death it &s;elf.</P>

<P><HI>Phlebotomy</HI> preceding, the next Intention is exhibiting <HI>Emetics;</HI> which from Ob&s;ervation I &s;hall prove to be &s;o far from relieving the Pa|tient, that it proves very pernicious.</P>
<P>For before the Vomit is admini&s;|tred, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e to what a de|gree the Glands of the Brain are fil|trated, and perhaps the Sanguiferous Ve&s;&s;els and Lymphatics bur&s;t. This
<PB N="20" REF="27">extrava&s;ated Blood and Lymph di&s;|charg'd into the <HI>Sinus's</HI> of the Brain, and there coagulated and lodg'd: what Relief can po&s;&s;ibly be expec|ted from an Emetick, which is dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to their former Intention of bleeding out of the Jugulars? For in this there is &s;ome colour of Rea&s;on to expect the Re|moval of the Ob&s;truction; from that there's no room to hope for any thing but a Confirmation of the Di&s;|temper; nor truly in any other Di&s;|ea&s;e, unle&s;s when the principal Seat is in the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, to di&s;charge the morbific Matter, col|lected in the <HI>Primae Viae.</HI> Then an Emetic is not altogether un&s;ea&s;on|able; tho even then other Mea&s;ures may be taken le&s;s hazardous, and e|qually advantageous. But in this Ca&s;e: Vomits are as contrary to true Practice, as this Operation to Na|ture; the Fibres of the Stomach being &s;o di&s;pos'd, as to di&s;charge its Contents through the Inte&s;tines: but by the&s;e irritating Vomits the Dia|phragm, Interco&s;tals, and Mu&s;cles of the lower Belly are &s;o &s;timulated,
<PB N="21" REF="28">that by means of their violent Con|traction, they force 'em thro the Oe|&s;ophagus: for what with the violent convul&s;ive Motion of the above&s;aid Mu&s;cles, together with the Quick|ne&s;s of the Organs of Re&s;piration, the Blood is precipitately hurried and projected to the Brain with that Force as to increa&s;e the Extrava&s;a|tion. How then it is po&s;&s;ible rea|&s;onably to expect Relief from it, I can't conjecture. An antient Phy|&s;ician, &s;peaking of an Apoplexy and its Cure, lays down this as a Rule: <HI>Vomitoria fugienda, ne &s;uffocationis pe|riculum augeatur, et caput repleatur.</HI> Nay, in his Purgatives he would not allow the lea&s;t Quantity of Antimo|ny, it being al&s;o endued with a vo|miting Faculty: <HI>Antimonium non convenit, cum vomitum &s;imul moveat;</HI> &s;uch &s;ort of irritating Medicines be|ing &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to pro|duce Apoplexies.</P>
<P>And I, for my part, verily believe, that were the Bills of Mortality nice|ly examin'd into, and the Cau&s;es of tho&s;e Ca&s;ualties &s;trictly enquir'd af|ter; they would be found more owing
<PB N="22" REF="29">to the irregular Admini&s;tration of improper Medicines, than to any peccant Matter in the Fluids, or any external Cau&s;e whatever.</P>

<P>A robu&s;t young Fellow, at the Siege of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els, Anno Dom.</HI> 1706. receiv|ing a Shot thro the <HI>Metatar&s;us;</HI> af|ter the Wound was well dige&s;ted, Suppuration promoted, and he in a fair way of Recovery, only com|plaining mightily for want of Sleep, the Phy&s;ician, in his Tour of Vi|&s;its, order'd him a gentle <HI>Hypnotic</HI> Draught: but the Apothecary's Man, in di&s;tributing the Medicines, gave him al&s;o to the Quantity of &s;e|ven Grains of <HI>Laudanum</HI> (Mi&s;takes of which kind in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ho&s;|pital are &s;eldom or ever known) the next Morning, to my Surprize, I found him dead. The Nur&s;e in|form'd me what Pills he had taken, how joco&s;e, plea&s;ant, and merrily di&s;pos'd he was, that he &s;ung very cheerfully, and a &s;hort while after dozed away.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="47">
<P>The next day, in opening his Head to &s;ee what Di&s;covery I could make, I no &s;ooner reach'd the <HI>Me|ninges,</HI> but I found &s;ome of the Ve&s;|&s;els di&s;tended to a prodigious degree, others bur&s;t, from whence i&s;&s;ued an incredible Quantity of Blood; and from the <HI>Sinus's</HI> came (as near as I could judg) to the Quantity of three Quarts that was extrava&s;ated.</P>
<P>Here's an In&s;tance of an <HI>Apoplexy</HI> from <HI>Laudanum,</HI> which convinces me that its <HI>Narcotic</HI> or <HI>Hypnotic</HI> Fa|culty proceeded neither from an occult Quality, or inten&s;e Coldne&s;s, either by coagulating or environing the Particles of Blood or Spirits, and &s;o preventing their Motion: for &s;ince by a Chymical <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> we find it gives a copious Quantity of fetid Oil and Volatile Spirit, it plain|ly con&s;utes that A&s;&s;ertion of its be|ing cold; but on the contrary, it di&s;|&s;olves the Texture of the Blood, ren|ders the Humours more fluid, hur|ries the Spirits into di&s;orderly Mo|tions, and the Heart, by its repeated Sy&s;tole, projects the Blood with too great a Velocity to the Brain.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="48">
<P>Indeed when the <HI>Opium</HI> begins fir&s;t of all to in&s;inuate it &s;elf, it rarifies the Arterial Blood: this be|ing rarified, the Spirits then, not &s;o much fetter'd with bloody Particles, are in a greater quantity, and with more ea&s;e, &s;ecern'd by the Glands of the Brain, and convey'd in a greater <HI>Copia</HI> by the Nerves thro all Parts of the Body; which produces that Pa&s;|&s;ion of the Mind, <HI>Joy:</HI> but when by this Rarefaction the Arteries are &s;o di&s;tended, as to compre&s;s the Nerves, and retard the Circulation of their Fluid, <HI>Comato&s;e</HI> Di&s;tempers mu&s;t there nece&s;&s;arily be produc'd.

<P>Mr. <HI>Kilbraith,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Bri&s;|tol,</HI> about Forty Five Years of Age, labouring for many Years under a <HI>Hypocondriac Melancholy,</HI> continu'd under the Phy&s;icians hands for a long time; but was &s;o far from reap|ing the lea&s;t Benefit from their Pre|&s;criptions, that he daily declin'd, and lo&s;t his Appetite; nay, the very Sight and Smell of Meats were &s;o offen&s;ive as to create a <HI>Nau&s;ea,</HI> till at length he had contracted a Complication of Di&s;ea&s;es: then he committed him&s;elf to my Care, who in a &s;hort time had the good Fortune to be the In&s;tru|ment of his Recovery.</P>
<P>Some time after having an Affair at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and there meeting with a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, he was prevail'd upon to bathe him|&s;elf; but what with &s;weating, the Vitriolic, Sulphureous, or Bitumi|nous <HI>Effluvia</HI> of the Waters, he be|came faint, heavy, and render'd al|mo&s;t Lethargic: however relying too much on the Strength of Nature, he neglected the U&s;e of Means, till one
<PB N="43" REF="50">Night being taken with a Contraction of the Nerves, and &s;oon after &s;eiz'd with a few Convul&s;ive Paroxy&s;ms; I was &s;ent for the Morning follow|ing, and advis'd him to air and ex|erci&s;e him&s;elf with gentle Riding: he no &s;ooner attempted to ri&s;e, and plac'd his Feet on the cold Floor, but was immediately &s;eiz'd with a violent Fit of an Apoplexy, and in a moment became cold, &s;tiff, and to all Appearance lifele&s;s. At this &s;ur|prizing Accident, the whole Family ran out to rally &s;ome of the Neigh|bourhood to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, left me alone, where I accidentally found a &s;mall Bottle of Spirits of Harts-horn, which I pour'd down his Throat; and at their Return I de&s;ir'd he might have a Friction all over his Body: which prov'd &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that I &s;oon per|ceiv'd a Pul&s;ation and Re&s;piration. I then took Sixteen Ounces of Blood from the Temporal Artery, and in le&s;s time than ever I ob&s;erv'd from the Arm; after which, I pre&s;crib'd what I thought proper for his Ca&s;e. Other Phy&s;icians who were al&s;o &s;ent
<PB N="44" REF="51">for, came, and to my Face approv'd of my Method of treating him, but after my Departure they ridicul'd it as mi&s;chievous and hurtful, &s;aying 'twas the only way to draw the Di&s;|temper to, and confirm it in the Head. Whether <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Malice</HI> had the A&s;cendant, or whether equal Parts of both contributed to furni&s;h their <HI>&V;pper Rooms,</HI> it matters not: but my Affairs obliging me to go a few Miles from thence, I de&s;ir'd the Sur|geon, if he was threatned with a re|turning Fit, to introduce his Lancet into the &s;ame Orifice, and take &s;uch a Quantity as might be requi&s;ite; but at the Attack of the next Fit, the&s;e judicious Gentlemen preven|ted the Surgeon, and di&s;&s;uaded the Friends, by amu&s;ing them with the dangerous Con&s;equence that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily accrue, till the Blood flew impetuou&s;ly out of the Mouth and No&s;e; and then, when 'twas too late, they con&s;ented. Howe|ver, after this &s;econd Di&s;charge he immediately recover'd his Sen&s;e and Speech. At my Return, his Friends inform'd me what had happen'd, and
<PB N="45" REF="52">that 'twas owing to tho&s;e Phy&s;icians, that they had not &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd my Method; at which being about to leave him, I was prevail'd upon, by his importuning me &s;o earne&s;tly, to tarry. I was entirely of the Opi|nion, that the Ve&s;&s;els of the Brain were bur&s;t; but however I de&s;ir'd a Con&s;ultation with Dr. <HI>Bave</HI> of <HI>Bath,</HI> and acquainted him with my Pro|ceedings, which he approv'd of, and gave him my Opinion of the De&s;|peratene&s;s of his Ca&s;e, which he al&s;o fear'd. But the other Phy&s;icians, tho their Companies and Opinions were de&s;ir'd, yet thought fit, as they had &s;neak'd off, to ab&s;cond, who be|ing too con&s;cious to them&s;elves of the irreparable Prejudice they had al|ready done; giving only this &s;huffling, trifling Excu&s;e, That truly Dr. <HI>Bave</HI> was &s;o &s;ingular as to con&s;ult with none but &s;uch as had been educated at <HI>Oxford;</HI> whereas that <HI>ingenious,</HI> as well as <HI>ingenuous</HI> Gentleman, who is a Credit to the Univer&s;ity where educated, an Advantage to the Town where he re&s;ides, and to &s;uch that have Recour&s;e there for
<PB N="46" REF="53">the Benefit of the Waters, regards the Qualifications of a Phy&s;ician more than the Place where quali|fy'd. After &s;ome Medicines pre|&s;crib'd, the Doctor returns without entertaining the lea&s;t Hopes of his Recovery; but the Patient re&s;ting well that Night, his former Phy&s;i|cians concluded then he was in a fair way of doing well. I took li|berty to inform 'em how great Stran|gers they were to his pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; and that when they were in the greate&s;t Expectations of his being out of danger, that then they would have mo&s;t rea&s;on to fear his being &s;natch'd away: which happen'd ac|cordingly; for the very en&s;uing Night, whil&s;t joco&s;e and merry with his Friends, he was &s;eiz'd of a &s;udden, and had ju&s;t time allow'd him to be|queath his Soul to God that gave it, and &s;o expir'd, &s;norting and di&s;charg|ing a va&s;t Quantity of Livid Blood from his No&s;trils.</P>
<P>This to me is an evident Proof that this Gentleman was entirely lo&s;t by this Neglect, the Di&s;ea&s;e be|ing too violent, and too &s;udden to

<PB N="55" REF="62">barbarous Treatment caus'd di&s;mal Stranguries; and the little Urine he made was with great Pain and much Difficulty, and of a bloody Tinc|ture, intermix'd with coagulated Matter, re&s;embling Lumps of Fat, &s;o large, that 'twould be thought incredible to pa&s;s the <HI>&V;rethra.</HI> By this Severity (tho entirely owing to a good Con&s;titution) he was not kill'd, yet it confirm'd a <HI>Hydrocepha|lus</HI> or Drop&s;y in his Head, which caus'd a &s;en&s;ible Decay thro all Parts of his Body, depriv'd him of his Speech, and the u&s;e of his Sen&s;es: and in this de&s;ponding State the Doctor left him.</P>
<P>All which Misfortunes might have been prevented by bleeding in the <HI>Artery,</HI> at the fir&s;t Appearance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and falling in with my Mea|&s;ures before mention'd.</P>

<P>This Operation of <HI>Arteriotomy,</HI> that the Generality are &s;o timerous and cautious of attempting, I've not only perform'd and order'd for A|dults, but even on Infants them|&s;elves.

<PB N="58" REF="65">he had refus'd, and &s;o with the U&s;e of proper Medicines perfectly reco|verd.</P>
<P>This Treati&s;e I don't doubt but will meet with &s;ome who will ap|prove of it, as well as other preju|dic'd Per&s;ons that will be as ready to contemn and condemn it. But what I've writ was entirely owing to a Sen&s;e of my Duty to my Fel|low-Creatures, without either con|&s;ulting the Applau&s;e of the former, or valuing in the lea&s;t the malicious Cen&s;ures of the latter.</P>

<PB N="60" REF="67">&s;uch Applications generate the Stone, but never di&s;&s;olve or carry it off; and in&s;tead of Syrups, Oleaginous and Tartarous Liquids, to recom|mend the U&s;e of Malt Liquors: and at the &s;ame time to &s;hew that Gravel is not producd from any De|ficiency in the Kidneys, but a Di&s;|order in the Bowels ari&s;ing from Indige&s;tion. At another time, I thought it would be no unu&s;eful thing to the Town, to demon&s;trate that the Con&s;umptions, which we frequently meet with, ari&s;e not from any Tendency in Nature, but from the mi&s;chievous Effects of improper and ill-apply'd Medicines in venereal Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>While I was thus in &s;u&s;pence, a Book ca&s;ually fell into my hands, of <HI>Ob&s;ervations on Bezoar-Stones, with a Vindication of Sugars,</HI> &amp;c. in which I &s;aw there was copious Mat|ter to remark upon: but finding in it a Letter from Dr. <HI>Cooke</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which extols this new Chalk Medicine above all others, I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to that part of the Book, and &s;how the World, by a few Ob&s;er|vations,

<P>Mrs. <HI>Paget,</HI> the Wife of a noted Man in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> had for many Years been afflicted with the Cholick and Stone, but &s;mall ones, and at &s;ome Sea&s;ons of the Year more violent than others.

I being &s;ent for (and being appriz'd how &s;he had been us'd) gave her &s;ome things of a warm attenuating Nature, by the Help of which &s;he di&s;charg'd va&s;t Quantities of a hard compact Sub|&s;tance, that was generated in her Stomach, with much Choler and Bile. Afterwards &s;he had an Evacua|tion downwards of great Numbers of Stones that were hardned in the Bowels, occa&s;ion'd by this Chalk mixing it &s;elf with the Flame in the Stomach; by which means they
<PB N="62" REF="69">were lapify'd by the Heat of the Liver, as Chalk will be before the Fire when mix'd with Water. Up|on the &s;econd Application, many more came away, &s;ome &s;maller, and &s;ome greater. The third time &s;he di&s;charg'd one as large as a big Walnut, which I have now by me, and which &s;hows where it was fa&s;tned to the <HI>Ductus Bilearius,</HI> and the Fur|rows made by the Peri&s;taltic Mo|tion of the Guts; and by pricking of it you bring out the very Chalk, as appears from mixing it with Wa|ter, that gives a Colour like other Chalk. From that moment &s;he was reliev'd from all Complaints; and falling a&s;leep for &s;ome hours, &s;he wak'd perfectly refre&s;h'd.

<PB N="65" REF="72">the <HI>Pyloris,</HI> by the Weight of the Waters, which relax'd that Orifice of the Stomach to &s;uch a degree, that it could no more contract it &s;elf: add to this, that the continual Defluxion of that &s;harp corro&s;ive Matter that had &s;o long been pent in among the Folds of the Stomach, inflam'd both it and the Guts &s;o greatly, that &s;he fell into continual Purgings till &s;he expir'd.

<P>THE Con&s;ideration of Gra&s;s for Bea&s;ts, leads me to Corn; name|ly, the Staff of Life for human Kind; of the four Grains, Wheat, Rye, Barly, Oats; of each of the&s;e Bread may be made very whole&s;om and good. It is true, if you chew and eat any of the&s;e, they do not give &s;o &s;ignal a Sweet to our Ta&s;te, as what is really contain'd in them, and will &s;oon be made to exert that Sweetne&s;s. For Example, if you do but wet any of the&s;e Corns in com|mon Water, you will &s;tir up &s;ome active inherent Principles, which will ferment and &s;well the Grain, and make it to grow (as the Mal|&s;ters call it.) This gives them no|tice of &s;preading it abroad to dry, which may be done in the Sun; but for Conveniency is perform'd on a Kiln, by the Admi&s;&s;ion of Heat from the Fire made beneath it. This is now call'd Malt; if you eat a Grain or two, you will di&s;cern it to be &s;weet; if you boil it in Water (af|ter it has been powder'd or ground)
<PB N="73" REF="80">it will give a &s;weet Tincture, com|monly call'd Wort; you may boil it to the Con&s;i&s;tence of a Syrup: And this Product of Corn &s;omewhat a|grees with Mello&s;&s;us, which if it be &s;pread upon Bread, it adds con&s;i|derable Nouri&s;hment to your Bread, and would be e&s;teem'd a good Ban|quet, and plea&s;ant Entertainment, did we not abound with &s;o many other more refin'd and dainty Sweets, and ea&s;ier to come at. Thus Mel|lo&s;&s;us is commonly given to School-Boys with their Bread; nor can I think it bad Food for Children, be|cau&s;e more mi&s;chief may be due to|their new &s;pungy or dowy, and not well baked Bread, than to the <HI>Indian</HI> Sweet. It is this &s;weet Decoction of Malt that makes your great Va|riety of fine Ales and Beer, much more whole&s;om, more plea&s;ant and fit for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bodies, than your ad|mir'd Wines, whether <HI>Rheni&s;h, French,</HI> or <HI>Florence;</HI> for the&s;e do abound with gritty, tartarous Matter, very apt to lodg in the Kidneys, and lay the Foundation of the mo&s;t intolerable Di&s;temper in the World, the Stone;
<PB N="74" REF="81">or if they be &s;o happy to e&s;cape that, the Gout will make an Attack on the Joints of the Toes or Fingers of a potent Drinker, and tear and &s;well the tender Parts, and &s;ometimes mercifully thru&s;t out tho&s;e <HI>Tophi</HI> or Stones into the extream Parts, which otherwi&s;e would probably have been ca&s;t upon the too &s;en&s;ible and pa&s;|&s;ive Kidneys: but none could ever charge our &s;oft and bal&s;amick Ale with breeding any &s;ort of &s;andy or tartarous Matter in the Barrel, and I think not in the Body. I cannot forbear mentioning an Ob&s;ervation of my good Friend Dr. <HI>Cyprianus,</HI> who told me long &s;ince, he had cut above fourteen Hundred Per&s;ons for the Stone, but never ob&s;erv'd that he cut any Ale-hou&s;e Keepers, but many Vintners. He always advis'd his Patients that fear'd the Stone, or were concern'd with that excrucia|ting Di&s;ea&s;e, to drink &s;oft Ale, the newer the better: for he condemns mo&s;t or all four Juices, as apt to breed the Stone, or increa&s;e it.</P>
