<P>AS there is no medical theory, formed from in|duction, to enable us to detect what is erroneous or fal&s;e in the accounts of facts, or to direct us in the treatment of new ca&s;es; the following attempt to connect with an important organ many otherwi&s;e loo&s;e facts, may tend to facilitate the recollection and application of them, and thus abridge the range of inquiry. The number &s;ugge&s;ted by this view is &s;o great, that there is le&s;s difficulty in the collection than in the choice; their relation and order, familiar only to one's own habit of a&s;&s;ociation, may to others at fir&s;t be ob&s;cure; and &s;ome of them may be di&s;puted; but the leading ones &s;eem to &s;how that the &s;tomach is the &s;eat of life, di&s;ea&s;e, and recovery, and the main organ of a complicated &s;y&s;tem. Many authors, as Vanhelmont, Rega, Bordeu, Lacaze, Barthez, Fouquet, and particularly Mr. Hunter, lean, in their u&s;eful writings, to the opinion held in this &s;ummary, which was meant as part of heads of lectures on Materia Medica, read in Edinburgh &s;everal years ago. The farther application of the doctrine to prac|tice, will probably appear &s;oon.</P>

<HEAD>Facts tending to &s;how the Connexion of the Sto|mach with Life, Di&s;ea&s;e, and Remedy.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH &s;imply organized animals as have no vi&s;ible brain, nerves, lungs, heart, or blood-ve&s;&s;els, and even vegetables, con|tract and re-act on impre&s;&s;ions being made on any part of them; and being cut in pieces, each becomes a living individual. They &s;eparate the elements of dead matter which re-unite within them in various and &s;pecific proportions, and extend their fibres; they propagate their kinds who&s;e particles and fibres are arranged into &s;pecific forms, as all con&s;olidated fluids are; they have a pre&s;erving and re&s;i&s;ting power called vis con|&s;ervatrix and medicatrix naturae; become de|ranged in their functions and &s;tructure by
<PB N="2" REF="5">exce&s;s, defect, or peculiarity of impre&s;&s;ion; recover from various morbid &s;tates; rege|nerate lo&s;t &s;ub&s;tance; cea&s;e at length to an|&s;wer impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;epa|rate into their elements, which form new combinations in nature.</P>
<P>In an animal, which, be&s;ides a &s;to|mach, the &s;eat of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;imilation and &s;imple life, has nerves and brain, the me|dium of &s;en&s;ation and thought, the energy of which is encrea&s;ed by a heart and lungs; the a&s;&s;imilating, moving, &s;entient, and thinking powers become parts of one whole, nece&s;&s;ary to the action and effect of one ano|ther, acting as it were in a circle, modify|ing and improving the &s;y&s;tem, in which the &s;malle&s;t puncture producing contractility, pain, and haemorrage, &s;eems to &s;hew that life, mind, and heart exi&s;t in every point.</P>
<P>Cold-blooded animals, who&s;e circulation is languid, and re&s;piration occa&s;ional, live and move for &s;everal hours without brain,
<PB N="3" REF="6">heart, or lungs: the heart of a young hot|blooded animal continues its motions for &s;ome time after its connexion with the brain is cut off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whytt.</NOTE>; in phthi&s;is pulmonalis there is &s;ometimes &s;carcely a ve&s;tige of lungs left; &s;ome per&s;ons have the power of &s;u&s;pending the action of the heart<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gregory.</NOTE>, and it is &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pended without the will, while the other functions continue entire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hunter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After decollation, it is &s;aid, a viper tra|ver&s;ed &s;everal walks in a garden; an o&s;trich continued running in a circular cour&s;e leading to an accu&s;tomed place of refuge; and a cock impul&s;ively continued its motion towards &s;ome grain that had been ju&s;t pre|&s;ented to it; a turtle, who&s;e &s;trength, con|&s;idering its ma&s;&s;y &s;hell, mu&s;t be very great, lives for months without the head<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Redi.</NOTE>: foetu&s;es have been born alive without brain, cere|bellum, or &s;pinal marrow. In drop&s;y of the
<PB N="4" REF="7">head, nothing has been found but the membranes; &s;ome have lo&s;t a con&s;iderable part of the brain and recovered; all the in|voluntary motions, and even the u&s;e of the limbs, have continued a day or two after the &s;pinal marrow has been divided<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;&s;ault.</NOTE>; the involuntary ones continue when the &s;en&s;es and brain are locked up in &s;leep, lethargy, and apoplexy, and in the &s;u&s;pended action of the heart and lungs in &s;yncope. In mania the vigour is often increa&s;ed and the &s;en&s;ibility dimini&s;hed, while the contrary is generally ob&s;erved in indige&s;tion, gout, and nervous di&s;ea&s;es, in which the intellect is often unimpaired. The contractility la&s;ts much longer if an animal be killed by de|&s;troying its brain than otherwi&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Blane.</NOTE>; death, occa&s;ioned by over-exertion of the mu&s;cles, by the electric, carbonic, or azotic fluids, or by the poi&s;on of a viper, prevents the mu&s;cles
<PB N="5" REF="8">from becoming rigid, and di&s;po&s;es to a much quicker putrefaction; and the life in vege|tables, particularly in their &s;eeds, in a chick before incubation, and in the hibernating animals, as in the &s;wallow, mountain-rat, and dormou&s;e, re&s;i&s;ts the tendency to putre|faction, and freezing. The brain of a man, in proportion to the weight of his body, is above thirty times heavier than that of a large quadruped, and &s;till more &s;o than that of an amphibious one, as the crocodile, with proportionably le&s;s &s;trength. The brain has a &s;mall proportion likewi&s;e, in long|necked birds, fi&s;hes, and in&s;ects; and is &s;in|gularly large in &s;ome &s;mall animals, as &s;mall birds and rats. In the lower animals it is in general &s;pent in nerves on the &s;en&s;es, face, and jaws, as the &s;pinal marrow is in tho&s;e on the trunk which are large in pro|portion; and in all animals the axillary and &s;ciatic nerves and blood-ve&s;&s;els, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trong voluntary motion, are the large&s;t.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<P>The pulp of the brain and nerves has very little contractility. Parts of animals live and grow without nerves; a limb, after its nerve is cut, though it lo&s;es its power of voluntary motion and &s;en&s;a|tion, and, after &s;ome time, begins to wa&s;te, yet does not putrefy, but retains its con|tractility, temperature, and circulation; and a wound or fracture in this ca&s;e heals, though the nerve be not regenerated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monro.</NOTE>. A mu&s;cle, as the heart, who&s;e nerves bear no proportion to its bulk and action, cut off, retains its contractility. Pal&s;ied limbs void of &s;en&s;e or motion, or of both, are &s;ometimes ex|tremely contractile, inflame, &s;uppurate, and heal, as in the ca&s;e of a bli&s;ter, which does not &s;o readily happen in a moribund patient; and an ob&s;tinate ulcer in the affected &s;ide has been known to heal quickly on the attack of hemiplegia.</P>
<P>No animal can exi&s;t without a &s;tomach; life has remained even in the perfect ani|mals
<PB N="7" REF="10">independently of almo&s;t every other organ; the &s;tomach is the only organ which, as in the zoophytes, the hydatid, the oy&s;ter, the polypus, and &s;ome other vermes, can be &s;aid to exi&s;t as an animal by it&s;elf; the&s;e animals are capable of every mu&s;cular motion, and of every living power &s;uited to their mode of exi&s;tence and the conti|nuance of their kind. Placed in the mid|dle, the &s;tomach is felt to be the centre of every impre&s;&s;ion on any part of the body or the mind, and the &s;eat of mu&s;cular exertion and fatigue. A blow, or the wind of a cannon-ball over the &s;tomach, kills with|out leaving any mark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blane.</NOTE>; if any of its nerves be cut or it&s;elf wounded, the aliment re|mains unchanged; when healthy it re&s;i&s;ts, arre&s;ts, and rever&s;es the &s;tages of fermen|tation, &s;weetens putrid meat, does not &s;uffer from the &s;yphilitic, variolous, viperine or
<PB N="8" REF="11">carbonic poi&s;ons, which injure only the bare &s;urface or pa&s;&s;ages to the no&s;e and lungs. It is the receptacle of food, poi&s;on, and medi|cine, the effects of which on it&s;elf are pro|pagated to every other part; it is mo&s;t &s;ub|ject to di&s;order, mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible to remedy, regulating, and regulated by, the motions and &s;en&s;ations of the whole &s;y&s;tem, and &s;o accommodating it&s;elf as to keep all the parts in balance. Languido ventriculo omnia lan|guent, vegeto vigent. In mo&s;t ca&s;es it is the fir&s;t organ that feels, and the la&s;t that fails<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is generally a di&s;charge of faeces after death.</NOTE> Even the &s;tate of the mind or character &s;eems connected with it, vigorous and ferocious animals being generally carnivorous, with mu&s;cular vigour in proportion to their voracity. It &s;eems to be the centre of power and motion from which the vital principle, whatever it be, is determined into the different parts, &s;upporting the in|herent
<PB N="9" REF="12">power in the moving fibres, the thinking power in the brain, &s;en&s;ation in the &s;entient extremities, a&s;&s;imilation in the lymphatic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From fi&s;hes living and growing in di&s;tilled water and air<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>, from the in&s;tances of people living &s;o long in di&s;ea&s;e and in health, without nouri&s;hment by the mouth, and from the relief of thir&s;t and even hunger, by the application of water to the &s;kin, water and air &s;eem to be not only ab&s;orbed and carried, but a&s;&s;imi|lated by the lymphatics.</NOTE>, &s;anguiferous, and glandular ve&s;&s;els, and the fulne&s;s in every part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>When the ga&s;tric energy is dimini&s;hed, parts &s;eem to lo&s;e their motion and &s;en&s;e as they are di&s;tant from the &s;tomach; as the tips of the no&s;e and ears, the fingers and toes, and the va&s;cular extremities. Like the &s;en&s;es, it has &s;pecific &s;en&s;ations, as of hunger, thir&s;t, &s;atiety, longing, loathing,
<PB N="10" REF="13">&s;ickne&s;s, peculiar pain, with a great variety of namele&s;s &s;tates without &s;en&s;ation, ac|companied with corre&s;ponding changes, ac|cording to predi&s;po&s;ition in different parts of the &s;y&s;tem. A grain of a ta&s;tele&s;s &s;ub|&s;tance will affect the &s;tomach, and, through it, the other parts, or the&s;e only, while various acrids, pungent aromatics, and &s;pi|rits, can often be taken in large quantity, without producing any remarkable effect whatever. Stones of con&s;iderable &s;ize have been &s;wallowed, and the &s;tomach it&s;elf, though, from its organic contractility, it is always full, can be in very different &s;tates of di&s;ten&s;ion and contraction, with even morbid tumor, without much inconveni|ence. Leidenfro&s;t mentions a ca&s;e, in which the application of warm wine to the villous coat of a wounded inte&s;tine excited great motion without any pain, even on rubbing off the mucus &s;o as to bring blood. There is often little or no pain felt in the action of
<PB N="11" REF="14">violent vomiting or purging, &s;o that living motion does not, even in the perfect ani|mals, imply &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The alimentary canal, which, on open|ing a living animal, hardly &s;eems to move, &s;hows, as &s;oon as the other parts die, &s;trongly increa&s;ed motions, which, like the contractility mentioned above, continue for hours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caldani and Fontana.</NOTE>. In the ca&s;e of violent death, as that of beheading, the &s;ame increa&s;ed motions, after &s;ome &s;hort &s;pace, with an impetuous &s;pring of blood from the ve&s;&s;els, are remarkable; which motions may, per|haps, independently of the ga&s;tric liquor, &s;ometimes occa&s;ion tho&s;e perforations in the &s;tomach ob&s;erved in &s;uch ca&s;es, particularly in infants even after natural death; and to &s;ome &s;imilar &s;tate of bowel may be referred the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Scotland this is called earth or yerd-hunger.</NOTE> e&s;uries and priapi&s;mus moribundorum. This re&s;i&s;ting or reacting power or vis con|&s;ervatrix and medicatrix, in which the
<PB N="12" REF="15">power of recovery &s;eems to re&s;ide, is evident in the ca&s;e of other impre&s;&s;ions on the &s;tomach, the &s;urface, and the mind, as in the action of an emetic, the glow from the cold bath, and the red &s;uffu&s;ion produced by pa&s;&s;ion; and it is this which &s;eems chiefly to enable a healthy animal to bear changes and extremes of the ordinary ones, as tho&s;e of temperature, air, food and drink, motion, &s;en&s;ation, and thought, in a remarkable de|gree. The powers acting on the &s;y&s;tem, as heat, air, exerci&s;e of body and mind, diet, poi&s;on, medicine, and the fluids, tend to in|crea&s;e the power of the &s;tomach, but ulti|mately, or in exce&s;s, to de&s;troy it; and are called &s;timulants. When defective they tend to dimini&s;h it, and are called &s;edative, which effect, if of a certain degree, is fol|lowed by the reaction or re&s;i&s;tance; and they are then called indirect &s;timulants. Hence the &s;ame natural morbid and &s;alutary im|pre&s;&s;ions may, according to their degree, be
<PB N="13" REF="16">&s;edative or &s;timulant. Some impre&s;&s;ions, both internal and external, affect it pecu|liarly, and, through it, different parts of the &s;y&s;tem. In general, &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions excite the re&s;i&s;ting power, weak ones &s;eem occa&s;ionally to &s;ooth, dimini&s;h, or tea&s;e it, &s;pecific ones produce &s;pecific &s;tates in it and in different parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and on the&s;e fits of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;eem to depend the &s;tates of periodical di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach is the &s;eat of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;i|milating power, in which the elements of food and drink, of whatever kind and va|riety, &s;eparate, and then unite into the only one combination fit for undergoing the other &s;pecific changes, for making the &s;pe|cific impre&s;&s;ions, for giving the due di&s;ten|&s;ion, and repairing the continual wa&s;te; and its &s;pontaneous effort or &s;truggle with local injury, &s;eems to excite that &s;ymptomatic fever, or &s;tate of ve&s;&s;el which renders the parts of the blood more &s;eparable, forming
<PB N="14" REF="17">the buffy-coat, the inflammatory exudation, the &s;uppuration, and the callus or o&s;&s;ifying arteries, &s;o as to regenerate de&s;troyed parts, fill cavities, and form &s;kin. On its &s;tate &s;eems to depend that of the chyle, blood, &s;ecretions, every &s;oft and hard fibre, every organ and function of the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;uch is its importance, that it has been emphati|cally called the animal, the con&s;cience of the body, and even &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;eat of the &s;oul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, Vanhelmont, Mandevelle, Hunter.</NOTE></P>
<P>During ordinary hunger, its power over the mu&s;cles is dimini&s;hed, which &s;tate is called weakne&s;s; there is a dimini&s;hed action of the heart and arteries, particularly at their extremities, as appears from the weak and frequent pul&s;e, dryne&s;s, palene&s;s, &s;hrinking, and lankne&s;s of the &s;urface and features; dimini&s;hed &s;ecretion, as appears from the dry mouth and from the flaccid
<PB N="15" REF="18">brea&s;ts of nur&s;es, a le&s;s free re&s;piration, yawn|ing, hiccup, weak voice, &s;en&s;ibility to cold, feeblene&s;s of mind and peevi&s;hne&s;s, with various other &s;ymptoms in different indi|viduals. This e&s;urient &s;tate, like that of other appetites and temporary &s;tates of di|&s;ea&s;e, goes off, is apt to change into the loathing or &s;ick &s;tate, then returns, becom|ing irre&s;i&s;tible, enabling the &s;tomach to di&s;|&s;olve leather and other indige&s;tible matters; and producing exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t, delirium, and other &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>On the &s;ight of food, the mouth fills with water; and on taking &s;ome, the e&s;urient &s;tate with its &s;ymptoms is removed, the &s;tomach feels comfortable, the mu&s;cles and organs, particularly tho&s;e mo&s;t fatigued, re|cover their &s;trength, the circulation is pro|moted, the &s;ecretions flow, the re&s;piration becomes free, the countenance brightens up, &s;erenity and vigour are imparted to body and mind, and the heart opens in benevolence.
<PB N="16" REF="19">During this &s;ated &s;tate the new impre&s;&s;ion, as if engro&s;&s;ing the power of the &s;tomach, is apt to induce a chilline&s;s, drow&s;ine&s;s, heat, full pul&s;e and per&s;piration, the phoenomena of &s;light fever, and in &s;ome, formidable &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The effects of food, as of every thing el&s;e, being relative to the &s;tate of the &s;tomach, what is light to one is heavy to another; and a cordial in &s;ome &s;tates occa|&s;ions vomiting. A heavy meal oppre&s;&s;es the &s;tomach, and depre&s;&s;es its power over the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, often induc|ing alarming &s;ymptoms, which are fre|quently relieved by a puke, or by &s;pirits or aromatics, increa&s;ing the power of the &s;tomach. Alcohol, opium, or carbonic acid tends like a meal, to induce &s;erenity and vigour of body and mind, but if in exce&s;s, brings on the ebrious &s;tate of &s;tomach, which deranges the functions of both. A tre&s;pa&s;s in eating or drinking, or any thing
<PB N="17" REF="20">which from temperament, ta&s;te, or a&s;&s;ocia|tion of ideas, happens to di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, is apt in&s;tantly to occa&s;ion various &s;ymptoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus a raw cucumber, turnip, or raddi&s;h, ker|nels of fruits, mu&s;hrooms, bitters, honey, &s;pirits, acids, eggs, &s;hell-fi&s;h, ab&s;orbent-earth, nitre, any thing cold when the body is warm, are apt to occa|&s;ion indige&s;tion, colic, diarrhoea, cholera, hypochon|dria&s;is, hy&s;teria, gout, palpitation, a&s;thma, aphonia, &s;yncope, apoplexy, pal&s;y, epilep&s;y, tetanus, haemor|rhage, &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of natural di&s;charges, drop&s;y, eruption with fever, to renew and exa&s;perate a gleet, a &s;ore, or the pain of a gouty or rheumatic limb.</NOTE></P>
<P>What weakne&s;s, &s;pa&s;ms, pains and aches, &s;titches, depravations and depriva|tions of &s;en&s;e and motion, and unea&s;y feelings of body and mind, does not a little air pent up occa&s;ion, and its expul|&s;ion in&s;tantly relieve? What &s;ymptom has not been occa&s;ionally referred to indige&s;tion, and what remedy does not fall under the
<PB N="18" REF="21">treatment of it and its effects? What di&s;ea&s;e is free from &s;ome affection of the &s;tomach or canal, and what fever does it not mark in its beginning, its progre&s;s, re|mi&s;&s;ion, cri&s;is, and cure? The di&s;ea&s;es of children are acknowledged to be mo&s;tly from the &s;tomach and bowels, and they are known to be cured of alarming &s;ymptoms by a puke, a gly&s;ter, or a purge. A per&s;on feels weak, lo&s;es colour and &s;pirits, has head|ach, giddine&s;s, and &s;hivering, and the pre|di&s;po&s;ed &s;uffer fits of their di&s;ea&s;es, without &s;u&s;pecting, as there is no &s;ickne&s;s, want of appetite, co&s;tivene&s;s, or affection of the &s;tomach, that they proceed from it, till a natural vomiting or loo&s;ene&s;s, an emetic or cathartic relieve the complaints. Fits, as of a&s;thma, chin-cough, hy&s;teria, and gout, are generally preceded by &s;ome affection of the canal, and dimini&s;h or go off by the ex|pul&s;ion of air or other matter.</P>
<P>There does not &s;eem to be one &s;ymptom or combination of &s;ymptoms, but may be
<PB N="19" REF="22">produced by &s;omething taken into the &s;to|mach, and, in the ca&s;e of poi&s;ons, its orifices have been found, on di&s;&s;ection, &s;o con&s;tricted as to have prevented the e&s;cape of any of the matter.</P>
<P>The effect of poi&s;on, like that of food and medicine, is relative to the kind and &s;tate of &s;tomach. Cows and hares eat hemlock, hares eat milk-thi&s;tle, hogs fatten on hen|bane, quails on hellebore, and goats on eu|phorbium: a hor&s;e can take more gla&s;s of antimony than would kill an hundred men, a dog more opium than would kill an un|accu&s;tomed man, while an ordinary do&s;e of jalap, of nux-vomica, or a few bitter almonds, would convul&s;e and kill him. Bitter al|monds kill different kinds of birds likewi&s;e, and par&s;ley is poi&s;on to parrots. Indeed every animal and vegetable poi&s;on is the food of &s;ome animal, and notwith&s;tanding this difference of effect, little or no difference of &s;tructure in brain, mu&s;cle, membrane, and
<PB N="20" REF="23">bone, which form the animal &s;olids, can be perceived.</P>
<P>That the &s;tomach may be in a great va|riety of &s;tates, appears from the organs of &s;en&s;e being capable of &s;uch variety in re|gard to &s;en&s;ation, from cau&s;es external or internal.

A &s;tate of ve&s;&s;el that tea&s;es the &s;tomach and &s;y&s;tem, is often taken off by a &s;pontaneous haemorrhage or inflammation effected by an

<P>The elements of food and drink in form|ing chyle, blood, &s;ecretions, and &s;olid parts; and the ba&s;e of vital air uniting with the&s;e by the lungs, and perhaps by the &s;urface, may give the blood its colour, its temperature, its mobility, its coagulability, its power of acting on the left ventricle with tho&s;e appearances of vitality a&s;cribed to it by Mr. Hunter; and the&s;e conden&s;ations going on le&s;s in a warm temperature, and more in a cold one, may by the ac|commodating nature of the &s;tomach with the other parts, pre&s;erve the equilibrium of heat in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>That temperature on the &s;urface affects the &s;tomach, is evident from certain appli|cations of cold exciting vomiting and purg|ing; from hot applications, or a hot fit re|lieving tho&s;e vomitings which occur in fever and the plague; and from changes of
<PB N="46" REF="49">temperature inducing or relieving various di&s;ea&s;es, and fits of di&s;ea&s;e of which the &s;tomach is the feat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Farquhar mentions a patient, who, &s;ince the u&s;e of ice for burns, has continued free for a con&s;iderable time from hy&s;terical complaints of long &s;tanding.</NOTE>. A warm fomenta|tion relieves the &s;en&s;e of heat, handling &s;now occa&s;ions it, an irritation as from a thorn produces it, and an irritation in the &s;tomach occa&s;ions alternations of heat and cold. Human heat is between 32&deg; and 156&deg;, the two coagulating points; and the agreeable is, exclu&s;ively of habit, between 32&deg; and the human heat. In tropical and polar climates the appetite is keen, and the &s;to|mach re&s;i&s;ts the power of intoxicating liquors and of contagion. Seeds, eggs, im|perfect and young animals and maniacs, being, as it were, all &s;tomach, bear the ef|fects of heat and cold remarkably.</P>
<P>Certain degrees of heat and cold di&s;po&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="50">to &s;leep; which, in the ca&s;e of cold, or of external and internal poi&s;on, &s;ubduing the power of the &s;tomach, is apt to prove fatal. From the long fa&s;ting that is borne in &s;leep, the &s;low operation of a medicine, and the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;tools, the &s;tomach &s;eems le&s;s &s;en&s;ible in that &s;tate; the temperature is two degrees le&s;s; and cold is ea&s;ily caught in &s;leep.

Dy&s;peptics are apt to &s;tart from &s;leep or the article of &s;leep, and then other nervous af|fections, as a&s;thma, palpitation, epilep&s;y, and gout, are apt to happen, probably from the change in the &s;tate of the &s;tomach. It &s;eems to be only in occa&s;ional &s;tates of &s;tomach that fits from fixed cau&s;es, and other periodical di&s;ea&s;es, occur.</P>

In people with who&s;e &s;tomachs ho|ney, unctuous matter, or eggs di&s;agree, any application of the&s;e or of wax to a &s;ore, has been ob&s;erved likewi&s;e to di&s;|agree. Tartite or muriate of antimony ap|plied externally, as if taken into the &s;to|mach, excite vomiting, purging, and &s;weat|ing. Lead, copper, mercury, and other im|pre&s;&s;ions, produce vomiting and purging. It is &s;aid that bitters expel worms, that opium and tobacco produce ebriety, that bark cures ague, and that opium applied to the bare &s;urface has de&s;troyed life without be|ing ab&s;orbed. Ammonia weakened with oil, &s;o as to be applied to the &s;urface, fre|quently produces nau&s;ea and an univer&s;al &s;weat.

<P>The &s;tate of the tongue and mouth is always attended to as a mark of the &s;tate of &s;tomach, according to which the &s;en&s;ations of ta&s;te are various, and the &s;aliva and mucus vary in quantity, con|&s;i&s;tence, ta&s;te, &s;mell, and colour. Hence waterine&s;s, ptyali&s;m, &s;alivation, or foam|ing, is apt to occur on the &s;ight of grateful food in indige&s;tion, pyro&s;is, pregnancy, hy|drophobia, epilep&s;y, &s;curvy, fever, and &s;mall-pox; the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of which la&s;t is pain at &s;tomach, and the chief re|medy cold to the &s;urface.

<P>If infection be removed before the &s;pecific &s;tate of &s;tomach and ve&s;&s;el be induced, di|&s;ea&s;e does not take place; and the morbid &s;tate it&s;elf may, in the ca&s;e of &s;yphilis, be removed, for a time at lea&s;t, by copper, or by a cour&s;e of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate, or by fever, while the di&s;po&s;ition may remain, and break out with or without virulence.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;kin as well as &s;tomach, that a cold or hot body, or an a&s;tringent applied to either, is apt to pro|duce a contraction over all, and &s;top &s;ome haemorrhages. Fantonus mentions a man
<PB N="51" REF="54">in a fever, in whom bli&s;ter-i&s;&s;ues that had dried up, opened and di&s;charged anew, after the application of other bli&s;ters to di&s;tant parts. A pla&s;ter on &s;ome &s;kins ex|cites an eruption in other parts. After a &s;uppuration in the fore-arm, a &s;welling has taken place &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the arm-pit, the parotid, the leg, the knee, and the groin. A &s;welled te&s;ticle is allowed to be merely from irritation. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tumors takes place in the conglobate glands from the me&s;entery to the neck, and likewi&s;e from a compre&s;&s;ion of the in|guinal glands; in the inguinal and axillary from irritation at the toes and fingers, with or without infection; and in the neck and behind the ears from a &s;cratch, a bli&s;ter, or tinea capitis in the neighbour|hood. The pain of a wound, burn, or brui&s;e, is &s;ometimes alleviated as pain be|gins in another part. Pain, &s;pa&s;m, inflam|mation,
<PB N="52" REF="55">and other &s;tates are apt to &s;hift, as are ulcers, that is peculiar &s;tates of ve&s;&s;&s;el with peculiar a&s;&s;imilation as the ichor of cancer, the chee&s;y-like matter of &s;crofula, and the &s;tony matter of gout.</P>
<P>Noxious matter &s;eems either rejected by the ab&s;orbents at the &s;urface, or a&s;&s;imilated before it meet the chyle in the thoracic duct. A mild &s;ub&s;tance like milk or mucilage in|jected into a vein, is apt to throw the &s;y&s;tem into convul&s;ions. The fle&s;h of an animal killed by a poi&s;onous bite or arrow, affords whole&s;ome food; during a cour&s;e of chalybeates no &s;uperfluous iron is de|tected in the chyle or blood; bile circulat|ing in jaundice does not produce giddine&s;s, dimne&s;s of &s;ight, &amp;c. as when in the &s;to|mach; colouring and odorous particles, as of madder, logwood, turpentine, garlic, or a&s;paragus, circulate without producing any effect; in &s;yphilis the fluids, and even &s;e|condary ulcers do not generally infect; and
<PB N="53" REF="56">though a mercurial may lo&s;e, and &s;ulphur acquire oxygen in the &s;y&s;tem, yet it is not alleged that either is found there but in its mild &s;tate.</P>
<P>A morbid &s;tate or a fever, attended with inflammation, eruption or ulcer, often takes place &s;uddenly, and runs its cour&s;e without any infection, applied or generated, or any cau&s;e or remedy which acts on the fluids; in the ca&s;e of infection the &s;ymp|toms, as the variolous eruption, &s;ometimes do not appear, and &s;ometimes continue to appear when the &s;tate or the fever is gone; and are affected by external temperature, while the internal one continues the &s;ame; &s;ome very infectious di&s;ea&s;es, as the yaws, admit of cure from mere attention to the general health; an infectious irritation, like others, takes time before it affects the re&s;i&s;ting and a&s;&s;imilating power, &s;o as to produce the &s;pecific &s;tate of ve&s;&s;el and &s;pe|cific matter; during the variolous and &s;y|philitic
<PB N="54" REF="57">&s;tate, though there is nothing to prevent ab&s;orption, any new infection &s;eems to have no con&s;titutional effect; in the ca&s;e of &s;mall-pox, yaws, and &s;ome other infec|tions, the &s;y&s;tem becomes afterwards in|&s;u&s;ceptible of their action, as it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, does of that of accu&s;tomed ones, as &s;pirits, opium, tobacco, and even febrile contagion; and no &s;atisfying account is given why the ab&s;orption, multiplication, or a&s;&s;imilation, with the other effects of an infectious particle are not more immediate, and in proportion to its quantity, and why after ab&s;orption, it &s;hould in any ca&s;e fail to a&s;&s;imilate.</P>
<P>Morbific matter does not &s;eem to be a cau&s;e of gout or of other di&s;ea&s;es, called hereditary, as mania, epilep&s;y, or &s;crofula, which are not infectious, and in which, as in all other ca&s;es, the &s;tate of the fluids mu&s;t depend on that of the &s;olids. Gout often attacks per|&s;ons in &s;eemingly good health preceded
<PB N="55" REF="58">perhaps only by &s;light &s;ymptoms of &s;ome affection of the alimentary canal, is &s;ubject to frequent, &s;udden, and di&s;tant tran&s;lations, affecting the joints with inflammation, but the &s;tomach with a &s;tate &s;o oppo&s;ite, that highly &s;timulating cordials are taken with relief; and no antidote to gouty matter there, whether &s;uppo&s;ed acid or otherwi&s;e acrimonious, was ever thought of.</P>
<P>The remedies in &s;yphilis tend to bring the &s;tomach and con&s;equently the ve&s;&s;els from their &s;yphilitic &s;tate, and to keep the functions in a proper condition till the im|pre&s;&s;ion cea&s;e to operate, the morbid &s;tate be changed, and the habit overcome. The remedies affect the a&s;&s;imilating organs, and except perhaps the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate, im|prove them, as appears from the corpulence to which they di&s;po&s;e. Infants have re|markably a&s;&s;imilating and re&s;i&s;ting powers, &s;laver a great deal, are not ea&s;ily affected by &s;yphilis, or ea&s;ily &s;alivated by mercury, and
<PB N="56" REF="59">are ea&s;ily cured. Mercury, and opium when it &s;ucceeds, &s;eem to put the &s;tomach in a pe|culiar &s;tate, &s;omewhat, perhaps, like that of infancy, and the &s;alivation does not ap|pear to be from ab&s;orption any more than when it occurs from an emetic, pregnancy, or worms; or than giddine&s;s is when it ari&s;es from the u&s;e of hemlock.</P>
<P>Inflammation by mu&s;tard, &amp;c. does not excite &s;trangury, as cantharides are apt to do. It often cea&s;es the moment the bli&s;ter is removed, the effect of the impre&s;&s;ion is allayed by a poultice, or the &s;tomach is &s;oothed by a diluent, or by camphorated oil applied to the &s;urface. Cantharides in|ternally relieve paralytic &s;trangury, and in|continence of urine; &s;trangury frequently occurs from affections of the &s;tomach, as ga&s;tritis; and the uva ur&s;i, alkali, or &s;uper|carbonated alkali, who&s;e effects &s;eem chiefly confined to the &s;tomach, occa&s;ionally re|lieve even fits of the &s;tone.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="60">
<P>Contagions, whether mar&s;hy, human, or &s;pecific, are &s;ometimes traced to &s;mells, as a cadaverous one, a heavy earthy one, that of the confluent &s;mall-pox, dy&s;enteric &s;tools; or they may induce the febrile &s;tate, the only &s;teady character of which is weakne&s;s, though the impre&s;&s;ion do not ju&s;t excite the &s;tate of &s;en&s;ation. It may be in a way &s;imilar to what happens in idio&s;yncra&s;ies in regard to chee&s;e, a cat, &amp;c. or that of the in&s;en&s;ible action of various irritations, as of worms. A gentleman who cannot bear being in a room where there is any chee&s;e, though he does not &s;ee or &s;mell it in the lea&s;t, in&s;tantly feels a &s;en&s;e of weak|ne&s;s, after &s;ome time, &s;ickne&s;s with a cold &s;weat, and faints if he endeavour to brave it. In this way contagion may, through the organ of &s;mell, affect the &s;tomach and &s;y&s;tem. Inoculated, it produces the &s;pecific &s;tate, inflammation and &s;up|puration, and in the ca&s;e of &s;mall-pox
<PB N="58" REF="61">without predi&s;po&s;ition, the &s;tomach does not yield too much, and its energy is kept up by cold on the &s;urface, &s;o that a &s;light eruption happens &s;ometimes without fever. Heat on a part &s;eems to increa&s;e the vario|lous &s;tate of ve&s;&s;el. Cool air on the &s;urface recovers per&s;ons from the &s;tate induced by carbonic, azotic, and other noxious airs, the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of which is vomiting; from &s;yncope, and from the &s;till-born &s;tate, the fir&s;t exertion from which is &s;een to be about the region of the &s;tomach; and the cold &s;eems to operate, as in di&s;charges of blood, by exciting the &s;tomach from its pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate.
