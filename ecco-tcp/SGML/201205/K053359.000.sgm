<HEAD>THE Translator's Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE general curio&s;ity, which has at times manife&s;ted it&s;elf among Phy&s;iologi&s;ts, to di&s;cover the nature of that proce&s;s, by which the animal part of the creation is formed, and the difficulties which oppo&s;e them|&s;elves to &s;uch re&s;earches, might be con&s;idered as &s;ufficient motives for
<PB N="vi" REF="4">tran&s;lating any new work, who&s;e prin|cipal view con&s;i&s;ts in endeavouring to correct &s;ome prevailing errors, or to enlarge our ideas in regard to the &s;ub|ject in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The following E&s;&s;ay claims our attention in both the&s;e re&s;pects. It may be con&s;idered not only as an attempt at a refutation of one of the mo&s;t favourite hypothe&s;es on the &s;ub|ject of Generation; I mean that of the Evolution of pre-exi&s;ting organic germs; but al&s;o, as an attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h, upon the ba&s;is of experi|ment, a better, and more con&s;i&s;tent theory.</P>
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
<P>The great knowledge and exten|&s;ive information, which my valuable and learned Friend the Author po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, not only in phy&s;iology, and com|parative anatomy, but in every branch of natural hi&s;tory, and, which he has &s;ufficiently evinced in his numerous writings; at the &s;ame time, that they prepo&s;&s;e&s;s us with the idea, that he is well fitted for &s;uch an enquiry, &s;erve al&s;o, as a further ju&s;tification, if a ju&s;tification be nece&s;&s;ary, of the part which I have taken in it. Whe|ther I have executed my ta&s;k faith|fully, I mu&s;t leave to others to de|cide.</P>
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
<P>That the conclu&s;ions of Spallan|zani, who&s;e works may be con&s;idered as the chief &s;upport of the theory of pre-exi&s;ting organic germs, require both &s;ome degree of re&s;triction, and a more accurate examination, than they have hitherto met with, will appear evident from the Second Section of the following E&s;&s;ay, where the doctrine of Evolution is particu|larly noticed.</P>
<P>If the admirers of Haller, Bonnet, and Spallanzani, be &s;urpri&s;ed at the manner in which their doctrines are attacked, they are to con&s;ider, that
<PB N="ix" REF="7">controver&s;y never yet injured the cau&s;e of truth, and that by open and candid examination alone, we are often able to remove the deceptions of prejudice and error. Never did a well-founded theory &s;uffer by the mo&s;t &s;evere, and critical inve&s;tigation; on the contrary, nothing is better calculated to di&s;|cover its value, and e&s;tabli&s;h its re|putation.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that in tran|&s;lating the compound word <HI>(Bildung|&s;trieb),</HI> I have been obliged to make u&s;e of a Latin expre&s;&s;ion. The word <HI>Ni&s;us,</HI> which conveys the full &s;en&s;e of

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the various Hypothe&s;es, by which the Phenomena of Generation have been attempted to be explained.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is the nature of that change, which takes place within a female, when after having experienced the mo&s;t delightful of all &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and being duly impregnated, form, and exi&s;tence are about to be given to her offspring?</P>
<PB N="2" REF="11">
<P>Few que&s;tions hare ever awakened more general, and more ardent curio&s;ity than this; for however romantic it may appear to attempt to a&s;certain the ob&s;ervations, and thoughts of our fir&s;t parents, yet the &s;uppo&s;ition is natural, that the wonderful effects, and as it were repeated creations produced by the indulgence of this in&s;tinct, mu&s;t fir&s;t have excited their &s;urpri&s;e, and then led them to a train of re|flections.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the innumerable times the phenomena of generation have occurred &s;ince the days of Adam, it becomes a humiliating reproach to the under&s;tanding of his de&s;cen|dants, that during all that long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, they have not been able to give any &s;atisfactory explanation of the matter; e&s;pe|cially as it appears to have &s;oon become a very early &s;ubject of &s;tudy with &s;peculative men: at lea&s;t mo&s;t of the phy&s;iological frag|ments of the ancient philo&s;ophers and phy&s;i|cians,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">For in&s;tance, tho&s;e of Orpheus, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, &amp;c.</NOTE>,
<PB N="3" REF="12">which have been handed down to us, con&s;i&s;t in general of inquiries into the my&s;teries of generation; and indeed &s;ince that, there is hardly a period in which the &s;ame kind of re&s;earches have not been more or le&s;s pro|&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>Even in the darke&s;t times of the middle ages, when the &s;pirit of inquiry &s;eemed almo&s;t entirely lo&s;t in the lethargy of mona&s;tic bar|bari&s;m, this &s;ubject appears every now and then to have awakened a &s;park of curio&s;ity, and to have &s;timulated &s;ome of the holy fathers of tho&s;e times to the compo&s;ition of very &s;en&s;ual and ob&s;cene works, &s;ome of which have reached our days<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Such as that of Pope John <HI>XXth,</HI> or Bi&s;hop Abert to Great, or whatever holy father of the church it was, who wrote that vile book de Se|cretis Mulierum. One may al&s;o add Mich. Scotus, the &s;crutinizer of natural things.</NOTE>, and &s;erve to prove
<PB N="4" REF="13">that their authors were at lea&s;t intere&s;ted in the theoretical, if not in the practical part of generation.</P>
<P>We are not therefore to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that the attempt to &s;olve this great problem of nature encrea&s;ed rapidly, beyond the power of numbering, leaving no pa&s;&s;age untrod which afforded any hopes of leading to a &s;olution of the my&s;tery; hence there hardly exi&s;ts an|other &s;pot in the whole region of natural knowledge, &s;urrounded by more intricate la|byrinths, or fal&s;e guides than this.</P>
<P>Drelingcourt, a teacher of Boerhaave's, collected no le&s;s than two hundred and &s;ixty-two vague hypothe&s;es on generation, from the writings of earlier writers.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the a&s;toni&s;hing variety, and number of paths, which &s;eemed to lead to the &s;olution of this phy&s;iological problem, yet they are all of them but &s;o many branches of two principal roads; the one conducting to the
<PB N="5" REF="14">doctrine of <HI>Evolution,</HI> the other to that of <HI>Epigeni&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>It is either &s;uppo&s;ed that the prepared, but at the &s;ame time unorganized rudiments of the foetus, fir&s;t begins to be gradually or|ganized when it arrives at its place of de&s;ti|nation at a due time, and under the nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances. This is the doctrine of Epi|geni&s;is;</P>
<P>Or, we deny every &s;ort of generation, and believe that the germ of every animal, and every plant that ever has lived and ever will live, were all created at one and the &s;ame time, namely, at the beginning of the world; and that all that is nece&s;&s;ary is, that one generation &s;hould be developed after the other. Such is the celebrated theory of Evolution.</P>
<P>But the manner in which this evolu|tion happens, has been differently accounted for.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="15">
<P>Heraclitus, &s;urnamed the gloomy, and Hippocrates, or whoever the author of tho&s;e books on regimen was, which appeared un|der his name, together with many of their followers, were of opinion, that tho&s;e germs were &s;cattered up and down the whole globe, where they wandered about, each in &s;earch of the genitals of a ready made relation of their own kind, which having once found, they took lodgement there, threw off their enve|lopement, and now became fit for being them&s;elves evolved.</P>
<P>If we except the impo&s;ing name of the authors to whom this theory is a&s;cribed, it has little el&s;e to recommend it to our atten|tion. It is &s;o completely built on fanciful &s;uppo&s;itions, that it would be difficult to &s;ay, what hypothe&s;is might not be credited were we to yield the &s;malle&s;t faith to &s;uch a doc|trine. The late profe&s;&s;or Ge&s;ner, who wrote a commentary on this romance of Hippo|crates, apologizes for him&s;elf by adopting the <HI>bon mot</HI> of Queen Chri&s;tina, <Q>"that the chi|meras
<PB N="7" REF="16">of the ancients were ju&s;t as good as tho&s;e of the moderns."</Q></P>
<P>More approbation has been given to two other theories of evolution, according to each of which, the germs did not wander about, but tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind were all neatly wrapt up, and enca&s;ed one within an|other, &s;o that the fir&s;t parent of each animal, and plant was &s;uppo&s;ed to contain all the germs of every &s;ucceeding generation; co|pulation only &s;erving to awaken them to their &s;tate of evolution. The only difference be|tween the two theories was, that the one &s;uppo&s;ed the germs to inhabit the te&s;ticles of their father, whil&s;t the other would have it, that they re&s;ided in the ovaria of their mo|ther.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the art of making magni|fying gla&s;&s;es di&s;covered, and by that means an opening procured to a new world in the creation, than the novelty of the di&s;|covery, and facility of its application, by af|fording
<PB N="8" REF="17">an opportunity to a number of micro|&s;copical experiments, naturally led to the mo&s;t unexpected &s;ights.</P>
<P>Among the great amateurs of this kind of amu&s;ement, was one Ludwig von Ham|mon, a young man born at Dantzig, who during the time of his &s;tudying medicine at Leyden, and in the cour&s;e of his micro&s;copical pur&s;uits, di&s;covered in the month of Augu&s;t 1677, in a drop of the &s;emen of a cock re|cently di&s;&s;ected, a kind of ocean, in which &s;wam thou&s;ands of little lively active animals.</P>
<P>The &s;ame unexpected phenomenon was al&s;o ob&s;erved in the ripe &s;emen of other male animals, and in the&s;e animalculae were im|mediately thought to be &s;een, the germs of &s;ub&s;equent perfect, animals. By this di&s;covery, a key was &s;uppo&s;ed to be found, which would unlock the whole my&s;tery of generation.</P>
<P>Now I cannot conceive how &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ed philo&s;ophers, and natural hi&s;torians have
<PB N="9" REF="18">been led to deny life and voluntary motion to tho&s;e animalculae; but I am &s;till more at a lo&s;s to imagine, how another &s;et of philo&s;ophers have been induced to dignify the&s;e animalculae of a &s;tagnant animal fluid, to the high rank of the organized germs of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive gene|rations.</P>
<P>Without entering into a long and tedious detail of all the doubts and difficulties, which ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to &s;o &s;ingular a theory, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with adding a few reflec|tions, which to the mo&s;t uninformed readers, will appear &s;ufficient for calling in que&s;tion this imaginary dignity of the animalculae of the &s;emen of animals.</P>
<P>How comes it that the animalculae of the &s;emen of animals the mo&s;t nearly related, differ &s;o much from each other, whil&s;t &s;carce any two things re&s;emble one another &s;o much as the animalculae of animals, the mo&s;t op|po&s;ite to each other, both in nature and form?
<PB N="10" REF="19">For in&s;tance, the animalculae in the &s;emen of frogs, as repre&s;ented by Mr. von Gleichen, bear no kind of re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the common newt, as repre&s;ented by Spallan|zani; whereas on the other hand, two drops of water cannot re&s;emble each other more &s;trongly, than the animalculae of the &s;emen of a man, and tho&s;e of an a&s;s, as repre&s;ented by the fir&s;t of the&s;e accurate ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P>This &s;ame modern advocate for the digni|ty of the&s;e animalculae, has already di&s;covered two kinds of them in the &s;ame drop of &s;emen of a frog, and yet both of them are perfectly di&s;|tinct from tho&s;e which Roe&s;el repre&s;ents as animalculae of the &s;emen of the &s;ame animal; be&s;ides the former were not only di&s;covered in the ve&s;iculae &s;eminales, but al&s;o in the kidneys: mere appearances, as evinced by the irregular and uncertain &s;hape of the inhabi|tants of the male &s;emen, and which irregu|larity and uncertainty refutes their pretended dignity &s;o completely, that one might as well

<P>Long before the animalculae of the &s;emen were di&s;covered, Jo&s;eph de Aromatariis found out a third way to explain the my&s;tery of ge|neration, by means of the theory of evolution; I mean that one which &s;uppo&s;es the ovaria of every female, even before impregnation, to contain a whole provi&s;ion of organized molecules or germs, perfectly ready for evo|lution.</P>
<P>Swammerdam al&s;o adopted this opinion, but owing to the great figure which the
<PB N="13" REF="22">animalculae of the &s;emen &s;oon afterwards made in the world, it remained but little known until two very di&s;tingui&s;hed authors, Haller, and Bonnet, at once rai&s;ed its repu|tation.</P>
<P>According to this theory we, and indeed all the children of Adam, were at one time <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> pent up in the two ovaria of our common mother Eve. There we lay, as it were a&s;leep, and although a&s;toni&s;hing little creatures, yet completely organized bodies, and perfect miniatures of the forms we have &s;ince a&s;&s;umed; for &s;ays Haller, <Q>"<HI>All our vi&s;cera, and the bones them&s;elves were then already formed, although in a kind of fluid &s;tate.</HI>"</Q> That which we call impregnation, is nothing el&s;e than the action of awakening the germ from its lethargic &s;tate by means of the male &s;emen, which &s;timulates the little creature's heart to the fir&s;t pul&s;ation; and &s;o on.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="23">
<P>The &s;ame kind of idea has lately in|duced a very celebrated naturali&s;t of Geneva, and a warm advocate of this theory, to plan out for us a hi&s;tory of organized bodies pre|vious to the &s;tate of impregnation, from which we learn, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that we are all much older than what we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves to be, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that all mankind are exactly the &s;ame age, the great grandfather not a &s;econd older than the younge&s;t of his great grand children, <HI>thirdly,</HI> that this re&s;pectable age, which we are all of, may be about &s;ix thou&s;and years. The &s;ame natural hi&s;torian al&s;o agrees en|tirely in opinion with Bazin; that &s;ince that charming long &s;eries of years, when we were all packed together along with Cain and Abel, and the other two hundred thou&s;and million of men, which according to the be&s;t calcu|lations, have &s;ince that period gone <HI>quo pius Aeneas quo Tellus dives et Ancus;</HI> in a word, &s;ince the fir&s;t creation, during which time we have been in a kind of lethargic &s;leep, though not entirely without motion; that
<PB N="15" REF="24">during the whole fifty-&s;even centuries, I &s;ay, previous to our being awakened by the above|mentioned &s;timulus, we were according to Bazin's opinion, always growing a little and little: for in&s;tance, we were mo&s;t probably rather a little bigger at the time we lay be&s;ide Cain's nieces, than when all their uncles and aunts were of the party, as it is very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that we mu&s;t then have been con&s;i|derably more pinched for room. In this manner our apartment became gradually more ea&s;y, and commodious in proportion as our forefathers were evolved, and we agreed with it, for we kept continually &s;tretching our&s;elves more and more, until the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of evolution came at la&s;t to our turn!!</P>
<P>However extravagant and romantic &s;uch conclu&s;ions mu&s;t appear, yet they follow as natural deductions from the premi&s;es of the theory, which gave ri&s;e to them. In &s;upport of this theory, its mo&s;t celebrated abettors, Haller, and Spallanzani, adduced many ex|periments, and ob&s;ervations, which we &s;hall
<PB N="16" REF="25">examine more particularly in the next Sec|tion. When we con&s;ider how conclu&s;ive and &s;triking the&s;e ob&s;ervations appear to be at fir&s;t &s;ight, we &s;hall not wonder at the general a&s;&s;ent, which during the&s;e thirty years pa&s;t, has been given to the doctrine of the pre-exi&s;tence of complete organized mo|lecules in the ovaria of females before impreg|nation. I my&s;elf not only believed in the truth of it, but defended it in many of my writings; &s;o that in fact the pre&s;ent little volume contains a confe&s;&s;ion of my former errors, in regard to which, I wi&s;h that may be true, which Mr. de Luc &s;ays &s;ome where or other, that, <Q>"An error once detected, becomes a more material truth, than many po&s;itive ones, which we immediately ac|knowledge to be &s;uch."</Q></P>
<P>The unexpected &s;ucce&s;s of a &s;mall ex|periment, which I made, however, with a view of a&s;certaining the truth of the doctrine of evolution, fir&s;t brought me back to the point from which I ought to have &s;et out, and
<PB N="17" REF="26">opened a new road to a very oppo&s;ite doc|trine. He who thus fights with nature, may from an unexpected &s;ight, often di&s;cover her mo&s;t concealed trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>What gave occa&s;ion to the in&s;tituting the experiment was as follows: In one of my walks during &s;ome holidays which I &s;pent in the country, I di&s;covered in a &s;tream, a &s;ort of green armed polypus, which differed from the common green kind by its long &s;piral body, and by having &s;hort and rather im|moveable tentaculae. With the wonders of this little animal, I intended to amu&s;e my country friends. The delightful warm &s;um|mer weather which then prevailed, and the hardy con&s;titution of the polypus it&s;elf, fa|voured the experiments which we made, to di&s;cover its power of reproduction &s;o much, that the act of renewal of the parts became almo&s;t perceptible. By the &s;econd and third day, the maimed and divided animal was &s;o many new ones, each with arms, body, tail,
<PB N="18" REF="27">&amp;c. But we plainly remarked that the re|generated animals, although &s;upplied with plenty of proper food, were always much &s;maller than before, and a mutilated rump, always dimini&s;hed very evidently, both in length and diameter, in proportion as the lo&s;t parts were renewed<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">It is probable that this circum&s;tance has been either totally overlocked by &s;uch as were en|gaged in ob&s;erving phenomena of greater magnitude in the hi&s;tory of this animal, or if it has been ob|&s;erved by any, it does not &s;eem to have appeared to them, of &s;ufficient importance to be noticed. That attentive, and accurate ob&s;erver Roe&s;el, however, &s;eems to have noticed this fact. Vide Hi&s;t. der Poly|pen, in the third vol. of the In&s;ecten-belu&s;tigungen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after my return to town, I was called to a patient who had a caries. The di&s;ea&s;e occupied the lower end of the femur immediately above the knee, and had cau&s;ed
<PB N="19" REF="28">a pretty exten&s;ive and deep ulcer. It healed gradually, but in proportion as the wound filled up, and the cicactrix formed, all the &s;urrounding parts &s;unk &s;o, that the edge of the cicatrix being almo&s;t on an equality with the neighbouring parts, the whole formed a broad, though rather &s;uperficial excavation<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">An ob&s;ervation which has been al&s;o made by Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>ON the 13th of May 1758 was read before the Royal Society of Sciences at G&ouml;ttingen, the celebrated paper of Baron von Haller, (then pre&s;ident of the &s;ociety) on the formation of the heart in the embryo, in which it was believed an <HI>argumentum cru|cis</HI> was offered in &s;upport of the doctrine of pre-exi&s;ting germs.

<PB N="34" REF="43">
<P>In acknowledging that I my&s;elf, as well as &s;ome hundred other phy&s;iologi&s;ts, and natu|rali&s;ts, looked on this celebrated ob&s;ervation as the foundation &s;ton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the theory of evo|lution; I hink I need make the le&s;s ceremony in expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment how we could have allowed our&s;elves, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to attribute &s;o much force to an a&s;&s;ertion which ab&s;olutely proves nothing!</P>
<P>For, granting it to be fully proved that there exi&s;ted a continuation between the membrane and ve&s;&s;els of the chick and yolk, (granting it, I &s;ay; for, the fact as the mo&s;t accurate, and &s;crupulous inve&s;tigation teaches, &s;till remains uncertain, as every one will rea|dily acknowledge who has taken the pains of examining fecundated eggs,) yet it does not follow that the membrane and ve&s;&s;els, even if they really were a continuation of each other, co-exi&s;ted from the beginning. Do we not &s;ee many in&s;tances in organized bodies where this la&s;t mentioned circum&s;tance exi&s;ts, and yet where it is impo&s;&s;ible to grant
<PB N="35" REF="44">the &s;uppo&s;ition which has been drawn as a conclu&s;ion from it. For in&s;tance, all tho&s;e &s;ingular vegetable productions, which are cau&s;ed by the puncture of certain infects in many plants. Thus the Spongiae cyno&s;batae are produced entirely in con&s;equence of the puncture of the Cynips in the ro&s;e-bu&s;h. The bark of this &s;hrub is continued over this &s;pongy and quite <HI>accidental</HI> production; nay, if we take, and cut any fre&s;h branch which has &s;ome of the&s;e &s;pongy bodies on it, we &s;hall find that the wood of the branch appears to be an evident continuation of the woody part of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances. But &s;hall we from hence conclude, that this accidental produc|tion originally co-exi&s;ted with the &s;hrub it&s;elf, and that in every trunk, and every branch of every ro&s;e-bu&s;h in the world, the enveloped germs of innumerable &s;pongiae cyno&s;batae &s;hould have always lain there like &s;o much hidden wealth, and would have always remained &s;o until the thou&s;and thou|&s;andth part of them were by chance excited
<PB N="36" REF="45">to evolution by the benevolent puncture of a little cynips.</P>
<P>Again, in the animal kingdom, do we not often &s;ee after an accidental inflammation of any of the vi&s;cera, a new membrane formed as it were by the effu&s;ion of the lymphatic part of the blood; and in the cour&s;e of a few days, do we not ob&s;erve many blood-ve&s;&s;els produced in this membrane, which ana&s;tomo&s;e with the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the neighbouring vi&s;cera; and yet it would be ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els co-exi&s;ted from the fir&s;t with the old ones. And for fear that it be objected to us, that the&s;e are mere preternatural appearances in the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of animals, we beg them to recall the late celebrated membrana deci|dua of Dr. Hunter, which after a fruitful impregnation, lines the whole cavity of the uterus, and who&s;e blood-ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially where the umbilical chord is in&s;erted in the placenta, are mo&s;t evidently connected
<PB N="37" REF="46">and ana&s;tomo&s;e with the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the mother.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the new formed mem|branes, and their blood-ve&s;&s;els are the mere productions of the neighbouring vi&s;cera, which renders it probable, that the mem|brane and ve&s;&s;els of the embryo in a fecun|dated egg, are produced in like manner from the membrane and ve&s;&s;els of the yolk.</P>
<P>Mr. Paul<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">In the preface to the 8th vol. of the Col|lection Academique par &eacute;trangere, <HI>p. 22. &s;qq.</HI></NOTE>, a natural hi&s;torian of great penetration, hath objected to Haller's de|mon&s;tration, that allowing the membranes of the yolk with its invi&s;ible ve&s;&s;els to have pre-exi&s;ted in the hen, yet it is po&s;&s;ible that the embryo is only formed during incubation, and that its blood-ve&s;&s;els afterward unite with the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the membrane of the yolk, and thus form an ana&s;tomo&s;is.</P>

<P>Whoever has taken the trouble, accu|rately, to examine the &s;pawn of the frog mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the idea of demon&s;trating the little black points contained in it to be &s;o many complete formed tadpoles, partakes greatly of Brother Peters's method of rea&s;oning in the Tale of the Tub, where he demon&s;trates to his brothers that the brown loaf is a piece of ex|cellent roa&s;t mutton.</P>

<P>But experience &s;upplies me with another &s;ource of facts, which may be u&s;ed as argu|ments again&s;t this theory, and which, to unprejudiced, and judicious readers, ought to be &s;ufficient whereby to a&s;certain its true degree of probability.</P>

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible however to di&s;cover any thing before the third week after concep|tion, which any cautious and creditable ob&s;er|ver would pre&s;ume to pronounce a human em|bryo, and in the fecundated egg nothing can be ob&s;erved, which has even the mo&s;t di&s;tant

<P>A child is born with a hydrocephalus, occa&s;ioned by mere accidental circum&s;tances; &s;uch for in&s;tance as the frequent, and too violent connection of the father with the mother, during the time of her ge&s;tation. Owing to this di&s;ea&s;e, the cranium becomes preternaturally di&s;tended, and immence &s;paces are left between the very thin, and greatly di&s;tended bones. In order to remedy this, nature forms detached o&s;&s;eous points in the&s;e inter&s;tices, which points, at la&s;t become true <HI>o&s;&s;a triquetra,</HI> filling up all the dangerous voids, and uniting all the bones of the head together.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>o&s;&s;a triquetra</HI> however do not belong to the natural &s;tructure of the foetus, and are very &s;eldom to be met with in the &s;culls of &s;avages, or of brute animals. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible therefore that they &s;hould have pre|exi&s;ted in the organic germ: and yet they are as perfect bones as any others of the head, having true, and well formed &s;utures. The &s;utures of the&s;e bones are not always locked

<P>The conclu&s;ion which naturally follows, is, that if perfect bones, new and preter|natural joints, new organized and va&s;cular membranes can be formed, where there was no ground for &s;uppo&s;ing a pre-exi&s;ting germ, what nece&s;&s;ity is there for this doctrine of envelopement?</P>
<P>But the phenomena which occur in the generation of mules, &s;o completely re&s;ute all our ideas of pre-exi&s;ting organic germs, that one is at a lo&s;s to imagine, how, after a due attention to this &s;ubject, &s;uch a theory &s;hould
<PB N="56" REF="65">have found any &s;erious abettors. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;ingle experiment, &s;uch as that of Mr. Koelreuter, who by repeatedly produ|cing prolific ba&s;tard plants, transformed one &s;pecies of tobacco (<HI>nicotiana ru&s;tica</HI>) into another (<HI>nicotiana paniculata</HI>) &s;o completely, that it had not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to its maternal parent; that &s;uch an experiment, I &s;ay mu&s;t cure the mo&s;t partial advocate for the theory of evolution, of his error. This excellent ob&s;erver, by artificially impregna|ting the fir&s;t &s;pecies of tobacco with the farina of the la&s;t mentioned, obtained prolific ba&s;tard &s;eeds from it, and with the plants which &s;prung from the&s;e, he repeated the &s;ame experiment, impregnating them with the farina of the Nicotiana paniculata. As the plants which he procured from the &s;eeds of this la&s;t combination, differed more from the original maternal plant, he repeated the &s;ame proce&s;s with it, and proceeded to do &s;o with every new offspring, untill he obtained &s;ix plants, which in every re&s;pect appeared perfectly &s;imilar to the <HI>paniculata;</HI> &s;o that in the cla&s;&s;ical work,
<PB N="57" REF="66">in which he gives a narrative of this, he appears perfectly ju&s;tifiable in entitling it, <HI>A complete metamorpho&s;is of one natural &s;pecies of plants into another.</HI></P>
<P>I know perfectly well, that the favour|ers of the theory of evolution endeavour to explain the production of ba&s;tards, or mules, by &s;aying, that the male &s;emen, be&s;ides its &s;timulating power of awakening the female germs from their &s;tate of &s;tupor, and inactivi|ty; al&s;o a&s;cribe to it certain <HI>formative</HI> powers, by which the germ may be altered in a certain degree, &s;o as &s;o re&s;emble the father a little. But what in the name of Heaven is &s;uch a &s;ubterfuge than the &s;ilent acknowledgement of the in&s;ufficiency of the germ theory, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to formative powers, in order to extricate it? If the&s;e formative powers, however, are &s;o &s;trong as totally to change the &s;tructure and appear|ance of the maternal germ, and that in the cour&s;e of a few generations, it is rather diffi|cult to conceive the utility of &s;uch a theory.</P>

<P>No one can be more fully per&s;uaded of the immen&s;e gap which exi&s;ts between the organi&s;ed, and unorgani&s;ed, between the ani|mated, and the inanimate world, than I am; and although I have the greate&s;t re&s;pect for the penetration of tho&s;e who di&s;cover a gradual &s;cale of a&s;cent and de&s;cent in the works of nature, yet I confe&s;s I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s how they make it pa&s;s from organic to inorganic bodies. Such a reflection, how|ever, ought by no means, to deter us from em|ploying the phenomena of either of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of bodies for explaining the phenomena of the other: and &s;o far do I con&s;ider it as an argument, not of the lea&s;t importance, for

<P>For only to adduce one or two in&s;tances, we find nothing more elegant, than certain metallic cry&s;tallizations, which as to their external a&s;pect, bear &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance to certain organized bodies, that they become a very good example for explaining to us the manner in which bodies are formed from rude and unorganized matter.

<P>The&s;e as I have already &s;aid, are ad|duced as mere examples of the exi&s;tence of a Formative Principle in unorganized bodies.</P>
<P>And now for the true formative effort in the animated world.</P>
<P>I know no means &s;o well calculated for rendering the exi&s;tence, and activity of this ni&s;us evident to an impartial eye, as to ob|&s;erve the origin and progre&s;s of &s;uch orga|nized bodies, which increa&s;e &s;o rapidly in bulk, that the action of the growth becomes almo&s;t evident; and which are of &s;o delicate and &s;emitran&s;parent a texture, as to be capable of being evidently &s;een through with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a micro&s;cope, and a due degree of light.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="71">
<P>The vegetable kingdom &s;upplies us with a very good example of this kind, in the &s;imple production of a mo&s;t &s;imple water plant, <HI>(conferva fontinalis)</HI> which is com|monly to be met with every &s;pring, in wells, ponds, and &s;prings, or in the wooden pipes through which water flows.</P>
<P>The whole plant con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;ingle uniform &s;traight fine thread, of a bright green colour, and about half an inch in length, and who&s;e under extremity is generally in&s;erted in a bed of &s;lime. As the&s;e threads, however, are extremely numerous, and grow very clo&s;e together, they look like a very fine fur of the mo&s;t beautiful green colour, with which con&s;iderable &s;paces of the places above mentioned are &s;ometimes covered.</P>
<P>I have attentively ob&s;erved the propaga|tion of this water plant in the beginning of the &s;pring, and to me it appeared to take place in the following manner. The upper end
<PB N="64" REF="72">of the fibrile began gradually to &s;well, and divide into a number of &s;mall round points, which at la&s;t di&s;engaged them&s;elves from the parental thread, and in the number of &s;ome thou&s;ands, attached them&s;elves to the &s;ides of the gla&s;s in which I made the experiment. Soon afterwards, the&s;e round bodies began to &s;hoot out a &s;mall point, which almo&s;t vi&s;ibly lengthened till they had acquired their due &s;ize. All this took place in the &s;pace of twice twenty-four hours, counting from the fir&s;t moment that the end of the old thread began to &s;well.</P>
<P>Both the rapid growth of this plant, and its tran&s;parent texture, afforded me means of di&s;covering not only its &s;tructure, but al&s;o the &s;lighte&s;t changes that took place in it. This kind of mo&s;s is equally &s;imple inter|nally, as externally; and under the &s;tronge&s;t magnifying powers, and by the be&s;t light, we can di&s;cover nothing el&s;e than a fine ve|&s;icular appearance, like a green froth, &s;ur|rounded by a very thin delicate membrane.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="73">
<P>But in &s;pite of the di&s;tinctne&s;s of texture of the little green points which adhered to the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el, there was nothing to be &s;een like the germ of an enveloped filament in them, &s;uch as was &s;oon to be produced from it: but only when the little round body had attained a certain degree of perfection, a &s;mall &s;hoot &s;eemed to &s;pring out of it, in &s;uch a manner, that its act of evolution &s;eemed to be promoted merely by that part of the ve&s;icular texture of the round point, which was mo&s;t contiguous to the filament, pa&s;&s;ing gradually over to it. As the filament encrea&s;ed in length, the little round body gradually de|crea&s;ed in magnitude, and became of a paler colour, &s;o that at la&s;t, when the filament had arrived at its full growth, there remained ju&s;t a perceptible &s;welling at the inferior end, and which &s;erved as a root to the new filament.</P>
<P>With an equal degree of di&s;tinctne&s;s with which the progre&s;s of the Formative Ni&s;us of this plant becomes con&s;picuous, we can al&s;o clearly di&s;cover it in many animals;

Its texture is uniform, and &s;imple, and &s;o homogenous, con&s;i&s;ting en|tirely of gelatinous points, which &s;eem to be kept together by a &s;till thinner jelly, that nothing &s;eems concealed from or ob&s;cured to the eye of the ob&s;erver. Now, when this animal is about to produce its young, a &s;welling or tumefaction takes place on a &s;ingle &s;pot of its body; and from this &s;welling there &s;hoots out fir&s;t the cylindrical body, and then the tentaculae of the young polypus. The&s;e are all of &s;o con|&s;iderable a &s;ize as to be ob&s;erved with the
<PB N="67" REF="75">naked eye: and when we con&s;ider this cir|cum&s;tance, and all the others already mention|ed, there does not appear the &s;malle&s;t probable ground for &s;uppo&s;ing, that an organized germ had pre-exi&s;ted there, and was now evolving.</P>
<P>I refer it to the internal feelings of every one who has attentively ob&s;erved this kind of production in animals, and plants of &s;o &s;imple a texture as tho&s;e alluded to, and who at the &s;ame time have well attended to all the arguments brought forward in the fore|going fection again&s;t the doctrine of the pre-exi&s;tence of the embryo of the chick in the yolk of the egg, whether in pa&s;&s;ing in his own mind to the generation of the more perfect or warm-blooded animals (as for in&s;tance by the mo&s;t accurate inve&s;tigation of the phenomena of the beginning, progre&s;s, and form of the embryo in the fecundated egg, and al&s;o of the many other parts<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Nidus pulli, bulla amnion, figura veno&s;a, &amp;c.</NOTE> which are never
<PB N="68" REF="76">to be found in the unfecunded one) whether, I &s;ay, his conviction leads him to believe in the pre-exi&s;tence of enveloped organic germs; or, in the exi&s;tence of a <HI>ni&s;us,</HI> by which a new being is formed from the unorganized mate|rials of generation.</P>
<P>All the arguments which have hitherto been deduced from the phenomena of genera|tion in &s;upport of the exi&s;tence of a <HI>Ni&s;us Formativus,</HI> gains new, and additional weight from the con&s;ideration of the phenomena of <HI>reproduction;</HI> this &s;o wonderful power of organi&s;ed bodies by which lo&s;t, and mutilated parts are again renewed.</P>
<P>Generation, and reproduction are both modifications of one, and the &s;ame power; the la&s;t being nothing el&s;e than a partial repetition of the fir&s;t. Whatever tends to elucidate the one, mu&s;t therefore throw light on the other.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="77">
<P>I have frequently repeated the experi|ments alluded to in the Fir&s;t Section, by which I endeavoured to di&s;cover the power of reproduction in the green armed polypus, and have con&s;tantly met with the &s;ame &s;uc|ce&s;s. The little mutilated animal was always dimini&s;hed in bulk, in proportion as its new arms or new body were pu&s;hed out. It be|came evident with what efforts nature ha&s;tened to renew the determinate form of the maimed animal, and al&s;o, that from the &s;hort period of time, and the improbability of the polypus having taken a &s;ufficient quantity of nouri&s;h|ment to &s;upply materials for the new mem|bers (&s;ince all wounded polypi eat le&s;s than u&s;ual); From the&s;e circum&s;tances I &s;ay, it became evident, that owing to the force of the <HI>Formative Ni&s;us</HI> with which the parts were endowed, the remaining portion of the mutilated animal, was in &s;ome degree, converted into the new members, and thus the di&s;turbed &s;tructure renewed.</P>
<PB N="70" REF="78">
<P>I am well aware, that the advocates for the theory of Evolution, will, in order to help them&s;elves out of this difficulty, have recou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e to an hypothe&s;is, which of all im|probable ones, may be &s;tiled the mo&s;t ro|mantic, and improbable; and according to which it is &s;uppo&s;ed, <Q>"That in every part of the polypus, there exi&s;ts innumerable germs enveloped, and torpid as it were, which lie like a hidden &s;tore, untill it &s;hall plea&s;e the fancy of a naturali&s;t to rou&s;e them into action, and free them from their &s;tate of impri&s;onment, by the enlivening cut of a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars."</Q></P>
<P>Now, let any one compare this expla|nation with the naked appearances which take place in the above, and many other experi|ments on the armed polypus, the proce&s;s of which are &s;o ea&s;y to be di&s;covered.&mdash;I &s;hall at pre&s;ent content my&s;elf with relating two of the&s;e experiments. When we take the half of two polypi of different kinds, for in&s;tance,
<PB N="71" REF="79">the anterior half of a green one, and the po&s;|terior half of a brown one, and bring them together at the bottom of a proper gla&s;s, they join together, and form in this manner, one of the&s;e mon&s;ters of mythology, repre&s;enting a group compo&s;ed of different parts of different animals.</P>
<P>According to the theory of Evolution, however, very different phenomena mu&s;t have occurred. In&s;tead of this junction between the two halves, each one ought to have evolved from an organic germ that part of which it had been deprived of; but this is not what we ob&s;erve; it was more natural that the two parts &s;hould join by the means of their formative powers, than that each of the halves &s;hould of it&s;elf have been metamor|pho&s;ed to a complete animal by the manner de&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>There is a well known experiment how|ever, which is admirably calculated to de|mon&s;trate both the improbability of the &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="72" REF="80">pre-exi&s;ting germs, and at the &s;ame time, the activity of the <HI>Formative Ni&s;us.</HI> When we take the polypus, and do not divide it in pieces, but merely &s;lit open its belly longitudinally, &s;o as to de&s;troy that cavity; and as it were, metamorpho&s;e the &s;hape of the animal from a cylindrical to a flat form; in&s;tead of a number of organic germs being &s;et free from the cut edges, and of their being each evolved, one of the two following oc|currences takes place; either the animal rolls it&s;elf together in the u&s;ual form, &s;o that the edges of the wound meet and coale&s;ce, or if it remains like a piece of flat tape, it begins &s;oon after to &s;well in the middle, as if it were blown up, and there is gradually formed within it a new belly.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e ca&s;es there is no occa&s;ion for new <HI>materials,</HI> all that is done is a mere <HI>reparation</HI> of the <HI>di&s;turbed &s;tructure.</HI></P>
<P>In man and other warm-blooded animals the power of reproduction is much more li|mited;
<PB N="73" REF="81">mited not only on account of the great diver&s;ity of materials of which they are compo&s;ed, but al&s;o the different quantity of living principle peculiar to each of the&s;e materials, and by the mutual de|pendance and action which they exerci&s;e on each other. And yet we often ob&s;erve in them evident marks of this power of reproduction, tending to confirm all that has been &s;aid on this head, concerning the polypus; nails have been ob&s;erved to grow on the &s;tump of a finger, even although the fir&s;t joint was completely lo&s;t<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Pecklin and Talp have &s;een in&s;tances of this kind.</NOTE> It would be rather a bold conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e that nature had fore&s;een &s;uch accidents, and had therefore &s;own all the fingers and toes with the organic germs of nails, &amp;c. And on the contrary, how agreeable to nature is it to deduce the whole phenomenon from the activity of the formative powers, who&s;e efforts are &s;ufficiently &s;trong to reproduce nails on the extremities of the fingers, nay even in un|u&s;ual parts.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="82">
<P>Another equally well known, and inter|e&s;ting fact of this kind, is, where nature en|deavours to &s;upply the lo&s;s of an extremity, who&s;e complicated &s;tructure it would have been difficult for her to re&s;tore, by the production of a more &s;imple and uniform &s;ub&s;tance. Thus, that celebrated &s;urgeon, Morand, gives the de&s;cription of a hare, which, a con&s;iderable time before its death, had had one of its fore legs &s;hot off, the place of which nature had endeavoured to &s;upply with a kind of bony &s;tump, which, although not like the original, <HI>quoad materiem,</HI> yet re&s;embled <HI>taliter qualiter quoad forman</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><Q>"C'etoit," to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion "une e&s;p&eacute;ce de jambe de bois, dont la nature &s;cule avoit faet le pais."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>If, as I flatter my&s;elf, the few phenome|na of generation, and reproduction already taken notice of, are &s;ufficient to prove the un|deniable
<PB N="75" REF="83">exi&s;tence of the <HI>Formative Ni&s;us,</HI> there remain many others tending to explain its <HI>modus operandi;</HI> and to a&s;certain &s;ome of the laws by which that mode &s;eems to be regulated. I look upon the following to be of this kind, that is, as the mere re&s;ult of undoubted ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The activity of the Ni&s;us, is, in an inver&s;e ratio, to the age of the organized body.</HI></P>
<P>For however certain it may be, as has been formerly remarked, that &s;ome time is nece&s;|&s;ary before the fir&s;t marks of the new conceived fruit becomes vi&s;ible, yet it is equally well a&s;certained, that after this interval, the forma|tion proceeds with a&s;toni&s;hing celerity.</P>
<P>In general, the embryos of the earlier months are repre&s;ented in a very un&s;hapely form, but this may be owing either to the per&s;on who gives the repre&s;entation; or to this, that &s;uch abortions generally &s;uffer much by external violence, are &s;queezed, compre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="76" REF="84">or from putrefaction having already begun, lo&s;e much of their uncommon elegance, which otherwi&s;e render them objects of admiration. I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of the&s;e beautiful human foetu&s;&s;es of the fir&s;t months of pregnancy, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which I received from my dear friend Mr. B&uuml;ckner of Gotha, where in one of five weeks old, and of the &s;ize of a common bee, all the features of the face, every &s;inger com|plete, every toe, and the organs of generation were to be di&s;tinctly &s;een.</P>
<P>Now this early activity of the Formative Ni&s;us, is by no means confined to the external form of the embryo, but is &s;till more remark|able in the internal &s;tructure. I have often been a&s;toni&s;hed at the early perfection of the vicera, which I have di&s;covered in di&s;&s;ecting recent human embryos of the fir&s;t months. Thus, merely to mention one circum&s;tance in its head, which was hardly larger than a pea, the whole cartilaginous <HI>ba&s;is cranii,</HI> with all its depre&s;&s;ions, apertures, and proce&s;&s;es, were marked in the mo&s;t &s;harp and di&s;tinct
<PB N="77" REF="85">manner, although, indeed, there was not the &s;malle&s;t point of o&s;&s;ification, either in the &s;phenoid bone, or the petrous part of the temporal one.</P>
<P>However difficult it may be on the &s;up|po&s;ition of pre-exi&s;ting germs, to explain what becomes of them for &s;o long a time after they arrive at the place of their de&s;tination, and are fecundated and &s;timulated to evolu|tion; it is equally difficult to imagine, why immediately after this interval, they &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly acquire &s;o re&s;pectable a &s;ize. On the contrary, after it has been fully under&s;tood, what was &s;aid concerning the time nece&s;&s;ary for the preparation of the fluids of generation, before the Formative Ni&s;us takes place; there remains nothing puzzling in this, that then the new awakened action &s;hould &s;o &s;oon form the ground work of the new animal.</P>
<P>That the inver&s;e ratio between the For|mative Ni&s;us, and the increa&s;e of age,
<PB N="78" REF="86">continues even after birth, is proved by the remarkable ea&s;e with which reproduction takes place in very young animals, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the lizard kind, as in the common newt.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Formative Ni&s;us is much more active in the embryos of mamelia, than in tho&s;e of oviparous animals.</HI></P>
<P>In the chick for in&s;tance, the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the ribs is ob&s;erved one hundred and twenty-nine hours after impregnation. This period is equal to the nineteenth week of ge&s;tation in, the human &s;pecies. But I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, human foetu&s;&s;es, which are not more than &s;ix weeks old, and yet in which, the cartilaginous rudiments of the ribs are to be di&s;tinctly di&s;covered. It would appear as if nature made greater ha&s;te with the formation of viviparous animals, to &s;ecure them again&s;t deformity, from acccidental cau&s;es, &s;uch as pre&s;&s;ure, external violence, &amp;c. from which cau&s;es all oviparous animals are defended by their &s;hell.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="87">
<P N="3">III. <HI>In the formation of &s;ome particular parts of any organized body, the Formative Ni&s;us is much more regular in its proce&s;s, than in that of others.</HI> Thus the brain, &s;ays old Conr. Vict. Schneider, a man much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in phy&s;iology, is &s;eldom or never found to deviate from the u&s;ual &s;tructure<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><Q>"In corpore humano," he &s;ays, "pars faciem &s;uam rarius mutal quam cerebrum."</Q></NOTE>. On the contrary, how great and frequent are the variations in many other parts, &s;uch as in the kidneys, and Thoracic Duct, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the many deviations of the formative proce&s;s from its u&s;ual cour&s;e, the&s;e are principally to be mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, <HI>Where one &s;pecies of organic body takes on the action of that of another.</HI></P>
<P>To this belong &s;ome of the mo&s;t unac|countable phenomena in nature, which, as
<PB N="80" REF="88">far as I am able to judge, cannot be explained in any &s;atisfactory manner by the theory of pre-exi&s;ting germs. It is a well-known fact, that women have in general, and ac|cording to the &s;trict laws of nature, only one uterus for the reception of the new con|ceived foetus. But that mo&s;t of the other fe|males in the cla&s;s of mamalia, have a double one. Yet in&s;tances are not wanting, where a real <HI>uterus bicornis</HI> has been found in women. This &s;ingularity, if I am not mi&s;taken, is accounted for by the previous reflection. In the &s;ame manner, I would reckon all tho&s;e hares, which have been &s;o frequently ob|&s;erved with &s;mall horns like tho&s;e of deers, and al&s;o many of tho&s;e &s;trange deviations, which take place now and then in the &s;truc|ture of the vegetable kingdom, &s;uch as the alder-tree with oak leaves, de&s;cribed by Gleditch<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Betula alnus quercifolia vid. Gleditch hinterla&s;&s;ene Abbandl. das practi&s;he Fortwe&s;en be|treffend.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="81" REF="89">
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>Where the organs of generation of one &s;ex take on more or le&s;s the &s;tructure of that of the other.</HI></P>
<P>In our &s;ceptical day, the po&s;&s;ibility of human hermaphrodites, and that of other warm-blooded animals, has been much doubt|ed. And yet Baron Haller of this univer&s;ity, and Mr. John Hunter of London, have in|&s;tituted, and given relations of the mo&s;t care|ful di&s;&s;ections of &s;uch animals, e&s;pecially in the cow, and goat tribes, and which leave no room for further doubts in this matter. It is true, that in none of the in&s;tances, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of generation, for in&s;tance, the male te&s;ticles, and female ovaria, were to be di&s;tinctly di&s;covered in the &s;ame individual. But though the chief form &s;eemed to be always that of one of the &s;exes, yet there was evidently to be di&s;covered in one part or another, the mo&s;t unequivocal, though imperfect marks of the organs of the other &s;ex. In general, the male organs lay internally, whil&s;t the external ones had more the re&s;emblance of the female.</P>
<PB N="82" REF="90">
<P N="3">3dly, <HI>When the formative proce&s;s does not, as in the former in&s;tances, take an action which is FOREIGN, but one that is completely PRETERNATURAL to the individual.</HI> And yet from an attentive con&s;ideration of the a&s;toni&s;hing uniformity, which reigns among&s;t the different kinds of mon&s;ters, it would appear as if the cau&s;es of the deviation in their formation, was regulated by certain fixed laws. Whoever has &s;een any con&s;ider|able number of mon&s;ters, or only looked into the loo&s;e and wretched compilations of re|pre&s;entations of them, can hardly have e&s;caped being &s;truck by the re&s;emblance which unites, even to the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable parts, cer|tain &s;pecies of them, &s;o that the individuals of that &s;pecies, &s;eem as if they had all been ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould.</P>
<P>To conclude, there is &s;till one other phenomenon, which the reader is at liberty to explain, either on the principle of pre-exi&s;ting
<PB N="83" REF="91">organic germs, or that of the Formative Ni&s;us. Many animal mon&s;ters, &s;uch for in|&s;tance, as tho&s;e with two bodies and a &s;ingle head, are of that kind, according to the ex|pre&s;s a&s;&s;ertion of Baron Haller, and other evolutioni&s;ts, that they cannot have ari&s;en from the accidental growth of two germs, but that the fault lies in the original mon&s;tro&s;ity of a &s;ingle germ. Now it is &s;ingular, that &s;uch mon&s;ters are only common in animal, which have been dome&s;ticated, and that they are never, or at lea&s;t &s;eldom to be heard of in their wild &s;tate. Can the Author of nature have ordained it, that from among&s;t the in|volved germs of any one &s;pecies of animals, for in&s;tance, &s;wine, the mon&s;ters &s;hould ar|rive at evolution, ju&s;t when taken under the care of men, and that the mon&s;ters &s;hould be produced only by the tame, and not by the wild al&s;o?</P>
<P>On the other hand, there is nothing un|rea&s;onable in &s;uppo&s;ing, that after the &s;ub|jection of the&s;e animals, their whole frame
<PB N="84" REF="92">and oeconomy &s;uffer a very great change; that then the Formative Ni&s;us deviates in &s;ome degree from its original laws, and there|fore the&s;e animals as they degenerate into endle&s;s varieties, are al&s;o more &s;ubjected to mon&s;tro&s;ity.</P>
<P>Such, in my opinion, are the principal ob&s;ervations and experiments which &s;erve to prove the exi&s;tence of the Formative Ni&s;us, and to a&s;certain &s;ome of its laws; ob&s;ervations which have drawn my conviction more and more from the &s;y&s;tem of involved germs, and confirmed my belief in the very oppo&s;ite doc|trine, which I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
