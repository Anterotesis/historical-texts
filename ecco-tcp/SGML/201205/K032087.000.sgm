<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following collection of Ca&s;es is the practical part of a con&s;iderable work written on glandular affections in general; in which their cau&s;es will be explained, and a new theory drawn from the late&s;t anatomical di&s;coveries in the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem. As numbers are daily &s;uffering under the&s;e ra|vaging complaints; humanity dictated to me the nece&s;&s;ity of the pre&s;ent publication, and it is hoped this attempt to alleviate human mi&s;ery, will be received with candor.</P>
<P>THE names of the generality of patients have not been introduced; but &s;everal of di&s;|tinction may be referred to, &s;hould it be e&s;|teemed nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
<P>IT would be highly unbecoming the dig|nity of the profe&s;&s;ion, not to have a tender con|cern for the reputation of others: the candid, therefore, will perfectly conceive my motive for concealing the practitioners, who, un|&s;ucce&s;sfully, attended the &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;es, previous to my being con&s;ulted.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE uncertainty of curing ulcerated legs by re&s;t, &s;alivation, &amp;c. and the frequent re|lap&s;es of patients di&s;charged from ho&s;pitals, induced me, near twenty years ago, to &s;earch for remedies more adequate to the nature of the com|plaint. The cau&s;e of ulcers I conceived to be owing to &s;ome &s;corbutic or other taint in the habit; in which the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem was principally af|fected; an internal alterative treatment was a|dopted, &s;ucce&s;s in many in&s;tances was the con&s;e|quence, and the improvements were made public in the year 1767<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Treati&s;e on the method of curing ulcerated legs without re&s;t, proved by a variety of Ca&s;es.</NOTE> The doctrines<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Sharp's Surgery.</NOTE> that <Q>old ulcers were difficult of cure; that it would be dangerous to attempt the healing them, as it might endanger the patient's life, or produce a diarrhoea, fever, or a&s;thma,</Q> were refuted by undeniable facts.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of the ulcer is commonly in the adipo&s;e membrane, which is &s;ometimes thickened and very frequently callous. I di&s;covered in the cure, that the&s;e hardened parts became &s;oft and pliant; and from hence &s;ome hopes were entertained that a &s;i|milar practice might remove glandular complaints. A trial proved the conjecture not ill founded; for a con&s;iderable number of indurated brea&s;ts, which an exten&s;ive employment in midwifery fur|ni&s;hed, were in general cured by gentle alteratives. Numbers of patients in di&s;orders of this nature pre|&s;ented them&s;elves, as advice and remedies were given for many years without any gratuity. Afterwards an ho&s;pital was opened, to which the poor might daily
<PB N="2" REF="5">apply, with no other recommendations than di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ickne&s;s. There were &s;eldom le&s;s than four or five hundred patients under cure in di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes, &s;chrophulous, cancerous, ulcerous and other indi&s;po&s;itions The experience obtained from this great variety of ca&s;es, enabled me to comprehend a more beneficial treatment than the common, which was acknowledged defective, by that excel|lent &s;urgeon, the late Mr. Samuel Sharp. Im|provements were gradually made from a more mi|nute knowledge of the complaints, and &s;ome dread|ful affections formerly thought incurable, were conquered by the gentle&s;t means. The di&s;orders in|cident to the brea&s;ts, after delivery, could in ge|neral be prevented chiefly by a partial ab&s;tinence from liquids; or, if tumors or inflammation hap|pened, remedies more efficacious than &s;haking the brea&s;ts, embrocations of oil, brandy, and vinegar, plai&s;ters of diachilon, or treacle on brown paper, &amp;c. could be admini&s;tered with a certainty of advantage in every ca&s;e. A treati&s;e has been written on the&s;e &s;ubjects, and the curative intenti|ons fully explained.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A treati&s;e on the di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;ts, and methods of managing women during childbed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> The confidence of &s;everal per&s;ons of rank, the public protection, and the plea&s;ure which reiterated &s;ucce&s;s produced, ex|cited fre&s;h ardor in the pur&s;uit of new enquiries.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual methods of managing di&s;tempers of the eyes &s;eemed to be exceedingly defective, and in many in&s;tances cruel. The&s;e &s;ubjects next en|gaged my attention; the ancient and modern treatment was examined, and in a publication cen&s;ured, or prai&s;ed, in proportion as it experi|mentally appeared to have had merits or de|fects<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Treati&s;e on the ancient and modern methods of curing di&s;ea&s;es of the Eyes, with new improvements.</NOTE>. External applications to the eyes, par|ticularly
<PB N="3" REF="6">poultices, were in general condemned, with the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned; the inflammatory in|di&s;po&s;itions were reduced under four heads;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Ives makes a number of u&s;ele&s;s di&s;tinctions.</NOTE> new methods of cure were recommended, and il|lu&s;trated by proofs of per&s;ons relieved. The manner of extracting the cataract was &s;ucce&s;sfully improved, and many patients were re&s;tored to &s;ight.</P>
<P>To demon&s;trate that it is on facts alone that the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are made, the following collection of ca&s;es now make their appearance as an addition to the former<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Upwards of &s;ixty ca&s;es have already been publi&s;hed in the treati&s;es.</NOTE>; in order to extend and confirm the utility of the improvements, and render them more beneficially u&s;eful to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The principal remedies u&s;ed in the cures were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Cinnabar antimonii.</ITEM>

<ITEM>Aethiops mineralis.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sulphur antominii precipitatum.</ITEM>

<ITEM>The Caput mortuum, of &s;pirits of nitre.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Calx antimonii.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Unguentum &s;aturninum.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="7">The Aethiops mineralis &s;hould be prepared by rubbing a con&s;iderable time without any heat.</P>
<P>The aquila alba is the calomel ten or twelve times &s;ublimed, by which its purgative and dra&s;tic qualities are de&s;troyed; a quarter, or half a grain joined with an equal quantity of &s;ulphur antimonii precipitatum, when well rubbed for a long time together, and formed into a pill, with confectio damocrat. is called Pilula rubra.</P>
<P>The nitre &s;hould be rendered perfectly pure, by fu&s;ing in a crucible, and rechri&s;talli&s;ation. When mixed with equal parts of aethiops min. and a &s;mall portion of cinnabar antimon. by a long tritura|tion; the compo&s;ition is called Pulvis mineralis.</P>
<P>Camphorated julap has been often pre&s;cribed, with the other remedies, as a re&s;olvent and cor|rector.</P>
<P>The aquila alba, is given in the do&s;e of a quar|ter or half a grain, formed into a pill, with &s;ugar, and a mucilage of gum arabic; this is named pilula alba.</P>
<P>The calx antimonii, and the aethiops antimo|nialis, are given in general to per&s;ons who have a dry &s;kin.</P>
<P>The &s;piritus &s;alis ammoniaci is &s;ometimes added to the &s;olutions of &s;imple nitre, and is called mi&s;tu|ra nitro&s;a volatilis. The aether nitri is given to patients exceedingly nervous, or who have hectical &s;ymptoms; it acts by allaying irritation, without producing the ill qualities of opiates, and is pre|pared from one part of pure &s;trong &s;pirit of nitre, and two of alcohol, without heat, in a long necked cucurbit, with a head, tubes and receivers proper for conveying the white fumes; and is called E&s;|&s;entia volatilis,</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>The caput mortuum of &s;pirits of nitre, is what remains after the di&s;tillation, according to the me|thod of Glauber, and is called Sal neutralis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The difference is very con&s;iderable between this &s;alt and that prepared in the common manner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s in the cures will greatly depend on the purity of the remedies. An unadulterated nitre is rarely to be obtained; as what is &s;old, com|monly contains a portion of &s;ea &s;alt, and is united &s;ometimes with a wor&s;e ingredient.</P>
<P>Crude antimony is often impure. The argentum vivum, even when it pa&s;&s;es through leather, is fre|quently adulterated with poi&s;onous ingredients; therefore that u&s;ed in the following ca&s;es, has al|ways been revived from cinnabar. The aqulla alba at pre&s;ent is not commonly prepared; the calomel, however, which it is hoped will not be &s;ub&s;tituted for it, will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;es intended.</P>
<P>The &s;al neutralis is &s;eldom to be had genuine. The medicine in the &s;hops neare&s;t to it is the &s;al po|polychre&s;tum. The goodne&s;s of the calx antimonii, and the aethiops antimonialis, will greatly depend on the purity of the articles which compo&s;e them. The factitious and the antimonial cinnabar is fre|quently adulterated with red lead, and if taken in|wardly, or received as a fumigation, mu&s;t do in|finite mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Every one accu&s;tomed to the &s;tudy and practice of chemi&s;try, will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;i&s;ting on exactne&s;s to be ob&s;erved in the preparations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A number of experiments on the&s;e preparations, with the manner of detection if they &s;hould be &s;ophi&s;ticated, may be the &s;ubject of a future e&s;&s;ay.</NOTE>, which when properly admini&s;tered, produce little, or no &s;en&s;ible operation. At fir&s;t &s;mall do&s;es &s;hould be pre&s;cribed, which may be gradually increa&s;ed, as the con&s;titution becomes more habituated to them.</P>

The patient was of a remarkable delicate con&s;titution, exceedingly nervous and irrita|ble, and had undergone repeated bleedings, by the advice of an eminent city &s;urgeon, without any be|nefit. She took the pilula rubra three times a day, and a &s;olution of nitre, and in about &s;ix weeks all the &s;wellings were re&s;olved, and the veins of the brea&s;ts reduced to their natural &s;ize. This patient, con|trary to my advice, neglected taking her remedies, and was attacked with a di&s;order in the womb, and afterwards the brea&s;t became painful, the veins &s;welled again; but on returning to the medicines, a cure hath been obtained.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="11">for &s;ix years, and for above two years before &s;he applied, had been in con&s;tant and violent pains. There were four foul livid ulcers, which di&s;charged a very offen&s;ive acrimonious humour; the veins of the brea&s;t were enlarged, and &s;he was in &s;uch tortures, as to be deprived of re&s;t night and day. An eminent ho&s;pital &s;urgeon had advi&s;ed her to have her brea&s;t cut off; and declared it to be impo&s;&s;ible to cure her. She took the pilula rubra ter de die, and &s;o|lutio nitri. The hardened parts gradually re&s;olved; the brea&s;t which was before fixed became movea|ble, the ulcers healed, and the cure was accom|pli&s;hed in between two and three months. This per&s;on has remained ever &s;ince in good health, and has not had the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of a complaint in the brea&s;t, though it is between &s;ix and &s;even years.</P>

<P>A Very re&s;pectable Baronet recommended Mrs. E&mdash;, of Hertford&s;hire, for advice in a large hard &s;welling in the whole brea&s;t, which was greatly di&s;tended, immoveable, and as hard as a &s;tone; be&s;ides this, there were five large ul|cers di&s;charging an exceedingly offen&s;ive matter, excre&s;cences were likewi&s;e forming and &s;loughing away continually.

Neither ea&s;e nor re&s;t could be ob|tained even by the u&s;e of opiates. The arm on the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ide was with difficulty moved, e&s;pe|cially in elevating it towards the head.

<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>MRS.

About two years ago an ulcer was formed, &s;urrounding the nipple; which di&s;charged a great quantity of acrimonious &s;erum; the hardne&s;s much increa&s;ed in &s;ize, was very painful, and it was with difficulty her right arm could be lifted to|wards the head. By bleeding occa&s;ionally, the u&s;e of the pulvis mineralis and pilula rubra, the &s;welling has been con&s;iderably reduced, the u&s;e of the arm recovered; the ulcer has not become lar|ger; and though the perfect cure of this ca&s;e can|not be expected; yet life may be rendered tolera|bly comfortable for a number of years, in a di&s;or|der that rough methods might have put a period to.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely believe, that if the&s;e remedies of the al|terative kind were always u&s;ed on the fir&s;t ap|pearance of any hardne&s;s, or &s;welling in the brea&s;ts or womb, that either their increa&s;e would be pre|vented, or a perfect cure would commonly be effected. Complaints in the brea&s;t are evident; but tho&s;e of the womb are often mi&s;under&s;tood by phy&s;icians, and treated very improperly, owing to a want of practical &s;kill in midwifery. The bark and acids frequently do irreparable mi&s;chief, if given in the &s;chirrus or ulcer, as likewi&s;e the u&s;e of hemlock, opiates, &s;alt water, baths, injec|tions, &amp;c. &amp;c. Many melancholy in&s;tances of this nature have happened, which, were they publi&s;h|ed, would &s;trike minds, &s;u&s;ceptible of feeling, with horror.</P>

<P>I was recommended by Her Grace the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;, to Mrs. P&mdash;, who had a cancerous complaint in her brea&s;t. She had been for near two years under the care of a &s;urgeon, who a&s;|&s;erted, with confidence, that &s;he would certainly be cured. He applied cau&s;tics to &s;ome hardened tumors under the arm, as likewi&s;e to the brea&s;t; and it was reported, that he had given &s;ome pre|parations of ar&s;enic; this la&s;t circum&s;tance, however, can &s;carce be credited, we &s;hould hope it not true.

<HEAD>CASE XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. M&mdash;, in the year 1767, perceived a drawing in of the nipple, without any hardne&s;s of the right brea&s;t. An eminent &s;urgeon in town advi&s;ed an i&s;&s;ue; afterwards was pre&s;cribed the aethiop. vegetabil. and mercurial pills. The di&s;order, after this, did not increa&s;e till towards the year 1771, hemlock was then ordered by a very learned phy&s;ician. The brea&s;t &s;welled and was hard; under the arm were likewi&s;e tumors. In May 1772 a cau&s;tic was applied, under the &s;pecious name of a plai&s;ter, to draw the cancer out. The cau&s;tic was continued weekly, and a poultice u&s;ed, till the whole &s;chirrus was &s;phacelated and removed, which happened July the 6th. It was afterwards dre&s;&s;ed with Turner's cerate, healed, and continued well for two years, though little indurations, about the &s;ize of pea&s;e, appeared on the remaining part of the brea&s;t. From the latter end of 1774, until the &s;pring of 1775, the pa|tient had con&s;iderable pains. The part where the cau&s;tic had been fixed, broke out again; the &s;wel|ling in the axilla was enlarged, and pre&s;&s;ing on the great ve&s;&s;els, occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable &s;welling in the arm. The &s;urgeon, mentioned in the la&s;t ca&s;e, was con&s;ulted, who promi&s;ed confidently a cure, and boldly applied cau&s;tics to the tumors in the axilla; this produced a large ulcer, brought on great pain in the parts, accompanied with a cough. Afterwards, by his utmo&s;t efforts, the &s;ore could
<PB N="17" REF="20">not be healed. On June the 12th I fir&s;t in&s;pected the di&s;ea&s;ed parts, and acquainted a relation of the patient's, that little &s;ucce&s;s could be expected, as violent methods had been u&s;ed. An attempt, however, was made, the pilula rubra and the pul|vis mineralis, with the calx antimonii, and a pec|toral mixture, were given with great &s;ucce&s;s; for in about three months the ulcers, both in the axilla and brea&s;t, were nearly healed; and the lady went into the country happy beyond expre&s;&s;ion. In le&s;t than a twelvemonth, however, the ulcers broke out again, and the patient langui&s;hed for two or three months and died. Perhaps if no remedies whatever had been u&s;ed, the advice of the fir&s;t &s;urgeon con&s;ulted, attended to, this lady might probably have been living now.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XIX.</HEAD>
<P>LADY <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">, had for one year and a half a tumor in the left brea&s;t, which was not very pain|ful, but a great part was indurated. This lady was advi&s;ed to apply to a gentleman, who endea|vours to per&s;uade the world, that he can &s;afely ex|tract cancerous tumors with a plai&s;ter. Though in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e there was no &s;ore, nor any pre&s;|&s;ing &s;ymptoms, the operator ra&s;hly applied his cau&s;tics, with the mo&s;t confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">nt promises of &s;ucce&s;s, and repeated them for four or five months, the patient &s;uffering the whole time the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing tortures. The malady increa&s;ed; which is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e where violent methods are adopted; a large cancerous ulcer, &s;urrounded with con&s;iderable &s;pongy excre&s;cences, appeared, which, from time to time, were de&s;troyed by the cau&s;tics, but returned &s;oon again. The di&s;ea&s;e extended it|&s;elf to the other brea&s;t. Hemlock, opiates, pow|dered corns of a hor&s;e, carrot poultices, had been
<PB N="18" REF="21">admini&s;tered without &s;ucce&s;s. Upon my being con&s;ulted, an opinion was delivered, that the cure could not, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, be expected, and mitigating the &s;ymptoms would be doubtful. This judgment was pronounced from experience in a multiplicity of ca&s;es, where &s;uch barbarous treatment had precluded every hope of relief. The patient, however, wi&s;hed for &s;ome trial to be made; the pilula rubra, and the pul|vis mineralis, were given, and the inflammation, which had chiefly ari&s;en from the cau&s;tic &s;alts, &s;ub&s;ided, the progre&s;s of the di&s;order was pre|vented from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters">ing its dreadful ravages on the other brea&s;t; but no other advantage was obtained, except that the pain was in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated. Sloughs &s;ucceeded &s;loughs, and occa&s;ioned a mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;tench; the acrid di&s;charge was con&s;ider|able; the patient became hectical; opiates could not produce relief, and thus lingering under the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and accumulated mi&s;eries, &s;hock|ing indeed to the &s;pectators, but inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;o to the worthy lady who langui&s;hed under them; &s;he died about two months after.</P>
<P>From experience it may be a&s;&s;erted, from the circum&s;tances of the foregoing ca&s;e, the lady might have lived years, and even though &s;he might not have been cured; by bleeding, the alterative reme|dies occasionally, a proper diet, and mild applica|tions to the part, the complaint might have occa&s;ion|ed little trouble, and perhaps not increa&s;ed. Many, too many &s;imilar examples have occurred, of life being &s;hortened, and the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible mi|&s;eries created, by the cruel application of cau&s;tics, as well as an unfeeling u&s;e of the knife. There are many in&s;tances of cancers, in which it would be fruitle&s;s to attempt the cure; the phy&s;ician is

<P>A MAIDEN lady aged 47, about eight years ago, applied for advice in an induration of the right brea&s;t; the nipple was inverted, and di&s;|charged an acrimonious &s;erum, attended with con|&s;iderable pain; there were likewi&s;e glandular &s;wel|lings in the axilla. The hardne&s;s was of &s;uch a nature, that there were not the lea&s;t hopes of re|&s;olving it; the amputation of the brea&s;t had been recommended by a &s;urgeon, which, had it been performed, would have been exceedingly cruel, and probably fatal, as no pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s could have been entertained, owing to the axillary af|fection. The pulvis mineralis alone was ordered ter de die; and was continued for &s;ix weeks at a time, &s;pring and autumn; a regular diet was ob|&s;erved, wine, acids, and &s;alt meats were ab&s;tained from, a quarter of a pint of warm water was ta|ken every day before meat.

<P>MRS. P&mdash;, aged 42, had been mother of &s;ix children. After the delivery of the two la&s;t &s;he had each time a fever from cold, which occa&s;ioned a great hardne&s;s of the left brea&s;t, that continued nearly in one &s;tate for nine years. In the year 1771, the brea&s;t was painful, and rather increated in &s;ize for above three months. This alteration &s;ucceeded a violent inflammatory fever. From this time, until Jan. 1773, there were &s;hooting pains: when, the men&s;es cea&s;|ing to appear, &s;ome eruptions, di&s;charging a &s;harp watry humor, were di&s;covered; the advice of an eminent phy&s;ician was taken; &s;alts and manna tinctura &s;enae and hemlock pills were ordered, and per&s;i&s;ted in for &s;even months: but the di&s;ea&s;e grew con&s;iderably wor&s;e. In the latter end of July and all Augu&s;t, the &s;alt water was drank; which greatly relaxed the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and an&s;wered no good purpo&s;e. On October 3, 1773, &s;he applied to me for relief; the brea&s;t was then as large as a child's head two years old, exce&s;&s;ive hard, inflamed, uneven in its &s;urface, extending to the axilla, where likewise were &s;ome indurations, and the arm on that &s;ide was con&s;iderably &s;welled. On the lower part of the brea&s;t was a cancerous ulcer, &s;ome part of which was &s;oft and fungous; there were many fi&s;&s;ures, from which i&s;&s;ued a very acrid di&s;charge. The pains were &s;o acute and di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing, that no re&s;t could be obtained; a continual crying was heard, like to a per&s;on in labour. Bleeding was fir&s;t pre&s;cribed; the pilula rubra, the pulvis mineralis, and the &s;olution of camphor, with the e&s;&s;entia volatilis, were admini&s;tered.

<HEAD>CASE XXII.</HEAD>
<P>A lady of rank, between 70 and 80, had a large hardne&s;s of the cancerous kind in the left brea&s;t; a great part of the induration was extremely hard, and on the lower part was a very livid ap|pearance with little fi&s;&s;ures. The whole brea&s;t was di&s;ea&s;ed, inflamed and extended, &s;o as to affect the edge of the right brea&s;t, and there was a large tumour towards the axilla; the pains had become exceedingly trouble&s;ome, the &s;wellings had increa&s;ed rapidly, and were very alarming. This was a ca&s;e in which no cure could be expected; an alleviation of the mi&s;ery alone could be attempted. The opinion I gave to &s;everal ladies of quality, friends to the afflicted patient, and the noble Lord her &s;ons was, that a cure was impo&s;&s;ible; but that &s;ome hopes were entertained, that the inflammation, &s;wellings and pains, in a great mea&s;ure, could be removed. The pilula rubra was admini&s;tered, with the pulvis mineralis ter de die. In about three weeks the inflammation entirely &s;ub&s;ided, and all the &s;welling, except that very hardened part, in a great degree re&s;olved, the brea&s;t was relaxed, and the pains nearly abated. The pill was then inrea&s;ed in its do&s;e, and the powder. This
<PB N="22" REF="25">cour&s;e was continued for between two and three months, and the patient was very ea&s;y. The livid part at this time, as had been progno&s;ticated, broke and formed an ulcer; this was &s;ucceeded by a &s;pha|celus of the &s;tony induration, which was thrown off gradually, and with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance gently re|moved. The di&s;charge was now exceedingly of|fen&s;ive, from the putridity of the parts &s;loughing away; the carrot poultice was applied, but an&s;wered no good purpo&s;e whatever. In this manner the whole of the di&s;ea&s;ed part came away, and there was an ulcer, in which me hand might be buried. The remedies were continued, the ulcer became clean and not offen&s;ive, and little or no pain was experienced. The di&s;charge from this large ulcer was very con&s;iderable, which would have been much larger, had not the medicines fortunately re&s;olved a very con&s;iderable part of the tumor: the patient gradually became weaker, and the medicines were then di&s;continued Oedematous &s;wellings of the legs afterwards made their ap|pearance, probably owing to the univer&s;al relaxa|tion of the habit, and with very little or no pain the patient langui&s;hed for &s;ame time, and died.</P>

<P>The&s;e complaints gradually increa&s;ed for two or three years, and the lady finding no relief from any remedy which was pre&s;cribed by the medical gentlemen of the county in which &s;he re&s;ided, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult another phy&s;i|cian.

<P>We now find that the hemlock, that fa&s;hiona|ble and de&s;tructive drug is admini&s;tered, but with|out the lea&s;t advantage. It however enables us to draw this conclu&s;ion, that the ca&s;e was treated as a cancer. Soon after the lady had taken the hem|lock, a giddine&s;s of the head was complained of, and a lo&s;s of memory was the con&s;equence, which continued a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t pre&s;criptions were per&s;i&s;ted in till the 7^t^h of December, during which time the &s;ymp|toms became more violent; the lady continued in extreme mi&s;ery, and her memory became &s;o much impaired, that &s;he could &s;carce recollect any tran&s;|action one minute pa&s;t. This la&s;t complaint I mu&s;t attribute to the hemlock; becau&s;e I have known &s;everal in&s;tances where this noxious drug has produced &s;imilar effects; and one in particu|lar, where it brought on comato&s;e &s;ymptoms, and inconte&s;tibly proved fatal.

<P>The foregoing pre&s;criptions were certainly in|adequate to the cure of &s;uch an ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;e: but, as it is the common mode of practice, a de|viation from it perhaps would have been con&s;ider|ed erroneous, as being contrary to the rules of art. E&s;tabli&s;hed maxims, however un&s;ucce&s;sful, are &s;eldom relinqui&s;hed, though the pre&s;ervation of life is frequently dependant on it.</P>
<P>The lady had a &s;chirrus of the uterus, which produced an inexpre&s;&s;ible and con&s;tant pain. There was a continual &s;anious di&s;charge of that complex|ion and fetor, which characteri&s;e a cancerous ul|cer; the patient was under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;|&s;ity of lying in bed, for the evacuation of the urine and feces, and both were attended with great pain, and a con&s;iderable quantity of puru|lent matter, con&s;equently there was an ulcer in the rectum. The&s;e &s;ymptoms, after the admini&s;tration of the opiates and cretaceous medicines, were ac|companied
<PB N="34" REF="37">with co&s;tivene&s;s, the mo&s;t excruciating pains, cold &s;hiverings, nau&s;ea, and &s;ometimes vo|mitings, lo&s;s of memory, and a countenance, which &s;eemed to foretel a total di&s;&s;olution. So emaciated and exhau&s;ted was the patient, that na|ture &s;eemed too weak to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of any medicine. A great part of the &s;urface of the body was covered with &s;corbutic eruptions; and the lea&s;t motion, even from the bed to a &s;opha, occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations. At this time Lord le De&s;pen&s;er did me the honour to re|commend me, in con&s;equence of my &s;ucce&s;s, in a ca&s;e which his Lord&s;hip was acquainted with. At the reque&s;t of the brother, Captain S. I vi&s;ited the Lady on the 15th of December, 1772. I exa|mined minutely every circum&s;tance, and endea|voured to gain a clear information of what had been already attempted by the gentlemen who had been con&s;ulted, and committed the whole immediately to paper, which was ju&s;t as I have related it.</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration of this complicated ca&s;e, di&s;|po&s;ed me, however, to believe, there yet remained &s;ome hopes of effecting a cure. I re&s;olved, there|fore, to admini&s;ter &s;ome remedies, which expe|rience gave me rea&s;on to think were more adequate to the cure of &s;uch inveterate complaints, than tho&s;e which had been already pre&s;cribed. I began with the pilula rubra and pulvis mineralis, in very &s;mall do&s;es, and forbad the u&s;e of opiates, as their bad effects in weakening, greatly overbalance the little temporary relief they give.</P>
<P>The&s;e remedies produced &s;uch excellent effects, that the co&s;tivene&s;s was removed, and all the &s;ymp|toms were alleviated in a fortnight. The patient was then removed into the country, and recovered daily. In about one month &s;he could &s;it up three
<PB N="35" REF="38">or four hours, though in the mo&s;t inclement part of the winter. In about four months more by continu|ing the remedies, the Lady recovered her memory perfectly, and every di&s;charge had a more favour|able appearance. The eruptions entirely di&s;ap|peared. She recovered her appetite and natural re&s;t, which for &s;ome years before &s;he had been de|prived of. By a per&s;everance in the &s;ame medicines, and by gradually increa&s;ing their do&s;es, a perfect cure was at la&s;t accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Lady continues in perfect health, and rides on hor&s;eback, without the lea&s;t inconvenience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In complaints of the brea&s;t and womb all rough a&s;trin|gents are commonly injurious, e&s;pecially if they be of the &s;chirrus kind.

<P>A lady of fa&s;hion, naturally of a delicate con|&s;titution, above 40, who formerly had &s;everal hard labors, and particularly with her la&s;t child in 1761, had been &s;uffering for near fourteen years with a complaint in the rectum. In the early months of pregnancy the piles were continually trouble&s;ome, and for fourteen years after the la&s;t delivery, on every evacuation of the feces, was a quantity of blood di&s;charged. When the di&s;order was fir&s;t dis|covered, a very eminent &s;urgeon and a man-mid|wife injudiciou&s;ly advi&s;ed turpentine gli&s;ters to be injected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certainly no practitioner who under&s;tood the anatomical &s;tructure of the inte&s;tines, or who reflected on their irritabi|lity, would have advi&s;ed &s;uch a violent heating remedy to &s;uch nervous parts, already in a &s;tate of inflammation.</NOTE>; which greatly irritated the inflamed part, and after this, a purulent matter as well as blood was di&s;charged, which proved exceedingly relaxing. The practitioners con&s;ulted, finding the rectum ul|cerated, and after exerting their utmo&s;t efforts to remove the complaint, per&s;uaded the patient, as is too common, that the di&s;charge was healthful, and carried off other bodily di&s;orders. Upon ex|amination afterwards, it was declared, by a very eminent &s;urgeon, that there was a large fungus in the inte&s;tine, but that no operation could prove u&s;eful. Depending on the opinions given, and the reputation of the practitioners con&s;ulted, the mi&s;ery was bore with the greate&s;t fortitude, there not appearing the lea&s;t hopes of relief. Having &s;een the &s;ucce&s;sful treatment of M. S. mentioned Ca&s;e XXVI, this lady was induced to apply to me, Sept. 8, 1774. The countenance was very pale, the whole body was exceedingly relaxed, with a great languor of &s;pirits, and a hectical look;
<PB N="39" REF="42">twice in a day was di&s;charged a cupful of blood and fetid matter. The opinion I gave to the friends, was, that the rectum was ulcerated, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to determine whether relief could be obtained; upon the whole, that any &s;uc|ce&s;s was doubtful. A trial was made. Ten grains of the pulvis mineralis were at fir&s;t given, which agreed perfectly well, and every week the do&s;e was increa&s;ed, until twenty-five grains were taken four times a day, for &s;ix weeks. Nouri&s;hing diet, rather of the animal gelatinous kind was recom|mended. In about two months the di&s;charge had con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed; the patient continued the powders, with one grain of the calx antimonii, and had the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of finding the ulcer healed, both di&s;charges had cea&s;ed in nine months. This lady has remained perfectly well ever &s;ince, which is now above four years; but has taken occa&s;ionally the &s;al neutralis and the pulvis mineralis &s;ince the cure, by her own de&s;ire.</P>

<P>MRS. C. had, for above one year and a half, &s;uffered extreme mi&s;ery, from a &s;chirrus and ulcer of the uterus. The fir&s;t practitioners in London had been con&s;ulted, and after trying various reme|dies, as opiates, laxatives, hemlock, &amp;c. gave up the ca&s;e as lo&s;t. The pains were acute, and de|prived the patient of re&s;t; the &s;chirrus was large, pre&s;&s;ing both on the rectum and neck of the blad|der, occa&s;ioning a difficulty in the expul&s;ion of urine and the feces; a fetid, purulent and acri|monious matter was di&s;charged in great quanti|ties, very offen&s;ive, and evidently of the cancer|ous kind. Sometimes the pains were equal to the &s;tronge&s;t labor pains; the whole body was greatly
<PB N="40" REF="43">emaciated, and the patient had not been able to &s;it up for many months. The pilula rubra and the pulvis mineralis, with one grain of the calx. antimonia, were given three times in the day, and the u&s;e of opiates entirely left off. In the cour&s;e of &s;ix weeks, during which time the &s;ymptoms daily decrea&s;ed, the patient could &s;it up; the re|medies were continued for about three months more, and all the complaints were nearly remov|ed. About this time I went abroad, was gone for near three months, and on my return found that no one complaint remained, except &s;ome lit|tle di&s;charge and weakne&s;s. The medicines were &s;till continued, with the julep. e camphor. and there was every rea&s;on to conclude the patient nearly cured. Some time after, however, came on a violent diarrhoea, which proved fatal.</P>
<P>When an ulcer accompanies a &s;welling and hardne&s;s of the womb, the pro&s;pects of cure are doubtful; in many &s;uch in&s;tances the reme|dies, however, have afforded a very com|fortable relief for years, and kept the patients from tho&s;e intolerable pains, which mu&s;t &s;trike every humane &s;pectator with horror, when the common modes of treatment are alone pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;onable to conclude, that, what gives &s;uch extraordinary relief in de&s;perate ca&s;es, and which in &s;ome in&s;tances has proved a po&s;itive cure, would in general prevent the&s;e complaints at a certain time of life; or when the di&s;orders fir&s;t make their appearance.</P>
<P>Practitioners in general, and all authors, either an|cient or modern, have con&s;idered the&s;e uterine com|plaints incurable; upon this principle, when the di&s;order is di&s;covered, they often per&s;uade the &s;uffering patient, that nothing more than the ad|mini&s;tration of palliatives can be done. I have
<PB N="41" REF="44">often been called in, after much mi&s;chief has been done by improper practices; where there remain|ed not the lea&s;t probability of affording relief; nay, &s;ometimes but a few hours before death, and then it has been with exultation reported, but with what degree of candor or humanity let the world judge, that the patient has died under my care.</P>

<P>H. F&mdash;, E&s;q; a married gentleman, had an ob|&s;truction in the urethra, ari&s;ing from excre&s;cences, and a &s;chirrus of the pro&s;trate gland. Bougies had been u&s;ed a con&s;iderable time without remov|ing the complaint. The patient was frequently under the nece&s;&s;ity of having the urine drawn off by means of a catheter; the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain accompanied the di&s;charge of urine, which i&s;&s;ued in drops, and from the contracting and expul&s;ive efforts of the bladder, joined with the re&s;i&s;tance near its neck, the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery was experienced; and this happened very often; for there &s;eemed, almo&s;t, a con&s;tant irritation of the parts. All diuretics and emollients had exa&s;pera|ted the &s;ymptoms; by promoting the &s;ecretion of urine in a di&s;order which re&s;i&s;ted powerfully its evacuation. A co&s;tivene&s;s prevailed, and mo&s;t cathartics irritated. Solid meat was &s;ure to cau&s;e pain; a milk diet had been per&s;i&s;ted in by the advice of a phy&s;ician, and the &s;olvent medicines had been admini&s;tered under the care of a reputa|ble &s;urgeon, but without &s;ucce&s;s. On pa&s;&s;ing a &s;mall bougie, I perceived a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance, as nigh as could be conjectured, within half an inch of the pro&s;trate grand; on pu&s;hing on the bougie, another powerful re&s;i&s;tance was felt near the la&s;t mentioned part.

The effects were beyond expectation; for in three weeks after the urine was di&s;charged with ea&s;e, &s;mall &s;loughs pa&s;&s;ed daily through the urethra, rather fibrous, putrid, and &s;carce more tenacious than coagulated blood.

This complaint had been of two years &s;tanding, and the patient previous to that time had been attacked with frequent and immoderate floodings. A court phy&s;ician, not a practi&s;er in midwifery, ordered the mo&s;t a&s;tringent remedies, as the bark, elixir of vitriol, tincture of ro&s;es, &amp;c.

<P>A GENTLEWOMAN, in the early part of life, had accidentally let a &s;mall pin drop into her ear, from which i&s;&s;ued a few drops of blood: lit|tle or no pain &s;ucceeded; but &s;ome time after a di&s;charge of a very fetid matter was perceived, and a deafne&s;s on that &s;ide. There was no &s;ecre|tion of wax. She was advi&s;ed, very properly, by an eminent &s;urgeon, not to &s;uffer the u&s;e of injec|tions, or any other applications; as in &s;o delicate an organ, that fine membrane, the tympanum, might be probably de&s;troyed, as likewi&s;e the little bones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malleus, incus and &s;tapes.</NOTE>, which form part of the mechanical &s;truc|ture of this curious organ. Satisfied with this opi|nion, nothing was attempted for years; but the di&s;charge continued, and was at times very offen|&s;ive. This lady had a fever in Augu&s;t 1774, of the putrid kind, with ulcerations in the throat, for which I was con&s;ulted. It terminated happily by the u&s;e of the common ante&s;eptic remedies; as bark, elixir of vitriol, vinegar drinks, &amp;c. &amp;c. After recovery, the di&s;charge from the ear was remarkably more offen&s;ive than before. This circum&s;tance was communicated to me. A fumi|gation of cinnabar factitium and aethiops minera|lis p. e. was u&s;ed, by means of a proper tube every other evening to the part. Internally twice in the day was taken the pulvis mineralis, to which was added a larger portion of the aethiops, and &s;ome aethiop. antim This plan was continued for near three months, during which time the di&s;|charge gradually decrea&s;ed, and entirely lo&s;t its offen&s;ive &s;mell. The powders were then directed without the fumigation; the ulcer was &s;oon after entirely healed; the wax was &s;ecreted; and the

<P>A CHILD four years old, daughter of Mrs. Williams, recommended by the over&s;eers of St. Giles's in the year 1773, had lo&s;t her &s;ight one year, from an inflammation in cutting her teeth. When the child was but eighteen months old, an inflammation of the eyes proved very trouble&s;ome; for which a phy&s;ician, reputedly &s;kilful in the cure of childrens di&s;ea&s;es, was con&s;ulted; but no benefit was received from his pre&s;cription. A very emi|nent practitioner was con&s;ulted in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance; who ordered a fomentation of white ro&s;e leaves, to be u&s;ed two hours in the day, and a powder to be blowed into the eyes. This plan was continued three months, and a lotion was u&s;ed. Six leeches were applied to the inner angles of the eye, and repeated twice; but no relief was obtain|ed. Application was then made to a celebrated foreigner; who ordered an i&s;&s;ue in the arm, and an ounce of magne&s;ia to be taken in a week. A phy&s;ician at an ho&s;pital ordered a bli&s;ter and an emetic.

At fir&s;t the pulvis mineralis was given three times in the day, and proper dre&s;&s;ings were applied; which, in the cour&s;e of a few weeks, produced very favourable appearances. The plan was continued, but the di&s;order &s;eemed to be at a &s;tand, neither growing better or wor&s;e. The pulvis mineralis was then omitted, and the pilula rubra three times in the day given; and in about three months all
<PB N="65" REF="68">the ulcers were healed. When this cure was ac|compli&s;hed, it was maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuated, that per|haps &s;udden death would be the con&s;equence. It is now four years &s;ince the cure has been con|firmed; no relap&s;e has happened; neither diarrhoea, fever or a&s;thma have attacked the patient; but, on the contrary, &s;he has better health than had been experienced for years. If the&s;e methods had been di&s;covered, and applied at fir&s;t, fifteen years of in|expre&s;&s;ible torture mo&s;t probably might have been prevented.</P>

When I fir&s;t &s;aw him he was exactly in the &s;ituation de&s;cribed. He was ordered the &s;olutio nitro&s;a, with the vinum antimoniale and the pilula rubra, three times in the day. The di&s;order proved ob&s;tinate; but the cure was effected by a per&s;everance in the above remedies, with proper

<P>A LADY of rank recommended a poor woman who had ulcers, about the eighth of an inch in di|ameter, in her leg, from the knee to the foot; the limb was exceedingly &s;welled, had a livid appear|ance in many parts. The &s;mell was extremely of|fen&s;ive; there were &s;caly &s;corbutic eruptions all over her body; and the mi&s;ery &s;he &s;uffered from pain was inexpre&s;&s;ible. She had applied to an ho&s;pital, and no relief had been obtained; but a propo&s;ition had been made to amputate the limb, as the only means of a cure. The &s;olutio nitro&s;a, with merc. corros. &s;ublimat. were given in this ca&s;e after a gentle laxative. The &s;al neutralis was admini&s;tered occa&s;ionally, and the medicines were continued for two months; during which time the di&s;ea&s;e had been mending, and the cure was accompli&s;hed. The ulcers were all healed, the leg was reduced to its natural &s;ize, and the &s;caly eruptions had entirely di&s;appeared.</P>

<P>MRS. B&mdash;, aged 40, for near twenty years had been tormented with an ulcer, which had been often healed, and as often became bad again. It was &s;itua|ted above the ancle on the in&s;ide; was not large but exceedingly painful, as is often the ca&s;e in very &s;mall deep ulcers. A great hardne&s;s &s;ur|rounded the &s;ore, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace; there were likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;corbutic eruptions, which itched much, and were very trouble&s;ome. The
<PB N="67" REF="70">pulvis mineralis was given, and for about two months &s;eemed to have excellent effects; for the eruptions and irritation were cured, and the cal|lo&s;ity greatly re&s;olved; but the ulcer did not heal. The bark and elix. vitriol. acid. was taken for &s;ome time. At fir&s;t the ulcer &s;eemed to be forming gra|nulations, and in a di&s;po&s;ition to incarn, but a &s;econd di&s;appointment happened. The pilula ru|bra was then given without any other medicine four times in the day, and a perfect cure was in about nine weeks after effected.

<P>Mr. B&mdash;, St. Paul's Church-yard, who had &s;uffered much mi&s;ery from the gout above twenty years, had the additional mortification to be af|flicted with a &s;mall ulcer near the ancle. I was con&s;ulted, and was dubious, whether it would be proper in a gouty patient to attempt any method of cure, and only then recommended a palliative dre&s;&s;ing. In about &s;ix months the ulcer had &s;o &s;pread it&s;elf, as to cover half the foot, and &s;ur|rounded the greate&s;t part of the ancle. Half a pint of a very &s;harp humour at lea&s;t was di&s;charged in a day; the pain was exqui&s;ite, had reduced the patient exceedingly, and he &s;eemed to be in an alarming &s;ituation. I ordered the pilula alba to be taken every other night ad gr. &s;s. and the part was dre&s;&s;ed with ung. album. The ulcer was bet|ter; a &s;it of the gout came on, the di&s;charge and irritation increa&s;ed. The gout &s;eemed to have no connection with the ulcerous indi&s;po&s;ition, nor the ulcer with the gout; for the di&s;charge, though con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, did not in the lea&s;t al|leviate
<PB N="68" REF="71">the pain. The &s;tomach was attacked with the gout, a draught was pre&s;cribed of the camphor, tinctura &s;tomach. and tinct. &s;acra. which removed it to the extremities. The knee, ancles and hands were affected. When the fit was over, the pill, which had been omitted during the paroxy&s;m was returned to, and the &s;ore parts were &s;oon perfectly healed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There has been di&s;covered a &s;afe and agreeable external application for the gout, which with certainty gives immedi|ate ea&s;e in the mo&s;t violent pains, and draws the di&s;order from the nobler parts towards the extremities.

This la&s;t patient, who is near 60, is one, who has experienced the happy effects, and can now walk better than he has been able to do for ten years.</NOTE>. A &s;pirituous tincture of hiera picra, in the do&s;e of a tea &s;poonful in a little water every day, one hour before dinner, has been recommended, and fifteen grains of the aethiops mineral. every other night. By this &s;imple me|thod, and a proper diet, has the gout, and rheu|mati&s;m, in &s;ome in&s;tances, though inveterate, and even in the &s;tomach, been radically cured.

<P>MRS. C&mdash;, aged between 40 and 50, of very full corpulent habit, had been many years di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed with an ulcer of the leg near the ancle.

<P>MR.

<P>IT is now &s;incerely hoped, that mankind will be no longer per&s;uaded, that it would be injurious to cure old ulcers; &s;o erroneou&s;ly con&s;idered a drain for peccant humours. It is highly proba|ble, in the&s;e complaints, that &s;ome part of a &s;cor|butic, or putrid acrimony, i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ore, is daily ab&s;orbed and conveyed to the blood and other juices by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and the whole habit is, by the&s;e means, contaminated. <HI>A bad con&s;titution is the general cau&s;e of the ul|cer, this afterwards becomes the cau&s;e of a wor&s;e con&s;titution; and while this reciprocal ac|tion is in force, the ulcer will be in no di&s;po&s;ition to heal.</HI> Whatever can gradually and impercep|tibly re&s;tore the fluids to a mild bal&s;amic &s;tate, and regulate the &s;ecretions and excretions, will be found beneficial in removing the&s;e &s;corbutic di&s;|tempers, &s;o predominant in this country. It may be a matter, perhaps, worthy the con&s;ideration of the &s;urgeons of ho&s;pitals, whether &s;uch rational methods of cure &s;hould not be embraced, which would &s;ave tho&s;e public charities a large annual expence. Experience confirms, that ninety five at lea&s;t out of a hundred may be radically cured as out-patients, at the &s;ame time obtain their livelihood by indu&s;try. A moderate exerci&s;e is &s;o far from retarding the cure, that it facilitates it, and renders the afflicted le&s;s liable to a relap&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME may po&s;&s;ibly imagine, that the common un&s;ucce&s;sful modes of treatment have been too freely cen&s;ured; but, let it be con&s;idered, that until erroneous &s;y&s;tems are exploded, no new di&s;coveries, however important, can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It gives me inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure to find, that &s;everal eminent practitioners, and &s;ome at the pub|lic ho&s;pitals, have adopted the&s;e new modes of treatment, and have candidly acknowledged, that con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s has attended their endea|vors. The oppo&s;ition the modes have experienced from others, may have ari&s;en from their being &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the practice they have been accu&s;tomed to. The facts here pro|duced, it is pre&s;umed, will convince them of their errors, and be the be&s;t an&s;wer to whatever may have been advanced again&s;t the doctrines.</P>
<P>Though the ha&s;ty adoption of novelties has fre|quently been productive of evils in the healing art; yet, an inflexible adherence to erroneous maxims, has proved a check to philo&s;ophical en|quiry; a bar to every u&s;eful improvement. The ca&s;es here related, the re&s;ult of many years appli|cation, are re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to the public con&s;ideration, and particularly to the unprejudiced and learned practitioners in medicine; who will be&s;t determine, whether they merit attention. The curative methods are, &s;till, it is pre&s;umed, capable of much improvement, and the &s;ame di&s;|po&s;ition which gave ri&s;e to the di&s;coveries, &s;hall not be wanting to pro&s;ecute &s;o de&s;irable a purpo&s;e.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="75">
<P>The ulcerated legs, the opacity of the cornea, partially, or totally impeding vi&s;ion, &s;corbutic, and &s;chrophulous ca&s;es, are proved, in general, to be curable. It could be ardently wi&s;hed, that the &s;ame might be a&s;&s;erted, with equal confidence, in confirmed cancerous di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e ravaging complaints, however, if not too far advanced, can frequently be removed. When poi&s;onous re|medies have been admini&s;tered, or other violent practices adopted, little &s;ucce&s;s can be expected; and often the cure is as impo&s;&s;ible, as in the aneu|ri&s;m of the aorta. The barbarous u&s;e of e&s;cha|rotics, and the unfeeling and improper u&s;e of the knife, have been condemned, in all ages, by every phy&s;ician of integrity and experience; as they have ha&s;tened the progre&s;s of the cancer, and the di&s;|&s;olution of the patient.</P>
