<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Stone</HI> in the Bladder is a Di&s;temper, which, for ought we know to the contrary, is as ancient as any other to which the humane Body has ever been &s;ub|ject: And <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> to whom we owe the fir&s;t Ac|counts of that, as well as of all the other Di&s;ea&s;es he has mention'd, informs us, that in his Time the Ope|ration of extracting the <HI>Stone</HI> by Cutting was already in U&s;e; and that there were Men who made it their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s, without intermedling with any other Part of Phy&s;ick or Surgery, which then, and for a great while afterwards, made up but one and the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion. All this is evident from that Clau&s;e of <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Oath, in which he makes his Di&s;ciples &s;wear not to cut any Per&s;on for the <HI>Stone,</HI> but to leave that Operation to &s;uch who exer|ci&s;ed them&s;elves in that Art, and made a particular Profe&s;&s;ion of it. <GAP DESC="foreign">. And from the&s;e Words there may be &s;ome ground to think, that <HI>Hippocrates</HI> never practis'd this Operation him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What was the Method of Cutting then us'd, we know not. Thus far however we may be &s;ure, that the Inci&s;ion was not propo&s;ed to be made in the Body of the Bladder; becau&s;e <HI>Hippocrates</HI> every where de|clares it to be his Opinion, that Wounds there are mortal. <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ays he, <HI>Aphor.</HI> 6, 18. and in his Book <HI>de Mor|bis</HI> 3. <GAP DESC="foreign">. The only further Conjecture that can with any Probability be formed is, that as <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> is univer&s;ally allowed to have borrowed his whole Sy&s;tem, both of Phy&s;ick and Surgery, from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the Method of Cutting for the <HI>Stone</HI> which he has de&s;cribed,
<PB N="2" REF="9">may likewi&s;e have been taken from them; and perhaps they knew no other but that. <HI>Ammonius,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Lithotomus</HI> from the In&s;trument he invented to break the <HI>Stone</HI> in the Bladder, when it happen'd to be too large to pa&s;s through the Wound entire, practis'd this Method at <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Herophilus</HI> and <HI>Era&s;i&s;tratus;</HI> that is, perhaps about 150 Years after <HI>Hippocrates;</HI> and <HI>Meges</HI> practis'd it at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> It is <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> who has pre&s;erved us the Names of the&s;e two famous Lithotomi&s;ts; and it is evident from what he &s;ays of them, that he believed their Method of Cutting to be the &s;ame with his. And as they lived at a great Di&s;tance, both of Time and Place, from one another; and the fir&s;t of them &s;o near the Age of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> it becomes from thence further probable, that the Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> de&s;crib'd by <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> was the mo&s;t ancient, and perhaps the only one that had ever been practis'd before his Time.</P>
<P>Whatever Solidity may be in the&s;e Conjectures, for I give them only as &s;uch, <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> is undoubtedly the fir&s;t Author now remaining, who has taught us any thing like a Method of Cutting; and the &s;ame, without any con&s;iderable Variation, is de&s;crib'd by the later <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, particularly <HI>Paulus Aegineta;</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Avicenna</HI> and <HI>Albuca&s;is;</HI> and, in general, by all Chirurgical Authors down to the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century, <HI>Rogerius, Rolan|dus, Brunus, Theodoricus, Gulielmus de Saliceto, Lanfrancus, Mundinus, Guido,</HI> and others. The&s;e Authors do little more than copy one another; and what is worth remarking about them is, that it does not appear that any of them ever &s;aw this Operation perform'd, <HI>Guido</HI> a|lone excepted; but even he does not &s;eem ever to have cut him&s;elf.</P>
<P>During all this long Interval, no other Method but this being known, we are not to imagine that it went by any other Name than that of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> or Operation of <HI>Lithotomy.</HI></P>
<P>But when <HI>Johannes de Romanis</HI> had invented his New Method of Cutting, which happen'd &s;ome Time near the Year 1500, at lea&s;t in all probability nearer that than 1520, as is &s;aid by <HI>Gourmelenus,</HI> and the generality of Writers &s;ince his Time; it then became nece&s;&s;ary that Names &s;hould be appropriated to the&s;e two Methods, by which they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="10">
<P>The principal Difference between them con&s;i&s;ts in the In&s;truments u&s;ed, and in the Manner of u&s;ing them; and therefore it was natural that the Names apply'd to them &s;hould be taken from thence. Ac|cordingly we find that <HI>De Franco</HI> calls <HI>Marianus</HI>'s Operation, <HI>La Cure de la Pierre avec gros ferrement;</HI> and from thence undoubtedly came the Appellations of <HI>Major</HI> and <HI>Minor Apparatus,</HI> by which the&s;e two Opera|rations have &s;ince been mo&s;t commonly expre&s;&s;ed; fir&s;t u&s;ed, as far as I can find, by <HI>Paraeus</HI> and <HI>Gourmelenus,</HI> as well as the <HI>French</HI> Names which an&s;wer to them, <HI>Le haut &amp; le petit Appareil.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Names of Cutting upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> and Cutting upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> are of a much later Date. We probably borrowed them from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in which Language the&s;e two ways of Cutting are expre&s;s'd by Terms analogous to them; and perhaps they came to be taken into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, by being u&s;ed by Lithomi&s;ts whom we have had oftener than once from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Second of the&s;e Methods, the <HI>Apparatus Major,</HI> was, as I have &s;aid, invented by <HI>Johannes de Romanis,</HI> and practis'd by him at <HI>Rome;</HI> but it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed there by his Scholar <HI>Marianus Sanctus Barolita|nus</HI> in the Year 1522, not at <HI>Venice</HI> in 1535, as &s;ome have &s;aid. And it is upon this Account, that Authors who do not &s;o much attend to Di&s;|coverers, as to the Publi&s;hers of Di&s;coveries, have given it the Name of <HI>Methodus Mariana</HI> or <HI>Mariniana.</HI></P>
<P>This Operation being &s;uited to Per&s;ons of all Ages, whereas that of <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> was formerly thought practicable only upon Children, &s;oon gain'd a general Vogue, and brought Lithotomy much more in Fa&s;hion than it had been for many Ages before. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI>'s Method, however, was not quite laid a&s;ide, but continued to be practi&s;ed; and perhaps even more frequently than it had ever been &s;ince <HI>Aegineta</HI>'s Days; with this Advan|tage al&s;o, that the Succe&s;s of the other Method being experienced in full grown Per&s;ons as well as Children, encouraged Lithotomi&s;ts to break through the narrow Limits of Time fixed by the Ancients, and ex|tend the U&s;e of <HI>Cel&s;us</HI>'s Method much further than <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> him&s;elf had pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>From this Time downwards, the Practice of Lithotomy becoming &s;till more common, a great many Improvements were made in both Me|thods, e&s;pecially in that of <HI>Marianus;</HI> and other Varieties introduced
<PB N="4" REF="11">in them, as be&s;t &s;uited the Genius of particular Operators, the Con|dition of the Patients, or the Humour of the Times; and in all the&s;e the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Lithotomi&s;ts mu&s;t be allowed to have had the principal Hand.</P>
<P>In the Year 1561, <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Treati&s;e of <HI>Hernia</HI>'s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was fir&s;t pub|li&s;hed, and in that he gives an Account of a new Method he once made u&s;e of in order to extract a <HI>Stone,</HI> all the others proving ineffectual, and that was by making an Inci&s;ion above the <HI>Os Pubis.</HI> Tho' the Opera|tion &s;ucceeded, yet he thinks fit to di&s;&s;wade all Per&s;ons from ever fol|lowing his Example; and indeed his Advice was &s;o far comply'd with, that for above Twenty Years after his Book appeared, Authors are as entirely &s;ilent about this extraordinary Operation, as if it had never been known; and in all Probability would have continued &s;o much longer, had not a lucky Chance engaged a Per&s;on of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI>'s Learning and Sagacity, to undertake the introducing of the <HI>Cae&s;arean</HI> Operation: For, in order to recommend this unheard-of and dangerous Practice, one Method this great Man thought it for his Purpo&s;e to take, was to compare it with &s;ome others then in U&s;e; and, among&s;t the re&s;t, with the common ways of Cutting for the <HI>Stone.</HI> This led him to &s;o clear and terrifying a View of the Cruelty and Barbarity of both of them, that a Per&s;on of his Talent for Invention needed no more to put him upon the Search of a New one; and the Pains he had been at to con&s;i|der the Nature and Con&s;equences of Wounds in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> was un|doubtedly what gave him the fir&s;t Hint of that which he invented. <HI>De Franco</HI> mu&s;t indeed be own'd to have publi&s;hed an In&s;tance of this Ope|ration before <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI> endeavoured to introduce it: But <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI> is not for that Rea&s;on to be denied the Glory of having invented it; for, to &s;ay nothing of the Circum&s;tances of <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Story, which every body is now &s;ufficiently acquainted with, <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI> was led to the Theory he e&s;tabli&s;hed by the meer Force of his own Judgment, his Knowledge of the Structure of the Parts concerned, in which he exceeded all that went before him, <HI>Ve&s;alius</HI> him&s;elf not excepted, and Con&s;equences drawn from Facts, among which that mention'd by <HI>Franco</HI> appears to have no Place, <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI> having di&s;cover'd his Method before ever he had &s;een that Author's Book, as he affirms him&s;elf, and in a manner that gives not the lea&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect him of a Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>But if it &s;hould be granted that he took the fir&s;t Hint of his Me|thod from <HI>Franco,</HI> be mu&s;t &s;till be allowed by all who have read and
<PB N="5" REF="12">under&s;tand his Book, to de&s;erve a greater &s;hare of Prai&s;e as an Im|prover, than the other can claim as an Inventer: And I believe it will be found upon a &s;trict Examination, that the Honour of many Di&s;cove|ries which we now enjoy, is given to Per&s;ons who had no better Title to them than he has to this, even &s;uppo&s;ing he had borrowed from <HI>De Franco</HI> all that he could po&s;&s;ibly borrow from him. He mu&s;t be very little acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of Inventers, who does not know that many of their Inventions are owing to more favourable Ac|cidents, than reading <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Book can have been to <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this great Author lived to publi&s;h a compleat Account of his new Method of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> (which has by Writers in <HI>Latin</HI> been generally called <HI>Sectio Hypoga&s;trica;</HI> by the <HI>French, Le haut Appareil;</HI> and in <HI>Engli&s;h, The High Operation</HI>) yet he never had an Opportunity of performing it upon a living Body; and for above 130 Years after him, none &s;eem'd ever &s;o much as inclinable to make Tryal of it. The Writers of Lithotomy, during that Time, have mo&s;t of them in|deed mention'd this Operation; but in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hews very plainly that few of them had ever read <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI>'s Book, and that not one of them under&s;tood it. The Authority of <HI>De Franco,</HI> who forbids the attempting of this Method, and of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who thought all Wounds in the Bladder mortal, are the common Topicks they make u&s;e of to cry it down; and all this mo&s;t commonly in the Compa&s;s of half a Page, from which an intelligent Reader can gather no more, than barely that it had been once propos'd in <HI>France</HI> to cut for the <HI>Stone</HI> above the <HI>Os Pubis. Dionis,</HI> it is true, has been at a little more Pains about it than the re&s;t, and had probably heard &s;omething of <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI>'s Method; but then he is &s;o &s;upinely negligent in all the Parts of his Account, that one would be ready to think he mentions it at all, not &s;o much with a de&s;ign to recommend it to Practice, as to have &s;omething to &s;ay, and to make way for a new Figure in his Book, which &s;hould not be found in the other Treati&s;es of Chirurgical Operations.</P>
<P>From the&s;e lame and imperfect Scraps, my Brother took the fir&s;t Hints of this Method, having, as I am very well &s;atisfied, never &s;een <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI>'s <HI>Latin</HI> Treati&s;e till he had compo&s;ed the whole Theory of his Operation, and perform'd it &s;ucce&s;sfully on living Bodies. To him therefore may be applied what I have &s;aid about <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that Author to have read <HI>De Franco</HI>'s Story before he invented his Opera|tion.
<PB N="6" REF="13">But even <HI>Ro&s;&s;etus</HI> him&s;elf mu&s;t yield to him the Honour of having introduced the Practice of it; and for this, con&s;idering the Di&s;courage|ment he met with, the Difficulties he had to overcome, and on the other hand, how highly this Method has already conduced to the Pre&s;er|vation of Mankind, no Prai&s;e nor no Reward can be too great.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort View that I have given of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> it will appear, that properly &s;peaking there are but two Ways po&s;&s;ible of extracting the <HI>Stone</HI> out of the Bladder by Inci&s;ion; and the&s;e are, making the Wound either above or below the <HI>Os Pubis.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e, if rightly practis'd, admits of no con&s;iderable Variety; in the &s;econd, there is a greater Latitude, not only in re&s;pect of the In&s;truments u&s;ed, and the &s;everal Steps of the Operation, but al&s;o in the Place of the Inci&s;ion. All the&s;e may be, and actually have been, compounded and combined together by Lithotomi&s;ts in a great many different manners, and it would be hard to prove that any two of them ever cut exactly the &s;ame Way; but to avoid as much as can be done all unnece&s;&s;ary Subdivi&s;ions, I think the different Methods of extracting a <HI>Stone</HI> by Cutting below the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> may be reduced to three kinds; that of <HI>Cel|&s;us,</HI> that of <HI>Marianus,</HI> and what I have cho&s;en to call the <HI>Lateral Way</HI> fir&s;t practis'd by <HI>Frere Jacques.</HI> The two fir&s;t, as has been already ob|&s;erved, differ from one another chiefly in the In&s;truments and Steps of the Operation, and the la&s;t differs from both the&s;e in the Place of the Inci&s;ion.</P>
<P>To this Method I &s;hall confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, referring the compleat Hi&s;tory of the other two, together with the High Opera|tion, to another Opportunity; and in treating it, I intend to ob&s;erve this Order,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;et down, from all the Authors I have met with, the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frere Jaques,</HI> his two Methods of Cutting Males, and the Succe&s;s with which they were attended.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall compare the different Accounts which have been given of the &s;everal Parts of his Operations with one another, that thereby it may clearly appear wherein they really con&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="14">
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall relate the Opinions of Authors concerning his Ope|rations, and the Grounds upon which their Opinions have been found|ed. The&s;e, as is ea&s;y to conceive, are chiefly the Ob&s;ervations made on the dead Bodies of &s;uch as he had cut.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;et down his Method of Cutting Females, and the Judgments that have been made thereof.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e four general Heads will be contained the whole Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Lateral Operation for the Stone,</HI> as it was perform'd by this Monk; and from thence we are naturally led to con&s;ider the Improvements that have been made of it; fir&s;t tho&s;e propo&s;ed by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> and then &s;uch as were contrived and put in Practice by Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Rau.</HI></P>
<P>For the Matter of all this Hi&s;tory, I mu&s;t be obliged to Books; no|thing can be called mine, except the Order in which I have dige&s;ted it. What Authors I have chiefly con&s;ulted, the Reader will &s;ee in the Be|ginning of the fir&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e this Introduction, I mu&s;t further acquaint the Reader, that I intend that the Hi&s;tory of this <HI>Lateral Operation</HI> &s;hall be followed in a very &s;hort time, by that of the other three general Methods of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> in three &s;eparate Treati&s;es. To the&s;e I &s;hall add a fifth, containing the Anatomy, and Figures of the Parts concerned in them all; the Figures of all the In&s;truments that have been u&s;ed; and la&s;tly, my own Ob&s;ervations concerning the Advantages and Inconveni|encies with which each of them are attended; and in what Ca&s;es I judge any of them, taken all together, to be preferable to the re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frere Jaques</HI> Methods of Cutting Males.</HEAD>
<P>_THE fir&s;t Account that I find to have been ever publi&s;hed of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations for the <HI>Stone,</HI> is contained in a Letter written by Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere,</HI> a skilful and experienced Surgeon in <HI>London,</HI> and F. R. S. to Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> and in&s;erted in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> for the Month of <HI>March</HI> 1699. The Author begins by de&s;cribing the In|&s;truments u&s;ed in the&s;e Operations, and the Me|thod of performing them, according to the Informations he had re|ceived from <HI>Paris;</HI> then he &s;ets down the Opinion of his <HI>French</HI> Corre|&s;pondent about them; and la&s;tly, &s;ubjoins his own, founded on &s;everal Experiments he had made on dead Bodies.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> publi&s;hed his Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> and among&s;t other Curio&s;ities, he has given us &s;ome Account of <HI>Frere Jacques.</HI> The Doctor went Phy&s;ician to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> who was &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France</HI> by King <HI>William</HI> after the Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick;</HI> and during his Abode at <HI>Paris,</HI> he had the good Fortune to &s;ee <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> &s;everal times cut for the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after that, appeared a <HI>French</HI> Treati&s;e with this Title, <HI>Ob&s;ervations &s;ur la Maniere de Tailler dans les deux Sexes pour l'Extraction de la Pierre, pra|tiqu&eacute;e par Frere Jacques, par Jean Mery, Chirurgien de la fe&uuml;e Reine, &amp; Ana|tomi&s;te de l'Academie Royale de Sciences;</HI> printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> and pre&s;ently afterwards at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> both in the Year 1700. This excellent Au|thor has left almo&s;t nothing un&s;aid that relates either to the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations, or the various Succe&s;s with which they were attended in <HI>France;</HI> and he has likewi&s;e &s;hown, at very great length, the Rea&s;ons of the Inconveniencies that follow upon them, and the Way by which he thinks the&s;e may be remedied: But, as it is to him that
<PB N="10" REF="16">we mu&s;t be chiefly obliged for all that can with certainty be affirm'd about them, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to make any more particular Ab&s;tract of his Book in this Place.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Year that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations were publi&s;h'd, the <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> Journali&s;ts gave an Extract of it; but, as I &s;hall have occa|ca&s;ion to remark as I go along, they do not &s;eem always to have hit the true Sen&s;e of the Author.</P>
<P><HI>Saviard,</HI> in a Collection of Chirurgical Operations publi&s;hed at <HI>Paris</HI> in 1702, has likewi&s;e mention'd tho&s;e of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> for the <HI>Stone,</HI> but refers entirely to <HI>Mery</HI> for an Account of them; and indeed, by the few Things he has &s;aid about them, he appears to have been very un|fit for that Task him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dionis</HI> is the next who affords us any thing further re|markable upon this Head. In his Book of Chirurgical Operations publi&s;hed at <HI>Paris</HI> in 1707, he has given a very di&s;tinct and methodi|cal Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations. The principal Facts he men|tions are, or might have been taken from <HI>Mery;</HI> and to the&s;e he has added &s;ome others, which, as he lived and practis'd in <HI>Paris</HI> while <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> was there, and &s;aw him &s;everal times cut, it could be no hard matter for him to collect.</P>
<P><HI>Goelick,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of Surgery 1713, has tran&s;cribed the Extract of <HI>Mery</HI>'s Book from the <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> Acts; and Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden,</HI> in his Trea|ti&s;e on the High Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> 1723, has abridged the Ac|count of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> given us by <HI>Dionis;</HI> but yet differs from him in &s;ome Things.</P>
<P>The learned Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Albinus</HI> has made a few Ob&s;ervations on the &s;ame Subject, introductory to the accurate Account he has lately publi&s;hed of Mr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s Method: And it is from the&s;e Nine Authors that I have extracted the following Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations for the <HI>Stone;</HI> tho' in reality they may all be reduced to Three; the other Six having told us nothing worth minding, but what they have borrowed from <HI>Ba&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ere, Mery</HI> and <HI>Dionis.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="17">
<P>We know but very little concerning this Man's Original, Education, Life or Character, in any other re&s;pect than as a Lithotomi&s;t. The Name he gave him&s;elf was <HI>Jacques Beaulieu,</HI> and he &s;aid he was born in <HI>Beaufort,</HI> a Town or Village of the Di&s;trict of <HI>Long &s;aunier,</HI> in what is call'd the County of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> (1)</P>
<P>All our Authors agree that he was a Monk of &s;ome one kind or other; but of what Order or In&s;titution is not &s;o certain. Mr. <HI>Bu&s;|&s;iere</HI> calls him an Hermit; (2) and this &s;eems to be confirm'd by what we are told by <HI>Dionis,</HI> that he had framed to him&s;elf a Rule of Religion back'd with Vows, which he left it to his Bi&s;hop for the Time being to di&s;pen&s;e him from at Plea&s;ure. (3) For at this time, as I have been inform'd, an Hermit in <HI>France</HI> is commonly a Per&s;on, who, being with|out Education, and having either &s;pent his Sub&s;tance, or been born to none, a&s;&s;ociates him&s;elf with one or two (never more) of the &s;ame Stamp, and finding means to get a Gift of &s;ome few Acres of Ground in a &s;olitary Place near a great Town, and Liberty from the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e to erect a Hermitage, together with what they call a Rule to be ob&s;erved in it, fir&s;t build them&s;elves little Cells, and then by ma|nuring the re&s;t of the Land, &s;elling little Trinkets which they make, and the Charity of well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, &s;upply them&s;elves with all the Nece&s;&s;aries, and mo&s;t commonly even the Conveniencies of Life. What makes it further probable that our Monk was of this kind is, the Ignorance and want of Education, which both <HI>Mery</HI> and <HI>Dionis</HI> have ob&s;erved in him.</P>
<P><HI>Mery</HI> tells us he was a Brother of the Third Order of St. <HI>Francis;</HI> a Sett of <HI>Mendicant</HI> Monks, who differ indeed very much from Hermits, becau&s;e they live in great Communities, and are tied up to a &s;tricter Rule of Life; but among&s;t tho&s;e they call Brothers of that Order, there are many &s;o perfectly void of all &s;orts of Education, that they cannot &s;o much as read their own Mother Tongue. (4)</P>
<P><HI>Dionis</HI> &s;ays he wore the Habit of a <HI>Recolet,</HI> except that he had Shoes in&s;tead of Sandals, and a Hat in&s;tead of a Cowl. The <HI>Recolets</HI> are &s;uch Monks of the fir&s;t or great Order of <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> call'd in <HI>France, Corde|liers</HI> or <HI>Freres Mineurs,</HI> who embraced the Reformation that was &s;ome time ago made among&s;t them; and if what <HI>Dionis</HI> here &s;ays be &s;trictly true, our Monk might &s;till be a Hermit, but could not be of the Third Order as <HI>Mery</HI> pretends he was. (5)</P>
<PB N="12" REF="18">
<P>But of whatever Order he was, or whether of any Order or not, none of the&s;e Authors give us the lea&s;t ground to think he was ever admitted to Holy Orders; and the Appellation of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> which <HI>Dionis</HI> &s;ays he took to him&s;elf, is Proof enough to any body who has had Occa|&s;ion to inform him&s;elf of the Cu&s;toms of the&s;e Monks in <HI>France,</HI> that he never was. (6) And therefore it is, I believe, pretty much without ground, that Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> terms him an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, (7) a Name &s;eldom given to any but the Secular Clergy, and never to a Friar who is not a Prie&s;t. Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> indeed, and his Corre&s;pondent Mr. <HI>Probie,</HI> both call him <HI>Pere Jacques;</HI> but he is never &s;o termed by the <HI>French</HI> Authors, who under&s;tand the Propriety of &s;uch De&s;ignations better than Strangers.</P>
<P><HI>Albinus</HI> contents him&s;elf to call him in general a Monk, and &s;uch in &s;ome Sen&s;e or other he undoubtedly was; and this is all that can with any certainty be affirmed about his Profe&s;&s;ion. (9)</P>
<P>His ordinary Re&s;idence he pretended was in an Ho&s;pital called <HI>La Charit&eacute;</HI> at <HI>Be&s;an&ccedil;on,</HI> the Capital of the Province of <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;,</HI> erected for the Maintainance of poor aged People and Children. (10) His outward Behaviour had all the Appearances of Probity and Simplicity; he lived on nothing but Bread and ordinary Soupes, de&s;pi&s;ed Money, and never asked for any but only a few Pence to &s;et his In&s;truments and mend his Shoes. (11)</P>
<P>But to come nearer our pre&s;ent De&s;ign, the Hi&s;tory of his Operations for the <HI>Stone, Mery</HI> informs us, that his natural Character was very much &s;uited to them; he was of an intrepid and undaunted Courage and Re|&s;olution, had a &s;ure and &s;teddy Hand, and went about whatever he undertook without the lea&s;t He&s;itation, Faultering or &s;ign of Fear. The&s;e natural Talents were, however, the only ones he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; Art he was a perfect Stranger to, being altogether ignorant of Anatomy, and the regular Operations of Surgery. (12) Neither is it without ground that <HI>Dionis</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Intrepidity and Quickne&s;s with which he perform'd his Operations, were owing to nothing &s;o much as his being in&s;en&s;ible of the Danger that attended his Mi&s;carriages.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="19">
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it may be ju&s;tly wonder'd how he came ever to attempt Cutting for the <HI>Stone</HI> at all. This is a My&s;tery which no Au|thor but <HI>Mery</HI> has endeavoured to explain, and he has done it but very imperfectly. By comparing his natural Character with that of <HI>Raoux,</HI> a famous Impo&s;tor, their Curing of <HI>Hernia's,</HI> and likewi&s;e their Method of Operating for the <HI>Stone,</HI> he imagines that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> might have been <HI>Raoux</HI>'s Di&s;ciple, and learnt &s;ome Part of his Operations from him; and from thence, and what he had taken from the Method com|monly practis'd when he began to cut, have invented the re&s;t. (13) But this will be better under&s;tood when we have explained wherein his Ope|rations con&s;i&s;ted; and that, together with the Series of his Practice, as far as our Authors have handed it down to us, is what we now pro|ceed to.</P>
<P>That he had cut for the <HI>Stone</HI> many times before he went to <HI>Paris,</HI> is evident from the great Number of Atte&s;tations which he brought along with him from <HI>Be&s;an&ccedil;on,</HI> and &s;everal Towns and Villages in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and other Provinces of <HI>France.</HI> He boa&s;ted extremely of the Succe&s;s he had had, and his Credentials &s;eem'd to confirm all he &s;aid; however, it appear'd &s;oon after, by Letters from the&s;e Provinces, that the&s;e Atte&s;ta|tions were given upon too &s;light grounds, and before any other Effect of his Operations, be&s;ides bare extracting the <HI>Stone,</HI> could be perceiv'd: his Way being to run from Place to Place, where there was any Employ|ments for him; and as &s;oon as he had perform'd an Operation, to en|gage the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Spectators to &s;ign a Certificate in his Favour, without ever allowing them Time to &s;ee whether the Patient re|covered or not; and when he had cut all that came in his way in one Place, he immediately left it and ha&s;tened to another, being &s;ollicitous about nothing but to make his Dexterity appear in taking out the <HI>Stone,</HI> and not at all about what &s;hould become of the Patient after the Ope|ration. (14)</P>
<P>This is all we know of him before he arrived in <HI>Paris,</HI> which hap|pened in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1697. The Occa&s;ion of that Journey he gave out to be no other than to teach the Surgeons of the Ho&s;pitals there a new Way of Cutting for the <HI>Stone:</HI> And having found means to get an Acquaintance with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mare&s;chal,</HI> afterwards Fir&s;t Sur|geon to the <HI>French</HI> King, he endeavoured by his Intere&s;t to obtain leave to Cut in the Ho&s;pital of <HI>La Charit&eacute;;</HI> but the Surgeons there, as well as tho&s;e of the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> being unwilling to tru&s;t the Lives of their
<PB N="14" REF="20">Patients in the Hands of a Stranger, of who&s;e Abilities they were alto|gether ignorant, de&s;ired him fir&s;t to make &s;ome Experiments in their Pre&s;ence upon dead Bodies, which he readily con&s;ented to; and accord|ingly, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dionis</HI> relates, he perform'd his Operation on a Body, into the Bladder of which a <HI>Stone</HI> had been convey'd before by the Surgeons of the <HI>Charit&eacute;,</HI> but not at all to their Satisfaction. (15)</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> who was appointed by the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of <HI>Paris</HI> (whom the <HI>Leip&s;ick Journali&s;ts</HI> have mi&s;taken for the Pre&s;ident of the Royal Academy,) 16 to in&s;pect the&s;e Experiments of <HI>Frere Jaques</HI> Operation, &s;ays nothing of any that were perform'd at the <HI>Charit&eacute;;</HI> and concerning tho&s;e which he was Witne&s;s to at the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> he makes quite a different Judgment from what <HI>Dionis</HI> &s;ays was made by all the Surgeons who were pre&s;ent at that which he mentions.</P>
<P>On the 7th Day of <HI>December,</HI> &s;ays Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> I received Orders from the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident to go to the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> and be pre&s;ent at the Extraction of a <HI>Stone</HI> out of the Bladder of a dead Body by <HI>Frere Jacques.</HI> He perform'd the Operation in this manner.</P>
<P>Having introduced into the Bladder a &s;olid round <HI>Staff</HI> without a <HI>Groove,</HI> and of a different Figure from tho&s;e u&s;ed in the old Way of Cutting, he took a <HI>Bi&s;toury</HI> like the common ones, only longer; and with that made an Inci&s;ion on the Left and In&s;ide of the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> and cutting obliquely from below upwards, he divided whatever came in his way between that Protuberance and his <HI>Staff,</HI> which he kept &s;till in the Bladder. His Inci&s;ion being fini&s;hed, he thru&s;t his Finger through the Wound into the Bladder, to find out the <HI>Stone;</HI> and having ob&s;erved where it lay, he introduced an In&s;trument into the Bladder, of the Figure hereafter repre&s;ented, to dilate the Wound, that the <HI>Stone</HI> might have more room to come out, Upon this <HI>Dilator,</HI> which he calls his <HI>Conductor,</HI> he thru&s;t in a Pair of <HI>Forceps,</HI> and then drew out the <HI>Conductor;</HI> having felt for and laid hold of the <HI>Stone,</HI> he pulled the <HI>Staff</HI> out of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> then his <HI>Forceps</HI> and the <HI>Stone</HI> along with it. All this he did with a wonderful Facility, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Stone</HI> was as big as an Hen's Egg.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="21">
<P>The Operation being fini&s;hed, I di&s;&s;ected the Parts which had been cut in Pre&s;ence of the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons of the <HI>Hotel Dieu;</HI> by that means, and by comparing at the &s;ame time the&s;e Parts with tho&s;e of the other Side, we ob&s;erv'd that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> had cut fir&s;t about an Inch and an half deep in Fat, that from thence he had carried his Knife between the <HI>Mu&s;culus Erector</HI> and the <HI>Left Accelerator,</HI> but without wounding either of them; and la&s;tly, that he cut through the whole Length of the Neck of the Bladder on one Side, and about half an Inch of the Body of it.</P>
<P>Two Days after this Experiment I waited on the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, to give him an Account of my Ob&s;ervations, and at the &s;ame time my Opinion concerning <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation: My Report was con|ceiv'd in the&s;e Terms.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<Q><P>"<HI>FRere Jacques</HI> Method of Cutting appears to me to be much preferable to that commonly practis'd, becau&s;e the Inci&s;ion being made both in the Neck and Body of the Bladder, and the <HI>Stone</HI> extracted at the broade&s;t part of the Angle made by the <HI>O&s;&s;a Pubis,</HI> comes out with great Ea&s;e, and without the lea&s;t Force: But in the common Operation, as the Inci&s;ion is only made in the <HI>Ure|thra,</HI> and the <HI>Stone</HI> drawn through the Neck of the Bladder, which remains entire, and at the narrowe&s;t part of the Angle of the <HI>O&s;&s;a Pubis,</HI> it is evident that the Extraction of the <HI>Stone</HI> through &s;uch &s;trait Pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t be very difficult, and require a great deal of Force when of any con&s;iderable Bigne&s;s; from whence it is ea&s;y to conclude, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation will not be liable to &s;uch dangerou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Accidents as are found to attend the other; and that for the&s;e Rea&s;ons,"</P>
<P>"1. Becau&s;e in his Way of Operating he cuts none of the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Penis;</HI> whereas in the common Way the two <HI>Accelerators</HI> are entirely &s;eparated from one another, by the Inci&s;ion which is made of the Place of their Union, that is, at their Origin; by which means the&s;e Mu&s;cies happen very frequently to lo&s;e their Action."</P>
<PB N="16" REF="22">
<P>"2. In making his Operation it mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that he cuts the Body of the <HI>Pro&s;tates,</HI> the whole Neck of the Bladder on one Side, and a little of the Body; but the&s;e Parts having no con&s;idera|ble Blood Ve&s;&s;els belonging to them, an <HI>Haemorage</HI> is not &s;o much to be feared as in the common Operation, in which the Inci&s;ion is made in the &s;pungy and thick part of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> which receive a great Quantity of Blood from the two Arteries of the <HI>Penis.</HI>"</P>
<P>"3. His Operation can neither be followed by an <HI>Echymo&s;is,</HI> Fluxion nor Suppuration in the Membranes of the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> which happen &s;o frequently after the other; becau&s;e the Place by which he gets into the Bladder has not the &s;ame Communication with the <HI>Scrotum</HI> as the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> in which the other Lithotomi&s;ts begin their Inci&s;ion."</P>
<P>"4. By making a large Wound in the Neck and Body of the Blad|der, through which he ea&s;ily draws out the <HI>Stone,</HI> he evites the Con|tu&s;ion and Tearing, which in the common Operation almo&s;t con&s;tantly happens, both to the Neck of the Bladder and <HI>Pro&s;tates</HI> which are joined to it, and even to the <HI>Urethra</HI> it&s;elf when the <HI>Stone</HI> is large, or its Surface rugged. And from hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the Parts which he divides being only &s;imply cut, will very ea&s;ily reunite after the Operation, and by this means Fi&s;tulas be in a great mea&s;ure prevented; whereas in the common Method, the Parts &s;uffering mo&s;t commonly cau&s;e a violent Contu&s;ion, and a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s of Sub&s;tance by Suppuration, their Re-union is retarded, and thus Fi|&s;tulas are occa&s;ioned: But, however, I am inclin'd to believe, that if <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> made his Inci&s;ion two Inches higher up than the Place where he now begins it, he might get into the Bladder in the &s;ame manner, and yet the Wound not be &s;o deep, and con&s;equently &s;ooner healed; &s;uppo&s;ing always that Wounds in the Neck and Body of the Bladder are not mortal, as has been hitherto believed, and that the <HI>Sphincter Mu&s;cle</HI> may be reunited as exactly as it was before, which Experience alone mu&s;t determine."</P>
<P>"As for the In&s;truments he u&s;es, I cannot find that they are any ways preferable to ours. On the contrary, his <HI>Staff</HI> &s;eems to be much more inconvenient, both becau&s;e it forces the lower Part of the <HI>Urethra</HI> too far outwards, and becau&s;e not being <HI>Grooved</HI> it cannot be &s;o &s;urely cut upon; for let <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> have never &s;o &s;teddy a Hand,
<PB N="17" REF="23">the Point of his <HI>Bi&s;toury</HI> mu&s;t be apt to &s;lide either to one Side or o|ther, upon a <HI>Staff</HI> which is exactly round."</P>
<P>"The <HI>Conductor</HI> which he thru&s;ts into the Bladder after the Wound is made, is not at all proper to direct his <HI>Forceps</HI> thither, and can be of no manner of Service to dilate the Inci&s;ion made in the Neck and and Body of the Bladder, becau&s;e that Inci&s;ion is longer than the <HI>Conductor</HI> is broad; and be&s;ides the Wound may be dilated by the <HI>Forceps</HI> with this Advantage, that the Dilatation will never be more than is nece&s;&s;ary, which is what no other Dilator can do.</P></Q>
</LETTER>
<P>The Account I have here given of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mary</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations made on di&s;&s;ecting the Parts cut by <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> in this fir&s;t Tryal of his Operation, did not properly belong to this Part of my Hi&s;tory; in which my De&s;ign is not to con&s;ider either the Structure of the Parts concerned in this Method of Cutting, nor the Judgment that has or may be formed from thence concerning the Advantages and Inconveniencies thereof. This I re&s;erve for a di&s;tinct Head: But as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> did afterwards re|tract the greate&s;t part of the favourable Opinion he had here conceiv'd of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> upon a more full In&s;ight into his Operation; and as this is the fir&s;t Tryal that we have any certain Account ever to have been made of it; I judged it nece&s;&s;ary in entering upon the Hi&s;tory of this Method of Cutting, to make the Reader thus far acquainted with the Nature of it, that the Sequel of this Relation might be the more ea|&s;ily under&s;tood.</P>
<P>What Effect this Report had upon the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, and the other Per&s;ons to whom it was communicated, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has not in|form'd us; nor of any thing el&s;e that happen'd before the &s;econd Expe|riment was made, which was ju&s;t a Week after the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 14th Day of the &s;ame Month of <HI>December,</HI> continues our Au|thor, I went to the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> by a &s;econd Order of the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, to &s;ee <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> perform his Operation a &s;econd time. He cut the dead Body of a Child between Twelve and Fourteen Years of Age, and likewi&s;e of a Woman; into the Bladders of which <HI>Stones</HI> had been put as before. He cut the Boy exactly in the &s;ame manner as he did the Man, and I di&s;&s;ected the Parts cut in Pre&s;ence of the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons of the <HI>Hotel Dieu.</HI> (17)</P>
<PB N="18" REF="24">
<P>What was the Re&s;ult of our Author's Ob&s;ervations we &s;hall &s;ee el&s;e|where; as likewi&s;e the Account he here gives of <HI>Frere Jaques</HI> Method of Cutting Women. It is &s;ufficient to remark in this Place, that the Judgment he makes of both the&s;e Operations was not near &s;o favoura|ble to the Monk as the former had been; and it may very well be, that this was the Rea&s;on of his leaving <HI>Paris</HI> &s;o abruptly, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dionis</HI> informs us, tho' he has by Mi&s;take placed the Time of his Journey two Months too early.</P>
<P>The Court was then at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> and thither our Operator re|&s;olved to &s;teer his Cour&s;e. Upon his Arrival, he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Che&s;ne,</HI> fir&s;t Phy&s;ician to the Princes of the Blood, having found means to procure &s;ome Letters of Recommendation to him, and we may be &s;ure he did not forget to &s;how him his whole Bundle of Certificates. Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Che&s;ne</HI> was charm'd with the Account the Monk gave him of his De&s;ign in going to <HI>Paris,</HI> his Method of Cutting, and the great Number of Operations which he had per|form'd: And out of a Zeal for the Welfare of his Fellow-Creatures, which can never be enough commended, he mentioned him to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Fagon,</HI> fir&s;t Phy&s;ician to the King; to M. <HI>Bourdelot,</HI> fir&s;t Phy&s;ician to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> and to &s;everal others be&s;ides; who all concluded that it would be worth while to &s;ee him cut: And for this purpo&s;e a Shoe-maker's Boy of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> then at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> and who was troubled with the <HI>Stone,</HI> luckily offered him&s;elf. Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Che&s;ne</HI> immediately &s;ent him to a Nur&s;e, and ordered him all manner of Nece&s;&s;aries. <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> perform'd the Operation in Pre&s;ence of the Phy&s;icians, and of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Felix,</HI> then fir&s;t Surgeon to the King. The Succe&s;s an&s;wer'd their Expectation, and they were all perfectly &s;a|tisfied with what they had &s;een, e&s;pecially Mon&s;ieur <HI>Felix;</HI> who from that Moment took <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> home to his Hou&s;e, and kept him there all the time he &s;taid at <HI>Fontainbleau.</HI></P>
<P>This Operation we may ea&s;ily conceive made a great Noi&s;e, and was publi&s;hed all over the Court. The Princes of the Blood were in|form'd of it by Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Che&s;ne,</HI> and he gave them an Account every Day of the Progre&s;s of the Cure. As for his own part, he look'd upon the Monk as a Man &s;ent by God for the Relief of tho&s;e who were af|flicted with the <HI>Stone,</HI> by a more ea&s;y and le&s;s dangerous Method than any that had till then been known; and, indeed the fir&s;t Effects of his Operation on the Shoemaker were extremely happy. It was perform'd
<PB N="19" REF="25">very quickly, the Urine came out through the ordinary Pa&s;&s;age a very &s;hort time after; no bad Accident &s;uperveen'd, and the Patient was able to go abroad in three Weeks Time. (18)</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Operation that ever we hear <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> per|form'd, after his Arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> on a living Body. It happen'd at Court, to which he went of his own Accord, not by Invitation, as we are told by Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden;</HI> and by the Succe&s;s of that, not by the Repu|tation he had acquired by tho&s;e he had cut before, he recommended him&s;elf to the Court.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dionis</HI> goes on to <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Manner of Cutting; but the Account thereof &s;ent to Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> from <HI>Paris,</HI> being prior to his in order of Time, it mu&s;t for that rea&s;on be in&s;erted before it. Here is the De&s;cription, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> to Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> of the Way of per|forming the Operation for the Extraction of the <HI>Stone</HI> out of the Bladder by Brother <HI>James,</HI> an Hermit in <HI>France,</HI> as I received it from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>He maketh u&s;e of a Steel <HI>Staff,</HI> much bigger and &s;horter than tho&s;e which are commonly made u&s;e of. It is &s;horter from the Top to the Bending of it, it bends more than ours; he hath but two, one for Men and another for Children.</P>
<P>His <HI>Conductor</HI> is &s;lender and longer than ours; the Point whereof, which goes into the Bladder, being of the Figure of a Lozenge, is wide and open in the Extremity.</P>
<P>His <HI>Forceps</HI> have longer Branches than ours; but the Holds of them are &s;horter and wider, with many large Teeth within.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eurethra</HI> with which he draweth the Sand or Gravel, which re|main &s;ometimes in the Bladder after the <HI>Stone</HI> is out, is &s;horter than ours.</P>
<P>His Knife is much longer and &s;lenderer than ours.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="26">
<P>He cau&s;eth the Patient to lie flat upon his Back, either upon his Bed or upon a Table, whereupon is a &s;oft Quilt, in &s;uch a manner, that the Fundament is three or four Fingers over the Table, &s;ome Servants &s;upporting his Legs and Thighs. He u&s;eth no Ligature to fa&s;ten the Patient, giving him more Liberty than we do; he cau&s;eth his Legs to be bent again&s;t the Thighs, but not the Thighs again&s;t the Belly, except the Left, which in his Operation he u&s;eth more or le&s;s, as he thinks fit.</P>
<P>Then he introduceth the <HI>Catheter</HI> or <HI>Staff</HI> into the Bladder; which, tho' bigger and &s;horter than ours, yet &s;eemeth to run in ea&s;ier. Very often he holdeth it him&s;elf with his Left Hand, pre&s;&s;ing it clo&s;e towards the Fundament, in order to dilate and extend the Membranes of the Bladder; then he feeleth with the Fingers of his Right Hand, to find cut the <HI>Staff</HI> through the Skin; &s;o having felt it, he runneth his Inci&s;ion Knife, at the Bent of the Left Thigh, upon the fat Protuberance be|low the <HI>I&s;chium</HI> Bone, directly upwards by the <HI>Rectum</HI> to the Blad|der, which he pierceth by its Neck, and &s;ometimes a little above it. When he cutteth, the cutting Parts of his Knife are turned upwards and downwards. Having thus pierced the Bladder, which he knoweth by the Urine running out, then he turneth his Knife, and thru&s;teth it a little further, in order to open the Bladder wide enough that his Finger may go in ea&s;ily; then he withdraweth his Knife, and enlargeth the Wound in the outward Parts, of the Length of two or three Inches; after which he thru&s;teth his Finger into the Bladder, in order to know more preci&s;ely the Bigne&s;s and Situation of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and make it loo&s;e, but chiefly to dilate the Overture of the Bladder, by tearing its Mem|branes.</P>
<P>Then he introduceth his <HI>Conductor</HI> into the Bladder, along this Finger which is in it.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Conductor</HI> is in the Bladder he taketh the <HI>Staff</HI> out, and in|troduceth the <HI>Forceps</HI> by the <HI>Conductor</HI> into it, with which he gets hold of the <HI>Stone</HI> and draweth it out.</P>
<P>If he finds any Difficulty, either in getting hold of the <HI>Stone,</HI> or in drawing it out, he u&s;eth all the Ways commonly u&s;ed, rai&s;ing the Left Thigh more or le&s;s, putting his Finger in the Fundament, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="21" REF="27">times the Bladder, in order to examine the Situation of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and loo&s;en it in ca&s;e there might be any Adhe&s;ion with the Membranes of the Bladder. Having found out, and removed the Cau&s;e of the Diffi|culty, he thru&s;teth the <HI>Forceps</HI> again into the Bladder, and gets hold of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and pulls it out.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that this &s;econd Time, nor any other, he u&s;eth no <HI>Conductor,</HI> the <HI>Forceps</HI> running in very ea&s;ily. He never thru&s;teth his Finger or any In&s;trument into the Bladder, without &s;teeping them in Oil of Ro&s;es. He never u&s;es any <HI>Dilatatorium</HI> or <HI>Canula,</HI> or Tents in the Wound, except &s;ome &s;mall Do&s;&s;ils in the Lips of the outward Wound, to keep them open for a little while. He u&s;eth no Ointments at all for the Wound, applying only a Pledget &s;teeped in Oil of Ro&s;es upon it; for he under&s;tands nothing at all of the Way of dre&s;&s;ing Wounds, nor in the Diet which the Patient is to ob&s;erve; which Things he doth not value. In this Way he operates as dexterou&s;ly as any of our be&s;t Operators. (19)</P>
<P>Wherein this Account of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation differs from the re&s;t; and al&s;o wherein they all differ from one another, we &s;hall be better able to &s;how, when we have gone through all that belongs to the Hi&s;tory of it.</P>
<P>The next Author, in order of Time, who has &s;aid any thing further about the Method of performing it, is <HI>Saviard;</HI> and he has only told us, that <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> who cut &s;everal Patients in the <HI>Hotel Dieu</HI> in the Year 1698, u&s;ed to leave a large ill-contriv'd <HI>Catheter</HI> in the Bladder ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l he had extracted the <HI>Stone.</HI> (20)</P>
<P><HI>Dionis,</HI> to whom we now return, begins his Account of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method, by ob&s;erving, that he took no Pains to prepare his Patients for the Operation, and cared not whether they had been blooded and purged before-hand or not. He places the Patient upon the Edge of a Table &s;et in a good Light, and then lays him upon his Back, with only a Pillow under his Head. He rai&s;es his Thighs, &s;eparates them wide from one another, bends his Legs &s;o that his Heels and Buttocks almo&s;t meet, and &s;ets two &s;trong Men to keep him in that Po&s;ture, without
<PB N="22" REF="28">binding him at all, but tru&s;ting entirely to the Strength and Manage|ment of the&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>The Patient being thus in a proper Situation, he introduces a greas'd <HI>Staff</HI> not groov'd, into the <HI>Penis,</HI> and holding it in his Left-hand, he thru&s;ts out that part of the Bladder where he de&s;igns to make his Inci&s;ion: Then taking in his Right a long <HI>Bi&s;toury</HI> &s;haped like a Dag|ger, he plunges it near the Point of the Left Buttock, two Fingers breadth from the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> and pu&s;hing it &s;treight towards the Blad|der, he cuts into the Body thereof as near the Neck as he can, making an Inci&s;ion as wide as the Size of the <HI>Stone</HI> requires it, before ever he takes out his <HI>Bi&s;toury.</HI></P>
<P>He makes u&s;e of a <HI>Conductor</HI> in order to direct the <HI>Forceps,</HI> which is made pretty much of the &s;ame Shape with ours; but very often before he introduces this In&s;trument, he thru&s;ts his Finger into the Wound to di&s;cover the Situation of the <HI>Stone.</HI> As &s;oon as he lays hold of it with the <HI>Forceps,</HI> he pulls it out &s;uddenly and roughly, never reflecting on the bad Con&s;equences that &s;uch Violence may be attended with. If there be more <HI>Stones</HI> than one, he extracts all of them after the &s;ame manner; and when he finds there are none left, he believes his whole Work to be done, for he never thinks of getting any <HI>Apparatus</HI> ready before-hand, nor of dre&s;&s;ing his Patients after the Operation. He u&s;es no A&s;tringents nor Defen&s;ives; all he does is to apply a little Oil and Wine to the Wound; and when he is put in mind of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is of the Patient's being well looked after, his An&s;wer is, I have extracted the <HI>Stone,</HI> I leave God to cure the Patient. (21)</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden,</HI> in order to explain <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> new-invented Way of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> thinks it &s;ufficient to tell us, that it was by the Direction of a <HI>Staff</HI> into the Bladder near the <HI>Rectum;</HI> and as he &s;up|po&s;es this to be the &s;ame with that practis'd afterwards in <HI>Holland</HI> by Mr. <HI>Rau,</HI> we may gather this further, that he thought the Inci&s;ion was made in the Bladder exactly betwixt the <HI>Ureters.</HI> (22)</P>
<P><HI>Albinus</HI> informs us, that the Parts propo&s;ed to be cut in <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation, were not the Neck of the Bladder, as had been anciently practis'd, nor the <HI>Urethra</HI> as was commonly done at that time; but the
<PB N="23" REF="29">Bladder it&s;elf on one Side, near the Neck, and a little towards the lower and back Part. In order to this the Patient was laid upon his Back, with his Knees erect, his Thighs bent, and kept at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from one another. The Inci&s;ion was begun on the Side of the <HI>Anus,</HI> and afterwards the Knife was thru&s;t obliquely inwards, and a little up|wards all the way to that Part of the Bladder already de&s;cribed; and la&s;tly, a Pair of <HI>Forceps</HI> introduced through the Wound to lay hold of and extract the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are all the Accounts that I can find ever to have been publi&s;h'd concerning <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method of Cutting upon the <HI>Staff;</HI> and I have placed them all together, <HI>Mery</HI>'s alone excepted, which came in more naturally before, that it may be ea&s;ier for the Reader to compare them with one another, or at lea&s;t to perceive the Truth and Exactne&s;s of the Compari&s;on I &s;hall lay before him in its proper Place.</P>
<P><HI>Frere Jacques</HI> was &s;ufficiently care&s;s'd at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> not to think of leaving it while the Court remained there; but I hear of no other Ope|rations he perform'd during his Stay. It had one good Effect however: By giving the News of his extraordinary Succe&s;s, and the kind Recep|ception he met with at Court, time to &s;pread over <HI>Paris;</HI> he found his Reputation as a Lithotomi&s;t much better e&s;tabli&s;hed upon his Return, than it could otherwi&s;e have been, tho' he had made a Thou&s;and Ex|periments before the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons of the Ho&s;pitals. The Approach of the Court to <HI>Paris</HI> contributed further to this; and there|fore no &s;ooner had the King left <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> to go to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> but <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> re&s;olved to try his Fortune once more at <HI>Paris;</HI> if that can be called a Tryal, in which he knew the Genius of his Nation too well, not to be &s;ure to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>He arrived there about the Beginning of <HI>April</HI> 1698, having been between Three and Four Months ab&s;ent. A very few Days after his Return, he cut a Woman nam'd <HI>de Lorrain,</HI> a Boy between Sixteen and Seventeen Years of Age, two Men and another Boy, and three more, at which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> was not pre&s;ent, The Days of the Month in which all the&s;e Operations were perform'd are not &s;et down; but they mu&s;t all have follow'd very clo&s;e upon one another, for before the End of <HI>April</HI> he had made a Journey to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> cut four People in an Ho|&s;pital there, was return'd to <HI>Paris,</HI> and had cut in the Ho&s;pitals of that
<PB N="24" REF="30">City, having obtained what he &s;o much de&s;ired, Leave &s;o to do, in the manner we &s;hall pre&s;ently relate.</P>
<P>Concerning the Fate of the&s;e Twelve Patients, for I do not find that he cut any more, tho' it is very probable he did, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> informs us, that one of the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> died two Days after the Opera|tion, another in three Days, another in the Month of <HI>September</HI> follow|ing, having never been cured; the re&s;t lived, but in &s;uch a manner as did this new Method no great Honour, as we &s;hall hear in the proper Place. <HI>Mery</HI> &s;ays nothing of his Journey to <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> but <HI>Dionis</HI> who mentions it owns, that all the Patients he cut there recovered in &s;ome &s;ort or other. (23)</P>
<P>One of the Three la&s;t of the <HI>Paris</HI> Patients he cut upon the <HI>Gripe.</HI> This is the fir&s;t time we hear of his Cutting for the <HI>Stone</HI> in that man|ner; and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has given us the following Account of his Method. He introduces the Fore and Middle Fingers of his Left Hand through the <HI>Anus</HI> into the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum;</HI> and pre&s;&s;ing upon the Bladder behind with his two Fingers, and before with his Right Hand upon the Belly, he thru&s;ts the <HI>Stone</HI> towards the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> and keeps it there by means of the two Fingers which he holds firmly behind it. In his Right Hand he takes his <HI>Bi&s;toury,</HI> and beginning at the Pro|tuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> he cuts all the Parts that lie between that and the <HI>Stone.</HI> So that his two Ways of Operating differ, not in the Cour&s;e of the Inci&s;ion, but only in the In&s;truments he u&s;es, and the Manner of extracting the <HI>Stone;</HI> for whereas in the great <HI>Apparatus</HI> he cuts upon a <HI>Staff,</HI> and u&s;es <HI>Forceps</HI> to draw out the <HI>Stone,</HI> in this he cuts upon the <HI>Stone</HI> it&s;elf, and takes it out by means of a <HI>Curete</HI> of about an Inch in breadth. Fir&s;t of all he dilates the Bottom of the Wound, by thru&s;t|ing his <HI>Conductor</HI> into the Bladder; then forces in his <HI>Curete</HI> between the <HI>Stone</HI> and the upper internal Surface of the Bladder; and having got it behind the <HI>Stone,</HI> he rai&s;es the Handle of it with his Right Hand, the two Fingers of his Left remaining &s;till in their former Place; and thus, in the &s;ame manner as a Weight is rai&s;ed, or any other Ob&s;tacle re|moved by a Lever, he forces out the <HI>Stone.</HI> (24)</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s Corre&s;pondent has likewi&s;e taken Notice of this Me|thod of Operating. Brother <HI>James,</HI> he &s;ays, very often cutteth the Pa|tient upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as was u&s;ed formerly,
<PB N="25" REF="31">except that he maketh the Inci&s;ion in the &s;ame Place as for the for|mer; this Way he liketh better than the other, and it &s;eemeth, to be more favoured by him, and indeed it is &s;urer, tho' the pre&s;&s;ing upon the Belly which he doth, is a very bad Method. (25)</P>
<P>Neither <HI>Dionis,</HI> nor any of the re&s;t of our Authors, have &s;o much as mention'd this &s;econd Way of Cutting. The Succe&s;s that attended it we &s;hall &s;ee as we go along.</P>
<P>We are now come to that Period of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Tran&s;actions at <HI>Paris;</HI> in which, as his Wi&s;hes &s;eem'd to be entirely crown'd, &s;o a &s;peedy Foundation was laid for the Ruin of that Reputation which he had &s;o unaccountably acquired. The Operations which he had perform'd immediately upon his Return from <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, as that but Two Patients died out of Twelve that we know he cut. This, joined to the favourable Character that &s;ome Phy&s;icians from the Pro|vinces gave of him at Court, and the great Merit that was made there of what had already happen'd to him at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> made the Magi|&s;trates of <HI>Paris</HI> (not the King, as far as we can learn either from <HI>Mery</HI> or <HI>Dionis,</HI> 26) begin to think &s;eriou&s;ly of allowing him to Cut in the two great Ho&s;pitals of that City. In order to that, however, the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident thought it proper to call together the Admini&s;trators of the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons belonging to it, and al&s;o Me&s;|ieurs <HI>Mery</HI> and <HI>Be&s;&s;iere</HI> who had before been commi&s;&s;ion'd by him to in&s;pect <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Experiments on dead Bodies, to hear their Senti|ments upon a Matter wherein the Lives of the Sick People in that Ho|&s;pital were &s;o nearly concern'd. The A&s;&s;embly was held in the Arch|bi&s;hop's Palace on the 24th Day of <HI>April,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> was de|&s;ired to give his Opinion the fir&s;t. He has &s;et down at length the Di&s;cour&s;e he made upon that Occa&s;ion; in which he endeavours to oppo&s;e the Monk's being allow'd to Cut, as &s;trenuou&s;ly as he had in his former Report recommended him.</P>
<P>None of the other Phy&s;icians nor Surgeons pretended to di&s;pute ei|ther the Facts alledg'd by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> or the Con&s;equences he drew from them; but they thought, that con&s;idering the great Num|ber of &s;ucce&s;sful Operations which he had perform'd in the Provinces, as they were inform'd by the Phy&s;icians there re&s;iding, it would be hard to condemn his new Method altogether, upon account of a few unlucky
<PB N="26" REF="32">Experiments he had made of it at <HI>Paris,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince the Publick was &s;o much prejudiced in his Favour; and therefore they gave it as their Opinion, that the &s;ure&s;t Way was to admit him to make new Tryals, which he could by no other means do &s;o well, as by being allowed to Cut in the <HI>Hotel Dieu;</HI> and this was accordingly re&s;olv'd on. (27)</P>
<P>He was at the &s;ame time admitted to the <HI>Charit&eacute;;</HI> and in the&s;e two Ho&s;pitals he Cut Sixty Patients, Forty two in the fir&s;t, and Eighteen in the &s;econd, during the Space of one Sea&s;on; that is, at farthe&s;t be|tween the 24th of <HI>April</HI> and the Beginning of <HI>July;</HI> for by the 8th Day of that Month, he had left <HI>Paris,</HI> reached <HI>Orleans,</HI> (which is 100 Miles di&s;tant from it) and there perform'd an Operation.</P>
<P>The Crowds to &s;ee him Cut were inconceivable; there was not a Phy&s;ician nor Surgeon who did not &s;trive to get in, in&s;omuch, that they were forced to have Guards to keep off the Pre&s;s; and there have been Two Hundred Per&s;ons pre&s;ent at once at his Operations.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Sixty Patients <HI>Dionis</HI> tells us more died than lived, and at the Time he wrote that may be true; but by a Computation which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> made of the different Fate of them, about <HI>Sep|tember</HI> following, as near as I can gue&s;s, &s;ince no Part of his Relation appears to have been written after that Time; and it is certain it did not exceed a full Year, becau&s;e towards the latter End of it he calls the Time in which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Cut in the Ho&s;pitals the la&s;t Spring: By this Computation, I &s;ay, it appears that Twenty Five died &s;oon after the Operation; Thirteen went from the Ho&s;pitals perfectly cured, as was thought, tho' afterwards he was inform'd that &s;ome of their Wounds had broke out afre&s;h; and Twenty Five remain'd in the Ho|&s;pitals, &s;ome afflicted with Incontinence of Urine, others with Fi&s;tulas, and all of them &s;o very low, that according to the Information he had received from the Officers and Servants of the Ho&s;pitals, there was on the 30th of <HI>July</HI> very little Hopes of their Recovery. On this Day, our Author &s;ays, he ended his Ob&s;ervations; but as in other Places of his Book he mentions Facts which did not happen till <HI>September,</HI> it is plain they were retouched after that Time. (28)</P>
<PB N="27" REF="33">
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> was at Pains to examine the Bodies of &s;uch as died after <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations with a great deal of Care, and he has &s;et down the Ob&s;ervations he made upon them: By the&s;e we may with great Certainty judge of the Merit of the&s;e Methods of Cutting for the <HI>Stone;</HI> but before we can proceed to that, &s;ome few Facts more, belong|ing to the Hi&s;tory of them, mu&s;t fir&s;t be related.</P>
<P>It is not mentioned, neither by <HI>Mery</HI> nor <HI>Dionis,</HI> how many died out of each Ho&s;pital; but it is probable that the Number was greater in Pro|portion to tho&s;e he Cut in the <HI>Charit&eacute;</HI> than in the <HI>Hotel Dieu. Dionis</HI> &s;ays, that Seven died there in one Day; and from thence, and from a Quarrel which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> is &s;aid to have had with &s;ome of the Monks of that Hou&s;e, it was, that he and his Friends took occa&s;ion to trump up a fictitious Story, that the Monks &s;ometimes poi&s;on'd his Patients, and &s;ometimes cut other Parts in dre&s;&s;ing their Wounds, than tho&s;e which he had touched, in order to di&s;credit his Operation. This Story, how unlikely &s;o ever, gained the Belief of great Numbers of People, and the Death of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Patients turned as much to his Honour, as his having &s;aved the Lives of the re&s;t; but at length, when upon Di&s;|&s;ection of the dead Bodies, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who had been Cut at the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> in which there was no Su&s;picion or any Fraud, the Ignorance of the Operator, and the Inconveniencies of the Operations, came to be plainly di&s;covered, this Accu&s;ation vani&s;hed into Smoak; and with it the Reputation of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> and his Intere&s;t at <HI>Paris,</HI> which he had rea&s;on to think &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;o that it was &s;oon afterwards re|&s;olved that he &s;hould be no more allowed to Cut in either of the Ho&s;pi|tals. (29)</P>
<P>What contributed very much to this &s;udden Di&s;grace of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> was the Death of the Mare&s;chal <HI>de l'Orge,</HI> which happened in the mo&s;t cruel and lamentable Manner, the very next Day after he had been Cut by him; while at the &s;ame time Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fagon,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding all the Sollicitations that were made to him, to put him&s;elf in the Hands of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> re&s;olved rather to tru&s;t the Art of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mare&s;chal,</HI> a skilful and regularly bred Surgeon, recovered perfectly af|ter undergoing the &s;ame Operation. (30)</P>
<P><HI>Frere Jacques</HI> finding his Credit quite &s;unk at <HI>Paris,</HI> and that there was no Hopes left of getting any more Employment there, thought his
<PB N="28" REF="34">be&s;t Way was to withdraw to &s;ome other City in <HI>France;</HI> and <HI>Orleans</HI> was the Place he pitched upon. There, between the 8th and 15th Day of <HI>July,</HI> he perform'd Eight Operations, Five in the Publick Ho&s;pital of that City, and Three el&s;ewhere; as we are inform'd by a Letter which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Noel,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Orleans,</HI> wrote to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 13. 1698. The Succe&s;s of the&s;e Operations was every bit as bad as tho&s;e he performed in the Ho&s;pitals of <HI>Paris.</HI> Three of the Eight Patients died within a few Days after the Operation; a Fourth before <HI>September,</HI> that is, in le&s;s than two Months after he was Cut; One reco|vered perfectly; and the other Three continued in a langui&s;hing State, being either troubled with an Incontinence of Urine, or very gro&s;s Symptoms of a Fi&s;tula. (31)</P>
<P><HI>Dionis</HI> &s;ays, he Cut afterwards at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and in other Cities in <HI>France;</HI> but he mu&s;t certainly be mi&s;taken, &s;ince by an Adverti&s;ement in the <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Gazette, dated the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> it appears, that on the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> that is (allowing for the Difference of the Stile) only 23 Days after his la&s;t Operation at <HI>Orleans,</HI> he arrived at <HI>Aix la Cha|pelle.</HI> The Sub&s;tance of that Adverti&s;ement is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> Operator for the <HI>Stone</HI> to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, arrived at <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> on the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> to Cut a Man for the <HI>Stone;</HI> and he hereby gives Notice, that whoever are afflicted with that Di&s;temper, the <HI>Gravel,</HI> or any kind of <HI>Hernia</HI> or <HI>Rupture,</HI> he will undertake to cure for nothing, the Rich as well as the Poor, only out of Charity and Benevolence to Mankind. He offers to all Surgeons to teach them his Way of Cutting, and all his other Ope|rations <HI>gratis;</HI> and to all Phy&s;icians, to &s;how them infallible Reme|dies again&s;t the <HI>Gravel.</HI> He lodges at Mon&s;ieur <HI>Blondel's</HI> a Phy&s;ician. His Operations are all New, and of his own Invention. That for the <HI>Stone</HI> in particular never endangers Life, and no Fi&s;tula is to be feared after it. He has perform'd it on Multitudes at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> in Pre&s;ence of the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and met with an univer&s;al Approbation." (32)</Q></P>
<P>The Stile of this Adverti&s;ement &s;hows, that it was publi&s;hed by the Monk's own Order; and from it, as well as &s;everal other Particulars of his Hi&s;tory, it appears &s;ufficiently that he mu&s;t have been a mo&s;t pro|fligate abandon'd Wretch; and that under an outward Air of Simpli|city
<PB N="29" REF="35">and Self-denial, he concealed &s;ome &s;ecret De&s;ign or other, which perhaps the Multitudes of Per&s;ons that died under his Hands prevent|ed his ever putting in Execution.</P>
<P>He gives him&s;elf out here not only for an Operator for the <HI>Stone,</HI> but a Curer of <HI>Ruptures.</HI> He had made &s;ome Experiments of his Talents that Way in <HI>Paris,</HI> and more at <HI>Orleans:</HI> His Patients all of them recovered after the Operation, at lea&s;t we hear of none that died; but as it was always accompanied with Ca&s;tration, it &s;oon met with a general Di&s;gu&s;t, and therefore he laid it a&s;ide during all the re&s;t of the Time he remained at <HI>Paris.</HI> (33)</P>
<P>What Reception he found at <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> I have not as yet learned, nor whither he went from thence. It is certain he was afterwards in <HI>Holland,</HI> and Cut for the <HI>Stone</HI> there; as we learn from <HI>Albinus</HI> in the following Words, <Q>"While <HI>Rau</HI> taught Anatomy and practis'd Surgery at <HI>Am&s;terdam, Frere Jacques</HI> arrived there to practi&s;e his new Method of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> as he had already done in <HI>France.</HI> For this purpo&s;e he obtained a Permi&s;&s;ion from the Civil Magi&s;trate; and <HI>Rau</HI> was frequently pre&s;ent at his Operations, which he highly blamed and condemn'd. This Freedom of his gave &s;ome Umbrage at fir&s;t, and he found him&s;elf obliged to hold his Tongue; but afterwards, when they &s;aw that all he had &s;aid was confirmed by the Event, <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Permi&s;&s;ion was taken from him, and <HI>Rau</HI> made Publick Lithotomi&s;t in his Room."</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> A Compari&s;on of the &s;everal De&s;criptions that have been given of <HI>Frere Jaques</HI> Methods of Cutting Males.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing Hi&s;tory I have collected all that I can find in Au|thors concerning the two Methods u&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> in Cutting Men; but as the&s;e Accounts are not only &s;ome of them more full and compleat than others, but likewi&s;e differ from one another in &s;everal Particulars, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to compare them together; it being impo&s;&s;ible to judge as we ought concerning the true Merit of an Operation, except we be fir&s;t throughly acquainted with the true Man|ner of performing it.</P>
<P>To begin therefore by the Preparation of the Patient, the fir&s;t Step towards all Operations of this kind; <HI>Dionis,</HI> the only Author who has &s;aid any thing about it, a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> looked upon Blooding, Purging, and every thing el&s;e that goes under that Name, as Things indifferent and of no Con&s;equence to the Succe&s;s of the Operation; and indeed this agrees &s;o well with the Character we have given of him, and e&s;pecially the &s;hort Stay he u&s;ually made in the Places where he Cut, that there can be no room to doubt of the Truth of it.</P>
<P>The In&s;truments he made U&s;e of were fir&s;t a <HI>Catheter</HI> or <HI>Staff.</HI> In de&s;cribing this, all our Authors agree well enough; and from what they have &s;aid, we may conclude that it was made of Steel, &s;olid, round, without a Groove, thicker and &s;horter than tho&s;e u&s;ed in the common
<PB N="31" REF="37">Way, &s;horter from the Top to the Bending, and bent more; that he had two &s;orts, one for Men, and one for Children, differing only in Size; and that before he u&s;ed it, he always dip'd it in Oil of Ro&s;es, or &s;ome &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>His Inci&s;ion Knife, or <HI>Bi&s;toury,</HI> as it is call'd in <HI>French,</HI> differ'd from the common one chiefly in Length. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> adds, that it was &s;lenderer; and <HI>Dionis,</HI> that it was &s;haped like a Poinard or Dagger.</P>
<P><HI>Mery</HI> has given us a Figure of his <HI>Dilator</HI> or <HI>Conductor,</HI> by which it will be better under&s;tood than by any De&s;cription that has been made of it. <HI>Dionis</HI> &s;ays in general, that it is pretty much of the &s;ame Shape with the common one, which I believe is pretty far from being true. But Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s De&s;cription will agree very well with <HI>Mery</HI>'s Figure. His <HI>Conductor,</HI> &s;ays he, is &s;lender; and longer than the common one; the Point whereof, that is all that Part which goes into the Bladder, being of the Figure of a Lozenge, is wide and open in the Extremity.</P>
<P>His <HI>Forceps</HI> no Author has de&s;cribed except Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere,</HI> that is, they all believed it to be like the common one; but he tells us, that the Branches are longer, and the Holds &s;horter and wider, with many large Teeth within. It is for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that they &s;ay nothing of his Scoop; but Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> takes Notice, that that In&s;trument, which he calls an <HI>Eurethra,</HI> is &s;horter than the common &s;ort.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Patient, Number and Office of the A&s;&s;i&s;tants, follow next in Order. About all the&s;e Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> is entirely &s;ilent; <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere, Dionis</HI> and <HI>Albinus</HI> agree, except in a very few Particulars. The Patient is laid upon his Back on a Bed or Table, with a &s;oft Quilt un|der him, or only a Pillow under his Head, in &s;uch a manner that the Fundament is Three or Four Inches over the Edge of the Table, the Thighs erect, not bent towards the Belly, and at a good Di&s;tance from one another; (<HI>Albinus</HI> &s;ays they are bent, and not much &s;eparated;) the Legs bent &s;o as that the Heels do almo&s;t touch the Buttock; and in this Po&s;ture he is kept by two &s;trong A&s;&s;i&s;tants, without the help of any Ligature, &s;o that the Operator is at Liberty to move any Part, as he thinks convenient.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="38">
<P>The Patient being placed in this manner, <HI>Mery</HI> tells us that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> introduceth his <HI>Catheter</HI> into the Bladder; and <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> adds, that tho' it be bigger and &s;horter than the common ones, yet it &s;eems to run in ea&s;ier; that he very often (<HI>Dionis</HI> &s;ays always) holds it in his Left Hand, and pre&s;&s;es it clo&s;e towards the Fundament, in order to dilate or thru&s;t out that Part of the Bladder which he de&s;igns to Cut, till he can feel it with his Fingers through the Skin. <HI>Albinus</HI> &s;eems to think that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> made U&s;e of no <HI>Staff</HI> in his Operation; for be&s;ides, that he does not mention it in the Account he has given us, he makes the Addition <HI>Rau</HI> made to <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation to con&s;i&s;t in a <HI>Staff,</HI> which he compares not with the <HI>Staff</HI> u&s;ed by him, as he natu|rally ought to have done, in order to &s;how wherein <HI>Rau</HI>'s Was prefera|ble to his, but with that u&s;ed in the great <HI>Apparatus.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> had felt the <HI>Catheter</HI> through the Skin, he began to make an Inci&s;ion on the Left and In&s;ide of the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> and &s;o cutting on obliquely from below upwards, he divided whatever came in his Way till he reached his <HI>Catheter;</HI> and it appears by all <HI>Mery</HI>'s Di&s;&s;ections, from whom the&s;e Words are taken, that his De&s;ign was to cut the Neck of the Bladder length-ways, and as much of the Body of it as the Size of the <HI>Stone</HI> required.</P>
<P><HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> de&s;cribes his Inci&s;ion thus: He runneth his Knife at the Bent of the Left Thigh, upon the fat Protuberance, below the <HI>I&s;chium</HI> Bone, directly upwards by the <HI>Rectum</HI> into the Bladder, which he pierceth by its Neck, and &s;ometimes a little above it. This Account di&s;agrees with the former, chiefly in the Cour&s;e of the Inci&s;ion from its Beginning till it reached the Bladder.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Dionis,</HI> the Knife was plunged near the Point of the Left Buttock two Fingers breadth from the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> and from thence pu&s;hed directly forwards into the Body of the Bladder, as near the Neck as he could, and all this before ever he took out his Knife. Here the Neck of the Bladder is &s;uppo&s;ed to remain entire, which is contrary to both <HI>Mery</HI> and <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI>'s Account of his Way of Cutting, that it was by the Direction of a <HI>Staff</HI> into the Bladder near the <HI>Rectum,</HI> may
<PB N="33" REF="39">be either true or fal&s;e, ju&s;t as he under&s;tood it; but the &s;econd Part, that the Bladder was cut exactly betwixt the <HI>Ureters,</HI> can never be true. This &s;hall be &s;hown in de&s;cribing the Structure of the Parts concerned in this Operation.</P>
<P><HI>Albinus</HI> has copied <HI>Dionis</HI>'s Mi&s;take about the Neck of the Bladder not being cut; but what he &s;ays further, that the Inci&s;ion was begun on the Side of the <HI>Anus,</HI> and afterwards the Knife thru&s;t obliquely in|wards and a little upwards into the Side of the Bladder near its Neck, and a little towards the lower and back Part; is exactly agreeable to what we have heard from <HI>Mery.</HI></P>
<P>This being the Part of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method, which is of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to be rightly under&s;tood, I thought it proper to bring here under one View all that has been &s;aid about it.</P>
<P>The Inci&s;ion being made, Mr. <HI>Mery</HI> acquaints us further, that he thru&s;t his Finger through the Wound into the Bladder, to find out the <HI>Stone;</HI> and having ob&s;erved where it lay, he introduced his <HI>Conductor</HI> to dilate the Wound, if the Bigne&s;s of the <HI>Stone</HI> required it, and al&s;o that it might direct his <HI>Forceps</HI> into the Bladder. As &s;oon as the <HI>Forceps</HI> had entered there, he drew out his <HI>Conductor,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Staff</HI> out of the <HI>Urethra;</HI> then having felt for and laid hold of the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>For|ceps,</HI> he extracted both of them together.</P>
<P><HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s Account of this Part of the Operation di&s;agrees with <HI>Mery</HI>'s chiefly in this, that he &s;uppo&s;es the Wound to be dilated by the Knife and Finger only, not by the <HI>Conductor;</HI> that he makes him enlarge the outward Part of it Two or Three Inches after the fir&s;t Inci&s;ion is fi|ni&s;hed; and that the <HI>Staff</HI> is taken out before the <HI>Forceps</HI> is introduced. He has likewi&s;e made this very con&s;iderable Addition to Mr. <HI>Mery</HI>'s Relation, that when the Monk found any Difficulty, either in getting hold of the <HI>Stone,</HI> or in drawing it out, he u&s;ed all the Ways commonly practis'd, rai&s;ing the Left Thigh more or le&s;s, putting his Finger in the Fundament, and &s;ometimes into the Bladder, in order to examine the Situation of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and loo&s;en it in ca&s;e there might be any Ad|he&s;ion with the Membranes of the Bladder. Having found out and removed the Cau&s;e of the Difficulty, he thru&s;ts the <HI>Forceps</HI> again into
<PB N="34" REF="40">the Bladder, gets hold of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and pulls it out; and at this time he u&s;ed no <HI>Conductor,</HI> the <HI>Forceps</HI> running in very ea&s;ily.</P>
<P><HI>Saviard</HI> makes the <HI>Staff</HI> remain in the Bladder till the <HI>Stone</HI> is ex|tracted. This I take to be a Mi&s;take, becau&s;e it not only contradicts the two former Accounts, but becau&s;e by this means it mu&s;t have been more difficult to &s;earch for, and lay hold of the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>Forceps.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dionis</HI> agrees with <HI>Mery</HI> in the few Things he has &s;aid, without ha|ving made any material Addition; and <HI>Albinus</HI> has mentioned the Ex|traction of the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>Forceps</HI> in very general Terms.</P>
<P>As for the Care of the Patient after the Operation, and the Dre&s;&s;ing of the Wound, both <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> and <HI>Dionis</HI> inform us, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> neglected that almo&s;t entirely, or at lea&s;t left it to other People; and among&s;t all the Operations that he perform'd in the Ho&s;pitals of <HI>Paris,</HI> I cannot learn from <HI>Mery</HI> that ever he applied the lea&s;t Thing to any Patient whatever.</P>
<P>In the Compari&s;on which I have here made of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> fir&s;t Method of Cutting, I have taken care to point out the Mi&s;takes of the &s;everal Accounts we have of it, as far I could with any Cer|tainty conclude there were any to be found. As for the other Particu|lars in which they di&s;agree, and about which I have not ventured to determine any Thing, it may very well be &s;uppo&s;ed that they have all of them a real Foundation; &s;ince it is more than probable, that at dif|ferent Times, and on different Subjects, the Monk may have operated different Ways.</P>
<P>There is no room for &s;uch a Compari&s;on of his Method of Cutting upon the <HI>Gripe;</HI> for be&s;ides, that the only thing in which it differs from the Old Operation that goes under that Name, was in the Place where the Inci&s;ion was begun, we have no particular Account of it but from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> and that has been already &s;et down.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Judgments concerning <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Me|thod of Cutting Males.</HEAD>
<P>HAving now fini&s;hed the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations for the <HI>Stone,</HI> and compar'd all the Parts of his Method of Cutting, as far as there is any thing to be met with in Authors about it; we are fully in a Condition to under&s;tand the Judgments that the &s;ame Au|thors have made concerning the Advantages and Inconveniencies that mu&s;t attend it; together with the Rea&s;ons upon which their &s;everal Deci&s;ions have been founded.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere,</HI> as has been already &s;aid, was the fir&s;t who ven|tured to publi&s;h his Thoughts about the&s;e Operations, fir&s;t in the Name of his Corre&s;pondent, and then in his own.</P>
<P>His Friend's Opinion is, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Way of Cutting is not &s;o &s;ure as the ancient Way, by which he means that of <HI>Marianus;</HI> and that for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the Point of the Knife not being directed by the <HI>Staff,</HI> he is always in danger of piercing all the Mem|branes of the Bladder through and through; and, Secondly, Becau&s;e the Place whereupon he maketh the Inci&s;ion being full of con&s;iderable Ve&s;&s;els, one can hardly avoid Cutting of &s;ome of them; and accord|ingly it was ob&s;erved in almo&s;t all that died in his Hands, that there was a great deal of Blood in the Bladder, and in &s;ome in the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen.</HI></P>
<PB N="36" REF="42">
<P>The Author goes on to illu&s;trate the&s;e two Rea&s;ons in this Manner: He &s;ucceedeth better when the <HI>Stone</HI> is big and large than when it is &s;mall, by rea&s;on that a big <HI>Stone</HI> not only extendeth the Bladder, but it &s;toppeth the Point of the Knife. He did refu&s;e to Cut One, in who&s;e Bladder there was but a &s;mall <HI>Stone;</HI> which confirmeth me in the Opi|nion, that the Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of his Operations proceedeth from the Point of his Knife not being &s;topt neither by the <HI>Staff</HI> nor <HI>Stone;</HI> for when there is but a &s;mall <HI>Stone,</HI> the Bladder being empty, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cut the whole Bladder throughly, and con&s;equently cut &s;ome of its own Ve&s;&s;els, which cau&s;eth the <HI>Hemorrhage,</HI> which is the better voided when the <HI>Stone</HI> is large.</P>
<P>Thus far Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s Friend; and what he adds as his own Opinion is not much different, except in the Experiments he has made to prove how rea&s;onable it is. I cannot approve the Hermit's Way, &s;ays he, on all Occa&s;ions; yet I think it might be &s;ucce&s;sfully improved (by which he can mean no more than that it might be u&s;ed) in &s;ome particular Ca&s;es. What the&s;e Ca&s;es are, will appear by the Ob&s;ervations he made about it, after he had received his Friend's Account.</P>
<P>I took a Body, continues he, in the Bladder of which I put a <HI>Stone;</HI> the <HI>Staff</HI> being in the Bladder, I did pre&s;s it downwards hard enough as to be felt through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ments, and made the Inci&s;ion upon it in the Bent of the Thigh, in order to know whether it would not be a &s;urer Way by &s;ecuring the Point of the Knife; by that Way I got my <HI>Conductor</HI> and <HI>Forceps</HI> into the Bladder, and drew the <HI>Stone</HI> very ea&s;ily; but afterwards, by the Di&s;&s;ection of the Body, I found that the Artery of the <HI>Penis</HI> and the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> were cut through and through; which cannot be avoided, becau&s;e the Artery and <HI>Ve&s;iculae</HI> lie imme|diately under that Part of the Bladder which the <HI>Staff</HI> pre&s;&s;eth upon.</P>
<P>I took another Body, and having put in the Bladder a &s;mall Stone, I made the Inci&s;ion much lower, and pierced the Bladder under the <HI>Staff,</HI> by which Inci&s;ion I drew the <HI>Stone;</HI> then di&s;&s;ecting the Body I found the Bladder cut through and its Arteries, which can hardly be avoided, the Bladder being then &s;o much contracted, that both Sides of the Bladder are cut, before the Operator either feels the <HI>Stone,</HI> or &s;ees any Urine running out.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="43">
<P>I took a third Body, in the Bladder of which I put a very large <HI>Stone;</HI> the <HI>Staff</HI> being in it, I made the Inci&s;ion upon the fat Protube|rancy under the <HI>I&s;chium</HI> Bone; and piercing the Bladder below the <HI>Staff,</HI> I found immediately the <HI>Stone</HI> with the Point of the Knife, with which I cut the Bladder the Length of an Inch; through which having intro|duced the <HI>Conductor,</HI> and then the <HI>Forceps,</HI> I got hold of the <HI>Stone,</HI> and drew it out very ea&s;ily. Then I did di&s;&s;ect the Body, and found that neither the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> nor any Artery had been cut, by rea&s;on that the Weight of the Stone pre&s;&s;ed the Bottom of the Bladder lower than the <HI>Ve&s;iculae</HI> and Arteries.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s two fir&s;t Experiments, we &s;ee, confirm his Friend's two Rea&s;ons again&s;t this Method; and the third &s;erves for a Foundation for his own Opinion in favour of it in &s;ome particular Ca&s;es; that is, he thinks that this Way might be made u&s;e of when the <HI>Stone</HI> is very big, and willingly I would prefer it, &s;ays he, to the old Way; for by this Way we avoid that extraordinary and violent Dilatation of the Neck of the Bladder, which the <HI>Stone</HI> cau&s;eth when it is very big, and which is the Cau&s;e of the Inflammation and Mortification of the Bladder that killeth the Patient. But when the <HI>Stone</HI> is very &s;mall, or but of an in|different Bigne&s;s, the old Way is ea&s;ier and &s;urer.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> has given us his Judgment of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method of Cutting on the <HI>Gripe</HI> likewi&s;e: I cannot approve, &s;ays he, the Cut|ting upon the <HI>Gripe;</HI> becau&s;e, in that Way one cutteth through the <HI>Pro&s;tates,</HI> which de&s;troys the Parts of Generation. I have ob&s;erv'd, that all tho&s;e who have been Cut by that Method, were never fit for Genera|tion.(35)</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> was at <HI>Paris</HI> when <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> was there, and &s;aw him frequently Cut. The principal Thing to be remarked in what he has &s;aid about his Method, is the favourable Judgment he makes of it; and therefore I have cho&s;en to in&s;ert the whole Pa&s;&s;age in this Place.</P>
<P>Another popular Di&s;ea&s;e at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, is the <HI>Stone,</HI> and there are Men well practis'd in the Cutting for it. There are al&s;o two
<PB N="38" REF="44">Ho&s;pitals where great Numbers are cut Yearly, <HI>La Charit&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Hotel Dieu;</HI> but that which I &s;hall here mo&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon is the New Way practis'd by <HI>Pere Jacques,</HI> a Monk. About the 20th of <HI>April</HI> he Cut in the <HI>Hotel Dieu</HI> Ten in le&s;s than an Hour's time; the third Day after, all were hearty and without Pain but One.</P>
<P>He Cuts both by the Great and Little <HI>Appareil;</HI> in both he boldly thru&s;ts in a broad Launcet or Stilleto into the middle of the Mu&s;cles of the Thigh near the <HI>Anus,</HI> till he joins the <HI>Catheter</HI> or <HI>Staff,</HI> or the <HI>Stone</HI> betwixt his Fingers; then he widens the Inci&s;ion of the Bladder, in Proportion to the <HI>Stone,</HI> with a Silver Oval Hoop; it that will not do, he thru&s;ts in his Four Fingers and tears it wider, then with the <HI>Ducks Bill</HI> he draws it out.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him cut a &s;econd time in the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> and he perform'd it upon Nine Per&s;ons in Three Quarters of an Hour very dextrou&s;ly. He &s;eemed to venture at all, and put me into &s;ome Di&s;order with the Cruel|ty of the Operation, and a &s;touter <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> than my &s;elf; however, I vi&s;ited them all in their Beds, and found them more amaz'd than in Pain.</P>
<P><HI>Pere Jacques</HI> cut al&s;o his Way in the other Ho&s;pital <HI>La Charit&eacute;,</HI> much about the &s;ame time, Eleven at twice. Here Mon&s;ieur <HI>Marechal,</HI> the be&s;t of the Surgeons now in <HI>Paris</HI> for this Operation, harangued again&s;t him before the Governours; who coldly an&s;wered, they would be de|termined by the Event which Way was be&s;t.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e Cut at <HI>La Charit&eacute;,</HI> One died; and being di&s;&s;ected, it was found he had his Bladder pierced in four or five Places, al&s;o the <HI>Mu&s;|culus P&s;oas</HI> &s;adly mangled, al&s;o the Left <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales</HI> cut. Notwith|&s;tanding this, if this Method was well executed by a skilful Hand, it might be of good U&s;e to Mankind.</P>
<P>Since my Return I had a Letter from Mr. <HI>Probie,</HI> a very learned and indu&s;trious young Gentleman, who was with me to &s;ee the Operation; that Part relating to this Matter I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe. Indeed, I
<PB N="39" REF="45">mightily long'd for an Account of this Matter, the Succe&s;s of which I came away too &s;oon to learn any thing for certain.</P>

<P><Q>"<HI>PEre Jacques</HI> Reputation mightily &s;lackens; out of Forty Five that he Cut at the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> but Sixteen of them &s;urvive; and of Nineteen in the <HI>Charit&eacute;,</HI> but Eleven.

The Per&s;on that died was &s;o di|&s;temper'd, that he was not expected to live; and it was thought if he had not been Cut, he had not lived &s;o long. The Surgeons have a great mind to cry down the Man, tho' they practi&s;e his Method; for <HI>Marechal</HI> has &s;ince Cut after <HI>Pere Jacques</HI> Manner, only with this Difference, that <HI>Marechal</HI>'s <HI>Catheter</HI> was canulated. <HI>La Rue,</HI> the Se|cond Surgeon of the <HI>Charit&eacute;</HI> Ho&s;pital, Cut after the Old Manner, at the &s;ame time when <HI>Marechal</HI> Cut <HI>Pere Jacques</HI> Way, but had not &s;o good Succe&s;s as <HI>Marechal</HI> had; for all that <HI>Marechal</HI> Cut are alive and well, whereas the other lo&s;t One or Two of his Number; be&s;ides, tho&s;e that lived were not &s;o &s;oon cured, no not by a Month or Six Weeks."</Q> Thus far Mr. <HI>Probie.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>I now go on to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery;</HI> and in relating the many Ob&s;erva|tions he has given us concerning <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations, I &s;hall ob&s;erve this Order; fir&s;t, to &s;et down the Ob&s;ervations them&s;elves in the &s;ame Order of Time in which they were made; and Secondly, Make a me|thodical Extract of the Rea&s;onings and Conclu&s;ions he draws from them.</P>
<P>What the fir&s;t Experiments made by <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> furni&s;hed him with upon both the&s;e Heads, has been already taken Notice of. Upon di&s;&s;ecting the Body of the Boy on which the &s;econd Tryal was made, our Author ob&s;erved, that the Monk had cut the <HI>Accelerator Mu&s;cle,</HI> which remained untouched in the former; and that the Beginning of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> the Neck, and that Part of the Body of the Bladder which lies near the back Part of the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> were &s;o much torn as to be al|mo&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="46">entirely &s;eparated from the re&s;t. The&s;e Accidents he judged were to be imputed to the Tenderne&s;s of the Parts, the Largene&s;s of the Monk's Finger which he thru&s;ts into the Bladder, and the too great Length of his <HI>Staff;</HI> and from this we may probably infer, that he was not at that time provided with &s;uch a <HI>Staff</HI> proper for Boys, as we are a&s;&s;ured he afterwards made U&s;e of. (36)</P>
<P>The fir&s;t living Per&s;on he Cut at <HI>Paris</HI> was a Woman. Out of the &s;e|cond he extracted Four or Five large <HI>Stones:</HI> The Patient lo&s;t a great deal of Blood in the Operation, and three Days afterwards a very great <HI>Hemorrhage</HI> happen'd, the Blood coming out through the Wound, the <HI>Penis</HI> and <HI>Anus</HI> at the &s;ame time; which made it plain that the <HI>Inte&s;ti|num Rectum</HI> had been cut; and accordingly he voided two Worms by the Wound, and Excrements were found upon the Tents applied to it. He had afterwards a <HI>Fi&s;tula,</HI> and died about two Months after the O|peration, but his Body was never opened. (37)</P>
<P>Of Three others which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> &s;aw <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Cut &s;oon after, one died of an <HI>Hemorrhage</HI> in two or three Days; Another was afflicted with a Tumour in the Groin different from an <HI>Hernia,</HI> and an Incontinency of Urine, tho' his Wound was cicatriz'd; the Third our Author could hear nothing of. (38)</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Per&s;on that he cut upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> died two Days after the Operation; and being opened, his Bladder was ob&s;erved to be torn as with an Iron Comb, by the <HI>Forceps</HI> and <HI>Curette,</HI> which had been &s;everal times thru&s;t into the Wound. (39)</P>
<P>The other Ob&s;ervations which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has given us, were made on the Bodies of &s;uch as <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> had Cut in the two Ho&s;pitals. The fir&s;t dead Body he di&s;&s;ected, was of a Man who died Five Days af|ter the Operation; his <HI>Scrotum, Penis</HI> and Bladder were gangreen'd, and the Left <HI>Levator Ani</HI> cut according to the Direction of the Fibres. In the Bladder remained one Piece of <HI>Stone</HI> of the Size of a Man's Thumb, and another &s;maller which was lodged between the Membranes of it.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="47">
<P>In the Second, the Inte&s;tines were all over inflamed, and &s;ome Parts of them gangren'd. The Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> was filled with a &s;tink|ing &s;erous Matter, the thicke&s;t Parts of which glewed the Inte&s;tines to one another, and al&s;o to the Bladder, <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> and <HI>Me&s;entery.</HI> The Bladder it&s;elf was gangrened, and there was a Wound in the Bottom of it, by which the Cavity of it had a Communication with that of the <HI>Abdomen:</HI> This Wound was round, and con&s;equently in all Probability made with the <HI>Catheter.</HI> There was likewi&s;e a Wound in the Neck of the Bladder, on that Side which lies next the <HI>Rectum,</HI> two Inches deep and one broad, with a Bit of <HI>Stone</HI> &s;till &s;ticking in it.</P>
<P>The Third Body had been Cut on the <HI>Gripe,</HI> and the Operator had begun his Inci&s;ion an Inch and a half higher than in the re&s;t. The Ca|vity of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> was here likewi&s;e filled with a &s;tinking pituitous Matter, which glewed the Inte&s;tines in the <HI>Hypoga&s;trick Region</HI> to the Bladder, and they were al&s;o very much inflam'd. The Neck of the Bladder was quite &s;eparated from the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and the whole Body of it inclining to a Gangrene. It was thicker and harder than ordinary, and between it and the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> there was found a great Quantity of Urine and extrava&s;ated Blood. The <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum</HI> was brui&s;ed and &s;hat|ter'd, and of a livid Colour.</P>
<P><HI>Mery</HI>'s Fourth Ob&s;ervations were made on Five Dead Bodies, Four of which had been Cut two Days before, the Other &s;ome time longer: But in this la&s;t the Lower Belly was &s;o much corrupted, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to examine whence that terrible Di&s;order proceeded. In the re&s;t he found the <HI>Urethra</HI> cut off from the Bladder, and the Blad|der &s;eparated from the <HI>Os Pubis;</HI> &s;o that the Nerves, Arteries and Veins of the <HI>Penis</HI> being by this means either broken or cut, there was a great Quantity of Blood between the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> and the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> of the <HI>Hypoga&s;trick Region;</HI> the most Part of which were very much brui&s;ed. In one of the&s;e Bodies the Inte&s;tines were every where inflamed, and in &s;ome Places gangrened, the Cavity of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> being filled with <HI>Pus.</HI> In two others it was filled with a &s;erous Matter dy'd with Blood. Four of the&s;e Patients, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> was inform'd, had been Cut upon the <HI>Gripe.</HI></P>
<P>His Fifth Ob&s;ervations were made upon the Bodies of Six Children, &s;ome of whom had been Cut upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> and others upon the <HI>Staff.</HI> In
<PB N="42" REF="48">all of them he found the Bladder &s;eperated from the <HI>Urethra</HI> and <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Penis</HI> broken or cut, the <HI>Rectum</HI> and all the Parts thereabout brui&s;ed, becau&s;e the Monk had thru&s;t his Fingers into the <HI>Anus</HI> of them all. Moreover, in one of them the Bladder was cut with the <HI>Bi&s;toury,</HI> from the back to the fore Part; in another, from the Left Side to the Right near the Neck. He found likewi&s;e a great deal of extrava&s;ated Blood; which, together with the Contu&s;ion of the Parts, had produced in &s;ome of them Inflammations and Gangreens, in others con&s;iderable Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, the Matter of which run out at the Wound.</P>
<P>The next were made on the Body of a Boy between Thirteen and Fourteen Years of Age, whom <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> had Cut upon the <HI>Gripe.</HI> Be&s;ides that, the Bladder was &s;eparated from the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> he found the <HI>Haemorroidal</HI> Arteries cut, which had produced an <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> at two different Times; and that, together with the Mortification of the Wound, were the chief Cau&s;es of his Death. What was further pecu|liar to this Operation was, that in pu&s;hing his Knife towards the Blad|der, <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> had open'd three different Pa&s;&s;ages, one at the lower Part of the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> the &s;econd between the Bladder and the <HI>Rectum,</HI> the third between the <HI>Peritonaeum</HI> and the Out&s;ide of the Bladder.</P>
<P>The Seventh dead Body was of a Child, which had likewi&s;e been Cut upon the <HI>Gripe;</HI> the Cavity of the <HI>Omentum,</HI> as well as the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> was full of a &s;erous &s;tinking Matter, the Sediment of which had glewed the Inte&s;tines to the Bladder, and all of them were gangrened at the Place of their Union. The <HI>Rectum</HI> was livid, and that as well as the Bladder &s;urrounded by a fetid Ulcer, the Matter of which run out at the Wound. In order to extract this <HI>Stone, Frere Jacques</HI> run his Knife from the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> between the <HI>Rectum</HI> and <HI>Perito|naeum,</HI> and entred the Body of the Bladder without touching either the Neck or <HI>Urethra,</HI> making a Wound about five Inches deep, which he could not do without Cutting a great Number of Blood Ve&s;&s;els, and cruelly dilacerating the Parts.</P>
<P>The Eighth Body was of a Child, who died near a Month after the Operation; but not having been opened, the only Ob&s;ervation that could be made was, that during all that Time the Wound continued open, and that the Urine came out that Way.</P>

<P>The next Male Body was likewi&s;e of a young Boy, who died &s;ix Weeks after he had been Cut. The Wound remained &s;till open, and was of a very livid Colour. Between the <HI>Rectum, Os Sacrum</HI> and <HI>Perito|naeum</HI> there was a fetid Ulcer, the Matter of which run out at the Wound; the Neck of the Bladder was parted from the <HI>Penis,</HI> and the Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Penis</HI> cut. The <HI>Rectum</HI> was wounded and gangrened; and by this la&s;t Accident it appears, that this Child had been Cut upon the <HI>Gripe.</HI> The Cavity of the <HI>Hypoga&s;trium</HI> was filled with a &s;erous pu|rulent Matter.</P>
<P>The next Ob&s;ervations are taken from great Numbers of dead Bo|dies; and, in re&s;pect of the re&s;t, may well be called General Ob&s;ervati|ons. In Three Patients Cut by <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> &s;ays our Author, Worms were &s;een to come out; in one through the Wound, in the other two through the <HI>Urethra;</HI> which makes it plain that the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum</HI> had been Cut in all of them, and a Communication opened, in the fir&s;t between that and the Wound, and in the re&s;t between it and the Bladder. Again, it was ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of his Patients died with Convul&s;ions, and all of them with a greater Lo&s;s of Blood than com|monly happens to tho&s;e who are Cut the Old Way.</P>
<P>The two la&s;t Ob&s;ervations were made on the &s;ame Body, partly be|fore and partly after the Death of the Patient. About &s;even Weeks after he had been Cut, his Wound was looked upon to be in a very good State, but as far from being clo&s;ed as at the Beginning: both Urine and a purulent glearious Matter, mixed with Gravel, continued to run through it, and the Patient was &s;till in a very weak Condition. In nine Weeks after he died, and his Body being opened, he was found to have a <HI>Fi&s;tula;</HI> the Entry thereof was very narrow, but farther in it was an Inch broad, and five Inches in Length, reaching from the Bent of the Buttock <HI>(Moignon de la fe&s;&s;e)</HI> to the Neck of the Bladder, and from thence between the Body of it and the <HI>Rectum.</HI> Into the innermo&s;t Part of it run Matter from an Ab&s;ce&s;s which lay between the <HI>Os Sacrum</HI> and the <HI>Rectum.</HI> All the Parts contained in the <HI>Hypoga&s;trium</HI> were very black; and as there is no room to doubt but that the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of the <HI>Fi&s;tula</HI> was owing to the Inci&s;ion, it is likewi&s;e probable, that before or after having cut that Part of the <HI>Urethra</HI> which joins to the Neck of the Bladder, he had lo&s;t his Way; &s;ince the Body ot the <HI>Fi&s;tula</HI> lay between the Bladder and the <HI>Rectum,</HI> and &s;ince it was evidently impo&s;&s;ible for him to make an Inci&s;ion five Inches deep, without cut|ting
<PB N="44" REF="50">many Ve&s;&s;els, and al&s;o making the Parts &s;uffer an extreme Vio|lence, in extracting the <HI>Stone;</HI> there is rea&s;on to think, that from the&s;e two Cau&s;es proceeded that Fluxion which produced the Ab&s;ce&s;s, the Matter of which had corrupted the Parts. (40)</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Ob&s;ervations which <HI>Mery</HI> has given us, concerning the Accidents which either attended or followed upon <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation; and by &s;eeing them all here at length, the Reader will not only have the Satisfaction of ob&s;erving all the various Kinds of them, but likewi&s;e which of them happen'd mo&s;t frequently, and in how many different Manners they were combined in different Subjects.</P>
<P>What the Author has remarked in &s;everal Places, concerning the particular Parts cut in particular Operations, will &s;erve to confirm and illu&s;trate an Ob&s;ervation I have already made, That it is not always a Proof, that where the Accounts which have been given of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Methods of Cutting are different from one another, &s;ome of them mu&s;t be fal&s;e; &s;ince by the In&s;tances our Author has here &s;et down, it is evident, that in the Cour&s;e of his Operations at <HI>Paris,</HI> he differed as much from him&s;elf as tho&s;e Accounts do from one another.</P>
<P>I go on, in the next Place, to the Conclu&s;ions which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has drawn from the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, as far as they relate either to the Operations them&s;elves, or to <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> as the Operator.</P>
<P>To begin by the Operations: The fir&s;t Conclu&s;ion concerning the&s;e, which I &s;hall mention from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> is, that in both <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Methods of Cutting, it is a very difficult Matter not to &s;eparate the Neck of the Bladder from the <HI>Urethra.</HI> This Propo&s;ition he proves thus: That Part of the <HI>Urethra</HI> which is join'd to the Neck of the Bladder, being &s;ituated in the Angle formed by the Union of the <HI>O&s;&s;a Pubis,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">at Part of the Inci&s;ion Knife being laid to the In&s;ide of the&s;e Bones, and of the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to reach the <HI>Urethra</HI> but in an Oblique Line; it mu&s;t therefore nece&s;|&s;arily be cut obliquely: Accordingly when he u&s;ed the Staff, he cut it half thorough, and con&s;equently de&s;troy'd half its Force; wherefore the Re&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Urethra</HI> being now weaker than the Effort which
<PB N="45" REF="51">he mu&s;t make to draw the <HI>Stone</HI> through the Neck of the Bladder, which in this Ca&s;e remains entire, the re&s;t of the <HI>Urethra</HI> is quite torn off and broken; to which this likewi&s;e very much conduces, that as he draws the <HI>Stone</HI> from above downwards in the Direction of the Wound, the Neck of the Bladder is forced out of the Direction of the Canal of the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and by this Means more ea&s;ily &s;eparated from it. The &s;ame Accident may likewi&s;e follow from the Violence he is obliged to u&s;e, in order to introduce either his <HI>Forceps</HI> or his Finger into the Bladder.</P>
<P>When he cuts upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> the Ca&s;e is &s;till more evident; for as here in making the Inci&s;ion, he has not the <HI>Staff</HI> to direct and re&s;i&s;t his Knife, the <HI>Urethra</HI> is liable to be cut quite through at once, as often as he meets with that Part of it which lies between the In&s;ide of the <HI>Os Pubis</HI> and the Neck of the Bladder; and to this, as we have &s;een, was owing the Death of many of the Children whom he cut this Way. (41)</P>
<P>A Second Conclu&s;ion drawn by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> is, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to prevent both Incontinency of Urine and Fi&s;tulas in <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Ways of Operating. To prove this, our Author begins by ob|&s;erving, That in the&s;e Methods it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that either the <HI>Urethra</HI> alone be cut, or the Neck of the Bladder alone, or the Body of it alone, or la&s;tly, the Neck and Body together. If the <HI>Urethra</HI> alone be cut, and be not torn afterwards from the Bladder, he thinks &s;uch Patients may recover perfectly. If either the Neck of the Bladder alone, or the Neck and Body together are cut, it is evident that the <HI>Sphincter</HI> mu&s;t be cut likewi&s;e; and as this Mu&s;cle can never recover again its former Tone, an Incontinency of Urine mu&s;t en&s;ue, tho' the Wound be never &s;o well cured. If the Body of the Bladder alone be cut, a Fi|&s;tula is inevitable, which he thus proves: The U&s;e of the <HI>Sphincter</HI> is to &s;hut the Bladder, and hinder the Urine from running out, except when the Bladder being compre&s;&s;ed by the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> the Urine is by this means, and by the Ela&s;ticity of its own Fibres driven towards the Neck of it, with a Force which is greater than the Re|&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Sphincter:</HI> But if when this Force is apply'd, at the time that the Bladder is wounded, the Re&s;i&s;tance will be le&s;s this Way than that which is made by the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> and con&s;equently the Urine mu&s;t flow out at the Wound, by the Continuance of which a Fi&s;tula will be formed. (42)</P>
<PB N="46" REF="52">
<P>Thirdly, The Incontinence of Urine and Fi&s;tulas which happen from this Way of Cutting are altogether incurable. Both the&s;e Inconveni|encies, our Author ob&s;erves, may attend the old Method; but then, as the Fibres of the <HI>Sphincter</HI> may not be quite de&s;troyed, it is po&s;&s;ible for them to contract again and recover their former Tone; whereas, when that Mu&s;cle is cut quite through, this can never be hoped for. Fi&s;tulas likewi&s;e which are &s;o &s;ituated, as that Cau&s;ticks and other pro|per Remedies may be applied to them, are curable; but in tho&s;e cau&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method of Cutting, this is impo&s;&s;ible. (43)</P>
<P>In the next Place, the <HI>Staff</HI> which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> makes U&s;e of is alto|gether in&s;ufficient to guide the Point of his Knife, or hinder it from &s;lipping, &s;ometimes to one Side, and &s;ometimes to the other. If his Knife pa&s;&s;es the <HI>Staff</HI> towards the fore Side of the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> it will be apt to enter the lower Part of the <HI>Scrotum;</HI> and by wounding the Ve&s;|&s;els, opens a Pa&s;&s;age for the Blood among&s;t the Membranes which have been cut: By this means Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, Inflammations and Gangrenes in the&s;e Parts are produced. If the Point of the Knife runs in behind the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> be&s;ides the Accidents mentioned in the foregoing Conclu&s;ions, he is liable to wound the Bladder through and through; and by this oc|ca&s;ion Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all the Parts contained in the <HI>Hypoga&s;trium.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the Place in which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> makes his Inci&s;ion, expo&s;es him very often to wound the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, be&s;ides the Convul&s;ions, Haemorrhages, and other mortal In|conveniencies which often happen upon his Cutting the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Penis, &amp;c.</HI> if any of the&s;e Patients &s;hould recover, they mu&s;t be impotent all their Lives after. (44)</P>
<P>This is the Sum of what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has told us concerning the Inconveniencies which he thinks may be gathered from the Nature of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations, as well as from the Ob&s;ervations which Ex|perience furni&s;hed him with. As for what relates to <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> him|&s;elf as an Operator, it is but of very &s;mall Importance for any body now a-days, to know wherein his particular Mi&s;carriages con&s;i&s;ted: They may be in general reduced to the&s;e two Heads; his Ignorance of the Structure of the Parts, join'd to a Defect of Judgment, which he
<PB N="47" REF="53">di&s;covered on many Occa&s;ions; and Ra&s;hne&s;s and Want of Attention in performing his Operations. To the la&s;t of the&s;e were owing the Wounds he often made in the Bladder with his <HI>Staff,</HI> and the different Pa&s;&s;ages by which he forced his Way into the <HI>Stone,</HI> with his Knife, Fin|gers, <HI>Forceps, &amp;c.</HI> in the &s;ame Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has likewi&s;e made a Compari&s;on between <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method of Cutting, with what was commonly practis'd at that Time; but as all the Particulars, upon which that Compari&s;on is founded, have been partly already taken Notice of in this Hi&s;tory, and the re&s;t belong to that of <HI>Marianus,</HI> it would be a u&s;ele&s;s Repetition to in&s;i&s;t any further upon it.</P>
<P>Before we leave Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI>'s Book, it will be proper to in&s;ert that Part of the Letter mention'd to have been written to him from <HI>Or|leans</HI> by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Noel,</HI> which contains the Hi&s;tory of the Operations <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> perform'd there.</P>
<P><HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Way of Cutting, &s;ays Mon&s;ieur <HI>Noel,</HI> differs from that which is commonly in U&s;e, only in the Place where the Inci&s;ion is made; for in&s;tead of the Region of the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> he begins his in the Fold of the Buttock, <HI>(ply de la fe&s;&s;e)</HI> from thence he goes obliquely, di|recting his Knife as much as he can towards the Neck of the Bladder; but as the different Thickne&s;s of the Parts in different Subjects varies his Operation con&s;iderably, it is no wonder that the Inci&s;ion is not al|ways in the &s;ame Place of the Bladder; e&s;pecially &s;ince it does dot ap|pear that he has any certain Rule for this, but cuts &s;ometimes higher, &s;ometimes lower, &s;ometimes further back, &s;ometimes further forward: However, this new Operation never &s;ucceeds better than when, either by Chance, or by the Dexterity of the Operator, the Inci&s;ion happens to be in the Neck of the Bladder.</P>
<P><HI>Frere Jacques</HI> perform'd Eight Operations in this City, Five in the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> and Three el&s;ewhere. The Fir&s;t was upon a Man of Fifty Years of Age, and both Phy&s;icians and Surgeons who were pre&s;ent a&s;|&s;ured me that it was done with a great deal of Dexterity; the <HI>Stone</HI> was much of the Size and Figure of an Egg, and none that &s;aw it doubt|ed of the Succe&s;s.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="54">
<P>However, Five or Six Days after the Patient was afflicted with a con|&s;iderable Haemorrhage, and on the Tenth with another; &s;ince that time he has felt extream Pains in the Region of the <HI>Perinaeum, Anus</HI> and <HI>Scrotum,</HI> cau&s;ed by an Ab&s;ce&s;s in the&s;e Parts, which is at length broken by means of proper Remedies applied to it. It open'd in the lower Part of the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and there came cut a great Quantity of pu|rulent Matter. Ever &s;ince, the Urine runs both that Way and through the Wound, tho' in a le&s;s degree than before. I have &s;een him dre&s;s'd &s;everal times; and by examining both Wounds, I find them di&s;po&s;ed to remain Fi&s;tulous. The Patient is in a very low Habit of Body, and in no Condition to undergo any further Tryals for a Cure.</P>
<P>The Second Operation was on a Man of Sixty. It was very long and trouble&s;ome; he lo&s;t the <HI>Stone</HI> &s;everal times, and at la&s;t it broke. It was of an Oval Figure, and about the Size of a Pidgeon's Egg. When it was out, there was a Part of the Inner Membrane of the Bladder found &s;tick|ing to it; and another Portion of a Membrane followed it &s;ome time af|ter, in which &s;ome Gravel was wrapt up. The Inci&s;ion, contrary to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, was begun at the Extremity of the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> and from thence run obliquely towards the Fold of the Buttock. The Operator had no Inci&s;ion Knife, but was obliged to make u&s;e of a Razor. Ever after the Operation, the Patient was troubled with the Hickup, a Loo&s;ene&s;s, and a great Ten&s;ion in the <HI>Abdomen.</HI> The <HI>Penis. Scrotum</HI> and <HI>Anus</HI> were brui&s;ed, and of a livid Colour almo&s;t like a Gangrene, which was prevented only by the Care and Skill of the Surgeon em|ploy'd. The Wound was always foul and rotten, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tronge&s;t Deter&s;ives that could be applied. It re&s;embled the Mouch of a Lampray both in Figure and Colour, and the Patient complained of an exce&s;&s;ive Heat in the <HI>Scrotum</HI> and End of the <HI>Penis,</HI> through which his Urine pa&s;&s;ed &s;ometimes, but with extream Pain; and it never cea&s;ed to come out at the Wound, which remained in &s;uch a mi&s;erable State, that his Death was not &s;urpri&s;ing to any. His Body, however, was not opened.</P>
<P>The Third Per&s;on <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Cut was Sixty Six Years of Age. He extracted two &s;moorh Oval <HI>Stones,</HI> both of them of the Size of an Egg. I was inform'd that this Operation was perform'd very dextrou&s;ly, and in very little Time. The Inci&s;ion was made lower than in the re&s;t, that is, at a greater Di&s;tance from the <HI>Scrotum.</HI> In Five or Six Weeks time the Patient was perfectly recovered. He has no Incontinency of
<PB N="49" REF="55">Urine, and it came through the Wound only for the fir&s;t Eighteen or Twenty Days</P>
<P>The Fourth Patient was about Eleven Years old, but his Wound is not as yet healed. What is particular in him is, that tho' &s;ome Urine &s;till continues to flow out at the Wound, yet the greate&s;t Quantity comes through the <HI>Penis,</HI> and not involuntarily neither. His Wound &s;eems now to be in a very good Di&s;po&s;ition, if the Urine that runs that Way does not hinder the Cure.</P>
<P>The Fifth was of the &s;ame Age, but he died the fourth or fifth Day after the Operation, with a Fever and Vomiting. This Operation was very trouble&s;ome and violent; and upon opening the Body, we found that the Inci&s;ion had been made on one Side of the Neck of the Bladder, &s;ome Part of the <HI>Sphincter,</HI> and a little of the Body being Cut. The Figure of the Wound was triangular, oblique and tran&s;ver&s;e, it ha|ving been made at different Times.</P>
<P>The Sixth Patient was Cut upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> and with a great deal of Ea&s;e. He extracted two <HI>Stones,</HI> both of the Bigne&s;s of a Walnut with the Husk on. The Thirty Fifth Day after the Operation the Urine began to come out the right Way; but the greate&s;t Part of it pa&s;&s;es &s;till through the Wound, and in all Appearance it will remain Fi&s;tulous.</P>
<P>The Seventh Operation was made on a young Man of Twenty Two Years of Age. <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> could neither find the <HI>Stone</HI> nor <HI>Staff</HI> with his Knife, which made it a long while before he could extract it. The Patient died in four Days with a high Fever and Vomiting; and when he was opened, we found the whole <HI>Sphincter</HI> Cut tran&s;ver&s;ely. (45)</P>
<P>To this Place likewi&s;e may belong the Reflections which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Saviard</HI> has made upon <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> in Ob&s;. 109.</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>July</HI> 1698 (it is printed by Mi&s;take 1696) I was &s;ent for to the Abby of St. <HI>Germain des Prez,</HI> together with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jacque|mier</HI> Doctor of Phy&s;ick, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tur&s;an</HI> Deputy (Lieutenant) to the
<PB N="50" REF="56">King's Fir&s;t Surgeon, Me&s;&s;. <HI>Collot, Tolet</HI> and <HI>Coliguon</HI> Lithotomi&s;ts, to examine the Wound of a <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monk, who had been Cut by an Operator nam'd <HI>Frere Jacques Beaulieu.</HI> We found the Patient ex|treamly fallen away, with a &s;low Fever, which had continued upon him ever &s;ince the Operation. His Wound, which we were told had been corrupted, was then ruddy enough without any Hardne&s;s or Tumour a|bout it, but as wide open as the fir&s;t Day it was made. We &s;aw the Urine run out at it, together with a glairous purulent Matter, and a gravelly Sediment.</P>
<P>It was our Opinion, that the Bladder was ulcerated, and that there were but little Hopes of his Recovery; we ordered what we thought proper, but he died the 21&s;t of <HI>September</HI> following, the Wound re|maining always open.</P>
<P>This <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> was and is &s;till looked upon by &s;ome People as a very wonderful Operator, notwith&s;tanding all the Di&s;coveries that have been made of his Mi&s;carriages; and that for four or five Rea&s;ons, 1. Becau&s;e he Operates differently from the other Lithotomi&s;ts. 2. Be|cau&s;e he &s;hows a great deal of Courage in Cutting, and A&s;&s;urance in bragging of his Feats. 3. Becau&s;e he appears to be di&s;intere&s;ted. 4. Becau&s;e he wears a Religious Habit, and has a great Air of Devotion. 5. Becau&s;e he pretends to have received all that he knows in Surgery by In&s;piration; and as it co&s;t him nothing, &s;o he is willing to teach other People <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Foundations of his pretended Merit, and it is a very ea&s;y Matter to examine the Solidity of them.</P>
<P>For in the fir&s;t Place, what Inference can be drawn touching his A|bilities from this, that he Cuts differently from other Lithotomi&s;ts? He is not a bit the better Operator for that, except his Method were pre|ferable to the re&s;t, which it certainly is in no re&s;pect, except in killing a greater Number of Patients, as appeared by the Tryals made of it at the Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="57">
<P>Again, is he a better Operator, becau&s;e he is bold and forwards? No certainly: for though A&s;&s;urance be very commendable in an Ope|rator; yet &s;till it is to be looked upon only as a &s;ubordinate Talent, and pre&s;uppo&s;es Knowledge and Skill, for otherwi&s;e it is pernicious; and that <HI>Frere Jaques</HI> was of this kind, is plain from the Number of Per&s;ons who died under his Hands.</P>
<P>His Readine&s;s to boa&s;t of the Cures he had performed, has always been looked upon as a Thing very unbecoming in any Body, but much more when founded upon Lyes and Fal&s;hoods. This is <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Ca&s;e; for as &s;oon as he arrived in <HI>Paris,</HI> he gave out, that by his New Method he cut without Pain; that his Patients would recover in much le&s;s Time than is u&s;ual, and that without any Danger of a Fi&s;tula, or other Accidents: All this has been found to be fal&s;e. His Method of Cutting is much oftner attended with Fi&s;tulas and Haemorrhagy than the others: He cau&s;es great Pains in Operating, and his Patients are a great while in recovering; his Boa&s;tings therefore ought rather to make him be de&s;pi&s;ed and undervalued, than be looked upon as any Thing extraordinary.</P>
<P>Can his Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s be reckoned a Proof of his Ability? This is, no doubt, a very commendable Quality in him, but he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s it in a greater Degree than the other Lithotomi&s;ts, as far as the Poor are concerned; for all who Cut in the Ho&s;pitals do it <HI>gratis,</HI> and even to &s;uch as are not there, there are very few who would refu&s;e their A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon the &s;ame Terms, when it is needful: But I mu&s;t own, if <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> pretends to extend his Charity to the Rich, he outdoes the re&s;t; but at the &s;ame time he exceeds the Bounds of his Duty, by a Zeal which, according to the Go&s;pel Phra&s;e, <HI>is not according to Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>His Religious Habit and Air of Sanctity are but equivocal Signs. We are all u&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch Dre&s;&s;es every Day, and therefore ought not to wonder at any Body who wears them: But with relation to <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> the Wonder is this; how if he is really and truly a Monk his Superiours &s;hould ever have &s;ent him on &s;uch an unaccountable Errand, as to go all over the Kingdom, and Cut People of both Sexes for the <HI>Stone;</HI> which he cannot do without viewing Objects which mu&s;t put that Cha&s;tity, of which he has made a Vow, to a very &s;evere Tryal;
<PB N="52" REF="58">or, if he be not a Monk, but only wears the Habit, how the Church &s;hould &s;uffer &s;uch a Di&s;gui&s;e, which mu&s;t infallibly &s;candalize great Numbers of People.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Wonder of all is, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> &s;hould be e&s;teem|ed an excellent Lithotomi&s;t, meerly upon Account of his Dre&s;s, as if that were &s;ufficient to give him more &s;ure and unerring Knowledge in Phy&s;ick and Surgery, than the mo&s;t famous Univer&s;ities, the reading good Books, the Le&s;&s;ons of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters, and a long Practice, can give to others.</P>
<P>I doubt not but <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Devotion has gained him the Confi|dence of many People; for this is a ready Way to lead People where|ever we have a Mind: But I doubt very much, if true Devotion can be con&s;i&s;tent with the vi&s;ible Prevarication which the Exerci&s;e of Surgery mu&s;t engage him in, if he be truly a Monk, or with the Di&s;gui&s;e he puts on, if he is not.</P>
<P>We have only now to examine, if he has obtained all that he knows in Surgery in a &s;upernatural Way, as he gives it out him&s;elf. Now the &s;ure&s;t Means to judge of the Nature of a Cau&s;e, is by the Effects it produces: If therefore <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> is directed, and immediately in&s;pired by God in all he undertakes, he ought always to &s;ucceed; and in that Ca&s;e he would certainly be the mo&s;t excellent Litho|tomi&s;t in the World. All that the others know, they are very ready to own comes to them, either from the In&s;truction of their Ma&s;ter, or their own Labour. But as every body mu&s;t now be con|vinced from what happen'd at both Ho&s;pitals, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> is le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful than they, it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe he is divinely in|&s;pired, except it be by the evil Principle of the <HI>Manicheans.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus enquired into the Rea&s;ons of &s;o many Peoples being prejudiced in Favour of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> I leave every Body to judge if the&s;e Prejudices be well founded, or ought not rather to be looked upon as Proofs of the Ignorance and Unskilfulne&s;s of this Religious Lithotomi&s;t.</P>

<P>As for the Propo&s;als he makes in the Publick <HI>Gazettes,</HI> to teach all Surgeons his Method <HI>gratis,</HI> it is the Magi&s;trates Bu&s;ine&s;s to hinder the&s;e Offers from being accepted; becau&s;e as his Method is pernicious, it ought rather to be aboli&s;hed than perpetuated, whatever he may pre|tend, that he has corrected his fir&s;t Method, that he has made good U&s;e of the Advices given him in the Ho&s;pitals of <HI>Paris,</HI> and that he now u&s;es the &s;ame In&s;truments with the other Lithotomi&s;ts; for all who are Judges mu&s;t know, that in order to make him a good Opera|tor, 1. He ought to retain nothing which makes his Method differ from the Common, which is certainly much better. 2. He ought to lay a|&s;ide a great deal of his Forwardne&s;s in operating, becau&s;e to that is owing the Temerity with which he thru&s;ts in his In&s;truments to Places which he knows nothing of, from whence irreparable Di&s;orders en&s;ue. 3. He ought to lay a&s;ide the Opinion he has of him&s;elf, of being the be&s;t Lithotomi&s;t in the Kingdom; than which nothing can be more fal&s;e, both becau&s;e his Method is bad, and becau&s;e he knows nothing of the Parts concerned, or to be &s;hun'd in the Operation; neither has he any Tincture of Surgery, to enable him to remedy the Accidents which may befall his Patients. While he retains this Pre&s;umption of his own Skill, it will be in vain to think of his making any Progre&s;s in the Art he profe&s;&s;es. 4. He ought to Cut for five or &s;ix Years in the Ho&s;pitals under able Ma&s;ters, who might direct him in his Operations, tell him of his Faults, and explain the Con&s;equences of them: For it is in this Manner that all the great Lithotomi&s;ts in <HI>France</HI> have been formed; whereas <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> while he continues to be fond of his own bad Method, intrepid in his Ignorance, ob&s;tinate in his Operati|ons, and pre&s;umptuous to Exce&s;s, will never ri&s;e above the Level of a Quack and a Vagabond.</P>
<P><HI>Dionis</HI> has made a great many Remarks on <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Methods of Cutting Males, but none of them are new; and therefore it will be &s;uf|ficient, to &s;at down here the Conclu&s;ion he draws from the whole Hi&s;tory of them. Tho' I do not approve of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Way of Cutting, &s;ays he, yet I do not ab&s;olutely condemn it, for there is &s;omething good in his Method; and I am per&s;waded, that a Surgeon, who is a good Anatomi&s;t, knows how to guide his In&s;trument, and is &s;o far Ma&s;ter of it as to carry it where he plea&s;es, may &s;ucceed in the Practice of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation, by rea&s;on that he would avoid all tho&s;e pernicious Accidents which attended his Performance; but it would be to expo&s;e the Patient to too great Dangers to cau&s;e him to be Cut by that Monk, who being wholly ignorant of the Parts to be Cut, his
<PB N="54" REF="60">bold A&s;&s;urance in thru&s;ting in his Poynard proceeds only from the Want of a &s;ufficient Stock of Knowledge to fore&s;ee the Con&s;equences. (46)</P>
<P>This Judgment of <HI>Dionis</HI> is very different from that given by <HI>Mery. Mery</HI> pretends to prove from the Nature of the Method it&s;elf, that it ought to be quite laid a&s;ide, as well as from the Character of the Monk, that he in particular ought never to u&s;e it. <HI>Dionis</HI> on the contrary is of Opinion, that the Inconveniencies that were found to attend it, were owing more to the Operator, than to the Nature of the Operation; tho' at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be own'd, that, take all his Words together, they amount to no more than this; <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation may be practi&s;ed with Succe&s;s by tho&s;e who are able to avoid whatever the Want of Succe&s;s in it is owing to.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden,</HI> by &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation was the &s;ame with <HI>Rau</HI>'s, and that <HI>Rau</HI> practis'd his with great Succe&s;s, de|clares &s;ufficiently what was his Opinion of it, notwith&s;tanding all the Inconveniencies which he had ju&s;t before mentioned from <HI>Dionis.</HI> The&s;e therefore he mu&s;t have look'd upon to be all owing to the Operator; and thus his Judgment will coincide with that of <HI>Dionis,</HI> with this Dif|ference only, that his he reckons to be confirmed by Matter of Fact, which the other does not pretend to. (47)</P>
<P><HI>Albinus</HI> conformably to the De&s;cription we have heard from him of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method, has given us his Opinion of it in the&s;e Words: This Way of Cutting, &s;ays he, could not well be more dangerous than either the making an Inci&s;ion into the Neck of the Bladder, or into the <HI>Urethra:</HI> And as by this Means both the&s;e remained untouched and altogether free from the bad Con&s;equences which u&s;ually attended the thru&s;ting in of In&s;truments, the violent Dilatations, and the extract|ing of large rugged Stones in a mo&s;t cruel Manner through &s;uch narrow Pa&s;&s;ages, this Method &s;eemed highly preferable to all the re&s;t. But on the other hand, as this Part of the Bladder lies altogether hid, it was a very difficult Matter to get at it; yet when this Opera|tion was rightly performed, no Part lay in the Way, of Con&s;equence enough to hinder the Succe&s;s of it.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="61">
<P>The Danger and Difficulty of it con&s;i&s;ted both in the Thickne&s;s of the Parts to be cut through, and the Nearne&s;s of &s;ome noble <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> which were by all Means to be avoided; for if either the Surgeon &s;hould happen to thru&s;t his Knife too far in, or too much to one Side, he runs the Ri&s;que of Cutting the oppo&s;ite Part of the Bladder, of hurt|ing the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales,</HI> of wounding or Cutting quite through the <HI>Ureter, Erector Penis, Corpus Caverno&s;um Majus,</HI> the <HI>Urethra</HI> it &s;elf, and of other &s;uch melancholly Accidents.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e after the Wound is made, it is an ea&s;y Matter to mi&s;take in introducing the <HI>Forceps,</HI> by thru&s;ting it not into the Bladder, but among&s;t &s;ome other Parts which it ought to have pa&s;&s;ed by, and thus open and dilate them, and pull out whatever came in its Way; which would not only fru&s;trate the De&s;ign of the Operation, but bring on many other Inconveniencies. Such Accidents we have both heard and read to have happened to <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> who neither knew the Stru|cture of the Parts, nor had any certain Method of guiding his Knife or <HI>Forceps;</HI> which la&s;t Mr. <HI>Rau</HI> looked upon to be the only Defect of his Operation.</P>
<P>Wherefore we are &s;o far from commending <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method of Cutting, that we are not afraid to a&s;&s;ert the Practice of it to be highly pernicious and de&s;tructive to Mankind; and had it not &s;erved as a Hint to lead <HI>Rau</HI> to the Di&s;covery of the be&s;t of all Me|thods, it had better never have been heard of.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Frere Jaques <HI>Method of Cutting Females.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have already mentioned, in &s;everal Places, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Cut Women as well as Men; but we have delay'd till now, to give an Account wherein the&s;e two Operations differ'd, and the Judgment that has been made of this Part of his Method.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI>'s Friend tells us upon this Head, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> cut|teth Women upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> and in the &s;ame Place as Men. He did per|form this Operation, continues he, in my Pre&s;ence upon Three; One whereof was a Girl of Eleven Years old; which maketh me believe that he u&s;eth the &s;ame Way in all, tho' in them he did Cut the Internal Neck of the <HI>Uterus.</HI> His Opinion therefore is, that this Way of Cut|ting is not &s;o &s;ure in Women, no more than in Men, as the Ancient Way.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> &s;ub&s;cribes to his Corre&s;pondent's Judgment: Tho' I have not tried this Way upon Women, &s;ays he, yet I cannot approve it at all, &s;ince one cannot avoid Cutting the Neck of the <HI>Uterus,</HI> the Cicatrix of which might prove to be of &s;ome ill Con&s;equence, in ca&s;e the Woman &s;hould come to be with Child. (49)</P>
<P>One of the three Experiments which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> &s;aw <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> make upon dead Bodies, was upon that of a Woman, and he has given us a particular Account of his Method of Operating. The Inci&s;ion, he &s;ays, was made on the Right Side, near the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Staff</HI> he u&s;ed for Men being fir&s;t introduced into
<PB N="57" REF="63">the Bladder. It was about an Inch and an half long; and by mea&s;uring the Situation of it by the means of cro&s;s Lines, he found that the lower Part of it an&s;wered to the <HI>Anus,</HI> the upper to the external Orifice of the <HI>Uterus,</HI> and the middle of it to the <HI>Raph&egrave;.</HI> The inward Progre&s;s of it was in this manner; After having pa&s;&s;ed about an Inch and an half of Fat, it went in betwixt the <HI>Levator Ani</HI> and the <HI>Accelerator</HI> of the <HI>Clitoris,</HI> cut|ting this Mu&s;cle at its Origin, and from thence pierced the <HI>Vagina</HI> quite through, beginning at the Back&s;ide of it, and thus reached the Body of the Bladder, which it wounded lengthways from the Beginning of the <HI>Urethra</HI> to the In&s;ertion of the <HI>Ureters,</HI> but without touching ei|ther of them. The Inci&s;ion in the <HI>Vagina</HI> and in the Bladder were each of them an Inch long.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Mery</HI> was at this Time as much prejudiced in favour of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> as he was afterwards again&s;t him, yet his Method of Cutting Women di&s;gu&s;ted him from the very fir&s;t Moment he &s;aw this Experi|ment. This appears from the Reflections which he &s;ubjoins to his De|&s;cription of it. If we judge, &s;ays he, of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Way of Operating upon Women, by the Structure of the Parts, and by the Inci&s;ion which he makes in the <HI>Vagina</HI> and Body of the Bladder, I cannot believe th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> the <HI>Stone</HI> can be extracted in them with the &s;ame Ea&s;e and Advantages as in Men, if he always follows the &s;ame Methods in both, as I have hi|therto &s;een him; I mean, if he begins his Inci&s;ion on the In&s;ide of the <HI>I&s;chium.</HI> For if we con&s;ider that the <HI>Urethra</HI> in Women is but &s;ix Lines in length beyond the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> that the Cavity is but a Line and an half in Diameter, and that it lies along the middle of the fore Part of the <HI>Vagina,</HI> which is two Inches broad, it will be ea&s;y to conceive that whatever Care <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> takes to put the <HI>Vagina</HI> out of his Way, and not to wound it, it will be very difficult for him to &s;hun it, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to get into the Bladder by the <HI>Urethra</HI> in the Way he takes, &s;ince it is &s;o very &s;hort and lies &s;o clo&s;e to the <HI>Vagina.</HI> Since therefore the <HI>Stone</HI> cannot be extracted by this Method, without Cutting the Body of the Bladder, I cannot believe it le&s;s dangerous than the common Way of drawing the <HI>Stone</HI> through the <HI>Urethra.</HI> As an Incontinency of Urine mo&s;t commonly happens in this Way, &s;o in that u&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> a Fi&s;tula of the Bladder into the <HI>Vagina</HI> appears to me inevita|ble; which; is at lea&s;t as great an Inconveniency, &s;ince the Urine flows equally involuntarily here. (50)</P>
<PB N="58" REF="64">
<P>The living Bodies which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> afterwards Cut, were but too evident Proofs of the Truth of the Reflections Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> here makes. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was Madam <HI>de Lorrain;</HI> he began the Inci&s;ion two Inches higher than he did upon the dead Body, and pierced the <HI>Vagina</HI> quite through, as appeared by the Quantity of Blood which run out of it. What other Accidents followed upon this Opera|tion, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has not told us; but we may judge what they were by the Ob&s;ervations which he made on other Subjects. (51)</P>
<P>On the 16th of <HI>May</HI> following, &s;ays he, <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> cut two Girls at the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> one upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> and the other upon the <HI>Gripe.</HI> The younge&s;t was but Four Years of Age, and went out of the Ho&s;pi|tal the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> the outward Wound being cured; but &s;he conti|nued to be troubled with an Incontinency of Urine. The other was Fourteen Years old, and went out the 25th of the &s;ame Month, in the &s;ame State with the other. Ju&s;t as &s;he was to leave the Ho&s;pical, I was &s;ent for to examine the Cau&s;e of her Incontinency of Urine, and I found that it came partly through the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and partly through the <HI>Vagina.</HI> Another Surgeon that was there injected Barley Water through the <HI>Urethra</HI> into the Bladder, which pre&s;ently flowed out at the <HI>Vagina,</HI> by which we di&s;covered, that tho' the exterior Wound all the Way to the <HI>Vagina</HI> was healed, the other Inci&s;ion from the <HI>Vagina</HI> to the Bladder was &s;till open. (52)</P>
<P>Now be&s;ides the Incontinency of Urine which attends this Accident, there are other Con&s;equences no le&s;s terrible that mu&s;t follow upon it, e&s;pecially if we take in the Danger there is in this Method, of falling into many of the &s;ame Inconveniencies which have been al|ready ob&s;erved in Men. Women mu&s;t by this means be rendered for ever barren, &s;ince the continual Flux of Urine into the Bladder mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily hinder the Action of the <HI>Semen;</HI> and as the <HI>Rectum</HI> may likewi&s;e be pierced, the gro&s;s Excrements may come out the &s;ame Way at the &s;ame time. From the&s;e and &s;uch like Ob&s;ervations, drawn partly from Experiments, and partly from the Analogy of the Structure of the Parts to be Cut in both Sexes, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> concludes, that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Way of Cutting Women ought upon no account whatever to be put in Practice. (53)</P>
<PB N="59" REF="65">
<P>Of the Eight Patients which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> cut at <HI>Orleans,</HI> One was a Girl between Ten and Twelve Years of Age, but &s;he died the Fourth Day after the Operation; and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Noel,</HI> in the foremention'd Let|ter to <HI>Mery,</HI> has given us the following Relation of it: <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> &s;et her upon the Knees of a Surgeon's Servant, and made two others hold her Thighs: He began by making a violent Pre&s;&s;ure upon the <HI>Hy|poga&s;trium,</HI> with his Fingers half bent, as if he had a mind to bring the Bottom of the Bladder nearer its Neck: Then he introduced a Silver <HI>Catheter</HI> into the Bladder, and pulled it out again as &s;oon as he had drawn off the <HI>Urine</HI> contained in it. Afterwards he put his two Fingers into the <HI>Rectum</HI> to command the <HI>Stone,</HI> and &s;o made his Inci&s;ion in the ordinary Place, only a little higher; and directing his Knife towards the <HI>Stone,</HI> he cut the Bladder. This being done, he made &s;everal Motions in the Wound, &s;ometimes with his <HI>Forceps,</HI> &s;ometimes with his Scoop, pre&s;&s;ing a-new upon the <HI>Hypoga&s;trium</HI> to bring down the <HI>Stone,</HI> but all to no purpo&s;e; so that at length he was obliged to thru&s;t his Fingers a &s;econd time into the <HI>Anus,</HI> and to u&s;e his Knife once more, in order ei|ther to make a new Inci&s;ion, or enlarge the former. Thus, by keeping the <HI>Stone</HI> well down with his Fingers, after two or three Efforts, he at length extracted it with his <HI>Forceps.</HI></P>
<P>The Operation was no &s;ooner over, but the Patient began to be tor|mented with Pains in her Belly, Fever and Vomiting, which never left her till &s;he died: Upon opening her Body, we plainly di&s;cerned that the Inci&s;ion had been made in the Middle and membraneous Part of the Bladder; that it was tran&s;ver&s;e and a little oblique, with three Angles ob&s;ervable in it, occa&s;ion'd by his having Cut &s;everal Times. The Bladder and all the Parts near it were filled with <HI>Pus,</HI> and in many of them there were Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es formed. The lower Parts of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> &s;uch as the Pyramidal Mu&s;cles and the Extremities of the <HI>Recti,</HI> were very much brui&s;ed, livid, and tending to a Gangrene, tho' there was no Blackne&s;s nor Swelling to be &s;een upon the Skin. (54)</P>
<P>We are told by <HI>Dionis,</HI> that one of the four Patients which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> cut in the <HI>Charit&eacute;</HI> of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> was a Girl of Seven Years of Age, who died three Days after the Operation. <HI>Dionis</HI> opened her in Pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Felix,</HI> one of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Patrons, and found the Bladder wounded in the Body near the Neck. In the <HI>Vagina</HI> there was a Wound of the Length of a Nail, made by the Edge of the Knife, in thru&s;ting it along that Part to come at the Bladder: On this
<PB N="60" REF="66">Occa&s;ion <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> &s;aid, that the Wounds of the <HI>Vagina</HI> are of no Con&s;equence, and that he frequently happened to pierce it. (55)</P>
<P><HI>Dionis</HI> &s;aw him cut Two Women more, and in both the &s;ame Ac|cidents happened, as appeared by the Blood which came out at the <HI>Vagina</HI> as &s;oon as the Inci&s;ion was made. And he ob&s;erves further, that the &s;ame thing fell out in almo&s;t all the Women he cut. (56)</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI>'s Method of Cutting for the Stone.</HEAD>
<P>THE Account which we have given from Authors, of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations for the <HI>Stone,</HI> is very far from being to their Advantage. The mo&s;t favourable thing that has been &s;aid of them, by any Body who was in a Condition to judge of their true Merit, is, that it is po&s;&s;ible they may &s;ucceed when perform'd by a skilful Hand; and that &s;ome few Ca&s;es may happen, in which they may perhaps be preferable to the ancient Methods. But Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> who has been at more Pains to examine them, than all the other Authors put together, declares him|&s;elf altogether again&s;t the Practice of them in any Ca&s;e; not only on ac|count of the bad Succe&s;s they were attended with in the Hands of that ignorant incon&s;iderate Monk, but al&s;o by comparing the Structure of the Parts concerned with the Nature of the Operation it&s;elf, and from thence deducing the many grievous Accidents with which the Practice of them will mo&s;t commonly, if not always, be attended.</P>
<P>All this, however, is to be under&s;tood of the&s;e Operations taken by the Lump; for when they are pulled to Pieces, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> even in the mid&s;t of all his Declamations again&s;t them, cannot help &s;eeing &s;ome Parts of them, which he thinks preferable to what an&s;wered to the&s;e in the former Methods of Operating. It was natural for a thinking Man to endeavour to bring &s;uch valuable Parts into Practice, by joining to them, either from his own Invention, or what was already in U&s;e, whatever he judged proper to compleat this whole Operation of ex|tracting
<PB N="62" REF="68">the <HI>Stone,</HI> freed from all the Di&s;advantages which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Methods, taken all together, &s;eem'd to him to labour under.</P>
<P>This is the general View, which not only Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> but all the other Improvers of them, propo&s;ed to them&s;elves in their Improvements. What the&s;e have been, and by whom made, I now go on to relate; that is, to explain &s;uch Methods of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> as differ from and were po&s;teriour to tho&s;e of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> but to the Di&s;covery of which the Authors of them have been led by Hints taken from what they ob|&s;erved in his.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Improvements, the fir&s;t that I hear of were made by Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Mery;</HI> but before I proceed to them, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething concerning this great Man's Life, by abridging the Eloge which the Elegant Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fontenelle</HI> has given us of him in the <HI>Me|moirs of the Academy of Sciences</HI> for the Year 1722. Printed in 1724.</P>
<P><HI>John Mery</HI> was born at <HI>Vatan,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Berry,</HI> the 6th Day of <HI>January</HI> 1645. His Father was a Surgeon; and after having &s;ent his Son for &s;ome Time to School, finding that, whether for Want of Inclination, or by the Fault of his Ma&s;ters, his Genius was not turned to Letters, he re&s;olved to bring him up to his own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>At Eighteen Years of Age he went to <HI>Paris,</HI> to improve him&s;elf in the <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> the be&s;t School in the World for young Surgeons. There, not &s;atisfied with the Exerci&s;es of the Day, he u&s;ed as often as he had an Opportunity, to convey a Body out of the Ho&s;pital to his Lodging, and hide it in his Bed till he had Time to di&s;&s;ect it.</P>
<P>In 1681, he drew up a De&s;cription of the Ear, at the De&s;ire of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>L'A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> Doctor of Phy&s;ick, to be in&s;erted in the Second Edition of his Book <HI>De L'A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e Sen&s;itive.</HI> It was in that Year likewi&s;e, that he was made Surgeon to the Queen.</P>
<P>In 1683, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Louvoy,</HI> then Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State, appointed him Surgeon Major to the Ho&s;pital of the Invalides.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="69">
<P>The Year after, the King of <HI>Porlugal</HI> having de&s;ited that a <HI>Pari&s;tan</HI> Sur|geon might be &s;ent him, his Queen being indi&s;po&s;ed, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> was pitched upon as the propere&s;t Per&s;on to execute that Commi&s;&s;ion. The Queen was dead before he reached <HI>Lisbon;</HI> but by the other ex|traordinary Cures which he performed during his Stay there, he gain|ed the E&s;teem of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> &s;o much, that they made him mo&s;t ad|vantageous Offers, in ca&s;e he would re&s;olve to &s;ettle among them. He had like Propo&s;als made to him in <HI>Spain,</HI> through which he pa&s;&s;ed; but he cho&s;e to accept neither of them, but to return to his own Country, which he did timely enough in that &s;ame Year, to be admitted a Mem|ber of the Royal Academy of Sciences, by the Recommendation of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> and to be appointed Surgeon to the Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy,</HI> then a Child, whom he accompany'd in a Journey the Court made to <HI>Chambort,</HI> a Royal Palace near <HI>Blois.</HI></P>
<P>In 1692, he was &s;ent by the Court on a &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and indeed it always remained &s;o: for to this Day no Body can tell what he went about.</P>
<P>In 1700, he arrived at the Heighth of his Ambition, being named by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlay,</HI> Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of <HI>Paris,</HI> to be Fir&s;t Surgeon of the <HI>Hotel Dieu.</HI> The Functions of that Po&s;t, together with his Place in the Academy, took up his whole Time; no Con&s;iderations but Friend&s;hip could ever per&s;wade him after that, to practice in the City, or teach Anatomy to any but his Pupils in the Ho&s;pital; and it was by his Means that the Anatomical Theatre was erected there.</P>
<P>His great Talent lay in the Exactne&s;s of his Ob&s;ervations. He thought it &s;ufficient for his Purpo&s;e, to &s;ee Things preci&s;ely as they exi&s;ted in Nature, without being often at Pains to build Sy&s;tems upon the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> he had di&s;cover'd. When he ventur'd &s;o far as that, he was convinc'd it was upon very &s;ure Grounds, and therefore was very &s;tiff in maintaining his own Opinions. His Hypothe&s;is concerning the Circulation of the Blood in a <HI>Foetus,</HI> was an In&s;tance of this; and his Defence thereof again&s;t the numerous Attacks that were made upon it, together with his Ob&s;ervations on the Methods of Cutting practi&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> a <HI>Francomtois,</HI> make up the only Book he ever publi&s;h'd. There are a great many Papers of his among&s;t the Memoirs of the
<PB N="64" REF="70">Academy; and he left behind him a va&s;t Number of valuable Prepara|tions of the Parts both of Men and other Animals.</P>
<P>He applied him&s;elf much to the Knowledge of the Blood Ve&s;&s;els and Nerves; but u&s;ed to give it to his Friends, as an In&s;tance of the Im|perfection of Human Knowledge, that the Nature and Actions of the Fluids contained in them had not been di&s;cover'd. Anatomi&s;ts, he told them, might be compared to Porters, who know all the Streets and Corners of a Town, but are intirely ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es with|in Doors.</P>
<P>They, who conver&s;ed much with him, attribute to him &s;everal Di&s;coveries which pa&s;s under other Peoples Names; of which the <HI>Glands</HI> a&s;cribed to Mr. <HI>Cowper,</HI> are one In&s;tance.</P>
<P>He died on the Third Day of <HI>November</HI> 1722, in the 78th Year of his Age, leaving Six Children behind him.</P>
<P>It appears from the Reflections Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has given us on <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations, that he had &s;een but very few of them, before he began to think of carrying them to a greater Perfection. It would be to no purpo&s;e, however, to trace all the Ob&s;ervations which lie &s;cat|ter'd up and down his Book to this purpo&s;e; he having &s;aved us that Trouble him&s;elf, by bringing them all under one View, in the la&s;t Chapter of that Treati&s;e, in which we may &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;tinctly fir&s;t, by what Steps he was led to the Improvem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nts he has made, where|in they con&s;i&s;t, and la&s;tly, what are the Advantages that he thinks may be expected from them.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, he acquaints us, That &s;ince the principal Di&s;orders which appeared in the dead Bodies of &s;uch Per&s;ons as had been Cut upon the Staff by <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> and which he had Opened, proceeded only from this, That his Staff being &s;olid and round, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him, with all the Steddine&s;s of Hand he was Ma|&s;ter of, to guide the Point of his Knife upon the Convex Part of it &s;o &s;urely, as not to mi&s;s it upon mo&s;t Occa&s;ions; One would be apt to think, that in order to rectify his Operation, and evite all the di&s;mal
<PB N="65" REF="71">Accidents that attended it, nothing &s;hould be requi&s;ite but to make u&s;e of a furrow'd <HI>Catheter;</HI> and to adju&s;t the Length of it &s;o exactly, as not to run the Ri&s;que of piercing the Bottom of the Bladder, as he frequently did.</P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider further, (&s;ays our Author) that the only Ca&s;es in which <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> extracts the <HI>Stone</HI> with more Facility than the other Lithotomi&s;ts, are when he Cuts both the Neck and Body of the Blad|der, which is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Part of his Operations, and was the chief Thing that procured him the Liberty of Cutting in the two Ho&s;pi|tals; and if we con&s;ider, on the other hand, that the wounding of the&s;e Parts is the evident Cau&s;e of the Incontinency of Urine and Fi&s;tulas, with which the mo&s;t Part of tho&s;e who &s;urvived his Operations were afflicted: When the&s;e two Things are attended to, I &s;ay, we will &s;ee that the Improvements I have mentioned are not &s;ufficient, but that it is moreover ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to ab&s;tain from cutting the Neck and Body of the Bladder.</P>
<P>Again, if we reflect, that the Rea&s;on why <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> ever wounds the <HI>Rectum,</HI> is only becau&s;e he begins his Inci&s;ion too low down, and that the Opening of the Nerves and Blood Ve&s;&s;els, from whence pro|ceeded the Hemorrhages, Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, and Convul&s;ions, which carried off &s;o many of his Patients, happen'd by thru&s;ting his Knife too far for|ward; we mu&s;t conclude, that it would be a much &s;urer Way to begin the Inci&s;ion in the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and end it at the Beginning of the Neck of the Bladder (<HI>al' eutr&eacute;e du col de la Ve&s;&s;ie</HI>) which is very often dilated by the <HI>Stone,</HI> which the Contraction of the Fibres of the Body of the Bladder has forced into the Cavity of it.</P>
<P>And therefore it is that I am inclined to think, that the greate&s;t Difficulty which the mo&s;t expert Lithotomi&s;ts find in extracting a <HI>Stone,</HI> proceeds more &s;eldom from the Neck of the Bladder than from the <HI>Urethra;</HI> becau&s;e as they Cut the <HI>Urethra</HI> on the Fore-&s;ide of the (<HI>au devant</HI>) of the <HI>O&s;&s;a Pubis,</HI> and the Neck of the Bladder lying behind the&s;e Bones, there remains at lea&s;t an Inch of the <HI>Urethra</HI> under that Angle formed by their Union, which is not cut, and through which the <HI>Stone</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s; that is, by a Way which is narrower than the Neck of the Bladder; it is this therefore which mu&s;t cau&s;e the Difficulty.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="72">
<P>Upon the&s;e Principles our Author's Improvements are founded: Wherein they con&s;i&s;t, he goes on to explain in the following Manner.</P>
<P>In order to rectify the ancient Operation, end that of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> likewi&s;e, and evite the Accidents which either accompany or follow them; I believe it would be proper, the Patient fir&s;t being placed and tied in the ordinary Manner, to begin by thru&s;ting a furrowed <HI>Cathe|ter</HI> into the Bladder with the Right Hand, then to hold it with the Left, and turn that End of it towards the Right Groin, that the Con|cave Part being directed to the In&s;ide of the Left <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> the Groove may lie a little obliquely. Afterwards taking in the Right Hand a crooked <HI>Bi&s;toury</HI> well fixed in the Handle, between Three and Four Inches long, Three Lines broad or thereabout, the Edge on the Convex Side, and ending in a very &s;harp pointed Stilet, about an Inch in length, thru&s;t it directly into that Part of the Groove which lies in the An|gle made by the Junction of the <HI>O&s;ia Pubis;</HI> conduct the Stilet all the Way into the Neck of the Bladder (<HI>conduire le Stilet du Bi&s;touri dans le Col de la ve&s;&s;ie</HI>) the Point of it being kept firm in the Groove of the <HI>Catheter;</HI> then lowering the Hand, make the Inci&s;ion down from the Neck of the Bladder, along the In&s;ide of the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> all the Way to the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium.</HI> The Inci&s;ion being made, introduce the <HI>Conductors</HI> or <HI>Gorgeret</HI> and <HI>Forceps</HI> in the ordinary Manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Leip&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">k Journali&s;ts</HI> have rendered this Pa&s;&s;age of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery, Conduire le Stilet du Bi&s;touri dans le col de la ve&s;&s;ie, Pars Aculeata Scalpelli u&s;&abque; in Ve&s;icae Collum adigenda;</HI> by which it is plain, they conceived that the Neck of the Bladder was to be pierced by the <HI>Stilet,</HI> it being in that Sen&s;e only that there could be any Force required, which is implied in the Word <HI>adigere:</HI> But this is very fat from being the Author's Mean|ing, the principal Part of his Improvement con&s;i&s;ts in leaving the Neck of the Bladder untouched; and by conducting the <HI>Stilet</HI> into the Neck of the Bladder, he under&s;tands no more than that as &s;oon as the <HI>Stilet</HI> was in the <HI>Groove</HI> of the <HI>Staff,</HI> the Operator &s;hould run it along that, all the Way into the Canal or Cavity of the Neck of the Bladder, which <HI>in collum veficae adigere</HI> can never be imagined to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Patient mu&s;t be made to lie upon the Right Side; becau&s;e by this Means the Urine not having &s;o ea&s;y a De&s;cent towards the Wound, will more readily be directed into its former Channel, which
<PB N="67" REF="73">will very much facilitate the Re-union of the divided Parts; and the common Practice of Binding the Patients Thighs, near the Knees, mu&s;t not be omitted.</P>
<P>In this manner, according to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> may the Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> be improved; and the Benefit which will re&s;ult there|from, he thinks, will be very con&s;iderable; for fir&s;t, the <HI>Stone</HI> may be extracted with as much Facility as in <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method, without any Danger of the Accidents which attend it. Likewi&s;e the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e Inconveniencies which accompany the common Operation will be evited, becau&s;e the <HI>Urethra</HI> will be cut all the Way to the Neck of the Bladder, without touching the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Penis,</HI> or wound|ing any Part of the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> which is mo&s;t commonly attended with Fluxions, Inflammations and Gangreen. La&s;tly, by following this Me|thod, we &s;hall never be under any Nece&s;&s;ity of Cutting upon the <HI>Gripe,</HI> either Men or Children, except when the <HI>Stone</HI> is got into the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and &s;ticks out in the <HI>Perinaeum;</HI> and in that Ca&s;e the common Way of performing this Operation &s;uffers no Difficulty. (1)</P>
<P>This is the Account that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> has given us of his own Method of Cutting Males, in order to extract the <HI>Stone;</HI> whether ever he put it in Practice or not is uncertain, but if we will be at pains to compare it with <HI>Marianus</HI>'s Operation and that of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> both to|gether, it will be found that what is new in it is only the Place in which he makes his Inci&s;ion, and the Figure of his Knife: And if we com|pare it with each of the&s;e Methods by them&s;elves, it will de&s;erve ra|ther to be called an Improvement of that of <HI>Marianus,</HI> than of <HI>Frere Jacques;</HI> for, properly &s;peaking, it was the Place in which he ob&s;erved this la&s;t to make his Inci&s;ion, that led him to alter the Place where <HI>Ma|rianus</HI>'s Followers make theirs, and pitch upon a new one equally diffe|rent from both. The other Parts of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI>'s Operation he has no manner of Title to; but &s;till, &s;ince the Merit of an Invention is only to be determined by its U&s;efulne&s;s, did this &s;mall Improvement rid his Operation of the Inconveniencies which the others are liable to, he might ju&s;tly claim the &s;ame Share of Acknowledgment from Man|kind, as if he had invented a Method entirely new.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> had no &s;ooner &s;een <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> make an Experiment of his Method upon the dead Body of a Woman, but he thought of
<PB N="68" REF="74">rectifying that Part of his Operation likewi&s;e: For having made the Reflections which have been already mentioned, concerning the Incon|veniencies of it, he adds, That if it &s;hould appear from Experience, that his Conjectures about the&s;e Inconveniencies were ill grounded, and that both the Wounds of the <HI>Vagina</HI> and Body of the Bladder are ea&s;ily cured, he hath a Way to propo&s;e for Cutting of Women, which mu&s;t &s;till be preferable to that of the Monk. His Method is this: Let a furrowed <HI>Catheter,</HI> &s;uch as is commonly u&s;ed for Men, be intro|duced into the Bladder, and with the Convex Part of it pre&s;s down to the Entry of the external Orifice of the <HI>Uterus (a l'entr&eacute;e de l'Orifice externe de la Matrice)</HI> that Part of the <HI>Vagina</HI> which lies under the Ex|tremity of the Body of the Bladder, and the Beginning of the <HI>Urethra</HI> which is joined to it; then cut that Part of the <HI>Vagina</HI> upon the <HI>Groove</HI> of the <HI>Staff;</HI> and thus it will be ea&s;y to get into the Bladder without hurting the <HI>Urethra,</HI> if the Inci&s;ion is made but a very little Way up in the <HI>Vagina.</HI></P>
<P>By this Method the <HI>Stone</HI> may be extracted out of the Bladder of a Woman with the &s;ame Advantages that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> does it in Men; becau&s;e, as it mu&s;t pa&s;s through the <HI>Vagina,</HI> it will pa&s;s out at the broade&s;t Part of the Angle which is formed by the Union of the <HI>O&s;&s;a Pubis.</HI></P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be made u&s;e of in young Girls, and is undoubtedly more &s;ure and le&s;s painful than that u&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques.</HI> The Wound made in the <HI>Vagina</HI> needs not be above Two Lines deep; whereas in his Method there mu&s;t be &s;everal Inci&s;ions, which taken all together, are at lea&s;t Three Inches deep; for he not only pierces the <HI>Vagina</HI> twice, but the Wound he makes from the Buttocks into it is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This Method &s;eems, moreover, to be better than that of Drawing the <HI>Stone</HI> through the <HI>Urethra,</HI> becau&s;e as both that and the <HI>Sphincter</HI> of the Bladder remain untouched, there is no Danger of an Incontinency of Urine, which mo&s;t commonly follows the other. (2)</P>
<P>The Suppo&s;itions upon which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery</HI> builds the Advantages of this new Method of Cutting Women, are, we &s;ee, that Wounds in the
<PB N="69" REF="75"><HI>Vagina</HI> and in the Body of the Bladder may be cured; but tho' upon the Tryals he afterwards made on dead Bodies, he was fully &s;atisfied how ea&s;ily it might be put in Practice, yet the Ob&s;ervations he had oc|ca&s;ion to make of &s;uch as had been Cut by <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> convinced him at length that the&s;e Suppo&s;itions were fal&s;e; and con&s;equently, that this Method, however improved, was altogether to be rejected. This he te&s;tifies in the following Words: As for <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Way of Cut|ting Women and young Girls, &s;ince there remains always a Fi&s;tula from the Bladder into the <HI>Vagina,</HI> it is evident that neither that, nor the Method in which I propo&s;ed it to be amended, ought ever to be put in Practice: There is no other Way left but to draw the <HI>Stone</HI> through the <HI>Urethra;</HI> and tho' an Incontinency of Urine &s;hould remain, it does not make them incapable of Conceiving, which is very much to be feared from that which proceede from a Fi&s;tula. (3)</P>
<P>Before I take leave of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery.</HI> I cannot forbear remarking that &s;omething very like the Way he here propos'd for Cutting of Wo|men is mentioned by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere;</HI> but as that Author had put it in Practice before <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operations were known to him, it can|not be called an Improvement of the&s;e; and therefore I did not take Notice of it in that Place, which, as being publi&s;hed before that of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mery,</HI> it would otherwi&s;e have de&s;erved.</P>
<P>In Women, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere,</HI> when the <HI>Stone</HI> is but indifferent big, the old Way is preferable to any other; but if it was very big, then I had rather thru&s;t my Finger into the <HI>Vegina,</HI> and bring the <HI>Stone</HI> as near the Neck of the Bladder as can be, and cut the Membranes of the <HI>Va|gina</HI> and Bladder upon the <HI>Stone.</HI> I did Cut a Woman in <HI>Hambourgh</HI> by that Way, of which I drew a <HI>Stone</HI> weighing five Ounces and an half, who did recover very well. By this Way we did prevent the Inconti|nency of Urine, which follows always the Extraction of great <HI>Stones</HI> in Women. (4)</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Profe&s;&s;or</HI> Rau<HI>'s Method.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next Improvement of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Operation for the <HI>Stone,</HI> was made by Mr. <HI>Rau</HI> in <HI>Holland:</HI> But before I lay before the Reader wherein it con&s;i&s;ted, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to make him a little acquainted with that great Man's Life, by a &s;hort Abridgment of the elegant and faithful Account which the learned Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Albinus</HI> has lately publi&s;hed of it.</P>
<P><HI>John James Rau</HI> was born at <HI>Baden,</HI> a &s;mall Town in the Circle of <HI>Suabia</HI> in the Year 1668. His Father was a Wine Merchant, and in &s;uch indifferent Circum&s;tances, that he was obliged, as the be&s;t Pro|vi&s;ion he could make for his Son, to bind him Apprentice to a Surgeon in <HI>Strasburg,</HI> before he was full Fourteen Years of Age: There he re|mained Three Years; and in that Time thinking he knew enough of his Bu&s;ine&s;s to gain his Living in any Part of the World, he re&s;olved to bid adieu to his own Country, and try his Fortune &s;omewhere el&s;e. After he had travelled through &s;ome Part of Germany, he went to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> from thence to <HI>Norway,</HI> where he lived at <HI>Bergen</HI> with Mr. <HI>Franen</HI> the Surgeon, and &s;oon after to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> being unable to en|dure the rigorous Cold of that Climate. At <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> he had the good Luck to get to be Surgeon of a Man of War, in which he went to <HI>Spain</HI> and other Countries; and upon his return to <HI>Holland,</HI> he went on board the Vice-Admiral of that Fleet, which brought King <HI>William</HI> to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<PB N="71" REF="77">
<P>During his Service at Sea, he found Means to &s;ave as much Money as enabled him to go to <HI>Leyden,</HI> and there &s;tudy Phy&s;ick for &s;ome Time; after which he went to <HI>Paris</HI> to improve him&s;elf in Anatomy and Surgery under <HI>Du Verney, Mery, Mare&s;chal, Roumart,</HI> Old <HI>Petit,</HI> and others. In 1694, he returned to <HI>Leyden,</HI> and there took his Degree of Doctor of Phy&s;ick, being then but Twenty-&s;ix Years of Age.</P>
<P>Being by this Time weary of a wandring Cour&s;e of Life, he re&s;olv'd to &s;ettle at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and to teach Anatomy, and practice Phy&s;ick and Surgery: He remained there &s;omething more than Eighteen Years; but Two of them were not pa&s;t before he had already acquired &s;o great a Reputation in Anatomy, that the Magi&s;trates of that City ap|pointed him to di&s;&s;ect in the publick Theatre. He was likewi&s;e &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the Practice of Surgery, that he was &s;ent for all over <HI>Hol|land</HI> by tho&s;e who needed his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and for the Sake of no Ope|ration &s;o much as that of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> which he performed up|on above Sixteen Hundred People, with the greate&s;t Applau&s;e, and equal Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>In 1705, he was &s;ent for to <HI>Leyden,</HI> to give &s;ome Publick Le&s;&s;ons of Anatomy; and in 1713, he was made Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick, Anatomy, and Surgery, in that famous Univer&s;ity, upon the Death of Doctor <HI>Bid|loo.</HI> While he remained in Health, he was extremely diligent in di&s;|charging the Functions of that honourable Profe&s;&s;ion; but his Health abandoned him above Four Years before his Death, which happened in a very lamentable Manner on the 18th Day of <HI>September</HI> 1719. in the Fifty fir&s;t Year of his Age.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Anatomical Trea&s;ure which he bequeathed to this Uni|ver&s;ity, and of which we are obliged for a very ample and methodical Account to the Author of his Life, he left the World his Oration <HI>De Methodo Anatomen Docendi &amp; Di&s;cendi,</HI> pronounced on the Day of his Reception as Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden;</HI> a <HI>Latin</HI> Letter <HI>De Inventoribus Septi Scroti,</HI> and a Defence of it again&s;t Dr. <HI>Ruy&s;ch;</HI> together with &s;everal Improvements both in Anatomy and Surgery, the Chief of which may be ju&s;tly reckon'd the Di&s;coveries he has made of the true Method of Cutting for the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>

<P>Thus far concerning the Life of our famous Lithotomi&s;t; we go on now to the &s;ame <HI>Albinus</HI>'s Account of his Lithotomy.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the other Parts of Surgery which <HI>Rau</HI> had learned at <HI>Paris;</HI> the Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> by what is called the great <HI>Apparatus</HI> was one, and it is certain, that for &s;ome time after he fixed at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> he practis'd it in that manner him&s;elf; but upon &s;eeing <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Cut in <HI>Holland,</HI> and having examined the Bodies of many &s;uch as died in that Monk's Hands, he from that Time changed his Method of Cut|ting in the Manner which we are now to explain.</P>
<P>Several Accounts have been publi&s;hed, and many more handed about concerning this Method of Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Rau,</HI> but all of them trifling, fal&s;e, and imperfect; and had not the learned <HI>D. Albinus,</HI> who has often &s;een <HI>Rau</HI> Cut, and is a perfect Judge of the&s;e Matters, thought it worth his while to oblige the World with an accurate and particular Relation of all the Seeps of his Operation, we mu&s;t have de&s;paired of ever ha|ving a true Knowledge of it.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="79">
<P>I &s;hall trouble the Reader but with Two of the&s;e Accounts, both of them printed; the fir&s;t by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Phy&s;ician; and the other, of which &s;omething has already been &s;aid, by Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden.</HI></P>
<P>We are told by the Phy&s;ician, that in his Travels through <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> he arrived on a certain Time at <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and being there re&s;olved to attend Dr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s Cour&s;es of Anatomy and Surgery, among&s;t other Curio&s;ities he &s;aw there, one was the Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> perform'd by him.</P>
<P>The 7th Day of <HI>February</HI> 1707, &s;ays the Traveller, I and Mr. <HI>Wick|ham</HI> went with our Ma&s;ter <HI>Rau</HI> to <HI>Cromenic,</HI> a Village near <HI>Harlem,</HI> where a Boy was to be Cut; which was done in the Pre&s;ence of two Surgeons and Burghers of the &s;aid Town. After the Body was di&s;|po&s;ed in a proper Po&s;ture with his Arms bound, and his Po&s;teriours laid higher than his Head, and his Feet &s;o tied, that the Part to be Cut could not be moved; Mr. <HI>Rau</HI> kneeling with one Knee upon the Table, &s;ets him&s;elf directly before the Patient, thru&s;ting in a common <HI>Catheter</HI> moi&s;ten'd with Oil into the Yard; at la&s;t meeting with the <HI>Stone,</HI> he withdraws that, and puts in another <HI>Catheter,</HI> &s;o deep that he might feel it upon the <HI>Perinaeum</HI> with his Fingers; then he makes an Inci&s;ion in the Left Side of the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> four Fingers breadth from the Tubero&s;ity of the <HI>Os I&s;chium,</HI> or Huckle Bone, and a Fingers breadth from the <HI>Anus,</HI> which Place of Inci&s;ion the <HI>Catheter</HI> depre&s;&s;es to|wards the <HI>Perinaeum.</HI> His Inci&s;ion Knife was guarded a Thumbs breadth, looking like a common Launcet, which was not laid above the length of the fir&s;t Joint of the Finger: Fir&s;t he cut the Skin, and then making an Inci&s;ion through the Fat and the Mu&s;cles, he applied his <HI>Itinerary;</HI> after which he penetrated the Neck of the Bladder, then putting in the Penknife into the Wound, holding it &s;trongly with his Hand, he delivered it to me; but in the mean time &s;natched up his <HI>Forceps,</HI> and drawing out his Penknife, he thru&s;t it in betwixt the <HI>Iti|nerary</HI> and <HI>Conductor,</HI> dilating the Lips of the Wound by tho&s;e two &s;aid In&s;truments, by which means he happily drew our the <HI>Stone.</HI> When it was extracted it was of the Size of a little Hen's Egg, moi&s;ten'd with Blood, and on one Side &s;urrounded with a &s;mall little Membrane, where perhaps it had an Adhe&s;ion to the Side of the Bladder. It was almo&s;t of a round Figure and uneven, like a large Sand or gretty Stone. Clean&s;ing the Wound with a Spunge, he applied nothing but a little Lint; and &s;o binding up the Patient he put him to Bed, placing under his Buttocks &s;ome Oatmeal to receive the Urine, that would run from
<PB N="74" REF="80">the Wound and the <HI>Faeces</HI> upon Occa&s;ion. He ordered the Curtains of the Bed to be drawn clo&s;e, that the Light might not di&s;turb the Patient's Re&s;t, to compo&s;e whom he ordered an Anodyne Emul&s;ion to be drunk <HI>ad Libitum.</HI> After the Operation, and the Sick being ju&s;t laid upon the Bed, he cried out of exqui&s;ite Pains in the <HI>Glans</HI> of the Yard, when the <HI>Stone</HI> was taken away, which happens by Con&s;ent; in all which the Membrane of the <HI>Urethra</HI> has with the inward Membrane of the Bladder.</P>
<P>On the 7th of <HI>March,</HI> I &s;aw another Lithotomy or Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> performed by my Ma&s;ter on a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Boy of Seven Years old; in which, be&s;ides what I have already told you, nothing particular hap|pened, except the falling down of the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the Cries of the Patient; which lubricating with Oil he put up again with his Fingers, lea&s;t it &s;hould hinder him in his Operation.</P>
<P>By comparing this Account of <HI>Rau</HI>'s Operation with that which is given by <HI>Albinus,</HI> it will be very ea&s;y to &s;ee how full it is of Mi&s;takes, that is, how much it is of a-piece with all the re&s;t of this Author's Book.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> makes <HI>Rau</HI>'s Method to be the &s;ame with that of <HI>Frere Jacques;</HI>for after tran&s;cribing &s;ome few Things from <HI>Dionis</HI> about that, he tells us, that the late Mr. <HI>Rau,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy at <HI>Leyden,</HI> per|form'd it afterwards in <HI>Holland,</HI> Cutting exactly between the Entrance of the <HI>Ureters,</HI> and with great Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not a little &s;urprizing how Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden,</HI> who is &s;o perfectly well acquainted with the true Structure of the&s;e Parts of the Body, came to let him&s;elf be &s;o gro&s;ly impos'd upon by the Per&s;on that gave him this Ac|count of <HI>Rau</HI>'s Operation, which the lea&s;t Reflection mu&s;t have convinced him to be fal&s;e and impo&s;&s;ible, as &s;hall be pre&s;ently &s;hown. What he has added, is I believe very ju&s;t; at lea&s;t it de&s;erves the Attention of all &s;uch as &s;hall ever undertake the Practice of Mr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s Operation. In my Opinion, &s;ays he, this Way of Cutting exceeds the two former, (that is, the greater and le&s;&s;er <HI>Apparatus</HI>) and would be yet better, if the Bladder was filled with Water before the Operation.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many other &s;uch as the&s;e Accounts, have been given of Mr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s Method of Cutting for the <HI>Stone;</HI> and I have only &s;et down
<PB N="75" REF="81">two Samples of them, to &s;how what need there was of a more exact and compleat Explanation of an Operation, which the Succe&s;s wherewith it was attended mu&s;t recommend to our mo&s;t &s;erious Thoughts. This the ingenious Dr. <HI>Albinus</HI> has fully executed in the Manner which we now proceed to &s;how.</P>
<P>After having explained the Method of Cutting u&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> and given his Opinion of it, which as we have already &s;een, he con|cludes with this Ob&s;ervation, That it had better never have been heard of, had it not &s;erved as a Hint to lead <HI>Rau</HI> to the Di&s;covery of his: He goes on to inform us, that <HI>Rau</HI> having fully examined the Stru|cture and Situation of the&s;e Parts, which are either to be cut or &s;hun'd in this Operation, di&s;covered the only Defect of <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Method to be the Want of &s;ome Way whereby the In&s;truments might be &s;afely and &s;ecurely directed towards the proper Place of the Bladder. This he al&s;o found out, and u&s;ed it with the greate&s;t Succe&s;s. It can|not therefore be deny'd but that <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> &s;hewed <HI>Rau</HI> the Way; for this, however, he ought always to be prai&s;ed and valued, that by his own Skill and Indu&s;try he made that Addition to the Operation, by which alone it is rendered &s;ure and &s;afe, and preferable to all that have hitherto been invented, whereas before, it was dangerous, un|certain, and oftentimes fatal.</P>
<P>His Addition con&s;i&s;ted in a <HI>Catheter</HI> furrowed or grooved on the Convex Side, which he thru&s;t through the <HI>Urethra</HI> into the Bladder, that Convex Side pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the Part of it which was to be Cut, &s;o as to be felt without; and by this Means &s;erving to direct him in making the Wound in the Skin, in thru&s;ting in the Knife, &s;o as to cut the Bladder upon it, and in introducing the other In&s;truments which guide the <HI>Forceps</HI> &s;trait into the Wound, as was practi&s;ed in the great <HI>Apparatus.</HI></P>
<P>But as the Common <HI>Catheters</HI> made U&s;e of by tho&s;e who cut the <HI>Urethra</HI> in the <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> are for the mo&s;t part too little bent to be able to pre&s;s &s;ufficiently again&s;t the proper Place of the Bladder, he invented a new one, different from the others; fir&s;t, in that where the crooked Part, and con&s;equently the <HI>Groove</HI> begins, the <HI>Curvature</HI> was greater, and al&s;o in that the <HI>Ro&s;trum</HI> or Beek at the other Extremity of the crooked Part was &s;traiter and longer, that the Knife might be at
<PB N="76" REF="82">more Liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">un both Ways upon it, and &s;o make a large Wound in the Bladder. The Compari&s;on of the Structure of the&s;e Parts in the humane Body, with what was to be done in the Operation, &s;eem to have led him to the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>He placed the Patient, ty'd him, and ordered him to be held almo&s;t in the fame Manner as they who cut the <HI>Urethra</HI> in the <HI>Perinaeum;</HI> except that he laid him upon his Back on a low Table, in &s;uch a Manner as that his Back was lower than his Buttocks, for the more convenient Situation of the Part to be cut.</P>
<P>Then he kneeled down before the Patient upon his Right Knee, his Left Leg being erect, and making an acute Angle with the Thigh, the better to &s;upport his Body.</P>
<P>Next laying hold of the <HI>Penis</HI> with his Left Hand, with his Right he thru&s;t the <HI>Catheter</HI> artfully into the Bladder.</P>
<P>Then taking the Handle of the <HI>Catheter</HI> between the Fingers and Thumb of his Left Hand, he turned it gently and warily towards the Patient's Belly and right Groin, that the furrowed Convex Side there|of might be apply'd to that Part that was to be Cut; that is, as has been already &s;aid, to the Left Side near the Neck, and &s;omething to|wards the lower and back Part.</P>
<P>This being done, he pre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Catheter</HI> gently towards that Part, and at the &s;ame time put his Right Thumb upon the &s;oft Place of the Buttocks, on the Left Side of the <HI>Anus,</HI> between that and the great Protuberance of the <HI>Os I&s;chium,</HI> upon which we &s;it, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Convex Part of the <HI>Catheter.</HI></P>
<P>Then pre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Catheter</HI> gently towards his Right Thumb, and at the &s;ame time his Right Thumb towards the <HI>Catheter,</HI> from the Left and lower Parts to the Right and upwards, he di&s;covered and marked the exact Place on the Out-&s;ide which was oppo&s;ite to the Convex Part of the <HI>Catheter,</HI> for there the Inci&s;ion was to be begun.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="83">
<P>This Place was on the Left Side of the <HI>Anus,</HI> about an Inch, or two Fingers breadth from that, towards the Protuberance of the <HI>I&s;chium.</HI> He cho&s;e it no nearer the <HI>Anus,</HI> for fear of hurting the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum;</HI> and no further from it, that he might not be obliged to thru&s;t the Knife too obliquely towards the <HI>Catheter:</HI> However, according to the Difference of Age and Stature, Structure, and Largene&s;s of the&s;e Parts, he cut the Skin &s;ometimes nearer the <HI>Anus,</HI> &s;ometimes farther from it, and &s;ometimes a little higher or lower; but the Convex Pare of the <HI>Catheter,</HI> which pre&s;s'd upon the Bladder, always directed him to the Place.</P>
<P>This being di&s;covered, he began by Cutting through the Skin and a &s;mall Part of the Fat. He made the Wound &s;trait and long, from above downwards, and a little inclined outwards towards the Protu|berance of the <HI>I&s;chium,</HI> to keep farther from the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum.</HI> A|bout this fir&s;t Inci&s;ion, however, he was not very &s;ollicitous.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was made, he thru&s;t into it that Part of his Right Thumb or Fore-Finger, which is oppo&s;ite to the Nail, to feel the <HI>Staff,</HI> which he kept with his Left Hand apply'd to that Part of the Blad|der which he was to cut, with all po&s;&s;ible Steddine&s;s.</P>
<P>When he had found the <HI>Staff</HI> he pulled back his Thumb, and thru&s;t the Point of his Knife immediately into the Wound, not very deep at fir&s;t; and directing it with all the Caution he could towards the <HI>Staff,</HI> he cut gently all that came in his Way: And for fear of wounding the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum,</HI> he mo&s;t commonly fir&s;t thru&s;t his Finger into the <HI>Anus,</HI> to examine the Situation of it preci&s;ely, that &s;o he might be able to &s;hun it with the greater Certainty.</P>
<P>When by the&s;e gentle Steps his Knife had got almo&s;t to the Bladder, he thru&s;t his Thumb or Fore-Finger again into the Wound to feel for the <HI>Catheter</HI> as before, to replace it, if by any Motion of the Patient it had changed its Situation, and al&s;o to remind him&s;elf of the Po&s;ition of the Convex Part of it, upon which he was immediately to cut the Bladder.</P>
<P>In doing this he u&s;ed more Caution and Circum&s;pection than before: He fir&s;t begged of the A&s;&s;i&s;tants not to let the Patient move any Part, e&s;pecially his Buttocks, and of the Patient him&s;elf to keep as quiet as po&s;&s;ible; then holding the <HI>Catheter</HI> fixed in its Place with the Left
<PB N="78" REF="84">Hand, with the other he approached the Knife towards it, through the Wound, without making any further Inci&s;ion, but only carefully direct|ing the Point. This done he thru&s;t it into the Groove of the <HI>Catheter</HI> with all the Attention and Warine&s;s he was Ma&s;ter of: And it was ea&s;y for him to know when he was right, by the Point of his Knife pre&s;&s;ing upon the Bottom of the Groove, and upon the Sides of it when he moved it gently either Way.</P>
<P>Then carrying the Knife along the Groove both upwards and down|wards, but mo&s;tly downwards, and favouring the Motions of it by the Po&s;ition of the <HI>Catheter,</HI> he made a pretty large Wound in the Blad|der. The Situation of the <HI>Staff</HI> made the Inci&s;ion incline a little from above outwards, and the Security of the Neighbouring Parts made it nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould do &s;o.</P>
<P>He continued to take Care that the <HI>Staff</HI> &s;hould not &s;lip from the Wound, and with his Fingers examined the Largene&s;s of it, feeling at the &s;ame Time for the naked <HI>Catheter,</HI> it he had any Su&s;picion that it was out of its Place; for it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Groove &s;hould be clo&s;e to the Inci&s;ion, that he might with the more Security thru&s;t the Male <HI>Conductor</HI> into it.</P>
<P>Therefore having again de&s;ired the Patient to lie &s;till, he took the Male <HI>Conductor</HI> into his Right Hand, and pu&s;hed it carefully and &s;teddily through the Wound towards the <HI>Catheter;</HI> and after &s;ome few Tryals, fixed it in the <HI>Sulcus</HI> without any thing being intercepted be|tween them, which it was ea&s;y to judge, both by the Re&s;i&s;tance and Hardne&s;s of the <HI>Staff.</HI></P>
<P>When he was a&s;&s;ured of this, he pu&s;hed the <HI>Conductor</HI> with more Force, and thru&s;t back the <HI>Staff,</HI> drawing the Handle of it gently to|wards him at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>By this Means the Convex Part of it retired from the Wound into the Cavity of the Bladder, and the <HI>Conductor</HI> remaining &s;till in the <HI>Sulcus</HI> was &s;afely guided thither likewi&s;e; and by moving it gently up and down, he di&s;covered either by its touching the naked <HI>Staff</HI> or the <HI>Stone,</HI> that it was really in the Cavity of the Bladder where he wanted it to be.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="85">
<P>The other Parts of this Operation were performed as by the great <HI>Apparatus;</HI> for with his Right Hand he kept the Male <HI>Conductor</HI> in the Bladder, and with his Left drew the <HI>Catheter</HI> out through the <HI>Urethra.</HI> Then he took the Male <HI>Conductor</HI> into his Left Hand, and upon that directed the Female into the Bladder with his Right; afterwards hold|ing the two <HI>Conductors</HI> at a &s;ufficient Di&s;tance with his Left Fingers, he thru&s;t the <HI>Forceps</HI> between them into the Bladder with his other Hand, and pre&s;ently drew out the Female <HI>Conductor.</HI></P>
<P>Then he felt with the <HI>Forceps</HI> for the <HI>Stone,</HI> that he might be &s;ure that In&s;trument had not mi&s;&s;ed its Way, but was really within the Bladder, and afterwards drew out his Male <HI>Conductor</HI> likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed to open the <HI>Forceps</HI> with a con&s;iderable Force &s;everal times to|gether, both to dilate the Wound and Bladder, and loo&s;en it as much as he could from the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>When this was done, he &s;earched for, laid hold of, and extracted the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>Forceps,</HI> with all the &s;ame Precautions which they com|monly do, and always ought to u&s;e, who perform this Operation by Cutting the <HI>Urethra</HI> in the <HI>Perinaeum.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as one <HI>Stone</HI> was taken out, he thru&s;t other In&s;truments into the Bladder, to di&s;cover if there were any more behind; and with a proper Scoop, and very often with his Fore-Finger, he brought away any &s;mall Bits of Stones, Sand or clotted Blood, and then the Patient was laid in a Bed upon his Back.</P>
<P>He put neither Tent, Plai&s;ter nor Bandage upon the Wound, but kept it open for &s;ome Days after the Operation; and in the mean time ordered the Patient as much Pti&s;ane or weak Emul&s;ion as he could drink; that the Urine flowing fir&s;t copiou&s;ly into the Bladder, might wa&s;h it throughly, and then running out at the Wound, might carry along with it the Sand, Blood, or whatever el&s;e might remain. After|wards he cured the Wound, as other fre&s;h Wounds u&s;ually are.</P>
<P>With how great Dexterity, and in how &s;hort a Time he always per|formed this Operation, there are innumerable Witne&s;&s;es to te&s;tify; a|mong whom I could name &s;everal Per&s;ons of Probity, Learning and Cha|racter, who are &s;till alive. How well and how &s;ucce&s;sfully he operated, the Event afterwards proved; for the far greate&s;t Part not only &s;urvived the Operation, and did very well after it, but recovered in an incredi|bly &s;hort Time &s;o perfectly, as never to be afflicted with a Fi&s;tula, invo|luntarily
<PB N="80" REF="86">Flux of Urine, Barrenne&s;s, or any other Accidents which &s;o oftend attend tho&s;e in whom the Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages have been Cut.</P>
<P>And tho' this Method may &s;eem more difficult to be put in Practice upon Women; yet even the&s;e he Cut the &s;ame Way, provided they were Maids, or had never had Children: neither are there In&s;tances wanting of his Succe&s;s among &s;uch as had.</P>
<P>This excellent Account has Dr. <HI>Albinus</HI> given us of <HI>Rau</HI>'s Method of Cutting for the <HI>Stone,</HI> in which he has omitted nothing that can any Way contribute to its being fully under&s;tood, if it is not that he has &s;et down no Ob&s;ervations made on the Bodies of &s;uch as died before the Wound was cured; by which we &s;hould have had a more certain Account of all the Parts cut, than is to be found in this Relation at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But now, if we compare a little this Method with all tho&s;e that went before it, it will be found to contain nothing of any Con&s;equence that can be called New, except the extraordinary Skill and Dexterity of the Operator, and his cautious, prudent and attentive Manner of Opera|ting. It is to the&s;e Things only, that is owing any Difference to be ob&s;erved in either his In&s;truments, or the &s;everal Steps of his Operation; which Differences de&s;erve not &s;o much to be call'd New Inventions, as the making the be&s;t U&s;e of what was already invented. The principal Thing wherein his Way of Cutting differs from that of <HI>Marianus,</HI> is in the Place in which he makes his Inci&s;ion; but this his Hi&s;torian owns to be the &s;ame with that where <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> made his; tho', as I have &s;ufficiently proved, that Monk's De&s;ign was to make it in another Place. Again, he differs from <HI>Frere Jacques</HI> Methods in the In&s;truments he u&s;es, and the manner of u&s;ing them; but all this he took from the great <HI>Apparatus,</HI> except the &s;trait <HI>Ro&s;trum</HI> of his <HI>Staff,</HI> as <HI>Mery</HI> had done be|fore him; tho' I do not think it at all probable that he had &s;een <HI>Mery</HI>'s Book, before he had compo&s;ed the Theory of his own Operation. Mr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s principal Merit therefore con&s;i&s;ts in having made a judicious Collection of the Parts of &s;everal Methods, which were attended with the greate&s;t Advantages and lea&s;t Inconveniencies, and framing the&s;e into one Regular Operation, which in his Hands has been perhaps more &s;ucce&s;sful than any hitherto di&s;covered; but whether it will continue &s;o to be, if brought into Practice a-new, mu&s;t be left to Experience and Time to determine.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Beginning of the foregoing Chapter, I ob&s;erved that tho' &s;e|veral Accounts of Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Rau</HI>'s Operation for the <HI>Stone</HI> have been publi&s;hed, and many more handed about by tho&s;e who pretend to have &s;een him Cut, yet they are all both imperfect and full of Mi&s;takes; and that it is entirely owing to the learned and accurate Dr. <HI>Albinus,</HI> that this great Man's Method was not for ever lo&s;t to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Doctor's Book was publi&s;hed at <HI>Leyden,</HI> he did me the Honour, among&s;t &s;everal of his ingenious Friends here in <HI>London,</HI> to &s;end it me in a Pre&s;ent; and at the next Meeting of the Royal Society, I thought proper to lay before them an Ab&s;tract in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of that Part of it which relates to Mr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s Operation for the <HI>Stone;</HI> together with &s;everal Preparations, from which I demon&s;trated and de&s;cribed the Parts concerned in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Preparations I have had now a good many Years by me: They make part of a compleat Collection that I have made, by which all the po&s;&s;ible Ways of getting in to the Humane Bladder, in order to extract a <HI>Stone,</HI> may with the greate&s;t Clearne&s;s be illu&s;trated; and the Advan|tages and Inconveniencies of each of them, as far as the&s;e depend on the Structure of the Parts, with the greate&s;t Certainty deter|mined.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Ways, I always reckoned that practis'd by Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Rau</HI> to be one, long before I had heard any thing of his true Method, or even, of that of <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> from which it is taken; and indeed, my Pre|parations will &s;erve to direct in every Step of his Operation, and point
<PB N="82" REF="88">out the Parts that are either to be Cut or avoided in it, as fully as if I had had <HI>Albinus</HI>'s Book before me when I went about them. And I will venture to &s;ay, that the Examination of &s;uch Preparations as the&s;e, when fre&s;h Subjects cannot be had, which every Surgeon and Anatomi&s;t mu&s;t know is too often the Ca&s;e with us, is the &s;ure&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Way to enable us to under&s;tand, and make the right U&s;e of what has been written upon the Subject of <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> which of late Years has made &s;o much Noi&s;e in our Phyi&s;ical World.</P>
<P>But to return from this &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion: If I may judge by the E|vent, what I then offered to the Royal Society was by many Members of that Honourable Body thought no un&s;uitable Entertainment for them; for from that Time &s;everal worthy Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, ha|ving carefully read <HI>Albinus</HI>'s Book, and examined my Preparations, be|gan to think &s;eriou&s;ly of introducing the Practice of it among&s;t us. And I mo&s;t willingly embrace this Opportunity of doing Ju&s;tice to the ingenious Dr. <HI>Bamber</HI> and Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden,</HI> by declaring in a publick manner, (what I had many Opportunities of knowing, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at mo&s;t of the Experiments they made on dead Bodies) that as it was their Turn to Cut in the two great Ho&s;pitals of this City the following Sea&s;on; I beheld with the utmo&s;t Plea&s;ure, the Alacrity, Indu&s;try and Application with which they &s;oon made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters, each in the Way that &s;uited his Genius be&s;t, of the true Method of performing an Operation, which they thought they had all the Rea&s;ons that Theory could furni&s;h, to prefer even to the high Way of Cutting, which both of them had for a con&s;iderable Time practis'd with great Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 7th Day of la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bamber</HI> made the fir&s;t Tryal of it on living Bodies in St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Ho&s;pital, and &s;ince that Time he has made &s;everal more. In all the&s;e Operations he has thought it proper to follow every Step of Mr. <HI>Rau</HI>'s Method, except that he filled the Bladder moderately with Water; and therefore, as his Dexterity and Skill in every Operation he goes about are &s;ufficiently known, there remains no more to be &s;aid about them; &s;ave only, that as far as can be judged from the Number he has Cut, his Succe&s;s is hitherto at lea&s;t equal to that of Mr. <HI>Rau.</HI></P>
<PB N="83" REF="89">
<P>Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> began to Cut in St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Ho&s;pital a few Days after Dr. <HI>Bamber;</HI> but as he has thought fit to vary Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Rau</HI>'s Me|thod con&s;iderably, I mu&s;t beg leave to in&s;i&s;t a little more on his Opera|tion.</P>
<P>I have already mention'd an Account of <HI>Rau</HI>'s Method given by Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden,</HI> in the Preface to his Treati&s;e on the High Operation for the <HI>Stone,</HI> publi&s;hed 1723, as he had received it from tho&s;e who had been Scholars to Mr. <HI>Rau,</HI> and &s;everal times pre&s;ent at his Operations. His Informations were indeed very lame and imperfect; but yet, even from the&s;e, he had conceived &s;o favourable an Idea of that Method, as to think it preferable either to that of <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> or <HI>Marianus;</HI> and withal, that it would be &s;till more &s;o, <HI>if the Bladder was fir&s;t filled with Water.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Albinus</HI>'s late Treati&s;e has, as I have already remarked, given this in|genious and mo&s;t expert Surgeon an Opportunity of examining the whole Matter with more Clearne&s;s and Certainty than he had done be|fore; and the Fruit of the Pains he has been at, is not only to confirm him in his former favourable Opinion of it, but al&s;o to bring it to &s;uch a degree of Perfection, as in his Judgment makes it preferable to all the Methods of Cutting that have ever been invented.</P>
<P>Now, as Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI>'s Method mu&s;t be reckon'd an Improvement of that fir&s;t attempted by <HI>Frere Jacques,</HI> a De&s;cription of it, &s;uch as a Spectator is able to give, does even upon that Account very well de&s;erve a Place in the Hi&s;tory I have ventured to write of the <HI>Lateral Operation for the Stone:</HI> And if, in what I &s;hall &s;ay about it, I &s;hall happen to mi|&s;take or omit any material Circum&s;tance, I wi&s;h that may &s;erve as an Inducement to the happy Improver to rectify and compleat whatever is ami&s;s or wanting in mine, by obliging the Publick him&s;elf with a more accurate and full Account of his own Operation.</P>
<P>The Table upon which the Patient is placed is highe&s;t at that End upon which his Buttocks re&s;t; and by means of a Pillow laid under him there, and another under his Head when he lies upon his Back, his Belly is lower than any other Part of his Body.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="90">
<P>His Buttocks are placed upon the Edge of the Table, and his Knees being &s;eparated from one another, and bent as much as they can be con|veniently, his Wri&s;ts and Ancles are tied together; and he is kept in that Situation by three A&s;&s;i&s;tants, One at each Leg, and a Third at his Head; who pre&s;&s;es with his two Hands upon the Patient's Shoulders, to keep him from retiring backward from the Operator.</P>
<P>The Patient being brought from his Bed in a Night-Gown, and &s;ituated in this Manner, the Operator thru&s;ts an hollow grooved Steel <HI>Catheter,</HI> through the <HI>Urethra</HI> into the Bladder; and with a Syringe mounted with an Ox's <HI>Ureter,</HI> injects as much warm Water into it as the Patient can bear without Pain, in the &s;ame Manner as is done in the High Operation. Into one Patient of about Eighteen Years of Age, and who had a Stone weighing Six Ounces and a Quarter, Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> injected Seven Ounces of Water; but he thinks the Quantity may always be determined by the Complaints of the Patient without ob&s;erving any other Rule.</P>
<P>When the Water is injected, and &s;ecured from running out, by tying round the <HI>Penis</HI> a narrow Slip of Flannel, he gives the End of the <HI>Ca|theter</HI> to an intelligent A&s;&s;i&s;tant to hold; who&s;e principal Care is to keep it from ri&s;ing, but not at all to direct the Groove to the Place where the Inci&s;ion is to be made, for a Rea&s;on that we &s;hall hear pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>Then the Operator having feared him&s;elf upon a Chair, the Heighth of which is &s;uitable to that of the Table on which the Patient is laid, takes a pointed Knife with a Convex Edge, and beginning about an Inch above the <HI>Anus,</HI> on the Left Side of the <HI>Raphe,</HI> between the <HI>Accelerator Urinae,</HI> or as I name that Mu&s;cle, <HI>Con&s;trictor Urethrae,</HI> and the <HI>Erector Penis,</HI> he makes an Inci&s;ion downwards by the Side of the <HI>Sphincter Ani,</HI> a little obliquely outwards as it de&s;cends from Two and an Half to Four Inches in Length, according to the Age of the Patient, or Size and Structure of the Parts. This fir&s;t Inci&s;ion he en|deavours to make all at one Stroke, &s;o as to cut through the Skin, Fat and all, or Part of the <HI>Levator A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i,</HI> which lies in his Way.</P>
<PB N="85" REF="91">
<P>As &s;oon as this is done, he thru&s;ts the Fore-Finger of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> into the Middle of the Wound, in order to pre&s;s the <HI>Inte&s;tinum Rectum</HI> to one Side, that it may be in le&s;s Danger of being Cut; and taking a crooked Knife in his other Hand, with the Edge on the Concave Side, he thru&s;ts the Point of it through the Wound clo&s;e by his Finger into the Bladder, between the <HI>Ve&s;icula Seminalis</HI> and <HI>Os I&s;chium</HI> of the &s;ame Side; then lowering his Hand, he continues this &s;econd Inci&s;ion up|wards, till the Point of his Knife comes out at the upper Part of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>This Inci&s;ion being fini&s;hed, he thru&s;ts the Fore-Finger of his Left Hand through the Wound into the Cavity of the Bladder; and having f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lt. It and &s;ecured the <HI>Stone,</HI> he introduces his <HI>Forceps</HI> upon his Finger, and endeavours to lay fa&s;t hold of the <HI>Stone</HI> with it; then he pulls out his Finger, and taking the <HI>Forceps</HI> in both Hands, he extracts the <HI>Stone</HI> with greater or le&s;s Facility, according to the Size thereof, or Largene&s;s of the Wound he has made.</P>
<P>If there are more <HI>Stones</HI> than one, he feels for the re&s;t with his Finger, then introduces his <HI>Forceps,</HI> and extracts them in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>During the whole Operation, the <HI>Catheter</HI> remains in the Bladder; and all that the A&s;&s;i&s;tant who holds it has to mind is, as has been al|ready &s;aid, to keep it from ri&s;ing. By this means Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> thinks the Bladder is pre&s;&s;ed down &s;ufficiently to facilitate the Entry of the <HI>Forceps</HI> upon his Finger without the U&s;e of any Director; and it being filled with Water, there is no occa&s;ion to Cut upon a <HI>Groove;</HI> neither is there any danger of laying hold of the <HI>Catheter</HI> with the <HI>Forceps,</HI> if due Care is taken to manage that rightly after it is in the Bladder.</P>
<P>In this Method of Operating there are but one or two Arterial Branches cut, from which there is any Danger of an Haemorrhagy, and not always from them neither: However, if after the Wound is well clean&s;ed and wa&s;hed with a wetted Spunge, any Quantity of Blood continues to run, he ties the Ve&s;&s;els immediately; and then having ap|plied Pledgets of dry Lint and other proper Dre&s;&s;ings, the Patient is af|terwards carried to Bed.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="92">
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> regular Method of Cutting; and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Accident happens, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to be aware of be|fore the Operation, he has been &s;eldom above a Minute (&s;ometimes le&s;s) between the Beginning of the fir&s;t Inci&s;ion and Extraction of the <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>There are Circum&s;tances, however, in which he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ary &s;ome Steps of his Method. The&s;e, as far as I have been Witne&s;s to, or can remember them, are as follows:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, When having laid hold of the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>Forceps,</HI> he finds by the Force it takes to draw it out, or other Signs, that it is very large, rather than expo&s;e the Patient to the Danger and Pain of a violent Di|aceration of the Parts, he chu&s;es either with a Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars, if it is the upper Part, or his Knife if the lower, to enlarge the Wound by an additional Inci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, If after the &s;econd Inci&s;ion is made, he finds by the Finger which he endeavours to thru&s;t into the Bladder, that the <HI>Catheter</HI> has &s;lip'd into the Wound, which, by the &s;training of the Patient and other Accidents, &s;ometimes happens; then he withdraws his Finger, and in&s;tead thereof thru&s;ts a <HI>Gorgeret</HI> into the <HI>Groove</HI> of the <HI>Catheter,</HI> upon which he introduces his <HI>Forceps</HI> in the ordinary Manner. It is only with a View to this Accident, that he prefers a grooved <HI>Catheter</HI> to one entirely round, &s;uch as was u&s;ed by <HI>Frere Jacques.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, When the A&s;&s;i&s;tant, who holds the <HI>Catheter,</HI> gives him any ground to think that he his laid hold of that with the <HI>Forceps</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Stone;</HI> which, tho' he believes it will rarely happen, yet is not im|po&s;&s;ible; be orders it immediately to be pulled out, and then endeavours to lay hold of and extract the <HI>Stone</HI> without that Conveniency which the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ing down of the Bladder would afford him, if he &s;hould be obliged to introduce his <HI>Forceps</HI> oftner than once.</P>
<P>Fourthly, When by the Smallne&s;s or Situation of the <HI>Stone,</HI> he finds this Method to be ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> or more &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">fe, he thru&s;ts his Fingers into the <HI>Anus;</HI> and having pre&s;s'd the <HI>Stone</HI> towards the Orifice of the Wound,
<PB N="87" REF="93">he pulls it out with his other Hand, without u&s;ing any <HI>Forceps</HI> at all.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, When he feels, either by his Finger, or the Re&s;i&s;tance the <HI>Stone</HI> makes to the Force with which he &s;trives to draw it out, that there is any kind of Con&s;triction, either of the Ureters or Membranes of the Bladder about it, he endeavours by thru&s;ting his Fingers into the <HI>Anus,</HI> or other proper Methods, to bring that Part near the Orifice of the Wound; and then with his Knife he cuts the&s;e Membranes which had formed the <HI>Sphincter;</HI> and thus the <HI>Stone</HI> being di&s;engaged is extracted with the greate&s;t Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As I have here de&s;cribed Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI>'s new Operation nearly in the &s;ame Order that <HI>Albinus</HI> has followed in that of Mr. <HI>Rau,</HI> it will be ea&s;y for the Reader to perceive what Additions or Alterations are owing to him, or, in one Word, what Improvements he has made; &s;o that it would be altogether &s;uperfluous to lengthen this <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript</HI> any further, by comparing them together.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> has hitherto Cut but Seven Patients this Way that I know of; and whoever has heard of the wonderful Succe&s;s which at|tended his Practice of the High Operation, will have but little room to doubt of the happy Event of his pre&s;ent Method, in which even the&s;e fir&s;t Tryals have &s;ucceeded equally, if not beyond whatever he could boa&s;t of in the former.</P>
<P>To conclude: Were I not afraid of being thought to pa&s;s the Bounds I pre&s;cribed to my &s;elf in this Hi&s;tory, of only relating and comparing Facts together, without interpo&s;ing my own Judgment, I might add, that in my Opinion there is nothing wanting in Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI>'s Method of performing the <HI>Lateral Operation,</HI> by which it can in any re&s;pect be improved, except the U&s;e of crooked <HI>Forceps</HI> upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions; for I have frequently ob&s;erved at both Ho&s;pitals, that the <HI>Stone</HI> is much more ea&s;ily extracted, when it lies on that Side of the Bladder in which the Inci&s;ion is made, then when it lies on the other, e&s;pecially if the Cavity to be ob&s;erved there, is of a preternatural Depth or Breadth, as it &s;ometimes happens. Therefore when this is the Ca&s;e, I am of Opinion that if the <HI>For|ceps</HI> were a little crooked, the <HI>Stone</HI> might with le&s;s Difficulty be laid
<PB N="88" REF="94">hold of, than by the &s;trait ones which have been hitherto u&s;ed. It is true, that crooked <HI>Forceps</HI> will be weaker than the others; but the dif|ference in Strength would be more than compen&s;ated by the Facility of charging the <HI>Stone;</HI> becau&s;e in this, rather than in the Force nece&s;&s;ary to extract it when laid hold of, the Inconveniency I am talking about &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
