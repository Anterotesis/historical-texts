<P>THE medicinal education of children, which is commonly managed with &s;uch negligence, is however, of very great importance, and the faults that may be committed in it are attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. Children like dough, are &s;u&s;ceptible of all impre&s;&s;ions, and an infant well formed at its birth, may become weak, and &s;ickly, thro' the improper management of the nur&s;e, to who&s;e care it is committed: and on the con|trary, the mo&s;t tender and &s;ickly infant may become &s;trong and robu&s;t, by a care|ful attention to the rules laid down in this Pamphlet. Several years practice in this par|ticular branch of medicine, has enabled me to make the&s;e ob&s;ervations, &s;o that I have a&s;&s;erted nothing but what is agreeable to rea&s;on, and confirmed to me by repeated experience: I have al&s;o, with great pains and attention, &s;tudied all the authors, who
<PB REF="3">have profe&s;&s;edly written on this &s;ubject, and have collected together in this treati&s;e, all the u&s;eful precepts, both with re&s;pect to the nur&s;ing, and the treatment of the di&s;|ea&s;es of children, which are &s;cattered in their different works; and have endeavour|ed to expo&s;e tho&s;e cu&s;toms which are evi|dently founded on ab&s;urd and dangerous prejudices. This &s;mall tract will, per|haps, appear contemptible, to tho&s;e who judge of the worth of books by their bulk; but I doubt not, experience will teach its value, to mothers and nur&s;es, and that the peru&s;al will not in the lea&s;t injure, if it does not improve, the more learned and expe|rienced.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Ligature of the Navel String, and the Evacuation of the fir&s;t Excrements called the Meconium.</HEAD>
<P>THE tying of the navel-&s;tring is the fir&s;t operation performed on the new born infant, it is done with common thread &s;everal times doubled, turned two or three times round the navel-&s;tring, and tied at the di&s;tance of about two or three inches
<PB N="2" REF="6" MS="y">from the navel, in order to prevent a fatal hemorrhage from this part; at the end which is left, there is applied a &s;mall compre&s;s of fine linnen, which is kept in its place by a &s;light bandage.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of children, at their birth, is covered over with a whiti&s;h, vi&s;cid liquor, this is ea&s;ily removed by wa&s;hing the child with a little wine, mixed with warm water; this lotion is al&s;o a remedy for inflammations of the &s;kin, which are common at this time, as it augments the motion of the humours, and di&s;&s;ipates the bad effects of the air. The &s;ame intention is an&s;wered by &s;haking, extending, and bending, the different mem|bers of the infant, by &s;lightly rubbing the belly, and by gently irritating the organs of &s;en&s;ation, by which means the ob&s;tructions formed in the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin are removed, and the mucous juices that are found in all the joints, are attenuated.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach and inte&s;tines of the infant are full of a vi&s;cid matter, which is called the meconium, the fir&s;t intention is to clean&s;e the child of this, before food, in any quantity, is to be given: for nature, which is always the be&s;t director, does not provide any till &s;ome days after its birth are expired. Re&s;t, which at this time is the chief nou|ri&s;hment of the child, and the proper di&s;|charge of this excrement, are the principal
<PB N="3" REF="7" MS="y">matters to be regarded for a few days. To promote this end, the general practice of nur&s;es is to cram a dab of butter and &s;ugar down the infant's throat, or &s;ome &s;uch un|whole&s;ome me&s;s: it is the cu&s;tom of &s;ome to give a little bit of fat roa&s;t pig, with an in|tention to cure it of its mother's longings, &s;o that from this prepo&s;terous management, the child runs the ri&s;k of being made &s;ick from the very fir&s;t hour. In the room of the&s;e ab&s;urd methods, to encourage the clean&s;ing of the child, a tea &s;poonful of &s;olutive &s;yrup of ro&s;es, or &s;yrup of violets, with an equal quantity of oil of &s;weet al|monds, mixed together, may be now and then given: the pap &s;hould be made very thin, and given in &s;mall quantities, for if much be given before this excrement is evacuated, they will ferment together and occa&s;ion pain, and the tender body of the infant not being able to bear it, is flung into convul&s;ions, and for want of attending &s;uffi|ciently to this circum&s;tance, abundance of children have lo&s;t their lives.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Examination of the Bridle of the Tongue, and of the time when the Child ought to take the fir&s;t Aliments.</HEAD>
<P>THE child makes known by the motion of its lips, when it wants &s;ome nouri&s;hment, it &s;ucks its own glands, and draws &s;pittle from them, which it either &s;wallows or rejects, by putting it in foam out of its mouth; if any one pre&s;ents a finger, it &s;eizes it, rolls it in its mouth, and by the&s;e &s;igns demands the nipple; but before it be given, it is not &s;ufficient to teach it by little and little to &s;eize it as it ought, we mu&s;t al&s;o examine if the child is not hindered by &s;ome fault in the for|mation of its tongue. The tongue is &s;ome|times &s;o clo&s;ely tied to the lower part of the mouth, by the means of the bridle, that it is obliged to be cut; this is u&s;ually done by nur&s;es and midwives with the nail, but as this method is frequently attended with bad con&s;equences, I would recommend rather the cutting it with a &s;harp pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. But the bridle of the tongue very &s;eldom requires this operation, for it ought never to be cut, except when it is extended almo&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="9" MS="y">to the very tip of the tongue, which is very uncommon.</P>
<P>As to the time when the child ought to take nouri&s;hment, it is very difficult to give certain and invariable rules on this &s;ubject: however, it is natural to believe that follow|ing an exact method in relation to &s;uckling of children, or giving them any other kind of nouri&s;hment, will not meet with un&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacles, and it would be very u&s;eful if mothers would give them&s;elves the trouble to put it in practice, and determine not to be di&s;couraged at the beginning: tho&s;e nur&s;es, or mothers, cannot be &s;ufficiently blamed who perpetually incite their children to &s;wallow down milk, or any other kind of food, under pretence that they have warm &s;tomachs, and an ea&s;y dige&s;tion; that they want them to grow and look fat, and that good milk can do them no hurt, without con&s;idering whether the&s;e exce&s;&s;es are fol|lowed by vomiting, a loo&s;ene&s;s, the gripes or convul&s;ions: the weaker and more delicate the &s;tomach of the infant is, the greater precaution &s;hould be taken not to over|load it, and it ought to be allowed the more time to dige&s;t the nouri&s;hment it contains. Tho&s;e who would not have children voracious, &s;ubject, to a vomiting and loo&s;ene&s;s, to breakings out and ether di&s;orders, ought, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to pre|&s;cribe
<PB N="6" REF="10" MS="y">a fixed rule for the time when infants are to be fed, and for the quantity of ali|ments nece&s;&s;ary for them. Their dige&s;tion would be more perfect, and their health more &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;hed, were parents con|tented with giving them their nouri&s;hment, five or &s;ix times in the twenty four hours, a &s;mall quantity at each time, and always at the &s;ame hour, or as near as po&s;&s;ible; this method &s;hould be ob&s;erved about a twelve|month, when, and not before, the child ought to be weaned, not all at once, but by degrees that it may neither feel, nor fret at, the want of the brea&s;t. Were this plan of nur&s;ing &s;trictly followed, the children kept clean and &s;weet, tumbled and to&s;t about a good deal, I am certain that in &s;ix or eight months time, mo&s;t children would become health|ful and &s;trong, would readily find the u&s;e of their legs, and very &s;oon &s;hift for them|&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Dre&s;s mo&s;t proper for new born Children, and &s;ome remarks on the errors, in the common method of nur&s;ing.</HEAD>
<P>THE ingenious Dr. Cadogan ob&s;erves, that there needs no other proof of the impropriety of the pre&s;ent method of bring|ing up children, as practi&s;ed by nur&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than the frequent mi&s;carriages attending it. Children in general are over cloathed and over fed: to the&s;e cau&s;es the doctor imputes almo&s;t all their di&s;ea&s;es, the fir&s;t great mi&s;take is that they think a new born infant cannot be kept too warm; from this pre|judice, they load and bind it with flannels, wrappers, &s;tays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are all together almo&s;t equal to its own weight, by which means a healthy child is made &s;o tender and chilly, that if by any accident a door or window be left open, the child often catches an irrecoverable cold, and what is &s;till more ab&s;urd, at the end of the month, is &s;ent into the country to be nur&s;ed, in a leaky hou&s;e, that lets in wind and rain from every quarter. Can it be any wonder the child never thrives afterwards? But be&s;ides the mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from the heat and weight of the&s;e &s;wadling cloaths, they are too often put on &s;o tight,
<PB N="8" REF="12" MS="y">and the child is &s;o crampt by them, that its bowels have not room to act and exert them|&s;elves in the free ea&s;y manner they ought, this is a very hurtful circum&s;tance, for limbs that are not u&s;ed, will never be &s;trong, and &s;uch tender bodies cannot bear much pre&s;&s;ure, the circulation hindered by the compre&s;&s;ion of any one part, mu&s;t produce unnatural &s;wellings in &s;ome other, to which without doubt the many di&s;tortions and deformities we every where meet with are owing. A new born child cannot be well too cool and loo&s;e in its dre&s;s, it even wants le&s;s cloathing in proportion than a grown per&s;on, for children are capable of bearing great hard&s;hips before they are made &s;ickly, by the mi&s;taken management of their nur&s;es, witne&s;s the many foundlings picked up daily in the &s;treets of London, and the many in&s;tances, both antient and modern, of infants expo&s;ed, and de&s;erted, which have neverthele&s;s lived &s;everal days, tho' ex|po&s;ed to the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I would recommend the following dre&s;s. A flannel wai&s;tcoat without &s;leeves, made to fit the body, and tie loo&s;ely behind, to which there &s;hould be a petticoat &s;ewed, and over this a kind of gown of the &s;ame materials, or any other that is light, thin and flim&s;y. The petticoat &s;hould not be
<PB N="9" REF="13" MS="y">quite &s;o long as the child, the gown a few inches longer, with one cap only on the head, which may be made double if it be not thought warm enough; what I mean is, that the whole head-dre&s;s &s;hould be &s;o con|trived, that it may be put on at once, and neither bind or pre&s;s the head at all; the linnen may be the &s;ame as u&s;ual. This I think, would be abundantly &s;ufficient for the day, laying a&s;ide all tho&s;e &s;wathes, bandages, &s;tays, and contrivances, that are mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly u&s;ed to clo&s;e, and keep the head in its place, and &s;upport the body; as if nature had produced her chief work, a human creature, &s;o carele&s;sly unfini&s;hed, as to want tho&s;e idle aids to make it perfect. Shoes and &s;tockings are not in the lea&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary till the child is able to run about, for they keep the legs wet, and na&s;ty, if they are not changed almo&s;t every hour, and often cramp and hurt the feet, be&s;ides, a child would &s;tand firmer, and learn to walk much &s;ooner without them. The child &s;hould wear a thin flannel &s;hirt during the night, which ought to be every way quite loo&s;e: Children in this &s;imple, loo&s;e, dre&s;s, which may be ea&s;ily put on and off, without much trouble, would be infinitely ea&s;ier, and en|joy a much freer u&s;e of their limbs, than when they are loaded, as is too frequently practi&s;ed, with wrappers, &s;tays, &s;wathes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="14" MS="y">
<P>Nur&s;es entertain a &s;trange opinion about changing the linnen, and keeping the children clean. They fooli&s;hly imagine, that clean linnen, and fre&s;h cloaths, draw away and rob them of their nouri&s;hment; on the contrary, they do nothing more than imbibe a little of that moi&s;ture, which their bodies exhale, which is of &s;ervice to them, and therefore their linnen cannot be changed too often, it &s;hould be con&s;tantly clean eve|ry day, as it would free them from &s;tinks, and acidities, which are not only offen&s;ive, but prejudicial to the tender &s;tate of infancy. Every mother who is able, ought to &s;uckle her own child, &s;ince it is not only more beneficial to the child, but al&s;o conducive to her own health, &s;ince forcing back the milk, which mo&s;t young women have in great plenty, &s;ometimes endangers life, and often lays the foundation of many incurable di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>But if from a bad habit of body, want of a &s;ufficient quantity of milk, or any other cau&s;e, the mother is incapable of &s;uckling her child, it will be infinitely bet|ter to procure a wet-nur&s;e, than to attempt to rear the infant by dry-nur&s;ing, &s;ince not above one in three of the children attempt|ed to be brought up, by this unnatural and dangerous method, ever &s;urvive it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="11" REF="15" MS="y">
<HEAD>Rules proper to be ob&s;erved in the choice of a Wet-Nur&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>CARE &s;hould be taken to chu&s;e a healthy woman, not more than thirty years of age, who has already &s;uckled one child, and who has not lain-in above two or three months, and has plenty of good milk, which is judged to be &s;o, when it is white, full of cream, &s;weet, and of a moderate con&s;i&s;t|ence; if it be too wheyey or thick, yellow|i&s;h, &s;alt, hot, or but in a &s;mall quantity, it is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to think it bad, and on that account to reject: the nur&s;e. The trials commonly made to determine the quality of the milk, are ta&s;ting it, and let|ting a drop fall into the eyes, when, if it makes the eyes &s;mart, or does not leave a &s;weetne&s;s on the tongue, it is good for no|thing. We judge of its con&s;i&s;tence by the &s;ight, or letting a little of it run into the palm of the hand, and then &s;troking the other hand upon it, by which it is ea&s;ily known whether the milk is of a proper con&s;i&s;tence. Great regard &s;hould be paid to the diet of the nur&s;e: &s;he ought to be very &s;ober and temperate; &s;he &s;hould eat one hearty meal of fle&s;h-meat, with a good deal of garden-&s;tuff and bread, every day, broth, milk, tea, or chocolate, are be&s;t for
<PB N="12" REF="16" MS="y">her breakfa&s;t. Her drink &s;hould be &s;mall-beer, or milk and water; wine and &s;trong-beer &s;hould be carefully avoided, &s;ince giv|ing &s;pirituous liquors to a nur&s;e, is, in reali|ty, giving them to the child, the con&s;e|quence of which may be ea&s;ily fore&s;een. Tho' moderate exerci&s;e is, in general, u&s;e|ful in pre&s;erving the health of nur&s;es, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to lay down general rules on this &s;ubject, as we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, in this ca&s;e, comply with their u&s;ual cu&s;tom and di&s;po&s;ition. It is commonly thought, that long &s;leep is advantageous, and can never be prejudicial; but this opinion is wrongly founded, &s;ince too long &s;leep is &s;ucceeded by heavine&s;s, &s;tupidity, and me|lancholy, whereas vivacity, and gaiety of di&s;po&s;ition, are qualities con&s;tantly required in nur&s;es, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to find in a woman who &s;leeps twelve or fourteen hours every night.</P>
<P>Another error is, that nur&s;es &s;hould be ab&s;olutely deprived of the conjugal embraces of their hu&s;bands, le&s;t they &s;hould become pregnant, and the infant, &s;uck bad milk; but &s;ince medicinal ob&s;ervations prove, that the fru&s;trating this appetite is attended often with dangerous con&s;equences, and I do not believe, that its being moderately gratified, has been ever attended with the lea&s;t in|convenience, with re&s;pect to health; I &s;ee
<PB N="13" REF="17" MS="y">no rea&s;on for forbidding nur&s;es the compa|ny of their hu&s;bands, provided that the nur&s;e is changed, if &s;he &s;hould prove with child.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the mo&s;t proper Diet, and the Rules nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in Weaning of Children.</HEAD>
<P>THE food of infants on their being weaned, ought certainly to be propor|tioned to the weakne&s;s of their dige&s;tive organs, contrary to the opinion of Mr. Locke, who advi&s;es children to be ac|cu&s;tomed to the coar&s;e&s;t aliments, but the inconveniences, and danger attending this method are very evident, &s;ince indige&s;tions, and all the di&s;orders ari&s;ing from them, threaten the infant who is fed with nouri&s;h|ment, which its weak &s;tomach cannot thoroughly dige&s;t, &s;ince the dige&s;tive power is very weak in young children. Their principal nouri&s;hment at fir&s;t &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of broths, but little &s;ea&s;oned, of the be&s;t white bread well baked, of rice gruel, barley broth, water-gruel, panada, or pap made with bread in&s;tead of flower: baked
<PB N="14" REF="18" MS="y">apples, pears, cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this permi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t not extend to plums, apricots, peaches, figs, melons, almonds and nuts, which are by repeated ob&s;ervations, found to be very pernicious; they may be allowed bread and butter, now and then, provided the butter be quite &s;weet and fre&s;h, and all the produce of the kitchen garden, for all the&s;e things are whole&s;ome and good for them, not|with&s;tanding the common notion of their being windy, which they are only to &s;tomachs who&s;e tone is &s;poilt by the u&s;e of high &s;ea&s;oned &s;auces, ragouts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The child &s;hould be weaned when about a twelvemonth old, which the nur&s;e &s;hould do by rubbing her nipple with a little aloes, or any other bitter, or drug, which has a &s;trong di&s;agreeable &s;mell, this di&s;gu&s;ts the infant, who cries, is unea&s;y, and frets at the lo&s;s of a food he has &s;o long been u&s;ed to. The nur&s;e mu&s;t be careful not to let the unea&s;ine&s;s of the child prevail on her to change her re&s;olution, and give the child the brea&s;t again, for the di&s;po&s;ition of body contracted from hunger, fretting, and crying, will hinder the child from properly dige&s;ting the milk, and a vomiting, and trouble&s;ome loo&s;ene&s;s will certainly en&s;ue. The child at fir&s;t &s;hould not be too often fed, nor too much food given it at once, the mo&s;t proper nouri&s;hment will be panada, or rice gruel,
<PB N="15" REF="19" MS="y">&s;ince the &s;ame ill con&s;equences will attend feeding the child too much, as we ob&s;erved would follow the mi&s;guided tenderne&s;s of the nur&s;e, in giving &s;uck to children, whom they have begun to wean. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to u&s;e too much precaution in bringing the &s;tomach to loo&s;e its habit of dige&s;ting no|thing but milk, the u&s;e of which &s;hould always be in&s;en&s;ibly left off: from milk the child &s;hould pa&s;s to panada, rice-gruel, or water gruel, from the&s;e to broths, and meat by degrees. A mixture ought never to be made of nouri&s;hments that are not of the &s;ame nature, and of an equal con&s;i&s;tence, and particularly nur&s;es ought to ob&s;erve, not to give the infant more &s;olid food, than can &s;upply by its nutritious particles, the place of the milk it took before. The leanne&s;s which accompanies the weaning of children is a &s;alutary change, it is the effect of the emptying of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, filled with a milky juice, that is to give place to a more nouri&s;hing lymph of another nature, and a more &s;olid con&s;i&s;tence; rea&s;on therefore, here agrees with experience, in convincing us that we are to blame to con&s;ider the &s;tate of tho&s;e infants as fatal and dangerous, who become le&s;s plump after their being weaned, &s;ince mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es children are &s;ubject to at the time of their being weaned, are owing to the too great quantity of food
<PB N="16" REF="20" MS="y">given them on their being deprived of milk. A loo&s;ene&s;s, and feveri&s;h di&s;orders in young children, are thought to require the u&s;e of opiates, but where they proceed from weaning, the u&s;e of &s;yrup of diacodion, and other narcotics, cannot be too much con|demned, as the diet alone, when properly managed, is mo&s;t u&s;eful for the different di&s;orders that happen to infants when they are weaned, for the &s;curfs, &s;cabs, and other di&s;orders that then ari&s;e, will di&s;appear of them&s;elves, if the nur&s;e has patience to wait for it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Cutting the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the fifth or &s;ixth month after the birth, the cutting of the teeth is plainly di&s;covered by the mouth of the infant being overflowed with &s;pittle. Their gums &s;well, grow red, and inflamed, cau&s;ed by the growing up of the teeth, which it is nece&s;&s;ary to favour, by le&s;&s;ening the re&s;i&s;tance of the gums, which oppo&s;e their ri&s;ing up; it is right therefore to compre&s;s the gums again&s;t the teeth, which are to pa&s;s through them, to do which the nur&s;e &s;hould pa&s;s and

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> On the Di&s;ea&s;es of Children in General.</HEAD>
<P>CHILDREN are &s;ubject to many di&s;ea&s;es, peculiar to the &s;tate of infancy, be&s;ides tho&s;e they are liable to in common with grown per&s;ons, and whoever examines with attention, tho&s;e &s;ymptoms in children, which plainly occur to the &s;en&s;es, and compares them with the &s;implicity of their diet, and the extreme delicacy of their con|&s;titution, will find that the method of treating the di&s;orders of children with propriety, is by no means &s;o difficult as is commonly imagined, for the di&s;ea&s;es of infancy are few in their kind, and differ only in degree from one another. If we con&s;ider the nature of the fluids in children, we &s;hall find that they never degenerate from their natural &s;tate, into any thing el&s;e than an acid acrimony, for whatever di&s;order they labour under, their excrements have almo&s;t always a &s;our &s;mell, and the &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of
<PB N="19" REF="23" MS="y">their belchings, in &s;hort all the complaints of infants &s;pring from an acid cau&s;e. But little can be learnt in the di&s;ea&s;es of infants from their pul&s;e, or urine, our whole in|telligence mu&s;t proceed from the nur&s;e; who can ea&s;ily tell whether the child has been troubled with a vomiting, with re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, pains in the belly, &s;our belchings, hiccups, or cough, whether they are co&s;tive or loo&s;e, the colour of their &s;tools, whether white, green, or bilious, whether they are remarkably thir&s;ty, and con&s;equently feveri&s;h, whether they have the thru&s;h, or convul&s;ions in any part of their bodies, whether there appears any &s;welling in their belly, or any other part, whether they have any eruptions, or &s;pots on the &s;kin, or whether the &s;kin is yellowi&s;h, or red. The&s;e enquiries are in general &s;ufficient to enable the per&s;ons who have the care of children to pre&s;cribe for them with &s;ucce&s;s, for with re&s;pect to the pul&s;e, it is in children naturally &s;o very quick and &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;turbed by the mo&s;t trifling accident, that per&s;ons unacquainted with this circum|&s;tance, would think them always in a fever. Be&s;ides children when &s;ick are &s;o peevi&s;h, and fretful, that &s;carce any of them can be prevailed on to hold their arm &s;teady, long enough for a phy&s;ician to feel their pul&s;e, in &s;hort &s;o many accidents quicken or di&s;turb the circulation of the blood in young
<PB N="20" REF="24" MS="y">children, that the judgement from their pul&s;e is too precarious, to be in any re&s;pect depended upon. Nor can any thing more certain be gathered from their urine, be|cau&s;e in children in health, it is always very thick, &s;o that any ignorant per&s;on upon in|&s;pecting it, would be apt to &s;u&s;pect the child to be very much di&s;ordered, while on the contrary he enjoys a perfect, &s;tate of health, be&s;ides the urine of children is &s;eldom to be examined, unmixed with the excrements. The cau&s;es which immediately relate to the production of childrens di&s;ea&s;es may be referred to the following heads, 1&s;t. to cold, 2dly. to thick milk, 3dly. to allow|ing them too early to eat meat, 4thly. to giving them &s;pirituous liquors: Cold catched in the evening, is certainly the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e feveri&s;h indi&s;po&s;itions, with which children are &s;o often afflicted, therefore proper care &s;hould be taken, to provide children with cloaths &s;ufficiently warm, &s;uitable to their age, to defend them from the injuries of the air. Too thick milk may be occa&s;ioned from many different cau&s;es, but this vitious quality of the milk from whatever cau&s;e it ari&s;es, mu&s;t produce many bad effects, and inevitably lay the foundation of fatal ob&s;tructions. Per&s;ons of all ages &s;hould be careful with regard to their diet, but the diet of infants, &s;hould
<PB N="21" REF="25" MS="y">be managed with the greate&s;t caution, be|cau&s;e they mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;uffer from errors of this kind, and want &s;trength, to re&s;i&s;t their pernicious con&s;equences, the u&s;ing children too &s;oon to eat fle&s;h, is the cau&s;e of tho&s;e indige&s;tions, which con&s;tantly attend that voracious age, and if their food be crude, and hard to be dige&s;ted, their humours mu&s;t likewi&s;e be crude, from whence not only worms will be bred, but a variety al&s;o of perplexing, and untoward &s;ymptoms, under which they frequently pine and langui&s;h. Wine and &s;pirituous liquors are &s;erviceable to old people, to &s;upply the natu|ral warmth, which is always languid in that &s;tate of life, but on this very account, mu&s;t be prejudicial to children, &s;ince they are much warmer than grown per&s;ons, and every kind of &s;pirituous liquor, vitiates the tone of their &s;tomach, &s;poils their appetite, burns up their nerves, and de&s;troys their delicate &s;tructure, by continual feveri&s;h heats.</P>
<P>To lay a rational foundation for the cure of the di&s;ea&s;es incident to infants, the tenderne&s;s and weakne&s;s of their con&s;titution mu&s;t be con&s;idered, and to the&s;e the medi|cines mu&s;t carefully be adapted, the milder the remedies made u&s;e of, the greater the probability of &s;ucce&s;s, for as their diet is &s;imple, &s;o ought their medicines to be &s;imple too, it has been already ob&s;erved that mo&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="26" MS="y">of their di&s;orders ari&s;e from acidity, the method of cure therefore depends entirely on removing this cau&s;e, which is effected by giving them te&s;taceous powders, &s;uch as prepared oy&s;ter &s;hells, prepared coral, and the like, which are of a perfectly mild nature, and efficaciou&s;ly ab&s;orb any prevalent acidity, they are al&s;o anodines, and never fail to give ea&s;e to children, when griped, much more certainly than the &s;yrup of white poppies or diacodion, which tho' &s;o often advi&s;ed by old nur&s;es, can never be given with &s;afety; the only inconvenience attend|ing the free u&s;e of the&s;e te&s;taceous powders, is that they are apt to occa&s;ion a co&s;tivene&s;s, which is always prejudicial to young chil|dren, the u&s;e of them therefore requires every now and then, a little manna, or a &s;ew grains of rhubarb, which is particularly &s;uited to childrens con&s;titutions, for it gently and &s;afely evacuates the febrific matter, purges the &s;tomach and whole body, of any vitiated humours, and re&s;tores the tone of the bowels; but perhaps no other remedy, is equal to a fine in&s;ipid powder, called Magne&s;ia Alba, which at the &s;ame time, that it corrects, and &s;weetens all acidities, even more effectually than the te&s;taceous powders, is likewi&s;e a very gentle purgative, and keeps the body moderately open without
<PB N="23" REF="27" MS="y">any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance: It may be given children from a &s;cruple to a quarter of an ounce in a day, a little at a time in all their food, till the acidities are quite de&s;troyed, and the di&s;orders ari&s;ing therefrom entirely removed, it has been very frequently admini&s;tred with &s;urprizing benefit, even when children have been reduced to the la&s;t extremity, by di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from acidities, and may be ea&s;ily procured at almo&s;t every apothecaries &s;hop, at a very moderate price.</P>
