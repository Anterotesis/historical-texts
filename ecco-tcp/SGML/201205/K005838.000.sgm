<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD long &s;u&s;pected that the Peruvian Bark in common u&s;e, was very inferior in power and efficacy to that recommended by the early writers on the &s;ubject; but, more e&s;pecially by our countrymen, <HI>MORTON</HI> and <HI>SYDENHAM,</HI> in who&s;e works the medical virtues of this Drug, in Intermittent and other Fevers are extolled as little &s;hort of infallibility. In their time the Quill Bark was not mentioned; their cotemporary writers on the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> evidently de&s;cribe the Peruvian Bark of that period, as of a larger kind, of more com|pact pieces, and of the colour of the ru&s;t of <HI>Iron,</HI> which marks are very expre&s;&s;ive of the <HI>Red Bark,;</HI> the in|nermo&s;t coat of which has an <HI>ochry</HI> appearance, and its re&s;inous or middle layer re&s;embles very much the <HI>La|pis Haematitis.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortex cra&s;&s;itie mediocri, foras &s;caber, paululum cane&s;cens, aliquando mu&s;co obductus, intus laevis, coloris ferruginei, &s;apo|ris acris at inten&s;e amari.

<P>Mr. SPRINGALL of <HI>Thames Street,</HI> (who&s;e Uncle was, in the the year 1702, with SIR GEORGE ROOKE, at the taking of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleons, in the harbour of <HI>Vigo</HI> in <HI>Gallicia</HI>) had a quantity of Peruvian Bark, which was part of the plun|der brought home at that time. It was bought, about four years ago, by Mr. PEARSON, an Apothecary in <HI>Spital Square,</HI> who a&s;|&s;ured me that it was the Red Bark: its Decoction was much &s;tronger than that of the Common Bark, and he found it very efficacious in the cure of Fevers and other Di&s;ea&s;es. This &s;eems a collateral proof of the Red Bark being early in u&s;e.</P></NOTE> <HI>M. LA CONDAMINE</HI> expre&s;&s;ed his
<PB N="vi" REF="6">&s;urpri&s;e, when he was told by Mr. <HI>THOMAS BLACHYN|DEN,</HI> Director of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> South Sea Compa|ny, at <HI>Panama,</HI> that the writers on <HI>Pharmacy</HI> and <HI>Materia Medica</HI> in <HI>England</HI> had preferred the Small and Quill Bark, while the inhabitants of <HI>New Spain,</HI> held the larger Bark in higher e&s;timation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They commonly reckon three &s;pecies of the <HI>Quinquina,</HI> tho &s;ome make four; the white, the yellow, and the red: I was told at <HI>Loxa,</HI> that the&s;e three kinds differ in their virtue only; the white having &s;carce any virtue, and the red excelling the yellow.
<P>The trees from whence the fir&s;t Bark was taken, which were very large, are all dead, having been entirely &s;tripped, which infallibly ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ls them when they come to be old. Expe|rience has &s;hewn that &s;tripping kills &s;ome of the young ones al&s;o, but the greate&s;t part e&s;cape. For this operation they u&s;e a common knife, which they hold in both hands; the barker &s;ticks it into the Bark as high as he can reach, and &s;o draws it downwards as low as he can. It does not appear that the trees which grow where the old ones &s;tood, have le&s;s virtue than they, the &s;ituation and &s;oil being the &s;ame; the difference, if there be any, may ari&s;e, perhaps, from the different ages of the trees. Few but young ones are now to be met with: I do not remember to have &s;een any much thicker than my arm, or a|bove 12 or 15 feet high; tho&s;e which are cut young, &s;hoot forth new branches from the &s;tumps.</P>
<P>I was informed at <HI>Loxa,</HI> that heretofore, they preferred the coar&s;e&s;t Bark, and laid it by as a rarity, but now the fine&s;t is mo&s;t e&s;teemed: the merchants may po&s;&s;ibly find their account in it, as it takes up le&s;s room in packing. But a director of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> South Sea Company at <HI>Panama.</HI> through which all the <HI>Quinquina</HI> that comes to <HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s, a&s;&s;ured me, that the preference given at pre&s;ent to the fine Bark, is in con&s;equence of &s;everal chymical analy&s;es and experiments which have been made on both &s;orts in <HI>England.</HI> It &s;eems probable, that the difficulty of thoroughly drying the large coar&s;e bark, and the humidity it is naturally apt to contract and retain, has hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to bring it into di&s;repute. Vulgar prejudice will have it, that to lo&s;e nothing of its virtue, the tree &s;hould be barked in the moon's decrea&s;e, and on the ea&s;t &s;ide. The&s;e circum&s;tances, as al&s;o its being gathered on the mountain of <HI>Cajanuma,</HI> were cer|tified by a notary in 1735. where the marquis de <HI>Ca&s;telfuerte</HI> procured a quantity of <HI>Quinquina</HI> from <HI>Loxa,</HI> to carry to <HI>Spain</HI> on his return. Memoir de l'Acad. d. Sc. 1738.</P></NOTE> I can only explain &s;uch a preference from this circum&s;tance,
<PB N="vii" REF="7">that the larger pieces of Bark which were imported into this country along with the &s;maller Bark, were either of a <HI>fibrous, &s;pongy,</HI> or <HI>ligneous</HI> texture; or, probably damaged by moi&s;ture, and taken from decayed trees.</P>
<P>Druggi&s;ts have &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;ted this as an argu|ment again&s;t the u&s;e of the pre&s;ent Bark, and many pro|bably endeavour to oppo&s;e its introduction, until the quan|tity in the markets be greater, and more equally divided
<PB N="viii" REF="8">among them&punc; or until they have been able to di&s;po&s;e of the large quantity of common Bark they have in their warehou&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>flavour</HI> of the <HI>Red Bark</HI> is more difficultly evolved&punc; and is therefore at fir&s;t not &s;o obv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ous from the clo&s;ene&s;s of its texture, and from the re&s;inous coat being &s;o well defended and inclo&s;ed between other two layers. It is evidently heavier thin any other kind of Bark, and &s;eems to have been prepared and dried with g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eater attenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n, its original appearance and form being better pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>I think it probable from a more attentive view of the &s;ubject that it may be the Bark of the trunk of the tree, and I am the more confirmed in this opinion by the ideas of my friends <HI>Dr. WITHERING</HI> and <HI>Dr. FO|THERGILL,</HI> conveyed in their letters to me; in which, they ob&s;erve that the e&s;&s;ential and active parts of the Oak Bark are more intire, and in larger quantity in the trunk and larger branches, than in the twigs or &s;maller branches, which are comparatively of an im|perfect growth, perhaps the Small and Quilled Bark may be procured from younger trees not yet arrived at
<PB N="ix" REF="9">their full maturity and therefore yielding a Bark of a weaker quality.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. ARROT, a Scotch Surgeon who had gathered the Bark in the place where it grows, &s;ays that the &s;mall curled Bark &s;o much e&s;teemed in England is the Bark of younger Trees, which frequently recover the Barking, while the old|er Trees never do. This affords a &s;trong proof that the early Bark introduced into Europe was of the larger kind and from the older Trees, while the difficulty of procuring it, has been the means of introducing a &s;maller and younger Bark. Mr. ARROT, and all other Travellers agree, in preferring the Red Bark to any other.
<P>Encyclopaedia. Cortex. Vol. I.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>If the execution of this work was equal to its impor|tance, it would challenge the attention of the public, in a degree far above mo&s;t medical &s;ubjects. This will be unque&s;tionably admitted by tho&s;e who have been eye witn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es to the fatality and malignancy of <HI>intermit|tent</HI> and <HI>remittent Fevers</HI> in every part of the globe, but more e&s;pecially in warm climates; this fatality is by no means owing to the ignorance or un&s;kifulne&s;s of the practitioners in tho&s;e countries, but to the inefficacy of the Common Bark in general u&s;e.</P>
<P>The numbers, who fall a &s;acrifice to the <HI>Epidemic</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;oning Fevers</HI> of <HI>warm Climates,</HI> are admit|ted
<PB N="x" REF="10">infinitely to exceed tho&s;e who are de&s;troyed by the Ene|my. In almo&s;t all the dangerous Fevers which occur in our <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t India Settlements,</HI> the Bark is a principal <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>I think it therefore an object of the greate&s;t national importance, that our <HI>Fleets</HI> and <HI>Armies</HI> &s;hould be li|berally &s;upplied with this Bark which will &s;eldom or ever di&s;appoint them. I have been told by a Druggi&s;t, that its great <HI>activity</HI> rendered it a dangerous remedy, my an&s;wer was that wine mixed with water was much &s;afer in the hands of an un&s;kilful practitioner, than wine alone, but that did not prove that wine was not a better cordial than water. The &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">me rea&s;oning may be ap|plied to prove, that weak and decayed remedies, by being much milder in their operations, are therefore preferable to &s;uch as are more perfect of their kind. I believe the general and be&s;t founded complaint is again&s;t the want of power and efficacy of Bark, and not that it is too powerful and active. In proof of this I refer my Readers to the Letters annexed, which evidently demon|&s;trate that &s;uch was the &s;tubborne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of the
<PB N="xi" REF="11"><HI>Intermittent Fevers</HI> of this year, even in this country, that they re&s;i&s;ted common Bark, and only gave way to the <HI>Red Bark.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I formed very early a favourable opinion of this Bark, yet it fell far &s;hort of that which I am now ju&s;tified in maintaining from the collected evidence of &s;o many Gentlemen in di&s;tant and remote parts of the country. Many letters which I have re|ceived are wrote with &s;uch zeal in favour of its &s;upe|rior efficacy, that they could only be dictated by the &s;trong|e&s;t conviction ari&s;ing from exten&s;ive and diligent ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I have per&s;uaded many of my Medical friends to u&s;e the <HI>Red Bark</HI> in our foreign &s;ettlements, and, &s;hall take plea&s;ure in communicating to the public the re&s;ult of their ob&s;ervations &s;o &s;oon as I am favoured with them. A more powerful Bark is particularly de&s;ireable in tho&s;e countries, where the violence and danger of the paroxy&s;m is &s;o great. In the following ob&s;ervations, I have confined my&s;elf very much to the u&s;e of the Red
<PB N="xii" REF="12">Bark in febrile Di&s;ea&s;es, but I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many facts in proof of its &s;uperior powers in other di&s;ea&s;es in which the common Peruvian Bark has been found u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The public may be always a&s;&s;ured of the fidelity of my ob&s;ervations, and that my only motive is that of re&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ring to general u&s;e a <HI>remedy</HI> which was found &s;o efficacious by <HI>MORTON</HI> and <HI>SYDENHAM,</HI> and which in the hands &s;kilful Phy&s;icians may be con&s;idered as an antidote to the fatal influence of <HI>Mar&s;hy Grounds</HI> and <HI>Unhealthy Climates.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1779, a Spani&s;h Ship from <HI>Lima,</HI> bound to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> was taken by the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ar Frigate</HI> and carried into <HI>Li&s;bon;</HI> her cargo con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of this Bark, a part of which was afterwards brought into this country, and purcha&s;ed by &s;everal Druggi&s;ts in <HI>London.</HI> It is of &s;o large a kind, and has &s;o coar&s;e an appearance, that it was with much dif|ficulty they could prevail on Medical Practitioners to pre&s;cribe it. Its reputation was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by trials made in the public Ho&s;pitals, and its &s;uperior efficacy has been well a&s;certained by the mo&s;t attentive ob&s;ervation.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="14">
<P>In the following pages are contained &s;ome very in|tere&s;ting matters of fact, which will throw much light on the choice of this drug, and on the general applica|tion of Bark in the cure of Agues and other Fevers. Altho' the general title, by which it was &s;old, was that of <HI>Quinquina,</HI> yet it was &s;uppo&s;ed by our Druggi&s;ts to be a new medicine. They called it the red Bark; it appears however, both from an attention to its &s;en&s;i|ble qualities and the information procured from <HI>Spain,</HI> that it is the true <HI>Peruvian Bark,</HI> of a quality probably &s;uperior to any ever known in this country. This fact is farther proved by its being found &s;ometimes in &s;mall detached pieces among&s;t other Bark, it &s;eems however hitherto to have e&s;caped our particular notice.</P>
<P>The Author highly &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of e&s;tab|li&s;hing facts either on the effects of remedies, or on any branch of medicine which regards the Animal Oeco|nomy, has &s;olicited the opinion of many ingenious and attentive practitioners, who from their &s;ituation have had frequent opportunities of trying the Red Bark.
<PB N="iii" REF="15">This caution appeared the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e he is well per&s;uaded that the love of novelty, and too great a credulity in admitting fal&s;e facts, on very doubtful au|thorities, have corrupted medicine more than any other Science, and proved more injurious than the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and fanciful theories, the errors of which are ea&s;ily detected.</P>

<HEAD>Of its Natural Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Bark of a Tree which grows in the neighbourhood of <HI>Loxa</HI> chiefly on the mountain of <HI>Cajanuma.</HI> It is propagated &s;pontaneou&s;ly. The tree is &s;eldom more than <HI>fifteen</HI> feet high. Its trunk and branches of a proportional thickne&s;s. The Bark is carefully cut off in the dry &s;ea&s;on, and gently dried by the heat of the Sun, before it is packed for foreign u&s;e. It has been di&s;tingui&s;hed into the white, yellow and red, the la&s;t is generally preferred, but they are only to be con&s;idered as varieties of the &s;ame tree, depending on &s;oil, expo|&s;ure and other accidental circum&s;tances. Perhaps the age of the tree and the &s;ize of it branches, from whence the Bark is taken, as well as the care and attention be&s;towed in the preparing it, may in|fluence its powers and efficacy. I am per&s;ua|uaded
<PB N="2" REF="17">that the Bark of which we are now treat|ing is the <HI>"Cinchona officinalis Linn. Sp. pl.</HI> 244 <HI>mat. Med.</HI> 71 <HI>Quinquina De la Condamine Memoir del' Acad. d. Sc.</HI> 1738 <HI>p.</HI> 226 <HI>t.</HI> 5 <HI>fig. A. E. &amp; t.</HI> 6 <HI>f. F.</HI> S.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Old Spain</HI> always preferred the larger Bark, and from the account of travel|lers, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that more attention is paid in collecting and drying the Bark which is con&s;umed in <HI>Spain,</HI> than what is brought to a fo|reign market. I hope that the information which I &s;hall give on this &s;ubject will &s;timulate Druggi&s;ts to procure the Red Peruvian Bark, and remove the prejudices which have prevailed again&s;t &s;o large a Bark in favour of the &s;mall, thin, and quilled Bark, hitherto the &s;ubject of their choice.</P>
<P>This Red Bark is very di&s;tingui&s;hable from tho&s;e large coar&s;e woody and fibrous ma&s;&s;es, oc|ca&s;ionally mixed with the common Peruvian Bark.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>Of its Sen&s;ible Qualities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Red Bark is in much larger and thicker pieces than the common Peruvian Bark. It evi|dently con&s;i&s;ts of three di&s;tinct layers. The exter|nal thin, rugged, and frequently covered with a mo&s;&s;y &s;ub&s;tance, and of a reddi&s;h brown colour. The middle, thicker, more compact, and of a dark|er colour. In this appears chiefly to re&s;ide its re|&s;inous part, being extremely brittle, and evidently containing a larger quantity of inflammable mat|ter than any other kind of Bark.</P>
<P>The innermo&s;t has a more woody and fibrous appearance, of a brighter red than the former.</P>
<P>The intire piece breaks in that brittle manner de&s;cribed by writers on the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> as a proof of the &s;uperiour excellence of the Bark.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="19">
<P>In reducing it to powder, the middle layer, which &s;eems to contain the greate&s;t proportion of Re&s;in, will not give way to the pe&s;tle &s;o ea&s;ily as the other layers; this &s;hould be particularly at|tended to when it is u&s;ed in fine powder. Its flavour is chiefly di&s;coverable either in powder or &s;olution, is evidently more aromatic, and has a greater degree of bitterne&s;s than the common Bark.</P>

<P>To an ounce of red Bark, reduced to a fine pow|der, were added <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> ounces of di&s;tilled water; and, after remaining together <HI>twenty-four</HI> hours in a florence fla&s;k, the liquid was carefully filtered.

<P>The colour of the two infu&s;ions was very differ|ent, that made with the Red Bark being much deeper.

In the opinion of many Gentlemen who ta&s;ted the infu&s;ions, the cold infu&s;ion of the red Bark was more &s;en&s;ibly impregnated than even the &s;tronge&s;t decoction of the common Bark.</P>

<HEAD>Of the general Operation of Bark on the Human Body.</HEAD>
<P>The following remarks are intended to apply to the Peruvian Bark, generally in u&s;e; but I am cer|tain that the effects enumerated are found to be produced in a much higher degree by the red Bark.</P>
<P>The cold infu&s;ion of Bark &s;eems evidently to promote both appetite and dige&s;tion, it increa&s;es the tone and action of the &s;tomach, by which the Ga&s;|tric
<PB N="15" REF="30">liquor, the great <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> of our &s;olid ali|ment, is more perfectly prepared.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t ca&s;es, the Bark rather promotes co&s;tive|ne&s;s, the common effect of &s;trong and vigorous in|te&s;tines. In very large do&s;es however it proves purgative, but this effect cea&s;es after a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>It renders the pul&s;e &s;tronger and fuller in health, and in mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es unaccompained with fever.</P>
<P>In low and malignant fevers, and more e&s;pecially under remi&s;&s;ion, it renders the pul&s;e &s;tronger and even flower.</P>
<P>In particular circum&s;tances of fever marked with debility and a tendency to remi&s;&s;ion, tho' of a very irregular type, it demini&s;hes febrile heat.</P>
<P>It encrea&s;es the animal heat and aggravates every Symptom, in fevers accompanied either with much local inflammation, or a general inflammatory di|athe&s;is, which is &s;trongly indicated by the pul&s;e the manner of the original attack, the want of due
<PB N="16" REF="31">freedom in the &s;ecretions, and the painful and op|pre&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e of every function.</P>
<P>It checks profu&s;e and colliquative di&s;charges, e&s;pecially tho&s;e by the &s;kin, while it does not &s;eem to dimini&s;h in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, or other na|tural evacuations.</P>
<P>It checks every tendency to putrefaction or gan|grene, occurring under circum&s;tances of debility, but if may promote both, if injudiciou&s;ly employ|ed, while the action of the &s;y&s;tem is too violent, or the inflammatory diathe&s;is is too prevalent. It &s;eems more re&s;onable to refer its action, as an an|ti&s;eptic, to its tonic power on the moving &s;y&s;tem, than to any primary action on the animal fluids.</P>
<P>Perhaps this doctrine will apply in explaining the hi&s;tory of remedies u&s;ed in the Scurvy, a di&s;|ea&s;e invited and avoured by every means which can induce debility, and evidently preceded by &s;ymp|toms of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ni&s;hed <HI>vis vitoe</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily lead

<P>It promotes under many circum&s;tances a favour|able &s;uppuration and improves the nature of &s;an|ious and ichorous di&s;charges.</P>
<P>Its action here can only be explained from its general tonic power, for either general or local de|bility retards &s;uppuration and favours the ob&s;tinacy of ill conditioned ulcers.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame principle its power of promoting the &s;uppuration, and generation of true <HI>pus</HI> in the &s;mall pox may be explained.</P>
<P>The period of debility is that only in which the Bark &s;hould be employed.</P>
<P>I have &s;een patients under the mo&s;t confluent Small Pox require Bark in the progre&s;s of &s;uppur|ation,

<P>In delicate and irritable habits, which &s;eem more e&s;pecially to favour &s;crophulous affections, and which produce inflammation of a peculiar nature, that gives way &s;ooner to tonics than evacuants, the Bark has been found the be&s;t remedy: This may probably admit of the explanation already given on the &s;ubject of Scurvy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of its u&s;e in the Cure of In|termittent Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>What I have to offer on this &s;ubject is the re|&s;ult of careful and diligent ob&s;ervation, totally un|connected
<PB N="19" REF="34">with prejudice of any kind, ill favour of any particular theory, or a blind attachment to &s;y&s;|tem.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the cautious and timid practiti|oner has very generally forbid the u&s;e of Bark un|til evacuations &s;hould have been made; I am very well per&s;uaded from ob&s;ervation that in inter|mittent fevers, &s;uch as rage and are endemic, par|ticurlarly in low and mar&s;hy &s;ituations, and &s;uch as frequently occur on the banks of the Thames, and the lower parts of this metropolis the Bark cannot be given too early, the u&s;e of either emetics or purgatives, as preparatory, is not only unnece&s;|&s;ary, but in &s;ome ca&s;es productive of more debility, and therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>The doctrine of concoction however ju&s;t it may be in continued fevers, and in &s;ome ca&s;es of inflam|mation, does not apply in intermittents produced by the <HI>Mia&s;mata</HI> of low and &s;wampy grounds, and which afford the principal &s;ource of agues in the environs of this City.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="35">
<P>In this opinion I am confirmed by the te&s;timony of Dr. CLEGHORN and others; who frequently found it nece&s;&s;ary to give it on the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e in order effectually to obviate, or weaken the return of a &s;econd paroxy&s;m, which in many ca&s;es would inevitably have proved fatal, and Dr. LIND has very properly ob&s;erved that &s;uch &s;ymptoms from vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions, which have been attributed to Bark, are rather the effect of the paroxy&s;m being allowed to return, from the omi&s;&s;ion of that medicine.</P>
<P>There are many &s;ymptoms which would forbid the u&s;e of Bark, did they occur di&s;tinct and inde|pendent of intermittent fever, &s;uch as cough, diffi|culty of breathing and pain in the &s;ide: they are frequently brought on by the paroxy&s;m of the in|termittent, and only give way to the u&s;e of the Bark by which that paroxy&s;m may be prevented. Such &s;ymptoms do not admit of a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate treatment, but are always aggravated by the u&s;e of Evacuants, more e&s;pecially bleeding, the mo&s;t pro|bable
<PB N="21" REF="36">means of relieving in common depuratory fevers.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes found a complication of In|termittent and Hectic fever in the &s;ame per&s;on, and could di&s;tingui&s;h between the paroxy&s;ms of each: the Bark while it cured the intermittent, has even moderated the Hectic; tho' Hectic fever of it&s;elf, e&s;pecially as a &s;ymptom of <HI>Phthi&s;is Pulmon|alis</HI> does not appear to give way at any time un|der the u&s;e of the Bark; I think it probable, there|fore, that altho' in the treatment of intermittents complicated with other di&s;ea&s;es, our chief attention &s;hould be fir&s;t directed to the cure of the intermit|tent, yet it may be nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue an indicati|on that may have in view the other di&s;orders, not incompatible with the treatment of the intermittent. In drop&s;ies, which accompany intermittents, I have found more benefit from the u&s;e of Bark, joined to the neutral &s;alts, and other mild diuretics, than from active purgatives, which always tend to pro|tract the intermittent. Every returning paroyx&s;in
<PB N="22" REF="37">of an ague confirms more and more the cau&s;e of that di&s;ea&s;e which it has produced.</P>
<P>It is not intended to in&s;inuate that no ca&s;es do occur, in which it may not be prudent to admini&s;ter a vomit, e&s;pecially to per&s;ons &s;ubject to bilious accu|mulations in the &s;tomach: but this is more with a view of removing an ob&s;tacle to the operation of Bark, than as nece&s;&s;ary to render it &s;afe, and I have frequently &s;een <HI>nau&s;ea</HI> and vomiting &s;o much a &s;ymptom of the paroxy&s;m, that they gave way only to the free u&s;e of Bark it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A practice more ab&s;urd than that of preceding evacuations has been adopted and recommended. <HI>viz.</HI> that of evacuating by purgatives after the cure had been compleated by the Bark, this &s;eldom fails of bringing back the intermittent, as one cau&s;e of inducing debility, the mo&s;t favourable &s;tate of the body for the attack of intermittent fevers.</P>
<P>In per&s;ons who are rendered co&s;tive by the u&s;e of the Bark, I would recommend the common
<PB N="23" REF="38">practice of giving a few grains of Rhubarb, or <HI>Pilul. Rufi.</HI> If on the other hand it &s;hould prove pur|gative, a few drops of the <HI>Thebaic Tincture</HI> is the u&s;ual and be&s;t means of checking that operation.</P>
<P>Intermittent fevers are frequently &s;o very ano|malous in their appearances and a&s;&s;ume &s;o much the character of other di&s;ea&s;es that an un&s;kilful, or an inattentive practitioner may be deceived; they however, under any form or any type, generally give way to the Bark; &s;ometimes aided and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by other means.</P>
<P>Both the Vernal and Autumnal intermittents of Dr. SYDENHAM yield to it, the latter however &s;ometimes with more ob&s;tinacy than the former.</P>
<P>In &s;everal ca&s;es I have experienced the &s;uperior efficacy of the red Bark in removing <HI>Tertians</HI> and <HI>Quartans</HI> which had re&s;i&s;ted the common Bark, this however is not to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider the diver&s;ity in the power even of differ|ent kinds of the common Bark in general u&s;e.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="39">
<P>I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in digre&s;&s;ing &s;o far, as to mention the u&s;eful effects I have frequently ex|perienced from the exhibition of Opium in inter|mittent fevers. We are chiefly indebted for this practice to Dr. LIND. It moderates &s;o effectually the force of the paroxy&s;m by &s;hortening the dura|tion of the cold fit, as well as by dimini&s;hing the violence of the hot fit, that I had often flattered my&s;elf it was capable of curing intermittents. In this however I was di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>From the experience of it in many hundred ca&s;es, I conclude with Dr. LIND. <Q>"That an Opiate given &s;oon after the commencement of the hot fit, by abating the violence and le&s;&s;ening the duration of the fever, pre&s;erves the con&s;titution &s;o entirely uninjured, that &s;ince I u&s;ed Opium in agues, neither a drop&s;y nor jaundice has at|tacked any of my patients in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es."</Q> The manner in which I employ it, is either by giving a grain of the <HI>Thebaic</HI> extract upon the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of the cold fit, or <HI>twenty</HI> drops of the <HI>Theba|ic</HI> tincture upon the acce&s;&s;ion of the hot fit, the ac|tion
<PB N="25" REF="40">of the former being later from its flower &s;o|lubility.</P>
<P>The red Bark is &s;o much warmer than the other, that it would &s;eem to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es de|rived from the union of cordials, aromatics, &s;erpen|taria and the like &s;o much recommended in the ob&s;tinate <HI>Quartan</HI> intermittents of elderly people.</P>
<P>Some difference in opinion has prevailed regard|ing the manner of giving the Bark. Mo&s;t practi|tioners concur in thinking that it cures intermit|tents more readily when taken in &s;ub&s;tance than in any other form. In this &s;tate, it is both a bulky and nau&s;eous do&s;e in the quantity nece&s;&s;ary to cure an intermittent, at any rate, it ought rather to be diffu&s;ed in &s;ome liquid, than given in the form of an electuary or pills, which are &s;ometimes dif|ficultly &s;oluble.</P>
<P>I have found milk cover the ta&s;te of Bark and make it more acceptable to children than any o|ther vehicle. The extract of liquorice di&s;&s;olved
<PB N="26" REF="41">in water, may be likewi&s;e employed to cover the ta&s;te of Bark. Its ta&s;te is al&s;o corrected by wine, e&s;pecially by Old Hock.</P>
<P>It would appear from the general preference given to Bark in &s;ub&s;tance, that its decoction, infu|&s;ion or tincture are found too weak in any quan|tity for the purpo&s;e of curing intermittents, other|wi&s;e as they are much lighter to the &s;tomach and act more quickly, they &s;hould be preferred.</P>
<P>I hope to make it appear that in this re&s;pect the red Bark has evidently the advantage of any other kind now in u&s;e, &s;ince either its infu&s;ion or decoc|tion will cure intermittents, and that its powder in a much &s;maller do&s;e than that of common Bark will produce &s;imilar effects.</P>
<P>The be&s;t time for giving the Bark is in the inter|mi&s;&s;ion between the paroxy&s;ms and when the &s;to|mach is empty. In <HI>Quartan</HI> fevers, where there are <HI>two</HI> days of <HI>Apyrexia,</HI> we &s;hould be particular|ly de&s;irous of getting down a large quantity on the
<PB N="27" REF="42">day immediately preceding the approaching pa|roxy&s;m, and in other intermittents as near the peri|od of the returning paroxy&s;m as the &s;tomach will bear it.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to limit the do&s;e. One drachm may be given every hour, if the &s;tomach will re|tain it, and will remove the di&s;ea&s;e more quickly than a &s;maller quantity given at longer periods.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I have likewi&s;e frequently adopted the practice recommended by Dr. HOME, of giving the Bark &s;o &s;oon as the &s;weating fit of the fever has &s;ufficiently carried off the hot fit; this is particularly proper when the interval is &s;hort between the paroxy&s;ms.</NOTE></P>
<P>The following facts will be&s;t deter|mine how far I am ju&s;tified in favouring the opinion of the &s;uperior excellence of the red Bark.</P>
<P>EDWARD VIRGOE, aged 21, had laboured un|der an intermittent fever <HI>five</HI> months. It was fir&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="43">a <HI>tertian</HI> and afterwards became a regular <HI>Quotidian,</HI> accompanied with cough, dy&s;pnoea and hoar&s;ene&s;s particularly in the paroxy&s;m. The common Per|uvian Bark, given in the do&s;e of one drachm every hour prevented the return of the paroxy&s;m for a few days; the patient however &s;oon relap&s;ed not with|&s;tanding the Bark was continued, he was at la&s;t cured by taking one drachm of the red Bark eve|ry &s;econd hour for the &s;pace of <HI>ten</HI> days.</P>
<P>It appears from the above ca&s;e of <HI>Edward Vir|goe,</HI> and &s;everal others which have occurred to me, that intermittent fevers which had re&s;i&s;ted common Bark and other remedies, have yielded to the red Bark, even under very complicated and unfavour|able appearances.</P>
<P>In this opinion I am likewi&s;e ju&s;tified by the ex|perience and te&s;timony of many eminent practiti|oners, and &s;o decided are they in its favour that the demand for it every day increa&s;es, e&s;pecially in &s;ome of the neighbouring counties where intermit|tents are not only more frequent, but more ob&s;tinate.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="44">
<P>I began now to &s;u&s;pect that its powers were even &s;ufficient in cold infu&s;ion in mo&s;t ca&s;es to cure in|termittent fevers, and in all other ca&s;es to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e which might be expected from com|mon Peruvian Bark, in any form in which it had hitherto been employed.</P>
<P>The following facts are &s;ufficient to au|thori&s;e this opinion.</P>
<P>JAMES YOUNGMAN, aged 16, had laboured under a <HI>tertian</HI> intermittent many months; it was accompanied with a &s;evere cough, and his &s;trength was con&s;iderably impaired.

<P>THOMAS PUGH, aged 22, from <HI>Woolwich</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> had an intermittent fever of <HI>five</HI> weeks &s;tand|ing of the <HI>Tertian</HI> type, accompanied with a con|&s;iderable degree of cough, occurring e&s;pecially in the cold fit, he took the cold infu&s;ion, as recom|mended
<PB N="30" REF="45">in the former ca&s;e, &s;ince which time he had only one flight return of the paroxy&s;m, his cough is likewi&s;e totally removed.</P>
<P>JOHN WELDING, aged 25, had an intermittent fever at <HI>Sheerne&s;s</HI> for near a year, he took, large quantities of common Peruvian Bark without effect. It was of the <HI>Quotidian</HI> type. After taking a cold in|fu&s;ion of the red Bark in the quantity of a quart in <HI>twenty-four</HI> hours for <HI>three</HI> days, the paroxy&s;m di&s;appeared and has never &s;ince returned. It pro|ved at fir&s;t purgative but &s;oon lo&s;t that effect. His &s;trength and appetite were greatly improved, under the u&s;e of the infu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The cold infu&s;ion employed in the above ca&s;es was prepared by pouring a quart of cold water on <HI>two</HI> ounces of the red Bark in fine powder, frequently, agitating them for the &s;pace of <HI>twenty|four</HI> hours.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">Tho' the ca&s;es above mentioned evidently prove that the cold infu&s;ion will cure Agues, yet they are not intended to divert the attention from other more ef|fectual means of giving this Medecine.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Of its u&s;e in the cure of other Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>Remittent fevers are frequently equally &s;teady in their periods of remi&s;&s;ion and acce&s;&s;ion with tho&s;e of the intermittent kind, but the <HI>Apyrexia</HI> be|ing le&s;s perfect and complete has given ri&s;e to many doubts regarding the &s;afety of giving Bark.

<P>The fevers of this country &s;eldom have regular remi&s;&s;ions, until they have been properly treated by evacuations; the inflammatory by bleeding, and the bilious by vomiting and purging.</P>
<P>When fevers are brought into a &s;tate of obvious remi&s;&s;ion, that is, when the pul&s;e becomes from 10 to 20 &s;lower at &s;ome particular time in the 24 hours; when the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, anxiety, and tendency to delirium abate; when the mouth and fauces are moi&s;t; when the organs of &s;ecretion, and e&s;pecially
<PB N="33" REF="48">the &s;kin are more open and pervious, &s;uch &s;ymptoms of remi&s;&s;ion admit the u&s;e of Bark with the &s;ame freedom as in intermitting fevers.</P>
<P>The acute rheumati&s;m, notwith&s;tanding its inflam|matory attack, and the appearance of the blood, and although the joints often continue inflamed &s;e|veral weeks, very early a&s;&s;umes the form of a re|mitting fever.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, a per&s;everance in the <HI>Antiphlogi&s;tic</HI> plan is generally found to be ineffec|tual. I have, in &s;everal ca&s;es of this kind, employed a cold infu&s;ion of the red Bark, and the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to give way only to this treatment.</P>
<P>The acute rheumati&s;m in its remi&s;&s;ions a&s;&s;umes the form of a double <HI>Tertian,</HI> and the patient is fre|quently greatly exhau&s;ted by the profu&s;e &s;weatings which terminate the paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>It is in &s;uch ca&s;es that I would particularly re|commend the u&s;e of Bark. I have found this prac|tice
<PB N="34" REF="49">more &s;ucce&s;sful, and it mu&s;t be allowed to be more rational than the u&s;e of <HI>Volatiles</HI> and <HI>Guaiac.</HI></P>
<P>It does not appear to me in any degree repug|nant to ju&s;t theory founded on ob&s;ervations made in &s;imilar ca&s;es, that at a time when the lancet may be u&s;ed moderately or topical bleeding with more freedom, the Bark may be given &s;o as to obviate the debility of a long and tedious di&s;ea&s;e, and by keeping up the &s;trength of the &s;y&s;tem, prevent that torpor and di&s;po&s;ition to chronic rheumati&s;m &s;o frequently the effect of the acute.</P>
<P>In that low fever, which HUXHAM has &s;o well de&s;cribed under the title of nervous, I have pre|&s;cribed the cold infu&s;ion of the red Bark with ad|vantage, where the &s;kin hath been &s;oft, and the pul&s;e under one hundred and ten.</P>
<P>In &s;uch fevers, it chiefly acts as a cordial in &s;upporting the <HI>Vis Vitae,</HI> and for which rea&s;on I think it may be given with advantage in the de|cline of all fevers, even where the &s;ymptoms on the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e were evidently inflammatory.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="50">
<P>Almo&s;t every Fever remits in its decline.</P>
<P>Fevers originally putrid and malignant, as ari&s;ing from <HI>Mia&s;mata</HI> and putrid vapour, very &s;eldom oc|cur in this City, they are mo&s;t generally to be found in Fleets and in Camps, and in &s;ituations where air &s;tagnates or where animal bodies are confined in a clo&s;e place.</P>
<P>In &s;uch fevers, the cure is effected by vomiting and warm cordials, of the la&s;t is the red Bark in an eminent degree.</P>
<P>It may be infu&s;ed in wine, which will render its operation more anti&s;eptic.</P>
<P>It intimately unites with the &s;everal acids, from which a very favourable operation in &s;uch ca&s;es may be expected.</P>
<P>In the putrid fever, attended with a gangrenous &s;ore throat, I have in many in&s;tances experience|ed the efficacy of Bark, but care &s;hould be taken
<PB N="36" REF="51">not to confound this di&s;ea&s;e with the <HI>Angina Muco&s;a</HI> of Dr. HUXHAM, or the <HI>Angina Ery&s;ipelato&s;a</HI> of Dr. GRANT, di&s;ea&s;es, tho' contagious and accom|panied with <HI>Eruptions</HI> on the &s;kin, evidently of the mo&s;t inflammatory nature and requiring the u&s;e of <HI>Evacuations.</HI></P>
<P>In Petechial Fevers with &s;ymptoms of great pro|&s;tration of &s;trength, I have frequently &s;een the pul&s;e not much quickened and the animal heat very little increa&s;ed. In &s;uch ca&s;es I would recom|mend the u&s;e of the red Bark infu&s;ed in Old Hock.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a Jail Fever with no other di&s;tin|gui&s;hing &s;ymptoms than Petechiae and Debility; the Tongue clean, the pul&s;e moderate tho' &s;mall, and the &s;ecretions apparently not di&s;turbed. In that ca&s;e, bli&s;ters on the Extremities, Bark and Wine are the be&s;t remedies.</P>
<P>In general we find that Fevers marked with &s;ymptoms of debility are chiefly found to remit,
<PB N="37" REF="52">and therefore they admit of the u&s;e of Bark; by in|crea&s;ing the Tone and Vigor of the &s;y&s;tem, it op|po&s;es a returning Paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>Fevers of more violent action, &s;uch as we de|nominate inflammatory, do not remit at lea&s;t &s;o obviou&s;ly, until that action is moderated by Eva|cuations, &s;o that they chiefly remit only in their decline.</P>
<P>The primary attack of mo&s;t &s;evers in this coun|try, is attended with violent action, which is be&s;t moderated &s;ometimes by the prudent u&s;e of the lancet, but mo&s;t frequently by the <HI>Tart. Emetis</HI> with the infu&s;ion of <HI>Sena</HI> and &s;ome of the neutral &s;alts. All &s;evers beginning with a violent <HI>Rigor,</HI> and fol|lowed with great heat, require early evacuations, while &s;uch as creep on &s;lowly and imperceptibly in the beginning, with giddine&s;s in the head, rather than acute pain, much anxiety and watchfulne&s;s, tremor and debility, give way to Opiates, Bark, Serpentaria and Wine. Bli&s;ters applied to the arms are ex|tremely u&s;eful in keeping up the pul&s;e, e&s;pecially if
<PB N="38" REF="53">the &s;kin be &s;oft, the tongue and fauces &s;ufficiently moi&s;t; much more may be learned by attending to this la&s;t appearance than is generally known.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the dryne&s;s of the tongue and mouth, as a &s;ymp|tom of the fever, and as ari&s;ing from the circum|&s;tance of a patient &s;leeping with his mouth open.</P>
<P>I hope the ob&s;ervations here offered to the pub|lic on the &s;ubject of this invaluable remedy, will re|move all prejudices again&s;t a Peruvian Bark of a large and coar&s;er appearance, than is generally employed.</P>
<P>It is at pre&s;ent in very great demand, the difficulty of procuring it will not, I hope, in&s;tigate Druggi&s;ts and Dealers in the article, to &s;ub&s;titute at any time a &s;purious kind in its room.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Mr. EDWARD JACOB, jun^r^. an eminent Surgeon, at <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had &s;uch repeated opportunities of trying the Red Bark, that I hope to be able to give you every &s;atisfaction, you can wi&s;h, of its &s;uperior efficacy over the Bark in common u&s;e.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation being in a country not far di&s;tant from the mar&s;hes, renders the inhabitants more ex|po&s;ed to intermittent complaints than tho&s;e of cities and more inland counties; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, before the u&s;e of the Red Bark was known, the Ague, from its particular &s;tubborne&s;s, (as we then thought, or what we have &s;ince ob&s;erved from the want of efficacy in the other Bark,) might be truly called the <HI>opprobrium Medicorum;</HI> but, now I think, that &s;tain is entirely removed, for I have not met with one &s;ingle ca&s;e, where (when I could per&s;uade the patient to adhere &s;teadily to my advice) I have ever found the Red Bark to fail.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="55">
<P>The Peruvian Bark, with which I was formerly provided, was of the be&s;t kind, and always had in the quill; yet, it was even much inferior in its ef|fects to what ought rea&s;onably to be expected from it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t knowledge that ever we had of the Red Bark was in <HI>March,</HI> 1781, when a few pounds was &s;ent us to try its effects; our Druggi&s;t informed us that it was then in u&s;e at St. <HI>Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital,</HI> and was there found effectual. It remained in our hou&s;e till <HI>May</HI> following, when I was attacked with an Ague; I did not at fir&s;t think of trying the <HI>new</HI> Bark, for I gue&s;&s;ed, by taking of the <HI>old</HI> in great quantity, which would not be di&s;agreeable to me, that my Ague would &s;oon leave me; but, to my great di&s;appointment, fit &s;ucceeded fit, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t good effect of the remedy applied. I was then determined to try the <HI>new</HI> Bark; but, finding my Ague &s;tubborn I emptied the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> by an Emetic and Carthartic, and immediately, on the fe|ver going off, I took one drachm of the Red Bark in fine powder, mixed with three ounces of the de|coction, and a &s;mall quantity of the tincture, which
<PB N="41" REF="56">being a draught well loaded with Bark, at fir&s;t &s;eem|ed to &s;it unea&s;y on the &s;tomach; (which I have &s;e|veral times on being fir&s;t taken, found the ca&s;e with &s;ome of my patients, but which never took from its effect,) but, after re&s;ting for &s;ome time, I found my&s;elf in a &s;tate to continue its u&s;e. My Ague from that time kept off; till, from omitting the Bark two &s;oon, (and finding my&s;elf quite well) in a few weeks after, &s;light &s;ymptoms appeared again; but, which never formed a direct fit, the Bark being again repeated, eradicated the di&s;order.</P>
<P>My father, now in the 70th year of his age, has &s;ince that time been attacked with an Ague; but, from his having been before &s;eized with a chilline&s;s without &s;ub&s;equent &s;ever, &s;uffered him&s;elf to have three fits without trying any remedy: being then convinced of the reality of the Ague, applied to this Bark in decoction, with &s;ome tincture made of the &s;ame; he found it &s;o effectual, that after taking it, the fit did not once return; he omitted the Bark too &s;oon, and had one &s;light fit; but, after repeating
<PB N="42" REF="57">the &s;ame remedy a few days, it has not &s;ince return|ed, and he is now perfectly well.</P>
<P>The patients, who have received immediate re|lief from the <HI>new</HI> Bark, are &s;o numerous, that I cannot with any degree of certainty gue&s;s the number.</P>
<P>The quantity that we have u&s;ed, from <HI>July,</HI> 1781, to the pre&s;ent time, is upwards of &s;ixty pounds. The manner in which we have u&s;ed it, with a view to prevent the return of an approaching paroxy&s;m, is by giving &frac12; a drachm or 1 drachm of the Powder, mixed with two ounces of the decoction, and a &s;mall quantity of the tincture. The decoction we have u&s;ed, has been prepared by boiling three ounces of the gro&s;s powder boiled in two quarts of water to one quart. When the patient has been of a more delicate frame, or when it has been u&s;ed as a corro|borant, we have given the decoction and tincture without the powder. When the Ague has been but recently contracted, we have &s;eldom tru&s;ted to any thing but the Bark, but when &s;tubborn, evacuants
<PB N="43" REF="58">have been fir&s;t given; half an ounce of the pow|der has very frequently cured an Ague without evacuants, or more Bark, when the fit was a re|cent one; we have now entirely left off giving the <HI>old</HI> Bark in any form &s;ince we have found &s;o good effects from the Red Bark, and we u&s;ed the Re&s;in of Red Bark with good &s;ucce&s;s, in ma|ny ca&s;es, where the Patient could take it only in the form of Pills. I heartly hope the above account will prove &s;atisfactory to you, if not I &s;hall think my&s;elf very happy in an&s;wering at any time any future enquiries.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry it is not in my power to &s;end you particular Ca&s;es of the effects of the Red Bark. Having made no memorandums, I can only &s;ay, in general, that it is a much better Kind of Bark, than any I have been able to procure hitherto. Whether the Intermittents have been wor&s;e than common, or the Grey Bark has been of inferior Quality, I will not take upon me to determine; but we were all unu&s;ually foiled in our attempts to cure that Complaint, till we were furni&s;hed with the <HI>New</HI> Bark. I can have no Inducement to give a higher Character of this Drug, than it de|&s;erves: but, I do a&s;&s;ure you, that, &s;ince I began to u&s;e it, it has not once failed me, when the Patient has taken it in a proper manner. Hence, I have a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of its &s;uperior efficacy, and I am the more confirmed in my Opinion, by knowing that my Sentiments corre&s;pond with yours,
<PB N="45" REF="60">and with tho&s;e of all my medical acquaintance, in this Neighbourhood, who have made trial of it.

<HEAD>In addition to the character given of the Red Bark, by &s;everal practitioners in the country, is a letter I received a few days ago from Sir WILLIAM BISHOP, an eminent Surgeon, at <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> dated <HI>June</HI> 16th.</HEAD>
<P>IN which he &s;hews, by a variety of ca&s;es, that in the cure of intermittents, in that part of the world, the Red Bark had not only been infi|nitely more effectual than the common Peruvian Bark, or any other remedy u&s;ually employed, but that it had radically cured where cold bathing, eme|tics, opiates, bitters and friction failed, and where the be&s;t Pale Bark, both by it&s;elf, and with a variety of other medicines, was exhibited without effect, even to the quantity of &s;ixteen ounces. The form he gives it in, is that of an electuary, with the addition of a &s;mall quantity of the e&s;&s;ential oil of pepper-mint and caraway-&s;eed; and he &s;eldom has occa&s;ion, he &s;ays, to u&s;e more than from 4 to 6 ounces. One ca&s;e he mentions, where a &s;phacelus had taken place
<PB N="47" REF="62">in a malignant fever, accompanied with delirium and every other bad &s;ymptom, the patient was re|covered by the u&s;e of the Red Bark, Anodynes, and Wine; the &s;phacelus &s;eparating kindly, the fe|ver and bad &s;ymptoms &s;peedily gave way.</P>

<HEAD>I am likewi&s;e favoured with another let|ter from Sir WILLIAM BISHOP, dated <HI>June</HI> 23d, which contains many &s;en|&s;ible and judicious hints upon this &s;ubject.</HEAD>
<P>HE recommends the grinding Red Bark into the fine&s;t powder by a mill, and afterwards &s;ifting it through the fine&s;t cypre&s;s &s;ieve, in order that it may &s;it lightly on the &s;tomach, and that its parts may be uniformly blended together: he ob&s;erves, that if, after breaking the Bark, you examine the broken pieces, by means of a gla&s;s in the &s;un &s;hine, you will &s;ee the re&s;in like &s;pangles of gold between the internal woody fibres and the outward grey coat; by comparing this appearance with the be&s;t Pale
<PB N="48" REF="63">Bark, you will di&s;cover that the Red Bark contains a much larger quantity of re&s;inous parts.</P>
<P>Two &s;cruples of Bark, as coar&s;ly powdered as is commonly fold by the apothecaries, will be as di&s;a|greable to take, as a drachm or four &s;cruples finely ground. One drachm is the do&s;e he generally gave to an adult, although he &s;ometimes met with pa|tients, who would choo&s;e to take two or three drachms at a do&s;e, and tho&s;e do&s;es, at longer inter|vals; and from experience he found that, when this la&s;t practice agreed with the &s;tomach, it was the mo&s;t effectual way of curing the intermittent. One patient took three oun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es in twelve hours, and had no return of an ob&s;tinate Quartan.</P>
<P>Many Intermittents, which could not be cured by &s;mall do&s;es, were removed by larger do&s;es, more frequently employed.</P>
<P>He mentions that a period of <HI>five</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> hours, before the expected return of a <HI>Quotidian,</HI> or <HI>Ter|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ian</HI> Intermittent, is all that is nece&s;&s;ary for the
<PB N="49" REF="64">taking a &s;ufficient quantity of the Red Bark, in or|der to obviate the approaching Paroxy&s;m. Some have been cured by taking <HI>two</HI> ounces, as quick as po&s;&s;ible after the fit, but &s;uch as per&s;evered in the u&s;e of it, until <HI>four</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> ounces were taken acted mo&s;t prudently, their health was &s;oone&s;t and mo&s;t perfectly re&s;tored. He likewi&s;e ob&s;erves, that &s;uch Per&s;ons ought to take the greate&s;t quan|tity of Bark, who&s;e blood is in the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olved &s;tate, and where the fibres have been relaxed by the mo&s;t profu&s;e &s;weating, which frequently takes place in ob&s;tinate <HI>Quartans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quotidians</HI> require but a &s;mall quantity, <HI>Tertians</HI> will yield to fewer do&s;es than our <HI>Kenti&s;h Quartans.</HI></P>
<P>He found it better to get down <HI>five</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> ounces of Bark, in eight or ten days, than to allow a larger time for the &s;ame quantity. Labouring people, who work out of doors in cold foggy mornings, either in mar&s;hy grounds or wet lands, from &s;un rife till the dew of the evening, and who &s;weat profu&s;ely, and &s;uffer their wet linen to dry on their backs, will not
<PB N="50" REF="65">be &s;afe from a return of the quartan fever, with le&s;s than five ounces taken after the la&s;t fit, as the good effects of all they had taken before, are very pro|bably carried off and di&s;&s;ipated in the en&s;uing paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e ob&s;erves that the Bark in large do&s;es will not cure the irregular fits of an ague and fe|ver, which &s;o often afflicts per&s;ons, when matter is forming in the lungs, in the <HI>Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A letter from Dr. WITHERING, an emi|nent Phy&s;ician, at <HI>Birmingham, June</HI> 29, 1782.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much plea&s;ed, that you have undertaken to give us an account of the Red Peruvian Bark. A Publication upon that &s;ubject, cannot fail to pro|duce good effects, by removing the prejudices of &s;ome, the ignorance of others, and ultimately by exciting our merchants to obtain liberal &s;upplies of a medicine &s;o truly valuable. The univer&s;al pre|valence of intermittent fevers this &s;pring gave us a large experience of its effects. We have not many intermittents in the town of Birmingham; but, in other parts of the county of Warwick, in Stafford|&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire and Oxford&s;hire, &s;o far as my rides extend, they have been more ge|neral than ever known before in the memory of the olde&s;t practitioners I have conver&s;ed with.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="67">
<P>After taking pains to recommend the Red Bark to all the Apothecaries I met with, and con&s;equent|ly not le&s;s anxious to learn their ob&s;ervations re|lative to its effects, I can &s;ay that they unanimou&s;|ly concur in a&s;&s;erting <Q>"that they have never been di&s;appointed in their expectations when they ex|hibited it to Patients labouring under Intermit|tents."</Q></P>
<P>Now the Intermittents which I have &s;een, have pretty generally a&s;&s;umed the Tertian Type in light &s;oils, and the Quartan Type in clayey countries. Of the latter, I have had the care of &s;ome which were from 6 to 18 Months duration, originating in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> I have known two in&s;tances only of Quartans in which the Red Bark did not pre|vent a recurrence of the Fits; I &s;aw one of the&s;e pa|tients afterwards; he laboured under Hepatic and ana&s;arcous &s;ymptoms, the&s;e were removed in a fortnight by the u&s;ual methods, and then the Bark effected a cure. The other ca&s;e was at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from this place, and I have not yet learnt its termination.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="68">
<P>It will require &s;ome farther experience to a&s;cer|tain the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> do&s;es. I know &s;ome practiti|oners who have given one or two drachms every four hours betwixt the fits, but I have never had oc|ca&s;ion to give more than thirty or forty grains at &s;imilar intervals of time.</P>
<P>As to its preparations I can &s;ay but little; pre|ferring always in my own practice the &s;imple pow|der; but, I am told, that it makes a very rich tinc|ture, and, I have &s;een decoctions of it very high coloured and turbid.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked&mdash;would not the common or Quill Bark, have produced &s;imilar good effects in the intermittents of the pre&s;ent year? From the reports of other practitioners; I believe it would not. From my own experience, I can give no other an&s;wer, to &s;uch a que&s;tion, than, by &s;aying, that after frequent and almo&s;t continual di&s;|appointments, from the u&s;e of common Quill Bark, I have not tried to cure a &s;ingle intermittent with it for more than &s;even years pa&s;t; relying en|tirely
<PB N="54" REF="69">upon the u&s;e of evacuants, opium and metallic &s;alts. To render this la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion reconcilable to the daily experience of others, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that with us, a Phy&s;ician is &s;eldom con|&s;ulted in fevers of the intermittent kind, unle&s;s &s;ome unu&s;ual appearance, or &s;ome uncommon ob&s;tinacy in the recurrence of the attack, alarms the patient or his friends.</P>
<P>Whether the medicine in que&s;tion, be the product of the &s;ame tree from which the Quill Bark is de|rived, may be difficult to determine, but I am per|&s;uaded it is the medicine that was u&s;ed by MORTON and SYDEN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">M, or its efficacy could never have been &s;o proverbial. I know not what could fir&s;t induce the writers upon the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> to pre|fer the Quill Bark; but, I know if you were to a&s;k an <HI>Engli&s;h Tanner,</HI> whether the Bark from the trunk; or, that from the twigs of the Oak is the &s;tronge&s;t, he would laugh at your ignorance.</P>
<P>I communicated the contents of your letter, to my worthy friend and colleague Dr. ASH, together
<PB N="55" REF="70">with my opinion upon the &s;ubject: he authori&s;es the to &s;ay that the re&s;ult of his experience perfectly coincides with mine.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain, With the true&s;t e&s;teem, Yours, W. WITHERING.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>A Letter from Mr. SHERWIN, an ingeni|ous Surgeon, at <HI>Enfield.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE we have u&s;ed the Red Peruvian Bark, we have had great &s;ucce&s;s in curing Agues and in|termitting Fevers. The&s;e di&s;orders returned &s;o frequently after the u&s;e of the be&s;t Peruvian Bark, which we could formerly procure that our credit, as
<PB N="57" REF="72">well as that of the medicine, began to fail very much, and numbers of our patients got into the hands of per&s;ons unacquainted with phy&s;ic. They &s;eemed willing to tru&s;t rather to <HI>no&s;trums</HI> and <HI>charms,</HI> than to a medicine which they have &s;een &s;o repeatedly fail, and to the effects of which they very ingeniou&s;ly a&s;cribe every ache and pain which continue after Agues, or which are the con&s;equences of Agues when imperfectly cured.</P>
<P>I could give a very ample detail of the inefficacy of the common Bark; but, as the complaint is ge|neral, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary. I &s;hall therefore, only take the liberty to pre&s;ent you with the more agreeable hi&s;tory of a few ca&s;es that have im|mediately yielded to the Red Peruvian Bark, and that even when given in very moderate do&s;es, after having ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ted large quantities of the other.</P>
<P>RICHARD PARSLEY, a hard working young man, about 28 years of age, was &s;eized with an Ague la&s;t autumn; which continued either as a <HI>Quotidian,
<PB N="58" REF="73">Tertian</HI> or <HI>Quartan,</HI> with very little intermi&s;&s;ion, till the 20th of <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, when I &s;aw him accidentally. He gave me the following account. That he had taken every thing that had been recommended to him; and that his ma&s;ter, a worthy and re&s;pectable gentleman in this neighbourhood, had procured him the advice of different practitioners of phy&s;ic, who had pre&s;cribed Bark for him in large quantities, but without benefit, as the di&s;order always returned with greater violence after it had been check'd a few Days. He added, that the la&s;t medicine, which he had been advi&s;ed to take, was half an ounce of alum boiled in a pint of ale, to half a pint, which he was ordered to repeat three different times, as &s;oon as he felt the Ague approach. He had in this way, he &s;aid, taken &s;even half ounces upon the approach of as many different fits of the Ague.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pected, that &s;o large a quantity of alum, taken at one do&s;e, mu&s;t have produced &s;ome dangerous effects, and doubted whether he had &s;wallowed the whole of it; but, I &s;ound upon more particular en|quiry, that he really &s;wallowed half an ounce each
<PB N="59" REF="74">time; as he &s;ays, that he &s;tirred it up from the bot|tom and felt it gritty in his Teeth. It gave him great pain in his &s;tomach. So large a quantity of Alum being taken at one do&s;e, without materially injuring the &s;y&s;tem, is a fact, which I am per&s;uaded you will think worthy of notice.</P>
<P>I took compa&s;&s;ion upon this poor Fellow, and &s;ent him 8 papers of the Red Peruvian Bark, con|taining a drachm in each, which he fini&s;hed in two intermediate days, the di&s;order being then a Quar|tan. It is now &s;even weeks &s;ince he took this me|dicine, and he has had no return of the complaint, but to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion of his own "hath felt ever &s;ince as if he had a new In&s;ide."</P>
<P>ANNE PIGOT, a poor Girl 14 years old, has been afflicted with an Ague &s;ince Autumn la&s;t in the &s;ame Family with PARSLEY, and has al&s;o tried va|rious medicines without effect. I pre&s;cribed &s;mall do&s;es of the <HI>Vitriolum Coerul.</HI> fourteen days with|out gaining any advantage. I gave her al&s;o 3 or 4 do&s;es of a hot aromatic powder recommended
<PB N="60" REF="75">by Van SWIETEN con&s;i&s;ting of Bay Berries and Chi|na Pepper which I have frequently &s;een to cure, but &s;he found no benefit from it. I cannot &s;ay whether this Girl had given the common Bark a fair trial. She begged to have &s;ome of the &s;ame medicine that cured her Relation, and about a month &s;ince had three papers, containing only one &s;cruple in each, and, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he has been perfectly free from the complaint ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Mr. BARNS, a very &s;trong hard working Man, was &s;eized la&s;t Autumn with a very violent inter|mitting Fever, attended with Delirium, and ap|parently much danger. After three or four par|oxy&s;ms I removed the di&s;order by giving him one drachm of the be&s;t common Peruvian Bark every Hour, and continuing the &s;ame quantity twice a day afterwards; but, at the end of fourteen days, the Fever return'd with the &s;ame violence as be|fore, and was again &s;top'd by the &s;ame quantity of Bark. From Autumn till the beginning of la&s;t <HI>April,</HI> it returned in this manner (at the end of
<PB N="61" REF="76">about fourteen days from the time it was &s;topped) five or &s;ix times and always with uncommon violence. The common Peruvian Bark newly powdered was repeatedly given.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> I pre&s;cribed &s;ix do&s;es, of the Red Peruvian Bark, of one drachm each, which he took upon the going off of the <HI>Paroxy&s;m,</HI> and I have the plea&s;ure to inform you, that, he has had no return &s;ince that time; though I no longer u&s;ed the precaution of continuing the daily u&s;e of the &s;ame medicine.</P>
<P>It is not worth while to mention common ca&s;es, where the Red Bark hath cured without the other having had the trial. A few have occurred, and I have not yet had any in&s;tance of a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>I was lately called to a very &s;evere ca&s;e, like that of Mr. BARNES, where the intermi&s;&s;ion was not longer than 6 or 8 hours. I pre&s;cribed, and the patient took 6 drachms of the Red Bark, with|out interrupting the paroxy&s;m, which came at the
<PB N="62" REF="77">expected hour; and during the &s;ickne&s;s and hor|ripilatio the Bark &s;eemed to be entirely rejected by vomiting; however the &s;ucceeding paroxy&s;m a|bated &s;omething of its fury. My patient was ex|tremely aver&s;e to Bark in every &s;hape; but by de|ceiving him, during the following intermi&s;&s;ion, I got him to &s;wallow two drachms at once, which ren|dered him &s;o entirely aver&s;e to the medicine, that he would take no more afterwards. However, to his great joy, and my &s;urpri&s;e, the &s;ever left him. He a&s;cribes his cure to three or four draughts of camphorated julep, which were pre&s;cribed as a <HI>pla|cebo</HI> upon his refu&s;ing to per&s;evere in the u&s;e of the Bark. But it may with more ju&s;tice be a&s;cribed to the two drachms of Red Bark, taken at one do&s;e; as I think the fir&s;t &s;ix were in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the Red Peruvian Bark as a valuable acqui&s;ition to the <HI>Materia Medica:</HI> or, perhaps it may be only a re&s;toration of what was u&s;ed in the days of SYDENHAM, and &s;ome time after, when it was common for medical writers to &s;ay, that this, or that medicine would cure, with as much certainty as
<PB N="63" REF="78">Bark would an Ague. An eulogium to which the Bark in this country has not been of late years entitled.</P>
<P>Before I became acquainted with the &s;uperior efficacy of the Red Peruvian Bark, I had tried a variety of <HI>tonics,</HI> with very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s in ge|neral, but now and then with very happy effects, &s;uch as the <HI>Cuprum Ammoniacum, Vitriolum Coeru|leum, Sal Vitrioli, Sal Martis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WILLIAM KING, an athletic young man, ap|plied to me la&s;t autumn, on account of a tedi|ous irregular intermittent, complicated with acute fixed pain in the &s;ide, and a full &s;trong pul&s;e&punc; much cough and hoar&s;ene&s;s. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I thought it imprudent to admini&s;ter the Bark in any Form and had recour&s;e to a plentiful bleeding, ap|plying bli&s;ters to the part affected, and giving the <HI>Decoct. Taraxac.</HI> with <HI>Tart. Solubile,</HI> and honey in large quantities. The di&s;order was clearly an Ague; but attended with &s;ymptoms that threatened a pulmonary con&s;umption. His blood was re|markably
<PB N="64" REF="79">&s;izy, which induced me to make u&s;e of <HI>vene&s;ection</HI> four times, which with the above medi|cines, and a very &s;trict <HI>antiphlogi&s;tic</HI> regimen, re|moved the cough and pain in the &s;ide, though the Ague &s;till continued. I ventured at la&s;t to give him eight do&s;es of common Bark, one drachm in each, which removed the Ague &s;everal weeks, and mended his habit much. A continuance of the Bark, twice a day, for &s;ometime after the Ague &s;topped, brought on a frequent bleeding at the no&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ague returned twice during the winter; but gave way &s;oon to the &s;ame Bark, and he kept tolerably well till the &s;etting-in of cold north-ea&s;t winds in &s;pring, when his Ague again returned, and brought with it the pain in the &s;ide, a bloated icteric countenance, much hoar&s;ene&s;s and cough. After one more bleeding and the u&s;e of the <HI>Apozem</HI> for a month, I gave him &s;ix drachms of the Red Peru|vian Bark in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, and have had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee him continue free from the Ague &s;ince that time, though be never repeated the do&s;e after it &s;topped.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="80">
<P>I was unwilling to per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of the Bark after the Ague &s;topped le&s;t it &s;hould encrea&s;e the circulation too much and again excite a bleeding at the no&s;e.</P>
<P>I have now indeed almo&s;t entirely laid a&s;ide the cu&s;tom of per&s;evering in the u&s;e of the Bark after the intermittent is &s;topped. I have for &s;ometime &s;u&s;pected that it an&s;wers no good purpo&s;e, and that it may po&s;&s;ibly now and then be the rea&s;on why large quantities of good Bark have been given in vain. It is a well known Fact, that every species of intermittent complaint frequently returns in four|teen days after being interrupted by means of Bark, notwith&s;tanding that medicine is continued every day. May not the daily u&s;e of Bark &s;o habituate the con&s;titution to its effect as to render it u&s;ele&s;s when the Intermittent returns?</P>
<P>I am now &s;atisfied when I have put a &s;top to the expected paroxy&s;m, and pre&s;cribe an anodyne to be in readine&s;s if ever the cold fit returns, advi&s;ing my patient to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame quantity of
<PB N="66" REF="81">Bark which he found nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, and to take it as &s;oon as the &s;ucceeding &s;ever abates. I adopt|ed this practice a little time before I became ac|quainted with the &s;uperior efficacy of the Red Bark, and thought it an improvement, but &s;ince that time I have &s;ucceeded &s;o well by giving &s;ix or eight drachms between the paroxy&s;ms that I have &s;eldom had occa&s;ion to repeat a &s;ingle do&s;e.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>A Letter from Dr. FOTHERGILL, an eminent Phy&s;ician, in <HI>Harpur Street.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an&s;wer to your obliging reque&s;t, I &s;hall now proceed to lay before you, the be&s;t informa|tion I can concerning the New Bark, lately intro|duced into practice, under the name of CORTEX RUBER OR RED BARK. As it was found on board a Spani&s;h prize intermixed with a &s;mall quantity of common Peruvian Bark, it would &s;eem to be no other than the produce of the trunk or large branches of the &s;ame tree. It &s;eems to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible qualities only in a much higher degree, hence it yields a much larger proportion of re&s;i|nous extract, and gives a more &s;aturated tincture, and decoction than the common Bark. Hence too I have found (according to what you lately ob|&s;erved) that the decoction may be expo&s;ed a long time to the open air, without contracting the de|gree of acidity, which manife&s;tly takes place in that of the common Bark in a few days.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="83">
<P>It has been remarked for many years pa&s;t, that the Peruvian Bark has often di&s;appointed the ex|pectation of the public; having fallen greatly &s;hort of that high degree of efficacy, for which writers of the la&s;t century, have &s;o highly extolled it. Few Phy&s;icians of exten&s;ive practice, but mu&s;t &s;ometimes have had the mortification to ob&s;erve their favou|rite &s;pecific entirely baffled by a regular intermit|tent, without being able to a&s;&s;ign any probable cau&s;e of the defeat, except the <HI>ungenuinene&s;s</HI> of the medi|cine; Whence it would &s;eem to follow, either that the intermittents of late years, have been more <HI>ob&s;ti|nate</HI> in their nature, or that the Bark has been of an <HI>inferior quality</HI> to that which was u&s;ed by Dr. SYDEN|HAM, and many of his re&s;pectable contemporaries, of who&s;e veracity we can entertain no rea&s;onable doubt. The latter appears to me to be the more probable, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that of late years, it has been cu&s;tomary (for what rea&s;on I cannot imagine) to &s;elect the Bark of the &s;mall branches, under the denomination of <HI>Quilled</HI> Bark, in preference to that of the trunks. Should this preference hereafter be di&s;covered to have been
<PB N="69" REF="84">groundle&s;s, (agreeable to what I have long &s;u&s;pected) it may perhaps contribute to explain the principle cau&s;e of our di&s;appointments. In the art of tan|ning, experience has long determined in favour of large Oak Bark, as being greatly preferable to that of the &s;maller twigs. Why the rever&s;e of this &s;hould take place in a medicinal view, is by no means evi|dent, e&s;pecially if the virtue of the Peruvian Bark keeps pace in any degree with its a&s;tringency.</P>
<P><HI>Spani&s;h</HI> practitioners, as I have been lately in|formed, are &s;o well convinced of this, that they al|ways prefer the large Peruvian Bark; &s;eparating it from the &s;maller &s;ort, for all important purpo&s;es, of which the late capture indeed &s;eems to afford a proof.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This mu&s;t not however be confounded with tho&s;e coar&s;e woody flakes, which con&s;titute a large proportion of the wor&s;t kind of Bark, now in u&s;e. For the&s;e, hav|ing been already &s;tripped of the outer rind, con&s;i&s;t of a mere ligneous &s;ub&s;tance dive&s;ted of re&s;in, and con&s;equent|ly of medioinal virtue.</NOTE> Future ob&s;ervations may probably di&s;cover that this was the real genuine Bark, with which our ance&s;tors cured all the various kinds of Intermit|tents,
<PB N="70" REF="85">with a degree of certainty, which now a&s;to|ni&s;hes their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>If Bark taken from the large branches &s;hould be &s;ound to be more efficacions than that of the &s;mall, is it not rea&s;onable to believe, that, that of the trunk, or rather of the root, might &s;urpa&s;s both in virtue? Political rea&s;ons, however, re&s;pecting the pre&s;erva|tion of the trees, which produce &s;o important an article of commerce, will, it is to be apprehended effectually deter the inhabitants from every experi|ment of this nature.</P>
<P>A very eminent Druggi&s;t, who purcha&s;ed a large &s;hare of the above cargo, a&s;&s;ures me, that many of the Apothecaries whom he has &s;upplied with the Red Bark, and who have carefully compared its ef|fects with tho&s;e of the common <HI>cortex,</HI> make no &s;cruple of deciding in its favour. He further adds that the demand for it has increa&s;ed &s;o rapidly of late, that the &s;tock in hand is already nearly ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="86">
<P>It is to be regretted that the pa&s;&s;ion for interlard|ing this &s;imple febrifuge with other bitters and a&s;|tringents (after the u&s;ual mode of practice) but &s;till too much prevails! Under this fal&s;e idea of ad|ding to its efficacy, its virtue may often be greatly dimini&s;hed, and at all events, the re&s;ult of the trial mu&s;t be rendered extremely equivocal. In ju&s;tice to the remedy, and to obviate this uncertainty concerning its effects, I have embraced every op|portunity (which &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace would admit,) of admini&s;tring it in its &s;imple &s;tate, without intermix|ing it with other medicines. The ca&s;es in which I have chiefly tried it, have been low putrid Fevers, attended with extreme pro&s;tration of &s;trength, deli|rium during the evening exacerbations, with &s;hort, and ob&s;cure remi&s;&s;ions in the day time. In one in|&s;tance of this kind, <HI>Petechiae</HI> appeared, and were &s;uc|ceeded by a <HI>na&s;al haemorrhage,</HI> which generally re|turned with the exacerbations, till the patients &s;trength &s;eemed to be nearly exhau&s;ted, accompa|nied with cold &s;weats, and involuntary twitchings, &amp;c. His narrow e&s;cape from this mo&s;t critical &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="72" REF="87">I attribute to a liberal u&s;e of this Bark, and aci|dulated liquors drank copiou&s;ly. From its &s;ucce&s;s in this, and &s;everal other in&s;tances, which have fal|len under my own ob&s;ervation, I am &s;trongly in|clined to believe that it will &s;oon become an object worthy of attention, but mu&s;t decline, giving a deci&s;ive opinion concerning its &s;uperiority, till I know the re&s;ult of a variety of ca&s;es, in which it is now under trial, and al&s;o receive additi|onal confirmation from &s;uch corre&s;pondents, as are le&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in its favour than my&s;elf, be|cau&s;e they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ove in reality more impartial judges. Therefore in the interim, I &s;hall wait with impatience for your intended publication, hoping that by thus collecting the &s;entiments, and ob&s;ervations of &s;everal practitioners in different parts of the kingdom, we may at length be enabled to a&s;certain the true comparative merit of the <HI>Red Bark,</HI> which cannot but afford great &s;atisfaction to the public at large, as well as to,</P>
