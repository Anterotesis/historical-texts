<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN &s;earch of Things, laudable and prai&s;e|worthy, <HI>Ambition</HI> is a <HI>Vertue.</HI> Prior to other Men, tho&s;e of our Profe&s;&s;ion are required to pur&s;ue their Progre&s;&s;ive Improvement in this Ca&s;e; but we mu&s;t climb the Hill; Vertue &s;its o' Top. Care is painful; the Charge of Men, and Women's Lives, and Limbs revolves
<PB N="2" REF="9">the Surgeon's Brea&s;t. To retain his Tranquility he is to proceed in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, according to the re|ceived Maxims, and approved Me|thod of the be&s;t Practitioners. Learning gives Tranquility of Mind; it points the Road to Re|putation and Riches.</P>
<P>IT is a Maxim among Infidels to &s;peak well of all Men as far as Vertue will permit; Slander is ba&s;e, and does recriminate. It is far from me to derogate from the Ma&s;ters of your Ho&s;pital,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Tho&mdash; s.</NOTE> but who among &s;uch Folks imparts his Knowledge, and if they do, ought not young Men to proceed in their Re&s;earch: Reputation lo&s;t, is hardly retrieva|ble; we are not to ri&s;k this ra&s;hly: On the other Hand, the World is apt to form a great Idea of a Sur|geon of an enterprizing Genius; they pre&s;ume that his Knowledge
<PB N="3" REF="10">is well founded; &s;o they may, be|ing attended with Succe&s;s. Te|merity puts a Man off his Guard; this is &s;ubject to great Danger.</P>
<P>THE Reduction of Fractures, and Di&s;locations is a great and nece&s;&s;ary Article in a Surgeon's Bu&s;ine&s;s; to decline this, is incon&s;i&s;tent with his Character, &s;ee him&s;elf po&s;tponed to a country Fellow, in all other re&s;|pects inferior to him. Granting that many of tho&s;e People &s;et Bones at random, you will not ea&s;ily be believed in &s;aying &s;o, even when they mi&s;carry. There is Rea&s;on to retort, that good Surgeons fail in this Ca&s;e, tho' Men are required to &s;peak Truth, it would be a Hard&s;hip on Surgeons to tell all which they know, or believe: they would confe&s;s that &s;ometimes the Swelling confounds them in di&s;tingui&s;hing the Species of Frac|tures,
<PB N="4" REF="11">particularly Luxations. This Reflection ought to put young Sur|geons under an indi&s;pen&s;ible Ob|ligation to di&s;tingui&s;h the great Variety al&s;o of Sub Luxations, and be familiarly conver&s;ant with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">her Rules of Art, to arm again&s;t C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ngencies. When you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">n in&s;tructed in the <HI>O&s;teology,</HI> the <HI>Myology,</HI> and the <HI>Angiology,</HI> the Hi&s;tory of the Bones, the Mu&s;|cles, and the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, you will cut without Danger, by the Di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Re-place of the Head of the Bone, &s;ee how and where the Mu&s;cles and Ligaments are banded, and relaxed; then from the in|ten&s;e Pain, the privation of Mo|tion, and the Po&s;ition, judge where the Di&s;tortion is made, notwith|&s;tanding the Swelling. This Rule will direct you in adju&s;ting the Ex|ten&s;ion, and in moderating the Vi|olence.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<P>WHEN the Femur, the Thigh, is di&s;located backward; I mean when the Head of the Bone is un|der the <HI>Gluti,</HI> or <HI>Fle&s;hchi,</HI> the three Exten&s;or Mu&s;cles of the Fe|mur, all Authors, as well as other Surgeons, agree, few contradict, that the Reduction is impractible, by Rea&s;on that the Head of the Bone cannot be removed; e&s;pecially in that the Ligament, <HI>Tar&s;or,</HI> being broke, the Bone will not keep in it's Place: I will demon&s;trate how this Luxati|on may be reduced, and by what Means the Ligament re&s;tored.</P>
<P>RULES will be given re&s;pect|ing Fractures, particularly the Ob|lique, and Tran&s;ver&s;e-Fracture of the Femur, the Thigh bone, which cannot be felt, by Rea&s;on afore|&s;aid.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<P>EXCELLENT Directions Will be given to keep the Com|pound-Fracture free from Pain, and without the exfoliating the Bone, cure the Wound with Facili|ty, and Promptitude. In depart|ing from the&s;e Rules the menacing Accidents ri&s;ing high, the Life of the Di&s;ea&s;ed is ca&s;t away, or hangs in doubt.</P>
<P>YOU will be apprized of an Er|ror in a reputed great Author:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;eman.</NOTE> this for many Years has been a &s;tum|bling Block to his Practi&s;ing-Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, and &s;ometimes fatal to the Subject, if he e&s;caped with his Life, he underwent a long Weakne&s;s, and not &s;eldom a Deformity in his Limb. I am acquainted with a Gentleman, a &s;hameful Example of this Error in two great Surgeons in Concert, one of them a Grandee of the fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="14">Cla&s;s; the Afflicted deplores the Remembrance of his Sorrow, and the Lo&s;s of the U&s;e of his Elbow; the&s;e in a great Mea&s;ure might have been prevented, with no danger of his Life, or Lamene&s;s, little Pain, lo&s;s of Time, or Expence compara|tive.</P>
<P>BY the Indication of the Pul&s;e, and of the Urine, you may betimes animate your Dige&s;tive, then by change of Dre&s;&s;ing turn gradu|ally the redundant Di&s;charge to In|carn the Wound, and generate, and confirm the Callous: This Practice mu&s;t needs be ju&s;t, &s;eeing that by certain Tokens in the Matter or Di&s;charge, this is known to be the Chyle, and indeed the native Balm of the Blood which cures all Wounds. In this Ca&s;e, Old People &s;eldom recover their Strength; the Spirit and Bal&s;am of the Blood is
<PB N="8" REF="15">evaporated: This is become Cadave|rous.</P>
<P>IF I do not take upon me to determine the controverted Hypo|the&s;es in Theory, it is not improba|ble but in this I &s;hall make a plea|&s;ing Advance.</P>
<P>IN this Sentiment you will find your&s;elf in Condition to di&s;tin|gui&s;h Books; was I to &s;peak my Opinion of them, I mu&s;t own that there are not many worth reading. It is not hard to comprize in a Sheet or two of Paper, what is ma|terial in &s;ome of the be&s;t of them, particularly tho&s;e of the Practice of Surgery.</P>
<P>WITH a copious, and beauti|ful Variety of Topics, you &s;hall have the Occa&s;ional Method of In|ternal Pre&s;cription, to dige&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="16">Wounds of the Brain, and Wounds of the <HI>Vi&s;cera.</HI> Of all other, Gun&s;hot Wounds in the Joints are formidable to Nature. Application of actua|ting, fortifying, and re&s;olutive Me|decines of various Kinds not ge|nerally known are to be made ac|cording to the Exigency of the Wound: the Surgeon is to &s;teer his Cour&s;e, as it were, between <HI>Cha|rybdis</HI> and <HI>Scylla,</HI> a Rock, and a Sand, as they term it. Without adding Fewel to the burning Fe|ver, he is to cheri&s;h the <HI>Genus Ner|vo&s;am;</HI> from thence the intere&s;|&s;ing Soul &s;ends continually Suc|cours of Animal Spirits in Aid of Nature in the unequal War with her united cruel Enemies Pain, Fever, Thir&s;t, Burning, Watching, Delirium. In Failure of the&s;e Spi|rits to rarify, and animate the con|den&s;ing Blood, to dige&s;t the Wound, alleviate the Pain, and &s;upport or
<PB N="10" REF="17">&s;trengthen the Heart, labouring under the redoubling Pul&s;e, the mortal Symptoms prevailing; the noble Organs cea&s;ing to perform their Vital and Animal Functions, the Soul deprived of her Power, is forced to depart.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hould learn to de&s;pamate, &s;ecern, and transfer the dangerous Rellux of purulent Matter oppre&s;|&s;ing the Blood, and Animal Spirits with Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, Fever, <HI>Delirium,</HI> the Hickok, Lethargy, Apoplexy, Convul&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Harbinger of Death.</P>
<P>UPON a &s;udden Suppre&s;&s;ion of Sweat &s;ometimes this becomes a Hetorene Humour, and with pun|gent Pain vellicats the <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> the <HI>Mi&s;&s;entory,</HI> the <HI>Pleura,</HI> the <HI>Media&s;tinum,</HI> the <HI>Pericranium,</HI> and other Parts greatly &s;ubject to
<PB N="11" REF="18">Re&s;entment. Of all Ca&s;es this em|bara&s;&s;es the Surgeon; Secretion be|ing the Work of Nature he cannot appoint the Time, nor till this is accompli&s;hed hardly obtain a Re&s;|pite, or Ce&s;&s;ation of the Violence: This &s;eems to have been the late Ca&s;e of a great King which for what we could perceive his Phy&s;icians and Surgeons knew, yet like a <HI>Starro&s;t</HI> with his Hand on his Sabre in Se|nate, they were for defending their Argument in the Antichamber.</P>
<P><HI>Laudanum</HI> is our great Anodyne, this we are forbid; it re&s;trains the Transfu&s;ion of the Animal Spirits on which depends the Function and Formality of the Parts, al&s;o the Energy of the &s;ecerning Blood. A continued U&s;e of this Medicine may render the Di&s;ea&s;e incurable, or of a long Duration. Purging and Bleeding interrupt Nature: She has cho&s;e to deliver her&s;elf by
<PB N="12" REF="19">the denographical, or culicular Glands, and will not be controuled. Per&s;pirating, Alexipharmic, and Volatile Medicines are of a little Effect till towards the <HI>Cri&s;is;</HI> Na|ture alone maintains the Conflict; Hence it happens that &s;ometimes &s;he does not overcome till from a Vernal Sol&s;tice chiefly, the Blood has received an Acce&s;&s;ion of Warmth to ferment, and di&s;charge in the Surface.</P>
<P>SOME Years ago I tended a Gen|tleman who upon drinking cold Water when hot, and Sweating was &s;eized with a violent Pain in the nervous Tunicle of his Bowels. After a tedious Indi&s;po&s;ition a large Ab&s;ce&s;s was formed in his Groin. Tho' I opened the Swelling as &s;oon as it fluctuated: The Blood and Spirits were &s;o tainted, and charged with this foreign Humour,
<PB N="13" REF="20">that he had an accelerated, a low, and an irregular Pul&s;e; was delirious, had cold clam Sweatings, an Hic|kok, a Diarrhea and a Gangarene round the Border of the Wound; al&s;o an advanced Mortification on the In&s;ide of That Knee. In five or &s;ix Days the Wound di&s;charged &s;o many Quarts of a lixive, ganger Lymph: When the Mortification was &s;topt and a Separation made one might turn his Hand in the Wound quite to the <HI>Peritoneum</HI> in &s;ight. Now the mortal Symptoms began to remit: In le&s;s than five Weeks the Wound was &s;icatrized. You will agree that the Cure depend|ed on proper Internals; had there been a Defect in the Dre&s;&s;ings he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, &s;o he would had I fatigued him with Pain.</P>
<P>BETWEEN two and three Years ago, one Mrs <HI>Gyles,</HI> had for
<PB N="14" REF="21">Year before, a continual Diarrhea, or <HI>Lienterria;</HI> the Chyle, or Nou|ri&s;hment, ran off, the greate&s;t Part of it before it entered the Lacteals. In the Spring of the Year a large, cold, white, fluctuating Swelling grew on her right <HI>Hypondria</HI> be|low the Ribs. From the begin|ning &s;he had an aching Pain &s;hoot|ing deep into the Liver; the Seat or Source of her Indi&s;po&s;ition; a &s;uppre&s;&s;ed Sweat transferred. A con&s;iderable Surgeon in Town told her to be well advi&s;ed in whom &s;he tru&s;ted, and that he did not o|pen the Swelling too &s;oon. In a|bout a Week I &s;topt the Loo&s;ne&s;s: In eight, or nine Days more the Swelling became warm, and red|di&s;h, but frightfully increa&s;ed in Bigne&s;s: I told her now was the Time; &s;he yielding, I opened the Swelling with a Lancet; there was a Ba&s;on of a Quart and half a Pint of
<PB N="15" REF="22">formed Matter catcht; here and there &s;treaked with Blood, toward the End. She, and others who &s;aw the &s;hifted Cloths and Bedding did believe that in 48 Hours the Wound did run a Gallon, and in four Nights two Quarts more; in all Six Quarts. The Return of the Diarrhea was what I apprehended mo&s;t: This happened the fir&s;t Night attended with cold, clam Sweating, a trembling Pul&s;e, and Fainting; &s;o again the &s;econd Night; and were as often taken off. In few Days more &s;he mended daily, and in three Weeks was quite well: Then &s;he grew Fat, Healthful, and Strong. She is lately married to <HI>James Taylor,</HI> a White-&s;mith in <HI>Hatfield-&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>IN five Weeks I cured a Gentle|woman of a large Mortification in her Loins extending on the <HI>Os
<PB N="16" REF="23">Sacrum,</HI> and the <HI>Coxis,</HI> to affect the Sphinctures of the <HI>Anus,</HI> and the Bladder, cut off the Cour&s;e of the Spirits, that &s;he rendered her Ex|crements involuntary. In the be|ginning &s;he had a Fever of the Spi|rits, a Delirium, cold Sweatings, and a Syncopa.</P>
<P>THESE Cures well under&s;tood, and the Medicines given will, with Variations, be a Precedent in many Grand Ca&s;es; nor are the Internal Things mentioned in any Book on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; yet which no Phy|ci&s;ian, or Surgeon, &s;peaking with|out Prejudice, can di&s;avow: They will, and mu&s;t needs own that if any one ever was, the&s;e People, all of them by Medicine, were brought back from the Gates of the Grave.</P>
<P>WHAT de&s;erves Remark; there was no Ruburb, or A&s;tringent, no
<PB N="17" REF="24">Opiate, or Theriaca given in the Diarrhea, the Cortex &s;u&s;pends, or re&s;trains Secretion; &s;o does <HI>Lau|danum:</HI> This &s;huts the Avenues of the Nerves, binding, or cente|ring the Animal Spirits, it leavens the Blood, and oppo&s;es Dige&s;tion and Re-union. I &s;hall occa&s;ionally &s;peak farther of the&s;e Medicines, and how they may be given &s;afely; here they would have been mortal by Rea&s;on of the Nervous Fever.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;e of a Collection in the <HI>Media&s;tinum, De Verney</HI> &s;ays we may trepan the <HI>Sternum.</HI> He was Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy in the Roy|al Garden at <HI>Paris,</HI> and probably the greate&s;t that ever lived, taken throughout. He Illu&s;trated his De|mon&s;trations of all Parts of the Body with his comparative Anatomy of Hor&s;es, Calves, Dogs, Cats, Fowl, Fi&s;h, Frogs, Eggs; including his
<PB N="18" REF="25">public Lectures, and Cour&s;e of Operations. His Cour&s;e of Anato|my la&s;ted from the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> till the end of <HI>March,</HI> all the Week (Sundays, and Holidays excepted) from Morning till Night, an Hour at Noon allowed. He was Forty Years Royal-Profe&s;&s;or; had read all valuable Books; was thought to be one of the greate&s;t Orators in <HI>France.</HI> Being of ea&s;y Acce&s;s his Scholars had a fair Op|portunity of Improvement. His Papers would have made a Volume little le&s;s than a Church-Bible; but they never were publi&s;hed. Few can judge of the Lo&s;s, yet this may ea&s;ily be perceived in the Defects, and Impertinencies in Mens Di&s;|cour&s;e and Writings on this Sub|ject, &s;ome who hold their Heads high.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Swelling in your Lady's Throat is what Surgeons call the <HI>Bronchocele,</HI> or <HI>Hernia Gutterii;</HI> but to &s;peak in particular; I &s;ay it is a Di&s;tention of the Glands <HI>Thyroides.</HI> They are two in Number &s;ituated on the oppo&s;ite Sides of the <HI>Larynx,</HI> and the &s;upe|rior Part of the <HI>A&s;pira Arteria</HI> &s;inking to the flexible Part of the <HI>Anular Cartilages.</HI> The u&s;e of the&s;e Glands is to &s;train from the Blood, a vicous glairous Liquor, to lubrify the <HI>Cartilages</HI> of the <HI>Larynx</HI> to facilitate their Motion. They as well as other Glands are greatly &s;ubject to cold Defluxions. They are the principal Fountains,
<PB N="36" REF="43">and Recervatories of the <HI>Lympha.</HI> Thus we may believe that this cold Humour is al&s;o &s;ent thither from the &s;alivary Sources, and other Glands adjacent. It is ea&s;y to think that as the <HI>Thyroides</HI> Glands &s;well, and take up a greater &s;pace, they pre&s;s the flexible part of the <HI>Anular Cartilages</HI> afore&s;aid, oblig|ing them to yield; they &s;traiten the <HI>Trachia Arteria:</HI> This occa&s;i|ons the great Difficulty of Breath|ing, and threatning of Suffoca|tion.</P>
<P>ON this principle we render Rea&s;on for the lo&s;s of her Voice: The Recrurent Nerves &s;uffers a Com|pre&s;&s;ion: Animal Spirits are want|ing in the Mu&s;cles to play the Car|tilages of the <HI>Larynx</HI> to form the Voice. She is wor&s;e when with Child, on Account that the Blood and Humours are more determined
<PB N="37" REF="44">to the &s;uperior Parts, e&s;pecially in that as the <HI>Abdomen</HI> grows big it pre&s;&s;es the <HI>Diaphragma</HI> again&s;t the Lungs, &s;o le&s;&s;ens the Capacity of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and hinders Re&s;pi|ration. Parallel to this is the Ca&s;e of Drop&s;ical People alway oppre&s;t with &s;hortne&s;s of Breath: I mean in the true A&s;cites when the low|er Belly is filled with Water.</P>
<P>THE great Swelling gives Rea|&s;on to believe that the whole Sub|&s;tance of the&s;e Glands is &s;apped, and di&s;tended with this cold Hu|mour like a &s;punge in Water; the &s;ojourn of which has rendered their Texture &s;o extremely lax, that they will not recover their Re&s;ort; con|&s;equently not admit of cure. Hence it is hard to promi&s;e more than to prevent an Extremity; for which if Purging, Bleeding, e&s;pe|&s;ially Sweating, fortifying, di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing,

<P>NOW the Lines, or Lineaments of the Conception begin to unfold, and range by the increa&s;ing Blood pu&s;hing.</P>
<P>IN This manner the Concepti|on becomes an <HI>Embryo,</HI> and this a <HI>Foetus</HI> which by Degrees growing to Maturity, and &s;traitened for want of Room, the <HI>Placenta</HI> al&s;o &s;eparat|ing, falling away like ripe Fruit, or Leaves from a Tree, the Infant &s;eeks to di&s;lodge: Bearing on the Neck of the Womb, the Weight rai&s;es the Throws of Labour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> Bleeding.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the Ob&s;ervation which I have made on many Peoples Arms, and the great Accidents which happen often, it is evident that the Danger in Bleeding is lit|tle under&s;tood, few know how to &s;hun it. You &s;hall learn to Bleed ea&s;y, and be made ab&s;olutely &s;afe in all Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>WAS the U&s;e of the <HI>Curve-Ca|theter</HI> generally known, and prac|ti&s;ed it would in a great Mea&s;ure &s;et a&s;ide the cruel Operation of Cut|ting for the Stone. Having Re|cour&s;e to this In&s;trument, few would expo&s;e to &s;o doubtful an Event.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="60">
<P>THE Reverend Mr <HI>John Rich|ard&s;on,</HI> Preceptor to <HI>Bapti&s;t Noel</HI> Earl of <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> was for ma|ny Years almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly tor|mented with a Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine, and Strangury from a Stone in the Bladder. Sometimes he has &s;taggered about the Room with con|vul&s;ive Pain.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t time that I introducted my <HI>Curve-Catheter</HI> he urined through this In&s;trument, and the Pain did remit. Next Day I turned a &s;econd Time the ragged Stone on the Smooth Part, and his Pain and Provocation went off. Excepting &s;ome &s;hort Fits of Pain, and Stran|gury he urined regularly for three Months. In u&s;ing may <HI>Cathe|ter</HI> in this Manner <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Times a Year, he enjoyed a Life of Tranquility for Six Years till
<PB N="54" REF="61">he died, 1706. He was Fellow of <HI>Emanuel</HI> College in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and his Vindication of the <HI>Canon</HI> of the New <HI>Te&s;tament,</HI> will perpetuate his Venerable Character in the learned World.</P>
<P>HOW many are tormented with a Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine, and Strangury from drinking Stale Beer, or prickt Wine, &s;ometimes an Ob&s;truction happens from an Excre&s;cence in the Neck of the Bladder, or in the <HI>Urethra.</HI> In all which Ca&s;es the afflicted may expect.

<P>I glide this In&s;trument under the <HI>Pubis</HI> into the Bladder, with either Hand from above-below, or below-above, without Pain, or Blood even in fencing with the Stone, if the Pa&s;&s;age be not al|ready excoriated. With this In&s;tru|ment
<PB N="55" REF="62">we pu&s;h the Stone twice with the <HI>Curve,</HI> the <HI>Conoex</HI> and the <HI>Concave</HI> Part having as it were a greater hold, this gives a better Chance to turn the Stone than when they &s;trike with the Point of the <HI>Strait-Catheter.</HI> Now the Stone returns on the ragged Side to keep up the Pain, and Provoca|tion.</P>
