<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE, CAUSE, and CURE OF THE CROUP.</HEAD>
<P>THE Science of Medicine has been, gradually, advancing for the&s;e two thou&s;and years by pa&s;t; and is now brought to a great degree of improve|ment; perhaps to as great a degree, every circum&s;tance con&s;idered, as the difficulty of the art, the limitation of the human facul|ties, and the continual attempts to further refinement, too often conducted merely by fancy, will admit of.</P>
<P>ONE u&s;ed to con&s;ider the progre&s;s of the different arts, their gradual advancement to perfection, and their &s;ub&s;equent decay, may
<PB N="4" REF="3">be apt to contemplate, with &s;ome alarm, the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of phy&s;ic. More attention is paid to the cla&s;&s;ing of di&s;ea&s;es, as if they were natural and permanent entities, than to the complete hi&s;tory of each particular one; more to the &s;ub-divi&s;ion and &s;plitting of them into &s;eparate &s;pecies, from &s;ome &s;light difference in the &s;ymptoms, than to the general turn and complexion of the whole di&s;ea&s;e; more to the novelty and change of application, than to the improve|ment of what is already di&s;covered and in u&s;e. The&s;e, a &s;peculative mind will be apt to con&s;ider as proofs of too great refine|ment, and di&s;tant marks of a future change.</P>
<P>IT is by a clo&s;e attention to the hi&s;tory of particular di&s;ea&s;es, that the &s;cience has made &s;uch great advances. The accuracy of ancient and modern authors hath left few di&s;ea&s;es untouched. By de&s;cribing every circum&s;tance belonging to them, and the appearances, which occurred, on in&s;pecting the bodies after death, they have a&s;certain|ed mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, and laid a foundation for arriving at as certain a knowledge of the
<PB N="5" REF="4">re&s;t, as the narrow limits of our powers will allow. For ca&s;es in medicine are the expe|riments of this branch of Natural Philo&s;o|phy.</P>
<P>THERE is one di&s;ea&s;e, however, which had entirely e&s;caped all regular examina|tion; and concerning which, there was lit|tle to be learned by inquiry, and &s;till le&s;s from books; I mean the CROUP. I never have &s;een any thing written on this &s;ubject, except a The&s;is, where the author gives us no facts; and cla&s;&s;es it among&s;t the &s;pa&s;modic di&s;tempers, to which it has no re&s;emblance, either in its progre&s;s or cure. The <HI>Catarrhus &s;uffocativus</HI> of <HI>Etmuller,</HI> tho' it re&s;embles the Croup in many particulars, yet appears to be a very different di&s;ea&s;e in &s;ome &s;ymptoms, in the cure, and appearances after deaths.</P>
<P>DR <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> in his Oeconomy of Nature, de&s;cribes, in a few lines, a di&s;ea&s;e very &s;imilar to this, in mo&s;t of its &s;ymptoms: But it &s;eems not exactly the &s;ame, as it was attended with ulcers about the larynx, and terminated of|ten in a &s;phacelus of the lungs. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="6" REF="5">had it been the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e with our Croup, the &s;ame appearances mu&s;t have occurred, upon di&s;&s;ection, to him as to us.</P>
<P>I SHALL, therefore, treat this di&s;ea&s;e as entirely unknown as to its nature, cau&s;e, effects, and cure; and try how far our facts will carry us towards a di&s;covery of the&s;e.</P>
<P>How &s;o &s;ingular and dangerous a di&s;ea&s;e has been totally neglected, while &s;uch atten|tion has been paid to mo&s;t others, is not the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tance belonging to it. Its external features ought to have been &s;uf|ficient to have rou&s;ed an inqui&s;itive &s;earcher into di&s;ea&s;es; its internal appearances, if but once &s;een, mu&s;t have rai&s;ed, from their &s;in|gularity, the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to investigate its nature. But the&s;e &s;eem to have been more than counterbalanced by its local &s;ituation; the unfrequency of its appearance; the &s;ub|jects which it attacked, the&s;e being general|ly children, and unable to give a di&s;tinct ac|count of their complaints; the rapidity of its cour&s;e; the apparent ea&s;ine&s;s of its &s;ymp|toms; and their &s;imilitude to other catarrhal
<PB N="7" REF="6">or peripneumoniac di&s;tempers. The&s;e &s;eem to be &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for its being &s;o long undi&s;tingui&s;hed and unde&s;cribed, without laying us under any nece&s;&s;ity of looking on it as a new di&s;ea&s;e. Probably it has exi&s;ted more or le&s;s in all ages; for the &s;ame pro|ductive cau&s;es mu&s;t have operated formerly, as they do at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e happens, or at lea&s;t is ob|&s;erved, &s;o &s;eldom in this city, that very few ca&s;es mu&s;t occur to any particular per&s;on, during the cour&s;e of a whole lifetime. To have the power of &s;eeing more, one mu&s;t put him&s;elf in the way of intelligence, e&s;pecially at places &s;ituated on the coa&s;t. By that means, I have had an opportunity of attending more ca&s;es, than otherwi&s;e would have fallen to the &s;hare of any one. The danger of the &s;ymptoms under &s;uch apparent ea&s;e, and the &s;ingularity of its appearances after death, in the fir&s;t examination, excited my curio&s;ity. The &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;es were &s;ufficient to &s;how me its nature, tho' perhaps not to point out a certain cure. That is not always allowed to mortals. To be able, however, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="8" REF="7" MS="y">it from other di&s;ea&s;es; to di&s;cover the nature of it; to point out when it is cureable, and when not; perhaps to lay a foundation for improvement in its mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate; that is the de&s;ign of the following pages.</P>
<P>To be the fir&s;t author in treating a di&s;ea&s;e; to have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from preceding experi|ence, is a &s;ituation a little uncommon in the&s;e modern times. To this cau&s;e, and to the rarity of the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be imputed my not bringing it to that degree of improve|ment, that I could wi&s;h; and that has hap|pened in other di&s;ea&s;es. If this can &s;erve for a foundation to excite others to inquire, to pre&s;erve, and to communicate facts ob|&s;erved by them, my labour will be well be|&s;towed.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e appears to belong peculiarly to children; and the younger they are, af|ter they are weaned, the more liable they &s;eem to it. On the brea&s;t, they appear le&s;s &s;ub|ject to it; or, which is as probable, as they cannot tell their complaints, it is taken for &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e. I never &s;aw, or heard of one, above twelve years of age, affected by
<PB N="9" REF="8">it. After this the body gains a &s;trength capable of re&s;i&s;ting the cau&s;e, or of expelling it when received. About this time, or a lit|tle after, very great changes happen in the human frame.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, likewi&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, to have a local &s;ituation; and to be very &s;el|dom found at any great di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;hore. It appears much le&s;s in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> than in <HI>Leith,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh.</HI> It is often &s;een along the coa&s;t of <HI>Fife;</HI> and is very common, I am told, along the coa&s;t of <HI>Air|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Galloway.</HI> Tho' I never heard of it in the neighbouring coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> yet probably it is to be found there too. The &s;ame cau&s;es, that kept it from being &s;o long attended to here, may &s;till make it neglected there. Very wet and mar&s;hy &s;ituations, &s;ometimes, produce it.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t hi&s;tory of a di&s;ea&s;e, it becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;et down the ca&s;es and the facts, as they really happened. In di&s;ea&s;es, that have already been de&s;cribed, it is &s;ufficient to enumerate the &s;ymptoms, as they generally appeared, by which the diffe|rence betwixt that &s;pecies, and any of the
<PB N="10" REF="9" MS="y">former, may be ob&s;erved. But in a new di&s;ea&s;e, as little ought to be left to the fancy or judgment of the hi&s;torian as po&s;&s;ible; for, from the natural appearance of the &s;ymptoms, all our rea&s;oning and conclu&s;ions mu&s;t take their ri&s;e. As ca&s;es are analogous to the expe|riments of Natural Philo&s;ophy, they ought to be de&s;cribed as circum&s;tantially. <HI>Hippo|rates,</HI> that great hi&s;torian of di&s;ea&s;es, treats his epidemics, as they were new di&s;tempers, in this way.</P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>MARCH 15th. Was called to Mi&s;s****, aged fifteen months, of an inflammatory con|&s;titution, and living within a quarter of a mile of the &s;ea-&s;hore. The day before, &s;he had appeared duller and hotter than u&s;ual. This morning &s;he was attacked with a diffi|culty of breathing. Her pul&s;e was &s;trong, and about 135 in a minute; five ounces of blood was immediately taken from her. Af|ter which, &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;harp &s;tri|dolous voice, which I can re&s;emble to no|thing more nearly than the crowing of a
<PB N="11" REF="10">cock; and which is the true diagno&s;tic &s;ign of this di&s;ea&s;e. She had a quick and high breathing, and unu&s;ual heat in her fore|head, and palms of her hands. Her feet and hands were &s;welled, and had an aedematous appearance. As her pul&s;e was &s;till &s;trong, five ounces of blood was again taken from her, which &s;eemed to ea&s;e her greatly. The &s;teams of warm water and vinegar made her &s;pit up, and did her &s;ervice. Her belly was kept con&s;tantly loo&s;e with <HI>magne&s;ia alba;</HI> and that night a bli&s;ter was applied round her neck. On the third day, &s;he was a lit|tle ea&s;ier; but the voice &s;till remained &s;hrill, the breathing high, and pul&s;e &s;trong. At night four leeches were applied to her throat; and the orifices, con&s;tantly fomented with warm water, continued blooding for four hours. Next morning all the &s;ymptoms went off. In this ca&s;e, the repeated blood|ings, e&s;pecially the local one, with internal and external fomentation, did mo&s;t remark|able &s;ervice. I was not &s;o certain about the effects of the bli&s;ter.</P>

<P>MISS ******, aged eighteen months, healthful, living near a great loch, and a|bout a mile di&s;tant from the &s;ea, was &s;eized, <HI>March</HI> 30th, with the Croup. She had im|mediately lo&s;t five ounces of blood by leeches, and had got a vomit. Next morning, &s;he had taken a &s;econd vomit, after which I fir&s;t &s;aw her. Her voice had the characteri&s;tical &s;hrillne&s;s, only, when &s;he rai&s;ed it, or cough|ed. Her breathing was quick. Pul&s;e about 130. and rather weak. Dry, rough, &s;hort cough. She had no pain in &s;wallowing, but &s;howed unea&s;ine&s;s when &s;he turned about her head. Urine clear, and without &s;ediment. The &s;teams of warm water and vinegar, and a bli&s;ter round the neck, were ordered. In the evening &s;he was better, and her lungs ap|peared &s;omewhat moi&s;ter. That night &s;he re&s;ted pretty well; and on the third day her voice was natural, except when &s;he coughed. She had a running at the no&s;e, and there was a cloud in the urine. The vomit repeated. On the fourth day, the voice was &s;till &s;ome|what
<PB N="13" REF="12">unnatural. The urine now depo&s;ited a light &s;ediment, which la&s;ted for three or four days, during which &s;he gradually reco|vered. She had the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e again &s;ix months after, but in a &s;lighter manner.</P>

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A CHILD two years old, who had had the &s;mall pox &s;ix weeks before, had been &s;eized, Augu&s;t 8th, with the croupy voice. Leeches had been applied, and bli&s;ters be|hind the ears, and to the throat: On the 12th, I &s;aw him, and &s;ound his breath|ing bad, great &s;tuffing, &s;hrill voice, and a &s;welling externally on the &s;uperior part of the <HI>trachea.</HI> Pul&s;e 140. Every thing look|ed ill. Steams, external fomentation, poul|tices, and &s;everal leeches were applied to the throat. 13th, the child greatly relieved, more chearful, and voice more natural. 14th, pul&s;e much better, and the peculiari|ty of voice and the &s;welling almo&s;t gone.</P>
<P>I NEED not relate more ca&s;es of this kind, as &s;uch like commonly occur, and as
<PB N="14" REF="13">they are &s;ufficient to prove its nature in this &s;ituation. The only remark that I &s;hall make is, that the &s;ymptoms of the&s;e three patients, and their cure, &s;how plainly the Croup, in this &s;tate, to be a di&s;ea&s;e of an in|flammatory nature, attacking the organs of voice and re&s;piration, particularly the &s;upe|rior parts of the <HI>trachea,</HI> and that the local inflammation often ends by re&s;olution. This di&s;ea&s;e appears to be confined chiefly to the <HI>trachea,</HI> as the patients have no pain in de|glutition; as they generally complain, when they are of an age to &s;peak, of a dull pain in the upper part of it; as &s;ometimes an external &s;welling is &s;een there; and as the <HI>fauces</HI> are at mo&s;t but a little redder.</P>

<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>SEPTEMBER 29th, 1760, was called to a boy of &s;even years of age, who had been &s;ome days &s;ick. He lived on <HI>Leith</HI> bridge, had
<PB N="15" REF="14">been ill of the chin-cough the preceeding winter, and had recovered of the mea&s;les a|bout &s;ix weeks before this. He had been fre|quently purged, and had been tolerably well, excepting a &s;light cough, till he was &s;eized, four days before I &s;aw him, with fever, heat, thir&s;t, and the &s;hrill croupy voice. When I &s;aw him, his pul&s;e was quick, with a little degree of hardne&s;s, but not &s;trong. He &s;wal|lowed ea&s;ily; but complained of a pain in the <HI>trachea,</HI> when he &s;poke, or when I pre&s;&s;ed it with my fingers. His face had been &s;wel|led. Great drought. Breathing high, but not very quick. He &s;ometimes expecto|rated, and had often frothy <HI>&s;aliva</HI> upon his lips. The urine had a white ouzy &s;ediment. His &s;en&s;es and his head were quite clear and di&s;tinct. He was immediately blooded, and at night had leeches applied to his throat, and a bli&s;ter round it. The next day his pul&s;e was weaker, and beat 175 in a mi|nute. Breathing quicker, and often altered. Di&s;tinct in all his &s;en&s;es. Died that night.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>ON laying open the parts, there was no ap|pearance of any inflammation on the <HI>fauces.</HI> But, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, the whole &s;uperior internal &s;urface of the <HI>trachea</HI> was covered with a white &s;oft thick preternatural coat or membrane, ea&s;ily &s;eparable from it, and generally lying loo&s;e upon it, and purulent matter lodged below, and around it. The &s;ubjacent parts were red; but no great de|gree of inflammation. As we &s;earched downwards, the &s;ame appearances continued thro' the ramifications of the <HI>a&s;pera arteria,</HI> tho' the membrane &s;eemed here &s;ofter, thin|der, and to become of a more purulent na|ture. All the branches of the windpipe and <HI>bronchiae</HI> were filled with purulent matter; and we could ea&s;ily &s;queeze it out, in great plenty, from all the&s;e pipes. The &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs was quite &s;ound, and in a natu|ral &s;tate.</P>
<P>THESE circum&s;tances appeared, at that time, &s;o new and &s;urpri&s;ing to me, that I looked on them as accidental, and not the natural effects of the di&s;ea&s;e. But I was &s;oon convinced of the contrary.</P>

<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>OCTOBER 5th. I WAS called-to the la&s;t boy's &s;i&s;ter, aged five years, who had been ob&s;erved, only the day before, to complain of a dull pain in the throat. She had been im|mediately blooded, and had got a mixture of <HI>&s;pt. minder.</HI> and <HI>theriac,</HI> with a bli&s;ter to the neck. She had been in a con&s;tant &s;weat &s;ince &s;he began to take the mixture. When I &s;aw her &s;he had the dry &s;hrill voice, and difficult breathing, with great motion of the ribs and <HI>&s;capulae.</HI> Her face was a little &s;wel|led and red; deglutition ea&s;y. Her pul&s;e was quick, and of a proper degree of &s;trength. What &s;he expectorated &s;eemed to be of a pu|rulent nature. Her &s;en&s;es were all in the na|tural &s;tate. Leeches were immediately ap|plied to her neck, and afterwards a warm fomentation, and the &s;teams of warm water and vinegar: the&s;e appeared to give her &s;ome ea&s;e. At night &s;he &s;eemed wor&s;e, and could not ly long in one po&s;ture. She was vomited with the <HI>&s;yr. &s;cillit.</HI> and threw up a great deal of gro&s;s ropy defluxion. I tryed her with a
<PB N="18" REF="17">mixture of camphire and nitre. The next day her pul&s;e was 152, and weaker. The <HI>amygdalae</HI> appeared a little &s;welled, and cover|ed with <HI>mucus.</HI> She had a little difficulty of deglutition. Frequent reachings. She called often for drink, but drunk little at a time. Tongue white and furred. Breath|ing rather quicker to-day, and often altered. Eat &s;ome &s;poonfuls of panada and wine. She was ordered an emollient injection, and garlick catapla&s;ms to her feet. In the after|noon, all the &s;ymptoms were wor&s;e. The injection had operated thrice. Breathing difficult and quicker. Great re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and anxiety. Pul&s;e weaker and intermitted. She died in the evening, all her &s;en&s;es being di|stinct, and having eat &s;omewhat ju&s;t before. What &s;he &s;pit up appeared thin; but what came up, with the &s;hort &s;tiffled cough, was always thick and yellow, like matter.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he was opened by Mr <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> Sur|geon, we perceived the glands at the root of the tongue turgid, covered with <HI>mucus,</HI> and their excretories open. The <HI>amygdalae</HI> were larger than u&s;ual; but neither they,
<PB N="19" REF="18">nor the neighbouring parts, were inflamed. All about the <HI>glottis</HI> was covered with a tough vi&s;cid <HI>mucus.</HI> When the <HI>trachea</HI> was open|ed no inflammation appeared; but all its &s;u|perior internal &s;urface, particularly the back part, next the <HI>oe&s;ophagus,</HI> was covered with a &s;oft half-di&s;&s;olved-like-membrahe, detached from the &s;ubjacent parts, lying loo&s;e like the blankets of a bed that has been lain in, and matter like <HI>pus</HI> on each &s;ide of it, and betwixt it and the membrane of the <HI>trachea.</HI> Some of the &s;mall glands about the <HI>glottis</HI> were turgid. The farther down we &s;earched, the more purulent matter we found; but no mem|brane appeared here. When we came to where the <HI>trachea</HI> enters the lungs, by &s;queez|ing them, we could force out thro' it a great deal of whiti&s;h glutinous liquid. The &s;ame matter appeared in all the ramifications of the lungs, and they &s;eemed to be intirely full of it, as we could &s;queeze it our, mixed with a little blood, from the &s;malle&s;t divi&s;ions of that canal. The &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs ap|peared quite &s;ound. The internal coat of
<PB N="20" REF="19">the &s;tomach &s;eemed, likewi&s;e, very &s;oft, and covered with a great quantity of <HI>mucus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>JUANUARY 3d. I was called to a boy of &s;even years of age, at <HI>Mu&s;&s;elburgh,</HI> who had gone about till this morning, but had com|plained for four days of a great difficulty in his breathing, and of a con&s;tant dull pain a|bout the head of the <HI>trachea,</HI> attended with a &s;hrill voice. As his pul&s;e was quick, and his breathing difficult, the Surgeon had that morning taken twelve ounces of blood from him, and given him <HI>Gum. Ammon. Sal. C. C. gr.</HI> iv. When I &s;aw him, at night, his pul&s;e was very frequent and weak, his breathing quick; &s;till a little pain about the head of the <HI>trachea;</HI> no inflammation to be &s;een in the <HI>fauces,</HI> and his urine depo&s;ited an ouzy &s;edi|ment. His voice was feeble, and the &s;hrill|ne&s;s had gone off. As I &s;aw he would &s;oon die, I de&s;ired the Surgeon to open him, and to be particularly attentive to every circum|&s;tance in the whole cour&s;e of the <HI>trachea,</HI> as

<P>A BOOKBINDER'S child, four years old, in this town, was &s;eized with a cough and
<PB N="22" REF="21">quick breathing, Saturday October 5th, 1763. As it appeared of the croupy kind, he was blooded with leeches that day, and bli&s;tered next day. After this he &s;eemed better, and went coughing thro' the hou&s;e that week. Sunday 13th, I fir&s;t &s;aw the child. The voice was rather more hoar&s;e than u&s;ual in the croup; the pul&s;e very quick, and the breathing very laborious, with a little pain in the throat in &s;wallowing. Dry &s;hort cough. I &s;u&s;pected that there was a con&s;iderable mixture of the <HI>angina</HI> with the croup here. Leeches were applied to the neck, with fomentation and &s;teams. 14th, Breathing much better, and all the &s;ymptoms ea&s;ier. 15th, All the &s;ymptoms wor&s;e. Pul&s;e and breathing very quick.

<P>The <HI>trachea,</HI> when opened by Mr <HI>Wood</HI> &s;urgeon, was covered, for half an inch from the <HI>glottis</HI> downwards, with a firm white thick membrane, from which, for an inch further down, was a &s;oft yellowi&s;h purulent-like matter, not yet hardened. All the mem|branes of the <HI>trachea</HI> were entire under the&s;e, but much inflamed and red. In &s;ome parts

<HEAD>CASE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>OCTOBER 20th, 1763. A girl, aged four years, coughed a little, was out the day fol|lowing, and, at night, the cough increa&s;ed with hoar&s;ene&s;s. On the 22d, Mr <HI>Wood,</HI> the family-&s;urgeon, by accident, &s;aw her play|ing, and ob&s;erving her breathing laborious, and her pul&s;e quick, tho' &s;he was otherwi&s;e well, he blooded her. 23d, She was wor&s;e, and had a bli&s;ter applied to her throat and back, and got an injection. 24th, I &s;aw her fir&s;t; her breathing quick, and hoar&s;e; pul&s;e 180; urine with an ouzy &s;ediment; and was told, that &s;he had coughed up, what &s;eemed to the family, pure matter. By her breathing, more of the &s;ame kind &s;till &s;eemed to be left be|hind. She eat and drank without any pain. To expel the matter, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;he got a vomit of &s;quills; but nothing came away. 25th, She was much in the &s;ame way; and I ob|&s;erved &s;ome matter mixed with the <HI>&s;aliva,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="23">that &s;he had coughed up. Breathing ex|ceeding quick, and laborious. Ordered the &s;teams of warm vinegar to be drawn into the lungs, on purpo&s;e to produce a fit of cough|ing; but it had no &s;uch effect, and &s;he died in the evening.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>trachea</HI> was opened, by Mr <HI>Wood,</HI> the whole internal &s;urface was cover|ed with a membrane for three inches down|wards from the <HI>glottis.</HI> This membrane was compleat all around, did not adhere to the <HI>trachea,</HI> and came off in the &s;hape of a hol|low tube. The natural coats of the <HI>trachea</HI> &s;eemed entire, and not ulcered. The &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs was quite &s;ound; but the ve&s;icles of the left lobe were filled with yellow thick <HI>pus,</HI> which &s;unk in water. The new formed membrane had &s;ome degree of tenacity; and, when &s;teeped in milk-warm water for two days, did not di&s;&s;olve, but pre&s;erved &s;ome degree of cohe&s;ion. Mo fibres could be ob&s;erved in it.</P>

<HEAD>CASE IX.</HEAD>
<P>MR <HI>Wardrobe</HI> Surgeon related to me the the following ca&s;e. A boy, eight years of age, and healthful, had been ill two days. His breathing was difficult; his voice was croupy; he was feveri&s;h, and had all the o|ther &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. He was blood|ed, bli&s;tered, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all to no purpo&s;e; and died the fourth day.</P>
<P>THE whole <HI>trachea,</HI> externally, appeared &s;welled, and rather oedematous than inflam|matory. When he opened it, the whole in|&s;ide was covered with a &s;oft, thick, pale-co|loured membrane, which ea&s;ily &s;eparated from the parts below; tho&s;e had a &s;light degree of inflammation. When he pur&s;ued the ra|mifications of the <HI>trachea</HI> thro' the lungs, there was found, there, a con&s;iderable quantity of real <HI>pus,</HI> which &s;eemed to fill all tho&s;e pipes.

<PB N="26" REF="25">this; and as Mr <HI>Wardrobe</HI> had no occa&s;ion of ever &s;eeing it again, he had concluded, as I had done before, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, that it was an anomalous ca&s;e. It now ap|pears to be the common cour&s;e of nature, in that di&s;ea&s;e, when mortal.</P>

<HEAD>CASE X.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ca&s;e, in confirmation of the preceeding, was communicated to me by Mr <HI>Balfour</HI> Surgeon, and which I &s;hall de|liver in his own words. <HI>November</HI> 1&s;t 1763, I was de&s;ired to vi&s;it a child, between two and three years old, living at the <HI>Canonmills.</HI> His face was flu&s;hed; his breathing laborious; his cough of the hard croupy kind; his pul&s;e was frequent; his tongue clean; with little drought, and no pain. I was informed by the parents, that the child had been very healthful; but for eight days pa&s;t had been troubled with a cough, which did not put on the pre&s;ent appearance till the night be|fore I was called; and that the child had, till that time, gone about, and eat his meat heartily. They had then applied leeches to
<PB N="27" REF="26">his neck, which bled a great deal, and had with difficulty been &s;topt. I immedi|ately took away, from the jugular vein, two cupfulls of blood more, which was &s;izy; and being informed, that he &s;ometimes reached, I ordered a vomit of <HI>tinct. ipecacuanh.</HI> with an addition of <HI>acet. &s;cillit.</HI> which was given about an hour after he was blooded, and brought up a great deal of tenacious <HI>mucus.</HI> That night, he got a bli&s;ter to his back, and the &s;aline mixture every two hours. <HI>Nov.</HI> 2d, His Pul&s;e was as frequent, but not &s;o firm. All the other &s;ymptoms rather wor&s;e. He was ordered a decoction of the bark; the oily &s;aline mixture, to be taken internally; and the camphorated volatile oil, to be ap|plied externally. The child took two or three do&s;es of the decoction and mixture; but towards the evening, the &s;ymptoms grow|ing wor&s;e, the medicines were di&s;continued. The child died next morning.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>trachea</HI> was laid open, I thought that a &s;uppuration had happened; but, upon nearer in&s;pection, found, that it was only the <HI>mucus</HI> which had acquired a pu+rulent
<PB N="28" REF="27">colour; and that it was formed into a membranous cru&s;t, which every where lined the internal membrane of the <HI>trachea,</HI> from the <HI>larynx,</HI> to its entrance into the <HI>thorax.</HI> This preternatural membrane appeared thick|e&s;t about the middle of the <HI>trachea;</HI> and, there, &s;eemed almo&s;t to fill up the pa&s;&s;age. It was &s;o firm, that a con&s;iderable portion &s;eparate|ed, at once, leaving the natural membrane of the <HI>trachea</HI> bare and &s;ound, and with the appearance of a &s;light inflammation. I put a con&s;iderable portion of the preternatural membrane into water; and, after that, it &s;till retained a degree of tenacity, but had too little firmne&s;s to be pre&s;erved.</P>

<P>MR <HI>Wood</HI> Surgeon gave me the following. A child, about &s;ixteen months old, was &s;eiz|ed with the Croup, and died the &s;eventh day.

<HEAD>CASE XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ca&s;e, which was communi|cated to me by&mdash;, I think worth relating; as it &s;hows the di&s;ea&s;e in a different &s;itu|ation from all the preceeding; indeed, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, as I never had an opportunity to &s;ee, and mu&s;t appear very &s;eldom in, for it is the only one of its kind that I have heard of.</P>
<P>MISS ******, about nine years old, was &s;eized with a &s;light cough, on the 25th of
<PB N="30" REF="29"><HI>October,</HI> owing to rainy weather, and wet feet. On the 26th, when I &s;aw her fir&s;t, the &s;carcely had any heat, thir&s;t, or &s;ickne&s;s, and no pain of any kind, except when &s;he cough|ed, or was fretted, which bringing on a quick in&s;piration, &s;he then felt &s;ome &s;light pain in the windpipe, a little below the <HI>rima glottidis.</HI> Her voice was &s;hrill, like that of a young cock. She was blooded; got a gentle vomit; emolient catapla&s;ms to her feet; and a bli&s;ter to her back. 27th, Symptoms no better. No difficulty of deglutition, and no redne&s;s to be &s;een in the throat. She never expec|torated any thing like <HI>pus</HI> or phlegm, during the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Steams of warm water were tried. 28th, Her cough was ince&s;&s;ant for &s;ome hours, during which, &s;he coughed up a piece of a membrane. This I believed to be a part of what lines the <HI>trachea,</HI> as it had a mortified appear|ance, and was like black &s;hagg &s;ilk. She died &s;oon after this.</P>
<P>UPON opening the body, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eem|ed &s;eated, &s;olely, in the head of the <HI>trachea,</HI> as its membrane appeared to me mortified
<PB N="31" REF="30">two inches downwards. Below that, the <HI>trachea,</HI> and its branches, &s;eemed quite &s;ound.</P>
<P>IT was very natural for one, who had never any opportunity of &s;eeing this di&s;ea&s;e in its natural &s;ituation, to think, that a mor|tification had &s;eized on the coats of the <HI>tra|chea.</HI> But to one who has been accu&s;tom|ed to in&s;pect bodies, in this di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t appear probable, that it was only the preter|natural and morbid membrane become black, which gave the <HI>trachea</HI> the appearance of be|ing mortified. No wonder that the coats of the <HI>trachea</HI> were thought to be in a gangre|nous &s;tate, when I imagined they had &s;uppu|rated in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, that I met with. The coughing up a piece of the membrane, &s;hows that it was this loo&s;ely adhering one, and none of the natural ones, which are &s;o firm|ly attached; and which, having no fle&s;hy parts below, could not have been &s;o ea&s;ily &s;e|parated. This, then, appears to differ in no other point from the others, but only that here the morbid membrane had dryed
<PB N="32" REF="31">and turned black; whereas, in all the former, it was moi&s;t and white.</P>
<P>THESE are all the ca&s;es, that I have kept an account of, or received from others. Tho' few, they are leading ones, and &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h many material facts and circum&s;tan|ces, that have hitherto been unknown, with regard to this di&s;ea&s;e. We will now draw, from them, &s;ome conclu&s;ions; which, as we have proceeded &s;o cautiou&s;ly, will be the more certain. If we add any rea&s;oning, to &s;et the&s;e conclu&s;ions in a clearer light, we &s;hall keep as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to &s;ettled experi|ment; and &s;hall give it only as probable con|jecture, finding fault with no per&s;on who may rea&s;on differently.</P>
<P>COROLLARY I. It &s;eems ea&s;y, in general, to di&s;tingui&s;h the Croup from all other di&s;ea&s;es hitherto de&s;cribed. A peculiar &s;harp &s;hrill voice, not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed; a remark|able freedom from all complaints, when in imminent danger, &s;o that they will eat a mi|nute before they expire; a quick laborious breathing; a frequent pul&s;e, &s;ometimes &s;trong at fir&s;t, but always &s;oft and weak to|wards
<PB N="33" REF="32">the end; &s;carce any difficulty of de|glutition, or remarkable inflammation in the <HI>fauces;</HI> a dull pain, often, and &s;ometimes an external &s;welling in the upper part of the <HI>trachea;</HI> &s;en&s;es quite di&s;tinct to the la&s;t; and all the &s;ymptoms mo&s;t rapid in their progre&s;s, characteri&s;e &s;ufficiently this di&s;ea&s;e. I have not mentioned a cough, as that &s;ymptom is &s;ometimes ab&s;ent; and when it attends the Croup, it is not of the common kind, but more &s;hort and &s;tiffled, and le&s;s convul&s;ive, with little or no expectoration.</P>
<P>THE other &s;ymptoms, that often attend it, &s;uch as a red &s;welled face, oedematous feet, drought, urine &s;ometimes with, and, at other times, without a &s;ediment, reachings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not &s;o con&s;tant as the former; and therefore, are not &s;o characteri&s;tical.</P>
<P>THOSE not conver&s;ant in this di&s;ea&s;e, of|ten mi&s;take peripneumoniacal complaints, and &s;evere colds, for it; and, as they frequent|ly cure the&s;e, they are apt to look on it as not &s;o dangerous. But we have &s;een, that the lungs are totally free from any inflam|mation, and are not the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e.
<PB N="34" REF="33" MS="y">The <HI>Catarrhus &s;uffocativus</HI> of <HI>Etmuller</HI> &s;eems, likewi&s;e, to have been a peripneumony. And, as he de&s;cribes no peculiarity in the voice; as the &s;ymptoms &s;eem to have been, apparently, &s;everer; and as it returned, at &s;tated and re|gular periods, we mu&s;t con&s;ider them as dif|ferent di&s;ea&s;es, tho' &s;imilar in many points.</P>
<P>As this di&s;ea&s;e has different vulgar names, for I am told, that on the we&s;t coa&s;t, they call it the <HI>Chock,</HI> or <HI>Stuffing,</HI> a technical one becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. A name is be&s;t given from the apparent &s;ymptoms, which are al|ways con&s;picuous, while the cau&s;e is general|ly hidden, and often doubtful. The lead|ing &s;ymptoms here, are, the &s;hrill voice, and difficult breathing. It, therefore, may pro|perly be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">led <HI>Suffocatio &s;tridula.</HI></P>
<P>COROL. II. As it appears peculiar to a certain age, and local, in a great mea&s;ure, as to its &s;ituation, &s;o it &s;eems to attend certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year. All the preceeding ca&s;es &s;howed them&s;elves during the cour&s;e of the winter, from the month of <HI>October</HI> to the month of <HI>March,</HI> except one in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which was probably owing to the antecedent
<PB N="35" REF="34" MS="y">&s;mall-pox; for long catarrhs from the &s;mall pox, mea&s;les, or chin-cough, are &s;trong pre|di&s;ponent cau&s;es to this di&s;ea&s;e. The moi&s;t and cold weather in winter, &s;eems to have great power in producing this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>COROL. III. Very different have been the opinions, with regard to the &s;eat of the <HI>Suf|focatio &s;tridula.</HI> Some placing it in the <HI>glot|tis</HI> and its mu&s;cles; &s;ome in the coats of the <HI>trachea;</HI> while others have fixt its &s;eat in the lungs them&s;elves. None of all the&s;e opini|ons appear to be true. The <HI>glottis</HI> is never found contracted or inflamed; the lungs are quite &s;ound; and the coats of the <HI>tracked</HI> &s;eem to &s;uffer only by &s;econd hand.</P>
<P>THE &s;eat of this di&s;temper appears to be the cavity of the wind-pipe. The place fir&s;t, and mo&s;t particularly, affected, is the upper part of the <HI>trachea,</HI> about an inch below the <HI>glottis;</HI> for in that part they complain of a dull pain; the external &s;welling has been ob|&s;erved there; and the morbid membrane we have found &s;tretching from that place down|wards. The back part of the <HI>trachea,</HI> where there are no cartilages, &s;eems, from the in|&s;pection

<PB N="36" REF="37">&s;pection of tho&s;e that die of this di&s;ea&s;e, to be its fir&s;t and principal &s;eat, as this morbid membrane is often found there, when it is in no other part.</P>
<P>No wonder that the morbid appearances are chiefly found there; for, there, are lodg|ed the greate&s;t number of glands, de&s;igned for the &s;ecretion of <HI>mucus.</HI> This fluid is &s;e|parated from glandular bodies, depo&s;ited be|twixt the different membranes, which are per|forated by an infinite number of almo&s;t im|perceptible &s;mall holes, that give a pa&s;&s;age to the excretory ducts of the&s;e glands. The large&s;t of the&s;e lye on the outer, and po&s;te|rior &s;urface of that membrane, which &s;erves, on the back part, to make up the deficiency of the cartilages, as they are not compleat circles.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome of the former ca&s;es, the whole glands, at the root of the tongue, and the <HI>amygdalae</HI> were turgid, and the parts covered with <HI>mucus.</HI> In the mucous glands, in general, this di&s;temper ought to be con&s;idered, as ori|ginally &s;eated; but, from particular cau&s;es, more directed to tho&s;e of the <HI>trachea;</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="38">where, from the nature of the part, it be|comes vi&s;ible in a different &s;hape.</P>
<P>COROL. IV. Various have been the the|oretical opinions of people, who never had the opportunity, or gave them&s;elves the trouble, to &s;earch into the real cau&s;e of this di&s;temper. Some have attributed it to &s;pa&s;ms of the mu&s;cles, that contract the <HI>glottis.</HI> That it was not occa&s;ioned by &s;pa&s;ms of the mu&s;cles, that contract the <HI>larynx,</HI> might have appeared from the &s;ymptoms them|&s;elves. Had this been of the cla&s;s of &s;pa&s;|modic nervous di&s;ea&s;es, it would have come in paroxy&s;ms, with remi&s;&s;ion and exacerba|tion; the urine would always have been pale; convul&s;ions would have come on before death; and anti&s;pa&s;modics, in&s;tead of evacuants, would have been the remedies.</P>
<P>HAD the&s;e mu&s;cles, or any of the coats of the <HI>trachea,</HI> been inflamed or mortified, as others have thought, the pain would have been greater than it is, before the mortifica|tion; and the pul&s;e would have been &s;trong|er, than it generally is, as the parts are membranous.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="39">
<P>IF, according to the opinion of many, the lungs had been inflamed and &s;uppurated; the cough would have been more ince&s;&s;ant and violent; the pul&s;e full and &s;oft; with a &s;en|&s;ation of weight in the brea&s;t, &s;izy blood, dry tongue, and delirium.</P>
<P>BUT all the&s;e fanciful erroneous opinions fall to the ground, when we once in&s;pect the morbid body. From that true &s;ource of knowledge, we learn, that the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e is a preternatural white, tough, thick membranous cru&s;t, covering, often for many inches, the in&s;ide of the <HI>trachea.</HI> This mem|brane is of &s;o tenacious a con&s;i&s;tence, that it can remain &s;oaking in warm water, for ma|ny days, without di&s;&s;olving. It is not at|tached to the parts below, but is ea&s;ily &s;e|parable from them, as there is always mat|ter behind it. When it ends, the <HI>trachea</HI> is covered with good <HI>pus,</HI> or purulent <HI>mucus;</HI> as are, generally, the ramifications of the <HI>bronchiae</HI> and ve&s;icles, which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, were quite filled with it. To account how this matter, as there is no ulceration; and how this membrane are formed, we mu&s;t trace things from their &s;ource.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
<P>THE blood con&s;i&s;ts of three principal parts, the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum, &s;erum,</HI> and <HI>lymph;</HI> the la&s;t of which is a diaphanous liquor, full of ge|latinous and nutritious particles. This liquor very &s;imilar to the white of an egg, is coagulable by heat, alkohol, acids, and by every method which attracts or evaporates the watery particles. This coagulable part, probably, is the nutritious part of our blood.</P>
<P>THIS gelatinous lymph abounds more in young animals, than in tho&s;e come to matu|rity. <HI>Geoffroy le Cadet,</HI> in the <HI>Mem. Acad. des Sciences,</HI> for the year 1730, by many ex|periments &s;hows us this fact; and makes it appear, that there is twice as much nutritive jelly in veal, as in beef. The final rea&s;on for this is &s;elf-evident; for young creatures, on account of their growing, require a greater &s;upply of nouri&s;hment. Children mu&s;t, there|fore, abound more with it than men.</P>
<P>The <HI>mucus</HI> &s;eparated from glands, in diffe|rent parts of the body, <HI>viz.</HI> no&s;e, <HI>fauces, oe&s;o|phagus,</HI> &s;tomach, guts, <HI>trachea,</HI> and <HI>bronchiae,</HI> appears to be very analogous to this lymph.
<PB N="40" REF="41">The former differs from the latter, only, in its greater &s;pi&s;&s;itude; and this alteration is brought about after its &s;ecretion, the more watery parts being volatilized and di&s;&s;ipated, while the more heavy and vi&s;cous remain be|hind. This <HI>mucus</HI> is extremely di&s;po&s;ed to in&s;pi&s;&s;ation, as appears from experiments. Even the admi&s;&s;ion of cold air into the <HI>tra|chea</HI> thickens this <HI>mucus,</HI> often, to &s;uch a de|gree, that it &s;tagnates in the glands, and all &s;ecretion is entirely &s;topt.</P>
<P>IN children, as well as in old people, this &s;ecretion is plentiful, owing to the great quantity of it they contain, and to the laxity of their ve&s;&s;els. This evacuation is particu|larly increa&s;ed during the cold and moi&s;t weather of winter, when the per&s;piration is dimini&s;hed, and the glandular &s;ecretions in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS evacuation is promoted by all &s;ti|mulants, operating on the <HI>trachea</HI> and lungs, as we ob&s;erve from the effects of &s;nuff, and the &s;moak of tobacco. The maritime air &s;upplies a <HI>&s;timulus,</HI> calculated to increa&s;e the &s;ecretion from the <HI>mucus</HI> glands of the <HI>trachea</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="42">and lungs. Along with the moi&s;ture, &s;weep|ed from the &s;ea by the winds, is carried likewi&s;e, a great quantity of &s;ea-&s;alt; as every thing, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, ta&s;tes &s;alt. This in&s;pired into the lungs, &s;timu|lates the orifices of the tracheal glands, and increa&s;es the mucous &s;ecretion. This effect will happen more particularly in children, as their nerves are more irritable, than tho&s;e of people advanced in years. Hence we find, that, in moi&s;t winter weather, particularly a|long the &s;ea-&s;hore&punc; children &s;hould have an unu&s;ual &s;ecretion of <HI>mucus,</HI> from the glands of the wind-pipe. Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as the &s;mall|pox, mea&s;les, chin-cough, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and other na|tural cau&s;es, have the &s;ame effect in increa&s;ing this di&s;charge. When the&s;e are combined, there exi&s;ts the greate&s;t predi&s;po&s;ition to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN there happens a very great &s;ecre|tion of this coagulate fluid from the glands of the <HI>trachea</HI> in children, they are either not &s;ufficiently attentive, or often too young, to &s;pit it up. The thinner parts are carried off during expiration, while the remainder is
<PB N="42" REF="43">thickened and compre&s;&s;ed, by the ob&s;truction, that the narrowne&s;s of the <HI>glottis</HI> mu&s;t make to the exit of the air from a larger canal. Every circum&s;tance encourages its concre|tion into a &s;olid firm membrane, while the more internal parts of the <HI>mucus,</HI> continuing &s;till fluid, and the continual &s;ecretion of more, keep it &s;eparated from the parts be|low.</P>
<P>BUT how happens it that we find pure matter, which &s;inks in water, behind the membrane, and in the different ramifications of the <HI>trachea,</HI> when there is no ulceration? Matter does not seem to be formed, as was generally thought, by the ve&s;&s;els of the ulcer; but to exi&s;t in the blood, particularly in the &s;erous and lymphatic liquors, nearly in the fame &s;tate; and to be, probably, the true nu|trititious, nay, perhaps, the coagulable part of our fluids. Dr <HI>Pringle,</HI> in his ingenious, u&s;eful, and accurate experiments, upon &s;ep|tic and anti&s;eptic &s;ub&s;tances, found, that the <HI>&s;erum,</HI> when &s;tagnating, and expo&s;ed to heat, let fall a white &s;ubstance like <HI>pus;</HI> and, from thence, ju&s;tly, concludes, that the <HI>pus</HI> of ulcers is formed, in the &s;ame way, by the evapora|tion
<PB N="43" REF="44" MS="y">of the more watery particles, and the &s;ub&s;iding and in&s;pi&s;&s;ation of this part. This fluid &s;hows a great tendency to become &s;olid, by re&s;toring quickly all lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THERE cannot be a fitter &s;ituation, for the formation of <HI>pus</HI> from the mucous &s;ecre|tion, than the <HI>trachea</HI> and lungs. There the &s;ame &s;ecretion, evaporation, &s;tagnation, and heat exi&s;ts, as in an ulcer; and, therefore, the &s;ame con&s;equence &s;hould, and does, hap|pen. We often &s;ee real <HI>pus</HI> &s;pit up in the end of a cold. Perhaps this change from <HI>mucus</HI> to <HI>pus,</HI> happens before the membrane is formed, as <HI>pus</HI> &s;hows &s;uch a tendency to a&s;&s;ume a &s;olid form, and is de&s;igned by Na|ture to repair all deficiencies in the &s;olids.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e now appears of a very &s;ingu|lar nature, and unlike any other that we know. <HI>Du Haen</HI> has, indeed, lately told us, that he has &s;ometimes found, in di&s;&s;ection, the <HI>vi&s;cera</HI> covered, externally, with a white tough cru&s;t. I wi&s;h he had given us the hi&s;tory of &s;ome of the&s;e patients. He ima|gines, that it was formed from the inflam|matory cru&s;t in the blood; but, here, these never is found any.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="45">
<P>I HAVE lately met with a de&s;cription in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions abridged, Vol. 3d, page 68th, of a membrane formed in the in&s;ide of the <HI>trachea.</HI>" <Q REND="margDblQuotes">"A boy five years old, died of a consumption. A year be|fore his death, he was troubled with a dry cough, which continued ever after, &s;pitting, now and then, a little quantity of blood. Ten or twelve days before he died, his nurse took notice of &s;ome thick &s;kins he &s;pit up. His Phy&s;cian, having exami|ned one of them, &s;ound, it had the &s;hape and con&s;i&s;tence of a ve&s;&s;el, which made him think it might perhaps be &s;ome ve&s;|&s;el of the lungs. The child being dead, I opened the body. In the left &s;ide of the lungs, I found a little purulent <HI>&s;anies.</HI> The in&s;ide of the <HI>trachea</HI> was incru&s;tated with a &s;limy membrane, which I took off from the <HI>trachea,</HI> and the branches in the lungs, in&s;omuch that that <HI>pellicula</HI> made a perfect ve&s;&s;el, from the <HI>larynx</HI> to the ve|ry extremities of the <HI>bronchiae,</HI> from which it came off very ea&s;ily, without breaking ei|ther the trunk, or the branches. It adhered
<PB N="45" REF="46">to the inward coat of the <HI>trachea,</HI> only by &s;ome &s;mall filaments, which were &s;o ten|der, that they broke off easily; and made me think, the production of that extraor|dinary ve&s;&s;el was nothing but the mucila|ginous humour, continually di&s;charged by the glands of the <HI>trachea,</HI> grown more clammy by the di&s;temper, and &s;o dry that it could not be &s;pit out; this incru&s;ting the in&s;ide of the <HI>trachea</HI> and <HI>bronchiae,</HI> and growing thicker, was at la&s;t &s;haven off by the violent fit of coughing the child was &s;ometimes taken with, and then was re|newed again by the &s;ucceeding <HI>mucus.</HI> This new ve&s;&s;el would not di&s;&s;olve in hot water. The ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, that is the <HI>tra|chea</HI> and <HI>bronchiae,</HI> the pulmonary arteries and veins, were as whole as could be."</Q></P>
<P>IT appears, by the di&s;&s;ection, that there was no impo&s;thume formed in the lungs; and that the child died from this preternatural membrane. Perhaps, many of the <HI>polypus</HI>'s, thrown up from the bronchial ve&s;&s;els of grown up people, might have the &s;ame origin.
<PB N="46" REF="47">The&s;e ca&s;es &s;how, how apt the <HI>mucus</HI> is to ac|quire a &s;olid form.</P>
<P>WE have an account, in the Philo&s;ophi|cal Tran&s;actions abridged, vol. 2d, of a di&s;|ea&s;e in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> called the <HI>morbus &s;trangula|torius,</HI> which, from the pu&s;tles, <HI>petechiae;</HI> and putrid di&s;po&s;ition of the fluids, appears more nearly allied to the malignant &s;ore throat, altho' it &s;ometimes attacked the <HI>a&s;pera arte|ria.</HI> A case is, there, related, where a hol|low membranous coat, of the &s;hape of the <HI>trachea</HI> and its branches, was coughed up, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the natural membrane of the&s;e parts. Another &s;imilar to the former came up afterwards. The patient lived about a day after this.</P>
<P>COROL. V. There appears, from the pre|ceeding facts, two very different &s;ituations of the <HI>Suffocatio &s;tridula;</HI> the former more in|flammatory, and le&s;s dangerous; the latter le&s;s inflammatory, and highly dangerous. In the former, the pul&s;e is generally &s;trong; the face red; drought great; and they agree with evacuations: In the latter, the pul&s;e is very quick, and &s;oft; great weakne&s;s; tongue
<PB N="47" REF="48">moi&s;t; le&s;s drought; great anxiety; and evacuations ha&s;ten death. The former may be called the inflammatory; and the latter, the purulent &s;tate.</P>
<P>THESE are two very different &s;tages of the di&s;temper, and mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the practitioner, that he may know how to direct his applications; or, at lea&s;t, how to form a ju&s;t <HI>progno&s;is;</HI> as he is, generally, not called till the patient is in the latter &s;tage. If this di&s;ea&s;e comes on with an old habitual cough, or by &s;low de|grees, the inflammatory &s;tage will &s;carcely be perceivable.</P>
<P>IF the pul&s;e is very &s;oft and feeble, e&s;peci|ally after being &s;trong; or any purulent mat|ter comes up with &s;pitting, vomiting, or coughing, which happened in &s;ome of the former ca&s;es, we have a proof that the pu|rulent &s;tate is, already, formed. Experi|ence has taught me another mark, by which I can di&s;tingui&s;h these different &s;tates. I have ob&s;erved, that the urine, which, du|ring the inflammatory &s;tate, is thin, had always, after the purulent &s;tate came on, a
<PB N="48" REF="49">light ouzy purulent &s;ediment, &s;uch as people have from matter collected any where, that has no vent outwards.</P>
<P>NO wonder, that the matter is &s;peedily ab&s;orbed, in this &s;ituation, as it is contained in the <HI>bronchiae</HI> and ve&s;icles, and of cour&s;e im|bibed by the whole internal &s;urface of the lungs and <HI>trachea;</HI> a &s;urface infinitely great|er than any impo&s;thume can have. Hence the blood will be &s;uddenly filled with it; and the urine have that white purulent &s;ediment, which ari&s;es from ab&s;orption of matter.</P>
<P>IN the latter &s;tage, we find the membrane compleatly formed. Is it &s;o in the former? I &s;u&s;pect that it has not yet got a firm con|&s;i&s;tency; otherwi&s;e evacuations would not have &s;o &s;udden and &s;alutary an effect, as they produce in this &s;tage. Perhaps, the turgid and inflamed glands are but yet expelling the thick <HI>mucus,</HI> which is circulating thro' the ve&s;&s;els in too great a quantity, and in too in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated a &s;tate. This is &s;trongly confirmed by the great quantity of <HI>mucus,</HI> &s;ound in the &s;tomach, and the &s;welling of the mucous glands at the root of the tongue. Even af|ter
<PB N="49" REF="50">death we perceive &s;ome degree of inflam|mation in the coais of the <HI>trachea,</HI> which probably has been greater at the beginning, when the flux of humour commeneed, and the irritation was &s;tronger.</P>
<P>COROL. VI. It seems to be no very dif|ficult matter to account, from the cau&s;e, for all the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e. A &s;trait|ening of the <HI>trachea,</HI> and dryne&s;s of the parts, will mechanically alter the voice, and make it more &s;hrill; for we find in all wind in&s;tru|ments, the notes are acute in proportion to the smallne&s;s of the bore. Mr <HI>Balfour</HI> &s;ur|geon told me, that he attended a child in a disease, which, from the &s;imilarity of voice, appeared to him the Croup. The child died. When opened, a piece of &s;hell, which the child had &s;ucked in with it's breath, was ly|ing acro&s;s the <HI>trachea,</HI> about an inch below the <HI>glottis,</HI> and the membrane was infla|med and dry. Here was an artificial Croup rai&s;ed, from which we may evidently per|ceive how the voice is altered in the natural di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="51">
<P>WHEN there appears to be a great quan|tity of <HI>mucus</HI> circulating in the ve&s;&s;els; when there is, often, &s;o much <HI>mucus</HI> or <HI>pus</HI> in all the pipes of the lungs; when there is a preterna|tural membrane formed in the <HI>trachea;</HI> no wonder that Nature excites a fever, her ge|neral and con&s;tant re&s;ource, when &s;he is vio|lently attacked and in danger.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the acutene&s;s of the fever; con&s;idering the ob&s;truction in the <HI>trachea, bronchiae,</HI> and ve&s;icles; with what difficulty the air mu&s;t gain admi&s;&s;ion to di&s;tend them; and what hindrance that mu&s;t give the blood circulating through the lungs; a laborious breathing mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, attend the other &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>AS the blood pa&s;&s;es with &s;ome difficulty thro' the lungs, an unu&s;ual weakne&s;s mu&s;t certainly come on, the face become &s;well|ed, and the extremities appear oedematous.</P>
<P>TO account for that total want of pain, or &s;o &s;light a one that they don't attend to it, unle&s;s when a&s;ked, is a matter of &s;ome difficulty. That the membrane of the wind|pipe, in general &s;o very irritable from every
<PB N="51" REF="52">&s;light cau&s;e, &s;hould calmly bear the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a quantity of matter, and of &s;o thick a membrane, is not the lea&s;t &s;urprizing cir|cum&s;tance of this uncommon di&s;temper. The <HI>mucus</HI> being a humour natural to the&s;e parts; its &s;low and gradual collection and in&s;pi&s;&s;a|tion; fre&s;h <HI>mucus</HI> con&s;tantly &s;eparated, which hinder the membrane from hurting the <HI>tra|chea,</HI> unle&s;s in motions of the neck; the&s;e rea&s;ons may account, in part, for the dimi|nution of that natural irritability, which re|&s;ides in the&s;e places. But they do not &s;atisfy me altogether. We cannot expect to have all our doubts removed.</P>
<P>COROL. VII. This di&s;ea&s;e appears, in ge|neral, to be a very dangerous one, and the more &s;o, as it is &s;ilent in its progre&s;s, and gives no vi&s;ible alarm, till death is near at hand. The fir&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;temper, of|ten, pa&s;&s;es unob&s;erved; and, before we &s;ee it, is beyond all remedy. As it happens, fre|quently, to young children, who are unable to &s;peak or de&s;cribe their feelings, we have double rea&s;on to be afraid.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="53">
<P>IF we be not called till the third or fourth day; if the breathing appears much affected, the pul&s;e quick and weak, the face red, great anx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ety, and frequent to&s;&s;ing, the dan|ger is great and pre&s;&s;ing. But if we &s;ee the patient the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the attack; if the breathing is not very bad; the pul&s;e, though frequent, &s;trong, and firm; and more e&s;pecially, if the voice is only altered, in its &s;tronger exertions of crying or cough|ing, but more natural in its common &s;tate, we may entertain hopes of a recovery. The fir&s;t &s;ign commonly of &s;afety, is the cough becoming &s;tronger and le&s;s dry, with that peculiar &s;ound which attends moi&s;tened lungs; for this &s;hows that the membrane is not formed, or is already di&s;&s;olved, and that the inflammatory &s;tate is abated.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e &s;eems very de&s;perate, when the membrane is once formed, and the lungs filled with matter. In the latter ca&s;e, the patient is &s;oon &s;uffocated, as effectually, tho' more &s;lowly, as if he was immer&s;ed over the head in it.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="54">
<P>IT appears, from the preceeding ca&s;es, that the membrane, alone, is &s;ufficient to kill, as there was but little matter found in the lungs of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>DESPERATE as the ca&s;e is, the patient's recovery is, perhaps, not altogether impo&s;|&s;ible. Nature, by the means of a critical cough, may eject the membrane and matter; though, indeed, the &s;en&s;ation of the&s;e parts, by which it mu&s;t effectuate this, &s;eems al|mo&s;t altogether de&s;troyed. If that happen|ed, the patient would recover, as the lungs are quite &s;ound.</P>
<P>IN one of the former ca&s;es, part of the membrane was thrown up, but the patient died. I was told by Mr <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> &s;urgeon, that a patient of his e&s;caped, after throw|ing up a great quantity of matter, and coughing up large pieces of a membrane.</P>
<P>THE following curious ca&s;e was commu|nicated to me, lately, by Mr <HI>Rae</HI> &s;urgeon. A boy betwixt five and &s;ix years of age, was &s;eized, Augu&s;t 5th, 1764, with a &s;light cold and hoar&s;ene&s;s. On the 8th, had a dif|ficulty of breathing, the &s;hrill voice, and a
<PB N="54" REF="55" MS="y">little fever. As the boy was in a natural &s;weat, he ordered a mixture with <HI>Spt. Minder.</HI> 9th, Pul&s;e quicker, and no expectoration. Was blooded, got an injection, and had a bli&s;ter applied to his throat. 11th, This morning he was told, that, after a &s;evere fit of cough|ing, a membrane-like &s;ub&s;tance, about two inches long, pretty tough, and re&s;embling a piece of thin white leather, had been thrown out. In the evening, &s;ome <HI>pus</HI> was ob&s;er|vable in the phlegm expectorated up, and ea|&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from it. The boy did not recover his voice for three months.</P>
<P>ART, though not in the way of internal medicine, may attempt effectuating the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>COROL. VIII. We have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee, in the preceeding ca&s;es, great variety of different applications, and their good or bad &s;ucce&s;s. Let us deduce &s;ome general rules with regard to practice. In the inflam|matory &s;tate, bleeding appears to have been attended with immediate good effects, and to be a powerful remedy in this &s;ituation. This ought to be done expeditiou&s;ly and plentifully, while the pul&s;e will allow it. It
<PB N="55" REF="56" MS="y">is be&s;t to take blood at fir&s;t, with the lan|cet, &s;o that a &s;ufficient quantity may &s;oon b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> drawn off; and, afterwards, by leeches, appli|ed to the upper and fore part of the throat. Their orifices, when kept open by the appli|cation of warm wet-cloths, will allow the blood to onze from them for many hours.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to keep the patient's belly con&s;tantly loo&s;e, by &s;uch medicines as children will take; for we ought to be ve|ry attentive not to &s;et them a-crying, as that may &s;uddenly &s;uffocate the child. For this purpo&s;e, I generally u&s;e tablets of <HI>magne&s;ia alba,</HI> made palatable with &s;ugar. Some of the cooling re&s;olvent &s;alts, &s;uch as the chry|&s;tali&s;ed <HI>&s;al polychre&s;t,</HI> di&s;&s;olved in whey, will be of &s;ervice, provided the patient will peace|ably take them.</P>
<P>BLISTERS; applied round the neck, af|ter the ve&s;&s;els are well emptied, do great &s;ervice. They &s;eem to do none, when ap|plied before this time; nay, if the &s;tate is very inflammatory, mu&s;t do much hurt, from their violent <HI>&s;timulus</HI> on the ve&s;&s;els. Emollient fomentations and catapla&s;ms, ap|plied
<PB N="56" REF="57" MS="y">round the neck, are of con&s;iderable u&s;e, and keep up a local evacuation.</P>
<P>THESE evacuations operate in &s;everal dif|ferent ways, <HI>viz.</HI> by thinning the den&s;e <HI>mu|cus,</HI> while yet circulating in the blood; by diverting its flux from the parts affected, as there is a great communication and con&s;ent betwixt the different <HI>mucous</HI> glands thro' the body; but, particularly, by increa&s;ing the ab&s;orbent power of the ve&s;&s;els on emptying them; by which means the purulent mat|ter will be &s;ucked in from the lungs. It was found in the urine of one of the foregoing convale&s;cent patients.</P>
<P>THE re&s;olvent and gently &s;timulating &s;teams of warm water and vinegar, drawn in with the breath, &s;eemed always to have an immediate good effect. Is it from di&s;&s;olving the thick <HI>mucus,</HI> and &s;o oppo&s;ing its concre|tion? That is probably the ca&s;e, as the pa|tient always &s;pits a great deal after it, and the lungs appear moi&s;ter.</P>
<P>VOMITS are, frequently, given in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. They are, generally, thought to be of u&s;e; but I never &s;aw any
<PB N="57" REF="58" MS="y">advantage ari&s;ing from them. I rather &s;u|&s;pect that they mu&s;t be often pernicious, as they increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of <HI>mucus</HI> in the lungs, without expelling it, which is the ve|ry circum&s;tance that, if po&s;&s;ible, we ought, to guard again&s;t. The evacuation that they make otherways is but &s;mall.</P>
<P>GENTLE &s;udorifics may be of &s;ervice, as they divert the flux from the more internal parts to the external. Others think that the&s;e are of u&s;e; and pre&s;cribe the <HI>Vin. emet.</HI> in &s;mall quantities. I cannot &s;ay that I ever &s;aw any great advantage from them.</P>
<P>BUT when the membrane is once form|ed, or the purulent matter, in great quantity, collected in the lungs, evacuations can be no longer of any u&s;e; they rather hurt, as the pul&s;e is then weak. Hence the rea&s;on, why people differ about the effects of evacu|ations in this di&s;ea&s;e; &s;ome deeming them the only certain remedy, while others hold them to be de&s;tructive. Both have built their opinion on fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ts and ob&s;ervation. But as their applications were made in different &s;tages of the di&s;temper, the effects behoved
<PB N="58" REF="59">to be different. What was the only remedy in the inflammatory &s;tate, mu&s;t appear hurt|ful in the purulent.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate of purulency we plainly &s;ee, that nothing can do &s;ervice, but what brings up the matter from the lungs, and that &s;pee|dily too. And pray what medicines can do this? Vomits only evacuate, immediately, the &s;tomach; but by means of the &s;ympa|thy of the nerves, they often bring on a coughing, during their action. They might be of &s;ervice, if they had this &s;alutary effect; but I never &s;aw them an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, though often given with that de&s;ign. The nerves are, indeed, &s;o unactive, that we can entertain no rea&s;onable hopes from this quarter.</P>
<P>SHALL we endeavour to excite a cough, by the means of effluvia, or &s;teams in&s;pired into the lungs? That has been tried, to no purpo&s;e; for the membrane which covers the <HI>trachea,</HI> and the <HI>mucus</HI> or matter which co|vers the lungs, render the&s;e parts in&s;en&s;ible to any external irritation.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="60" MS="y">
<P>To effectuate a &s;olution of the morbid membrane, after it is once completely formed and con&s;olidated, &s;eems to me impo&s;&s;ible by any internal or external medicine that I know. To effectuate its expul&s;ion appears equally impo&s;&s;ible. We have, then, no method re|maining to &s;ave the patient's life, but that of extraction. That cannot be done thro' the <HI>glottis.</HI> When the ca&s;e is de&s;perate, may we not try <HI>bronchotomy?</HI> I can &s;ee no weighty objection to that operation, as the membrane can be &s;o ea&s;ily got at, and is ve|ry loo&s;e. Many a more hazardous opera|tion is daily performed. I would propo&s;e, however, that it &s;hould be fir&s;t tried on a dead &s;ubject, that we may proceed with all manner of caution and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But &s;omething ought to be tried in this dange|rous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>WE have now brought our Inquiry to a conclu&s;ion. The facts, we hope, will ap|pear curious, exact, and &s;ufficiently nume|rous for our purpo&s;e; the method &s;uch as as is u&s;ed in mathematics and natural philo|&s;ophy, for di&s;covering unknown truths; and
<PB N="60" REF="61">the conclu&s;ions new, &s;urpri&s;ing, and natu|rally ari&s;ing from the facts. If we have not brought this Inquiry to that degree of per|fection, in every point, that we could have wi&s;hed, we have the &s;atisfaction, at lea&s;t, to think, that, &s;o far as we go, our di&s;coveries are certain, as they are built on the foun|dation of Nature. Shunning, with all ima|ginable care, fruitle&s;s and deceitful &s;pecula|tions, however entertaining, we have con|&s;tantly kept our facts and experiments in view, as the only road to the improve|ment of medicine, and the good of man|kind.</P>
