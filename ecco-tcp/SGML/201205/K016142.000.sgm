<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;titution of <HI>Ho&s;pitals</HI> in this metropolis for the relief of the <HI>Poor,</HI> afflicted with bodily infirmities, has been, and ju&s;tly too, e&s;teemed one of the noble&s;t of <HI>Charities:</HI> an <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> this, to &s;uccour the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, when their afflictions render them incapable of labouring for their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; where they receive every indulgence their misfortunes can require: the <HI>Sick</HI> being healed, the <HI>Lame</HI> made &s;ound, and both again rendered fit Members of Society, oftentimes to the joy of a young family opening their mouths for bread, &mdash;the fruits of their indu&s;try. How laudable &s;uch in&s;titutions!</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, great mu&s;t be the &s;atisfaction of the Benefactors! This is, indeed, in a very e&s;&s;ential point, acting up to the tenets of the religion we profe&s;s, and following the example of our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour, who went about healing the Sick, and feeding the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>There are, no doubt, many thou&s;and objects equally claiming our compa&s;&s;ion, who, from di&s;tance of &s;ituation, are deprived of the relief. It mu&s;t give infi|nite plea&s;ure to every good Chri&s;tian, to ob&s;erve &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing rendered univer|&s;al over this i&s;land.</P>
<P>Nothing is more practicable.&mdash;May we live to &s;ee &s;ome humane and public-&s;pirited gentleman take it into con&s;ideration, and erect <HI>Ho&s;pitals</HI> in every county in <HI>England!</HI> Surely no phy&s;ical per&s;ons, from mercenary views, will object to it! for, if they reflect, they can be no lo&s;ers in &s;uch unhappy patients being taken off their hands, who have not wherewithal to pay them for their trouble.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o be the means of having more able practitioners in the country:&mdash; A valuable con&s;equence! And, as goodne&s;s meets with its own reward, from the experience of tho&s;e who are appointed to attend the &s;ick, the <HI>Benefactors</HI> them&s;elves may receive a <HI>Benefaction.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome &s;ea-port towns there are Ho&s;pitals, and it is with plea&s;ure to be ob&s;erved that &s;ome few counties have adopted the plan; but in the more inland parts they are greatly wanted, where the inhabitants, though the mo&s;t laborious, are the mo&s;t indigent; and con&s;equently, when infirm, true objects of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Until &s;uch time as this meritorious work is become more univer&s;al, it is pre&s;umed the pre&s;ent de&s;ign will prove acceptable to the <HI>Benevolent,</HI> as it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upplies the defect; at a trifling expence enabling the wealthy, either for their own amu&s;ement, or by means of a &s;ervant, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, <HI>to render Charity to the Needy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of the Family Phy&s;ician is, to direct a right u&s;e of tho&s;e medicines which are nece&s;&s;ary to be kept in fa|milies, who&s;e di&s;tance from a good practitioner, or any other circum&s;tance, renders an immediate application in &s;udden illne&s;&s;es almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, and occa&s;ions tho&s;e delays in trifling complaints, which oftentimes prove of very bad con&s;equence. It has been &s;ound by experience, for want of proper hints and directions in re&s;pect to the do&s;es of medicines, &s;everal fatal errors have been committed; either from the ignorance of per&s;ons them&s;elves, or from being obliged to have recour&s;e, for want of better, to quack medicines, or to the advice of nur&s;es, and &s;uch good women, who&s;e greate&s;t &s;kill extends to the making a po&s;&s;et for a &s;weat, or a pla&s;ter for a &s;ore &s;hin.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e captains of &s;hips who&s;e ve&s;&s;els are too &s;mall to allow of carrying a &s;urgeon, and gentlemen who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s may call them to take a long voyage in &s;uch &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, or to travel by land through unfrequented or poor places, or tho&s;e who are going to &s;ettle in any of his Maje&s;ty's plantations, will find a great advantage from being thus enabled, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, to become their own phy&s;icians; and we often &s;ee that Nature, with a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will free the con&s;titution from di&s;orders which are not too deeply rooted, or very malignant in their fir&s;t attack. I would by no means be under&s;tood to pretend, that the medicines I here recommend are infallible in the re&s;pective di&s;orders they are pre&s;cribed for. They are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;uch only as are to be found in the Di&s;pen|&s;atory of the College of Phy&s;icians: where I have been under a nece&s;&s;ity of compounding, I have attended to the practice of the principal phy&s;icians in town, and my own experience, in &s;electing &s;uch medicines who&s;e operations are the lea&s;t dangerous. Thus far, however, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, by following the&s;e directions, which are plain and ea&s;y, and written in a &s;tile fitted
<PB N="vi" REF="4">to the meane&s;t capacity, <HI>per&s;picuity being always preferable to elegance in this kind of writing,</HI> the patient may, by applying what is nece&s;&s;ary in time, prevent tho&s;e ills that follow from neglect, which good nur&s;ing and a few innocent things might at fir&s;t remove.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have a knowledge in phy&s;ic, and do not &s;tand in need of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will, in the che&s;ts, find many u&s;eful medicines to be kept at hand; and may extend their practice, by giving me a catalogue of &s;uch others as they would chu&s;e to have added.</P>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen, who re&s;ide in the country, will hereby be enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t their poor neighbours; which many of them, I doubt not, would take a plea&s;ure in doing, did they but know what to apply.</P>
<P>With each che&s;t of medicines may be had a box of &s;cales and weights; each weight marked di&s;tinctly, that any per&s;on may at once adju&s;t the proper quantity for a do&s;e.</P>
<P>As many per&s;ons may chu&s;e to keep by them what is proper for their own particular complaints, whom it may not &s;uit to have the box complete, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that any of the medicines here recommended may be had &s;eparately, or as many of them as agreeable, packed up in le&s;&s;er boxes for the conveniency of carriage.</P>
<P>For the &s;atisfaction of the public, in order that they may depend upon the medicines, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to mention that &s;uch compo&s;itions as are not made under my immediate in&s;pection are prepared at Apothecaries-Hall.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;ugge&s;ted to the author, that it would be more eligible to print the Family Phy&s;ician in a &s;mall pocket-volume, the &s;ize of his Letters to Married Women, and indeed he had &s;ome thoughts of &s;o printing this edition; but, upon mature deliberation, a <HI>quarto</HI> &s;eems be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer the inten|tion of this work.</P>
<P>The Family Phy&s;ician is &s;eldom or never removed from the place where the medicines are kept, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure obviates the objection to a <HI>quarto</HI> volume: add to this the advantage of a larger margin, which enables the reader to make his own notes and ob&s;ervations; and the blank &s;heets which are now interleaved will further a&s;&s;i&s;t the laudable de&s;igns of the intelligent and bene|volent.</P>
<P>The author received the la&s;t hint from a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, who has made a very judicious u&s;e of blank leaves, by in&s;erting the hi&s;tories of remarkable ca&s;es oppo&s;ite to the medicines which effected a cure. Such memorandums may not only prove &s;ervice|able to tho&s;e who take the trouble of making them, but may likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t others upon a future occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Experience in phy&s;ic is the wi&s;e&s;t path to tread; and con&s;i|dering what poor crazy con&s;titutions too many of the human race unhappily &s;u&s;tain, and the various di&s;orders which even the mo&s;t robu&s;t are liable to, no one can be too particular in remarking &s;uch innocent remedies as may relieve &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions, and con&s;equently prevent terrible and fatal di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
<P>Good nur&s;ing is a point which has either been too much neglected, or mi&s;taken; neverthele&s;s it is of the fir&s;t con&s;equence towards the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and the preserving of delicate and feeble con&s;titutions. It is equally &s;o to render advanced age ea&s;y and comfortable; and to pre&s;erve helple&s;s infants. To &s;peculative minds it mu&s;t be matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to ob&s;erve the fatality among&s;t children, which the following table of births and infant|burials, collected from the bills of mortality, pre&s;ents for their &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>The average upon the la&s;t ten years.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that almo&s;t two thirds of the children born in this metropolis and its environs are intirely lo&s;t to &s;ociety: 16283 are, upon the average, the annual births; 10145 the infant|burials; and, what de&s;erves particular attention, 7987 are cut off before they are two years old, which is more than three fourths of tho&s;e children who die under five years of age. How ardently therefore is it to be wi&s;hed that &s;uch a fatality could be prevented I &mdash;it may be prevented.</P>
<PB N="x" REF="8">
<P>Is it not affecting, that &s;o many beings, ju&s;t entering into life, &s;hould be &s;o untimely cut off, to the detriment of &s;ociety, and the affliction of their weeping mothers? It is, truly, a &s;ubject of commi&s;eration, a &s;cene which draws a &s;ilent tear from the eye of humanity, and pierces the wounded bo&s;oms of afflicted parents.&mdash;Above three fourths of the&s;e little innocents fall a &s;acrifice under two years old. It is well known, that the thru&s;h and watery gripes generally terminate their exi&s;tence in the early months; and if they &s;urvive the&s;e maladies, the time of teething too frequently brings on a fatal cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Could we but conquer the prejudices of the times, and aboli&s;h unnatural and ab&s;urd practices; could we but re&s;tore that natural and &s;imple method of rearing children, which the all-wi&s;e Giver of life has &s;ufficiently pointed out; did we but confine them to that nutriment which HE has prepared for their fir&s;t &s;tate of exi&s;tence; and con&s;ult that rea&s;on which He has be&s;towed upon us to conduct them forwards&mdash;all would be well. But alas, indolence and luxury forbid the ta&s;k! Neverthele&s;s, to the rati|onal few the following remarks are &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>The thru&s;h and watery gripes are, in the author's opi|nion, artificial di&s;ea&s;es, and both of them totally occa&s;ioned by improper food; &s;uch as all kinds of pap, whether made from flour, bread, or bi&s;cuit: they all cau&s;e too much fermentation in the &s;tomach, and irritate their tender bowels beyond what nature can &s;upport. This appears to him to be the evident cau&s;e of the before-mentioned complaints.</P>
<P>When infants are pa&s;t this period, the danger in cutting their teeth is ju&s;tly to be feared. This difficulty proceeds altogether from a weakne&s;s of con&s;titution, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame fir&s;t mi&s;taken cau&s;e in point of diet: and here a train of dreadful &s;ymptoms pre&s;ent them&s;elves; the head, the &s;tomach, the bowels, are all at times terribly affected; a general wa&s;ting of the body frequently en&s;ues, and unconquerable fevers prevail, which gene|rally terminate in convul&s;ions and death.</P>
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
<P>To prevent all the&s;e unhappy con&s;equences, let us but for a moment reflect that every mother is de&s;igned by Nature to fo&s;ter her own child. If the brea&s;t is not to be obtained, cows milk is in general to be preferred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the pre&s;ervation of children, the author has cau&s;ed the Milk-pots, which he invented to &s;upply the place of the brea&s;t, to be made in the Queen's ware, in order that the poor, who cannot afford to purcha&s;e &s;ilver ones, may be accom|modated; and this natural method of feeding infants with milk only will, upon experiment, be found &s;o much more convenient to their nur&s;es, that he hopes to &s;ee it generally adopted, whereby the lives of thou&s;ands will annually be pre&s;erved.
<P>A piece of fine rag &s;hould be tied loo&s;ely round the &s;pout of the Milk-pot, with which the children will be equally plea&s;ed as with the nipple of the brea&s;t it&s;elf.</P></NOTE> to any kind of &s;ood that can be invented, becau&s;e it is nearly &s;imilar to that which Nature intended. But it would be &s;welling the&s;e pages unnece&s;&s;arily to enter further upon the management of children, as the treati&s;e promi&s;ed in the preface to the la&s;t edition of this work is now publi&s;hed under the title of LETTERS TO MARRIED WOMEN, which is intended as a companion for the &s;ick chamber and the nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>This book is dedicated to the ladies, as a grateful tribute due to them for their tender care; an humble offering meet to be laid at the feet of tho&s;e, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion and delicacy greatly contribute to render the misfortunes of life &s;upportable, and who&s;e not lea&s;t endearing province is, where amiable characters may be drawn, the &s;ick chamber and the nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>It would be ungrateful in the author not to acknowledge the candour with which the public have been plea&s;ed to receive that little volume, although it contains &s;ome doctrines repugnant to the pre&s;ent opinions. With a view then to promote the happine&s;s and comfort of his fellow-creatures, and to pre&s;erve helple&s;s infants from their pre&s;ent almo&s;t certain death, he begs leave to recom|mend the peru&s;al of tho&s;e Letters to &s;uch as are likely to have a young family; and al&s;o to tho&s;e who&s;e duty may require their
<PB N="xii" REF="10">attendance in a &s;ick chamber, and likewi&s;e to invalids. They will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly find their account in attending to the maxims there laid down, which are evident to common &s;en&s;e, and the re&s;ult of an a&s;&s;iduous attention to the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion; and it may with truth be added, that they have the further &s;anction of many years &s;ucce&s;sful experience.</P>

<HEAD>ON DIET.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the phy&s;ician, by means of medicines, has &s;ubdued a di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s the patient is put upon a proper method of diet, exerci&s;e, &amp;c. to prevent a relap&s;e, his work is often|times in vain. A few observations upon food, to enable per&s;ons, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to judge for them&s;elves of the fit or unfit, will, I tru&s;t, prove acceptable; as phy&s;ic and good nur&s;ing ought ever to go hand in hand. My reader will remember I am giving directions to invalids; the glutton will not be &s;atisfied with my meal, neither will the epicure reli&s;h my di&s;hes. Yet I would wi&s;h this friendly caution to be attended to even by the vaunters of health; place not too much confidence in the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;trength of a good con&s;titution, one night's debauch may too late convince you&mdash;you are mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to Vegetables. Tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to live free from burning fevers, and e&s;cape the rage of inflammatory di&s;orders, particularly if their con&s;titutions have been already &s;haken by &s;uch complaints, cannot u&s;e them too plentifully; tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tomachs are weakened by di&s;ea&s;e, will find the tender vegetable diet frees them from the oppre&s;&s;ive labour, that &s;lted meats require to make them fit for nouri&s;hment: on the contrary,
<PB N="2" REF="12">where the con&s;titution is &s;ubject to gouty complaints, and particu|larly if the &s;tomach has been affected by frequent &s;pa&s;ms, &s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t be exceedingly cautious in the u&s;e or vegetables, e&s;pecially at the time the &s;tomach is di&s;ordered. One gro&s;s mi&s;|take which we lie under I cannot pa&s;s by unnoticed; I mean the pernicious practice of eating pepper with &s;uch food, and it is &s;till wor&s;e if it be not finely powdered, which is generally the ca&s;e; gouty per&s;ons who plead this nece&s;&s;ity, would do better to avoid vegetables; and the common argument in vindication of its &s;uppo&s;ed excellency is, that it prevents vegetables from colick|ing. I am well convinced, and &s;peak from experience, that it is often-times the rea&s;on why vegetables occa&s;ion the colic, which might clearly be demon&s;trated: but it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s here to enter into arguments; all that I mean, is to give &s;ome u&s;eful hints to tho&s;e who find it nece&s;&s;ary to nur&s;e them&s;elves, and to correct &s;ome common errors in our method of living. Thus far I grant, if the man who has been long accu&s;tomed to high|&s;ea&s;oned &s;oups, rich wines, and cordial liquors, was of a &s;udden to change his diet to melons and cucumbers, he would very proba|bly feel &s;ome di&s;agreeable effects from it: but even when the appetite has been many years pampered, and the body accu&s;|tomed to heating food; yet, by degrees, with a prudent regu|lation, &s;tep by &s;tep, the method of living may be again changed to the more whole&s;ome and cooling diet. This is a piece of advice well worthy of notice, for in many con&s;titutional di&s;orders it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be complied with. Do not mi&s;take me, I am far from thinking it needful for every one who does not boa&s;t a good &s;tate of health to &s;ubmit him&s;elf intirely to a vege|table and milk diet; on the contrary, I am truly &s;en&s;ible that a moderate u&s;e of fle&s;h is far from being unwhole&s;ome; nay, it is even nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome delicate con&s;titutions, and for tho&s;e who u&s;e much exerci&s;e, or are required to labour. It is not the prudent u&s;e, but the abu&s;e of the&s;e things I mean to caution you again&s;t.</P>
<P>Of vegetables; the turnip, par&s;nip, potatoe, are very good; fruits, and fruit-pies, &s;allads of all kinds, and pot-herbs, are whole&s;ome; which I would recommend to mo&s;t per&s;ons, and in
<PB N="3" REF="13">a particular manner to the young and growing, and to tho&s;e who have craving appetites, becau&s;e &s;uch food will prevent them eat|ing too large a quantity of fle&s;h; and the&s;e vegetables being ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; after a full meal pa&s;s off quickly, and leave the &s;to|mach more at liberty to exert its force upon that aliment which requires &s;o much more time and labour to dige&s;t.</P>
<P>I come next to &s;peak of Animal-food. One general rule, which &s;eldom &s;hould be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by the infirm, I mu&s;t beg leave to lay down: Never eat fle&s;h more than once a day, and that at noon. The plain roa&s;t and boiled, whether butchers meat or poultry, is far preferable to made-di&s;hes; there is danger to be dreaded, not only from the noxious qualities of the ingredients u&s;ed to pre|pare &s;uch kitchen poi&s;ons, but al&s;o from the quantities which are devoured of them; for the&s;e &s;avory &s;cents and ta&s;tes &s;o quicken the appetite, that people gorge them&s;elves, and regard not the dictates of nature, ever to be ob&s;erved, and which, if attended to, will always inform us when the &s;tomach has received a &s;ufficient &s;upply. Animal-food, which has been any con&s;iderable time in &s;alt, becomes hard, and requires more force to break and dige&s;t it, proper for nouri&s;hment, than weak &s;tomachs are capable of ex|erting; con&s;equently, &s;alted beef, pork, and &s;uch-like things, are improper for children, invalids, and aged per&s;ons. Notwith|&s;tanding what I have &s;aid, &s;alt is very whole&s;ome to be eaten with fle&s;h; and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;timulus which &s;alt gives to the coats of the &s;tomach, makes them exert their power with greater force upon the food; and, of cour&s;e, helps dige&s;tion:&mdash;hence, though &s;alted meats are improper, it is from the effect which &s;alt has upon fle&s;h that lies long in it; in render|ing it hard, and unfit for nouri&s;hment; not the &s;alt it&s;elf, that is hurtful. Broths of all kinds, which are not &s;ea&s;oned, are whole|&s;ome; broths contain the juices of the fle&s;h they are made from, which is the part proper for nouri&s;hment: &mdash;hence, although your made, high-&s;ea&s;oned gravies are to be avoided, tho&s;e gravies which run out of fle&s;h upon cutting it after it is brought to table, are
<PB N="4" REF="14">good and nouri&s;hing, becau&s;e they are nothing more than the juices of the meat.</P>
<P>FISH in general are good, particularly &s;hell-fi&s;h; but let us re|member, that by &s;tewing them with high-&s;ea&s;oned gravies, and &s;uch-like arts, they, though innocent in their nature, may be rendered as formidable poi&s;ons as your ragoes, &amp;c.&mdash;witne&s;s the &s;acrifices made to health at a turtle-fea&s;t.</P>
<P>MILK is a valuable food indeed! this requires little or no labour from the &s;tomach; it has already pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch &s;trainers, as render it a kind and whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment. This caution I mu&s;t give, becau&s;e cu&s;tom has made it almo&s;t a general practice,&mdash;never eat milk with acid fruits&mdash;rea&s;on tells us it is wrong: codlings and milk or cream, &s;trawberries, ra&s;berries, &amp;c. are highly improper to be eaten together; for, by mixing the&s;e acid fruits with the milk, it is the mo&s;t likely method to make it curdle too ha&s;tily in the &s;tomach; of which every one who will give him&s;elf time to think mu&s;t be convinced. Almo&s;t all the kitchen preparations of milk are whole&s;ome, &s;uch as cu&s;tards, white-pots, blamange, &amp;c. Much indeed might be &s;aid upon this head; but as it is treated at large in my Letters to Married Women, I &s;hall beg leave to refer my readers to them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of knowing the nature and properties of milk, and of under&s;tanding its &s;uperior excellence. It is a nutriment the mo&s;t &s;imple, yet the mo&s;t perfect. It requires no labour from the dige&s;tive faculties, yet fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every principle of nouri&s;hment, to give &s;trength to infants, and health to the infirm. Would to God that this natural and &s;alubrious diet was more particularly attended to! One thing, however, let me ob&s;erve; a little &s;alt being &s;prinkled into milk will often|times prevent its curdling too ha&s;tily upon the &s;tomach, where it meets with an acidity, and is particularly to be recommended for children; in general, milk is be&s;t without boiling; if it purges, it mu&s;t be boiled. You will find an excellent method of u&s;ing it in the directions for giving &s;alop in the Family Phy|&s;ician.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="15">
<P>With re&s;pect to Liquids.&mdash;It would take up too much time to enter upon them here.&mdash;We are, however, too fond of acidu|lated liquors, e&s;pecially in &s;ick chambers. The doctrine of acids, in my opinion, has been carried to an extravagant length. I mean to caution the reader again&s;t too free an u&s;e of them; and as it is im|po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cu&s;s this point at pre&s;ent, let your own ob&s;ervations direct you with regard to your general plan, and abide by &s;uch liquors as be&s;t agree with your con&s;titution. I &s;hall conclude this head with a few remarks upon eggs.&mdash;Eggs are a fine food for weak &s;tomachs, but our method of eating them is very erro|neous:&mdash;they certainly afford much nouri&s;hment, and that without labour to the &s;tomach; but if they are heated &s;o as to &s;et the yolk, they will never properly dige&s;t. Some time &s;ince I attended a gentleman who was troubled with a vomiting and purging, and notwith&s;tanding the u&s;ual remedies were applied, the di&s;order continued very violent for ten days:&mdash;he had taken a gentle puke at the beginning of the complaint; but finding it would not &s;ubmit to the medicines afterwards given, it plainly appeared to me the cau&s;e of the di&s;order was &s;till in the &s;tomach, and &s;o it proved; for, upon another vomit being admini&s;tered, a large quantity of undige&s;ted egg came off his &s;tomach, which, upon recollection, he remembered to have eaten two days before he was ill, a circum&s;tance that e&s;caped his memory at the time I fir&s;t attended him, and, upon its coming away, the di&s;order left him. This remarkable in&s;tance led me to reflect upon the nature of eggs,&mdash;and ever after made me careful, when I recom|mended them, to give a &s;trict charge that they were not boiled hard; and, indeed, the method I have found mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, where patients have been much emaciated, is the following&mdash; Take a new-laid egg, and beat it in a ba&s;on as you would do to make a pudding; then add half a gla&s;s of madeira, mountain, or mead, to it, and let it be thus taken, with or without a bit of bread; by this means it is rendered palatable, &s;its ea&s;y on the &s;tomach, and will &s;urely turn to nouri&s;hment:&mdash;&s;everal patients to whom I have recommended eggs, that have not been able to
<PB N="6" REF="16">keep any other nouri&s;hment, have, in this manner, eaten one, two, and, &s;ometimes, three eggs in a day, which for a con&s;i|derable time have been their only &s;upport.</P>
<P>From the&s;e hints, I think it no difficult matter for tho&s;e who are in an indifferent &s;tate of health to find out a method of diet &s;uitable to their own con&s;titutions; and it is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that every man at the age of forty, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, is either a fool or a phy&s;ician.</P>

You &s;hould begin when the fever is gone intirely off, and give at lea&s;t one ounce before you expect it to return<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In low fenny countries, where the atmo&s;phere is moi&s;t and foggy, it is &s;ome|times nece&s;&s;ary to give one ounce and a half of bark between the fits, but in gene|ral an ounce is &s;ufficient.</NOTE>; half a dram, two &s;cruples, or a dram may be given for a do&s;e, as the &s;tomach will bear it; the le&s;s you admini&s;ter at a time the more frequently it mu&s;t be repeated; for, unle&s;s you get the whole quantity down within the time, you do nothing.</P>

<P>WE frequently, and with &s;ucce&s;s, for children, and tho&s;e of delicate con&s;titutions, boil brui&s;ed bark a long while in water, and give the &s;trained liquor in&s;tead of the powder in &s;ub&s;tance; the proportion is, an ounce in two or three pints of water, till you can pour off one.

<P>For the piles it is &s;ometimes thought &s;erviceable; as likewi&s;e in female ob&s;tructions, and frequently in rheumatic complaints; in apoplectic di&s;orders, a dy&s;entery or bloody-flux, and irk&s;ome heat of the bowels; for the hooping cough, particularly if of a full habit of body, and the phlegm which is brought up appears &s;treaked with blood; in all which ca&s;es, the quantity taken away mu&s;t be proportioned to the age of the patient, and the violence of the complaint.</P>
<P>Bleeding again is &s;ometimes directed in large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es or &s;wel|lings, where the heat and pain is immoderate; for, in the&s;e ca&s;es, by drawing blood, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the matter is more ea&s;ily and &s;peedily brought to ripen, and, by that means, the body more effectually freed from its di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>In a word, wherever prevail &s;ore eyes, &s;ciatica or hip-gout, a dry hu&s;ky cough, an head-ach, pains of the womb or of the bladder, dry gripes, &s;trangury, gravel, pain from the &s;tone, violent bleed|ings of the no&s;e, ears, or other parts, an inveterate &s;corbutical itch, and the like, opening a vein is e&s;teemed of peculiar &s;ervice; but in drop&s;ies, a jaundice, the gout, and all illne&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by a relaxed &s;tate of body, an impoveri&s;hed blood, or too great weakne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, you mu&s;t &s;eek relief from the medicines recom|mended in this little manual, and not, by an abrupt and prepo&s;|terous u&s;e of bleeding, increa&s;e the di&s;order, and ruin the health of the patient and your own reputation.</P>
<P>The reader will be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand, that what has been &s;aid concerning the taking away blood is in conformity to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities, and the pre&s;ent practice. I will now beg leave to add my own opinion, <HI>that it would be happy for mankind if a lancet had never been invented.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ON THE APPLICATION OF BLISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the cautions here laid down, with re&s;pect to bleeding, I &s;hall add a word or two concerning the application of bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t excellent remedy may be pro&s;tituted by an incon&s;ide|rate, ra&s;h, and fooli&s;h practice; which, it is plain, oftentimes happens with regard to bli&s;ters, by ordering them indi&s;crimi|nately in all fevers, and without di&s;tinction in any time of the di&s;temper, which can only be the effect of ignorance.</P>
<P>Therefore, before we re&s;olve on an expedient of this nature, it will be convenient to con&s;ider whether the fever be of the in|flammatory or nervous kind; if of the former, in&s;tead of bli&s;tering the lancet is generally u&s;ed, and a mild cooling regimen &s;et on foot, as already directed; this will moderate the heat of the blood, and, by degrees, re&s;tore it to its due temper. On the other hand, in fevers of the nervous cla&s;s, where the &s;ymptoms are quite diffe|rent, the pul&s;e being low and weak, the &s;pirits almo&s;t &s;pent, and the eyes, in&s;tead of appearing &s;parkling, red and fiery, grown quite dim, we ought, by all means, to make u&s;e of bli&s;ters, and that freely.</P>
<P>They are oftentimes proper in paralytic and nervous complaints, as likewi&s;e in rheumatic pains and pleuri&s;ies, in which ca&s;es a bli&s;|ter applied immediately upon the part affected frequently affords great relief; and in a variety of other ca&s;es they are of infinite &s;ervice: but then regard mu&s;t be paid to the &s;tate of the patient's blood; for, if a full, quick pul&s;e, great heat, thir&s;t, and the other
<PB N="39" REF="49">&s;ymptoms of an inflammatory fever attend upon the di&s;orders, the fever mu&s;t fir&s;t be conquered, and afterwards, if nece&s;&s;ity requires it, let bli&s;ters be applied. Should they cau&s;e a &s;trangury, which will &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e, give the patient plentifully of mar&s;h|mallow drink, or barley water with a little gum arabic di&s;&s;olved in it; or if there is a purging, which you would wi&s;h to be &s;topped, of the hart&s;horn drink; and this inconvenience will &s;oon be remedied.</P>
<P>In regard to the management of bli&s;ters, the pla&s;ter &s;hould be &s;pread upon a piece of an old glove, and bound on to the part intended; after twenty-four hours, the &s;trength of the flies being pretty well &s;pent, you may remove the bli&s;ter, and, if you cannot procure the proper dre&s;&s;ings, a little Turner's cerate, &s;pread upon a piece of fine rag, may &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>Should any bli&s;ters appear unbroken, &s;nip them with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars; if they give violent pain, this may be done when the pla&s;ter has been applied only twelve hours; when, by di&s;charging the water, and laying it &s;moothly on again, you ea&s;e the patient, and give the bli&s;ter an opportunity of acting more effectually.</P>
<P>Thus much has been advanced in conformity to the pre&s;ent practice, in which I have endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t the intelligent reader, by familiar language, to form clear ideas of the various di&s;ea&s;es treated of in this book. The cure of di&s;ea&s;es is certainly a laudable and noble &s;tudy. It is a &s;cience which dignifies human nature: many important truths have been illu&s;trated both by the antients, and &s;ome modern writers&mdash;<HI>yet much remains to be known:</HI> which future experience and accurate ob&s;ervation may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover. Permit me to &s;ay that, in my humble &s;tation, I have reaped the advantage of both; and if a di&s;tant period &s;hould afford me lei&s;ure regularly to dige&s;t my thoughts upon the cura|tive intention of di&s;ea&s;es, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to promulge doctrines, which are, perhaps, at this time not generally under&s;tood: and if I continue to be &s;o happy as to recommend them by a &s;ucce&s;s|ful practice, I hope to live to &s;ee my opinions generally adopted by medical practitioners, for the good of this country, and the benefit of the world in general.</P>
