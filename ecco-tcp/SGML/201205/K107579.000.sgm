<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS to You, as proper <HI>Arbi|ters</HI> of &s;ound and artful Pra|cti&s;e, that I addre&s;s the following Ca&s;e: You who at pre&s;ent are placed at the
<PB N="ii" REF="3">Helm; and who&s;e peculiar Provinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is to in&s;pect whether or no this re|nowned Art be rightly &s;teer'd by it &s;everal Practitioners, will quickly &s;ee (as the following <HI>Diary</HI> has been kept whether, or no the Practice therein ob|&s;erv'd, be every Way conformable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Rules of Art.</P>
<P>That it is truly &s;tated, I dare ap|peal to one of you, Mr. Warden <HI>He|renden,</HI> who was at &s;everal Time plea&s;ed to be an Eye-Witne&s;s, at the Times of Dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that my Patient at length dying, I might have conceal'd the Ca&s;e, as affording le&s;s Matter of In&s;truction to the young Practitioner: for whom principally it was intended; I an&s;wer, and that without vain Boa&s;t|ing, there is more of Art requir'd to protract Life, under the mo&s;t immi|nent Danger, than there is to accom|pli&s;h
<PB N="iii" REF="4">a Cure where that Danger is ab|&s;ent: And farther, whatever it may appear to others, I dare &s;ay 'twill be no Paradox to you, &s;hould I affirm that the remarkable and &s;uccesful Re|coveries of &s;ome, have been in great Mea|&s;ure owing to the rational, altho' &s;ucce&s;le&s;s Attempts upon others.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;ection that has been employ'd upon Morbid Bodyes after Death, has enrich'd both <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Surgery,</HI> with many u&s;eful Improvements, and he who thinks it not worth while to take Notice of any other Ca&s;e, than where a Cure has been completed: is lea&s;t likely to be in&s;trumental in the Performance of any one that is extraordinary.</P>
<P>I pretend to no new Light in <HI>Sur|gery:</HI> Nor &s;hall I by any means recede from the old, unle&s;s that enlightned Gentleman Dr. <HI>C.</HI>&mdash; can by <HI>Autop&s;y</HI> convince me, that any con&s;iderably
<PB N="iv" REF="5">contus'd Wound is to be cur'd by other fir&s;t Intention, than that of Dige&s;tion or engendring matter: 'Till this be done, he is to excu&s;e me if I think him more in the dark than tho&s;e who never heard of his fal&s;e <HI>Meteor,</HI> and quickly ex|tingui&s;h'd Light.</P>
<P>That Wounds of the <HI>Brain,</HI> and other Noble Parts, are inconditionately curable: &s;eems of a like Stretch with the former; yet want we not a late Blazing Star, in Compari&s;on of the le&s;|&s;er Light, from t'other &s;ide the Water, to portend they are &s;o.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e Immortali&s;ers of Man|kind, could perform what they pretend to; how comes it to pa&s;s that not one more &s;urpri&s;ing (if well atte&s;ted Re|covery) has hen wrought by them, than we are able to produce in the Way of common Practice, perform'd by Inge|niuos Arti&s;ts, long before the World
<PB N="v" REF="6">was fobb'd by the&s;e arrogant Pre|tences?</P>
<P>'Tis evident there never wanted &s;ome bold and confident Pretender to work Wonders in each Art or Science: <HI>Phy|&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Phylo&s;ophy,</HI> as well as <HI>Ma|thematicks</HI> have had their Hereticks equally with <HI>Divinity:</HI> Nor was there ever any thing (how ab&s;urd &s;o ever) &s;tarted by Phylo&s;ophers of differing Sects, but quickly gain'd its Pro&s;elues, among&s;t unthinking and unwary Per&s;ons. Thus on the one hand, no &s;onner does the Knavi&s;h or (at be&s;t) deluded <HI>Facio</HI> and his Crew &s;ound forth the Trumpet, but Herds of Fellow Prophets take the Alarm, and Men, di&s;tingui&s;h'd, as well by Sen&s;e as Title and E&s;tate, are drawn in among&s;t the beedle&s;s Rabble.</P>
<P>On the other, no &s;ooner does the bold and co&s;ening <HI>Quack,</HI> confidently avouch that he can cure the mo&s;t in|vetrate
<PB N="vi" REF="7"><HI>Clap</HI> in two or three Days, and a <HI>Pox</HI> of the &s;uperlative Degree, in as many Weeks; but Shoals of fornicating Sinners (neglecting Men of Art and great|er Mode&s;ty) run after him to court their Ruine: I need not tell you, how many of this Scandalous Tribe, our City af|fords, who live great, and appear &s;plen|did, by the Spoil of the&s;e mo&s;t &s;hame|fully abu&s;ed People.</P>
<P>Again, no &s;ooner does the &s;ly in&s;inu|ating <HI>V</HI>&mdash; (the Scandal of our Reve|rend Clergy) publi&s;h to the World his Cures of the <HI>Kings Evil,</HI> where com|mon <HI>Ulcers,</HI> and as common <HI>Opthal|mies</HI> make up the Number; and all Mi&s;cariages are hu&s;ht up: but &s;trait the bubbled Citizens care&s;s the empty Idol, and fear not the Abu&s;e under a Reli|gious Ca&s;&s;ock.</P>
<P><HI>No&s;trums</HI> and <HI>Specificks,</HI> tho&s;e Subterfuges of Ignorance and Baits for
<PB N="vii" REF="8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nwary, are every where to be met with. But whil&s;t their Owners are &s;o &s;hy of being brought to the Te&s;t of Rational <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nqui&s;ition, whil&s;t they &s;helter them|&s;elves only under the Umbrage of (how|ever honourable yet) incompetent Judges: we may very well di&s;regard them, nor need we be at the Pains of confuting them otherways, than by (what they only de&s;erve) our Slight and Contempt.</P>
<P>If common Fame, or the lying Tat|tle of the Multitude is to be taken for Authentic Evidence: I can produce a Noonday Sun which will ob&s;cure the&s;e le&s;&s;er Lights at once: For if the Dr. finds his vouchers for his Cure of Wounds of the <HI>Heart, Stomach, Liver, Guts,</HI> and what not; or the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nobleman who drives <HI>Tenter-Hooks</HI> thro' Mens Heads, healing them in a Trice with his <HI>Con&s;olidator.</HI> I'll bring One to te&s;tifie he heard a Per&s;on
<PB N="viii" REF="9">&s;ware, that I had taken out &s;ome of a Child's Brains (the &s;ame in the en&s;uing Narative) wa&s;hed them in warm Claret, and put them in again: after which, in in a few Minutes he was as merry as a Cricket.</P>
<P>But leaving the&s;e Romantick Boa&s;t|ers, among&s;t <HI>Knaves</HI> and <HI>Fools,</HI> the bare mentioning of whom I fear is a Tre&s;pa&s;s upon your Patience: I hope 'tis no novel A&s;&s;ertion, if I do affirm, that the wounded Brain is conditionately cu|rable; had I not been able to produce Authorities, great Variety of which the Judicious Mr. <HI>Young</HI> of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> has collected to my hand: I can a&s;&s;ert it upon my own Knowledge, in a little Girl I was call'd to many Years ago, who by Accident, had an Iron Spike beat into her Brain, thoro' the mid&s;t of the <HI>Os Frontis,</HI> accompany'd with a Fracture, in which, upon Removal of
<PB N="ix" REF="10">the <HI>Scalp,</HI> one Part of the <HI>Cranium</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">as found &s;hot under the other. The Wound had been treated by a Barber, as Superficial; taking off who&s;e Dre&s;|&s;ings, I perceiv'd &s;ome of the Brain mixt with his Bal&s;am, and pa&s;&s;ing in my Probe, ob&s;erv'd there was an Admit|tance farther than I car'd to venture; I dre&s;t her up that Night, believing the Ca&s;e de&s;perate: Next Day I traced the Fracture, and making Room for the <HI>Trepan,</HI> call'd in Mr. Serjeant <HI>Ber|nard,</HI> perforating the fir&s;t Time, whil&s;t he was by; the <HI>Membrane</HI> appear'd fair and clean, but by this Perforation we were not able to relieve that Part of it which was oppre&s;t, by &s;ome Angles of the fractur'd Bone; on which Account I made a &s;econd Bore, and &s;aw'd off the <HI>Inter&s;tice,</HI> which contain'd the doubled Fragment of the offending <HI>Cra|nium.</HI> Our <HI>Membrane,</HI> now lay

<P>From the <HI>Sedes</HI> in the Forehead, we had daily &s;ome Portion of the Brain di&s;charg'd; I believe in all a moderate Spoonfull, which at length cea&s;ing to work out: in&s;tead thereof, there ouzed forth a large Quantity of an in&s;ipid Water, or clear <HI>Lymph,</HI> at lea&s;t a Pint in each twelve Hours; which continued till the Edges of the <HI>Sedes</HI> mouldred off, about which time, &s;ome Grains of Fle&s;h began to ari&s;e from within, &s;oon after growing <HI>Cal|lous,</HI> and bearing a firm <HI>Cicatrix.</HI> The Patient is now grown a lu&s;ty Young Woman, a Wife, and Mother of Children; and from the Minute &s;he re|ceiv'd

<P>How ju&s;tly this Reflection was made, <HI>I</HI> take this Opportunity of in|forming you, and delivering the Bu&s;ine&s;s truly in as few Words as I can, &s;hall leave you to determine.</P>

The Child upon the healing of the Wound, was &s;eized with an <HI>He|miplegia:</HI> the <HI>Eye</HI> and <HI>Lip</HI> di&s;tort|ed, the Arm in a Manner u&s;ele&s;s; and the Leg drawing after him, ac|company'd indeed with a partial Lo&s;s

<P>Whil&s;t I was delivering my Prog|no&s;tic of the Child's great Danger, and telling them of the Nece&s;&s;ity there was to make Way to the Fra|cture, by removing &s;ome Part of the <HI>Scalp,</HI> the Boy began to cry and fell a vomiting.

<P>The next Day I call'd in Mr. <HI>Blun|del,</HI> and together vi&s;iting, we found the Child had been hot and re&s;tle&s;s all Night. His retching to vomit having left him: When we had taken him out of Bed, and placed him in a good Light, I took off the Bandage and Dre&s;&s;ings, and pa&s;&s;ing a Probe into the Wound, plainly felt the <HI>Cra|nium</HI> for a great Compa&s;s, denudated of its Covering.</P>
<P>I began to draw a &s;emicircular Line on the Out&s;ide of the Depre&s;&s;ion, as a Direction for my Knife; and ano|ther perpendicular from the one Point to the other; that we might feel the
<PB N="4" REF="24">Extent of the Fracture, before we re+moved any more of the <HI>Scalp.</HI> The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> whil&s;t Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; kept the Head &s;tea|dy, I cut thro' my half Circle to the <HI>Cranium,</HI> and found I was ju&s;t beyond the Edge of the fractur'd Bone; but drawing my Knife upon the &s;treight Line, it &s;lipt in a con&s;iderable Di|&s;tance from the Superfice unawares; which Mr. <HI>B</HI> &mdash; perceiving, I with|drew the &s;ame to make Way for his Finger, by which he di&s;cover'd &s;o great a Vacuity, that we conclud|ed the Bones were beat thro' both <HI>Meninges</HI> into the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Brain.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, he approv'd of my making another Semicircle, and ta|king off the <HI>Scalp</HI> on the oppo&s;ite Side, by which we might have the whole Fracture in full View, accor|dingly I di&s;patch' the Work, and took from the <HI>Scalp</HI> a Circle, in all as large, or &s;omewhat larger than a five Shil|ling Piece: when immediately we di&s;|cover'd this va&s;t Fracture and Depre&s;|&s;ion (exactly enough delineated in the following Table) of four Angles, &s;unk
<PB N="5" REF="25">&s;o low beneath the Surface of the other Part of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> as to make a Cavity &s;ufficient to contain near two Ounces of Liquor.</P>
<P>The outward Table was broke all round, whil&s;t the inward was only bow'd: upon which Account there was no room for an Elevator, or in|deed any other In&s;trument, by which we could hope to rai&s;e up the depre&s;t Bones, without the Help of the <HI>Tre|pan.</HI> The <HI>Terebra</HI> was propos'd, but concluded in&s;ufficient as well as ha|zardous; in&s;ufficient to lift up the Bones, unle&s;s we could go quite thro', and hazardous by going thro', of wounding the <HI>Dura Mater;</HI> which if not lacerated by the prodigious Stretch, mu&s;t needs bear tight again&s;t the In|fide of the fractur'd Bone. The <HI>Tre|pan</HI> in &s;o young a Child was thought likewi&s;e to have its Danger: the <HI>Mem|brane</HI> in young Children lying high, and in a Manner continuous to the In&s;ide of the <HI>Scull.</HI></P>
<P>However, here was no room for long Delay, the fore&s;aid Part &s;ubja|cent, being &s;o wonderfully oppre&s;s'd
<PB N="6" REF="26">by the Points of the Bones, thro' the Clefts of which we might perceive a manife&s;t O&s;cillation. Yet for the pre|&s;ent we could do nothing more, be|ing di&s;turbed in our Work, by a Flux of Blood from an inci&s;ed Artery, to the Mouth of which I clapt a &s;mall Button of Lint, dipt in equal Parts of <HI>Bole</HI> and <HI>Vitriol,</HI> fill'd up the Ca|vity and Edges with dry Lint, and a Compre&s;s wrung out of <HI>Oxycrate</HI> and <HI>Albumen Ovi,</HI> &s;trow'd with <HI>Fa|rina Tritici,</HI> to be lay'd over all, and rolled the Head up again for this Second Dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited in the Evening, and found a quick Pul&s;e, Thir&s;t and <HI>Head-ach;</HI> e&s;pecially toward the Forehead, but no Vomiting. He was very &s;en&s;ible, and indeed bore up beyond Expecta|tion, yet in Con&s;ideration to the Di|&s;turbance we had given to the whole animal Oeconomy, by that Morning's Work, I pre&s;crib'd for him as follows;</P>

<P>The 27th, I vi&s;ited again by my|&s;elf, found the Child &s;omewhat fe|veri&s;h, but without other ill Symptom.</P>
<P>Having his Head &s;upported betwixt the Hands of an Attendant upon the Nur&s;e's Knee, I began to malax the Bandage and Dre&s;&s;ings, (very &s;tiff by rea&s;on of the effu&s;ed Blood) with a little <HI>Ol.

<P>I now could plainly perceive the Extent of the Fracture, which lay all in View, and finding it would be fruitle&s;s to attempt the Reduction of the depre&s;t Bones to their pro|per Places (which were &s;o fa&s;t lock'd in) by any other Means, re&s;olv'd to make Way for &s;etting on the <HI>Trepan.</HI></P>

<P>Having apply'd two or three warm Flannels, and filled up the Cavity with dry Lint, I concluded the be&s;t Part for Trepaning, as likewi&s;e for the Elevator, would be above the Fracture: which being &s;eated on the right <HI>Bregma</HI> was bounded forwards by the <HI>Coronal,</HI> backwards by the <HI>Lamdoide,</HI> upwards by the <HI>Sagittal,</HI> and downwards by the <HI>Squammous Suture.</HI> And indeed &s;o near to this latter (as may be &s;een in the Figure hereto annex'd) that there was not room for the <HI>Trepan</HI> below. When I had therefore drawn a Circle above, within a quarter of an Inch, or le&s;s of the broken Edge, I took out a proportionate Piece of the <HI>Scalp,</HI> al|mo&s;t the Compa&s;s of a mill'd Shil|ling, which my Patient never winch'd
<PB N="10" REF="30">at: altho' he told his Nur&s;e the Day before, he thought at his fir&s;t cut|ting, we would not leave him 'till we had taken off all the Fle&s;h from that Side of his Head. I had now no Occa&s;ion for any Re&s;tringent, &s;o that dre&s;&s;ing up the Bones all dry, I apply'd a large Pledgit of Liniment upon &s;oft Tow over the Lips, and rolled up his Head for that Day.</P>
<P>His Drink, which was indeed his whole Diet, was <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> boil'd together, <HI>Barley-Water, Water|gruel,</HI> and betwixt whiles a &s;mall <HI>Sack Whey.</HI> A Cly&s;ter was repeated al&s;o at this Time, and his <HI>Anodyne</HI> at Night.</P>
<P>This Preparation being made for the Work, I went to Mr. Warden <HI>Herenden,</HI> &s;tated the Ca&s;e, and ap|pointed a Con&s;ultation at Three next Day, after Dinner; de&s;iring he would not fail me; that I might be ju&s;tify'd in the Operation. Accor|dingly, on the 28th, being provided of a good In&s;trument, with a Bore of the &s;malle&s;t Si&s;e, and a &s;uitable <HI>Apparatus</HI> for the Work: At the Hour
<PB N="11" REF="31">appointed he called on me, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">tring my Patient's Chamber, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e found him on his Feet, walking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bout the Room, he &s;eem'd amas'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s ready to &s;urmize the Ca&s;e had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">een mi&s;-&s;tated, and that probably we might &s;pare the Operation. I was not in the lea&s;t concern'd hereat, well knowing he would alter his Sen|timents, upon a Sight of the Wound; and taking off the Dre&s;&s;ings, he &s;eem'd a&s;toni&s;h'd that a Child, under &s;uch a violent Pre&s;&s;ure of that mo&s;t noble Part, (the Source of all the other <HI>Membranes,</HI> if we may tru&s;t a late new Sy&s;tem) from the forcibly intruded Bones, &s;hould labour under no wor&s;e Symptom than a <HI>Head-ach,</HI> and be in a Condition to walk about the Chamber.</P>
<P>Pleas'd with the Child's Courage, he plac'd him again&s;t the Nur&s;e's Bo|&s;om, and took upon him&s;elf to keep his Head &s;teady, whil&s;t I began to work with the <HI>Trepan;</HI> ob&s;erving that admirable Axiom, <HI>Fe&s;tina lente,</HI> I gently turn'd the In&s;trument, now and then taking it up to clean, 'till I had got to the <HI>Diploe:</HI> when lift|ing
<PB N="12" REF="32">it out again, bru&s;hing off the Saw|du&s;t, and laying the Pin a&s;ide, I pro|ceeded to work farther; examining with my Probe betwixt whiles, where I was got thro', and bearing down upon tho&s;e Parts where I found I was not.</P>
<P>In few Minutes the Work was di&s;|patch'd, and being willing to have it out as clear as I could, without ha|ving Occa&s;ion to &s;hiver off any Part that might remain undivided by the Saw, I thought to pa&s;s gently a Turn more upon the adhering Side, and &s;o remove my In&s;trument; when at fir&s;t &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd, we mis'd the perforated Bone, and were ready to &s;urmi&s;e, the <HI>Membrane</HI> being &s;ome|where lacerated underneath, had let it in, and return'd by its own pro|per Ela&s;ticity again to its Convexity; but looking into the In&s;trument we found it in the Bore. I hint this as a Memoir for the young Arti&s;t: for 'twas not truly my Intention to have taken it &s;o out: Nor did I &s;u&s;pect, that one gentle Turn, would have cut a&s;under that Part which ju&s;t before

<P>The <HI>Warden</HI> was pleas'd however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ith the Operation, the Edges of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">one were &s;o exactly &s;mooth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ven, that we needed no Lenticular to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ome after, for to poli&s;h the Work. The <HI>Dura Mater</HI> appear'd fair, tho' &s;omewhat &s;torid from its Inflamati|on: And now we immediately &s;et about the lifting up the depre&s;t Bones; in order to which pa&s;&s;ing carefully my Elevator thro' the Perforation, and heedfully ob&s;erving that the <HI>Mem|brane</HI> might not &s;lip between my In|&s;trument, and the fractur'd Bone I was about to rai&s;e; I began to lift, having placed the End of the &s;aid In|&s;trument under the Center of the lar|ge&s;t and mo&s;t likely of them; when bearing up with con&s;iderable Force, I found it would not &s;tir: on which Account I drew back my Elevator, and arming its Shank with a &s;oft Rag, placed al&s;o a linnen Bol&s;ter upon that Part of the Edge of the &s;ound <HI>Cra|nium,</HI> which was to be its <HI>Fulcrum.</HI></P>
<PB N="14" REF="34">
<P>Being thus provided, I convey'd it in once more, and with redoubled Force perceived it began to give; con|tinuing the &s;ame Force, it immedi|ately flew up, and &s;hiver'd off the inner Table.</P>
<P>This Bone extracted, our Work was much facilitated, nor had we farther Occa&s;ion to pa&s;s our In&s;trument thro' the Bore; for by &s;hifting our <HI>Ful|crum,</HI> or re&s;ting upon another Part we could command the other Peices at our Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>There had been a Debate the Day before, betwixt Mr. <HI>B</HI> &mdash; and my &s;elf, whether after extracting one or two of the Bones, we &s;hould not leave the Remainder, having rai&s;ed them up to their Places, in expectation that they might agglutinate, or unite by Inter|vention of a <HI>Callus;</HI> by which the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> would be defended from lying bare &s;o large a Compa&s;s, and our Work &s;horten'd, in re&s;pect to the Cure, if &s;uch a thing might be accom|pli&s;h'd. However finding them all break upon their Elevation, and fear|ing &s;ome loo&s;e Angles might irritate

<P>Having remov'd the&s;e four Peices of Bones, of the exact Shape and Di|men&s;ion with tho&s;e expre&s;s'd in the annex'd Scheme, the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> be|gan to vibrate &s;trongly, and rai&s;ed it &s;elf at the &s;ame In&s;tant, to fill up the &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>Cha&s;m;</HI> which wiping gently with a Piece of a &s;oft Sponge wrung out of a little warm Claret, I pre&s;ently co|ver'd that and the bored Part, with &s;uitable Syndons of white Sar&s;net, dipt only in <HI>Mel Ro&s;arum,</HI> continu|ing my dry Lint upon the Lips, and having laid the Dige&s;tive over all, I rolled up his Head.</P>
<P>After the Work was over, he was carry'd to Bed, being refre&s;h'd with two or three Spoonfulls of his <HI>Cepha|lic</HI> Julep.</P>
<P>From this Day our Work &s;eeming|ly went on with a pro&s;perous A&s;pect; the <HI>Cephalalgye</HI> much abated, the Pul&s;e grew calm and the Child lively; &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="36">continuing for Four or Five Days. The <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> both in the Place of the Perforation, as well as that where the Bones had been extracted, began to be be&s;prinked with little Grains of Fle&s;h, only in the mid&s;t of this lat|ter, there appear'd a kind of Slough, occa&s;ion'd by the Points of the de|pre&s;t Bones, which by grating hard had ras'd the outward <HI>Membrane;</HI> to dige&s;t and ha&s;ten Separation of which, I dre&s;s'd tho&s;e Parts with a little of the <HI>Bal&s;am. Terebinth.</HI> added to the <HI>Mel Ro&s;arum.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this Part mundify'd, and a Sort of granulated Fle&s;h had cloathed the bare <HI>Membrane:</HI> but our <HI>Head-ach</HI> return'd afre&s;h with greater Extremity than ever, the <HI>Symptoma|tic Fever</HI> and Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s al&s;o accom|pany'd; &s;o that on the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> about Five Days after the Operation, upon taking off the Bandage, I per|ceiv'd there had been a much greater Di&s;charge than could be rea&s;onably expected from the out&s;ide Wounds; and removing the Dre&s;&s;ings, to ap|ply a <HI>Stuph</HI> wrung out of the Fomen|tation,
<PB N="17" REF="37">took notice of an offen&s;ive Smell, when looking carefully upon the <HI>Membrane,</HI> thoro' a &s;mall <HI>Pa|pilla,</HI> or Grain of the new incarned Fle&s;h, where the Slough had thrown off, there ouzed out a faetid Matter from underneath.</P>
<P>Believing the Ca&s;e to be de&s;perate, I armed a &s;mall Pledgit with <HI>Linim. Arcaei.</HI> dipping the &s;ame in the 'fore|&s;aid Mixture of <HI>Mel. Ro&s;.</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;.

<P>The next Day intending to make Apertion thro' the <HI>Meninx,</HI> and re|lieve the <HI>Brain</HI> of the fluctuating Mat|ter, I acquainted Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;, told him what I had di&s;cover'd, and the Nece&s;|&s;ity of our farther proceeding.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 6. we met in Con&s;ultation,
<PB N="18" REF="38">where we found the Matter &s;omewhat le&s;&s;en'd in its Di&s;charge, tho' &s;till abundantly too much. The Lips which, the Day before were fallen, looking white and flabby, and the in|carn'd <HI>Granules</HI> of Fle&s;h, upon the <HI>Membrane</HI> which were then &s;inking and of the &s;ame Colour, had now as it were reviv'd, and put on a fre&s;h Complexion; nor could we perceive the lea&s;t Drop of Matter, bur&s;ting thro' in any Part of the <HI>Membrane,</HI> or any room for a Probe, where I had remark'd it ouzing forth.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Considerations, tho' the Symptoms &s;till kept up, without Re|mi&s;&s;ion, I mean the <HI>Fever, Watching,</HI> and <HI>Headach,</HI> yet Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash; &s;ur|mi&s;ing I might be mi&s;taken in my ye|&s;terdays Remark, or hoping the Mat|ter (lodging only betwixt the <HI>Dupli|cature</HI>) had made its <HI>Exit:</HI> per&s;waded me to dre&s;s up, and endeavour to re|lieve the Child &s;ome other way; to which Purpo&s;e, upon further Con&s;ul|tation, it was agreed, that I &s;hould pre&s;ently open the <HI>Jugular</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ide, out of which running briskly, and in a full Stream, we drew Six Ounces
<PB N="19" REF="39">of Blood. A <HI>Ve&s;icatory</HI> was al&s;o ap|ply'd to the Neck, and an <HI>Emollient</HI> Cly&s;ter thrown up in the Evening. The <HI>Anti-epileptic</HI> Powders were repea|ted, with the Addition of two Grains of <HI>Sal Vol. C. C.</HI> to each Paper: The <HI>Cephalic Julep ut antea.</HI> and if the <HI>Head|ach</HI> did not remit by the next Day, Leaches were concluded to be &s;et be|hind the Ears, as al&s;o to each Temple.</P>
<P>The 7th, I call'd again, and under|&s;tood by the Nur&s;e the Child had a bad Night; was then hot and re&s;tle&s;s, and cry'd out of his Head.</P>
<P>This Afternoon I took off the Dre&s;|&s;ings, perceiv'd the Bandage and Com|pre&s;s were fouled with the Matter, likewi&s;e the Pillow he had lain on, which confirm'd my beleif that it was highly rational to make an Aperti|on thro' the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> and that without &s;o doing, all other Endea|vours would prove u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The Dre&s;&s;ings taken off, I plainly ob&s;erv'd from whence the Matter had come forth, but could not find a Pa&s;|&s;age for my Probe, altho there was a &s;mall Drop of Matter in the Mouth of
<PB N="20" REF="40">the <HI>Papillary Excre&s;cens,</HI> the &s;uppo&s;ed Place of its Vent. There being no Arti&s;t by to ju&s;tify my Proceeding, I dre&s;t up again as before, the <HI>Warden</HI> having promis'd to meet me on the 8th, du|ring which Interval, &s;o great a Quan|tity of the purulent Matter bad workt out, as to afford &s;ome Relief to the <HI>Brain,</HI> &s;o that the Symptoms grew milder: He try'd at this Dre&s;&s;ing with his Probe, but could find no Entrance: The Wound lookt fre&s;h, and the In|carning ruddy, tho' not much en|creas'd for 3 or 4 Days pa&s;t. However, (much contrary to my own Sentiments) I was again prevail'd upon to dre&s;s up, continuing my wonted Applica|tions, and to wait a little longer, to &s;ee what farther Time might produce, unle&s;s fre&s;h Symptoms call'd for a Penetration, of which I was to give notice.</P>
<P>Thus we continu'd to the 15th, the Pain 'twixt whiles remitting and returning, a &s;tinking Gleet with much Matter upon our Dre&s;&s;ings: One Day we &s;eemed to get Ground, but the next lo&s;t it. The Lips again grew
<PB N="21" REF="41">flaccid, and the Fle&s;h upon the <HI>Mem|brane</HI> loo&s;e and pallid; &s;o that, re|&s;olving to wait no longer, I went again to Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash; and told him I &s;hould lo&s;e my little Patient, if he would not comply with my dividing the <HI>Membrane:</HI> He readily offer'd me his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and came according to his Appointment.</P>
<P>When we came into the Chamber, the Child was crying very dolefully of his Head: There was a fae|tid Smell by the Bed&s;ide, from the putrid <HI>Effluvia,</HI> ari&s;ing from the pent up Matter: And tho' we were &s;en&s;i|ble there was far too great a Quan|tity to proceed from the Wound, yet could we not, even at this Dre&s;|&s;ing, di&s;cover the Orifice that had let it out. The <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI> and <HI>Dia&s;tole</HI> of the <HI>Membrane</HI> likewi&s;e hindring us, from apprehending any Fluctuation under our Fingers: So that I cannot any ways blame, nor would I reflect by any Means upon that Gentleman's Judgment and great Caution in this Affair; he having never &s;een the Mat|ter ari&s;ing out of the incarned Fle&s;h,
<PB N="22" REF="42">as I had done, and might think, per|haps, I was therein deceiv'd.</P>
<P>I was at this Time extreamly un|willing to dre&s;s again, 'till I had gi|ven a freer Vent: and attempted the Search once more with my Probe, yet &s;till without Succe&s;s: At la&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing hard down upon one Side of the &s;trongly re&s;iliating <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> a &s;mall Drop of Matter blubber'd out of the afore&s;aid <HI>Papilla,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Warden</HI> perceiving, immediately took out a fine Probe from his Box, and pre&s;&s;ing gently down, got in; very readi|ly giving Way to make an Apertion: whil&s;t his Probe which he bore up un|derneath, was to guide my Lancet: with which Direction I pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame in, and made a Wound about a Quar|ter of an Inch in Length; when exa|mining more narrowly with the Probe, we found (having not the Di&s;charge we expected) that it was got betwixt the Duplicature of the <HI>Membrane;</HI> &s;o that without Delay, examining again, he &s;oon got under to the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> when rai&s;ing up the Part as before with his Probe, I cut clo&s;e to the
<PB N="23" REF="43">Side thereof, 'till I had made a Wound of half an Inch, by which we di&s;|charg'd a va&s;t Quantity of &s;tinking <HI>Pus,</HI> inter&s;pers'd with two or three &s;mall Globules of the <HI>Cortex</HI> of the <HI>Brain.</HI></P>
<P>By this la&s;t Inci&s;ion, we were put to a Dilemma: a &s;mall <HI>Capillary Artery</HI> being divided in the inmo&s;t Coat of this <HI>Membrane.</HI> Here was no Place for biting <HI>Stiptics,</HI> nor indeed for the common Re&s;tringents; &s;ome Part of which, with the utmo&s;t Care, mu&s;t in|evitably fall in upon the <HI>Brain,</HI> and there produce very bad Effects, if not the mo&s;t direful Symptoms: Nor was there, by any re&s;i&s;ting Body under|neath, any hope that by Compre&s;&s;ion, we could &s;tay the Flux.</P>
<P>The Moment of its &s;purting up, Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash; with an armed Probe pre&s;t clo&s;e upon the Mouth thereof, which did me double Service, by re&s;training its Bleeding and dilating the Wound, whil&s;t I conveyed a Do&s;&s;il ty'd round with Thread, who&s;e End hung out for the &s;ecure Extraction, dipt in the above-mentioned <HI>Mel Ro&s;arum,</HI> into
<PB N="24" REF="44">a &s;mall Quantity of which, for cor|recting the Stench and Putrifaction, I had before-hand in&s;tilled a few Drops of a <HI>Tinct: Myrh:</HI> drawn in White|wine. Clapping this down &s;oftly upon the tender <HI>Meninx,</HI> or rather upon the <HI>Brain</HI> it &s;elf, the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> being here eroded, and having made up a &s;econd Do&s;&s;il &s;omewhat tighter, and fitted to the Dimen&s;ions of the Wound, ty'd likewi&s;e with a Thread as the other: whil&s;t he took away his armed Probe, I clap'd it clo&s;e upon the wounded Ve&s;&s;el, which being but <HI>Capillary,</HI> we were in Hopes would be &s;oon choak'd by this kind of Com|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Being dre&s;s'd up, he was carry'd to his Bed, Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash; acquainting the Parents, that his Ca&s;e was truly doubt|ful, if not de&s;perate ab&s;olutely: and I my &s;elf indeed believing, I &s;hould not often dre&s;s him after.

<PB N="25" REF="45">the&s;e little Innocents: I re&s;olv'd to leave nothing unattempted, ju&s;tifyable by Art, for this little Champion's Re|covery.</P>
<P>Having no more to do at pre&s;ent, we took our Leaves, when I had fir&s;t (for his Refre&s;hment) pre&s;crib'd the following <HI>Julep.</HI></P>

<P>The next Day after opening the <HI>Membrane,</HI> the <HI>Fever</HI> and <HI>Head-ach</HI> did again remit, our Patient was mani|fe&s;tly reliev'd: And what is a remar|kable In&s;tance of the Truth of that grand Phy&s;ical Axiom, <HI>Natura e&s;t &s;ui Con&s;ervatrix:</HI> we could perceive the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> plainly to do the Office of a Pump, throwing off at every <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="46">a large Quantity of the offen&s;ive Mat|ter, together with &s;everal con&s;iderable <HI>Thrombi</HI> of the grumous Blood, which had been effus'd from the bleeding Artery, and fallen inwardly upon the <HI>Brain.</HI></P>
<P>At this Dre&s;&s;ing likewi&s;e I appre|hended &s;ome &s;mall Particles of the <HI>Brain,</HI> mixed with the Matter and Blood afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Thus we continued on the mend|ing Hand: So that in few Days more our little Patient began to call for his Play-Fellows, and walk'd &s;turdily a|bout the Chamber. The Matter dai|ly le&s;&s;en'd, grew perfectly &s;weet and well concocted: altho' &s;till &s;ome Quan|tity thereof (upon Removal of the Dre&s;&s;ings) we could di&s;cern to be lifted out by the Vibration of the <HI>Membrane,</HI> who&s;e proper Elater (as I ju&s;t now hint|ed) well &s;upply'd the Place of the <HI>Antlia</HI> or Sucker in the Pump or Syringe, ca&s;t|ing off the offending Matter, &s;o far as lay within the Spheer of its Activity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Applications were &s;till continu'd leaving out the <HI>Tinct. Myrh.</HI> and putting in daily a &s;oft

Ro&s;.</HI> unle&s;s a &s;mall Pledgit upon the wounded Part of it: u&s;ing nothing but dry Lint, which however de&s;picable, is &s;urely the be&s;t of Dre&s;|&s;ings at the&s;e Times, by which and a &s;light Touch of the <HI>Vitriol</HI> Stone, I kept off the luxuriant Fle&s;h (at &s;ome|times trouble&s;ome, when improperly treated) and di&s;po&s;ed the Edges of the Bones for De&s;quamation, which in Seven Weeks Time was accompli&s;h'd: A &s;mall Part only, and that upon one Side, exfoliating vi&s;ibly.</P>
<P>By the 10th of <HI>May,</HI> our incarned Fle&s;h grew callous, the Pul&s;ation un|derneath but little perceptible, and a &s;ound <HI>Cicatrix</HI> brought over to the very Edge of the Apertion, which had been made upon the <HI>Dura Mater;</HI> and thro' which we had
<PB N="28" REF="48">&s;till a Di&s;charge of laudable <HI>Pus,</HI> tho' incon&s;iderable to what it had been.</P>
<P>We kept him all this while to his fir&s;t Allowance of <HI>Water-gruel, Pana|do, Barley-gruel, Milk, Pottage;</HI> his Drink chiefly <HI>Milk</HI> boil'd with Wa|ter; but growing brisk, and playing about as cheerfully as ever, when he had been purged two or three times with <HI>Manna,</HI> he had the Liberty of a more free and airy Chamber, and in|deed tre&s;pa&s;s'd &s;o far as to get down Stairs, to eat (tho' &s;paringly) fre&s;h Meat every other Day; and could not be re&s;trained from all his u&s;ual Exerci&s;es and Diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s now was to contrive the keeping open the Wound I had made in the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> which was ready to clo&s;e upon us, tho' of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to be kept there|from, whil&s;t there was any Matter to be dreined off.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B</HI> &mdash; being got abroad, was ea&s;ily prevail'd upon to give us a Vi|&s;it, and having in&s;pected the Work, pa&s;&s;ed in his Probe down to the <HI>Pia Mater.</HI> but finding no &s;lanting <HI>Sinus,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="49">on1y a direct one to the <HI>Brain,</HI> concluded there was no dilating; for indeed, where could we cut, unle&s;s upon this lower <HI>Meninx,</HI> or into the <HI>Brain</HI> it &s;elf. Our Work was all in the dark: Nor could we know the Source of the Matter, daily di&s;charging in &s;mall Quantity; &s;o that all we could do, was to prevent the Coalition of the Wound, hoping that in Time the &s;aid Matter might be clean&s;ed off, or in|&s;inuate it &s;elf up higher into the ad|ventitious Body that was there formed from the Ve&s;&s;els and <HI>Membranes</HI> cir|cumjacent, when we might with more Safety enlarge, and give a freer Vent.</P>
<P>For keeping the Wound open, which was the more difficult in Con|&s;ideration of the Part, I propo&s;ed a little <HI>Cannula,</HI> but he rather preferr'd a Bit of Sponge Tent, which he thought would not only lye much ea|&s;ier, but imbibing the Matter, di&s;|charge it at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>With this I comply'd, and put in a &s;mall Peice, fa&s;ten'd about with a String on the upper Part.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="50">
<P>Next Day, when I came to open the Wound, I found the Matter (as I fear'd) was entirely pent in; nor had one Drop of it pa&s;&s;ed either by the Sides, or thro' the Pores of the Sponge; but drawing the &s;ame forth by the Thread, a con&s;iderable Quantity (col|lected in the Twenty Four Hours pa&s;t) gu&s;ht forth, and continued to be thrown off by the <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI> of the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> 'till it had empty'd the Cavi|ty of all it could lift up.</P>
<P>The Orifice being now enlarged by the Tent: I apply'd a &s;mall Pledgit of Liniment on the out&s;ide; having before-hand dropped in with a Fea|ther, a Drop or two of <HI>Mel Ro&s;.</HI> and ob&s;erved this Way of Dre&s;&s;ing, &s;till breaking a&s;under the uniting Fibres, with my Probe, where they were rea|dy to coale&s;ce; and dipping its End in Oyl, be&s;mear'd the Lips of the Wound, by which Means the Matter which became now again incon&s;idera|ble, made its Way without Ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>And thus we continu'd to the mid|dle of <HI>May;</HI> our young Gentleman growing fle&s;hy, and enjoying a bet|ter
<PB N="31" REF="51">State of Health than he had done &s;ome Years before.</P>
<P>About this Time, meeting my Neigh|bour Dr. <HI>Morton,</HI> and my Brother <HI>Blundel,</HI> in Con&s;ultation at another Place; and pa&s;&s;ing by my Patient's Hou&s;e, I invited them to walk in, where they &s;aw him dre&s;s'd, and took a View of the extracted Bones. Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash; had the Curio&s;ity again to ex|amine the Wound, and having the Probe &s;treight down for about half an Inch, di&s;covered a &s;lanting <HI>Sinus,</HI> not before ob&s;erv'd, as very likely but lately made: when drawing it forth, to bend the End, he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame in again, and lifting up the Ex|tremity, we could perceive it near an Inch di&s;tant from the Place it enter'd.</P>
<P>Having made this Di&s;covery, I re|&s;olved, if the Di&s;charge continued much longer, or any Symptom re|turn'd, to cut into this Cavity: For I had taken Notice that &s;everal of our late Dre&s;&s;ings had been di&s;turbed from the Child's Scratching: In&s;omuch that altho' the &s;ame Bandage was all along continued, yet by the Di&s;tur|bance
<PB N="32" REF="52">from breeding of Lice, from Dandrif, or Humour under the <HI>Cuti|cle</HI> &s;ome one or all the&s;e Cau&s;es, there grew &s;o trouble&s;ome an Irching, that in the Night he had got all off: The Wound was upon clo&s;ing, and a dry cru&s;ty Scurf, or caked Matter had choaked up the Orifice.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day the By-&s;tanders had ob&s;erv'd a Sort of Rigour had &s;eiz'd him, which went off in a Moment. Whil&s;t I was dre&s;&s;ing him next Day, I perceiv'd &s;omewhat of that Kind, and asked him what he ailed, he reply'd briskly enough, he could not tell, nor could he help it.</P>
<P>The Wound was again open'd by the <HI>Dige&s;tive</HI> I had apply'd the Day before; and the &s;cabby Cru&s;t ca&s;t off, with a &s;mall Quantity of Matter as u&s;ual. To prevent the like Inconve|nience of rubbing off his Dre&s;&s;ings, I laid over my Pledgit a more adhe|&s;ive Empla&s;ter, clipt the Hair clo&s;e, and rolling up his Head, carefully cau|tion'd him to keep his Hands off.</P>
<P>I was very much concerned at the&s;e Rigours, and fearfull le&s;t the Matter
<PB N="33" REF="53">&s;hould have got into the Blood, or tainted the Nerves, by in&s;inuating it &s;elf thro' the Cortical Part of the <HI>Brain:</HI> but did not expect the Sur|prize &s;o &s;udden; for early the next Morning I was alarmed with the News, that the Child was &s;eized with a violent <HI>Convul&s;ion.</HI> I ha&s;ten'd, and found him &s;en&s;ele&s;s, very &s;trongly twitcht on the contrary Side: The <HI>Tendons</HI> of that Arm and Leg e&s;peci|ally, perpetually relaxing and again contracting: Upon which, 'till they thought fit to &s;end for a Phy&s;ician, I pre&s;cribed thus to their <HI>Apothecary.</HI></P>

<P>In the Evening I return'd again, found the Child &s;en&s;ible: his Fits had been off and on, at two or three Hours Di&s;tance: He then complain'd of being &s;ick, and retcht to vomit; his <HI>Head-ach</HI> al&s;o was very trouble|&s;ome.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 18th, which was the Day after the&s;e <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> I undre&s;t his Head, and found all things had an ill A&s;pect: The Wound was indige&s;ted, the Lips puffed up, and ri&s;en to a con|&s;iderable Heighth above the re&s;t of the Parts, di&s;charging only a bloody <HI>Se|rum.</HI></P>
<P>I fomented again as I had done thro' the whole Cour&s;e of my Atten|dance, ordering each Time the <HI>Fotus</HI> was taken from the Fire, two Spoonfulls of the <HI>Aq.

At this Time I ob&s;erv'd a <HI>Lypothumia,</HI> on which Account, I ha&s;ten'd them to
<PB N="37" REF="57">lay him down in his Bed, admini&s;tring &s;ome Drops of the <HI>Sp. Lavend.</HI> in a little of the <HI>Julep.</HI></P>
<P>He continu'd &s;en&s;ible all that Day, &s;till crying out of his Head, but at Night was delirous at &s;ome Times.</P>
<P>The next Day I perceiv'd the Wound was crude &s;till, and no Sign of Mat|ter: The turgid Lips turning livid, and a very languid O&s;cillation underneath. The whole <HI>Membrane,</HI> &s;o far as had been bare, to the very Edges of the fractur'd <HI>Cranium,</HI> was &s;tangely huft up or elevated.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed my Probe down cautiou&s;ly upon the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> and could feel all round, a pappy <HI>Excre&s;cens,</HI> which had incarn'd upon the lower <HI>Mem|brane,</HI> or was formed together with the upper and the adjacent Ve&s;&s;els, from whence aro&s;e (upon drawing back my In&s;trument) a &s;mall Quantity of Matter.</P>
<P>I now ventur'd to drop in a little of my <HI>Bal&s;. Terebinth.</HI> to the Bottom of the Wound, and as to the re&s;t made up as the Day before</P>
<PB N="38" REF="58">
<P><HI>May</HI> the 20th, he grew <HI>comato&s;e,</HI> crying faintly now and then, his Head, and dropt a&s;leep. That Night his <HI>Spa&s;ms</HI> return'd, with which the <HI>Paralytic</HI> Arm was chiefly and &s;evere|ly handled, The Wound tending to gangreen: which I &s;carrify'd, &s;nipping off &s;ome Part of the Lips at the &s;ame Time, but had little or no Blood fol|lowing either my Sci&s;&s;ars or Lancet.</P>
<P>Seeing now no Advantage to be gained, but only Di&s;turbance to the Child, I dre&s;t him for that Time, with a &s;omewhat warmer Application, on Account of the Gangreen; conclu|ding to give neither my &s;elf, nor him, any more Trouble.</P>
<P>That Day and next the <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> were &s;eldom off; and when they were, he was perfectly &s;tupid: Some|times indeed he would attempt to &s;peak, but could not.</P>
<P>However, on the 22d, finding him &s;till alive, I thought it would be deem|ed an Omi&s;&s;ion, if I did not in&s;pect his Wound: And as he lay along, I took off the Dre&s;&s;ings, found the Lips flabby and &s;ub&s;iding, &s;o far from ap|pearing
<PB N="39" REF="59">to dige&s;t, that every thing tended to a &s;uddenly approaching Death. Having cover'd up his Head again, I took my Leave.</P>
<P>The next Day, which was the 23d of <HI>May,</HI> I had Notice given me, he was dead.</P>
<P>Thus did this little <HI>Hero,</HI> of truly Manly Courage, who had &s;truggled under, and got thro' &s;o many Difficul|ties, and &s;eemed now in vulgar E&s;ti|mation, to have been well and out of danger for a long Time pa&s;t, at la&s;t de|cea&s;e, after Four&s;core and Four Days. And indeed had there been nothing more than the Fracture and Depre&s;&s;ion (how de&s;perate &s;oever they might &s;eem) yet his Cure had been com|pleated in a much &s;horter Time. But con&s;idering the large Ab&s;ce&s;s upon the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> its Rupture or Ero&s;ion, from whence there i&s;&s;ued (as Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash; can te&s;tifie) &s;ome of the outward Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Brain,</HI> 'twas little Wonder <HI>Nature</HI> &s;hould &s;uccumb and baffle <HI>Art:</HI> But very &s;urpri&s;ing, that for three Months Time, whil&s;t Mat|ter lay upon this noble Part, nei|ther

<P>I am very confident, I &s;hould not have magnify'd my own Judgment, had I &s;ucceeded in this Cure, which the Gentleman afore&s;aid was pleas'd to allow would have been one of the greate&s;t had been perform'd in <HI>England;</HI> and if &s;o, I think I may &s;ay, <HI>El&s;ewhere.</HI> As it was, I thought there would intervene &s;omewhat worthy of Remark; and accordingly (as I ge|nerally do of rare Ca&s;es) I made this <HI>Ephemeris;</HI> which if it &s;hould not furni&s;h Matter of In&s;truction, as I hope it may, to my younger Bro|ther; yet will it let him &s;ee, how near he may come to the Accompli&s;h|ment of his Work, and at la&s;t meet with Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>The Day after his Death, I took with me a &s;mall Capital Saw, and a
<PB N="41" REF="61">di&s;&s;ecting Knife, and placing the Head to my Advantage, I divided the <HI>Scalp</HI> from the Ba&s;e of the <HI>Occiput,</HI> clo&s;e by the <HI>Sagittal Suture,</HI> to the Top of the Forehead; then turning it down, together with the <HI>Temporal Mu&s;cle,</HI> which I rai&s;ed at the &s;ame Time, over the Ear of the wounded Side of the Head: With the back of my Knife I clear'd off the <HI>Pericranium:</HI> And with my Saw, (guided by a Line of Ink I had drawn before-hand, on the Top as well as on that Side,) I got thro' the <HI>Skull;</HI> which being remov'd with the End of my <HI>Spathula,</HI> the right Hemi&s;phere of the <HI>Brain,</HI> I found would come into View, by only clip|ping off the <HI>Dura Mater.</HI> But before I began to meddle with this latter, having rais'd up the Side of the <HI>Skull,</HI> I took &s;pecial Notice of that Part of the <HI>Membrane</HI> which I had formerly divided or cut into, and of the &s;ub|jacent <HI>Pia Mater</HI> and <HI>Cerebrum.</HI></P>
<P>I perceiv'd there had been ingen|dred a fibrous Sub&s;tance, but whether &s;pringing from the tender <HI>Meninx,</HI> or complicated together of both <HI>Mem|branes</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="62">and Ve&s;&s;els, was not &s;o ea&s;ie to determine. Two or three Days before, it &s;eem'd to be an Inch thick, but after Death, growing flabby, it parted upon the lea&s;t Touch, and was fallen off from the upper <HI>Membrane,</HI> tho' here and there continuous with the under one.</P>
<P>When I had remov'd this interpo|&s;ing Body, I expected to find &s;ome la|tent Ab&s;ce&s;s upon the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Brain,</HI> at lea&s;t upon the <HI>Pia Mater:</HI> Where all that was con&s;picuous (an Indication there had been &s;uch) were the larger Ramifications of the San|guiferous Ve&s;&s;els, upon the Surface of the <HI>Membrane,</HI> who&s;e Cavities, in&s;tead of their naturally contained <HI>Cruor,</HI> were implete with a tran&s;parent <HI>Pus:</HI> More e&s;pecially tho&s;e upon the ante|rior <HI>Lobe,</HI> under the <HI>Os Frontis,</HI> where the <HI>Head-ach</HI> was at fir&s;t, as well as at the la&s;t, continually pointed to.</P>
<P>Cutting into the Cortical Part of the <HI>Brain,</HI> I found all free and clear, as in a &s;ound State: The <HI>Ventricles</HI> like|wi&s;e, the <HI>Oblong Marrow,</HI> al&s;o the
<PB N="43" REF="63"><HI>Cerebell</HI> were firm, and to the Eye un|tainted.</P>
<P>Being now minded to take a View of the other Side, I divided the <HI>Falx,</HI> and (without &s;awing off that Part of the <HI>Cranium</HI>) with my Hand, brought out the left <HI>Hemi&s;pheer:</HI> The Ve&s;&s;els on who&s;e Surface, in like Manner with the right, were con&s;picuou&s;ly turgid with the &s;ame Matter, a little of which, here and there, was &s;hed upon the <HI>Cortex</HI> of the <HI>Brain:</HI> At the fir&s;t Sight, I thought it might lie on the Out&s;ide of the <HI>Pia Mater;</HI> but going over gently with the Back of my Knife, and wiping al&s;o with a &s;oft Sponge, I found it not removed: So that in &s;everal Places, opening the <HI>Membrane</HI> with the Point of my Lancet, I per|ceiv'd it lay immediately upon the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Brain,</HI> and i&s;&s;ued out thro' each Apertion.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;atisfy'd my own Curio&s;ity, I placed the <HI>Brain</HI> where I found it, and fitting to, the divided <HI>Skull,</HI> drew over the <HI>Scalp:</HI> which &s;titching up, and with the Point of my Needle rai&s;ingthe &s;hort Hair, to cover
<PB N="44" REF="64">the &s;aid Stiches: 'Twas no ea&s;ie Matter for the nice&s;t Surveyor, to perceive that the <HI>Brain</HI> had been taken out and in&s;pected, or the <HI>Cranium</HI> med|dled with: But this only by the bye.</P>
<P>It may be now expected, I &s;hould de&s;cend to the <HI>AEtiologye,</HI> and ratio|nally &s;olve, or mechanically explain the foregoing <HI>Phaenomena:</HI> But as to this, I think I may as well in gene|ral confe&s;s my Ignorance, as pretend to unfold that, for another Per&s;on's, which I never could elucidate to my own Satisfaction.</P>
<P>'Till the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Sen&s;ation is bet|ter unravell'd, than hitherto it hath been, or I fear will be; die Di&s;or|ders of the <HI>Nervous Sy&s;tem</HI> may be con|jectur'd, but not clearly demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>Whither there be any &s;uch Bodies as the Animal Spirits, is not yet univer|&s;ally agreed on: That the Source of the&s;e Di&s;orders lies &s;omewhere in the <GAP DESC="foreign">, and that the Nervous Bodies, thence ari&s;ing, are &s;ome how or other the <HI>Cau&s;ae &s;ine qua,</HI> of Motion and Per|ception, &s;eems inconte&s;table. Thus far we may go, and trace out many Appea|rances:
<PB N="45" REF="65">Thus al&s;o from the bare Mo|tion of the Particles of Matter, as they happen to be this or that Way modi|fy'd, may we by <HI>Mechanic</HI> Laws ac|count for &s;undry Ob&s;ervables in the Animal Structure: But how meer Mat|ter, which Way &s;oever figur'd, can at fir&s;t give, guide, and govern the <HI>Impetus</HI> is unaccountable. 'Tis here that the poor. Twilight of Humane Under&s;tanding is truly nonplu&s;t. And what we argue mu&s;t be &s;till <HI>a po&s;terio|ri:</HI> We may judge, having afore|hand di&s;covered the Effect produc'd, that the like under &s;imilar Circum&s;tan|ces, will be brought forth again: Thus, the <HI>Quod &s;it,</HI> is apparent, but the <HI>Quo|modo,</HI> out of Sight.</P>
<P>'Tis manife&s;t the Blow upon our little Patient's Head, was the remote Cau&s;e of his Death, by occa&s;ioning a Rupture of &s;ome of the Ve&s;&s;els upon the <HI>Brain,</HI> which &s;hedding forth their Blood upon this noble Part, did there (being not di&s;charg'd) produce an <HI>Apo&s;teme:</HI> And when the purulent Matter, was, afterwards, imbibed or ab&s;orbed by &s;ome of the &s;aid
<PB N="46" REF="66">Ve&s;&s;els; it might in the Way of Cir|culation, rai&s;e a <HI>Febrile Efferve&s;cence:</HI> And 'tis very rational to believe, that the &s;ame Matter al&s;o did impre&s;s a Taint upon the Nerves, exciting to|gether an <HI>Orga&s;mus,</HI> to the Subver&s;i|on of the whole Oeconomy.</P>
<P>But what the&s;e putrid Bodies are, which did the Mi&s;chief, or in what their E&s;&s;ence does con&s;i&s;t, how, or after what Manner, and why they came chiefly to affect the Arm on the contrary Side, how after a few Mi|nutes they brought on a <HI>Paraly&s;is,</HI> or how the Nervous <HI>Fibres</HI> with the <HI>Tendons</HI> of the <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> in that Arm and Leg, came &s;o regularly and al|ternately to be haled by the direful <HI>Spa&s;ms,</HI> is what I know little or no|thing of.</P>
<P>'Tis true, I might make &s;ome Noi&s;e, and talk of venomous Exhalations, or malign and poi&s;onous <HI>Mia&s;mata,</HI> which in&s;inuating into the <HI>Fibres,</HI> like &s;o many <HI>Stimuli,</HI> mu&s;t needs twitch and convell tho&s;e exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible, the Nervous Bodies. With &s;ome I might denominate them <HI>Acids:</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="67">With others, <HI>Atkelyes:</HI> Or with our curious <HI>Mathematical</HI> Gentlemen, I might e&s;&s;ay to inve&s;tigate the Confi|guration of their Parts, whether <HI>Cubes, Cones, Pri&s;ms,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o let you into the Way of their Operation up|on the Animal Spirits, or the Nervous <HI>Filaments:</HI> And when I had gone thus far, a judiciou&s;ly learned Man would &s;ee I had harrangu'd to very little Purpo&s;e: And that I might as well have own'd, it was &s;ome how or other the Effect was brought about, but which Way I could not tell.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Adept</HI> in <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> here &s;trut and pride him&s;elf in his Recour&s;e to a Mundane Soul, or his Omnipotent Nature: Let him take up with tho&s;e unintelligible Terms of his <HI>Archaeus,</HI> or his Pla&s;tic Powers, whil&s;t I, who never yet &s;hook off the Sacred Ties of Religion, and am &s;elf con&s;cious how great a Debtor I am to His Munificence, look up to the prime Architect, the great <GAP DESC="foreign">, and cor|dially, as well as orally, acknowledge, that it was HE that made me, and not I my &s;elf, that Man is fearfully

<DIV2 TYPE="corollary">
<HEAD>Some Inferences by Way of <HI>Corollary,</HI> from the pre|ceeding Di&s;cour&s;e.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THAT Wounds into the <HI>Brain,</HI> are not always Mortal.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;o far as the <HI>Pia Mater</HI> cir|cumvolves, or enters into the Gyra|tions of the Cortical Part, there is a <HI>Medium</HI> of Unition, or a <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> to in|carn upon: So that altho' this Part of the <HI>Brain</HI> be &s;hed, the &s;ick or wounded may recover: Nay that al|tho' great Portions of the &s;ame work out, we mu&s;t nor de&s;perately for&s;ake
<PB N="53" REF="73">the Patient, &s;ince the &s;hatter'd Edges of this <HI>Membrane</HI> may fortunately (however unexpectedly) concide and coale&s;ce, to prevent the farther Erup|tion, and afford the &s;aid <HI>Medium</HI> to incarn upon. This conceded, it fol|lows,</P>
<P N="3">3. That Wounds upon the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> how dubious &s;oever, are by no Means to be accounted de&s;perate, and that 'tis ju&s;tifiable Practice, after the U&s;e of the <HI>Trepan,</HI> the dreadful Symptoms not remitting, and the <HI>Membrane</HI> outwardly di&s;covering no apparent Cau&s;e, to make Apertion thro' for the Timely Di&s;charge of the extrava&s;ate Blood or Matter, under|neath: The Want of this Apertion, having rendred the&s;e Accidents, too often fatal.</P>
<P N="4">4. That neither the Fracture, nor depre&s;t <HI>Skull,</HI> how extraordinary &s;o|ever they might appear, were to be &s;urmi&s;ed, as the proper Cau&s;es of the Child's Death, in the foregoing Nar|rative, much le&s;s the Solution of Con|tinuity
<PB N="54" REF="74">made by the Lancet on the <HI>Dura Mater.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That the &s;hedding &s;ome Portion of the <HI>Brain,</HI> as hinted by the fir&s;t Inference, was none of the deadly Cau&s;es: But,</P>
<P N="6">6. That his Death was owing to the effu&s;ed Blood, from &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el upon the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> which had been ruptur'd by the Concu&s;&s;ion or Shock of the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, from the Force of the Blow: Which Blood pent in (for Want of a Di&s;charge) had form'd an Ab&s;ce&s;s, thereby deluging the Surface of the <HI>Brain</HI> with Matter: And this, tho' continually dreining of, thro' the Orifice in the upper <HI>Membrane,</HI> yet &s;ome Part thereof lying beyond the Ela&s;tic Power of the &s;aid <HI>Mem|brane</HI> to rai&s;e up, and out of the Reach of Medicine to deterge and mundi&s;ie, was at length imbibed by the Ve&s;&s;els, where mi&s;&s;ing the Salu|tary <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> &s;ometimes ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Empieme</HI> and <HI>Pluritic</HI> Ca&s;es, it was convey'd by the Circulation to the

<P N="7">7. That the <HI>Brain</HI> (ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed the Fountain as well of Motion as Sen&s;ation) is a Body &s;en&s;ele&s;s: That its Parts are not Homogeneous: That its Sub&s;tance is not &s;trictly glandulous, nor properly medullary: That we may call it <HI>Sub&s;tantia &s;ui-ip&s;ius, vel proprii generis,</HI> or &s;peaking plain Truth, we may &s;ay, 'tis &s;omething, we know not what.</P>
<P N="8">8. That we are very little acquaint|ed with the <HI>Modus</HI> of Sen&s;ation, or <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Motion, neither are we a|greed, whether there be an Intromi&s;|&s;ion to, or an Emi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Or|gan</HI> of the <HI>Species,</HI> to the Object, or <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> We know as little how the &s;ame is convey'd to the common <HI>Sen|&s;ory,</HI> or the <HI>Idaea</HI> there formed by the Soul: Nor is it uncontroverted whe|ther Sen&s;e in the common Accepta|tion, is not better accounted for by &s;imple Contact, after the Manner of a

<P N="9">9. That our Knowledge of the Cau|&s;es and Effects of &s;ome nervous Di|&s;tempers, arrives but to a well groun|ded Gue&s;s or Rational Conjecture, and in Likelyhood will continue as in|explicable to the Humane Under&s;tand|ing, under its pre&s;ent limited Condi|tion, as is the E&s;&s;ence of the Soul it &s;elf: On which Account it is more becoming a mode&s;t Man (however learn'd) to act the <HI>Sceptic</HI> rather than the <HI>Dogmati&s;t,</HI> with Relation to the&s;e ob&s;cure and intricate <HI>Phaenomena.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> that we mu&s;t de&s;|pair of bringing Medicine; under ex|act <HI>Mathematic</HI> Di&s;cipline, 'till the <HI>Primordia,</HI> or 'till the intime Nature

<P>A By-&s;tander looking over others Shoulders, whil&s;t I was laying a Piece of white <HI>Sar&s;net,</HI> into the Hole made in the Child's <HI>Skull,</HI> which we call a <HI>Syndon,</HI> (and which I verily believe hath often contributed to this vulgar Errour) went away, and reported he had &s;een the Plate fix'd in.</P>
<P>Now if they con&s;ider what Di&s;tur|bance they meet with, if any extra|neous Body be thru&s;t into the Fle&s;h, which has no Quiet 'till remov'd, or 'till the Place apo&s;temates or fe&s;ters,
<PB N="62" REF="82">and throws it out: They would &s;ee the Impo&s;&s;ibility of this Plate's uniting with, or growing to the Bone, where it cannot lie long, without putrifying the Fle&s;h, rotting the <HI>Skull,</HI> and drop|ping in upon the <HI>Brain:</HI> But if &s;ome Practitioners have been &s;o ba&s;e, as to contribute to this egregious Impo&s;iti|on on Mankind, 'tis not &s;trange that the People &s;hould &s;pread the Rumour, and deceive one another.</P>
<P>Thus I was told by a <HI>Surgeon</HI> u&s;ed to the Sea (too many of whom are apt to take the Traveller's Authority) who openly acknowledg'd, that un|der the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Gold Plate (which he put in, and after convey'd away) to fill up the Hole in his Pa|tient's Head, he had got more from him, than he could afterwards, for his Cure.</P>
<P>Farther, that we-may &s;ee the Na|ture and Prevalency of &s;preading Er|rour. One of my own Patients, as I have been inform'd, that &s;he might appear the greater Object, of their Wonder, tho' &s;he knew every Time &s;he told her Story, &s;he was telling a
<PB N="63" REF="83" MS="y">Lye of the fir&s;t Magnitude: would often a&s;&s;ert, &s;he carry'd one of the&s;e Plates in her Head; neither wanted &s;he for Vouchers, among&s;t &s;uch as fancy'd they could plainly feel it.</P>
<P>To put a final Stop therefore to this Errour, &s;o far at lea&s;t as this Publica|tion reacheth, and farther to grati&s;ie the Inqui&s;itive, who may want to be informed how the Hole is filled up: They are to conceive, that a new Fle&s;h is engender'd after few Days up|on the Skin that covers the <HI>Brain:</HI> and rai&s;eth it &s;elf up even (by the Help of Art) to the outer Edge of the <HI>Skull,</HI> where &s;oon after it hardens into what the <HI>Surgeons</HI> call a <HI>Callus,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Callus</HI> skin'd over, in &s;ome longer Time, becoming as hard as any other Part of the <HI>Skull</HI> it &s;elf. For the Truth of which, let the &s;till doubting, apply, them&s;elves to their own <HI>Surgeon.</HI></P>
