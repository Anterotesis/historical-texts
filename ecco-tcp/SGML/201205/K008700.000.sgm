<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to u&s;her in this performance to the world, by a preface in the common form, proving the importance of the &s;ubject to be treated of, and the nece&s;&s;ity of taking it up at this time. Both are &s;ufficiently felt, and acknowledged: it will there|fore &s;uffice, that I briefly expo&s;e my intention in the following &s;heets, &s;ubmitting it to the can|did and impartial publick, whe|ther the execution is an&s;werable to the de&s;ign.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
<P>I propo&s;ed fir&s;t, to give a di&s;|tinct and accurate idea of the ana|tomy of the teeth, and the ad|jacent parts, to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e accidents which ari&s;e from an ignorance in this point, in the practice of un&s;kiful practitioners; who, unacquainted with the &s;tructure of the parts, never fail to expo&s;e their patients to unnece&s;&s;ary pain, and frequent|ly to dangerous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Secondly; To point out the more immediate cau&s;es of the di&s;|ea&s;es of the teeth, and to &s;hew how they may be mitigated, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevented.</P>
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
<P>And thirdly; To introduce and recommend a more general atten|tion than has hitherto prevailed, for the pre&s;ervation of the teeth, &s;o u&s;eful to the purpo&s;es of life, and &s;o ornamental, in that part of the creation, where beauty &s;eems to have fix'd her peculiar feat.</P>
<P>A long, exten&s;ive, and I believe I may &s;ay, &s;ucce&s;sful practice, has enabled me to acquire the know|ledge, which I here pretend to communicate to the world; the &s;ubject is in &s;ome degree new in this country; I therefore hope for indul|gence, and claim no ab&s;olute merit but in my intention: whatever &s;hare I may be further entitled

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE TEETH.</HEAD>
<P>TEETH are bones of a particu|lar kind, given by nature in or|der to cut, break, and grind the nece&s;|&s;ary <HI>aliments,</HI> and to give a &s;tronger and more articulate &s;ound to the voice.</P>
<P>What is chiefly to be con&s;idered in the teeth, is their <HI>texture, number</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="9"><HI>figure;</HI> their exact order, and arrange|ment, and the time they begin to ap|pear.</P>
<P>In the&s;e bones we may di&s;tingui&s;h three parts, namely, the body, or <HI>crown,</HI> of the tooth, which appears out of the gums, the middle comprehending the &s;pace covered by the <HI>gums,</HI> and called the <HI>neck</HI> of the tooth, and la&s;tly the <HI>root,</HI> that lies buried in the <HI>&s;ocket.</HI></P>
<P>We find in a tooth three different &s;ub&s;tances. The fir&s;t &s;urrounds, and <HI>co|vers</HI> the body or <HI>crown</HI> of the teeth; it is thin, but grows thicker by degrees, as it draws near to the extremity of the <HI>crown.</HI> This &s;ub&s;tance is &s;o clo&s;e, and &s;o hard, that no impre&s;&s;ion, either with a file or any other &s;harp in&s;trument can be made on it, but with the greate&s;t difficulty and trouble, its colour is that of a pearl white peculiar to the teeth.</P>
<P>This &s;ub&s;tance is what we call the <HI>en|amel,</HI> and forms it&s;elf before the tooth
<PB N="3" REF="10">comes out; it grows &s;tronger and finer till the age of about 20, after which time it begins to wear off, by continual u&s;e; and &s;o liable it is to decay, that we often &s;ee per&s;ons of a middle age without the lea&s;t <HI>enamel</HI> on their teeth: &s;uch a thing very frequently happens in old men; but altho' the <HI>enamel</HI> be lo&s;t, or de&s;troy|ed, &s;till the tooth is not &s;o liable to de|cay as one may imagine, for we find many teeth firm and &s;ound in their in|ternal &s;ub&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding they have been deprived of their outward <HI>coat</HI> for many years: but however, when once it is gone, the tooth lies more expo&s;ed to the impre&s;&s;ion of heat and cold, and to be acted upon by any thing acid and &s;harp.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the <HI>enamel</HI> can never be repaired.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ub&s;tance is not &s;o clo&s;e as the former, and con&s;equently le&s;s hard; 'tis of a du&s;ky white colour, and
<PB N="4" REF="11">of the &s;ame nature as that of all hu|man bones, altho' &s;omewhat harder; it begins immediately under the <HI>enamel</HI> in the body of the tooth, and covers the neck, together with the whole root.</P>
<P>The third is that, which forms the mo&s;t internal part of the teeth, and is called the BULB; it is &s;oft in regard to the former, but pretty clo&s;e if we com|pare it to the marrow of the other bones.</P>
<P>The outward covering or <HI>enamel,</HI> and the bony part of the tooth are not &s;u&s;|ceptible of the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ation. The rea&s;on why teeth are affected by &s;ome|thing acid or &s;harp, is owing to a certain <HI>tremor</HI> that communicates, and as it were, thrills thro' the nerve in the in|ward part; if this nerve is left uncover|ed by a <HI>caries</HI> of the bony &s;ub&s;tance, then we are tormented by the mo&s;t excruciating pains.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<P>Men at 25 and about three years af|ter, have generally 28 teeth, 14 in each <HI>mandible</HI> or jaw.</P>
<P>This number encrea&s;es to 32, when the four teeth called <HI>dentes &s;apientiae</HI> ap|pear, but as the&s;e in &s;ome per&s;ons come out &s;ooner, in others later, and in &s;ome never, we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that the true number of teeth is generally 32.</P>
<P>Some writers were formerly of opini|on that men had 32 and women 28, but in&s;pection may plainly evince the ab&s;urdity of this notion.</P>
<P>All the teeth that exceed the num|ber of 32, may be reckoned as <HI>&s;upernu|merary.</HI> They generally pu&s;h out between the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> or <HI>fore teeth</HI> of the upper jaw, and in &s;uch a ca&s;e the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> are increa&s;ed in their number.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<P>The&s;e <HI>&s;upernumerary</HI> teeth re&s;emble very much the lateral <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> of the upper jaw.</P>
<P>And it happens that the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> al&s;o of the lower jaw, and the <HI>molares</HI> them|&s;elves, have been multiplied by interven|ing <HI>&s;upernumerary</HI> teeth.</P>
<P>Teeth are generally divided into three cla&s;&s;es, viz. the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> or cutting teeth; the <HI>canini</HI> or dog-teeth, and the <HI>mo|lares</HI> or grinders.</P>
<P>The <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> are eight in number; four in the front of each <HI>mandible.</HI> They are called <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> becau&s;e their bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to cut the <HI>aliments,</HI> for which purpo&s;e their outward form at the ex|tremities is peculiarly and wonderfully adapted. On the outer &s;urface, next the lips, they are a little convex, and on that, next the palate, concave. The two <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> in the middle of the up|per
<PB N="7" REF="14">jaw are larger, and often longer than tho&s;e on each &s;ide, or any of the other <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> for indeed the lateral upper <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> exceed the lower in mag|nitude.</P>
<P>The two middle upper <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> may be called the <HI>greater,</HI> tho&s;e on each &s;ide the <HI>le&s;&s;er,</HI> and the four of the lower <HI>mandible</HI> the <HI>&s;mall inci&s;ores.</HI> The&s;e teeth de&s;cribe a kind of &s;emicircle.</P>
<P>The <HI>canini</HI> are four in number; they lie one at each &s;ide next the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> be|tween them and the <HI>molares</HI> both jaws.</P>
<P>The&s;e teeth are rather longer, more round, and le&s;s cutting than the <HI>inci&s;ores.</HI></P>
<P>Their u&s;e is to part things that are of a &s;olid nature; in regard to their &s;tructure, they appear to be very pro|per, not only for cutting a&s;under any piece of &s;olid food, but al&s;o for keep|ing
<PB N="8" REF="15">it quite firm, while one endeavours to tear and &s;eparate it, as well as for gnawing bones, or any thing of that kind. They are called <HI>canini,</HI> becau&s;e they are very like to the teeth of a dog. The upper <HI>canini</HI> are al&s;o known by the name of <HI>eye teeth,</HI> becau&s;e it was anciently believed, that they had a kind of con|nection with the eyes, and that, by drawing any of them, the &s;ight was &s;uppo&s;ed to be endangered; but daily experience has clearly demon&s;trated, that &s;uch a connection, and danger, are merely imaginary.</P>
<P>Immediately after the&s;e come the <HI>mo|lares</HI> or grinders. They are 20 in num|ber, five on each &s;ide of both jaws.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t in each row, that is to &s;ay the neare&s;t to the <HI>canini,</HI> are the &s;mall grinders, the others the large.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="16">
<P>They are &s;o called becau&s;e they are thicker, blunter, and more flat at their extremities, than the re&s;t. They &s;erve like &s;o many <HI>mil&s;tones,</HI> to brui&s;e and grind the food.</P>
<P>Their figures are almo&s;t &s;quare. The broad end, or top of each grinder, is divided into &s;everal little <HI>eminences</HI> and <HI>cavities,</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that when the jaws &s;hut, the <HI>eminences</HI> of the upper grinders are Received into the cavities of the lower, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot help admiring with a&s;to|ni&s;hment the works of <HI>Providence</HI> in the figure and exact di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e teeth, which can never be too clo&s;ely examined.</P>
<P>In order therefore to form a better idea of this admirable contrivance, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the lower jaw is a kind of a <HI>leaver,</HI> re&s;ting
<PB N="10" REF="17">it&s;elf at the extremity, where it joins by <HI>articulation</HI> to the <HI>temporal bones,</HI> the <HI>aliments</HI> are the re&s;i&s;ting bodies, and the <HI>elevatory</HI> mu&s;cles are the acting powers to overcome that re&s;i&s;tance by rai&s;ing of the jaw.</P>
<P>The grinders which are rather blunt, &s;tand nearer the center of motion, and con&s;equently pre&s;s more forcibly than the re&s;t; and this is the rea&s;on, that when we would bite &s;omething re|markably hard, we generally place it between the <HI>molares;</HI> the <HI>canini</HI> and the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> can never act with &s;o much force, being farther removed from the centre of motion, but their want of power is &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated by their form.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the name and <HI>charac|teri&s;tical</HI> figure of the teeth, enough has been &s;aid concerning that part of the teeth, which appears out of the gums, viz. the <HI>crown,</HI> therefore we &s;hall pro|ceed to their neck.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="11" REF="18">
<HEAD>Of the Neck of the <HI>TEETH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Neck</HI> is that part of the tooth covered by the gums, and a bony &s;ub&s;tance, which as we &s;aid before, is of a du&s;ky white colour.</P>
<P>In this <HI>neck</HI> we find, in that part where it joins to the gums, &s;ome little enequalities, or rather wrinkles, that cau&s;e &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els belonging to the gums, to adhere more clo&s;ely to the <HI>neck</HI> of the teeth; by this means, not only &s;aline particles are prevented from getting into the <HI>&s;ockets,</HI> but the tooth is al&s;o rendered &s;o firm and &s;trong, as to &s;ecure it from being &s;hook or loo&s;en|ed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>ROOT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>root</HI> is that part which is buried in the <HI>&s;ocket,</HI> a continuation of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance and colour as that of the
<PB N="12" REF="19">neck. It is covered by a membrane exactly &s;imilar to that which lines the <HI>&s;ocket.</HI></P>
<P>The root of each tooth is generally longer than the body, and is thereby rendered more able to bear any &s;train or violent impre&s;&s;ion, occa&s;ioned &s;ometimes by chewing, gnawing, or breaking bodies of a hard nature.</P>
<P>In every root we find, towards the extremity, a little hole which is a pa&s;|&s;age to the internal &s;ub&s;tance, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>bulb</HI> of the tooth.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a little branch of an <HI>artery,</HI> a &s;mall <HI>vein,</HI> and a nervous <HI>fila|ment.</HI> This hole is clo&s;ed up in old age, and then teeth lo&s;e their <HI>&s;en|&s;ation.</HI> Various are the figures of roots, and in each &s;pecies of teeth, there is a particular one.</P>
<P>In all the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> there is but one root to each tooth, which decrea&s;es gra|dually, and ends at la&s;t in a point.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="20">
<P>The <HI>canini</HI> likewi&s;e have generally but one root; but there are &s;ome with two, quite divided through all their extent, and others only at the extremities; &s;uch teeth however are very uncommon. The &s;ides of the roots of the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> and the <HI>canini,</HI> are flat; and the&s;e re&s;t upon the partition of each &s;ocket: in the &s;ame manner, the flat &s;ide of the contiguous tooth re&s;ts on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;ame partition; which me|chani&s;m fixes more firmly the&s;e teeth in their &s;ockets, and as their necks and bodies are al&s;o flat laterally, where they are applied to the other teeth; thus they receive mutually a &s;trong and con&s;ide|rable &s;upport by being &s;o well adapted to each other.</P>
<P>The &s;mall grinders, namely, tho&s;e that come immediately after the <HI>canini,</HI> on each &s;ide of both jaws, have generally but one root; &s;ome are found with two, and &s;ome even with three; but &s;uch a ca&s;e is very rare. The &s;mall grinders
<PB N="14" REF="21">that have but one root, have it always flat on the &s;ides, and therefore it &s;upports it&s;elf in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>inci&s;orers</HI> and the <HI>canini.</HI></P>
<P>The number of roots in the large <HI>molares,</HI> both in the upper and lower jaw, is very uncertain.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome large grinders, with one or two flat roots, and each root &s;eems to be formed of two joined to|gether, di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a kind of a little channel, which begins immediate|ly after the <HI>crown</HI> of the teeth, and appears through all their extent, in or|der to mark out the divi&s;ion. There are in &s;ome large grinders, three, four, and &s;ometimes five roots, quite &s;eparate from one another, extending them&s;elves in a large compa&s;s; for which rea&s;on, &s;uch teeth are deeply rooted, and &s;tick more clo&s;ely to the <HI>&s;ocket.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it happens, that the <HI>molares</HI> are not &s;o ea&s;ily drawn out of their
<PB N="15" REF="22">&s;ocket whenever the adjoining tooth is wanting.</P>
<P>The la&s;t grinders, otherwi&s;e called <HI>dentes &s;apientiae</HI> have fewer roots, than the two teeth that precede them, and their body is not &s;o thick. They have generally but two roots joined to each other, which very &s;eldom appear &s;eparate in all their extent, or even at their extremities; there have been &s;ome notwith&s;tanding, with three, four and even five roots, very plainly divided one from another; but this ca&s;e is not &s;o common.</P>
<P>The <HI>crown</HI> or body of the&s;e teeth, is almo&s;t all covered by the gums. Sometimes the roots of the large grin|ders are crookedly enclined towards the internal part of the <HI>&s;ocket,</HI> and &s;ome|times towards the external. Some are in an undulating form, and &s;ome are bent one again&s;t the other, or laid acro&s;s all together, and therefore
<PB N="16" REF="23">it is a very difficult ta&s;k to draw a tooth of this kind. For if ever one of the&s;e roots bends with a point quite oppo&s;ite to another root that may be lodged in the little <HI>cell</HI> or the next <HI>&s;ocket,</HI> then the&s;e two roots will form, as it were, a pair of pinchers, and gripe with their ex|tremities, the bony &s;ub&s;tance that parts one cell from another; and con&s;equent|ly in drawing a tooth with tho&s;e roots, we are forced either to tear the bony partition of the cells, or if this &s;hould re&s;i&s;t, then either one or the other, and &s;ometimes both the&s;e crooked ex|tremities mu&s;t break, and in both ca&s;es it may be of very bad con&s;equence. There is al&s;o great danger in drawing the upper <HI>molares,</HI> le&s;t you &s;hould tear with the tooth, the bottom of the &s;ocket, together with a very thin bony <HI>lamina</HI> or &s;cale that parts it from a cavity called the <HI>maxillary finus,</HI> for then the mucous membrane is unluckily torn, and this gives occa&s;ion for <HI>inflammations</HI> and <HI>ulcers</HI> in that membrane, and
<PB N="17" REF="24">may even produce a <HI>cancerous</HI> ulcer, as it has happened in many ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Every root has a hole that com|municates with the cavity in the mid|dle of the crown, which cavity in the grinders, is divided into as many &s;mall &s;inu&s;es as there are little eminences on the ba&s;e, which is lined with a mem|brane that &s;erves as a &s;heath to the &s;mall blood-ve&s;&s;els and nerves, that are included in the internal part of the tooth. At the extremity of each root there is, as we &s;aid before, one or more little holes that receive nerves, <HI>blood-ve&s;|&s;els,</HI> and perhaps ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which by their connexion together, form what we call, the <HI>cord</HI> of the tooth; this <HI>cord</HI> pa&s;&s;es through the cavity of the root, and conveys a proper nouri&s;h|ment to the &s;ub&s;tance of the tooth, and as it draws nearer the crown, it be|comes thicker by means of the men|brane that lines the cavity.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="25">
<P>The <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> and <HI>canini</HI> have their nerves from a <HI>branch</HI> of the fifth <HI>pair,</HI> called the upper <HI>maxillary,</HI> which in|&s;inuates it&s;elf into the orbital canal, from whence it comes out, to be di&s;tributed on the face, and in its way &s;ends off filaments for all the roots of the&s;e teeth.</P>
<P>The <HI>molares</HI> likewi&s;e receive their nerves from the &s;ame <HI>branch</HI> through &s;mall holes, formed in the hinder part of the external lateral &s;urface of the upper <HI>maxillary</HI> bone.</P>
<P>The <HI>veins</HI> and <HI>arteries,</HI> as they al|ways join with the nerves, communicate them&s;elves the &s;ame way to the teeth. The&s;e <HI>arteries</HI> are <HI>branches</HI> of the exter|nal <HI>carotids</HI> and the veins of the jugular.</P>
<P>The nerves of the lower jaw, are from another branch of the fifth pair, called the inferior <HI>maxillary,</HI> which
<PB N="19" REF="26">enters into a canal on the in&s;ide of the angle of the lower jaw, and is con|tinued on each &s;ide to the chin, a little below the roots of the teeth; in pa&s;&s;|ing along this bony canal, the nerve &s;ends off filaments to the roots of each of the <HI>molares</HI> and <HI>canini,</HI> and is then divided into two branches, one of which comes out of a hole of the bone in the chin, called the mental hole, to be then di&s;tributed to the chin and mu&s;cles of the under lip. The other branch pa&s;&s;es on to the <HI>&s;ympha&s;is</HI> of the lower jaw, and is di&s;tributed to the roots of the inci&s;ores and deploe of the bone? The arteries which are &s;ent to the teeth of this mandible, have their ri&s;e from the external <HI>carotid,</HI> and follow preci&s;ely the cour&s;e of the nerve through this bony canal, and accom|pany it through the whole of its di&s;|tribution. The veins ari&s;e from the external <HI>jugular.</HI></P>
<PB N="20" REF="27">
<P>It therefore appears from what has been &s;aidon this &s;ubject, that a tooth ach in the molares or grinders, mu&s;t be more exqui&s;itely painful than in any of the other teeth; for as the molares are furni&s;hed with a greater number of roots, and each root having its artery, vein and nerve, it therefore follows that a tooth of five roots mu&s;t have fifteen &s;en&s;ative bodies, which, if expo&s;ed to heat and cold, by a caries of the bony matter, will <HI>caeteris paribus</HI> produce a greater quantity of pain, than that of a tooth with a &s;ingle root.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>SOCKETS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The &s;ockets are cavities formed in the jaw-bones, for the receiving and fixing the teeth, but the&s;e will be better under&s;tood, by giving a previ|ous idea of the mandibles in general, which have &s;o great a &s;hare in forming the countenance; for if the teeth be

<P>The mandibles may be con&s;idered as two bony arches lying parallel to eathother.

<P>The lower jaw is likewi&s;e compo&s;ed of two bones, e&s;pecially in the infant
<PB N="22" REF="29">&s;tate; which are firmly united at the &s;ympha&s;is of the chin, &s;o as to make but one bone in adults; this bone is re|markably hard in the lower part, al|tho' &s;omewhat &s;pungy on its upper, in order to afford a more convenient bed for the teeth.

<P>After this general idea of the &s;truc|ture of the mandibles, we &s;hall now treat of the &s;ockets in particular, which are cavities formed by the teeth in the <HI>diploe,</HI> or &s;pungy &s;ub&s;tance of the jaw bones, divided into as many little <HI>fo&s;|&s;ulae</HI> as there are roots of each tooth. The&s;e little cavities are lined with a thin ela&s;tic &s;caly &s;ub&s;tance, not &s;o hard as the other parts of the bone, and &s;ufficiently pliable, to become a per|fect mould for the teeth, which in
<PB N="23" REF="30">ca&s;es of violent compre&s;&s;ion or &s;hocks, gives way, &s;o as to prevent in &s;ome mea&s;ure the teeth from being loo&s;ened or broke.</P>
<P>We do not find in the jaws of in|fants the &s;ockets intirely form'd, at lea&s;t they do not appear &s;o, for there are but ten or twelve in each <HI>mandible,</HI> and the&s;e not deep; all the &s;ockets in thickne&s;s are not alike, for each &s;pecies of teeth have their particular ones.</P>
<P>The <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> of the upper jaw have their &s;ockets thinner than tho&s;e of other teeth, and the <HI>canini</HI> theirs &s;tronger, con&s;equently thicker than the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> or even the &s;mall <HI>molares.</HI> The fir&s;t large grinder has its &s;ocket &s;tronger than the &s;econd, and la&s;t grinder.</P>
<P>In the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> of the lower jaw, we find their &s;ockets thinner, than in all
<PB N="24" REF="31">other teeth of that <HI>mandible,</HI> and this is the rea&s;on that tho&s;e teeth are more liable to &s;hocks, and it is likewi&s;e ea&s;ier to draw them. The <HI>canini</HI> have their &s;ockets thicker than the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> and the &s;mall grinders, but the &s;mall grinders have theirs thicker than the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> of this jaw. The fir&s;t large one of the molares, has not the &s;ocket &s;o thick as the &s;econd and third, which la&s;t one has it thicker, becau&s;e of the <HI>apophy&s;is coro|noide,</HI> and that is the rea&s;on why it proves generally very difficult to draw.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ockets, when teeth are drawn, or naturally fail, are generally de&s;troy|ed in a very &s;hort time, in&s;omuch that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to perceive any marks of them, as we daily &s;ee in ex|amining the <HI>mandibles.</HI> But if ever in drawing a tooth, &s;ome part of the
<PB N="25" REF="32">&s;ocket was to be torn, then the &s;ides would be found not quite &s;o thick, nor &s;o firmly joined in that place. The &s;ockets are outwardly covered, and lined inwardly, with a membrane or <HI>perio&s;tium,</HI> common with the root of the tooth; it is a continuation of the <HI>perio&s;tium</HI> that covers the other bones, and of the &s;ame membrane that lines the internal part of the mouth.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>GUMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The fle&s;hy part that &s;urrounds the &s;ocket, is called the gums, the&s;e are made of a hard &s;ub&s;tance, rather <HI>fibrous</HI> than glandulous. They are pene|trated and moi&s;tened by different ve&s;&s;els, namely, by <HI>veins, arteries and lympha|ties.</HI> The texture, of the gums is of a <HI>coriaceous</HI> nature, with fibres interwoven like a hat's felt, very clo&s;e and <HI>ela&s;tic,</HI> of a pale vermilion colour; all the bor|der of the &s;ockets in both the inward
<PB N="26" REF="33">and outward &s;ide of the jaw, is co|vered by the gums which in&s;inuate between all the teeth, and adhere &s;o clo&s;ely to the neck of each of them, that they prevent any thing acid or &s;harp from touching the &s;ocket. Before the teeth come out, the gums are all of a body, without the lea&s;t &s;e|paration; and as the teeth begin to &s;hoot out, they pierce the gums and make &s;o many holes as there are teeth in the <HI>mandible.</HI></P>
<P>The gums are joined to the jaws by the perio&s;tium, which they every where cover. The outward covering of the gums extends it&s;elf from the crown or body of the teeth, over the cheeks and lips, and &s;eems in every re&s;pect to be a continuation of the &s;ame membrane.</P>
<P>The inward gums of the upper jaw, go from the internal part of the neck of the teeth, as far as the circumfer|ence
<PB N="27" REF="34">of the roof of the <HI>palate,</HI> and tho&s;e of the lower <HI>mandible,</HI> as far as the circumference of the ban&s;is of the tongue.</P>
<P>When a tooth happens to fail, the gum covers the orifice of the &s;ocket, which being &s;oon &s;hut up or de&s;troyed, the external part of the gum joins with the internal one, and they unite them&s;elves very clo&s;ely together, be|coming &s;o hard and &s;o firm a body, that we &s;ee men, who, after having lo&s;t all their teeth, brui&s;e the aliment with their gums, altho' they cannot cut or mince with them; in this ca&s;e the gums re-a&s;&s;ume the very &s;ame figure they had before the teeth appeared.</P>
<P>The gums no doubt are the pre|fervers of the teeth, &s;ince they keep them quite firm in their &s;ockets, and &s;ave them from being touched by any thing heterogeneous or pernicious,
<PB N="28" REF="35">which might produce the mo&s;t pain|ful di&s;orders in the teeth, and even a total de&s;truction of them.</P>
<P>The gums when properly ranged, contribute very much to the ornament of the mouth, for as the&s;e are of a vermilion ca&s;t, and form a kind of a <HI>cre&s;cent,</HI> or half moon, around the enamel, of each tooth; they &s;et off in a more elegant manner the whitene&s;s of the teeth, when we have occa&s;ion to &s;hew them by &s;miling, &amp;c. <HI>Of the</HI> GENERATION <HI>of</HI> TEET II.</P>
<P>Nature in forming the&s;e bones, &s;eems to deviate intirely from tho&s;e laws that &s;he has e&s;tabli&s;hed in the production of all other bodies, and to chu&s;e a peculiar uncommon me|thod in this generation.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of natural produc|tions have their beginning in their
<PB N="29" REF="36">roots, but a tooth on the contrary does not begin to form its root till the body is perfectly fini&s;hed. The fir&s;t &s;ub|&s;tance that begins to appear in this body, is not the internal part, as one would imagine, but the external one, the farthe&s;t from the root, and what is call|ed <HI>Enamel.</HI> This &s;ub&s;tance in its begin|ing is nothing but a mucous &s;oft pa&s;te, which acquires in&s;en&s;ibly &s;o much firm|ne&s;s, that it becomes at la&s;t a bony part, &s;o hard and &s;o white, that it ex|cels all other bones, (as we have &s;hewn in its proper place) in point of hard|ne&s;s and whitene&s;s. When once this &s;cale, or bony coat is formed, the tooth a&s;&s;umes directly a proper figure, and its inward part begins to be filled.</P>
<P>The germ of the teeth, like that of other bones before o&s;&s;ification, is com|po&s;ed of a ti&s;&s;ulated mucus &s;eparated and divided into a number of little
<PB N="30" REF="37">cells; which are afterwards filled up with calcareous or bony matter, and con&s;titutes the &s;olidity of the bone. This germ is contained in little lodges or <HI>cells</HI> of the &s;ockets, which it &s;tretches in proportion as the bulk of the tooth augments, and &s;preads; at the &s;ame time its membrane increa&s;es, and takes hold of the root, and forms the <HI>perio&s;tium</HI> that &s;urrounds it.</P>
<P>The body of the tooth being quite fini&s;hed, the root takes then its due form, and as it grows &s;tronger, it lengthens by degrees till it becomes of a proper length, the extremities grow firm and bony, leaving however a free pa&s;&s;age to the ve&s;&s;els, that run through the cavity of its root, and pene|trate with their nouri&s;hing juices to the very inward body of the teeth. While the root grows thicker and &s;tronger, fini&s;hing it&s;elf within the &s;ocket, the body of the tooth ri&s;es to|wards
<PB N="31" REF="38">wards the gum, and attempts to come out. It begins by dilating the parti|tions of the &s;ocket, and being level with this bony border, it cuts immedi|ately the <HI>membrane,</HI> in which it is in|clo&s;ed, then the other <HI>membrane</HI> that covers the &s;ocket, and at la&s;t the gum; in this manner &s;hoots forth the teeth.</P>
<P>The partition of the &s;ocket will lengthen in proportion as the tooth draws nearer the gum; but altho' in lengthening they are compre&s;&s;ed and grow &s;tronger, &s;till they retain an ela&s;|ticity, by which they render the tooth &s;afer and &s;tronger in ca&s;e any accident &s;hould befall it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame oeconomy we find in the <HI>molares,</HI> that are furni&s;hed with more roots, and con&s;equently have more <HI>cells</HI> in their &s;ockets, which always multi|ply at the &s;ame time, when the roots appear, as was &s;aid before. It would be natural to think that in tho&s;e teeth
<PB N="32" REF="39">that have but one root, their &s;ockets &s;hould be found greater in diameter than the root it&s;elf, as the &s;ocket has taken the form and figure of the body of the tooth, which is fir&s;t of all form|ed in it, and is always of a larger dia|meter than the root, but it is never &s;o, on account of the above mentioned <HI>cla&s;tic</HI> force belonging to the partition of the &s;ockets, in&s;omuch that as &s;oon as the body of the tooth is out of the &s;ocket, the &s;ocket contracts, and a|dapts it&s;elf, by degrees, to the figure of the root, holding it &s;o clo&s;e and &s;o firm as if it were fixed in a vice or &s;crew.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> ERUPTION <HI>of the</HI> TEETH.</HEAD>
<P>Children, when they are brought into the world, have generally no teeth; I &s;ay generally, becau&s;e &s;ome have been found with two, three and even four <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> two in the upper
<PB N="33" REF="40">jaw and two in the lower one; but the&s;e ca&s;es are not to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule, being only an exception.</P>
<P>Teeth appear &s;ooner or later, ac|cording to the weaker or &s;tronger con|&s;titution of the child; there have been &s;ome of them who have cut their teeth when they were two or three months old, and &s;ometimes not before they were a year or fifteen months; but for the generality, in the fifth, &s;ixth or eighth month after their birth the fir&s;t tooth begins to appear. The two &s;mall <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> of the lower jaw are the fir&s;t that come out, the one fifteen days after the other.</P>
<P>The large <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> of the upper jaw appear almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, then two appear in the lower jaw at the &s;ide of the former, and then other two in the upper jaw; this is the general order in which the <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> are &s;een.
<PB N="34" REF="41">When the child is eleven months, or a year old, the lower <HI>canini</HI> appear almo&s;t always at the &s;ame time; and a few days after the upper canini likewi&s;e &s;hoot forth together, and the&s;e cau&s;e greater pain than the former.</P>
<P>When children are about &s;ixteen or twenty months old, the two &s;mall lower grinders come out, and in a few days after the other two of the upper jaw; the other four molares do not generally appear till the child is two years old, one at each &s;ide of the mandibles. The&s;e make twenty in number, and are called <HI>milk-teeth,</HI> the child remaining in this &s;ituation, till about the &s;ixth year of its age.</P>
<P>The order we have de&s;cribed, is not always exact, for we often &s;ee the &s;mall grinders &s;hoot forth &s;ooner than the
<PB N="35" REF="42"><HI>canini,</HI> and the <HI>canini</HI> quicker than the lateral <HI>inci&s;ores.</HI> At the age of five or &s;ix years, the other four <HI>molares</HI> appear next to tho&s;e lately come out in each mandible. Towards the eleventh or twelveth year, four other <HI>molares</HI> come out in the &s;ame order, as do likewi&s;e four others in the 17th or 18th, which in all make 28, viz. eight <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> or fore teeth, four <HI>canini</HI> and 16 <HI>molares</HI> or grinders; with the&s;e teeth we gene|rally continue till the four la&s;t molares, called dentes &s;apientiae appear; the exact time of which is very uncertain, tho' u&s;ually it happens at the age of 25, or even 28; nor are there in&s;tances wanting of their not appearing before the age of 50, when they are for the mo&s;t part accompanied with tumours and fluxions on the neighbouring parts, which proceed from the pre&s;&s;ure cau&s;ed by the crown of the tooth, on the &s;ides of the &s;ocket, and on the fle&s;hy
<PB N="36" REF="43">and membranous point of the gum, which at that time of life, is become more hard and obdurate. At the age of &s;even or eight years, the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> the <HI>canini,</HI> and the &s;mall <HI>molares,</HI> are &s;hed in the &s;ame order as they did ap|pear. When the&s;e are gone, as many &s;tronger and more beautiful teeth take their place.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that if one of the <HI>milk-teeth</HI> is drawn before it is loo&s;e, we find in it a root as firm as that of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> tooth; but on the contrary, if it is drawn when it is loo&s;e, there is no root at all: this has given ri&s;e to a variety of opinions, concerning the de&s;|tination, or rather de&s;truction of the roots of the milk-teeth: it is imagined by &s;ome, that they are entirely con&s;umed by a flux of acid humours, which ab&s;orb the calcareous matter of the roots, and &s;o
<PB N="37" REF="44">decompo&s;e the con&s;tituent parts; while others &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e roots are in|corporated into the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;econd teeth. But as the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions are not &s;upported by the lea&s;t appear|ance, of fact, we &s;hall not therefore take up the time of the reader, to prove the contrary of them, but &s;hall only ob&s;erve, &s;uch an acid humour could not exi&s;t without de&s;troying all the teeth, and that &s;uch an incorporation into the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;econd tooth, has never yet been found. It appears by &s;everal of the later di&s;coveries made in anatomy, that many parts nece&s;&s;ary to the body, in the embrio and infant &s;tate, are totally lo&s;t and obliterated in that of adults, and that tho&s;e parts which are become u&s;ele&s;s and redun|dant in the &s;y&s;tem, are ab&s;orbed, and taken up the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els to be afterwards thrown out at the different emunctories of the body, that this is
<PB N="38" REF="45">in reality the ca&s;e with the roots of the milk-teeth, may be fully a&s;certained by a variety of &s;imilar facts, that the nature of this work won't admit to enu|merate.</P>
<P>Sometimes, tho' &s;eldom, the large <HI>molares,</HI> and even the dentes &s;apientiae, will &s;hed, as happened lately to a lady, who was tortured with a mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite pain in one of the <HI>dentes &s;apien|tiae,</HI> on the right &s;ide of the lower jaw. I felt the tooth quite loo&s;e, which I drew with my fingers, but found no root to it: this I concluded to be owing to another tooth lying under it, which I &s;oon perceived on further examining of the &s;ocket: as the excruciating pain &s;till continued, the lady could not be per&s;uaded that there was another tooth to come out, but that the root of the former was left behind; however, the appearance of the new tooth, not long
<PB N="39" REF="46">after, fully convinced her, that the pain was entirely owing to the. &s;mall|ne&s;s and firmne&s;s of the &s;ocket, which retarded the egre&s;s of the young tooth, and obliged it in a manner to grind its pa&s;&s;age out.</P>
<P>There is an opinion prevails, that there is a very great ri&s;que in drawing <HI>milk-teeth</HI> before they are loo&s;e, but in reality, there is not the &s;malle&s;t. danger, and indeed, when they are careous, or any other way painful, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to draw them, to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible an inflam|mation of the gums, and adjoining parts, which might de&s;troy the germ of the &s;econd tooth.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to draw tho&s;e teeth that lie acro&s;s, or ride upon one another, (a very di&s;agreeable &s;ight) in order to give a more exact and uni|form arrangement to the re&s;t. This
<PB N="40" REF="47">defect of order in the canini and in|ci&s;ores, in general proceeds from an extreme narrowne&s;s of the jaws. But the operator mu&s;t be very circum&s;pect in examining every circum&s;tance re|lative to the tooth and &s;ocket before he draws a milk-tooth, for if a part of the &s;ocket &s;hould be broke and give way, the &s;econd tooth will always come out in an irregular and ununi|form manner.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Di&s;orders incident to Children in teeth|ing, and the manner of treating them.</HEAD>
<P>The eruption of teeth in children, is often attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences, by exciting fevers, con|vulsions, gripes in the inte&s;tines, aci|dities in the &s;tomach, attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences, and finally by
<PB N="41" REF="48">introducing a great degree of irritabi|lity in their tender constitutions, &s;o that they become more liable to a greater variety of di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Children &s;uffer in teething, fir&s;t in proportion to the delicacy and &s;en&s;ibi|lity of their con&s;titutions. Secondly, to the number and figure of their teeth that pu&s;h out at the &s;ame time. Thirdly, to the &s;tate of the gums, which in &s;ome children is found to be more ten&s;e and liable to inflammation than in others.</P>
<P>Children who are originally of a deli|cate habit, or who have been rendered &s;o by milk of an improper quality, or by any other cau&s;e that impairs their di|ge&s;tion, and produces acidities in their &s;tomachs and inte&s;tines, are extremely liable to convul&s;ions in teething; on
<PB N="42" REF="49">the contrary, children of a &s;trong ro|bu&s;t make, who&s;e food is converted into proper nouri&s;hment, are le&s;s &s;ub|ject to convul&s;ive di&s;orders, but are liable often to a degree of fever, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure facilitates the eruption of the teeth. Secondly, the number and figure of the teeth that &s;hoot out at once, will greatly increa&s;e the pain, for the blunt flat molares, will meet with a much greater re&s;i&s;|tance, and a greater degree of lacera|tion, than the &s;harp pointed inci&s;ores or canini.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the canini will prolong the pain from their wedge like figure, which is continually delating the &s;ocket and gum, till the tooth has compleated its growth.</P>
<P>From this great difficulty, that teeth have to cut the gums, a great
<PB N="43" REF="50">many mi&s;chiefs are frequently produc|ed, for as inflammation is always the con&s;equence of laceration and pre&s;&s;ure, this by going too far, occa&s;ions fre|quently &s;welled glands about the throat and neck, which &s;ometimes &s;uppurate, and even ulcers in the gums, and neigh|bouring parts, have been produced. In order to mitigate, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure prevent the di&s;orders ari&s;ing from teething, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider well what has been already &s;aid in regard to the tendency of na|ture to inflammation in the &s;trong and robu&s;t children, and to convul&s;ions, gripes and loo&s;ene&s;s in the weak, ten|der and delicate; in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the degree of fever and inflammation, may be lowered, by keeping the nur&s;e up|on a low diet, avoiding animal food, &s;pices, or what ever tends to &s;timu|late and encrea&s;e the circulation; fre|quent but &s;mall do&s;es of rhubarb,
<PB N="44" REF="51">ought to be administered to the nur&s;e, which will gently purge the child, in the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t commodious manner; in the mean time, if the gums are much &s;welled, &s;carrifying them with the point of a lancet, &s;o as to make them bleed at &s;everal parts, will empty the di&s;tended ve&s;&s;els, and remove the ten&s;ion from the inflamed gums and where the fever runs high, even bleed|ing with leeches or the lancet, will be of great &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In the other ca&s;e, where convul&s;ions are &s;o often the con&s;equence, we mu&s;t endeavour to prevent the&s;e frightful &s;ymptoms by every method that may tend to &s;trengthen and confirm their con&s;titutions, &s;uch as having a &s;trong and healthy nur&s;e, taking care that &s;he lives on the mo&s;t &s;imple and nouri&s;hing food, giving the child a whole&s;ome country air, with a good deal of exerci&s;e, and exhibiting &s;mall do&s;es of aromatick infu&s;ions of the bark, powder of tin, or &s;uch like.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="52">
<P>Where a loo&s;ene&s;s and gripes pre|vail, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to take every method to prevent that tendency to acidity which mo&s;tly takes place in infants, whenever dige&s;tion is any way di&s;turbed; this is be&s;t done by giving frequent, but &s;mall do&s;es of the ab&s;or|bent powders, conjoined with aroma|ticks; and perhaps rhubarb, or more a&s;tringent &s;imples, with opiates, may be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In children of relaxed habits, who&s;e gums are loo&s;e and flabby, there is very little tendency to inflam|mation, in that ca&s;e applying mild a&s;tringents (&s;uch as a decoction of ro&s;e buds in vinegar) to the gums by the nur&s;e's finger, will help greatly to brace up and facilitate the eruption of the tooth. But in all ca&s;es, where the &s;ymp|toms are trouble&s;ome, and the tooth tardy in coming out, the only effectual means is to make a free exit for it by inci&s;ion, and to cut the gum quit down to the tooth; and indeed wherever a
<PB N="46" REF="53">tooth &s;eems ready to appear, and the child is pining and &s;uffering much, we ought to recur immediately to inci|&s;ion, and in that way remove the pain that is occa&s;ioned by the di&s;traction of &s;uch &s;en&s;ative parts.</P>
<P>Sometimes where the gum has been already cut, and the teeth very &s;low in growing, the parts unite, and a cica|trix is formed above it; here we &s;hould again cut the gum and perio&s;tium, &s;o as to lay the tooth quite bare.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the &s;trong and healthy children, a number of teeth will pu&s;h out at the &s;ame time, by which means the &s;ymptoms are greatly aggravated; here al&s;o we &s;hould give a free exit by inci&s;ion, then gentle emollients &s;hould be applied to the gums, and every thing that is irritating be avoided.</P>
<P>Particular attention &s;hould be paid to the lea&s;t &s;ore or ulcer that maybe formed
<PB N="47" REF="54">about the&s;e parts, le&s;t they de&s;troy the germ of the &s;ub&s;equent tooth.</P>

<P>The external cau&s;es are al&s;o many. The general ones are, the u&s;e of ali|ments too hot, or too cold, the dif|ferent impre&s;&s;ions of air, all &s;hocks given to the teeth, which affect the nerves, the vapours that ari&s;e from the &s;tomach and lungs, and leave a noxious and di&s;agreeable &s;lime on the teeth; any particles of food that &s;tick be|twixt the teeth and putrify; keeping the head uncovered and expo&s;ed to the air; &s;leeping bareheaded, as likewi&s;e the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;moking and chewing tobacco; the many improper remedies al&s;o that are made u&s;e of to keep the teeth clean, and the <HI>cau&s;tics</HI> applied in order to mitigate the pain, are always &s;ure to de&s;troy tho&s;e they unluckily touch; hence we may &s;ee, of what importance it is never to make u&s;e of any remedies, but what are approved of by a &s;kilful per&s;on. Sugar, when u&s;ed immoderately, is another enemy to the teeth; but one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="56">dreadful de&s;troyers is <HI>mercury.</HI> One ought therefore to be extremely cautious in u&s;ing it. All <HI>mineral</HI> exhalations are al&s;o very pernicious, as we &s;ee it by daily experience in all tho&s;e per&s;ons that work in any of the <HI>quick-&s;ilver, lead,</HI> or <HI>copper</HI> mines, &amp;c. &s;uch people generally have their teeth coroded, dive&s;ted of their <HI>enamel,</HI> and &s;ometimes entirely wa&s;ted away by the <HI>corro&s;ive</HI> particles exhaling from tho&s;e <HI>minerals.</HI> Among the external cau&s;es however, negligence may be reckoned the fir&s;t; for let the lymph be ever &s;o pure, and dige&s;tion ever &s;o regular, there are always &s;ome vi&s;cid exhalations that are apt to &s;ettle upon the teeth; the&s;e can ea&s;ily be removed, but if neglected, may prove the cau&s;e of many mi&s;chievous di&s;orders, as we &s;hall &s;hew hereafter.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to give my readers a li&s;t, (as many have done) of the various di&s;orders incident to the teeth, but to comprehend them under
<PB N="50" REF="57">two &s;ingle articles, namely, <HI>ero&s;ion</HI> and <HI>caries;</HI> and we &s;hall take notice like|wi&s;e of what is commonly called the <HI>tartar. Ero&s;ion</HI> is a di&s;order that ren|ders the teeth rough, and as if worm-eaten.</P>
<P>It affects only children, either when the fir&s;t teeth &s;hoot forth, or when the &s;econd ones appear. The ori|ginal cau&s;es of the&s;e di&s;orders are the &s;mall pox, the mea&s;les, and all tho&s;e di&s;orders that contaminate the juices. It penetrates more or le&s;s, according o the hardne&s;s and firmne&s;s of the teeth; and therefore if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould &s;eize the child, when his teeth are not &s;ufficiently firm and o&s;&s;ified, it mu&s;t be attended with bad con&s;equences, meeting with little re&s;&s;i&s;tance in the parts not &s;ufficiently o&s;&s;ified.</P>
<P>But if it &s;hould come on when the <HI>milk</HI> teeth are &s;hedding, and the new
<PB N="51" REF="58">ones appear, it will be of no harm to the tooth that has not as yet come out. The <HI>enamel</HI> of the tooth can never be hurt, but when wrapt up in its mem|brane, as it is then nothing el&s;e but in the &s;tate of a &s;oft mucus, which being rendered acrid by the &s;ame cau&s;e, the <HI>enamel</HI> will be intirely con&s;umed. Whenever this di&s;order appears, it can be of no detriment, but to the parts that are not &s;ufficiently firm and o&s;&s;ified. Children that are infected <HI>in utero,</HI> with the &s;curvy, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, &amp;c. will bring along with them the &s;eeds of tho&s;e di&s;orders, &s;o per|nicious to the teeth, if proper means are not made u&s;e of to prevent it. But if the original cau&s;es &s;hall be thorough|ly eradicated, the milk teeth will only &s;uffer, and tho&s;e that &s;ucceed them will be found quite untouched.</P>
<P>In order to purify the con&s;titutions of &s;uch children, it will be nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="52" REF="59">to make u&s;e of tho&s;e means proper to produce a good chyle, and to correct the &s;tate of the juices, which is the province of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e to chu&s;e a good nur&s;e, who&s;e milk is not thick, for then it is not &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilated by the inflantile powers, nor too &s;erous, for then it wants the proper &s;ub|&s;tance, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to form a good nutritious juice, the want of which prevents bones from growing in their natural form.</P>
<P>The child &s;hould be kept in a good and pure air, and all occa&s;ions taken to give it due exerci&s;e in the arms of the nur&s;e, &amp;c. The&s;e are precautions that will prevent this di&s;order from af|fecting children. It is worth ob&s;erv|ing, that if the ero&s;ion happens to come after the child is wained, that is to &s;ay, when he is from two to &s;ix years of
<PB N="53" REF="60">age, a methodical way of living, proper food and good air, will be the means to prevent it. Many have thought, without rea&s;on, that this di&s;order could affect nothing but the body of the tooth, and that the root was not &s;u&s;ceptible of it. It is true that the roots do not appear &s;o rough and worm-eaten, as the body of the tooth, but &s;till they are &s;horter, more crook|ed, and of an imperfect form, which they could never get but from this tendency of the humours to <HI>ero&s;ion,</HI> or from the <HI>rickets,</HI> which is a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o fatal to children, and proceeds from the &s;ame cau&s;es as the <HI>ero&s;ion;</HI> it al&s;o proves very pernicious to the teeth, and all other bones.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>CARIES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As &s;oon as the teeth make their ap|pearance, the <HI>caries</HI> begin to attack them, and con&s;equently they &s;tand in need
<PB N="54" REF="61">of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance. One &s;hould think that their hardne&s;s would ren|der them le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of it, but they are even more &s;ubject to a <HI>caries</HI> than all other bones; it is ea&s;y how|ever to trace the cau&s;es of it. As teeth are of a clo&s;er texture, their ve&s;&s;els are more compre&s;&s;ed, and therefore ob&s;tructions are ea&s;ier occa&s;ioned, and al&s;o when cold happens to &s;trike them to a certain degree, or when the bony fibres &s;uffer by &s;ome extraor|dinary effort. If the juices that cir|culate through the &s;mall channels of the teeth, are too thick, or are any way vitiated, the teeth will therefore be more liable to be contaminated, but always in proportion to the impre&s;&s;ions they &s;hall receive.</P>
<P>Teeth that have been affected with the ero&s;ion, at the &s;ame time they were forming, are more &s;ubject to be
<PB N="55" REF="62">carious, on account of the bad con|dition of their ve&s;&s;els, and therefore are more difficultly pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Various are the &s;pecies of <HI>caries;</HI> almo&s;t every part of the teeth are affected by it, and both internal and external cau&s;es produce it. A <HI>caries</HI> may be divided into &s;oft, &s;uperficial, deep, and dry; it attacks the root, the <HI>neck</HI> or the <HI>crown</HI> of the teeth. The <HI>caries,</HI> that proceeds from internal cau&s;es, namely, the &s;curvy, &amp;c. <HI>generally</HI> affects the root of the tooth, often the internal &s;urface, &s;ometimes the exter|nal, and even the inward cavity of the body.</P>
<P>Such a <HI>caries</HI> is more difficult to be known, than that which proceeds from external cau&s;es, chiefly when it attacks the <HI>root</HI> or <HI>neck</HI> of the tooth; for as the former is buried in the
<PB N="56" REF="63">&s;ocket, and the latter is covered by the gums, one cannot perceive it, and therefore we can only conjecture, that there is a caries from the torturing pains that are produced; but the&s;e con|jectures are often fal&s;e; for the pain may proceed from &s;ome irritation af|fecting the <HI>cord</HI> of the tooth or the pe|rio&s;tium, that covers and lines the root; the con&s;quences therefore ari&s;ing from this &s;ort of caries are very bad, for it is mo&s;tly nece&s;&s;ary to draw the tooth it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The caries that proceeds from exter|nal cau&s;es, is vi&s;ible, and con&s;equently by admitting of the nece&s;&s;ary opera|tions, more ea&s;ily removed. A caries, the longer it is allowed to run on, the deeper it goes, and therefore the more difficult to cure.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="64">
<P>the &s;oft and dry caries are not dan|gerous, if their progre&s;s is quickly and properly &s;topt.</P>
<P>Every kind of caries is more difficult to be eradicated according to the place it affects in the tooth, as that renders the operation more or le&s;s difficult.</P>
<P>Although teeth begin to be affected with the caries, as &s;oon as they appear, &s;till it mu&s;t be allowed, that the time in which they are more &s;ubject to it, is from 25 to 50 yeare of age.</P>
<P>It is wroth remarking, that when a tooth is affected by the caries on that &s;ide which re&s;ts on another tooth, it al&s;o infects the contiguous one; for ex|perience daily &s;hews, that when the &s;pot begins to appear in one tooth, it is al&s;o &s;een, although not &s;o large on the next in the very &s;ame place; from which we may argue, that the particles
<PB N="58" REF="65">exhaling from the carious tooth mu&s;t be corro&s;ive; this happens, not only in the lateral, but al&s;o in the oppo&s;ite teeth; for when a caries appears on the upper &s;urface of a tooth, it is then ap|plied to the &s;urface of the oppo&s;ite, and in the &s;ame manner affects it, as is par|ticularly &s;een in the molares.</P>
<P>The caries &s;ometimes proceed from fractures in the teeth; but the&s;e are generally cau&s;ed by falls, and from vio|lent efforts in breaking &s;omething of a hard nature with the teeth.</P>
<P>The fractured tooth can never be re|paired, but however it ought not to be neglected, but carefully examined, as it requires the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, for the tooth has &s;ometimes in the fractured part &s;mall cutting points, that will be of great detriment to the tongue, and be the cau&s;e of very pain|ful and dangerous wounds; therefore
<PB N="59" REF="66">they mu&s;t be immediately taken off, to prevent mi&s;chief to the tender parts that they touch.</P>
<P>Whenever the <HI>caries</HI> appears, it mu&s;t be opened by a ma&s;terly hand to the very bottom; if in &s;o doing, the cord of the tooth is di&s;covered, the operation will prove very painful; but &s;till it mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, either with an in&s;trument, the actual cautery, or &s;ome cau&s;tic liquor.</P>
<P>We ought to be very attentive in the operation; for if we do not utterly de&s;troy the &s;aid cord, but only prick it, the mo&s;t raging pains will &s;ucceed, together with an inflammation, and the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of drawing the tooth.</P>
<P>Such a cure cannot but be very tor|turing, for not only the &s;en&s;itive parts of the tooth are to be expo&s;ed to the impre&s;&s;ion of the air, but al&s;o to be
<PB N="60" REF="67">touched with an in&s;trument, &s;o as to be entirely de&s;troyed. The &s;kilful ope|rator mu&s;t endeavour to a&s;&s;wage the pain of his patient by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of medicines.</P>
<P>When a tooth by the lo&s;s of its cord is become in&s;en&s;ible, it mu&s;t be filled with lead or gold, in order to prevent any acid or &s;aline particles from getting (through the hole, where the <HI>cord</HI> went) into the &s;ocket, to hurt its delicate membranes, for then there could be no means of redre&s;s, but by drawing the tooth; hence all the care that has been taken, and all the pain that had been endured to render the tooth in&s;en&s;ible, would then be of no avail.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>TARTAR.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Now we &s;hall proceed to treat of what is commonly called the Tartar. From whatever occa&s;ional or &s;econdary cau&s;e the tartar proceeds, the principal
<PB N="61" REF="68">one is certainly negligence. It hath been called by &s;ome a <HI>cancer,</HI> becau&s;e it corrodes the gums, and the &s;ocket in &s;uck a manner that the teeth will fall out for want of &s;upport. It is gene|rated by the fragments of aliments that &s;tick to the teeth, by a vitiated <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> or by an imperfect dige&s;tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Whenever this vi&s;cid matter is allow|ed to &s;tick to the teeth, it grows hard, and becomes the <HI>tartar,</HI> and it will augment by degrees, from new par|ticles of aliments continually joining the old ones; but this would never hap|pen if they were carefully cleaned every morning with &s;omething proper for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This tartar is a kind of a cru&s;t, not only di&s;agreeable to the eyes, but al&s;o productive of very foetid exhalations.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="69">
<P>There are various &s;orts of tartar, <HI>viz.</HI> The yellow, the whiti&s;h, the black, and even the green <HI>tartar,</HI> which is the mo&s;t pernicious, as it often de&s;|troys the enamel. The lower <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> are more &s;ubject to the <HI>tartar,</HI> chiefly in their internal &s;ide, becau&s;e of their vicinity to the tongue, and of the <HI>&s;a|liva</HI> which runs mo&s;tly that way; although per&s;ons grown in years are generally more liable to be troubled with the tartar; &s;till we frequent|ly &s;ee young people with their teeth all covered with it.</P>
<P>Whatever is the cau&s;e that pro|duces this tartar, or whatever the time of its appearance, it ought to be removed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, other|wi&s;e the gums, by the compre&s;&s;ion, will &s;well, and ob&s;truct the regular cour&s;e of the fluids through the <HI>lym|phatic</HI> and blood-ve&s;&s;els, which will therefore be liable to putrify, and de&s;|troy,
<PB N="63" REF="70">in a &s;hort time, the gum, the &s;ocket and <HI>perio&s;tium</HI> of the root.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on why teeth grow loo&s;e and painful; at that time, if you were even then to cut off this <HI>hetero|genous</HI> body, it would be too late to hinder the lo&s;s of the tooth, which is now left without any &s;upport from the gums, the <HI>perio&s;tium</HI> and the &s;ocket.</P>
<P>The tartar <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> is even thicker than the body of the tooth, to which it &s;ticks &s;o clo&s;e, that it &s;eems to form one &s;ingle body; therefore requires a dextrous and &s;kilful hand to remove it; in &s;uch a ca&s;e we mu&s;t endeavour to ren|der the cour&s;e of the humours free again to the gums, by re&s;toring them with proper a&s;tringent and anti&s;corbutic medicines.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="71">
<P>Some teeth, after having been freed of their tartar, will &s;hew a very beautiful enamel, which makes it evi|dent that &s;uch a <HI>tartar</HI> is not of an acrid or coro&s;ive nature as the green kind generally is.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>DISORDERS</HI> The Sockets are liable to.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ockets are al&s;o &s;ubject to caries as well as the teeth, although not &s;o often. The cau&s;es that produce &s;uch an effect in them, are the very &s;ame with the&s;e formerly delivered as the internal cau&s;e of caries in the teeth.</P>
<P>The &s;ockets are al&s;o liable to be de&s;troyed by degrees, in the &s;ame manner as the roots of the milk-teeth.</P>
<P>This fatal di&s;order proceeds from a &s;tagnation of humours in the gums, where they putrify, or from any &s;harp
<PB N="65" REF="72">and corro&s;ive particles, that may pene|trate and corrode them in&s;en&s;ibly, Al&s;o from a &s;tagnation of the fluids in the &s;erous or blood-ve&s;&s;els of the gums; the &s;ockets and their partitions will &s;ometimes grow &s;oft and become entire|ly of a fle&s;hy con&s;i&s;tence, which there|fore leaves the tooth without &s;upport. Old men generally lo&s;e their &s;ockets entirely, becau&s;e the nutritious juices that formerly &s;erved to nouri&s;h the gums are now no longer di&s;tributed to them.</P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving however, that per&s;ons of a robu&s;t con&s;titution are not &s;o liable to lo&s;e their &s;ockets, and con|&s;equently their teeth; for we &s;ee peo|ple extremely old with all their teeth, their gums quite perfect, and there|fore their &s;ockets mu&s;t be &s;ound and well.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="73">
<P>There is no other way to prevent tho&s;e di&s;orders, hut by taking a parti|cular care in cleaning the gums, never letting any corro&s;ive particles, or any vi&s;cid matter, that is likely to putrify, enter into the &s;ocket, &s;o that the gums may become &s;trong and apply them&s;elves clo&s;ely round the necks of the teeth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Di&s;orders of the <HI>GUMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Whenever the gums are affected, they generally lo&s;e their colour, their firmne&s;s, and con&s;equently their ad|herence to the teeth; they will at different times appear pale, flabby, re|laxed, rough, corroded, inflamed and wrinkled. The lividity of the gums proceeds from &s;ome defect in the cir|culation of the blood through them.</P>
<P>To remedy as much as po&s;&s;ible &s;o di&s;agreeable a circum&s;tance, it will be proper to rub the gums pretty often
<PB N="67" REF="74">in the morning, and likewi&s;e to &s;carify them in order to let out &s;ome blood, and in that way promote the circula|tion.</P>
<P>If after the&s;e means have been u&s;ed, the complaint remains the &s;ame, it will be the nece&s;&s;ary to have the phy|&s;ician's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as the fault mu&s;t be rooted in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The gums grow often &s;o thick that they in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble pin|cu&s;hions, and by communicating their &s;welling to the lips, they will greatly deform the mouth and face.</P>
<P>This di&s;order proceeds either from the compre&s;&s;ion of the tartar, or a local <HI>plethora.</HI> If it proceeds from the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the tartar mu&s;t be removed immediately, then &s;carify or prick the gums, and admini&s;ter proper anti&s;cor|butic and a&s;tringent medicines fit to brace them up.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="75">
<P>But if the &s;welling proceeds from a <HI>plethora,</HI> which is ea&s;ily known, a pro|per method mu&s;t be-taken to evacuate the vitiated humours, and to dimini&s;h the thickne&s;s of the gums, in the points that run in betwixt each tooth, where the &s;welling more manife&s;tly appears; then proper a&s;tringents &s;hould al&s;o be applied to prevent the complaint from recurring; the patient mu&s;t live on a proper regimen, and &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ary ablutions.</P>
<P>A &s;welling often as big as a &s;trawber|ry, &s;ometimes appears in the gums of young people, which is more un&s;ightly than dangerous; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The &s;ame cau&s;es that &s;well the gums, will al&s;o produce excre&s;cences upon them.</P>
<P>If the&s;e proceed from an external cau&s;e, the effect will cea&s;e when once it is removed; but where the cau&s;e is
<PB N="69" REF="76">internal, till once that is entirely re|moved, all outward applications will be u&s;ele&s;s; &s;ometimes the&s;e excre&s;cences will be greater than at other times.</P>
<P>When they begin, they are never dangerous, but if they are neglected and increa&s;e, the tooth becomes &s;oon loo&s;e, and of cour&s;e is &s;oon lo&s;t. Ab|&s;orbent remedies are to be applied in the beginning, but when the excre&s;|cence is arrived to a certain &s;ize, then it can't be de&s;troyed, but either by care|fully cutting off the redundant part of the gum, or by con&s;uming it &s;ome other way.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the gums may be dimini&s;hed either for want of &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment, or by being too ten&s;e and firm; for then they are apt to hinder the fluids from circulating properly; hence it happens that the teeth are de|prived of their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport, and
<PB N="70" REF="77">the gums become a very di&s;agreeable &s;ight to the eye. The want of juices, and the contracted &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els (which are the chief cau&s;es) may be removed, by means of proper emolients, &amp;c. which by relaxing the parts that were too ten&s;e and firm, will promote the dilatation of the ve&s;&s;els, and con|&s;equently the cour&s;e of the humours will be more free, and their quantity augmented.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not however delay the cure too long, for &s;ometimes art comes too late. The palene&s;s of the gums pro|ceeds from a deficiency of the globular part of the blood, which may be occa|&s;ioned likewi&s;e by the narrowne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els. It is ea&s;y, by rubbing the gums pretty often, to recall the blood, and con&s;equently re&s;tore to them their natural colour.</P>
<P>Whenever the gums are relaxed, and want that ten&s;ity and firmne&s;s which
<PB N="71" REF="78">is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their be|ing in a &s;ound &s;tate, various complaints are generally the con&s;equence, and therefore proper <HI>anti&s;corbutic</HI> a&s;tringents mu&s;t be made u&s;e of in time, to pre|vent and remedy &s;uch fatal di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The gums are &s;ometimes rough, as if &s;pread all over with little grains, like millet &s;eeds, under the &s;kin. The&s;e little tumours are hard and ugly, &s;ome|times will come to a &s;uppuration, and render the gums very painful; the&s;e are therefore to be prevented by apply|ing very &s;trong re&s;olvents, then we mu&s;t make u&s;e of detergents, and come by degrees to a&s;tringents.</P>
<P>Children who eat too much &s;ugar, or &s;weetmeats, generally have their gums corroded: <HI>Confectioners</HI> and <HI>Chy|mi&s;ts</HI> are &s;ubject to this di&s;order, be|cau&s;e the &s;aline and corro&s;ive particles, that fly from the &s;ugar and minerals,
<PB N="72" REF="79">affect their gums: This di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould by no means be neglected; and fir&s;t of all, the cau&s;e mu&s;t be removed; then the proper a&s;tringent and &s;weetning medicines mu&s;t be admini&s;tered, to puri|fy the ma&s;s of the blood; and it is very nece&s;&s;ary to ab&s;tain from every thing too &s;alt, &s;picy, high &s;ea&s;oned, or what el&s;e may render the blood acrid or &s;harp.</P>
<P>The inflammation of the gums pro|ceeds, for the mo&s;t part, from the im|pre&s;&s;ion of cold air: The belt remedy therefore is to keep them warm.</P>
<P>That the gums are al&s;o &s;ubject to cancerous tumours, from the above cau&s;es, evidently appears; and they &s;hould always be &s;peedily extirpated. Such a di&s;order mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a local affection that has proceeded from &s;ome glandular, or va&s;cular part of the gums being vitiated, together
<PB N="73" REF="80">with an internal or praedi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e in the habit; it requires, therefore, a very &s;erious and mature con&s;ideration before &s;uch a cure is undertaken, le&s;t we &s;hould hurry on to the operation too precipitately.</P>
<P>Sometimes ulcers will affect the gums, their external cau&s;es are rotten teeth, the tartar, violent falls, blows, vitiated &s;aliva, or any other injury offered to them.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy and vitiated humours are the internal cau&s;es, and therefore a ra|dical cure of the ulcers will never take place, except the&s;e are entirely got the better of.</P>
<P>They are &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s deep in the gums; when they are not deep, a&s;tringents and anti&s;corbuties may be of u&s;e; but when they are deep, they will even produce a &s;welling, and
<PB N="74" REF="81">an excre&s;cence in the gums; and there|fore we mu&s;t take care to cut off the &s;uperfluity, and follow the method that was mentioned when we &s;poke of tumours and excre&s;cences.</P>
<P>Ulcers are of different &s;orts, and vary greatly in their appearance, but as they always proceed from the above cau&s;es, (and the nature of this work will not allow of prolixity) it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>The <HI>abce&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>impo&s;thumes,</HI> that are formed in the gums, proceed, for the mo&s;t part, from &s;ome bad tooth, or from &s;ome tooth not drawn in time. Or they may proceed from the intem|perature of air, from &s;ome violent blow, &amp;c. as al&s;o from the extraction
<PB N="75" REF="82">of a tooth difficult to draw. When the <HI>cord</HI> of the tooth is left uncovered, either by a <HI>caries,</HI> or &s;ome other cau&s;e, it &s;wells and inflames, communicating the inflammation to the <HI>perio&s;tium</HI> that covers the root, and lines the &s;ocket and &s;ub&s;tance of the maxillary bones, then proceeds to the &s;ocket, and &s;o to the gums, where the abce&s;s is formed, from its being a much &s;ofter part: we mu&s;t not neglect to examine the tooth, and if we find it to be the cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be drawn immediately, even if there was a <HI>fluxion</HI> of humours upon the gums; for the corrupted matters that are &s;tagnated in that place, might be very pernicious to the contiguous bony &s;ub&s;tance: then we mu&s;t make u&s;e of tho&s;e remedies that are pre&s;crib|ed in &s;uch ca&s;es, in order to make a perfect cure; for if it was not &s;peedily done, it would prove de&s;tructive to the gums, the &s;ockets, and contiguous teeth.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="83">
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;es al&s;o will produce <HI>fi&s;tulas</HI> in the gums, which are more or le&s;s of a malignant nature.</P>
<P>In order to remove them, it will be proper to make u&s;e of the &s;ame things that were pre&s;cribed for the <HI>abce&s;&s;es,</HI> or of any thing el&s;e that the &s;kilful practitioner will find nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Little Cancers that appear &s;ome|times in the gums may de&s;troyed by a cau&s;tic: tho&s;e that ari&s;e from &s;ome internal cau&s;e, are more malignant and &s;tubborn, &s;ometimes they are very numerous and &s;mall, of colour different from other cancers, and almo&s;t always accompanied by ulcers &s;omewhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that proceed from the fluids being tainted by the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that ari&s;e
<PB N="77" REF="84">from a &s;corbutic humour; for the for|mer ones are deeper, more painful, and full of blood, yielding a greater quantity of foetid matter, and have their lips greatly &s;welled.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ones are of a milder nature, and are not &s;o much inflam|ed. Without purifying the vitiated humours internally, as was formerly hinted, all outward applications will be quite u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The gums are al&s;o &s;ubject to &s;up|puration, and in this way, not only the gums may be de&s;troyed, but al&s;o the teeth. I have remarked that fat per&s;ons are more &s;ubject to this di&s;order than tho&s;e of a meagre con&s;titution, on account of their having a greater quan|tity of humours; the fore parts of the <HI>inci&s;ores, canini,</HI> and &s;mall grinders,
<PB N="78" REF="85">towards the root, are mo&s;t liable to be affected with it; they grow of a browni&s;h colour, and in proportion as the di&s;order increa&s;es or decrea&s;es, they a&s;&s;ume a different appearance.</P>
<P>Suppuration frequently happens in tho&s;e gums where the &s;ockets are want|ing; the gum being, as well as the &s;ocket, dive&s;ted of the perio&s;tium, and con&s;equently not able to adhere, is, by being left to it&s;elf, and expo&s;ed to the air, or filled with &s;ome little ulcers that will &s;oon occa&s;ion &s;uppuration; and therefore it becomes nece&s;&s;ary (in order to avoid more dangerous con&s;equences) to cut off that piece of the gum which is left unattached, and likewi&s;e to remove all other cau&s;es, &s;uch as the &s;urcharge of humours, &amp;c. by exhibiting medicines that may be thoroughly adapted to an&s;wer that end.</P>
