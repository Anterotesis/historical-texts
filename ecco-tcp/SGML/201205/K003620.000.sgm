<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON PHYSICK.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL not trouble the Reader with the Occa&s;ion of the following E&s;&s;ay, or make any Apology for publi&s;hing it; the Subject of it is too Important to need the latter, and the former is a matter of no Con&s;equence to the Publick: and as I am not in humour, at pre&s;ent, to compliment either my Self or Others, and have neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to be Impertinent, I &s;hall directly fall on my Subject, without farther Preface or Dedication.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>'TIS a matter of Fact beyond di&s;pute in the Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ick, as far as we have any remaining Records of it, from its fir&s;t Ri&s;e to this Day, that the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> has &s;till grown more and more Bulky in every Age. From what Cau&s;es this aro&s;e, and what Effects it has produced, will be farther &s;een in the Cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t antient Phy&s;icians, as far as we can find, made u&s;e of but very few Reme|dies, and tho&s;e few were entirely directed to the natural Evacuations; either to pro|mote &s;uch as were Ob&s;tructed and Defec|tive, or to check and re&s;train &s;uch as were Exce&s;&s;ive and Redundant. And herein they exactly followed the Direction and Indica|tions of Nature, by ob&s;erving what Aug|mentation or Diminution of the&s;e Evacua|tions, brought on &s;uch and &s;uch morbid Symptoms, and by what ways and means they were removed and carried off, when the whole Proce&s;s was left to Nature only, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance or interpo&s;ition of Art. And as this was the only proper foundation to erect a laudable <HI>Praxis</HI> upon; &s;o in fact we find that the Medical Pro|ce&s;&s;es
<PB N="3" REF="4">of the Antients, were always more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, as they had a nearer or more remote relation, in their intention of Cure, to the Operations of una&s;&s;i&s;ted Na|ture, and were directed, governed and con|ducted by this Principle.</P>
<P>WHILE Men thus contented them&s;elves with knowing only what they could di&s;|cover in Fact, confined their Rea&s;onings to &s;uch Phaenomena as occurr'd by Observa|tion and Experience, and were not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s their Ignorance where they had no true Knowledge; they &s;tudyed Nature more &s;ucce&s;sfully, and applyed their Know|ledge to much better purpo&s;e: and Phy|&s;ick, as well as other Arts and Sciences, was con&s;iderably advanced and improved. But &s;uch was the Vanity of the Philo&s;o|phers in pretending to &s;earch into the real E&s;&s;ences, intrin&s;ick Con&s;titutions and formal Cau&s;es of things, that, in this whim&s;ical pur&s;uit, they had not only &s;et a&s;ide the true method of improving Knowledge by careful ob&s;ervation and ju&s;t experiments, but introduced into its room a chimerical <HI>Succedaneum,</HI> which had no foundation in
<PB N="4" REF="5">Rea&s;on and Nature, but was merely Fictiti|ous, Imaginary and Hypothetical. And thus while they thought to ran&s;ack the Bowels, and penetrate to the very Centre of Nature, they lo&s;t &s;ight of the Surface, and could not perceive or judge of what was before their Eyes.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e dark and profound Inqui&s;itors had confin'd their Enquirys and Lucubra|tions to matters of Speculation and Enter|tainment, and had not attempted to intrude their Whim&s;ys and Reveries into common Life, and the u&s;eful Arts and Sciences; tho' no good had come of it, yet, on the other hand, no great harm would have been done: but the mi&s;chief lay here, that in every Age the Philo&s;ophy mo&s;t in vogue, like a Tor|rent carry'd all before it, broke in upon Soul and Body at once, and &s;ettled not on|ly the Faith of Chri&s;tians, but the Practice of Phy&s;icians too: and hence we meet with in their turns <HI>Platoni&s;ts, Ari&s;totelians, Car|te&s;ians, Corpu&s;cularians, Specificians,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;icrucians</HI> in Phy&s;ick, as well as in Divi|nity. The&s;e all claimed the &s;ame implicit Faith and Obedience to their re&s;pective
<PB N="5" REF="6">Creeds, Canons and Con&s;titutions, equally denyed the Right of private Judgment to all their Di&s;ciples, and, as far as lay in their power, di&s;couraged and oppo&s;ed all rational Freedom of Inquiry what&s;oever. Thus a Phy&s;ical as well as Theological Orthodoxy was ever in&s;i&s;ted on, and a Man, in either ca&s;e, was always reputed to die a Heretick, if he did not die in Form.</P>
<P>THE State of Phy&s;ick thus &s;tood for ma|ny Ages, on the authority of the Schools and whim&s;ies of the Theori&s;ts. The &s;tudy of Nature was almo&s;t wholly laid a&s;ide, and the good old way to Knowledge by Ob&s;er|vations and Experiments, was &s;uper&s;eded by Canons and Aphori&s;ms founded on a meer verbal and unintelligible Philo&s;ophy; which from authority, only, obtain'd the name of fir&s;t Principles, and of con&s;equence were not to be di&s;puted. And hence we find that the Practice of Phy&s;ick in every &s;ucceeding Age became more and more uncertain and precarious, till it ran quite out of Character, and fell into the hands of Vi&s;ionaries and Chemical Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who being for the mo&s;t part Men of &s;trong
<PB N="6" REF="7">Imaginations and weak Judgments, em|ploy'd all their thoughts, and &s;pent all their time, in &s;earch after the <HI>Alkahe&s;t</HI> or <HI>Uni|ver&s;al Medicine;</HI> and &s;o eager were they in the pur&s;uit of this Chimaera, that they not only neglected, but almo&s;t quite lo&s;t, the little knowledge they had of particular Re|medies.</P>
<P>AND that a proper Theory might not be wanting exactly &s;uited to this whim&s;ical and ridiculous Enterprize; and finding it impracticable to adapt any one then in be|ing, or to contrive a new one in the way of Rea&s;on and Nature; they wi&s;ely took it into their heads to introduce Machinery into Medicine, and to bring in Demons and &s;upernatural Agents to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus the <HI>Archaeus</HI> came into play and was con|&s;tituted Superintendant over the whole A|nimal Oeconomy. This <HI>Major-Domo,</HI> as long as he was in good humour, executed his Commi&s;&s;ion very faithfully, and guarded the Health and Safety of the whole Body; &s;o that all Danger was prevented, and every thing went on well. But no &s;ooner was he di&s;plea&s;ed and di&s;obliged, but he neglected
<PB N="7" REF="8">his guard, Di&s;ea&s;e broke in upon the Con|&s;titution, and all was out of order; and no|thing in Nature could re&s;tore it again to its former Health and Rectitude, till the <HI>Ar|chaeus</HI> was pacifyed and appea&s;ed with the grand Secret or univer&s;al Medicine. Now this grand Secret, you mu&s;t know, was a certain Chemical Preparation &s;o exactly &s;uit|ed to his Ta&s;te, that it never fail'd, when timely admini&s;tred by the Phy&s;ician, to an|&s;wer this intention: but when this peevi&s;h te&s;ty Phantom happened to be neglected too long, he then fell into a pa&s;&s;ion, became implacable, and in his rage and fury always de&s;troyed the Patient.</P>
<P>THIS Scheme, as whim&s;ical and vi&s;iona|ry as it appears to be, has had for its Patrons and Defenders Gentlemen of the greate&s;t name; and I make no doubt but long e'er this time, &s;ome happy Genius or other in the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick way would have carried this matter, if po&s;&s;ible, into farther Fanati|ci&s;m, had not Mathematical and Mechani|cal Learning, which began to be in fa&s;hion in the la&s;t Age, put People on a better me|thod of enquiry and a ju&s;ter way of rea&s;on|ing.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<P>And yet notwith&s;tanding, &s;uch is the prodigious and almo&s;t in&s;uperable force of Prejudice and Education, that a great part of this Scheme is &s;till retained, by Gentle|men who would think them&s;elves ill u&s;ed if their Mathematical or Mechanical Know|ledge &s;hould be called in que&s;tion, under the <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> notion of to whom they have a&s;&s;igned much the &s;ame Province and Powers, as was done to the <HI>Archaeus</HI> before; with this additional ab&s;urdity, that the&s;e <HI>A|nimal Spirits</HI> have been treated as mecha|nical and intelligent Agents at the &s;ame time: of which any one may be convinced, who &s;hall think it worth his while to look into and examine the &s;everal Hypothe&s;es on this Subject.</P>
<P>AND tho' it mu&s;t be owned, that great advances and improvements have been &s;ince made, by the Moderns, in natural Know|ledge, yet 'tis much to be wi&s;h'd that a bet|ter method had been taken in the applica|tion of this to the Animal Oeconomy, the Practice of Phy&s;ick, and the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es. But &s;uch has been the hard fate of this Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, that amid&s;t all other advances Phy|&s;ick
<PB N="9" REF="10">has been &s;o very little improved, that we have but one <HI>Book</HI> in the World, as far as I know, wherein any general Attempt has been made to apply the true Philo&s;ophy of Nature to the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> and the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> and this in my opi|nion has been executed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s by the Ingenious Author of <HI>the Philo|&s;ophical Principles of Medicine,</HI> that the Intelligent unprejudiced Reader may pro|mi&s;e him&s;elf to meet, therein, with almo&s;t every thing that is valuable in the <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of Phy&s;ick; erected into one con&s;i&s;tent Sy&s;tem, founded on indi&s;putable Principles, and judiciou&s;ly drawn out into all its u&s;eful Corollaries and Con&s;equences. Nay, 'tis a Truth but too plain in fact, that in general we are much declined from the more &s;imple and natural methods of cure made u&s;e of by the <HI>Antients;</HI> and as this has been chiefly owing to our neglecting the true rational Indications and Intentions of Cure, &s;o in&s;tead of applying to this as Nature would direct us, we have been, and &s;till are, continually amu&s;ed with an infinite jumble of Medicines under the notion of <HI>Specifick</HI> Alteratives; as if, by a mo&s;t unac|countable and unintelligible Tran&s;mutation,
<PB N="10" REF="11">the morbid Matter could be converted into good Blood and Humours, and retain'd in the Body without injury to the Con&s;titu|tion; and there were no need at all of throwing it off by any of the natural Eva|cuations. Which idle Conceit is without doubt the Bane of all rational Practice, and the common Cheat by which <HI>Quacks, Empyricks</HI> and Ignorant Pretenders, chow&s;e and dupe People out of their Money and Lives.</P>
<P>Now in order to &s;hew the Folly and Ab|&s;urdity of this Notion, and to contribute what lies in my power towards reviving the more natural and rational Practice of the <HI>Antients,</HI> I &s;hall in this E&s;&s;ay, under di&s;tinct Sections, con&s;ider the principal Ope|rations of Medicines, and the manner in which they Act; end herein I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to &s;uch <HI>Simples</HI> as are mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in Practice, with due allow|ance for &s;ome choice of things, in the &s;ame general Intention, for the better accommo|dation of them to the Stomach and parti|cular liking of the Patient: avoiding as much as po&s;&s;ible all &s;uch philo&s;ophical Spe|culations, as have the lea&s;t tendency to lead
<PB N="11" REF="12">me be&s;ide my De&s;ign, or to draw me into any Con&s;iderations or Enquiries, concerning them, beyond their obvious <HI>&s;en&s;ible Quali|ties</HI> and <HI>Effects;</HI> which, in my opinion, is the true Boundary of all medicinal Know|ledge, and the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of the Phy&s;i|cians Empire.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> Of Animal Mechani&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be impo&s;&s;ible to give any ra|tional Account of Di&s;ea&s;es and their Cure, without a general knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy and the Method of Nature in preparing, dige&s;ting and &s;ecre|ting the &s;everal Liquors of the Glands, and the principal ends and u&s;es for which they are intended. And as this can only be known by a careful ob&s;ervation of Facts and the method of Nature either in pre|&s;erving Health, or in the Formation and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, where there has been no Interpo&s;ition of Art, and no Rea&s;onings <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> or antecedent to the Facts them|&s;elves: &s;o it is no wonder that the Theo|ri&s;ts
<PB N="12" REF="13">in all Ages, who deviated from this good old way of the <HI>Antients,</HI> and &s;et out with other Views and on other Principles, bewildered them&s;elves and their Followers, and never arrived at any one point of real and u&s;eful Knowledge, or made the lea&s;t Advance or Improvement in the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Healing.</HI></P>
<P>THE mo&s;t antient Phy&s;icians, who were always the be&s;t Philo&s;ophers of their time, grounded their Curative Intentions, upon the mo&s;t obvious and &s;en&s;ible Effects of Medicines, as they either promoted or re|&s;trained this or the other natural Evacua|tion, and thereby corrected any &s;uch Error either in Exce&s;s or Defect. And this mo&s;t obvious and &s;en&s;ible Effect, vi&s;ible to all By-&s;tanders or Ob&s;ervers, they called the <HI>Virtue, Power</HI> or <HI>Property</HI> of the Medi|cine; and herein they never expected or promi&s;ed any &s;en&s;ible Effect in the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, from in&s;en&s;ible or unknown Cau|&s;es; or, which is the &s;ame thing, they were not let into the My&s;tery of our Modern <HI>Specifick</HI> or <HI>Corpu&s;culariau</HI> Philo&s;ophy; they did not under&s;tand the Magick of
<PB N="13" REF="14">Curing Di&s;ea&s;es, by <HI>Occult Qualities</HI> in Medicines, or of producing &s;en&s;ible Effects without &s;en&s;ible Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT our Modern Writers upon Phy&s;ick and the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, have for the mo&s;t part inverted this Order of Nature, by a mo&s;t ungeometrical and immechani|cal Application of Geometry and Mecha|ni&s;m, to the Animal Structure and Oeco|nomy: And not a few of the great Ma&s;ters and Leaders of the Faculty, have either made their own <HI>Data,</HI> a&s;&s;umed fal&s;e Prin|ciples without Proofs, or rea&s;oned Illogi|cally, by drawing fal&s;e Con&s;equences from real Facts and ju&s;t Principles. Of this I &s;hall give &s;ome very pregnant and convinc|ing In&s;tances, that I may not be thought to talk at random, or to lay in a Charge again&s;t our Modern <HI>Medico</HI>-Philo&s;ophers without Ground or Rea&s;on: for tho' I love Truth, yet I hate any thing that looks like Malice and Defamation, and had much ra|ther be convicted of Ignorance than Di&s;ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN the <HI>Antients</HI> had ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;mall parts of &s;ome &s;orts of mat|ter,
<PB N="14" REF="15">would attract and intimately unite or Incorporate with each other; while the Particles of other &s;ort of matter, would naturally &s;eparate and di&s;unite, and could not ea&s;ily be Incorporated at all. Thus they ob&s;erv'd that the Particles of <HI>Salts</HI> would readily di&s;&s;olve in, and intimately mix and incorporate with <HI>Water,</HI> tho' they are Spe|cifically heavier; and that <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Sul|phurs</HI> would not do &s;o, but, on the con|trary, di&s;unite, &s;eparate and repel each o|ther, whatever their different Specifick Gra|vities might be.</P>
<P>THEY ob&s;erv'd likewi&s;e in the Animal Body, that the &s;everal parts to be &s;upply'd and nouri&s;h'd, would attract, imbibe and retain their proper Nutritive Matter, and repel or drive on any other &s;ort of Mat|ter, not fit for &s;uch a purpo&s;e; and the&s;e different Powers or Properties, in the &s;e|veral &s;orts of Matter which they ob&s;erv'd to be &s;o obvious and vi&s;ible to the Sen&s;es, they call'd <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>Antipathy,</HI> with|out knowing the Cau&s;es of it, or &s;o much as pretending to rea&s;on from it <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI> And here therefore they could mean no
<PB N="15" REF="16">more by it, than we do by <HI>Centripetal</HI> and <HI>Centrifugal Forces,</HI> or the mutual <HI>Attracti|on</HI> and <HI>Repul&s;ion</HI> of the &s;everal parts of Matter. The mo&s;t antient Philo&s;ophers and Phy&s;icians therefore had as clear and di&s;tinct Ideas of their <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>Anti|pathy,</HI> and under&s;tood what they meant by it, as well as we do the <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Vis Inertiae</HI> of Bodies in general, the <HI>Ela&s;tici|ty</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> or the <HI>Pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of <HI>Fluids,</HI> and the different degrees of <HI>Attraction</HI> in Bo|dies. And, 'tis more than probable, were the&s;e Gentlemen now living, and ask'd to explain them&s;elves on this Subject, that they might tell us they would a&s;&s;ign the Cau&s;es of what they called <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>Antipa|thy,</HI> as &s;oon as we had explained and a&s;|&s;igned the Cau&s;es of any of the other Facts and &s;en&s;ible Appearances before mentioned; and that till we could do this, we &s;hould in reality be no wi&s;er than they.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be own'd that this Doctrine was afterwards very much corrupted and abu&s;ed, and apply'd to a thou&s;and Ca&s;es, where it could have no place, as the <HI>Peri|patetick Philo&s;ophy</HI> grew into Vogue, and
<PB N="16" REF="17">came to be more and more celebrated in the <HI>Schools.</HI> For in this Philo&s;ophy, <HI>Words</HI> were never intended to &s;ignify any real Facts, Appearances or <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in Na|ture, but only the unknown Cau&s;es, or internal Con&s;titutions of Things. This in|deed was a &s;hort way of talking, about every thing known or unknown, but a round-about way to Knowledge, as it ne|ver produced any. But as this cannot affect the more antient Phy&s;icians and Philo&s;o|phers, or tho&s;e who lived after <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s time who &s;till built their Knowledge of Nature upon Ob&s;ervation, Experiment and Fact, as much as if no &s;uch Philo&s;opher had ever been born; &s;o it is certain that no other real Improvement of natural Know|ledge has ever been made, or ever can be made, on any other Plan what&s;oever.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Antients</HI> were mi&s;taken, it was generally owing to want of clearer Facts or <HI>Data</HI> to rea&s;on upon; but the Moderns, by wrong Rea&s;oning upon Facts, and drawing fal&s;e Con&s;equences from <HI>Things</HI> given, have run into more and gro&s;&s;er Errors, than had ever been known before. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t <HI>Antient Phy|&s;icians</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="18">were very good <HI>Modern Philo&s;o|phers,</HI> in every thing relating to their <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,</HI> whatever they might be as to other parts of Nature; while the Generality of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> tho' very good Philo&s;ophers in other Re&s;pects, are yet, with regard to the Medical Art, in &s;pite of all the <HI>New|tonian</HI> Principles and Di&s;coveries, down|right <HI>Atomi&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Ari&s;totelians.</HI></P>
<P>THE Antients knew nothing of the Cir|culation of the Blood, from the Heart thro' the Arteries and back again by the return|ing Veins; nor of the particular Ducts thro' which part of the Chyle is conveyed from the Stomach to the Subclavian Veins. But the Moderns having made the&s;e Di&s;co|veries, let us con&s;ider &s;ome of the Fruits of it, and the Con&s;equences they have drawn from it.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Blood,</HI> as a Fact given, it has been commonly con|cluded, that the Action of the Heart, in its alternate <HI>Sy&s;tole</HI> and <HI>Dia&s;tole,</HI> is the whole Force and adequate Power, by which the Blood is moved in the cour&s;e of its Circu|lation.
<PB N="16" REF="19"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="17" REF="20"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="18" REF="21">Knowing therefore that the Blood Circulates, and pre&s;uming that the Heart is the moving Force or Power, this Power has been exactly computed, at a great ex|pence of Geometry and Mechani&s;m. And herein the Gentlemen, who have applyed them&s;elves to this, have &s;ucceeded &s;o well and come &s;o near together, that they have differed only about the Force of the Heart, in the proportion of 500000 to I; for this, upon a ju&s;t Computation, will be found to be nearly the Difference, between Dr. <HI>James Keil,</HI> and the famous <HI>Borelli</HI> in his Book <HI>de Motu Animalium.</HI> But in the mean while, might it not be as well to be quite ignorant of the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Blood,</HI> as not to be able to apply it to better Pur|po&s;e? Did not the Antients <HI>Bleed,</HI> when occa&s;ion required, before they knew any thing at all of the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Blood?</HI> Nay, did they not u&s;e <HI>Phlebotomy</HI> with more Judgment and Succe&s;s, by opening a Vein as near as po&s;&s;ible to the Part affected; while the Moderns have ab&s;urdly run into the contrary Practice, again&s;t Fact and Ex|perience, as well as the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things; by fal&s;ly concluding that 'twould
<PB N="19" REF="22">be indifferent from what part of the Body Blood &s;hould be drawn, &s;ince, in con&s;e|quence of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> the <HI>Aequilibri|um</HI> of the Vital Fluid would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;oon re&s;tored again. Or has the Knowledge of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> by any U&s;e or Applica|tion whatever that has yet been made of it, at all improved the Art of Healing?</P>
<P>BUT farther, from the Di&s;covery of the <HI>Chyliferous Ducts,</HI> which terminate chiefly in the left Subclavian Vein, tho' they are often found in the Right too, it has been concluded that the whole quantity of Chyle, and every thing that can be conveyed from the Stomach thro' the Lacteals, mu&s;t pa&s;s <HI>this way</HI> into the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els; and that this <HI>Matter</HI> mu&s;t afterwards be derived a|gain from the Blood in the Arteries, by the Glandular Secretory Ducts, before there can be any &s;uch thing as <HI>Animal Nutrition</HI> or <HI>Evacuation.</HI> But as this is contrary to all the Phaenomena of <HI>Animal Nature,</HI> and demon&s;tratively fal&s;e in Fact, it could not po&s;&s;ibly have ever entered into the Heads of Men, who had not had the va&s;t advan|tage of <HI>Modern Di&s;coverys</HI> in Phy&s;ick.</P>

<P>ANY Man, I think, who has made the lea&s;t reflection upon this Matter, if not too &s;trongly prejudiced, or accu&s;tomed to ano|ther way of thinking, mu&s;t be convinced that the <HI>Natural Evacuations,</HI> in their in|crea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed Quantities, do not at all follow the Laws and Conditions of the <HI>Sanguineous Circulation,</HI> or the increa&s;ed or dimini&s;h'd Velocity and <HI>Momentum</HI> of the Blood; but that one may be increa&s;ed while the other is dimini&s;hed, and pro|duce their Effects reciprocally. In Inflam|matory and Effluent <HI>Fevers,</HI> where the Ve|locity and <HI>Impetus</HI> of the Blood is greate&s;t, the natural Secretions and Evacuations are generally greatly dimini&s;h'd. And, on the contrary, in the Paroxi&s;ms of <HI>Diabetical, Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;terick</HI> Di&s;orders, we often find a very great and extraordi|nary <HI>Profluvium</HI> of Urine, where the Cir|culation of the Blood is very low and lan|guid, or almo&s;t quite &s;u&s;pended; which could not po&s;&s;ibly happen, I think, if the&s;e Evacuations were made from the <HI>Arterial Blood,</HI> and depended on the Velocity and <HI>Impetus</HI> of that Fluid.</P>

<P>IN <HI>Atrophys</HI> we frequently &s;ee People, running off all their Fle&s;h, till they are reduced to mere Skin and Bones, and yet the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els remain &s;till full and turgid, and the Blood, upon opening a Vein, comes off with &s;ufficient Force and Freedom, and there are no Symptoms, or Indications at all, of any Diminution or Defect of that Fluid.</P>
<P>IN a <HI>Drop&s;y</HI> every thing that is drank, or taken in of a fluid Nature, fills up and di&s;tends the Ventricles of the Glands, the Lymphatick Ducts, and Membranous Cells throughout the Body &s;till more and more; while the quantity of Blood, upon the whole, is not at all increa&s;ed, but ra|ther much le&s;&s;ened and dimini&s;hed: And <HI>Bleeding,</HI> in this Ca&s;e, is &s;o far from le&s;&s;en|ing or abating any &s;uch Glandular, Lympha|tick or Membranous <HI>Plethora,</HI> that, on the contrary, it rather increa&s;es, &s;trengthens and confirms it: And farther, in this Ca&s;e &s;uch a <HI>Plethora,</HI> or Redundancy of Water, may be all drawn off, and di&s;charg'd by <HI>Urine, Stools, Sweating,</HI> &amp;c. without affecting
<PB N="22" REF="25">or altering the State of the Blood, &s;o far as can be di&s;covered, either as to its Quantity or Quality.</P>
<P>THESE Facts; and Ob&s;ervations, to men|tion no more, are I think &s;ufficient to de|mon&s;trate, that there is no &s;uch Intercour&s;e and Communication between the Glands and Membranous Cells and the Blood, as is commonly Imagined; and that a Defect, or Redundancy, may happen in either inde|pendent of each other, and con&s;equently that tho&s;e Lacteals, which convey a certain portion of the Chyle from the Stomach, to be emptyed into the <HI>Blood-Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> may receive either more or le&s;s than their &s;hare, as well as tho&s;e which are to carry off and convey the &s;ame to the <HI>Brea&s;ts, Kidneys, Cutaneous Ducts, &amp;c.</HI> and this indepen|dent on each other, as the Recipients, lead|ing to one part or the Other, may either be too <HI>Lax</HI> and <HI>Open,</HI> or too much <HI>Con|&s;tringed</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;tructed.</HI> And from hence it is, that we find &s;ome Per&s;ons and Con|&s;titutions very much inclined and di&s;po&s;ed to collect and accumulate Blood, while they are &s;till <HI>Thin</HI> and <HI>Lean</HI> in Fle&s;h; and others to
<PB N="23" REF="26">grow <HI>Fat</HI> and <HI>Fle&s;hy,</HI> with a Scarcity and Defect of Blood at the &s;ame time.

<P>ANOTHER modern Di&s;covery in Phy|&s;ick, as a Con&s;equence of the former, is this, That there is no &s;uch thing as different <HI>Fermentations, Dige&s;tions,</HI> and <HI>Separations</HI> of <HI>Liquors</HI> in the Ventricles of the Glands, from different Degrees of <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Mo|tion;</HI> but that all the variety of the different Secretions, is effected by a &s;imple <HI>Colature</HI> from the Arterial Blood, thro' &s;mall Pipes of different Diameters, and which will ad|mit of Fluid Particles of one Size, but not of another, without any <HI>Glandular Con|coction</HI> what&s;oever. Now if any body had a mind to look like a <HI>Mechanician</HI> and <HI>Chemi&s;t,</HI> without being one the <HI>Bel|linian</HI> Doctrine, would &s;oon furni&s;h him with Words that might &s;ound very well;
<PB N="24" REF="27">and a Man who is well ver&s;ed in that <HI>Hy|pothe&s;is,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be thought a con&s;i|derable Philo&s;opher, while he is talking the greate&s;t and mo&s;t egregious Non&s;en&s;e in the World.

<P>THE Antients, tho' they had not the u&s;e of <HI>Micro&s;copes,</HI> the Method of <HI>Injecting</HI> the <HI>Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> and &s;everal other Helps with

Which is ju&s;t as good Sen&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="30">as if any one &s;hould a&s;&s;ign the Weight, Spring, or <HI>Moving Force,</HI> applyed to the Wheels, or Pullies, as the Cau&s;e of the Mo|tion of a Clock, Watch, Crane, or other <HI>Machine,</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;uppo&s;e the Motion of the <HI>Engine,</HI> to be the Cau&s;e of the Weight, Spring, or <HI>Moving Force.</HI> But this, notwith&s;tanding all the expence of Geometry and Mechani&s;m that has been laid out upon it, by its great <HI>Patrons</HI> and Defenders, and its being &s;o generally re|ceiv'd on their <HI>Authority,</HI> as a fir&s;t Princi|ple in Phy&s;ick, is an evident Impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and be&s;t Philo&s;ophers and Phy|&s;icians, who apply'd them&s;elves to the Stu|dy of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> by ob&s;erving the great Alteration made upon our com|mon Food, by <HI>Fermentation</HI> and <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> in the Stomach, whereby a Liquor was prepared to be afterwards farther conveyed to the &s;everal Parts of the Body, while the Excrementitious Indige&s;tible Parts of the Aliment were &s;eparated, forced forward, and thrown out of the Body, carryed this Rea&s;oning, by Analogy of Nature, to the other Glands and Ventricles of the Body, where they &s;uppo&s;ed a farther <HI>Concoction</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="31">might, in like manner, be made and diffe|rent Liquors prepared and &s;eparated, under different Degrees of <HI>Dige&s;tive Heat</HI> and <HI>Motion,</HI> &s;o as to an&s;wer the &s;everal Ends and Purpo&s;es of the <HI>Animal Con&s;titution.</HI> And herein they argued right, and grounded their Principles upon the true Method and Oeconomy of Nature in all other like Ca&s;es. But how far the Moderns have mended this Theory, or any other practical Principle of the Antients, by any of the foregoing <HI>Hypothe&s;es,</HI> or by their clearer Knowledge of Anatomy, I may leave any one to judge.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides the Virtues, Properties or &s;en&s;ible Effects of Medicines, as they vi&s;ibly promoted or re&s;trained this or the other natural Evacuation, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful Students of this part of Nature, had another Cla&s;s of <HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> in things given, as they vi&s;ibly and &s;en&s;ibly affected the <HI>Animal Con&s;titution,</HI> with re|gard to the Primary or <HI>Elementary Quali|ties,</HI> as they cho&s;e to call them, of <HI>Heat Cold, Moi&s;ture</HI> and <HI>Dryne&s;s.</HI> Or which is the &s;ame thing, as Things given, whether
<PB N="29" REF="32">a Medicine or Diet, were found to <HI>Heat</HI> or <HI>Cool, Moi&s;ten</HI> or <HI>Dry</HI> the Solids in ge|neral. And upon this they founded their Notion of the four Principal Primary or Elementary Con&s;titutions of <HI>Hot</HI> and <HI>Dry, Hot</HI> and <HI>Moi&s;t, Cold</HI> and <HI>Dry,</HI> and <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Moi&s;t.</HI> Where the&s;e primary Elemen|tary Qualities were found to be &s;o equally mix'd and contemperated, as that any one of them did not abound or prevail again&s;t the re&s;t, this was called the <HI>Natural Tem|perature</HI> or State of Health; For while the&s;e <HI>Elementary Qualities</HI> were duly tempered and equally blended together, the Body remain'd Sound and Well, and performed all its Functions regularly and in good Order; and no Di&s;ea&s;e or Di&s;tem|perature could ever be ob&s;erv'd, but upon the Prevalency of &s;ome one, or more, of the&s;e Qualities above the others: And from hence in every Di&s;ea&s;e the prevailing Humours were di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Blood, Phlegm, Choler</HI> or <HI>Bile,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy</HI> or <HI>Black Bile:</HI> and the general Con&s;titu|tions were from thence denominated, either <HI>Sanguine, Phlegmatick, Cholorick,</HI> or <HI>Me|lancholy,</HI> as this or that Humour prevail'd
<PB N="30" REF="33">or had the A&s;cendency in particular Per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>Now this, I think, is plain Sen&s;e and talking very Intelligibly; and the Moderns, who have found out other <HI>Hypothe&s;es,</HI> better Methods of Rea&s;oning in Phy&s;ick, and nearer Ways to Health, as the <HI>Event</HI> has plainly prov'd, cannot pretend to be Ignorant of what the Antients meant by <HI>Blood, Phlegm, Choler</HI> or <HI>Bile,</HI> tho' they have been mightily puzzled to know what was under&s;tood and intended by their Me|lancholick Humour or <HI>Black Bile.</HI> And yet he who does not under&s;tand this, mu&s;t either never have practi&s;ed Phy&s;ick, or el&s;e never have made any Ob&s;ervations and Re|flections on what he has &s;een and met with in Practice. For, in my Opinion, 'tis extreamly clear that the antient Phy&s;icians neither did, nor could, under&s;tand any thing el&s;e, by their <HI>Melancholia</HI> or <HI>Bilis Atra,</HI> but the Bile corrupted, vitiated, and dege|nerated from its natural State and U&s;e; in which ca&s;e it always turns <HI>Black,</HI> and be|comes a peccant di&s;tempered Humour. It is true, indeed, that all the Humours by
<PB N="31" REF="34">Stagnation, Corruption and Fermentation, may change their Original Colours and Qualities, as well as the <HI>Bile,</HI> which was as well known to the Antients as to the Mo|derns, and taken notice of by them accord|ingly; but yet this <HI>Corrupt Bile,</HI> when it prevails, is &s;o very exten&s;ive in its Con&s;e|quences, and productive of &s;o many and great Di&s;ea&s;es, even where no <HI>Jaundice</HI> en&s;ues, that it was ju&s;tly taken notice of and di&s;tingui&s;hed, by them, as one of the Principal General <HI>Morbid Con&s;titutions:</HI> And e&s;pecially, as this Di&s;temperature of the Bile naturally, and almo&s;t con&s;tantly, at|tends a <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Dry</HI> State and Habit of Body, or a prevalency of Cold and Dryne&s;s, above Heat and Moi&s;ture, in the General Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I am aware &s;ome trifling Objections may be made to what I have advanced here; but as they would all terminate in this, that the Antients could not always expre&s;s them&s;elves accurately enough to be under|&s;tood by the Moderns; &s;o in an&s;wer to them, without mentioning the particular Objections, it may be only &s;aid in general,
<PB N="32" REF="35">that the Moderns, in this Ca&s;e, have been equally culpable, in that they have not been always able to expre&s;s them&s;elves, with &s;ufficient Clearne&s;s, to be under&s;tood by one another. But for any one gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity, or Fal&s;hood in Fact, which any Man &s;hall produce from the <HI>Antients,</HI> a|bout the Cau&s;e, Formation and Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es; I will undertake, in defence of the <HI>Moderns</HI> upon this Article, to give him five.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Antients</HI> had, indeed, a particular Notion that the <HI>Blood</HI> is made in the <HI>Li|ver,</HI> to which <HI>Vi&s;cus</HI> they a&s;cribed the Act of <HI>Sanguification.</HI> This Opinion has been perhaps ju&s;tly rejected by the Moderns, tho' they have not been able yet to &s;ettle any thing in the room of it; and therefore have had no ground for the Laugh. The An|tients, it &s;eems, fell into this Mi&s;take for want of a clearer Knowledge of Anatomy. Well, be it &s;o; but how have the Moderns rectified this Error, by their farther Di&s;co|veries, and better Acquaintance with the A|nimal Structure and Oeconomy; or to what particular <HI>Organ</HI> do they a&s;cribe this
<PB N="33" REF="36">Act of Sanguification? Perhaps it may be an&s;wered, with &s;ome Triumph here, that the Ca&s;e is now very plain, and that &s;ince the Di&s;covery of the <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of the Air, 'tis evident enough that the <HI>Lungs</HI> are the only proper Sanguifying Organs; where, by the Intromi&s;&s;ion of a fine <HI>Ela&s;tick Au|ra,</HI> the&s;e Globules are form'd and blown up. But this is a very &s;trange Account of the Matter, indeed, &s;ince 'tis certain, in Fact, that the&s;e <HI>Globules</HI> are &s;pecifically heavier, in&s;tead of being lighter than the <HI>Serum.</HI> And con&s;equently, that they cannot be Ve&s;icles or Bubbles fill'd and blown up with Air. And had one therefore a mind to maintain the Argument, for the &s;ake of the Je&s;t, it would be no great difficulty, in my Opini|on, to defend the <HI>Liver</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Lungs,</HI> in &s;pite of all &s;uch Rea&s;onings as this.</P>
<P>BUT he who would follow the Gui|dance of Nature, and build his Opinion herein on plain Facts and Ob&s;ervations, may perhaps &s;ee Rea&s;on to conclude, that the Act of <HI>Sanguification</HI> is not appro|priated to any particular <HI>Vi&s;cus</HI> or Bowel,
<PB N="34" REF="37">that the <HI>Lungs</HI> contribute only their &s;hare in the Operation, and that the Blood re|ceives its peculiar Type and Form in the <HI>Arteries,</HI> where it undergoes the highe&s;t Degrees of <HI>Heat, Impetus</HI> and <HI>Motion.</HI></P>
<P>FOR we may ob&s;erve, in Old People, where the natural Heat, and Ela&s;tick Tone of the Solids are much impaired, that the Blood grows paler, fainter, and runs more into Water, and that the Globular Part or <HI>Cremor</HI> &s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ens in proportion to the <HI>Serum.</HI> And this likewi&s;e is remarka|bly the Ca&s;e in a <HI>Chloro&s;is,</HI> or, indeed, any Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Men&s;trual Secretion</HI> at|tended with <HI>Chilline&s;s, Lowne&s;s, Pallor</HI> and <HI>Languor:</HI> In which Ca&s;es we often &s;ee the <HI>Globules</HI> almo&s;t lo&s;t, and the Blood is little el&s;e but <HI>Serum.</HI> But, by re&s;toring the natural Heat, and &s;trengthning the Ela&s;|tick Tone of the Arteries, the&s;e Globules &s;oon ri&s;e again, and the <HI>Cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> or <HI>Cremor</HI> is reduced to its natural and due State, whether this be done by any Inter|nal Means or External only.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="38">
<P>THUS it may likewi&s;e be ob&s;erved, that People of <HI>Hot, Bilio&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Sanguine</HI> Con|&s;titutions, who&s;e Fibres are more firm and ten&s;e, and where con&s;equently the mu&s;|cular Force and Action of the Solids is &s;tronger and more vigorous, than in other <HI>Temperaments,</HI> have proportionally more <HI>Cremor</HI> in the Blood than others; and, in &s;ome high Inflammatory <HI>Fevers,</HI> where the Ela&s;tick Force of the Solids is &s;till greater and more exalted, the Blood becomes almo&s;t all <HI>Cremor,</HI> and affords but very little <HI>Se|rum</HI> after it has &s;tood many Hours in a cold Place. Now, from the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, to mention no more at pre&s;ent, it may perhaps be ju&s;tly concluded, that the Blood receives this Form from the Heat and Ela|boration it undergoes in the Arteries.</P>
<P>BUT to re&s;ume and con&s;ider a little far|ther the natural Con&s;titutions, as depend|ing on the Primary or <HI>Elementary Quali|ties</HI> above mentioned, it may be proper to take notice, that the true alterative Method of the Antients, con&s;i&s;ted in regulating and moderating the&s;e natural Con&s;titutions and primary Qualities. And this they did not
<PB N="36" REF="39">pretend to do by <HI>Specifick Alteratives,</HI> in the Modern Quack Sen&s;e, or by any <HI>Oc|cult Qualities,</HI> or Magical Effect, of Me|dicines on the Blood, where People were not to know what they took, or after what manner they were to expect Relief, but by a skilful Direction and Regimen in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Things, which have, I know not for what Rea&s;on, been common|ly called the <HI>Non-Naturals,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Diet, Air, Exerci&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. But I &s;hould rather chu&s;e to call the&s;e the <HI>Univer&s;als</HI> or <HI>Con|&s;titutionals,</HI> becau&s;e the Original Natural Con&s;titutions and Primary Qualities do al|mo&s;t entirely, ab&s;olutely and univer&s;ally de|pend upon them, &s;o far as Moderating and Tempering them can fall under the Con&s;i|deration of a Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> Diet increa&s;es the Cra&s;|&s;ament of the Blood, and accumulates <HI>Fat</HI> more than any thing el&s;e; it oilifies and enriches the Blood, and promotes the Heat and Humidity of the Con&s;titution, which is the Characteri&s;tick of that Temperament which by the Antients was call'd <HI>Sanguine.</HI> But when this Con&s;titution becomes In|temperate
<PB N="37" REF="40">and Morbid, it is the Foundation of all tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es which are owing to an overgrowth of Fat, and a too thick and rich Blood.</P>
<P>A <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> join'd with <HI>Water-Drinking,</HI> encrea&s;es the <HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood more than the <HI>Cra&s;&s;ament.</HI> It cools, refrigerates and moi&s;tens the Habit or Con&s;titution, moderately contracts the Solids, and promotes the Alvine and Uri|nary Di&s;charges. But it has not the &s;ame Effect on the Cutaneous Evacuations by <HI>Sweat</HI> and <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> which it rather le&s;&s;ens and re&s;trains. And yet, by joining this Regimen in Diet to a moderate u&s;e of warm Liquors, or &s;uch as contain a <HI>Vinous Spirit,</HI> any immoderate Check or Re&s;traint of Per&s;piration may ea&s;ily be prevented: As, on the other hand, <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Wa|ter-drinking</HI> are, in a good mea&s;ure, Pre|ventatives of the ill Con&s;equences, which might otherwi&s;e follow, from the too free U&s;e of a <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> Diet.</P>
<P>THE Choice of <HI>Air</HI> is undoubtedly of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to moderate and
<PB N="38" REF="41">reduce a Con&s;titution, when it grows into any Intemperature; and here the Con&s;titu|tion of the Air, with regard to the Prima|ry Qualities above mentioned, compared with the Con&s;titution of the Patient, will afford any Man a &s;ure and unerring Rule in the choice of <HI>Air.</HI> For 'tis certain that any Error of Con&s;titution ought to be rectifyed and reduced by the contrary Tem|per and Quality of the Air, and no body would chu&s;e a <HI>Hot Air</HI> for a too <HI>Hot Con&s;titution,</HI> or a <HI>Cold Air</HI> for a <HI>Cold One,</HI> and &s;o of the Re&s;t.</P>

<P>OF all Exerci&s;es for Health, as well as Plea&s;ure, nothing can &s;tand in Competition with <HI>Riding</HI> and <HI>Swimming;</HI> which won|derfully brace the Nerves and Solids in ge|neral, re&s;tore their Ela&s;tick Tone, open Ob&s;tructions, and promote the &s;everal na|tural Secretions and Evacuations, beyond any other <HI>Gymna&s;tick Regimen</HI> what&s;oever.</P>
<P>MODERATE <HI>Sleep</HI> is the great <HI>Solamen</HI> and Re&s;torative of Nature, by which the Organs are warm'd, moi&s;tned and lubrica|ted, and the &s;everal Springs of Motion wound up, and prepared for farther Action in the waking Hours. But in this Ca&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;ive Indulgence of Sleep, or Overwatch|ing and Want of Sleep, are equally injuri|ous to, and produce different and contrary Effects upon, the Con&s;titution. For <HI>Ex|ce&s;&s;ive Sleeping</HI> checks and re&s;trains all the natural Secretions and Evacuations, weakens and relaxes the whole Animal Frame, de|&s;troys the Tone of the Mu&s;cles, and induces &s;uch a weak, cold, humid and flabby State of the Nerves, as threatens a <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> and frequently terminates in one; which I have more than once known to be the Con&s;e|quence of it.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43">
<P>ON the other hand, <HI>Overwatching</HI> and the Want of natural Sleep, wears and wa&s;tes the whole Animal Con&s;titution, heats the Blood, drys and contracts the Nerves, and, in fine, either kills with a <HI>Fever</HI> attended with a <HI>Phren&s;y,</HI> or induces a <HI>Mania, Lu|nacy,</HI> or Di&s;traction of &s;ome &s;ort or other, as is but too commonly &s;een and experi|enced.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> have &s;o great a &s;hare in the Con&s;titutions and Di&s;ea&s;es of the Body, that, in my Opinion, this ought to be rec|koned one of the principal Provinces of Phy&s;ick; and indeed, with a Saving to the Divines, I think Phy&s;icians are the fitte&s;t Per&s;ons to apply a proper Relief, under tho&s;e great <HI>Emotions</HI> and <HI>Perturbations of Mind;</HI> which either ari&s;e from the Body at fir&s;t, or are &s;oon <HI>materializ'd</HI> by a commu|nication with it.

<PB N="41" REF="44">
<P>'TIS evident that the plea&s;urable and painful Pa&s;&s;ions, have very different and even quite contrary Effects upon the Blood, Hu|mours, and re&s;pective Organs of the Body, of which a Mechanical Account and Expla|nation, may be &s;een in the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Morgan's Philo&s;ophical Principles of Me|dicine;</HI> a Book that can never be too much &s;tudyed by the young Phy&s;ician, who in|tends to make a Figure in his Profe&s;&s;ion, and would build his Practice on plain Facts and indi&s;putable Principles. To that Trea|ti&s;e, therefore, I &s;hall refer the curious Reader; where, I can a&s;&s;ure him, he will find this Subject: touch'd with uncommon Delicacy, and &s;ee the Origin, and different Modifications, of the Pa&s;&s;ions beautifully de&s;cribed, and their Effects on the Animal Organi&s;m, in a &s;trong and ma&s;terly manner, Anatomically delineated and Mechanically accounted for: Which makes it the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for me to enter farther into the Theory of the Matter here.</P>
<P>'TIS evident in Fact that <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> warm the Blood, diffu&s;e the natural Heat, rai&s;e the Pul&s;e, and take off any Irritation

<P><HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> affect the Blood and Hu|mours much after the &s;ame manner with <HI>Vinous Spirits, Opiates,</HI> and other &s;uch Exhilerating <HI>Volatiles;</HI> but <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> when they are &s;trong and overbearing, with <HI>Acids</HI> and <HI>Salts</HI> upon the Stomach; <HI>i. e.</HI> they affect the Organs with Pain, lower the Pul&s;e, repel the natural Heat, and di&s;|arm a Man of Spirit, Strength and Re&s;olu|tion, or, perhaps, keep him con&s;tantly a|wake and attentive to the painful di&s;agree|able Scene, till he has quite lo&s;t his Sen&s;es. From this &s;hort Account of the Mechanical and mo&s;t obvious Effects of the Pa&s;&s;ions, the Methods of relieving them when they

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Of the</HI> Materia Medica <HI>in general.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the va&s;tne&s;s of this Subject, I have no de&s;ign to write a Volume upon it, nor do I think it nece&s;&s;ary. But con&s;idering the Bulk to which the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> is grown, 'tis certain|ly, I think, high time to come to &s;ome pro|per Limitations and Re&s;trictions concerning it, before it is quite run out into <HI>Infinity.</HI> For, to &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive Degree is this Mat|ter grown already, that a Man had almo&s;t as good read over all the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parlia|ment</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="47">and Laws of <HI>England,</HI> as the Books of Phy&s;ick, and the infinite Jumble and Confu&s;ion of Remedys of one &s;ort or an|other. I am &s;en&s;ible, indeed, that the be&s;t and able&s;t Phy&s;icians among us, have very much reduced the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and brought it into a narrow Compa&s;s with re&s;pect to their own Practice; but this is no advantage to tho&s;e who have not bought their Experience at &s;o dear a rate, or who have not had opportunitys of making tryals them&s;elves, but mu&s;t &s;till go on, in their Prac|tice, upon the Judgments of &s;uch as have pretended to va&s;t Experience before them, and who have, hereupon, cryed up a prodi|gious number of <HI>Simple</HI> and <HI>Compound Re|medies</HI> as infallible, and fill'd large Volumes with them, when, perhaps, few or none of them, upon tryal, will be found to an&s;wer their Character. So that, amid&s;t this huge Lumber, a young Practitioner mu&s;t &s;till be continually &s;ifting out a Medicine, for his purpo&s;e, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, like a <HI>Pearl</HI> in the common <HI>Rubbi&s;h,</HI> or a Needle in a Heap of Sand.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="48">
<P>THIS Uncertainty and Confu&s;ion in Phy|&s;ick, have not ari&s;en from any of the obvi|ous <HI>Sen&s;ible Properties</HI> or <HI>Effects</HI> of Me|dicines, as they affect the <HI>Natural Evacua|tions</HI> or the Primary <HI>Con&s;titutional Quali|ties;</HI> for here the Practice &s;tands upon a pretty good certainty: but only from the vain and fruitle&s;s &s;earch after <HI>Specificks,</HI> in the modern ab&s;urd Sen&s;e, or rather <HI>Non|&s;en&s;e,</HI> of the Word. This, as the Matter appears to me, has been the true Cau&s;e of all &s;uch Darkne&s;s and Ob&s;curity, as we find the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> under to this ve|ry Day. I &s;hall therefore, under this Sec|tion, lay down &s;ome Principles, well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Fact, which may &s;erve as &s;o ma|ny certain Rules of Judgment, whereby the young Phy&s;ician may govern him&s;elf in the choice Medicines, &s;o as to render his Practice le&s;s precarious and uncertain, than it otherwi&s;e might be, upon his fir&s;t &s;etting out in the World. And herein, I &s;hall proceed in this plain and natural Me|thod, by con&s;idering how far the &s;everal Parts of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> as it now &s;tands, are <HI>Dige&s;tible</HI> or <HI>Indige&s;tible;</HI> in what <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> and under what <HI>Circum&s;tances,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="49">they are capable of pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Lacteals</HI> and mixing with the Blood; and what <HI>Ef|fects</HI> may be expected from them, when they get there, which will take in all I intend to &s;ay on this Subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN it is certain, that nothing can pa&s;s the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> but what has been pre|viou&s;ly liquified, and reduced to an <HI>Efflu|vium,</HI> or an exceeding fine, thin and rarefy|ed <HI>Vapour.</HI> Not only the Fibrous <HI>Solid</HI> Parts of our common Food, but likewi&s;e the more fix'd <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Salts,</HI> with which it abounds, are incapable of being di&s;&s;olved, liquifyed and volatiliz'd, by the <HI>Dige&s;tive Heat</HI> and Action of the Stomach, and the <HI>Attractive Power</HI> of the Lacteals; and therefore the Re&s;idue of the Aliment, which cannot be re&s;olved, attenuated and fluxili|zed, by &s;uch a degree of Heat and Motion during the time of Concoction, are by Na|ture precipitated, thru&s;t forward and eject|ed out of the Body, thro' the common Al|vine Excretory Ducts and Pa&s;&s;ages. Now, if &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of our common Aliment, which has no &s;tronger or clo&s;er Texture than that of the <HI>Vegetable</HI> and
<PB N="47" REF="50"><HI>Animal Solids,</HI> cannot be &s;o far di&s;&s;olved and attenuated in the Stomach, as to be &s;train'd off thro' the Lacteals; what &s;hall we &s;ay to tho&s;e va&s;tly more &s;olid and compact Sub&s;tances which are often given as <HI>Speci|fick Alteratives?</HI> or by what <HI>Chemi&s;try,</HI> or <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> can our Specificians pretend to convey &s;uch Sub&s;tances as the&s;e into the Blood, without fir&s;t rendering them, by &s;ome previous Operation, <HI>Soluble</HI> and <HI>Flux|ilizable</HI> in Water?</P>
<P><HI>Sulphur, Aethiops, Cinnabar, Antimony, Mineral Bezoar,</HI> and univer&s;ally all <HI>Mi|neral Glebes</HI> and <HI>Metalline Calces,</HI> com|municate nothing to Boiling Water, but their Parts remain fix'd, in&s;eparable and unalterable, again&s;t all the Power of &s;uch a degree of Heat and Motion; which is yet va&s;tly greater than can be produced, by the natural dige&s;tive Heat and Action of the Stomach, during the time of Concoction. Nay, if the Parts of any &s;uch &s;olid cohering Sub&s;tances be fir&s;t of all broken and di|vided, as far as po&s;&s;ible, by any Grinding or Trituration whatever, yet &s;till, when they are afterwards committed to boiling
<PB N="48" REF="51">Water, &s;uch a degree of Heat and Motion makes no Alteration, and cannot break or divide them farther: but, after all, their &s;malle&s;t Parts, when examined by a Micro|&s;cope, will appear to be many thou&s;and times larger than any of the Orifices of the Lacteals, of which any Per&s;on may ea|&s;ily be convinc'd upon tryal. And con&s;e|quently, he who expects to pa&s;s &s;uch Parti|cles thro' the Lacteals into the Blood, even after their utmo&s;t Trituration, and con&s;e|quent Maceration, in any Liquor which the Stomach can bear, will find him&s;elf deceived, and may as well attempt to thread a Needle with a Cable, or, to &s;peak accord|ing to our Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation, <HI>It is as im|po&s;&s;ible as for a Camel to go thro' the Eye of a Needle.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. SUCH <HI>Metalline Sub&s;tances,</HI> as above mentioned, may indeed be converted into the form of a <HI>Salt,</HI> by the Power of &s;trong <HI>Acids,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Oil of Vitriol, Spirit of Nitre,</HI> &amp;c. as is well known to the Che|mi&s;ts; and in this Ca&s;e they become Soluble in Water, and may be volatiliz'd in it, to any a&s;&s;ignable degree of Tenuity. But then
<PB N="49" REF="52">they are converted into <HI>Poy&s;ons,</HI> and can|not be thought fit <HI>Alteratives,</HI> unle&s;s the intended Alteration be Death.</P>
<P>I know that &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Metalline A|cid Salts,</HI> may be given in &s;ome Ca&s;es, as <HI>Emeticks</HI> and <HI>Catharticks:</HI> bu tthen, as they are not intended to pa&s;s into the Blood, but to be pre&s;ently thrown out of the Bo|dy together with &s;uch other morbid Matter as they derive from the remote Parts; &s;o, in no ca&s;e whatever, &s;hould they be exhibited as <HI>Alteratives</HI> in a long continued Cour&s;e of Medicine, nor indeed us'd for any other purpo&s;e, but with the greate&s;t Caution, and upon the utmo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity. They are edged Tools, and never to be meddled with without &s;ome Danger.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, that &s;ome Phy&s;icians have recommended even the alterative Power of Poy&s;ons, when the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages are guarded again&s;t them, and they are &s;afe|ly conveyed into the Blood and remote Rece&s;&s;es of the Body; but, upon what Prin|ciples this Practice is founded, I own, is be|yond my Comprehen&s;ion. Would any but
<PB N="50" REF="53">a Madman, tru&s;t an Enemy in his Hou&s;e, or Clo&s;et, that he knows would murder him in the open Street? or is it conceiva|ble that, the much thinner, finer and ten|derer Coats and Membranes of the remote Glands and &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, under &s;uch Reclu&s;es, &s;hould be able to bear the Power of &s;o va&s;t a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> better than the Sto|mach it &s;elf where there is &s;o free and o|pen a Di&s;charge?</P>
<P>It is well known that <HI>Poy&s;oning</HI> has been made an Art of, and reckoned a prin|cipal Part of Magick; and it has been re|ported of the <HI>Indians</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Italians,</HI> that they can give Poy&s;ons to operate in a certain a&s;&s;ignable time, either longer or &s;horter, without producing any pre&s;ent ill Con&s;equences when fir&s;t exhibited. This method of Poy&s;oning indeed, might, per|haps, receive va&s;t Improvement from &s;uch a Notion of Alteratives; but, as this does not belong to <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> I &s;hall leave the con&s;ideration of it to others. And, &s;ince no Method has yet been di&s;covered, of go|verning and directing the Venenous Parti|cles, when got into the Habit, to the mor|bid
<PB N="51" REF="54">Matter only, or of preventing their baneful Impre&s;&s;ion, and deleterious Effects, on every part of the Animal Frame and Con&s;titution; I &s;hall not only ab&s;olutely reject the internal U&s;e of any &s;uch &s;ort of Medicines, but draw one practical Conclu|&s;ion from the whole which I take to be of great Importance; <HI>&s;c.</HI> That any Medicine, endued with a &s;trong Emetick or Cathartick <HI>Stimulus,</HI> &s;hould never be &s;uffered to lie long in the Body, or to pa&s;s the Lacteals where it is capable of it, but ought to be thrown off, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, by the near|e&s;t Outlets and propere&s;t Excretorys; toge|ther with &s;uch other Matter as it has de|rived and prepared for Evacuation.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides tho&s;e things that are ab&s;o|lutely Indi&s;&s;oluble, and cannot be convey|ed into the Blood at all, and &s;uch as, by rea&s;on of their violent <HI>Stimulus</HI> and Cor|ro&s;ive Qualities, ought not to be tru&s;ted there, there is another &s;ort of Medicines which might ju&s;tly be expell'd the Province of Phy&s;ick, under this notion of <HI>Specifick Alteratives,</HI> tho' they are not ab&s;olutely Indige&s;tible, nor endued with any hurtful
<PB N="52" REF="55"><HI>Stimulus:</HI> What I here aim at, is the <HI>Te&s;ta|cea, Re&s;ins, Boles,</HI> and <HI>Earths,</HI> which will not impart a Tincture &s;o as to be liquifyed and volatiliz'd with Water, or any other common potable Liquor.</P>
<P>ANY of the&s;e, when retain'd in the Body, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily clog and ob&s;truct the primary concoctive Organs, and do more Mi&s;chief, in a little time, than all the Advantages that can be expected from them. For, as they cannot be &s;ufficiently re&s;olv'd, liquifyed and &s;ublimated, by the natural di|ge&s;tive Heat of the Stomach, &s;o as to pa&s;s the Lacteals, they mu&s;t needs foul and ob|&s;truct the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, impair the Appetite, &s;uppre&s;s the natural Heat, weaken the Force of the Mu&s;cles and Ela&s;tick Fibres in ge|neral, and, by continuance, induce an <HI>Atro|phy</HI> of the wor&s;t &s;ort, which ari&s;es from an Ob&s;truction of the Lacteals, and a con&s;e|quent depravation of Dige&s;tion and lo&s;s of Appetite.</P>
<P>BUT while I am exploding, and &s;etting a&s;ide the&s;e things as <HI>Alteratives,</HI> or with regard to any good Effects they can have
<PB N="53" REF="56">upon the remote Glands and Membranous Ve&s;icles, I would not be thought to main|tain, or &s;uppo&s;e, that they may not, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, be of u&s;e, in particular Ca&s;es, by their pre&s;ent Effects on the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages; provided they are extruded and thrown out of the Body, by Emeticks or Catharticks, as &s;oon as they have an&s;wered their proper Intention. But this will be farther explain|ed in &s;ome of the following Sections.</P>
<P>ANOTHER principal thing, to be regard|ed in the Practice of Phy&s;ick, is the <HI>Do&s;es</HI> of Medicines, and the Manner of Exhibit|ing them. For 'tis certain, that where a Medicine is never &s;o good and efficacious, and capable of an&s;wering the Intention of the Phy&s;ician of it &s;elf; yet &s;till this Effect may be eluded, and Nature deprived of the expected and intended Relief, by a wrong method of Exhibition, or by an Error com|mitted, either in the <HI>Quantitys</HI> or <HI>Forms</HI> of &s;uch Simple or Simples, on which the whole Intention of Cure depends.</P>
<P>AND nothing, in my Opinion, has prov'd more prejudicial in the Practice of Phy&s;ick,
<PB N="54" REF="57">than the Stated <HI>Canonical Do&s;es</HI> of Me|dicines, whether Simple or Compound. When once a Man imagines him&s;elf to be pinn'd down, in the giving of Medicines, to any &s;tated Authoriz'd Do&s;es, he mu&s;t not go beyond it, tho' he &s;hould mi&s;s of his Intention and lo&s;e his Patient. And from hence one may venture to &s;ay, that more hurt has been done by trifling with Effica|cious Medicines, and thereby lo&s;ing Time, than by mi&s;taking the Ca&s;e, and directing things contrary to the Intention of Cure.</P>
<P>BUT this Error is oftne&s;t committed in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Compounds,</HI> which are com|monly look'd upon and regarded as &s;o ma|ny <HI>Canons</HI> in Phy&s;ick; and con&s;equently entitled to an ab&s;olute and implicit Obedi|ence and Conformity. But, as this is cer|tainly the prudential Orthodox Method of Trifling, and of doing a great deal of Mi&s;|chief by doing no Good, &s;o I dare be bold to &s;ay, that he who &s;hall govern him&s;elf by the&s;e Rules, without u&s;ing his own Judgment in varying the <HI>Do&s;es</HI> and <HI>Forms,</HI> as occa&s;ion requires, will not only often|times lo&s;e his Patient, but his Reputation into the Bargain.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="58">
<P>It is certain that the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Compo&s;i|tion</HI> in Medicine, upon which all our com|mon Di&s;pen&s;atorys are founded, aro&s;e with the <HI>Specifick</HI> or <HI>Corpu&s;cularian Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and with that it mu&s;t &s;ink again; for, while the Practice &s;tood upon this Chimaerical Foundation, the Phy&s;ician, for want of be|ing acquainted with the Obvious Sen&s;ible Qualities and Effects of Medicines, and the Method that una&s;&s;i&s;ted Nature took to re|lieve her &s;elf, under any particular Di&s;or|der, could have no other Intention in his Medical Proce&s;&s;es, than to cure by <HI>Magick</HI> or <HI>Occult Qualities;</HI> and con&s;equently mu&s;t conclude that his chance of Succe&s;s, always ro&s;e in proportion to the number of Ingre|dients in the <HI>Compound Remedy.</HI> But an Extemporaneous Practice is, certainly, the only true and rational Method of practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick; as this may, by the Phy&s;ician who knows what he is about, be always accom|modated to the great Variety and Compli|cation of Symptoms in particular Ca&s;es: and nothing &s;urely can be more Ab&s;urd and Irrational, than <HI>Extemporaneous General Pre&s;criptions,</HI> or <HI>Stated Canonical Com|pound Remedys.</HI></P>
<PB N="56" REF="59">
<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders the mo&s;t com|mon prevailing <HI>Compounds;</HI> will find them to be a general confu&s;ed Jumble of Sim|ples of very different Virtues and Proper|ties; and, con&s;equently, not containing, up|on the whole, the real Power or Efficacy of any one Ingredient in the whole Compo&s;i|tion. And if any &s;uch General Artificial Compo&s;ition &s;hould happen to an&s;wer the Intention, in &s;ome particular Ca&s;es, it is more by chance than any thing el&s;e. And, in the&s;e <HI>Canonical Compounds,</HI> it may be pretty generally ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Simple</HI> that gives it the Name, or from which the Denomination is taken, has the lea&s;t &s;hare in the Compo&s;ition, and might do much better alone, or with any ea&s;y extempora|neous Management.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this Art of Compo&s;ition, or confounding all Virtues and Properties together, there is another artificial Method of &s;poiling, or rendering U&s;ele&s;s and In|&s;ignificant, the be&s;t and mo&s;t Efficacious Simples, by pretending to pre&s;erve and &s;e|cure their original native Effects and Vir|tues,

<P><HI>Simple</HI> and <HI>Compound Waters</HI> drawn from Vegetables, are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;im|ply ineffectual as to any Intention for which they are given; and he, who makes u&s;e of them for any other purpo&s;e than as Vehicles, for Medicines of greater Efficacy, will always find him&s;elf di&s;appointed; and, even for this purpo&s;e, the <HI>Simple</HI> or low <HI>Di&s;tilled Waters,</HI> not having Strength e|nough generally to keep from Mothering and Spoiling upon hand, are not half &s;o good as <HI>Common Water</HI> or fre&s;h <HI>Small Beer.</HI> But the <HI>Compound Waters,</HI> which are rai&s;ed to a proof Spirit, may, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, do very well and be thought plea&s;ant enough as a <HI>Dram,</HI> tho', I think, mo&s;t of 'em are fitter to be &s;old at <HI>Inns</HI> and <HI>Coffee-hou&s;es</HI> than the Apothecarys Shops.</P>

And, &s;ince all the proper Medi|cinal Virtues and Powers of the Simples them&s;elves con&s;i&s;ts and re&s;ides in the&s;e <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils,</HI> by &s;uch a Preparation and Ma|nagement, they may certainly be given to va&s;tly greater Advantage than in their com|mon <HI>Gro&s;s Sub&s;tances.</HI> For by this all the
<PB N="59" REF="62">Efficacy of the Simples may be obtain'd fre&s;h and pure, and to any given degree as the Ca&s;e requires, &s;o as to come up fully to the Intention. And hereby al&s;o the Stomach may be &s;aved the Difficulty and Inconvenience of Solution, Dige&s;tion and Separation of the Parts; which is done be|fore-hand in this way of Preparation, to the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Nature. For it can|not certainly be a rational Method, or good Contrivance, to commit <HI>Gro&s;s, Solid</HI> and <HI>Strongly-Cohering Sub&s;tances,</HI> to a &s;ick, weak and di&s;temper'd Stomach, which can|not perhaps retain and dige&s;t any ordinary &s;olid Food.</P>
<P>AND, from the &s;ame <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chemi&s;try</HI> of Nature, it mu&s;t likewi&s;e fol|low, that all nau&s;eous, &s;ickening and loath|&s;ome Medicines, ought as much as po&s;&s;ible to be avoided; that is, they ought ab&s;olute|ly to be avoided and never given or urg'd at all. For 'tis a hard Ca&s;e, indeed, when a weak languid Patient mu&s;t be forced, with Things which he could never have taken, in his be&s;t Health, without loathing Reluctancy and &s;en&s;ible Di&s;order.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="63">
<P>THE Notion of <HI>Specificks,</HI> and the vain pretence of curing Di&s;ea&s;es by the <HI>Occult</HI> Operation of Medicines upon the Blood, has been the true ground of all &s;uch Vio|lence offered to Nature. For, if the Di&s;|ea&s;e is to be cured by Things which are to affect the Blood, after a &s;ecret and inexpli|cable Manner, the Patient mu&s;t believe and &s;uffer for the &s;ake of Health, again&s;t all &s;en&s;ible Appearances to the contrary: for, no doubt, the <HI>Specifick</HI> Remedys will do their Work, and faithfully execute their Commi&s;&s;ion, when they get into the Blood and arrive at the Seat of the Di&s;order, what|ever Mi&s;chief or Injury they may occa&s;ion, to the Con&s;titution, before they get there.</P>
<P>I have made the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, which appear to me plainly nece&s;&s;ary, with regard to the general U&s;e and Application of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> for the &s;ake of &s;uch Gen|tlemen, only, as &s;hall think it worth their while to form their Conduct upon the Rea&s;on and Nature of Things, and build their Practice on Facts and Experiments.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Of Stimulating and Quieting Medicines.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine of <HI>Stimulation</HI> and <HI>Pa|cification,</HI> or the Effects of Pain and Plea&s;ure, is of &s;o va&s;t an extent in Phy&s;ick, and &s;o e&s;&s;entail to all <HI>Animal Mechani&s;m;</HI> that I thought it a matter of the utmo&s;t Im|portance, to con&s;ider this part of the <HI>Ma|teria Medica,</HI> in a di&s;tinct Section by it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Pain,</HI> or Unea&s;ine&s;s, is the univer&s;al <HI>Sti|mulus,</HI> or Principle of Motion in all <HI>Ani|mal Mechani&s;m.</HI> When it ari&s;es from the <HI>Body</HI> it has a material Cau&s;e, and tho' when it ari&s;es from the <HI>Mind,</HI> and has no other Cau&s;e, but the various Modifications of Good and Evil as they appear to the Judgment or Under&s;tanding; yet &s;till it
<PB N="62" REF="65">may be ob&s;erv'd, that this mere Mental Pain, when impre&s;s'd on the <HI>Animal Or|gani&s;m,</HI> will have ju&s;t the &s;ame Effect on it, as if it had originally ari&s;en from &s;ome material <HI>Stimulus.</HI> And, in this Ca&s;e, alter|ing the Judgment and thereby exciting Plea|&s;ure, affects the <HI>Animal Con&s;titution,</HI> much after the &s;ame manner, as a <HI>Vinous Spirit, Volatile Salt, Opium,</HI> or any other mate|rial Pacifyer. And this Con&s;ideration is of &s;uch con&s;equence, that, without it, there can be no &s;uch Thing as either the Know|ledge, or Application of <HI>Animal Mechani&s;m</HI> to the purpo&s;e of my pre&s;ent Subject. But having ob&s;erv'd this once for all, I &s;hall confine my &s;elf, in what remains, to the Con&s;ideration of <HI>Material Stimulation</HI> and <HI>Pacification;</HI> where the Pain, or Plea&s;ure, Stimulation, or Pacification, ari&s;e from with|out and may be a&s;cribed to &s;ome material Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis well know that the active Prin|ciples of Bodies are their <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils;</HI> and that the&s;e variou&s;ly affect the Animal Solids and Fluids, as they are <HI>Pungent</HI> and <HI>Vellicating,</HI> or <HI>Softening</HI> and <HI>Lubricating,
<PB N="63" REF="66">Fix'd</HI> or <HI>Volatile, Heating</HI> and <HI>Rarefying,</HI> or <HI>Cooling</HI> and <HI>Conden&s;ing.</HI> Nor are there any Operations of &s;timulating and quieting Medicines, but what may be under&s;tood and explained, by the&s;e their obvious &s;en|&s;ible Properties or Mechanical Effects.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erv'd farther, that an Or|gan may be &s;timulated, vellicated, or put to pain, either by an immoderate <HI>Di&s;ten|tion</HI> or <HI>Compre&s;&s;ion:</HI> For, in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, the original Structure and Confor|mation of the Organ or Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t be al|tered and broken, the natural Indication or Notification of which, in the Animal Con&s;titution, is <HI>Pain.</HI> A <HI>Stimulus,</HI> there|fore, may be either <HI>Hot</HI> or <HI>Cold; i. e.</HI> the &s;timulating Sub&s;tance may either be a &s;trong, rigid, conden&s;ative <HI>Salt,</HI> or a heat|ing, rarifying or pungent <HI>Oil.</HI></P>
<P>IN a cold conden&s;ative <HI>Stimulus,</HI> the Afflux and Weight of the Fluids, towards the Organs or Ve&s;&s;els &s;timulated, and the Evacuations depending thereon, will be in|crea&s;ed. And when any &s;uch <HI>Stimulus</HI> is too &s;trong and powerful, the Afflux of the
<PB N="64" REF="67">Fluids to the &s;timulated Parts, will overbear the contractile Re&s;titutive Force of the So|lids, in which Ca&s;e the Parts mu&s;t Swell, Mortify and Gangrene, or the <HI>Stimulus</HI> will act as a <HI>Poy&s;on,</HI> and the Per&s;on thus affected dies, under all the Pain and Torture of &s;uch an Ero&s;ion, in the full force and vigour of his Sen&s;es, without any <HI>Stupor</HI> or Lethar|gick Symptoms.</P>
<P>BUT in a hot rarefactive <HI>Stimulus,</HI> the Symptoms will be very different, which I &s;hall here briefly con&s;ider and explain. For, tho' the &s;welling of the &s;timulated Part will always be, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> in propor|tion to the quantity of the Fluid flowing to the Part, yet in this Ca&s;e of a hot rarefactive <HI>Stimulus,</HI> the Organ or Ve&s;&s;el will be con&s;iderably more inflated and di&s;tended, by the Action of the heated rarefied Air included in the Fluid, and the circumjacent Ve&s;&s;els nece&s;&s;arily Compre&s;s'd and Con|&s;tringed to a greater degree, and con&s;equent|ly the influx of their Fluids will be inter|rupted or le&s;&s;en'd in proportion. Now the Effects of this Inflation or Di&s;tention, will be mo&s;t remarkable and &s;en&s;ible, when it
<PB N="65" REF="68">happens in the Stomach, which is the prin|cipal and original Seat of the Action of Medicines. And here the heating rarefy|ing <HI>Oil,</HI> acting upon this Organ, and in|flating or di&s;tending it more or le&s;s, may in its Effects prove either <HI>Sedative, Pacifying</HI> and <HI>Compo&s;ing; Sickening, Surfeiting</HI> and <HI>Stimulating;</HI> or <HI>Stupifying, Lethargick</HI> and <HI>Mortal;</HI> according to the different degree of &s;uch Inflation, and the different power of the Cau&s;e or Counterforce which it acts again&s;t.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e then the Pul&s;e lower'd, the natural Heat repelled, the Per&s;piration check'd, the Tyde of the vital Fluid &s;unk and depre&s;s'd, and con&s;equently the Mem|branes of the Stomach, Inte&s;tines and <HI>Vi&s;|cera,</HI> tumifyed and relaxed from a Redun|dancy and Surcharge of Fluids, occa&s;ioned and brought on by Fa&s;ting. Watching, hard Labor, immoderate Purging and Vomit|ing, and the like Cau&s;e. And 'tis well know that, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, a moderate quan|tity of Wine, or any generous heating and rarifying Liquor abounding with a <HI>Vinous Spirit</HI> or <HI>Volatile Oil,</HI> will give a very great
<PB N="64" REF="69"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="65" REF="70"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="66" REF="71">and &s;udden Relief, by diffu&s;ing the natural Heat, rai&s;ing the Pul&s;e, and re&s;toring the Per&s;piration. If this warm <HI>Effluvium,</HI> and con&s;equent Inflation of the Stomach, be carryed &s;omewhat farther, all the foregoing Effects of it will be increa&s;ed; the Pul&s;e will ri&s;e higher, the external Heat will be greater, and the augmented Per&s;piration will break out into Sweats; which Sweats in &s;uch a Ca&s;e are va&s;tly beneficial, as they deterge and purge the cutaneous Glands and excretory Ducts, which were before ob|&s;tructed by the Induration and Concretion of their contained Matter.</P>
<P>BUT, if this Di&s;tention of the Stomach &s;hall be &s;till increa&s;ed, &s;o as more &s;trongly to compre&s;s the de&s;cending <HI>Aorta</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> contained in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and to throw a greater quantity of Blood upwards thro' the more patent Canals; this Increa&s;e, by compre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Nerves</HI> in their Origin, will fix them, and induce Sleep, which will be more or le&s;s &s;ound, and of longer or &s;horter continuance, according to the different Power and Efficacy of the Cau&s;e. But when this Cau&s;e is rai&s;ed to its highe&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="72">Degree, and acts with an overbearing Strength and Violence, it produces a <HI>Le|thargy, Apoplexy</HI> and mortal <HI>Stupor,</HI> un|der which, the Per&s;on thus affected dies Sen&s;ele&s;s and Convul&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the lower Parts which derive their Blood from the de&s;cending Trunk of the <HI>Aorta;</HI> while the &s;uperior Mu&s;cles, which are overcharg|ed with Blood, remain fix'd and in a man|ner motionle&s;s. But the direct contrary to all this happens, when a Per&s;on dies under the Power of any &s;timulating, <HI>acid</HI> or <HI>&s;aline Poy&s;on.</HI> And from hence it may appear, that <HI>Alkaline</HI> and <HI>Acid</HI> Poy&s;ons are a &s;ort of Antidotes, or Counter-Poy&s;ons to each other: for as <HI>Vinous Spirits</HI> and <HI>Volatile Oils</HI> and <HI>Salts,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Opium,</HI> mitigate the Violence of corro&s;ive <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Acids,</HI> &s;o do the&s;e re&s;train and moderate the other. And from hence it is evident, that Life or Death, Killing or Curing depend on the different U&s;e of the &s;ame things; and what is a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Antidote</HI> in one Ca&s;e or me|thod of Exhibition, will under different Circum&s;tances act as a deadly <HI>Poy&s;on.</HI></P>
<PB N="68" REF="73">
<P><HI>Emeticks</HI> and <HI>Catharticks</HI> differ only in the degree of their Vellication or <HI>Sti|mulus.</HI> If their &s;timulating Power be &s;uch, as to act immediately on the Stomach, be|fore they can pa&s;s farther, they prove E|metick and are thrown off by Vomiting. But, where the rigid &s;timulating <HI>Salts</HI> or <HI>Acids,</HI> are intimately united with a &s;oft lubricating <HI>Oil,</HI> in the e&s;&s;ential Texture and Con&s;titution of the Medicine it &s;elf, this qualifying <HI>Oil</HI> is not pre&s;ently &s;epara|ted from the more ponderous fix'd <HI>Oil</HI> and pungent <HI>Salts;</HI> and con&s;equently, the Stimulation of the Medicine may not be &s;en&s;ible in the Stomach, nor its Action perceiv'd till it comes into the Inte&s;tines where it operates as a Purge.</P>
<P>As <HI>Emeticks</HI> and <HI>Catharticks</HI> differ from each other, in the degree of their <HI>Stimulus,</HI> &s;o they differ very con&s;iderably, among them&s;elves, according to their dif|ferent Strength or &s;timulating Power; or as their &s;timulating <HI>Salts</HI> and ponderous <HI>Oils,</HI> are more or le&s;s tempered and quali|fyed with a &s;oft Lymph and lubricating <HI>Nutritious Oil.</HI> But, of all Catharticks, the
<PB N="69" REF="74">&s;trong purgative <HI>Re&s;ins</HI> artificially drawn upon Spirit of Wine, are the mo&s;t detri|mental and attended with the wor&s;t Con|&s;equences; as the repeated U&s;e of them mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly impairs the Appetite, ob&s;tructs the Lacteals, and fouls, clogs and weakens, the concoctive Organs and <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> in ge|neral. And this, I think, one may lay down as a certain Rule, that where Nature has prepared a Medicine, it can never be much mended by Art.</P>
<P><HI>Jalap</HI> in its natural &s;tate, is, perhaps, one of the be&s;t general <HI>Purgatives</HI> in the World. For tho' it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;ufficient &s;timulating Power, to an&s;wer the end of a Purge, even where &s;trong and quick Purging is requi&s;ite; yet it abounds, at the &s;ame time, with <HI>Phlegm</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> enough to correct and moderate its Operation, &s;o as to render it &s;afe as well as effectual: which good Pro|perties the artificial <HI>Re&s;in</HI> is deprived of; nor can any Art afterwards re&s;tore them again. If this <HI>Cathartick</HI> can be at all im|prov'd, it is by mixing and grinding the powdered Root with about a third part of <HI>Calomel,</HI> which makes it more attenuating,
<PB N="70" REF="75">di&s;&s;olvent and deter&s;ive, and, at the &s;ame time, le&s;&s;ens its <HI>Stimulus</HI> and the adhe&s;ive Quality of its <HI>Re&s;in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gutta Gamba</HI> makes a quick, &s;afe and excellent Purge in Drop&s;ies, or where-ever &s;trong Purging is required, when corrected with <HI>Mercury:</HI> and tho', in its natural State, it be too violent and &s;timulating in its O|peration, to be given to any but grown Per&s;ons and tho&s;e of &s;trong and robu&s;t Con&s;titutions; yet, under this management, I can affirm, from a con&s;tant cour&s;e of Ex|perience for many Years, that it may be exhibited, with great &s;afety, to the tendere&s;t Habits and mo&s;t delicate Con&s;titutions. And this indeed, in general, is the only method of correcting every thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a powerful <HI>Stimulus,</HI> or at lea&s;t, as far as I have yet found.</P>
<P><HI>Rhubarb</HI> is a very moderate Purgative, but a great <HI>A&s;tringent</HI> and &s;trengthner of the Stomach and Bowels, when they are too lax and flaccid, and when given with about a third part of <HI>Engli&s;h Saffron,</HI> is an excellent and noble Diuretick, in all great
<PB N="71" REF="76">Relaxations of the Renal Glands and Uri|nary Pa&s;&s;ages. But when 'tis made up into Pills with <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> fir&s;t minutely divi|ded and incorporated with any proper Sub|ject of the <HI>Turpentine</HI> kind, its purgative Quality is greatly &s;trengthned and improv|ed. For, where the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages are foul, and &s;tuffed with a load of Matter which wants to be evacuated, <HI>Rhubarb</HI> thus given, will work as much as <HI>Jalap</HI> given alone, or in its natural State; and this without any Pain or Sickne&s;s, or unea&s;y <HI>Stimulus</HI> what|&s;oever. And this, as I &s;aid before, is the true Art of correcting, not only <HI>Emeticks</HI> and <HI>Catharticks,</HI> but all other Medicines which would, otherwi&s;e, act by a too pow|erful and overbearing <HI>Stimulus</HI> on the Sto|mach and Inte&s;tines. For hereby the atte|nuating, di&s;&s;olving and deob&s;truent Powers of the Medicine are increa&s;ed and &s;trength|ned, and, at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Stimulus</HI> and Vellication on the great Organs le&s;&s;en|ed in the &s;ame proportion. And, indeed, a Phy&s;ician ought never to &s;uffer a Medicine to act by any powerful or too violent a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> &s;o as to occa&s;ion exce&s;&s;ive Pain; becau&s;e, in this Ca&s;e, it comes near to a
<PB N="72" REF="77"><HI>Poy&s;on,</HI> and threatens a Mortification or Gangrene of the Part thus &s;timulated. And whenever this happens, accidentally and be&s;ide the Intention, the only effectual way to prevent farther Mi&s;chief, and to quiet and pacify the Tumult rai&s;ed in the Con|&s;titution, is immediately to give a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;ome powerful <HI>Volatile,</HI> e&s;pe|cially <HI>Opium,</HI> to take off the Pain and, thereby, to prevent the fatal Effects of &s;uch a Stimulation.</P>
<P><HI>Sudorificks</HI> act counter to <HI>Emeticks</HI> and <HI>Catharticks,</HI> and the Operations of the&s;e are, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> reciprocally proportional. Almo&s;t every body mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that a <HI>Sweat</HI> rai&s;ed &s;tops a <HI>Diarrhoea;</HI> and that the checking of Sweat and Per&s;piration, occa&s;ions a <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> if the Inte&s;tines are not ob&s;tructed too at the &s;ame time. The Rea&s;on and Mechani&s;m of this is very evi|dent; for, as all Mu&s;cular, Mechanical or Nece&s;&s;ary, Motion is propagated from the Heart <HI>Undiquaque</HI> in the Direction of the Arterial Blood, 'tis plain that when the Flu|ids move in a &s;urplus Quantity from the Heart inwards towards the Stomach and In|te&s;tines,
<PB N="73" REF="78">and their Evacuation that way is increa&s;ed by any Cau&s;e what&s;oever, the Di&s;charges, in the contrary direction, to|wards the external Surface or cutaneous E|munctories, mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed in the &s;ame proportion, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI> reciprocally. And hereupon is grounded the true ratio|nal Method of curing a <HI>Diarrhoea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sudorificks, Diureticks</HI> and <HI>Catharticks,</HI> and indeed all other Medicines univer&s;ally, will operate differently according to the different Con&s;titution in general, or the pre&s;ent occa&s;ional State of the <HI>Animal Oe|conomy,</HI> with regard to the primary <HI>Ele|mentary Qualities</HI> before mentioned. And here the different Powers of Heat and Cold, or of Rarefaction and Conden&s;ation, com|pared with the different &s;tate of the Solids and Fluids, or with the nature of the Di&s;|ea&s;e as Effluent or Influent, mu&s;t be the Phy&s;ician's Guide. Every one knows that heating and cooling, rarefying and conden|&s;ing Medicines, will either promote or re|&s;train <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> and <HI>Sweat,</HI> in their place and turns, or under different Circum|&s;tances. No Man therefore, who knows
<PB N="74" REF="79">what he is about, would attempt to promote <HI>Sweat</HI> and <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> by heating rarefy|ing <HI>Volatiles,</HI> where the cutaneous Di&s;char|ges had been ob&s;tructed and retained by a too great Efflux and diffu&s;ion of Heat before; or endeavour to promote this Evacuation, by cooling refrigerating <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Acids,</HI> in a low, languid, and depre&s;s'd State of the Blood and Animal Fluids. And yet, as wrong and irrational as this evidently ap|pears to be, any Per&s;on, who is but mode|rately acquainted with the Modern Practi|cal Phy&s;ical Writers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the <HI>Specifick</HI> Way, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that very little regard has been had in Prac|tice, e&s;pecially in <HI>Fevers,</HI> to this plain, obvious, and indi&s;putable Principle. <HI>Sudo|rificks</HI> and <HI>Diaphoreticks,</HI> therefore, ought to be of one Sort or the other, or the Sim|ples of each kind variou&s;ly compounded, in extemporaneous Practice, from a careful and judicious Ob&s;ervation of the difference in the &s;imple, or complicated, Symptoms. And this farther &s;hews the vanity and ab|&s;urdity of Stated <HI>Canonical Compounds,</HI> or <HI>General Recipes,</HI> under the infinite diver|&s;ity and various complications of Di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="75" REF="80">and their Symptoms. But yet I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding the general Doctrine here laid down, that there is one Preparation of Nature, &s;o nicely tempered and adju&s;ted with re&s;pect to Heating and Cooling, that, in this intention o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> promoting <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> and <HI>Sweat,</HI> and thereby carrying off the foulne&s;&s;es and impurities of the Glands, by the cutaneous Emunctories, is almo&s;t univer|&s;ally Beneficial: What I mean here is <HI>Opi|um,</HI> which, at all Times, and almo&s;t in all Ca&s;es, greatly promotes the <HI>Sudorifick</HI> and <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> Indications, whether the ge|neral Intention, and the Medicines with which it is join'd, be otherwi&s;e Heating or Cooling, Rarefying or Conden&s;ing.</P>
<P>BUT, where <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> and <HI>Sweating</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary, and the Intention cannot o|therwi&s;e be obtained, which often happens in Fevers, nothing can come into competi|tion with <HI>Bli&s;tering,</HI> which is not only a &s;afe, but a &s;ure, Refuge on &s;uch occa&s;ions. And this is &s;o effectual to the purpo&s;e here mentioned, that 'tis great pity it &s;hould ever be made the la&s;t Re&s;ort, after other Methods have been tryed in vain, and when,
<PB N="76" REF="81">perhaps this may come too late; e&s;pecially &s;ince, in the modern Method of directing and governing it, the mo&s;t dreaded and u&s;ual mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences of this O|peration are &s;o ea&s;ily prevented.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this Section, I &s;hall only make one Ob&s;ervation more, as a Matter of great importance; and that is, that the <HI>Metalline Salts,</HI> or &s;uch as are prepared by impreg|nating and incorporating Metals, e&s;pecial|ly <HI>Iron</HI> and <HI>Copper,</HI> with their proper di&s;|&s;olving <HI>Men&s;truums</HI> whether <HI>Acid</HI> or <HI>Al|kaline,</HI> are in many great Ca&s;es the mo&s;t effectual Remedies of all; as they may be directed to any of the natural Emunctories, by a skilful and judicious management, and become, then, the mo&s;t certain and effica|cious Di&s;&s;olvents, Deob&s;truents and Deter|gents of any thing yet known. But a full Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this cannot fall within the Bounds of a &s;hort E&s;&s;ay, tho' &s;omething farther will be ob&s;erved upon it in the following Sections.</P>

<P>'TIS certain that &s;ome &s;orts of Sub|&s;tances, which are in them&s;elves in|dige&s;tible, and which can by no means pa&s;s the Lacteals, or mix with the Blood, do yet mo&s;t powerfully attract, imbibe, and re|tain the morbid <HI>Salts, Acids,</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs</HI> or <HI>Inflammatory Oil</HI> which is often thrown on the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, in Fevers and other Di&s;ea&s;es of the putrefactive kind. And, on this account, &s;uch &s;ort of Medicines may be of great u&s;e in Phy&s;ick, provided that &s;ufficient care be taken to extrude them out of the Body, as &s;oon as they have done their work, and &s;aturated them&s;elves with the morbid Matter.

But nothing &s;urely can be more irrational and ab&s;urd, than the giving &s;uch Medicines under the notion of their Dige&s;tibility and alterative Effects in the Blood; as if the Stomach could work
<PB N="78" REF="83">Miracles and, by its natural Heat and Mo|tion, di&s;&s;olve that which no Art can do by degrees of Heat and Motion va&s;tly great|er. And be&s;ides, if &s;uch Sub&s;tances were &s;uppo&s;ed capable of being di&s;&s;olved and li|quifyed in the Stomach, &s;o as to be &s;train'd off through the Lacteals and Lymphatick Recipients, yet &s;till, as in this Ca&s;e they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily carry the morbid <HI>Fomes</HI> a|long with them, which they had before imbib'd and retained, and thereby corrupt and poy&s;on the whole Ma&s;s; &s;o con&s;equent|ly the Practice, in this view, would be rather more ab&s;urd and irrational than before.</P>
<P>IT may be here ob&s;erved, that &s;uch &s;ort of Sub&s;tances are the be&s;t <HI>Ab&s;orbents</HI> as are good for nothing el&s;e, and have no other remarkable Property what&s;oever. Such as <HI>Chalk,</HI> dry <HI>Earths,</HI> powdered <HI>Shells,</HI> burnt <HI>Harts-horn,</HI> and the <HI>Mineral Glebes</HI> which have been fir&s;t deprived of their <HI>Salts, Sulphurs</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> or &s;tript of their active Qualities, by proper chemical Proce&s;&s;es, &s;uch as <HI>Diaphoretick Antimony, Mineral Bezoar,</HI> &amp;c. I can|not therefore wholly condemn the&s;e things,
<PB N="79" REF="84">as of no u&s;e at all in Phy&s;ick, e&s;pecially the <HI>Minerals</HI> before mentioned, as &s;ome very con&s;iderable Phy&s;icians have done, particu|larly that Prince of the Faculty the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Learned Boerhaave,</HI> becau&s;e they could find them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no active Qualities, and could ea&s;ily prove them to be ab&s;olutely indige&s;tible, and indi&s;&s;oluble in the Stomach, by the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t convincing Expe|riments. For notwith&s;tanding their Pa&s;&s;ive|ne&s;s in other Re&s;pects, yet, 'tis certain, they &s;till retain the common Power of Attrac|tion. And as they attract, ab&s;orb, and re|tain <HI>Salts, Acids</HI> and <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> with the greater force and efficacy, for having been deprived and dive&s;ted of them before; &s;o, in this way of preparation of them, they may, I think, be de&s;ervedly reckoned &s;ome of the mo&s;t efficacious <HI>Ab&s;orbents</HI> in the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> But then, when the U&s;e of &s;uch indige&s;tible Sub&s;tances is too long continued, which it always mu&s;t be when they are directed under the Notion of <HI>Alte|ratives;</HI> or, where they are too long retain|ed in the Body, and due care is not taken to get rid of them, as &s;oon as they have an|&s;wered their Intention; they mu&s;t necc&s;&s;a|rily
<PB N="80" REF="85">produce Effects very mi&s;chievous to the Con&s;titution, and &s;uch as may, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, be ab&s;olutely Irretrievable. And herein Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations and Rea&s;onings, upon this Subject, are certainly right.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of Deobstruents.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>DEOBSTRUENTS</HI> act by attenu|ating, liquifying, and deterging or carrying off the vi&s;cid Concretions of Mat|ter, lodged in the Ventricles of the Glands and Membranous Cells, throughout the whole Body, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Me&s;entery, and <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> which are mo&s;t liable to be thus ob&s;tructed, and where the Ob&s;tructions are commonly the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and invincible.</P>
<P>IN all Ca&s;es of <HI>Ob&s;tructions,</HI> great re|gard is to be had to the Nature and Qua|lity of the ob&s;tructing and retained Matter; as whether it be a cold, &s;luggi&s;h, indurated <HI>Phlegm,</HI> or a heating, acrid, concreted <HI>Oil</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="86">and <HI>Salt.</HI> And as this is nothing, but ob|&s;erving the Primary <HI>Elementary Qualities,</HI> in the Con&s;titution of every Di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o it is only to be known, by carefully regard|ing the general Temperament of the Pa|tient, the antecedent Cau&s;es by which the Ob&s;truction may have been brought on, and the particular Symptoms and Appearan|ces of the pre&s;ent morbid Con&s;titution. And this Di&s;tinction is of &s;uch Con&s;equence, that all true Practice depends upon it.</P>
<P>IN all Ob&s;tructions occa&s;ioned by a cold, unactive, indurated <HI>Lymph</HI> or <HI>Phlegm,</HI> where the Complexion is pale, the Pul&s;e low, the natural dige&s;tive Heat impaired, and the Serum of the Blood very much abounding, in proportion to the Cra&s;&s;a|ment; in &s;uch Ca&s;es, I &s;ay, <HI>Steel,</HI> join'd with the warm <HI>Bitters</HI> and <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> is a great and noble <HI>Deob&s;truent.</HI> It rai&s;es the Pul&s;e, &s;trengthens the Dige&s;tion, diffu|&s;es the natural Heat, re&s;tores the ela&s;tick Tone of the Arteries, and, in a little time recovers the Cra&s;&s;ament of the Blood to a wonder, after it had been almo&s;t quite lo&s;t and run into Water.</P>
<PB N="82" REF="87">
<P>BUT, on the other hand, when the Ob|&s;tructions are occa&s;ioned by a hot, acrid, concreted <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI> tending to Ero&s;ion and Ulceration, or where the natural Heat is exce&s;&s;ive, and the Cra&s;&s;ament of the Blood is very predominant in proportion to the Serum. <HI>Steel,</HI> in this Ca&s;e, can hard|ly be born at all, and will be &s;ure to do more Hurt than Good. For as <HI>Steel</HI> is in|di&s;putably one of the warme&s;t <HI>Deob&s;truents</HI> in the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> &s;o, it is from thence evident, it can have no place as a Medicine here, and can only, then, be proper, when the Ob&s;truction proceeds from a contrary Cau&s;e, or, a cold, acid, <HI>Conden&s;ative Coa|gulation;</HI> and, in this Ca&s;e, it is <HI>in&s;tar om|nium</HI> and has not its equal.</P>
<P>BUT the great univer&s;al <HI>Deob&s;truent,</HI> which may be accommodated to all Ca&s;es and &s;uited to all Con&s;titutions, is <HI>Mercury</HI> or Quick&s;ilver, which is de&s;ervedly &s;til'd by <HI>Bello&s;te</HI> a <HI>Miracle of Nature,</HI> and <HI>the greate&s;t Gift of Providence in the whole Materia Medica.</HI> This noble and divine Medicament, being fir&s;t well clean&s;ed and purifyed from its original <HI>Ar&s;enical Sul|phur,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="88">and all other <HI>Artificial Heterogene|ous</HI> Mixtures and Impurities, may be given, with the greate&s;t &s;afety, to the younge&s;t, tendere&s;t and mo&s;t delicate Subjects: And, when under a skilful Management, may be directed to any of the natural Emunctories, &s;o as to prove <HI>Sudorifick, Cathartick, Di|uretick, Expectorating</HI> or <HI>Salivatory,</HI> in a|ny degree, according to the Nature, Con|&s;titution and Appearances of Di&s;ea&s;es, and their various Indications and Intentions of Cure: And this I can confidently affirm, from my own Experience, in repeated Try|als of it upon my Self and others, for a Cour&s;e of many Years together. I confe&s;s indeed, that I have never yet ob&s;erv'd any great or &s;en&s;ible Effects from it, beyond the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, when taken by Ounces at a time, in the <HI>Vulgar</HI> Method and <HI>Quack</HI> way of Pre&s;cription: And notwith&s;tanding the Facts publi&s;hed, in the Controver&s;y on this Subject, which &s;eem to prove the con|trary; yet, I am &s;till of Opinion that the Relief obtained, in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, was purely accidental, and owing rather to the ca&s;ual Separation and Divi&s;ion of &s;ome part of the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> into its <HI>Minuti&s;&s;ima,</HI> in its
<PB N="84" REF="89">Pa&s;&s;age thro' the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, from the long continued repetition of the Do&s;es, than to any natural or nece&s;&s;ary Com|minution of it, by the dige&s;tive Heat and mu&s;cular Action of tho&s;e <HI>Organs.</HI> But, however it be, thus much, I think, is cer|tain, that it does not &s;o quickly, ea&s;ily and &s;urely pa&s;s the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> in that way of ex|habiting it, as when 'tis antecedently divided by Art, and intimately combined and in|corporated with other Bodies: And, in this way of Management, I may venture to af|firm, it will &s;eldom or never di&s;appoint the judicious Phy&s;ician's Intention, even in Di&s;|ea&s;es of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate <HI>Chronick</HI> kind, where any Relief is rea&s;onably to be hoped for or expected. But a particular Con&s;i|deration of this Matter, would open one into too large a Field for a &s;hort E&s;&s;ay, &s;uch as I only intend this to be. And be&s;ides, as I can give the World &s;ome A&s;&s;urance of &s;eeing this Subject more thoroughly hand|led by an abler Pen, I &s;hall chu&s;e to re|fer to that Treati&s;e which, I believe, will be &s;oon publi&s;hed, and in which, I am confi|dent, the Reader will find his Account.</P>
<PB N="85" REF="90">
<P>I &s;hall therefore conclude this Section with one Remark more, by way of Caution to the <HI>Quick&s;ilver Devourers,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as take va&s;t quantities of it out of mere Whim and Wantonne&s;s, which is this; That tho' <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> be in it &s;elf, perhaps, the mo&s;t innocent thing in Nature, and ab&s;olutely incapable of hurting the mo&s;t delicate Con&s;titution, if taken pure and in moderate Quantities; yet, &s;ince it will in|timately mix and incorporate with other Metals, e&s;pecially <HI>Lead</HI> with which it is but too commonly adulterated, and which it will &s;o &s;trongly attract and retain, as not to be &s;eparated from it again by any &s;ort of <HI>Straining,</HI> or other manual Operation: I &s;ay, &s;ince this is the Ca&s;e, it may be worth &s;uch Per&s;ons while to con&s;ider, whe|ther <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> thus &s;ophi&s;ticated, with a Metal endued with &s;uch noxious Quali|ties, may not, in a long Cour&s;e of taking it, become a <HI>Slow Poy&s;on,</HI> and do more future Mi&s;chief to the Con&s;titution, than can be ballanced by any pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ible Relief or Advantage what&s;oever.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="91">
<P>FOR my own part, I freely acknowledge, I dare not give it, even in &s;mall Quantities, for a long Time together, without being well a&s;&s;ured of its Purity. And tho' a Per|&s;on of Judgment may pretty well di&s;cover, upon view, from the degree of its <HI>Lu&s;tre, Poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Fluidity,</HI> whether it be greatly adulterated or not; yet, I am very &s;ure, from a great number of Experiments, that a &s;ufficient quantity of noxious Particles may be &s;o intimately blended with, and re|tain'd by it, as not only to deceive the ni|ce&s;t Eye, and elude all other Methods of Tryal, &s;hort of the <HI>Fiery One,</HI> but to do a great deal of Mi&s;chief, in a long Cour&s;e of taking it in &s;urplus Quantities according to the common Way: for which Rea&s;on, I never pre&s;cribe <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> but as <HI>Re|viv'd</HI> from <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> or <HI>Redi&s;tilled,</HI> accord|ing to Art, after it is got into the Apothe|cary's Hands.</P>
<P>I had here &s;ome Thoughts of con&s;idering the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> more particularly, in another Section, and of ranging and di&s;po|&s;ing the mo&s;t approv'd and efficacious Sim|ples,
<PB N="87" REF="92">in their mo&s;t natural and proper Or|der. But I mu&s;t po&s;tpone this, to another Opportunity, for the Rea&s;ons already gi|ven; and the rather becau&s;e I intend, one Day or other, if I have Time and Lei&s;ure to make the nece&s;&s;ary Experiments, to trou|ble the World with a new <HI>Pharmacopoeia</HI> upon this Plan, in which I propo&s;e, accu|rately, to re-examine the whole <HI>Materia Me|dica,</HI> both <HI>Chemically</HI> and <HI>Mechanically,</HI> and to di&s;po&s;e the mo&s;t efficacious Simples in every Intention, in di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es, ac|cording to their mo&s;t Obvious <HI>Sen&s;ible Powers</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> with regard to the Primary <HI>Elementary Qualities</HI> and <HI>Natu|ral Evacuations:</HI> And to place them in &s;uch a natural Order, according to their different Degrees of Power and Force in each Intention, that none but <HI>Empyricks,</HI> or &s;uch as have little or no acquaintance with Philo&s;ophy, and the Animal Structure and Oeconomy, &s;hall be ea&s;ily capable of erring in the U&s;e and Application of them.</P>
<P>IN this <HI>Examen,</HI> the Reader, I believe, fore&s;ees that the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> which, in its pre&s;ent State is enormou&s;ly Bulky,
<PB N="88" REF="93">will be greatly reduced and brought into a very narrow Compa&s;s. But, however, be|cau&s;e I would give no Offence to any Gen|tlemen of the Faculty, e&s;pecially the <HI>Speci|ficians,</HI> who may po&s;&s;ibly think them&s;elves Neglected, if not Injured, by this Method of treating the Subject; I farther intend, for their U&s;e, and the Entertainment of others, tho' it will co&s;t me no &s;mall Pains, to take due notice of the remaining <HI>Simples,</HI> which, for want of proper <HI>Criteria,</HI> cannot be en|titled to a Place in the rational Part of this <HI>Pharmacopoeia;</HI> and which have no claim to any Regard or E&s;teem at all, but on the Foot of <HI>Magick</HI> and <HI>Specifici&s;m.</HI> The&s;e I &s;hall place in oppo&s;ite Columns, and in di&s;|tinct <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> likewi&s;e, according to their Traditional <HI>Occult Virtues</HI> and <HI>Qualities</HI> from the be&s;t Authorities. By this way of proceeding, the true State of the Contro|ver&s;y between the <HI>Mechanical</HI> and <HI>Speci|fick</HI> Gentlemen will at once be exhibited to View; and, if I am not much mi&s;taken, will appear in &s;o &s;trong a Light, that a Man of no great Abilities may ea&s;ily de|termine on which Side the Weight of the Argument lies: And whether the <HI>Newto|nian
<PB N="89" REF="94">Philo&s;opher,</HI> who confines his Rea|&s;onings to plain Facts and ju&s;t Experiments, or the <HI>Corpu&s;cularian</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;icrucian,</HI> who is led by his Imagination into all the Lengths of Whim&s;y and Enthu&s;ia&s;m, is like to prove the better and more u&s;eful Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>UNDER this Article likewi&s;e, it will clearly appear, from the manife&s;t Contra|diction of the Authorities produced in the cour&s;e of the Evidence, that for one true Fact, upon Record, in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Spe|cifici&s;m,</HI> you have ten Fal&s;ities; that the Argument, therefore, from <HI>Authority</HI> only, has as little Weight in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> as in <HI>Divi|nity;</HI> and con&s;equently, that the <HI>Free-Thinker,</HI> in the one Profe&s;&s;ion as well as in the other, has ten times a better chance of being in the Right, in all Ca&s;es what|&s;oever, than the <HI>Free-Believer</HI> or <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;t.</HI></P>
