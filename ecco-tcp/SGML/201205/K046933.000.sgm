<P>THE great reputation which Dr. <HI>Hoffman</HI> has de&s;erved|ly acquired by his &s;uperior abilities and long experience in his profe&s;&s;ion, has made his writings univer&s;ally known and e&s;teemed by the learned.</P>
<P>This treati&s;e being intended for general u&s;e, he has wrote with more plainne&s;s, and with as few terms of &s;cience as po&s;&s;ible, to render it generally u&s;eful, as the &s;ubject he

<HEAD>A TREATISE OF THE Extraordinay Virtues and Effects of ASSES MILK.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who have had a long and careful experience in the practice of phy&s;ic, have a better opportu|nity than the re&s;t of mankind of ob&s;erving that the plaine&s;t &s;orts of remedies, tho&s;e which are mo&s;t readily prepared, and as it were at hand in every family, are highly preferable to all kinds of compounds, and artificial mixtures of drugs what&s;oever; not only in regard to the &s;afety in u&s;ing them, but likewi&s;e in their real virtue and efficacy; whether they be intended to thoroughly &s;ub|due, or put a timely &s;top to all the various kinds of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="11">
<P>IF we diligently revi&s;e the be&s;t writings of phy&s;icians in the earlie&s;t ages, we &s;hall find that they met with greater &s;ucce&s;s, and wrought more cures with the mo&s;t &s;imple and ea&s;y medicines, &s;uch as are quite agree|able to nature, &s;uch as only require a re|gulation in diet, and have a greater &s;hare of nouri&s;hment than of phy&s;ic in them, than the chemi&s;ts of later times can effect with their ine&s;timable &s;ecrets, and &s;ubtle compo&s;itions, produced by the force of fire. For all the&s;e, unle&s;s admini&s;tered with the nice&s;t care and di&s;cretion, in&s;tead of doing &s;ervice, are &s;ure to do much mi&s;chief; and therefore mu&s;t be e&s;teemed very dangerous, and far le&s;s eligible than tho&s;e family reme|dies that may be u&s;ed without any hazard at all.</P>
<P>UNDOUBTEDLY the refined art of che|mi&s;try, which brings to light the various mixtures and properties of natural &s;ub&s;tances, de&s;erves a very great and peculiar degree of admiration; and the experiment is very &s;ur|pri&s;ing of the chemi&s;ts, who are able to re|lieve the &s;ufferings of their patients with a few drops only, or a very &s;mall pill: yet
<PB N="3" REF="12">when the larger or more plentiful prepara|tions of what are called Galenical medicines are rejected, when no regard is &s;hewn to the &s;afe a&s;&s;i&s;tance of regulated diets, &s;o much re|commended by the antients, and medicines altogether chemical, are almo&s;t univer&s;ally u&s;ed again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es; the effect is, that the practice of phy&s;ic is become far more dangerous in our days, than it was formerly, and gets di&s;credit by more frequent in&s;tances of the lo&s;s of patients. For my own part, I was always guided by the following rule; that the only way to gain a happy and &s;uc|ce&s;sful method in the healing art, is con|tinually to unite theory with practice, the experience of the antients with that of the moderns, and Galenical and dome&s;tic reme|dies with chemical. For I have di&s;covered by a long improved experience, that reme|dies which have blended in them the powers of both nouri&s;hment and phy&s;ic, and are therefore plea&s;ant and refre&s;hing to the frame of our bodies, are not only the &s;afe&s;t, but the mo&s;t efficacious in the cure and preven|tion of di&s;ea&s;es. And it is undeniable that the u&s;e and propere&s;t method of admini&s;tring the&s;e, is more exactly to be learnt from the
<PB N="4" REF="13">remains of the antients authors, than from the works of the moderns, or even of &s;uch of the moderns as have plainly a fondne&s;s and partiality for the antients.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t eminent and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in&s;tances of what I thus a&s;&s;ert is A&s;&s;es milk: which, indeed, was &s;trenuou&s;ly re|commended by the antient phy&s;icians, and e&s;teemed of &s;overeign benefit in rooting out the ob&s;tinate remains of the mo&s;t grievous di&s;tempers; yet mo&s;t of our later phy&s;icians, in other re&s;pects men of high repute, are very ignorant of its mo&s;t excellent quali|ties, and therefore were either &s;o cautious, as &s;eldom to introduce into their practice this de&s;irable promoter of health, or actually were afraid to u&s;e it at all. In the following treati&s;e therefore I intend, by fair and ju&s;t arguments, founded on an exten&s;ive expe|rience, to &s;et forth all the admirable virtues of A&s;&s;es milk, which have &s;o long been ab|&s;olutely forgotten and unknown.</P>
<P>BUT before we come immediately to the &s;ubject, it is not improper previou&s;ly to &s;hew in general, that all milk is a &s;ort of
<PB N="5" REF="14">food that has a &s;ingular medicinal virtue belonging to it, without con&s;idering its re|markable nouri&s;hing quality; which very weighty rea&s;ons &s;hould recommend its being medicinally u&s;ed. That milk has this nu|tritive quality, mu&s;t I think be readily al|lowed by all, as it appears con&s;tantly to every man, by his own experience, to be parti|cularly con&s;tituted and adapted to the &s;up|port of our bodies. The unborn child, while yet inclo&s;ed in the womb, grows and is nouri&s;hed by milk, which is prepared for it in the &s;tructure of the &s;ecundines. When it is born, it acquires &s;till additional firm|ne&s;s from a &s;upply of milk; is gradually wrought up to its perfect form; and all its inward parts gain &s;o much more &s;trength in proportion as they are able to alter and di|ge&s;t whatever food they take in, and reduce them to the milky juice called <HI>chyle.</HI> La&s;tly, every man, &s;o long as he remains alive, re|ceives his whole nouri&s;hment and vigour from chyle, which is extracted from the food dige&s;ted and di&s;&s;olved, and is in truth no other than milk. It is milk that &s;upplies the principles and materials, not of the blood
<PB N="6" REF="15">alone, but of all the fluids that cheri&s;h and &s;u&s;tain life.</P>
<P>SINCE then milk is &s;o manife&s;tly proved to be the principal of all the kinds of ali|ment; &s;o it may be de&s;ervedly reckoned the chief of all remedies. Which, though it may not &s;eem clear and evident to others, may be proved to demon&s;tration with very little difficulty. To begin then with expe|rience, the be&s;t instructor in all things, and what is &s;uperior to all the mo&s;t refined &s;pe|culations.</P>
<P>No man, that has cultivated ever &s;o &s;light an acquaintance with the medicinal art, can be ignorant that the milk of almo&s;t all ani|mals has a very powerful and marvellous efficacy in tempering, &s;ubduing, and dimi|nishing the force of the &s;tronge&s;t poi&s;ons, whether they come from the kingdom of minerals, animals, or plants, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a corro&s;ive kind, that are mo&s;t remark|able for fatal execution. And &s;o great is this efficacy, that any per&s;on, who has taken poi&s;on, by a &s;ea&s;onable u&s;e of milk in a proper method and quantity, will be &s;ure to
<PB N="7" REF="16">e&s;cape immediate death, and recover perfect health. On which account it may be rea|&s;onably que&s;tioned, whether there be any more ready and prevalent antidote to be found in the whole works of nature. And the mo&s;t antient and early writers in me|dicine both knew and de&s;cribed the cer|tain virtue of milk again&s;t poi&s;ons. <HI>Dio&s;|&s;corides,</HI> the mo&s;t ancient writer concerning the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> &s;ays, that milk, if fre&s;h and new, is &s;erviceable again&s;t corro&s;ions and inflammations occa&s;ioned by deadly poi&s;ons, &s;uch as cantharides, pityocampa, &s;alamandra, or bupre&s;te, orpiment, dorycnium, aconite, or ephemeron. And <HI>Pliny</HI> repeats almo&s;t the very &s;ame account.</P>
<P>IF we enquire into the treatment of di&s;|ea&s;es them&s;elves, it will appear that milk was frequently and &s;ucce&s;sfully employed again&s;t them, from numberle&s;s te&s;timonies and examples to be found in many late au|thors, in common with tho&s;e antient physi|cians <HI>Hippocrates, Galen, Cel&s;us,</HI> and the <HI>Arabian</HI> writers. This will be more largely illu&s;trated when we proceed to the &s;ubject of a&s;&s;es milk. At pre&s;ent let it &s;uffice to
<PB N="8" REF="17">produce what we read in <HI>Martian,</HI><Q>"That heretofore milk was e&s;teemed the &s;acred anchor and foundation of all remedies: &s;o that there was &s;carce any di&s;temper in which milk was not made u&s;e of."</Q> The &s;ame is atte&s;ted by <HI>Jo. Jac. Wepfer,</HI> an eminent author, and noble ornament of the faculty among the <HI>Dutch.</HI><Q>"There is &s;urely &s;ome divine quality belonging to milk. Formerly I could not have believed it, had I not had convincing experience of it. Mine own eyes have &s;een men intirely renewed by it. For by a di&s;creet u&s;e of it, multitudes have acquired a &s;ounder con&s;ti|tution, more hale complexion, and greater &s;trength of body."</Q></P>
<P>BUT though the milk that is generally u&s;ed in the medicinal way, is that of the common dome&s;tick &s;orts of animals, as cows, &s;heep, and goats; yet a&s;&s;es milk is by far the mo&s;t efficacious, and its virtues in phy&s;ic exceed tho&s;e of every other &s;pecies &s;o much, that no &s;ort of remedy is to be di&s;covered &s;o &s;afe, and &s;o powerful in its effects. For this, taken at &s;ea&s;onable times, in due quantities, and with a proper regimen, gives eminent
<PB N="9" REF="18">relief to &s;uch as are afflicted with phthi&s;ics, hectics, con&s;umption and &s;low con&s;uming fevers, chronical coughs, and a &s;corbutic atrophy, hypochondriac and hy&s;teric di&s;orders, cramps, ulcers in the bowels, and di&s;ea&s;es that proceed from a &s;aline acrid ero&s;ion. This consideration induced me to fix upon this &s;ort of milk, above all others, for the &s;ubject of my ob&s;ervations, in order to &s;et forth its powers and properties, to demon|&s;trate its u&s;efulne&s;s, and confirm it by te&s;|timonies and examples.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign the rea|&s;on why A&s;&s;es milk is to be preferred in me|dicine, before that of other creatures. Which may be done in a more convincing and &s;a|tisfactory manner, if we previou&s;ly lay down &s;ome certain &s;tated propo&s;itions, concerning the compo&s;ition of milk, and tho&s;e ingre|dients which are the foundation of all its operations. It is univer&s;ally known that milk con&s;i&s;ts of three different &s;ub&s;tances, each of which has a different quality and powers peculiar to it&s;elf. The fir&s;t is the fluid part, commonly called <HI>&s;erum,</HI> or <HI>whey.</HI> The next is the oily fat part, which exhibits it&s;elf in cream
<PB N="10" REF="19">on the &s;urface, and is to be wrought into butter. The third is of a coar&s;er nature, earthy and mucilaginous in its texture, and of this chee&s;e is formed. The &s;erum, or watry portion, exceeds the others in quan|tity, &s;o that in different milks, there will be found eight or ten parts of this fluid, to one only of &s;olid. The butter, or oily fat &s;ub|&s;tance is the lighte&s;t, and the lea&s;t in quan|tity, and inflammable in its nature. And la&s;tly the curd is of a more fixed and heavy temper, is very readily hardened by acids, and &s;ub&s;ides to the bottom in the &s;ub&s;tance of chee&s;e.</P>
<P>THE efficacy of every &s;ort of milk in curing and &s;ubduing any di&s;ea&s;e, is derived from this threefold nature of the ingredients that con&s;titute the &s;ub&s;tance of milk. For that milk which is thin and liquid, and con|tains a larger proportion of &s;erum, is prefer|able for its faculty of moi&s;tening, diluting, clean&s;ing and relaxing. Again, that which is heavier, and has much of the gro&s;s &s;ub|&s;tance of curd, is valuable for its excellence in hardening, confirming and con&s;olidating the broken ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="20">
<P>BUT that which produces a great &s;hare of cream, and likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable quan|tity of the curd-like &s;ub&s;tance, is eminent for its &s;oftening, &s;moothening, and nou|ri&s;hing quality. If we examine the diffe|rent &s;pecies of milks that are in common and daily u&s;e; the human is the &s;weete&s;t of all, of a very &s;oft and rich temperature, and is the be&s;t accommodated for the nutriment of the human body. That of cows is fatter, has more of the earthy and le&s;s of the watery &s;ub&s;tance, and is therefore le&s;s fitted for clean&s;ing the ve&s;&s;els, but be&s;t formed for &s;oftening, tempering and nouri&s;hing. Sheeps milk is the mo&s;t gro&s;s, and very full of the earthy mucilaginous curd; whence it has little of a clean&s;ing power, but is extremely u&s;eful for clo&s;ing up &s;uch blood ve&s;&s;els, or lymphaticks, as are injur'd and corroded by acrid humours. Goats milk has very little &s;erum, and is of a pretty thick and a&s;trin|gent con&s;i&s;tence, produces very little butter, yet is more clean&s;ing and diluting than cows milk.</P>
<P>THIS different proportion in the ingre|dients of milk, and the difference of beneficial
<PB N="12" REF="21">effects ari&s;ing therefrom, is not &s;o much to be a&s;cribed to the food of the animals, (of which more largely hereafter,) as to the different texture and conformation of their bodies. For tho' we were to feed the various milch-crea|tures with the &s;ame &s;ort of food, for the &s;ame length of time, and in the &s;ame manner in all re&s;pects, yet would they not give milk of one and the &s;ame nature, but each of its own and peculiar kind. It is therefore a very evi|dent truth, that the matter and quality of the food conduces but little towards the forma|tion of milk, but that it is altogether brought to perfection by the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">culiar nature of the animal, which con&s;i&s;t in a di&s;tinct compo|&s;ition and texture of the fluids, (namely, the temperature of the blood and other juices,) and a particular make, &s;tructure, and con|&s;titution of the &s;olids, e&s;pecially of the glands belonging to the udder, which are com|po&s;ed of numberle&s;s fine ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>WHEN we examine more minutely into the medicinal virtue and di&s;po&s;ition of A&s;&s;es milk, it will appear to be fraught with an abundance of peculiar excellencies which render it &s;o exceedingly whole&s;ome. In the
<PB N="13" REF="22">fir&s;t place, it is thinner than all other milks, and abounds with watery and &s;erous ingredi|ents. This is what <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Galen</HI> have both ob&s;erved, who call it <GAP DESC="foreign">, com|po&s;ed of the minute&s;t particles. Since then it is known that many di&s;ea&s;es are cau&s;ed by a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and tenacity of the juices, which, as they pa&s;s &s;lowly thro' the finer ve&s;&s;els, of which the principal emunctories and &s;train|ers of the glands con&s;i&s;t, are apt to &s;top in tho&s;e narrow pa&s;&s;ages, to fill them up, and occa&s;ion ob&s;tructions, it is very obvious and natural to conclude, that the u&s;e of A&s;&s;es milk, which abounds with &s;erous and fluid particles, mu&s;t be extremely proper to open the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els, to attenuate the gro&s;s and vi&s;cid juices, and &s;et them in an ea&s;y and free motion. Again, when we know that multitudes of di&s;tempers proceed from an acrid, &s;alt, and corro&s;ive &s;tate of the fluids, we cannot but be a&s;&s;ured that the thin &s;erum of A&s;&s;es-milk will not fail of diluting, &s;often|ing, and &s;ubduing them: altho' it mu&s;t be allowed at the &s;ame time, that the &s;weet oily &s;ub&s;tance contributes much toward this effect, which embraces and involves the pointed particles of &s;alt, and by this means the crude,
<PB N="14" REF="23">ill-dige&s;ted juices, being property corrected, are, by the plentiful a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;erum, con|vey'd in their due cour&s;e thro' the ve&s;&s;els ap|pointed for &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>IT is another extraordinary excellence of A&s;&s;es milk, that it contains but a &s;mall pro|portion of the gro&s;&s;er curdling &s;ub&s;tance. Out of eight ounces of A&s;&s;es milk which I &s;et over hot coals in a broad ve&s;&s;el, after all the &s;erum was evaporated, I could &s;carce ga|ther &s;o much as &s;ix drachms of a whiti&s;h &s;weet matter. I then took twelve ounces of the &s;ame milk, and &s;et it by to curdle in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, filled about half way. In three days time a very white and thin curd &s;ettled at the bottom, which when &s;eparated from the whey by &s;training thro' filtrating paper, and afterwards dried, &s;carce amounted to two drachms; all the re&s;t of its &s;olid parts having in part pa&s;&s;ed with the whey thro' the &s;trainer, and partly adhered to the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els, or lo&s;t them&s;elves in the opera|tion. On the contrary, the &s;ame weight of cows milk, treated in the &s;ame manner, thickened into a gro&s;&s;er and heavier curd, which when clear'd from the whey, &s;pread
<PB N="15" REF="24">out in a broad plate, and dried in the &s;un, weighed ten drachms. From the&s;e experi|ments it is evident, that the quantity of the gro&s;s curdling &s;ub&s;tance is very &s;mall in A&s;&s;es milk, when compared with other &s;orts. For this rea&s;on it ea&s;ily diffu&s;es it&s;elf into the mi|nute&s;t extremities of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, tho|roughly dilutes the vital juices, liquifies the &s;luggi&s;h humours, and when it has thus di&s;|&s;olved them conveys them off. A third cir|cum&s;tance that more &s;trongly evinces the &s;a|lubrious quality of A&s;&s;es milk, is, that the &s;hare of chee&s;e-like &s;ub&s;tance which it con|tains is extremely &s;oft and tender, and never makes a gro&s;s or firm curd. To make this evident, I warmed &s;ome A&s;&s;es milk, and &s;prinkled it with vinegar, expecting to &s;ee it contract a thick con&s;i&s;tence; but nothing appear'd of that &s;ort, except a few light thin flakes floating here and there on the &s;erum: when, on the contrary, cow's milk, the in|&s;tant it was mixed with an acid, conden&s;ed into lumps of a con&s;iderable hardne&s;s, and fell to the bottom. Now in all cures which are &s;ought by milk, nothing can be &s;o hurt|ful and dangerous as to have it curdle in the &s;tomach, to prevent which accident ought
<PB N="16" REF="25">to be the phy&s;icians principle care and con|cern. For the mi&s;chiefs occa&s;ioned by a coagulation of milk in the &s;tomach are very pernicious, and have been ob&s;erved and cau|tioned again&s;t by the be&s;t authors. It is pa&s;t di&s;pute therefore that that milk is the mo&s;t whol&s;ome and propere&s;t for medicinal u&s;es, which has lea&s;t tendency to curdle, which is the ca&s;e with A&s;&s;es milk in the mo&s;t re|markable degree.</P>
<P>A fourth, and the mo&s;t valuable excellence in A&s;&s;es milk, is its exqui&s;ite &s;weetne&s;s, in which it exceeds all other &s;pecies of milk, except the human: for you may extract from it by much the greate&s;t quantity of de|licate ta&s;ted &s;ugar, or rather a thick &s;ub&s;tance re&s;embling manna. To try the experiment, I boiled twelve ounces of A&s;&s;es milk, in the month of July, over a gentle fire, and im|mediately it produced a thick concretion very &s;weet, weighing one ounce. Upon this I poured it into a gla&s;s with a pint of rain water, which when frequently &s;haken al|mo&s;t di&s;&s;olved the ma&s;s, leaving only a &s;mall &s;ediment. The liquor was then poured through filtrating paper, and &s;et to evaporate,
<PB N="17" REF="26">and yielded half an ounce of an honey-like &s;ub&s;tance, extremely &s;weet, and white. As A&s;&s;es milk therefore contains &s;o plentiful a proportion of &s;weet &s;alts, we cannot doubt but it has for that rea&s;on a very &s;ingular me|dicinal quality which cannot be expected in other kinds of milk. For this honey-like &s;alt greatly &s;oftens, checks and moderates the acrimony of humours, whether acid or bi|lious, and by gently irritating the fibres of the bowels, urges them to their office and operation. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that A&s;&s;es milk di&s;po&s;es to purging more than any other. And in another place advi&s;es, as a remedy for the Fluor Albus, fir&s;t to occa&s;ion a gentle purging by drinking A&s;&s;es milk, and then to change it for cows milk.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e enlarged ob&s;ervations which we have made on the excellencies of A&s;&s;es milk, it mu&s;t be evident to all that judge &s;en&s;ibly, that it has an admirable efficacy towards curing many di&s;tempers. It may now be proper to enumerate tho&s;e di&s;tem|pers in regular order, and explain the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of this milk in each particular. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance we &s;hall
<PB N="18" REF="27">give, by proving that no &s;urer or more &s;uc|ce&s;sful remedy can be invented or recom|mended again&s;t <HI>con&s;umptions.</HI> The u&s;e of milk in &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es had long been practis'd, till the phy&s;ical &s;chools of Cnidos and Cos exploded it: at length <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who came from the latter, vindicated and e&s;tabli&s;hed its credit, and was univer&s;ally followed in it by all the phy&s;icians of the next age. <HI>Galen</HI> &s;ays a great deal in prai&s;e of milk in con&s;umptive ca&s;es; and &s;peaks of a place, called <HI>Stabia,</HI> very famous for its good air, pa&s;ture for cattle, and their whol&s;ome milk, which was filled frequently with crouds of con&s;umptive people that came thither for relief. And <HI>Aretaeus</HI> a&s;cribes &s;o extraordinary virtues to milk in this grievous di&s;temper, that he does not &s;cruple to affirm, that if con&s;umptive folks would drink great quantities of milk they would need no other remedy.</P>
<P>YET although milk of all kinds be a whol|&s;ome medicine in con&s;umptive and decaying con&s;titutions, yet A&s;&s;es milk excells the others in a greater degree, becau&s;e it fully an&s;wers every requisite that can conduce to the cure of con&s;umptions. If we &s;trictly enquire into
<PB N="19" REF="28">the cau&s;e and origin of a con&s;umption of the lungs, it will be found to proceed from a &s;toppage and ob&s;truction of the ve&s;&s;els, of which the lungs are almo&s;t entirely compo&s;ed. Whence <HI>Hippocrates</HI> very properly and inge|niou&s;ly de&s;cribes the ri&s;e of a con&s;umption in the&s;e words; <Q>"when the lungs have col|lected a quantity of blood, or &s;alt phlegm, and cannot di&s;charge them, but they &s;ettle and fix there, they occa&s;ion little pu&s;tules to ri&s;e; which &s;uppurate at fir&s;t; and thro' the whole di&s;temper there continues a &s;harp dry cough, chilline&s;s, a fever, a pain in the brea&s;t and back, and &s;ometimes a a &s;trong whee&s;ing both in lying down and &s;itting up, and then the patient begins to &s;pit up much corrupted matter."</Q>&mdash; It was u&s;ual with the ancients to vary their pre|&s;criptions of milk for con&s;umptions, and &s;ometimes order A&s;&s;es milk before, and &s;ome|times after the u&s;e of other milk, as different occa&s;ions required. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> advi&s;es purg|ing with A&s;&s;es milk boiled (or Mares milk &s;trained, which much re&s;embles A&s;&s;es milk) and drank every morning to the quantity of about a quart; after which he recommends cows milk, or goats.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="29">
<P>PROSPER ALPINUS greatly recommends the u&s;e of woman's milk at fir&s;t, then A&s;&s;es, and la&s;tly goats, in a con&s;umption and ulceration of the lungs. For my part, I am convinced both from rea&s;on and expe|rience, that A&s;&s;es milk alone is &s;ufficient for the cure of this terrible di&s;ea&s;e. For no|thing can be &s;o properly adapted as this is, by its abundance of &s;weet deter&s;ive &s;alts, to clean&s;e away and di&s;per&s;e the matter that ob&s;tructs the ve&s;&s;els and pipes of the lungs. Be&s;ides, it greatly re&s;tores decay'd &s;trength, cools the heat of the inte&s;tines, fills out the wa&s;ted limbs, and pre&s;erves a free and open per&s;piration. Yet I do not deny, but when the ob&s;truction of the ve&s;&s;els in the lungs is cured, cows milk or goats, by rea&s;on of their plenty of gro&s;s, earthy &s;ub&s;tance, may be proper to fill up and con&s;olidate the cavi|ties made by the corro&s;ive ulcers.</P>
<P>IF I may be allowed to produce my own experience, I could recount many in&s;tances of con&s;umptive people, who were afflicted with an ob&s;tinate cough, a fever, a great di&s;charge of vi&s;cid matter from the lungs,
<PB N="21" REF="30">and an amazing wa&s;te of the whole body; and who, after an ineffectual trial of other remedies, by my directions took to a long continued cour&s;e of A&s;&s;es milk, or cows milk, (either with or without &s;ome &s;ort of tea,) and perfectly recovered. But omitting others, I &s;hall only relate one very late ca&s;e, which is now fre&s;h in my memory: <HI>A man, about thirty years old,</HI> of a <HI>very debauched life,</HI> and given to all kinds of intemperance, e&s;pe|cially drinking of &s;pirituous liquors, fir&s;t fell into a &s;pitting of blood, which being cured, tho' after a long continuance, he contracted a fever, which at fir&s;t had the appearance of a defluxion, but at length con&s;umed his &s;trength, and afflicted him night and day. He continually &s;pit up a great di&s;charge of purulent and vi&s;cid matter, his &s;trength failed, and his fle&s;h wa&s;ted &s;o &s;peedily, that he could not walk about, and was given over by every body. Yet, after he had laid three months in this &s;ad condition, by God's ble&s;|&s;ing he recovered, unexpectedly, at the re|turn of the &s;pring, on drinking goats milk warm every morning, after I had admini|&s;tered gentle, opening, &s;aline-ab&s;ter&s;ive and
<PB N="22" REF="31">nitrous powders, to remove his ob&s;tructions, and hectic heat.</P>
<P>YET we mu&s;t take notice, that tho' this be &s;uch a &s;overeign remedy for con&s;ump|tions, and when given in a judicious manner, &s;carce ever fails of &s;ucce&s;s, yet it will not cure every &s;ort of con&s;umption; but mu&s;t be applied in the beginning of the di&s;temper, and is mo&s;t likely to take effect, before the ulcers be grown callous, or the corroded ca|vity be too deep and large, or the fever be|come continued and without intermi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ju&s;tly advi&s;es, <Q>"If it be a real con|&s;umption, you ought to attack it as early as po&s;&s;ible; for when this di&s;temper is of long date, it is not ea&s;ily conquered. But in the beginning, as in all la&s;ting and ob|&s;tinate fevers, the u&s;e of milk is proper."</Q> And <HI>Alpinus</HI> very di&s;creetly &s;ays, that a re|gular cour&s;e of milk will cure con&s;umptions in their beginning, before the ulcers be grown large and callous.</P>
<P>As a &s;pitting of blood, difficulty of breath|ing, wa&s;ting of the fle&s;h, and a &s;mall fever,
<PB N="23" REF="32">all generally in&s;eparable companions of a con&s;umption of the lungs, are occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame cau&s;e, namely, an ob&s;truction of the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, and pu&s;tules that ari&s;e from thence, which in the height of the di|&s;temper grow to a &s;cirrhous and cancerous ulceration, there is no more powerful help again&s;t all the&s;e &s;ymptoms, than A&s;&s;es milk, and it has always been recommended by the mo&s;t antient and able phy&s;icians. There is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Trallian,</HI> which &s;ays, <Q>"If the whole body receives no be|nefit from food, but begins apparently to wa&s;te away, and the brea&s;t does not di&s;|charge much matter, they ought to live on milk only, and that of A&s;&s;es excells all others, becau&s;e it purges to a pro|per degree."</Q> The &s;ame author again commends A&s;&s;es milk for a difficulty of breathing: <Q>"Such as are afflicted with a difficulty of breathing, I have often known relieved by A&s;&s;es milk, when given properly, for it clears and removes whatever is fixed in the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs."</Q> And in another place, &s;peaking of &s;pitting blood, he fays, <Q>"All that &s;pit blood find relief from milk. For there
<PB N="24" REF="33">is no medicine or food of any kind &s;o &s;uited to their ca&s;e as milk: and tho&s;e that took to the u&s;e of that alone at fir&s;t, and per&s;evered in it for a long time, have all recovered their health. I knew a man that by living on milk for a whole year, and entirely ab&s;taining from wine, was cured of a &s;pitting of blood and matter, and e&s;caped falling into a con|&s;umption."</Q></P>
<P>A con&s;umption with a &s;low feveri&s;h heat, is mo&s;t times cau&s;ed by a &s;toppage or ob|&s;truction in the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, thence pro|ceeds a &s;tagnation of the humours, either in the lungs or bowels, and glandulous parts of the belly. Now A&s;&s;es milk &s;erves to moi&s;ten and remove the&s;e ob&s;tructions; it likewi&s;e cools and checks the violence of the feveri&s;h heat. Whence 'tis evident, that a right u&s;e of A&s;&s;es milk is not only extremely &s;ervice|able, but the very be&s;t of all remedies in a &s;low fever. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> agrees with us in this, and advi&s;es tho&s;e that have a con&s;ump|tion and &s;mall fever to drink milk. And <HI>Riverius</HI> relates a remarkable ca&s;e of a young lady of <HI>Montpellier,</HI> aged 25, who had been
<PB N="25" REF="34">long confined to her bed with a cough that harra&s;&s;ed her night and day, perpetual watch|ing, a pain in her &s;tomach, a &s;low fever, co&s;tivene&s;s, and a general decay of the whole body, who was perfectly recovered by drink|ing A&s;&s;es milk for one month, after being prepared for it by a laxative cooling julep.</P>
<P>To this let me add a mo&s;t &s;ingular ca&s;e that came within my ob&s;ervation a few years ago. A gentlewoman had for many years been &s;ubject to much &s;ickne&s;s, but now for half a year together was afflicted with a &s;low fever, a loathing of food, languidne&s;s of the limbs, a dry cough, watchings, a great pain about the Os Sacrum, heat of urine, pro|fu&s;e &s;weats by night, and &s;o entire a wa&s;te and decay in fle&s;h and &s;trength, that &s;he was unable to &s;tir from her bed. In vain had &s;he been ply'd with decoctions, an|ti-hectic powders, &s;tomachicks, anti-hy&s;te|rics, re&s;olvents, and a thou&s;and other things; &s;he lay pa&s;t all hopes, and in ex|pectation of certain death. At length, in the beginning of the &s;pring, by my direc|tions, &s;he took to A&s;&s;es milk, taking be|tween whiles a little opening manna, mixed
<PB N="26" REF="35">with &s;ome cooling nitrous powders, and now and then &s;ome nouri&s;hing broths pre|pared with laxative roots, and with &s;uch happy &s;ucce&s;s, that in three days only, every thing appeared wonderfully amended; and tho' the cure was not entirely compleated in many weeks, &s;he was at la&s;t perfectly re|&s;tored to her health and vigour.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e judge A&s;&s;es milk to be very efficacious again&s;t an Empyema, which is often cau&s;ed by a pleure&s;y improperly treat|ed, e&s;pecially in bodies of a &s;pongy habit, and &s;hews it&s;elf by a con&s;tant and copious &s;pitting of matter. To confirm which opi|nion I &s;hall relate a remarkable ca&s;e as told by <HI>T. Valleriola:</HI> A woman, after recovery from a pleure&s;y, began to di&s;charge, by &s;pitting, great quantities of purulent matter, which reduc'd her to a mi&s;erable, thin, emaciated, and lifele&s;s condition. The au|thor tried to relieve her brea&s;t of that load of filth by deter&s;ive drinks, linctus's, broths, and &s;uch &s;ort of things, but without &s;ucce&s;s: at length, as her fever was not very high, nor any ob&s;truction appeared to be in the Hypochondria, or the bowels, he pre&s;cribed
<PB N="27" REF="36">A&s;&s;es milk fre&s;h milked, and &s;weetened with a little &s;ugar, which having drank for &s;ix weeks, &s;he recovered her health and a good con&s;titution, and died twelve years after in child-bed. I likewi&s;e remember, many years &s;ince, when I practis'd phy&s;ic at <HI>Minden,</HI> a nobleman, thirty years of age, of a full and &s;anguine habit of body, who, af|ter a pleure&s;y injudiciou&s;ly treated, fell into &s;o very great a &s;pitting both of purulent and chylous matter, which la&s;ted more than a month; and that he &s;ometimes &s;pit more than a pint a day, and was thereby &s;urprizing|ly weaken'd and emaciated. I ordered him to drink A&s;&s;es milk, with powders of crab-&s;hells and bole armonic, bal&s;am of &s;ulphur of almonds, &s;perma ceti, and dragons blood mixt; when he had done this for two months, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of providence he was happily cured, to the admiration of all that knew him.</P>
<P>BUT yet, 'tis not only in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which affect the lungs and other inte&s;tines with a cough, fever, wa&s;te and con&s;ump|tion, that A&s;&s;es milk has this admirable and divine efficacy, but it is al&s;o wonderfully
<PB N="28" REF="37">&s;erviceable for &s;oothing, abating, and lulling the fiercene&s;s of pains in the nervous parts of the body, chiefly tho&s;e that fix them&s;elves in the joints. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as the gout in the hands, feet, and hips, are cau&s;ed by a &s;harp, thin &s;erum, i&s;&s;uing out of tho&s;e glands which were di&s;covered by <HI>Clopton Havers,</HI> nay through the coats of the glands, and falling on the articulo-nerveo-tendinous ligaments, which corrodes them and occa|&s;ions mo&s;t acute pains, cramps, and con|tractions of the limbs. This, in time, af|fects the whole &s;y&s;tem of the nerves, and brings on a fever, watching, anxiety, lan|guidne&s;s, want of appetite, and univer&s;al re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, if the fit be very violent. In the&s;e rheumatic and gouty ca&s;es, the whole ma&s;s of humours is infected with foul, &s;alt, tartarous, and &s;harp particles; which is perhaps owing to &s;ome antecedent cau&s;e, a fullne&s;s of blood, &s;ome &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a cri|tical di&s;charge from the blood, irregular living, or exce&s;s in eating; and yet &s;ome modern practitioners are apt to confound the&s;e remote cau&s;es with the proximate, the &s;alt foulne&s;s of the humours, and prove them|&s;elves quite ignorant of the nature of this
<PB N="29" REF="38">di&s;temper, as well as of the method of ap|plying remedies. For it's evident from ex|perience, that all &s;uch remedies as &s;weeten the juices, correct the &s;harp &s;alts, and as it were &s;heath-up their points, and at the &s;ame, time gently promote each different kind of excretion, go a great way towards relieving the violence of the di&s;temper, &s;often and mi|tigate the &s;harp pains, and in a great mea|&s;ure cure the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, unle&s;s it be he|reditary, or of a very long date.</P>
<P>Now milk, and particularly that of A&s;&s;es, is by far the be&s;t and mo&s;t excellent of this &s;ort of remedies, excepting the diluting de|coctions that are prepared from roots. Nor is its excellence any late di&s;covery of the moderns, but the earlie&s;t writers in phy&s;ic, and all their followers, highly recommended and approve it. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> advi&s;es, in a &s;ciatica, fir&s;t a purge, and then a cour&s;e of A&s;&s;es milk. And in the &s;ame treati&s;e, he adds, it is proper in the gout fir&s;t to &s;often the bowels with a gly&s;ter or &s;uppo&s;itory, and after a purge to drink warm whey or A&s;&s;es milk. <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us many have been relieved from pains in the joints by drinking milk.
<PB N="30" REF="39">And <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> &s;ays, many people, by a long cour&s;e of A&s;&s;es milk, have been &s;o thoroughly cleared of this di&s;temper, as to be free from it ever after. Among the moderns, <HI>Gabriel Fon&s;eca, Hollerius, Ballonius, Baglivi, Sydenham, Sachs, Gri&s;elius, Pechlinus, Dolaeus, Wald&s;ch|midt,</HI> and many more, all agree, from num|berle&s;s experiments and ob&s;ervations, in al|lowing milk, and e&s;pecially A&s;&s;es milk, to be the principal comfort and relief of gouty and rheumatic per&s;ons.</P>
<P>AND I can from my own knowledge a&s;&s;ert, that after u&s;ing gentle laxatives made of manna, &s;olutive &s;yrup of ro&s;es, and &s;ome ab|&s;orbents mixed, I have found the drinking of goats milk, (where A&s;&s;es could not be had) for many days together, without meat or drink of any other &s;ort, has given great be|nefit; the pains have grown milder, and of &s;horter continuance, and all the other &s;ymp|toms have cea&s;ed. I have known many gouty old men, who after drinking A&s;&s;es milk with manna for the three fir&s;t days, and then con|tinuing it alone for a fortnight, have found their pains greatly abated: but when they laid a&s;ide this remedy, their torture was mo&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="40">inten&s;e and ob&s;tinate, and confined them to their beds for &s;ome months. Yet this mu&s;t all along be ob&s;erved, that in the&s;e di&s;tem|pers the good effects of milk is more &s;peedy and certain where the patient is young, the di&s;ea&s;e not inveterate, the gout not fixed to a particular part, nor tran&s;mitted by inhe|ritance.</P>
<P>As A&s;&s;es milk proves &s;o very u&s;eful in re|lieving the pains that &s;eize the outward parts of the Body, &s;o it is likewi&s;e no le&s;s &s;ervice|able again&s;t tho&s;e that affect the inward nervous parts, the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, as is the ca&s;e in convul&s;ive cholics. This very beneficial effect of it is to be accounted for in the following manner: The A&s;&s;es milk, being diluting, corrects and overpowers the acrimony of the bilious juices, &s;oftens and relaxes the contracted fibres with its &s;erous and &s;lippery particles, and with its &s;weet in|gredients renders the bowels laxative; then that corro&s;ive matter which occa&s;ions all the pain, is readily conveyed off by &s;tool, and all is ea&s;y and quiet. The truth of this <HI>Ballonius</HI> a&s;&s;erts, and although <HI>Hippocrates</HI> forbids the u&s;e of milk where there are bilious purgings,
<PB N="32" REF="41">yet, if there be no remarkable fever to cor|rupt the milk, I think it &s;hould be given. For if it may be thrown into the bowels by a gly&s;ter, without any hurtful effect, why not al&s;o into the &s;tomach?</P>
<P>WHEN cramps and convul&s;ions &s;eize the nervous parts, which is the common &s;ymp|tom in hypochondriac and hy&s;teric fits, I have always ob&s;erved milk, e&s;pecially that of A&s;&s;es, do great good; provided there be no co&s;tivene&s;s, nor ob&s;truction in the bowels, and the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages be not clogged with &s;harp and vi&s;cid phlegm. Hence <HI>Sydenham</HI> highly approves the u&s;e of milk in what he calls the hy&s;teric cholic. <Q>Many women, &s;ays he, for a long while troubled with hy&s;teric di&s;orders, e&s;pecially that which I call hy&s;teric cholic, have been quite cured by only living on milk for &s;ome time."</Q><HI>Bened. Sylvaticus</HI> be&s;tows the highe&s;t prai&s;es on A&s;&s;es milk in hypochondriac complaints, which he directs to be &s;weetned with &s;ugar, and made a moderate purge by a &s;mall mix|ture of powdered &s;enna, and drank for forty days together. And although <HI>Hippocrates</HI> for|bids milk where the hypochondria are di|&s;tended,
<PB N="33" REF="42">that is, when the &s;tomach is ex|panded with wind, or the belly &s;woln and overcharged with blood, yet I have often learn'd from indi&s;putable experience, that the hypochondria are not always thus op|pre&s;&s;ed, but that the &s;tomach and adjoining inte&s;tines are often tortured with contractions cau&s;ed by the &s;harpne&s;s of the humours, and blood that &s;tagnates in the finer ve&s;&s;els, and that this di&s;order is &s;ucce&s;sfully removed by milk.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on this judicious au|thor zealou&s;ly recommends A&s;&s;es milk, in madne&s;s and hypochondriac melancholy, which are occa&s;ioned by &s;pa&s;ms, that force too great a quantity of blood into the head, &s;o that it cannot circulate equally and freely thro' the ve&s;&s;els of the membranes that in|clo&s;e the brain: and if it be drank every morning to the quantity of four or five ounces, for the &s;pace of a month, or longer, it corrects the acrid humours, ea&s;es the con|tractions of the fibres, cools and relaxes the bowels, and by gradually removing the cau&s;e, &s;ubdues that terrible di&s;order. But in order
<PB N="34" REF="43">for more certain &s;ucce&s;s, it is proper to make an addition to the purging quality of the milk, by mixing a little manna; the happy effects of which I have very often expe|rienced.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore it is &s;o evident that A&s;&s;es milk is beneficial to the nerves, and heals their &s;everal fore-mentioned di&s;orders by means of its &s;oftening and lubricating quality, we can|not doubt but it may be properly admi|ni&s;tered in other complaints, where the ner|vous parts are likewi&s;e afflicted and di&s;or|dered with violent motions, as in epilep&s;ies and convul&s;ive fits. This is affirmed by that eminent author <HI>Sylvaticus,</HI> in many places; and I can atte&s;t the &s;ame with con|fidence. For I could produce very many examples of it, but one in particular of a youth of noble birth, about fourteen years of age, and of admirable parts and under|&s;tanding. Having been &s;truck by &s;ome &s;udden fright, he was in&s;tantly &s;eized with &s;trong convul&s;ions in his limbs, chiefly his legs and arms: and after much anxiety and un|ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;pirits, was oppre&s;&s;ed with entire
<PB N="35" REF="44">&s;woonings, &s;o that the fit came &s;ometimes every other day, &s;ometimes every day, about the evening, and pur&s;uing him for the &s;pace of two months, reduced him to a very weak condition. Many phy&s;icians were con&s;ulted, who gave him various medicines, but with|out any effect: at la&s;t he was ordered to drink every morning about three ounces of A&s;&s;es milk, now and then with a little manna, and to be put in a warm bath every other day, taking between whiles &s;ome anti-epileptic powders: in a month's time the di&s;order di&s;appeared, and the patient, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, recovered his health and &s;trength.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider tho&s;e grievous di&s;orders that attend the &s;curvy, &s;uch as a wa&s;ting of the fle&s;h, fierce pains and contractions of the limbs, external ulcers and ero&s;ions. All which are derived from a total di&s;temperature of the juices, a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e very u&s;eful evacuations of &s;weat and excrement; from a a defect in the &s;ecretion of the bilious hu|mours in the &s;pleen; from a &s;alt &s;ulphureous foulne&s;s in the humours; and likewi&s;e from
<PB N="36" REF="45">their too thick con&s;i&s;tence, which retards their natural progre&s;s, and ob&s;tructs the finer ve&s;&s;els. Now nothing can be &s;o proper to open the&s;e clo&s;ed pa&s;&s;ages, to remove ob&s;truc|tions, to correct the acrimony of the hu|mours and to di&s;&s;olve their vi&s;cidity, as di|luting, moi&s;tening and cooling remedies, &s;uch as the whey of goats milk, or, what is &s;till preferable to all, A&s;&s;es milk.</P>
<P>THE &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony I can produce in favour of this eminent good quality in milk, is that of the be&s;t author that ever wrote upon the &s;curvy, <HI>Eugalenus,</HI> who &s;ays, <Q>"I have &s;een many people recover out of the &s;curvy from the u&s;e of milk and milk-diets, with a &s;tronger and better con&s;titution than tho&s;e that have lived under the rules and pre&s;criptions of phy&s;icians."</Q> And he men|tions &s;everal that have been cured of &s;corbu|tic fevers by milk, though contrary to the pre|&s;cription of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> in his aphori&s;ms. And I my&s;elf could produce a multitude of ex|amples within my own experience of people afflicted with a wandering &s;corbutic gout, (a national di&s;temper in <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI>) whom I
<PB N="37" REF="46">ab&s;olutely cured, when I practi&s;ed phy&s;ic at <HI>Minda,</HI> with no other medicine than A&s;&s;es, or other &s;orts of milk, if it were not need|le&s;s to tire the reader with &s;o many illu|&s;trations of a thing that is &s;o clear and evi|dent.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;corbutic people and old men, who are naturally &s;ubject to a &s;alt and foul corruption of the humours, and likewi&s;e &s;uch as are infected with a venereal taint, are afflicted with dangerous ulcers that &s;eem to re&s;emble cancers; even in the&s;e terrible &s;ymptoms a very &s;peedy and &s;ure relief may be had from A&s;&s;es milk, and the whey of it. Which, as it is evident from all the above-mentioned arguments, is likewi&s;e con|firmed by the authorities of many authors both antient and modern. <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> recom|mends milk, mixed with honey, or &s;alt, in all &s;orts of ulcerations in general, as well in|ward as outward, for violent itching in the &s;kin, pimples, and foul humours of the body. <HI>Galen</HI> advi&s;es the u&s;e of A&s;&s;es milk for ulcers in the uterus, the reins, the blad|der, and pudenda. To the&s;e we may add
<PB N="38" REF="47">the a&s;&s;ertion of <HI>Sylvaticus,</HI> that A&s;&s;es milk drank for thirty or forty days together, not only entirely cured a cancerous &s;welling in the neck of the uterus, but al&s;o a venereal ulcer, attended with a con&s;umption and &s;low fever. Again, the &s;ame author commends the &s;ame remedy for the cure of that hercu|lean di&s;temper, the elephantia&s;is, in the&s;e words; <Q>"A&s;&s;es milk drank every morning to the quantity of a quart, with a little &s;ugar, and cream of tartar, to render it purgative, is a very excellent remedy for the elephantia&s;is."</Q> And <HI>Ambro&s;e Parey,</HI> in his book of &s;urgery, &s;ays, he has known by experience the admirable efficacy of A&s;&s;es milk, in cancerous ulcers, both taken inwardly, and applied outwardly in fomentations.</P>
<P>AND while we are enumerating the many noble virtues of A&s;&s;es milk, we mu&s;t not omit its peculiar excellence not only as a remedy to the di&s;tempers of old men, but as a &s;ort of food of great efficacy in re&s;toring their decayed &s;trength. With regard to its medicinal excellence in relieving old age, we
<PB N="39" REF="48">have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn at large, that in an advanced age, the blood and all the juices contract a great degree of foulne&s;s and cor|ruption, from ob&s;tructions in the excretory glands and ve&s;&s;els, whence in time proceeds variety of di&s;tempers, the mo&s;t remarkable of which are indige&s;tion, languidne&s;s in the limbs, con&s;umption of the &s;olids, a low fever, and <HI>pruritus.</HI> And all the&s;e are to be relieved by a proper u&s;e of milk. And on this account it has always been held in great e&s;teem both by the ancients and moderns; for it is very efficacious in rendering the hu|mours fluid when they are too thick, in di|luting tho&s;e that are &s;alt and acrid, in relax|ing the too rigid and ten&s;e fibres, and in re&s;toring the excretions, when di&s;turbed, to their proper order, as it not only clean&s;es the foul juices, but likewi&s;e breeds a proper &s;up|ply of good ones. It will be &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to produce the authority of <HI>Trallian,</HI> who &s;trongly recommends A&s;&s;es milk to old people who are under a con|&s;umptive wa&s;ting; and the rea&s;on he gives for it is, becau&s;e they have but a &s;mall &s;hare of &s;trength, and are neither able to &s;eparate
<PB N="40" REF="49">nouri&s;hment from common food, nor to di|&s;tribute it thro' the con&s;titution; wherefore the milk of women is fir&s;t to be prefer'd, and next to it that of A&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IF we enquire into the nouri&s;hing and ana|leptic property of A&s;&s;es milk, by which it retards the decays of old age, and re&s;tores the &s;trength of tho&s;e who have been re|duced by di&s;tempers, no body can he&s;itate to give the preference to this kind of milk above any others.</P>
<P>BUT it may not perhaps be di&s;agreeable, or improper, to produce the authority of authors of great credit, who have treated of this &s;ubject. I &s;hall begin with the recom|mendation that <HI>Helmont</HI> gives of it; who, al|tho' in other parts of his writings he con|demns the u&s;e of milk, yet <HI>in Libr. de Di|ge&s;t. Aliment.</HI> a&s;cribes a particularly refre&s;h|ing invigorating and nouri&s;hing property to that of A&s;&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ing that the A&s;s, as a long-liv'd animal, is furni&s;h'd with milk preferable to any others. <HI>Eryphon,</HI> as <HI>Hero|dotus</HI> relates, relied altogether on A&s;&s;es milk
<PB N="41" REF="50">for re&s;toring old and emaciated people. I my&s;elf al&s;o knew an officer of the army, who was re&s;tored to his former health and ea&s;e by A&s;&s;es milk, tho' he was almo&s;t en|tirely wa&s;ted away with the venereal di|&s;temper and excruciating pains that had af|flicted him for &s;everal years. <HI>Heurnius</HI> al&s;o relates, that A&s;&s;es milk prevents old age and wrinkles; for which rea&s;on, no doubt, it was that <HI>Poppaea,</HI> the wife of <HI>Nero,</HI> always ordered a hundred A&s;&s;es to be kept, that &s;he might bathe every day in their milk, to pre&s;erve her &s;kin white, &s;oft, and &s;mooth.</P>
<P>HAVING now explained the property of A&s;&s;es milk, and its excellence in &s;everal di&s;|orders, I &s;hall proceed to the proper method of giving it, and then &s;hew what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in order to expect &s;ucce&s;s from it. But it will fir&s;t be proper to &s;ay &s;omewhat of the animal it&s;elf. A milch A&s;s ought to be quite free from any di&s;order, not very old, but of a middle age, neither too fat nor too lean, and may be e&s;teemed the better if &s;he bring her foal in the month of <HI>May.</HI> She ought not to be
<PB N="42" REF="51">fed in a hou&s;e, but kept in meadows which produce plenty of medicinal herbs; &s;he &s;hould drink river water, which, as it is lighter and more diluting than &s;pring water, pa&s;&s;es off quicker by the proper di&s;charges, and mixing more thoroughly with the hu|mours, clean&s;es them more effectually. <HI>Hel|mont</HI> has an ingenious remark on this &s;ubject: he advi&s;es that the A&s;s &s;hould be combed or curried every morning as hor&s;es are, for that it may ea&s;ily be known from the milk, whether &s;he has been dre&s;&s;ed that morning or not. Without doubt there may be &s;ome rea&s;on for this, becau&s;e the u&s;e of the curry|comb increa&s;es per&s;piration, and clean&s;es the humours, by pa&s;&s;ing off a great many &s;aline particles that way.</P>
<P>IT ought to be con&s;ider'd too what the A&s;s is fed with, becau&s;e the nature and pro|perties of the milk of animals is alter'd by their diet, &s;o as to be more or le&s;s whole|&s;ome, or even adapted to &s;ome particular di&s;orders. For as it is a common practice to make a purging or alterative medicine given to the nur&s;e, communicate its proper|perties
<PB N="43" REF="52">to her milk and take effect on the child, &s;o no doubt the &s;ame will hold good in regard to the animals who&s;e milk we u&s;e. <HI>Galen</HI> proves this by the in&s;tance of goats, who are fed with &s;cammony or &s;purge, who&s;e milk is purging. <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> and <HI>Hippocrates</HI> are of the &s;ame opinion, and in the <HI>Acta Haffnien&s;ia</HI> it is a&s;&s;erted, that worm|wood eaten in large quantities makes the milk bitter. From hence it is that <HI>Coelius Aurelianus</HI> commends milk in the coeliac pa&s;&s;ion, or flux, which is taken from goats that feed on willows, vine leaves, oaks, or &s;allows, plaintain, and plants of the &s;ame nature; giving this rea&s;on for it, <Q>"becau&s;e the a&s;tringent quality of the herbs com|municates it&s;elf to the milk."</Q> But there is a remarkable difference between the milk which is produced in &s;pring from green pa|&s;ture, and that in winter from dry food. <HI>Varro,</HI> who was very well acquainted with what belong to country affairs, was of this opinion, and &s;ays, <Q>"that milk from barley and &s;tubble, and all kinds of hard and dry food is nouri&s;hing; but that is more clean&s;|ing which comes from green pa&s;ture."</Q> And
<PB N="44" REF="53"><HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> thinks that milk in &s;pring is thinner, and becau&s;e it comes from green pa&s;ture, more laxative and &s;oftening.</P>
<P>FROM whence it plainly appears, that milk of all &s;orts, but more e&s;pecially A&s;&s;es, is not only mo&s;t &s;erviceable in the &s;pring, but that its virtues may, by a regulation of food, be &s;o prepared, as to be particularly effective again&s;t any one di&s;temper. Where|fore I &s;hould advi&s;e that a milch A&s;s be fed with &s;uch herbs as in them&s;elves are known proper for the di&s;ea&s;e you would relieve. In a con&s;umption, and di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs and brea&s;t, let her be &s;upplied with vero|nica, ground ivy, the blind or dead nettle, colts-foot, &s;curvy-gra&s;s; or, if you want to re&s;tore the vigour of the &s;olids, with &s;anicula, tan&s;ey, nummularia, con&s;olida-major, flowers of St. John's-wort, alchi|milla, polygonum, and the like; or let the creature be drove to places where the&s;e plants abound. In pains and &s;pa&s;ms, both inward and external, it may be u&s;eful to mix in her food yarrow, chamomile flow|ers, acacia, mead-wort, tilia, melilot, &s;purge,
<PB N="45" REF="54">mallows, mar&s;h mallows, and others of this nature. In &s;low and hectic fevers, (be&s;ides tho&s;e we named as good for the lungs) we may add plantane, prunella, and &s;curvy-gra&s;s mix'd with germander. If the hypo|chondria are ob&s;tructed, and cau&s;e a &s;cor|butic foulne&s;s in the juices, choo&s;e out &s;ome herbs of the opening or laxative kind; &s;uch are fumitory, the le&s;&s;er centaury, ab&s;in|thium, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, trefoil, water-cre&s;s, na|&s;turtium, and the le&s;&s;er hou&s;e-leek. In the &s;ame manner may milk be rendered medi|cinal, and fit for almo&s;t any complaints, by admini&s;tring &s;uch herbs and flowers as the phy&s;ician &s;hall e&s;teem mo&s;t proper and ef|fectual.</P>
<P>As to the method of u&s;ing it, the&s;e fol|lowing rules may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, A&s;&s;es milk may be drank at all times; but it is by far the mo&s;t &s;erviceable in the &s;pring and &s;ummer, when all the herbs are full of juices, and greatly enrich the milk. 2. The milk &s;hould be milked into a pail &s;et over hot water, and
<PB N="46" REF="55">immediately put into a ve&s;&s;el that has a narrow mouth, and &s;huts clo&s;e, and &s;o drank di|rectly while it is warm; for milk, like all other liquors, has a &s;ubtle &s;pirit, of a &s;trengthening and invigorating quality, which by no means ought to be allowed to fly off with its warmth. Hence <HI>Galen</HI> orders that milk be drank in&s;tantly, and the animal brought to the patient's bed-&s;ide; for that its nature, like that of the &s;emen, is at once altered by the open air. 3. The morning is the be&s;t time of day to drink, as it will operate the ea&s;ier in an empty &s;tomach; and therefore no other food ought to be taken in four or five hours after it. Yet, if circum|&s;tances require a frequent repetition of it, if may be drank in the afternoon; but it &s;hould be about four hours after dinner has been dige&s;ted, and in but half the quantity that is drank in the morning, 4. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;cribe in general any fix'd quantity that &s;hould be u&s;ed, becau&s;e of the difference of ages, con&s;titutions, and di&s;tempers; but thus far may be &s;aid, that you ought never to exceed the quantity of three common pints. 5. The time of continuing it mu&s;t be di|rected
<PB N="47" REF="56">by the degree and &s;trength of the di&s;temper: if that be very ob&s;tinate, it were well to continue drinking it for three months, or longer; e&s;pecially if a favourable pro&s;pect appears of &s;ucce&s;s, and the violence of the &s;ymptoms abate very di&s;cernably.</P>
<P>YET a prudent and experienced phy&s;ician will &s;o order, regulate, and methodi&s;e the u&s;e of this medicine, as almo&s;t to in&s;ure &s;uc|ce&s;s, and avoid any hurtful con&s;equences. I &s;hall therefore conclude with a few cautions that &s;hould be ob&s;erved very accurately.</P>
<P N="1">1. BEFORE a cour&s;e of milk is begun, the &s;tate and condition of the &s;tomach mu&s;t be carefully inquired into: Whether it will bear milk, and have a &s;ufficient degree of &s;trength to concoct, dige&s;t, and then di&s;charge it. For if that be weak and infirm, if it be troubled with wind and phlegm, or be load|ed with a croud of acid humours, milk mu&s;t not be taken; becau&s;e, until the&s;e things are remedied, that will curdle and &s;tagnate, and corrupt, and increa&s;e the flatulence and unea&s;ine&s;s. It will be proper therefore to
<PB N="48" REF="57">clean&s;e and relieve the &s;tomach fir&s;t, either downwards, by a gentle do&s;e of manna, or, where the ca&s;e will allow, by a vomit with a grain or two of emetic tartar. 2. Great care mu&s;t be had that the milk be not turned to curd. And therefore where the food is apt to grow acid in the &s;tomach, as is the ca&s;e with old and hypochondriac people, it is advi&s;eable to give ab&s;orbent, earthy, and alcaline medicines, mix'd with the milk, adding likewi&s;e &s;ome &s;tomachic carminative e&s;&s;ence, or volatile oily &s;alt. 3. When the patient has drank milk for &s;ix or eight days, a gentle do&s;e of manna &s;hould be given, to purge the bowels, and carry off whatever foul|ne&s;s the &s;tomach may have contracted, that the farther efficacy of the milk be not retarded. 4. It is be&s;t to drink it at fir&s;t &s;paringly, three or four ounces, and then to increa&s;e the draught gradually, that the &s;tomach be not too &s;uddenly oppre&s;&s;ed, and conceive a di&s;like and loathing to the remedy. 5. A proper regulation of diet mu&s;t be ob&s;erved during the cour&s;e of milk. The lightne&s;s of food mu&s;t be chiefly con&s;ulted; avoid|ing not only meats hard of dige&s;tion, but
<PB N="49" REF="58">al&s;o tho&s;e that are reckoned to afford little nouri&s;hment, and likewi&s;e all flatulent vic|tuals, &s;ummer fruits, and acids of all kinds; ab&s;taining from all malt liquors, and wines, except a &s;mall quantity of the &s;ounde&s;t <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> wines. Nor &s;hould any bread be u&s;ed that is lumpi&s;h and fermented, but what is made of the cleane&s;t and fine&s;t wheat flour.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place let me add &s;ome in|&s;tances, wherein the u&s;e of milk may be judged improper. In head-aches ari&s;ing from crudities in the &s;tomach, in very acute fevers, and when the bowels are overcharged with gro&s;s blood, milk is very pernicious: being no le&s;s improper when the Stomach is cold and filled with acids, than when in a heat and ferment, as it is in fevers, and when the bilious humours abound, becau&s;e in both ca&s;es it quickly turns to a foul and offen&s;ive putrid &s;tate. Milk is al&s;o very prejudicial to tho&s;e who, either through neglect of bleeding, or a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the di&s;|charge of the piles, or the men&s;es, are afflict|ed with a too great and unnatural &s;hare of
<PB N="50" REF="59">blood, and con&s;equently with a foulne&s;s of the humours. Which agrees entirely with the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> That the more you nouri&s;h di&s;tempered bodies, the more you injure them. For unle&s;s the ex|ce&s;s of blood be reduced by moderate bleed|ing, and the faulty dige&s;tion amended by medicines that correct the whole ma&s;s of fluids, all &s;orts of milk mu&s;t be avoided, as extremely hurtful and dangerous.</P>
