<HEAD>TO Dr. <HI>MEAD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Art of Healing would &s;eem to be of all Arts the mo&s;t honourable, even tho' no better Rea&s;on could be given for it, than that it is the mo&s;t difficult. The la&s;t is indeed &s;o true, that the Task appears un&s;urmountable to many, and even to &s;ome of tho&s;e whom propitious Heaven has ble&s;s'd with the brighte&s;t and mo&s;t intelli|gent Faculties. The provident and
<PB N="iv" REF="4">all-wi&s;e Governor of the Univer&s;e, has therefore imprinted on &s;ome Minds a great and in&s;uperable Attachment to this Science, not to be overcome with Difficulties, or rather which knows no Difficulties; to whom the Study is as ea&s;ie as it is natural, and is &s;o far from being a Task, that it becomes a con|&s;iderable Part of their Happine&s;s; who can penetrate with Freedom and De|light all the latent Powers of created Bodies, and can di&s;cover by a Sagaci|ty &s;omewhat more than human, their Dependence and Effects on each other.</P>
<P>To this wonderful Bias, this hap|py Prejudice in Favour of <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> we owe the Characters of a <HI>Pitcairne, Li&s;ter, Friend, Sloane, Sydenham,</HI> &amp;c. But I &s;hall not be thought guilty of Flattery in &s;aying, that this Attach|ment
<PB N="v" REF="5">has in a very extraordinay Man|ner di&s;tingui&s;h'd Dr. <HI>Mead.</HI></P>
<P>I am no Stranger to Addre&s;&s;es of this Kind, or to the general Abu&s;e of them, than which nothing is more oppo&s;ite to my Temper and Inclinati|on; but a generous Mind, however upright, &s;incere and impartial, cannot avoid acknowledging, on the&s;e publick Occa&s;ions, the Merit which it admires and extolls in private Conver&s;ation; &s;uch a Mind I &s;ay, cannot forbear to confe&s;s in Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> deep Learning, profound Knowledge of Medicine, Candour, Be|nevolence, and Conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Qualities have pre|&s;erv'd thee from being mov'd with Applau&s;e or Adulation, and have hin|der'd Envy it&s;elf from attacking thee:
<PB N="vi" REF="6">They have both gain'd and pre&s;erv'd the E&s;teem as well of the Multitude, as of the learned World, thro' a very long Series of &s;ucce&s;sful Practice.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e Con&s;iderations have induced me to pre&s;ent thee with the following Sheets, which contain naked Truths, undi&s;guis'd with &s;ubtil and hypothetical Conjectures, but e&s;tabli&s;h'd on plain and certain Principles, con|&s;onant to the unparallel'd Sy&s;tem of <HI>Boerhaave.</HI></P>
<P>That thou maye&s;t long, very long, be pre&s;erv'd by thy own Art, to be an Example of Moderation, an Honour to the Profe&s;&s;ion, and a Pa|tron of it's ri&s;ing Sons, is the mo&s;t &s;incere Wi&s;h and Hope of</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT will be unnece&s;&s;ary to tell the Learned of the Facul|ty, that nothing has yet been wrote upon this Sub|ject, which might be &s;uffi|cient for the Information of tho&s;e who are unacquainted with it. The Sy&s;tematic Writers have either forgot it entirely, as <HI>Boer|haave</HI> has done, or have pa&s;s'd it over &s;uperficially, and as often ob|&s;curely. To the young Arti&s;t, therefore, I pre&s;ume this Piece will be acceptable; in which, tho' all has not been &s;aid which might be &s;aid, yet perhaps &s;uf|ficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to form a more clear and perfect Idea of this Di&s;ea&s;e and its Method of Cure, than has hitherto been
<PB N="viii" REF="8">offer'd to the Publick. The Method of Cure he will find more ample than the other Parts of this Di&s;cour&s;e, which are as conci&s;e as they could well be; but this will be readily excus'd, when he knows how much more difficult it is to cure this Malady, than to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould do Inju&s;tice to the Subject, if I forgot to take Notice, in this Place, of that very &s;hort and &s;ubtile Method, by which the gro&s;s Super&s;tition of our An|ce&s;tors taught them to believe this very ob&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;e might be cur'd, <HI>viz.</HI> By the wonder-working Touch of a &s;cepter'd Hand, or of a Piece of Money from the &s;ame Hand; but we are to re|mark, by the bye, that it mu&s;t be the Hand of a lineal Heir to the Crown; for tho&s;e intitled to it, by the Invitation of the Subject, or the Voice of the People, (tho' this was the be&s;t Title in the World) were not thought capable of performing this Feat, till this Royalty had been propagated to the &s;econd or third Generation. And this was &s;o much attended to, that they &s;crupled not to make a Miracle the Te&s;t of his Prerogative or genuine De&s;cent; as
<PB N="ix" REF="9">may be gathered from the Records of Antiquity. Tho' the Light of a bet|ter govern'd Eaucation has &s;hewn the Weakne&s;s and blind Credulity of our Forefathers, and made us Infidels to the&s;e and the like Traditions; yet we &s;hall find that many of them &s;till re|main in E&s;teem, and even with tho&s;e who want neither the Advantages of Learning, or of natural Sagacity; and with the Multitude mo&s;t of them re|main un&s;haken. Of the&s;e Traditions the Royal Touch for the Evil is none of the lea&s;t &s;acred: The Origin of this Whim &s;eems to be at lea&s;t as old as the dark Night of Popery in this I&s;land; having probably been contrived to an&s;wer the De&s;igns of the crafty Prie&s;ts upon a &s;uper&s;titious People, &s;ince by &s;uch a Mi|racle as this they might claim a Right to the Throne for that Prince who would be&s;t an&s;wer their Purpo&s;es; and &s;uch Miracles they would not fail of publi&s;h|ing by Whole&s;ale, tho' upon no better Foundation than their own dark Inven|tions. This Conjecture will appear more probable to tho&s;e who know, that from &s;uch vile Arts as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the forging of Miracles, the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Reli|gion
<PB N="x" REF="10">receives no incon&s;iderable Support, even at this Day in Foreign Countries, tho' the Learned among&s;t them are not &s;o blind as not to &s;ee it; but a Hand of Cruelty commands at lea&s;t their Silence, and forbids them to &s;ay that they have Eyes to &s;ee.</P>
<P>From this Piece of Super&s;tition then the Di&s;ea&s;e has borrow'd its <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Name, at lea&s;t a Part of it; but how it came to be call'd by Way of Eminence the Evil, is to be the Subject of another Enquiry. It &s;eems in Reality to have been owing to its great Ob&s;tinacy, which made it e&s;teem'd de&s;perate if not incurable: We need not wonder, if we &s;uppo&s;e that they knew nothing of the true Genius of this, or any other Di&s;|ea&s;es a very few Centuries ago; when the State of Phy&s;ick in <HI>England,</HI> was as de&s;picable as we can po&s;&s;ibly conceive it to have been: Witne&s;s the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Gilbert, John Gadde&s;den,</HI> &amp;c. the Archiaters of tho&s;e Days, when the Lives of Princes were tru&s;ted in the Hanas of ignorant Mountebanks: But tho' th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y were not perhaps le&s;s ignorant than their Modern Brethren, they were
<PB N="xi" REF="11">however, content not with doing much Mi&s;chief or &s;preading De&s;truction around them as &s;ome of the&s;e have done; but with acting the Impo&s;tor well, and catching their Game, in which they di&s;|cover'd at lea&s;t as much Craft as our modern Quacks, and much more ingeni|ous Roguery. By this we &s;ee that Phy&s;ick is but new to our Clime, tho' in Ju&s;tice to our Countrymen, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd it &s;uits the Soil &s;o well, that 'tis likely to make as great a Figure in this I&s;land, as in the ancient Empire of Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>But they had another Rea&s;on for e&s;|teeming this Di&s;ea&s;e worthy the Appel|lation of a Plague or Evil, <HI>viz.</HI> it's being remarkably hereditary. This is indeed one of the wor&s;t Circu&s;tances that can attend any Di&s;ea&s;e, which in&s;tead of being a private Misfortune, proves a Calamity to Families, and becomes an unhappy Mark of Di&s;tinction, as it appears always externally, and offers it&s;elf to the Ob&s;ervation of every Spectator. This indeed will appear a hard and unequal Law to tho&s;e who have not con&s;ider'd that the Con&s;titutions of Parents pro|perly
<PB N="xii" REF="12">belong to their Children, as much as the Species it&s;elf; nor can it be otherwi&s;e without rever&s;ing and coun|ter-acting tho&s;e uniform and perfect Laws which all Matter, and the or|ganiz'd Bodies compos'd of it are oblig'd to obey. The&s;e Laws we may &s;uppo&s;e as ancient as the fir&s;t Formation of Matter, and the mighty <HI>Fiat</HI> which unfolded the great Scene of Nature: They &s;eem, I &s;ay, to be as old as the Cre|ation it&s;elf, nor can they be contradicted, varied or &s;u&s;pended, without violating that Order and mo&s;t exact Harmony, which we ob&s;erve in all Nature's Works, and which were in&s;eparable from the Perfection of her Author.</P>
<P>But does it not hence follow, that all Di&s;ea&s;es are, or mu&s;t be hereditary? No: And why? This is no ea&s;y Que&s;tion, except it be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es only are hereditary, which can be communicated to the original Stamina of an animal Body. If this An&s;wer be not &s;atisfactory, we mu&s;t be content to acknowledge our Ignorance, by appeal|ing to others, "<HI>Dicat qui novit.</HI> This then was e&s;teem'd both an incurable and
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">hereditary Di&s;ea&s;e, and thi&s; probably the Rea&s;on why it was cho&s;en as the mo&s;t proper <HI>Subject</HI> for a Miracle, as the Cure of the <HI>greate&s;t Evil</HI> was fitte&s;t to demon|&s;trate the <HI>be&s;t King.</HI></P>
<P>I have only now to acquaint my Rea|ders, that the following Doctrines are &s;upported by the Di&s;&s;ection of Bodies, and other Matters of Fact. For as tho&s;e Things which affect our Sen&s;es, are al|ways e&s;teem'd the &s;ure&s;t and most infal|lible Te&s;t of every Doctrine; &s;o a more than common Regard to tho&s;e i&s; nece&s;&s;ary in our Attempts for the Advancement of <HI>Medicine;</HI> which as it is only conver&s;ible with &s;en&s;ible Bodies, ought not to admit any Thing for Truth which has not the Te&s;timony of the Sen&s;e&s;. On this Con&s;idera|tion, wearied with the Jargon and Con|fu&s;ion, which the Flights of fertil but deceitful Imagination had introauc'd into the noble&s;t of all Sciences, Many of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t judiciou&s; of the Mo|derns are re&s;olved to allow no Rea&s;oning for Orthodox, which is not &s;upported on the Ba&s;is of Demon&s;tration. By this Means an Art, which has been accu&s;ed of Doubt and Uncertainty, is already
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">arrived at &s;uch Perfection, as may enable her devoted Sons to follow her Steps with perfect uninterupted Satisfaction, and the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience. A great and admirable Progre&s;s has been made in this Reformation, by the late incomparable <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> which will be a Subject of Prai&s;e and Admiration in Ages to come, and an Honour to the Age and Country in which he liv'd.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE KING'S-EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>_NOTHING is more nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect under&s;tanding any Di&s;ea&s;e, than a ju&s;t and exact Definition; &s;uch an one as may determine the Bounds betwixt the real Subject and every Thing that may be di&s;gui&s;ed under a &s;imilar Appearance. This, which we &s;hall call a deter|minate Definition, was never more requi&s;ite in any Di&s;ea&s;e, than that which is to be the Subject of this E&s;&s;ay; which, as it is ob&s;erv'd to be remarkably hereditary, is reputed (tho unju&s;tly) the mo&s;t igno|minious of Di&s;ea&s;es, if we except the <HI>Lues;</HI> and for this Rea&s;on we ought to be well inform'd of the Requi&s;ites for di&s;tingui&s;hing this <HI>Hydra</HI> from the
<PB N="2" REF="16">many Maladies which bear any the lea&s;t Re&s;emblance to it.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e then, we &s;hall call by the Name of <HI>Scrophula,</HI> or King's Evil, a Swelling which has the following Characters: <Q>'It is of the &s;ame Colour with the Skin, without Pain, and almo&s;t equal in Hardne&s;s to a <HI>Schirrus</HI>;'</Q> but the&s;e will not be &s;o well under&s;tood, without adding to them &s;uch a deprav'd State of the Fluids as di&s;po&s;es them to be <HI>pituitous.</HI> By De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ravity here, I mean no more than that original Di&s;po&s;ition of both Solids and Fluids, which the Ancients call'd &s;ignificantly enough <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Temperamentum,</HI> of which they had no le&s;s than eight different Cla&s;&s;es. Of the&s;e, few were more remarkable than the <HI>Tempera|mentum pituito&s;um.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Pituit,</HI> the Ancients under&s;tood too great a Solution of the Blood, in which its Particles have lo&s;t that Figure, Firmne&s;s and Solidity, from which it derives its red Colour, but at the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">me time co|here together too tenaciou&s;ly; and thus we ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt this and the <HI>Humid Cra&s;is,</HI> in which the Tenacity is not included.</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, that this Di&s;po&s;ition of the Blood will render it unfit for many of its Functions, and alone is &s;ufficient for the Production of the wor&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es. And if it be a&s;k'd, where the&s;e are mo&s;t likely to be produc'd, or what Organs are
<PB N="3" REF="17">mo&s;t likely to &s;uffer? The An&s;wer will be ea&s;y, tho&s;e Organs in which the Circulation is the mo&s;t difficult: And, pray, which are the&s;e? Every Body knows, the Glands. Their Structure &s;eems &s;o much to retard the Motion of the Fluids thro' their Ve&s;&s;els, and the propelling Force of the Heart and Arteries is &s;o much dimini&s;h'd, that 'tis the greate&s;t wonder the Circulation is not more frequently in|terrupted.</P>
<P>The&s;e, therefore, are the Parts of the Body mo&s;t liable to be ob&s;tructed, and this is our Ca&s;e at pre&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t but among&s;t the&s;e the Glands of the con|glob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">te Kind about the Face, Axillae, Neck, Groin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet the&s;e are not all the Glands that are ob|&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o be affected; tho&s;e of the Me&s;entery are al&s;o ob&s;tructed too, and perhaps the readie&s;t of any, and indeed 'tis no wonder to tho&s;e who con&s;ider the Structure, Situation, and the <HI>Vis Propellens</HI> of the&s;e Glands. This la&s;t Ob&s;truction is indeed the productive Cau&s;e of the wor&s;t Symptom of this Di&s;ea&s;e, as will appear afterwards when we come to treat of the Symptoms.</P>
<P>But tho' this Malady principally affects the glan|dular Sy&s;tem, and chiefly tho&s;e Glands which we have mentioned, &s;everal other Parts are &s;ometimes Sharers in the Calamity. This is in its la&s;t Stage, and does not happen till it has made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s; and then, indeed, the Tendons, the Arti|culations, and the Bones them&s;elves are likewi&s;e affected.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="18">
<P>We ought, next in order, to deliver the Symptoms of this Di&s;ea&s;e; but as the&s;e cannot be under&s;tood without a previous Knowledge of its genuine Cau&s;e, we &s;hall for the Sake of Per&s;picuity be oblig'd to po&s;tpone our Account of the &s;everal <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> till we have di&s;covered the Sour&s;e from whence they are derived; and it had been well that this Method had been followed by many of tho&s;e who have taken &s;ome Trouble to oblige the World with E&s;&s;ays on Di&s;ea&s;es, which, tho' otherwi&s;e meritorious enough, have, for want of Order, fail'd in their De&s;ign, and left the Subject involv'd in its former Ob&s;curity. 'Tis too well known to be di&s;&s;embled, that this has been the Ca&s;e with too many of our own Countrymen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The learned Dr. ASTRUC, &s;peaking of a certain</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Writer, &s;ays</HI> Ordine parum compo&s;ito di&s;&s;eritur, &s;altem ea Methodo quae Lucem afferat, quam in <HI>Anglorum</HI> Medicorum Operibus plerumque de&s;iderari dolemas.

<P>The proximate<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See Pag. 2, and 3.</NOTE> Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e appears to be nothing more, than a vi&s;cid pituitous State of the Fluids and too great Laxity of the Solids. By the&s;e we mu&s;t endeavour to explain all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> we have to explain; and where the&s;e prove in&s;uf|ficient, we mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit to the Imputation of Ignorance. This however is only to be under|&s;tood
<PB N="5" REF="19">of the recent or &s;imple <HI>Struma,</HI> without tho&s;e de&s;perate Symptoms to be ob&s;erved in its la&s;t Stage, and which are to be referred to their proper Place.</P>
<P>The remote Cau&s;es of this Di&s;ea&s;e are, whatever Accidents are capable of producing the afore&s;aid Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;uch as, fir&s;t, an hereditary <HI>Labes,</HI> which is perhaps the mo&s;t frequent Cau&s;e. Every Body knows this Di&s;ea&s;e to be hereditary, but few know how it comes to be &s;o; we may &s;olve this Problem as ea&s;ily as any other of the &s;ame Kind by &s;aying, That an inviolable Law is impo&s;ed upon every <HI>Genus</HI> of created Bodies, whether animated or not, which propagate their Species, by which its <HI>Foetus</HI> or <HI>Embryo</HI> not only agrees in every individual Or|gan with its Parent, but likewi&s;e partakes of its Perfections or Imperfections. Thus the &s;olid Fibre produces another of the &s;ame Sort, and a lax Fibre a lax one, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus far we may proceed &s;afely, and perhaps no farther; for in attempting a more minute Solution, we &s;hall, I believe, find our &s;elves at our utmo&s;t Limits, and on the Border of Ob&s;cu|rity: There &s;eem to be &s;ome Bounds placed to all Phy&s;ical Enquiries, beyond which we cannot go, except in Imagination, and &s;ometimes even that will fail us. I don't mean by this to undervalue the deep Philo&s;opher or his profound Enquiries into the <HI>Ab&s;condita Naturae:</HI> No, the deep Man be&s;t de|&s;erves the Title of Philo&s;opher, and will always receive the mo&s;t Delight, as well as Honour, for
<PB N="6" REF="20">the Reward of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s Labour: But let us endeavour to be contented with the Knowledge within our Reach, and to place the Bounds betwixt deep and unfathom|able, profound and unintelligible. By this means we &s;hall &s;ave our&s;elves &s;ome Trouble, and avoid not a few Mi&s;takes.&mdash;Thus much on hereditary Di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The next of the remote Cau&s;es mu&s;t be under&s;tood from the Con&s;ideration of that Time of Life in which it fir&s;t di&s;covers it&s;elf: This is in Childhood, when both Solids and Fluids always tend too much to that <HI>Cachexia</HI> which we have a&s;&s;ign'd as the proximate Cau&s;e of the <HI>Scrophula.</HI> The <HI>Faetus</HI> immediately after Conception is a meer Jelly, and &s;carce any Di&s;tinction can be made betwixt its &s;olid and fluid Parts. In a few Months the fir&s;t have acquir'd a &s;tronger Power of Cohae&s;ion, and the latter are more attenuated: At the Time of Birth this Change is yet more con&s;iderable, but the Ve&s;&s;els are yet very lax, and their contain'd Liquors are vi&s;cid and di&s;pos'd to be pituitous; nor are they brought to a proper <HI>Cra&s;is</HI> in le&s;s than about twenty Years. Nobody who con&s;iders this will wonder why Children are &s;o &s;ubject to this Di&s;ea&s;e, but the Di&s;po&s;ition is often aggravated by their W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y of living, and from the immoderate U&s;e of &s;weet Fruits, farinaceous or other glutinous Sub&s;tances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="21">
<P>We are now at L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">berty to ob&s;erve the &s;everal Phaenomena, and will fir&s;t begin with the Tumours them&s;elves which were already de&s;crib'd in attempting to define the Di&s;ea&s;e. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI></P>
<P>They are di&s;pers'd, or, which is the &s;ame Thing, affect many different Glands at the &s;ame Time, and this needs no Explanation. <HI>Secondly,</HI> They are very &s;mooth, and this will be be&s;t under&s;tood by con&s;idering the Structure of the Organs affected; as their Figure is globular they will be equally di&s;tended on every Side by the ob&s;tructing Matter in their Cavities, and thus their Surface will be even and &s;mooth, tho' not commonly &s;hining. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The&s;e Tumours are al&s;o &s;omewhat hard, tho' not &s;o hard as the <HI>Schirrhus;</HI> the vi&s;cid Matter being lodg'd in the <HI>Follicle</HI> and confin'd there, the finer Parts are carried off by the <HI>Ab&s;orbent</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, and the remain|ing Matter, becomes more vi&s;cid, then glutinous, and at length firm: This is no more than happens, in a le&s;&s;er Degree, in all the Cavities of the Body where their contain'd Liquors are permitted to remain for &s;ome Time; as the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales,</HI> Gall, Bladder, <HI>&amp;c. Fourthly,</HI> They are, even when ulcerated, without Pain; and this, perhaps, is not le&s;s remarkable than any of the other Peculiars to this Di&s;ea&s;e. It will not be wonder'd that the <HI>Conglobate</HI> Glands have not this unea&s;y Sen&s;ation before their being ulcerated; as the &s;ame is ob&s;erv'd in more Di&s;ea&s;es than this, and may be explain'd afterwards; but the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Parts, as well as
<PB N="8" REF="22">the more firm, &s;uch as <HI>Tendons, Ligaments, &amp;c.</HI> are de&s;troy'd by this <HI>Labes,</HI> without any Sen&s;e of Pain. This indeed is not ea&s;ily under&s;tood, except it be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the De&s;truction of the&s;e nerve us Parts is not owing to any acrid Matter which corrodes them; but to the Laxity of the Ve&s;&s;els in which the <HI>Ten&s;ion,</HI> or attractive Force, is &s;o &s;mall, as to allow their component Fibres to be divided without that Re&s;i&s;tance which is the immediate Cau&s;e of Pain.</P>
<P>The next Symptom is an Inflation of the Face and Neck. This is indeed a con&s;tant Attendant of the <HI>Struma,</HI> and perhaps one of the be&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Signs we are acquainted with. I remember to have heard a learned Phy&s;ician, a Per&s;on of great Ingenuity, &s;ay, that by means of his long Experi|ence and Practice, he could di&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gui&s;h a Patient affected with this Di&s;ea&s;e, by only looking him in the Face. This Inflation is greate&s;t in the inferior Part of the Cheeks; and is be&s;t under&s;tood, by con&s;idering that in this Habit of Body the Ve&s;&s;els are &s;uppo&s;ed too lax, which alone will be &s;ufficient for under&s;tanding the Cau&s;e of an Inflation; but why this is confin'd to the Face and Neck, or at lea&s;t is more remarkable in the&s;e than any other Parts is not &s;o ea&s;ily under&s;tood. Perhaps the Expo&s;ure of the&s;e Parts to the Action of Cold, by which the proximate Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e is aggravated in their Ve&s;&s;els: The Number of Glands about the&s;e Parts, in which the Motion of
<PB N="9" REF="23">the Blood is retarded or ob&s;tructed; and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> an hereditary Di&s;po&s;ition of the Parts them&s;elves, may be &s;ufficient for explaining this <HI>Phaenomenon.</HI> We don't ob&s;erve that the Complexion is &s;o much chang'd as might be expected; there is however a certain livid or blui&s;h Ca&s;t, which is better learned by Ob&s;ervation than De&s;cription: This is &s;eldom wanted, and in Children helps to compleat that particular A&s;pect of the Face, from which the Pre&s;ence of this Di&s;ea&s;e will rarely be mi&s;taken by tho&s;e who have made the Study familiar.</P>
<P>Another remarkable Symptom of the <HI>Scrophula,</HI> is a great or frequent Pain in the Belly, which is ea&s;ily under&s;tood from what was &s;aid before of the <HI>Me&s;enteric</HI> Glands, if the&s;e are rightly &s;uppos'd to be the Seat of this Pain; but indeed this Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Bowels &s;eems, not le&s;s probably, to be pro|duced by the vi&s;cid pituitous Matter lodg'd in the <HI>Rugae</HI> of the Inte&s;tines them&s;elves; and this will perhaps appear more rea&s;onable, if we remember that the &s;ame Sort of Ob&s;truction does not produce Pain in the other Glands, or even much more &s;en&s;ible Parts; and that we find nothing more ready to produce a Cholic than this <HI>Pituit</HI> in the Inte&s;tines, as may be ob&s;erv'd in the Di&s;ea&s;es of Children.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Symptom we &s;hall mention, and which is rarely ab&s;ent in this Di&s;ea&s;e, is a great Pro&s;tration of the natural Functions; tho&s;e, to wit, of Dige&s;tion and Nutrition. This Change, or
<PB N="10" REF="24">Proce&s;s, is twofold, and may be comprehended under the general Heads of <HI>Chylification</HI> and <HI>Sanguification;</HI> but both the&s;e will &s;uffer greatly in &s;uch a Stale of the Solids and Fluids as was before de&s;crib'd as the <HI>proxima Cau&s;a</HI> of this Malady. The fir&s;t Requi&s;ite to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Actions is Appetite, or Inclination for Food, which is here de&s;troy'd by the great Quantity of vi&s;cid <HI>Pituit</HI> in the Stomach and Inte&s;tines. Again, after they are receiv'd into the Stomach, the Action of this is &s;o weak, and the Juices nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;&s;olving the Food are &s;o much deprav'd, that this Part of Dige&s;tion cannot proceed as it ought; and the &s;ame Defect will be found in the Inte&s;tines. The fir&s;t Proce&s;s therefore either is not perform'd at all, or at lea&s;t very imperfectly, and this Deficiency cannot be repair'd afterwards, for this crude and vi&s;cid <HI>Chyle,</HI> when receiv'd into the Circulation in Order to undergo it's &s;econd Change by the Action of the Ve&s;&s;els; but this is already too weak for that Purpo&s;e, and thus the <HI>Pituit</HI> increa&s;es, and at length the vital Functions &s;uffer. The la&s;t Con&s;equence will be a Hectic Fever, not to be expected till near the End of the Tragedy.</P>
<P>All the&s;e <HI>Phaenomena</HI> are &s;ometimes accompanied with a Fever, Heat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Tumour then becomes painful, and at length ulcerated, and what we commonly call malign, pouring out a di&s;agreeable <HI>Sanies,</HI> generating remarkably fungous Fle&s;h, and yielding little or nothing to Remedies. The Fever
<PB N="11" REF="25">&s;eems not to be the genuine Effect of the Di&s;ea&s;e, except we &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome other Cau&s;e to have acceded, as &s;ome acrid, irritating <HI>Virus,</HI> latent in the Fluids; but as this is not pre&s;um'd to be a Part of the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, we mu&s;t be oblig'd to impute the Fever to a foreign Cau&s;e of this or &s;ome other Kind. I know a Fever to be the natural Product of this Malady in it's advanc'd State, but it is of the Hectic Kind, and generally the Forerunner of Death.</P>
<P>This Fever appears to be generally owing to the <HI>Chyle,</HI> which however crude and unprepar'd is re|ceiv'd into the Ve&s;&s;els, and being incapable of un|dergoing its proper Change there, produces a <HI>Febris Symptomatica.</HI> The Circulation being now increas'd the Fluids are propell'd with more than wonted <HI>Impetus</HI> into the Glands, their <HI>Follicles</HI> are bur&s;t, and pour out a di&s;agreeable <HI>Sanies.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of all the&s;e is ea&s;ily under&s;tood. The <HI>Sanies</HI> will be ab&s;orb'd in pretty large Quanti|ty into the Ma&s;s of Blood, which being now infect|ed contaminates the whole Circulation, and thus all Parts of the Body may be affected.</P>
<P>Many fre&s;h Ulcers now appear on the external Parts; the Tendons and Ligaments them&s;elves are eroded and exulcerated, likewi&s;e the Bones chiefly at their Extremities where their Texture is lea&s;t firm by the <HI>Laminae</HI> being more &s;eparated from e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch
<PB N="12" REF="26">other; at length the internal <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> &s;uffer in the common Calamity, as they mu&s;t inevitably receive into their Ve&s;&s;els the &s;ame morbific Fluids which corrode and convert them into a &s;imilar <HI>Sanies.</HI> This again is ab&s;orb'd into the common Ma&s;s, which now becomes yet more corrupted; hence a <HI>Phthi&s;is Multiplex,</HI> which is certain Death.</P>
<P>'Tis unnece&s;&s;ary, as well as un&s;uitable to the De&s;ign we laid down, to trace the various Symp|toms, Effects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of this <HI>Pthi&s;is</HI> before it termi|nates in Death; but it may be proper to take notice that it is incurable; nor will a Proof of this be requir'd, after reflecting on what has been already deliver'd.</P>
<P>But the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Scrophula</HI> does not always ob&s;erve the Order we have explain'd; it &s;ometimes makes a &s;horter Period by &s;welling the Thuroid Gland, which by compre&s;&s;ing the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria</HI> puts a &s;udden End to the Scene. In this ca&s;e, the nece&s;&s;ary Relief cannot be ea&s;ily given, and our principal Dependence mu&s;t be on &s;uch Medicines as can be immediately applied to the Part affected, which mu&s;t be in the Form of Vapour; but of this more hereafter.</P>
<P>Thus far we have traced the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Scrophula</HI> with its &s;everal Symptoms, without &s;up|po&s;ing any other Di&s;ea&s;e connected with it, but this too frequently happens, and then 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee
<PB N="13" REF="27">how difficult will be the Cure, and how dubious the Event.</P>
<P>The Di&s;ea&s;es we find &s;ometimes joined to this are &s;everal, and tho&s;e of the wor&s;t Kind too, which give a <HI>Stimulus</HI> to the tardy Progre&s;s of the <HI>Struma,</HI> and render its Termination &s;horter, as the Scurvy and <HI>Lues;</HI> in each of which is a con&s;iderable Degree of Acrimony, as is plain both from their Origin and Effects. They are to be di&s;cover'd by their proper Signs, and an exact and minute Enquiry into the Patient's former Way of Living, and into the Errors he may have committed in the Non-naturals &s;uffi|cient for producing this or the other Species of Acri|mony. By &s;uch a rigorous Enquiry into his Hi&s;tory, we &s;hall be able to judge more &s;afely on this Head, than we can otherwi&s;e do by any Signs whatever.</P>
<P>Both the abovementioned Di&s;tempers &s;hew them|&s;elves pretty clearly to the external Sen&s;es, as they appear for the mo&s;t part on the Surface of the Body. The Ulcers of the <HI>Lues</HI> have &s;ome Peculiarities, which will not allow us to mi&s;take them; and their Progre&s;s is &s;o regular and uniform that we need not often be deceiv'd.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ence of the Scurvy is not determin'd with more Difficulty than that of the other; but to determine its Species, will require more Sagacity than may be readily beliv'd by tho&s;e who have not made the Experiment. To the Want of this Di&s;tinction
<PB N="14" REF="28">we may impute the ill Succe&s;s with which the Scurvy is &s;o often treated, which need not &s;urprize us if we con&s;ider that one Species requires a Method of Cure oppo&s;ite to that of another, and a third has no Affinity with the other, either in its Origin or Method of Cure. In a word, they proceed from Cau&s;es entirely repugnant; and to attempt the Cure of the Scurvy by any one Sett of Medicines, would be ju&s;t as rea&s;onable as was the learned Bi&s;hop of <HI>C</HI> &mdash; <HI>ne</HI>'s hardy Attempt to cure both the Pleuri&s;y and Drop&s;y by his &s;ubtil <HI>Tar-Water.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever therefore undertakes the Cure of the <HI>Scrophula,</HI> mu&s;t examine with due Attention, whe|ther it is accompanied with the abovementioned, or any other Di&s;ea&s;es, that he may be able to draw a certain and faithful Indication.</P>
<P>The <HI>Diagno&s;is</HI> of this Malady was given before, and therefore nothing more need be &s;aid to it; and of the <HI>Progno&s;is</HI> what we have to &s;ay, will now be ea&s;ily apprehended.</P>
<P>The hereditary <HI>Struma</HI> is by much the wor&s;t Species, and the &s;ame is true of all original Di&s;ea&s;es, (for &s;o we may call them) which, as they have their E&s;&s;ence intermix'd with the fir&s;t Principles of Life, can &s;carcely be &s;eparated by a le&s;s Power than that which united them together; and tho' the Symp|toms of perhaps all Di&s;ea&s;es admit of &s;ome Miti|gation, yet the Experience of Antiquity as well as
<PB N="15" REF="29">our own, has taught us that the <HI>Labes Hereditaria,</HI> of almo&s;t every Kind, is incurable.</P>
<P>The next in Malignity we &s;hall e&s;teem that of tho&s;e Children who&s;e Parents were of a lax and weakly Habit, effeminate in their Way of Living, eating and drinking voluptuou&s;ly, and indulging a &s;edentary unactive Life; who, for Rea&s;ons we &s;hall not attempt to give, derive to their Offspring a weak and &s;ickly Machine &s;ubject to the Incroach|ment of many Di&s;ea&s;es (from which their Parents might yet be free) and unable to make a proper Defence, or to receive all the Benefit of Medicinal Aid. The&s;e, when attacked by the <HI>Scrophula,</HI> may indeed be relieved, and perhaps cur'd; but it will be nece&s;&s;ary at the &s;ame time to repair and improve that Con&s;titution which Nature had left imperfect, or rather which Nature's Antagoni&s;t had render'd &s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> Luxury in the Parents.</P>
<P>But other Children there are afflicted with this Di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e Parents were &s;trong, vigorous and healthy; and them&s;elves, when fir&s;t brought into the World in every Re&s;pect healthy as their Parents, and likely to continue &s;o; yet, the&s;e are, perhaps, pretty early attacked by this Di&s;ea&s;e. In the&s;e, therefore, it mu&s;t be attributed to &s;ome Error of the Non-naturals much aggravating that univer&s;al <HI>Diathe&s;is</HI> in Children, which was fir&s;t a&s;&s;ign'd as the genuine Source of the <HI>Scrophula</HI> The&s;e indeed have the faire&s;t Chance of a &s;ure and quick Relief from Medicine, as the Habit of Body was before very
<PB N="16" REF="30">good, and is fit for undergoing the Action of Me|dicines. The&s;e are indeed curable, and will rarely be di&s;appointed of a perfect Cure from the Method we &s;hall endeavour to deliver.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing in Order (for Order is here ne|ce&s;&s;ary) we have to do for the effectual Cure of this Di&s;temper, will be the Correction of that Cachexy which is the fundamental Cau&s;e of it. The Means of doing this, are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By corroborating the Ve&s;&s;els. <HI>2dly,</HI> By dimini&s;hing the Quantity of the morbific Matter, both in the <HI>primae viae</HI> and whole Body. <HI>3dly,</HI> By concocting the Remainder.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t Intention, a proper Regimen of the <HI>Nonnaturals</HI> mu&s;t be adapted, and on which it will principally depend: Let the Patient's Food be light and dry, not at all glutinous, but rather &s;omewhat a&s;tringent. Roa&s;ted Meats, well &s;ea&s;oned with Spices, &s;uch as are generally u&s;ed in the Kitchen, as Cinnamon, Mace, Cloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Bread exceed|ing well fermented, or &s;uch as has undergone that Proce&s;s a &s;econd Time, and made from the dryer and le&s;s glutinous Vegetables: To the&s;e may be added the dry Fruits of the <HI>Indies.</HI> His Liquors mu&s;t al&s;o be well fermented; and of the&s;e, the be&s;t are, fine old Ale, and the a&s;tringent Wines, if they are of a due Maturity, as <HI>Rheni&s;h, Red-Port,</HI> &amp;c. which will be much fitter for our Purpo&s;e, after being well impregnated with the dry Aromatics.</P>

<P>The Air is of no mean Importance here; the be&s;t is the dry, &s;erene, and &s;omewhat warm: If the Climate and Sea&s;on are contrary, we mu&s;t endea|vour to &s;upply their Defects within Doors; and for this Purpo&s;e a Situation remote from much Wood and Water, on a dry and barren Soil, defended from the rainy Winds, will be mo&s;t &s;uitable. The Hou&s;e it&s;elf ought to be exceeding clo&s;e, and pre&s;erved from Damp by large and con&s;tant Fires, and let its Windows confront the meridian Sun.

But there is another Cau&s;e of Relaxation be&s;ides that of Sleep it&s;elf, and which &s;eems not to have been
<PB N="19" REF="33">hitherto &s;ufficiently regarded, and that is, the Va|pour form'd around the Body by its own Atmo&s;|phere; which being confin'd, and as it were rever|berated by the Bed-Clothes, makes a true <HI>Balneum Vaporis,</HI> than which, a more powerful <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> is &s;carcely known for relaxing the Fibres of an ani|mal Body: And this feems to produce all the ill Effects we ob&s;erve from long Lying-a-bed, in tho&s;e who lie awake a con&s;iderable Part of the Time: Of this Cla&s;s, perhaps, may be &s;uppo&s;ed no &s;mall Num|ber of the Ladies of Ea&s;e; and this is probably one grand Cau&s;e of all tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es which are more peculiar to the Fair, and imputed to a lax and feeble Make of the Solids. The Atmo&s;phere we have been &s;peaking of, and which derives its Name from its Similitude to that &s;urrounding the Earth, is no more than the invi&s;ible Matter of Per&s;piration, ex|haling from every Point of the Body, and &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving it from the Injuries of the Air.</P>

This De&s;ign may be often effected in a con|&s;iderable Degree by Medicine, by means of the mu|tual Intercour&s;e we have been &s;peaking of; but other artful Means are al&s;o to be u&s;ed for exciting, alleviating, or diverting the Pa&s;&s;ions, which need not be mention'd here, as they don't properly belong to this Place. In the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e a chearful and lively Di&s;po&s;ition ought to be much encouraged, and the contrary to be diligently avoided or prevented. The fir&s;t affords a free and liberal Supply of Spirits, as well to the Heart and the other involuntary Or|gans, as tho&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient to the Will; and thus the Circulation dependent on them is bri&s;k and free, which is always to be our Study in this and the like Di&s;ea&s;es.

<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> Intention, or the Diminution of the morbific Matter, both in the <HI>primae viae</HI> and whole

The celebrated <HI>Ipec.</HI> which is now de&s;ervedly had in &s;o univer&s;al E&s;teem, is by much the &s;afe&s;t, and yet &s;ufficiently effectual: With this therefore alone, we &s;hall be contented in our pre&s;ent De&s;ign of evacuating the <HI>Vi&s;cid Pituit</HI> lodged in the Stomach, if we may be allow'd &s;ometimes on Occa&s;ion the <HI>Tartar. Emet.</HI> which, if the Do&s;e be a&s;certain'd with the requi&s;ite Exactne&s;s, may de&s;erve the &s;econd Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>latter</HI> Evacuation is effected by a Set of Medicines intended for that &s;ole U&s;e, under the ge|neral Name of <HI>Cathartics.</HI> But the judicious An|cients having ob&s;erved the various Effects of <HI>Cathar|tics,</HI> in producing a larger Di&s;charge of different Humors, have, with Care and Exactne&s;s enough, reduced them into proper Order, according to the&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="36">various Effects; and tho' they could not explain upon mechanical Principles their Cau&s;es or Manner of Operation, as not being well enough acquainted with the Laws of the animal Oeconomy, as deduced by the Light of modern Di&s;coveries, their Te&s;ti|monies are however founded on Experience and mo&s;t accurate Ob&s;ervation; nor does it &s;ignify to us, whether they have explain'd Effects from &s;ome &s;pecific, hidden, or chimerical Properties, or by the Qualities of Hot and Cold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is &s;ufficient that they have faithfully acquainted us with Matters of Fact, and give us the Liberty of embracing or re|jecting their Rea&s;oning. The&s;e &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es of purging Medicines derive their Names from the Humor they are ob&s;erved mo&s;t remarkably to act upon; and tho' in &s;ome of the Terms they have mi&s;took one Thing for another, a very little Can|dour will oblige us to excu&s;e this, and to admire that Sagacity, and extol the Indu&s;try that has laid the Foundation of almo&s;t all we know of the&s;e Matters, which de&s;erves our Confidence or the Appellation of Science.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es there is one Tribe peculiarly adapted to our Purpo&s;e of evacuating Phlegm out of the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, and thence called <GAP DESC="foreign">. Their Number is pretty con&s;iderable, as their Manner of Operation is various. We &s;hall divide them into two Cla&s;&s;es, of which,</P>
<PB N="23" REF="37">
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> are tho&s;e which dilute, attenuate, or re|&s;olve the vi&s;cid Matter, and &s;o render it fit for Expul|&s;ion. The&s;e are, 1. Water, which ought to be drank warm, with the Body lightly covered and expo&s;ed to a cool Air, to prevent its pa&s;&s;ing off by the Skin. 2. The &s;ame render'd &s;aponaceous with <HI>Sapo's,</HI> whether natural or artificial, as Honey, Sugar un|refined, Ca&s;&s;ia, Manna, common Soap, as that which bears the Name of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> or <HI>Venice, Sapo Philo&s;ophorum,</HI> and that natural one of Animals, the <HI>Bile.</HI> 3. The &s;ame Fluid [Water] impregnated with the &s;aponaceous Gums; which, by help al&s;o of their Acrimony, have a con&s;iderable &s;olvent Power, as <HI>G. Aloes, Ammoniac, Galbanum, Saga|pen.</HI> &amp;c. 4. A Solution of any of the chemical Salts which have a re&s;olvent Quality; &s;uch are the <HI>Tartar regenerat. Tart. vitriolat. Tart. &s;olub. Tart. &s;implex. Sal. Ammoniac. crud.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> Cla&s;s of <HI>Phlegmagogues</HI> comprehends all tho&s;e which are capable of giving &s;uch a <HI>Stimulus</HI> as is &s;ufficient, and not more than &s;ufficient, for in|crea&s;ing the <HI>peri&s;taltic</HI> Motion of the Inte&s;tines, by which they are to be di&s;charged of their Contents: The&s;e it is ea&s;y to &s;ee are to be endued with &s;uch an <HI>Acrimony</HI> as is not too naked and violent, or too volatile: The fir&s;t might bli&s;ter and inflame the tender and very &s;en&s;ible <HI>Tunica Villo&s;a,</HI> and produce a Train of the wor&s;t Symptoms, as Convul&s;ions, Dy&s;entery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The latter would not be con&s;tant
<PB N="24" REF="38">enough for promoting this con&s;tant Motion, and be therefore in&s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e therefore will be&s;t an&s;wer our End which have a moderate and corrigible Acrimony, or envelop'd in &s;ome vi&s;cid and glutinous Matter; and of this &s;ort are the following, which have many of them likewi&s;e a &s;olvent Power; <HI>Oxymel. Hiera Picra.</HI> Several Preparations of <HI>Mercury,</HI> of which the &s;afe&s;t and much the be&s;t is the <HI>Merc. Sublimat.

The Fruit and middle Bark of the <HI>Ebulus,</HI> Juice of <HI>Buckthorn,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our next De&s;ign is the Concoction of the mor|bific Matter in the Ve&s;&s;els, and whole Body; but before we proceed allow me to ob&s;erve, that this Coction is no more than &s;uch a Change of the morbid Matter, as renders it no longer noxious, but a&s;&s;imilates it &s;o much to the Nature of the &s;ound Fluids, as to fit it for pa&s;&s;ing thro' its Ve&s;&s;els without Hurt; and then it will no longer de&s;erve the Name of <HI>Morbid,</HI> but is tran&s;muted or concocted &s;o as to be an Humor <HI>Sanus;</HI> or, which is the &s;ame Thing, the Di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;es. How therefore is this happy Change to be effected? To this the An&s;wer is &s;hort,&mdash;By Nature her&s;elf: And if this Word be not acceptable, I &s;hall change it for another, the <HI>Vis Vitae,</HI> by which the De&s;ign is to be principally effected; tho' there is an additional Means to be afterwards mention'd, in which we &s;hall be much beholden to Art. And indeed we mu&s;t be &s;o here,
<PB N="25" REF="39">notwith&s;tanding our Expectation of &s;eeing it per|form'd by the Hand of Nature, the <HI>Vis Vitae,</HI> the Action of the Ve&s;&s;els, and the Force of the Circula|tion. As the&s;e have not been hitherto &s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e (or the Di&s;ea&s;e could not have taken Place) we mu&s;t render them &s;o by proper Methods; which are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By corroborating the Ve&s;&s;els. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By &s;timulating them. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> will render them fit for Contraction, and the <HI>latter</HI> will force them to it. The be&s;t Method of corroborating the Ve&s;&s;els has been already given <HI>ex Profe&s;&s;o.</HI> The <HI>Stimulus</HI> nece&s;&s;ary here, may be communicated by a Sett of Medicines, which have on this Account received the Name of <HI>Stimulantia;</HI> which, as they will be of eminent Service, de&s;erve in this Place to be ranged in &s;ome Order. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;hall be tho&s;e which act &s;o upon the Mind, as to produce a greater Influx of the nervous Fluid, by which the Heart and Arteries are made to contract with greater Force as well as Velocity; and this we ob&s;erve remarkably in &s;everal of the &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;ions, as will be &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated to any one who will take the Trouble of feeling the Pul&s;e of a Per&s;on under &s;uch an Agitation; and this is true in a le&s;s Degree of the chearful and lively Di&s;po&s;ition formerly mention'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>next</HI> and mo&s;t general Stimulants are the <HI>Acria</HI> of every Kind, but the&s;e are &s;o numerous that they cannot well be enumerated, and this will be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary&punc; only &s;hall be recommended
<PB N="26" REF="40">here: The&s;e are the <HI>Aromatics,</HI> of which the be&s;t are tho&s;e which are at the &s;ame Time <HI>Corroborants</HI> or <HI>A&s;tringents.</HI> Such are the greater Part of the following; the Barks of <HI>Cinnamon, Peru, Winter, Ca&s;&s;ia lignea,</HI> &amp;c. The Roots of <HI>Gentian, Ginger, Imperatorium, Valerian, Calamus Aroma|ticus, Galangal,</HI> &amp;c. Seeds of <HI>Cardamomum, Mu&s;tard,</HI> &amp;c. The Leaves of the <HI>Abrotanum, Ab&s;inthium, Ruta, Sabin,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Tribe of <HI>Stimulants</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e Things, which cannot be referred to either of the other two Orders, &s;uch as Fire, Wounding In&s;tru|ments, Motion or Exerci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Having now laid down the Method by which Nature is to be enabled to concoct the morbid Matter, let us con&s;ider what further A&s;&s;i&s;tance can be given to this Work by &s;imple Art. The vi&s;cid <HI>Pituit</HI> which con&s;titutes the Di&s;ea&s;e, is to be attenuated and divided; and therefore our Indication commands the U&s;e of tho&s;e Medicines, which are capable by a &s;ole men&s;trual Power of inciding and attenuating. Some &s;uch valuable Medicines indeed we have, who&s;e men&s;trual Force is perhaps much greater than is generally &s;uppos'd: The following are the principal, <HI>viz.</HI> The neutral Salts, as the <HI>Tartar regenerat. Tartar &s;olub. Tartar Vitriolat.</HI> the <HI>Spiritus Mindereri,</HI> which is indeed an excellent Re&s;olvent, and &s;eems well to de&s;erve the Reputation it has acquired in a very few Years, a neutral Spirit
<PB N="27" REF="41">made for the mo&s;t Part extemporaneou&s;ly, by the Affu&s;ion of Juice of <HI>Lemons</HI> on the <HI>Sal. Ab&s;inth.</HI> or any other fix'd <HI>Alcaline</HI> Salt; the crude <HI>Sal. Armoniac.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget another Medicine, which &s;eems to be endu'd with almo&s;t all the Properties we could wi&s;h for our Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> of di&s;&s;olving, &s;timul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ting, and attenuating; I mean the <HI>Aq. Calc.</HI> which, if It is u&s;ed fre&s;h, (as it always ought to be will perhaps pre&s;erve it's Qualities, through the whole Cour&s;e of Circulation, more perfectly than any Medicine we are acquainted with.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e ine&s;timable Preparations we are obliged to Chemi&s;try; they perhaps de&s;erve to be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t univer&s;al Medicines we are acquainted with; and the U&s;e of them is never to be forgot in this Di&s;ea&s;e, but to be in&s;i&s;ted on with the greate&s;t Care and Diligence from the Beginning to the Compleating the Cure.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to direct my learned Reader in the Choice, Order and Method, of pre&s;cribing the Medicines, as all the&s;e will vary according to Circum&s;tances; but it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve that tho&s;e which dilute and attenuate are always fir&s;t to be u&s;ed, and that for a competent Time; and when this End is obtain'd, the Expul&s;ion of the re&s;olved or concocted Matter will be ea&s;y. But
<PB N="28" REF="42">the <HI>Attenuantia,</HI> if prudently cho&s;en, can never be given un&s;ea&s;onably.</P>
<P>We have now treated of our great De&s;ign of correcting the univer&s;al <HI>Cachexy,</HI> and we are next to con&s;ider the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Method of taking away the Tumours: And this is threefold. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By Re&s;olution. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By Suppuration. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By the Knife. The Re&s;olution of this Sort of Tumours will be difficult enough, nor ought it to be attempted in their more advanc'd State; tho&s;e only being fit for Re&s;olution which are recent, gentle, and where other Circum&s;tances are the be&s;t, and then it is to be perform'd if it can be perform'd at all: 1. By the internal Medicines for correcting and eradicating the proximate Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. 2. By Topical Applications, of which perhaps the be&s;t will be in Form of Vapour: For this Purpo&s;e the <HI>Anti&s;eptics</HI> are be&s;t, as Vinegar, who&s;e Vapour may be directed through a Tunnel. The <HI>Anti&s;eptic</HI> Gums may be likewi&s;e very fitly apply'd in the Form of Plai&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t longer on this Re&s;olution as we are not acquainted with any better Methods for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Suppuration of the&s;e ob&s;tinate Tumours is to be attempted by the Application of tho&s;e Sub&s;tances we generally term <HI>Maturants,</HI> or <HI>Sup|purants;</HI> which, tho' &s;uppps'd to operate in &s;ome hidden or &s;pecific Manner, do no more than confine,
<PB N="29" REF="43">and, if the Term be allowable, reverberate the natural Heat, and by this Means promote that Change, which Nature her&s;elf only can effect, of the morbid Matter into <HI>Pus.</HI> Thus all glutinous, oily, or farinaceous Sub&s;tances, become <HI>Suppurants,</HI> when apply'd in the Form of Plai&s;ter or Poultice; &s;uch are Bal&s;ams, mo&s;t Re&s;ins, Meal of Barley, Oats, or Wheat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e will not be le&s;s effectual if they have added to them &s;ome &s;mall Degree of <HI>Acrimony.</HI> When the Tumour is &s;uppurated, and not till the Proce&s;s is quite perfected, it may be open'd at Di&s;cretion, either by Inci&s;ion or the potential <HI>Cautery,</HI> and then the Ulcer is to be treated like an ordinary one, by the common <HI>Detergents.</HI></P>
<P>But neither Re&s;olution nor Suppuration will &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, and this is when the Tumour is very hard; and when this happens we have but one Method to chu&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Extirpation by the Knife, according to the ordinary Rules of Art; but this Operation is not to be undertaken without well con&s;idering the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e: If, however, the Di&s;ea&s;e be not inveterate, and the Tumour is benign, it may be extirpated; but not without ob&s;erving it's Situation, and Proximity to the larger Ve&s;&s;els, which will &s;ometimes ab&s;o|lutely forbid it.</P>
<P>The exulcerated Tumour is next to be treated of, and is to be healed, 1. By internal Medicines,
<PB N="30" REF="44"><HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as may correct the putrid <HI>Acrimony,</HI> which has now contaminated the whole fluid Ma&s;s, and is likely to produce a <HI>Pthi&s;is multiplex:</HI> This is to be done by mild, demulcent Medicines, together with the <HI>Anti&s;eptics.</HI> For this Purpo&s;e the U&s;e of Milk is to be in&s;i&s;ted on, together with &s;uch Medicines as be&s;t an&s;wer this Intention; &s;uch are the native Bal&s;ams, <HI>viz. Turpentine, Tar, Bal&s;. Capivi,</HI> &amp;c. 2. By de&s;troying the Remainder of the Tumour and fungous Fle&s;h by <HI>E&s;charotics,</HI> together with the ordinary <HI>Detergents</HI> mixed with them; and when this is done the <HI>Cicatrizantia</HI> are to be apply'd.</P>
<P>There is another Kind, or rather Form, of the exulcerated <HI>Struma,</HI> which preys upon the <HI>Mem|brana Cellulo&s;a,</HI> betwixt the Mu&s;cles, forming large <HI>Sinus</HI>'s betwixt them; and the&s;e will be difficultly healed, as indeed are all other <HI>Sinus</HI>'s betwixt Mu&s;cles: The&s;e are, however, to be treated much like others, <HI>viz.</HI> By filling them with Dige&s;tives and injecting <HI>Determents.</HI> 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee that this Manner of treating them (and we are not acquainted with a better) will require a very con&s;iderable Time for the healing of &s;uch very deep Ulcers. When the Tendons, Articulations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are affected in the Manner we formerly de&s;crib'd, they are to be treated like ordinary <HI>Apo&s;tems,</HI> Care being taken to correct as much as po&s;&s;ible the putrid <HI>Diathe&s;is</HI> of the Blood, by the Method above pre&s;crib'd. It &s;eems unne|ce&s;&s;ary to mention, after what has been &s;aid already,
<PB N="31" REF="45">that if we di&s;cover any Signs of the Scurvy, or <HI>Lues,</HI> they are to be treated according to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Rules of treating tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es; and if any Contra-Indications &s;hould occur we can never be at a Lo&s;s, if governed by that Golden Axiom of the Schools;</P>
<Q>Ubi Indicatio impar &s;imul urget, tum &s;emper erit &s;atisfaciendum maximae.</Q>
<P>Thus I hope to have given &s;uch a Method of Cure in this ob&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;e, as will not need further Explication: If it is per&s;i&s;ted in with the Re&s;olution always to be expected from tho&s;e who wait for the Cure of Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, we cannot doubt of all the Succe&s;s which it is in the Power of Art to give. To say more will be &s;uperfluous; I therefore &s;hall proceed to &s;ome other Matters relating to this Malady, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;ider'd by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be Ma&s;ters of the Subject.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing which de&s;erves our Animadver|&s;ion, is the common Complaint of it's Return, after the Tumours, or Ulcers, have been extirpated and healed. 'Tis true, this is often the Ca&s;e, and is no &s;mall Di&s;couragement to the Patient and his Friends; and &s;ometimes obliges them to &s;it down contented with believing that the Malady is incurable. But the Rea&s;on of all this is not difficult; they have attempted the Cure of the Di&s;ea&s;e without eradi|cating it's real Cau&s;e or E&s;&s;ence, the external
<PB N="32" REF="46">Appearances, being no more than the Product or Effects of the other. 'Tis no Wonder, therefore, that they have been di&s;appointed, and that the Tumours return very soon after they have been taken away; and, indeed, to expect a Cure from this Method, is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable as it would be to hope for the Cure of an Inflammation by the Use of an Opiate</P>
<P>As the U&s;e of Mercury has been much recom|mended in this Disease, we cannot avoid taking notice of it, and giving our Rea&s;ons for not mention|ing it, in delivering the Method of Cure. We &s;hall fir&s;t therefore ob&s;erve in what manner it ope|rates, &s;o as to produce Salivation; and this is now generally agreed to depend on the Weight and Figure of its Parts, by which it increa&s;es the <HI>Momentum</HI> of the Blood, divides the Globules, and de&s;troys their attracting Force; in a word, di&s;&s;olves a great Part of the Ma&s;s into a putrid <HI>Tabum,</HI> and fits it for pa&s;&s;ing readily off by the &s;ecretory Organs, which however happens almo&s;t con&s;tantly (for Rea&s;ons we &s;hall not now attempt to give) by the &s;alivary Glands. This wonderful Effect of a wonderful Fluid does not &s;eem to depend on any other Prin|ciples than the&s;e we have given; and therefore it appears to act chiefly on the red Globules of Blood, and that the phlegmatic Particles cannot be ea&s;ily attenuated by it even whil&s;t in the Ve&s;&s;els; and this will be much le&s;s probable when out of the Laws of Circulation, as the Glands may in &s;ome
<PB N="33" REF="47">&s;en&s;e be &s;aid to be. But if Mercury cannot eradi|cate the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, when in its recent State, it will be much le&s;s beneficial, yea, an ab&s;o|lute Poi&s;on, when the Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o far advanced as to have produced a Suppuration; and when the Tendons, Articulations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are affected, when the <HI>Pus</HI> being ab&s;orb'd and convey'd into the Blood, contaminates the the whole Ma&s;s with the putrid Acrimony, and thence produces an univer&s;al and de&s;perate <HI>Phthi&s;is:</HI> In this ca&s;e, I say, Quick&s;ilver cannot be exhibited without the wor&s;t Effects The putrid <HI>Diathe&s;is</HI> of the Blood was already &s;uch as threatned inevitable Death, and is the whole Ma&s;s to be now render'd in a wor&s;e degree putrid? which is the genuine Effect of Mercury; nor is this all, the augmented Velocity of the Blood augments the Hectic Fever, and thus every Thing con&s;pires to|wards a fatal Period.</P>
<P>The Reader has perhaps already wonder'd that no mention has yet been made of Mineral Waters in the Cure of the <HI>Scrophula,</HI> which mu&s;t be excus'd by &s;aying, we de&s;ignedly referred him hither for the &s;ake of &s;hewing the U&s;e which has been di&s;cover'd in one of our own Mineral Waters for that Pur|po&s;e; I mean the celebrated Spaw at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> who&s;e Reputation, which long and repeated Ex|perience has acquir'd it, is not more than equal to its Merit. We &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate very &s;oon, that its con&s;tituent Principles are &s;uch as render it as univer&s;ally u&s;eful, as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for any
<PB N="34" REF="48">Mineral Water to be, or as any Medicine which the benevolent Hand of Nature has hitherto pointed out for the Pre&s;ervation or Re&s;toration of the Health of Mortals. 'Tis indeed impo&s;&s;ible for us to avoid the Su&s;picion of Prejudice in treating on this Sub|ject; but we beg leave to ob&s;erve, that neither that Su&s;picion, nor any other Rea&s;on ought to deter us from doing Ju&s;tice to the Cau&s;e of Truth, or from publi&s;hing it when it concerns the Welfare of the Community and the Happine&s;s of Mankind. But we &s;hall endeavour to prove, that this Character of the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Spaw-Waters is more than a Pane|gyric, and that they are adapted to the Cure of very many ob&s;tinate Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, tho' of few more aptly than the <HI>Scrophula;</HI> in which our grand Intention has been to evacuate the vi&s;cid Matter out of the <HI>primae Viae,</HI> to attenuate the Fluids, gently to &s;timulate the Solids, and to invigorate the Spirits; and I appeal to the Judgment of the Learned whether the&s;e Indications are not the mo&s;t univer&s;al ones we are acquainted with, for eradicating the fir&s;t Cau&s;e or Sour&s;e of the whole Chronic Tribe. In order therefore to determine the Merit of the&s;e Waters, let us con&s;ider their Principles &s;eparately; which is, doubtle&s;s, the mo&s;t certain Method of de|termining the real Properties and Value of Medi|cines, or Medicinal Waters; as by this means only we can be enabled to judge of their Manner of Operation, and of explaining all their <HI>Phaenomena.</HI> We know it is objected, and that truly, that the component Parts of Bodies cannot be &s;uppos'd to
<PB N="35" REF="49">have exi&s;ted in the &s;ame Form before their Separa|tion, as after they are divided by the Action of Fire; and that therefore a Chemical Analy&s;is is not &s;uffi|cient for teaching us their Properties, as it does not &s;hew us in what Form they exi&s;ted before this Se|paration, and how the &s;everal heterogeneous Par|ticles were united; &s;ince on the Form of their previous Exi&s;tence and Manner of Union will very much depend their Effects. This Objection, as we have already confe&s;&s;ed, is ju&s;t; but it is punctually &s;o of tho&s;e &s;olid Bodies, which cannot be analy&s;ed without extreme Torture of the Fire, in which the whole Proce&s;s is perform'd with Violence; but this is not the ca&s;e with fluid Bodies, and tho&s;e of a le&s;s firm Texture; for of the&s;e we can di&s;cover the con&s;tituent Principles, and their Proportions, to each other, with little Force and great Certainty, and can determine their Effects with happy Exactne&s;s. In the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Spaw-Water, accurate and judicious Experiment has di&s;cover'd the following Principles.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> An Aqueous Fluid differing very little in any of its &s;en&s;ible Properties from common di&s;tilled Water, from which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible by any Sort of Trial to di&s;tingui&s;h it; from whence let us learn that the Medicinal Virtues of the Spaw Water don't re&s;ide in this very &s;imple Fluid.</P>
<P>We are now to con&s;ider what Medicinal U&s;es this &s;imple Water retains, in order to under&s;tand the Effects of that compound Fluid of which it
<PB N="36" REF="50">con&s;titutes &s;o great a Part. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it is as we shall afterwards &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;uitable, and indeed the only &s;uitable, <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> for di&s;&s;olving the other Principles, and rendering them as effectual as po&s;&s;ible by conveying them into the mo&s;t minute Branches of the Va&s;cular Sy&s;tem; as it is the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Fluid we are acquainted with, Mercury excepted, and cap|able of pa&s;&s;ing thro' Ve&s;&s;els of inconceivable Small|ne&s;s; and the famous <HI>Florentine</HI> Experiment has taught us, that it is capable of pa&s;&s;ing thro' the lea&s;t porous, that is mo&s;t &s;olid, of all &s;olid Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> Gold. This Property alone is &s;ufficient to render it, valuable as a <HI>Men&s;truum,</HI> and the Smoothne&s;s of its Particles is &s;uch, as renders it entirely innocent; for it does not di&s;cover the lea&s;t Degree of <HI>Acrimony</HI> when apply'd to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part of an Animal Body, <HI>viz.</HI> the Eye; but on the contrary, is one of the mo&s;t general <HI>Antacria.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The &s;everal Properties of Elementary Water, which cannot be fitly recited here, will &s;hew us, and the Experience of Antiquity has confirm'd it, that Water the mo&s;t common, and for that Rea&s;on the mo&s;t neglected of all Medicines, ought to be e&s;teem'd one of the mo&s;t univer&s;al. If it be true that the much greater Part of Di&s;ea&s;es proceed from Ob&s;truction, that Medicine will be mo&s;t generally u&s;eful which be&s;t an&s;wers the Indications which Ob&s;tructions in general require; and the two chief of the&s;e are, to attenuate and relax. Whether are not the&s;e the remarkable
<PB N="37" REF="51">Effects of Water? In acute Di&s;ea&s;es the Ob&s;truction is attended with a Fever, and the&s;e con&s;titute an Inflammation, and then another additional <HI>Po&s;tula|tum</HI> is required in the Indication, <HI>viz.</HI> to moderate the Fever by cooling, diluting, correcting <HI>Acrimony;</HI> and how beautifully are all the&s;e perform'd by Water? Nor can they be perform'd without it. I don't mean by this that &s;imple Water is only fit or nece&s;&s;ary for all the&s;e Purpo&s;es; by no Means: But all the Emul&s;ions, Infu&s;ions, Decoctions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are or can be given in acute Di&s;ea&s;es, con&s;i&s;t for the far greate&s;t Part of Elementary Water. We need not therefore wonder, that <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> the &s;agacious and incomparable <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> in &s;peaking of <HI>Panacea</HI>'s, numbers Water among&s;t the <HI>quatuor Remedia maxim&egrave; univer&s;alia.</HI> I am far from intending by this to extol this Medicine beyond its due Merit, or to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of a late Writer, who weakly undertook to prove it a Cure for every Di&s;ea&s;e: No; let me be allow'd this Opportunity of declaring my&s;elf a profe&s;s'd Enemy to all the <HI>Panacea</HI>'s, which Ignorance, Avarice, or Vain-Glory, have hitherto introduc'd into the World; and which have no Foundation in the E&s;&s;ence of Things, but are contrary to the known Laws of Nature; and a very &s;mall Share of plain Philo&s;ophy, or indeed of plain Sen&s;e, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew them contrary both to Philo&s;ophy and Sen&s;e. But the Subject naturally led, or rather obliged me, to &s;peak of the Virtues of Water, and to do Ju&s;tice to its Merit.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="52">
<P>The next and chief Principle of the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Water is a neutral purgative Salt (as indeed all neutral Salts are purgative when directed by a proper Regimen) of a remarkably bitter Ta&s;te, readily di&s;&s;olving in the Mouth, its Pungency &s;eeming to penetrate deep into the Tongue, tho' without im|pre&s;&s;ing any nau&s;eous Sen&s;ation. It ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olves in the Air, tho' not near &s;o readily as the <HI>Tart. Regenerat.</HI> and very quickly in twice its Weight of cold Water.</P>
<P>The&s;e Properties only are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that this Salt appears at lea&s;t <HI>a priori</HI> to be an excellent <HI>Deob&s;truent,</HI> as all neutral Salts de&s;erve to be e&s;teem'd. Rational and Experimental Chemi&s;try has taught us, that they have a &s;urprizing &s;olvent Power, and are therefore in a fluid Form the fitte&s;t Medicines we know of in the greater Part of chronic Di&s;ea&s;es. Long and repeated Experience has al&s;o taught, that the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Salt or Water are wonderfully &s;afe, and have produced as &s;ew ill Effects as any efficacious Medicine can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do: But this, like all other Medicines, ought to be admini&s;ter'd by a judicious Hand, to tho&s;e who expect all its Advantages without any Inconveniences, which may well be expected from the imprudent or un&s;ea&s;onable U&s;e of the be&s;t Remedies in Nature; tho' the&s;e are, perhaps, no where fewer than in the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Salt and Water. It don't appear ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this Place to repeat what has been already
<PB N="39" REF="53">&s;aid or neutral Medicines: They were believed, if not demon&s;trated, to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful Cla&s;s of Remedies in the Cure not only of the <HI>Scrophula,</HI> but of the greater Part of chronic Di&s;ea&s;es. If this be true, or &s;hall be granted by the Adepts in Phy&s;ick, the <HI>Spaw</HI>-Waters of <HI>Scarborough</HI> will certainly de|&s;erve their Regard, E&s;teem, and Recommendation.</P>
<P>The Salt may be given like other Neutrals, either as a Purgative or Alterant, by proportioning the Do&s;e to the Intention: Its Action may likewi&s;e, by a proper Regimen, be directed to the Kidneys; and it &s;eems not le&s;s fit for an&s;wering the be&s;t Intentions of a <HI>Diuretic</HI> than any other Medicine of that Denomination. Its Operation is mild, ea&s;y, and gentle, and in this differs from mo&s;t other <HI>Cathartics,</HI> that it revives and exhilarates the Spirits, producing and leaving after it a chearful Bri&s;kne&s;s; an Effect, I &s;ay, contrary to that of mo&s;t other Purgatives, which generally fatigue the Body, and depre&s;s the Spirits.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> There is another Salt in this Water to be &s;eperated from it after the Chry&s;tallization of the other, and appears no other than common Sea Salt, who&s;e &s;ingular Properties it di&s;covers on every Experiment. Its Quantity is but &s;mall, being only to the other in the Proportion of 1 to 18. Its Effects mu&s;t con&s;equently be incon&s;iderable: It will, however, be allow'd to promote, in &s;ome &s;mall
<PB N="40" REF="54">Degree, the Operation of the Waters, and contri|bute to the pre&s;erving it from Putrefaction.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> Principle is a white Powder or Earth, which the mo&s;t ingenious Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> calls an <HI>Alcaline</HI> Sub&s;tance, as it effervates with all Acids, and changes the Syrup of Violets green. To this Earth are probably owing the good Effects, daily experienced, from drinking the&s;e Waters after the immoderate U&s;e of Wine, by correcting the Acidity which &s;uch Liquors contain and di&s;cover by their ill Effects in the Stomach.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth</HI> Principle of the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Waters is Air, and this it will be &s;aid is contain'd in all Water; and indeed it had been unnece&s;&s;ary to have taken notice of it here as a Principle, but that it is ob&s;erv'd in &s;omewhat more than ordinary Proportion. Of this Air we &s;hall &s;ay no more than that to it is con&s;iderably owing its bri&s;k Ta&s;te, and perhaps its quicker Operation.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> A Mineral Spirit con&s;i&s;ting of Particles of Iron exceedingly &s;ubtiliz'd: The&s;e are in no incon&s;iderable Proportion, and mu&s;t produce in &s;ome Degree the excellent Effects of <HI>Chalybeate</HI> Preparations, than which no Medicines we are ac|quainted with more effectually corroborate the Ve&s;&s;els, attenuate the Fluids, increa&s;e the Circula|tion, and invigorate the Spirits. This Spirit is in|conceivably volatile, almo&s;t as much &s;o as Heat it&s;elf,
<PB N="41" REF="55">and &s;carcely to be confin'd by any Art, which makes it nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to have the entire Virtues of the Water, to drink it at the Well.</P>
<P>Thus much on the <HI>Scarborough Spaw</HI>-Waters may be &s;ufficient to give &s;uch an Idea of their Nature and Properties, as may &s;hew how well they are adapted to the Cure not only of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which has been the Subject of this E&s;&s;ay, but of the greater Part of the formidable Chronic Tribe.</P>
