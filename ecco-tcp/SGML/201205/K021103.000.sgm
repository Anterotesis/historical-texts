<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING no other News, I am tempted to &s;end you, with &s;ome Remarks upon it, a Di&s;cour&s;e that lately came to my Hands, &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>from a Merchant in</HI> London, <HI>to a Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;ician, with the Phy&s;ician's An&s;wer.</HI> The Subject of the Di&s;cour&s;e being, <HI>The pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;ick and Surgery;</HI> at my entrance upon it I could not judg the Author le&s;s than a <HI>Drug&s;ter,</HI> as knowing no other Merchants &s;o nearly concerned with Phy&s;ick. But reading on, and finding him complain of the Luxuriant U&s;e of Medicines, it was natural to conclude he had been &s;ome great Sufferer. But coming at length to the Phy&s;ician's An&s;wer, and finding that &s;o like the Product of one and the &s;ame Ingeny; I was tempted to think the Merchant broke, and lately turned Phy&s;ician; or the Phy|&s;ician wanting Bu&s;ine&s;s, to have newly took up the Trade of a Merchant. But I had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed the whole Treati&s;e, than I found out the My&s;|tery and Bottom of the Bu&s;ine&s;s to be no le&s;s than a War proclaimed by one Company of Merchants again&s;t another for interloping; or (to be plain) the Apothecaries having been trading in that part, which the Phy&s;icians count their proper Province, the <HI>Doctors</HI> as an Act of Ho&s;tility retaliate, and are tur|ned <HI>Apothecaries.</HI></P>
<P>What may be the con&s;equence of this Breach of the Peace, time mu&s;t mani|fe&s;t; but I hope, Sir, you who are known to be a di&s;intere&s;ted Per&s;on, and as &s;uch a more proper and fit Judg of the Grounds and Management of the War, may in&s;inuate &s;omething that may be a more proper Medium to compo&s;e the Difference, or at lea&s;t more advantageous to the People, who mu&s;t bear the Charge of the War, than any thing has been &s;aid, or is likely to be done by ei|ther Party.</P>
<P>Here are forty &s;ix Doctor-Apothecaries, again&s;t a thou&s;and Apothecary-Doc|tors, which is great Odds. But the Apothecaries &s;ay, 'tis the Doctors Fear that multiplies them beyond the true Number: Be it &s;o, the Doctors &s;hew their Valour the more, &s;ince they are re&s;olved to engage; and I don't know but if they can bring in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies as Auxiliaries, as they &s;eem to threaten, by in&s;inuating the Merchants Concern and Acquaintance
<PB N="4" REF="3">with their Affairs, they will be capable to ruin more than 1000 Cli&s;ter-pipe Men Hor&s;e and Foot; the Doctors them&s;elves being all 46 Commi&s;&s;ion-Offi|cers: Tho the Apothecaries &s;ay one half of them are as unfit for their Profe&s;|&s;ion as other Folks; 'tis only the Virtue of <HI>L.</HI> and <HI>M.</HI> makes them the &s;ame Doctors in the Common Cau&s;e, and able to &s;ay, <HI>Nos Poma.</HI></P>
<P>Well, the Merchant-Phy&s;ician, or Doctor-Apothecary (which he plea&s;es) exhibits divers Articles again&s;t the Apothecary-Doctors, as a ju&s;t Cau&s;e of ta|king up Arms, having received them at an Evening-Mu&s;ter at the College, after Orders given concerning a large Confluence of Sick and Maimed, &s;ome Merchants no doubt.</P>
<P>In the Preface to the Di&s;cour&s;e he a&s;&s;erts,</P>
<P><Q>'<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Apothecaries have often reproach'd the Phy&s;icians, that the Poor were left to their Care, and that they neglected the Pharmaceu|tick Part, or Preparation of Remedies now lodged in them&s;elves. But the Doctor is convinc'd that the Di&s;pen&s;ary is the greate&s;t Relief to the Poor, who have the <HI>be&s;t Advice and be&s;t Phy&s;ick</HI> at very &s;mall Expence. The Phy&s;icians are often con&s;idering the Drugs, carefully viewing the common Preparations, improving them, and adding others which they think or judg more u&s;eful.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the Phy&s;icians have not been reproached without Cau&s;e, they have not hitherto been u&s;ed to give Advice to large Con|fluences of &s;ick Per&s;ons <HI>Gratis:</HI> having no Remedies to &s;ell to them that had no Fees to give, the Poor have been forced to go to them that had, or wholly to let Nature alone to &s;truggle with its Di&s;ea&s;es. Nor have the Phy&s;icians only neglected, but been ignorant of the Pharmaceutick Part. Neither can the A|pothecaries any more than the Phy&s;icians pretend them&s;elves compleat herein, being generally alike ignorant of the chief and mo&s;t artful Part, <HI>Pyrotechny,</HI> leaving its mo&s;t effectual Preparations to the Care of tho&s;e, who&s;e Care is only how they may make them, not mo&s;t adapted to the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, but to their be&s;t Advantage; profe&s;&s;ing no Skill in Di&s;ea&s;es, or the Virtues of what they make in order to remove them.</P>
<P>But the Di&s;pen&s;ary, tho it be an Acknowledgment of the Faults the Phy|&s;icians have been reproached with, is not the greate&s;t relief to the Poor; nor have we more than their own Words to a&s;&s;ure us that they will, yea or can afford the be&s;t Advice, and the be&s;t Medicines cheaper than other Phy&s;ici|ans.</P>
<P>That they can give the be&s;t Advice is but their own immode&s;t Boa&s;t; but that they are &s;o &s;oon become the be&s;t skilled in Pharmaceuticks, tho with the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a few poor Apothecaries among&s;t them, we know 'tis very unlike|ly, if not impo&s;&s;ible; or that they can con&s;ider the Drugs, much farther than to know them by Sight, &s;ince they have but lately dealt that way; nor
<PB N="5" REF="4">are they much more likely to improve or add to the common Preparations. But,</P>
<P><Q>'<HI>Secondly,</HI> He &s;ays the Citizens often complain to the Phy&s;icians of the very chargeable Bills of the Apothecaries, and declare their Jealou&s;y of a Combination, in multiplying Medicines and Do&s;es needle&s;sly. But the Di&s;pen&s;ary relieves the fir&s;t by &s;elling almo&s;t at the fir&s;t Co&s;t, or 18 in 20 cheaper than the Apothecaries. And the Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;icians being under no Engagements with the Apothecaries, cure with one or few Pre&s;criptions in le&s;s difficult Ca&s;es, and with no more than nece&s;&s;ary in the more dange|rous (avoiding all Medicines acting on Nature with more or le&s;s Violence) the more hazardous extreme: The Charge under 10 or 20 <HI>s.</HI> in a Fever or the Smallpox, in&s;tead of &s;o many Pounds; many require not more than three or four Shillings worth, which by &s;ubdividing into Boles, Pouders and Draughts, come in a Bill to four or five Pounds.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Apothecaries Bills no doubt have been larger or &s;maller ac|cording to the Proportion of their Con&s;ciences; it cannot fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed, they have been all alike culpable: but it is no wonder the People have com|plained of the dearne&s;s of the Wares, where the Brokers have been &s;o well paid for advi&s;ing to the Bargain; two Charges mu&s;t needs look great, where one had been enough, and Advice and Medicines too might have been afforded at the Charge of either. A Combination between Doc|tors and Apothecaries, where there was a mutual Dependance, was but natu|ral; <HI>Manus Manum fricat.</HI> But now it is pa&s;t doubt, &s;ince the Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;icians declare, they are at pre&s;ent under no Engagements to the A|pothecaries.</P>
<P>But the Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;icians &s;ay, they are now re&s;olved to be hone&s;t, and &s;ell their Remedies almo&s;t at the fir&s;t Co&s;t. <HI>Almo&s;t and hard by,</HI> &amp;c. but if they &s;ell &s;o cheap, and u&s;e but few Pre&s;criptions, I doubt they will not be over|&s;paring in their Vi&s;its, or lower their Fees which may make amends, tho they give their Phy&s;ick unvalued; but how can we be a&s;&s;ured, that they will, or rather that they can cure with <HI>one, few,</HI> or <HI>no more than are nece&s;&s;ary?</HI> Pre&s;criptions I do not know, unle&s;s they fir&s;t demon&s;trate by their Practice that their Skill is greater than other Phy&s;icians, which is yet to be done. But they di&s;cover their Di&s;cretion more than their Skill, in avoiding the more active Medicines. <HI>'Tis dangerous medling with Edg-Tools,</HI> by tho&s;e that have not been u&s;ed to handle them: a Bone Knife is fit for Children, that they may not cut one another; but if Phy&s;icians &s;hould venture to u&s;e more active Remedies, Di&s;tempers might terminate one way or other too &s;oon, to require many Vi&s;its, and con&s;equently fewer Fees would be gotten. But Gentlemen may have the Small Pox, or Fever cured for ten or twenty Shillings, which we mu&s;t un|der&s;tand in Medicines, and that &s;ometimes is very dear, when as the&s;e Di&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es
<PB N="6" REF="5">commonly are cured by Nature without A&s;&s;i&s;tance: Many Di&s;ea&s;es they &s;ay for three or four Shillings; but what the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es are, it were good al&s;o to know, whether Tooth-ach or Corns; and what Fees are required be&s;ides, and whether the Di&s;pen&s;ary Men will tru&s;t. But,</P>
<Q><P>'<HI>Thirdly,</HI> &s;ays he, the Apothecaries have kept the Doctors many Years un|der the dread of their Power, who they &s;ay command in all Families, and can bring in and turn out whom they plea&s;e; they govern as a Tyrant his Sub|jects, making them obedient by grievous Taxes; &s;o that they dare not con|&s;ult a Phy&s;ician, unle&s;s at the la&s;t Extremity. Phy&s;icians would govern their Patients by their own Rea&s;on: The Patients have the Liberty of cheap Phy|&s;ick, and of con&s;ulting at a beginning of a Di&s;temper, &s;ecure from expence which &s;hall &s;urprize. The Phy&s;icians would prevent their own Ruin, chiefly from their be&s;t Succe&s;s.'</P>
<P>'This has hitherto been the Ca&s;e of the Faculty; if they conquer'd a Di&s;|temper, the Remedy (tho not the manner of u&s;ing it) becomes the Apo|thecaries <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> and the Doctor is left to invent more. The Di&s;pen&s;ary complies with the two Propo&s;als of the Apothecaries, removes the Peoples Complaint and Jealou&s;y of a Cheat put on them by all Phy&s;icians, and gives the Licen&s;e to him to u&s;e his own Method and Pre&s;cripts, to his Patients Ad|vantage and his own.'</P>
<P>'The Apothecary cannot complain he is injur'd: for as he &s;eizes on the ad|vi&s;ing Part, as a Dependency he would annex to the Shop-Trade; the other from the Example brings them both together, the better to &s;erve the Publick. If the Apothecary proves an Ambo-dexter, feels the Pul&s;e with one hand, and makes Medicines with the other; why may not the College plea&s;e the People with the &s;ame Dexterity? unle&s;s (which is rea&s;onable in the Ca&s;e of Life and Health) the Apothecaries will wholly practi&s;e the judicial Part, and leave the mini&s;terial, of making Medicines, to the Phy&s;ician.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It is a &s;hame for Phy&s;icians to confe&s;s, that the Apothecaries have kept the Doctors many Years under the Fear of their Power, or that they &s;hould command in all Families: indeed it &s;eems natural for the People to ask the Apothecary, who is the mo&s;t skilful Phy&s;ician, he being more capable to judg than the People; and on this account they have had a Capacity to recom|mend &s;uch as they thought would pre&s;cribe be&s;t either for the Patients or the A|pothecaries Di&s;ea&s;e, which &s;oever lay with mo&s;t pain on his Mind: but how they &s;hould make them obedient by taxing hard, I do not &s;ee, unle&s;s one e|vil being le&s;s than two, they chu&s;e to &s;ubmit them&s;elves wholly to the Apothe|carys Care, if not fearing the Fees more than the Bill, yet being &s;ure both would be much heavier; &s;o that only Extremity or Experience of the Apothecarys in|&s;ufficiency could make them &s;ee other Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>It were certainly well if Phy&s;icians could govern the Patients by Rea&s;on, and
<PB N="7" REF="6">that of their own &s;tock, as well as give 'em Medicines of their own preparing, without putting 'em in fear of large Fees, or dear Phy&s;ick; then no doubt they would con&s;ult 'em &s;ooner.</P>
<P>And it were very well, if Phy&s;icians would not only prevent their own ruin, but their Patients al&s;o by their good &s;ucce&s;s; and that he that has the be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s might have mo&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, which can hardly be whil&s;t Phy&s;icians are D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pen|dants.</P>
<P>How Apothecaries &s;hould get any certain <HI>No&s;trum</HI>'s from Phy&s;icians Pre&s;cripts, I don't ea&s;ily &s;ee, &s;ince they have been &s;o Numerous, and compounded in almo&s;t every Ca&s;e, that the Phy&s;ician him&s;elf mu&s;t needs be ignorant what did the Cure: but if the Apothecary was &s;o &s;agacious as to &s;ee what wrought the Effect, how could he be &s;o dull as not to learn the manner of u&s;ing it?</P>
<P>Whether the Di&s;pen&s;ary will remove the peoples Complaints and Jealou&s;y, does not yet appear; or whether the Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctors, and their Apotheca|rys will be le&s;s combin'd, and more hone&s;t than others, or more for either the Phy&s;icians or Patient's advantage.</P>
<P>But, if the Apothecary can't complain that he is injur'd by the Di&s;pen&s;ary, which only follows his Example, in bringing the Advi&s;ing and Shop-trade to|gether, to the better &s;ervice of the Publick; certainly, the Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;ician can with as little rea&s;on complain of the Apothecary, for &s;etting him the Good Example, in better &s;erving the Publick: If the Apothecary was the fir&s;t Ambo-dexter that the Doctor thought worthy to imitate, why &s;hould he be &s;o angry at the Ma&s;ter that gave him &s;o fair a Copy? And if it be &s;o rea&s;onable in ca&s;es of Life and Death, to practi&s;e only the Judicial part, why may not the practi&s;ing Apothecary leave the making of Medicines only to his Man, whom he him&s;elf has in&s;tructed, as well as the Di&s;pen&s;ary-Phy&s;ician to his Apo|thecary at the College, who perhaps mu&s;t in&s;truct his Ma&s;ters?</P>
<P><Q>'But the Di&s;pen&s;ary (adds he) has been impeached with the Barbarous de&s;ign, of de&s;troying the Apothecarys Company. But they &s;corn the Impu|tation, and declare the greate&s;t E&s;teem of tho&s;e of the Society, who (like the Gentleman near the College) <HI>Moribus Antiquis,</HI> are as Eminent for their care in preparing the be&s;t Medicines, as for their integrity and mode&s;ty, in not invading the Profe&s;&s;ion, or abu&s;ing and de&s;troying the People.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the Di&s;pen&s;arys multiply, and the People believe they are the on|ly &s;ure relief to the &s;ick, the Apothecarys mu&s;t fall, unle&s;s tho&s;e few who like the Gentleman near the College, <HI>Antiqua Ignorantia,</HI> are the more to be tru&s;ted for good Medicines, becau&s;e they dare not pretend to under&s;tand the U&s;e of them.</P>
<P><Q>'But &s;ays he, The Apothecarys de&s;troy them&s;elves by their Numbers, mul|tiplying from 1000 to as many more in eight years, without any pro&s;pect of checking the &s;uperfluous increa&s;e; they mu&s;t therefore accu&s;e their own un|happy
<PB N="8" REF="7">Conduct, who are in&s;en&s;ible of its fatal Con&s;equences.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the Apothecaries are &s;o likely to be de&s;troyed <HI>Suis Copiis,</HI> what need of &s;o much noi&s;e at them? let them go quietly down: but unle&s;s they multiply more than other men, I don't &s;ee how their number can de&s;troy them any more, than the Multiplying of any State or Kingdom can de&s;troy it. But it is not barely the Multiplying, or de&s;truction of the Apothecarys, that troubles the Di&s;pen&s;ary, &s;o much as what follows.</P>
<Q><P>'That they avow with a&s;&s;urance, that they have or will take all the Practice of Phy&s;ick into their own hands, re&s;erving only 5 or 6 great Men, to take on them&s;elves the Odium of the Deaths of their Patients.'</P>
<P>'The Surgeons fare not better than the Faculty, they are re&s;erv'd for the difficult Ca&s;es, robb'd of the more Common, by which they only can ac|quire Skill and Dexterity for the more important.'</P>
<P>'The Poor are undone in every &s;ickne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>'</P>
<P>'The Di&s;pen&s;ary pretends to pre&s;erve tho&s;e who are more numerous than the Apothecarys, and it will be the <HI>Alma Mater</HI> to the Phy&s;icians, from the two Univer&s;itys, who will be capable to exerci&s;e the Learning they have ac|quired there.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This is the Grand fault of the Apothecaries, that they undertake to practi&s;e: Let them have been as great Knaves as they would, if they had never medled in any thing that had been to the Di&s;honour, or rather and more e&s;pe|cially to the Di&s;advantage of the Doctors (for now <HI>Plurimus auro venit Honos</HI>) they might have ruin'd them&s;elves without pity I do not que&s;tion: And tho&s;e Men that are content to take on them the Odium of the Deaths of the &s;lain among&s;t them, or to excu&s;e their own faults by the Apothecaries mi&s;takes, have the Honour of being well paid no doubt. Tho the Surgeons lo&s;e &s;ome of the &s;mall Jobs by the Apothecarys Officiou&s;ne&s;s, they do not &s;o much com|plain; but they fit them as well as the Di&s;pen&s;ary, commonly making their own Medicines, and if they lo&s;e the Ordinary Ca&s;es, yet they arc the more u&s;ed to the Difficult. But</P>
<P>The Poor &s;uffer mo&s;t truly in every Di&s;ea&s;e, Corporeal or Crumenal, whether Poor Doctors, Apothecarys, Surgeons or People; and Poor <HI>we</HI> are fir&s;t to be cared for, whatever the Pretence be of the Di&s;pen&s;ary's being the <HI>Alma Mater,</HI> where the Phy&s;icians from the two Univer&s;ities may exerci&s;e their Learn|ing with the Pe&s;tle, and beat out great matters in Pharmacy.</P>
<P><Q>'But the other Objection of the unob&s;erving People, who&s;e memory may not &s;erve 'em well, is that the Apothecarys &s;ell as cheap. It is granted if they will, but do they not by their own and the Doctors Artifices in dividing, &s;ell an Electuary of 12<HI>d</HI> in boles for 12 half Crowns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we will not quarrel at their 11 pence in the Shilling profit, but would o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ly prevent the return of it 40 t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">mes in 24 hours, when the Patients advantage the lea&s;t part of the De&s;ign.'</Q></P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The People don't remember (we doubt) that the Doctors told them they &s;ell cheaper than the Apothecarys; 'tis granted they may if they will: but by the conjoint Artifices of the Doctors yet their Confederates, in divi|ding they enhance the price of an Electuary from 12 pence to 12 Shillings; but they could never have done it, if they had not &s;ound their advantage by the Doctors frequent <HI>Repetatur's,</HI> tho I hardly believe every half hour, <HI>tertia vel quarta quaque hora</HI> being commonly the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>But the la&s;t and vile&s;t Objection is, <Q>'That the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;ary are not as Eminent as the Phy&s;icians, the Apothecaries Favorites: 'Tis own'd they can make famous or infamous by a few Cabals and Vi&s;its; but is there any part of Phy&s;ick, even Poetry, which the&s;e Gentlemen can't pretend to as well as the other, who di&s;tru&s;t their own merit by courting their favour, putting them&s;elves in their &s;ervice, and plying them, as Porters a Shop of the Large&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s?'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Eminence of Phy&s;icians now adays, does not indeed re&s;ult from real Worth or Accompli&s;hment, but may ari&s;e from the Report of Men, that talk even like the Apothecaries. But the Di&s;pen&s;ary, and the other Phy&s;i|cians (I believe) are indifferently the &s;ame, &s;ome wi&s;e and &s;ome otherwi&s;e: but that Poetry &s;hould be counted a part of Phy&s;ick, and with a <HI>even,</HI> as if it were the <HI>Culmen Artis,</HI> would have been a &s;trange fancy till of late. I think Mr. <HI>Colebatch,</HI> and his Antagoni&s;t (however their <HI>Acids</HI> and <HI>Alkalies</HI> &s;tood affected) agreed in this, that tho Poetry is a very pretty accompli&s;hment, yet a Poet and a Phy&s;ician are va&s;tly different. <HI>Letter to a Gentleman concern|ing Alkaly and Acid.</HI></P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that to get Bu&s;ine&s;s is a valuable part of Phy|&s;ick; and to have written a Poem has not long &s;ince for &s;ome time com|mended &s;ome late Doctors more than all their Cures, and other fine Qualifica|tions.</P>

<P>'The Di&s;pen&s;ary Practice will &s;oon demon&s;trate that the Remedy to this per|nicious Practice can be only had from it &s;elf, &s;ecure from this inhumane art of growing Rich, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>'</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> There are &s;everal things very ob&s;ervable in this &s;ecret and ab&s;iru&s;e De&s;ign.</P>

<ITEM>6. That great Numbers are kill'd by Phy&s;ick, which would have recover'd without any.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That the Remedy of this pernicious Practice can be had only from the Di&s;|pen&s;ary. In the&s;e particulars, we have more couch'd than at fir&s;t one would be readily aware of, and the Oracle that gave this ab&s;tru&s;e account hath &s;hew'd an uncommon &s;agacity, which will never permit me to think there are not Men of great parts in the Di&s;pen&s;ary.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Grand de&s;ign of the&s;e Sophi is to get tho&s;e Patients that will recover by the &s;trength of Nature, or who&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es will terminate by a Cri&s;is with|out Phy&s;ick, that is, all the common and mo&s;t numerous Di&s;orders, with the acute Di&s;ea&s;es, which is certainly the mo&s;t advantageous Practice: And doing nothing but a &s;mall matter, for a Colour of Merit, that people may not think they give Fees for nothing, will not quickly expend the Drugs, and Medicines in the Repo&s;itory; but a &s;mall Stock will carry on the Shop-trade, tho they &s;hould &s;ell as cheap as they pretend: but this is not all, there is commonly more cre|dit got by curing tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es that need no cure, or will terminate &s;oon by the efforts of Nature; for when the Patient is well, the Di&s;ea&s;e was this or that grievous Malady: one or two proper Directions, that is, what will do neither good nor hurt, mu&s;t be given to &s;atisfy the Patients and their Friends, or el&s;e the Fees will hardly &s;atisfy the Doctor. Tho it is the Opinion of one of the Company, that a Phy&s;ician in many ca&s;es, e&s;pecially in the Small pox,
<PB N="11" REF="10">de&s;erves his Fees better for directing nothing, than for doing &s;o (&s;ee Dialogue between <HI>Alkaly</HI> and <HI>Acid, pag.</HI> 71.) But I cannot conceive, why the Di&s;pen|&s;ary practice of doing nothing, &s;hould be the only Remedy for the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es; and why an Apothecary or other Phy&s;ician, may not cure by the &s;ame Method. But the People being afraid of Fees in &s;mall or common Di&s;ea&s;es, are apt to run to Apothecaries; &s;o the Doctors lo&s;e the mo&s;t ea&s;y, &s;peedy and advantage|ous Bu&s;ine&s;s: But Apothecaries being as willing to grow rich as any, make them pay dear for a Multitude of unnece&s;&s;ary and pernicious Medicines, and &s;o the People &s;uffer wherever they go.</P>
<P><HI>Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim,</HI> unle&s;s the Ble&s;&s;ing of Pover|ty prevent. <Q>'But they may expect (&s;ays he) this will be debated between the Phy&s;icians of the Apothecaries Party, and the Peoples; the one &s;ide re|lying on the Maxim, <HI>&s;i Populus vult decipi decipiatur,</HI> the other on the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of all Communities, <HI>Salus Populi &s;uprema Lex.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the College of Phy&s;icians are divided, we may expect the Hou&s;e cannot &s;tand; but I think it is no ju&s;t cen&s;ure, that the Phy&s;icians that are not of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, are of the Apothecaries Party, in oppo&s;ition to the good of the People; for I know &s;ome that have le&s;s to do with the Apothe|caries than the Di&s;pen&s;ary, who are only become Apothecaries them&s;elves, or confederate with &s;ome Apothecaries of their own: nor does it appear that the Welfare of the People, and not their own advantage, is the only thing they aim at, or is more &s;ought by them than by divers others.</P>
<P><Q>'When it &s;hall become &s;en&s;ible (adds he) how the Publick is impo&s;ed on in the expence in Sickne&s;s, and in Life it &s;elf, the Laws which now puni&s;h Offenders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will at la&s;t interpo&s;e the Cure of more latent and enormous Crimes. The Faculty will have the Protection it demands, after the Per|formance of the &s;tipulated Conditions; the Di&s;pen&s;ary will have the publick regard, or ob&s;erve its Enemies puni&s;hed with Fines more than the 100 Marks, or the other more &s;evere, the lo&s;s of Life, from Medicines in the ex|orbitant Quantities as de&s;tructive as Poi&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> Here the Di&s;pen&s;ary is very uppi&s;h, and threatens its Enemies with Fines, and Death; which I confe&s;s will be a greater Argument again&s;t their Enemies, than any they have yet given.</P>
<P>But what they mean by lo&s;s of Life from Medicines in exorbitant Quantities, as de&s;tructive as Poi&s;on, I do not know, unle&s;s they de&s;ign to get an Act that whoever will not regard the Di&s;pen&s;ary &s;hall be poi&s;oned by large Do&s;es of Phy&s;ick: but the Legi&s;lators ought to be very well &s;atisfied, in the &s;tipu|lated Conditions, that they be not only publi&s;hed, but that they be performed e're they make Laws again&s;t either the People, or all other Phy&s;icians.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>BUT we come now to the Merchants Letter, where fir&s;t he informs us, <Q>'that he had a Fever, which was cured by the Di&s;pen&s;ary Method of giv|ing but &s;ew Medicines, and tho&s;e &s;eldom given.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This I confe&s;s is a good Method, if the Medicines are good; but there may certainly be a Fault as well in giving too little as too much: and I believe many Medicines prove ineffectual on this very account, and the right Method does not lie in giving little or much, but ju&s;t enough, which a Man may judg of without being of the Di&s;pen&s;ary. <Q>'But this Caution gave him greater Confidence in the Art, with the A&s;&s;urance he had of the Medicines being faithfully prepared and di&s;pen&s;ed at the College.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> What A&s;&s;urance the Merchant was capable of receiving, that the Medicines are faithfully prepared and di&s;pen&s;ed at the College, I know not; but I do not &s;ee what the People can have to &s;atisfy them, more than their Words, which other Apothecaries al&s;o are ready to give, tho it be but a &s;mall Proof.</P>
<Q><P>'But when the Doctor allowed him to &s;it up and receive his Friends, they gave him an account (&s;ays he) of the new Revolution in Phy&s;ick, and ge|nerous De&s;ign of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, which they were extremely &s;atisfied with. They told him, this Conte&s;t between the hone&s;t Phy&s;icians of the Di&s;pen&s;ary (thus it &s;eems they are di&s;tingui&s;hed, tho the Word hath lately lo&s;t its value) and the Apothecaries &s;upported by their Confederates the Anti-College Phy|&s;icians, was as much the common Di&s;cour&s;e as the Difference between the two Companies, or the great Factions which divide the Nation. But,'</P>
<P>''Twas not ea&s;y for them to find out the Rea&s;on and Pretence of this Con|trover&s;y; but they who had been advi&s;ed by the Di&s;pen&s;ary, and u&s;ed their Medicines, could more ea&s;ily di&s;cover the true Cau&s;es of the Separation, than the Citizens, who yet lie under great Errors and Prejudices in this Af|fair: And the Ca&s;e according to the Opinion of the whole Company is ac|cording to the&s;e following Particulars.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This whole Company of Vi&s;itants no doubt were all Merchants concerned, and advi&s;ed by the Di&s;pen&s;ary (tho &s;ome &s;ort of Patients) and not ignorant Citizens, or el&s;e they would not have had &s;o great Satisfaction in the Genero&s;ity of the Di&s;pen&s;ary De&s;ign, and have &s;een &s;o much into the Cau&s;es of their Quarrel with other Phy&s;icians and Apothecaries. But, I never heard
<PB N="13" REF="12">&s;o much I confe&s;s of their Factions as of tho&s;e that divide the Nation, or that the Di&s;pen&s;ary Men are the only hone&s;t Phy&s;icians: and tho they a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Name of Hone&s;t in oppo&s;ition, and di&s;tinction from all o|ther Doctors and Apothecaries; yet I think they cannot be very proud of it, &s;ince the Word <HI>hone&s;t</HI> hath lately lo&s;t its value as they confe&s;s, and &s;o their Ho|ne&s;ty is of no great account.</P>
<P>But that the Apothecaries are &s;upported by the Anti-College Phy&s;icians, I believe is a &s;lip of the Pen; it &s;hould have been Anti-Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;icians, for none u&s;e Apothecaries &s;o much as tho&s;e of the College.</P>
<P>But let us hear the Particulars.</P>
<P><Q>'The hone&s;t Phy&s;ician is obliged by the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the Pati|ent, and his Intere&s;t in the Succe&s;s, to take care that the Medicines are effec|tual, and faithfully di&s;pen&s;ed: if the In&s;truments are not good, the effect of the Advice is lo&s;t; by a mi&s;take in weight or mea&s;ure, the Life of the Patient is de&s;troyed.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> What the Merchant &s;ays here is certainly very true, but the Di&s;|pen&s;ary Phy&s;ician cannot with any Mode&s;ty a&s;&s;ert him&s;elf the only hone&s;t Phy&s;ician, if the word be took in its u&s;ual Sen&s;e; and others are as much ob|liged in Con&s;cience and Intere&s;t as he; and I have known an hone&s;t Apotheca|ry faithfully di&s;pen&s;e an effectual Medicine according to the reputed hone&s;t Doctor's Pre&s;cript, to the de&s;truction of the Patient; who had he known the Ca&s;e, would never have done according to the Doctor's Order, nor have let the deadly mi&s;take in the Do&s;e, which was merely the Doctor's, have its ef|fect.</P>
<P><Q>'But the Apothecary (adds he) neglects his Duty to the Phy&s;ician and the Sick; is rarely in his Shop, prepares few Medicines, but buys them under great uncertainties; tru&s;ts raw Apprentices to &s;elect the Ingredients, and mea&s;ure the Proportion in the Pre&s;cript.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This cannot ju&s;tly be &s;aid of the Apothecaries in general, &s;ome of them are as hone&s;t as any in the Di&s;pen&s;ary no doubt, and not guilty of the&s;e Crimes. But,</P>
<P><Q>'The People, he &s;ays further, who are not acquainted with the Di&s;pen&s;a|ry, of two Evils chu&s;e the lea&s;t as they think, by u&s;ing the Apothecaries, believe they &s;ave the Doctors Fees; tho the Medicines brought in in little Parcels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ri&s;e to a greater Sum 3 in 4 in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, than both Advice and Phy&s;ick in mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This I believe is too often true, but ought not to be a univer&s;al Charge; and it has been too often found that the Doctor has taken more for Fees than was nece&s;&s;ary for Phy&s;ick and Advice too. But &s;ays he,</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P><Q>'The A&s;&s;ociate part of the College, &s;eeling the Apothecarys power in Fami|lies, readily come in, or are forc'd to &s;erve under 'em, on condition they for|ward the increa&s;e of the Bill, and rai&s;e their Ability to advi&s;e, to an equal pitch with their own: by both which the Apothecaries intere&s;t is more confirm'd and improv'd.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This is a very great Scandal to the greate&s;t part of the College, none being excepted but the Di&s;pen&s;ary; but they have one commendation the&s;e o|thers want, <HI>viz.</HI> that they rai&s;e the Ability of the Apothecarys to advi&s;e e|qual with their own, which &s;hews they are not &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as others; and if the Apothecary be as able to advi&s;e, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why he &s;hould not: And by this the Peoples intere&s;t will be confirm'd and improv'd as well as the Apotheca|ries.</P>
<P>But he continues, <Q>'The De&s;ign is therefore to revive the former Practice of Phy&s;ick, particularly that of <HI>Lower</HI> and <HI>Sydenham,</HI> who had greater &s;ucce&s;s with fewer Remedies than now are forc'd upon the People: or rather to expo&s;e the Method the Phy&s;icians and Apothecaries u&s;e to them&s;elves and Friends, of avoiding carefully the Exce&s;s by which innocent things become de&s;truc|tive.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Practice of <HI>Lower</HI> and <HI>Sydenham</HI> can't well be call'd the former Practice, nor is the methed of Practice &s;o much altered &s;ince their time, nor could I ever hear of their extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s above other Phy&s;icians; I believe they us'd but few Medicines, for to do them ju&s;tice they knew not many, having none of the profounde&s;t skill in Pharmacy: But having great Names, perhaps in &s;ome ca&s;es great Expectations might alter the Patients, with a very &s;mall matter be&s;ide. But if the De&s;ign be to expo&s;e the Method Phy&s;icians and Apothecaries u&s;e to them&s;elves and Friends, of carefully avoiding the Exce&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is a Commendation, and they will be willing to be expos'd, whether Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctors, Apothecaries or others. He adds,</P>
<P><Q>'But the Di&s;pen&s;ary de&s;igns to convince the People by their experience, that the mo&s;t u&s;eful and effectual Remedies are of no great Price.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> But then it mu&s;t be taken for granted, that they have the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful and effectual Remedies, which we know they have not; tho they offer to &s;ale their <HI>Arcana</HI>'s in their Bill lately di&s;pers'd. Nor will I grant that the mo&s;t u&s;eful and effectual Remedies are of &s;mall value, or ought to be &s;old for a mean Price, unle&s;s the Fee makes amends.</P>
<P>He goes on &s;aying, <Q>'The Publick will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible that the Expence in almo&s;t all Di&s;ea&s;es <HI>per Diem</HI> will be of <HI>one, two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> Shillings, in&s;tead of &s;o many Pounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that their Di&s;tempers will &s;ooner yield to a few well prepar'd College-Medicines, than to the decay'd, vicious, and adulterate of the Shops; and the Phy&s;icians Reward and Remedies too come far &s;hort of the Total of a long Bill.'</Q></P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It is a hard matter to &s;ay what the daily Expence of all Di&s;ea&s;es will be; but it is the u&s;ual Method of Traders to pretend to under&s;ell one a|nother, to get cu&s;tom; but they propo&s;e Advantage by it: and we mu&s;t under|&s;tand this rate is to the Poor. But how any will be a&s;&s;ur'd Di&s;ea&s;es will yield to College-Medicines &s;ooner than to others, or that they will be well prepar'd, I know not, or how they can &s;ay &s;hop-Medicines are decay'd, vicious, and adul|terate, yet tho&s;e in the College-Shops will never be &s;o.</P>
<P>But &s;ays he, <Q>'The Di&s;pen&s;ary can't fail of univer&s;al Approbation, when the People reflect that they have in many Ca&s;es u&s;ed the Method they recommend, preparing in their Hou&s;es the white Decoction, Infu&s;ions of Rubarb and Senna, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or u&s;ing the common Cordial Waters, Spirits, and Tinctures bought of the Druggi&s;t, Chymi&s;t, or Whole&s;ale &s;hops.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Di&s;pen&s;ary (or Merchant for 'em) now a&s;&s;ures it &s;elf, and that infallibly, of a univer&s;al Approbation, when once the People reflect that they han't only imitated the Apothecaries keeping Shops and &s;elling Medicines, but u&s;ed even the peoples Method (which mu&s;t needs be good) in preparing the <HI>white Decoction, Infu&s;ion of Senna;</HI> Grand Remedies, and wi&s;ely prepared no doubt! but <HI>Cordial Waters, Spirits and Tinctures</HI> bought of the Druggi&s;t, Chymi&s;t, or Whole&s;ale &s;hops, they cry down in the Apothecary, but imi|tate in the People.</P>
<P><Q>'But when its U&s;e (he &s;ays further) &s;hall become more publick, their ge|nerous Charity and regard to Mankind will be loudly applauded; and the Advantages from it to this City allow'd to be greater than all the Royal mu|nificent Ho&s;pitals in <HI>Europe.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark. Ingens Gloria calcar habet,</HI> I &s;ee; but Charity and Philanthropy u&s;ually begin at home, and where it appears it ought to be applauded.</P>
<P>That the Di&s;pen&s;ary may po&s;&s;ibly be of more Advantage to the City than all the Ho&s;pitals in <HI>Europe</HI> except its own, I readily believe; but whether it will be any to it, or them&s;elves, is yet doubtful.</P>
<P><Q>'This is the &s;hort view (&s;ays he) I could take of the pre&s;ent and future State of Phy&s;ick (obvious to every one that will confider his own intere&s;t, or not be very unwilling to be inform'd) but becau&s;e it is an affair of the greate&s;t Concern of our Life, your Friends oblige me to con&s;ult you, and report to 'em your Opinion of the grievous Di&s;temper, and the mo&s;t probable methods of curing it, with an unanimous Re&s;olution to &s;upport and encourage a De&s;ign, by which all Conditions of Men are equally obliged.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This is the view which that Merchant and his Friends could take; but how this pre&s;ent and future State of Phy&s;ick is &s;o obvious, and in relation to the Di&s;pen&s;ary an affair of the greate&s;t importance, I don't &s;ee. Well, but the Merchant is oblig'd to con&s;ult the Phy&s;ician, with a promi&s;e of the unanimous Re|&s;olution
<PB N="16" REF="15">of the Merchants to &s;upport and encourage the De&s;ign: but I am afraid &s;ince the Merchants have been lately found guilty, and puni&s;hed for promoting De&s;igns, they will not be &s;o free or able for the future to oblige all Conditions of Men.</P>
<P>But, we come to the Di&s;mal Account which the Merchant received from the Phy&s;ician of the Barbarous treatment of the Sick, &s;o far as his Memo|ry would &s;erve him.</P>
<P><Q>'That we are impos'd on more than any other Nation in all the Arts that relate to Life and Health.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> We are like to be impos'd on &s;till, if &s;ome other Method be not e&s;ta|bli&s;hed than that the Di&s;pen&s;ary propo&s;es, being no way a&s;&s;ur'd we &s;hall not be impos'd on by them.</P>
<P><Q>'That the common and mo&s;t u&s;eful Remedies are put upon the People at a Rate, in mo&s;t fifty times, in many one hundred times more than their intrin|&s;ick value.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The common Remedies are not the mo&s;t u&s;eful, nor are the mo&s;t u&s;eful put upon the People; but the intrin&s;ick value of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Reme|dies are not known to the Di&s;pen&s;ary, they being ignorant of them.</P>
<P><Q>'That the exorbitant Expence ruins the Poor, and deters them and the Rich from a ju&s;t care of their Health, to avoid oppre&s;&s;ive Treatment, &s;ub&s;e|quent Di&s;ea&s;es.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> Exorbitant Expence, if the Poor can expend it, will ruin 'em no doubt; but I &s;hould think the Fear of it &s;hould not deter 'em or the Rich from, but fright 'em to a ju&s;t Care of their Health: yet if the ju&s;t Care of Health be to fee a Doctor, or go to an Apothecary, I am apt to think either of them will be &s;omewhat chargeable.</P>
<P><Q>'To hide the&s;e Exactions from the People, the Apothecaries allow none to practi&s;e with 'em but who betray their Profe&s;&s;ion, countenance a va&s;t quantity of Phy&s;ick de&s;tructive, and &s;upport exorbitant Rates in the Bills: Phy|&s;icians are brought into all Families by them, and writing well is the Lan|guage for writing very long Pre&s;criptions.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> That &s;ome of the Apothecaries are guilty of &s;ome of the&s;e practi|ces I don't que&s;tion, but I think they charge too General; indeed, I have heard the term of Writing Well thus interpreted, and have heard that 2 or 3 A|pothecaries have engaged with a young Phy&s;ician to cry him upon condition he would thus write well: but &s;uch things ought to be di&s;cover'd, who and when, and puni&s;h'd.</P>
<P><Q>'The E&s;teem of the Profe&s;&s;ion is &s;unk by the Scandal of all the Deaths in the Town thrown on Phy&s;icians, who are rarely con&s;ulted but when the Ca&s;e is made de&s;perate by the Apothecaries, and the Patient takes the Progno&s;tick
<PB N="17" REF="16">of Death from the Change of Advice, and is deprived of that a&s;&s;urance which is the greate&s;t &s;upport in Sickne&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The E&s;teem of tho&s;e that profe&s;s to &s;ave Lives mu&s;t needs &s;ink where they are thought to do nothing, or to kill; and wherever the Work lies be|tween two, one will blame the other. I have heard the Apothecary &s;ay, &s;uch a one died <HI>Secundum Artem;</HI> and the Dr. is not always wanting to blame (or at lea&s;t in&s;inuate a Fault in) the Apothecary: but the Rea&s;on why per&s;ons &s;o rarely con&s;ult the Phy&s;icians is their own fault, becau&s;e they will not proportion their Fees to the Capacities of the Patients, or more commonly advi&s;e freely. Fox a Patient to be afrighted with Death, in &s;ome ca&s;es is very prejudicial, in &s;ome beneficial: a well grounded A&s;&s;urance much promotes &s;ome Cures, and the Con|fidence of an ignorant Phy&s;ician many times does more than his Pre&s;cripts, or even than tho&s;e of the more knowing.</P>
<P><Q>'That the Study of Art is neglected, becau&s;e the Di&s;ea&s;es are by ill treatment forc'd into unnatural Symptoms, and differ from all tho&s;e your Authors treat of: there are in the Books of Phy&s;ick no ca&s;es manag'd by an Apothecary by almo&s;t one common random Method; your Writers have been careful in this to conceal the infamy of the People and your Profe&s;&s;ion.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> A true account of Ca&s;es duly manag'd, no doubt is of great u&s;e and benefit to Students in Phy&s;ick, but I believe there are but few &s;uch Au|thors.</P>
<P>But, he that can't judg of a Di&s;ea&s;e by what he &s;ees in the Patient, has not made any great proficiency in natural Knowledg; and it is a &s;hame that Phy|&s;icians &s;hould confe&s;s the Study of Art is neglected, tho there were no Books; it was at fir&s;t practis'd without any &s;uch helps. But it had been well, if the late Writers had been careful to di&s;cover the ill Practice of tho&s;e People of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, tho to their infamy, that we might know what would not &s;ucceed, and what Rocks and Shelves to avoid, and not chu&s;e to make up their Ob&s;ervations on|ly with Ca&s;es more creditable.</P>
<P>But he goes on, <Q>'It is now ten years &s;ince a Committee of the hone&s;t Part of the College expo&s;ed the&s;e Grievances to the Lord Mayor and Court of Al|dermen, and had convinc'd 'em of the nece&s;&s;ity of removing the oppre&s;&s;ion the Publick had long felt; and it was concluded the Phy&s;icians &s;hould rate the Price of Medicines in their Pre&s;criptions. This was haughtily rejected by the Company at a Meeting in their Hall &s;ome Months after; a &s;mall Number of the Younger Apothecaries offering to comply, were compel'd with threats to retract their promi&s;es. The Committee of the Aldermen and Commons (the Apothecaries flying from that as nece&s;&s;ary as rea&s;onable Propo&s;al) de&s;ir'd that the College would provide a Repo&s;itory of Medicines, which will and may have, and may ju&s;tly claim (af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">r twenty thou&s;and Bills made up there) their Regard and Protection.'</Q></P>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> By the hone&s;t Part of the College we mu&s;t under&s;tand, the 46 Di&s;|pen&s;ary Doctor-Apothecaries; but how the re&s;t will take it, to be without di|&s;tinction counted the Di&s;hone&s;t part of the College, we may ea&s;ily judg. It is now no new thing for &s;ome Phy&s;icians to cry down all others, even in their Morals, that they them&s;elves may be better thought on: But how even that hone&s;t part of the College could hone&s;tly pretend to rate the Medicines they &s;hould have pre&s;cribed, I don't know, when they neither know the Co&s;t nor Art of the Preparations; be&s;ides, unle&s;s it were the hone&s;t part of the College, they might oblige the Apothecaries as well in rating as in pre&s;cribing. Now the Apothecarys might well reject this Propo&s;al, that a parcel of Men that did not under&s;tand Trade (being not then turn'd Merchants) &s;hould rate their Goods; and certainly tho&s;e that were willing to comply, mu&s;t be very young, to &s;uppo&s;e this Propo&s;al either rea&s;onable, nece&s;&s;ary or po&s;&s;ible; but the Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctors having &s;o very much bu&s;ine&s;s need not be di&s;contented, or &s;o earne&s;tly crave pro|tection; 20000 Bills one with another might well ari&s;e to 2000<HI>l.</HI> and the Fees make, more than that Sum neat profit, which would protect them &s;ufficiently from the attacks of 1000 Cli&s;terpipe Men.</P>
<P>But he &s;ays further, <Q>'The Laws of the la&s;t Age &s;aw and provided again&s;t the&s;e vile Abu&s;es; but our Laws are &s;ubject to the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;es as our &s;elves, are fallen into the infirmity of old Age, and to be regardle&s;s of others concerns.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the Laws are di&s;ea&s;ed, 'twill be well if the Di&s;pen&s;ary can prepare powerful Remedies to cure them; but old Age I doubt will be beyond their cure, even in them&s;elves, tho they regard only their own concerns.</P>
<P><Q>'You allow'd (adds he) the Faculty could not want the Art of relieving it &s;elf, but one Party turns its force again&s;t another, like a vitious Compo&s;ition of Ingredients of oppo&s;ite Qualities has no virtue to &s;ubdue the Epidemick Malignity.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> I grant the Faculty has always &s;tudied the Art of relieving it &s;elf, and &s;o have the Company; and becau&s;e the&s;e have been mo&s;t expert in it, the Faculty complains: But the Faculty indeed is a vitious Compo&s;ition, who&s;e ma|lignity lies upon the People, it was never well compounded; even the Di&s;pen|&s;ary Ingredients are not without vice, nor will the Fermentation among them amend (I doubt) but rather exalt the Malignity, or the People ever be free from vile abu&s;es till there be a new and better Pre&s;cript. He further adds,</P>
<P><Q>'The great increa&s;e of Apothecaries is evidently the cau&s;e of all the pre&s;ent Grievances to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick, to them&s;elves and the People. They are become 1000, ten to one Phy&s;ician; the regulated Citys abroad allow no more than can make up the Phy&s;icians Directions one to ten. The Con|&s;equence of &s;o great a Number can't be avoided, 900 can't po&s;&s;ibly keep good
<PB N="19" REF="18">Medicines in their Shops; mo&s;t of the Compo&s;itions, and mo&s;t of the Sim|ples often mov'd in little quantities, are &s;ubject to evaporate their mo&s;t active Parts, to corrupt and become vapid and &s;our, or rotten and &s;tinking. Who will believe the &s;imple Waters, Tinctures, Spirits, Pouders of volatil parts, Syrups, Electuaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> can wait and keep well, till they have their turn to be us'd, when the Shops are as numerous as the &s;ick? they mu&s;t be thrown away and &s;upply'd anew, if the Cu&s;tomer can't be impos'd upon, but that will be &s;ooner than a new Preparation.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It now appears that it is the number of Apothecarys that mo&s;t grieves the hone&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ick, and their own grief is fir&s;t felt; the Apothecaries being a great many, get a great deal of the ea&s;ie&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, which the Profe&s;&s;ion would have otherwi&s;e had: but if they are ten to one Phy&s;ician, the College are not all Phy&s;icians; and if they were but one to ten, I believe they could not make up the Phy&s;icians Pre&s;criptions, which are commonly large enough. But the number of Apothecaries is not the chief cau&s;e that they can't keep good Remedies, but that the learned Doctors have given them &s;uch a large and ill|compil'd Farrago of Medicines, that they will not keep good. They mu&s;t have a great Catalogue of &s;imple Waters, which &s;ignify nothing but to mix things as a Vehicle, many of which can be made but once a Year, and won't keep a Month without being corrupted, when Dr. <HI>Bates</HI>'s <HI>Hydropeg.</HI> or common Spring or di&s;till'd Water is as good; likewi&s;e of Syrups, many of which are al&s;o made but once a Year, and are apt to ferment, grow four, or be fill'd with Flies, and which is wor&s;e, are good for nothing but to clog the Stomach of &s;ick People. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the numerous Cla&s;&s;es of Con&s;erves, and Electuaries made up with Sugar and Honey. Pouders are of very different Natures, &s;ome incorruptible, others &s;oon &s;poil'd, and others never good: but Tinctures and Spirits may be kept long enough unchangeable, tho ever &s;o vola|til; and if they lo&s;e any thing of &s;trength, a little larger Do&s;e will do.</P>
<P>But a Di&s;pen&s;atory might ea&s;ily be made of fewer and more effectual Reme|dies not ea&s;ily corruptible, were Phy&s;icians or Apothecaries well skill'd in the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> and <HI>Pharmacy;</HI> but until they are, were there ever &s;o few Apo|thecaries, the &s;ick will be abu&s;ed, while they are obliged to keep fooli&s;h things that one Doctor in 10 or a 100, or in the whole Town perhaps, has a fancy to u&s;e now and then.</P>
<Q><P>'But the numbers of the Apothecaries (&s;ays he) like Hawkers are always vi&s;iting the Families, and recommend the taking Trade in ea&s;ie&s;t ca&s;es; in others they quicken the u&s;e of Boles, and Draughts. They are rarely &s;een in their bu&s;ine&s;s of the Shop: The Pre&s;cript of the Doctor and Apothecary him|&s;elf is left to be made up by the raw heedle&s;s Boy, that has not the Di&s;cretion of his Ma&s;ter; who&s;e utmo&s;t care is required, when the Patients Life is lo&s;t by almo&s;t every Mi&s;take.'</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P>'The vomitive, corro&s;ive, chymical Liquors or Pouders, may be taken in|&s;tead of the Cordials of the &s;ame Colours: Can the Boy bring his Mind to a &s;teadine&s;s, to number his Drops of <HI>Laudanum,</HI> or violent Acids, to weigh half a grain of <HI>Opium, Elaterium,</HI> or judg the Patient mu&s;t die by the Apo|zem, boiled after this or that Decoction, or that a Copper Ve&s;&s;el &s;hall make the Preparation poi&s;onous?'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remmark.</HI> The number of Apothecaries will not much alter the Ca&s;e, if the Numbers of Doctors and other People encrea&s;ed alike; but if they would hauk only for the Doctors, we &s;hould not have the Numbers complained of; and if they were &s;ewer, they would tru&s;t as much to Boys or &s;ome other Servants having more Bu&s;ine&s;s: but being many, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s divided among them, they may the better attend them&s;elves. Many Faults are no doubt committed by Boys, in mi&s;taking things and their Do&s;es, and &s;ometimes in not being able to read or under&s;tand the Doctor's bad Hand or Latin, or correct his Mi&s;|takes as to the Do&s;e, or things pre&s;cribed together, or the Nature of the Me|dicine, which &s;ome Ma&s;ters have done e're now, and thereby &s;aved the Life of the Patient, of which In&s;tances might be given. But &s;ays he,</P>
<P><Q>'The hone&s;t Apothecaries al&s;o complain and lament the Difficulties, which by the exorbitant Numbers are brought on the People and them&s;elves; that their Medicines cannot be vented while good and fit for u&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It &s;eems there are &s;ome hone&s;t Apothecaries then, even in the O|pinion of the Di&s;pen&s;ary-Doctors, and no doubt they are alike hone&s;t to them&s;elves, and wi&s;h there were fewer of the Company, that they might have better Trade; and if they were as factious as the College, they might de&s;troy one another, and the great ones devour the little ones. The &s;poiling of their Me|dicines is from their extravagant Numbers and undurable Qualities (as before &s;aid) not the Number of their Makers.</P>
<P>He adds, <Q>'that they and their Servants are ba&s;ely u&s;ed as Porters, to fetch and carry Boles and Gla&s;&s;es, and have not lei&s;ure in their Shops to prepare and compound any thing, but buy abroad.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> They are Porters to the Doctors then, and why not to the hone&s;te&s;t, who ought to &s;end their Bills to them to encourage their Hone&s;ty, and not take the Trade out of their Hands, by &s;etting up Shops of their own? But if they have not lei&s;ure for all their Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is a &s;ign they have too much trade. But further, <Q>'They are forced to advi&s;e again&s;t their Con&s;cience, commanded by the Nur&s;es and People to own them&s;elves as skilful as other Apothecaries (who undertake any thing) that they may not forfeit their Bu&s;ine&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The&s;e hone&s;t Apothecaries it &s;eems are the lea&s;t skilful, or el&s;e it could not go again&s;t their Con&s;ciences to own them&s;elves as wi&s;e as others. But it is pity, they &s;hould be &s;o forced into Bu&s;ine&s;s by their Cu&s;tomers Com|mands,
<PB N="21" REF="20">the hone&s;t Doctors would willingly take it off their hone&s;t Hands. A gain,</P>
<P><Q>'That to live them&s;elves, they mu&s;t endanger the Life of their Cu&s;tomer; give more than they would u&s;e them&s;elves in the &s;ame Ca&s;e. They reflect with Horror at fir&s;t, that they violate the Laws of their Country; &s;ubject to Fines, adjudged Felons, if they mi&s;take the Virtue or Do&s;e of the Medicines; obliged to &s;et exorbitant Prices to the Poor and Servants, that the Wealthy may not di&s;cern the Difference: they are in the &s;ad Condition of the <HI>French</HI> King, in the ab&s;urd De&s;cription in King <HI>Arthur,</HI> who was wont to make his Meals on the raw Limbs of his poor Subjects.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This is a &s;ad Character of the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Apothecarys, that they are &s;uch Sinners again&s;t their own Con&s;ciences. I cannot under&s;tand how they came to be in &s;o much Favour with the Di&s;pen&s;ary, as to be &s;till termed Ho|ne&s;t, unle&s;s it be for fetching or carrying, or for their Ignorance, whereby it is &s;uppo&s;ed they will be capable of doing their Duty, or rather the Doctors le&s;s hurt in Practice: Or is it likene&s;s-&s;ake? But to add to their Crimes, they wan|tonly devour the People alive, which if it be true, it is a Sign their Con&s;ciences are not much concerned; and what are the re&s;t if the hone&s;t are &s;o bad? Yet I can hardly believe, any ever made this Confe&s;&s;ion. But further they &s;ay (if we may believe the Merchant)</P>
<P><Q>'That the odd Confu&s;ion of their Bu&s;ine&s;s perplexes them, to be one Hour wiping the bli&s;tered Part, and clapping on Melilot, then giving a Cly&s;ter; next con&s;idering what to advi&s;e in a malignant Fever, then in the Convul&s;i|ons of a Child. The la&s;t mu&s;t be done by the ba&s;e&s;t Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;teal|ing off the File, this or that Phy&s;ician's Bill they imagine to hit the Ca&s;e, and &s;ave him the Trouble of &s;eeing the Patient.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> Still more Commendations of the hone&s;t Apothecaries, &s;ure the&s;e are &s;ome near the College, perfidious in &s;tealing Bills off the Files; no, I be|lieve the Crime lies in &s;aving the Doctor the Trouble, I would &s;ay Profit, of &s;eeing the Patient: but why he mu&s;t &s;teal a Bill for a convul&s;ive Child rather than any other Ca&s;e, I don't under&s;tand, unle&s;s this Merchant's Talent lies in cu|ring Convul&s;ions. But if the Confu&s;ion of the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o perplexes them, why have the Doctors &s;o perplexed it? why have they never called for the Surgeons, or Butchers to take off the Skins of the Patients, and &s;upply them with Melilot, and &s;ome fitter Per&s;ons to admini&s;ter behind? But if the&s;e things are &s;o great, and perplexing a Confu&s;ion, why does the Di&s;pen&s;ary undertake the &s;ame?</P>
<P><Q>'But 'tis obvious (he goes on) the prodigious Number of Apothecaries will in a few Years naturally increa&s;e to more than twice as many, and &s;o on; will oblige them to increa&s;e the greater vent of Phy&s;ick, and higher Prices; they
<PB N="22" REF="21">will not be wanting in perpetual Incroachments on the Faculty, they will be plying to rai&s;e and &s;upport their Intere&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they will a&s;&s;ume the cure of many thou&s;ands yearly that would have been &s;ooner well without Phy&s;ick; they will &s;truggle fir&s;t with their own Fraternity, then the Members of the College, except their Confederates; they will not bear or commend any Me|thod, but where Phy&s;ick is ordered every Hour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> 'Tis the Number of Apothecaries &s;ticks in this Trade&s;man's Sto|mach, more than their Hone&s;ty, he plainly &s;hews, not becau&s;e they will be &s;o ma|ny Porters and rai&s;e the Rates of Drugs, but becau&s;e they will encroach on the Faculty, and get the Credit of many Cures, which were done merely by not killing, by which &s;ome Doctors might have rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable Repu|tation.</P>
<P>But whether they will have the wit to learn of the Doctors, to &s;truggle with then own Fraternity, I que&s;tion, and of which this is meant, the hone&s;t Apo|thecaries or the others: but if they grow &s;o numerous, and the College take no Care to enter Auxiliaries, I fear they will be too hard for the College, both hone&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t too, if their Intere&s;t ingage them again&s;t all. But &s;till to inhance the Crimes of the (Hone&s;t) Apothecaries.<Q><P>They will not &s;uffer any Character of a Phy&s;ician to pa&s;s without an Allay or Antidote, who will not ju&s;tify his Practice, and all his Medicines with the Air and A&s;&s;urance of a Common Knight of the Po&s;t, and take the Death of the Patient on him&s;elf. Any Citizen who will think, may di&s;cern the Rea&s;on of the per|petual Di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the College: one Party would rai&s;e its Reputation by &s;erving the Publick faithfully, the other oppo&s;e all Projects of that kind to merit the Favour of the Apothecaries.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tates from their own Profe&s;&s;ion are not to be informed that the Dignity of the Faculty mu&s;t &s;ink, when they are forced to delude the People by applauding the unskilful or pernicious Treatment; and the Doctor for his Fee has the Reproaches of the Hou&s;e and Funeral, when he dares not inform them the Patient had the fatal Stroak already given him, that the mi&s;take of the Apprentice in &s;ub&s;tituting one thing for another, or a wrong Proportion was the true Cau&s;e of a violent not natural Death. When we rarely treat a Di&s;temper at its beginning, commonly the only time to interpo&s;e between Nature and the Di&s;ea&s;e to any purpo&s;e, are called to no purpo&s;e in the end, when all is in Confu&s;ion the Vigor of Nature &s;pent, or oppre&s;|&s;ed with as many Do&s;es as Hours in 8 or 10 Days, and chiefly imployed in worn out and vitiated Con&s;titutions.</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> All Apothecaries are certainly wicked Fellows, if the hone&s;t ones are &s;o bad, and the word Hone&s;t has indeed lo&s;t its value; but they do but imitate the Doctors, who will not give them a good Character, unle&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="22">they will comply with their Intere&s;t. But it is a great Scandal to the College that they &s;uffer &s;uch Members among&s;t them, that have no more Faith or Ho|nour thin Knights of the Po&s;t; that will ju&s;tify what they dont know, <HI>viz.</HI> the Apothecaries Medicines and Hone&s;ty: and the Doctors are imprudent too as well as wicked, or el&s;e they never would take the Deaths of the Patients on them&s;elves, or the Cure of them they know pa&s;t cure. But it is not &s;o obvious to the Citizens, that the Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctors are all &s;uch as would rai&s;e their Reputation only by faithfully &s;erving the Publick; and that all the re&s;t oppo&s;e all &s;uch De&s;igns to get the Favour of the Apothecaries; that they are all ba&s;e Apo&s;tates from their Profe&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now I think it would &s;hew but little Ho|ne&s;ty in a Phy&s;ician after his Patient's Death, to tell the Patient's Friends he was killed, or incurable before he undertook him, or that the Medicines were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> good, and that the Boy mi&s;took, when of &s;uch things (tho they too of|ten happen) the Doctor is commonly ignorant. But when this hone&s;t Mer|chant was well enough to go abroad, he tells us,</P>
<P><Q>'That he was recommending the Advantages of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, and the Integrity of the Phy&s;icians Sub&s;cribers, but was &s;urprized to hear many expre&s;s a Prejudice again&s;t it, without de&s;iring to know the De&s;ign of it; a notable Company about a Tea-table had been exclaiming, and &s;aid, theyd go the old way till it came more in fa&s;hion, &s;ince they did not know how many had been killed by the Apothecaries, they were ea&s;y not to find out new Occa&s;ions of Trouble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The&s;e were Merchants no doubt of the old Company, that were contented to trade upon the old Foundation, they had &s;ettled their Heads by a Di&s;h or two of Tea, and were willing to &s;ee others make out their Preten&s;ions. They were not willing to accu&s;e the Apothecaries of Murder, unle&s;s they could prove it, le&s;t they &s;hould bring them&s;elves into Trouble. But,</P>
<P><Q>'In other Vi&s;its, he was <HI>&s;tartled</HI> at the many &s;candalous Reports again&s;t the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;ary. The fir&s;t, &s;ays he, they contemned as ma|licious and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Impo&s;tures; they, had too much <HI>Poetry</HI> in them for Truth. The other appeared ridiculou&s;ly little, and very ea&s;ily refuted. That their Phy&s;ick is as dear as the Apothecaries, when we experience the Difference of 18 or 19 in 20 Shillings, their Goodne&s;s ju&s;tified by the Sub|&s;cribers Care in the Choice of every Drug, which they buy at the highe&s;t Prices; their Reputation an&s;werable for every defect. That they have not Servants &s;ufficient, when they can increa&s;e their Number; and the want of Hands &s;uppo&s;es the growing Bu&s;ine&s;s equal to defray the charge of more. But if the Sub&s;cribers want the Univer&s;ity Education or Capacity for their Employment, they may con&s;ult the Apothecaries Li&s;t of the College, and find better if they can. If they de&s;troy all the Patients, and the Apotheca|ries
<PB N="24" REF="23">and their Confederates never want Succe&s;s, the want of Advocates will prevent the Trial, and non&s;uit the Debate. If the Remedies are not good, the abu&s;ed People will &s;ea&s;onably complain; if they have no Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Di&s;pen&s;ary will have none, and will be but a Collection of Pots and Gla&s;&s;es, and the Servants &s;ufficient to &s;hew the u&s;ele&s;s Repo&s;itory.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Merchant in his further Adventures, meets with <HI>&s;tartling Reperts</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;ary, no doubt he is concerned in &s;upplying them with Drugs. I could wi&s;h he had given us the Poetical ones, they might have been a Diver&s;ion, if not by their Wit, yet by their Folly; but what is the matter? Poe|try is &s;o contemptible now, which before he boa&s;ted of in the Di&s;pen&s;ary as a Qualification with an Empha&s;is, <HI>even Poetry,</HI> to bring up the Rear in tho&s;e that commend or belong to a Phy&s;ician; now Poetical and Fal&s;e go together. But he &s;hould have confuted the&s;e great and harder Objections, as well as he has the little ones, to which he has an&s;wered very well, if the Merchant can a|vouch what he has &s;aid, that they will always &s;ell at the rate &s;et down, which I am &s;ure will be le&s;s than they co&s;t.</P>
<P>That the Di&s;pen&s;ary always employ tho&s;e that have Skill, Mr. <HI>Acid,</HI> or &s;ome other Apothecary-Doctors among them to buy the Drugs, and not tru&s;t their Boys. That they will confe&s;s every defect: That their growing Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall not perplex them, as it does the Apothecaries. That their Members, whether they came from the Shop, or the Schools, have Univer&s;ity Learning, and as much Capacity for Phy&s;icians as they pretend to. That they will not de&s;troy &s;o many Patients as Apothecaries and other Doctors. But above all, that the Patients will be &s;en&s;ible of the Abu&s;es in Phy&s;ick, and always complain when abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But he tells us further.</P>
<P><Q>'That the People will in a little time apprehend, that their Intere&s;t as to Health and Expence is the Subject of the Controver&s;y, and that every one is both Judg and Party, and can give a definitive Sentence as far as he is con|cerned. And here is no Law to be enacted by Majority of Voices, or re|&s;traint to be put on the Liberty of any particular Per&s;on; he need not ex|pre&s;s a childi&s;h Dread, as if he were to be kidnapt away.'</Q></P>
<P>To be plain, I am afraid the People will not &s;oon experience that their Health and Expence, but their Expences, is the Subject of the Controver&s;y; but we know every one is not capable of being a Judg, or &s;o unhappy as to be a Party. The People do not &s;ee the Depths of Satan in the&s;e things, and whence the fair Invitations proceed.</P>

<P>'But the Doctors re&s;tore the antient and cautious Practice, by providing ef|factual Remedies, and preventing deadly Mi&s;takes.'</P>
<P>'The Apothecary leaves his concern to the whole&s;ale Trade and his Boy, is always abroad giving Advice. Can any two things be more alike in Ap|pearance? Can they be ju&s;tly di&s;plea&s;ed with you, who give your Care and Countenance to the trade of making Medicines, as the Apothecary in return puts a value upon yours, in plea&s;ing him&s;elf with the Practice of Phy&s;ick?'</P>
<P>'They reply, they are forced to it by the Peoples Importunity; &s;o you are to &s;end your Pre&s;criptions to the College, by tho&s;e who like a good Medi|cine at the intrin&s;ick value: they are afraid the Di&s;pen&s;ary will ruin the Apo|thecaries Trade, who are every day indu&s;triou&s;ly de&s;troying your Profe&s;&s;ion. You are invaded with va&s;t Numbers like a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army, who &s;lay without Quarter, re&s;erving a few Slaves to be cut off, if they bear not their Chains ea&s;ily, or &s;cruple any work they are put upon.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Apothecaries are gracele&s;s Fellows, they don't u&s;e the Deco|rum they ought in comparing the Doctors to them&s;elves, and do not hand&s;om|ly di&s;tingui&s;h between Doctor- Apothecaries and Apothecary-Doctors; but it is certain, they both not only act after the like Method, but for the &s;ame Ends endeavour to plea&s;e the People; and if the Doctor-Apothecaries re&s;tore the antient Practice, they do but imitate the Apothecary-Doctors, in taking care of the Preparation, as well as the Admini&s;tration of Medicines: but whe|ther either do enough to prevent all deadly mi&s;takes, is much to be que&s;tio|ned.</P>
<P>The Apothecary leaves his concern to his Boy, but is &s;eldom without the over&s;ight, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Man, who under&s;tands his Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as the Doctor's Man at the College, or St. <HI>Martins-Lane.</HI> The one may ve|ry well do one Matter's Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as the other &s;erves 46: And he him|&s;elf under&s;tands Pharmacy better than any of the 46 Doctors, not excepting him who was bred under the acute Ma&s;ter at <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> But it is pity, either of them are forced to &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s. If I could per&s;uade People to Tem|perance
<PB N="26" REF="25">and Sobriety, they &s;hould not &s;o complain of much Bu&s;ine&s;s forced upon them.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why the Apothecary-Doctors value the Doctor-Apothecaries Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>&amp; Vice ver&s;a,</HI> no doubt is, becau&s;e it is good to have two Strings to one Bow, or to have Cu&s;tomers come in at both Doors.</P>
<P>But the Doctor-Apothecaries &s;ell Medicines at the Intrin&s;ick Value, which the Apothecary-Doctors cannot afford: but if the Doctor-Apothecaries would al&s;o &s;ell Advice at the Intrin&s;ick Value, they would certainly ruin their Anta|goni&s;ts; they are alike Fi&s;hers, but with different Baits, one catches by a Pretence of Advice at the Intrin&s;ick Value, <HI>viz.</HI> little or nothing, but makes them pay &s;o much the more for the Medicines; the other the Medicines almo&s;t at Intrin&s;ick Value, <HI>viz.</HI> little or nothing, but expects his Gain in the Fees: and which Bait will take be&s;t being doubtful, they are between Hopes and Fear who&s;e endeavours will ruin the other. But the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army of the Apothe|caries makes the <HI>Swede</HI> tremble, yet encouraged by good Generals, they are not without hopes of Victory, and Re&s;olution never to be taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<Q><P>'But (in other Conver&s;ations he &s;ays) he had better Succe&s;s, he per&s;waded not a few to con&s;ult tho&s;e of the Society at the approach of the Spring, and has had their Thanks, with large accounts of the difference of the old and new Practice of Phy&s;ick. So many Converts in my Neighbourhood brought on me the Re&s;entments of my former Apothecary.'</P>
<P>'He expo&s;tulated to me the ill Con&s;equence to their Trade, with bitter and envenomed Reflections on the Di&s;pen&s;ary, and the Promoters of it. You &s;hall judg from his manner of arguing, We govern all the Families; they believe us in every thing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When the Men are abroad, or not in the Sick-Chamber, we recommend whom we plea&s;e, and decry the oppo&s;ite Party: Do you believe we will &s;pare any of them? and ha&s;tily plucked out a &s;canda|lous Li&s;t printed at the de&s;ire of the Ma&s;ter and Wardens, where our hone&s;t Phy&s;icians are di&s;tingui&s;hed by Marks from their Hone&s;t Slaves; which being promi&s;cuous in the College Order, he blundred thrice, and &s;hewed for Vil|lains tho&s;e of their own Confederacy. But after &s;ome time he recovered, and told me, they were re&s;olved to maintain the Reputation of what they had done many Years, &s;ince there have not been more than 5 Phy&s;icians rai&s;ed but by &s;erving us; We call them topping Phy&s;icians, becau&s;e we put them on the People as we plea&s;e. There are of &s;everal Sortments and different Abilities, who pa&s;s by our Artifices for the greate&s;t Men: Has not one ri&s;en con&s;idera|bly by our Favour, who has employed much of his time in writing 3 Folio Poems, exploded by his Brother Poets and Phy&s;icians for the vile&s;t Bomba&s;t, every Expre&s;&s;ion relating to Phy&s;ick or Philo&s;ophy proved to be trifling, ab|&s;urd and fal&s;e, and judged &s;o even by us? Do not &s;everal of the College come
<PB N="27" REF="26">over, and betray all that pa&s;&s;es? The re&s;t are afraid, and dare not be hone&s;t and ju&s;t to their Patients. Will we pardon him who cures a Fever for one or two Pounds, when our Friends will rai&s;e the Bill to 10, 20, or 40 Pounds? He that brings in the Fidler, will make him play what Tunes, and as oft as he plea&s;es. Does the Di&s;pen&s;ary pretend to impo&s;e on the Publick, that we are not u&s;eful out of our Shops; who give Cly&s;ters, dre&s;s Bly&s;ters, and bleed when it is ea&s;y? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I would not farther concern my &s;elf, but only put him in mind, that one Sex was accommodated without them, and the other was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Surgeon, who attends to the&s;e and the greater Ca&s;es of Surgery abroad, without impediment to any part of his Profe&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, Bli&s;ters often in|flam'd or corroded, to evacuate more freely, require more than the common treatment. I had been made &s;en&s;ible how that excellent and mo&s;t u&s;eful Art of Surgery was invaded by the&s;e bold pretenders to every thing they do not under&s;tand; they bleed, without &s;u&s;pecting the Nerve or Artery may lie in the way. They apply to Inflammations and Tumors, and keep in the putrid mat|ter, till the &s;inuous Fi&s;tula or rotten Bone gives pain loud enough to call for the Surgeon.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> This Merchant I perceive was Broker to the Company, or Spoke&s;man to per&s;wade the People to buy the Doctors Remedies, and had got, as he &s;ays, many promi&s;es to con&s;ult them at the time when People are per&s;waded they ought to take Phy&s;ick whether they need it or no, which is certainly ea&s;y Practice; and no doubt the People had cau&s;e to thank him for advi&s;ing them to tho&s;e that would give the lea&s;t: People that are well had certainly better pay for Advice to go to &s;h&mdash;t when they have need, than for the directing a Purge or two; and they mu&s;t needs find a difference in the Practice, that being ea&s;ier than this.</P>
<P>No wonder the Apothecary, like a covetous dependant Preacher, is angry at him that converts his Flock into another Fold, and he has verily a great capacity to decry or recommend, as the Share of the Fleece engages him; but tho he of all Men may be&s;t know the Hone&s;ty and Capacity of a Phy&s;ician, yet I readily believe he is not always infallible, but may mi&s;take the Marks (being but &s;mall) of hone&s;t Phy&s;icians, and may readily take &s;ome of any Confederacy for Villains: but if there have not been more than five Villains rais'd by the Apothecaries, they are not &s;o bad as I could have believed them, yet they are much to be blam'd for putting any villains o top on the People, or repre&s;enting little fellows for great Men, but e&s;pecially for recommending the care of the Lives of the &s;ober People to <HI>Poets,</HI> who&s;e bomba&s;t fictions will never cure any con&s;iderable Di&s;ea&s;es, whether <HI>Arthurs,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;aries,</HI> or <HI>John Junior</HI>'s, who tho the Qualifications may recommend them all to the filly Peo|ple (who love Conceits) for ingenious Men, yet Criticks will let neither go
<PB N="28" REF="27">without Cen&s;ure, but &s;oon di&s;cover where the Mu&s;e was up too &s;oon, and fell into &s;ome <HI>Supine Nod</HI> or other: or <HI>when his Spirits &s;tagnate like a Flood;</HI> or when <HI>he blazons in dread &s;miles his hideous Form,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the College are &s;ure a wretched &s;ort of Men, that &s;ome betray the re&s;t, and the re&s;t dare not be hone&s;t and ju&s;t; and the Apothecaries are very unmer|ciful, that they will not pardon him that cures a Fever at 1 or 2 Pounds, they might have &s;aid Guineas, when I know the mo&s;t Fevers may be cur'd at half the Rate, and the Doctor be a Gainer: and I believe were there nothing but the Mu&s;ick it &s;elf to recommend the&s;e Arti&s;ts, there would but &s;ew dance e|ven to the Di&s;pen&s;ary Cly&s;ter-Pipe, who I don't que&s;tion have their u&s;eful Men in their concern, not only to give Cly&s;ters, dre&s;s Bli&s;ter, and bleed when it is ea&s;y, but al&s;o to accommodate even the one Sex when they have a mind to a Jigg. I am glad to hear the Merchant &s;peaks honourably of the Surgeons, and with &s;ome concern for their intere&s;t; and grant that they may mind bu&s;ine&s;s abroad without impediment to bu&s;ine&s;s at home: It is certainly as much the Surgeons concern to take care of the Pharmaceutick part as it is the Di&s;pen&s;aries, &s;ince they cannot tru&s;t the Apothecaries. I am pleas'd that they are &s;en&s;ible the Surgeons are invaded by the Apothecaries as well as them|&s;elves, it &s;hews they are grown better natur'd &s;ince they them&s;elves per&s;ecuted that Party for interloping: but the huge Ru&s;&s;ian Army of the Apothecarys makes them willing to &s;peak the Poles fair, and not pretend to turn Dr. Surge|ons too, as well as Dr. Apothecaries; If they had, I &s;hould have blam'd them for &s;uppo&s;ing the Nerves and Arteries lie between the Veins and the Skin, or that there is any need of cutting through both &s;ides of the Vein, or that Tumors are fi&s;tu|lous before they are open, or that rotten Bones, or purulent Tumors are mo&s;t painful.</P>
<P><Q>'But after various fortune abroad (&s;ays he) I was to meet a &s;elect Compa|ny of Merchants and other eminent Citizens. I determin'd to ask their A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Coun&s;el: I &s;how'd them your Papers, and laid before them the Informations relating to the College, and our own Intere&s;t: &s;ome were di&s;cour|&s;ing of Treaties abroad, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but at mine and our Friend's reque&s;t we came to debate of our own immediate concern. I was de&s;ired to give you a further trouble, to remove the common <HI>Opprobrium</HI> on the Profe&s;&s;ion, that it wants Certainty, and acts often by conjecture&punc; and that more &s;candalous, that the A|pothecarys &s;eeing the Patient and you at the bed &s;ide, is able to give Phy&s;ick him&s;elf. And (after our a&s;&s;ertion or the Cheapne&s;s of the be&s;t Medicines, and &s;ome conte&s;ts about it) that you would, as in our Papers for &s;ale by the Candle, give a pretty near e&s;timate of the Value of every Preparation, and Compo&s;ition or Simple now us'd in Phy&s;ick. We mu&s;t wait for this Account, on which the whole Controver&s;y depends; but the Company would not doubt of
<PB N="29" REF="28">the ea&s;y prices of the mo&s;t effectual Remedies (as are fit for the U&s;e of the Prince, now the regard of all <HI>Europe</HI>) many of us having us'd of &s;everal Kinds, of which the Do&s;e was of no great Value.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The&s;e were all &s;elect Merchants of this new Company (we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e) becau&s;e their Coun&s;el and A&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and Intere&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But this Gentleman and his Friends were mo&s;t diligent, they were for home Treaties, <HI>de laribus &amp; focis;</HI> but that trouble the Gentleman gave 'em, I believe will indeed be found one, 'ere the <HI>Opprobria</HI> of the Profe&s;&s;ion are removed. That it is uncertain and conjectural in great part, is mo&s;t certain, and granted by all knowing and mode&s;t Phy&s;icians; but it's certainly a&s;&s;erted by none &s;o much as the Ignorant, and tho&s;e that are willing to deceive the People. I don't &s;ee how it &s;hould be thought the greater Scandal, that the Apothecaries by &s;eeing the Patient and Docto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s at the bed&s;ide can become able to give Phy&s;ick; for were it &s;o, it would argue the Arti&s;t certain, and the Art ea&s;y: and that all that have to do with the Sick &s;hould be able to give Phy&s;ick, would certainly not only be a credit to the Profe&s;&s;ion, but &s;afe to the Patient; for one may recti|fy anothers mi&s;takes. But I believe here lies the &s;candal, that the Apothecary being skilful &s;ometimes is forc'd to di&s;cover the Doctor's defects in Care, in Prog|no&s;ticks, or in Pharmacy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In which la&s;t I think they have di&s;covered ig|norance enough, and that they have not the be&s;t Medicines, their <HI>Pharmacopeia</HI> being their &s;tandard, which is one of the wor&s;t Collections in the World. But it is plea&s;ant that they talk of &s;elling their Medicines by inch of Candle. And I believe we may wait a great while, 'ere the&s;e Merchants will give us an e&s;timate of the value of every Preparation, Compo&s;ition and Simple us'd in Phy|&s;ick; it will be &s;o laborious and difficult a work, they will not have time to pre|&s;cribe. If the whole Controver&s;y depends upon this, it will never be at an end: but the Company have been us'd &s;o kindly in many things, they don't doubt of ea&s;y prices.</P>
<P>If they are not kind to tho&s;e that are to carry on the Trade, it would be &s;trange. But that nothing but &s;uch cheap Phy&s;ick &s;hould be fit for his Maje&s;ty, looks as if they thought him poor, or not to de&s;erve the more precious Remedies, or at lea&s;t would have him furni&s;ht out of their &s;tock. But he goes on,</P>
<P><Q>'After their lamenting the Poor, and the vile treatments of others, they re|&s;olved they would make their Acquaintance &s;en&s;ible of the generous De&s;ign of the College, and engage them to the mo&s;t indu&s;trious publication of its U&s;e, the only <HI>Panacea</HI> to the Sick; they would not doubt to convince the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate and heedle&s;s Oppo&s;ers.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the&s;e Gentlemen had not made &s;o great a noi&s;e about the Poor, and &s;hewn &s;uch great indu&s;try in inviting to buy their <HI>Panaceas,</HI> one might have
<PB N="30" REF="29">believed &s;omething of their Genero&s;ity. But Mankind now adays are not &s;o immoderately de&s;irous to &s;erve one another, much le&s;s tho&s;e that have mo&s;t need; we cannot but in charity think the&s;e Merchants are mo&s;t willing to re|lieve their own Poor, who are not &s;o hard to be convinc'd of any thing that may tend to their benefit. But,</P>
<P><Q>'He goes on to tell us what the Apothecary mu&s;t do, he mu&s;t be obliged to keep his Shop, that all his Medicines may be made at home, and di&s;pens'd with his own hand, or under his careful in&s;pection, that his Apprentice may be imployed to learn his Trade, and be taken from the giddy ambition of ap|ing a Profe&s;&s;ion a little too far removed from his. That our Servants &s;hall be &s;ent for the Phy&s;ick, and Directions &s;hall be left at our Hou&s;es by the proper Hands; each of us &s;ending our Porters, the hurry and confu&s;ion may be ta|ken off the Apothecaries and then Servants, by which many Patients Phy&s;ick be|ing convey'd at one time, the deadly accidents that often happen may be avoid|ed. Our Me&s;&s;enger will find the Shop &s;edately forwarding their Affair, eve|ry one will wait the Mixture for his Ma&s;ter, by which the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Mi&s;take will be prevented.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It is very hard that the Apothecary &s;hould be oblig'd to keep his Shop, &s;ince the Doctor is re&s;olvd to &s;end all his Bills to the Di&s;pen&s;ary, and to under&s;ell him in Medicines. I know no way the Apothecary can take, but to under&s;ell the Doctor in Advice, and he may tru&s;t his Man to make up his Reci|pe's as well as the Doctor can his at the Di&s;pen&s;ary, the Ca&s;e being the &s;ame. The Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick, which the Apothecarys Boy is &s;o ambitious t~o ape, I agree has been too far removed from Pharmacy; and the Doctors do well in aping the Boy that would bring them together, which ought not to be &s;eparate. But Porters, tho they may carry greater burdens of Phy&s;ick at once, are not the fitte&s;t Me&s;&s;engers to convey the remedies to the Sick; he that makes up a Bill, may &s;ometimes &s;ave a Li&s;e by &s;eeing the Patient. I have known one lo&s;t 'ere now, which had the Apothecary's Boy &s;een, the Patient would have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e things were done, he further adds: <Q><P>The College will be &s;afe from the temptations they now lie under, and from being in &s;o large Numbers debaucht from their Virtue and indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to their Patients; and as the pre&s;ent 1000 (<HI>viz.</HI> Apothecaries) have two or three Apprentices each, which multiplying in proportion mu&s;t rai&s;e the Prices of Phy&s;ick, and the Quantity, and Indu&s;try of giving more, to the Ruin of their Credit with the People, there is no other method to pre&s;erve them&s;elves. The Families will then make choice of a Phy&s;ician from the vi&s;ible Succe&s;s of his Art; and not with the greate&s;t &s;tupidne&s;s ask the Apothecary to bring one, &s;ince from your Members you are forc'd to make the greate&s;t profit of every Patient,
<PB N="31" REF="30">which inclines him to a Phy&s;ician mo&s;t u&s;eful in that Ca&s;e. 'Twas re&s;olv'd after youre an&s;wer of the Prices, to oblige the Phy&s;ician to rate the Pre&s;cript &s;ent to the Apothecary at the faire&s;t Profit, to be paid at furthe&s;t after the reco|very; and to prevent the &s;ipping of Cordials, and Pearl Juleps, as U&s;que|baugh at the Coffeehou&s;es, upon every little humour of taking, encouraged by the mean and vile cu&s;toms of going upon tick till Chri&s;tmas.</P>
<P>A Mode&s;t Gentleman gave his a&s;&s;ent with &s;ome doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, but he would propo&s;e the&s;e things to the be&s;t Advantage.</P></Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> 'Tis a thou&s;and pities the College have &s;o many temptations to debauch them from their duty to their Patients. But it &s;eems the Apotheca|ries, as bad as they are, have been the happy occa&s;ion of reforming the hone&s;t part, by &s;etting them an example of pre&s;cribing their own Remedies; and 'tis but ju&s;t the Doctors &s;hould have a little Concern le&s;t their increa&s;e in Numbers &s;hould ruin them. But yet the Doctors are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Debauchery of the Apothecaries as well as of their own, that they dare not tru&s;t them with the recommendation of a Phy&s;ician, le&s;t they &s;hould not recommend one of the hone&s;t part who would &s;end the Bills to the College. The vi&s;ible Succe&s;s of his Art is certainly the be&s;t Character whereby one may choo&s;e a Phy&s;ician; but if this were the only rule, none would have ever been cho&s;e, for no Man has &s;ucce&s;s either in Curing or Killing till he has had &s;ome experience, which all our Doctors at fir&s;t can't but want. Nor can the Apothecary be &s;ure who he &s;hall have the be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s with till he has tried him, unle&s;s he had preingag'd the young Doctor to pre&s;cribe largely, on condition he will cry him up, which is a Practice I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have heard of. But how the new Company will enable or oblige the Old, and all Interlopers, to rate the Pre&s;cripts, I can't &s;ee, or how they can pretend to it, with better rea&s;on than the Apothecary might rate the Doctors Fees. But if they could oblige the Patients to pay ready money, and leave the vile Cu&s;tom of going upon tick, not only the Apothecary but hone&s;t part of the Doctors would be oblig'd; yet if it were to be only at the recovery, none of the Merchants I believe would keep open &s;hop long. How they will be able to prevent the People from &s;ipping other Cordials or U&s;quebaugh when they have a mind to it, or the Apothecary from &s;elling of it, a mode&s;t Gentleman may well doubt. But he gives us &s;omething con&s;iderable as &s;ol|lows.</P>
<Q><P>'Another who &s;ees thro the Town, demanded what hope there may be of repelling the Confidence of the Men of the Bottle, Wit and Banter, which ad|mire only the childi&s;h wantonne&s;s of Thought, and pretty deviations from good Sen&s;e, and therefore character the Men of their parts and dre&s;s into the publick E&s;teem. They were left to their fortune, and experience of others more di&s;cerning: the Signature ought to be taken from other Affairs of equal concern and importance.'</P>

We &s;hall know who &s;hall merit our Gratitude and Applau&s;e, and put down the infamous Cu&s;tom of accu&s;ing the Phy&s;ician; a Practice too vile to be expo&s;ed, to impute the Misfortune to the hone&s;t Indu&s;try of the Phy&s;ician, not con|&s;ulted till the Extremity, after many days do&s;ing by our &s;elves and Vi&s;itants; the Apothecaries not allowing a fair inque&s;t of Di&s;&s;ection, which would di&s;|cover the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Heart &s;topt, the Ulcers and Gangrenes of the Vi&s;cera.

The skilfulle&s;t Pilot, and mo&s;t grave and learned Judg is certainly to be tru&s;ted with the Ship and Cau&s;e: And the manner of the Doctor's weigh|ing the Ca&s;e, whether with Wit or none, is to be con&s;idered by tho&s;e that have Wit enough to do it, and how induced by Apothecaries, Vi&s;itants, or whether by the Brokers to the old or new Company; which done, it will be better gue&s;|&s;ed, who is likely to merit applau&s;e; and he that does indeed do &s;o, will mo&s;t put down the Infamy Phy&s;icians have &s;o often merited. But,</P>
<P>How to keep People from do&s;ing them&s;elves, and &s;o making work for the Doctors, I do not know, as long as there are &s;o many Medicines expo&s;ed to &s;ale.

Shall we look on unconcerned, when the Faculty and our &s;elves are en&s;laved, and oppre&s;t by the Number of the Apothecaries, originally their Servants? What is the My&s;tery, but a Mechanick and handicraft Trade? They act no|thing but by the Ordinance and Direction of the Phy&s;ician; the Medicines are all from their Appointment, the Drugs poudered, boiled, di&s;tilled, and mixed by their Order; What Books or Languages are under&s;tood by them, but the Di&s;pen&s;atory, or Receit Book? The Cook, Confectioner, and Perfumer have as much pretence to Learning, or the Knowledg of the U&s;es of what they prepare. Have not our Servants the Skill to make up our Dome&s;tick Re|ceits, many of them the &s;ame as theirs? The Under-Servant to the Chy|mi&s;t's Laboratory, while he clean&s;es the Gla&s;&s;es, attends the Fires, &s;peedily di&s;cerns the Mechanick Part; tho the De&s;ign and Proce&s;s were given by the incomparable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> or the Faculty, and the U&s;es only known to the &s;a|gacious Phy&s;ician. We plea&s;ed our &s;elves at parting, with the great Repu|tation, that worthy Gentlemen had given to our Country, with the learned of all Nations, which will la&s;t with the late Di&s;covery of the Circulati|on.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The whole Company of the&s;e Merchants without doubt were re|lated to the Faculty, or they had not been &s;o warm in the Concern: But this Gentleman had been long mu&s;ing, and he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to add a little heat at la&s;t, it being the only Opportunity to rai&s;e the &s;inking Reputation of tho&s;e, who have &s;o long profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful, as well as learned Profe&s;&s;ions; but I find the chief Cau&s;e of his heat was, the in&s;epa|rablene&s;s of their common Intere&s;t, which I the rather believe, becau&s;e he a|grees with the re&s;t, that it is the number of the Apothecaries that is mo&s;t dan|gerous, and not the Hone&s;ty of tho&s;e ra&s;cally Mechanicks formerly their Ser|vants; <HI>Davus perturbat omnia.</HI> But I mu&s;t beg the Doctor's Pardon a little: the pre&s;ent Venders of Medicines were not Doctors Servants, tho that was the Original of the Trade; but tho&s;e Doctors, who&s;e Servants turned Apotheca|ries, were a &s;ort of Men who very well under&s;tood Pharmacy, which the pre|&s;ent Di&s;pen&s;ers did not till a few broken Apothecaries came to be Doctors a|mong them. But the old Blades thought handy works no Di&s;grace: <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> the proude&s;t of them thought the highe&s;t Title he could bear, was that of <HI>Mo|narch of Mechanical Arcanas.</HI> If the pre&s;ent Apothecaries do nothing but by the Ordinance and direction of the Phy&s;ician, why do they complain? but perhaps it is not the hone&s;t Phy&s;ician's Orders they act by: I am &s;ure it is not the Orders of the skilful they obey in their Receit Book; if they had, there would not have been &s;o many in&s;ignificant and fooli&s;h Medicines there, and &s;o
<PB N="34" REF="33">few good ones, nor the <HI>&s;ecundum Artem</HI> wholly left to tho&s;e ignorant Me|chanicks, in which there often lies more than in the Receit it &s;elf. But as to Language, I will engage to bring Apothecaries that under&s;tand more, even <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than &s;ome of the Learned Doctors of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, be&s;ides other liberal Sciences. Many of them, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are ignorant enough both in Language, and Cookery; but what &s;hall be &s;aid of the Cook, Confec|tioner, or Perfumer, that knows not the u&s;es of what he prepares, or of the Wit that can &s;uppo&s;e them &s;uch ignorant Arti&s;ts? Nor I believe would the Gentleman e&s;teem the Mechanick Part of Chymi&s;try &s;o very ea&s;y, if he un|der&s;tood it: for I mu&s;t tell him there is more Art even in making a Fire than he &s;eems to imagine; and the incomparable <HI>Mr. Boyle,</HI> had not he and his Operators too under&s;tood the Mechanick Part of &s;ome Proce&s;&s;es better than the Faculty, he would never have hid his De&s;ign in them, whatever the Faculty might by chance have &s;tumbled upon. But the Doctor proudly a&s;&s;uming to the Faculty the &s;ole Knowledg of the u&s;es of Medicines, thereby ungratefully denies it that excellent Per&s;on, for the plea&s;ure he created them in the Repu|tation be &s;ingly had given the Nation, by making it not wholly ignorant in ex|perimental Philo&s;ophy, the chief Ba&s;is of Medicine.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>SO much for the Merchant's Letter, or the Doctor in di&s;gui&s;e. We come now to the unmasked Phy&s;ician's An&s;wer. Let us &s;ee if we can find any thing more like the Product of a Pen u&s;ed to pre&s;cribe the be&s;t Medicines; and he an&s;wers the Drug&s;ter as follows.</P>
<P><Q>'Sir, I perceive you lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s on the la&s;t enquiry of the low Prices of Medicines, becau&s;e you ob&s;erve that the large Bills of the Apothe|cary are the be&s;t Argument with the People of his Ability to advi&s;e; and while they believe the Di&s;ea&s;e is treated very much by gue&s;s, they are not ve|ry &s;olicitous who throws the Dice for their Lives: but you rather make choice of one, who has made it his only Bu&s;ine&s;s, has &s;tudied, and practi&s;ed all the Artifices of making them run to his purpo&s;e, than any common Hand.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the large Bills of the Apothecaries are the be&s;t Argument with the People of the Apothecaries Ability to advi&s;e, I do not &s;ee how &s;o much &s;tre&s;s can be laid on the Doctors &s;elling a few Medicines at low Prices; that which argues the Ability of the Apothecary, &s;hould methinks al&s;o argue the Skill of the Doctor: but the Doctor here talks too much like an Apotheca|ry, or &s;omething el&s;e. It cannot be denied that both Doctors and Apotheca|ries
<PB N="35" REF="34">u&s;e their Medicines very much like <HI>Dice;</HI> but whether the Doctor or Apo|thecary has got more Artifices to make 'em run to his purpo&s;e, is not ea&s;y to &s;ay: I believe both have more than are good, he that pretends to &s;ell cheap does it to get more Cu&s;tomers; he that &s;ells dear, does it to get the more Money, and both have the &s;ame De&s;ign. But it is very true, there are &s;ome uncommon Game&s;ters.</P>
<P><Q>'Further (&s;ays he) you will not deny that every Art has the means to attain its End. This is obvious in Manufactures, which are made better or wor&s;e, according to the Skill of the Artificer. There are other Arts, who&s;e Sub|ject is peri&s;hable from Cau&s;es above the Power and Controul of the Art, which Events are not imputable to the Arti&s;t. Navigation will conduct a Ship to the Port, but Storms, Rocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may lo&s;e the Ship. The Husbandman and Gardiner act with pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, but extreme Rains, Drought and Bla&s;ts de&s;troy their hopes. The Phy&s;ician pretends to know with as much certainty how animal Life may be pre&s;erved, and by what means endangered, as they the Health and Growth of Vegetables. You may make an e&s;timat to what Proportion animal Life may be prolonged, by ob&s;erving that the Periods of the Lives of many Quadrupeds and Birds are &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;tinctly known.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Phy&s;ician could have been contented to have his Art thought as certain as others, and he might have per&s;uaded the Merchants that &s;o it is, if he had not unluckily dropped that mode&s;t Word <HI>pretends,</HI> which makes &s;ome think, it is indeed but a Pretence. But I hope he would not cunningly in&s;inuate, that the bare Suppo&s;ition of the Knowledg of the Periods of the Lives of Bea&s;ts and Birds, is the way to e&s;timate what Doctors can do. Let us hear what has been &s;uppo&s;ed in this matter.</P>

<P>But I hope he would not have the Merchants think, the new Di&s;pen&s;ary-Doc|tors can make Mens Lives as long as the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Periods. If they could &s;o do, they would be rare Fellows, but bitterly pe&s;tered with Practice. <Q><P>'But yet Man's (he &s;ays) is the longe&s;t Period, and from <HI>Galen</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation that of the <HI>Britains.</HI> If in Navigation, the Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t be moved by the Tide and Winds, and turned by the Rudder to a certain cour&s;e: The Pow|ers of the Body act as mechanically by the natural Nece&s;&s;ity in Health; &s;o in the Appearances of Di&s;ea&s;es, the Humours are by a natural tendency moved

<P><HI>Remark.</HI> Either the Doctor is mi&s;taken, or <HI>Virgil,</HI> a better Poet than any of them, whatever <HI>Galen</HI> is: but under all, the Doctor's Intent is to per&s;uade us, that Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;icians can prolong Life. That Phy&s;icians do &s;o truly define and de&s;cribe Di&s;ea&s;es, or have &s;uch certain Experiences of their Cures, I mu&s;t deny: Authors differ; if they did not, yet Men of great Bu&s;ine&s;s read but little, and remember le&s;s, and he's a very rare Fellow indeed, that has a Promptuary in his Noddle to &s;erve him on all Occa&s;ions; but whatever may have been done by former Phy&s;icians, ours are <HI>quot Homines tot Sententiae</HI> (except in &s;ome very common Ca&s;es) both in their Definitions, and Pre|&s;criptions for Di&s;ea&s;es, as any one will find that &s;hall con&s;ult divers Phy&s;icians &s;e|parately, and compare their Accounts of a Di&s;ea&s;e and Pre&s;criptions for it; one will &s;ay 'tis this, another that; one will pre&s;cribe one thing, another ano|ther. But he &s;ays farther,</P>
<P><Q>'You cannot doubt the efficacy of the In&s;truments in Phy&s;ick, when in many Ca&s;es the rich Cordials given improperly, or in large Quantities, act as Poi&s;ons, and then in a little longer time as vi&s;ibly de&s;troy; when the over do&s;ing Vinous, or other Spirits, fire and inflame the Blood and Spirits: Opi|ates &s;top the Motions, the Bark checks the ferment of a Fever, which cannot be cured but by Expul&s;ion of the Venom: the effects of Vomits, Purges, Diaphoreticks, are owned by the vulgar Experience. The late but &s;urer force of Labour, Temperance, Re&s;t, have been formerly owned in the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;es. They are now rejected as the mo&s;t nau&s;eous Phy&s;ick, and the mo&s;t difficult to be complied with: I need not acquaint you with the Mineral Waters, which are able to cool, and dilute, and purify the Blood, after it has been heated and corrupted by modi&s;h Living. Nature di&s;covers to the Phy&s;ician its &s;ure&s;t Methods of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t common Fevers, by Bleeding, Sweats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the more difficult, it gives Indications how it would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted or directed; at lea&s;t our Magazines of Ob&s;ervations can|not &s;ail to furni&s;h in all Ca&s;es parallel to them.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> That even Cordials may &s;o ea&s;ily act as Poi&s;ons, and de&s;troy, methinks is no inviting Argument of the efficacy of Medicines; nor can this appear but from the Errors of Phy&s;icians, who have found it &s;o, which is no
<PB N="37" REF="36">great Credit. Tho the effects of vulgar Medicines are known, the Time and Ca&s;e where &s;uch effects &s;hould be produced; is not &s;o well perceived. Labour, Temperance, and Re&s;t are certainly excellent Pre&s;ervatives, but in ma|ny Di&s;ea&s;es cannot be u&s;ed: When a Man cannot &s;o much as &s;it up, to pre|&s;cribe him Labour; when he is delirious, to order him to go to Re&s;t, would be very good Phy&s;ick, if he could take it; but it is indeed difficult to be complied with, barely by the Doctor's Order. It is not &s;o certain to the Mer|chants, whether, and when the Mineral Waters do good or hurt: It was the Judgment of Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> that they do more hurt than good, taking one time with another; and it &s;eems to be the Opinion of one of his Scholars, that all the real Benefit got by drinking the Waters, comes merely from the large Quantities of Water taken, and not by the Minerals wherewith they are impregnated and defiled; and he advi&s;es Per&s;ons rather to drink at &s;ome pure Spring. Letter to a Gentleman, of <HI>Alkaly</HI> and <HI>Acids, p. ult.</HI> But the Air, Com|pany, Diver&s;ion of tho&s;e Places, may add very much to the Health of the Per&s;ons, which is u&s;ed to be attributed &s;olely to the Waters; tho all this would not cure a Man, who&s;e Blood is corrupted. Nature's Indications are not al|ways ob&s;erved or under&s;tood by Phy&s;icians, or always followed; but the Mode Practice prevails above them all: And the Magazines of Ob&s;ervations are not always open, or re&s;orted to by Phy&s;icians; but while a Man is looking for a parallel Ca&s;e, the Patient is often dead. A Phy&s;ician ought to have a better Rule, than the running to his Study to know what to do, where he is not &s;ure to find a true Parallel; the Author might be mi&s;taken, and not give a true or faithful account: Authors are apt to be &s;omewhat guilty of the Crime of the <HI>petty Sorcerers,</HI> who make their virulent Medicines all <HI>Panaceas,</HI> if you will believe the Catalogues of Cures confidently affirmed in the Bills; when very likely the Di&s;ea&s;e never was wor&s;e, or &s;o bad as they make it, if the matter of Fact related had any Truth in it at all. He goes on:</P>
<P><Q>'But if the Patient is overheated, and &s;urfeited by too many Medicines; if the &s;alutary Loo&s;ene&s;s be &s;topped too &s;oon, the Humours fix by Opiates, or the Bark, it's imputable to the Advi&s;er, not to the Art, which has given the &s;tricte&s;t cautions on the like Conjunctures. It is not a reproach to the Art, if there are wanting Remedies equal to the Rage or Violence of &s;ome Di&s;|ea&s;es, which will not wait the effect, or are above the Force of any known Drug that can be brought to oppo&s;e them, any more than to the State&s;man, General, or Coun&s;ellor, when he cannot always warrant Succe&s;s. When after the &s;teady u&s;e of Liquors which give a briskne&s;s to, but inflame the Spirits, &s;pend the Strength of the Blood by heating it, give Life a plea&s;ant but quick|er Motion, the Liver and other Parts &s;hall be made &s;cirrous and abce&s;&s;ed, the <HI>Omentum</HI> rotten, the Fibers flaccid, &s;hall the Art be accu&s;ed, that can|not
<PB N="38" REF="37">keep the Machin a going where every Wheel is broken?'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the Art of Medicine were &s;o certain as the Doctor would per|&s;wade his hoped-for Patients, the Arti&s;t would not &s;o often overheat, yea or o|ver-cool, or &s;urfeit his Patients by &s;o many Medicines: It will certainly be the Advantage of every Arti&s;t to do his work with the fewe&s;t Tools, all the Cauti|ons that they give one another are hardly &s;ufficient, fixing of Humors is what a Chymi&s;t would be glad to &s;ee the Doctor perform. To &s;uppo&s;e there are Re|medies wanting to equal the Force of any Di&s;ea&s;e, is to reproach the Author of Nature as if he had not goodne&s;s enough to provide a Remedy for every evil, or as if his Goodne&s;s were not greater than all Evi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, and to excu&s;e the Arti&s;t who ought to be blam'd that he hath not found out &s;ufficient Remedies, but lazily leaves them unknown.</P>
<P>Some of the Doctors them&s;elves are &s;teady Drinkers, but I believe never a|ny of them were found with &s;cirrous Livers, rotten <HI>Omentums,</HI> or flaccid Fibers caus'd by the briskne&s;s of the Blood. But if all Arti&s;ts may be accus'd of de|fects, it &s;ignifies not much what the Art is &s;uppos'd; 'tis the Arti&s;t, the Patient mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by. He farther &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>'That the tendences and events of the Symptoms, and the I&s;&s;ue of the Di&s;|ea&s;e may be known, and a probable Progno&s;tick given, is own'd by the for|wardne&s;s of the common People to give their Opinions. How often have you believed the pre&s;umptuous Valuer of him&s;elf, who doubts every ones knowledg but his own; when he has a&s;&s;ur'd you, had he come &s;ooner the Patient had not died; that another would have expired the next Day, if his advice had been wanting? The Writers of Government prove the Maxims of State from the Axioms of Phy&s;ick, that one Part overnouri&s;ht, &s;tarves and enervates the others: That when every Part di&s;regards the Inte|re&s;t of the Whole, its Di&s;&s;olution is as certain, as when every Part is vitiated in a &s;hatter'd Con&s;titution.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Doctor would fain rai&s;e the Reputation of Phy&s;icians with the People, particularly the credit of the new Shopkeepers, but he does it by un|lucky Arguments; the forwardne&s;s of the common People to progno&s;ticate, or run to the Fortuneteller to know the Succe&s;s of their Amours, Law-&s;uits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is no very convincing Argument that their Oracle is not a Cheat: nor is their Faith in the pre&s;umptuous Valuer of him&s;elf, who &s;o po&s;itively decrees what would have, or not have been, if this, or that; any a&s;&s;urance that he is, or can be what he pretends. But I believe the Doctors may be certain enough in their Progno&s;ticks of the Body Politick; that if the Apothecarys be over nouri&s;ht, they will &s;tarve the Doctors; or if the Di&s;pen&s;ary be over fed (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> they would wil|lingly be) they will &s;tarve the Apothecaries and other Doctors: and if every Part di&s;regard the Intere&s;t of the Whole, the College will &s;oon be di&s;&s;olved, which
<PB N="39" REF="38">God grant, unle&s;s they will effectually reform. <HI>Amen.</HI> But the Doctor adds,</P>
<P><Q>'If therefore a Phy&s;ician is &s;uppos'd to have learnt whatever has been ob&s;er|ved of the different Affections and Di&s;orders from Childhood to Old-age, of the Sexes in all the Circum&s;tances, how Sea&s;ons and Climates alter us, what changes are made by all &s;orts of Diet, to have noted the U&s;e and Site of all Parts by Anatomy, the Virtue of Medicines by the trial Chymi&s;try affords, but e&s;pecially the Hi&s;tories of the almo&s;t innumerable Di&s;ea&s;es given by Au|thors, their Cau&s;es, Acce&s;s, Progre&s;s, Events and Con&s;equents of all Me|thods, and all Medicines, when he reflects on them, and compares them nicely with the Ca&s;e under his care, you will not oppo&s;e him to a Rival who has not had Philo&s;ophical Education, or the knowledg of any Language in which Phy&s;ick is treated. When you have determin'd what time is requir'd to collect from many Writers whatever is u&s;eful to the &s;afe and &s;ucce&s;sful Practice of Phy&s;ick, I would de&s;ire you to &s;tate the Years wherein any thing certain can be acquir'd from the Pre&s;cripts of the Art, without the Rea&s;ons given, or any regi&s;ter of the Succe&s;s. When Nature throws off the Common Di&s;orders of it &s;elf, and is able to bear any &s;ort of Phy&s;ick, the Apotheca|ry plies the Sick with Medicines he does not want, to pay for attending, magnifies the Di&s;ea&s;e, and his Skill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the&s;e the mo&s;t u&s;ual Ilne&s;&s;es, the Phy&s;ician &s;hews his Art by progno&s;ticating with integrity the a&s;&s;ur'd &s;ucce&s;s, which is a richer Cordial than the Shops afford, and merits his Reward. But when there &s;hall be <HI>nodus vindice d gnus,</HI> when <HI>dubiis trepidat victoria pennis;</HI> when the Experienc'd Phy&s;ician will doubt whether Nature acts to its own Pre&s;ervation, or wants the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Art, he will examine the Effects of one Medicine before he ri&s;ques the U&s;e of others; the ignorant and le&s;s &s;earful Advi&s;er will not lo&s;e the Opportunity of filling the Patient, and the Chamber to his own advantage. The&s;e are the Ca&s;es in which all the &s;evere&s;t, and mo&s;t ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations of the pre&s;ent and former Ages mu&s;t be con&s;ulted: the lea&s;t Errors make the Fever deadly, tho not to be di&s;cover'd but by the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Arti&s;t. They only can di&s;cern when Nature, attackt in all Parts, the Spirits wa&s;ted, and Blood exhau&s;ted, is ea&s;ily over-born by an active Cordial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The People indeed are &s;atisfied with the Apothecarys skill, who hears the Phy&s;icians di&s;our&s;e upon the Di&s;ea&s;e. Will you imagine he de&s;igns the &s;ure&s;t In&s;truction to his Scholar, who will &s;et up for a Ma&s;ter next hour? But he makes up the Note, and &s;ees the Operation. The In|&s;trument-maker, tho he make the Knife and Forceps, will not pretend to u&s;e them as the Surgeon. I will, after you have con&s;ider'd it, de&s;ire your Opini|on whether you would communicate a Specifick efficacious Medicine to the Apothecary, which he would in&s;tantly make up for every Cu&s;tomer in the &s;ame, or as he thinks not much differing Ca&s;es: Will any Merchant or Artificer ex|po&s;e

But we cannot di&s;cover our Secrets to any but our own Profe&s;&s;ion, which is the manner of applying the Medicine to the latent exigence of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Some Fevers go off, being only undi&s;turbed, Water is the riche&s;t Cordial in others, and the rich Compo&s;ition procures to others a certain Malignity. Will you value the Surgeon from the tipping of his In&s;truments, or from his Judgment and Steadine&s;s of Hand in u&s;ing them? The mo&s;t common and &s;imple may have a better effect than the mo&s;t pompous Apparatus. The few of our co&s;tly Ingredients have been kept in u&s;e to cover the Fraud of Exaction, but &s;pecially becau&s;e we plea&s;e our &s;elves, that they are de&s;igned for the u&s;e of the <HI>Grand Monde,</HI> while we pity the little People, who we imagine cannot live without them. But Providence hath otherwi&s;e provided in its grand Ho&s;pital, we are upon the Level there. The Poor do not want &s;o much as the Rich, but may have the mo&s;t valued &s;imple Re|medies, and the be&s;t Chymical or Galenical Preparations at an expence they, or their Patrons with an ea&s;y Charity may bear.'</Q></P>

But I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, neither of the Adver&s;aries have been grounded as they ought in Philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially the Experimental; but as being an Apothecary does not make a Man incapable of it, &s;o being of the College, yea of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, does not nece&s;&s;arily include it.

<P>be the Man; &s;uch a one perhaps may di&s;cern when he has exhau&s;ted the Blood, and wa&s;ted the Spirits, and Nature will be overborn by an active Cordial. But the Doctor is afraid the People will think the Apothe|caries skilful (that Gentleman has a&s;&s;ur'd us, his Ma&s;ter was not) by hearing the Doctor talk, and by making up his Medicines, and &s;eeing their Operations; tho he a&s;&s;ures us he has been careful le&s;t he &s;hould give him any &s;ure In&s;truc|tions: but if his In&s;tructions by his Practice be &s;o fallacious, he that de&s;igns to be skill'd will take a better Method to learn than the Sight of the fearful or confident Doctor's Practice can be, who&s;e In&s;truments could he but know their u&s;e, as well as the Surgeon does his, there were more occa&s;ion of Caution who looks on. There has been no great danger of Apothecaries learning
<PB N="42" REF="41">Efficacious Specificks of the Doctors, &s;ince they practi&s;e by the Di&s;pen&s;atory; or the Sick finding the Benefit, &s;ince it is di&s;honourable to give a private Medi|cine without Writing. But the manner of applying the Medicine to the la|tent Exigence of the Di&s;ea&s;e, he tells us, is the Doctors Secret; &s;o not the Medicine it &s;elf, or its artful Preparation: yet it is to be applied to &s;omething <HI>la|tent,</HI> mu&s;t we think it &s;o to the Doctor, or is it that which is adapted to e&s;cape on|ly the Eyes of the Apothecary? May not he po&s;&s;ibly learn what Fevers will go off of them&s;elves, or to give them a Specifick that will only do no hurt? Cannot he di&s;gui&s;e a &s;ufficient quantity of <HI>Aqua &s;implex,</HI> or Dr. <HI>Bates</HI>'s <HI>Hy|dropeg.</HI> to reckon the value of two or three Guineas for; and &s;o &s;ave the charge of a Di&s;pen&s;atory co&s;tly malignant Compo&s;ition? The Judgment of the Phy&s;ician will never make either a bad Medicine valuable, or him &s;o who has no good ones, any more than the tipping of the In&s;truments will render a Surgeon skilful, or the &s;weetne&s;s of the Syrups and Con&s;erves recommend either the Dr. that pre&s;cribes them, or the Apothecary that prepares them. But a Sur|geon that knows not whether his In&s;truments be good, cannot be thought very expert, any more than a Doctor that knows not the Medicines he pre&s;cribes. The Doctors having but newly &s;et up, and not made any great returns, would have us &s;uppo&s;e common and cheap Medicines the be&s;t, that the le&s;s Stock may &s;erve; rich active Medicines we cannot expect there, they &s;o complain again&s;t them, they are but to cover the Fraud of the exacting Apothecaries. But that they may not lo&s;e the &s;mall Fi&s;h, the Poor are promi&s;ed the mo&s;t valued Simples, and the be&s;t Chymical and Galenical Preparations at a &s;mall expence; which if they cannot pay, they mu&s;t endeavour to get their Patrons to do for them: but whatever of the mo&s;t valued Simples may be found in the Repo&s;ito|ry, I will promi&s;e neither Poor nor Rich &s;hall be able to purcha&s;e the be&s;t Chymical Preparations thence. He &s;ays further,</P>
<P><Q>'To demon&s;trate this, I will remove the Rubbi&s;h, and lay before you the Simples of the greate&s;t Virtue, and be&s;t Preparations, &s;upported by the be&s;t Trials of Chymi&s;try, and con&s;tant Experience. Gold, the great Idol of Mankind, mu&s;t be rejected as u&s;ele&s;s, while it makes the World re&s;tle&s;s, and anxious to obtain it; it has in it &s;elf no active Parts or energy to procure any Effect, it is not di&s;&s;olvable by any Humour in the Body; nothing there can alter it, or be altered by it: The compact heavy &s;luggi&s;h Parts re&s;i&s;t the Impre&s;&s;ion of every Animal Agent, which on the other &s;ide are &s;ecure from any Power it has. The golden Pill in the twi&s;ting of the Bowels by its weight only, may open the pa&s;&s;age, but it co&s;ts you only for the U&s;e of it. The lea&s; Gold on Boles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divert the Mind from the Ta&s;t, only by the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it; adds nothing to the Virtue, and only a trifle to the Expence: the Leaf may lie on the Mouths of the Ve&s;&s;els undi&s;&s;olved, and it
<PB N="43" REF="42">prevents the di&s;&s;olving of purging and alterative Pills if well gilded, un|le&s;s to your good Fortune the Cover happens to be broken.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the Doctor would be plain, I &s;uppo&s;e Gold is none of the Rubbi&s;h he would have removed from the Di&s;pen&s;ary; tho he would not have it come too much into the Apothecaries Shop. But for the Credit of Chy|mi&s;try, and its greate&s;t Ma&s;ters, I mu&s;t tell him he is not &s;upported by its be&s;t Trials: the greate&s;t Phy&s;icians and Chymi&s;ts the World has had, affirm it capable of Preparation into very great Medicines; and even in Sub&s;tance it has been &s;uppo&s;ed by no &s;mall Men, to be of con&s;iderable Efficacy; witne&s;s the famed Cure of the King's Evil, where Gold mu&s;t not be omitted or laid a|&s;ide, but the Di&s;ea&s;e returns. Doctors them&s;elves are very anxious to obtain this Rubbi&s;h, or they would never quarrel with the Apothecaries for getting it from them; and if it makes them &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, it mu&s;t needs have active Parts: <HI>quod agit agit</HI> is undoubtedly true. But methinks any Man that experiences the getting of Gold, may be &s;en&s;ible how refre&s;hing it is, and how it &s;ets all Wheels agoing. But to come a little nearer, if Gold were not di&s;&s;olvable in any of our Humours, it does not follow that it may not be a Medicine; What Humour will di&s;&s;olve burnt Hartshorn in the <HI>Decoct. album,</HI> Sulphur, &s;ome Gums, Woods, Stones, and other things commonly u&s;ed by Doctors? But that Gold does not re&s;i&s;t the Impre&s;&s;ion of every Animal Agent, the Doc|tor might have known if he had been &s;omething of a Chymi&s;t. That Body that the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> will not work upon, it ea&s;ily tore to pieces by the addition of a little <HI>Sal-armoniack,</HI> and then by the addition of a little Spi|rit of <HI>&V;rine</HI> precipitated into a Pouder, perhaps the mo&s;t active Body in Na|ture, <HI>viz. Aurum fulminans,</HI> which in &s;ome Ca&s;es is not a contemptible Medicine; but when it &s;hall be opened and volatilized, it will do what the Doctor never &s;aw performed. Whether crude Gold does either good or hurt taken inwardly, is not very apparent; I believe the Doctor never &s;aw the Guts twi&s;ted (an Anato|mi&s;t would hardly think it po&s;&s;ible) or was &s;ure they were untwi&s;ted by the Golden Pill. If the Leaf may &s;top the Mouths of the Ve&s;&s;els, which the Doc|tor is not certain of, the Animal would not be &s;ecure from its Power to ob&s;truct, which is &s;ometimes profitable, but the Doctor be &s;ure to contradict him&s;elf. If it would prevent the Di&s;&s;olution of the Pills, it might &s;ometimes be to the Patients good Fortune.</P>
<P><Q>'But <HI>Bezoar</HI> (&s;ays he) is rejected by mo&s;t Phy&s;icians, who think on what they advi&s;e. It has the u&s;e of the Philo&s;ophers Stone, procures Gold, or much Silver to every thing where it is a part: it adds to the Do&s;e only two Pence; but the very Name <HI>Bezoardick</HI> makes the cheape&s;t Boles and Juleps pa&s;s off at any Price.

<PB N="44" REF="43">The Pearl Juleps have their value from the Cordial Water, and white Sugar; they may take it for the &s;uture 3 or 4 Pence the Do&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Virtues of <HI>Bezoar</HI> have not been found &s;o great as the Value, the Doctor is right here; it may &s;erve as an Ab&s;orbent, but other things ea&s;ier to be purcha&s;ed by young Shopkeepers will do. The &s;ame mu&s;t be &s;aid of Pearls, unle&s;s radically di&s;&s;olved: greater effects have not been found by them given in Sub&s;tance, than may be procured by Oy&s;ter Shells, or the like. But I am not of the Doctor's Opinion, that the Pearl Juleps take any of their Virtue from the Sugar, unle&s;s to plea&s;e the Ta&s;t, to which tho it be &s;o grateful, it is not &s;o to a Sick Stomach, and a Feveri&s;h Blood, being apt to ferment and trun &s;our: Yet if any Gentleman or Lady is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of either of the&s;e, it is to be had at the Shop at the College in <HI>Warwick-Lane,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Fro&s;t</HI>'s Coffee-Hou&s;e, and at the two gilded Spires in St. <HI>Martins Lane;</HI> the Doctor a&s;&s;ures you cheap and good.

<P><Q>'Ambergrea&s;e and Musk are offen&s;ive to many, from the Name as well as Scent, corrupt the Blood, and Spirits, and by altering the Breath make the u&s;e in Perfumes more nece&s;&s;ary; the Confections and Waters are more whole&s;om without them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> That Ambergrea&s;e and Musk corrupt the Blood and Spirits, the Doctor has never found by any certain Experiment, I believe; but that they re|fre&s;h the Spirits, mo&s;t Authors agree with Doctor Experience. Some Per&s;ons have a peculiar di&s;gu&s;t at the mo&s;t innocent thing; but otherwi&s;e grateful Scents are very welcome to Nature, and the &s;mall Quantity that is given, they acting only by their Flavor or Odor, makes the u&s;e of them cheap enough. The Doctors need not fear the charge of keeping a little of them.</P>
<P><Q>'Our precious Stones co&s;t little (continues he) and are worth nothing. The Hyacinth, Smaragd. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> finely poudred, are as u&s;eful as Gla&s;s well pre|pared: the famous Confect of Hyacinth &s;ells two Pence the Do&s;e; Oil of Cinnamon, or other Chymical Oils given but to few Drops, are to be e|&s;teemed at the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Price in &s;o &s;mall a Quantity.

<P><HI>Remark.</HI> It is true, the precious Stones the Doctors have ordered the A|pothecaries to keep, and abu&s;ed in Phy&s;ick, are of very little worth, unle&s;s they are large; they &s;hew the Igonrance of tho&s;e that have pre&s;cribed them in their Receits, but &s;ome are to be commended for beginning to be wi&s;er. Chy|mical Oils are of a great Value as to u&s;e, being the E&s;&s;ences of tho&s;e Herbs that yield them, but are commonly given in too &s;mall a Quantity, or not us'd as
<PB N="45" REF="44">they ought to produce the Effects they otherwi&s;e might. That Cochineal promi|&s;es its colour to the Blood, I never heard till now, or that any &s;uppo&s;e it will tinge the Cheeks unle&s;s outwardly us'd: This notable Body is al&s;o given in too &s;mall a Quantity to di&s;cover its Effects, tho the Price of it need not hinder its u&s;e. But the Doctor had rather be in the Fields.</P>
<Q><P>'I divert you (&s;ays he) from the more plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the Gardens, Fields, Woods, Rivers, which plentifully afford us the mo&s;t effectual and cer|tain Relief: their value in the Quantities us'd at one time are below any Coin, and the Cooking in &s;mall proportions will not amount to much more.'</P>
<P>'The Flowers, Fruits and Seeds, the Leaf, Root, Wood, and Bark are di&s;til'd &s;imply, or with Water, or Spirit of Wine; beaten with Sugar into Con|&s;erves, boil'd into Syrups; compound the Pounders, Troches, and Pills; with Water or Wine, make the Decoctions, and Apozems. The Con&s;erves in the Do&s;e are a Farthing or two, the Syrups not much more; Pouders a Penny the Scruple, or half a Dram. The famous Ga&s;coin Pouder without Bezoar; or 4 Pence the Do&s;e: Waters di&s;til'd from Spirit of Wine therefore us'd in &s;mall quantities, not dearer than a Gla&s;s of Wine. But the Ingredients better cho|&s;en, or &s;ingly infus'd in a proper &s;imple di&s;til'd Water, would prove more Alexiterial, and de&s;erve the title of High Rich Cordial at a le&s;s Expence. When you have ta&s;ted the former Cordials in your Friends Chamber, have you not felt the Tumult in your Stomach of &s;uch a Rabble of the Spices, which broil'd by the Fire di&s;turb you an your a&s;ter, and make you pity his Condition under the often repeated Do&s;es? The Apozems Hepatick, Splenetick, Diuretick, or Sudorifick, are made at 2<HI>d.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> or 6<HI>d.</HI> the Quart in Spring Water, which divi|ded and &s;ent in little Gla&s;&s;es ri&s;e beyond the Price of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> You may hence judg of our Oils, Ointments, and Pla&s;ters; that the Surgeon reward|ed for his Skill and Care, does not put you in mind of the Co&s;t he has been put to thro the whole Cure. You are well acquainted with the Prices of Drugs imported; as they are mo&s;t of a hot Spicy Nature, their Do&s;e can be but &s;mall, the Price proportionable. If many are ab&s;urdly join'd toge|ther, the Quantity of each is &s;o much the le&s;s. The Treacle of 60 Drugs does not claim a Penny the Do&s;e.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> Vegetables di&s;til'd &s;imply are for the mo&s;t part Simple, or no Me|dicines; can &s;erve only for Vehicles, but when kept a little are commonly corrupted, and &s;ome way ill ta&s;ted; &s;ome fair times of the Year is more whole&s;om than mo&s;t of their Preparations commonly in U&s;e, if the &s;ick could but walk out and take it. The Di&s;tilling &s;ome of them with &s;imple di&s;til'd Water yields nothing but &s;imple di&s;til'd Water, and Spirit of Wine rai&s;es no|thing from others. A good Pharmaceutick mu&s;t know the Nature of the thing,
<PB N="46" REF="45">and adapt his Men&s;trums, which the Learned have not well done in the <HI>London</HI> Di&s;pen&s;atory in many Receits: The huddling up a Farrago of different things with Honey, or Sugar, has not &s;hown much of their skill, or the Rea&s;on of the Compo&s;ition of their Pouders much appear'd. But our reform'd Doctor is of Opinion that the Ingredients in&s;us'd in a &s;imple di&s;till'd Water would be more Alexiterial, and be richer Cordials than di&s;til'd from Spirit of Wine: but I think the Doctor canot be excus'd of Ignorance here, for Spirit of Wine is certainly a better Cordial than &s;imple Water; every Porter knows the Differ|cence between the Cock and the Brandy-bottle. But tho&s;e things which are or|der'd to be di&s;til'd with Spirit of Wine by tho&s;e that know what they do, are full of oily Parts which will not be extracted, and mixt with &s;imple Water; and to give all things in &s;ub&s;tance would &s;o clog the Stomach with the Quan|tities of the Husks that hold the &s;mall Proportion of Medicinal Juices, that no other Effect would be produced but the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Nature. A rabble of Spices cannot be conjoyn'd by any that would have their &s;ingle Virtues to be &s;een; nor will they be broil'd in Spirit of Wine by one that knows how to work; and a &s;mall Gla&s;s of a pure Cordial Spirit I'l engage &s;hall remain more grateful to the Stomach of &s;ick or well, than half a Pint or a Pint of a muddy loath&s;om Infu&s;ion or Decoction that will corrupt in a few days time. But I hope the Doctors of the Di&s;pen&s;ary will not pretend to keep Oils, Ointments and Pla&s;ters, the&s;e belong to the Surgeon, unle&s;s they will be &s;o kind al&s;o as to let him have them at the intrin&s;ick Value, that he may no more be cheated by the A|potheracy. The Surgeon is now become the hone&s;te&s;t fellow of all, (whatever he may be for healing tho&s;e Sores that wont't be well without internal Remedies) he outdoes the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pen&s;ary Men by their own confe&s;&s;ion; he demands not &s;o much as the co&s;t he has been at, but is contended to be &s;ufficiently paid for his skill, care and pains. The Di&s;pen&s;ary will reckon 3<HI>s.</HI> a day for Medicines; but why may not the Apothecary be as hone&s;t as either, and keep a few ordinary Herbs, and cheap Drugs, and cook them in his pipkin, and reckon nothing but for his Skill and Vi&s;its? I &s;hould think what is <HI>&s;auce for a Goo&s;e might be &s;auce for a Gander al&s;o.</HI> But &s;ays the Doctor further,</P>
<P><Q>'You may judg of the ea&s;y expence of what we advi&s;e by another view, the various Operations.

I need not inform you how ea&s;ily the fillings of Steel are pro|cur'd. If you infu&s;e them with bitter Plants, or boil to a Syrup, you will readily e&s;timate a Quart. All the Ecphractisk, or Deob&s;truents, and Aperi|tives, Incra&s;&s;ating, or A&s;tringents, agree in their great u&s;e, and almo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;i|ble

<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Doctor &s;ets up another inch of Candle, that you may have ano|ther view of the cheap pennyworths he has at his Shop: This famous Vomit is a Penny <HI>per</HI> Do&s;e, his head-Pills, &s;tomach-Pills, bowel-Pills no more; cheaper than <HI>Tom Saffold's</HI> 18 for 18 pence, altho too cheap in any Man's own &s;en&s;e: But the other that are valuable only for their &s;ucce&s;s (the true rule of valuing all Remedies) will often have no value at all. A few Do&s;es of Iron in a Quart of Water, you may have very cheap. Aperitives, and A&s;tringents, the Keys of our Bodies, of &s;uch great u&s;e, can hardly have any price. Rubard indeed, that &s;o finely opens the Backdore, and &s;huts it after it, you mu&s;t pay a little dearer for now and then; and if you meet with one of Doctor <HI>Harvey</HI>'s <HI>Medici &s;tercorarii,</HI> he perhaps will pre&s;cribe you nothing el&s;e. But he tells us farther,</P>
<P><Q>'That out of the&s;e Drugs many kinds of Chymical Medicines are prepar'd at the Expence of only Fire, and the U&s;e of the Gla&s;&s;es, in great quantities.

<P><HI>Remark.</HI> If the Doctor had been us'd to Chymi&s;try, he would have known that its preparations are not made at the mere expence of Fire, and u&s;e of Gla&s;&s;es, which were it &s;o would not be a &s;mall Expence; in many Preparations great Fires are us'd; and Gla&s;&s;es &s;erve but once, &s;ometimes not once, but break, and lo&s;e a thing of great value: be&s;ides, there is &s;ometimes a large expence of time the mo&s;t precious thing of all, and a great deal of labour.

If the Patient be not ince&s;&s;antly plied, and the Phy&s;ician will have care when he has done enough for one day, and will give the Patient a little re&s;t, before he &s;ets him another Task: If the Fever truly intermits, has no Malignity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you may u&s;e the Bark only prepared by poudering, which co&s;ts no more than the Wine you drink it with. I have heard you extol the wonder|ful Force of Opiates, from your Experience, in Cholick and Nephritick Pains. 'Tis true, that Plant has no equal among the Vegetables, nor does any Metal or Mineral pretend to rival it; but the riche&s;t Preparation of this great Ano|dyne rai&s;es no in quietude upon any other Circum&s;tance: The poor may have it as well as the riche&s;t, from a &s;mall Charity, which will give the Donor the ea&s;e it procures to the Patients pain. It is not therefore demon&s;trated, that in Sickne&s;s no Con&s;titution can bear the u&s;e of more than two or three Shillings value in a Day? The deare&s;t Cordial Waters, and Alexiterial Pouders cannot in the time be u&s;ed above that Price, without inflaming the Blood and Spirits into a <HI>Delirium,</HI> and forcing our common putrid Fevers into malignant. The milder Diaphoreticks, Diureticks and Alteratives don't pretend to be rated with the other; but in our common Fevers the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature, the others de|&s;troy it.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> In Fevers, and Small-pox, tho the Doctor &s;eels his Sallets and other Coolers, or his &s;weetning Pouders with his &s;imple Juleps, very cheap; yet his cooling, and exhau&s;ting the Blood, and thereby checking the Motion of Nature, in ca&s;ting off the Morbifick matter, often co&s;ts the Patient dear, even his Life. If in Fevers more malignant, Treacle, Mithridate, and Aroma|ticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are to be e&s;teemed for their Virtues of &s;weating, and heating the Blood; how can they be condemned &s;o in milder Fevers? And why may not the cooling Apozems be u&s;ed here, where there is more heat? But why may not Doctor err in cooling, and fixing too much, a&s;&s;oon as in heating and di&s;&s;olving too much? I &s;hould think either Method may tire the Patient, or Nature it &s;elf; but if tho&s;e things are given which ought to be given, <HI>viz.</HI> proper Medicines, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e they ought not to be any <HI>Gravamen,</HI> but a <HI>Levamen</HI> to Nature. The Bark is mo&s;t of it fai&s;e, and every Doctor does not know the true, or be&s;t way to give it; and the fal&s;e will co&s;t a Man dear &s;ometimes. <HI>Opium</HI> is a thing of great Force, but it has a Malignity in it, which none of our common Arti&s;ts know how to &s;eparate without &s;poiling it; if that were done, a Do&s;e might de&s;erve a Doctor's Fee: but I cannot yield to the Doctor, that it has not its equal among the Vegetables; there are many other Poi&s;ons as effectual, and if skilfully prepared, of good u&s;e, tho none &s;o
<PB N="49" REF="48">much u&s;ed; nor can I be per&s;uaded but that there are many Plants that have as eminent Virtues for their proper Ends, without &s;o much Malignity, as <HI>Opium:</HI> Metals and Minerals, I mu&s;t tell him, pretend to exceed it; the ano|dyne Sulphur of <HI>Venus</HI> has its Virtue without its Poi&s;on, but the Doctor will laught at that as a <HI>Chymera.</HI> The ignorant will deny the being of that which is beyond their Skill. But I mu&s;t tell him, we Chymi&s;ts have known Re&s;t procu|red by a Preparation of Copper, when <HI>Opinium</HI> would not do it. The Doctor thinks he has demon&s;trated, that no Patient can well take more than 2 or 3 Shillings a day in Phy&s;ick; but if he had well demon&s;trated, what they ought to expend in Fees for the intrin&s;ick value of Advice, we might have had more Encouragement to come to their Shop: I wi&s;h he has &s;hown how Cordial Alexiterial Medicines cure in malignant Fevers, and de&s;troy in the commons and that the Mild a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature only in the&s;e, but not in the other. But to go on, &s;ays the Doctor,</P>
<Q><P>'Where's then the My&s;tery of rai&s;ing the Bill to 1, 2, 3 or 4 Pounds each Day, by the Artifice of rai&s;ing the Part equal to the whole, and &s;ending the Apozem, or Julep in little Parcels? The Electuary is &s;old well at 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> but the Boles come to each as much, tho it afford to Children 20 Boles. The contrivance of giving in a parcht Mouth, fur'd Throat, and nau&s;eating Stomach, an ill ta&s;ted Bole, when the langui&s;hing Patient can &s;wallow no|thing but Liquids, has been re&s;erved for this Age. The Bole of ful&s;om Con&s;erve, or Treacle, is to be taken every 3d, 4th or 5th Hour, which di&s;pels all Re&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There's a little Julep ready to wa&s;h it down: and this is of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to the Apothecary; becau&s;e the Town has been u&s;ed to pay 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> for each Bole, and not much le&s;s for the Draught to clean&s;e the Mouth after it. This Advice was given to a Phy&s;ician at his fir&s;t entrance on the Stage, to order a Bole with a Draught every fourth Hour; which however it fare with the Patient, would recommend him to the Apotheca|ries.'</P>
<P>'The hone&s;t Phy&s;ician mixes the Bole and Julep together, that the feeble Pa|tient may drink his Cordial, to revive and compo&s;e him, without the Di&s;|turbance of taking it at twice, and with Difficulty the other way.'</P></Q>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> There's now no My&s;tery of rai&s;ing the Bill to &s;o many Pounds, &s;ince the Doctor has di&s;covered it; 'tis well when Men begin to have &s;ome Con|&s;cience, and di&s;cover one anothers unlawful Gains. The contrivance of giv|ing ill-ta&s;ted and ful&s;om, either Boles or any thing el&s;e, muddly horrid Decoc|tions and Infu&s;ions at any time, is not proper for a nau&s;eating or well Sto|mach, a fur'd Throat, or parcht Mouth, and whatever they are mixt with, to delude the Stomach to admit them, it commonly &s;uffers for it afterwards. I do not wonder at the Advice given to the Doctor, at his fir&s;t entrance on the
<PB N="50" REF="49">Stage; nor do I think the Mountebank, if he knew his Intere&s;t, did re|ject it. But it is a &s;trange Character of an hone&s;t Phy&s;ician, or Di&s;pen&s;a|ry-Doctor, that he is one that mixes his Bole and Julep together, and won't let his Patient have the plea&s;ant reli&s;h of the Liq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">or at la&s;t, with|out the horrid Ta&s;t of the Bole: I hope he will order hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome fine &s;im|ple thing or other, &s;eeing he can afford things &s;o cheap to wa&s;h both a|way. In my Opinion it would be the part of a more hone&s;t, or at lea&s;t wi&s;er Phy&s;ician, never to give any thing that will di&s;turb his Patient. But &s;ays the Doctor,</P>
<P><Q>'I pre&s;ume you will allow the Corollary, that by much Phy&s;ick divided in|to little Parcels, and rated high, the Apothecary has in the Reward of his Attendance (which by the Phy&s;ician is often excu&s;ed) much greater Fees, often trebly or quadruply more than the Faculty. You will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, if it be a&s;&s;erted, that in a Bill of 10<HI>l.</HI> nine are the Rewards of his Advice, and Attendance. The People mu&s;t accu&s;e their own Conduct, who never gratifying the Apothecary's Vi&s;its, oblige him to bring in for every 3 or 4 Hours and &s;everal Days, as much as will an&s;wer one of the ends he propo&s;es to him&s;elf. Can he thus neglected by his Cu&s;tomers, with Safety to him&s;elf advi&s;e the Waters, Milk, Temperance, Repo&s;e, Exerci&s;e, a peculiar Diet, or the Country Air, by which ob&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;es are cured, to the reproach of the Compo&s;itions of the Shop? But what redre&s;s can be expected to the&s;e Grievances? There mu&s;t be certain Rates &s;et to all the Medicines, with the greate&s;t Encouragements to the Apothecaries to prepare them faithfully. They mu&s;t bring their Number by the mo&s;t proper Methods to be equal to the Occa&s;ion the City has for u&s;ing their Preparations. The former antiqua|ted Methods mu&s;t be revived, by which the People were ea&s;t without the pre&s;ent either Su&s;picions, or Complaints. The Phy&s;icians lay under no Temp|tation to impo&s;e on the Publick, they advi&s;ed at their own Hou&s;es in the Chronical, or le&s;s dangerous Di&s;orders, and di&s;tingui&s;hed in their Vi&s;its the Differences of the Condition of the Per&s;ons, and Di&s;ea&s;es; and arrived to a Re|putation, not by the ba&s;e&s;t Arts, but their Care, and the Merit of the Suc|ce&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> The Burden of this long Song again&s;t the Apothecaries is &s;till, that they are too numerous for the Doctors, and get as much or more Money for their Medicines, than the Doctors can for Advice. But after all this out|cry again&s;t them for multiplying the Numbers of them&s;elves and Medicines, he confe&s;&s;es the Peoples Conduct is to be accu&s;ed as the Cau&s;e as the&s;e Evils, by not gratifying the Apothecary with Fees for his Vi&s;its; and &s;o obliging him to bring in &s;o many Medicines as will an&s;wer one End he propo&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> a Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">elyhood: If the People would be but &s;o wi&s;e, as to give the Apothecary
<PB N="51" REF="50">his Fee for Advice or Attendance, and the College would be &s;o good as not to per&s;ecute him for taking it, he might afford his Wares as cheap as the Shop|keepers in <HI>Warwick</HI> and St. <HI>Martins-Lanes,</HI> and might advi&s;e his Patients the mo&s;t compendious and ea&s;y Method, and do for them as he would for him&s;elf, or own Family; he might keep a &s;maller and more &s;elect Number of Reme|dies, and advi&s;e the Waters, Milk, Temperance, Repo&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and live as well as the other Trade&s;men, and do the People more good, and le&s;s harm at le&s;s charge, than he does by every 3 or 4 Hours <HI>Repetaturs;</HI> and cure &s;tubborn Di&s;ea&s;es, by hindering the Sick from taking the reproachful Phy&s;ick either of the new or old Shops. But the Redre&s;s the Doctor propo&s;es of the&s;e Grievances, I think is ridiculous, <HI>viz.</HI> the Apothecaries to encourage them to pre|pare their Remedits faithfully, and give but few of them, mu&s;t have their Medicins rates at a &s;mall Price by the Doctors; which were it rea&s;onable, could not ea&s;ily be done by tho&s;e Gentlemen, not yet well skilled in Drugs and Preparations. Yet this won't do alone, their Numbers mu&s;t be reduced to equal the Occa&s;ion the City has for their Preparations: How &s;hall we know what Numbers will &s;erve, or what Occa&s;ions the City may have for their Preparations? &s;ome affec|ted Chymi&s;t would &s;ay, the City has no occa&s;ion for any Galenical Stuff; and I to be free mu&s;t &s;ay, for mo&s;t of it. But what are the proper Methods to re|duce them, or which ought to be di&s;carded, that the Remnant may live, by &s;elling a few Medicines of &s;mall Value? &s;hall they be condemned to be hanged, and ca&s;t Lots to &s;ave one in ten? Shall the greate&s;t Part be pre&s;&s;ed to fight the <HI>French,</HI> put in the Front and be &s;lain by the Sword, or the Enemy, for being &s;o unfortunate as to po&s;&s;e&s;s the fair Lady <HI>Pecunia,</HI> which the ruling Doctors are &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in love with? But after all I mu&s;t tell him, I hate this wicked monopolizing Policy of men, that would get a good Trade into few Hands: This is not the way to have the People &s;erved hone&s;tly, when they cannot go to him that will u&s;e them be&s;t; but the Commodities are ingro&s;&s;ed, and &s;old by a Combination. If the Apothecaries do increa&s;e more in Propor|tion than other People, their own Increa&s;e will de&s;troy them, the Trade will be good for nothing, and none will put their Sons to it; but their Apprentices &s;erving 8, when other Trades do but 7 Years, would per&s;uade one they can|not outgrow their Trade.</P>
<P>What the antiquated Methods are the Doctor talks of, as de&s;irous to have revived, I don't know. But &s;uch they mu&s;t be, that the People will not ea&s;ily &s;u&s;pect or complain of the cheat, but be ea&s;y under it, while the Doctors ea&s;ily get their Money. But if &s;uch a Method were ever in u&s;e, or may be contrived, where the Phy&s;icians lie under no Temptation to impo&s;e on the Publick, that I &s;hould be for; and &s;uch wherein they might arrive to Reputation, not by ba&s;e Arts, but by their Care, and the Merit of their Succe&s;s, that I &s;hould
<PB N="52" REF="51">extremely like: But I think our hone&s;t Doctors and Merchants have not yet propo&s;ed any &s;uch Method, neither &s;hall I now attempt it, but rather expect it in the hone&s;t Country-Phy&s;ician's An&s;wer to this long and tedious Epi&s;|tle.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> The Country-Phy&s;ician's An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, that I may not wholly balk your Expectation, or neglect any thing wherein I may po&s;&s;ibly do my Country any Service, I &s;hall in as few Words as I can give you my Opinion of the Medicinal War you &s;ent me an account of, and the be&s;t Methods I can think of to bring it to an end; &s;o that the Country which is the Seat of the War, may now and hereafter feel the lea&s;t of its ill effects. You know no one, that can be a capable Judg of the&s;e Matters, to be le&s;s intere&s;ted than I; who have not practi&s;ed the&s;e many Years with Apothecaries, or in any Confederacies; who have done nothing to oblige them, or di&s;oblige them, or had any Dependance upon them, or any others belonging to the Faculty, for Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Medicines to u&s;e in it, being by Profe&s;&s;ion a clean Independent in Medicine, and &s;o re&s;olve to &s;tand on my own Legs, or fall.</P>
<P>And I mu&s;t tell you in the fir&s;t Place, that I perceive the ground of the Quarrel here, is the very &s;ame as of that between the <HI>French</HI> and the Empe|ror, <HI>Self-intere&s;t,</HI> and the &s;tronge&s;t Party I believe will never yield to any thing, but for their own Advantage; and were I Plenipotentiary in the Affair, no Articles of Reconciliation &s;hould ever be concluded between them, &s;o as to unite them into a new Confederacy. There are too many of them combin'd &s;till, and the &s;ingle Parties at difference are either of them potent enough to be of|ten too hard for the People. What the Doctor owns in his Conclu&s;ion would be very good, could it but be effected, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Phy&s;ician lie under no Temptation to impo&s;e upon the People, and have no way to arrive to Reputa|tion, but by his Care, and the Merit of his Succe&s;s. It would be a happy World, if Phy&s;icians, &s;ome of the mo&s;t obnoxious Men in it to Temptations, were liable to none; the re&s;t of Men would doubtle&s;s be free. If they could not be tempted to impo&s;e on the Publick, and had no way to rai&s;e a Reputati|on, but by their Care and Succe&s;s; very few I think would be of any great re|pute. But the &s;trengthening of Parties and Confederacies, to oppre&s;s others,
<PB N="53" REF="52">or create Dependencies, is not the way to do this happy thing for their Souls, and the Peoples Bodies. But I will tell you in few Words, the be&s;t Policy to make them hone&s;t, and &s;ecure the People, is to break both the Armiss, that not a Man of them may act but in his &s;ingle Capacity; let there be none to command, none to obey, none acce&s;&s;ary; but who&s;oever is capable of the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Phy&s;ician, let him be Principal, and act in his concern independent upon any. But to leave allegorizing, and to repre&s;ent the matter to you plainly; the true Method to rai&s;e the Reputation of Phy&s;icians, and to &s;ecure the People as much as may be from any damage they might &s;u&s;tain by them, is this.</P>
<P>That every Man that undertakes to act as a Phy&s;ician, be skilled in all things pertaining to the Art, and that he him&s;elf perform, or at lea&s;t actually &s;ee per|formed, whatever belongs to the cure of Human Bodies; That there be no &s;uch thing as Doctor, Surgeon, and Apothecary, as di&s;tinct and dependent Faculties; but that the one Thing, the Phy&s;ician, be all of them, advi&s;ing, preparing, di&s;|pen&s;ing his own Remedies, and doing whatever belongs to a Surgeon for his Patient, with his own Hands. Here every Man will &s;tand and fall to him&s;elf, having no dependency on others, and him&s;elf reap the Fruit of his own doings whether good or evil.</P>
<P>The one Grand De&s;ign of Phy&s;ick is, <HI>the Recovery of the Patients;</HI> but there is a &s;econd thing, which a Phy&s;ician may hone&s;tly intend, <HI>his own advan|tageous Reputation,</HI> or if you will, <HI>honourable Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>To the attaining of the&s;e two Ends, as well as may be, it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that the Practitioner him&s;elf be &s;o well accompli&s;hed, that he might act of him|&s;elf independently, and &s;o perform whatever belongs to his Profe&s;&s;ion. That this is the only true Method of Phy&s;ick, wherein its Ends may be be&s;t attained, may &s;oon evidently appear, if we con&s;ider a little. Who&s;oever would de&s;erve the Name of a Phy&s;ician, ought not only to be very well read in <HI>Phy&s;iology</HI> and <HI>Pathology,</HI> but to be vers'd in <HI>Experimental Philo&s;ophy,</HI> the ground of all Phy&s;ical Science: To have well &s;tudied Nature in its intire and &s;ound State, and then to proceed to the Knowledg of its defects in order to remove them. But if a Man may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be never &s;o well acquainted with the <HI>Phenomena</HI> and Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es; yet if he be ignorant of Medicine, the means to remove them, his other Knowledg is to little purpo&s;e: but he will be ignorant of the means to remove Di&s;ea&s;es, if he's not skilled in Pharmacy. If he does not under&s;tand the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> the Natures and Properties of tho&s;e Bodies that are to be u&s;ed in healing, and the proper Methods and rea&s;ons of adapting them to the u&s;e of the Sick, whatever he has of liberal Learning, is to little purpo&s;e: he mu&s;t be a good <HI>Apothecary,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>Chymi&s;t,</HI> or he can never bring tho&s;e Bodies he would u&s;e, effectually to perform their Ends in Nature. But if he could be &s;upposd to under&s;tand the&s;e things in any tolerable Degree,
<PB N="54" REF="53">without practi&s;ing them, he may &s;till be at a lo&s;s, the Remedies he may pre|&s;cribe may not be to be had, may be only pretended, or not duly prepar'd, whereby he may lo&s;e the de&s;ired Effect to his own di&s;credit, and the Da|mage of his Patients. What Authors &s;ay of Remedies is not always true, and their goodne&s;s often depends on a Nicety of Preparation, which by mi&s;chance, carele&s;ne&s;s, or unskilfulne&s;s in Operation, often become good for nothing, and &s;ometimes not only &s;o, but virulent and hurtful. To tru&s;t to an Author for the Virtue of a Remedy we have never made, and don't under&s;tand the Nature of; to rely on an Apothecary or Chymi&s;t who has no other De&s;ign or Skill but to make, and &s;ell to the be&s;t Advantage, is not at all &s;afe, and will not be done by a Man that duly values his Patients welfare, and his own reputation. The Prepar|ing of Remedies with ones own hand is nece&s;&s;ary, not only in order to their ex|act and faithful Preparation; but in the very Operation there is often more &s;een of the Rea&s;on and Nature of the thing, than can be found from all Authors put toge|ther; and a great Part of Natural Philo&s;ophy is manife&s;t, and practically illu&s;tra|ted by the Analy&s;is, and Synthe&s;is of Bodies. In &s;hort, a Phy&s;ician ought to be &s;o well vers'd in his bu&s;ine&s;s, that if there were no Books, nor no venders of Medicines, he would know which way to go to work to provide him&s;elf a &s;ufficient Apparatus for the curing of all Di&s;ea&s;es he de&s;igns to meddle with. A|gain, as External and Internal Di&s;ea&s;es are often complicated, and dependent one upon another; Fevers and other Di&s;tempers break out into Abce&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Wounds, Brui&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> produce Fevers, <HI>Deliria,</HI> and the like: it is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the Chirurgeons Hand &s;hould grow upon the Phy&s;icians Arm, as that the Phy&s;icians Brain &s;hould move and direct it. Will it not be a Di&s;grace to a Phy&s;ician, as well as a Damage to the Patient, that he mu&s;t &s;it &s;taring upon the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Object, while a Surgeon who is not always to be found, is &s;ent for in a Ca&s;e where Phlebotomy is in&s;tantaneou&s;ly requir'd? Is it not indeed di&s;honourable, as well as di&s;advantageous to him and his Patient, that he is but one Limb of a Healer, and mu&s;t be beholden to another (perhaps wooden) Leg, calld in di&s;tinction a Surgeon, to perfect the Cure of a Bubo, Carbunkle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one who is &s;uppos'd (if not wi&s;ht) to be ignorant of the Internal Cau&s;es, Springs, and Effluxes of tho&s;e putrid Fountains? Or &s;hall a Surgeon not blu&s;h to be &s;o little a Phy&s;ician, as that his Head cannot work as well as his Hand? mu&s;t he needs call for one who perhaps has not &s;tudied the Internal <HI>fomes</HI> of an Ulcer, to pre&s;cribe him an internal Medicine, without which it cannot be healed? mu&s;t he never let blood in the mo&s;t needful Ca&s;e, without the advice of one that cannot do it? or mu&s;t the Patient be at the Charge of 3 di&s;tinct Operators, when one may, and ought to do all better, at the Charge of one of them? Be&s;ides, this three legged Stool has often one Leg defective or &s;horter than another, by which defect the weak Patient often falls to the ground, when he might have been up|held
<PB N="55" REF="54">held by one &s;olid Ba&s;is till he was able to ri&s;e and walk. The Doctor, a Surgeon, if ignorant of one anothers bu&s;ine&s;s, will be very liable to counter|work one another; or if ever &s;o well skill'd, they will divide the Care. The Surgeon will not &s;o much value the Succe&s;s of what he does merely by the Doctors order, and the Doctor will not reckon him&s;elf to blame if the Surgeon does not perform his part well. So the Apothecary, to come again to the 3d Noun Adjective; which with the other 2 are now adays thought convenient and able to be equivalent to a Sub&s;tantive the <HI>Healer,</HI> he will be &s;atisfied either with Health, or Death, or long Sickne&s;s of the Patient, if he has but &s;upply'd him with things according to the order of the Doctor: and he who is &s;uppos'd to &s;it at the helm of Life and Death, if the Ve&s;&s;el mi&s;carry, will be apt to lay the blame upon the Errors, or Di&s;obedience of &s;ome one or other of the Mariners. But the little Ship of Man's Body being within the reach and guidance of one only Arti&s;t, he will have more care to perform what is requi&s;ite to its &s;afety, becau&s;e he only will have the Honour, the Reward, or the Blame of his good or ill Suc|ce&s;s. I cannot forbear taking notice of another mi&s;take, &s;omewhat akin to what we have been di&s;cour&s;ing, and that is this: 'tis &s;uppos'd that in the Multitude of Coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety, when apply'd to Phy&s;icians. As for Apothecaries, and Surgeons, tho they be never &s;o well skill'd, or chance to &s;ee farther into the ca&s;e than the Doctor, or have a better Remedy than he knows, if they offer any thing, he will take it in di&s;dain, and no way admit what they &s;hall in|&s;inuate, of which I could give in&s;tances. But even in a Con&s;ult of Doctors, there is indeed le&s;s &s;afety: The di&s;grace, or the credit will be divided among&s;t them, whence the Care of the Sick will be the le&s;s. They will put the mo&s;t Celebra|ted to write, tho the greate&s;t Blockhead; none will much di&s;agree with the re&s;t: and if any one has a private Remedy more effectual, he will not advi&s;e that, or the re&s;t admit it without di&s;covering what it is; they will ea&s;ily agree not to di&s;grace the Faculty by contradicting one another, who if they were &s;eparate, they would be <HI>quot homines tot &s;ententiae;</HI> but one of the Doctors being more skilful than the re&s;t, if he were to act alone, would act freely, whenas &s;he mo&s;t know|ing being commonly the mo&s;t mode&s;t, will be &s;hy to be mo&s;t forward, or to differ from the re&s;t, but will leave the pre&s;cribing to the mo&s;t Proud, and Confident, whom he will ea&s;ily &s;uffer to run away with the Credit or Blame of the &s;ucce&s;s, and content him&s;elf with his Fee. But if any one, with a more than ordinary Concern for the Patient di&s;likes what the others advi&s;e, and offers a <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> or particular Method, they will be much di&s;gu&s;ted, and perhaps &s;ay, as in a Ca&s;e I might name, it is a College-ca&s;e, it mu&s;t not be.</P>
<P>But it would go better with the Sick, if in&s;tead of a Con&s;ult of Doctors at the Patient's hou&s;e, the one Phy&s;ician he thinks fit to employ would con&s;ult in his own behalf divers of his hone&s;t Brotherhood, and con&s;ider their Opinions,
<PB N="56" REF="55">and &s;o act according as he &s;hall then judg. But there are divers Objections I fore&s;ee may be made again&s;t this Method of &s;ingle and independent Practice, which mu&s;t be an&s;wered before I can well conclude the Subject; and they are of two &s;orts, either &s;uch as relate to the Method it &s;elf, or to the Method in relation to, and under the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Doctors, Chirurgeons, and Apothecaries.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it may be &s;aid it is indecorous for a Phy&s;ician to be concern'd with Manuals, di&s;honourable for him, who mu&s;t conver&s;e with the greate&s;t Per|&s;onages: it is enough to make a Lady that is well, fall &s;ick, to have her Pul&s;e felt by a rough brown Hand. But I &s;ay, whatever may be the Nicene&s;s of a Beaui&s;h Doctor, or however a Lady that is wantonly &s;ick may like a finical Fellow, that is the mo&s;t honourable and decorous Hand, that can bring the Sick mo&s;t help.</P>

<P>A &s;queami&s;h Doctor cannot more nau&s;eate any thing conducing to the Health of Men, than the handling &s;ome Chirurgical Ca&s;es incident to all &s;orts of Peo|ple; but being the Members of his Fellow-Creatures, his helpful Hand can|not abhor, with Honour or Hone&s;ty, to do that for another, he would need, and think rea&s;onable in the like ca&s;e to be done for him&s;elf; nor is it more ho|nourable to &s;hake the Urinal, <HI>vel Stercus Bacculo agitare;</HI> yea, or to turn over the Leaves of mouldy worm-eaten Authors, to in&s;pect the Relicts of Anti|quity, than to open the Book of Nature it &s;elf with ones own Hands, in Di&s;&s;ections of Animals, and the <HI>Materia medica,</HI> tho there be &s;omething both like Butchers and Colliers work, belonging to it. The Greate&s;t Men have done it; tho&s;e whom we are not a&s;hamed to follow as Ma&s;ters, but might with like Indu&s;try outgo, as far as they did tho&s;e that went before them. Nothing but the ba&s;e&s;t Pride can di&s;dain to u&s;e tho&s;e Hands God has given us to the be&s;t Pur|po&s;es, or think Mechanicks di&s;honourable, which the greate&s;t Per&s;ons (I may &s;ay Per&s;on) that ever appeared on the Stage of the World, di&s;dain'd not to pra|cti&s;e. But</P>
<P>A more material Objection, and indeed &s;eeming Difficulty, is this, That it is a thing too great, a Task too heavy for one man to be well skill'd in, and to perform all things belonging to the Art of Healing. To which I reply, That as it is no way di&s;honourable, but very much to a Man's Credit, to have both a Head and a Hand capable of doing whatever belongs to his Art; &s;o it is po&s;|&s;ible, and with diligence attainable. Any Boy of a Genius capable of doing any thing prai&s;e-worthy in Phy&s;ick, if he be not abus'd, may by 16 have Lan|guage
<PB N="57" REF="56">enough to read any Latin Authors, and al&s;o have made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in the <HI>Greek,</HI> which by u&s;e, and the help of Tran&s;lations which are annex'd to mo&s;t <HI>Greek</HI> Authors, he may in time compleat. As for other Languages, they are not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, there being enough in the&s;e. And in learning of the&s;e Tongues, he may have read &s;ome Books of Phy&s;iology, or na|tural Philo&s;ophy. In 8 or 9 years more &s;pent in diligent Reading, and the Pra|ctice of experimental Philo&s;ophy and Pharmacy, with the &s;ight of Ca&s;es ma|nag'd by his Teachers, he may arrive to a capacity of doing creditably &s;ome|thing of what he has &s;een others do in all the parts of Healing, if he will but have the Mode&s;ty and Hone&s;ty not to undertake all Ca&s;es rare and difficult, which many times puzzle Men of 50 years Practice. He may in that time be &s;o far expert in all that belongs to the Cure of divers Di&s;ea&s;es, as that he may ho|ne&s;tly and courageou&s;ly undertake to cure 'em. But it will &s;till be objected by tho&s;e that would be thought worthy of a large Practice, That the Pharmaceutick and Chirurgick parts of Healing cannot be attended, by rea&s;on of the many Vi&s;its the Importunity of the Sick obliges 'em to. But it may be an&s;wered, in many ca&s;es Vi&s;its are not nece&s;&s;ary, the Patients may come home to the Doctors, and take the Medicines home with them; in &s;ome they need not be &s;een &s;o oft: And be|&s;ides, an ingenious Servant, a Pupil, will quickly come to take off a great deal of the Labour and Care in Preparation and Di&s;pen&s;ation, and Conveyance of Medicines. There are &s;ome Preparations made by tho&s;e that have nothing to do in Medicine, as common Spirit of Wine, and divers others, in which there can be no con&s;iderable Deceit, which the Phy&s;ician need not trouble him&s;elf to make. But above all, if Phy&s;icians would apply them&s;elves particularly to the Cure of &s;ome few Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ome to the&s;e, &s;ome to others, they might be therein more expert, and ea&s;ily provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary for their par|ticular Practice, without tho&s;e Defects and Damages to the Sick which ari&s;e from the common Divi&s;ion of the Phy&s;icians work in every Di&s;ea&s;e, between two or three Per&s;ons, each of whom is u&s;ually unskill'd in &s;ome part of that which belongs to the Cure of any one Di&s;temper. As if &s;ome would apply them&s;elves to the Cure of all &s;orts of Fevers, others the Gout and Scorbute, others the Pox, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and would undertake nothing but what they are well provided for, they might have more bu&s;ine&s;s perhaps, or at lea&s;t enough, and more Credit, and the Patients much more Comfort. But perhaps there may be &s;ome large Souls, that can neither be contented to &s;ub&s;erve a Cly&s;ter, to &s;pill the Bal&s;am of Life by command, nor yet to be skilled in the cure of but &s;ome particular Di&s;ea&s;es; that think it little in a Phy&s;ician, if he is not <HI>omnibus numeris completus,</HI> and cannot undertake all Di&s;ea&s;es. I &s;ay to the&s;e brave Souls, if they will but &s;corn to pretend, they may by Indu&s;try arrive to a capacity of hone&s;tly profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves Catholick Phy&s;icians, provided they will not co|vet, nor undertake more Patients than they can well provide for, and by their Indu&s;try can be &s;o happy as to acquire a few effectual and Catholick Reme|dies:
<PB N="58" REF="57">And I think they may get Money enough, tho they have no Under-workmen, and being greater Credit to their Profe&s;&s;ion, and be a greater Ble&s;&s;ing to the Age and Places they live in. I will profe&s;s, as to my &s;elf, tho I refu&s;e no Ca&s;es, except Lithotomy, and &s;ome few that require Accommodations in a Phy&s;ician's Hou&s;e, I de&s;ire no more Patients than I can &s;ufficiently provide for with my own Hand and Eye, in what&s;oever belongs to inward and outward Operations: And if any &s;ingular Ca&s;e happens that I do not well &s;ee into, I can be content to con&s;ult my Friends of the Faculty for my information, not to the Patient's Charge; or refer him to any of them that he or I, or any Friend can judg more expert in the Ca&s;e: and what Money cannot be hone&s;tly and ingenuou&s;ly got, I think is too much, and a Burden that will but help to &s;ink a Man into Mi&s;ery. And a mighty Practice, tho tolerably well performed for the real good of Mankind, is but a Life of mighty Care and Perplexity, not to be de&s;ired by a wi&s;e man for his own &s;ake; but rather to be prevented by teaching the Rules of Health, communicating to other Phy&s;icians his Skill, and a mode&s;t refu&s;al of Ca&s;es he does not yet thoroughly under&s;tand.</P>
<P>But as to tho&s;e Objections that may ari&s;e again&s;t this Method of Practice, as relating to the pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;icians, Surgeons and Apothecaries in the City, and herewith to con&s;ider more directly the &s;tate of the Controver&s;y between the Doctors and Apotheca|ries; it will be &s;aid the Apothecaries are not &s;o well skill'd in Phy&s;iology, Pathology, and the u&s;e of Medicines as they &s;hould be, and &s;o are uncapable of &s;ingle Practice. I an&s;wer, It is granted of a great part of them, and it is true of many of tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Doctors; but they of both &s;orts might be capable of Practice, if they would de&s;ire Skill as much as Money. It will be likewi&s;e &s;aid, the Doctors are not skill'd in Pharmacy, Chymi&s;try or Surgery. But it is to be an&s;wered, They may be, if Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Lazine&s;s do not hinder 'em from doing their Duty. But it cannot be denied that &s;ome of the Apo|thecaries are as well skill'd in all the&s;e things, and &s;o as fit to practi&s;e as &s;ome of the Do|ctors their Antagoni&s;ts, yea even of the Di&s;pen&s;ary-men who &s;well &s;o magi&s;terially. Had not &s;ome of them as mean Education as any? Were not &s;ome of them bred Apothecaries, or le&s;s to the purpo&s;e? Was not the very <HI>Acetabulum</HI> of the College bred to very little Language, hardly a clean <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man, under a Country Apothecary, who, he him&s;elf &s;ays, was very little skill'd even in his own Profe&s;&s;ion? Can a Licen&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed to in&s;pire with Suf|ficiency in an in&s;tant? Or can another, bred a mere Scholar, uncapable of Divine Prefer|ment by Jacobiti&s;m, undetermin'd to Phy&s;ick, of a &s;udden become a Doctor by a Univer&s;i|ty Patent, and a compleat Arti&s;t in the Medicinal Faculty, with whom a Man of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year may tru&s;t his Life and precious Enjoyments? I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never got any Skill on a &s;udden by &s;uch In&s;pirations. I remember what <HI>Per&s;ius</HI> &s;ays as to Poetry;</P>
<LG>

<P>So &s;ay I as to Phy&s;ick,</P>
<LG>
<L>I know not when, &s;leeping in <HI>Phebus</HI> Beams,</L>
<L>My heated Pate was fill'd with Phy&s;ick Dreams;</L>
<L>So that I waking found my &s;elf a Man,</L>
<L>In&s;pir'd with Skill, a good Phy&s;ician.</L>
</LG>
<P>But the hone&s;t Part of the College, as they call them&s;elves, have &s;et up Shops, where Medicines &s;hall be well and hone&s;tly prepared, and tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs that have aro&s;e from tru&s;ting Apothecaries avoided; and &s;o the Method propo&s;ed, is to them needle&s;s. I an|&s;wer, it mu&s;t here be confe&s;s'd, that they are &s;o far commendable, as that they owning &s;ome of the Faults they have been guilty of, profe&s;s to do &s;omething better. But what they do will not be enough; they are not yet well skilled in Pharmacy, e&s;pecially the chief Part of it, Pyrotechny; their Servants are not better skill'd than the Apothecaries, nor can they have that Care of the Succe&s;s of their Ma&s;ters Practice, as a Man would of
<PB N="59" REF="58">his own: the Blame will not lie upon them, the Ma&s;ters don't always &s;ee what they do, nor can they always teach them what they &s;hould do. Neither Ma&s;ters nor Servants have affur'd the People of more Skill or Hone&s;ty than in the old way. But if any of them were real Arti&s;ts, and had any great things, they would not communicate them; but if they u&s;ed them, mu&s;t &s;o far act &s;ingly according to our Method. But the Force of the Objection again&s;t the Method I propo&s;e, lies in this; That con&s;idering the Doctors and A|pothecaries are &s;ingly defective in not under&s;tanding the whole that belongs to the Art of Healing, they mu&s;t practi&s;e &s;ome way or other dependently, or not at all; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d if the greate&s;t Part &s;hould leave off Practice, 1. How &s;hould they live? 2. How &s;hall the People be &s;upplied in their Nece&s;&s;ities? I an&s;wer, many of them have got enough al|ready, and may very well leave off, and take Care of &s;ecuring their own Health in ano|ther Life by Repentance, or refu&s;e to undertake what they cannot do as they &s;hould, till they can do their Duty. But tho&s;e that have not already laid up of the Mammon of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, had better leave off quite, and take to &s;omething they can more hone&s;t|ly perform, than abu&s;e their Neighbours, and ruin their own Souls. They can have no better Plea to continue in an evil Practice, than Bauds and Whores, who have not been bred to any other Employment. But as to the other Plea, how the People &s;hall be &s;erved; I an&s;wer, it is a que&s;tion, whether the pre&s;ent dependent Practice of Phy&s;ick, taking one time with another, does more hurt or good; and to try the Experiment by leaving off Phy&s;ick for 4 or 5 Years, till &s;ome ingenious Men were better accompli&s;hed, perhaps might be worth the People's while. But there are &s;ome that follow our Method, and have always done &s;o, who might be more u&s;eful than &s;ome of them are, were the magi&s;te|rial and haughty way of Practice by Pre&s;cribing out of reque&s;t, and were the Practitio|ners by Patent no way able to per&s;ecute or mole&s;t tho&s;e that are mo&s;t capable of doing the Phy&s;ician's Duty. But it will &s;till be replied, it will &s;ignify but little to per&s;uade Men again&s;t their Intere&s;t, the thing which all Men &s;o vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecute. I an&s;wer, if what I have &s;aid be not &s;ufficient to per&s;uade Phy&s;icians, that it is their Intere&s;t to be hone&s;t, and well accompli&s;hed in their Profe&s;&s;ion, I would leave them, and addre&s;s my &s;elf to the &s;uffering People, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that govern, and propo&s;e to them two ways whereby Phy&s;icians might be excellently accompli&s;hed for their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o more profitable to the People: for pre&s;uppo&s;ing the Per&s;ons be &s;ufficiently accompli&s;hed in Lan|guages, and to have a Genius to Philo&s;ophical and Medicinal Studies, or not to be admitted, they &s;hould either &s;erve, not ignorant Apothecaries or Doctors, but able independent Phy&s;icians as their Pupils, faithfully to be in&s;tructed a &s;ufficient Number of Years, on proper Conditions; as Medicine was taught of old. Or 2ly. That there &s;hall be erected at <HI>London</HI> a School of Medicine, wherein &s;hall always be a &s;ufficient Number of skilful Practitioners of all Parts of Medicine, who &s;hould not only theoretically, but practically teach the Pupils all things that belong to the Profe&s;&s;ion: and none &s;hould be &s;uffered to practi&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> but &s;uch as being fit for Admi&s;&s;ion had gone through all things belong|ing to the Art, by continuance in this School &s;o many Years, as &s;hould be thought, or ra|ther found &s;ufficient to qualify them. Which of the&s;e two Methods would be the be&s;t, I &s;hall not now determine: either might be preferred in different re&s;pects. The la&s;t perhaps would be mo&s;t liked, as &s;eeming mo&s;t honourable; the former might by an able Ma&s;ter be more ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed, and both very well agree with what <HI>Hippocrates</HI> propo&s;es <HI>in Lege.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,

<HEAD>Remarks upon Dr. <HI>P</HI>'s late Bill, and his Po&s;t&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>P.</HI> the Scribe to the Company of Traders, that call them&s;elves the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary,</HI> or Dr. Apothecaries, in his late Bill of Sale, hath the&s;e few things remarkable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That he dedicates it, and addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the Pagan God <HI>Termi|nus.</HI> Whom whether he hath cho&s;en his peculiar Deity, as mo&s;t likely to ter|minate the Money of the Sick at the Di&s;pen&s;ary, I &s;hall not determine, or whether his Religion is Pagan, Chri&s;tian, Medical, or Compo&s;ita.</P>
<P N="2">2. He &s;ays nothing in it more to his purpo&s;e, than what he &s;aid in his other Bills.</P>
<P N="3">3. His de&s;ign (apparent in them all) is to get Patients, Cu&s;tomers, and thereby Money. It cannot be &s;uppos'd that 46 Leeches in our corrupt Times &s;hould combine to carry on the Trade, merely for the Publick Good.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Means he &s;till u&s;es is no more than all Quacks u&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to cry up them&s;elves, their Skill, and Hone&s;ty, and the goodne&s;s and cheapne&s;s of their Remedies, their <HI>No&s;trums</HI> and <HI>Arcanas,</HI> and to tell of their great Practice, and at the &s;ame time to decry others.</P>
<P N="5">5. That to catch much Fi&s;h 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to continue ca&s;ting the Net, one impre&s;&s;ion of Bills will never bring in a Trade.</P>
<P N="6">6. That he &s;ells his Bills (contrary to the charitable Cu&s;tom of other Quacks who give them <HI>gratis</HI>) the &s;horte&s;t of which at a penny a piece, may rob the People of above 4 <HI>l.</HI> more than the intrin&s;ick Value.</P>
<P N="7">7. That if the College be the &s;tandard of what is creditable in Phy&s;icians, 'tis now no &s;hame to put out Bills to get Patients.</P>
<P N="8">8. That he has &s;pent &s;even lines of his half Sheet in a Po&s;t&s;cript in an&s;wer to the Author of <HI>Bellum Medicinale;</HI> in which he accu&s;es him,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>of pro&s;ing an odd Method of bringing Phy&s;ick and Surgery together.</HI> To which he replys;</P>
<P>That the odne&s;s of the Method is no Argument again&s;t the goodne&s;s and nece&s;|&s;ity thereof: but his Method was not only to bring Phy&s;ick and Surgery toge|ther, but to add Pharmacy al&s;o to them as a third thing, without which the Healer can't be his Crafts-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="2">2. He accu&s;es him, <HI>That he hath expos'd all the Doctors and Apothecaries.</HI> To which he replys;</P>
<P>That his Accu&s;er hereby owns that they are capable of being expos'd, but he never de&s;ign'd to expo&s;e, or thinks he has expos'd any of either Party but tho&s;e that de&s;erve it; and if any particular Per&s;on thinks him&s;elf touch'd, 'tis the Application makes the A&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>For u&s;ing Chymical Medicines only.</HI> But he replys;</P>
<PB N="62" REF="61">
<P>That he never profe&s;s'd to do &s;o in his Book, or otherwi&s;e, but thinks him no very wi&s;e Man that &s;hall &s;pend Time, Labour, and Money on any Chymical Preparation, where a more ea&s;ily preparable Medicine will do as well, whether Specifick, or other: But yet thinks it very well worth his while to work &s;ome even tedious, Chymical Preparations, knowing that there are Effects in healing to be wrought by Chymical Medicines, which no crude Simples, or Com|pounds have ever been found &s;ufficient for. But,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He &s;ays he is no Chymi&s;t, not knowing that</HI> Aqua Regis <HI>di&s;&s;olves Gold only from the Spirit of Salt in the</HI> Sal Armoniack. But he excu&s;es him, That <HI>the Experiment may be too co&s;tly for him.</HI> To which he an&s;wers, If he that does not know that <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> di&s;&s;olves Gold only from the Spirit of Salt in the <HI>Sal Armon.</HI> is no Chymi&s;t, then Dr. <HI>P.</HI> is the Man by his own Argument will be proved to be no Chymi&s;t; for that which is not true, is not known to be &s;o: but it is not true that <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> di&s;&s;olves Gold only from the Spirit of Salt in the <HI>Sal Armoniac;</HI> for all that know the Nature and U&s;es of Spirit of Salt, know it is no apt <HI>Men&s;trum</HI> to di&s;&s;olve Gold, without the a&s;&s;ociation of Spirit of Niter, which of it &s;elf will not do it, but by both in conjunction it is rea|dily done; but the Spirit of Niter being the greate&s;t part of the Di&s;&s;olvent, has undoubtedly the greate&s;t &s;hare in the action; &s;o it can't be only from that Part which of it &s;elf, or only is not &s;ufficient. Whatever will not do alone, can never be the <HI>only</HI> thing that does. But &s;uppo&s;e Dr. <HI>P.</HI> &s;hould be told that tho there is materially, yet there is formally no Spirit of Salt in <HI>Sal Armoniac;</HI> that Salt is not Spirit of Salt; and that he never &s;aw a true Spirit of Salt in his Life: I don't know how he would be able to make out the contrary. But the Author of <HI>Bellum Medicinale,</HI> to prove again&s;t the Doctor the Action or Pa&s;&s;ion of an animal Sub&s;tance with Gold, did not &s;ay, That common Salt is properly an Animal Sub&s;tance (tho it is hardly ever wanting in Man's Body) or that the Volatile Salt in the <HI>Sal Armoniac</HI> was the efficient of the Solution of Gold in <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> (whatever it may confer towards the effect) but added what the Doctor did not care to take notice of in his Po&s;tcript, <HI>viz.</HI> That Spirit of Urin (which certainly is an Animal Sub&s;tance) precipitates the di&s;&s;olved Gold into <HI>Aurum F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lminans;</HI> in which Operation the Spirit of Urin has without all doubt &s;ome Action or Pa&s;&s;ion with Gold, the Calx of Gold made only with <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> having no fulminating Property.</P>
<P>As for the co&s;tline&s;s of the Experiment, <HI>Whether the Spirit of Salt only di&s;&s;olves Gold in Aqua Regis:</HI> If the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es 8 or 900 Guineas mu&s;t be &s;pent, or that the Gold mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved by Pounds, it is confe&s;s'd the Experiment might be &s;o co&s;tly; 'twere better being ignorant in the Matter, and skil'd only in &s;ome &s;light, whereby one might finger &s;o much of the Metal. But the Doctor I mu&s;t needs &s;ay talks here as if he were no Chymi&s;t, and could never &s;pare his
<PB N="63" REF="62">Gold to make the Trial, for Chymi&s;ts know how to reduce their Gold again with very little lo&s;s. But farther, I will engage to teach any Man how he may make <HI>ten</HI> Experiments of this Matter for <HI>five</HI> Pence charge, tho he &s;hould not recover the Gold u&s;ed in the tryal. But the</P>
<P>Fifth and la&s;t thing laid to the Charge of the Author of <HI>Bellum Medicinale,</HI> is,</P>
<P><HI>That in his Po&s;t&s;cript he makes the Dotor's Sum</HI> 870 l. <HI>too much, and probably</HI> 40 <HI>or</HI> 50 l.<HI>concluded the Apothecary's Bill.</HI> To which he an&s;wers; He will tell the Doctor a Story, and &s;o leave him.</P>
<P>There was a Gentleman on a time travelling on the Rode, and he fell among Thieves who rob'd him, as he te&s;tified before a Ju&s;tice, of 1317 <HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> But whereas he was fooli&s;hly decoy'd into their hands, and very cowardly &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be rob'd by Per&s;ons not &s;o well arm'd as him&s;elf, he was a&s;ham'd (like a Man cheated by an Alchymi&s;t, or a Whore) to pro&s;ecute the Felons; and &s;o never &s;tir'd in the matter, or &s;ought to apprehend them. But after &s;ome time it happen'd that they were di&s;cover'd by another Per&s;on (hating Villany) and accus'd of the Theft; but when they came to an&s;wer for them&s;elves, they pleaded that they were very Hone&s;t Men, and were abus'd by their Accu&s;er, for they took but 147 <HI>l.</HI> from the Gentleman. You &s;illy Rogues, &s;ays the Judg, you have condemn'd your &s;elves by acknowledging the Fact, and a Robbery great enough, there is now no need of farther Evidence, or of the Gentleman's Te&s;ti|mony for the larger Sum: Yet if he can be prevail'd with to appear again&s;t you, the Fact &s;hall be made out in all its Circum&s;tances to your greater &s;hame. But what you own you took is enough to make you Rogues that de&s;erve to be hanged with other Villains; God give you Repentance, and &s;o Lord have Mercy upon you. But,</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>The Cheater under Friend&s;hip's Gui&s;e is wor&s;e</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than he that bids me &s;tand, and give my Pur&s;e.</HI></L>
<L><HI>This Hero plainly tells me what he'd have,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And gives me leave to fight, my Coin to &s;ave:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Again&s;t the other I have no defence,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The &s;neaking Rogue hides under feign'd Pretence.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Perhaps he frights me with &s;uppos'd Di&s;ea&s;e</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Embryo, &s;wears he &s;eeks my Health and Ea&s;e</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pretends to purge the latent Matter forth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>While he imbezles Strength and Money both;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And brings me down unto a tabid State,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then A&s;&s;es Milk pre&s;cribes to make me fat:</HI></L>
<L><HI>When rais'd again, the Humours reabound,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then I'm advis'd to take another round.</HI></L>
<L><HI>This is my Doctor's friendly Di&s;cipline,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I lo&s;e my Strength and Health, he gets my Coin.</HI></L>
