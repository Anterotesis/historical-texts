<HEAD>THE CURIOSITIES OF Common Water.</HEAD>
<P>_FOR the Benefit of Mankind in general, I have taken pains to give the World an Account of what I have found written in the Works of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians concerning the Good that Mankind may receive from the U&s;e of Common Water, and of the Informations I have had con|cerning
<PB N="4" REF="3">the Benefits thereof from others by word of mouth; and of what I have di&s;cover'd by my own Experience from frequent Tryals during a time that hath intervened from that of thirty to &s;eventy four Years of Age: which is &s;ufficient to confirm the &s;tupendous Effects thereof in many Particulars, that &s;hall be mentioned as my own Di&s;covery with re&s;pect to this excellent Remedy, which will perform Cures with very little Trouble, and with|out any Charge, and is al&s;o to be had wherever there are any Habitations, which is what can hardly be &s;aid of any o|ther thing: &s;o that in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, Water may truly be &s;tiled <HI>An Univer&s;al Reme|dy,</HI> &s;ince the Di&s;ea&s;es it either prevents or cures may have this Remedy applied to all Per&s;ons, and in all Places where Men do inhabit.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Commendation of Common Water that I &s;hall mention, is that which is written concerning it by Dr. <HI>Manwa|ring,</HI> in his <HI>Method and Means of enjoy|ing Health;</HI> wherein he &s;aith, that Wa|ter is a whole&s;ome Drink, or rather the mo&s;t whole&s;ome&mdash;being appointed for Man in his be&s;t State: which doth &s;trong|ly argue that Drink to be the mo&s;t &s;uit|able for human Nature&mdash;an&s;wering all the Intentions of common Drinks, for it
<PB N="5" REF="4">cools, moi&s;tens and quencheth Thir&s;t; 'tis clear, thin, and fit to convey the Nouri&s;h|ment through the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els of the Body&mdash;and is a Drink that is a Rule to it&s;elf, and requires little Caution in the U&s;e of it, &s;ince none will be tempted to drink of it more than needs: And that in the Primitive Ages of the World, Wa|ter-Drinkers, he &s;ays, were the longe&s;t Livers by &s;ome Hundreds of Years&mdash; nor &s;o often &s;ick and complaining, as we are.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Keill,</HI> when he treats concerning the Stomach, in his <HI>Abridgment of the Anatomy of Human Bodies,</HI> &s;aith, that Water &s;eems the fitte&s;t to promote Di|ge&s;tion of the Food which we eat; all &s;pirituous Liquors having a Property by which they hurt, rather than help Di|ge&s;tion; the &s;ad Effects of which they are &s;en&s;ible of, he &s;aith, who by a long u&s;e thereof have lo&s;t their Appetite, hard|ly ever to be re&s;tored without drinking Water, which &s;eldom faileth of procuring a good Appetite and a &s;trong Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Prat,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Mineral Water,</HI> &s;hews it to be his Judgment, that if People would accu&s;tom them&s;elves to drink Water, they would be more free from many Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;uch as <HI>Tremblings,
<PB N="6" REF="5">Pal&s;ies, Apoplexies, Giddine&s;s, Pains in the Head, Gout, Stone, Drop&s;y, Rheuma|ti&s;m, Piles, and &s;uch like:</HI> Which Di&s;|ea&s;es are mo&s;t common among them that drink &s;trong Drinks, and which Water generally would prevent. Moreover, he al&s;o &s;aith, that Water plentifully drank <HI>&s;trengthens the Stomach, cau&s;eth an Ap|petite, pre&s;erves the Sight, maketh the Sen&s;es lively, and clean&s;eth all the Pa&s;|&s;ages of the Body,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Kidneys and Bladder.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid al&s;o by Dr. <HI>Duncan,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of hot Liquors,</HI> that when Men contented them&s;elves with Water, they had more Health and Strength; and that at this day tho&s;e who drink nothing but Water, are more healthy, and live longer than tho&s;e who drink &s;trong Liquors, <HI>which rai&s;es the Heat of the Stomach to Exce&s;s, whereas Water keeps it in a due Temper.</HI> And he adds in another part of the Book, that by hot Liquors the Blood is inflamed; and &s;uch who&s;e Blood is in|flamed, live not &s;o long as tho&s;e who are of a cooler Temper: <HI>a hot Blood being commonly the Cau&s;e of Fluxes, Rheums, ill Dige&s;tion, Pains in the Limbs, Head|ach, Dimne&s;s of Sight,</HI> and e&s;pecially of <HI>Hy&s;teric Vapours.</HI> He al&s;o imputes the Cau&s;e of Ulcers to a hot Blood, and de|clares,
<PB N="7" REF="6">that if Men kept their Blood cool and &s;weet, <HI>by a moderate cooling Diet,</HI> they would never be troubled with Ul|cers, or other Breakings out.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Floyer</HI> al&s;o, in the Preface to his <HI>Treati&s;e of Cold Baths,</HI> does affirm, that Vapours both in Men and Women are cau&s;ed by hot things, and that <HI>by leaving off &s;trong Liquors and a hot Diet, and by drinking Water,</HI> he had procured to him&s;elf a better Health, and more Hardine&s;s, than he had enjoyed for many Years. And in the Body of that Book he affirmeth, that drinking of Water in the Morning, <HI>cools the Blood, prevents Defluxions, and wa&s;hes off the bilious and &s;alt Recrements by Urine;</HI> and that drinking Water after Dinner, <HI>cools and &s;tops the too high Fermentation of the Stomach,</HI> which is the Cau&s;e of breeding Wind or Belching after Meat: to the Truth of which, the Author of this Ac|count can bear a full Te&s;timony, who being for many Years afflicted with this belching up of Wind after Meat, did at length prevent the &s;ame, by drinking Water after eating, in&s;tead of other Drink, which in time did cool that <HI>Hypochon|driack Heat,</HI> from whence tho&s;e Belchings did proceed.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>Having read over an old Book written by one Sir <HI>Tho. Eliot,</HI> entitled, <HI>The Ca|&s;tle of Health,</HI> he there declared from his own Experience, that in the County of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> tho it was a very cold Quar|ter, the Poorer Sort, which in his time did never, or but very &s;eldom drink any other Drinks but Water, were &s;trong of Body, and lived to a very great Age; to which Relation that of Sir <HI>Henry Blount</HI> is very agreeable who affirmed, in his <HI>Book of Travels into the</HI> Levant, (where under the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Government the U&s;e of Wine was forbid, <HI>and where the com|mon Drink is Water</HI>) that he then had a better Stomach to his Food, and dige&s;ted it more kindly than he ever did before or &s;ince.</P>
<P>And in the Treati&s;e of the <HI>Vanity of Philo&s;ophy,</HI> written by Dr. <HI>Gideon Har|vey,</HI> it is affirmed by him, that it is not Heat that cau&s;eth a good Dige&s;tion, <HI>but a proper Ferment or Liquor provided by Nature,</HI> to di&s;&s;olve the Food into a Sub|&s;tance like unto Pap made with fine Flower: which Di&s;&s;olvent, he &s;aith, is much depraved by hot &s;pirituous Liquors, and therefore he commends Water above all other Drinks to promote Dige&s;tion.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>Water-drinking is al&s;o &s;aid by Dr. <HI>Al|len</HI> to be good to prevent two deplorable Di&s;tempers, <HI>the Gout and the Hypochon|driack Melancholy;</HI> for, &s;ays he, the Gout is generally cau&s;ed by the too great drink|ing of fermented Liquors, <HI>and is never &s;aid to have a&s;&s;aulted any Drinker of Water;</HI> and he &s;aith al&s;o, that <HI>Melan|choly Hypochondriack</HI> is kept off longe&s;t by drinking Water in&s;tead of &s;trong Drink. To which let me add, that I once knew a gouty Gentleman, who, to avoid his drinking Companions in <HI>London,</HI> re|tired to <HI>New Brentford,</HI> where I then lived; in which Town, by a very tempe|rate Diet of one Meal a day, and drink|ing only Water, he lived two whole Years free from Pain: but being vi&s;ited by one who came that way, and invited to drink but one Bottle of Claret between them, he fell next day into a terrible Fit of the Gout, which held above a Month after; of which being recover'd, he by the &s;ame Cour&s;e continued well till I left the Place, which was about a Year and a half after.</P>
<P>The good Properties of Water are fur|ther manife&s;ted in preventing the breed|ing of Gravel in the Kidneys; for <HI>Zechias,</HI> in <HI>Con&s;ult.</HI> 17. as he is quoted by <HI>Salmon,</HI> affirms, that nothing doth &s;o much abate
<PB N="10" REF="9">the Heat of the Kidneys, and free them from tho&s;e Recrements which cau&s;e Pain in the Back, <HI>one great &s;ign of Gravel,</HI> as Water does: but he advi&s;eth to drink it warm, by the U&s;e of which, he &s;aith, the unnatural Heat in time will be &s;o extin|gui&s;hed, that no more of that Matter cau&s;ing Gravel will be produced in the Body. Which A&s;&s;ertion, by Experience I have found to be true: for ob&s;erv|ing much Gravel to be voided by me, as al&s;o abundance of Matter floating in the Urine like Bran, with a great number of Recrements like Cuttings of Hair, &s;ome above an Inch long; <HI>which Sub&s;tances were found in all the Water I made in above twelve Months;</HI> for which I could get no Remedy: I was advi&s;ed to drink Water, which in about half a Year did entirely free me from tho&s;e Symp|toms which &s;ome imputed to Witchcraft out of Ignorance; &s;o that from that time to this pre&s;ent I never have been troubled with it.</P>
<P>Water al&s;o is commended as efficacious to prevent the breeding of the Stone in the Bladder, for it hath been ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome who have been cut for the Stone, that new Stones have been ingen|der'd, &s;o that &s;ome young Per&s;ons have been cut &s;everal times. Now to prevent
<PB N="11" REF="10">this, the drinking Water hath been ad|vi&s;ed with Succe&s;s; for by this that in|temperate Heat in the Body was abated, which did occa&s;ion the Di&s;temper. Some have advi&s;ed to drink it warm, and others cold, and in particular <HI>Van Heydon,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Ghent</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in his Book, entitled, <HI>Help for the Rich and Poor;</HI> which he &s;aith, in <HI>p.</HI> 49. is &s;uffi|ciently in&s;inuated by <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> who do a&s;&s;ure us, that the taking a Draught of cold Water in the Morning, hath done &s;o much good, that &s;everal af|ter the voiding of a Stone never had any more Stones grow in them.</P>
<P>Which Experiment may give light to the Di&s;covery of a way to cure the Stone without cutting; for if the growing of new Stones can be prevented by drinking Water, let it be hot or cold, <HI>it may pre|vent a Stone from growing bigger when begun;</HI> and if the aiding Matter to in|crea&s;e a Stone new begun, can be pre|vented, Nature in time may wa&s;te that which is begun, e&s;pecially if &s;ome Drops of &s;weet Spirit of Nitre be added to all the Water drank, which will powerfully help to cool, and is known to be an ad|mirable Mover or Provoker of Urine, and will wa&s;te a Stone, and make it crumble like Fullers Earth, if applied to a Stone
<PB N="12" REF="11">taken from the Body. Or the Water may be &s;weeten'd with Honey, which is now much in u&s;e among the Gentry, as I am informed by an ingenious Apothecary; who told me, that among them at pre&s;ent Pump-Water and Honey was in great re|pute to give ea&s;e in Gravel: and there is &s;o near an Affinity between Gravel and the Stone, that what is proper for one, will be &s;uitable to both, and will prevent the growing of both.</P>
<P>Water is al&s;o &s;tiled in <HI>Sennertus</HI>'s <HI>Works</HI> the Bal&s;am of Children, the drinking of it by the Mother being one of tho&s;e things whereby Children may be &s;trengthen'd in the Womb, and will prevent tho&s;e In|juries that are done them by drinking &s;trong Liquors; which <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s Mother was not allowed to do, for &s;he was com|manded <HI>not to drink Wine or &s;trong Drink,</HI> Judg. 13.4. But I will not &s;ay, if all Women &s;hould do this, their Chil|dren &s;hall be as &s;trong as <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> was; yet this I will &s;ay, if they would do this, they would find their Children more free from Di&s;temper and Frowardne&s;s, and &s;o much more ea&s;y to nur&s;e and bring up, and be le&s;s liable to an immature Death; the want of which Ab&s;tinence from &s;trong Drinks is the Cau&s;e why &s;o many rich People find it hard to bring up Children,
<PB N="13" REF="12">in compari&s;on to what is done by the Poor: for the&s;e la&s;t are born of Mothers, who not only are prevented from being Gluttons by their want of <HI>Dainties, which are deceitful Meat,</HI> Prov. 23.3. but they &s;eldom ta&s;te Wine or &s;trong Drink: whereas the Rich not only feed high, and &s;o engender foul Blood, but they al&s;o drink &s;trong Drinks, which in mo&s;t Con&s;titutions do over-heat the Hu|mours of the Body, and that Blood by which their Children are nouri&s;hed du|ring their Pregnancy. Which Injury to unborn Infants would be prevented, if the Mother would be temperate in Diet, and drink Water, e&s;pecially at Meals, by which the Blood of the Mother would be kept cool and clean; which mu&s;t needs communicate a healthful Sub&s;tance to the Child within her, and prevent all tho&s;e Di&s;tempers which Infants do bring with them into the World.</P>
<P>And here it may be proper to add, <HI>what by divers Experiments hath been found to be true,</HI> that the drinking Water by Nur&s;es while they give &s;uck to Chil|dren, will wonderfully increa&s;e Milk in tho&s;e that want it, <HI>as every one will find,</HI> who can be per&s;uaded to make u&s;e there|of. I have advi&s;ed many to make u&s;e of it, who have found that by drinking a
<PB N="14" REF="13">large Draught of Water at Bed-time, they have been &s;upplied with Milk &s;uf|ficient for that Night, when before they wanted it, and could not be &s;upplied by any other means: And be&s;ides, they who have found their Children re&s;tle&s;s by rea&s;on of too much Heat in their Milk, do find them much more quiet after their Milk is cooled by Water-drinking.</P>
<P>By drinking Water al&s;o, the want of Food for a time may be &s;uffered without &s;tarving; for I have been informed by a credible Friend, who was an Officer at Sea, that being &s;ent down to <HI>Stafford</HI> to take care to &s;ee &s;ome Men conveyed on Ship-board, that had deen pre&s;s'd by Act of Parliament for the Sea-Service; he found in the Pri&s;on, <HI>where they were kept,</HI> a lu&s;ty Fellow, who had declared he would &s;tarve him&s;elf rather than go to Sea, and taking particular notice there|of, he found upon due Enquiry, that for twenty days he had refu&s;ed to eat any manner of Food, <HI>only he drank each day about three Pints or two Quarts of Wa|ter,</HI> hoping thereby to get him&s;elf di&s;|charged: but when he found his Preten|&s;ions to be in vain, and that in about two days they &s;hould all march for <HI>London,</HI> he conde&s;cended to eat &s;ome Food, begin|ning with a little, and in the March he
<PB N="15" REF="14">was ob&s;erved to travel as well as the be&s;t Man. I find al&s;o an Account in Dr. <HI>Car</HI>'s <HI>Letters,</HI> of a certain crack-brain'd Man, who, at <HI>Leyden,</HI> when the Doctor re&s;ided in that Univer&s;ity, pretended he could fa&s;t as long as Chri&s;t did; and it was found that he held out the time of forty Days without eating any Food, only he drank Water and &s;moak'd Tobacco. And I once had a &s;ad Complaint from a poor old Woman of the Greatne&s;s of her Want, affirming that oftentimes &s;he had not ea|ten any Food for two or three days; upon which I asked her, if &s;he did not then &s;uffer much Unea&s;ine&s;s in her Stomach: &s;he &s;aid &s;he did, but found a way at la&s;t to a&s;&s;uage her Hunger, by drinking Wa|ter, which did &s;atisfy her Appetite.</P>
<P>Water is al&s;o of great u&s;e to &s;trengthen weak Children, for we are informed by Dr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Browne,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Cures performed by Cold Baths,</HI> that the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Women do pre&s;erve their Children from the Rickets, by wa&s;hing them Night and Morning in cold Water, till they are three quarters of a Year old, <HI>p.</HI> 79. And 'tis &s;aid by Sir <HI>John Floyer,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Cold Baths,</HI> that a La|dy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had lo&s;t &s;everal Chil|dren through Weakne&s;s, <HI>did by the Ad|vice
<PB N="16" REF="15">of a Highland Beggar-Woman</HI> pre|&s;erve tho&s;e &s;he had afterwards, by wa&s;h|ing them daily in cold Water. And I my|&s;elf did advi&s;e a Neighbour, who&s;e Child began to be ricketty, to treat the Child in the &s;ame manner; but &s;he, in&s;tead of wa&s;hing, dipt it over head and ears every Morning, <HI>it being then in the Summer|time:</HI> the Event of which was, the Child became &s;trong, and had a good Counte|nance, tho before it was in the Face very pale and wan. Which &s;hews how great the Power of Water is, when u&s;ed out|wardly, to invigorate the Spirits, and &s;trengthen Nature.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a known Cu&s;tom, to prevent the Swellings that follow Brui&s;es in the Faces of Children, by immediately ap|plying thereunto a Linnen Cloth four or &s;ix times double, dipt in cold Water, and new dipping it as it begins to grow warm; for the Cold repels or prevents the flow|ing of Humours to the Part, which other|wi&s;e would cau&s;e great Swelling, and after turn blacki&s;h: and if upon neglecting to do &s;o, a Swelling &s;hould &s;ucceed, it may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by fomenting Night and Morn|ing, for an hour at a time, with Water as hot as can be endured; for that will give vent to the Humours to tran&s;pire
<PB N="17" REF="16">through the Skin, or di&s;&s;olve them, &s;o as to make them capable of returning back.</P>
<P>Moreover, by means of Water all Sickne&s;s at the Stomach may be cured, which is done thus: Take four Quarts of Water, make it as hot over the Fire as you can drink it; of which Water let a Quart be taken down at &s;everal Draughts; <HI>then wrap a Rag round a &s;mall Piece of a Stick, till it is about the Bigne&s;s of a Man's Thumb,</HI> tie it fa&s;t with &s;ome Thread; and with this, by endeavouring gently to put it a little way down your Throat, provoke your&s;elf to vomit up again mo&s;t of the Water: then drink another Quart, and vomit up that, and repeat the &s;ame the third and fourth time. You may al|&s;o provoke Vomiting by tickling your Throat with your Finger, or the Feather-End of a Goo&s;e-Quill; <HI>but the Cloth round a Skuer maketh one vomit with mo&s;t ea&s;e,</HI> which is done with no Trou|ble when the Stomach is full. And by this way of Vomiting, <HI>which will be all performed in an hour's time,</HI> that vitious and ropy Phlegm in the Stomach, which cau&s;eth the Sickne&s;s, will be ca&s;t up, &s;o that the Party in that time will be free from all that inward Di&s;turbance, <HI>if you u&s;e the Remedy at the fir&s;t;</HI> but if the Sickne&s;s hath continued for a time, it
<PB N="18" REF="17">will require the &s;ame Cour&s;e once or twice more, which may be done in three or four Hours, one after another, with|out any other Inconvenience, <HI>be&s;ides that of being a little &s;ore in the Brea&s;t the next Day,</HI> which will &s;oon go off by the Force of Nature. Which Remedy, by forty Years Experience, I look upon to be infallible <HI>in all Sickne&s;s at the Sto|mach from what Cau&s;e &s;oever, and for all Pains in the Belly which &s;eem to be above the Navel;</HI> for the&s;e are all in the Stomach, as by long Experience I have found: which Pains are generally counted the Cholick; <HI>but it is not &s;o,</HI> for true Cholicks are always below the Navel, in the <HI>Gut, Colon.</HI> And by this means I have ea&s;ed very great Pains cau&s;ed by eating Mu&s;&s;els that were poi&s;onous; and it is al&s;o a certain Cure for all Surfeits or Di&s;|orders that follow after much eating; &s;o that the Lives of Multitudes might be &s;aved by this means, who for want of expelling what offends, do often die in Mi&s;ery: For by thus clean&s;ing the Sto|mach at the fir&s;t, the Root of Di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from Surfeiting, unwhole&s;ome Food, or any vi&s;cous Humours from a bad Dige&s;tion, are prevented; <HI>the Sto|mach being the Place in which all Di&s;|tempers do at fir&s;t begin.</HI> No Man was more &s;ubject to Sickne&s;s than my&s;elf be|fore
<PB N="19" REF="18">thirty Years of Age; but &s;ince I found out the way of vomiting with Water, <HI>which is now above forty Years,</HI> I never have been &s;ick for two Days together: for when I find my&s;elf ill to any great degree, I betake my&s;elf to this way of vomiting, <HI>which in an hour's time re|&s;tores me to Ea&s;e, and perfectly removes my Illne&s;s;</HI> and the &s;ame Benefit all my Family find in it, as do others al&s;o whom I can per&s;uade to try the Experiment; which is &s;uch, <HI>that no Phy&s;ician what|ever can advi&s;e a better to the King him&s;elf, &s;hould he fall &s;ick.</HI> For, in the fir&s;t place, 'tis not a nau&s;eous Remedy, it does not make the Patient &s;ick, as the be&s;t of all other Vomits do; and then 'tis a Vomit which is at our own Com|mand, &s;ince we can leave off when we plea&s;e: and it infallibly works a Cure to all &s;ick Stomachs.</P>
<P>Some few indeed pretend they are not able to vomit by this means; now if they cannot vomit, let them take a Pint of Water when they find them&s;elves ill from eating, and do &s;o every three or four Hours, eating no more till they are hungry; and they will find the Water di|ge&s;t and carry off what was offen&s;ive. The ingenious Dr. <HI>Cheyne,</HI> in his <HI>Trea|ti&s;e of the Gout,</HI> doth affirm that warm
<PB N="20" REF="19">Water drank freely in a Morning fa&s;ting, and at Meals, (<HI>and I &s;ay cold Water is as good</HI>) hath been a &s;overeign Remedy <HI>for re&s;toring lo&s;t Appetites, and &s;trengthen|ing weak Dige&s;tions, when other more pompous Medicines have failed.</HI> And he advi&s;eth Gouty Per&s;ons, after Exce&s;s either in Meat or Drink, <HI>to &s;will down as much fair Water as their Stomach will bear,</HI> before they go to bed, where|by they will reap the&s;e Advantages, <HI>ei|ther the Contents of the Stomach will be thrown up,</HI> or both Meat and Drink will be much diluted, and the Labour and Ex|pence of Spirits in Dige&s;tion much &s;aved. And indeed I have found by long Expe|rience, that nothing cau&s;eth &s;o good a Di|ge&s;tion as fair Water; but this requires time to free us from the Unea&s;ine&s;s that an ill Dige&s;tion cau&s;eth, whereas Vomiting is an immediate Remedy, and frees a Man from it upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>We are told by Sir <HI>John Floyer,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Bath and Mineral Springs,</HI> that Vomiting with Water is very u&s;eful <HI>in the Gout, Sciatica, Wind, Shortne&s;s of Breath, Hypochondriack Melancholy, and Falling-Sickne&s;s;</HI> which Di&s;tempers are generally derived from evil Matter con|tained in the Stomach, as is likewi&s;e <HI>Gid|dine&s;s in the Head and Apoplexies,</HI> with
<PB N="21" REF="20">which my&s;elf once &s;eemed to be threat|ned; for after eating a plentiful Dinner, I was &s;eized with Giddine&s;s, and the Sight of my Eyes became &s;o depraved, that things &s;eemed double, which was accom|panied with a &s;trange Con&s;ternation of Spirit; and having read, <HI>that Apoplexies generally &s;eize after eating,</HI> I immediate|ly called for Water, and not daring to &s;tay till it was warmed, I drank it cold, and by the help of my Finger provoked Vomiting: upon which I did immediate|ly overcome the Evils I was threatned with, the Symptoms before mentioned being the &s;ame as did precede the Fit of an Apoplexy in another Per&s;on, as him&s;elf afterwards told me, who died of it the third Fit.</P>
<P>As for People who are troubled with Shortne&s;s of Breath, 'tis certain from Ex|perience, that Vomiting with warm Wa|ter three or four times will afford certain Relief. And the &s;ame may be prevented by drinking nothing but Water after|wards, either cold, or warmed with a Toa&s;t: for upon doing this, the Difficulty of Breathing will apparently abate; which Water, if you plea&s;e, may be boiled with Honey. And I knew one, who by this means, <HI>as he was advi&s;ed by me,</HI> lived comfortably in this City two or three
<PB N="22" REF="21">Winters, but having undertaken Bu&s;ine&s;s which did occa&s;ion drinking &s;trong Drinks, was the next Winter carried off by the Di&s;temper: Wine, Ale, or Brandy, being as bad as Poi&s;on to People troubled with Shortne&s;s of Breath.</P>
<P>Some People are taken with <HI>violent Vo|miting,</HI> and the Exce&s;s thereof in &s;ome hath been &s;o great, as to endanger their Lives, yea, cau&s;e Death: in which Ca&s;e Water will be very helpful; for if a Pint of it warmed be drank after every Vo|mit, it will prevent that violent Straining, wherein lieth the Danger of all Vomiting, becau&s;e to &s;train violently when but little will come up, does endanger the break|ing of &s;ome inward Ve&s;&s;el. And be&s;ides this, the offending Matter will be &s;ooner loo&s;en'd from the internal Part of that Bowel, <HI>the Stomach,</HI> and ca&s;t out, upon which the Vomiting will &s;ooner cea&s;e: For after this manner the famous <HI>Syden|ham,</HI> a mo&s;t hone&s;t Writer, did overcome the <HI>Cholera Morbus,</HI> or Vomiting and Loo&s;ene&s;s, &s;o common in his Time, and was found by the weekly Bill to kill more than now die of Convul&s;ions; for his way was to boil a Chicken in four Gallons of Water, which made a Broth not much differing from Water, of which he order'd large Draughts to be given, and &s;ome of
<PB N="23" REF="22">it to be taken by Cly&s;ter, till the whole Quantity was &s;pent, <HI>if the Vomiting did not &s;top before;</HI> which did &s;o take off the Sharpne&s;s of the Matter offending, and wa&s;h it out, that the Party in a little time became well. And the &s;ame was the Practice of <HI>Sigi&s;mundus Gra&s;ius,</HI> who commends pure Water in a Vomit|ing and Loo&s;ene&s;s to be drank in large Quantities; for thereby, he &s;aith, the corro&s;ive or &s;harp Humours will be &s;o weaken'd, that they will no more offend: and he faith it may be drank cold, if the Patient be &s;trong, otherwi&s;e let it be warmed.</P>
<P>And in <HI>Common Fluxes</HI> without Vomit|ings a Quart or more of warm Water drank, will &s;o weaken the Sharpne&s;s whereby the Di&s;temper is cau&s;ed, that it will &s;oon be overcome, and the Gripings ea&s;ed; and in the <HI>Bloody Flux,</HI> which is the mo&s;t dangerous of all Fluxes, the in|genious <HI>Cornelius Cel&s;us</HI> advi&s;eth a large Drinking of cold Water as the be&s;t of Remedies: but then no other Sub&s;tance mu&s;t be taken till the Di&s;ea&s;e is cured. And another great Phy&s;ician, by Name <HI>Lu&s;itanus,</HI> affirms, <HI>Cent.</HI> 1. <HI>Ob&s;er.</HI> 46. that he knew one, who, being in the Summer-time afflicted with this bloody Flux, did drink a large quantity of cold
<PB N="24" REF="23">Water, and did thereby recover. This large quantity therefore of Water in the&s;e Fluxes, doth &s;o correct the Sharpne&s;s of the Humour offending, that it can have no power to cau&s;e Pain, or corrode the Ve&s;&s;els, and cau&s;e bloody Dige&s;tions or Stools.</P>
<P>Water al&s;o is a Drink that conduceth above all things to cure <HI>Con&s;umptive People,</HI> for the Dige&s;tion being weaken'd, is the Cau&s;e of producing a hot, fretting Nouri&s;hment; which is injurious to the tender Sub&s;tance of the Lungs, and which con&s;tringes and &s;tops up the Lymphatick Ve&s;&s;els, thro which the Nouri&s;hment is to pa&s;s to all the Parts; &s;o that by de|grees <HI>the Body for want of due Supplies con&s;umes:</HI> which Ob&s;tructions, and that Acrimony that cau&s;eth them, will be o|pen'd and &s;weeten'd by the plentiful U&s;e of Water; <HI>if taken before the Lungs be|come ulcerous.</HI> Which Cure of Con&s;ump|tions by Water is recommended in the Writings of Dr. <HI>Couch,</HI> who in his <HI>Praxis Catholica</HI> tells us, that he knew a Man cured very &s;oon of a Con&s;umption by drinking pure Water. And 'tis &s;aid by another, that &s;ome have been cured of Con&s;umptions by drinking no other Drink but Water, <HI>avoiding all Malt Li|quors and &s;harp Wines:</HI> for Wine or
<PB N="25" REF="24">any other &s;trong Liquor is pernicious in this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Some there are who are much troubled with <HI>flu&s;hing Heat</HI> in their Face, and o|thers <HI>with a Heat in the Back;</HI> in both which Ca&s;es, Water, u&s;ed as common Drink, is the be&s;t Remedy, with a &s;pare cooling Diet: and 'tis al&s;o excellent for &s;uch as have <HI>red Blotches in their Face,</HI> which proceeds from a hot fretting Blood, which, by Water-drinking, and a mode|rate Diet, will be kept under: for as Dr. <HI>Duncan,</HI> before quoted, doth affirm, tho&s;e who keep their Blood cool and clean, are never troubled with Breakings out, like many others, who may be known to be Drinkers of hot Drinks, and u&s;e a hot full Diet, by their Faces.</P>
<P>Water is al&s;o commended by the Lear|ned for the Cholick; thus <HI>Riverius</HI> af|firms, that in the Cholick large drinking of Water hath been found to be an excel|lent Remedy; and 'tis &s;aid by <HI>Fortis,</HI> that when he practi&s;ed at <HI>Venice,</HI> he often gave cold Water in the Cholick with good Succe&s;s. With whom an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phy&s;ician, Dr. <HI>Wainwright,</HI> in his <HI>Me|chanical Account of the &s;ix Non-natu|rals,</HI> concurs; for he &s;aith that Water-Drinkers are never troubled with the
<PB N="26" REF="25">Cholick, and that many thereby have been cured when all other Remedies failed.</P>
<P>And in the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> Water hath al&s;o been proved to be an excellent Drink. <HI>Salmon,</HI> in his <HI>Synop&s;is Medicinae,</HI> &s;aith, that in this Di&s;temper you may &s;afely give the Sick fair Water, of which, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> they may drink liberally to quench Thir&s;t; the want of which plenty of Drink hath been the Death of many a Patient. Which Opinion of his was right, as by Experience I have found in two of my own Children, when &s;ick of this Di&s;tem|per; to whom, after I had given a gentle Vomit of Emetick Tartar, I gave no other Drink but Water, and they both recove|red &s;afely, and were not in the lea&s;t light-headed, as two others before were in the &s;ame Di&s;temper, when treated otherwi&s;e: and I remember that one Dr. <HI>Betts</HI> being con&s;ulted in a Ca&s;e where the Eruptions did not come out kindly, did order two Quarts of cold Water to be drank as &s;oon as could be, upon which they came out according to expectation, and the Party did well.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o certain, that in what we call burning Fevers, Water is found to be a &s;afe and effectual Remedy. It is &s;aid by
<PB N="27" REF="26">Dr. <HI>Primro&s;e,</HI> in his <HI>Popular Errors,</HI> that many great Phy&s;icians <HI>have commended the drinking cold Water in Di&s;ea&s;es, and they attribute to it the chief Place in Fevers,</HI> where the Sick mu&s;t drink large|ly; for thus taken, <HI>it will quench all Heat,</HI> pag. 374. And <HI>Galen</HI> is &s;aid, by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Author, to reprove <HI>Cra&s;i&s;tratus</HI> for denying cold Water in burning Fe|vers; and &s;ays, that this is a Remedy for any Fever, <HI>provided it be drank in great abundance:</HI> with which Opinion I find Dr. <HI>Oliver</HI> to agree, who, in his <HI>E&s;|&s;ay on Fevers,</HI> &s;ays, That in Fevers we mu&s;t drink oftner than Thir&s;t calls for it, and &s;uch Draughts as are plentiful; and the Drink he pre&s;cribes, is either cold Water or Barley-Water. Dr. <HI>Wainwright</HI> af|firms al&s;o, that Water is proper in Fe|vers, <HI>and that the Antients gave as much of it as the Patient could drink.</HI> And by another 'tis &s;aid, that if you give the Patient nothing but Water for three Days, that in the third Day the Fever will be cured generally; but if it is not, give for Food a little Barley-Broth, and the Fever will not exceed the &s;eventh Day. And by another we are informed, how one in a Fever, <HI>that was pa&s;t Hope,</HI> being forbidden to drink Water, which he greatly de&s;ired, did find means, in the Ab&s;ence of his Nur&s;e, to get a large
<PB N="28" REF="27">Pot-full, which he drank off, and lay down again, being well cooled; after which he fell into a Sweat, and &s;o was cured. And I find that Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> of <HI>Warwick,</HI> in his <HI>Book of Ob&s;ervations on</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Bodies,</HI> does pre&s;cribe, for the Cure of Fevers, fir&s;t a Vomit, and afterwards as much cold Water as the Patient can drink; and he &s;aith, that if he &s;weat upon it, the Sweat mu&s;t he continued as long as can be. And 'tis &s;aid by another, that 'tis an excellent Remedy in Fevers to drink a Quart of hot Water, and &s;weat upon it, being covered warm. There is al&s;o one Dr. <HI>Quinton,</HI> who, in his <HI>Book of Ob&s;er|vations,</HI> writes, That to one in a malig|nant Fever, who&s;e Pul&s;e was &s;o low it could &s;carcely be felt, there was three Quarts of Water given, at &s;everal Draughts, to make him vomit; but it did not ope|rate that way, yet the Event was this, that it did refre&s;h him, much rai&s;ed his Pul&s;e, brought him into a breathing Sweat, and pa&s;&s;ed off by Urine: which Lowne&s;s of the Pul&s;e my own Experience hath often found to be rai&s;ed by drinking Water plentifully. And I know a Woman, who tho' &s;he in a Fever had the Advice of two Doctors, yet became di&s;tracted: I bid the Nur&s;e give her a Pint of cold Water, which &s;he drank up, and in three or four Minutes came to her right Sen&s;es;
<PB N="29" REF="28">and de&s;iring to drink more, &s;he recovered. And I have ob&s;erved, that when, in Fe|vers, the Patient can reli&s;h no other Drink, yet Water is always drank with plea&s;ure, as it al&s;o will always be after the eating &s;weet things, that &s;poil the Reli&s;h of o|ther Drinks; which is one Excellence pe|culiar to Water, and &s;hews it to be mo&s;t agreeable to the Nature of Mankind, tho' now &s;o much &s;lighted.</P>
<P>And as for the <HI>Gout,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Harris</HI> &s;aith, in his <HI>Anti-Empirice,</HI> is gotten ei|ther by high feeding, or drinking much Wine, or other &s;trong Drink; it may be cured, as that Author doth affirm, by a very &s;pare Diet, and drinking Water: ac|cording to what is &s;aid al&s;o by Sir <HI>Theo|dore Mayhern,</HI> who, in his <HI>Medicinal Coun&s;els,</HI> advi&s;eth to leave off all &s;trong Drinks in this Di&s;ea&s;e, and drink only Water. And <HI>Van Heydon</HI> &s;aith al&s;o, in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Help for the Rich and Poor,</HI> that there is not any greater Reme|dy for the Gout <HI>than drinking Water,</HI> not only by young but old Men; many of whom, he &s;aith, have drank cold Water for many Weeks, <HI>which hath &s;ucceeded &s;o well, though they were far gone in Years,</HI> that they found great Ea&s;e there|by, without that Offence to the Stomach, or Hindrance of Dige&s;tion, which &s;ome
<PB N="30" REF="29">did &s;eem to fear. And he al&s;o commends the large drinking of Water in the Scia|tica, or Hip-Gout, he having often cured this Di&s;temper, by this means, in le&s;s time than could rea&s;onably be expected; and the &s;ame my&s;elf have found to be effec|tual in a like Pain in the Shoulder, which had continued very bad for three Months. For, being taken with a Fever, I drank in one Day about four Quarts of Water; which though it did not make me &s;weat, becau&s;e I lay not in my Bed, yet it cured me &s;o that I &s;lept well that Night; and in the Morning, when I ro&s;e, I did find that the Pain in my Shoulder was not felt, neither did it ever return. And the &s;ame Succe&s;s I have had in the Pains of other Parts, whereby I judge, that in all Pains whatever the drinking of Water is proper, as well as in the Gout; and ac|cordingly I find cold Water advi&s;ed to be drank largely for the Cure of the Head|ach from hard Drinking; that Pain pro|ceeding from the &s;ame Cau&s;e the Gout does, namely from Heat, as all Pains do.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o by Dr. <HI>Wainwright,</HI> that in the <HI>Itch, Scurvy, Lepro&s;y,</HI> and in all hot <HI>inflammatory Di&s;tempers,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Pleuri&s;ies, Rheumati&s;ms,</HI> and <HI>St. Antho|ny's. Fire,</HI> Water is a proper Remedy; but he advi&s;eth to drink it hot in &s;ome Ca|&s;es,
<PB N="31" REF="30">as doubtle&s;s ought to be done in <HI>Pleuri|&s;ies.</HI> He al&s;o &s;aith, that Water is proper in <HI>Head-aches, Catarrhs, Vapours, Falling-Sickne&s;s, Dullne&s;s of Sight, Melancholy, Shortne&s;s of Breath, Scurvey in the Mouth,</HI> and <HI>Windine&s;s in the Stomach:</HI> And, for Wind in the Stomach, I, by long Experience, have found it the be&s;t Reme|dy, who, in the former part of my Life, through a di&s;orderly Diet, and drinking &s;trong Drink <HI>like others,</HI> was never free from windy Belchings, and &s;ometimes ve|ry &s;icki&s;h Qualms after Meals; from which at length I was delivered, by drinking only Water at Meals, &s;o that for above forty Years I have been &s;eldom troubled: and if I find my&s;elf troubled, a Pint or more of cold Water, in le&s;s than half an Hour, will &s;et me free, by drinking of it.</P>
<P>And that Water is the be&s;t Remedy for the Mi&s;chiefs that come by <HI>Hard Drink|ing,</HI> Experience teacheth; there being no|thing that &s;o effectually frees from tho&s;e nau&s;eating and reaching Qualms the next Morning, as the drinking a Pint or more of fair Water; which effectually allays the Inflammation of the Bowels, occa&s;ioned by &s;trong or hot Drink, which &s;poils the Strength of the Stomach, as it doth the Strength of all other Parts; nothing being a greater Enemy to the Vigour of the
<PB N="32" REF="31">Nerves and Sinews, <HI>&s;ince by much drink|ing, Men make them&s;elves unable to &s;tand or go:</HI> Which Effect would never follow, if Liquors, that abound with Spi|rits, were &s;trengthening; and if they were &s;trengthening, the Fibres of the Stomach would not be &s;o weakened, after drinking &s;trong Drinks, as to make Men &s;ick: which Sickne&s;s will &s;oon be recovered by the drinking cold Water, this being al&s;o the be&s;t Remedy, if taken largely, for that Heat of Urine which is often occa&s;ioned by Hard-drinking.</P>
<P>In <HI>Colds,</HI> Water is the be&s;t of all Drinks to prevent Floods of Rheum from the No&s;e and Mouth, as my long Experience te&s;tifies, and the drinking thereof will <HI>prevent Coughs;</HI> for a Cough will &s;eldom &s;ucceed a Cold, if Water is u&s;ed from the fir&s;t as common Drink: and if, through Neglect, a Cough &s;hould become trou|ble&s;ome, the U&s;e of Water, <HI>avoiding all Wine and &s;trong Drink,</HI> will contribute much to the Cure. Some order the Wa|ter to be drank warm, but others &s;ay that to drink it cold va&s;tly excells the u&s;ing of it hot in a Cough. 'Tis &s;aid by <HI>Van Hey|don,</HI> that &s;ome may think it &s;trange to ad|vi&s;e Water in &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es, which mo&s;t do account to proceed from Crudity or Indige&s;tion; but, he &s;ays, that in any Di&s;|ea&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="32">where the Ca&s;e is dangerous, <HI>the U&s;e of Water is the only Friend to Na|ture;</HI> cold Water being a Preventer ra|ther than a Cau&s;e of Crudity, &s;ince, by all Experience, it is proved to be a Pro|moter of a good Dige&s;tion: And at this time I know a Woman, 78 Years of Age, who for this ten Years hath had a great Cough, and &s;pits much tough Phlegm, that hath this pre&s;ent Winter 1722, been per&s;uaded to leave off all &s;trong and &s;mall fermented Liquor, and drink only Wa|ter at Meals, and &s;ometimes a Di&s;h or two of Tea; and hath found her&s;elf much le&s;s &s;ubject to cough than before, and &s;carce coughs at all in Bed.</P>
<P>It is the general Opinion of mo&s;t Phy&s;i|cians, that Wine and Strong-Drinks are not proper for Children, and that the &s;maller and cooler their Drink is, the bet|ter it will be with them; and that no|thing conduceth more to the Health of Children than drinking Water, which will prevent the Foundation of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es that are cau&s;ed in many by Strong-Drink, and do &s;hew them&s;elves in their more advanced Age, wherein ma|ny al&s;o do &s;uffer much by the ill Cu&s;tom of making them Gluttons, by con&s;tantly cramming their Stomachs with Food, many being thereby de&s;troyed among the
<PB N="34" REF="33">Children of the Rich before they come to the Years of Maturity; when the Chil|dren of poor Country People, who fare hard, and very often drink Water, &s;tand their Ground till full grown: for fewer Children die in the Country than in great Cities, where Luxury in Diet doth more abound; which is one Rea&s;on <HI>why &s;o few Hou&s;ekeepers in</HI> London <HI>were born in it,</HI> the great Supply of Inhabitants being from the Country, Children being brought up more hardy there than in <HI>London,</HI> where great Numbers are killed by over-plea&s;ing their Palates. Which Mi&s;chief would be, in a great mea&s;ure, prevented by their being accu&s;tomed to drink Wa|ter; which, by Experience, is found to make young Children free from that Frow|ardne&s;s which is commonly cau&s;ed by a &s;harp, and hot, or feveri&s;h Blood, which ingendereth Wind, and cau&s;eth Pain and Gripes: for there is no Pain but is the Con&s;equence of Heat, if it is not cau&s;ed by Blows and Brui&s;es.</P>
<P>Water, I have found, by long Experi|ence, to be of excellent u&s;e <HI>in Burns and Scalds;</HI> for in all Burns and Scalds that are &s;light, if the Part is plunged imme|diately into cold Water, <HI>the colder the better,</HI> the Pain will in&s;tantly be ta|ken off; and it will fetch out the Fire, if
<PB N="35" REF="34">continued &s;o long, as will be required to do it by any other Remedy. And if the Burn be &s;o con&s;iderable, that other Reme|dies mu&s;t be applied, none of which will take off the Smart of them&s;elves <HI>in le&s;s than two or three Hours;</HI> yet if you ap|ply cold Water pre&s;ently, after other Ap|plications are made to the Part, the Pain immediately will cea&s;e, till the Re|medy becomes effectual: &s;o that the Ea&s;e Water will give in &s;uch Ca&s;es, makes it of good U&s;e. Which Remedy, <HI>as it hath not been di&s;covered till now,</HI> appears to tran&s;cend all other Remedies in this Ca&s;e; becau&s;e, in a moment, the great Smart will be ea&s;ed, if the Water is cold, and will be felt no more if the Part afflicted be kept immer&s;ed in it till the Fire is extin|gui&s;hed, either by the Water, or the Me|dicine applied. <HI>Be&s;ides, it is a Remedy every where ready at hand,</HI> which can|not be &s;aid of any other; which generally requires &s;o much time to get it ready, that much Pain will be endured, if Bli|&s;ters do not ari&s;e, which do much increa&s;e the Trouble. <HI>If the Part burnt, or &s;calded, cannot be dipt in Water,</HI> you may apply Water to it, with double Lin|nen Cloths dipped therein, and new dipt as they grow warm; by which means I have cured Burns and Scalds in the Face
<PB N="36" REF="35">without bli&s;tering, when applied imme|diately before Bli&s;ters did ari&s;e.</P>
<P>I once knew a large Ulcer in the Foot, made by the running of melted Bra&s;s in|to the Shoe, that was kept in hand by a Surgeon nine Weeks, without any pro|bability of healing, <HI>becau&s;e of the great Inflammation that attended it;</HI> but the Party being a Lover of Angling, was per&s;uaded to go with &s;ome others to <HI>Hackney River:</HI> &s;ome of them went bare|legg'd into the Water, to come at a cer|tain Hole where much Fi&s;h was &s;ome|times found. The Sport was &s;o good that the lame Man, having pulled off his Stock|ings and Plai&s;ters, went in al&s;o, where he &s;taid above two Hours, and coming out again he found the Ulcer, which appear|ed very red and angry when he went in, did look pale; <HI>he put on his Dre&s;&s;ings,</HI> and came home, and in le&s;e than a Fort|night his Ulcer healed up: which doubt|le&s;s was occa&s;ioned by the abating of the Inflammation by the Coldne&s;s of the Water. And I have had an Account al&s;o from an Acquaintance, that was Surgeon to a Merchant Ship, that their Gunner, at a time when the Captain treated &s;ome Friends on board, going to charge a Gun that ju&s;t before had been fired off, the Car|tridge he was ramming down took fire,
<PB N="37" REF="36">whereby he was blown into the Water, and had &s;ome of his Fingers torn off, and it was about an Hour before a Boat could be got to take him up: but they found that the Coldne&s;s of the Water had al|mo&s;t &s;topt the Bleeding, and the Cure was effected &s;o &s;peedily, that other Surgeons wondered at it; which he imputed to the Water, which kept back the Humours, by its Coldne&s;s, from flowing to the Part at the fir&s;t: &s;o that there was no Impedi|ment, from Inflammation, to hinder heal|ing; for the chief Impediment to healing, is Inflammation in Wounds or Ulcers.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Strains and Sprains</HI> in the Joints, cold Water affords the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;peedy Remedy, as <HI>Van Heydon</HI> af|firms; who &s;aith, That by bathing in cold Water all harm &s;o received may, by this Remedy, be cured more &s;afely and more &s;peedily than by any other, with|out Lo&s;s of Time, Co&s;t, or Trouble; for no more is to be done, than, as &s;oon as can be, <HI>to put the Part into a Tub of cold Water for about two Hours,</HI> which will prevent all Swelling and Pain, by repelling or keeping back the Humours that otherwi&s;e would flow to the Part. And if it &s;hould be the Shoulder, or any other Part, which is &s;o hurt, that cannot well be immer&s;ed in Water after this
<PB N="38" REF="37">manner, Water may be applied, by dip|ping Towels folded up into it, and lay|ing them to the Part, as is done, in effect, to the wrenched Joints of Hor&s;es; about which, if you wind oftentimes a thick Rope made of Hairs, and then ca&s;t upon it divers times a Pail of cold Water, the Wrench will be cured; which Experi|ment is now commonly practi&s;ed by tho&s;e concerned about Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Bathing in cold Water hath al&s;o been found to be a good Remedy <HI>to &s;trengthen Weakne&s;s in the Joints,</HI> as Sir <HI>John Floyer,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Cold Bathing,</HI> hath &s;hewed; and which by Experience I found to be true in a certain Woman, who complained of great Weakne&s;s and Pain in her Ankles: I advi&s;ed her to dip the Part in cold Water every Morning for about a quarter of an Hour, and to do the &s;ame at Night; and in about twenty Days &s;he became as &s;trong in that Part as &s;he was in the other. And Sir <HI>John</HI> tells us of a Boy who could not &s;tand, his Limbs were &s;o weak, that by bathing in cold Water, perfectly recover'd his Strength in a little time.</P>
<P>Great <HI>Pain in the Head</HI> hath been al&s;o cured by this means; for we are told by <HI>Van Heydon,</HI> that one Sir <HI>Toby Mathews</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="38">had for twenty Years been troubled with great Pain in one &s;ide of his Head, and a great Defluxion of Rheum from his No&s;e; but he at la&s;t was cured, by apply|ing cold Water to the Part every day for about a quarter of an hour: upon read|ing of which, I tried the Experiment up|on my&s;elf, who for a long time had been trouble with the running of much clear Water from my No&s;e, with great &s;pitting of thin Rheum: for I let a Water-Cock run upon the Mould of my Head every Morning, by which, in about &s;ix Weeks time, I was ea&s;ed of my Trouble. And &s;ince that I had a credible Information of a certain Servant-Maid, who was af|flicted greatly with a Rheumati&s;m and an intolerable Pain in the Head, who be|ing put into <HI>St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital,</HI> her Nur&s;e was order'd by the Doctor to ap|ply to her Head Towels four times dou|ble, dipt in cold Water, changing them as they became warm, which &s;he was to continue doing four or five Hours; in which time &s;he was freed from that Pain in the Head, and was afterwards cured of the <HI>Rheumati&s;m</HI> by other Means.</P>
<P>The <HI>Want of Sleep in Fevers</HI> may be cured likewi&s;e by the Application of cold Water: for to a near Relation, who could not &s;leep for three Days and three Nights,
<PB N="40" REF="39">I order'd a Towel to be &s;everal times folded up, then to be dipt in Water, and a little wrung out an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o laid upon her Forehead, and to be new dipt as it grew hot; which in about two Hours time &s;o cool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d her Head, that &s;he fell into a Sleep, and conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters"> in it five Hours: and I or|der'd the farce to be done the next Night, with the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">me effect. And we find that Dr. <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">kbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Sea Di&s;|ea&s;es,</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d order for the want of Sleep in Fevers, to dip a Towel, four times dou|bled, in <HI>Oxycrat,</HI> which is &s;ix parts Wa|ter, and one part Vinegar, to be bound about the Head and Temples; which, he &s;aith, will cau&s;e Sleep with wonderful Succe&s;s: but Water only will have the &s;ame effect, as I often have proved.</P>
<P>And that the U&s;e of cold Water <HI>in Swoonings</HI> is of great effect, common Ex|perience teacheth; for if a Di&s;h or Cup of cold Water is thrown &s;trongly upon the Face, the Per&s;on in an in&s;tant will recover his Sen&s;es, tho for a time he &s;eemeth dead, and perhaps might not have reco|ver'd in &s;ome ca&s;es, if cold Water had not been &s;o applied: &s;uch Faintings being &s;ometimes deadly, which proceed from po&s;|&s;onous Vapours a&s;cending up to the Brain from a foul Stomach; for &s;uch Effects there are, as I have found by Experience,
<PB N="41" REF="40">who, in my young Days, did &s;woon away twice; at both which times I was &s;en&s;i|ble of a Collection of Wind in my Sto|mach, from whence I plainly felt a Fume or Vapour a&s;cend to the Head, that in an in&s;tant deprived me of all Sen&s;e: but be|ing both times in the Company of a Per|&s;on who had &s;een the thing tried, he da&s;h'd &s;ome cold Water again&s;t my Face, which I remember made me &s;tart, as if I had been &s;uddenly a waked. And I am apt to think, that &s;ome die in &s;uch a Fit, when none are near to help them; and e&s;pecially when &s;o taken in their Sleep, which, I believe, none need fear who live temperately, or that eat no Suppers: none who have refrained from Suppers, having been ever found to die in Sleep.</P>
<P>Dangerous <HI>Bleedings at the No&s;e</HI> have al&s;o been cured with cold Water largely drank, &s;yringing cold Water up their No&s;trils, and applying Towels round their Necks dipt in cold Water, changing them as they grow warm; for 'tis &s;aid by a good Writer, that this will &s;o cool the Heat of the Blood, and by the Coldne&s;s of the Water &s;yringed up the No&s;e, &s;o contract the Mouths of the bur&s;ted Veins which bleed, that it will put a &s;top to the Bleeding. Such Bleedings have al&s;o been &s;topt by da&s;hing cold Water often
<PB N="42" REF="41">into the Face, as a <HI>French</HI> Writer hath affirmed, who&s;e Name was <HI>Flamand;</HI> and the &s;ame al&s;o is affirmed by <HI>Cook,</HI> in his <HI>Marrow of Surgery.</HI></P>
<P>Cold Water is an ab&s;olute Cure for all <HI>&s;mall Cuts in the Fingers or other Parts;</HI> for if when cut, you clo&s;e the Cut up with the Thumb of your other Hand, keeping it &s;o clo&s;ed for a quarter or half an Hour, this will infallibly &s;top the Bleeding: after which, if you double up a Linnen Rag five or &s;ix times, dip it in cold Water, and apply it to the Part, binding it on fa&s;t. This, by preventing Inflammation and a Flux of Humours, will give Nature time &s;oon to heal it without any other Application, as is &s;een in the common Practice of Surgeons when they let a Man blood; for all the Appli|cation they make to the Vein &s;o cut, is a Pledget of Linnen dipt in cold Water, and bound on with a Fillet: for all Wounds without lo&s;s of Sub&s;tance will heal of them&s;elves, if Inflammation is prevented, and the Lips of the Wound are kept clo&s;e together.</P>
<P>We al&s;o are told by <HI>Van Heydon,</HI> that in his time &s;ome were of an opinion, that a Per&s;on bit by a mad Dog might be pre|&s;erved from that Symptom, call'd, <HI>The
<PB N="43" REF="42">Fear of Water,</HI> which generally follows and proves &s;o mortal, by applying cold Water to the Place bitten: And this, he &s;ays, they conceive to be no unlikely thing, if there is any credit to be given to what <HI>Cornelius Cel&s;us</HI> writes, who &s;aith, that the only Remedy in this ca&s;e is to throw the Party who is in this Condition, or hath <HI>the Fear of Water</HI> upon him, into a Pond or River, and when plunged over Head and Ears, to keep him in the Wa|ter till filled with it, whether he will or no; and by this means both his Thir&s;t and Dread of Water will be cured. For if this Immer&s;ion be of u&s;e when the Party is &s;o far gone, why &s;hould it not be of greater force in pre&s;erving from it, if &s;pee|dily applied and repeated? Now tho this is mention'd by him as a probable Opi|nion, yet Experience in our days &s;hews, <HI>That the plunging the Patient into the &s;alt Water either of the River of</HI> Thames, <HI>about</HI> Grave&s;end, <HI>or in the &s;alt Springs in</HI> Che&s;hire, is an infallible means to pre|vent any Evil &s;ucceeding the Bite of a mad Dog; they mu&s;t indeed be dipt &s;o often, as to be almo&s;t drown'd before the Danger is over; but 'tis a que&s;tion whe|ther the Saltne&s;s of the Water contributes any thing to this Cure, &s;ince <HI>Boer have,</HI> the pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden,</HI> affirms, That when Men bitten by a mad Dog are
<PB N="44" REF="43">arrived to the Fear of Water, call'd an <HI>Hydrophobia,</HI> they may be cured, by blind|ing the Patient's Eyes, and throwing of him into a Pond of Water often, till he &s;eems not to be afraid of it, or but very little, and then force him to drink large Quantities.</P>
<P>And we are told by Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> that a Per&s;on troubled with the <HI>Falling Sick|ne&s;s,</HI> by happening to fall into a cold Spring, <HI>(I &s;uppo&s;e it was in the time of his Fit)</HI> was freed from his Di&s;temper all his Life after: and he &s;aith there is no need of preparing the Body for it in this, as in &s;ome other Ca&s;es. But the Patient, when plunged into a cold Bath, ought to continue in the Bath each time about three or four Minutes: for in plunging over head and ears at his fir&s;t Entrance into a cold Bath, the Brain will be &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly affected, as to be relieved from the Di&s;temper, which is a kind of Convul|&s;ion proceeding from an Inflammation, or &s;ome other Cau&s;e; <HI>but we want more Experiments to confirm this Notion:</HI> Which Notion may be worth noting, that the thing may be tried in others, to &s;ee whether it will &s;ucceed as it did in this Per&s;on. For 'tis &s;aid by the ingenious Dr. <HI>Pitcairn,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> &s;ome time <HI>Profe&s;&s;or</HI> at <HI>Leyden,</HI> that there is no &s;uch
<PB N="45" REF="44">thing as the Art of Phy&s;ick, but Reme|dies were found out by chance, <HI>p.</HI> 264. of his Works; for if Phy&s;ick were an Art as certain in its Rules, as the Rules are that belong to Mu&s;ick, or to Watch-making, Phy&s;icians would as &s;eldom be mi&s;taken in their Pre&s;criptions, as the others are in their De&s;igns. But when Remedies happen to be di&s;cover'd, and prove often to be ef|fectual, the remembring that Remedy, to apply it in a like ca&s;e, often brings Reputation to the Pre&s;criber; and if it fails, &s;ome other Experiment mu&s;t be tried, which, were Phy&s;ick an Art, need not be done.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o &s;aid by the &s;ame Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> that Madne&s;s and Melancholy, with all their Retinue, may find better Effects from the U&s;e of bathing in cold Water, than from other violent Methods, with which People &s;o afflicted are now treated; for, &s;ays he, <HI>that which will make a drunken Man &s;ober in a minute, will certainly go a great way towards the Cure of a Madman in a month.</HI> Now 'tis mo&s;t certain, to my own Knowledge, that if a drunken Man be plunged over head and ears in cold Water, he will come out of it perfectly &s;ober: And &s;ome I have known, that in &s;uch ca&s;es have been recover'd by barely wa&s;hing their Heads
<PB N="46" REF="45">in cold Water. And the forementioned Opinion of Dr. <HI>Browne</HI> is confirmed by the Practice of Dr. <HI>Blair,</HI> who, in a Let|ter to Dr. <HI>Baynard,</HI> declares, That he cu|red a Man raving mad, who being bound in a Cart, &s;tript of his Clothes, and blind|folded, that the Surprize might be the greater; he on a &s;udden had a great Fall of Water let down upon him from the height of twenty foot, <HI>under which he continued &s;o long as his Strength would permit:</HI> and after his Return home, he fell into a Sleep, and &s;lept twenty-nine Hours, and awaked in as quiet a State of Mind as ever, and &s;o had continued to the time of the writing that Letter, which was twelve Months.</P>
<P>Which Relation &s;eems to make that a more probable Truth, which was related in a Letter from Sir <HI>John Floyer</HI> to Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> and printed by that Doctor; wherein it is &s;aid, that in <HI>Normandy</HI> they immer&s;e Fools, or dip them in cold Wa|ter, to cure them: a hot Brain being the Cau&s;e, perhaps, of &s;everal Di&s;orders in the Under&s;tanding, and is in great part found to be true, in the ridiculous Behaviour of &s;ome drunken Men, which, when their Heads are become cool, abhor what they before did do or &s;ay. Now if &s;uch Dipping would cure Fools among us, great Num|bers
<PB N="47" REF="46">might be made more happy than they are.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Browne,</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>of Cold Baths,</HI> affirms likewi&s;e, that to bathe in cold Water hath been found to be the quicke&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, and plea&s;ante&s;t Cure for the King's Evil; and he tells us, in <HI>p.</HI> 85. of a <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Gentleman, who was grievou&s;ly afflicted with this Di&s;temper, having great Ulcers in the Glands of his Neck, which were &s;o much inflamed, as to bring him very low; but being advi&s;ed by Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> to bathe in the Cold Bath, he in a Month's time was perfectly cured, his Ulcers being healed up, con|trary to the Opinion of the mo&s;t learned Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>We al&s;o find mention, in the De&s;cription of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands, of an odd Remedy commonly made u&s;e of there for the Cure of the <HI>Jaundice;</HI> which is this: They &s;trip the Party naked, lay him upon the Ground on his Belly, and pour unawares upon his Back a Pail of cold Water. And al&s;o Pains in the Joints, as Dr. <HI>Curtis</HI> tells us, will be cured, by holding the Part under the Stream of a Pump or Cock; and fomenting with cold Water is commended as good to a&s;&s;uage hot Swel|lings. And I know a Per&s;on who had
<PB N="48" REF="47">often been &s;ubject to blood-&s;hot or in|flamed Eyes, who afterwards, upon the beginning of the &s;ame Di&s;temper, took, by Advice, a Ball of linnen Rags, dipt them in cold Water, and applied them to the Part, cooling them by new dipping as oft as they grew hot: which Applica|tion was continued three Hours, in which time the Humour was &s;o repelled, as to be trouble&s;ome no more; for the Party, to my knowledge, hath had no &s;ign of that Di&s;temper &s;ince, tho the &s;ame had been very trouble&s;ome many times be|fore.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o advi&s;ed by Dr. <HI>Gideon Har|vey,</HI> to wa&s;h the Eyes well twice a day in cold Water, as the be&s;t Remedy to prevent Defluxions on them, and pre&s;erve the Eye-&s;ight, which it greatly comforts. And this I have found true for many Years, my Eyes being often apt to be dim and &s;tiff on a &s;udden, &s;o that I could &s;carce open my Eye-lids; which, upon wa&s;hing for a minute with fair Water, hath been felt no more till a good while after. Be|&s;ides which Benefit to the Eyes, Authors &s;ay it is al&s;o good to pre&s;erve the Memo|ry, if the whole Forehead be wa&s;hed twice a day; which is a certain Cure for itching in the Eyes, as Authors tell us.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="48">
<P>Some People are troubled with a <HI>Callo|&s;ity,</HI> or <HI>Hardne&s;s of the Bottoms of their Feet,</HI> which is &s;o trouble&s;ome, as to be a hindrance to their ea&s;y walking; for which a Cure is pre&s;cribed by Dr. <HI>Cook,</HI> that is, to &s;oak them well in warm Wa|ter, till the Hardne&s;s is &s;often'd, and then &s;crape it off with the Edge of a Knife: and if the Feet burn with any unnatural Heat, the bathing often in hot Water will cool them, by giving vent to what offends.</P>
<P>And the plentiful drinking of Water is commended in the Scurvey, by Dr. <HI>Pit|cairn,</HI> to di&s;&s;olve the Scorbutick Salts, and carry them out by Urine, whether they are Acids or Alkalies; and my&s;elf having formerly been extremely troubled with the Scurvey, which often made me faint and weak, and my Pul&s;e &s;o low as &s;carce|ly to be felt, I found at la&s;t that the Pul&s;e would infallibly ri&s;e upon drinking a Pint or more of cold Water, and in a little time I &s;hould become brisk and &s;trong: For I have often found that upon a Di&s;order of the Stomach, the Strength of the bodily Members &s;oon would fail, and would ea&s;ily be recovered when the Di&s;|order of the Stomach was removed; and have, by long Experience, found that
<PB N="50" REF="49">nothing conduceth &s;o much to bodily Strength as a Stomach in right Order, which requires Temperance and cooling Drink.</P>
<P>To what hath been already &s;aid, I will add an Account, taken from a credible Per&s;on, of a Man in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Shore|ditch,</HI> who was de&s;perately ill of an A&s;th|ma, or Shortne&s;s of Breath, and deep Con&s;umption, for which he had tried ma|ny Remedies to no purpo&s;e. At length he was advi&s;ed by a Phy&s;ician, being poor, to drink no other Drink but Wa|ter, and eat no other Food but Water-gruel, without Salt or Sugar; which Cour&s;e of Diet he continued for three Months, finding him&s;elf at fir&s;t to be &s;omewhat better, and at the three Months end he was perfectly cured; but, for Se|curity-&s;ake, he continued in that Diet a Month longer, and grew &s;trong and fat upon it. But his Diet he had no mind to, till he was thorowly hungry, and then he eat with plea&s;ure; in which perhaps con&s;i&s;ted the be&s;t part of his Cure, it be|ing an Advantage to Health never to eat till Hunger calls for Food.</P>
<P>And I remember a young Woman, who was a Burni&s;her of Silver, who had a de&s;perate Cough, for which &s;he had
<PB N="51" REF="50">taken many things of an Apothecary to no purpo&s;e; at length the Journey man told her, his Ma&s;ter &s;aid, he could do more: but, &s;aid the Fellow, I would advi&s;e you every Morning to wa&s;h about and behind your Ears, and upon your Temples, and on the Mould of your Head with cold Water; which &s;he told me &s;he did, and in about a Week's time was perfectly cured of her Cough.</P>
<P>There are divers other Ca&s;es where in the U&s;e of Water hath done much good. I knew an antient Practi&s;er in Phy&s;ick, who told me, That in many Difficulties of making water, he had advi&s;ed the Par|ty to put his Yard into Water as hot as he could endure it, which, in a Minute, did cau&s;e him to make water; and that Women have had the &s;ame Benefit by &s;itting over hot Water. And he often had advi&s;ed them who were co&s;tive, and went to Stool with great difficulty, to &s;et over a Pot with hot Water in it; which &s;oon was attended with an ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, the Body drawing up the Vapour, which did provoke Expul&s;ion without much &s;train|ing.</P>
<P>And it hath been ob&s;erved, that froward Children have been made much more quiet, by wa&s;hing their lower Parts eve|ry
<PB N="52" REF="51">Morning with Water, to wa&s;h off the fretting Salts of their Urine, which u&s;u|ally &s;tick in the Pores of the Skin, and are fretful and unea&s;y, and nothing cures their Sorene&s;s about tho&s;e Parts like it. Nor is there are any thing more effectual to cure Men, who are gauled with Ri|ding, than to wa&s;h them&s;elves well, when they go to bed, with cold Water; and wa&s;hing the bare Brea&s;t and Neck every Morning with cold Water, will make tho&s;e hardy who before were apt at every turn to take Cold.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Water, when rightly made u&s;e of, doth appear, from the Accounts be|fore-mentioned, very effectual to pre|vent and cure many Di&s;ea&s;es, but more e&s;pecially the inward U&s;e thereof: for to u&s;e the words of the ingenious Dr. <HI>Cur|tis,</HI> in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay for the Pre&s;ervation and Recovery of Health;</HI> The habitual U&s;e of Water for common Drink <HI>pre|&s;erves the native Ferment of the Sto|mach in due Order, keeps the Blood tem|perate, and helps to &s;pin out the Thread of Life to the longe&s;t Extent of Nature; it makes the Re&s;t at Night more quiet and refre&s;hing, the Rea&s;on and Under|&s;tanding more clear, the Pa&s;&s;ions le&s;s di&s;|orderly; and, in ca&s;e of eating too much, a large Draught of cold Water va&s;tly
<PB N="53" REF="52">exceeds any other Cordial to cau&s;e Dige|&s;tion;</HI> Water being not &s;o cold and lifele&s;s, he &s;aith, as many do imagine. Be&s;ides which Commendation of it by this Doc|tor, <HI>'tis certainly a Drink that will not ferment in the Stomach, nor turn &s;our,</HI> as Wine and &s;trong Malt Drinks will do, to the hindering of a good Dige&s;tion, <HI>which all Acidity in the Stomach cer|tainly doth, when it abounds there;</HI> and is be&s;t corrected by weakening or making it le&s;s &s;our, by drinking good Store of Water, as the Experience of above forty Years Practice hath a&s;&s;ured my&s;elf and many others. For tho Water is counted a contemptible Drink, yet by beginning to make u&s;e of it at about thirty years of Age, <HI>before which I was often out of Or|der,</HI> and continuing the U&s;e of it ever &s;ince, drinking very little Wine or &s;trong Drink, I have attained to the Age of &s;e|venty-four Years; when Thou&s;ands, in the mean time, who delight only in drinking &s;trong Beer, Wine, and Brandy, have not lived half &s;o long: which maketh good that Saying in the Scriptures, That <HI>Wine is a Mocker, and &s;trong Drink is Ra|ging, and he who is deceived thereby is not wi&s;e;</HI> Prov. 20.1. &s;ince it no ways contributes to long Life; for 'tis certain that Thou&s;ands in the World live as long who drink no &s;trong Drink, <HI>as any Drin|kers
<PB N="54" REF="53">of it do.</HI> Some indeed, from an ex|traordinary Strength of Nature, have been hard Drinkers, and yet die old; but for one who does this, perhaps an hun|dred are de&s;troyed by it before they come to half the time of Life: and generally we &s;hall find that very &s;trong and heal|thy Con&s;titutions, at the long Run, are ruined by Riot and Exce&s;s, there being no certain Safety in any way of Living <HI>but that of Temperance and Moderation.</HI> Nature in &s;ome may, a long time, with|&s;tand the Abu&s;es offered to it, but at la&s;t it will yield to its Enemies; and tho&s;e who live the longe&s;t in an intemperate Cour&s;e, might, from the Strength of their Con&s;titution, have lived much longer, had they eat le&s;s, and u&s;ed them&s;elves to drink more Water; which Drink, as it is mo&s;t friendly, and longe&s;t will pre&s;erve the Life of a &s;trong Con&s;titution, &s;o 'tis ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e that are weak and &s;ickly, and are naturally &s;ubject <HI>to the Gout, the Stone, Shortne&s;s of Breath, Wind, Ill Dige&s;tion,</HI> and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>But the chief U&s;e of Water in pre|&s;erving of Health, is by u&s;ing of it as a Vomit, as before was &s;hewn, which is the mo&s;t infallible Remedy that ever was found out for any Stomach-Sickne&s;s, or Pain there; for to vomit with warm
<PB N="55" REF="54">Water will effectually remove it, and be a means to prevent great Fits of Sickne&s;s, and pre&s;erve the Lives of many Thou|&s;ands to Old Age, by clean&s;ing the Sto|mach from that tough, &s;limy, or corrupt Matter that offends, and is the Cau&s;e of all mortal Di&s;ea&s;es; e&s;pecially of an <HI>Apo|plexy,</HI> which tho' counted a Di&s;ea&s;e of the Head, <HI>yet hath its Original from a foul Stomach,</HI> which nothing doth &s;o ef|fectually clean&s;e as Vomits: according to that of Dr. <HI>Curtis,</HI> who &s;aith, That Vo|miting, with warm Water, or <HI>Carduus</HI> Tea, is very beneficial to bring up that which fluctuates in the Stomach, and that tough ropy Phlegm which &s;ticks fa&s;t to the Wrinkles and Foulds of that Bowel, <HI>and which Purges do often pa&s;s over, and cannot remove.</HI> Which way of Vo|miting, with warm Water, is ten times more ea&s;y and plea&s;ant than that which is effected by the U&s;e of a nau&s;eous Tea made of Carduus, which Phy&s;icians do &s;ometimes advi&s;e; and 'tis al&s;o &s;uch as can do no harm by Violence, as other Vo|mits made from Antimony &s;ometimes do.</P>
<P>And here it may not be ami&s;s to relate what I &s;ome Years ago di&s;covered, in order to Mens freeing them&s;elves from Sickne&s;s that may happen after eating; for being invited to dine at a certain Table, where
<PB N="56" REF="55">there were &s;everal good Di&s;hes of Meat, I was over-per&s;uaded to eat more than I &s;hould do, and in a little time after Din|ner found my&s;elf begin to be &s;ick. I went out, and in a private Place attempted to vomit, by tickling my Throat with my Finger, but could not vomit as I de&s;igned to do; only by this means I rai&s;ed up two or three mouthfuls of thick tough Phlegm, upon which I found my&s;elf better, and my &s;ick Qualm went off. I took the Hint it gave me, and have done the &s;ame &s;everal times &s;ince, and find that the get|ting up the Phlegm, which like Ye&s;t up|on Beer works up to the Mouth of the Stomach, a Man may free him&s;elf from &s;ome kinds of Sickne&s;s after eating. And I remember it is an Advice given by one <HI>Vaughan,</HI> in a Book long &s;ince printed, intitled, <HI>Directions for Health,</HI> for Men who feed high, to put their Finger in their Throat when they ri&s;e in the Morn|ing, to make them&s;elves puke, or avoid the Phlegm which can be rai&s;ed, as an excellent way to pre&s;erve Health; and 'tis &s;aid al&s;o to be an ab&s;olute Pre&s;ervative from the Gout.</P>
<P>I will conclude with this Note, That in &s;uch Di&s;tempers where Water-drinking will be available for a Cure, the &s;ame mu&s;t not be drank &s;paringly, but plenti|fully,
<PB N="57" REF="56">as to ea&s;e the Gripings in a Loo&s;ene&s;s or Flux: for if but a Pint of Water &s;hould be drank, Ea&s;e would hardly &s;ucceed; but drinking in about an hour's time a Quart or three Pints, the Sharpne&s;s and evil Quality of the Humour offending will be &s;o far diluted or weakened, that immediate Ea&s;e will follow. If the Sea|&s;on be too cold to drink cold Water, you may warm it a little upon the Fire, or put a hot Toa&s;t of Bread into every Pint; and the &s;ame is true <HI>in Fevers, or in Pains from Gravel or the Cholick;</HI> for a &s;mall Quantity will not be effectual in the&s;e Ca&s;es: which ought carefully to be noted, for in a Fever a little Water will rather in|crea&s;e the Burning, which large Draughts; often drank, will &s;oon take off. <HI>Re&s;t, Fa&s;t|ing, and drinking much Water,</HI> after a Vomit or two, is a Cour&s;e that ne|ver yet hath failed to Cure Fevers, by clearing the Stomach of that &s;ordid Fil|thine&s;s which cau&s;eth the Di&s;temper; for a happy I&s;&s;ue will certainly follow &s;uch a Cour&s;e, if the Fever is &s;imple, and not complicated with other Di&s;tempers, which will re&s;i&s;t all Remedies: and in many Ca&s;es nothing can prevent Mortality, <HI>as is evident by the Death of the be&s;t Phy&s;i|cians as well as others.</HI></P>
<PB N="58" REF="57">
<P>I will add to what hath been &s;aid, one Experiment more, that is very material: And that is, being very <HI>hypochondriacal,</HI> and of a <HI>melancholy Temper,</HI> I have of|ten been &s;trangely dejected in Mind when under Grief, for &s;ome Misfortunes, which &s;ometimes hath been &s;o great, as to threa|ten Danger to Life; in which Fits of Grief I always found the Parts within my Brea&s;t unea&s;y, and &s;ometimes they have continued long: but now I have found a good Remedy, for upon drinking a Pint of cold Water, I find ea&s;e in two or three Mi|nutes, &s;o that no Grief &s;eems to afflict. Which Experience I di&s;cover for the &s;ake of others in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, be|ing verily per&s;uaded that the Seat of Grief is in the Stomach, which &s;ympathizeth with the Mind, and thereby becomes the Cau&s;e of that unea&s;y Sen&s;ation and Pain perceived there; for which, cold Water I have found to be the be&s;t Remedy in my&s;elf, and I believe others may find the &s;ame Benefit, who will make u&s;e thereof upon the like Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Experiment that I have often &s;een of good effect; and that is, that if Per&s;ons &s;ubject to what is cal|led <HI>Vapours,</HI> or that are afflicted with Fits, commonly call'd <HI>The Fits of the
<PB N="59" REF="58">Mother,</HI> will but drink Water when they find their Fits approach, it will imme|diately yield Relief. There is in this ca&s;e a mealy Julep pre&s;cribed by Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> which is to take a Spoonful of fine Wheat Flower, an Ounce of fine Sugar, and a Pint of Water, brew them toge|ther, and drink it off: This is plea&s;anter than Water alone; but Water of it&s;elf will be as effectual, or rather better.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may de&s;ire to know how to di&s;tingui&s;h good from bad Water; and the way to do this, is by the Ta&s;te and Scent: for if it have no Ta&s;te nor Smell, being purely fre&s;h, not &s;alt, nor &s;weeti&s;h, nor ill-&s;cented, 'tis good, provided it be pure and clear; of which kind is the com|mon Water u&s;ed in <HI>London,</HI> when well &s;ettled, or in fair Weather. As for tho&s;e who are curious, and will be at the Charge, they may procure the be&s;t Water for Drink by Di&s;tillation, either in an A|lembick, or in a cold Still u&s;ed in draw|ing any cold Water from Herbs, for no earthy or metallick Sub&s;tance, nor any kind of Salt, will ri&s;e in Di&s;tillation: &s;o that the Water &s;o di&s;tilled will be pure and admirable to drink when cold, and will keep as long from &s;tinking as any of the cold-di&s;tilled Water in the Apotheca|ries Shops; according to what Dr. <HI>Quincy</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="59">hath affirmed about it in his <HI>Di&s;pen&s;a|tory.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have not the Convenience of Di&s;tillation, may boil it a little as they do for <HI>Tea;</HI> for then, when kept a while after it is cold, in will become more fine, by &s;uffering any Mixture contained in it to &s;ettle to the bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el wherein it is contained, and that will ren|der it &s;till more pure.</P>
<P>Since the collecting together the fore|mentioned Accounts, I have met with a Book written by Dr. <HI>Boerhave,</HI> the pre|&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick at <HI>Leyden</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> who affirms, that drinking Wa|ter made very warm is a good Remedy to pacify griping Pains in the Stomach; and that 'tis proper to bathe Wounds in the Face with it, when they come to be ju&s;t healed, &s;o that the Place be kept con|tinually wet, which I conceive is be&s;t done by applying often linnen Cloths wet; and binding them on till they begin to be dry, will prevent Scars: And he &s;aith, that warm Water is better to atte|nuate or thin the Blood than cold Water.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o publi&s;hed a Book of Ex|periments made with Water, by Dr. <HI>Han|cock,</HI> a Divine, call'd <HI>Febri&s;ugum Mag|num;</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="60">wherein he &s;aith, that drinking a Pint or a Quart of cold Water in Bed, will rai&s;e a copious Sweat, and cure all burning Fevers, which at once taking hath done the bu&s;ine&s;s: it will rai&s;e a Sweat without much more Covering than ordinary. And he further affirms, that the &s;ame taken at the beginning of the cold Fit of an Ague, and &s;weating upon it, at two or three times, taking will cure that Di&s;temper. A large Quantity of hot Water, I know, hath been advi&s;ed to hin|der the cold Fit, but the Party was not order'd to &s;weat.</P>
<P>And he &s;aith he hath had long Expe|rience of curing common Colds with cold Water; and this is done by drinking a large Draught of Water at going to bed, another in the Night, and another in the Morning: which, he &s;aith, will &s;oon thic|ken and &s;weeten, and dige&s;t that thin &s;harp Rheum, that provokes Coughing to no purpo&s;e; for the Rheum, when thin, is hard to be brought up, but when thic|ken'd, it will come up ea&s;ily, and the Cough will &s;oon go off. Which agrees with what I before affirmed from my own long Experience.</P>
<P>He al&s;o affirms from his own Expe|rience, that u&s;ing &s;ometimes to take a
<PB N="62" REF="61">Walk of eight or ten Miles in a Morning, he found that Water gave twice as good Breath for that purpo&s;e as Wine or Ale; and if it would do this for a Man who had no A&s;thma, he doubts not but it would do the &s;ame in one troubled with one. And he al&s;o affirms Water to be the be&s;t Remedy for a Surfeit, to the truth of which I can te&s;tify by long Ex|perience.</P>
<P>He al&s;o affirms, that drinking cold Wa|ter hath been found good in Rheuma|ti&s;ms, and that to one &s;o afflicted he had advi&s;ed to drink it as he lay in his Bed, and it took off the Fit; but if hot Water attenuates the Blood mo&s;t, as <HI>Boerhave</HI> affirms, 'tis then be&s;t to drink of it warm daily to a good quantity: for, as <HI>Pitcairn</HI> ob&s;erves, 'tis then the be&s;t Di&s;&s;olver of all kinds of Salts in the Body, which it will carry off in the Urine, if drank plen|tifully; for by Urine all Salts are eva|cuated.</P>
<P>And it is his Opinion, from the long Experience he hath had of the Effect of Water in keeping the Stomach in order, and making it tight and &s;trong to perform its Operations, and dige&s;t all Humours, that it will cure the Gout in the Stomach; and perhaps it may do it better than
<PB N="63" REF="62">Wine, which I have known to fail. And I do not wonder that the &s;ame Liquor which is the principal Cau&s;e of the Gout in other Parts, &s;hould not be a help in that Part, but rather kill, as it often is found to do.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he affirms, and that with great rea&s;on, that Sweating in Fevers by drinking cold Water, is more natural than to do it with hot Sudorificks, which often do harm in the beginning of Fevers, ex|cept good &s;tore of cooling moi&s;tening Li|quors are drank with them, they being more apt to inflame, than cool and quench Heat in the Body; and for that rea&s;on it hath not been often advi&s;ed by Phy&s;icians, becau&s;e they were ignorant of this cold way of Sweating to cure Fevers.</P>
<P>Which Cure, he &s;aid, did &s;ucceed in one who was his Relation, at the fifth Day after his falling &s;ick; to whom he gave a Do&s;e of Water after he was in bed, and he &s;weated profu&s;ely for 24 Hours, and thereby was cured. Half a Pint, he &s;aith, is enough for a grown Child: a Pint to a Man or Woman, tho if they drink a Quart, it will be better. In Scarlet-Fevers, Small-Pox, Mea&s;les, tho the Water will not cau&s;e Sweat, yet it will &s;o quell and keep under the Fever, that the Eruptions will
<PB N="64" REF="63">come out more kindly, which is a Confir|mation of what before was &s;aid about Dr. <HI>Betts</HI>'s pre&s;cribing two Quarts of Water when the Small-Pox did not come out kindly.</P>
<P>And he &s;ets down an Account of the <HI>Author of the Free-Thinker,</HI> concerning a Woman, who in the la&s;t great Plague fell ill of that Di&s;temper, who got her Hu&s;|band to fetch her a Pitcher of Water from <HI>Lamb's-Conduit;</HI> &s;he drank plentifully of it, but did not avoid the Cold, and &s;o did not &s;weat, however &s;he was cured. And he gives us another Relation of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> formerly Re&s;ident at <HI>Morocco,</HI> that fell ill of the Plague at that Place, and getting Water to drink, fell into a vi|olent Sweat, and recover'd: from whence he concludes that Water is good in the Plague.</P>
<P>I will here add to what the Doctor hath &s;aid concerning the Cure of Fevers, That if the Fever be accompanied in the beginning with any Illne&s;s at the Stomach nau&s;eating or vomiting, it will be the &s;u|re&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Practice to clear the Sto|mach fir&s;t, by vomiting with warm Wa|ter, as before hath been pre&s;cribed; for I cannot believe it po&s;&s;ible for the Stomach to be cleared from foul Humours by
<PB N="65" REF="64">&s;weating: it may do, if no great &s;en&s;e of Di&s;order is perceived there, but it will certainly be &s;afe&s;t to clean&s;e the Stomach fir&s;t, which is the Place where all Di&s;|ea&s;es are originally begun; for then &s;weating with cold Water afterwards may turn to good account. Indeed I have not made any trial of it &s;ince the Doctor's Book was publi&s;hed, but I have a very good opinion of his Experience upon all the Accounts therein given concerning the Benefit of Water, having had &s;o much Experience thereof in my own Practice for above forty Years; for &s;o long it is &s;ince I fir&s;t began to collect tho&s;e Ac|counts, and make tho&s;e Experiments, which are herein made publick for the Be|nefit of all.</P>
<P>And thus, for the common Good of Mankind of all Ranks and Degrees, I have collected together all the Accounts I have ob&s;erved in Phy&s;ick-Books relating to the U&s;e of common Water in preventing and curing Di&s;ea&s;es; to which I have added &s;ome Experiments, which by numerous Trials I can warrant as &s;ure and certain, e&s;pecially that of curing any Sickne&s;s in the Stomach upon the Spot, by vomiting with warm Water: which is an Experi|ment, that, if put into common Practice, would prevent many thou&s;and Fits of
<PB N="66" REF="65">Sickne&s;s in a year among Mankind, and a great number of untimely Deaths; for it takes away the Cau&s;e of all Stomach-Sickne&s;s, which is the Root of, or fir&s;t Beginning of mo&s;t of the Evils that afflict the Body.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude all with this Adverti&s;e|ment, That if this finds a kind Acceptance, the Author intends to publi&s;h a Collection he hath made out of the be&s;t Writings relating to Phy&s;ick, of &s;uch Receipts as are mo&s;t commended in all Di&s;tempers, and made up of the fewe&s;t Ingredients, and ea&s;ie&s;t to be had, all reduced under their proper Heads; which, I doubt not, will prove very u&s;eful on many accounts, be|yond any Collection of that nature. The Collection was begun above forty Years &s;ince for my own u&s;e, without any de&s;ign originally to make them publick; but &s;ince we are not born for our&s;elves only, I am per&s;uaded to let others partake of the Be|nefit of my Labour, if I can do it with the Pro&s;pect of any &s;uitable Encourage|ment, from the kind Reception this may meet with among tho&s;e who de&s;ire Health, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h is be&s;t attained to by the mo&s;t un|compounded Remedies in times of Sick|ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Some <HI>RULES</HI> for pre|&s;erving Health by Diet, collected from Phy&s;ical Authors.</HEAD>
<P>_IN a little Treati&s;e, entitled, <HI>Kitchin-Phy&s;ick,</HI> written by Dr. <HI>Cook,</HI> the Author declares, he can hardly be told of any Di&s;ea&s;e which he cannot relieve or cure, by a proper Diet, <HI>p.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">. And in the &s;ame Book we find his Opinion to be this, That all tender &s;ickly People, and all aged and decrepid Per&s;ons, ought to eat often, and but a little at a time, becau&s;e weak and wa&s;ted Bodies are to be re&s;tored by little and little; and by moi&s;t and liquid Food al&s;o, rather than by &s;olid, becau&s;e moi&s;t and liquid Diet does nouri&s;h &s;oone&s;t, and dige&s;t ea&s;ie&s;t.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="67">
<P>Tho&s;e, he &s;aith, that eat much, and get little Strength by eating, &s;hew, that they have u&s;ed them&s;elves to too full a Diet; and the more you cramb &s;uch Bodies, the le&s;s they thrive by it, but rather grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e: becau&s;e by much feeding you do but add to the bad Humours wherewith the Body is already filled, which &s;hould rather be wa&s;ted by purging a little, and u&s;ing a &s;pare Diet.</P>
<P>And a &s;pare Diet he de&s;cribes to be this, That we never eat at once till the Appe|tite is fully &s;atisfied, and never to eat till you have an Appetite; and Men never have a true Appetite till they have a De|&s;ire to eat any ordinary Food, or that a Piece of Bread will plea&s;e the Reli&s;h of the Tongue: And he advi&s;eth to keep con&s;tantly to a plain Diet; for tho&s;e, he &s;ays, enjoy mo&s;t Health, and live longe&s;t, <HI>that avoid Curio&s;ity and Variety of Meats and Drinks,</HI> which only &s;erve to entice to Gluttony, and &s;o work our Ruin.</P>
<P>Another &s;aith, that liquid Meats are better for weakly People than &s;olid, and the le&s;s Food the &s;ick Per&s;on eats, the &s;ooner he will recover; for 'tis a true Saying, <HI>The more you fill foul Bodies, the more you hurt them.</HI> The Stomach being the Place where Di&s;ea&s;es begin, when that Part therefore is weak, and out of order, and cannot make a good Dige&s;tion, raw or
<PB N="69" REF="68">crude Humours mu&s;t needs be bred, and bad Humours cannot produce good Blood.</P>
<P>All Men do find by Experience, that in the Morning before they have eaten, they are light and plea&s;antly ea&s;y in their Bo|dies; but after they have indulged their Appetites with Plenty of Food, they find them&s;elves heavy and dull, and often &s;leepy: which &s;ufficiently &s;hews that tho&s;e full Meals are prejudicial to the Welfare of the Body; for a moderate Meal would have continued the Ea&s;e and Light&s;omne&s;s they before found in them&s;elves, and would have refre&s;hed any Faintne&s;s that Emptine&s;s might occa&s;ion. And he cer|tainly, who u&s;eth the mo&s;t &s;imple Meats and Drinks, avoideth the Snare of pro|voking his Appetite beyond the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature; whereas Variety enticeth to a fre&s;h De&s;ire of every Dainty, till at la&s;t the Stomach is gorged, and made uncapa|ble of performing a good Dige&s;tion; and this produceth tho&s;e Crudities, which are the Cau&s;e of all Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>'Tis generally ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t unhealthy among the Gentry are tho&s;e who feed high upon the mo&s;t delicious Dain|ties, and drink nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t &s;pirituous Liquors; whereas the Poor, who want this delicate Fare, and never eat of their own plain Diet to Ex|ce&s;s, are &s;eldom &s;ick, except they have
<PB N="70" REF="69">&s;uch un&s;atiable Appetites as to eat too much, which a Man may do of the plain|e&s;t Diet, who&s;e Belly is his God.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Pratt</HI> advi&s;eth to &s;up &s;paringly; for to &s;up &s;paringly, he &s;aith, is mo&s;t health|ful, becau&s;e of the Experience of an infi|nite Number of Per&s;ons who have re|ceived the greate&s;t Benefit from light Suppers. For the Stomach being not over|burdened, the Sleep is more plea&s;ant; and from &s;paring Suppers the breeding of tho&s;e Humours are prevented, which cau&s;e Defluxions, Rheumati&s;ms, Gouts, Drop&s;ies, Giddine&s;s, and Corruption in the Mouth from the Scurvey is prevent|ed; and from light Suppers a Freedom from Sickne&s;s and Reaching in the Morn|ing is obtained, and Concoction is made perfect, which prevent Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Another &s;aith, It is well known, that many Indi&s;po&s;itions are cured by Fa&s;ting, or a very &s;pare Diet; for what is taken into the Stomach being no more than can be well dige&s;ted, the chylous Juice, &s;o prepared, is conveyed into the Lacteal Ve&s;&s;els, and from thence into the Blood: &s;o that Nature being duly &s;upplied with well-prepared Nouri&s;hment, the corrupted Blood will get free from that Corruption in time, by throwing it out, through the Pores of the Skin, by Per&s;piration, and &s;upply it&s;elf with the purer Juices; and
<PB N="71" REF="70">in this way Con&s;umptions and Scurveys, and other Chronical Di&s;tempers, will be overcome.</P>
<P>That Men in Health may prevent Di&s;|ea&s;es, 'twas advi&s;ed, that one Meal &s;hould not be eaten, till the other, which was eaten before, was pa&s;&s;ed off clean out of the Stomach; which never is done till the Appetite of Hunger is found to call for another Supply: by means of which con|&s;tant Ob&s;ervation, the Food will be con|verted into good Chyle, and from good Chyle, <HI>which is a milky Sub&s;tance,</HI> good Blood will be bred, and from good Blood generous Spirits will be produced, out of which a healthy Con&s;titution will en&s;ue; but, on the contrary, too great a Quanti|ty of Food being taken for plea&s;ure only, which the Stomach cannot well dige&s;t, the Chyle will be raw and corrupt, which will foul the Blood, and render the Body di&s;orderly and unhealthful.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that Ab&s;tinence and Sobri|ety free from mo&s;t Diea&s;es, e&s;pecially <HI>Ca|tarrhs, Coughs, Whee&s;ings, Giddine&s;s, Pain in the Head and Stomach, &s;udden Death, Lethargies, Gout,</HI> and <HI>Sciatica,</HI> an ill Dige&s;tion being the Cau&s;e of all the&s;e; it al&s;o prevents <HI>Pain in the Spleen, Stone, and Gravel, and a dry Itch;</HI> it makes the Body vigorous and nimble, maintains the five Sen&s;es in a good State, pre&s;erveth the Memory, quickens the
<PB N="72" REF="71">Wit, and quencheth all undue Lu&s;t in Mankind.</P>
<P>Two Meals a day is &s;ufficient for all Per&s;ons after fifty Years of Age, and all weak People; for the omitting of Suppers, does always conduce much to the Health of the Weak and Aged: &s;ince if no Sup|per be eaten, the Stomach will &s;oon free it&s;elf from all tough &s;limy Humours wherewith it is &s;labbered over on the In|&s;ide, and thereby the Appetite will be renewed, and Dige&s;tion made more &s;trong and vigorous. Moreover, all that are troubled with Sweating in the Night, any ill Ta&s;te in their Mouths, belching, and trouble&s;ome Dreams, mu&s;t avoid Sup|pers; for in Sleep the Fibres of the Sto|mach relax, and are not able to contract them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly, as when awake, to embrace the Food, and by Trituration reduce it into a Pap fit to pa&s;s out into the other Bowels, called <HI>the Guts,</HI> out of which the Nouri&s;hment is &s;ent to other Parts.</P>
<P>'Twas &s;aid by Dr. <HI>Curtis,</HI> that though tho&s;e, who u&s;e a &s;pare Diet, cannot well bear long Labour; yet &s;uch People, when their Exerci&s;e is &s;uitable to their Strength, do live longer than tho&s;e of a robu&s;t Con&s;titution, that think large feeding adds Strength; e&s;pecially &s;uch as being &s;trong, u&s;e no Exerci&s;e proportionable to it, to con&s;ume the Superfluities which a
<PB N="73" REF="72">full Feeding doth occa&s;ion; which is the Ca&s;e of Men of great E&s;tates, who live longe&s;t to enjoy them, and do good with them, the more temperate they live.</P>
<P>This Temperance doth con&s;i&s;t in not letting the common Cu&s;tom of Meals in|vite you to eat, except your Appetite concur with tho&s;e Times. We mu&s;t not indulge the Cravings of a depraved Ap|petite, as tho&s;e do who eat to plea&s;e their Fancy, and not the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature; and when we do eat, we mu&s;t not think that the more plentifully we eat, we &s;hall be more &s;trengthened, for it will not prove &s;o: a little well dige&s;ted will make the Body &s;tronger, than the being glutted with Superfluity, mo&s;t of which will be turned into a corrupt Juice, and mu&s;t be ca&s;t out, or el&s;e Sickne&s;s will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>It is the Opinion of learned Men, that the early Di&s;temper of the Body, called <HI>the Rickets,</HI> proceeds from the Fault of their Mothers, in making them Gluttons from their Cradles, gorging them with Food till they loath it, out of a mi&s;taken Opinion, that this is the way to make them thrive and grow &s;trong: which Exce&s;s is not only the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e, but of the immature Death of many; and in others it lays the Foun|dation of many Di&s;tempers, which afflict them afterwards who live to Years of
<PB N="74" REF="73">Maturity; and as they gorge them with Food, &s;o they vainly think to cheri&s;h them with &s;trong Drink, <HI>than which no|thing can be more pernicious to the Health of Children;</HI> who&s;e Diet &s;hould be little and often, and their Drink cool|ing: As it al&s;o &s;hould be when they ar|rive at the time of becoming new Chil|dren in Old Age; that is, in an helple&s;s State, which &s;hould be prevented as much as can be, by a cooling moi&s;tening Diet, in oppo&s;ition to the hot, and dry, and withered State of their &s;econd Childhood; for 'tis then Heat and Dryne&s;s that are the Cau&s;e of mo&s;t of their Mi&s;eries, and the wa&s;ting of the Sub&s;tance that fills the Parts with Moi&s;ture, and keeps the Body plump.</P>
<P>It was the Opinion of Dr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> who was formerly Phy&s;ician to St. <HI>Bartholo|mew</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> that Fa&s;ting, Re&s;t, and drinking Water would cure mo&s;t Di&s;ea|&s;es; and there &s;eemeth to be a great deal of Rea&s;on in what he a&s;&s;erted. For Fa&s;ting will give time to the Stomach to unload it&s;elf of the Cau&s;e of Di&s;tem|pers, the Cau&s;e of all Di&s;ea&s;es being be|gun in that Bowel only; to which clean|&s;ing, the drinking of Water plentifully will much contribute, which al&s;o will keep the Action of the Stomach upon the Hinges, by filling of it when empty, at which time there will be need of Re&s;t,
<PB N="75" REF="74">for thereby the Body will be le&s;s fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s: tho the mere drinking of Wa|ter, <HI>which affords Nouri&s;hment &s;ufficient for the Growth and Support of all Ve|getables,</HI> will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply the want of Food, <HI>as hath been &s;hewn in the Example of two, who were &s;up|ported a long time by nothing el&s;e.</HI> In &s;hort, the be&s;t way for a &s;ick Man to recover, is to eat no Food till he finds an Appetite, according to that Saying,</P>

<P>And fa&s;ting from Food may be continued long enough to be a Remedy for many Di&s;ea&s;es, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of common Water; by the drinking of which hot, in a due Quantity, without a total Fa&s;ting, two Per&s;ons, I am informed, were reco|vered out of Con&s;umptions, by which they were extremely weakened, and that in about &s;ix Weeks time; as was another by drinking Milk and Whey, equal Parts, made blood hot, without u&s;ing any o|ther Diet, which is thought to be far more effectual than A&s;&s;es Milk.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides a &s;pare Diet, good cool dry Air is al&s;o very helpful to pre&s;erve Men in Health, for it mixes with the Blood, and without it the Motion of the Blood and Spirits can never be pre&s;erved, as ap|pears
<PB N="76" REF="75">by Diving-Ve&s;&s;els, in which Men cannot live when the Air therein is made hot by their own Body and Breath: And is proved al&s;o by an Experiment of Dr. <HI>Crone's,</HI> who &s;tifled a Chicken, till it &s;eem'd quite dead; and yet by blowing cool Air into the Lungs, with a &s;mall Pair of Bellows, it revived. Hence it ap|pears, that the common Cu&s;tom of ma|naging &s;ick People is very pernicious, and &s;o far from helping them to recover, that 'tis &s;ufficient to make a healthy Per&s;on &s;ick; for were a Per&s;on, who was not &s;ick, confined for three or four Weeks in a Room, made hot like a Stove, and confined to his Bed, with the Curtains drawn, and all the Windows clo&s;e &s;hut, and perfumed with the nau&s;eous Fumes of Phy&s;ick, which will almo&s;t make a fre&s;h Man &s;ick when he ju&s;t enters into it; we can never think that this is the way to recover one that really is &s;ick, and wants the fre&s;h Air to cheri&s;h his Blood; <HI>a fre&s;h open Air being the principal means to &s;trengthen the Body, make a good Appe|tite and Dige&s;tion, and render the Spi|rits brisk and lively:</HI> which Advantage &s;hould be allowed to all but Childbed Women, and tho&s;e who are afflicted with the Small-Pox; for the fre&s;h Air can be prejudicial to no other, who&s;e Bodies are clothed warm, either in Bed, or &s;itting up.</P>
