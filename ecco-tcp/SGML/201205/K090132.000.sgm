<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_SINCE I pre&s;ent this Book to the World in general, with|out dedicating it to any Per|&s;on to protect me, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething in my own De|fence.</P>
<P>What I write is from Remarks on Na|ture, and Practical Ob&s;ervations, with an Intention to improve the Method of cur|ing Di&s;ea&s;es; for the Art of healing is in a declining Way, the Practice of Phy&s;ick, is become a Perfect Ceremony; that &s;trong Beam, which ought to &s;upport it, is di|vided into different Branches: Here is one Man &s;hall be a Phy&s;ician, another a Sur|geon, one an Apothecary, another a Chy|mi&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus (in this pre&s;ent Age) each
<PB N="4" REF="3">Man &s;ticks to his particular Branch, and thinks it Scandal to meddle or interfere, with any more than one Part only; but in former Ages, a Man was not deem'd worthy to be call'd a Phy&s;ician, unle&s;s he was Ma&s;|ter of every one of the&s;e following Arts.</P>
<P><HI>(Fir&s;t.)</HI> Phy&s;iology, or a Knowledge of Human Nature.</P>
<P><HI>(Secondly.)</HI> Anatomy, or a Knowledge of the Parts of Human Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>(Thirdly.)</HI> Pharmacy and Chymi&s;try, or the Method of making all manner of Me|dicines.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Fir&s;t and Principal Point is, judging and di&s;tingui&s;hing the Di&s;|ea&s;es, and Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es ; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Phy&s;ician to be perfect in this Point, until he is perfect in Ana|tomy and Surgery: For I call Surgery the Practical Part of Anatomy; there being more Experience gain'd from Accidental Practice and Ob&s;ervations upon living Bo|dies, than from Lectures and Cour&s;es of Anatomy over dead Bodies.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e it is as nece&s;&s;ary for a Phy&s;ici|an, to know the different Qualities of Me|dicines,
<PB N="5" REF="4">that he may be able to relieve the different Di&s;orders which Human Bodies are afflicted with: Therefore, every Prac|titioner ought to know the preparing of all Kind of Medicines, for both Internal and External U&s;es; becau&s;e the Maker of Me|dicines, or Things of any Kind, is mo&s;t able to know the Power of &s;uch Things as he him&s;elf hath made.</P>
<P><HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> call'd Phy&s;ick a Short Art, meaning, that when it is Short and Ea&s;y it is mo&s;t Perfect: For where the Prac|tice is long and tedious, the Patient &s;uf|fers; and when Writings are long and te|dious, the Reader's Mind is no Ways im|prov'd thereby: but Books are too com|monly e&s;teem'd according to the Fame of the Author, and when any Thing new is publi&s;h'd, the fir&s;t Enquiry is, who is the Author? In&s;tead of, what has he wrote?</P>
<P>Although I &s;ay &s;omething in Oppo&s;iti|on to the pre&s;ent Rules in Phy&s;ick, I do not ri&s;e up again&s;t the Phy&s;icians in general; for I know &s;ome Excellent Men in Prac|tice, who&s;e Methods I always ob&s;erv'd to improve my own Thoughts, &s;o far I am in|debted;
<PB N="6" REF="5">therefore I will &s;ay nothing that &s;hall offend the Wi&s;e and Worthy; but a|gain&s;t Ignorance and Envy there can be no Defence, &s;ince People will always have dif|ferent Ta&s;tes; &s;ome Per&s;ons like a Surgeon for being diligent in dre&s;&s;ing a Green Wound, twice a Day, when certainly, the oftner a Green Wound is open'd, the longer it mu&s;t be before it heals, becau&s;e the Air makes a Wound more tender, and hinders the Fibres from uniting. Others like a Phy|&s;ician, under who&s;e Care they are always &s;ick.</P>
<P>And &s;ome People like to read Books, which confound their Under&s;tanding; I might name a certain Author, in great E&s;teem, who at his Beginning, takes up five Pages in explaining the Word Di&s;|ea&s;e; now I will explain the meaning of the Word, Di&s;ea&s;e, in a few Lines.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I find a Per&s;on unea&s;y, I may then &s;ay he has a Di&s;-ea&s;e, becau&s;e he is not at Ea&s;e; and &s;o may we &s;ay of Tem|per, and Di&s;-temper. Thus I would make the Path of Practice, Plain and Ea&s;y, there|fore, I will begin fir&s;t with the Nerves and Sen&s;es, by way of Introduction.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE ob&s;erv'd that &s;eve|ral Authors who have wrote upon the Animal Spirits, with|out explaining them&s;elves, have been ridicul'd and condemn'd, for picking out an Ab&s;tru&s;e Term, to build an Argument upon; and as my Thoughts may lead me to make u&s;e of that Term, I will tell the Reader what I mean thereby; in Hopes it may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure defend me from Calumny, or at lea&s;t vindicate other Authors: For certainly every Man has an Idea of what he writes; indeed he may not mea&s;ure it out to the Under&s;tand|ing of every Reader.</P>
<P>Therefore, when I &s;ay the Animal Spi|rits, I mean the Principal Seat of Know|ledge, where the Prime Sen&s;e gives imme|diate Judgment between Pain and Plea|&s;ure;
<PB N="8" REF="7">and the&s;e following Gates, lead there|to, as, Seeing, Hearing, Ta&s;ting, Smelling, and Feeling.</P>
<P>Yet the Mind, or Animal Spirits, can conceive either Fear, Grief, or Joy, with|out drawing it in by any of tho&s;e Organs; but when one Per&s;on infects another, with either Fear, Joy, or Pain, it mu&s;t then be carried to the Prime Seat of Know|ledge, by &s;ome one of the five Sen&s;es: And when any Hurt or Surprize, Infecti|on of Fear, or Malignity of any Kind, reaches the Animal Spirits, or the Prime Seat of Sen&s;e, from thence is &s;hewn an Antipathy in all the Nerves, by a rigorous &s;hivering and &s;haking of every Mu&s;cle, throughout the whole Body; and it is then (as in Holy Writ) that the Keepers of the Hou&s;e &s;hall tremble, Fears being in the Way.</P>
<P>Now I mu&s;t own, the <HI>Liquidum Ner|vorum,</HI> (or rather the Nerves them&s;elves) may properly be call'd the Animal Spirits.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>But nearer to the Fountain Head,</HI></L>
<L><HI>More Cry&s;tal flows the Silver Stream.</HI></L>
</LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>For certainly the Nerves are govern'd by the Mind, and Force or Quickne&s;s of Thought, as is plainly demon&s;trated, when we catch a flying Ball, or when we defend our Heads from a Blow, our Arm is then mov'd by the Nerves guiding the Mu&s;cles, yet the Nerves are directed by the Mind; for although the Performances and OEco|nomy of the Nerves, are noble, they are not de&s;ign'd (by Nature) to contract, or extend a Mu&s;cle, without Order from the Mind, or Prime Seat of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover when it happens (contrary to Nature) that any of the Nerves contract a Mu&s;cle, without Commi&s;&s;ion from the Mind, that Mu&s;cle &s;o mov'd, is then cramp'd, or in Convul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Therefore as the Mind commands the Nerves, the Mind or Thought, mu&s;t be the Animal Spirit; likewi&s;e the Mind mu&s;t be the Throne of the Soul.</P>
<P>Thus in pur&s;uit of Nature, as one hard Cau&s;e we overtake, &s;till harder &s;tand before us; &s;o from Cau&s;e to Cau&s;e, our Thoughts are led, even to that mighty Power, the
<PB N="10" REF="9">Sun, by who&s;e Beams we live, move, and generate.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Without that Warmth, and lively Light,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So mortal Cold this Globe would be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That Nature mu&s;t in Darkne&s;s fix,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And every Thing that's living dye.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>For the Sun is Nature's Lord, the fir&s;t Power from God, and the only Cau&s;e of the Cour&s;e and Changes of Things on this Earth.</P>
<P>The Moon has no Influence over Hu|man Bodies, nor over any Thing on this Globe: Indeed, the Tide keeps Time with the Moon; but it is becau&s;e the Moon and the Earth both, have the &s;ame Circular Motion to the Sun.</P>
<P>I would demon&s;trate how the Tide, is caus'd, by the Atmo&s;phere pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the Sea, as the Earth moves; and how the Wind, and Combu&s;tions of Weather, are caus'd by a Fermentation in the At|mo&s;phere; but it would be tedious here, and keep me from what I propo&s;e, which is chiefly to treat on Di&s;tempers, and Hu|man Nature.</P>

<HEAD>Of Malignant Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS commonly call'd Ma|lignant, being in their Nature mo&s;t &s;ubtle and &s;evere, which prey upon the Animal Spirits, &s;ome Time before the Blood is infected.</P>
<P>This Kind of Fever does not proceed from contagious Particles in the Air; nor is it infectious any otherwi&s;e, than by our being afraid of it, and thus it gets Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion into the Prime Fancy or Animal Spirits, by conceiving a Fear of Death within our&s;elves, upon any &s;light Illne&s;s, or &s;udden Surprize of Danger; and the mo&s;t dangerous Symptom is, when the Thoughts have drawn in an Apprehen&s;i|on and Dread of Death, upon the Spirits; for without this Dread, it is not a real Malignant Fever.</P>
<P>The Sick is &s;eiz'd at fir&s;t, with a Shi|vering and Coldne&s;s, a weary Pain and Weakne&s;s, throughout the whole Body, proceeding from that Di&s;order upon the Nerves and Spinal Marrow, which ren|der
<PB N="12" REF="11">the Sinews and Mu&s;cles incapable of doing their Offices; likewi&s;e a continual reaching to vomit, and a Watchfulne&s;s upon the Spirits, which hinders him from &s;leeping, although he's attended with a great Drow&s;ine&s;s, the&s;e are the Symptoms of a Malignant Fever, at the fir&s;t Ap|proach, before the Blood is inflam'd. The Patient &s;hould then by all means &s;ubmit him&s;elf to his Bed, and not &s;trive again&s;t Nature; for &s;he will not be conquer'd.</P>
<P>Now a Phy&s;ician being call'd, he pre|&s;cribes according to his Judgment, for Phy&s;icians differ in their Methods of Practice, as they do in their Opinions, and full as much as Human Bodies differ in their Con&s;titutions; &s;ome will boldly give purging Medicines, others give Su|dori&s;icks, and &s;ome Bli&s;ter more and more, even to the la&s;t Ga&s;p.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to be a Pilot; I only wi&s;h the Wanderer may know, which Path will mi&s;lead him; as for Bli&s;tering, I cannot &s;ee why it &s;hould do any Hurt, yet I may rea&s;onably make an Objection, &s;ince Practice has convinc'd me, that Bli|&s;ters
<PB N="13" REF="12">afford no Relief in real Malignant Fevers. Purging is an Ignorant Proceed|ing, and dangerous; for all &s;udden Eva|cuations, or immoderate Di&s;charges, add to the Rigour and Anxiety of the Mind, therefore mu&s;t tend to de&s;troy Life, ra|ther than &s;ave. Sudorificks are very proper, if we u&s;e &s;uch as may bring on gentle Sweats; for if the Sweats come on exce&s;&s;ively, Nature will be reduced &s;o low, as to be pa&s;t defending her&s;elf, &s;o Critical are the&s;e Malignant Fevers; and likewi&s;e if we find a Difficulty in bring|ing the Patient to &s;weat, we mu&s;t forbear heating Medicines, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall put the Blood into a violent Ebullition, and hurry the Patient out of the World, when perhaps, if he had been &s;upply'd with a proper Regimen, yielding to Nature, he might have recover'd, by the Help of gentle Cardiack, and Diluting Medicines. The <HI>Lapis Contrayerva,</HI> and Te&s;tace|ous Powders repeated often, and given in a Julep of Black-Cherry Water, Syrup of Saffron and Compound Piony Water, will help to correct the Acidity in the Sto|mach
<PB N="14" REF="13">and cheri&s;h the Animal Spirits; for if we can find out how, and where Nature is oppre&s;s'd, we then mu&s;t u&s;e Means to &s;et her Free, that &s;he may (on her own Accord) bring on &s;uch Sweats, as are not only nece&s;&s;ary and wonder|ful, but highly preferable to all that can be forc'd by Art.</P>
<P>The only Sudorifick Medicine that I ever found effectual in Malignant and Pe&s;tilential Fevers, is the Elixir of Vipers, as I have &s;et down in the Chapter of In|flammatory Fevers; in it, there is a &s;ubtle Virtue, which never fails to bring on the Moderate and Nece&s;&s;ary Sweats, and as if it were a Specifick, temperates the Ani|mal Spirits, without augmenting the Heat in the Blood: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et a Rule to practi&s;e by, in either Acute or Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es; nor even how to or|der a proper Regimen, or a fit Liquor for the Patient in a Malignant Fever; per|haps the Phy&s;ician may order Chicken Broth, which certainly is very proper, if the Patient can drink as much as his Fe|ver requires; but after he has drank one
<PB N="15" REF="14">Sort of Liquor five of &s;ix Times, he bears &s;o great an Antipathy to it, that his Stomach will not take the &s;ame Liquor any longer, yet he is confin'd to it for &s;everal Days; this Way of re&s;training the Patient to one Sort of Liquor, is barbarous, if rightly con&s;ider'd; for we &s;hould endeavour to find out which Sort of Liquor he likes, and divert him with Variety of Liquors; fir&s;t one Sort, and then another. By this Means, he will drink as much as is Nece&s;&s;ary: Proper Liquors in Fevers are Broths, Sage-Tea, Sack-Whey, Pectoral Drinks, White Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, if the Patient &s;hould have a Longing, or De&s;ire for a Draught of Small Beer, we &s;hould by all means let him have it, with a Piece of Bread put into it burn|ing hot: This &s;ometimes is of &s;ingular Ser|vice, by affording a Satisfaction to the Mind; for every Thing that is grateful to a Per&s;on in a Fever, gives a Courage and better enables him to endure his Afflic|tion.</P>
<P>It may be of &s;ome Weight, to &s;et down the Qualifications of a Good Nur&s;e, one who is chearful, obedient, and watch|ful;
<PB N="16" REF="15">not one that reads, &s;ighs, and whi&s;|pers in the Room, as if &s;he was talking to a Spirit: but this I mention by the bye, becau&s;e the Patient never &s;leeps in a Ma|lignant Fever, being &s;o very watchful he on|ly &s;lumbers, and when he hears any Whi&s;|pering, he is affrighted, and commonly &s;tarts up to li&s;ten; &s;o it infects his Thoughts with fre&s;h Dreads, and thus it hurts him, becau&s;e the Malignity of this Fever is Rigour and Fears upon the Mind or Ani|mal Spirits; therefore I advi&s;e the Nur&s;e to &s;peak out briskly, or be quite &s;ilent, likewi&s;e to move briskly, or &s;it quite &s;till.</P>
<P>But, as I was &s;aying before, how un&s;ea|&s;onably Proper Remedies may be apply'd, as in this Fever, Bleeding may be of great Service, when the Blood comes to too High a Fermentation, but if on the con|trary we &s;hould bleed at the fir&s;t Approach of the Di&s;ea&s;e, we &s;hall thereby conceal the Fever upon the Spirits, and depre&s;s Nature, in&s;omuch that the Patient dyes in a Languid Manner.</P>
<P>Nor do I digre&s;s by bringing in compara|tively, how improper it would be, to give
<PB N="17" REF="16">the Je&s;uit's Bark in the Cold &s;hivering Fit of an Intermittent Fever. I might note &s;e|veral other Proofs, while I am treating of Malignant Fevers, &s;ince the Word Ma|lign alludes to all that is unfavourable, &s;evere, and dangerous; yet I will explain the Nature of Pe&s;tilential, and Inflammato|ry Fevers, the Small Pox, and other Di|&s;tempers, &s;ingularly and faithfully, as far as I have ob&s;erv'd, by looking from one Cau&s;e into another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Pe&s;tilential Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>PE&s;tilential Fevers are in no wi&s;e more dangerous, than the Fever de&s;crib'd in the foregoing Chapter, although the Name may &s;ound more terrible. Indeed Pe&s;tilential Fevers are very fatal in one Re&s;pect, by running through whole Fa|milies and Towns, for &s;everal Miles, as if the Air was loaded with Contagious Particles.</P>
<P>I believe, the wi&s;e&s;t Men that ever wrote were always lo&s;t by looking into
<PB N="18" REF="17">the Cau&s;es and Nature of Infection; and as &s;everal Authors have attempted it, I will venture to give my Opinion, in Hopes it may, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, conduct tho&s;e Men into right Notions, that are capable of judging mine to be wrong.</P>
<P>Then in my way of Thinking, Infecti|on mo&s;t commonly is drawn into Hu|man Bodies, by the Power of Sympathy and Antipathy, working upon the Nerves or the Mind: As for Example; when one Per&s;on complains to another, that he feels an unwhole&s;ome Rawne&s;s in the Air; the other whom he complains to, will be apt to draw the &s;ame Notion into his own Mind; likewi&s;e when one in Company gapes or yawns for Sleep, others in the &s;ame Company, who bear the lea&s;t Sympathy to Drow&s;ine&s;s, will be &s;oon &s;eiz'd with the like gaping or yawning; be&s;ides, it is worth ob&s;erving, how a Dampne&s;s in a Room ju&s;t wa&s;h'd, or Damp Linen hanging in a Room, will infect tho&s;e who bear an Antipathy thereto, yet it very &s;eldom hurts tho&s;e who are in no wi&s;e afraid of &s;uch like Dampne&s;&s;es; and al&s;o, as the Sweet
<PB N="19" REF="18">Notes, and Swells in Mu&s;ick, only ele|vates &s;uch Souls as feel its Charms, &s;o any Particulr Impurene&s;s in the Air, can on|ly infect &s;uch Bodies as are fit to receive that Kind of Impurene&s;s; and thus it comes to pa&s;s, that the Small Pox cannot infect tho&s;e who have had the Small Pox before, becau&s;e their Bodies are not capable of receiving that kind of Infection; and mo&s;t certainly every one's Body is not at all Times in a Di&s;po&s;ition for admitting in a Pe&s;tilential Contagion; and as Nature hath order'd that &s;uch Fevers as begin with great Violence, by the &s;ame Rule, &s;hall the &s;ooner come to a Cri&s;is.</P>
<P>A Pe&s;tilential Fever is attended with various Symptoms from the Beginning, through the whole Cour&s;e; but com|monly at its fir&s;t coming, it &s;eizes with great violence the Head, Stomach, and Lungs; the Blood &s;oon takes the Flame in this Fever, and the Heat being then in the greate&s;t Degree, Nature begins to &s;trive to force out the Enemy, either by Carbuncles, Biles, Eruptions in the Skin, or Exce&s;&s;ive Sweats, and &s;ometimes a vio|lent
<PB N="20" REF="19">Loo&s;ene&s;s, which is the wor&s;t of all the foregoing Symptoms, and I can &s;carce believe that Nature brings on a Loo&s;ene&s;s of her own Accord; I rather think it is caus'd by forcing the Sick to take &s;ome Medicines, or per&s;wading him to eat &s;ome Victuals his weak Stomach cannot bear. The Patient finds Relief from all the other Symptoms, for as the Blood receives the Fever, the Animal Spirits are in &s;ome Mea&s;ure reliev'd; therefore the Phy&s;ician mu&s;t always endeavour to promote the foregoing Symptoms: Since it is certain, unle&s;s &s;ome of 'em concur, the Patient mu&s;t die in a few Hours, by the Animal Spirits being over&s;et with the Violence of the Fever.</P>
<P>There commonly is a continual Keck|ing in drawing in the Breath, which is a &s;trong Proof that raw and unwhole&s;ome Air, has made an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Lungs. By this Di&s;order, in drawing in the Breath, the Stomach becomes very weak and unfit to receive many Medi|cines; therefore as Alexipharmacks are
<PB N="21" REF="20">mo&s;t proper, we mu&s;t be very careful not to give &s;uch as are too loading.</P>
<P>Pe&s;tilential Fevers require a great quan|tity of diluting Liquors, for which rea|&s;on we mu&s;t endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, to relieve the Di&s;order in the Stomach and Lungs, that he may be able to drink as much as is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters are of great Service in Pe&s;ti|lential Fevers, for relieving both the Head and Lungs; and to correct the Stomach, let the Patient take the following Draught every four Hours.&mdash;Take Salt of Worm|wood, a Scruple; Juice of Lemons, half an Ounce; mix'd together in a large Cup, and &s;tir it till it has done fermenting; then put to it an Ounce of Barley Cinnamon Water. As this Draught mu&s;t be repeated, it will be convenient to mix up &s;ix times the Quantity at once, and divide it.</P>
<P>If the Fever, or the Heat in the Blood, &s;hould be very violent, it will be nece&s;&s;a|ry to keep the Body open by Gly&s;ters, or gentle Lenitives, &s;uch as Manna, or a Decoction made of Tamerinds and Senna, of each two Drams, and Salt of Worm|wood,
<PB N="22" REF="21">ten Grains, boil'd in two Ounces of Water; as &s;oon as it boils, take if from the Fire, and &s;train it off, before it is quite cold. This is an excellent Cathar|tick, yet, if mi&s;apply'd, it is liable to do Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>I have been told of Bleeding to the Quantity of an hundred Ounces at once, but they mu&s;t know very little of Anato|my that believe it; yet I confe&s;s, in my Opinion, when we bleed in Pe&s;tilential Fevers we ought to take a large Quan|tity, in order to a&s;&s;wage the Heat, or Vi|olence of the Fever: for by taking the common Quantity, which is about ten Ounces, we only depre&s;s the natural Cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper, and prolong the Grie|vances the Patient lyes under.</P>
<P>The Te&s;taceous Powders are hurtful in this Fever, by rea&s;on that the Stomach abounds with Phlegm, and Oily Medi|cines are improper for no other rea&s;on, than the Stomach being weak, and can|not bear 'em.</P>
<P>Thus the Symptoms of every Di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t always indicate what Remedies, and
<PB N="23" REF="22">when they ought to be applied; only let this be a &s;tanding Rule, what Medicines &s;oever are fit to be given in Pe&s;tilential Fevers, ought to be made up in little Quantities, and repeated often.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to find out better Rules, but &s;o critical and various are the Symp|toms in Fevers, that he may be deem'd an exceeding good Practitioner that does no hurt in them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Inflammatory Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS under this Denomination, affect the Body by a Flux of inflam'd Blood, falling on particular Parts, caus'd frequently by drinking cold Liquors, or &s;ome &s;udden Coldne&s;s in the Air, at a time when the Body is overheated; &s;o this In|flammatory Fever comes in either a Pleu|ri&s;y, a Quinzy, or a <HI>St. Anthony's</HI> Fire.</P>

<P>In the&s;e kind of Fevers it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the Body open, by cooling Gly|&s;ters, and diluting Purgatives; for Relief is given by all moderate Evacuations, bleeding in particular: Sweating is of great &s;ervice, only Sudorificks are &s;o very apt to inflame the Blood; but our Method of Practice is &s;o common in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, that I need not mention bleeding, bli&s;tering, and other Applications. My De&s;ign is on|ly to &s;et down &s;uch things as have not been explain'd hitherto, and &s;uch things as may be u&s;eful hereafter, for which rea&s;on I will &s;et down a Fomentation for the Part affected in a <HI>St. Anthony's</HI> Fire, which I have experienc'd, and know to be valuable.</P>
<P>Take a Pint of Lime-Water, make it boiling hot, put to it a Pint of rectify'd Spirit of Wine, it will be of a right Heat, and mu&s;t be appli'd thus; wrap a Lin|nen Cloth (not Woollen) round, or upon the Inflammation, &s;o that the Cloth may be four or five in thickne&s;s, then pour this
<PB N="25" REF="24">Mixture through the Cloth: upon the in|flam'd Part; this repeated three times a Day, without taking off the Cloth, is much preferable to camphorated Spirit of Wine, Poultices, or any kind of Hot Fomentation; yet we mu&s;t u&s;e inward Means, at the &s;ame Time, to cool the Bo|dy, and temper the Fermentation in the Blood.</P>
<P>But it happens &s;ometimes, that the&s;e Fevers are attended with all the ill Symp|toms of a Malignant Fever, which is very fatal to the Patient, and renders the Cure more difficult to the Phy&s;ician; for al|though the Blood being &s;izy, indicates both bleeding, bli&s;tering, and other Eva|cautions, yet the Rigour upon the Ani|mal Spirits, contradicts that way of Pro|ceeding, becau&s;e both bleeding and bli&s;ter|ing depre&s;s Nature, and irritate the Ani|mal Spirits, and is apt to bring on greater Rigour and Dread. Therefore in a Ma|lignant Pleuri&s;y, I will recommend an In|fu&s;ion of Stone-Hor&s;e Dung, made thus: Take &s;ix Globules of the Hor&s;e Dung, and pour upon it a Quart of the Pectoral De|coction,
<PB N="26" REF="25">boiling Hot; let it &s;tand to in|fu&s;e in an Earthen Ve&s;&s;el, clo&s;e cover'd, about an Hour, then &s;train it off: This In|fu&s;ion both temperates and comforts the Animal Spirits, and commonly keeps the Patient in a gentle Sweat; for gentle Sweats tend to a Recovery, but by ex|ce&s;&s;ive Sweats, Nature is over&s;et, and the Phy&s;ician often deceiv'd by the Patient dying at a time, when he thought him pa&s;t all Danger. The foregoing Infu&s;ion is to be drank frequently, very Hot, about a Quarter of a Pint at a time.</P>
<P>Let the Patient take about thirty Drops of the Elixir of Vipers, in a Cup of the afore&s;aid Infu&s;ion, twice a Day; it is pro|per to keep his Body open by Gly&s;ters, but not to purge upon any Account, un|til all the Symptoms of Malignity are va|ni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>If the Patient's Stomach will bear to take a Bolus, make him up two Scruples of <HI>Edenborough</HI> Treacle, and &s;ix Grains of Salt of Amber; this mu&s;t be given eve|ry &s;ix Hours, with a Draught of the afore|&s;aid Infu&s;ion, or any other diluting Li|quor
<PB N="27" REF="26">quor after it, for we mu&s;t not confine him to the Infu&s;ion of Hor&s;e Dung, though it is wonderful in this Ca&s;e; we mu&s;t di|vert him with a Change, when he's tir'd of any one &s;ort of Liquor.</P>
<P>As I have mentioned the Elixir of Vi|pers, I will &s;et it down before I go any farther, that I may not be accus'd of Quackery, or de&s;igning this Book an Ad|verti&s;ement for my own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Take the Skins of Vipers, dry'd and powder'd, Millepedes dry'd, Contrayer|va Roots in Powder, of each an Ounce, mix the&s;e Ingredients into a Pa&s;t in a Gla&s;s Mortar, with two Ounces of Spirit of Salt, tye the Mortar clo&s;e over with a Bladder, let it &s;tand for five or &s;ix Days, then put it into a Florence Flask, with four Ounces of Spirit of <HI>Nitre Dulcis,</HI> let it &s;tand to dige&s;t in the Sun, or a gen|tle Sand Heat, ten or twelve Days, then pre&s;s it out, and filter it, it mu&s;t be kept in a Bottle with a Gla&s;s Stopper, for it will corrode, and eat a common Cork. This Medicine opens all Ob&s;tructions in the Body, and wonderfully revives, and
<PB N="28" REF="27">cheri&s;hes the Mind, or Animal Spirits; al&s;o cau&s;es Per&s;piration, and quickens Vital Motion.</P>
<P>Yet every Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick, knows not when, and how to apply a good Me|dicine, no more than every Man in Jack Boots, is fit to mount the manag'd Hor&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Of Intermittent Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Fevers vary both according to the Difference in Con&s;titutions, and Degrees of Malignity, therefore liable to be a Quotidian, a Tertian, or a Quar|tan: The mo&s;t favourable &s;ort is, when it comes every Day; the next in Degree, is when it intermits one Day; and the wor&s;t &s;ort of all, is when the Patient is well two Days together, and the third Day has his Fever.</P>
<P>There is yet another Sort, which is commonly call'd a double Tertian: In this the Patient is ill two Days together, and well the third; this is thought the wor&s;t Species of all Intermittents; but who&s;oe|ver
<PB N="29" REF="28">examins &s;trictly, will find it only a Quartan Ague, wherein Nature is by &s;ome Means ob&s;tructed, &s;o that &s;he cannot ex|pel the Malignity by Sweats the fir&s;t Day; &s;o the Fever remains two Days together. I have ob&s;erv'd the Patient to &s;weat the fir&s;t Day, but not a Di&s;charge &s;ufficient for a Quartan Ague, which is not a jot inferiour to either a Malignant, or a Pe&s;ti|lential Fever, for the Time it holds him in the &s;hivering Fit; be&s;ides I have ob&s;erv'd the Sweats have not &s;melt &s;our and fetid, until the &s;econd Day; therefore it ought to be call'd an irregular, or a depre&s;s'd Quartan.</P>
<P>It may be thought miraculous, that In|termittent Fevers &s;hould go off, and re|turn &s;o regularly at &s;tated Periods, when one might rea&s;onably have &s;uppos'd the Patient to have been quite freed from the Di&s;temper by the Sweats, at the Termina|tion of the la&s;t Fit.</P>
<P>Now I am of opinion, that the Body draws in the infectious Particles, from the &s;ourne&s;s of the Sweats, back again; as &s;oon as Nature has thru&s;t out &s;uch Sweats;
<PB N="30" REF="29">&s;o as I judge it in this Fever, the Body is capable of admitting in &s;uch Infection, as Nature at that time di&s;charges through the Pores; &s;o it returns again in as many Hours as it requires to reach the Animal Spirits, to cau&s;e a fre&s;h Di&s;turbance; and then the Nerves again &s;how the Rigour and Antipathy, by &s;haking every Fibre and Mu&s;cle in the Body.</P>
<P>But let this be how it will, Intermit|tent Fevers are &s;o familiar to us, that the Cure is become very ea&s;y; the only Diffi|culty is, when the Bark purges, which is commonly prevented by Opiates; yet the Stomach is manag'd much better with Preparations of Sulphur; for Opiates by thickening the Blood, and cau&s;ing a &s;low|ne&s;s of the Internal Motion, bring on very often the Rheumati&s;m, a Drop&s;y, or &s;ome other Evil much harder to be cur'd, than the Intermittent Fever.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Small-Pox.</HEAD>
<P>WHenever the Small-Pox breaks out in any Part, it commonly takes a run through the whole Place, whether Town or City, and frequently &s;everal Vil|lages near each other, for twelve Miles round.</P>
<P>The Confluent Sort is not a Degree milder than a Pe&s;tilential Fever, and is full as contagious among cho&s;e who have not had the Small-Pox before; neither is the Infection limited to the Small-Pox only; for frequently when the Fever comes to a Cri&s;is, and the Pu&s;tules begin to di|ge&s;t, the purulent Matter then diffu&s;es out an offen&s;ive Smell, which will even infect tho&s;e who have had the Small-Pox before; but as their Bodies are not liable to the Small-Pox, the Infection will be|get a Fever full as bad, if not wor&s;e; and notwith&s;tanding one's Body being incapa|ble of admitting the very &s;ame &s;ort of Fever, yet the Infection may produce a Fever of &s;ome other kind; &s;o great is the
<PB N="32" REF="31">Affinity in Malignant and Pe&s;tilential Fe|vers one towards another.</P>
<P>I can give one In&s;tance of my&s;elf in particular, by lying in the &s;ame Bed with a Man who had a Quartan Ague; his Sweats were very &s;our and fetid, to which Smell I bore &s;o great an Antipathy, that it in|fected me, and had, as I thought, receiv'd an Intermittent Fever, until the Small-Pox came out to convince me to the con|trary. I remember a Child in the &s;ame Hou&s;e had the Small-Pox, about ten Days after me; and this Di&s;temper went no farther; &s;o that it is plain the Con&s;tituti|on of the Air was not fit at that time for an Infection of the Small-Pox, no more than my Body was in a Con&s;titution to receive in an Intermittent Fever.</P>
<P>As I have compar'd the Small-Pox to Pe&s;tilential Fevers, we &s;hould regard eve|ry Symptom in the &s;ame manner; for both bleeding and bli&s;tering ought to be us'd, when Nature is in danger of being over&s;et, by the violent kecking in drawing the Breath; or likewi&s;e the Pain in the Head, and Neck, or other Symptoms be|ing
<PB N="33" REF="32">too violent for Nature to find out her true Cour&s;e for Freedom.</P>
<P>We ought never to force any thing upon the Patient that he has any di&s;like to, tho 'tis too common for the Nur&s;e to urge the Patient to drink beyond his Thir&s;t, either Tare Drink, or &s;ome particular Liquor which &s;he has an opinion of; which fre|quently brings on a vomiting, and a Loo&s;e|ne&s;s, not by its Quality, but by the Quantity he drinks: For although a Liquid be a&s;trin|gent, if the Sick drink more than Nature can bear, it mu&s;t purge it &s;elf off.</P>
<P>The Patient (as I &s;aid before in Pe&s;ti|lential Fevers) mu&s;t be diverted with &s;uch diluting Liquors, as be&s;t &s;uits his De&s;ire, in order to cheri&s;h Nature, that &s;he may be able to do her Part; yet we have Me|thods of relieving &s;everal bad Symptoms in the Small-Pox; but to &s;et down what to apply when &s;uch a Symptom appears, and &s;uch a Medicine in &s;uch a kind of Di&s;order, a Man might write all his Life time, and his Work would be imperfect at la&s;t, and &s;erve only to delude, rather than in&s;truct; therefore an Eye of Judg|ment
<PB N="34" REF="33">looking on the Patient in this and all other Di&s;ea&s;es, will conduct Medicines more effectual, than any Rule &s;et forth by the greate&s;t Author in the World.</P>
<P>Before I conclude upon this Subject, I ought to con&s;ider how it comes to pa&s;s that the Small-Pox are favourable to young Children, when their Bodies are more li|able to receive any kind of Hurt or In|fection from the Air by that Tenderne&s;s in them; yet we mu&s;t allow that they are not &s;o much &s;ubject to either Sympa|thy or Antipathy, neither have they any Dread or Apprehen&s;ion of Death, until the Nur&s;es begin to infect their tender Thoughts with Tales of frightful Gho&s;ts; &s;o that the Small-Pox is more favourable, if the Thoughts keep free from Malig|nity and Dread; this is the be&s;t Rea&s;on I can give at pre&s;ent, but if Time and Practice introduce me hereafter to a better Knowledge in this, or any other Di&s;tem|per, I &s;hall be glad to publi&s;h it, &s;ince my De&s;ire is to improve the Art of heal|ing, as far as Providence has given me a Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>Of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mea&s;les proceed from a Raw|ne&s;s or Heavine&s;s in the Air, which clogs the Pores of the Body, and hinders Per&s;piration, and is more apt to afflict Children and young People, by rea&s;on of a greater Tenderne&s;s in them, than in Per|&s;ons that are in Years, who&s;e Bodies are harden'd to all Alterations.</P>
<P>The Mea&s;les certainly is a Fever, al|though it does not &s;o readily &s;hew it&s;elf by the Tokens common in other Fevers; yet if we examine &s;trictly, we find it very nervous and violent by two Symptoms in particular; the fir&s;t and mo&s;t plain, is the Pain in the Optick Nerves, which pro|duces a Di&s;charge of &s;harp Humour out of the Eyes; and when it happens that the Patient hath not this Di&s;charge, the Pain in the Head and behind the Eyes is more violent.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A Pain and Sorene&s;s in the Kidneys, with an Inflammation in all the Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages, whereby the Water is
<PB N="36" REF="35">in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uppre&s;s'd, and ting'd of a reddi&s;h Colour; and as one Evil begets another, &s;o this Grief in the Kidneys and Urinary Ve&s;&s;els, cau&s;es that violent Sick|ne&s;s which always en&s;ues and commonly la&s;ts about eight or ten Hours before it begins to abate then the Ra&s;h comes out; and for want of a free cour&s;e of Urine, there commonly comes on a Loo&s;ene&s;s at the &s;ame time, &s;o the Patient begins to find &s;ome Ea&s;e by intervals. Now the Symp|toms go off by Degrees; only the Cough which began at fir&s;t, continues, and may prove of ill Con&s;equence, if not remov'd in time by proper means; &s;uch as Emul|&s;ions made with <HI>Sperma Ceti,</HI> to be drank frequently, and a Mucilage made of Quince Seeds, with &s;ome Nutmeg grated into it, and a little Sugar to make it agreeable, to be taken by a &s;poonful at a time, as often as the Cough is trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Let him take a Paper of Powder made of prepar'd Coral and <HI>Lac Sulphur,</HI> of each fifteen Grains, twice a Day in a quarter of a Pint of new Milk; the&s;e Medicines will an&s;wer the End if continued for ten
<PB N="37" REF="36">or fifteen Days, being made and apply'd as they ought, I mean by having a due regard to the Con&s;titution of the Patient and the Symptoms of the Di&s;orders; he may eat at the &s;ame time Broths, and any nouri&s;hing Meats in Moderation, &s;uch as his Fancy prompts him to; he may drink for his common Drink, Barley Water, and &s;ometimes a Draught of Small Beer, if it is not too &s;tale; for the Pectoral Decocti|ons are of no &s;ervice in this Cough, nei|ther are the common Linctus's, made of Oils and Pectoral Syrups.</P>
<P>All heating Medicines are hurtful, from the beginning quite thro' the whole Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e; and the vain pretence of &s;triking the Di&s;temper out from the Heart, is without any Grounds of Rea&s;on or Con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Patient mu&s;t forbear all Spirituous Liquors, and Cordial Medicines, unle&s;s we find the Spirits very much reduc'd by Sweats and other Evacuations; and even then we &s;hould be very careful how we attempt to elevate, &s;ince mo&s;t Medicines under the Denomination of Cordials, are
<PB N="38" REF="37">liable to encourage the Fever to run beyond its natural Mea&s;ure; and it is by this means that a Hectick Fever, and a Con&s;umptive Cough, &s;o often follows the Mea&s;les and Fever of this Kind.</P>
<P>A Scarlet Fever is of the very &s;ame Na|ture, and mu&s;t be treated in the &s;ame man|ner.</P>
<P>As the Ra&s;h and Mea&s;les are &s;o apt to affect the Lungs, I will &s;et forth the na|ture of a Hectick Fever, Coughs, and Con|&s;umptions in the following Chapter; keep|ing clo&s;e to Truth, which is the principal Virtue, and ought to be the Care of every Author in Phy&s;ick.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Con&s;umptions.</HEAD>
<P>COn&s;umptions which befal Young People, are always introduc'd by a Hectick Fever, wherein the Blood is too thin and &s;pirituous, and partly of a Scor|butick Quality.</P>
<P>If we duly con&s;ider that the Lungs are &s;upply'd with Moi&s;ture no other way than
<PB N="39" REF="38">by what per&s;pires out of the Diaphragma, and Pleura; it is not &s;o wonderful that a &s;harpne&s;s in the Blood &s;hould afflict the Lungs with that continual hecking and tickling Cough: &s;ince it is plain that the Moi&s;ture within the Thorax mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of the Serum, and the mo&s;t thin Particles from the Blood; for both the Diaphrag|ma and Pleura abound with Minute San|guiferous Ve&s;&s;els; and as a Con&s;umptive Cough is introduc'd by this Heat, or &s;harp|ne&s;s in the Blood, &s;o this Hectick Fever is caus'd by Victuals of too high Nouri&s;h|ment, and Liquors too Rich and Strong for Per&s;ons who&s;e Blood is apt to be too &s;pirituous, being in their Youth and Vigour.</P>
<P>Some People, for want of a true Idea, will be apt to di&s;pute this being the only Cau&s;e of a Hectick Fever; yet I am cer|tain it is; though it &s;o often comes at the Conclu&s;ion of other Fevers; it is not na|tural to &s;ucceed any of 'em; but caus'd by the ill Mea&s;ures afore&s;aid; neither is it difficult to cure, if the Patient can be regulated into a proper Regimen, &s;uch as Panada, Mutton-Broth, made without
<PB N="40" REF="39">Turnips; Rice in any form, Jelleys, Flu|mery, Raw Milk, warm from the Cow, and all Things that are cooling and heal|ing.</P>
<P>He mu&s;ts ab&s;tain from Salt Meats, Rich Soops, and all Victuals of high Nouri&s;h|ment; neither mu&s;t he drink Wines, Spi|rituous Drams, nor any kind of Cordials.</P>
<P>When the Patient will &s;et a Re&s;oluti|on to diet him&s;elf in the foregoing Man|ner, we may promi&s;e a Cure by the fol|lowing Method.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t take away nine or ten Ounces of Blood; then let the Patient drink plen|tifully of Emul&s;ions made of the Cold Seeds, with ten Drops of the Balm of <HI>Gilead</HI> to every Quart; and let him take as often as the Cough troubles him, a &s;poonful of a Mucilage made of Quince Kernels, with &s;ome Nutmeg grated into it, and a little Sugar to make it agreeable, and no more, (for Sugar is apt to cau&s;e too quick a Fermentation in the Stomach.) Pearl Juleps are of &s;ingular u&s;e, being cooling and grateful; he may drink com|mon Whey &s;ometimes for a Change, it is
<PB N="41" REF="40">very proper, having in it an Emollient Quality; he may take a gentle Decocti|on of Senna, and Rhubarb, to open his Body as often as there is occa&s;ion; for it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep him rather Laxative, than Co&s;tive.</P>
<P>The Patient mu&s;t u&s;e no violent Exer|ci&s;e, nor give a Loo&s;e to Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind; for all ra&s;h Motions or Thoughts of Revenge, and all &s;udden Surprizes, or Thoughts of Plea&s;ure, will cau&s;e remi&s;&s;ive Blu&s;hes in the Countenance, and &s;udden &s;harp Sweats, which remit and return, as often as tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions affect him.</P>
<P>This is the true Nature of this kind of Con&s;umption, which is (by the Vulgar) commonly called the galloping Con&s;ump|tion; and indeed a very proper Name, if we con&s;ider that in this Di&s;temper, Na|ture is too much elevated, and running her Cour&s;e unrein'd, falls flat before &s;he makes out half her Length.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="42" REF="41">
<HEAD>Of the Phthi&s;ic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW it is to be noted, that Old People's Blood may be made too rich; yet not &s;o apt to be &s;pirituous and &s;harp, but rather heavy and clammy, there|fore it produces in them the Phthi&s;ic, A&s;th|ma, or &s;ome &s;uch kind of Di&s;order; where|in the Lungs are overloaded with a tough Mucus, or Flegm.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e all &s;pirituous Liquors (drank in Moderation) are proper, and every thing that may quicken the Fermentation in the Stomach; for this is a &s;lackne&s;s of Motion, as the former is a quickne&s;s; therefore riding, and all Brisk Exerci&s;es of the Body, are proper in this Ca&s;e, as they are hurtful in the former; and as the other is from the Force of Eagerne&s;s and Ra&s;hne&s;s in Youth, this the Effect of Heavine&s;s in Old Age; and although this &s;ort of Con&s;umption is not of &s;o &s;harp a Nature, yet it is much harder to cure; notwith&s;tanding the Patient may be very much reliev'd by expectorating Medicines;
<PB N="43" REF="42">even when he ga&s;ps for Breath, the Tubes in the Lungs being clog'd and contracted by the vi&s;cid Mucus or Flegm.</P>
<P>The be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Remedies are the&s;e following: A Linctus made of Oximel of Squills, Syrrup of Bal&s;am and Lin&s;eed Oil, of each equal Quantities; let the Patient take a Spoonful every Morn|ing; but when it happens that his Sto|mach will not bear this Linctus, make up in&s;tead of it, a Mixture of Gum Am|moniacum, two Drams, di&s;&s;olv'd in &s;ix Ounces of Penny-Royal-Water; he mu&s;t take three Spoonfuls of this Mixture every Morning; if it &s;hould purge him too much, let him take le&s;s in Quantity.</P>
<P>An Ounce of Tincture of <HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> with thirty Drops of Liquid <HI>Laudanum,</HI> to be taken every fourth Night going to Bed; Malt Drink is hurtful, becau&s;e it is heavy and clogging, therefore I advi&s;e him to Punch made with Oranges, to drink moderately as his Spirits require it.</P>
<P>By this Means the Patient may be made &s;o ea&s;y, or at lea&s;t reliev'd &s;o far, as he &s;hall find very little inconveniency in it,
<PB N="44" REF="43">yet he may be afflicted with this Sort of Con&s;umption (I mean the Phthi&s;ic and A&s;thma) above twenty Years; and even at la&s;t his Death may be imputed to Old Age.</P>
<P>In this Place it may be ob&s;erv'd, that what Man &s;oever would prolong his Cour&s;e with Nature, this mu&s;t be his Rule, depre&s;s her gently, as there is Occa&s;ion, in his youthful Years, and cheri&s;h her as he grows Old.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could &s;et forth the Ideas I have of Con&s;umptions in a fairer Light; yet it may be under&s;tood from what I have &s;aid, that every whee&s;ing Cough is not a Con&s;umption, nor every hecking or tickling Cough the Phthi&s;ic.</P>
<P>Thus the Virtue of a Phy&s;ician con|&s;i&s;ts in judging exactly the Nature of the Di&s;temper, and the Con&s;titution of the Patient; and this was the Advantage that Doctor <HI>Radcliff</HI> had, in knowing his Maker, (I mean he judg'd Nature) better than other Men: So &s;prang his unpara|lel'd Succe&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Drop&s;y.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Phy&s;ical Writers have erro|neou&s;ly drawn other Di&s;tempers to this Title, making three or four different Sorts of Drop&s;ies.</P>
<P>I beg their Pardon for &s;aying that no Di&s;temper is a Drop&s;y, but an Over&s;et of Water that pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Valves, and contracts the Pa&s;&s;ages which (by Nature) are de&s;ign'd to receive or &s;uck up that Water which is in the Abdomen, in or|der to di&s;charge it out of the Body.</P>
<P>A Tympany cannot be call'd a Drop&s;y, becau&s;e it is Wind pent up without Mo|tion,, &s;o it is call'd <HI>Tympanum,</HI> or a Drum.</P>
<P>And what is call'd a Drop&s;y in the <HI>O|varia,</HI> is a Hurt by Coition, when the Textures or Animalculas of the Seed are broken or imperfect, which being receiv'd, embrac'd, and retain'd in the <HI>Orchis,</HI> draws to it the <HI>Mucus</HI> or nouri&s;hment, which attends and flows to the Parts of Gene|ration in a natural and vital Conception.
<PB N="46" REF="45">Now this Mucilaginous Matter concoct|ed by vital Warmth, becomes hard and tough; it increa&s;es in bigne&s;s, and grows every Day more hard to cure.</P>
<P>When we meet with any one under this Misfortune, we mu&s;t depre&s;s Nature by Rough Medicines, which are cold and revul&s;ive, in order to give a &s;udden Shock to the Parts of Generation; for all warm|ing Medicines are hurtful in this Di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e the Warmth of Nature glutinates all &s;limy Matter to a Toughne&s;s, as a Coldne&s;s of Nature reduces it to a Soft|ne&s;s or a Fluidity.</P>
<P>Thus a Fal&s;e Conception re&s;embles a Natural one; yet although this Re&s;em|blance between a Drop&s;y, a Tympany, and a Conception, may deceive the Eye, it ought not to deceive the Under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>Therefore a real Drop&s;y is, when the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> and all the Urinary Ve&s;&s;els are &s;tun'd and ob&s;tructed, which the Patient feels by a Heavine&s;s and Numbne&s;s in the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and all the lower Part of the Body; the Bowels are relax'd, and the
<PB N="47" REF="46">Peri&s;taltick Motion very &s;low; by this Slowne&s;s of the Internal Motion, and Weakne&s;s in the Bowels and Urinary Ve&s;|&s;els; the Water in the Cavity of the Belly has no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> its Motion nor Freedom, to pa&s;s out of the Body; &s;o it cau&s;es fir&s;t the Belly to &s;well, and the Legs &s;oon after, by the Weight of this watery Humour pre&s;&s;ing downwards. And the &s;hortne&s;s of Breath which always attends this Di&s;temper, is caus'd by the Cavity of the Belly being &s;o fill'd with Water, that it pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the the Diaphragma or Midriff; thus it con|tracts or &s;traitens the Che&s;t or Thorax, which contains the Heart and Lights, &s;o that this Pre&s;&s;ure that the Water makes again&s;t the Midriff, hinders the Che&s;t from expanding, and the Lungs from dilating &s;ufficiently for Re&s;piration.</P>
<P>I may (with a good A&s;&s;urance) object again&s;t the common Proceedings in this Di&s;ea&s;e; &s;ince both Rea&s;on and Practice will defend me.</P>
<P>The Common Method is rough Ca|tharticks and Emeticks; &s;uch as Turbiths Mineral, Panacea of Antimony, Gambo-Elebor,
<PB N="48" REF="47">Elaterium, and &s;uch like Me|dicines, which by Repetition, relax and tear tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els that are already weaken'd with the Di&s;ea&s;e: Thus the Pa|tient is reduc'd into &s;uch a wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Condi|tion, that it will be pa&s;t the Art of Man to re&s;tore him; notwith&s;tanding he is flatter'd at fir&s;t, and thinks him&s;elf &s;ome|thing better, when his Stomach and Bow|els are emptied by the afore&s;aid Evacua|tions: Thus the Phy&s;ician and the Patient are both deceiv'd, for want of knowing that every rough Purge and &s;training Vo|mit weakens the Peri&s;taltick Motion, and benumbs the <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> and all the Uri|nary Ve&s;&s;els that are de&s;ign'd to &s;uck up the Water, when there is more in the Belly, than the nece&s;&s;ary Quantity.</P>
<P>Now it is worth the Phy&s;ician's While to con&s;ider that the Bowels &s;wim in this Water; the Water is not in the Bowels, therefore if we aim at a perfect Cure, we mu&s;t u&s;e Diureticks, and re&s;torative Medicines; for as &s;oon as the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> and Urinary Ve&s;&s;els recover their Strength, and the Bowels the Warmth and natural Mo|tion,
<PB N="49" REF="48">the u&s;ual Pa&s;&s;ages will then be ca|pable of receiving the Water, and di&s;|charging it out, both by Urine and Stool.</P>
<P>I do not want to conceal any thing, that might be depended upon, to render my Works more u&s;eful for the Health and Pre&s;ervation of Mankind; although there are &s;ome particular Medicines which I have found &s;ucce&s;&s;ful, and know to be infallible, if duly admini&s;tred, and the Patient at the &s;ame time rightly ma|naged; but &s;o various are the Con&s;titu|tions of Human Bodies, and &s;o particu|lar are their Tempers, that if a Medi|cine does not &s;uit with their Ways of thinking, they can hardly be per&s;uaded to take it; and even then they will not repeat it, becau&s;e it does not take away the Swelling all of a &s;udden, as a Wo|man, at her full Time with Child, is de|liver'd of her Big-belly by a Midwife.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Stone and Gravel.</HEAD>
<P>MOST Jellys, or mucilaginous Matter, fix'd, or lying in any part of the Body without motion, by vital Heat becomes hard or tough; and, in time, turns to Bone or Stone.</P>
<P>So the Stone (being bred of Slime, which fixes it&s;elf in the Urinary Ve&s;&s;els) is more &s;ubject to Children, than grown Per&s;ons; who&s;e Bodies are by Nature &s;tronger, and more liable to ca&s;t off by Evacuation, that &s;ort of &s;limy Matter, which petrifies by lying in the urinary Ve&s;&s;els without motion.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Gravel is more apt to af|flict grown People; for, as Time turns mo&s;t hard things to du&s;t; &s;o the Stone, as it grows ripe, begins to canker and crumble to Sand and Gravel, which cau&s;es Pain as it pa&s;&s;es out through the Ure|thra; therefore it is a great Mi&s;take, to think that the Gravel breeds the Stone; for it is the Stone that produces the Gra|vel.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="50">
<P>We mu&s;t be very cautious in giving Diureticks; for by their forcing Quality the Patient is very much tormented.</P>
<P>A Decoction of Mallows, Emul&s;ions, and all oily Medicines, are nece&s;&s;ary, by mollifying and healing the Fibres in the urinary Pa&s;&s;ages: But no Medicine can be more effectual, when the Pain is vio|lent, than a Turpentine Gly&s;ter; which gives Ea&s;e by its unctuous and healing Quality. Thus, as often as the &s;harpne&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e returns, the Patient may be made tolerable ea&s;y; until Time crum|ble the Stone into Particles, &s;mall enough to come away without much Pain.</P>
<P>It ought to be con&s;ider'd, that People in Years are apt to have Inflammations, and Sorene&s;&s;es in the Bladder and <HI>Pelvis,</HI> which are frequently mi&s;taken for the Stone.</P>
<P>Manna taken once in ten Days, is an exceeding good Medicine for any Sore|ne&s;s or Ulcer in the Bladder or Kidneys; and is al&s;o very proper, even in the Stone and Gravel, by preventing any Inflamma|tion in the Kidneys: For Manna being
<PB N="52" REF="51">opening and cooling, gently carries off all corro&s;ive Humours from tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>As I was objecting again&s;t forcing Re|medies, I will further &s;ay, that when we attempt to force Nature, we commonly ob&s;truct her, as is demon&s;trable to any skilful. Practitioner: yet with Care the Stone may, in a great mea&s;ure, be caus'd to crumble to Pieces.</P>
<P>I once thought my&s;elf Ma&s;ter of this Knack of di&s;&s;olving the Stone (as I call'd it) having had &s;urpri&s;ing Succe&s;s in three different Children, who were about five or &s;ix Years old; which puff'd me up with Vanity; until I was call'd to a Child of Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI>'s, a Carpenter, in <HI>Swan Yard,</HI> in the <HI>Strand:</HI> I was then very young and giddy headed; a&s;&s;ur'd 'em I could di&s;&s;olve the Stone, and bring it away. Here I was di&s;appointed; the Child's Pain increa&s;ed &s;o much, that they &s;ent to an|other, who had recour&s;e to his Knife; and I was laugh'd at, and de&s;pis'd; and perhaps it was better it happen'd &s;o: For had I &s;ucceeded here, I &s;hould have been more ob&s;tinate in my Practice, be|yond
<PB N="53" REF="52">Rea&s;on: Since this, I never would attempt to break the Stone in the Blad|der. Though, I confefs, if I had a Child of my own afflicted with it, I would u&s;e all Means, before he &s;hould receive that Hurt by Lithotomy, which they &s;carce ever perfectly recover.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Pox.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e has certainly been for Time out of mind, although it has &s;hown it&s;elf of late Years in &s;harper Symptoms, by rea&s;on of eating great quan|tities of Sugar, and foreign Sweets, which create a corro&s;ive Quality in the Fluids; and I really believe it was this Di&s;tem|per, that in old Times was call'd the Plague of a Lepro&s;y, and the hoary Ul|cer; and was thought to be occa&s;ioned by the Men cohabiting with their Wo|men in the time of Natural Purgations; and to prevent the&s;e kind of Di&s;orders, or Uncleanne&s;&s;es, the Elders made very
<PB N="54" REF="53">&s;trict Laws to re&s;train the People at &s;uch Times. But if they had re&s;trained every Man to one Woman only, and likewi&s;e every Woman to one Man only, it would then have had the de&s;ir'd Effect; for the Pox was caus'd then, as it may now, by Exce&s;s; (for exce&s;s of any thing is Poi&s;on,) I mean Exce&s;s in Venery; when one Woman admits, or is compell'd to receive the Seeds of &s;everal Men one immediately after another, though they are all &s;ound Men, and the Woman like|wi&s;e &s;ound and well, yet the variety of Seeds thus fermenting within the Ma|trix, will inflame and corrode the Parts of Generation.</P>
<P>I need not &s;et down the nature of a fre&s;h Clap, becau&s;e it is done by &s;o many before; nor the Method of Cure, &s;ince People, for the &s;ake of &s;aving their Mo|ney, will apply to any Apprentice, or Quack, who plies 'em off with rough Medicines, and puts even them&s;elves to &s;ix times the Expence that is nece&s;&s;ary, and the Patient, to &s;ixty times the Incon|veniency. For there are &s;ome Symptoms,
<PB N="55" REF="54">at the fir&s;t beginning, which are very &s;harp and dangerous, and prove of fatal Con&s;equence, if not manag'd with both Care and Judgment.</P>
<P>I have not had a great deal of Prac|tice in Venereal Ca&s;es, yet I have met with &s;ome particular Di&s;orders which may be worth mentioning; &s;uch as &s;tub|born <HI>Gonorrhaeas;</HI> a continual pain, or rather a Tenderne&s;s upon the Bone of the No&s;e; a Flux of &s;harp Humour from the Ears; an Ulcer in the Throat, or <HI>Uvula,</HI> and &s;uch like Di&s;orders: which I have met with in Per&s;ons who&s;e Con&s;ti|tutions have in a manner been worn out, by repeating Mercurial Medicines &s;o often, that at la&s;t they would neither purge nor &s;alivate, by rea&s;on of the Glands being &s;tunn'd, and the <HI>Mucus</HI> and natu|ral Moi&s;ture exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>In &s;uch like Ca&s;es the Cure con&s;i&s;ts in warming re&s;torative Medicines; the Pa|tient, at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t &s;tick to a nouri&s;hing Diet, in order to cheri&s;h and &s;trengthen Nature; for as the Glands re|cover their true Tone, and the Fluids
<PB N="56" REF="55">their vital Spirit, the mercurial Medi|cines, which lie dormant, will then be|gin to work their Effect, either by a con|tinual Purging, or a gentle Salivation. This is what I can affirm from Expe|cience, which is a Proof beyond Rea&s;on it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I would not have the World mi&s;take me, to think that I am exclaiming a|gain&s;t Mercury; for I find it the mo&s;t effectual, and the ea&s;ie&s;t Method of Cure; and indeed the &s;afe&s;t, if it is manag'd rightly. And that Hoar&s;ene&s;s, or Di&s;|order upon the Lungs, which &s;o fre|quently en&s;ues a Salivation, proceeds not from the Mercury, but from &s;ome Mi&s;|management, either in their Diet, or im|proper Medicines given upon Mercury, under pretence of taking off the Sali|vation: For Mercury is &s;eldom mended by other Medicines, it is frequently made wor&s;e. Neither does the Virtue of Diet|drinks con&s;i&s;t in the Quality of the In|gredients, but in the Quantity the Pa|tient drinks. For &s;uppo&s;e there &s;hould remain a corro&s;ive Quality in the Body

<P>But however I am convinc'd that Mer|cury, if hone&s;tly prepar'd, leaves no Poi|&s;on behind it, if the Phy&s;ician will let it work off in its own ea&s;y Manner; yet as the Lungs are refin'd by a Salivation, they become very tender, and liable to be hurt by all Cordial Medicines or Wines, and any Spirituous Liquors: There is not half &s;o much Danger of taking Cold as is &s;up|pos'd; for if I was to &s;alivate a Per&s;on at the Hazard of my own Life, I would keep him no hotter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">han he him&s;elf found agreeable.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Gout.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JUVENIS Voluptate abundans edit potatque; Senectute autem invadente, vigor naturalis evane&s;cet, multis occupatur|que moeroribus.</HI></P>
<P>So the Gout proceeds from Indulgencies
<PB N="58" REF="57">we give our&s;elves up to, when we find a Slackne&s;s of De&s;ire; for then we begin to fear a Decay; and with vain Hopes of prompting our&s;elves to our former Gaiety and Vigour, drink Wines and Spirituous Liquors, without a Natural Thir&s;t or real De&s;ire, and eat Loads of Rich Victuals, without the true Rule of Appetite.</P>
<P>Thus, by overloading the Stomach, the Fibres and Pores or Pa&s;&s;ages, by which the Nouri&s;hment &s;teams or per&s;pires out of the Stomach into the Lacteals, are re|lax'd or dilated; &s;o that the Nouri&s;hment which is drawn into the Lacteals, is too heavy, and of a crude and clammy Qua|lity; which Di&s;temper being communi|cated to the Blood, irregulates the Moti|on of the Artery and the Nerve; for there is a Nerve lies clo&s;e along with every Ar|tery, and at every Pul&s;ation of Blood from the Heart, the&s;e Nerves give a Jirk (for a better Expre&s;&s;ion I may call it a recep|tive or an a&s;&s;i&s;tive Motion) which draws along the Pul&s;ation of Blood by the &s;ame Motion at the &s;ame Moment into every Artery in the Body; for notwith&s;tanding the Motion of the Heart being very forci|ble,
<PB N="59" REF="58">it could not drive the Blood with that Quickne&s;s into the extreme Parts at every Sy&s;tole, if it was not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Nerve in the Manner I have de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>Now the Blood being heavy and clam|my, cannot circulate back again by the Veins quick enough to receive the Blood from the Artery; and when an Artery is thus ob&s;tructed, the Pul&s;ations come by Pu&s;hes, or Thru&s;ts, &s;triving for Freedom, yet the Nerve keeps it's true Motion; and this Irregularity of Time and Motion be|tween the Nerve and the Artery, tears &s;ome of the fine Membranes which brace 'em together.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e Membranes being tore by the afore&s;aid Pu&s;hes, or Thru&s;ts, cau&s;e that violent Pain, and produce a kind of Jel|ly, which by lying in a continual Heat, grows Hard, &s;o that in time it will re|&s;emble Chalk Stones, which I confe&s;s is very &s;urpri&s;ing; yet an Egg Shell is more like Chalk, being form'd of a Natural Matter and a nece&s;&s;ary Heat, as the Gout Stones are form'd of fal&s;e Matter, and Supernatural Heat.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="59">
<P>I am very certain that the Gout may be cur'd where the Patient will regulate his Life, and conquer him&s;elf to a proper Diet.</P>
<P>I might make a long Di&s;cour&s;e on the Particulars, from the Experience I have had, having been afflicted with it my&s;elf before I was two and thirty Years Old: I confe&s;s I am partly a&s;hamed, as I impute the Gout to the afore&s;aid Cau&s;es, yet I may tell it with &s;ome Pride, the Conque&s;t I have made in being entirely free from any Symptom of it now.</P>
<P>But I can hardly believe any one will re&s;train him&s;elf with &s;o much Re&s;oluti|on as I did, therefore I need not &s;et down the Method I took with my&s;elf, only ad|vi&s;e the Patient never to eat above a Quarter of a Pound of Solid Victuals at one Meal, although that Quantity may be eaten every three Hours; neither mu&s;t he drink above a Quarter of a Pint of Liquor at one Draught, yet he may drink as often as De&s;ire prompts him, &s;o that his Liquor be not too &s;trong, nor &s;tale, but rather new and upon the Ferment; for
<PB N="61" REF="60">new working Small Beer, and even parch'd Peas are very proper, likewi&s;e all windy Things what&s;oever that may in any Mea|&s;ure quicken Motion and Circulation; perhaps &s;ome Per&s;ons may object again&s;t windy Things, for fear of the Cholick, yet it is without Rea&s;on; for the Cho|lick cannot be cur'd without things that ferment in the Stomach, and quicken the Peri&s;taltick Motion.</P>
<P>In the Gout it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Pa|tient &s;hould drink plentifully, &s;o his Li|quors are proper; for it is a kind of Fe|ver, as we find when we are awak'd out of our Sleep with the Pain, and a rigorous Di&s;order in the Nerves throughout the whole Body; yet it is not &s;afe to attempt a Cure by the afore&s;aid Method, nor any ways to depre&s;s Nature, until the violence of the Fit goes off; therefore Strong Wines and all warming Bitters are pro|per to defend the Stomach, while the Patient has the Fit upon him; yet a &s;trong Decoction of Camomile Flowers drank hot every Night going to Bed, is prefer|able
<PB N="62" REF="61">to Snake Root, or any other Bitter what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I am not guilty of fancying one parti|cular Medicine Univer&s;al, or fit to be given in all Di&s;tempers; yet I will recom|mend the Elixir of Vipers in the Gout; it may be given even in the violence of the Fit; it &s;ecures the Stomach by cre|ating an inward Briskne&s;s and Thir&s;t; for a Thir&s;t is a very good Symptom in the Gout, as a devouring Appetite is a bad one, before the Fit comes on.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable how the Patient eats with a prodigious Greedine&s;s a Day or two before the Fit begins, but not with a Natural Hunger, nor Plea&s;ure; for when a Man who is very hungry &s;its down calm|ly to a Di&s;h of Soop, or &s;ome &s;uch thing half dige&s;ted, he may feel in three or four Minutes a Sweetne&s;s and Delight flow to each Brea&s;t, as the Nouri&s;hment &s;teams out of the Stomach into the Lacteal Ve&s;&s;els; and when a Per&s;on debars him&s;elf from eating longer than ordinary, Nature then calls in the <HI>Mucus</HI> from all the Glands, and the Moi&s;ture in the Mu&s;cles from
<PB N="63" REF="62" MS="y">all the extreme Parts, to &s;upport the Heart and Spirit that Motion may not cea&s;e; but &s;till this Suction of Nature will reach farther; for if a Man was to be quite debar'd from eating and drinking, his Life might be pre&s;erv'd con&s;iderably long|er by a nouri&s;hing Poultice made of Bread moi&s;ten'd with Wine and Gravy, and ap|ply'd to each Brea&s;t, for the Brea&s;ts are mo&s;t capable of communicating a Nou|ri&s;hment to cheri&s;h and &s;upport the Ani|mal Spirits, becau&s;e there is no Mu&s;cle or fle&s;hy Sub&s;tance outwardly, that has &s;o near a Communication to the Heart and Stomach; <HI>here I make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> Stop.</HI></P>
<P>With &s;ome Doubt and Di&s;courage|ment I am reflecting on my own Works; been telling a Friend, a Man in Practice, that I have &s;pent a few Hours in writing the Natural Cau&s;es and Steps to the Cure of &s;everal Di&s;tempers, who gave me a de&s;pi&s;able Sneer, and told me that a great many Fools are publi&s;h'd of late, and are as much a&s;ham'd of them&s;elves, when they come to &s;ee their Thoughts in Print, as they were in love with their Works whil&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="63">in Manu&s;cripts: Be&s;ides, &s;ays he, can a giddy headed young Fellow of five and thirty be capable of Matters in Phy&s;ick, which ought to be from Thoughts mo&s;t &s;olid and &s;ublime?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the Spirit that leads me is &s;elf-Opinion, and I believe no Man writes without it, and the &s;tronger this Spirit is in any Author, the more valuable are his Works, if there be but the Weight of Rea|&s;on in his Thoughts; and the Thoughts of &s;everal valuable and &s;ublime Things are lo&s;t, for want of being comprehend|ed and encouraged.</P>
<P>Thus I recover my&s;elf again from that Reflection of Youth and Vanity, with an A&s;&s;urance that if a Man be ever capable of doing Wonders, it mu&s;t be while he is in his Prime; before heavy Days come, when his Sen&s;es grow &s;lack and imper|fect; for then his Sight, his Ta&s;te, and Smell deceive him.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Man who&s;e Sight is decay|ing, was to give a De&s;cription of a Can|dle burning about &s;ix Yards from him; how mu&s;t he de&s;cribe it to us? Mu&s;t he
<PB N="65" REF="64">&s;ay there's a Circle round it, or Streams of Light, or &s;ome &s;uch Imperfection which he &s;ees, though he's &s;ure it is not in the Candle, but in his Sen&s;e of Sight; how is he &s;ure? Becau&s;e he remembers the Candle burnt perfect when his Sight was clear. But the Di&s;orders in the Eyes, I &s;hall pre&s;erve among &s;ome practical Ob|&s;ervations and Experiments in Anatomy, which if I had a full Authority, I &s;hould be glad to publi&s;h, with the Cau&s;es of &s;everal other Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es: For my De&s;ign is to &s;et down the real Cau&s;es of Di&s;tempers, and ill Proceedings in &s;eve|ral remarkable Ca&s;es, whereby many bad Symptoms in &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es may be &s;hun'd ea&s;ier than cur'd; yet Wonders may be done in all Di&s;tempers by a skil|ful Phy&s;ician, and a careful Nur&s;e, where the Patient complies with Rules nece&s;&s;a|ry for his Di&s;order.</P>
<P>I cannot believe it the Will of the Al|mighty, that a Man &s;hall be &s;natch'd away before he has run his due Cour&s;e with Nature.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="65">
<P>For certainly, when there is a Concep|tion, it ought to come to a Natural Birth, at a Natural Time; and after a Child is born, (if it is not hurt nor hinder'd) it mu&s;t grow to a Natural Strength, and the Cour&s;e of Life to be of a Natural Length; there|fore Di&s;ea&s;es are always caus'd by &s;ome Hurt or ill Rules of Life.</P>
<P>People cannot die in their Youth, un|le&s;s Nature be depre&s;s'd, or over&s;et; Na|ture may be depre&s;s'd even to Death by Hunger, Coldne&s;s, or Lo&s;s of Blood; and She may be over&s;et by Dread, or Surprize, violent Motion, or exce&s;&s;ive Eating and Drinking: How often do we find Nur&s;es de&s;troy Young Children by Strong Li|quors, or &s;tuffing 'em to &s;uch a Degree, that Nature is over&s;et, and they are &s;eiz'd with Convul&s;ions, and die.</P>
<P>Yet it may be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to curb, or rather depre&s;s Nature; at other times it may be nece&s;&s;ary to cheri&s;h, or rather prompt her; &s;o the Cour&s;e of Life may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure be prolong'd by Management and Care.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="66">
<P>But I am very &s;en&s;ible that Nature will change, and Life mu&s;t come towards a Period; for as De&s;ire abates, we then be|gin to bow down our Faces with Care again&s;t the Earth, to &s;ee that we tread our Steps in Safety; and when the Marks of Age are carried in the Face of Man, he lies down to re&s;t in Grief, &s;lumbering, in his Fancy hears the Bird o' th' Night, &s;tarts up in Fear of that which is on High; While thus he li&s;tens, his Ears, and all the Gates are open, until his Thoughts are over&s;et with Dread, then the Harmony cea&s;es, becau&s;e the Strings of Mu&s;ick are &s;lack; thus, the Gari&s;on is given up to the great Conqueror, and the Soul to God that gave it.</P>
