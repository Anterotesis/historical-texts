<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS &s;mall Treati&s;e was origi|nally intended for a private Paper of In&s;tructions to the <HI>GENTLEMAN,</HI> who&s;e Name it bears, to direct him how to manage him&s;elf under the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is, in|deed, an Ab&s;tract of a larger one, on the &s;ame Subject, which has lain by me the&s;e &s;even Years; which, yet, I have not had Lei&s;ure or Humour to fini&s;h. Several Co|pies of this having got Abroad, and the pi|tiful Conde&s;cendence of Pyrating Book&s;ellers, even to &s;uch Trifles as the&s;e, have con&s;train'd me to let it come out in Print, as it is, to prevent its coming out from them. The
<PB N="ii" REF="3">Gentlemen of the Profe&s;&s;ion may ea&s;ily per|ceive, by the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Philo&s;ophy, and the low Detail of the Pharmacy, it was not de&s;ign'd for them. If any &s;hall think fit to di&s;pute or critici&s;e on the <HI>Doctrine</HI> here laid down, they may do it &s;ecurely, as if the Author were as much dead, as the&s;e his Labours will &s;hortly be: I hope I know the Value of Time and Pains, and the Va|nity of all Human Speculations better, than to employ them in defending &s;uch Trifles. All I undertake for them, is, That the Facts may be depended upon for their Truth. And the Method and Medicines for their Effica|cy, towards the End, in the Circum&s;tances propos'd. If any Per&s;on under them, &s;hall either amu&s;e him&s;elf, by reading this Pa|per; or lighten his Gain by following its Di|rections, I &s;hall have obtain'd all I propos'd by it.</P>
<P>As to the Account of the <HI>Bath Wa|ters</HI> given here, it came naturally in the way of my Subject; and is &s;uch as the Ob&s;ervations I have made &s;ugge&s;ted to me. I &s;carce know, and have taken no Notice of what others may have written or ob&s;erv'd on the&s;e Waters; nor, indeed, had it been po&s;&s;ible for me, in my pre&s;ent
<PB N="iii" REF="4" MS="y">Situation, being without my Books, and con|fin'd to Bounds, by the Nature of my De&s;ign. I have often ob&s;erv'd, with Ad|miration, the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of Pro|vidence, in furni&s;hing &s;o wonderful an An|tidote, to almo&s;t all the <HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;tem|pers of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution and Climate, which are chiefly owing to Errors of Diet, or rather, as a &s;acred Writer expre&s;&s;es it, To <HI>Idlene&s;s and Fulne&s;s of Bread.</HI> The Rank|ne&s;s of the Soil; the Richne&s;s of the Provi&s;ions; the living &s;o much on Fle&s;h Meats; the Incon|&s;tancy of the Weather, and the indulging in &s;edentary Amu&s;ements, or &s;peculative Stu|dies, directly leading thereto. To remedy all which, <HI>kind Heaven</HI> has provided <HI>Bath Waters</HI> as the mo&s;t <HI>Sovereign Re&s;torative</HI> in all the Weakne&s;&s;es of the <HI>Concoctive Powers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE Introduction. <HI>Page 1. &sect;. 1.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the rea&s;on why, of two Per&s;ons in all other Circum&s;tances the &s;ame, the one has the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other is free from it, is, That the <HI>&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els</HI> of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on in their <HI>original Confor|mation</HI> are narrower and more &s;tiff than tho&s;e of the other. <HI>p. 2. &sect;. 2.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of an acquired <HI>Gout</HI> in the fir&s;t Per&s;on, or tho&s;e born of &s;ound Pa|rents; is the abundance of <HI>Tartarous, Urinous,</HI> or other Salts introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. <HI>p. 2. &sect;. 3.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we learn the rea&s;on why, on the fir&s;t Attacks of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwi&s;e healthy People, the Humours generally fall on the Joynts of the Limbs. <HI>p. 4. &sect;. 4.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may likewi&s;e &s;ee the rea&s;on, why the fir&s;t <HI>Fits</HI> enrage and remit once in twenty four Hours: why the whole <HI>Fit</HI> la&s;ts fourteen Days; and la&s;tly, why the <HI>Acce&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ions</HI> of tho&s;e broken
<PB REF="6">with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only in fourteen Days: And why the whole <HI>Duration</HI> in &s;uch is made up of &s;everal &s;uch <HI>Acce&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ions. p. 4. &sect;. 5.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may di&s;cover the rea&s;on why <HI>Gou|ty</HI> Per&s;ons are People of good natural Parts, large Feeders, and long-liv'd. <HI>p. 6. &sect;. 6.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may conclude, that a <HI>Fit</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI> is an Effort of Nature to throw off this abundance of Salts, through the more &s;tiff and narrow <HI>Strainers;</HI> or we may con&s;ider it as a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of a putrid Fever, where the noxious Humour is di&s;charg'd on &s;ome of the Mu&s;cles or Joynts. <HI>Ibid. &sect;. 7.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may di&s;cover the Vanity of all Pretenders to an <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and certain Remedy for the <HI>Gout. p. 7. &sect;. 8.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence there can be but two direct ways of treating the <HI>Gout;</HI> one by widening the Capacities of the <HI>&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els;</HI> the other by le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of the Salts. <HI>p. 8. &sect;. 9.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Difference between <HI>Hereditary</HI> and <HI>Acquired Gouts. p. 8. &sect;. 10.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>From hence is concluded the Nece&s;&s;ity of a much more &s;trict Management in an <HI>He|reditary</HI>
<PB REF="7" MS="y">than in an <HI>Acquir'd Gout. p. 9. &sect;. 11.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of Labour and Exerci&s;e in the <HI>Gout;</HI> to which however, two Con|ditions mu&s;t be added: <HI>1.</HI> That it be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t too violent: <HI>2.</HI> That a moderate Diet be joyn'd to it. <HI>Ibid. &sect;. 12.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Two ways of le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> in the Blood. The fir&s;t by a vegetable Diet, and the Inconveniences thereof. <HI>Cor|naro</HI>'s Diet recommended. <HI>p. 11. &sect;. 13.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The other way is by <HI>Evacuations</HI> in the In|tervals, and by a gentle &s;low Per&s;pira|tion in the Fits. <HI>p. 13. &sect;. 14.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Secondary</HI> Methods of relieving the <HI>Gout</HI> are two: <HI>1. Dilution</HI> by proper Liquids, &s;uch as <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>German Spaa</HI> Water, or other <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Waters; <HI>Dwarf Al|der Tea, Trifoil Tea,</HI> light, quick <HI>Green Tea,</HI> &s;mall <HI>&s;picy Bitters</HI> on Wa|ter, and the like. <HI>p. 14. &sect;. 15.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2.</HI> Strengthners of the In&s;truments of <HI>Di|ge&s;tion:</HI> the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark e&s;pecially; where its Virtues and Qualities are ex|plain'd. <HI>p. 15. &sect;. 16.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicines in the <HI>Gout</HI> con&s;ider'd. A <HI>Salivation</HI> will bani&s;h the <HI>Gout</HI> for &s;ome time; but then
<PB REF="8">it tears and rends the &s;mall <HI>Fibres,</HI> whereby the future <HI>Fits</HI> become more painful and ob&s;tinate. <HI>p. 17. &sect;. 17.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Method by which one is to treat him|&s;elf under the Fit, in its beginning, mid|dle and end. <HI>p. 19. &sect;. 18.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Opiats</HI> not to be given in the <HI>Gout,</HI> but in the la&s;t Extremity; with two ways of or|dering Forms of &s;uch Medicines. <HI>p. 21. &sect;. 19.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner of treating the <HI>Gouty</HI> after the Pain is over: <HI>Stomach</HI> Purgers fir&s;t, then <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> Milk is recommended; and la&s;tly, <HI>Spaa</HI> or <HI>Bath</HI> Waters with <HI>Aro|matick</HI> Bitters. <HI>p. 22. &sect;. 20.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Rhubarb</HI> recommended as an excellent Pre|&s;ervative from the <HI>Gout,</HI> taken in the In|tervals of the <HI>Fits;</HI> with the Rea&s;ons there|of. <HI>p. 23. &sect;. 21.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The manner of u&s;ing <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> with other <HI>&s;uccedaneous</HI> Purgatives, in ca&s;e of its di&s;agreeing. <HI>p. 25. &sect;. 22.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sulphur,</HI> and its <HI>Flowers,</HI> recommended as the mo&s;t noble of all Medicines, for the Cure of the <HI>Gout,</HI> with the Rea&s;ons there|of; its Nature and Qualities, and the man|ner of u&s;ing it. <HI>p. 26. &sect;. 23.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Several <HI>Dilutors</HI> recommended, e&s;pecially a
<PB REF="9" MS="y">weak Decoction of the <HI>Bark</HI> of the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Sar&s;a;</HI> with Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Ro&s;elli</HI>'s Drops; and the famous <HI>Pox Doctor</HI>'s <HI>Me|dicines. p. 31. &sect;. 24.</HI></ITEM>

<P><MILESTONE N="I" UNIT="&sect;."> _DE&s;igning this Paper for the In&s;truction and Re|lief of my particular Friend, I &s;hall only make &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, as directly tend to that Purpo&s;e; Pa&s;&s;ing by all <HI>Theories</HI> of the Di&s;temper, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with giving the Rea&s;on of my
<PB N="2" REF="14">Opinions. For after having laid down two <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> (which will be found the Principles of my Rea&s;oning through this Di&s;cour&s;e) I proceed to the Ob&s;ervations them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="II" UNIT="&sect;."> <HI>Prop.</HI> 1. Of two Men having all o|ther Circum&s;tances alike, as near as may be; Of the &s;ame Parents; Born Healthy; Of the &s;ame Stature, Complexion, Diet, Air, Exerci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It &s;eems to me impo&s;|&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign a &s;olid Rea&s;on, why the One &s;hou'd be afflicted with the <HI>Gout,</HI> the O|ther be ab&s;olutely free from it, but this, That the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on mu&s;t be in their natural<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Make.</NOTE> Confor|mation narrower and more<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ten&s;e.</NOTE> &s;tiff, than tho&s;e of the Other, who is free from the <HI>Gout,</HI> in re&s;pect of their common Stature and Size. For thereby the Crude and Gro&s;s Humours, which are confin'd, or pa&s;s with Pain, in the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on, will ea&s;i|ly flee off by Per&s;piration and the other Drains of the Body, in the Per&s;on free from the <HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><MILESTONE N="III" UNIT="&sect;."> <HI>Prop.</HI> 2. The Cau&s;e of an acquir'd <HI>Gout</HI> in the fir&s;t Per&s;on, or in tho&s;e born of &s;ound Parents, &s;eems to me, to be the
<PB N="3" REF="15">Abundance of Tartarous, Urinous, or o|ther Salts, introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. Salts &s;eem neither to peri&s;h, nor to be begotten; but to be con&s;tant and incorruptible Parts of Animal and Vege|table Bodies. The Delicacy and Flavour of Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, is entirely owing to their abounding with a fine, &s;oft, oyly, or urinous Salt, as is evident in Veni&s;on and Wild Fowl. Wines, of all kinds, have a grea|ter or le&s;&s;er Quantity of Tartar in them: And other &s;trong Liquors abound in their peculiar Salts, in Proportion to their Strength. Spirits are nothing but a great Quantity of Vegetable Salts crowded to|gether in a little Water and Oyl. The&s;e Salts receiv'd in abundance, but neither &s;ufficiently broke by the Dige&s;tive Powers, nor driven out of the Habit by due Exer|ci&s;e; but by their Plenty and Nearne&s;s, u|niting in greater Clu&s;ters, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily form Ob&s;tructions, and give Pain, when, by the Force of the Circulation, they are thru&s;t through narrower and &s;tiffer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. Nothing either receiv'd or bred within the Body, be&s;ides the&s;e Salts, can account for this Difference.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="16">
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="IV" UNIT="&sect;."> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 1. Hence we may learn the Rea&s;on why, on the fir&s;t Attacks of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwi&s;e healthy People, the Humours generally fall on the Joints of the Limbs: Becau&s;e, in the Joints, the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els are more compre&s;s'd, by the larger Heads or Protuberancy of the Bones, and are thereby render'd narrower and more readily ob&s;tructed. The&s;e Ob&s;tructions fall on the Joints of the Limbs; becau&s;e of the greater Length of the&s;e &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, be|tween the Heart, the Origin of the Motion of all the Fluids, and the&s;e Joints; their other Extremity: Whereby the Quickne&s;s of the Circulation dimini&s;hing, Ob&s;truc|tions are there more readily form'd.</P>
<P N="2"><MILESTONE N="V" UNIT="&sect;."> <HI>Coroll.</HI> 2. Hence likewi&s;e we may &s;ee the Rea&s;on, why the fir&s;t Fits, of other|wi&s;e healthy Per&s;ons, Enrage and Remit once in Four and Twenty Hours. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When it begins to enrage.</NOTE> Ac|ce&s;s being at Sun-&s;et, and the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When it begins to be ea&s;ier.</NOTE> Remi&s;&s;ion about Day-break. Why the whole Fit in &s;uch la&s;ts about fourteen Days. And la&s;t|ly, why the particular Acce&s;&s;es and Re|mi&s;&s;ions, of Per&s;ons advanc'd in Years, and broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only once in fourteen Days. And why the whole
<PB N="5" REF="17">Duration of the Fit is made up of &s;everal &s;uch Acce&s;&s;es and Remi&s;&s;ions in equal Times. In the fir&s;t Stages of the <HI>Gout,</HI> the Fluids being le&s;s Sizy and Glutinous, their Salts and Sizine&s;s are &s;ooner broken and di&s;&s;olv'd, by the Action of the Solids in the Circulation; and are thereby &s;ooner brought into a Condition to be carry'd off by Per&s;piration; which makes an Acce&s;s and a Remi&s;&s;ion. The greater Weight and Gro&s;sne&s;s of the Air (which hinders Per&s;piration) at Sun-&s;et, beyond what it is at Day-break, together with the particu|lar Degree of Sizine&s;s, &s;eems to determine the Times. The greater Degree of Sizi|ne&s;s in the Fluids, of People advanc'd in Years, and broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> leng|thens out the Duration of the&s;e Acce&s;&s;es and Remi&s;&s;ions.

<P><MILESTONE N="XIII" UNIT="&sect;."> There be two direct Ways of le&s;&s;|ening the Quantity of the Salts, which produce the <HI>Gout.</HI> The fir&s;t is, by a total Ab&s;tinence from, or a great Ab&s;temiou&s;|ne&s;s in Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h and &s;trong Liquors, which introduce tho&s;e Salts into human Fluids: But this Cour&s;e is never to be undertaken, but with great Caution, and in the la&s;t Extremity: For the&s;e two Rea|&s;ons; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e an entire Vegetable Diet weakens all the dige&s;tive Powers, and all the Functions of Life; impoveri&s;hes

<P><MILESTONE N="XIV" UNIT="&sect;."> The other direct way of bani&s;h|ing the Salts out of the Habit is by Evacuati|ons. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> otherwi&s;e a mo&s;t accu|rate Ob&s;erver of Nature, and a mo&s;t ju|dicious Practitioner, has been the Occa|&s;ion, I think, of a great Mi&s;take in the Management of the <HI>Gout;</HI> by forbidding almo&s;t all Evacuations, either in the Fit, or in the Intervals, for fear of weakening the Con&s;titution. There are two Sea&s;ons, to wit, Spring and Fall, when the Peri|odical Fits of regular <HI>Gouts</HI> commonly hap|pen; which I con&s;ider as Cardinal and Critical Di&s;charges, under general and me|chanical Influences, for purifying the Blood, and di&s;charging the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts: In which, Nature is no more to be di&s;|turb'd in its Operations (I mean as to pur|ging, for even then a gentle, &s;low, con|&s;tant and uniform Per&s;piration and Breath|ing Sweat may be promoted, not only &s;afe|ly, but with great Advantage) than in the Monthly Purgations of the Sex. But in light, flying Touches of the <HI>Gout,</HI> out
<PB N="14" REF="26">of the&s;e Sea&s;ons; and in the Intervals of the Fits, gentle, warm, &s;tomachick Purgers will be an excellent Remedy to &s;end the&s;e a going, to le&s;&s;en the Fits, and lengthen the Intervals. A Per&s;on out of the Pain and Inflammation of the Fits, and in their Intervals (except his natural Di&s;po&s;ition to breed another Fit) is, to all Intentions of Medicines, the &s;ame as a well Per&s;on.

<P><MILESTONE N="XVI" UNIT="&sect;."> Strengthners of the In&s;truments of Dige&s;tion, are an excellent Remedy in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> If the Dige&s;tions be true and good; the Parts of the <HI>Chyle</HI> be made &s;ufficiently &s;mall, and the Circu|lation be full and compleat (all which are the common Effects of Stomachick Medi|cines) the Salts will be le&s;s; the Ob&s;truc|tions of the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els fewer, and the Impurities of the Fluids will more ea&s;ily

<PB N="24" REF="36">now to recommend &s;ome &s;pecial Medi|cines, which have been found u&s;eful in this Ca&s;e. It is certain that great Ab&s;ti|nence from Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and Wines, would prevent the Fluids from being overloaded with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts. It is al&s;o certain, that if the Food be carried out before it is di|ge&s;ted, it will be pretty near the &s;ame Thing, as if the Quantity carry'd out, had not been taken down. Now if a Medicine can be found, that without weakening the Stomach and Bowels, &s;hall carry off the greater part of the Food, before it is quite robb'd of its Salts, it can't fail to be of great U&s;e in the Inter|vals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For this Purpo&s;e, I wou'd recommend fine Rhubarb, taken regular|ly once, twice, or oftner a Week, in &s;uch a Do&s;e, as to procure two or three Mo|tions: For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e it is an excellent Stomach Bitter, as is e|vident from its Ta&s;te, and from the &s;harp Appetite it gives tho&s;e that take it fre|quently. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e it is one of the noble&s;t A&s;tringents hitherto known, as is evident from its Cure of Fluxes, and inte&s;tine <HI>Haemorrhages;</HI> and from the Tightne&s;s it leaves on the Bowels. <HI>Third|ly,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="37">Becau&s;e it requires neither Diet, nor keeping warm, nor any other particular Management; and yet taken frequently and regularly, it will carry off any Pro|portion of the Food one plea&s;es; and &s;o reduce the Dier, as near as needs be, to <HI>Cornaro's,</HI> which, in Article XIII, has been &s;hewn to be of &s;o excellent U&s;e in the <HI>Gout.</HI> I knew a Noble Lord, of great Worth, and much <HI>Gout,</HI> who, by taking from the Hands of a Quack, a Dram of Rhubarb, ting'd with <HI>Cochineal</HI> to di&s;gui&s;e it, every Morning for the Space of &s;ix Weeks, liv'd in Health for four Years after, with|out any Symptom of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXII" UNIT="&sect;."> It is worth here taking Notice, that all the Preparations of this Medicine &s;erve only to &s;poil it.

<P><MILESTONE N="XXIII" UNIT="&sect;."> Next to Rhubarb, and all Cir|cum&s;tances con&s;ider'd, even far before it, I would recommend <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as one of the be&s;t Remedies in the Intervals of

Its principal Qualities are the&s;e. 1. The Parts of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and tho&s;e of Light and Fire, act mutually upon one another, more powerfully than tho&s;e of other Bodies. It is to their <HI>Sulphur</HI> that Bodies owe re|flecting and refracting Virtues; from whence its Inflammability proceeds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton's <HI>Treati&s;e of Light and Colours,</HI> 1 <HI>Edit. in</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>towards the end.</HI></NOTE> The Particles of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies receive and retain tho&s;e of Light and Fire, more &s;trong|ly than any other Bodies: And the Rays of Light and Particles of Fire, &s;eparate, move and turn the Parts of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bo|dies into Fire and Flame. 2. The Parts of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies are very &s;mall, even &s;maller than tho&s;e of Water it &s;elf, where|by
<PB N="28" REF="40">it comes to pa&s;s that they will enter tho&s;e &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, where Water it &s;elf (our be&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al Diluent) can't come; this is evident from hence, that Water will not di&s;&s;olve <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and that no Moi&s;ture will &s;tick to fat Sub&s;tan|ces, or the Feathers of Water Fowl: As al&s;o from its cure of all cutaneous Foul|ne&s;s; which it cou'd never effectuate but by entering all tho&s;e &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, which &s;carce any other Medicine can en|ter. And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> by its di&s;&s;olving the &s;izy Juices of the &s;malle&s;t internal <HI>Glands,</HI> when ob&s;tructed; particularly tho&s;e of the <HI>Lungs, Me&s;entery</HI> and <HI>Rectum;</HI> as in the humorous <HI>A&s;thma, Scrophula</HI> and <HI>Piles.</HI> 3. <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies will readily unite with, and de&s;troy the Effects of all <HI>Saline</HI> Parti|cles, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the acid kind. And in this their great Energy &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t. <HI>Sulphur</HI> yields the mo&s;t piercing, active, and agreeable <HI>Acid</HI> in the World; &s;uch as Spirit of <HI>Sulphur, Gas</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and the like. 4. The fat and oily Parts of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> like other fat and unctuous Bodies, are the lighte&s;t, the mo&s;t cohe|rent, and the mo&s;t &s;pringy of all Bodies.

For the Sea Water be|ing fat by the Oil of the Sea Fi&s;h conti|nually corrupting there, and bitter and &s;alti&s;h from its &s;aline Rocks, produces in proper Ne&s;ts natural <HI>Sulphur.</HI></Q> And Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;ays, in his la&s;t Edition of his Opticks, <HI>pag.</HI> 359. <Q>By di&s;&s;olv|ing Flower of Brim&s;tone in Oil of Tur|pentine, and di&s;tilling the Solution, it is found, that <HI>Sulphur</HI> is compos'd of an inflammable thick Oil, or fat <HI>Bitu|men,</HI> an acid Salt, a very thick Earth, and a little Metal: The three fir&s;t were found not much unequal to one ano|ther; the fourth in &s;o &s;mall a Quantity, as &s;carce to be worth the con&s;idering.</Q>
<PB N="30" REF="42">Join all the&s;e Qualities together, and you have one of the mo&s;t admirable Remedies in the World, for all Intentions in the Cure of the <HI>Gout:</HI> By its agreeable Ta&s;te and Lightne&s;s on the Stomach, (e&s;pecial|ly when wa&s;h'd down with any milky Ve|hicle) its Tenacity, Ropine&s;s and Ela&s;ti|city; the &s;mallne&s;s of its Parts; their Ef|ficacy in de&s;troying the Mi&s;chief of all &s;a|line Particles, with their natural Warmth, join'd to the Activity of its acid Salt, (making it a kind of natural Soap) it en|ters the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, where no other Diluent, hitherto known, can come; clean&s;es their in&s;ides from the Foulne&s;s that &s;ticks to them; imbibes and retains all the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and carries them out of the Body by Per&s;piration; &s;oftens, &s;mooths and relaxes the parch'd and &s;tif|fen'd <HI>Fibres;</HI> and by leaving &s;ome of its oily Parts on their Surfaces, &s;heaths and defends them from the Points of the Salts afterwards introduc'd.

<P><MILESTONE N="XXIV" UNIT="&sect;."> E&s;pecially if to the&s;e be added plentiful Dilution by &s;ome Blood-warm Infu&s;ion of a &s;picy and diuretick Plant in Water, &s;o as to provoke a gentle Brea|thing Sweat, and pa&s;s freely by Urine. Thus large Draughts of Sage, Dwarf-El|der, Buckbean, or Green Tea; but e&s;pe|cially of weak Whey made on old Moun|tain, drunk Blood warm, and on an empty Stomach, and join'd to any of the now mention'd Medicines, will be of great Ad|vantage in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout;</HI> by diluting and breaking its Salts, and car|rying them off by Per&s;piration and Urine. And certainly <HI>Ro&s;elli</HI>'s Drops, (perhaps the <HI>Tinctura Metallorum</HI> &s;omehow alter'd)
<PB N="32" REF="44">which were &s;aid to work gently by Stool and Sweat, in the Hands of a prudent and knowing Phy&s;ician, had been an admira|ble Remedy, as an&s;wering both the Inten|tions mention'd, in the Intervals of the Fits; and even in the Fits them&s;elves, it had not been without its U&s;e (always except|ing the <HI>Vernal</HI> and <HI>Autumnal</HI> regular Fits) had he dealt with recent <HI>Gouts,</HI> and firm Con&s;titutions only. That which I wou'd particularly recommend here, is, a weak Decoction of the <HI>BARK</HI> of <HI>Sar&s;a</HI> Root (in the <HI>BARK</HI> the Virtues of the Plants chiefly con&s;i&s;t: For being repleni&s;h'd with mo&s;t part of, if not all the Juice-circulat|ing Ve&s;&s;els, it contains all its Salts and mo&s;t active Parts; and being Spungy and Tender, it is thereby more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted: And where Roots are mo&s;t in U&s;e, the <HI>Bark</HI> of the Root is more eminently u&s;e|ful, for the Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;ign'd: As al&s;o becau&s;e, towards the End of the <HI>Autumn,</HI> when Roots are gather'd, the Cold has already driven the Juices into their <HI>Bark.</HI> And this may be one Rea&s;on why the fa|mous Pox-Doctor &s;ucceeds in &s;ome Ca&s;es, when mi&s;manag'd <HI>Mercurial</HI> Treatments have fail'd: His Diet-Drink chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="33" REF="45">of a Decoction of the Bark of this Root: His Pill is <HI>Mercurial,</HI> perhaps the <HI>Arcanum Corallinum,</HI> or <HI>Panacaea,</HI> and the&s;e two per&s;i&s;ted in for &s;o long a Time, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;weeten the tainted Juices, and expel the entangled and gro&s;&s;er <HI>Mer|curial</HI> Parts, which clu&s;tering together, cou'd not perform the Circulation, but were retain'd within the Habit, by for|mer mi&s;manag'd Salivations, and thereby render'd ineffectual to the Cure; e&s;pecial|ly, if to the&s;e be added, the low and &s;tar|ving Diet he pre&s;cribes. For I have heard of a famous Sea-Commander, who effect|ually cur'd the fir&s;t Stages of <HI>Venereal</HI> Di|&s;tempers by living twenty Days on <HI>Water Gruel</HI> only, in which a little <HI>Cream</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> had been fir&s;t di&s;&s;olv'd; (and high|er Degrees of the &s;ame by the like Diet continu'd twice the Time;) with a little Milk, drunk freely Blood warm every Morning, which I have known wonder|fully relieve <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons, when drunk all the Winter between the <HI>Cardinal</HI> Fits. And even Cow's Milk warm, taken for Breakfa&s;t and Supper, has been of great Service to tho&s;e <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons who drink
<PB N="34" REF="46">not much Wine; for tho&s;e who drink Wine freely, have too hot and &s;our Sto|machs to deal in Milk.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXV" UNIT="&sect;."> Even drinking freely of light, clear Spring Water after full Meals, and indulging in &s;trong Liquors, will be found of great U&s;e in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is well known that warm Water alone, drunk in a Morning fa&s;ting freely, and at Meals, from its Heat, its Dilution, and clean&s;ing Qualities, has been a &s;overeign Remedy in re&s;toring decay'd Appetites, and &s;trengthning weak Dige&s;tions, when other more pompous Medicines have fail'd. <HI>Low|er</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that Per&s;ons that have drunk beyond the Rules of Tempe|rance, may be much reliev'd from the ill Effects of it, by expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the free Air, to cool the Blood, and to force off the Liquors by Urine.

The Learn'd have been divided, and much perplex'd about the Heat of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters.

Wherefore there can be no Nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="37" REF="49">of having Recour&s;e to <HI>Vulcano</HI>'s or &s;ubter|raneous Fires, to account for this Appear|ance. There are no burning Mountains known in this our <HI>Northern</HI> Climate; and 'tis pretty hard to conceive, how Fires &s;hou'd have burn'd &s;o long under Ground without a Vent, or any other remarkable Sign. The <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is evident to the Sen&s;es, &s;wimming in large Clu&s;ters on the Tops of the <HI>Baths</HI> mix'd with Earth, and &s;ome vegetable Sub|&s;tances, wherewith the Guides commonly gild Silver; and is found an excellent Re|medy in <HI>Scurvies, Lepro&s;ies, Ring-worms,</HI> and other <HI>Foulne&s;&s;es</HI> of the Skin. The Steel is manife&s;ted by the blewi&s;h Tincture given to the Water from the Pump, by an Infu&s;ion of Nut-gall. It is true, this Tinct|ure is neither &s;o deep, nor is it to be had from the Water, in any &s;hort Time after it comes hot from the Pump, thereby to manife&s;t any great Quantity of Steel in the Compo&s;ition, &s;uch as can have the full Proportion to the Experiment now men|tioned. But, to &s;et this in a clearer Light, let us put together the&s;e Con&s;iderations. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That upon Di&s;tillation of <HI>Bath</HI> Wa|ter, there remains little in the Bottom of
<PB N="38" REF="50">the Gla&s;s, but the common <HI>Calx</HI> or Sea Salt, that is found in the Di&s;tillation of Spring Water, if we except &s;ome Sand or Earth, that is forc'd up by the Violence of the Pump; wherefore the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters not being impregnated with any Quantity of a &s;aline Mixture, can retain nothing in their own proper Sub&s;tance but the lighte&s;t Parts of the Steel and <HI>Sulphur. Secondly,</HI> That this Water is as fully impregnated with <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as it can bear, has been al|ready &s;hewn: And that there mu&s;t be a greater Proportion of Steel in <HI>Bath</HI> Water than is manife&s;ted to the Sen&s;es, or di&s;|cover'd by any Experiment hitherto made, is evident from its healing Effects, which no known Medicine but Steel can bring a|bout, or account for: None but tho&s;e who have &s;een it, can believe the wonder|ful Efficacy it has, in mo&s;t Chronical Ca|&s;es. What, but Steel, in a few Weeks, can make the Blood, from a white blewi&s;h or Tallow Hue, re&s;i&s;ting the Knife, like Glew, &s;wimming in its <HI>Serum,</HI> like an I&s;land amid&s;t the Ocean, look all of a Piece, of a Scarlet Colour, and a due Proportion be|tween its nouri&s;hing and its watery Parts? Nothing but Steel can make a pale a&s;h-colour'd
<PB N="39" REF="51">Countenance, hollow and deep Eyes, no Appetite, little Strength, and le&s;s Sleep; eat, and drink, and &s;leep, look gay and &s;leek, like the be&s;t Health. Thou&s;ands of &s;uch In&s;tances may be &s;een every Sea&s;on at the&s;e healthful Springs. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Effects of <HI>Sulphur</HI> in brid|ling the &s;en&s;ible Appearances and Opera|tions of mo&s;t active Medicines, is very well known. In&s;tances of which, in na|tural Bodies, are, <HI>Antimony</HI> and native <HI>Cin|nabar;</HI> in artificial ones, <HI>Aethiops</HI> Mineral, and <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of <HI>Antimony:</HI> In all which the <HI>Mercury</HI> is &s;o bridled up by the <HI>Sul|phur,</HI> that none of their &s;en&s;ible Opera|tions and Appearances are felt, while they produce the mo&s;t wonderful Changes on animal Bodies. I cannot pa&s;s over <HI>Aethiops</HI> Mineral without pre&s;&s;ing its more univer|&s;al U&s;e than, for ought I know, it has yet had in common Practice.

<PB N="41" REF="53">and bridle the &s;en&s;ible Appearances and Ef|fects of the mo&s;t active Bodies, and yet not de&s;troy their healthful and medical virtues; it is plain, that <HI>Bath</HI> Waters mu&s;t owe their Heat to a Mixture of &s;teely and &s;ulphurous Particles; and their healthful Effects to a greater Proportion of Steel, than is &s;en&s;ible, or ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by any Experiment hitherto made, join'd to a light <HI>Sulphur,</HI> who&s;e Virtues and Efficacy in all Chronical Ca&s;es, we have already &s;hewn. The Moun|tains which &s;urround the Place, which eve|ry Body now knows, to be but the Ne&s;ts of Minerals, and the Receptacles of the Wa|ters, which feed the Springs, (which Moun|tains are continued even to the Sea) confirm this Opinion. The manner I conceive thus: The Dews drilling and dropping through the Cranies of the Mountains, fall upon a Bed of Iron Oar, and are there as fully im|pregnated with <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Particles as &s;uch Water can bear; and gently owzing down upon a Ne&s;t of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and there ferment|ing to &s;uch a degree, that requiring more room, they bubble up at the Foot of the Mountains, with their &s;ulphurous Spoils, and furni&s;h out this healing and bal&s;amick Fluid. All hot Waters &s;eem chiefly to con|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="54">of the&s;e two Principles; and to differ on|ly as the <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Steel</HI> predominates in them. Where the <HI>Sulphur</HI> predominates, they are hotter, more nau&s;eous, and more purgative. Of the three hot <HI>European</HI> Wa|ters of Note, the <HI>Aix la Chapelle, Bourbon,</HI> and <HI>Bath;</HI> the fir&s;t abounds more eminently in <HI>Sulphur,</HI> which makes its Heat, Nau&s;e|ou&s;ne&s;s and Purgative Faculty &s;o great, that few weak Stomachs can bear its Heat and Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s; and fewer weak Con&s;tituti|ons, the Violence of its purging. The <HI>Bourbon</HI> are of a middle Nature, between the <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> and the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, and are le&s;s hot, nau&s;eous and purgative than the <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> but more than the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. The <HI>Bath</HI> partake le&s;s of the <HI>Sul|phur</HI> and more of the <HI>Steel</HI> than either of the&s;e two; and are by far the mo&s;t plea&s;ant; of a milky Ta&s;te, never purge, except they be drunk either too fa&s;t, or in too great Quantities, and always mend the Appetite, and rai&s;e the Spirits. The weake&s;t hot Wa|ters are but of little U&s;e, except in the low|e&s;t Ca&s;es, and in hectick or con&s;umptive Con&s;titutions; but for medical U&s;es, the weaker hot Waters may be made pretty near equal to the &s;tronger by Evaporation, as to
<PB N="43" REF="55">the &s;ulphurous Principle; as the &s;tronger may be brought down to the weaker by Di|lution, as I have experienc'd; tho' Nature be always the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Ope|rator. But neither the &s;ame Proportion of <HI>Steel,</HI> nor <HI>Sulphur,</HI> nor Heat, indifferently fit all Con&s;titutions. Generally the Strength (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Quantity of <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI>) of the &s;ame hot Waters is in proportion to their Heat; and therefore to fit the &s;ame Waters to weaker Con&s;titutions, they need only be drunk proportionably cooler.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XXVIII" UNIT="&sect;."> The <HI>Bath</HI> Waters having &s;uch an Origin, and &s;uch Qualities, mu&s;t needs be an excellent Remedy in the <HI>Gout,</HI> and o|ther Chronical Ca&s;es, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons; 1.

But this &s;eems to me a mere groundle&s;s Jealou&s;y: For in regular <HI>Gouts,</HI> when the Fit is over, it is to be &s;uppos'd, that the <HI>Gouty</HI> Fluid or Matter is mo&s;tly or altogether &s;pent, and the Fluids in a healthy &s;ound Condition. And therefore it might be as rea&s;onably doubted, if in the Intervals of two putrid Fevers (of which many have had more than two in their Life-time) a Per&s;on might &s;afely bath.

And 'tis Matter of Fact, that tho&s;e who have been crippl'd by the fixing of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts upon the Joints, or di&s;abl'd by the Tenderne&s;s of the Parts, have been ex|tremely reliev'd by a long Cour&s;e of drinking

<P><MILESTONE N="XXX" UNIT="&sect;."> The other Difficulty is, how the &s;ame hot Water &s;hou'd relax contracted <HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheumati&s;m;</HI> and yet contract and brace relax'd <HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the Pal&s;ie and wa&s;ted Limbs.

Since all the Fluids of the Body are contain'd in Ve&s;&s;els, Con|traction can ari&s;e from nothing but from the Blood and other Fluids (or whatever is the Cau&s;e of Mu&s;cular Motion) Their being retain'd and ob&s;tructed by their Si|zine&s;s; or from &s;ome external Injury, in the Sub&s;tance of the Mu&s;cle it &s;elf; where|by it becomes fuller and firmer, and &s;o acts as upon its Office of Contraction. Relaxation, upon the other hand, is an Ob&s;truction of the Nerves or Ve&s;&s;els of the Fluids, before they arrive at the Mu&s;cles; as is &s;een in Pal&s;ies and the Nervous <HI>A|trophy</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="59">of the Limbs; &s;o that in both Ca|&s;es, Ob&s;tructions are the Cau&s;e both of Contraction and Relaxation.

They have both the &s;ame Co|lour, Ta&s;te and Smell; they yield both the &s;ame Principles, and produce the &s;ame Ap|pearances, when treated chymically. They have both the &s;ame internal Texture of Parts, as far as can be known, and even the &s;ame outward Shape, when unbroken and unconfin'd by hard Sub&s;tances; and they generally happen to one and the &s;ame Per|&s;on: At lea&s;t it &s;eldom comes to pa&s;s, that any one is much troubl'd with the <HI>Gout,</HI> but he has the <HI>Stone</HI> at la&s;t.

Whether this was owing to the le&s;&s;er Quantity of Salts in tho&s;e Liquors than in Wine, or to the Slipperine&s;s they induce upon the Bowels and other Ve&s;&s;els, or to both, I will not here take upon me to determine. But I believe the Fact is, both in the <HI>Stone</HI> and acquired <HI>Gouts,</HI> that tho&s;e who only drink Malt Liquors, without Wine or Spirits, are &s;eldom violently afflic|ted with either.

And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on in the Intervals, the Red is preferable to the White: Tho' neither of them, in either Ca&s;e, be u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary, but becau&s;e Cu&s;tom or Habit, which it is not &s;afe to alter &s;uddenly, has made them &s;o.

Tho&s;e who know how greatly Foulne&s;s and Uncleanline&s;s promote Epide|mical, Pe&s;tilential and Infectious Di&s;tem|pers, can only tell what Cleanne&s;s contri|butes to Health. The <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People (who&s;e Lazine&s;s, in other Things, is ow|ing to their Climate) have found Cold Ba|thing and Ablution &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their Health, that they have made it a part of their Religion, as it is a Precept of a Reli|gion of a nobler Extract, from whence they borrow'd it. If the modern Doctrine be true, as I really think it is, that the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Fibres,</HI> or tho&s;e of the la&s;t Divi&s;ion, in ani|mal Bodies, be not open and pervious, but &s;olid; then it may be affirm'd, that warm Water (I mean pure Element, endu'd with no Medical Principle) by the active Power of its Heat, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily relax &s;uch <HI>Fi|bres.</HI> And that cold Water from the <HI>Nitre,</HI> which produces its Coldne&s;s, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily contract them. The Tumour of the <HI>Gout,</HI> like other inflammatory Swellings, is owing to an Ob&s;truction, or to the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours flowing fa&s;ter by the <HI>Arteries,</HI> than it can be receiv'd by the Veins; the Smalle&s;t or Capillary Ve&s;&s;els are thereby
<PB N="63" REF="75">extended and &s;tretch'd, beyond their natu|ral Power of Re&s;titution; &s;o that when the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is &s;pent by Per&s;piration, or driven into the Veins by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Stroaks of the Circulation; the Ob&s;truction remov'd; and the Pain entirely gone off; the Ve&s;&s;els continue thus widen'd and &s;tretch'd, beyond their Power of Re&s;titu|tion, for a long Time after. And this is the &s;ole Cau&s;e of the long and tedious Weakne&s;s on the Part after the Fit is over; which wou'd yet continue longer, did not the Coolne&s;s and Pre&s;&s;ure of the Ambient Air, and the now &s;ufferable Weight of the Cloathing, give the fir&s;t Impul&s;es to the <HI>Fibres</HI> towards their contracting them&s;elves again: Now nothing in Nature can &s;o rea|dily or &s;o certainly bring this about, as Ba|thing in cold Water: For the <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Water, which is the Cau&s;e of its Coolne&s;s; and al&s;o the uniform equal Pre&s;&s;ure upon the Part, which ari&s;es from its Gravity and Flui|dity, concur to communicate to the <HI>Fibres</HI> a &s;trong and la&s;ting Impul&s;e towards re&s;tor|ing them&s;elves to their natural State of Con|traction.

All the Solids of the Body are made up of &s;mall Threads or Filaments of different Natures and Textures. They are divided into the <HI>Fle&s;hy,</HI> the <HI>Nervous,</HI> the <HI>Membranous,</HI> and the <HI>Bony;</HI> and make up the &s;olid Sub&s;tance of the whole Animal Body: But all of them agree in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree of Springine&s;s or Ela&s;ticity.

Wherein the general Nature of Ela&s;ticity con&s;i&s;ts, or what is the particular Cau&s;e of the eminent Springine&s;s of animal <HI>Fibres,</HI> is as hard to explain as conceive; which notwith&s;tand|ing, is the noble&s;t In&s;trument of all the Actions and Functions of an animated Bo|dy. All the Attempts hitherto made to
<PB N="66" REF="78">di&s;cover the particular Nature of a <HI>Con|tractile</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tractile</HI> Animal <HI>Fibre,</HI> to me &s;eem in&s;ufficient and conjectural. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> has di&s;cover'd, by his Gla&s;&s;es, that the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Fibre</HI> of an <HI>Elephant</HI> is not big|ger than that of the &s;malle&s;t <HI>In&s;ect:</HI> And if the modern Sy&s;tem of Generation be ju&s;t, to wit, That an Animal or Plant comes from another le&s;&s;er one; then Growth is nothing, but the unfolding the original <HI>Membranes</HI> and <HI>Fibres:</HI> And the length of every <HI>Fibre</HI> is the &s;ame in the younge&s;t, as in the full grown Animal or Plant. So Growth and Motion both, that is, the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Animal Life, is owing to the Springine&s;s of the&s;e <HI>Fibres.</HI> The be&s;t Re&s;emblance I can make of them, is that of a long Hair, or &s;mall twi&s;ted Gut, which, when &s;tretch'd to any length beyond its na|tural State, will re&s;tore it &s;elf again to its former Dimen&s;ions.

And here we may ob&s;erve the Difference between more ten&s;e and &s;tif|fer <HI>Fibres,</HI> and more &s;pringy and ela&s;tick ones. All the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body are in a State of <HI>Di&s;ten&s;ion,</HI> as is evident from the gaping Lips of Wounds. Two Per&s;ons may have <HI>Fibres</HI> of the &s;ame Degree of Springine&s;s and Ela&s;ticity; and yet in their natural State, and original Formation, the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the one may be more &s;tretch'd, bent and di&s;tracted, and con&s;equently more &s;tiff and ten&s;e than tho&s;e of the other; whereby the more &s;tiff or ten&s;e <HI>Fibres</HI> mak|ing a greater Re&s;i&s;tance, and being with more Difficulty &s;tretch'd and widen'd, will give more Pain, when a gro&s;s Fluid pa&s;&s;es thro' them, than le&s;s &s;tiff or ten&s;e <HI>Fibres</HI> will.

This Cour&s;e never fails to remove the Violence of the Pain, and to leave only a Weakne&s;s en the Part. To remove the gro&s;&s;er Remains, and &s;trengthen the weak|en'd
<PB N="75" REF="87" MS="y">Part, I order a Dram or two Drams of Flower of Brim&s;tone, for &s;ome time, twice a Day, in a Tea cup full of Milk. If through great Intemperance, or a violent Cold, the Patient relap&s;es, I or|der the Repetition of the former Medicines for a Day or two, which commonly &s;ets it a packing. And la&s;tly, to &s;trengthen the <HI>Primaeviae,</HI> and enliven the Spirits, I advi&s;e <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters with <HI>Steel,</HI> and Bitters with <HI>Volatiles;</HI> and perhaps pumping on the Part affected, which never fails to per|fect the Cure in a genuine <HI>Sciatica.</HI> And I hope it may be of &s;ome u&s;e, to have a Me|thod of Cure for this Di&s;temper, &s;o plainly laid down, &s;o effectual in it &s;elf, &s;o ea&s;y to the Patient, and &s;o re&s;torative of his Con|&s;titution in general, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e Tor|tures and the nau&s;eous Load of Medicines the afflicted are forc'd to go through in common Practice. The great Efficacy of this Cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Aetherial Oyl:</HI> It has been common to pre&s;cribe a few Drops of the Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> in cold <HI>Rheu|mati&s;ms</HI> and fix'd Pains on the Joynts: But this &s;eldom proves effectual in the <HI>Sciatica:</HI> Whereas this <HI>Aetherial Oyl,</HI> having all the Penetration of the Spirit, together with the Softne&s;s and Detergency of the fine&s;t <HI>Bal|&s;am,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="88">but chiefly being of &s;uch Lightne&s;s, that any Quantity of it may be given, that can &s;tay on the Stomach, or be kept down by frequent Draughts of any &s;oft Liquor, e&s;pecially Sack-Whey: which by its Milki|ne&s;s uniting readily with the <HI>Aetherial Oyl;</HI> Penetrates into the lea&s;t and fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, and the mo&s;t &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> opens their Ob&s;tructions; di&s;|&s;olves the glutinous Gellies in the Joints; clean&s;es the in&s;ides of the <HI>Tubes,</HI> and makes all pa&s;s by Per&s;piration. The Rule where|by to accommodate the Do&s;e to the Patient, is to order it &s;o, that it mayn't be &s;o much as to recoil upwards; to prevent which, a large Quantity of Sack-Whey is order'd: And it &s;eldom moves above once downwards; but le&s;t it &s;hou'd go farther, in the &s;ub&s;equent Do&s;es, the Pills take place.</P>
