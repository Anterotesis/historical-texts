<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAVE frequently taken notice of the <HI>Medicine Che&s;ts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In furni&s;hing Medicine Che&s;ts, particular regard mu&s;t be had to the different climates; and to the di&s;orders that are mo&s;t prevalent in tho&s;e countries.&mdash;The &s;ame in Tra|velling Che&s;ts.&mdash;Each per&s;on, knowing their own con&s;titu|tion, will endeavour to accomodate them&s;elves accordingly.</NOTE> in the cabinet-&s;hops, &s;ome containing <HI>&s;ix</HI> bottles, &s;ome <HI>nine,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>twelve;</HI> others larger, with drawers to hold different Medicines; which are extremely convenient in any exigency, and would be more univer&s;ally made u&s;e of, if a &s;imple and &s;afe plan could be adopted: and I think it is a pity no per&s;on has ever given a hint how to fur|ni&s;h tho&s;e &s;mall ones. There are frequently adver|ti&s;ed large Che&s;ts, the plan of which I do not alto|gether approve of; becau&s;e, when a per&s;ons buys one, and takes it many miles in the country, and is out of the &s;everal Medicines, he is obliged to &s;end up to the fir&s;t proprietor, otherwi&s;e they can|not have the &s;ame; therefore all Medicines in the Che&s;ts &s;hould bear the title of the <HI>London Di&s;pen|&s;atory,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5">as directed by the College of Phy&s;icians, unle&s;s there may be &s;omething added more efficacious; and then the Recipe &s;hould be given, or &s;ay where it is taken from.&mdash;I do not mean to enter largely on the Di&s;pen&s;atory, as tho&s;e have done; but only to endeavour at a &s;cheme for furni&s;hing &s;mall ones, from 1 <HI>l.</HI> 1 <HI>s.</HI> to about 4 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> each, fir&s;t co&s;t; (per&s;ons &s;uiting their own &s;tations;) to be ready at any time when any &s;udden illne&s;s &s;hould &s;eize any of the family.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a plan is too obvious, e&s;pe|cially when we con&s;ider the many accidents human nature is &s;ubject to; in which, without immediate help, we are either lo&s;t, or kept in great pain; which would be in a great mea&s;ure prevented, if ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families would keep a &s;mall Che&s;t by them; and particularly tho&s;e who re&s;ide in a country village, often many miles from a town where an Apothecary is to be met with.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;elect &s;uch Medicines as I think nece&s;&s;ary, and choo&s;e tho&s;e chiefly which the the College of Phy&s;icians have ordered the Apothe|caries to keep in their &s;hops; that, by a&s;king for the Medicines by their names, you will always have the right, if you deal with a per&s;on of credit.&mdash; I will not recommend any Medicine where there may be danger in it, without pointing it out likwi&s;e. Electuaries, on account they are &s;o di&s;agreeable to take, I leave out; as I can always &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome|thing more agreeable in a liquid; and, as my de&s;ign is to curtail Phy&s;ic, I &s;hall chiefly confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e Medicines that lie in a &s;mall compa&s;s, who&s;e virtues I have often &s;o happily experienced.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>At my fir&s;t writing of this, I had no thoughts of offering my &s;ervice to the public, to furni&s;h tho&s;e &s;mall Che&s;ts; but, if any per&s;on is de&s;irous of my &s;ervice, I will very readily give my advice, and explain more particularly the Recipes, and Nature of the Medicines, and take care they &s;hall be &s;up|plied with the be&s;t of them: And, as I am the fir&s;t who has endeavoured to make the&s;e &s;mall Che&s;ts univer&s;al, without any re&s;erve; I hope, at lea&s;t, I may meet with candour; and any hints that will improve the whole will be gratefully received, By</P>

<HEAD>ELIXIR PAREGORIC.</HEAD>
<P>This excellent Elixir was invented by Le Mort, a French Surgeon, and was called the Elixir A&s;thmatic. It is a Medicine of great efficacy
<PB N="9" REF="11">in fre&s;h Colds or Coughs, and may be given to children in the Chin-Cough, commonly called the Whooping-Cough. Do&s;e, a tea-&s;poonful, (not more) going to bed. Grown people may take more, up to a tea-&s;poonful and a half. It is a gentle opiate.</P>
<TAILNOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>N. B. Per&s;ons who are &s;ubject to a bad Cough, of long &s;tanding, and Shortne&s;s of Breath, mu&s;t take care not to meddle with it, an account of the Opium in it, which would almo&s;t choak them. When a per&s;on has got a Cold, they &s;hould put on a double night-cap, and a woollen &s;tock|ing round their neck. Children are frequently troubled with a Cough that proceeds from eating tra&s;h, which occa|&s;ions tough phlegm to be lodged in the &s;tomach: in that ca&s;e, or where it is a Whooping-Cough, a gentle vomit of Ipecacoanha wine, (do&s;e, two drams, in any plea&s;ant liquor, for a child of &s;ix years old) may be given; or a gentle purge; as, Take manna, half an ounce; di&s;&s;olve it in a cup of tea; and add Tincture of Jalap, one tea-&s;poonful: but, where Worms are &s;u&s;pected, a do&s;e of Ba&s;ilicon Powder mu&s;t be given.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, in taking of Medicines, to begin with a &s;mall do&s;e, and &s;o increa&s;e or dimini&s;h as you find them operate: by this you will di&s;cover what is commonly called the Con|&s;titution. In Fevers this &s;hould be given very &s;paringly, as it will rather increa&s;e the heat.</P>

<P>This is a valuable compo&s;ition. It cures fre&s;h Aches and Pains, ari&s;ing from Colds, almo&s;t to a wonder. Tho&s;e who are troubled with the Gout, or Rheumati&s;m, mu&s;t u&s;e Opodeldoc.</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e cures the Tooth and Head-Ach, and is the ba&s;is of tho&s;e Tinctures adverti&s;ed. For Outward Pains, rub half an ounce well in before the fire, and wear a flannel. For Ner|vous Cholics, or Gravelly Complaints, it is &s;ome|times u&s;ed. Do&s;e, twenty drops to &s;ixty, for a grown per&s;on. This is a &s;tronger Opiate than the former.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>BALSAM TRAUMATIC, OR, BAUME DE COMMANDEUR.</HEAD>
<P>This is &s;imilar to the Fryar's and Turlington's Bal&s;am, and is u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, viz. Fre&s;h Cuts. It is good for inward Decays, and tickling Coughs. As it is &s;o generally known, I &s;hall not &s;ay any more to recommend it. It is rather thinner than the adverti&s;ed Medi|cines, but no ways inferior.</P>

<P>Where children are the&s;e Drops &s;hould always be at hand; there is not any Medicine of &s;o great efficacy as this is in bringing people out of Fits, when properly applied. I have known a grown per&s;on &s;eized with Fits, which before u&s;ed to hold an hour, and could not be brought to her|&s;elf by any of tho&s;e cruel, mis-judged methods very often made u&s;e of by &s;trangers, as forcing open the hands, pinching, burning, &amp;c. which is wrong. My method was, to pour a pap-&s;poon|ful of the&s;e Drops down the Patient's throat by it&s;elf, and almo&s;t immediately they would reco|ver; if not, I gave the &s;econd, which &s;eldom failed; indeed, I never knew it to fail. It is a &s;afe Medicine for children from one to four years old: I lower it for them by mixing two or three parts water with it, as one tea-&s;poonful of Drops and three of water; when children either purge or vomit, the danger is over: rubbing their limbs and &s;oles of the feet is good. The be&s;t pre&s;erva|tive again&s;t Fits is an I&s;&s;ue, and purge off the acids with Magne&s;ia and Rhubarb. In Lethargy Fits, a &s;trong vomit mu&s;t be forced down, as the Wine of Antimony, the Sal Vitriol; the&s;e two la&s;t Medicines require judgement.</P>

When in perfection, it is very light and thin, pale and almo&s;t colourle&s;s, of great fragrancy, though not quite &s;o agreeable as the Ro&s;emary it&s;elf. It is recommended in the do&s;e of a few drops in nervous and hy&s;teric com|plaints.

<P>Syrups are &s;aturated &s;olutions of &s;ugar made in water, or watery, or vinous infu&s;ions, or in
<PB N="32" REF="34">juices. They were formerly con&s;idered as Me|dicines of much greater importance than they are thought to be at pre&s;ent. Syrups and di&s;tilled waters were for &s;ome ages made u&s;e of as the great alteratives, in&s;omuch that the evacuation of any peccant humour was never attempted till, by a due cour&s;e of the&s;e, it had fir&s;t been regu|larly prepared for expul&s;ion: hence aro&s;e the ex|uberant collection of both which we meet with in Pharmacopoeias, and like errors have pre|vailed in each. As multitudes of di&s;tilled waters have been compounded from materials unfit to give any virtue over the helm, &s;o numbers of Syrups have been prepared of ingredients which, in this form, cannot be taken in &s;ufficient do&s;es to exert their virtues; for two-thirds of a Syrup con&s;i&s;t of &s;ugar, and greate&s;t part of the remain|ing third is an aqueous fluid. Syrups are at pre|&s;ent chiefly regarded as convenient vehicles for Medicines of greater efficacy, and made u&s;e of for &s;weetening Draughts and Juleps; for reducing the lighter Powders into Bolu&s;es, Pills, or Elec|tuaries; and other like purpo&s;es. Some like|wi&s;e may not improperly be con&s;idered as Me|dicines them&s;elves, as tho&s;e of Saffron or Buck|thorn-berries.</P>
