<HEAD>A METHOD OF Preventing or dimini&s;hing Pain, in &s;everal Operations of SURGERY.</HEAD>
<P>IF any of the profe&s;&s;ions were, in a par|ticular manner, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of humane; we might naturally ex|pect it would be that who&s;e particular ob|ject it is, to relieve the &s;ufferings of huma|nity. And, if a greater degree of com|pa&s;&s;ion and &s;ympathy were looked for among one cla&s;s of men than any other, we &s;hould expect to find it in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who pa&s;s their lives in the duties of &s;o benevolent a profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>Phy&s;icians, however, have been accu&s;ed of a want of feeling for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human nature, and &s;urgeons of actual cruelty.</P>
<P>If this accu&s;ation were ju&s;t, it would &s;trike with more force at the arts of medi|cine and &s;urgery them&s;elves, than at the individuals who profe&s;s them. For it is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine, that men of cruel di&s;po&s;itions would be attracted more than others to the &s;tudy of arts, who&s;e aim is the alleviation and removal of &s;ickne&s;s and pain. It mu&s;t therefore be the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e arts, which renders phy&s;icians and &s;ur|geons unfeeling and cruel, and not an ori|ginal unfeeling and cruel di&s;po&s;ition that directed them in their choice of tho&s;e arts.</P>
<P>If this could be made out, it would deter not only men of benevolent di&s;po&s;itions, but even men of common humanity, from en|gaging in &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions. For the natu|ral wi&s;h of the truly benevolent is, to cheri&s;h and cultivate, within their own
<PB N="3" REF="5">brea&s;ts, every &s;entiment and feeling of humanity. No con&s;ideration would prevail on them; indeed, what con&s;ideration could prevail on any of the human race, to adopt profe&s;&s;ions, who&s;e natural tendency is to eradicate the feelings of a man, and plant in their bo&s;oms tho&s;e of a demon?</P>
<P>No accu&s;ation of this nature, however, is well founded, again&s;t any branch of the healing art; but what leads the undi&s;cern|ing into mi&s;take on this head is, that, hap|pily for mankind, the habit of &s;eeing ob|jects of di&s;tre&s;s, without dimini&s;hing the &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion in the brea&s;ts of the humane, enables them to pre&s;erve that compo&s;ure and pre&s;ence of mind, which is often nece&s;&s;ary for giving effectual relief; and which, tho&s;e to whom di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ob|jects are le&s;s familiar, are exceedingly apt to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed, if the above accu&s;ation were well founded, it would go to prove, that tho&s;e people in general, whatever their particular profe&s;&s;ions may be, who make it a duty to
<PB N="4" REF="6">vi&s;it pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals, and &s;earch in the cells of poverty for proper objects for the exerci&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion and charity, gradually become hard-hearted; while genuine &s;en&s;ibility dwells only in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who fly from &s;cenes of mi&s;ery, &s;hut their ears again&s;t the cry of angui&s;h, and, at the accidental &s;ight of every object of wretchedne&s;s, &s;how no emotions but tho&s;e of horror and di&s;gu&s;t. This, how|ever, is &s;o contrary to experience, and every ob&s;ervation on the human character, that it is not worth the trouble of a re|futation.</P>
<P>The art of medicine has this advantage over the art of &s;urgery, that the means it u&s;es to accompli&s;h its ends are le&s;s painful; hut &s;urgery, on the other hand, has this &s;uperiority over medicine, that it is more certain.</P>
<P>As the accu&s;ation of cruelty is more di|rectly pointed again&s;t &s;urgery, I &s;hall con|fine my&s;elf, in what I have farther to &s;ay, to that branch of the healing art. Surely
<PB N="5" REF="7">cruelty cannot with ju&s;tice be imputed to an art which pre&s;erves the lives of many; and, by tran&s;ient and temporary pains, &s;aves many more from years of torture.</P>
<P>That &s;ome &s;urgeons are cruel, cannot be denied; and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e all men are not humane. But nothing can be more ab&s;urd than the opinion entertained by &s;ome people, that a certain degree of cruelty is requi&s;ite to enable a man to perform &s;urgi|cal operations with coolne&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind. This is &s;aying, in other words, that to render a man expert in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential acts of humanity, it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be inhumane. No;&mdash;it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be a good anatomi&s;t, and thoroughly ma&s;ter of his bu&s;ine&s;s as a &s;urgeon; it is nece&s;&s;ary that he be convinced the patient has no other chance for life and ea&s;e; and then a man of common &s;teadine&s;s and the greate&s;t humanity will &s;ucce&s;sfully perform every operation of &s;urgery, and continue the practice through life, without any diminu|tion of his humanity.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<P>If in&s;tances are brought of men who are con&s;idered as good &s;urgeons, and yet are of a cruel or unfeeling di&s;po&s;ition, it would be very ea&s;y to prove, that they would be bet|ter &s;urgeons if they were men of humanity. For one aim of &s;urgery being to &s;ave pain, a humane man is much more likely to take every mea&s;ure for this purpo&s;e than a cruel one. All pain that is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for the well-performing the operation, adds to the danger of the patient, for pain alone is one cau&s;e of fever. But it is not only during the operation, but at every pre|vious and &s;ub&s;equent dre&s;&s;ing, that an un|feeling &s;urgeon will be apt to give the pa|tient unnece&s;&s;ary pain, which a &s;urgeon of humanity will always attentively avoid.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the unfeeling &s;urgeon will perform the operation as ea&s;ily and expedi|tiou&s;ly as he can for the &s;ake of his own re|putation; and when he has occa&s;ion to dre&s;s the wound, he will, on the &s;ame ac|count, affect a tenderne&s;s which he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s. But it ought to be remembered,
<PB N="7" REF="9">that people are continually forgetting their a&s;&s;umed, and &s;liding into their natural cha|racters. Nothing therefore can be more certain, than that humanity of di&s;po&s;ition, when joined to knowledge and &s;teadine&s;s, tend to render a &s;urgeon not only more agreeable, but more &s;ucce&s;sful in his prac|tice.</P>
<P>As &s;urgery is in reality one of the mo&s;t humane, &s;o, from its nature, it mu&s;t have been one of the mo&s;t ancient of the arts. The art of curing internal and external di&s;|ea&s;es was exerci&s;ed by the &s;ame men in the early ages. The &s;ame benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition prompted to the one and the other. But it is natural to think, that, from the temperance of mankind in tho&s;e times, they would have few internal di&s;ea&s;es, while the cultivation of the earth, and other nece&s;&s;ary labours mu&s;t have expo&s;ed them to external injuries. The&s;e la&s;t being vi&s;ible, would na|turally attract their attention &s;ooner, and make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on their minds, than hidden di&s;ea&s;es could do.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>It is probable, therefore, that &s;urgery is the mo&s;t ancient of the two branches of the healing art. When a brui&s;e or hurt of any kind was received, the pain would directly excite the &s;ufferer to movements and con|tortions of the injured part; but he would &s;oon perceive that this augmented his an|gui&s;h; and the fir&s;t di&s;covery in &s;urgery probably was, that it is proper to keep a wounded limb quiet and without motion.</P>
<P>It would be ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that cold increa&s;ed the pain of a wound or brui&s;e, which would &s;ugge&s;t the idea of covering them. The fir&s;t coverings would probably be the leaves of herbs and plants. When the&s;e became hard and unea&s;y, they would be removed, and fre&s;h ones applied. In the cour&s;e of which treatment it would fre|quently happen, that the injured part would recover, and the leaves would get the credit of the cure. In this manner various plants, which contribute nothing to the healing of wounds, got the name of vulneraries, and afterwards became ingredients in pla&s;ters and ointments,</P>
<PB N="9" REF="11">
<P>Thus it &s;eems probable, that the earlie&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">fforts of &s;urgery had no object beyond that of palliating or relieving pain. But, as the art improved, and new di&s;ea&s;es occurred, cures of the greate&s;t importance were under|taken. Plants of all kinds were tried, and the whole vegetable kingdom ran&s;acked for external applications that would ea&s;e pain, and heal wounds.</P>
<P>But when fighting and war began, many ca&s;es mu&s;t have occurred, in which the ap|plications of herbs could not give relief. Other aids mu&s;t then have been invented, particularly cutting in&s;truments; for with|out them, what excruciating pain mu&s;t have been endured before a forked-arrow could be extracted from the fle&s;h! with what facility can it be removed, by enlarging the wound with a cutting in&s;trument! The very enlargement of the wound mu&s;t have been remarked in many ca&s;es to have ha&s;ten|ed the cure, which would give the fir&s;t hint for the &s;ame practice in &s;inu&s;es and other ca&s;es, although no dart or arrow was to be cut out.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>The &s;peedy relief given, and the acute pain &s;aved to the wounded by &s;uch means, would of cour&s;e prompt men to invent new in&s;truments of different forms, adapted to the relief of that variety of accidents and di&s;orders to which they are expo&s;ed. When the danger was great and immediate, &s;ome means very painful in the application were adopted. We know that not only cutting, in&s;truments, but even the actual cautery, was u&s;ed in &s;urgery in the days of Hip|pocrates&mdash;and continued to a very late pe|riod, as the only means of &s;topping violent haemorrhages, and removing &s;ome very ob|&s;tinate complaints; but the di&s;covery of the circulation of the blood, and a ju&s;ter no|tion of di&s;ea&s;es, have long &s;ince introduced le&s;s painful methods of &s;topping bleedings, and relieving tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. Nothing le&s;s than to &s;ave the patient from immediate death, or to relieve him from exce&s;&s;ive and durable pain, could ju&s;tify the having re|cour&s;e to &s;o &s;evere a cure as the cautery; and it is to the honour of &s;urgery to have thrown it a&s;ide, as &s;oon as an ea&s;ier one
<PB N="11" REF="13">was invented. The actual cautery is now never employed but to occa&s;ion the exfolia|tion of di&s;ea&s;ed bones, where there is no &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The &s;ame de&s;ire of &s;aving pain to their patients has induced modern &s;urgeons to re|ject the u&s;e of the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, which formerly were much u&s;ed for the opening of &s;inu&s;es, and performing other operations. In tho&s;e days, the opportunities of &s;tudying anatomy were few, and an accurate knowledge of that &s;cience was by no means univer&s;al among practitioners. Con&s;cious of this deficiency, they very naturally were afraid of u&s;ing the &s;calpel, le&s;t they &s;hould divide &s;ome large artery, or injure &s;ome nerve or tendon. The feelings of the patient therefore were &s;acri|ficed to his &s;afety, and an in&s;trument that brui&s;es as well as cuts was preferred, be|cau&s;e it only touches tho&s;e parts which are contained between the blades.</P>
<P>But of late years anatomy has been culti|vated &s;o diligently all over Europe, and has
<PB N="12" REF="14">been taught in this i&s;land in particular with &s;uch accuracy, that the &s;ci&s;&s;ars are entirely left off by &s;urgeons, except in the operation for the hare lip; and the bi&s;tory or &s;calpel, in|&s;truments which give much le&s;s pain, and in &s;kilful hands are equally &s;afe, have been univer&s;ally adopted in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>In performing the operation for the &s;tone, &s;ome &s;urgeons formerly u&s;ed dilating in|&s;truments, which, though they greatly aug|mented the pain, were thought to dimini&s;h the danger. Male and female conductors, and other in&s;truments, intended to render this operation le&s;s dangerous, were al&s;o at different periods introduced; but in this i&s;land they have all been &s;uper&s;eded in fa|vour of Sir Cae&s;ar Hawkins's admirable in|vention of the cutting gorget, which unites ea&s;e with &s;afety.</P>
<P>But after every improvement that can be made on the in&s;truments of &s;urgery, and on the manner of operating, &s;till a great de|gree of pain attends that divi&s;ion or exten|&s;ion
<PB N="13" REF="15">of the fibres of the human body, which is requi&s;ite in &s;urgical operations. An ob|vious means of lulling and dimini&s;hing this was early tried by giving the patient ano|dynes internally, &s;ome time before he un|derwent an operation. Opium is the mo&s;t powerful of this cla&s;s of drugs, and a mo|derate do&s;e is highly expedient to abate the &s;marting of the wound after an operation is over, and to induce &s;leep; but the &s;tronge&s;t do&s;e we dare venture to give, has little or no effect in mitigating the &s;ufferings of the pa|tient during the operation.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential improvements that can be made in &s;urgery are unque&s;tionably tho&s;e which render operations &s;afer, and dimini&s;h the danger of the patient's life. But what can dimini&s;h the acutene&s;s of the pain with|out increa&s;ing the danger, is al&s;o an im|provement very much to be wi&s;hed. Some people &s;ay, what &s;ignifies a few minutes pain;&mdash;but it is not tho&s;e who think them|&s;elves under the immediate nece&s;&s;ity of un|dergoing
<PB N="14" REF="16">a &s;urgical operation who are apt to hold &s;uch language.</P>
<P>The common unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation which is included in the general term of pain, is in|deed of little con&s;equence. But when peo|ple con&s;ider the degree of pain given by &s;ome &s;urgical operations, they mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that to dimini&s;h or prevent a few mi|nutes of <HI>&s;uch</HI> pain, is an object highly de|&s;irable, both to the patient and &s;urgeon. Reflections of this kind &s;truck me very early after I began to &s;tudy my profe&s;&s;ion, and I made various experiments without &s;ucce&s;s, in &s;earch of &s;omething which might miti|gate the violence of the pain in &s;urgical operations. Of late I re&s;umed the &s;ubject, and reflecting on the nature of the nerves, and on &s;ome facts concerning them, I was led to an idea, which I flatter my&s;elf, will go a con&s;iderable way to the accompli&s;hing the object I had in view.</P>
<P>It is known, that the nerves, which ari&s;e from the brain, and are di&s;per&s;ed to all
<PB N="15" REF="17">parts of the body, are the immediate organs of feeling and voluntary motion. For when the trunk of a nerve, who&s;e branches are di&s;per&s;ed to any particular part, is cut or tied, the part to which tho&s;e branches go, immediately lo&s;es feeling and voluntary motion. The fir&s;t thought that occurred to me was, that, to cut the trunk of a nerve going to a limb, might be done with little pain, and enable us to perform the amputation with no pain at all. But a very little reflection convinced me that this was impracticable. For, &s;uppo&s;e the am|putation of the leg, below the knee, is to be performed; cutting the nerves imme|diately above the part where the inci&s;ion is to be made, would not be &s;ufficient; becau&s;e the &s;kin and fle&s;h below the knee, receive &s;en&s;ation from branches thrown off much higher up. To render the in&s;en&s;ibility complete, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to cut the two great nerves at the top of the thigh, &s;oon after they i&s;&s;ue out of the pelvis. But one of them, the crural nerve, runs in contact with the crural artery and vein; and the
<PB N="16" REF="18">other, the &s;ciatic nerve, runs extremely deep among the mu&s;cles, which would render their divi&s;ion at once painful and dangerous.</P>
<P>In an amputation of the arm, the ob|jection to cutting the nerves is &s;till &s;tronger; for the artery below the arm-pit is en|tangled with a plexus of nerves, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to cut without dividing the artery al&s;o.</P>
<P>I then thought my end might po&s;&s;ibly be accompli&s;hed by compre&s;&s;ion; and was en|couraged in this idea, by having often felt that &s;en&s;ation, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, every body has felt &s;ome time or other, when we &s;ay the leg is &s;leeping; and which entirely pro|ceeds from compre&s;&s;ing the &s;ciatic nerve by &s;itting in a particular po&s;ition. In that &s;tate, the leg and foot are numbed, and rendered in &s;ome mea&s;ure in&s;en&s;ible, and, at the &s;ame time, our power of moving them is greatly impaired. It is not till after we have &s;tood up, or varied our po&s;|ture, &s;o as to remove the compre&s;&s;ion for a
<PB N="17" REF="19">con&s;iderable time, that the &s;en&s;ibility and power of motion perfectly return. I re|collected al&s;o the experiment which has been &s;o often made on living animals, of putting a ligature around the nerve going to a particular limb, which renders all the parts below the ligature in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>It occurred to me, at the &s;ame time, that the compre&s;&s;ion of the nerve might be made much more effectually by means of the tourniquet, than by any po&s;ture in which we could po&s;&s;ibly &s;it, and I determined to try the experiment on my&s;elf.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e I placed a compre&s;s di|rectly over the &s;ciatic nerve, ju&s;t as it pa&s;&s;es over the inferior edge of the i&s;chium, fixed it with a bandage acro&s;s the pelvis, between the &s;pine of the ilium and the great trochan|ter, and then applying the tourniquet, I tightened it as much as I could bear. But, to my &s;urpri&s;e, and great mortification, my leg and foot retained their feeling as much as ever.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<P>As it had always &s;eemed evident to me, that the &s;leeping of the foot, as it is termed, was owing to a pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;ciatic nerve, it now appeared unaccountable that the pre&s;&s;ure I had ju&s;t made, did not pro|duce that &s;en&s;ation. It &s;truck me, how|ever, that although I had turned the tour|niquet very hard, yet I might po&s;&s;ibly not have made a &s;ufficiently &s;trong pre&s;&s;ure directly on the &s;ciatic nerve, from my com|pre&s;s being too thin.</P>
<P>I cau&s;ed a thicker and larger compre&s;s to be made, applied it accurately over the nerve as before, and I tightened the tour|niquet &s;o as to make a far &s;tronger pre&s;&s;ure upon the nerve than any which could be made by the weight of the body in &s;itting. But &s;till my limb retained its &s;en&s;ibility, and I felt no &s;en&s;ation like that of the foot's &s;leeping.</P>
<P>I &s;lackened the tourniquet and removed the whole apparatus, a&s;toni&s;hed and per|plexed at an event &s;o little to be ex|pected!</P>
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<P>How did it happen that &s;o &s;trong a compre&s;&s;ion did not produce the &s;ame effect with a ligature?</P>
<P>How did it happen, that it did not at lea&s;t produce a numbne&s;s and &s;leeping in the leg, which a &s;maller pre&s;&s;ure did?</P>
<P>Thinking frequently on this &s;ubject, I recollected that this &s;en&s;ation does not take place <HI>immediately</HI> on the pre&s;&s;ure of the nerve in &s;itting; it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;it for a con&s;iderable time before it is felt. This being the only e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance in which the pre&s;&s;ure made by the compre&s;s and tourniquet, differed from the pre&s;&s;ure by &s;itting, I immediately &s;u&s;pected that the failure of the fir&s;t in producing the &s;ame effect with the &s;econd, depended on this alone; I therefore re&s;olved to renew the experiment, and continue the com|pre&s;&s;ion as long as I thought I could with &s;afety.</P>
<P>I immediately put this re&s;olution in exe|cution. After the compre&s;&s;ion had been
<PB N="20" REF="22">continued about fourteen minutes, I felt a tingling in my toes &s;imilar to what is felt when the foot begins to &s;leep; &s;oon after, my toes grew quite numbed; this numbne&s;s gradually &s;pread up my leg and thigh, and in half an hour, my foot, leg, and the out&s;ide of my thigh, were per|fectly in&s;en&s;ible; &s;o that when I pricked or &s;cratched them with pins, I felt nothing. I al&s;o lo&s;t the power of moving my foot; but although I kept up the compre&s;&s;ion for &s;ome time longer, part of the <HI>in&s;ide</HI> of my thigh and leg &s;till retained &s;ome degree of feeling. I recollected that this mu&s;t be owing to my not having compre&s;&s;ed the crural nerve, which pa&s;&s;es under Paupert's ligament, with the crural artery and vein, and the obturator nerve, which pa&s;&s;es through the obturator ligament.</P>
<P>I &s;lackened the tourniquet, in great hopes that my next experiment would in|tirely an&s;wer my expectations. Sen&s;ation, and the power of motion, gradually re|turned to my limb, a few minutes after I had loo&s;ened the tourniquet.</P>

<P>Being now convinced that to deprive the whole limb of feeling, it would be nece&s;|&s;ary to compre&s;s the crural and obturator nerves, as well as the &s;ciatic, a circum|&s;tance I had neglected in the la&s;t trial, I determined to renew the experiment in that manner. I perceived, however, with &s;ome concern, that this could not be done without compre&s;&s;ing the crural artery and vein likewi&s;e, and con&s;equently &s;topping the circulation of blood in the limb.</P>
<P>But this con&s;ideration did not prevent my making the experiment &s;oon after. I cau&s;ed a bandage to be made with two thick compre&s;&s;es, one of which was placed on the crural and obturator nerves, and the other on the &s;ciatic, at the upper part of the thigh. The tourniquet was applied and tightened. The tingling in my toes, followed by in&s;en&s;ibility and lo&s;s of mo|tion, took place in about the &s;ame time as in the la&s;t experiment. And in half an hour, the in&s;en&s;ibility, which gradually &s;pread it&s;elf upwards, was complete; and I
<PB N="22" REF="24">had not the lea&s;t feeling upon pricking or &s;cratching any part of the limb.</P>
<P>I now &s;ent for Dr. Moore, my father, and for the fir&s;t time informed him of the experiments I had made; he al&s;o tried the effect of pricking my leg with a pin without occa&s;ioning the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; but per|ceiving my leg red and di&s;tended, and being afraid a blood ve&s;&s;el might bur&s;t, he un|loo&s;ened the tourniquet, without allowing it to remain &s;o long as in the la&s;t experi|ment.</P>
<P>There is an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation produced by the compre&s;&s;ion, but how infinitely inferior this is to the pain of amputations, may be conceived from my bearing it ea&s;ily for &s;o long a period. From tho&s;e trials I had lit|tle doubt, but that by effectually compre&s;|&s;ing the nerves for a proper time, the whole, or by far the greate&s;t part of the pain in amputations, and &s;ome other &s;urgical ope|rations, may be &s;aved to the patient.</P>
<P>Repeated experiments have proved, that cutting or tying a nerve going to a part in|&s;tantly
<PB N="23" REF="25">de&s;troys &s;en&s;ation, and voluntary motion in that part. Cutting quite through certainly de&s;troys the texture of the nerve; and I have a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that when the ligature is made &s;o tight as <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> to &s;top &s;en&s;ation in the parts below, tying it in that manner de&s;troys its texture al&s;o.</P>
<P>But compre&s;&s;ion does not injure the nerve &s;o much, as either cutting, or &s;uch tying. And to this circum&s;tance perhaps it is owing that it requires &s;ome time before compre&s;&s;ion produces that degree of in&s;en&s;ibility which is in&s;tantly the effect of the other two me|thods. Be that as it may, it certainly does require a certain time before the in&s;en&s;ibi|lity follows the greate&s;t compre&s;&s;ion. This has never before been ob&s;erved, or applied to the purpo&s;e of preventing the pain in &s;urgical operations.</P>
<P>The idea that a certain fluid, which has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of animal &s;pirits, flows in the nerves, and that it is by the means of this fluid, and its free egre&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="26">and regre&s;s to and from the brain, that mo|tion and &s;en&s;ibility depend, has been adopt|ed by phy&s;iologi&s;ts of the greate&s;t eminence. Yet as this fluid has never been made evi|dent to the &s;en&s;es, but has baffled the re|&s;earches of the mo&s;t dexterous anatomi&s;ts, its exi&s;tence can be con&s;idered as no more than a mere hypothe&s;is, and of cour&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible that no &s;uch fluid does exi&s;t. On the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a fluid, it might na|turally be expected, that upon compre&s;&s;ing the nerves in the manner above de&s;cribed, the numbne&s;s and lo&s;s of voluntary motion of the parts below the compre&s;&s;ion would take place in&s;tantly; whereas, we find, that they happen in a very gradual manner, and are not complete till after a con&s;iderable time. Which &s;eems rather to favour the &s;u&s;picion many entertain, that no &s;uch fluid as the animal &s;pirits does exi&s;t, but that the brain and nerves perform their functions by &s;ome other means, which nobody has ever yet been able to di&s;cover or explain. But however that may be, is of little importance to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; I return therefore to my &s;ubject.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="27">
<P>The fir&s;t notion I had with re&s;pect to the manner of rendering the limb in&s;en&s;ible pre|vious to amputation, was no other than that which I u&s;ed when I made the com|pre&s;&s;ion on my own thigh; to place com|pre&s;&s;es of a proper thickne&s;s upon the &s;ciatic, crural, and obturator nerves, to apply and twi&s;t the tourniquet, and keep it &s;o, till the limb lo&s;es all &s;en&s;ation. But as the total &s;toppage of the circulation for &s;o long a time as is nece&s;&s;ary to render the limb completely in&s;en&s;ible, will be con&s;idered as an objection, I thought of an in&s;trument which will in a great mea&s;ure obviate this, by effectually compre&s;&s;ing the nerves, without entirely &s;topping the circulation of the blood in the limb. I gave directions to Mr. Savigny in Pallmall, for making the in&s;trument, which I find entirely an&s;wers the purpo&s;e intended.</P>
<P>A clear idea of the compre&s;&s;or, and the manner it is to be applied, will be con|ceived from the annexed plate.</P>
<P>Figure I. A, the compre&s;&s;ing in&s;tru|ment, being formed of a curved piece of

<P>C, a &s;crew pa&s;&s;ing through a hole at the other extremity of the in&s;trument, and terminating in D, an oval compre&s;s to be placed on the crural nerve.</P>
<P>When this in&s;trument is to be applied, it will be nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to &s;earch for the &s;ciatic nerve. For this pur|po&s;e, let the operator feel for the tubero&s;ity of the os i&s;chium, and then for the great trochanter, and &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;traight line drawn from the one to the other, apply the compre&s;s B about an inch above the middle of that line.</P>

<P>Figure II. repre&s;ents the in&s;trument ad|ju&s;ted to the thigh. And Figure III. a &s;maller compre&s;&s;or, &s;uited to the arm.</P>
<P>As all the nerves, which give &s;en&s;ation to the arm, form a plexus in the axilla, clo&s;e to the humeral artery, the pul&s;ation of the latter will direct the operator where to place the compre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Although we are under an ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity of compre&s;&s;ing the crural artery along with the nerve, there is not the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of compre&s;&s;ing the crural vein; becau&s;e the latter is the mo&s;t inter|nal of the three. So that, with attention, the compre&s;s may be kept &s;o much towards the out&s;ide of the thigh, as to bear upon the nerve without touching the vein.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="31">
<P>It is evident, that by this in&s;trument the compre&s;&s;ion is confined to two points, which are nearly oppo&s;ite to each other. All the re&s;t of the limb is left free and un|compre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We cannot apprehend any bad con&s;e|quence from the &s;topping the great artery for an hour or two; for we know that, after the operation for the aneuri&s;m in the thigh where the artery is tied, and the cir|culation through it &s;topped for ever, yet the ana&s;tamo&s;ing ve&s;&s;els carry on a circula|tion &s;ufficient for the nouri&s;hment of the limb.</P>
<P>This, however, will render it nece&s;&s;ary, in all amputations where the compre&s;&s;or is adopted, to apply the common tourniquet in the u&s;ual manner. For without this precaution, although the great artery is ob&s;tructed, &s;till the bleeding would be very profu&s;e from the ana&s;tamo&s;ing ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the in&s;trument was made, I tried it on my own thigh. After continuing
<PB N="29" REF="32">the compre&s;&s;ion half an hour, I lo&s;t all &s;en&s;ation and power of motion below the knee; but the thigh retained a con&s;iderable degree of feeling. This is owing to &s;ome branches of the lumbar nerves, to the ob|turator nerve, and branches which the &s;ciatic and crural &s;end off before they de&s;cend to the thigh, not being com|pre&s;&s;ed by this in&s;trument. From which it is evident, that the compre&s;&s;or will not be able to dimini&s;h the pain in amputations above the knee, in &s;uch a degree as be|low.</P>
<P>I &s;poke on the &s;ubject to &s;ome gentle|men of the faculty, who &s;eemed equally plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed at the effect of the experiments I had made, and thought they ought to be publi&s;hed, as the &s;peedie&s;t way of a&s;certaining &s;o intere&s;ting a fact.</P>
<P>Being perfectly convinced my&s;elf that the pain of many operations in &s;urgery would be prevented, or at lea&s;t dimini&s;hed, by the means I propo&s;ed; I was &s;ufficiently inclined not to delay their publication.
<PB N="30" REF="33">Yet, as my experiments had been of &s;o confined a nature, I wi&s;hed that the com|pre&s;&s;or might be tried in &s;ome &s;evere operation, previous to their being made public.</P>
<P>I communicated the experiments I had made, and all my ideas on the &s;ubject, to Mr. Hunter, who was &s;o obliging as im|mediately to offer me an opportunity of trying the effect of my compre&s;&s;or at St. George's Ho&s;pital, on a man who&s;e leg he was to take off below the knee within a few days.</P>
<P>I went to the ho&s;pital the day before the operation to try the in&s;trument. The pa|tient had lo&s;t all his toes, and had a large ulcer on his foot. This was &s;o much inflamed, and &s;o irritable, that dre&s;&s;|ing it in the gentle&s;t manner gave him acute pain.</P>
<P>I applied the in&s;trument; after the com|pre&s;&s;ion had been continued for about half
<PB N="31" REF="34">an hour, his limb became &s;o in&s;en&s;ible that rubbing pretty &s;martly with the finger upon the ulcer gave no pain.</P>
<P>Next morning the patient being carried to the operation room, I began the com|pre&s;&s;ion of the nerves at a quarter before eleven o'clock. The numbne&s;s of the limb followed at the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>At a quarter before twelve, I gave him one grain of opium, to dimini&s;h the &s;mart|ing of the wound after the operation, when the compre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be taken off. A few minutes after twelve, the tourniquet was applied, and the amputation performed by Mr. Hunter, at the u&s;ual place below the knee.</P>
<P>At the circular inci&s;ion through the &s;kin, the patient did not cry out, change a mu&s;cle of his face, or &s;hew any &s;ymptom of pain. At the &s;ub&s;equent parts of the operation, particularly during the &s;awing of the bones, he &s;hewed marks of unea&s;ine&s;s in his coun|tenance, but did not cry out.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="35">
<P>As it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to take up no le&s;s than five arteries, the operation la&s;ted a longer time than is u&s;ual, and to|wards the end he grew fainti&s;h, and de&s;ired to have &s;ome water, and afterwards a&s;ked if they were nearly done.</P>
<P>When the operation &s;eemed to be over, and the bleeding &s;topt, the tourniquet was relaxed, and I al&s;o removed the compre&s;&s;or. But a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el bleeding unexpectedly, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to tie it al&s;o. Here the patient &s;hewed very &s;trong marks of pain, and afterwards declared, the tying this la&s;t ve&s;&s;el gave him much more pain than all the others, although the great nerves had been included in the ligatures.</P>
<P>When he was put to bed, the wound &s;marted, as is u&s;ual after amputations. The compre&s;&s;or being now entirely removed, this was to be expected. But &s;ome time after being que&s;tioned concerning the pain he had &s;uffered during the operation, he declared that he had felt hardly any, except as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed it, at the ra&s;ping
<PB N="33" REF="36">of the bones, which he added had &s;haken his whole limb. This &s;eems a little ex|traordinary, as &s;awing the bones is u&s;ually the lea&s;t painful part of amputations.</P>
<P>Although I expected that the ana&s;tamo|&s;ing ve&s;&s;els would carry on a certain degree of circulation notwith&s;tanding the ob&s;truc|tion of the great trunk, yet I had no idea that it would have been &s;o &s;trong as it was; for, on &s;lackening the tourniquet, the arteries bled per &s;altum, though the compre&s;&s;ing in|&s;trument remained in full force on the cru|ral artery.</P>
<P>This trial had all the &s;ucce&s;s I expected; there was evidently a mo&s;t remarkable di|minution of pain, particularly during the fir&s;t inci&s;ions through the &s;kin and mu&s;cles, which are generally by far the mo&s;t &s;evere parts of the operation. And I am convinced that what pain the patient felt, was chiefly owing to &s;ome &s;mall branches of the lum|bar nerves which extend below the knee, and were not compre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="37">
<P>I gave directions for a &s;maller compre&s;&s;or to be made for the arm. The in&s;trument may be applied with greater facility, and will probably have a more complete effect in preventing pain in amputations and other operations of this member than in tho&s;e of the thigh and leg, becau&s;e all the nerves which convey &s;en&s;ation to the arm and hand, lie together in the axilla. The in&s;tru|ment therefore being applied as in Figure III. will compre&s;s the whole plexus at once.</P>
<P>The artery, indeed, which is &s;urrounded with this plexus of nerves will be compre&s;&s;ed al&s;o. But the circulation here, as in the leg, will be &s;ufficiently carried on by the ana&s;tamo&s;ing ve&s;&s;els. I tried the &s;maller compre&s;&s;or on my own arm, and the in&s;en|&s;ibility followed in rather a &s;horter time than happens in compre&s;&s;ing the nerves of the thigh.</P>
<P>In amputations where the compre&s;&s;or is u&s;ed, it will be proper to apply it at lea&s;t an hour and an half before the operation. The unea&s;ine&s;s which this occa&s;ions is &s;o &s;mall as hardly to de&s;erve mention.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="38">
<P>It was thought by &s;ome of the gentlemen to whom I communicated my ideas on this &s;ubject, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to loo&s;en the compre&s;&s;or after the limb is taken off, and, previous to the tying of the ve&s;&s;els, that the &s;urgeon might the more di&s;tinctly &s;ee tho&s;e that need to be tied; by which means &s;en&s;ation would return to the parts, and of cour&s;e there would be the u&s;ual pain in tying the ve&s;&s;els. But a &s;urgeon, who is an ana|tomi&s;t, ea&s;ily finds the great arteries without even the tourniquet's being &s;lackened, which is nece&s;&s;ary only for di&s;covering the &s;maller arteries, and the free manner in which they bled as &s;oon as the tourniquet was &s;lacken|ed in the operation above de&s;cribed, ob|viates this objection, by proving, that there is no nece&s;&s;ity for removing the compre&s;&s;ion of the nerves, till every part of the opera|tion is fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>It has already been ob&s;erved, that the compre&s;&s;or for the thigh acts only upon the &s;ciatic and crural nerves, and can have no effect upon tho&s;e branches of the lumbar nerves, which come off from within the pelvis, &s;ome of which de&s;cend below the
<PB N="36" REF="39">knee. But perhaps, applying the common tourniquet, and keeping it tight for a quar|ter of an hour, or twenty minutes, before the operation, would &s;upply this defect, and blunt, in &s;ome degree, the &s;en&s;ibility tho&s;e branches produce in amputations immedi|ately below the knee. This, however, is an object of little importance, as when the great trunks of the &s;ciatic and crural nerves have been duly compre&s;&s;ed for a proper time, the degree of &s;en&s;ibility which the twigs above|mentioned convey, cannot be great.</P>
<P>On removing the compre&s;&s;or after am|putations, the patient will no doubt be ex|po&s;ed to the &s;ame degree of &s;marting from the wound, that is u&s;ual when the operation has been performed in the common way. All I originally expected from the compre&s;|&s;ing in&s;trument was, a prevention or great diminution of pain during operations. But I have &s;ince entertained a notion, that even the &s;marting of the wound after amputa|tions of the leg would be greatly le&s;&s;ened, by applying the termination of the com|pre&s;&s;or B<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Fig. I. of the Plate.</NOTE> upon the &s;ciatic nerve, and mak|ing
<PB N="37" REF="40">the oval compre&s;s D bear on &s;ome other part than that where the crural artery vein and nerve are; by which means the circu|lation of the blood through the leg and thigh will not be impeded, yet the &s;ciatic nerve will be &s;o compre&s;&s;ed as may reduce the &s;marting to a &s;en&s;ation ea&s;ily to be en|dured. But, as I have made no experiment to a&s;certain this, I hazard it merely as a conjecture.</P>
<P>It may be urged, that compre&s;&s;ing the large trunks of nerves, and thereby ob&s;truct|ing the nervous influence for &s;o long a time, may leave a numbne&s;s, or &s;ome paralytic weakne&s;s in that part of the limb which re|mains. I cannot think, however, that there is the lea&s;t danger of any &s;uch con&s;equence. I have frequently kept the compre&s;&s;or upon my own limbs for a con&s;iderable time after all &s;en&s;ibility and power of motion was gone; and a few minutes after removing it, both returned as entirely as before. The &s;ame has taken place with re&s;pect to the pa|tient at St. George's ho&s;pital, who&s;e leg was amputated.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="41">
<P>When by a blow on the head, part of the &s;kull is beat down and pre&s;&s;es on the brain; or when from the &s;ame, or any other accident, extrava&s;ated blood is lodged between the &s;kull and brain, and pre&s;&s;es upon the latter &s;o as to occa&s;ion a &s;tupor and in&s;en&s;ibility; though the pre&s;&s;ure here is not made on one nerve, but on the origin of <HI>all</HI> the nerves, &s;o as to produce <HI>univer&s;al</HI> in&s;en&s;ibility; yet, as &s;oon as the depre&s;&s;ion is removed, or the extrava&s;ation evacuated, or ab&s;orbed, &s;en&s;ation returns. This is what every &s;urgeon mu&s;t have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee frequently. But I am per&s;waded that, in a &s;hort time, experience will prove better than any rea&s;oning <HI>a priori,</HI> or from analogy, that this objection has no weight.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to ob&s;erve, that all the nerves which go to the thigh, that cannot be compre&s;&s;ed by the in&s;trument, are,</P>

</LIST>
<P>From this account it is evident, that the compre&s;&s;ing in&s;trument cannot dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;ation in the thigh in &s;uch a com|plete manner as in the leg.</P>
<P>In amputations above the knee, there|fore, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e the com|mon tourniquet in the following man|ner:</P>
<P>Two thick compre&s;&s;es are to be placed upon the great nerves, immediately above where the bone is to be &s;awed. Then the tourniquet mu&s;t be applied over them, tightened, and kept in that &s;ituation till the thigh becomes in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43">
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, before the trial is made, what length of time it will require to render the in&s;en&s;ibility complete; but I imagine that, after an hour, very little pain will be &s;uffered from the operation. When the veins become turgid, it will perhaps be right to open one with a lancet, le&s;t any of them &s;hould bur&s;t. No danger need be apprehended from the lo&s;s of blood this will occa&s;ion; becau&s;e the tourniquet will prevent any from flowing, that would not at any rate have been lo&s;t on the fir&s;t in|ci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The circulation is never entirely &s;topt by the tourniquet, &s;o that there will be no danger of any bad con&s;equence, from its being continued tight the time nece&s;&s;ary for preventing, or greatly dimini&s;hing, the pain of the operation. Whatever hap|pens to the part of the limb that is to be cut off, is of no con&s;equence.</P>
<P>As the keeping the tourniquet tight upon the thigh for &s;o long a time, though at|tended with no danger, mu&s;t give more
<PB N="41" REF="44">unea&s;ine&s;s than the compre&s;&s;or; it is to be regretted that the in&s;en&s;ibility cannot be entirely accompli&s;hed by the la&s;t in&s;trument as at pre&s;ent con&s;tructed. A more com|modious and effectual method may pro|bably occur to &s;ome other per&s;on; and particular improvements will, no doubt, be adapted to particular ca&s;es. Mean while, all the inconveniences ari&s;ing from the u&s;e of the tourniquet as a compre&s;&s;or in the manner above de&s;cribed, will be more than compen&s;ated by the abatement of pain it will produce.</P>
<P>The &s;tronge&s;t objection made to the in|genious manner of amputating limbs, invented by Mr. Allan&s;on of Liverpool, is, that it takes up longer time than the com|mon method, and of cour&s;e keeps the pa|tient longer in torment. The improve|ment I have propo&s;ed will, particularly in amputations below the knee, and in the arm, remove the whole &s;pirit of this objection, and the full benefit of that gentleman's invention will be enjoyed without inconveniency.</P>

<P>A particular treatment, like that u&s;ed at Paris, might po&s;&s;ibly favour the union by the fir&s;t intention.</P>
<P>Previous to Lithotomy, amputations, and all &s;urgical operations of importance, except &s;uch as from the nature of the ca&s;e require to be performed in&s;tantly, or where the per&s;on is already much weakened, it is the practice at Paris, and, I believe, all over France, to make the patient undergo what is called a preparatory cour&s;e; which is proportioned to the per&s;on's &s;trength, and the &s;everity of the operation to be per|formed, and generally la&s;ts ten days or a fortnight.</P>
<P>If the patient is of a plethoric habit, he is blooded; the re&s;t of the cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of a few do&s;es of gentle purgatives, a warm bath every &s;econd or third day, and a low cooling regimen.</P>

<P>But preventing pain in amputations, is not the only benefit which will ari&s;e from compre&s;&s;ing the nerves. I flatter my&s;elf, many other advantages will attend it. By deadening the &s;en&s;ibility of the parts to be operated upon, the &s;urgeon will be enabled to examine bones that are &s;u&s;pected to be carious, to u&s;e the means nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce exfoliations, to lay open ab&s;ce&s;&s;es and &s;inu&s;es, to remove &s;plinters and other extraneous &s;ub&s;tances from wounds and ulcers, and of cour&s;e cure them with more certainty and expedition than formerly.
<PB N="44" REF="47">For the patient being enabled to bear the probing, enlarging, and every requi&s;ite mode of examination with more tranquil|lity, the &s;urgeon of cour&s;e mu&s;t acquire a more certain and exten&s;ive knowledge of the nature of each ca&s;e, than when his in|ve&s;tigations are di&s;turbed by the cries and contortions of the &s;ufferer; and therefore we may rea&s;onably hope, that not only pain, but even limbs and lives may &s;ome|times be &s;aved.</P>
<P>The reduction of fractures and di&s;lo|cations will al&s;o be rendered more ea&s;y to the &s;urgeon as well as the patient. For although the mu&s;cles, when irritated by exten&s;ion or otherwi&s;e, may &s;till contract a little, yet the compre&s;&s;ion of the nerves will prevent the patient's having either the power or inclination to re&s;i&s;t the efforts of the operator, for re&s;toring the parts to their natural &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The dreadful idea many people have, of the pain attending &s;urgical operations, has often of it&s;elf the very wor&s;t effects.
<PB N="45" REF="48">The previous knowledge, therefore, that by this method his pain will be greatly mi|tigated, will contribute to prevent all that agitation of mind and feveri&s;hne&s;s which &s;o violent an impre&s;&s;ion occa&s;ions; and of cour&s;e render every &s;urgical operation, in which compre&s;&s;ion of the nerves can be u&s;ed, le&s;s dangerous.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible, but that the locked jaw, when that dreadful &s;ymptom ari&s;es from a wound in any of the extremities, may be cured by compre&s;&s;ing the nerve between the injured part and the brain.</P>
<P>Some people may imagine, that I ought to have delayed this publication till the ef|fects of compre&s;&s;ing the nerves could be fully a&s;certained, by a number and variety of experiments; but it is principally be|cau&s;e I think a number and variety of experiments nece&s;&s;ary, that I have ventured to lay all my ideas on the &s;ubject, crude as they are, before the Public, without any farther delay; in which I am confirmed by what has happened &s;ince the operation.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="49">
<P>It cannot be imagined, that I con&s;ider the few experiments I have had it in my power to make, or the &s;ingle trial at St. George's ho&s;pital, as deci&s;ive; but I flatter my&s;elf they are &s;ufficient to excite a very thorough inve&s;tigation; and I am convinced, that whatever farther trials I or my friends could make, would be objected to, as le&s;s &s;atisfactory, than tho&s;e which will be made by impartial men of the profe&s;&s;ion all over the kingdom.</P>
<P>I have therefore related what fir&s;t led me to the idea that pain would be prevented or dimini&s;hed by a continued compre&s;&s;ion of the nerves; I have &s;tated the experiments I made on my&s;elf, and their effects; all I can know at this moment with certainty is, that compre&s;&s;ion deprived my own limbs, in a very great degree, of &s;en&s;ibility and mo|tion, without leaving any inconveniency after the compre&s;&s;ion was removed.</P>
<P>From this I concluded, that it would greatly dimini&s;h, if not intirely pre|vent, the pain in &s;everal &s;urgical opera|tions;
<PB N="47" REF="50">but to what degree this conclu&s;ion is ju&s;t, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly know with equal certainty. I could only relate the patient's behaviour and a&s;&s;ertions who underwent amputation at St. George's ho&s;pital, leaving to every one to give what weight to tho&s;e he plea&s;es. My own full conviction is, that the compre&s;&s;ion of the nerves in this ca&s;e produced a very great diminution of the pain he would otherwi&s;e have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Whether by keeping the compre&s;&s;or tight for a longer &s;pace of time, or by the addi|tional aid of the tourniquet, the pain in &s;uch &s;evere operations can be entirely pre|vented, or to what degree it may be di|mini&s;hed, will require various trials and accurate inve&s;tigation to a&s;certain; for this may vary in different operations, and perhaps in different con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Some people po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch firmne&s;s of mind, as to de&s;pi&s;e a con&s;iderable degree of pain, and call it nothing; others are of &s;o delicate and timid a nature, as to cry out with a moderate unea&s;ine&s;s; and there are
<PB N="48" REF="51">who could not refrain from crying at the &s;ight or touch of a &s;urgical in&s;tru|ment, although there was no pain at all. An operator may, on a particular occa|&s;ion, not place the compre&s;s exactly on the nerves, or may not keep up the pre&s;&s;ure the proper time. From tho&s;e, and other cir|cum&s;tances, there may be different accounts, at fir&s;t, of the effects of the method I have propo&s;ed, but the truth will be fully known at la&s;t; and no plan that might have been followed, could have a&s;certained it &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o unexceptionably, as that I have taken.</P>
<P>I already mentioned, that I was advi&s;ed to give the patient at the ho&s;pital a grain of opium, with a view to mitigate the &s;marting after the operation, and promote &s;leep. This practice, I believe, is not un|common; I have always thought it had a good effect; and therefore am of opinion, it ought to be ob&s;erved, previous to every &s;evere operation.</P>
<P>A gentleman of candour and integrity, eminent in his profe&s;&s;ion, and who honours
<PB N="49" REF="52">me with his friend&s;hip, &s;ometime after the operation, informed me, that this cir|cum&s;tance has been laid hold of, and I have &s;ince learnt from others, that very uncandid con&s;tructions have been put upon it. This might have given me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, if the malice of tho&s;e in&s;inuations were not entirely defeated by their ab&s;urdity. Tho&s;e who&s;e under&s;tandings allow them to believe that a grain of opium could dimini&s;h the pain of cutting off a limb, will hardly be convinced of the contrary by <HI>rea&s;oning.</HI> All I &s;hall &s;ay to &s;uch people is, that if I have di&s;covered that a grain of opium has &s;o great an effect, they mu&s;t at lea&s;t allow me the merit of being the fir&s;t di&s;coverer.</P>
<P>But every body of common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t &s;ee, that the method I have &s;ubmitted to the Public, does not admit of impo&s;ition; its real merit or futility mu&s;t be known; it will not long be in the power of detraction to &s;tifle the one, nor of friend&s;hip to con|ceal the other.</P>
<P>To attempt impo&s;ition, and at the &s;ame time to publi&s;h the means of detection,
<PB N="50" REF="53">would be a degree of folly without ex|ample; but without &s;uch ab&s;urdity, a man may wi&s;h to publi&s;h what he believes will be of public utility, and may think, that even the probability of &s;aving &s;evere tor|ture to &s;ome of his fellow-creatures, a &s;tronger rea&s;on for doing &s;o immediately, than the ri&s;k of offering a defective per|formance to the Public is for delaying it.</P>
