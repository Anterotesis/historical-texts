<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the following Tract, I have endea|voured to comprize the Sum of what has been hitherto publi&s;hed, on this curious and important Subject, by Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hoadly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on, Wat&s;on, Lovett, Freke, Martin, Watkins,</HI> and in the <HI>Monthly Maga|zines.</HI> But I am chiefly indebted to Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> for the &s;peculative Part, and to Mr. <HI>Lovett,</HI> for the practical: Tho' I cannot in every Thing &s;ub&s;cribe to the Sentiments ei|ther of one or the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. Indeed I am not greatly concerned for the philo&s;ophical Part, whether it &s;tand or fall. Of the Facts we are ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ured: Altho' they are of &s;o &s;urprizing a nature, than a man could not have a&s;&s;erted them a few Years ago, without quite giving up his Reputation. But who can be a&s;&s;ured of this or that Hypothe&s;is, by which he endeavours to account for tho&s;e Facts? Perhaps the ut|mo&s;t we have rea&s;on to expect here, is an high Degree of Probability.</P>
<P N="3">3. I am much more concerned for the phy&s;ical Part, knowing of how great Im|portance this is: How much Sickne&s;s and
<PB N="iv" REF="3">Pain may be prevented or removed, and how many Lives &s;aved by this unparallel'd Reme|dy. And yet with what Vehemence has it been oppo&s;ed? Sometimes by treating it with Contempt, as if it were of little or no U&s;e: Sometimes by Arguments, &s;uch as they were; and &s;ometimes by &s;uch Cautions again&s;t it's ill Effects, as made thou&s;ands afraid to meddle with it.</P>
<P N="4">4. But &s;o it has fared with almo&s;t all the &s;imple Remedies, which have been offered to the World for many Years. When Sir <HI>John Floyer</HI> publi&s;hed his excellent Book on <HI>Cold bathing,</HI> many for a Time u&s;ed and pro|fited by it. So did abundance of People by <HI>Cold Water,</HI> when it was publickly recom|mended by Dr. <HI>Hancock.</HI> The ingenious and benevolent Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> brought <HI>Tar-Water</HI> likewi&s;e into Credit for a Sea&s;on; and innumerable were the Cures wrought there|by, even in the mo&s;t de&s;perate and deplor|able Ca&s;es. Nor was it a little Good which was done by the U&s;e of <HI>Sea-Water,</HI> after Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had publi&s;hed his Tract concerning it. Indeed each of the&s;e did Wonders in it's turn. But alas! their Reign was &s;hort. The va&s;t Party which were on the other Side, &s;oon rai&s;ed the Cry, and ran them down. In a few Years they were out of Fa&s;hion, cut of U&s;e, and almo&s;t out of Memory: And the foul; hard named <HI>Exotics</HI> took Place again, to the utter Confu&s;ion of Common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. Mu&s;t not <HI>Electricity</HI> then, whatever Wonders it may now perform, expect &s;oon
<PB N="v" REF="4">to &s;hare the &s;ame Fate? And yet it is ab&s;o|lutely certain, that in many, very many Ca&s;es, it &s;eldom or never fails. "I can truly &s;ay, (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Lovett</HI>) I &s;carce ever knew any who made the Trial and did not &s;ucceed. Not that all Di&s;orders will yield thereto. Neither in this any more than the common Way, will the &s;ame Treatment of the &s;ame Di&s;order in different Per&s;ons have always the &s;ame Succe&s;s." Indeed there can|not be in Nature any &s;uch Thing as an ab&s;o|lute <HI>Panacea:</HI> A Medicine that will cure every Di&s;ea&s;e incident to the human Body. If there could, Electricity would bid fairer for it, than any Thing in the World: As it takes Place in &s;uch a va&s;t Number of Di&s;|orders, &s;ome of them &s;o widely different from the others.</P>
<P N="6">6. And yet there is &s;omething peculiarly unaccountable, with regard to its Operation. In &s;ome Ca&s;es, where there was no Hope of Help, it will &s;ucceed beyond all Expec|tation. In others, where we had the greate&s;t Hope, it will have no Effect at all. Again, in &s;ome Experiments, it helps at the very fir&s;t, and promi&s;es a &s;peedy Cure: But pre|&s;ently the good Effect cea&s;es, and the Pa|tient is as he was before. On the contrary, in others it has no Effect at fir&s;t: It does no good; perhaps &s;eems to do hurt. Yet all this Time it is &s;triking at the Root of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which in a while it totally removes. Frequent In&s;tances of the former we have in <HI>Para&s;lytic,</HI> of the latter, in <HI>Rheumatic</HI> Ca&s;es.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
<P N="7">7. But &s;till one may upon the whole pro|nounce it the <HI>De&s;ideratum,</HI> the general and rarely failing Remedy, in nervous Ca&s;es of every Kind (Pal&s;ies excepted); as well as in many others. Perhaps if the Nerves are really perforated (as is now generally &s;up|po&s;ed) the Electric Ether is the only Fluid in the Univer&s;e, which is fine enough to move through them. And what if the <HI>Nervous Juice</HI> it&s;elf, be a Fluid of this Kind? If &s;o, it is no Wonder that it has always eluded the Search of the mo&s;t accurate Naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P N="8">8. Be this as it may, Mr. <HI>Lovett</HI> is of Opinion, "the electrical Method of treating Di&s;orders, cannot be expected to arrive at any con&s;iderable Degree of Perfection, till admini&s;ter'd and applied by the Gentlemen of the Faculty." Nay then, <HI>quant&acirc; de &s;pe de|cidi!</HI> All my Hopes are at an End. For when will it be admini&s;tered and applied by them? Truly, <HI>ad Graecas Calendas.</HI> Not till the Gentlemen of the Faculty have more re|gard to the Intere&s;t of their Neighbours than their own. At lea&s;t, not till there are no Apothecaries in the Land: Or till Phy&s;ici|ans are independent of them.</P>
<P N="9">9. Therefore without waiting for what probably never will be, and what indeed we have no Rea&s;on to expect, let Men of Sen&s;e do the be&s;t they can for them&s;elves, as well as for their poor, &s;ick, helple&s;s Neighbours. How many may they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lieve from racking Pain or pining Sickne&s;s, by this unexpen&s;ive and &s;peedy Remedy? Re&s;toring them&punc; to
<PB N="vii" REF="6">Ea&s;e, Health, Strength, generally in a few Minutes, frequently in a Moment! And if a few of the&s;e Lovers of Mankind, who have &s;ome little Knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy, would only be diligent in mak|ing Experiments, and &s;etting down the more remarkable of them, in order to communi|cate them to one another, that each might profit by the other's Labour: I doubt not, but more nervous Di&s;orders would be cured in one Year, by this &s;ingle Remedy, than the whole <HI>Engli&s;h Materia Medica</HI> will cure, by the End of the Century.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, but the <HI>Gentlemen Reviewers</HI> may be&s;tow a Compliment on me as well as on Mr. <HI>Lovett.</HI> If they are &s;o kind, I would only beg them, not to plume them&s;elves upon a Di&s;covery, which I have helped them to my&s;elf: Namely, that the following is little more than an Extract from others: I intended it &s;o to be. I de&s;igned only to collect together the Sub&s;tance of the mo&s;t celebrated Writings on the Subject; and to place them in one connected View, for the U&s;e of tho&s;e who have little Time or Money to &s;pare. I only wi&s;h, &s;ome who has more Lei&s;ure and Ability than me, would con&s;ider it more deeply, and write a full Practical Treati&s;e on Electricity, which might be a Ble&s;&s;ing to Many Generations.</P>

<HEAD>THE DESIDERATUM: OR ELECTRICITY made PLAIN.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. 1. FROM a thou&s;and Experiments it ap|pears, that there is a fluid far more &s;ubtle than Air, which is every where diffu&s;ed thro' all Space, which &s;urrounds the Earth and pervades every Part of it. And &s;uch is the extreme Fine|ne&s;s, Velocity and Expan&s;ivene&s;s of this active Principle, that all other Matter &s;eems to be only the Body, and this the Soul of the Univer&s;e. This we might term <HI>Elementary Fire;</HI> but that it is hard for us to &s;eparate the Ideas of <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Burning:</HI> Altho' the latter is in reality but a preternatural and violent Effect of the former.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is highly probable this is the general In&s;tru|ment of all the Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ion in the Univer&s;e: From this <HI>pure Fire,</HI> (which is properly &s;o called) the vulgar <HI>Culinary</HI> Fire is kindled. For in Truth there is but one Kind of Fire in Nature, which exi&s;ts in all Places and in all Bodies. And this is &s;ubtle and active enough, not only to be, under the Great Cau&s;e, the &s;econdary Cau&s;e of Motion, but to pro|duce and &s;u&s;tain Life thro'out all Nature, as well in Animals as in Vegetables.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P N="3">3. To this effect the learned Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cloyne</HI> ob&s;erves, "The vital Flame is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Cau&s;e of all the Motions in the Body of Man, whether natural or voluntary. And has not Fire the &s;ame Force to animate thro'out, and actuate the whole Sy&s;tem of the World? Cheri&s;hing, heat|ing, fermenting, di&s;&s;olving, &s;hining, and operating in various Manners, as various Subjects offer, to employ, or to determine it's Force? It is pre|&s;ent in all Parts of the Earth and Firmament, tho' latent and unob&s;erved, till &s;ome Accident produces it into Act, and renders it vi&s;ible in it's Effects."</P>
<P N="4">4. This great Machine of the World requires &s;ome &s;uch con&s;tant, active and powerful Principle, con&s;tituted by it's Creator, to keep the heavenly Bodies in their &s;everal Cour&s;es, and at the &s;ame Time give Support, Life and Increa&s;e to the vari|ous Inhabitants of the Earth. Now as the Heart of every Animal is the Engine which circulates the Blood thro' the whole Body, &s;o the Sun, as the Heart of the World, circulates this Fire thro' the whole Univer&s;e. And this Element is not capable of any e&s;&s;ential Alteration, Increa&s;e or Diminution. It is a Species by it&s;elf; and is of a Nature totally di&s;tinct from that of all other Bodies.</P>
<P N="5">5. That this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary both to feed common Fire, and to &s;u&s;tain the Life of Ani|mals, it &s;eems may be learn'd from an ea&s;y Experi|ment. Place a Cat, together with a lighted Candle, in a cold Oven: Then lute the Door clo&s;e, having fixt a Gla&s;s in the Middle of it: And if you look thro' this, you may ob&s;erve, at one and the &s;ame In&s;tant, the Candle goes out, and the Animal dies. A plain Proof, that the &s;ame Fire is needful to &s;u&s;|tain both culinary Fire and animal Life: And a large Quantity of it. Some doubtle&s;s pervades the Oven Door; but not enough to &s;u&s;tain either Flame or Life. Indeed every Animal is a kind of Fire-Engine. As &s;oon as the Lungs in&s;pire the
<PB N="11" REF="9">Air, the Fire mingled with it is in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;|ed thro' the pulmonary Ve&s;&s;els into the Blood: Thence it is diffu&s;ed thro' every Part of the Body, even the mo&s;t minute Arteries, Veins and Nerves. In the mean Time the Lungs in&s;pire more Air and Fire, and &s;o provide a con&s;tant Supply.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Air &s;eems to be univer&s;ally impregnat|ed with this Fire, but &s;o diluted, as not to hurt the Animal in Re&s;piration. So a &s;mall Quantity of a Liquor dropt in Water, may be friendly to an human Body, tho' a few Drops of the &s;ame Li|quor, given by them&s;elv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s, would have occa&s;ioned certain Death. And yet you cannot conceive one Particle of the Water, without a Particle of the Medicine. 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible, this may be one great U&s;e of Air, by adhering &s;o clo&s;ely to the elementary Fire, to temper and render &s;alutary to the Body, what would otherwi&s;e be fatal to it.</P>
<P N="7">7. To put it beyond di&s;pute, that this Fire is largely mixt with the Air, you may make the fol|lowing Experiment. Take a round Lump of Iron, and heat it to a Degree called a <HI>welding</HI> Heat: Take it out of the Fire, and with a Pair of Bel|lows blow cold Air upon it. The Iron will then as effectually melt, as if it were in the hotte&s;t Fire. Now when taken out of the Forge, it had not Fire enough in it to conquer the Cohe&s;ion of it's Parts: But when this Fire is join'd with that which was mixt with the Air, it is &s;ufficient to do it. On the &s;ame Principle we account for the Increa&s;e of a Coal or Wood Fire by blowing it.</P>
<P N="8">8. And let none wonder that Fire &s;hould be &s;o connected with Air, as hardly to be &s;eparated. As &s;ubtle as Fire is, we may even by Art attach it to other Bodies; yea, and keep it Pri&s;oner for many Years: And that either in a &s;olid or a fluid Form. An In&s;tance of the fir&s;t we have in Steel: Which is made &s;uch, only by impacting a large Quantity of Fire into Bars of Iron. In like Manner we
<PB N="12" REF="10">impact a great Quantity of Fire into Stone, to make Lime. An In&s;tance of the &s;econd Kind we have in Spirits, wherein Fire is impri&s;on'd in a fluid Form. Hence common Spirits will burn all away. And if you throw into the Air Spirits rec|tified to the highe&s;t Degree, not one Drop will come down again, but the univer&s;al Fire will take hold of and ab&s;orb it all.</P>
<P N="9">9. That this Fire &s;ub&s;i&s;ts both in Air, Earth, and Water; that it is diffu&s;ed thro' all and every Part of the Univer&s;e, was <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> by many of the antient Naturali&s;ts, and <HI>believed</HI> by the great Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> But of late Years it has been fully demon&s;trated: Particularly, by Mr. <HI>Stephen Gray,</HI> a Pen&s;ioner at the <HI>Charterhou&s;e;</HI> who &s;ome Years &s;ince pre&s;ented to the Royal Society, an Account of many Experiments he had made, whereby this &s;ubtle Fluid became clearly perceptible both to the Sight and Feeling. Becau&s;e the Gla&s;s Tube, by Means of which tho&s;e Experiments were made, was ob&s;erved when rubbed to attract Straws and other light Bodies (a known Property of Amber, called in <HI>Latin Electrum</HI>) <HI>the&s;e</HI> Experiments were termed <HI>electrical:</HI> A Word which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;oon affixt to that &s;ubtle Fluid it&s;elf, and every Thing pertaining to it. But improperly enough: Seeing the attracting (or &s;eeming to attract) Straws and Feathers, is one of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of all the Effects, wrought by this powerful and uni|ver&s;al Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">10. It was afterwards found, that a Gla&s;s Globe was on &s;ome Accounts preferable to a Gla&s;s Tube: Particularly, as it was le&s;s Labour to turn the one for &s;ome Hours together, by means of a &s;mall Wheel, in the mean Time rubbing it with a dry Hand, or a little Cu&s;hion, than to rub the Tube for &s;o long a Time. It w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s likewi&s;e ob|&s;erved, that a greater Quantity of ethereal Fire might be <HI>collected</HI> by this Means than by the other.
<PB N="13" REF="11">I &s;ay <HI>collected;</HI> for that Fire is no more <HI>created</HI> by rubbing, than Water is by pumping. The grand Re&s;ervoir thereof is the Earth, from which it is diffu&s;ed thro' all the other Parts of common Mat|ter. Accordingly in the&s;e Experiments, the Globe rubbing again&s;t the Cu&s;hion, collects Fire from it. The Cu&s;hion receives it from the Frame of the Machine; the Frame of the Machine from the Floor. But if you cut off the Communication with the Floor, no Fire can be <HI>produced,</HI> becau&s;e none can be <HI>collected.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. In the Year 1746, Mr. de <HI>Mu&s;chenbroek,</HI> Prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;or of natural Philo&s;ophy at <HI>Leyden,</HI> was led by a ca&s;ual Experiment, into many new Di&s;cove|ries. The&s;e were chiefly made by Means of a large but thin Gla&s;s Phial. The be&s;t way to pre|pare which is, to coat it with thin Lead; to line it on the in&s;ide with Leaf-Gold, to within two Inches of the Top, and to fa&s;ten &s;ome Tin&s;el Fringe to the Bottom, (or to the End of the Wire within the Phial) &s;o as to touch the Gold Lining. By this Wire going thro' the Cork, the Phial is hung on any metallic Body, which communicates by a Wire, with the Globe or Tube. This metallic Body has been term'd, <HI>the prime Conductor,</HI> as it conducts or conveys the Fire collected by the Tube or Globe, either into the Phial, or into any other Body communicating therewith.</P>
<P N="12">12. But all Bodies are not capable of receiving it. There is in this Re&s;pect an amazing Differ|ence between them. The Excrements of Nature, as Wax, Silk, Hair, will not receive the ethereal Fire, neither convey it to other Bodies: So that whenever in circulating it comes to any of the&s;e, it is at a full &s;top. Air it&s;elf is a Body of this Kind; with great Difficulty either receiving or conveying this Fire to other Bodies: So are Pitch and Ro&s;in (Excrements, as it were, of Trees). To
<PB N="14" REF="12">the&s;e we may add Gla&s;s, Amber, Brim&s;tone, dry Earth, and a few other Bodies. The&s;e have been frequently &s;tiled <HI>Electrics per &s;e;</HI> as if they alone contain'd the <HI>electric Fire:</HI> An eminently improper Title, founded on a palpable Mi&s;take. From the &s;ame Mi&s;take, all other Bodies, which ea&s;ily re|ceive and readily convey it, were term'd <HI>Non elec|trict;</HI> on a Suppo&s;ition, that they contain'd no <HI>electric Fire:</HI> The contrary of which is now al|low'd by all.</P>
<P N="13">13. That this Fire is inconceivably &s;ubtle, ap|pears from it's permeating even the den&s;e&s;t Me|tals, and that with &s;uch Ea&s;e, as to receive no per|ceptible Re&s;i&s;tance. If any one doubt, whether it pa&s;s thro' the Sub&s;tance, or only along the Surface of Bodies, a &s;trong Shock taken thro' his own Bo|dy, will prevent his doubting any longer. It dif|fers from all other Matter in this, that the Par|ticles of it repell, not attract, each other. And hence is the manife&s;t Divergency in a Stream of electrical Effluvia. But tho' the Particles of it re|pell each other, yet are they attracted by all other Matter. And from the&s;e thr e, the extreme &s;ub|tlety of this Fire, the mutual Repul&s;ion of its Parts, and the &s;trong Attraction of them by other Mat|ter, ari&s;es this Effect, that if a Quantity of elec|tric Fire be applied to a Ma&s;s of common Matter of any Bigne&s;s or Length, (which has not already got its Quantity) it is immediately diffu&s;ed thro' the whole.</P>
<P N="14">14. It &s;eems, this Globe of Earth and Water, with its Plants, Animals, Buildings, have diffu&s;ed thro' their whole Sub&s;tance, ju&s;t as much of this Fire as they will contain. And this we may term their <HI>natural Quantity.</HI> This is not the &s;ame in all Kinds of Matter: Neither in the &s;ame Kind of Matter in all Circum&s;tances. A &s;olid Foot of one Kind of Matter (as Gla&s;s) contains more of it than
<PB N="15" REF="13">a &s;olid Foot of another Kind. And a Pound Weight of the &s;ame Kind of Matter, when rare|fied, contains more than it did before.</P>
<P N="15">15. We know that this Fire is <HI>in</HI> common Matter, becau&s;e we can pump it <HI>out,</HI> by the Globe or Tube: We know that common Matter has near as much of it as it can contain, becau&s;e if we add a little more to any Portion of it, the addi|tional Quantity does not enter, but forms a Kind of Atmo&s;phere round it. On the other Hand, we know that common Matter has not more of it than it can contain. Otherwi&s;e all loo&s;e Portions of it would repel each other; as they con&s;tantly do, when they have &s;uch Atmo&s;pheres. Had the Earth, for In&s;tance, as much electric Fire in Proportion, as we can give to a Globe of Iron or Wood, the Particles of Du&s;t and other light Matter, would not only repel each other, but be continually re|pelled from the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rth. Hence the Air being con|&s;tantly loaded therewith, would be unfit for Re|&s;piration. Here we &s;ee another Occa&s;ion to adore that Wi&s;dom, which has made all Things by Weight and Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Form of every electric Atmo&s;phere, is that of the Body which it &s;urrounds: Becau&s;e it is attracted by every Part of the Surface, tho' it can|not enter the Sub&s;tance already replete. Without this Attraction, it would not remain round the Bo|dy, but di&s;&s;ipate into the Air.</P>
<P N="17">17. The Atmo&s;phere of an electrified Sphere, is not more ea&s;ily drawn off, from any one Part of it than from the other, becau&s;e it is equally at|tracted by every Part. But it is not &s;o with Bo|dies of other Figures. From a Cube it is more ea&s;ily drawn off at the Corners than at the Sides: And &s;o from the Corners of Bodies of any other Form, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily from the &s;harpe&s;t Corners. For the Force with which an electrified Body re|tains
<PB N="16" REF="14">it's Atmo&s;phere, is proportion'd to the Sur|face on which that Atmo&s;phere re&s;ts. So a Sur|face four Inches &s;quare retains it's Atmo&s;phere, with &s;ixteen Times the Force that one of an Inch &s;quare does. And as in pulling the Hairs from an Hor&s;e's Tail, a Force in&s;ufficient to pull off an Handful at once, could ea&s;ily pull it off Hair by Hair: So tho' a blunt Body can't draw off all the Atmo&s;phere at once, a pointed one can ea&s;ily draw it off, Particle by Particle.</P>
<P N="18">18. If you would have a &s;en&s;ible Proof, how wonderfully pointed Bodies draw off the electric Fire, place an Iron Shot of four Inches Diameter on the Mouth of a dry Bottle. Su&s;pend over it a &s;mall Cork-Ball by a &s;ilken Thread, ju&s;t &s;o as to re&s;t again&s;t the Side of the Shot. Electrify the Shot, and the Ball will be repelled four or five Inches from it. Then pre&s;ent to the Shot &s;ix or eight Inches off the Point of a &s;harp Bodkin. The Fire is in&s;tantly drawn off; &s;o the Repul&s;ion cea&s;es, and the Ball flies to the Shot. But a blunt Body will not produce this Effect, till it is brought with|in an Inch of the Shot. If you pre&s;ent the Point of the Bodkin in the Dark, you may &s;ee &s;ome|times at a Foot Di&s;tance, a Light gather upon it like a Glow-worm, which is manife&s;tly the Fire it extracts from the Shot. The le&s;s &s;harp the Point is, the nearer it mu&s;t be brought, before you can &s;ee the Light. And at whatever Di&s;tance you &s;ee the Light, you may draw off the electric Fire.</P>
<P N="19">19. To be convinced that pointed Bodies <HI>throw</HI> off, as well as <HI>draw</HI> off the Fire, you may lay a long &s;harp Needle on the Shot. It cannot then be electrified, &s;o as to repel the Ball, becau&s;e the Fire thrown upon it, continually runs off, at the Point of the Needle: From which in the Dark you may &s;ee &s;uch a Stream of Light, as in the preceeding In&s;tance.</P>

<P N="20">20. While the electric Fire, which is in all Bo|dies, is left to it&s;elf, undi&s;turb'd by any external Violence, it is more or le&s;s den&s;e, according to the Nature of the Body which it is in. In den&s;e Bo|dies it is more rare: In rare Bodies it is more den&s;e. Accordingly every Body contains &s;uch a Quantity of it, rare or den&s;e, as is &s;uitable to it's Nature.

For all Bodies re&s;i&s;t either the Increa&s;e or Diminution of their natural Quan|tity. And on the other Hand, when it has been either increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, there is a Re&s;i&s;tence to it's Return to it's natural State.</P>
<P N="21">21.

<P N="22">22.

<P N="23">23. But we can electrify no Body beyond a cer|tain Degree: Becau&s;e when any is electrified to that Point, it has an Atmo&s;phere round it &s;ufficient|ly &s;trong to ballance any Power that endeavours to electrify it farther.

It is ever varying it's Condition, tho' imperceptibly, in all Parts of all Bodies what|ever; and electrifying them more or le&s;s, tho' not &s;o forcibly as to give &s;en&s;ible Signs of it. All Bo|dies then, and all their component Particles, when in their natural Situation, have round their Surfa|ces, where they are not in ab&s;olute Contact with other Surfaces, an imperceptible Atmo&s;phere &s;uffi|cient to ballance the &s;maller Force with which they are attack'd: Every Way &s;imilar to the perceptible Atmo&s;phere of Bodies forcibly electrified.

<PB N="19" REF="17">Metals are ea&s;ily electrified. Con&s;equently they have rare and therefore weakly-re&s;i&s;ting Atmo&s;|pheres. But as Heat rarefies all Bodies, &s;o if Gla&s;s be heated to a certain Degree, even below melting, it will give as free a Pa&s;&s;age to the electric Fire, as Bra&s;s or Iron does: The Atmo&s;phere round it being then rendered as rare as that of Metals. Nay, when melted, it makes no more Re&s;i&s;tence than Water. But it's Re&s;i&s;tence increa&s;es, as it cools. And when it is quite cold, it re&s;i&s;ts as forcibly as ever.

<P N="26">26. Mo&s;t Experiments will &s;ucceed as well with a Globe of Brim&s;tone, as with one of Gla&s;s. Yet there is a con&s;iderable Difference in their Nature. What Gla&s;s repells, Brim&s;tone (as al&s;o Ro&s;in) at|tracts. Rubbed Gla&s;s emits the electric Fire: Rubbed Brim&s;tone, Ro&s;in and Wax receive it. Hence if a Gla&s;s Globe be turned at one end of a prime Conductor, and a Brim&s;tone one at the other, not a Spark of Fire can be obtain'd; one receiving it in, as fa&s;t as it is given out by the other. Hence al&s;o if a Phial be &s;u&s;pended on the prime Con|ductor, with a Chain from it's Coating to the Ta|ble, and only one Globe turned, it will be elec|trified (or <HI>charged,</HI> as they term it) by twenty turns of the Wheel: After which it may be <HI>di&s;charged,</HI> that is, unelectrified, by twenty Turns of the other Wheel.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="18">
<P N="27">27 The Difference between <HI>Non Electrics</HI> (vul|garly &s;peaking) and <HI>Electrics per &s;e,</HI> is chiefly this. 1. A <HI>Non Electric</HI> ea&s;ily &s;uffers a Change, in the Quantity of Fire it contains. It's whole Quantity may be le&s;&s;en'd by drawing out a Part, which it will afterwards re&s;ume. But you can only le&s;&s;en the Quantity contain'd in one of the Surfaces of an <HI>Electric:</HI> And not that, but by adding at the &s;ame Time an equal Quantity to the other Surface. So that the whole Gla&s;s will always have the &s;ame Quantity in it's two Surfaces And even this can only be done in Gla&s;s that is thin: Beyond a cer|tain Thickne&s;s we know no Power that can make this Change. 2. The ethereal Fire freely moves from Place to Place, in and thro' the Sub&s;tance of a <HI>Non Electric.</HI> But thro' the Sub&s;tance of an <HI>Electric</HI> it will by no Means pa&s;s. It freely en|ters an Iron-Rod, and moves from one End to another, where the Overplus is di&s;charged. But it will not enter, or move thro a Gla&s;s-Rod. Nei|ther will the thinne&s;t Gla&s;s which can be made, &s;uffer any Particle of it entering one of it's Sur|faces, to pa&s;s thro' to the other.</P>
<P N="28">28. Indeed it is only Metals and Liquids, that perfectly <HI>conduct</HI> (or tran&s;mit) this Fire. Other Bo|dies &s;eem to conduct it, only &s;o far as they contain a Mixture of the&s;e; accordingly, moi&s;t Air will con|duct it, in Proportion to it's Moi&s;tne&s;s. But dry Air will not conduct it at all: On the contrary, it is the main in&s;trument, in confining any electric Atmo&s;phere, to the Body which it &s;urrounds. Dry Air prevents it's di&s;&s;ipating (which it does pre&s;ently when <HI>in vacuo</HI>) or pa&s;&s;ing from Body to Body. A clear Bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">le full of Air, in&s;tead of Water, can|not be electrified. But exhau&s;ted of Air, it is elec|trified as effectually as if it was full of Water. Yet an Electrical Atmo&s;phere and Air, do not ex|clued one another. For we breath in it freely,
<PB N="21" REF="19">and dry Air will blow thro' it, without altering it at all.</P>
<P N="29">29. When a Gla&s;s Phial is electrified, whate|ver Quantity of Fire is accumulated on the in|ner Surface, an equal Quantity is taken from the outer. Suppo&s;e, before the Operation begins, the Quantity of Fire contain'd in each Surface, is equal to twenty Grains: Suppo&s;e at every Turn of the Globe, one Grain is thrown in: Then after the fir&s;t Stroke there are twenty one within, nine|teen only without: After the &s;econd, the inner Sur|face will have twenty-two, the outer but eighteen: And &s;o on, till after twenty Strokes, the inner will have forty, the outer none. And the. Opera|tion ends: For no Power or Art of Man can throw any more on the inner Surface, when no more can be taken from the outer. If you attempt to throw more in, it is thrown back thro' the Wire, or flies cut in Cracks thro' the Sides of the Phial. The Equilibrium cannot be re&s;tored in this Phial, but by a Communication form'd between the inner and outer Surface, by &s;omething external, touching both the outer, and the Wire which communicates with the inner Surface. If you touch the&s;e by Turns, it is re&s;tored by Degrees: If both at once, it is re&s;tored in&s;tantly. But then there is a Shock occa&s;ioned by the &s;udden pa&s;&s;ing of the Fire thro' the Body, in it's Way from the inner to the outer Surface. For it moves from the Wire to the Fin|ger, (not from the Finger to the Wire, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed). Thence it pa&s;&s;es thro' the Body to the other Hand, and &s;o to the outer Sur|face.</P>
<P N="30">30. The Force with which this Shock may be given, is far greater than one would conceive. It will kill Rats, Hens, or even Turkeys in a Mo|ment: Others, that are not quite killed, it &s;trikes blind. It will give Polarity to a fine Needle, mak|ing
<PB N="22" REF="20">it point North and South, as if touched by a Load&s;tone. It will invert the Polarity of a Com|pa&s;s, and make the North Point turn to the South. At the &s;ame Time the Ends of the Needles are fine|ly blued like the Spring of a Watch. It will melt off the Heads and Points of Pins and Needles: And &s;ometimes the whole Surface of the Needle is run and appears as it were bli&s;ter'd, when examined by a magnifying Gla&s;s. It will melt thin Gold or Sil|ver, when held tight between two Panes of Gla&s;s, together with the Surface of the Gla&s;s it&s;elf, and incorporate them in a fine Enamel. Yea a &s;trong Spark from an electrified Phial, makes a fair Hole thro' a Quire of Paper doubled: Which is thought good Armour again&s;t the Pu&s;h of a Sword, or even a Pi&s;tol Bullet. And 'tis amazing to ob&s;erve in how &s;mall a Portion of Gla&s;s, a great Electrical Force may be. A thin Gla&s;s-Bubble, about an Inch Diameter, being half filled with Water, part|ly gilt on the out&s;ide, when electrified gives as &s;trong a Shock as a Man can well bear: Allowing then that it contains no more Fire after charging than before, how much Fire mu&s;t there be in this &s;mall Gla&s;s! It &s;eems to be a Part of it's very Sub|&s;tance. Perhaps if that Fire could be &s;eparated from it, it would be no longer Gla&s;s. It might in lo&s;ing this lo&s;e its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Properties, it's Tran&s;parency&punc; Brittlene&s;s, and Ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P N="31">31. Some have not improbably &s;uppo&s;ed, that all <HI>Electric</HI> Bodies, &s;o called, are by their original Con|&s;titution, thro'ly &s;aturated with Electric Fire: That it remains fixt in them, (unle&s;s while the Texture of tho&s;e Bodies is quite alter'd by Liquefaction) that Fire fixt in a Body con&s;titutes an <HI>Electric,</HI> and all Bodies where it is not fixt are <HI>Non Electries.</HI> Agreeably to which they &s;uppo&s;e that in all <HI>Non Electrics,</HI> the Original Fire, loo&s;ely inhering, is ea&s;ily driven on by the new collected Fire, which
<PB N="23" REF="21">then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its Place: But that in <HI>Electrics</HI> the Original Fire being impacted into their Sub&s;tance, and therefore more firmly inhering, will not give Way to, or be driven on by, the new collected Fire. Such is Air in particular; with the Particles of which the original Fire is clo&s;ely incorporated. Dry Air &s;eems to be &s;o fully &s;aturated with it, that it is &s;carce capable of receiving any more: Where|as all n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">w-collected Fire is continually endeavour|ing to return into the Earth. Let Wires be elec|trified ever &s;o &s;trongly, yet the Moment any Part of them is touch'd by a Per&s;on &s;tanding on the Floor, they are electrified no longer; all the Fire e&s;caping thro' him into the Earth.</P>
<P N="32">32. Upon the Principles of Electricity, we may give a more rational Account, of many Appearan|ces in Nature, than has yet been done: Of Thun|der and Lightning in particular. In order to which we may ob&s;erve, all electrified Bodies retain the Fire thrown into them, till &s;ome Non-electric ap|proaches: To which it is then communicated with a Snap, and becomes equally divided. Electric Fire is &s;trongly attracted by Water, and readily mixes with it. And Water being electrified, the Vapours ari&s;ing from it, are equally electrified. As the&s;e float in the Air, they retain the additional Fire, till they meet with Clouds not &s;o much electrified. Then they communicate it with a Shock.</P>
<P N="33">33. The Ocean is compounded of Water, and Salt; one an Electric, the other not. When there is a Friction among the Parts near its Surface, the Fire is collected from the Parts below. It is then plainly vi&s;ible in the Night, at the Stern of every failing Ve&s;&s;el. It appears from every Da&s;h of an Oar: In Storms the whole Sea &s;eems on Fire. The Particles of Water then repell'd from the electrified Surface, continually carry off the Fire as it is col|lected. They ri&s;e and form Clouds which are high|ly
<PB N="24" REF="22">electrified, and retain the Fire till they have an Opportunity of di&s;charging it.</P>
<P N="34">34. Particles of Water ri&s;ing in Vapours, attach them&s;elves to Particles of Air. One Particle of Air may be &s;urrounded by twelve Particles of Water as large as it&s;elf, all touching it, and by more added to them. Particles of Air thus loaded would be drawn nearer together by the mutual Attraction of the Particles of Water, did not the Fire, Common or Electric, included therein, a&s;&s;i&s;t their mutual Repul&s;ion. Hence they continue &s;u&s;pended. But if Air thus loaded, be compre&s;s'd by adver&s;e Winds, or by being driven again&s;t Mountains, or if it be conden&s;ed by the Lo&s;s of it's Fire, it will continue &s;u&s;pended no longer, but will de&s;cend in Dew. And if the Water &s;urroun ing one Particle of Air comes into contact with that &s;urrounding another, they naturally coale&s;ce into a Drop, and &s;o de&s;cend in Rain.</P>
<P N="35">35. The Sun &s;upplies common Fire to all Va|pours, ri&s;ing either from Sea or Land. Vapours having both this and Electric Fire, are better &s;up|ported than tho&s;e which have this only. For when Vapours ri&s;e into the colde&s;t Region, the common Fire may fail. But the Cold will not dimini&s;h the Electric: This is always the &s;ame. Hence Clouds rai&s;ed from fre&s;h Waters, from moi&s;t Earth, or growing Vegetables, more ea&s;ily de&s;cend and de|po&s;ite their Waters, as having but little Electric Fire, to keep the Particles &s;eparate from each other. So that the greate&s;t Part of the Water rai&s;ed from the Land, falls on the Land again. But Clouds rai&s;ed from the Sea, having both Fires, and much of the Electric, &s;upport their Water far more &s;trong|ly, and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Winds, may bring it from the Middle of the wide&s;t Ocean to the Middle of the broade&s;t Continent. And yet a Way is pro|vided whereby the&s;e al&s;o are readily brought to de|po&s;ite
<PB N="25" REF="23">their Water. For whenever they are driven again&s;t Mountains by the Winds, tho&s;e Mountains take away their Electric Fire: And being cold, the common al&s;o: Hence the Particles immediately clo&s;e. If the Air was not much loaded, the Water falls in Dew on the Top and the Sides of the Mountain. If it was, the Electric Fire being taken at once from the whole Cloud, it fla&s;hes brightly, and cracks loudly. And the Particles in&s;tantly coale&s;|cing for want of that Fire, fall in an heavy Shower.</P>
<P N="36">36. When a Ridge of Mountains &s;tops the Clouds, and draws the Electric Fire from the Cloud fir&s;t approaching it, the next when it comes near the fir&s;t, now deprived of it's Fire, fla&s;hes into it, and depo&s;ites it's own Water. The third Cloud approaching, and all that &s;ucceed, act in the &s;ame Manner; as far back as they extend, which may be for &s;everal hundred Miles. Hence the continual Storms of Thunder, Lightning and Rain, on the Ea&s;t Side of tho&s;e va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t Mountains, the <HI>Andes,</HI> which running North and South, intercept all the Clouds brought again&s;t them from the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean. In a plain Country, there are other Means to make them drop their Water. For if an electrified Cloud coming from the Sea, meets in the Air a Cloud coming from the Land, and therefore not electri|fied, the fir&s;t will give it's Fla&s;h into the latter, and thereby both will be made to depo&s;ite their Wa|ter. The Concu&s;&s;ion of the Air contributes al&s;o to &s;hake down the Water, not only from tho&s;e two Clouds, but from others near them. When the Sea and Land Clouds would pa&s;s at too great a Di&s;tance from each other, they are mutually attracted till within the Di&s;tance. For the Sphere of Electrical Attraction is far beyond the fla&s;hing Di&s;tance. And yet where a Cloud contains much Fire, it may &s;trike at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance. When a Con|ductor
<PB N="26" REF="24">has but little Fire in it, you mu&s;t approach very near before you can draw a Spark. Throw into it a greater Quantity of Fire, and it will give a Spark at a greater Di&s;tance. But if a Gun Bar|rel, when electrified, will &s;trike and make a Noi&s;e, at the Di&s;tance of an Inch, at what a Di&s;tance, and with how great a No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, may ten thou&s;and Acres of electrified Cloud &s;trike? No Wonder that this &s;hould melt Metals (which our artificial Fla&s;h does in &s;ome Degree) tho' perhaps not &s;o properly by it's Heat, as by in&s;inuating into the Pores, and cre|ating a violent Repul&s;ion between the Particles of the Metal it pa&s;&s;es thro'. This overcomes the At|traction whereby they cohere, and &s;o melts the me|tallic Body. And this accounts for its melting a Sword in the Scabbard, or Gold in the Pocket, without burning either.</P>
<P N="37">37. But Thunder Clouds do not always contain more than their natural Quantity of Electric Fire. Very frequently they contain le&s;s. And when this is the Ca&s;e, when they are negatively electrified, altho' the Effects and Appearances are nearly the &s;ame, yet the Manner of Operation is different. For in this Ca&s;e, it is really the Fire from the Mountains, or other Part of the Earth which &s;trikes into the Cloud; and not, as we imagine, Fire from the Cloud which &s;trikes into the Earth. And we may ea&s;ily conceive, how a Cloud may be nega|tively electrified. When a Portion of Water is rare|fied into a thin Vapour, the Fire it contains is rare|fied too. Con&s;equently it has then le&s;s than it's natural Quantity of Fire. Such a Cloud therefore coming within a due Di&s;tance of the Earth, will receive from it a Fla&s;h of Electric Fire; which Fla&s;h, to &s;upply a great Extent of Cloud, mu&s;t of|ten contain a great Quantity of Fire. Such a Cloud al&s;o pa&s;&s;ing over Woods of tall Trees, may &s;ilently receive &s;ome Supply, either from the Points of the
<PB N="27" REF="25">Boughs, or from the &s;harp Ends and Edges of the Leaves. The Cloud thus &s;upplied, fla&s;hes into other Clouds that have not been &s;o &s;upplied; and tho&s;e into others, till an Equilibrium is produced, among all that are within a &s;triking Di&s;tance of each other. And hence are repeated Strokes and Fla&s;hes, till they de&s;cend in Showers to the Earth, their Original. Rain, e&s;pecially when in large Drops, generally brings down the Electric Fire: Falling Snow often: Summer Hail, always, tho' &s;ilently. Con&s;equently, any of the&s;e may prevent Thunder and Lightning; or at lea&s;t, abate it's Violence. Rain is helpful in another Re&s;pect like|wi&s;e. By wetting Men or Bea&s;ts, it &s;aves many Lives. For if your Cl athes are thro'ly wet, and a Fla&s;h of Lightning &s;trikes the Top of your Head, it will run in the Water over the Surface of your Bo|dy into the Ground: Whereas if your Cl aths were not wet, it would go thro' your Body. Hence a wet Chicken cannot be killed by a Stroke from the Phial; whereas a dry one is kill'd in an In&s;tant.

<P N="38">38. Common Fire (if it be any thing more, than a different Modification of the &s;ame Element) is more or le&s;s in all Bodies, as well as Electrical. If there be a &s;ufficient Quantity of either in any Bo|dy, it is inflamed. But when the Quantity of com|mon Fire therein is &s;mall there needs more Elec|tric Fire to infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">me it. Where the Quantity of common Fire is greater, le&s;s of the Electric will &s;uffice. So if Spirits are heated, a &s;mall Spark in|flames

Sulphureous Vapours, whether ri&s;ing from the Earth, or from Stacks of moi&s;t Hay or Corn&punc; or any other heated and reeking Vegetable, contain ab ndance of common Fire.

Rai&s;e this Kite when a Thunder-Storm is coming on: But he that holds the String, mu&s;t &s;tand in a Porch, or under &s;ome other Covering, that the Ribbon may not be wet. He mu&s;t likewi&s;e take particular Care, that the Twine do not touch the Top or Side of the Porch. As &s;oon as the Thunder-Cloud comes over the Kite, the pointed Wire draws the Electric Fire from it. The Kite and all the Twine are then electrified, as plainly appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rs by this, that the loo&s;e Filaments of the Twine &s;tand out every way, and are attracted by an approaching Finger. And when the Kite and Twine being wet, conduct the Fire freely, it will &s;tream from the Key, on the Ap|proach of the Knuckle. By this Key the Phial may be charged, and all other Experiments made, as by the Globe. And this is a Demon&s;tration,
<PB N="29" REF="27">that the Electric Fire thereby obtain'd, is the very &s;ame with that of Lightning.</P>
<P N="40">40. May not the Knowledge of this Power in pointed Bodies, of drawing off the Fire contain'd in the&s;e Clouds, &s;ugge&s;t to us a very probable Me|thod, of pre&s;erving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;es, Churche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, Ships from the Stroke of Lightning?

Let it not be objected, that the u&s;|ing this probable Means of preventing a threatning Danger, would imply any Denial of, or Di&s;tru&s;t in, Divine Providence Not at all: We know the Creator of the Univer&s;e, is likewi&s;e the Go|vernor of all Things therein. But we know like|wi&s;e that he gove ns by &s;econd Cau&s;es; and that accordingly it is his Will, we &s;hould u&s;e all the probable Means he has given us, to attain every lawful End. It is therefore no more an Impeach|ment of his Providence, when we fore&s;ee a Storm of Lightning and Rain, to &s;helter our Hou&s;e (as far as we are able) from the one, than to &s;helter our|&s;elves in that Hou&s;e from the other. Is it not ju&s;t as innocent (if it be po&s;&s;ible) to keep our Rooms tight from Lightning, as from Wind and Water?</P>
<P N="41">41. It may not be improper to add one or two Ob&s;ervations, before we proceed to what is of more Importance. Scarce any Phenomenon in Nature
<PB N="30" REF="28">has been e&s;teem'd more difficult to be accounted for than tho&s;e luminous Appearances in the Sky, term'd <HI>Aurora Borealis,</HI> or <HI>Northern Lights.</HI> But the&s;e al|&s;o may be rationally explain'd, upon the Principles of Electricity. We often &s;ee Clouds at different Heights, pa&s;&s;ing different Ways, North and South at the &s;ame Time. This manife&s;tly proves differ|ent Currents of Air, one of them under the other. Now as the Air between the Tropics is rarefied by the Sun, it ri&s;es; the den&s;er Air pre&s;&s;ing into it's Place. The Air &s;o rai&s;ed, moves North and South, and if it has no Opportunity before, mu&s;t de&s;cend in the Polar Regions. When this Air with it's Va|pours de&s;cends into contact with the Vapours ari&s;|ing there, the Electric Fire which it brought be|gins to be communicated, and is &s;een in clear Nights; being fir&s;t vi&s;ible where it is fir&s;t in Mo|tion, namely in the mo&s;t Northern Parts. But from thence the Streams of Light &s;eem to &s;hoot Souther|ly, even to the Zenith of Northern Countries.</P>
<P N="42">42. Another Phenomenon of a totally different Kind, may be accounted for on the &s;ame Princi|ples, altho' Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Solomon</HI> him&s;elf to a&s;k, as a Que&s;tion which he could not an&s;wer,
<Q><L>"Whence does it happen, that the Plant which well</L>
<L>We name the <HI>Sen&s;itive,</HI> &s;hould move and feel?</L>
<L>Whence know her Leaves to an&s;wer her Command,</L>
<L>And with quick Horror fly the neighbouring Hand?"</L></Q></P>
<P>Allowing for Poetical Amplification the plain Fact is this. The Sen&s;itive Plant, as it were, &s;hrinks away, as &s;oon as your Hand approaches it. And from a turgid and vivid Appearance, in&s;tantly droops and hangs it's Leaves. Now &s;uppo&s;e this Plant to contain more Electric Fire than any other Plant or
<PB N="31" REF="29">Animal, it mu&s;t or Cour&s;e communicate that Fire, to any other that touches it. And if &s;o, it's Leaves and Branches mu&s;t be in a languid State, till they have recover'd their natural Quantity. To illu&s;trate this, &s;et any &s;mall Tree in a Pot on a Cake of Brim&s;tone. Electrify it and it grows extremely turgid, &s;o as to erect it's Leaves. But the Mo|ment you touch one of them, the whole Tree droops, and hangs all it's Leaves and Branches.</P>
<P>To throw all the Light I can on the Subject, I &s;ubjoin a few Extracts from &s;everal other Writers.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>An Extract from Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI>'s Experiments and Ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When two Plates, the one electrified, the other not, were brought near each other, the Fla&s;h|es of <HI>bright Flame</HI> were &s;o large, that in a dark Room, I could di&s;tinctly &s;ee the Faces of 13 Per|&s;ons. P. 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Piece of large blunt Wire was hung to the Conductor. To the End of this when electrified a black Surface not electrified being brought near, (tho' not near enough to cau&s;e a Snap) a Bru&s;h of <HI>Blue Flame,</HI> quite different from the former, i&s;&s;ued of more than an Inch long, and an Inch thick. P. 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. If a Per&s;on &s;trongly electrified lays his Hand on the Cloaths of one that is not, e&s;pecially if they are thin Woollen or Silk, they both feel as it were <HI>many Pins pricking</HI> them, as long as the Globe is in Motion.</P>
<P N="4">4. If Oil of Turpentine be &s;et on Fire in a Ve&s;|&s;el held by one electrified, <HI>the Smoke</HI> ari&s;ing there|from, received again&s;t a Plate held at a Foot Di&s;|tance from the Flame, by one &s;tanding on Ro&s;in, will enable him to Fire warm Spirits of Wine. The Electric Strokes have been likewi&s;e felt, upon touching the &s;econd Man, when the Plate he held
<PB N="32" REF="30">in the Smoke has been between &s;even and eight Feet above the Flame. P. 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. Take burning Spirits of Wine in&s;tead of Oil of Turpentine: And if the &s;econd Man hold the End of an Iron Rod at the Top of the <HI>Flame,</HI> he may k ndle other warm Spirits held near his Finger. Hence we find that either Smoke or Flame con|ducts the Electric Fire, and does not perceptibly dimini&s;h it's Force. P 9.</P>
<P N="6">6. If the Wire of the Phial be not touched, the electrified Water or Steel Du&s;t will retain it's Force many Hours, may be convey'd &s;everal Miles, and will afterward exert it's Force upon touching the Wire. P. 16.</P>
<P N="7">7. If an Egg is hung on the Conductor, and a Per&s;on gra&s;ping the electrified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hial with one Hand, brings the Palm of his other near the Bottom of the Egg, he receives a &s;mart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">troke on the Hand, as with a Ferula, and his Hand &s;eems full of a more red Fire than is u&s;ually ob&s;erved.

<P N="12">12. That the Electric Atmo&s;phere which &s;ur|rounds all electrified Bodies, extends to a con&s;ider|able Di&s;tance, appears from their attracting a fine Thread, at the Di&s;tance of &s;ome Feet. If no un|electrified Body is near, this Atmo&s;phere &s;eems to be equally &s;pread over that which is electrified. But if one unelectrified is brought near, the greate&s;t Part of it is determined that Way; whence the Attraction of the other Parts of the electrified Body
<PB N="34" REF="32">is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed. This is the Cau&s;e of Electric Repul&s;ion, which does not operate, till the Electric Ether is &s;ufficiently accumulated.

<P>Prop. 1. When two Bodies equally replete with Electric Matter approach each other, no Flame or Snap will en&s;ue. P. 5.</P>
<P>Prop. 2. Two Bodies equally electrified repel each other. P. 6.</P>
<P>Prop. 3. An Electric Body interpo&s;ed between a Per&s;on and the Earth, prevents his exciting Elec|tricity in another Body by Friction. P. 11.</P>
<P>Prop. 4. If there is originally a certain Quanti|ty of Electric Matter in a Body of a given Mag|nitude and Den&s;ity; and that Matter be equally di&s;tributed therein, by it's Ela&s;tic Force, according to the Den&s;ity of the Parts: Upon increa&s;ing the Quantity of Matter by adding other Bodies of the &s;ame Kind, the Quantity of Electric Matter will be increa&s;ed in the &s;ame Proportion. P. 14.</P>
<P>Prop. 5. As Electric Bodies act on light Bo|dies that are not electrified, &s;o unelectrified Bodies act on the Electric Matter contain'd in electrified Bodies. P. 16.</P>
<P>Let a Wire be electrified in the Dark, and if you hold any unelectrified Body 7 or 8 Inches from the End of it, a Stream of Fire will i&s;&s;ue from it, which will diverge to that Body. But the Diver|gency will le&s;&s;en as it approaches it, till the Rays become parallel. If the Body be held not directly before the End of the Wire, but wide of it at about two Inches Di&s;tance, the Fire will de&s;cribe curvilinear Rays towards that Body. P. 17.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="34">
<P>Hence it appears, that unelectrified Bodies act in like Manner with electrified: Only the acting Force of the one&punc; being increa&s;ed by Friction, is greater than that of the other.</P>
<P>Prop. 6. When two equally Electric Atmo&s;|pheres are brought &s;o near as to touch, they repell each other with a Force equal to their Den&s;i|ties. P. 19.</P>
<P>Prop. 7. If while a Fluid &s;urrounds a Globe which is electrified and turn'd round an Axis pa&s;|&s;ing thro' it's Center, an unelectrified Body be held near the Equator of it, the Fluid will ri&s;e &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively towards that Body, as it turns round, in like Manner as the Sea is affected by the Moon.

<P>The Shock given by the Phial is in Proportion to the Size of it, the thinne&s;s of the Gla&s;s, and the Number of Points in contact with it's Sur|face. P. 25.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>An Extract from Mr. <HI>Martin</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay on Electricity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Electric Matter</HI> is emitted from &s;ome &s;ort of Bodies when rubb'd, which are call'd <HI>Elec|trics.</HI> P. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. By other Sorts of Bodies, therefore term'd <HI>Non-Electrics,</HI> it is not emitted.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will run off to all <HI>Non-Electrics,</HI> but it re|&s;trained by all Electrics.</P>
<P N="4">4. It &s;hines like a <HI>Flame,</HI> and is emitted with a <HI>Snap:</HI> If towards a <HI>Non Electric,</HI> the Fire is con|den&s;ed, le&s;s or more, and &s;o appears of a blui&s;h, Purple, Yellow, or White Colour.</P>
<P>When the Electric Fire is not &s;o much conden&s;|ed as to explode, as in Thunder and Lightning it goes off in a dilated Stream of purple Flame, great|ly re&s;embling that Part of the <HI>Aurora Borealis,</HI> which appears in Streams of Light.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="35">
<P>When it is little conden&s;ed, it appears <HI>blui&s;h,</HI> as all other faint Lights do: When a little den&s;er, it appears <HI>Purple:</HI> When den&s;er &s;till, it looks <HI>Yellow,</HI> like Candle Light: When highly conden&s;ed, it is clear and <HI>white,</HI> like the Light of the Sun. So the White Lightning is of all others mo&s;t fierce. So Pho&s;phorus rubb'd a little, &s;pends it&s;elf in an harmle&s;s Blue Flame: But upon a greater Attriti|on, kindles into a White Flame, and burns with an outragious and unquenchable Fire. p. 17.</P>
<P>And as Lightning pervades &s;oft Sub&s;tances un|hurt, but di&s;&s;olves hard and compact Bodies, &s;o Electric Fire pervades the &s;oft, mu&s;cular Parts of the Body, but violently &s;trikes the Bones and Ten|dons. Again, as tho&s;e den&s;er Parts of Lightning which we call Thunder-Bolts, &s;triking again&s;t hard Bodies, glance by Reflection to different Parts, &s;o this Fire, &s;triking again&s;t the Elbow, is reflected from thence acro&s;s the Brea&s;t, to the other El|bow. p. 18.</P>
<P>Indeed different Per&s;ons are affected thereby in a very different Manner. Some are extremely ca|pable of it, &s;ome not: And &s;ome are not &s;u&s;cep|tible of it at all: A Per&s;on, for In&s;tance, who has the Small-Pox, cannot be electrified by any Means whatever. p. 20.</P>
<P>Experiment 1. On the Axis, in the Center of my Globe, is fixt a circular String of Threads. When the Globe is at re&s;t, they all hang down: When it is in Motion, they all extend them&s;elves from the Center, &s;trait toward the inner Surface of the Globe (like the Spokes of a Coach-Wheel) which they nearly touch. Thus they continue till the Electric Virtue cea&s;es, and then gradually fall down, as at fir&s;t. p. 22.</P>
<P>Exp. 2. While they are extended, if you move your Hand toward the Surface of the Globe, they move every Way toward the Hand. Hence we &s;ee
<PB N="38" REF="36">the amazing Subtlety of this Fire, which pervades Gla&s;s as readily as if nothing were in the Way.</P>
<P>Exp. 3. Place a Hoop of Fine Threads rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Globe in Motion, and all of them will &s;tand perpendicular to the Surface. Hence we learn that the Electric Power acts equally, both within and without the Globe, and in Directions perpendicu|lar to it's Surface.</P>
<P>Exp. 4. If the Room be then darken'd, the Ends of the Threads on the Out&s;ide, will be all tipt with Fire. But tho&s;e within are not, which &s;hews that this Power acts only <HI>ab intra</HI> out|wardly. p. 23.</P>
<P>Exp. 5. An Iron Rod being hung on Silken Strings, with one End about &frac14; of an Inch from the Globe, will at the other End (which terminates in a conical Point) emit a Purple Flame diverging every Way. Hold your Finger within &frac14; of an Inch, and the Fire will i&s;&s;ue more largely. p. 24.</P>
<P>Exp. 6. Hold your Finger &s;till nearer, and the Rays will be &s;o conden&s;ed as to run to it in a Stream of Yellow Flame; which is al&s;o &s;en&s;ible to the Feeling, as a gentle Wind, and &s;mells like the Fire of Pho&s;phorus.</P>
<P>Exp. 7. If you put your Finger on the Rod, the Flame in&s;tantly di&s;appears, the Fire all running off upon the Finger. But take it off, and the Flame appears again.</P>
<P>Exp. 8. Apply your Finger near a Tin Tube &s;o &s;u&s;pended, and you may &s;ee the Fire, and both hear and feel the Snap. p. 25.</P>
<P>Exp. 14. Under an electrified Plate, put &s;ome Leaf-Gold or other light Sub&s;tances on another Plate unelectrified: And it will be attracted and repell'd alternately, between the two Plates. For, each Time it touches the lower Plate, it di&s;charges he Electric Fire, and &s;o becomes again attract|ble. p. 28.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="37">
<P>Exp. 18. If to a Gun Barrel you adapt a &s;mall Tin Cup, and pour in Water; a Per&s;on holding his Finger perpendicular over the Water, within &frac14; of an Inch of it's Surface, will find the Water ri&s;e in Form of a Cone to meet his Finger, and from the Top of it, a Stream of Fire will i&s;&s;ue to the Finger and &s;nap as u&s;ual p. 30.</P>

<P>When the Machine is to be u&s;ed, the Globe &s;hould be wiped clean, with a clean, dry, warm Flannel, it's Pivots oil'd, and the Cu&s;hion and Phial warmed. In damp Weather, there &s;hould be a Fire in the Room. p 4.</P>
<P>Exp. 4. Let an unelectrify'd Plate, with &s;cour|ing Sand upon it, be held 5 or 6 Inches under an electrify'd Plate, and the Sand will be &s;o attracted and repell'd, as to re&s;emble a &s;tormy Shower. p. 16.</P>
<P>Exp. 7. If a Gla&s;s Ball, of 4 or 5 Inches dia|meter, be hung by a Wire to the Gun-barrel, and a Ball of &frac34; of an Inch diameter, exceeding thin, placed on a &s;mooth Plate, be brought near it, this will not only be attracted by the large Ball, but will perform continual Revolutions round it, ex|actly as the Planets do round the Sun. p. 22.</P>
<P>Exp. 9. Hang a Load&s;tone on the Barrel, and a Key on the Armature of it: And if you bring
<PB N="41" REF="39">your Finger near the Key, it will &s;nap and emit Fire. A plain Proof that the electric and magnetic Power no way hinder each other. p. 25.</P>
<P>Exp. 35. A Sparrow kill'd by the electric Shock, was found livid without, as if kill'd with a Fla&s;h of Lightning, and mo&s;t of the Blood Ve&s;&s;els within were bur&s;t. Animals &s;hock'd on the Head, if not kill'd, are commonly &s;truck blind. p. 55.</P>
<P>Exp. 41. Ice held by an electrify'd Per&s;on, will fire warm Spirits of Wine. p. 61.</P>
<P>Exp. 43. Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> put an Ounce of Oil of Vitriol, an Ounce of Iron Filings&punc; and four Ounces of Water, into a Fla&s;k. An Ebullition en&s;ued. An electrify'd Per&s;on applied his Finger to the Mouth of the Fla&s;k. The Vapour took fire, and burnt out of the Neck a long Time. p. 63.</P>
<P>From an Experiment made by Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> and others, it appear'd, that the electric Fire circulat|ed, without Interruption, from the <HI>Surry</HI> Side of the <HI>Thames</HI> over <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Bridge, to the <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> Side, and thence thro' the River to the <HI>Surry</HI> Side again, which is upwards of 800 Yards. Spirits of Wine al&s;o were fired at the &s;ame Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From this, and &s;everal other Experiments, it ap|peared, that Di&s;tance, &s;imply con&s;idered, did lit|tle, if at all, impair the Force of the electric Shock.</P>
<P>They afterwards convey'd this Shock thro' a Circuit of four Miles, and &s;ound the Motion of the electric Fire to be nearly, if not quite, in&s;tan|taneous.</P>

<P N="2">II. I have been hitherto endeavouring to make Electricity plain: I &s;hall endeavour, in the &s;econd Place, to make it u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="1">1. This ethereal Fire, in its unmixt State, &s;eems too violent an Agent for the human Body to bear. Therefore the wi&s;e Author of Nature has provided the Air to temper and adapt it to our U&s;e. So temper'd, it is the grand In&s;trument of Life: "It
<PB N="42" REF="40">gives and pre&s;erves," &s;ays Bi&s;hop <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rkeley,</HI> "a pro|per Tone to the Ve&s;&s;els. It promotes all Secretions, keeping every Part in Motion: It pervades the whole Animal Sy&s;tem, producing great Variety of Effects, various Vibrations in the Solids, and Fer|ments in the Fluids." Indeed from many Experi|ments we know, it communicates Activity and Mo|tion to Fluids in general, and particularly accele|rates the Motion of the Blood in an human Body. This is quickened three or four Pul&s;es in half a Minute, by a Per&s;on only &s;tanding on Gla&s;s, and being electrified. And it is certain many bodily Di&s;orders may be removed, even by this &s;afe and ea&s;y Operation.</P>
<P N="2">2. But becau&s;e plain Matters of Fact weigh more than nice &s;peculative Rea&s;oning with all who do not ob&s;tinately &s;teel them&s;elves again&s;t Con|viction, I &s;hall fir&s;t, briefly &s;pecify &s;everal Di&s;or|ders wherein Electrification has been found emi|nently u&s;eful, and then &s;ubjoin a few particular In|&s;tances.</P>

<P>It will be ea&s;ily ob&s;erved, that a great Part of the&s;e are of the nervous Kind; and perhaps there is no nervous Di&s;temper whatever, which would not yield to a &s;teady U&s;e of this Remedy. It &s;eems therefore to be the grand <HI>De&s;ideratum</HI> in Phy&s;ic, from which we may expect Relief when all other Relief fails, even in many of the mo&s;t painful and &s;tubborn Di&s;orders to which the human Frame is liable.</P>
<P>I have &s;carce known an In&s;tance wherein a few Shocks all over the Body, have failed to cure either a <HI>Quotidian</HI> or <HI>Tertian Ague.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anne Heathco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> Daughter of Mr. <HI>Heathcote</HI> Bra|&s;ier, in <HI>Long Alley,</HI> near <HI>Moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">fields,</HI> was &s;eized, in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, with what is commonly called an <HI>Ague in the Head,</HI> having a violent Pain in her Head, Face, and Teeth. After trying abundance of Re|medies, to no purpo&s;e, &s;he was, in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> electri|fied thro' the Head. Immediately the Pain fix'd in her Teeth. She was electrified four Times more, and has felt nothing of it &s;ince.</P>
<P N="4">4. "Having ob&s;erved," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Lovet,</HI> "the great Efficacy of electrical Ether, in &s;oon relieving mo&s;t Kind of <HI>Inflammations,</HI> I was inclined to think the &s;ame Efficacy would appear when it was applied to <HI>St. Anthony's Fire.</HI> But when a Ca&s;e offered, the Inflammation was &s;o great, that at fir&s;t I almo&s;t de&s;pair'd of Succe&s;s.

<P N="5">5. A Boy about &s;even Years old (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Floyer,</HI> a Surgeon in <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI>) was taken blind &s;uddenly in both his Eyes, without any previous Pain or Fever. Three or four Days after, he was brought to me. He was as blind, as if his Eyes had been cut out. Taking the Ca&s;e to be a perfect <HI>Gutta Serena</HI> in both Eyes, I told his Parents, it was my Opinion he would never &s;ee again. However I determined to try the Electric Shock: And the next Morning, fa&s;tening a Wire coming from the Phial to his Leg, and another round his Head, I brought the Latter near the Conductor, and gave him four Shocks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. That Day he was put to Bed, and continued there, &s;weating profu&s;ely, till the next Morning, when he agreeably alarm'd his Father by crying out, he could &s;ee the Win|dow. When he was brought to me the &s;econd Time, he could &s;ee when I put my Hand between his Eyes and the Light of the Sun. This gave me Encouragement to repeat what we had done the Day before. The next Day he could a little con|tract and dilate his Eyes; the Third Day he could di&s;tingui&s;h Objects; the Fourth, Colours. The Fifth Day, after repeating the Experiment, his Sight was perfectly re&s;tor'd, and the Eyes, in every Re&s;pect, as well as if no Di&s;order had happened to them.</P>
<P N="6">6. From a Gentleman in <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne,</HI> I have the following Account. La&s;t Week a poor Man in <HI>Sandgate,</HI> that had been blind twenty-four Years, was led to the Machine. I &s;et him upon the Electrical Board, and drew Sparks for about twenty Minutes from the Pupil of his Eye. Af|ter he had re&s;ted him&s;elf a little, and was able to look up, he told us he could &s;ee <HI>Sidgate,</HI> which he had not &s;een for many Years before. He could al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h Objects in the Room, and was able to walk home without a Guide. He came a Se|cond
<PB N="45" REF="43">Time, and was &s;o much better, that I ima|gine he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to come any more.</P>
<P N="7">7. He adds, About the Time I wrote la&s;t, a young Woman was cured of a fourteen Years Blindne&s;s. She was able, before &s;he went home, to di&s;tingui&s;h one Letter from another.</P>
<P N="8">8. From the &s;ame Per&s;on, a few Days after|wards, I received the following Lines.</P>
<Q><P>"The Cure of the blind Man of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> has &s;pread thro' all the Country; in con&s;equence of which, I am, much again&s;t my Will, become an Oculi&s;t.</P>
<P>"I have had &s;everal in Hand, and among the re&s;t a Girl, about Seventeen, has been with me about three Weeks. Her Ca&s;e is owing to a Film, or Skin, grown over her Eyes. It came by the Small-pox about twelve Years ago. Her Friends have had all the Advice, and u&s;ed all the Means in their Power, but to no Purpo&s;e; except that &s;he has lo&s;t her Left Eye irrecoverably by one of the Per&s;ons they apply'd to.</P>
<P>"When &s;he came to me, the <HI>Iris</HI> of the Right Eye al&s;o was very near covered with a very thick Skin, &s;o that &s;he could do very little more than di&s;tingui&s;h Day from Night. It was grown much wor&s;e this Winter, and was &s;o Blood-&s;hot and an|gry, that I told her Mother I could do nothing for her. However &s;he made &s;uch a lamentable Complaint, that I con&s;ented to try.</P>
<P>"The Method I have taken, is drawing Sparks from her Eye, and &s;ometimes giving Shocks from her Head or Neck, down her Arm, to carry off the frequent Complaints of Pain and Dizzine&s;s in her Head; which never fails of &s;ucceeding in about ten Minutes. We have electrify'd her about half an Hour twice every Day. The Skin wa&s;tes gradually, and grows thinner and le&s;s every Day;
<PB N="46" REF="44">&s;o that now the Colour of the Eye appears thro' it, except in the Middle, and towards the No&s;e, where the Film at fir&s;t &s;eem'd twice as thick as the re&s;t. The other Day, as I had her under Hand, &s;he &s;aw the Buttons of my Shirt-&s;leeve, and of my Coat; and Ye&s;terday &s;aw the Teeth of one of her Companions that was laughing at her. But her Eye is &s;o weak, that I advi&s;e her to make very little U&s;e of it yet."</P></Q>

<Q><P>"In May 1748, came to me one <HI>Mary Smargins,</HI> born in the I&s;land of <HI>Nevis</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> 28 Years old. She had been &s;o <HI>deaf</HI> (from a Cold at fir&s;t) for &s;eventeen Years, as not to hear any one, unle&s;s they were very near and &s;poke loud. Her Deafne&s;s had no Intervals. She always heard the lea&s;t with the left Ear. On Saturday <HI>May</HI> 28, the Phial being electrified by two Turns of the Wheel only, I applied one Wire to the left Temple, ju&s;t above the Ear, the other to the op|po&s;ite Temple. She felt a &s;mall Warmth in her Head, chiefly from Ear to Ear. I repeated it four Times, a little &s;tronger each Time. The Warmth increa&s;ed at each Shock, and tho' I &s;truck her at each Ear alternately, &s;he always felt mo&s;t Warmth at the deafe&s;t Ear. At la&s;t &s;he complained of &s;mall Twitchings in her Ears, chiefly in that Ear, and cro&s;s her Head. No other Part of her Body felt the Shocks. The Warmth increa&s;ed all Day with Twitchings at Intervals. The next Morning I repeated the Experiments, which then affected her Arms and Body al&s;o. The Twitchings were more violent; the Warmth greater round the Ears, chief|ly the deafer Ear. The&s;e Effects continued all the Day, and &s;he heard con&s;iderably better. But toward Evening, by &s;itting man open Window, &s;he catched Cold; on which the Warmth left her, and &s;he felt very chill all over her Body. On Mon|day &s;he was extremely ill, with Pains all over her. On Tue&s;day &s;he was much better, and felt the &s;ame Kind of Warmth round each Ear again. On Wed|ne&s;day the Noi&s;e and beating in her Head, which &s;he had had from the fir&s;t of her Deafne&s;s, much abated. In the Evening a violent &s;hooting went a-cro&s;s her Head, from the left to the right Ear. On Thur&s;day I repeated the Experiment.

La&s;t Week he began being electrified, and by Sa|turday he was able to put out his Tongue, which before was dead and motionle&s;s. On Monday he could &s;peak a little, and on Tue&s;day he could &s;peak as well as ever.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Dob&s;on,</HI> Leatherpipe-maker, aged 27, living in <HI>Barnaby&s;treet,</HI> was &s;eized with a <HI>Pal&s;y in the Tongue,</HI> on <HI>July</HI> 24th la&s;t. It grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e till Saturday 28, and then quite deprived him of his Speech. He was electrified for five Days, by drawing Sparks from the Tongue, and &s;hocking him all over. And hereby not only his Pal&s;y was cured, but Convul&s;ions al&s;o, which he had had for four Years.</P>
<Q><P>"Mr. <HI>P.</HI> had a Year or two ago a &s;light Touch of a <HI>Pal&s;y.</HI> On a &s;udden his Arm dropped down, quite without Strength; and tho' after chafing it well, he recovered the U&s;e of the upper and mid|dle
<PB N="63" REF="61">Joint, yet the lower Part was &s;till &s;o weak, that he could by no Means write his Name. But by a few Shocks in the Arm he was effectually re|lieved.</P>
<P>"The &s;ame Per&s;on had lately a much wor&s;e Stroke. All his right Side was &s;o affected, that he could not walk without two to &s;upport him. Af|ter he had been electrified three Times, he could walk with the Support of one only, and in a &s;hort Time he was perfectly well." He u&s;ed to &s;tand on the Chain with the right Foot, and touch the Ap|paratus with his right Hand." <BIBL>Mr. <HI>L.</HI></BIBL></P></Q>
<P>I have not yet known any In&s;tance of this Kind. Many <HI>Paralytics</HI> have been helped: But, I think, &s;carce any <HI>Pal&s;y</HI> of a Year &s;tanding has been thro'|ly cured.</P>
<P N="43">43. A Gentlewoman in <HI>London,</HI> who for &s;everal Years was never long together without &s;harp Pains in her Knee, which &s;eemed chiefly <HI>Rheumatical,</HI> was freed from them in a Moment by one &s;ingle Shock.</P>
<P><HI>John Ram&s;ay,</HI> Cabinetmaker, living in the <HI>Strand,</HI> by being very wet, catched a violent Cold, in the latter End of <HI>June</HI> 1756. This occa&s;ioned a <HI>Rheumatic Pain,</HI> which fixed in his left Knee. From this he was &s;eldom free for a Week toge|ther till <HI>November.</HI> He was then very ill till <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> being &s;eldom able to do above half a Day's Work, &s;ometimes none for a Week together. He was for ten Weeks an Out-Patient of <HI>St. George</HI>'s <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pital;</HI> but received no Benefit. On Monday 21&s;t <HI>March</HI> he was electrified thro' the Knee, and four Times more within &s;even Days. The Pain was removed, and his Sleep, which had been long lo&s;t returned, as before he was fir&s;t taken.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Walter,</HI> Servant, aged 22, then living in <HI>Brick-Lane, Spittlefields,</HI> was cured entirely of a
<PB N="64" REF="62">violent <HI>Rheumati&s;m</HI> in her left Arm, by being elec|trified five Times.</P>
<P>A Stone-cutter at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> who&s;e Knees and Joints of his Toes had been rendered &s;tiff, and his Fingers crooked by a Mixture of Gout and <HI>Rheu|mati&s;m,</HI> after being electrified a few Days, was able to go to Work. It has been found to remove or greatly abate all <HI>Rheumatic</HI> Pains.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Cambell,</HI> living in <HI>Queen&s;treet, Seven Dials,</HI> had a &s;evere <HI>Rheumati&s;m</HI> fourteen Weeks. For nine Weeks &s;he could not dre&s;s her&s;elf, nor get out of Bed without Help. She had the Advice of &s;e|veral Phy&s;icians, but in vain. In Spring, 1758, &s;he was electrified five Times, and thereby re&s;tored to full Health.</P>
<P><HI>William Tyler,</HI> living at the <HI>Sun</HI> in <HI>Longlane, Smithfield,</HI> was on <HI>March</HI> 9th la&s;t, about three in the Morning, &s;eized with <HI>Rheumatic Pains,</HI> chiefly on his right Side, &s;o violently, that he was as help|le&s;s as an Infant, and was frequently con&s;trained to &s;hriek out, like a Woman in Labour. I came before Nine. After the &s;econd Shock he felt &s;ome Change: After the third he was able to rai&s;e him|&s;elf a little. After two more he ro&s;e and walked about the Room, and before Noon he was quite ea&s;y and well.</P>
<P><HI>Sarah Guilford,</HI> aged 37, living on <HI>Saffron-hill,</HI> was for upwards of &s;even Years &s;o afflicted with the <HI>Rheuma i&s;m</HI> in her right Side, that the Knee and Ankle were wa&s;ted exceedingly. <HI>January</HI> 2d la&s;t &s;he was electrified, and perfectly cured in one Day. But it threw her into a profu&s;e Sweat, par|ticularly from tho&s;e Parts which had been mo&s;t af|fected.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Cardiff,</HI> Servant, at the <HI>Golden Head, I&s;|lington,</HI> aged 40, about &s;ixteen Years ago, was taken with a violent Rheumati&s;m, by catching Cold in lying in. It returned every Year, and the la&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="63">Winter took away the U&s;e of her Limbs. She followed the Advice of &s;everal Phy&s;icians, till they pronounced her incurable, October 15 la&s;t &s;he was electrified, fir&s;t by general Shocks, then thro' the Parts mo&s;t affected. The fir&s;t and the &s;econd Time it made her extremely weak and faint. The third Time &s;he was better, and after nine Times all her Weakne&s;s and Pains were gone.</P>
<P><HI>Margaret Virgin,</HI> Silk-Winder, aged 39, living in <HI>White-Hor&s;e-Yard, Seethin-Lane,</HI> was troubled with the <HI>Rheumati&s;m</HI> before &s;he was ten Years old, and more and more till when &s;he was about twelve &s;he was confined to her Bed for near 21 Weeks. From that Time &s;he was &s;eldom free from it, &s;o that many Times &s;he was quite inca|pable of Bu&s;ine&s;s. La&s;t Winter &s;he was &s;o ill as to be forced to quit her Work, not being able to lift an Arm to her Head. In <HI>January</HI> &s;he was elec|trified twice: The fir&s;t Time all over: The &s;econd Time thro' the left Arm. The u&s;e of her Arm was immediately re&s;tored. Her Pains entirely left her, and ever &s;ince &s;he has been more capable of any Kind of Work than &s;he had been for twenty Years.</P>
<P><HI>Mary Trumbel,</HI> of <HI>White-Cro&s;s-&s;treet,</HI> aged 49, began to be afflicted with the <HI>Rheumati&s;m</HI> be|fore &s;he was 30 Years of Age. It returned in her Shoulders or Head every Winter: And for the three Winters la&s;t pa&s;t &s;o increa&s;ed, that &s;he could by no Means turn either Arm behind her, and was ex|tremely painful. La&s;t Winter it was wor&s;e than ever. A little before Chri&s;tmas &s;he received five or &s;ix &s;mall Shocks. Immediately &s;he was ea&s;y, recovered the full U&s;e of both Arms, and has re|tained it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><HI>William G.</HI> of the <HI>Little Minories, London,</HI> had been violently afflicted with the Rheumati&s;m for many Years. For &s;everal Winters he was not able
<PB N="66" REF="64">to work. But after having received a few Shocks, in a Quarter of an Hour, all his Complaints vani&s;h|ed away, and he was afterwards as well in Winter as in Summer.</P>
<P N="44">44. Almo&s;t all Kind of <HI>Inflammations, Ring|worms, Tetters, Shingles,</HI> as well as mo&s;t Kinds of <HI>Swellings</HI> may be totally cured by drawing Sparks only.</P>
<P N="45">45. A Lad at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> who had a &s;evere <HI>Scia|tica</HI> in the right Hip, &s;o as not to bear being touch|ed, was cured in a few Days.</P>
<P><HI>John Elli&s;on,</HI> then an Officer of Exci&s;e, liv|ing in <HI>Hunt-&s;treet, Spittlefields,</HI> was upon catching Cold, &s;eized with a violent <HI>Sciatica,</HI> which held him &s;everal Months without Intermi&s;&s;ion, and fre|quently almo&s;t took away the U&s;e of his Limb. In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1754 he was electrified, receiving two Shocks. His Pain raged the more for four or five Hours; but afterwards entirely cea&s;ed. And from that Time to this he has been perfectly well, with|out the lea&s;t Relap&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>"Mr. <HI>R</HI>&mdash; <HI>S</HI>&mdash; of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> troubled with a <HI>Suitica</HI> for &s;ome Years, was cured at once by Shocks conveyed to the Parts affected. <BIBL>Mr. <HI>L.</HI></BIBL></P></Q>
<P><HI>Mary Butler,</HI> aged 86, living in <HI>Eagle&s;treet, Redlien-&s;quare,</HI> having been afflicted with the <HI>Scia|tica</HI> for more than twenty Years, was la&s;t Month electrified ten or twelve Times, and has been ea&s;y ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Electric Fire in Ca&s;es of this and of many other Kinds, dilates the minute Ve&s;&s;els, and capillary Pa&s;&s;ages, as well as &s;eparates the clog|ging Particles of the &s;tagnating Fluids. By acce|lerating likewi&s;e the Motion of the Blood, it re|moves many Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P N="46">46. <HI>Thomas Nevil,</HI> Weaver, aged 26, living at the Bottom of <HI>Vine-Court, Spittlefields;</HI> when about 16 Years of Age, <HI>&s;prained</HI> his Loins &s;o violently,
<PB N="67" REF="65">that from that Time he found a continual Weak|ne&s;s, frequent Pains and an Inability to do any hard Work. On Thur&s;day <HI>March</HI> 10th, 1757, he was electrified, receiving five or &s;ix Shocks thro' the Parts affected. When he went home he felt no Pain, but much Sorene&s;s on the Part, on which a red Spot appeared, like a &s;mall Pin's Head. But the next Morning he was perfectly well, and has been ever &s;ince &s;tronger than before the fir&s;t Hurt.</P>
<P><HI>Francis Halfpenny,</HI> Taylor, aged 30, living in <HI>Redcro&s;s-&s;treet, Southwark,</HI> when about 18 Years old had a Fall from a Tree. By this he received &s;uch a Sprain, that he could not walk twenty Yards, unle&s;s exceeding &s;low, without a gnawing, aking Pain down his Thigh. About the Middle of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> la&s;t he was electrified thro' the upper Part of the Thigh. This was repeated at five or &s;ix dif|ferent Times. The fir&s;t Shock removed the Pain down to the Knee. At the third electrifying it went quite away. And &s;ince that Time he has been full as well as he was before his Fall.</P>
<P N="47">47. </P>
<Q><P><HI>E</HI>&mdash; <HI>H</HI> &mdash; of <HI>Tedny,</HI> had a very painful <HI>&s;wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ing</HI> in the Ball of her great Toe for &s;ome Years. Having made u&s;e of many other Means in vain, &s;he was at length electrified. After the fir&s;t Operation (by drawing Sparks) the Pain was much abated: And in a &s;hort Time the &s;welling di&s;appeared and the Pain left her."</P>
<P>"Mr. <HI>Jo&s;hua W</HI>&mdash; of <HI>Per&s;hore,</HI> was troubled for &s;even or eight Years with a Pain in his &s;econd Toe. Tho' nothing was to be &s;een, it was as ten|der as a Boil, and the Pain was &s;o great, particu|larly in walking, that he at length determined to have it cut off. By drawing Sparks he was cured in an Hour."</P>
<P>"A Gentleman of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> ran a Bodkin into the Side of his Hand, near the fore and middle Fin|gers.
<PB N="68" REF="66">The Wound was no more than the Prick of a large Pin, yet in three or four Days a <HI>&s;wel|ling</HI> came both in the Palm and on the Back of the Hand.</P>
<P>"The fifth Day a Surgeon was called, who for three Months dre&s;&s;ed both the In&s;ide and the Out|&s;ide of the Hand to no Purpo&s;e. A Cau&s;tic was then applied; but with no more Succe&s;s than all the other Means.</P>
<P>"Finding no Alteration, nor Likelyhood of any, he was electrified twice (by drawing off Sparks) on the In&s;ide of his Hand, at the Bottom of the middle Finger. In four Days it broke, and in about three Weeks healed. <BIBL>Mr. <HI>L.</HI></BIBL></P></Q>
<P><HI>Jane Davi&s;on,</HI> Quilter, aged 26, living in <HI>Qua|ker &s;treet,</HI> had about &s;ix Years ago a violent Tooth-ach, which occa&s;ioned a <HI>&s;welling</HI> in her right Cheek. This continued gradually increa&s;ing on the In&s;ide of the Cheek, till it grew into an hard fle&s;hy Lump. De&s;pairing of any Help, &s;he let it alone, till la&s;t Month &s;he was per&s;uaded to be electrified. She re|ceived &s;everal &s;trong Shocks thro' the Part. After this was done the fir&s;t Time, the &s;welling not on|ly increa&s;ed exceedingly, but was violently painful. The next Day, the other Cheek likewi&s;e &s;welled, and that &s;welling &s;pread thro' the upper Lip, acro&s;s the Mouth. Neverthele&s;s &s;he was electrified again. Two or three Days after it broke, and for two Days together, di&s;charged abundance of purulent Matter mixt with Blood. But in a few Days the Wound was intirely healed, and all the &s;welling gone.</P>
<P N="48">48. <Q>"<HI>E</HI>&mdash; <HI>T</HI>&mdash; taking cold, was &s;eized with a <HI>&s;ore Throat,</HI> which grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e for &s;ix Days. She then could not &s;wallow even a Bit of Bread &s;oaked in Tea. The &s;ame Morning &s;he was electrified, &s;o as to direct the Shock in a right Line thro' the Part affected. By the Time &s;he got home
<PB N="69" REF="67">&s;he could eat any Thing. Two Shocks more made a perfect Cure."</Q></P>
<P N="49">49. </P>
<Q><P>"The <HI>Tooth-ach,</HI> if proceeding from a &s;cor|butic Habit, from hollow Teeth, or from a De|fluxion of Rheum, is pre&s;ently a&s;&s;uaged or totally removed by this Remedy.</P>
<P>"This may frequently be done by drawing Sparks from the Tooth or Check: In mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;tub|born Ca&s;es, by moderate Shocks. The &s;ooner you touch the Phial, the weaker the Shock: So that you may le&s;&s;en or increa&s;e it at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"In giving the Shock the mo&s;t effectual Way, is, to bring one Wire under the Chin and Tooth, (if it be on the under Side) and lay the End of the other Wire on the Top of the Tooth. If it be on the upper Side, bring one Wire to the Top of the Head over the Tooth, and apply the other to the Bottom of it. <BIBL>Mr. <HI>L.</HI></BIBL></P></Q>
<P><HI>Sarah Elli&s;on,</HI> the Wi&s;e of <HI>John Ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on</HI> abovementioned, catched Cold in lying in, which fixed a &s;harp <HI>Pain</HI> in her <HI>Teeth,</HI> and the Side of her Face. She u&s;ed all Manner of Means to remove this for upwards of &s;ix Years. Among many others &s;he had at &s;everal Times, three Teeth draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, and was fourteen Times bli&s;tered, but without Ef|fect. In <HI>July</HI> 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">4, &s;he received &s;ix Shocks thro' her Head. The Pain cea&s;ed immediately, and re|turned no more.</P>
<P N="50">50 </P>
<Q><P>"A P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;on had a &s;welling, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>Wen,</HI> between the Neck and the Shoulder-Blade as big as an Egg, and nearly as hard, which had been growing to that Size for &s;everal Years. She had not been electrified many Times (by drawing Sparks for five or &s;ix minutes every Day) before it began to &s;often. Soon after it di&s;charged a thin Humour thro' a &s;mall Orifice, and continued di&s;charging and &s;oftening more and more, till it was entirely di&s;&s;i|pated." <BIBL>Mr. <HI>L.</HI></BIBL></P></Q>
<PB N="70" REF="68">
<P N="51">51. Whoever de&s;ires to &s;ee a more circum|&s;tantial Account of many of the preceeding Ca&s;es, with the Names of mo&s;t of the Patients and their Places of Abode, may con&s;ult Mr. <HI>Lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tt</HI>'s Treati&s;e. It is wrote not only with admirable Judgment, but with an excellent Spirit. A Prin|ciple of Benevolence to Human Kind may be ea&s;i|ly ob&s;erved to breathe thro' the whole: Nor can any lightly condemn it, but tho&s;e who&s;e Intere&s;t natur|ally leads them to decry whatever would le&s;&s;en their own Gain.</P>
<P N="52">52. After relating the&s;e Cures, Mr. <HI>L.</HI> him&s;elf adds, "I can't deny but I was much a&s;toni&s;hed, at &s;eeing &s;uch mighty Things performed by Electri|city. But after having attentively con&s;idered the Nature of Electric Ether, its great Subtilty and Power, its active and enlivening Qualities, and its mighty Tendency to accelerate the Motion of the Fluids in general, and of the Blood in particular:" (I would add, and to pervade the fine&s;t Arteries and Nerves, to dilate their ob&s;tructed or contracted Ori|fices; as well as to re&s;tore the Tone of any Mu&s;cle or Fibre, which is either impaired or de&s;troyed:) "I concluded that all tho&s;e &s;urprizing Effects were no more than the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of &s;o powerful an Agent, when thus determined, and di|rected. And the helping us in our bodily Infirmi|ties, was <HI>one</HI> great End it was ordained to &s;erve," (probably <HI>the</HI> great End) "after it had been thus fully and plainly di&s;covered to us."</P>
<P N="53">53. It were greatly to be wi&s;hed, that the Gentle|men of the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ulty would &s;trictly examine the Na|ture, Properties, and Effects of this &s;overeign Re|medy. For &s;uch it unque&s;tionably is, particularly in nervous Ca&s;es: Even in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, which the common <HI>Materia Medica</HI> will in no wi&s;e reach. But it is not to be expected. They mu&s;t not di&s;o|blige their good Friends the Apothecaries. Neither
<PB N="71" REF="69">can it con&s;i&s;t with their own Intere&s;t, to make (al|tho' not every Man) yet &s;o many Men their own Phy&s;icians, which would be the unavoidable Con&s;e|quence, if a regular Sy&s;tem of practical Rules were formed from a Proce&s;s of Experiments, whereby a &s;en&s;ible Man might judge in what Ca&s;es it would cure, and in what not: And in what Manner it might be mo&s;t effectually applied in any Ca&s;e wherein it was proper.</P>
<P>In order to prevent any ill Effect, the&s;e two Cautions &s;hould always be remembered. Fir&s;t, let not the Shock be too violent; rather let &s;everal &s;mall Shocks be given. Secondly, do not give a Shock to the whole Body, when only a particular Part is affected. If it be given to the Part affected only, little Harm can follow even from a violent Shock.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance. In a <HI>Pal&s;y of the Tongue,</HI> the Shock may be given to the Tongue only by applying one Wire to the hinder Part of the Neck, and another to the Tongue. And if in any Ca&s;e there be Dan|ger of too great a Shock, it may ea&s;ily be pre|vented.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, a timely u&s;e of this Means might prevent before they were thro'ly formed, and frequently even then remove &s;ome of the mo&s;t pain|ful and dangerous Di&s;tempers: <HI>Cancers</HI> and <HI>&s;crophu|lous Tumours</HI> in particular; tho' they will yield to no other Medicine yet di&s;covered. It is certain, nothing is &s;o likely, by accelerating the contained Fluids, to dilate and open the Pa&s;&s;ages, as well as divide the coagulated Particles of the Blood, that &s;o the Circulation may be again performed. And it is a Doubt, whether it would not be of more u&s;e, even in <HI>Mortifications,</HI> than either the Bark or any other Medicine.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would beg one Thing (if it be not too great a Favour) from the Gentlemen of the Faculty, and indeed from all who de&s;ire
<PB N="72" REF="70">Health and Freedom from Pain, either for them&s;elves or their Neighbours. It is, That none of them would condemn they know not what: That they would hear the Cau&s;e, before they pa&s;s Sentence: That they would not peremptorily pronounce again&s;t Electricity, while they know little or nothing about it. Rather let every candid Man take a little Pains, to under&s;tand the Que&s;tion before he determines it. Let him for two or three Weeks (at lea&s;t) try it him&s;elf in the above-named Di&s;orders. And then his own Sen&s;es will &s;hew him, whether it is a mere Play-thing, or the noble&s;t Medicine yet known in the World.</P>
