<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS Ruptures are di&s;orders, on which, very prepo&s;terou&s;ly, a character of di&s;|grace has been fa&s;tened, &s;o almo&s;t all tho&s;e of our &s;ex, who labour under them, imagine the&s;e infirmities to be a &s;tain to their honour; they fix upon them a kind of ignominy, which is the rea&s;on, that in&s;tead of having recour&s;e to the remedies proper for them, they would, by a mi&s;placed &s;hame, di&s;&s;emble them to others, and even conceal from them&s;elves the know|ledge of the danger they are in.</P>
<P>We &s;hall find this delicacy to be quite out of place, if we con&s;ider, that the&s;e di&s;orders are the mo&s;t com|mon of all tho&s;e afflicting human bodies; that they are the growth of every country, the fate of every age,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">and of every condition in life, and that they hap|pen through cau&s;es much more &s;imple and innocent, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e producing the other di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>'Tis through the conviction of this truth, that per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, who have deigned to own their mi&s;take on this head, have prevailed upon me to publi&s;h the following in&s;tructions. Their pur|po&s;e was, that all per&s;ons afflicted, as they were, might learn to lay a&s;ide their prejudices, and &s;et about to procure for them&s;elves the means of aid the&s;e di&s;orders call for.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of my life put me in a capacity of acquitting my&s;elf of this duty, with all the preci&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to a work of this nature: Born in the bo&s;om of &s;urgery, and brought up under the in&s;tructions of Mr. <HI>Arnaud,</HI> author of the treati&s;e on the&s;e di&s;tempers, publi&s;hed not long &s;ince, I have been enabled (tho' the only one of my &s;ex) to merit the honour of being admitted into the number of the &s;urgeons of <HI>Paris,</HI> for the treatment of Ruptures in women. Some per&s;ons, jealous of my talents, do indeed di&s;pute me this privilege, and attempt to mi&s;guide the public on my &s;core; but the patent, or letters of my Reception, &s;ubjoined to this preface, mu&s;t defeat all &s;uch &s;urmi&s;es, in ju&s;tifying my title to that honour.</P>
<P>To come up fully to my engagements, I propo&s;e, in the&s;e in&s;tructions, to put per&s;ons of my &s;ex on their guard again&s;t the untoward &s;ymptoms attending ruptures. The&s;e di&s;orders, which are &s;o many con|cealed
<PB N="v" REF="4">enemies, becau&s;e unknown, will no &s;ooner be di&s;covered than be de&s;troyed. Each patient will be in condition, upon reading this di&s;&s;ertation with a &s;mall degree of attention, to become acquainted with the&s;e maladies, and their cure: No longer &s;hall any one be able to alledge her want of knowledge for excu&s;e; nor any longer be re&s;trained, by rea&s;ons of decency or mode&s;ty, on a conviction of our under|&s;tanding in the&s;e kinds of di&s;orders.</P>
<P>All the views of the per&s;ons, for whom I write, are here fully an&s;wered, in the order I ob&s;erve for their in&s;truction. I &s;et out with the notion of Rup|tures in general; then I enter upon a particular detail of each of the&s;e di&s;orders: I de&s;cribe the parts where they are formed, in proportion as I come to &s;peak to the differences of the&s;e di&s;tempers: I ex|plain their cau&s;es, their &s;ymptoms and &s;igns; &s;o that, with a glance of the eye, the female reader may be|come acquainted with each particular ca&s;e. <HI>Finally,</HI> I come to &s;peak to the means of effecting a radical cure upon them. And, among all the means, ban|dages or tru&s;&s;es being the mo&s;t common and mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I enlarge, as much as po&s;&s;ible, on the man|ner of making and adju&s;ting them to the body of the patient. I lay down the nece&s;&s;ary rules for taking the proper mea&s;ures of the body, in order to execute them well, and I point at the inconveniencies which &s;ome have oppo&s;ed to the u&s;e of the&s;e machines: And every one not being in ca&s;e of having the nece&s;&s;ary relief again&s;t the &s;trangulation of the gut, each
<PB N="vi" REF="5">female patient will here find the mo&s;t efficacious remedies, and ea&s;y of execution, that can po&s;&s;ibly be employed again&s;t that &s;ymptom, and by their means may remove it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have avoided, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the u&s;e of the terms of art, which are always uncouth to per&s;ons not of the profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ub&s;tituted in their &s;tead tho&s;e of a more familiar and common u&s;e.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of Ruptures in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE DESIGN OF THE WORK._THE intention, which I have of giving in&s;truc|tions to per&s;ons of my own &s;ex afflicted with Ruptures, nece&s;&s;arily obliges me to engage in &s;ome de|tail upon the character of the&s;e di&s;orders, their differ|ences, their cau&s;es, their &s;igns, and their &s;ymptoms, in order to arrive at the knowlege of the means proper to guard again&s;t, or cure them.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="11">
<P>WHAT A RUPTURE IS. Ruptures are tumours or &s;wellings formed by the i&s;&s;uing forth of certain parts contained in the belly.</P>
<P>They are &s;o called, becau&s;e there is produced a kind or divi&s;ion or &s;eparation of &s;ome of the parts of the belly, which &s;erve to contain the caul, the guts, the liver, the &s;pleen, the &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e parts, which &s;eparate of divide, are called the mu&s;cles, and the&s;e have five natural apertures or openings, which &s;erve to give exit or i&s;&s;ue from the belly to certain nece&s;&s;ary parts. Of the&s;e openings I &s;hall &s;peak in the follow|ing chapter.</P>
<P>DIVISION OF RUPTURES. Ruptures are divid|ed into true and fal&s;e.</P>
<P>TRUE. The true Ruptures are tho&s;e formed by the coming forth of tho&s;e parts contained in the lower belly.</P>
<P>FALSE. The fal&s;e Ruptures are tumours or &s;well|ings formed by the collection of the blood, the lym|pha, or other humours, in the parts where the true Ruptures happen.</P>
<P>DISTINCTION OF RUPTURES. Ruptures are di|&s;tingui&s;hed according to the parts of which they con|&s;i&s;t, and the places they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES. They differ among them&s;elves on the &s;core of the parts of which they con|&s;i&s;t; in that &s;ome are formed by the guts; others by the caul; and others, again, by the guts and the caul together.</P>
<P>UNCOMMON RUPTURES. There are al&s;o &s;ome Ruptures formed by the &s;tomach, the bladder (which happens, rarely); others by the ovaries, and the womb pa&s;&s;ing thro' the openings, in the bending of the groin; but the&s;e &s;orts of Ruptures happen &s;till more rarely: and &s;o, without in&s;i&s;ting on a particular detail of them, which would throw confu&s;ion into the di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall
<PB N="3" REF="12">only mention tho&s;e produced by the gut and the caul; to which I &s;hall add tho&s;e of the womb, and the fall|ing of the fundament.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES OF TRUE RUPTURES. The true Ruptures differ among them&s;elves, from the places they po&s;&s;e&s;s; in that &s;ome happen in the navel; and the&s;e are therefore called <HI>umbilical hernia's,</HI> or Rup|tures of the navel: Others in the groin, and the&s;e are called inguinal: Others, in the bending of the thighs, and called crural: Others, again, are formed in differ|ent parts of the &s;urface of the belly, and called ven|tral, or Ruptures of the belly.</P>
<P>There are, be&s;ides, other Ruptures which happen in other parts, and which, for that rea&s;on, differ from the&s;e others; as &s;ome happen in the loins, others in the vagina; others, again, which are formed at the holes at the bottom of the haunch-bones; but I &s;hall wave &s;peaking of all the&s;e different &s;orts of Rup|tures, as they happen but very rarely, to engage our attention here; the&s;e extraordinary ca&s;es claiming only the attention of the people of the art or profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the general cau&s;es of Ruptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT A CAUSE IS. PHYSICIANS call cau&s;es of di&s;|ea&s;es every affection again&s;t nature, which produces, or which concurs to produce, di&s;|ea&s;es. The cau&s;es of Ruptures are divided into remoter or primitive, and into proximate or determining.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="13">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="3" REF="14">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="4" REF="15">
<P>REMOTE CAUSES. The remote cau&s;es are tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from the temperament or con&s;titution, which the patients bring with them into the world, or from the di&s;po&s;ition they acquire by their manner of living. It is not to be doubted, but that children ordina|rily enough inherit the good or bad qualities of the &s;oul and body of their parents; &s;o that there is nothing more certain, than that robu&s;t parents predate &s;trong and vigorous children; and the delicate, children of the like delicacy of con&s;titution with them&s;elves; the gouty, gouty; and die phthi&s;ical, phthi&s;ical, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And tho&s;e who have Ruptures commonly enough children with the like indi&s;po&s;itions with them&s;elves; con&s;equently the mo&s;t remote cau&s;es of Ruptures may be traced up to the di&s;po&s;ition which is communicated to the child at the moment of its conception.</P>
<P>PRIMITIVE CAUSES, WHENCE THEY MOST COM|MONLY PROCEED. It is much more common to find the primitive or remote cau&s;es of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in the manner of living. All the parts which are contained in the belly, and all tho&s;e which form it, are naturally &s;often|ed and relaxed by the too moi&s;t air which is re&s;pired; by the mar&s;hy places which are inhabited; by the too relaxing aliments that are u&s;ed, as the too thin milk of a nur&s;e of a bad con&s;titution; by the oil, the butter, the too great quantity of water, &s;mall-beer, and other the like drinks.</P>
<P>DETERMINING CAUSES. Every thing that is ca|pable of determining the parts, already relaxed, to come forth, is con&s;idered as immediate cau&s;es of the&s;e di&s;orders. Loud crying, leaping, &s;training, con&s;tipation, pregnancy, and child-bearing, force the parts contained in the belly to &s;tretch, and come out at tho&s;e places where they happen to find the lea&s;t degree of re&s;i&s;t|ence.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="16">
<P>NATURAL OPENINGS. In the belly there are five natural openings; but which are neither apparent, nor even &s;urmi&s;ed to be there, by per&s;ons unacquainted with anatomy; becau&s;e, like all the other parts, they are co|vered by the &s;kin and fat. Of the&s;e five openings the navel is the fir&s;t; two others are &s;ituated in the groin, and called <HI>rings;</HI> two others in the bendings of the thighs, and called <HI>arcades</HI> or <HI>archs.</HI> The&s;e openings, in their natural &s;tate, are exactly filled by other parts, which are de&s;tined to come forth of the belly. In the hole of the navel are the remains of the navel-&s;tring, which, during the time the child is in the body of the mother, &s;erves to convey nouri&s;hment to it. Thro' the rings pa&s;s two &s;orts of &s;trings, which &s;erve to &s;upport the womb, and are called the round ligaments of the womb. Below each of the arcades pa&s;s the ve&s;&s;els, which carry the blood for nouri&s;hing the inferior ex|tremity.</P>
<P>PRETERNATURAL OPENINGS. Be&s;ides the natu|ral openings, thro' which the parts contained in the belly may come out, there are, be&s;ides, others very often formed in all the anterior &s;urface of the belly; becau&s;e the parts, which are under the &s;kin and the fat, called mu&s;cles, and which &s;erve to form the belly, are &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;eparations and divi&s;ions, which let out the caul and the guts. Be&s;ides the mu&s;cles, there is another part, which immediately covers all tho&s;e con|tain'd in the belly; this part is called the <HI>peritoneum.</HI> This peritoneum does not divide; but is capable of being extended and lengthened con&s;iderably, tho' of a very delicate texture, its thickne&s;s re&s;embling nearly that of a hog's bladder; it always forms a part of the Rupture, and &s;erves as a covering to the guts, when out of the belly, in the &s;ame manner as in it. It is
<PB N="6" REF="17">called the herniary &s;ac, when out of the belly; an appellation very &s;ignificant, &s;ince it &s;erves as a &s;ac to contain the Rupture.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATE OR DETERMINING CAUSES. In or|der to find the immediate cau&s;es of hernia's or Ruptures, and at the &s;ame time guard again&s;t them, it &s;ufficeth to attend to the general idea, which we have ju&s;t now formed from the natural openings in the belly, and from tho&s;e which may be produced therein in an extra|ordinary manner, by the &s;eparation of the mu&s;cles. When the fir&s;t or primitive cau&s;es have brought the parts contained in the belly to a &s;tate of relaxation, by the great quantity of moi&s;ture communicated to the blood by the natural con&s;titution, by the method of living, or by the air re&s;pired, how incon&s;iderable &s;oever the efforts or &s;trainings happen to be, the guts will be di&s;po&s;ed to make their way out of the belly by the parts, where they find the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tence. Now, as they find le&s;s at the natural openings, or in the parts di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eparate, they will not fail to come out of the belly at the&s;e places, and form one or &s;everal Rup|tures, according to the greater or le&s;s degree of re&s;i&s;t|ence they meet with in any of tho&s;e parts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the &s;igns of true hernia's.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT A SIGN IS. THE &s;igns in di&s;ea&s;es are &s;en&s;ible marks, which di&s;cover, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h them from each other. Some of them di&s;cover the pre&s;ent &s;tate, the character, and the &s;pecies of the
<PB N="7" REF="18">di&s;ea&s;e; and they are called diagno&s;tic. Others again enable us to judge of the i&s;&s;ue of a di&s;ea&s;e; and the&s;e are called progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS OF RUPTURES. The dia|gno&s;tic &s;igns, common to all true hernia's or Ruptures, differ according to the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. When the Rupture is ju&s;t about forming, the patient feels a &s;mall pain, like that of an excoriation, or ruffling of the &s;kin, and that within the belly; when the Rupture encrea&s;es, the patient perceives, on applying the hand, a &s;mall &s;welling, which di&s;appears upon pre&s;&s;ing with the finger: When entirely formed, collical pains are from time to time felt in the part of the Rupture, and which extend to the parts about the navel. The dia|gno&s;tic &s;igns, common to all the &s;pecies of true her|nia's, do, be&s;ides, di&s;cover what parts they con&s;i&s;t of, whether of the gut or caul, or of both together. Tho&s;e con&s;i&s;ting of the gut are known by a &s;mall rum|bling noi&s;e cau&s;ed by the wind and the fluid matters con|tained in the gut, which rumbling is heard, e&s;pecially, upon handling the Rupture, in order to procure its return.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e formed of the caul di&s;cover them&s;elves, upon the touch, by a doughy re&s;i&s;tance, like what we feel, when we come to handle a piece of tripe. In tho&s;e formed of the gut and caul together, the&s;e &s;igns are mixt, that is to &s;ay, they are found combined.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS OF RUPTURES. In regard to progno&s;tic &s;igns, it may be &s;aid, in general, that Ruptures are very trouble&s;ome di&s;orders, when they are neglected, and come to be atttended with &s;ym|ptoms: Tho&s;e formed of the gut are more dangerous than tho&s;e formed of the caul; tho&s;e happening in the navel and belly, more difficult to cure than tho&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="19">called inguinal; and tho&s;e happening in the bending of the thigh, are, of all, the mo&s;t difficult of cure.</P>
<P>The hernia's of the womb are, in general, more trouble&s;ome than dangerous.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the fundament, called the falling of the fundament, are the lea&s;t dangerous; but the mo&s;t dif|ficult to cure.</P>
<P>In fine, all of them are &s;o much the more difficult to cure, as they are of an older &s;tanding; con&s;equent|ly le&s;s &s;o in children.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the &s;ymptoms of Ruptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT A SYM|PTOM IS. EVERY thing that &s;upervenes or happens upon a di&s;ea&s;e, and renders it more grievous, is called a &s;ymptom; as, for in&s;tance, a flux of blood coming upon a loo&s;ene&s;s, a dalirium upon a fever, and the like.</P>
<P>STRANGULATION. Of all the &s;ymptoms of Rup|tures, that of the &s;trangulation is the mo&s;t formidable and dangerous, and again&s;t which patients &s;hould be mo&s;t on their guard, either in preventing it, or &s;eek|ing out the means of cure, and u&s;ing them in&s;tantly upon this &s;ymptom; never &s;o little neglected, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the experte&s;t &s;urgeon to remedy it. The death of the late queen is too &s;en&s;ible an in&s;tance of this truth, not to be capable of &s;triking every pa|tient; for who could procure better means of a&s;&s;i&s;tance than &s;he upon this melancholy occa&s;ion?</P>
<PB N="9" REF="20">
<P>WHAT STRANGULATION IS. By &s;trangulation we under&s;tand a degree of &s;traitening, which hap|pens thro' the &s;trong compre&s;&s;ion of the parts tho' which the gut pa&s;&s;es, and which no longer &s;uffer it to return into the belly. In this ca&s;e, then, the gut is &s;trangled, and this &s;trangulation cannot happen with|out two other &s;ymptoms extremely ea&s;y to be under|&s;tood; the fir&s;t is an inflammation and gangrene; the &s;econd, an impediment to the pa&s;&s;age of the feces into the gut; from whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the feces mu&s;t return by the mouth, by throwing them up, if the return of the gut into the belly be not procured, for the feces to take their ordinary cour&s;e by the fundament.</P>
<P>Tho' &s;omeimes it happens, that it is not above five or &s;ix hours before the feces return by the mouth; yet this is not &s;o commonly the ca&s;e: The vomiting comes on for the mo&s;t part on the 3d or 4th day; &s;ometimes not till after 8, 9 and 10 days; but the patients are afflicted with &s;uch &s;ymptoms, as by pre|ceeding the vomiting, anounce and characterize the &s;trangulation of the gut &s;o di&s;tinctly, that every one who will but attend, can never mi&s;take the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Here follows the detail of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>FIRST, The Rupture grows bigger than ordinary.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Cau&s;es much pain.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Baffles all attempts to reduce it.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, The pain extends as far as round the navel, if the Rupture be in the bending of the thigh; if in the navel, the pain, beginning there, ex|tends to the groin.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="21">
<P>FIFTHLY, The pains called gripes hold only for &s;ome minutes; but recur from time to time, and the di&s;order they cau&s;e, is daily increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>SIXTHLY, Upon the&s;e gripings comes wind, which is plentifully di&s;charged at the mouth; the patient can|not di&s;charge it by the fundament, notwith&s;tanding all the inclination &s;he &s;eems to have to do it by that part.</P>
<P>SEVENTHLY, The patient is troubled with loath|ings, or an inclination to vomit, which terminate in a plentiful &s;alivation, thick and glutinous.</P>
<P>EIGHTHLY, At la&s;t the patient throws up the ali|ments, then, come the feces, whole ta&s;te and &s;mell are extremely nau&s;eous.</P>
<P>During the &s;eries and increa&s;e of the &s;ymptoms, the Rupture &s;wells, the belly turns hard, and very big, a fever comes on, and heightens more and more.</P>
<P>But, on the clo&s;e of the di&s;temper, the vomitings &s;lacken, the patient is afflicted with hiccups, the bel|ly &s;ub&s;ides, and becomes in&s;en&s;ible, the Rupture turns &s;oft and livid; the &s;ight fails; the pul&s;e turns inter|mitting and langui&s;hing, at length is totally lo&s;t, and the patient dies for want of having fore&s;een the means of guarding again&s;t a death &s;he might have a|voided.</P>
<P>ADHESIONS. Ruptures are, be&s;ides, &s;ubject to another &s;ymptom, called adhe&s;ion; 'tis an union, which is made between the parts coming out of the belly, and tho&s;e without it, as the fat and &s;kin; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The parts which are attached externally, can no longer return into the belly.</P>
<P>But how &s;hould we avoid a danger unknown, how guard again&s;t the&s;e &s;ymptoms, if we are unin&s;tructed
<PB N="11" REF="22">about them? Po&s;&s;ibly 'tis only by reading; and to ren|der it the more u&s;eful, I propo&s;e to de&s;cribe each &s;pe|cies of Rupture in particular; after which I &s;hall communicate the means to guard again&s;t, and remedy them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Ruptures of the navel.</HEAD>
<P>EXPLANATION OF THE PART. THE navel, as I have already hinted, is a hole de&s;tined to give pa&s;&s;age into the belly of the infant, during its &s;tay in the body of the mother, to what we call the navel-&s;tring. It con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;orts of ve&s;&s;els; name|ly, a vein, two arteries, and a canal called urachus: This &s;tring is a continuation of the ve&s;&s;els which form the after-birth, which after-birth is attached to the bot|tom of the womb. By means of the vein, which is a part of this &s;tring, the blood is conveyed from the mother to the child, for its nouri&s;hment and growth; and the blood returned back to the mother by the inter|vention of the two arteries.</P>
<P>The urachus is a canal coming from the bladder of the child, for relieving it of the urine, by conveying it into the blood of the mother. When the child comes to the world, this &s;tring is tied up with a thread, and cut, to prevent the flux of the blood of the child; &s;o that the hole of the navel is filled by the navel-&s;tring, yet imperfectly enough, as it afterwards comes to &s;hri|vel and dry.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="23">
<P>CHARACTER OF THE DISEASE. When we hap|pen at any time to &s;train much, the gut or the caul ea&s;ily comes out at the hole of the navel, becau&s;e there a le&s;s, degree of re&s;i&s;tence is found than any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES AND CAUSES. The Ruptures of the navel are not only formed at the hole it&s;elf of the navel, but &s;ome more commonly happen at the cir|cumference of this hole, becau&s;e the&s;e parts are very weak, and ea&s;ily dilate by any violent efforts, or gentler efforts often reiterated. Women are very &s;ubject to this &s;pecies of Rupture. The rea&s;on is, that, in pregnancy, the belly is extremely extended, the hole of the navel enlarged more than in the natural &s;tate, or that its circumference yields and gives way more ea&s;ily than all the other parts; becau&s;e, as was &s;aid, the cir|cumference of the navel is weaker than the navel it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The &s;welling and elevation of this part is the characteri&s;tical mark of the Rupture, e&s;pecially if this &s;welling di&s;appears when abed, or when pre&s;&s;ed with the fingers.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. In general this &s;pecies of Ruptures is very difficult to cure: The &s;mall ones, and recent, are more dangerous than tho&s;e of a longer &s;tanding; but the&s;e of a longer &s;tanding are of more difficult cure. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are very dangerous in children; but more ea&s;ily cured than in per&s;ons of an advanced age.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS. The Symptoms of the Ruptures of the navel are the &s;ame, in general, with tho&s;e in all the other &s;pecies of hernias. One, peculiar to and common in them, is a &s;pecies of &s;light colic, le&s;s painful than trouble&s;ome, which the patients are in|ce&s;&s;antly
<PB N="13" REF="24">afflicted with when up, and which encrea&s;es after eating.</P>
<P>CURE. The Art of &s;urgery &s;upplies three different means of cure for this &s;pecies of Rupture. The fir&s;t is what is called the palliative: The &s;econd, the radi|cal; and the third, is the means of remedying the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE PALLIATIVE CURE is that by means of which we only attempt to prevent the &s;ymptoms, by keeping the parts in the belly by bandages or tru&s;&s;es, which ex|actly clo&s;e up the hole, at which the parts come out, and hinder their coming out when once returned into the belly. This method of cure &s;uits the hernias, ac|companied with inconveniencies, which oppo&s;e their radical cure, as tho&s;e of too old a &s;tanding, tho&s;e of too con&s;iderable a bulk, and tho&s;e happening to women who are &s;ubject to have children.</P>
<P>THE RADICAL CURE is that by which Ruptures are cured by the remedies proper in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; of which I &s;hall &s;peak in chap. xiv; as in chap. ix. of the means of removing the &s;ymptoms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Rupture of the groin.</HEAD>
<P>EXPLANATION OF THE PART. THE Author of nature has &s;o di&s;po&s;ed the belly, that there are two holes, which an&s;wer to the parts, called the groin. The&s;e holes are de&s;tined to give pa&s;&s;age from the belly on each &s;ide in women to a &s;pecies of round &s;tring, called from its figure, the round ligament of the
<PB N="14" REF="25">womb; it &s;erves to keep that part in its place. The holes, thro' which the&s;e ligaments pa&s;s, are, from their figure, which is nearly round, called rings. In the natural &s;tate, the&s;e holes are filled by the parts which pa&s;s thro' them; but, upon violent &s;trainings, they enlarge gradually, and at la&s;t give pa&s;&s;age to the gut or caul, or to both together, out of the belly, and &s;uffer them to form the Ruptures of the groin; they are called inguinal hernias or Ruptures.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES. The hernias of the groin are differ|ent, and have different appellations according to the place they occupy. Some remain in the bending of the groin; the&s;e they call incompleat: Others de|&s;cend to the great lip of the natural parts; and the&s;e are called compleat.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The particular cau&s;e of inguinal hernias proceeds from the rings being &s;ituated in the lowe&s;t part of the belly, which are continually relaxed by a certain quantity of water found at the bottom of the belly: If then the determining cau&s;es come to act, the&s;e parte being naturally open, and &s;ituated in the lowe&s;t part of the belly, the guts or the caul in&s;inuate ea&s;ily into them.</P>
<P>The determining cau&s;es are, loud crying, leaping, the &s;trainings made to cough, at &s;tool, in child-bed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The neglect of remedying the incompleat Rupture of the groin is the mo&s;t immediate cau&s;e of the com|pleat Rupture; for if its progre&s;s be not &s;topp'd by bandages, it is natural to think that it mu&s;t daily en|crea&s;e more and more, and arrive at that pitch, that all the guts &s;hall come down to the great lip. Nothing is more common than &s;uch &s;orts of Ruptures. They
<PB N="15" REF="26">are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved of the bigne&s;s of one's head, and hanging down to the thighs.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS. The parts which ought to continue in the belly, which is their natural place, cannot be thus di&s;arrang'd, without this con&s;equence, a con&s;iderable di&s;order in the &s;tate of the health; for the guts cannot come down &s;o low, and the &s;tomach at the &s;ame time not be pulled down and di&s;placed. As the guts are a continuation of the &s;tomach, it then but imperfectly performs the dige&s;tion of the aliments; the patients are afflicted with windy colicks; the twitchings, to which the guts, the &s;tomach, and other parts contained in the belly, are &s;ubject, cau&s;e almo&s;t continual weakne&s;&s;es, which are improperly a&s;cribed to the cravings of hunger.</P>
<P>It rarely happens, that the&s;e large hernias are &s;ub|ject to &s;trangulation; but &s;hould that happen, it is ever with the mo&s;t imminent danger.</P>
<P>The incompleat hernias are rarely &s;ubject to the &s;ymptoms above de&s;cribed, yet more than the others &s;ub|ject to &s;trangulation; becau&s;e the rings, not having lo&s;t their &s;pring, as in the compleat hernias, are more in ca&s;e to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the parts, and hinder their return, which con&s;titutes the &s;trangulation. It is, be&s;ides, true, that it is ea&s;ier to guard again&s;t their &s;trangulation, becau&s;e ea&s;ier to keep them in with ban|dages or tru&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The incompleat hernia of the groin is di&s;tingui&s;h'd by its facility of coming our and returning again, when not adherent, and by the &s;igns of the compleat hernia.</P>
<P>The compleat hernia is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by its fa|cility of returning again, when not adherent: If adhe|rent, that is, if attach'd to the exterior parts, and form|ed
<PB N="16" REF="27">of the gut, we feel in it a certain degree of flexibi|lity, like that which is felt on compre&s;&s;ing a bladder not quite full of water: If the hernia be formed of the caul, on the touch we perceive a &s;oftne&s;s, like that we feel in handling a piece of tripe. If the hernia con&s;i&s;ts of both the&s;e parts, the &s;igns are then mixt; we feel, in handling the tumour, that flexibility, and at the &s;ame time, that &s;oftne&s;s ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. We may affirm of the hernias or Ruptures of the groin, that the incompleat are more dangerous than the compleat, and al&s;o of more ea&s;y cure; for in the compleat, the di&s;arrangement of the parts is more con&s;iderable; but the hole of the ring be|ing larger, they are le&s;s &s;ubject to &s;trangulation.</P>
<P>CURE. The hernias of the groin are &s;u&s;ceptible of three different methods of cure; of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter, <HI>viz.</HI> the palliative, the radical, and of that which con&s;i&s;ts in removing their &s;ymptoms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the crural hernia.</HEAD>
<P>EXPLANATION OF THE PART. IN the bending of the thigh, ju&s;t in the middle, under the &s;kin and the fat, there is an opening to one &s;ide of the ring; this opening, which is called the crural arcade, has in effect nearly the figure of a &s;mall arcade or arch. It &s;erves to give pa&s;&s;age out of the belly to the ve&s;&s;els which carry the blood for the nouri&s;hment of the thigh, the leg, and the foot, and to tho&s;e which reconvey it from
<PB N="17" REF="28">the&s;e parts. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are called crural, and the rupture made by this hole is al&s;o called crural.</P>
<P>This Species of Rupture happens more commonly to women who have had children than to others.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES. The crural hernias differ only in bulk or &s;ize: the bigge&s;t exceed not a hen's egg, but or|dinarily they are much le&s;s.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The increa&s;e of the volume or bulk of the womb, in proportion as the woman advances in her pregnancy, is the particular cau&s;e of that &s;pecies of hernia, the guts being then obliged to bear in greater quantity on the &s;ides of the belly; and as in this ca&s;e, the mu&s;cles are &s;tretched much, and their openings, called arcades, are more patent, the guts or the caul e&s;cape more ea&s;ily at the&s;e openings, in the great &s;trainings of women with child in the act of coughing, at &s;tool, or in labour.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS. They are very &s;ubject to adhe&s;ions on account of the continual rubbings or colli&s;ions they undergo in the motion of the thigh. The bandages being ill-made, contribute thereto much: They are al&s;o &s;ubject to &s;trangulation.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The diagno&s;tic &s;igns of this &s;pecies of hernia are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the incom|pleat hernia of the groin: The &s;ituation be&s;peaks its &s;pecies, with re&s;pect to the place it occupies.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. The crural hernia is very dangerous, from the difficulty there is of reducing it into the belly; in ca&s;e of a &s;trangulation, the operation is much more dangerous. The radical cure of it is very difficult to compa&s;s; nay it is not an ea&s;y matter to keep it in with bandages; unle&s;s they are made with much care and judgment; &s;o that one may affirm in
<PB N="18" REF="29">general, that this &s;pecies of Rupture is very dange|rous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the ventral hernia.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT THE BELLY IS. THE belly con&s;i&s;ts of &s;oft parts, which are the &s;kin, the fat, and the mu&s;cles. By mu&s;cles we under&s;tand tho&s;e parts of ani|mals, which are known by the name of fle&s;h, which con&s;i&s;ts of red fibres or &s;trings, which ea&s;ily &s;eparate, when the meat or fle&s;h is boiled. The&s;e &s;trings are joined to each other by other &s;maller &s;trings of another &s;pecies, and which are &s;o fine and delicate, that the &s;ight &s;carce di&s;cerns them. It is ea&s;y to conceive that the&s;e fle&s;hy &s;trings may divide and &s;eparate from each other, by the &s;trainings we may happen to exert, and that the opening, which this divi&s;ion forms, may give pa&s;&s;age out of the belly to the guts and caul with as much ea&s;e as the natural holes, of which we have al|ready &s;poken. The&s;e &s;orts of ruptures, which may be thus formed, in all the extent of the belly, are cal|led ventral hernias.</P>
<P>DIFFERENCES. The different places of the belly, where the&s;e Ruptures happen, characterize their diffe|rence; for &s;ome of them may happen about the navel; others below; others again on the &s;ides of the belly. In fine, they may happen in all the parts of its &s;urface, and they ever are Ruptures of the belly, otherwi&s;e called ventral hernias. All of them may be produced by the gut or caul, or by both together.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="30">
<P>CAUSES. The great exten&s;ions the mu&s;cles are ex|po&s;ed to in pregnancy, and in the drop&s;y, are the proximate and mo&s;t common cau&s;es of the&s;e &s;pecies of ruptures: yet violent &s;trainings may give occa&s;ion to them.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS. Of all the &s;pecies of Ruptures there is none that fatigues and &s;pends the patients more; be|cau&s;e in the&s;e ca&s;es there is an extreme relaxation in all the parts of the belly. The continual twitchings the patients are expo&s;ed to, incapacitate them almo&s;t to walk; they are ever complaining of weakne&s;&s;es and &s;inkings, e&s;pecially after meals, which allow them no other po&s;ture but that of &s;itting or lying down. The&s;e Ruptures al&s;o are &s;ubject to &s;trangulation and adhe|&s;ions.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The ventral hernias are known by their &s;oftne&s;s, their ela&s;ticity, and the facility with which they come out of the belly, and are again re|turned, e&s;pecially at their beginning.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. The&s;e &s;pecies of hernias are incurable. They are not &s;o &s;ubject to &s;trangulation as the other Ruptures, but &s;hould it happen upon them, it is highly difficult to remedy; the&s;e &s;orts of Ruptures are then very dangerous.</P>
<P>CURE. The palliative cure is the only one that &s;uits here, &s;uch is the application of bandages; but no ban|dage, are of more difficult execution than tho&s;e for &s;uch Ruptures: And I may without pre&s;umption af|firm, that no one, be&s;ides my&s;elf, has hitherto found out the commodious, and &s;ure means of keeping in the&s;e ruptures, &s;o as to prevent their coming out in what &s;ituation or po&s;ition &s;oever the patients are put.</P>

<PB N="20" REF="31">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the means of remedying the &s;trangu|lation.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT STRAN|GULATION IS. THE &s;trangulation, as was &s;aid in chap. iv. is &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;traitning of the gut, formed by the con&s;triction of the parts thro' which it comes out of the belly, that its return is not po&s;&s;ible. In this ca&s;e we &s;ee, that it mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to all the &s;ymptoms, of which I have given a detail in the &s;ame chapter, and of what importance it is to remedy it &s;peedily.</P>
<P>THREE MEANS TO BE USED. The &s;trangulation is remedied by three means. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ituation, in which the patient &s;hould remain. The &s;econd, in the u&s;e of proper remedies. The third, in replacing the gut.</P>
<P>FIRST MEANS. In the &s;trangulation of any &s;pecies of hernia whatever, we mu&s;t procure to the parts, which are too much extended, a &s;uitable relaxation, to le&s;&s;en the &s;traitning of the gut. The patient then &s;hould be laid upon her back, the buttocks and brea&s;t be rai&s;ed by means of pillows; by this &s;ituation the exterior parts of the belly are le&s;s extended, and the ruptured guts are made to have a greater tendency to return.</P>
<P>SECOND MEANS. The patient being in this &s;ituation, the &s;uitable remedies mu&s;t be forthwith u&s;ed, and tho&s;e proper to promote the reduction of the parts. Each country, each practitioner, has his peculiar remedies; but as &s;ome of them are approved by all the people of
<PB N="21" REF="32">the profe&s;&s;ion, and every-where to be met with; 'tis on &s;uch I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t, to the end that the in&s;tructed patients may u&s;e them directly, and till they can have recour&s;e to the aid of their &s;urgeon. The colde&s;t and the harde&s;t water, as that of a pump, thrown imme|diately upon the Rupture, is the mo&s;t efficacious reme|dy, and which ought to be u&s;ed the fir&s;t, if one is &s;o happy as to apply it in the fir&s;t moments of the di&s;ea&s;e; if the patient be laid on a bed, and we apprehen&s;ive of wetting it, it will be &s;ufficient to dip rags in this water, and applying them on the affected part, &s;hift them every minute; to this water may be added half the quantity of vinegar. It is to be ob&s;erved, that this remedy, which is the mo&s;t &s;overeign of all tho&s;e we are going to pre&s;cribe, would prove highly dangerous, if not u&s;ed, at lea&s;t, at the very fir&s;t; becau&s;e after that, it di&s;po&s;es the guts to a gangrene; but being pro|perly applied, it promotes the return of the gut with as much ea&s;e as the mo&s;t dextrous hand, and the mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to this operation.</P>
<P>If the&s;e remedies have not been applied, for want of being able to &s;eize on the critical moment, the pa|tient mu&s;t be blooded directly, and that till &s;he faints away, and the &s;urgeon to improve the moment of the &s;wooning, (during which all the parts are in a &s;tate of relaxation) to procure the return of the Rupture.</P>
<P>But it may happen that this means has not &s;ucceeded, either thro' the di&s;po&s;ition of the patient, or the little experience of the &s;urgeon; in that ca&s;e we mu&s;t apply on the Rupture the remedies capable of relaxing the &s;trangling parts. Nothing is more fitted to produce this effect than the crum of bread boiled in water or milk; we may add to it oil. This poultice is wrap|ped
<PB N="22" REF="33">up in a &s;mall bag of fine cloth: But we here &s;till more u&s;efully employ warm milk put into a hog's blad|der, and applied on the ailing part, or an omelet made with oil; that of nuts is the be&s;t. The&s;e applications &s;hould be &s;hifted every three hours, and during the u&s;e of them, the patient to be let the &s;ame quantity of blood every three hours al&s;o, taking at each time 5 or 6 ounces.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we thus labour to procure the relaxation of the parts which &s;trangle the gut, we mu&s;t endeavour to void the matters which may be evacuated from the guts, by means of &s;mall gli&s;ters of river water, in which has been boiled wheat-bran, and into which is put a tea-&s;poonful of &s;ugar or common &s;alt; by thus voiding the guts, we al&s;o procure a relaxation to the ex|terior parts, by bathing and moi&s;tening them.</P>
<P>If the&s;e remedies prove ineffectual for two days, we ought not to he&s;itate a moment to procure the aid of &s;ome able &s;urgeon, who is to act in con&s;equence of the violence of the &s;ymptoms; (for then they heighten more and more) while we wait for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance we mu&s;t ap|ply a poultice made of crum of bread boiled in red wine.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es, wherein we u&s;e crum of bread, it mu&s;t be crumbled very fine and &s;mooth.</P>
<P>REGIMEN. During the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, the patients mu&s;t have no nouri&s;hment, becau&s;e they throw up all they take, and what is given them is quite lo&s;t upon them; be&s;ides, the feeding them excites the vomiting, which comes on but too often.</P>
<P>A few &s;poonfuls of broth are &s;ufficient at times, and a few &s;poonfuls of the &s;imple&s;t and lighte&s;t drink.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="34">
<P>THIRD MEANS. The replacing the parts, which is called reduction, is an operation of the hand, which con&s;i&s;ts in procuring the return, into the belly, of the gut or caul, which were come out.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to give rules on the manner of performing this operation; be&s;ides, it only concerns the people of the art to be in&s;tructed therein, and &s;o I forbear &s;peaking of it: Such as are curious of knowing the general rules, which may be given on it, may con|&s;ult Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI>'s book, Chap. XIII. Sect. II. Part 1. It is enough for the patients to know that they ought not to quit their bed, after the reduction of the parts, before they are guarded with a proper bandage, to &s;top up the hole, thro' which the guts or caul were come out, and prevent this accident from happening again. As life depends on &s;uch &s;ort of machines, and that the patients are incapable of judging of their de|fects, I am in the following chapter to give the exacte&s;t rules po&s;&s;ible to judge of their good or ill con&s;truction, and thereby enable the patients them&s;elves to determine about the advantages and di&s;advantages which may re|&s;ult from bandages or tru&s;&s;es well or ill made.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the tru&s;&s;es proper for the different &s;pecies of Ruptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT A TRUSS IS. TRUSSES are &s;olid bands made in form of a circle, applied round the body, to oppo&s;e the i&s;&s;uing forth of the Ruptures.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="35">
<P>THE MATTER OF TRUSSES. The matter of which tru&s;&s;es are made, is a compo&s;ition of iron and &s;teel forg|ed together &s;o as to acquire a &s;olid con&s;i&s;tence, ela&s;tic and incapable of warping: This la&s;t matter &s;hould only make a third, a half, or two thirds of the tru&s;s, the re&s;t to be of leather, the whole lined with cloth proper to guard again&s;t the hardne&s;s of the iron-work.</P>
<P>THE PARTS OF THE TRUSS. It is nece&s;&s;ary to know the parts of the tru&s;s before we learn to make the proper application of it, or determine its po&s;ition: Three prin|cipal parts are to be ob&s;erved in the iron-work of the tru&s;s; the plate, the circle, and the tail. The plate is the an|terior extremity, de&s;tined to fa&s;ten a cu&s;hion, which ought to &s;top up the hole of the belly; on the out&s;ide of this plate is a hook for fa&s;tening the girdle of leather: The circle is the part extending from the plate as far as to the tail; the tail is the po&s;terior extremity of the iron-work, to which is fa&s;tened the girdle of leather. The plate or the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hion is al&s;o called the point of compre&s;&s;ion; the tail, the point of &s;upport.</P>
<P>THE CONDITIONS OF THE TRUSS. The iron-work &s;hould be adju&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as to apply or fit exactly quite round the body, as otherwi&s;e it would be apt to bear fal&s;e, or warp, gall the patient, and never clo&s;e up the hole exactly, the Rupture be apt to fall out, the plate of the tru&s;s be galling, and give occa&s;ion to the adhe&s;ion, an untoward &s;ymptom, of which we have &s;poke in chap. iv.</P>
<P>TRUSS OF STEEL. The tru&s;s of &s;teel is the only one which may be applied round the body, without being &s;ubject to any variation or warping, its turn or rounding being well moulded to the &s;hape of the body for which it is made, renders it firm, invariable and
<PB N="25" REF="36">incapable of &s;hifting place, in what &s;ituation &s;oever the patients put them&s;elves.</P>
<P>SPRING-TRUSS. Some workmen have imagined they gave a great degree of perfection to the tru&s;s by adding to the cu&s;hion a &s;pring to make it bear downwards, without con&s;idering that if the compre&s;&s;ion be greater in the lower part, it is le&s;s in the upper, where the Rup|ture takes a new cour&s;e, and ever and anon comes out.</P>
<P>JOINT-TRUSSES. Others have devi&s;ed a joint-tru&s;s, the u&s;e of which is pernicious; for the tru&s;s, which &s;hould remain firm upon the body in the different motions of the patients, cannot po&s;&s;ibly do &s;o, its joints &s;uffering it to open and clo&s;e according to the motions of the patients.</P>
<P>ELASTIC TRUSSES. Many more advantages were imagined to be found in certain tru&s;&s;es, to which they have given the name of <HI>Ela&s;tic tru&s;&s;es of a new inven|tion;</HI> this ela&s;tic virtue which con&s;titutes their merit is very advantageous when this &s;ort of tru&s;s is executed by an intelligent hand, who knows how to give the degree of turn or rounding proportioned to the &s;hape of the body, on which it is to be applied, a thing extremely difficult; for otherwi&s;e it ever bears fal&s;e, galls the pa|tients, and neither re&s;trains the Rupture.</P>
<P>TRUSS WITHOUT STEEL. The tru&s;s without &s;teel has all the mo&s;t dangerous inconveniencies po&s;&s;ible; and we cannot too much caution patients again&s;t a machine, which may ea&s;ily mi&s;lead, from the notion of re&s;traint and pain at fir&s;t excited in the mind by the idea of &s;teel, which enters into the compo&s;ition of other tru&s;&s;es; but if we con&s;ider that the cu&s;hion of the tru&s;s without &s;teel has no fix'd point to render it immoveable, we &s;hall come ea&s;ily to under&s;tand that it cannot effect an exact compre&s;&s;ion on the hole of the Rupture, but
<PB N="26" REF="37">when the patient is abed, and that in that ca&s;e mo&s;t pa|tients being able to do without a tru&s;s, this &s;ort be|comes u&s;ele&s;s, and proves dagerous in all other &s;itu|ations, as it prevents not the exit of the Rupture.</P>
<P>Therefore I conclude, from what I have ju&s;t &s;aid on the &s;ubject of tru&s;&s;es, that tho&s;e agreeing the be&s;t are the &s;teel-tru&s;&s;es methodically made, that is, made ac|cording to the nature and &s;pecies of the malady, and turned or rounded to the &s;hape and &s;tructure of the bodies of the per&s;ons on which they are to be applied. But as it &s;ufficeth not that patients have tru&s;&s;es properly con&s;tructed for them, but further nece&s;&s;ary, they know how to u&s;e them to advantage, I &s;hall in the following chapter recite the inconveniencies which may happen upon the u&s;e of the&s;e machines.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the inconveniencies which may happen during the u&s;e of tru&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THREE GENERAL INCONVENIENCIES MAY make patients, but lit|tle attentive to their ail|ments, lo&s;e all the benefit they &s;hould otherwi&s;e derive from the u&s;e of tru&s;&s;es executed according to the rules of art. Some ari&s;e on the part of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf; others, of the patients; others again, of the tru&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>INCONVENIENCIES CHARGEABLE TO THE SCORE OF THE DISEASE. Ruptures of the caul are very difficult to keep in the belly, becau&s;e that part being a fatty membrane, is very &s;lippery; How little &s;o|ever
<PB N="27" REF="38">we neglect the retaining them in the belly, they are ever encrea&s;ing; patients &s;hould in that ca&s;e then &s;ubmit to wear their tru&s;&s;es night and day, and tighter than in a rupture of the gut.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Rupture is found to con&s;i&s;t of the gut and caul together, and it may happen that in this ca&s;e the gut enters into, and the caul remains out of the belly without being able to return on account of &s;ome adhe&s;ions which re&s;train it; the patients ought not there|fore to go without the tru&s;s, as it is nece&s;&s;ary to pre|vent the coming forth of the gut. Art then directs to make a tru&s;s that &s;hall clo&s;e the hole &s;o as to hinder the gut from coming out, yet not over-compre&s;s the caul, for fear of cau&s;ing &s;ome alteration therein.</P>
<P>INCONVENIENCIES TO BE LAID TO THE AC|COUNT OF THE PATIENTS. The two extremes of being too thin or too fat are inconveniencies on the part of the patients, which oppo&s;e the &s;tability of the tru&s;s, and make the u&s;e of it always difficult, unle&s;s the &s;urgeon and the patient, each on their part, give all the attention nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In an extreme leanne&s;s, the bones being bare and uncovered, but for the &s;kin, and the&s;e bones them&s;elves forming eminencies and pits, the &s;urgeon the mo&s;t ver&s;ed in making of tru&s;&s;es, mu&s;t mi&s;carry, if he em|ploy not all the attention nece&s;&s;ary to give them the &s;hape proportioned to that of the bones; but the pa|tients, on their part, ought to apply all their care to keep them in place, as we &s;hall &s;ee in chap. XIII.</P>
<P>In an extreme of corpulency, the too great quantity of fat gives the hips a difformity &s;o contrary to the natural &s;tate, that the turn of the tru&s;s &s;hould al&s;o be very different from what is a&s;&s;igned it in a moderate corpulency. And it is very difficult for the tru&s;s to be
<PB N="28" REF="39">capable of producing the effect expected from it, if the patient her&s;elf favour not the intentions, and be not careful to tighten it from time to time.</P>
<P>THE INCONVENIENCES TO BE MET WITH on the part of the patients, in Ruptures of the navel, equally ari&s;e from the difformity of the belly, which is more or le&s;s prominent, more or le&s;s thin, tight, or &s;oft, according to the greater or le&s;s degree of relaxation un|dergone by the &s;kin, the fat and the mu&s;cles in the &s;tate of pregnancy, and of con&s;equence the tru&s;&s;es for the&s;e &s;orts of Ruptures &s;hould be as differently con|&s;tructed as the &s;hapes of bellies differ; for if the belly terminate in a point towards the navel, the point of compre&s;&s;ion ea&s;ily varies; if the navel be found lower than the hips, the point of &s;upport or bearing is very difficult to find; if the belly be more rai&s;ed above the navel than below <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t, the tru&s;s tends to fall down below the Rupture: All the&s;e differences call for different de|grees of attention in the make of the tru&s;&s;es, none of which, in this ca&s;e, are capable of remaining in place, unle&s;s that &s;ort of my invention, of which I &s;hall &s;peak at the clo&s;e of this chapter.</P>
<P>The more the tru&s;s is apt to vary or &s;hift, the greater degree of con&s;tancy the patient &s;hould put on, to give it the time to fix or &s;ettle, and the &s;urgeon, on his part, endeavour to mould and fit it to the body of the patient by degrees. In per&s;ons extremely thin, we mu&s;t not at fir&s;t tighten it to the highe&s;t pitch, the u&s;e of it would then prove di&s;couraging and in&s;upportable. The parts, that &s;erve for &s;eat to it mu&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly be made accu&s;tomed to its impre&s;&s;ions. In per&s;ons extremely fat, the &s;ame precautions mu&s;t be u&s;ed, becau&s;e the fat can &s;ub&s;ide but by little and little under the tru&s;s; and &s;o it mu&s;t be tightened but in proportion as it &s;inks
<PB N="29" REF="40">in the thickne&s;s of the fat, without which it would become too wide; the&s;e degrees of attention &s;hould then be divided between the patient and the &s;urgeon, till the tru&s;s has acquired a firm and invariable &s;ituation. The patients ought not to put off their tru&s;s night and day, till they are become accu&s;tomed to it. When the Rup|tures have a great facility of coming out, as tho&s;e con|&s;i&s;ting of the caul have, every motion mu&s;t be avoided capable of determining the parts to come out, as vio|lent &s;triding, rai&s;ing the arms too high, and &s;trong &s;neezing: Finally, if the belly be bound, the patient is obliged to &s;train much at &s;tool, and then it is proper to procure an open belly by means of gly&s;ters, or mak|ing her &s;wallow half an ounce of lenitive electuary; if notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he be obliged to &s;train in the lea&s;t at &s;tool, let her re&s;t her hand on the upper part of the plate of her tru&s;s, to prevent its a&s;cending; and this &s;he is to do every time &s;he &s;neezes or coughs or blows her no&s;e; becau&s;e in the&s;e great motions the cu&s;hion of the tru&s;s is always determined or apt to a&s;cend, and then the hole it &s;hould &s;top, is found a little uncover|ed: By all this attention the parts will be gradually accu&s;tomed to remain in the belly and acquire the ha|bitude of not coming out, and the patients being abed, in that ca&s;e, they may pull off their tru&s;s at night.</P>
<P>INCONVENIENCIES ON THE PART OF THE TRUSS. We have ju&s;t &s;aid that tru&s;&s;es can only gradually mould them&s;elves to the bodies of the patients; they are therefore of them&s;elves &s;ubject to &s;ome variation, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be remedied, to procure them the utmo&s;t degree of perfection; this perfection con&s;i&s;ts, as I have already &s;aid, in the ju&s;t turn or rounding, and exactly proportioned to the parts on which the
<PB N="30" REF="41">tru&s;s is to be applied; for if it bears fal&s;e, I mean, if it bears on one part more than on another of the cir|cumference of the belly, it cannot fail to gall, and the point of compre&s;&s;ion be vicious and irregular; be&s;ide, this defect makes it &s;ubject to break in the part where is the void or hollow; this defect is not always perceivable at the very fir&s;t time it is applied on, becau&s;e the or|namenting, which is new and &s;triking conceals its hol|lows, but after being wore for &s;ome days, the orna|menting flattens; the fat, which is under the girdle, &s;ub&s;ides; the leather, which forms the re&s;t of the circle, lengthens, and the tru&s;s no longer compre&s;&s;es in any part of the circumference of the hips, unle&s;s in the part which bears fal&s;e. This inconvenience, which is con&s;iderable, is ea&s;ily amended, when we come to be well acquainted with the manner of ordering the&s;e machines: But a defect common to all the tru&s;&s;es made for the Ruptures of the groin, and tho&s;e of the bend|ings of the thighs, and for which no one before my&s;elf was ever able to find a remedy, is that they bear le&s;s on the opening, which they ought to &s;top, when one happens to &s;it very low, becau&s;e then the belly &s;inks; this defect &s;tands corrected in the tru&s;&s;es of my manner, to &s;o con&s;iderable a degree of perfection, that the pa|tients are always &s;urprized at not finding that incon|venience, after having u&s;ed the common tru&s;&s;es. And therefore it was found nece&s;&s;ary to order the patients to &s;it always high; but that is not po&s;&s;ible to be done every where, unle&s;s one was always to have her &s;eat carried about with her, a thing highly inconvenient in a thou|&s;and in&s;tances; this defect is be&s;ides to be met with on many other occa&s;ions, as in per&s;ons very thin, when abed; the cu&s;hion of the common tru&s;s never bears on the hole in fat per&s;ons, in tho&s;e of a rea&s;onable good
<PB N="31" REF="42">plight of body, in like manner as in the thin; the &s;ame thing is al&s;o to be found, when they &s;neeze, blow their no&s;e, cough, or are at &s;tool, and all the means propo&s;ed to remedy this inconvenience, are as embar|ra&s;&s;ing as u&s;ele&s;s, and in no manner come up to the &s;implicity of my tru&s;s, in which there is found none of the&s;e inconveniencies. Here is the proper, place to mention a di&s;covery, which my application to be of &s;ervice to per&s;ons of my own &s;ex, put me upon, in reflecting on the lot of many women, who&s;e delicacy of con&s;titution incapacitates them to go their full time with child.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common cau&s;e of mi&s;carriages is the &s;ame with that of Ruptures, it ari&s;es from the relaxa|tion of all the parts of the belly, both internal and ex|ternal, and takes ri&s;e in the too great quantity of &s;ero|&s;ities, which water the ligaments, which ought to keep in place each of the parts contained in the belly. Now the ligaments of the womb are &s;o often relaxed by the &s;ero&s;ities abounding in the blood, that that part remain|ing unsupported, on account of the weakne&s;s of its ligaments, it is impo&s;&s;ible the child &s;hould come to its full time, becau&s;e it determines by its weight the womb to remain in the lowe&s;t parts of the belly; and not finding there &s;ufficient room to grow, dies thro' the con&s;traint it undergoes.</P>
<P>The means I have found to remedy the&s;e trouble&s;ome di&s;orders are as &s;imple as the following rea&s;oning, which I u&s;e to prove its efficacy. The ligaments of the womb, and the mu&s;cles of the lower belly being too much relaxed, the growth of the child is prevented, becau&s;e the womb tends too much towards the lowe&s;t part of the belly, where it is &s;traitened for room, the mu&s;cles of the belly not being &s;trong enough to &s;upport
<PB N="32" REF="43">it forwards: If by the means of a tru&s;s sufficient to ba|lance the relaxation of the&s;e parts, that defect may be &s;upplied, it is not to be doubted but that women &s;ub|ject to mi&s;carriages will happily go their full time: The experience of upwards a hundred women, to whom I have given this relief, proves it; having often mi&s;carried, before the u&s;e of my tru&s;s.</P>
<P>It is made of a flexible matter without any iron|work at all, but &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t the weight of the belly. It &s;tretches in proportion to the growth of the child; nothing is more ea&s;y to apply and to wear; it puts pregnant women, the mo&s;t &s;ubject to mi&s;car|riages, in a condition to walk and go by any carriages; and it becomes &s;o commodious to them, by giving a degree of firmne&s;s to the whole body, that many wo|men u&s;e it out of the time of their pregnancy. But it proves, be&s;ides, highly u&s;eful to women, who&s;e belly, being very heavy and pendulous, hinders them to walk, and to per&s;ons to whom it is not po&s;&s;ible to apply the common tru&s;&s;es of the navel.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> A method for taking the mea&s;ures of the tru&s;&s;es, nece&s;&s;ary for per&s;ons afflicted with ruptures.</HEAD>
<P>PERSONS, who would incline to procure tru&s;&s;es for them&s;elves, not always living near great towns, where they are commonly made, have need of in|&s;truction to enable them to &s;end their exact mea&s;ure; I imagine it to be u&s;eful for &s;uch, to put them on the
<PB N="33" REF="44">ea&s;y method of taking exactly the dimen&s;ions of their own bodies, and to in&s;i&s;t more particularly on &s;ome circum&s;tances they ought to ob&s;erve in relation to the different &s;pecies of Ruptures.</P>
<P>FIRST, The patient &s;hould give a particular detail, in an in&s;tructive memorial, of her con&s;titution and age; whether &s;he be maid or married woman; the date of her Rupture; and whether the place &s;he lives in be moi&s;t and mar&s;hy, or dry.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, She &s;hould, as much as may be, re|collect the cau&s;e, which has determined or occa&s;ioned her Rupture, whether a blow, a fall, a fit of coughing, a &s;udden effort or &s;training, or child-bearing.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, She mu&s;t determine nearly the &s;ize of the Rupture, and on what &s;ide it lies.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, She mu&s;t &s;et down preci&s;ely its place, if in the groin or bending of the thigh.</P>
<P>FIFTHLY, Whether or no it re-enters, and whether, in re-entring, it returns more difficultly in a &s;tanding than lying po&s;ture.</P>
<P>SIXTHLY, When the Rupture is in the bending of the groin, it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h whether it de|&s;cends as low as the &s;ide of the natural parts.</P>
<P>SEVENTHLY, If it is in the bending of the thigh, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify, whether it be round or long.</P>
<P>EIGHTHLY, If there are two Ruptures, it is nece&s;|&s;ary to hint which is the bigge&s;t.</P>
<P>NINTHLY, It mu&s;t be remarked, whether the per&s;on be fat or thin, or only in a tolerable good plight, of body.</P>
<P>TENTHLY, It mu&s;t be hinted, whether the patient has one hip bigger than the other, which is a very com|mon ca&s;e; or if there be any other deformity, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="34" REF="45">not to fail de&s;cribing it, and &s;etting down its place with ink upon the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To this memorial the patient may add the mea&s;ure of her body, taken with a &s;lip of paper of a proper length. Whether the Rupture be &s;ingle or double, in the groin, or bending of the thigh, it is &s;ufficient to lay the middle of the &s;lip of paper immediately over the part where the clift of the breech ends, and to join the two ends of the paper above the place where the top of the natural parts re-unite.</P>
<P>If the rupture be in the navel, in the &s;ame manner will be taken the &s;ize of the belly, by laying the middle of the &s;lip of paper on the part of the back which an|&s;wers to tho&s;e of the &s;ides, which are between the ribs and the bones of the hips, and by joining the two ends of the paper over-again&s;t the part where the middle of the paper has been laid behind the back; if the Rup|ture be preci&s;ely at the meeting of the two ends of the &s;lip of paper, that mu&s;t needs be &s;pecified in the me|morial; if not, it is nece&s;&s;ary to mark exactly at what di&s;tance from this meeting of the two ends of the &s;lip the Rapture lies, whether a quarter of an inch, half an inch, or one or two inches above or below.</P>
<P>Care al&s;o may be taken to &s;pecify in the memorial, <HI>1mo.</HI> The part of the navel the Rupture occupies, either the middle or its circumference, either lies above or below it, or to one &s;ide. <HI>2do,</HI> If it is of an old or recent &s;tanding. <HI>3tio,</HI> Its &s;ize. <HI>4to,</HI> Its &s;hape. <HI>5to,</HI> If it re-enters or not. <HI>6to,</HI> If the navel be higher or lower than the bone of the hips. <HI>7mo,</HI> If the belly be hard or very &s;oft; 'tis moreover nece&s;&s;ary to know, whether the patient has had children, and how many.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="46">
<P>All tho&s;e particulars are very nece&s;&s;ary to be men|tioned, in order to execute with care the tru&s;&s;es proper in each of the&s;e circum&s;tances, and render them as com|modious as u&s;eful, when the patients oh their part &s;hall u&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary care in their ju&s;t application: On this head I am to pre&s;cribe &s;ome rules in the following chap|ter.</P>

<P>THE tru&s;s would become ab&s;olutely un&s;erviceable, if improperly adju&s;ted. It is, therefore, of im|portance to the patients, to have rules to follow for their ju&s;t application. The&s;e rules are the &s;ame for per&s;ons of what age &s;oever, even for children at the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the tru&s;s is to &s;top the hole, at which the rupture comes out, in order to prevent its coming out; we mu&s;t for that purpo&s;e begin with reducing it back into the belly.</P>
<P>The Ruptures, unaccompanied with &s;ymptoms, re|enter with facility enough of them&s;elves, when the patients are abed; of con&s;equence, the morning, at the hour of waking, is the time to apply the tru&s;s. To do it with ea&s;e, of what nature &s;oever, or in what part &s;oever the Rupture be, we pa&s;s the girdle below the
<PB N="36" REF="47">back, and approach with one hand the cu&s;hion of the tru&s;s over-again&s;t the part of the Rupture; with the other we examine whether any thing remains out of the belly; afterwards, laying hold with this la&s;t hand on the girdle of the tru&s;s, we pull it to our&s;elves to|wards the cu&s;hion, whil&s;t with the other we fix the cu&s;hion directly upon the part where the Rupture ap|peared before reduction: We at the &s;ame time fa&s;ten the girdle to the hook, which is on the out&s;ide of the cu&s;hion.</P>
<P>To procure the proper po&s;ition to the tru&s;s, the lower border of the girdle &s;hould be behind the back, immediately above the clift of the breech. When we are &s;ure it has gained its due po&s;ition, we mu&s;t then tighten it &s;ufficiently: For this purpo&s;e we lay hold on the girdle with one hand, at the part where it joins to the iron-work of the tru&s;s, and we pull it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by &s;lipping the hand as far as to its extremity; while with the other hand we hold the cu&s;hion &s;teady on the part where it &s;hould be placed; if it were not &s;up|ported, it would &s;hift to one &s;ide of the thigh, and no longer be found on the hole of the Rupture. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that the tru&s;s be too &s;lack, and neither mu&s;t it be too right. You will ob&s;erve to tighten it from time to time; fat people &s;hould particularly mind this, becau&s;e the longer they u&s;e the tru&s;s, the fat &s;inks un|der the girdle, which of con&s;equence becomes too &s;lack; which is the rea&s;on that the over-&s;lackening of the girdle is charged on its lengthening: And it al&s;o happens that the girdle of the tru&s;s is found hid by the pads which the fat forms both above and below, when the fat has been entirely flattened under the girdle by its reiterated compre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="48">
<P>Almo&s;t all the patients have the cu&s;tom of placing the cu&s;hion of their tru&s;s too low, e&s;pecially &s;uch who&s;e Ruptures fall down pretty low, without con&s;idering, that the bu&s;ine&s;s is only to &s;top the hole, to prevent the parts from coming out; for when the cu&s;hion is placed &s;o low, the hole remaining un&s;topped, the Rup|ture comes out above the cu&s;hion of the tru&s;s.</P>
<P>When the patients are thin, the tru&s;s fails not to a&s;|cend, e&s;pecially when they are abed: In this ca&s;e we mu&s;t u&s;e a &s;mall &s;trap, which is fixed to the tru&s;s; we pa&s;s it under the thigh, and fa&s;ten it to the iron-hook, which &s;erves to fix the girdle; but we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it ought to be put under the leather of the girdle, as otherwi&s;e it would be always apt to loo&s;en.</P>
<P>When there is a nece&s;&s;ity of wearing the tru&s;s of nights, we mu&s;t take care to adju&s;t or put it in order before we get out of bed of a morning, and as the mo|tions we give our&s;elves lower or rai&s;e it behind, we mu&s;t not fail replacing it in its due po&s;ition, as other|wi&s;e the cu&s;hion would not bear exactly upon the hole.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to children who are not cleanly, we mu&s;t be careful of &s;hifting their tru&s;&s;es every day, to prevent the ordure from heating or fretting them.</P>
<P>In plump fat children, the girdle &s;hould behind be a good finger's breadth above the clift of the breech; in the thin, it &s;hould immediately touch the clift, or even be a little lower.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t be ever cautious in &s;hifting their tru&s;s, that the Rupture does not fall out again; for this pur|po&s;e, we mu&s;t have ready at hand that which is to replace the other, and lay the finger on the hole, till the &s;econd tru&s;s is adju&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the radical cure of Ruptures.</HEAD>
<P>BY radical cure we mean &s;uch as removes a di&s;ea&s;e to its very root. The radical cure of Ruptures is, therefore, that, by means of which we may cure the&s;e di&s;orders, without apprehen&s;ion of any return. Is this po&s;&s;ible? 'Tis what may be ea&s;ily proved.</P>
<P>But as I &s;hould be obliged to tran&s;cribe word for word what Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI> has at large to &s;o good purpo&s;e writ on this &s;ubject, &s;uch as would &s;atisfy them&s;elves of this truth may con&s;ult the book of that author, chap. xiv. &s;ect. ii. part i.</P>
<P>All I can &s;ay to prevail on the patients not to &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to be di&s;couraged, as commonly tho&s;e are, who are afflicted with the&s;e di&s;orders, is, that there are none for which there is a greater variety of reme|dies known. The only que&s;tion is to know how to ap|propriate them to the con&s;titutions of the patients, their age, their &s;ex, the climates they inhabit, and to know how to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;pecies of Ruptures which are curable from tho&s;e which are incurable. 'Tis with the&s;e infirmities as with all the others; &s;uch a one can|not be cured by a remedy, which ten or a &s;core others have found the good effects of, becau&s;e the circum&s;tances differ. This is the rea&s;on, why the remedies of the good women do &s;ometimes much good, and very often a great deal of harm.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of the Ruptures of the womb, otherwi&s;e called the inver&s;ion of the womb, re|laxation of the womb, falling of the womb; the relaxation and inver&s;ion of the vagina.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT THE WOMB IS. THE womb is the principal or|gan of generation, it is &s;ituated between the bladder and &s;treight gut. The womb is of the &s;hape of a pocket-fla&s;k; it is divided into two parts; the one called the neck, the other the body of the womb: Its neck is terminated by an opening, cal|ed the orifice; it an&s;wers to the bottom of the vagina; its body is the large&s;t part; it is &s;eated in the lower bel|ly beyond the vagina, &s;o that we can only reach to the neck of the womb, when we introduce the finger into the part.</P>
<P>The womb is hollow within, and kept in its place by four ligaments; two called the broad, and two the round.</P>
<P>'Tis the&s;e ligaments we are principally to regard, in order to form a ju&s;t idea of the Ruptures of the womb: The&s;e ligaments are capable of an extraordinary degree of exten&s;ion; otherwi&s;e the womb could not place it&s;elf in the belly, by &s;tretching in the time of preg|nancy; but would continue in its natural place, and be there &s;traitned and confined.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="51">
<P>The broad ligaments cover all the exterior bottom of the womb. They are there firmly attached; they ri&s;e on each &s;ide, and &s;tretch, by enlarging, to proceed to fa&s;ten on the parts which cover the hip bones inter|nally: 'Tis a &s;ort of very &s;trong membrane.</P>
<P>The round ligaments are &s;o called from their round figure like a cord; they are as big as the quill of a raven; of a nature re&s;embling that of the broad ligaments; for they are properly only a divi&s;ion of them; they come out of the belly at the holes which are in the groin, by which the Ruptures of the groin happen; they proceed to fa&s;ten them&s;elves to the bone of the thigh. The womb is kept in place by the&s;e four ligaments.</P>
<P>The vagina is a canal, con&s;i&s;ting of a very thick membrane, capable of dilating and contracting; this canal &s;erves for an emunctory or drain to the flowings from the womb.</P>
<P>INVERSION OF THE WOMB. The womb being the principal organ of generation, it &s;ometimes happens, that in child bearing the in&s;ide of this comes out at its opening or orifice, in the manner as turning a pur&s;e in|&s;ide out; this di&s;order has, be&s;ides, other cau&s;es; but the&s;e very rare. The being over-fat is one in particular. This di&s;temper is &s;o di&s;tinctly handled in Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI>'s book, chap xxiv. &s;ect. ii. p. 1. that I thither refer &s;uch as would be further informed about it: I could only copy this author, and that would be to di&s;gu&s;t him.</P>
<P>RELAXATION OF THE WOMB. Tho' the term re|laxation of the womb be improper, I &s;hall however make u&s;e of it, becau&s;e all authors do &s;o: For it is not the womb that relaxes; 'tis its ligaments, which
<PB N="41" REF="52">lengthening, &s;uffer the womb to quit its natural place, and thus to fall down more or le&s;s into the vagina.</P>
<P>When the ligaments are only relaxed to a certain pitch, this is what is properly called the relaxation of the womb, becau&s;e it is come down lower than the place it naturally occupies, but comes not out of the vagina.</P>
<P>FALLING OP THE WOMB. When the womb comes out at the vagina, then that &s;pecies of Rupture is called the falling of the womb: This di&s;order may be more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, according as it comes out more or le&s;s; there are &s;ome, in whom, for want of mind|ing it, it hangs down as low as the middle of the thighs, and then it grows in bigne&s;s to a pitch as &s;ometimes to become as big as the head of a child.</P>
<P>RELAXATION OF THE VAGINA. The vagina re|laxes too, and that either in part or in whole; if in part only, the di&s;order is called, the relaxation of the vagina; if in whole, the inver&s;ion of the vagina; then it forms an eminence, which comes out of the natural parts.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The general and particular cau&s;es of the&s;e di&s;orders are the &s;ame with tho&s;e contributing to form the other Ruptures; of con&s;equence young women are &s;ubject to them. 'Tis true they are not &s;o much ex|po&s;ed to them, as the married; but there are &s;ome in whom the womb falls, and the vagina relaxes to the highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>Married women are more &s;ubject to them, becau&s;e in pregnancy the ligaments of the womb are extremely lengthened, by the weight of the child it contains: Al|&s;o tho&s;e who are not tender enough of them&s;elves, after delivery, by keeping at re&s;t and not &s;tirring, are more &s;ubject to the&s;e infirmities than others.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="53">
<P>SYMPTOMS. The &s;ymptoms of the&s;e di&s;orders differ according to the ca&s;e. When there is only a re|laxation of die womb, the patients feel &s;ome pain to|wards the loins, and at the top of the thighs. They walk with le&s;s facility, and are never better than when &s;itting, or abed.</P>
<P>When the womb comes out a little at the vagina, be&s;ides what I have ju&s;t &s;aid, the patient has a de&s;ire to make water often, or a difficulty in making it.</P>
<P>When the womb is in whole come out, it is expo&s;ed to the rubbing of the thighs, and to receive the impre&s;|&s;ions of the urine, which runs upon it in making wa|ter, which cau&s;es it to &s;mart, occa&s;ions painful excori|ations, and con&s;iderable ulcers.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms are followed by tho&s;e which attack the womb it&s;elf; it is inflated and hardened, and then it is very difficult to effect its return.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms which accompany the relaxation of the vagina and its inver&s;ion, are not &s;o con&s;iderable, un|le&s;s when it carries along with it the womb; for then the patients feel the &s;ame pains in the loins and thighs as in the falling of the womb. But, in the &s;imple re|laxation of the vagina, there is no pain.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The&s;e di&s;orders are known by the &s;ymptoms I have ju&s;t mentioned, excepting the &s;imple relaxation of the vagina, which can only be known by a &s;ort of &s;welling or inflation, felt at its en|trance.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. In the&s;e four di&s;orders, the relaxation and inver&s;ion of the vagina are the mo&s;t difficult to cure, tho' without any danger to life; the relaxation, or falling of the womb, ju&s;t beginning,
<PB N="43" REF="54">is ea&s;ily enough cured, when the di&s;temper is not of an old &s;tanding: It even happens &s;ometimes, that after a new pregnancy, if the patient be tender of her&s;elf in her lying-in, and keep her bed clo&s;e, &s;he is cured with|our the aid of any remedies.</P>
<P>But the grand &s;ymptoms to which the womb is &s;ub|ject, when it comes out entirely, are &s;ufficient to mani|fe&s;t the danger, and the difficulty there is to cure the patients.</P>
<P>CURE. The relaxations and failing of the womb, the relaxations and inver&s;ions of the vagina, are &s;u&s;cep|tible, as the other &s;pecies of Ruptures, of a twofold cure, the radical and the palliative.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not engage in the detail of the fir&s;t, that would carry me too far, and I could hot abridge it, without omitting things too nece&s;&s;ary; it may be &s;een in chap. xxv and xxvi. &s;ect. ii. P. I. of Mr. <HI>Ar|naud's</HI> work.</P>
<P>The palliative cure, which is the mo&s;t u&s;ed, con|&s;i&s;ts in keeping in place the relaxed or di&s;placed parts by the means of pe&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Pe&s;&s;aries are in&s;truments which &s;erve to keep the womb and the vagina in place, and to hinder their de|parting too much from their natural &s;tate. The com|mon u&s;e of the&s;e machines, which are made in different forms and &s;hapes, according to the notions of him who applies them, or the nature of the malady, has inconve|niencies &s;o con&s;iderable, that the advantage derived from them is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf; be&s;ides, that we are obliged to introduce them into the part with violence, and keep them there without &s;carce ever removing them; the&s;e pe&s;&s;aries are always made either of matters &s;ubject to corruption, as cork and wood; or incorruptible, as
<PB N="44" REF="55">gold of ivory, which hurt the womb or the vagina; this cau&s;es a flow of matter extremely fetid, with which the patients them&s;elves are always offended, and often tho&s;e who approach them.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons have put Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI> on contriving a &s;ort of pe&s;&s;aries, with all the advantages we can de&s;ire, and without any of the inconveniencies of the others. It is the only pe&s;&s;ary I would advi&s;e patients to u&s;e, and who&s;e de&s;cription is very clearly given in that author's book chap. xxvii. &s;ect. ii. P. I.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Of the relaxation of the fundament.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT THE FUN|DAMENT IS. THE fundament is the ex|tremity of the guts, which terminate in a round opening, with a power to open and clo&s;e. Its u&s;e is to allow the di&s;charge of the excrements and wind out of the belly.</P>
<P>The extremity of the gut, which ends at the funda|ment, is &s;ometimes relaxed; and comes out by turning it&s;elf, ju&s;t like the finger of a glove, when we pull the glove by turning it.</P>
<P>This malady happens very commonly to children; women are al&s;o &s;ubject to it &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>CAUSES. The cau&s;e of this relaxation con&s;i&s;ts for the mo&s;t part in the too great quantity of &s;ero&s;ities, which water this part; the pal&s;y of the mu&s;cles of the funda|ment contributes &s;ometimes too.</P>
<P>But &s;trainings determine this di&s;temper; as crying in children, con&s;tipation in per&s;ons in years, and the effort exerted in child-bearing.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="56">
<P>SYMPTOMS. It is rare that this, malady is accom|panied with untoward &s;ymptoms; being &s;o incommodi|ous, people never put off the looking out for the proper aid. But were the procuring the return of the gut neglected, an inflammation would be formed in it, and a gangrene might &s;eize upon it, which would expo&s;e the patients to a very great ri&s;k.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. This di&s;temper is known by the eminence or lengthening formed by the gut of the fundament.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. According to what we have ju&s;t &s;een of the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;temper, it is ea&s;y to judge, that it is dangerous, when neglected.</P>
<P>CURE. We remedy this di&s;temper by procuring the return of the gut, and retaining it, when returned; or by employing the remedies proper to fortify and &s;trengthen it. All the&s;e means are recited in chap. xxviii. of Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI>'s book.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of fal&s;e hernia's.</HEAD>
<P>IT now remains to &s;peak of fal&s;e hernia's. The&s;e di&s;tempers are &s;o rare in the &s;ex, that I might well pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence; yet as I have &s;een &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, and that they were taken for Ruptures; I think it not from the purpo&s;e to give a general notion of them.</P>
<P>WHAT A FALSE HERNIA IS. We under&s;tand by fal&s;e hernias, tumours that happen in the parts where the true Ruptures are formed; they are called fal&s;e, be|cau&s;e they impo&s;e upon us, by giving room to think them true Ruptures, unle&s;s we carefully con&s;ider them.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="57">
<P>DIFFERENCES. There are two &s;pecies of them; &s;ome con&s;i&s;t of water; the&s;e are called hydroceles; others, of fle&s;h, or thick, hard, and vi&s;cid humours; the&s;e are called extraneous bodies.</P>
<P>The hydroceles &s;ometimes &s;hew them&s;elves in the bendings of the thighs, in the groin, and in the lips of the natural parts; there may be formed of them two in the navel.</P>
<P>The extraneous bodies are formed at the entrance of the vagina, and in its cavity; &s;ometimes al&s;o they are attached to the neck of the womb.</P>
<P>DIAGNOSTIC SIGNS. The fal&s;e hernias are known by the impo&s;&s;ibility there is of procuring their return; to the difference of true Ruptures, which return ea&s;ily to the belly, or at lea&s;t have returned before they have got adhe&s;ions, or are become of enormous bulk; but hydroceles, how &s;mall and recent &s;oever they be, ne|ver return.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame as to extraneous bodies, the&s;e return not; but they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from hydroceles, as they are quite apart and &s;eparate from the parts to which they are attached; hydroceles, on the contrary, unite with the parts where they grow.</P>
<P>PROGNOSTIC SIGNS. We may &s;ay, that the&s;e, di|&s;tempers are attended with no unea&s;ine&s;s; they are rather incommodious than dangerous.</P>
<P>CURE. Hydroceles are cured by tapping, or di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing them by re&s;olvents; they are, be&s;ides, cured by compre&s;&s;ions, by the means of &s;ome proper bandages or tru&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As to extraneous bodies, the&s;e are de&s;troyed by liga|ture or inci&s;ion.</P>
