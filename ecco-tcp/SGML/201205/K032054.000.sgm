<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH publi&s;hers of receipts have been always very numerous, yet it has &s;o happened, that the lea&s;t able have hitherto undertaken this ta&s;k, as the mo&s;t ea&s;y and likely to an&s;wer any merce|nary views; which &s;eems to have been the rea&s;on, that more able per&s;ons have neglected it as an under part of their profe&s;&s;ion. Ne|verthele&s;s, I have per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that I &s;hould perform a work, neither entirely void, of u&s;e, nor foreign to the duties of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion, if I made the public partakers of the principal helps again&s;t mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, which I had either learned by long experience, or &s;elected from the writings of the mo&s;t emi|nent phy&s;icians. As the&s;e receipts are pub|li&s;hed chiefly for the u&s;e of per&s;ons re&s;iding in the country, who&s;e convenience or abilities, will not allow of the attendance of a phy&s;ician or apothecary, I have &s;tudied plainne&s;s in my &s;tile, and in my directions, with regard to the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es, that I might render this treati&s;e as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this work has met with, as is &s;ufficiently &s;hewn by the remarkable quick &s;ale of the fir&s;t large impre&s;&s;ion, has induced the editor (to &s;upport the credit of what is really bene|ficial to the public, and add weight to the receipts) to publi&s;h the authorities from whence tho&s;e receipts were taken; and to make it &s;till more u&s;eful, has added the &s;igns of di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;ome plain and conci&s;e direc|tions for bleeding: he begs leave to remark, that although Dr. Theobald has given no more than one receipt for the cure of &s;everal di&s;orders, yet he has been careful to &s;elect &s;uch, <HI>only,</HI> as upon a long experience were found to be the be&s;t; and that although re|ceipts are given for di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;eldom cured, (as the apoplexy, con&s;umption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) yet if it is in the power of medicine to remove any of the&s;e complaints, there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to imagine, that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect a cure.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS concerning BLEEDING.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Bleeding has been directed in many di&s;orders in the cour&s;e of this work; yet as the improper u&s;e of it is attended frequently with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences, it has been judged nece&s;&s;ary to bring into one point of view all tho&s;e ca&s;es in which bleeding may be admini&s;t|ered with advantage, as well as tho&s;e in which it is highly prejudical. In all inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, it &s;hould by no means be omitted, as in the Pleu|ri&s;y, and Peripneumony, during the fir&s;t days; but &s;o &s;oon as the &s;ymptoms of &s;uppuration ap|pear expectorating medicines are the mo&s;t proper means from which to expect relief, and the u&s;e of the lancet mu&s;t be totally forbid. In the Apo|plexy, Epilep&s;y, Bloody-flux and Inflammation of the bowels, bleeding mu&s;t be repeated accord|ing to the exigence of the &s;ymptoms: it is al&s;o u&s;eful, &s;ometimes to promote &s;uppuration in large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, where nature is too much oppre&s;t by the violence of the inflammation. In Inflamma|tions of the Eyes, Bladder, or Womb, I&s;chiatic pains, Rheumati&s;ms, Coughs, Head-achs, Quin|&s;eys, A&s;thmas, Hemorrhages, and Nephritic complaints, Bleeding is of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice: but in every di&s;order proceeding from a relaxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els, and impoveri&s;hed &s;tate of the Blood, attended with a cachectic habit of body, &s;uch as Drop&s;ies, Jaundice, Gout, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bleeding mu&s;t be ab&s;tained from with the utmo&s;t caution, as it will, in&s;tead of relieving, greatly aggravate tho&s;e di&s;tempers.</P>
