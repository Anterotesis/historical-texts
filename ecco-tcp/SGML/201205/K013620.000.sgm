<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Health is the noble&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of this life, the method of pro|curing it &s;hould be our principal en|quiry. While po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, we &s;eldom pay a proper attention to its importance; when lo&s;t, we become &s;en&s;ible of its value, but are frequently carele&s;s con|cerning its recovery. The rea&s;ons are plain; while we have it we trifle with it till it flies us; when fled, we trifle with our misfortune, becau&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e the recovery to be either impo&s;&s;ible or im|probable.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
<P>For the benefit of mankind, we here furni&s;h the public with &s;ome of the be&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t methods of recovering and &s;ecuring health, and of pre&s;erving life, which comprehend the greate&s;t di&s;co|veries in the Medical Art. The&s;e will equally &s;uit all ranks of people; the <HI>Poor,</HI> becau&s;e the Remedies may be <HI>cheaply</HI> obtained; and the <HI>Rich,</HI> becau&s;e they may be <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> put in practice.

<HEAD>SCURVY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scurvy being the principal di&s;ea&s;e inci|dent to the inhabitants of Great Britain, and the &s;ource from whence many of their other di&s;orders flow, we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to commence this &s;alutary Work, with an account of the nature of, and the remedies again&s;t, this fatal foe to ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONS.</P>

<HEAD>SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms or &s;igns of this dangerous di&s;ea&s;e are a frequent lazine&s;s and lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, pains in various parts of the body, &s;ometimes livid &s;pots, often a &s;allow complexion, a continual itching of the blood, difficulty of breathing, &s;welling of the legs, bleeding
<PB N="6" REF="6">at the no&s;e, and &s;pongy gums, &s;ubject to pains and bleedings. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that as con&s;ti|tutions differ, the &s;igns or &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e vary; and people, according to their years, &s;ituations in life, and manner of living, are attacked by this di&s;ea&s;e, under &s;everal appearances; but &s;ome of the above &s;ymptoms always attend it according to the con&s;titution of tho&s;e afflicted; for who&s;e benefit we &s;hall point out the mo&s;t approved and certain me|thods of cure hitherto di&s;covered.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>A Milk diet, with weak whey, greens of all kinds, fre&s;h vegetables, fruits, acids, &s;curvy-gra&s;s ale, fre&s;h beer and cyder, tar water taken twice a day, with camphire, one &s;cruple, aethiops mineral, half an ounce, powder of gum-guaiacum, two drachms, ho|ney, one ounce, mix and make an electuary, and take the bigne&s;s of a nutmeg every night going to re&s;t. The patient may likewi&s;e drink the decoction of the woods. Drinking &s;ea-water will be found extremely beneficial, as will bathing in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>But for the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t efficacious remedy for this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, we may thank Capt. Cook, who in his late voyage round the world, by the command of his pre&s;ent MAJESTY in the &s;hip <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> pre|&s;erved him&s;elf and all his men from the Scurvy, by the u&s;e of a very &s;imple medicine; though he pa&s;&s;ed through the temperature, the frigid and the torrid zones, was ab&s;ent from England three years and eigh|teen days, and went through &s;uch a variety of cli|mates, as were &s;ufficient to make the &s;evere&s;t attacks on the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titution. But as his methods of proceeding will appear with mo&s;t propriety in his own words, we &s;hall pre&s;ent our readers with his Letter to Sir <HI>John Pringle,</HI> Bart, Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> which letter is dated <HI>March</HI> 5, 1776;
<PB N="7" REF="7">and for which Captain Cook received a Premium Medal.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"AS many gentlemen have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize at the uncommon good &s;tate of health which the crew of the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> under my command, ex|perienced during her late voyage; I take the liberty to communicate to you the methods that were taken to obtain that end. Much was owing to the ex|traordinary attention given by the Admiralty, in cau&s;ing &s;uch articles to be put on board, as either by experience or conjecture were judged to tend mo&s;t to pre&s;erve the health of &s;eamen. I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s upon your time in mentioning all tho&s;e articles, but confine my&s;elf to &s;uch as were found the mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>"We had on board a large quantity of malt, of which was made &s;weet-wort, and given (not only to tho&s;e men who had manife&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;curvy, but to &s;uch al&s;o as were, from circum&s;tances, judged to be mo&s;t liable to that di&s;order) from one to two or three pints in the day to each man, or in &s;uch proportion as the &s;urgeon thought nece&s;&s;ary; which &s;ometimes amounted to three quarts in the twenty-four hours. This is without doubt one of the be&s;t anti&s;corbutic &s;ea-medicines yet found out; and if given in time will, with proper attention to other things, I am per&s;uaded, prevent the &s;curvy from making any great progre&s;s for a con&s;iderable time: but I am not altogether of opinion, that it will cure it in an advanced &s;tate at &s;ea.</P>
<P>"Sour-krout, of which we had al&s;o a large pro|vi&s;ion, is not only a whole&s;ome vegetable food, but, in my judgment, highly anti&s;corbutic, and &s;poils not by keeping. A pound of it was &s;erved to each
<PB N="8" REF="8">man, when at &s;ea, twice a week, or oftener when it was thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>"Portable &s;oup, or broth, was another e&s;&s;ential article, of which we had likewi&s;e a liberal &s;upply. An ounce of this to each man, or &s;uch other pro|portion as was thought nece&s;&s;ary, was boiled with their peas three days in the week; and when we were in places where fre&s;h vegetables could be pro|cured, it was boiled, with them and with wheat or oatmeal, every morning for breakfa&s;t, and al&s;o with dried peas and fre&s;h vegetables for dinner. It enabled us to make &s;everal nouri&s;hing and whole|&s;ome me&s;&s;es, and was the means of making the peo|ple eat a greater quantity of greens than they would have done otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>"Further, we were provided with rob of lemons and oranges; which the &s;urgeon found u&s;eful in &s;e|veral ca&s;es.</P>
<P>"Among&s;t other articles of victualling, we were furni&s;hed with &s;ugar in the room of oil, and with wheat in&s;tead of much oatmeal, and were certainly gainers by the exchange. Sugar, I imagine, is a very good anti&s;corbutic; whereas oil, &s;uch at lea&s;t as is u&s;ually given to the navy, I apprehend has the contrary effect. But the introduction of the mo&s;t &s;alutary articles, either as provi&s;ion or medicines will generally prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, unle&s;s &s;upported by certain rules of living.</P>
<P>"On this principle, many years experience, to|gether with &s;ome hints I had from Sir Hugh Palli&s;er, the Captains Campbell, Wallis, and other intelligent officers, enabled me to lay down a plan whereby all was to be conducted. The crew were at three watches, except upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions. By this means they were not &s;o much expo&s;ed to the weather as if they had been at watch and watch; and they had generally dry cloaths to &s;hift them&s;elves when
<PB N="9" REF="9">they happened to get wet. Care was al&s;o taken to expo&s;e them as little as po&s;&s;ible. Proper methods were employed to keep their per&s;ons, hammocks, bedding, cloaths, &amp;c. con&s;tantly clean and dry. Equal pains were taken to keep the &s;hip clean and dry between decks. Once or twice a week &s;he was aired with fires; and when this could not be done, &s;he was &s;moaked with gunpowder moi&s;tened with vinegar or water. I had al&s;o frequently a fire made in an iron pot at the bottom of the well, which greatly purified the air in the lower parts of the &s;hip. To this and cleanline&s;s, as well in the &s;hip as among&s;t the people, too great attention cannot be paid; the lea&s;t neglect occa&s;ions a putrid offen&s;ive &s;mell below, which nothing but fires will remove; and if the&s;e be not u&s;ed in time, tho&s;e &s;mells will be attended with bad con&s;equences. Proper care was taken of the &s;hip's coppers, &s;o that they were kept con&s;tantly clean. The fat, which boiled out of the &s;alt beef and pork, I never &s;uffered to be given to the people, as is cu&s;tomary; being of opinion that it promotes the &s;curvy. I never failed to take in water wherever it was to be procured, even when we did not &s;eem to want it; becau&s;e I look upon fre&s;h water from the &s;hore to be much more whole&s;ome than that which has been kept for &s;ome time on board. Of this e&s;&s;en|tial article we were never at an allowance, but had always abundance for every nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e. I am convinced that with plenty of fre&s;h water, and a clo&s;e attention to cleanline&s;s, a &s;hip's company will &s;eldom be much afflicted with the &s;curvy, though they &s;hould not be provided with any of the anti&s;corbutics before-mentioned. We came to few places where either the art of man or nature did not afford &s;ome &s;ort of refre&s;hment or other, either of the animal or vege|table kind. It was my fir&s;t care to procure what could be met with of either, by every means in my
<PB N="10" REF="10">power, and to oblige our people to make u&s;e thereof, both by my example and authority; but the benefits ari&s;ing from &s;uch refre&s;hments &s;oon became &s;o obvious, that I had little occa&s;ion to employ either the one or the other.</P>
<Q><P>"The&s;e, Sir, were the methods, under the care of Providence, by which the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> performed a voy|age of three years and eighteen days, through all the climates from 52 degrees north to 71 degrees &s;outh, with the lo&s;s of one man only by di&s;ea&s;e, and who died of a complicated and lingering illne&s;s, without any mixture of &s;curvy. Two others were unfortu|nately drowned, and one killed by a fall; &s;o that of the whole number with which I &s;et out from England, I lo&s;t only four.</P>
<P>"I have the honour to be, Sir, &amp;c."</P></Q>
</LETTER>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Captain <HI>Cook</HI> to Sir <HI>John Pringle,</HI> Bart. dated <HI>Plymouth Sound, July 7, 1776.</HI></HEAD>
<Q>"I entirely agree with you, that the dearne&s;s of the rob of lemons and oranges will hinder them from being furni&s;hed in large quantities, but I do not think this &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; for though they may a&s;&s;i&s;t other things, I have no great opinion of them alone. Nor have I an higher opinion of vinegar: my people had it very &s;paringly during the late voyage; and towards the latter part, none at all; and yet we experienced no ill effects from the want of it. The cu&s;tom of wa&s;hing the in&s;ide of the &s;hip with vinegar I &s;eldom ob&s;erved, thinking, that fire and &s;moak an&s;wered the purpo&s;e much better."</Q>
</LETTER>
<P>To the above we &s;hall &s;ubjoin the following re|marks on Captain Cook's judicious procedure; with &s;ome other intere&s;ting particulars; being a &s;ummary of the di&s;covery of the great anti&s;corbutic virtues of &s;weet-wort by Dr. Macbride, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>"CAPTAIN COOK begins his lift of &s;tores with
<PB N="11" REF="11"><HI>malt:</HI> "Of this," he &s;ays, "was made &s;weet-wort, and given not only to tho&s;e men who had manife&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;curvy, but to &s;uch al&s;o as were judged to be the mo&s;t liable to it."</Q> Dr. Macbride, who fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this preparation, was led, as he &s;ays, to the di&s;covery by &s;ome experiments that had been laid before the Royal Society; by which it appeared, that the air produced by alimentary fermentation was endowed with a power of correcting putrefaction. The fact he confirmed by numerous trials, and finding this fluid to be <HI>fixed air,</HI> he ju&s;tly concluded, that whatever &s;ub&s;tance proper for food abounded with it, and which could be conveniently carried to &s;ea, would make one of the be&s;t provi&s;ions again&s;t the &s;curvy; which he then con&s;idered as a putrid di&s;ea&s;e, and as &s;uch to be prevented or cured by that powerful kind of anti&s;eptic. Beer, for in&s;tance, hath always been e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t anti&s;corbutics; but as that derived all its <HI>fixed air</HI> from the malt of which it is made, he inferred, that malt it&s;elf was preferable in long voyages, as it took up le&s;s room than the brewed li|quor, and would keep longer &s;ound. Experience hath &s;ince verified this ingenious theory, and the malt hath now gained to much credit in the navy, that there only wanted &s;o long, &s;o healthful, and &s;o cele|brated a voyage as this, to rank it among the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able articles of provi&s;ion. For though Cap|tain Cook remarks, that <Q>"a proper attention to other things mu&s;t be joined, and that he is not altogether of opinion, that the wort will be able to cure the &s;curvy in an advanced &s;tate at &s;ea; yet he is per|&s;uaded, that it is &s;ufficient to prevent that di&s;tem|per from making any great progre&s;s, for a con|&s;iderable time;"</Q> and therefore he doth not he&s;i|tate to pronounce it, <Q>"one of the be&s;t anti&s;corbutic medicines yet found out."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;alutary <HI>gas,</HI> or <HI>fixed air,</HI> is contained more
<PB N="12" REF="12">or le&s;s in all fermentable liquors, and begins to op|po&s;e putrefaction as &s;oon as the working or inte&s;tine motion commences.</P>
<P>In wine it abounds, and perhaps no vegetable &s;ub|&s;tance is more replete with it than the fruit of the vine. If we join the grateful ta&s;te of wine, we mu&s;t rank it fir&s;t in the li&s;t of anti&s;corbutic liquors. Cyder is likewi&s;e good, with other vinous produc|tions from fruit, as al&s;o the various kinds of beer. It hath been a con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, that in long cruizes or di&s;tant voyages, the &s;curvy is never &s;een whil&s;t the &s;mall-beer holds out at a full allowance; but that when it is all expended, the di&s;order &s;oon ap|pears. It were therefore to be wi&s;hed, that this mo&s;t whole&s;ome beverage could be renewed at &s;ea; but our &s;hips afford not &s;ufficient convenience. The Ru&s;&s;ians however make a &s;hift to prepare at &s;ea, as well as at land, a liquor of a middle quality between wort and &s;mall-beer, in the following manner. They take ground malt and rye meal in a certain proportion, which they knead into &s;mall loaves, and bake in the oven. The&s;e they occa&s;ionally infu&s;e in a proper quantity of warm water, which begins &s;o &s;oon to fer|ment, that in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours their brewage is compleated, in the production of a &s;mall, bri&s;k, and acidulous liquor, which they call <HI>quas,</HI> palatable to them&s;elves, and not di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te of &s;trangers. The late Dr. Moun&s;ey, member of the Royal Society, who had lived long in Ru&s;&s;ia, and had been <HI>Archiater</HI> under two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns, &s;ays, that the <HI>quas</HI> was the common and whole|&s;ome drink both of the fleets and armies of that em|pire, and that it was particularly good again&s;t the &s;curvy. He added, that happening to be at Mo&s;cow when he peru&s;ed the "Ob&s;ervations on the Jail-Fever," publi&s;hed here, he had been induced to compare what he read in that treati&s;e with what he
<PB N="13" REF="13">&s;hould &s;ee in the &s;everal pri&s;ons of that large city: but to his &s;urprize, after vi&s;iting them all, and find|ing them full of malefactors, for the late empre&s;s then &s;uffered none of tho&s;e who were convicted of capital crimes to be put to death, yet he could di&s;|cover no fever among them, nor learn that any acute di&s;temper peculiar to jails had ever been known there. He ob&s;erved that &s;ome of tho&s;e places of confine|ment had a yard, into which the pri&s;oners were al|lowed to come for the air; but that there were others without this advantage, yet not &s;ickly: &s;o that he could a&s;&s;ign no other rea&s;on for the health|ful condition of tho&s;e men than the kind of diet they u&s;ed; which was the &s;ame with that of the common people of the country, who not being able to pur|cha&s;e fle&s;h-meat live mo&s;tly on rye-bread, (the mo&s;t ace&s;cent of any bread) and drink <HI>quas.</HI> He con|cluded with &s;aying, that upon his return to Peter&s;|burg, he had made the &s;ame enquiry there, and with the &s;ame re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Thus far my informer: from who&s;e account it would appear, that the rye-meal a&s;&s;i&s;ted both in quickening the fermentation, and adding more fixed air; &s;ince the malt alone could not &s;o readily pro|duce &s;o acidulous and bri&s;k a liquor. And there is little doubt, but that whenever the other grains can be brought to a proper degree of fermentation, they will more or le&s;s in the &s;ame way become u&s;eful. That oats will, I am &s;atisfied, from what I have been told by one of the intelligent friends of Captain Cook. This gentleman being on a cruize in a large &s;hip, in the beginning of the late war, and the &s;curvy breaking out among his crew, he bethought him&s;elf of a kind of food, he had &s;een u&s;ed in &s;ome parts of the country, as the mo&s;t proper on this occa&s;ion. Some oatmeal is put into a wooden ve&s;&s;el, hot water is poured upon it, and the infu&s;ion continues until
<PB N="14" REF="14">the liquor begins to ta&s;te &s;ouri&s;h; that is, till a fer|mentation comes on, which in a place moderately warm may be in the &s;pace of two days. The water is then poured off from the grounds, and boiled down to the con&s;i&s;tence of a jelly. This he ordered to be made, and dealt out in me&s;&s;es, being fir&s;t &s;weet|ened with &s;ugar, and &s;ea&s;oned with &s;ome prize-wine he had taken, which, though turned &s;our, yet improved the ta&s;te, and made this aliment no le&s;s palatable than medicinal.</P>

<HEAD>FEVERS.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="symptoms">
<HEAD>SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two principal &s;ources of fevers, one comprehends the cau&s;es which render the blood and other fluids of the body too thick; the other includes tho&s;e which make them too thin. Let us now exa|mine how one &s;ort may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that in all fevers of every kind, there is a morbid or malignant quality intro|duced and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the blood as the productive cau&s;e; and the proper means for curing them are &s;uch methods and medicines as by experience have been found effectual for removing their morbid qua|lity, and recovering the &s;ick in the &s;horte&s;t time.</P>
<P>In &s;ome per&s;ons, when there is too much blood, &s;uch bleeding may be advi&s;ed as will draw off the exce&s;s, except in pe&s;tilential di&s;tempers, in which blood-letting has proved almo&s;t always mortal, even in the bodies fulle&s;t of blood; this evacuation mu&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="17">be moderately u&s;ed in pleuri&s;ies, as the extremity of pain and difficulty of breathing &s;hall acquire it.</P>
<P>That the common people (who generally know when per&s;ons have fevers) may have a little more knowledge of the&s;e acute di&s;ea&s;es, and how to di&s;|tingui&s;h one kind of them from the other; the per|&s;on who is to direct for the &s;ick, &s;hould carefully enquire into the &s;tate of his body; he &s;hould exa|mine his pul&s;e. Let him feel the pul&s;e of two or three that are in health, and his own pul&s;e; and then compare them with the pul&s;e of the patient, and thereby he will come nearly to know how much it differs from the healthful &s;tandard, as to quickne&s;s or &s;lowne&s;s, and as to its &s;trength and weakne&s;s, and be able to deduce &s;ome conclu&s;ions which may guide his conduct; then let him learn the degree of febrile heat; and one way to do this may be by feeling the &s;ide of the neck below the ears (through which the large blood ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s to and from the brain) and thus the degree of the heat of the blood may be known; and the other &s;ymptoms of the patient &s;hould be particularly enquired into.</P>
<P>If the heat of the body be exce&s;&s;ive, the pul&s;e quick and &s;trong, the fle&s;h very dry, the pores of the &s;kin very clo&s;e, and the thir&s;t very great, it may be concluded that the cau&s;e which produced that fever has rendered the blood too thick.</P>
<P>If the pul&s;e is too quick, and not &s;trong, and the heat of the body not great; if the tongue is very black or dry, and the thir&s;t is great, or it the patient voids blood by urine, or &s;pitting, or at his no&s;e, or by &s;tool; or if he has flat &s;pots on his &s;kin, black or reddi&s;h in colour, or if he has a great loo&s;ene&s;s, with watery or thin &s;tools; or if he has profu&s;e &s;weats, with a &s;en&s;ible &s;inking of his &s;pirits, and decrea&s;e of &s;trength, it may be in&s;erted, that the fever is of a putrid kind.</P>

<P>THE following general rules &s;hould be ob&s;erved: to drink as plentifully as po&s;&s;ible &s;ome diluting liquor whenever thir&s;ty, &s;uch as barley-water, mint and balm and &s;age tea, thin water-gruel, or beef tea made as follows:</P>
<P>Take a pound of lean beef, out it &s;mall, pour upon it two quarts of water, boil it for the &s;pace of five minutes, then keep for u&s;e.</P>
<P>To u&s;e &s;uch nutritious food, as mo&s;t freely may be taken, becau&s;e it abates the acrimony of the blood, repairs the wa&s;te of the body, and is one of the be&s;t cordials; &s;mall whey made with Canary or Mountain wine may be frequently u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary, before we proceed farther, to premi&s;e that in liquid, by four table &s;poonfuls, is meant half a gill, or two ounces; two &s;poonfuls one ounce, one &s;poonful half an ounce, or four drachms.</P>
<P>If &s;eized with any feveri&s;h complaint, take the fol|lowing mixture.</P>
<P>Salt of wormwood, two drachms, lemon juice, or any acid, a &s;ufficient quantity to make a neutral me|dicine, &s;ugar about two drachms, common water about half a pint, and about two ounces of nutmeg water, or any &s;pirit; mix together, and take two &s;poonfuls every three hours.</P>
<P>At night take a little &s;weat going to re&s;t, and the next morning continue the mixture. Or if incon|venient to make up the above medicine, or too poor to get it, we recommend Salt Petre as an efficacious as well as cheap remedy.</P>
<P>We &s;hall mention one in&s;tance of its utility. A poor woman a&s;ked advice for her hu&s;band (a man about forty years of age) who had a fever, with a violent pain in his &s;ide, and was light-headed at times.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="19">
<P>We advi&s;ed her to get an ounce of &s;alt-petre, and powder it; then to divide it into four equal parts, and each of them into four others for &s;o many do&s;es, each of which will contain about half a drachm, directing that &s;he &s;hould give one of them, di&s;&s;olved in a coffee di&s;h of &s;age tea, &s;weetened with &s;ugar to his palate every three or four hours; and when he had taken this &s;alt, &s;he came and &s;aid, that his fever was gone; but that his cough remained. We then advi&s;ed her to give him about twenty drops of bal&s;am capivi, with powder &s;ugar, night and morning; and he happily recovered.</P>
<P>But if troubled with a cough, add, of &s;perma-ceti in powder two drachms; di&s;&s;olved with the yolk of an egg, to be taken in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Or, if that cannot be had, the following powder.</P>
<P>Take &s;perma-ceti in powder, half an ounce; &s;ugar and &s;alt-petre each two drachms; mixt together, and take as much as will lay on a &s;hilling every three or four hours in any liquid.</P>
<P>If bound, take the following opening mixture.</P>
<P>Take two drachms of &s;enna leaves, boil in ten ounces of common water to eight ounces; &s;train off, and add manna half an ounce, tincture of &s;enna one ounce; mix, and take two table &s;poonfuls every three hours, till it operates.</P>
<P>This medicine is ea&s;ily prepared, and very handy on many occa&s;ions, e&s;pecially when the body calls for a remedy of this nature; it is cooling as well as lax|ative; wa&s;hes its pa&s;&s;age through the bowels, without any griping or di&s;order, and &s;tands in need at the &s;ame time of no over &s;trict regimen.</P>

<HEAD>Of an Acute Inflammatory Fever.</HEAD>
<P>THE young, robu&s;t plethoric habit, will ever be mo&s;t liable to inflammations; whil&s;t, on, the contrary,
<PB N="20" REF="20">in the weakly and infirm, the circulation cannot readily be worked up to &s;uch a pitch as is requi&s;ite to con&s;titute a di&s;ea&s;e of an inflammatory kind; in both, cold or ob&s;tructed per&s;piration is almo&s;t the only occa&s;ional cau&s;e.

<P>To the cure of an inflammatory fever therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, to take away about &s;ix or eight ounces of blood, then give about fifteen grains of Ipecacuanha in a cup of any liquid, and work it off with camomile flower tea, having nothing after it that night, but a little mulled wine to &s;ettle the &s;tomach.</P>

<HEAD>Of a nervous Fever.</HEAD>
<P>THIS low nervous fever is directly oppo&s;ite to the acute inflammatory, and therefore mu&s;t be dif|ferently treated.</P>
<P>It mo&s;tly happens from profu&s;e evacuations, and to tho&s;e of relaxed &s;olids, and di&s;&s;olved watery fluids; the pul&s;e, though quick, is here weak and low, the heat of body but little beyond the natural, and the

<P>In the one it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to lower the im|petus of the circulation, by evacuations and coolers; in the other, the warm cordial, the &s;timulating me|dicines are by all means advi&s;eable to excite the vis vitae, and promote &s;uch a degree of fever as may &s;uffice for its expul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Evacuations of blood, and by &s;tool, can then be, of no &s;ervice in the cure of a low fever, but a great detriment. A gentle vomit in the beginning, and a breathing &s;weat throughout its continuance will be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>A warm, light, nouri&s;hing diet, and plenty of generous wine will be expedient, with bli&s;ters and &s;i|napi&s;ms, or mu&s;tard plai&s;ters and other drawers of the feet, for the relief of the &s;ymptoms.</P>

<P>The doctor pre&s;cribes bleeding and bli&s;tering in the neck, and behind the ears, in order to draw off the humours from the eyes; and afterwards, accord|ing to the degree of inflammation, or acrimony of the juices, to make a drain by i&s;&s;ues between the &s;houlders, or perpetual bli&s;ter. And for wa&s;hing the eyes, recommends cold &s;pring water. And the be&s;t inward medicines, which he has experienced, to be con&s;erve of ro&s;emary flowers; anti-epileptic powders, &s;uch as Purvis ad Guttetam, betony, &s;age, ro&s;emary, eye-bright, wild valerian root, ca&s;tor, &amp;c. wa&s;hed down with a tea made of the &s;ame ingredients; as al&s;o drops of &s;pirit Lavandulae Compo&s;it, and &s;al. vol. oleos.</P>

<P>THE &s;ociety e&s;tabli&s;hed in London for the re|covery of per&s;ons apparently drowned, induced by a principle of humanity, have undertaken to make public the following methods of treating &s;uch ca&s;es, which are now practi&s;ed in &s;everal countries of Eu|rope with amazing &s;ucce&s;s; and which they earne&s;tly recommend to the attention of every man, but par|ticularly to tho&s;e who live in &s;ea-port towns, or places adjacent to rivers, brooks, ponds, &amp;c.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="method">
<HEAD>METHOD OF TREATMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. In removing the body to a convenient place, great care mu&s;t be taken that it be not brui&s;ed, nor &s;haken violently, nor roughly handled, nor carried over any one's &s;houlders with the head hanging down|wards, nor rolled upon the ground, or over a barrel, nor lifted up by the heels, except with the greate&s;t caution. For experience proves, that all the&s;e me|thods are injurious, and often de&s;troy the &s;mall re|mains of life. The unfortunate object &s;hould be cautiou&s;ly conveyed by two or more per&s;ons, or in a
<PB N="52" REF="52">carriage upon &s;traw, lying as on a bed with the head a little rai&s;ed, and kept in as natural and ea&s;y a po&s;i|tion as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="2">II. The body being well dried with a cloth, &s;hould be placed in a moderate degree of heat, but not too near a large fire. The windows or door of the room &s;hould be left open, and no more per&s;ons be admitted into it than tho&s;e who are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as the life of the patient greatly depends upon their having the benefit of a pure air. The warmth mo&s;t promi&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s is that of a bed or blanket, properly warmed. Bottles of hot water &s;hould be laid at the bottoms of the feet, in the joints of the knees, and under the arm-pits; and a warming-pan, moderately heated, or hot bricks, wrapped in cloths, &s;hould be rubbed over the body, and particularly along the back. The natural and kindly warmth of a healthy per&s;on lying by the &s;ide of the body, has been found in many ca&s;es very efficacious. The &s;hirt or cloaths of an attendant, or the &s;kin of a &s;heep fre&s;h killed, may al&s;o be u&s;ed with advantage. Should the&s;e accidents happen in the neighbourhood of a warm bath, brew-hou&s;e, baker, gla&s;s-hou&s;e, &s;altern, &s;oap-boiler, or any fabric where warm lees, a&s;hes, embers, grains, &s;and, water, &amp;c. are ea&s;ily procured, it would be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to place the body in any of the&s;e, moderated to a degree of heat, but very little exceeding that of a healthy per&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;ubject being placed in one or other of the&s;e advantageous circum&s;tances, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, va|rious &s;timulating methods &s;hould next be employed. The mo&s;t efficacious are, to blow with force into the lungs, by applying the mouth to that part of the patient, clo&s;ing his no&s;trils with one hand, and gently expel|ling the air again by pre&s;&s;ing the che&s;t with the other, imitating the &s;trong breathing of a healthy per&s;on: the medium of a handkerchief or cloth may be u&s;ed
<PB N="53" REF="53">to render the operation le&s;s indelicate. Whil&s;t one a&s;&s;i&s;tant is con&s;tantly employed in this operation, an|other &s;hould throw the &s;moak of tobacco up by the fundament into the bowels, by means of a pipe or fumigator, &s;uch as are u&s;ed in admini&s;tering cly&s;ters: a pair of bellows may be u&s;ed until the others can be procured. A third attendant &s;hould, in the mean time, rub the belly, che&s;t, back and arms, with a coar&s;e cloth or flannel dipped in brandy, rum, gin, or with dry &s;alt, &s;o as not to rub off the &s;kin: &s;pirits of hart&s;horn, volatile &s;alts, or any other &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tance, mu&s;t al&s;o be applied to the no&s;trils, and rubbed upon the temples very frequently. The body mu&s;t at intervals be &s;haken al&s;o, and varied in its po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If there be any &s;igns of returning life, &s;uch as &s;ighing, ga&s;ping, twitching, or any convul&s;ive motions, beating of the heart, the return of the na|tural colour and warmth; opening a vein in the arm or neck may prove beneficial, but the quantity of blood taken away &s;hould not be large; nor &s;hould any artery ever be opened, as profu&s;e bleeding has appeared prejudicial, and even de&s;tructive to the &s;mall remains of life. The throat &s;hould be tickled with a feather, in order to excite a propen&s;ity to vomit; and the no&s;trils al&s;o with a feather, &s;nuff, or any other &s;timulant, &s;o as to provoke &s;neezings. A tea-&s;poonful of warm water may be admini&s;tered now and then, in order to learn whether the power of &s;wallowing be returned: and if it be, a table-&s;poon|ful of warm wine, or brandy and water, may be given with advantage, but not before, as the liquor might get into the lungs before the power of &s;wallow|ing returns. The other methods &s;hould be continued with vigour, until the patient be gradually re&s;tored.</P>
<P>We have been as circum&s;tantial as po&s;&s;ible in the above directions, that if one conveniency &s;hould be
<PB N="54" REF="54">wanting, the attendants may not be at a lo&s;s for others. Where the patient has lain but a &s;hort time &s;en&s;ele&s;s, blowing into the lungs or bowels has been, in &s;ome ca&s;es, found &s;ufficient; yet a &s;peedy recovery is not to be expected in general. On the contrary, the above methods are to be continued with &s;pirit for two hours, or upwards, although there &s;hould not be the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms of returning life. The vulgar notion; that a per&s;on will recover in a few minutes, or not at all; and the ignorant, fooli&s;h ridiculing of tho&s;e who are willing to per&s;evere, as if they were attempting impo&s;&s;ibilities, has mo&s;t certainly cau&s;ed the death of many who might other|wi&s;e have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the above rules are happily of &s;uch a nature, that they may be begun immediately, and that by per&s;ons who are not acquainted with the me|dical art; yet it is always advi&s;eable to &s;eek the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome regular practitioner as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible; not only as bleeding is proper, and frequently nece&s;&s;ary; but as it is to be pre&s;umed that &s;uch a one will be more &s;kilful and expert, and better able to vary the methods of procedure as circum&s;tances may require.</P>
<P>N. B. It is proper to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e means of re&s;toration are applicable to various other ca&s;es of apparent deaths; &s;uch as hanging, &s;uffocation by damp and noxious vapours, whether proceeding from coal-mines, the confined air of wells, ci&s;terns, caves, or the mu&s;t of fermenting liquors; to tho&s;e &s;eized with apoplectic and convul&s;ive fits, and al&s;o to the frozen.</P>
<P>Wherever any good has been produced by the means recommended, the per&s;on who has &s;uperintended the cure is de&s;ired to write a circum&s;tantial account of it to James Horsfall, E&s;q; Trea&s;urer, Middle Temple, or Mr. M.

<PB N="56" REF="56" MS="y">are ab&s;olutely owing to too great a quantity of blood; in which ca&s;e there is ever of cour&s;e an indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity for proportionably draining this fluid.</P>
<P>In all inflammatory di&s;tempers, it is next kin to a &s;acrilege to omit it: as it is, on the contrary, ex|po&s;ing the patient to the utmo&s;t hazard, to injoin it in a low, languid, depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, where the &s;pirits before were too much exhau&s;ted, and nature, con|&s;equently, unable to &s;upport the lea&s;t evacuation.</P>
<P>In a word, wherever prevail &s;ore-eyes, a &s;ciatic, a dry, hu&s;ky cough, an head-ach, inflammations of the womb, or bladder, a virulent gonorrhoea, cordee, venereal &s;tricture, inflamed piles, hot rheumati&s;m, dry gripes, &s;ore throat, an a&s;thma, cholic, &s;trangury, gravel, nephretic pains, haemorrhages, an inveterate itch, and the like, the opening of a vein is of peculiar &s;ervice. But in drop&s;ies, a jaundice, the gout, and all complaints ari&s;ing from too great a relaxation of the ve&s;&s;els, or ob&s;truction of them, remedies adapted to the re&s;pective di&s;orders mu&s;t be &s;ought for from other &s;pecific quarters, without the lea&s;t thought of increa&s;ing tho&s;e di&s;orders, by abrupt and prepo&s;terous bleeding.</P>
