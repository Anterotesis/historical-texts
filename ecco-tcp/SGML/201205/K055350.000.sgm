<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in India are now become &s;o exten&s;ive as to require for their defence a numerous body of our countrymen; many of whom, from the in|fluence of a new and injurious climate, as well as other unfavourable changes, fall victims to the con&s;equences of emigration. The prevention of this fatality may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, exceed the utmo&s;t efforts of medicine; but it is certain that in others, and tho&s;e by far the greate&s;t number, the operation of the cau&s;es above-mentioned prove chiefly delete|rious from the imperfect knowledge hitherto attained of the nature of di&s;ea&s;es in India. Among tho&s;e to which Europeans are parti|cularly expo&s;ed, the mo&s;t common, and perhaps likewi&s;e the mo&s;t fatal, is the He|patitis, or Inflammation of the Liver; an accurate inve&s;tigation of which mu&s;t there|fore
<PB N="viii" REF="5">be an object of the fir&s;t importance to every practitioner in that country.</P>
<P>There are as yet only three publications on this di&s;ea&s;e in England, and they are defec|tive, as they were given by their authors, in con&s;equence of &s;ome ca&s;es which they met with at &s;ea; incon&s;iderable either in number or variety when compared with tho&s;e which happen in the field.</P>
<P>The Author of the pre&s;ent Treati&s;e landed in India with the care of a thou&s;and of his Maje&s;ty's troops, and other regiments fell to his charge. He thus had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the Hepatitis in all it's varie|ties of form, and of attending minutely to it's phoenomena.</P>
<P>This led him to attempt an innovation in the practice, which he found &s;ucce&s;sful for the la&s;t nine months of his continuance in that country.</P>
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
<P>Since his E&s;&s;ay on the Hepatitis has been in the pre&s;s, the report of four new-rai&s;ed regiments being to be &s;ent to India, has induced him to add an E&s;&s;ay on the Spa&s;|modic Affections, which pre&s;ented them|&s;elves immediately on the arrival of the troops with whom he landed in that country.</P>
<P>Spa&s;ms are very likely to be the fir&s;t di&s;ea&s;es of Europeans in India. And as the Author recollects no Engli&s;h Treati&s;e on the Spa&s;ms in India drawn from per&s;onal ob&s;ervation, he has given the annexed conci&s;e account, rather than delay it's publi|cation until he could find lei&s;ure to enlarge upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He has however omitted nothing either in the Hepatitis or Spa&s;ms which he can think of that has any immediate reference to the practical parts of the&s;e &s;ubjects; though he is far from entertaining the idea that he
<PB N="x" REF="7">has at length exhau&s;ted either of them by his own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>He tru&s;ts that the endeavour to furni&s;h the officer and inexperienced practitioner to the&s;e climates with the means of preventing and of curing two of the mo&s;t formidable di&s;ea&s;es of the Ea&s;t, will amply apologize for the numerous defects which a critical reader may, no doubt, di&s;cern in the follow|ing pages.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE HEPATITIS IN INDIA.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are conver&s;ant in medi|cal writings, or have attended much to di&s;&s;ections in ho&s;pitals, know in how many patients the liver, which had never been &s;u&s;pected of any di&s;ea&s;e, has been found, after death, in a morbid &s;tate. It is a fact, that, in a great number of &s;uch ca&s;es, the affected part has gone through all the different &s;tages of the latent di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="10">without ever exhibiting any of the &s;ymp|toms by which we are taught, in the de|&s;cription of no&s;ologi&s;ts, to di&s;tingui&s;h it.</P>
<P>Without paying any regard to defini|tions, I &s;hall therefore proceed to a faithful relation of the Hepatitis, as it appeared in &s;everal hundreds of the men and officers, during and after a campaign of twenty-two months, in the Carnatic and Tanjore countries of India.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is more common to the military than to any other &s;et of people, and to tho&s;e e&s;pecially who &s;erve on the Coromandel coa&s;t, as in this quarter the fatigues of the troops are the greate&s;t. In Bengal, where all the expeditions are car|ried on only by water, in ve&s;&s;els covered from the rays of the &s;un, and where the provi&s;ions are better and more regularly &s;upplied, di&s;ea&s;ed livers are much le&s;s fre|quent. From the hi&s;tory of this di&s;ea&s;e, it will appear not to be &s;o acute as is gene|rally imagined; but that it may, and very
<PB N="9" REF="11">often does, continue in a chronic &s;tate, for weeks, months, &s;ometimes years, and becomes &s;uddenly acute by intemperance in drinking, or the improper u&s;e of mer|cury. The &s;ymptoms of vomiting, hic|cup, or pain of the &s;ide or &s;houlder, too generally imagined to be nece&s;&s;ary at|tendants of this di&s;ea&s;e, will not be found to have accompanied one half of the ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;ed liver, which have gone through all their different &s;tages.</P>
<P>Without taking any notice of the gene|ral pathology of the di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hall divide the phenomena into three &s;tages, viz. the chronic, acute, and &s;uppurative; and de|&s;cribe them in the order in which they appeared. To prove the acute &s;tage not to be al&s;o a &s;uppurative one, I have no facts. But as one of the&s;e &s;tages always yields to a-peculiar treatment, and the other &s;eldom to any, the di&s;tinction may not be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<HEAD>THE FIRST, OR CHRONIC STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR &s;ome time before the pain of the &s;houlder and &s;ide becomes violent, the animal &s;pirits are much dimini&s;hed: the &s;tools begin to be very irregular, &s;ome days &s;carce any, at others very profu&s;e and acrid: the countenance is tumid and bloated. Sometimes the tunica albuginea of the eyes is yellow, but more commonly of a dull white appearance. The &s;kin, e&s;pecially of the mu&s;cular parts of the body, is dry and &s;qualid.</P>
<P>The urine is generally more or le&s;s high coloured, and &s;mall in quantity; the per|&s;piration &s;canty and partial; the tongue dry with thir&s;t. The &s;tomach is extremely variable: frequently, before dinner, there is a momentary &s;ickne&s;s, which is almo&s;t as in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by a &s;en&s;ation of hunger. After eating, all the&s;e &s;ymptoms
<PB N="11" REF="13">are alleviated for an hour or two, and then &s;ucceeded, either by heartburn or pain|ful gripes; the pul&s;e is &s;mall, hard, and quick, e&s;pecially towards the evening; the gums contract a hardne&s;s; the &s;houlders appear daily more elevated. In many there is a dull pain in the lumbar region.</P>
<P>After the&s;e &s;ymptoms have continued for &s;ome time, an induration of a part of the liver may be &s;ometimes felt, by laying the patient on his back, with the head low, and the knees a little elevated. The patient frequently continues in this &s;tate for a con&s;iderable time, until the dejection of &s;pirits, which always more or le&s;s at|tends this di&s;ea&s;e, prompts him to the im|moderate u&s;e of wine, which &s;carcely ever fails to accelerate the approach of the acute or inflammatory &s;tage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="14">
<HEAD>THE SECOND, OR INFLAMMATORY STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE countenance, which, from the beginning of the preceding &s;tage, had contracted a morbid appearance, becomes now, at intervals, more florid than was common to the patient even in his be&s;t health. The &s;tools are &s;mall, frequent, and re&s;embling tho&s;e in the dy&s;entery. The pain of the &s;houlder and &s;ide, which before was obtu&s;e and &s;hifting, e&s;pecially that of the former, becomes &s;uddenly very acute. When this pain of the &s;houlder is felt, it always corre&s;ponds with that part of the liver which is mo&s;t immediately di&s;ea&s;ed; being more or le&s;s anteriorly or po&s;teriorly &s;ituated, according as the ante|rior or po&s;terior parts of the liver are the &s;eat of the complaint: and with the left lobe the left &s;houlder is frequently af|fected. In this &s;tage the pain of the
<PB N="13" REF="15">&s;houlder is frequently increa&s;ed on every motion of the diaphragm, attended with a trouble&s;ome &s;hort cough, and catching of the breath, in in&s;pirations, as well as an increa&s;ed pain on the region of the liver being touched. Sometimes the ea&s;ie&s;t po|&s;ition is on the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ide, at other times on the oppo&s;ite; but more commonly on the back, with the head rather low. The Hepatitis, in this &s;tage, begins its attack as often with a flux and tene&s;mus as with a fixed pain of the &s;houlder; and in this ca&s;e the per&s;on falls a &s;acrifice to a mi&s;taken conception of the di&s;ea&s;e. Un|der this fallacious appearance the &s;ick is commonly relieved by &s;alts, or &s;ome gen|tle laxatives, until, the acute &s;tage being palliated, the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umes the primitive chronic form; in which &s;tate he continues with irregular &s;ecretions, the urine high coloured, the countenance of a &s;allow complexion, and every day impre&s;&s;ed with an air of additional melancholy. Many unfortunate per&s;ons, driven to de&s;pair, by the continuance of the complaint for one
<PB N="14" REF="16">or two years, have at length peri&s;hed by violent means, which their ungovernable impatience had &s;ugge&s;ted. The period mo&s;t u&s;ually fatal is the acce&s;&s;ion of the third &s;tage, which is ha&s;tened by the u&s;e both of a&s;tringents and bitters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE THIRD, OR SUPPURATIVE STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>IN a few days or weeks after the dy&s;en|teric &s;ymptoms have abated, the patient becomes &s;o tired of the loo&s;ene&s;s which remains, that he is de&s;irous of having it flopped. For this purpo&s;e, the common practice is to order a&s;tringents or bitters, which indeed &s;oon check the loo&s;ene&s;s; but, in a &s;hort time after, he is attacked with a deep hollow-&s;ounding cough, from that &s;ide of the lungs which corre&s;ponds to the lobe of the liver mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="17">
<P>Whenever the cough commences the greate&s;t part of that &s;ide of the liver is generally occupied with an ab&s;ce&s;s, by which its &s;ub&s;tance is already con&s;umed; though this purulent collection &s;eldom gave any token of its exi&s;tence, until it had opened to it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age through the dia|phragm and lungs, or into the cavity of the abdomen. In this emergency the patient is either &s;uffocated by the &s;udden inundation of the lungs, or mi&s;erably ex|pires by the more &s;low effects of incurable inanition, which is promoted by an uncon|cocted di&s;charge of the aliments, accom|panied with flatulence and gripes.</P>
<P>Where no a&s;tringents have been given, there are &s;ometimes di&s;covered more &s;u|perficial &s;uppurations, which are ea&s;ily opened with the knife, and cured in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e which &s;ucceed the &s;udden &s;toppage of the loo&s;ene&s;s, when this inci|dent is attended with a deep hollow-&s;ound|ing
<PB N="16" REF="18">cough, prove equally mortal, whether they point outwardly or penetrate the cavities.</P>
<P>In the&s;e forms the Hepatitis mo&s;t com|monly made its appearance. But there is another &s;hape, under which it remained for years, without running into the more acute &s;tages, e&s;pecially among the natives and tho&s;e Europeans who had arrived in the country at a very early period. This form is that of an intermittent fever, irregular in its acce&s;&s;ions, &s;ometimes u&s;hered in by a cold, though oftener only by a hot &s;tage; but never without the pul&s;e becoming &s;maller and quicker: the duration of the hot or &s;weating &s;tage likewi&s;e bearing no proportion to the length or &s;hortne&s;s of the cold one. It is called the Hill-fever, from its being endemic in the hilly parts of the Carnatic; and is often con&s;idered as incurable.</P>
<P>In all the ca&s;es I have &s;een of this kind the livers were di&s;ea&s;ed, e&s;pecially the left
<PB N="17" REF="19">lobes; and the patients were re&s;tored to health only by treating their complaints as di&s;ea&s;ed livers.</P>
<P>Authors generally mention vomitings as concomitant &s;ymptoms when the concave parts, and hiccups, when the convex parts of the liver are di&s;ea&s;ed. But I have &s;een both parts impo&s;thumated without either of the&s;e &s;ymptoms; and indeed have very &s;eldom met with them in any hepatic complaints. A nau&s;ea and want of appe|tite are much more common in the latter &s;tages of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The pain in this di&s;ea&s;e is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to an adhe&s;ion of the convex part of the liver to the peritoneum; the con&s;equence of which is, that the patients are induced to lie on the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ide. But when the concave part is affected, to recline on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide is an ea&s;ier &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Mr. Matthews has remarked that only per&s;ons in whom the thorax is narrow have
<PB N="18" REF="20">any pain in the epiga&s;tric, and tho&s;e in whom it is broad, in the lumbar region</P>
<P>But, as far as I ever could ob&s;erve, the&s;e pains alternated in each of the patients independently of any difference in the con|formation of the che&s;t.</P>
<P>Whether the pain of the &s;houlder ari&s;es from the adhe&s;ion to the diaphragm, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, or from the junction of the phrenic nerve, with the third and fourth of the cervical, I cannot pretend to &s;ay; but that it does not depend always upon the enlargement of the liver, I can with great confidence affirm; having &s;een many amazingly enlarged, by ab&s;ce&s;&s;es formed in them, where this &s;ymptom had never been ob&s;erved by the patients.</P>
<P>The free de&s;cent of the tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ep|tum, upon which re&s;piration much depends, being impeded, a greater or le&s;s degree of dy&s;pnoea mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<P>Though no per&s;ons, after the age of puberty, are exempted from this di&s;ea&s;e, when expo&s;ed to the operation of the ex|citing cau&s;es, I have ob&s;erved that tho&s;e of a &s;anguine temperament were more frequently afflicted than any other.</P>
<P>I never yet &s;aw the di&s;ea&s;e in any who was not an adult. Out of twenty drum|mers of the 101&s;t regiment, under the age of puberty, not one was &s;eized with it, though they were con&s;tantly in the field, and performed their marches more regularly than any other part of the regiment.</P>
<P>The particular circum&s;tances to which our army was expo&s;ed were the following, which I have therefore ventured to a&s;&s;ign as the remote cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e:</P>
<LG>
<L>A hot climate,</L>
<L>Injuries of the cranium from the rays of the &s;un,</L>
<L>Abu&s;e of &s;pirits,</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;ions of the mind,</L>
<PB N="20" REF="22">
<L>Violent exerci&s;e,</L>
<L>Bad water,</L>
<L>Want of vegetables,</L>
<L>Great repletion after long fa&s;ting,</L>
<L>Abu&s;e of Mercury.</L>
</LG>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HEAT.</HEAD>
<P>HEAT being one of the mo&s;t univer|&s;al of all &s;timulants, has frequently pro|duced the be&s;t effects, by increa&s;ing all the &s;ecretions: but though moderate heat, like moderate drinking, be frequently &s;alu|tary, extreme heat, like abu&s;es of dram|drinking, always leaves the &s;y&s;tem more languid, and con&s;equently the &s;ecretions le&s;s copious. And, as the circulation through the liver is naturally languid, this organ is, of all the bowels, the fir&s;t to feel the&s;e effects.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="21" REF="23">
<HEAD>RAYS OF THE SUN.</HEAD>
<P>THE rays of the &s;un on the &s;cull prove &s;till a greater &s;timulus to the brain, &s;o as frequently to produce in&s;tantaneous death. Whenever per&s;ons e&s;caped with moderate <HI>&s;un-&s;trokes,</HI> they often had at fir&s;t increa&s;ed &s;ecretions of bile, which were &s;ucceeded by a proportionable deficiency. The &s;ame effect happens frequently in fractured &s;culls. At fir&s;t there is a profu&s;ion of bile, then very little; and &s;ometimes it is followed by ab&s;ce&s;&s;es; of which there are in&s;tances given by Pegreas, Ballonius, Slegius, Pou|teau, Vel&s;chius, Par&eacute;, Greaume, Bino&s;|quius, Marmannus, De Merchettes, Char|rier&eacute;, Job.

<HEAD>PASSIONS OF THE MIND.</HEAD>
<P>THE melancholy which takes place in the Hepatitis, the diminution of bile in melancholy, the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile from anger, &s;un-&s;trokes and injuries of the cranium, with their con&s;equences, all &s;erve to prove a remarkable &s;ympathy be|tween the liver and brain. I am therefore inclined to believe, that, next to the rays of the &s;un and exce&s;&s;es in &s;pirituous liquors, all the depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions are to be con&s;i|dered as the mo&s;t certain remote cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The melancholy which often attends people in Britain, after very active lives in A&s;ia, is generally attributed to moral cau&s;es. But perhaps the phy|&s;ical cau&s;es may have a far greater &s;hare in its pro|duction than has been commonly imagined. A certain gloom appears to be in&s;eparable from a di&s;ea&s;ed liver. Few per&s;ons who have been long in that country, expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un by long marches, who&s;e livers are not in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;ea&s;e. But admitting this not to be the ca&s;e, it has, in the former part of this treati&s;e, been ob|&s;erved that the dark haired and melancholic habits re&s;i&s;t the fatigues be&s;t; of cour&s;e they are the mo&s;t likely to revi&s;it their native country; and they &s;eldom return to Europe until they are able to live luxuriou&s;ly; where, from being accu&s;tomed to all the violent &s;timuli in nature, they come to &s;ink into a &s;tate of ea&s;e and luxury in a country where double their former exerci&s;e had need to be exerted to prevent the powers of the climate, which are now to them become depre&s;&s;ing.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>BAD WATER.</HEAD>
<P>CLEGHORN ob&s;erves that, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Minorca, where the waters are bad, tumefied &s;pleens and livers are common both to men and brutes.</P>
<P>The badne&s;s of the Carnatic waters may be &s;ufficient argument for cla&s;&s;ing it as a cau&s;e, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the great quantities of it which the men were obliged to drink from the extreme heat of the climate.</P>

<HEAD>CHANGE OF DIET.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY change of diet, from a long continued one, &s;eems to act as a &s;timulus on the biliary ducts.</P>
<P>The officers and men who were pri&s;oners in chains with Tippo-Saib, in the Ea&s;t Indies, were allowed only rice, water, and cap&s;icum, for the many months they were with him.</P>
<P>When they were relea&s;ed, the animal food of every kind which they attempted to eat, purged them &s;o violently that they could take it only in the smalle&s;t quantities for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h fleet not appearing with the &s;tore-&s;hips, the army was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of living almo&s;t entirely on animal food. The natives of the army, who&s;e cu&s;tomary diet is chiefly rice, were all purged by this change.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="27">
<P>The like happens both to men and officers, after living &s;ome months at &s;ea on the &s;ame diet; on making a port, the ve|getables always produce &s;uch copious &s;ecre|tions of bile as oblige them to be moderate in their u&s;e.</P>
<P>The patent dried cabbage was laid in for the u&s;e of the 101&s;t regiment. They had none of it for the fir&s;t month of the voyage; but as &s;oon as they began to eat it they were all purged.</P>

<HEAD>GREAT REPLETION AFTER LONG FASTING.</HEAD>
<P>AS the troops were frequently expo&s;ed to long fa&s;ting, they were very apt to over|charge their &s;tomachs. To prove this to
<PB N="26" REF="28">be a highly debilitating cau&s;e, the following recent and well-known fact may be men|tioned. At the famine at Madras, in October 1782, &s;everal native children were taken by the Engli&s;h to their tables; by their extreme voracity, their vi&s;cera &s;oon became di&s;ea&s;ed, their bellies tumefied, and &s;chirrous indurations were to be felt in all tho&s;e who had not their diet limited for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>I &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to men|tion the effects of mercury, in treating of the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now hazard a few conjectures re|lative to the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e; though I would not be under&s;tood as being dogmatical on a point of &s;o much uncer|tainty.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a relaxation of the &s;y&s;tem, e&s;pecially of the ultimate branches of the vena portarum, the &s;ecretion of bile is not only dimini&s;hed, but that which is
<PB N="27" REF="29">&s;ecreted is more watery than u&s;ual, and le&s;s endowed with the natural qualities of the bile. On this account chylification be|comes imperfect, and all the different in|te&s;tinal phaenomena are produced. Au|thors have related the di&s;&s;ection of pa|tients affected with dy&s;enteries, who&s;e livers were found di&s;ea&s;ed; and the&s;e ap|pearances are conformable to the doctrine now mentioned. In many ca&s;es of chronic dy&s;enteries I found the livers in one of the &s;tages above de&s;cribed. The &s;pa&s;m of the colon, in tho&s;e complaints, therefore, can only be con&s;idered as the effects of the &s;tate of the bile, and not the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e. Though &s;alts frequently re|lieve the tormina and &s;pa&s;ms, they never are &s;ufficient to remove the di&s;ea&s;e, except where they induce a new and continued energy in the biliary ducts, &s;o that &s;tools copiou&s;ly and regularly charged with a deep yellow bile are produced. As a fur|ther confirmation of this opinion, I may add, that the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of the&s;e dy&s;en|teries readily yielded to the &s;ame treatment
<PB N="28" REF="30">as the Hepatitis after every other method had failed.</P>
<P>From the gradual diminution of bile in the Hepatitis, as well as the gradual dimi|nutions of energy in the &s;y&s;tem, there is every rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect: the extremities of the vena portarum to be the &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>From the few nerves &s;ent to the liver, there is but little rea&s;on to expect much energy through the medium of tho&s;e or|gans; and on account of the di&s;tance of the vena portarum from the heart, there is &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to expect much influence from a <HI>vis a tergo.</HI> Why, then, along continued weakne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem &s;hould always produce di&s;ea&s;ed livers in India, ap|pears to me not to be &s;o difficult a que&s;tion, as why the &s;ame cau&s;e &s;hould not render this a more frequent di&s;ea&s;e in other cli|mates.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the diagno&s;tic &s;ymptoms,
<PB N="29" REF="31">the pain of the &s;houlder and &s;ide, when it exi&s;ts, is a very certain characteri&s;tic of the di&s;ea&s;e; but it cannot be con&s;idered as a pathognomonic &s;ymptom, as it is by no means con&s;tant.</P>
<P>The elevation of the &s;houlders, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, was evident; but this po&s;&s;ibly may take place in other morbid affections.</P>
<P>The hardne&s;s of the gums was a very con&s;tant attendant; but this, likewi&s;e, is common to many per&s;ons, both in a &s;tate of health and di&s;ea&s;e; and therefore, of it&s;elf, can form no certain diagno&s;tic.</P>
<P>The pu&s;hing the fingers again&s;t the hy|pochondres would &s;ometimes give a &s;en&s;e of pain or itching to one of the &s;houlders. But, upon the whole, I am of opinion that the pre&s;ence of this di&s;ea&s;e can only be a&s;certained by attending to the whole &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of phaenomena; as it &s;o often exi&s;ts without the pain of the &s;ide and &s;houlder,
<PB N="30" REF="32">and as the hardne&s;s of the gums and ele|vation of the &s;houlders, appear not of them&s;elves to be evident and &s;ufficient diagno&s;tics.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage, if the cure be properly attended to, we may with certainty pro|nounce a favourable termination of the di&s;ea&s;e. We may be equally confident in the progno&s;is of the &s;econd &s;tage, when the tongue becomes furred, and the gums le&s;s hard from the treatment about to be recommended. In the third &s;tage, the tongue frequently remains clean, and the gums cannot be affected. The progno&s;is in the la&s;t &s;tage can never be favourable, unle&s;s we can be &s;ure that the &s;uppuration is &s;mall and &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>The indication of cure in this di&s;ea&s;e is to re&s;tore the energy of the &s;y&s;tem, and of the vena portarum. This may be done frequently in the fir&s;t, and &s;ometimes &s;econd &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, by change of climate, and avoiding the other remote cau&s;es. But
<PB N="31" REF="33">all the common methods u&s;ed in northern climates proved in the&s;e ca&s;es ineffectual. From &s;mall do&s;es of neutral &s;alts, &s;uch as the &s;al glauberi given at intervals, &s;o as to keep up a con&s;tant action, the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;ometimes brought back from the &s;econd &s;tage to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The vitriolic acid was tried frequently without any kind of advantage: it occa|&s;ioned an unnatural appetite, and commonly ha&s;tened the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The bark, and bitters of every kind, were attended with &s;imilar effects.</P>
<P>As the&s;e remedies have been long found to be ineffectual, practitioners of late years have had recour&s;e to mercury, introducing it to the &s;y&s;tem both by the mouth and &s;kin; and by this treatment they have be|come much more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival in India, I &s;aw &s;everal ca&s;es treated in this manner with
<PB N="32" REF="34">evident advantage. A hard gum had always been ob&s;erved to be a con&s;tant attendant on this di&s;ea&s;e. I had not &s;een many ca&s;es before I began to ob&s;erve that the patient &s;eldom or never was relieved until the gums were made &s;ore or &s;pungy; and when they could not be thus affected, a &s;uppuration almo&s;t always took place. I entertained hope that this &s;tate of the gums would fur|ni&s;h me with a certain criterion, to judge when a &s;ufficient quantity of mercury was thrown into the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of uncertainty, I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to ob&s;erve that a &s;mall quantity of mercury, taken by the mouth, affected the gums very much, and often without pro|ducing any other &s;en&s;ible alteration. On the contrary, when a large quantity was applied to the &s;kin, the time required to affect the gums was much longer, and the alterations on the &s;y&s;tem were much greater.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation fir&s;t &s;uge&s;ted to me the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, when the mercury was
<PB N="33" REF="35">introduced by the &s;tomach, it might have a tendency to pa&s;s off by the mouth before the &s;y&s;tem was much affected; whereas, when it was introduced by the &s;kin, a large quantity could be retained in the &s;y&s;tem before the gums became affected: and therefore, if any advantage was to be ex|pected from mercury in this di&s;ea&s;e, this latter method, in which larger quantities could be introduced into the &s;y&s;tem, ought naturally to be preferred.</P>
<P>The two following ca&s;es, related to me by the gentlemen them&s;elves, fir&s;t led me to believe the nece&s;&s;ity of much mercury in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="36">liver-complaint, which was relieved by mercury. As the mercury was only given him by the mouth, the gums were fre|quently affected.

Eighteen years had elap&s;ed from this time without his ever &s;uffering a day's &s;ickne&s;s.

<P>CAPTAIN L. a &s;lender young man, of about twenty-eight years of age, told me that, for the two fir&s;t years after his ar|rival in India, he laboured under a dy|&s;entery, which made his life be de&s;paired of, until he fell under the care of a &s;ur|geon who gave him mercury. This me|dicine
<PB N="35" REF="37">relieved him &s;o much that he con|tinued to take it in con&s;iderable quantities, but all by the mouth, and per&s;i&s;ted in its u&s;e as freely as the gums would permit, until the di&s;ea&s;e was removed. During ten years, which was the whole time in|tervening from this cour&s;e, he had enjoyed good health; but his teeth and gums never after recovered their natural appear|ance; and his &s;aliva &s;till continued to be too profu&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides pointing out the nece&s;&s;ity of much mercury, the la&s;t ca&s;e had deter|mined me to examine the livers of all dy&s;enteric patients in future. An oppor|tunity of confirming the good effects of &s;uch an examination &s;oon after pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the following ca&s;e:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>An officer in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, after a campaign of &s;ixteen months, during which he had &s;uffered repeated &s;ickne&s;s,
<PB N="36" REF="38">was attacked with dy&s;enteric &s;ymptoms. Having u&s;ed &s;alts, fomentations, gly&s;ters, opium, &amp;c. for eight days, without any effect, his ca&s;e was thought to be mortal.</P>
<P>I then &s;aw him; and, on examination, found the right lobe of his liver evidently di&s;ea&s;ed. He was immediately put upon a cour&s;e of mercurial frictions, which, in an hour's time, afforded him more relief than he had experienced from the fir&s;t attack. The frictions were &s;ucce&s;sfully continued; but the exhibition of a few grains of calomel, after the ninth friction, affected the mouth &s;o &s;uddenly, and &s;o violently, as to render the continuance of them impracticable. The dy&s;enteric &s;ymp|toms di&s;appeared, but his mouth remained for &s;everal days very trouble&s;ome. He was &s;ent to the Dani&s;h &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t for the ree&s;tabli&s;hment of his health. His mouth was &s;carce well, when he was as &s;everely attacked with the flux, and a pain of the left lobe of the liver.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="39">
<P>On the idea that this pain was a &s;pa&s;m of the colon, fomentations, gly&s;ters, opium, and evacuations, were again put in prac|tice. But the patient, finding all to no purpo&s;e, determined on having recour&s;e to friction, though contrary to the advice of all his medical attendants.</P>
<P>This expedient again afforded him &s;peedy relief; and he was re&s;tored to health by u&s;ing it as freely as his mouth would permit. He ever after enjoyed good health in India, and is now in Ire|land, a living witne&s;s to his ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity which the patient found of having recour&s;e to the&s;e frictions, with the great benefit he experienced from them, and the &s;udden &s;orene&s;s of the gums induced by the calomel; all the&s;e circum&s;tances furni&s;hed me with the fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the bad con&s;equences of giving the mercury by the mouth.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this gentleman's &s;e|cond recour&s;e to the frictions came to

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE IV.</HEAD>
<P>An officer in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, after the &s;iege of Cuddalore, laboured under a chronic complaint of the liver, and con|tinued in the field until he was attacked with dy&s;entery. Fourteen drachms of mercurial ointment, applied in the quan|tity of two drachms a day, removed the dy&s;entery, without affecting the gums. In about two months the dy&s;entery recurred, and was again relieved by frictions, con|tinued during another week. At the di&s;|tance of &s;ix or eight days from this period he was &s;uddenly attacked with what he thought to be only a painful crick of the left &s;ide of the neck. For this complaint recour&s;e was had to topical applications of opium and volatile liniment, hot flannels, and fotu&s;es, but without any effect; and, about two hours after, a pain, not le&s;s
<PB N="39" REF="41">violent, was felt about the left hypo|chondre, and extended over the &s;tomach. As the patient had u&s;ed &s;uch a quantity of mercury, recour&s;e was had to vene&s;ec|tion; which rendered the pul&s;e more fre|quent, and the pain more in&s;uportable. The dy&s;enteric &s;ymptoms having recurred, a &s;mall do&s;e of &s;alts was now tried, with|out any benefit. Mercury was again re|&s;olved on, and rubbed in, as before, for nine days; but neither afforded any relief, nor &s;o much as affected the gums. In compliance with the patient's anxiety, mercury was exhibited by the mouth. A few do&s;es of calomel produced ulcerations of the gums, but no &s;pongine&s;s, or re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ymptoms. The mercury was di&s;continued on account of the&s;e ulcer|ations about the gums. The pain be|coming more violent, and the quantity of mercury already u&s;ed being very great, the patient began to lo&s;e all faith in that me|dicine. Mu&s;tard-pla&s;ters to the pained part were then tried; but the irritation which they excited could not be long
<PB N="40" REF="42">endured, and they afforded no relief. Frictions with hot camphorated oil were al&s;o tried to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Being now informed of the &s;ucce&s;s at|tending the third ca&s;e, I determined, notwith&s;tanding the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the patient, to pu&s;h the mercury by the &s;kin only, until the gums &s;hould become af|fected. Half an ounce of the &s;tronge&s;t mercurial ointment was rubbed in about the back, abdomen, and thighs. Before this friction was completely fini&s;hed, the patient became &s;o much relieved, as to be able to lie at his full length, in any &s;itu|ation but on the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ide. A drachm of the ointment was continued to be rubbed in, night and morning, with evi|dent good effect; and, after the friction had been repeated twelve times, the gums became uniformly &s;pongy. From that time the pain cea&s;ed, the pul&s;e became &s;ofter and &s;lower, and the patient &s;peedily returned to a better &s;tate of health than he had ever before enjoyed in India. He
<PB N="41" REF="43">remained more than a year after in the dif|ferent parts of that country, without &s;uf|fering any kind of relap&s;e. His gums remained not very long &s;pongy, nor did his &s;aliva continue to flow &s;o profu&s;ely as in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the mercury had been taken by the mouth. He is now in Eu|rope, and &s;uffers no inconvenience from change of climate</P>
<P>This, and the preceding ca&s;e, impre&s;&s;ed me with an opinion that there was an ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to avoid exhibiting mer|cury by the mouth when the patient was put under a cour&s;e of frictions.</P>
<P>In order to try whether this opinion was well-founded, I procured a large quantity of good mercurial ointment, and proceeded to the cure of a variety of ca&s;es with the frictions, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by any other remedy. I now ob&s;erved, that, by this method, the gums were much &s;lower in being affected; but, when they were af|fected,
<PB N="42" REF="44">the di&s;ea&s;e appeared to be entirely removed.</P>
<P>Sometimes the patient was relieved two or three days before the gums were af|fected. But, more frequently, relief was not to be expected till a few hours before the gums became &s;pongy; from which time the &s;ecretions, the appetite, the pul&s;e, the &s;pirits, and the complexion, very &s;peedily became natural. I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that, where the mercury was given by the &s;tomach, the gums, after becoming &s;ore, remained hard and of a natural colour in many places. In other parts there were trouble&s;ome ulcerations, attended with a copious &s;pitting. Whereas, from mercu|rial frictions alone, ulcerations never came on &s;uddenly, but were always preceded by &s;uch a regular &s;welling and change of co|lour in the gums, as to render their pre|vention extremely ea&s;y. I continued in India nine months after I had adopted this practice. All the confirmed liver ca&s;es (amounting to an immen&s;e number)
<PB N="43" REF="45">which from that time came under my care, were, by this method, cured without &s;uppurations; nor was there any relap&s;e, &s;o far as I could learn, during my &s;ub&s;e|quent re&s;idence in the country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add the following ca&s;e to tho&s;e I have already given.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE V.</HEAD>
<P>Lieutenant C. of the Company's &s;ervice, about twenty-five years of age, had fre|quently, after his arrival, which was five years before, in India, laboured under re|peated attacks of the Hepatitis. Mercurial frictions and pills had con&s;tantly relieved him, until a few weeks before I &s;aw him: he had then gone through his u&s;ual cour&s;e with but little relief, and his mouth had become too &s;ore to per&s;i&s;t in any farther trial of it. As no medical per&s;on was near him, he had recour&s;e to repeated do&s;es of &s;alts. His mouth was relieved
<PB N="44" REF="46">by the &s;alts, but his di&s;ea&s;e continued. He came under my care about a week after, and was immediately put upon the frictions, with one drachm of mercurial, ointment night and morning. Near three ounces of ointment were u&s;ed in this man|ner before the gums were affected; they then began to &s;well and a&s;&s;ume a deep red colour. From this time he enjoyed a total ce&s;&s;ation of pain, and recovered a better &s;tate of health than he had ever before ex|perienced in that country.</P>
<P>After the&s;e ca&s;es had happened our re|giment was carried round to Bengal in the Van&s;ittart Engli&s;h Indiaman. This &s;hip had ju&s;t returned from Batavia; and many of her crew were then labouring under chronic dy&s;enteries contracted in that &s;ettlement. I was a&s;ked, by the &s;ur|geon of the &s;hip, to &s;ee one of the wor&s;t ca&s;es.</P>
<P>From what I had then learned of the di&s;ea&s;es of the country, I pronounced the
<PB N="45" REF="47">ca&s;e to be a Hepatitis. The &s;urgeon could hardly be per&s;uaded of this, as the man had never complained of pain of the &s;houlder or &s;ide, nor been &s;eized either with vomitings or hiccups. But in two days a large tumor in the region of the right lobe of the liver confirmed my a&s;|&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The tumor was opened, and about three Engli&s;h pints of matter in&s;tantly di&s;charged from the liver. The man died a few days after the operation. The re&s;t of the &s;ick crew were recovered by treat|ing their ca&s;es as di&s;ea&s;ed livers.</P>
<P>After relating &s;o many in&s;tances of the good effefts of mercury, it may be expected that I &s;hould offer &s;ome opinion with re|&s;pect to its mode of operation. On this &s;ubject I &s;hall be extremely brief.</P>
<P>As there are no &s;timuli, that I know of, which can &s;upport, for &s;o great a length of time, an increa&s;ed action of the
<PB N="46" REF="48">va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, I pre&s;ume this mu&s;t be the rea&s;on why mercury has the advantage over all other medicines of that cla&s;s, and may truly be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s very peculiar powers.</P>
<P>But mercury, given by the &s;tomach, never can be made to keep up that con|tinued action, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the cure of this, and perhaps of every other di&s;ea&s;e, which has been &s;low in its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;aid of this mo&s;t excellent, though in the end debili|tating medicine, I am of opinion that it &s;hould never be u&s;ed too &s;oon; and that, when adopted, it ought to be per&s;i&s;ted in regularly. The u&s;e of &s;mall do&s;es of ca|lomel, as a prophilactic, I am convinced has often been the means of producing this di&s;ea&s;e. I would, therefore, advi&s;e no per&s;on to have recour&s;e to mercury as a preventive, nor ever to begin with it in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e; as, during that period, a change of &s;ituation and diet
<PB N="47" REF="49">may prove &s;ufficient to effect the cure. But, in the &s;econd &s;tage, the frictions ap|pear to be not only the mo&s;t expedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ious, as well as the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, method of treatment.</P>
<P>It may be proper to ob&s;erve that, dur|ing the mercurial cour&s;e, acids &s;hould be avoided; and animal food generally proves the be&s;t kind of diet. Not le&s;s than a drachm of the &s;tronge&s;t ointment &s;hould be thoroughly rubbed in, either upon the &s;ide, or &s;ome other exten&s;ive &s;urface, every night and morning.</P>
<P>The mercurial frictions, having relieved or entirely removed the pain, ought not to be di&s;continued until the gums become affected; otherwi&s;e the patient is ex|po&s;ed to a relap&s;e, with a greater tendency to &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>Sometimes, towards the conclu&s;ion of the mercurial cour&s;e, viz. about the time the gums become affected, a kind of eri|&s;ipilatous eruption breaks out all over the
<PB N="48" REF="50">body: but, by a di&s;continuance of the mercury, this may be &s;oon removed. In other ca&s;es it was ob&s;erved that the &s;tools fir&s;t becoming copious after the cour&s;e, were &s;ometimes mixed with a great quan|tity of gelatinous matter, which had &s;ome|thing the appearance of hydatids. As this &s;ymptom &s;eldom appeared till health was returning, no variation of treatment be|came nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Slight pains of the mu&s;cles of the arms, thighs, &s;houlders, and &s;ide, remain for &s;ome time after the u&s;e of mercury; but none of them are attended with any catch|ing in re&s;piration, as in the Hepatitis, and de&s;erve no particular attention. For &s;ome time after the mercurial cour&s;e, however, the great increa&s;e of per&s;piration, e&s;pecially about the abdomen, renders it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep that part well covered; otherwi&s;e the hot winds, which blow with &s;o much force in that country, are apt to produce violent &s;pa&s;modic pains of the bowels.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="51">
<P>The appetite becomes exceedingly keen after the mercurial cour&s;e, and renders the greate&s;t precautions nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;to|mach be not overcharged. The dinner &s;hould be made of one good di&s;h of roa&s;t meat, or cury, without grea&s;e, with but a very moderate u&s;e of vegetables or fruit. Two or three gla&s;&s;es of wine after dinner are as much as ought to be indulged in for &s;ome time. Drinking of grog, or any &s;pirituous liquors, &s;hould not be u&s;e; and all warm weak drinks ought likewi&s;e to be avoided. As the few gla&s;&s;es of wine after dinner are pre&s;cribed with the view of promoting dige&s;tion, no other liquid ought to be taken for at lea&s;t an hour after, that the power of the wine may not be weakened.</P>
<P>The mercurial cour&s;e, not unfrequently, produces &s;o great a &s;ecretion of bile as to render the u&s;e of vegetables and acids almo&s;t, if not totally, impracticable. This effect &s;ometimes ari&s;es to what is called in India a mercurial flux; and may be then
<PB N="50" REF="52">removed, by ab&s;taining from all acids and vegetables and adhering a few days entirely to a diet of animal food, with the u&s;e of &s;pirits and water, or Madeira wine. A &s;imilar flux happens on fir&s;t arriving in warm climates, which yields to the &s;ame method of cure, being only a preternatural increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile, occa&s;ioned by the abu&s;e of acids, fruits, or vegetables. After the Hepatitis is removed, the con|&s;tant, but cautious, u&s;e of acids, in hot climates, proves the be&s;t means of prevent|ing a relap&s;e.</P>

<P>SPASMS were the fir&s;t di&s;ea&s;es which appeared among&s;t the troops who arrived at Madras in October 1782, under the command of Major General Sir John Bur|goyne. More than fifty of the&s;e fre&s;h men were killed by them within the fir&s;t three days after they were landed in that country, and in le&s;s than a month from that time, upwards of a thou&s;and had &s;uf|fered from attacks of the&s;e complaints.</P>
<P>The te&s;tanus or &s;pa&s;m is di&s;tingui&s;hed by medical writers into various &s;pecies,
<PB N="52" REF="54">according either to the particular parts affected with contraction, or the duration of the di&s;ea&s;e. But as all the&s;e different appearances (at lea&s;t when not ari&s;ing from wounds) &s;eem to proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;es, to yield to the &s;ame method of cure, and to afford nothing particular with re&s;pe&s;t to the progno&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hall, without &s;pecifying their di&s;tinc|tions, de&s;cribe the various phaenomena, as generally ob&s;erved in India.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, previou&s;ly acknow|ledge, that though I have &s;een man wounds in India, I never &s;aw a wounded per&s;on affected with &s;pa&s;ms, except in the agonies of death; and therefore I can by no means affirm that the following ob&s;er|vations are equally applicable to tho&s;e te|tanic affections, which are de&s;cribed by authors as ari&s;ing from wounds; becau&s;e &s;uch ca&s;es, from their peculiar exciting cau&s;es, mu&s;t be &s;till more untraceable and hazardous.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="55">
<P>The &s;ymptoms which commonly fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves were coldne&s;s of the &s;urface of the body, e&s;pecially of the hands; feeblene&s;s of the pul&s;e, and &s;pa&s;|modic contractions of the lower extre|meties, &s;oon extending to the mu&s;cles of the abdomen, diaphragm, and ribs. As the &s;pa&s;ms advanced, the mu&s;cles might be &s;een to a&s;&s;ume the rigidity of cartilages; &s;ometimes cau&s;ing the body to remain im|moveably extended; &s;ometimes bending the trunk through its whole length, an|teriorly; and &s;ometimes, though &s;eldomer, backwards. The parts in which the &s;pa&s;ms began generally remained rigid; but tho&s;e which were &s;ub&s;equently &s;eized with them, had momentary intermi&s;&s;ions of the contractions; the only intervals of relief experienced by the patient from the mo&s;t tormenting pains. The hands and feet then generally became &s;odden, with cold &s;weats; the nails livid, the pul&s;e more feeble and frequent, and the breath
<PB N="54" REF="56">&s;o conden&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s to be both &s;een and felt, i&s;&s;uing in a cold &s;tream at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The thir&s;t was in&s;atiable; the tongue whiti&s;h, but never dry; vomitings became almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant; the &s;pa&s;ms, cold &s;weats, and thir&s;t, increa&s;ed with the vo|mitings; which la&s;t, if not checked, &s;oon terminated the exi&s;tence of the patient.</P>
<P>In this manner, mo&s;t commonly, was the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of phaenomena; but often they were &s;o rapid in their attack, that they &s;eemed to &s;eize the patient all in conjunction in&s;tantaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>In &s;ome few, the extremities remained warm; in others al&s;o the &s;pa&s;ms were only clonic or convul&s;ive. Some died in the fir&s;t hour of the attack; others lived a day or two with remi&s;&s;ions; when they died either of univer&s;al &s;pa&s;ms, or an apoplexy. On the di&s;&s;ection of the bodies after death, it appeared that no injury
<PB N="55" REF="57">had been &s;u&s;tained by the brain, liver, gall, bladder, &s;tomach, or heart.</P>
<P>All who recovered of this di&s;ea&s;e were ob&s;erved to have very languid &s;ecretions for a con&s;iderable time after, and frequently carbuncles, which would &s;ometimes yield neither to bark, opium, nor wine.</P>
<P>At a general meeting of the faculty at Madras, this di&s;ea&s;e was unanimou&s;ly judged to proceed from the four follow|ing cau&s;es, viz.</P>
<LG>
<L>Damps from the earth,</L>
<L>The not u&s;ing of cap&s;icum,</L>
<L>Bad arrack,</L>
<L>A coffee made of &s;tramonium.</L>
</LG>
<P>The facts adduced in &s;upport of the fir&s;t of the&s;e were, that fowls put into coops at night, in that &s;ea&s;on of the year, and on the &s;ame &s;oil that the men &s;lept, were always found dead the next morning, if the coop was not placed at a certain
<PB N="56" REF="58">height above the &s;urface of the earth. And as a &s;ufficient number of cotts had nor been previou&s;ly procured for all the troops, many of them were obliged to &s;leep on the ground.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CAPSICUM.</HEAD>
<P>As the men had not then learned to eat cap&s;icum with their meat, according to the general practice of A&s;ia, this circum|&s;tance was con&s;idered as a predi&s;ponent cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A bad kind of arrack, made from &s;ome of the mo&s;t intoxicating vegetables, is often privately &s;old among&s;t the &s;oldiery, and was therefore con&s;idered as one probable cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of the coffee made of &s;tramo|nium, which the natives both &s;ell and drink them&s;elves, as the cheape&s;t of all modes of intoxication, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved
<PB N="57" REF="59">that there were no proofs of any of the men having drank of this coffee.</P>
<P>Towards a&s;certaining the mo&s;t general exciting cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hall men|tion the following facts.</P>
<P>Drunkenne&s;s was very &s;everely puni&s;hed in all the newly arrived regiments; and to prevent detection the men, after the rolls were called in the evening, u&s;ed to drink &s;even or eight large drams, and go to bed; immediately on awakening, their thir&s;t was u&s;ually &s;o great, that they drank three or four pints of cold water, which &s;eldom failed to produce the di&s;ea&s;e. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance which led me to &s;u&s;pect this, and which was afterwards confirmed by the confe&s;&s;ions of &s;everal of the men who recovered, was my ob&s;erving that all the patients in the wor&s;t ca&s;es were brought into the ho&s;pital about four o'clock in the morning. They were attacked with the vomitings, and other &s;ymptoms,
<PB N="58" REF="60">almo&s;t immediately after they had drank the cold water.</P>
<P>A mu&s;&s;ulman, in the &s;outhern parts of the Tanjore country, having u&s;ed the cold bath immediately after coition, was &s;iezed with an univer&s;al &s;pa&s;m, and died in le&s;s than half an hour.</P>
<P>An officer, after being twelve months in India, became my patient, for a large venereal ulcer, which laid bare a con&s;ider|able portion of the urethra. After the ulcer was perfectly healed, and his mercu|rial cour&s;e fini&s;hed, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf in his &s;leep to a &s;tream of air. On waking the next morning he found his jaw &s;tiff, but as the day became hot the &s;tiffne&s;s went off. On mentioning it to me, he was de&s;ired to &s;leep warmer for the future, on the pre&s;umption that it was occa&s;ioned by an increa&s;e of per&s;piration, and irrita|bility from the u&s;e of mercury. He felt no returns of his complaint until near a
<PB N="59" REF="61">fortnight after, when he was induced by the clo&s;ene&s;s and heat, during the fir&s;t part of the night, again to &s;et open the doors and windows. The winds blowing very &s;trong towards the morning awaked him, when he found him&s;elf affected with the mo&s;t dreadful &s;pa&s;ms in every part of his body, attended with cold &s;weats, blind|ne&s;s, and &s;tiffne&s;s of his extremeties; all which &s;ymptoms could not be removed for the &s;pace of &s;ixteen hours.</P>
<P>This, and the ca&s;e of an officer of the Company's &s;ervice, who, immediately after the fatigue of a very hot day's march, plunged him&s;elf into a tank of cold water, are the only two ca&s;es of &s;pa&s;ms I ever &s;aw among&s;t officers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By officers, however, this di&s;ea&s;e is often con|founded with the <HI>coup de &s;oliel,</HI> or &s;un &s;troke, becau&s;e each, if not attended to, very &s;peedily puts a period to life. In the fir&s;t or milde&s;t attacks of the &s;un &s;troke, it exhibits the phaenomena of a &s;ynocha; in the &s;econd, tho&s;e of phrenitis; and in the la&s;t &s;tage, &s;omnolency, cold &s;weats, and death &s;ometimes, pre|ceded by a few convul&s;ive motions.</NOTE>; though above three
<PB N="60" REF="62">hundred of the 101&s;t private &s;oldiers were attacked with them on the fir&s;t month of their arrival at Madras<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Officers, however, as well as private men, have been &s;uddenly killed in that country by &s;pa&s;ms, occa|&s;ioned by expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the winds, with nothing on but their &s;hirts, when wet with per&s;piration. This will be very ea&s;ily conceived by tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with the common method of cooling liquor in India, by keeping the &s;ides of the bottles moi&s;t with wet cloths, and expo&s;ed to the evaporating in|fluence of the winds.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances I am in|duced to agree with tho&s;e authors who have con&s;idered cold<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By this expre&s;&s;ion I mean relative, not ab&s;olute cold. I &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uld not have thought this explanation nece&s;|&s;ary, as po&s;itive cold is now &s;carcely by any admitted in this country, had I not been informed that an in|genious gentleman recommends an ice-hou&s;e for the cure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">is di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e it is an endemic of the torrid climates. A gentleman who arrived in India with a &s;imilar &s;peculative opinion, enjoined the u&s;e of the cold bath in a number of tetanic ca&s;es; and had the mortification to find that, in all, he accele|rated the death of the patients &s;o quickly, that &s;carce any of them could &s;urvive two minutes alter coming out of the bath. The irritability of the body is very &s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed on the fir&s;t expo&s;ure to the influ|ence of a hot climate. Until that increa&s;ed irri|tability be considerably dimini&s;hed, a per&s;on is un&s;ea|&s;oned, and remains too weak to bear with &s;afety the meridian heat, or evening dew; neither can he &s;afely take medicines in equal do&s;es with tho&s;e who are &s;ea&s;oned to a hot climate.</NOTE> as the mo&s;t gene|ral exciting cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="63">
<P>The progno&s;is of this di&s;ea&s;e is formed with greater certainty from the warmth or coldne&s;s of the extremeties, than from either the univer&s;ality of the &s;pa&s;ms, or the frequency or &s;teadine&s;s of the pul&s;e. Thus if the &s;pa&s;ms were ever &s;o general, with warmth of the extremeties, there was no immediate danger: on the contrary, if the &s;pa&s;m was ever &s;o trifling, with cold|ne&s;s, there was every danger to be feared.</P>
<P>The warm bath, and wrapping up in blankets, with the u&s;e of opium, were what I at fir&s;t chiefly depended upon in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e. But what the faculty
<PB N="62" REF="64">there relied on mo&s;t, was the liberal u&s;e of hot Madeira wine.</P>
<P>If one bottle &s;hould be thrown up, as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t as it was drank, they recommended a &s;econd and third bottle. But this practice is not very &s;ucce&s;sful: for; in the wor&s;t ca&s;es, the reachings are the mo&s;t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms; as the cold &s;weats and &s;pa&s;ms are con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to in|crea&s;e with them. And though the thir&s;t be always in&s;atiable, yet to allow no more than half an ounce of &s;ome warm liquid at a time, and that of the mo&s;t cordial kind, with thirty or forty drops of laudanum, proved a more &s;ucce&s;sful plan than indulging the patient in a full draught. This cordial and laudanum I u&s;ed to repeat as fa&s;t as it was thrown up. But when the patient retained a do&s;e, I repeated the cordial, without the opium, but in the &s;ame &s;mall quantities, and at intervals. For a draught of any liquid was &s;ure to make the vomitings recur, and with them the cold &s;weats, thir&s;t, and &s;pa&s;ms.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="65">
<P>Afterwards, being in a &s;ituation where the warm bath could not be had recour&s;e to, and being then &s;atisfied by my own ob&s;ervations, by the te&s;timony of many of the faculty at Madras, and by the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt practice of the natives, that warmth was the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful method of combating this di&s;ea&s;e, I relied upon repeated injections of warm broth, with about thirty drops of laudanum, at the &s;ame time advi&s;ing the &s;e of general fric|tions, with hot dry flannels, and the warm cordial draughts, with laudanum repeat|edly, until the reachings had cea&s;ed: and by the&s;e means I thought I &s;ucceeded better than ever I had done with the warm bath.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e ca&s;es which were relieved by the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rm bath oftener relap&s;ed, than tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">lieved by the injections.</P>
<P>The practice of the natives in this di|&s;ea&s;e is to u&s;e frictions, and hot dry &s;and,
<PB N="64" REF="66">or heat of any &s;ort; giving likewi&s;e drams, or hot pepper water, to tho&s;e who&s;e ca&s;ts will not admit of the drinking of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>A Dutch phy&s;ician in that country is &s;aid to have been always very &s;ucce&s;sful in this di&s;ea&s;e, by treating it in the following manner: to &s;trip the patient, lay him on a cane couch, under which were placed &s;toves of fire; to cover the trunk and limbs from the air with a blanket, &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed that the heat from the &s;toves &s;hould be confined about the body; to have fric|tions at the &s;ame time u&s;ed under the blankets, with warm flannel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A to giving opium in a &s;olid form, either in this di&s;ea&s;e or cholera mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bus, any one mu&s;t &s;ee the im|propriety of it, who con&s;iders how unfit the &s;tomach in &s;uch ca&s;es is to perform any part of its natural functions.</NOTE>, and to exhibit a do&s;e of opium in &s;olution after every vomiting.</P>
<P>As I never had any ca&s;es of &s;pa&s;ms after learning this method, I never had an op|portunity of giving it a trial.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="67">
<P>With regard to the accounts related by &s;ome authors of the &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;e of mer|curial frictions, rubifacients, or of bli&s;ters, in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, I have only to ob&s;erve, that however univer&s;al the &s;pa&s;ms were in all the ca&s;es I have &s;een, I never &s;aw that ca&s;e prove mortal where there was &s;ufficient warmth upon the &s;urface for the &s;kin to ab&s;orb mercury, or to be made red by bli&s;ters or other &s;timulating applications.</P>
