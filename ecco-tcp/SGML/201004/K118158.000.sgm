<P>THE COMPENDIOUS MEASURER; BEING A BRIEF, YET COMPREHENSIVE, TREATISE ON MENSURATION AND PRACTICAL GEOMETRY.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME years &s;ince I publi&s;hed a complete Treati&s;e on Men&s;uration, both in Theory and Practice; in which the Elements of that Science are demon&s;trated, and the Rules applied to the various practical pur|po&s;es of life. That work has been well received by the Public, and honoured with the high approbation of the more learned Mathematicians.</P>
<P>It has, however, been often repre&s;ented to me, by Tutors and others, that the great &s;ize and price of that work, as well as the very &s;cientific manner in which it is formed, prevent it from being &s;o gene|rally u&s;eful in &s;chools, and to practical mea&s;urers, as a more compendious and familiar little book might be, which they could put into the hands of their pu|pils, as a work containing all the practical rules of that art, in a form proper for them to copy from, and unmixed with &s;uch geometrical and algebraical de|mon&s;trations as occur in the large work.</P>
<P>In compliance, therefore, with &s;uch repre&s;entations, I have drawn up this Compendium of Men&s;uration, Practical Geometry, and Arithmetic, expre&s;sly with the view of accommodating it to practical matters, and to the u&s;e of &s;chools. I have, therefore, here brought together all the mo&s;t u&s;eful rules and pre|cepts; have arranged them in an orderly manner, proper for the pupil to copy; and delivered them in plain and familiar language. An example, worked out at full length, is &s;et down to each rule, together with drawings or repre&s;entations of the geometrical figures proper to illu&s;trate each problem; and then are &s;ubjoined &s;ome more que&s;tions to each rule, as examples propo&s;ed for the practice of the learner, with
<PB N="iv" REF="3">the an&s;wer &s;et down, by which he may know when his work is right.</P>
<P>The introduction to Decimal and Duodecimal Arithmetic, will be found u&s;eful, by going over tho&s;e branches before entering on the Men&s;uration, that the learner may be very ready and expert in numeral calculations.</P>
<P>The Practical Geometry contains a great num|ber of geometrical con&s;tructions and operations; by the practice of which the learner will acquire the free and ea&s;y u&s;e of his in&s;truments, and &s;o become prepared for making the drawings that are u&s;eful for illu&s;trating the various branches of men&s;uration fol|lowing.</P>
<P>The Men&s;uration it&s;elf next &s;ucceeds, and is di|vided into various parts; fir&s;t, Men&s;uration in gene|ral, and then as applied to the &s;everal practical u&s;es in life. The whole being arranged in &s;uch order as the learner may properly take in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; or di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into &s;everal branches, of which he may &s;elect and &s;tudy any peculiar ones that may be more to his purpo&s;e than the re&s;t, when he either has not lei&s;ure or inducement to go over the whole in a regular gra|dation. And notwith&s;tanding the compendious &s;ize of the book, and the great number of practical branches here treated, it will be found that each one is much more full and complete than the fir&s;t appear|ance of &s;o &s;mall a form may promi&s;e to admit of. However, if farther &s;atisfaction be de&s;ired by any one, either concerning the &s;cience in general, or the demon&s;trations of the rules, or the more curious and copious di&s;play of properties, he may apply to my large treati&s;e before mentioned, where he will find every part delivered in the mo&s;t ample form.</P>

<P>A Decimal is a fraction who&s;e denominator is an unit, or 1, with &s;ome number of ciphers an|nexed; as 1/10 or 45/10000.</P>
<P>Decimals are written down without their denomi|nators, the numerators being &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed as to &s;hew what the denominators are; which is done, by &s;eparating, by a point, &s;o many of the right-hand figures from the re&s;t as there are ciphers in the deno|minator; the figures on the left &s;ide of the point be|ing integers, and tho&s;e on the right decimals.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Thus, 0.5 is under&s;tood to be 5/10 or &frac12;</ITEM>
<ITEM>And 0.25 is under&s;tood to be 25/100 or &frac14;</ITEM>

<P>So that the denominator of a decimal is a 1, with as many ciphers as there are figures in the decimal.</P>
<P>A finite decimal, is that which ends at a certain number of places. But an infinite decimal, that which no where ends, but is under&s;tood to be indefinitely continued.</P>
<P>A repeating decimal, has one figure, or &s;everal figures continually repeated. As 20.2433 &amp;c. which is a &s;ingle or &s;imple repetend. And 20.2424 &amp;c. or 20.246246 &amp;c. which are compound re|petends; and are otherwi&s;e called circulates, or cir|culating decimals.

<HEAD>EVOLUTION; OR EXTRACTION OF ROOTS.</HEAD>
<P>The root of any given number, or power, is &s;uch a number, as being multiplied by it&s;elf a certain number of times, will produce the power; and it is denominated the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, fourth, &amp;c. root, re&s;pectively, as the number of multiplications made of it to produce the given power is 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. that is, the name of the root is taken from the number which exceeds the multiplications by 1, like the name of the power in involution.</P>
<P>The index of the root, like that of the power in involution, is 1 more than the number of the multi|plications nece&s;&s;ary to produce the power or given number. So 2 is the index of the &s;econd or &s;quare root; and 3 the index of the 3d or cubic root; and 4 the index of the 4th root; and &s;o on.</P>
<P>Roots are &s;ometimes denoted by writing &radic; before the power, with the index of the root again&s;t it: &s;o the third root of 50 is 3&radic;50, and the &s;econd root of it is &radic;50, the index 2 being omitted, which index is always under&s;tood when a root is named or written without one, but if the power be expre&s;&s;ed by &s;everal numbers with the &s;ign &plus; or &minus;, &amp;c. between them, then a line is drawn from the top of the &s;ign of the root or radical &s;ign, over all the parts of it; &s;o the third root of 47&minus;15 is <GAP DESC="math">. and &s;ometimes roots are de&s;igned like powers, with the reciprocal or
<PB N="30" REF="41">the index of the root above the given number. So the root of 3 is 3^&frac12;, the root of 50 is 50^&frac12;, and the third root of it is 50&frac13;, al&s;o the third root of 47&mdash;15 is <GAP DESC="math">. And this method of notation has ju&s;tly prevailed in the modern algebra; becau&s;e &s;uch roots, being con&s;idered as fractional powers, need no other directions for any operations to be made with them, than tho&s;e for integral powers.</P>
<P>A number is called a complete power of any kind, when its root of the &s;ame kind can be accu|rately extracted; but if not, the number is called an imperfect power, and its root a &s;urd or irrational quantity. So 4 is a complete power of the &s;econd kind, its root being 2; but an imperfect power of the third kind, its third root being a &s;urd quantity, which cannot be accurately extracted.</P>
<P>Evolution is the finding of the roots of numbers, either accurately, or in decimals to any propo&s;ed de|gree of accuracy.</P>
<P>The power is fir&s;t to be prepared for extraction, or evolution, by dividing it, by means of points or commas, from the place of units, to the left hand in integers, and to the right in decimal fractions, into periods, containing each as many places of figures as are denoted by the index of the root, if the power contain a complete number of &s;uch periods; that is each period to have two figures for the &s;quare root, three for the cube root, four for the fourth root, and &s;o on.

<P><HI>Note,</HI> The root will contain ju&s;t as many places of figures as there are periods or points in

<P>Ex. 1. To extract the root of 17.3056.</P>
<P>Having divided the given number into three periods, namely 17, and 30, and 56, I find that 16 is the next &s;quare to 17, the fir&s;t period, which &s;et below, and &s;ub|tracting, 1 remains, to which bring down 30, the next pe|riod, makes 130 for a divi|dend. Then 4, the root of

And when the root is to be ex|tracted to a great number of places, the work may be much abbreviated thus: having proceeded in the extraction after the common method till you have found one more than half the required number of figures in the root, the re&s;t may be found by divid|ing the la&s;t remainder by its corre&s;ponding divi&s;or, annexing a cipher to every dividual, as in divi&s;ion of decimals; or rather, without annexing ciphers, by omitting continually the right-hand figure of the divi&s;or, after the manner of the third contraction in divi&s;ion of decimals in page 10.</P>

<P N="1">1. SOLIDS, or bodies, are figures having length, breadth, and thickne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. A pri&s;m is a &s;olid, or body, who&s;e ends are any plane figures, which are equal and &s;imilar; and its &s;ides are parallelograms.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>A pri&s;m is called a triangu|lar pri&s;m, when its ends are triangles; a &s;quare pri&s;m, when its ends are &s;quares; a pentagonal pri&s;m, when its ends are pentagons; and &s;o on.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="3">3. A cube is a &s;quare pri&s;m, having &s;ix &s;ides, which are all &s;quares. It is like a die, having its &s;ides perpendicular to one another.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="4">4. A parallelopipedon is a &s;olid having &s;ix rectangular &s;ides, every oppo&s;ite pair of which are equal and parallel.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="5">5. A cylinder is a round pri&s;m, having circles for its ends.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="122" REF="132">6. A pyramid is a &s;olid having any plane figure for a ba&s;e, and its &s;ides are triangles who&s;e vertices meet in a point at the top, called the vertex of the pyramid.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The pyramid takes names accord|ing to the figure of its ba&s;e, like the pri&s;m; being triangular, or &s;quare, or hexagonal, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. A cone is a round pyramid, having a circular ba&s;e.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="8">8. A &s;phere is a &s;olid bounded by one continued convex &s;urface, every point of which is equally di&s;tant from a point within, called the center.&mdash;The &s;phere may be con|ceived to be formed by the revolu|tion of a &s;emicircle about its diame|ter, which remains fixed.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="9">9. The axis of a &s;olid, is a line drawn from the middle of one end, to the middle of the oppo&s;ite end; as between the oppo&s;ite ends of a pri&s;m. Hence the axis of a pyramid, is the line from the vertex to the middle of the ba&s;e, or the end on which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand. And the axis of a &s;phere, is the &s;ame as a diameter, or a line pa&s;&s;ing through the center, and terminated by the &s;urface on both &s;ides.</P>
<P N="10">10. When the axis is perpendicular to the ba&s;e, it is a right pri&s;m or pyramid; otherwi&s;e, it is oblique.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="123" REF="133">11. The height or altitude of a &s;olid, is a line drawn from its vertex or top, perpendicular to its ba&s;e.&mdash;This is equal to the axis in a right pri&s;m or pyramid; but in an oblique one, the height is the perpendicular &s;ide of a right-angled triangle, who&s;e hypotenu&s;e is the axis.</P>
<P N="12">12. Al&s;o a pri&s;m or pyramid is regular or irregular, as its ba&s;e is a regular or an irregular plane figure.</P>
<P N="13">13. The &s;egment of a pyramid, &s;phere, or any other &s;olid, is a part cut off the top by a plane parallel to the ba&s;e of that figure.</P>
<P N="14">14. A fru&s;tum or trunk, is the part that remains at the bottom, after the &s;egment is cut off.</P>
<P N="15">15. A zone of a &s;phere, is a part intercepted between two parallel planes; and is the difference between two &s;egments. When the ends, or planes, are equally di&s;tant from the center, on both &s;ides, the figure is called the middle zone.</P>
<P N="16">16. The &s;ector of a &s;phere, is compo&s;ed of a &s;eg|ment le&s;s than a hemi&s;phere or half &s;phere, and of a cone having the &s;ame ba&s;e with the &s;egment, and its vertex in the center of the &s;phere.</P>
<P N="17">17. A circular &s;pindle, is a &s;olid generated by the revolution of a &s;eg|ment of a circle about its chord, which remains fixed.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="18">18. A regular body, is a &s;olid contained under a cer|tain number of equal and regular plane figures of the &s;ame &s;ort.</P>
<P N="19">19. The faces of the &s;olid are the plane figures un|der which it is contained. And the linear &s;ides, or edges of the &s;olid, are the &s;ides of the plane faces.</P>
<P N="20">20. There are only five regular bodies: namely, 1&s;t, the tetraedron, which is a regular pyramid, having four triangular faces; 2d, the hexaedron, or cube,
<PB N="124" REF="134">which has 6 equal &s;quare faces; 3d, the octaedron, which has 8 triangular faces; 4th, the dodecaedron, which has 12 pentagonal faces; 5th, the ico&s;aedron, which has 20 triangular faces.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> If the following figures be exactly drawn on pa&s;teboard, and the lines cut half through, &s;o that the parts be turned up and glued together, they will repre&s;ent the five regular bodies: namely, figure 1 the tetraedron, figure 2 the hexaedron, figure 3 the octae|dron, figure 4 the dodecaedron, and figure 5 the ico&s;aedron.</P>

<P>Before you u&s;e this in&s;trument, take a &s;heet of paper which will cover it, and wet it to make it expand; then &s;pread it flat upon the table, pre&s;&s;ing down the frame upon the edges, to &s;tretch it and keep it fixed there; and when the paper is become dry, it will, by con|tracting again, &s;tretch it&s;elf &s;mooth and flat from any cramps or unevenne&s;s.

<P>And in the&s;e operations ob&s;erve the following parti|cular cautions and directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the lines upon which you make &s;tarions be directed towards objects as far di&s;tant as po&s;&s;ible; and when you have &s;et any &s;uch object, go round the table and look through the &s;ights from the other end of the index, to &s;ee if any other remarkable object lie directly oppo&s;ite; if there be not &s;uch an one, endeavour to find another forward object, &s;uch as &s;hall have a remark|able backward oppo&s;ite one, and make u&s;e of it rather than the other; becau&s;e the back object will be of u&s;e in fixing the table in the original po&s;ition either when you have mea&s;ured too near to the forward object, or when it may be hid from your &s;ight at any nece&s;&s;ary &s;tation by intervening hedges, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the &s;aid lines, upon which the &s;tations are taken, be pur&s;ued as far as you conveniently can; for that will be the means of pre&s;erving more accuracy in the work.</P>
<P N="3">3. At each &s;tation it will be nece&s;&s;ary to prove the truth of it; that is, whether the table be &s;traight in the line towards the object, and al&s;o whether the di&s;|tance be rightly mea&s;ured and laid down on the paper.&mdash; To know if the table be &s;et down &s;traight in the line; lay the index upon the table in any manner, and more the table about till through the &s;ights you perceive either the fore or back object; then, without moving the table, go round it and look through the &s;ights by

<P>When one paper is full, and you have occa&s;ion for more; draw a line in any manner through the farthe&s;t point of the la&s;t &s;tation line, to which the work can be conveniently laid down; then take the &s;heet off the table, and fix another on, drawing a line upon it, in a part the mo&s;t convenient for the re&s;t of the work; then &s;old or cut the old &s;heet by the line drawn on it, apply the edge to the line on the new &s;heet, and, as they lie in that po&s;ition, continue the la&s;t &s;tation line upon the new paper, placing upon it the re&s;t of the mea&s;ure, be|ginning
<PB N="190" REF="202">at where the old &s;heet left off. And &s;o on from &s;heet to &s;heet.</P>
<P>When the work is done, and you would fa&s;ten all the &s;heets together into one piece, or rough plan, the afore|&s;aid lines are to be accurately joined together, as when the lines were transferred from the old &s;heets to the new ones.</P>
<P>But it is to be noted, that if the &s;aid joining lines, upon the old and new &s;heet, have not the &s;ame inclina|tion to the &s;ide of the table, the needle will not point to the original degree when the table is rectified; and if the needle be required to re&s;pect &s;till the &s;ame degree of the compa&s;s, the ea&s;ie&s;t way of drawing the lines in the &s;ame po&s;ition, is to draw them both parallel to the &s;ame &s;ides of the table, by means of the equal divi&s;ions mark|ed on the other two &s;ides.</P>

<HEAD>3. OF THE THEODOLITE.</HEAD>
<P>The theodolite is a brazen circular ring, divided in|to 360 degrees, and having an index with &s;ights, or a tele&s;cope, placed upon the center, about which the in|dex is moveable; al&s;o a compa&s;s fixed to the center, to point out cour&s;es and check the &s;ights; the whole be|ing fixed by the center upon a &s;tand of a convenient height for u&s;e.</P>
<P>In u&s;ing this in&s;trument, an exact account, or field-book, of all mea&s;ures and things nece&s;&s;ary to be re|marked in the plan, mu&s;t be kept, from which to make out the plan upon your return home from the ground.</P>
<P>Begin at &s;uch part of the ground, and mea&s;ure in &s;uch directions, as you judge mo&s;t convenient; taking angles or directions to objects, and mea&s;uring &s;uch di&s;tances as appear nece&s;&s;ary, under the &s;ame re&s;trictions as in the u&s;e of the plain table. And it is &s;afe&s;t to &s;ix the theodolite in the original po&s;ition at every &s;tation by means of fore and back objects, and the compa&s;s, ex|actly as in u&s;ing the plain table; regi&s;tering the num|ber of degrees cut off by the index when directed to
<PB N="191" REF="203">each object; and, at any &s;tation, placing the index at the &s;ame degree as when the direction towards that &s;ta|tion was taken from the la&s;t preceding one, to fix the theodolite there in the original po&s;ition, after the &s;ame manner as the plain table is fixed in the original po&s;i|tion, by laying its index along the line of the la&s;t di|rection.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method of laying down the afore&s;aid lines of direction, is to de&s;cribe a pretty large circle, quarter it, and lay upon it the &s;everal numbers of degrees cut off by the index in each direction; then, by means of a parallel ruler, draw, from &s;tation to &s;tation, lines parallel to lines drawn from the center to the re&s;pective points in the circumference.</P>

<P>The cro&s;s is very u&s;eful to mea&s;ure &s;mall and crooked pieces of ground. The method is to mea&s;ure a ba&s;e or chief line, u&s;ually in the longe&s;t direction of the piece from corner to corner; and while mea&s;uring it, finding the places where perpendiculars would fall up|on this line from the &s;everal corners and bends in the boundary of the piece, with the cro&s;s, by fixing it, by trials, upon &s;uch parts of the line as that through one pair of the &s;ights both ends of the line may appear, and through the other pair you can perceive the corre&s;pond|ing bends or corners; and then mea&s;uring the lengths of the &s;aid perpendiculars.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides the fore-mentioned in&s;truments, which are mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed, there are &s;ome others; as the circumferentor, which re&s;embles the theodolite in &s;hape and u&s;e; and the &s;emi-circle, for taking angles, &amp;c. But of all the in&s;truments for mea&s;uring, the plain table is
<PB N="192" REF="204">certainly the be&s;t; not only becau&s;e it may be u&s;ed as a theodolite or &s;emi-circle, by turning uppermo&s;t that &s;ide of the frame which has the 360 degrees upon it; but becau&s;e it is, in its own proper u&s;e, by much the ea&s;ie&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t accurate for the purpo&s;e; for by planning every part immediately upon the &s;pot, as &s;oon as mea&s;ured, there is not only &s;aved a great deal of writing in the field-book, but every thing can al&s;o be planned more ea&s;ily and accurately while it is in view, than it can afterwards from a field-book, in which many little things mu&s;t be either neglected or mi&s;taken; and be&s;ides, the opportunities which the plain table afford of correcting your work, or proving if it be right, at every &s;tation, are &s;uch advantages as can never be balanced by any other method. But although the plain table be the mo&s;t generally u&s;eful in&s;trument, it is not <HI>always</HI> &s;o; there being many ca&s;es in which &s;ometimes one in&s;trument is the propere&s;t, and &s;ome|times another; nor is that &s;urveyor ma&s;ter of his bu|&s;ine&s;s who cannot in any ca&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h which is the fitte&s;t in&s;trument or method, and u&s;e it accordingly: nay &s;ometimes no in&s;trument at all, but barely the chain it&s;elf, is the be&s;t method, particularly in regular open fields lying together; and even when you are u&s;ing the plain table, it is often of advantage to mea&s;ure &s;uch large open parts with the chain only, and from tho&s;e mea&s;ures lay them down upon the table.</P>
<P>The perambulator is u&s;ed for mea&s;uring roads, and other great di&s;tances on level ground, and by the &s;ides of rivers. It has a wheel of 8&frac14; feet, or half a pole, in circumference, upon which the machine turns; and the di&s;tance mea&s;ured, is pointed out by an index, which is moved round by clock work.</P>
<P>Levels, with tele&s;cople or other &s;ights, are u&s;ed to find the level between place and place, or how much one place is higher or lower than another.</P>
<P>An off&s;et-&s;taff is a very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tru|ment, for mea&s;uring the off&s;ets and other &s;hort di&s;tances.
<PB N="193" REF="205">It is 10 links in length, being divided and marked at each of the 10 links.</P>
<P>Ten &s;mall arrows, or rods of iron or wood, are u&s;ed to mark the end of every chain length, in mea&s;uring lines. And &s;ometimes pickets, or &s;taves with flags, are &s;et up as marks or objects of direction.</P>
<P>Various &s;cales are al&s;o u&s;ed in protracting and mea|&s;uring on the plan or paper; &s;uch as plane &s;cales, line of chords, protractor, compa&s;&s;es, reducing &s;cale, pa|rallel and perpendicular rules, &amp;c. Of plane &s;cales, there &s;hould be &s;everal &s;izes, as a chain in 1 inch, a chain in &frac34; of an inch, a chain in &frac12; an inch, &amp;c. And of the&s;e, the be&s;t for u&s;e, are tho&s;e that are laid on the very edges of the ivory &s;cale, to prick off di&s;tances by, without compa&s;&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>THE FIELD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;urveying with the plain table, a field-book is not u&s;ed, as every thing is drawn on the table immediately when it is mea&s;ured. But in &s;urveying with the theo|dolite, or any other in&s;trument, &s;ome &s;ort of a field-book mu&s;t be u&s;ed, to write down in it a regi&s;ter or ac|count of all that is done and occurs relative to the &s;urvey in hand.</P>
<P>This book every one contrives and rules as he thinks fitte&s;t for him&s;elf. The following is a &s;pecimen of a form very generally u&s;ed. It is ruled into 3 columns: the middle, or principal column, is for the &s;tations, angles, bearings, di&s;tances mea&s;ured, &amp;c; and tho&s;e on the right and left are for the offsets on the right and left, which are &s;et again&s;t their corre&s;ponding di&s;tances in the middle column; as al&s;o for &s;uch remarks as may oc|cur, and be proper to note in drawing the plan, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here &Sun; 1 is the fir&s;t &s;tation, where the angle or bear|ing is 105&deg; 25&prime;. On the left, at 73 links in the di&s;tance or principal line, is an offset of 92; and at 610 an offset of 24 to a cro&s;s hedge. On the right, at o, or the beginning, an offset 25 to the corner of the field; at 248 Brown's boundary hedge commences; at 610
<PB N="194" REF="206">an offset 35; and at 954, the end of the fir&s;t line, the o denotes its terminating in the hedge. And &s;o on for the other &s;tations.</P>

<PB N="196" REF="208">the chain by the other end of it, till it is &s;tretched &s;traight, and laid or held level, and the leader directed, by the follower waving his hand, to the right or left, till the follower &s;ee him exactly in a line with the mark or direction to be mea&s;ured to; there both of them &s;tretch|ing the chain &s;traight, and &s;tooping and holding it le|vel, the leader having the head of one of his arrows in the &s;ame hand by which he holds the end of the chain, let him there &s;tick one of them down with it while he holds the chain &s;tretched. This done, he leaves the arrow in the ground, as a mark for the fol|lower to come to, and advances another chain forward, being directed in his po&s;ition by the follower, &s;tanding at the arrow, as before; as al&s;o by him&s;elf now, and at every &s;ucceeding chain's length, by moving him&s;elf from &s;ide to &s;ide, till he brings the follower and the back mark into a line. Having then &s;tretched the chain, and &s;tuck down an arrow, as before, the fol|lower takes up his arrow, and they advance again in the &s;ame manner another chain-length. And thus they proceed till all the 10 arrows are employed, and are in the hands of the follower; and the leader, without an arrow, is arrived at the end of the 11th chain length. The follower then &s;ends or brings the 10 arrows to the leader, who puts one of them down at the end of his chain, and advances with the chain as before. And thus the arrows are changed from the one to the other at every 10 chains length, till the whole line is fini&s;hed; when the number of changes of the arrows &s;hews the number of tens, to which the follower adds the arrows he holds in his hand, and the number of links of an other chain over to the mark or end of the line. So if there have been 3 changes of the arrows, and the fol|lower hold 6 arrows, and the end of the line cut off 45 links more, the whole length of the line is &s;et down in links thus 3645.</P>

<HEAD>PROBLEM XI. <HI>To Survey a Large E&s;tate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>If the e&s;tate be very large, and contain a great num|ber of fields, it cannot well be done by &s;urveying all the fields &s;ingly, and then putting them together; nor can it be done by taking all the angles and boundaries that inclo&s;e it. For in the&s;e ca&s;es, any &s;mall errors will be &s;o multiplied, as to render it very much di&s;|torted.</P>
<P N="1">1. Walk over the e&s;tate two or three times, in order to get a perfect idea of it, and till you can carry the map of it tolerably in your head. And to help your me|mory, draw an eye draught of it on paper, or at lea&s;t, of the principal parts of it, to guide you.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3"><PB N="211" REF="223">3. Take what angles, between the &s;tations, you think nece&s;&s;ary, and mea&s;ure the di&s;tances from &s;tation to &s;tation, always in a right line: the&s;e things mu&s;t be done, till you get as many angles and lines as are &s;uffi|cient for determining all your points of &s;tation. And in mea&s;uring any of the&s;e &s;tation di&s;tances, mark accu|rately where the&s;e lines meet with any hedges, ditches, roads, lanes, paths, rivulets, &amp;c. and where any re|markable object is placed, by mea&s;uring its di&s;tance from the &s;tation line; and where a perpendicular from it cuts that line; and always mind, in any of the&s;e ob|&s;ervations, that you be in a right line, which you will know by taking back&s;ight and fore&s;ight, along your &s;ta|tion line. And thus as you go along any main &s;tation line, take offsets to the ends of all hedges, and to any pond, hou&s;e, mill, bridge, &amp;c. omitting nothing that is remarkable. And all the&s;e things mu&s;t be noted down: for the&s;e are your data, by which the places of &s;uch objects are to be determined upon your plan. And be &s;ure to &s;et marks up at the inter&s;ections of all hedges with the &s;tation line, that you may know where to mea&s;ure from, when you come to &s;urvey the&s;e particular fields, which mu&s;t immediately be done, as &s;oon as you have mea&s;ured that &s;tation line, whil&s;t they are fre&s;h in memory. By this means all your &s;tation lines are to be mea&s;ured, and the &s;ituation of all places adjoining to them determined, which is the fir&s;t grand point to be ob|tained. It will be proper for you to lay down your work upon paper every night, when you go home, that you may &s;ee how you go on.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the inner parts of the e&s;tate, they mu&s;t be de|termined in like manner, by new &s;tation lines: for, after the main &s;tations are determined, and every thing ad|joining to them, then the e&s;tate mu&s;t be &s;ubdivided into two or three parts by new &s;tation lines; taking inner &s;tations at proper places, where you can have the be&s;t view. Mea&s;ure the&s;e &s;tation lines as you did the fir&s;t, and all their inter&s;ections with hedges, and all offsets to &s;uch objects as appear. Then you may proceed to
<PB N="212" REF="224">&s;urvey the adjoining fields, by taking the angles that the &s;ides make with the &s;tation line, at the inter&s;ections, and mea&s;uring the di&s;tances to each corner, from the in|ter&s;ections. For every &s;tation line will be a ba&s;is to all the future operations; the &s;ituation of all parts being entirely dependent upon them; and therefore they &s;hould be taken as long as po&s;&s;ible; and it is be&s;t for them to run along &s;ome of the hedges or boundaries of one or more fields, or to pa&s;s through &s;ome of their angles. All things being determined for the&s;e &s;tations, you mu&s;t take more inner &s;tations, and continue to di|vide and &s;ubdivide till at la&s;t you come to &s;ingle fields; repeating the &s;ame work for the inner &s;tations, as for the outer ones, till all be done; and clo&s;e the work as often as you can, and in as few lines as po&s;&s;ible. And that you may choo&s;e &s;tations the mo&s;t conveniently, &s;o as to cau&s;e the lea&s;t labour, let the &s;tation lines run as far as you can along &s;ome hedges, and through as many corners of the fields, and other remarkable points, as you can. And take notice how one field lies by ano|ther; that you may not mi&s;place them in the draught.</P>
<P N="5">5. An e&s;tate may be &s;o &s;ituated, that the whole can|not be &s;urveyed together; becau&s;e one part of the e&s;tate cannot be &s;een from another. In this ca&s;e, you may di|vide it into three or four parts, and &s;urvey the parts &s;e|parately, as if they were lands belonging to different per&s;ons; and at la&s;t join them together.</P>
<P N="6">6. As it is nece&s;&s;ary to protract or lay down your work as you proceed in it, you mu&s;t have a &s;cale of a due length to do it by. To get &s;uch a &s;cale, you mu&s;t mea&s;ure the whole length of the e&s;tate in chains; then you mu&s;t con&s;ider how many inches long the map is to be; and from the&s;e you will know how many chains you mu&s;t have in an inch; then make your &s;cale, or choo&s;e one already made, accordingly.</P>
<P N="7">7. The trees in every hedge row mu&s;t be placed in their proper &s;ituation, which is &s;oon done by the plain table; but may be done by the eye without an in&s;tru|ment; and being thus taken by gue&s;s, in a rough

But all this need not be done till the draught is fini&s;hed. And ob&s;erve in all the hedges, what &s;ide the gutter or ditch is on, and to whom the fences belong.</P>
<P N="8">8. When you have long &s;tations, you ought to have a good in&s;trument to take angles with, and the plain table may very properly be made u&s;e of, to take the &s;e|veral &s;mall internal parts, and &s;uch as cannot be taken from the main &s;tations: as it is a very quick and ready in&s;trument.</P>

For when the angles have been taken, at the two &s;tations, to all the&s;e places, the marks may be moved to new ones; and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to all the places you want. The&s;e marks then being &s;et up at a convenient number of places, and &s;uch as may be &s;een from both &s;tations; go to one of the&s;e &s;tations, and with an in&s;trument to take

Then go to the other &s;tation, and take all the angles between the fir&s;t &s;tation, and each of the former marks, and &s;et them down with the others, each again&s;t his fellow with the &s;ame colour. You may, if you can, al&s;o take the angles at &s;ome third &s;tation, which may &s;erve to prove the work, if the three lines inter&s;ect in that point, where any mark &s;tands. The marks mu&s;t &s;tand till the ob&s;ervations are fini&s;hed at both &s;tations; and then they mu&s;t be taken down, and &s;et up at fre&s;h places. And the &s;ame operations mu&s;t be performed, at both &s;tations, for the&s;e fre&s;h places; and the like for others. Your in&s;trument for taking angles mu&s;t be an exceeding good one, made on purpo&s;e with tele&s;copic &s;ights; and of three, four, or five feet radius. A circumferentor is reckoned a good in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. And though it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to mea|&s;ure any di&s;tance, becau&s;e any &s;tationary line being laid down from any &s;cale, all the other lines will be propor|tional to it; yet it is better to mea&s;ure &s;ome of the lines, to a&s;certain the di&s;tances of places in miles; and to know how many geometrical miles there are in any length; and from thence to make a &s;cale to mea&s;ure any di&s;tance in miles. In mea&s;uring any di&s;tance, it will not be exact-enough to go along the high roads; by rea|&s;on of their turnings and windings, and hardly ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lying in a right line between the &s;tations, which mu&s;t cau&s;e infinite reductions, and create endle&s;s trouble to make it a right line; for which rea&s;on it can never be exact. But a better way is to mea&s;ure in a right line with a chain, between &s;tation and &s;tation, over hills and dales or level fields, and all ob&s;tacles. Only in ca&s;e of water, woods, towns, rocks, banks, &amp;c. where one cannot pa&s;s; &s;uch parts of the line mu&s;t be mea&s;ured by the methods of inacce&s;&s;ible di&s;tances; and be&s;ides, allow|ing for a&s;cents and de&s;cents, when we meet with them.
<PB N="215" REF="227">And a good compa&s;s that &s;hews the bearing of the two &s;tations, will always direct you to go &s;traight, when you do not &s;ee the two &s;tations; and in your progre&s;s, if you can go &s;traight, you may take offsets to any re|markable places, likewi&s;e note the inter&s;ection of your &s;tationary line with all roads, rivers, &amp;c.</P>

<P N="5">5. After you have done with your fir&s;t and main &s;tation lines, which command the whole county; you mu&s;t then take inner &s;tations, at &s;ome places already determined; which will divide the whole into &s;everal partitions: and from the&s;e &s;tations you mu&s;t determine the places of as many of the remaining towns as you can. And if any remain in that part, you mu&s;t take more &s;tations, at &s;ome places already determined; from which you may determine the re&s;t. And thus we mu&s;t go through all the parts of the county, taking &s;tation after &s;tation, till we have determined all we want.

<P N="6">6. La&s;tly, the po&s;ition of the &s;tation line you mea|&s;ure, or the point of the compa&s;s it lies on, mu&s;t be de|termined by a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervation. Hang up a thread and plummet in the &s;un, over &s;ome part of the &s;tation line, and ob&s;erve when the &s;hadow runs along that line, and at that moment take the &s;un's altitude; then having his declination, and the latitude, the azimuth will be found by &s;pherical trigonometry.

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="problem">
<HEAD>PROBLEM I. <HI>To Lay down the Plan of any Survey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the &s;urvey was taken with a plain table, you have a rough plan of it already on the paper which cover|ed the table. But if the &s;urvey was with any other in|&s;trument, a plan of it is to be drawn from the mea&s;ures that were taken in the &s;urvey, and fir&s;t of all a rough plan upon paper.</P>
<P>To do this, you mu&s;t have a &s;et of proper in&s;truments, for laying down both lines and angles, &amp;c. as &s;cales of various &s;izes, the more of them, and the more accurate, the better; &s;cales of chords, protractors, perpendicular and parallel rulers, &amp;c. Diagonal &s;cales are be&s;t for the lines, becau&s;e they extend to three figures, or chains and links, which are hundredth parts of chains. But in u&s;ing the diagonal &s;cale, a pair of compa&s;&s;es mu&s;t be employed to take off the lengths of the principal lines very accurately. But a &s;cale with a thin edge divided, is much readier for laying down the perpendicular off|&s;ets to crooked hedges, and for marking the places of tho&s;e offsets upon the &s;tation line; which is done at only one application of the edge of the &s;cale to that line, and then pricking off all at once the di&s;tances along it. Angles are to be laid down either with a good &s;cale of chords, which is perhaps the mo&s;t accurate way; or with a large protractor, which is much readier when many angles are to be laid down at one point, as they are pricked off all at once round the edge of the pro|tractor.</P>
<P>Very particular directions for laying down all &s;orts of figures cannot be nece&s;&s;ary in this place, to any per&s;on who has learned practical geometry, and the con&s;truc|tion of figures, and the u&s;e of his in&s;truments. It may
<PB N="219" REF="231">therefore be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that all lines and angles mu&s;t be laid down on the plan in the &s;ame order in which they were mea&s;ured in the field, and in which they are written in the field-book; laying down fir&s;t the angles for the po&s;ition of lines, then the lengths of the lines, with the places of the offsets, and then the lengths of the offsets them&s;elves, all with dry or ob&s;cure lines; then a black line drawn through the extremities of all the offsets, will be the hedge or bounding line of the field, &amp;c. After the principal bounds and lines are laid down, and made to fit or clo&s;e properly, proceed next to the &s;maller objects, till you have entered every thing that ought to appear in the plan, as hou&s;es, brooks, trees, hills, gates, &s;tiles, roads, lanes, mills, bridges, wood|lands, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The north &s;ide of a map or plan is commonly placed uppermo&s;t, and a meridian &s;omewhere drawn, with the compa&s;s or flower-de-luce pointing north. Al&s;o, in a va|cant part, a &s;cale of equal parts or chains mu&s;t be drawn, and the title of the map in con&s;picuous characters, and embelli&s;hed with a compartment. All hills mu&s;t be &s;hadowed, to di&s;tingui&s;h them in the map. Colour the hedges with different colours; repre&s;ent hilly grounds by broken hills and valleys; draw &s;ingle dotted lines for foot-paths, and double ones for hor&s;e or carriage roads. Write the name of each field and remarkable place within it, and, if you choo&s;e, its content in acres, roods, and perches.</P>
<P>In a very large e&s;tate, or a county, draw vertical and horizontal lines through the map, denoting the &s;paces between them by letters, placed at the top, and bottom, and &s;ides, for readily finding any field or other object, mentioned in a table.</P>
<P>In mapping counties, and e&s;tates that have uneven grounds of hills and valleys, reduce all oblique lines, mea&s;ured up hill and down hill, to horizontal &s;traight lines, if that was not done during the &s;urvey, before they were entered in the field-book, by making a pro|per allowance to &s;horten them. For which purpo&s;e
<PB N="220" REF="232">there is commonly a &s;mall table engraven on &s;ome of the in&s;truments for &s;urveying.</P>

<P N="1">1. Compute the contents of the figures, whether triangles, or trapeziums, &amp;c. by the proper rules for the &s;everal figures laid down in mea&s;uring; multiplying the lengths by the breadths, both in links; the product is acres after you have cut off five figures on the right, for decimals; then bring the&s;e decimals to roods and perches, by multiplying fir&s;t by 4, and then by 40.

<P N="2">2. In &s;mall and &s;eparate pieces, it is u&s;ual to ca&s;t up their contents from the mea&s;ures of the lines taken in &s;urveying them, without making a correct plan of them.</P>

Thus:
<GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P N="5">5. But in larger pieces, and whole e&s;tates, con&s;i&s;ting of many fields, it is the common practice to make a rough plan of the whole, and from it compute the con|tents quite independent of the mea&s;ures of the lines and angles that were taken in &s;urveying. For then new lines are drawn in the fields in the plan, &s;o as to divide them into trapeziums and triangles, the ba&s;es and per|pendiculars of which are mea&s;ured on the plan by means of the &s;eales from which it was drawn, and &s;o multiplied together for the contents. In this way the work is very expeditiou&s;ly done, and &s;ufficiently correct; for &s;uch dimen&s;ions are taken, as afford the mo&s;t ea&s;y method of calculation; and, among a number of parts, thus taken and applied to a &s;eale, it is likely that &s;ome of the parts will be taken a &s;mall matter too little, and others too great; &s;o that they will, upon the whole, in all probability, very nearly balance one another. After all the fields, and particular parts, are thus com|puted
<PB N="224" REF="236">&s;eparately, and added all together into one &s;um, calculate the whole e&s;tate independent of the fields, by dividing it into large and arbitrary triangles and trape|ziums, and add the&s;e al&s;o together. Then if this &s;um be equal to the former, or nearly &s;o, the work is right; but if the &s;ums have any con&s;iderable difference, it is wrong, and they mu&s;t be examined, and recomputed, till they nearly agree.</P>
<P>A &s;pecimen of dividing into one triangle, or one tra|pezium, which will do for mo&s;t &s;ingle fields, may be &s;een in the examples to the la&s;t problem; and a &s;peci|men of dividing a large tract into &s;everal &s;uch trapezi|ums and triangles, in prob. VI of chapter II of Sur|veying, page 201, where a piece is &s;o divided, and its dimen&s;ions taken and &s;et down; and again at prob. VI of men&s;uration of &s;urfaces, where the contents of the &s;ame piece are computed.</P>
<P N="6">6. But the chief &s;ecret in ca&s;ting up, con&s;i&s;ts in find|ing the contents of pieces bounded by curved, or very irregular lines, or in reducing &s;uch crooked &s;ides of fields or boundaries to &s;traight lines, that &s;hall inclo&s;e the &s;ame or equal area with tho&s;e crooked &s;ides, and &s;o obtain the area of the curved figure by means of the right-lined one, which will commonly be a trapezium. Now this reducing the crooked &s;ides to &s;traight ones, is very ea&s;ily and accurately performed thus: Apply the &s;traight edge of a thin, clear piece of lanthorn-horn to the crooked line, which is to be reduced, in &s;uch a man|ner, that the &s;mall parts cut off from the crooked figure by it, may be equal to tho&s;e which are taken in: which equality of the parts included and excluded, you will pre&s;ently be able to judge of very nicely by a little practice: then with a pencil draw a line by the &s;traight edge of the horn. Do the &s;ame by the other &s;ides of the field or figure. So &s;hall you have a &s;traight &s;ided figure equal to the curved one; the content of which, being computed as before directed, will be the content of the curved figure propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Or, in&s;tead of the &s;traight edge of the horn, a hor&s;e-hair
<PB N="225" REF="237">may be applied acro&s;s the crooked &s;ides in the &s;ame manner; and the ea&s;ie&s;t way of u&s;ing the hair, is to &s;tring a &s;mall &s;lender bow with it, either of wire, or cane, or whale-bone, or &s;uch like &s;lender &s;pringy matter; for, the bow keeping it always &s;tretched, it can be ea&s;ily and neatly applied with one hand, while the other is at liberty to make two marks by the &s;ide of it, to draw the &s;traight line by.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>Thus, let it be required to find the contents of the &s;ame figure as in prob. IX of the la&s;t chapter, page 207, to a &s;cale of 4 chains to an inch.</P>

Then draw the diagonal BD, which, by applying a proper &s;cale to it, mea&s;ures 1256.

<HEAD>PROBLEM III. <HI>To Transfer a Plan to another Paper, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>After the rough plan is completed, and a fair one is wanted; this may be done, either on paper or vellum, by any of the following methods.</P>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>FIRST METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>Lay the rough plan upon the clean paper, and keep them always pre&s;&s;ed flat and clo&s;e together, by weights laid upon them. Then, with the point of a fine pin or pricker, prick through all the corners of the plan to be copied. Take them a&s;under, and connect the pricked points, on the clean paper, with lines; and it is done.
<PB N="227" REF="239">This method is only to be practi&s;ed in plans of &s;uch figures as are &s;mall and tolerably regular, or bounded by right lines.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>SECOND METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>Rub the back of the rough plan over with black lead powder; and lay the &s;aid black part upon the clean pa|per, upon which the plan is to be copied, and in the pro|per po&s;ition. Then with the blunt point of &s;ome hard &s;ub&s;tance, as bra&s;s, or &s;uch like, trace over the lines of the whole plan; pre&s;&s;ing the tracer &s;o much as that the black lead under the lines may be transferred to the clean paper: after which take off the rough plan, and trace over the leaden marks with common ink, or with indian ink, &amp;c.&mdash;Or, in&s;tead of blacking the rough plan, you may keep con&s;tantly a blacked paper to lay between the plans.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>THIRD METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>Another method of copying plans, is by means of &s;quares. This is performed by dividing both ends and &s;ides of the plan, which is to be copied, into any con|venient number of equal parts, and connecting the corre&s;ponding points of divi&s;ion with lines; which will divide the plan into a number of &s;mall &s;quares. Then divide the paper, upon which the plan is to be copied, into the &s;ame number of &s;quares, each equal to the for|mer when the plan is to be copied of the &s;ame &s;ize, but greater or le&s;s than the others, in the proportion in which the plan is to be increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, when of a different &s;ize. La&s;tly, copy into the clean &s;quares, the parts contained in the corre&s;ponding &s;quares of the old plan; and you will have the copy either of the &s;ame &s;ize, or greater or le&s;s in any proportion.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="4" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>FOURTH METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>A fourth method is by the in&s;trument called a penta|graph, which al&s;o copies the plan in any &s;ize required.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="5" TYPE="method">
<PB N="228" REF="240">
<HEAD>FIFTH METHOD.</HEAD>
<P>But the neate&s;t method of any is this. Procure a copying frame or gla&s;s, made in this manner; namely, a large &s;quare of the be&s;t window gla&s;s, &s;et in a broad frame of wood, which can be rai&s;ed up to any angle, when the lower &s;ide of it re&s;ts on a table. Set this frame up to any angle before you, facing a &s;trong light; fix the old plan and clean paper together with &s;everal pins quite around, to keep them together, the clean paper being laid uppermo&s;t, and upon the face of the plan to be copied. Lay them, with the back of the old plan, upon the gla&s;s, namely, that part which you intend to begin at to copy fir&s;t; and, by means of the light &s;hining through the papers, you will very di&s;tinctly perceive every line of the plan through the clean pa|per. In this &s;tate then trace all the lines on the paper with a pencil. Having drawn that part which covers the gla&s;s, &s;lide another part over the gla&s;s, and copy it in the &s;ame manner. And then another part. And &s;o on till the whole be copied.</P>
<P>Then, take them a&s;under, and trace all the pencil|lines over with a &s;ine pen and Indian ink, or with com|mon ink.</P>
<P>And thus you may copy the fine&s;t plan, without in|juring it in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>When the lines, &amp;c. are copied upon the clean pa|per or vellum, the next bu&s;ine&s;s is to write &s;uch names, remarks, or explanations as may be judged nece&s;&s;ary; laying down the &s;cale for taking the lengths of any parts, a flower-de-luce to point out the direction, and the proper title ornamented with a compartment; and illu&s;trating or colouring every part in &s;uch manner as &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t natural, &s;uch as &s;hading rivers or brooks with crooked lines, drawing the repre&s;entations of trees, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hes, hills, woods, hedges, hou&s;es, gates, roads, &amp;c. in their proper places; running a &s;ingle dotted line for a foot path, and a double one for a car|riage road; and either repre&s;enting the ba&s;es or the elevations of buildings, &amp;c.</P>

<P>This in&s;trument &s;erves to compute the contents of ca&s;ks, &amp;c. after the dimen&s;ions have been taken. It is a &s;quare rule, having various logarithmic lines on its four &s;ides or faces; and three &s;liding pieces, running in grooves, in three of them.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t face are three lines, namely, two mark|ed A, B, for multiplying and dividing; and the third, MD, for malt depth, becau&s;e it &s;erves to gauge malt. The middle one B is upon the &s;lider, and is a kind of double line, being marked at both the edges of the &s;lider, for applying it to both the lines A and MD. The&s;e three lines are all of the &s;ame radius, or di&s;tance from 1 to 10, each containing twice the length of the radius. A and B are placed and numbered exactly alike, each beginning at 1, which may be either 1, or 10, or 100, &amp;c. or .1, or .01, or .001, &amp;c. but whatever it is, the

<P>Upon the third face are three lines, one upon a &s;lider marked N; and two on the &s;tock, marked SS and SL,<PB N="267" REF="279">for &s;egment &s;tanding and &s;egment lying, which &s;erve for ullaging &s;tanding and lying ca&s;ks.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE GAUGING OR DIAGONAL ROD.</HEAD>
<P>The diagonal rod is a &s;quare rule, having four faces; being commonly 4 feet long, and folding together by joints. This in&s;trument is u&s;ed both for gauging or mea&s;uring ca&s;ks, and computing their contents, and that from one dimen&s;ion only, namely the diagonal of the ca&s;k, or the length from the middle of the bung-hole
<PB N="270" REF="282">to the meeting of the head of the ca&s;k with the &s;tave oppo&s;ite to the bung; and is the longe&s;t line that can be drawn within the ca&s;k from the middle of the bung. And, accordingly, on one face of the rule is a &s;cale of inches, for mea&s;uring this diagonal; to which are placed the areas, in ale gallons, of circles to the cor|re&s;ponding diameters, in like manner as the lines on the under &s;ides of the three &s;lides in the &s;liding rule.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite face are two &s;cales of ale and wine gallons, expre&s;&s;ing the contents of ca&s;ks having the cor|re&s;ponding diagonals. And the&s;e are the lines which chiefly form the difference between this in&s;trument and the &s;liding rule; for all their other lines are the &s;ame, and to be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>The rod being applied within the ca&s;k at the bung-hole, the diagonal was found to be 34.4 inches; re|quired the content in gallons.</P>
<P>Now to 34.4 inches corre&s;pond, on the rod, 90&frac14; ale gallons or 111 wine gallons; the content required.</P>

<HEAD>THE USE OF THE TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing table, each number in the column of <HI>area &s;eg.</HI> is the area of the circular &s;egment who&s;e height, or the ver&s;ed fine of its half are, is the number immediately on the left of it, in the column of <HI>heights;</HI> the diameter of the circle being 1, and its whole area .785398.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of this table is to find, by it, the area of the &s;egment of any other circle, whatever be the diameter. And this is done by fir&s;t dividing the height of any pro|po&s;ed &s;egment by its own diameter, and the quotient is a decimal to be &s;ought in the column of heights, and again&s;t it is the tabular area to be taken out, which is &s;imilar to the propo&s;ed &s;egment. Then this tabular area being multiplied by the &s;quare of the given diameter, will be the area of your &s;egment required; becau&s;e &s;imilar areas are to each other as the &s;quares of their diameters.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<P>So if it be required to find the area of a &s;egment of a circle, who&s;e height is 3&frac14;, the diameter being 50.</P>
<P>Here 50) 3.25 (.065 quot. or tab. height, and the tab. &s;eg. is .021659 which multiply by 2500 the &s;quare of the diam. gives 54.147500 the area required.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="335">But, in dividing the given height by the diameter, if the quotient do not terminate in three places of deci|mals without a fractional remainder, then the area for that fractional part ought to be proportioned for, thus: Having found the tabular area an&s;wering to the fir&s;t three decimals of the quotient, take the difference be|tween it and the next following tabular area, which difference multiply by the fractional remaining part of the quotient, and the product will be the corre&s;ponding proportional part, to be added to the fir&s;t tabular area.</P>
<P>So if the height of a propo&s;ed &s;egment were 3&frac13;, to the diameter 50.</P>
