<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A LONDON tran&s;lation of an original work in French, by the Abbe Raynal, which treats of the Revolution of North-America, having been re|printed in Philadelphia and other parts of the continent, and as the di&s;tance at which the Abbe is placed from the American theatre of war and poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ics, has occa&s;ioned him to mi&s;take &s;everal facts, or, mi&s;conceive the cau&s;es or prin|ciples by which they were produced; the following tract, therefore, is publi&s;hed with a view to rectify them, and prevent even accidental errors intermixing with hi&s;tory, under the &s;anction of time and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>THE editor of the London eidtion has entitled it, "<HI>The Revolution of America,</HI> by the ABBE RAYNAL," and the American printers have followed the example. But I have under&s;tood, and I believe my information ju&s;t, that the piece, which is more properly r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions on the revolution, was unfairly purloined from the printer which the Abbe employed, or from the manu&s;cript copy, and is only part of a large work then in the pre&s;s, or preparing for it. The per&s;on who procured it appears to have been an Engli&s;hman, and though in an adver|ti&s;ement prefixt to the London edition, he has endea|voured to glo&s;s over the embezzlement with profe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="iv" REF="3">of patriotion, and to &s;often it with high encomiums on the author yet the action, in any view, in which it can be placed, is illiberal and unpardonable.</P>
<P>"In the cour&s;e of his travels," &s;ays he, <Q>the tran&s;|lator happily &s;ucceeded in obtaining a copy of this exqui&s;ite little piece, which has not yet made its appear|ance from any pre&s;s. He publi&s;hes a French edition, in favor of tho&s;e who will feel its eloquent rea&s;oning more forcibly in its native language, at the &s;ame time with the following tran&s;lation of it; in which he has been de&s;irous, perhaps in vain, that all the warmth, the grace, the &s;trength, the dignity of the original, &s;hould not be lo&s;t. And he flatters him&s;elf, that the indulgence of the illu&s;trious hi&s;torian will not be want|ing to a man, who, of his own motion, has taken the liberty to give this compo&s;ition to the public, only from a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion, that its momentous argu|ment will be u&s;eful, in a critical conjuncture, to that country which he loves with an ardor, that can be ex|ceeded only by the nobler flame, which burns in the bo&s;om of the philanthropic author, for the freedom and happine&s;s of all the countries upon earth.</Q></P>
<P>THIS plau&s;ibility of &s;etting off a di&s;honorable action, may pa&s;s for patrioti&s;m and &s;ound principles with tho&s;e who do not enter into its demerits and who&s;e intere&s;t is not injured nor their happine&s;s affected thereby. But it is more than probable, notwith&s;tanding the declarations it contains, that the copy was obtained for the &s;ake of profiting by the &s;ale of a new and popular work, and that the profe&s;&s;ions are but a garb to the fraud.</P>
<P>IT may with propriety be remarked, that in all coun|tries where literature is protected and it never can flou|ri&s;h where it is not, the works of an author are his legal property; and to treat letters in any other light than this, is to bani&s;h them from the country or &s;trangle them in the birth. The embezzlement from the Abbe Raynal, was. it is true, committed by one country upon another, and therefore &s;hows on defect in the laws of either. But
<PB N="v" REF="4">it is neverthele&s;s a breach of civil manners and literary ju&s;tice; neither can it be any apology, that becau&s;e the countries are at war, literature &s;hall be entitled depre|dation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;tates of literature in America mu&s;t one day become a &s;ubject of legi&s;lative con&s;ideration. Hitherto it hath been a di&s;intere&s;ted volunteer in the &s;ervice of the revolution, and no man though of profits: but when peace &s;hall give time and opportunity for &s;tudy, the country will deprive it|&s;elf of the honor and &s;ervice of letters and the improvement of &s;cience, unle&s;s &s;ufficient laws are made to prevent depre|dations on literary property.&mdash;It is well worth remarking, that Ru&s;&s;ia, who but a &s;ew years ago, was &s;careely known in Europe, owes a large &s;hare of her pre&s;ent greatne&s;s to the clo&s;e attention &s;he has paid, and the wi&s;e encouragement &s;he has given, to every brahch of &s;cience and learning; and we have almo&s;t the &s;ame in&s;tance in France, in the reign of Lewis the XIV.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT the fore&s;talling the Abbe's publication by London editions, both in French and English, and thereby not only defrauding him and throwing an expen&s;ive publica|tion on his hands by anticipating the &s;ale, are only the &s;maller injuries which &s;uch conduct may occa&s;ion. A man's opinions, whether written or in thought, are his own until he plea&s;es to publi&s;h them him&s;elf; and it is adding curely to inju&s;tice, to make him the author of what future reflection, or better information, might oc|ca&s;ion him to &s;uppre&s;s or amend. There are declarations and &s;entiments in the Abbe's piece, which, for my own part, I did not expect to find, and &s;uch as him&s;elf, on a revi&s;al, might have &s;een occa&s;ion to change; but the an|ticipated piracy effectually prevented him the opportuni|ty, and precipitated him into difficulties, which, had it not been for &s;uch ungenerous fraud, might not have hap|pened.</P>
<P>THIS mode of making an author appear before his time, will appear &s;till more ungenerous, when we con&s;i|der how exceedingly few men there are in any country,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">who can at once, and without the aid of reflection and revi&s;al, combine warm pa&s;&s;ions with a cool temper, and the full expan&s;ion of imagination with the natural and nece&s;&s;ary gravity of judgment, &s;o as to be rightly balan|ced within them&s;elves, and to make a reader feel, fancy, and under&s;tand ju&s;tly at the &s;ame time. To call three powers of the mind into action at once, in a manner that neither &s;hall interrupt, and that each &s;hall aid and vigorate the other, is a talent very rarely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT often happens that the weight of an argument is lo&s;t by the wit of &s;etting it off; or the judgment di&s;or|dered by an intemperate irriration of the pa&s;&s;ions: yet a certain degree of animation mu&s;t be felt by the writer, and rai&s;ed in the reader, in order to intere&s;t the atten|tion; and a &s;ufficient &s;cope given to the imagination, to enable it to create in the mind a &s;ight of the per&s;ons, characters and circum&s;tances of the &s;ubject; for without the&s;e the judgment will feel little or no excitement to office, and its determinations will be cold, &s;luggi&s;h, and imperfect. But if either or both of the two former are rai&s;ed too high, or heated too much, the judgment will be jo&s;&s;ied from its &s;eat, and the whole matter, however important in it&s;elf, will dimini&s;h into a pantomime of the mind, in which we create images that promote no other purpo&s;e than amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>THE Abbe's writings bear evident marks of that ex|ten&s;ion and rapidne&s;s of thinking and quickne&s;s of &s;en&s;a|tion, which of all others require revi&s;al, and the more particularly &s;o, when applied to the living characters of nations or individuals in a &s;tate of war. The lea&s;t mi&s;|information or mi&s;conception leads to &s;ome wrong con|clu&s;ion, and an error believed becomes the progenitor of others &mdash; And as the Abbe has &s;uffered &s;ome inconvenien|cies in France by mi&s;tating certain circum&s;tances of the war, and the characters of the parties therein, it becomes &s;ome apology for him that tho&s;e errors were precipitated into the world by the avarice of an ungenerous enemy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE <HI>ABBE RAYNAL</HI> ON THE Affairs of North-America.</HEAD>
<P>TO an author of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation as the Abbe Raynal, it might very well be|come me to apologize for the pre&s;ent under|taking; but as <HI>to be right</HI> is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of philo&s;ophy, and the fir&s;t principle of hi&s;tory, he will, I pre&s;ume, accept from me a declaration of my motives, which are tho&s;e of doing ju&s;tice, in preference to any complimental apology I might otherwi&s;e make.&mdash;The Abbe, in the cour&s;e of his work, has, in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, extolled without a rea&s;on, and wounded without a cau&s;e. He has given &s;ame where it was not de&s;erved, and withheld it where it was ju&s;tly due; and appears to be &s;o frequently in and out of temper with his &s;ubjects and parties, that few or none of them are decicively and uniformly marked.</P>
<P>IT is yet too &s;oon to write the hi&s;tory of the revolu|tion, and whoever attempts it precipitately, will una|voidably
<PB N="8" REF="7">mi&s;take characters and circum&s;tances, and in|volve him&s;elf in error and difficulty Things like men are &s;eldom under&s;tood rightly at fir&s;t &s;ight. But the Abbe is wrong even in the foundation of his work; that is, he has mi&s;conceived and mi&s;tated the cou&s;es which produced the rupture between England and her th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n colonies, and which led on, &s;tep by &s;tep, un&s;tudied and uncontrived on the part of America, to a revolution, which has engaged the attention, and affected the inte|re&s;t, of Europe.</P>
<P>To prove this, I &s;hall bring forward a pa&s;&s;age, which, though placed towards the latter part of the Abbe's work, is more intimately connected with the beginning; and in which, &s;peaking of the original cau&s;e of the di&s;pute, he declares him&s;elf in the following manner.&mdash;</P>
<P>"NONE," &s;ays he, <Q>of tho&s;e energetic cau&s;es, which have produced &s;o many revolutions upon the globe, exi&s;ted in North America. Neither religion nor laws had been outraged. The blood of martyrs or patri|ots had not there &s;treamed from &s;caffolds. Morals had not there been in&s;ulted. Manners, cu&s;toms, ha|bits, no object dear to nations, had there been the &s;port of ridicule. Arbitrary power had not there torn any inhabitant from the arms of his family and his friends, to drag him to a dreary dungeon. Public order had not been there inverted. The principles of admini&s;tration had not been changed there; and the maxims of government had there always remained the &s;ame. The whole que&s;tion was reduced to the knowing whether the mother country had, or had not a right to lay, directly or indirectly, a &s;light tax upon the colonies.</Q></P>
<P>ON this extraordinary pa&s;&s;age, it may not be improper, in general terms, to remark, that none can feel like tho&s;e who &s;uffer; and that for a man to be a competant judge of the provocative, or, as the Abbe &s;tiles them, the ener|getic cau&s;es of the revolution, he mu&s;t have re&s;ided in America.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">THE Abbe in &s;aying that the &s;everal particulars he has enumerated, did not exi&s;t in America, and neglecting to point out the particular period, in which he means they did not exi&s;t, reduces thereby his declaration to a nullity by taking away all meaning from the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THEY did not exi&s;t in 1763 and they all exi&s;ted before 1776; con&s;equently as there was a time when they did <HI>not,</HI> and another, when they <HI>did</HI> exi&s;t, the <HI>time when</HI> con|&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of the fact, and not to give it, is to withhold the only evidence, which proves the declaration right or wrong, and on which it mu&s;t &s;tand or fall. But the declaration as it now appears, unaccompanied by time has an effect in holding out to the world, that there was no real cau&s;e for the revolution, becau&s;e it denies the exi&s;tence of all tho&s;e cau&s;es, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be ju&s;tifiable and which the Abbe &s;tiles energetic.</P>
<P>I CONFESS my&s;elf exceedingly at a lo&s;s to find out the time to which the Abbe alludes; becau&s;e, in another part of the work in &s;peaking of the &s;tamp act which was pa&s;|&s;ed in 1764, he &s;tiles it, "An <HI>u&s;urpation</HI> of the Americans <HI>mo&s;t precious and &s;acred rights.</HI>" Con&s;equently he here admits the mo&s;t energetic of all cau&s;es that is, <HI>an u&s;urpa|tion of their mo&s;t precious and &s;acred rights,</HI> to have exi&s;ted in America twelve years before the declaration of inde|pendence, and ten years before the breaking out of ho&s;ti|lities &mdash; The time, therefore, in which the paragraph is true, mu&s;t be antecedent to the &s;tamp act, but as at that time there was no revolution nor any idea of one, it con|&s;equently applies without a meaning; and as it cannot, on the Abbe's own principle, be applied to any time <HI>after</HI> the &s;tamp act, it is therefore a wandering &s;olitary paragraph connected with nothing and at variance with every thing.</P>
<P>THE &s;tamp act, it is true, was repealed in two years after it was pa&s;&s;ed&punc; but it was immediately followed by one of infinitely more mi&s;chievous magnitude, I mean the declaratory act, which a&s;&s;erted the right, as it was &s;tiled, of the Briti&s;h Parliament, <HI>"to bind America in all ca&s;es what&s;oever."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">IF then the &s;tamp act was an u&s;urpation of the Ameri|cans mo&s;t precious and &s;acred rights, the declaratory act left them no right at all; and contained the full grown &s;eeds of the mo&s;t de&s;potic government ever exerci&s;ed in the world. It placed America not only in the lowe&s;t, but in the ba&s;e&s;t &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage; becau&s;e it demanded an un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in every thing, or as the act ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever:</HI> And what renders this act the more offen&s;ive is, that it appears to have been p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed as an act of mercy; truly then may it be &s;aid, that <HI>the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the original charters from the Crown of England, under the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of which, the adventurers from the old world &s;ettled in the new, were by this act di&s;placed from their foundations; becau&s;e, contrary to the nature of them which was that of a compact they were now made &s;ubject to repeal or alteration at the meer will of one party only The whole condition of America was thus put into the hands of the Parliament or the Mini&s;try without leaving to her the lea&s;t right in any ca&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THERE is no de&s;poti&s;m to which this iniquitous law did not extend; and tho' it might have been convenient in the execution of it to have con&s;ulted manners and ha|bits, the principle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot made all tyranny legal. It &s;topt nowhere It went to every thing. It took in with it the whole life of a man, or if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, an eternity of circum&s;tances It is the nature of law to re|quire obedience, but this demanded &s;ervitude; and the condition of an American under the operation of it&punc; was not that of a &s;ubject but a va&s;&s;al. Tyranny has often been e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>without</HI> law and &s;ometimes <HI>again&s;t</HI> it, but the hi&s;tory of mankind does not produce another in&s;tance, in which it has been e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>by</HI> law. It is an audaci|ous outrage upon civil government, and cannot be too much expo&s;ed, in order to be &s;ufficiently dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>NEITHER could it be &s;aid after this, that the legi&s;la|ture of that country any longer made laws for this but that it gave out commands; for wherein differed an act
<PB N="11" REF="10">of Parliament con&s;tructed on this principle, and operating in this manner, over an unrepre&s;ented people, from the orders of a military e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE Parliament of England, with re&s;pect to America, was not &s;eptennial but <HI>perpetual.</HI> It appeared to the lat|ter a body always in being. Its election or its expiration were to her the &s;ame as it its members &s;ucceeded by inhe|ritance, or went out by death, or lived for ever, or were appointed to it as a matter of office. Therefore for the people of England to have any ju&s;t conception of the mind of America, re&s;pecting this extraordinary act, they mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e all election and expiration in that country to cea&s;e for ever, and the pre&s;ent parliament, its heirs, &amp;c. to be perpetual; in this ca&s;e, I a&s;k, what would the mo&s;t clamorous of them think were an act to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, decla|ring the right of <HI>&s;uch a parliament</HI> to bind <HI>them</HI> in all ca|&s;es what&s;oever? For this word <HI>what&s;oever</HI> would go as effectually to their <HI>Magna Charta, Bill of Rights. Trial by Juries,</HI> &amp;c. as it went to the charters and forms of go|vermeat in America.</P>
<P>I AM per&s;uaded that the Gentleman to whom I addre&s;s remarks will not, after the pa&s;&s;ing this act, &s;ay, <Q>That the <HI>principles</HI> of admini&s;tration had not been <HI>changed</HI> in America, and that the maxims of govern|ment had there been <HI>always the &s;ame.</HI></Q> For here is, in principle, a total overthr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w of the whole; and not a &s;ubver&s;ion only, but an annihilation of the foundation of liberty, and ab&s;olute domination e&s;tabli&s;hed in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>THE Abbe likewi&s;e &s;tates the ca&s;e exceedingly wrong and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">juriou&s;ly, when he &s;ays, <Q>that <HI>the whole</HI> que&s;tion was reduced to the knowing whether the mother coun|try had, or had not, a right to lay, directly, or in|directly a <HI>&s;light</HI> tax upon the colonies</Q>&mdash;This was <HI>not the whole</HI> of the que&s;tion; neither was the <HI>quantity</HI> of the tax the object&punc; either to the Mini&s;try or to the Ame|ricans. It was the principle, of which the tax made but a part&punc; and the quantity &s;till le&s;s, that formed the ground on which America oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">THE tax on tea, which is the tax here alluded to was neither more or le&s;s than an experiment to e&s;tabli&s;h the practice of the declaratory law upon; modelled into the more fa&s;hionable phra&s;e <HI>of the univer&s;al &s;upremacy of Parliament.</HI> For until this time the declaratory law had lain dormant, and the framers of it had contented them|&s;elves with barely declaring an opinion.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the <HI>whole</HI> que&s;tion with America, in the opening of the di&s;pute, was &s;hall we be bound in all ca|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;oever by the Briti&s;h Parliament, or &s;hall we not? For &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tea or tax act implied an acknowledg|ment of the declaratory act, or in other words, of the univer&s;al &s;upremacy of Parliament, which as they never intended to do, it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould oppo&s;e it, in its fir&s;t &s;tage of execution.</P>
<P>IT is probable, the Abbe has been led into this mi&s;take by peru&s;ing detached pieces in &s;ome of the American news|papers; for in a ea&s;e, where all were intere&s;ted, every one had a right to give his opinion; and there were ma|ny, who with the be&s;t intentions, did not chuse the be&s;t&punc; nor indeed the true ground, to defend their cau&s;e upon. They felt them&s;elves right by a general impul&s;e, without being able to &s;eparate, analyze, and arrange the parts.</P>
<P>I AM &s;omewhat unwilling to examine too minutely into the whole of this extraordinary pa&s;&s;age of the Abbe, le&s;t I &s;hould appear to treat it with &s;everity; otherwi&s;e I could &s;how that not a &s;ingle declaration is ju&s;tly founded: For in&s;tance, the reviving an ob&s;olete act of the reign of Henry the eighth, and fitting it to the Americans by au|thority of which they were to be &s;eized and brought from America to England, and there impri&s;oned and tried for any &s;uppo&s;ed offences, was, in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, <HI>to tear them, by the arbitrary power of Parliament, from the arms of their families and friends and drag them not only to dreary but di&s;tant dungeons.</HI> Yet this act was con|trived &s;ome years before the breaking out of ho&s;tilities. And again, though the blood of martyrs and patriots had not &s;treamed on the &s;caffolds, it &s;treamed in the &s;treets,
<PB N="13" REF="12">in the ma&s;&s;acre of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, by the Bri|ti&s;h &s;oldiery in the year 1770.</P>
<P>HAD the Abbe &s;aid that the cau&s;es which produced the revolution in America were originally <HI>different</HI> from tho&s;e which produced revolutions in other parts of the globe, he had been right. Here the value and quality of liberty, the nature of government, and the dignity of man, were known and under&s;tood, and the attachment of the Ame|ricans to the&s;e principles produced the revolution as a natural and almo&s;t unavoidable con&s;equence. They had no particular family to &s;et up or pull down. Nothing of per&s;onality was incorporated with their cau&s;e. They &s;tarted even handed with each other, and went no fa&s;ter into the &s;everal &s;tages of it, than they were driven by the unrelenting and imperious conduct of Britain. Nay, in the la&s;t act, the declaration of independence, they had nearly been too late; for had it not been declared at the exact time it was, I &s;ee no period in their affairs &s;ince, in which it could have been declared with the &s;ame effect, and probably not at all.</P>
<P>BUT the object being formed before the rever&s;e of for|tune took place, that is before the operations of the gloo|my campaign of 1776, their honor, their intere&s;t, their every thing called loudly on them to maintain it; and that glow of thought and energy of heart, which even a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of independence in&s;pires, gave confidence to their hopes and re&s;olution to their conduct, which a &s;tate of dependence could never have reached. They looked forward to happier days and &s;cenes of re&s;t, and qualified the hard&s;hips of the campaign by contemplating the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their new born &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IF on the other hand we take a review of what part Britain has acted, we &s;hall find every thing which ought to make a nation blu&s;h. The mo&s;t vulgar abu&s;e, accom|panied by that &s;pecies of haughtine&s;s, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the hero of a mob from the character of a gentleman; it was equally as much from her manners as from her in|ju&s;tice that &s;he lo&s;t the colonies.

<P>A UNION &s;o exten&s;ive&punc; continued and determined &s;uf|fering with patience and never in de&s;pair could not have been produced by common cau&s;es. I mu&s;t be &s;omething capable of reaching the whole &s;oul of man and arming it with perpetual energy In vein is it to look for pre|cedents among the revolutions of former ages to find out&punc; by compari&s;on, the cau&s;es of this. The &s;pring, the progre&s;s, the object&punc; the con&s;equences ray the men, their habits of thinking and all the circum&s;tances of the country are different. Tho&s;e of other nations are in general, little more than the hi&s;tory of their quarrels. They are marked by no important character in the an|nals of events; mixt in the ma&s;s of general matters they occupy but a common page; and while the chief of the &s;ucce&s;sful parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns &s;lept into power, the plundered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ul|titude &s;at down and &s;orrowed. Few very few of them are accompanied with reformation either in government or manners; many of them with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate profligacy. Triumph on the one &s;ide and mi&s;ery on the other were the only events.

<P>BUT as the principles of the pre&s;ent revolution dif|fered from tho&s;e which preceeded it, &s;o likewi&s;e has the conduct of America both in government and war Nei|ther the foul finger of di&s;grace nor the bloody hand of vengeance has hitherto put a blot upon her fame. Her victories have received lu&s;tre from a greatne&s;s of lenity; and her laws been permitted to &s;lumber&punc; where they might ju&s;tly have awakened to puni&s;h. War, &s;o much
<PB N="15" REF="14">the trade of the world, has here been only the bu&s;ine&s;s of nece&s;&s;ity; and when the nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall cea&s;e, her very enemies mu&s;t confe&s;s, that as &s;he drew the &s;word in her ju&s;t defence, &s;he u&s;ed it without cruelty and &s;heathed it without revenge.</P>
<P>AS it is not my de&s;ign to extend the&s;e remarks to a hi&s;tory, I &s;hall now take my leave of this pa&s;&s;age of the Abbe, with an ob&s;ervation, which until &s;omething un|folds it&s;elf to convince me otherwi&s;e, I cannot avoid be|lieving to be true;&mdash;which is that it was the fix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deter|mination of the Briti&s;h cabinet to quarrel with America at all events.</P>
<P>THEY (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he members who compo&s;e the cabinet) had no doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, if they could once bring it to the i&s;&s;ue of a battle; and they expected from a conque&s;t, what they could neither propo&s;e with decency no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hope for by negociation. The charters and con&s;titutions of the co|lonies were become to them matters of offence, and their rapid progre&s;s in property and population were di&s;gu&s;t|ingly beheld as the growing and natural means of inde|pendence. They &s;aw no way to retain them long but by reducing them in time. A conque&s;t would at once have made them both lords and landlords; and put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion both of the revenue and rental. The whole trouble of government would have cea&s;ed in a vic|tory, and a final end been put to remon&s;trance &amp; debate. The experience of the &s;tamp act had taught them how to quarrel with the advantages of cover and convenience, and they had nothing to do but to renew the &s;cene, and put contention into motion. They hoped for a rebellion, and they made one They expected a declaration of inde|pendence, and they were not di&s;appointed. But after this, they looked for victory, and they obtained a defeat.</P>
<P>In this be taken as the generating cau&s;e of the conte&s;t, then is every part of the conduct of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try con&s;i&s;tent from the commencement of the di&s;pute, until the &s;igning the treaty of Paris, after which, conque&s;t be|coming doubtful, they retreated to negociation, and were again defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">THO' the Abbe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and di&s;plays great powers of genius and is a ma&s;ter of &s;tile and language, he &s;eems not to pay equal attention to the office of an hi&s;torian. His facts are coldly and carele&s;&s;ly &s;tated. They neither inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the reader nor intere&s;t him.

<P>THE actions of Trenton and Princeton in New-Jer&s;ey, in December 1776 and January following on which the fate of America &s;tood for a while trembling on the point of &s;u&s;pence, and from which the mo&s;t important con&s;e|quences followed, are compri&s;ed within a &s;ingle paragraph faintly conceived, and barren of character, circum&s;tance and de&s;cription.</P>
<P>"ON the 25th of December," &s;ays the Abbe, <Q>they (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Americans) cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and fell <HI>acci|dentally</HI> upon Trenton, which was occupied by fifteen hundred of the twelve thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians, &s;old in &s;o b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e a manner by their avaricious ma&s;ter to the King of Great Britain. This corps was <HI>ma&s;&s;acred</HI> taken, or di&s;per&s;ed. Eight days after, three Engli&s;h regiments were in like manner driven from Princeton, but after having better &s;upported their reputation than the foreign troops in their pay.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is all the account which is given of the&s;e mo&s;t intere&s;ting events. The Abbe has preceded them by two or three pages on the military operations of both armies, from the time of General Howe arriving before New-York from Halifax, and the va&s;t reinforcements of Briti&s;h and
<PB N="17" REF="16">foreign troops with Lord Howe from England. But in the&s;e, there is &s;o much mi&s;take, and &s;o many omi&s;&s;ions, that, to &s;et them right, mu&s;t be the bu&s;ine&s;s of hi&s;tory and not of a letter. The action of Long I&s;land is but barely hinted at, and the operations at the White Plains wholly omitted: as are likewi&s;e the attack and lo&s;s of fort Wa&s;hington, with a garri&s;on of about two thou&s;and five hundred men, and the precipitate evacuation of Fort Lee, in con&s;equence thereof; which losses were in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of the retreat through the Jer&s;ies to the Delaware, a di&s;tance of about ninety miles. Neither is the manner of the retreat de&s;cribed, which, from the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the nature of the country, the nearne&s;s of the two armies, (&s;ometimes within &s;ight and &s;hot of each o|ther for &s;uch a length of way) the rear of the one employ|ed in pulling down bridges, and the van of the other in building them up, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be accompanied with many intere&s;ting circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IT is a period of di&s;tre&s;&s;es. A cri&s;is rather of dan|ger than of hope. There is no de&s;cription can do it ju&s;tice; and even the actors in it, looking back upon the &s;cene, are &s;urpri&s;ed how they got through; and at a lo&s;s to account for tho&s;e powers of the mind and &s;prings of animation, by which they with&s;tood the force of accumu|lated misfortune.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that the time for which the army was inli&s;ted, would carry the campaign &s;o far into the winter, that the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, and the con&s;equent con|dition of the roads, would prevent any material opera|tion of the enemy, until the new army could be rai&s;ed for the next year. And I mention it as a matter worthy of attention by all future hi&s;torians, that the movements of the American army, until the attack upon the He&s;&s;ian po&s;t at Trenton, the 26th December, are to be con&s;ider|ed as operating to effect no other principal purpo&s;e than delay, and to wear away the campaign under all the di&s;|advantages of an unequal force, with as little misfortune as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">BUT the lo&s;s of the garri&s;on at Fort-Wa&s;hington on the 16th of November, and the expiration of the time of a con&s;iderable part of the army, &s;o early as the 30th of the &s;ame month, and which were to be followed by al|mo&s;t daily expirations afterwards made retreat the only final expedient. To the&s;e circum&s;tances may be added the forlorn and de&s;titute condition of the few that re|mained; for the garri&s;on of Fort-Lee, which compo&s;ed almo&s;t the whole of the retreat, had been obliged to abandon it &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, that every article of &s;tores and baggage was left behind, and in this de&s;titute con|dition, without tent or blanket, and without any other uten&s;ils to dre&s;s their provi&s;ion than what they procured by the way, they performed a march of about ninety miles, and had the addre&s;s and management to prolong it to the &s;pace of nineteen days.</P>
<P>BY this unexpected or rather unthought of turn of affairs, the country was in an in&s;tant &s;urpri&s;ed into con|fu&s;ion, and found an enemy within its bowels without an army to oppo&s;e him. There were no &s;uccours to be had, but from the free will offering of the inhabitants. All was choice and every man rea&s;oned for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT was in this &s;ituation of affairs, equally calculated to confound or to in&s;pire, that the gentleman, the merchant, the farmer, the trade&s;man and the labourer mutually turned from all the conveniences of home, to perform the duties of private &s;oldiers and undergo the &s;everities of a winter campaign. The delay &s;o judiciou&s;ly contrived on the retreat, afforded time for the volunteer reinforce|ments to join General Wa&s;hington on the Delaware.</P>
<P>THE Abbe is likewi&s;e wrong in &s;aying, that the Ame|rican army fell <HI>accidentally</HI> on Trenton. It was the ve|ry object for which General Wa&s;hington cro&s;&s;ed the De|laware in the dead of the night and in the mid&s;t of &s;now, &s;torms, and ice; and which he immediately re-cro&s;&s;ed with his pri&s;oners, as &s;oon as he had accompli&s;hed his purpo&s;e. Neither was the intended enterpri&s;e a &s;ecret to the enemy, information having been &s;ent of it by let|ter
<PB N="19" REF="18">from a Briti&s;h officer at Princetown to Colonel Rolle, who commanded the He&s;&s;ians at Trenton, which letter was afterwards found by the Americans. Neverthele&s;s, the po&s;t was completely &s;urpri&s;ed. A &s;mall circum&s;tance which had the appearance of mi&s;take on the part of the Americans, led to a more capital and real mi&s;take on the part of Rolle.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e was this. A detachment of twenty or thirty Americans had been &s;ent acro&s;s the river from a po&s;t a few miles above, by an officer unacquainted with the in|tended attack; the&s;e were net by a body of He&s;&s;ians on the night, to which the information pointed, which was Chri&s;tmas night, and repul&s;ed. Nothing further appear|ing, and the He&s;&s;ians, mi&s;taking this for the advanced party, &s;uppo&s;ed the enterpri&s;e di&s;concerted, which at that time was not began, and under this idea returned to their quarters; &s;o that, what might have rai&s;ed an a|larm, and brought the Americans into an ambu&s;cade, &s;erved to take off the force of an information and pro|mote the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize. Soon after day light General Wa&s;hington entered the town, and after a little oppo&s;ition, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, with upwards of nine hundred pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS combination of equivocal circum&s;tances, falling within what the Abbe&s;tiles <HI>"the wide empire of chance,"</HI> would have afforded a fine field for thought, and I wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of that elegance of reflection he is &s;o capable of u&s;ing, that he had known it.</P>
<P>BUT the action at Princeton was accompanied by a &s;till greater embarra&s;&s;ment of matters, and followed by more extraordinary con&s;equences. The Americans, by a hap|py &s;troke of general&s;hip, in this in&s;tance, not only derang|ed and defeated all the plans of the Briti&s;h in the intend|ed moment of execution, but drew from their po&s;ts the enemy they were not able to drive, and oblige them to clo&s;e the campaign. As the circum&s;tance is a curio&s;ity in war, and not well under&s;tood in Europe, I &s;hall, as con|ci&s;ely as I can, relate the principal parts; they may &s;erve
<PB N="20" REF="19">to prevent future hi&s;torians from error, and recover from forgetfulne&s;s a &s;cene of magnificent fortitude.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the &s;urprize of the He&s;&s;ians at Trenton, General Wa&s;hington recro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, which at this place is about three quarters of a mile over, and rea&s;&s;umed his former po&s;t on the Penn&s;ylvania &s;ide. Trenton remained unoccupied, and the enemy were po&s;ted at Princeton, twelve miles di&s;tant, on the road towards New-York. The weather was now growing very &s;evere, and as there were very few hou&s;es near the &s;hore where General Wa&s;hington had taken his &s;tation, the greate&s;t part of his army remained out in the woods and fields.&mdash;The&s;e, with &s;ome other circum&s;tances, induced the recro&s;s|ing the Delaware and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Trenton. It was undoubtedly a bold adventure, and carried with it the panic &s;truck condition of the enemy on the lo&s;s of the He&s;&s;ian po&s;t. But in order to give a ju&s;t idea of the af|fair, it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould de&s;cribe the place.</P>
<P>TRENTON is &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, about three quarters of a mile di&s;tant from the Delaware, on the ea&s;t|ern or Jer&s;ey &s;ide; and is cut into two divi&s;ions by a &s;mall creek or rivulet, &s;ufficient to turn a mill which is on it; after which it empties it&s;elf at nearly right angles into the Delaware. The upper divi&s;ion, which is to the north ea&s;t, contains about &s;eventy or eighty hou&s;es,&mdash;and the lower about forty or fifty. The ground on each &s;ide this creek, and on which the hou&s;es are, is likewi&s;e ri&s;ing, and the two divi&s;ions pre&s;ent an agreeable pro&s;pect to each other, with the creek between, on which there is a &s;mall &s;tone bridge of one arch.</P>
<P>SCARCELY had General Wa&s;hington taken po&s;t here, and before the &s;everal parties of militia, out on detach|ments, or on their way could be collected, than the Briti&s;h, leaving behind them a &s;trong garri&s;on at Princeton, march|ed &s;uddenly and entered Trenton at the upper or north ea&s;t quarter. A party of the Americans &s;kirmi&s;hed with the advanced party of the Briti&s;h, to afford time for removing
<PB N="21" REF="20">the &s;tores and baggage, and withdrawing over the bridge.</P>
<P>IN a little time the Briti&s;h had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one half of the town, General Wa&s;hington of the other;&mdash;and the creek only &s;eparated the two armies. Nothing could be a more critical &s;ituation than this;&mdash;and if ever the fate of America depended on the event of a day, it was now. The Delaware was filling fa&s;t with large &s;heets of driving ice, and was impa&s;&s;ible, &s;o that no retreat into Penn&s;ylva|nia could be effected; neither is it po&s;&s;ible, in the face of an enemy, to pa&s;s a river of &s;uch extent. The roads were broken and rugged with the fro&s;t, and the main road was occupied by the enemy.</P>
<P>ABOUT four o'clock a party of the Briti&s;h approached the bridge, with a de&s;ign to gain it, but were repul&s;ed. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made no more attempts, though the creek it&s;elf is po&s;&s;ible any where between the bridge &amp; the Delaware. It runs into a rugged natural made ditch, over which a per&s;on may pa&s;s with little difficulty, the &s;tream being rapid and &s;hallow. Evening was now coming on, and the Briti&s;h, believing they had all the advantages they could wi&s;h for, and that they could u&s;e them when they plea&s;ed, di&s;conti|nued all further operations, and held them&s;elves prepared to make the attack next morning.</P>
<P>BUT the next morning produced a &s;cene, as elegant as it was unexpected. The Briti&s;h were under arms and ready to march to action, when one of their light-hor&s;e from Princeton, came &s;uriou&s;ly down the &s;treet, with an account, that General Wa&s;hington had that morning at|tacked and carried the Briti&s;h po&s;t at that place, and was proceeding on to &s;eize the magazine at Brun&s;wick; on which the Briti&s;h, who were then on the point of making an a&s;&s;ault on the evacuated camp of the Americans, wheel|ed about, and in a fit of con&s;ternation, marched for Princeton.</P>
<P>THIS retreat is one of tho&s;e extraordinary circum&s;tan|ces, that in future ages may probably pa&s;s for fable. For
<PB N="22" REF="21">it will with difficulty be believed, that two armies, on which &s;uch important con&s;equences depended, &s;hould be crouded into &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace as Trenton; and that the one, on the eve of an engagement, when every ear is &s;up|po&s;ed to be open, and every watchfulne&s;s employed &s;hould move compleatly from the ground, with all its &s;tores bag|gage, and artillery, unknown, and even un&s;u&s;pected by the other. And &s;o entirely were the Briti&s;h deceived, that when they heard the report of the cannon and &s;mall arms at Princeton, they &s;uppo&s;ed it to be thunder, though in the depth of winter.</P>
<P>GENERAL Wa&s;hington, the better to cover and di&s;gui&s;e his retreat from Trenton, had ordered a line of fires to be lighted up in front of his camp. The&s;e not only &s;erved to give an appearance of going to re&s;t, and continuing that deception, but they effectually concealed from the Bri|ti&s;h whatever was acting behind them,&mdash;for flame can no more be &s;een through than a wall,&mdash;and in this &s;ituation, it may wi&s;h &s;ome propriety be &s;aid, they became a pillar of fire to the one army, and a pillar of a cloud to the other: after this, by a circuitous march of about eighteen miles, the Americans reached Princeton early in the morning.</P>
<P>THE number of pri&s;oners taken were between two and three hundred, with which General Wa&s;hington immedi|ately &s;et off. The van of the Briti&s;h army from Trenton entered Princeton about an hour after the Americans had left it, who continuing their match for the remainder of the day, arrived in the evening at a convenient &s;ituation, wide of the main road to Brun&s;wick, and about &s;ixteen miles di&s;tant from Princeton.&mdash;But &s;o wearied and ex|hau&s;ted were they, with the continual and unabated &s;ervice and fatigue of two days and a night, from action to action, without &s;helter and almo&s;t without refre&s;hment, that the bare and frozen ground, with no other covering than the &s;ky, became to them a place of comfortable re&s;t. By the&s;e two events, and with but little comparative force to ac|compli&s;h, which, but a few days before, threatened the country with de&s;truction. The Briti&s;h army, apprehen&s;ive
<PB N="23" REF="22">for the &s;afety of their magazines at Brun&s;wick, eighteen miles di&s;tant, marched immediately for that place, where they arrived late in the evening, and from which they made no attempts to move, for nearly five months.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;tated the principal outlines of the&s;e two mo&s;t intere&s;ting actions, I &s;hall now quit them, to put the Abbe right in his mi&s;tated account of the debt and paper money of America, wherein, &s;peaking of the&s;e matters, he &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>THESE ideal riches were rejected. The more the multiplication of them was urged by want, the greater did their depreciation grow. The Congre&s;s was indig|nant at the affronts given to its money, and declared all tho&s;e to be traitors to their country who &s;hould not receive it as they would have received gold it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>DID not this body know, that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are no more to be controled than feelings are? Did it not per|ceive, that in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is every rational man would be afraid of expo&s;ing his fortune? Did it not &s;ee, that at the beginning of a republic, it permitted to it&s;elf the exerci&s;e of &s;uch acts of de&s;poti&s;m as are unknown even in the countries which are moulded to, and become fa|miliar with &s;ervitude and oppre&s;&s;ion? Could it pretend that it did not puni&s;h a want of confidence with the pains which would have been &s;carcely merited by revolt and trea&s;on? Of all this was the Congre&s;s well aware? But it had no choice of means. Its de&s;pi&s;ed and de&s;pi|cable &s;craps of paper were actually thirty times below their original value, when more of them were ordered to be made. On the 13th of September, 1779, there was of this paper money, among&s;t the public, to the a|mount of &pound; 35,544,155. The &s;tate owed moreover &pound; 8,385,356, without reckoning the particular debts of &s;ingle provinces.</Q></P>
<P>IN the above recited pa&s;&s;ages, the Abbe &s;peaks as if the United States had contracted a debt of upwards of forty millions pounds &s;terling, be&s;ides the debts of individual
<PB N="24" REF="23">States. After which, &s;peaking of foreign trade with Ame|rica, he &s;ays, that <Q>tho&s;e countries in Europe, which are truly commercial ones, knowing that North Ame|rica had been reduced to contract debts at the epoch of even her greate&s;t pro&s;perity, wi&s;ely thought, that, in her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he would be able to pay but very little for what might be carried to her.</Q></P>
<P>I KNOW it mu&s;t be extremely difficult to make foreign|ers under&s;tand the nature and circum&s;tances of our paper money, becau&s;e there are natives, who do not under&s;tand it them&s;elves. But with us its fate is now determined. Common con&s;ent has con&s;igned it to re&s;t with that kind of regard which the long &s;ervice of inanimate things in|&s;en&s;ibly obtains from mankind. Every &s;tone in the bridge that has carried us over, &s;eems to have a claim upon our e&s;teem. But this was a corner &s;tone, and its u&s;efulne&s;s cannot be forgotten. There is &s;omething in a grateful mind which extends it&s;elf even to things that can neither be benefitted by regard, nor &s;uffer by neglect;&mdash;But &s;o it is; and almo&s;t every man is &s;en&s;ible of the effect.</P>
<P>BUT to return.&mdash;The paper money, though i&s;&s;ued from Congre&s;s under the name of dollars, did not come from that body always at that value. Tho&s;e which were i&s;&s;ued the fir&s;t year were equal to gold and &s;ilver; the &s;econd year le&s;s; the third &s;till le&s;s, and &s;o on for nearly the &s;pace of five years; at the end of which, I imagine that the whole value at which Congre&s;s might pay away the &s;everal emi&s;&s;ions, taking them together, was about ten or twelve millions pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>NOW as it would have taken ten or twelve millions &s;terling of taxes to carry on the war for five years, and, as while this money was i&s;&s;uing and likewi&s;e depreciating down to nothing, there were none, or few valuable taxes paid; con&s;equently the event to the public was the &s;ame, whether they &s;unk ten or twelve millions of ex|pended money, by depreciation, or paid ten or twelve millions by taxation; for as they did not do both, and cho&s;e to do one, the matter, in a general view, was
<PB N="25" REF="24">indifferent. And therefore, what the Abbe &s;uppo&s;es to be a debt, has now no exi&s;tence; it having been paid, by every body con&s;enting to reduce at his own expence, from the value of the bills continually pa&s;&s;ing among them&s;elves a &s;um equal to nearly what the expence of the war was for five years.</P>
<P>AGAIN. The paper money having now cea&s;ed, and the depreciation with it, and gold and &s;ilver &s;upplied its place, the war will now be carried on by taxation, which will draw from the public a con&s;iderable le&s;s &s;um than what the depreciation drew; but as while they pay the former, they do not &s;uffer the latter and as when they &s;uffered the latter, they did not pay the former, the thing will be nearly equal, with this moral advantage, that taxation occa&s;ions frugality and thought, and deprecia|tion produced di&s;&s;ipation and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND again. If a man's portion of taxes comes to le&s;s than what he lo&s;t by the depreciation, it proves the alte|ration is in his favor. If it comes to more, and he is ju&s;tly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it &s;hows that he did not &s;u&s;tain his proper &s;hare of depreciation, becau&s;e the one was as operatively his tax as the other.</P>
<P>IT is true, that it never was intended, neither was it fore&s;een, that the debt contained in the paper currency &s;hould &s;ink it&s;elf in this manner; but as by the voluntary conduct of all and of every one it has arrived at this fate, the debt is paid by tho&s;e who owed it. Perhaps nothing was ever &s;o univer&s;ally the act of a country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this. Government had no hand in it. Every man de|preciated his own money by his own con&s;ent, for &s;uch was the effect, which the rai&s;ing the nominal value of goods produced. But as by &s;uch reduction he &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s equal to what he mu&s;t have paid to &s;ink it by tax|ation, therefore the line of ju&s;tice is to con&s;ider his lo&s;s by the depreciation as his tax for that time, and not to tax him when the war is over, to make that money good in any other per&s;ons hands, which became nothing in his own.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">AGAIN. The paper currency was i&s;&s;ued for the ex|pre&s;s purpo&s;e of carrying on the war. It has performed that &s;ervice without any other material charge to the public, while it la&s;ted. But to &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;ome did, that, at the end of the war, it was to grow into gold or &s;ilver, or become equal thereto, was to &s;uppo&s;e that we were to <HI>get</HI> two hundred million of dollars by <HI>going to war,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>paying</HI> the co&s;t of carrying it on.</P>
<P>BUT if any thing in the &s;ituation of America, as to her currency or her circum&s;tances, yet remains not under&s;tood, then let it be remembered, that this war is the public's war; the people's war; the country's war. It is <HI>their</HI> independence that is to be &s;upported; <HI>their</HI> property that is to be &s;ecured; <HI>their</HI> country that is to be &s;aved. Here government, the army and the people, are mutually and reciprocally one. In other wars, kings may lo&s;e their thrones and their dominions; but here, the lo&s;s mu&s;t fall on the maje&s;ty of the multitude, and the property they are contending to &s;ave. Every man being &s;en&s;ible of this, he goes to the field, or pays his portion of the charge, as the &s;overeign of his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and when he is conquered a monarch falls.</P>
<P>THE remark which the Abbe in the conclu&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;age has made, re&s;pecting America contracting debts in the time of her pro&s;perity (by which he means before the breaking out of ho&s;tilities) &s;erves to &s;how, though he has not made the application, the very great commercial difference between a dependent and an independent country. In a &s;tate of dependence, and with a fettered commerce, though with all the advantages of peace, her trade could not balance it&s;elf, and &s;he annually run into debt. But now, in a &s;tate of independence, though in|volved in war, &s;he requires no credit; her &s;tores are full of merchandize, and gold and &s;ilver are become the cur|rency of the country. How the&s;e things have e&s;tabli&s;h|ed them&s;elves are difficult to account for: But they are facts, and facts are more powerful than arguments.</P>
<P>As it is probable this letter will undergo a re publica|tion
<PB N="27" REF="26">in Europe, the remarks here thrown together will &s;erve to &s;how the extreme follow of Britain in re&s;ting her hopes of &s;ucce&s;s on the extinction of our paper currency. The expectation is at once &s;o childi&s;h and forlorn, that it places her in the laughable condition of a fami&s;hed lion watching for prey at a &s;pider's web.</P>
<P>FROM this account of the currency, the Abbe pro|ceeds to &s;tate the condition of America in the winter 1777, and the &s;pring following; and clo&s;es his ob&s;erva|tions with mentioning the treaty of alliance, which was &s;igned in France, and the propo&s;itions of the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;try, which were rejected in America. But in the man|ner in which the Abbe has arranged his facts, there is a very material error, that not only he, but other Europe|an hi&s;torians have fallen into; none of them having a&s;|&s;igned the true cau&s;e why the Briti&s;h propo&s;als were re|jected, and all of them have a&s;&s;igned a wrong one.</P>
<P>IN the winter 1777, and &s;pring following, congre&s;s were a&s;&s;embled at York town in Penn&s;ylvania, the Briti&s;h were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia, and General Wa&s;hing|ton with the army were encamped in huts at the Valley-Forge, twenty-five miles di&s;tant therefrom. To all who can remember, it was a &s;ea&s;on of hard&s;hip, but not of de&s;pair; and the Abbe, &s;peaking of this period and its inconveniences, &s;ays,&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>A multitude of privations, added to &s;o many other misfortunes, might make the Americans regret their former tranquility, and incline them to an accommo|dation with England. In vain had the people been bound to the new government by the &s;acredne&s;s of oaths and the influence of religion. In vain had en|deavours been u&s;ed to convince them that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to treat &s;afely with a country, in which one parliament might overturn what &s;hould have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by another. In vain had they been threat|ened with the eternal re&s;entment of an exasperated and vindictive enemy. It was po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e di&s;|tant troubles might not be balanced by the weight of pre&s;ent evils.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"><Q>So thought the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, when they &s;ent to the New World public agents, authori&s;ed to offer eve|ry thing except independence to the&s;e very Americans, from whom they had two years before exacted an un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It is not improbable but that by this plan of conciliation, a few months &s;ooner, &s;ome effect might have been produced. But at the period at which it was propo&s;ed by the Court of London, it was rejected with di&s;dain, becau&s;e this mea&s;ure ap|peared but as an argument of fear and weakne&s;s. The people were already re a&s;&s;ured. The Congre&s;s, the Generals, the troops, the bold and &s;kilful men, in each colony had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the authority; every thing had recovered its fir&s;t &s;pirit. <HI>This was the effect of a treaty of friend&s;hip and commerce between the United States and the Court of Ver&s;ailles, &s;igned the 6th of February,</HI> 1778.</Q></P>
<P>ON this pa&s;&s;age of the Abbe's I cannot help remark|ing, that, to unite time with circum&s;tance, is a mate|rial nicety in hi&s;tory; the want of which frequently throws is into endle&s;s confu&s;ion and mi&s;take, occa&s;ions a total &s;eparation between cau&s;es and con&s;equences, and connects them with others they are not immediately, and &s;ometimes not at all, related to.</P>
<P>THE Abbe, in &s;aying that the offer: of the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;try "were rejected with di&s;dain," it <HI>right,</HI> as to the <HI>fact,</HI> but <HI>wrong</HI> as to the <HI>time;</HI> and this error in the time, has occa&s;ioned him to be mi&s;taken in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;igning the treaty of Paris the 6th of February, 1778, could have no effect on the mind or politics of America, until it was <HI>known in America;</HI> and therefore, when the Abbe &s;ays, that the rejection of the Briti&s;h of|fers was in con&s;equence of the alliance <HI>being known</HI> in America; which was not the ca&s;e: And by this mi&s;take he not only takes from her the reputation which her un|&s;haken fortitude in that trying &s;ituation de&s;erves, but it likewi&s;e led very injuriou&s;ly to &s;uppo&s;e, that had &s;he <HI>not
<PB N="29" REF="28">known</HI> of the treaty, the offers would probably have been accepted; whereas &s;he knew nothing of the treaty at the time of the rejection, and con&s;equently did not reject them on that ground.</P>
<P>THE propo&s;itions or offers abovementioned were con|tained in two bills brought into the Briti&s;h Parliament by Lord North on the 17th of February, 1778. Tho&s;e bills were hurried thro' both Hou&s;es with unu&s;ual ha&s;te, and before they had gone thro' all the cu&s;tomary forms of Par|liament, copies of them were &s;ent over to Lord Howe and General Howe, then in Philadelphia, who were likewi&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners. Gen. Howe ordered them to be printed in Philadelphia, and &s;ent copies of them by a flag, to Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, to be forwarded to Congre&s;s, at York|town, where they arrived the 21&s;t of April, 1778. Thus much for the arrival of the bills in America.</P>
<P>CONGRESS, as is their u&s;ual mode, appointed a com|mittee from their own body, to examine them, and report thereon. The report was bro't in the next day (the 22d) was read, and unanimou&s;ly agreed to, entered on their journals, and publi&s;hed for the information of the country. Now this report mu&s;t be the rejection to which the Abbe alludes, becau&s;e Congre&s;s gave no other formal opinion on tho&s;e bills and propo&s;itions: And on a &s;ub&s;equent appli|cation from the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, dated the 27th of May, and received at York Town the 6th of June, Con|gre&s;s immediately referred them for an an&s;wer to their printed re&s;olves of the 22d of April. Thus much for the rejection of the offers.</P>
<P>ON the 2d of May, that is, eleven days after the above rejection was made, the treaty between the United States and France, arrived at Yorktown; and until this mo|ment, Congre&s;s had not the lea&s;t notice or idea, that &s;uck a mea&s;ure was in any train of execution. But le&s;t this declaration of mine &s;hould pa&s;s only for a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall &s;upport it by proof, for it is material to the character and principle of the revolution to &s;how, that no condition of America, &s;ince the declaration of independence, however
<PB N="30" REF="29">trying and &s;evere, ever operated to produce the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of yielding it up either by force, di&s;tre&s;s, artifice or per&s;ua&s;ion. And this proof is the more nece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e it was the &s;y&s;tem of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try at this time, as well as before and &s;ince, to hold out to the European powers that America was unfix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in her re&s;olutions and policy; hoping, by this artifice, to le&s;&s;en her reputation in Europe, and weaken the confidence which tho&s;e powers, or any of them, might be inclined to place in her.</P>
<P>AT the time the&s;e matters were tran&s;acting, I was &s;e|cretary in the foreign department of Congre&s;s. All the <HI>political</HI> letters from the American Commi&s;&s;ioners re&s;ted in my hands,&mdash;and all that were officially written&punc; went from my office; and &s;o far from Congre&s;s knowing any thing of the &s;igning the treaty, at the time they rejected the Briti&s;h offers, they had not received a line of informa|tion from their Commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris, on any &s;ubject whatever, for upwards of a twelve month. Probably the lo&s;s of the port of Philadelphia, and the navigation of the Delaware, together with the dangers of the &s;eas, covered at this time with Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, contributed to the di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>ONE packet, it is true, arrived at Yorktown, in Janu|ary preceding, which was about three months before the arrival of the treaty; but &s;trange as it may appear, every letter had been taken out, before it was put on board the ve&s;&s;el which brought it from France, and blank white pa|per put in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;tated the time when the propo&s;als from the Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners were fir&s;t received, and likewi&s;e the time when the treaty of alliance arrived, and &s;hewn that the rejection of the former was eleven days prior to the arrival of the latter, and without the lea&s;t knowledge of &s;uch circum&s;tance having taken place, or being about to take place; the rejection, therefore, mu&s;t, and ought to be attributed to the fixt unvaried &s;entiments of Ameri|ca re&s;pecting the enemy &s;he is at war with, and her de|termination to &s;upport her independence to the la&s;t po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="31" REF="30">effort, and not to any new circum&s;tance in her favour, which at that time &s;he did not and could not know of.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there is a vigor of determination and &s;pirit of defiance in the language of the rejection, (which I here &s;ubjoin) which derive their greate&s;t glory by appearing before the treaty was known; for that which is bravery in di&s;tre&s;s, becomes in&s;ult in pro&s;perity: and the treaty placed America on &s;uch a &s;trong foundation, that had &s;he then known it, the an&s;wer which &s;he gave, would have appear|ed rather as an air of triumph, than as the glowing &s;e|renity of fortitude.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the Abbe appears to have entirely mi&s;taken the matter: for in&s;tead of attributing the rejec|tion of the propo&s;itions to <HI>our knowledge</HI> of that event. And then the rea&s;on why they were hurried over to America in the &s;tate of bills, that is, before they were pa&s;&s;ed into acts, is ea&s;ily accounted for, which is, that they might have the chance of reaching America before any know|ledge of the treaty &s;hould arrive, which they were lucky enough to do, and there met the fate they &s;o richly me|rited. That the&s;e bills were brought into the Briti&s;h Par|liament after the treaty with France was &s;igned is proved from the dates: The treaty being on the 6th, and the bills the 17th of February. And that the &s;igning the treaty was known in Parliament when the bills were bro't in, is likewi&s;e proved by a &s;peech of Mr. Charles Fox, on the &s;aid 17th of February, who in reply to Lord North, in|formed the Hou&s;e of the treaty being &s;igned, and chal|lenged the Mini&s;ter's knowledge of the &s;ame fact.<NOTE N="*)" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<HEAD>IN CONGRESS, April 22d, 1778.</HEAD>
<P>THE Committee to whom was referred the General's letter of the <HI>18th,</HI> containing a certain printed paper &s;ent from Philadelphia, purporting to be the draught of a Bill for declaring the <HI>inten&s;ions</HI> of the Parliament of Great Britain, as to the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of what they are plea&s;ed to term their <HI>right</HI> of impo&s;ing taxes within the&s;e United States; and al&s;o the draught
<PB N="32" REF="31">of a bill to enable the King of Great Britain to appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners, with powers to treat, con&s;ult and agree upon the means of quieting cer|tain di&s;orders within the &s;aid States, beg leave to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid paper being indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated by emi&s;&s;aries of the enemy, in a partial and &s;ecret manner, the &s;ame ought to be forthwith printed for the public in|formation.</P>
<P>The Committee cannot a&s;certain whether the contents of the &s;aid paper have been framed in Philadelphia, or in Great Britain, much le&s;s whether the &s;ame are really and truly intended to be brought into the Parliament of that kingdom, or whether the &s;aid Parliament will confer there|on the u&s;ual &s;olemnities of their laws. But are inclined to believe this will happen, for the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. Becau&s;e their General hath made divers feeble efforts to &s;et on foot &s;ome kind of treaty during the la&s;t winter, though, either from a mi&s;taken idea of his own dignity and importance, the want of information, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, he hath not made application to tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with a proper authority.</P>
<P N="2">"2dly. Becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e that the fallacious idea of a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities will render the&s;e States remi&s;s in their preparations for war.</P>
<P N="3">"3rdly. Becau&s;e believing the Americans wearied with war, they &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall accede to their terms for the &s;ake of peace.</P>
<P N="4">"4thly. Becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e that our negociations may be &s;ubject to a like corrupt influence with their debates.</P>
<P N="5">"5thly. Becau&s;e they expect from this &s;tep the &s;ame effects they did from what one of their mini&s;ters thought pro|per to call his <HI>conciliatory motion,</HI> viz. That it will pre|vent foreign powers from giving aid to the&s;e States; that
<PB N="33" REF="32">it will lead their own &s;ubjects to continue a little longer the pre&s;ent war; and that it will detach &s;ome weak men in America from the cau&s;e of freedom and virtue.</P>
<P N="6">"6thly. Becau&s;e their King, from his own &s;hewing, hath rea&s;on to apprehend that his fleets and armies, in&s;tead of being employed again&s;t the territories of the&s;e States, will be nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of his own dominions. And</P>
<P N="7">"7thly. Becau&s;e the impracticability of &s;ubjugating this country being every day more and more manife&s;t, it is their intere&s;t to extricate them&s;elves from the war upon any terms.</P>
<P>The Committee beg leave further to ob&s;erve, That&punc; upon a &s;uppo&s;ition the matters contained in the &s;aid paper will really go into the Briti&s;h Statute Book, they &s;erve to &s;hew, in a clear point of view, the weakne&s;s and wicked|ne&s;s of the enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Their weakne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;ed they formerly declared, not only that they had a right to bind the inhabitants of the&s;e States in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, but al&s;o that the &s;aid inhabitants &s;hould <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> and <HI>unconditionally</HI> &s;ubmit to the exerci&s;e of that right And this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they have endeavoured to exact by the &s;word. Receding from this claim therefore&punc; under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;hews their inability to enforce it.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Becau&s;e their Prince hath heretofore rejected the humble&s;t petitions of the Repre&s;entatives of America, praying to be con&s;idered as &s;ubjects, and protected in the enjoyment of peace, liberty and &s;afety; and hath waged a mo&s;t cruel war again&s;t them, and employed the &s;avages to butcher innocent women and children But now the &s;ame Prince pretends to treat with tho&s;e very Repre&s;entatives, and grant to the <HI>arms</HI> of America what he refu&s;ed to her <HI>prayers.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="34" REF="33">3dly. Becau&s;e they have uniformly laboured to conquer this continent, rejecting every idea of accommodation pro|po&s;ed to them from a confidence in their own &s;trength. Wherefore it is evident, from the change in their mode of attack that they have lo&s;t this confidence. And</P>
<P N="4">4thly Becau&s;e the con&s;tant language, &s;poken not only by their Mini&s;ters, but by the mo&s;t public and authentic acts of the nation, hath been that it is incompatible with their dignity to treat with the Americans while they have arms in their hands. Notwith&s;tanding which, and offer is now about to be made for treaty.</P>
<P><HI>THE WICKEDNESS and INSINCERITY</HI> of the enemy appear from the following con&s;iderations:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Either the <HI>Bills</HI> now to be pa&s;&s;ed contain a di|rect or indirect ce&s;&s;ion of a part of their former claims, or they do not If they do, then it is acknowledged that they have &s;acrificed many brave men in an unju&s;t quarrel. If they do not then they are calculated to deceive America into terms to which neither argument before the war, nor force &s;ince, could procure her a&s;&s;ent</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Bills</HI> appears from the title&punc; to be a declaration of the <HI>intentiors</HI> of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment concerning the exerci&s;e of the <HI>right of impo&s;ing taxes</HI> within the&s;e States. Wherefore &s;hould the&s;e States treat under the &s;aid Bill they would <HI>indirectly</HI> acknowledge that right, to obtain which acknowledgment the pre&s;ent war hath been avowedly undertaken and pro&s;ecuted on the part of Great Britain</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Should &s;uch pretended right be &s;o acquie&s;ced in then of con&s;equence the &s;ame might be exerci&s;ed when|ever the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hould find them&s;elves in a dif|ferent <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition;</HI> &s;ince it mu&s;t depend upon the&s;e, and &s;uch like contingences, how far men will act ac|cording to their former <HI>intentions.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="35" REF="34">4thly. The &s;aid fir&s;t Bill, in the body thereof&punc; contain|eth no new matter, but is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with the motion before mentioned, and liable to all the objections which lay again&s;t the &s;aid motion, excepting the following particular, viz. that <HI>by the motion</HI> actual taxation was to be &s;u&s;pended, &s;o long as America &s;hould give as much as the &s;aid parlia|ment might think proper: Whereas, <HI>by the propo&s;ed Bill,</HI> it is to be &s;u&s;pended, as long as future Parliaments conti|nue of the &s;ame mind with the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. From the &s;econd Bill it appears, that the Briti&s;h King&punc; may, if he plea&s;es, appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners to <HI>treat</HI> and <HI>agree</HI> with tho&s;e, whom they plea&s;e, about a vari|ety of things therein mentioned. But &s;uch treaties and a|greements are to be of no validity without the concurrence of the &s;aid Parliament, except &s;o far as they relate to the <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion</HI> of ho&s;tilities, and of certain of their acts, the granting of pardons, and the appointing of Governors to the&s;e &s;overeign, free and independent States. Wherefore, the &s;aid Parliament have re&s;erved to them&s;elves, in <HI>expre&s;s words,</HI> the power of &s;etting a&s;ide any &s;uch treaty and ta|king the advantage of any circum&s;tances which may ari&s;e to &s;ubject this continent to their u&s;urpations.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. The &s;aid Bill, by holding forth a tender of pardon, implies a criminality in our ju&s;tifiable re&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;equently, to treat under it would be an implied ac|knowledgment, that the inhabitants of the&s;e States were, what Britain has declared them to be, <HI>Rebels.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7thly. The inhabitants of the&s;e States being claimed by them as &s;ubjects, they may infer, from the nature of the ne|gociation now pretended to be &s;et on foot, that the &s;aid in|habitants would of right be afterwards bound by &s;uch laws as they &s;hould make. Wherefore any agreement entered in|to on &s;uch negociation might at any future time be repealed.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="36" REF="35">8thly. Becau&s;e the &s;aid Bill purports&punc; that the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners therein mentioned may treat with private indivi|duals; a mea&s;ure highly derogatory to the dignity of natio|nal character.</P>
<P>From all which it appears evident to your Committee, that the &s;aid Bills are intended to operate upon the hopes and fears of the good people of the&s;e States, &s;o as to create divi|&s;ions among them, and a defection from the common cau&s;e, now by the ble&s;&s;ing of Divine Providence drawing near to a favourable i&s;&s;ue. That they are the &s;equel of that in&s;idi|ous plan, which, from the days of the Stamp act down to the pre&s;ent time, hath involved this country in contention and blood&s;hed. And that, as in other ca&s;es &s;o in this, although circum&s;tances may force them at times to recede from their unju&s;tifiable claim, there can be no doubt but they will as heretofore, upon the fir&s;t favourable occa&s;ion, again di&s;play that la&s;t of domination, which hath rent in &s;wain the migh|ty empire of Britain.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, the Committee beg leave to re|port it as their opinion that as the Americans united in this arduous conte&s;t upon principles of common intere&s;t, for the defence of common rights and privileges, which union hath been cemented by common calamities and by mutual good of|fices and affection, &s;o the great cau&s;e for which they contend&punc; and in which all mankind are intere&s;ted, mu&s;t derive its &s;ucce&s;s from the continuance of that union. Wherefore any man or body of men, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to make any &s;epa|rate or partial convention or agreement with Commi&s;&s;ioners under the crown of Great Britain, or any of them, ought to be con&s;idered and treated as open and avowed enemies of the&s;e United States.</P>
<P>And further your Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, That the&s;e United States cannot, with propri|ty, hold any conference or treaty with <HI>any</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners on the part of Great Britain, unle&s;s they &s;hall, as a preli|minary thereto, either withdraw their fleets, and armies, or el&s;e, in po&s;itive and expre&s;s terms, acknowledge the Inde|pendence of the &s;aid States.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">And ina&s;much as it appears to be the de&s;ign of the ene|mies of the&s;e States to lull them into a fatal &s;ecurity &mdash;to the and that they may act with a becoming weight and im|portance, it is the opinion of your Committee that the &s;eve|ral States be called upon to u&s;e the mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions to have their re&s;pective quotas of continental troops in the field as &s;oon at po&s;&s;ible, and that all the militia of the &s;aid States be held in readine&s;s, to act as occa&s;ion may require.</P>

<P>I HAVE had the honor of laying your letter of the 3d in|&s;tant, with the acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, which come inclo&s;ed, before Congre&s;s; and I am in&s;tructed to ac|quaint you, Sir, that they have already expre&s;&s;ed their &s;enti|ments upon bills, not e&s;&s;entially different from tho&s;e acts, in a publication of the 22d of April la&s;t.</P>

<P><PB N="32" REF="31">THOUGH I am not &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the Abbe mi&s;takes in matters of hi&s;tory, acted at &s;o great a di&s;tance from his

<P><PB N="36" REF="35">FROM this part of the Abbe's work to the latter end, I find &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions, which appear to me to &s;tart,
<PB N="37" REF="36">with a cynical complexion, from the path of liberal think|ing, or at lea&s;t they are &s;o involved as to lo&s;e many of the beauties which di&s;tingui&s;h other parts of the perfor|mance.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">THE Abbe having brought his work to the period when the treaty of alliance between France and the Uni|ted States commenced, proceeds to make &s;ome remarks thereon.</P>
<P>"IN &s;hort," &s;ays he, <Q>philo&s;ophy who&s;e fir&s;t &s;enti|ment is the de&s;ire to &s;ee all governments ju&s;t and all people happy, in ca&s;ting her eyes upon this alliance of a monarchy, with a people who are defending their liberty, <HI>is curious to know its motive She fees at once, too clearly, that the happine&s;s of mankind has no part in it</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHATEVER train of thinking or of temper the Abbe might be in, when he penned this expre&s;&s;ion, matters not. They will neither qualify the &s;entiment, nor add to its defect. If right, it needs no apology; if wrong. it me|rits no excu&s;e. It is &s;ent into the world as an opinion of philo&s;ophy, and may be examined without regard to the author.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to be a defect, connected with ingenuity, that it often employs it&s;elf more in matters of curio&s;ity, than u&s;efulne&s;s. Man mu&s;t be the privy coun&s;ellor of fate, or &s;omething is not right. He mu&s;t know the &s;prings, the whys and wherefores of every thing, or he fits down un|&s;atisfied. Whether this be a crime, or only a caprice of humanity. I am not enquiring into. I &s;hall take the Pa&s;&s;age as I find it, and place my objections again&s;t it.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;o properly the <HI>motives</HI> which <HI>produced</HI> the alliance, as the <HI>con&s;equences</HI> which are to be <HI>produced from it,</HI> that mark out the field of philo&s;ophical reflection, In the one we only penetrate into the barren cave of &s;e|crecy, where little can be known, and every thing may be mi&s;conceived; in the other, the mind is pre&s;ented with a wide extended pro&s;pect of vegetative good, and &s;ees a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings budding into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT the expre&s;&s;ion, even within the compa&s;s of the Abbe's meaning, &s;ets out with an error, becau&s;e it is
<PB N="39" REF="38">made to declare that which no man has authority to de|clare. Who can &s;ay that the happine&s;s of mankind made <HI>no part of the motives</HI> which produced the alliance? To be able to declare this, a man mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mind of all the parties concerned, and know that their motives were &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the independence of America became contemplated and under&s;tood, the local advantages of it to the immediate actors, and the numerous benefits it promi&s;ed to mankind, appeared to be every day encrea|&s;ing; and we &s;aw not a temporary good for the pre&s;ent race only, but a continued good to all po&s;terity; the&s;e motives, therefore, added to tho&s;e which preceeded them, became the motives on the part of America, which led her to propo&s;e and agree to the treaty of alliance, as the be&s;t effectual method of extending and &s;ecuring happi|ne&s;s; and therefore with re&s;pect to us, the Abbe is wrong.</P>
<P>FRANCE. on the other hand, was &s;ituated very differ|ently to America. She was not acted upon by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;eek a friend, and therefore her motive in becoming one, has the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of being good, and that which is &s;o, mu&s;t have &s;ome happine&s;s for its object. With regard to her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aw a train of conveniences worthy her attention. By le&s;&s;ening the power of an enemy, whom, at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;ought neither to de&s;troy nor di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he gained an advantage without doing an evil, and created to her&s;elf a new friend by a&s;&s;ociating with a country in misfortune. The &s;prings of thought that led to actions of this kind, however political they may be, are neverthele&s;s naturally beneficient; for in all cau&s;es, good or bad it is nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be a fitne&s;s in the mind to enable it to act in character with the object: There|fore as a bad cau&s;e cannot be pro&s;ecuted with a good mo|tive, &s;o neither an a good cau&s;e be long &s;upported by a had one, and as no man acts without a motive, therefore in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, as they cannot be bad they mu&s;t be admitted to be good. But the Abbe &s;ets out upon &s;uch an extended &s;cale, that he overlooks the degrees by which it is mea&s;ured, and rejects the beginning of good, becau&s;e the end comes not at once.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">IT is true that bad motives may in &s;ome degree be brought to &s;upport a good cau&s;e or pro&s;ecute a good ob|ject; but it never continues long, which is not the ca&s;e with France; for either the object will reform the mind, or the mind corrupt the object, or el&s;e nor being able, ei|ther way, to get into uni&s;on, they will &s;eparate in di&s;gu&s;t: And this natural, though unperceived progre&s;s of a&s;&s;ocia|tion or contention between the mind and the object, is the &s;ecret cau&s;e of fidelity or defection. Every object a man pur&s;ues, is for the time, a kind of mi&s;tre&s;s to his mind: if both are good or bad, the union is natural; but if they are in rever&s;e, and neither can &s;educe nor yet reform the other, the oppo&s;ition grows into di&s;like and a &s;eparation fellows.</P>
<P>WHEN the cau&s;e of America fir&s;t made her appearance on the &s;tage of the univer&s;e, there were many, who, in the &s;tile of adventurers and fortune hunters, were dang|ling in her train, and making their court to her with every profe&s;&s;ion of honor and attachment. They were loud in her prai&s;e and o&s;tentations in her &s;ervice. Every place echoed with their ardor or their anger, and they &s;eemed like men in love. But, alas, they were fortune hunters. Their expectations were excited, but their minds were unimpre&s;&s;ed; and finding her not to their purpo&s;e, nor them&s;elves reformed by her influence, they cea&s;ed their &s;uit, and in &s;ome in&s;tances de&s;erted and betrayed her.</P>
<P>THERE were others, who at fir&s;t beheld her with in|difference, and unacquainted with her character were cau|tions of her company. They treated her as one, who, under the fair name of liberty, might conceal the hideous figure of anarchy, or the gloomy mon&s;ter of tyranny. They knew not what &s;he was. If fair, &s;he was fair in|deed. But &s;till &s;he was &s;u&s;pected, and though born a|mong us appeared to be a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>ACCIDENT with &s;ome, and curio&s;ity with others, bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on a di&s;tant acquaintance. They ventured to look at her. They felt an inclination to &s;peak to her. One intimacy led to another, till the &s;u&s;picion were away and a change
<PB N="41" REF="40">of &s;entiment &s;tole gradually upon the mind; and having no &s;elf-intere&s;t to &s;erve, no pa&s;&s;ion of di&s;honor to gratify, they became enamoured of her innocence, and unaltered by misfortune or uninflamed by &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hared with fide|lity in the varieties of her fate.</P>
<P>THIS declaration of the Abbe's, re&s;pecting motives, has led me unintendedly into a train of metaphy&s;ical rea|&s;oning; but there was no other avenue by which it could &s;o properly be approached. To place pre&s;umption a|gain&s;t pre&s;umption, a&s;&s;ertion again&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, is a mode of oppo&s;ition that has no effect; and therefore the more eligible method was to &s;hew, that the declaration does not corre&s;pond with the natural progre&s;s of the mind and the influence it has upon our conduct.&mdash;I &s;hall now quit this part and proceed to what I have before &s;tated, namely, that it is not &s;o properly the motives which produced the alliance, as the con&s;equences to be produced from it, that mark out the field of philo&s;ophical reflection.</P>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation I have already made in &s;ome former publication, that the circle of civilization is yet incom|plete. A mutuality of wants have formed the individu|als of each country into a kind of national &s;ociety, and here the progre&s;s of civilization has &s;topt. For it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that nations with regard to each other (notwith|&s;tanding the ideal civil law which every one explains as it &s;uits him) are like individuals in a &s;tate of nature. They are regulated by no fixt principle, governed by no compul&s;ive law, and each does independently what is plea&s;es or what it can.</P>
<P>WERE it po&s;&s;ible we could have known the world when in a &s;tate of barbari&s;m, we might have concluded that it never could be brought into the order we now &s;ee it. The untamed mind was then as hard, if not harder, to work upon in its individual &s;tate, than the national mind is in its pre&s;ent one. Yet we have &s;een the accompli&s;h|ment of the one, why then &s;hould we doubt that of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">THERE is a greater fitne&s;s in mankind to extend and compleat the civilization of nations with each other at this day&punc; than there was to begin it with the unconnected individuals at fir&s;t; in the &s;ame manner that it is &s;ome|what ea&s;ier to put together the materials of a machine after they are formed&punc; than it was to form them from ori|ginal matter. The pre&s;ent condition of the world dif|fering &s;o exceedingly from what it formerly was, has gi|ven a new ca&s;t to the mind of man, more than what he appears to be &s;en&s;ible of. The want of the individual, which fir&s;t produced the idea of &s;ociety, are now aug|mented into the wants of the nation, and he is obliged to &s;eek from another country what before he &s;ought from the next per&s;on.</P>
<P>LETTERS, the tongue of the world, have in &s;ome mea|&s;ure brought all mankind acquainted, and by an exten|&s;ion of their u&s;es are every day promoting &s;ome new friend&s;hip. Through them di&s;tant nations become capa|ble of conver&s;ation, and lo&s;ing by degrees the awkward|ne&s;s of &s;trangers, and the moro&s;ene&s;s of &s;u&s;picion, they learn to know and under&s;tand each other. Science, the parti&s;an of no country, but the beneficient patrone&s;s of all, has liberally opened a temple where all may meet. Her influence on the mind, like the &s;un on the chilled earth, has long been preparing it for higher cultivation and further improvement. The philo&s;opher of one coun|try &s;ees not an enemy in the philo&s;opher of another: He takes his &s;eat in the temple of &s;cience and a&s;ks not who &s;its be&s;ide him.</P>
<P>THIS was not the condition of the barbarian world. Then the wants of man were few, and the objects within his reach. While he could acquire the&s;e, he lived in a &s;tate of individual independence, the con&s;equence of which was, there were as many nations as per&s;ons, each contend|ing with the other, to &s;ecure &s;omething which he had, or to obtain &s;omething which he had not. The world had then no bu&s;ine&s;s to follow, no &s;tudies to exerci&s;e the mind. Their time was divided between &s;loth and fatigue. Hunt|ing and war were their chief occupations; &s;leep and food their principal enjoyments.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">Now it is otherwi&s;e. A change in the mode of life has made it nece&s;&s;ary to be bu&s;y; and man finds a thou|&s;and things to do now which before he did not. In&s;tead of placing his ideas of greatne&s;s in the rude atchieve|ments of the &s;avage, he &s;tudies arts, &s;cience, agriculture and commerce, the refinements of the gentleman, the principles of &s;ociety, and the knowledge of the philo&s;o|pher.</P>
<P>THERE are many things which in them&s;elves are mo|rally neither good nor bad, but they are productive of con&s;equences, which are &s;trongly marked with one or other of the&s;e characters. Thus commerce, though in it&s;elf a moral nullity, has had a con&s;iderable influence in tempering the human mind. It was the want of objects in the ancient world, which occa&s;ioned in them &s;uch a rude and perpetual turn for war. Their time hung on their hands without the means of employment. The in|dolence they lived in afforded lei&s;ure for mi&s;chief, and being all idle at once, and equal in their circum&s;tances, they were ea&s;ily provoked or induced to action.</P>
<P>BUT the introduction of commerce furni&s;hed the world with objects, which in their extent, reach every man and give him &s;omething to think about and &s;omething to do; by the&s;e his attention is mechanically drawn from the pur&s;uits, which a &s;tate of indolence and an unemployed mind occa&s;ioned, and he trades with the &s;ame countries, which former ages, tempted by their productions, and too indolent to purcha&s;e them, would have gone to war with.</P>
<P>THUS, as I have already ob&s;erved, the condition of the world being materially changed by the influence of &s;cience and commerce, it is put into a fitne&s;s not only to admit of, but to de&s;ire, an exten&s;ion of civilization. The principal and almo&s;t only remaining enemy it now has to encounter, is <HI>prejudice;</HI> for it is evidently the in|tere&s;t of mankind to agree and make the be&s;t of life. The world has undergone its divi&s;ions of empire, the &s;everal boundaries of which are known and &s;ettled. The idea
<PB N="44" REF="43">of conquering countries like the Greeks and Romans does not now exi&s;t; and experience has exploded the notion of going to war for the &s;ake of profit. In &s;hort, the ob|j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts for war are exceedingly dimini&s;hed, and there is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ft &s;carcely any thing to quarrel about, but what ari&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m that demon of &s;ociety, prejudice, and the con&s;e|quent &s;ullenne&s;s and untractablene&s;s of the temper.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething exceedingly curious in the con|&s;titution and operation of prejudice. It has the &s;ingular ability of accommodating it&s;elf to all the po&s;&s;ible varie|ties of the human mind. Some pa&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and vices are bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thinly &s;cattered among mankind, and find only here and there a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s of reception. But prejudice, like the &s;pider, makes every where his home. It has neither ta&s;te nor choice of place, and all that it requires is room. There is &s;carcely a &s;ituation except fire or water, in which a &s;pider will not live. So let the mind be as naked as the wills of an empty and for&s;aken tenement, gloomy as a dungeon, or ornamented with the riche&s;t abilities of think|ing, let it be hot, cold, dark or light, lonely or inhabited, &s;till prejudice, if undi&s;turbed, will fill it with cobwebs, and live, like the &s;pider, where there &s;eems nothing to live on. If the one prepares her food by poi&s;oning it to her palate and her u&s;e, the other does the &s;ame; and as &s;everal of our pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trongly charactered by the ani|mal world, prejudice may be denominated the &s;pider of the mind.</P>
<P>PERHAPS no two events ever united &s;o intimately and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rceab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to combat and expel prejudice, as the Revolu|tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of America and the Alliance with France. Their effects are felt, and their influence already extends as well to the old world as the new. Our &s;tile and manner of thinking have undergone a revolution, more extraordina|ry than the political revolution of the country. We &s;ee with other eyes; we hear with other ears; and think with other thoughts, than tho&s;e we formerly u&s;ed. We can look back on our own prejudices, as if they had been the prejudices of other people. We now &s;ee and know they were pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">judices and nothing el&s;e, and relieved from
<PB N="45" REF="44">their &s;hackles enjoy a freedom of mind, we felt not before. It was not all the argument, however powerful, nor all the rea&s;oning, however elegant, that could have produced this change, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the extention of the mind, and the cordiality of the world, without the two circum|&s;tances of the Revolution and the Alliance.</P>
<P>HAS America dropt quietly from Britain, no material change in &s;entiment, had taken place. The &s;ame notions, prejudices, and conceits, would have governed in both countries, as governed them before, and &s;till the &s;laves of error and education, they would have travelled on in the beaten track of vulgar and habitual thinking. But bro't about by the means it hath been, both with regard to our&s;elves to France, and to England, every corner of the mind is &s;wept of its cobwebs, poi&s;on, and du&s;t, and made fit for the reception of generous happine&s;s.</P>
<P>PERHAPS there never was an Alliance on a broader ba|&s;is, than that between America and France, and the pro|gre&s;s of it is worth attending to. The countries had been enemies, not properly of them&s;elves, but through the me|dium of England. They, originally, had no quarrel with each other, nor any cau&s;e for one, but what aro&s;e from the intere&s;t of England and her arming America again&s;t France. At the &s;ame time, the Americans at a di&s;tance from, and unacquainted with the world, and tutored in all the prejudices which governed tho&s;e who governed them conceived it their duty to act as they were taught. In doing this they expended their &s;ub&s;tance to make conque&s;ts, not for them&s;elves but for their ma&s;ters, who in return treated them as &s;laves.</P>
<P>A LONG &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of in&s;olent &s;everity, and the &s;epara|tion finally occa&s;ioned by the commencement of ho&s;tilities at Lexington, on the 19th of April, 1775, naturally pro|duced a new di&s;po&s;ition of thinking. As the mind clo&s;ed it&s;elf towards England it opened it&s;elf towards the world, and our prejudices like our oppre&s;&s;ions underwent though le&s;s ob&s;erved a mental examination; until we found the former as incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and benevolence, as the latter were repugnant to our civil and political rights.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">WHILE we were thus advancing by degrees into the wide field of extended humanity, the alliance with France was concluded. An alliance not formed for the meer purpo&s;e of a day, but on ju&s;t and generous grounds, and with equal and mutual advantages; and the ea&s;y affecti|onate manner in which the parties have &s;ince communica|ted, has made it an alliance not of courts only but of countries. There is now an union of mind as well as of intere&s;t; and our hearts as well as our pro&s;perity call on us to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>THE people of England not having experienced this change, had likewi&s;e no idea of it. They were hugging to their bo&s;oms the &s;ame prejudices we were trampling beneath our feet; and they expected to keep a hold upon America, by that narrowne&s;s of thinking, which America di&s;dained. What they were proud of, we de&s;pi&s;ed; and this is a principal cau&s;e why all their negociations, con|&s;tructed on this ground, have failed. We are now really another people, and cannot again go back to ignorance and prejudice. The mind once enlightened cannot a|gain become dark. There is no po&s;&s;ibility, neither is there any term to expre&s;s the &s;uppo&s;ition by, of the mind, unknowing any thing it already knows; and therefore all attempts on the part of England, fitted to the former habit of America, and on the expectation of their apply|ing now, will be like per&s;uading a &s;eeing man to become blind, and a &s;en&s;ible one to turn an idiot. The fir&s;t of which is unnatural, and the other impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As to the remark which the Abbe makes of the one country being a monarchy and the other a republic, it can have no e&s;&s;ential meaning. Forms of government have nothing to do with treaties. The former are the internal police of the countries &s;everally; the latter, their external policy jointly: and &s;o long as each per|forms its part, we have no more right or bu&s;ine&s;s to know how the one or the other conducts its dome&s;tic affairs, than we have to enquire into the private concerns of a family.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">BUT had the Abbe reflected for a moment, he would have &s;een, that courts or the governing powers of all countries, be their forms what they may, are relatively republics with each other. It is the fir&s;t and true prin|ciple of alliancing. Antiquity may have given prece|dence, and power will naturally create importance, but their equal right in never di&s;puted. It may likewi&s;e be worthy of remarking, that a monarchial country can &s;uf|fer nothing in its popular happine&s;s by allying with a re|publican one; and republican governments have never been de&s;troyed by their external connections, but by &s;ome internal convul&s;ion or contrivance. France has been in alliance with the republic of Swi&s;&s;erland for more than two hundred years, and &s;till Swi&s;&s;erland retains her origi|nal form as entire as if &s;he had allied with a republic like her&s;elf; therefore this remark of the Abbe goes to no|thing &mdash;Be&s;ides, it is be&s;t that mankind &s;hould mix. There is ever &s;omething to learn, either of manners or principle; and it is by a free communication, without regard to dome&s;tic matters, that friend&s;hip is to be ex|tended, and prejudice de&s;troyed all over the world.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the Abbe's high profe&s;&s;ions in fa|vor of liberty, he appears &s;ometimes to forget him&s;elf, or that his theory is rather the child of his fancy than of his judgment: For in almo&s;t the &s;ame in&s;tant that he cen|&s;ures the alliance as not originally or &s;ufficiently calcula|ted for the happine&s;s of mankind, he, by a figure of im|plication, accu&s;es France for having acted &s;o generou&s;ly and unre&s;ervedly in concluding it. <Q>Why did they (&s;ays he, meaning the Court of France) tie them&s;elves down by an incon&s;iderate treaty to conditions with the Con|gre&s;s, which they might them&s;elves have held in de|pendence by ample and regular &s;upplies.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN an author undertakes to treat of public happi|ne&s;s, he ought to be certain that he does not mi&s;take pa&s;|&s;ion for right, nor imagination for principle. Principle, like truth, needs no contrivance. It will ever tell its own tale, and tell it the &s;ame way. But where this is not the ca&s;e, every page mu&s;t be watched, recollected, and compared, like an invented &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">I AM &s;urpri&s;ed at this pa&s;&s;age of the Abbe. It means nothing or it means ill; and in any ca&s;e it &s;hews the great difference between &s;peculative and practical know|ledge. A treaty according to the Abbe's language would have neither duration nor affection; it might have la&s;ted to the end of the war, and then expired with it. But France, by acting in a &s;tile &s;uperior to the little polities of narrow thinking, has e&s;tabli&s;hed a generous fame and won the love of a country &s;he was before a &s;tranger to. She had to treat with a people who thought as nature taught them; and, on her own part, &s;he wi&s;ely &s;aw, there was no pre&s;ent advantage to be obtained by unequal terms, which could balance the more la&s;ting ones that might flow from a kind and generous beginning.</P>
<P>FROM this part the Abbe advances into the &s;ecret tran&s;actions of the two Cabinets of Ver&s;ailles and Madrid re&s;pecting the independence of America; through which I mean not to follow him. It is a circum&s;tance &s;ufficient|ly &s;triking without being commented on, that the former union of America with Britain produced a power, which in her hands, was becoming dangerous to the world And there is no improbability in &s;uppo&s;ing&punc; that had the latter known as much of the &s;trength of the former be|fore &s;he began the quarrel as &s;he has known fince, that in&s;tead of attempting to reduce her to unconditional &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;he would have propo&s;ed to her the conque&s;t of Mexico. But from the countries &s;eparately Spain has nothing to apprehend, though from their union &s;he had more to fear than any other power in Europe.</P>
<P>THE part which I &s;hall more particularly confine my|&s;elf to, is that wherein the Abbe takes an opportunity of complimenting the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try with high encomiums of admiration, on their rejecting the offered mediation of the court of Madrid, in 1779.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be remembered that before Spain joined France in the war, &s;he undertook the office of a mediator and made propo&s;als to the Briti&s;h King and Mini&s;try &s;o ex|ceedingly favourable to their intere&s;t, that had they been
<PB N="49" REF="48">accepted, would have become inconvenient, if not inad|mi&s;&s;ible, to America. The&s;e propo&s;als were neverthe|le&s;s rejected by the Briti&s;h cabinet; on which the Abbe &s;ays,&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>It is in &s;uch a circum&s;tance as this; it is in the time when noble pride clevates the &s;oul &s;uperior to all terror; when nothing is &s;een more dreadful than the &s;hame of receiving the law, and when there is no doubt or he&s;itation which to chu&s;e, between ruin and di&s;ho|nor; it is then, that the greatne&s;s of a nation is di&s;|played. I acknowledge however that men, accu&s;tom|ed to judge of things by the event, call great and pe|rilous re&s;olutions, heroi&s;m or madne&s;s, according to the good or bad &s;ucce&s;s with which they have been attend|ed. If then, I &s;hould be a&s;ked, what is the name which &s;hall in years to come be given to the firmne&s;s, which was in this moment exhibited by the Engli&s;h. I &s;hall an&s;wer that I do not know. But that which it de&s;erves I know. I know that the annals of the world hold out to us but rarely, the augu&s;t and maje&s;tic &s;pectacle of a nation, which chu&s;es rather to renounce its duration than its glory.</Q></P>
<P>IN this paragraph the conception is lofty and the ex|pre&s;&s;ion elegant; but the colouring is too high for the original, and the likene&s;s fails through an exce&s;s of graces. To fit the powers of thinking and the turn of language to the &s;ubject, &s;o as to bring out a clear conclu&s;ion that &s;hall hit the point in que&s;tion and nothing el&s;e, is the true criterion of writing. But the greater part of the Abbe's writings (if he will pardon me the remark) appear to me uncentral and burthen&s;ome with variety. They repre|&s;ent a beautiful wilderne&s;s without paths; in which the eye in diverted by every thing, without being particular|ly directed to any thing; and in which it is agreeable to be lo&s;t, and difficult to find the way out.</P>
<P>BEFORE I offer any other remark on the &s;pirit and compo&s;ition of the above pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall compare it with the circum&s;tance it alludes to.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49">THE circum&s;tance then does not de&s;erve the encomi|um. The rejection was not prompted by her fortitude but her vanity She did not view it as a ca&s;e of de&s;pair or even of extreme danger, and con&s;equently the deter|mination to renounce her duration rather than her glory, cannot apply to the condition of her mind. She had then high expectations of &s;ubjugating America, and had no other naval force again&s;t her than France; neither was &s;he certain that rejecting the mediation of Spain would combine that power with France. New mediations might ari&s;e more favorable than the&s;e &s;he had refu&s;ed. But if they &s;hould not, and Spain &s;hould join, &s;he &s;till &s;aw that it would only bring out her naval force again&s;t France and Spain, which was not wanted and could not be employed again&s;t America, and habits of thinking had taught her to believe her&s;elf &s;uperior to both.</P>
<P>BUT in any ca&s;e to which the con&s;equence might point, there was nothing to impre&s;s her with the idea of renoun|cing her duration. It is not the policy of Europe to &s;uf|fer the extinction of any power, but only to lop off or pre|vent its dangerous enerea&s;e. She was likewi&s;e freed by &s;ituation from the internal and immediate horrors of in|va&s;ion; was rolling in di&s;&s;ipation and looking for con|que&s;ts; and tho' &s;he &s;uffered nothing but the expence of war, &s;he &s;till had a greedy eye to magnificent reimbur&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>BUT if the Abbe is delighted with high and &s;triking &s;ingularities of character, he might, in America, have &s;ound ample field for encomium. Here was a people, who could not know what part the world would take for, or again&s;t them; and who were venturing on an untried &s;cheme, in oppo&s;ition to a power, again&s;t which more for|midable nations had failed. They had every thing to learn but the principles which &s;upported them, and every thing to precure that was nece&s;&s;ary for their defence. They have at times &s;een them&s;elves as low as di&s;tre&s;s could make them, without &s;howing the lea&s;t &s;tagger in their fortitude; and been rai&s;ed again by the mo&s;t unex|pected events, without di&s;covering an unmanly di&s;compo|&s;ure
<PB N="51" REF="50">of joy. To he&s;itate or to de&s;pair are conditions e|qually unknown in America. Her mind was prepared for every thing; becau&s;e her original and final re&s;olution of &s;ucceeding or peri&s;hing included all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE rejection of the Briti&s;h propo&s;itions in the year 1778, circum&s;tanced as America was at that time, is a far greater in&s;tance of un&s;haken fortitude than the refu&s;al of the Spani&s;h mediation by the Court of London: And o|ther hi&s;torians, be&s;ides the Abbe, &s;truck with the va&s;tne&s;s of her conduct therein, have, like him&s;elf, attributed it to a circum&s;tance, which was then unknown, the alliance with France. Their error &s;hews their idea of its great|ne&s;s; becau&s;e, in order to account for it, they have &s;ought a cau&s;e &s;uited to its magnitude, without knowing that the cau&s;e exi&s;ted in the principles of the country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>BUT this pa&s;&s;ionate encomium of the Abbe is de&s;erved|ly &s;ubject to moral and philo&s;ophical objections. It is the effu&s;ion of wild thinking, and has a tendency to prevent that humanity of reflection which the criminal conduct of Britain enjoins on her as a duty.&mdash;It is a laudanum to courtly iniquity.&mdash;It keeps in intoxicated &s;leep the con|&s;cience of a nation: and more mi&s;chief in effected by
<PB N="52" REF="51">wrapping up guilt in &s;plendid excu&s;e, than by directly pa|tronizing it.</P>
<P>BRITAIN is now the only country which holds the world in di&s;turbance and war; and in&s;tead of paying compliments to the exce&s;s of her crimes, the Abbe would have appeared much more in character, had he put to her, or to her monarch, this &s;erious que&s;tion&mdash;</P>
<P>ARE there not mi&s;eries enough in the world, too diffi|cult to be encountered and too pointed to be borne, with|out &s;tudying to enlarge the li&s;t and arming it with new de&s;truction? Is life &s;o very long, that it is nece&s;&s;ary, nay even a duty to &s;hake the &s;and and ha&s;ten out the period of duration? Is the path &s;o elegantly &s;mooth, &s;o decked on every &s;ide and carpeted with joys, that wretchedne&s;s is wanted to enrich it as a foil? Go a&s;k thine aching heart when &s;orrow from a thou&s;and cau&s;es wound it, go a&s;k thy &s;ickened &s;elf when every medicine fails, whether this be the ca&s;e or not?</P>
<P>QUITTING my remarks on this head, I proceed to ano|ther in which the Abbe has let loo&s;e a vein of ill nature, and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>AFTER cavilling at the treaty, he goes on to character|ize the &s;everal parties combined in the war&mdash;"Is it po&s;|&s;ible," &s;ays the Abbe, <Q>that a &s;trict union &s;hould long &s;ub&s;i&s;t among confederates of characters &s;o oppo&s;ite as the ha&s;ty, light, di&s;tainful Frenchman, the jealous, haughty &s;ly, &s;low, circum&s;pective Spaniard, and the American, who is &s;ecretly &s;natching looks at the mo|ther country, and would rejoice, were they compatible with his independence, at the di&s;a&s;ters of his allies.</Q></P>
<P>TO draw fooli&s;h portraits of each other, is a mode of attack and repri&s;al, which the greater part of mankind are fond of indulging. The &s;erious philo&s;opher &s;hould be above it, more e&s;pecially in ca&s;es from which no po&s;&s;i|ble good can ari&s;e, and mi&s;chief may, and where no re|ceived provocation can palliate the offence.&mdash;The Abbe
<PB N="53" REF="52">might have invented a difference of character for every country in the world; and they in return might find o|thers for him, till in the war of wit all real character is lo&s;t. The plea&s;antry of one nation or the gravity of another may, by a little penciling, be di&s;torted into whim|&s;ical features, and the painter become as much laugh|ed at as the painting.</P>
<P>BUT why did not the Abbe look a little deeper and bring forth the excellencies of the &s;everal parties. Why did he not dwell with plea&s;ure on that greatne&s;s of cha|racter, that &s;uperiority of heart, which has marked the conduct of France in her conque&s;ts, and which has forced an acknowledgment even from Britain.</P>
<P>THERE is one line at lea&s;t (and many others might be di&s;covered) in which the confederates unite, which is, that of a rival eminence in their treatment of their ene|mies. Spain, in her conque&s;t of Minorca and the Baha|ma i&s;lands confirms this remark. America has been in|variably in her lenity from the beginning of the war, not|with&s;tanding the high provocations &s;he has experienced. It is England only who has been in&s;olent and cruel.</P>
<P>BUT why mu&s;t America be charged with a crime un|de&s;erved by her conduct, more &s;o by her principles, and which, if a fact, would be fatal to her honor. I mean that of want of attachment to her allies, or rejoicing in their di&s;a&s;ters She, it is true, has been a&s;&s;iduous in &s;hew|ing to the world that &s;he was not the aggre&s;&s;or towards England, that the quarrel was not of her &s;eeking, or, at that time, even of her wi&s;hing. But to draw inferences from her candor, and even from her ju&s;tification, to &s;tab her character by, and I &s;ee nothing el&s;e from which they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be drawn, is unkind and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>DOES her rejection of the Briti&s;h propo&s;itions in 1778, before &s;he knew of any alliance with France, corre&s;pond with the Abbe's de&s;cription of her mind? Does a &s;ingle in&s;tance of her conduct &s;ince that time ju&s;tify it?&mdash;But there is a &s;till better evidence to apply to, which is, that
<PB N="54" REF="53">of all the mails, which at different times have been way|laid on the road, in divers parts of America, and taken and carried into New York, and from which the mo&s;t &s;e|cret and confidential private letters, as well as tho&s;e from authority, have been publi&s;hed, not one of them, I repeat it, not a &s;ingle one of them, gives countenance to &s;uch a charge.</P>
<P>THIS is not a country where men are under govern|ment re&s;traint in &s;peaking; and if there is any kind of re&s;traint, it ari&s;es from a fear of popular re&s;entment. Now, if nothing in her private or public corre&s;pondence favours &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion, and if the general di&s;po&s;ition of the country is &s;uch as to make it un&s;afe for a man to &s;hew an appearance of joy at any di&s;a&s;ter to her ally, on what grounds, I a&s;k, can the accu&s;ation &s;tand. What company the Abbe may have kept in France, we cannot know; but this we know, that the account he gives does not apply to America.</P>
<P>HAD the Abbe been in America at the time the news arrived of the di&s;a&s;ter of the fleet under Count de Gra&s;&s;e, in the We&s;t Indies, he would have &s;een his va&s;t mi&s;take. Neither do I remember any in&s;tance, except the lo&s;s of Charle&s;town, in which the public mind &s;uffered more &s;e|vere and pungent concern, or underwent more agitations of hope and apprehen&s;ion as to the truth or fal&s;hood of the report. Had the lo&s;s been all our own it could not have had a deeper effect, yet it was not one of the&s;e ca&s;es which reached to the independence of America.</P>
<P>IN the geographical account which the Abbe gives of the Thirteen States, he is &s;o exceedingly erroneous, that to attempt a particular refutation, would exceed the li|mits I have pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf. And as it is a matter neither political, hi&s;torical, nor &s;entimental, and which can always be contradicted by the extent and natural cir|cum&s;tances of the country, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over; with this additional remark, that I never yet &s;aw an European de|&s;cription of America that was true, neither can any per|&s;on gain a ju&s;t idea of it, but by coming to it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54">THOUGH I have already extended this letter beyond what I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, I am, neverthele&s;s, obliged to omit many ob&s;ervations I originally de&s;igned to have made.

But the wrong ideas which the Abbe's work had a ten|dency to excite, and the prejudicial impre&s;&s;ions they might make, mu&s;t be an apology for my remarks, and the free|dom with which they are done.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE the Abbe has made a &s;ort of epitome of a con&s;iderable part of the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> and in|troduced it in that form into his publication.

<P>THIS truth is, that the Briti&s;h had formed a very hum|ble opinion of the Dutch nation. They looked on them as a people who would &s;ubmit to any thing; that they might in&s;ult them as they liked, plunder them at they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and &s;till the Dutch dated not to be provoked.</P>
<P>IF this be taken as the opinion of the Briti&s;h cabinet, the mea&s;ure it ea&s;ily accounted for; becau&s;e it goes on the &s;uppo&s;ition that when, by a declaration of ho&s;tilities, the had rubbed the Dutch of &s;ome millions &s;terling (and to rob them was popular) they could make peace with them again whenever they plea&s;ed and on almo&s;t any terms the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try &s;hould propo&s;e. And no &s;ooner was
<PB N="59" REF="58">the plundering committed, than the accommodation was &s;et on foot, and failed.</P>
<P>WHEN once the mind lo&s;es the &s;en&s;e of its own digni|ty, it lo&s;es, likewi&s;e, the ability of judging of it in ano|ther. And the American war has throw Britain into &s;uch a variety of ab&s;urd &s;ituations that arguing from her|&s;elf, &s;he &s;ees not in what conduct national dignity con|&s;i&s;ts in other countries. From Holland &s;he expected du|plicity and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and this mi&s;take aro&s;e from her having acted, in a number of in&s;tances during the pre&s;ent war, the &s;ame character her&s;elf.</P>
<P>To be allied to, or connected with Britain, &s;eems to be an un&s;afe and impolitic &s;ituation. Holland and Ame|rica are in&s;tances of the reality of this remark. Make tho&s;e countries the allies of France or Spain, and Britain will court them with civility, and treat them with re|&s;pect; make them her own allies, and &s;he will in&s;ult and plunder them In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, &s;he feels &s;ome appre|hen&s;ions at offending them, becau&s;e they have &s;upport at hand; in the latter, tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions do not exi&s;t. Such, however, has hitherto been her conduct.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mea&s;ure which has taken place &s;ince the pub|lication of the Abbe's work, and likewi&s;e &s;ince the time of my beginning this letter, is the change in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. What line the new cabinet will pur&s;ue re&s;pect|ing America, is at this time unknown; neither is it very material, unle&s;s they are &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to a general and honorable peace.</P>
<P>REPEATED experience has &s;hewn, not only the imprac|ticability of conquering America, but the &s;till higher im|po&s;&s;ibility of conquering her mind, or recalling her back to her former condition of thinking. Since the commence|ment of the war, which is now approaching to eight years, thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands have advanced and are daily advancing into the fir&s;t &s;tage of manhood, who know nothing of Britain but as a barbarous enemy, and to whom the independence of America appears as much the natural and e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the country, as that of England does to an Engli&s;hman And on the other hand, thou&s;ands of the aged, who had Briti&s;h ideas, have
<PB N="60" REF="59">dropped, and are daily dropping, from the &s;tage of bu&s;i|ne&s;s and life. The natural progre&s;s of generation and decay operates every hour to the di&s;advantage of Britain. Time and death, hard enemies to contend with, fight con&s;tantly again&s;t her intere&s;t; and the bills of mortality in every part of America, are the thermometers of her decline. The children in the &s;treets are from their cradle bred to con&s;ider her as their only foe. They hear of her cruellies; of their fathers, uncles, and kindred killed; they &s;ee the remains of burnt and de&s;troyed hou&s;es, and the common tradition of the &s;chool they go to, tells them, <HI>tho&s;e things were done by the Briti&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are circum&s;tances which the mere Engli&s;h &s;tate politician, who con&s;iders man only in a &s;tate of manhood, does not attend to. He gets entangled with parties co|eval or equal with him&s;elf at home, and thinks not how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing generation in America is growing beyond his knowledge of them, or they of him.

<P>THE new Briti&s;h admini&s;tration is compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve ever been again&s;t the war, and who have con|&s;tantly reprobated all the violent mea&s;ures of the former one.

She has nothing to do with Engli&s;h parties. The ins and the outs are nothing to her It is the whole country &s;he is at war with, or mu&s;t be at peace with.</P>
<P>WERE every Mini&s;ter in England a <HI>Chatham</HI> it would now weigh little or nothing in the &s;cale of American politics. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has pre&s;erved to the memory of this &s;tate&s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame</HI> which he, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iving would have lo&s;t.

<P><PB N="61" REF="60">IT has apparently been the fault of many in the late minority, to &s;uppo&s;e, that America would agree to certain terms with them, were they in place, which &s;he would not ever li&s;ten to from the then Admini&s;tration. This idea can an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than to prolong the war; and Britain may, at the expence of many more mil|lions, learn the fatality of &s;uch mi&s;takes. If the new mi|ni&s;try wi&s;ely avoid this hopele&s;s policy, they will prove them&s;elves better pilots, and wi&s;er men, than they are conceived to be; for it is every day expected to &s;ee their bark &s;trike upon &s;ome hidden rock and go to pieces.</P>
<P>BUT there is a line in which they may be great. A more brilliant opening needs not to pre&s;ent it&s;elf; and it is &s;uch a one, as true magnanimity would improve, and humanity rejoice in.</P>
<P>A TOTAL reformation is wanted in England. She wants an expanded mind.&mdash;an heart which embraces the uni|ver&s;e. In&s;tead of &s;hutting her&s;elf up in an i&s;land, and quarrelling with the world&punc; &s;he would derive more la&s;ting happine&s;s, and acquire more real riches, by generou&s;ly mixing with it, and bravely &s;aying, I am the enemy of none. It is not now a time for little contrivances or art|ful politics. The European world is too experienced to be impo&s;ed upon, and America too wi&s;e to be duped. It mu&s;t be &s;omething new and ma&s;terly that mu&s;t &s;ucceed. The idea of &s;educing America from her independence, or corrupting her from her alliance, is a thought too little for a great mind, and impo&s;&s;ible for any hone&s;t one, to attempt Whenever politics are applied to debauch man|kind from their integrity, and di&s;&s;olve the virtues of hu|man nature, they become dete&s;table; and to be a &s;tate&s;|man upon this plan, is to be a commi&s;&s;ioned villain. He who aims at it leaves a vacancy in his character, which may be filled up with the wor&s;t of epithets.</P>
<P>In the di&s;po&s;ition of England &s;hould be &s;uch, as not to agree to a general and honorable place, and that the war mu&s;t, at all events, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ger, I cannot help wi&s;h|ing, that the allia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which America has or may enter into, may become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts of the war.

<P>BUT where is the impo&s;&s;ibility or even the great diffi|culty of England forming a friend&s;hip with France and Spain, and making it a national virtue to renounce for ever tho&s;e prejudiced inveteracies it has been her cu&s;tom to cheri&s;h; and which, while they &s;erve to &s;ink her with an encrea&s;ing enormity of debt, by involving her in fruit|le&s;s wars, become likewi&s;e the bane of her repo&s;e, and the de&s;truction of her manners. We had once the fetters that &s;he has now, but experience has &s;hewn us the mi&s;take, and thinking ju&s;tly has &s;et us right.</P>
<P>THE true idea of a great nation is that which extends and promotes the principles of univer&s;al &s;ociety. Whole mind ri&s;es above the atmo&s;pheres of local thoughts, and con&s;iders mankind, of whatever nation or profe&s;&s;ion they may be, as the work of one Creator. The rage for con|que&s;t has had its fa&s;hion, and its day. Why may not the amiable virtues have the &s;ame? The Alexanders and Cae|&s;ars of antiquity have left behind them their monuments of de&s;truction, and are remembered with hatred; while the&s;e more exalted characters, who fir&s;t taught &s;ociety and &s;cience, are ble&s;t with the gratitude of every age &amp; country. Of more u&s;e was <HI>one</HI> philo&s;opher, though a heathen, to the world, than all the heathen conquerors that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>SHOULD the pre&s;ent revolution be di&s;tingui&s;hed by o|pening a new &s;y&s;tem of extended civilization, it will receive from heaven the highe&s;t evidence of approbation; and as this is a &s;ubject to which the Abbe's powers are &s;o emi|nently &s;uited, I recommend it to his attention, with the affection of a friend, and the ardor of a univer&s;al citizen.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT</HEAD>
<P>SINCE clo&s;ing the foregoing letter, &s;ome intimations, re&s;pecting a general peace, have made their way to America On what authority or foundation they &s;tand, or how near or remote &s;uch an event may be, are circum&s;tances I am not inquiring into But as the &s;ub|ject mu&s;t &s;ooner or later become a matter of &s;erious atten|tion, it may not be improper, even at this early period, candidly to inve&s;tigate &s;ome points that are connected with it, or lead towards it.</P>
<P>THE independence of America is at this moment as firm|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed as that of any other country in a &s;tate of war. It is not length of time, but power that gives &s;tability. Nations at war know nothing of each other on the &s;core of antiquity. It is their pre&s;ent and immediate &s;trength, together with their connections, that mu&s;t &s;upport them. To which we may add, that a right which originated to|day&punc; is as much a right, as if it had the &s;anction of a thou&s;and years; and therefore the independence and pre&s;ent governments of America are in no more danger of being &s;ubverted, becau&s;e they are modern, than that of England is &s;ecure, becau&s;e it is ancient.</P>
<P>THE polities of Britain, &s;o far as they re&s;pected Ame|rica, were originally conceived in idiotism, and acted in madne&s;s. There is not a &s;tep which bears the &s;malle&s;t trace of rationality. In her management of the war, &s;he has laboured to be wretched, and &s;tudied to be hated; and in all her former propo&s;itions for accommodation, &s;he has di&s;covered a total ignorance of mankind, and of tho&s;e natural and unalterable &s;en&s;ations by which they are &s;o generally governed. How &s;he may conduct her|&s;elf in the pre&s;ent or future bu&s;ine&s;s of negociating a peace is yet to be proved.</P>
<P>HE is a weak politician who does not under&s;tand human nature, and penetrate into the effect which mea&s;ures of government will have upon the mind. All the mi&s;carria|ges
<PB N="64" REF="63">of Britain have ari&s;en from this defect. The former Mini&s;try acted as if they &s;uppo&s;ed mankind to be <HI>without a mind;</HI> and the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, as if America was <HI>without a memory.</HI> The one mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed we were incapable of feeling; and the other, that we could not remember injuries.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e another line in which politicians mi&s;take, which is that of not rightly calculating, or rather of mi&s;judging&punc; the con&s;equence which any given circum|&s;tance will produce. Nothing is more frequent as well in common as in political life than to hear people complain, that &s;uch or &s;uch means produced an event directly con|trary to their intentions. But the fault lies in their not judging rightly, what the event would be: for the means produced only its proper and natural con&s;equence.</P>
<P>IT is very probable, that in a treaty for peace, Britain will contend for &s;ome po&s;t or other in North-America; perhaps Canada or Halifax or both: And I infer this from the known deficiency of her politics, which have e|ver yet made u&s;e of means, who&s;e natural event was a|gain&s;t both her intere&s;t and her expectation. But the que&s;tion with her ought to be, whether it is worth her while to hold them, and what will be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>RESPECTING Canada, one or other of the two follow|ing will take place, viz If Canada &s;hould people, it will revolt; and if it do not people&punc; it will not be worth the expence of holding. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of Hali|fax, and the country round it. But Canada <HI>never will</HI> people; neither is there any occa&s;ion for contrivances on one &s;ide or the other, for nature alone will do the whole,</P>
<P>BRITAIN may put her&s;elf to great expences in &s;ending &s;ettlers to Canada; but the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e &s;ettlers will be Americans, as other de&s;cendants have been before them. They will look round and &s;ee the neighbouring States &s;overeign and free, re&s;pected abroad and trading at large with the world; and the natural love of liberty, the advantages of commerce, the ble&s;&s;ings of independence
<PB N="65" REF="64">and of a happier climate, and a richer &s;oil, will draw them &s;outhward, and the effect will be that Britain will &s;u&s;tain the expence, and America reap the advantage.</P>
<P>ONE would think that the experience which Britain has had of America, would entirely &s;icken her of all thoughts of continental colonization; and any part which &s;he might retain, will only become to her a field of jealou&s;y and thorns, of debate and contention, for ever &s;truggling for privileges, and meditating revolt. She may form new &s;ettlements, but they will be for us; they will become part of the United States of America; and that again&s;t all her contrivances to prevent it, or without any endea|vours of ours to promote it. In the fir&s;t place &s;he can|not draw from them a revenue, until they are able to pay one, and when they are &s;o, they will be above &s;ubjec|tion. Men &s;oon become attached to the &s;oil they live upon, and incorporated with the pro&s;perity of the place; and it &s;ignifies but little what opinions they come over with, for time, intere&s;t, and new connections will render them ob&s;olete, and the next generation know nothing of them.</P>
<P>WERE Britain truly wi&s;e, &s;he would lay hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity to di&s;entangle her&s;elf from all conti|nental embarra&s;&s;ments in North-America, and that not on|ly to avoid future broils and troubles, but to &s;ave expen|ces. For to &s;peak explicitly on the matter, I would not, were I an European power, have Canada, under the con|ditions that Britain mu&s;t retain it&punc; could it be given to me. It is one of tho&s;e kind of dominions that is&punc; and ever will be, a con&s;tant charge upon any foreign holder.</P>
<P>AS to Halifax, it will become u&s;ele&s;s to England after the pre&s;ent war, and the lo&s;s of the United States. A harbour, when the dominion is gone, for the purpo&s;e of which only it was wanted, can be attended only with ex|pence. There are, I doubt not, thou&s;ands of people in England, who &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e places are a profit to the nation whereas they are directly the contrary and in&s;tead of producing any revenue, a con&s;iderable part of
<PB N="66" REF="65">the revenue of England is annually drawn off, to &s;upport the expence of holding them.</P>
<P>GIBRALTAR is another in&s;tance of national ill policy. A po&s;t which in time of peace is not wanted, and in time of war is of no u&s;e, mu&s;t at all times be u&s;ele&s;s. In&s;tead of affording protection to a navy, it requires the aid of one to maintain it. And to &s;uppo&s;e that Gibraltar commands the Mediterranean, or the pa&s;s into it, or the trade of it, is to &s;uppo&s;e a detected fal&s;hood; becau&s;e though Britain holds the po&s;t &s;he has lo&s;t the other three, and every be|nefit &s;he expected from it. And to &s;ay that all this hap|pens becau&s;e it is be&s;ieged by land and water, is to &s;ay nothing&punc; for this will always be the ca&s;e in time of war, while France and Spain keep up &s;uperior fleets, and Bri|tain holds the place.&mdash;So that, though as an impenetra|ble inacce&s;&s;ible rock it may be held by the one, it is al|ways in the power of the other to render it u&s;ele&s;s and exce&s;&s;ively chargeable.</P>
<P>I SHOULD &s;uppo&s;e that on e of the principal objects of Spain in be&s;ieging it, is to &s;hew to Britain, that though &s;he may not take it, &s;he can command it, that is, &s;he can &s;hut it up, and prevent its being u&s;ed as a harbour, tho' not a garri&s;on.&mdash;But the &s;hort way to reduce Gibraltar, is, to attack the Briti&s;h fleet; for Gibraltar is as depen|dent on a fleet for &s;upport, as a bird is on its wing for food, and when wounded there it &s;tarves.</P>
<P>THERE is another circum&s;tance which the people of England have not only not attended to, but &s;eem to be utterly ignorant of, and that is, the difference between permanent power, and accidental power, con&s;idered in a national &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>BY permanent power, I mean, a natural inherent and perpetual ability in a nation, which though always in being, may not be always in action, or not always advan|tageou&s;ly directed; and by accidental power, I mean, a fortunate or accidental di&s;po&s;ition or exerci&s;e of national &s;trength, in whole or in part.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="66">THERE undoubtedly was a time when any one Euro|pean nation, with only eight or ten &s;hips of war, equal to the pre&s;ent &s;hips of the line, could have carried terror to all others, who had not began to build a navy, however great their natural ability might be for that purpo&s;e: But this can be con&s;idered only as accidental, and not as a &s;tand to compare permanent power by, and could la&s;t no longer than until tho&s;e powers built as many or more &s;hips than the former. After this a larger fleet was nece&s;&s;ary in order to be &s;uperior; and a &s;till larger would again &s;uper&s;ede it. And thus mankind have gone on building fleet upon fleet, as occa&s;ion or &s;ituation dictated. And this reduces it to an original que&s;tion, which is: Which power can build and man the large&s;t number of &s;hips? The natural an&s;wer to which is, That power which has the large&s;t revenue and the greate&s;t number of inhabi|tants, provided its &s;ituation of coa&s;t affords &s;ufficient con|veniencies.</P>
<P>FRANCE being a nation on the continent of Europe, and Britain an i&s;land in its neighbourhood, each of them derived different ideas from their different &s;ituations. The inhabitants of Britain could earry on no foreign trade, nor &s;tir from the &s;pot they dwelt upon, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of &s;hipping; but this was not the ca&s;e with France. The idea therefore of a navy did not ari&s;e to France from the &s;ame original and immediate nece&s;&s;ity which produced it to England. But the que&s;tion is, that when both of them turn their attention, and employ their reve|nues the &s;ame way, which can be &s;uperior?</P>
<P>THE annual revenue of France is nearly double that of England, and her number of inhabitants more than twice as many. Each of them has the &s;ame length of coa&s;t on the channel, be&s;ides which. France has &s;everal hundred miles extent on the bay of Bi&s;cay, and an open|ing on the Mediterranean: And every day proves that practice and exerci&s;e make &s;ailors as well as &s;oldiers in one country as well as another.</P>
<P>IT then Britain can maintain an hundred &s;hips of the
<PB N="68" REF="67">line, France can as well &s;upport an hundred and fifty, becau&s;e her revenues and her population are as equal to the one, as tho&s;e of England are to the other. And the only rea&s;on why &s;he has not done it, is becau&s;e &s;he has not till very lately attended to it. But when &s;he &s;ees, as &s;he now &s;ees, that a navy is the fir&s;t engine of power, &s;he can ea&s;ily accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>ENGLAND very fal&s;ely, and ruinou&s;ly for her&s;elf, infer, that becau&s;e &s;he had the advantage of France, while France had the &s;maller navy, that for that rea&s;on it is al|ways to be &s;o. Whereas it may be clearly &s;een, that the &s;trength of France has never yet been tried on a navy, and that &s;he is able to be as &s;uperior to England in the extent of navy, as &s;he is in the extent of her revenues and her population. And England may lament the day, when, by her in&s;olence and inju&s;tice, &s;he provoked in France a maritime di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>IT is in the power of the combined fleets to conquer every i&s;land in the We&s;t Indies, and reduce all the Briti&s;h navy in tho&s;e places. For were France and Spain to &s;end their whole naval force in Europe to tho&s;e i&s;lands, it would not be in the power of Britain to follow them with an equal force. She would &s;till be twenty or thirty &s;hips inferior, were &s;he to &s;end every ve&s;&s;el &s;he had, and in the mean time all the foreign trade of England would lay expo&s;ed to the Dutch.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim, which, I am per&s;uaded, will ever hold good, and more e&s;pecially in naval operations, that a great power ought never to move in detachments, if it can po&s;&s;ibly be avoided But to go with its whole force to &s;ome important object, the reduction of which &s;hall have a deci&s;ive effect upon the war. Had the whole of the French and Spani&s;h fleets in Europe come la&s;t &s;pring to the We&s;t-Indies, every i&s;land had been their own, Rod|ney their pri&s;oner, and his fleet their prize. From the United States the combined fleets can be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, without the nece&s;&s;ity of drawing them from Europe, which is not the ca&s;e with England.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">ACCIDENT has thrown &s;ome advantages in the way of England, which, from the inferiority of her navy, &s;he had not a right to expect For though &s;he has been obli|ged to fly before the combined fleets, yet Rodney has twice had the fortune to fall in with detached &s;quadrons, to which he was &s;uperior in numbers: The fir&s;t off Cape St Vincent, where he had nearly two to one, and the other in the We&s;t Indies, where he had a majority of &s;ix &s;hips. Victories of this kind almo&s;t produce them&s;elves. They are won without honor, and &s;uffered without di&s;|grace: And are a&s;cribable to the chance of meeting not to the &s;uperiority of fighting. For the &s;ame Admiral, under whom they were obtained, was unable, in three former engagements, to make the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on a fleet con&s;i&s;ting of an equal number of &s;hips with his own, and compounded for the events by declining the actions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the accounte, either Engli&s;h or French of three actions in the We&s;t Indies, between Count de Guichen and Admiral Rodney, in <HI>1780.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>To conclude, if it may be &s;aid that Britain has nume|rous enemies, it likewi&s;e proves that &s;he has given nume|rous offences. In&s;olence is &s;ure to provoke hatred, whe|ther in a nation or an individual. The want of manners in the Briti&s;h Court may be &s;een even in its birth days and new years Odes, which are calculated to infatuate the vulgar, and di&s;gu&s;t the man of refinement: And her for|mer overbearing rudene&s;s, and in&s;ufferable inju&s;tice on the &s;eas, have made every commercial nation her foe. Her fleets were employed as engines of prey; and acted on the &s;urface of the deep the character which the &s;hark does beneath it.&mdash;On the other hand, the Combined Powers are taking a popular part, and will render their reputa|tion immortal, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the perfect freedom of the ocean, to which all countries have a right, and are inte|re&s;ted in accompli&s;hing. The &s;ea is the world's high|way; and he who arrogates a prerogative over it, tran&s;|gre&s;&s;es the right, and ju&s;tly brings on him&s;elf the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="69">PERHAPS it might be of &s;ome &s;ervice to the future tranquility of mankind, were an article introduced into the next general peace, that no one nation &s;hould, in time of peace, exceed a certain number of &s;hips of war. &s;ome|thing of this kind &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary; for according to the prefent fa&s;hion, half the world will get upon the water, and there appears no end to the extent to which navies may be carried. Another rea&s;on is, that navies add no|thing to the manners or morals of a people. The &s;eque&s;|tered life which attends the &s;ervice, prevents the oppor|tunities of &s;ociety, and is too apt to occa&s;ion a coar&s;ene&s;s of ideas and language, and that more in &s;hips of war than in commercial employ; becau&s;e in the latter they mir more with the world, and are nearer related to it. I men|tion this remark as a general one; and not applied to any one country more than to another.</P>
<P>BRITAIN has now had the trial of above &s;even years, with an expence of nearly an hundred million pounds &s;terling; and every month in which &s;he delays to conclude a peace, co&s;ts her another million &s;terling, over and above her ordinary expences of government, which are a million more; &s;o that her total <HI>monthly</HI> expence is two million pounds &s;terling, which is equal to the whole <HI>yearly</HI> expence of America, all charges included. Judge then who is be&s;t able to continue it.</P>
<P>SHE has likewi&s;e many atonements to make to an in|jured world as well in one quarter as another. And in|&s;tead of pur&s;uing that temper of arrogance, which &s;erves only to &s;ink her in the e&s;teem, and entail on her the di&s;|like, of all nations, &s;he would do well to reform her man|ners retrench her expences, live peaceably with her neigh|bours, and think of war no more.</P>
