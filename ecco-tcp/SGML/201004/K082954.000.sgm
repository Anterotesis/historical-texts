<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE defects of our &s;y&s;tem of poor laws have lately engaged the attention of the public; and a variety of eminent writers upon the &s;ubject have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;everal parts of it with great ability: my object is, to add &s;ome &s;upplemental remarks to what they have laid down, which I think may tend to &s;trength|en and confirm the opinions of tho&s;e who have recommended hou&s;es of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t eligible method of drawing up a gene|ral plan for the &s;upport of the poor would po&s;&s;ibly be, to mark off in &s;ome of the be&s;t treati&s;es which have been publi&s;hed upon the &s;ubject, &s;uch principles and practical ob&s;ervation as ap|pear mo&s;t firmly founded upon political rea&s;on, or drawn from facts properly &s;tated; the&s;e de|tached materials may be reduced to their general heads, and the vacancies in the outline ea&s;ily marked in: an architect from a few ve&s;tiges and ruined members of columns, is able with the greate&s;t degree of certainty to make a draw|ing of the building in all its original magnifi|cence: the happine&s;s of a great people, is cer|tainly
<PB N="2" REF="3">
worthy the &s;ame enlightened and per&s;e|vering attention, which has frequently been mi&s;applied to re&s;tore &s;ome gothic de&s;ign of cla&s;|&s;ical antiquity.</P>
<P>But it is by no means my intention to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject &s;o exten&s;ively: the only points I mean to go into are, the &s;tate of the pre&s;ent bur|then and charge of the poors rate, the different expence of maintaining the poor in the pre&s;ent mode, and in incorporated di&s;tricts; and the probable amount of the advantage of adopting Mr. Gilbert's plan, with &s;uch alterations as may be found nece&s;&s;ary: I &s;hall endeavour likewi&s;e to add &s;omething to what has been &s;aid upon the advantages of a better and more regular educa|tion for the poor, and how far &s;uch incorpora|tions are favourable or adver&s;e to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the charge of the rate, laying down fir&s;t this di&s;tinction, that by charge we are to under&s;tand the &s;um paid, be the value of money what it will, by burthen, the propor|tion of that &s;um to our ability to pay it. Mr. Potter, in a very ingenious pamphlet publi&s;hed la&s;t year upon this &s;ubject, &s;tates the total a|mount of the poor's rate at three millions, the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
advance in nine years at 800,000: during that period the price of provi&s;ions has increa&s;ed in a geometrical progre&s;&s;ion, the increment of the poor rates has at la&s;t followed the &s;ame law, (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apendix, Note A. B.</NOTE>two po&s;itions which will be demon&s;trated in the Appendix) the rate of the 8th year will be 2,898,370l. and the augmentation of perpetual expence the ninth 101,630; and the value of this perpetuity, at 3&frac12; per cent. 2,903,714; the increa&s;ed charge therefore to the public, is equal to that &s;um added to the funded debt at 3&frac12; per cent. This augmentation gives the annual increa&s;e of the rate 3,506 per cent. and by the table in the Appendix, this rate of increa&s;e appears very moderate.</P>
<P>Taking the &s;urplus of the public revenue, which may in time of peace be applied to the di&s;charge of the debt at 900,000l. a &s;um it was &s;uppo&s;ed to produce before the annual pay|ment of 400,000 from the Ea&s;t India company was withdrawn; the value of the perpetuity 2,903,714 exceeds that &s;um in proportion as 3&frac15; to 1.</P>
<P>Hence the poor rate appears to increa&s;e the national expence three times as fa&s;t as that
<PB N="4" REF="5">
&s;urplus can dimini&s;h it, uniformly applied to the di&s;charge of that debt in the time of peace; &s;uppo&s;ing it to increa&s;e every year even with the &s;ame celerity as the poor rate.</P>
<P>It may be worth while, in order to point out the true extent of a charge thus increa&s;ing, to enquire what &s;um of money the public ought to pay down, to be delivered from it for ever.</P>
<P>Divide 100 by the difference of the rate of increa&s;e, and the rate of intere&s;t (uniformly taken at 3&frac12;) the quotient will be the number of years purcha&s;e of the original &s;um, which will equal the required payment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, Note D.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e the 1&s;t.</HI> If we &s;uppo&s;e the rate to con|tinue perpetually the &s;ame, or without increa&s;e, it will be worth 28&frac12; years purcha&s;e: let the pre&s;ent amount be 2,500,000 only, the pur|cha&s;e money will be 71,250,000.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e the 2d.</HI> Let the annual increment be 1&frac12;, or about &frac12;, the increa&s;e of the price of provi&s;ions; the number of years purcha&s;e will then amount to 50, and the &s;um 125 millions: very nearly equal the funded debt.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e the 3d.</HI> The lea&s;t rate of advance given in the tables, is 2,39 per cent. and to be reliev|ed
<PB N="5" REF="6">
from a charge perpetually increa&s;ing in that ratio, the public ought to give 90,09 years pur|cha&s;e; or a &s;um exceeding 225 millions.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;e the 4th.</HI> But the increa&s;e of charge exceeds the rate of intere&s;t: if it were barely equal, the former &s;ub&s;tracted from the latter leaves no remainder, and the number of years purcha&s;e becomes 100/0, or infinite.</P>
<P>The truth of this la&s;t conclu&s;ion may be ea&s;ily proved in the following manner; the rate at the end of the fir&s;t year becomes by the &s;uppo|&s;ition 103,5, the pre&s;ent value of which is 100; at the end of the &s;econd year it is increa&s;ed to 107,12, the pre&s;ent value of which is 100: rate of the third year 110,87, the fourth 114,75, the pre&s;ent value of each of which is like|wi&s;e 100; &s;o that to be di&s;charged from the next year's rate, we mu&s;t pay down a &s;um equal to the pre&s;ent or 100l.; for the next two 200; the three fir&s;t years 300, or &s;o many years pur|cha&s;e of the pre&s;ent value of the rate as we mean to be di&s;charged from: therefore to be di&s;|charged from all future expence, we mu&s;t pay down a &s;um equal to the pre&s;ent rate, multi|plied by the number of years to the end of time, or infinity.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">How far the poor rate has been an increa&s;ing burthen, is the next particular which offers it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>As &s;pecie repre&s;ents &s;ome real value in goods and commodities, the burthen of a rate mu&s;t be in proportion to that real value which the &s;pecie it rai&s;es repre&s;ents; if at one time 100l. repre&s;ent, or will purcha&s;e twice the real value in goods and nece&s;&s;aries which it does at ano|ther, a man who pays 10l. to a rate at the for|mer period, has double the real value taken from him which he would have in the latter; or the <HI>burthen</HI> is double upon him: in general, the burthen is always to be e&s;timated by the value of money and the &s;um conjointly, or their product: when the value of money augments, the burthen increa&s;es with it; when it dimi|ni&s;hes, it decrea&s;es in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>Having the rate of increa&s;e of the charge given, to determne that of the burthen, we mu&s;t endeavour to di&s;cover the annual decre|ment of the value of money.</P>
<P>The real value of a &s;um of money at diffe|rent periods, is proportioned to the number of people it will maintain with the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">The price of wheat, and the intere&s;t of mo|ney, have been both con&s;idered as the &s;tandard of this value: the former, being perhaps the greate&s;t article of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption, and much affecting the price of the re&s;t, will have a great effect upon it; but not one can ri&s;e or fall without influencing it in &s;ome mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The rate of intere&s;t is a &s;tandard &s;till more inadequate: this rate has continued the &s;ame for &s;ome years la&s;t pa&s;t, if particular circum&s;tances have not rather contributed to rai&s;e it: 100l. at the end of the year produces 3l. 10s. ten years after it produces the &s;ame &s;um; but will that &s;um at tho&s;e different periods repre&s;ent or equal the &s;ame real value of the nece&s;&s;aries of life? To prove 100l. of the &s;ame value at the one period as at the other, we mu&s;t make this a&s;&s;umption, that 3l. 10s. at the end, is equal in value, or repre&s;ents the &s;ame real value with 3l. 10s. at the beginning; the very principle wanted to be proved.</P>
<P>To determine the value of money, we mu&s;t find the quantity of commodities in kind which a certain number of men con|&s;ume in a year, and multiply each &s;eparate quantity by its price in the given year, ad|ding the&s;e together for a total: repeat the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;ame operation for any other year, and the two &s;ums will be reciprocally as the value of money at tho&s;e periods: or the greater &s;um will repre|&s;ent the value of money at the cheaper period, the le&s;s at the dearer.</P>
<P>But if we want to enquire into the law of in|crea&s;e or decrea&s;e, more of the&s;e periods mu&s;t be taken, and the hypothe&s;is tried by the totals they exhibit.</P>
<P>The account of the &s;tate of the hou&s;e of in|du&s;try at Nacton, drawn up by order of the Hou&s;e of Commons, contains all the different prices of wheat, beef, malt, and chee&s;e for 17 years; and the variations for every year care|fully marked: I reduced the different prices of each article in every year to a mean, and from thence formed the four tables given in the Ap|pendix.</P>
<P>This account begins with the year from Ea&s;ter 1757 to 58; the average of the fir&s;t four years will give the mean price of wheat Michaelmas 59; the following four Michaelmas 63, the &s;uc|ceeding five at Ea&s;ter 68, and the la&s;t four Michaelmas 72: this operation is to be repeated with the other three tables, and we may thus obtain a correct &s;tate of the advance upon each of the&s;e commodities for thirteen years.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">To a&s;certain the quantities con&s;umed in kind of each of the&s;e particulars, I copied an account of the con&s;umption of eight weeks, from the books of the hou&s;e of indu&s;try at Heckingham; this gives us the total con&s;umption of 2016 per&s;ons for one week, from whence we ea&s;ily deduce that of ten per&s;ons for a year. Multi|plying the quantity of every article of this re&s;ult by its price in each of the four years above men|tioned, the &s;um of the prices of all the articles in each year will be as the value of money that year, if tho&s;e articles had compri&s;ed all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>To in&s;ert the re&s;t, I computed from the be&s;t information I could procure, and principally derived from the &s;ame hou&s;e, the additional ex|pence at this pre&s;ent, for cloathing, fireing, &amp;c. and found it amount to 30s. a man. I then &s;uppo&s;ed the advance upon the&s;e articles, two thirds that of the others, that I might be &s;ure the conclu&s;ion might be below the truth.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e operations gives us the fol|lowing rate of increa&s;e for the price of provi|&s;ions:

<P><PB N="10" REF="11">The lower &s;eries are four terms in an inter|rupted geometrical progre&s;&s;ion, where the di&s;|&s;tance of the terms is equal the intervals of the time.</P>
<P>The&s;e coincide &s;o nearly with the numbers above them, as to point out that &s;uch a law nearly took place. Whatever the cau&s;e of this decrement of the value of money may have been, it &s;eems nearly uniform for the given time.</P>
<P>The annual decrement of the value of money during the whole period was 2,89 per cent. but in the fir&s;t four years, it amounted to 3,63 per cent. The rate of advance of the price of pro|vi&s;ion was con&s;iderably more from 59 to 63, than from 63 to the pre&s;ent time; which is con|trary to the general received opinion; it appears in tho&s;e four years to have been accelerated ,75 annually per cent. nearly &frac14; more than its mean increa&s;e: the four years from whence the &s;econd term is obtained, are the years 61, and tho&s;e immediately following; and this irregularity &s;eems to form no objection to the law, but to be the effect of the great &s;ums of money the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the la&s;t war brought into the nation: a cau&s;e which was barely beginning to operate
<PB N="11" REF="12">
in the fir&s;t period of four years, the average of which is therefore nearer its true level.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en to explain the principles upon which the&s;e tables are grounded at &s;ome length, as the con&s;equences deduced from them, upon a very important que&s;tion treated of in the Appen|dix, differ from what is delivered by &s;ome very re&s;pectable writers.</P>
<P>From what has been here laid down, we are able to determine the ratio of increa&s;e of the burthen of the poor rate: an e&s;tate which la&s;t year paid to the rate 100, will be by the average advance charged 103,506 for the expence of the pre&s;ent; but by the ri&s;e of provi&s;ions 102,89 at the end of a year, is equal in value to 100 at the beginning; therefore the burthen of tho&s;e two periods will be in proportion of 102,89 to 103,506, or as 100 to 100,6, and the advance of the charge is to the advance of the burthen as 6 to 1 nearly.</P>
<P>The further ob&s;ervations I had to make upon this head are referred to the Appendix;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note E.</NOTE> I have there demon&s;trated the operations of this payment upon the price of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">The la&s;t thing remaining is to determine the probable &s;aving to the public, by adopting a general bill for hou&s;es of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall be able to give a much more cer|tain an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, by enquiring what would probably have been the &s;um &s;aved, if &s;uch a bill had taken place at the &s;ame time Colnies and Carlton hundreds were incorpo|rated; and having di&s;covered that, we &s;hall ea&s;ily determine the advantage &s;ought.</P>
<P>The year ending at Ea&s;ter 1753, was the middle term of the &s;even years, from which their average charge was a&s;&s;e&s;t: I collected the rates of ten pari&s;hes for that year and the year 74, &s;ix of them &s;ituated near the incorpo|rated hundred, and added to them four pari&s;hes in Norfolk: the charge in the fir&s;t of the&s;e years amounted to 806..6, &amp;c. and in the la&s;t to 1345..5, &amp;c. the annual rate of advance appear|ed to be 2,39 per cent. Upon the&s;e grounds we find the pre&s;ent value of all the payments of a di&s;trict equal to the incorporated hundreds for the la&s;t 17 years; the difference between this &s;um and the pre&s;ent value of all the payments of the corporation, adding the balance between
<PB N="13" REF="14">
their debt and &s;tock, will give the amount of the &s;um &s;aved in &s;eventeen years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The annual payment of the hundreds is 1487..13, &amp;c. which increa&s;ing in the propor|tion &s;uppo&s;ed, would have become at the latter period 2506..7: from this we obtain the pro|bable pre&s;ent value of the &s;ums which would have been expended for maintaining the poor in the hundred,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note D.</NOTE>

<P>The number of years purcha&s;e of a rate which the&s;e &s;ums are equal to, have been joined to the re&s;ults given above; that if there &s;hould have been any error in fixing the amount of the poors rate of the whole kingdom at three millions, the account of the total advantage may be readily corrected.</P>
<P>The rate of intere&s;t in the&s;e computations has been taken 4 per cent. the rate of advance of the charge has been taken 2,39; while the price of provi&s;ions by the table has increa&s;ed 2,89 per cent. this mu&s;t be far beneath the average increa&s;e; as the price of labour though &s;ome|what augmented, has not increa&s;ed fa&s;ter, or even equally with the price of nece&s;&s;aries; and
<PB N="16" REF="17">
the number of paupers relieved has been gene|rally increa&s;ing: all the&s;e circum&s;tances toge|ther have co-operated to le&s;&s;en the account given of the value of the charge of maintaining the poor under the pre&s;ent laws.</P>
<P>On the other hand the &s;um &s;aved at Nacton has been the lea&s;t of any hou&s;e I have exami|ned; the weekly expence of a pauper exclu&s;ive of repairs, furniture, &s;urgeons and officers, has been at Nacton 2s. 7d. at Melton 2s. 1&frac12;d. and at Heckingham 1s. 10&frac12;d. either of the two latter would have given the advantages much more.</P>
<P>A method which would have brought us far nearer the truth, would have been to have tak|en the mean advance of the rates exhibited in the table as the advance of the poors rate, and compared the total expence for &s;eventeen years upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, with the mean ex|pence of a hou&s;e of indu&s;try; the weekly ex|pence at Melton approaches neare&s;t to &s;uch a medium.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have declined all computation of the advantages of the&s;e foundations deduced from the profit of Heckingham: at Mid&s;ummer next, nine years from the opening of the hou&s;e, half the original debt of 7000 will be paid off; and the rate reduced. We cannot expect its &s;ucce&s;s to be univer&s;ally equaled; the care of the directors, and the particular at|tention which Mr. Cooper has con&s;tantly paid to it, have put its funds upon a very &s;uperior footing: the promoters of the&s;e in&s;titutions mu&s;t greatly regret that he has laid a&s;ide an intention he had formed of adding a full account of the management of them, to the di&s;&s;ertations upon this &s;ubject he has already given to the public.</NOTE> But let us imagine the expence of the hou&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="18">
at Nacton would have been thus dimini&s;hed in proportion of 2s. 3d. to 2s. 7d. or 27 to 31: the pre&s;ent value of expence of the hou&s;e for the fir&s;t &s;eventeen years would have been reduced to 32272, and that of the future expences to 76157.</P>

<P>The difference then appears to be 104,566.</P>
<P>The probable amount of the rates of Colnies increa&s;ing every year 3,506 per cent. would be at the end of &s;eventeen years equal the average 1487 l. multipied by 1,03506^2^2; twenty-two years being pa&s;t &s;ince the year when the amount equaled the average; this difference therefore is 32,933 years purcha&s;e of the pre&s;ent rate: if therefore a bill had been pa&s;&s;ed at that period to have incorporated &frac23; of the kingdom, as &s;uppo|&s;ed
<PB N="20" REF="21">
above, the pre&s;ent value of the pa&s;t and fu|ture &s;aving would at this time have been 65,866,000; or (taking intere&s;t at 3&frac12; per cent) at its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;eventeen years &s;ince, 36,701,000 l. which was the value then, of the difference of expence to the nation, between the two modes of providing for the poor.</P>
<P>But the annual increa&s;e of the rates &s;ince has a little exceeded the di&s;count on the former &s;um, therefore the pre&s;ent value of the difference is at lea&s;t &s;ixty-five million.</P>
<P>The future expence 137384 is nearly equal 54 &times; 2506 and therefore about fifty-four years purcha&s;e of the pre&s;ent rates.</P>
<P>The rate of annual advance in this &s;tate per cent. 2,18 about 9/10 of the lea&s;t increa&s;e near the pre&s;ent period, I have been able to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>And the charge of the two different modes is to each other, as 88884 to 193450; or as 1 to 2 2/11 very nearly.</P>
<P>If we &s;u&s;pect a conclu&s;ion to be exaggerated which brings out the value of a rate fifty-four years purcha&s;e, the re&s;ult of the following &s;up|po&s;ition may tend to de&s;troy the objections we entertain again&s;t it: Admit the true value of a rent charge to be &s;o high as 3&frac12; per cent. and
<PB N="21" REF="22">
that for twenty-five years la&s;t pa&s;t, the rates of a pari&s;h have increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion we have &s;een them for a con&s;iderable period la&s;t pa&s;t, and then &s;top forever: how many years purcha&s;e of the fir&s;t year's rate is the va|lue of &s;uch a perpetual payment?</P>
<P>Here the rate of increa&s;e &s;omewhat exceeds the rate of intere&s;t; but admitting it to be e|qual, and the rates of the pari&s;h 100 l. a year: by rea&s;oning as before on the &s;ame ca&s;e the pre|&s;ent value of the fir&s;t twenty-five years pay|ments at the beginning of the term will be 2500 l. or twenty-five years purcha&s;e; the remaining perpetuity at the end of the term, will be worth the rate of the twenty-&s;ixth year, multiplied by 28&frac12; the number of years purcha&s;e it is worth, if it continues without augmentation for ever: but the pre&s;ent value of that rate at the begin|ning of the twenty-five years is equal 100 l. and the value of the perpetuity 2850 l. or 28&frac12; years purcha&s;e of the original rate: &s;uch a rate there|fore appears to be worth 25 &times; 28&frac12; &equals; 53&frac12; years purcha&s;e; the reduced hypothe&s;is gives it fifty-four years.</P>
<P>A pari&s;h which twenty-five years ago had given to redeem its poor rates, the then pre&s;ent
<PB N="22" REF="23">
vale of all the &s;ums it has paid &s;ince, added to the perpetuity of the pre&s;ent rate, would have &s;aved all the probable future advance upon it; therefore 53&frac12; years purcha&s;e was le&s;s than the value of &s;uch a rate by all the probable future ad|vance; an hypothe&s;is which &s;tates it at 54, mu&s;t fall nearly as far below the truth &mdash; we &s;ee that all the rea&s;ons which might have been then urged again&s;t its being an eligible contract, would at this in&s;tant been refuted by the experi|ence of the pa&s;t period; and what arguments can be now brought again&s;t it, which could not have been urged with equal or &s;uperior pro|bability then; they had not then to encounter and bear of the pa&s;t period.</P>
<P>But to remove every degree of doubt about the re&s;ult, I added together the rates of all the pari&s;hes which I had taken for long periods: all of them but one accidentally happen to give the lowe&s;t annual increa&s;e; the rate of increa&s;e of the whole thus added was &s;omething under the general advance, being equal to 3,4742 per cent. the rates for the term of twenty-five years were worth at the beginning of that period 24,09, and the remainder of the perpetuity 28,39; the whole 52,48: which deducted form 54, leaves
<PB N="23" REF="24">
about 1&frac12; years purcha&s;e of the rates twenty-five years &s;ince, or about 17/26 of the value of a rate at pre&s;ent, as equal to all the future advances which may happen.</P>
<P>That I may fini&s;h here every thing that relates to calculation, I &s;hall add &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the bills of mortality in hou&s;es of indu&s;try; on the proportion of power to be granted to guar|dians and directors; and on the probablility of the&s;e in&s;titutions being neglected in future pe|riods.</P>
<P>The regi&s;ters in hou&s;es of indu&s;try have u&s;u|ally been kept in the general mode: But the names of the paupers who died, with their ages and di&s;tempers, and day of admi&s;&s;ion into the hou&s;e, has been generally entered into the report book at Heckingham &s;ince March 1772: by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of that entry, and &s;uch information as the governor &s;upplied me with concerning &s;o re|cent a period, I was able to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who died of di&s;tempers with which they were admitted into the hou&s;e, from tho&s;e who died by di&s;orders contracted after their entry: the number of the former in this period were 70, of the latter 123; but during this term a malig|nant fever raged very much both in the hou&s;e and country from Chri&s;tmas 73 to Mid&s;ummer 74;
<PB N="24" REF="25">
in periods of average health the&s;e numbers were as 21 to 22; and therefore taking a medium between the&s;e proportions, the corrected re&s;ult comes out as 21 to 29, and the deaths 29/50 of the total exhibited by the regi&s;ters: as the&s;e di&s;tinc|tions have not been made in tho&s;e returns to the hou&s;e of commons I have &s;een, I thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert them here, to obviate an objec|tion which might otherwi&s;e be very rea&s;onably made to the mortality of the &s;everal hou&s;es.</P>
<P>In the time of the general illne&s;s mentioned, forty-nine died admitted ill from the country, and an hundred and one re&s;ident in the hou&s;e; this di&s;order, which was of the putrid kind, was brought into the hou&s;e from the country: the &s;tate of the air &s;eemed at that time particularly fatal to old per&s;ons, of the latter number no le&s;s than twenty were above &s;eventy-five; the &s;mall pox carried off &s;ix or &s;even, and three were lo&s;t by inoculation; incidents which will reduce the number nearly to its ju&s;t proportion.</P>
<P>When we want information we are generally &s;o happy as to di&s;cover, what would have been the proper form to dige&s;t records, which at pre|&s;ent are &s;o kept as to be of very little u&s;e; I am &s;en&s;ible that the &s;cale upon which the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions
<PB N="25" REF="26">
are formed, is not &s;o exten&s;ive as it ought to be; but they are the be&s;t grounds I could procure: I had drawn up &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon regi&s;ters before I knew what had been done upon that &s;ubject by Dr. Price, I incorporated his ob&s;ervations afterward with my own, and have given them in the Appendix.</P>
<P>It was an ob&s;ervation of one of the directors of this hou&s;e, and confirmed by the governor, that the children when admitted had too gene|rally a very meagre emaciated appearance; and that the difference between tho&s;e newly entered, and tho&s;e who had been in the hou&s;e &s;ome time, was very &s;triking: in that ca&s;e it mu&s;t pre|&s;erve a number of u&s;eful lives to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The only &s;ufficient rea&s;on for entru&s;ting a &s;et of men with the exerci&s;e of any power, or the expenditure of a certain revenue, is their intere&s;t in the application of it, or their ability or both conjointly: in con&s;idering the&s;e particulars we &s;hall ea&s;ily determine how far the old law, which in its operation has flung the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ums collected for the poor into the hands of the over&s;eers in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, was political or right; we &s;hall be thence likewi&s;e able to form an idea, what weight their di&s;&s;ent to the
<PB N="26" REF="27">
incorporation of a particular di&s;trict ought to carry; and with what rea&s;on they may com|plain of an abridgement of their powers by the late acts.</P>
<P>The average length of lea&s;es throughout the kingdom is difficult to a&s;certain; but though we cannot a&s;&s;ign a term of years which &s;hall pre|ci&s;ely equal it, we may a&s;&s;ume one, which we are &s;en&s;ible from the nature of things mu&s;t great|ly exceed it: to compute the proportional inte|re&s;t of the landlord and tenant in the poor rates, I have therefore &s;uppo&s;ed all the lands in the kingdom under lea&s;es of fourteen years, and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition the intere&s;t of the owners to that of the occupiers will be as 14&frac23; to 1: but this gives the tenant's intere&s;t greatly above the true value; had we &s;tated the average length of lea&s;es at nine years, it would have fallen con|&s;iderably &s;hort of half as much.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of men been equally rai&s;ed above temptation, equally enlightned with re&s;pect to the true political principles upon which the exten&s;ive detail of police depends, in that ca&s;e &s;uch would have been the proportion in which authority ju&s;tly would have been di&s;tri|buted to them: it is true, that among the occu|piers
<PB N="27" REF="28">
there are per&s;ons to be found re&s;pectable for their character and information; I am not certain whether Emer&s;on farms his own e&s;tate: but a con&s;tant attendance upon their own affairs, and an education not training them much to re|flection, will &s;tamp a general character upon the whole cla&s;s, which will render them improper for public duties: yet &s;uch is the order of the the people to whom the &s;pirit of the laws now in being commits the expenditure of a revenue, who&s;e pre&s;ent purcha&s;e appears to be equal to the national debt: expo&s;ed to the peculation or mi&s;management of every di&s;hone&s;t or ignorant man to who&s;e charge it is intru&s;ted: experience points out what numbers may be fairly ranged under both the&s;e heads&mdash;an error in legi&s;lati|on perhaps &s;ingle in its kind.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trate has by law &s;ome check upon the officer; but the in&s;tances of po&s;&s;ible mi&s;|conduct are &s;o numerous, that the remedy in its operation is far from being in any degree equally exten&s;ive with the evil &mdash;Every &s;ub&s;equent check po&s;&s;ible may be provided, but where the expenditure of a fund in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, with|out &s;uperior direction, is lodged in the hands of the mo&s;t improper cla&s;s of people, the manner
<PB N="28" REF="29">
in which it will be applied will be &s;trongly marked with the characters of the men: a &s;tream which takes its ri&s;e and flows over a &s;oil full of mineral particles will imbibe all its nox|ious qualities; nor will it be greatly altered by the addition of a trifling rivulet, which may fall into it in &s;ome part or other of its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But to this it may be replied, "that there will be little advantage re&s;ulting to the public, from removing the&s;e powers out of the hands of per&s;ons who may abu&s;e, to place them in the hands of tho&s;e who will ab&s;olutely neglect the u&s;e of them; while the &s;pirit which planned and formed a new in&s;titution &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, the attendance given by the managers is con&s;tant; but like every other kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m it is &s;tronge&s;t at its fir&s;t apparance; difficulties in the executi|on damp it, but the tedium of attendance wear it out entirely: the original in&s;titutors had a kind of per&s;onal attachment to their own plan, which engaged many others to a duty which bore the ap|pearance of per&s;onal attention to them; but to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors it is only a common care in which they are equally engaged with many; this is a &s;econd and certain &s;ource of diminution of at|tendance, and what is the &s;um total which we
<PB N="29" REF="30">
obtain by the alteration of e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems? to exchange old abu&s;es with old names, for old abu&s;es with new ones.</P>
<P>This is an objection which has been much dwelt upon; we mu&s;t mea&s;ure the effect of the&s;e cau&s;es to dimini&s;h the attendance of directors by what experience has already pointed them out to be: the mo&s;t proper in&s;tance will be that of the olde&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of this kind, where they will di&s;cover them&s;elves mo&s;t fully and clearly: and here it has happened that every one of the cau&s;es mentioned in the objection have operated with greater force than in any other in&s;tance which (to the be&s;t of my know|ledge) can be produced: the average numbers attending the annual meetings at Nacton from 60 to 75 inclu&s;ive, were for the fir&s;t five years ten, the &s;econd 12&frac25;, the third 134/5, and in the la&s;t year 20: the book from whence I extracted this account goes back no further than 1760.</P>
<P>Another branch of &s;ubject which I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider was the advantages of a better and more regular education, which this &s;y&s;tem in a con|&s;iderable degree provides for the poor.</P>
<P>The elegant and fanciful Rou&s;&s;eau has at|tacked all education in general; and made
<PB N="30" REF="31">
happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in every human &s;avage, liv|ing alone in his cave, being very dirty, wearing no cloaths, and keeping his nails long enough to dig his own pignuts; this puts him above the artificial wants contracted in &s;ociety: but a much &s;uperior philo&s;opher of our own country has particularly written again&s;t the education of the poor; and very clearly demon&s;trated that &s;harpers, highwaymen, and pickpockets, were the mo&s;t patriot characters: his conclu&s;ion from this principle was very properly drawn: you mu&s;t &s;uffer your poor to remain uneducated, otherwi&s;e they will not be quite &s;o beneficial to the public.</P>
<P>Bad principles in philo&s;ophy joined with great and u&s;eful di&s;coveries, &s;eem to have the &s;ame fortune with the little qualities of great men: they have &s;o much fal&s;e lu&s;ture flung upon them by the neighbourhood they &s;tand in, that they almo&s;t &s;eem to &s;hine by their own light: it is particularly unlucky for my pre&s;ent argu|ment, that the&s;e objections again&s;t the utility of education &s;tand in &s;uch re&s;pectable company; that will be enough to deter me from attacking them in detail, but not from laying down what I think may be urged on the contrary &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">The man who writes, and the man who reads, have frequently very different opinions of the importance of the branch of the &s;ubject under pre&s;ent con&s;ideration; but the con&s;equences which I think may be drawn from this head, will induce me to go into it with particular at|tention.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions who&s;e irregular indulgencies produce the wor&s;t effects in &s;ociety, do not attain any degree of &s;trength before the period of a common education is pa&s;&s;ed; and the princi|ples of &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion implanted in mind by nature, di&s;cover them&s;elves there a long while previous to them: for this rea&s;on, in the earlier &s;tages of life, we receive and retain impre&s;&s;ions of virtue much ea&s;ier than tho&s;e of vice; on account of their nearer analogy to that &s;et of emotions which then reign in their full &s;trength, while tho&s;e which afterwards attain more than power enough to counterbalance them, have not yet arrived at force or maturity.&mdash; Impre&s;&s;ions of this kind early made on the mind, are long retained; and being frequently repeat|ed, by virtue of that repetition become &s;o deep|ly and habitually infixed, as to obtain the &s;ame force and permanent efficacy with tho&s;e impre&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="32" REF="33">
originally &s;tamped there by nature: in this manner a few fir&s;t principles early inculcat|ed, and frequently repeated, win their way into the heart, and maturer years fortify by reflecti|on, what habit before had rendered almo&s;t a &s;econd nature.</P>
<P>We cannot long per&s;onate any character but that &s;ome part of it will attach it&s;elf to us and become our own; that warmth with which we endeavour to render the deception compleat, carries us beyond the mark de&s;igned, and con|verts appearance into reality: the con&s;tant ac|tion of an internal principle produces the exter|nal appearance of it; and by a kind of reflex operation, the a&s;&s;uming the external appearance, con&s;tantly fortifies or even gives birth to the internal principle: we have frequently &s;een a bare external &s;hew of religion improve into ge|nuine piety; while a mock defence of the de|&s;olate maxims of the <HI>morales lubriques,</HI> or an air of libertini&s;m worn in the gaiety of &s;ome un|happy hour, has fixed a bias on the mind which has not with ea&s;e been &s;haken off: tho&s;e who have attacked the utility of all in&s;titutions for the education of the children of the poor, have owned that they produce an external appear|ance
<PB N="33" REF="34">
of decorum, indu&s;try, and a&s;&s;iduity, the tendency of the&s;e external appearances to &s;trike deeper root, and improve into reality, converts this conce&s;&s;ion into a &s;trong argument in favour of &s;uch in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>To live agreeably in any &s;ociety, our gene|ral conduct mu&s;t be &s;uch as not to draw upon our&s;elves any particular degree of di&s;e&s;teem from it: few people I believe were ever &s;o ab&s;urd as to go for plea&s;ure, or even to propo&s;e tolerable conveniency to them&s;elves, in a road where there is an ince&s;&s;ant multitude continually thronging the oppo&s;ite way: elbowed on one &s;ide, pu&s;hed on another, 'tis hard to &s;truggle again&s;t popular opinion: there are not many practical principles who&s;e operations by an in&s;pection into the actions of mankind at large we can di&s;cover to be &s;o exten&s;ive, and in their effects &s;o infal|lible: a kind of external force operating upon us either prevents us from deviating from that train of action public opinion has marked out for us, or the pain we receive from every excen|tricity quickly recals us to it: if we &s;hould admit that the efficacy of that education I am recommending extends no further than correct|ing our opinions, without correcting our prin|ciples,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
the oblique effect of &s;uch reformation of our &s;entiment mu&s;t be well worth &s;ecuring, and be productive of the mo&s;t advantageous con&s;e|quences to the manners and morals of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Let us endeavour to trace its effects from the ob&s;ervation I had before laid down: a man who by a better education is improved only in his judgment of virtue and vice, when the merits of an individual with whom he is uncon|nected by relation, prejudice or favour, comes to be di&s;cour&s;ed of, will candidly pronounce of them according to tho&s;e improved &s;entiments he has imbibed; far the greater part of &s;ociety &s;tand in this very identical relation to every in|dividual of which it is compo&s;ed; hence the public at large will appreciate the merits of any action the better, the more generally tho&s;e prin|cipales by which it ought to be judged are dif|fu&s;ed; that general cen&s;ure on every deviation becomes more preci&s;e, more enlightened, and more certainly pa&s;&s;ed: the train of action mark|ed out by public opinion being rendered more agreeable to the laws of rea&s;on and virtue, be|comes more agreeable to the public intere&s;t, and in the path thus marked out for them, the generality of mankind will always walk. But
<PB N="35" REF="36">
whatever lights the &s;uperior part of mankind may thus enjoy, if they do not reach the cla&s;s below, they will certainly fail of producing this effect among them. If a man do not run counter to the &s;entiments of that cla&s;s of life in which his principal connections lay, to violate the ideas of right or wrong entertained by tho&s;e much above, or much below, can little affect him; in this re&s;pect he may be &s;aid to live in a different &s;ociety; and from hence ari&s;es the ne|ce&s;&s;ity, that the&s;e grounds of judgment &s;hould be equally diffu&s;ed in every rank of life.</P>
<P>Nor does it form a rea&s;onable objection to &s;uch an education, <Q>that its effects are by no means infallible: that nature and pa&s;&s;ion will frequently triumph over &s;uch &s;light ob&s;tacles as habit and education oppo&s;e to them; that their efficacy is always found lea&s;t when the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity calls for their &s;upport: there are &s;ome men who&s;e violent appetites tran&s;port them with &s;uch exce&s;s, that no edu|cation can infu&s;e a proper counterpoi&s;e to them; other who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions balanced in the exacte&s;t moral equilibrium, are &s;o harmo|nized as to preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of every de|gree of in&s;truction; with the former it mu&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="37">
be inefficatious, with the latter &s;uperfluous.</Q> But in the &s;cale of human di&s;po&s;itions there are many intermediate degrees between the&s;e two extreme limits, near which we find them very thinly &s;cattered; and almo&s;t every character occupies a &s;pace much nearer the middle point than is commonly a&s;&s;igned; con&s;equently the con&s;tant operation of habit and education (though their power were much le&s;s than ex|perience &s;hows it to be) may determine on which &s;ide they &s;hall be found; and it would be ab&s;urd to reject any de&s;ign generally u&s;eful, becau&s;e its benefit could not be extended to every uncommon ca&s;e an inventive imagination can propo&s;e.&mdash;Education operates on the mind with a gentle and &s;ecret influence: yet this un&s;een bias, though not di&s;coverable per|haps in one or two particular in&s;tances, will be clearly di&s;cerned in a &s;eries of many actions, and form the predominant character of them.

<P>Though the general in&s;titution of hou&s;es of indu&s;try will not provide for the education of all the children of the poor, yet the good effect which would re&s;ult from a general provi&s;ion will be an&s;wered in proportion to the extent of the partial provi&s;ion propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The rea&s;oning above laid down &s;eems in &s;ome degree confirmed by an effect already experien|ced: it was an ob&s;ervation of the governor of one of tho&s;e hou&s;es I have vi&s;ited, that the children born in the hou&s;e or admitted very young, were the mo&s;t orderly and indu&s;trious: tho&s;e who&s;e relations or parents came into the hou&s;e with them, being abetted and encouraged by their friends, were extremely irregular and idle; and that this difference in their behavi|our was very perceptible. A remark which clearly points out two facts very important to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, that the training the children of the poor receive in their cottages is of the wor&s;t kind, and that the education and controul of a hou&s;e of indu&s;try provides an adequate re|medy to it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">But the&s;e in&s;titutions have been attacked upon another ground: it has been alledged that <Q>a pauper is deprived of his civil liberty by being &s;hut up in one of the&s;e magnificent pri|&s;ons, and put under the controul of a go|vernor: nor does the incon&s;i&s;tency end here, every law &s;hould have a certain analogy to the principle upon which the government of a &s;tate is founded: where it is incon&s;i&s;tent with it, it cla&s;hes with and tends to weaken that principle if it be only local; if general, it &s;aps its very foundation: this maxim is the fundamental ground of the true &s;pirit of law in every country: the principle of this go|vernment is civil liberty, and can that prin|ciple remain unimpaired, when a law is made, which actually reduces a great number, and &s;ubjects half a people to a probability of per&s;onal confinement?</Q></P>
<P>Before we admit this rea&s;oning (which I think I have propo&s;ed in its full force) it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ee how low down the idea of civil liberty can extend in the free&s;t government; and in what manner a di&s;ciple of Locke, the mo&s;t enlightened and zealous advocate of free|dom, would take it up.</P>

<HEAD>On the Burthen of the Public Debt.</HEAD>
<P>A Writer of the fir&s;t abilities, Dr. Price, has in a late publication repre&s;ented the burthen of the national debt to be &s;o much in|crea&s;ed, as to threaten the &s;ubver&s;ion of public credit: as the data I have collected to point out to what degree the burthen of the poor rate is augmented, and the principles laid down to de|termine it, appeared to me during my enquiries upon this latter &s;ubject to apply equally to the former, I &s;hall endeavour to di&s;cover upon the&s;e grounds what has been the increa&s;e of the public burthen &s;ince the commencement of the la&s;t war, what operation it has had upon the price of provi&s;ion, and the probable period in which we may expect to be able to di&s;charge it.</P>
<P>There cannot be a &s;ubject on which an error on either &s;ide can be attended with wor&s;e con&s;e|quences; an opinion of the near danger of pub|lic bankruptcy produces almo&s;t all the evils which could come upon us were the danger
<PB N="48" REF="49">
real: it annihilates public credit, it tempts the attacks of our enemies, to which our ill ground|ed fears make us oppo&s;e a very ineffectual re&s;i&s;t|ance; it de&s;troys that public vigour, and per|&s;evering &s;pirit of private enterprize, which form the be&s;t trea&s;ure and happine&s;s of a &s;tate, and even where they do not find ability create it. &mdash;But the danger is equal on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide: When a nation has but a few la&s;t means of &s;afety left, if they be &s;quandered away by a confidence in re&s;ources which do not exi&s;t, it renders certain and precipitates a ruin which wi&s;er mea&s;ures might have avoided.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty and extent of the &s;ubject; which is to be enquired into upon the principles of a &s;cience which I never pur|&s;ued to any great length, and which I have &s;ome years entirely laid a&s;ide; and believe I &s;hould have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any ob&s;ervations which might have occurred to me upon it, if the enlightened attention of the public which &s;ome late writers of great merit have called out, had not rendered it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any error to pa&s;s into a ge|neral opinion.</P>
<P>The burthen of a tax, or the total taxes of a country, mu&s;t be in proportion to that part of
<PB N="49" REF="50">
the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the people which it takes away: if a tax took away 1/10 part of the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of a people twenty years &s;ince, and an equal portion at this pre&s;ent time, its burthen is preci&s;ely equal: if it take away more it increa&s;es, if le&s;s it dimini&s;hes: Money repre&s;ents &s;ome real value in goods and commodities, and if a tax at two different periods take away the repre&s;enta|tive of 1/10 of our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the buthen of that tax upon a people at tho&s;e different times is equal.</P>
<P>In this calculation and tho&s;e which follow I take the &s;um of our annual charges and my data in general from Dr. Price: the amount of the taxes in 55 was 5,097,617, exclu&s;ive of the land tax at two &s;hillings in the pound 866,666; and the total payment 5,964,283: from which the difference of the burthen in that year, and the year 74, when the total amount of the taxes was ten million, is ea&s;ily derived: we are fir&s;t to in|ve&s;tigate what &s;um of money in 74 was of equal value with the &s;um of the taxes in 55; this term comprehends nineteen years, admit the va|lue of money to have decrea&s;ed at the rate of 2,16 per cent. annually, for the whole term: the real
<PB N="50" REF="51">
value then of 5,964,283 in 55, was equal to 5,964283 &times; 1,0216^1^9 or 8,963,800, in 74: or the&s;e &s;ums at tho&s;e periods were equal burthens upon the people.</P>
<P>The taxes in 1774 amounted to ten millions; the proportion of the public burthens in 55 and 74 was as 89638 to 100,000; or as 1 to 1, 11: but the re&s;ult would have been as 1 to 1, 67, if we had confounded the charge and the burthen as the &s;ame thing; a mode of proceeding which gives the advance of the latter &s;ix times too great: for this rea&s;on the conclu&s;ions of Dr. Price, and tho&s;e writers who never lay down that di&s;tinction when they treat of increa&s;ing burthens, and the mea&s;ure of their effect upon the national credit, mu&s;t be erroneous.</P>
<P>The annual decrement of the value of money upon which this calculation and &s;ome which fol|low are founded, is I think a&s;&s;igned with mode|ration: the article in the table from which I de|duced it which advanced with the greate&s;t cele|rity was corn: yet it &s;eemed uniform through all the period ob&s;erved, which points out a perma|nent cau&s;e. Many might be ea&s;ily in&s;tanced, that luxury introduced by the fortunes made in the la&s;t war, over and above the immediate con|&s;equence
<PB N="51" REF="52">
of an increa&s;e of wealth; a change of the manner of life in the farmers who rai&s;e the&s;e commodities; who have in their own con&s;ump|tion &s;ub&s;tituted more expen&s;ive articles, in&s;tead of the cheaper and &s;impler which formerly &s;up|plied them: and the fortunes made by many in a &s;hort time, which have excited the avidity of almo&s;t all to grow rich in ha&s;te: the&s;e if entered into at length would be found be&s;t to corre&s;|pond to the effects ob&s;erved. If the former years of the period (for which the regi&s;ter of prices I have u&s;ed was kept) were rather more plentiful than the latter, the exportation permit|ted then tended on the other hand to rai&s;e tho&s;e prices, and the re&s;traint in the latter to dimini&s;h them: and during tho&s;e years of greater plenty the advance was found mo&s;t rapid: but that ad|vance could not be owing to exportation only, or the &s;ame cau&s;e at any other period would have produced the &s;ame effect: nor would any thing but a deficiency in the productions of the earth increa&s;ing every year, produce it, which can with no probability be &s;uppo&s;ed: it was out of the power of an uniform deficiency to have cau&s;ed it: the price mu&s;t have come to its ut|mo&s;t heigth in a &s;hort time, and there remained
<PB N="52" REF="53">
fixed indeed, but not progre&s;&s;ive.&mdash;But that the annual decrement of the value of money might be &s;u&s;pected of no exaggeration, I have &s;uppo&s;ed the value of corn to have ri&s;en only half the &s;um the Nacton table points out, and from thence deduced the rate of decrea&s;e 2,16 per cent. annually.</P>
<P>If we had taken the fall of money 2,89 as exhibited in the table, the burthen of the taxes would have appeared dimini&s;hed 1/40, or 245,610 l. yearly: that of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment 1/13, and that of the debt increa&s;ed 1/10</P>
<P>The public annual charges are compounded of the intere&s;t of the debt added to the other current expences, which may de&s;erve to be con|&s;idered &s;eparately. The debt at the beginning of of the la&s;t war was &s;eventy-two millions, and &s;uppo&s;ing the intere&s;t paid the public creditors equal in both times, &s;uch a burthen was equal to 108,2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 at the end of 74. The public debt then amounted to 137 millions, and the pro|portion of the national burthens in tho&s;e years was as 108 to 137, or as 1 to 1,266. To &s;up|po&s;e the burthen and actual &s;um the &s;ame, would give this rate of increa&s;e as 1 to 1,903:
<PB N="53" REF="54">
or the difference of burthen nearly 3,4 times too much.</P>
<P>If we deduct the intere&s;t of the debt from 5,964,283 l. the total taxes of 55, the remainder will be the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment together with the &s;ums applied to the di&s;charge of the debt: the intere&s;t amounts to 2,565,000 l. admitting it to be proportional to that of the pre&s;ent debt; the difference applied to the purpo&s;es mentioned a|bove amount to 3,399,283 l. which equalled in value 5,108,900 in 74: the remainder of the public revenue in 74 applied to the&s;e purpo&s;es after the di&s;charge of the intere&s;t of the funded debt was 5,119,320, exceeding the former &s;um 1/500 which gives the addition to the burthen. During the la&s;t peace we have annually paid off 916,666 l. of the debt, during the former 750,000, the difference is 166,666 l.</P>
<P>The expence of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment has been loudly objected to: it appears however from the la&s;t con&s;ideration to have been a de|crea&s;ing burthen, though a much more con|&s;iderable force has been kept up by &s;ea and land than before the commencement of the la&s;t war.</P>
<P>The debt in 1715 was fifty-five millions, and nearly the &s;ame it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed at the peace
<PB N="54" REF="55">
of Utrecht. The national intere&s;t then was &s;ix per cent. the pre&s;ent debt 137, its intere&s;t 3&frac12;; and admitting both the&s;e &s;ums to be redeemable funded debts, the intere&s;t on each will be 3,300,000 l. and 4,795,000 l. if we calculate the value of money for 1715 from an average of ten years of which that is the middle term, we &s;hall find a revenue of 3,300,000 at that period, equal in value to 4,699,000 in 1774. Our burthen therefore in tho&s;e forty-nine years is augmented barely 1/50; and we may in rea&s;on|ing upon this &s;ubject &s;uppo&s;e them perfectly equal.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to follow from this conclu&s;ion, that the total of all our national exertions &s;ince the peace of Utrecht, have been no more than equal to our abilities; becau&s;e our burthens have not been increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>That there is no more rea&s;on to apprehend a national bankruptcy now, than there was at that period; and the fears which were then en|tertained, have been &s;ince refuted by experience.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved of late years that &s;ome of our funds have become more productive, the advantages re&s;ulting to the nation from &s;uch a circum&s;tance de&s;erve a little attention.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">The proportion of the pre&s;ent value of the perpetuity of an encrea&s;ing to a fixed fund, is as the rate of intere&s;t, to the difference between that and the advance&mdash;That of a decrea&s;ing fund, as the intere&s;t to the &s;um of the intere&s;t and rate of advance&mdash;And that of an increa&s;|ing to a decrea&s;ing fund, as that &s;um to the difference mentioned above. An example will make this &s;ufficiently clear&mdash;Let there be three funds each of 100,000, the fir&s;t increa&s;ing 1&frac12; per cent. annually, the &s;econd fixed, the third decrea&s;ing at the &s;ame rate the fir&s;t increa&s;es; let 3&frac12; be the rate of intere&s;t, the value of the increa&s;ing fund will be to that which remains fixed as 3&frac12; the rate of intere&s;t to 2 the difference of the advance and intere&s;t, or as 7 to 4: the real value of the fir&s;t is five millions, the &s;econd 2,857,142, and the difference 2,142,858&mdash;The value of the decrea&s;ing to the fixed fund will be 3&frac12; to 5, or 7 to 10, and the perpetuity of the third fund will be 2,000,000, the lo&s;s 857,142; and the difference between the increa&s;ing and de|crea&s;ing fund 3&frac12;&plus;1&frac12;, to 3&frac12;&minus;1&frac12;, as 5 to 2.</P>
<P>Therefore the lo&s;s upon five funds perpetually decrea&s;ing at the rate of 1&frac12; per cent is only e|qual to the gain upon two increa&s;ing funds.</P>

<P>After having &s;aid &s;o much on the relative mea&s;ures of burthens, the next &s;ubject which naturally offers it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration is its ab&s;olute mea&s;ure, or what every man pays in the pound in proportion to his con&s;umption of commodities.</P>
<P>There are no data I believe to determine this que&s;tion exactly, the utmo&s;t we can do is by a probable conjecture to approach near the truth.</P>
<P>A land tax of 4s. in the pound according to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, was &s;ome years ago e&s;timated to rai&s;e no more than 1s. 6d. of the rack rent: the rent of the kingdom will thus appear to amount to 23 millions; the product taken as three times the rent 69 millions; admit the additional value of our manufactures 2/7 of our whole production, the value of our manufactures will thus come out 27,600,000; and &s;uppo&s;ing &frac23; con&s;umed at home, that con&s;umption amounts to 18,400,000l. and our exports to 9,200,000. For which we
<PB N="57" REF="58">
import foreign commodities of which the value to the con&s;umer will be 10,120,000, reckoning 10 per cent. only for freight and mercantile pro|fit; I have here &s;uppo&s;ed no balance of trade in our favour: our annual con&s;umption therefore appears to be 97,520,000 l. add 10 millions the &s;um of the taxes, and the total expence of the kingdom is 10,752,000 a year, and the ab&s;olute mea&s;ure of the burthen <GAP DESC="math">, or <GAP DESC="math"> of our total expence; &s;omething le&s;s than 1..10&frac12; in the pound. Mr. Ma&s;&s;ie in 1761 calculated the taxes paid by the farmer in proportion to his con|&s;umption at 1s. 10d. in the pound; upon what ground he formed his conclu&s;ion I do not know.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of the debt being nearly half the taxes its burthen will be 11&frac14; in the pound. Mr. Hanway has endeavoured to compute the annual con&s;umption of the kingdom upon different principles; he begins his account with a &s;up|po&s;ition which can no ways be admitted, that the ordinary rent is twenty times the value of a land tax at one &s;hilling in the pound, this evi|dently gives the re&s;ult far too little.</P>
<P>That the land annually produces on a medium four rents, I have &s;uppo&s;ed but three.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">That the other articles to be added are half the produce, exceeding the proportion a&s;&s;umed here as 5 to 4.</P>
<P>If he had &s;uppo&s;ed the rents to bear the com|mon e&s;timated proportion to the land tax, the con&s;umption of the kingdom would have come out 138 millions annually; the total expence of taxes and con&s;umption 148; the burthen 1/15, or more nearly 1s. 5d. in the pound.</P>

<HEAD>Of the effect of public burthens on the price of pro|vi&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>Suppo&s;ing the unreduced advance of prices drawn from the tables true, it appears that the price of provi&s;ions and the money levied in taxes, have &s;ince the beginning of the la&s;t war advanced almo&s;t in equal degrees; it may be proper therefore to examine upon this &s;uppo|&s;ition, whether the increa&s;e of the public expen|ces have not rai&s;ed the prices of provi&s;ion, and thus created an apparent ability to &s;upport them, at the expence of a much heavier evil.</P>

<P>And let the price of nece&s;&s;aries increa&s;e dur|ing this period from any other cau&s;e acting in conjunction with this; as for in&s;tance the aug|mentation of the quantity of money, in the &s;ame number of years the effect of the annual dimi|nution of provi&s;ion will be at its greate&s;t height, and at all &s;ub&s;equent periods, the rate of in|crea&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="62">
of price will go on in the &s;ame proportion as if it had been effected by the quantity of money alone.</P>
<P>If in&s;tead of commodities in kind their repre|&s;entative &s;pecie had been &s;ub&s;tituted, its effect would have been the &s;ame, if the &s;ums taken had at the different times a&s;&s;igned, repre&s;ented the &s;ame real value: for no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign|ed why taking away the repre&s;entative &s;hould produce a greater effect than taking away the real value repre&s;ented by it.</P>
<P>When the proportion of nece&s;&s;aries thus taken or &s;pecie repre&s;enting them uniformly increa&s;es, it continually tends to increa&s;e the price of pro|vi&s;ion which then has no maximum. The in|crea&s;e of the burthen of the poor rate has been 1,00616 for nine years la&s;t pa&s;t; its efficacy to rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ion has po&s;&s;ibly been to that of all the other cau&s;es operating with it as 616 to 2,89, about &frac16; of the whole.</P>
<P>When the burthen decrea&s;es the prices of pro|vi&s;ion (if no other cau&s;es operate) decrea&s;e with it. If we admit the decrement of the value of money which the table gives to be true, the burthen of our annual taxes &s;ince the commence|ment of the la&s;t war has decrea&s;ed 1/40; therefore
<PB N="62" REF="63">
<HI>a fortiori</HI> they have not been the cau&s;e of any de|crement in the value of money.</P>
<P>If we rea&s;on from the reduced hypothe&s;is which gives the value of money 2,16, our bur|then being now no more than it was at the death of Queen Anne, the pre&s;ent difference of the price of provi&s;ion compared with that of three or four years after, cannot be a&s;cribed to it: for if it had continued the &s;ame during the whole interval, it would have produced its utmo&s;t effect in three or four years after the peace of Utrecht; and the &s;ub&s;equent advances mu&s;t have been attributed to &s;ome other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a &s;triking difference between the ope|ration of a debt with its annual intere&s;t levied upon the public, and a tax of the &s;ame amount applied to the current &s;ervice: for the two an|nual payments of the public &s;imply as &s;uch would produce the &s;ame effect upon the price of provi&s;ion: but if there had been no fund to ve&s;t the capital of the debt in, a great part of the money now compo&s;ing it would have been laid out in the purcha&s;e of lands; this would have increa&s;ed their price; to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf this extraordinary expence, the new purcha&s;er rai&s;es his rents, and this rai&s;es the price of provi&s;ion.
<PB N="63" REF="64">
And the intere&s;t paid to foreigners again dimi|ni&s;hes its efficacy, being a diminution of the quantity of money in the kingdom.</P>
<P>But admitting the decrement of the value of money a&s;&s;igned too high, there is another argu|ment which I think puts this beyond a doubt: a nation which funds in&s;tead of defraying the current expences of war and peace by immediate taxation, at fir&s;t is ea&s;ed of paying the principal, by only taking the burthen of the intere&s;t: as the debt increa&s;es this intere&s;t increa&s;es until it be|comes as much as would have equalled the ave|rage expence of war and peace if there had been no debt; its la&s;t &s;tage is where the intere&s;t ex|ceeds that average. During the fir&s;t two peri|ods the &s;um of all its taxes will have been much le&s;s than in the former &s;y&s;tem, and therefore they will have produced an effect con&s;iderably le&s;s in rai&s;ing the price of provi&s;ions; we are now nearly in the &s;econd of the&s;e periods as I &s;hall have pre&s;ently occa&s;ion to &s;hew, and there|fore provi&s;ions have hitherto been cheaper on ac|count of our funding.</P>
<P>Yet I am by no means inclined to extenuate the con&s;equences of a &s;y&s;tem, which if not re|ceded from in time, may &s;till for a certain pe|riod
<PB N="64" REF="65">
continue to lighten our own burthens by the ruin of po&s;terity: but a general di&s;pon|dence from views which I conceive pre&s;ent our &s;ituation in too dark a point of light, may di&s;|courage and even di&s;able us from making u&s;e of tho&s;e re&s;ources which remain to us. Though the debt appears not to have been an increa&s;ing burthen, funding may very well be conceived to be an ineligible mode of defraying the public expence. Let us therefore enquire into the pre|&s;ent value of the difference of our &s;y&s;tem of fund|ing, and that of rai&s;ing &s;uch taxes uniformly &s;ince the beginning of la&s;t war, as would have compleatly di&s;charged the &s;ums it was then ne|ce&s;&s;ary to borrow, at the end of that term of years for which we might rea&s;onably expect the continuance of peace. This &s;um added to our peace e&s;tabli&s;hment will give us the amount of our taxes in ca&s;e we had no debt, and enable us to determine the lo&s;s of the kingdom by funding according to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of that debt.</P>
<P>The proportion of the number of years of war to tho&s;e of peace &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent century, has been as 7 to 12: the ope|rations of the la&s;t war begun in the &s;pring of 1756, and included &s;even years; and the pro|bable
<PB N="65" REF="66">
expectation of peace was twelve years. The debt contracted in the war was 76 millions, and &s;uppo&s;ing the annual grants all equal, the extraordinary expence amounted to 10,857,142l. per annum, an extraordinary revenue of 5,011,400, would have di&s;charged that debt with its intere&s;t by the time another war would probably have commenced: we mu&s;t add to this the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment for the army, navy, civil li&s;t, and the annual debt upon the&s;e articles amounting to 4,850,000l. and the whole reve|nue annually rai&s;ed upon the public would thus amount to 9,861,400l. which falls &s;hort of the pre&s;ent &s;um rai&s;ed by the taxes 139,600 l. about 1/70.</P>
<P>During the peace the debt has been dimini|&s;hed to 65 millions, but to have di&s;charged that &s;um in the &s;ame term of time, 4,286,066l. a year mu&s;t have been levied in additional taxes, or in the whole 14,016,746l.: in both the&s;e ca&s;es we &s;hould have begun the &s;ub&s;equent war with the &s;ame debt upon us we did the former, but the different &s;ums of money to be rai&s;ed upon the people to bring us into the &s;ame &s;ituation would have been as 98 to 140, or as 7 to 10: which I think to be the difference of the real value to the kingdom in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
between the &s;y&s;tem of funding and that de|&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>If the debt were annihilated it does not &s;eem that we &s;hould be able to reduce our taxes with|out the probability of being obliged to create a new one; becau&s;e the intere&s;t of the debt is very nearly equal the &s;um we &s;hould annually pay to prevent coming into that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding, this points out the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing for a certain term of years the mo&s;t efficacious methods of reducing the public debt: I therefore proceed to enquire into the means Dr. Price has recommended to ef|fect this.</P>
<P>He has &s;uppo&s;ed we may be able at lea&s;t to obtain of America a fund of 300,000 a year.</P>
<P>The colonies are &s;aid to double their numbers in 25 years, but let us &s;uppo&s;e the term 35 in which the quantity of land flung into cultivation is doubled. If a tax be laid upon the land already broken up, amounting to 300,000 per annum, which he &s;eems upon the authority of Lord Shelburne to con&s;ider as attainable, and all future grants be a&s;&s;e&s;t at half as much again for the &s;ame quantity of land; the rate of in|crea&s;e of cultivated land will be 2 1/35 or 1,219
<PB N="67" REF="68">
per hundred acres yearly; which would be the increa&s;e of the tax if the lands newly brought into cultivation were a&s;&s;e&s;t at the &s;ame rate with the old; but they are &s;uppo&s;ed to pay half as much again, or the tax to increa&s;e 1,8285 per cent yearly, and taking the intere&s;t of money at 3 1/2, and the debt at 137 million, it would be di&s;charged in 70,3 years by that fund, and an annual burthen of 4,880,0<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 annihilated, with a clear addition to the revenue at the end of that term of 1,066,530 l.</P>
<P>There is one particular property attending &s;uch a mode of taxation, that all frauds at the original a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, and tho&s;e which may be com|mitted afterwards, act contrary to and will near|ly de&s;troy each others effect. A fixed &s;um is to be paid; if the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in his account delivered in dimini&s;h the quantity of land he holds, &s;uch a diminution will augment the tax upon equal quantities, and the &s;um will remain the &s;ame; but it will al&s;o augment the revenue from lands afterwards brought into cultivation in the proportion of 3 to 2: and if the future frauds in re&s;pect of quantity be equal to the pa&s;t, the revenue will upon the whole gain; if they
<PB N="68" REF="69">
exceed them in proportion of three to two, it will not lo&s;e.</P>
<P>But be&s;ide the tax from the colonies, which I &s;uppo&s;e to remain as &s;tated above, the following are &s;ome of the re&s;ources which he points out as remaining to the nation for the di&s;charge of the debt.</P>
<P N="1">1. The annual &s;urplus of the revenue 300,000l.</P>
<P N="2">2. The land tax to be continued at 4s. in the pound the amount of the additional &s;hilling 450,000 nearly to be thus applied.</P>
<P N="3">3. In 1781 there will be an addition to the annual &s;aving of 189,863l.&mdash;18,986,300l. principal debt falling from 4 per cent. to 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. In 1782 a further addition of 22,500l.&mdash; 4,500,000l. more being reduced from 3&frac12; to 3 per cent.</P>
<P N="5">5. In 18 years the greate&s;t part of 224,580l. per annum annuities will be extingui&s;hed; as the&s;e will fall into the &s;avings gradually, let us &s;uppo&s;e them all to &s;ub&s;i&s;t together 12 years, and then at once to fall off. Then in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8 the fund will be further augmented 224580l.</P>
<P>The&s;e funds conjointly will di&s;charge the debt in <GAP DESC="math"> years, and if we further were to &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="70">
the affairs of the Ea&s;t India Company &s;o far retrieved, as to be able in two or three years to pay 300,000 a year to government, the debt will be di&s;charged in 37 years nearly.</P>
<P>In determining this period I &s;uppo&s;ed the rate of intere&s;t 3&frac34; per cent. for the following rea&s;ons; when a fund &s;inks below par, as for in&s;tance to 90, it may be privately bought up; if it ri&s;e above as to 110, the creditor will &s;ubmit to a reduction of 8 per cent. rather than be paid off at 100: the&s;e particulars have been fully point|ed out by Dr. Price, I have therefore &s;uppo&s;ed their effect equal to &frac14; per cent. added to the common rate of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible perhaps to form any well-grounded hypothe&s;is of the future annual de|crement of the value of money; but upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that it will be for the next 71 years &frac23; what the following table gives it for the term it comprehends, that our future wars &s;hall have the &s;ame proportional length as the former in this century, and our operations be as exten&s;ive as in the la&s;t, our new debt will be paid off in 30,88 years, the whole in 72, and the burthen continue nearly the &s;ame during the entire term of payment. But toward the latter end of
<PB N="70" REF="71">
the&s;e periods, the di&s;charge of the debt might be perhaps too much accelerated; and &s;uch a quan|tity of money be flung into the hands of the pub|lic creditors, as mu&s;t greatly and rapidly encrea&s;e the price of land and con&s;equently of provi&s;ion; the effects this might produce upon commerce and indu&s;try merit &s;ome con&s;ideration, there is a limit which the payment of the Briti&s;h creditors ought not to exceed; when it gets to that, it might perhaps be expedient with the overplus to begin to di&s;charge the principal due to foreign|ers, which therefore it would be right to re&s;erve 'till nearly the la&s;t; becau&s;e we might be obliged to &s;top in the cour&s;e of payment earlier than we otherwi&s;e &s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated to; nor ought even that in any period of its di&s;charge to exceed a certain proportion of the balance of trade in our favour, it might otherwi&s;e deprive us of our &s;pecie.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the debt with a recapitulation of what has been endeavoured to be proved:</P>
<P N="1">I. That the burthen of the taxes from 56 to 74 increa&s;ed 11/100.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="71" REF="72">II. That in rea&s;oning upon this &s;ubject if we con&s;ider burthen and charge as &s;ynonimous terms, the increa&s;e re&s;ulting will be &s;ix times too much.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the increa&s;e of the burthen of the debt in the &s;ame period is only 266/1000, but ac|cording to the &s;econd method of e&s;timating it, it appears to be 903/1000, or 3,4 times too great.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment has not been an increa&s;ing burthen, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperior force kept up.</P>
<P>That the burthen of the annual &s;um paid to the public creditors, was the &s;ame nearly at the peace of Utrecht as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The burthen of paying off the debt with a given annuity at that period the intere&s;t 6 per cent. and that of the pre&s;ent the intere&s;t 3 &frac12; per cent. would be found not differing in a very great proportion: but to a&s;&s;ign this, it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to go into a detail exceeding the limit which &s;hould be allowed to a &s;ubject merely col|lateral.</P>
<P>That the gain by a fund which becomes annu|ally more productive, greatly overbalances the lo&s;s by a decrea&s;ing fund.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">That the &s;y&s;tem of funding has not yet rai&s;ed the price of nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>That the ab&s;olute burthen of the taxes is 1s. 10&frac12;d in the pound, of the debt 11&frac14;d: but that the difference between the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of funding, and impo&s;ing &s;uch taxes as might pro|bably at the di&s;charge the expence of one war by the commencement of the following, is as 10 to 7.</P>
<P>But that all fears of public bankruptcy, grounded upon a mea&s;ure of public burthens, which does not take the decrea&s;e of the value of money into con&s;ideration, appear for that rea&s;on ill founded.</P>
<P>That the&s;e conclu&s;ions may be compared and under&s;tood with more facility, I have dige&s;ted them into the form of a table.</P>

<P>Annual advance per cent. 2,89 for thirteen years the whole term; 3,63 for the fir&s;t four years.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">This annual advance is equal the annual de|crement of the value of money.</P>
<P>The numbers in the la&s;t article, &s;undries, were found in the following manner; the pre&s;ent ex|pence for 10 paupers in one year, from the be&s;t e&s;timate of particular articles I could obtain, amounted to 15l. the rate of increa&s;e was then a&s;|&s;umed equal to &frac23; that of the other articles.</P>
<P>But there is an apparent irregularity in the ad|vance; an acceleration in the fir&s;t period of ,74 per cent. the cau&s;e of this, and its preci&s;e mea|&s;ure may very probably be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>We very ea&s;ily di&s;cover two temporary cau&s;es of acceleration which then took place; the in|crea&s;e of taxes, and the fortunes made in the la&s;t war, and brought over from the Ea&s;t Indies. We will &s;uppo&s;e the effect of the latter &frac35; that of the former: The annual average increa&s;e of the debt la&s;t war was about 11 millions, and in the middle of that period we are con&s;idering it was nearly 126 millions, and the annual increment of the burthen 11/126; we found the ab&s;olute bur|then when the debt was 137 millions to be 11&frac14; in the pound; at 126 it therefore was 10&frac14;, and the increment in pence 112,75/126: admit with Dr. Price that &frac14; more is rai&s;ed upon the public for

commodities by the increa&s;e of taxes, than the &s;um paid to government; the total increment of the price of provi&s;ions will be 140,9375/126, or in the terms of a pound <GAP DESC="math">, or <GAP DESC="math"> per cent.: the effect of the influx of money &frac35; of the former amounts to <GAP DESC="math"> per cent.; and their joint operation <GAP DESC="math"> for the acceleration of the increa&s;e of the price of provi&s;ion &equals; ,7457 per cent. but the mean advance by the table ap|pears to be 2,89, the accelerated advance 3,63, and the effect of the accelerating cau&s;e ,74 as de|termined above.</P>
<P>To this it may be objected that it has been demon&s;trated, that taking the decrement 2,89 the increa&s;e of taxes has not rai&s;ed the price of provi&s;ions in 19 years, but the rea&s;ons alledged above not only admit that the taxes in &s;ome of the given years increa&s;e the prices of commodi|dities, but even a&s;&s;ign the quantity of that aug|mentation.</P>
<P>The period mentioned was during the war, the operation of a tax newly laid on is to rai&s;e the price of nece&s;&s;aries, and con&s;equently to drop the value of money: during a war of &s;even years, if taxes increa&s;e in a &s;uperior proportion to the fall of the value of money, the public

burthen increa&s;es; if money continue to fall (as the table points it out) in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive year of peace the &s;ame tax will have le&s;s value, or become a le&s;s burthen than the former; and as there are twelve years of peace to &s;even years of war, the decrement of burthen in twelve years, taking the yearly rate 2, 89, will balance the in|crea&s;e in &s;even.</P>
<P>The numbers therefore corrected by removing the&s;e cau&s;es of perturbation would &s;tand thus:

<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that the correction of the numbers, founded on a probable hypothe&s;is, is probably, but not perhaps mathematically true; there being no demon&s;tration of the a&s;&s;umption on which it is founded, it is certain however that &frac58; of the irregularity ought to be &s;ubtracted, if we allow no efficacy to the influx of money; but whatever be allowed will abate the remaining &frac38;. There is the greate&s;t probability that the an|nual decrement of the value of money has not been over-rated after the reduction I have al|lowed;
<PB N="81" REF="82">
it is much more probable that it falls &s;hort of the true mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Con&s;iderable u&s;es might (I &s;hould be inclined to think) be derived from accurate tables kept in this manner.&mdash;Government has already or|dered regi&s;ters to be kept of the principle arti|cles in it; if the others were likewi&s;e added, the bu&s;ine&s;s of granting relief to the poor, might be regulated upon &s;uch fixed principles as to be always proportioned to the nece&s;&s;ity of the pau|per applying for relief in every variation of prices: the quantities of the different nece&s;&s;aries of life to be con&s;umed in kind by a family of every probable number, may be found with very little difficulty; then the different expence of maintaining ten men for a year deduced as above may be given in the fir&s;t column of a table, and in a line with every different charge (which need not exceed twelve in number) the weekly expence of a family of every different &s;ize: &s;uch a table might be compri&s;ed in one folio page and need no alteration for many years. The prices of many articles of provi&s;ion are I believe delivered in at the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions; a clerk might every half year draw out an ac|count of the charge of &s;upporting ten men an|nually
<PB N="82" REF="83">
at the rates of the time being; it would be compleated in four or five &s;hort multiplica|tions. The numbers in the line oppo&s;ite the neare&s;t &s;um in the table, would give the weekly expence of a family of every probable &s;ize: the the weekly earnings of the pauper &s;ub&s;tracted from this, will give the weekly allowance: proper di&s;cretionary additions may be made in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>If the relief thus proper to be granted to a family of every &s;ize (tran&s;cribed from the general table) were publi&s;hed in the provincial papers at the &s;ame times, they would form a check upon either the avarice or profu&s;e folly of a pari&s;h officer.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome very good con&s;equences might be derived from general ab&s;tracts of the accounts of the different hou&s;es of indu&s;try being yearly adverti&s;ed in the county papers, with the ave|rage expence of maintaining ten paupers for the la&s;t year, compared with the charge of the &s;ame number formed by the prices of that part of the country, as in the forgoing article. If &s;uch an in&s;titution by the negligence of the directors in general &s;hould be &s;uffered to fall into improper hands (of which I think there is no probable
<PB N="83" REF="84">
danger) this compari&s;on would be an account of their mi&s;management, the mea&s;ure of it ex|actly defined, and their own accu&s;ation to the public. The different expence of maintaining that number of paupers in different hou&s;es would be ea&s;ily compared, and the cau&s;e examined into by the director of that di&s;trict who&s;e charge amounted to the greater &s;um: it would be a check upon the unnece&s;&s;ary expence or illiberal par&s;imony of either, and all &s;uch corporations be continually approaching to the be&s;t plan of pro|viding for their poor.</P>
<P>It would render this new &s;y&s;tem likewi&s;e ca|pable of being made more general: the proba|bility of the abu&s;e of &s;uch in&s;titution ari&s;es from the want of a &s;ufficient number of directors, but dimini&s;hing the probability you make fewer directors nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We may thus likewi&s;e approach tolerably near the &s;olution of a political difficulty of &s;ome con|&s;equence; to regulate the price of labour by the &s;tate; if ever it &s;hould be found expedient to attempt &s;uch a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature may know at what mean price the public intere&s;t requires work of a certain kind to be fixed, but determine that price inva|riably

by &s;tatute, and every labourer (let his &s;trength or &s;kill be ever &s;o different, as the quan|tity of neither can be defined) receives equal wages: as the value of money falls, there will be a nece&s;&s;ity of frequently altering the &s;tatute, or the labourers are reduced to the mo&s;t abject di&s;tre&s;s: fixing labour of different kinds to rates which ri&s;e and fall by the prices of provi&s;ions deduced from a table formed in the manner I have given, would take away the latter objection, but leaves the fir&s;t. To remedy that, when a &s;ervant was hired for a certain period, the &s;um fixed by agreement might be con&s;idered as a rate or proportion; and the payment &s;hould increa&s;e or decrea&s;e with the variations of the value of money. A &s;hort annual table might be given before Michaelmas for the whole kingdom, which would contain every variation of rate, or the ju&s;tices of the peace for the &s;eparate counties might draw up one at the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ions, as the prices of the different counties are not perfectly equal. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that there would never be occa&s;ion for any alteration of the rate of hireing&mdash;That the labourer would be paid according to his abilities and the nece&s;|&s;ity of his ma&s;ter for his &s;ervices&mdash;That he would always receive the real value in proportion to the
<PB N="85" REF="86">
terms of his agreement, in&s;tead of a nominal &s;um&mdash; Wages always bearing nearly the &s;ame proportion to the price of provi&s;ions, equal la|bour would generally procure an equal quantity at every price; which would tend to dimini&s;h popular in&s;urrections.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the price of labour to be now a cer|tain number of years behind the price of provi|&s;ions as four or five; every other circum&s;tance is ea&s;ily deduced from that point of time when fixed: but there certainly is &s;ome delicacy requi|&s;ite in fixing it.</P>
<P>I had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider before in the Ap|pendix, the effect of a land tax in a country not fully &s;ettled, but where population and &s;ettle|ment advanced with great rapidity. If far the greater part or the whole of the revenue a coun|try draws from its colonies were by &s;uch a tax, the rate of which was made fixed and permanent, it would give greater &s;ecurity to the coloni&s;t for the peaceable enjoyment of the re&s;t of his pro|perty, than &s;ucce&s;&s;ive taxes impo&s;ed at various times to make up the &s;ame amount. There certainly is no inju&s;tice in &s;ubjecting a future age to bear the &s;ame burthens, and contribute the &s;ame real value to the parent &s;tate their prede|ce&s;&s;ors did; if the ab&s;olute taxation for equal
<PB N="86" REF="87">
quantities of land varied every ten years, accord|ing to the variation of the value of money in the colony for the preceding term, deduced from a table of this kind, the burthen of an individual would at the mo&s;t di&s;tant period of time always be in proportion to his ability, and be equal upon equal property. The money produced by it would increa&s;e in a complicate proportion of the increa&s;e of the &s;ettlement, and the ri&s;e of provi&s;ions; this augmentation would continue after &s;uch a &s;ettlement was fully peopled, in proportion as they applied them&s;elves to arts and commerce.
