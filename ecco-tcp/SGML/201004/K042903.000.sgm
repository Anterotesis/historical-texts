<P>A REVIEW OF DOCTOR JOHNSON'S NEW EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE: IN WHICH THE IGNORANCE, OR INATTENTION, OF THAT EDITOR IS EXPOSED, AND THE POET DEFENDED FROM THE PERSE|CUTION OF HIS COMMENTATORS.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY act, &s;ays goodman Delver, hath three branches: 'It is to <HI>act,</HI> to <HI>do,</HI> and to <HI>perform</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamlet.</NOTE>.'&mdash;Contemptible as this piece of ca&s;ui&s;try may be deemed; certain it is, that our hone&s;t grave-digger was not mi&s;taken in the <HI>number</HI> of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the inve&s;tigation of moral merit. He was not &s;o happy, indeed, in his &s;pecifi|cation of the parts to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. His logic, however, may pa&s;s, if we conceive the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> part of his divi&s;ion to comprehend the de&s;ign or intent of the act; the <HI>&s;econd</HI> the manner of putting it in exe|cution; and the <HI>third,</HI> the effects or con&s;equences produced by it.</P>
<P>Thus, in apologizing for the pre&s;ent <HI>Review,</HI> there are three things to be con&s;idered. 1. The de&s;ign or intent of writing it. 2. The manner in which it is
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
written; and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> the probable effects or con&s;e|quences that will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the former; the Reviewer begs leave to expre&s;s his motives for writing in the words of an ingenious author, who &s;tood exactly in the &s;ame pre|dicament.
<Q>I thought it a piece of ju&s;tice due to the memory of Shake&s;peare, to the reputation of let|ters in general, and of our Engli&s;h language in particular, to take &s;ome public notice of a per|formance, which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, hath violated all the&s;e re&s;pects. Had this been done by a common hand, I had held my peace; and left the work to that oblivion, which it de&s;erves: but when it came out under the &s;anction of a great name, that of a gentleman, who had by other writings, how ju&s;tly I &s;hall not [<HI>now</HI>] examine, obtained a great repu|tation for learning; it became an affair of &s;ome con&s;equence; as chimerical conjectures and gro&s;s mi&s;takes might by the&s;e means be propagated for truth among the ignorant and unwary; and that be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the genuine text, nay, the ge|nuine text amended too, which is neither Shake|&s;peare's nor Engli&s;h <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to the Canons of Critici&s;m.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Such being the motives of action, the intent and de&s;ign of the act is plainly what is &s;et forth in the title, viz. to defend the text of Shake&s;peare from the <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> of his commentators.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">The Reviewer is well aware that Dr. John&s;on's &s;elf|&s;ufficiency may &s;ugge&s;t a more &s;ini&s;ter view. For, he doubts not, that gentleman <HI>thinks</HI> of him&s;elf, what he has <HI>&s;aid</HI> of Dr. Warburton, that he has
<Q>a name &s;ufficient to confer celebrity on tho&s;e who can exalt them&s;elves into antagoni&s;ts;</Q>
and hence he may po&s;&s;ibly impute the pre&s;ent work to the motive which he in&s;inuates to have actuated the opponents of that writer. The allu&s;ion, al&s;o, of the eagle and owl, which he quotes from Mac|beth, may, with a very little latitude of con&s;truction, be applied as well to him&s;elf and the Reviewer, as to Dr. Warburton and his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>'An Eagle, tow'ring in his pride of place,</P>
<P>'Was, by a mou&s;ing owl, hawk'd at and kill'd <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. John&s;on's preface to his edition of Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.' For tho', Dr. John&s;on having neither preferment in the church, nor po&s;t in the &s;tate, the word <HI>place</HI> may &s;eem to want that &s;trict propriety the critics require; yet, if we reflect how nearly <HI>places</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ions</HI> are allied, there is not one of Shake&s;peare's commentators who would make any &s;cruple of &s;ub&s;ti|tuting one word for the other, reciprocally, and alter|nately, as he thought the ca&s;e might require. There is no doubt al&s;o that, on this occa&s;ion, the word pen&s;ion would be preferred; as a pen&s;ion mu&s;t be univer&s;ally allowed, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> to be better than a place, to a man &s;o fond of doing but little; as it is apprehended the reader will think is the ca&s;e with Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">To invalidate, however, the force of &s;uch a &s;ug|ge&s;tion, the Reviewer is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of apparently boa&s;ting, that, in this re&s;pect, he does not lie under the di&s;advantage of being exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the author of the Canons of Critici&s;m; who frankly confe&s;&s;es, that it was the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as it was the <HI>only</HI> book he wrote in his life. Dr. John&s;on indeed may, in all probability, have never before heard the name of the pre&s;ent writer. He hath neverthele&s;s &s;ome little literary reputation to lo&s;e; which he would not unadvi&s;edly or wantonly put to the hazard.</P>
<P>This long-expected edition of Shake&s;peare is not the fir&s;t work, by many, that he hath <HI>reviewed,</HI> nor is this Review the only book he hath written: For, tho' the name of Dr. John&s;on is much better known than the merit of his writings, his Reviewer, on the contrary, hath hitherto cho&s;en rather to have the merit of his writings known than his name. The publication of the one is of con&s;equence to the world, that of the other of none but to the writer; with who&s;e per&s;onal importance or in&s;ignificance the public have nothing to do <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In confirmation of what is here a&s;&s;erted, it may po&s;&s;ibly be thought nece&s;&s;ary to name &s;ome of tho&s;e publications, on which the public have conferred the honour of a favourable reception.&mdash;It is pre&s;umed needle&s;s, however, to particularize performances that would certainly have been le&s;s faulty, had they been le&s;s nu|merous. The author contents him&s;elf, therefore, with mentioning only his Epi&s;tles to Lorenzo; and the Tran&s;lations of Rou&s;&s;eau's Eloi&s;a, and Emilius.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">With regard to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> divi&s;ion of our prefa|tory &s;ermon, re&s;pecting the manner in which this Review is written; the author can readily fore|&s;ee, that he &s;hall be thought to have treated both Dr. John&s;on and Dr. Warburton with an ill-becoming levity, if not with unmerited &s;everity: at lea&s;t, this he conceives will be the opinion of tho&s;e, whom an innate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own weakne&s;s in|&s;pires with a <HI>timidity,</HI> which they mi&s;call, and flatter them&s;elves to be, CANDOUR. The Reviewer con|fe&s;&s;es indeed he &s;hould have been glad to have had, on this occa&s;ion, le&s;s to do with the commentary of the reverend gentleman la&s;t mentioned. And this, he hath rea&s;on to think, would have been the ca&s;e, had not Dr. John&s;on been prevailed on by his printer pru|dentially to cancel &s;everal annotations, in which he had &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;&s;ent from that learned &s;cholia&s;t. But having, on &s;econd thoughts, judged it expedient to &s;helter him&s;elf, as it were, under the wing of the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter; it is hoped the ju&s;tice due to Shake&s;peare will excu&s;e the Re|viewer, tho' he &s;hould be &s;ometimes obliged, in cor|recting his pre&s;ent editor, to ruffle and expo&s;e an irreverend feather or two of the Bi&s;hop's.</P>
<P>That he may not be &s;u&s;pected, however, of at|tempting to injure either, from a principle of &s;pleen or re&s;entment, he can &s;afely aver, with regard to both, what another of Dr. Warburton's antagoni&s;ts hath declared in re&s;pect to him alone; i. e.
<Q>That
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
he is per&s;onally a &s;tranger to either of the&s;e gentle|men; never conver&s;ed with them; never &s;aw them [<HI>but once</HI>]; never had the lea&s;t communication with them of any kind; never hath received or &s;olicited any favour from either; nor, on the other hand, hath been ever per&s;onally di&s;obliged by them; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible this proceeding can have been influenced either by di&s;appointment or re&s;entment. The truth is, that the Reviewer hath always under&s;tood it to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed law in the republic of letters, wi&s;ely calculated to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of in&s;ult, petulance and ill-nature, too apt to &s;hoot up in the &s;plenetic re|ce&s;&s;es of &s;olitary literature, that every writer &s;hould be treated on the &s;ame foot of civility, on which, when unprovoked by prior ill u&s;age, he hath been accu&s;tomed to treat others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preface to the <HI>Revi&s;al of Shake&s;peare's text.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
Now, whether he he hath treated either of the&s;e gentlemen wor&s;e than they have treated Shake&s;peare, he dares appeal to the impartiality of the public; which, at whatever low e&s;timation it may rate an ob&s;cure author, who hath never &s;et his name to a book; it will hardly think there can be a greater difference between <HI>him</HI> and this <HI>par nobile fratrum</HI> of commentators, than there is between them and the inimitable writer on who&s;e works they have &s;o freely commented. If the Reviewer hath at any time, indeed, behaved to|wards the&s;e gentlemen with <HI>little</HI> ceremony, it hath been always when they de&s;erved much <HI>le&s;s:</HI> for it is
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
to be ob&s;erved, he had nothing to do with the poli|tical characters of either. He did not think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, therefore, to pay any deference to Dr. John|&s;on, as his maje&s;ty's pen&s;ioner; nor to Dr. Warbur|ton, as bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter. Their literary cha|racter was all that concerned him; and even, viewing them in this light, he had to re&s;pect them only as commentators on Shake&s;peare.&mdash;</P>
<P>Not that the Reviewer piques him&s;elf on being deficient in point of civility, or would take upon him&s;elf to infringe the nece&s;&s;ary forms of decency and decorum. He admits, as Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves,
<Q>that re&s;pect is due to high place, and tenderne&s;s for living reputation:</Q>
but then he conceives that re|&s;pect to be limited both as to place and time; and cannot admit that any tenderne&s;s for the Living gives us a right to trample inhumanly and &s;acrilegi|ou&s;ly on the Dead.</P>
<P>Had the Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, when he entered on that right-reverend function, made a public recan|tation of the errors of poetry, and formally re|nounced the pomps and vanities of verbal critici&s;m; not one of the here&s;ies he maintained, or the &s;ins he committed in this kind, ab&s;urd and enormous as they were, &s;hould, with the Reviewer's con&s;ent, have ri&s;en up in judgment again&s;t him; or have been dragged from that oblivion, to which they &s;eemed eternally con&s;igned. But if either Dr. Warburton, or his friends, pre&s;ume on the influence of lawn|&s;leeves
<PB N="x" REF="9">
in the republic of letters, it is proper to inform them there are neither Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts nor Deacons in that community. The republic of let|ters is a perfect democracy, where, all being equal, there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, but every one hath a right to &s;peak the truth of another, to cen&s;ure with|out fear, and to commend without favour or affec|tion. Nor is the <HI>literary</HI> community of le&s;s dignity than the <HI>political.</HI> Popularity and influence, indeed, may be obtained, for a while, by &s;ini&s;ter means in both; but though birth and wealth may confer eminence and power in the one, not the de&s;cent of an Alexander, nor the riches of Croe&s;us, confer prerogative or authority in the other.</P>
<P>In the primitive &s;tate of &s;ociety, a &s;uperiority of intellectual abilities was the foundation of all civil pre-eminence; and hence the &s;ceptre continued to be &s;wayed by &s;uperior wi&s;dom through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages. The acqui&s;itions of &s;cience and learning were held among the ancients, in no le&s;s e&s;teem than tho&s;e of conque&s;t, and in as much greater than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of royalty, as a chaplet of laurel was preferred to a coronet of mere gems and gold. Xenophon reaped more honour from his Cyropaedia, than from the famous retreat of the ten thou&s;and; and Cae&s;ar &s;till more from his commentary, than from all the military exploits recorded in it. As to the examples of modern times; to &s;ay nothing of James and Chri&s;tina, le&s;t it be objected that one was a weak man, and the other a fooli&s;h woman, we have
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
&s;een the kings of Pru&s;&s;ia and of Poland, the Alex|ander and the Ne&s;tor of our age, ambitious to be|come authors, and be made denizons of our little &s;tate. Frederick hath been more than once heard to &s;ay, he would give his crown, and Stani&s;laus, if he had not lo&s;t it, would have given another, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ci|entific fame of Leibnitz, or the literary reputation of Voltaire.</P>
<P>Is it, by the way, then, to be wondered at, that a private individual, like Samuel John&s;on, &s;hould be even prepo&s;terou&s;ly elated at finding that homage paid to him, which has been in vain &s;olicited by &s;overeigns, and is refu&s;ed even to the King on his throne? Graduated by univer&s;ities, pen&s;ioned by his prince, and &s;urrounded by pedagogues and poeta&s;ters, he finds a grateful odour in the incen&s;e of adulation; while admiring book&s;ellers &s;tand at a di&s;tance, and look up to him with awful reverence, bowing the knee to Baal, and holding in fearful remembrance the exemplary fate of Tom O&s;borne; pre&s;umptuous Tom O&s;borne! who, braving the ven|geance of this paper-crowned idol, was, for his teme|rity, transfixed to his mother-earth by a thundering folio! It may be a pity to di&s;turb Dr. John&s;on from &s;o plea&s;ing a reverie, and to di&s;&s;ipate &s;o agreeable a &s;cene of delu&s;ion; he will exclaim doubtle&s;s, with the hone&s;t citizen of Argos.
<Q><L>Pol me occidi&s;tis&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;cui &s;ic extorta voluptas,</L>
<L>Et demptus per vim mentis grati&s;&s;imus error.</L></Q>
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
But, if the intere&s;ts of our literary &s;tate require it, it cannot be doubted that the mere gratification of an individual ought to be given up for the good of the whole community.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t head of our di&s;cour&s;e: the object of which is the effects or con|&s;equences of the following Review. The&s;e, like the &s;ubject of our preface, may be divided al&s;o into three parts. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, it is pre&s;umed the injuries done to the name of Shake&s;peare will be in a great mea&s;ure repaired, and the lu&s;tre of his tar|ni&s;hed honour re&s;tored. In the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> it is feared Dr. John&s;on will &s;uffer not a little in his literary re|putation; and in the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> it may be &s;u&s;pected, that the proprietors will be injured in the &s;ale of the work.</P>
<P>In regard to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; the plea&s;ure, which it is pre&s;umed every true Engli&s;hman will feel, at the attempt to do ju&s;tice to his favourite poet, will &s;uffi|ciently exculpate the author, had it been nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e a &s;till greater &s;everity in effecting it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> it may not be impro|per for the writer to offer &s;omething in his ju&s;tifica|tion. It is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s how far Dr. John&s;on would have the <HI>re&s;pect due to living reputation</HI> extend, when applied to him&s;elf. He may po&s;&s;ibly have adopted the opinion of Wolfius, and will plead the authority of that great civilian, to prove that men
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
of letters ought not to detract from the <HI>unmerited</HI> reputation of others. <HI>Nemo eruditorum alterius famae ac laudi, &s;ive meritae, &s;ive</HI> IMMERITAE <HI>detrahere debet.</HI> In reply to this, however, Mr. de Vattel, a civilian of equal authority, though perhaps of &s;omewhat le&s;s note, takes a different &s;ide of the que&s;tion; affirm|ing, that no per&s;on hath a ju&s;t complaint, becau&s;e we may deprive him of a thing to which he hath no right, and which he unju&s;tly a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf. On the other hand, he determines that the literary reputation which is gotten unde&s;ervedly, is injurious to men of true merit; who thus become &s;ufferers by the Vain and Unde&s;erving. When prai&s;e, continues this able civilian, is pro&s;tituted on unworthy objects, it lo&s;es its value: the world grows di&s;tru&s;tful, and in con&s;equence of being made the dupe of preten|ders, frequently refu&s;es to be&s;tow its applau&s;e on the truly Meritorious. Ought we to contribute to this inju&s;tice, for fear of depriving an impo&s;tor of the reputation on which he plumes him&s;elf, and to which he hath no well-founded preten&s;ions? Surely not! Such is the rea&s;oning of de Vattel on this intere&s;t|ing point; how far it is applicable to any, or all the editors of Shake&s;peare, the public is to determine. It is &s;ufficient that the Reviewer hath the civil law at lea&s;t on his &s;ide, in his endeavours to do ju&s;tice to merit; though he &s;hould be found to have de|tracted, more in effect than with de&s;ign, from the reputation of the Unde&s;erving. His con&s;cience is perfectly ea&s;y al&s;o, from the reflection that if he had not undertaken to expo&s;e the defects of Dr. John|&s;on's
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
work, &s;omebody el&s;e would. For, as Mr. Ed|wards ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,
<Q>the world will not long be impo&s;ed on by ungrounded pretences to learning, or any other qualification; nor does the knowledge of words alone, <HI>if it be really attained,</HI> make a man learned. Every true judge, as he ob&s;erves, will &s;ub|&s;cribe to Scaliger's opinion;</Q>
<Q>If, &s;ays that great Critic, a per&s;on's learning is to be judged of by his reading, no body can deny Eu&s;ebius the cha|racter of a learned man; but if he is to be e&s;teem|ed learned, who has &s;hewn judgment together with his reading, Eu&s;ebius is not &s;uch.</Q>
To this it may be truly added, in the words of another author, from whom this writer al&s;o borrowed them, as he u&s;ed them on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion;
<Q>It is not the purpo&s;e of the following remarks, to ca&s;t a blemi&s;h on his [Dr. John&s;on's] envied fame; but to do a piece of ju&s;tice to the real merit of the <HI>comment</HI> and the <HI>commentator</HI>; by that be&s;t and gentle&s;t method of correction, which nature has ordained in &s;uch a ca&s;e; of <HI>laughing them down</HI> to their proper rank and character.</Q></P>
<P>As to the la&s;t point, viz. the intere&s;t of the pro|prietors; the Reviewer thinks it very problematical whether this will be affected either way. He hath indeed known books &s;ometimes &s;ell the better for being publicly cen&s;ured: but, be this as it may, he can truly aver that he meant them no harm; for, though it is po&s;&s;ible that one or other of them may have &s;ometimes failed a little in that re&s;pect to the writer, which he thinks an author has a right to ex|pect
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
of his book&s;eller, and his book&s;eller, if he is wi&s;e, will be ready to pay him, yet he does not har|bour &s;o much re&s;entment again&s;t any of them, as to wi&s;h to hurt their intere&s;t. If unluckily it &s;hould turn out, however, that the &s;ale of Dr. John&s;on's edition of Shake&s;peare &s;hould be hence ob&s;tructed, and that it &s;hould only <HI>hobble,</HI> in&s;tead of taking a <HI>run</HI>; the proprietors have nothing to do, but to en|gage the Reviewer, if they can, or &s;ome body el&s;e, to furni&s;h them with a better edition. Nor will this be a difficult ta&s;k, although it would be an arduous and noble one, to give the public &s;uch a commen|tary as the writings of this incomparable Bard de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>To detain the reader but a moment longer.&mdash;Dr. John&s;on, having acted, in the outrage he hath committed on Shake&s;peare, ju&s;t like other &s;inners, not only by doing tho&s;e things he ought not to have done, but by leaving undone tho&s;e things he ought to have done; his &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion are not le&s;s im|portant, though much more numerous, than tho&s;e of commi&s;&s;ion. Indeed, nothing is more u&s;ual with commentators in general, than to di&s;play their own &s;agacity on obvious pa&s;&s;ages, and to leave the dif|ficult ones to be explained by the &s;agacity of their readers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. John&s;on, indeed, &s;ays, in his Preface:
<Q>Not a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt, which I have not attempted to re&s;tore; or ob&s;cure, which I have not en|deavoured to illu&s;trate.</Q>
How he hath &s;ucceeded in the&s;e at|tempts, the reader is left to judge for him&s;elf on peru&s;al of the following &s;heets.</P></NOTE>. The Reviewer, however, cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
here to have given a compleat commentary him&s;elf; indeed he hath been able only to include in the following &s;heets &s;ome few remarks on the mo&s;t glaring blunders and defects that occur in this new edition; of which &s;uch wonderful things were promi&s;ed and expected; and to which, having &s;een the prophecy fulfilled, we may apply, with as much ju&s;tice as ever it was applied to any thing, that well|known quotation from Horace.</P>

<Q>it is apparently defec|tive. Mr. Rowe (continues he) and Dr. Warburton, read <HI>that there is no &s;oul lo&s;t,</HI> without any notice of the variation. Mr. Theobald &s;ub&s;titutes <HI>no foil</HI>; and Mr. Pope follows him. To come &s;o near the right, and yet to mi&s;s it, is unlucky; the author probably wrote <HI>no &s;oil,</HI> no &s;tain, no &s;pot: for &s;o Ariel tells,

<P>Mr. Theobald is treated with no little &s;everity in the pre|face of the pre&s;ent editor, for pluming him&s;elf on his critical pe|netration in making &s;ome di&s;coveries that have e&s;caped others. Dr. John&s;on, however, gives him&s;elf an air of &s;uperiority in the above note, as exceptionable at lea&s;t as any of Theobald's; as will appear on the &s;lighte&s;t attention to the con&s;truction of the &s;entence; this pretended emendation, however plau|&s;ibly &s;upported, being in fact entirely groundle&s;s.&mdash;What can we under&s;tand by NO SOIL BETID <HI>to any creature in the ve&s;&s;el?</HI> Or if we can with difficulty &s;train out a meaning, is the &s;tile at all like that of Shake&s;peare; who&s;e attention to colloquial idiom is &s;o clo&s;e, that our language is more indebted, in this re&s;pect, to him than to any other writer; I had almo&s;t &s;aid, all other writers put together?&mdash;If the pa&s;&s;age is to be altered, let us at lea&s;t make <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of it: Shake&s;peare very probably wrote ILL; a word ea&s;ily corrupted by the tran&s;criber into <HI>&s;oul.</HI>

To <HI>betide</HI> is to befal, to happen to, to come to pa&s;s, to be|come of; and would here be very improperly u&s;ed with <HI>&s;oil</HI>; for even &s;uppo&s;ing there were no impropriety in &s;aying a <HI>&s;oil</HI> might <HI>betide a &s;uit of cloaths:</HI> no idiom will bear a <HI>&s;oil betiding to</HI> a <HI>creature,</HI> when its cloathing only was meant.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay to the &s;peeches of Ariel and Gon|zalo, that &s;eem to favour the <HI>emendation</HI> propo&s;ed?&mdash;What, indeed, but that they are little or nothing to the purpo&s;e!

<P>The note contained in this page is &s;o far a good one, as it is nece&s;&s;ary and proper to give the reader an idea of the &s;y&s;tem of enchantment, on which the plot and machinery of the play is conducted. I &s;hould therefore have pa&s;&s;ed it over as unexceptionable, had it come from any other pen than that of Dr. John&s;on. But as the world hath been plea&s;ed very publickly to impute &s;entiments to him, which &s;eem in|congruous with tho&s;e he here profe&s;&s;es, I cannot pa&s;s it over without &s;ome little animadver&s;ion. The incongruity I mean lies here: the Doctor, I have been frequently informed, very religiou&s;ly believes in the exi&s;tence of gho&s;ts and appari|tions; although he here &s;trongly in&s;inuates that there <HI>never</HI> was any &s;uch thing practi&s;ed as witchcraft. But if he believes the &s;tory of the witch of Endor, and that the gho&s;t of Sa|mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> appeared to Saul, as doubtle&s;s he does, he mu&s;t believe in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of witchcraft, and al&s;o in its power over de|parted &s;pirits. For, though &s;ome divines maintain that it was the devil who appeared in the form of Samuel, and not the gho&s;t of Samuel him&s;elf; yet, as Dr. John&s;on, in the note before us, adopts the di&s;tinction made by king James in his demonology, viz. that an <HI>enchanter is one who commands the devil, whereas the witch only &s;erves him,</HI> he cannot be al|lowed
<PB N="5" REF="20">
to &s;helter him&s;elf under the opinion of tho&s;e learned theologues. Either Dr. John&s;on therefore mu&s;t give up his faith in apparitions, or retract this part of his note.&mdash;But af|ter all, perhaps, I may have been mi&s;informed by the wicked wits of the times; for though it be true they do avouch &s;ome corroborating circum&s;tances, and advance &s;ome plau&s;ible pre|texts, I think I can di&s;cover &s;ome fallacy at the bottom. Our editor's favourite, Hooker, it is true, talks of &s;pirits di&s;per&s;ed up and down in caves and dens under the earth; and occa|&s;ion may hence be taken to give out, that the vi&s;it Dr. John&s;on once made to a certain cemetery was to confer with &s;ome of the&s;e &s;pirits. But in this the&s;e &s;uperficial witlings mu&s;t certainly be mi&s;taken; the &s;pirits mentioned by Hooker were &s;uppo&s;ed, as is here ob&s;erved, to be fallen angels. Hence, though I &s;hould be brought to believe, that our edi|tor did go from Cock-lane to Clerkenwell, to fulfil an ap|pointment with the gho&s;t of Fanny, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;|pect him of ever going there purpo&s;ely to meet the devil.</P>

it is at be&s;t a pleona&s;m, or a piece of tautology, for Ariel to &s;ay, they played tricks of de&s;peration, after he had &s;aid they were &s;eized with madne&s;s.

The commentators on Shake&s;peare are all very liberal in their declarations again&s;t the ungrammaticalne&s;s of his &s;tile.

<P>In an&s;wer to the odd que&s;tion propo&s;ed at the beginning of this note, I have only to &s;ay, as the editor &s;o frequently does, when he meets with difficulties, <HI>I know nothing of the matter.</HI> I have for &s;uch a <HI>why</HI> no <HI>wherefore.</HI> Nay, I know not that a wonderful &s;tory does produce &s;leep; unle&s;s it follows from a profound ob&s;ervation, which po&s;&s;ibly our editor may have made, that old women and children generally amu&s;e them&s;elves with relating wonderful &s;tories ju&s;t as they are going to bed. The editor believes, experience will prove that any violent agita|tion of the mind ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;ides in &s;lumber. Now, if he does not mean &s;imply by this, that when people are drow&s;y they cannot be violently agitated, I do believe, on the contrary, experi|ence will prove, that no <HI>violent</HI> agitation of the mind <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> &s;ub&s;ides at all. I have indeed heard of &s;omebody's being &s;o de&s;perately in love, as to fall into a profound lethargy; but I believe this too was only on the authority of &s;ome play-book, and much &s;uch another philo&s;opher as Miranda. But, &s;up|po&s;ing the fact to be true, what does the editor mean by a&s;k|ing &s;o &s;trange a que&s;tion? or what does he intend by his re|ply to it? Does he mean, for the credit of the poet, to account for Miranda's &s;leepine&s;s from natural cau&s;es? Shake&s;peare is, doubtle&s;s, much obliged to him; but in this our editor &s;eems rather too officious, as the poet hath taken care to inform us, that Pro&s;pero had cau&s;ed it by the power of inchantment: a cir|cum&s;tance

<L>Why &s;peaks my father &s;o urgently?</L>

<P><HI>Urgently</HI> for <HI>ungently.</HI> This is probably an error of the pre&s;s; as, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;tance above given of our editor's foi&s;ting in a <HI>thou,</HI> again&s;t all propriety of mea&s;ure, I think neither the emendation of &s;en&s;e, if any is aimed at, nor even the authority of copies, can ju&s;tify the breach of mea&s;ure here. And indeed, though it &s;hould be the mi&s;take of the printer, an editor, who is employed in <HI>literal</HI> and <HI>verbal</HI> critici&s;m, is inexcu&s;able for not cancelling the page wherein &s;uch errors occur. Yet the&s;e mi&s;takes &s;eem very frequently to happen in the pre&s;ent edition; thus, in page 6, Gonzalo is made to &s;ay
<Q><L>He'll be hang'd yet,</L>
<L>Though every drop of water &s;wear again&s;t it,</L>
<L>And <HI>gap</HI> at wid'&s;t to glut him.</L></Q>
All the other editions that I have &s;een, read <HI>gape</HI>; but perhaps our editor had &s;ome objection to a drop of water's <HI>gaping:</HI> but &s;urely it might <HI>gape,</HI> and even <HI>&s;wallow,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;wear.</HI> Or, perhaps, he thought every &s;ingle drop could never gape wide enough to take down a man-of-war's boat&s;wain; and therefore cho&s;e to read it quaintly <HI>gap</HI>; meaning that the drops &s;epa|rated from each other, and thereby made a gap for him in the &s;ea. By <HI>every drop,</HI> however, Shake&s;peare meant all the drops, or the water collectively. After all, it is not unlikely, as our editor has no note on this word, that he did not think
<PB N="9" REF="24">
at all about it, but left the text to the mercy of the printer.&mdash;Poor Shake&s;peare!</P>
<P>Again in this very play, page 77. <HI>than</HI> is printed for <HI>that,</HI> and in many other places, both in the text and in the notes, the&s;e errors occur, to the great injury of the &s;en&s;e; &s;o that one might be apt to think this edition (as Dr. John&s;on affirms of the old ones) was AT LAST <HI>printed without correction of the pre&s;s.</HI> It may be very true, as he al&s;o ob&s;erves, that
<Q>before the editor's art was applied to modern languages, our an|ce&s;tors were accu&s;tomed to &s;o much negligence of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> printers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hould refer my readers to the page of the preface, from whence this pa&s;&s;age is cited; but, behold, &s;uch is the accuracy of <HI>modern Briti&s;h</HI> printers! the preface is not <HI>paged</HI> at all.</NOTE>, that they could very patiently endure it.</Q>
But is it not rea&s;onably to be expected, Dr. John&s;on, that, &s;ince the editor's art hath been &s;o very <HI>&s;ucce&s;sfully</HI> applied to mo|dern languages, our printers &s;hould be a little more careful in correcting the pre&s;s? or that the editor him&s;elf &s;hould a little attend to this matter?</P>

<P>This note &s;erves to very little purpo&s;e in illu&s;trating the au|thor. It is a matter of no con&s;equence to the &s;pectator, whe|ther the king and his lords thought the &s;hip lo&s;t or not.
<PB N="10" REF="25">
They knew they mu&s;t be &s;omewhere in the Mediterranean. They were neither in the Atlantic ocean, nor the South-&s;ea, and could not be ca&s;t a&s;hore on Greenland, nor on Terra Au|&s;tralis incognita. And as they found the i&s;land plea&s;ant and temperate, and affording 'every thing advantageous to life,' it was no wonder if they did not at all de&s;pair of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting there, till they &s;hould find means to get back to Naples, even if their own ve&s;&s;el and all the fleet were wrecked and gone to the bottom. But, though this annotation doth not &s;erve to remove any difficulty, or di&s;play any merit in the author, it &s;ufficiently &s;erves to expo&s;e the incapacity of the annotator, for commenting on Shake&s;peare as a poet. He cannot &s;ee why Seba&s;tian &s;hould plot again&s;t his brother, unle&s;s he actu|ally knew how to find the kingdom he meant to inherit. But Seba&s;tian's plot was <HI>natural,</HI> even &s;uppo&s;ing there had been more rea&s;on for diffidence in this particular. This editor might as well a&s;k, why the chiefs of the rebellious party, in Henry the fourth, are made to quarrel about the divi&s;ion of the kingdom, before they are ma&s;ters of it, and that of a king|dom of which they never are ma&s;ters? Yet this is one of the fine&s;t &s;cenes in all Shake&s;peare, admirably repre&s;enting that anticipation of our wi&s;hes and expectations, which is daily ob&s;ervable in men of &s;anguine con&s;titutions, and is in&s;eparable from the human mind.

<P><HI>For he's a &s;pirit of per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c.] Of this entangled &s;entence I can draw no &s;en&s;e from the pre&s;ent reading, and therefore imagine that the author gave it thus:
<Q><L>For HE, a &s;pirit of per&s;ua&s;ion, only</L>
<L>Profe&s;&s;es to per&s;uade;</L></Q>

<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;eems here to have gotten <HI>a glimp&s;e</HI> (as he before &s;ays of another commentator) of the author's meaning, but <HI>can|not keep it.</HI> I wonder the word <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> in the preceding line, did not lead him quite into it. There is no nece&s;&s;ity for altering the text any farther than to tran&s;po&s;e the comma, placed after the word per&s;ua&s;ion, to the end of the line.

</SP></Q>
<P>The opinions of the commentators are &s;trangely divided about this elegant little &s;ong. Mr. Theobald reads, in the fir&s;t line, <HI>there lurk I</HI>; ob&s;erving that Ariel was a &s;pirit of a refined aethereal e&s;&s;ence, and could not be intended to want food. Be&s;ides, the &s;equent lines rather countenance <HI>lurk.</HI> For my part, I am apt to be of Mr. Theobald's opinion, for another rea&s;on; and that is, I think Ariel, though he &s;hould even be &s;uppo&s;ed to have occa&s;ion for more &s;ub&s;tantial food than the cameleon; yet he cannot mean to compare him&s;elf to a bee, or a &s;uckling of any kind. Mr. Theobald's read|ing is al&s;o more elegant; and yet our editor hath re&s;tored the old word <HI>&s;uck,</HI> without giving any rea&s;on for it.&mdash;A more material alteration hath been attempted on the la&s;t line; which Mr. Theobald, in his Shake&s;peare Re&s;tored, conceived &s;hould be written, <HI>After &s;un-&s;et merrily.</HI> This conjecture was countenanced by Mr. Pope, and adopted by Sir Thomas Hanmer: but Dr. Warburton rejected it with infinite di&s;dain. Dr. John&s;on al&s;o, having re&s;tored <HI>&s;ummer</HI> to the text, and quoted Warburton's note without any animadver&s;ion of his own, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in the force of what that learned commentator hath advanced; or at lea&s;t, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, to have nothing better to offer.&mdash;And yet no|thing, in my opinion, can be more inconclu&s;ive than the ar|gument contained in Dr. Warburton's annotation.&mdash;It will be thought, no doubt, a little pre&s;umptuous in &s;o petty an Ari&s;tarchus as my&s;elf, to attack conjointly two &s;uch gigantic and formidable critics. But I could not, with patience, &s;ee a Goliah treat the mu&s;e of Shake&s;peare like a common drab, at his plea&s;ure; my weapon, therefore, is quickly out,
<PB N="14" REF="29">
you &s;ee, for
<Q>I dare draw as &s;oon as another man, if I &s;ee oc|ca&s;ion, in a good quarrel, and the law of my &s;ide.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Warburton's note, as it is quoted by our editor, runs thus:</P>
<Q><HI>After &s;ummer, merrily.</HI>] This is the reading of all the editions: yet Mr. Theobald has &s;ub&s;tituted &s;un-&s;et, becau&s;e Ariel talks of riding on the bat in this expedition. An idle fancy. That circum&s;tance is given only to de&s;ign the time of night in which fairies travel. One would think the con|&s;ideration of the circum&s;tances &s;hould have &s;et him right. Ariel was a &s;pirit of great delicacy, bound, by the charms of Pro&s;pero, to a con&s;tant attendance on his occa&s;ions. So that he was confined to the i&s;land winter and &s;ummer. But the roughne&s;s of winter is repre&s;ented by Shake&s;peare as di&s;|agreeable to fairies, and &s;uch like delicate &s;pirits, who, on this account, con&s;tantly follow &s;ummer. Was not this then the mo&s;t agreeable circum&s;tance of Ariel's new reco|vered liberty, that he could now avoid winter, and follow &s;ummer quite round the globe? But, to put the matter out of que&s;tion, let us con&s;ider the meaning of this line,
<Q><L><HI>There</HI> I couch <HI>when</HI> owls do cry.</L></Q>
Where? in the <HI>cow&s;lip's bell</HI> and <HI>where the bee &s;ucks,</HI> he tells us: this mu&s;t needs be in <HI>&s;ummer.</HI> When? <HI>when owls cry,</HI> and this is in <HI>winter.</HI>
<Q><L>When blood is nipt, and ways be foul,</L>
<L>Then nightly &s;ings the &s;taring owl.</L>
<BIBL>LOVE's LABOUR LOST.</BIBL></Q>
The con&s;equence is, that Ariel flies after &s;ummer.</Q>
<P>Such is Dr. Warburton's elaborate annotation: in an&s;wer to which it may be ob&s;erved that, whether Theobald's rea|&s;oning be right or not, his own arguments are egregiou&s;ly wrong. I will admit, with Dr. Warburton, that Ariel here &s;peaks of him&s;elf as a kind of fairy; but, &s;uppo&s;ing no objec|tion to be made to the difference of climates, I do not know that Shake&s;peare hath any where repre&s;ented winter &s;o exce&s;|&s;ively di&s;agreeable to fairies, as to oblige them, like &s;wallows,
<PB N="15" REF="30">
to expatriate on the arrival of winter. The argument he makes u&s;e of, and the quotation he brings to put the matter out of que&s;tion, are in&s;ufficient, and are invalidated by many other pa&s;&s;ages in Shake&s;peare. He would infer from the two lines, quoted from the &s;ong in Love's Labour lo&s;t, that owls never cry but in <HI>winter.</HI> But the queen of the fairies, in the Mid-&s;ummer Night's Dream, &s;ays to her attendants,
<Q><L>&mdash;keep back</L>
<L>The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders</L>
<L>At our quaint Spirits.</L></Q>
And again, Puck, at the latter end of the &s;ame play, &s;ays,
<Q><L>Now the wa&s;ted brands do glow,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t the &s;critch-owl, &s;hrieking loud,</L>
<L>Puts the wretch that lies in woe,</L>
<L>In remembrance of a &s;hroud.</L></Q>
Thus we &s;ee that the owls do cry, even in the pre&s;ence of the fairies. It may not be ami&s;s al&s;o to remark, that in the &s;ong of <HI>Winter,</HI> the owl is repre&s;ented as <HI>&s;inging a merry note</HI>; whereas, in the other pa&s;&s;ages, &s;he is &s;aid to <HI>cry,</HI> to be <HI>clamo|rous:</HI> which it might with great propriety be &s;aid to do in &s;ummer, when her hooting is contra&s;ted
<Q><L>To the night-warbling bird, that now, awake,</L>
<L>Tunes &s;weete&s;t his love-labour'd &s;ong&mdash;</L></Q>
A circum&s;tance that does not operate to the owl's di&s;advan|tage in the cold and dreary nights of winter, when the &s;ame hooting may even have &s;omething chearful in it; at lea&s;t to tho&s;e who are &s;itting by a good fire in the chimney-corner: <HI>While grea&s;y Joan doth keel the pot.</HI> As to what Dr. Warburton &s;ays about following <HI>&s;ummer</HI> quite round the globe, I never be|fore heard that <HI>&s;ummer</HI> it&s;elf went round the globe. That it vibrates from pole to pole is certain: but there is &s;ome little difference between that motion of the earth which cau&s;es &s;um|mer and winter, and that which cau&s;es day and night.</P>
<P>In regard to Dr. Warburton's calling Theobald's rea&s;on, for altering the text, <HI>an idle fancy,</HI> and his telling us, that the
<PB N="16" REF="31">
circum&s;tance of the bat is only introduced to de&s;ign the time of night in which fairies <HI>travel</HI>; I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Ariel does not &s;eem to be one of tho&s;e kind of fairies, that, as Puck &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;run</L>
<L>By the triple Hecat's team,</L>
<L>From the pre&s;ence of the &s;un,</L>
<L>Following darkne&s;s like a dream.</L></Q>
On the contrary, he appears to execute the commands of Pro&s;pero by day-light. Nor is this incon&s;i&s;tent with his cha|racter, as a fairy of a &s;uperior kind. For thus, Oberon, the fairy king, on Puck's telling him of the approach of morn|ing, which ha&s;tens away tho&s;e &s;pirits that <HI>for aye con&s;ort with black-brow'd night,</HI> replies;
<Q><L>But we are &s;pirits of another &s;ort;</L>
<L>I with the morning light have oft made &s;port;</L>
<L>And, like a fore&s;ter, the groves may tread,</L>
<L>Ev'n till the ea&s;tern gate, all fiery-red,</L>

<L>As from a voyage rich with merchandize.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton, and our editor, have both attempted to illu|&s;trate this pa&s;&s;age, without &s;ucce&s;s. The difficulty lies in the &s;ixth, &s;eventh and eighth lines. Dr. Warburton &s;ays,
<Q>Fol|lowing what? &s;he did not follow the &s;hip, who&s;e motion &s;he imitated; for that &s;ailed on the water, &s;he on the land. If by <HI>following</HI> we are to under&s;tand <HI>imitating,</HI> it will be a mere pleona&s;m&mdash;<HI>imitating would imitate.</HI> From the poet's de&s;cription of the actions it plainly appears we &s;hould read
<Q><L>FOLLYING&mdash;</L>
<L>Would imitate.</L></Q>
<PB N="18" REF="33">
i. e. wantoning in &s;port and gaiety. Thus the old Engli&s;h writers&mdash;and they beleeven FOLYLY and <HI>fal&s;ely</HI>&mdash;&s;ays Sir J. Mandeville, from and in the &s;en&s;e of <HI>fol&acirc;trer,</HI> to play the wanton. This exactly agrees to the action de&s;cribed.&mdash;<HI>full often has &s;he go&s;&s;ipt by my &s;ide</HI>&mdash;and&mdash;<HI>when we have laughed to &s;ee.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This note, Dr. John&s;on tells us, is very ingenious; but, continues he,
<Q>&s;ince <HI>follying</HI> is a word of which I know not any example; and the fairy's favourite might, without much licentiou&s;ne&s;s of language, be &s;aid to <HI>follow</HI> a &s;hip that &s;ailed in the direction of the coa&s;t, I think there is no &s;ufficient rea&s;on for adopting it. The coinage of new words is a vio|lent remedy, not to be u&s;ed but in the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>I will not di&s;pute with our editor the ingenuity of Dr. War|burton's note, or that of his own; but it is certainly an in|genuity of a different kind to that which is nece&s;&s;ary to illu|&s;trate Shake&s;peare. The former of the&s;e gentlemen, I re|member, affected to ridicule the book&s;ellers for believing a &s;illy maxim, that none but a <HI>poet &s;hould pre&s;ume to meddle with a poet.</HI> The event, however, hath proved this maxim to have &s;ome truth in it. If either Dr. Warburton, or Dr. John|&s;on, had, in critici&s;ing this pa&s;&s;age, exerci&s;ed their ingenuity as poets, in&s;tead of their ingenuity as philologers, I am per|&s;uaded they would have &s;oon di&s;covered its meaning. But they were too intent upon <HI>words,</HI> to attend to the <HI>images</HI> de|&s;igned to be conveyed by them. The former talks of an ac|tion de&s;cribed in two lines, wherein nothing is &s;poken of but <HI>go&s;&s;ipping</HI> and <HI>laughing.</HI> Do the&s;e imitate a &s;hip under &s;ail? To have been merely playful and wanton, is not the imitation here mentioned: nor does it con&s;i&s;t in merely <HI>following</HI> the ob|ject imitated, as Dr. John&s;on conceives; for &s;he did not only &s;ail upon land, in the &s;ame direction along the coa&s;t as the &s;hips did in the &s;ea; but &s;he <HI>returned</HI> again, which mu&s;t have been in a different direction. So that it appears neither of the&s;e <HI>ingenious</HI> critics had any idea of the poetical beauty of this pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;I &s;hall endeavour to explain it, therefore, by a very
<PB N="19" REF="34">
different mode of inve&s;tigation.&mdash;If the reader hath ever &s;een a &s;hip &s;cudding before the wind, with its fore-&s;ail grown <HI>big-bellied,</HI> as the poet expre&s;&s;es it, with the &s;welling breeze; he mu&s;t recollect that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the &s;ail projects &s;o far for|ward, that it &s;eems, to a &s;pectator on &s;hore, to go in a man|ner <HI>before</HI> the re&s;t of the ve&s;&s;el; which, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, appears to <HI>follow,</HI> though clo&s;ely, <HI>after,</HI> with an ea&s;y, &s;wim|ming motion.&mdash;This was the moving image, which the fairy's favourite, taking the hint from, and the advantage of, her pregnancy, endeavoured to imitate; and this &s;he did, by wantonly di&s;playing before her the convexity of her &s;welling belly, and moving after it, as the poet de&s;cribes,
<Q>&mdash;with pretty and with &s;wimming gate.</Q>
Such being the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, the text is ea&s;ily a&s;cer|tained, by pointing and reading thus;
<Q><L>Which &s;he, with pretty and with &s;wimming gate</L>
<L>Following her womb, then rich with my young &s;quire,</L>
<L>Would imitate.</L></Q>
This is the method a critic &s;hould take with the poets. Trace out their images, and you will &s;oon find how they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, without perplexing your&s;elf either about the meaning of antiquated words, or the coinage of new ones.</P>

<P>Had our editor nothing to offer better than this? And hath he &s;o little veneration for Shake&s;peare, as &s;o readily to coun|tenance the charge again&s;t him of writing non&s;en&s;e? Did you, Dr. John&s;on, ever read the &s;cene, wherein this pa&s;&s;age occurs, quite through? I could almo&s;t venture to affirm, that neither you nor Dr. Warburton ever could have read it through with any attention. It &s;eems to me morally impo&s;&s;ible, if you had, that <HI>he</HI> could have made &s;o egregious a mi&s;take, or <HI>you</HI> have admitted it among your notes.&mdash;Shake&s;peare mo&s;t undoubtedly wrote it HEAR, as it &s;tands in the text. For not to in&s;i&s;t upon the palpable defects of Dr. Warburton's ex|planation, the mo&s;t undoubted evidence in ju&s;tification of this
<PB N="22" REF="37">
reading, may be deduced from the context. In the preceding page the wall makes a &s;peech, on which The&s;eus &s;ays, <HI>Would you de&s;ire lime and hair to &s;peak better?</HI> and Demetrius an&s;wers, <HI>It is the wittie&s;t partition that ever I heard di&s;cour&s;e.</HI> On this Pyramus enters and clo&s;es his &s;peech with a cur&s;e again&s;t the wall. His &s;peech ending with the words <HI>deceiving me.</HI> Upon which The&s;eus again thus remarks,
<Q>The wall, methinks, being &s;en&s;ible, &s;hould cur&s;e again.</Q>
<HI>No,</HI> &s;ays the actor who play'd Pyramus, <HI>in truth, Sir, he &s;hould not.</HI> DECEIVING ME, <HI>is</HI> Thi&s;be<HI>'s cue; &s;he is to enter, and I am to &s;py her through the wall. You &s;hall &s;ee, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder &s;he comes.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Pyramus and Thi&s;be having met and &s;pied each other through the crevice, for which purpo&s;e only the wall was in|troduced, their interview is no &s;ooner over than the actor who played the <HI>wall,</HI> apparently, without waiting for his cue, as no body &s;peaks to him, and he &s;peaks to no per&s;on in the drama, &s;ays,
<Q><L>Thus have I, <HI>wall,</HI> my part di&s;charged &s;o;</L>
<L>And, being done, thus <HI>wall</HI> away doth go.</L></Q>
On which The&s;eus ob&s;erves again, as in the pa&s;&s;age cited,
<Q>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.</Q>

That the expre&s;&s;ion, how|ever, may bear a reference to &s;ome latent meaning, I do not deny; and po&s;&s;ibly it may refer to a cu&s;tom practi&s;ed by the magi&s;trates in many places abroad, of &s;ticking up a notice or warning on the walls of ruinated and untenanted hou&s;es, for the owners either to repair or pull them quite down.</P></NOTE>, <HI>my lord, when walls are &s;o wilful, to</HI> HEAR <HI>without</HI> WARNING.

<P>Dr. Warburton &s;ays,
<Q>This <HI>non&s;en&s;e</HI> mu&s;t be corrected thus; <HI>with &s;pecial roll:</HI> i. e. by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion.</Q>
The pre|&s;ent editor, Dr. John&s;on, thinks Warburton right in &s;uppo&s;ing a corruption, but le&s;s happy in his emendation. He reads, therefore, with <HI>&s;pecial &s;eal</HI>; which, he &s;ays, is a very natural metonymy for a <HI>&s;pecial</HI> commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But why did not our editor obviate the objection made again&s;t this &s;uppo&s;ition of a corruption, by the author of the Canons of Critici&s;m? Was his objection of too little weight, or was the writer of too little con&s;equence to need a refutation? This author re|marks on this pa&s;&s;age, that
<Q>with &s;pecial <HI>&s;oul,</HI> may fairly be interpreted to mean, with great thought, upon mature deliberation; but that with &s;pecial <HI>roll,</HI> for&mdash;by &s;pecial <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> is har&s;h and aukward; and to <HI>elect</HI> a man by a com|mi&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of&mdash;<HI>appoint</HI> him, is flat <HI>non&s;en&s;e.</HI></Q>
Now, this objection lies equally again&s;t Dr. John&s;on's reading as again&s;t Dr. Warburton's, and mu&s;t be removed before I with|draw my <HI>caveat</HI> again&s;t any innovation being made in the text. Indeed I will oppo&s;e, <HI>totis viribus,</HI> the admi&s;&s;ion of Dr. John&s;on's <HI>&s;eal,</HI> le&s;t &s;ome future commentator &s;hould &s;tart up, and affirm that, although to <HI>elect by</HI> or <HI>with a commi&s;&s;ion</HI> may be non&s;en&s;e; yet to ERECT <HI>by</HI> or <HI>with</HI> a commi&s;&s;ion is &s;en&s;e; <HI>to erect</HI> here meaning nothing more than to <HI>&s;et up,</HI> to <HI>promote,</HI> which is done by <HI>commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> And how plau&s;ibly might not &s;uch an annotator maintain, that &s;uch reading would be per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with the context?</P>
<Q><L>For you mu&s;t know, we have with &s;pecial &s;eal</L>

<L>El&s;e let my brother die,</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to have confounded all the commentators. Dr. Warburton makes the following curious and learned note upon it.
<Q>This is &s;o ob&s;cure a pa&s;&s;age, but &s;o fine in its ap|plication, that it de&s;erves to be explained. A feodary was one that, in the times of va&s;&s;alage, held lands of the chief lord, under the tenure of paying rent and &s;ervice, which te|nures were called <HI>feuda</HI> among&s;t the Goths. Now, &s;ays An|gelo, <HI>we are all frail</HI>; yes, replies I&s;abella, <HI>if all mankind were not feodaries, who owe what they are to this tenure of imbe|cility, and who &s;ucceed each other by the &s;ame tenure, as well as my brother, I would give him up.</HI> The comparing mankind, lying under the weight of original &s;in, to a feodary, who owes &s;uit and &s;ervice to his lord, is, I think, not ill-ima|gined.</Q>
&mdash;This note, with little variation, is in&s;erted in Theobald's edition; who &s;ays it explains one of the mo&s;t beautiful allu&s;ions imaginable.&mdash;The pre&s;ent editor in&s;erts this note al&s;o, without any remark of his own. He ob&s;erves indeed, that to <HI>owe</HI> means in this place to <HI>own,</HI> to <HI>hold,</HI> to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;For my part, I never could reconcile the words of this pa&s;&s;age, by any mode of con&s;truction, to the &s;en&s;e here put on it. Indeed, it never appeared to me, from
<PB N="25" REF="40">
the tenour of the conver&s;ation, that I&s;abel could po&s;&s;ibly en|tertain &s;uch a con&s;trained and far-fetched allu&s;ion, as the in|genious Dr. Warburton hath here fi&s;hed out for her. I con|ceive her meaning to be much more &s;imple, and if the reader ob&s;erves the connection of this &s;peech with tho&s;e of Angelo that precede and follow, I doubt not but he will be of my opinion. It is true, that to <HI>owe</HI> means here, as in other parts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly in the Tempe&s;t; where Pro&s;pero &s;ays to Fer|dinand,
<Q><L>&mdash;Thou do&s;t here u&s;urp</L>

Taking the words in this, their true &s;en&s;e, let us &s;ee if we cannot, without forcing their con&s;truction, di&s;cover a mean|ing more in character with the &s;peaker, and therefore more likely to be intended by Shake&s;peare:

That is,
<Q>Let my brother die, if not one of his companions, if only he, of all his &s;ex, is frail, and hath &s;ucceeded in his attempts on women, by taking advantage of a like frailty in them.</Q>
&mdash;That this is the true &s;en&s;e, I think, is put pa&s;t di&s;pute by the &s;ub&s;equent &s;peech of Angelo; who takes occa|&s;ion, from the la&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of I&s;abel, to &s;ay
<Q>Nay, <HI>women</HI> are frail <HI>TOO.</HI></Q>

<L>&mdash;Rea&s;on thus with life;</L>
<L>If I do lo&s;e thee, I do lo&s;e a thing</L>
<L>That none but fools would keep:</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton, in order, I pre&s;ume, to lay hold of an oc|ca&s;ion for altering the text, excepts again&s;t this pa&s;&s;age, as being a direct per&s;ua&s;ive to <HI>&s;uicide.</HI> The ab&s;urdity, however, of &s;uppo&s;ing that the &s;peaker intended it as &s;uch, is obvious, &s;ince he is endeavouring to in&s;til into a condemned pri&s;oner a re&s;ignation to his &s;entence. Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves, that the meaning &s;eems plainly this, that
<Q>none but fools would wi&s;h to keep li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; or, none but fools would keep it, if choice were allowed.</Q>
A &s;en&s;e which, whether true or not, he re|marks, is certainly innocent. But though our editor is gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to exculpate Shake&s;peare in this particular, it appears to be only that he may fall upon him with the greater violence in a page or two after; where Dr. Warburton vouch|&s;afes to pay the poet a compliment. This pa&s;&s;age is in the &s;ame &s;peech as the foregoing;
<Q><L>&mdash;Thy be&s;t of re&s;t is &s;leep,</L>
<L>And that thou oft provok'&s;t; yet gro&s;ly fear'&s;t</L>
<L>Thy death, which is no more.</L></Q>
This pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays Dr. Warburton,
<Q>is evidently taken from
<PB N="27" REF="42">
the following, of Cicero: <HI>Habes &s;omnum imaginem mortis, eamque quotidie induis, &amp; dubitas quin &s;en&s;us in morte nullus &s;it, cum in ejus &s;imulachro videas e&s;&s;e nullum &s;en&s;um.</HI> But the Epicurean in&s;inuation is with great judgment omitted in the imitation.</Q>
On this note Dr. John&s;on hath made the fol|lowing remark:
<Q>Here Dr. Warburton might have found a &s;entiment worthy of his animadver&s;ion. I cannot, without indignation, find Shake&s;peare &s;aying, that <HI>death is only &s;leep,</HI> lengthening out his exhortation by a &s;entence which in the friar is impious, in the rea&s;oner is fooli&s;h, and in the poet is trite and vulgar.</Q>
&mdash;Nor can I, Dr. John&s;on, without equal indignation, find you mi&s;repre&s;enting Shake&s;peare, and thence taking occa&s;ion to condemn him for what he is not culpable; lengthening out your cen&s;ure with imputations that, being fal&s;e in them&s;elves, appear as invidious in the <HI>man,</HI> as they are contemptible in the <HI>critic.</HI> Would not one imagine, from the warmth with which Dr. John&s;on &s;peaks of this pa&s;|&s;age, that it militates again&s;t the doctrine of the immortality of the &s;oul; in&s;inuating that in death we clo&s;e our eyes, and &s;leep for ever?&mdash;Nothing, however, can be more foreign from the plain intent of the &s;peaker, and the obvious meaning of the pa&s;&s;age. The duke, in the a&s;&s;umed character of a friar, is endeavouring to per&s;uade Claudio to acquie&s;ce in the &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed on him, and to prepare him&s;elf for launching into eternity. To this end he advi&s;es him to think altogether on death; and to excite him to do &s;o, he enume|rates the &s;everal foibles of humanity, and the calamities in|cident to human life; evidently intending by this means to wean his affections from the world, and render him le&s;s aver&s;e to part with it, and le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of the pain of dying. <HI>Thou oft provoke&s;t &s;leep,</HI> &s;ays he, yet ab&s;urdly fear to die; which, with regard to the painful and perplexing vigil of life, is only to go to &s;leep. For that he only &s;peaks of the mere <HI>&s;en&s;e of death,</HI> the parting of the &s;oul from the body, and that Claudio under&s;tood him &s;o, is very evident, by the reply which the latter makes to his harangue; notwith&s;tanding the very
<PB N="28" REF="43">
la&s;t words of it &s;eem to be full as exceptionable as tho&s;e ob|jected to.
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>

<L>I humbly thank you.</L>
<L>To &s;ue to live, I find, I &s;eek to die;</L>
<L>And, &s;eeking death, find <HI>life:</HI> let it come on.</L>
</SP></Q>
If any thing further be nece&s;&s;ary to corroborate what is here ad|vanced, we might in&s;tance the duke's exhorting him, in &s;cene III. of the &s;ame act, <HI>to go to his knees</HI> and prepare for death. It is highly incon&s;i&s;tent to think &s;uch a piece of advice &s;hould come from one who conceived death to be a perpetual &s;leep. Prayers mu&s;t &s;eem as &s;uperfluous to him, as the advice mu&s;t appear impertinent to the pri&s;oner. But that Claudio had the &s;tronge&s;t notions of a future &s;tate after death is not to be doubted, &s;ince, &s;peaking of the &s;in of debauching his &s;i&s;ter, and An|gelo's de&s;ign to commit it, he &s;ays
<Q><L>If it were damnable, he being &s;o wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Why would he for the <HI>momentary</HI> trick</L>
<L>Be <HI>perdurably</HI> fin'd?</L></Q>
Again, when his fears recurring, he tells his &s;i&s;ter that
<Q>Death is a fearful thing,</Q>
it is plain, he doth not confine the meaning of the word, as the Duke did, to the mere act or circum&s;tance of dying. For when &s;he retorts upon him,
<Q>And &s;hamed life a hateful,</Q>
he goes on,
<Q>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where.</Q>
As if he had &s;aid, I do not mean the mere pain of dying; it is what is to come after death that I fear, when we are to
<Q><L>&mdash;go we know not where;</L>
<L>To lie in cold ob&s;truction, and to rot;</L>
<L>This &s;en&s;ible warm motion to become</L>
<L>A kneeded clod; and the delighted &s;pirit</L>
<L>To bathe in fiery floods, or to re&s;ide</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="44">In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice:</L>

Can we think that Shake&s;peare could &s;o far forget him&s;elf, as to be here &s;o very explicit regarding the notion of a future &s;tate, if but two or three pages before he had been inculcating a contrary doctrine!&mdash;What then mu&s;t we think of his commentator, who affects to be moved with indignation, and in effect pre&s;umes to charge him on this account with vulgarity, folly and impiety!

<Q>I leave the public to judge, &s;ays that &s;en&s;ible critic, which has been engaged <HI>again&s;t</HI> Shake|&s;peare, Mr. Warburton or I, who have in part at lea&s;t vindicated that be&s;t of poets from the wor&s;t of critics; from one, who has been guilty of a greater violation of him, than that of the authors on which he imprecated vengeance in his epitaph. A violation which, were he not armed again&s;t the &s;uper&s;tition of believing in portents and prodigies, might make him dread the apparition of that injured bard.</Q>
&mdash;Here we &s;ee the murder comes out: Dr. Warburton, it is true, was not only armed again&s;t the &s;uper&s;tition
<PB N="30" REF="45">of believing in gho&s;ts, by his principles as a <HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> but al&s;o again&s;t their doing him hurt, by the awful power annexed to his &s;acred functions and character as a <HI>prie&s;t.</HI> But this is not the ca&s;e with Dr. John&s;on, who&s;e religion and philo&s;ophy put together, it &s;eems, cannot &s;ecure him again&s;t the terrors of &s;uch &s;uper&s;tition: &s;o that, as I before ob&s;erved, here the &s;ecret comes out; and we &s;ee the rea&s;on for his &s;itting up all night, and lying a-bed all day, for fear of apparitions&mdash;It is not &s;o much from his fear of gho&s;ts in ge|neral, (for we know he did not appear to be afraid of Fanny) but of the gho&s;t of Shake&s;peare, who&s;e fame he is con&s;cious of having inhumanly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and who&s;e violated mu&s;e cries aloud for vengeance again&s;t him.</P>

<L>Oh, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</L>
<L>The damned'&s;t body to inve&s;t and cover</L>
<L>In princely <HI>guards.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The &s;tupid editors, &s;ays Dr. Warburton (who&s;e note in this pa&s;&s;age Dr. John&s;on hath quoted) mi&s;taking <HI>guards</HI> for &s;atellites, whereas it here &s;ignifies <HI>lace,</HI> altered PRIESTLY, in both places, to PRINCELY. Whereas Shake&s;peare wrote it <HI>prie&s;tly,</HI> as appears from the words them&s;elves,
<Q><L>&mdash;'tis the cunning <HI>livery</HI> of hell,</L>
<L>The damned'&s;t body to inve&s;t and cover</L>
<L>With PRIESTLY guards.</L></Q>
In the fir&s;t place we &s;ee, that <HI>guards</HI> here &s;ignify <HI>lace,</HI> as referring to <HI>livery,</HI> and as having no &s;en&s;e in the &s;ignifica|tion of <HI>&s;atellites.</HI> Now <HI>prie&s;tly guards</HI> means <HI>&s;anctity,</HI> which is the &s;en&s;e required. But <HI>princely guards</HI> means nothing but <HI>rich lace,</HI> which is a &s;en&s;e the pa&s;&s;age will not bear. <HI>Angelo,</HI> indeed, as <HI>deputy,</HI> might be called the <HI>princely An|gelo</HI>; but not in this place, where the immediately pre|ceding words of, This <HI>outward-&s;ainted</HI> deputy, demand the reading I have re&s;tored.</P></Q>
To this very curious argument of Dr. Warburton's, the pre&s;ent editor only adds the follow|ing note.</P>
<P><Q>The fir&s;t folio has, in both places, <HI>prenzie,</HI> from which the other folios made <HI>princely,</HI> and every editor may make what he can.</Q></P>
<P>It is really very kind of Dr. John&s;on to give <HI>others</HI> leave to make SOMETHING of what he can make NOTHING <HI>him&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;Let us &s;ee, therefore, what others <HI>have made</HI> of it.&mdash;The author of the Canons of Critici&s;m objects to Dr. Warbur|ton's emendation; ob&s;erving that,
<Q>if <HI>princely guards</HI> means nothing but <HI>rich lace,</HI> he &s;hould be glad to know how <HI>prie&s;tly guards</HI> &s;hould come to &s;ignify any thing more than <HI>black lace?</HI></Q>
&mdash;The author of the Revi&s;al of Shake&s;peare's Text, goes &s;till farther, and &s;ays,
<Q>We &s;hould undoubtedly
<PB N="32" REF="47">
re&s;tore the ancient reading in both places, the <HI>princely</HI> An|gelo, and in <HI>princely</HI> guards. Nothing [&s;ays he] can be weaker and more de&s;titute of all foundation, than Mr. War|burton's critici&s;m. Angelo is repre&s;ented as &s;upporting the &s;tate of a prince, and the authority of government, by exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity; but there is not the lea&s;t hint [given] in the whole play of his affecting a &s;anctified exterior, or &s;etting up for a devotee.</Q>
<HI>Prie&s;tly guards,</HI> we are told,
<Q>means &s;anctity;</Q>
but how the body could be inve&s;ted or covered
<Q>with &s;anctity, Mr. Warburton hath not thought proper to explain; for I pre&s;ume he doth not imagine that he wore the prie&s;tly habit, to which he could be no way en|titled, as appears by his marriage afterwards, as well as from many other circum&s;tances needle&s;s to enumerate.</Q>
<Q>In princely guards,</Q>
mo&s;t certainly &s;ignifies in a habit adorned "as becomes a prince."</P>
<P>If it be thought nece&s;&s;ary to add any thing to the&s;e re|marks; it may be ob&s;erved, that the word <HI>guards</HI> is not &s;trictly confined to mean <HI>lace,</HI> as Dr. Warburton in&s;inuates; but is u&s;ed for ornaments of dre&s;s, or finery in general. Thus Shake&s;peare, in &s;ome other of his plays, I think it is in Love's Labour Lo&s;t, &s;peaks of the <HI>guards of Cupid's ho&s;e</HI>; in all pro|bability meaning the clocks of his &s;tockings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am well aware that our ance&s;tors, wearing long ho&s;e, &s;ometimes included their breeches too under that denomination; but I cannot &s;uppo&s;e this part of the dre&s;s would be particularly &s;pecified, if <HI>lace</HI> merely was intended, unle&s;s Cupid might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have worn laced breeches without having a laced coat.</P></NOTE>; which could not with propriety be called <HI>lace.</HI> Dr. Warburton, indeed, thinks the word <HI>livery,</HI> in this &s;entence, fixes that of <HI>guards</HI> to mere <HI>lace,</HI> becau&s;e, it is true, mo&s;t liveries are laced. It does not, however, follow that <HI>lace</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to a <HI>livery,</HI> or that a livery might not be given to &s;ervants without any lace in the trimming of it: for the word <HI>livery</HI> comes either from the French <HI>livr&eacute;e,</HI> of <HI>livrer,</HI> to deliver or give; or from the Italian <HI>livrea,</HI> or the Spani&s;h <HI>librea,</HI> all having the &s;ame
<PB N="33" REF="48">
meaning; &s;o that a &s;uit of cloaths, with trimmings of a dif|ferent colour, given to a &s;ervant, is as much a <HI>livery,</HI> as if it were covered with <HI>lace.</HI> Again, to come nearer the point, can we &s;uppo&s;e that when Ba&s;&s;anio, in the Merchant of Ve|nice, commands his followers to give Launcelot
<Q><L>&mdash;a livery</L>
<L>More <HI>guarded</HI> than his fellows:</L></Q>
he means particularly that it &s;hould have more <HI>lace</HI> on it? No, &s;urely, he only means that it &s;hould, on the whole, be more fine and gaudy.</P>
<P>The meaning of the words thus &s;ettled, it is with great propriety I&s;abel calls the princely badges and ducal finery of Angelo the <HI>cunning</HI> LIVERY <HI>of hell</HI>; as being <HI>given</HI> him in order that he might the more effectually &s;erve its abhorred and damnable purpo&s;es.</P>

<SPEAKER>LUCIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is there none of Pigmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket, and extracting it clutched?</P>
</SP></Q>
<P><PB N="34" REF="49">Dr. Warburton &s;ays, the meaning of this pa&s;&s;age is,
<Q>Are there no women come out cured from a &s;alivation?</Q>
And this explanation is implicitly adopted by Dr. John&s;on. The author of the Revi&s;al, however, &s;uppo&s;es the meaning of this very affected cant to be,
<Q>Are there no fre&s;h women, no maidenheads to be had now? For (continues the Re|vi&s;er, very gravely) Pigmalion's &s;tatue newly made woman, was certainly a pure virgin.</Q>
&mdash;Now, not to controvert the virginity of a marble &s;tatue, or to query how long it re|mained &s;o, when converted into fle&s;h and blood, in the hands of
<Q><L>Pig (what do ye call him) malion</L>
<L>That long'd to u&s;e her like a &s;tallion.</L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cotton's Virgil trave&s;tie.</NOTE></Q>
I conceive the&s;e &s;cholia&s;ts to be all mi&s;taken with regard to the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age. It is perfectly agreeable to the cha|racter of Lucio, to call an innocent <HI>uncome-at-able</HI> virgin a Pigmalion's &s;tatue; nor could he with any propriety give that name to a pro&s;titute, either under a &s;alivation, or newly come out of it. What he meant, therefore, by Pigmalion's images newly made women, was young girls newly de|bauched. The deflowering a maid is frequently called, by dramatic writers, the <HI>making a woman</HI> of her. Again, I think it pretty evident that Lucio is too well acquainted with rogues and bawds, too deep in "the trick of it," not to know that maidenheads were commodities they &s;eldom dealt in. On the other hand, I think it as plain that Lucio did not a&s;k after &s;uch battered brims as might be ju&s;t come out of the powdering tub: for when the clown tells him his mi|&s;tre&s;s is her&s;elf in that &s;ituation, he &s;ays, <HI>'Tis good; it is the right of it; it mu&s;t be &s;o. Ever your</HI> FRESH <HI>whore, and your powder'd bawd: an un&s;hunn'd con&s;equence: it mu&s;t be &s;o.</HI>&mdash;I fancy Lucio would be apt to think &s;uch pickled devils as came out of the powdering tub, <HI>&s;ound</HI> as they po&s;&s;ibly might be, too <HI>&s;tale</HI> to be called <HI>fre&s;h</HI> meat.</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="50">IBID.&mdash;What reply? Ha! what &s;ay'&s;t thou to this tune, matter and method? is't not drown'd i'th' la&s;t reign? Ha! what &s;ay'&s;t thou, trot?</Q>
<P><Q>This &s;trange non&s;en&s;e (&s;ays Dr. Warburton) &s;hould be thus corrected, IT's <HI>not</HI> DOWN <HI>i'th' la&s;t</HI> REIGN. <HI>i. e.</HI> the&s;e are &s;everities unknown to the old duke's time. And this is to the purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Very much to the purpo&s;e truly! and &s;o the ingenious au|thor of the Canons of Critici&s;m hath &s;hewn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Canons of Critici&s;m, page 25.</NOTE>; notwith&s;tand|ing which, our editor, without taking the lea&s;t notice of what Mr. Edwards has advanced, proceeds thus.
<Q>Dr. Warbur|ton's emendation is ingenious; but I know not whether the &s;en&s;e may not be re&s;tored with le&s;s change. Let us con&s;ider it. Lucio, a prating fop, meets his old friend going to pri|&s;on, and pours out upon him his impertinent interrogatories: to which, when the poor fellow makes no an&s;wer, he adds, <HI>What reply? Ha! what &s;ay'&s;t thou to this? tune, matter and method&mdash;is't not! drown'd i'th' la&s;t rain? ha? what &s;ay'&s;t thou, trot?</HI> &amp;c. It is a common phra&s;e u&s;ed in low raillery of a man cre&s;t-fallen and dejected, that <HI>he looks like a drown'd puppy.</HI> Lucio, therefore a&s;ks him whether he was drowned in the la&s;t rain, and therefore cannot &s;peak?</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on's explanation of this pa&s;&s;age is, in my opinion, le&s;s clear and much le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with his own pointing than that given by Mr. Edwards. Indeed the latter &s;uppo&s;es Pom|pey's an&s;wer only to be drowned in the la&s;t rain [a prover|bial phra&s;e, he &s;ays, to expre&s;s a thing which is lo&s;t, or ra|ther not to be found]; whereas Dr. John&s;on &s;uppo&s;es that Pompey him&s;elf is taxed with having been drowned in the la&s;t rain. Taking their own authority, however, for the u&s;e of their proverbs, Mr. Edwards's explanation is not half &s;o far-fetched as Dr. John&s;on's. It is, indeed, a &s;trange round-about kind of &s;alutation, to a&s;k a man whether or not
<PB N="36" REF="51">
he was drowned in the la&s;t rain; becau&s;e, truly, he looks dejected, and therefore may be phra&s;eologically compared to a drown'd puppy?</P>
<P>Dr. Gray would make a farther emendation of the text, in this pa&s;&s;age, of which our editor hath made mention in his appendix; but &s;eems to di&s;approve it. The Doctor propo&s;es that, in&s;tead of reading <HI>what &s;ay'&s;t thou, trot?</HI> we &s;hould read, <HI>what &s;ay'&s;t thou to't?</HI> the word <HI>trot</HI> being &s;eldom, if ever, u&s;ed to a man.&mdash;To this Dr. John&s;on replies,
<Q><HI>Trot,</HI> or as it is now often pronounced <HI>hone&s;t trout,</HI> is a familiar addre&s;s to a man among the provincial vulgar.</Q>
Now, it appears to me, although I think Dr. Gray's emendation very admi&s;&s;ible, that Lucio might very probably here mean to give Pompey an appellation u&s;ually given to women, by way of gibing him for following &s;o &s;candalous an employment as that of a bawd, u&s;ually practi&s;ed by wretches of that &s;ex. But be this as it may, I think nobody can he&s;itate about Dr. John&s;on's being in the wrong, when he &s;uppo&s;es that Lucio might call Pom|pey Bum, the cock-bawd, HONEST <HI>trout.&mdash;Trout!</HI> indeed! Dr. John&s;on &s;urely mu&s;t imagine his readers to be very <HI>gud|geons,</HI> to bait his hook with &s;uch grubs, as the&s;e grub-&s;treet annotations!</P>
<P>Vol. I. pages 329 and 330. are in&s;erted two notes from Dr. Warburton, without any remark of the editor's; notwith|&s;tanding they are both &s;ufficiently refuted and exploded in the Canons of Critici&s;m, pages 25 and 26.

<P>Double and treble admonition, and &s;till forfeit in the &s;ame kind! this would make Mercy &s;wear, and play the tyrant.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>I doubt not but my readers have already ob&s;erved that, when Dr. John&s;on's &s;entiments coincide with Dr. Warbur|ton's,
<PB N="37" REF="52">
he does not chu&s;e to hazard them for his own; as he does when they agree with tho&s;e of Edwards, and &s;ome others. But, for fear they &s;hould be wrong, he takes advan|tage of the <HI>verbum &s;acerdotis,</HI> and &s;kulks behind the name of WARBURTON. This he does with regard to the pa&s;&s;age now before us; and yet if I &s;hould admit a &s;ingle emendation of all tho&s;e Dr. Warburton propo&s;es, I believe it would be this; and yet I don't approve of it. But the ca&s;e is, I as little ap|prove of what is advanced by others in favour of the pre&s;ent reading, and yet, as Dr. John&s;on &s;ays, nothing better &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf. Dr. Warburton &s;ays,
<Q>We &s;hould read SWERVE, i. e. deviate from her nature. The common reading gives us the idea of a ranting whore.</Q>
In oppo&s;ition to this, the author of the Revi&s;al &s;ays, the common reading is
<Q>agreeable to a very common form of expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>This would make a &s;aint &s;wear,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;es it means no more than that the exce&s;s of the provocation would get the better of the mild di&s;po&s;ition even of Mercy her&s;elf, and put her in a pa&s;&s;ion.</Q>
In an&s;wer again to this, however, it may be ob&s;erved, that we have no &s;uch <HI>very common</HI> form of &s;peech as is here a&s;|&s;erted. Nay, I don't know that we can po&s;&s;ibly have occa|&s;ion for &s;uch a form. Make a <HI>&s;aint</HI> &s;wear! Pray where are there any &s;aints now-a-days to be met with? For my part, I never conver&s;ed with any but fictitious ones. I have heard, indeed, of things being provoking enough <HI>to make a</HI> PARSON <HI>&s;wear,</HI> and that even in the middle of his &s;ermon. But alas! alas! there is a great difference between <HI>&s;aints</HI> and <HI>par&s;ons</HI>; though I hope the author of the Revi&s;al is too hone&s;t a man wilfully to impo&s;e a par&s;on on his readers for a &s;aint.&mdash;The true &s;tate of the ca&s;e appears to me to be as follows: the poet did not intend, or at lea&s;t did not effect, a compleat per&s;onification of Mercy. If he had, he would not have given us the idea of a ranting whore, as Dr. Warburton ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;es it; nor would he have repre&s;ented Mercy as &s;tripped of her attributes, or put in a pa&s;&s;ion, as the Revi&s;er
<PB N="38" REF="53">
has it.&mdash;It &s;eems to me that E&s;calus &s;peaks of that mercy, or merciful di&s;po&s;ition, exi&s;ting in his own brea&s;t, agreeable, and in reply, to what the bawd had &s;aid to him in the pre|ceding &s;peech. <HI>Your honour is accounted a</HI> MERCIFUL <HI>man.</HI> To which he an&s;wers,
<Q>Yes, but &s;uch provocation would make me, merciful as I am, &s;wear and play the tyrant.</Q>
To this it may be objected, that E&s;calus repre&s;ents him&s;elf in this ca&s;e as a ranting bully, ju&s;t as Mercy, in the other, gives the idea of a ranting whore. So that, perhaps, after all, we had better abide by the literal con&s;truction of the text, and &s;uppo&s;e the pro&s;opopeia compleat; in which ca&s;e to <HI>&s;wear</HI> mu&s;t mean to make a vow never to be moved by pleas or in|terce&s;&s;ion; to be <HI>unrelenting,</HI> being one of the principal cha|racteri&s;tics of a tyrant.</P>

<P>A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully, but as a drunken &s;leep; carele&s;s, reckle&s;s and fearle&s;s of what's pa&s;t, pre&s;ent or to come; in&s;en&s;ible of mortality, and de&s;perately mortal.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P><HI>De&s;perately mortal.</HI>] This expre&s;&s;ion is ob&s;cure. Sir Thomas Hanmer reads <HI>mortally de&s;perate.

<P>I wi&s;h Dr. John&s;on, every time he had dictated any of the articles of his critical creed, had given us a rea&s;on for the faith that is in him. Why he &s;hould believe Barnardine to be de&s;perately <HI>mi&s;chievous,</HI> I cannot po&s;&s;ibly conceive. The Provo&s;t &s;eems to give him a very different character: <HI>He hath evermore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>had the liberty of the pri&s;on: give him leave to e&s;cape hence, he would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk.

<PB N="39" REF="54">
<HI>de&s;perately mortal,</HI> means totally incurable of di&s;ea&s;es, acquired by his bea&s;tly cour&s;e of life; or el&s;e that, de&s;pairing or care|le&s;s of life, he looks upon him&s;elf as dead to the world, and takes no thought of what becomes of him.

</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. John&s;on hath here in&s;erted the word <HI>convented,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>convened,</HI> which was the common reading. <HI>Convented,</HI> indeed, was the reading of the fir&s;t folio, which Dr. Warburton in|&s;i&s;ts upon to be right <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And yet Dr. Warburton, as the author of the Revi&s;al &s;hrewdly remarks, calls that edition, on another occa&s;ion,
<Q>the old blun|dering folio.</Q></NOTE>, giving his rea&s;ons for it in the fol|lowing arrogant and fooli&s;h note, which is as impertinently and fillily adopted by our editor.
<Q>The fir&s;t folio reads <HI>con|vented,</HI> and this is right; for to <HI>convene</HI> &s;ignifies to a&s;&s;em|ble; but <HI>convent,</HI> to cite or &s;ummons. Yet, becau&s;e <HI>con|vented</HI> hurts the mea&s;ure, the Oxford editor &s;ticks to <HI>convened,</HI> though it be <HI>non&s;en&s;e,</HI> and &s;ignifies, <HI>whenever he is a&s;&s;embled together.</HI> But thus it will be, when the author is thinking of one thing, and his critic of another. The poet was at|tentive to his &s;en&s;e, and the editor, quite throughout his
<PB N="40" REF="55">
performance, to nothing but the mea&s;ure; which Shake&s;|peare having entirely neglected, like all the dramatic writers of that age, he has &s;pruced him up with all the exactne&s;s of a modern mea&s;urer of &s;yllables.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know how either Dr. Warburton or Dr. John&s;on came to know that Shake&s;peare <HI>entirely neglected mea&s;ure?</HI> Shake&s;peare had a poetical ear; and though he might not &s;tand to count his fingers, as probably the&s;e gentle|men do when they write ver&s;es, he wrote in general much more melodiou&s;ly than any of the dramatic writers of his own age, or perhaps of the pre&s;ent. The Oxford editor did very wi&s;ely, therefore, in abiding by the mea&s;ure, as he could do it without any injury to the &s;en&s;e. For to <HI>convene,</HI> as the au|thor of the Revi&s;al ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, means not only to <HI>a&s;&s;emble together,</HI> but to <HI>cite</HI> or <HI>cau&s;e to appear</HI>; and is rendered in Latin by <HI>cito, cieo.</HI>&mdash;To this I may add al&s;o, that <HI>cito</HI> does not mean &s;imply to <HI>cite</HI> or <HI>&s;ummons</HI> in general, but al&s;o to &s;um|mons or produce as a witne&s;s, exactly agreeable to the ca&s;e before us.

<P>Our editor appears to know very little of the provincial cu&s;|toms and manners of his countrymen. He would el&s;e, I think, hardly have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of being obliged to Dr. Gray, and recurring back two or three centuries for the beggar's <HI>clack-di&s;h</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. page 331. al&s;o Dr. John&s;on's appendix, vol.

Again, Dr. John&s;on is equally at a lo&s;s with re&s;pect to the pa&s;&s;age before us. He hath not omitted, however, to di&s;play Dr. Warburton's eru|dition and &s;agacity on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Stand like the forfeits in a barber's &s;hop.</HI>] Barbers &s;hops were, at all times, the re&s;ort of idle people.

and mi&s;u&s;ing them. To remedy which, I &s;uppo&s;e, there was placed up again&s;t the wall a table of forfeitures, adapted to every offence of this kind; which, it is not likely, would long pre&s;erve its authority.</Q></P>
<P>Such is Dr. Warburton's explanation of this pa&s;&s;age; which, our editor &s;ays, may &s;erve till a better is di&s;covered. He ob|&s;erves, neverthele&s;s, that
<Q>whoever has &s;een the in&s;truments of a chirurgeon, knows that they may be very ea&s;ily kept out of improper hands in a very &s;mall box, or in his pocket.</Q>
&mdash;The truth is, that the tables of forfeits, hung up in barbers &s;hops, are &s;till extant in &s;ome parts of Eng|land; at lea&s;t I remember to have &s;een one about twelve or thirteen years ago, in an excur&s;ion from Burlington to North-Allerton in York&s;hire. I think it was either at Malton or at Thir&s;k, and very probably it is there &s;till. I do not, indeed, recollect the name of the operator, in who&s;e &s;hop it was affixed; but its contents &s;truck me &s;o much on reading, that I believe I can recite them from memory pretty exactly. They do not relate, however, to the handling of chirurgical in&s;truments, but to civility and good behaviour; and &s;eem not injudiciou&s;ly calculated for a place, where per&s;ons of dif|ferent &s;tations and degrees were accu&s;tomed to meet, in order to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;haved.

<SPEAKER>LUCIO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you &s;o, Sir? and was the duke a fle&s;h-monger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, who &s;eems con&s;tantly on the watch to catch Shake&s;peare tripping, ob&s;erves here, that
<Q>Lucio had not, in the former conver&s;ation, mentioned <HI>cowardice</HI> among the faults of the duke.</Q>
But, &s;ays he, very graciou&s;ly,
<Q>&s;uch failures of memory are incident to writers more diligent than this poet.</Q>
&mdash;On this occa&s;ion, I cannot help remark|ing, that it is &s;omewhat &s;ingular to find our editor &s;o extremely remi&s;s and negligent in illu&s;trating the beauties of Shake&s;peare, and &s;o very diligent in di&s;covering his faults. This carping critic is in this particular, however, egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken; there being no grounds for charging the poet, in this place, with want of attention to his plot. It is true, that Lucio does not expre&s;ly call the duke a coward, in that part of their conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;tage, in &s;cene VI. act 3. Our editor might have ob&s;erved, however, that he hath a farther conver&s;ation with him in &s;cene XI. act 4. where he begins again to talk of the <HI>old fanta&s;tical duke of dark corners</HI>; and when the duke wants to &s;hake him off, by bidding him farewel, and telling him his <HI>company is fairer than hone&s;t,</HI> Lucio will not be thus got rid of, but follows him, &s;aying, <HI>By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of bur, I &s;hall &s;tick.</HI> Is it not very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that Lucio might afterwards call the duke a <HI>coward,</HI> con&s;idering the many opprobrious names he had already given him? and is the poet to be cen&s;ured, becau&s;e he hath made the Duke charge Lucio with a &s;ingle word of detraction, which was not actu|ally &s;poken before the audience? If this be not hypercritici&s;m, I know not what is. But, to make the matter wor&s;e on the part of our unfortunate editor, the Duke doth not charge
<PB N="45" REF="60">
Lucio with calling him a coward, at the time when he runs on enumerating his other vices. For this was in the open &s;treet, through which the officers pa&s;&s;ed in carrying the bawds to pri&s;on: but the time is particularly &s;pecified when he called him <HI>coward,</HI> which was when the duke met him in the pri|&s;on, and, as I above remarked, could not get rid of him. This is plain from the context.</P>

<L>Look, if it plea&s;e you, on this man condemn'd,</L>

<L>A due &s;incerity govern'd his deeds</L>
<L>Till he did look on me; &s;ince it is &s;o,</L>
<L>Let him not die.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. John&s;on hath, in my opinion, a very exceptionable note on this pa&s;&s;age. I &s;hall quote it therefore entire, and make my ob&s;ervations on it afterwards.
<Q>The duke has ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved, that I&s;abel is <HI>importuned, again&s;t all &s;en&s;e,</HI> to &s;olicit for Angelo; yet here, <HI>again&s;t all &s;en&s;e,</HI> &s;he &s;olicits for him. Her argument is extraordinary.
<Q><L>A due &s;incerity govern'd his deeds,</L>
<L>'Till he did look on me; &s;ince it is &s;o,</L>
<L>Let him not die.</L></Q>
That Angelo had committed all the crimes charged again&s;t him, as far as he could commit them, is evident. The only <HI>intent</HI> which <HI>his act did not overtake,</HI> was the defile|ment of I&s;abel. Of this Angelo was only intentionally guilty.&mdash;Angelo's crimes were &s;uch, as mu&s;t &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify puni&s;hment, whether its end be to &s;ecure the inno|cent from wrong, or to deter guilt by example; and I be|lieve every reader feels &s;ome indignation when he finds him &s;pared. From what extenuation of his crime can I&s;a|bel, who yet &s;uppo&s;es her brother dead, form any plea in his favour? <HI>Since he was good till he look'd on me, let him not die.</HI> I am afraid our varlet poet intended to inculcate, that women think ill of nothing that rai&s;es the credit of their beauty, and are ready, however virtuous, to pardon any act which they think incited by their own charms.</Q></P>
<P>To expo&s;e the &s;everal fallacies &s;ugge&s;ted throughout the above note, I &s;hall ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that it was very natural for Mariana to &s;olicit I&s;abel's interce&s;&s;ion for her hu&s;band, the man &s;he &s;o much loved. I cannot think al&s;o, that it is, in
<PB N="47" REF="62">
any re&s;pect, out of character for I&s;abel, after repeated &s;olici|tations, to be moved to oblige Mariana, who had already obliged her, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to prevent the apparent nece&s;|&s;ity of pro&s;tituting her&s;elf to Angelo: e&s;pecially if we reflect on the tranquil &s;tate of mind &s;he &s;eems to be in with regard to her brother; in who&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed death &s;he appears to have acquie&s;ced, either from principles of religion or philo&s;ophy: for when the Duke, in the foregoing page, &s;peaking of her brother, &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;Peace be with him!</L>
<L>That life is better life, pa&s;t fearing death,</L>
<L>Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort.</L>
<L>So, happy is your brother.</L></Q>
I&s;abel an&s;wers,
<Q>I do, my lord.</Q>
From a principle of philo&s;ophy, &s;he mu&s;t be very con&s;cious that the death of Angelo could not bring her brother to life again; and if to this reflection we &s;uppo&s;e her religion might add the &s;ugge&s;tion of Chri&s;tian charity and forgivene&s;s, I do not &s;ee any impropriety in I&s;abel's &s;oliciting Angelo's pardon.</P>
<P>As to the argument &s;he makes u&s;e of, and which Dr. John|&s;on thinks &s;o very extraordinary, it is to be ob&s;erved, that &s;he does not make u&s;e of it as a po&s;itive plea, but introduces it with
<Q><L>&mdash;I PARTLY THINK</L>
<L>A due &s;incerity, &amp;c.</L></Q>
Again, Dr. John&s;on &s;ays,
<Q>the only <HI>intent</HI> which <HI>his act did not overtake,</HI> was the defilement of I&s;abel.</Q>
Surely, Dr. John|&s;on forgets the intended execution of Claudio! There is no doubt that Angelo's guilty intentions fully de&s;erved puni&s;h|ment; but as the principal of them failed of being carried into execution, I do not &s;ee why the reader &s;hould feel &s;o much indignation at his being pardoned, e&s;pecially as he mu&s;t perceive the propriety of doing poetical ju&s;tice to the injured Mariana; which would not be the ca&s;e, if her new-made
<PB N="48" REF="63">
hu&s;band were to be immediately puni&s;hed with the &s;everity due to his wicked de&s;igns.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ini&s;ter meaning he imputes to the poet, of in|tending a covert &s;atire on the fair &s;ex, I think enough is al|ready &s;aid to exculpate him; I wi&s;h, therefore, Dr. John&s;on were equally excu&s;able for giving Shake&s;peare the appellation of <HI>varlet</HI> poet. Our editor can hardly intend here to confine that term to its &s;imple and ancient meaning: for where is the je&s;t or propriety of calling Shake&s;peare a yeoman, or &s;ervant, agreeably to the old meaning of the word <HI>varlet</HI>; which like <HI>fur,</HI> in Latin, it is allowed, originally conveyed no ba&s;e or opprobrious idea?&mdash;And yet, if Dr. John&s;on did not u&s;e the word in this limited and antiquated &s;en&s;e, what can he mean by calling Shake&s;peare a mean, &s;orry, or ra&s;cally poet? For this is the modern &s;en&s;e of the word; and in this &s;en&s;e the word <HI>varletry</HI> is in&s;erted in a certain folio dictionary, on the authority of Shake&s;peare him&s;elf.&mdash;Perhaps, indeed, Dr. John|&s;on only meant here to expre&s;s him&s;elf in a &s;train of wit and plea&s;antry. If &s;o, let him beware how he attempts to be witty again: for &s;urely never was &s;uch an aukward attempt made before! It is not in his nature.</P>

</SP></Q>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age hath given the commentators a world of trou|ble. It &s;eems generally agreed, that Mr. Theobald's ex|planation is &s;till more inexplicable than the text it&s;elf. Dr. John&s;on in&s;erts it, however; for what rea&s;on I cannot divine, unle&s;s it be to &s;well his book, or to &s;erve as a foil to the &s;u|perior &s;agacity of Dr. Warburton and him&s;elf, who&s;e notes immediately follow. I &s;hall only quote tho&s;e of the two latter.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Which doth offer to &s;wear upon a book.</HI>] This non&s;en&s;e &s;eems to have taken its ri&s;e from the accident of a lo&s;t line in tran|&s;cribing the play for the pre&s;s; &s;o that the pa&s;&s;age, for the future, &s;hould be printed thus: <HI>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, which doth * * * * * offer to &s;wear upon a book I &s;hall have good fortune.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to find, again, the lo&s;t line; but the lo&s;t &s;en&s;e is ea&s;y enough&mdash;<HI>if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth</HI> [promi&s;e good luck, I am mi&s;taken. I dur&s;t almo&s;t] <HI>offer to &s;wear upon a book, I &s;hall have good fortune.</HI></Q>
Dr. John&s;on, after condemning Theobald's note in the &s;evere&s;t terms, and informing us that by <HI>table</HI> is meant the palm expanded, goes on very magi&s;te|rially thus.&mdash;
<Q>Dr. Warburton under&s;tood the word<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A mighty matter to under&s;tand truly! which is familiar to every &s;trolling gyp&s;y, and as well known to every kitchen-wench who can make &s;hift to &s;pell the Egyptian Fortune teller, Palmi&s;try laid open, or the two-penny Chiromancer.</NOTE>, but
<PB N="50" REF="65">
puzzles him&s;elf, with no great &s;ucce&s;s, in pur&s;uit of the meaning.</Q>
&mdash;No wonder at that Dr. John&s;on! people &s;eldom <HI>puzzle</HI> them&s;elves with any <HI>great &s;ucce&s;s</HI> in pur&s;uit of any thing.&mdash;But to proceed with our editor's note.
<Q>The whole matter is this: Launcelot congratulates him&s;elf upon his dexterity and good fortune; and, in the height of his rap|ture, in&s;pects his hand, and congratulates him&s;elf upon the felicities in his table. The act of expounding his hand, puts him in mind of the action in which the palm is &s;hewn, by rai&s;ing it to lay it on the book, in judicial atte&s;tations. <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays he, if any man in Italy have a fairer table, that doth offer to &s;wear upon a book&mdash;here he &s;tops with an abruptne&s;s very common, and proceeds to particulars.</Q>
&mdash;No, Sir, he doth not &s;top here; but goes on, agreeable to Dr. Warburton's explanation, to &s;ay what is to be &s;worn upon the book, i. e. that he &s;hall have good fortune. But this is not to be &s;worn either by Launcelot him&s;elf, or by any other Italian. It is the hand it&s;elf that promi&s;es &s;o &s;trongly, and, as it were, offers to &s;wear upon a book, that he &s;hall have good fortune. And in this &s;en&s;e the author of the Revi&s;al takes it; though I think he has not hit off the meaning quite happily. His interpretation is,
<Q>If any man in Italy have a fairer table, which pronounces that I &s;hall have good fortune, with as much a&s;&s;urance as if it was ready to &s;wear it upon a book.&mdash;Here, &s;ays he, the &s;entence breaks off, and we mu&s;t &s;upply, <HI>I am mi&s;taken,</HI> or &s;ome other expre&s;&s;ion of like import.</Q>
&mdash;None of the&s;e commentators, though very &s;en&s;ible of the break in this pa&s;&s;age, &s;eem to know where it lies; but if I might be allowed to take the mo&s;t trifling liberty in the world with the text, I dare &s;ay the reader would &s;ee the whole meaning and propriety of it, at one view.&mdash;<HI>Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer ta|ble!&mdash;Why, it doth offer to &s;wear upon a book, I &s;hall have good fortune.&mdash;Go to, &amp;c.</HI> Taking the words, al&s;o, in this &s;en&s;e, there is a beauty and propriety in &s;aying the palm of|fers to &s;wear upon a book; becau&s;e, in judicial atte&s;tations,
<PB N="51" REF="66">
the e&s;&s;ential part of the form lies in <HI>ki&s;&s;ing</HI> the book, which the hand may not be improperly &s;aid to do, even in laying hold of it. Dr. John&s;on, apparently having a con|fu&s;ed idea of a court of ju&s;tice in his head, confounds the action of a criminal holding up his hand at the bar, with that of a witne&s;s, qualifying him&s;elf by oath, to give evidence again&s;t him. The former, indeed, mu&s;t of cour&s;e di&s;play the palm; but I believe the latter &s;eldom or never does.</P>

<P><Q><L>Bellario, a learned doctor,</L>
<L>Whom I have &s;ent for.&mdash;</L></Q> The doctor and court are here &s;omewhat un&s;kilfully brought together. That the duke would, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, con&s;ult a doctor of great reputa|tion, is not unlikely; but how &s;hould this be foreknown by Portia?</P></Q>
<P>Why will you, Dr. John&s;on, be thus con&s;tantly &s;eeking oc|ca&s;ion to find fault with Shake&s;peare, for mi&s;conduct in his drama; the bu&s;ine&s;s of which you are evidently much too <HI>un|&s;killed</HI> in to have a right to take upon you the authority of cen&s;uring the <HI>foremo&s;t man of all this world?</HI>&mdash;You admit it to be right that Dr. Bellario, whom we may very well &s;up|po&s;e to be a civilian of the fir&s;t rank, &s;hould be &s;ent for, to
<PB N="52" REF="67">
advi&s;e in this cau&s;e. You know too, I imagine (or at lea&s;t you might have known, if you had read the play) that this &s;ame Dr. Bellario (for he was a doctor too; WE are all doc|tors, Dr. John&s;on) was a relation, a cou&s;in, to Portia. This being premi&s;ed, is it not very natural to &s;uppo&s;e that, after Ba&s;&s;anio was called away in &s;uch ha&s;te to Venice, on account of the pro&s;ecution carried on again&s;t his friend Anthonio, his bride Portia would &s;end a me&s;&s;enger to her cou&s;in Bellario, in order to a&s;k his opinion of &s;o extraordinary a ca&s;e, or to in|tere&s;t him in Anthonio's behalf? And can any thing be more probable than that he &s;hould inform her, on receiving &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, that he was actually &s;ent for to Venice on that very account? For it is to be ob&s;erved, that the duke &s;peaks as if he had &s;ent for him &s;ome con&s;iderable time before: for he &s;ays, <HI>unle&s;s Bellario,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>come here to</HI> DAY. His power of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the court al&s;o, on his not coming, &s;eems founded on &s;ome phy&s;ical or moral impediment, that might very naturally occur, to prevent his arrival within the time: &s;o that he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed either at &s;uch a di&s;tance as made it nece&s;&s;ary to give him a con&s;iderable timely warning, or that the extra|ordinary nature of the cau&s;e might make him require &s;o much the more time to prepare him&s;elf equitably to determine it.&mdash;This being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, was not here a very apt foundation on which to build Portia's plot of officiating for the doctor? which de&s;ign &s;he no doubt concerted with him by letter, before &s;he &s;ent for the notes and cloaths mentioned &s;cene V. act III. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that I have known &s;ome &s;pectators impute the device, by which Anthonio evades the penalty of the bond, to the ingenuity of Portia.&mdash;Perhaps this is the ca&s;e, indeed, with the audience in general.&mdash;But, as I think it a little out of character, in a young lady of her education, to be &s;o well ver&s;ed in the quirks and quibbles of the law; &s;o I conceive there is &s;ufficient rea&s;on given in the play to &s;uppo&s;e that eva&s;ion to have been &s;ugge&s;ted by Bellario.&mdash;For &s;he expre&s;ly mentions to the me&s;&s;enger <HI>notes</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">aths.</HI> The&s;e notes were, doubtle&s;s, the brief or hints for her pleading. And Bellario &s;ays in his letter to the
<PB N="53" REF="68">duke, &s;peaking of the fictitious doctor,
<Q>he is furni&s;hed with my opinion.</Q>
So that I am &s;o far from thinking that Shake&s;peare, as Dr. John&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, repre&s;ents Portia to be a prophete&s;s, or a witch, that I conceive his readers in general are apt to think her much more &s;hrewd than he de&s;cribes her; at lea&s;t, I dare &s;ay, Dr. John&s;on's readers will conclude, from this &s;pecimen of his &s;agacity, that whether Portia was a witch or not, he is no conjurer.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="67"></NOTE>&mdash;And that this was really the ca&s;e &s;eems
<PB N="53" REF="68">
evident, from what Portia &s;ays to Je&s;&s;ica, <HI>during</HI> the <HI>ab&s;ence</HI> of Ba&s;&s;anio, and <HI>before</HI> &s;he &s;ends Balthazar to Bellario for the notes and clothes.&mdash;Je&s;&s;ica compliments her on
<Q><L>&mdash;a noble and a true conceit</L>
<L>Of god-like amity; which appears mo&s;t &s;trongly</L>
<L>In bearing thus the ab&s;ence of her lord.</L></Q>
A &s;ufficient intimation, I think, that Ba&s;&s;anio mu&s;t have been gone &s;ome time. Again, in Portia's reply to this compli|ment, &s;he &s;ays
<Q><L>&mdash;this Anthonio,</L>
<L>Being the bo&s;om-lover of my lord,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t needs be like my lord. If it be &s;o,</L>
<L>How little is the co&s;t I have be&s;towed,</L>
<L>In purcha&s;ing the &s;emblance of my &s;oul</L>
<L>From out the &s;tate of helli&s;h cruelty?</L></Q>
Here we find Portia &s;peaking very peremptorily and certainly of Anthonio's deliverance; and of the co&s;t already be&s;towed to effect it. Is it rea&s;onable to think &s;he would expre&s;s her&s;elf thus confidently on a mere &s;ugge&s;tion of her own? Be&s;ides, what co&s;t could &s;he have be&s;towed? Her having bid her hu&s;|band pay the bond three times over, was nothing; becau&s;e &s;he could not be &s;ure the money would be taken. Nay, &s;he evidently does not intend to tru&s;t to that acceptance. It is therefore, I think, very evident, that &s;he had even at this time concerted the &s;cheme with her cou&s;in Bellario. How far Belmont might be from either Venice or Padua, I cannot ex|actly &s;ay: but it appears from circum&s;tances, that it could not be very far. From Belmont to Venice it &s;eems there was a common traject, or ferry; &s;o that the di&s;tance of both from Padua could not be too great for tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="54" REF="69">
in que&s;tion.&mdash;It is true, that the formality with which Port a introduces her charge to Balthazar, when &s;he &s;ends him for the notes and cloaths, &s;eems to favour the &s;uppo&s;ition, that this was the fir&s;t time &s;he had &s;ent to Bellario, in which ca&s;e there would be &s;ome grounds for Dr. John&s;on's remark; but we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Balthazar is now to be intru&s;ted with a more important charge than he had before been, in merely carrying and bringing back a letter; or, it is not unlikely, that Portia entru&s;ted that bu&s;ine&s;s with a &s;ervant of le&s;s im|portance. All the&s;e things duly con&s;idered, it is plain, I think, that Dr. John&s;on has very ra&s;hly and unadvi&s;edly pre|&s;umed to call Shake&s;peare <HI>un&s;kilful,</HI> becau&s;e he wanted <HI>&s;kill</HI> him&s;elf. I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this note, therefore, with advi&s;ing our editor never to wade &s;o far out of his depth for the fu|ture. It is a trite adage, but it is a very good one, and worthy to be ob&s;erved; <HI>Ne &s;utor ultra crepidam.</HI> I do not &s;ay that Dr. John&s;on may not probably be well &s;killed in <HI>&s;ome</HI> things; not that <HI>I know</HI> that he is well &s;killed in any <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will except indeed the article of <HI>literary compo&s;ition</HI>; in which, &s;o far as the merit of a &s;peech, an e&s;&s;ay, a life, or a novel, goes, he is undoubtedly the be&s;t writer in Chri&s;tendom. But his merit even here is in a great mea&s;ure mechanical, and may be ju&s;tly ac|counted for in a manner that will do little honour either to his boa&s;ted genius or learning.</NOTE>; for, though I have read <HI>all</HI> his <HI>works,</HI> I declare he does not appear to me (at lea&s;t &s;o far as I my&s;elf am able to judge) to be <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of any <HI>one &s;cience,</HI> or any <HI>one language,</HI> &s;o that he mu&s;t not plume him&s;elf on <HI>my</HI> &s;uffrage. Not that I <HI>deny</HI> him to be ma&s;ter of the <HI>whole circle of &s;ciences,</HI> and of <HI>all languages an|cient and modern.</HI> But, if it <HI>be</HI> &s;o; if it be really <HI>true,</HI> as his friends inform me, that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch amazing &s;tores of literary and &s;cientific knowledge, I cannot help thinking him extremely culpable, not to &s;ay very ungrateful, to keep them all avariciou&s;ly to him&s;elf, and fob off the public with mere &s;hreds and patches. How <HI>dare</HI> Dr. John&s;on treat <HI>that public</HI> with &s;o much <HI>contempt,</HI> which hath done <HI>him</HI> &s;uch extravagant
<PB N="55" REF="70">
<HI>honour?</HI> How dare he behave to that public with &s;uch im|paralell'd ingratitude, which hath given him &s;uch imparalell'd, &s;uch avowed, &s;uch unmerited encouragement?&mdash;It is true, that its having done all this is &s;ufficient to give Dr. John&s;on a very mean opinion of its &s;pirit, ta&s;te and judgment. But he &s;hould have been aware of carrying the impo&s;ition too far; he &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to think that this public, ta&s;te|le&s;s and ignorant as he may &s;uppo&s;e it, could ever be pre|vailed on to grace his waving noddle with a wreath, irreve|rently torn from the brows of Shake&s;peare!</P>
<P>The &s;elf-&s;ufficient, the arrogant, Dr. John&s;on may po&s;&s;ibly conceive, that the zeal, with which the very name of Shake|&s;peare in&s;pires me, is counterfeited; and that I expre&s;s my&s;elf thus warmly, to provoke him to a reply.&mdash;No, Dr. John|&s;on, you <HI>cannot reply.</HI> I mu&s;t join in that deference, which I think the world hath unde&s;ervedly paid you, &s;o far as to own, that I &s;hould never have pre&s;umed to publi&s;h any thing again&s;t Dr. John&s;on, that I had not good rea&s;on to think UNANSWERABLE. It is indeed prudential in <HI>you</HI> to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and previou&s;ly to give out, that you <HI>will</HI> not do what you have &s;o much rea&s;on to think you <HI>can</HI> not do.&mdash;Yet you have your &s;atellites, your light-troops; you may &s;end them out to <HI>harra&s;s</HI> the enemy whom you <HI>dare</HI> not <HI>encounter.</HI> But, as I am no farther your enemy than as you are Shake&s;peare's, &s;end <HI>who</HI> you will, <HI>as many</HI> as you will; I will undertake, under &s;o gallant a leader, to rout an army of &s;cribblers, to cru&s;h a myriad of cockle-&s;hell critics, in his cau&s;e.</P>

<P>There cannot, I think, be a more flagrant in&s;tance of that perver&s;ity of apprehen&s;ion, which &s;eems to have di&s;tingui&s;hed almo&s;t all our poet's commentators, than the difficulty they have rai&s;ed about this pa&s;&s;age. It is true they have in general been much more &s;ucce&s;sful in throwing ob&s;tructions in the way of the reader, than in obviating tho&s;e which common &s;en&s;e and &s;imple ingenuity might naturally &s;ugge&s;t. For my part, I &s;hould never have dreamt that the&s;e ver&s;es &s;o greatly
<PB N="58" REF="73">
needed illu&s;tration, that they were corrupted, or that a line was lo&s;t and badly re&s;tored, unle&s;s the learned Dr. Warburton had told me of the fir&s;t, the ingenious and &s;en&s;ible authors of the Canons of Critici&s;m and of the Revi&s;al had in&s;inuated the &s;econd, and la&s;tly, the learned, ingenious and &s;en&s;ible Dr. John&s;on attempted to per&s;uade me of the third. In|deed, they have all &s;ucce&s;sfully laboured to throw &s;ome ob&s;cu|rity on the text, Mr. Edwards not excepted; for, though he hath facetiou&s;ly and ju&s;tly expo&s;ed Dr. Warburton's ridiculous emendation of the fifth line, he hath left the reader to explain the pa&s;&s;age him&s;elf, after a&s;&s;uring him that it certainly is faulty.</P>
<P>It will, I pre&s;ume, afford &s;ome entertainment to the reader to compare the &s;everal notes of the&s;e annotators; by which they will &s;ee how they have all blundered round-about the poet's meaning; perhaps for no other rea&s;on in the world than that they imagined it lay much deeper than it really does. It is not an uncommon thing for per&s;ons immoderately &s;aga|cious to look too far forward, and &s;tumble over what lies im|mediately under their no&s;e. Dr. John&s;on appears, indeed, to have a very different opinion of this matter; and &s;eems to think that Shake&s;peare's meaning is always very profound. Thus he tells us,
<Q>the original and predominant error of Dr. Warburton's Commentary, is acquie&s;cence in his fir&s;t thoughts; that precipitation which is produced by con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of quick di&s;cernment; and that confidence which pre&s;umes to do, by &s;urveying the &s;urface, what labour only can perform, by <HI>penetrating the bottom</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Dr. John&s;on's Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>For my part, I had always a very different opinion of Dr. Warburton's Commentary. That he did too precipitately ac|quie&s;ce in his own thoughts, may be very true; and that he &s;urveyed only the &s;urface of Shake&s;peare's writing may be no le&s;s &s;o; but that he went very deep into the rece&s;&s;es of his own imagination, as well as into his &s;tores of book-learning,
<PB N="59" REF="74">
for all tho&s;e far-fetched allu&s;ions, quaint epithets and literary conundrums, which he imputes to Shake&s;peare, is, I think, not to be doubted. For it is very true, as our editor al&s;o ob|&s;erves, that
<Q>his notes exhibit perver&s;e interpretations and improbable conjectures; he at one time gives the author more profundity of meaning than the &s;entence admits, and at another di&s;covers ab&s;urdities, where the &s;en&s;e is plain to every other reader <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Dr. John&s;on's Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is very natural to conclude, from this reprehen&s;ion, that Dr. John&s;on means to in&s;inuate his having him&s;elf repaired the faults of Dr. Warburton, and effected that by per&s;everance and labour, which the reverend &s;cholia&s;t, his predece&s;&s;or, failed to do by his vivacity and precipitation. It is certain, that <HI>labour</HI> nece&s;&s;arily takes up <HI>time</HI>; and &s;o far the frequent procra&s;tination of the pre&s;ent edition affords Dr. John&s;on a plau&s;ible excu&s;e for pretending to have laboured: but, on the other hand, it is as certain that <HI>time</HI> doth not nece&s;&s;arily in|clude <HI>labour</HI>; for, it is notorious that an indu&s;trious gerund-grinder may do as much or more in a month, than an <HI>idler</HI> will do in &s;even years. It is al&s;o farther certain that, although youth and inexperience may be too ha&s;ty and precipitate, yet experi|ence and age cannot well execute their work too expeditiou&s;ly; in the former ca&s;e delay may &s;erve to correct errors, and check the inordinance and exuberance of zeal; in the latter, it produces only languor and perplexity. Thus if Dr. John&s;on, in&s;tead of &s;piritedly repairing the neglect of tho&s;e who only <HI>&s;urveyed</HI> the <HI>&s;urface,</HI> had boldly and immediately <HI>penetrated</HI> to <HI>the bottom,</HI> all had po&s;&s;ibly been right: but, in&s;tead of doing this, it appears he hath been full as much too tardy as they were precipitate; and thus, leaving the weight of his learning, and the force of his reputation, to work their way without the lea&s;t application of genius, he hath &s;uffered them, by long and con&s;tant fric|tion, to perforate or to <HI>penetrate,</HI> as he &s;ays, <HI>the bottom</HI> it&s;elf. So that the &s;uperficial meanings, which former editors &s;kimmed from the top, are left hanging about the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el;
<PB N="60" REF="75">
while the profound di&s;coveries, weighty arguments, and &s;triking illu&s;trations, expected in the pre&s;ent edition, are all e&s;caped through the hole which Dr. John&s;on's mode&s;t indu&s;try and va&s;t erudition have worked through the bottom.</P>
<P>But, to leave this digre&s;&s;ion, and return to the notes of the &s;everal commentators. Dr. Warburton's, as it is in&s;erted by way of preference, no doubt, in the page before us, runs thus:</P>

<L>Becau&s;e thou art not &s;een,</L></Q> This &s;ong is de&s;igned to &s;uit the duke's exiled condition, who had been ruined by <HI>un|grateful flatterers.</HI> Now the <HI>winter wind,</HI> the &s;ong &s;ays, is to be preferred to <HI>man's ingratitude.</HI> But why? <HI>Becau&s;e it is not</HI> SEEN. But this was not only an aggravation of the injury, as it was done in &s;ecret, <HI>not &s;een,</HI> but was the very circum&s;tance that made the keenne&s;s of the ingratitude of his faithle&s;s courtiers. Without doubt Shake&s;peare wrote the line thus,
<Q><L>Becau&s;e thou art not <HI>SHEEN,</HI></L></Q>
i. e. &s;miling, and &s;hining, like an ungrateful court-&s;ervant, who flatters while he wounds, which was a very good rea|&s;on for giving the <HI>winter wind</HI> the preference. So in the Mid&s;ummer Night's Dream,
<Q><L>Spangled &s;tar light <HI>SHEEN;</HI></L></Q>
and &s;everal other places. Chaucer u&s;es it in this &s;en&s;e,
<Q><L>Your bli&s;sful &s;u&s;ter Lucina the <HI>SHENE.</HI></L></Q>
And Fairfax,
<Q><L>The &s;acred angel took his target <HI>SHENE,</HI></L>
<L>And by the Chri&s;tian champion &s;tood un&s;een.</L></Q>
The Oxford editor, who had this emendation communi|cated to him, takes occa&s;ion from thence to alter the whole line thus,
<Q><L>Thou cau&s;e&s;t not that teen.</L></Q>
But, in his rage of correction, he forgot to leave the rea&s;on, which is now wanting. Why the <HI>winter wind</HI> was to be preferred to <HI>man's ingratitude.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="61" REF="76">On this curious comment, the author of the Canons of Critici&s;m hath made the following remarks:</P>
<Q><P>This pa&s;&s;age [meaning the two lines quoted from the text] is certainly faulty; and perhaps it cannot be re&s;tored, as Shake&s;peare gave it. Sir Thomas Hanmer at la&s;t altered it into &s;en&s;e;
<Q>Thou cau&s;e&s;t not that teen.</Q>
But this, it &s;eems, will not do; becau&s;e, in <HI>his rage of cor|rection,</HI> he forgot to leave the rea&s;on, why the <HI>winter wind</HI> was to be preferred to man's ingratitude. So now Mr. Warburton comes with his emendation, which he charit|ably communicated to Sir Thomas, though he was &s;o gracele&s;s as not to make u&s;e of it.
<Q>Becau&s;e thou art not <HI>SHEEN.</HI></Q>
Though this matter is &s;o clear with Mr. Warburton, every body who under&s;tands Engli&s;h will doubt of it; be|cau&s;e SHEEN &s;ignifies bright, which makes no better &s;en&s;e than &s;een; nor does he produce any authority for its &s;igni|fying SMILING, which is the &s;en&s;e he here puts upon it; and to make it pa&s;s the better, he lugs in a parcel of <HI>"&s;miling, &s;hining, court &s;ervants, who flatter while they wound,</HI>" of whom there is not the lea&s;t hint in the &s;ong, or in the whole &s;cene.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Edwards then goes on to enumerate Dr. Warbur|ton's examples, which having quoted above, need not be repeated.&mdash;He proceeds&mdash;
<Q>The&s;e are the examples he produces; <HI>whether wi&s;ely or not, let the fore&s;t judge</HI>; but the conceit of a <HI>&s;miling target</HI> is entirely his own; and, if be will allow me a pun <HI>invita Minerva</HI>; for it &s;eems in direct oppo&s;ition to the famed Aegis of Pallas. But this is hardly a laughing matter: for with what face can he &s;ay <HI>&s;miling, &s;hining</HI>&mdash;&s;o Shake&s;peare.&mdash;Chaucer u&s;es it in this &s;en&s;e,&mdash;and Fairfax&mdash;when, if he knows any thing of the lan|guage, he mu&s;t know, that not one of them, in the&s;e in|&s;tances, u&s;es <HI>&s;heen</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of SMILING; and that, in
<PB N="62" REF="77">
its true &s;en&s;e of BRIGHT or &s;hining, it would make the pa&s;&s;age wor&s;e than he found it?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If Sir Thomas Hanmer, as he &s;ays, took occa&s;ion, from having this emendation communicated to him, to alter the whole line; he &s;hewed more judgment than if he had in&s;erted &s;uch a fal&s;e and non&s;en&s;ical note; but, "in his rage of correction, he forgot to leave the rea&s;on, why the winter wind was to be preferred to <HI>man's ingratitude.</HI>" If SHEEN does not &s;ignify <HI>&s;miling,</HI> I doubt Mr. Warburton will be in the &s;ame ca&s;e. However Shake&s;peare has equally forgotten, in the next &s;tanza, to leave the rea&s;on why a freezing &s;ky is to be preferred to a <HI>forgetful friend</HI>; which, perhaps, may give a rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picion that the word <HI>be|cau&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ingenious writer does not intimate what he thinks might be the right word; but if he be right in his &s;u&s;picion, I conceive that, in&s;tead of the conjunction copulative <HI>becau&s;e,</HI> Shake&s;peare mu&s;t u&s;e the adverb or prepo&s;ition disjunctive <HI>be&s;ide.</HI></NOTE>, in the fir&s;t &s;tanza, may be corrupt.</Q></P>
<P>The author of the REVISAL of <HI>Shake&s;peare's Text,</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>What the meaning of the common reading,
<Q>Becau&s;e thou art not SEEN,</Q>
may be, it is extremely difficult to di&s;cover, which gives great ground for &s;u&s;picion that it may be corrupt. Po&s;&s;ibly it might be intended to be this: the impre&s;&s;ions thou make&s;t on us are not &s;o cutting, becau&s;e thou art an un&s;een agent, with whom we have not the lea&s;t acquaintance or conver&s;e, and therefore have the le&s;s rea&s;on to repine at thy treat|ment of us.</Q></P>
<P>To come now to Dr. John&s;on; who, after quoting Dr. Warburton's note, without mentioning a &s;yllable of Mr. Ed|wards's remarks on it, proceeds thus:
<Q>I am afraid that no reader is &s;atisfied with Dr. Warburton's emendation, how|ever vigorou&s;ly enforced; and it is indeed enforced with more art than truth. <HI>Sheen,</HI> i. e. <HI>&s;miling, &s;hining.</HI> That <HI>&s;heen</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>&s;hining,</HI> is ea&s;ily proved; but when or where
<PB N="63" REF="78">
did it &s;ignify <HI>&s;miling?</HI> Yet <HI>&s;miling</HI> gives the &s;en&s;e nece&s;&s;ary in this place. Sir Thomas Hanmer's change is le&s;s uncouth, but too remote from the pre&s;ent text. For my part, I que&s;tion whether the original is not lo&s;t, and this &s;ub&s;tituted merely to fill up the mea&s;ures and the rhyme. Yet even out of this line, by &s;trong agitation, may &s;en&s;e be elicited, and &s;en&s;e not un&s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. <HI>Thou winter wind,</HI> &s;ays the duke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No, Dr. John&s;on, it is his cou&s;in Amiens <HI>&s;ings</HI> it.</NOTE>, <HI>thy rudene&s;s gives the le&s;s pain, as thou art not &s;een, as thou art an enemy that do&s;t not brave us with thy pre&s;ence, and who&s;e unkindne&s;s is therefore not aggravated by in&s;ult.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After &s;o many avowed a&s;&s;urances of the difficulty of the above pa&s;&s;age, and the un&s;ucce&s;sful, though elaborate, at|tempts to clear it up; it may &s;eem affectation in me to in&s;i&s;t on its being very obvious. I mu&s;t declare, however, that before I had read any of the above critici&s;ms, it always &s;eemed &s;o, though I mu&s;t own I did not take either the particular meaning of the words, or the general de&s;ign of the &s;ong, in the &s;ame manner as is done by any of the above-mentioned critics. Dr. Warburton &s;eems, indeed, to have mi&s;led them all, by confounding ingratitude with pretended friend&s;hip or private enmity. That flatterers are often &s;ecret enemies, and generally ungrateful, is very true; but it is by no means e&s;|&s;ential to acts of ingratitude that they &s;hould be committed in &s;ecret; and, on the contrary, though it be di&s;ingenuous, mean, and cowardly to do private injuries, it may not be ungrateful; for the doer may happen not be obliged to the per&s;on offended. With regard al&s;o to the particular ca&s;e be|fore us, there is no doubt but the bani&s;hed duke had &s;uffered enough from public and <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> acts of ingratitude: the wick|edne&s;s of which would therefore be aggravated, as Dr. John|&s;on rightly &s;ays, by in&s;ult; and would not be, like acts of fal&s;e friend&s;hip or private enmity, aggravated by being done
<PB N="64" REF="79">
in &s;ecret. When Dr. John&s;on, therefore, adopting Dr. War|burton's rea&s;oning, tells us that <HI>&s;miling</HI> gives the &s;en&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary in this place, he is mi&s;led by the plau&s;ibility of that gen|tleman's argument; there being no manner of occa&s;ion, as Mr. Edwards ob&s;erves, for the introduction of his flattering courtiers.</P>
<P>Having expatiated &s;o much on the difficulty and mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;age, I come now to explain it that way in which I have ever under&s;tood it; and according to which, I think, there is no manner of difficulty in reconciling the &s;en&s;e to the words as they now &s;tand. Nay, I flatter my&s;elf many readers will di&s;cover more beauty in this admirable lit|tle &s;ong, than they were before acquainted with. Before I enter, however, on the explanation of particular words, I &s;hall con&s;ider the de&s;ign and tendency of the &s;ong in general. To this end it may be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the whole.
<Q><LG>
<L>Blow, blow, thou winter wind,</L>
<L>Thou art not &s;o unkind</L>
<L>As man's ingratitude;</L>
<L>Thy tooth is not &s;o keen,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e thou art not &s;een,</L>
<L>Although thy breath be rude.</L>
<L>Heigh ho! &s;ing heigh ho! &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter &s;ky,</L>
<L>That do&s;t not bite &s;o nigh</L>
<L>As benefits forgot:</L>
<L>Though thou the waters warp,</L>
<L>Thy &s;ting is not &s;o &s;harp</L>

<L>Heigh ho! &s;ing heigh ho! &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q>
The reader will ob&s;erve that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ver&s;e is addre&s;&s;ed to the WIND, and the <HI>&s;econd</HI> to the SKY; by which latter is evi|dently <HI>meant</HI> the air or atmo&s;phere, as appears by the attri|tributes or qualities he imputes to it. It is ob&s;ervable, far|ther,
<PB N="65" REF="80">
that the poet has, with great judgment, kept the pro|perties and effects of both di&s;tinct, beginning with the lea&s;t hurtful, and proceeding regularly in the climax to the mo&s;t cutting and &s;evere.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, I come now to the di&s;puted meaning of the particular words: and here all the &s;cholia&s;ts &s;eem to blunder, in mi&s;taking the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>keen</HI> in the fourth line; which they take to &s;ignify <HI>&s;harp, cutting, piercing</HI>; whereas it only means <HI>eager, vehement</HI>; a &s;en&s;e equally com|mon with the former. The poet &s;peaks here only of a keen|ne&s;s of appetite; he does not mention actual biting, till he comes to addre&s;s a more proper and powerful agent: for, tho' it be the property of the wind to blu&s;ter and make a noi&s;e, it doth not bite, unle&s;s it bring with it a nipping fro&s;ty air. It does not freeze more in an high wind, than when its breath is neither felt nor heard; but often le&s;s. Be&s;ides, if <HI>keen</HI> here means <HI>&s;harp, piercing,</HI> &amp;c. this line hath the &s;ame meaning as the &s;eventh line of the &s;econd ver&s;e, where the poet is at the la&s;t &s;tage of his climax. And I think he would hardly be guilty of &s;uch a piece of tautology, in the &s;pace of &s;o few lines, or ad|dre&s;s the le&s;s &s;evere and powerful agent exactly in the &s;ame manner as he does that which is more &s;o.</P>
<P>Taking the word in this &s;en&s;e, let us &s;ee its effect on the context.</P>
<Q>Thy tooth is not &s;o keen.</Q>
<P>That is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>thou art not &s;o eager to</HI> bite; <HI>thy appetite is not &s;o voracious&mdash;thou art not &s;o violent to di&s;tre&s;s us.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Becau&s;e thou art not &s;een,</L>
<L>Although thy breath be rude.</L></Q>
<P>In other words, <HI>becau&s;e thou do&s;t not come in a vi&s;ible form to confront us, notwith&s;tanding thou in&s;ulte&s;t us with thy abu&s;ive blu&s;tering.&mdash;Thou do&s;t not &s;hew thy grim</HI> LOOKS, <HI>though we hear thy roaring</HI> VOICE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;peare u&s;es <HI>breath</HI> for <HI>voice</HI> al&s;o in the Twelfth-Night; SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK.

It were indeed extremely offen&s;ive to &s;ee others <HI>&s;hew their teeth</HI> at us, even though they could not bite. Perhaps Shake&s;peare had &s;ome di&s;tant allu&s;ion to this prover|bial phra&s;e: it is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that the invi&s;ibility of the wind was a circum&s;tance which this great poet had frequently in his mind. Thus, in Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure, he &s;peaks of the <HI>viewle&s;s</HI> winds; an epithet, I believe, peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I now tru&s;t this explanation to the reader's judgment, and &s;hould al&s;o take leave of the &s;ubject it&s;elf, were there not an expre&s;&s;ion in the la&s;t &s;tanza; the beauty of which is, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t, for want of being rightly under&s;tood.&mdash;I have not undertaken, indeed, to &s;upply the defects of the commentators; but as this &s;ong is a favourite, I cannot pro|ceed without making a &s;light animadver&s;ion or two on this head. The expre&s;&s;ion I mean is,
<Q>Though thou the waters WARP.</Q>
The word <HI>warp</HI> has been very differently u&s;ed by different writers: it is u&s;ed by &s;ome to mean <HI>contract</HI> or <HI>&s;hrivel,</HI> to <HI>turn a&s;ide,</HI> &amp;c. and a certain lexicographer, in his folio dic|tionary, quotes this very line to &s;hew that it is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the effects of fro&s;t. But may we not pertinently a&s;k him, what the&s;e effects are? Does he mean to &s;ay, that Shake&s;peare hath u&s;ed it here in a &s;en&s;e different from its mo&s;t general and obvious meaning? If he does, he does not under&s;tand the poet; if he does not, he knows not how to write a dictionary. To <HI>warp,</HI> here means neither to <HI>contract,</HI> nor to <HI>turn a&s;ide</HI>; for the body of water in freezing is dilated, not contracted; and though the fro&s;t may arre&s;t or &s;top water in its pa&s;&s;age, I don't know that it alters its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The word <HI>waters,</HI> indeed, doth not mean here, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, water in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tract, as a fluid in general; it means al&s;o neither the waving, <HI>multitudinous,</HI> &s;ea, nor the ra|pid

unfreezing rivers, but &s;uch inland pools, lakes, and other &s;tagnant or &s;lowly-moving pieces of water that are &s;ubject to be affected by fro&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Agreeable to this, when the rivers break down or run over their banks, laying the country under water, we &s;ay the <HI>waters</HI> are out. When the river is returned again to its channel al&s;o, the pools remaining behind in the adjacent fields or meadows, are called the <HI>waters.</HI></P></NOTE>. Now, it is well known that the &s;urface of &s;uch <HI>waters,</HI> as is here meant, &s;o long as they remain fluid, i. e. unfrozen, is apparently a perfect plane; whereas when they are frozen, this &s;urface deviates from its exact flatne&s;s, or <HI>warps.</HI> This is peculiarly remarkable in &s;mall ponds, the &s;urface of which, when frozen, forms a regular concave; the ice on the &s;ides ri&s;ing higher than that in the middle. Thus we &s;ee that Shake&s;peare need not to be obliged to any lexicographer for admitting the latitude of his expre&s;|&s;ion, as he here u&s;es the word <HI>warp</HI> in its primitive and mo&s;t general &s;ignification; to make a thing <HI>ca&s;t</HI> or <HI>bend,</HI> as boards do when they are cut before they are thoroughly dry, or when they are put to the fire.</P>

<P>I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock|pigeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot again&s;t rain; more new-fangled than an ape; more giddy in my de&s;ires than a monkey; I will weep for no|thing, like <HI>Diana</HI> in the fountain; and I will do that, when you are di&s;po&s;ed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when you are inclined to <HI>&s;leep.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. Warburton &s;ays,
<Q>that in&s;tead of the la&s;t word <HI>&s;leep,</HI> we &s;hould read <HI>weep:</HI></Q>
to this reading, however, Dr. John|&s;on objects.
<Q>I know not, &s;ays he, why we &s;hould read <HI>to weep.</HI> I believe mu&s;t men would be more angry to have their <HI>&s;leep</HI> hindered than their grief interrupted.</Q></P>
<P>What our editor &s;ugge&s;ts is certainly very true, e&s;pecially of per&s;ons addicted to &s;omnolency; but if the poet intended the antithe&s;is Dr. Warburton &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hould rather read <HI>weep:</HI> but then the con&s;truction of the &s;entence will not do. In&s;tead of &s;aying, <HI>I will laugh like a hyen, and that when you are inclined to weep</HI>; the <HI>and</HI> &s;hould be tran&s;po&s;ed, and the word <HI>that</HI> omitted. He &s;hould have &s;aid, AND <HI>I will</HI> LAUGH <HI>like a hyen, when you are inclined to</HI> WEEP. Suppo&s;ing the text uncorrupted in no other particular, I mu&s;t give my voice, with the editor, for <HI>&s;leep.</HI> But I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting that this pa&s;&s;age is corrupted in a part where none of the commenta|tors &s;eem to think it. It is ju&s;tly to be pre&s;umed, at lea&s;t, that Dr. John&s;on does not think it &s;o, as he pa&s;&s;es it over, notwith&s;tanding he a&s;&s;ures us, in his preface, that he hath left not one pa&s;&s;age, that he thought ob&s;cure, without attempt|ing to elucidate it.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay to Ro&s;alind's <HI>laughing like a</HI> HYEN? If by a <HI>hyen</HI> is meant an <HI>hyaena,</HI> I do not know what authority we have for its <HI>laughing,</HI> nor can di&s;cover the propriety of the allu&s;ion. It is reported, indeed, of that furious animal,
<PB N="69" REF="84">
that it will counterfeit a man's voice; nay, call him by his name, to entice him out of doors, in order to devour him; after which he may be &s;aid, metaphorically, to <HI>laugh in his &s;leeve</HI> at the &s;ucce&s;s of his contrivance. But the laughing here alluded to, mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily &s;o loud as to prevent a drow&s;y man's going to &s;leep; and I do not know that any animal in nature is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;treperous part of ri&s;ibility, except <HI>man.</HI>
<Q><HI>Homo</HI> e&s;t animal <HI>ri&s;ibile,</HI></Q>
and I believe exclu&s;ively &s;o. Shake&s;peare then can never mean to &s;ay, <HI>like an hyaena.</HI></P>
<P>"What then could he mean?"&mdash;True, reader, that is the que&s;tion.&mdash;Have but a little patience and I will endeavour to tell you.&mdash;Shake&s;peare, with all his diver&s;ity of action and character, is generally very uniform and con&s;tant in his train of thinking. He does not chop his metaphors into fritters; nor &s;kip giddily and alternately from the allu&s;ions of art to tho&s;e of nature, or vic&ecirc; ver&s;&acirc;. The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that, in the preceding line, and in this very &s;en|tence, he mentions <HI>Diana.</HI> Now, it is not at all like Shake&s;|peare to fly off immediately from this cla&s;&s;ical allu&s;ion, to &s;o di&s;tant a one as any afforded by natural hi&s;tory; even &s;uppo|&s;ing there were not that impropriety in it as I have above noticed.</P>
<P>I would venture, after the modi&s;h way of deciding argu|ments, to lay a good bet, if it could be determined, that Shake&s;peare wrote thus;</P>

<Q>EPILOGUE. If it be true, that <HI>good wine needs no bu&s;h,</HI> 'tis true, that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do u&s;e good bu&s;hes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a ca&s;e am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor can in|&s;inuate with you in the behalf of a good play?</Q>
<P><Q>Here, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, &s;eems to be a cha&s;m or &s;ome other depravation, which de&s;troys the &s;entiment <HI>here</HI> intended.

&mdash;Happy is it for the memory of Shake&s;peare, and as happy for his di&s;cerning readers, that the veneration paid to his name &s;ometimes pre|vents the hand of the commentator from executing tho&s;e de&s;igns which his temerity conceives. What work would not a critic, of le&s;s mode&s;ty than our editor, make of this pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould he take it in his head to &s;upply what is thus &s;uppo&s;ed wanting? Yet how ea&s;ily is the whole &s;et right! It can hardly be called a <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition</HI> that Shake&s;peare wrote <HI>tho</HI>' in&s;tead of <HI>then</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a tran&s;criber might make &s;uch a mi&s;take, is al&s;o as likely, as that he &s;hould write <HI>tho</HI>' for <HI>then,</HI> as, Dr. John&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, is done in King John, page 410.</NOTE>. It is obvious he mu&s;t, as he plays on the word <HI>good</HI> all through the pa&s;&s;age, not once introducing the epithet <HI>bad,</HI> made u&s;e of by Dr. John&s;on, nor hinting at the antithe&s;is, which the editor conceives &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;en&s;e. <HI>Tho</HI>', at the end of a &s;entence, is commonly u&s;ed in di&s;cour&s;e for <HI>however,</HI> and

Be this, however, as it may, what is &s;ub|&s;tituted by Dr. John&s;on is entirely foreign to the purpo&s;e.

Good wine will recommend it&s;elf, and &s;ell without a bu&s;h; but we do not thence infer, that the goodne&s;s of any bu&s;h can recommend or &s;ell bad wine.&mdash;The Bermudans, I am told, when they go fi&s;hing, never trouble them&s;elves to carry any oil or butter for &s;auce; for if they catch a fat fi&s;h it <HI>requires</HI> none, and if they catch a lean one it <HI>de&s;erves</HI> none.&mdash;Shake&s;peare, I fancy, by &s;aying nothing about either bad wine or bad plays, rea&s;oned about them both as the Bermudans do about their fi&s;h.</P>

<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>How well he's read to rea&s;on again&s;t reading!</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton and Dr. John&s;on, having both exerted their critical abilities on this pa&s;&s;age, and, as I think, left it wor&s;e than they found it, I &s;hall in&s;ert the annotations of both, as I find them printed in the pages before me.</P>
<Q><PB N="73" REF="88"><P><Q><L>Too much to know is to know nought but <HI>FAME;</HI></L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q> The fir&s;t line in this reading is ab&s;urd and impertinent. There are two ways of &s;etting it right. The fir&s;t is to read thus,
<Q>Too much to know is to know nought but <HI>SHAME.</HI></Q>
This makes a fine &s;en&s;e, and alludes to Adam's fall, which came from the inordinate pa&s;&s;ion of knowing too much. The other way is to read, and point it thus,
<Q>Too much to know, is to know nought: but <HI>FEIGN, i. e.</HI> to feign.</Q>
As much as to &s;ay, the affecting to know too much is the way to know nothing. The &s;en&s;e in both the&s;e readings is equally good: but with this difference; if we read the fir&s;t way, the following line is impertinent, and, to &s;ave the correction, we mu&s;t judge it &s;purious. If we read it the &s;econd way, then the following line compleats the &s;en&s;e. Con&s;equently the correction of <HI>feign</HI> is to be preferred. <HI>To know too much</HI> (&s;ays the &s;peaker) <HI>is to know nothing; it is only</HI> FEIGNING <HI>to know what we do not; giving</HI> NAMES <HI>for things without knowing their</HI> NATURES; <HI>which is</HI> FALSE <HI>knowledge</HI>: and this was the peculiar defect of the peripa|tetic philo&s;ophy then in vogue. The&s;e philo&s;ophers, the poet, with the highe&s;t humour and good &s;en&s;e, calls <HI>the god-fathers of nature,</HI> who could only give things a <HI>name,</HI> but had no manner of acquaintance with their e&s;&s;ences.</P></Q>
<P>On the above annotation, Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves,
<Q>that there being <HI>two ways of &s;etting a pa&s;&s;age right,</HI> gives rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that there may be a third way better than either. The fir&s;t of the&s;e emendations <HI>makes a fine &s;en&s;e,</HI> but will not unite with the next line; the other makes a &s;en&s;e le&s;s fine, and yet will not rhyme to the corre&s;pondent word. I cannot &s;ee why the pa&s;&s;age may not &s;tand without di&s;tur|bance. <HI>The con&s;equence,</HI> &s;ays Biron, <HI>of too much knowledge,</HI> is not any real &s;olution of doubts, but mere empty <HI>repu|tation</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In our editor's appendix, &s;peaking of this pa&s;&s;age, he points, reads, and explains thus;
<Q><L>Too much to know is to know nought, but fame;</L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q>
<Q>That is, too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every god-father can give likewi&s;e.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="89">The author of the Revi&s;al hath a very long note on this pa&s;&s;age; rejecting the emendations propo&s;ed by Dr. Warbur|ton, and &s;eeming to coincide with the opinion of Dr. John&s;on. His explanation of the pa&s;&s;age is this.
<Q>Too eager a pur&s;uit of knowledge is rewarded, not with the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its object, but only with the reputation of having attain|ed it.</Q></P>
<P>It is really &s;urprizing to me, that the&s;e &s;everal critics &s;hould be &s;o much at a lo&s;s to comprehend, what I conceive the con|text renders very plain; without making any alteration in the text, as it &s;tood before Dr. Warburton meddled with it, viz.
<Q><L>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame;</L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q>
I cannot imagine what put it into the head of Dr. John&s;on, or of the author of the Revi&s;al, that <HI>fame</HI> here means <HI>repu|tation.</HI> And, &s;uppo&s;ing it does, what can Dr. John&s;on mean by &s;aying, that <HI>too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every god-father can give likewi&s;e?</HI> What, becau&s;e every god-father can call a child N or M, is he able therefore to give him a literary reputation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This puts me in mind of a certain French book&s;eller; who, &s;peaking of the profe&s;&s;ion to which he intended to bring up an igno|rant booby of a &s;on; <HI>By-gar,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Mon&s;ieur, I will make him one author; he &s;hall be the fir&s;t writer of the age. Morbleu, he &s;hall be une philo&s;ophe; une Voltaire!</HI></P></NOTE>? or is Dr. John&s;on &s;o carele&s;s of his pointing, as to mean to &s;ay that reputation is a mere name? Or, farther, how can <HI>to know nought but fame</HI> mean to <HI>acquire</HI> nothing but <HI>reputation?</HI> Be all this, however, as it may, <HI>fame</HI> means here nothing more than <HI>report, rumour</HI> or
<PB N="75" REF="90">
<HI>relation.</HI> Biron is declaiming again&s;t <HI>reading,</HI> or the mere &s;tudy of books. Little, &s;ays he,
<Q><L>&mdash;have continual plodders ever won,</L>
<L>Save ba&s;e authority from others' books:</L></Q>
the authors of which books he calls
<Q><L>&mdash;earthly god-fathers of heaven's lights,</L>
<L>That give a name to every fixed &s;tar.</L></Q>
Now, continues he,
<Q><L>Too much to know, is to know nought but <HI>fame</HI>;</L>
<L>And every god-father can give a name.</L></Q>
To all which the king replies, by ob&s;erving to another noble|man, how well Biron is <HI>read,</HI>
<Q>&mdash;to rea&s;on again&s;t READING.</Q>
Hence, I think it is plain that Biron means, through the whole pa&s;&s;age, to inculcate a maxim, which is undoubtedly a very true one, viz. that the greate&s;t readers are not the mo&s;t &s;cientific; the knowledge of things and of words being as different, as the &s;tudy of nature and the plodding over books. From the latter, people may acquire a heap of indige&s;ted lite|rature, without having any real knowledge at all: indeed, their too great attention to philological pur&s;uits, or to words, often prevents their knowing any thing of philo&s;ophy or of things. Add to this, that the knowledge acquired from books, is, for the mo&s;t part, founded on the authority of the writer, and what is thus known, is known only by <HI>report</HI> or <HI>relation.</HI> So that tho&s;e, who&s;e whole &s;tock of knowledge con&s;i&s;ts in what they have read, merely in the learned lumber of their memory, may, with great propriety, be &s;aid to know nothing but what is told them; that is, to be entirely ignorant of <HI>facts,</HI> and <HI>to know nothing but</HI> FAME It would be ab&s;urd al&s;o, to the la&s;t degree, to &s;ay, that <HI>to know</HI> TOO MUCH <HI>would be to know</HI> NOTHING, if no difference in the kind of knowledge was intended. Again, the la&s;t line of Biron's &s;peech evidently refers to what he had ju&s;t before &s;aid, concerning the <HI>ba&s;e
<PB N="76" REF="91">
authority</HI> of books. The authors can give <HI>names,</HI> &s;ays he, to things; in&s;tancing tho&s;e,
<Q>That give a name to every fixed &s;tar,</Q>
though they profit no more by them, and know nothing far|ther about them, than tho&s;e who are ignorant of tho&s;e names. And this being all they can do, he may well call their wri|tings <HI>ba&s;e authority,</HI> and &s;ay that any body can do as much, for
<Q>&mdash;Every god-father can give a <HI>name,</HI></Q>
which is as much at lea&s;t as a&s;tronomers do by the &s;tars.</P>
<P>The author of the Revi&s;al &s;eems to think the word <HI>fame,</HI> in this place, hath &s;ome reference to the king's &s;peech at the commencement of the play; when he propo&s;es <HI>reputation</HI> as the principal aim and motive of their &s;tudies.
<Q><L>Let <HI>Fame,</HI> that all hunt after in their lives,</L>
<L>Live regi&s;ter'd upon our brazen tombs;</L>
<L>And then grace us in the di&s;grace of death:</L>
<L>When, &s;pight of cormorant devouring time,</L>
<L>Th' endeavour of this pre&s;ent breath may buy</L>
<L>That honour which &s;hall 'bate his &s;cythe's keen edge;</L>
<L>And make us heirs of all eternity.</L></Q>
But admitting this, I cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on to think that <HI>fame,</HI> in the pa&s;&s;age di&s;puted, hath preci&s;ely the &s;ame meaning as in that ju&s;t quoted, unle&s;s both &s;peeches had been &s;poken by the king.&mdash;It is not unlikely that this pa&s;&s;age refers to the <HI>fame</HI> recommended by the king; but it is very unlikely that the &s;peaker &s;hould affect to &s;et a greater value on <HI>knowledge</HI> than on that <HI>fame,</HI> which was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed as the ultimate end to be attained by it.&mdash;It is, in my opinion, more than probable that Biron the &s;peaker, who is evidently a wit, and rails at book-learning, takes the advantage here of the equi|vocal u&s;e of the word <HI>fame</HI>; to &s;neer at the king's propo&s;ing celebrity as the end of his &s;tudies: in which ca&s;e the conte&s;ted line might be paraphra&s;ed thus; <HI>To &s;pend all your time in getting to know only the</HI> names <HI>of things, and what others report about
<PB N="77" REF="92">
them, is the way to get</HI> nothing <HI>el&s;e but</HI> fame <HI>&s;ure enough!</HI> Indeed, Biron &s;eems to be a man of &s;uch a kidney, as to rea&s;on about <HI>literary fame</HI> as Fal&s;taff does about <HI>military ho|nour,</HI> and could ea&s;ily re&s;olve it in like manner by a trim reckoning, into a very word, air, a mere empty <HI>report.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. John&s;on tells us in his preface, that, when he in&s;erts any of Dr. Warburton's propo&s;ed emendations in the text, he means to give them his highe&s;t approbation. Now, this he hath done in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; giving that &s;cholia&s;t's note likewi&s;e at the bottom of the page. The note is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;<HI>Taken</HI> WITH <HI>the manner.</HI>] The following que&s;tion ari&s;ing from the&s;e words, &s;hews we &s;hould read&mdash;<HI>taken</HI> IN <HI>the manner.</HI> And this was the phra&s;e in u&s;e to &s;ignify <HI>taken in the fact.</HI> So Dr. Donne, in his letters, <HI>But if I melt into melancholy while I write, I &s;hall be taken</HI> IN <HI>the manner; and I &s;it by one too tender to the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The author of the Canons of Critici&s;m, however, hath in|validated what Dr. Warburton advances in this place, by an|other of his own notes on a pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t part of Henry the Fourth, where the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion occurs; and on which the &s;ame reverend commentator &s;ays:
<Q>The quarto and folio read <HI>with the manner,</HI> which is right. <HI>Taken with the manner</HI> is a law phra&s;e, and then in u&s;e to &s;ignify <HI>taken in the fact.</HI></Q>
&mdash;Mr. Edwards ob&s;erved, on remarking this in|con&s;i&s;tency, that "Great wits have &s;hort memories." But I am at &s;ome lo&s;s to know to what I &s;hould impute Dr. John|&s;on's <HI>giving the highe&s;t approbation</HI> to this blunder of Dr. War|burton's. That his memory is at lea&s;t as bad, and his atten|tion full as little, is evident from his quoting both the&s;e con|tradictory
<PB N="78" REF="93">
notes in their re&s;pective places, and his giving the highe&s;t approbation to both the contradictory emendations, by in&s;erting them in the text; one in the play before us, and the other in that of Henry IV. Notwith&s;tanding the incon&s;i&s;tency had been pointed out in a book, that hath run through at lea&s;t &s;ix editions. To what can we impute &s;uch &s;ervile tran&s;cription? Shall we &s;et it down among Dr. John|&s;on's other conce&s;&s;ions to the <HI>re&s;pect due to high place, and his veneration for genius and learning?</HI> Or &s;hall we rather impute it to his indolence in not con&s;ulting the Canons of Criti|ci&s;m?&mdash;Or perhaps he would neither chu&s;e to depend on the authority of that writer, nor even on Dr. Warburton's him&s;elf, again&s;t the united &s;uffrage of Dr. Warburton and Dr. Donne. He might have depended, however, on the farther authority of Shake&s;peare; which he might have had by turning over a few pages more of the volume before us; the Clown in the Winter's Tale u&s;ing the &s;ame phra&s;e, thus, <HI>Your wor&s;hip had like to have given us one, if you had not taken your&s;elf</HI> WITH <HI>the manner.</HI></P>
<P>My readers will hardly doubt, on this repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e, that the common phra&s;e was <HI>taken</HI> WITH <HI>the manner.</HI> As to the certainty of its being adopted here, however, it may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;till di&s;puted. Dr. Warburton &s;ays, Biron's que&s;tion, immediately &s;ucceeding, &s;hews that Co&s;tard &s;hould &s;ay IN <HI>the manner.</HI> For my part I cannot &s;ee the force of this rea&s;on, though I can very well &s;ee why Biron &s;hould not re|peat WITH <HI>the manner,</HI> becau&s;e of another law phra&s;e, with which Co&s;tard an&s;wers him, viz. IN <HI>manner and form follow|ing.</HI> Now this could not be, with any propriety, WITH <HI>man|ner and form following.</HI> But I think there is no impropriety in &s;uppo&s;ing that Biron, not attending to the quaintne&s;s of Co&s;tard's expre&s;&s;ion, a&s;ks him &s;imply and naturally IN <HI>what manner</HI>? notwith&s;tanding Co&s;tard had u&s;ed the phra&s;e WITH <HI>what manner.</HI> Be all this, however, as it may, we have here a very flagrant in&s;tance, IN <HI>what manner</HI> Dr. John&s;on

I dare &s;ay not one <HI>reader</HI> of Shake&s;peare in a hundred, and perhaps not all his <HI>commentators,</HI> know very well what to make of it. Ar|mado, indeed, is very explicit on the &s;ubject. <Q>It is, &s;ays he,
<Q><L>&mdash;an epilogue or di&s;cour&s;e, to make plain</L>
<L>Some ob&s;cure precedence that hath to fore been &s;ain.</L></Q>

<L>There's the moral now the <HI>l'envoy.</HI></L></Q></P></Q></P>
<P>All this is plain and intelligible enough; every Engli&s;h reader al&s;o might learn from Boyer, that <HI>envoy</HI> meant the conclu&s;ion of a ballad or &s;onnet; from which he might be led to mi&s;take

<STAGE>Looking at her gla&s;s, and giving the Fore&s;ter money.</STAGE></Q>
<P><Q>To under&s;tand, &s;ays our editor, how the prince&s;s has her gla&s;s &s;o ready at hand in a ca&s;ual conver&s;ation, it mu&s;t be remembered, that in tho&s;e days it was the fa&s;hion among the French ladies to wear a looking-gla&s;s, <HI>as Mr.</HI> BAYLE <HI>coar&s;ely repre&s;ents it,</HI> ON THEIR BELLIES; that is, to have a &s;mall mirrour, &s;et in gold, hanging at the girdle, by which they occa&s;ionally viewed their faces, or adju&s;ted their hair.</Q>
&mdash;As Mr. John&s;on is almo&s;t always above referring particularly to his authorities, I cannot readily turn to the pa&s;&s;age in Bayle where he makes this <HI>coar&s;e repre&s;entation.</HI> I am greatly apt to &s;u&s;pect, however, from the opinion I have of Mon&s;. Bayle's u&s;ual propriety and elegance, that our editor hath mi&s;taken his meaning. It appears to me that, if the&s;e mirrors were hanging at the girdle, they would have been rather repre|&s;ented as worn at the <HI>&s;ide,</HI> than <HI>on the belly,</HI> as the watch and <HI>etui</HI> are at pre&s;ent. Add to this, that if the ribbon or chain, by which they were hung, was &s;o long as to permit the wearer to adju&s;t her hair, without taking it quite off (as is rea&s;onable to
<PB N="81" REF="96">
&s;uppo&s;e) it could hardly be &s;u&s;pended at the girdle; for in that ca&s;e &s;uch gla&s;&s;es would hang down to the knee, and could not, with any propriety, be &s;aid to be worn on the belly. I imagine, therefore, the&s;e mirrors were &s;u&s;pended from the neck, or &s;omehow fa&s;tened to the drapery covering the &s;to|mach and brea&s;t; in which ca&s;e, Mr. Bayle might &s;ay, with|out the lea&s;t inelegance, they were worn <HI>&s;ur le ventre.</HI> For I will venture to &s;ay it is, from his u&s;ing the word <HI>ventre</HI> on this occa&s;ion, that Dr. John&s;on charges him with <HI>coar&s;ene&s;s</HI>; but <HI>ventre</HI> doth not always &s;ignify the <HI>belly.</HI></P>
<P>The French di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;tomach and belly, by calling the former the <HI>petit-ventre,</HI> or VENTRE SUPERIEUR; and the latter the <HI>bas-ventre.</HI> The general term is al&s;o fre|quently u&s;ed in&s;tead of POITRINE, and as often means the <HI>&s;tomach</HI> and <HI>brea&s;t,</HI> as it doth the <HI>belly.</HI>&mdash;Vaugelas will tell him al&s;o, that the word <HI>ventre</HI> is u&s;ed with great elegance in metaphorical writing. Thus, <HI>pa&s;&s;er &s;ur le ventre &agrave; &s;on en|nemi,</HI> is an approved phra&s;e for <HI>giving an enemy a total defeat.</HI> The French, in like manner, u&s;e the word <HI>entrailles,</HI> in &s;uch phra&s;es as, literally tran&s;lated, would be very <HI>coar&s;e</HI> and di&s;|gu&s;ting to an Engli&s;h ear. To in&s;tance only one or two. <HI>Seigneur, votre loi e&s;t grav&eacute;ee dans le fond de mes entrailles.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Les entrailles de la mi&s;ericorde de Dieu.</HI> One of the mo&s;t ele|gant French writers, now living, al&s;o calls the natural affec|tion of a parent for his child, <HI>l'amour des entrailles.</HI> But what &s;hould we think of an Engli&s;h critic, who &s;hould tran&s;late &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages thus: <HI>Thy law, O Lord, is engraven in our guts&mdash;The entrails of the mercy of God&mdash;The affection of the bowels</HI>&mdash;and thence take occa&s;ion to cen&s;ure the writer for <HI>coar&s;e|ne&s;s</HI> and inelegance?</P>
<P>We are informed, by &s;ome letters lately publi&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the St. James's Chronicle, and other news-papers; as al&s;o the monthly magazines.</NOTE>, that when Dr. John&s;on came to town, about the year 1730, he had a de&s;ign of engaging in &s;ome tran&s;lation from the French.
<PB N="82" REF="97">
Whether he ever did or no, I cannot &s;ay; but, from this and &s;ome other &s;pecimens of his acquaintance with that lan|guage, I cannot help thinking the author would have been extremely unlucky that had fallen into his hands.</P>

<P><Q><HI>The night of dew, that on my cheeks down flows.</HI>] I cannot think the <HI>night of dew</HI> the true reading, but know not what to offer.</Q></P>
<P>That is very &s;trange! Dr. John&s;on.&mdash;Why, thou mu&s;t have no more invention in thee than there is in a leaden plummet: thy pega&s;us mu&s;t be confined and hoodwinked like a hor&s;e in a mill; or &s;urely &s;omething would have &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf to a writer who declares, that
<Q>not a &s;ingle pa&s;|&s;age, in this whole work, has appeared to him corrupt, which he has not attempted to re&s;tore!</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. John&s;on's Preface.</NOTE>&mdash;I would be far from &s;eeking to depreciate the &s;ucce&s;s of our editor's <HI>mode&s;t indu&s;try</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. John&s;on's Preface.</NOTE>: but I am afraid the purcha&s;ers of his book will be apt to think, from many &s;uch &s;lovenly notes as this, that both his <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> are pretty well matched.

<P>Here, indeed! we &s;ee our editor <HI>attempting</HI> to re&s;tore a pa&s;|&s;age, which appears to him corrupt.&mdash;Mark the &s;ucce&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P><Q><HI>To &s;ee a king transformed to a knot!] Knot</HI> has no &s;en&s;e that can &s;uit this place. We may read <HI>&s;ot.</HI> The rhymes in this play are &s;uch as that <HI>&s;at</HI> and <HI>&s;ot</HI> may be well enough admitted.</Q></P>
<P>What! have you lo&s;t your <HI>hearing</HI> and <HI>judgment</HI> too, Mr. Editor, as well as your <HI>memory</HI> and <HI>invention?</HI>&mdash;Do you not know that even <HI>&s;ot</HI> and <HI>&s;ot</HI> cannot be admitted into any ver&s;e as Engli&s;h rhymes; and do you think the matter mended with <HI>&s;ot</HI> and <HI>&s;at?</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, do you &s;ee no impropriety in Biron's calling the King, to his face, a blockhood or fool, becau&s;e truly he was in love; e&s;pecially when he is con&s;cious he is him&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation? Add to this, that &s;o gro&s;s an expre&s;&s;ion is to|tally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fine &s;train of raillery that runs through the whole of his &s;peech. This attempt, therefore, of our editor at <HI>re&s;toration,</HI> is evidently a very unlucky one, and is excu&s;able only as the un&s;uce&s;sful endeavour of <HI>mode&s;t indu&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>But why doth Dr. John&s;on conclude this pa&s;&s;age to be cor|rupted? If he thinks the rhymes <HI>&s;ot</HI> and <HI>&s;at</HI> admi&s;&s;ible, &s;urely he can have no objection to our pronouncing <HI>&s;at</HI> after the broad ortho&euml;py of the vulgar; in which ca&s;e it would be a much le&s;s exceptionable rhyme to <HI>knot</HI> than what he is willing
<PB N="84" REF="99">
to admit.&mdash;But he &s;ays,
<Q><HI>knot</HI> hath no &s;en&s;e that can &s;uit this place.</Q>
He might have found, however, by turning to almo&s;t any dictionary, excepting his own, that a <HI>knot</HI> is a &s;mall bird, well known in many parts of England, and is called <HI>avis Canuti</HI> by the naturali&s;ts; as it is &s;aid, becau&s;e king Canutus was very fond of &s;uch birds. It is, indeed, a delicious kind of water-fowl. Now, as Biron hath &s;aid but ju&s;t before, &s;peaking of the King,
<Q>Shot, by heav'n! proceed, &s;weet Cupid; thou ha&s;t thumpt him with thy <HI>bird-bolt</HI> under the left pap;</Q>
I cannot, for my part, &s;ee any objection to his comparing him in this pa&s;&s;age to a wounded <HI>knot.</HI> If my readers do, I have done. They will do me the ju&s;tice, however, to own, that, if I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Dr. John&s;on's <HI>ingenuity</HI> and <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> I &s;hew at lea&s;t as much <HI>indu&s;try</HI> in defending the text of Shake|&s;peare, as he does in pulling it to pieces.</P>

<Q>Much le&s;s elegant than the pre&s;ent reading.</Q>
<P>Undoubtedly it is: and I have here only to a&s;k Dr. John|&s;on, why he excludes the notes of Theobald, when they have been &s;ufficiently exploded by other writers; and yet pe&s;ters his readers with tho&s;e of Dr. Warburton, which &s;tand exactly in the &s;ame predicament?</P>

<P>Here we have another article of Dr. John&s;on's critical creed. It is certain that, whether <HI>me</HI> be in or out, is, in this place, of very little con&s;equence; but I &s;o much revere the text of Shake&s;peare, that, without I &s;ee an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for it, I will never defile it with a blot. It &s;eems as if the very name of <HI>John&s;on</HI> was fated to ca&s;t invidious reflections on that of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>; as if it was malignantly formed to ab&s;orb tho rays diffu&s;ed by &s;uperior lu&s;tre, and enviou&s;ly to fully, with a reflected gloom, the fountain of its own light.&mdash;This &s;cheme of blotting-out was originally &s;ugge&s;ted by a <HI>John&s;on</HI>; who,
<PB N="86" REF="101">
when the players made their boa&s;t, in honour of Shake&s;peare, that he never blotted out a line, replied,
<Q>Would he had blotted out a thou&s;and.</Q>
This was BEN <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who only expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h that Shake&s;peare had done, what SAM <HI>John&s;on</HI> boldly determined to do for him. For it is to be ob|&s;erved, that here was no <HI>tenderne&s;s due to living reputation</HI> to &s;top his hand; and he might think to indulge him&s;elf SAFELY in the <HI>innocent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a dead poet's preten&s;ions to re|nown</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. John&s;on's Preface.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If it be not owing to &s;ome &s;uch antipathy or inviduous in|fluence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the names of John&s;on and Shake|&s;peare, to what el&s;e can we impute Dr. John&s;on's objection to the harmle&s;s <HI>me</HI> in the above pa&s;&s;age! He very po&s;&s;ibly cannot find any u&s;e for it. But if we con&s;ider that the whole line is a mere exclamation; te&s;tifying the clown's &s;urprize at hearing Autolicus cry out, and &s;eeing him lie groveling on the earth. Had he &s;aid <HI>In the name of</HI> HEAVEN&mdash;or, <HI>In the name of</HI> MERCY&mdash;the line, however bordering on profa|nity, would have pa&s;t: but nothing is more common than for con&s;cientious people to check them&s;elves in the middle of &s;uch exclamations, or to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome innocent word in the place of the exceptionable one. Again, if any objection be made to the &s;uppo&s;ition of the Clown's &s;topping in the middle of the word <HI>mercy</HI>; let us take another view of the exclama|tion, and admit the word <HI>me</HI> to &s;tand as a per&s;onal pronoun. It is notorious that per&s;ons, who, as Hot&s;pur &s;ays,
<Q>&s;wear like comfit-maker's wives, and give &s;uch &s;arcenet &s;ecurity for their oaths, as, <HI>in good &s;ooth&mdash;as true as I live&mdash;as God &s;hall mend me</HI>&mdash;and <HI>as &s;ure as I live.</HI></Q>
I &s;ay it is very common for the&s;e uncommon &s;wearers, who cannot gulp down or dige&s;t a <HI>good mouth-filling oath,</HI> to prote&s;t <HI>upon their</HI> WORD. Now I cannot &s;ee why a per&s;on, who, to avoid a profane oath, &s;hould prote&s;t <HI>upon his</HI> WORD, might not, with
<PB N="87" REF="102">
equal propriety, in order to avoid a profane exclamation, cry out <HI>in his</HI> NAME. Admitting this, the Clown, in&s;tead of crying out in the name of heav'n, exclaimed in the name of him&s;elf; viz. <HI>l' th'</HI> NAME <HI>of me.</HI>&mdash;And this expre&s;&s;ion may &s;urely pa&s;s among expletives of this kind, as well as <HI>for the</HI> SOUL <HI>of me&mdash;for the</HI> LIFE <HI>of me&mdash;for the</HI> HEART <HI>of me,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;After all, whether I have convinced the reader or not, of the propriety of letting <HI>me</HI> &s;tand in the text, I mu&s;t have &s;ome better rea&s;on given ME for expunging it, than the <HI>ip&s;e-credidit</HI> of a JOHNSON.</P>

<P>Here Dr. John&s;on hath found Shake&s;peare tripping again.&mdash;Hear what he &s;ays.</P>
<P><Q><HI>His work &s;o noble, &amp;c.</HI>] It is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to rid his mind of his profe&s;&s;ion. The author&s;hip of Shake&s;peare has &s;upplied him with a metaphor, which, rather than he would lo&s;e it, he has put, with no great propriety, into the mouth of a country maid. Thinking of his own works, his mind pa&s;&s;ed naturally to the binder. I am glad he has no hint at an editor.</Q></P>
<P>We have here al&s;o, another aukward attempt of our editor at wit and plea&s;antry. But, why wilt thou, Dr. John&s;on, per&s;i&s;t thus in playing at bob-cherry, when the prize hangeth &s;o high above thine head, and &s;uch a weight of lead is in|cumbent on thy heels? I have already advi&s;ed thee, in the fullne&s;s of my heart, and, as Cicero &s;ays, non otii abun|danti&acirc;, &s;ed amoris erga te, not to be &s;o forward to di&s;play thy wit. I told thee before, and I tell thee again, thou ha&s;t it not in thee, being as unable to divert the reader with thy plea&s;antry, as to convince him of Shake&s;peare's impropriety.&mdash;Again, why, Dr. John&s;on, art thou glad that Shake&s;peare
<PB N="88" REF="103">
hath no hint at an editor? Do&s;t thou think he would have thrown out any cen&s;ures that might reach <HI>thee?</HI>&mdash;No&mdash;that incomparable bard was, as thou &s;aye&s;t, the poet of nature, and drew his characters from, the life: and nature had not produced in that age &s;o arrogant, and at the &s;ame time &s;o dull an animal, as the pre&s;ent commentator on Shake&s;peare. There were pedants and pedagogues, it is true, in his day; he has depicted an Holofernes and a Sir Hugh Evans. But the&s;e were &s;light excre&s;cences, mu&s;hrooms, champignons, that pe|ri&s;hed as the &s;moke of the dunghil evaporated, which reared them. A modern editor of Shake&s;peare is, on the contrary, a fungus attached to an oak; a male agaric of the mo&s;t a&s;|tringent kind, that, while it disfigures its form, may la&s;t for ages to di&s;grace the parent of its being.</P>
<P>But, to lay a&s;ide metaphor; not Burgerdi&s;chius, Gronovius, nor any one of the whole tribe of Dutch commentators, from the fir&s;t of them to the la&s;t, hath proceeded through his au|thor with more phlegm and frigidity, than Dr. John&s;on hath gone through Shake&s;peare <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And here lies the difference between Dr. Warburton and Dr. John&s;on, who&s;e commentaries I place both on a footing with re|gard to their utility, as they are them&s;elves pretty equal with re&s;pect to that arrogance with which they have treated the public, the liv|ing patrons of Shake&s;peare. In the commentary of Dr. Warburton, however, we have all the fire and &s;pirit of a re&s;tif imagination, bridled in by as perver&s;e an under&s;tanding: whereas, in that of Dr. John&s;on, we &s;ee but too plainly the waywardne&s;s of &s;ene&s;cence &s;truggling with the weakne&s;s of puerility.</P>
<P>It may be thought &s;trange that I &s;hould treat Dr. John&s;on's pre|ten&s;ions to wit &s;o contemptuou&s;ly, when it is notorious that his bons-mots have been con&s;tantly repeated for the&s;e ten years pa&s;t in taverns and in coffeehou&s;es, at dinners, and over tea-tables, to the great gratification of his admirers, and the edification of their hear|ers. Nay, it is well known, that a certain literary projector, ex|cited by the &s;ucce&s;s of BEN <HI>John&s;on's</HI> je&s;ts, had &s;chemed the publi|cation of the <HI>John&s;oniana,</HI> under the name of our editor, intending to in&s;ert on his title page, in&s;tead of <HI>O rare</HI> BEN! <HI>O brave</HI> SAM!&mdash;But I know not how, yet &s;o it happened, that, upon enquiry, the projector could not mu&s;ter up above a dozen <HI>genuine</HI> jokes worth printing.

<P>Mr. John&s;on, being &s;ent for, by order of the king, to write the Hi&s;tory of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick; replied, with great humour and loyalty, to the gentleman who propo&s;ed it, by &s;aying, <HI>What! Sir, is there no &s;coundrel author in England but my&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on, being offered a pen&s;ion by his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, in return for the above in&s;tance of his loyalty, he, notwith&s;tanding his former railing at placemen and pen&s;ioners, very wittily and wi&s;ely &s;aid&mdash;<HI>nothing</HI>; but growled and TOOK IT.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on having, on a nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, turned him&s;elf to|ward the wall, in one of the &s;treets of Oxford, was reminded by his companion, that he had indecently placed him&s;elf ju&s;t oppo&s;ite a window where &s;ome young ladies were drinking tea: on which Mr. John&s;on, p&mdash;f&mdash;g on, wittily and delicately replied, <HI>Sir, it is the</HI> OFFICE <HI>of Nature, and I &s;hall</HI> DISCHARGE <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>At another time, Mr. John&s;on, being in company where &s;ome per&s;ons were di&s;puting about the doctrine of the Trinity, he ro&s;e up from his chair, and <HI>ingeniou&s;ly</HI> decided the di&s;pute at once, by clenching his fi&s;t, and threatening to <HI>knock the fir&s;t per&s;on down, who, in his pre&s;ence, &s;hould ca&s;t infidel reflections on his friend Athana&s;ius.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame company, he was al&s;o heard mo&s;t divertingly to af|firm, that <HI>The man mu&s;t be an</HI> ATHEIST <HI>of the deepe&s;t dye, who did not believe in the</HI> COCK-LANE GHOST.</P>
<P>At various times and places, he hath been heard al&s;o to drop the following exqui&s;ite &s;trokes of wit and humour.&mdash;<HI>Sir, Sir, the fellow is a fool.&mdash;Sir, the man is a blockhead.&mdash;The ra&s;cal is an Athei&s;t.&mdash;There are but three good lines in all</HI> CHURCHILL's <HI>&s;atires, and two of them he &s;tole from my</HI> LONDON.&mdash;<HI>Shake&s;peare a poet! Sir, he never wrote a line of poetry in his life. An o&s;tler! Sir, a</HI> VARLET, <HI>that u&s;ed to hold gentlemen's hor&s;es at the play-hou&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, and a few other &s;trokes, equally pointed and humorous, being all the undertaker of the above project could pick up; and as the humour even of the&s;e depended greatly on a certain motion of the head peculiar to Dr. John&s;on, which cannot be committed to paper, it was judged advi&s;eable to drop the &s;cheme: &s;o that I hope I &s;tand excu&s;ed, if I do not place Dr. John&s;on's wittici&s;ms among the <HI>anas,</HI> or think him upon a &s;ooting even with Joe Miller, or his own name-&s;ake Ben.</P>

<P>To return to Dr. John&s;on's annotation, and the more par|ticular defence of Shake&s;peare's text.</P>
<P>The editor hath here charged the poet with being guilty of an impropriety in making a country maid talk like an author. But how doth Dr. John&s;on know that this is really the ca&s;e? How doth it appear, from the words of the text, that the al|lu&s;ion he charges on Shake&s;peare is at all intended?&mdash;That Perdita could know nothing about book-binding, is taken for granted; this being the very circum&s;tance, on which the charge of impropriety is founded. But it does not appear, notwith&s;tanding Dr. John&s;on imputes this impropriety to Shake&s;peare's profe&s;&s;ion, that the poet him&s;elf was much ver&s;ed in the matter. It is very little likely that a writer, who confe&s;&s;edly took &s;o little care about the <HI>printing</HI> of his works, and has <HI>no hint at an editor,</HI> &s;hould yet have his head &s;o full of a <HI>book-binder.</HI> Dr. John&s;on is plea&s;ed, for the honour I &s;uppo&s;e of our profe&s;&s;ion, to rank Shake&s;peare among the livery-men of our company. But, though I honour my pro|fe&s;&s;ion as being the mo&s;t liberal of all others, though I honour the immortal memory of Shake&s;peare &s;till more, yet I re&s;pect the <HI>truth</HI> mo&s;t of all. It does not appear that the term <HI>au|thor&s;hip</HI> can be applied with any propriety to Shake&s;peare; for, though he wrote for the &s;tage, I find no good authority for &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;old his copies, or transferred his right in them, to book&s;ellers; and he only is an author by <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> who writes for the TRADE.&mdash;No&mdash;To the honour of the gentlemen of the &s;tage, Shake&s;peare was by <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> a PLAYER; and I have no better rea&s;on, than his knowing every thing, to &s;uppo&s;e he knew that a book-binder exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>To come now to <HI>verbal</HI> critici&s;m. A piece of <HI>work vilely bound up,</HI> mu&s;t, according to Dr. John&s;on, nece&s;&s;arily mean a <HI>book meanly bound.</HI> But why &s;o? Neither the words <HI>work</HI> nor <HI>bound up</HI> are idiomatical, when applied to book-binding.
<PB N="91" REF="106">
In the fir&s;t place, we do not call the writings of an author his <HI>work,</HI> but his <HI>works.</HI> And, though &s;ometimes, in &s;peak|ing of the &s;everal &s;heets of a book, or the different volumes of an author's works, we may talk of <HI>binding</HI> them <HI>up</HI>; yet, &s;peaking of a <HI>book</HI> in the &s;ingular number, we talk always of its being <HI>bound</HI> merely; not of its being <HI>bound up.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, the term <HI>bind up</HI> is applicable to various works of hu&s;bandry, and &s;uch kinds of employment as a country maid might well be &s;uppo&s;ed acquainted with. Add to this, that the term <HI>bound up</HI> has a peculiar propriety in the pa&s;&s;age before us, as it is oppo&s;ed to <HI>prank'd up,</HI> a few lines above. The reader will remember, that Perdita, the country maid, is dre&s;&s;ed like a prince&s;s; or, as &s;he &s;ays, <HI>mo&s;t godde&s;s|like prank'd up</HI>; and Florizel, the real prince, is di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a clown. Now it is ob&s;ervable that, as the &s;u|perb dre&s;&s;es of the rich and gay were fa&s;tened together by or|namental brooches, ouches, knots of ribbons, &amp;c. &s;o the coar&s;er garments of the poor and &s;imple were fa&s;tened toge|ther, and tied with &s;trings or leathern thongs. And hence Perdita might very properly &s;ay, that the prince, in his <HI>&s;wain's wearing,</HI> was vilely <HI>bound up</HI>; without having any more allu|&s;ion to the <HI>binding</HI> of a book than to the <HI>binding up</HI> of a wheat|&s;heaf. But, becau&s;e &s;he has called the &s;on the father's <HI>work,</HI> without any impropriety in the line before, &s;he mu&s;t in this truly allude to <HI>book-binding:</HI> though, were it &s;o, &s;he mu&s;t be guilty of as great an impropriety in the application of her allu&s;ion. For why an author &s;hould be &s;o terribly angry, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, at accidentally &s;eeing his works meanly bound, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e; as I conceive neither his intere&s;t nor his reputation can be at all affected by the difference between calve's &s;kin and &s;heep's leather.</P>

</SP></Q>
<P><HI>It's dry, Sir.</HI>] What is the je&s;t of a <HI>dry hand,</HI> I know not any better than Sir Andrew. It may po&s;&s;ibly mean a hand with no money in it; or, according to the rules of <HI>phy&s;iog|nomy,</HI> &s;he may intend to in&s;inuate, that it is not a lover's hand, a moi&s;t hand being vulgarly accounted a &s;ign of an amorous con&s;titution.</P></Q>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, indeed, that our editor's &s;agacity is frequently at fault when a je&s;t is in the wind. The bringing <HI>the hand to the buttery-bar, and letting it drink,</HI> is a proverbial phra&s;e among forward Abigails, to a&s;k at once for a ki&s;s and a pre&s;ent. Sir Andrew's &s;lowne&s;s of comprehen&s;ion in this particular, gave her a ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion, at once, of his frigidity and avarice.&mdash;She therefore calls his hand dry: the moi&s;tne&s;s of the hand being a &s;ign of liberality, as well in matters of love as money. Thus Othello to De&s;demona,
<Q><L>Give me your hand. This hand is moi&s;t, my lady.</L>

Old Fore&s;ight, in Love for Love, de&s;cribes his wife al&s;o as hav|ing a mole upon her lip, with a <HI>moi&s;t palm,</HI> and an open li|berality on the mount of Venus.&mdash;Dr. John&s;on need not, therefore, have expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much caution of &s;u&s;pecting this to be the truth of the matter. There is one thing, how|ever, he &s;hould have attended to; and this is, that the whole of this in&s;inuation is founded rather on the rules of <HI>palmi&s;try</HI> than <HI>phy&s;iognomy:</HI> for, though the etymology of the latter word be known to the learned, who may admit of &s;uch lati|tude of expre&s;&s;ion, I do not remember ever to have &s;een <HI>phy|&s;iognomy</HI> made u&s;e of before by an Engli&s;h writer to &s;ignify any information of this kind, but that which is acquired from the features of the face. So that Marian's finding out any thing from St. Andrew's <HI>palm,</HI> by the rules of <HI>phy&s;iognomy,</HI> mu&s;t appear to an unlearned reader, as ab&s;urd as if &s;he had read his folly in his <HI>phyz</HI> by the rules of <HI>palmi&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>To check the &s;mile, however, of the unlearned reader, and to pre&s;erve the <HI>veneration</HI> due to cramp words and crooked letters, he is to know that <HI>phyz</HI> doth not come from <GAP DESC="foreign"> but from a le&s;s ancient and honourable &s;tock, the French <HI>vi|&s;age,</HI> or the Italian <HI>vi&s;o.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="96" REF="111">I know not how many, or if all, the editions authorize this reading of <HI>&s;ink-a-pace.</HI> Our editor adopts it, and pa&s;&s;es it over in &s;ilence, like the re&s;t of the commentators. I have ever looked upon it, however, as &s;o vile a blot in this ad|mirable piece of raillery of Sir Toby's, that I cannot help imputing it to the interpolation of &s;ome tran&s;criber, who ima|gined there was an excellent joke in <HI>making water into a</HI> SINK-A-PACE. The conceit, however, is &s;o low and vile, that I cannot give into the notion that Shake&s;peare, fond as he &s;eems of punning and playing upon words, was the author of it. I am confirmed in this opinion al&s;o by reflecting, that the attention of the reader is diverted from the real humour of the pa&s;&s;age, by this horrid conundrum. Sir Toby, in car|rying his ridicule of poor Ague-cheek's dancing-accompli&s;h|ments to the highe&s;t pitch, proceeds &s;o far as to tell him, he would not &s;tand &s;till on the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, even to make water; but that he might not betray him&s;elf, even to this fool, by talking of ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibilities, he fixes on a grave, flow, and even hobbling kind of dance, the <HI>cinque|pace,</HI> for this &s;u&s;picious occa&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The gravity and interruptions of this dance are, indeed, par|ticularly pointed out by Shake&s;peare on another occa&s;ion.
<Q>Woo|ing, wedding, and repenting, is a Scotch jigg, a mea&s;ure, and a cinque-pace. The fir&s;t &s;uit is hot and ha&s;ty like a Scotch jigg, and full as fanta&s;tical; the wedding mannerly and mode&s;t, as a mea&s;ure full of &s;tate and gravity; and then comes repentance, and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace.</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>&mdash;Will you go an-heirs?</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>Dr. Warburton's note on this pa&s;&s;age, printed without any animadver&s;ion of our editor, runs thus;</P>
<P><Q><HI>Will you go</HI> AN HEIRS?] This non&s;en&s;e is &s;poken to Shal|low. We &s;hould read, <HI>Will you go</HI> ON, HERIS? <HI>i. e.</HI> Will you go on, Ma&s;ter? <HI>Heris,</HI> an old Scotch word for ma|&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>What the pre&s;ent editor under&s;tands by this word, or whether he under&s;tands any thing by it, is not ea&s;ily deter|mined, as he hath thought proper to leave it in this &s;ituation, doubtle&s;s for the rea&s;on given above; viz. its being natural for the reader to delight more in what he may find out of him&s;elf, than what the &s;cholia&s;t may tell him. For my part, however, I apprehend the mere Engli&s;h reader would be glad of &s;ome little a&s;&s;i&s;tance here, e&s;pecially as Dr. John&s;on does not &s;eem to be &s;atisfied with Dr. Warburton's note.&mdash;The author of the Revi&s;al appears al&s;o to be of the &s;ame opinion,
<PB N="100" REF="115">
and therefore hath given his readers the following remarks on this controverted pa&s;&s;age.
<Q><HI>Will you go on, Heris?</HI> The non&s;en&s;e of the former editions was, 'Will you go <HI>an heirs?</HI>' Mr. Warburton a&s;&s;ures us, '<HI>heris</HI> is an old Scotch word for ma&s;ter.' It may be &s;o for ought I know. But as my ex|perience hath taught me &s;ome di&s;tru&s;t of this gentleman's po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions in matters of this nature, I mu&s;t beg leave to doubt of it. Be&s;ides, this word, according to this in|terpetation of it, is of the &s;ingular number, and yet is ad|dre&s;&s;ed, not to Ford, but to Page and Shallow, as is evi|dent from what immediately follows. I &s;ee no rea&s;on neither why either Shake&s;peare, or mine ho&s;t of the Garter, &s;hould chu&s;e to talk old Scotch, and therefore I &s;hould rather &s;up|po&s;e our poet might have written, 'Will you go on, <HI>hearts?</HI>' An expre&s;&s;ion &s;uited to the jovial character of mine ho&s;t, and not very different in appearance from the common reading, e&s;pecially when &s;pelled as it anciently was, <HI>herts.</HI> Mr. Theobald's conjectures, 'Will you go on <HI>here?</HI>' or Will you go, <HI>mynheirs?</HI>' carry with them, in my opinion, very little probability.</Q></P>
<P>It is very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by the Revi&s;er, that there is no ob|vious rea&s;on for mine ho&s;t of the Garter to &s;peak old Scotch; but if we con&s;ider that he is a German, I do not &s;ee why the &s;cholia&s;t &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e Theobald's la&s;t emendation impro|bable. Nothing is more likely, I think, than for him now and then to drop a word of high or low Dutch. It is true that the word <HI>mynheirs</HI> is properly neither one nor the other: for neither the Dutch nor the German make the plural of <HI>heer</HI> or <HI>herr</HI> end in <HI>s.</HI> Add to this, that they &s;eldom u&s;e the per&s;onal pronoun &s;ingular with the noun plural. When they acco&s;t a &s;ingle per&s;on with the title of <HI>my Lord</HI> or <HI>Sir,</HI> it is <HI>Mynheer</HI> or <HI>Mein herr</HI>; but when they addre&s;s more than one with the title of <HI>Lords</HI> or <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the pronoun is generally dropped, and they &s;ay <HI>Heeren</HI> or <HI>Herren.</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;ee no manner of impropriety in &s;uppo&s;ing our ho&s;t to be either above or below &s;uch idiomatical and grammatical
<PB N="101" REF="116">
niceties: in which ca&s;e he might not only join the &s;ingular pronoun with the plural noun (as the Engli&s;h &s;ay my Lords, as well as my Lord) but al&s;o give the plural noun their common ending in Engli&s;h; &s;o that if Theobald had &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>myn|heers,</HI> it might have pa&s;ted. But if it be in&s;i&s;ted on, that our ho&s;t of the Garter &s;hall &s;peak properly and elegantly, the pa&s;|&s;age mu&s;t &s;tand thus. "Will you go on, <HI>heeren,</HI> or <HI>herren.</HI>" The reader may take which he likes be&s;t, both meaning &s;im|ply, <HI>Will you go on, gentlemen?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I cannot help referring, on this occa&s;ion, to a pa&s;&s;age in our editor's preface; where, among other excu&s;es for doing &s;o little, after having promi&s;ed &s;o much, he hath the follow|ing curious pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<P><Q>If my readings are of little value, they have not been o&s;tentatiou&s;ly di&s;played, or importunately obtruded. I could have written longer notes; for the art of writing notes is not of difficult attainment. The work is performed, fir&s;t by railing at the &s;tupidity, negligence, ignorance, and a&s;i|nine ta&s;tele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the former editors, and &s;hewing, from all that goes before, and all that follows, the inelegance and ab&s;urdity of the old reading; then by propo&s;ing &s;ome|thing, which, to &s;uperficial readers, would &s;eem &s;pecious, but which the editor rejects with indignation; then by <HI>pro|ducing the true reading,</HI> with a long paraphra&s;e, and con|cluding with <HI>loud</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. John&s;on is here expre&s;ly de&s;cribing the method of <HI>writing</HI> annotations.

<P>Tho' Page be a &s;ecure fool, and &s;tand &s;o firmly on his wife's fealty, yet I cannot put off my opinion &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>All the copies, &s;ays Dr. Warburton, read <HI>&s;tand &s;o firmly on his wife's</HI> FRAILTY: but to this reading, Mr. Theobald ob|jected.
<Q>No, &s;urely; <HI>Page</HI> &s;tood tightly to the opinion of her hone&s;ty, and would not entertain a thought of her be|ing <HI>frail.</HI> I have therefore ventured to &s;ub&s;titute a word corre&s;pondent to the &s;en&s;e required, and one which our poet frequently u&s;es to &s;ignify conjugal fidelity.</Q>
&mdash;In reply to this note, Dr. Warburton &s;ays,
<Q>Mr. Theobald has no conception how any man could &s;tand firmly on his wife's <HI>frailty.</HI> And why? Becau&s;e he had no conception how he could &s;tand upon it, without knowing what it was. But if I tell a &s;tranger that the bridge he is about to cro&s;s is rotten, and he believes it not, but will go on, may I not &s;ay, when I &s;ee him upon it, that he &s;tands firmly on a rotten plank? yet he has changed <HI>frailty</HI> for <HI>fealty,</HI> and the Oxford editor has followed him. But they took the phra&s;e, <HI>to &s;tand firmly on,</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>to in&s;i&s;t</HI> upon; whereas it &s;ignifies to <HI>re&s;t upon</HI>; which the character of a <HI>&s;ecure fool,</HI> given to him, &s;hews. So that the common reading has an elegance that would be lo&s;t in the alteration.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this fine rea&s;oning, however, of Dr. War|burton, the pre&s;ent editor hath judiciou&s;ly &s;tuck by Theobald's emendation in the text, though he is perfectly &s;ilent about it in his notes. It happens, neverthele&s;s, very unluckily for Dr. John&s;on, that he hath quoted this very pa&s;&s;age in his
<PB N="103" REF="118">

</SP></Q>
<P>In a note on this pa&s;&s;age, our editor hath di&s;played his critical acumen mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly; as indeed mo&s;t of Shake&s;peare's editors do, when they venture an inch beyond the &s;ervile bounds of <HI>verbal</HI> critici&s;m. Our poet is univer&s;ally allowed to be one of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters in de&s;cribing the effects, as well as the greate&s;t judge of the operation, of the pa&s;&s;ions, that ever exi&s;ted. And yet is he here arraigned for an error, which affects him as an accurate ob&s;erver of human nature, and a
<PB N="104" REF="119">
ju&s;t delineator of the actions of mankind, his mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hing characteri&s;tics. The note here follows:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Eleven o'clock.</HI>] Ford &s;hould rather have &s;aid <HI>ten o'clock</HI>; the time was between ten and eleven; and his impatient &s;u&s;picion was not likely to &s;tay beyond the time.</Q></P>
<P>No; Dr. John&s;on.&mdash;<HI>Ford</HI> &s;hould neither be made to &s;ay <HI>ten</HI> nor <HI>eleven</HI> o'clock: he is not &s;peaking of the time, at which Fal&s;taff is to meet his wife; but of the time then pre&s;ent, which is <HI>&s;even</HI> o'clock, ju&s;t <HI>three hours,</HI> as he expre&s;ly ob&s;erves, from the earlie&s;t time of the appointment. So that, &s;o far is his impatient &s;u&s;picion from &s;taying beyond the time of their intended meeting, that it &s;eems to urge him in&s;tantly to go about to defeat the &s;uppo&s;ed purpo&s;es of it.&mdash;<HI>I will about it&mdash;better</HI> THREE HOURS <HI>too &s;oon than a minute too late.</HI>&mdash;Why &s;hould he particularly mention <HI>three</HI> hours rather than any in|definite time, unle&s;s for the rea&s;on given? I know not how far the copies may authorize this reading; but the mi&s;take might ea&s;ily be made by the fir&s;t tran&s;cribers, and be &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively tran&s;mitted through the pre&s;s uncorrected, as the &s;en&s;e was not very palpably affected by it. By reading <HI>&s;even</HI> for <HI>eleven,</HI> however, we deliver Shake&s;peare from the per&s;ecution of his annotator, and give a beauty and propriety to the pa&s;|&s;age, which at pre&s;ent is doubtle&s;s exceptionable. I would advi&s;e the actor al&s;o, who may perform this part for the fu|ture, to look at his watch, when he repeats this &s;entence; for that was evidently the author's intention, as appears by the intimation of his having &s;till <HI>three hours good,</HI> in which to take proper mea&s;ures to &s;urpri&s;e the parties. He did not mean, as is plain by the &s;equel, to prevent or hinder their meeting, but to be before-hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The word <HI>prevent</HI> being here u&s;ed, perhaps nearly, though not altogether in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in our liturgy: when we &s;ay, <HI>O Lord prevent us in all our doings.</HI> It may indeed be conceived to carry a double meaning; viz. Ford's &s;imply getting the &s;tart of the parties, in order to detect and expo&s;e them; or, as is above hinted, to prevent or hinder his being made a cuckold. But I think he
<PB N="105" REF="120">&s;eems to &s;o be well a&s;&s;ured of his having been cuckolded by &s;omebody or other, that a &s;ingle prevention of this kind could be of little con&s;ideration with him. It were indeed to little purpo&s;e, if his opi|nion of his wife were ju&s;tly founded, and his &s;arca&s;m on the &s;ex in general were true; i. e. that
<Q>what they think in their hearts they <HI>may</HI> effect, they will break their hearts but they <HI>will</HI> effect.</Q></P>
<PB N="104" REF="119"></NOTE> with them in the means of

detection. Add to all this, that although, in his rage, he &s;ays, ju&s;t before, <HI>the hour is fixt,</HI> yet no one <HI>particular hour</HI> was preci&s;ely named for the intended rendezvous; it was not at ten, nor at eleven, but between ten and eleven; &s;o that the rea&s;on Dr. John&s;on gives, why he &s;hould not &s;ay <HI>eleven,</HI> is in it&s;elf &s;ufficient to prove he &s;hould &s;ay neither.</P>

<P>It was an ancient cu&s;tom among the literati all over Eu|rope, and is &s;till kept up abroad, particularly in Holland and Germany, for men of letters to keep a book, which they call an <HI>album,</HI> &s;o denominated from a &s;imilar application of that word, among the ancient Romans, to a matricular regi&s;ter or mu&s;ter-roll of names. This book, or books, contained in like manner a li&s;t of the names of the owner's friends, ad|mirers or acquaintance; who, in &s;ub&s;cribing their names in
<PB N="109" REF="124">
his <HI>album,</HI> generally u&s;ed to preface them with &s;ome compli|ment or device, in pro&s;e or ver&s;e, each after his own man|ner. It was very natural, therefore, for them to &s;ay, in &s;peak|ing of their favourites or friends, that they were in their books; and of their enemies, that they were not in their books, or out of their books. Nay, I know not if it would be at all unna|tural for re&s;entful per&s;ons to &s;trike out the names of tho&s;e who might afterwards offend them, in order to &s;hew their &s;pleen, and at the &s;ame time that they would not be obliged to &s;uch people for a compliment. I cannot help thinking al&s;o, that I di&s;cover a propriety in the me&s;&s;enger's u&s;ing this phra&s;e to Beatrice, as he might intend &s;arca&s;tically to in&s;inu|ate that, he imagined, by the &s;everity of her raillery again&s;t Benedict, that he was one who had paid no compliment to her beauty. But whether this propriety be imaginary or not, there is not the lea&s;t room for &s;uppo&s;ing that he meant to &s;ay Beatrice had not, according to Dr. John&s;on's explication, re|membered Benedict in the codicil of her will. It is, indeed, a thou&s;and to one if the la&s;t will and te&s;tament of the buxom Beatrice was written; and a much greater chance if it had co|dicils annexed to it.</P>

<P>Dr. John&s;on's note.
<Q>What is it <HI>to go to the world?</HI> per|haps to enter, by marriage, into a &s;ettled &s;tate: but why is the unmarried lady <HI>&s;un-burnt?</HI> I believe we &s;hould read, <HI>thus goes every one to the</HI> wood <HI>but I, and I am &s;un-burnt.</HI> Thus does every one but I find a &s;helter, and I am left ex|po&s;ed to wind and <HI>&s;un. The neare&s;t way to the wood,</HI> is a phra&s;e for the readie&s;t means to any end. It is &s;aid of a a woman, who accepts a wor&s;e match than tho&s;e which &s;he had refu&s;ed, that &s;he has pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>wood,</HI> and at la&s;t taken a crooked &s;tick.

<PB N="110" REF="125">
&s;omething to abate its confidence. Shake&s;peare, in All's well that ends well, u&s;es the phra&s;e, <HI>to go to the world,</HI> for <HI>marriage.</HI> So that my emendation depends only on the oppo&s;ition of <HI>wood</HI> to <HI>&s;un-burnt.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A very &s;light dependance, indeed, and by no means worthy &s;o prolix an illu&s;tration! Our editor, &s;urely, had lo&s;t him|&s;elf in a wood, or his wits were gone wool-gathering about the hedges while he penned it.&mdash;<HI>To go to the world,</HI> is to <HI>go into,</HI> to <HI>&s;ettle in, the world,</HI> which is u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed to be done in marriage. Thus the clown, in All's well that ends well, a&s;ks the Counte&s;s leave to marry I&s;abel.&mdash;<HI>If I have your lady&s;hip's good will to go to the</HI> world, <HI>I&s;abel the woman and I will do as we may.</HI>&mdash;That a <HI>wood</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary to give meaning to the word <HI>&s;un-burnt,</HI> I cannot admit. It is evident that Beatrice here &s;peaks ironically, and, perhaps, a little &s;arca&s;tically and peeri&s;hly, on the occa&s;ion of Hero's getting a hu&s;band before her. For it &s;eems that Hero was a brunette, and, in all probability, not &s;o fair nor &s;o fine a woman as Beatrice. At lea&s;t &s;o it is, if we may take Signior Benedict's word for it, who, &s;peaking of Hero, &s;ays,
<Q>She is too low for an high prai&s;e, too <HI>brown</HI> for a <HI>fair</HI> prai&s;e, and too little for a great prai&s;e:</Q>
whereas of her cou&s;in Beatrice he &s;peaks in a dif|ferent manner, and this even before he is tricked into falling in love with her, and while he boa&s;ts that
<Q>he can &s;ee with|out &s;pectacles.</Q>
Of her he &s;ays, after turning up his no&s;e, as it were, at the commendations given to the per&s;on of Hero,
<Q>There's her cou&s;in, if &s;he were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the fir&s;t of May doth the la&s;t of December.</Q>
Now, though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e Benedict to be a little partial, as having a &s;neaking kindne&s;s, though he will not own it, for this ami|able fury; yet it &s;eems clear that &s;he was fairer than Hero. It was very natural for her, therefore, to &s;ay ironically on this occa&s;ion,
<Q>Thus every one gets married but I.&mdash;Poor I am <HI>&s;unburn'd</HI>; i. e. not fair enough to attract the notice of

<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>good alone,</HI></L>

<HI>i. e.</HI> good is good, though there be no addition of title; and vilene&s;s is vilene&s;s, though there be. The Oxford editor, under&s;tanding nothing of this, &s;trikes out vilene&s;s, and puts in its place <HI>in't&s;elf.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;ays,
<Q>The pre&s;ent reading is certainly wrong; and, to confe&s;s the truth, I do not think Dr. Warburton's emendation right; yet I have nothing that I can propo&s;e with much confidence. Of all the conjectures that I can make, that which lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;es me is this:
<Q><L>&mdash;virtue alone,</L>
<L>Is good without a name; <HI>Helen</HI> is &s;o;</L></Q>
the re&s;t follows ea&s;ily by this change.</Q></P>
<P>The author of the Revi&s;al &s;eems to under&s;tand the pa&s;&s;age better than either of the doctorial critics ju&s;t mentioned. He tells us the common reading is,
<Q><L>&mdash;good alone</L>
<L>Is good <HI>without</HI> a name; vilene&s;s is &s;o:</L></Q>
<Q>the meaning of which, &s;ays he, one would imagine &s;hould be pretty plain. Good &s;ingly by it&s;elf, without the addi|tion of title, is good &s;till; it is the &s;ame thing with vile|ne&s;s. It takes its nature from it&s;elf, and not from exter|nal circum&s;tances, as title and the like. And this inter|pretation
<PB N="114" REF="129">
is given by the poet him&s;elf, in the lines imme|diately following,
<Q><L>The property by what it is &s;hould go,</L>
<L>Not by the title.</L></Q>
Notwith&s;tanding all this, Mr. Warburton mi&s;took the meaning, and then murdered the text.</Q></P>
<P>As to Dr. John&s;on's conjectural emendation, it &s;erves to no other purpo&s;e than to betray how barren he is at conjectures. I conceive, neverthele&s;s, that our editor hath re&s;tored the true pointing, though it differs from that of his rival &s;cho|lia&s;t. But whether this be due to cunning or good luck, I cannot pretend to &s;ay, unle&s;s I knew to whom to attribute the honour of correcting the pre&s;s, the editor or the printer. The meaning I think is obvious, and the pa&s;&s;age may be pa|raphra&s;ed thus: <HI>good</HI> by it&s;elf <HI>is good, and even &s;o, if unadorned by titles, vilene&s;s were vilene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I do not propo&s;e this improvement of the Revi&s;er's expla|nation with any great confidence, nor merely for the &s;ake of differing from that very &s;en&s;ible writer; but becau&s;e I think there is &s;ome little tautology in &s;aying <HI>good by it&s;elf</HI> is good, and then to add <HI>without</HI> a name; for certainly if it was <HI>by it|&s;elf,</HI> alone, it was <HI>without</HI> any thing el&s;e.</P>

<P>The commentators &s;eem to be &s;adly puzzled to explain this letter; the meaning of which could not po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;|taken by any one who &s;hould read the play quite through. Dr. Warburton's note runs thus:</P>
<P><Q><HI>When thou can&s;t get the ring upon my finger.</HI>] i. e. When thou can&s;t get the ring, which is on my finger, into thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>Dr. Warburton's explanation is undoubtedly as well founded as the Oxford editor's is &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent. Dr. John|&s;on, indeed, &s;ays, that he thinks
<Q>Dr. Warburton's explana|tion &s;ufficient; but, continues he, I once read it thus, <HI>When thou can&s;t get the ring upon</HI> THY <HI>finger, which never &s;hall come</HI> off MINE.</Q></P>

<PB N="116" REF="131">

<P>This <HI>piecing</HI> air, it is true, is very much of a <HI>piece</HI> with the re&s;t of our editor's annotations; but what he means by it, I cannot conceive; any more than I can find out what Dr. Warburton means by the <HI>perpetual motion</HI> of the air, which prevents it from being injured by piercing. In my opinion, however, the meaning of Shake&s;peare in this pa&s;&s;age is ob|vious. It is notorious that the epithet <HI>&s;till-piercing,</HI> or <HI>&s;ilently-piercing,</HI> is applicable to the air on more occa&s;ions than one. A cold air is a piercing air; and indeed, whether the air be cold or hot, it &s;ilently pierces or penetrates into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of place, and even the pores of many apparently &s;olid bodies. It is likewi&s;e notorious, that a cannon or mu&s;ket|ball whizzes or whi&s;tles as it pa&s;&s;es through or pierces the air; which being converted, poetica licentia, from the pa|tient to the agent, and vice ver&s;a, may, with great propriety, be &s;aid to <HI>&s;ing with piercing,</HI> i. e. with <HI>being pierced,</HI> though it <HI>pierces &s;ilently</HI> it&s;elf.

<Q><L>'Tis not the many oaths, that make the truth;</L>

i. e. If we &s;wear to an unholy purpo&s;e, the oath abides not, but is di&s;&s;olved in the making. This is an an&s;wer to the purpo&s;e. She &s;ubjoins the rea&s;on two or three lines after;
<Q><L>&mdash;this has no <HI>holding,</HI></L>
<L>To &s;wear by him, whom I prote&s;t to love;</L>
<L>That I will work again&s;t him.</L></Q>
<PB N="119" REF="134">
i. e. That oath can never hold, who&s;e &s;ubject is to offend and di&s;plea&s;e that being, whom I profe&s;s, in the act of &s;wearing by him, to love and reverence.&mdash;What may have mi&s;led the editors into the common reading was, per|haps, mi&s;taking Bertram's words above,
<Q>By love's own &s;weet con&s;traint,</Q>

<P>This note of Dr. Warburton's, the argument of which is as fal&s;e as the emendation propo&s;ed is con&s;trained and un|couth, is highly commended by the pre&s;ent editor. His an|notation is as follows:</P>
<P><Q>This is an acute and excellent conjecture, and I have done it the due honour of exalting it to the text; yet, methinks, there is &s;omething yet wanting.

Bertram means to enfore his &s;uit, by telling her, that he has bound him&s;elf to her, not by the petty prote&s;tations u&s;ual among lovers, but by vows of greater &s;olemnity. She then makes a proper and rational reply.</Q></P>
<P>Again, Dr. John&s;on conceives another part of the above quotation to be corrupt; which, as it may &s;omething affect
<PB N="120" REF="135">
the &s;en&s;e of the whole, I chu&s;e to take notice of here, altho' the editor con&s;iders it in a di&s;tinct note.</P>
<Q><L>To &s;wear by him whom I prote&s;t to love,</L>
<L>That I will work again&s;t him:</L></Q>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age like|wi&s;e
<Q>appears to me corrupt. She &s;wears not <HI>by</HI> him whom &s;he <HI>loves,</HI> but by <HI>Jupiter.</HI> I believe we may read <HI>to &s;wear</HI> to <HI>him.</HI> There is, &s;ays &s;he, no holding, no con&s;i&s;tency, in &s;wearing to one that <HI>I love him,</HI> when I &s;wear it only to <HI>in|jure</HI> him.</Q></P>
<P>But farther, Dr. John&s;on, on recon&s;idering this pa&s;&s;age, tells us, in his appendix, that
<Q>in the print of the old folio, it is doubtful whether it is <HI>Jove's</HI> or <HI>Love's,</HI> the characters being not di&s;tingui&s;hable. If it is read <HI>Love's,</HI> perhaps it may be &s;omething le&s;s difficult. I am &s;till at a lo&s;s.</Q>
&mdash;And &s;o, by this time, I pre&s;ume, is the reader. But, as the poet &s;ays,
<Q>Who &s;hall decide when doctors di&s;agree?</Q>
Doubtle&s;s nobody le&s;s than he that has been dubb'd or capt twice; and he may authoritatively plead the &s;ame right of pre-eminence over a &s;ingle graduate, as <HI>two</HI> marrow-puddings have prerogatively over <HI>one</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I hope none of the learned doctors of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin, nor even tho&s;e of Edinburgh, Gla&s;cow, or Lambeth, will be offended at the vulgarity of this compari&s;on. Had they been in|ve&s;ted, however, with their doctorial dignities at Rheims, Louvain, or Harderwyk, they would readily &s;ee into the propriety of com|paring a diploma to a marrow-pudding. It is, indeed, a choice &s;imile, but I cannot now tarry to illu&s;trate it.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>How far the author of the Revi&s;al may be qualified to de|termine this matter, I cannot pretend to &s;ay; being, to my regret, utterly unacquainted with the name and quality of that writer. But, as I think he hath explained this pa&s;&s;age better than either of the graduated gentlemen above quoted, I &s;hall not follow Dr. John&s;on's example, by cloathing his &s;entiments in different words, and pa&s;&s;ing them off as my own.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="136">The Revi&s;er's remarks on the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion, are as follow:
<Q><L>What is not holy, that we &s;wear, not 'bides,&mdash;</L>
<L>But take the High'&s;t to witne&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. War|burton
<Q>hath &s;o &s;trangely puzzled him&s;elf about this pa&s;&s;age, that he hath at la&s;t quite lo&s;t &s;ight of its drift and purpo&s;e, and given us one of the mo&s;t elaborate pieces of non&s;en&s;e to be found in his whole performance. The common reading, however,
<Q><L>What is not holy, that we &s;wear not by,</L>
<L>But take the High'&s;t to witne&s;s,</L></Q>
is, if he could have been content with it, extremely plain and clear. The &s;en&s;e is, We never &s;wear by what is not holy, but &s;wear by, or take to witne&s;s the highe&s;t, the di|vinity. The tenor of the rea&s;oning contained in the fol|lowing lines perfectly corre&s;ponds with this; if I &s;hould &s;wear by Jove's great attributes, that I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when you found by experience that I loved you ill, and was endeavouring to gain credit with you, in order to reduce you to your ruin! No, &s;urely, but you would conclude that I had no faith either in Jove or his attributes, and that my oaths were mere words of cour&s;e. For that oath can certainly have no tie upon us, which we &s;wear by him we profe&s;s to love and honour, when at the &s;ame time we give the &s;tronge&s;t proof of our di&s;belief in him, by pur&s;uing a cour&s;e, which we know will offend and di&s;honour him.</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P>The Revi&s;er is here very near the truth, but hath neither fully confuted Dr. Warburton, nor prevented the difficulties &s;ugge&s;ted by Dr. John&s;on. He is al&s;o mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing the words <HI>this has no holding</HI> to mean <HI>&s;uch an oath is not binding</HI>; &s;ince, be other matters as they may, nothing I think is plainer than that &s;he means, as Dr. John&s;on &s;ays, <HI>There is no con&s;i&s;tency.</HI> And this explanation of tho&s;e words, though
<PB N="122" REF="137">
it be our editor's own, is what militates again&s;t the alteration of <HI>by</HI> into <HI>to,</HI> as he propo&s;es; which alteration, however, is otherwi&s;e very plau&s;ible, if the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age had ab|&s;olutely required it.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee what we can make of it, without alteration.</P>
<P>Bertram tells Diana that he loves her, and he &s;wears to it <HI>By love's own &s;weet con&s;traint.</HI> No, &s;ays Dr. Warburton, this is no oath; he only &s;ays he loves her by love's own &s;weet con|&s;traint; having &s;aid in the preceding line, &s;peaking of Helena,
<Q><L>I was compell'd to her, but I love thee</L>
<L>By love's own con&s;traint.&mdash;</L></Q>
But what is this but &s;aying,
<Q><HI>I was compelled to love Helena</HI> by my father, <HI>but I was compelled to love thee</HI> by Love him|&s;elf.</Q>
Thus we &s;ee, it is &s;till as Fal&s;taff &s;ays, upon <HI>com|pul&s;ion</HI>; and if readings were as plenty as black-berries, I would adopt none of them upon compul&s;ion. Be&s;ides, it does not appear that Bertram loves Helena at all. It is very pre&s;umable that Bertram <HI>&s;wore,</HI> from Diana's taking him &s;o roundly to ta&s;k for the profanity of his oath. He &s;aid thus;
<Q><L><HI>I was</HI> COMPELL'D <HI>to</HI> her, but I LOVE thee&mdash;</L>
<L>By <HI>LOVE's OWN</HI> &s;weet con&s;traint&mdash;</L></Q>
i. e. I was forced to wed Helena, but thou art the woman I love.&mdash;She was my father's choice, thou art mine.&mdash;Yes, by all the powers of love, i. e. by that power which influ|enced my choice, thou art.&mdash;To which power, compared with the tyrannical authority of his father, he was very aptly and naturally induced to give the name of <HI>Love's own &s;weet con&s;traint.</HI></P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing he did not mean to &s;wear by the powers or power of love at this particular conjuncture, it appears, I think, pretty evident, that this was his u&s;ual oath, or mode of vowing. El&s;e, why &s;hould he an&s;wer, after being &s;o &s;e|verely
<PB N="123" REF="138">
&s;chooled about his not &s;wearing by the <HI>Highe&s;t,</HI> as the only holy object to &s;wear by,
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Love</HI> is <HI>holy.</HI></L>
<L>And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts,</L>
<L>That you do charge men with.</L></Q>
What then becomes of Dr. Warburton's <HI>acute and excellent conjecture,</HI> to which Dr. John&s;on <HI>hath done the due honour of exalting it to the text?</HI> Dr. Warburton &s;ays, that <HI>Diana is not accu&s;ing Bertram for &s;wearing by a Being not holy, but for &s;wearing to an unholy purpo&s;e.</HI> Indeed, &s;he is accu&s;ing him of both, and pleads the former as a proof of the latter. You cannot &s;wear, &s;ays &s;he, with any good de&s;ign, or to any good purpo&s;e, when you &s;wear by &s;uch profane objects. For, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the words <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>true</HI> are not here con|fined to the mere veracity of the terms of the oath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>But, as in Pandulph's &s;peech, in the play of King John, page 449, where <HI>truth,</HI> applied al&s;o, in like manner, to an oath, relates, as our editor him&s;elf ob&s;erves, to <HI>rectitude</HI> of conduct. Thus, when Diana &s;ays
<Q><L>'Tis not the many oaths that make the <HI>truth</HI>;</L>
<L>But the plain &s;ingle vow, that is vow'd <HI>true</HI>;</L></Q>
&s;he does not mean &s;imply that a multiplicity of oaths will not make that true which is otherwi&s;e fal&s;e; for this is not to be done at any rate; yet, what &s;he means to &s;ay is confe&s;&s;ely to be effected by
<Q>&mdash;the plain &s;ingle vow that is vow'd true.</Q>
What &s;he means, therefore, is this; <HI>a multiplicity of vague and pro|fane oaths</HI> will not ju&s;tify any immoral conduct or de&s;ign; but that any que&s;tionable de&s;ign is to be ju&s;tified only by the <HI>plain &s;ingle vow, that is vowed true</HI>; i. e. &s;worn in a regular and &s;acred manner. And hence &s;he proceeds to &s;ay,
<Q>What is not holy that we &s;wear not by, &amp;c.</Q></P></NOTE>. Diana did not doubt that Bertram had a love or a pa&s;&s;ion for her, according to the common acceptation of the term. It was to
<PB N="124" REF="139">
the other part of his vow that &s;he alludes; for he not only tells her he <HI>loves</HI> her; but
<Q><L>&mdash;will for ever</L>
<L>Do her all rights of &s;ervice.</L></Q>
To which &s;he an&s;wers,
<Q><L>Ay, &s;o you &s;erve us,</L>
<L>'Till we &s;erve you: but when you have our ro&s;es,</L>
<L>You barely leave our thorns to prick our&s;elves,</L>
<L>And mock us with our barene&s;s.</L></Q>
To this Bertram eagerly replies,
<Q>How have I &s;worn!</Q>
To which Diana as &s;hrewdly an&s;wers&mdash;
<Q>'Tis not the many oaths, &amp;c.</Q>
As much as if &s;he had &s;aid, <HI>Ay, how indeed!&mdash;by a multi|plicity of vague and profane oaths: but what are the&s;e, when there is neither a moral po&s;&s;ibility of your performing your promi&s;e, nor would there be any moral rectitude in it if you did? For you cannot, in &s;uch ca&s;e, take a &s;ingle formal oath, and call the</HI> HIGHEST <HI>to witne&s;s the truth of your promi&s;e, without making a mock of his great attributes; viz. goodne&s;s and truth.</HI></P>
<P>What then becomes of Dr. John&s;on's fir&s;t alteration; his &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of dividing this &s;peech between Bertram and Diana; an alteration that would totally pervert the mean|ing of the pa&s;&s;age?</P>
<P>As to his latter alteration, though it be le&s;s exceptionable, it is equally unnece&s;&s;ary. For, taking the meaning of the words in the &s;en&s;e above-mentioned, the whole is perfectly intelligible and con&s;i&s;tent. <HI>If we take the High'&s;t to witne&s;s,</HI> &s;ays Diana, (which, it is already ob&s;erved, is done only when the intent of the oath is morally good) THEN, i. e. <HI>in that ea&s;e, pray tell me,</HI>
<Q>If <HI>I</HI> &s;hould &s;wear by Jove's great attributes,</Q>
i. e. goodne&s;s and truth,
<Q><PB N="125" REF="140">
<L>I <HI>LOV'D YOU</HI> dearly, would <HI>YOU</HI> believe <HI>MY</HI> oaths</L>
<L>When I did love you <HI>ILL</HI>?&mdash;</L></Q>
i. e. wickedly, immorally.
<Q><L>&mdash;This has no holding,</L>
<L>To &s;wear by <HI>HIM,</HI> whom <HI>I</HI> prote&s;t to <HI>LOVE,</HI></L>
<L>That I will work again&s;t him.</L></Q>
i. e. This is incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;wear by the God of truth and holine&s;s, whom I prote&s;t to love, that I will act di&s;hone&s;tly and wickedly. Nay, &s;hould we even admit with Dr. War|burton and the Revi&s;er, that
<Q>&mdash;This has no <HI>holding</HI></Q>
means that the oath can never <HI>hold</HI> or is not <HI>binding</HI>; this will make no difference with regard to the alteration propo&s;ed; the meaning of the lines, in that ca&s;e, being only &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Pandulph to King John:
<Q><L>It is religion that doth make vows kept,</L>
<L>But thou ha&s;t &s;worn again&s;t religion:</L>
<L>By what thou &s;wear'&s;t again&s;t the thing thou &s;wear'&s;t.</L></Q>
But it may be a&s;ked, why doth Diana prote&s;t that &s;he loves the &s;upreme Being by whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;es her&s;elf to &s;wear?&mdash;If we reflect, however, that this prote&s;tation is nothing more than that of her love to virtue, it is by no means improperly introduced to check Bertram's illicit pa&s;&s;ion, by depriving him of all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. For it is to be remarked, that though &s;he barely mention the ill con&s;equences to her&s;elf of being afterwards abandoned by Bertram, the point on which &s;he dwells upon mo&s;t, and &s;eems to lay the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s, is the immorality of the act. It may be added al&s;o, that, as Bertram hath not here made u&s;e of that very expre&s;&s;ion, in his vows to Diana, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he refers to &s;ome other conver&s;ation, in which he had not only &s;worn by love's own &s;weet con&s;traint, but al&s;o by <HI>her own &s;weet &s;elf,</HI> in which ca&s;e it is, with great propriety, &s;he introduces, by way of an|tithe&s;is, the prote&s;tation of her love to the God of truth and
<PB N="126" REF="141">
goodne&s;s, being oppo&s;ed to any love &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly entertain for him.&mdash;And this &s;uppo&s;ition is not ill-founded, if we re|flect on his calling her TITLED GODDESS, and his confe&s;&s;edly making u&s;e only of the oaths common to lovers.</P>
<Q><L>My mother told me ju&s;t how he would woo,</L>
<L>As if &s;he &s;ate in's heart; &s;he &s;ays all men</L>
<L>Have the like oaths.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>As to the alteration, &s;ugge&s;ted in our editor's appendix, and founded on the bad print of the old folio, I am of a different opinion to Dr. John&s;on, and think that, in&s;tead of making the difficulty le&s;s, it would make it much greater. I give my vote, therefore, for having the text &s;tand as it did, before either Dr. Warburton or Dr. John&s;on meddled with it;&mdash;except that the reader may, if he plea&s;es, add a comma after HIM;
<Q>To &s;wear by HIM, whom I prote&s;t to love.</Q></P>

<P>That is, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, throw him how you will, he lights on his legs.</P></Q>
<P>But why Parolles is like a cat, in re&s;pect to lighting upon his legs, I cannot, for the life of me, di&s;cover. Bertram had &s;aid, on the di&s;covery of Parolles to be a &s;coundrel, <HI>I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.</HI> On the expo&s;ition of his farther ba&s;ene&s;s, he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>he is more and more a cat</HI>; and at la&s;t, <HI>Pox on him, he's a cat &s;till.</HI> But, as Bertram gives no hint that he hates a cat for lighting upon her legs, I cannot conceive where Dr. John&s;on met with au|thority for his explanation.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o, that one of our editor's friends was as much at a lo&s;s as I am; I mean Mr. Steevens, who&s;e objection to this illu&s;tration is in&s;erted in the appendix.
<Q>Bertram, &s;ays Mr. Steevens, means no &s;uch thing. In a &s;peech or
<PB N="127" REF="142">
two before, he declares his aver&s;ion to a cat, and now only continues of the &s;ame opinion, and &s;ays, he hates Parolles as much as a cat. The other meaning will not do, as Parolles could not be meant by the cat, which lights always on its legs, for he is now in a fair way to be totally di&s;concerted.</Q></P>
<P>To this, however, Dr. John&s;on thinks proper to give no other an&s;wer than this;

<P>Dr. John&s;on is highly offended at the poet, for making the King &s;o ready to forgive his &s;on Bertram.
<Q>Shake&s;peare, &s;ays he, is now ha&s;tening to the end of the play, finds his matter &s;ufficient to fill up his remaining &s;cenes, and there|fore, as on other &s;uch occa&s;ions, contracts his dialogue, and precipitates his action. Decency required that Ber|tram's double crime of cruelty and di&s;obedience, joined like|wi&s;e with &s;ome hypocri&s;y, &s;hould rai&s;e more re&s;entment; and that, though his mother might ea&s;ily forgive him, his king &s;hould more pertinaciou&s;ly vindicate his own authority, and
<PB N="128" REF="143">
Helen's merit: of all this Shake&s;peare could not be igno|norant; but Shake&s;peare wanted to conclude his play.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not here undertake the defence of Shake&s;peare, as to the propriety of the King's readine&s;s to forgive Bertram, though I think it might ea&s;ily be done, if we reflect that the match propo&s;ed to the young prince was, in it&s;elf, very ab|&s;urd and prepo&s;terous. The King laid the foundation for, and provoked, the act of di&s;obedience in his &s;on, which was there|fore the more excu&s;able; for it will hardly be admitted, by any per&s;on in his right &s;en&s;es, that the paternal authority of the King ought to have carried him &s;o far as to degrade the heir apparent to his crown, by marrying him to the daugh|ter of a quack, merely becau&s;e &s;he had had the good luck, by one of her father's no&s;trums, to cure his maje&s;ty of a <HI>fi&s;tula in ano.</HI></P>
<P>This circum&s;tance con&s;idered al&s;o, I think it &s;hould have obtained &s;ome little favour for the character of Bertram in general, as well from our editor, as from the very ingenious authore&s;s of <HI>Shake&s;peare Illu&s;trated</HI>; for though he be on the whole a loo&s;e, unprincipled fellow, yet I think the ab&s;urdity and cruelty of this forced marriage affords a great palliation of his crimes.</P>
<P>But my rea&s;on for &s;topping at this pa&s;&s;age, is to remark another in&s;tance of our editor's readine&s;s to cen&s;ure Shake|&s;peare. Here, truly, Shake&s;peare hath done wrong in <HI>con|tracting his dialogue,</HI> becau&s;e he was in a hurry to fini&s;h his play: whereas, before the end of the play, Dr. John&s;on finds fault with him again for making his <HI>dialogue too long</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><Q><BIBL>Page 397.</BIBL> <HI>He knows him&s;elf,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;]</Q> This dialogue is too long, &s;ince the audience already knew the whole tran&s;action; nor is there any rea&s;on for puzzling the King, and playing with his pa&s;&s;ions; but <HI>it was much ea&s;ier</HI> than to make a pathetical inter|view between Helen and her hu&s;band, her mother, and the King.<BIBL>JOHNSON.</BIBL></Q>&mdash;When was Shake&s;peare ever accu&s;ed before of wilfully avoiding a proper opportunity of introducing pathetic &s;cenes, on account of the <HI>difficulty</HI> of the ta&s;k?</P></NOTE>.

<Q>Could one have thought it!</Q></P>
<P>Could one have thought it, indeed! A mighty pretty way this, of writing annotations on Shake&s;peare! To copy two long notes from Theobald and Warburton, and then to ex|claim, concerning &s;ome conundrum of the latter, <HI>Could one have thought it!</HI>&mdash;Neither your &s;ub&s;cribers, nor your book|&s;ellers, I believe, Dr. John&s;on, thought you would have fobbed them off &s;o &s;habbily. For, indeed, when a man pro|mi&s;ed &s;o fair, <HI>Could one have thought it?</HI>&mdash;But, perhaps, this is another &s;troke of our editor's WIT.&mdash;It is.&mdash;ha!&mdash;like enough&mdash;but, <HI>could one have thought it?</HI></P>
<P>We have in this play &s;everal other notes of &s;imilar impor|tance. Thus page 421, after a long note from Theobald, our editor adds,
<Q>Mr. Theobald had the art of making the
<PB N="130" REF="145">
mo&s;t of his di&s;coveries.</Q>
But this remark, however true it ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be in one &s;en&s;e, is far from being &s;o in another: for though Dr. John&s;on hath made very few di&s;coveries of his own, he hath di&s;covered the method of making more of Theobald's at &s;econd hand, than ever the author could do, when they were &s;pick and &s;pan new.</P>

<P>In this pa&s;&s;age our editor hath two notes from Theobald and Warburton; after which ne adopts the opinion of Mr. Edwards, who had expo&s;ed the ab&s;urdity of the latter, but without mentioning him, as u&s;ual.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over a word or two, which Dr. John&s;on hath dropt on this occa|&s;ion. <HI>A commentator,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>&s;hould be grave.</HI> But why, now, Doctor, &s;hould a commentator be <HI>grave?</HI> You &s;eem very angry, in your Preface, with Mr. Pope, for &s;uppo&s;ing that the ta&s;k of an editor mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>dull.</HI> Now, though there is &s;ome di&s;tinction of blood between dullne&s;s and gravity, they are near a-kin; and &s;o nearly alike in the <HI>face,</HI> that you might take them for &s;i&s;ters; ay, twins, with but half-an-hour's difference in their age. I dare &s;ay now that many of your mi&s;taken readers have frequently thought even you <HI>dull,</HI> when I warrant you the <HI>Doctor</HI> was only <HI>grave.</HI> I do not think, therefore, a commentator &s;hould wear &s;o much gravity. It is good to guard again&s;t mi&s;takes, as they are frequently better prevented than amended. Not that I hold it decent for a &s;cholia&s;t to be always upon the broad grin; but if the author him&s;elf be chearful, or the ab&s;urdities of a brother commentator &s;et him a laughing, where is the crime of indulging him&s;elf in it?&mdash;After this, let us hear no more of the <HI>gravity</HI> of a commentator <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to John&s;on's Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.</P>

<Q><L>&mdash;If the midnight bell</L>
<L>Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth</L>
<L>Sound ONE unto the drow&s;y race of night.</L></Q>
<P>The folio edition has it <HI>&s;ound</HI> ON; but our editor hath al|tered it either on the authority of Dr. Warburton, or his own, without giving any rea&s;on for &s;uch alteration. His friend Mr. Steevens, however, thinks the old reading right, and conceives the meaning to be this;
<Q><HI>if the midnight bell, by repeated &s;trokes, was to ha&s;ten away the race of beings that are bu&s;y at that hour, or quicken night in its progre&s;s,</HI> the morning bell (that is the bell that &s;trikes <HI>one</HI>) could never properly be made the agent, for the bell has cea&s;ed to be in the &s;ervice of night when it proclaims the arrival of day. <HI>Sound</HI> ON has a particular propriety, becau&s;e, by the repeti|tion of the &s;trokes at twelve, it gives a much more forcible warning than when it only &s;trikes <HI>one.</HI></Q>
&mdash;This critici&s;m is admitted by Dr. John&s;on into his appendix; but as he does not there retract his former judgment, we may &s;uppo&s;e he &s;till coincides with Dr. Warburton: or perhaps his own opi|nion is &s;u&s;pended between both. Mr. Steevens's note is in|genious enough indeed (as our editor expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on an|other occa&s;ion) to <HI>de&s;erve to be true</HI>; but if the &s;ingle autho|rity of the folio edition may be &s;et a&s;ide, I am afraid the double authority of two &s;uch learned and tremendous critics as Dr. John&s;on and the Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, will go likely to involve Shake&s;peare in the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing the clock &s;trikes but <HI>one</HI> to acquaint us of <HI>midnight.</HI> For that the la&s;t right reverend critic doth not think midnight merely a point of time, dividing night from morning, is evident from his comment on another pa&s;&s;age of Shake&s;peare's, in the Mid-&s;ummer Night's Dream, where, in&s;tead of <HI>the third part of a minute,</HI> he would have us read <HI>the third part of the midnight.</HI> Now points of time, as well as points of &s;pace, are unex|tended
<PB N="132" REF="147">
and indivi&s;ible; and yet the pre&s;ent editor makes no other objection to this propo&s;ed amendment, than that of &s;ilently rejecting it: but as this rejection is founded on other rea|&s;ons than the impropriety here mentioned, we may very rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that Dr. John&s;on, as well as Dr. Warburton, hath found out that midnight is a determinate quantity of du|ration, comprehending at lea&s;t all that &s;pace of time which elap&s;es between twelve at night and one in the morning! This admitted, it is no wonder that Mr. Steevens's note &s;hould appear exceptionable; for if <HI>he,</HI> on the &s;uppo&s;ition that when <HI>night</HI> is pa&s;t it mu&s;t be <HI>morning,</HI> can with propriety call the bell which &s;trikes <HI>twelve</HI> a midnight bell, <HI>they</HI> might with &s;till more propriety, on their &s;uppo&s;ition, call that a midnight bell which &s;trikes <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>My readers will probably think I have here &s;et the com|mentators together by the ears, only to perplex and confound both them and the poet.&mdash;Not at all.&mdash;The commentators were at odds before I meddled with them; and I have only brought them together, to &s;hew my own critical dexterity in reconciling them to each other, and extricating Shake&s;peare out of the hands of both.&mdash;For in&s;tance, now&mdash;To you, Mr. Steevens, I attribute the honour or having illu&s;trated the poet's meaning, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he wrote <HI>&s;trike</HI> ON: but, Sir, I &s;hall prove to your teeth, in &s;avour of your opponents, that <HI>their</HI> reading of the text may be right; and this even from your own argument. You &s;uppo&s;e that the bell, which &s;trikes <HI>one,</HI> is a morning bell&mdash;granted&mdash;it hath been &s;o a full hour; ever &s;ince the hand came to the point, and the clapper &s;truck the fir&s;t &s;troke of twelve. For you mu&s;t not conceive that Time &s;tands &s;tock-&s;till till the clock hath done &s;triking the whole dozen: and if it does not, the bell mu&s;t, according to you, be called a morning bell after the fir&s;t &s;troke; &s;o that we &s;ee there is even a phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility of a <HI>midnight</HI> bell's &s;triking more than ONE. What then be|comes of your repeated &s;trokes, and your midnight bell's
<PB N="133" REF="148">
&s;triking ON? <HI>Silence that dreadful bell, then, it di&s;turbs the</HI> text <HI>from its propriety.</HI>&mdash;EUGE, MAGNE.&mdash;Here was I going to congratulate my&s;elf on having topt all the commenta|tors, even in their <HI>own way,</HI> and on the wonderful acutene&s;s di&s;played in <HI>adju&s;ting</HI> this nice di&s;pute; but recollecting the fate of poor Theobald, and how &s;everely he hath been handled for boa&s;ting and <HI>making the mo&s;t</HI> of his di&s;coveries, I will wrap my&s;elf up in the buff doublet of my own &s;uffi|ciency, and leave the world to do ju&s;tice to merit, or let it alone, as it thinks proper.</P>
