<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now full &s;even months &s;ince the following curious Epi&s;tle was adverti&s;ed in the public papers, and its &s;peedy publication pro|mi&s;ed. We were then told al&s;o, that the occa&s;ion of it was a late infamous attack on the character of the Gentleman to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Morning Chronicle of July 25, 1772.</NOTE> The length of time which has &s;ince elap&s;ed, and that Gentleman's giving up his own cau&s;e, naturally gave room to ima|gine that the delivery of a mountain, &s;o long in labor with a mou&s;e, would be thought ridiculou&s;ly &s;uperfluous. The ingenious author, however, of <HI>"The Powers of the Pen&mdash;The Curate&mdash;Methodi&s;t and Conver&s;ation, Price Two and Sixpence each."</HI> could not re&s;i&s;t the powerful temptation of adding another <HI>two-&s;hilling</HI> &s;prig to his for|mer bays. Hence, after a truce declared, and the field of battle for|&s;aken, &s;teps forth this reverend champion, to renew the fight, and &s;lay the &s;lain. Unhappily for him, the di&s;turbance he has thus given their a&s;hes, &s;eems to have provoked their gho&s;ts to &s;eek an avenger in the per&s;on of that learned commentator Scriblerius Flagellarius; who makes no other apology for the <HI>in&s;ignificancy</HI> of his <HI>Comment,</HI> than the <HI>inanity</HI> of the <HI>Text;</HI> taking refuge under the old adage: <HI>Ex nihilo, nihil fit.</HI> Some apology, indeed, may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upperadding a copy of the Par&s;on's text whole and entire; and would be really &s;o, were it the property of the publi&s;her. But, as we find the original is printed on the author's own account, and he might &s;uffer more in his reputation, by our printing only mutilated extracts of his performance, than he would in his pocket from our printing the whole, we thought our&s;elves bound in ju&s;tice to pre|fer his fame, as an author, to his profit, as a book&s;eller. At the &s;ame time we held it incumbent on us, in ju&s;tice to the publick, to &s;et a le&s;s price on the Text and Comment together, than he has done on the Text alone: becau&s;e, admitting, as above, the inanity or no|thingne&s;s of both, we know, as adepts in Algebra, that negative quan|tities added together produce a &s;um &s;o much the le&s;s in <HI>value</HI> as the <HI>co-efficients</HI> encrea&s;e in <HI>number.</HI> Mode&s;ty, however, having in|duced us to value our Comment at but half the price of the Text, we have &s;tated the value of both together at a fourth le&s;s; agreeable to calculation; 
for &minus; 2 <HI>x</HI> added to &minus; <HI>x</HI> is &equals; to &minus; 3 <HI>x</HI> &equals; to eighteen-pence. Q. E. D</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT OF THE TEXT.</HEAD>
<P>As in the phy&s;ical or natural world the &s;un cheri&s;hes alike both weeds and flowers, &s;o in the world of letters the &s;un of learning &s;hines alike, both on the &s;cholar and the dunce, on the genius and the blockhead. [From the beginning to line 22.] Many and great are the evils which have fol|lowed this promi&s;cuous di&s;pen&s;ation of natural and literary ble&s;&s;ings. [l. 22 to 27.] According to the wi&s;dom of ages, and the laws of nature, it is a received maxim, that oppo&s;ites attract oppo&s;ites; as FAIRNES; <HI>Foulne&s;s,</HI> and &s;o forth. The depth of Heaven's de&s;ign in this is left to be &s;ounded by the metaphy&s;icians. [l. 27&mdash;36.] Facts alone are abided by, and the wa&s;ps, worms and flies, that prey upon our peaches and pears, are &s;hewn to be a natural evil, and a vile blunder in the &s;y&s;tem of Providence. [l. 36&mdash;38.] The world of <HI>letters</HI> is &s;till more <HI>prepo&s;terous</HI> than that of <HI>nature;</HI> dunces and blockheads con&s;tantly hunting down men of parts and genius. [l. 58 to 64.] Thus that old Grub and mini&s;terial pen&s;ioner, the author of the <HI>Fal&s;e Alarm</HI> [hight <HI>Dr. Sam. John&s;on</HI>] endeavoured to hunt down the well-known JUNIUS. [l. 64&mdash;100.] And thus mu&s;t thou, immortal <HI>Ro&s;cius,</HI> favoured by all the nine, expect to be hunted up and down. Nor can&s;t thou repine, while revelling in the embraces of the <HI>coy</HI> maids, at being
<PB N="2" REF="4">&s;ubject to the hi&s;&s;ing of the &s;nakes of Envy. [l. 100&mdash;134.] While Envy's fever burns, the raving bard, Bavius, with venomed heart, paints the vile&s;t crime, in vile&s;t words, in the vile&s;t rhime; [that is the author of <HI>Leap-Frog,</HI> hight &mdash; <HI>Shirley,</HI> E&s;q.] to&s;&s;es up St. Paul's, and &s;ets it top&s;y-turvey on its golden cro&s;s. It is thus he turns every thing ar&s;ey-ver&s;ey; even putting the all-&s;eeing eye of Heaven into the blind eye of a glow-worm's tail. It is thus he makes Bi&s;hop Lowth a blockhead&mdash;Dan Shake&s;peare unnatural&mdash;Orator Pitt a &s;tammerer, and thou, great Ro&s;cius, a toothe&s;s old oy&s;ter-woman! [l. 134&mdash;153.] Would&s;t thou be plea&s;ed that, when a future Plutarch [probably meaning Par&s;on W&mdash;s, author of as curious a pro&s;e Epi&s;tle to D. G. E&s;q.] &s;hall u&s;her thee into the temple of Fame, he &s;hould damn thy reputation, by placing Bavius [author of <HI>Leap-Frog</HI>] in the next niche, as thy friend? [l. 153&mdash;167.] And yet Candour will excu&s;e even <HI>Bavius,</HI> upon coolly reflecting on the pre&s;ent &s;trange top&s;ey-turvey &s;tate of nature; for, though formerly bulls butted with their horns, and a&s;&s;es kicked with their heels; man, bird and bea&s;t each following the dictates of nature; it is now quite otherwi&s;e; Bavius, the a&s;s, in&s;tead of lifting his heel, kicking us with his head. [l. 167&mdash;185.] Yet thou, immaculate Ro&s;cius, need'&s;t fear nothing, not even a legion of devils, with their Captain Satan, or their Lieutenant-Captain Mendax, at their head, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;cious innocence and the impenetrable &s;hield of VIRTUE. [l. 185&mdash;203.] Thou ha&s;t nothing to do but to li&s;ten to my <HI>numerous, melodious</HI> and <HI>nectareous</HI> ver&s;e; which flows to give Le|thaean re&s;t to that perturbed &s;pirit in thy brea&s;t; which, &s;ecured by virtue and innocence, does nothing but laugh and &s;ing; while guilt can never be lulled to re&s;t, though by a Welch harp, &s;trung with the harmonious locks of Apollo. [l. 203&mdash;227.] It is plea&s;ant to &s;ee repul&s;ed the feeble attacks of that Grub&s;treet-laureate, <HI>Zoilus,</HI> author of <HI>Love-in-the-Suds</HI> [hight Dr. <HI>Kenrick</HI>] monarch of Fleet-ditch, and U&s;urper of the throne of Cloacina; who&s;e cleanly revenues he receives, like another Roman Empe|ror, from the hands of &s;cavengers.

<P><PB N="3" REF="5">Line 20. The <HI>curio&s;a felicitas,</HI> or happy choice of words, and cha&s;tity of metaphor, for which our reverend author is &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed, begin already to manife&s;t them&s;elves.
<Q><L>So that bright &s;un, prime <HI>nouri&s;her</HI> of wit,</L>
<L>Which <HI>burns</HI> in Burke, in Lyttelton and Pitt.</L></Q> This is the fir&s;t time, we believe, that the <HI>flaming brightne&s;s</HI> or <HI>burning heat</HI> of the &s;un, has been mi&s;taken for that <HI>genial warmth</HI> by which it <HI>nou|ri&s;hes</HI> either fruits or flowers.</P>
<P>It is with peculiar propriety al&s;o that our reverend bard has particula|rized the great patriot Mr. Pitt, as one of tho&s;e on whom the <HI>&s;un of learning</HI> has &s;o beneficently &s;hone. The profundity of this great patriot's erudition, indeed, appears to &s;ingular advantage in his literary produc|tions; which, to u&s;e the ju&s;t di&s;tinction of Lord Pomfret, are writ|ten in the liberal &s;tyle of a <HI>gentleman,</HI> and not with that grammatic propriety which betrays the vulgar pen of a literary mechanick.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">Line 24. What a pity! To be &s;ure, it is a great evil that the &s;un &s;hines alike on the wi&s;e and the fooli&s;h; "on the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t." It is to be hoped the next time our wi&s;e Par&s;on gets into the pulpit, he will ex|punge this blunder from the &s;acred text, and correct &s;uch a gro&s;s error in the laws of nature.</P>
<P>Line 34. In what book of Proverbs, or by what law of nature, the bard has made this di&s;covery, we are at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s. Ari&s;totle in his Ethics tells us, <HI>Semper &s;imilem ducit deus ad &s;imilem;</HI> and again, to u&s;e his own words, <GAP DESC="foreign">. In the proverbial &s;ayings of all ages and countries, we &s;hall find al&s;o, that "<HI>like</HI> loves <HI>like.</HI>" "Birds of a feather flock together," &amp;c. <HI>Fairne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Foulne&s;s</HI> therefore are <HI>repul&s;ive</HI> and not <HI>attractive;</HI> things homogeneous only attract|ing each other; agreeably to the true &s;y&s;tem of the Newtonian philo&s;o|phy. The truth of the matter &s;eems to be this: the Par&s;on had &s;ome|where read
<Q><L>Envy will Merit as its &s;hade pur&s;ue.</L></Q>
But then the poet adds
<Q><L>It like a &s;hadow proves the &s;ub&s;tance true.</L></Q> Becau&s;e there can be no &s;hadow without a &s;ub&s;tance; but then our ingeni|ous <HI>Ma&s;ter of Arts</HI> forgot that the <HI>&s;hadow</HI> bears a re&s;emblance to the <HI>&s;ub|&s;tance</HI> and does not differ from it as <HI>foul</HI> doth from <HI>fair;</HI> as this divine poet, or rather <HI>poetical divine,</HI> has above &s;o roundly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">Line 42. What elegance of imagery do we find in this de&s;cription of Pomona, fruitful mother, Autumn's queen; repre&s;ented here, as &s;preading her vegetable petticoats, the vine or the fig-leaf, to pre&s;erve her mellow clu&s;ters, from the depredation of tho&s;e de&s;pe|rate banditti the wa&s;ps, whom he &s;atirizes &s;o wittily and &s;everely for their immoral and &s;candalous behaviour in being before-hand with him in the robbery of orchards.</P>
<P>Line 47. We &s;hould be glad to know, why our poet, on whom the <HI>&s;un of learning</HI> hath doubtle&s;s deigned to &s;hine, as well as on Burke, Lyt|telton and Pitt, hath here added the plural clo&s;e, common to Engli&s;h words, to that of <HI>Banditti,</HI> as if its ending in <HI>s</HI> were nece&s;&s;ary to make it plural. The &s;ingular of Banditti, in Engli&s;h, is <HI>Bandit,</HI> from the French, or <HI>Banditto,</HI> from the Italian. Thus Milton.
<Q><L>No &s;avage fierce <HI>Bandit,</HI> or mountaineer.</L></Q>
And Shake&s;peare,
<Q><L>A Roman &s;worder, and <HI>Banditto</HI> &s;lave.</L></Q> But perhaps our learned Ma&s;ter of Arts might, by <HI>Banditties,</HI> mean a num|ber of different companies, or ruffian bands of Banditti: but a band and a Bandit are different words. The author's ignorance, therefore, is obvious; the word <HI>Banditti</HI> being never u&s;ed as a noun of multitude in the &s;ingular number, and therefore cannot be made plural, like <HI>band,</HI> or other Engli&s;h words, by the u&s;ual termination in <HI>s.</HI> What a pretty Ma&s;ter of Arts! Really, friend Evan, you &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;chool again, to con your accidence.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">Line 48. For "Wa&s;ps, who <HI>&s;ing"</HI>&mdash;we &s;hould certainly read "Wa&s;ps who <HI>&s;ting.</HI> "&mdash;Of <HI>&s;tinging</HI> wa&s;ps we have heard: but of <HI>&s;inging</HI> wa&s;ps never. This we &s;hould have thought an errour of the pre&s;s, but for the rea&s;on a&s;|&s;igned in the next note.</P>
<P>Line 50. Our author &s;eems to entertain a violent re&s;entment, if not a rooted antipathy, again&s;t the whole <HI>ferae naturae.</HI> We &s;hould, however be glad to know by whom, according to his &s;y&s;tem of religion and morals, they were laid under any moral obligation, and to whom they are ac|countable.
<Q><L>The downy peach, the bloom-&s;uffu&s;ed plumb,</L></Q>
that <HI>bloom-&s;uffu&s;ed</HI> is a happy epithet!
<Q><L>Proclaim their wrongs with bleeding mouths, tho' dumb.</L></Q> From a dumb mouth mu&s;t certainly proceed a &s;ilent proclamation; which mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, al&s;o, be ju&s;t as curious as intelligible. Our poet &s;eems, indeed, here to be as good a naturali&s;t as he is a morali&s;t and divine: but as we, <HI>Scriblerius Vapularius,</HI> are &s;trangers to the phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ation and moral &s;entiment of vegetables, we are at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at his meaning, either re|ligious, philo&s;ophical, or moral.</P>
<P>Line 60. What a happy di&s;covery, and how worthy a prote&s;tant divine, that the &s;y&s;tem of Providence is a <HI>prepo&s;terous</HI> &s;y&s;tem! It is no wonder,
<PB N="7" REF="9">if he found &s;uch ab&s;urdity prevail in the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>nature,</HI> that he &s;hould find more in a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>art.</HI></P>
<P>Line 62. This crime of <HI>being bright</HI> is certainly a very capital one, though it is not likely our author will ever be found guilty of it.</P>
<P>Line 64. By this rhyme of <HI>offence</HI> and <HI>defence,</HI> it &s;eems as if our poet had entered into a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t Engli&s;h ver&s;ifica|tion.</P>
<P>Line 68. We have heard of book-worms, natural and metaphorical, but they are &s;uch as <HI>devour</HI> books, in&s;tead of reading them. As to a <HI>&s;pel|ling</HI> worm, we never heard of &s;uch a reptile either in the natural or lite|rary &s;y&s;tem. Our author's &s;pelling worm appears al&s;o to be, at the &s;ame time, a mere garden grub, who cankers the laurels of the poet, while he is &s;pelling his ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Line 72. The chief grub having, undergone its metamorpho&s;is, is now become a caterpillar. We find, however, that his transformation is but partial; he being &s;till famed for <HI>long words</HI> and <HI>pedantry.</HI> This is the fir&s;t time we have known a <HI>caterpillar</HI> reproached with the u&s;e of the <HI>&s;e&s;quiped&agrave;lia.</HI> Had our poet called Dr. John&s;on, the per&s;on here alluded to, a caterpillar or grub-worm <HI>critic,</HI> the metaphor would have been pre|&s;erved: but he cannot be at once a human hog and a hog-hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">Line 76. The&s;e thou&s;and feet would be applicable enough to the critic, con&s;idered as a <HI>millepedes,</HI> or wood-lou&s;e, in&s;tead of a worm, or caterpillar; though it be whim&s;ical to think an in&s;ect &s;hould carry &s;purs on its feet, to goad it&s;elf. As the text &s;tands, however, our Ma&s;ter of Arts &s;eems &s;o learned a naturali&s;t, as not to know a grub from an earwig.</P>
<P>Line 85. We &s;hall leave the Doctors Cadogan, Hill, and Ingram, to decide whether &s;nails can be afflicted with the gout or not; and if not to &s;ome future critic to di&s;cu&s;s the propriety of this epithet. But we, mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve that, for want of grammatical con&s;truction, in the&s;e two lines,
<Q><L>Onward he crawleth, like a gouty &s;nail,</L>
<L>Cowards to fight, or felons to a jail,</L></Q> The la&s;t is downright non&s;en&s;e; unle&s;s the poet meant to make &s;en&s;e of half of it, by &s;aying he crawleth to fight cowards; for which, by the way, he does not &s;eem to have occa&s;ion for a thou&s;and feet.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">Line 95. We never heard that the Apo&s;tle, or any Saint of the name of <HI>James;</HI> kept his court, or was &s;urrounded with a brilliant cir|cle at his levee. Our poetical par&s;on mu&s;t certainly mean, therefore, the brilliant circle in the drawing-room or pre&s;ence-chamber, at <HI>St. James's;</HI> &s;o that the above lines, in&s;tead of running as above, &s;hould be corrected, and &s;tand as under,
<Q><L>When in the brilliant circle of St. James's</L>
<L>Amelia's beauties &s;et the court in <HI>flames's.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Line 100. Query, Doth the poet mean that Nature hath given but|terflies power only to &s;tain their mealy wings? or to &s;tain any thing el&s;e <HI>with,</HI> or by means of, their mealy wings? If the former, he has written non&s;en&s;e; if the latter, fal&s;e grammar.</P>
<P>Line 106. The mu&s;es cla&s;ping the genius of Ro&s;cius, and his &s;hining Parna&s;&s;us' pride without a wa&s;p, is &s;omething beautifully metaphorical, if it were but intelligible. It is pity that <HI>cla&s;p</HI> and <HI>wa&s;p</HI> are not the be&s;t of rhimes. <HI>Ra&s;p</HI> or <HI>ha&s;p</HI> would have mended the <HI>&s;ound</HI> and could not have marred the <HI>&s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">Line 112. This revelling in the &s;avour of the nine, mu&s;t be attended al&s;o with a &s;ingular kind of beatitude; e&s;pecially if the maids are &s;till &s;o coy as to confine their &s;avours to a &s;imple ki&s;s. And yet this, perhaps, is as much as he ought to wi&s;h for; &s;ince, though he might po&s;&s;ibly be able to deflower, he could never &s;atisfactorily enjoy them.</P>
<P>Line 115, Of Ro&s;cius's &s;wimming on a &s;ea of glory, one may form &s;ome idea, by &s;eeing the buoy at the Nore ride over the waves, at all times of the tide; or to adapt more properly my &s;imile to the &s;ub|ject, by &s;eeing the float of a fi&s;hing-line dance upon the &s;urface of the water, till &s;ome gudgeon bite at the hook. But what is to be under&s;tood by the tides of plea&s;ure drowning the brim of the &s;ea of glory, we mu&s;t leave to the &s;agacity of happier &s;cholia&s;ts.</P>
<P>Line 119. We have frequently heard that <HI>lo&s;ers</HI> have leave to rail; but why the lo&s;er is to be called a <HI>wretch,</HI> becau&s;e the winner is a <HI>ra&s;cal,</HI> we do not comprehend. But perhaps the good Ro&s;cius can inform us why the author of Edward the <HI>Black Prince</HI> has rea&s;on to rail. Did that con&s;cientious manager ever pick his pocket of five hundred pounds, in the &s;ame infamous manner as he did that of the author of <HI>Fal&s;taff's Wedding?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">Line 129. It would indeed be a wi&s;er way than to run to hireling pleaders and pettifogging attorneys, to avenge his cau&s;e, by proceedings little better than the &s;ubornation of perjury.</P>
<P>Line 135. The raving bard here pointed at, &s;eems to be the author of a &s;candalous copy of ver&s;es, entitled <HI>Leap-Frog,</HI> de&s;criptive of that dirty game, publi&s;hed in the Public Ledger; the rhimes of which were certainly bad enough, and wor&s;e than any we have ever &s;een, except tho&s;e of our au|thor.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">Line 153. The&s;e are admirable lines and the compari&s;on of Ro&s;cius to an oy&s;ter-woman, very applicable to the critici&s;ms on that great actor's playing, publi&s;hed in the Gazeteer, before it became a vehicle to the puffs of the manager. The pro&s;opopeia or per&s;onification of &s;uch cen&s;ures is al&s;o very beautiful: it might have been mended, however, had the poet repre&s;ented them as wa&s;ps, gnats, or hornets; unle&s;s by moths he meant to allude to their picking holes in the manager's coat.</P>

<P>Line 171. This di&s;tinction between <HI>ill-blood</HI> ond <HI>ill-will</HI> is another in|&s;tance of our author's wonderful di&s;coveries in phy&s;icks and morality; or rather of his dexterous u&s;e of that rhetorical trope, the metaphor. That
<PB N="13" REF="15">bad <HI>blood</HI> &s;hould produce a &s;trangury of <HI>wit,</HI> is a circum&s;tance, we believe, only known to our author; unle&s;s by <HI>wit</HI> he means <HI>humour,</HI> and thinks all kinds of humour alike; in which ca&s;e, to be &s;ure, a cachectic habit, ari&s;ing from the abu&s;e of the non-naturals, may preduce a &s;trangury of wit; with which ma&s;ter Evan, if he ever had any wit, &s;eems to be unhappily affected. <HI>Facit indignatio ver&s;us</HI> is an old adage, and &s;eems applicable to the ha&s;ty and turbulent ebullitions of <HI>ill blood.</HI> Our author's appear to be the effect of <HI>ill-will;</HI> cold blooded ver&s;es, that have neither the heat of anger, for their excu&s;e on the one hand, nor the warmth of <HI>good-will,</HI> to recommend them on the other.</P>

<P>Line 225. This idea of a Welch harp being &s;trung with the carrotty locks of Apollo, is apparently too a borrowed thought; for who does not &s;ee that this device of Apollo's harmony lying in his hair, was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by Samp&s;on's &s;trength lying in tho&s;e curling locks; of which Dalilah &s;o perfidiou&s;ly deprived him?

Should we recur, however, to the news-paper altercation it gave ri&s;e to, we &s;hall find the Monarch of Drury-lane, even then, more deeply intrenched on his throne of mud, than his antagoni&s;t, the Monarch of Fleet-ditch.</P>

<P>It is, on the whole, peculiarly mode&s;t in our Welch Par&s;on, to reproach the author of Love-in-the-Suds for being a <HI>libeller;</HI> when he him&s;elf was not long &s;ince convicted in the court of King's-bench, and committed to the pri&s;on of that court, accordingly, for writing a libel; a libel too of the mo&s;t uncharitable and infamous kind, in a man of his &s;acred function; being levelled at his neighbour, for exerci&s;ing liberty of con&s;cience in matters of religion and morality.
