<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE want of a proper &s;et of exerci&s;es, ap|plied to the different branches of mathematical knowledge, which are deemed requi&s;ite to the military profe&s;&s;ion, induced me to draw up the following &s;heets. Their utility to the &s;tudents in the Royal Military Academy, having been fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, recommended them to the con&s;ider|ation of the Ma&s;ter General; and His Grace has been plea&s;ed to order them to be printed.</P>
<P>The mi&s;cellaneous form of this &s;mall work, ari&s;es from its con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of practical que&s;|tions in mo&s;t of the &s;ciences now taught in the Academy. Although Invention was not my im|mediate object, yet throughout the whole there will be found many things that are new, in
<PB N="viii" REF="6">point of matter, but more &s;o in the manner of treating the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the Conic Sections there are &s;everal new and important properties di&s;per&s;ed through the books; and it is pre&s;umed that this branch is treated in a way better adapted to its intended u&s;e, than heretofore. The propo&s;itions, although demon&s;trated in a manner &s;trictly geometrical, have this peculiarity, that only the fir&s;t pro|perty of each &s;ection is demon&s;trated from the cone it&s;elf, and all the &s;ub&s;equent ones derived from the fir&s;t, or from each other, in an ea&s;y and natural way, without introducing any arbitrary organical de&s;cription of curves in plano. The arrangement of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eps in &s;eparate lines is al&s;o found to be an advantage, as it renders the demon&s;trations more ea&s;y to be comprehended, by pre&s;enting the whole to the eye in one con|nected view. And another very con&s;iderable im|provement ari&s;es from the application of a new and general property concerning the inter|&s;ections of a right line, with any of the curves, in two points: by means of which the general properties of the oblique ordinates, to any dia|meter, are ea&s;ily deduced, without the forced and perplexed con&s;ideration of the areas of cer|tain &s;paces.</P>
<P>The &s;everal propo&s;itions and properties, in the three curves or &s;ections, are al&s;o arranged in &s;uch
<PB N="ix" REF="7">order, and enunciated in &s;uch manner, as to &s;hew which properties are common to the different &s;ections; and in particular it will be found, that mo&s;t of the definitions and &s;cholia are common to all the three curves; and that all the pro|po&s;itions and demon&s;trations of the ellip&s;e, are literally the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the hyperbola: a circum&s;tance which mu&s;t render both the learning and the remembering of the properties much ea&s;ier than heretofore.</P>
<P>The collection of practical que&s;tions, which follow the Conic Sections, are mo&s;tly given without &s;olutions, their an&s;wers only being &s;et down, as probationary exerci&s;es to certain rules and branches of &s;cience contained in mo&s;t books relating to the&s;e &s;ubjects. But the la&s;t collection, concerning forces, and the accompanying cir|cum&s;tances of time, &s;pace, and the velocity ge|nerated, have &s;olutions annexed to them; as they require a knowledge of &s;ome other principles be|&s;ides tho&s;e that are u&s;ually found in the common books of &s;cience. Many of the problems in this part may, indeed, be met with el&s;ewhere; but it is pre&s;umed, that the &s;olutions will be found in general, either new, or attended with con&s;iderable improvement.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty al&s;o to enrich this part with &s;ome new and u&s;eful problems relating
<PB N="x" REF="8">to the times of filling and emptying the ditches of fortifications, or other receptacles, with water, entering and evacuating them under certain cir|cum&s;tances. The&s;e curious problems, His Grace the Ma&s;ter General of the Ordnance was plea&s;ed to propo&s;e at a late examination of the Gen|tlemen Cadets; and the &s;olutions at large, of &s;uch important propo&s;itions, are here publi&s;hed, as far as I know, for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ucceeds the common theory of the motion of bodies in re&s;i&s;ting mediums, but de|livered in a manner, I tru&s;t, better adapted to practical purpo&s;es than in any former publi|cation.</P>
<P>The volume then concludes with a com|pendium of &s;ome experiments, lately made to a&s;certain the actual re&s;i&s;tance of the air to given &s;urfaces, moving through it with given velocities, and different degrees of inclination: experiments, which it is to be wi&s;hed may be farther pro&s;ecuted, as it is by &s;uch means only that the true theory of military projectiles, as well as other branches of natural philo&s;ophy, can be improved to any degree of practical utility.</P>

<HEAD>DEFINITIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CONIC &s;ections are the figures made by the mu|tual inter&s;ection of a cone and a plane.</P>
<P N="2">2. According to the different po&s;itions of the cutting plane, there ari&s;e five different figures or &s;ections, namely, a triangle, a circle, an ellip&s;e, a parabola, and an hyperbola: the three la&s;t of which only are peculiarly called conic &s;ections.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the cutting plane pa&s;s through the vertex of the cone, and any part of the ba&s;e, the &s;ection will evidently be a triangle; as VAB.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="4">4. If the plane cut the cone parallel to the ba&s;e, or make no angle with it, the &s;ection will be a circle; as ABD.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="2" REF="11">5. The &s;ection DAB is an ellip&s;e, when the cone is cut obliquely through both &s;ides, or when the plane is in|clined to the ba&s;e in a le&s;s angle than the &s;ide of the cone is.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ection is a parabola, when the cone is cut by a plane parallel to the ba&s;e, or when the cutting plane and the &s;ide of the cone make equal angles with the ba&s;e.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;ection is an hyperbola, when the cutting plane makes a greater angle with the ba&s;e than the &s;ide of the cone makes.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P N="8">8. And if all the &s;ides of the cone be continued through the vertex, forming an oppo&s;ite equal cone, and the plane be al&s;o continued to cut the oppo&s;ite cone, this latter &s;ection will be the oppo&s;ite hyper|bola to the former; as dBe.</P>
<P N="9">9. The vertices of any &s;ection, are the points where the cutting plane meets the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the cone, or the &s;ides of the vertical triangular &s;ection; as A and B.</P>
<P>Hence the ellip&s;e and the oppo&s;ite hyperbolas, have each two vertices; but the parabola only one; unle&s;s we con|&s;ider the other as at an infinite di&s;tance.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Axis, or Tran&s;ver&s;e Diameter, of a conic &s;ection, is the line or di&s;tance AB between the vertices.</P>
<P>Hence the axis of a parabola is infinite in length, Ab being only a part of it.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P N="11">11. The Center C is the middle of the axis.</P>
<P>Hence the center of a parabola is infinitely di&s;tant from the vertex. And of an ellip&s;e the axis and center lie within the curve; but of an hyperbola without.</P>
<P N="12">12. A Diameter is any right line, as AB or DE, drawn through the center, and terminated on each &s;ide by the curve; and the extremities of the diameter, or its inter|&s;ections with the curve, are its vertices.</P>
<P>Hence all the diameters of a parabola are parallel to the axis, and infinite in length. And hence al&s;o every diame|ter of the ellip&s;e and hyperbola have two vertices; but of the parabola only one; unle&s;s we con&s;ider the other as at an infinite di&s;tance.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Conjugate to any diameter, is the line drawn through the center, and parallel to the tangent of the curve at the vertex of the diameter. So FG, parallel to the tan|gent at D, is the conjugate to DE; and HI, parallel to the tangent at A, is the conjugate to AB.</P>
<P>Hence the conjugate HI, of the axis AB, is perpendi|cular to it.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P N="14">14. An Ordinate to any diameter, is a line parallel to its conjugate, or to the tangent at its vertex, and termi|nated by the diameter and curve. So DK, EL are ordi|nates to the axis AB; and MN, NO ordinates to the diame|ter DE.</P>
<P>Hence the ordinates to the axis are perpendicular to it.</P>
<P N="15">15. An Ab&s;ci&s;s is a part of any diameter contained be|tween its vertex and an ordinate to it; as AK or BK, or DN or EN.</P>
<P>Hence, in the ellip&s;e and hyperbola, every ordinate has two ab&s;ci&s;&s;es; but in the parabola, only one; the other vertex of the diameter being infinitely di&s;tant.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Parameter of any diameter, is a third pro|portional to that diameter and its conjugate.</P>
<P N="17">17. The Focus is the point in the axis where the ordi|nate is equal to half the parameter. As K and L, where DK or EL is equal to the &s;emi-parameter.</P>
<P>Hence, the ellip&s;e and hyperbola have each two foci; but the parabola only one.</P>
<P N="18">18. If DAE, FBG be two oppo&s;ite hyperbolas having AB for their fir&s;t or tran&s;ver&s;e axis, and ab for their &s;econd or
<PB N="5" REF="14">
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> conjugate axis. And if dae, fbg be two other oppo&s;ite hyperbolas having the &s;ame axes, but in the contrary order, namely, ab their fir&s;t axis, and AB their &s;econd; then the&s;e two latter curves dae, fbg, are called the con|jugate hyperbolas to the two former DAE, FBG; and each pair of oppo&s;ite curves mutually conjugate to the other.</P>
<P N="19">19. And if tangents be drawn to the four vertices of the curves, or extremities of the axes, forming the in|&s;cribed rectangle HIKL; the diagonals HCK, ICL of this rectangle, are called the a&s;ymptotes of the curves.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="scholium">
<HEAD>SCHOLIUM.</HEAD>
<P>The rectangle in&s;cribed between the four conjugate hyperbolas, is &s;imilar to a rectangle circum&s;cribed about an ellip&s;e by drawing tangents, in like manner, to the four extremities of the two axes; and the a&s;ymptotes or diagonals in the hyperbola, are analogous to tho&s;e in the ellip&s;e, cutting this curve in &s;imilar points, and making the pair of equal conjugate diameters. Moreover, the whole figure, formed by the four hyperbolas, is, as it were, an ellip&s;e turned in&s;ide out, cut open at the ex|tremities D, E, F, G, of the &s;aid equal conjugate diameters, and tho&s;e four points drawn out to an infinite di&s;tance, the curvature being turned the contrary way, but the axes, and the rectangle pa&s;&s;ing through their extremities, continuing fixed.</P>

<P>In the ellip&s;e, the &s;emi-conjugate axis, CD or CE, is a mean proportional between CO and CP, the parts of the diameter OP of a circle drawn through the center C of the ellip&s;e, and parallel to the ba&s;e of the cone. For DE is a double ordinate in this circle, being perpendicular to OP as well as to AB.</P>
<P>In like manner, in the hyperbola, the length of the &s;emi-conjugate axis, CD or CE, is a mean proportional between CO and CP, drawn parallel to the ba&s;e, and meet|ing the &s;ides of the cone in O and P. Or, if AO&prime; be drawn parallel to the &s;ide VB, and meet PC produced in O&prime;, making CO&prime; &equals; CO; and on this diameter O&prime;P a circle be drawn parallel to the ba&s;e: then the &s;emi-conjugate CD or CE will be an ordinate of this circle, being perpendi|cular to O&prime;P as well as to AB.</P>
<P>Or, in both figures, the whole conjugate axis DE is a mean proportional between QA and BR, parallel to the ba&s;e of the cone. For, becau&s;e AB is double of AC or CB, therefore, by &s;imilar triangles, QA is double of OC, and BR double of CP; con&s;equently</P>
<P>DE^2 or 2C &middot; 2E, or 2CO &middot; 2CP is &equals; QA &middot; BR, or QA &ratio; DE &proportion; DE &ratio; BR.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">In the parabola both the tran&s;ver&s;e and conjugate are infinite; for AB and BR are both infinite.</P>
<P>COROL. 2. In all the &s;ections AG will be equal to the parameter of the axis, if QG be drawn making the angle AQG equal to the angle BAR.</P>
<P>For, by the definition, AB &ratio; DE &proportion; DE &ratio; <HI>p</HI> the param. But by corol. 1, BR &ratio; DE &proportion; DE &ratio; AQ; Therefore AB &ratio; BR &proportion; AQ &ratio; <HI>p.</HI> But, by &s;imilar triangles, AB &ratio; BR &proportion; AQ &ratio; AG; And therefore AG &equals; <HI>p</HI> the parameter.</P>
<P>In like manner Bg will be equal to the parameter <HI>p,</HI> if Rg be drawn to make the angle BRg &equals; the angle ABQ; &s;ince here al&s;o AB &ratio; AQ &proportion; BR &ratio; BG &equals; <HI>p.</HI></P>
<P>COROL. 3. Hence the upper hyperbolic &s;ection, or &s;ection of the oppo&s;ite cone, is equal and &s;imilar to the lower &s;ection. For the two &s;ections have the &s;ame tran&s;ver&s;e or fir&s;t axis AB, and the &s;ame conjugate or &s;econd axis DE, which is the mean proportional between AQ and RB; they have al&s;o equal parameters AG, Bg. So that the two oppo&s;ite &s;ections make, as it were, but the two oppo&s;ite ends of one entire &s;ection or hyperbola, the two being every where mutually equal and &s;imilar. Like the two halves of an ellip&s;e, with their ends turned the contrary way.</P>
<P>COROL. 4. And hence, although both the tran&s;ver&s;e and conjugate axis in the parabola be infinite, yet the former is infinitely greater than the latter, or has an infinite ratio to it. For the tran&s;ver&s;e has the &s;ame ratio to the conjugate, as the conjugate has to the parameter, that is, as an infinite to a finite quantity, which is an infinite ratio.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P>The Squares of the Ordinates of the Axis are to each other as the Rectangles of their Ab&s;ci&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Let AVB be a plane pa&s;&s;ing through the axis of the cone; AGIH another &s;ection of the cone perpendicular to the plane of the former; AB the axis of this elliptic &s;ection; and FG, HI ordinates perpendicular to it. Then I &s;ay that FG^2 &ratio; HI^2 &proportion; AF&middot;FB &ratio; AH&middot;HB.</P>

<P>For, through the ordinates FG, HI draw the circular &s;ections KGL, MIN parallel to the ba&s;e of the cone, having KL, MN for their diameters, to which FG, HI are ordinates, as well as to the axis of the ellip&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, by the &s;imilar triangles AFL, AHN, and BFL, BHM, we have AF &ratio; AH &proportion; FL &ratio; HN, and FB &ratio; HB &proportion; KF &ratio; MH; hence, taking the rectangles of the corre&s;ponding terms, we have the rect. AF&middot;FB &ratio; AH&middot;HB &proportion; KF&middot;FL &ratio; MH&middot;HN. But, by the nature of the circle, KF&middot;FL &equals; FG^2, and MH&middot;HN &equals; HI^2; Therefore the rect. AF&middot;FB &ratio; AH&middot;HB &proportion; FG^2 &ratio; HI^2. Q.E.D.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18">COROL. 1. All the parallel &s;ections are &s;imilar figures, or have their two axes in the &s;ame proportion; that is, AB &ratio; ab &proportion; DE &ratio; de.</P>

<P>COROL. 2. Hence al&s;o, as the property is the &s;ame for the ordinates on both &s;ides of the diameter, it follows, that</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. At equal di&s;tances from the center, or from the vertices, the ordinates on both &s;ides are equal, or that the double ordinates are bi&s;ected by the axis; and that the whole figure, made up of all the double ordinates, is al&s;o bi&s;ected by the axis.</P>

That is, the rectangle of every two conjugate diameters, drawn into the &s;ine of their contained angle, is equal to the &s;ame con&s;tant quantity.

<P>IRON balls and &s;hells are commonly piled, by horizontal cour&s;es, either in a pyramidical or wedge-like form; the ba&s;e being either an equilateral triangle, a &s;quare, or a rectangle. In the triangle and &s;quare, the pile will fini&s;h in a &s;ingle ball; but in the rectangle, it will fini&s;h in a &s;ingle row of balls, like an edge.</P>
<P>In triangular and &s;quare piles, the number of horizontal rows, or cour&s;es, is always equal to the number of balls in one &s;ide of the bottom row. And in rectangular piles, the number of rows is equal to the number of balls in the breadth of the bottom row. Al&s;o in the number in the top row, or edge, is one more than the difference between the length and breadth of the bottom row.</P>

<HEAD>PROBLEM XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>To determine the Force of Fluids in Motion. And the Circum&s;tances attending Bodies moving in Fluids.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is evident that the re&s;i&s;tance to a plane, moving perpendicularly through an infinite fluid, at re&s;t, is equal to the pre&s;&s;ure or force of the fluid upon the plane at re&s;t, and the fluid moving with the &s;ame velocity, and in the contrary direction, to that of the plane in the former ca&s;e. But the force of the fluid in motion, mu&s;t be equal to the weight or pre&s;&s;ure which generates that motion; and which, it is known, is equal to the weight or pre&s;&s;ure of a column of the fluid, who&s;e ba&s;e is equal to the plane, and its altitude equal to the height through which a body mu&s;t fall, by the force of gravity, to acquire the ve|locity of the fluid: and that altitude is, for the &s;ake of brevity, called the altitude due to the velocity. So that, if <HI>a</HI> denote the area of the plane, <HI>v</HI> the velocity, and <HI>n</HI> the &s;pecific gravity of the fluid; then, the altitude due to the velocity <HI>v</HI> being <HI>v</HI>^2/4<HI>g,</HI> the whole re&s;i&s;tance, or mo|tive force <HI>m,</HI> will be <HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>n</HI> &times; <HI>v</HI>^2/4<HI>g</HI> &equals; <HI>anv</HI>^2/4<HI>g</HI>; <HI>g</HI> being 16 1/12 feet. And hence, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the re&s;i&s;tance is as the &s;quare of the velocity.</P>
<P N="2">2. This ratio, of the &s;quare of the velocity, may be otherwi&s;e derived thus. The force of the fluid in mo|tion, mu&s;t be as the force of one particle multiplied by
<PB N="222" REF="231">the number of them: but the force of a particle is as its velocity; and the number that &s;trikes the plane in a given time, is al&s;o as the velocity; therefore the whole force is as <HI>v</HI> &times; <HI>v</HI> or <HI>v</HI>^2, that is, as the &s;quare of the velocity.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the direction of motion, in&s;tead of being perpen|dicular to the plane, as above &s;uppo&s;ed, were inclined to it in any angle, the &s;ine of that angle being <HI>s,</HI> to the radius 1; then the re&s;i&s;tance to the plane, or the force of the fluid again&s;t the plane, in the direction of the motion, as a&s;&s;igned above, will be dimini&s;hed in the triplicate ratio of radius to the &s;ine of the angle of in|clination, or in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s</HI>^3. For, AB being the direction of the plane, and BD that of the motion, making the angle ABD, who&s;e &s;ine is <HI>s;</HI> the num|ber of particles, or quantity of the fluid, &s;triking the plane, will be dimini&s;hed in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s,</HI> or of radius to the &s;ine of the angle B of inclination; and the force of each particle will al&s;o be dimini&s;hed in the &s;ame ratio of 1 to <HI>s;</HI> &s;o that, on both the&s;e accounts, the whole re&s;i&s;tance will be dimini&s;hed in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s</HI>^2, or in the duplicate ratio of radius to the &s;ine of the &s;aid angle. But again, it is to be con&s;idered that this whole re&s;i&s;tance is exerted in the direction BE perpendicular to the plane; and any force in the direction BE, is to its effect in the direction AE, parallel to BD, as AE to BF, that is as 1 to <HI>s.</HI> So that finally, on all the&s;e accounts, the re&s;i&s;tance in the direction of motion, is dimini&s;hed in the ratio of 1 to <HI>s</HI>^3, or in the triplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination. Hence, comparing this with article 1, the whole re|&s;i&s;tance, or the motive force on the plane, will be <HI>m</HI> &equals; <HI>anv</HI>^2<HI>s</HI>^3/4<HI>g.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4.

And if the den&s;ity of the fluid were equal to that of the globe, the re&s;i&s;ting force is &s;uch, as, acting con&s;tantly on the globe without any other force, would generate or de&s;troy its motion in de&s;cribing the &s;pace 4/3<HI>d,</HI> by that accelerating or retarding force.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence the greate&s;t velocity that a globe will ac|quire by de&s;cending in a fluid, by means of its relative weight in the fluid, will be found by making the re&s;i&s;t|ing

Now, N and <HI>n</HI> being the &s;eparate &s;pecific gravities of the globe and fluid, N &minus; <HI>n</HI> will be the relative gravity of the globe in the fluid, and therefore <HI>w</HI> &equals; &frac16; <HI>pd</HI>^3 (N &minus; <HI>n</HI>) the weight by which it is urged; al&s;o <HI>m</HI> &equals; <HI>pnv</HI>^2<HI>d</HI>^2/32<HI>g</HI> is the re&s;i&s;tance; con&s;equently <HI>pnv</HI>^2<HI>d</HI>^2/32<HI>g</HI> &equals; 1/6 <HI>pd</HI>^3 (N &minus; <HI>n</HI>) when the velocity becomes uniform; from which is found <GAP DESC="math"> for the &s;aid uniform or greate&s;t velocity.</P>
<P>And by comparing this form with that in art. 6 of the general theorems in page 169, it will appear that its greate&s;t velocity is equal to the velocity generated by the accelerating force <GAP DESC="math"> in de&s;cribing the &s;pace 4/3 <HI>d,</HI> or equal to the velocity generated by gravity in freely de|&s;cribing the &s;pace <GAP DESC="math">, or the &s;pecific gravity of the globe be double that of the fluid, then <GAP DESC="math"> &equals; 1 &equals; the natural force of gravity; and then the globe will attain its greate&s;t velocity in de|&s;cribing 4/3 <HI>d,</HI> or 4/3 of its diameter.&mdash;It is farther evi|dent that if the body be very &s;mall, it will very &s;oon acquire its greate&s;t velocity, whatever its den&s;ity may be.</P>
<P>Ex. If a leaden ball, of 1 inch diameter, de&s;cend in water, and in air of the &s;ame den&s;ity as at the earth's &s;ur|face, the three &s;pecific gravities being as 11&frac13;, and 1,

<P>But if the globe were only 1/100 of an inch diameter, the greate&s;t velocities it could acquire, would be only 1/10 of the&s;e, namely 86/100 of a foot in water, and 26 feet nearly in air. And if the ball were &s;till farther dimini&s;hed, the greate&s;t velocity would al&s;o be dimini&s;hed, and that in the &s;ubduplicate ratio of the diameter of the ball.</P>

Note, the com|mon diameter of all the figures, was 6.375 or 6&frac38; inches; &s;o that the area of the circle of that diameter is ju&s;t 32 &s;quare inches, or 2/9 of a &s;quare foot; and the altitude of the cone was 6&frac58; inches. Al&s;o the diameter of the &s;mall hemi&s;phere was 4&frac34; inches, and con&s;equently the area of its ba&s;e is 17&frac34; &s;quare inches, or &frac18; of a &s;quare foot nearly.</P>
<P>The mean height of the barometer at the times of making the experiments, was nearly 30.1 inches, and of the thermometer 62&deg;; and con&s;equently the weight of a cubic foot of air was equal to 1&frac15; oz nearly in tho&s;e circum|&s;tances.</P>

<P>From this table of re&s;i&s;tances, &s;everal practical in|ferences may be drawn. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the re&s;i&s;tance is nearly as the &s;urface; the re&s;i&s;tance increa&s;ing but a very little above that proportion in the greater &s;urfaces. Thus, by comparing together the numbers in the 6th and la&s;t columns, for the ba&s;es of the two hemi&s;pheres, the areas of which are in the propor|tion of 17&frac34; to 32, or as 5 to 9 very nearly; but the numbers in tho&s;e two columns, expre&s;&s;ing the re&s;i&s;tances are nearly as 1 to 2, or as 5 to 10, as far as to the velocity
<PB N="236" REF="245">of 12 feet; after which the re&s;i&s;tances on the greater &s;urface increa&s;e gradually more and more above that pro|portion. And the mean re&s;i&s;tances are as 140 to 288, or as 5 to 10 2/7. This circum&s;tance therefore agrees nearly with the theory.</P>
<P N="2">2. The re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;ame &s;urface, is nearly as the &s;quare of the velocity; but gradually increa&s;es more and more above that proportion as the velocity increa&s;es. This is manife&s;t from all the columns. And therefore this circum&s;tance al&s;o nearly agrees with the theory, in &s;mall velocities.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the hinder parts of bodies are of different forms, the re&s;i&s;tances are different, though the fore parts be alike; owing probably to the different pre&s;&s;ures of the air on the hinder parts. Thus, the re&s;i&s;tance to the fore part of the cylinder is le&s;s than that on the flat ba&s;e of the he|mi&s;phere, or of the cone; becau&s;e the hinder part of the cylinder is more pre&s;&s;ed or pu&s;hed, by the following air, than tho&s;e of the other two figures.</P>
<P N="4">4. The re&s;i&s;tance on the ba&s;e of the hemi&s;phere, is to that on the convex &s;ide, nearly as 2&frac25; to 1, in&s;tead of 2 to 1, as the theory a&s;&s;igns the proportion. And there|fore in this particular, the theory is attended with a con|&s;iderable error.</P>
<P N="5">5. The re&s;i&s;tance on the ba&s;e of the cone, is to that on the vertex, nearly as 2 3/10 to 1, in&s;tead of 5&frac14; to 1, as the theory in pa. 223 art. 6 requires it to be. So that the theory in this in&s;tance gives le&s;s than half the true ex|perimented re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence we can find the altitude of a column of air, who&s;e pre&s;&s;ure &s;hall be equal to the re&s;i&s;tance of a body, moving through it with any velocity.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="246">Let <HI>a</HI> &equals; the area of the &s;ection of the body, &s;imilar to any of tho&s;e in the table, perpendicular to the di|rection of motion; <HI>r</HI> &equals; the re&s;i&s;tance to the velocity in the table; and <HI>x</HI> &equals; the altitude &s;ought, of a column of air, who&s;e ba&s;e is <HI>a,</HI> and its pre&s;&s;ure <HI>r.</HI> Then <HI>ax</HI> &equals; the content of the column in feet, and 1&frac15;<HI>ax</HI> or 6/5<HI>ax</HI> its weight in ounces; therefore 6/5<HI>ax</HI> &equals; <HI>r,</HI> and <HI>x</HI> &equals; &frac56; &times; <HI>r</HI>/<HI>a</HI> is the altitude &s;ought in feet, namely &frac56; of the quotient of the re&s;i&s;tance of any body divided by its tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection; which is a con&s;tant quantity for all &s;imilar bodies, however different in mag|nitude, &s;ince the re&s;i&s;tance <HI>r</HI> is as the &s;ection <HI>a,</HI> as we have found in art. 1. When <HI>a</HI> &equals; 2/9 of a foot, as in all the figures in our table, except the &s;mall hemi&s;phere; then <HI>x</HI> &equals; &frac56; &times; <HI>r</HI>/<HI>a</HI> becomes <HI>x</HI> &equals; 15/4 <HI>r,</HI> where <HI>r</HI> is the re&s;i&s;tance in our table to the &s;imilar body. If, for example, we take the convex &s;ide of the large hemi&s;phere, who&s;e re&s;i&s;tance is .634 oz to a velocity of 16 feet per &s;econd; then <HI>r</HI> &equals; .634, and <HI>x</HI> &equals; 15/4 <HI>r</HI> &equals; 2.3775 feet, is the altitude of the column of air who&s;e pre&s;&s;ure is equal to the re&s;i&s;tance on a &s;pherical &s;urface with a velocity of 16 feet. And to com|pare the above altitude with that which is due to the given velocity, it will be 32^2 &ratio; 16^2 &proportion; 16 &ratio; 4 the altitude due to the velocity 16; which is near double the altitude that is equal to the pre&s;&s;ure. And as the altitude is proportional to the &s;quare of the velocity, therefore, in &s;mall velocities, the re&s;i&s;tance to any &s;pherical &s;urface, is equal to the pre&s;&s;ure of a column of air on its great circle, who&s;e al|titude is 19/32 or .594 of the altitude due to its velocity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence we may infer the great re&s;i&s;tance &s;uffered by military projectiles. For we find in the table that a
<PB N="238" REF="247">globe of 6&frac38; inches diameter, which is equal to the &s;ize of an iron ball weighing 36 lb, moving with a velocity of only 16 feet per &s;econd, meets with a re&s;i&s;tance equal to the pre&s;&s;ure of &frac23; of an ounce weight; and therefore, com|puting only according to the &s;quare of the velocity, the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance that &s;uch a ball would meet with, when moving with a velocity of 1600 feet, would be equal to the pre&s;|&s;ure of 417 lb, and that independent of the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere it&s;elf on the fore part of the ball, which would be 480 lb more, as there would be no pre&s;&s;ure from the atmo&s;phere on the hinder part, in the ca&s;e of &s;o great a velocity as 1600 feet per &s;econd. So that the whole re|&s;i&s;tance would not be le&s;s than about 900 lb to &s;uch a velocity.</P>
<P N="8">8. Having &s;aid in the la&s;t article that the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere is taken intirely off the hinder part of the ball, moving with a velocity of 1600 feet per &s;econd; which mu&s;t happen when the ball moves fa&s;ter than the particles of air can follow by ru&s;hing into the place quitted and left void by the ball, or when the ball moves fa&s;ter than the air ru&s;hes into a vacuum from the pre&s;&s;ure of the incumbent air. Let us therefore inquire what this ve|locity is. Now the velocity with which any fluid i&s;&s;ues, depends upon its altitude above the orifice, and is indeed equal to the velocity acquired by a heavy body in falling freely through that altitude. But, &s;uppo&s;ing the height of the barometer to be 30 inches or 2&frac12; feet, the height of an uniform atmo&s;phere, all of the &s;ame den&s;ity as at the earth's &s;urface, would be 2&frac12; &times; 14 &times; 833&frac13; or 29166 feet; therefore &radic;16 &ratio; &radic;29166 &proportion; 32 &ratio; 8&radic;29166 &equals; 1366 feet, which is the velocity &s;ought. And therefore with a velocity of 1600 feet per &s;econd, or any velocity above 1366 feet, the ball mu&s;t continually leave a vacuum behind it, and &s;o mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain the whole pre&s;&s;ure of the
<PB N="239" REF="248">atmo&s;phere on its fore part, as well as the re&s;i&s;tance ari&s;ing from the vis inertia of the particles of air &s;truck by the ball.</P>
<P N="9">9. Upon the whole we find that the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, as determined by our experiments, differs very widely, both in re&s;pect to the quantity of it on all figures, and in re&s;pect to the proportions of it on oblique &s;urfaces, from the &s;ame as determined by the preceding theory, which is the &s;ame as that of Sir I&s;aac Newton, and mo&s;t modern philo&s;ophers. Neither &s;hould we &s;ucceed better if we have recour&s;e to the theory given by profe&s;&s;or Grave&s;ande, or others, as &s;imilar differences and incon&s;i&s;tencies &s;till occur.</P>
<P>We conclude therefore that all the theories of the re&s;i&s;tance of the air hitherto given, are very erroneous. And I have only laid down the preceding one, till further experiments on this important &s;ubject &s;hall enable us to deduce from them, another, that &s;hall be more con&s;onant to the true phenomena of nature.</P>
