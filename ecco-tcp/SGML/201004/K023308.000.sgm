<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of 1783 I publi&s;hed a book or pamphlet, intitled, "Remarks, critical and illu&s;trative, on the Text and Notes of the la&s;t Edition of Shak&s;peare," which, I under|&s;tand, has been repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t incorrect publication that ever appeared; and, indeed, from the li&s;t of <HI>errata</HI> in the book it&s;elf, and the additional one given at the end of this Preface, the charge does not &s;eem to be without founda|tion. There is, however, one work which, I believe, may vye with mine in point of inaccuracy, and that is the revi&s;|ed edition of John&s;on and Steevenses Shak&s;peare, which has &s;ince made its immaculate appearance, without the notifi|cation of a &s;ingle error <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A complete table of <HI>errata</HI> would be too arduous a ta&s;k, perhaps, for an individual; the book&s;ellers may therefor think them&s;elves obli|ged to any per&s;on that will contribute to it. I accordingly offer my mite, in the following brief but decent &s;pecimen of the accuracy of this famous edition.</P>

</LIST></NOTE>. I am, neverthele&s;s, far from
<PB N="iv" REF="3">meaning to reproach the learned gentleman who appears to have had the care of that edition, with the negligence of his printers; nor do I think my&s;elf at all more culpable on ac|count of the blunders of mine. Every per&s;on who has the entire revi&s;ion of his own pre&s;s-work will be &s;oon con|vinced, that nothing is &s;o truly incorrigible as <HI>a virgin proof &s;heet in its primitive &s;tate of unamendment.</HI> There is, how|ever, &s;ome little difference in printers; el&s;e mercy on the poor author!</P>
<P>Another charge which has been brought again&s;t me, is no le&s;s than downright <HI>felony.</HI> It &s;eems that &s;ome of my happie&s;t emendations had already appeared in the margin of the very edition I had pre&s;umed to critici&s;e; and the candour of the Critical Reviewers led them to conclude that I mu&s;t have &s;tole them ready made. Tho&s;e venerable per&s;onages, who have the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s to devote &s;ix days
<PB N="v" REF="4">in &s;even <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I conclude, that on <HI>Sunday</HI> the worthy critics "re&s;t from their labours," and go to <HI>Meeting.</HI> They are very good Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> to the &s;ervice of the public, in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence upon books which they never read, and on the character of writ|ers whom they do not know, could not for their &s;ouls com|prehend that two per&s;ons might happen to hit upon the &s;ame idea, or that one, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the idea of an|other, might, from a defective memory, or any other cau&s;e, come in time to imagine it his own. All that I can &s;ay upon this head, though I &s;hall not expect credit for my a&s;&s;ertion from the good-natured gentlemen I have ju&s;t mentioned, is, that at the time of the publication of the book, I was not aware of being anticipated in more than a &s;ingle in&s;tance, and even that one I thought my own.</P>
<P>Incorrect, however, and felonious as the&s;e &s;ame Re|marks might be, I found that the revi&s;ed Edition I have mentioned had got near 200 of them in its margin, all of which were received without oppo&s;ition; not to &s;peak of the alterations or corrections which I had a right to pre&s;ume my&s;elf the occa&s;ion of. There are a few in|deed which have not pa&s;&s;ed mu&s;ter, but, on the con|trary, are treated with &s;uch an air of peevi&s;hne&s;s, that I e&s;teem my&s;elf a very unnatural father of &s;o hopeful an off|&s;pring, in not having come forward in their vindication &s;ooner. It will be thought, perhaps, by &s;ome, altogether unrea&s;onable, that, after the editor of the revi&s;ed edition has adopted &s;o con&s;iderable a majority of my remarks, I &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to find &s;ault with him for his cavalier treatment of a few. I can only &s;ay, that is was not to me of the &s;malle&s;t con&s;equence whether he conde&s;cended to honour my publication with his notice or not; but I think it my duty to defend every part of it from injury and mi&s;|repre&s;entation. I know of no difference between the inte|grity or character of a writer and that of any other indi|vidual; nor ought an unju&s;t charge again&s;t the former to remain unrefuted, any more than one again&s;t the latter.
<PB N="vi" REF="5">"This defence, I allow, is rather of the late&s;t in making its appearance, and my liberal and candid friends above men|tioned will &s;carcely neglect the opportunity of paying my prudence a compliment, in having attended &s;o well to Ho|races rule. The fact is, that my notes were taken in turning over the revi&s;ed edition immediately after its pub|lication, but have till very lately been laid a&s;ide, and, in &s;hort, almo&s;t forgotten; and perhaps I only anticipate a plea&s;ant ob&s;ervation of my &s;mall friends, &s;o oft alluded to, in adding, that it would have proved no great lo&s;s if they had been altogether &s;o.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pretend to be ignorant that I have been ac|cu&s;ed of treating the mo&s;t eminent Editors, Commenta|tors, and Critics, with too little ceremory; and, indeed,
<Q><L>I fear I've wrong'd the honorable men</L>
<L>Who&s;e goo&s;e-quills have &s;tabb'd Shak&s;peare.</L></Q>
"If it be &s;o," it is unque&s;tionably "a grievous fault." But I can with great truth and ju&s;tice urge in my defence, that
<Q><L>I have no per&s;onal cau&s;e to &s;purn at them.</L>
<L>But for the general.</L></Q>
And that
<Q><L>How far I have proceeded in this matter,</L>
<L>Or how far further &s;hall, is warranted</L>
<L>By the example of preceeding critics,</L>
<L>Yea, the whole critic tribe.</L></Q></P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the re&s;pectable gentleman who had the care of the revi&s;ed edition, that &s;o far from meaning to treat him with the &s;lighte&s;t degree of levity or freedom, I do not con&s;ider him as re&s;pon&s;ible for any one of the notes which are the principal objects of the pre&s;ent pamphlet: I conclude them to have been furni&s;h|ed by &s;ome obliging friend, who has de&s;ired to be effectual|ly
<PB N="vii" REF="6">concealed under the &s;anction of the Editors &s;ignature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This worthy gentleman is probably the infamous &s;coundrel who publi&s;hed "An Addre&s;s to the curious in ancient poetry," as, however little relation it may have to Shak&s;peare, the author has had intere&s;t enough to procure it a place in the "Li&s;t of Detached Pieces of Critici&s;m, &amp;c." prefixed to the revi&s;ed edition. A congeniality of di&s;po&s;ition in the Critical Reviewers procured this fellow a diffe|rent reception from tho&s;e literary hangmen, from that which he may one day experience from a well known practical profe&s;&s;or of the &s;ame my&s;tery.</NOTE> If I could po&s;&s;ibly think this were not the ca&s;e, I am under too many obligations to that gentleman, in the cour&s;e of my different literary pur&s;uits, not to have ki&s;&s;ed the rod in &s;i|lence. However, I doubt not there are many things in the following pages which I might have been allowed to &s;ay, without running any po&s;&s;ible ri&s;k of giving offence to him; alive as an editor is on &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;aid to feel him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the end of the <HI>Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. I in&s;erted an adverti&s;e|ment of "an edition of the plays of Shak&s;peare," as then "preparing for the pre&s;s;" and &s;ome enquiries have been made when it would appear. In truth, the attention requi|&s;ite to the publication of &s;o voluminous a work, and the little likelihood there is of its being productive to the un|dertaker of any thing but trouble and expence, together with other cau&s;es of le&s;s con&s;equence, have hitherto de|terred me from putting it to the pre&s;s. But I have neither laid a&s;ide all thoughts of bringing it forward, nor can I pledge my&s;elf to produce it in any given time. I have little rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the Public intere&s;ts it&s;elf at all in the matter, and therefor think my&s;elf at full liberty to &s;uit my own inclination and convenience.</P>

<P>Vol. I. p. 155 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The paging in this pamphlet is generally from the revi&s;ed edi|tion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to what I have been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert in de|fence of Shak&s;peare, <NOTE PLACE="marg">REMARKS. p. 7.</NOTE> again&s;t the charge of taking a li|berty with his words, by &s;tretching them out to &s;uit the purpo&s;e of his metre, Mr. Tyrwhitt has ob&s;erved as fol|lows: "As to this <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> canon of the Engli&s;h language, it would be ea&s;y to &s;hew that it is quite fanciful and un|founded; and what he calls <HI>the right method of printing the above words,</HI> is &s;uch as, I believe, was never adopted be|fore by any mortal in writing them, nor can be followed in the pronunciation of them, without the help of an en|tirely new &s;y&s;tem of &s;pelling. But any further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the matter is unnece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e the hypothe&s;is, though allowed in its utmo&s;t extent, will not prove either of the points to which it is applied. It will neither prove that Shak&s;peare has not taken a liberty in extending cer|tain words, nor, that he has not taken that liberty chiefly with certain words in which <HI>l</HI> or <HI>r</HI> is &s;ubjoined to another con&s;onant. The following are all in&s;tances of nouns, &s;ub|&s;tantive or adjective, which can receive no &s;upport from the &s;uppo&s;ed canon. That Shak&s;peare has taken a liberty in extending the&s;e words, is evident, from the con&s;ideration
<PB N="2" REF="9">that the &s;ame words are more frequently u&s;ed by his con|temporaries, and by him&s;elf, without the additional &s;yllable.

<P>The learned and re&s;pectable writer of the&s;e ob&s;ervations is now unfortunately no more; but his opinions will not on that account have the le&s;s influence with the readers of the re|vi&s;ed edition of Shak&s;peare. I am therefor &s;till at liberty to enforce the ju&s;tice and propriety of my own &s;entiments, which I tru&s;t I &s;hall be found to do with all po&s;&s;ible deli|cacy toward the memory and character of the ingenious gentleman from whom I have the misfortune to differ.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive, that upon more mature con&s;idera|tion Mr. Tyrwhitt would have admitted, that if the me|thod of printing the words in que&s;tion were once proved to be right, it would be of little con&s;equence whether the di&s;covery had ever been adopted before, or could be follow|ed in pronunciation, without the help of an entire new &s;y&s;tem of &s;pelling: which in fact is the very object I mean to contend for; or rather for <HI>a &s;y&s;tem of &s;pelling,</HI> as I am perfectly confident we have none at pre&s;ent, or at lea&s;t I have never been able to find it. I &s;hall have rea&s;on to think my&s;elf peculiarly unfortunate if, after my hypothe|&s;is is allowed in its utmo&s;t extent, it will not prove what it was principally formed to do, viz. that Shak&s;peare has not taken a liberty in extending certain words to &s;uit the purpo&s;e of his metre. But &s;urely, if I prove that he has only written the words in que&s;tion as they ought to be written, I prove the whole of my po&s;ition, which of cour&s;e &s;hould cea&s;e to be termed or con&s;idered an hypothe&s;is. I may &s;afely admit, that the words in que&s;tion "are more frequently u&s;ed by his contemporaries, and by him&s;elf, without the additional &s;yllable;" but this will only &s;hew, that his contemporaries and him&s;elf have more frequently
<PB N="4" REF="11">taken the liberty of &s;hortening tho&s;e words than in writing them at length. Such a word as <HI>alarm'd,</HI> for in&s;tance, is generally, perhaps con&s;tantly, u&s;ed by poets as a di&s;&s;yl|lable; and yet, if we found it with its full power, <HI>alarmed,</HI> we &s;hould &s;carcely &s;ay that the writer had taken a liberty in lengthening it a &s;yllable. Thus too the word <HI>diamond</HI> is generally &s;poken as if two &s;yllables; but it is certainly three, and is &s;o properly given by Shak&s;peare:
<Q>Sir, I mu&s;t have that <HI>diamond</HI> from you.</Q>
The words <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>affection</HI> are u&s;ually pronounced, the one as con&s;i&s;ting of three, the other of four &s;yllables; but each, notwith&s;tanding, is really a &s;yllable longer:
<Q><L>With <HI>ob&s;ervation,</HI> the which he vents.</L>
<L>Yet have I fierce <HI>affections</HI> and think.</L></Q>
But examples of this nature would be endle&s;s.</P>
<P>Of the words quoted by Mr. Tyrwhitt, as in&s;tances of the liberty taken by Shak&s;peare, tho&s;e which I admit to be properly a &s;yllable &s;horter, certainly obtained the &s;ame pro|nunciation in the age of that author as he has annexed to them. Thus <HI>country, mon&s;trous, remembrance, a&s;&s;embly,</HI> were not only pronounced in Shak&s;peares time, the two former as <HI>three,</HI> the other as <HI>four</HI> &s;yllables, but <HI>are &s;o &s;till;</HI> and the rea&s;on, to borrow Mr. Tyrwhitts own words, "mu&s;t be obvious to every one who can pronounce the language."</P>
<P>"<HI>Henry</HI> was not only u&s;ually pronounced (as indeed it is &s;till) but frequently written as a tri&s;yllable, even in pro&s;e. Thus in Dr. Huttons Di&s;cour&s;e on the Antiquities of Ox|ford, at the end of Hearnes <HI>Textus Roffen&s;is,</HI>

<P>That Mr. Tyrwhitt &s;hould have treated the words <HI>angry, humbler, nobler,</HI> u&s;ed as tri&s;yllables, among tho&s;e which could "receive no &s;upport from the &s;uppo&s;ed ca|non," mu&s;t have been owing to the ob&s;cure or imperfect manner in which I attempted to explain it, as the&s;e are the
<PB N="5" REF="12">very in&s;tances which the canon, if a canon it mu&s;t be, is purpo&s;ely made to &s;upport, or rather by which it is to be &s;up|ported. This canon, in &s;hort, is nothing but a very &s;hort and &s;imple rule of Engli&s;h grammar, which has been repeated over and over: Every word, compounded upon the prin|ciples of the Engli&s;h language, always pre&s;erves the radical word unchanged. Thus <HI>humbler</HI> and <HI>nobler,</HI> for in&s;tance, are compo&s;ed of the adjectives <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>noble,</HI> and <HI>er,</HI> the &s;ign of the comparative degree; <HI>angry,</HI> of the noun <HI>anger,</HI> and <HI>y,</HI> the Saxon ig. In the u&s;e of all the&s;e as tri|&s;yllables Shak&s;peare is mo&s;t correct; and that he is no le&s;s &s;o in <HI>England,</HI> which u&s;ed to be pronounced as three &s;yllables, and is &s;o &s;till indeed with tho&s;e who do not ac|quire the pronunciation of their mother-tongue from the book, and &s;peech certainly preceded writing, will be evi|dent from the etymology, which &s;hould be more and attended to. Let us examine the word.&mdash;How is it to be divided? <HI>Eng-land,</HI> or <HI>En-gland?</HI> It will be evident that there is a defect &s;omewhere: but write it as it &s;hould be written, <HI>En-gle-land,</HI> and you have the meaning and etymology of the word and the origin of the nation at fir&s;t &s;ight, from the Saxon Englalanda, the land or country of the <HI>Angles;</HI> as in <HI>Scotland, Ireland, Finland, Lapland,</HI> the country of the <HI>Scot,</HI> the Ine, the <HI>Fin,</HI> the <HI>Lap:</HI> and yet, in de&s;pite of all &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, about half the words in the language are in the &s;ame awkward predicament.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf I have completely ju&s;tified this divine author from the charge of racking his words, as the tyrant did his captives. I hope too I have made it appear, that there is &s;omething defective and improper in the common methods of &s;pelling, or rather mis-&s;pelling. A learned and ingenious gentleman, who has undertaken a New Dic|tionary of the language upon an excellent plan, will have it very much in his power to introduce a &s;y&s;tematical re|form, which, once e&s;tabli&s;hed, would remain unvaried and invariable as long as the language endured. This John|&s;on might have had the honour of; but it is evident that he was very little acquainted with the principles and for|mation
<PB N="6" REF="13">of the words he undertook to explain. Every dic|tionary, to be perfect, &s;hould di&s;play a &s;y&s;tem of orthogra|phy, by dividing the words upon etymological principles. At fir&s;t &s;ight, one would think there was very little diffi|culty in this; and yet I know not that any grammarian or lexicographer has attempted it. Something of this kind has been effected in Italy, France, and Spain, by the diffe|rent academies there. And however violent the propo&s;ed reform may appear, it is certain, that if two or three of the fir&s;t printers in London were to adopt it, it would cea&s;e to be remarkable in half a year: but till this is done, it does not &s;eem worth the while of an individual to render <HI>his &s;elf</HI> &s;ingular, when he cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t probability of being able to convince the public of the propriety of his conduct; and there &s;eems no nece&s;&s;ity for making &s;uch a matter as <HI>this</HI> a point of con&s;cience.</P>

<P><PB N="10" REF="17">Though this learned and ingenious commentator might &s;ee no ground for &s;uppo&s;ing that I&s;abella held a ma&s;k in her hand, it does not follow that the notion is entirely groundle&s;s.

<P>In reply to the remark on this pa&s;&s;age, the gentleman who has a&s;&s;umed the &s;ignature of "The Editor," after la|menting the misfortune of the commentators and readers of Shak&s;peare, in having &s;o much of their time employed in explaining and contradicting unfounded conjectures and a&s;&s;ertions, produces and extract from Mr. Wartons <HI>Ob&s;ervations on Spen&s;ers Fairy Queen,</HI> to prove, that in Shak&s;peares time the notion of Fairies dying was gene|rally known; and adds, that Tickells poem, called <HI>Ken|&s;ington Gardens,</HI> will &s;hew that the opinion prevailed in the pre&s;ent century. A future editor of our author, he &s;ays, may, without any detriment to his work, omit this note, which he &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed to have had no occa&s;ion to incumber the page with.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on of feeling mu&s;t &s;urely &s;ympathi&s;e with an editor of Shak&s;peare, who, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of gentlemen in his &s;ituation, in&s;tead of the more agreeable employment of making unfounded conjectures and a&s;&s;ertions, is reduced to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of contra|dicting them; more e&s;pecially when, after all his toil and trouble, and writing about it and about it, the point is left pretty much the &s;ame as it was found. The real and often&s;ible editor of the revi&s;ed edition is a per&s;on of too exten&s;ive reading, as well as of too much good &s;en&s;e, to quote the fanciful genealogies of Spen&s;er, at &s;econd hand, to illu&s;trate a popular &s;uper&s;tition, with which, as he well knows, the <HI>Faerie Queene</HI> has not the remote&s;t connection. No one who has read even a &s;ingle canto of Spen&s;ers poem, can be ignorant of the di&s;&s;imilarity between <HI>his</HI> Fairies and the Fairies of Shak&s;peare; or that a &s;y&s;tem, imagined to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of allegory and allu&s;ion to real characters, has nothing in common with the vulgar opinion, to which in fact he has not been indebted for a
<PB N="12" REF="19">&s;ingle idea. Mr. Tickells poem I neither know where to find, nor think it worth my while to enquire after. I have &s;uch authority, however, for what the above candid and good-tempered p&s;eudo-editor is plea&s;ed to call an un|founded conjecture and a&s;&s;ertion, that, far from being di&s;|po&s;ed to retract and iota of what I have already advanced on the &s;ubject, I will venture to maintain the propriety of my opinion in its fulle&s;t extent, viz. that the Fairies of Shak|&s;peare and the common people are immortal, and were never e&s;teemed otherwi&s;e. And, fir&s;t, to &s;hew how little Spen&s;er is to be regarded as an authority in the matter, it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the doctrine of that poets ma&s;ter, the inimitable Ario&s;to, who expre&s;sly tells us that a Fairy <HI>can not</HI> die:

<P>Beaumont and Fletcher, I &s;hould conceive as good a voucher for the popular opinion of Shak&s;peares time as either Spen&s;er or Tickell. And &s;ee what they &s;ay in the <HI>Faith|ful Shepherde&s;s:</HI>
<Q><L>A virtuous well, about who&s;e flow'ry banks</L>
<L>The nimble-footed Fairies dance their rounds</L>

<L>Their &s;tolen children, <HI>&s;o to make 'em free</HI></L>
<L><HI>From dying fle&s;h, and dull mortality.</HI></L></Q>
Pretty conclu&s;ive evidence this, one &s;hould think! There is, indeed, a fooli&s;h Romance, intitled <HI>Huon de Bourdeaux,</HI> which had been turned into Engli&s;h long before Shak|&s;peares time, where Oberon, king of the Fairies, is made to dye and bequeath his dominions to Huon. And Mr. Steevens (vol. iii. 135.) mentions his having been inform|ed, that the originals of Oberon and Titania are to be &s;ought in this romance. They may be there &s;ought, in|deed, but I know, by woeful experience, they are not there to be found.</P>
<P>Shak&s;peare, I am convinced, was upon this occa&s;ion in|debted to no book whatever; unle&s;s it were the great book of &s;ociety, which he peru&s;ed and &s;tudied with &s;o much care.

<P>In an&s;wer to the REMARK on this pa&s;&s;age, the Editor of the revi&s;ed edition, or rather his &s;kulking friend, ob&s;erves, that "it is probable that Dr. John&s;on did not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of citing any authority for a fact &s;o well known, or &s;u&s;pect that any per&s;on would demand one. If an authority how|ever only is wanted," he &s;ays, "perhaps the following may be deemed &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the Doctors ob&s;ervation,&mdash;"at that time two other Engli&s;hmen, &s;ir W. Stanley and Rowland York, got an ignominious name of traytors, This Yorke, borne in London, was a man mo&s;t negligent
<PB N="20" REF="27">and lazy, but de&s;perately hardy; he was in his time the mo&s;t famous of tho&s;e who re&s;pected fencing, having been <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> that brought into England <HI>that wicked and perni|cious fa&s;hion</HI> to fight in the fields in duels <HI>with a rapier called a tucke onely for the thur&s;t. The Engli&s;h having till that very time u&s;ed to fight with backe &s;words, &s;la&s;hing and cutting one the other armed with targets or bucklers with very broad weapons, accounting it not to be a manly action to fight by thru&s;ting and &s;tabbing, and chiefly under the wa&s;te." Dar|cies Annals of Queen Elizabeth,</HI> 4to, 1623, p. 223. &s;ub anno 1587.</P>
<P>"Again, in <HI>Bulleines Dialogue between Soarne&s;&s;e and Chirurgi,</HI> fol. 1579, p. 20. "There is a <HI>new</HI> kynd of in|&s;truments to let bloud withall, whych brynge the bloud letter &s;ome tyme to the gallowes, becau&s;e hee &s;tryketh to deepe. The&s;e in&s;truments are called the ruffins tucke and <HI>long foining rapier:</HI> weapons more malicious than manly."</P>
<P>That Dr. John&s;on did not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of citing any authority to convict Shak&s;peare of this anachroni&s;m, or &s;u&s;pect that any per&s;on would demand one, is a little to the purpo&s;e as it is true that the fact is well known. If Dr. John&s;on had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any authority, there can be no doubt that he would have produced it; but, how|ever confident he may be in his a&s;&s;ertions, no one was ever more ignorant of the manners either of Shak&s;peares age or of the ages preceding it. But ignorant as he was, it would not have been difficult for him to have found autho|rities, which make as little in his favour as tho&s;e brought forward in the revi&s;ed edition. Dr. John&s;on has taken upon him&s;elf to a&s;&s;ert that the Rapier was a weapon not &s;een in England till 1599, that is, two centuries after the time of which Shak&s;peare was writing, and two years after the publication of this identical play; an a&s;&s;ertion which the author of the above note, out of his zeal for the credit of Dr. John&s;on, has pronounced a <HI>notorious fact,</HI> and produced what he calls a &s;ufficient authority to
<PB N="21" REF="28">ju&s;tify it. This authority, however, proves at mo&s;t no more than that <HI>a rapier,</HI> called <HI>a tucke</HI> "onely for the thur&s;t," had been introduced by a per&s;on who was hanged in 1587, and that <HI>"the long foining rapier"</HI> was a new kind of in&s;trument in 1579. The <HI>rapier</HI> NOT called a <HI>tucke,</HI> and for &s;omething more than the <HI>thur&s;t</HI> or the <HI>long foin,</HI> might, for any thing that yet appears to the contrary, have been an ordinary weapon long before either Yorke <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;hould appear from Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">letons <HI>Thankful Remembrance of Gods Mercy,</HI> 1625, as quoted by Mr. Malone in the notes to the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or</HI> (vol. i. p. 296) that York "was ..famous.. for bringing in a new kind of fight&mdash;to run the point of a <HI>rapier</HI> into a mans body. This manner of &s;ight <HI>he</HI> brought <HI>fir&s;t</HI> into England, &amp;c." That is, as I under&s;tand it, he did not bring the rapier it&s;elf into Eng|land, but only this new meanner of fighting with it.</NOTE>, Bulleine, or Shak&s;peare was born. But &s;uppo&s;ing it was not, what then? Shak&s;peare could have made u&s;e of the word <HI>rapier</HI> as a general name for a <HI>&s;word,</HI> the &s;pecies for the genus; and Dr. John&s;on might with equal propriety have objected to Julius Cae&s;ars &s;peaking Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Shak&s;peare has &s;o many anachroni&s;ms to an&s;wer for, that &s;ome people &s;eem to think it is no matter how many, real or pretended, they add to the number; which, as his &s;incere admirer, I am anxious &s;hould not be wantonly increa&s;ed. I will not, indeed, a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>rapier</HI> was actually known in this country under that very name in the time of king Richard the Second; but I &s;hall certainly think it &s;ufficient to prove, that it was familiar to us long before the time at which Shak&s;peare wrote; and let Dr. John&s;ons advocate &s;hew why both the poet and his readers have not a right to pre&s;ume it was &s;o in the times of which he was writing.</P>
<P>The fact I take to be this: the ancient rapier was a long two-edged &s;harp-pointed weapon, e&s;&s;entially different from that mentioned by Darcy and Bulleine, which was for the <HI>thru&s;t only,</HI> whereas the other was for <HI>both blow and thru&s;t.</HI> In a note to <HI>Much ado about Nothing</HI> (vol. ii. p.
<PB N="22" REF="29">263.) Mr. Steevens produces an extract from an old ma|nu&s;cript in the Sloane Library, "which &s;eems," he &s;ays, "to be the fragment of a regi&s;ter formerly belonging to &s;ome of our &s;chools, where the "noble Science of Defence was taught," from the year 1568 to 1583;" in which we find the following entry: "Item a challenge playde before the KINGS MAJESTIR (EDWARD VI.) at We&s;tmin&s;ter.. at &s;even kynde of weapons. That is to &s;ay,... the RA|PIER and TARGET, the <HI>rapier</HI> and <HI>cloke,</HI> &amp;c." And in another place Mr. Steevens, giving an account of this ma|nu&s;cript, expre&s;sly tells us that RAPIER and TARGET, <HI>rapier</HI> and <HI>cloke, rapier</HI> and <HI>dagger,</HI> were among the wea|pons u&s;ed in the fencing &s;chool. This I &s;hould conceive a &s;ufficient and &s;atisfactory proof, even to the gentleman who has &s;o zealou&s;ly undertaken to &s;upport the random and groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertion of Dr. John&s;on, that the <HI>rapier</HI> alluded to by Shak&s;peare was not <HI>a long foining tucke onely for the thur&s;te;</HI> and that he has not given "to the Engli&s;h nobles a weapon which was not &s;een in England till two centuries afterwards."</P>
<P>Independent of this adventitious a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Shak&s;peare him&s;elf has given &s;uch a de&s;cription of the rapier he meant, as could &s;carcely be overlooked but by an annotator le&s;s de|&s;irous to illu&s;trate his author than to &s;upport the ab&s;urdities of an editor. Thus in <HI>Twelfth Night</HI> (vol. iv. p. 254.)

And this, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, the learned gentle|man offers as a convincing argument&mdash;and &s;o indeed it may be, that he under&s;tands the pa&s;&s;age neither as it is nor as it &s;hould be. Why has not HE attempted to explain it? But, alas, we know by experience that &s;uch attempts, however they may increa&s;e difficulties, are ill calculated to remove them.</P>

<P>The ab&s;urdity of this reading is &s;o evident, and has been &s;o fully expo&s;ed in the REMARKS, that one, editor or commentator, has had the confidence to &s;ay a &s;ingle word in defence of it, except Mr. Malone, who&s;e candour and ingenuity are equally con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>He quotes a few words from a long note, where it was &s;aid that "it is <HI>the Duke of Exeter</HI> who enters," and tri|umphantly adds, that "in the only folio of authority this certainly is not the ca&s;e;" becau&s;e for&s;ooth the blundering editors have &s;uffered the name of <HI>Fluellen</HI> to &s;tand before a &s;peech evidently belonging to <HI>Exeter:</HI>
<Q>Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions.</Q>
Is this the language of <HI>Fluellen?</HI> Does <HI>Fluellen</HI> ever &s;peak in heroics? Or is it po&s;&s;ible that this line, and the pitiful &s;tuff which the editors have &s;o judiciously preferred:&mdash; "'Splood!&mdash;up to the preaches, you ra&s;cals! will you not up to the preaches?" can belong to one and the &s;ame per&s;on? Certainly not. But then, he argues, "when the king retired, the duke of Exeter undoubtedly accompanied him:" And &s;uppo&s;e he did, what then? Is he never to come upon the &s;tage again?</P>
<P>As to his a&s;&s;ertion, that "<HI>Duke</HI> means no more here than <HI>commander;</HI>" nothing bad enough can be &s;aid of it. Will he have the goodne&s;s to produce on &s;ingle in&s;tance from "the language of our author," in which the title has any &s;uch meaning? <HI>"Duke The&s;eus,"</HI> every one who has looked into the <HI>Mid&s;ummer Nights Dream,</HI> not excepting him&s;elf, very well knows, is <HI>"The&s;eus Duke of Athens."</HI> And though Skelton or any other ancient writer may have called

<P>In an&s;wer to the Remark on this pa&s;&s;age (a Remark which I have &s;ince learned is not peculiar to my&s;elf) Mr. Steevens &s;ays it has been ob&s;erved by two or three commentators, that it is no way extraordinary the king &s;hould forget his wifes name, as it appears in no le&s;s than three places &s;he forgets it her&s;elf, calling her&s;elf <HI>Eleanor.</HI> It has been al&s;o &s;aid, it &s;hould be <HI>Meg.</HI> And though he allows all this <HI>to be very true,</HI> yet as an alterations <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be made, Theobalds, he &s;ays, is <HI>ju&s;t as good</HI> and as <HI>probable</HI> as <HI>any other.</HI> He has, therefor, retained it, and wi&s;hes it could have been done with propriety without a note.</P>
<P>I leave it to every reader to form his own conclu&s;ions on this extraordinary note, which I only wonder to find avow|ed by Mr. Steevens. No unprejudiced per&s;on tan he&s;itate for a moment in admitting this conclu&s;ion, that as Shak|&s;peare has already inadvertently u&s;ed <HI>Eleanor</HI> for <HI>Margaret</HI> no le&s;s than three times, &s;o he here u&s;es <HI>Nell</HI> for <HI>Meg.</HI> With what rea&s;on therefor can it be &s;aid, that <HI>Well</HI> is ju&s;t as good and as probable an alteration as any other: an al|teration which Theobald, had he noticed the repeated mi&s;|take of <HI>Eleanor</HI> for <HI>Margaret,</HI> would never have propo&s;ed? di&s;covery him&s;elf!</P>

<P>The ridiculous &s;tory of Warwicks emba&s;&s;y and the lady Bona,<NOTE PLACE="marg">REMARKS, p. 129.</NOTE> ought to be bani&s;hed out of hi&s;tory; and yet Mr. Hume gives it as circum&s;tantially as if he had found it in a record: whereas there is not even a po&s;&s;ibility of its having any foundation whatever, as Warwick actually &s;tood &s;pon&s;or to the prince&s;s Elizabeth, king Edwards fir&s;t child <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hume indi&s;putably merits great prai&s;e as an elegant and nervous writer; but he has in numerous in&s;tances &s;hewn an evident di&s;regard to facts, varying and even inventing circum&s;tances, for the mere purpo&s;e, it &s;hould &s;eem, of telling his &s;tory to greater advantage, or giving a &s;ort of roundne&s;s or point to his periods. For this rea&s;on his Hi&s;tory is in many parts no more to be regarded than a Romance, as he neither does nor was able to quote any authority for what he relates. Among the many in&s;tances which might be adduced in &s;up|port of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, I &s;hall only mention a remarkable anecdote of Colonel Kirk, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have debauched a young woman, the &s;i&s;ter (but according to other, the wife) or one of the We&s;tern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">worde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, under a &s;olemn promi&s;e to grant her the life of her brother, as the price of her compliance. In the morning, to gratify her impatience, he in|&s;ultingly &s;hews her this beloved brother hanging upon a gibbet, which he had &s;ecretly ordered to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d before the window (or as &s;ome &s;ay upon the &s;ign po&s;t) of his inn. The con&s;equence is, that the young woman goes di&s;tracted, and the colonel to breakfa&s;t. This &s;tory Mr. Hume has worked up with all his powers of eloquence and pathos; and being &s;o very intere&s;ting, no doubt is ever entertained of its truth. Although in fact, &s;o far as it regards Kirk or the reign of James the Second or the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, it is an impudent and barefaced lye. Mr. Hume indeed was not the fabricator of the fal&s;ehood; but his conduct is not the more excu&s;able on that account, &s;ince he had no|thing to warrant it that could de&s;erve the name of an authority, and a &s;tory that does outrage to human nature, ought not to be adopted by a hi&s;torian without a voucher equal to its incredibility. The origin of the fable was probably owing to the <HI>pious fraud</HI> of the Whig party, to whom Kirk had rendered him&s;elf &s;o odious, that they endeavour of to blacken his character with every action &s;uperlatively abominable which they could find recorded. Many le&s;s important and more pro|bable calumnies remain unnoticed in the libels of the day; but this &s;tory, and &s;ome other circum&s;tances mentioned by Mr. Hume, &s;uch, as his hanging 19 without the lea&s;t enquiry into the merits of their cause, ordering a certain number to be executed, while he and his compan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould drink to the king's health; crying, when he ob&s;erved their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to &s;hake in the agonies of death, that he would give them <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>dancing,</HI> &amp;c. which exceed every thing one can conceive of the ex|tent of human wickedne&s;s, were greedily &s;wallowed and the become<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of the Hi&s;tory of England. I do not indeed que&s;tion but that there are many wives and many &s;i&s;ters who would &s;hew the very &s;ame degree of affection for their hu&s;bands or their brothers; but the other part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;tory is out of nature, and can only be credible of an <HI>incubus;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of infernal malice which religion can teach and bi|gots credit, could not exceed that which is thus reported of Kirk.

<PB N="31" REF="38">Warwick took occa&s;ional umbrage at &s;everal of the kings proceedings: As, 1. his marrying the queens &s;i&s;ter to the duke of Buckingham; 2. his conferring the office of trea|&s;urer (which he had taken from the lord Montjoy) upon lord Rivers; 3. his making a match between the &s;on and heir of the lord Herbert and Mary the queens &s;i&s;ter, and another between the young lord Li&s;le and the daughter of lord Herbert, and creating young Herbert a knight and lord of Dun&s;tar; 4. his making a match between &s;ir Tho|mas Gray, the queens &s;on, and Lady Anne, daughter and heir to the duke of Exeter, and niece to the king, who had been talked of as a wife for the earl of Northumberland, Warwicks brother. But here the annals of William Wyr|ce&s;ter, to whom we are indebted for this valuable in|formation, are mo&s;t unfortunately defective. However, it appears from Rymer, that in the beginning of November 1469, no open variance had taken place between the king and Warwick; though the latter had certainly been accu&s;|ed of favouring king Henry, and had &s;ecretly di&s;plea&s;ed the king by the propo&s;ed match between his daughter and the duke of Clarence. On the 23d March 1470 he and the duke were in arms and proclaimed rebels.</P>
