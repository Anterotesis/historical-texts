<HEAD>A CHRONOLOGICAL REMARK, Nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by all Readers of HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>GREEK Authors always date from the Creation of the World. They reckon, to the fir&s;t Year of the Chri&s;tian Aera, 5503; &s;o that, when we meet in them the Dates of any Events &s;ince the Birth of our Saviour, we need only &s;ubtract 5508, to have, in the Remainder, the Year of the common Aera. Thus, according to the Greek Hi&s;torians, the fir&s;t Council of Nice was held in the Year 5833; &s;ubtract 5508, and there remains 325, the Year of Chri&s;t in which that Council was a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>In like manner, when Events are dated by the Years of Rome, we need only &s;ub|tract 753, to have, in the Remainder, the common Years. For example, Tiberius died in the Year of Rome 790; from 790, take 753, and the Remainder, 37, is the Year of Chri&s;t in which that Prince's Death happened.</P>

<ITEM>1330. July 16, there happened a great eclip&s;e of the &s;un, and the rains were &s;o violent this year, that the harve&s;t did not begin till Mi|chaelmas. At Chri&s;tmas, a mighty we&s;terly wind overthrew &s;everal private hou&s;es and pub|lic edifices, tore up trees by the root, and did a va&s;t deal of mi&s;chief.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1335. The rains were &s;o fatal, that the corn was &s;poiled; a dearth en&s;ued, wheat being &s;old at forty &s;hillings a quarter, as much as twenty &s;hillings a bu&s;hel now; and the cattle was de|&s;troyed by a murrain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1338.

<ITEM>1348. It rained from Mid&s;ummer to Chri&s;tmas, &s;o that there was not one day or night d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y toge|ther. This wet &s;ea&s;on cau&s;ed great floods, and a pe&s;tilence, which raged for a whole year. The earth was at the &s;ame time barren, and
<PB N="49" REF="53">even the &s;ea did not produce &s;uch plenty of fi&s;h as formerly. The mortality was &s;o great, that, in the city of London, two hundred bodies were buried every day in the Charter-hou&s;e yard, be|&s;ides tho&s;e interred in other common burying|places; and this la&s;ted from Candlemas to Ea&s;ter.</ITEM>

<ITEM>1359. When King Edward was on his march, within two leagues of Chartres, there happen|ed a mo&s;t dreadful hurricane of deadly piercing wind, that &s;welled a tempe&s;t of rain, light|ning, and hail-&s;tones, &s;o prodigious, as to kill in&s;tantly &s;ix thou&s;and of his hor&s;es, and a thou|&s;and of his be&s;t troops.</ITEM>
<ITEM>1360. Men and bea&s;ts were de&s;troyed in &s;everal parts of England, by thunder and lightening; many hou&s;es were burnt and ruined by it, and &s;trange &s;ights were al&s;o &s;een.</ITEM>

Several &s;hips were da&s;hed in pieces in the har|bour, and the &s;hip, in which the Queen came over, was &s;hattered and broken; which was the more ob&s;ervable, becau&s;e his &s;econd wife brought a &s;torm with her to the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts, in which the King's baggage was lo&s;t, and many &s;hips of his fleet ca&s;t away. <HI>Sir J.
