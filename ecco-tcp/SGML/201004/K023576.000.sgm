<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. MALONE, in the year 1780, when pub|li&s;hing a <HI>Supplement to Shak&s;peare</HI> of plays which he never wrote, mode&s;tly remarked that <HI>by a di|ligent collation of all the old copies thitherto di&s;co|vered, and the judicious re&s;toration of ancient readings, the text of this author &s;eemed then finally &s;ettled.</HI> Since that period, however, he has been labouring "with uncea&s;ing &s;olicitude," for the &s;pace of "eight years" to convince the public that he had, if not directly a&s;&s;erted the thing which was not, at lea&s;t gone a little further than was con&s;i&s;tent with the exact &s;tate of the ca&s;e. For, if the text had been already <HI>diligently collated</HI> with <HI>all the old copies,</HI> why &s;hould he make &s;uch a parade of having collated it him&s;elf? If it had not been &s;o collated, why &s;hould he &s;ay it had? This fact is therefor manife&s;t, upon Mr. Malones own evidence, that the text of Shak|&s;peare had never been collated, whether diligently or not, with all or any of the old copies, by any per&s;on before Mr. Malone. To which one may add that even this great critics collation has not been either &s;o diligent or &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as he would
<PB N="viii" REF="8">induce us to believe;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of this the following in&s;tances, occa&s;ionally noticed, in the <HI>two fir&s;t</HI> vols. may &s;erve as the &s;pecimen of a proof:

<ITEM>Vol. I. p. 155. "And that <HI>I cannot</HI> help." In the old editions&mdash;<HI>cannot I.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Vol. I. p. 174. "As ea&s;ily as I do tear <HI>this</HI> paper." Both folios read&mdash;<HI>his.</HI></ITEM>

"Let me hear you &s;peak <HI>further.</HI>" Both edi|tions&mdash;<HI>farther;</HI> a word entirely different from <HI>further,</HI> though too frequently confounded with it by ignorant per&s;ons: the one being the com|parative of <HI>forth;</HI> the other a corruption of <HI>farer.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>Vol. II. p. 190. "And much different from the man he was," The folios read: "And much <HI>much</HI> different;"&mdash;the additional &s;yllable being nece&s;&s;ary to the metre, which the editor could not perceive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Vol. II. p. <HI>Ibi.</HI> "And <HI>therefore</HI> came it that the man was mad." In the old copies&mdash;"And <HI>thereof</HI> came it."</ITEM>
<ITEM>Vol. II. p. 477. "Through the fore&s;t have I gone, "But Athenian <HI>found</HI> I none." All the old editions read&mdash;<HI>find,</HI> which is not only more elegant but more grammatical.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There is not rea&s;on to believe that each of the remaining volumes would not have contributed an equal number of the&s;e damning proofs; but in fact the &s;earch required too large a portion of both time and patience.</P></NOTE> and al&s;o that it would have been much better for the &s;aid text if he had never collated it at all. By a <HI>judicious re&s;toration of ancient readings,</HI> Mr. Malone &s;eems to under&s;tand the re|placing of all the gro&s;s and palpable blunders of the fir&s;t folio, from which it has been the labour of &s;uch
<PB N="vii" REF="9">critics as Rowe, Pope, Theobald, Warburton, and Hanmer to purge the text. Mr. Malone is a critic of a very different de&s;cription.</P>
<P>I have thought proper, in the following pages, to make a few ob&s;ervations on &s;ome of Mr. Malones notes. Now Mr. Malone will take this exceedingly ill; for Mr. Malone has a very high opinion of him&s;elf, and a very mean one of every body el&s;e. But I confe&s;s I do not &s;eek to plea&s;e Mr. Malone: I wi&s;h to re&s;cue the language and &s;en&s;e of an ad|mirable author from the barbari&s;m and corruption they have acquired in pa&s;&s;ing through the hands of this incompetent and unworthy editor. In a word, I mean to convict and not to convince him.</P>
<P>The total want of <HI>ear</HI> and <HI>judgement,</HI> under which Mr. Malone will be found to labour, is undoubt|edly a natural defect, for which he would be an
<PB N="viii" REF="10">object rather of pity than of reprehen&s;ion, if he had not forced him&s;elf into an employment for which ear and judgement were e&s;&s;ential, and nature, of cour&s;e, in depriving him of tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ites, had utterly di&s;qualifyed him. Want of courage, in a common man, may be con&s;idered as mere weakne&s;s of nerves; in a commander, it is puni&s;hed with death.</P>
<P>But it is not the want of ear and judgement only of which I have to accu&s;e Mr. Malone: he &s;tands charged with divers other high crimes and mi&s;de|meanors again&s;t the divine maje&s;ty of our &s;overeign lord of the drama; with deforming his text, and de|grading his margin, by intentional corruption, fla|grant mi&s;repre&s;entation, malignant hypercritici&s;m, and unexampled &s;currility. The&s;e charges &s;hall be proved&mdash;not, as Mr. Malone proves things, by groundle&s;s opinion and confident a&s;&s;ertion, but&mdash;by fact, argument, and demon&s;tration. How &s;aye&s;t thou, culprit? Guilty or not guilty?</P>
<P>Whoever may think fit to cen&s;ure the language of the&s;e "critici&s;ms," Mr. Malone has no &s;uch right; having him&s;elf rifled the blooming beds of Billings-gate to grace his commentaries with the choice&s;t rhetorical flowers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;eldom introduces the author of the <HI>Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. without a compliment on his <HI>profound ignorance</HI> or <HI>crude notions,</HI> the <HI>feeble|ne&s;s of his attempts at jocularity,</HI> the <HI>&s;lenderne&s;s of his critici&s;m,</HI> and the like; or the favourite epithet of <HI>a &s;hallow</HI> or <HI>half-informed remarker.</HI> "And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges."</NOTE> It is &s;urely lawful to return an
<PB N="ix" REF="11">enemy the &s;hot of his own poi&s;oned arrows: and, as for the re&s;t, whatever re&s;pect may be due to the errors of genius, the blunders of ignorance and pre|&s;umption de&s;erve no quarter.</P>
<P>&dtristar; Since the&s;e &s;heets were printed off, Mr. Malone has i&s;&s;ued propo&s;als for a new and &s;plendid edition of the plays and poems of this admired author, IN FIFTEEN VOLUMES ROYAL QUARTO!!! The reciprocal good opinion which the public and Mr. Malone appear to entertain of each other does both parties infinite honour; the one from his &s;ingular confidence, the other from its refined ta&s;te. Having &s;ufficiently, and, I tru&s;t, &s;atis|factorily, proved how peculiarly qualifyed this inge|nious gentleman is for an editor of our great poet, I have only to add my &s;incere&s;t wi&s;hes that com|pletion of &s;o magnificent a work may happen in time to afford me another equally favorable oppor|tunity of giving my humble te&s;timony to his very extraordinary merit.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>O! while, along the &s;tream of time, thy name</L>
<L>Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame,</L>

<P>THERE cannot well be a more flagrant proof of di&s;ingenuity in the &s;upport of a particular opinion than is here manife&s;ted by the editor in his treatment of the <HI>&s;econd folio,</HI> in order to &s;ub&s;tantiate his po&s;ition "that the editor of that book was intirely ignorant of our poet phra&s;eology and metre; and that various alterations were made by him, in con&s;equence of that ignorance, which render his edition of no value whatever." Many of the in&s;tances adduced in &s;up|port of this a&s;&s;ertion are mere &s;elf-evident errors of the pre&s;s, the accidental omi&s;&s;ion or in&s;ertion of a &s;ingle word, or the inadvertent tran&s;po&s;ition of a couple of letters;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>One pa&s;&s;age of this kind is very remarkable. The fir&s;t folio reading.</P>
<P>Is &s;traightway <HI>calm</HI> and boarded with a pirate</P>
<P>The editor of the &s;econd edition, or &s;ome one for him, had added the <HI>d;</HI> and the printer made it <HI>claim'd.</HI> So where, in&s;tead of <HI>Car|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at,</HI> in the fir&s;t folio, the &s;econd has <HI>Raccat;</HI> and in&s;tead of <HI>vigi|lance, viligance,</HI> we are to impute the compo&s;itors carele&s;sne&s;s to ignorance or intentional corruption.</P></NOTE> faults to which every copy is
<PB N="2" REF="13">equally &s;ubject; and con&s;equently prove that editors ignorance much le&s;s than his accu&s;ers malice; which is the more remarkable as he has actually availed him&s;elf of a very con&s;iderable number of the cor|rections of the identical edition which he thus anxi|ously labours to depreciate as a &s;ink of ignorance and corruption. It mu&s;t be evident, that by this par|tial mode of proceeding, the &s;ame charge might be brought home not only to the fir&s;t folio, but to almo&s;t any edition of any author. A per&s;on who had only truth and ju&s;tice in view would have exhibited a faithful &s;tatement, a fair debtor and creditor ac|count of the merits and defects of the two editions. But this method, Mr. Malone is con&s;cious, &s;o far from an&s;wering his purpo&s;e, would have completely disproved and give the <HI>lye direct</HI> to his accu&s;ation; &s;ince, in fact, for <HI>one</HI> in&s;tance of an alteration for the wor&s;e it will be ea&s;y to produce <HI>ten</HI> in&s;tances of alterations for the better, and &s;uch, at the &s;ame time, as not only no ignorant or capricious per&s;on, but not even a man of &s;en&s;e and &s;agacity would have hit upon, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of manu&s;cript correc|tions or per&s;onal information: and after all, it is not in the lea&s;t improbable that both editions were printed by one and the &s;ame per&s;on, there being only <HI>nine</HI> years difference in their dates, and the one, whether intentionally or otherwi&s;e, ju&s;t as in|accurate as the other. Both editors, at lea&s;t, if two there were, were Shak&s;peares contemporaries; pro|bably
<PB N="3" REF="14">his acquaintance; po&s;&s;ibly his friends; and, in all events, equally familiar with the language of his time and his peculiar phra&s;eology. But, leaving Mr. Malones partiality and ingratitude out of the que&s;tion, I am by no means di&s;po&s;ed to admit his judgement as to any ones ignorance of Shak&s;peares phra&s;eology and metre: in neither of which, I believe, we &s;hall find him a proficient. Some of the&s;e identical in|&s;tances prove the direct rever&s;e of what they are brought to do, and convict the pro&s;ecutor of both ignorance and malignity.</P>
<P N="1">I. "His[<HI>i. e.</HI> the &s;econd editors] ignorance of Shak&s;peares phra&s;eology" con&s;i&s;ts in printing&mdash;</P>
<P>"I can go <HI>no</HI> further," in&s;tead of "I can <HI>not</HI> go <HI>no</HI> further;"</P>
<P>"<HI>I</HI> appointed him," in&s;tead of "<HI>I am</HI> appointed him," the &s;yllable having &s;lipped out in the pre&s;s:</P>
<P>"The way to <HI>&s;tudy</HI> death," in&s;tead of "the way to <HI>du&s;ty</HI> death;" a mere accidental tran&s;po&s;ition of two letters; which is con&s;tantly happening. The following is of more con&s;equence.</P>
<P>"The &s;eventh [fifth] &s;cene of the fourth act of this play <HI>[Antony and Cleopatra]</HI> concludes with the&s;e words:&mdash;"Di&s;patch,&mdash;Enobarbus!" Anthony, who, is the &s;peaker, de&s;ires his attendant <HI>Eros</HI> to di&s;patch, and then pronounces the name <HI>Enobarbus,</HI> who had recently de&s;erted him, and who&s;e lo&s;s he here la|ments. But there being no per&s;on in the &s;cene but Eros, and the point being inadvertently omitted
<PB N="4" REF="15">after the word <HI>di&s;patch,</HI> the editor of the &s;econd folio &s;uppo&s;ed that Enobarbus mu&s;t have been an error of the pre&s;s, and therefore reads;
<Q>"Di&s;patch, <HI>Eros.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Such is Mr. Malones account of the matter, in which it is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply a &s;mall omi&s;&s;ion of the very accurate writer, <HI>viz.</HI> that the line, of which the two words in que&s;tion are part, is in|tended for metre, of which he is too good a judge for the omi&s;&s;ion to have been de&s;igned. This in|tention, however, would be defeated by the word <HI>Enobarbus;</HI> unle&s;s we are to accent it thus:
<Q><L>&mdash;my fortunes have</L>
<L>Corrupted hone&s;t men. Di&s;patch.&mdash;<HI>Eno~ba~rbu~s?</HI></L></Q>
Antony is continually repeating the name of Eros; he does it no le&s;s than five times in the preceding &s;cene, and once before in this. The manu&s;cript, it is probable, had, in this place, only an <HI>E.</HI> of which the original printer improperly made <HI>Enobarbus:</HI> this mi&s;take mu&s;t have been &s;ome how or other made known to the editor of the &s;econd folio, mo&s;t likely by a MS. correction in the copy he printed from; he has therefor rightly corrected the word, but, at the &s;ame time, has neglected to ob&s;erve the tran&s;po&s;ition which had been made by his predece&s;&s;or (&s;uppo&s;ing the printer of each copy two different per&s;ons). Take the line, therefor, as Shak&s;peare
<PB N="5" REF="16">gave it, and let us acknowlege our obligation to the &s;econd folio, for &s;o valuable an alteration:
<Q>Corrupted hone&s;t men.&mdash;<HI>Eros! di&s;patch.</HI></Q>
If he had meant that Anthony &s;hould apo&s;trophi&s;e his ab&s;ent officer, he would have given it thus:
<Q>Corrupted hone&s;t men.&mdash;<HI>O Enobarbus!</HI></Q>
The editor of the &s;econd folio was therefor right in &s;uppo&s;ing, if indeed he was not &s;ure, "that Eno|barbus mu&s;t have been an error of the pre&s;s."</P>
<P>"In <HI>K. Henry VIII.</HI> are the&s;e lines
<Q><L>"&mdash;If we did think</L>
<L>"His <HI>contemplation</HI> were above the earth,&mdash;"</L></Q>
Not under&s;tanding this phra&s;eology, and &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>were</HI> mu&s;t require a noun in the plural number, he reads:
<Q><L>"&mdash;If we did think</L>
<L>His <HI>contemplations</HI> were above the earth, &amp;c."</L></Q></P>
<P>Now, one would be glad to know where there is a &s;ingle per&s;on to be found, &s;etting a&s;ide this petulant dogmati&s;t, who ever heard of &s;uch a phra&s;eology, or who does not know "that <HI>were</HI> mu&s;t require a noun in the plural number."</P>
<P>It would be well if charges of no better founda|tion or greater &s;trength could be brought again&s;t the ignorance of M. Malone.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="17">II. "Let us now examine how far he was ac|quainted with the <HI>metre</HI> of the&s;e plays." Ay marry, now for it; this is a &s;ubject upon which we are quite at home.</P>
<Q><L>"In the <HI>Winter's Tale,</HI> we find,&mdash;</L>
<L>"What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?</L>
<L>"In leads, or oils?"&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>"Not knowing that <HI>fires</HI> was u&s;ed as a di&s;&s;yllable he added the word <HI>burning</HI> at the end of the line."</P>
<P>He did &s;o; and it will be evident to every one who can read that the addition was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, in point of quantity, to the perfection of the line. Mr. Malone can <HI>not</HI> read, and is totally ig|norant of the con&s;equences of his own ab&s;urd ideas; he could never el&s;e have thought &s;uch a line as the following con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of metre:
<Q>"What wheels? racks? <HI>fi-ers?</HI> what <HI>flay|ing? boiling?</HI></Q>
Thus, however, he in&s;i&s;ts that Shak&s;peare intended us to read&mdash;<HI>&s;wor-en, cha-rums,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;worn, charms; &s;u-ar,</HI> for <HI>&s;ure,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. converting one &s;yllable into two, two into three or four and &s;o on.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of
<Q>"And &s;o to <HI>arms,</HI> victorious <HI>noble</HI> father,"</Q>
with the <HI>&s;econd</HI> folio, we are to read
<PB N="7" REF="18">
<Q>"And &s;o to <HI>a-rums, vic-to-ri~-ous</HI> father,"</Q>
becau&s;e <HI>noble,</HI> or &s;ome other word of equal quantity, has been omited by the printer of the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;tead of
<Q>"<HI>But</HI> prove it, <HI>Henry,</HI> and thou &s;halt be king."</Q>
As given by the editor of the &s;econd folio, "not knowing Henry to be u&s;ed as a tri&s;yllable," we are to read:
<Q>"Prove it <HI>He-ne~-ry,</HI> and &s;halt be king."</Q></P>
<P>In&s;tead of
<Q>"Pours into captains wounds! <HI>ha!</HI> bani&s;h|ment.</Q>
<HI>pours</HI> being a di&s;&s;yllable, we are to adopt the follow|ing harmonious line:
<Q>"<HI>Po-u~rs</HI> in-<HI>to~ cap-ta~ins</HI> wounds! bani&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P>In&s;tead of
<Q>She's tickled now, her fume <HI>can</HI> need no &s;purs.</Q>
he thinks it more in the authors manner to read:
<Q>"She's <HI>tickcle~d</HI> now; <HI>he~r</HI> fume needs no &s;purs,"</Q></P>
<P>In&s;tead of
<Q><L>"The body of <HI>the</HI> city, country, court:"</L>
<L>"The body of <HI>ci-ty, coun-te~-ry,</HI> court."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="19">And In&s;tead of
<Q><L>"<HI>Burn</HI> hotter than my faith. O but <HI>dear</HI> &s;ir.</L>
<L>"<HI>Bu-u~rn hot-te~r</HI> than <HI>my~</HI> faith. O but &s;ir."</L></Q></P>
<P>"The editor, indeed" he &s;ays, "was even igno|rant of the author's manner of accenting words, for in the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> where we find,
<Q><L>"&mdash;Spirits, which by mine art</L>
<L>"I have from their <HI>confines</HI> call'd to enact</L>
<L>"My pre&s;ent fancies,"&mdash;</L></Q>
he exhibits the &s;econd line thus:
<Q>"I have from <HI>all</HI> their <HI>c&ograve;nfines</HI> call'd to enact."</Q>
It is &s;omewhat lucky, however, for the editor of the &s;econd folio, that we are able to produce in his de|fence no le&s;s deci&s;ive a te&s;timony than that of Shak|&s;peare him&s;elf. The word in que&s;tion occurs in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar:</HI>
<Q><L>"And Cae&s;ar's &s;pirit, ranging for revenge,</L>
<L>"Shall, on the&s;e <HI>c&ograve;nfines,</HI> with a monarch's voice,</L>
<L>"Cry havock, and let &s;lip the dogs of war."</L></Q></P>
<P>The reader will now judge for him&s;elf which of the&s;e two editors, the pro&s;ecutor or defendant, is mo&s;t ignorant of his authors "phra&s;eology, metre," and "manner of accenting words."</P>
<P>"Had he con&s;ulted the original quarto," &s;ays M. Malone, "he would have found that the poet
<PB N="9" REF="20">wrote"&mdash;&s;o and &s;o. Well, but how if he could not get, or never heard of the original quarto? how then? Had he not, in common with every other edi|tor, the right of &s;upplying imperfections or correcting mi&s;takes, according to the be&s;t of his judgement? It is no imputation upon the &s;agacity of Dr. Thirlby or &s;ir Thomas Hammer that they have &s;ugge&s;ted readings, which, however plau&s;ible, are di&s;proved by the more recent di&s;covery of the old quartos: all of which have not been yet &s;een, even by Mr. Malone; who has, at the &s;ame time, been indebted to chance or favour for many of the others; for which he has not, on every occa&s;ion, made the mo&s;t grateful or liberal return.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to make the editor of the &s;econd folio &s;ome amends for the inju&s;tice, malevo|lence, and per&s;onal abu&s;e of his Hibernian adver&s;ary, by di&s;playing a few in&s;tances not only of his actual &s;uperiority to his predece&s;&s;or (if, in fact, either edi|tion had any other editor than the compo&s;itor of the pre&s;s), but al&s;o where that &s;uperiority is admitted by Mr. Malones own adoption. The latter ca&s;e is di&s;tingui&s;hed by an a&s;teri&s;k. It was once my intention to have given, what Mr. Malone ought to have done, a fair and faithful collation of the various readings of the two editions; but the &s;pace and pre&s;s-work required even by the following &s;pecimen and the nece&s;&s;ity I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf under of going through them a &s;econd time, which no one
<PB N="10" REF="21">needs to be told is a word of time and patience, will be a &s;ufficient apology for not having carryed it into effect at pre&s;ent. However, as Mr. Malone has pre&s;erved all the <HI>errors</HI> of the &s;econd folio, and I &s;hall exhibit a con&s;iderable number, at lea&s;t, of its <HI>emendations,</HI> the reader will, between us, have a to|lerably complete view of the controver&s;y. The fir&s;t reading is that of the folio 1623, the other that of the folio 1632.</P>

<P>"The Quip Mode&s;t, &amp;c."</P>
<P>&lindx; "THE author of this pamphlet, after a few copies had got abroad, had the <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> to &s;uppre&s;s it. Some time afterwards, repenting as it were of his repentance, he i&s;&s;ued it out. One in&s;tance may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew his <HI>profound ignorance</HI> of the poet whom he attempted to illu&s;trate; he &s;uppo&s;ed the words <HI>ignomy</HI> and <HI>intergatory,</HI> in a late edition of Shak&s;peare, to be errours of the pre&s;s! So, when the clown in <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI> &s;ays "there were but two &s;tew'd prunes in the hou&s;e, which at that very <HI>di&s;tant</HI> time &s;tood, as it were in a fruit-di&s;h, &amp;c. this Remarker for <HI>di&s;tant</HI> would read <HI>in&s;tant.</HI>"</P>
<P>The veracity of this note is no le&s;s remarkable than its decency. That the author of the pamphlet in que&s;tion ever "had the mode&s;ty to &s;uppre&s;s it" is an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood, known to his printer, his book&s;eller, and all who bought it. The truth is that, "after a few copies were got abroad," the further &s;ale was delayed till a leaf could be reprinted, in which &s;ome erroneous references had been detected, and an expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed which was thought too &s;trong for the per&s;on alluded to, even if that per&s;on had been Mr. Malone, and another added to convict the
<PB N="28" REF="39">editor or revi&s;er of the "late edition" of a gro&s;s and wilful mi&s;repre&s;entation. All this might take up a week, when the publication was continued. As to the re&s;t, both Mr. Malone and the author of that pamphlet may have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to wi&s;h that neither of them had ever betrayed more <HI>profound ig|norance</HI> of this great poet than in barely prefering the reading of one edition to that of another. That <HI>ignominy,</HI> the correction of the &s;econd folio, and of which <HI>ignomy</HI> is every where either a contraction or a corruption, is requi&s;ite in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance will be evident to all, except Mr. Malone, and perhaps the editor (or revi&s;er) of the edition in que&s;tion, from the line it&s;elf:
<Q><HI>"Ign&ograve;miny</HI> in ran&s;om and free pardon."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Intergatories,</HI> is likewi&s;e nothing more than a contraction of <HI>interrogatories,</HI> as Shak&s;peare would always have written it, if his metre had not required the &s;acrifice of a &s;yllable, which pro&s;e does not. So, in <HI>K. John:</HI>
<Q>"What earthly name to <HI>interr&ograve;gatories.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><HI>In&s;tant</HI> is al&s;o the reading of the &s;econd folio, and of every other edition before that of 1785. As however it was thought <HI>di&s;tant</HI> might be intentional, the in&s;tance was omitted in the cancel.</P>
<P>After all, if the <HI>"Quip&s;ters ignorance"</HI> of his author was &s;o <HI>"profound,"</HI> why has this infallible
<PB N="29" REF="40">judge adopted any of his remarks or &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;ometimes word for word, and el&s;ewhere with <HI>&s;neak|ing approbation,</HI> or at &s;econd-hand.

<P>"THIS piece," Mr. Malone ob&s;erves, "&s;hould &s;eem to have been written by the tinker in <HI>The Taming of the Shrew,</HI> who talks of <HI>Richard Con|queror."</HI> Unfortunately, however, the ob&s;ervation is but one out of many in&s;tances of our "half-in|formed" editors plea&s;antry being occa&s;ioned by his ignorance. He &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Richard</HI> a blunder for <HI>Ed|ward;</HI> becau&s;e he does not know that there is &s;uch a per&s;onage as <HI>Richard the Confe&s;&s;or;</HI> whereas there are no le&s;s than <HI>four Confe&s;&s;ors of that name,</HI> any of whom might have been, and one certainly was, the hero of the above play. In the fir&s;t place there is &s;aint <HI>Richard the Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> an imaginary king of England, &s;uppo&s;ed to be buried at Lucca, where he is &s;aid to have dyed on his return from a pilgrimage to Rome. Another was bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter; a
<PB N="30" REF="41">third of St. Andrews in Calabri; and the fourth hermit of Hampole near Donca&s;ter, who&s;e &s;omni|ferous lucubrations have contributed in no &s;mall de|gree to the bulk of Mr. Wartons <HI>Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry.</HI> All of the&s;e are expre&s;sly &s;tiled <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors</HI> in the <HI>Engli&s;h Martyrologe,</HI> 1608, and other books of the &s;ame ca&s;t: &s;o that the editors "attempt at jocularity" is as "feeble" as his "ignorance" is "profound."</P>

<L>To every eye-ball el&s;e.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The elder folio regulates the pa&s;&s;age thus:
<Q><L>Go make thy&s;elf like a nymph o'th' &s;ea:</L>
<L>Be &s;ubject to no &s;ight but thine and mine; invi&s;ible</L>
<L>To every eye-ball el&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;econd reads:
<Q>&mdash;like <HI>to</HI> nymph o'th' &s;ea.</Q></P>
<P>And now comes our Iri&s;h editor, and pronounces as po&s;itively as if he had been at the copyi&s;ts or compo&s;itors elbow that the words <HI>be &s;ubject</HI> were transfered to the &s;econd line "by the carele&s;sne&s;s of
<PB N="31" REF="42">the tran&s;criber or printer." "The regulation that <HI>I</HI> have made," &s;ays he, "&s;hews that the addition [of the &s;econd folio] was unnece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>The only difference between the editor of the &s;econd folio and Mr. Malone is that the former per|fected the metre of the only defective line, and the latter has de&s;troyed that of each. Had this "very fond and &s;kill-le&s;s" editor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one thou&s;andth part of the &s;en&s;e and &s;agacity he a&s;&s;umes the credit of, he would have perceived that the blunder of the tran&s;criber or printer con&s;i&s;ted, not in tran&s;po&s;ing the words <HI>be &s;ubject,</HI> but, in the in&s;ertion of two other &s;yllables which certainly have no bu&s;ine&s;s there, and could not po&s;&s;ibly have come from Shak&s;peare, unle&s;s Shak&s;peare had written like Mr. Malone. "The regulation that <HI>I</HI> have made &s;hews that the addition was nece&s;&s;ary:" I appeal to tho&s;e who have ears:
<Q><L>Go make thy&s;elf like to a nymph o'th' &s;ea,</L>
<L>Be &s;ubject to no &s;ight but mine, invi&s;ible</L>

<Q>If a Chri&s;tian <HI>do</HI> not play the knave, and get thee, I am much deceived.</Q>
<P>"If a Chri&s;tian (&s;ays Launcelot, on receiving a love-letter for Lorenzo,) do not play the knave, and carry thee away from thy fathers hou&s;e, I am much deceived." Such is the ingenious editors explana|tion, which he "would not have attempted of &s;o ea&s;y a pa&s;&s;age, if the ignorant editor of the &s;econd folio, thinking probably that the word <HI>get</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily mean <HI>beget,</HI> had not altered the text, and &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>did</HI> in the place of <HI>do,</HI> in which he has been copied by every &s;ub&s;equent editor." Every &s;ub&s;equent edi|tor mu&s;t therefor be, at lea&s;t, equally ignorant; and I dare &s;ay, if Mr. Malone is to be the judge, there never was editor, commentator or critic of Shak|&s;peare who had a grain of &s;en&s;e be&s;ide him&s;elf. A
<PB N="48" REF="59">refutation cannot be expected of &s;uch peculiar ab&s;ur|dity. "Launcelot," he &s;ays, "is not talking about Je&s;&s;ica's father, but about her future hu&s;band." But how does he know this? who told him &s;o? can he be better acquainted with the &s;ubject of Launcelots conver&s;ation than the man him&s;elf? He is aware, at the &s;ame time, that, in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;cene, he &s;ays to Je&s;&s;ica, "Marry, you may partly hope your <HI>father got you not;</HI>" but he is now, it &s;eems, on another &s;ub|ject. That, however, is but the idle opinion of Mr. Malone; the editor of the &s;econd folio, and all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and, I will venture to add, Shak&s;peare him&s;elf, and all his readers, think very differently.</P>

a reading which is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;en&s;e and mea&s;ure of the ver&s;e, and which one may therefor reckon in|di&s;putably Shak&s;peares. The pre&s;ent editor, how|ever, who is in fact, what he would have the other thought to be, "utterly ignorant of our authors phra|&s;eology and metre," omits the article, under pre|tence that "<HI>Country</HI> is here u&s;ed as a <HI>tri&s;yllable.</HI>" To rea&s;on with a man who has no more ear for poetry than Dr. John&s;on had for mu&s;ic, and he &s;carcely "knew a <HI>drum</HI> from a <HI>trumpet,</HI> or a <HI>bag|pipe</HI> from a <HI>guitar,</HI>" would be ab&s;urd: every other per&s;on will &s;ee it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for Shak|&s;peare to write &s;uch a line as this, or indeed for any one but Mr. Malone to conceive it:

<Q>Over the wretched? What though you have <HI>mo</HI> beauty.</Q>
<P>The old copies reading&mdash;no <HI>beauty,</HI> the editor
<PB N="52" REF="63">will have it to be a mi&s;print for <HI>mo,</HI> or <HI>more,</HI> as he has every where el&s;e thought proper to write it. This, he &s;ays, "appears clearly from the pa&s;&s;age in Lodge's <HI>Ro&s;alynde,</HI> which Shak&s;peare has here imi|tated:&mdash;"Becau&s;e <HI>thou art beautiful,</HI> be not &s;o coy, &amp;c." A pa&s;&s;age which, as it contains neither <HI>no</HI> nor <HI>mo,</HI> can not certainly prove what it is brought to do. The con&s;truction adopted by this pene|trating critic is that though a <HI>woman</HI> has <HI>more</HI> beauty than her <HI>lover</HI> &s;he is not on that account to in&s;ult him: an idea which one can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e never entered into any head but his own; one would not, therefor, wi&s;h to deprive the pre&s;ent edition of an emendation &s;o worthy of it. But, however, Mr. Malone may read, his author certainly wrote
<Q>Over the wretched? what though you have beauty.</Q>
He could not perceive that <HI>no</HI> or <HI>mo</HI> was as injurious to the metre, as his quotation from Lodge might have led him to &s;u&s;pect it was to the &s;en&s;e: though I believe he under&s;tands both equally well.

<P>Mr. Malone, no doubt, is able to perceive a great many thing which neither Mr. Pope nor any body el&s;e would dream of; though, if Mr. Pope did not perceive that a <HI>word of four &s;yllables</HI> was a <HI>word of four &s;yllables,</HI> he mu&s;t have been a more extraordi|nary per&s;on than he is generally reputed.

<P>Dr. John&s;on, having ob&s;erved that the improba|bility of this &s;cene is &s;carcely balanced by the hu|mour, our Iri&s;h editor perceives no improbability: a&s;&s;erting roundly that Fal&s;taff does NOT mi&s;take the prince for a ba&s;tard of the kings, but means to in|form him at once that he knows him a Poins, not|with&s;tanding their di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>The text, which is too plain to be mi&s;under&s;tood by a reader of common &s;en&s;e, will &s;peak for it&s;elf, and clearly prove that neither Fal&s;taff nor the ho&s;te&s;s knows the prince till he &s;ays he is "come to draw him out by the ears." Fal&s;taff him&s;elf allows that he did not know the prince was within hearing: but this per&s;picacious critic, who can &s;ee into the mid&s;t of a mill&s;tone, would be thought to know what pa&s;&s;es better than either Fal&s;taff, or Fal&s;taffs creator.</P>

<Q><STAGE>Enter Mortimer.</STAGE></Q>
<P>Mr. Steevens, from the MS. notes of Mr. Ed|wards,
<PB N="68" REF="79">having ob&s;erved "that Shak&s;peare has varied from the truth of hi&s;tory, to introduce this &s;cene be|tween Mortimer and Richard Plantagenet," "a half-informed <HI>Remarker</HI> on this note" (they are the words of the gentle Edmond) "&s;eems to think that he has totally over-turned it, by quoting the following pa&s;|&s;age from Hall's <HI>Chronicle:</HI> "During which par|liament [held in the third year of Henry VI. 1425.] came to London Peter Duke of Quimber,&mdash;which of the Duke of Exeter, &amp;c. was highly fe&s;ted.&mdash;Du|ring which &s;ea&s;on Edmond Mortymer, the la&s;t Erle of Marche of that name, (whiche long tyme had bene re&s;trayned from hys liberty and finally waxed lame) di&s;cea&s;ed without y&s;&s;ue, who&s;e inheritance de&s;cended to Lord Richard Plantagenet," &amp;c. as if a circum&s;tance which Hall has mentioned to mark the <HI>time</HI> of Mortimer's death, nece&s;&s;arily a&s;certained the <HI>place</HI> where it happened al&s;o. The fact is, that this Edmund Mortimer did <HI>not</HI> die in London, but at Trim in Ireland." So far, &s;o good.</P>
<P>This te&s;ty critic &s;eems to &s;mart &s;o much from &s;ome corrections of that &s;ame "half-informed <HI>Re|marker,</HI>" that he may be readily allowed to avail him|&s;elf of every opportunity of abu&s;ing him, particularly where he happens to anticipate a quotation which an all-informed editor would have been glad to produce. The pa&s;&s;age in Hall (and it is copyed by Hollin&s;hed) would be &s;ufficient, it was &s;aid, to ju&s;tify Shak&s;peare "even if the fact were otherwi&s;e;" and
<PB N="69" REF="80">&s;o it undoubtedly is, notwith&s;tanding either the great learning or little &s;currility of Edmond Malone. The hi&s;torian does not, to be &s;ure, expre&s;sly &s;ay that the Earl of March dyed in the <HI>Tower;</HI> but no per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e can think that he meant to relate an event which happened to a <HI>&s;ound, free man</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as happening to a <HI>lame pri&s;oner</HI> during the time a particular per&s;on was fea&s;ting in <HI>London.</HI> In fact, he <HI>does</HI> &s;ay that this nobleman <HI>dyed in pri&s;on,</HI> and that by &s;uch pri&s;on he meant either the <HI>Tower,</HI> or &s;ome place of confinement at no great di&s;tance, is almo&s;t certain, not only from the circum&s;tance already mentioned, but from a pa&s;&s;age in the pre|ceding part of his book, where he expre&s;sly tells us that "the Erle of Marche was euer <HI>kepte in the courte</HI> vnder &s;uch a keper that he could nether doo or attempte any thyng agayn&s;te the king without his knowledge, and dyed without i&s;&s;ue." If he did not mean the <HI>Tower,</HI> let Mr. Malone &s;ay what pri&s;on he did mean. To what purpo&s;e is it that the actual truth was otherwi&s;e? Our author had neither <HI>Ry|mer,</HI> nor <HI>Dugdale,</HI> nor <HI>Sandford,</HI> to con&s;ult, and it cannot &s;urely be expected that he &s;hould have gone to examine the record office: He naturally took for fact what he found in <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and if the hi&s;torian were but <HI>half-informed,</HI> how could he help it? He was writing a play, not a chronicle. I know, much better, I am per&s;uaded, than Mr. Malone, how little either Hall or Hollin&s;hed is to be depended on in
<PB N="70" REF="81">matter of fact. Is the death of Edmond Mortimer of greater con&s;equence than the intended marriage of lady Bona, or the capture, impri&s;onment and e&s;cape of K. Edward IV. both which are ab&s;olutely fabulous and without the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;&s;ible founda|tion. And why is not Shak&s;peare, who has adopted the&s;e two lying &s;tories, charged with having in the&s;e in&s;tances "varyed from the truth of hi&s;tory?" The remark was natural enough to Mr. Edwards, who did not know what &s;ort of hi&s;tories our author con|&s;ulted; neither indeed is the editors defence of it otherwi&s;e, being a pedantic parade of hi&s;torical knowledge picked up for the occa&s;ion, to fa&s;ten Shak&s;peare with a charge which every one mu&s;t think frivolous, and which he knew to be unju&s;t.</P>

<P>A little &s;uperficial reading, and a con&s;ummate &s;tock of a&s;&s;urance authori&s;e this hypercritical com|mentator to abu&s;e what he does not under&s;tand. The "anonymous Remarker," confidently if it mu&s;t be, a&s;&s;erts that the &s;cene in que&s;tion, in which Ed|ward and Richard per&s;uade their father to break his oath, had no foundation in hi&s;tory; and gives this rea&s;on for it, that, "neither the Earl of March nor Richard was then at Sandal; the latter being like|wi&s;e a mere child, &s;carcely more than (if indeed &s;o much as) nine years old:" in fact he was but ju&s;t turned of eight. How, therefor, does the Iri&s;h edi|tor, with all his pitiful caviling and malignity, pick out from the&s;e words that York had never taken an oath? And, though he and Warwick did leave Lon|don
<PB N="73" REF="84">with 5 or 6,000 men, and might &s;end a me&s;&s;age to his &s;on to follow them, it was with the kings own authority, to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: nor could either his attack|ing, or his defending him&s;elf again&s;t, the queen or prince be any breach of his oath. So that the Re|markers a&s;&s;ertion, however confident, is &s;trictly true; which is more than this ingenuous Hibernian can always &s;ay of his own, which are at the &s;ame time very &s;eldom di&s;tingui&s;hable by diffidence.</P>
<P>It is not true that the queen and prince were at York, nor do we find from any good authority that they were &s;ent to by the King. Though, if they had been &s;ent to, and, in&s;tead of obeying the requi&s;ition, had employed them&s;elves in rai&s;ing a rebellion, it would have been perfectly con&s;onant with the dukes oath and duty to have prevented or quelled it. But in fact, whatever concern the queen might have in the York&s;hire in&s;urrection, &s;he did not return from Scotland till after the battle of Wakefield.</P>
<P>What &s;ort of hi&s;tories the Iri&s;h editor con&s;ults I am at a lo&s;s to imagine; and as he does not choo&s;e to cite them, I &s;hall for once follow his example.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I collect from another note (p. 321) where he &s;ays that "neither of his daughters was married at the time when Warwick was in France negotiating a marriage between lady Bona and the king," that the learned gentleman is content either with the &s;ame hi&s;torians whom Shak&s;peare u&s;ed, or with tho&s;e who have followed them: Warwick <HI>never</HI> was in France for any &s;uch purpo&s;e: as no one but &s;uch a "half-informed" note-writer can be ignorant.</NOTE></P>

<P>The <HI>Remark</HI> is: "Your ma&s;ter, it &s;eems, had more confidence in lord Timon than mine, other|wi&s;e, his (<HI>i. e.</HI> my ma&s;ters) debt (<HI>i. e.</HI> the &s;um due to him from Timon) would, certainly, have been as great as your ma&s;ter (<HI>i. e.</HI> as the money which Timon owes
<PB N="92" REF="103">to your ma&s;ter); that is, my ma&s;ter, being as rich as yours, could and would have advanced Timon as large a &s;um as your ma&s;ter has advanced him, if he (<HI>i. e.</HI> my ma&s;ter) had thought it prudent to do &s;o."</P>
<P>Very well: now comes "the true explication," which the editor &s;ays he "al&s;o formerly propo&s;ed;" an a&s;&s;ertion, if he mean in the edition of 1778, which is evidently untrue. The reader may com|pare them.</P>
<P>"<HI>His</HI> may refer to <HI>mine.</HI> "It &s;hould &s;eem that the confidential friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between your ma&s;ter and Timon was greater than that &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Timon and my ma&s;ter; el&s;e &s;urely <HI>his</HI> &s;um, i. e. the &s;um <HI>borrowed</HI> from <HI>my</HI> ma&s;ter, [the la&s;t antecedent] had been as large as the &s;um <HI>borrowed</HI> from yours."</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be perfectly clear, that the Remarker could not be indebted to a note which, &s;o far as it is intelligible, &s;eems diametrically oppo&s;ite to his idea. It is equally &s;o, that the editor has availed him&s;elf of the above "&s;hallow" Remark, to vary the expre&s;|&s;ion of his "&s;ee-&s;aw conjecture," and give it a &s;en&s;e it would otherwi&s;e never have had.

<P>On this difficult pa&s;&s;age our editor had one con|jecture which had luckily, it &s;eems, e&s;caped him when the play was printing, but he unfortunately recollected it in time for his appendix. It is that the word <HI>table</HI> is right, and the corrupted word <HI>and,</HI> which may have been mi&s;printed for <HI>in;</HI> and thus then the pa&s;&s;age will mean&mdash;"and his note was as &s;harp as a <HI>pen</HI> in a <HI>table</HI> of green fields." A <HI>pen</HI> may have been u&s;ed for a <HI>pin-fold,</HI> and a table for a picture. The pointed &s;takes, he adds, of which pinfolds are &s;ometimes formed were perhaps in the poets thoughts.</P>
<P><HI>Ri&s;um teneatis?</HI> If Shak&s;peare had had the pointed &s;takes of a pinfold in his minds eye he would have mentioned it, for though the <HI>&s;take</HI> may be &s;harp, the <HI>pinfold</HI> is not. But why wa&s;te a moment in the

<P>Such are the ob&s;ervations which I have had to make upon this mo&s;t &s;agacious of editors, and his unparalleled edition.
