<P>THE information was opened by Mr. Percival, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>This is an Information again&s;t THOMAS PAINE, for that he, being a per&s;on of a wicked, malicious, and &s;editious di&s;po&s;ition; and wi&s;hing to introduce di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and to cau&s;e it to be be|lieved, that the Crown of this kingdom was con|trary to the rights of the inhabitants of this king|dom;
<PB N="2" REF="3">and to cau&s;e it to be believed al&s;o, that the Bill of Rights was a Bill of Wrongs and In&s;ults; all tending to bring the government of this country into contempt, and endeavouring to cau&s;e it to be believed that the Parliament of this country was openly corrupt in the face of day; and in order to withdraw the affection of the people of this king|dom, again&s;t the law and con&s;titution of this country, he the &s;aid THOMAS PAINE, wi&s;hing and intending this mi&s;chief, did, on the 16th of Fe|bruary 1791, wickedly, fal&s;ely, maliciou&s;ly, &s;can|dalou&s;ly, and &s;editiou&s;ly publi&s;h a certain book, called "Second Part of Rights of Man," &s;igned THOMAS PAINE, containing many fal&s;e, wicked, &s;candalous, malicious, and &s;editious a&s;&s;ertions; with which I will not trouble you, as you will have them from the ATTORNEY GENERAL. The Defendant has pleaded, Not Guilty; upon which i&s;&s;ue is joined.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e was then opened by Mr. Attorney Ge|neral, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>Will you permit me to &s;olicit your attention to this cau&s;e for no long portion of time, in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of this bu&s;ine&s;s; for, Gentlemen, this ca&s;e, in my humble judgment, is a plain, a clear, a &s;hort, and an indisputable ca&s;e; were it not, Gentlemen that certain circum&s;tances have rendered it a ca&s;e of more expectation than ordinary, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould have literally contented my&s;elf this day with conducting it my&s;elf, as I did in another ca&s;e that
<PB N="3" REF="4">occurred very lately, namely, by &s;imply reading the pa&s;&s;ages I have &s;elected, and then leaving them for your judgment; but it &s;o happens, that the ac|cumulated mi&s;chief, which has ari&s;en from the ca&s;e before you, and the con&s;equences that have followed from this publication, have rendered it nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, that I &s;hould &s;ay a few words more in the opening than would otherwi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary. In the fir&s;t place, you will permit me, I hope, without the impu|tation of &s;peaking of my&s;elf, who am a very trifling &s;ubject, always di&s;gu&s;ting to others, to &s;ay, that this pro&s;ecution does corre&s;pond with my private judg|ment; for it has been &s;aid, and the rumour has met my ears from every quarter, that I did di&s;approve of this pro&s;ecution; the refutation I &s;hall give to that is this, that I &s;hould think I de&s;erved to be ex|pelled with di&s;grace from the &s;ituation his Maje&s;ty has honoured me with in his &s;ervice, and that of my fellow-&s;ubjects, if I had he&s;itated to bring this enormous offender, as I con&s;ider him, before a Jury of his country. Gentlemen, the publication in que&s;tion was not the fir&s;t of the kind which this de|fendant &s;ent forth into the world. This publication was preceded by another; that publication, although it was &s;uch as I was not entirely warranted in over|looking, yet I did overlook it, on this principle, that the pro&s;ecutor &s;hould not be &s;harp in his pro|&s;ecution, though he is to be in&s;trumental in pre|venting any manner of improper publication com|ing before the public eye. Reprehen&s;ible as that book was, it was u&s;hered into the world under cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="4" REF="5">that led me to believe that it would not confound the judicious reader; and then &s;uch a man would refute it as he went along: But when I found that another publication was u&s;hered into the world, that in all &s;hapes was, with an indu&s;try in|conceivable, circulated, either per&s;onally or locally, and was thru&s;t into the hands of parties of all de|&s;criptions, that even children's &s;weetmeats were wrapped up with portions of it, and all the in|du&s;try, &s;uch as I de&s;cribed, to obtrude and force it on that part of the public who cannot correct as they go along; I thought it behoved me, on the earlie&s;t po&s;&s;ible occa&s;ion, to put a charge on re|cord again&s;t the author of that book: Now, Gen|tlemen, permit me to &s;tate to you, what it is that I impute to this book, and what it is that I inten|tionally impute to this book; I mean the intention of the writer of the book. Gentlemen, try it by every thing which the human mind can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;ee if you are not &s;atisfied, in the long-run, that it does de&s;erve that de&s;cription which my duty obliges me to give it. Gentlemen, in the fir&s;t place, I impute to it a deliberate intention to vilify and degrade, and thereby to bring into abhorrence and contempt, the whole con&s;titution of the govern|ment of this country, not as e&s;tabli&s;hed, that I will never admit, but as explained and re&s;tored, at the Re|volution; that &s;y&s;tem of government, which we this day look at; and which, if by contemptuous ex|pre&s;&s;ions, or by declamatory propo&s;itions ready made, men may be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, and im|po&s;ed upon to their own de&s;truction, who might
<PB REF="6">be thought to have experience enough to receive that which is their &s;alvation, and which goes all this way which I impute to this book, a deliberate de&s;ign to eradicate from the minds of the people of this country that enthu&s;ia&s;tic love which they have for the con&s;titution of this country, which is the greate&s;t human mi&s;chief that can be done in &s;ociety. Gentlemen, further I impute, that in terms the regal part of the government of this country, founded and limited as it is, is repre&s;ented as op|pre&s;&s;ive and abominable tyranny; thirdly, that the whole legi&s;lature of this country is directly an u&s;urpation; again, that with re&s;pect to the laws of this realm, which hitherto have been our boa&s;t, of the&s;e, without one &s;ingle exception, that they are grounded on an u&s;urped authority, and are, therefore, null, or, to u&s;e his own terms, that there is little or no law in the country; then it is to be held out in the lower, or better informed cla&s;&s;es of ten or twelve millions of people, that there is nothing binding on their conduct, excepting &s;uch a portion of religion or morality as they may wi&s;h to entertain. Gentlemen, are we then a lawle&s;s banditti? Are every man's arms unbound? Are we reduced back again to that &s;avage &s;tate of nature? I a&s;k you that que&s;tion: You know well the an&s;wer. But what will you &s;ay to the man who holds this out to tho&s;e who cannot give the an&s;wer you give? You can an|&s;wer to this &s;lander on the con&s;titution, this &s;lander on the &s;eparate parts of the government, &s;o con&s;ti|tuted
<PB N="6" REF="7">as ours is; then, that &s;weeping imputation on the whole &s;y&s;tem of law that binds it together, name|ly, that it is a null and void &s;y&s;tem in the &s;everal principal circum&s;tances I &s;elect to you; and make this ob&s;ervation, that by &s;electing tho&s;e which I ob|&s;erve to be dangerous, I do not do it in order to create a di&s;gu&s;t, neither more nor le&s;s than this, in &s;tating all the objections that can be to monarchy, to pure and &s;imple ari&s;tocracy, never &s;aying a word to tho&s;e as combined with democracy, that wor&s;t of all governments&mdash;unbalanced democracy, which is nece&s;&s;arily connected with democratical tyranny. Gentlemen, to whom are the&s;e poi&s;ons that are con|veyed in this book addre&s;&s;ed? They are addre&s;&s;ed, Gentlemen, to the ignorant, to the credulous, to the de&s;perate; and to tho&s;e per&s;ons who are de&s;perate all government is irk&s;ome, nothing can be &s;o pala|table to their ears as the comfortable doctrine, that there is no law: They are an ea&s;y prey to the crafty, who have the cruelty to deceive. Gentlemen, in judging of the malignant nature which I from my foul impute to this author, you will be plea&s;ed to take into your con&s;ideration, the phra&s;e, the manner, and the matter: The phra&s;e I &s;tate to be in&s;idious and artful, the manner of the phra&s;e, in many in&s;tances, deceiving and contemptuous,&mdash; a &s;hort argument, only a flippant one, with the ignorant and credulous. With re&s;pect to the matter, in my con&s;cience I call it trea&s;on, though technical|ly, according to the laws of the country, it is not;
<PB N="7" REF="8">for, Gentlemen, if we balance the influence of &s;ociety to that which is technically trea&s;on, in this coun|try we mu&s;t not extend it; con&s;ider the danger between doctrines and in&s;inuations of this &s;ort, and that which may happen from any trea&s;on whatever, even the compa&s;&s;ing the death of the Prince on the throne. The law has found a means of e&s;caping that calamity, which, perhaps, on looking back, we might very ea&s;ily recollect; but even in compari&s;on with this, the cha&s;m is filled up by the con&s;titution of this country; and where is that power upon earth that can fill up the cha&s;m in the con&s;titution that has been growing, not for 700 years, but from times eternal, as hi&s;tory tells? us that has been growing from the time pa&s;t, from that day up to this, until it was con&s;ummated by a revolu|tion which &s;hone forth in all its &s;plendour. Gen|tlemen, even to impute to the exi&s;tence of this con|&s;titution the very evils in&s;eparable from human &s;o|ciety, or even from human nature it&s;elf, all the&s;e are imputed to that &s;candalous and wicked, that u&s;urped con&s;titution under which we, the &s;ubjects of this country, have hitherto conceived our&s;elves happy to live. Gentlemen, I conceive it to be no difficult operation of the human mind to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the law under which we live, and to draw men's minds from that con&s;titution; it is the operation of good &s;en&s;e, and it is not difficult for a Jury of the City of London. Gentlemen, you will ob&s;erve whether the whole of this book, that is,
<PB N="8" REF="9">&s;o much of it as I am at liberty to trouble you with, is not of this de&s;cription, that it is by no means cal|culated to di&s;cu&s;s and convince, but to inflame; not to rea&s;on, but to dictate, and, Gentlemen, to dictate in &s;uch a manner and in &s;uch phra&s;e, as in all &s;uch circum&s;tances it cannot, in my humble ap|prehen&s;ion, leave the mo&s;t remote doubt in your mind of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the heart of that man who printed this book in this country. Gentlemen, permit me now to &s;ay a word or two on tho&s;e pa&s;&s;a|ges I have &s;elected to you, fir&s;t de&s;cribing what tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are. I have thought it much more becoming, and beneficial to the public, than any other cour&s;e I could take, to &s;elect &s;ix or &s;even, and no more, not wi&s;hing to load the record un|nece&s;&s;arily. The fir&s;t of them you will find in page 21, where you will find this doctrine:</P>
<Q>All hereditary government is in its nature ty|ranny. An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation, than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds!</Q>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, what is the tendency of this pa&s;&s;age? All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny: So there is no juri&s;diction whatever, not even the &s;ubordination of the country; the regal office being neither more nor le&s;s than this, &s;tating it roundly, that in all circum|&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="10">whatever, hereditary government mu&s;t in its nature be tyranny. But is it to be held out to the people of this government, that they are &s;laves? Now, Gentlemen, there is one of tho&s;e ready-made propo&s;itions, that are crammed down the throats of the people of this country: The ca&s;e is &s;uch, that I am bound intolerably, and I can bear it no longer. Then, Gentlemen, an heritable crown&mdash;our's is an heritable crown, or under whatever name, that which we are accu&s;tomed to look to, namely, the whole body of the country, it is no other than that men are heritable property; and to inherit a government, is to inherit people, as flocks and herds. It is to be told, without further ceremony, that they are inherited by a king of this country; and you will judge whether that does not hold out this doctrine. The conver&s;e is directly the ca&s;e: The king of this country inherits an office under the law&mdash;he inherits no per&s;ons; we are not in a &s;tate of villanage; he inherits the office&mdash; but as to any other inheritance, none el&s;e, as you very well know, belongs to him: I &s;hall not &s;tay to prove that one moment.&mdash;In page 47, &s;peaking of the Congre&s;s of Philadelphia in 1787, &s;peaking of the regal power, which, you know, under a different modification, prevails in that country,</P>
<P>"This convention," he &s;ays, <Q>met at Philadel|phia, in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hing|ton was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time connected with any of the &s;tate govern|ments,
<PB N="10" REF="11">or with Congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The convention went deeply into all the &s;ub|jects; and having, after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal con&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was the manner of giving it authority and practice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this purpo&s;e they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector, but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, what is the con&s;equence of that? Is it hi&s;toric? I &s;hould have thought that a man, meaning nothing but hi&s;tory, would have been very well contented to recite only hi&s;tory; not in tho&s;e inflammable and contemptible words, <Q>For this purpo&s;e they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q> Here the Revolution, and the force and &s;en&s;e of the nation, &s;tare us in the face; it was nothing more than a mere cabal of courtiers. But to &s;hew how totally unnece&s;&s;ary this pa&s;&s;age was, except for the delibe|rate purpo&s;e of contempt, I will ju&s;t read three or four lines, to &s;hew how it would operate; the pa&s;|&s;age beyond that which is called a cabal, is this:</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"><Q>They fir&s;t directed, that the propo&s;ed con&s;titu|tion &s;hould be publi&s;hed. Secondly, that each &s;tate &s;hould elect a convention, expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e of taking it into con&s;ideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it; and that as &s;oon as the approbation and ratification of any nine &s;tates &s;hould be given, that tho&s;e &s;tares &s;hould proceed to the election of their proportion of members to the new federal government; and that the opera|tion of it &s;hould then begin, and the former federal government cea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>This is nothing more than a narration of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the convention: Does not this pa&s;&s;age &s;tand in&s;ulated between the two pa&s;&s;ages of hi&s;tory, thru&s;t in for the purpo&s;es of mi&s;chief? The different wicked pa&s;&s;ages that are meant to do mi&s;chief, are &s;pread throughout, and &s;tuck in here and there; and it is pretty frequently nece&s;&s;ary to have a recol|lection of the preceding pa&s;&s;ages, for the pa&s;&s;ages very manife&s;tly &s;hew the whole: And if any one will compare the pa&s;&s;ages together, he will &s;ee that mi&s;|chief come out, more than by one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age. The next is in page 52; he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this manner:</P>
<P><Q>The hi&s;tory of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, ex|hibits as many in&s;tances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had re&s;tricted it. The Stuarts endeavoured to pa&s;s to &s;e limits, and their fate is well known. In all
<PB N="12" REF="13">tho&s;e in&s;tances we &s;ee nothing of a con&s;titution, but only of re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power.</Q></P>
<P>Then, Gentlemen, from the reign of the Edwards and the Henries, it was a regular progre&s;&s;ion of tyranny; not of liberty, till the Stuarts &s;tepped a little beyond the line, and that begot a nece&s;&s;ity for a revi&s;ion. But the Edwards&mdash;I &s;hould have thought he might have &s;pared the great founder of our con&s;titution, Edward the Third; but in&s;tead of that, Gentlemen, this author would have the people of this country believe, that up to that time it was a progre&s;&s;ive tyranny; and that there was &s;ome one material re&s;triction, &s;ome a&s;&s;umed power, and that in &s;ome degree it retarded the progre&s;s of that &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of tyranny. In &s;hort, he &s;ays</P>
<Q><P>After this, another William, de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and claiming from the &s;ame origin, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and of the two evils, James and William, the nation preferred what it thought the lea&s;t, &s;ince from circum&s;tances it mu&s;t take one. The act called the Bill of Rights comes here into view. What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other, to divide power, profits, and privileges? You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I will have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the nation, it is &s;aid, For your &s;hare, you &s;hall have the right of petitioning. This being the ca&s;e, the Bill of Rights is more properly a bill of wrongs and of in&s;ult. As to
<PB N="13" REF="14">what is called the convention parliament&mdash;it was a thing that made it&s;elf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few per&s;ons got together, and called them&s;elves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From the time of William, a &s;pecies of govern|ment aro&s;e, i&s;&s;uing out of this coalition Bill of rights; and more &s;o, &s;ince the corruption intro|duced at the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the agency of Walpole, that can be de&s;cribed by no other name than a de&s;potic legi&s;lation.</P></Q>
<P>This is the de&s;cription that this Gentleman holds out, of that on which re&s;t the property, the lives, the liberties, and the privileges of the people of this country. I wonder to God, Gentlemen, that any Briti&s;h man&mdash;for &s;uch this man certainly was, and &s;till is; to u&s;e the words of our own poet&mdash;that when he penned tho&s;e words, or wrote tho&s;e words, that they did not &s;tick in his throat! I will read this Bill of Rights: I will make no comment upon it, becau&s;e your own heads and hearts will make that comment. Gentlemen, you are the po&s;terity that are to be found in this country; are you not to take care that tho&s;e rights &s;hall be &s;ecured in this country? They are a tru&s;t in your hands: You, as a Jury, are the guardians of this Bill of Rights; which, Gentle|men, we all know, alludes to the &s;even bi&s;hops, and to the &s;candalous and gro&s;s per&s;ecution laid
<PB N="14" REF="15">on their per&s;ons. And it &s;ays, <Q>All and &s;ingular the rights and liberties allowed and claimed in this de|claration.</Q> <HI>(See Bill of Rights.)</HI> such, Gentlemen, is the bill of wrongs and in&s;ults, as Mr. Paine calls it; I &s;hall not profane it, by &s;aying one word of it.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, I a&s;k you whether what is &s;aid by this gentleman, be rea&s;oning or &s;ugge&s;tion; or whether it is any thing but de&s;cription, and that de&s;cription con&s;i&s;ting in abominable and crafty fal&s;ehoods. Would it not have been fair in him to have &s;aid what it was? But, un&s;ight un&s;een, this &s;uppo&s;ition is tendered to the public. Gentlemen, you will plea&s;e to make a memorandum of page 56; you will find that to be written in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and with the &s;ame de&s;ign. This gentleman proceeds in this manner: He tells you that <Q>The attention of the government of England,</Q> this is in a con|temptuous parenthe&s;is; he &s;ays, <Q>(for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name, than the Engli&s;h government) appears, &s;ince its political con|nection with Germany, to have been &s;o com|pletely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;e.</Q> (Then, that go|vernment exi&s;ts for no other purpo&s;e, than the pur|po&s;e of rai&s;ing taxes.) I only beg leave to draw your attention, Gentlemen, to the dogmatic cavalier, and contemptuous parenthe&s;is: Further, he &s;ays, <Q>Dome&s;tic concerns are neglected; and with re|&s;pect
<PB N="15" REF="16">to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to gentlemen eminent in the city of London: I think I may appeal to the growing pro&s;perity of this country, from the moment that the night-mare was taken from it, to this moment; and God &s;end it may continue to contemplate this doctrine, as applied to the &s;ubject, and I think you may &s;ee &s;ufficient cau&s;e for di&s;approbation! Gentlemen, we &s;hall now proceed to page 63, where the whole con&s;titu|tion of this country having been profaned in gro&s;s, we now proceed a little to di&s;&s;ect it: It con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;everal parts of that con&s;titution; and in page 63, in a dogma, we have this:</P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to the two hou&s;es, of which the Engli&s;h parliament is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one; and as a legi&s;la|ture is to have no temper of its own, the mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obedience.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, here is another dogma, with|out a &s;ingle argument; but that there is no govern|ment, they are dead-a&s;leep, and that you might ju&s;t as well have &s;o many pictures, &s;o many &s;tatues; and that it is not new, but from the very nature of things it mu&s;t be &s;o: It &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the hou&s;e of Lords ; and &s;o little is this nick|named hou&s;e regarded, that the people &s;carcely
<PB N="16" REF="17">enquire at any time what it is doing. It appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, this is &s;poken in this contemp|tuous manner of the ari&s;tocratical part of this coun|try; it is not for me, Gentlemen, at this time of day, to be lecturing about it:&mdash;I really will not re|peat the catechi&s;m of Engli&s;hmen. You are not &s;o ignorant of the hi&s;tory of this country, not to know the very brilliant characters there have been, and are in it, which will defend it from &s;uch &s;candalous and contemptuous &s;landers, and &s;hew whether the govern|ment is good or bad. Gentlemen, the next is page 107; there you will find two of the component parts of the legi&s;lature di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>We will come now up to the Crown it&s;elf: <Q>The Crown very truly it&s;elf &s;ignifies a nominal office of a million &s;terling a year, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ts in receiving the money. Whether the per&s;on be wife or fooli&s;h, &s;ane or in&s;ane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every mini&s;try acts upon the &s;ame idea that Mr. Burke writes, name|ly, that the people mu&s;t be hoodwinked, and held in &s;uper&s;titious ignorance by &s;ome bugbear or other, and what is called the Crown an&s;wers this purpo&s;e, and therefore it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es to be expected from it. This is more than can be &s;aid of the other two branches.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I do not offer one word upon this: but in page 108 you will find,</P>
<P><Q>This is the hazard to which this office is ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="18">in all countries; not from any thing that may happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation&mdash;the danger of its coming to its &s;en&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>We have been in&s;ane for &s;even or eight hundred years, and when an in&s;anity has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long, I tru&s;t it will become incurable. In page 116 you have the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>I happened to be in England at the celebra|tion of the centenary of the Revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have al|ways appeared to me dete&s;table, the one &s;eeking to de&s;troy his uncle, and the other her father, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power them&s;elves; yet, as the nation was di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;omething of that: event, I felt hurt at feeing it a&s;cribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job, and who, be&s;ides what he otherwi&s;e got, charged 600,000l. for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Fir&s;t ailed the &s;ame clo&s;e-fi&s;ted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, 250,000l. over and above his pay as King; and having thus purcha&s;ed it at the expence of England, added it to his Ha|noverian dominions for his own private profit.&mdash;In fact, every nation that does not govern it&s;elf, is governed as a job; England has been the prey of jobs ever &s;ince the Revolution.</Q></P>
<P>Then, Gentlemen, this is &s;omething different from
<PB N="18" REF="19">democracy and hereditacy; he conceives that fort of government, not to be the government of a people of them&s;elves; but that it is a job, and not a govern|ment.&mdash;Now, Gentlemen, &s;uch are the pa&s;&s;ages; I have &s;elected tho&s;e that bear mo&s;t on the mo&s;t of|fen&s;ive doctrines in the book,&mdash;that are &s;uch as go fundamentally to overturn the government of this country.&mdash;In page 161 it is &s;aid,</P>
<P><Q>That fraud, hypocri&s;y, and impo&s;ition of govern|ments, are now beginning to be too well under|&s;tood to promi&s;e them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, in all coun|tries, is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dre&s;&s;ing for the funeral. Let it then pa&s;s quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be comforted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for fending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brun&s;wick for men, at the expence of a million a year, who under&s;tood neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t, and who&s;e capaci|ties would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of a pari&s;h con&s;table.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, this is &s;aid of King William the Third, and of the two King Georges, and of the pre&s;ent &s;overeign on the throne.&mdash;<Q>If government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpo&s;es may be found in every town and village.</Q>&mdash;Gentlemen, you well know the policy and con&s;titution of this country has ever
<PB N="19" REF="20">avoided, excepting when driven to it by melancholy nece&s;&s;ity, to di&s;turb the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and have thought it more wife to pur&s;ue that principle.&mdash;I, Gentlemen, would a&s;k any man who hears me, in point of hi&s;tory, whether it is not the prominent effect of elective monarchy, that they very &s;eldom are men of con&s;ideration, and mo&s;t frequently of turbulent factions, after having di&s;|turbed the country?&mdash;Often has it happened, too, that when there are foreign and civil wars, they al|ways have cho&s;en very weak per&s;ons, in the hope of &s;trengthening their own party; that will be found, I believe, on examination, to be the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to elective &s;overeignties; and to have pre|vailed greatly, more than any inconvenience that may have ari&s;en from the natural forms of hereditary rights. Gentlemen, has he &s;tated with any fort of fairne&s;s? Has he at all &s;tated or adverted to the many&mdash;many re&s;ources we are acquainted with?&mdash;We know a Council of Parliament, is a Council in matters of law, and a privy Council; it is the &s;ame in point of con&s;ideration, and in point of re&s;pecta|bility, with tho&s;e which &s;uit the natural cour&s;e and infirmity of human nature, when it is con&s;idered as an office, and that the officer is not an officer of this country. Gentlemen, it has ju&s;t come acro&s;s my mind, there is unque&s;tionably one illu&s;trious excep|tion to that doctrine, of a man not the mo&s;t capable of governing, having been cho&s;en to the feat of an elec|tive monarchy, whom no misfortunes and no di&s;ap|pointments
<PB N="20" REF="21">could impair; his mind has ari&s;en with an ela&s;ticity equivalent to all the pre&s;&s;ure I have &s;tated; and he, though not a great prince, perhaps will go down to po&s;terity, not only as a man, but as a great man,&mdash;I mean the King of Poland: That il|lu&s;trious prince had the greater part of his education in this country; there he cultivated the company of every man of &s;cience; there he became acquainted with every mode of literature in this country; he became familiarized to the con&s;titution of the coun|try; there he became inflamed with the bill of wrongs and in&s;ults. From that education it is that I really believe him to have become the ju&s;t and wi&s;e prince that he has proved him&s;elf to be. Gentle|men, I will now, for want of better expre&s;&s;ion, for I pretend not to any oratory, I pretend to feeling, and to have formed my expre&s;&s;ion on this &s;ubject ac|cording to truth: If I can utter them in plain words, it will be the utmo&s;t I can do; but I will borrow from a writer who, I think, is fitte&s;t to give an an&s;wer to the defendant, Thomas Paine; that man, as I have rea&s;on to believe, does not put his name to it; he is not the chief magi&s;trate, but the &s;econd in the executive government of a country. Gen|tlemen, before I bring his words, this is my opinion of the work, and which I humbly offer to your con&s;ideration and adoption; he &s;ays his <Q>in|tention appears evidently to be to convince the people of Great Britain, that they have neither
<PB N="21" REF="22">liberty nor con&s;titution; and there is no po&s;&s;ible means to produce the&s;e effects to them&s;elves &s;o ea&s;y as that where per&s;ons governed, follow impli|citly the conduct of the French.</Q> The next pa&s;&s;age is this,&mdash;<Q>Mr. Paine cuts the Gordian knot, and at once compares parliament, &amp;c. <HI>to the words, the champion of the Revolution; (I take this to be Adams</HI>'s <HI>an&s;wer);</HI> I &s;hall therefore now pro|ceed to examine the rea&s;ons;</Q> and &s;o it goes on. Now, Gentlemen, with your permi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall adopt his words; <Q>when Mr. Paine invited the people of England, &amp;c. <HI>to the words, with which he mu&s;t be hereditary.</HI></Q>&mdash;So much for the pa&s;&s;ages and the interpretation, which I &s;ubmit, Gentlemen, humbly to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The next matter, Gentlemen, on which I &s;hall pro|ceed, is the evidence which I purpo&s;e to addre&s;s to you; and that evidence will go to &s;hew not only the fact of this man's being the writer of this book, by his own repeated admi&s;&s;ion, and by letters under his hand; but to &s;hew what his intention was, I &s;hall al&s;o pro|duce to you a letter which this gentleman was plea&s;ed to addre&s;s to my&s;elf, in which letter he avows him&s;elf in &s;o many words the author. I &s;hall prove his hand|writing, I &s;hall prove the intention with which this book was written, namely, to vilify this con&s;titution, and injure this nation. I have another letter addre&s;&s;ed to a per&s;on of the name of Jordan, the publi&s;her of this book, in which he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this way:</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As there can be no per&s;onal re&s;entment be|tween two &s;trangers, I write this letter to you as to a man again&s;t whom I have no animo&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">You have, as Attorney General, commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t me, as the author of Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in con&s;e|quence of my being elected a member of the National Convention of France, called me from England, I &s;hould have &s;taid to have conte&s;ted the inju&s;tice of that pro&s;ecution, not upon my own account, for I cared nothing about the pro|&s;ecution, but to have defended the principles I had advanced in the work.</P>
<P>The duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble my&s;elf about your pro&s;ecution. When I have lei&s;ure I &s;hall have no objection to meet you on that ground; but as I now &s;tand, whether you go on with the pro&s;ecution, or whether you do not, or whether you obtain a verdict or not, is a matter of the mo&s;t perfect indifference to me as an individual. If you obtain one (which you are welcome to&mdash;if you can get it), it cannot affect me, either in per&s;on, property, or reputation, otherwi&s;e than to encrea&s;e the latter; and with re&s;pect to your|&s;elf, it is as con&s;i&s;tent that you obtain a verdict again&s;t the man in the moon as again&s;t me: Neither do I &s;ee how you can continue the pro&s;ecution again&s;t me, as you would have done again&s;t one of your <HI>own people,</HI> who had ab&s;ented him&s;elf becau&s;e he was pro&s;ecuted. What pa&s;&s;ed at Dover proves that my departure from England was no &s;ecret.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">My nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence from your country now, in con&s;equence of my duty here, affords the op|portunity of knowing whether the pro&s;ecution was intended again&s;t Thomas Paine, or again&s;t the rights of the people of England to inve&s;tigate &s;y&s;tems and principles of government. For as I cannot now be the object of the pro&s;ecution, the going on with the pro&s;ecution will &s;hew that &s;omething el&s;e was the object, and that &s;ome|thing el&s;e can be no other than the people of England; for it is again&s;t <HI>their rights,</HI> and not again&s;t me, that a verdict or &s;entence can operate, if it can operate at all&mdash;Be then &s;o candid as to tell the Jury (if you chu&s;e to continue the proce&s;s) again&s;t whom it is you are proceeding, and on whom it is the verdict is to fall.</P>
<P>But I have other rea&s;ons than tho&s;e I have mentioned, for writing you this letter; and how|ever you may chu&s;e to interpret them, they pro|ceed from a good heart.</P>
<P>The time, Sir, is becoming too &s;erious to play with court pro&s;ecutions, and &s;port with national rights. The terrible examples that have taken place here upon men, who, le&s;s than a year ago, thought them&s;elves as &s;ecure as any pro&s;ecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney-General, can now do in England, ought to have &s;ome weight with men in your &s;ituation. That the government of Eng|land is as great, if not the greate&s;t perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place &s;ince governments began, is what you cannot be a
<PB N="26" REF="27">&s;tranger to, unle&s;s the con&s;tant habit of &s;eeing it has blinded your &s;en&s;es. But though you may not chu&s;e to &s;ee it, the people are &s;eeing it very fa&s;t; and the progre&s;s is beyond what you may chu&s;e to believe. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that you or I can believe, or that rea&s;on can make any other man believe, that the capacity of &s;uch a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate &s;ons, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the government of a nation? I &s;peak to you as one man ought to &s;peak to another; and I know al&s;o, that I &s;peak what other people are beginning to think.</P>
<P>That you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do, it will &s;ignify nothing) without packing a Jury (and we both know that &s;uch tricks are practi&s;ed), is what I have very great rea&s;on to be|lieve. I have gone into coffee-hou&s;es, and places where I was unknown, on purpo&s;e to learn the currency of opinions; and I never yet &s;aw any company of twelve men that condemned the book, but I have often found a greater number than twelve approving it; and this I think is a fair way of collecting the natural currency of opinion.</P>
<P>Do not then, Sir, be the in&s;trument of drawing twelve men into a &s;ituation that may be injurious to them afterwards. I do not &s;peak this from policy, but from benevolence; but if you chu&s;e to go on with the proce&s;s, I make it my reque&s;t to you that you will read this letter in Court; after which the Judge and the Jury may do as they plea&s;e.&mdash;As I do not con&s;ider my&s;elf the
<PB N="27" REF="28">object of the pro&s;ecution, neither can I be af|fected by the i&s;&s;ue one way or the other. I &s;hall, though a foreigner in your country, &s;ub&s;cribe as much money, as any other man, towards &s;upport|ing the rights of the nation again&s;t the pro&s;ecu|tion, and it is for this purpo&s;e only that I &s;hall do it.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, I have complied with his reque&s;t, I am practi&s;ing it, and if I &s;ucceed he &s;hall never return to this country, for I will outlaw him, He goes on: "But I &s;hall offer rea&s;ons for writing this letter, &amp;c" In this &s;ituation, Gentlemen, I will only &s;ay this, that I think Mr. Paine does not judge very well of mankind. I do not think that is a fair conclu&s;ion in Mr. Paine, that men who are quiet, in obedience to the laws of the country, decently, and I hope with a moderate &s;hare of reputation, I do not think that a con&s;iderate man of that &s;ort is ju&s;t a very likely man to be thrown off the hinges; but if any of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins are here, or in London, and there is really &s;ome doubt with &s;ome people on that
<PB N="28" REF="29">&s;ubject; I, for one, think, Gentlemen, that a man's dying in di&s;charge of his duty, is ju&s;t as good a way of dying as dying of a raging fever, or in a fit of the gout or &s;tone. He &s;ays, <Q>the government of England is as great, if not the greate&s;t produc|tion of fraud and corruption that ever took place in any government;</Q> and that, <Q>he who does not ob&s;erve it is blind:</Q> Upon my word, Gentlemen, I am &s;tone-blind then. <Q>But though you may not chu&s;e to &s;ee it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Now, Gentlemen, this is contemptuous, &s;candalous, fal&s;e, pro&s;titute, profligate. Why, Gentlemen, is Mr. Paine, in addition to the po|litical doctrines that he is teaching us in this country, is he to teach us impeccability, is he to teach us human creatures, who&s;e momentary exi&s;tence de|pends on a Being merciful, long-&s;uffering, and of great goodne&s;s, that tho&s;e errors, from which even royalty is not excepted, are to be detailed at great length, and are all to be mentioned in language &s;hocking for Briti&s;h ears to hear, and I am &s;ure di&s;|gu&s;ting to their hearts? No man, that is not a bar|barian and a bea&s;t, would wi&s;h to de&s;troy that great &s;ecurity of all human laws and con&s;titutions, the Chri&s;tian religion. Gentlemen, there is not, per|haps, in the world, a better rule to judge by in do|me&s;tic matters. A family is a &s;mall kingdom; a kingdom is a large family. Judge for your&s;elves, Gentlemen, of the good heart of this man, who thru&s;ts into my hands, who am, if not an u&s;eful, at lea&s;t a grateful &s;ervant of a kind ma&s;ter, the &s;lander of that ma&s;ter, and the &s;lander of his children: what will be your verdict with re&s;pect to his heart?
<PB N="29" REF="30">He &s;ays, "I ob&s;erve to you as one man ought to &s;peak to another;" does he &s;peak of him and his family as one man &s;hould to another? and I &s;hould have forgot my duty to that ma&s;ter, if I forgot to pro&s;ecute him as a violator of the law of the land: He &s;ays, "I know, al&s;o I &s;peak, what people feel, that you cannot obtain a verdict, and if you do it will &s;ignify nothing, without packing a Jury&mdash;and we both know that &s;uch facts are practi&s;ed." Gentle|men, I know of no &s;uch facts; I know of no &s;uch practice; I know the very contrary of tho&s;e facts or practice, and I know this letter was intended for future publication. Gentlemen, he &s;ays, "I have gone into coffee-hou&s;es and ale-hou&s;es, where I was unknown, and where there is a currency of opinion, and I never yet &s;aw any company of twelve men that condemned the book, but a greater number than twelve approving it." Now, Gentlemen, whether the &s;en&s;e of the nation is to be taken from the opinions of pot-hou&s;es and ale-hou&s;es, you are to judge. Gentlemen, I will give you a thou&s;and gue&s;&s;es to judge of his motive; but he &s;ays, it is from bene|volence: He further &s;ays, "I de&s;ire you will read this letter in Court." Gentlemen, I have done &s;o; "after which the Judge and Jury may do as they plea&s;e." He &s;ays, "I would have publi&s;hed the Information, with remarks upon it; but I now will wait till the trial is over, and then I will make &s;ome ob&s;ervati|ons." I hope in God, Gentlemen, he will not omit one &s;ingle word that I have &s;aid this day: At pre|&s;ent
<PB N="30" REF="31">I do not think I need trouble you any further. I can have but one opinion, which is, that the mi&s;chie|vous tendency of this book is that which I have taken the liberty to enlarge upon; and that &s;uch will be your verdict. However, I have done my duty, in bringing before you an offender of this &s;ort: Be the event what it may, I am &s;atisfied in having placed the public under the &s;hield of your protection.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> I cannot directly remember, Sir; it was the beginning of the year 1791.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you recollect what book it was which you &s;ay Mr. Paine had?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"><HI>A.</HI> It was the Fir&s;t Part of the Rights of Man.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Mr. Chapman, are you a publi&s;her as well as a printer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I am not, I am merely a printer.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you print the Fir&s;t Fart of the Rights of Man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who was the &s;elling book&s;eller?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Mr. Jordan of Fleet Street. I had intercour&s;e with Mr. Jordan and Mr. Paine with re&s;pect: to that book, merely relative to the manner of publishing the book.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did Mr. Jordan in fact publi&s;h that book?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He did.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Had you any intercour&s;e with Mr. Paine rela|tive to printing this book I have in my hand?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I had the fir&s;t edition of this book, I do not mean that I printed this edition of it&mdash;this is the Second Part.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Look again at this book.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I printed a part of that Second Part.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will you inform my Lord and the Jury what part of it you did print?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I printed, Sir, as far as page 112, &s;ignature H.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"><HI>Q.</HI> By &s;ignature H I believe you mean that letter H which is at the bottom of the &s;heet?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Upon who&s;e employment did you print &s;o much of the Second Part of the Rights of Man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Mr. Paine's.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you print the re&s;t to the conclu&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I had the manu&s;cript in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as far as page 146; I &s;topped at 112, but my people had compo&s;ed to page 146.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Now, Mr. Chapman, had you any conver&s;a|tion with Mr. Paine relative to the printing the re|mainder of the work; and if you had, what was that conver&s;ation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I had: When I had fini&s;hed page 112, letter H, the proof &s;heet <HI>I</HI> came into my hands; on exa|mining &s;heet I, there was a part which, in my weak judgment, appeared of a dangerous tendency; I, therefore, immediately concluded in my mind not to proceed any further. Accordingly, on deter|mining not to go through with the work, I wrote a &s;hort note to Mr. Paine; this was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, determining to &s;end the letter with the copy the following morning.&mdash;I found a con&s;i|derable reluctance in my own mind, from his civili|ties as a gentleman and an employer; but a circum|&s;tance occurred in the evening which enabled me to do it with &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf; and as it may, in the eyes of the Court, exculpate me from a charge which Mr. Paine has thought proper to en|ter again&s;t me, I &s;hall e&s;teem it a favour to be &s;uf|fered

<TRAILER>T. Paine, E&s;q.</TRAILER>
</LETTER></NOTE>, &s;o that he mu&s;t have called upon me on the 16th; he called on me, which was rather unu&s;ual, intoxicated; he had dined, I believe, at Mr. John&s;on's, in St. Paul's Church Yard; being intoxicated, he introduced a &s;ubject which we had unfortunately differed upon many times, namely <HI>religion,</HI> which he was very fond of introducing when he was &s;o: The &s;ubject ran very high with great virulence on the part of Mr. Paine, till at length it came to great per&s;onal abu&s;e both to my&s;elf and Mrs. Chapman. An observation was made late in the evening (I believe 10 o'clock) at which he was particularly offended, and &s;aid he had not been &s;o per&s;onally affronted in his life. Mr. Paine accordingly aro&s;e, declaring, that as I was a Di&s;&s;enter, he had a very bad opinion of Di&s;&s;enters in general, and believed them all to be a pack of
<PB N="34" REF="35">hypocrites, and therefore he mu&s;t be very cautious of them: He begged to have a &s;ettlement in the morning. The next morning, at eight o'clock, I &s;aw him&mdash;he called upon me, and made many apologies for what he had &s;aid; and ob&s;erved, it was the effect of liquor, and hoped I would proceed on the work: I again &s;tated my rea&s;ons to him, for not going on with the work.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You have told us that Mr. Paine was your employer, &s;o far on as you printed: Did you ever make any offer to any-body, to buy the Second Part of the Rights of Man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did, to Mr. Paine: I made him &s;everal offers, in the different &s;tages of the work: The fir&s;t, I believe, was 100 guineas; the &s;econd, was 500; and the la&s;t was 1000. Mr. Paine, to the be&s;t of my recollection, an&s;wered, that as it was his in|tention to publi&s;h a &s;mall edition of the work, he wi&s;hed to re&s;erve it in his own hands.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Attorney General, in that part of his addre&s;s to you which aro&s;e from the communication of the letter written to him from France, did not appear to me at all to play the actor; when he ex|hibited, mo&s;t undoubtedly, &s;igns of great &s;en&s;ibility and emotion, he &s;poke, I am per&s;uaded, as his own feelings dictated. With re&s;pect to his &s;ituation in receiving that letter, and feeling it his duty to pre|&s;ent it before you, Gentlemen, if his embarra&s;&s;ment were that which he expre&s;&s;ed, and that which he felt, what do you think mine mu&s;t be? And, Gen|tlemen, as I am per&s;uaded my learned friend, for we have known one another from our childhood up|wards, does not con&s;ider me to be bereft of tho&s;e feelings which belong to the human mind when it is well cultivated, though I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s them, I am per&s;uaded, in the degree he has the means to feel
<PB N="34" REF="40">them; yet, I tru&s;t, my mind is not un&s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch &s;en&s;ations. He &s;peaks, as he can only &s;peak, as a &s;ubject of a &s;overeign, who&s;e high &s;ituation re|moves him too far from his &s;ubjects to have any other affections than tho&s;e which grow from his great &s;ituation in &s;ociety. You will remember, Gen|tlemen, that I &s;tand in the &s;ame &s;ituation towards another great per&s;onage, who is implicated in that which I am ready to admit to you is a gro&s;s and &s;candalous libel, and that that is the mo&s;t improper part of that letter which has been read, though I &s;tand in a different relation. Be&s;ides the duty I owe to that Prince to whom I am a &s;ervant, I owe to him and feel for him that affection which he de|mands as a man; but that &s;hall not detach me from the duty which I conceive belongs to my pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation. I &s;tand here, Gentlemen, to do that which, if it were not done by me, the Author of this book, if in your eyes he is criminal for detracting as he has done from the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, he would have ample ground indeed for that detraction; for an im|partial trial is one of the fruits we all hope is derived from that con&s;titution under which we live, and from which we derive &s;o many benefits. It would appear, I am per&s;uaded, a blur and a blot upon that con&s;titution, if a man, &s;tanding upon his trial, could &s;ay he could not be defended. I confe&s;s, Gentlemen, I &s;hould have been glad if I had had an earlier opportunity of knowing correctly the con|tents of that letter. I &s;hould have been glad if I
<PB N="35" REF="41">could have had an earlier opportunity al&s;o of know|ing, which I do not admit at pre&s;ent, that it was genuine and authentic; becau&s;e I know not only the impre&s;&s;ion which &s;uch a letter mu&s;t make upon Gen|tlemen's minds who are the Jury to try the cau&s;e, but I feel the impre&s;&s;ion it nece&s;&s;arily makes upon my own mind: but, as far as nature is able to &s;truggle again&s;t any difficulties thrown in, and with my duty to my client, I will exert it in the be&s;t manner I am able. I confe&s;s I cannot help thinking it would be a great advantage to the public, if the Attorney General is right in his comment upon the book, that by the law of England this book cannot exi&s;t, or be circulated, from the matter contained in it. I cannot help thinking he thought it for the intere&s;t of his country, and the merits of his pro&s;e|cution, to read that letter. That letter contained what is wholly foreign to the pro&s;ecution before you, and my Lord could not receive it upon any other principle than this, that it admitted the Defendant was the author of it, and might tend to prove <HI>quo animo,</HI> that book was written by him. Gentlemen, no one fact whatever has been proved by the At|torney General as coming from the Defendant; or are they capable of fa&s;tening upon him one act pre|vious to the work before you. No one expre&s;&s;ion that he meant to produce civil war and di&s;cord in England; nothing reproachful either to the character or conduct of the Sovereign, or any of the family. And that letter is written months and months after
<PB N="36" REF="42">this book, which is the work of his brain, and after he had been, in a manner, drove from and expelled his country, to a new &s;ociety; where new ideas may have &s;tarted up in his mind long &s;ub&s;equent to the work, and which, therefore, do not furni&s;h any fair commentary on the work it&s;elf. My friend has &s;tated to you, that rumour has &s;pread it abroad that this pro&s;ecution is carried on by him as a public of|ficer of the crown, without any private approbation of his own; and he thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, and I think it right, to think, if he does &s;o think, it has his concurrence, and he &s;hould hold him&s;elf di&s;graced in his profe&s;&s;ion, of which he is &s;o honourable a member, and in &s;ociety, if he had not brought this matter before you. Here he and I &s;tand in a little different &s;ituation: he tells you rumour has &s;pread it abroad; I am per&s;uaded it has &s;o as to come to his ears. You will attend to truth or fal&s;ehood, and I might call upon all around me, except the few that are about the Attorney General, and who are within the immediate intelligence which he can convey, and a&s;k, Whether that rumour has &s;pread it&s;elf abroad to any large or extended circle? With re|&s;pect to my&s;elf, do I &s;tand in that &s;ituation before you? Can you go to any of the places where men re&s;ort for plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, without &s;eeing my name attacked and character wounded and torn to pieces for only doing that which, till I die, or while I continue in this profe&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall always continue to do? That is, without making my&s;elf a party in
<PB N="37" REF="43">the cau&s;e, without undertaking the defence of this or any other man, I will a&s;&s;ert the freedom and in|tegrity of the Engli&s;h bar, with which the mo&s;t va|luable part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is lo&s;t; for from the moment that any Engli&s;h advocate can &s;tate he will or not &s;tand between the Crown and the Subject that is put upon his trial, from that moment the liberty of the &s;ubject is gone. If a man high in the profe&s;&s;ion pre&s;umes to give judgment again&s;t the Defendant, he a&s;&s;umes the character of judicature; and if he is a man of &s;ome reputation (and my &s;itua|tion entitles me to &s;uppo&s;e I have &s;ome) refu&s;es to do it, how is any man to be defended? But, Gentlemen, I have no complaint to make, either again&s;t tho&s;e printers who have circulated opinions, or the authors of them. I take it a great many of them may be deluded, &s;o as to think they render a &s;ervice to the public. If there be any de&s;cription of men, who, from malice and inju&s;tice, or from per&s;onal di&s;regard to me, have mixed in it, I forgive them; but I &s;tand here, in my &s;ituation at the bar, to defend this book and the author in the manner I conceive by the laws of England they may be defended. Gentlemen, I could not help mentioning this, but I &s;hould rather, I believe, po&s;tpone it for further con&s;ideration. It is now my duty to &s;tate to you what the que&s;tion in this cau&s;e is; for if it were the que&s;tion which rumour has invented and perverted, if it were the que&s;tion that tho&s;e who have &s;o thought and &s;poken of me had conceived, it would
<PB N="38" REF="44">be a very &s;peedy determination; the que&s;tion is not, Whether the con&s;titution of our fathers, under which we live, and under which I now pre&s;ent my&s;elf be|fore you, be or be not preferable to the con&s;titution of America, or the con&s;titution of France, or any other human con&s;titution? In the nature of things that cannot be the que&s;tion. Gentlemen, I will put this matter in a light in which it appears to me, not merely the &s;tronge&s;t for the Defendant, but the &s;tronge&s;t for us all; for, though I abhor the calum|ny in the concluding part of that letter which has been read, there are truths in it which it imports us all to con&s;ider; and, I am convinced, every man in a court of judicature, to dive&s;t him&s;elf of all pre|judices, and meet fairly the ca&s;e of the parties that are &s;ubmitted to their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it has been a&s;&s;erted loudly and vari|ou&s;ly, and Parliament has been a&s;&s;embled together out of the ordinary mode, upon the pre&s;umption that the&s;e things were of mi&s;chievous tendency. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e I am now addre&s;&s;ing &s;ome gentlemen infected with the doctrine of this book, and have no love for the con&s;titution of the country, and believe the country would be happier under the form of a republic. I have no difficulty in a&s;&s;erting, that if there were any of that opinion, and I believe I am not addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to &s;uch, but if I were addre&s;&s;|ing my&s;elf to any who had &s;uch ideas, I &s;hould &s;ay, you cannot upon that ground find a verdict for the Defendant. You are bound to convict him, pro|vided,
<PB N="39" REF="45">in your judgment, he has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e limits the wi&s;dom and policy of the law of Eng|land (and it was that principle that made the con|&s;titution) have allowed, not merely for the pre&s;erva|tion of the law of England, but for the liberty and freedom of the pre&s;s; therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould have any other &s;pecies of juri&s;diction: you have no authority but by the law of England; you have no right to give a verdict, and his lord&s;hip has no right to pa&s;s &s;entence again&s;t the Defendant, but for that juri&s;diction, which the &s;ame law confers upon him; and therefore the que&s;tion is not whe|ther that law under which we live, is &s;uperior or infe|rior to any other law, but whether it is upon tho&s;e principles upon which the con&s;titution gave us that law, and that which is continued, and which the con&s;titution does &s;upport; and whether it does or does not give any man liberty to write as the Defendant in this book has written. Gentlemen, it may appear, in the outline of a cau&s;e like this, to be a large con|ce&s;&s;ion, but my learned friend would &s;ay, it is rather an artful declaration of coun&s;el; but it is neither, for it is truth: but if true, and I cannot &s;uppofe go|vernment had not &s;ome foundation for a&s;&s;ertions &s;o general, if I were addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to men who had read this book, who&s;e &s;ouls were impre&s;&s;ed with this book, who thought they were doing God ho|nour, and human nature ju&s;tice, by ha&s;tening to a revolution; I &s;hould think my&s;elf wrong, if, as an advocate in an Engli&s;h court, and I &s;hould think I
<PB N="40" REF="46">di&s;grace my profe&s;&s;ion if I &s;aid, upon tho&s;e princi|ples, you could not give judgment for the Defendant. The law binds every man's conduct, and, therefore, it binds your conduct and mine, but it leaves opi|nion free and open; the con&s;equence follows there|fore ab&s;olutely, and without any po&s;&s;ibility of drawing a di&s;tinction; but if, upon the other hand, you &s;hould di&s;approve of the matter contained in the book, and feel that your own government, which he detracts from in &s;everal circum&s;tances, is far more valuable and firm in its original con&s;truction, than that which he repre&s;ents, and is not &s;ubject to en|croachments or abu&s;es which he &s;tates, and that the propagation of the doctrines of it may tend to alienate the opinions and affections of &s;ome of the people, the &s;ubjects of the country, from the go|vernment of the country, &s;till you cannot, upon that footing, convict him, without going beyond tho&s;e limits, unle&s;s he has over&s;tepped that authority which the law of England has con&s;tituted as the &s;cope and bound of the freedom of the pre&s;s. Gen|tlemen, admit with the Attorney General, for it is in vain to deny it, that in every matter where you are to inve&s;tigate the mind of the man that has writ|ten, you mu&s;t look al&s;o to the mind of the man who wrote it; you mu&s;t &s;ee whether it is written <HI>bona fide,</HI> as lawyers expre&s;s it: but that, like every other que&s;tion of ju&s;tice, mu&s;t depend upon the evidence before a court of ju&s;tice, and on the opinion of the court on that evidence; and therefore, whenever a
<PB N="41" REF="47">man is to be judged by any thing but the work it&s;elf, and the con&s;truction that work affords; if it is nece&s;|&s;ary to connect it with any other extrin&s;ic matter, that extrin&s;ic matter mu&s;t be put on a part of the record: as, for in&s;tance&mdash;if Mr. Attorney General &s;hould &s;ay, I do not mean to &s;ay that the&s;e things were written at another time, I do not mean to &s;ay, if they were circulated in a different manner, or connected with different circum&s;tances, which I &s;ay was the ca&s;e of this book, it would be productive of bad con&s;e|quences, but that it was owing to the &s;ituation of France at this pre&s;ent moment; and it is owing to the &s;itua|tion of that people, who have introduced and erected a republic, which Mr. Paine wi&s;hes to introduce into this country, for which purpo&s;e he writes a book, which at this moment is before you, and which I am to put a con&s;truction upon, and to &s;ubmit tho&s;e circum&s;tances to your con&s;ideration, I humbly con|tend before his lord&s;hip, that the law requires, for the &s;afety of mankind, that any charge which a &s;ub|ject of the country is called upon to an&s;wer, &s;hall be put literally on the record, that he may know what crime it is that he comes to an&s;wer. The Defend|ant here comes to an&s;wer having written this book; it does not &s;tate any extrin&s;ic circum&s;tances which render the writing of this book criminal in one in|&s;tance, though it might be criminal in another; it does not &s;tate any times or &s;ea&s;ons of publication, but it is &s;etting down to pen the&s;e &s;entences, and &s;end|ing them to the world, that con&s;titutes the off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">
<PB N="42" REF="48">and con&s;equently the grammatical con&s;truction of the book not in bits and &s;craps. The Attorney General, out of a book of 178 pages, has plucked only four and a half; but whether tho&s;e &s;entences be or no beyond the liberty of the pre&s;s, which the law of England has given for the mo&s;t wi&s;e and u&s;eful purpo&s;es of &s;ociety; it is not whether you approve the book; not whether you condemn part of the pa&s;&s;ages of it; not whether you are of the &s;ame opinion with the author; but whether the man, at the time he wrote it, felt as he wrote, and whether he de&s;cribed him&s;elf as he felt. If my learned friend could make out to you this propo&s;ition, I admit he will &s;tand in a very different &s;ituation before the court. Mr. Paine ad|mired the con&s;truction of the Engli&s;h government, per&s;uaded of its virtues, con&s;cious of the benefit de|rived from it to all the &s;ubjects under it; wi&s;hing to de&s;cribe the happine&s;s which is enjoyed under the con&s;titution, with that belief he &s;ets down to write tho&s;e pages. He could not be defended or pro|tected for what he wrote, if he him&s;elf is deceived, and believes that which other men might materially differ from him in. If he thinks what you and I do not think, and under that impre&s;&s;ion, and the ge|nuine apprehen&s;ion of his under&s;tanding, he &s;ets down to write this book, he is not guilty of any of|fence again&s;t the law of England, although what he writes may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of our government. I take it to be a great part of the free|dom of the Engli&s;h government, that every man,
<PB N="43" REF="49">as I &s;tated before, &s;hould be protected in the cour&s;e of his trial; and I believe al&s;o, if the advocate en|tertains &s;entiments ho&s;tile to the principles of the man he defends, he is not only ju&s;tified, but called upon to conceal tho&s;e particular &s;entiments from the court: if his &s;entiments happen to be different from the man he is defending, he is equally bound to &s;tate them; on the other hand, if his &s;entiments ap|pear to be beneficial, he is equally bound to declare them. Now I know I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf per|fectly well to &s;ubjects of this country, and therefore entitled to &s;uppo&s;e, what I have every rea&s;on to do, I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to tho&s;e that are &s;atisfied with the con&s;titution of this country. I know very well every thing would come with very little weight from any quarter hat could be &s;u&s;pected upon that head, therefore I give the Defendant the benefit of contend|ing he is not guilty; and I give him the benefit of knowing, that which it is not nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould know, that I profe&s;s my&s;elf to be a man who love and admire the genuine principles of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; that you may know what comes from me comes from no &s;u&s;pected quarter. I give the Defendant the liberty of the pre&s;s in &s;aying his opi|nion differs from mine; though you may think, as I take it for granted you do, that mine and yours are better than his, and that the form of our government is far better than that which he approves and wi&s;hes to inculcate, there is an end of the freedom of Eng|land, and of that con&s;titution we all profe&s;s to love, if
<PB N="44" REF="50">every man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an opinion, may not freely write tho&s;e &s;entiments, which he does not take up upon the &s;pur of a particular occa&s;ion, but merely to expre&s;s the &s;entiments of his mind. Gentlemen, the principle I mean to lay down as to the liberty of the Engli&s;h pre&s;s is this, that every man may ad|dre&s;s him&s;elf, not to individuals to excite them to di&s;obedience to the laws, but that every man may addre&s;s him&s;elf to the individuals of a whole nation, and may in that addre&s;s canva&s;s the propriety and advantage of the form of government in general, and the government in a particular country which he inhabits; that he may find fault with the con&s;titution, that he may take it to pieces, that he may point out its errors and defects, and &s;tate what are its corrup|tions, and what are likely to be the con&s;equences, and where the public, from falling into tho&s;e cor|ruptions are long &s;uffered to remain; and in doing all that, he is not a &s;ubject of criminal ju&s;tice, unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn, that at the time he &s;o wrote, and at the time he &s;o publi&s;hed, he did it, not contemplat|ing the happine&s;s, but &s;eeking the mi&s;ery of the hu|man race; that he did it at a time, &s;eeking to bring about con&s;ultations in a country by exciting indivi|duals, and informing them they had a right to think and act for them&s;elves, and that any individual might, in his di&s;cretion, oppo&s;e the general law of the &s;tate; I have no difficulty in &s;aying, that if it &s;hall be found, upon an attentive peru&s;al of the works of the Defendant, he inculcates tho&s;e doctrines, nay, if the
<PB N="45" REF="51">direct contrary &s;hall not be found, or if it &s;hall appear that he &s;ays to one m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n what we might &s;uppo&s;e to have been &s;aid by him, and what was &s;aid by an unfortunate criminal who &s;tood heire in&s;ulting the court for a length of time ye&s;terday, who, in&s;tead of &s;aying I was a pri&s;oner, I put up the&s;e premi&s;es to be &s;old, becau&s;e the French will &s;peedily come and relea&s;e us, and I did it to excite others to relea&s;e me from my impri&s;onment; if there could be one &s;ylla|ble that could have put that man's defence in the pre&s;ent Defendant's mouth, in the face of a patient judge, I mu&s;t &s;ay, upon that occa&s;ion, he &s;hould be held up to the ju&s;tice of his country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;ay, and I &s;ay it in the name of Thomas Paine, the Defendant, the Author of the Rights of Man, and in his words, which I &s;hall read to you,&mdash;<Q>The end of all political a&s;&s;ociations is the pre&s;ervation of the rights of man, which rights are liberty, property, and &s;ecurity; that the nation is the &s;ource of all &s;overeignty derived from it; the right of property being &s;ecured and invio|lable, no one ought to be deprived of it, ex|cept in ca&s;es of evident public nece&s;&s;ity, legally a&s;certained, and on condition of a previous ju&s;t in|demnity.</Q> Gentlemen, tho&s;s are undoubtedly the rights of man. The rights of man it is the end of all governments to e&s;tabli&s;h; and I &s;ay no man, af|ter any government id legally con&s;tituted, can with|our rebellion withdraw his allegiance from that go|vernment which he has lived under and paid obedi|ence to; that all attempts again&s;t it are unwi&s;e and
<PB N="46" REF="52">unju&s;t, as well as criminal, for the be&s;t rea&s;ons are policy, ju&s;tice; and nothing &s;hort of the will of a whole people can change any form or &s;pecies of go|vernment. Any man, therefore, who is told by an|other he has a right to act and think for him&s;elf, that he is no longer to wait, that he is no longer to &s;ee whether the operation of that conviction &s;hall be equal to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, but the moment he has brought him&s;elf to a conclu&s;ion that any part is defective, he is not to &s;ee whether it will be meliorated by common con&s;ent, but that from that moment his own judgment and under&s;tanding &s;hall free him from the opinion the law is wi&s;e and the con&s;titution is ju&s;t, he may pull it down, and re|fu&s;e all the obedience to the law and the govern|ment; unle&s;s I can convince you that the Defendant has taken pains to inculcate direct contrary, doc|trine, a doctrine that is directly contrary to the peace and older of the country, however his own con&s;ci|ence may acquit him, he cannot be acquitted at the tribunal of an Engli&s;h Jury. Does any man &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on can write a book to another, and &s;ay, The in&s;tant I can convince you the government of Eng|land is defective, you are to go about to de&s;troy it? But, on the other hand, had it not been that per|&s;ons had a right (and thanks be to God, and thanks be to our con&s;titution for permitting it) to explain tho&s;e inalienable rights which nature has given us, and that &s;pirit which God has given us, how &s;hould we have had that con&s;titution we &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;t of? No man could have gone before and pointed out the
<PB N="47" REF="53">abu&s;es of the form of government under which he lived: or how could the government have pa&s;&s;ed on from &s;tate to &s;tate, &s;o as to have ari&s;en to &s;uch a pitch of perfection, to &s;uch a &s;tate of maturation, that the Attorney General con&s;iders it as profanation to touch it? Gentlemen, you under&s;tand the princi|ple upon which I mean to defend my client; and I will not advance one &s;tep further till I put him bet|ter in your minds than it is po&s;&s;ible he can &s;tand at pre&s;ent, either from what you have heard from abroad, or what you have heard in court, or from the means mo&s;t unque&s;tionable taken to cry down this book and the Author, who &s;tands in a &s;ituation dif|ferent almo&s;t from any other man who ever pre&s;ented him&s;elf in an Engli&s;h court of ju&s;tice. If I were to a&s;k you, Gentlemen of the Jury, what it is that is the la&s;t fruit of the tree of liberty, not what they de&s;cribe it, but what they would wi&s;h it, the Eng|li&s;h tree of liberty; if I may emphatically expre&s;s what is the fruit of that tree, it is &s;ecurity of the rights under the law, not only the rights of pro|perty, but the rights of liberty and reputation. How are we to have tho&s;e rights, but by the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice? Con&s;equently there is not a man in England ever brought upon the circum&s;tances he repre&s;ents him&s;elf before a court and jury, there can be any prejudices in tho&s;e who are to hear the cau&s;e. So anxiou&s;ly does the con&s;titution guard again&s;t tho&s;e evils, that if the &s;malle&s;t circulation
<PB N="48" REF="54">of any paper that leads to the perver&s;ion od ju&s;tice, or if from the be&s;t motives a per&s;on &s;hall do the lea&s;t thing that can at all affect the ju&s;tice of the tribunal, from that moment the trial is po&s;tponed. If his Lord&s;hip will give me leave to remind him, upon the trial of the Dean of St. A&s;aph, or rather when he was brought to trial, there was a circulation of books read, not books relative to the object of trial, not books, that affected to take notice even that he was coming to any trial, but extracts from ancient authors of high reputation, pointing out the rights of jurors, and &s;hewing that juror had a right to con&s;ider the innocence or guilt of the party, the No|ble Lords put off the trial of the cau&s;e, not from any particular opinion that the&s;e writings were fal&s;e, but becau&s;e it was out of even cour&s;e of trial. Gentle|men, in what &s;ituation do I &s;tand before you? This unfortunate Defendant and his book have been pre|judged in a thou&s;and &s;hapes, but, what is more ex|traordinary, pending the very trial, and when the cau&s;e was &s;tanding upon the paper. Gentlemen whom, I take it for granted, mean well to the coun|try (though I have no doubt other per&s;ons act upon the &s;ame principle); but gentlemen who &s;eem to know &s;o little of the con&s;equences, publi&s;hed through|out the world a prote&s;t again&s;t this very work of Mr. Paine; Gentlemen who &s;eem &s;o fond of holding up that con&s;titution it is circulated throughout&mdash;it meets you at a turnpike, it is thrown down your areas, it is thrown into your chai&s;e. An an&s;wer to
<PB N="49" REF="55">this very book, which is now to receive a judg|ment; nay, that very tribunal, much higher than that in which we now &s;it, and in which I have the honour to be a member, and my learned friends know the truth of what I &s;ay, that from what has pa&s;&s;ed in that hou&s;e, and gone on in every channel of circulation, this cau&s;e is prejudg|ed. I do not make this ob&s;ervation relating to his Lord&s;hip, for there has not been a motion be|fore to po&s;tpone the trial. I know perfectly well, if any &s;uch motion had been made, the effect of it would have been what ju&s;tice and law required. No man can re&s;pect more the ju&s;tice that I am &s;ure I &s;hould have received than my&s;elf. What is the con&s;equence of all this? You are to guard your again&s;t every thing, except that which meets you here. You ought to come prepared to look at this work, to give it its genuine con&s;truction, and to collect the evi|dence in the cau&s;e. With re&s;pect to the letter, I &s;hall &s;ay a word at the conclu&s;ion of my addre&s;s. You will at pre&s;ent put it wholly out of your mind as being written long &s;ub&s;equent to the book; then the cau&s;e will &s;tand thus: the Defendant wrote the book, and &s;ends word he is de&s;irous to be given up as the author of it, if any criminal inquiry takes place. There is not any evidence whatever of an indi&s;creet declaration; no taunting expre&s;&s;ion pre|vious to the publication; not any thing that might not come out of the mouth of a man meaning no harm. It is not a libel upon the King. charged
<PB N="50" REF="56">upon the record. I never heard that &s;uch a letter had been brought about&mdash;I know nothing but from the record&mdash;I had &s;een &s;omething which profe&s;&s;ed to be a copy of a letter&mdash;I &s;aid it was a foul forgery to embarra&s;s the cau&s;e; and it comes at a time that it produces embarra&s;&s;ment in my mind, and tends to prejudice my ca&s;e.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t look, my learned friend &s;ays, at the nature of the book, and the con&s;equences it has produced; not only has it been publi&s;hed among the judicious part of the community, which was the ca&s;e with the fir&s;t part of the Rights of Man, which the Attorney General did not pro&s;ecute for a year and an half; he did not pro&s;ecute that book, becau&s;e he thought it would only extend among the judici|ous. Every one mu&s;t &s;ee whether the manner of the man is not as vi&s;ible in the one as the other; it would have been an antidote to the poi&s;on, and little might be hoped or feared from the circulation of it. But with re&s;pect to this work, its &s;ituation had been dif|ferent, and had gone down among all people, was printed on whited brown paper, was thru&s;t into the hands of children to wrap up their &s;weetmeats, and was circulated in every corner. I &s;hould humbly &s;ubmit to his Lord&s;hip, the mode of circulation of this book is not proved, neither the extent or the mode of circulation are proved, nor is there any evidence again&s;t the Defendant. Is it &s;aid that Mr. Paine de&s;ires the book might be &s;o circulated? If he had, there would have been an end; but did he or not,
<PB N="51" REF="57">at the time he was writing it, believe he was writing that which was beneficial to the Engli&s;h nation at large, and not meaning to deprive them of the ad|vantages they had, or contemplating their mi&s;ery? I am not examining what this man wi&s;hed, I am not inve&s;tigating that, but you mu&s;t look to the &s;itu|ation of the man from his education, from his ha|bits, and the whole hi&s;tory of his life, whether there is not one uniform ca&s;t of thinking to &s;hew this book was not written upon the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion, but from the re&s;ult of his mind, his &s;entiments, and a long cour&s;e of thinking for a long cour&s;e of years. I cannot help being &s;urpri&s;ed that Mr. Attorney General, in the whole cour&s;e of his addre&s;s, took no notice how this work fir&s;t came to be publi&s;hed in England; he de&s;ires you to take for granted Mr. Paine volunteered this fir&s;t part of the Rights of Man, and, if wrote in an&s;wer to nobody, it was a thing done for a malicious purpo&s;e, and that he had nothing at all to provoke that inquiry; that it was followed by the &s;econd part; that he was the fir&s;t man that &s;et about this attack. In order to &s;hew you how that matter is, I will read to you what my learned friend &s;ays, for the book mu&s;t be all in evidence together; when my learned friend reads to you a pa&s;&s;age con|cerning hereditary tyranny, or concerning the Ha|noverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, what is the foundation of the ob&s;ervation, that every man mu&s;t be judged mo&s;t un|que&s;tionably from what he writes, that the mind is &s;uppo&s;ed to go with the hand; it follows equally, if
<PB N="52" REF="58">you read any part of my book: it is common &s;en&s;e, and the common admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice &s;hews you, if you read any thing or any letter to make again&s;t me, you mu&s;t read the whole together, and judge of the object by all that he has written&mdash;that I &s;ee I have the a&s;&s;ent of his Lord&s;hip to&mdash;and you mu&s;t take it out of court; you are to look at the whole book, and compare tho&s;e parts with the context and the conclu&s;ion; and, above all, attend to that part which I am now about to read. He here &s;tates, in page 11 of the preface, before he begins the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently every man who reads the book has a warning before he begins what is the in|tention of the author. Read his introduction and pre|face, they have no other meaning than as a key or index to the intention of the author; and it is as much as to &s;ay, any man what reads my work, al|though I furni&s;h him with a clue to my &s;entiments and principles, and although I give him a preface, he leaves that our, and fa&s;tens a meaning and con|&s;truction different from that the preface it&s;elf would explain. He &s;ays, "I have differed from &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen," meaning gentlemen of our profe&s;&s;ion, <Q>on the &s;ubject of pro&s;ecutions, and I &s;ince find they are falling into my opinion, which I will here &s;tate as fully, but as conci&s;ely, as I can.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I will fir&s;t put a ca&s;e with re&s;pect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a con&s;ti|tution.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59"><Q>It would be an act of de&s;poti&s;m, or what in England is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohibit inve&s;tigating the principles, good or bad, on which &s;uch a law, or any other, is founded.</Q></P>
<P>He will put it upon the very footing the greate&s;t writers upon the Engli&s;h government have put it. He goes on&mdash;<Q>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppo&s;e the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expo&s;e its errors, to rea&s;on on its defects, and to &s;hew cau&s;e why it &s;hould be repealed, or why another ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion</Q> (making it al&s;o my practice), and there is no evidence he has not made it a practice (for he has never been called be|fore a court), <Q>it is better to obey a bad law, making u&s;e at the &s;ame time of every argument to &s;hew its errors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to vio|late it; becau&s;e the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to a di&s;|cretionary violation of tho&s;e which are good.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to principles and forms of government, or to what are called con&s;titutions and the parts of which they are com|po&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular indi|viduals, that mankind are at the expence of &s;upport|ing it. The defects of every government and con|&s;titution,
<PB N="54" REF="60">both as to principle and form, mu&s;t, on a parity of rea&s;oning, be as open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the defects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to &s;ociety to point them out. When tho&s;e defects, and the means of remedying them, are generally &s;een by a nation, that nation will reform its government or its con&s;titution in the one ca&s;e, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, you mo&s;t undoubtedly wi&s;h to deal with every man that comes before you in judgment as you de&s;ire to be dealt with your&s;elves, if you &s;hould accidentally publi&s;h any thing that might not be thought proper, and any man brings you to trial for it. And, I hope, it will not be laid down as law to-day, if you or I &s;hould publi&s;h any opinion concerning the government of this country, that &s;ome amendment was nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;hould point out the foundation upon which tho&s;e amendments were to be made, and were to explain the errors, that I am to be convicted or acquitted ju&s;t as twelve men &s;hall think. If I am not perfectly right in my argument, there is an end of all freedom, that has made the con&s;ti|tution what it is; and by and bye, I tru&s;t, will make it better in form, and purify it from tho&s;e abu&s;es which, if they had not exi&s;ted, we &s;hould not have been here to day in the trial of this cau&s;e. He &s;ays, I obey the law until it is repealed; I make it my practice; I mu&s;t not di&s;obey the law till it is repealed; I make it a duty to obey the law. If a
<PB N="55" REF="61">man choo&s;e to di&s;obey a law that was bad, the &s;ame would apply to any other man that would not obey a law that was good; and he &s;tates the advantages to &s;ociety in the different ages of the world. He goes on and &s;tates them in page 162, Second Part; the former pages in the preface were 11, 12. The rea|&s;on I am occupying a little portion of your time upon this &s;ubject, is with this view&mdash;I wi&s;h you to follow me throughout upon the principles I put the cau&s;e upon, that, if you find any thing in this book which inve&s;ts any individual, or any number of individuals in this country, or any thing but the whole nation it&s;elf, with the power of changing any part of the law or con&s;titution, I give up the cau&s;e. I mu&s;t give up the cau&s;e, becau&s;e I will not affront the maje&s;ty of the court with &s;tating propo&s;itions which mu&s;t be fal&s;e.

<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e are the &s;entiments of the author of this work&mdash;&s;entiments which I will take upon me to &s;ay have the highe&s;t authority for their foundation&mdash;&s;entiments which I think are the be&s;t title, and the &s;ecure&s;t title, that his Maje&s;ty and his family have for the throne of The&s;e kingdoms; and &s;o far am I from thinking his Maje&s;ty has any other advantage or foot|ing, that I thought it the highe&s;t act of attachment and fidelity I could &s;hew for a per&s;on I regard, and
<PB N="57" REF="63">&s;hall ever have the &s;ame affection for I have now, And I know the Attorney General can only &s;ay what he hopes, and I can only &s;peak of that part of the letter which &s;peaks of the profligacy of the royal children, which has been &s;o much held out for a great length of time; that &s;landerous profligacy that ought to have been checked through the pre&s;&s;es of this country. The Prince of Wales may be traduced and calumniated in every part of the kingdom, and they will never come in que&s;tion till they are brought in to load a defence with matter collateral to the charge; therefore I &s;ay, that which the Attorney General can only hope, but which I believe and know, that when|ever that Prince comes to be upon the throne of this country, (where I hope he will not but by the cour&s;e of nature) he will make the con&s;titution of this king|dom the foundation of his conduct; when I &s;ay that I am not in the &s;malle&s;t degree removed from contending the defendant is not guilty, and I &s;ay when he expre&s;&s;es &s;uch &s;entiments in this book, he expre&s;&s;es what is the intere&s;t of that illu&s;trious family to cheri&s;h, and I &s;poke it in the pre&s;ence of one of the illu&s;trious per&s;ons, as I have &s;ince been informed. I put the title of the King's Maje&s;ty, as I conceive it &s;tands upon the ge|nuine principles of the Revolution, that is upon the maje&s;ty of the people at elections, not as you elect the King of Poland, but as you elect a family in hereditary right, which in the &s;en&s;e which Mr. At|torney General would give, that has no proof in this country, therefore it is fit you &s;hould know how
<PB N="58" REF="64">the defendant came to write this book. God be thanked, the Attorney General knows my re&s;pect and value for him, and knows my &s;en&s;e of the honourable manner in which he has conducted him&s;elf from the beginning to the end of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that I would not throw the lea&s;t reflection upon him; but he will give me leave to &s;tate, and I wi&s;h it had not been left to me to &s;tate, how that fir&s;t principle came to be the work of Mr. Paine. Concerning Heredi|tary Right I will now tell you, and it will give you a clue to the mind of the author. Taking it for granted you and I go together in thinking Mr. Paine mi&s;taken in his opinion of the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution, and that we agree that King, Lords, and Commons, is &s;uperior to every thing the wit or wi&s;|dom of man ever put together, but the que&s;tion will be, whether he ever thought otherwi&s;e, and whe|ther he thought it badly governed under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, then the book will appear different totally from that light it is repre&s;ented to you. Gentlemen, we all of us remember the calamitous &s;ituation in which this country &s;tood a few year ago; a &s;ituation no good man can help looking back to without horror; a &s;ituation in which no man could feel him&s;elf &s;afe from its not happening again while the cau&s;es I am now about to &s;tate &s;till remain; I &s;peak of the Ame|rican war. This book, let it be known, for it ap|pears upon the face of it, is written as an an&s;wer to Mr. Burke; it is written as an an&s;wer to him, not only the &s;econd part, but the fir&s;t, written under the
<PB N="59" REF="65">circum&s;tances I &s;hall by and by explain, and in the cour&s;e of that explanation I &s;hall be obliged perhaps to cite one or two pa&s;&s;ages from the works of that celebrated per&s;on; and I &s;hall &s;peak of him with high re&s;pect, for it is impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Burke ever to make me forget him, whatever he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to think of me or my friends, who think as I do. With whatever contempt he may look down on my humble talents, when compared to his, he &s;hall never oblige me to forget the benefit the people of this country owe to him for the writings which he has left upon record, and for which thanks are due, next to the thanks which we ought to have to God, mo&s;t humbly for putting into our minds tho&s;e principles which are the &s;afe&s;t and &s;ure&s;t for our government; undoubtedly, though that celebrated per&s;on does not &s;eem to think now as he did formerly, and although the con&s;titu|tion, as Mr. Attorney General told you, has remained from all eternity to the pre&s;ent time, without any material change, except a melioration of it, mo&s;t undoubtedly that gentleman thinks very differently of it at pre&s;ent from what he did formerly; and if he had been as con&s;i&s;tent, and his opinion had been as uniform as Mr. Paine's, we &s;hould not have had this trial. Mr. Paine may be right, Mr. Burke cannot. Mr. Paine has not contradicted him&s;elf, Mr. Burke has. He may be wrong in part, or right in part; but if he is mi&s;taken throughout, it does not remove me from the ground of my defence.&mdash;That great and alarming conflict the American war, made Mr.
<PB N="60" REF="66">Paine a Republican, which he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be, and which I admit him to be; he means to de|clare it as his opinion to be a con&s;titution defective in its form, and attended with abu&s;es which one day or another, in his judgment, will bring ruin on us all. I don't mince the matter of the defendant, I put it whether you &s;hall be of opinion he thought &s;o when he wrote; &s;o whether he has written a matter that does contain any &s;lander upon the magi&s;tracy of the King's per&s;on, or upon tho&s;e who execute the laws, and whether it is that which falls within the denomi|nation of a libel.&mdash;As to that letter, if the Attorney General was to indict him to-morrow, he could make no defence again&s;t it; having &s;poken of the King, and wrote of him as wanting proper qualifications, and repre&s;enting the profligacy of the Royal Family, and that it was likely to produce evils, could he de|fend him&s;elf again&s;t that? Good God, gentlemen, it is impo&s;&s;ible! The que&s;tion will be for you, Whether this book, if you &s;hall not find it to be infected by that letter (which is written nine months &s;ince) falls within the &s;ame principles?&mdash;Gentlemen, I &s;tated to you the con&s;titution of this country, as e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by King, Lords, and Commons, is the con&s;ti|tution which I like, is the con&s;titution which I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee give way to any other; is the con&s;titution which has been productive of various bene|fits, and is the con&s;titution which I tru&s;t will be pro|ductive of many more, provided it does not carry in its form the &s;eeds of decay, or unle&s;s we have not wi&s;|dom
<PB N="61" REF="67">to prop it up.&mdash;I agree with the merchants that a&s;&s;embled in the city of London, and &s;hould have been happy to have &s;igned my name, and &s;hould have &s;ub&s;cribed to it, had I a proof that the Engli&s;h go|vernment is capable of reforming all the abu&s;es that belong to it, the abu&s;es that are here &s;tated, which is a clue t the mind of the man. I am defending a man whom I am not able to de&s;cribe, and that I am afraid we &s;hall hardly &s;ee again; and as it was truly ob&s;erved by Mr. Burke in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, when I &s;tated the pa&s;&s;age from the work of Dr. John&s;on, that it was a very wi&s;e &s;election, more than I or the &s;peaker could have found, I take it I &s;hall &s;till have more the lead when I refer you to the expre&s;&s;ions of Mr. Burke, where he gives the cha|racter of that great man, Sir George Saville. After &s;peaking of him in America, Gentlemen, (I am afraid I &s;hall hardly have &s;trength to go through my duty) as to the character of that great per&s;on we have unfortunately for many years lo&s;t, whether it would be attended with any benefit to the country, we mu&s;t hear from him&s;elf in the letter he publi&s;hed t his con&s;tituents, and to the whole world; not taking the con&s;titution of England in the ab&s;tract, or its formation of King, Lords, and Commons, in the ab&s;tract, but a direct account and explanation of his opinion concerning what was tran&s;acted by the Parliament of Great Britain, which for many years we were obliged to &s;ubmit to with hardly a ray of hope of &s;eeing a change. "I return to you" (&s;ays
<PB N="62" REF="68">Sir George Saville) <Q>baffled and di&s;pirited; and I am &s;orry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope of &s;eeing any change in the mi&s;erable cour&s;e of public calamities.</Q> Such were the thoughts of Sir George Saville; the con&s;e|quence we &s;aw. America, from being an obe|dient colony, not thinking as we profe&s;s to think of the Engli&s;h government, became a republic, ca&s;t off the yoke; and Mr. Paine, the Author, living at that time in America, and acting under the au&s;pices of Mr. Burke, who&s;e book brings him here, and if you read them together would give you an expla|nation of a multitude of pa&s;&s;ages. Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine walked in the &s;ame field of rea&s;oning to|gether; they &s;poke in different places. Mr. Burke &s;poke in the Parliament of England, &s;uch as that great &s;tate&s;man de&s;cribes it, who had no ears for &s;uch &s;ounds. Mr. Paine &s;poke to the people, rea&s;oned with them on their condition, told them no people could be bound to the &s;ubjection of any &s;overeignty further than their own benefit required. Mr. Burke &s;ays the&s;e arguments are unan&s;werable. The pam|phlet of Common Sen&s;e contains all the doctrines con|tained in the Rights of Man, calumniates the form of government, and attacks all the principles and corruptions of the Hou&s;es of Parliament, &s;hews their defects; &s;o does Mr. Burke him&s;elf in his letter to the Sheriff of Bri&s;tol; and it ju&s;tified the Americans in bringing about this happy and glorious revolu|tion. And I take upon me to aver at this moment,
<PB N="63" REF="69">there is as great a regard to property, le&s;s taxation, le&s;s grievances, le&s;s to deplore, and more to admire, in the con&s;titution of America, than in any other country, any other con&s;titution, any other govern|ment under Heaven. I will except none, except our own, and not that, unle&s;s it is purged, as it &s;oon will be,&mdash;purged of tho&s;e &s;pots which I tru&s;t will not de&s;troy wholly the vital parts, though they ob&s;cure them. Is not Mr. Paine to be believed becau&s;e he was the only one out of three millions that did not remain attached to the crown, and tells you that all the blood that was &s;hed in America was &s;hed by the crown of Great Britain, under the authority of Parliament? Such as Sir George Saville de&s;cribes it, and Mr. Burke de&s;cribes. He came over to this coun|try with a mind wholly republican. If you look to his pamphlet of Common Sen&s;e, he argues and builds his arguments upon what he has written before; and I &s;hould almo&s;t &s;ay he is a plagiary from him&s;elf, for it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man that writes one thing not to have the &s;ame thing in his mind. Now let us &s;ee what the American revolution in its con&s;e|quences produced. A revolution which has lately happened in Europe, and likely to make &s;o va&s;t a change upon the face of the earth,&mdash;how did that revolution ari&s;e? It was produced in con&s;equence of that incurable, corrupt, and profligate government that exi&s;ted in France. God forbid, when I &s;ay that corrupt and profligate government, that I &s;hould mean it as a &s;arca&s;m again&s;t that unfortunate Mo|narch,
<PB N="64" REF="70">who, for any thing that I know, at this mo|ment may be under affliction, and in a &s;ituation that grieves one to think of; no, it is not nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould do it; and I ca&s;t as little reflection upon that unfor|tunate Monarch, as I did when I &s;poke of this coun|try. I do not mean to be under&s;tood to treat the King not only with that duty and obedience which belongs to the &s;ubject, but to conduct my&s;elf to him with that ju&s;tice which I think belongs to him, and is due to his conduct from all men, either in public or private life. When I &s;peak of the&s;e abu&s;es and corruptions of our government, I &s;peak of that which the commentator upon our law has &s;tated &s;o particu|larly, and who&s;e book is put into the hands of every &s;tudent before he comes here. I mean that unfor|tunate want of fore&s;ight, as he expre&s;&s;es it, of our ance&s;tors. Why then, Gentlemen, can you &s;uppo&s;e that reverend Judge was a libeller upon the con&s;ti|tution of this country? He tells you it is from the want of fore&s;ight in our ance&s;tors: if it was &s;o, let the fore&s;ight of po&s;terity prevent tho&s;e con&s;equences, and take them into con&s;ideration; for it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pull down a whole building becau&s;e there happens to be a few of the tiles loo&s;e; it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pull down the whole &s;tructure. Then comes Mr. Paine at the time the French revolution took place. I am now &s;peaking to you of that which is within the reach of your own knowledge, at the time the French revolution had taken place in that coun|try, that the Ba&s;tille was de&s;troyed, that the King
<PB N="65" REF="71">had been pulled down, and had, by his own con|&s;ent, become the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the people:&mdash; that had no manner of effect on this country: it would not have had any effect, had it not occurred to that celebrated per&s;on who&s;e name I before men|tioned, to provoke a &s;ubject, and which, if it were dangerous to di&s;cu&s;s, he led the way to it. I tru&s;t it is not to be endured, that the human mind is to be put in fetters: I tru&s;t it does not belong to him, or any other man, to give us our le&s;&s;on, and to &s;ay, this &s;hall be your creed, and that we &s;hall not think for our&s;elves. He has done that; and, in my opinion, more dangerou&s;ly di&s;torted the principles of our go|vernment. I &s;ay, if it be a libel for any man to mi&s;|take the con&s;titution, or to put it upon the footing that will tend to de&s;troy it, Mr. Burke is that libel|ler. But when I &s;ay Mr. Burke is that libeller, I do not mean that he is an object of criminal ju&s;tice, be|cau&s;e I can have no right to make him &s;o. I do not mean, when I am defending the motives of one man, to criminate the motives of another; but I will put the ca&s;e upon it, and you will find that in the pre|face, and the introduction, and in the whole body of the work. Now I will give it you from Mr. Burke him&s;elf. It happened, Gentlemen, when the French revolution pulled down de&s;poti&s;m, a great number of per&s;ons felt an intere&s;t in the event, &mdash;an intere&s;t well worthy of Engli&s;hmen: they &s;aw the fall of a government that had long been the &s;courge of Great Britain, and which had led to a
<PB N="66" REF="72">long, cruel, and de&s;olating war, from its pernicious government, they &s;aw that de&s;poti&s;m humbled to the ground; and a gentleman who is now no more, a reverend divine, knowing that the i&s;&s;ues of a hu|man life are in the hands of God, thought it a mat|ter of ju&s;t congratulation even from the pulpit, and reminded the people of this country of the glorious deliverance, and the advantages ari&s;ing from that revolution. Gentlemen, it is Dr. Price I &s;peak of. It happened al&s;o, that a &s;ociety of gentlemen, at the time when France was a neutral nation, and under their con&s;titution the monarch was going in triumph, and amid&s;t the crowds of his fellow-citi|zens, over and over again, to give a&s;&s;ent to that which his oath had given &s;anction, to that &s;y&s;tem, be|cau&s;e in the opinion of a very few, for Mr. Burke, very unwi&s;ely I think, makes it a &s;arca&s;tic matter of reproach upon the in&s;ignificance and the &s;mallne&s;s of the body of men, and that their names were never heard of till that moment; he thought it a matter for his eloquence to whip tho&s;e &s;courges of faction to their kennels, and I take upon me to aver, there was no pro&s;ecution, no charge, no man was brought forth as a di&s;affected &s;ubject, there was no &s;courge of oppo&s;ition, but he invents this &s;uppo&s;ed &s;chi&s;m, in order to give the King a title which he has not from any body but Mr. Burke, and which, I am &s;ure, it would be his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t &s;olemn intere&s;t to deny. Mr. Burke, by the bye, cites two-thirds of this work, and no man is to put in a reply; a man is to put
<PB N="67" REF="73">government on what footing he plea&s;es; a man is to take parts of my book, whatever he plea&s;es, and I am not to an&s;wer it, but I am to be tied up from the common right which he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf. He &s;ays they are ma&s;ters of the commonwealth; the French revolution, &s;ay they, was the act of the ma|jority of the people; the people of England, for in|&s;tance, wi&s;h to make the &s;ame change, and have the &s;ame right, &s;o &s;ays Mr. Burke, that is to &s;ay, none at all. Gentlemen, if we have been in&s;ane for cen|turies, as the Attorney General has &s;aid, and that it would be to the advantage of this country to throw off the pre&s;ent government, that the people of Eng|land cannot do it, for God's &s;ake let that &s;entiment never be uttered, and I deny, and I firmly deny it; if it be &s;o, for God Almighty's &s;ake, let policy and wi&s;dom conceal it, and you had better furni&s;h every body with a copy of Mr. Paine's book, and tell him to write to the public, than put that book of Mr. Burke's into the hands of every man. Say to a man, look at that con&s;titution; it came down form gene|ration to generation&mdash;there it is; it was a glorious &s;truggle that gave it you; there are &s;ome ob&s;curities upon it; the &s;ame wi&s;dom that gave it you, pre&s;erves it; it is your own, will you have it or not; what is the an&s;wer? Yes, I will keep it. But if I tell a man it is packed upon your back as a bea&s;t of burden, you mu&s;t carry it whether you will have it or not; it is not what your ance&s;tors gave you; remember, I do not affect to &s;ay, you or I may &s;tir up rebellion, it is
<PB N="68" REF="74">merely my opinion, and may be the opinion of any man; it is like drawing up a curtain before a man that is confined in the dark. I will &s;hew you that Mr. Paine is not &s;peaking upon the con&s;titution, but merely an&s;wering Mr. Burke; he is denying Mr. Burke's principles, which are more dangerous than any that every came from the Engli&s;h pre&s;s. What is the revolution? That his Maje&s;ty undoubt|edly is not an elective monarch; but was it not the people of England that elected King William to the throne? What will Mr. Attorney General &s;ay to me? I am arraigning my client for faying, it was the vention of the people of England who got toge|ther, the Lord knows how, and &s;ent for King Wil|liam. If that convention did not affect to have the forms of law, it was called the Convention Parlia|ment. Did they give it to him in the line of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion? Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales, and might they not, as Mr. Ju&s;tice Black&s;tone expre&s;sly &s;ays they might, have given it to any other family? To be &s;ure they might; and he puts it upon the footing, that it was the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors to depart no further from the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It was a matter of di&s;cretion, and I maintain it to be the be&s;t title, and long may the King and his family live under it; they &s;hall have my vote for its continuance, and it is the be&s;t way to live in the affections of the people; and it is not in the power of man to &s;tir the con&s;titution of any country, but from the default of the government; nor is it from any libels that may
<PB N="69" REF="75">be written upon the con&s;titution. Mr. Burke is plea&s;ed to &s;ay &s;o in his <Q>Thoughts upon the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents;</Q> he thinks fit to &s;peak upon tho&s;e parts of the government for which Mr. Paine is arraigned for &s;peaking upon. And I will &s;hew that when I come to that grand part that brought me here to &s;peak to you, that is, the limits, authority, and the liberty of the pre&s;s. Now let us &s;ee whether there be others that differ from us and every right of the people to change their govern|ment; to know they can change, and to circulate it among them that they can change, my learned friend will find it difficult to fa&s;ten the character of a libeller upon a gentleman who&s;e work lays before me. Here I &s;hall begin with a modern author; I have the ho|nour of my learned friend's per&s;onal acquaintance; he is a man, perhaps, more devoted to the real con|&s;titution of his country, as will be found from many parts of his work, than almo&s;t any man I am ac|quainted with. He is a man of great learning; I mean Mr. Paley, Archdeacon of Carli&s;le, in a work, entitled, "Principles of Moral and Political Philo|&s;ophy." Gentlemen, he is di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this point, which was not thought dangerous the other day, and I hope we &s;hall get over this ridiculous panic that makes us think that dangerous where no danger is in it. If the government of this country, like the Chri&s;|tian religion, be of God, it will &s;tand; if not, we can|not prevent it from coming to nothing. He was di&s;cu&s;&s;ing and thinking of the government of this
<PB N="70" REF="76">country, and he begins with differing from Mr. Locke, not throughout, but in part, upon the foot|ing of a compact. You will &s;ee how different Mr. Burke &s;peaks from Mr. Locke; it is admirable &s;en&s;e, and goes more to give one the true notion of go|vernment, than any book, and I &s;hould wi&s;h the at|tention of every body in this Court to it. Mr. Paley &s;ays, re&s;pecting the inconvenience of a compact, he thought it dangerous to call it a compact, for if broken ever &s;o little, it is contrary to the will of God, who&s;e will is paramount to all others; he then &s;tates this, which, I think, differs a little from the principles of my learned friend. <Q>No u&s;age, law, or authority whatever, is &s;o binding, that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be changed with advantage to the community. The family of the prince, the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the prerogative of the crown, the form and parts of legi&s;lature, together with the re&s;pective powers, office, dura|tion, and mutual dependency of the &s;everal parts, are all only &s;o many laws, mutable like other laws; whenever expediency requires, either by the ordinary act of the legi&s;lature, or if the occa&s;ion de&s;erve it, by the interpo&s;ition of the people.</Q> No man can &s;ay this gentleman wi&s;hed to infu&s;e di&s;|content into this country. If you fa&s;ten a govern|ment upon a man again&s;t his con&s;ent, and he has an inclination to get rid of it, if be do not like it, and other people approve of it, he will go out of the country; if all people di&s;approve it, they will make it

<P>Mr. Attorney General &s;ays Mr. Paine di&s;likes the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; he has a right, and I will &s;hew you the wi&s;dom and policy of the Engli&s;h law pre|vents a man being &s;ubject to a pro&s;ecution for it, and you will &s;ee I do not make u&s;e of my own au|thority when I make u&s;e of that expre&s;&s;ion. Gentle|men, Mr. Locke &s;ays, and perhaps his might be a libel al&s;o, though he was an affectionate &s;ervant to King William, high in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate; he wrote before King William was warm upon the throne; and, holding a high &s;ituation, he puts it upon the very &s;ame footing, when he wrote in an&s;wer to Sir Robert Filmer, as Mr. Paine writes to Mr.
<PB N="72" REF="78">Burke: what does it &s;ignify a fig, whether a king exi&s;t by divine rights, or whether it is from a com|pact which cannot be altered; whether it be from &s;omething ari&s;ing from God or man does not alter the que&s;tion. Mr. Locke puts it upon the footing Mr. Paley does.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney General &s;ays, the fir&s;t parts of the Rights of Man being among the judicious cla&s;&s;es of the community, he does not fear concerning it; but when it de&s;cended and was circulated in the lower order, there the evil begins. It may be &s;aid, the people being ignorant and di&s;contented was the cau&s;e. To this I an&s;wer quite the contrary; and if there be defects introduced by time or corruption, it is not an ea&s;y thing to change them; and it is univer&s;al throughout the world; &s;o you ob&s;erve. I have two autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ties which I have &s;tated, be&s;ides an authority I will read that is more in point, the authority of Mr. Burke him&s;elf; which &s;hews the footing upon which he puts it is not that principle upon which the government can &s;afely &s;tand. He &s;ays, <Q>the di&s;po|&s;ition of the people of America is aver&s;e to any other than a free government, and this is indica|tion enough to any hone&s;t &s;tate&s;man how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their ca&s;e. If any a&s;k me what a free government is? I an&s;wer, that, for any practical purpo&s;e, it is what the people think &s;o; and that they, and not I, are the natural, lawful, and competent judges of this matter. If they practically allow me a
<PB N="73" REF="79">greater degree of authority over them than is con|&s;i&s;tent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for &s;o great a tru&s;t; and not to endeavour to prove from thence that they have rea&s;oned ami&s;s, and that, having gone &s;o far by analogy, they mu&s;t hereafter have no enjoyment but my plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am &s;orry to feel my&s;elf con&s;iderably con&s;umed in &s;trength before I have arrived at what I conceive to be the material object for your con&s;idera|tion. All I have &s;tated has been to lead you to think there is not that novelty in Mr. Paine's opinions&mdash;I have &s;hewn how they grew up in his life&mdash;how his hi&s;tory led to it&mdash;how his &s;ituation under General Wa&s;hington led him to be a republican in belief, and, being &s;o, gave him an opportunity of writing what he believed to be the defects of the Engli&s;h govern|ment. I do not mean to put the defence of my cau&s;e upon the exi&s;tence of abu&s;es. I have &s;tated tho&s;e authors for the rea&s;on of &s;hewing you the nature of the liberty of the pre&s;s, and I &s;hall not be mortified in the lea&s;t, or dejected, or put down from what I feel to be my own &s;entiments re&s;pecting the liberty of the pre&s;s. If I &s;hould not meet with the approba|tion of the court in what I &s;tate, I &s;hall go out of court mo&s;t undoubtedly with a belief of what I know is well founded, that is, that the liberty of the pre&s;s is as it occurs to you who are to decide it; but I have opportunities of &s;eeing before now, and it ought to make us cautious before we condemn a man by bell,
<PB N="74" REF="80">book, and candle. It was but a year ago I had the opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing you upon &s;ome of the&s;e ideas, and, notwith&s;tanding Mr. Attorney General may &s;ay this is peculiarly for your con&s;ideration, you will remember your authority to judge of it is but a year old, and I &s;hould be very &s;orry, in the infancy of your juri&s;diction, it &s;hould be arraigned. I wi&s;h to exclude his Lord&s;hip, and wi&s;h he &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf wholly out of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when I had le&s;s to &s;upport me, le&s;s &s;trength, le&s;s knowledge, and le&s;s acquaintance with tho&s;e &s;tanding around me, I remember not being treated with contempt or unkindne&s;s by Lord Man&s;|field (for he always treated me with regard and ten|derne&s;s); with his mighty mind, enlightened with all the learning that belongs to the highe&s;t elevated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> laughed at me, as one laughing at an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> prattle, when I ventured to &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the con&s;titution, that a man was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> with a verdict the moment the publi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">on was proved. Therefore, Gentlemen, let us be cautious when we &s;ee men on a &s;udden changing their opinions &s;o entirely. We find the whole par|liament unanimous that I was in the right, though &s;o often in the wrong before; and I mu&s;t feel that it is a great le&s;&s;on of caution, to be careful before we con|demn others, knowing that it is by &s;low and painful degrees that all the rights of the world have made them&s;elves known. If Mr. Burke is right in his prin|ciples of government, that the people cannot change
<PB N="75" REF="81">it, then I am wrong; for no man alive can write about government at all, or the rights of the people, as they have no juri&s;diction whatever. But if the people may change the government upon the genu|ine principles of government, they are a competent juri&s;diction; and therefore Mr. Paine has, <HI>bona fide,</HI> wrote for the con&s;ideration of the whole people of England, whether the government of England is right of wrong, whether it is &s;ubject to the&s;e imper|fections. Mr. Attorney General thinks that Mr. Paine wrote the many things he has here wrote without the&s;e imperfections exi&s;ting; but his habit of life throughout &s;hew that he wrote to the whole nation. Now let us &s;ee what has been the ca&s;e, and I will give you &s;ome awful authorities of the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, and the civilization of government, from the earlie&s;t accounts to this time; and then you will &s;ee if we &s;hould not have been in the woods, with dreadful ignorance, whether religious or poli|tical, if every man had been condemned as a crimi|nal who had dared to advance any doctrine upon government. Are men to ari&s;e at no change or per|fection but by the blood ab&s;olutely of the inno|cent? Gentlemen, I am defending an humble in|dividual, and it is &s;aid of him he is only ad|dicted to con&s;ider religious topics when drunk; but I am &s;tanding for a much more valuable object, the liberty of the pre&s;s.&mdash;That I may know my condemnation may not go with it, and that I may not be criminal to-morrow, let us &s;ee
<PB N="76" REF="82">what the cour&s;e of the world has been with re&s;pect to the di&s;&s;emination of truth; let it be remembered that the univer&s;al God that created us was one of the fir&s;t martyrs to the di&s;&s;emination of truth; that he came with that divine qualification; that the Saviour of the world expired upon the cro&s;s for &s;tating that which was the object of &s;corn to all tho&s;e that it was &s;tated to; his ble&s;&s;ed followers experienced the &s;ame fate.&mdash;Why did they follow the &s;ame fate? Our Sa|viour might have done like the Mahometan Prophet, he might have come and promulgated that which was growing by &s;low degrees; he might have &s;pread it at once over the whole world by deva&s;tation and con|que&s;t: he came to confound the pride of man, and he came to preach up tho&s;e univer&s;al and equal rights which are the great privileges of mankind in every age of the world; he came therefore in that low e&s;tate he is repre&s;ented, and preached his doctrines and his con&s;olations to the poor. We find, &s;ub&s;equent to that time, as the conver&s;ion to the Church began, political power, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, going hand in hand, making havock throughout the world, beating down truth, and wounding by ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, till the revival of letters and learn|ing began to advance upon the world. You will find &s;uper&s;tition advancing the &s;econd time. Gentle|men, if you &s;ee in what manner the liberty of the pre&s;s began in this country, or rather at what time its freedom was fir&s;t abridged; if you will look into the books of the law, you will find no man puni&s;hed,
<PB N="77" REF="83">or puni&s;hable, for the propagation of opinion, till the erection of the Star Chamber, in the year 1637. Now I admit the &s;afety of every community ought to be the rule; there is no country but mu&s;t take care of its own &s;afety; and if my learned friend can &s;hew to me that the &s;afety of this country depends on the &s;peaking of the freedom of the people, that it is im|plicated in the freedom of all principles of govern|ment, then I &s;hall admit the freedom of the law &s;hould pur&s;ue this gentleman. Has it that effect? Gentlemen, during the time the pre&s;s was laid under fetters; during the time it was made &s;ubject to a li|cen&s;e that no man &s;hould print a work unle&s;s he had a licen&s;e, and until he had the authority of the &s;tate; during the &s;hort period, which was but for eleven years, that that government la&s;ted, all the authority of the government was coming to ruin, and terminated with that foul cata&s;trophe and tragedy, the death of King Charles the Fir&s;t; that is to &s;ay, in the igno|rance of the people in preventing freedom of com|munication. It is the freedom of communication that prevents evil; let men communicate their &s;en|timents to one another, it is like fire &s;cattered on the ground, or like gunpowder &s;cattered on the &s;urface of the earth; it communicates, but the explo&s;ion is not heard: keep it under con&s;traint, it is like gunpowder compre&s;&s;ed, and like &s;ubterraneous fire, who&s;e agitation is un&s;een till it bur&s;ts into an earth|quake. Let argument be oppo&s;ed by argument, and rea&s;on be oppo&s;ed to rea&s;on, and the country is
<PB N="78" REF="84">&s;afe. In the time of Oliver Cromwell it was the &s;ame; in the reign of Charles the Second, how &s;oon was that done away by a revolution; all tho&s;e cob|webs were &s;wept away, all were de&s;troyed, and the country has la&s;ted for a century without them; the vital parts of the con&s;titution have been pre&s;erved; the freedom of writing and &s;peaking have been in|culcated, and the nation has been &s;afe. Gentle|men, I will &s;tate to you &s;ome writers of great autho|rity on this &s;ubject; and here I would humbly &s;ug|ge&s;t to his Lord&s;hip, that in a ca&s;e of this &s;ort it is impo&s;&s;ible to give authorities, and go to books of the law, with the &s;ame preci&s;ion as we look for autho|rities in ca&s;es of particular de&s;cription; as if, for in&s;tance, the que&s;tion be, whether an individual be guilty of &s;lander, and we go to books to &s;ee what had been con&s;idered &s;lander by the law of England: but in a &s;ubject of this &s;ort you can go no where but to the &s;en&s;e and opinion of the jury, and that &s;en&s;e is to be taken and compared with what has been written by one individual, with what in general is tolerated throughout the realm. I know, if I was to &s;tate to my Lord, that twenty men had written twenty things libellous, and not &s;hewing this is not one, he might &s;ay, that does not &s;hew your client has not written one. If you will read matter written by other people, which is reprehen&s;ible, &s;hew libels in the writings of men that are con&s;idered as cla&s;&s;ics in the language, which are &s;uffered to be printed and reprinted, cer|tainly
<PB N="79" REF="85">tainly that ob&s;ervation will not ari&s;e. Gentlemen, I will read to you what is written by a per&s;on mo&s;t un|doubtedly of the mo&s;t &s;ublime genius; and not only that, but a man of the greate&s;t virtues; a per&s;on whom I am &s;ure my learned friend will think at lea&s;t a great authority in point of learning, however he might be of opinion he was a Republican and Leveller in his writings and principles; it only &s;hews that a man may be a Republican and a good man, as mo&s;t undoubtedly that man was. Gentlemen, I &s;peak of the poet Mil|ton, who wrote in the beginning of the Common|wealth again&s;t the act made by Oliver Cromwell's parliament, to tie up the liberty of the pre&s;s. Mr. Attorney General may &s;ay, and &s;o far he will &s;ay with truth, there is a difference between a previous di&s;tinc|tion and puni&s;hment for an overt act which is com|mitted while the pre&s;s is free; undoubtedly there is one great di&s;tinction, but in my humble opinion, if every thing is to be judged a libel that does not fall within the principles of the government of the country in what was written, it would be infinitely better there &s;hould be a licen&s;er than not. If I pub|li&s;h under a licen&s;e, I do it with authority, and pub|li&s;h with &s;afety. I &s;end my book to a magi&s;trate, who is to judge and examine its contents; if he di&s;|approves it, I will withdraw it; if he approves it, I am &s;afe; for if a licen&s;er is appointed by govern|ment, he mu&s;t judge of the book I pre&s;ent to his, and he mu&s;t approve it before I can publi&s;h it: but if there is no magi&s;trate appointed by the law of Eng|land
<PB N="80" REF="86">the pre&s;s is free in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and every man may &s;ay and publi&s;h as he plea&s;es. It is ma|terial certainly that every man &s;hould know upon what principle that judgment &s;hould be formed; for if that judgment is to be formed upon the jury not being of the &s;ame opinion with the writer, no man would venture or dare to put his mind on paper upon any &s;ubject in the world: therefore it depends on the principles on which he wrote, and what were the purpo&s;es of his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Milton mentions Gallileo. Now when Milton &s;aw Gallileo, he was confined, becau&s;e, upon &s;eeing the pha&s;es of Venus in the tele&s;cope, he em|braced the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, and was led to believe that the &s;un was in the center of that &s;y&s;tem. He ended his illu&s;trious life in pri&s;on for only &s;tating the &s;un to be in the center of that &s;y&s;tem, which we all now know it is, and which enables us to extend our navigation to the furthe&s;t corners of the world, and to carry our line and rule to the dimen&s;ions of the works of the Great God; yet for tho&s;e truths you find that man was condemned by the inqui&s;ition for an opinion of his own, becau&s;e it was different from the confined ideas of the days in which he lived. Gentlemen, remember I am not bringing you to think or believe, though we may think hereafter, or more probably &s;hall think here|after, that the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is inferior to the con&s;titution which my client approves; but it is enough for my argument that it is &s;peculatively he &s;peaks of it in the an&s;wer to the book which puts
<PB N="81" REF="87">the different parts of magi&s;tracy in a different manner to which he thought it &s;hould be put. Gentlemen, there is another author, who&s;e opinion concerning the liberty of the pre&s;s perhaps you may think more in point; he was an authority living much nearer our own times; he is a man who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be carrying liberty farther than it ought to be; a man that held the highe&s;t and mo&s;t enlarged princi|ples of government. I &s;peak of Mr. Hume; and he con&s;iders this liberty of the pre&s;s, finding fault with the con&s;titution, as the grand &s;ource of the liberty of the country: tho&s;e grand principles account for the great liberty of the pre&s;s in England, by which all the wit, genius, and learning of the nation, may be employed on the &s;ide of freedom, and every one may write his own &s;entiments. Gentlemen, this doctrine &s;eems to me cut down and paired to no|thing; for if I cannot write again&s;t the forms of the Engli&s;h government, then I cannot write again&s;t any part of it, I cannot find fault with it, I cannot &s;ay the King's Bench ought to be abrogated, I cannot &s;peak again&s;t the Court of Chancery; I cannot, in &s;hort, make any one remark which would tend to make any alteration in the con&s;titution or govern|ment. There are two other authorities that I will cite to you on the &s;ubject; they are both of them Peers of Parliament, and therefore judges of the law: one of them is a lawyer high in the admini&s;tration of magi&s;tracy, and the other is no longer living, but made a &s;plendid appearance while member in the
<PB N="82" REF="88">Upper Hou&s;e of Parliament, and was attached mo&s;t unque&s;tionably to the King, as he held an high of|fice under the King at the time he wrote this: I &s;peak of the Earl of Che&s;terfield. <Q>There is the diffi|culty of di&s;tingui&s;hing between liberty and licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s; one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings people can enjoy is liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lord Kenyon.</HI> I believe the writer of the life of Dr. John&s;on &s;peaks of that very &s;peech, and claims that part.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Er&s;kine.</HI> It is extremely true; Lord Che&s;ter|field is &s;uppo&s;ed to borrow that which I am now about to &s;tate.&mdash;<HI>Lord Kenyon.</HI> That very &s;peech was writ|ten by Dr. John&s;on.&mdash;<HI>Mr. Er&s;kine.</HI> If that is &s;o, it certainly places me higher than I had any right to place my&s;elf. Though Lord Che&s;terfield was a great and ingenious wit, he certainly was far lower, and inferior in under&s;tanding and in monarchical writing, than the celebrated writer to whom my Lord has now alluded. If ever there was a man that profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an enemy to any thing that looked like po|litical freedom, if ever there was a man that would knock down with a hammer every thing that had it, it was Doctor John&s;on; therefore I am much obliged to his Lord&s;hip for his information. He &s;ays one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a man can enjoy is liberty; for there is &s;uch a connection between licentiou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, that it is not ea&s;y to correct the one without dangerou&s;ly wounding the other. It is extremely
<PB N="83" REF="89">hard to di&s;tingui&s;h the true limit between them; like a changeable &s;ilk, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee there are two different colours, but we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover where the one ends or where the other begins. He concludes that arbitrary power has &s;eldom or ever been introduced; and I confe&s;s my&s;elf much obliged to his Lord&s;hip for giving this pa&s;&s;age to Dr. John&s;on. Gentlemen, I confe&s;s I cannot help agree|ing with the learned author of this ob&s;ervation. My learned friend, who has ju&s;t now gone out of court, has not given you any principle; he has not told you what it is a man may not &s;afely write, if this parti|cular book is condemned. If indeed it is true that a man did contemplate the mi&s;ery of the people of Great Britain, and thought as you and I do upon the government, he might think this book was writ|ten with an evil intention; but mo&s;t probably he did not think of it as we do. I &s;hould be glad to know how much &s;hort of what Mr. Paine has written any man may write. May I &s;ay a republic is a better thing than a monarchy? May I &s;ay this con&s;titution would be better without a Hou&s;e of Lords? Is there any language in which I may expre&s;s tho&s;e &s;enti|ments, or does a libel con&s;i&s;t in the &s;aucy manner in which the &s;entiment is expre&s;&s;ed; If &s;o, where is the boundary to be drawn? How am I to know when I am within the limits of the pre&s;s or not?</P>
<P>I think there is a noble per&s;on I have de&s;cribed, who&s;e mind is not turned to introduce di&s;order into the &s;tate, or extend the privileges of the public be|yond
<PB N="84" REF="90">what the law now is; I mean Lord Loughbo|rough, Chief Ju&s;tice of the Court of Common Pleas. I believe I can an&s;wer for the correctne&s;s of this. My Lord Loughborough gives this opinion, and I &s;hall follow it up with an authority of the Earl of Stan|hope; as I may overlook it, I will take that fir&s;t. He &s;ays, with great &s;hrewdne&s;s, after alluding to what fell from Lord Loughborough, <Q>The thing that is illegal, is the exciting any one to &s;edition, or to a breach of the peace. The que&s;tion therefore upon a libel is, whether a paper publi&s;hed did thus excite, and was &s;o intended; con&s;equently, mere &s;peculative writings on the con&s;titution are not libels, however ab&s;urd they may be. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that a man were to write a &s;pecula|tive work to prove, that a trial by a &s;ingle judge would be far preferable to the trial by jury; or that a Parliament, compo&s;ed only of a King and Hou&s;e of Peers, would be, beyond compari&s;on, better than the legi&s;lature of King, Lords, and Com|mons; no man could po&s;&s;ibly reprobate &s;uch a work more than I &s;hould: but if the work did not excite people to &s;edition, &s;uch a &s;peculative pub|lication could certainly never be deemed a libel, for ab&s;urdity is no part of the definition of a libel. If our boa&s;ted liberty of the pre&s;s were to con&s;i&s;t only in the liberty to write in prai&s;e of the con|&s;titution, that is a liberty enjoyed under many an arbitrary government. I &s;uppo&s;e it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offence, even by
<PB N="85" REF="91">the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, if any man were to take it into his head to write a panegyric upon the Ru&s;&s;ian form of government; &s;uch a liberty as that might therefore properly be called the Ru&s;&s;ian liberty of the pre&s;s; but the Engli&s;h liberty of the pre&s;s is of a very different de&s;cription, for by the law of England it is not prohibited to publi&s;h &s;peculative works upon the con&s;titution, whether they contain prai&s;e or cen&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The liberty of the pre&s;s is of ine&s;timable value, for without it this nation might &s;oon be as thorough|ly en&s;laved, as France was, or as Turkey is; every man who dete&s;ts the whole government of France, and the pre&s;ent government of Turkey, mu&s;t be therefore earne&s;t to &s;ecure that palladium of liber|ty, and mu&s;t al&s;o be anxious to pre&s;erve to the people inviolate the trial by jury, that tran&s;cend|ent, that incomparable and guardian right.</Q> There|fore you &s;ee, Gentlemen, as far at lea&s;t as general principle goes, we have ideas in the opinions of per&s;ons; if this is not true, the noble Lord is writ|ing a libel him&s;elf, for exciting people to do all the&s;e things contrary to the law made by the upper hou&s;e of Parliament. Now, Gentlemen, as to Lord Loughborough's opinion, if I was to read it, I be|lieve it would be correct. Now, Gentlemen, you ob&s;erve, if Mr. Attorney General had meant to &s;ay, if Mr. Paine had written the&s;e ob&s;ervations upon the Engli&s;h government, as I will &s;hew you other men have made the &s;ame ob&s;ervations upon both hou&s;es
<PB N="86" REF="92">of Parliament; if he had done it, as the Attorney General &s;ays, not extending the circulation of it by acts of his own; he has put no &s;uch fact upon re|cord, there is no evidence of it; he has not charged any particular circum&s;tance or act of the Defendant antecedent to writing this book; he has &s;hewn you no declaration of his contrary to tho&s;e of a good &s;ubject; he has &s;hewn you no conver&s;ation which marked him to &s;ay by and bye we &s;hall &s;ee confu|sion in England, and &s;uch de&s;truction as is going on in France. I would give up my brief if it was &s;o, for it would give the lie to his preface; it would have &s;hewn he did not addre&s;s him&s;elf to the uni|ver&s;al rea&s;on of the people of England, but that he thought to introduce mi&s;ery among the various cla&s;&s;es of mankind in this country. Gentlemen, therefore I &s;tand before you upon this ground, which brings me to remark upon the pa&s;&s;ages, and then I have done. I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, becau&s;e when I con&s;ider the nature of the human mind, how much I have to &s;truggle again&s;t in your opinions, and know you are anxious to retire from the con&s;idera|tion of the bu&s;ine&s;s, I know your ju&s;tice will indulge me with the hearing of what it is my duty to &s;tate to you. I &s;tand at this bar for the purpo&s;e of giving a criminal arraigned before you that defence which the law entitles him to; if any part is incon&s;i&s;tent, my Lord will &s;top me; if any thing is improper, if it can be an&s;wered, or if it is &s;o clear in your mind as not to require any, your verdict will in a mo|ment
<PB N="87" REF="93">overthrow all that I have been &s;aying,&mdash;Our duties are of the mo&s;t different nature in the world; you will di&s;charge your duty while I di&s;|charge mine: it is not mine to judge, but to lay the materials before you to judge; the &s;ame right any man has Mr. Paine has. When my Lord and I were engaged together in 1780, I do not imagine we were con&s;idered as contending for the propriety of a&s;&s;aulting the Hou&s;e of Commons, or putting the city of London into a conflagration; I am doing that to day which my Lord and I did in court to|gether then. What I am doing now is in expectation of ju&s;tice; and his Lord&s;hip, I have no doubt, will think no di&s;grace or obloquy that any man can &s;tate, &s;hould be thrown out again&s;t me for having done my duty in the manner I have done it. Some have &s;tated that I am zealous from di&s;affection; others, that I am &s;olicitous to &s;hew my abilities from vanity: though, if there were any &s;ituation which would forbid a man to do it, it mu&s;t be this, when he is to contend, and obliged to &s;peak, again&s;t the mo&s;t innate feelings of the mind; when he is ob|liged, by looking round, to &s;ee &s;o many counte|nances expre&s;&s;ing no very great &s;en&s;e of approbation at what he is maintaining with all his &s;trength, and feels his duty, and &s;hall to the late&s;t hour of his breath, and hopes to maintain that &s;trength and col|lection &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport &s;o painful, laborious, and unplea&s;ant a duty, as my &s;ituation calls upon me to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="94">Gentlemen, I come now, and then I have fini&s;h|ed, which will not be long, and &s;hall relieve you from the pain of hearing me any longer, to ob&s;erve upon the pa&s;&s;ages in this book. I am &s;ure, to every candid mind, it will operate as an excu&s;e. If I had &s;et about commenting upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages without having laid a foundation for my arguments by au|thorities wrote by other per&s;ons, you could not have under&s;tood the text; and I know it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have received any attention from you if I had not done &s;o; you would have gone out of the court and &s;aid, as lovers of the con&s;titution, &s;hall we not condemn this man?&mdash;I tell you I expect your verdict upon no &s;uch foundation. If you were called upon by truth and ju&s;tice to give a verdict, I &s;hould think you might &s;ay, we are of opinion that the King, Lords, and Commons, are not only in the original con&s;titution the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed government, and the mo&s;t beneficial, but we believe none of the corruptions &s;tated are in it, and we acquit the De|fendant becau&s;e he thought otherwi&s;e, and did it without looking to any particular magi&s;trate; and that the&s;e critici&s;ms did not apply to any particular per&s;on in the country. If that appears upon the face of your judgment, then I &s;ay the public is not in|jured, and the liberty of the pre&s;s is not wounded through any man's &s;ide; but if you tran&s;gre&s;s tho&s;e bounds laid down by the policy of the law, you make a &s;nare for others; therefore all I &s;eek for is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that principle, leaving you to
<PB N="89" REF="95">compare the facts, and &s;ee whether they have any ap|plication. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall do it away in a moment: it &s;ays, <Q>All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable or unheritable throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation than that mankind are he|ritable property. To inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>Is it to be endured, &s;ays the Attorney General, the people are to be told they are like &s;o many &s;heep and oxen?</P>
<P>Certainly not. I am of opinion, a more danger|ous doctrine cannot be in&s;tilled into the people of England. Mr. Paine is not doing that, when he &s;tates they are like flocks and herds; he is writing in an&s;wer to Mr. Burke's book, that a&s;&s;erts the he|reditary monarchy is fa&s;tened on the people, without any con&s;ent of their own. But, &s;ays Mr. Payne, I deny that that is the con&s;titution of England: the King is the magi&s;trate of the people, how then can you inherit them? the King, Lords, and Commons repre&s;ent the people, and can confer the throne upon his Lord&s;hip, or you or me: they repre&s;ent the whole people of England, and therefore, &s;ays Mr. Paine, there is no &s;uch King as you repre&s;ent inhe|riting the people by ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, or <Q>that to inherit a government is to inherit the people as if they were flocks and herds.</Q> And &s;o Mr. Locke
<PB N="90" REF="96">expre&s;&s;es it. No man can con&s;ent further for him|&s;elf; for he &s;ays no man, by any compact whatever, can bind his children or po&s;terity. So &s;ays Locke, and &s;o &s;ays Paine; therefore it is not the King of England, it is the King of France, it is the Emperor, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; it is all tho&s;e monarchs that are fa&s;tened upon their unwilling &s;ubjects; therefore, he &s;ays, that &s;pecies of inheritance to inherit the people, is it not binding? But if I my|&s;elf am the &s;hepherd, does any body inherit me like a flock? If I by my free con&s;ent give up my liberty, nobody is to blame: I am the guardian and pro|tector of the government. I may be wrong in attack|ing the foundation of the Briti&s;h government, but am not wrong in &s;aying Mr. Burke &s;ays it: therefore Mr. Paine contradicts Mr. Burke in his explanation of an heritable crown; he is di&s;tingui&s;hing the King of England, as he ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that title, the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant to fa&s;ten upon a prince: he con&s;iders him as a Maje&s;ty of the people, and therefore not inheriting us like herds and flocks; therefore I think this pa&s;&s;age is out of the ca&s;e entirely.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the next is, what I think extraordi|nary, my learned friend from page 21 leaps over to page 47, and begins in the&s;e words: "This con|vention,"&mdash;you will &s;ee what convention he is &s;peak|ing of; he is making a compari&s;on between the con|vention of America and that which took place on the Revolution in France&mdash;he &s;ays this <Q>convention
<PB N="91" REF="97">met at Philadelphia, in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected Pre&s;ident:&mdash;he he was not at that time connected with any of the &s;tate-governments or with Congre&s;s; he delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then lived a private citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Convention went deeply into all the &s;ub|jects; and having, after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation agreed among them&s;elves, upon the &s;everal parts of a federal con&s;titution; the next question was the manner of giving it authority and practice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this purpo&s;e they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector; but they referred the whole mat|ter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q></P>
<P>Now Gentlemen, I apprehend, whether King Wil|liam was brought over here by the &s;ounde&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t motives of the whole people acting for them|&s;elves, or whether he was brought over here by tho&s;e motives which very frequently have a &s;hare in the mo&s;t refined e&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;ignifies not a farthing; the author of the Commentaries upon our laws warns us not to fix our regard or obedience to the government; but con&s;idering the motives of our ance&s;tors that e&s;tabli&s;hed them, it is enough that it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. I &s;hould love the con&s;titution of the country ju&s;t as much, and be as happy as if all tho&s;e rights that were brought about by King William had been brought about by demons. Do <HI>you</HI> any of
<PB N="92" REF="98">you love the reformation the le&s;s becau&s;e it was brought about by Henry the Eighth? becau&s;e his motives were bad, and he had &s;quandered the trea|&s;ures of his father, and had put to death one woman to marry another his affections had been fixed upon, and though he did it from the mo&s;t degenerate mo|tive, does it alter the reformation or affect its priority, or in the &s;malle&s;t degree affect the Prince or hurt the title of the King who &s;its upon the throne of this country? Will my learned friend &s;ay, if I were to write a whole volume again&s;t Harry the Eighth with the mo&s;t pointed a&s;perity, that I &s;hould be convicted of a libel? where is the difference, whether it be one or two centuries ago it happened? it was not in the &s;mallest degree libellous; if it were, you will find that one of our mo&s;t valuable hi&s;torians had been guilty of it; he gives it us from the records of the country, the manner in which King William and his creatures brought this about; he would be an&s;werable for a libel if Mr. Paine is for writing this; and it is im|po&s;&s;ible any man write a page of hi&s;tory, if that is the ca&s;e. Mr. Hume &s;tates the intrigues which paved the way for King William's coming to the throne: he &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the former articles of the Great Charter contain &s;uch mitigations and explanations of the Feudal Law as are rea&s;onable and equitable; and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a loyal Government, and provide for the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, and free en|joyment
<PB N="93" REF="99">of property; the great object for which political &s;ociety was at fir&s;t founded by men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor &s;tatute, nor po&s;itive in&s;titution, ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts and attention.</Q></P>
<P>And thus the revolution was brought about by a coalition of the parties of the court: what matters it by what means it was brought about&mdash;the que&s;tion is, what is the thing brought about? and whether it &s;tands upon the con&s;ent of our ance&s;tors, followed up and kept in exi&s;tence by our own? if it is, no man can rebel again&s;t it without being a victim to the laws. All I am arguing for is the freedom of opinion, not the freedom of conduct which is bound, as Mr. Paine &s;ays, in every part of this work, by the in&s;titu|tion by which a man is called upon to live.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to what has been &s;aid of the Edwards and Henries, &s;urely my learned friend will not arraign this becau&s;e the author is not well enough read to know Edward the Third was a great Prince and King, and becau&s;e he names him with the Henries it is a lebel; but, &s;ays he, he tells you there was no Con&s;titution up to the Revolution, but that all the con&s;titution was got piece-meal, by the people &s;trug|gling with tho&s;e tyrants. I &s;ay &s;o; and I think it for the honour and advantage of the country, that it &s;hould be known. How is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay Magna Charta was not to take from King John that
<PB N="94" REF="100">a&s;&s;umed power which he over and over again a&s;&s;erted? Two-and-forty times the &s;tatute of Magna Charta has been re-enacted; &s;ometimes with arms in tho hands of the people; and King John was forced to &s;ign it at Runnemede. The people took it as their inheritance; they had a right to it. How is it with re&s;pect to the other parts? how did they e&s;tabli&s;h it at the Revolution, and in every other part of our hi&s;tory? Gentlemen, I was ob&s;erving they were taken by the people with arms in their hands; and it was given even as a the&s;is in the different univer|&s;ities, and it happened to be allotted to me, while I was under the di&s;cipline of a college of England, to maintain, and a reward for maintaining &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the liberty of the people of England at the Re|volution, did not ari&s;e from any remains of the Saxon liberty, but it aro&s;e from the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of the Normans; it carried the &s;pirit of freedom from man to man, from one end of the kingdom to the other; and by &s;low degrees, by imperceptible and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles that was obtained from tho&s;e princes who&s;e power was a&s;&s;umed, in violation of tho&s;e rights which are unalienable, and belong to all mankind. Mr. Hume him&s;elf &s;tates expre&s;&s;ly, that the Con&s;titution of this country was nearly an ab&s;olute monarchy, notwith&s;tanding the numerous panegyrics upon it. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay one man is to be puni&s;hed for what another man has written who has become a cla&s;&s;ic in the language. All the world will not make that intelligible. Notwith&s;tanding all the nu|merous
<PB N="95" REF="101">panegyrics upon Engli&s;h liberty, it may be &s;aid to be an ab&s;olute monarchy till the la&s;t century; it appears &s;o from all Mr. Hume has recorded. Shall it be &s;aid, if a grave hi&s;torian writes that, that ano|ther man &s;hall be made criminal for a&s;&s;erting the &s;ame principles?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the next pa&s;&s;age arraigned is this: <Q>The attention of the Government of England; for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name than the Engli&s;h Government</Q> (tho' if there is any dif|ference, I am &s;ure I don't comprehend it) <Q>ap|pears &s;ince its political connection with Germany to be &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed, and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es: do|me&s;tic concerns are neglected, and with re&s;pect to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>That the Government of this country in con&s;e|quence of that connection has certainly been loaded with a great number of taxes, I believe no man can doubt: when a man contemplates the va&s;t &s;y&s;tem of revenue, he may be led to a thought of that &s;ort; he does not arraign the admini&s;tration of law or ju&s;|tice; he does not &s;ay the law is admini&s;tered with|out regard to truth, or that the magi&s;trates are cor|rupt; if he had done &s;o, that I admit would be a li|bel. He &s;tates (which has been &s;tated over and over again from the pulpits of this country) that the law of this country is mainly defective; that it wants that which &s;hould belong to it, and is over|loaded with a variety of forms that tend, of many
<PB N="96" REF="102">&s;ubjects that are brought, to apply. Gentlemen, I am not arguing for the right of free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, let us &s;ee whether we cannot find authors that &s;peak their opinions from palaces (where certainly nothing &s;editious would be endured) and draw a compari|&s;on of the law of England and that country from whence Mr. Paine came, America. This is ob&s;erved by Mr. Newcombe de Cappe, and you will find others taking notice of our juri&s;prudence, by tho&s;e called upon to admini&s;ter the law from the bench; therefore, the Gentleman's ob&s;ervation as to the law, does not appear to be that &s;pecies of attack that falls within the de&s;cription of a libel, if you take it in the &s;en&s;e I am giving it, and in the &s;en&s;e I wi&s;h you to con&s;ider. Gentlemen, with re&s;pect to the Hou&s;e of Lords, I believe I &s;hall be able to &s;hew you the very per&s;on who introduced this con|trover&s;y, and who is con&s;idered by tho&s;e that are intere&s;ted in the government at pre&s;ent, as a man truly devoted to maintain the government of the country in the highe&s;t order and pre&s;ervation. He has made remarks not kinder, and you will think more &s;evere, than the Attorney General did to-day. He &s;ays that two Hou&s;es appear to be effectually in|fluenced into one, though not in their original con|&s;truction. Mr. Burke is plea&s;ed to &s;ay of the Hou&s;e of Lords in the&s;e words: <Q>It is &s;omething more than a century ago &s;ince we voted the Hou&s;e of Lords u&s;ele&s;s, and they have now voted them|&s;elves &s;o; and the whole heap of reformation</Q>
<PB N="97" REF="103">(&s;peaking of the Hou&s;e of Commons,) <Q>is ca&s;t upon us.</Q></P>
<P>He does not &s;peak of it in the Hou&s;e, or merely in his place in Parliament, but it is printed and re|printed; and a new edition was publi&s;hed not above three months ago, and circulated through the pub|lic. This pa&s;&s;age &s;till &s;tands its ground; he thought it applicable to remark upon the abu&s;es which pre|vail in Parliament, and which may lead to various &s;erious con&s;equences, if not con&s;idered by the people of this country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, this was held out upon a recent occa&s;ion by that per&s;on who is now in the highe&s;t &s;ituation in his Maje&s;ty's council, and who has the confidence of the nation, as I am given to under|&s;tand, and who has the order of the &s;tate put into his hands. I am not meaning to calumniate him; but in my opinion that was the brighte&s;t pa&s;&s;age of his life, and I &s;hould have thought him brighter, if he had continued in tho&s;e &s;entiments.&mdash;That Right Honourable Gentleman I have a right to &s;peak of, and make u&s;e of as an authority for his talents, rank in the country, and various circum|&s;tances that tend to adorn him; but I think, Gen|tlemen, it would be a hard thing not only upon the defendant, but a hard thing upon the country, if it is to be decided, That that which is to be done with impunity and with approbation, and &s;poken highly of by one man, &s;hould bring another man to a pil|lory or a pri&s;on. What is the a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. Paine?
<PB N="98" REF="104">That the Mini&s;ter touches the Hou&s;e of Lords, as with an opium wand, and that it &s;leeps obedience. Does he mean to &s;ay that is any part of the original misfoundation of it? Does he &s;ay it has de&s;cended from generation to generation? he does not, he gives it that root and foundation Sir George Saville, that illu&s;trious patriot, gives it; who tells you that the Hou&s;e of Commons was in his time what Mr. Paine repre&s;ents it; that the Hou&s;e of Lords was what Mr. Paine repre&s;ents it; and all attempts to reform it would be ridiculous, except tho&s;e, the foundation of what is written in this book.</P>
<P>I oberved my learned friend rai&s;e his voice, as if any thing concerning Mr. Horne Tooke was to be a rea&s;on why the de&s;endant was not to have the &s;ame judgment as if Horne Tooke's name had not been mentioned. Let us &s;ee what is decided by that Right Honourable Gentleman at the time I am con&s;ider|ing him that illu&s;trious patriot for the pre&s;ervation of that Con&s;titution we live under. I hope and tru&s;t, whatever may be the event of this day, you will not &s;urrender any part of the liberty of the pre&s;s, or any part of the genuine freedom or benefits ari&s;ing from it to this country; and though I have the un|plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of knowing I make no effect on your minds, yet I mu&s;t di&s;charge my duty in the minds of tho&s;e who hear me; I will maintain my own, here and everywhere; and with unabated patience and per&s;everence will I go through what I take to be my ta&s;k.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105">This was recorded, and &s;ent throughout the coun|try; it is in the&s;e words, &s;igned by that Right Ho|nourable Gentleman, by the Duke of Richmond, Lord Stanhope, and Mr. Wyndham, but particu|larly the name of the Duke of Richmond &s;tands at the head of it; when I &s;ay that Right Honour|able Gentleman, I mean the Right Honourable William Pitt. This declaration was publi&s;hed not as an ab&s;tract of &s;peculative writing, but as a writ|ing publi&s;hed within a week after the Hou&s;e of Com|mons decreed they would make no alteration in the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament: they met at the Thatched-hou&s;e (and they had a right to do it) and gave their opinion to the people of this country: Were they pro&s;ecuted for libels? I de&s;ire you as men of honour, and as men of truth, to judge of Mr. Paine's book, which talks of the Mini&s;ter with his opium wand. Mr. Burke, at that time of day &s;ays, <Q>In con&s;equence of this corrupt and venal Parlia|ment, in con&s;equence of the influence of the crown extending throughout the realm taken together&mdash;</Q> What is the cure Mr. Burke pre&s;cribes? he tells you the people without doors are to be excited to look to tho&s;e evils. I will read it in his own words: he &s;ays, <Q>Let equal ju&s;tice be done; don't let one man be burnt in effigy for affection to Government, while other men are enjoying all the &s;weets that belong to a &s;uppo&s;ed attachment to the Con&s;titu|tion.</Q> He &s;ays this, <Q>The di&s;tempers of mo|narchy would be a great &s;ubject of apprehen&s;ion;
<PB N="100" REF="106">it is not Parliament alone that can remedy it; and the people ought to be excited to a more &s;trict attention to the conduct of their repre&s;enta|tives.</Q> In God's name, Gentlemen, how are they to know it, if I cannot &s;ay it in general terms in the Hou&s;e of Parliament, without venturing to ad|vance a libel? how am I to come forward, as it is one of my privileges to come forward, and warn the people of England, of the conduct of this or that man; he &s;ays, <Q>he writes not to them only, but to the whole people of England, and it ought to be &s;ettled in the meetings.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, the Engli&s;h of it is this: The&s;e &s;editious publications which are &s;o loudly talked of, were in the market all that time, as my learned friend &s;tated; no man thought of it, no man talked of it at the time, when a certain number of per&s;ons pro|posed what I have read out of that green book; in another place no information was upon the file; but no &s;ooner this was publi&s;hed, than we hear the king|dom was to be overturned by per&s;ons pre&s;uming to publi&s;h &s;arca&s;ms and libels. My opinion is, the Government will never be affected by any libel; let it be corrected by its own purity; as Doctor John|&s;on &s;ays, <Q>If they examine their own conduct they will find the cau&s;e; let them correct it, and they will find the remedy.</Q>&mdash;I tru&s;t it is one of the deare&s;t privileges the people have, to examine and watch over every part of the Government of the
<PB N="101" REF="107">country; and the pre&s;s ought to be free for a man's con&s;ideration, to make what remarks he plea&s;es, touching the frailty of the &s;tructure, or any part of the Government, whether it be frail in it&s;elf, or rendered frail by tho&s;e acts ari&s;ing from its being con&s;tituted &s;uch a number of years&mdash;provided you think the man who wrote it believed in tho&s;e im|per&s;ections, and the advantage or di&s;advantages. I think that any per&s;on &s;tanding here upon his trial for giving that little account I have been reading, cannot be guilty of a libel. Let us remember what it is this celebrated per&s;on &s;ays, when he is &s;peaking of Lords and Commons, and why he would have aboli&s;hed &s;ome of tho&s;e high offices about the King's per&s;on. You all know I &s;peak of Mr. Burke; he &s;ays, among other things, "If tho&s;e &s;alaries are taken away, the nobles would de&s;ert the court."</P>
<P>I do not agree with Mr. Burke in his po&s;ition; I di&s;mi&s;s the po&s;ition, as I think it is a &s;currilous &s;habby attack upon the nobles of the land, and upon his Maje&s;ty; and though Mr. Burke has a right to write &s;o, I &s;ay it is an infinitely more &s;habby and fouler attack than the pre&s;ent, &mdash; I hope your Lord&s;hip under&s;tands me, I am &s;peaking of it with di&s;approbation. What does he &s;ay? he &s;ays, <Q>a King is naturally a man who is fond of low company, is fond of the lowe&s;t and wor&s;t mi&s;creants; there|fore we mu&s;t fir&s;t get this nece&s;&s;ary thing and then we mu&s;t take care to bribe that part of it;
<PB N="102" REF="108">a parcel of fellows, not fit for any thing; and take care of another part that is equally as bad, though not quite &s;o bad as fidlers and buffoons.</Q> Gentlmen, that is a &s;arca&s;m upon the Briti&s;h Con&s;ti|tution; but mix it with the whole of the mat|ter contained in the man's book. If he writes any thing about the King, he mu&s;t be convicted, and I could not defend him; I mu&s;t &s;tand in my place to do my duty, which would be over in an in&s;tant, though it is not charged even on record to be a libel upon the king's Maje&s;ty. I &s;ay it does not include the King. Does the Attorney General &s;ay it does? if he does, I can call for a verdict; but if my learned friend chu&s;es to change his innuendo, he &s;hall do it now; but no jury could find an innuendo which there is no evidence to &s;upport. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e publications that &s;peak about monarchy, what a wonderful in&s;tance have you in Harrington: I don't know whether it did not come from &s;ome publi&s;hing &s;ocieties. He was repre&s;ented as a republican wri|ter, that had been promoting the murder of King Charles I.: a low ob&s;cure man, who ha no wi&s;h but that which every de&s;perate man has, of pulling down what was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It does divert one to &s;ee tho&s;e per&s;ons write thus, though I dare not be angry with any body that writes; but the&s;e are a &s;et of fellows, who will let nobody write but them&s;elves; they publi&s;h books, and you have them thrown into your chai&s;e in an|&s;wer to this book; but if any man would give notice
<PB N="103" REF="109">of it, and undertake to pro&s;ecute and aid the civil magi&s;trate, not tho&s;e that the Attorney General thinks objects of pro&s;ecution, but a &s;et of Gentle|men who chu&s;e to call them&s;elves lawyers into the bargain, this con&s;piracy, as they call it, and I call upon my Lord to &s;upport me, that when a man is &s;tanding upon his trial for publi&s;hing what he has written upon the con&s;titution; are the&s;e the means by which Engli&s;hmen are taught to love it? I &s;ay, if this man was &s;tained with blood, in&s;tead of ink, if he was covered over with crimes at which human nature would &s;hudder, &s;till he is equally intitled to that hearing allowed him, and which he has a right to as a member of the con&s;titution. gentlemen, I &s;tand here as an advocate for this man; an perhaps if I had not a con&s;iderable degree of pre&s;ence of mind, ari&s;ing from con&s;iderable experience, I &s;hould have been beat down long ago, not but that you have given me a mo&s;t painful and obliging attention, but becau&s;e I know every avenue is choaked up again&s;t me; I know the whole pre&s;s is pointed again&s;t me, and this man by name; all the engines of govern|ment have been employed again&s;t him; and in the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament they have named him, and prejudged his work.</P>
<P>I gave my &s;entiments as an Engli&s;h Lawyer; which was con&s;i&s;tent with that dignity of character which I hold in that a&s;&s;embly. I have nothing to hope or fear from doing my duty, which I
<PB N="104" REF="110">will not &s;hrink from, but will per&s;evere in it t the la&s;t. Gentlemen, it is &s;aid, that the man I alluded to, who has written any thing like it, is as great a thief, and as ob&s;cure a ruffian, as this man. Gentlemen, this Mr. Harrington, this low black|guard, this murderer of Princes, this blood-&s;tained ruffian, is de&s;cended (you will &s;ee it for Six-Pence at the Herald's office) from Eight Dukes, Three Marqui&s;&s;es, Seventy Earls, Twenty-&s;even Baronets, Thirty-&s;ix Barons, of which number Sixteen were Knights of the Garter. If this cau&s;e was tried in Germany in&s;|tead of England (I have a right to be heard) what was he? Be&s;ides he lived in the reign of Charles I. Oh brutal ignorance of he history of this country, and this is his mo&s;t affectionate &s;ervant; and it is ob&s;erved he was a republican, by what the hi&s;torian &s;ays. Toland &s;ays, I cannot too much boa&s;t of the man the king's favourite: I know not which mo&s;t to commend, the king for tru&s;ting an hone&s;t man, though of republican principles, or Harrington for owning his principles while he &s;erved the king. How did he &s;erve him? May all men who profe&s;s mo|narchy &s;o &s;erve their monarchs! He &s;taid with him in the I&s;le of Wight, to watch the fortune of his royal ma&s;ter; he came up by &s;tealth; he hid him&s;elf in the boot of the coach, to take a la&s;t farewell of him, and fell into his arms; and afterwards fainted on the &s;caffold, at the feet of his expiring ma&s;ter, After the death of Charles he wrote his famous Oceana; and after paying tribute to a virtuous and
<PB N="105" REF="111">unfortunate ma&s;ter, he contended it was not Charles I. that brought on his own death, but the evil nature of monarchies. Gentlemen, then it was the &s;eizure of books began, by that tyrant Cromwell; and you fir&s;t begin to learn what a wi&s;e man Cromwell was. Harrington begged his book from Cromwell's favorite daughter; and &s;eeing her infant at her &s;ide, he &s;natched it up in his arms, and ran away. Alarmed for its fate, the mother followed him. Says he, <Q>I have taken your child, and I know what you feel for its lo&s;s; your father has got my child,</Q> meaning his publication, <Q>I re&s;tore to you your child &mdash; &s;upplicate your father to re&s;tore mine.</Q> The daughter petitioned her father, and Cromwell yielded. Says he, <Q>I will give it you; for, if my government is made to &s;tand, it will never be hurt by this paper-&s;hot.</Q> Nor will any government, as Milton &s;ays. Let another man read it; let him an&s;wer it&mdash;that is another way; let him do as Mr. Adams did. I contend, that out of a coalition of writers truth is to come. I do not quarrel with Mr. Adams for writing his opinions; &s;o &s;aid a celebrated per&s;on, who was an ornament to his country, the Pre&s;ident Monte&s;quieu. Says he, <Q>It is not ma|terial, in a free country, how men rea&s;on; it is enough that they do rea&s;on: the coalition of rea|&s;oning brings forth the truth, and that truth is the ba&s;is of the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t government, as long as people are capable of knowing its value.</Q> Gen|tlemen, let me then addre&s;s you in, I think, language
<PB N="106" REF="112">the mo&s;t affectionate it is po&s;&s;ible to hear, here or any where; an extract from the &s;ame author I men|tioned before, where he rai&s;es at once, in that &s;ublime and glorious manner of writing and thinking, &s;o pecu|liar to that mighty poet Milton; a man&mdash;how &s;hall I de&s;cribe him?&mdash;no copier of any thing that is human; he looked up to that &s;ublime Source, as he de&s;cribes it, the univer&s;al God and Father of the world, who, as he expre&s;&s;es it, is the &s;ource of all wi&s;dom, and who &s;endeth out his &s;un, and touches with the hal|lowed fire of his altar tho&s;e lips which he plea&s;es to in&s;pire. Methinks I &s;ee it &s;o;&mdash;I think I &s;ee not the di&s;tinction of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution;&mdash;but I think I &s;ee what Milton thought at tho&s;e times he &s;aw; but which unfortunately never came to pa&s;s. The country is for&s;ooth in danger by the publication of a &s;ix-penny pamphlet, but the au&s;pices of the greate&s;t &s;tate&s;man are eminently &s;o. A man whom to name is to honor and to admire; a man whom to hi&s;tory can &s;hew a greater, nor any private acquaintance more dear; a man who is loved with the affection of a friend; a man who put to its hazard his ea&s;e and darling popularity, for the benefit of the people of the land, that he was born by his mighty talents to cultivate and reduce to order. This is the character given to Mr. Fox by Mr. Burke; and this is the man with whom, &s;ays he, I have lived in the greate&s;t friend&s;hip, and whom I may &s;ay I have lived to &s;ee treated in the manner I have unfortunately witne&s;&s;ed. Gentlemen, I have but a few words more to trouble
<PB N="107" REF="113">you with, if you will have the goodne&s;s to hear me; and that is this: I wi&s;h that this man may be judged of by you in the manner I have been propo&s;ing; that all this freedom, though it is not any other freedom than belongs to the con&s;titution of the country. Re|member, I am not a&s;king the verdict for him, on any other in&s;titution than the law of England. I am not de&s;iring your deci&s;ion on any other con&s;titution. The policy of Great Britain is not to have a jealou&s;y over her &s;ubjects, to know what is for the benefit of the whole community. The &s;ubjects of England are affected to whatever is right and hone&s;t; and let rea&s;on be rea&s;on, let truth and fal&s;ehood oppo&s;e and fight one another, but it is better to pur&s;ue this cour&s;e with re&s;pect to Engli&s;hmen, which was pro|po&s;ed by Lord Chatham. Do not think they are to be bent to your purpo&s;e by a froward conduct.</P>
<Q><L>Be to their faults a little blind;</L>
<L>Be to their virtues very kind:</L>
<L>Let all their thoughts be unconfined,</L>
<L>And clap your padlock on their mind.</L></Q>
<P>Do not limit their conception; and do not imagine with the Attorney General, that they are to be led away either by argument, or by &s;arca&s;m: but it is to operate by degrees, it is to engage their affections, convince their rea&s;on, and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty &s;incere, vi|gorous or rational; a conviction which will operate by degrees, that it is their true&s;t intere&s;t, and that their
<PB N="108" REF="114">form of government is for their common good: con&s;traint is the natural parent of re&s;i&s;tance, and this doctrine is by no means novel. In all hi&s;tories of former times, it has always been expre&s;s and con|vincing, that where one &s;ide has been tyrannical, the other &s;ide, that was in oppo&s;ition to it, has been refractory: on the other hand, all nations have con&s;i|dered the contrary even as long ago as Lucian. You all remember, Gentlemen, the plea&s;ant &s;tory in that fable of his re&s;pecting the Countryman and Jupiter; they were conver&s;ing with great freedom and fami|liary on the &s;ubjects of heaven and earth; and coun|tryman li&s;tened with great attention, and acquie&s;ced in the conver&s;ation &s;o long as Jupiter tried only to convince him by rea&s;on and argument; but the Countryman happening to hint a doubt as to the truth and propriety of &s;omething which Jupiter had advanced, he in&s;tantly turned round and threatened him with his thunder: No, &s;ays the Countryman, if you up with your thunder, I believe you are in the wrong; you are always wrong when you appeal to your thunder; as long as you have rea&s;on on your &s;ide, I believe you may be right, but I cannot fight again&s;t thunder. So, Gentlemen, I cannot fight again&s;t the united voice of the people of England, and God forbid I &s;hould; I am an obedient &s;ubject and &s;ervant of the law&mdash;to that rule of action I &s;hall ever give my voice, opinion, and conduct. You may condemn my con|duct, but I &s;hall ever do as I have been doing to|day;
<PB N="109" REF="115">I hope, with confidence, that I am not tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e rules in doing the duties of my &s;itua|tion which are accidentally ca&s;t upon me.</P>
<P>The Attorney General ro&s;e to reply, but Mr. Campbell, the foreman of the Jury, &s;aid he was in&s;ctructed by his brother jurors to &s;ay that he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of any ob&s;ervations, unle&s;s he thought otherwi&s;e him&s;elf, for that they were &s;atisfied.&mdash;The Jury immediately gave their verdict <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;udden and extraordinary manner of calling Parlia|ment, the critical &s;ituation of the&s;e kingdoms and of all Europe, the rapid and unexampled progre&s;s of the French armies, the general agitation that &s;eems to pervades the human mind among&s;t all ranks of people, form a cri&s;is that
<PB N="2" REF="118">is intere&s;ting and alarming, and promi&s;es a continuation of the mo&s;t important events.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a moment the attention of all mankind will be directed to the <HI>Debates</HI> and <HI>Proceedings</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h Parlia|ment.</HI> The judgment not only of this country, but the &s;en|timents and mea&s;ures of other countries, will be formed and regulated by the conduct of the Briti&s;h Senate. A correct and an early knowledge of the&s;e Proceedings is, therefore, at this moment, more peculiarly important than at any for|mer period whatever. To furni&s;h this information from the be&s;t &s;ources and authorities is the de&s;ign of this publication. And in order that it may be communicated in as quick a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as the regard to accuracy will permit, we propo&s;e to publi&s;h our <HI>Parliamentary Journal</HI> Weekly; and at the ea&s;y price of Six-pence each Number, that the purcha&s;e may be within the ability of almo&s;t every man.</P>
<P>An impartial narrative of the <HI>Debates</HI> and <HI>Proceedings</HI> of <HI>both Hou&s;es of Parliament</HI> is at all times u&s;eful and proper. It is full of information on every &s;ubject. To our youth it is the be&s;t and noble&s;t in&s;tructor. The lawyer, the merchant, the manufacturer, the trader, will there &s;ee the con&s;titution, the intere&s;ts, the policy of our country, de&s;cribed by men of the fir&s;t talents, erudition, and character. In the peru&s;al of &s;uch a work we obtain, in a &s;hort time, and at an ea&s;y expence, the re&s;ult of the profounde&s;t labours, rea&s;oning, and reflection; we di&s;cover the de&s;igns of men, and the views of parties; we become habituated to a correct phra&s;e|ology, and to a general knowledge of the various principles and abu&s;es of government. If the&s;e advantages occur at all times from &s;uch a Work, how much more nece&s;&s;ary are &s;uch advantages at this time! when every per&s;on in the&s;e kingdoms (be his &s;ituation in life high or low) is become deeply intere&s;ted in tho&s;e deliberations and mea&s;ures which are to decide upon his fate, upon his intere&s;ts, and perhaps upon his per&s;onal fecurity.</P>
<P>We beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the public, that our Work &s;hall be conducted with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality, diligence, and fidelity.</P>
