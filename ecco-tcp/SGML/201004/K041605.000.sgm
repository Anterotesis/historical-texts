<P>OUR Defects and Follies are too often un|known to us; nay, they are &s;o far from being known to us, that they pa&s;s for Demon&s;tra|tions of our Worth. This makes us ea&s;ie in the mid&s;t of them, fond to &s;hew them, fond to im|prove in them, and to be e&s;teemed for them. Then it is that a thou&s;and unaccountable Conceits, gay Inventions, and extravagant Actions mu&s;t af|ford us Plea&s;ures, and di&s;play us to others in the Colours which we our &s;elves take a Fancy to glo|ry in: And indeed there is &s;omething &s;o amu&s;ing for the Time in this State of Vanity and ill-ground|ed
<PB N="184" REF="188">Satisfaction, that even the wi&s;er World has cho&s;en an exalted Word to de&s;cribe its Enchant|ments, and called it <HI>the Paradi&s;e of Fools.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the latter Part of this Reflection may &s;eem a fal&s;e Thought to &s;ome, and bear another Turn than what I have given; but it is at pre&s;ent none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s to look after it, who am go|ing to confe&s;s that I have been lately among&s;t them in a Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Methought I was tran&s;ported to a Hill, green, flowery, and of an ea&s;y A&s;cent. Upon the broad Top of it re&s;ided &s;quint-eyed <HI>Errour,</HI> and popu|lar <HI>Opinion</HI> with many Heads; two that dealt in Sorcery, and were famous for bewitching People with the Love of them&s;elves. To the&s;e repaired a Multitude from every Side, by two different Paths which lead towards each of them. Some who had the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming Air went directly of them&s;elves to <HI>Errour,</HI> without expecting a Con|ductor; others of a &s;ofter Nature went fir&s;t to popular <HI>Opinion,</HI> from whence as &s;he influenced and engaged them with their own Prai&s;es, &s;he de|livered them over to his Government.</P>
<P>When we had a&s;cended to an open Part of the Summit where <HI>Opinion</HI> abode, we found her en|tertaining &s;everal who had arrived before us. Her Voice was plea&s;ing; &s;he breathed Odours as &s;he &s;poke: She &s;eemed to have a Tongue for every one;
<PB N="185" REF="189">every one thought he heard of &s;omething that was valuable in him&s;elf, and expected a Paradi&s;e which &s;he promi&s;ed as the Reward of his Merit. Thus were we drawn to follow her, till &s;he &s;hould bring us where it was to be be&s;towed: And it was ob&s;ervable, that all the Way we went, the Com|pany was either prai&s;ing them&s;elves in their Quali|fications, or one another for tho&s;e Qualifications which they took to be con&s;picuous in their own Characters, or di&s;prai&s;ing others for wanting theirs, or vying in the Degrees of them.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we approached a Bower, at the Entrance of which <HI>Errour</HI> was &s;eated. The Trees were thick-woven, and the Place where he &s;at artfully contrived to darken him a little. He was di&s;gui|&s;ed in a whiti&s;h Robe, which he had put on, that he might appear to us with a nearer Re&s;em|blance to <HI>Truth:</HI> And as &s;he has a Light whereby &s;he manife&s;ts the Beauties of Nature to the Eyes of her Adorers, &s;o he had provided him&s;elf with a magical Wand, that he might do &s;omething in Imitation of it, and plea&s;e with Delu&s;ions. This he lifted &s;olemnly, and muttering to him&s;elf, bid the Glories which he kept under Enchantment to appear before us. Immediately we ca&s;t our Eyes on that part of the Sky to which he pointed, and ob&s;erved a thin blue Pro&s;pect, which cleared as Mountains in a Summer Morning when the Mi&s;ts go off, and the Palace of <HI>Vanity</HI> appeared to Sight.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="190">The Foundation hardly &s;eemed a Foundation, but a Set of curling Clouds, which it &s;tood upon by magical Contrivance. The Way by which we a&s;cended was painted like a Rainbow; and as we went the Breeze that played about us bewitch|ed the Sen&s;es. The Walls were gilded all for Show; the lowe&s;t Set of Pillars were of the &s;light Fine <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, and the Top of the Building being rounded, bore &s;o far the Re&s;em|blance of a Bubble.</P>
<P>At the Gate the Travellers neither met with a Porter, nor waited till one &s;hould appear; every one thought his Merits a &s;ufficient Pa&s;sport, and pre&s;&s;ed forward. In the Hall we met with &s;everal Phantoms, that rov'd among&s;t us, and rang'd the Company according to their Sentiments. There was decrea&s;ing <HI>Honour,</HI> that had nothing to &s;hew in but an old Coat of his Ance&s;tors Atchievements: There was <HI>O&s;tentation,</HI> that made him&s;elf his own con&s;tant Subject, and <HI>Gallantry</HI> &s;trutting up|on his Tip-toes. At the upper end of the Hall &s;tood a Throne, who&s;e Canopy glitter'd with all the Riches that Gayety could contrive to lavi&s;h on it; and between the gilded Arms &s;at <HI>Vanity</HI> deck'd in the Peacock's Feathers, and acknowledged for another <HI>Venus</HI> by her Votaries. The Boy who &s;tood be&s;ide her for a <HI>Cupid,</HI> and who made the World to bow before her, was called <HI>Self-Conceit.</HI> His Eyes had every now and then a Ca&s;t in wards,
<PB N="187" REF="191">to the Neglect of all Objects about him; and the Arms which he made u&s;e of for Conque&s;t, were borrowed from tho&s;e again&s;t whom he had a De|&s;ign. The Arrow which he &s;hot at the Soldier, was fledg'd from his own Plume of Feathers; the Dart he directed again&s;t the Man of Wit, was winged from the Quills he writ with; and that which he &s;ent again&s;t tho&s;e who pre&s;umed upon their Riches, was headed with Gold out of their Trea&s;uries: He made Nets for State&s;men from their own Contrivances; he took Fire from the Eyes of Ladies, with which he melted their Hearts; and Lightning from the Tongues of the Eloquent, to enflame them with their own Glories. At the Foot of the Throne &s;at three fal&s;e Graces. <HI>Flattery</HI> with a Shell of Paint, <HI>Affectation</HI> with a Mirrour to practi&s;e at, and <HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> ever chang|ing the Po&s;ture of her Cloaths. The&s;e applied them&s;elves to &s;ecure the Conque&s;ts which <HI>Self-Conceit</HI> had gotten, and had each of them their particular Polities. <HI>Flattery</HI> gave new Colours and Complexions to all Things, <HI>Affectation</HI> new Airs and Appearances, which, as &s;he &s;aid, were not vulgar, and <HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> both concealed &s;ome home Defects, and added &s;ome foreign external Beauties.</P>
<P>As I was reflecting upon what I &s;aw, I heard a Voice in the Crowd, bemoaning the Condition of Mankind, which is thus managed by the Breath of <HI>Opinion,</HI> deluded by <HI>Errour,</HI> fir'd by <HI>Self-Con|ceit,</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="192">and given up to be trained in all the Cour&s;es of <HI>Vanity,</HI> till <HI>Scorn</HI> or <HI>Poverty</HI> come upon us. The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions were no &s;ooner handed about, but I immediately &s;aw a general Di&s;order, till at la&s;t there was a Parting in one Place, and a grave old Man decent and re&s;olute, was led forward to be puni&s;hed for the Words he had uttered. He appeared inclined to have &s;poken in his own De|fence, but I could not ob&s;erve that any one was willing to hear him. <HI>Vanity</HI> ca&s;t a &s;cornful Smile at him; <HI>Self Conceit</HI> was angry; <HI>Flattery,</HI> who knew him for <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> put on a <HI>Vizard,</HI> and turned away; <HI>Affectation</HI> to&s;&s;ed her Fan, made Mouths, and called him <HI>Envy</HI> or <HI>Slander;</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> would have it, that at lea&s;t he mu&s;t be <HI>Ill-Manners.</HI> Thus &s;lighted and de&s;pi&s;ed by all, he was driven out for abu&s;ing People of Me|rit and Figure; and I heard it firmly re&s;olved, that he &s;hould be u&s;ed no better where-ever they met with him hereafter.</P>
<P>I had already &s;een the meaning of mo&s;t part of that Warning which he had given, and was con|&s;idering how the latter Words &s;hould be fulfilled, when a mighty Noi&s;e was heard without, and the Door was blackned by a numerous Train of Har|pies crowding in upon us. <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Broken Cre|dit</HI> were &s;een in the Hou&s;e before they entered. <HI>Trouble, Shame, Infamy, Scorn</HI> and <HI>Poverty</HI> brought up the Rear. <HI>Vanity,</HI> with her <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> di&s;appeared; her Subjects ran into
<PB N="189" REF="193">Holes and Corners; but many of them were found and carried off (as I was told by one who &s;tood near me) either to Pri&s;ons or Cellars, Soli|tude, or little Company, the mean Arts or the viler Crafts, of Life. But the&s;e, added he with a di&s;dainful Air, are &s;uch who would fond|ly live here, when their Merits neither matched the Lu&s;tre of the Place, nor their Riches its Expences. We have &s;een &s;uch Scenes as the&s;e before now; the Glory you &s;aw will all return when the Hurry is over. I thank'd him for his Information, and believing him &s;o incorrigible as that he would &s;tay till it was his Turn to be taken, I made off to the Door, and overtook &s;ome few, who, though they would not heark|en to <HI>Plain-dealing,</HI> were now terrified to good purpo&s;e by the Example of others: But when they had touched the Thre&s;hold, it was a &s;trange &s;hock to them to find that the Delu&s;ion of <HI>Er|rour</HI> was gone, and they plainly di&s;cerned the Building to hang a little up in the Air without any real Foundation. At fir&s;t we &s;aw nothing but a de&s;perate Leap remained for us, and I a thou&s;and times blamed my unmeaning Curio&s;i|ty that had brought me into &s;o much Danger. But as they began to &s;ink lower in their own Minds, methought the Palace &s;unk along with us, till they were arrived at the due Point of <HI>E&s;teem</HI> which they ought to have for them|&s;elves; then the Part of the Building in which they &s;tood touched the Earth, and we depart|ing
<PB N="190" REF="194">out, it retired from our Eyes. Now, whether they who &s;tayed in the Palace were &s;en&s;ible of this De&s;cent, I cannot tell; it was then my Opinion that they were not. How|ever it be, my Dream broke up at it, and has given me Occa&s;ion all my Life to reflect upon the fatal Con&s;equences of following the Sug|ge&s;tions of <HI>Vanity.</HI></P>

<P>HOW are we tortured with the Ab&s;ence of what we covet to po&s;&s;e&s;s, when it ap|pears to be lo&s;t to us! What Excur&s;ions does the Soul make in Imagination after it! and how does it turn into it &s;elf again, more fooli&s;hly fond and dejected, at the Di&s;appointment! Our Grief, in|&s;tead of having Recour&s;e to Rea&s;on, which might re&s;train it, &s;earches to find a further Nou|ri&s;hment. It calls upon Memory to relate the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages and Circum&s;tances of Satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed; the Plea&s;ures we
<PB N="192" REF="196">purcha&s;ed by tho&s;e Riches that are taken from us; or the Power and Splendour of our departed Ho|nours; or the Voice, the Words, the Looks, the Temper, and Affections of our Friends that are decea&s;ed. It needs mu&s;t happen from hence, that the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould often &s;well to &s;uch a Size as to bur&s;t the Heart which contains it, if Time did not make the&s;e Circum&s;tances le&s;s &s;trong and lively, &s;o that Rea&s;on &s;hould become a more e|qual Match for the Pa&s;&s;ion, or if another De&s;ire which becomes more pre&s;ent did not overpower them with a livelier Repre&s;entation. The&s;e are Thoughts which I had, when I fell into a kind of Vi&s;ion upon this Subject, and may therefore &s;tand for a proper Introduction to a Relation of it.</P>
<P>I found my &s;elf upon a naked Shore, with Company who&s;e afflicted Countenances witne&s;&s;ed their Conditions. Before us flowed a Water deep, &s;ilent, and called the River of <HI>Tears,</HI> which i&s;&s;uing from two Fountains on an upper Ground, encompa&s;&s;ed an I&s;land that lay before us. The Boat which plied in it was old and &s;hattered, having been &s;ometimes over&s;et by the Impatience and Ha&s;te of &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;engers to ar|rive at the other &s;ide. This immediately was brought to us by <HI>Misfortune</HI> who &s;teers it, and we were all preparing to take our Places, when there appeared a Woman of a mild and compo&s;ed Behaviour, who began to deter us from it, by repre&s;enting the Dangers which would attend our
<PB N="193" REF="197">Voyage. Hereupon &s;ome who knew her for <HI>Patience,</HI> and &s;ome of tho&s;e too who till then cry'd the loude&s;t, were per&s;uaded by her, and re|turn'd back. The re&s;t of us went in, and &s;he (who&s;e Good-nature would not &s;uffer her to for|&s;ake Per&s;ons in Trouble) de&s;ired Leave to accom|pany us, that &s;he might at lea&s;t admini&s;ter &s;ome &s;mall Comfort or Advice while we &s;ailed. We were no &s;ooner embarked but the Boat, was pu&s;h|ed off, the Sheet was &s;pread; and being filled with <HI>Sighs,</HI> which are the Winds of that Coun|try, we made a Pa&s;&s;age to the farther Bank thro' &s;everal Difficulties of which the mo&s;t of us &s;eem'd utterly regardle&s;s.</P>
<P>When we landed, we perceived the I&s;land to be &s;trangely over-ca&s;t with Fogs, which no Bright|ne&s;s could pierce, &s;o that a kind of gloomy Hor|ror &s;at always brooding over it. This had &s;ome|thing in it very &s;hocking to ea&s;y Tempers, in&s;o|much that &s;ome others, whom <HI>Patience</HI> had by this time gain'd over, left us here, and privily convey'd them&s;elves round the Verge of the I&s;land to find a Ford by which &s;he told them they might e&s;cape.</P>
<P>For my part, I &s;till went along with tho&s;e who were for piercing into the Centre of the Place; and joining our &s;elves to others whom we found upon the &s;ame Journey, we marched &s;o|lemnly as at a Funeral, thro' bordering Hedges
<PB N="194" REF="198">of Ro&s;emary, and thro' a Grove of Yew-Trees, which love to over-&s;hadow Tombs and flouri&s;h in Church-Yards. Here we heard on every &s;ide the Wailings and Complaints of &s;everal of the Inhabitants, who had ca&s;t them&s;elves di&s;con&s;o|lately at the Feet of Trees; and as we chanc'd to approach any of the&s;e, we might perceive them wringing their Hands, beating their Brea&s;ts, tear|ing their Hair, or after &s;ome other manner vi&s;ibly agitated with Vexation. Our Sorrows were heightned by the Influence of what we heard and &s;aw, and one of our Number was wrought up to &s;uch a Pitch of Wildne&s;s, as to talk of hanging him&s;elf upon a Bough which &s;hot temptingly a|cro&s;s the Path we travelled in; but he was re|&s;train'd from it by the kind Endeavours of our abovementioned Companion.</P>
<P>We had now gotten into the mo&s;t dusky &s;ilent Part of the I&s;land, and by the redoubled Sounds of Sighs, which made a doleful whi&s;tling in the Branches, the Thickne&s;s of Air which occa&s;ioned fainti&s;h Re&s;piration, and the violent Throbbings of Heart which more and more affected us, we found that we approach'd the <HI>Grotto of Grief.</HI> It was a wide, hollow, and melancholy Cave, &s;unk deep in a Dale, and watered by Rivulets that had a Colour between Red and Black. The&s;e crept &s;low, and half congealed among&s;t its Wind|ings, and mixed their heavy Murmur with the E|cho of Groans that rolled thro' all the Pa&s;&s;ages.
<PB N="195" REF="199">In the mo&s;t retired part of it &s;at the <HI>doleful Be|ing</HI> her &s;elf; the Path to her was &s;trewed with Goads, Stings, and Thorns; and the Throne on which &s;he &s;at was broken into a Rock with ragged Pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon. A heavy Mi&s;t hung above her, her Head oppre&s;&s;ed with it reclined upon her Arm: Thus did &s;he reign over her di&s;con&s;olate Subjects, full of her &s;elf to Stupidity, in eternal Pen&s;ivene&s;s, and the profounde&s;t Silence. On one &s;ide of her &s;tood <HI>Dejection</HI> ju&s;t dropping into a Swoon, and <HI>Pale|ne&s;s</HI> wa&s;ting to a Skeleton; on the other &s;ide were <HI>Care</HI> inwardly tormented with Imaginations, and <HI>Angui&s;h</HI> &s;uffering outward <HI>Troubles</HI> to &s;uck the Blood from her Heart in the Shape of <HI>Vultures.</HI> The whole Vault had a genuine Di&s;malne&s;s in it, which a few &s;cattered Lamps, who&s;e bluei&s;h Flames aro&s;e and &s;unk in their Urns, di&s;covered to our Eyes with Encrea&s;e. Some of us fell down, overcome and &s;pent with what they &s;uffer|ed in the way, and were given over to tho&s;e Tor|mentors that &s;tood on either Hand of the Pre|&s;ence; others, galled and mortified with Pain, recover'd the Entrance, where <HI>Patience,</HI> whom we had left behind, was &s;till waiting to receive us.</P>
<P>With her (who&s;e Company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her) we winded round the Grotto, and a&s;cended at the Back of it, out of the mournful Dale in
<PB N="196" REF="200">who&s;e Bottom it lay. On this Eminence we halted, by her Advice, to pant for Breath; and lifting our Eyes, which till then were fixed down|wards, felt a &s;ullen &s;ort of Satisfaction, in ob&s;er|ving thro' the Shades what Numbers had entred the I&s;land. This Satisfaction, which appears to have Ill-nature in it, was excu&s;able, becau&s;e it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own Concern, to have Re&s;pect to that of others; and therefore we did not con&s;ider them as &s;uffering, but our &s;elves as not &s;uffering in the mo&s;t forlorn E&s;tate. It had al&s;o the Ground|work of Humanity and Compa&s;&s;ion in it, though the Mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it; but as we proceeded onwards it began to di&s;cover it &s;elf, and from ob&s;erving that others were unhap|py, we came to que&s;tion one another, when it was that we met, and what were the &s;ad Occa&s;i|ons that brought us together. Then we heard our Stories, we compared them, we mutually gave and received Pity, and &s;o by degrees became to|lerable Company.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable Part of the trouble&s;ome Road was thus deceived; at length the Openings among the Trees grew larger, the Air &s;eemed thinner, it lay with le&s;s Oppre&s;&s;ion upon us, and we could now and then di&s;cern Tracts in it of a lighter Greyne&s;s, like the Breakings of Day, &s;hort in Duration, much enlivening, and called in that Country <HI>Gleams of Amu&s;ement.</HI> Within a
<PB N="197" REF="201">&s;hort while the&s;e Gleams began to appear more frequent, and then brighter and of a longer Continuance; the <HI>Sighs</HI> that hitherto filled the Air with &s;o much Dolefulne&s;s, altered to the Sound of common Breezes, and in general the Horrors of the I&s;land were abated.</P>
<P>When we had arrived at la&s;t at the Ford by which we were to pa&s;s out, we met with tho&s;e fa&s;hionable Mourners who had been fer|ried over along with us, and who being un|willing to go as far as we, had coa&s;ted by the Shore to find the Place, where they waited our coming; that by &s;hewing them&s;elves to the World only at that time when we did, they might &s;eem al&s;o to have been among the trou|bles of the Grotto. Here the Waters, that rolled on the other &s;ide &s;o deep and &s;ilent, were much dried up, and it was an ea&s;ier Mat|ter for us to wade over.</P>
<P>The River being cro&s;&s;ed, we were received upon the further Bank by our Friends and Acquaintance, whom <HI>Comfort</HI> had brought out to congratulate our Appearance in the World again. Some of the&s;e blamed us for &s;taying &s;o long away from them, others advi&s;|ed us again&s;t all Temptations of going back again; every one was cautious not to renew our Trouble, by asking any Particulars of the Journey; and all concluded, that in a Ca&s;e
<PB N="198" REF="202">of &s;o much Affliction, we could not have made choice of a fitter Companion than <HI>Patience.</HI> Here <HI>Patience,</HI> appearing &s;e|rene at her Prai&s;es, delivered us over to <HI>Com|fort. Comfort</HI> &s;miled at his receiving the Charge; immediately the Sky purpled on that &s;ide to which he turned, and double Day at once broke in upon me.</P>

<P>I Was con&s;idering la&s;t Night, when I could not &s;leep, how noble a Part of the Creation Man was de&s;ign'd to be, and how di&s;tingui&s;hed in all his Actions above other Earthly Creatures. From whence I fell to take a view of the Change and Corruption which he has introduced into his own Condition, the groveling Appetites, the mean Characters of Sen&s;e, and wild Cour&s;es of Pa&s;&s;ions, that ca&s;t him from the Degree in which Provi|dence had placed him, the deba&s;ing him&s;elf with Qualifications not his own, and his degenerating
<PB N="200" REF="204">into a lower Sphere of Action. This in&s;pired me with a mixture of Contempt and Anger; which however, was not &s;o violent as to hinder the Re|turn of Sleep, but grew confu&s;ed as that came upon me, and made me end my Reflections with giving Mankind the opprobrious Names of Incon|&s;iderate, Mad and Fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>Here methought, where my waking Rea&s;on left the Subject, my Fancy pur&s;ued it in a Dream; and I imagined my &s;elf in a loud Soliloquy of Pa&s;&s;ion, railing at my Species, and walking hard to get rid of the Company I de&s;pi&s;ed; when two Men who had over-heard me made up on either hand. The&s;e I ob&s;erved had many Features in common, which might occa&s;ion the Mi&s;take of the one for the o|ther in tho&s;e to whom they appear &s;ingle, but I, who &s;aw them together, could ea&s;ily perceive, that tho' there was an Air of Severity in each, it was tempered with a natural Sweetne&s;s in the one, and by turns con&s;trained or ruffled by the De&s;igns of Malice in the other.</P>
<P>I was at a lo&s;s to know the Rea&s;on of their joining me &s;o briskly, when he who&s;e Appear|ance di&s;plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, thus addre&s;&s;ed his Com|panion. Pray, Brother, let him alone, and we &s;hall immediately &s;ee him transformed into a Tyger. This &s;truck me with Horror, which the other perceived, and pitying my Di&s;order, bid me be of good Courage, for tho' I had been Savage in my Treatment of Mankind, (whom I &s;hould ra|ther
<PB N="201" REF="205">reform than rail again&s;t) he would, how|ever, endeavour to re&s;cue me from my Danger. At this I looked a little more chearful, and while I te&s;tified my Re&s;ignation to him, we &s;aw the an|gry Brother fling away from us in a Pa&s;&s;ion for his Di&s;appointment. Being now left to my Friend, I went back with him at his De&s;ire, that I might know the Meaning of tho&s;e Words which &s;o affrighted me.</P>
<P>As we went along, To inform you, &s;ays he, with whom you have this Adventure, my Name is <HI>Reproof</HI> and his <HI>Reproach,</HI> both born of the &s;ame Mother, but of different Fathers. <HI>Truth</HI> is our common Parent. <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> who &s;aw her, fell in Love with her, and &s;he being plea&s;ed with him, he begat me upon her; but a while af|ter <HI>Enmity</HI> lying in Ambu&s;h for her, became the Father of him whom you &s;aw along with me. The Temper of our Mother enclines us to the &s;ame &s;ort of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the informing Mankind of their Faults; but the differing Complexions of our Fathers make us differ in our De&s;igns and Company. I have a natural Benevolence in my Mind which engages me with Friends, and he a natural Impetuo&s;ity in his, which ca&s;ts him a|mong Enemies.</P>
<P>As he thus di&s;cour&s;ed we came to a Place where there were three Entrances into as many &s;everal Walks, which lay be&s;ide one another. We
<PB N="202" REF="206">pa&s;&s;ed into the middlemo&s;t, a plain, &s;trait, regular Walk, &s;et with Trees, which added to the Beau|ty of the Place, but did not &s;o clo&s;e their Boughs over head as to exclude the Light from it. Here as we walked I was made to ob&s;erve, how the Road on one hand was full of Rocks and Preci|pices, over which <HI>Reproach</HI> (who had already gotten thither) was furiou&s;ly driving unhappy Wretches; the other &s;ide was all laid out in Gar|dens of gaudy Tulips, among&s;t who&s;e Leaves the Serpents wreath'd, and at the end of every gra&s;&s;y Walk the Enchantre&s;s <HI>Flattery</HI> was weaving Bowers to lull Souls a&s;leep in. We continued &s;till walking on the middle way, 'till we arrived in a Building in which it terminated. This was for|merly erected by <HI>Truth</HI> for a Watch Tower, from whence &s;he took a View of the Earth, and, as &s;he &s;aw occa&s;ion, &s;ent out <HI>Reproof,</HI> or even <HI>Re|proach,</HI> for our Reformation. Over the Door I took notice that a Face was carved with a Heart upon the Lips of it, and pre&s;ently call'd to Mind that this was the Antients Emblem of <HI>Sincerity.</HI> In the Entrance I met with <HI>Freedom of Speech</HI> and <HI>Complai&s;ance,</HI> who had for a long time look|ed upon one another as Enemies; but <HI>Reproof</HI> has &s;o happily brought them together, that they now act as Friends and Fellow-Agents in the &s;ame Fa|mily. Before I a&s;cended up the Stairs, I had my Eyes purified by a Water which made me &s;ee ex|tremely clear, and I think they &s;aid it &s;prung in a Pit, from whence (as <HI>Democritus</HI> had reported)
<PB N="203" REF="207">they formerly brought up <HI>Truth,</HI> who had hid her &s;elf in it. I was then admitted to the upper Chamber of Pro&s;pect, which was called <HI>the Knowledge of Mankind;</HI> here the Window was no &s;ooner opened but I perceived the Clouds to roll off and part before me, and a Scene of all the Variety of the World pre&s;ented it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But how different was Mankind in this View, from what it u&s;ed to appear! Methought the very Shape of mo&s;t of them was lo&s;t; &s;ome had the Heads of Dogs, others of Apes or Parrots, and in &s;hort, where-ever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy Qualities of other Creatures, the Change of his Soul became vi&s;ible in his Coun|tenance. The &s;trutting Pride of him who is en|dued with Brutality in&s;tead of Courage, made his Face &s;hoot out in the Form of a <HI>Hor&s;e</HI>'s; his Eyes became prominent, his No&s;trils widened, and his Wig untying flowed down on one &s;ide of his Neck in a waving Mane. The Talkativene&s;s of tho&s;e who love the ill Nature of Conver&s;ation made them turn into <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> of <HI>Gee&s;e,</HI> their Lips hardened into Bills by eternal u&s;ing, they gabbled for Diver&s;ion, they hi&s;s'd in Scandal, and their Ruffles falling back on their Arms, a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of little Feathers appeared, which formed Wings for them to flutter with from one Vi&s;it to another. The Envious and Malicious lay on the Ground with the Heads of different &s;orts of Ser|pents, and not endeavouring to erect them&s;elves,
<PB N="204" REF="208">but meditating Mi&s;chief to others, they &s;uck'd the Poi&s;on of the Earth, &s;harpened their Tongues to Stings upon the Stones, and rolled their Trains unperceivably beneath their Habits. The Hy|pocritical Oppre&s;&s;ors wore the Faces of Croco|diles, their Mouths were In&s;truments of Cruelty, their Eyes of Deceit; they committed Wicked|ne&s;s, and bemoaned that there &s;hould be &s;o much of it in the World; they devoured the Un|wary, and wept over the Remains of them. The Covetous had &s;o hook'd and worn their Fingers by counting Intere&s;t upon Intere&s;t, that they con|verted to the Claws of Harpies, and the&s;e they &s;till were &s;tretching out for more, yet &s;eem'd un|&s;atisfied with their Acqui&s;itions. The Sharpers had the Looks of Camelions; they every Minute changed their Appearance, and fed on Swarms of Flies which fell as &s;o many Cullies among&s;t them. The Bully &s;eem'd a Dunghil Cock, he cre&s;ted well, and bore his Comb aloft; he was beaten by almo&s;t every one, yet &s;till &s;ung for Tri|umph; and only the mean Coward prick'd up the Ears of a Hare to fly before him. Criticks were turned into Cats, who&s;e Plea&s;ure and Grum|bling go together. Fops were Apes in embroi|der'd Jackets. Flatterers were curl'd Spaniels, fawning and crouching. The Crafty had the Face of a Fox, the Slothful of an A&s;s, the Cru|el of a Wolf, the Ill-bred of a Bear, the Leach|ers were Goats, and the Gluttons Swine. Drun|kenne&s;s was the only Vice that did not change the
<PB N="205" REF="209">Face of its Profe&s;&s;ors into that of another Crea|ture; but this I took to be far from a Privilege, for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons; becau&s;e it &s;ufficiently deforms them of it &s;elf, and becau&s;e none of the lower Ranks of Beings is guilty of &s;o fooli&s;h an Intem|perance.</P>
<P>As I was taking a View of the&s;e Repre&s;entati|ons of Things, without any more Order than is u&s;ual in a Dream, or in the Confu&s;ion of the World it &s;elf, I perceived a Concern within me for what I &s;aw; my Eyes began to moi&s;ten, and as if the Virtue of that Water with which they were purified was lo&s;t for a time, by their being touched with that which aro&s;e from a Pa&s;&s;ion, the Clouds immediately began to gather again, and clo&s;e from either hand upon the Pro&s;pect. I then turned towards my Guide, who addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me after this manner. You have &s;een the Condition of Mankind when it de&s;cends from its Dignity; now therefore guard your &s;elf from that Degeneracy by a mode&s;t Greatne&s;s of Spirit on one &s;ide, and a con&s;cious Shame on the other. Endeavour al&s;o with a Genero&s;ity of Goodne&s;s to make your Friends aware of it; let them know what Defects you perceive are growing upon them; handle the Matter as you &s;ee Rea&s;on, either with the Airs of &s;evere or humorous Affection; &s;ome|times plainly de&s;cribing the Degeneracy in its full proper Colours, or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun,
<PB N="206" REF="210">you give them to &s;uch a Day or &s;o many Months to turn Bears, Wolves, or Foxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Neither neglect your more remote Acquaintance, where you &s;ee any worthy and &s;u&s;ceptible of Admoniti|on; expo&s;e the Bea&s;ts who&s;e Qualities you &s;ee them putting on, where you have no mind to en|gage with their Per&s;ons. The Po&s;&s;ibility of their applying this is very obvious: The <HI>Egyptians</HI> &s;aw it &s;o clearly, that they made the Pictures of Ani|mals explain their Minds to one another in&s;tead of Writing; and indeed it is hardly to be mi&s;&s;ed, &s;ince <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> took them out of their Mute Con|dition, and taught them to &s;peak for them&s;elves with relation to the Actions of Mankind.</P>

<P>THERE is a Sett of Mankind, who are wholly employed in the Ill-natured Office of gathering up a Collection of Stories that le&s;&s;en the Reputation of others, and &s;preading them A|broad with a certain Air of Satisfaction. Perhaps, indeed, an innocent and unmeaning Curio&s;ity, a De&s;ire of being informed concerning tho&s;e we live with, or a Willingne&s;s to profit by Reflecti|on upon the Actions of others, may &s;ometimes afford an Excu&s;e, or &s;ometimes a Defence, for In|qui&s;itivene&s;s; but certainly it is beyond all Ex|cu&s;e,
<PB N="208" REF="212">a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t Humanity, to carry the Matter further, to tear off the Dre&s;&s;ings, as I may &s;ay, from the Wounds of a Friend, and expo&s;e them to the Air in cruel Fits of Diver&s;ion; and yet we have &s;omething more to bemoan, an Outrage of an higher Nature, which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to &s;pread the Stories of Folly, Frailty and Vice, but even en|large them, or invent new ones, and blacken Characters that we may appear ridiculous or hate|ful to one another. From &s;uch Practices as the&s;e it happens, that &s;ome feel a Sorrow, and others are agitated with a Spirit of Revenge; that Scan|dals or Lies are told, becau&s;e another has told &s;uch before; that Re&s;entments and Quarrels ari&s;e, and Injuries are given, received, and multiplied, in a Scene of Vengeance.</P>
<P>All this I have often ob&s;erved with abundance of Concern; and having a perfect De&s;ire to further the Happine&s;s of Mankind; I lately &s;et my &s;elf to con&s;ider the Cau&s;es from whence &s;uch Evils ari&s;e, and the Remedies which may be applied. Where|upon I &s;hut my Eyes to prevent Di&s;traction from outward Objects, and a while after &s;hot away, up|on an Impul&s;e of Thought, into the <HI>World of Ideas,</HI> where ab&s;tracted Qualities became vi&s;ible in &s;uch Appearances as were agreeable to each of their Natures.</P>
<P>That part of the Country, where I happened
<PB N="209" REF="213">to light, was the mo&s;t noi&s;y that I had ever known. The Winds whi&s;tled, the Leaves ru&s;tled, the Brooks rumbled, the Birds chatter'd, the Tongues of Men were heard, and the Echo mingled &s;omething of every Sound in its Repetition, &s;o that there was a &s;trange Confu&s;ion and Uproar of Sounds about me. At length, as the Noi&s;e &s;till encrea&s;ed, I could di&s;cern a Man habited like a Herald (and as I afterwards under&s;tood) called <HI>Novelty,</HI> that came forward proclaiming a Solemn Day to be kept at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Common Fame.</HI> Immediately behind him advanced three Nymphs, who had mon&s;trous Appearances. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> habited like a Virgin, and having an hundred Ears upon her Head to &s;erve in her Enquiries. The Second of the&s;e was <HI>Talkativene&s;s,</HI> a little better grown, &s;he &s;eemed to be like a young Wife, and had an hundred Tongues to &s;pread her Stories. The Third was <HI>Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> habited like a Widow, and &s;urrounded with an hundred Squinting Eyes of a malignant Influence, which &s;o obliquely darted on all around, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay which of them had brought in the Informations &s;he boa&s;ted of. The&s;e, as I was informed, had been very in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving and rearing <HI>Common Fame,</HI> when upon her Birth-day &s;he was &s;huffled into a Crowd, to e&s;cape the &s;earch which <HI>Truth</HI> might have made after her and her Parents. <HI>Curio&s;ity</HI> found her there, <HI>Talkativene&s;s</HI> convey'd her away, and <HI>Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;o nur&s;ed her up,
<PB N="210" REF="214">that in a &s;hort time &s;he grew to a prodigious Size, and obtained an Empire over the Univer&s;e; where|fore the <HI>Power,</HI> in Gratitude for the&s;e Services, has &s;ince advanced them to her highe&s;t Employ|ments. The next who came forward in this Pro|ce&s;&s;ion was a light Dam&s;el, called <HI>Credulity,</HI> who carried behind them the Lamp, the Silver Ve&s;&s;el with a Spout, and other In&s;truments proper for this Solemn Occa&s;ion. She had formerly &s;een the&s;e three together, and conjecturing from the number of their Ears, Tongues and Eyes, that they might be the proper <HI>Genii</HI> of <HI>Attention, Fa|miliar Conver&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Ocular Demon&s;tration,</HI> &s;he from that time gave her &s;elf up to attend them. The la&s;t who followed were &s;ome who had clo&s;e|ly muffled them&s;elves in upper Garments, &s;o that I could not di&s;cern who they were; but ju&s;t as the foremo&s;t of them was come up, I am glad, &s;ays &s;he, calling me by my Name, to meet you at this time, &s;tay clo&s;e by me, and take a &s;trict Ob|&s;ervation of all that pa&s;&s;es. Her Voice was &s;weet and commanding, I thought I had &s;omewhere heard it; and from her, as I went along, I learn|ed the Meaning of every thing which offered.</P>
<P>We now marched forward thro' the <HI>Rookery</HI> of <HI>Rumours,</HI> which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us. At length we arrived at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Common Fame,</HI> where a Hecatomb of <HI>Repu|tations</HI> was that Day to fall for her Plea&s;ure. The Hou&s;e &s;tood upon an Eminence, having a thou|&s;and
<PB N="211" REF="215">Pa&s;&s;ages to it, and a thou&s;and whi&s;pering Holes for the Conveyance of Sound. The Hall we entered was formed with the Art of a Mu&s;ick-Chamber for the Improvement of Noi&s;es. <HI>Re&s;t</HI> and <HI>Silence</HI> are bani&s;hed the Place. <HI>Stories</HI> of different Natures wander in light Flocks all about, &s;ometimes Truths and Lies, or &s;ometimes Lies them&s;elves cla&s;hing again&s;t one another. In the mid|dle &s;tood a Table painted after the manner of the remote&s;t <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Countries, upon which the Lamp, the Silver Ve&s;&s;el, and Cups of a white Earth, were planted in order. Then dried Herbs were brought, collected for the Solemnity in Moon&s;hine, and Water being put to them, there was a greeni&s;h Liquor made, to which they added the Flower of Milk, and an Extraction from the Canes of <HI>America,</HI> for performing a Libation to the infer|nal <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Mi&s;chief.</HI> After this, <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> retiring to a withdrawing-Room, brought forth the <HI>Victims,</HI> being to Appearance a Sett of &s;mall waxen Images, which &s;he laid upon the Table one after another. Immediately <HI>Talkative|ne&s;s</HI> gave each of them the Name of &s;ome one, whom for the Time they were to repre&s;ent; and <HI>Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;tuck them all about with black Pins, &s;till pronouncing at every one &s;he &s;tuck, &s;omething to the Prejudice of the Per&s;ons repre|&s;ented. No &s;ooner were the&s;e Rites performed, and Incantations uttered, but the Sound of a Speak|ing Trumpet was heard in the Air, by which they knew the <HI>Deity</HI> of the Place was propitiated and
<PB N="212" REF="216">a&s;&s;i&s;ting. Upon this the Sky grew darker, a Storm aro&s;e, and Murmurs, Sighs, Groans, Cries, and the Words of Grief or Re&s;entment were heard within it. Thus the three <HI>Sorcere&s;&s;es</HI> di&s;|covered, that they, who&s;e Names they had given to the Images, were already affected with what was done to them in Effigie. The Knowledge of this was received with loude&s;t the Laughter, and in many Congratulatory Words they applauded one another's Wit and Power.</P>
<P>As Matters were at this high Point of Di&s;|order, the muffled Lady, whom I attended on, being no longer able to endure &s;uch barba|rous Proceedings, threw off her upper Gar|ment of <HI>Re&s;erve,</HI> and appeared to be <HI>Truth.</HI> As &s;oon as &s;he had confe&s;&s;ed her &s;elf pre&s;ent, the Speaking-Trumpet ceas'd to Sound, the Sky clear|ed up, the Storm abated, the Noi&s;es which were heard in it ended, the Laughter of the Company was over, and a &s;erene Light, till then unknown to the Place, was diffu&s;ed around it. At this the de|tected <HI>Sorcere&s;&s;es</HI> endeavoured to e&s;cape in a Cloud which I &s;aw began to thicken about them, but it was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, their Charms being controled and prevailed over by the &s;uperior <HI>Divinity.</HI> For my Part I was exceedingly glad to &s;ee it &s;o, and be|gan to con&s;ider what Puni&s;hments &s;he would in|flict upon them. I fancied it would be proper to cut off <HI>Curio&s;ity</HI>'s Ears, and fix them to the Eaves of Hou&s;es, to nail the Tongue of <HI>Talkativene&s;s</HI> to
<PB N="213" REF="217"><HI>Indian</HI> Tables, and to put out the Eyes of <HI>Cen&s;o|riou&s;ne&s;s</HI> with a Fla&s;h of her Light. In re&s;pect of <HI>Credulity</HI> I had indeed &s;ome little Pity, and had I been Judge &s;he might, perhaps, have e&s;caped with a hearty Reproof.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon found that the di&s;cerning <HI>Judge</HI> had other De&s;igns, &s;he knew them for &s;uch as will not be de&s;troyed intirely while Mankind is in Be|ing, and yet ought to have a Brand and Puni&s;h|ment affixed to them that they may be avoided. Wherefore &s;he took a Seat for Judgment, and had the <HI>Criminals</HI> brought forward by <HI>Shame</HI> ever blu&s;hing, and <HI>Trouble</HI> with a Whip of many La&s;hes, two Phantoms who had dogged the Pro|ce&s;&s;ion in Di&s;gui&s;e, and waited 'till they had an Authority from <HI>Truth</HI> to lay Hands upon them. Immediately then &s;he ordered <HI>Curio&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Talk|ativene&s;s</HI> to be fettered together, that the one &s;hould never &s;uffer the other to re&s;t, nor the other ever let her remain undi&s;covered. Light <HI>Credu|lity</HI> &s;he linkt to <HI>Shame</HI> at the Tormenter's own Reque&s;t, who was plea&s;ed to be thus &s;ecure that her Pri&s;oner could not e&s;cape; and this was done partly for her Puni&s;hment, and partly for her A|mendment. <HI>Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was al&s;o in like man|ner begged by <HI>Trouble,</HI> and had her a&s;&s;ign'd for an eternal Companion. After they were thus chain'd with one another, by the Judge's Order, &s;he drove them from the Pre&s;ence to wander for ever thro' the World, with <HI>Novelty</HI> &s;talking before them.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="218">The Cau&s;e being now over, &s;he retreated from &s;ight within the Splendor of her own Glory, which leaving the Hou&s;e it had brightned, the Sounds that were proper to the Place began to be as loud and confu&s;ed as when we entered, and there being no longer a clear di&s;tingui&s;hed Appearance of any Objects repre&s;ented to me, I returned from the Excur&s;ion I had made in Fancy.</P>

<P>WHatever Indu&s;try and Eagerne&s;s the mo|dern Di&s;coverers have &s;hewn for the Knowledge of new Countries, there yet remains an ample Field in the Creation to which they are utter Strangers, and which all the Methods of Travelling hitherto invented, will never bring them acquainted with. Of this I can give a very particular In&s;tance in an Accident which lately happened to me.</P>
<P>As I was on the 6^t^h of this In&s;tant, being <HI>Febr.</HI> 1715, walking with my Eyes ca&s;t up|ward, I fell into a Reflection on the va&s;t Tracts of Air which appear'd before me as uninha|bited.
<PB N="216" REF="220">And wherefore, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, &s;hou'd all this Space be created? Can it only be for an odd Bird to fly through, as now and then a Man may pa&s;s a De&s;art? Or are there al&s;o Kingdoms with their particular Polities, and People of a Species which we know nothing of, ordain'd to live in it.</P>
<P>It was in this Manner I continued my Thought, when my Feet for&s;ook the Level, and I was in&s;en&s;ibly mounted in the Air, till I arriv'd at a footing as firm and level as what I had left. But with what Surpri&s;e did I find my &s;elf a|mong Creatures di&s;tinct from us in Shape and Cu&s;toms?</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are of a &s;mall Stature, be|low tho&s;e which Hi&s;tory de&s;cribes for Pigmies. The talle&s;t of them exceed not fourteen or fif|teen Inches, and the lea&s;t are hardly three. This difference proceeds only from their Growth before they are brought to Light; for after we never ob&s;erve them to grow, unle&s;s it plea&s;e their Parents, who have this uncommon Me|thod of enabling them: They recall them to the Womb, where having been for &s;ome Time, they receive an Addition to their Bulk, then go back to their Hou&s;es, and continue at a Stand as they did before. The Experiment has been often try'd with Succe&s;s, but &s;ome have &s;uffered extremely by undergoing it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="221">Their Skins are like the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> all drawn over with a Variety of Figures. The Colour made u&s;e of for this end, is generally Black. I have indeed ob&s;erv'd in &s;ome of the Religious, and Lawyers of the Country, Red here and there intermingl'd, tho' not &s;o com|monly of late. They tell me too, they often us'd to paint with all Colours; and I vi&s;ited two or three of the old Inhabitants, who were adorn'd in that Fa&s;hion: But this is now di&s;|u&s;ed, &s;ince the new Inventions, by which the u&s;e of a black Fountain that belongs to that Country, is render'd more u&s;eful and &s;ervice|able.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cloaths</HI> in which they go clad, are the Skins of Bea&s;ts, worn by &s;ome Plain, by others with Figures wrought upon them. Gold is al&s;o made u&s;e of by &s;ome, to beautify their Apparel; but very &s;eldom Silver, unle&s;s, as Buckles are by us, for fa&s;tening the Garment before. I have &s;een &s;ome of them go like Seamen in thin blue Shirts, others like <HI>Indians</HI> in a party-colour'd loo&s;e kind of Apparel, and others who they told me were the <HI>Politicians</HI> of the Country, go about &s;tark naked.</P>
<P>The Manner of dre&s;&s;ing them is this: At fir&s;t when they come into the World, they have a Suit given them, which if it do not fit
<PB N="218" REF="222">exactly, is not, as with us, fitted up again, but the Children are in a cruel Manner cut and &s;queez'd to bring them to its Proportion. Yet this they &s;eem not much to regard, provided their principal Parts are not affected. When the Dre&s;s is thus &s;ettled on them, they are clad for Life, it being &s;eldom their Cu&s;tom to alter it, or put it off: In &s;hort, they live in it Night and Day, and wear it to Rags rather than part with it, being &s;ure of the &s;ame Tor|ture, and a greater Danger if they &s;hou'd be dre&s;s'd a &s;econd Time. I have further taken Notice, that they delight to go open Brea&s;ted, mo&s;t of them &s;hewing their Bo&s;oms &s;peckled. Some <HI>Lawyers</HI> indeed wear them quite White, perhaps for Di&s;tinction &s;ake, or to be known at a Di&s;tance. But the fine&s;t Shew, is among the Beaux and Ladies, who mightily affect &s;omething of Gold, both before and behind them.</P>
<P><HI>Food</HI> I never &s;aw them eat; they being a People, who, as I ob&s;erved, live in Air: Their <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> are all &s;ingle and high, having no back Rooms, but frequently &s;even or eight Stories, which are all &s;eparate Hou&s;es above one ano|ther. They have one Gate to their City, and generally no Doors to their Hou&s;es; tho' I have &s;ometimes &s;een them have particular Doors, and even made of Gla&s;s, where the In|habitants have been ob&s;erv'd to &s;tand many
<PB N="219" REF="223">Days, that their fine Apparel may be &s;een thro' them. If at any time they lye down, which they do when they come from their Habitati|ons (as if coming Abroad were their greate&s;t Fa|tigue) they will lie together in Heaps without receiving Hurt: Though the &s;ounde&s;t Sleep they get, is when they can have Du&s;t enough to cover them over.</P>
<P>The Females among&s;t them are but few, nothing being there produced by a Marriage of Sexes. The Males are of a different Strength or Endowment of Parts, &s;ome having Know|ledge in an extream Degree, and others none at all; yet at the &s;ame Time, they are mighty Pretenders to in&s;truct others. Their <HI>Names,</HI> (for as many as wou'd di&s;cover them to me) I ob&s;erv'd to be the very &s;ame as ours are upon Earth; I met a few who made theirs a My|&s;tery, but why, I am yet to learn. They are &s;o communicative, that they will tell all the Knowledge they boa&s;t, if a Stranger apply him|&s;elf to their Conver&s;ation: And this may be worth his while, if he con&s;iders that all Lan|guages, Arts, and Sciences, are profe&s;t among&s;t them. I think I may &s;ay it without Vanity, that I knew a certain <HI>Tali&s;man,</HI> with proper Figures and Characters in&s;crib'd, whereby their greate&s;t People may be charm'd, brought to re&s;ide with a Man, and &s;erve him like a Fami|liar in the Conduct of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="224">There is no &s;uch thing as <HI>fighting</HI> among&s;t them, but their Controver&s;ies are determin'd by <HI>Words,</HI> wherein they &s;eldom own them&s;elves conquer'd, yet proceed no further than two or three Replies: Perhaps indeed two others take up their Neighbour's Quarrel, but then they de|&s;i&s;t too after the &s;ame Manner; &s;ometimes how|ever, Blows have en&s;u'd upon their Account, though not among&s;t them: In &s;uch a Ca&s;e they have de&s;cended to in&s;pire Mankind with their Sentiments, and cho&s;en Champions from among us, in order to decide it.</P>
<P>The Time of their <HI>Life</HI> is very different, &s;ome dye as &s;oon as born, and others in their Youth; &s;ome get a new Lea&s;e of Life by their entring into the Womb again, and if any weather it out to a hundred Years, they generally live on to an extreme Age. After which it is remarkable, that in&s;tead of growing weaker as we do, by Time, they increa&s;e in Strength, and become at la&s;t &s;o confirm'd in Health, that it is the Opini|on of their Country, they never can peri&s;h while the World remains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sickne&s;&s;es</HI> which may take them off, be&s;ides what happens from their natural Weakne&s;s of Body, are of different Sorts. One is <HI>over-moi&s;|ture,</HI> which affecting their Man&s;ions, makes them lo&s;e their Complexions, become deform'd, and
<PB N="221" REF="225">rot away in&s;en&s;ibly: This is often obviated by their not keeping too much within Doors. An|other is the <HI>Worms,</HI> which prey upon their Bow|els: If they be maim'd by Accidents, they be|come, like us, &s;o far u&s;ele&s;s; and that Maim will &s;ome time or other be the Occa&s;ion of their Ruin. However, they peri&s;h by the&s;e Means only in Appearance, and like Spirits, who vani&s;h in one Place, to be &s;een in another. But as Men dye of Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o <HI>Di&s;e&s;teem</HI> is what the mo&s;t near|ly touches them; then they withdraw into, Holes and Corners, and con&s;ume away in Darkne&s;s. Or if they are kept alive a few Days by the force of <HI>Spices,</HI> it is but a &s;hort Reprieve from their peri&s;hing to Eternity; without any Honour, but that in&s;tead of a Burial, a &s;mall Pyre of <HI>Pa&s;t</HI> &s;hou'd be erected over them, while they, like the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> are reduc'd to A&s;hes.</P>
