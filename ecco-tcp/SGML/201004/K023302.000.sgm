<P><HI>London, (to wit)</HI> BE it remembered, that Sir Archibald Macdonald, Knight, Attorney General of our pre&s;ent Sovereign Lord King George the Third, who, for our pre&s;ent Sovereign Lord the King, pro&s;ecutes in this behalf in his own proper per|&s;on, comes into the court of our &s;aid pre&s;ent Sovereign Lord the King, before the King him|&s;elf at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the county of Middle|&s;ex, on Friday next, after one month from the fea&s;t day of Ea&s;ter in this &s;ame term; and for our &s;aid Lord the King giveth the court here to under&s;tand and be informed, that THOMAS PAINE, late of London, gentleman, being a wicked, malicious, &s;editious, and ill-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on, and being greatly di&s;affected to our &s;aid Sovereign Lord the now King, and to the hap|py con&s;titution and government of this king|dom, and mo&s;t unlawfully, wickedly, &s;edi|tiou&s;ly, and maliciou&s;ly devi&s;ing, contriving, and intending to &s;candalize, traduce, and vi|lify, the late happy Revolution, providentially brought about and effected under the wi&s;e and prudent conduct of his Highne&s;s William, here|tofore Prince of Orange, and afterwards King of England, France, and Ireland, and the do|minions thereunto belonging; and the accep|tance of the Crown and royal dignity of King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, by his &s;aid Highne&s;s William, and her Highne&s;s Mary,

<PB N="6" REF="5">Work, entitled Common Sen&s;e, and the Fir&s;t Part of the Rights of Man, the Second Edi|tion, London, printed for J. S. Jordan, No. 166, Fleet Street, 1792;</Q> in which &s;aid libel are contained, among&s;t other things, di|vers fal&s;e, &s;candalous, malicious, and &s;editious, matters. In one part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, that is to &s;ay, <Q>All hereditary government is in its nature ty|ranny. An heritable crown</Q> (meaning, among&s;t others, the crown of this kingdom) <Q>or an heritable throne,</Q> (meaning, among&s;t others, the throne of this kingdom) <Q>or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explana|tion than that mankind are heritable pro|perty. To inherit a government, is to in|herit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</Q> And in another part thereof, ac|cording to the tenor and effect following, (that is to &s;ay) <Q>This Convention met at Philadel|phia, in May, 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time connected with any of the State Governments, or with Congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private ci|tizen. The Convention went deeply into all the &s;ubjects, and having, after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a Fe|deral Con&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was the manner of giving it authority and prac|tice. For this purpo&s;e, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadt|holder
<PB N="7" REF="6">or a German Elector, but they refer|red the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and inte|re&s;t of the country,</Q> (thereby meaning and intending that it &s;hould be believed that a cabal of courtiers had &s;ent for the &s;aid Prince of Orange and King George the Fir&s;t, heretofore Elector of Hanover, to take upon them&s;elves re&s;pectively the regal government of the &s;aid kingdom and dominions, without referring to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the &s;ubjects of the &s;aid kingdoms.) And in another part thereof, according to the te|nor and effect following, that is to &s;ay, <Q>The hi&s;|tory of the Edwards and the Henries</Q> (mean|ing Edwards and Henries, heretofore Kings of England) <Q>and up to the commencement of the Stuarts,</Q> (meaning Stuarts, heretofore Kings of England) <Q>exhibits as many in&s;tances of ty|ranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had re&s;tricted it. The Stuarts</Q> (meaning Stuarts, heretofore Kings of England) <Q>endeavoured to pa&s;s the&s;e limits, and their fate is well known. In all tho&s;e in&s;tances, we &s;ee nothing of a con&s;titution, but only of re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power. After this, another William,</Q> (meaning the &s;aid William Prince of Orange, afterwards King of England) <Q>de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and claiming from the &s;ame origin, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</Q> (meaning po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown of England) <Q>and of the two evils, <HI>James</HI> and <HI>William,</HI></Q> (meaning James the Second, heretofore King of England, and the &s;aid William Prince of Orange, afterwards King of England) <Q>the nation preferred what it
<PB N="8" REF="7">thought the lea&s;t; &s;ince from circum&s;tances it mu&s;t take one. The act called the Bill of Rights</Q> (meaning the &s;aid act of Parliament intituled, "an act declaring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, and &s;ettling the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the crown) <Q>comes here into view; what is it</Q> (meaning the &s;aid act of Parliament la&s;t mentioned) <Q>but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits and privileges?</Q> (mean|ing that the &s;aid la&s;t-mentioned act of Parliament was a bargain which the parts of the govern|ment in England made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges. <Q>You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I will have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the nation it &s;aid, <HI>for your &s;hare</HI> YOU <HI>&s;hall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, the Bill of Rights</Q> (mean|ing the &s;aid la&s;t-mentioned act of Parliament) <Q>is more properly a Bill of Wrongs and of in|&s;ult; as to what is called the Convention Par|liament, it</Q> (meaning the &s;aid Convention of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons herein before mentioned) <Q>was a thing that made it&s;elf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few per&s;ons got together, and called them&s;elves by that name; &s;everal of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpo&s;e. From the time of William,</Q> (meaning the &s;aid King William the Third) <Q>a &s;pecies of government aro&s;e, i&s;|&s;uing out of this coalition Bill of Rights;</Q> (meaning the &s;aid act, intituled, "an act, de|claring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, and &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown) <Q>and
<PB N="9" REF="8">more &s;o &s;ince the corruption introduced at the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</Q> (meaning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Heirs of the Prince&s;s Sophia, Electre&s;s and Dutche&s;s Dowager of Hanover to the crown and dignity of this kingdom) <Q>by the agency of Walpole, that</Q> (meaning the &s;aid &s;pe|cies of government) <Q>can be de&s;cribed by no other name than a de&s;potic legi&s;lation. Though the parts may embarra&s;s each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of it&s;elf is the right of peti|tioning. Where then is the con&s;titution either that gives or that re&s;trains power? It is not becau&s;e a part of the government</Q> (meaning the government of this kingdom) <Q>is elective, that makes it le&s;s a de&s;poti&s;m, if the per&s;ons &s;o elected po&s;&s;e&s;s afterwards, as a parliament, unlimited powers; election in this ca&s;e becomes &s;eparated from repre&s;entation, and the candidates are candidates for de&s;poti&s;m.</Q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to &s;ay) <Q>The attention of the government of England (for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name than the Engli&s;h government) appears, &s;ince its political connection with Germany, to have been &s;o com|pletely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign af|fairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic con|cerns are neglected; and with re&s;pect to regular laws, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing;</Q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to &s;ay) <Q>With re&s;pect to the two hou&s;es of which the Engli&s;h Par|liament</Q>
<PB N="10" REF="9">(meaning the Parliament of this king|dom) <Q>is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a Legi&s;lature, to have no temper of its own. The mini&s;ter,</Q> (meaning the mini&s;ter employed by the King of this realm in the admini&s;tration of the govern|ment thereof) <Q>whoever he at any time may be, touches it</Q> (meaning the two Hou&s;es of Par|liament of this kingdom) <Q>as with an opium wand; and it</Q> (meaning the two Hou&s;es of Parliament of this kingdom) <Q>&s;leeps obedience. But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two Hou&s;es</Q> (meaning the two Hou&s;es of Par|liament of this kingdom) <Q>the difference will appear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no cer|tainty of the judgement to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England,</Q> (meaning the &s;tate of repre&s;entation of the Commons of this kingdom) <Q>it is manhood compared with what is called the Hou&s;e of Lords;</Q> (meaning the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament a&s;&s;embled) <Q>and &s;o lit|tle is this nick-named Hou&s;e</Q> (meaning the Hou&s;e of Lords) <Q>regarded, that the people &s;carcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It</Q> (meaning the &s;aid Hou&s;e of Lords) <Q>appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t re|moved from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</Q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, viz. <Q>Having thus glanced at &s;ome of the defects of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament,</Q> (meaning the Par|liament of this kingdom) <Q>I proceed to what is called the crown,</Q> (meaning the crown
<PB N="11" REF="10">of this kingdom) <Q>upon which I &s;hall be very conci&s;e. It</Q> (meaning the crown of this kingdom) <Q>&s;ignifies a nominal office of a mil|lion &s;terling a year, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con|&s;i&s;ts in receiving the money, whether the per&s;on</Q> (meaning the King of this realm) <Q>be wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;ane or in&s;ane, a native or a foreigner, matters not, every mini&s;try</Q> (meaning the mini&s;try employed by the King of this realm in the admini&s;tration of the government thereof) <Q>acts upon the &s;ame idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the peo|ple</Q> (meaning the &s;ubjects of this kingdom) <Q>mu&s;t be hoodwinked and held in &s;uper&s;titious ignorance by &s;ome bugbear or other; and what is called the crown</Q> (meaning the crown of this kingdom) <Q>an&s;wers this purpo&s;e, and therefore it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es to be ex|pected from it. This is more than can be &s;aid of the other two branches. The hazard to which this office</Q> (meaning among&s;t others the office of King of this realm) <Q>is expo&s;ed in all countries,</Q> (meaning among&s;t others this kingdom) <Q>is not from any thing that can happen to the man,</Q> (meaning the King) <Q>but from what may happen to the nation,</Q> (mean|ing among&s;t others this kingdom) <Q>the danger of its coming to its &s;en&s;es.</Q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to &s;ay) <Q>I happened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary</Q> (meaning the &s;aid late King William and Queen Mary) <Q>have always appeared to me dete&s;table; the one</Q> (meaning
<PB N="12" REF="11">the &s;aid King William) <Q>&s;eeking to de&s;troy his uncle, and the other</Q> (meaning the &s;aid Queen Mary) <Q>her father, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power them&s;elves; yet as the nation was di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;omething of that event, I felt hurt at &s;eeing it a&s;cribe the whole reputa|tion of it to a man</Q> (meaning the &s;aid late King William the Third) <Q>who had under|taken it as a jobb, and who, be&s;ides what he otherwi&s;e got, charged &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Fir&s;t</Q> (meaning George the Fir&s;t, late King of Great Britain, &amp;c.) <Q>acted the &s;ame clo&s;e-fi&s;ted part as William the Third had done, and bought the Dutchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds over and above his pay as King; and having thus purcha&s;ed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanove|rian Dominions for his own private profit.&mdash; In fact, every nation that does not govern it|&s;elf is governed as a jobb: England has been the prey of jobbs ever &s;ince the revolution.</Q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to &s;ay)&mdash; <Q>The fraud, hypocri&s;y, and impo&s;ition of go|vernments,</Q> (meaning, among&s;t others, the government of this kingdom) <Q>are now begin|ning to be too well under&s;tood to promi&s;e them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dre&s;&s;ing for the funeral. Let it then pa&s;s quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be com|forted.
<PB N="13" REF="12">The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for &s;ending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brun&s;wick, for men,</Q> (meaning the Kings of the&s;e realms, born out of the &s;ame, who have acceded to the crown thereof at and &s;ince the revolution) <Q>at the expence of a million a year, who under|&s;tood neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t; and who&s;e capacities would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of a pari&s;h con|&s;table. If Government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed; and materials fit for all the pur|po&s;es may be found in every town and village in England.</Q> In contempt of our &s;aid Lord the King and his laws, to the evil example of all others in the like ca&s;e offending, and again&s;t the peace of our &s;aid Lord the King, his crown and dignity. And the &s;aid attorney general of our &s;aid Lord the King, for our &s;aid Lord the King, further gives the court here to under&s;tand and be informed, that the &s;aid Thomas Paine, being a wicked, malicious, &s;editious, and ill-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on, and being greatly di&s;affected to our &s;aid Sovereign Lord the now King, and to the happy con&s;titution and government of this kingdom, and mo&s;t unlawfully, wickedly, &s;e|ditiou&s;ly, and maliciou&s;ly devi&s;ing, contriving, and intending to &s;candalize, traduce, and vilify the late happy revolution, providentially brought about and effected under the wi&s;e and prudent conduct of his Highne&s;s William, heretofore Prince of Orange, and afterwards King of England, France, and Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belonging; and the

But, Gentlemen, it &s;o happens that the accu|mulated mi&s;chief which has ari&s;en from the particular book that is now before you, and the con&s;equences, which every body is acquainted with, which have followed from this publica|tion, have rendered it nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, that I &s;hould &s;ay a few words more in the opening

<P>Gentlemen, in the fir&s;t place you will permit me, without the imputation, I think, of &s;peak|ing of my&s;elf,(a very trifling &s;ubject, and al|ways a di&s;gu&s;ting one to others) to obviate a rumour which I have heard, namely, that this pro&s;ecution does not corre&s;pond with my private judgment; that has been &s;aid, and has reached my ears from various quarters. The refutation that I &s;hall give to it is this: That I &s;hould think I de&s;erved to be with di&s;grace expelled from the &s;ituation with which his Maje&s;ty has honoured me in your &s;ervice, and that of all my fellow &s;ubjects, had I, as far as my private judgment goes, he&s;itated for one in&s;tant to bring this enormous offender, as I con&s;ider him, before a Jury of his country.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the publication in que&s;tion was not the fir&s;t of its kind which this defendant &s;ent forth into the world. This particular pub|lication was preceded by one upon the &s;ame &s;ub|jects, and handling, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;ame topics. That publication, although extremely reprehen&s;ible, and &s;uch as, perhaps, I was not entirely warranted in overlooking, I did over|look, upon this principle, that it may not be fitting and prudent at all times, for a public pro&s;ecutor to be &s;harp in his pro&s;ecutions, or to have it &s;aid that he is in&s;trumental in prevent|ing any manner of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion coming under the public eye, although in his own e&s;timation it may be very far indeed from that which is le|gitimate
<PB N="47" REF="46">and proper di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Reprehen&s;ible as that book was, extremely &s;o in my opinion, yet it was u&s;hered into the world under circum|&s;tances that led me to conceive that it would be confined to the judicious reader, and when con|fined to the judicious reader, it appeared to me that &s;uch a man would refute as he went along.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, when I found that another publication was u&s;hered into the world &s;till more reprehen&s;ible than the former, that in all &s;hapes, in all &s;izes, with an indu&s;try incredible; it was either totally or partially thru&s;t into the hands of all per&s;ons in this country, of &s;ubjects of every de&s;cription; when I found that even children's &s;weet-meats were wrapped up with parts of this, and delivered into their hands, in the hope that they would read it, when all indu&s;try was u&s;ed, &s;uch as I de&s;cribe to you, in order to obtrude and force this upon that part of the public who&s;e minds cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be conver&s;ant with &s;ubjects of this &s;ort, and who cannot therefore correct as they go along, I thought it behoved me upon the earlie&s;t occa&s;ion, which was the fir&s;t day of the term &s;ucceeding this publication, to put a charge upon record again&s;t its au|thor.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, permit me to &s;tate to you what it is that I impute to this book, and what is the intention that I impute to the writer of this book. Try it by every te&s;t that the human mind can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;ee whether when tried by all the variety of tho&s;e te&s;ts, you will not be &s;atisfied in the long run, that it does de&s;erve
<PB N="48" REF="47">that de&s;cription which my duty obliges me to give of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in the fir&s;t place I impute to it a wilful, deliberate intention to vilify and degrade, and thereby to bring into abhorrence and con|tempt, the whole con&s;titution of the govern|ment of this country; not as <HI>introduced,</HI> that I will never admit, but as <HI>explained</HI> and <HI>re&s;tored</HI> at the Revolution. That &s;y&s;tem of government under which we this day live, and which if it &s;hall be attacked by contemptuous expre&s;&s;ions, if by dogmatical dicta, if by ready-made propo|&s;itions, offered to the under&s;tandings of men &s;oli|citous about the nature of their con&s;titution, properly &s;o, (God forbid they ever &s;hould be otherwi&s;e) but who, at the &s;ame time, may be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon to their own de&s;truc|tion, they may be brought to have diffidence and even abhorrence (for this book goes all that length) of that which is the &s;alvation of the public, and every thing which is dear to them.</P>
<P>I impute then to this book a deliberate de&s;ign to eradicate from the minds of the people of this country that enthu&s;ia&s;tic love which they have hitherto had for that con&s;titution, and thereby to do the utmo&s;t work of mi&s;chief that any hu|man being can do in this &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, further I impute to it that, <HI>in terms,</HI> the regal part of the government of this country, bounded and limited as it is, is repre|&s;ented as an oppre&s;&s;ive and an abominable tyran|ny.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48"><HI>Thirdly.</HI> That the whole legi&s;lature of this country is directly an u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Again, with re&s;pect to the laws of this realm, which hitherto have been our boa&s;t, indi&s;cri|minately and without one &s;ingle exception, that they are grounded upon this u&s;urped autho|rity, and are therefore in them&s;elves null, or, to u&s;e his own words&mdash;that there is little or no law in this country.</P>
<P>Then, gentlemen, is it to be held out to a community of ten or twelve millions of people, is it to be held out, as well to the lower as to the better informed cla&s;&s;es of the&s;e ten or twelve millions, that there is nothing in this &s;ociety that is binding upon their conduct, excepting &s;uch portion of religion or morality as they may individually and re&s;pectively entertain?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, are we then a lawle&s;s banditti? Have we neither laws to &s;ecure our property, our per&s;ons, or our reputations?&mdash;Is it &s;o that every man's arms are unbound, and that he may do whatever he plea&s;es in the &s;ociety?&mdash; Are we reduced back again to that &s;avage &s;tate of nature? I a&s;k you the que&s;tion! You, gen|tlemen, know well what the an&s;wer is; but, gentlemen, are we to &s;ay, that a man who holds this out to tho&s;e who are not furni&s;hed with the means of giving the an&s;wer which I know you, and every gentleman who hears me at this moment, will give, is di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a que&s;|tion? Can any thing add to his &s;lander upon the con&s;titution; and upon the &s;eparate parts of the government, &s;o con&s;tituted as ours is, more than that &s;weeping imputation upon the whole &s;y&s;tem of law that binds us together&mdash;namely,
<PB N="50" REF="49">that it is null and void, and that there is in reality no &s;uch thing to be found?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages which I &s;hall read to you, I impute this to him; al&s;o, that he u&s;es an artifice gro&s;s to tho&s;e who can ob&s;erve it, but dangerous in the extreme to tho&s;e who&s;e minds perhaps are not &s;ufficiently cultivated and habituated to reading to ena|ble them to di&s;cover it: the artifice, in order to create di&s;gu&s;t, is neither more nor le&s;s than this&mdash;it is &s;tating all the objections that can po&s;&s;ibly be urged to monarchy, &s;eparately and &s;olely con&s;idered, and to pure and &s;imple ari&s;|tocracy; he never chu&s;es to &s;ay a &s;ingle &s;yllable with re&s;pect to tho&s;e two as combined with a democracy, forbearing al&s;o to &s;tate, and in|du&s;triou&s;ly keeping out of the way, every cir|cum&s;tance that regards that wor&s;t of all go|vernments, an unbalanced democracy, which is nece&s;&s;arily pregnant with a democratical ty|ranny. This is the gro&s;s artifice; and when you come to di&s;&s;ect the book in the careful manner that I have done, I believe you and every other reader will ea&s;ily detect that artifice.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, to whom are the po&s;itions that are contained in this book addre&s;&s;ed? They are addre&s;&s;ed, gentlemen, to the ignorant, to the credulous, to the de&s;perate; to the de&s;|parate all government is irk&s;ome, nothing can be &s;o palatable to their ears as the com|fortable doctrine that there is neither law nor government among&s;t us.</P>
<P>The ignorant and the credulous, we all know, to exi&s;t in all countries, and perhaps
<PB N="51" REF="50">exactly in proportion as their hearts are good and &s;imple, are they an ea&s;y prey to the crafty who have the cruelty to deceive them.</P>
<P>Gentlemen in judging of the malignant intention which I mu&s;t impute to this author, you will be plea&s;ed to take into your con&s;ider|ation the phra&s;e and the manner as well as the matter. The phra&s;e I &s;tate to be in&s;idious and artful, the manner in many in&s;tances &s;coffing and contemptuous, a &s;hort argument, often a prevalent one, with the ignorant or the cre|dulous. With re&s;pect to the <HI>matter,</HI> in my con&s;cience I call it trea&s;on, though technically, according to the laws of the country, it is not. &mdash;for, gentlemen, balance the inconvenience to &s;ociety of that which is technically trea&s;on, and in this country, we mu&s;t not, thank God, extend it but keep it within its mo&s;t narrow and circum&s;cribed definitions, but con&s;ider the comparative difference of the mi&s;chief that may happen from &s;preading doctrines of this &s;ort, and that which may happen from any trea&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the utmo&s;t degree of trea&s;on, even perpetrating the death of a prince upon the throne, the law has found the means of &s;upplying that calamity in a manner that may &s;ave the country from any permanent injury. In many periods of the hi&s;tory of this country, which you may ea&s;ily recollect, it is true that the reign of a good prince has been interrupted by violence,&mdash;a great evil!&mdash;but not &s;o great as this: the cha&s;m is filled up in&s;tantly by the con|&s;titution of this country, even if that la&s;t of trea&s;ons &s;hould be committed.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="51">But where is the power upon earth that can fill up the cha&s;m of a con&s;titution that has been growing;&mdash;not for &s;even hundred years, as Mr. Paine would have you believe, from the Norman conque&s;t but from time almo&s;t eternal, impo&s;&s;ible to trace; that has been growing as, from the &s;ymptoms Julius Cae&s;ar ob&s;erved when he found our ance&s;tors nearly &s;avages in the country, has been growing from that period until it was con&s;ummated at the Revolution, and &s;hone forth in all its &s;plendour.</P>
<P>In addition to this, this gentleman thinks fit even to impute to the exi&s;tence of that con&s;ti|tution, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed it the very evils in&s;eparable from human &s;ociety, or even from human nature it&s;elf; all the&s;e are imputed to that &s;candalous, that wicked, that u&s;urped con|&s;titution under which we, the &s;ubjects of this country, have hitherto mi&s;takenly conceived that we lived happy and free.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I apprehend it to be no very difficult operation of the human mind to di&s;|tingui&s;h rea&s;oning and well meant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion from a deliberate de&s;ign to calumniate the law and con&s;titution under which we live, and to withdraw men's allegiance from that con|&s;titution; it is the operation of good &s;en&s;e: it is therefore no difficult operation for a jury of the City of London, therefore: you will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve whether the whole of this book, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, &s;uch part as I am at pre&s;ent at liberty to advert to, is not of this de&s;cription, that it is by no means calculated to di&s;cu&s;s and to convince, but to perform the &s;horter proce&s;s of inflammation;
<PB N="53" REF="52">not to rea&s;on upon any &s;ubject, but to dictate; and gentleman, as I &s;tated to you before, to dictate in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch phra&s;e, and with all &s;uch circum&s;tances as cannot, in my humble apprehen&s;ion, leave the mo&s;t re|mote doubt upon your minds of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the heart of that man who compo&s;ed that book.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you will permit me now to &s;ay a word or two upon tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which I have &s;elected to you, fir&s;t de&s;cribing a little what tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are. I have thought it much more becoming, much more beneficial to the public, than any other cour&s;e that I could take, to &s;elect &s;ix or &s;even, and no more, (not wi&s;hing to load the record unnece&s;&s;arily) of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that go to the very root of our con&s;titution, that is the nature of the pa&s;&s;ages which I have &s;elected, and gentlemen, the fir&s;t of them is in page 21, where you will find this doctrine.</P>
<P><Q>All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny, an heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;igni|ficant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a govern|ment is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, what is the tendency of this pa&s;&s;age? "All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny." So that no quali|fication whatever, not even the &s;ubordination to the law of the country, which is the only paramount thing that we know of in this
<PB N="54" REF="53">country, can take it out of the de&s;cription of tyranny; the regal office being neither more nor le&s;s than a tru&s;t executed for the &s;ubjects of this country; the per&s;on who fills the re|gal office being under&s;tood, in this country, to be neither more nor le&s;s than the chief exe|cutive magi&s;trate heading the whole gradation of magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>But without any qualification he &s;tates it roundly, that under all circum&s;tances whatever hereditary government mu&s;t in its nature be tyranny; what is that but to hold out to the people of this country that they are nought but &s;laves; to be &s;ure, if they are living under a tyranny, it is impo&s;&s;ible to draw any other con&s;equence.</P>
<P>This is one of tho&s;e &s;hort propo&s;itions that are crammed down the throat of every man that is acce&s;&s;ible to their arts in this country; this is one of tho&s;e propo&s;itions, which, if he believes, mu&s;t have the due effect upon his mind, of &s;aying, the ca&s;e is come when I un|der&s;tand&punc; I am opre&s;&s;ed, I can bear it no longer.</P>
<P>"An heritable crown." Ours is an heri|table crown, and therefore it is comprehended in this dogma: "Or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called." Is that di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? Contemptuous, vilifying, and de|grading expre&s;&s;ions of that &s;ort are applied to that which we are accu&s;tomed to look to with reverence, namely, the repre&s;entation of the whole body of magi&s;tracy and of the law&mdash; <Q>have no other &s;ignificant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To in|herit
<PB N="55" REF="54">a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>Why, gentlemen, are the people of Eng|land to be told, without further ceremony, that they are inherited by a King of this coun|try, and that they are preci&s;ely in the ca&s;e of &s;heep and oxen? I leave you to judge if &s;uch gro&s;s, contemptible, and abominable fal&s;ehood is delivered out in bits and &s;craps of this &s;ort, whether that does not call aloud for pu|ni&s;hment?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, only look at the truth; the con|ver&s;e is directly the ca&s;e. The King of this country inherits an office under the law; he does not inherit per&s;ons; we are not in a &s;tate of villenage; the direct rever&s;e to what is here pointed out is the truth of the matter; the King inherits an office, but as to any in|heritance of his people, none, you know, be|longs to him, and I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay any thing more upon it.</P>
<P>The next is in page 47. in which this man is &s;peaking of the Congre&s;s at Philadelphia in 1787, which was held becau&s;e the government of that country was found to be extremely de|fective as at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><Q>This Convention met at Philadelphia, in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected pre&s;ident; he was not at that time con|nected with any of the State-governments or with Congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;|&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Convention went deeply into all the &s;ubjects, and having, after a variety of de|bate
<PB N="56" REF="55">and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them|&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal Con|&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was the manner of giving it authority and practice.</Q></P>
<P>What is the conclu&s;ion of that&mdash;they cer|tainly agreed upon an appointment of their federal Con&s;titution in 1787. I &s;hould have thought that a man, meaning nothing more than hi&s;tory, would have been very well con|tented to have &s;tated what actually did hap|pen upon that occa&s;ion; but, in order to di&s;|cu&s;s (as po&s;&s;ibly it may be called) &s;omething that formerly did pa&s;s in this country, he cho&s;e to do it in the&s;e inflaming and con|temptuous terms.</P>
<P><Q>For this purpo&s;e they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder or a German Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q></P>
<P>Here again the revolution and the act of &s;ettlement &s;tare us in the face, as if the intere&s;t and the &s;en&s;e of the country were in no way con&s;ulted; but, on the contrary, it was no|thing more than a mere cabal of courtiers.&mdash; Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her that is or is not to be endured in this country, your verdict will &s;hew; but, in order to &s;hew you how totally unnece&s;&s;ary this pa&s;&s;age was, except for the deliberate purpo&s;e of calumny; if this pa&s;&s;age had been left out, the narration would have been quite perfect. I will read three or four lines ju&s;t to &s;hew how perfect it would have been:&mdash; <Q>The next que&s;tion was about the manner of giving it authority and practice.</Q> The pa&s;&s;age be|yond
<PB N="57" REF="56">that which I call a libel,&mdash;<Q>They fir&s;t directed that the propo&s;ed Con&s;titution &s;hould be publi&s;hed; &s;econdly, that each State &s;hould elect a Convention, for the pur|po&s;e of taking it into con&s;ideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it;</Q> and &s;o the &s;tory goes on&mdash;but, in order to explain what I mean by a dogma thru&s;t in, I call your attention to this, as one of tho&s;e which has no earth|ly connexion with the &s;ubject he was then &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>Does not this pa&s;&s;age &s;tand in&s;ulated be|tween the two parts of the connected &s;tory officiou&s;ly and de&s;ignedly thru&s;t in for the purpo&s;es of mi&s;chief? Gentlemen, the artifice of that book con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o in this; the different wicked pa&s;&s;ages that are meant to do mi&s;chief in this country, are &s;pread throughout it, and &s;tuck in here and there, in a manner that in order to &s;ee the whole malignity of it, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to have a recollection of &s;everal pre|ceding pa&s;&s;ages; but the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages when brought together manife&s;tly &s;hew the full de|&s;ign of the writer, and therefore extracts of it may be made to contain the whole marrow; and at the &s;ame time that each pa&s;&s;age, taken by it&s;elf, will do mi&s;chief enough, any man reading them together, will &s;ee that mi&s;chief come out much clearer than by a mere tran&s;ient reading.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age I have to ob&s;erve upon is in page 52, and in page 52 he is plea&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf in this manner: he &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>The hi&s;tory of the Edwards and the Henrys, and up to the commencement of
<PB N="58" REF="57">the Stuarts, exhibits as many in&s;tances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had re&s;tricted it; the Stuarts endeavoured to pa&s;s tho&s;e limits, and their fate is well known. In all the&s;e in|&s;tances we &s;ee nothing of a Con&s;titution, but only of re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power.</Q></P>
<P>Then, gentlemen, from the reign of the Edwards and the Henrys down to the Revo|lution, it was a regular progre&s;&s;ion of tyranny, not a progre&s;&s;ion of liberty but of tyranny, till the Stuarts &s;tepped a little beyond the line in the gradation that was going for|wards, and that begot a nece&s;&s;ity for a revo|lution; but of the Edwards I &s;hould have thought, at lea&s;t, he might have &s;pared the great founder of our juri&s;prudence, King Edward the Fir&s;t, be&s;ide many other Princes, the glory and the boa&s;t of this country, and many of them regarders of its freedom and Con&s;ti|tution; but in&s;tead of that, this author would have the people of this country believe that up to that time it was a progre&s;&s;ive tyranny, and that there was nothing of a Con&s;titution, only re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power;&mdash;&s;o that all the power that exi&s;ted at that time was a&s;&s;umption and u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>He thus proceeds <Q>After this another Wil|liam de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and claiming from the &s;ame origin, gained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of the two evils, James and William, the nation preferred what it thought the lea&s;t</Q> So that the deliverance of this country by the Prince of Orange was an evil, but the lea&s;t of the two, <Q>since from circum&s;tances it mu&s;t take one. The act
<PB N="59" REF="58">called the Bill of Rights comes here into view: What is it but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privi|leges? You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I will have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the na|tion, it &s;aid, for <HI>your &s;hare,</HI> YOU <HI>&s;hall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, the Bill of Rights is more properly a BILL OF WRONGS AND OF INSULT. As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it was a thing that made it&s;elf, and then made the authority by which it acted; a few per&s;ons got together, and called them&s;elves by that name; &s;everal of them had never been elect|ed, and none of them for the purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the time of William a &s;pecies of government aro&s;e, i&s;&s;uing out of this coali|tion Bill of Rights, and more &s;o &s;ince the corruption introduced at the Hanover &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion by the agency of Walpole, that can be de&s;cribed by no other name than a de|&s;potic legi&s;lation.</Q></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, this is the de&s;cription that this man holds out of that on which re&s;ts the property, the lives, and liberties, and the pri|vileges of the people of this country. I won|der to God, gentlemen, that any Briti&s;h man (for &s;uch this man certainly was, and &s;till is) to u&s;e the words of our own Poet, when he &s;poke the&s;e words, A BILL OF WRONGS, A BILL OF INSULT, they did not "&s;tick in his throat." What is that Bill of Rights? It can never be too often read. I will make no comment upon it, becau&s;e your own heads and hearts will
<PB N="60" REF="59">make that comment; you have a po&s;terity to look to. Are de&s;perate ruffians, who are to be found in every country, thus to attack the unalienable rights and privileges which are to de&s;cend undimini&s;hed to that po&s;terity?</P>
<P>Are YOU not to take care that this &s;hall be &s;acred to your po&s;terity. Is it not a tru&s;t in YOUR hands? It is a tru&s;t in YOUR hands as much as the execution of the law is a tru&s;t in the hands of the crown; each has its guar|dians in this community, but you are the guardians of the Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is this, <Q>That the pretended power of &s;u&s;pending of laws, or the execu|tion of laws, by regal authority, without con|&s;ent of parliament, is illegal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That the pretended power of di&s;pen&s;ing with laws, or the execution of laws, by the regal authority, as it hath been a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed of late, is illegal.</Q></P>
<P>That is the law is above all.</P>
<P><Q>That levying money for, or to the u&s;e of, the Crown, by pretence of prerogative, without grant of parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the &s;ame is or &s;hall be granted, is illegal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That it is the right of the &s;ubjects to pe|tition the king, and all commitments and pro&s;ecutions for &s;uch petitions are illegal.</Q></P>
<P>All that you get by the Bill of Rights, ac|cording to this man's doctrine, is, that the Commons of this country have the right of petitioning. We all know this alludes to the ca&s;e of the &s;even bi&s;hops; that was a gro&s;s violation of the rights of tho&s;e &s;ubjects of this
<PB N="61" REF="60">country; therefore, he &s;tates, fal&s;ely and ma|liciou&s;ly, according to the language of the in|formation, which is perfectly correct in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, that the whole that was obtained by the &s;ubjects of this country was the right of petitioning; whereas it is declared to be their unalterable right, and ever to have been &s;o, and adverts, as I before &s;tated, to a gro&s;s violation of it in a recent ca&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>That the rai&s;ing or keeping a &s;tanding army within the kingdom in time of peace, unle&s;s it be with con&s;ent of parliament, is again&s;t law.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That the &s;ubjects, which are prote&s;tants, may have arms for their defence, &s;uitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That elections of members of parliament ought to be free.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That the freedom of &s;peech, and debates or proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached, or que&s;tioned, in any court or place out of parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be re|quired, nor exce&s;&s;ive fines impo&s;ed, nor cruel and unu&s;ual puni&s;hments inflicted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That jurors ought to be duly impannelled and returned; and jurors which pa&s;s upon men in trials for high trea&s;on ought to be freeholders.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That all grants and promi&s;es of fines and forfeitures of particular per&s;ons, before conviction, are illegal and void.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And that for the redre&s;s of all griev|ances, and for the amendig, &s;trengthening,
<PB N="62" REF="61">and pre&s;erving of the laws, parliaments ought to be held frequently.</Q></P>
<P>Further, gentlemen, this bill goes on to &s;ay, <Q>For the ratifying, confirming, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the &s;aid declaration, and the articles, clau&s;es, matters, and things, therein con|tained, by the force of a law made in due form, by authority of Parliament, do pray it may be declared and enacted, that all and &s;ingular the rights and liberties a&s;&s;erted and claimed in the &s;aid declaration are the true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom, and &s;o &s;hall be e&s;teemed, allowed, adjudged, deemed, and taken to be; and that all and every the particulars afore&s;aid &s;hall be firmly and &s;trictly holden and ob&s;erved, as they are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid declaration, and all officers and mini&s;ters what&s;oever &s;hall &s;erve their maje&s;ties and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, according to the &s;ame in all times to come.</Q></P>
<P>Such, gentlemen, is the Bill of Wrongs and of In&s;ult. I &s;hall not profane it by &s;aying one more word upon it.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, I would a&s;k you, whether what is &s;aid by this man be rea&s;oning or di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion; or whether it is nothing el&s;e but de|ception, and that deception con&s;i&s;ting of a mo&s;t abominable and complete &s;uppre&s;&s;ion? Is there a word of this act quoted? Has the poor mechanic, to whom this pa&s;&s;age is ad|dre&s;&s;ed, who is told that he has been wronged and in&s;ulted at the revolution, has he this &s;tatute by him to read? Would it not have been fair, at lea&s;t, to have &s;tated what it was? But in&s;tead of that, un&s;ight, un&s;een, (to u&s;e
<PB N="63" REF="62">a very vulgar expre&s;&s;ion) this propo&s;ition is tendered to the very lowe&s;t man in this country, namely, that the Bill of Rights is a Bill of Wrongs and of In&s;ult.</P>
<P>Pa&s;s we then on to another; if you will plea&s;e to make a memorandum of page 56, you will find that in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and with the &s;ame de&s;ign, this man tells you that&mdash;"The intention of the government of Eng|land," here comes in another contemptuous expre&s;&s;ion (<Q>for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name than the Engli&s;h government), appears &s;ince its political connexion with Germany to have been &s;o completely en|gro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>The government of the country then does not exi&s;t for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving our lives and properties; but the government, I mean the Con&s;titution of the country, Kings, Lords, and Commons, exi&s;ts for no other pur|po&s;e but to be the in&s;truments of rai&s;ing taxes. To enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that, is taking up your time unnece&s;&s;arily&mdash;I only beg to draw your attention to the dogmatical and cavalier manner in which the&s;e things are a&s;&s;erted; fur|ther, he &s;ays&mdash; <Q>Dome&s;tic concerns are ne|glected, and with re&s;pect to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tand in the city of London; I am ad|dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to gentlemen eminent in that city, whether the legi&s;lature, &s;ince the revolu|tion, has, or not, adverted to dome&s;tic concerns: I think I may appeal to the growing pro&s;|perity
<PB N="64" REF="63">of this country, from the moment that the night mare has been taken off its &s;tomach, which pre&s;&s;ed upon it up to that moment.</P>
<P>We then proceed to page 63, where, after the whole Con&s;titution of this country has been thus treated in gro&s;s, he proceeds a little to di&s;&s;ect and con&s;ider the component parts of that Con&s;titution; and in page 63, in a dogma, we have this:</P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to the two Hou&s;es of which the Engli&s;h Parliament is com|po&s;ed, they appear to be effectually in|fluenced into one, and, as a legi&s;lature, to have no temper of its own. The Mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it, as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obe|dience.</Q></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, here is another dogma without a &s;ingle fact, without a &s;ingle argu|ment; but it is held out to the &s;ubjects of this country, that there is no energy or activity in either the ari&s;tocratical or democratical parts of this Con&s;titution, but that they are a&s;leep, and you might ju&s;t as well have &s;tatues there; it is not merely &s;aid that it is &s;o now, but it is in the nature of things, &s;ays he, that it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P><Q>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two Hou&s;es, the difference will appear &s;o great as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it.&mdash;Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;o
<PB N="65" REF="64">little is this nickname, Hou&s;e regarded, that the people &s;carcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, this is again &s;peaking in this man's contemptuous manner, at the expence of the ari&s;tocratical part of our con|&s;titution of government; an e&s;&s;entially bene|ficial part, who&s;e great and permanent inte|re&s;t in the country renders them a firm barrier again&s;t any encroachment. I am not to &s;up|po&s;e that you are &s;o ignorant of the hi&s;tory of your country, as not to know the great and brilliant characters that have &s;at in that Hou&s;e. No particular period of time is alluded to in this pa&s;&s;age. He &s;urely cannot mean the pre|&s;ent time; but I conceive he &s;peaks of all times, and that from the very nature of our government it mu&s;t everla&s;tingly be &s;o. Slan|der upon that very great and illu&s;trious part of the legi&s;lature (untrue at any period), writ|ten in this &s;currilous and contemptuous manner, is di&s;tingui&s;hed greatly indeed from any &s;ober di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of, whether an ari&s;tocratical part of government is a good or bad thing, and is calculated only to mi&s;lead and inflame.</P>
<P>If you look next to page 107, there you will find that two of the component parts of the legi&s;lature having been thus di&s;po&s;ed of, we come up to the throne it&s;elf, and this man &s;ays very truly of him&s;elf:</P>
<P><Q>Having thus GLANCED at &s;ome of the de|fects of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, I
<PB N="66" REF="65">proceed to <HI>what is called the Crown,</HI> upon which I &s;hall be very conci&s;e:</Q></P>
<P><Q>It &s;ignifies a nominal office of a million a year, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ts in re|ceiving the money; whether the per&s;on be wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;ane or in&s;ane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every mini&s;ter acts upon the &s;ame idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people mu&s;t be hoodwink|ed, and held in super&s;titious ignorance by &s;ome bugbear or other; and what is called the Crown an&s;wers this purpo&s;e, and there|fore it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es to be ex|pected from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;This is more than can be &s;aid of the other two branches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The hazard to which this office is expo&s;ed in all countries, including this among the re&s;t, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation, the danger of its coming to its &s;en&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>Then, gentlemen, we have been in&s;ane for the&s;e &s;even or eight hundred years: and I &s;hall ju&s;t di&s;mi&s;s this with this ob&s;ervation, that this in&s;anity having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long, I tru&s;t in God that it is incurable.</P>
<P>In page 116 you have this note,&mdash; <Q>I hap|pened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have al|ways appeared to me dete&s;table; the one &s;eeking to de&s;troy his uncle, and the other her father, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power them|&s;elves: yet as the nation was di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;omething of that event, I felt hurt
<PB N="67" REF="66">at &s;eeing it a&s;cribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job, and who, be&s;ides what he otherwi&s;e got, charged &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the expence of a little fleet that brought him from Holland.&mdash;George the Fir&s;t acted the &s;ame clo&s;e-fi&s;ted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremen with the money he got from England, two hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds over and above his pay as King; and having thus purcha&s;ed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit.&mdash;In fact, every nation that does not govern it&s;elf, is governed as a job. England has been the prey of jobs ever &s;ince the Re|volution.</Q></P>
<P>Then, gentlemen, what he calls a nation governing it&s;elf, is &s;omething extremely diffe|rent from a nation having con&s;ented from time immemorial to be governed by a democracy, an ari&s;tocracy, and an hereditary executive &s;u|preme magi&s;trate; and moreover, by a law-paramount, which all are bound to obey, he conceives, I &s;ay, that &s;ort of government not to be a government of the people them&s;elves, but he denominates that &s;ort of government a job, and not a government.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;uch are the pa&s;&s;ages which I have &s;elected to you, as tho&s;e that di&s;clo&s;e the mo&s;t offen&s;ive doctrines in the book; that is, &s;uch as go fundamentally to the overturning the government of this country.&mdash;I beg pardon, I have omitted one which contains more of di|rect invitation than any thing I have yet &s;tated,
<PB N="68" REF="67">&mdash;it is in page 161: it is &s;aid, <Q>the fraud, hy|pocri&s;y and impo&s;ition of governments are now beginning to be too well under&s;tood to promi&s;e them any long career.&mdash;The farce of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dre&s;&s;ing for the funeral&mdash;let it then pa&s;s quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourner be comforted. The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for &s;ending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brun&s;wick, for men, at the expence of a million a year, who under&s;tand neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t, and who&s;e capacities would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of pari&s;h con&s;table.</Q></P>
<P>This is &s;aid of William the Third&mdash;this is &s;aid of two very illu&s;trious Princes of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, George the Fir&s;t and Second, and extends to the pre&s;ent Sovereign upon the throne.</P>
<P><Q>If government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpo&s;es may be found in every town and village in England.</Q></P>
<P>The policy of the con&s;titution of this coun|try has ever avoided, excepting when driven to it by melancholy nece&s;&s;ity, to di&s;turb the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and it has wi&s;ely thought it more fitting to pur&s;ue that &s;y&s;tem, even though a foreigner &s;hould be &s;eated on the thronce of the&s;e realms, than to break through it.&mdash;This would in&s;inuate, that the nece&s;&s;ary defects of an hereditary monarchy
<PB N="69" REF="68">are &s;uch as outweigh the advantages attend|ing that which I have &s;tated. Is that &s;o? I would a&s;k any man who hears me, in point of hi&s;tory, whether it is not the permanent defect of elec|tive monarchies or &s;overeigns, that they &s;el|dom are men of any con&s;ideration, and for an obvious rea&s;on; mo&s;t frequently it has hap|pened that turbulent factions, after having de&s;olated their country, one of them (it has &s;o happened, at lea&s;t in mo&s;t in&s;tances as far as my recollection goes) &s;ets up a tool whom the &s;ucce&s;sful faction can them&s;elves govern at plea&s;ure.&mdash;Often has it happened that &s;uch factions, when a civil war ari&s;es, which mu&s;t almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the ca&s;e in elective mo|narchies, not choo&s;ing to come to the conclu|&s;ion of an armed conte&s;t, have cho&s;en a very weak per&s;on, each in hope of &s;trengthening his party by the time the periodical civil war &s;hould come round. I believe, upon examin|ation, this will be found to be generally the ca&s;e, and to have prevailed in elective monar|chies to a greater degree than any inconve|niences that may have ever ari&s;en from the na|tural infirmities of princes who &s;ucceeded to their thrones by hereditary rights, in the con|&s;titution of Great Britain; for to that, this man alludes.</P>
<P>Has he &s;tated with any &s;ort of fairne&s;s, or has he at all &s;tated or adverted to the many, many remedies we have for any defect of that &s;ort? Has he &s;tated the numerous councils of a King? His council of Parliament &mdash;his council of his Judges in matters of law&mdash; his Privy council? Has he &s;tated the re&s;pon&s;i|bility of all tho&s;e councils? Some in point of
<PB N="70" REF="69">character, &s;ome of per&s;onable re&s;pon&s;ibility? Has he &s;tated the re&s;pon&s;ibility of tho&s;e imme|diate &s;ervants who conduct his executive go|vernment? Has he &s;tated the appointment of regents? Has he &s;tated all this, which is in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary towards a fair and hone&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ion (which this book will po&s;&s;ibly be called) of this point of his in&s;uperable ob|jection to hereditary monarchy? Can this be called any other than gro&s;s &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and wilful mis-&s;tatement, to rai&s;e di&s;content in half-informed minds?</P>
<P>There does come acro&s;s my mind at this mo|ment, unque&s;tionably, one illu&s;trious excep|tion to that doctrine I have &s;tated, of men not the mo&s;t capable of government having in ge|neral been cho&s;en in the ca&s;e of elective mo|narchies; and that is a man whom no indig|nities, no misfortunes, no disappointments, no civil commotions, no provocations, ever forced from the full and &s;teady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong mind, which has always ri&s;en with ela&s;ticity under all the pre&s;&s;ures that I have &s;tated; and he, though not in one &s;en&s;e of that word a great <HI>Prince,</HI> yet is certainly a great <HI>Man,</HI> who will go down as &s;uch to the late&s;t po&s;terity: I mean the King of Poland. Don't imagine, gentlemen, that my adverting to this illu&s;|trious character is u&s;ele&s;s. Every gentleman who hears knows he had a con&s;iderable part of his matured education in this country. Here he familiarized him&s;elf with the con&s;ti|tution of this country. Here he became in|formed of the provi&s;ions of what this man calls the Bill of Wrongs and In&s;ults, without di&s;|paragement
<PB N="71" REF="70">to him, for I believe him to be a ju&s;t and wi&s;e prince, of great natural facul|ties, here it was that he &s;aw, and could alone learn how the regal government of a free peo|ple was conducted, and that under a prince of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, having &s;tated thus much to you, I will now, for want of &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions, (for mine are very feeble) borrow from ano|ther; I certainly have formed an opinion upon this &s;ubject preci&s;ely &s;imilar; to deli|ver it in plain words would exhau&s;t the ut|mo&s;t of my powers, but I will borrow the words of a very able writer, who has mo&s;t properly, for fear &s;ome ill impre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be made by this book on the weaker part of mankind in America, given an an&s;wer to this book of Mr. Paine. That di&s;tingui&s;hed gen|tleman, I have rea&s;on to believe, though not the chief magi&s;trate in that country, is the &s;econd in the executive government of it; that is, he is &s;econd in the exerci&s;e of the re|gal part of the government of that country. He takes care to confute accurately what Mr. Paine &s;ays with re&s;pect to America; but, borrowing his <HI>words,</HI> I beg to be under&s;tood, that this is my <HI>opinion</HI> of the work before you, and which I humbly offer for your con&s;idera|tion and adoption. He &s;ays, <Q>his intention appears evidently to be, to convince the people of Great Britain, that they have nei|ther liberty nor a con&s;titution; that their only po&s;&s;ible means to produce tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings to them&s;elves, is to topple down head|long
<PB N="72" REF="71">their pre&s;ent government, and follow implicitly the example of the French.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the next pa&s;&s;age, which I beg to be under&s;tood as mine, I wi&s;h I could ex|pre&s;s it as well my&s;elf, is this:&mdash; <Q>Mr. Paine, in reply, cuts the Gordian knot at once, declares the parliament of 1688 to have been downright u&s;urpers, cen&s;ures them for having unwi&s;ely &s;ent to Holland for a King, denies the exi&s;tence of a Briti&s;h Con|&s;titution, and invites the people of England to overturn their pre&s;ent government and to erect another upon the broad ba&s;is of na|tional &s;overeignty and government by re|pre&s;entation. As Mr. Paine has departed al|together from the principles of the revolu|tion, and has torn up by the roots all rea&s;on|ing from the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, by the de|nial of its exi&s;tence, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to examine his work upon the grounds which he has cho&s;en to a&s;&s;ume. If we judge of the production from its apparent tendency, we may call it an addre&s;s to the Engli&s;h nation, attempting to prove that they have a right to form a new Con&s;titution; that it is expedient for them immediately to exerci&s;e that right, and that in the formation of this Con&s;titution they can do no better than to imitate the model &s;et before them by the French na|tional a&s;&s;embly. However immethodical his production is, I believe the whole of its ar|gumentative part may be referred to the&s;e three points: If the &s;ubject were to affect only the Briti&s;h nation, we might leave them to rea&s;on and act for them&s;elves; but
<PB N="73" REF="72">the&s;e are concerns equally important to all mankind; and the citizens of America are called upon, from high authority, (he al|ludes to a gentleman in a high &s;ituation in that country, who has publi&s;hed an opinion of this book) to rally round the &s;tandard of this champion of revolutions. I &s;hall, therefore now proceed to examine the rea|&s;ons;</Q> and &s;o he goes on.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I would adopt, with your per|mi&s;&s;ion, a few more words from this publica|tion:&mdash; <Q>When Mr. Paine invited the people of England to de&s;troy their pre&s;ent govern|ment, and form another con&s;titution, he &s;hould have given them &s;ober rea&s;oning, and not flippant wittici&s;ms.</Q> Whether that is or not the ca&s;e what I have read to you to-day will enable you to judge. <Q>He &s;hould have explained to them the nature of the grievances by which they are oppre&s;&s;ed, and demon&s;trated the impo&s;&s;ibility of reforming the government in its pre&s;ent organization. He &s;hould have pointed out &s;ome po&s;&s;ible method for them to act, in their original character, without a total di&s;&s;olution of civil &s;ociety among them; he &s;hould have proved what great advantages they would reap as a nation from &s;uch a revolution, without di&s;gui&s;ing the great dangers and formidable difficulties with which it mu&s;t be attended.</Q> So much for the pa&s;&s;ages them|&s;elves, and this interpretation, which I hum|bly &s;ubmit to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The next matter upon which I &s;hall proceed is the evidence which I propo&s;e to adduce, and
<PB N="74" REF="73">that evidence will go to &s;hew, not only the fact of this man's being the writer of this book, by his own repeated admi&s;&s;ion, and by letters under his own hand, but will likewi&s;e go di|rectly to &s;hew what is his intent in &s;uch publi|cation, which appears I think mo&s;t clearly; and over and above that I &s;hall produce to you a Letter, which this man was plea&s;ed to ad|dre&s;s to my&s;elf, in which Letter he avows him&s;elf in &s;o many words the author, and I &s;hall prove it to be his hand-writing; and further than that, there is matter in that let|ter, apparently &s;hewing the intention with which that book was written, namely to vil|lify this con&s;titution, and to injure this coun|try irretrievably.</P>
<P>Two other letters I &s;hall be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of reading to you, in which he has &s;tated him&s;elf the author. The one is a let|ter to a per&s;on of the name of Jordan, in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this manner:</P>

<P>My Lord, the Attorney General &s;tates a letter in the hand writing of Mr. Paine, which e&s;tabli&s;hes that he is the author. I de&s;ire to know whether he means to read a letter which may be the &s;ubject of a &s;ub&s;tantive and di&s;tinct pro&s;ecution; I do not mean to di&s;pute the publication, or even to give him the trouble of proving the letters which he has ju&s;t &s;tated; whether the Attorney General will think it con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;itua|tion in which he is placed, at this moment, to read a letter written at a time long &s;ub&s;equent to the publication, containing, as I under&s;tand (if I am mi&s;taken in that I withdraw my ob|jection) but containing di&s;tinct clear and un|equivocal libellous matter, and which I, in my addre&s;s to the jury, if I am not deceived in what I have heard, &s;hall admit to be upon every principle of the Engli&s;h Law a libel. There|fore, if that &s;hould turn out to be the ca&s;e, will your lord&s;hip &s;uffer the mind of the jury to be entirely put a&s;ide from that matter which is the &s;ubject of the pro&s;ecution, and to go into matter which hereafter may be, and I can|not but &s;uppo&s;e would be, if the defendant
<PB N="76" REF="75">were within the reach of the law of this country, the &s;ubject of a di&s;tinct and inde|pendant pro&s;ecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD KENYON.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that letter goes a jot to prove that he is the author of this publi|cation, I cannot reject that evidence; in pro&s;ecutions for high trea&s;on, where overt acts are laid, you may prove overt acts not laid to prove tho&s;e that are laid; if it goes to prove him the author of the book, I am bound to admit it.</P>
<P>"Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL,</P>
<P>The Letter is thus:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Paris,</HI> 11th <HI>of November,</HI> 1&s;t <HI>Year of the Republic.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, as there can be no per&s;onal re&s;ent|ment between two &s;trangers, I write this letter to you, as to a man again&s;t whom I have no animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>You have, as Attorney General, com|menced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t me as the author of the Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in con&s;equence of my being elected a member of the National Convention of France, called me from England, I &s;hould have &s;taid to have conte&s;ted the inju&s;tice of that pro&s;ecution; not upon my own account, for I cared not about the pro&s;ecution, but to defend the principles I had advanced in the work.</P>
<P>The duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble my&s;elf about your pro&s;ecution; when I have
<PB N="77" REF="76">lei&s;ure, I &s;hall have no objection to meet you on that ground; but, as I now &s;tand, whe|ther you go on with the pro&s;ecution or whether you do not, or whether you obtain a verdict, or not, is a matter of the mo&s;t perfect indifference to me as an individual. If you obtain one (which you are welcome to if you can get it), it cannot affect me, either in per&s;on, property, or reputation, otherwi&s;e than to increa&s;e the latter; and with re|&s;pect to your&s;elf, it is as con&s;i&s;tent that you obtain a verdict again&s;t the Man in the Moon, as again&s;t me; neither do I &s;ee how you can continue the pro&s;ecution again&s;t me as you would have done again&s;t one of <HI>your own people,</HI> who had ab&s;ented him&s;elf becau&s;e he was pro&s;ecuted; what pa&s;&s;ed at Dover, proves that my departure from England was no &s;ecret.</P>
<P>My nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence from your country affords the opportunity of knowing whe|ther the pro&s;ecution was intended again&s;t Thomas Paine, or again&s;t the Rights of the People of England to inve&s;tigate &s;y&s;tems and principles of government; for as I cannot now be the object of the pro&s;ecution, the going on with the pro&s;ecution will &s;hew that &s;omething el&s;e was the object, and that &s;omething el&s;e can be no other than the People of England; for it is again&s;t <HI>their Rights,</HI> and not again&s;t me, that a verdict or &s;entence can operate, if it can operate at all. Be then &s;o candid as to tell the Jury (if you chu&s;e to continue the proce&s;s) whom it is
<PB N="78" REF="77">you are pro&s;ecuting, and on whom it is that the verdict is to fall.</P></Q>
<P>Gentlemen, I certainly will comply with this reque&s;t. I am pro&s;ecuting both him and his work; and if I &s;ucceed in this pro&s;ecution, he &s;hall never return to this country otherwi&s;e than <HI>in vinculis,</HI> for I will outlaw him.</P>
<Q>But I have other rea&s;ons than tho&s;e I have mentioned for writing you this letter; and however you may chu&s;e to interpret them, they procceed from a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too &s;erious to play with Court pro&s;ecutions, and &s;port with national rights. The terrible examples that have taken place here upon men who, le&s;s than a year ago, thought them&s;elves as &s;ecure as any pro&s;ecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney General, can now do in England, ought to have &s;ome weight with men in your &s;ituation.</Q>
<P>Now gentlemen, I do not think that Mr. Paine judges very well of mankind&mdash;I do not think that it is a fair conclu&s;ion of Mr. Paine, that men &s;uch as you and my&s;elf, who are quietly living in obedience to the laws of the land which they inhabit, exerci&s;ing their &s;e|veral functions peaceably, and I hope with a moderate &s;hare of reputation: I do not con|ceive that men called upon to think, and in the habit of reflection, are the mo&s;t likely men to be immediately thrown off the hinges by meances and threats; and I doubt whether men exerci&s;ing public functions, as you and I do in the face of our country, could have the courage to run away. All I can tell Mr. Paine
<PB N="79" REF="78">is this&mdash;if any of his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins are here in Lon|don, and there is &s;ome ground to &s;uppo&s;e they may be, or the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of tho&s;e with whom he is connected; if they are here, I tell them, that I do in my con&s;cience think, that for a man to die of doing his duty, is ju&s;t as good a thing as dying of a raging fever, or under the tortures of the &s;tone. Let him not think, that not to be an incendiary is to be a coward.</P>
<P>He &s;ays&mdash; <Q>That the Government of Eng|land is as great, if not the greate&s;t perfection of fraud and corruption, that ever took place &s;ince governments began, is what you cannot be a &s;tranger to; unle&s;s the con&s;tant habit of &s;eeing it has blinded your &s;en&s;e." Upon my word gentlemen, I am &s;tone blind, I am not &s;orry for it.</Q>&mdash; <Q>But though you may not chu&s;e to &s;ee it, the people are &s;eeing it very fa&s;t, and the progre&s;s is beyond what you may chu&s;e to believe, or that rea&s;on can make any other man believe, that the capa|city of &s;uch a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate &s;ons, is nece&s;&s;ary to the government of a nation.</Q></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, with re&s;pect to this pa&s;&s;age, I have this to &s;ay, it is contemptuous, &s;can|dalous, fal&s;e, cruel;&mdash;Why Gentlemen, is Mr. Paine, in addition to the political doctrines that he is teaching us in this country; Is he to teach us the morality and religion, of IM|PLACABILITY? Is he to teach human creatures, who&s;e moments of exi&s;tence, depend upon the permi&s;&s;ion of a Being, merciful, long &s;uffering and of great goodne&s;s, that tho&s;e youthful errors from which even royalty is not ex|empted,
<PB N="80" REF="79">are to be trea&s;ured up in a vindictive memory, and are to receive &s;entence of irre|mi&s;&s;ible &s;in at HIS hands. Are they all to be confounded in the&s;e &s;landerous terms, &s;hock|ing for Briti&s;h ears to hear, and I am &s;ure di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to their hearts. He is a barbarian, who could u&s;e &s;uch profligate expre&s;&s;ions un|called for by any thing which could be the object of his letter addre&s;&s;ed to me. If giving me pain was his object, he has that helli&s;h gratification. Would this man de&s;troy that great auxiliary of all human laws and con|&s;titutions&mdash; "to judge of others as we would be judged our&s;elves."&mdash;This is the bill of wrongs and in&s;ults of the chri&s;tian religion. I pre&s;ume it is con&s;idered as that bill of wrongs and in&s;ults, in the heart of that man who can have the barbarity to u&s;e tho&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions and addre&s;s them to me in a way by which I could not but receive them.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there is not perhaps in the world a more beneficial analogy, nor a finer rule to judge by in public matters, than by a&s;&s;imi|lating them to what pa&s;&s;es in dome&s;tic life.&mdash; A family is a &s;mall kingdom, a kingdom is a large family &s;uppo&s;e this to have happened in private life, judge of the good heart of this man, who thru&s;ts into my hands, the grateful &s;ervant of a kind and beneficent ma&s;ter, and that too through the unavoidable trick of the common po&s;t &s;lander upon that ma&s;ter, and &s;lander upon his whole offspring. Lay your hands upon your hearts, and tell me what is <HI>your</HI> verdict with re&s;pect to his heart&mdash;I <HI>&s;ee</HI> it!
<PB N="81" REF="80">Gentlemen, he has the audacity to &s;ay, "I &s;peak to you as one man ought to &s;peak to an|other." Does he &s;peak to me of tho&s;e Augu&s;t Per&s;onages as one man ought to &s;peak to an|other? Had he &s;poken tho&s;e words to me per|&s;onally, I will not an&s;wer for it, whether I &s;hould not have forgot the duties of my office, and the dignity of my &s;tation, by being hurried into a violation of that peace, the breach of which I am compelled to puni&s;h in others. He &s;ays, <Q>And I know al&s;o, that I &s;peak, what other people are beginning to think. That you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do, it will &s;ignify nothing) without <HI>packing a Jury,</HI> and we <HI>both</HI> know that &s;uch tricks are practi&s;ed, is what I have very good rea|&s;on to believe.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Mentiris impudenti&s;&s;ime.</HI> &mdash;Gentlemen, I know of no &s;uch practice; I know, indeed, that no &s;uch practice exi&s;ts, nor can exi&s;t; I know the very contrary of this to be true; and I know too that this Letter, containing this dangerous fal&s;ehood, was de|&s;tined for future publication; that I have no doubt of, and therefore I dwell thus long upon it.</P>
<P><Q>I have gone into coffee-hou&s;es, and places where I was unknown, on purpo&s;e to learn the currency of opinion.</Q> Whether the &s;en&s;e of this <HI>nation</HI> is to be had in &s;ome pot-hou&s;es and coffee-hou&s;es in this town of his own choo&s;ing, is a matter I leave to your judg|ment. <Q>And I never yet &s;aw any company of twelve men that condemned the book; but I have often found a greater number than twelve approving it; and this I think
<PB N="82" REF="81">is <HI>a fair way of collecting the natural currency of opinion.</HI> Do not then, Sir, be the in&s;tru|ment of drawing twelve men into a &s;ituation that may be <HI>injurious</HI> to them afterwards;</Q> injurious to them afterwards, tho&s;e words &s;peak for them&s;elves. He proceeds thus,</P>
<P>"I do not &s;peak this from policy," (what then?) "but from" (gentlemen, I will give you a hundred gue&s;&s;es) <Q>BENEVOLENCE! but if you chu&s;e to go on with the proce&s;s, I make it my reque&s;t that you would read this let|ter in Court, after which the Judge and the Jury may do as they plea&s;e. As I do not con&s;ider my&s;elf the object of the pro&s;ecution, neither can I be affected by the i&s;&s;ue one way or the other, I &s;hall, though a foreigner in your country, &s;ub&s;cribe as much money as any other man towards &s;upporting the right of the nation again&s;t the pro&s;ecution; and it is for this purpo&s;e only that I &s;hall do it.&mdash;THOMAS PAINE.</Q></P>
<P>So it is a &s;ub&s;cription defence you hear.</P>
<P><Q>P. S. I intended, had I &s;taid in England, to have publi&s;hed the information, with my remarks upon it,</Q>&mdash;that would have been a decent thing&mdash; <Q>before the trial came on; but as I am otherwi&s;e engaged, I re&s;erve my&s;elf till the trial is over, when I &s;hall re|ply fully to every thing you &s;hall advance;</Q> I hope in God he will not omit any one &s;ingle word that I have uttered to day, or &s;hall utter in my future addre&s;s to you. This <HI>conceited</HI> menace I de&s;pi&s;e, as I do tho&s;e of a nature more <HI>cut-throat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82">Gentlemen, I do not think that I need to trouble you any further for the pre&s;ent: ac|cording as you &s;hall be of opinion, that the nece&s;&s;arily mi&s;chievous tendency and intent of this book is that which I have taken the li|berty (at more length than I am warranted perhaps) to &s;tate to you; according as you &s;hall or &s;hall not be of that opinion, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;arily will be your verdict. I have done my duty in bringing before a Jury an offender of this magnitude. Be the event what it may, I <HI>have</HI> done my duty; I am &s;atisfied with hav|ing placed this great and flouri&s;hing com|munity under the powerful &s;hield of your protection.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I had fini&s;hed page 112, or &s;heet H, the proof &s;heet I, came into my hand; upon examining &s;heet I, there was a part, which, in my weak judgment, appeared of a dangerous tendency; I therefore immediately concluded
<PB N="86" REF="85">in my mind not to proceed any farther in the work; accordingly I wrote a &s;hort note to Mr. Paine; this was about two o'clock in the afternoon, determining to &s;end a letter, with the remainder of the copy. I felt a degree of re|luctance from the circum&s;tance of Mr. Paine's civilities that I had experienced as a gentle|man and an employer; and I was fear|ful I &s;hould not have courage in the morning to deliver up the copy; but a circum&s;tance occurred in the cour&s;e of the day, which en|abled me to do it with &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf. I will relate the circum&s;tance, if you will give me leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was Mr. Paine pre&s;ent when that cir|cum&s;tance happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was: and as it may, in the eyes of the Court, exculpate me from a charge that Mr. Paine has thought proper to bring again&s;t me, I &s;hall e&s;teem it a favor of the Court if they will &s;uffer me to mention every circum|&s;tance of that kind.&mdash;That very day at &s;ix o'clock Mr. Paine called upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect the day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a copy of that letter, which is dated the 17th of January, &s;o that he mu&s;t have called upon me on the 16th. Mr. Paine called upon me, and, as was rather unu&s;ual, at lea&s;t to my knowledge, he was rather intoxi|cated by liquor. He had, I believe, that day, dined with Mr. John&s;on, in Saint Paul's Church Yard. Being intoxicated he introduced a &s;ub|ject we have unfortunately differed on &s;everal times; the &s;ubject of religion, a favourite &s;ubject with him when intoxicated. I am
<PB N="87" REF="86">&s;orry to mention the&s;e circum&s;tances; but as it will ju&s;tify me in the eyes of the public, as part of the Appendix has done me material injury in my profe&s;&s;ion. The &s;ubject of de|bate ran very high; he oppo&s;ed every thing with great virulence, till at length he came to per&s;onal abu&s;e, very much &s;o, both to my&s;elf and Mrs. Chapman. An ob&s;ervation was made by Mrs. Chapman, late in the evening, I believe near ten o'clock, at which Mr. Paine was particularly offended; ri&s;ing up in a great pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid he had not been &s;o per&s;onally affronted in the whole cour&s;e of his life be|fore.</P>

<P>Mr. Paine accordingly ro&s;e in a great pa&s;&s;ion, declaring that, as I was a di|&s;&s;enter, he had a very bad opinion of di&s;&s;enters in general; he believed them all to be a pack of hypocrites, and therefore he mu&s;t deal very cautiou&s;ly with them, and begged, there|fore that in the morning, before I proceeded any further in his work, we &s;hould have a &s;et|tlement. I felt a degree of plea&s;ure in it, as it enabled me, with courage, next morning, to deliver up his copy, which I had before de|termined. I &s;ent a letter next morning, in|clo&s;ing the whole of his copy. He called upon me, and made many apologies for what
<PB N="88" REF="87">he had &s;aid: he &s;aid that it was the effect of liquor, and hoped that I would pa&s;s it over, and proceed with the work; but being de|termined on the matter, I would not upon any account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you &s;tate to him the rea&s;on why you would not go on with the work?</P>

<P>I did. The letter will &s;hew the rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Solicitor General.</SPEAKER>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As there can be no per&s;onal re&s;entment be|tween two &s;trangers, I write this letter to you, as to a man again&s;t whom I have no animo|&s;ity.</P>
<P>You have, as Attorney General, commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t me, as the Author of
<PB N="93" REF="92">Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in con&s;e|quence of my being elected a Member of the National Convention of France, called me from England, I &s;hould have &s;taid to have conte&s;ted the inju&s;tice of that pro&s;ecution; not upon my own account, for I cared not about the pro&s;ecution, but to have defended the prin|ciples I had advanced in the work.</P>
<P>The duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble my&s;elf about your pro&s;ecution: when I have lei&s;ure, I &s;hall have no objection to meet you on that ground; but as I now &s;tand, whether you go on with the pro&s;ecution, or whether you do not, or whether you obtain a verdict, or not, is a matter of the mo&s;t perfect indif|ference to me as an individual. If you ob|tain one (which you are welcome to, if you can get it) it cannot affect me either in per|&s;on, property, or reputation, otherwi&s;e than to increa&s;e the latter; and with re&s;pect to your&s;elf, it is as con&s;i&s;tent that you obtain a verdict again&s;t the Man in the Moon as again&s;t me: neither do I &s;ee how you can continue the pro&s;ecution again&s;t me as you would have done again&s;t one of <HI>your own people</HI> who had ab&s;ented him&s;elf becau&s;e he was pro&s;ecuted: what pa&s;&s;ed at Dover proves that my depar|ture from England was no &s;ecret.</P>
<P>My nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence from your country now, in con&s;equence of my duty here, affords the opportunity of knowing whether the pro|&s;ecution was intended again&s;t Thomas Paine, or again&s;t the Rights of the people of Eng|land to inve&s;tigate &s;y&s;tems and principles of
<PB N="94" REF="93">government; for as I cannot now be the ob|ject of the pro&s;ecution, the going on with the pro&s;ecution will &s;hew that &s;omething el&s;e was the object, and that &s;omething el&s;e can be no other than the people of England, for it is again&s;t <HI>their rights,</HI> and not again&s;t me, that a verdict or &s;entence can operate, if it can ope|rate at all. Be then &s;o candid as to tell the jury (if you chu&s;e to continue the proce&s;s) whom it is you are pro&s;ecuting, and on whom it is that the verdict is to fall.</P>
<P>But I have other rea&s;ons than tho&s;e I have mentioned for writing you this letter; and, however you may chu&s;e to interpret them, they proceed from a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too &s;erious to play with Court pro&s;ecutions, and &s;port with National Rights. The terrible examples that have taken place here, upon men who le&s;s than a year ago thought them&s;elves as &s;ecure as any pro&s;ecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney General, can now do in England, ought to have &s;ome weight with men in your &s;ituation. That the government of England is as great, if not the greate&s;t, perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place &s;ince governments be|gan, is what you cannot be a &s;tranger to, un|le&s;s the con&s;tant habit of &s;eeing it has blinded your &s;en&s;es; but though you may not chu&s;e to &s;ee it, the people are &s;eeing it very fa&s;t, and the progre&s;s is beyond what you may chu&s;e to believe. Is it po&s;&s;ible that you, or I can be|lieve, or that rea&s;on can make any other man believe, that the capacity of &s;uch a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate &s;ons, is
<PB N="95" REF="94">nece&s;&s;ary to the government of a nation. I &s;peak to you as one man ought to &s;peak to another; and I know al&s;o, that I &s;peak what other people are beginning to think.</P>
<P>That you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do it will &s;ignify nothing) without pack|ing a jury, (and we both know that &s;uch tricks are practi&s;ed) is what I have very good rea&s;on to believe. I have gone into coffee-hou&s;es, and places where I was unknown, on purpo&s;e to learn the currency of opinion, and I never yet &s;aw any company of twelve men that condemned the book; but I have often found a greater number than twelve approv|ing it, and this I think is a fair way of collect|ing the natural currency of opinion. Do not then, Sir, be the in&s;trument of drawing twelve men into a &s;ituation that may be in|jurious to them afterwards. I do not &s;peak this from policy, but from benevolence; but if you chu&s;e to go on with the proce&s;s, I make it my reque&s;t to you that you will read this letter in Court, after which the Judge and the Jury may do as they plea&s;e. As I do not con|&s;ider my&s;elf the object of the pro&s;ecution, neither can I be affected by the i&s;&s;ue, one way or the other, I &s;hall, though a foreigner in your country, &s;ub&s;cribe as much money as any other man towards &s;upporting the right of the Nation again&s;t the pro&s;ecution; and it is for this purpo&s;e only that I &s;hall do it.</P>

All hereditary government is in its na|ture tyranny. An heritable Crown, or an heritable Throne, or by what other fanciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a go|vernment, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds!</Q>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Page</HI> 47.</BIBL>
<P>This convention met at Philadelphia in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time connected with any of the State-govern|ments, or with Congre&s;s. He delivered up his commi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</P>
<P>The convention went deeply into all the &s;ubjects; and having, after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal con&s;titution, the next que&s;tion was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="98">For this purpo&s;e, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</P></Q>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Page</HI> 52.</BIBL>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Edwards and Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many in&s;tances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had re&s;tricted it. The Stuarts endeavoured to pa&s;s tho&s;e limits, and their fate is well known. In all tho&s;e in&s;tances we &s;ee nothing of a con&s;titution, but only of re&s;trictions on a&s;&s;umed power.</P>
<P>After this, another William, de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, and claiming from the &s;ame origin, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and of the two evils, <HI>James</HI> and <HI>William,</HI> the na|tion preferred what it thought the lea&s;t; &s;ince, from circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t take one. The Act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view. What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the Government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges? You &s;hall have &s;o much, and I will have the re&s;t; and with re&s;pect to the nation, it &s;aid, for <HI>your &s;hare,</HI> YOU <HI>&s;hall have the right of petitioning.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, the Bill of Rights is more properly a bill of wrongs, and of in|&s;ult.
<PB N="100" REF="99">As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it was a thing that made it&s;elf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few per&s;ons got together, and called them&s;elves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From the time of William, a &s;pecies of government aro&s;e, i&s;&s;uing out of this coali|tion Bill of Rights; and more &s;o, &s;ince the corruption introduced at the Hanover &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, by the agency of Walpole; that can be de&s;cribed by no other name than a de&s;potic legi&s;lation. Though the parts may embarra&s;s each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowleges out of it&s;elf is the right of petitioning. Where then is the Con&s;titution either that gives or that re&s;trains power?</P>
<P>It is not becau&s;e a part of the government is elective, that makes it le&s;s a de&s;poti&s;m, if the per&s;ons &s;o elected, po&s;&s;e&s;s afterwards, as a parliament, unlimited powers. Elec|tion, in this ca&s;e, becomes &s;eparated from repre&s;entation, and the candidates are can|didates for de&s;poti&s;m.</P></Q>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Page 56.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The attention of the Government of En|gland, (for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name, than the Engli&s;h Government) ap|pears,
<PB N="101" REF="100">&s;ince its political connexion with Ger|many, to have been &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed and ab&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic concerns are neglected; and with re&s;pect to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</P></Q>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Page 63. Note.</HI></BIBL>
<P>With re&s;pect to the two Hou&s;es, of which the Engli&s;h Parliament is compo&s;ed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legi&s;lature, to have no temper of its own. The Mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obedience.</P>
<P>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two Hou&s;es, the difference will ap|pear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;o little is this nicknamed Hou&s;e regarded, that the people &s;carcely enquire at any time what it is doing. It appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation</P></Q>
<Q><PB N="102" REF="101"><BIBL><HI>Pages</HI> 107-108.</BIBL>
<P>Having thus glanced at &s;ome of the de|fects of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, I proceed to what is called the Crown, upon which I &s;hall be very conci&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;ignifies a nominal office of a million &s;terling a year, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which con|&s;i&s;ts in receiving the money. Whether the per&s;on be wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;ane or in&s;ane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every mini&s;try acts upon the &s;ame idea&punc; that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people mu&s;t be hoodwinked, and held in &s;uper&s;titious ig|norance by &s;ome bugbear or other; and what is called the Crown an&s;wers this pur|po&s;e, and therefore it an&s;wers all the pur|po&s;es to be expected from it. This is more than can be &s;aid of the other two branches. The hazard to which this office is expo&s;ed in all countries, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation&mdash;the danger of its coming to its &s;en&s;es.</P></Q>

<P>I happened to be in England at the cele|bration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have always appeared to me dete&s;table; the one &s;eeking to de&s;troy his uncle, and the other her father, to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power them&s;elves; yet, as the nation was
<PB N="103" REF="102">di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;omething of that event, I felt hurt at &s;eeing it a&s;cribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had under|taken it as a job, and who, be&s;ides what he otherwi&s;e got, charged 600,000 l. for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Fir&s;t acted the &s;ame clo&s;e-fi&s;ted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, 250,000 l. over and above his pay as King; and hav|ing thus purcha&s;ed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian do|minions for his own private profit. In fact, every nation that does not govern it&s;elf, is governed as a job. England has been the prey of jobs over &s;ince the revolution.</P></Q>

<P>The fraud, hypocri&s;y, and impo&s;ition of governments, are now beginning to be too well under&s;tood to promi&s;e them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ari&s;to|cracy, in all countries, is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dre&s;&s;ing for the funeral. Let it then pa&s;s quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be comforted.</P>
<P>The time is not very di&s;tant when England will laugh at it&s;elf for &s;ending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brun&s;wick for men, at
<PB N="104" REF="103">the expence of a million a year, who under|&s;tood neither her laws, her language, nor her intere&s;t, and who&s;e capacities would &s;carcely have fitted them for the office of pari&s;h con|&s;table. If government could be tru&s;ted to &s;uch hands, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ea&s;y and &s;imple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpo&s;es may be found in every town and village in England.</P></Q>

<SPEAKER>The Honorable Thomas Er&s;kine.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>THE Attorney-General, in that part of his ad|dre&s;s which aro&s;e from a letter, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written to him from France, exhibited &s;igns of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility and emotion. I do not, I am &s;ure, charge him with acting a part to &s;educe you; on the contrary, I am per&s;uaded from my own feelings, and from my acquaintance with my friend from our childhood upwards, that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as he felt. But, gentlemen, if he felt tho&s;e painful embarra&s;&s;ments, think what mine mu&s;t be: he can only feel for the augu&s;t Character whom he repre&s;ents in this place, as a &s;ubject for his Sovereign, too far removed by cu&s;tom, and by law, from the intercour&s;es which generate affec|tions, to produce any other &s;entiments than tho&s;e that flow from a relation common to us all. But it will be remembered, that I &s;tand in the &s;ame relation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Er&s;kine is Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales.</NOTE> towards another Great Per&s;on, more deep|ly implicated by this &s;uppo&s;ed letter; who, not re&s;trained from the cultivation of per&s;onal attach|ment by tho&s;e qualifications which mu&s;t always &s;ecure them, has exalted my duty of a &s;ubject to a Prince, into a warm and hone&s;t affection between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and man. Thus circum&s;tanced, I certainly &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld have been glad to have had an earlier op|portunity of knowing correctly the content of this letter, and whether (which I po&s;itively deny) it
<PB N="106" REF="105">proceeded from the defendant. Coming thus &s;ud|denly upon us, I &s;ee but too plainly the impre&s;&s;ion it has made upon you who are to try the cau&s;e, and I feel its weight upon my&s;elf, who am to con|duct it; but this &s;hall neither detach me from my duty, nor, added to all the other difficulties th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thicken around me, enervate me (if I can hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, if the Attorney Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> founded in the commentaries he has made to you upon this book which he pro&s;ecutes; if he is war|ranted by the law of England, in repre&s;&s;ing its cir|culation through the&s;e realms, from the illegal and dangerous matters contained in it; if that &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion be, as he avows it, and as in common &s;en&s;e it mu&s;t be, the &s;ole object of the pro&s;ecution, the public has great rea&s;on to lament that this let|ter &s;hould have been at all brought into the &s;ervice of the cau&s;e: it is no part of the charge upon the record; it had no exi&s;tence for months after the work was compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed; it was not even written, if written at all, till after he had been at Dover, in a manner in&s;ultingly expelled from the country by the influence of government, and had become the &s;ubject of another country. It cannot, therefore, by any fair inference, even decypher the mind of the author when he com|po&s;ed his work; &s;till le&s;s can it affect the con|&s;truction of the language in which the work it|&s;elf is written. The introduction of this letter at all is, therefore, not only a departure from the charge, but a &s;ort of dereliction of the object of the pro&s;ecution, which is to condemn the book: for if the condemnation of the author is to be ob|tained, not by the work it&s;elf, but by collateral
<PB N="107" REF="106">matter not even exi&s;ting when it was written, nor known to its various publi&s;hers throughout the kingdom, how can a verdict upon &s;uch grounds condemn the work, or criminate other publi&s;hers, &s;trangers to the collateral matter on which the conviction may be obtained? I maintain, there|fore, that, upon every principle of &s;ound policy, as it affects the intere&s;ts of the crown, and upon every rule of ju&s;tice, as it affects the author of the Rights of Man, the letter &s;hould be wholly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Attorney General has thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that a rumour had been &s;pread, and had reached his ears, that he only car|ried on the pro&s;ecution as a public pro&s;ecutor, but without the concurrence of his own private judg|ment; and therefore to add the ju&s;t weight of his own character to his public duty, and to repel what he thinks a calumny, he tells you that he &s;hould have de&s;erved to have been driven from &s;ociety, if he had not arraigned the work and the author before you.</P>
<P>Here too we &s;tand in &s;ituations very different. I have no doubt of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a rumour, and of its having reached his ears, becau&s;e he &s;ays &s;o; but for the narrow circle in which any rumour, per&s;onally implicating my learned friend's charac|ter, has extended, I might appeal to the multitudes who &s;urround us, and a&s;k, which of all them, except the few connected in office with the crown, ever heard of its exi&s;tence. But with regard to my&s;elf, every man who hears me at this moment, nay, the whole People of England, have been wit|ne&s;&s;es to the calumnious clamour that, by every art, has been rai&s;ed and kept up again&s;t me: In every
<PB N="108" REF="107">place, where bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure collect the public together, day after day my name and character have been the topics of injurious reflection. And for what&mdash;only for not having &s;hrunk from the di&s;charge of a duty which no per&s;onal advantage recommended, and which a thou&s;and difficulties repelled. But, gentlemen, I have no complaint to make, either again&s;t the printers of the&s;e libels, nor even again&s;t their authors; the greater part of them, hurried perhaps away by hone&s;t prejudices, may have believed they were &s;erving their coun|try by rendering me the object of its &s;u&s;picion and contempt; and if there have been among&s;t them others who have mixed in it from per&s;onal malice and unkindne&s;s, I thank God I can forgive them al&s;o.&mdash;Little indeed did they know me, who thought that &s;uch proceedings would influence my conduct: I will for ever, at all hazards, a&s;&s;ert the dignity, independence, and integrity of the ENGLISH BAR; without which, impartial ju&s;tice, the mo&s;t valuable part of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, can have no exi&s;tence. For, from the moment that any advocate can be permitted to &s;ay, that he will or will not &s;tand between the crown and a &s;ubject arraigned in the court where he daily &s;its to practi&s;e, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end. If the advocate refu&s;es to defend, from what he may think of the charge or of the defence, he a&s;&s;umes the character of the judge; nay, he a&s;&s;umes it before the hour of judgment; and, in proportion to his rank and re|putation, puts the heavy influence of, perhaps, a mi&s;taken opinion into the &s;cale again&s;t the accu&s;ed, in who&s;e favour the benevolent principle of En|gli&s;h
<PB N="109" REF="108">law makes all pre&s;umptions, and which com|mands the very Judge to be his coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is now my duty to addre&s;s my|&s;elf regularly and without digre&s;&s;ion to the defence. And the fir&s;t thing which pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of a judicial &s;ubject, and indeed of every other, is to &s;tate di&s;tinctly, and with preci&s;ion, what the que&s;tion is, and (where prejudice and mi&s;re|pre&s;entation have been exerted), to di&s;tingui&s;h it accurately from what it is not. The que&s;tion then is NOT whether the con&s;titution of our fathers, under which we live&mdash;under which I pre&s;ent my&s;elf before you, and under which alone you have any juri&s;diction to hear me,&mdash;be or be not preferable to the con&s;titution of America or France, or any other human con&s;titution. For upon what principle can a court, con&s;tituted by the authority of any government, and admini&s;tering a po&s;itive &s;y&s;tem of law under it, pronounce a de|ci&s;ion again&s;t the con&s;titution which creates its au|thority; or the rule of action which its juri&s;diction is to enforce? The common &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t uninformed per&s;on mu&s;t revolt at &s;uch an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I have no difficulty, therefore, in admitting, that if by accident &s;ome or all of you were alienated in opinion and affection from the forms and princi|ples of the Engli&s;h government, and were im|pre&s;&s;ed with the value of that unmixed repre&s;en|tative con&s;titution which this work recommends and inculcates, you could not, on that account, acquit the defendant. Nay, to &s;peak out plainly, I freely admit, that even if you were avowed ene|mies to monarchy, and devoted to republicani&s;m, you would be neverthele&s;s bound by your oaths,
<PB N="110" REF="109">as a jury &s;worn to admini&s;ter Engli&s;h ju&s;tice, to con|vict the author of the Rights of Man, if it were brought home to your con&s;ciences, that he had ex|ceeded tho&s;e widely extended bounds which the ancient wi&s;dom and liberal policy of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution have allotted to the range of a free pre&s;s. I freely concede this, becau&s;e you have no juri&s;diction to judge either the author or the work, by any rule but by the Engli&s;h law, which is the &s;ource of your authority. But having made this large conce&s;&s;ion, it follows, by a con&s;equence &s;o inevitable as to be invulnerable to all argument or artifice, that if, on the other hand, you &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed (which I know you to be) not only with a dutiful regard, but with an enthu&s;ia&s;m, for the whole form and &s;ub&s;tance of your own government; and though you &s;hould think that this work, in its circulation among&s;t cla&s;&s;es of men unequal to po|litical re&s;earches, may tend to alienate opinion, &s;till you cannot, upon the&s;e grounds, without a &s;imilar breach of duty, convict the defendant of a libel, unle&s;s he has clearly &s;tepped beyond that extended range of communication which the &s;ame ancient wi&s;dom and liberal policy of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution has allotted for the liberty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I admit, with the Attorney Gene|ral, that in every ca&s;e where a court has to e&s;ti|mate the quality of a writing, the mind and in|tention of the writer mu&s;t be taken into the ac|count; the bona, or mala fides, as lawyers ex|pre&s;s it, mu&s;t be examined: for a writing may undoubtedly proceed from a motive, and be directed to a purpo&s;e, not to be decyphered by the mere con&s;truction of the thing written. But wherever a writing is arraigned as &s;editious or &s;landerous,
<PB N="111" REF="110">not upon its ordinary con&s;truction in language, nor from the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of its publi|cation, under any circum&s;tances and at all times, but that the criminality &s;prings from &s;ome extrin|&s;ic matter, not vi&s;ible upon the page it&s;elf, nor univer&s;ally operative, but capable only of being connected with it by evidence, &s;o as to demon|&s;trate the effect of the publication, and the de&s;ign of the publi&s;her; &s;uch a writing, not libellous PER SE, cannot be arraigned as the author's work is arraigned upon the record before the court. I maintain, without the hazard of contradiction, that the law of England po&s;itively requires, for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject, that every charge of a li|bel complicated with extrin&s;ic facts and circum|&s;tances, <HI>dehors the writing,</HI> mu&s;t appear literally upon the record, that the defendant may know what crime he is called upon to an&s;wer, and how to &s;tand upon his defence. What crime is it that the defendant comes to an&s;wer for to day? what is the notice that I, who am his coun&s;el, have from this parchment of the crime alleged again&s;t him? I come to defend his having written this book. The record &s;tates nothing el&s;e: the charge of &s;edition in the introduction is notoriou&s;ly paper and pack-thread, and the innuendos cannot enlarge the &s;en&s;e, or natural con&s;truction of the text. The record does not &s;tate any one extrin&s;ic fact or cir|cum&s;tance, to render the work criminal, at one time more than another; it &s;tates no peculiarity of time, or &s;ea&s;on, or intention, not proveable from the writing it&s;elf, which is the naked charge upon record. There is nothing therefore which, upon any principle of Engli&s;h law, gives you any juri&s;|diction beyond the con&s;truction of the <HI>work it&s;elf;</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="111">and you cannot be ju&s;tified in finding it criminal becau&s;e publi&s;hed at this time, unle&s;s it would have been a criminal publication under any cir|cum&s;tances, or at any other time.</P>
<P>The law of England then, both in its forms and &s;ub&s;tance, being the only rule by which the author or the work can be ju&s;tified or condemned, and the charge upon the record being the naked charge of a libel, the cau&s;e re&s;olves it&s;elf into a que&s;tion of the deepe&s;t importance to us all, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE LIBERTY OF THE ENGLISH PRESS.</P>
<P>But before I enter upon it, I wi&s;h to fulfil a duty to the defendant, which, if I do not deceive my|&s;elf, is at this moment peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to his impartial trial.&mdash;If an advocate entertains &s;enti|ments injurious to the defence he is engaged in, he is not only ju&s;tified, but bound in duty, to conceal them; &s;o, on the other hand, if his own genuine &s;entiments, or any thing connected with his character or &s;ituation, can add &s;trength to his profe&s;&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he is bound to throw them into the &s;cale: in addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, therefore, to gentlemen not only zealous for the honour of Engli&s;h government, but vi&s;ibly indignant at any attack upon its principles, and who would, per|haps, be impatient of arguments from a &s;u&s;pected quarter, I give my client the benefit of declaring, that I am, and ever have been, attached to the genuine principles of the Briti&s;h government; and that, however the court or you may reject the application, I defend him upon principles not only con&s;i&s;tent with its permanence and &s;ecu|rity, but, without the e&s;tabli&s;hment of which, it never could have had an exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="112">The propo&s;ition which I mean to maintain as the ba&s;is of the liberty of the pre&s;s, and without which it is an empty &s;ound, is this:</P>
<P>That every man, not intending to mi&s;lead and to confound, but &s;eeking to enlighten others with what his own rea&s;on and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cience, however erroneou&s;ly, dictate t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him as truth, may addre&s;s him&s;elf to the univer&s;al rea&s;on of a whole nation, either upon the &s;ubject of governments in gene|ral, or upon that of our own particular country: that he may analy&s;e the principles of its con&s;ti|tution, point out its errors and defects, examine and publi&s;h its corruptions, warn his fellow-citi|zens again&s;t their ruinous con&s;equences, and ex|ert his whole faculties in pointing out the mo&s;t advantageous changes in e&s;tabli&s;hments which he con&s;iders to be radically defective, or &s;liding from their object by abu&s;e.&mdash;All this every &s;ub|ject of this country has a right to do, if he con|templates only what he thinks its happine&s;s, and but &s;eeks to change the public mind by the con|viction which flows from rea&s;onings dictated by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>If, indeed, he writes what he does not think; if, contemplating the mi&s;ery of others, he wick|edly condemns what his own under&s;tanding ap|proves; or, even admitting his real di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the government or its corruptions, if he calumni|ates <HI>living magi&s;trates,</HI> or holds out to individuals, that they have a right to run before the public mind in their conduct; that they may oppo&s;e by contumacy or force what private rea&s;on only di&s;|approves; that they may di&s;obey the law, becau&s;e their judgment condemns it; or re&s;i&s;t the public will, becau&s;e they hone&s;tly wi&s;h to change it: he
<PB N="114" REF="113">is then a criminal upon every principle of ration|al policy, as well as upon the immemorial prece|dents of Engli&s;h ju&s;tice; becau&s;e &s;uch a per&s;on &s;eeks to di&s;unite individuals from their duty to the whole, and excites to overt acts of mi&s;con|duct in a part of the community, in&s;tead of en|deavouring to change, by the impul&s;e of rea&s;on, that univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent which, in this and in every country, con&s;titutes the law for all.</P>
<P>I have therefore no difficulty in admitting that, if, upon an attentive peru&s;al of this work, it &s;hall be found that the defendant has promul|gated any doctrines which tend to withdraw in|dividuals from their &s;ubjection to the law by which the whole nation con&s;ents to be governed; nay, if the direct contrary &s;hall not be found to be &s;tudi|ou&s;ly inculcated&mdash;if his book &s;hall be found to have warranted or excited that unfortunate criminal who appeared here ye&s;terday to endeavour to re|lieve him&s;elf from impri&s;onment, by the de&s;truc|tion of a pri&s;on, while the law of impri&s;onment remained, or dictated to him the language of de|fiance which ran through his whole defence&mdash;if throughout the whole work there &s;hall be found any &s;yllable or letter, which &s;trikes at the &s;ecurity of property, or which hints that any thing le&s;s than the whole nation can con&s;titute the law, or that the law, be it what it may, is not the inex|orable rule of action for every individual, I wil|lingly yield him up to the ju&s;tice of the court.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;ay, in the name of Thomas Paine, and in his words as author of the Rights of Man, as written in the very volume that is charged with &s;eeking the de&s;truction of pro|perty,</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114"><Q>The end of all political a&s;&s;ociations is, The pre&s;ervation of the rights of man, which rights are liberty, property, and &s;e|curity; that the nation is the &s;ource of all &s;overeignty derived from it: the right of pro|perty being &s;ecured and inviolable, no one ought to be deprived of it, except in ca&s;es of evident public nece&s;&s;ity, legally a&s;certain|ed, and on condition of a previous ju&s;t in|demnity.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are undoubtedly the rights of man&mdash;the rights for which all governments are e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;and the only rights Mr. Paine contends for; but which he thinks (no matter whether right or wrong) are better to be &s;ecured by a republican con&s;titution than by the forms of the Engli&s;h government. He in&s;tructs me to admit, that, when government is once con&s;tituted, no indi|viduals, without rebellion, can withdraw their obedience from it&mdash;that all attempts to excite them to it are highly criminal, for the mo&s;t ob|vious rea&s;ons of policy and ju&s;tice&mdash;that nothing &s;hort of the will of a whole people can change or affect the rule by which a nation is to be go|verned&mdash;and that no private opinion, however hone&s;tly inimical to the forms or &s;ub&s;tance of the law, can ju&s;tify re&s;i&s;tance to its authority, while it remains in force. The author of the Rights of Man not only admits the truth of all this doctrine, but he con&s;ents to be convicted, and I al&s;o con&s;ent for him, unle&s;s his work &s;hall be found &s;tudiou&s;ly and painfully to inculcate the&s;e great principles of government which it is charged to have been written to de&s;troy. Let
<PB N="116" REF="115">me not, therefore, be &s;u&s;pected to be contending, that it is lawful to write a book pointing out de|fects in the Engli&s;h government, and exciting in|dividuals to de&s;troy its &s;anctions, and to refu&s;e obedience. But, on the other hand, I do con|tend, that it is lawful to addre&s;s the Engli&s;h na|tion on the&s;e momentous &s;ubjects, for had it not been for this unalienable right (thanks be to God and our fathers for e&s;tabli&s;hing it), how &s;hould we have had this con&s;titution which we &s;o loud|ly boa&s;t of? If, in the march of the human mind, no man could have gone before the e&s;ta|bli&s;hments of the time he lived in, how could our e&s;tabli&s;hment, by reiterated changes, have become what it is? If no man could have awak|ened the public mind to errors and abu&s;es in our government, how could it have pa&s;&s;ed on from &s;tage to &s;tage, through reformation and revolu|tion, &s;o as to have arrived from barbari&s;m to &s;uch a pitch of happine&s;s and perfection that the Attorney General con&s;iders it as profanation to touch it any further, or to look for any future amendment.</P>
<P>In this manner power has rea&s;oned in every age&mdash;government, in <HI>its own e&s;timation,</HI> has been at all times a &s;y&s;tem of perfection; but a free pre&s;s has examined and detected its errors, and the people have happily reformed them: this freedom has alone made our government what it is, and alone can pre&s;erve it; and therefore, un|der the banners of that freedom, to-day I &s;tand up to defend Thomas Paine. But how, alas! &s;hall this ta&s;k be accompli&s;hed? How may I ex|pect from you what human nature has not made man for the performance of? How am I to ad|dre&s;s
<PB N="117" REF="116">your rea&s;ons, or a&s;k them to pau&s;e, amid&s;t the torrent of prejudice which has hurried away the public mind on the &s;ubject you are to judge?</P>
<P>Was any Engli&s;hman ever &s;o brought as a cri|minal before an Engli&s;h court of ju&s;tice?&mdash;If I were to a&s;k you, gentlemen of the jury, what is the choice&s;t fruit that grows upon the tree of Engli&s;h liberty, you would an&s;wer, SECURITY UNDER THE LAW. If I were to a&s;k the whole people of England, the return they looked for at the hands of government, for the burthens under which they bend to &s;upport it, I &s;hould &s;till be an&s;wered, SECURITY UNDER THE LAW; or, in other words, an impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. So &s;acred, therefore, has the freedom or trial been ever held in England; &s;o anxiou&s;ly does Ju&s;tice guard again&s;t every po&s;&s;ible bias in her path, that if the public mind has been locally agitated upon any &s;ubject in judgment, the forum is either changed, or the trial po&s;tponed. The circulation of any paper that brings, or which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to bring, prejudice, or even well founded know|ledge, within the reach of a Briti&s;h tribunal, on the &s;pur of an occa&s;ion, is not only highly crimi|nal, but defeats it&s;elf, by leading to put off the trial which its object was to pervert. On this principle, his lord&s;hip will permit me to remind him, that on the trial of the Dean of St. A&s;aph for a libel, or rather when he was brought to trial, the circulation of books by a &s;ociety favourable to his defence, was held by the noble lord, as Chief Ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, to be a rea&s;on for not trying the cau&s;e; although th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y contained no matter relative to the Dean, nor to the object of his trial;
<PB N="118" REF="117">being only extracts from ancient authors of high reputation, on the general rights of juries to con|&s;ider the innocence as well as the guilt of the ac|cu&s;ed, yet &s;till, as the recollection of the&s;e rights was pre&s;&s;ed forward with a view to affect the pro|ceedings, to guard the principle the proceedings were po&s;tponed.</P>
<P>Is the defendant then to be the only exception to the&s;e admirable provi&s;ions?&mdash;Is the Engli&s;h law to judge him, &s;tript of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he armour with which its univer&s;al ju&s;tice encircles all others?&mdash;Shall we, in the very act of judging him for detracting from the Engli&s;h government, furni&s;h him with ample matter for ju&s;t reprobation, in&s;tead of detraction? Has not his cau&s;e been prejudged through a thou|&s;and channels? Has not the work before you been daily publicly reviled, and his per&s;on held up to deri&s;ion and reproach? Has not the public mind been excited, by crying down the very phra&s;e and idea of the Rights of Man? Nay, have not a&s;&s;oci|ations of gentlemen, I &s;peak it with regret, be|cau&s;e I am per&s;uaded, from what I know of &s;ome of them, that they, among&s;t them at lea&s;t, thought they were &s;erving the public; yet have they not, in utter contempt and ignorance of that con&s;titu|tion of which they declare them&s;elves to be the guardians, publi&s;hed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t attacks upon the defendant? Have they not, even while the cau&s;e has been &s;tanding here in the paper for immediate trial, publi&s;hed a direct prote&s;t again&s;t the very work now before you; adverti&s;ing in the &s;ame paper, though under the general de&s;cription of &s;e|ditious papers, a reward on the conviction of any per&s;on who &s;hould dare to &s;ell the book it&s;elf, to which their own publication was an an&s;wer?&mdash;The
<PB N="119" REF="118">Attorney-General has &s;poken of a forced circula|tion of this work; but how have the&s;e prejudging papers been circulated? we all know how: they have been thrown into our carriages in every &s;treet; they have met us at every turnpike; and they lie in the areas of all our hou&s;es. To complete the triumph of prejudice, that high tribunal, of which I have the honour to be a member, (my learned friends know what I &s;ay to be true) has been drawn into this vortex of &s;lander; and &s;ome of its mem|bers, for I do not &s;peak of the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, have thrown the weight of their &s;tations into the &s;ame &s;cale.</P>
<P>By all means I maintain that this cau&s;e has been prejudged.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that I have made no motion to put off the trial for the&s;e cau&s;es, and that courts of them&s;elves take no cognizance of what pa&s;&s;es el&s;ewhere, without facts laid before them. Gen|tlemen, I know that I &s;hould have had equal ju&s;tice from that quarter, if I had brought my&s;elf within the rule. But when &s;hould I have been better in the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of things? And there|fore I only remind you of all the&s;e hard&s;hips, that you may recollect that your judgment is to proceed upon that alone which meets you here, upon the evidence in the cau&s;e, and not upon &s;ugge&s;tions de&s;tructive of every principle of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Having di&s;po&s;ed of the&s;e foreign prejudices, I hope you will as little regard &s;ome arguments that have been offered to you in court. The letter which has been &s;o repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed upon you, ought to di&s;mi&s;s even from your recollection; I have already put it out of the que&s;tion, as having been written long &s;ub&s;equent to the book, and as
<PB N="120" REF="119">being a libel on the king, which no part of the in|formation charges, and which may hereafter be pro&s;ecuted as a di&s;tinct offence. I con&s;ider that letter be&s;ides, and indeed have always heard it treated, as a forgery, contrived to injure the me|rits of the cau&s;e, and to embarra&s;s me per&s;onally in its defence. I have a right &s;o to con&s;ider it, becau&s;e it is un&s;upported by any thing &s;imilar at an earlier period. The defendant's whole deport|ment, previous to the publication, has been wholly unexceptionable: he properly de&s;ired to be given up as the author of the book, if any enquiry &s;hould take place concerning it; and he is not affected in evidence, directly or indirectly, with any illegal or &s;u&s;picious conduct; not even with having ut|tered an indi&s;creet or taunting expre&s;&s;ion, nor with any one matter or thing, incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty of the be&s;t &s;ubject in England. His opinions in|deed were adver&s;e to our &s;y&s;tem; but I maintain that OPINION is free, and that CONDUCT alone is amenable to the law.</P>

<P>In an&s;wer to this &s;tatement, which after all &s;tands only upon Mr. Attorney General's own a&s;&s;ertion, un&s;upported by any kind of proof (no witne&s;s having proved the author's per&s;onal inter|ference with the &s;ale), I &s;till maintain, that if he had the mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly promoted it, the que&s;tion would remain exactly the &s;ame: the que&s;tion would &s;till be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whether at the time when Paine compo&s;ed his work, and promoted the mo&s;t exten&s;ive pur|cha&s;e of it, he believed or di&s;believed what he had written, and whether he contemplated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he hap|pine&s;s or the mi&s;ery of the Engli&s;h nation, to which it is addre&s;&s;ed; and whichever of the&s;e intentions may be evidenced to your judgments upon read|ing the book it&s;elf, I confe&s;s I am utterly at a lo&s;s to comprehend how a writer can be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean &s;omething different from what he has writ|ten, by an anxiety (common I believe to all au|thors) that his work &s;hould be generally read.</P>

In drawing the one or the other of the&s;e conclu&s;ions, the book &s;tands fir&s;t in order, and it &s;hall now &s;peak for it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the whole of it is in evidence be|fore you; the particular parts arraigned having only been read by my con&s;ent, upon the pre&s;ump|tion that on retiring from the court, you would carefully compare them with the context, and all the parts with the whole viewed together. You cannot indeed do ju&s;tice without it. The mo&s;t common letter, even in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu|&s;ine&s;s, cannot be read in a cau&s;e to prove an obli|gation for twenty &s;hillings without the whole be|ing read, that the writer's meaning may be &s;een without deception. But in a criminal charge of only four pages and a half, out of a work con|taining nearly two hundred, you cannot, with even the appearance of common ju&s;tice, pronounce a judgment without the mo&s;t deliberate and cautious compari&s;on. I ob&s;erve that the noble and learned judge confirms me in this ob&s;ervation. But if any given part of a work be legally explanatory of every other part of it, the preface, a fortiori, is the mo&s;t material; becau&s;e the preface is the author's own key to his writing: it is there that he takes the reader by the hand, and introduces him to his &s;ub|ject:
<PB N="123" REF="122">it is there that the &s;pirit and intention of the whole is laid before him by way of prologue. A preface is meant by the author as a clue to ignorant or carele&s;s readers: the author &s;ays by it, to every man who choo&s;es to begin where he ought, look at my plan&mdash;attend to my di&s;tinctions&mdash;mark the purpo&s;e and limitations of the matter I lay before you.</P>
<P>Let then the calumniators of Thomas Paine now attend to his preface, where, to leave no excu&s;e for ignorance or mi&s;repre&s;entation, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:</P>
<Q><P>I have differed from &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional gen|tlemen on the &s;ubject of pro&s;ecutions, and I &s;ince find they are falling into my opinion, which I will here &s;tate as fully, but as con|ci&s;ely as I can.</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t put a ca&s;e with re&s;pect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It would be an act of de&s;poti&s;m, or what in England is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohibit inve&s;tigating the principles, good or bad, on which &s;uch a law, or any other, is founded.</P>
<P>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppo&s;e the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expo&s;e its errors, to rea&s;on on its de|fects, and to &s;hew cau&s;e why it &s;hould be repealed, or why another ought to be &s;ub|&s;tituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it al&s;o my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making u&s;e at
<PB N="124" REF="123">the &s;ame time of every argument to &s;hew its errors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it; becau&s;e the precedent of break|ing a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to a di&s;cretionary violation, of tho&s;e which are good.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with principles and forms of government, or to what are called con&s;titutions and the parts of which they are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandi&s;ement of particular in|dividuals, that government ought to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and that mankind are at the expence of &s;upporting it. The defects of every government and con&s;titution, both as to principle and form, mu&s;t, on a parity of rea&s;oning, be as open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as the defects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to &s;ociety to point them out. When tho&s;e defects, and the means of remedying them are generally &s;een by a nation, that nation will reform its go|vernment or its con&s;titution in the one ca&s;e, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other.</P></Q>
<P>Gentlemen, you mu&s;t undoubtedly wi&s;h to deal with every man who comes before you in judg|ment, as you would be dealt by your&s;elves; and &s;urely you will not lay it down to day as a law to be binding hereafter even upon your&s;elves, that if you &s;hould publi&s;h any opinion concerning the exi&s;t|ing abu&s;es in your country's government, and point out to the whole public the means of amendment, you are to be acquitted or convicted as any twelve
<PB N="125" REF="124">men may happen to agree with you in your opi|nions. Yet this is preci&s;ely what you are a&s;ked to do to another: it is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e before you. Mr. Paine expre&s;sly &s;ays, I obey a law until it is repealed; obedience is not only my principle but my practice, &s;ince my di&s;obedience of a law from thinking it bad, might apply to ju&s;tify another man in the di&s;obedience of a good one; and thus in|dividuals would give the rule for them&s;elves, and not &s;ociety for all.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you will pre&s;ently &s;ee that the &s;ame principle pervades the re&s;t of the work; and I am the more anxious to call your attention to it, however repetition may tire you, becau&s;e it unfolds the whole principle of my argument: for, if you find a &s;entence in the whole book that inve&s;ts any individual, or any number of indivi|duals, or any community &s;hort of the whole na|tion, with a power of changing any part of the law or con&s;titution, I abandon the cau&s;e&mdash;YES, I freely abandon it, becau&s;e I will not affront the maje&s;ty of a court of ju&s;tice by maintaining propo&s;itions which, even upon the &s;urface of them, are fal&s;e. Mr. Paine, page 162&mdash;168, goes on thus:</P>
<P><Q>When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be go|verned as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accompli&s;hed by rea&s;on. Rebellion con&s;i&s;ts in forcibly oppo&s;ing the general will of a nation, whether by a party or by a government. There ought, there|fore,
<PB N="126" REF="125">to be, in every nation, a method of occa&s;ionall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;certaining the &s;tate of public opinion with re&s;pect to government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is, therefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter re&s;pecting a general re|form; and, by the &s;ame right that two per|&s;ons can confer on &s;uch a &s;ubject, a thou|&s;and may. The object in all &s;uch prelimi|nary proceedings is, to find out what the general &s;en&s;e of a nation is, and to be go|verned by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or choo&s;e to pay ten times more taxes than there is occa&s;ion for, it has a right &s;o to do; and, &s;o long as the majority do not impo&s;e conditions on the minority different to what they impo&s;e on them&s;elves, though there may be much error, there is no inju&s;tice; neither will the error continue long. Rea&s;on and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will &s;oon bring things right, however wrong they may begin. By &s;uch a proce&s;s no tumult is to be apprehended. The poor, in all countries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their intere&s;t and happine&s;s are included. It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e are the &s;entiments of the au|thor of the Rights of Man; and, whatever his opinions may be of the defects in our govern|ment, it never can change our &s;entiments con|cerning it, if our &s;entiments are ju&s;t; and a writ|ing
<PB N="127" REF="126">can never be &s;editious in the &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h law, which &s;tates that the government leans on the univer&s;al will for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this univer&s;al will is the be&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t title which his Maje&s;ty and his family have to the throne of the&s;e kingdoms; and in proportion to the wi&s;dom of our in&s;titutions, the title mu&s;t in common &s;en&s;e become the &s;tronger: &s;o little idea, indeed, have I of any other, that in my place in Parliament, not a week ago, I con&s;idered it as the be&s;t way of expre&s;&s;ing my attachment to the con&s;titution, as e&s;tabli&s;hed at the revolution, to declare (I believe in the pre|&s;ence of the heir apparent of the crown, for whom I have the greate&s;t per&s;onal zeal) that his Maje&s;ty reigned in England, by choice and con|&s;ent, as the magi&s;trate of the Engli&s;h people; not indeed a con&s;ent and choice by per&s;onal election, like a King of Poland, the wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible con&s;titutions; but by the election of a family for great national objects, in defiance of that heredi|tary right, which only becomes tyranny, in the &s;en&s;e of Mr. Paine, when it claims to inherit a nation, in&s;tead of governing by their con&s;ent, and continuing for its benefit.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this &s;entiment has the advantage of Mr. Burke's high authority, who &s;ays with great truth, in a letter to his con&s;tituents, <Q>Too little dependance cannot be had at this time of day on names and prejudices: the eyes of mankind are opened; and communities mu&s;t be held together by a vi&s;ible and &s;olid inte|re&s;t.</Q> I believe, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the Prince of Wales will always render this title dear to the people. The Attorney General can
<PB N="128" REF="127">only tell you what he believes of him; I can tell you what I know, and what I am bound to de|clare, &s;ince this Prince may be traduced and ca|lumniated in every part of the kingdom, without its coming often in que&s;tion, till brought in to load a defence with matter collateral to the charge. I therefore a&s;&s;ert what the Attorney General can only hope, that, whenever that Prince &s;hall come to the throne of this country (which I hope, but by the cour&s;e of nature, will never happen), he will make the con&s;titution of Great Britain the foundation of all his conduct.</P>
<P>Having now, Gentlemen, e&s;tabli&s;hed the au|thor's general intention by his own introduction, which is the be&s;t and faire&s;t expo&s;ition, let us next look at the occa&s;ion which gave it birth.</P>
<P>The Attorney General, throughout the whole cour&s;e of his addre&s;s to you (I knew it would be &s;o), has avoided the mo&s;t di&s;tant notice or hint of any circum&s;tance having led to the appearance of the author in the political world, after a &s;ilence of &s;o many years; he has not even pronounced, or even glanced at the name of Mr. Burke, but has left you to take it for granted that the defendant volunteered this delicate and momentous &s;ubject; and that, without being led to it by the provo|cation of political controver&s;y, he had &s;eized a favourable moment to &s;tigmati&s;e, from mere malice, and again&s;t his own confirmed opinions, the Con&s;titu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of this Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my learned friend knows too well my re&s;pect and value for him to &s;uppo&s;e that I am charging him w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th a wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; I know him to be incapable of it; he knew it would come from me. He will premit me,
<PB N="129" REF="128">however, to lament that it &s;hould have been left for me, at this late period of the cau&s;e, to inform you, that, not only the work before you, but the Fir&s;t Part, of which it is a natural continuation, were written <HI>avowedly, and upon the face of them,</HI> IN ANSWER TO MR. BURKE. They were writ|ten be&s;ides under circum&s;tances which I &s;hall hereafter explain, and in the cour&s;e of which explanation I may have occa&s;ion to cite a few pa&s;&s;ages from the works of that celebrated per&s;on. And I &s;hall &s;peak of him with the high|e&s;t re&s;pect: for, with whatever contempt he may delight to look down upon my humble talents, however he may di&s;parage the principles which direct my public conduct, he &s;hall never force me to forget the regard which this country owes to him for the writings which he has left upon record for the illumination of our mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity. After the gratitude which we owe to God for the divine gifts of rea&s;on and un|der&s;tanding, our next thanks are due to tho&s;e from the fountain of who&s;e enlightened minds they are fed and fructified. But pleading, as I do, the cau&s;e of freedom of opinions, I &s;hall not give offence by remarking that this great author has been thought to have changed &s;ome of his; and, if Thomas Paine had not thought &s;o, I &s;hould not now be addre&s;&s;ing you, becau&s;e the book which is my &s;ubject would never have been written. Who is right and who is wrong, in the contention of doctrines, I have repeatedly di&s;|claimed to be the que&s;tion; I can only &s;ay that Mr. Paine may be right throughout, but that Mr. Burke cannot&mdash;Mr. Paine has been uniform in his opinions, but Mr. Burke has not&mdash;Mr.
<PB N="130" REF="129">Burke can only be right in part; but, &s;hould Mr. Paine be even mi&s;taken in the whole, &s;till I am not removed from the principle of his de|fence. My defence has nothing to do with ei|ther the concealment or rectitude of his doc|trines. I admit Mr. Paine to be a republican; you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee what made him one&mdash;I do not &s;eek to &s;hade or qualify his attack upon our con|&s;titution; I put my defence on no &s;uch matter&mdash; he undoubtedly means to declare it to be defec|tive in its forms, and contaminated with abu&s;es, which, in his judgment, will one day or other bring on the ruin of us all: it is in vain to mince the matter; this is the &s;cope of his work. But &s;till, if it contains no attack upon the King's Maje&s;ty, nor upon any other living magi&s;trate; if it excites to no re&s;i&s;tance to magi&s;tracy, but, on the contrary, if it even inculcates, as it does, obe|dience to government, then, whatever may be its defects, the que&s;tion continues as before, and ever mu&s;t remain an unmixed que&s;tion of the li|berty of the pre&s;s. I therefore con&s;idered it as no breach of profe&s;&s;ional duty, nor injurious to the cau&s;e I am defending, to expre&s;s my own admiration of the real principles of our con&s;titu|tion&mdash; a con&s;titution which I hope never to &s;ee give way to any other&mdash;a con&s;titution which has been productive of various benefits, and which will produce many more hereafter, if we have wi&s;dom e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough to pluck up tho&s;e weeds that grow in the riche&s;t &s;oils and among&s;t the bright|e&s;t flowers. I agree with the merchants of London, that the Engli&s;h government is equal to the reformation of its own abu&s;es; and, as an in|habitant of the city, I would have &s;igned their
<PB N="131" REF="130">Declaration, if I had known, <HI>of my own know|ledge,</HI> the facts recited in its preamble. But abu&s;es the Engli&s;h con&s;titution unque&s;tionably has which call loudly for reformation, the exi&s;tence of which has been the theme of our greate&s;t &s;tate&s;men, which have too plainly formed the principles of the defendant, and created the very conjuncture which produced his book.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we all but too well remember the calamitous &s;ituation in which our country &s;tood but a few years ago&mdash;a &s;ituation which no man can look back upon without horror, nor feel him&s;elf &s;afe from relap&s;ing into again, while the cau&s;es remain which produced it. The event I allude to you mu&s;t know to be the American war and the &s;till exi&s;ting cau&s;es of it, the corrup|tions of this government. In tho&s;e days it was not thought virtue by the patriots of England to conceal their exi&s;tence from the people; but then, as now, authority condemned them as di&s;|affected &s;ubjects, and defeated the ends they &s;ought by their promulgation.</P>
<P>Hear the opinion of Sir George Saville;&mdash;not his &s;peculative opinion concerning the &s;tructure of our government in the ab&s;tract, but his opi|nion of the &s;ettled abu&s;es which prevailed in his own time, and which continue at this moment. But fir&s;t let me remind you who Sir George Sa|ville was&mdash;I fear we &s;hall hardly look upon his like again&mdash;How &s;hall I de&s;cribe him to you?&mdash; In my own words I cannot. I was lately com|mended by Mr. Burke, in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, for &s;trengthening my own language by an appeal to Dr. John&s;on.

<P><Q>His fortune is among the large&s;t; a for|tune, which, wholly unincumb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red as it is, without one &s;ingle charge from luxury, vanity, or exce&s;s, &s;inks under the benevolence of its di&s;pen&s;er. This private benevolence, ex|panding it&s;elf into patrioti&s;m, renders his whole being the e&s;tate of the public, in which he has not re&s;erved a <HI>peculium</HI> for him&s;elf of profit, diver&s;ion, or relaxation. During the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t in, and the la&s;t out of the Hou&s;e of Commons; he pa&s;&s;es from the &s;enate to the camp; and, &s;eldom &s;eeing the &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, he is always in Parliament to &s;erve his country, or in the field to defend it.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cribe to &s;uch a character any principle but patrioti&s;m, when he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P><Q>I return to you baffled and di&s;pirited, and I am &s;orry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope of &s;eeing any change in the mi&s;erable cour&s;e of public ca|lamities.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On this melancholy day of account, in rendering up to you my tru&s;t, I deliver to you your &s;hare of a country maimed and weakened; its trea&s;ure lavi&s;hed and mi&s;|&s;pent; its honours faded; and its conduct the laughing-&s;tock of Europe: our nation
<PB N="133" REF="132">in a manner without allies or friends, ex|cept &s;uch as we have hired to de&s;troy our fellow-&s;ubjects, and to ravage a country, in which we once claimed an invaluable &s;hare. I return to you &s;ome of your prin|cipal privileges impeached and mangled. And, la&s;tly, I leave you, as I conceive, at this hour and moment fully, effectually, and ab&s;olutely, under the di&s;cretion and power of a military force, which is to act without waiting for the authority of the ci|vil magi&s;trates.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some have been accu&s;ed of exaggerating the public misfortunes, nay, of having en|deavoured to help forward the mi&s;chief, that they might afterwards rai&s;e di&s;con|tents. I am willing to hope, that neither my temper, nor my &s;ituation in life, will be thought naturally to urge me to promote mi&s;ery, di&s;cord, or confu&s;ion, or to exult in the &s;ubver&s;ion of order, or in the ruin of property. I have no rea&s;on to contemplate with plea&s;ure the poverty of our country, the increa&s;e of our debts, and of our taxes; or the decay of our commerce.&mdash;Tru&s;t not, however, to my report: reflect, compare, and judge for your&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, under all the&s;e di&s;heartening cir|cum&s;tances, I could yet entertain a cheerful hope, and undertake again the commi&s;&s;ion with alacrity, as well as zeal, if I could &s;ee any effectual &s;teps taken to remove the ori|ginal cou&s;e of the mi&s;chief&mdash;'Then would there be a hope.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, till the Purity of the con&s;tituent
<PB N="134" REF="133">body, and thereby that of the repre&s;entative, be re&s;tored, there is NONE.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I gladly embrace this mo&s;t public opportuni|ty of delivering my &s;entiments, not only to all my con&s;tituents, but to tho&s;e likewi&s;e not my con&s;tituents, whom yet, in the large &s;en&s;e, I repre&s;ent, and am faithfully to &s;erve.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I look upon re&s;toring election and repre|&s;entation in &s;ome degree (for I expect no miracles) to their original purity, to be that, without which all other efforts will be vain and ridiculous.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If &s;omething be not done, you may, in|deed, retain the outward form of your con|&s;titution, but not the power thereof.</Q></P>
<P>Such were the words of that great good man, lo&s;t with tho&s;e of many others of his time, and his fame, as far as power could hurt it, put in the &s;hade along with them. The con&s;equences we have all &s;een and felt: America, from an obedient affectionate colony, became an independent nation; and two millions of people, nur&s;ed in the very lap of our monarchy, became the willing &s;ubjects of a republican con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in that great and calamitous con|flict Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine fought in the &s;ame field of rea&s;on together, but with very different &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Mr. Burke &s;poke to a parliament in England, &s;uch as Sir George Saville de&s;cribes it, that had no ears but for &s;ounds that flattered its corruptions. Mr. Paine, on the other hand, &s;poke TO A PEOPLE; rea&s;oned with them, that they were bound by no &s;ubjection to any &s;overeignty,
<PB N="135" REF="134">further than their own benefits connected them; and by the&s;e powerful arguments prepared the minds of the American people for that GLORIOUS, JUST, and HAPPY revolution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have a right to di&s;tingui&s;h it by that appellation, becau&s;e I aver that at this mo|ment there is as &s;acred a regard to property; as inviolable a &s;ecurity to all the rights of individuals; lower taxes; fewer grievances; le&s;s to deplore, and more to admire, in the con&s;titution of America, than that of any other country under heaven. I wi&s;h indeed to except our own, but I cannot even do that, till it &s;hall be purged of tho&s;e abu&s;es which, though they ob&s;cure and deform the &s;urface, have not as yet <HI>(thank God)</HI> de&s;troyed the vital parts.</P>
<P>Why then is Mr. Paine to be calumniated, and reviled, becau&s;e out of a people con&s;i&s;ting of near three millions, he alone did not remain attached in opinion to a monarchy. Remember, that all the blood which was &s;hed in America, and to which he was for years a melancholy and indignant wit|ne&s;s, was &s;hed by the authority of the crown of Great Britain, under the influence of its parliament, &s;uch as Sir George Saville has de&s;cribed it, and &s;uch as Mr. Burke him&s;elf will be called upon by and by in more glowing colours to paint it. How then can it be wondered at that Mr. Paine &s;hould return to this country in his heart a republican? Was he not equally republican when he wrote Common Sen&s;e? yet that volume has been &s;old without re&s;traint or pro&s;ecution in every &s;hop in England ever &s;ince, and which neverthele&s;s <HI>(I appeal to the book, which I have in court, and which is in every body's hands)</HI> contains every one prin|ciple of government, and every abu&s;e in the Bri|ti&s;h
<PB N="136" REF="135">con&s;titution, which is to be found in the Rights of Man. Yet Mr. Burke him&s;elf &s;aw no rea&s;on to be alarmed at its publication, nor to cry down its contents, even when America, which was &s;wayed by it, was in arms again&s;t the crown of Great-Britain. You &s;hall hear his opinion of it, in his letter to the &s;heriffs of Bri&s;tol, pages 33 and 34.</P>
<P><Q>The court gazette accompli&s;hed what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain. When that di&s;ingenuous compilation, and &s;trange medley of railing and flattery, was adduced, as a proof of the united &s;enti|ments of the people of Great-Britain, there was a great change throughout all America. The tide of popular affection, which had &s;till &s;et towards the parent country, began im|mediately to turn, and to flow with great ra|pidity in a contrary cour&s;e. Far from con|cealing the&s;e wild declarations of enmity, <HI>the author of the celebrated pamphlet which pre|pared the minds of the people for indepen|dence,</HI> in&s;i&s;ts largely on the multitude and the &s;pirit of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es; and draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he &s;uppo&s;es) mu&s;t be irre&s;i&s;tible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of govern|ment &s;o partial to authority, as not to allow, that the ho&s;tile mind of the rulers to their people, did fully ju&s;tify a change of govern|ment; nor can any rea&s;on whatever be given, why one people &s;hould voluntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a &s;uppo&s;ition of great affection and benevo|lence towards them. Unfortunately your
<PB N="137" REF="136">rulers, tru&s;ting to other things, took no notice of this great principle of con|nexion.</Q></P>
<P>But there is a time, it &s;eems, for all things.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the con&s;equences of this mighty revolution are too notorious to require illu&s;tra|tion. No audience would &s;it to hear (what eve|ry body has &s;een and felt,) the independence of America notoriou&s;ly produced, not by remote and circuitous effect, but directly and palpably, the revolutions which now agitate Europe, and which portend &s;uch new changes over the face of the earth. Let governors take warning. The revo|lution in France was the con&s;equence of her in|curably corrupt and profligate government. God forbid that I &s;hould be thought to lean, by this declaration, upon her unfortunate monarch, bending, perhaps at this moment, under afflic|tions which my heart &s;inks within me to think of; but, when I &s;peak with dete&s;tation of the former politics of the French court, I fa&s;ten as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince, as I impute to our gracious &s;overeign the corruptions of our own government. I de&s;ire, indeed, in the di&s;tincte&s;t manner, to be under|&s;tood that I mean to &s;peak of his Maje&s;ty, not only with that obedience and duty which I owe to him as a &s;ubject, but with that ju&s;tice which I think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in public or private life.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Mr. Paine happened to be in England when the French revolution took place
<PB N="138" REF="137">and notwith&s;tanding what he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed and allowed from his hi&s;tory to have felt upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, he remained wholly &s;ilent and inactive. The people of this country too appear|ed to be indifferent &s;pectators of the animating &s;cene. They &s;aw, without vi&s;ible emotion, de&s;|poti&s;m de&s;troyed, and the King of France, by his own con&s;ent, become the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of a free people. Certainly, at lea&s;t, it produced none of tho&s;e effects which are &s;o deprecated by government at pre&s;ent; nor, mo&s;t probably, ever would, if it had not occurred to the celebrated per&s;on, who&s;e name I mu&s;t &s;o often mention, voluntarily to provoke the &s;ubject; a &s;ubject which, if dangerous to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he &s;hould not have led to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: for, &s;urely, it is not to be endured, that any private man is to publi&s;h a creed for a whole nation; to tell us that we are not to think for our&s;elves&mdash;to impo&s;e his own fetters upon the human mind&mdash;to dog|mati&s;e at di&s;cretion&mdash;and that no man &s;hall &s;it down to an&s;wer him without being guilty of a libel. I a&s;&s;ert, that if it be a libel to mi&s;take our con&s;titution&mdash;to &s;upport it by means that tend to de&s;troy it&mdash;and to choo&s;e the mo&s;t danger|ous &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;on for the interference, Mr. Burke is that libeller; but not therefore the object of a crimi|nal pro&s;ecution: for, whil&s;t I am defending the motives of one man, I have neither right nor di&s;|po&s;ition to criminate the motives of another. All I contend for, is a fact that cannot be contro|verted, viz. that this officious interference was the origin of Mr. Paine's book. I put my cau&s;e upon its being the origin of it&mdash;the avowed origin
<PB N="139" REF="138">&mdash;as will abundantly appear from the introduc|tion and preface to both parts, and throughout the whole body of the work; nay, from the very work of Mr. Burke him&s;elf, to which both of them are an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, for the hi&s;tory of that celebrated work, I appeal to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the French revolution had arrived at &s;ome of its early &s;tages, a few, and but a few, per&s;ons (not to be named when compared with the nation) took a vi&s;ible intere&s;t in the&s;e mighty events; an intere&s;t well worthy of Engli&s;hmen. They &s;aw a pernicious &s;y&s;tem of government, which had led to cruel de&s;olating wars, and had been for ages the &s;courge of Great Britain, giving way to a &s;y&s;tem which &s;eemed to promi&s;e har|mony and peace among&s;t the nations. They &s;aw this with virtuous and peaceable &s;atisfaction: And a reverend divine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Price.</NOTE>, eminent for his elo|quence, recollecting that the i&s;&s;ues of life are in the hands of God, &s;aw no profanene&s;s in mix|ing the &s;ubject with public thank&s;giving; re|minding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages. It happened, al&s;o, that a &s;ociety of gentlemen, France being then a neutral nation, and her own monarch &s;wearing almo&s;t daily upon her altars to maintain the new con&s;titution, thought they infringed no law by &s;ending a general congratulation. Their numbers, indeed, were very incon&s;iderable; &s;o much &s;o, that Mr. Burke, with more truth than
<PB N="140" REF="139">wi&s;dom, begins his volume with a &s;arca&s;m upon their in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P><Q>Until very lately he had never heard of &s;uch a club. It certainly never occu|pied a moment of his thoughts; nor, he believed, tho&s;e of any per&s;on out of their own &s;et.</Q></P>
<P>Why then make their proceedings the &s;ub|ject of alarm throughout England? &mdash; There had been no pro&s;ecution again&s;t them, nor any charge founded upon &s;u&s;picion of di&s;affection again&s;t any of their body. But Mr. Burke thought it was re&s;erved for his eloquence to whip the&s;e curs of faction to their kennels. How he has &s;ucceeded, I appeal to all that has happened &s;ince the introduction of his &s;chi&s;m in the Briti&s;h empire, by giving to the King, who&s;e title was que&s;tioned by no man, a title which it is his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t &s;olemn intere&s;t to di&s;claim.</P>
<P>After having, in his fir&s;t work, la&s;hed Dr. Price in a &s;train of eloquent irony for con&s;idering the monarchy to be elective, which he could not but know Dr. Price, in the literal &s;en&s;e of elec|tion, neither did or could po&s;&s;ibly con&s;ider it, Mr. Burke publi&s;hed a &s;econd treati&s;e; in which, after reprinting many pa&s;&s;ages from Mr. Paine's former work, he ridicules and denies the &s;up|po&s;ed right of the people to change their govern|ments, in the following words:</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="140">"The French revolution, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI>" (&s;peak|ing of the Engli&s;h &s;ocieties) <Q>was the act of the majority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, <HI>the people of England, for in&s;tance,</HI> wi&s;h to make the &s;ame change, they have the &s;ame right; ju&s;t the &s;ame undoubtedly; that is, none at all.</Q></P>
<P>And then, after &s;peaking of the &s;ub&s;erviency of will to duty, (in which I agree with him,) he, in a &s;ub&s;tantive &s;entence, maintains the &s;ame doctrine; thus:</P>
<P><Q>The con&s;titution of a country being once &s;ettled upon &s;ome compact, tacit or expre&s;&s;|ed, there is no power exi&s;ting of force to alter it, without the breach of the covenant, or the con&s;ent of all the parties. Such is the nature of a contract.</Q></P>
<P>So that if rea&s;on, or even revelation it&s;elf, were now to demon&s;trate to us, that our con&s;titution was mi&s;chievous in its effects; that, to u&s;e Mr. At|torney General's expre&s;&s;ion, we had been in&s;ane for the many centuries we have &s;upported it; yet that &s;till, if the King had not forfeited his title to the crown, nor the Lords their privileges, the univer&s;al voice of the whole people of Eng|land could not build up a new government upon a legitimate ba&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="141">Gentlemen, not to argue for the pre&s;ent again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;ition, and &s;uppo&s;ing it could, be|yond all controver&s;y, be maintained; for hea|ven's &s;ake, let wi&s;dom never utter it! Let policy and prudence for ever conceal it! If you &s;eek the &s;tability of the Engli&s;h government, rather put the book of Mr. Paine, which calls it bad, into every hand in the kingdom, than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even again&s;t that which is the be&s;t.&mdash;Say to the people of England, Look at your con&s;titution, there it lies before you&mdash;the work of your pious fathers, handed down as a &s;acred depo&s;it from generation to generation, the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom and virtue, and its parts ce|mented together with kindred blood. There are, indeed, a few &s;pots upon its &s;urface; but the &s;ame principle which reared the &s;tructure will bru&s;h them all away: you may keep it, or you may de&s;troy it.&mdash;To &s;uch an addre&s;s, what would be the an&s;wer? A chorus of the nation&mdash; YES, WE WILL PRESERVE IT. But &s;ay to the &s;ame nation, even of the very &s;ame con&s;titution, It is yours, &s;uch as it is, for better or for wor&s;e; it is &s;trapped upon your backs, to carry it as bea&s;ts of burthen, and you have no juri&s;diction to ca&s;t it off. Let this be your po&s;ition, and you in&s;tantly rai&s;e up (I appeal to every man's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own nature) a &s;pirit of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;con|tent. Yet it is the controver&s;y alone, which this u&s;ele&s;s and mi&s;chievous propo&s;ition &s;tirred up, that has pointed mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ages arraigned before you, which it will be pre&s;ently my duty to explain.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="142">But let the prudence of the argument be what it may, the argument it&s;elf is untenable.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne. No man can be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the teeth of fact, to have contended it; but did not the people of England elect King William, and break the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? and does not his Maje&s;ty's title grow out of that election? It is one of the charges again&s;t the defendant, his having denied the parliament which called the Prince of Orange to the throne to have been a legal convention of the whole people; and is not the very foundation of that charge, that it was &s;uch a legal convention, and that it was intended to be &s;o? and if it was &s;o, did not the people then confer the crown upon King William with|out any regard to hereditary right? Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales, who &s;tood directly in the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who had incurred no per&s;onal forfeiture? Did they not give their deliverer an e&s;tate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or hi&s;tory of the coun|try? And, la&s;tly, might they not, by the &s;ame authority, have given the royal inheritance to the family of a &s;tranger? Mr. Ju&s;tice Black&s;tone, in his Commentaries, in terms, a&s;&s;erts that they might; and a&s;cribes their choice of King William, and the &s;ub&s;equent limitations of the crown, not to want of juri&s;diction, but to their true origin, to prudence and di&s;cretion in not di&s;turbing a valuable in&s;titution further than public &s;afety and nece&s;&s;ity dictated.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h government &s;tands then on this public con&s;ent, the true root of all governments.
<PB N="144" REF="143">And I agree with Mr. Burke, that, while it is well admini&s;tered, it is not in the power of fac|tions or libels to di&s;turb it; though, when mini&s;|ters are in fault, they are &s;ure to &s;et down all di&s;turbances to the&s;e cau&s;es. This is mo&s;t ju&s;tly and eloquently exemplified in the Thoughts on the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents, page 5 and 6.</P>
<P><Q>Mini&s;ters contend that no adequate pro|vocation has been given for &s;o &s;preading a di&s;content, our affairs having been conduct|ed throughout with remarkable temper and con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The wicked indu&s;|try of &s;ome libellers, joined to the in|trigues of a few di&s;appointed politic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans, have, in their opinion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the na|tion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing, indeed, can be more unnatural than the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions of this country, if the above account be a true one. I con|fe&s;s I &s;hall a&s;&s;ent to it with great reluctance, and only on the compul&s;ion of the cleare&s;t and firme&s;t proofs; becau&s;e their account re&s;olves it&s;elf into this &s;hort but di&s;courag|ing propo&s;ition. 'That we have a very good mini&s;try, but that we are a very bad people; that we &s;et our&s;elves to bite the hand that feeds us; and, with a malignant in&s;anity, oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures, and ungratefully vilify the per&s;ons of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ole object is our own peace and pro&s;perity. If a few puny
<PB N="145" REF="144">libellers, acting under a knot of factious po|liticians, without virtue, parts, or character (for &s;uch they are con&s;tantly repre&s;ented by the&s;e gentlemen), are &s;ufficient to excite this di&s;turbance, very perver&s;e mu&s;t be the di&s;po&s;ition of that people, among&s;t whom &s;uch a di&s;turbance can be excited by &s;uch means.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;ays true: never were &s;erious di&s;turbances excited by &s;uch means!</P>
<P>But to return to the argument.&mdash;Let us now &s;ee how the rights of the people &s;tand upon au|thority, and whether this great &s;ource of govern|ment is not maintained by per&s;ons on whom my friend will find it hard to fa&s;ten the character of libellers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the mo&s;t modern author on the &s;ubject of government&mdash;a gentleman, who&s;e work lies &s;pread out before me, as it often does for my delight and in&s;truction in my lei&s;ure hours. I have al&s;o, by the favour of a friend who &s;its near me in court, the honour of his per&s;onal acquaintance. He is a man, perhaps more than any other, devoted to the real con&s;ti|tution of the country, as will be found through|out his valuable work; and he is a per&s;on, be|&s;ides, of great learning, which enabled him to in|fu&s;e much u&s;eful knowledge into my learned friend who introduced me to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Law, King's Coun&s;el.</NOTE> I &s;peak of Mr. Paley, Archdeacon of Carli&s;le, and of his work, entitled, The Principles of Political and Moral Philo&s;ophy, in which he inve&s;tigates the
<PB N="146" REF="145">fir&s;t principles of all governments &mdash; a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion not thought dangerous till lately: and I hope we &s;hall &s;oon get rid of this ridiculous panic.</P>
<P>Mr. Paley profe&s;&s;es to think of governments what the Chri&s;tian religion was thought of by its fir&s;t teachers:&mdash;'If it be of God it will &s;tand;' and he puts the duties of obedience to them up|on free will and moral duty. After di&s;&s;enting from Mr. Locke as to the origin of governments in compact, he &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle, and dangerous in the application, we a&s;&s;ign for the only ground of the &s;ubjects' obligation, THE WILL OF GOD, AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;teps by which the argument pro|ceeds are few and direct &mdash; 'It is the will of God that the happine&s;s of human life be promoted:'&mdash;this is the fir&s;t &s;tep, and the foundation, not only of this, but of every moral conclu&s;ion. 'Civil &s;ociety conduces to that end:'&mdash;this is the &s;econd propo&s;ition. 'Civil &s;ocieties cannot be up|held, unle&s;s in each, the intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety be binding upon every part and member of it:'&mdash;this is the third &s;tep, and conducts us to the conclu&s;ion, namely,&mdash; 'That, &s;o long as the intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety requires it (that is, &s;o long as the e&s;tabli&s;hed government cannot be re&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="147" REF="146">or changed without public inconveniency) it is the will of God (which will univer&s;ally determines our duty) that the e&s;tabli&s;hed government be obeyed,'&mdash;<HI>and no longer.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>But who &s;hall judge of this? We an&s;wer, <HI>'Every man for him&s;elf.'</HI> In con|tentions between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject, the parties acknowledge no com|mon arbitrator; and it would be ab&s;urd to commit the deci&s;ion to tho&s;e who&s;e con|duct has provoked the que&s;tion, and who&s;e own intere&s;t, authority, and fate, are immediately concerned in it. The danger of error and abu&s;e is no objec|tion to the rule of expediency, becau&s;e every other rule is liable to the &s;ame or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon the &s;ubject (like all rules which appeal to, or bind the con&s;cience) mu&s;t, in the application, depend upon private judgment. It may be ob&s;erved, however, that it ought equally to be ac|counted the exerci&s;e of a man's private judgment, whether he determines by rea|&s;onings and conclu&s;ions of his own, or &s;ubmits to be directed by the advice of others, provided he be free to choo&s;e his guide.</Q></P>

<P><Q>No u&s;age, law, or authority whatever, is

The family of the prince&mdash;the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion&mdash;the pre|rogative of the crown&mdash;the form and parts of the legi&s;lature&mdash;together with the re&s;pec|tive powers, office, duration, and mutual dependency of the &s;everal parts; are all only &s;o many laws, mutable, like other laws, whenever expediency requires, either by the ordinary act of the legi&s;lature, or, if the oc|ca&s;ion de&s;erve it, BY THE INTERPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE.</Q></P>
<P>No man can &s;ay that Mr. Paley intended to dif|fu&s;e di&s;content by this declaration. He mu&s;t there|fore be taken to think with me, that freedom and affection, and the &s;en&s;e of advantages, are the be&s;t and the only &s;upports of government. On the &s;ame principle, he then goes on to &s;ay,&mdash; <Q>The&s;e points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe; they are repre&s;ented to the mind as principles of the con&s;titution, &s;ettled by our ance&s;tors, and being &s;ettled, to be no more committed to innovation or debate; as foun|dations never to be &s;tirred; as the terms and conditions of the &s;ocial compact, to which every citizen of the &s;tate has engaged his fide|lity, by virtue of a promi&s;e which he cannot now recall. Such rea&s;ons have no place in our &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P>Such are the &s;entiments of this excellent author, and there is no part of Mr. Paine's work, from the one end of it to the other, that advances any other propo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="148">But the Attorney General will &s;ay, the&s;e are the grave &s;peculative opinions of a friend to the Engli&s;h Government, whereas Mr. Paine is its profe&s;&s;ed enemy; what then? the princi|ple is, that every man, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le he obeys the laws, is to think for him&s;elf, and to conduct him&s;elf as he thinks. The very ends of &s;ociety exact this licence, and the policy of the law, in its provi&s;ions for its &s;ecurity, has tacitly &s;anctioned it. The real fact is, that writings again&s;t a free and well-proportioned Govern|ment, need not be guarded again&s;t by laws. They cannot often exi&s;t, and never with effect. The ju&s;t and aweful principles of &s;ociety, are rarely brought forward, but when they are in&s;ulted and denied, or abu&s;ed in practice: Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on Government, we owe to Sir Robert Filmer, as we owe Mr. Paine's to Mr. Burke; and indeed, between the arguments of Filmer and Burke, I &s;ee no e&s;&s;ential difference; &s;ince it is not worth di&s;puting, whether a King exi&s;ts by <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine</HI> right, or indi&s;&s;oluble <HI>Human</HI> compact, if he exi&s;ts whether we will or no: If his exi&s;tence be without our con&s;ent, and to continue without benefit, it matters not a farthing, whether his title be from God or from Man.</P>

Filmer and his adherents,) <Q><HI>are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a &s;ubject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the perpe|tual
<PB N="150" REF="149">tie of &s;ubjection and allegiance.</HI> It is plain, mankind never owned nor con&s;idered any &s;uch natural <HI>&s;ubjection that they were born in,</HI> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own con&s;ents, to a &s;ubjection to them and their heirs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is true, that whatever engagements or promi&s;es any one has made for him&s;elf, he is under the obligation of them, but can|not, by any compact what&s;oever, bind his children or po&s;terity: for his &s;on, when a man, being altogether as free as the father, any <HI>act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the &s;on,</HI> than it can of any body el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>So much for Mr. Locke's opinion of the rights of mankind. Let us now examine his ideas of the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of tru&s;ting them with them.</P>
<P><Q>Perhaps it will be &s;aid, that the people being ignorant, and always di&s;contented, to lay the foundation of government in the un|&s;teady opinion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expo&s;e it to certain ruin: and no government will be able long to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if the people may &s;et up a new legi&s;lature, whenever they take offence at the old one. To this, I an&s;wer quite the contrary: people are not &s;o ea&s;ily got out of their old forms, as &s;ome are apt to &s;ugge&s;t: they are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknow|ledged faults in the frame they have been accu&s;tomed to; and if there be any origi|nal defects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or corruption, it is not an ea&s;y thing
<PB N="151" REF="150">to be changed, even when all the world &s;ees there is an opportunity for it. This &s;low|ne&s;s and aver&s;ion in the people to quit their old con&s;titutions, has in the many revolu|tions which have been &s;een in this kingdom, in this and former ages, &s;till kept us to, or, af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er &s;ome interval of fruitle&s;s attempts, &s;till brought us back again to our old legi&s;lative of king, lords and commons: and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from &s;ome of our princes heads, they never carried the people &s;o far as to place it in another line.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I wi&s;h I had &s;trength to go on with all that is material, but I have read enough, not only to maintain the true princi|ples of government, but to put to &s;hame the narrow &s;y&s;tem of di&s;tru&s;ting the people.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that Mr. Locke went great lengths in his po&s;itions, to beat down the con|trary doctrine of divine right, which was then endangering the new e&s;tabli&s;hment. But that cannot be objected to David Hume, who main|tains the &s;ame doctrine; &s;peaking of the Magna Charta in his hi&s;tory, vol. ii. page 88, he &s;ays, <Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the former ar|ticles of the great charter, contain &s;uch miti|gations and explanations of the feodal law, as are rea&s;onable and equitable; and that the lat|ter involve all the chief outlines of a legal Government, and provide for the equal di&s;tri|bution of ju&s;tice and free enjoyment of pro|perty; the great object for which political &s;ociety was founded by men, <HI>which the peo|ple have a perpetual and unalienable right to
<PB N="152" REF="151">recall;</HI> and which no time, nor precedent, nor &s;tatute, nor po&s;itive in&s;titution, ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermo&s;t in their thoughts and attention.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e authorities are &s;ufficient to re&s;t on, yet I cannot omit Mr. Burke him&s;elf, who is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more di&s;tinct on the &s;ubject. Speaking not of the ancient people of Eng|land, but of Colonies planted almo&s;t within our memories, he &s;ays, <Q>If there be one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this; That the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of Ame|rica is wholly aver&s;e to any other than a free Government" and this is indication enough to any hone&s;t &s;tate&s;man, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their ca&s;e. If any a&s;k me what a free Government is, I an&s;wer, THAT IT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK SO; AND THAT THEY, AND NOT I, ARE THE NATURAL, LAWFUL, AND COMPETENT JUDGES OF THIS MATTER. If they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is con&s;i&s;tent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for &s;o great a tru&s;t, and not to endeavour to prove from thence, that they have rea&s;oned ami&s;s, and that having gone &s;o far, by analogy, they mu&s;t here-after have no enjoyment but by my plea&s;ure.</Q></P>

<P>Gentlemen, I have in&s;i&s;ted, at great length, upon the origin of Government being in the con&s;ent of the people, and detailed the autho|rities which you have heard upon the &s;ubject, becau&s;e I con&s;ider it to be not only a &s;upport, but, indeed, the only foundation of the Li|berty of the Pre&s;s. If Mr. Burke be right in HIS principles of Government, I admit that the Pre&s;s, in my &s;en&s;e of its freedom, ought not to be free, <HI>nor free in any &s;en&s;e at all;</HI> and that all Addre&s;&s;es to the people upon the &s;ub|ject of Government; and all &s;peculations of amendment, of what kind or nature &s;oever, are illegal and criminal:&mdash;For, if the people have, without po&s;&s;ible recall, delegated all their authorities, they have no juri&s;diction to act, and therefore none to think, upon &s;uch &s;ub|jects; and it is a libel to arraign Government or any of its acts, before tho&s;e that have no juri&s;diction to correct them. But on the other hand, as it is a &s;ettled rule in the Law of
<PB N="155" REF="154">England, that the &s;ubject may always addre&s;s a competent juri&s;diction on every matter with|in it, no legal argument can &s;hake the free|dom of the Pre&s;s in my &s;en&s;e of it, if I am &s;upported in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people, to change or to reform their Governments.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is becau&s;e the Liberty of the Pre&s;s re&s;olves it&s;elf into this great i&s;&s;ue, that it has been in every time and country, the la&s;t liberty which &s;ubjects have been able to wre&s;t from power.&mdash;Other liberties are held under Governments, but the liberty of opinion keeps Governments them&s;elves in due &s;ubjection to their duties. This has produced the martyr|dom of truth in every age, and the world has only purged it&s;elf from ignorance with the innocent blood of tho&s;e who have enlighten|ed it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my &s;trength and time are wa&s;t|ed, and I can only make this melancholy hi&s;tory pa&s;s like a &s;hadow before you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the grand type and ex|ample.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al God of Nature,&mdash;the Saviour of Mankind,&mdash;the Fountain of all Light, who came to pluck the world from eternal dark|ne&s;s, expired upon a cro&s;s the &s;coff of infidel &s;corn; and his ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles followed him in the train of Martyrs. When he came in the fle&s;h, he might have come like the Ma|hometan Prophet, as a powerful Sovereign, and propagated that religion with an uncon|querable &s;word, which even now, after the lap&s;e of ages, is but &s;lowly moving, under the
<PB N="156" REF="155">influence of rea&s;on, over the face of the earth: But &s;uch a proce&s;s would have been incon|&s;i&s;tent with his mi&s;&s;ion, which was to con|found the pride, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the univer&s;al rights of men; he came therefore in that low|ly &s;tate which is repre&s;ented in the Go&s;pel, and preached his con&s;olations to the poor.</P>
<P>When the foundation of this religion was di&s;covered to be invulnerable and immortal, we find political power taking the church into partner&s;hip; thus began the corruptions both of Religion and Civil Power, and, hand in hand together, what havoc have they not made in the world; ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing by ignorance and the per&s;ecution of truth; but this very per&s;ecu|tion only ha&s;tened the revival of letters and liberty, which was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;troy the one and to rai&s;e up the other. Nay, you will find, that in the exact proportion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered, they have de&s;troyed the Governments that bound them. The Court of Star-Chamber, the fir&s;t re&s;triction on the Pre&s;s of England, was erected in 1637. From that moment no man could legally write without an Imprima|tur from the State; but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through &s;ecret channels, and the unhappy Charles, unwarned by a free pre&s;s, was brought in ele|ven years afterwards to an ignominious death.</P>
<P>When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their &s;ufferings, real or imagi|nary, their pa&s;&s;ions &s;pend them&s;elves in air, like gun-powder &s;cattered upon the &s;urface; but pent up by terrors, they work un&s;een like
<PB N="157" REF="156">&s;ubter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aneous fire, bur&s;t forth in earthquake, and de&s;troy every thing in their cour&s;e. Let rea&s;on be oppo&s;ed to rea&s;on, and argument to argument, and every good Government will be &s;afe.</P>
<P>The U&s;urper, Cromwell, pur&s;ued the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of re&s;traint in &s;upport of his Govern|ment, and the end of it &s;peedily followed.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration of Charles the Second, the Star-Chamber Ordinance of 1637, was worked up into an Act of Parliament, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollowed up during that reign, and the &s;hort one that followed it, by the mo&s;t &s;an|guinary pro&s;ecutions; but what fact in hi&s;|tory is more notorious, than that this blind and contemptible policy prepared and ha&s;tened on the Revolution. At that great aera the&s;e cob|webs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere all bru&s;hed away: The freedom of the Pre&s;s was regenerated, and the Country, ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by its affections, has &s;ince enjoyed a century of tranquillity and glory.&mdash;Thus I have maintained, by Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, that in proportion as the Pre&s;s has been free, Engli&s;h Government has been &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now &s;upport the &s;ame important truth by very great authorities. Upon a &s;ubject of this kind re&s;ort cannot be had to Law Ca&s;es. The ancient Law of Eng|land knew nothing of &s;uch Libels; they be|gan, and &s;hould have ended, with the Star-Chamber. What writings are &s;landerous of individuals, mu&s;t be looked for where the&s;e pro&s;ecutions are recorded; but upon general &s;ubjects we mu&s;t go to general writers. If, indeed, I were to refer to ob&s;cure authors, I
<PB N="158" REF="157">might be an&s;wered, that my very authorities were Libels, in&s;tead of ju&s;tifications or ex|amples; but this cannot be &s;aid with effect of great men, who&s;e works are cla&s;&s;ics in our language, taught in our &s;chools, and printed under the eye of Government.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hall begin with the Poet Milton, a great authority in all learning.&mdash; It may be &s;aid, indeed, he was a Republican, but that would only prove that Republicani&s;m is not incompatible with virtue; it may be &s;aid too, that the work which I cite was written again&s;t previous Licen&s;ing, which is not contended for to-day. But, in my opi|nion, if every work is to be adjudged a libel, which is adver&s;e to the wi&s;hes of Govern|ment, or to the opinions of tho&s;e who may try it, the revival of a Licencer would be a &s;ecurity to the public: For, if I pre&s;ent my book to a Magi&s;trate appointed by law, if he rejects it, I have only to forbear from the publication, and in the forbearance I am &s;afe; and he too is an&s;werable to Law for the abu&s;e of his authority. But, upon the argument of to-day, a man mu&s;t print at his peril, without any guide to the principles of judgment, upon which his work may be afterwards po&s;ecuted and condemned. Milton's argument therefore applies, and was meant to apply, to every in|terruption to writing, which, while they op|pre&s;s the individual, endanger the State.</P>
<P><Q>We have them not,</Q> &s;ays Milton, <Q>that can be heard of, from any ancient &s;tate, or polity, or church, nor by any &s;tatute left us by our ance&s;tors, elder or later, nor from the
<PB N="159" REF="158">modern cu&s;tom of any reformed city, or church abroad; but from the mo&s;t antichri&s;|tian council, and the mo&s;t tyrannous inqui&s;i|tion that ever exi&s;ted. Till then, books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; <HI>the i&s;&s;ue of the brain was no more &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed than the i&s;&s;ue of the womb.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>To the pure all things are pure; not only meats and drinks, but all kind of knowledge whether good or evil; the knowledge cannot defile, nor con&s;equently the books, if the will and con&s;cience be not defiled.</P>
<P>Bad books &s;erve in many re&s;pects to di&s;|cover, to confute, to forewarn and to illu&s;|trate. Whereof, what better witne&s;s can we expect I &s;hould produce, than one of your own, now &s;itting in parliament, the chief of learned men reputed in this land, <HI>Mr. Selden;</HI> who&s;e volume of natural and national laws, proves, not only by great authorities brought together, but by exqui&s;ite rea&s;ons and theorems almo&s;t mathematica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly demon|&s;trative, that all opinions, yea errors, known, read and collated, are of main &s;ervice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance toward the &s;peedy attainment of what is true&s;t.</P>
<P>Opinions and under&s;tanding are not &s;uch wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and &s;tatutes, and &s;tandards. We mu&s;t not think to make a &s;taple commodity of all the knowledge in the land, to mark and licence it like our broad cloth and our woolpacks.</P>
<P>Nor is it to the common people le&s;s than a reproach; for if we be &s;o jealous over them
<PB N="160" REF="159">that we cannot tru&s;t them with an Engli&s;h pamphlet, what do we but cen&s;ure them, for a giddy, vicious, and ungrounded people; in &s;uch a &s;ick and weak e&s;tate of faith and di&s;cretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a Licen&s;er. That this is care or love of them we cannot pre|tend.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e corruptions which it &s;eeks to pre|vent, break in fa&s;ter at doors which cannot be &s;hut.</P>
<P>To prevent men thinking and acting for them&s;elves, by re&s;traints on the pre&s;s, is like to the exploits of that gallant man, who, thought to pound up the crows by &s;hutting his park gate.</P>
<P>This ob&s;tructing violence meets for the mo&s;t part with an event, utterly oppo&s;ite to the end which it drives at: in&s;tead of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing books, it rai&s;es them and inve&s;ts them with a reputation: the puni&s;hment of wits enhances their authority, &s;aith the Vi&s;|count St. Albans'; and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain &s;park of truth, that flies up in the face of them who &s;eek to tread it out.</P></Q>
<P>He then adverts to his vi&s;it to the famous Ga|lileo, whom he found and vi&s;ited in the inqui&s;i|tion, <Q>for not thinking in A&s;tronomy with the Franci&s;can and Dominican Monks.</Q> And what event ought more deeply to intere&s;t and affect us. The very laws of Nature were to bend under the rod of a Licen&s;er; this illu&s;tri|ous A&s;tronomer ended his life within the bars of a pri&s;on, becau&s;e, in &s;eeing the pha&s;es of Ve|nus through his newly-invented tele&s;cope, he
<PB N="161" REF="160">pronounced, that &s;he &s;hone with borrowed light, and from the Sun as the centre of the uni|ver&s;e. This was the mighty crime, the pla|cing the Sun in the center: that Sun which now inhabits it upon the foundation of mathe|matical truth, which enables us to traver&s;e the pathle&s;s ocean, and to carry our line and rule among&s;t other worlds, which but for Galileo we had never known, perhaps even to the re|ce&s;&s;es of an Infinite and Immortal God.</P>
<P>Milton then, in his mo&s;t eloquent addre&s;s to the parliament, puts the liberty of the pre&s;s on its true and mo&s;t honourable foundation. <Q>Believe it, Lords and Commons, they who coun&s;el ye to &s;uch a &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of books, do as good as bid you &s;uppre&s;s your&s;elves; and I will &s;oon &s;hew how.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it be de&s;ired to know the immediate cau&s;e of all this free writing and free &s;peak|ing, there cannot be a&s;&s;igned a truer than your own mild, and free, and humane Govern|ment; it is the liberty, Lords and Com|mons, which your own valorous and happy coun&s;els have purcha&s;ed us; liberty which is the nur&s;e of all great wits: this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our &s;pirits like the influence of heaven; this is that which hath enfranchi&s;ed, enlarged and lifted up our apprehen&s;ions, degrees above them&s;elves. Ye cannot make us now le&s;s ca|pable, le&s;s knowing, le&s;s eagerly pur&s;uing the truth, unle&s;s ye fir&s;t make your&s;elves, that made us &s;o, le&s;s the lovers, le&s;s the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ig|norant again, bruti&s;h formal and &s;lavi&s;h, as ye
<PB N="162" REF="161">found us; but you then mu&s;t fir&s;t become that which ye cannot be, oppre&s;&s;ive, arbitra|ry and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye have freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erected to the &s;earch and expectation of great|e&s;t and exacte&s;t things, is the i&s;&s;ue of your own virtue propagated in us. Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to con&s;cience, above all liberties.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now refer you to another Author, who&s;e opinion you may think more in point, as having lived in our own times, and as holding the highe&s;t monarchical prin|ciples of Government. I &s;peak of Mr. Hume, who, neverthele&s;s, con&s;iders, that this Liberty of the Pre&s;s extends not only to ab&s;tract &s;pe|culation, but to keep the public on their guard again&s;t all the acts of their Government.</P>
<P>After &s;hewing the advantages of a Monarchy to public freedom, provided it is duly con|trolled and watched by the popular part of the Con&s;titution, he &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e principles account for the great liberty of the pre&s;s in the&s;e kingdoms, beyond what is indulged in any other Government. It is apprehend|ed, that arbitrary power would &s;teal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its pro|gre&s;s, and were there not an ea&s;y method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other. <HI>The &s;pirit of the people m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t frequently be rou&s;ed, in order to curb the ambition of the Court;</HI> and the dread of rou&s;ing this &s;pirit mu&s;t be employ|ed to prevent that ambition. Nothing is &s;o
<PB N="163" REF="162">effectual to this purpo&s;e as the liberty of the pre&s;s, by which all the learning, wit, and genius of the nation, may be employed on the &s;ide of freedom; and every one be ani|mated to its defence. <HI>As long, therefore, as the republican part of our Government can maintain it&s;elf again&s;t the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the pre&s;s open, as of importance to its own pre&s;ervation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There is another authority co-temporary with the la&s;t, a &s;plendid Speaker in the upper Hou&s;e of Parliament, and who held during mo&s;t of his time high offices under the King; I &s;peak of the Earl of Che&s;terfield, who thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of Lords:&mdash; <Q>One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, my Lords, we enjoy, is Liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil&mdash;Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of Liberty, it is &mdash;.</Q></P>

<P>Doctor John&s;on claims to pluck that feather f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om Lord Che&s;terfield's wing; he &s;peaks, I believe, of the eye of the political body.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Er&s;kine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, I have heard it &s;aid, that Lord Che&s;terfield borrowed that which I was ju&s;t about to &s;tate, and which his Lord&s;hip has anticipated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Kenyon.</SPEAKER>
<P>That very &s;peech which did Lord Che&s;terfield &s;o much honour, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written by Doctor John&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Er&s;kine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, I believe it was &s;o, and I am much obliged to his Lord&s;hip for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine. For though Lord Che&s;terfield was a
<PB N="164" REF="163">man of great ingenuity and wit, he was un|doubtedly far inferior in learning and in mo|narchical opinion, to the celebrated writer to whom my Lord has now delivered the work by his authority. Doctor John&s;on then &s;ays, <Q>One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a people, my Lords, can enjoy, is Liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil: licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of liberty: it is an ebullition, an ex|cre&s;cence; it is a &s;peck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle, with a trembling hand, le&s;t I de&s;troy the body, le&s;t I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is &s;uch a connection between licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, that it is not ea&s;y to correct the one, without dangerou&s;ly wound|ing the other; it is extremely hard to di&s;|tingui&s;h the true limit between them: like a changeable &s;ilk, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee there are two different colours, but we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover where the one ends, or where the other begins.</Q></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I cannot help agreeing with this learned author. The danger of touching the pre&s;s is the difficulty of marking its limits. My learned friend, who has ju&s;t gone out of Court, has drawn no line, and unfolded no principle. He has not told us, if this book is condemned, what book may be written. If I may not write again&s;t the exi&s;tence of a mo|narchy, and recommend a republic, may I write again&s;t any part of tie Government? May I &s;ay that we &s;hould be better without a
<PB N="165" REF="164">Hou&s;e of Lords, or a Hou&s;e of Commons, or a Court of Chancery, or any other given part of our e&s;tabli&s;hment? Or if, as has been hinted, a work may become libellous for &s;tat|ing even legal matter with &s;arca&s;tic phra&s;e, the difficulty becomes the greater, and the li|berty of the pre&s;s more impo&s;&s;ible to define.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author, pur&s;uing the &s;ubject and &s;peaking of the fall of Roman liberty, &s;ays, <Q>But this fort of liberty came &s;oon after to be called licentiou&s;ne&s;s; for we are told that Augu&s;tus, after having e&s;tabli&s;hed his empire, re&s;tored order in Rome by re&s;training licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s. God forbid we &s;hould in this country have order re&s;tored, or licentiou&s;ne&s;s re&s;trained, at &s;o dear a rate as the people of Rome paid for it to Augu&s;tus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let us con&s;ider, my Lords, that arbitrary power has &s;eldom or never been introduced into any country at once. It mu&s;t be in|troduced by &s;low degrees, and as it were &s;tep by &s;tep, le&s;t the people &s;hould &s;ee its approach. The barriers and fences of the people's liberty mu&s;t be plucked up one by one, and &s;ome plau&s;ible pretences mu&s;t be &s;ound for removing or hoodwinking, one after another, tho&s;e &s;entries who are po&s;ted by the con&s;titution of a free country, for warning the people of their danger, When the&s;e preparatory &s;teps are once made, the people may then, indeed, with regret, &s;ee &s;lavery and arbitrary power making long &s;trides over their land; but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="165"><Q>The &s;tage, my Lords, and the pre&s;s, are two of our out-&s;entries; if we remove them, if we hoodwink them, if we throw them in fetters, the enemy may &s;urpri&s;e us.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, this &s;ubject was &s;till more lately put in the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t forcible light by a noble per&s;on high in the Magi&s;tracy; and who&s;e mind is not at all tuned to the introduction of di&s;order by improper popular exce&s;&s;es; I mean Lord Loughborough, chief Ju&s;tice of the Court of Common Pleas. I believe I can an&s;wer for the correctne&s;s of my note, which I &s;hall fol|low up with the opinion of another member of the Lord's hou&s;e of Parliament; the pre|&s;ent Earl Stanhope; or rather, I &s;hall take Lord Stanhope fir&s;t, as his Lord&s;hip introduces the &s;ubject by adverting to this argument of Lord Loughborough's. "If," &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, <Q>our boa&s;ted liberty of the pre&s;s, were to con|&s;i&s;t only in the liberty to write in prai&s;e of the Con&s;titution, this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments. I &s;up|po&s;e it would not be deemed quite an unpar|donable offence, even by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, if any man were to take into his head to write a panegyric upon the Ru&s;&s;ian form of Government. Such a liberty as that might therefore properly be termed the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian liberty of the Pre&s;s. But, the Engli&s;h liberty of the Pre&s;s</HI> is of a very different de|&s;cription: for, by the law of England, it is not prohibited to publi&s;h &s;peculative works upon the Con&s;titution, whether <HI>they con|tain prai&s;e or cen&s;ure.</HI></Q>&mdash;<HI>Lord Stanhope's de|fence of the Libel Bill.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="166">You &s;ee therefore, as far as the general principle goes, I am &s;upported by the opi|nion of Lord Stanhope, for otherwi&s;e the noble Lord has written a libel him&s;elf, by exciting other people to write <HI>whatever they may think,</HI> be it good or evil, of the con&s;titution of the country. As to the other high authority, Lord Loughborough, I will read what applies to this &s;ubject&mdash;'Every man' &s;aid Lord Loughborough, <Q>may publi&s;h at his di&s;cretion his opinions concerning forms and &s;y&s;tems of Government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If they be wi&s;e and enlightening, the world will gain by them; if they be weak and ab|&s;urd, they will be laughed at and forgotten; and, if they be <HI>bona fide,</HI> they cannot be cri|minal, however erroneous. On the other hand, the purpo&s;e and the direction may give a different turn to writings who&s;e common con&s;truction is harmle&s;s or even meritorious. Suppo&s;e men, a&s;&s;embled in di&s;turbance of the peace, to pull down mills or turnpikes, or to do any other mi&s;chief, and that a mi&s;chie|vous per&s;on &s;hould di&s;per&s;e among them an excitation to the planned mi&s;chief known to both writer and reader, <HI>To your tents, O I&s;rael;</HI> that publication would be criminal. But how criminal? not as a libel, not as an ab|&s;tract writing, but as an act; and the act being the crime <HI>it mu&s;t be &s;tated as a fact ex|trin&s;ic on the record:</HI> for, otherwi&s;e, a Court of Error could have no juri&s;diction but over the natural con&s;truction of the writing; nor would the defendant have any notice of &s;uch matter at the trial, without a charge on the
<PB N="168" REF="167">Record. To give the Jury cognizance of any matter beyond the con&s;truction of the writing, the averrment &s;hould be in the ca&s;e as I have in&s;tanced, that certain per&s;ons were, as I have de&s;cribed, a&s;&s;embled; and that the publi&s;her, intending to execute the&s;e per&s;ons &s;o a&s;&s;embled, wrote <HI>&s;o and &s;o.</HI> Here the crime is complete, and con&s;i&s;ts in an overt-act of wickedne&s;s evidenced by a writing.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to all the&s;e authorities, the At|torney General may &s;ay, that, if Mr. Paine had written his ob&s;ervations with the views of tho&s;e high per&s;ons and under other circum&s;tances, he would be protected and acquitted: to which I can only an&s;wer, that no facts or cir|cum&s;tances attending his work are either charged or proved; that you have no juri&s;dic|tion whatever but over the natural con&s;truction of the work before you, and that I am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the pa&s;&s;ages which are the particular &s;ubject of complaint.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am not unmindful how long I have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon your patience; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. recollecting the nature of the human mind, and how much, for a thou&s;and rea&s;ons, I have to &s;truggle again&s;t at this moment, I &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll not be di&s;concerted if any of you &s;hould appear anxious to retire from the pain of hear|ing me farther. It has been &s;aid, that my vanity has forwarded my zeal in this cau&s;e; but I might appeal even to the authors of tho&s;e paragraphs, whether a &s;ituation ever exi&s;ted which vanity would have been fonder to fly
<PB N="169" REF="168">from&mdash;the ta&s;k of &s;peaking again&s;t every known prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; with every countenance, as it were, planted and lifted up again&s;t me. But I &s;tand at this bar to give to a criminal arraigned before it, the defence which the law of the country entitles him to. If any of my arguments be indecent, or unfit for the Court to hear, the noble Judge pre&s;ides to interrupt them: If all, or any of them, are capable of an an&s;wer, they will be an&s;wered: Or, if they be &s;o unfounded in your own minds, who are to judge of them as not to call for refutation, your verdict in a moment will overthrow all that has been &s;aid&mdash;We &s;hall then have all di&s;|charged our duties&mdash;It is your's to judge, but m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne only to addre&s;s your judgments.</P>
<P>When my Lord and I were Coun&s;el for Lord George Gordon in 1781, it was not con&s;idered by that Jury, nor imputed to us by any body, that we were contending for the privileges of over-awing the Hou&s;e of Commons, or recom|mending the conflagration of this city: <HI>I</HI> am doing the &s;ame duty now, which <HI>my Lord and I</HI> then did in concert together; and, whatever may become of the cau&s;e, I expect to be heard: con&s;cious that no ju&s;t obloquy can be, or will <HI>(in the end)</HI> be ca&s;t upon me for having done my duty in the manner I have endeavoured to perform it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I come now to ob&s;erve on the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected by the information; and with regard to the fir&s;t I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of it in a moment.</P>
<P><Q>All <HI>Hereditary</HI> government is in its na|ture tyranny. An hereditable crown, or
<PB N="170" REF="169">an hereditable throne, or by what other fan|ciful name &s;uch things may be called, have no other &s;ignificant explanation than that mankind are hereditable <HI>property.</HI> To <HI>in|herit</HI> a government is to <HI>inherit</HI> the <HI>people,</HI> as if they were flocks and herds.</Q></P>
<P>And is it to be endured, &s;ays the Attorney General, that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or &s;heep? Certainly not I am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be in&s;tilled into the people of England. But who in&s;tils &s;uch a doctrine? I deny it is in&s;tilled by Paine. For when he maintains that hereditary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds, it is clear from the context <HI>(which is ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out of view,)</HI> that he is combating the propo&s;ition in Mr. Burke's book, which a&s;&s;erts, that the hereditary monarchy of England is fa&s;tened upon the peo|ple of England by indi&s;&s;oluble compact. Mr. Paine, on the contrary, a&s;&s;erts the King of England to be the <HI>magi&s;trate of the people,</HI> exi&s;t|ing by their con&s;ent, which is utterly incom|patible with their being driven like herds. His argument, therefore, is this, and it retorts on his adver&s;ary: he &s;ays, &s;uch a King as you repre&s;ent the King of England to be, inheriting the people by virtue of conque&s;t, or of &s;ome compact, which, having once exi&s;ted, cannot be di&s;&s;olved while the original terms of it are kept, <HI>is an inheritance like flocks and herds.</HI> But I deny that to be the King of England's title, he is <HI>the magi&s;trate of the people,</HI> and that title I re&s;pect. It is to your own imaginary King of
<PB N="171" REF="170">England therefore, and not to his Maje&s;ty, that your unfounded innuendos apply. It is the Monarchs of Ru&s;&s;ia and Pru&s;&s;ia, and all Go|vernments fa&s;tened upon unwilling &s;ubjects by hereditary indefea&s;ible titles, that are &s;tigma|ti&s;ed by Paine as inheriting the people like flocks. The &s;entence, therefore, mu&s;t either be taken in the pure ab&s;tract, and then it is not only merely &s;peculative, but the application of it to our own Government fails altogether, or it mu&s;t be taken connected with the matter which con&s;titutes the application, and then it is Mr. Burke's King of England, and not his Maje&s;ty who&s;e title is denied.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s therefore to the next pa&s;&s;age, which appears to be an extraordinary &s;election. It is taken at a leap from page 21 to page 47, and breaks in at the words, "This convention." The &s;entence &s;elected &s;tands thus, <Q>This con|vention met at Philadelphia in May 1787, of which General Wa&s;hington was elected pre&s;ident. He was not at that time con|nected with any of the &s;tate governments, or with Congre&s;s. He delivered up his com|mi&s;&s;ion when the war ended, and &s;ince then had lived a private citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Convention went deeply into all the &s;ubjects; and having after a variety of debate and inve&s;tigation, agreed among them&s;elves upon the &s;everal parts of a federal Con&s;ti|tution, the next que&s;tion was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this purpo&s;e, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, &s;end for a Dutch Stadt|holder, or a German Elector; but they re|ferred
<PB N="172" REF="171">the whole matter to the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;t of the country.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;entence, &s;tanding thus by it&s;elf, may appear to be a mere &s;arca&s;m on King William, upon tho&s;e who effected the Revolution; and upon the Revolution it&s;elf, without any rea&s;on|ing or deduction: But when the context and &s;equel are looked at and compared, it will ap|pear to be a &s;erious Hi&s;torical compari&s;on between the Revolution effected in England in 1688, and the late one in America when &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed her independence; and no man can doubt that his judgment on that compari&s;on was &s;incere. But where is the Libel on the Con&s;titution? For whether King William was brought over here by the &s;incere&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t motives of the whole people of England, each man acting for him&s;elf, or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant, it &s;igni|fies not one farthing at this time of day to the e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf. Black&s;tone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the Govern|ment on the motives of our ance&s;tors, or the rectitude of their rea&s;onings, but to be &s;atisfied that it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is &s;afe rea&s;oning, and, for my own part, I &s;hould not be differ|ently affected to the Con&s;titution of my country, which my own under&s;tanding approved, whe|ther angels or demons had given it birth.</P>
<P>Do any of you love the reformation the le&s;s becau&s;e Henry the eighth was the author of it? Or becau&s;e lu&s;t and poverty, and not religion, were his motives. He had &s;quandered the trea|&s;ures of his father, and he preferred Anne Bullen to his Queen; the&s;e were the cau&s;es
<PB N="173" REF="172">which produced it.&mdash;What then! does that af|fect the purity of our reformed religion, under|mine its e&s;tabli&s;hment, or &s;hake the King's title as Prince of the country, to the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e who held by the religion it had aboli&s;hed? Will the Attorney General affirm, that I could be convicted of a libel for a whole volume of a&s;perity again&s;t Henry the Eighth, merely be|cau&s;e he effected the reformation; and if not, why again&s;t King William, who effected the Revolution? Where is the line to be drawn? Is one, two, or three centuries to be the &s;tatute of limitation? But do not our own hi&s;torians de|tail this very cabal of courtiers, from the re|cords of our own country? If you will turn to Hume's hi&s;tory, volume the eighth, page 188, &amp;c. &amp;c. you will find that he &s;tates at great length, the whole detail of intrigues which paved the way for the Revolution, and the in|tere&s;ted coalition of parties which gave it effect.</P>
<P>But what of all this, concerning the motives of parties, which is recorded by Hume. The que&s;tion is, <HI>What is the thing brought about,&mdash;Not</HI> HOW <HI>it was brought about.</HI> If it &s;tands as Black&s;tone argues it, upon the con&s;ent of our ance&s;tors, followed up by our own, no indivi|dual can withdraw his obedience. If he di&s;|likes the e&s;tabli&s;hment, let him &s;eek el&s;ewhere for another; I am not contending for un|controuled <HI>conduct,</HI> but for freedom of <HI>opi|nion.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to what has been &s;tated of the <HI>Edwards</HI> and <HI>Henrys,</HI> and the other princes under which the author can only di&s;cover <HI>"re|&s;trictions on power, but nothing of a con&s;titu|tion:"</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="173">&s;urely my friend is not in earne&s;t when he &s;elects that as a libel.</P>
<P>Paine in&s;i&s;ts, that there was no con&s;titution under the&s;e princes, and that Engli&s;h liberty was obtained from u&s;urped power by the &s;trug|gles of the people. So SAY I. And I think it for the honor and advantage of the country that it &s;hould be known.</P>
<P>Was there any freedom after the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Normans by conque&s;t? Was not the MAGNA CHARTA wre&s;ted from John by open force of arms at Runnymead? Was it not again re-enacted whil&s;t menacing arms were in the hands of the people? Were not it's &s;tipulations broken through, and two and forty times re-enacted by Parliament, upon the firm demand of the people in the following reigns? I prote&s;t it fills me with a&s;toni&s;hment to hear the&s;e truths brought in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I was formerly called upon under the di&s;ci|pline of a College to maintain them, and was rewarded for being thought to have &s;ucce&s;sfully maintained that our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution was by no means a remnant of Saxon liberty, nor any other in&s;titution of liberty, but the pure con|&s;equence of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Norman tenures, which &s;preading the &s;pirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to another, ena|bled our brave fathers, inch by inch, not to re|conquer, <HI>but for the fir&s;t time to obtain</HI> tho&s;e privileges which are the unalienable inheritance of all mankind.</P>
<P>But why do we &s;peak of the Edwards and Henries, when Hume him&s;elf expre&s;sly &s;ays, notwith&s;tanding all we have heard to-day of
<PB N="175" REF="174">the antiquity of our con&s;titution, that our monarchy was nearly ab&s;olute till the middle of la&s;t century. I have his book in Court, and will read it to you. It is his E&s;&s;ay on the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, vol. I, page 15.</P>
<P><Q>All ab&s;olute Governments, and &s;uch in a great mea&s;ure was England, till the middle of the la&s;t century, <HI>notwith&s;tanding the nume|rous panegyries on</HI> ANCIENT <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty,</HI> mu&s;t very much depend on the admini&s;tra|tion.</Q></P>
<P>This is Hume's opinion; the conclu&s;ion of a grave hi&s;torian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for hi&s;tory: and &s;hall it be &s;aid that Mr. Paine is to be puni&s;hed for writing to-day what was before written by another, who is now a di&s;tingui&s;hed cla&s;&s;ic in the language? All the verdicts in the world will not make that palateable to an impartial public, or to po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;age arraigned is this: p. 56. <Q>The attention of the government of England, (for I rather chu&s;e to call it by this name, than the Engli&s;h government) appears, &s;ince it's political connection with Germany, to have been &s;o compleatly engro&s;&s;ed and ab|&s;orbed by foreign affairs, and the means of rai&s;ing taxes, that it &s;eems to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;es. Dome&s;tic concerns are neg|lected; and with re&s;pect to regular law, there is &s;carcely &s;uch a thing.</Q></P>
<P>That the government of this country is, in con&s;equence of it's connection with the Conti|nent, and the continental wars which it has occa&s;ioned, been continually loaded with griev|ous
<PB N="176" REF="175">taxes, no man can di&s;pute; and I appeal to your ju&s;tice, whether this &s;ubject has not been, for years together, the con&s;tant topic of unreproved declamation and grumbling?</P>
<P>As to what he &s;ays with regard to there hard|ly being &s;uch a thing as regular law, he &s;peaks in the ab&s;tract of the complexity of our &s;y&s;tem; but does not arraign the admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice <HI>in it's practice.</HI> But with regard to cri|tici&s;ms and &s;trictures on the general &s;y&s;tem, it has been echoed over and over again by various authors; and even from the pulpits of our country, that the law of the land is mainly de|fective, devoid of regularity and preci&s;ion, and overloaded with a variety of expen&s;ive and un|nece&s;&s;ary forms. I have a Sermon in Court written during the American war, by a per&s;on of great eloquence and piety, part of which I will read to you on this &s;ubject, in which he looks forward to an exemption from the into|lerable grievances of our old legal &s;y&s;tem in the infant e&s;tabli&s;hment of the New World.</P>
<P><Q>It may be in the purpo&s;es of providence, on yon we&s;tern &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ores, to rai&s;e the bulwark of a purer reformation than ever Britain pa|tronized; to &s;ound a le&s;s burthen&s;ome, more au&s;picious, &s;table, and incorruptible govern|ment than ever Britain has enjoyed; and to e&s;tabli&s;h there a &s;y&s;tem of law more ju&s;t and &s;imple in it's principles, le&s;s intricate, dubi|ous and dilatory in it's proceedings, more mild and equitable in it's &s;anctions, more ea&s;y and more certain in it's execution; wherein no man can err through ignorance of what concerns him, or want ju&s;tice through
<PB N="177" REF="176">poverty or weakne&s;s, or e&s;cape it by legal artifice, or civil privileges, or interpo&s;ing power; wherein the rule of conduct &s;hall not be hidden or di&s;gui&s;ed in the language of principles and cu&s;toms that died with the barbari&s;m which gave them birth; wherein ha&s;ty formulas &s;hall not di&s;&s;ipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and tran&s;actions of ju&s;tice; wherein ob&s;olete pre&s;cripts &s;hall not pervert, nor entangle, nor impede the admini&s;tration of it, nor in any in&s;tance ex|po&s;e it to deri&s;ion or to di&s;regard; wherein mi&s;repre&s;entation &s;hall have no &s;hare in de|ciding upon right and truth; and under which no man &s;hall grow great by the wages of chicanery, or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers.</Q></P>
<P>This is ten times &s;tronger than Mr. Paine; but who ever thought of pro&s;ecuting Mr. Cappe?</P>
<P>In various other in&s;tances you will find de|fects in our juri&s;prudence pointed out and lamented, and not &s;eldom by per&s;ons called upon by their &s;ituations to deliver the law in the &s;eat of magi&s;tracy: therefore, the author's <HI>general</HI> ob&s;ervation does not appear to be that &s;pecies of attack upon the magi&s;tracy of the country, as to fall within the de&s;cription of a libel.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the two Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, I believe I &s;hall be able to &s;hew you that the very per&s;on who introduced this controver&s;y, and who certainly is con&s;idered by tho&s;e who now admini&s;ter the government, as a man u&s;e|fully devoted to maintain the con&s;titution of
<PB N="178" REF="177">the country in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, has him&s;elf made remarks upon the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies; that upon compari&s;on you will think more &s;evere than tho&s;e which are the &s;ubject of the Attor|ney General's animadver&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;age in Mr. Paine runs thus:</P>
<P><Q>With re&s;pect to <HI>the two hou&s;es,</HI> of which the Engli&s;h Parliament is compo&s;ed, they ap|pear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legi&s;lature, to have no temper of it's own. The mini&s;ter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it &s;leeps obedience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But if we look at the di&s;tinct abilities of the two hou&s;es, the difference will appear &s;o great, as to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to u&s;e it. Wretched as the &s;tate of repre&s;entation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;o little is this nick-named hou&s;e regarded, that the people &s;carcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It appears al&s;o to be mo&s;t under influence, and the furthe&s;t removed from the general intere&s;t of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, and which was meant by Paine as evidence of the previous affection, the Attorney General has omitted in the information, and in his &s;peech, it is this: <Q>In the debate on engaging in the Ru&s;&s;ian and Turki&s;h war, the majority in the Hou&s;e of Peers in favour of it was upwards of ninety, when in the other hou&s;e, which is more than
<PB N="179" REF="178">double it's numbers, the majority was &s;ixty-three.</Q></P>
<P>The terms, however, in which Mr. Burke &s;peaks of the Hou&s;e of Lords, are &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive. <Q>It is &s;omething more than a cen|tury ago, &s;ince we voted the Hou&s;e of Lords u&s;ele&s;s. They have now voted them&s;elves &s;o, and the whole hope of reformation</Q> (<HI>&s;peaking of the Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> <Q>is ca&s;t up|on us.</Q> This &s;entiment, Mr. Burke not only expre&s;&s;ed in his place in parliament, where no man can call him to an account; but it has been &s;ince, repeatedly printed among&s;t his other va|luable works. And his opinion of BOTH THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, which I am about to read to you, was originally publi&s;hed as a pamphlet, and applied to the &s;ettled habitual abu&s;es of the&s;e high a&s;&s;emblies. Remember, I do not u&s;e them as <HI>argumenta ad hominem,</HI> or <HI>ad invidiam</HI> again&s;t the author, for if I did, it could be no defence of Mr. Paine. But I u&s;e them as high authority, the work <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's Thoughts on the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;contents, publi&s;hed in 1775.</NOTE> having been the ju&s;t foundation of &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;t|ing reputation. Would to God that any part of it were capable of being denied or doubted.</P>
<P><Q>Again&s;t the being of parliament I am &s;atis|fied no de&s;igns have ever been entertained &s;ince the Revolution. Every one mu&s;t per|ceive that it is &s;trongly the intere&s;t of the Court to have &s;ome &s;econd cau&s;e interpo&s;ed between the mini&s;ters and the people. The gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons have an
<PB N="180" REF="179">intere&s;t equally &s;trong, in &s;u&s;taining the part of that intermediate cau&s;e. However they may hire out the u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct of their voices, they ne|ver will part with the <HI>&s;ee and inheritance.</HI> Accordingly tho&s;e who have been of the mo&s;t known devotion to the will and plea&s;ure of a court, have at the &s;ame time been mo&s;t for|ward in a&s;&s;erting an high authority in the Hou&s;e of Commons. <HI>When they knew who were to use that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought it never could be car|ried too far.</HI> It mu&s;t be always the wi&s;h of an uncon&s;titutional &s;tate&s;man, that an Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>who are entirely dependent upon him, &s;hould have every right of the people de|pendent upon their plea&s;ure.</HI> FOR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMS OF A FREE, AND THE ENDS OF AN ARBITRARY GO|VERNMENT, WERE THINGS NOT ALTO|GETHER INCOMPATIBLE.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The power of the crown almo&s;t dead and rotten as Prerogative, has grown up anew, with much more &s;trength and far le&s;s odium, under the name of influence. An influence which operates without noi&s;e and violence; which converts the very antagoni&s;t into the in&s;trument of power: which contains in it|&s;elf a perpetual principle of growth and reno|vation: and which the di&s;tre&s;&s;e; and the pro&s;perity of the country equally tend to augment, was an admirable &s;ub&s;titute for a Prerogative, that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its original &s;tamina irre&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ible principles of de|cay and di&s;&s;olution. The ignorance of the
<PB N="181" REF="180">people is a bottom but for a temporary &s;y&s;|tem; but the intere&s;t of active men in the &s;tate is a foundation perpetual and infallible.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke therefore, in page 66, &s;peaking of the &s;ame court party, &s;ays:</P>
<P><Q>Parliament was indeed the great object of all the&s;e polities, the end at which they aimed, as well as the INSTRUMENT by which they were to operate.</Q></P>
<P>And pur&s;uing the &s;ubject in page 70, pro|ceeds as follows:</P>
<P><Q>They who will not conform their conduct to the public good, and cannot &s;upport it by the prerogative of the crown, have adopted a new plan. They have totally abandoned the &s;hattered and old-fa&s;hioned fortre&s;s of pre+rogative, and made a lodgement in the &s;trong hold of parliament it&s;elf. If they have any evil de&s;ign to which there is no ordinary le|gal power commen&s;urate, they bring it into parliament. <HI>There the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. And the power of ob|taining their object ab&s;olute: and the &s;afety in the proceeding perfect; no rules to confine, nor after reckonings to terrify.</HI> For parliament cannot with any great propriety puni&s;h others for things in which they them&s;elves have been ACCOMPLICES. Thus its controul upon the executory power is lo&s;t ; becau&s;e it is made to partake in every con&s;iderable act of government, <HI>and impeachment, that great guardian of the purity of the Con&s;titution, is in danger of being lo&s;t even to the idea of it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an A&s;&s;embly, &s;till in
<PB N="182" REF="181">&s;ome &s;ort popular, led to the greate&s;t honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is rever&s;ed; and the fa|vour of the court is the only &s;ure way of ob|taining and holding tho&s;e honours which ought to be IN THE DISPOSAL OF THE PEO|PLE.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in page 100, ob&s;erves with great truth, that the mi&s;chiefs he complained of, did not at all ari&s;e from the Monarchy, but from the parliament, and that it was the duty of the people to look to it. He &s;ays, <Q>The di&s;tem|pers of monarchy were the great &s;ubjects of apprehen&s;ion and redre&s;s, in the <HI>la&s;t cen|tury; in this,</HI> the di&s;tempers of parliament.</Q></P>
<P>Not the di&s;tempers of parliament in this year or the la&s;t, but in <HI>this century,</HI> i. e. its &s;ettled habitual di&s;temper. <Q>It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary di&s;|orders can be compleated; and hardly in|deed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the people ought to be <HI>excited</HI> to a more &s;trict and de|tailed attention to the conduct of their repre|&s;entatives. Standards for judging more &s;y&s;|tematically upon their conduct ought to be &s;ettled in the meetings of counties and cor|porations, and frequent and correct li&s;ts of the voters in all important que&s;tions ought to be procured.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By &s;uch means &s;omething may be done, &s;ince it may appear who tho&s;e are, that by an indi&s;criminate &s;upport of all admini&s;trations, have totally ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed all integrity and confi|dence
<PB N="183" REF="182">out of public proceedings; have con|founded the be&s;t men with the wor&s;t; and weakened and di&s;&s;olved, in&s;tead of &s;trengthen|ing and compacting the general frame of go|vernment.</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was po&s;&s;ible to read the whole of this mo&s;t important volume&mdash;but the con&s;e|quences of the&s;e truths contained in it were all eloquently &s;ummed up by the author in his &s;peech upon the reform of the hou&s;ehold.</P>
<P><Q>But what I confe&s;s was uppermo&s;t with me, what I bent the whole cour&s;e of my mind to, was the reduction of that corrupt influence which is it&s;elf the perennial &s;pring of all pro|digality and di&s;order: which loads us more than millions of debt; which takes away vigour from our arms, wi&s;dom from our councils, and every &s;hadow of authority and credit from the mo&s;t venerable parts of our con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame important truths were held out to the whole public, upon a &s;till later occa&s;ion, by the per&s;on now at the head of his Maje&s;ty's coun|cils: and &s;o high (as it appears) in the confidence of the nation. <HI>He.</HI> not in the ab&s;tract like the author before you, but upon the &s;pur of the oc|ca&s;ion, and in the teeth of what had been ju&s;t declared in the Hou&s;e of Commons, came to, and acted upon re&s;olutions which are contained in this book. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Er&s;kine took up a book.</NOTE> Re&s;olutions pointed to the puri|fication of a parliament, dangerou&s;ly corrupted into the very &s;tate de&s;cribed by Mr. Paine. Re|member here too, that I impute no cen&s;ure to Mr. Pitt. It was the mo&s;t brilliant pa&s;&s;age in
<PB N="184" REF="183">his life, and I &s;hould have thought his life a better one, if he had continued uniform in the &s;upport of opinions, which it is &s;aid he has not changed, and which certainly have had no|thing to change them. But at all events, I have a right to make u&s;e of the authority of his &s;plendid talents and &s;ituation, not merely to protect the defendant, but the public, and to re&s;i&s;t the precedent, That what one man may do in England with approbation and glory, &s;hall conduct another man to a pillory or a pri|&s;on.</P>
<P>It was the abu&s;es pointed out by the man be|fore you, that led that Right Hon. Gentleman to a&s;&s;ociate with many others of high rank, under the banners of the Duke of Richmond, who&s;e name &s;tands at the head of the li&s;t, and to pa&s;s various public re&s;olutions, concerning the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of purifying the Hou&s;e of Commons; and we collect the plan from a pre|amble entered in the book. <Q>Whereas the life, liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives, and every man is bound to pay obedi|ence to the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas, by the con&s;titution of this kingdom the right of making laws is ve&s;ted in three e&s;tates, of King, Lords, and Com|mons, in parliament a&s;&s;embled, and the con|&s;ent of all the three &s;aid e&s;tates, comprehend|ing the whole community, is nece&s;&s;ary to make laws to bind the whole community. And whereas the Hou&s;e of Commons repre|&s;ents all the Commons of the realm, and the
<PB N="185" REF="184">con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Commons binds the con&s;ent of all the Commons of the realm, and in all ca&s;es on which the legi&s;lature is compe|tent to decide.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas no man is, or can be actually repre&s;ented who hath not a vote in the elec|tion of his repre&s;entative.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas it is the right of every Com|moner of this realm (infants, per&s;ons of in|&s;ane mind, and criminals incapacitated by law, only excepted) to have a vote in the election of the repre&s;entative who is to give his con&s;ent to the making of laws by which he is to be bound.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas the number of per&s;ons who are &s;uffered to vote for electing the members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, do not at this time amount to one-&s;ixth part of the whole Commons of this realm, whereby far the greater part of the &s;aid Commons are deprived of their right to elect their repre&s;entatives; and the con&s;ent of the majority of the whole community to the pa&s;&s;ing of laws, is given by per&s;ons whom they have not delegated for &s;uch purpo&s;es; and the majority of the &s;aid community, and to which the &s;aid ma|jority have not in fact con&s;ented by them|&s;elves or by their repre&s;entatives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And whereas the &s;tate of election of mem|bers of the Hou&s;e of Commons, hath in proce&s;s of time &s;o gro&s;ly deviated from its &s;imple and natural principle of repre&s;entation and equality, that in &s;everal places, the mem|bers are returned by the property of one man;
<PB N="186" REF="185">that the &s;malle&s;t boroughs &s;end as many members as the large&s;t counties, and that a majority of the repre&s;entatives of the whole nation are cho&s;en by a number of votes not exceeding twelve thou&s;and.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e with many others, were publi&s;hed, not as ab&s;tract, &s;peculative writings, but within a few days after the Hou&s;e of Commons had declared that no &s;uch rights exi&s;ted, and that no alteration was nece&s;&s;ary in the repre&s;entation. It was then that they met at the Thatched Hou&s;e, and publi&s;hed their opinions and re&s;o|lutions to the country at large.&mdash;Were any of them pro&s;ecuted for the&s;e proceedings? Cer|tainly not, (for they were legal proceedings.) But I de&s;ire you as men of honour and truth, to compare all this with Mr. Paine's expre&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;ter's touching Parliament with his opiate wand, and let equal ju&s;tice be done&mdash;that is all I a&s;k&mdash;let all be puni&s;hed or none&mdash;do not let Mr. Paine be held out to the con|tempt of the public upon the &s;core of his ob|&s;ervations on parliament, while others are enjoying all the &s;weets which attend a &s;uppo&s;ed attachment to their country, who have &s;aid the &s;ame things, and reduced their opinions to practice.</P>
<P>But now every man is to be cried down for &s;uch opinions. I ob&s;erved that my learned friend &s;ignificantly rai&s;ed his voice in naming Mr. Horne Tooke, as if to connect him with Paine, or Paine with him. This is exactly the &s;ame cour&s;e of ju&s;tice; for after all he &s;aid no|thing of Mr. Tooke. What could he have
<PB N="187" REF="186">&s;aid, but that he was a &s;ub&s;criber with the great names. I have read in the&s;e proceedings which they have thought fit to de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, let others hold their opinions, and change them at their plea&s;ure; I &s;hall ever maintain it to be the deare&s;t privilege of the people of Great Britain to watch over every thing that affects their good government, either in the &s;y&s;tem, or in the practice: and that for this purpo&s;e the pre&s;s mu&s;t be free. It has always been &s;o, and much evil has been cor|rected by it.&mdash;If government finds it&s;elf an|noyed by it, let it examine it's own conduct, and it will find the cau&s;e,&mdash;let it amend it, and it will find the remedy.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am no friend to &s;arca&s;ms in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of grave &s;ubjects, but you mu&s;t take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment; Mr. Burke as often as any body indulges in it:&mdash;hear his rea&s;on in his &s;peech on reform, for not taking away the &s;alaries from Lords who attend upon the Briti&s;h Court. "You would," &s;aid he, <Q>have the court de&s;ert|ed by all the nobility of the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir, the mo&s;t &s;erious mi&s;chiefs would fol|low from &s;uch a de&s;ertion. Kings are natu|rally lovers of low company; they are &s;o elevated above all the re&s;t of mankind, that they mu&s;t look upon all their &s;ubjects as on a level: they are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occa|&s;ional re&s;i&s;tance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petulance, or their pride. It mu&s;t indeed be admitted, that
<PB N="188" REF="187">many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, pa|ra&s;ites, pimps, and bu&s;&s;oons, as any of the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind can po&s;&s;ibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, with &s;ome lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a &s;idler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe. The Roman Emperors, almo&s;t from the beginning, threw them&s;elves into &s;uch hands; and the mi&s;chief increa&s;ed every day, till it's decline, and it's final ruin. It is, therefore, of very great importance (pro|vided the thing is not overdone,) to contrive &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment as mu&s;t, almo&s;t whether a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his per&s;on, a great number of his fir&s;t nobility; and it is rather an u&s;eful prejudice that gives them a pride in &s;uch a &s;ervitude: though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have therefore, not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the King's per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>What is this but &s;aying that a King is an animal &s;o incurably addicted to low company, as generally to bring on by it the ruin of nations; but neverthele&s;s, he is to be kept as a nece&s;&s;ary evil, and his propen&s;ities bridled by &s;urrounding him with a parcel of mi&s;creants &s;till wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible, but better than tho&s;e he
<PB N="189" REF="188">would cho&s;e for him&s;elf.&mdash;This therefore, if taken by it&s;elf, would be a mo&s;t abominable and libellous &s;arca&s;m on Kings and Nobility: but look at the whole &s;peech, and you ob&s;erve a great &s;y&s;tem of regulation; and no man, I be|lieve, ever doubted Mr. Burke's attachment to monarchy. To judge, therefore, of any part of a writing, the whole mu&s;t be read.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame view I mean to read to you the beginning of Harrington's Oceana: but it is impo&s;&s;ible to name this well known author without expo&s;ing to ju&s;t contempt and ridicule the ignorant or profligate mi&s;repre&s;entations which are vomited forth upon the public, to bear down every man as de&s;perately wicked, who in any age or country has countenanced a Republic, for the mean purpo&s;e of prejudging this trial.</P>
<STAGE>[Mr. Er&s;kine took up a book, but laid it down again without reading from it, &s;aying &s;omething to the gentleman who &s;at near him, in a low voice, which I did not hear.]</STAGE>
<P>Is this the way to &s;upport the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution? Are the&s;e the means by which Engli&s;hmen are to be taught to cheri&s;h it? I &s;ay, if the man upon trial were &s;tained with blood in&s;tead of ink,&mdash;if he were covered over with crimes which human nature would &s;tart at the naming of, the means employed again&s;t him would not be the le&s;s di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>For this notable purpo&s;e then, Harrington, not above a week ago, was handed out to us as a low, ob&s;cure wretch, involved in the murder of the Monarch, and the de&s;truction of the
<PB N="190" REF="189">Monarchy, and as addre&s;&s;ing his de&s;picable works at the &s;hrine of an U&s;urper. Yet this very Harrington, this low blackguard, was de|&s;cended (you may &s;ee his pedigree at the Herald's Office for &s;ixpence,) from eight Dukes, three Marqui&s;&s;es, &s;eventy Earls, twenty-&s;even Vi&s;counts, and thirty-&s;ix Barons, &s;ixteen of whom were Knights of the Garter; a de&s;cent which I think would &s;ave a man from di&s;grace in any of the circles of Germany. But what was he be&s;ides?&mdash;A BLOOD-STAINED RUFFIAN? Oh brutal ignorance of the hi&s;tory of the Country! He was the mo&s;t affectionate &s;ervant of Charles the Fir&s;t, from whom he never concealed his opi|nions: for it is ob&s;erved by Wood, that the King greatly affected his company; but when they happened to talk of a Common-wealth, he would &s;carcely endure it.&mdash;'I know not,' &s;ays Toland, <Q>which mo&s;t to commend; the King for tru&s;ting an hone&s;t man, though a Repub|lican; or Harrington for owning his principles while he &s;erved a King.</Q></P>
<P>But did his opinions affect his conduct?&mdash; Let Hi&s;tory again an&s;wer.&mdash;He pre&s;erved his fidelity to his unhappy Prince to the very la&s;t, af|ter all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged &s;ubjects. He &s;taid with him while a pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of Wight: came up by &s;tealth to follow the fortunes of his monarch and ma&s;ter; even hid him&s;elf in the boot of the coach when he was conveyed to Wind&s;or; and ending a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he began, fell into his arms and fainted on the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>After Charles's death, the Oceana was writ|ten,
<PB N="191" REF="190">and, as if it were written from ju&s;tice and affection to his memory: for it breathes the &s;ame noble and &s;pirited regard, and a&s;&s;erts that it was not Charles that brought on the de&s;truc|tion of the monarchy, but the feeble and ill con&s;tituted nature of monarchy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the book was a flattery to Cromwell.&mdash; Once more and finally let hi&s;tory decide.</P>
<P>It was &s;eized by the U&s;urper as a libel, and the way it was recovered is remarkable. I mention it to &s;hew that Cromwell was a wi&s;e man in him&s;elf, and knew on what govern|ments mu&s;t &s;tand for their &s;upport.</P>
<P>Harrington waited on his daughter to beg for his book, and on entering her apartment, &s;natched up her child and ran away.&mdash;On her following him with &s;urprize and terror, he turned to her and &s;aid, <Q>I know what you feel as a mother, feel then for me; your father has got my child:</Q> meaning the Oceana. The Oceana was afterwards re&s;tored on her petition; Cromwell an&s;wering with the &s;agacity of a &s;ound politician, <Q>Let him have his book; if my government is made to &s;tand, it has nothing to fear from PAPER SHOT.</Q>&mdash;He &s;aid true.&mdash;No good government will ever be battered by paper &s;hot. Monte&s;quieu &s;ays that <Q>In a free nation, it matters not whether indi|viduals rea&s;on well or ill; it is &s;ufficient that they do rea&s;on. Truth ari&s;es from the col|li&s;ion, and from hence &s;prings liberty, which is a &s;ecurity from the effect of rea&s;oning.</Q> The Attorney-General read extracts from Mr. Adams's an&s;wer to this book. Let others do
<PB N="192" REF="191">like Mr. Adams: I am not in&s;i&s;ting upon the infallibility of Mr Paine's doctrines; if they are erroneous, let them be an&s;wered, and truth will &s;pring from the colli&s;ion.</P>
<P>A di&s;po&s;ition in a nation to this &s;pecies of controver&s;y, is no proof of &s;edition or de|generacy, but quite the rever&s;e, as is men|tioned by Milton, [I omitted to cite the pa&s;&s;age with the others] who in &s;peaking of this &s;ubject, ri&s;es into that inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;ub|lime &s;tile of writing, wholly peculiar to him&s;elf. He was indeed no plagiary from any thing human: he looked up for light and expre&s;&s;ion, as he him&s;elf wonderfully de&s;cribes it, by de|vout prayer to that great Being, who is the &s;ource of all utterance and knowledge; and who &s;endeth out his &s;eraphim with the hallowed fire of his altars to touch and purify the lips of whom he plea&s;es. <Q>When the chearfulne&s;s of the people,</Q> &s;ays this mighty poet, <Q>is &s;o &s;prightly up, as that it has not only where|with to guard well it's own freedom and &s;afety, but to &s;pare, and to be&s;tow upon the &s;olide&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t points of controver&s;y and new invention, it betokens us not de|generated nor drooping to a fatal decay, but ca&s;ting off the old and wrinkled &s;kin of cor|ruption to outlive the&s;e pangs, and wax young again, entering the glorious ways of truth and pro&s;perous virtue, de&s;tined to become great and honourable in the&s;e latter ages. Me|thinks I &s;ee, in my mind, a noble and pui&s;|&s;ant nation rou&s;ing her&s;elf, like a &s;trong man after &s;leep, and &s;haking her invincible locks; methinks I &s;ee her as an eagle muing her
<PB N="193" REF="192">mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam; purging and un&s;caling her long abu&s;ed &s;ight at the foun|tain it&s;elf of heavenly radiance; while the whole noi&s;e of timorous and flocking birds, with tho&s;e al&s;o that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what &s;he means, and in their envious gabble would progno&s;ticate a year of &s;ects and &s;chi&s;ms.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, what Milton only &s;aw in his mighty imagination, I &s;ee in fact; what he ex|pected, but which never came to pa&s;s, I &s;ee now fulfilling: methinks I &s;ee this noble and pui&s;|&s;ant nation, not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay, but ca&s;ting off the wrinkled &s;kin of corruption to put on again the vigour of her youth.</P>
<P>And it is, becau&s;e others, as well as my&s;elf &s;ee this, that we have all this uproar:&mdash;France and its con&s;titution are the mere pretences. It is, becau&s;e Britons begin to recollect the inhe|ritance of their own con&s;titution, left them by their ance&s;tors: It is, becau&s;e they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its mo&s;t valuable parts, that for&s;ooth the nation is in danger of being de&s;troyed by a &s;ingle pam|phlet.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have marked the cour&s;e of this alarm: It began with the renovation of tho&s;e exertions for the public, which the authors of the alarm had them&s;elves originated and de|&s;erted; and they became louder and louder when they &s;aw the&s;e principles avowed and &s;upported by my admirable and excellent friend
<PB N="194" REF="193">Mr. FOX; the mo&s;t eminently hone&s;t and en|lightened &s;tate&s;man, that hi&s;tory brings us ac|quainted with: a man whom to name is to ho|nour, but whom in attempting adequately to de&s;cribe, I mu&s;t fly to Mr. Burke, my con&s;tant refuge when eloquence is nece&s;&s;ary: a man, who to relieve the &s;ufferings of the mo&s;t di&s;|tant nation, <Q>put to the hazard his ea&s;e, his &s;e|curity, his intere&s;t, his power, even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he had never &s;een.</Q> How much more then for the inhabitants of his native country: yet this is the man who has been cen&s;ured and di&s;|avowed in the manner we have lately &s;een.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have but a few more words to trouble you with: I take my leave of you with declaring, that all this freedom which I have been endeavouring to a&s;&s;ert, is no more than the freedom which belongs to our own inbred con&s;titution: I have not a&s;ked you to acquit Mr. Paine upon any new lights, or upon any principle but the law, which you are &s;worn to admini&s;ter: My great object has been to in|culcate, that wi&s;dom and policy, which are the parents of the law of Great Britain, forbid this jealous eye over her &s;ubjects; and that, on the contrary, they cry aloud in the language of the poet, employed by Lord Chatham on the me|morable &s;ubject of America, unfortunately without effect:
<Q><L>Be to their faults a little blind,</L>
<L>Be to their virtues very kind;</L>
<L>Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</L>
<L>And clap your padlock on the mind.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="194">Engage them by their affections, convince their rea&s;on, and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty &s;incere, vigorous, or rational, a conviction that it is their true&s;t intere&s;t, and that their form of go|vernment is for their common good. Con|&s;traint is the natural parent of re&s;i&s;tance, and a pregnant proof, that rea&s;on is not on the &s;ide of tho&s;e who u&s;e it. You mu&s;t all remember, gen|tlemen, Lucian's plea&s;ant &s;tory; Jupiter and a countryman were walking together, conver&s;ing with great freedom and familiarity upon the &s;ubject of heaven and earth. The countryman li&s;tened with attention and acquie&s;cence, while Jupiter &s;trove only to convince him; but hap|pening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned ha&s;tily round and threatened him with his thunder.&mdash; "Ah! ha!" &s;ays the countryman, <Q>now Jupiter, I know that you are wrong; you're always wrong when you appeal to your thunder.</Q></P>
<P>This is the ca&s;e with me&mdash;I can rea&s;on with the people of England, but I cannot fight again&s;t the thunder of authority.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this is my defence for free opi|nions. With regard to my&s;elf, I am, and ever have been, obedient and affectionate to <HI>the law:</HI> to that rule of action, as long as I exi&s;t, I &s;hall ever give my voice and my conduct; but I &s;hall ever do as I have done to-day, maintain the dignity of my high profe&s;&s;ion, and perform, as I under&s;tand them, all its important duties.</P>
