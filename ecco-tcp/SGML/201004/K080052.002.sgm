<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>DURHAM is a maritime county, and takes its name from the city of Durham; commonly called the bi&s;hopric, and &s;ometimes the county palatine.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription given by Camden is to the following effect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden's Brit. (Gib&s;on's edition, 1772) vol. ii. p. 127.</NOTE>: <Q>It lies north of York&s;hire, and is &s;haped like a triangle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Geographers deale with countries as a&s;tronomers with their a&s;teri&s;mes, and fancy them into &s;hapes; as <HI>Italy</HI> into a man's legge, <HI>Spayne</HI> into an Oxhyde, and the forme of this bi&s;hoprick into a &utri;, or an equilateral triangle. It lyeth in the bo&s;ome of the Germaine Neptune, and embraced betweene the armes of the two chri&s;tall rivers <HI>Tee&s;e</HI> and <HI>Derwent.</HI>&mdash;Legend of St Cuthbert.</P></NOTE>, the apex or top whereof lies to the we&s;t, being formed there by the meeting of the north boundary and the head of the river Tees: The &s;outhern &s;ide is wholly bounded by the cour&s;e of the Tees: The northern &s;ide, from about the point of the angle, forms a line to the river Derwent, and then is bounded by that river</Q> (till it receives the rivu|let called Chopwell or Milkburn), <Q>and &s;o full north to the river Tyne: The ba&s;is of this triangle, to the ea&s;t, is formed by the &s;hore of the German ocean.</Q></P>
<P>Modern geographers have laid down the abuttals &s;o variou&s;ly, that in regard to the north-we&s;t point, we can in general only &s;ay, the river Tees totally &s;eparates the county of Durham from We&s;tmorland and York&s;hire, and a very narrow point of Cumberland intervenes between that river and the confines of Northumber|land, a &s;pace in which the proprietors are not well a&s;certained of their real boun|daries. On the other &s;ides, Camden's de&s;cription is accurate.</P>
<P>The parts of this county, extended into the upper point or apex of the triangle, Camden de&s;cribes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camd. Brit. ibid.</NOTE> <Q>to con&s;i&s;t of naked lands, the woods few, the hills bald, but not de&s;titute of veins of iron ore, whil&s;t the vallies produce plenty of gra&s;s, the Engli&s;h Appenines inter&s;ecting the country at this angle.</Q> At the di&s;tance of two hundred years, we cannot wonder at this picture of our county, or the igno|rance of naturali&s;ts in regard to its produce and riches: The contra&s;t we &s;hall draw, it is hoped, will prove intere&s;ting. Our author then proceeds to de&s;cribe the ea&s;tern &s;ide or ba&s;is of the triangle, where he ob&s;erves, <Q>as well as to the &s;outh, the &s;oil by tillage is rendered fertile, and the country enamelled with meadows, corn-fields, and pa&s;tures, and graced with many towns, the bowels of the earth abounding in coal.</Q> Such is the imperfect account given by this great wri|ter.</P>
<P>The Magna Britannia de&s;cribes this county to be thirty-five miles in length, thirty in breadth, and about one hundred and &s;even in circumference: Another account &s;ays, it is thirty-nine miles long, and thirty-five broad; containing nine hundred and fifty-eight &s;quare miles, and &s;ix hundred and ten thou&s;and acres of land; and comprehending one city, eleven other market towns, fifty-two pari&s;hes,

and twenty-one chapels; two hundred and twenty-three villages, nineteen thou&s;and nine hundred and eighty-five hou&s;es, and ninety-&s;even thou&s;and inhabitants; &s;ixteen rivers, twenty-one parks, and &s;everal ca&s;tles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>The county is divided into four wards, called Ea&s;ington ward, Stockton ward, Darlington ward, and Che&s;ter ward. We know no rea&s;on why the &s;everal di&s;tricts took tho&s;e denominations, or derived their names from places of inferior con&s;e|quence and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The air of the county is generally healthy, though cold on the hills; and accor|ding to &s;ome authors, that of the we&s;tern parts &s;harper than that of the ea&s;t. It is well watered by rivers and brooks, the chief of which are the Tees and Were <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Hollin&s;hed's de&s;cription of the&s;e two rivers, and the &s;everal &s;treams that join them, is &s;o accurate, that we cannot omit the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The THESE, a river that beareth and feedeth an excellent &s;almon, ri&s;eth in the Black Lowes, above two miles flat we&s;t of the &s;outherlie head of Were called <HI>Burdop,</HI> and &s;outh of the head of We&s;t Alen, and thence runneth through Tildale fore&s;t, and taking in the <HI>Langdon-water</HI> from northwd&s;t, it runneth to Durtpit chap|pel, to Newbiggin, and &s;o to Middleton, receiving by we&s;t of each of the&s;e a rill comming from by north (of which the la&s;t is called <HI>Hude</HI>) and likewi&s;e the <HI>Lune</HI> afterward by &s;outhwe&s;t, that ri&s;eth at three &s;everal places, whereof the fir&s;t is in the borders of We&s;tmerland and there called <HI>Arnegill-becke,</HI> the &s;econd more &s;outherlie named <HI>Lune-becke,</HI> and the third by &s;outh at Bandor Skarth-hill, and meeting all above Arnegill-hou&s;e, they run togither in one bottome to Lathekirke-bridge, and then into the The&s;e. Having therefore met with the&s;e, it runneth to Mickleton, and there taking in the <HI>Skirkwith-water,</HI> it goeth to Rombaldkirke, cro&s;&s;ing there al&s;o one rill and the Bander-brooke by &s;outhwe&s;t, and then going to Morewood-hag and Morewood-parke, till it come to Bernard's ca&s;tell. Here al&s;o it receiveth the <HI>Thure&s;gill-water</HI> coming ea&s;t of Rere-cro&s;&s;e in York&s;hire from the Spittle in Stanmore by Crag almo&s;t &s;outhwe&s;t, and being united with the The&s;e, it goeth by Stratford, Egle&s;don, Roke&s;bie, Thorpe, Wickliffe, Ovington, Win&s;ton, and betwene Barfurth and Gain|furth meeteth with another rill, that commeth from Langleie fore&s;t, betwene Rabie ca&s;tell and Standorpe, of who&s;e name I have no knowledge. But to proceed, the The&s;e being pa&s;t Ramfurth, runneth betwene Per&s;ore and Cliffe, and in the waie to Croft&s;bridge taketh in the <HI>Skerne,</HI> a pretie water, which ri&s;eth above Trimdon, and goeth by Fi&s;hburne, Bradburie, Pre&s;ton, Braforton, Skirmingham, the Burdons, Haughton and Darling|ton, and there finallie meeting with the <HI>Cocke-becke</HI> or <HI>Dare,</HI> it falleth in the The&s;e beneath Stapleton before it come at Croft&s;bridge, and (as it &s;hould &s;eeme) is the &s;ame which Leland calleth Gretteie or Grettie. From thence it runneth to Sockburne, nether Dun&s;leie, Middleton-row, New&s;ham, Yarne (cro&s;&s;ing a brooke from Levenbridge) called <HI>Levin,</HI> or <HI>Leuinus</HI> in Latin, who&s;e crinkling cour&s;e is notable, and the &s;treame of &s;ome called <HI>Thorpe.</HI> After this the The&s;e ha&s;teth on to Barwic, Pre&s;ton, Thorne abbeie, and Ar&s;ham, which &s;tandeth on the &s;outhea&s;t &s;ide of the river almo&s;t betwene the falles of two waters, whereof one de&s;cendeth from We&s;t Hartburne, by Long Newton, Elton, and Stockton; the other from Stillington or Shillington, by Whitton, Thorpe, Blacke&s;ton, Billingham, and Norton. From Ar&s;ham finallie it goeth to Bella&s;is, Middleburgh, and &s;o into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Ptolomie writing of the WERE, calleth it VEDRA. It ri&s;eth of three heads in Kelloppe&s;law-hill, whereof the mo&s;t &s;outherlie is called <HI>Burdop,</HI> the middlemo&s;t <HI>Wallop,</HI> and the northerlie&s;t <HI>Kellop,</HI> which uniting them|&s;elves about St Johns chappell, or a little by we&s;t thereof, their confluence runneth through Stanhope-parke, by ea&s;t Yate, and &s;o to Fro&s;terlie. But yer it come there, it receiveth three rilles from the north in Weredale, whereof one cometh in by Stanhope, another we&s;t of Woodcroft-hall, and the third at Fro&s;terlie aforemen|tioned; and a little beneath the&s;e, a fourth on the &s;outh&s;ide, which de&s;cendeth from &s;outhwe&s;t by Bolliop, Bi&s;hop-&s;leie, Millhou&s;es, and Landew. Being therefore united all with the Were, this &s;tream goeth on to Wol&s;ingham, there taking in the <HI>Wa&s;cropburne,</HI> be&s;ide another at Bradleie, the third at Harpleie-hall (and the&s;e on the north&s;ide) and the fourth, betweene Witton and Witton ca&s;tell, called <HI>Bedburne,</HI> comming by Ham&s;terleie, whereby this river doth now wax verie great. Going therefore from hence, it ha&s;teth to Bi&s;hop's Akeland&punc; and beneath it receiveth the <HI>Garondle&s;&s;e,</HI> which ri&s;eth &s;ix miles by we&s;t of Akeland ca&s;tell, and running &s;outh thereof, pa&s;&s;eth by We&s;t-Akeland, St Helens Akeland, St Andrewes Akeland, and Bi&s;hops Akeland, and then into the Were, which goeth to Newfield and Willington. Neere unto this place al&s;o, and &s;omewhat beneath Sunderland, the Were cro&s;&s;eth one brooke from &s;outhwe&s;t by Het, Cox&s;eie, Cornefurth, Tur&s;dale, and Croxdale, and two other from by northwe&s;t in one botome, whereof the fir&s;t commeth from above A&s;h, by Langleie. The other, called <HI>Coue,</HI> from above Kinchleie, by Newbiggin, Lanche&s;ter, North Langley, and through Beareparke, and &s;o meeting beneath Kelleie or Hedleie with the other, they fall both as one into the Were, betwene South Sunderland and Burnall. From hence our river goeth on to Howgh|well, Shirkeleie, Old Dure&s;me, and there taking in the <HI>Pidding-brooke</HI> by northea&s;t, it goeth to Dure&s;me, Finkeleie, Harbarhou&s;e, Lumleie ca&s;tell, (where it meeteth with the <HI>Pilis,</HI> who&s;e heads are united betwene Pelton and Whitwell, and after called Hedleie) and from thence to Lampton. Harraton, the Beddikes, Uf|ferton, Hilton-parke, Bi&s;hops Weremouth, and &s;o into the &s;ea betwene North Sunderland and North Weremouth towne, which now is called Monke Weremouth.</P></NOTE>, both abounding with fi&s;h, and particularly with trout and &s;almon.</P>

</FIGURE> THE HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES OF THE COUNTY PALATINE OF <HI>DURHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE city of Durham claims our fir&s;t attention. It is in Ea&s;ington ward, and lies near the centre of the county, in latitude 54&deg; 50&prime;, and 1&deg; 27&prime; we&s;t lon|gitude from London. From whatever quarter the traveller approaches this place, he is &s;truck with its elegant &s;ituation, and the grandeur of &s;ome of its public build|ings. A few paces from the &s;outh road, this Engli&s;h Zion makes a noble appear|ance. In the centre, the ca&s;tle and cathedral crown a very lofty eminence, girt by the two &s;treets called the Baileys, enclo&s;ed with the remains of the ancient city walls, and &s;kirted with hanging gardens and plantations which de&s;cend to the river Were, in this point of view exhibiting the figure of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This reverend aged abbey is &s;eated in the heart of the citty, advanced upon the &s;houlders of an high hill, and encompa&s;&s;ed againe with the higher hills, that he that hath &s;eene the &s;ituation of this citty, hath &s;eene the map of Sion, and may &s;ave a journey to the Jeru&s;alem. Shee is girded almo&s;t rownd with the renowned river of Weer, in which, as in a gla&s;&s;e of cry&s;tall, &s;hee might once have beheld the beauty, but nowe the ruine of her walls.&mdash;<BIBL>Legend of St Cuthbert.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. To form the right wing of this picture&s;que pro&s;pect, the banks on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river are high, rocky, &s;teep, and &s;cattered over with trees; along the brink of which the
<PB N="2" REF="11">
&s;treet of New-Elvet is extended, and terminated by the hand&s;ome church of St O&s;wald: At the bottom runs Old-Elvet. Acro&s;s the bridge are the &s;treets of Claypeth and St Giles, which climb the more di&s;tant eminence, the church termi|nating the line of buildings. The &s;lopes of the hills are beautified with hanging gardens and rich meadows. Newton-Hall, one of the &s;eats of Sir Henry Liddell, bart. with its adjacent plantations, fills the nearer back-ground; behind which a fine cultivated country is di&s;covered, lengthening the pro&s;pect to the di&s;tance of ten miles, on which Pen&s;har-Hill, with its peaked brow, is a beautiful object. To form the left wing, the banks oppo&s;ite to the ca&s;tle and cathedral are cloathed with wood and fruit-trees; and South-&s;treet &s;tretches along the &s;ummit. The long canal which the river exhibits to the eye in this part, is cro&s;&s;ed by Framwelgate bridge, of two eliptic arches. Crook-Hall, a &s;eat of one of the family of Hopper, is &s;een on the river's banks, with the woodlands of Newton-Hall on the more di&s;|tant ground; to the left of which the &s;weet villa of Francis John&s;on, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> at Aykley-Heads, is &s;een, &s;urrounded with irregular mounts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here, it is alledged, was a dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lical grove: The b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrow is now very con&s;picuous, and re&s;embling tho&s;e given by Stu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> and ri&s;ing plantations.</P>
<P>Approaching the city from the north, it has the mo&s;t romantic and uncommon appearance: It &s;eems to be &s;cattered over a multitude of irregular hills, (for the ground by which it is approached is thrown up into round mounts), and we di&s;co|ver various parts of the town, the ca&s;tle, and churches, through &s;everal vallies in one point of view, &s;o that they appear like &s;o many di&s;tinct places. The we&s;t front of the ca&s;tle is &s;een on the &s;ummit of a ragged and &s;teep rock, with &s;ome parts of the cathedral; and the &s;treet of St Giles, as if totally unconnected with the re&s;t of the town, is &s;pread over the brow of a di&s;tant eminence. The hollow pa&s;&s;es among&s;t the hills on the north-we&s;t of the city, afford beautiful and picture&s;que pro&s;pects. At Ca&s;tle-Chair, where the view is much confined, the ca&s;tle and ca|thedral have a noble appearance; the octagon tower of the former, with the mound on which it is placed, have a grand effect. On the eminence oppo&s;ite to Shaw-Wood, the view ju&s;t mentioned is enlarged; yet, the di&s;tant branches of the town being intercepted by ri&s;ing grounds, leave the principal objects in the mo&s;t di&s;tinct and picture&s;que arrangement. Approaching from the ea&s;t down the &s;treet of St Giles, we command the &s;econd noble&s;t view of the city: In front, the river Were forms a fine canal through a rich vale, cro&s;&s;ed by Elvet bridge, of &s;even wet arches, and many other land arches; the town crowds the &s;wift ri&s;ings of the hill, pile upon pile; the ca&s;tle and cathedral church crowning the &s;ummit of the eminence. To the left are &s;een the banks of Elvet and the church, flanked by a di&s;tant fore&s;t of oaks, and the groves which hang on the margin of the river: On the right is a view of Newton-Hall, and the adjacent grounds.&mdash;To this general de&s;cription, more mi|nute particulars will be added as we pa&s;s through the city.</P>
<P>A &s;hort view of hi&s;torical facts relative to this place, as each circum&s;tance aro&s;e in the re&s;pective aeras of our prelates, is given in due order in the preceding vo|lume of this work. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t mention as to time, made by old writers of the name of Durham (or Dure&s;me according to the language of tho&s;e days) is by Hollin&s;hed, in the reign of Athel&s;tan, when, &s;peaking of Sithric's

<P>We have not the lea&s;t evidence of any town where Durham now &s;tands, before the monks re&s;ted with the remains of St Cuthbert, after the Dani&s;h inva&s;ion. It was al&s;o remarked in the cour&s;e of this work, that there is a place adjacent to the pre&s;ent city called Old Durham; but we have neither traces in hi&s;tory nor records to &s;hew that any town exi&s;ted there previous to St Cuthbert's arrival. The legendary tale, alone &s;upported by the effigies on the north-we&s;t tower of the tran&s;ept of the cathe|dral church, (which will be de&s;cribed when that edifice is treated of) relates, that after the revelation or vi&s;ion at <HI>Wedelau,</HI> according to Symeon's text, but <HI>Werdele</HI> by others, and de&s;cribed to lie ea&s;t of Durham, the monks were much at a lo&s;s to find the place pointed out by the oracle, where they &s;hould re&s;t from their labour: The name of <HI>Dunholme,</HI> then &s;aid to be given them, was not known to any. If they then lay at <HI>Warden Law,</HI> (which from much &s;imilarity of name &s;ome have conceived was the place of the vi&s;ion) it was within eight miles; if on the banks of the Were, (where we &s;hall by &s;ome ob&s;ervations attempt to ground a &s;uppo&s;ition that the monks halted) it was to the ea&s;t of the city, at a very little di&s;tance; for that river from its &s;ource flows almo&s;t due ea&s;t to Bi&s;hop-Auckland, and from thence almo&s;t due north to Old Durham. It would have been &s;trange if <HI>Deiraham, Dure&s;me,</HI> or <HI>Dunholme,</HI> a place named from the kingdom of Deira in which it was &s;ituated, or &s;ome &s;uch memorable di&s;tinction, had then &s;tood on the &s;cite of Old Durham, and was not known to the inhabitants within &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance as Che&s;ter, the la&s;t re&s;idence of the monks. The di&s;covery of the place of their de&s;tination occurred to the wander|ers accidentally, as the legend relates; for whil&s;t they travelled through the country with uncertain &s;teps, a woman, &s;eeking her cow, was informed by a per&s;on &s;he met that &s;he would find it in <HI>Dunholme:</HI> The a&s;toni&s;hed monks rejoiced at the propitious voice, and followed their fortunate guide, where indeed they found a country flow|ing with milk and honey. So much for the legend; which we would not have troubled the reader with, but it leads to an argument, that the effigies on the church were placed there in commemoration of the happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rich meads and vallies on the Were, which could not be more aptly expre&s;&s;ed in emblem than by the figure of the bountiful cow di&s;tending her udder to di&s;pen&s;e charitable gifts to mankind: It was emblematical of the rich country they had obtained, of the gra|cious gifts of Providence decreed to them, and the holy benevolence of the church. In pur&s;uance of this idea, it is probable the monks, on di&s;covering their de&s;tin|ed re&s;idence with the pious ho&s;t which accompanied them, &s;at down on the plains

It doth not appear that any habitations were erected for the people on the mount where the church was built, for a con&s;iderable time after their com|ing to Dunholme; for we are told, in the cour&s;e of three years from the date of the fir&s;t tabernacle, that a church of &s;tone-work was begun and dedicated by bi&s;hop Aldun, wherein the &s;aint's remains were depo&s;ited. According to the cour&s;e of events exhibited by the ancient writers, it was not till after the foundation of Al|dun's church was laid; that the fore&s;t which grew round the eminence was cut down, and the &s;kirts of the hill were rendered &s;it for human habitation. Much labour was expended; and all the inhabitants between Coquet and Tees rivers, at the command of the earl of Northumberland, are &s;aid to have been employed there|in; workmen drawn from a tract of country not le&s;s than fifty miles in length: Such was the mighty concour&s;e which on that occa&s;ion crowded the banks of the Were <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The topography of <HI>Dunholme</HI> at that tyme was, that it was more beholding to nature for fortification than fertilitie; where thick woods both hindred the &s;tarres from viewing the earth, and the earth from the pro&s;pect of heaven. Here the monkes, with extemporary devotion, in&s;tead of a church, built an arbour of boughs for <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> and from thence tran&s;lated it into <HI>Whitkyrk</HI> (for three years); while <HI>Aldwinus</HI> the bi&s;hop rai&s;ed no &s;mall building of &s;tone worke for his cathedral church, where all the people betweene <HI>Co|qued</HI> and <HI>Tees</HI> three years were at worke, and were paid for their paynes with trea&s;ure in heaven, than which there was never a dearer or cheaper way to build churches.

<P>We hear nothing further of the town of Durham till the year 1040, when, &s;ome authors &s;ay, it was attacked by Duncan of Scotland; and it &s;eems there were then fortifications, for the town&s;men, as reported, &s;u&s;tained the invaders a&s;&s;aults for a long time, and at length made a victorious &s;ally, whereby the enemy were totally routed. The heads of &s;uch Scots leaders as fell or were taken pri&s;oners, were &s;ix|ed on poles round the market-place. The eminence cho&s;en for the fir&s;t build|ings was &s;o &s;teep on every &s;ide but one, that it was ea&s;ily defended again&s;t the at|tacks of an enemy: The weake&s;t part was on the north-ea&s;t, where Claypeth, or Clayport-gate, now &s;tands, being on the neck of land between the &s;treams of the river: This neck, from brink to brink of the Were, is not much above 200 paces in width in its pre&s;ent &s;tate; and there are &s;ufficient appearances on the adjacent ground to encourage a conjecture, that a &s;luice or moat cro&s;&s;ed this narrow part, whereby the whole city could on occa&s;ion be compleatly in&s;ulated. The name of <HI>Clayport,</HI> as it is &s;tiled in all the ancient writers, appears to be a corruption of <HI>Cluer|port,</HI> or the gate of the &s;luice; <HI>cleur</HI> being a north-country word, in acceptation for a &s;luice-gate or &s;luice-board, by which a dam-head is &s;topped. Leland, who vi&s;ited this country, in his Itinerary &s;ays <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in. vol. i. p. 81.</NOTE>, <Q>The towne &s;elf of Dure&s;me &s;tondith on a

Symeon, who gives us the account of the before-mentioned attack on Durham, takes no notice of any fort or &s;trong-hold which contributed to the gallant defence of the inhabitants; but it is probable the mound on which the octagonal tower of the ca&s;tle &s;tands, was cotemporary with the church, and perhaps formed of the &s;oil, which was nece&s;&s;arily moved when the foundations of that &s;tructure were laid. At Warwick there is a mound of the &s;ame form, with terraces &s;imilar to tho&s;e at Durham; and Dugdale <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warwick&s;hire, p. 308.</NOTE> tells us, <Q>If it was pre&s;umption to carry its antiquity higher, to refer the foundation thereof to the renowned lady Ethel&s;tede, daughter of king Alfred, and lady of the Mercians, I am &s;ure will not, in regard it appears, that &s;he in 915 (&s;cil. in the 16th year of king Edward the Elder) cau&s;ed the dungeon to be made, which is a &s;trong tower or platform, upon a large and high mount of earth, artificially rai&s;ed (&s;uch being u&s;ually placed towards the &s;ide of a ca&s;tle or fort, which is lea&s;t defen&s;ible) the &s;ub&s;tance whereof is yet to be &s;een.</Q> This pa&s;&s;age is quoted, to &s;hew the reader there was an example for the people to follow, and that &s;uch mounts were of that antiquity. It is &s;aid to be the opinion of the ingenious Mr Wright, of Byers-green<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Author of Louthiania.</NOTE>, that this was a Dani&s;h mount or fort; but we have no traces in hi&s;tory of that peo|ple having a re&s;idence here; and indeed the former arguments hold again&s;t it, as &s;uch a work would have rendered the place notorious to the monks of Che&s;ter, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles.</P>
<P>The next event noted in hi&s;tory, wherein Durham is di&s;tingui&s;hed, was in the year 1069, after the coming in of William the Norman, when he &s;ent down Cu|min as governor of Northumberland with a guard of 700 veteran Norman &s;oldiers. De&s;pi&s;ing bi&s;hop Egelwin's caution and advice, Cumin entered the city with marks of cruelty and tyranny, and through the in&s;olence of his own &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, per|mitted his troops to give them&s;elves up to rioting and wantonne&s;s; they forcibly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;es, were di&s;per&s;ed through every quarter of the city, and committed various enormities again&s;t the inhabitants. The Normans, overcome with drunkenne&s;s and revelling, were totally off their guard; whil&s;t the people of the adjacent country, arming them&s;elves, a&s;&s;embled in the night, and at the dawn of day forced the gates of the city, fell upon the Normans when they &s;u&s;|pected no violence, and put them to the &s;word; &s;o that the &s;treets were filled with blood and carca&s;es, the hou&s;e where the earl lodged was &s;et on fire, and tho&s;e within endeavouring to fly were immediately &s;lain, only one wounded per&s;on

When the ruthle&s;s tyrant William, greedy of revenge, marched his army northward, the affrighted inhabitants of Durham fled the city <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camd.

As &s;oon as the troops retired, the inhabitants came from their hiding places, and the religious ho&s;t brought back their holy charge after an ab&s;ence of four months.</P>
<P>The king having appointed Walcher to the bi&s;hopric, on his return from an ex|pedition again&s;t Malcolm of Scotland in 1072, ordered a ca&s;tle or fortre&s;s to be built at Durham, at once to protect the bi&s;hop and his convent, to keep the peo|ple in &s;ubjection, and to awe the northern territories, this place being e&s;teemed a fit &s;ituation for a barrier. It is certain &s;uch an edifice was begun about that period of time; but we have no information of what form it was, though the oc|tagonal figure is not unu&s;ual in the Norman buildings. It &s;eems, Camden appre|hended the ca&s;tle directed to be built by William was not founded on the &s;cite of any ancient fortre&s;s, his words being <HI>in eminentiori collis parte extruxit;</HI> but that a more elevated &s;ituation was cho&s;en for the new bulwark than the &s;tronghold al|luded to by Gulielmus Gemiticencis, who&s;e words he quotes, de&s;cribing the for|tre&s;s: <Q>From whence (he &s;ays) the Engli&s;h, di&s;&s;atisfied with the Norman yoke, made frequent &s;allies, and kept them&s;elves clo&s;e there, waiting for the expected approach of the Danes; that it was in a part of the country inacce&s;&s;ible by rea&s;on of woods and waters; that it had a &s;trong rampier round it, which they called Dunholme.</Q> This account &s;eems to &s;trengthen the former arguments. William de Malm&s;bury, whom Camden quotes, and who lived about that time, gives us this de&s;cription of the city: <Q>Durham is a hill ri&s;ing gradually from out the valley to its &s;ummit; and notwith&s;tanding, by its rugged &s;ituation and bro|ken rocks, all acce&s;s for an enemy is cut off, yet lately they have built a ca&s;tle upon a hill, at who&s;e foot runs an excellent river.</Q> Dugdale, further &s;peaking of the ca&s;tle of Warwick, &s;ays, <Q>In tho&s;e days (in the Saxons time I mean) were very few &s;uch defen&s;ible places as we now call ca&s;tles, that being a French name; &s;o that though the Engli&s;h were a bold and warlike people, yet, for want of the like &s;trongholds, were they much le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t their enemies, which defect gave great advantage to the Norman conqueror after his victory at Ha&s;t|ings; whereof he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that he neglected not to rai&s;e &s;tore of &s;uch forts through the whole realm, as I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, among&s;t which this at Warwick was not the lea&s;t.</Q></P>

<P>In 1424 this city was crowded with the nobility of England and Scotland, on the liberation of the Scotch king, and his marriage with the lady Jane Seymour; the ho&s;tages were received here; a truce for &s;even years was al&s;o then &s;ettled be|tween the two nations; and certain laws e&s;tabli&s;hed for the government of the bor|ders: The king and queen of Scotland remained at Durham a con&s;iderable time, not departing thence until the la&s;t day of March or fir&s;t of April.</P>

<P>In the time of bi&s;hop Nevill, this city was the place of many conventions of the delegates of England and Scotland. In 1448, Henry VI. came here on a Pilgrim|age to the &s;hrine of St Cuthbert. In 1463, lord Montague was at Durham with his army, previous to the battle of Hedgley-Moor.</P>

In the year 1589 the plague again broke out and raged in Durham for a con&s;iderable time: After abat|ing for &s;ome months, which gave hopes that the tremendous vi&s;itation was about to cea&s;e, it appeared again in 1597 with redoubled violence, &s;o as to oblige the poorer people to be removed into huts and &s;heds on the adjacent commons, parti|cularly Elvet-Moor, where the marks of arrangement of melancholy cells were di&s;|tinctly to be ob&s;erved, before the late inclo&s;ures, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the hill, be|low the wood.

In 1633, Charles I. was re&s;ident at Durham a con&s;iderable time with bi&s;hop Morton, who entertained him and his whole retinue, at the expence of 1500l. a day.</P>

<P>Pope Alexander III. was elected 6th Sept. 1159, and died in 1181, having reigned 21 years, 11 month and 22 days.</P>
<P>The &s;eal to the confirmation is of lead, appendant by a yellow and crim&s;on &s;ilk &s;tring.

Whereas the city of Durham in the county palatine of Durham is, and time out of mind hath been, an ancient city, of good fame. And the burge&s;&s;es, men

as by virtue of divers charters, grants, and confirmations, as well from us, as &s;everal of our predece&s;&s;ors, bi&s;hops of Durham. And the bur|ge&s;&s;es,
<PB N="27" REF="37">
men and inhabitants in time pa&s;t, have &s;uffered great damage, by rea&s;on of the defect of &s;ome of the &s;aid charters; and fearing le&s;t in time to come they

&s;hould be mole&s;ted in the enjoyment of &s;uch their liberties and free cu&s;toms, for want of publication, and other cau&s;es; they have therefore humbly entreated us to expre&s;s, in &s;pecial words, what the &s;aid liberties and free cu&s;toms are, and to grant the &s;ame to the &s;aid burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and to incorporate them,</Q> &amp;c. By this charter he con&s;tituted and granted, that the burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants &s;hould be one body politic and corporate, con&s;i&s;ting of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and commonalty, to continue for ever, by the name of

mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of Durham and Framwelgate, and by that title to plead and be impleaded in all courts of law within the county, with power to purcha&s;e lands not exceeding the yearly value of 100 marks, and to have a common &s;eal. Hugh Wright was therein appointed the fir&s;t mayor, to con|tinue in office till the 4th day of October then next following, and then to be an alderman for life, to &s;upply the number of twelve without any new election. Robt Sureties, Rich. Hutchin&s;on, Edw. Wanles, Wm Hall, Ja. Farales, Tho. Pear&s;on, John Wall, Edw. Taylor, Hugh Hutchin&s;on, John Heighington, John Pattin&s;on, and Richard Wright, were appointed aldermen for life. They were directed to chu&s;e yearly twenty-four di&s;creet men out of their &s;everal twelve arts, my&s;teries, or trades, that is to &s;ay, two out of the mercers, grocers, haberda&s;hers, ironmongers, and &s;alters; two of the drapers and taylors, two of the &s;kinners and glovers, two of the tanners, two of the weavers, two of the dyers and fullers, two of the cordwainers, two of the &s;addlers, two of the butchers, two of the &s;miths, two of the carpenters and joiners, two of the free ma&s;ons and rough ma&s;ons, inhabitants of the city and Framwelgate, which, with the mayor and aldermen, &s;hould form a common council for the &s;aid city, and, on the 4th day of October yearly, to chu&s;e a mayor out of the body of the &s;aid aldermen, it being requi&s;ite to have &s;even aldermen in the majority of votes on that occa&s;ion, with a power for a like majority to deprive or &s;u&s;pend the mayor for any offence committed in his office; and on &s;uch occa&s;ion, or on the death of the mayor, another chief magi&s;trate &s;hould be in like manner elected, with|in eleven days from the time of &s;uch deprivation, to &s;upply that year; and within three days after &s;uch election, to be &s;worn before the bi&s;hop for the time being, or, on the See being vacant, or the bi&s;hop being in di&s;tant parts, then before the chan|cellor of the county palatine, or, on his ab&s;ence out of the juri&s;diction, before the aldermen and the twenty-four common-councilmen, or the major part of them. On the fifth day of October, yearly, the &s;aid mayor, aldermen, and common coun|cil are directed to chu&s;e two &s;erjeants. On the death of a common councilman, the mayor and aldermen, within twenty days, are to nominate one in his &s;tead, out of the &s;ame trade; and on the vacancy of an alderman within the &s;ame time, to nominate another out of the burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants of the &s;aid city and Fram|welgate. Any per&s;on elected mayor or alderman, and refu&s;ing to take upon him the office, is made &s;ubject to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, to be levied on the de&s;aulter's goods and chattles, or committed to the gaol at Durham till the &s;ame is paid; and &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ines to be applied to the public u&s;e of the city. They were al&s;o authorized to make laws, &s;tatutes, and ordinances, for the better govern|ment of the city, and the markets and fairs therein, and all officers, my&s;teries, arti|ficers and inhabitants, and for regulating their &s;everal trades and my&s;teries; and the due pre&s;ervation and management of the lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;aid body corporate.

<P>This ca&s;e was &s;et down in the crown paper as a &s;pecial verdict, and was &s;o called and argued by one coun|cil on each &s;ide, in the &s;ame manner as if it had been a &s;pecial verdict: But it was only a verdict on &s;ix &s;e|veral traver&s;es to the return of a mandamus (on 9 Ann, c. 20) directed to the mayor of Durham, command|ing him to &s;wear and admit Robert Green into the place and office of a freeman of the company or frater|nity of freema&s;ons of the city of Durham.</P>
<P>The right &s;et up by Robert Green was, his having been duly elected and admitted a freeman of the com|pany; but the objection to his being &s;worn by the mayor was, "that he had not conformed to certain bye-laws particularly &s;pecified in the return, and found by the verdict."</P>
<P>The return was, That Durham is, and for time immemorial hath been, an ancient city, &amp;c. and al&s;o that a power is given by a charter of Tobias, then bi&s;hop of Durham, in 44 Eliz. confirmed by James I. to the mayor, aldermen, and common council for the time being, or the major part of them (of whom the mayor and &s;ix of the aldermen to be &s;even) to make bye-laws in the &s;tead, for, and in the name of the whole corpo|rate body of the city of Durham and Framwelgate.</P>

<P>This ca&s;e was argued on the 24th of Nov. 1756, by Mr Ambler for the plaintiff, and Mr Clayton for the defendant; when the court ordered it to &s;tand for judgment to the then next term: And lord Mansfield then delivered the re&s;olution of the court&mdash;The general que&s;tion depends upon Robert Green's right to the franchi&s;e which he claims&mdash;The objection to his right ari&s;es from his not being qualified according to the bye-law&mdash;If the bye-law is good and binding, and he appears to be an object of it, he is certainly not quali|fied, and the mayor has returned a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for not admitting and &s;wearing him&mdash;All the objections which have been made, therefore, tend to &s;et a&s;ide the bye-law; or if the bye-law be good, to &s;hew that Green's ca&s;e is not within it.&mdash;It has been argued, that the bye-law is void upon two grounds; 1&s;t, for want of authority to make it; 2dly, from the &s;ubject matter.&mdash;As to the fir&s;t, the objection is, that the bye-laws are returned to be made by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty; whereas the power is given to the mayor, aldermen, and twenty-four common-council, or the major part of them, of whom the mayor and &s;ix alder|men &s;hould be &s;even.&mdash;ANSWER. The power to the &s;elect number is, "To make bye-laws in the &s;tead, for, and in the name of the whole corporate body." The&s;e bye-laws might be made by the &s;elect number, acting in the name of the whole incorporate body, and mu&s;t be &s;o intended: For the jury find, "That they did in due manner meet, and in due manner make the bye-laws."&mdash;As to the &s;econd, That the bye-law is unrea&s;onable and void: For it is likened to the ca&s;e of the taylors of Ip&s;wich, (2. Co 53.) a bye-law that none &s;hould work at his trade until he had pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the company of taylors, and proved that he had &s;erved &s;even years as an apprentice, and admitted by them to be a &s;ufficient workman.&mdash; ANSW. In that ca&s;e the bye-law was again&s;t law; it was again&s;t the 5th of Eliz. and a further re&s;traint than that act made.&mdash;But this bye-law is not again&s;t any law; it is not a re&s;traint upon trade, but &s;eems a rea&s;onable re|gulation, to prevent per&s;ons being unduly made free, who are not entitled by birth-right, &s;ervice, or pur|cha&s;e; it provides a method for previou&s;ly examining into the right of tho&s;e who claim to be made free.&mdash; OBJECTION. That there is no method to compel a meeting of the mayor, alderman or aldermen, and the wardens and &s;tewards of companies.&mdash; ANSW. This objection extends equally to all corporate a&s;&s;emblies, by cu&s;tom, charter, or bye-law; but there is a known method by Mandamus.&mdash;OBJECT. If a per&s;on has a right to be admitted a freeman, yet unle&s;s he be approved of by the mayor, &amp;c. he is not to be admitted; and there is no method to compel them to approve.&mdash;ANSW. If the mayor, &amp;c. di&s;approve without a cau&s;e, a Mandamus will lie, &s;ugge&s;ting the qualification and right of the per&s;on claiming to be a freeman, and com|manding the mayor to approve and admit. But &s;uppo&s;ing the bye-law good, it has been argued that this ca&s;e is not within it.&mdash;1&s;t OBJECT. The Mandamus is to admit Green to the freedom of the company; the bye-law relates only to the freedom of the city.&mdash;ANSW. It appears by the &s;econd bye-law to be the &s;ame thing.&mdash;2d OBJECT. The bye-law prohibits, indeed, the election of per&s;ons not called and approved, &amp;c. and &s;ubjects di&s;obedience to a penalty; but does not make the election void, and cannot transfer the right of election ve&s;ted in the electors to the mayor. &mdash;ANSW. The&s;e objections are &s;ounded upon a mi&s;un|der&s;tanding of the bye-law, and a mi&s;conception of the nature of the ca&s;e. The writ recites "That Green had been duly elected and admitted a freeman," and therefore commands the mayor to &s;wear him&mdash;The mayor returns the bye law, &amp;c and that before Green's &s;uppo&s;ed election and admittance (by the company) to be a freeman, "he was not called and approved by the mayor, &amp;c." And the fact found by the jury is&punc;

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="35" REF="47">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="36" REF="48">"That he was elected and admitted by the company, but not called and approved by the mayor, &amp;c." So that it appears upon this record, that the intent of the bye-law was, that no per&s;on &s;hould be elected and admitted a freeman of the company, unle&s;s he was called at the a&s;&s;embly and approved, &amp;c. which was a previous act to be done, before the company could elect him,&mdash;the way to prevent the abu&s;e "That the company unduly admitted per&s;ons to their freedom." The &s;econd bye-law inflicts a penalty on the com|pany who &s;hould make any one free without the previous calling and approbation. And the third bye-law inflicts a penalty on the mayor who &s;hould &s;wear any &s;uch per&s;on.&mdash;The &s;tating the fact an&s;wers both the ob|jections: For the bye-law makes the appearance and approbation a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to the being made free by the company; and a re&s;traint upon them, to elect any one to his freedom, before his con|forming to the bye-law: And the right of election is not transferred to the mayor, but remains where it was.&mdash;OBJECT. It is not returned, that there was any a&s;&s;embly, at which Green might appear to be called.&mdash;ANSW. It &s;hall be intended: And if in fact there was no a&s;&s;embly, Green might have pleaded it excu&s;e.&mdash;OBJECT. He might have been elected and admitted before the making this bye-law.&mdash;ANS. The jury have found, "That he was elected and admitted; but that he was not called and approved pur&s;uant to the bye-law:" So that the bye-law was in being at the time of his election.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that it is not &s;tated, what is the method of the company's electing freemen, nor any thing in the charter concerning it. For aught that appears, the fir&s;t bye-law may be agreeable to the an|cient u&s;age, and revived by this bye-law, and enforced by penalties. But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be introductory of a previous qualification, it &s;eems to be rea&s;onable, and well calculated to prevent improper per&s;ons, not entitled, being made free. It is much more rea&s;onable than the cu&s;tom of London, "that no broad cloth &s;hould be &s;old but what was brought to Blackwell-Hall to be examined," 5. Co. 62. Yet this cu&s;tom was held good, becau&s;e it was to prevent fraud.</P>
<P>We are of opinion, that none of the objections are well &s;ounded, and, therefore, that the return ought to be allowed.&mdash;Con&s;equently, as this was the ca&s;e of traver&s;ing the return to a Mandamu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, pur&s;uant to the &s;tat. 9 Ann, cap. 20. the rule was taken, <HI>That judgment be entered for the defendant.</HI></P>

<P>THAT by charter formerly granted by Tobias Matthew, bi&s;hop of Durham, in the reign of the late queen Elizabeth, the commonalty of the city of Durham were incorporated, and were made to con&s;i&s;t of three in|tegral parts, viz. a mayor, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common councilmen, who by the &s;aid charter were inve&s;ted with divers powers and authorities, and particularly a power was by the &s;aid charter given to the &s;aid mayor and aldermen, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;olely of choo&s;ing and electing two &s;uch per&s;ons from each of the twelve trades therein named, as they &s;hould think proper, who were to be of the common coun|cil of the &s;aid city, together and along with the &s;aid mayor and aldermen.</P>

<P>And your petitioners further humbly &s;hew unto your lord&s;hip, that they have been informed that a peti|tion has already been pre&s;ented, or is intended to be pre&s;ented to your lord&s;hip for a new charter, &s;ub&s;cribed only by a &s;mall part of the body of freemen of and belonging to the &s;aid city, many of whom not knowing the purport or meaning thereof, were induced to &s;ign the &s;ame, but being &s;ince more rightly informed, are now very de&s;irous that the &s;aid petition &s;hould be retracted and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>Extracts from the report of James Wallace, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> the bi&s;hop's attorney-general, dated <DATE>7th Aug. <HI>1773.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>The title of &s;ome of the aldermen was di&s;puted upon the grounds of their not being inhabitants within Durham or Framwelgate at the time of their elections, which is a qualification required by the charter, and had been di&s;regarded in the election of aldermen in a variety of in&s;tances at different periods. Informations in the nature of quo warranto were filed in the court of King's Bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, again&s;t the earl of Darlington, the hon. Frederick Vane, John Tempe&s;t, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> Ra. Bow&s;er, and John Hopper, who were removed from their office of aldermen either by judgment of ou&s;ter or di&s;claimer, and the hon. Gilbert Vane re&s;igned his office.</P>
<P>The election of the common-council on the 3d of Oct. 1766, was attended with di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and mi&s;takes and irregularities were then committed in the choice of &s;ome of them, which in their con&s;e|quences affected the title of Mr John Lambe in the office of mayor, to which he was elected the day follow|ing; and on an information in the nature of quo warranto, judgment was obtained again&s;t him for exerci&s;ing the office of mayor under that election, and from that time there has not been any legal mayor.</P>
<P>By the means before &s;tated, and by the natural deaths of Mr Tho. Horn&s;by and Mr Jo&s;. Gray, the al|dermen are reduced to four, namely, Mr Tho. Dunn re&s;iding in Elvet, Mr Tho. Bainbridge re&s;iding in Stock|ton, Mr John Drake Bainbridge re&s;iding at Durham, Mr Benj. Whitaker re&s;iding in America and not likely to return, and who before his departure &s;ignified his intention to re&s;ign his office of alderman.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, the powers and authorities ve&s;ted in the corporation are &s;u&s;pended; and as the charter made a greater number of aldermen than at pre&s;ent exi&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the election of a mayor and aldermen, I conceive it is impo&s;&s;ible for the corporation to pre&s;erve or continue it&s;elf by the operation of the &s;tat. of 11th Geo. I. or by any other means.</P>
<P>The expediency of a charter to revive the corporation, is admitted by the petitioners, and cannot be de|nied or doubted. The members of the corporation, and tho&s;e entitled to the privileges and advantages of it, are not the only per&s;ons intere&s;ted: many charities are in the di&s;po&s;al of the corporation, the objects of which t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;en&s;ibly find the benevolent de&s;igns of the founders prevented and fru&s;trated. There are be&s;ides, public rea&s;ons, which render a new charter immediately nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I conceive your lord&s;hip is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>jura regalia</HI> within the county palatine of Durham, &s;ubject to the prohibitions and re&s;trictions contained in the &s;tat. of 27th Hen. VIII. ch. 24. and that the &s;ole power of grant|ing a new charter to the city of Durham and Framwelgate is ve&s;ted in your lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that the old charter &s;hould be the ba&s;is of the new one, and to be departed from in tho&s;e particular provi&s;ions only, which have in experience been found, or probably may be inconvenient to the corporation.</P>
<P>By the old charter, the re&s;idence of an alderman within the city of Durham at the time of his election, is an indi&s;pen&s;ible qualification, &amp;c. If the circuit of the city of Durham and Framwelgate &s;hall not be &s;uf|ficient for the &s;upply of proper per&s;ons to fill the office of aldermen, your lord&s;hip may in the new charter en|large the bounds,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<HEAD>CHARITABLE FUNDS.</HEAD>
<P>"There is a charitable fund belonging to the city of Durham, for which the mayor and aldermen are tru&s;tees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account was taken by Mr Randal from the papers of Mr John Dixon, late of Durham, decea&s;ed, an eminent attorney at law.</NOTE>. Mr Henry Smith, the great benefactor of the city of Durham whil&s;t it &s;tood incorporated by the name of aldermen and bur|ge&s;&s;es, by will dated the 20th of July 1598, gave all his coal-mines, then of the clear yearly value of 100l. be&s;ides a per&s;onal e&s;tate in money, debts, and goods, beyond debts and legacies, worth 600l. unto the city of Durham, in the&s;e words: <Q>And as touching my colemynes, and that the increa&s;e thereof may be employed for the benefit of many, I freely give them all to this city of Durham, and the cau&s;e why I doe &s;oe, and further as followeth is, that &s;ome good trade may be devi&s;ed for &s;etting of the youth and other idle per&s;ons to work, as &s;hall be thought mo&s;t convenient, whereby &s;ome profit may ari&s;e to the benefit of the &s;aid city, and reliefe of tho&s;e that are pa&s;t work.</Q>&mdash;Then he gives away &s;everal legacies, and adds, <Q>All the re&s;t that remaineth I fully give and bequeath to this city of Durham, as fully and amply as I have done my colemynes, and to the u&s;es before expre&s;&s;ed.</Q>&mdash;And then appoints one alderman <HI>pro tempore,</HI> Edward Wanles, dyer, and William Hall, draper, his executors, to &s;ee the &s;aid will per|formed; and died on the 17th of November 1598. Mr Tho. Pier&s;on was alder|man at Mr Smith's death, and, together with Wanles and Hall, entered upon his e&s;tate, and continued the receipt and management thereof, until Tobias Matthew bi&s;hop of Durham, in the year 1602, incorporated the city by the name of mayor and aldermen, and then the &s;ucceeding mayors joined with the two executors, in the receipt and management thereof, and &s;o it continued until the eighth year of K. James I. when a commi&s;&s;ion of pious u&s;es was awarded to William bi&s;hop of Durham, and &s;everal others, upon which an inque&s;t was taken, and this charity found and decreed again&s;t the executors, in who&s;e hands it was, and &s;everal per&s;ons were appointed to be the governors thereof, particularly the then bi&s;hop, Richard Hutton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> his temporal chancellor, H. Dethick, H. Ewbanke, Rob. Cooper, and &s;everal others. Tho&s;e governors (14th Aug. 1612) called the executors to an ac|count, and found in their hands in ready ca&s;h 577l. 10s. 2d. which they received and lodged in the che&s;t in the town chamber, which they had bought for the pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="57" REF="69">
under four locks, and there al&s;o placed the bonds and other &s;ecurities and writings relating to this charity; and then ordered the New-Place <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The palace of the Nevill family.</NOTE> to be bought, for a trade of cloth-working to be &s;et up in, which was accordingly done, and 150l. paid for the purcha&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>In May 1614, Henry Doughty and Wm Ba&s;toe, clothworkers, were employed to begin the work, and were &s;ettled in the New-Place; and one Richard Thomlin|&s;on had by copy of court-roll an a&s;&s;ignment made him of &s;ome ground upon Bra&s;s|&s;ide Moor, <HI>de novo incremento,</HI> and inclo&s;ed it for the benefit of the works, and 200l. was paid them to provide materials, for which &s;um Wm Hall the executor, who had recommended the&s;e three men, was bound.</P>
<P>In September 1614 a new commi&s;&s;ion of pious u&s;es i&s;&s;ued, to the &s;aid bi&s;hop, chancellor Hutton, and &s;everal other commi&s;&s;ioners, who approved of what the go|vernors had done, and ordered 250l. more to be advanced to the clothiers, upon the &s;tatute-merchant of them and two other &s;ureties, relations of Doughty and Ba&s;toe, and upon &s;urrender of Tomlin&s;on's Intack; and &s;o the works went forward for about two years, and then Doughty and his partners broke, and the governors took in one William Atkin&s;on, then ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e of correction, to &s;pin and employ children that way, and gave him 60l. to buy wool: And al&s;o in the year 1616 the governor employed Thomas Browne and George Beecrofte, two new clothworkers, and bought them in wool, and gave them it to work, and employed William Hall the executor to be their in&s;pector; and the work went on but &s;lowly and to no great purpo&s;e, till Jan. 1619, and then was di&s;continued; and in&s;tead thereof, 20l. per annum was ordered to be paid by 5l. per quarter to the &s;everal &s;treets in Durham, and apprentices were ordered to be bound out, ten or more per annum, as the &s;tock &s;hould an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Thus it hath continued ever &s;ince, with the addition only of two half yearly pays more to the poor of the &s;everal &s;treets; and in the year 1622, Wydop Leezes and Redmyers Hou&s;e were purcha&s;ed for 660l. at the yearly rent of 50l. per annum, 3l. 6s. 8d. being di&s;counted for a copyhold rent payable thereout annually to the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>After this the governors put their &s;tatute-merchant in &s;uit again&s;t Doughty and Ba&s;toe's relations, and recovered mo&s;t of the 250l. la&s;t lent; but all that Hall the executor was bound for, and more which he had got into his hands, amounting to 598l. odd money, was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The mayors of Durham, from the di&s;continuing of the la&s;t clothworking in the year 1619 or 20, again received the money ari&s;ing of the &s;tock, and yearly account|ed for it to the governors till the year 1659, and then a trea&s;urer received it; and &s;o it continued during the troubles, and till after the re&s;toration, to wit, in Decem|ber 1669, when a commi&s;&s;ion of pious u&s;es was awarded to bi&s;hop Co&s;in, Dr Sud|bury then dean of Durham, and others, and thereupon an inque&s;t was taken, where|by one John Heighington, who had been mayor of Durham, was found debtor for Smith's charity 414l. and for charities given by others almo&s;t as much more; but all that was got in &s;atisfaction thereof was only the hou&s;e and &s;hop in the market-place,
<PB N="58" REF="70">
in Mrs Fulthorpe and alderman Paxton's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, valued at 18l. per ann. called Heighington's Burgage.</P>
<P>In the year 1659 the receipt of the mayors of Durham was di&s;continued, and a trea&s;urer appointed to receive and pay out the &s;tock as the governors ordered. All the collieries are now failed, and have &s;o been for many years pa&s;t, &s;o that all the &s;tock <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Lin&s;ell bi&s;hop of Hereford and prebendary of Durham gave by will "for the u&s;e of the poor people of the city of Durham 100l. to be placed out at intere&s;t, or lands to be purcha&s;ed therewith."</P>
<P>F. Buney by his will dated 20th Jan. 1626, gave to the city of Durham "20l. to be lent to poor men de|cayed, by five marks a-piece upon good &s;ecurity, to be paid at the year's end."</P>
<P>Mr Walton archdeacon of Derby gave "to the city of Durham 40l. to be lent gratis to poor trade&s;men by 5l. a-piece for four years together."</P>
<P>Dr Hartwell, by will dated 9th March 1724, gave to the corporation of the city of Durham "20l. a-year, to be di&s;po&s;ed of to two merchants or trade&s;men of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, 10l. each, that have &s;erved out their time in the &s;aid city, and want &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;et up with; which per&s;ons the mayor and &s;ix alder|men or more, are unanimou&s;ly to pitch upon, without favour to any but tho&s;e that &s;tand in mo&s;t need of it. And that this benevolence may have its full effect, as de&s;igned by me, it &s;hall be in the power of the mayor and all the re&s;iding aldermen to be&s;tow the whole 20l. on any one per&s;on whom they &s;hall judge in their con|&s;ciences to de&s;erve it, by the narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances. Moreover, the &s;aid 20l. per ann. is not to be paid but to the per&s;on or per&s;ons them&s;elves, cho&s;en by the mayor and aldermen of Durham, according to the limitations herein named, who are to certify their choice under their hands to the tru&s;tees of this part of my la&s;t will and te&s;tament."&mdash;This charity is chargeable on lands at</P>

<HEAD>THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn the government of the city, and privileges of the incorporated body, we beg leave to call the reader's attention to the hi&s;tory and de&s;crip|tion of the cathedral church.</P>
<P>In the preceding volume, under the annals of the bi&s;hops, are &s;hewn the origin and foundation of this rich church, which renders it unnece&s;&s;ary now to revert to many of the facts there &s;tated.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect, that in the fir&s;t in&s;titution this church was &s;erved by &s;ecular clergy, who are &s;aid to have been governed by a provo&s;t. Bi&s;hop Walcher fir&s;t projected a change, intending to introduce regular canons, but did not live to effect his purpo&s;e. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, William de Carilepho, in the year 1083 ac|compli&s;hed that matter, aided by the power of the crown, under the influence of the See of Rome. He applied to pope Gregory the Seventh for his precept or licence, on which he grounded his charter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. notes vol. i. p. 133, where an extract from this charter is given.</NOTE>, thereby declaring he granted the &s;ame by the command and council of the holy See, and that the king was pre&s;ent at the time of making thereof; and ordained, that all future priors of the church at Dur|ham &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the liberties, dignities, and honours of abbots, with the ab|bot's &s;eat in the choir of the church; and to hold all their lands, churches, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their own hands and free di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o as the revenues thereof might thereby be increa&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible, exempted from royal cu&s;toms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. ii. p. 384.&mdash;Wharton's Anglia Sacra, p. 785.&mdash;Dugdale's Mona&s;t. Angl. vol. i. p. 42.</NOTE>. He ob|tained the king's diploma to maintain and &s;upport his charter, dated in the year 1084, e&s;tabli&s;hing the removal of the &s;ecular clergy from his epi&s;copal church, and tran&s;lating thither monks from Jarrow and Weremouth mona&s;teries, who were of the order of St Augu&s;tine; by which in&s;trument the king ordained, that all priors of that mona&s;tery &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame liberties, cu&s;toms, dignities, and honours, as abbots <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. p. 135. for this record.&mdash;Mona&s;t.

By this in&s;trument, the king al&s;o confirmed whatever the bi&s;hop had granted to his convent; and declared his protection of the mona&s;tery and its po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, as well tho&s;e then enjoyed, as whatever &s;hould thereafter be acquired by the money of St Cuthbert or otherwi&s;e, with <HI>&s;ac.</HI> and <HI>&s;ocne, tol</HI> and <HI>team,</HI> and <HI>infangeon|theof,

<P>Not content with &s;olely accompli&s;hing &s;o great a reformation, this prelate gave to the mona&s;tery, Rennington, the two Pittingtons, He&s;&s;elton, Dalton, Merrington, Shincliff, and Elvet; with Willington and Wall's-End north of Tyne, together with the churches of Lindisfarn, the adjacent villages of Fenham, Norham, and Skirworth, with divers churches in York&s;hire; and other donations were added by the king, among which are lands in Kever&s;ton and Gretham.</P>
<P>After the bi&s;hop's return from exile, he furni&s;hed the altar with various ve&s;&s;els and ornaments of gold and &s;ilver, and gave to the convent a large collection of va|luable books <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

It would be an unprofitable labour in this place to note the &s;everal gifts of lands, as the whole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church appear in the endowment after the Reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="75">The bi&s;hop, conceiving the church built by his predece&s;&s;ors was not of &s;uitable magnificence to the dignity and increa&s;ing power of the See, formed a plan for a new erection, &s;imilar to the &s;uperb &s;tructures he had &s;een on the continent; and in the year 1093 he began to erect the &s;tately edifice, now the &s;ubject of our attention. Though the art of making gla&s;s was introduced from France in the beginning of the &s;eventh century, and Eddius, who wrote the life of Wilfrid, and lived about the year 720, a&s;&s;erts, that he glazed the windows of the church of York when he repaired that edifice, yet we have no proofs to maintain the a&s;&s;ertion. It is probable that the u&s;e of gla&s;s prevailed greatly when our prelate began this work. The ori|ginal form of the windows was of the circular arch, &s;imilar to the galleries above the ailes, and they were con&s;tructed for glazing. Gla&s;s windows introduced great embelli&s;hments in public edifices, as the u&s;e of &s;tucco and plai&s;tering &s;ucceeded that improvement; before which the in&s;ides of the walls were regularly chi&s;&s;elled and poli&s;hed; which circum&s;tance has contributed greatly to the permanency of ancient buildings, the in&s;ide &s;urface being as exactly compacted as the out&s;ide. The large windows introduced in this building are apparently of a fa&s;hion and fa|brication more modern than the eleventh century, their pointed arches in nowi&s;e corre&s;ponding with the mode which is adopted through the greate&s;t part of the an|cient edifice, that kind of arch being, as our be&s;t authors agree, introduced &s;ince the reign of Henry II. The annexed plate, taken from as accurate a drawing as perhaps was ever given to the public, will &s;ave much de&s;cription, and convey to the reader the mo&s;t perfect idea of this fabric before the repairs and embelli&s;hments now carrying on were begun. In the plates given in the Mona&s;ticon, the we&s;tern towers are ornamented with &s;pires, which went to decay, and were removed many years ago. In Willis's Cathedrals is a beautiful plate of the north front, dedicated to bi&s;hop Talbot, but the drawing is contracted and inaccurate.</P>
<P>The foundation of the church was laid on the 11th of Aug. 1093, with a &s;olem|nity &s;uited to &s;o great and pious a work, the bi&s;hop being a&s;&s;i&s;ted therein by Mal|colm king of Scotland, and Turgot the prior: But the prelate departing this life in the year 1095<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>1093, 11th Aug.

<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of the cloy&s;ters, was fa&s;tened to the wall at the &s;ide of the cloy&s;ter door, a &s;eat, having four feet and a back of wood, and boarded under foot for warmth: On this the porter was &s;eated, to keep the cloy&s;ter door. The la&s;t porter was Edward Patti&s;on. From the &s;tool we&s;tward, on the &s;outh &s;ide, was a long bench of &s;tone, almo&s;t to the Frater-hou&s;e door, whereon were &s;eated certain children in a row, upon Maunday Thur&s;day, it being intended for that purpo&s;e. The whole convent of monks had each a boy a&s;|&s;igned him, who&s;e feet he was to wa&s;h and dry with a towel, and every monk then ki&s;&s;ed the feet he had wa&s;hed, and gave to each child thirty pence in money, &s;even red herrings, three loaves of bread, and a wa|fer cake, &s;erving every child with drink them&s;elves: This godly ceremony thus ended; after prayers &s;aid by the prior and convent, they all departed in good decorum. At the end of the bench adjoining to the Frater-hou&s;e door, was a fine almery fixed to the wall, and another on the other &s;ide of the door; the fore part of the almeries was through-carved work, to admit air to the towels, and three doors in the fore part of each almery, and a lock on each, to which every monk had a key, to dry their hands with the towels when they wa&s;hed and went to dinner. This &s;tool and bench Tobias Matthew, then dean of Durham, cau&s;ed to be taken down, and made as plain as the re&s;t of the floor of the cloy&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD>The FRATER-HOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>In the &s;outh alley of the cloy&s;ters, is a large hall, called the Frater-hou&s;e, finely wain&s;cotted on the north and &s;outh &s;ides; and in the we&s;t and nether part thereof, is a long bench of &s;tone, in ma&s;on-work, from the cellar door to the pantry or cove door: Above the bench is wain&s;cot-work two yards and a half high, finely carved, &s;et with embo&s;&s;ed work in wain&s;cot, and gilded under the carved work. Above the wain&s;cot was a large picture of our Saviour Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and St John, in fine gilt work, and mo&s;t excellent colours; which pictures having been wa&s;hed over with lime, did long appear through it. This wain&s;cot had engraven on the top of it, Thomas Ca&s;tell, prior, anno Domini 1518, men&s;is Julij. Whence it is manife&s;t, that prior Ca&s;tell wain&s;cotted the Frater-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Within the Frater-hou&s;e door, on the left-hand at entering, is a &s;trong almery in the wall, wherein a great mazer, called the grace-cup, &s;tood, which every day &s;erved the monks after grace, to drink out of round the table; the cup was finely edged about with &s;ilver, and double gilt. In the &s;ame place were kept many large and great mazers of the &s;ame &s;ort; among which was one called Judas's cup, edged about with &s;ilver, and double gilt, having a ba&s;e to &s;tand upon of &s;ilver double gilt: This was never in u&s;e but on Maundy Thur&s;day, at night, when the prior and convent met to keep their Maundy. In the &s;ame almery was a goodly cup, cal|led St Bede's bowl; the out&s;ide was of black mazer, the in&s;ide of &s;ilver double gilt, and the edge finely wrought with &s;ilver, and double gilt; in the mid&s;t was the picture of the holy St Bede, &s;itting in a writing po&s;ture; the ba&s;e thereof of &s;ilver, double gilt, with four joints of &s;ilver coming down, all double gilt from the edge to the ba&s;e to be taken in pieces. In that almery lay all the be&s;t plate that &s;erved the whole convent in the Frater-hou&s;e on fe&s;tival days; and there was a fine work of carved wain&s;cot, and a &s;trong lock on the door, &s;o that none could perceive there was any almery at all, the key-hole being made under the carved work of the wain|&s;cot: And there is another large a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mery within the Frater-hou&s;e, on the right-hand on going to the cellar, of wain&s;cot, having &s;everal almeries within, fine wrought, and vari&s;hed over with red varni&s;h, in which lay &s;eve|ral table-cloths, &s;alts, mazers, a ba&s;on and ewer of latten, with other things pertaining to the Frater-hou&s;e, and the loft where the monks dined and &s;upped. Every monk had his mazer to him&s;elf to drink in, and all other things that &s;erved the whole convent, and the Frater-hou&s;e, in their daily &s;ervice, at their diet, and at their table. All the mazers were finely edged with double gilt &s;ilver, and another ba&s;on and ewer of latten. On this ewer was pourtrayed a man on hor&s;eback, as riding a-hunting, which &s;erved the &s;ub-prior to wa&s;h his hands in at the afore&s;aid table, he &s;itting there as chief.</P>
<P>In this Frater-hou&s;e the prior and whole convent of the monks held the great fea&s;t of St Cuthbert, in Lent, having their meat &s;erved out of the dre&s;&s;er-window of the great kitchen into the Frater-hou&s;e, and their drink out of the great cellar. From the ea&s;t end, being the highe&s;t of the Frater-hou&s;e, adjoining to the deanery, the roof of lead was taken down by dean Whittingham, and that part annexed to his own hou&s;e, making it a flat roof, whereby he gained twenty pounds.</P>
<P>At the ea&s;t end of the Frater-hou&s;e &s;tood a neat table, with a &s;creen of wain&s;cot over it, being kept for the ma&s;ter of the novices, the elects, and the novices, to dine and &s;up at, having their meat &s;erved to them in at the dre&s;&s;er widow from the great kitchen, and their drink out of the great cellar.</P>
<P>At the&s;e times the ma&s;ter ob&s;erved the&s;e whole&s;ome and godly orders, for the continual in&s;truction of their youth in virtue and learning; that is, one of the novices, appointed by the ma&s;ter, read &s;ome part of the Old and New Te&s;tament in Latin, during dinner, having a convenient place at the &s;outh end of the high table,
<PB N="65" REF="77">within a beautiful gla&s;s widow, encompa&s;&s;ed with iron, and certain &s;tone-&s;teps, with iron rails to go up to an iron de&s;k, whereon lay the holy Bible.

<P>Within the cloy&s;ter-garth, over again&s;t the Frater-hou&s;e door, was a &s;ine laver or conduit, for the monks to wa&s;h their hands and faces in, being in form round, covered with lead, and all of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, excepting the outer wall, within which they might walk about the laver.

<HEAD>The CUSTOM of BURYING PRIORS.</HEAD>
<P>The priors of the hou&s;e of Durham were accu&s;tomed in ancient time to be buried in their boots, and wound in their cowls by the barber, as the monks u&s;ed to be buried. The dead prior was carried out of his lodgings in the priory, to the chamber in the infirmary, called the Dead Man's Chamber, there to remain a certain time: At night he was carried into a chapel oppo&s;ite to that chamber door, called St Andrew's Chapel, and was watched all that night by the children of the almery, reading David's p&s;alms over him; and two monks either of kindred or kindne&s;s, were appointed to &s;it all night at his feet, mourning for him. In the morning he was carried into the chapter-hou&s;e, where the &s;ame &s;olemn &s;ervice was performed for him, which the monks had at their burial; thence he was carried through the parlour into the centry-garth to be buried, where every prior lay under a &s;ine marble &s;tone: And the monks and barber buried him with a little chalice of &s;ilver, other metal, or wax, which was laid upon his brea&s;t within the coffin, and his blue bed was held over him by four monks till he was buried, which the barber had for his pains, for making the grave and burying him, as he had for the monks.</P>
<P>Afterwards the priors were buried within the church, and not in the centry-garth, in the &s;ame order and habit, with the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, and all other furniture, as their predece&s;&s;ors were buried before them in the centry-garth &mdash; Ancient Cu&s;toms of the Church at Durham.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q></NOTE>. He was buried in the chapter-hou&s;e, between bi&s;hops Walcher and William.</P>
<P>After Turgot's departure for the See of St Andrew's, unhappy di&s;&s;entions took place between the mona&s;tery and bi&s;hop Flambard; no prior was appointed for a con&s;iderable time; and the duties of archdeacon, official, and vicar-general, were &s;evered from the office of prior: The bi&s;hop al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;everal of the conventual e&s;tates, as lands beyond the bridge which he built, called Framwel|gate or Durham bridge, Staindrop, Blaki&s;ton, lands in Wolvi&s;ton and Burdon, and the church of Sigge&s;ton.</P>
<P>Before we advance further in the hi&s;tory of this church, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the monks tran&s;lated thither were of the Benedictine order. They followed the rules of St Benedict, who was born at Nor&s;i, in the dukedom of Spoletto, in Italy, about the year 480, and died about 543. But his rule &s;eems not to have been confirmed till 52 years after his death, when pope Gregory the Great gave a &s;anction to it. The habit of the&s;e monks was a black loo&s;e coat, or a gown of &s;tuff reaching down to their heels, with a cowl or hood of the &s;ame, and a &s;capu|lary;
<PB N="67" REF="79">
and under that, a white habit, as large as the former, made of flannel, with boots on their legs; and from the colour of their outward habit, they were gene|rally called Black monks. This rule was introduced into England in king Edgar's time, but never perfectly ob&s;erved till after the Conque&s;t. Of this order were all our cathedral priories, except Carli&s;le and mo&s;t of the riche&s;t abbeys in England.</P>
<P>The Benedictines were obliged to perform their devotion &s;even times within four-and-twenty hours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Concord. Regular, collected by St Benedict, and publi&s;hed with a comment by Friar Aenard 1638.&mdash; Fuller's Ch. Hi&s;t. lib. vi. p. 287.&mdash;Collier's Ecc. Hi&s;t. lib. ii. p. 107.</NOTE>.

MATINS: The&s;e were &s;aid at the fir&s;t hour, or, according to our computation, at &s;ix o'clock: At this time the Jewi&s;h morning &s;acrifice was offered: The angels likewi&s;e were &s;up|po&s;ed to have acquainted the women with our Saviour's re&s;urrection about this hour. The TIERCE; which was at nine in the morning, when our Saviour was condem|ned and &s;courged by Pilate. The SEXTE, or twelve at noon. The NONE, or three in the afternoon: At this hour it is &s;aid our Saviour gave up the gho&s;t; be|&s;ides which circum&s;tance, it was a time for public prayer in the temple at Jeru|&s;alem. VESPERS, at &s;ix in the afternoon: The evening &s;acrifice was then offered in the Jewi&s;h temple; and our Saviour is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been taken down from the cro&s;s at this hour. The COMPLINE: This &s;ervice was performed after &s;even, when our Saviour's agony in the garden, it is believed, begun. The monks going to bed at eight, had &s;ix hours to &s;leep before the Nocturnal began: If they went to bed after that &s;ervice, it was not, as we under&s;tand, reckoned a fault; but after mattins they were not allowed that liberty. At the tolling of the bell for prayers, the monks were immediately to leave off their bu&s;ine&s;s; and herein the canon was &s;o &s;trict, that tho&s;e who copied books, or were clerks in any bu&s;ine&s;s, and had begun a text letter, were not allowed to fini&s;h it. Tho&s;e who were employed abroad about the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, were pre&s;umed to be pre&s;ent, and excu&s;ed other duties; and that they might not &s;uffer by being el&s;ewhere, they were parti|cularly recommended to the divine protection. The monks were obliged to go al|ways two together; this was done to guard their conduct, to prompt them to good thoughts, and furni&s;h them with a witne&s;s to defend their behaviour. From Ea&s;ter to Whit&s;untide the primitive church ob&s;erved no fa&s;ts; at other times the reli|gious were bound to fa&s;t till three o'clock on Wedne&s;days and Fridays; but the twelve days in Chri&s;tmas were excepted in this canon. Every day in Lent they were enjoined to fa&s;t till &s;ix in the evening: During this &s;olemnity, they &s;hortened their refre&s;hment, allowed fewer hours for &s;leep, and &s;pent more time in their de|votions; but they were not permitted to go into voluntary au&s;terities, without leave from the abbot. They were not to talk in the refectory at meals, but hearken to the &s;criptures read to them at that time. The Septimarians, &s;o called from their weekly offices of readers, waiters, cooks, &amp;c. were to dine by them&s;elves, after the re&s;t. Tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent about bu&s;ine&s;s, had the &s;ame hours of prayer pre|&s;cribed,
<PB N="68" REF="80">
though not the &s;ame length of devotions. Tho&s;e &s;ent abroad, and ex|pected to return at night, were forbidden to eat till they came home: But this canon was &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ed with. The Compline was to be &s;olemnly &s;ung about &s;even at night: The &s;ervice concluded with this ver&s;e, <HI>Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips.</HI> After this &s;ervice the monks were not al|lowed to talk, but went to bed immediately. They were all to &s;leep in the &s;ame dormitory, but not two in a bed: They lay in their cloaths. For &s;mall faults they were excluded the public table; but for greater, were debarred religious commerce, and the &s;ervice of the chapel: And tho&s;e conver&s;ing with a per&s;on under &s;uch cen&s;ure, were liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment. Incorrigible criminals were ex|pelled the mona&s;teries. When a brother was again received after expul&s;ion, he lo&s;t his &s;eniority, and was placed the la&s;t in the convent. Every monk was to have two coats and two cowls; and when they had new cloaths, their old ones were given to the poor: Each had a table-book, a knife, a needle, and a handkerchief: The furniture of the bed was a mat, blanket, rug, and pillow. The &s;uperior was never to dine alone; &s;o, when there were no &s;trangers, he was to invite &s;ome of his brethren to his table.&mdash;Such were the regulations of this mona&s;tery.</P>

<P>Hugh Pud&s;ey, after the example of his predece&s;&s;ors, was de&s;irous of contributing to the beauty and magnificence of the church at Durham, and projected a &s;umptu|ous addition towards the ea&s;t. The only author who mentions this, is Geoffrey de Coldingham <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Ang. Sac. p. 722, 723.</NOTE>, who tells us, that he began to erect a new work at the ea&s;t end of the church, for which he imported from abroad marble columns and ba&s;es; but having laid the foundations, and carried up the walls to &s;ome con&s;iderable height, employing the mo&s;t &s;kilful arti&s;ts therein, the building repeatedly failed and &s;hrunk, to the imminent peril of the workmen; which &s;ufficiently indicated to him, that the intended work was not acceptable to Heaven and St Cuthbert: So that he de|&s;i&s;ted therefrom, and built the Gallilee at the we&s;t end of the church, for the re|ception of women; where they might have the benefit of the holy offices, being otherwi&s;e debarred from the &s;olemnities. It doth not appear the marble columns were placed in the Gallilee. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in this place, that the ea&s;tern tran&s;ept of the church is rather a &s;ingularity, and was not built near the time of the other parts; the architecture throughout the whole being different. Great im|provements in architecture were made, from the aera of the foundation by bi&s;hop William, to the time of bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey's death: The more elegant Gothic order

took place of the Saxon, and the pointed arches came in u&s;e: All the windows of this part of the edifice, in the lower arrangement to the ea&s;t, are pointed: The clu&s;tered pila&s;ters are chiefly of marble, though &s;hamefully defaced and bedaubed with a wa&s;h of lime and ochre: There are no marble pila&s;ters in any other part of the church, or any of the like order of ma&s;onry. Although no hi&s;torian tells us who fini&s;hed this work, yet that it was begun by bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey is certain, and left by him unfini&s;hed for rea&s;ons hid in &s;uper&s;titious allegory; probably it was com|pleated in the time of bi&s;hop Farnham and prior Thomas Mel&s;onby. The Gallilee, &s;aid to be built by bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, doth not appear to be wholly a new erection; it is probable he improved it, and appropriated the place to the pious purpo&s;e before a&s;cribed to it: It is formed with a triple range of pillars, &s;o as to divide it into five ailes, nearly of equal width; the arches are circular, and ornamented with zigzag mouldings; the pillars are light, and clu&s;tered; above the arches is a dead facing or wall, which goes up to the roof, without any apparent utility, and far from be|ing ornamental; the windows are pointed.

<P>was elected prior in 1233; and on the decea&s;e of bi&s;hop Richard, in the year 1237, was nominated to &s;ucceed him, and with much reluctance &s;ubmitted to the choice. He was objected to by the king, who alledged many things again&s;t him of a politi|cal nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 204.</NOTE>, and others per&s;onal: <Q>That he was an infringer of the liberties of the church, was di&s;ea&s;ed in body, had broken his vow, and di&s;regarded religious in|junctions, particularly the ordained fa&s;ts; that he was guilty of &s;imony, was il|literate,</Q> and &s;uch like charges, equally &s;landerous and untrue. After &s;uch an oppo&s;ition, unwilling the See &s;hould longer continue vacant, he renounced his elec|tion, and bi&s;hop Farnham &s;ucceeded. Fearful of the king's re&s;entment, he re&s;igned his office in the year 1244, and retired to Farne i&s;land, where in acts of piety and charity he &s;pent the remainder of his life. His body was brought to Durham to be interred. In the year 1242 the prior, with the approbation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bi&s;hop, began to remove the whole of the old roof from the cathedral church, and gave this noble edifice the additional elegance of a vault of &s;tone-work.

</TEXT></Q></NOTE>. Again&s;t this contract our prior appealed, alledging, that he and his con|vent were at all times ready to obey the pope in things lawful and practicable; but to &s;poil their churches of their goods, to &s;ubvert their liberties, and &s;traiten their maintenance, would be &s;uch an indignity to the church, &s;candal to the clergy, and reproach to religion it&s;elf, that they never could a&s;&s;ent thereto. It cannot be doubt|ed but this reply would prove offen&s;ive, as well to the See of Rome as the crown of England; and in 1258 we &s;ee the prior re&s;igning his dignity, though the hi&s;torians of that time do not immediately expre&s;s it to be in con&s;equence of &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ure. On the 17th of the calends of Augu&s;t the prior petitioned the convent to admit of his re&s;ignation, and that they would provide a maintenance for his retirement, al|ledging at once his want of con&s;titutional abilities to execute the duties of his high office, and al&s;o the &s;ervices he had undergone in forty years mona&s;tic life, fourteen of which he had been prior; he a&s;&s;erted, he had obtained a bull for his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, but would not u&s;e its authority. Me&s;&s;engers were accordingly &s;ent to the bi&s;hop with his requi&s;ition, who in return commanded his commi&s;&s;ioners to hear the al|legations, and they by virtue of their authority admitted the &s;ame, and committed the care of the &s;piritualties of the mona&s;tery to the &s;ub-prior, and the temporalties to R. de Waltham, con&s;table of the ca&s;tle. The convent a&s;&s;igned to Bertram for his maintenance, the churches of Pittington, Heighington, &amp;c. Notwith&s;tanding the great work he had carried on in the church for two years, he left to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the conventual trea&s;ury 11,000 marks. He was not only a zealous churchman, giving up his life to acts of piety, but al&s;o a punctual maintainer of the rights of the mona&s;tery. He left to the mona&s;tic library many of his compo&s;itions and learned works. His name was held in pious veneration by the cloi&s;ter. His frugality was manife&s;ted in his management of the revenue allotted him, for therewith he not only &s;upplied the nece&s;&s;ities of life, but was enabled to build at Beaurepaire a lodge or &s;ummer retreat, with a chapel, not inferior in elegance to other erections of the like nature in the dioce&s;e.</P>

He contributed greatly to the magnificence of his convent. He built the belfry on the &s;ummit of the great tower of the cathedral church, and enlarged the organ: He al&s;o emparked Muggle&s;wick and Beaurepaire. At Wardelau, as one author writes, he erected a lodge or camera, a hall and chapel, which were afterwards de&s;troyed by the Scots in their incur&s;ion: He built a lodge or camera at Muggle&s;wick; the remains of which, and al&s;o that at Beaurepaire, will be de&s;cribed in the progre&s;s of this work <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 741.</NOTE>. In this prior's time, a bull was obtained from the pope for the appropriation of Hoveden church for an addition of &s;ixteen monks; but, at a con&s;iderable expence, he procured the appointment to be converted into prebends, apprehending they would prove as honourable and advan|tageous promotions, and as acceptable to the clergy whom he wi&s;hed to &s;erve, as if the original in&s;titution was maintained. This prior was di&s;tingui&s;hed for his ho&s;pi|tality and charitable actions: Whenever he came to his hou&s;e, the poor people, to whom his kitchen was ever open, danced before him: P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im the &s;criptures were fulfilled, in cloathing the naked and feeding the hungry. It is &s;aid of him, that the common coinage of a denarius or penny was reduced to five mites, that he might di&s;tribute handfuls of that &s;mall money to a greater number of objects. When advanced in years, and obliged to travel in a chariot, he con&s;tantly threw money from thence to the poor. He was a per&s;on of approved wi&s;dom, as well as of a magnificent mind. Frequent applications were made to the bi&s;hop to re|ceive his re&s;ignation, pleading his infirmities and age, which in the event produced an altercation between the convent and prelate concerning profe&s;&s;ion of obedience by the monks <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><P>MSS.

to make their profe&s;&s;ion and receive his benediction; but the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;till de|layed, on account of &s;ome formalities which remained un&s;ettled, until the 10th of January, when the bi&s;hop in the chapter-hou&s;e accepted the prior's re&s;ignation, and the manors of Wardelau (according to our author's words) and Muggle&s;wick were a&s;&s;igned for his maintenance; the bi&s;hop added Ryton thereto. The&s;e affairs being &s;ettled, a conver&s;ation took place between one of the monks and the bi&s;hop, in which the bi&s;hop complained with warmth that "he had &s;uffered greater indignity and di&s;re&s;pect than any of his predece&s;&s;ors;" but declared, "he would &s;eek &s;atis|faction in God's good time." He had &s;carce departed the gates before his &s;ene&s;cal, with the con&s;table of the ca&s;tle and their officers, entered the convent, pronouncing, that they came at the prelate's command, in his place, to have cu&s;tody of the hou&s;e during the vacancy of the office of prior. The next day the &s;ene&s;cal, calling the &s;ub-prior and other officers of the hou&s;hold into the hall, commanded the porters, the mar&s;hal, and other &s;ecular &s;ervants of the mona&s;tery, to come forth, &s;aying, the hou&s;e was in the cu&s;tody of the lord bi&s;hop, therefore he de&s;ired to &s;ee who were proper to take care of it, that he might take their oaths of fidelity, remove tho&s;e he did not approve, and &s;ub&s;titute others in their places.

Two of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ethren were &s;ent without delay to the bi&s;hop, with a peti|tion for licence to elect a prior; on peru&s;ing which, he rejected it, not being ad|dre&s;&s;ed to him as &s;upreme lord and patron; alledging, if he was not patron, they were under no nece&s;&s;ity to &s;eek a licence.

On the return of the me&s;&s;engers, many of the convent recollected that the cau&s;e of &s;uch precedented rejection was not as alledged by the bi&s;hop; for in the in&s;trument referred to, the bi&s;hop was addre&s;&s;ed as father and patron in &s;piritu|alties and temporalties, but the &s;eal of the convent by accident had been &s;eparated from the in&s;trument before it came to the prelate's hands, which occa&s;ioned it to be renewed before he granted his licence.

<HEAD>RICHARD CLAXTON,</HEAD>
<P>prior of the cell of Holy I&s;land, was elected prior of Durham on the 26th of Jan. 1273, and in the 12th of the pontificate of bi&s;hop Stichill; on the &s;econd day fol|lowing he was confirmed at Darlington, was in&s;talled by the archdeacon of Dur|ham on the day of the purification of the Virgin Mary, and three days afterwards confirmed the provi&s;ion made for his predece&s;&s;or on his re&s;ignation. Before the above in&s;tance, we are not told by any hi&s;torian of the priors having the &s;olemni|ties of confirmation and in&s;tallation, though it is probable it was an ancient u&s;age here. The prior abdicated his office on the 27th of December, 1285: No rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned by our author for this act, who tells us, that the prior was not only a man of great piety and ho&s;pitality, but of &s;trict circum&s;pection and attention touching the rights of the mona&s;tery; and notwith&s;tanding the great provi&s;ion made for prior Hugh, and the expen&s;ive litigations pro&s;ecuted between the arch|bi&s;hop of York and his church, the convent abounded in wealth during his whole admini&s;tration. He had a&s;&s;igned him for maintenance the cell of Weremouth, with the tithes of Southwick. In May, 1274, pope Gregory IV. held a council at Lyons, to which the prior was called, but did not attend, having only his proctors there: Bi&s;hop Stichill dying in that year, the archbi&s;hop during the va|cancy of the See appointed a vi&s;itation to be held in the chapter-hou&s;e at Durham the day before the vigil of All-Saints, which was &s;ubmitted to at that time; after which ceremony the archbi&s;hop repaired to the ca&s;tle, where he was entertained, Henry de Hornca&s;tre, then &s;acri&s;t of the cathedral church of Durham, bearing the

That author tells us, the prior came to an agreement with the archbi&s;hop of York, a&s;&s;enting to his exerci&s;e of juri&s;diction over the churches of the dioce&s;e during a vacancy of the See of Durham, as appears by an in&s;trument in writing, dated in the year 1286, on which all preceding cen&s;ures and judicial &s;en|tences touching that matter were re&s;cinded.

<HEAD>RICHARD DE HOTOUN</HEAD>

This prior was of a bold and virtuous mind, and having to do with the overbearing and proud prelate Bek, was obliged to exert him&s;elf for the pre&s;ervation of the privileges of his church: A di&s;pute &s;oon aro&s;e between them, which was fermented to a violent height, as has already been related in the annals of that prelate<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>; the excommunication, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and inter|diction of the prior being at length the con&s;equence of their conte&s;t.

Gray&s;tanes tells us, that a &s;avage

Luceby, whil&s;t he u&s;urped the office, retained many of the principal men of the palatinate in his family, and lived in a &s;plendid manner, that thereby he might win the approbation and e&s;teem of the people; but &s;uch mea&s;ures did not prevail, for many treated him with high contempt.

<P>In the year 1303, on the day of St Peter <HI>ad Vincula,</HI> prior Hotoun returned to Durham, and was received mo&s;t cordially by the convent, who held a fe&s;tival on the occa&s;ion: An inqui&s;ition was afterwards taken by men of the county of Nor|thumberland touching the damages &s;u&s;tained by the convent under the bi&s;hop's per&s;ecution, by the &s;eizure of their revenues and de&s;truction of their parks, in which the bi&s;hop employed the mo&s;t able advocates the kingdom afforded, whil&s;t the prior's cau&s;e was managed by one only, who&s;e name was William de Herle, and whom Gray&s;tanes perpetuates; when the bi&s;hop was ju&s;tly condemned in a large &s;um of money. The pope dying &s;oon after, the bi&s;hop obtained from his &s;ucce&s;&s;or a bull, requiring the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the bi&s;hops of Lincoln and Winche&s;ter to vi&s;it the chapter of Durham, on an accu&s;ation lodged again&s;t the prior for dilapidations and divers offences, touching which the prelates were com|manded

The prior, on his journey to Rome for redre&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the winter near Canterbury, &s;ending from thence two monks of his convent, as proctors: Whil&s;t he remained there, the bi&s;hop committed the care of the mona&s;tery to Luceby; and the abbot of Leice&s;ter with the pope's mandatory letters accompanied him to Dur|ham, to give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but on their arrival, they &s;ound the gates &s;hut again&s;t them, and their admittance refu&s;ed; on which, they pronounced an excommuni|cation again&s;t the whole &s;ociety: This brought on a litigation, at the in&s;tance of the prior, for an offence again&s;t the crown, on their pre&s;uming to execute the powers of the See of Rome in matters temporal, and a grievous &s;ine was impo&s;ed upon the offenders.</P>
<P>The prior returned from the South to meet the king at Durham, and on the fe&s;|tival of St O&s;wald the martyr, celebrated ma&s;s in the royal pre&s;ence at the altar of St O&s;wald. The king granted him licence to vi&s;it Rome, and recommendatory letters to the pope for redre&s;s, with which he pa&s;&s;ed into Italy, but did not live to return: He met with a favourable reception from the pope and college, and on the 24th of October obtained a &s;entence of re&s;titution, but was decreed to pay one thou&s;and marks to the apo&s;tolical chamber for the &s;ame. On the 9th of Jan. (Gray&s;tanes &s;ays in the year 1307, but from other authorities in 1308) the prior de|parted this life; and that the See of Rome might be indemnified for the lo&s;s of the fine, all his goods, plate, books, hor&s;es, and effects then in Italy, were confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>Prior Hotoun was not deficient in public works, notwith&s;tanding the troubles in which he was embarra&s;&s;ed: He compleated the manor-hou&s;e of Houghhall; with the bi&s;hop's licence he purcha&s;ed Oxford Place, afterwards called Durham College, and made the fir&s;t erections there <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The account we have of this foundation is, That the monks of Durham might have a receptacle &s;et their novices in the univer&s;ity, as Glouce&s;ter had lately obtained before for theirs in Stockwell-&s;treet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> begin to lay their fir&s;t foundation in Canditch.

called Beaurepaire or Bearpark. The convent received a grant of free|warren in their territories at Win&s;ton about this time.</P>
<P>During this prior's office, the di&s;pute which aro&s;e between Ralph lord Nevill, of Raby, and the convent, in the time of prior Claxton, was continued, and did not &s;ub&s;ide for &s;everal years. The account we have of it is to the following effect, as given by Dugdale in his Baronage, vol. i. p. 292.</P>
<P>"About the 13 Edw. I. 1285, there was much variance between the inhabitants of the bi&s;hopric of Durham and Anthony Beke (that great prelate) then bi&s;hop of Durham, by rea&s;on he had compelled them to go twice into Scotland with hor&s;e and arms, which they alledged to be contrary to right, in regard they held their lands to defend the body of St Cuthbert; and that they ought not, either for king or bi&s;hop, to go beyond the rivers of Tyne and Tees. Ralph Nevill, then lord of Ra|by, was the chief countenancer of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the bi&s;hop. Not long after, another di&s;pute aro&s;e between this Ralph and Hugh de Derlyngton then prior of Durham, about the offering of a &s;tag every year upon St Cuthbert's day in Septem|ber; which (in truth) was rather a rent than an oblation, in regard he held Raby with the eight adjoining town&s;hips, by the yearly rent of four pounds and a &s;tag. For contrary to the cu&s;tom of his ance&s;tors, he not only required, that the prior of Durham, at the offering of the &s;tag, ought to fea&s;t him and all the company he &s;hould bring, but that the prior's own menial &s;ervants &s;hould for that time be &s;et a&s;ide, and his peculiar &s;ervants and officers put in their &s;tead. Whereupon among&s;t other of his gue&s;ts he invited John de Baliol of Barnard Ca&s;tle, who refu&s;ed to go with him, alledging, that he never knew the Nevills to have &s;uch a privilege there; Sir Wm de Brompton, the bi&s;hop's chief-ju&s;tice, likewi&s;e acknowledging, that he him&s;elf was the fir&s;t who began that extravagant practice; for being a young man, and delight|ing in hunting, he came with the lord Nevill at the offering of the &s;tag, and &s;aid to his companions, "Come let us go into the abbey and wind our horns," and &s;o they did. The prior farther adding, that before the time of this Ralph, none of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors ever made any &s;uch claim, but when they brought the &s;tag into the hall they had only a breakfa&s;t; nor did the lord him&s;elf ever &s;tay dinner, except he was invited.</P>
<P>In the 5 Edw. III. 1331, Ralph Nevill (&s;on of the former) doing his fealty to William de Couton then prior of Durham, upon Lammas-day, for the manor of Raby, he told him he would offer the &s;tag as his ance&s;tors had done; &s;aving that, whereas his father required, that the prior's &s;ervants &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide at that time, and his own &s;erve in their &s;tead; he would be content, that his &s;hould attend to|gether with tho&s;e of the prior: And whereas his father in&s;i&s;ted, that his &s;ervants &s;hould only be admitted at dinner; he &s;tood upon it, that his &s;hould be there en|tertained the whole day, and likewi&s;e the morrow at breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Whereunto the prior made an&s;wer, that none of his ance&s;tors were ever &s;o ad|mitted, and that he would rather quit the &s;tag, than &s;uffer any new cu&s;tom to the prejudice of the church. But to this Ralph replied, that he would perform the whole &s;ervice or none, and put the trial of his right upon the country. The prior, therefore, knowing him to be &s;o powerful, and that the country dur&s;t not di&s;plea&s;e him, declined the offer. However, at length to gain his favour, (in regard he had no &s;mall intere&s;t at court, and might do him a kindne&s;s or a di&s;|plea&s;ure)
<PB N="85" REF="97">
was content for that one time he &s;hould perform it as he plea&s;ed, &s;o that it might not be drawn into example afterwards; and for that purpo&s;e propo&s;ed, that indentures &s;hould be made between them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord, Nevill brought but few with him, and tho&s;e more for the honour of the prior than a burthen, and &s;o &s;hortly after dinner took his leave, but left one of his &s;ervants to lodge there all night, and to take his breakfa&s;t there on the next day; prote&s;ting, that being both a &s;on and tenant to the church, he would not be burthen&s;ome to it, in re&s;pect it would be no advantage to him&s;elf, but might much damnify it, if he &s;hould bring with him as great a train as he would, &s;aying, <HI>What doth a breakfa&s;t &s;ignify to me? Nothing.</HI> And likewi&s;e, that if the prior would &s;hew, that he had no right to what he &s;o claimed, he would free|ly recede therefrom; and if he had a right, he would accept of a compo&s;ition for it, rather than be burthen&s;ome to the convent; but if they &s;hould put him to get his right by law, then he would not abate any thing thereof.</P>
<P>Whereupon enquiry being made among&s;t the olde&s;t monks of the hou&s;e, they affirmed, that being of eight years &s;tanding when his father was before repul&s;ed, they had often &s;een the &s;tag offered, and that he never &s;taid dinner but when the prior invited him; and &s;ome ancient men of the country te&s;tified as much; as al|&s;o, that as &s;oon as the &s;tag was brought, they carried him to the kitchen, and tho&s;e who brought him were taken into the hall to breakfa&s;t, as they that brought their rents u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>Moreover, when it happened that any of the lords Nevill were de&s;ired to &s;tay dinner with the prior, his cook was admitted into the kitchen to prepare a di&s;h for him; &s;o likewi&s;e another &s;ervant in the cellar to chu&s;e his drink, and in like manner &s;ome other at the gate, who knew his &s;ervants and followers, merely to let them in, and keep others out, who, under pretence of being his &s;ervants, might then intrude; but this was only done by the prior out of courte&s;y and re&s;pect, and not at all of right.</P>
<P>Hereupon Henry le Scrope, one of the ju&s;tices, affirmed, that he had been of coun&s;el with Ralph Nevill (father of this Ralph) when he brought his writ of <HI>Novell Di&s;&s;ei&s;in</HI> again&s;t the prior; and told him that he had no right at all: Where|upon Ralph let fall his &s;uit.</P>
<P>Some &s;aid, that making this claim out of his own &s;ee, he ought there, (viz. in the priory) to &s;hew &s;ome &s;pecial evidence to a&s;&s;ert his claim. Others, that as the prior did challenge nothing of him, but what was re&s;erved by the grant; &s;o could not he, unle&s;s he &s;hewed a charter for it. And be&s;ides, claiming to be entertained with as many as he &s;hould bring, and not &s;pecifying the number, there could be no lawful rea&s;on for it; becau&s;e the &s;tag was always offered on Holy Rood day, whereupon grew an old &s;ong in rhyme, as a lamentation for Robert de Nevill, his great grandfather.</P>
<Q><L>Wel I wa, &s;al ys Hornes blaw</L>
<L>Holy Rode this Day;</L>
<L>Nou es he dede, and lies law</L>
<L>Was wont to blaw tham ay.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="86" REF="98">Moreover, it was further &s;aid, that it never had been the cu&s;tom of the prior to make a fea&s;t on that day, when the &s;ervants of &s;o great a per&s;on was to offer; and that the prior u&s;ually on St Cuthbert's day had wont to dine with the bi&s;hop at &s;ome of his own manor-hou&s;es; therefore, who &s;hould compel him to make a fea&s;t at home? Likewi&s;e, that tho&s;e lands were given to the ance&s;tors of this lord Nevill, when they were not &s;uch great men as to have a mar&s;hal, a butler, and other &s;ervants of &s;tate; for in tho&s;e days, they had no more than Raby with its appurte|nances, which was not then of &s;o much worth as it is now; for Brancepeth and Ra&s;|kelfe came to them &s;ince by marriage; as al&s;o other lands in York&s;hire and Rich|mond&s;hire: Therefore it could not be thought that the prior of Durham did give lands of &s;uch value, and purcha&s;e the &s;ervice to be done for them at &s;o high a rate, e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that in the prior's land book, not only all the &s;ervices are exactly regi&s;tered, but what&s;oever others ought to receive of him. And la&s;tly, that there is not &s;o much as mention made of this &s;ervice in any of their chroni|cles."</P>
<P>During the vacancy of the priory, the bi&s;hop &s;eized the temporalties of the con|vent, and by Stephen Mauley (de Malo-lacu) his vicar-general, di&s;placed the &s;ub|prior, the priors of the cells, and many who were adherents of the decea&s;ed prior, appointing others in their places: The prior of Coldingham alone was continued in his office. This Gray&s;tanes exclaims again&s;t as a flagrant breach of the privileges of the convent, though the bi&s;hop alledged the members of the hou&s;e were not ca|pable of holding offices, by rea&s;on of the &s;entence of excommunication, which re|mained unpurged. In this period much perplexity aro&s;e touching pre&s;entations to vacant churches, till it was determined they &s;hould be made jointly, under the title of <HI>Anthony bi&s;hop of Durham and the convent of Durham, the office of prior being va|cant.</HI> In the year 1308, on the morrow of the Purification, the bi&s;hop vi&s;ited the chapter in the order pre&s;cribed by pope Boniface, when, for no other irregularity or offence than their attachment to the prior in his &s;truggles again&s;t the prelate's oppre&s;&s;ions, he &s;u&s;pended the following members of the &s;ociety for ten years:&mdash; Richard de A&s;lakby, who was &s;ub-prior in prior Hotoun's time; Galfridus de Bur|don, prior of Finchale; and Nicholas de Rothbury, almoner of Durham.

only much impoveri&s;hed by the expences incurred, and heavy debt contracted on account of their litigations with him; but al&s;o greatly embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the defection of the prior of Coldingham, who renounced his obedience and &s;ubjection to the mona&s;tery: The prior of Durham vi&s;ited that convent, and di&s;|placed the prior for his offence, appointing another in his room: After having re|ceived the homage and fealty of the terr-tenants of the &s;hrine, he followed the de|po&s;ed prior to Stamford, whither he ha&s;tened to lay his complaint before the par|liament, hoping the king and his mini&s;ters would &s;upport him again&s;t his &s;uperior, as he was per&s;onally known to them, having carried the banner of St Cuthbert in the Scotch war; but in this was di&s;appointed, for the countenance of the court was denied to &s;uch injurious proceedings.</P>
<P>The prior of Durham obtained permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it Rome, where he &s;taid till the prelate's death. On the acce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hop Kellow, the convent experienced a happy change of circum&s;tances, and received repeated marks of that prelate's coun|tenance and favour; he rever&s;ed all the oppre&s;&s;ive acts of his predece&s;&s;or, and re|&s;tored the ancient privileges of the mona&s;tery, e&s;pecially in the material point, that during the vacancy of the priory, none &s;ave the &s;ub-prior and chapter &s;hould intermeddle with the &s;piritualties or temporalties of the convent; the bi&s;hop re|taining to the See the right of having one clerk in the hou&s;e as a nominal guardian thereof, with three hor&s;es and three &s;ervants, without claiming to have any further concern with the goods of the hou&s;e.

<P>And where al&s;o, as the late kinge, for the better maintenance and pre&s;ervation of the &s;aid churches, in a godly unity and good order and governance, graunted unto the &s;everal corporations and bodyes corporate of every of the &s;aid churches that they &s;hould be ruled and governed for ever, according unto certaine ordinan|ces, rules and &s;tatutes, to be &s;pecifyed in certaine indentures then after to be made by his highnes, and to be delivered and declared to every of the bodyes corporate of the &s;aid &s;everal churches, as by the &s;everal erections and foundations of the &s;aid churches more plainly it doth and may appear: Since which &s;aid erec|tions and foundations, the &s;aid late kinge did cau&s;e to be delivered to every of the &s;aid churches, &s;o as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;aid erected and incorporated, by certaine commi&s;&s;ioners by his highnes appointed, diver&s;e and &s;undrye &s;tatutes and ordinances, made and declared by the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ioners, for the order, rule and governance of the &s;aid &s;everal churches, and of the deanes, prebendaries and mini&s;ters of the &s;ame; which &s;aid &s;tatutes and ordinances were made by the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners, and delivered unto every of the corporations of the &s;aid &s;e|veral churches in writinge, but not indented, according to the forme of the &s;aid foundations and erections, by rea&s;on whereof, the &s;aid churches, and the &s;everal deanes, prebendaries and mini&s;ters of the &s;ame, have no &s;tatutes or ordinances of any force or authority, whereby they &s;hould be ruled and governed, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as yet not fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, in &s;uch &s;ort as the godly intent of the &s;aid late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Henry the Eighth was, to the greate imperfection of the &s;ame churches, and the hinderance of God's &s;ervice, and good order and regiment to be had and continued among&s;t the mini&s;ters of the &s;ame.</P>

<P>The dean is to be in&s;talled and placed in his &s;eat in the chapter-hou&s;e by the &s;ub|dean or &s;enior re&s;identiary, where, having taken the pre&s;cribed oath, both major and minor canons &s;hall promi&s;e canonical obedience to him in the&s;e words: <HI>Domine decane, promitto tibi canonicam obedientiam tanquam decano.</HI> The dean's power and juri&s;diction is &s;upreme, touching the government of the church. He &s;hall hear all cau&s;es relative to the chapter, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with their opinions, determine therein; correct exce&s;&s;es, and reprehend all ob&s;tinate offenders. He &s;hall inve&s;t the preben|daries in the pre&s;ence of their brethren, and in his and the chapter's name receive the oath pre&s;cribed. Being &s;uperior in authority, all &s;hall &s;tand when he enters or departs the choir or chapter-hou&s;e. He is fir&s;t in place and voice.

If the bi&s;hop is not pre&s;ent, it is the dean's office, or, in his ab&s;ence, the next in dignity, to pronounce the confe&s;&s;ion. All the mini&s;ters of the church &s;hall bow to him in his &s;tall as they enter or depart the choir.

Prebendaries' &s;ervants ought to be corrected by their proper ma&s;ters, unle&s;s their offences are heinous, and their ma&s;ters neglect that duty. Leave of ab&s;ence &s;hall be given by the dean to the minor canons and other officers of the church for one day, or at mo&s;t not exceeding eight days; and in his ab&s;ence, by the &s;ub-dean or &s;enior re&s;ident: Ab&s;ence for any greater time &s;hall not be given without con&s;ent of the chapter.</P>

<P>The an&s;wer of the dean and prebendaries to Bi&s;hop Co&s;in's articles of inquiry in his &s;econd vi&s;itation, A. D. 1665.</P>
<P>For the hou&s;es of the petty canons we certified your lord&s;hip in your fir&s;t vi&s;itation, that they were all in the&s;e late bad times de&s;troyed. That they were formerly but little hou&s;es or chambers, made only for un|married per&s;ons, and who had their diet in common. That we had already made their places better than when they had their old hou&s;es and &s;tipends: to which notwith&s;tanding, we have of our own accord, and upon public co&s;t, added &s;o much, that we hope in a little time, to &s;ee three good hou&s;es built for them this year, and have &s;ound out a good way for &s;upply of a fourth; and as &s;oon as Mr Dury can be removed, of a fifth al&s;o, though with &s;ome charges to repair this. The petty canons'-hall and the gue&s;t-hall, &s;ince the method of ho&s;pitality and diet were changed, were of long time u&s;ele&s;s and ruined in the&s;e la&s;t de&s;tructive times: But yet our de&s;ign is, by &s;ome reparation of walls, to render the place of the petty canons'-hall more &s;eemly. We found no &s;chool-hou&s;e &s;tanding, but have built a large one, with addition of divers rooms. In this article it appears, that the &s;econd, &s;ixth, eighth, and ninth prebend hou&s;es were a little before rebuilt in whole, or great part.</P>
<P>One of Bi&s;hop Co&s;in's injunctions at the clo&s;e of his vi&s;itation, 1668, was, that no one &s;hould carry any thing through the church; but that victuals, or any thing of that &s;ort &s;hould be &s;eized, and carried to the gaol, to be di&s;tributed among the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>It appears both by the vi&s;itation papers of Bi&s;hop Co&s;in and Bi&s;hop Crewe, that <HI>&s;ackbuts</HI> and <HI>cornets</HI> were then u&s;ed in the church mu&s;ic.</P></NOTE>. It belongs al&s;o to the trea&s;urer to attend to the re|pairs of the hou&s;es belonging to the chapter within the city of Durham; which re|pairs &s;hall be made between the 1&s;t day of March and Michaelmas, according to the dean or &s;ub-dean's orders; and not later in the year, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of great nece&s;|&s;ity, and where, in the dean's judgment, delay would be materially detrimental. Bills for repairs and other affairs of the church &s;hall not be allowed, unle&s;s the dean, or, he being ab&s;ent and not objecting, the &s;ub-dean &s;hall certify the &s;ame. The trea&s;urer &s;hall have charge of the plate, ve&s;tments, and muniments, lea&s;t the &s;acri&s;t &s;hould be negligent; and &s;hall examine them every quarter with the re|gi&s;ter, &amp;c. that nothing be wanting.

<P>Con&s;idering that this our church, during the late &s;chi&s;m, has been &s;poiled of all its ornaments and much wa&s;ted; and moreover, that a very &s;mall &s;tipend is a&s;&s;igned by the &s;tatutes to the mini&s;ters of this church, to alleviate which, we the dean and chapter, by common and unanimous con&s;ent, this 20th day of July, in the year of our Saviour 1556, in a general chapter held at Durham, have ordained and de|creed, that whoever after this day &s;hall be admitted into the place of canon or pre|bendary of this church, however becoming vacant before he be in&s;talled, is to pay the precentor three &s;hillings and four-pence; the regi&s;ter &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence; the two vergers four &s;hillings; for bread and wine five &s;hillings; to the bell-ringers one &s;hilling; the chapter of the re&s;ident prebendaries one pound; to the fabric and ornaments of the church one pound: And this we will to be ob|&s;erved as a local &s;tatute of the church for ever.</P>

The original &s;igned P. Smith, regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>It has been the cu&s;tom &s;ince the erection, to call the lands a&s;&s;igned to the dean and prebendaries for augmentation of re&s;idence and ho&s;pitality their corps; al|though in our local &s;tatutes the yearly &s;tipend of the dean is &s;aid to be given him <HI>pro corpore decanatus &s;ui,</HI> and of the prebendaries <HI>pro corpore prebendae &s;uae;</HI> the word <HI>corps</HI> being u&s;ed herein not otherwi&s;e, nor <HI>bycorps</HI> at all.</P>
<P>Our &s;tatutes were made by Queen Mary, in the fir&s;t year of her reign, &s;he being enabled thereto by an act of parliament. The former &s;tatutes by King Henry VIII. being defective, as in other things, &s;o in point of law, as appears by the preamble of that act. We have, I &s;uppo&s;e, no copy of the old &s;tatutes, but by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in our books, we may think they did not differ much from the new, in the matter of corps, and &s;ome other particulars: Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall having, as it is probable, a great hand in both; and there is a traditional commendation of him for the good &s;ervice he did the church concerning the &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>But &s;earching into the practice, we find the&s;e corps not &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of for a good while as they are now. At the erection of the deanry, although their corps with other lands, were &s;ettled upon the dean and prebendaries, they came not all of them into their hands at the &s;ame time, the prior and convent had lea&s;ed out &s;ome, as Houghhall and Witton-Gilbert, for forty years, and South Pittington for thirty-five years, &s;ome two years before the di&s;&s;olution; for if it had been but one year before, the lea&s;es had been void by an act of parliament. And King Henry VIII. in the interval between the di&s;&s;olution and erection, had made a grant of more of them to &s;everal per&s;ons for twenty-one years, &amp;c.</P>

W.) of which the 119th was one; together with the ten commandments, and a prayer, now placed at the end of the ver&s;ion. Soon after his return to England, he was employed to accompany Francis, earl of Bedford, on his emba&s;&s;y of condolence for the death of the French king, in 1560: And he attended Ambro&s;e, earl of War|wick, to Newhaven, to be preacher there, whil&s;t the earl defended it again&s;t the French; on which occa&s;ion he &s;hewed a reproachable di&s;po&s;ition, in &s;piriting the people again&s;t uniformity: The earl, either to be rid of him, or through an e&s;teem, which even his improprieties could not wean, obtained this deanry of the queen, on Skynner's death, although the &s;ame had been promi&s;ed by her maje&s;ty to Dr Wil&s;on, then one of her &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. Whittingham enjoyed the deanry &s;ixteen years; was a violent oppo&s;er of mea&s;ures touching the &s;acerdotal ve&s;ture, and u&s;ed all his influence with the earl of Leice&s;ter therein; &s;upporting Bi&s;hop Pilkingtru's

<P>Dean Whittingham was guilty of much profanation on the pious monuments and &s;acred remains in this church. The account given by Wood <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ath. Oxon. v. i. p. 154.</NOTE>, of tho&s;e acts of violence and irreligion, is &s;hortly &s;tated to the reader; but antecedent thereto, we beg leave to ob&s;erve, that in all ages, and with all people, where civilization and the true &s;pirit of religion prevailed, things applied to pious offices and religious ceremonies were held in &s;uch veneration, that defiling and employing them in mean and contemptuous u&s;es, was forbidden and puni&s;hed. The example of Balthazar, in holy writ, is tremendous; though the &s;uper&s;titious rites of the Jewi&s;h temple might render the ve&s;&s;els he abu&s;ed, as odious to tho&s;e who &s;tripped them from the &s;acred places, as ever dean Whittingham held the ve&s;&s;els of the church at Durham. Di&s;turbing the a&s;hes of the dead, is an offence to human nature, &s;uch as the mo&s;t ignorant of &s;avages refrain from; poli&s;hed nations of antiquity held &s;uch remains in the highe&s;t veneration, and did not conceive the mo&s;t depraved mind capable of their profanation: The Egyptian who left his father's corps unredeem|ed, was denied the privileges of &s;ociety. In profane hi&s;tory, the &s;tory of Camby&s;es affords us reflections of the like nature. The learned Dr Prideaux is a &s;ufficient authority to quote this in&s;tance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prideaux's Connection, &amp;c. v. i. p. 244.</NOTE>; and his words are, <Q>As he mounted his hor&s;e for the march, his &s;word falling out of the &s;cabbard, gave him a wound on the thigh, of which he died a few days after. The Egyptians remarking, that it was in the &s;ame part of the body, where he had afore wounded the Apis, reckoned it as an e&s;pecial judgment from Heaven upon him, for that fact, <HI>and perchance they were not much out of it: For it &s;eldom happening, in an affront given to any particular mode of wor&s;hip, how erroneous &s;oever it may be, but that religion is in general wound|ed thereby; there are many in&s;tances in hi&s;tory, wherein God hath very &s;ignally puni&s;hed the profanations of religion in the wor&s;t of times, and under the wor&s;t mode of heathen idolatry.</HI>" Wood proceeds thus, "The works of impiety that Whit|tingham performed, while he &s;at dean of Durham, were very many, among

He al&s;o cau&s;ed the image of St Cuthbert, (which before had been removed from its proper place by dean Robert Horn, who al&s;o had a hand in &s;uch impieties) and al&s;o other ancient monuments to be defaced and broken all to pieces, to the intent that there &s;hould be no memory of that holy man, or of any other who had been famous in the church, and great benefactors thereto, (as the priors his predece&s;&s;ors were) left whole and undefaced. I &s;ay it again, that he did this to the end, that no memory or token of that holy man, St Cuthbert, &s;hould be left, who was &s;ent and brought thither by the power and will of Almighty God, and was thereupon the oc|ca&s;ion of the erection of the mona&s;tical church of Durham, where the clergy and &s;ervants have all their livings and commodities from that time to this day. At length, after his many rambles in this world, both beyond and within the &s;eas, and his too forward zeal for promoting his Calvini&s;tical (if not wor&s;e) opinions, whereby much mi&s;chief happened to the church of England, he did unwillingly (being then full of worldly troubles) &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the &s;troke of death, on the 10th day of June, 1579, and was buried in the cathedral church of Durham; &s;oon after was a tomb-&s;tone laid over his grave, with an epitaph of twelve long and &s;hort ver&s;es, engraven on a bra&s;s plate, fa&s;tened thereto; which, with mo&s;t, if not all of the monuments, which were &s;et up after his time, were mi&s;erably defaced by the Scots, when they invaded England, in 1640.

Wood, was likely to be given to dean Whit|tingham, &s;o noted a Puritan, that he has many an ill word from that Oxonian, who however &s;ays of him, had he &s;tirred in it, and made intere&s;t with his friend Robert, earl of Leice&s;ter, he might have obtained it.</Q> Bancroft, another &s;uch rigid doctor as Whitgift, in a treati&s;e of his, &s;tiles Whittingham <Q><HI>the fal&s;e, un|worthy dean of Durham,</HI> for taking upon him that deanry, when he was only ma&s;ter of arts, and, by the &s;tatutes of the church at Durham, he &s;hould have been a doctor or bachelor of divinity: With &s;uch &s;traws are the&s;e men's heads &s;tuffed. It gave al&s;o great offence, that he &s;hould content him&s;elf with a Geneva ordi|nation, and for this they did not forbear injuring him, in &s;aying he encouraged Knox and Goodman, in &s;etting up &s;edition in Scotland; for the &s;ettlement made by Knox in Scotland, was the reformed religion, and not &s;edition. Dr Sandys, now archbi&s;hop of York, &s;u&s;pecting that the gentle hand of Dr Pilkington, late bi&s;hop of Durham, had given the Puritans too much encouragement in that dioce&s;e, re&s;olved to vi&s;it it him&s;elf, Dr Barnes, the new bi&s;hop, having complain|ed to him, of the number of non-conformi&s;ts, whom he could not reduce to the orders of the church. But whatever his pretence was for this grand vi&s;itation, the real de&s;ign was &s;uppo&s;ed to be again&s;t Whittingham, whom Sandys valued not the more for having been a fellow exile with him in Germany, in the bloody reign of queen Mary. He was a divine of great learning, an admirer of Calvin and the church of Geneva, which the late honourable and reverend Dr Compton, bi&s;hop of London, &s;tiled his brethren, in a letter he wrote to them, and which the Laudeans treat with contempt or indignation, as &s;chi&s;matics. It &s;eems dean Whittingham had only had Geneva ordination, which I believe as much, as that the &s;un is now &s;hining in a very fine day, is by the bulk of the inferior clergy, and younger academics, at this time looked upon to be no more an ordination than that of a ve&s;try would be. There were thirty-four other articles again&s;t him; but that was like an ignorant ru&s;tic's in&s;i&s;ting to have a fellow hanged for &s;tealing his goo&s;e, when he had ju&s;t been convicted of burglary: The latter was &s;ufficient to hang him, and the goo&s;e afterwards not worth mentioning. If he was no prie&s;t, as archbi&s;hop Sandys urged, on account of his foreign ordination, that would have outed him of cour&s;e, and then what &s;ignified the other roll of articles: But the dean, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the charge, &s;tood by the rights of the church of Durham, and denied the archbi&s;hop's power of vi&s;itation; upon which
<PB N="148" REF="160">
the archbi&s;hop excommunicated him, that is, denied him the privilege and benefit of receiving the Lord's &s;upper. The dean appealed to the queen, who directed a commi&s;&s;ion to the archbi&s;hop, to the lord pre&s;ident of the North, and to the dean of York, to hear and determine the validity of his orders, and to enquire into the other mi&s;demeanors contained in the articles: The lord pre&s;i|dent was a favourer of the Puritans, and Dr Hutton, dean of York, of Whit|tingham's principles, and boldly averred, that the dean was ordained in a better &s;ort than even the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf; &s;o that the commi&s;&s;ion came to nothing. Sandys, vexed at the di&s;appointment, and at calling in que&s;tion his right of vi&s;i|tation, the reader &s;ees how it goes, the power, the denomination, the &s;elf ever uppermo&s;t, obtained another commi&s;&s;ion, directed to him&s;elf, to the bi&s;hop of Durham, the lord pre&s;ident, (he mu&s;t come after notwith&s;tanding his precedency) the chancellor of the dioce&s;e, and &s;ome others, whom he could depend upon, to vi&s;it the church of Durham: The aim of Sandys and Barnes was to deprive Whittingham of his deanry, as a layman. When the dean appeared before the commi&s;&s;ioners, he produced a certificate under the hands of eight per&s;ons, for the manner of his ordination; upon which the lord pre&s;ident ro&s;e up, and &s;aid, I cannot in con&s;cience agree to deprive him for that cau&s;e only, for it will be ill taken by all the godly and learned, both at home and abroad, that we &s;hould allow of the popi&s;h ma&s;&s;ing prie&s;ts in our mini&s;try, and di&s;allow of mini&s;ters made in a reformed church; upon which the commi&s;&s;ion was adjourned <HI>&s;ine die.</HI>&mdash; One cannot help ob&s;erving here, how the noble and the wi&s;e abhorred per&s;ecu|tion, and how enlarged their minds were in compari&s;on with the lordly eccle|&s;ia&s;tics. The&s;e proceedings of the archbi&s;hop again&s;t the dean were invidious, and lo&s;t him his e&s;teem, both in city and county. Be&s;ides the calling the dean's ordination in que&s;tion, was contrary to the &s;tatute 13th Elizabeth, by which the ordinations of foreign reformed churches were declared valid; and tho&s;e that had no other orders, were made of like capacities with others, to enjoy any place of mini&s;try within England. It is &s;trange the archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hop of Durham, among other articles again&s;t the dean, did not think of that mentioned by Wood, the Oxonian, who doubtle&s;s thought it of the highe&s;t im|portance, which was, that he was only graduated ma&s;ter of arts, whereas the &s;tatutes of the church of Durham required, that the dean &s;hould be a bachelor of divinity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. v. p. 120.</NOTE>.

<P>The &s;aid Grey and Smith appearing before the lords of the council, did acknowledge, that what was alleaged again&s;t them was true as to the &s;ub&s;cribing the petition; but declared they had cau&s;e to complain again&s;t the Dean and Chapter, for that contrary to a decree entred in the court of York and el&s;ewhere, in the time of queen Elizabeth, which did a&s;certain their right in the renewing their lea&s;es, with &s;avyor to them in re&s;pect of their tenant right; and that a &s;mall fine (in compari&s;on of what the Dean and Chapter now required of them) had wont to be paid, of which, they &s;aid, they often complained as a grievance, but never obtained hopes of relief from them.</P>
<P>The council-board, after hearing the bu&s;ine&s;s, declared them&s;elves di&s;&s;atisfied with the tenants' proceed|ings, and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury moved, that the Dean and Chapter might do well to proceed again&s;t them in the Star Chamber, and never to renew their lea&s;es to the tenants, or the children of them who did complain; and that it were fit they &s;hould be committed to pri&s;on till they did produce the &s;chedule of grievances &s;ub&s;cribed by the tenants, to di&s;cover their names; and that they &s;hould pay &s;o much money as they received from tho&s;e tenants (who impowered them to pro&s;ecute this their complaint) to one of the clerks of the council, and that nothing &s;hould be deducted out of the &s;ame, to allow the &s;aid Grey and Smith any thing towards the defraying of their charges or monies laid out about the pro&s;ecution of this bu&s;ine&s;s; for, &s;aid the archbi&s;hop, he was confident it was a practice again&s;t the church, and did believe there was &s;ome fur|ther de&s;ign in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Hereupon the council-board ordered, that Grey and Smith be committed to the gatehou&s;e, and there to lie in pri&s;on, until they produce a &s;chedule of the names of the &s;ub&s;cribers, and that they did pay the money they had confe&s;&s;ed to have received, (which was about the &s;um of eighty pounds) unto the hands of Sir William Beecher, one of the clerks of the council; which they paid accordingly, but continued in pri&s;on many weeks, becau&s;e they would not deliver up the li&s;t of the tenants names that &s;ub&s;cribed the petition; but a parliament meeting April 13 next following, they were &s;et at liberty by the council-board, without delivering up the li&s;t of the tenants' names, and the paper of &s;ub&s;cription containing their grievances.</P>

<P>This period of time mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over without ob&s;erving, that archbi&s;hop Laud was very urgent for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of decent regulations in the church &s;ervice, and particularly for placing the communion table at the ea&s;t end of the church, and enclo&s;ing it with a rail, to &s;ecure it from profanation and common bu&s;ine&s;s: But in 1641, the commons interpo&s;ing their authority in tho&s;e matters, the table was ordered to be removed, the rails taken away, the chancel levelled, ornaments to be di&s;u&s;ed, as ba&s;ons, tapers, candle&s;ticks, &amp;c. and that bowing at the hallowed name, towards the ea&s;t, &s;hould be forborn. In &s;hort, the hour was come, when religious veneration was extingui&s;hed, and &s;lovenline&s;s, di&s;order, and irreve|rence, &s;imilar to the rudene&s;s of a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, were tolerated in the churches<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The charges brought again&s;t Cofins (which in the annals of that bi&s;hop, p. 1178, were referred to this period of the work) were, <Q>That he &s;et up a marble altar with cherubims, in the cathedral of Durham; that this with the appurtenances, co&s;t two thou&s;and pounds; that this ornamental furniture, which he calls appurtenances, was a cope, the repre&s;entation of the Trinity, and God the Father in the figure of an old man. There was likewi&s;e &s;aid to be a crucifix, with a red beard and blue cap. The dean was likewi&s;e accu&s;ed for lighting two hundred wax candles about the altar on Candlemas-day: For forbidding the &s;inging any p&s;alms before or after &s;ermons: For making an anthem to be &s;ung of the three kings of Cologn, Ga&s;par, Balthazar, and Melchior; and for procuring a con&s;ecrated knife, only to cut the bread at the com|munion."&mdash;The an&s;wer Cofins gave in upon both, was to this effect, "That the communion table in the church of Durham, was not &s;et up by Cofins, but by the Dean and Chapter, many years before he was prebendary of that church; and that Smart, the accu&s;er, was one of that chapter; that by the public accounts &s;tanding upon the regi&s;ter, the charge did not amount to above a tenth part of what was pre|tended. That the copes u&s;ed in that church, were furni&s;hed long before Cofins' time; and that Smart was prebendary when they were bought, and allowed his &s;hare of the charge. That Cofins never approved the picture of the Trinity, or the image of God the Father in any figure; and that to his knowledge, there was no &s;uch repre&s;entation in the church of Durham. That the crucifix, with a blue cap and a golden beard, was nothing but the top of bi&s;hop Hatfield's tomb, which had &s;tood in the church above two hundred and fifty years; and that there was no &s;uch figure upon any of the copes, as is reported in Fuller's Hi&s;tory.

<DATE>17 April, 1646.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, they &s;uppo&s;ing, that the &s;aid booke might bee in one of the trunkes which were &s;ent to Hull, at the time of the di&s;traction upon the entringe of the Scotti&s;h armie, did &s;end an expre&s;&s;e me&s;&s;enger to Hull, with a letter to Sir Thomas Glemham, govenor of the towne intreating him to open the &s;aid trunkes before good witne&s;&s;es, and to &s;earch for the &s;aid chapter booke; as appeareth by their letter unto the &s;aid govenor.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the &s;aid govenor did find but one trunck of the churches there, in which the book of their chapter actes was not to be found, as appeareth by the letter and te&s;timony under the hands and &s;eals of tho&s;e who opened and &s;earched the &s;aid truncke, by the govenor's appointment.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the dean and prebendaries immediately after, &s;ent another expre&s;s me&s;&s;enger to Durham, with let|ters to their chapter clerke, requiring him at his perill to find out the &s;aid book, (who&s;e charge properly it is) or el&s;e to come up him&s;elf in per&s;on, and give &s;atisfaction to their lord&s;hips, why it could not be produced; as appeareth by their letters to the &s;aid chapter clarke.</P>
<P N="4">4. That their chapter clarke is not come up, but hath &s;ent his &s;ervant, who hath depo&s;ed before their lord|&s;hips &s;ome things, wherein he may be deceived; becau&s;e it is certain that he is mi&s;taken in depo&s;ing, that Dr Duncon was pre&s;ent at the making up of that trunk at Dr Clarke's hou&s;e, in which the &s;aid booke was &s;up|po&s;ed to be.</P>
<P N="5">5. And therefore they do &s;uppo&s;e, that that trunckeis lo&s;t, either by the negligence of the &s;aid chapter clarke, (hee being in the &s;hip where it was, and it being his proper charge to looke after it) or by the avarice of marrinets, who finding it weightie, (as being full of books) might &s;uppo&s;e it was filled either with money or plate; or, if it were left behind in the regi&s;try, (wher u&s;ually it remained) it might be torn and de&s;troyed by the Scotti&s;h &s;oldiers, who broke open both their trea&s;urie and regi&s;trie, defacinge and de&s;troying therein many evidences; and, in all probabilitie, would have done &s;o with all the re&s;t, if they had not been re&s;trained and &s;everely puni&s;hed by their officers, e&s;peciallie by &s;erieant major general Bailie.</P>
<P N="6">6. All thes things are ready to be depo&s;ed by the dean or prebendaries, which they well hope their lord&s;hips will ea&s;ily believe for the&s;e two rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="7">7. Fir&s;t, that the lo&s;&s;e of the truncke is mo&s;t prejudiciall and di&s;advantagious to them as having in it many of their leiger books, counterpanes of &s;eale, and other evidences and chartularies, which mu&s;t bee of invaluable lo&s;&s;e to the church of Durham; and they are confident, that the booke of acts would have cleared them very much concerning their proceedings with Mr Smart.</P>
<P N="8">8. Secondly, to &s;hew that they have u&s;ed their utmo&s;t diligence, they &s;hall produce unto your lord&s;hips all the warrants, which po&s;&s;iblie could be found in their regi&s;trie, for entering their actes into the &s;aid book.

<P>We, the commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;urvey, appointed and authori&s;ed for the &s;urvey of the &s;everal manors, lands, tenements, and hereditaments, of the late Dean and Chapter of the cathedral church of Chri&s;t and ble&s;&s;ed Mary the Virgin of Durham, by vertue of a commi&s;&s;ion to us granted, grounded upon an act of the commi&s;|&s;ioners of England, a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, for aboli&s;hing of deans, and deans and chapters, under the hands and &s;eals of five or more of the tru&s;tees in the &s;aid act nominated and appointed; having deliberately peru&s;ed &s;everal very ancient records, leger books, halmot court books, court rolls and accounts, belonging to the &s;aid Dean and Chapter, and yet remaining at Durham, and having al&s;o heard the depo&s;ition of many witne&s;&s;es produced, touching the cu&s;tomary e&s;tates in rever&s;ion, claimed by the pre&s;ent tenants of the &s;aid late Dean and Chapter, thereby, and by all other lawful ways and means to inform our&s;elves of the truth of the &s;aid claim, do in all humblene&s;s certify as follows.</P>
<P>Imprimis, We do find, that the &s;everal manors, town&s;hips, and villages of Bel&s;is, Billingham, Wolvi&s;ton, Newton Bewly, Bruntoft, Coopon Bewly, &amp;c. were part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the prior and convent of Dur|ham above&s;aid, and very anciently belonging to the &s;ame.&mdash;And we do hereby find, that it manife&s;tly appears from the year of our Lord 1500, that there were con&s;tantly (till the di&s;&s;olution of the &s;aid prior and convent, which was about the 28th year of king Henry the 8th) &s;everal Halmott courts holden for the &s;aid prior at &s;eve|ral times in the year, of and for the all or mo&s;t of the &s;aid manors and premi&s;&s;es, at which courts, the &s;everal tenants of and within the &s;aid manors, town&s;hips, and villages, came and entered their purcha&s;es, took ad|mi&s;&s;ions as heirs or widows re&s;pectively, as the ca&s;e required, and the entries thereof, were and are made <HI>cepit de Domino,</HI> &amp;c. &s;uch and &s;uch lands, <HI>faciendo Domino et vicini&s;que incumbent. &amp;c. reddendo et faciendo in omnibus prout, &amp;c.</HI> Such an one the la&s;t tenant, <HI>reddidit et facit</HI> and the like, as in copyholds and cu&s;tomary e&s;tates is u&s;ual, and as by exceeding many antient and con&s;tant precedents and entries, doth and may appear.</P>
<P>That afterwards, after the &s;aid prior and convent was &s;o di&s;&s;olved, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, rever&s;ions, privi|leges, and inheritances, ve&s;ted and &s;ettled by act of parliament, in the &s;aid king Henry the 8th and his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, and conferred over among&s;t other lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to a Dean and Chapter by him newly erected, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by his letters patents, bearing date the 16th day of May, in the 33d year of the reign of king Henry the 8th.</P>
<P>That after that, all the tenants of the &s;aid prior and convent, with all the &s;aid manors, villages, and town|&s;hips, becoming tenants of the &s;aid new erected Dean and Chapter, did continue their holds and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their &s;aid farmholds and land, and could not be prevailed withall by the &s;aid Dean and Chapter, to take lea&s;es for twenty-one years in writing, though but at the old rents, howbeit much laboured and endeavoured by them, as appeared by &s;ome few incon&s;iderable lea&s;es, made by them to &s;trangers of their lands, in the nature of concurrent lea&s;es, and of the rever&s;ions thereof, which yet were con&s;tantly, and are to this day enjoyed by the then pre&s;ent tenants, or their a&s;&s;igns, or &s;uch as do derive their intere&s;t, or have de&s;cended from them; the &s;aid le&s;&s;ees being employed, as it &s;eems, to terrify the &s;aid tenants from their old way of holding into new lea&s;es, who yet continued in that manner, paying and performing the antient yearly rents and &s;ervices accu&s;|tomed, and very few lea&s;es were taken, till the 15th or 16th year of the late queen Elizabeth's reign, as by the receipt books and rentals plainly appears.</P>
<P>That then many and great differences en&s;uing betwixt the &s;aid Dean and Chapter and their tenants, con|cerning their e&s;tates, cu&s;toms, and &s;ervices, and the manner of the holds, which the &s;aid Dean and Chapter endeavoured to have altered, the then honourable lords of her maje&s;ty's privy council, and the lords pre&s;ident and council of the north, who from her maje&s;ty was authori&s;ed to hear and determine all differences of that nature in the northern counties, called before them the &s;aid parties concerned; and upon full and deliberate hearing and con&s;ideration had of the &s;everal demands, objections, and an&s;wers, of all the &s;aid parties, and by and with the con&s;ent of the &s;aid Dean and Chapter; did for the further and quiet &s;ettlement of the &s;aid e&s;tates, cu&s;toms, holds, and &s;ervices, make, decree, declare, and &s;ett down their order, which was entered, as well in the books of orders and decrees of the &s;aid pre&s;ident and council, and of the privy council, as in the court of chancery at Durham, bearing date the 17th of Augu&s;t, in the 19th year of the reign of the &s;aid late queen Eliza|beth; thereby ordering among&s;t other things, <HI>that the &s;aid tenants &s;hould hold their lands and tenements from the &s;aid Dean and Chapter by lea&s;e for twenty-one years, and &s;o from twenty-one years to twenty-one years for ever, paying only three years fine at the mo&s;t for renewing a lea&s;e for twenty-one years as afore&s;aid;</HI> and in con&s;idera|tion thereof, the &s;aid tenants to continue the performance of their ancient and accu&s;tomed &s;ervice in the wars, with hor&s;e, man, and furniture, upon the borders and marches of England towards Scotland, for the &s;pace of fifteen days without wages, when the &s;aid Dean and Chapter or their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould require.</P>
<P>That the then Dean and Chapter in approbation thereof, and con&s;enting thereto, did confirm the &s;ame un|der their Chapter &s;eal, bearing date the 27th day of February, in the 20th year of the reign of the late queen, and in ob&s;ervation, and pur&s;uance of the &s;aid order, in relation to the three years fine therein &s;pecified; the &s;aid Dean and Chapter did, by their chapter act or grant, bearing date the 12th day of April, Anno Domini, 1626, order and appoint, <HI>that the &s;aid tenants &s;hould have their lea&s;es renewed from time to time without difficulty or delay, paying a year's fine every 7th year, without any other exaction or demand, which by true account, is three years fine for a lea&s;e for twenty-one years,</HI> as by the afore&s;aid order is limited and appointed.</P>
<P>And it doth al&s;o appear unto us, by the oaths of &s;everal per&s;ons produced and &s;worn thereby, and by all other lawful means, to inform our&s;elves of the truth of the claim made by the &s;aid tenants of a cu&s;tomary e&s;tate in rever&s;ion, in their tenements and farmholds after the expiration of their pre&s;ent lea&s;es: That the &s;aid tenants have accordingly had their lea&s;es renewed from twenty-one years to twenty-one years, and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at improvement, from time to time for twenty-one years, paying three years rent at the improved value, clear profit, ultra old rent and &s;ervice, as a fine for a lea&s;e for 21 years, and to pay and perform their ancient yearly rents and &s;ervices accu&s;tomed: And the &s;aid tenants have always had their lea&s;es renewed from twenty-one years to twenty-one years, and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at the improvement as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>And it al&s;o appeared by the evidence, upon oath of diver&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;worn and examined, that the &s;aid tenants right or tru&s;t in any e&s;tate in rever&s;ion &s;o claimed as afore&s;aid, of and in the premi&s;&s;es, was &s;o con&s;i|derable in the general repute of the inhabitants of that county and the parts adjacent, as that the &s;aid lands and tenements was u&s;ualy alienated and &s;old within three years value at the mo&s;t, of freehold and fee &s;imple lands; and that the &s;aid tenants did u&s;ualy alienate and &s;ell their &s;aid tenant right or cu&s;tomary e&s;tates for five years purcha&s;e at the lea&s;t; and that the &s;aid Dean and Chapter them&s;elves, even when all the term of years in &s;everal lea&s;es of the &s;aid tenants were expired, did offer five years purcha&s;e, and &s;ometimes more, to &s;uch tenants for their tenant right, or cu&s;tomary e&s;tate &s;o claimed as afore&s;aid, in ca&s;e &s;uch tenants were not willing or able to pay the u&s;ual fine for renewing their &s;aid lea&s;es.</P>
<P>And it doth further manife&s;tly appear unto us, that the livelyhood and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of many hundred fami|lies in the &s;aid county, do &s;olely depend upon the &s;aid tenements and farmholds, and the benefit they expect by their &s;aid claim of a cu&s;tomary e&s;tate and tenant right as afore&s;aid; and that diver&s;e of the &s;aid tenants and their ance&s;tors have continued &s;ome hundreds of years in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their tenements, as it appears by the court rolls of the &s;aid late Dean and Chapter afore&s;aid.</P>

IN obedience to your lord&s;hip's order of the
<DATE>4th of Aprill, 1662,</DATE> the&s;e re&s;pondents &s;ay;</HEAD>
<P>That the petition which is not onely again&s;t the pre&s;ent Deane and Chapter, but again&s;t all their pre|dece&s;&s;ors from the fir&s;t foundation, hath not any thing in it, which is not either impertinent or fal&s;e, as wee are ready to prove in every particular.</P>
<P N="1">I. Whereas they call them&s;elves the auncient tenants of the Deane and Chapter of Durham, the fir&s;t of them is not &s;oe much as a tenant, but onely a purcha&s;er of a farme belonging to the &s;aid Deane and Chapter, which he purcha&s;ed of one that had formerly purcha&s;ed the &s;ayd farme from the tru&s;tees of the laite u&s;urpers, but was never the tenant of that farme to the Deane and Chapter: And as for all the re&s;t of the petitioners, who were formerly tenants to the Deane and Chapter, and do &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their lands, there is not one of them that wee knowe that hath any lea&s;e in being, or hath made any application to the re&s;pondents for the renewing of his lea&s;e, neither hath any one of them pay'd any rent to the church &s;ince the late pretended di&s;&s;olution of deanes and chapters, and &s;ome of them being required to pay their rents, an&s;were, that they have purcha&s;ed their rents.</P>
<P N="2">II. Whereas they alledge, that their ance&s;tors, and they under whom they hold, held their lands to them and their heires under certaine rents &s;ervyces, and cu&s;tomes by copy of court roll, alledgeing for proofe thereof our booke of entries; the&s;e re&s;pondents &s;ay, that they have &s;earched their booke of entries, and have not found any one tenant that ever held any of their lands to him and his heires, but onely for a terme of yeares, &s;ometymes &s;ix &s;ometymes nine, but for the mo&s;t parte but three, with condition to be obedient to the pryor and covent, and provi&s;oe (that if they dyed before that terme were expired) the grant to be voyd.</P>
<P N="3">III. Whereas they alledge, that ymediately after the di&s;&s;olution of the priory and covent, the Deane and Chapter endeavoureing generally to breake the &s;aid cu&s;tomes, prevayled with &s;ome, and con&s;trayned others to take lea&s;es; wee an&s;were that it is true, that ymediately after the di&s;&s;olution of the priory and covent, the Deane and Chapter did lett almo&s;t all their lands by lea&s;es, &s;ome for &s;ixty years, &s;ome for eighty and &s;ome for more, but generally for but one and twenty years, which way of holding, being much better for the tenants, then that which they had before, wee cannot under&s;tand, what need there was of any artifices or con&s;trainte to bring the tenants to that way of holding their lands.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Whereas they alledge an order of the lord pre&s;ident and councell of the north in the tyme of queene Elizabeth, wee an&s;were, fir&s;t, that there is a provi&s;oe in that order that nothing therein conteyned, &s;hould extend to &s;uch tenants as formerly held their lands by lea&s;e, but only to &s;uch as called them&s;elves tenants by cu&s;tomes, and were reputed by the Deane and Chapter to be onely tenants by curti&s;y: Secondly the order of the lords concerning tho&s;e tenants, was made in con&s;ideration of border &s;ervice, which is long &s;ince cea&s;ed: Thirdly, that the order of the lords was &s;o little in favoure of the tenants, that &s;ome of them refu&s;ed to take lea&s;es, according to that order, and others chu&s;e rather to take lea&s;es &s;imply: Fourthly, that all the lea&s;es for diver&s;e years &s;ince, are without any referrence to &s;uch order, and as if there never had beene any &s;uch order.</P>
<P N="5">V. Whereas it is alledged that the Deane and Chapter de&s;igneing to brake this way of holding, al&s;o devyded the whole deanery among them by lottery; we an&s;were, Fir&s;t, that the Deane and Chapter for diver&s;e years before the order of the lords, did divyde many lea&s;es among them&s;elves by lottery, but never &s;ince that order, and therefore it could not be with de&s;igne to breake that order: Secondly, that if the Deane and Chapter de|vyded the whole deanry by lottery, the petitioners cannot derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion beyond tho&s;e lotteryes, and therefore have not rea&s;on to complaine of them, nor pretence for holding from their aunce&s;tors before there was any Deane and Chapter as they alledge in the begining of their petition.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Whereas they alledge that &s;uch tenants as were brought to accept of lea&s;es from &s;uch prebendaries as they &s;ell unto by lott, paid but three yeares old rent for five or little more; it is fal&s;e that they paid but three years rent or little more, for compareing the fines with the old rents, wee finde the fines oftentimes above tenn times &s;oe much as the old rent, and &s;ometymes above twelve time &s;oe much, as for 2l 6s. 8d. rent, 30l. fine for a farme in Ayckliffe, in the name of Edward Thomp&s;on; and for 33s. 4d. rent, 20l. fine to Richard Hut|chin&s;on for a farme in Burdon; and for a tenement in We&s;tow, 2l. 15s. 4d. rent, 38l. fine, which is neare four|teene tymes the old rent, which con&s;idering the proportion that was then betweene the rent and the true value of the lands, and the great di&s;proportion, which is now by rea&s;on of the great increa&s;e of money, may be thought as great fines, as tho&s;e which have been demanded &s;ince.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Whereas they accu&s;e the&s;e re&s;pondents of not regarding his maje&s;ties late gracious declaration and letters, and the ju&s;t de&s;yres of the petitioners, which are to renew their lea&s;es without fine: Wee an&s;were, that wee conceive they have made this accu&s;ation generall, becau&s;e they are not able to in&s;tance any one particular; and we de&s;yre them to name any one tenant that hath made application to be, who hath not beene offered
<PB N="166" REF="178">more in con&s;ideration of his purcha&s;e, and demanded le&s;&s;e for fine, then is u&s;ualy offered and demanded by any church in England in treateing with their tenants.</P>
<P>Wee therefore humbly de&s;ire your lord&s;hips, that the petitioners may be required to make proofe of their allegations, which wee know they cannot; and although wee conceive wee are not bound to di&s;prove them, wee are ready to &s;hew the fal&s;ehoode of them, and the truth of every thing wee have affirmed, that it may ap|peare to your lord&s;hips, how impudently they have abu&s;ed his maje&s;tie, with a complicacion of many fal&s;e al|legacions, troubled your lord&s;hipps, and &s;landered theire landlords, by who&s;e favours they have enjoyed theire livelyhoods at &s;oe ea&s;ye a rate, as ought to have beene acknowledged by them with much thankfulnes.</P>

<P>a younger &s;on of the loyal and valiant Sir Bevil Granville, and brother to John, the fir&s;t earl of Bath of that family. After a &s;uitable education, in September, 1657, he was admitted a fellow commoner of Exeter College, in Oxford. On the 28th of September, 1660, was created ma&s;ter of arts; and &s;oon after, marrying Anne, younge&s;t daughter of bi&s;hop Co&s;ins, was collated by his lord&s;hip on the 16th of September, 1662, to the archdeaconry of Durham; and to the fir&s;t prebend in the cathedral church, which he exchanged for the &s;econd, April 16, 1668. He had al&s;o, of his gift, the rectories of Ea&s;ington and Elwick; and in the room of the latter, the living of Sedgefield. But he took a very regular and exemplary care of them, in the due di&s;charge of all mini&s;terial functions, as appears by the directions given to his curates, printed among his works, On the 20th of December, 1670, he was created doctor in divinity, being then chaplain in ordinary to his maje&s;ty, as he had been for &s;everal years before; and on the 14th of December, 1684, was in|&s;talled dean of Durham. Thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch great preferments, he might have long enjoyed them with much profit and honour to him&s;elf and friends; and have continued to be an ornament to his function, and a general benefit to the world: But &s;ome ab&s;urd notions entertained of the unlimited extent of the prero|gative, together with his &s;trict adherence to the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, involved him in inextricable difficulties. For, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the

indi&s;pen&s;ablene&s;s of their obligation, upon the prince of Orange coming to re&s;cue this nation from the dangerous attempts made upon our religion and liberties, the dean oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures taken for our common &s;afety to the utmo&s;t of his power; by preaching, delivering charges to the clergy, &s;ending up an addre&s;s to king James, and &s;ub&s;cribing a &s;um of money for his &s;ervice. And when all his endeavours proved ineffectual, he was &s;o entangled with tho&s;e ab&s;urd doctrines, that, rather than &s;ubmit to king William, he cho&s;e to lo&s;e his great preferments, and go into a voluntary exile; and, quitting Durham the 11th December, 1688, he arrived the 19th of March following, at Honfleur, in France. In February, 1689, he took a hazardous journey to England, whereby he got a &s;mall &s;upply of money, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t abroad. His brother, the earl of Bath, (who was warm in the intere&s;t of the prince of Orange) endeavoured for &s;ome time to &s;ecure his revenues; but as no con|&s;iderations whatever could induce him to &s;wear allegiance to king William and queen Mary, he was at length deprived of all his preferments, February 1, 1690. He not only refu&s;ed him&s;elf, but likewi&s;e did all in his power to deter, or rather to terrify others from taking the oaths, by repre&s;enting the revolution as a rebellion and u&s;urpation. Having no pro&s;pect, after the late king James's defeat in Ireland, of recovering his benefices, he repaired to the abdicated monarch's court, at St Germain; where, though he had rea&s;on to expect an uncommonly kind reception, yet, becau&s;e he was a prote&s;tant, he was &s;oon obliged to retire, not only from court, but al&s;o from the town. 'Tis &s;aid, that upon the death of Dr Lamplugh, he had the empty title of archbi&s;hop of York conferred upon him by king James. In 1695, he came incognito to England, where he found no encouragement to make any &s;tay. Having for &s;ome years enjoyed but an indifferent &s;tate of health, he died at his lodgings in Paris, the 8th of April, 1703, aged 64, and was buried at the lower end of the church-yard of the Holy Innocents in that city. His nephew, lord Lan&s;|down, draws his character to great advantage in the following words:&mdash;<Q>Sanctity &s;ate &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o unaffected, and &s;o graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very beauty of holine&s;s. He was as chearful, as familiar, as conde&s;cending in his conver&s;ation, as he was &s;trict, regular, and exemplary in his piety; as well|bred and accompli&s;hed as a courtier, and as reverend and as venerable as an apo&s;tle. He was indeed apo&s;tolical in every thing, for he abandoned all to follow his lord and ma&s;ter.</Q> From this man's example, we may learn the great dan|ger and mi&s;chief of propagating ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable doctrines. Since there will always be found &s;ome per&s;on or other, that will embrace and &s;tiffly defend them, though never &s;o much to their own, or others prejudice: All not being equally endowed with the &s;ame penetrating genius, or not having a yielding con|&s;cience alike <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See Biog.

The fir&s;t of his being noted to us is under the patronage of bi&s;hop Morton, who ordained him deacon and prie&s;t whil&s;t bi&s;hop of Litchfield, and made him his chaplain: In September, 1636, he was collated to the church of Eggle&s;cliff; in July, 1640, he had the degree of doctor in divinity conferred upon him at Cambridge, by mandate, and was incor|porated in the &s;ame at Oxford, in November following; about which time he was made chaplain in ordinary to king Charles I.

During his travels he collated the &s;everal confe&s;|&s;ions of faith of the different &s;orts of Chri&s;tians, Greeks, Armenians, Jacobites, Maro|nites, &amp;c. which he kept by him in their own languages: In his travels he endured many hard&s;hips, particularly in 1653, he pa&s;&s;ed from Aleppo to Con&s;tantinople by land, being 600 miles, without either &s;ervant, or Chri&s;tian, or any man with him, that could &s;peak the Frank language; yet, by the help of &s;ome Arabic acquired at Aleppo, he performed that journey in the company of twenty Turks, who&s;e courte&s;y

At the age of eighteen he was placed at Emanuel College, Cambridge, and matriculated in the year 1634: In 1637, was admitted to the degree of bachelor of arts; and ma&s;ter of arts in 1641; the year following, was elected a fellow of his college; and took the degree of bache|lor in divinity in 1648, but, refu&s;ing to take the covenant, was ejected from his fel|low&s;hip in the year 1649; upon which he went abroad, and became intimately ac|quainted with the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Engli&s;h loyali&s;ts then in exile. In 1660, he was cho&s;en one of the univer&s;ity preachers, though it appears he was at Rome when king Charles II. returned to England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>A MS. of Mr Henry Wharton.&mdash;In a MS. vol. of collections now in St John's College library, Oxford, by Dr Rawlin&s;on, the following is ob&s;ervable:&mdash;<Q>Wm Sancroft, at Padua, entered a &s;tudent as appears by a te&s;timonial, &s;igned by the pro-rector and Syndik, 10th March, 1660.</Q> Pre&s;. to Coll.

Soon after the Re&s;toration, Dr Sancroft came home, and bi&s;hop Co&s;in, who knew him abroad, appointed him one of his chaplains; and on the 7th of December, 1661, he was collated to the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring, in which year he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in renewing the liturgy. By mandamus, he was created doctor in divinity in the month of March, 1661-2; and on the 14th of Augu&s;t following, was elected ma&s;ter of Emanuel College, which he governed with great propriety. In the beginning of the year 1663-4, the doctor was promoted to the deanry of York, which he held but a &s;hort time, yet long enough to expend 200l. more than the revenue produced, in repairs and other incident charges; during that &s;hort period bringing the church accounts into excellent order. On the death of Dr John Barwick, in 1664, he was removed to the deanry of St Paul's, &s;oon after which he re&s;igned Houghton, and the ma&s;ter&s;hip of Emanuel. He now gave much attention to the repairs of his church, till the fire, in 1666, occa&s;ioned all his thoughts to be employed in rebuilding that fabric, to which he contributed 1400l. be&s;ides un|wearied endeavours to promote a &s;ub&s;cription: He rebuilt the deanry hou&s;e, and improved the revenue thereof, as well as other livings in his gift, as dean. In 1668, he was admitted archdeacon of Canterbury, on the king's pre&s;entation, which he re&s;igned in 1670. In 1677, being then prolocutor of the convocation, he was ad|vanced by king Charles II. to the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, in which mo&s;t con|&s;picuous character, &s;urrounded with the perils and errors of the times, he conducted him&s;elf with &s;ingular prudence, per&s;picuity, and religious virtue: His revenues were not di&s;&s;ipated in luxury and o&s;tentation, but di&s;po&s;ed in works of charity, muni|ficence,
<PB N="205" REF="217">
and ho&s;pitality. He re&s;igned this &s;tall in 1674, having rebuilt the preben|dal hou&s;e. He attended king Charles II. on his death bed, when it is &s;aid, he made &s;ome remon&s;trances, and pre&s;&s;ed &s;undry exhortations on the &s;overeign, towards which the complexion of the court had warmed his &s;pirit. In 1686, the doctor re|fu&s;ed to act in the commi&s;&s;ion i&s;&s;ued by king James II. for eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; and in 1688, was committed to the Tower, with &s;ix other bi&s;hops, for pre&s;enting a peti|tion to the king, again&s;t reading his maje&s;ty's declaration of indulgence. The court pronouncing this petition libellous, on the 29th of June the prelates were tried for a mi&s;demeanour, but, to the general &s;atisfaction of the nation, were acquitted. He engaged his good offices for the di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants, fore&s;eeing the revolution that was approaching. On the 3d of October, accompanied with eight bi&s;hops, he at|tended the king, who had demanded their coun&s;el, and then, with a freedom virtue only in&s;pires, urged the mo&s;t &s;erious and important advice to his &s;overeign, touch|ing the unhappy &s;ituation of the &s;tate. A few days after, though very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by his maje&s;ty, he refu&s;ed to &s;ign a declaration of abhorrence of the Prince of Orange's de&s;igns; and on the 17th of November, he joined in another petition, for a free parliament. On the king's abdication, he &s;igned, and concurred with the lords &s;piritual and temporal, a&s;&s;embled at Guildhall, in a declaration to the Prince of Orange for a free parliament, &s;ecurity of our laws, liberties, and properties, and of the church of England in particular, with a due indulgence to Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters: But when that prince and his con&s;ort were declared king and queen, he refu&s;ed to take the oaths to their maje&s;ties, was &s;u&s;pended the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1689, and deprived the 1&s;t of February following. The above fact counteracts all the principles he ap|peared to have adopted, and leaves his character under &s;u&s;picion, or marked with duplicity, in&s;incerity, and want of truth. The editor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Gutch.</NOTE> of the Collectanea Curio&s;a, embarra&s;&s;ed at this point, &s;ays, <Q>As for the archbi&s;hop's character, let it be learned from his actions; for if we go for it to the writers of oppo&s;ite parties, it will ap|pear, in different hands, as different as po&s;&s;ible. He certainly gave the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance po&s;&s;ible of &s;incerity, in &s;acrificing the highe&s;t dignities, and other the greate&s;t advantages, to what he thought truth and hone&s;ty.</Q> He continued at Lambeth till June, 1691, and then retired to his native place, where he &s;pent the remainder of his life in &s;trict retirement, and died on the 24th of November, 1693, aer. 77.

He was al&s;o principally concerned in pub|li&s;hing an excellent edition of <HI>Stephens's The&s;aurus.</HI> In 1739, he accepted the rectory of Gray&s;toke, to which he was pre&s;ented by the univer&s;ity. When Mr Howard, now duke of Norfolk, &s;old the advow&s;on, he &s;tipulated with the purcha&s;er in favour of Mr Law, for a pre&s;entation from a Prote&s;tant patron. Mr Law accordingly re|&s;igned this rectory, and had a new pre&s;entation from Dr A&s;kew, the purcha&s;er. This allowed him to remove to Salkeld, the corps of the archdeaconry of Carli&s;le, a much more healthy &s;ituation, given him by bi&s;hop Fleming. While in Cumber|land, he publi&s;hed <HI>Con&s;iderations on the Theory of Religion,</HI> which has gone through &s;everal editions; <HI>Litigiou&s;ne&s;s repugnant to the Laws of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> an a&s;&s;ize &s;ermon, at Carli&s;le, and a charge on the <HI>Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of Catechi&s;ing.</HI> In 1747, he proceeded to doctor in divinity: The divinity &s;chool was unu&s;ually crowded, and the rigidly orthodox were &s;o alarmed at his que&s;tion, that it gave occa&s;ion to much al|tercation afterwards, in a variety of publications; but he him&s;elf, unwilling to give further offence, <Q>thought it a part of Chri&s;tian prudence not to be more explicit on the &s;ubject, till men appear more willing to &s;ubmit their vain philo&s;ophy to the authority of God's word, and are di&s;po&s;ed to examine things with greater atten|tion

He &s;erved the office of vice-chancellor, in 1756, and, having a numerous family, he afterwards accepted the office of principal librarian, and that of ca&s;ui&s;tical profe&s;&s;or; and had al&s;o the archdeaconry of Stafford, and a &s;tall in the church of Lincoln, given him on his promotion to the See of Carli&s;le, in 1769; he kept the head&s;hip of his college, and had the rectory of Grey&s;toke <HI>in commendam.</HI>&mdash; He publi&s;hed only two or three &s;ermons afterwards; but, though advanced to a great age, &s;uch was his veneration for the great Mr Locke, and his love for freedom of en|quiry, that he &s;urpri&s;ed the world with an excellent edition of the works of that great philo&s;opher in four volumes, folio.&mdash;He is &s;till living.</P>

<P>AFTER a tedious arrangement of the &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics who &s;at in this church, the reader's attention is required to a de&s;cription of the &s;acred edifices, with a comparative view of their ancient &s;tate and ornaments.</P>
<P>The traveller is conducted to this cathedral by the Place or Place-Green, where the whole north front lies open to the view. The &s;ituation is &s;ingularly grand and noble, the building &s;tretching along the crown of an eminence, about eighty feet perpendicular from the &s;urface of the river, which wa&s;hes its ba&s;e; on the ea&s;t &s;ide
<PB N="226" REF="238">
the Bailey intervenes between the church and the brink of the hill; and on the we&s;t this venerable pile ri&s;es on the points of rocks, which &s;hew them&s;elves on the &s;um|mit of the mount, and almo&s;t overhangs the &s;tream: On this elevated ground the whole edifice has the mo&s;t &s;triking and augu&s;t appearance. The towers to the we&s;t were anciently crowned with &s;pires, covered with lead; the windows of the nave are under circular arches, of the original model; in the other parts (excepting the upper tier of the choir) mo&s;t of them are of a different form and age. This front is now under repair, the &s;tones being all chi&s;&s;eled over, and the decayed parts re&s;tored; the towers will receive new decorations, very different from the ancient ones, and the niches be &s;upplied with new &s;culptures; the expence is e&s;timated at thirty thou&s;and pounds, to be paid out of the Chapter's trea&s;ury:&mdash;A di&s;tingui&s;hed act of public munificence!</P>
<P>As the propo&s;ed changes will effectually remove from the traveller's eye the ancient appearance of this edifice, it was thought expedient to pre&s;ent the public with a re|pre&s;entation of the church in the &s;tate it was before the repairs began; and not|with&s;tanding the elegance of the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, it is apprehended &s;ome of the ornaments might have been cho&s;en with greater propriety: Above the great win|dow of the middle tran&s;ept, in two roundels, were the figures of Benedictine monks, cut in relief; by the mode of the &s;culpture, expre&s;&s;ive of the age of the building. They led the judicious eye immediately to the aera, and gave an example of the &s;tate of that art: The&s;e roundels are now &s;upplied with two fine new figures&mdash;the one a prior, &s;eated in his in&s;tallation chair; the other, an effigy of bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, cut from the figure on his epi&s;copal &s;eal, as given in the plate of his charter to the city of Durham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 13.</NOTE>. A century after this the figures will betray the &s;pectator into an error, and lead him to determine, that this part of the &s;tructure was erected, or at lea&s;t rebuilt, by that prelate. On the we&s;t corner tower of the ea&s;t tran&s;ept, were the effigies of tho&s;e per&s;onages who attended the propitious cow, by which the monks di&s;covered this &s;eat of ea&s;e and magnificence; the cut &s;hews the rece&s;s and &s;culp|tures in their decayed &s;tate, the figures being now re&s;tored and fini&s;hed with much

art. The great tower of the church, as remarked in the preceding part of this work, is much more modern than the re&s;t, being built as high as the gallery, by prior Mel&s;anby, who acceded in the year 1233, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, prior Middleton: Prior Hugh, of Darlington, who was elected in 1258, fini&s;hed the work, by build|ing the belfrey or upper tower. The tabernacle work, pointed arches, and ornament on the out&s;ides of the building, confirm tho&s;e dates; for then the Gothic &s;tile was in general acceptation: The buttre&s;&s;es of the tower are graced with niches canopied and fini&s;hed with tabernacle work, in which are &s;tatues repre&s;enting the great patrons of the See, in tolerable &s;culpture. The height of this tower, Willis &s;ays, is two hundred and twenty-three feet, de&s;cribing the lanthern to be one hundred and &s;ixty-two feet, and the belfrey &s;ixty-one feet; but Mr Nichol&s;on's admea&s;urement, which is mo&s;t to be depended upon, makes the whole height two hundred and fourteen feet, that is, the dome or lanthern one hundred and &s;ixty, and the bel|frey fifty-four feet.</P>
<P>It appears that the Place-Green, before prior Algar's time, in 1109, was crowd|ed with hou&s;es, and to him we owe that great elegance of an open area between the cathedral and ca&s;tle, giving the two edifices at once to the &s;pectator's view; he hav|ing cau&s;ed the buildings to be removed, and the ground to be reduced to a plain. The entrance to the church was by a portico, of much more modern work than the re&s;t of the building, formed by pila&s;ters and circular arches, the upper &s;tructure &s;upported by flanking buttre&s;&s;es, from whence &s;prung a pointed arch, the whole terminating at a point in the center: The arms of queen Elizabeth, in &s;tucco work, were placed on the divi&s;ion of two circular arches, where formerly were the win|dows of a &s;mall chapel: The portico, during the late repairs, was rebuilt and highly ornamented: There were anciently two chambers above the north door, where per&s;ons were lodged to hear the call of &s;uch as came to claim &s;anctuary, and who rang the bell to give notice thereof; after which the fugitive was &s;ecure from &s;e|cular authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In ancient time, before the hou&s;e was &s;uppre&s;t, the abbey church, the church-yard, and all the circuit thereof, was a &s;anctuary for all manner of men that committed any great offence, as killing of a man in his own defence, or any pri&s;oners who had broken out of pri&s;on, and fled to the church door, knocking to have it opened: Al&s;o certain men lay in two chambers over the north door for that purpo&s;e, that when any &s;uch of|fenders came and knocked, they in&s;tantly let them in at any hour of the night; and run quickly to the galilee bell, and tolled it, that who&s;oever heard it might know that &s;ome had taken &s;anctuary When the prior had notice thereof, he &s;ent orders to keep them&s;elves within the &s;anctuary; that is, within the church and church|yard, and that every one &s;hould have a gown of black cloth, with a yellow cro&s;s, called St Cuthbert's cro&s;s, at the left &s;houlder, that every one might &s;ee the privilege granted to St Cuthbert's &s;hrine, for offenders to fly unto for &s;uccour, and &s;afeguard of their lives, till they could obtain their prince's pardon: And that they &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> within the church or &s;anctuary, on a grate, made only for that purpo&s;e, adjoining to the galilee &s;outh door.

<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;ent to the reader a di&s;&s;ertation on the ancient modes of architecture, to elucidate a de&s;cription of the work, in the various parts of this edifice; the age of it is known, and the alterations made therein are almo&s;t criti|cally a&s;certained: What we commonly call the Saxon architecture in &s;uch edifices, is in fact Roman; for tho&s;e who con&s;tructed the religious buildings which aro&s;e in the earlie&s;t aera of the Norman acce&s;&s;ion, formed them after the models of workmen procured from the continent, (&s;poken of by Richard, prior of Hexham, l. i. cha. 3.) and came over to con&s;truct our capital buildings, expre&s;sly "according to the Roman manner." This &s;tile prevailed till about the conclu&s;ion of king Henry the Fir&s;t's reign, when, what we now call Gothic was in&s;troduced into Britain, &s;o that in this church we find &s;ome &s;trokes of the improved &s;tile; for as the building was begun in 1093, &s;o it was many years before it was completed: The walls were le&s;t unroo&s;ed by bi&s;hop Flambard at his death; and the reader will recollect that bi&s;hop William brought the de&s;ign with him from Normandy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vol. i. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE>. The ingenious traveller Mr Pennant, &s;ays, "In the in&s;ide is pre&s;erved much of the clum&s;y, yet venerable magnificence of the early Norman &s;tile." The gateway, which is ten feet wide, is ornamented within on each hand with pila&s;ters; the inner one, or that neare&s;t the gate, very richly embo&s;&s;ed with foliage, and figures in a light and ele|gant &s;tile; the other plain: The inclining arches are &s;emi-circular; the inner mem|bers carved in the zig-zag figure; the outward one embatteled or dentelled. The venerable pile &s;trikes the vi&s;itor on his entrance with an awful &s;olemnity not to be expre&s;&s;ed; the &s;tately and ma&s;&s;ive columns, the long extended ailes, the gloom which &s;hadows the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of arches, all contribute to affect the mind with an at|tention be&s;t known by being experienced: Ideas ari&s;e replete with the di&s;tant an|tiquity of the place, the piety of tho&s;e from whom the &s;tructure had its origin, and the devotion which warmed the brea&s;ts of the religious who&s;e characteri&s;tic virtues &s;hone forth in the holy places. The plan or de&s;ign of this building is more regu|lar than generally to be found in &s;tructures of the like age: The length of the whole church within, exclu&s;ive of the gallilee, is four hundred and eleven feet; that of the nave, from the we&s;t window to the center of the columns which &s;upport the tower, is two hundred feet, and its width &s;eventy-four feet, of which the center aile, from ba&s;e to ba&s;e of the pillars, is twenty-eight feet. The &s;uper&s;tructure is &s;upport|ed on two rows of columns. Mr Pennant &s;ays, the pillars are va&s;t cylinders twenty-three feet in circumference: The two extreme columns to the we&s;t ri&s;e from ba&s;es of the form of a complicated cro&s;s, having pointed projections from the interior angles; the dimen&s;ions of each ba&s;e are fifteen feet every way, being exactly &s;imilar
<PB N="229" REF="241">
to tho&s;e which &s;upport the columns of the tower and dome, vulgarly called the lanthern; the pillars are clu&s;tered, having three &s;emi-circular pila&s;ters in each front, divided by an angular projection: The next column ea&s;tward ri&s;es from a ba&s;e of the form of a cro&s;s, twelve feet each way, &s;upporting a clu&s;tered pillar, the pila&s;ters of which, towards the center aile, run up to the roof through the facia, between the upper windows; the next ri&s;es from a &s;quare ba&s;e of eight feet, and is richly fluted, terminating with a plain capital, which &s;upports the gallery above the &s;ide aile: Each intermediate pillar is clu&s;tered like tho&s;e de&s;cribed in the &s;econd place, &s;tretch|ing up to the roof, and tho&s;e in the intervals are circular, making the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;t of a clu&s;tered pillar, and a round one alternately; the fir&s;t round pillar is fluted as before de&s;cribed, the &s;econd covered with the zig-zag figure, and the third grooved with the figure of a net. The pillars oppo&s;ite to each other are exact|ly &s;imilar in ornaments and dimen&s;ions: It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, the clu&s;tered and round pillars through all the building have their ba&s;es of the dimen&s;ions before &s;et forth: All the &s;ide walls are decorated with pila&s;ters oppo&s;ite to the columns, and the interior &s;paces under the windows are filled with double pila&s;ters and inter&s;ect|ing round arches throughout the whole building, except only in the ea&s;t tran&s;ept. The arches between the great columns are all &s;emi-circular, the outward members dentelled, the interiors zig-zag'd: The under gallery opens to the middle aile, with one round arch divided within into two arches, &s;upported on a center pillar. There is an upper gallery of &s;ingle arches. At the we&s;t end of the nave is a &s;hort cro&s;s aile or tran&s;cept, in length ninety feet, and eighteen feet wide from the cen|ters of the columns, over the ends of which ri&s;e the we&s;t towers; according to Willis, one hundred and fifty-eight feet in height, but by Nichol&s;on's admea&s;ure|ment only one hundred and thirty-eight feet. At the end of each &s;ide aile is a gate|way, which opens into the gallilee. The ancient ornaments of the north aile are pointed out to the reader in the notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the entrance of the north aile was a trellice door from pillar to pillar, which opened and &s;hut with two leaves, like a folding door. Above it was likewi&s;e trelliced almo&s;t to the height of the vault, and on the top of the &s;aid trellice were iron pikes, that none &s;hould climb over it: It was never opened but on holidays, and at proce&s;&s;ions; and the north rood on the other &s;ide of the &s;ame pillar, at the north end of Je&s;us' altar, was likewi&s;e never opened but to admit &s;ome proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There were two holy water &s;tones belonging the church, of a fine blue marble; the be&s;t &s;tood within and oppo&s;ite to the north church door, fixed in the corner of the pillar adjoining to the Lady of Pittie's altar, on the left hand as you turn into the gallilee, having a beautiful &s;creen of wain&s;cot, finely painted with blue and little gilt &s;tars: It was kept very clean and fre&s;h water always provided again&s;t Sunday morning, hallow|ed before divine &s;ervice by one of the monks.</P>
<P>The other &s;tood within the &s;outh door, and &s;upplied with fre&s;h water every Sunday morning. That at the &s;outh door, &s;erved the prior, the convent, and the whole hou&s;e; the other being for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who came that way to hear divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There was between two pillars, on the left hand, in the north aile, as you go into the gallilee from the north door, our Lady of Pittie's altar, inclo&s;ed on each &s;ide with wain&s;cot, with the picture of our lady &s;up|porting our Saviour on her knee, as he was taken from the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>And on the right hand of the &s;aid north aile, at going into the gallilee, under the belfrey, called the galli|lee &s;teeple, was St Saviour's altar.</P>
<P>In the we&s;t end of the church, and of the north aile over the gallilee door, is a belfrey, called the gallilee &s;teeple, wherein hung four great bells, which were never rung but at principal fea&s;ts, or when the bi&s;hop came to town.</P>
<P>Every Sunday a &s;ermon was preached in the gallilee, from one to three in the afternoon; previous to which, at twelve, the great bell of the gallilee tolled three quarters of an hour, and rung the fourth quarter. There were certain officers of the &s;aid hou&s;e, who were always charged, whenever the bells were to be tolled, to be in readine&s;s to ring them: But after the hou&s;e was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the bells were never rung. In queen Elizabeth's reign dean Whittingham intended to have them taken down and broken; when Thomas Spark, the bi&s;hop's &s;uffragan, having notice of the dean's purpo&s;e, &s;ent directly into York&s;hire for a workman, and cau&s;ed three of the bells to be taken down, and hung up in the new work, called the lanthern, where he made a &s;et of chimes, which co&s;t him thirty or forty pounds.</P>
<P>The lowe&s;t window towards the lanthern had three lights divided with &s;tone work. The picture of Chri&s;t crucified was in the middle of the fir&s;t light; and in the &s;econd was the picture of our ble&s;&s;ed Lady; on the other &s;ide that of St John the Evangeli&s;t: On one &s;ide of Chri&s;t was a monk in a blue habit, kneeling and holding up his hands. And above were &s;ix turret windows in plain gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;econd window had two long lights divided with &s;tone work, and in white gla&s;s, with coloured gla&s;s about it.</P>
<P>In the third were two long lights, divided with &s;tone work, having in the fir&s;t light the picture of St Cathe|rine, and underneath her St O&s;wald, and below, that of St Cuthbert. In the &s;econd light was pictured the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, with Chri&s;t in her arms, and underneath St Bede, and below him St O&s;mond, bi&s;hop, and the arms of St Cuthbert and St O&s;wald; and four turret windows without pictures, in coloured gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The fourth window was plain, and as the &s;econd, with coloured gla&s;s about it.</P>
<P>In the fifth window were two long lights, divided as afore&s;aid, in white gla&s;s without pictures, but having round about coloured gla&s;s; and five turret windows; fir&s;t four, and one at the top.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth window had two long lights, with a &s;tone work partition: In the fir&s;t light was the picture of St O&s;wald, and under him St Paul; and in the &s;econd light was that of St Peter, and underneath him St James, in fine coloured gla&s;s: And above four turret lights, with bi&s;hop Skirlaw's arms on the top.</P>
<P>Within the church were two marble holy water &s;tones, bo&s;&s;ed with hollow bo&s;&s;es, on the out&s;ides thereof curiou&s;ly wrought: That at the north door was twice as capacious as the other at the &s;outh, both of the &s;ame workman&s;hip. The&s;e were taken away by dean Whittingham, and removed into his kitchen, and employed to prophane u&s;es. They &s;tood there during his life: his &s;ervants &s;teeped their beef and &s;alt fi&s;h in them, there being a conveyance in the bottoms to let out the water, as they had when in the church. After that dean's death the greater was removed to the lower end of the dean's buttery, where the water conduit is, and next unto the wine cellar, for the &s;ervants to wa&s;h their pots and cups in, before they &s;erved them at table. The ba&s;e of the great holy water &s;tone was laid without the north church door, and afterwards placed in the earth, in the &s;hop of one Lamb a black-&s;mith, upon Framwellgate bridge.&mdash;Con. from Davies, Sir John Law&s;on's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll.</P></NOTE>.

to this aile, but all the old painted gla&s;s is de&s;troyed. The vaultings of the &s;ide ailes are &s;emi-circular, and cro&s;&s;ed with groined arches in plain rolls, inter&s;ecting each other in the center. The middle aile of the nave is &s;ixty-nine and a half feet in height; the roof was vaulted with &s;tone about the year 1242, by prior Mel&s;onby; the ribs inter&s;ect each other in pointed arches, ornamented with zig-zag workin the fillets: There are &s;even upper windows to the north, and &s;ix to the &s;outh. At the ea&s;t end of the nave, between the pillars which &s;upport the great tower, anciently &s;tood Je&s;us's altar, with all its decorations, no traces of which remain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the body of the church, between two of the highe&s;t pillars &s;upporting the we&s;t &s;ide of the lanthern, oppo&s;ite to the choir door, was Je&s;us' altar, where ma&s;s was &s;ung every Friday in the year; and on the back|&s;ide was a high &s;tone wall, at each end whereof was a door, and called the two rood doors, for the proce&s;&s;ion to go forth and return at: Each end of the altar was clo&s;ed up with fine wain&s;cot, like to a porch, adjoining to each rood door, finely varni&s;hed with red varni&s;h. In the wain&s;cot, at the &s;outh end of the altar, were four grand almeries, to pre&s;erve the chalices and &s;ilver crewets, with two or three &s;uits of ve&s;tments, and other or|naments belonging to the &s;aid altar, for holy and principal days: And at the north end of the altar, in the wain&s;cot, was a door to come into the &s;aid porch. There was al&s;o &s;tanding on the altar, a mo&s;t curious fine table, with two leaves to open and &s;hut, comprehending the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord, richly &s;et in fine lively co|lours, all like burni&s;hed gold; which table was always locked up, but on principal days. Al&s;o the fore-part of the &s;aid porch, was a door with two broad leaves, to open from &s;ide to &s;ide, all of fine through-carved work: On the principal days, when any of the monks &s;aid ma&s;s at the &s;aid altar, the table was opened, and the door, which compo&s;ed the fore-part of the &s;aid porch, that every man might come in and &s;ee the table.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o in the height of the wall, from pillar to pillar, the whole &s;tory and pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord, wrought in &s;tone, and curiou&s;ly gilt: And above was the whole &s;tory and pictures of the twelve apo&s;tles, very artifically &s;et forth, and finely gilt, extending from one pillar to the other. And on the top above all, a border artificially wrought in &s;tone, with fine colours, and gilt, with branches and flowers. And likewi&s;e above the top of all, upon the wall, &s;tood the mo&s;t famous rood that was in all the land, with the picture of Mary on one &s;ide of our Saviour, and that of St John on the other, with two archangels.</P>
<P>Al&s;o on the back of the &s;aid rood, before the choir door, there was a loft, and the clock &s;tood in the &s;outh end thereof.</P>
<P>Every Friday, after evening prayer, an anthem was &s;ung in the body of the church, before St John's altar, called Je&s;us' anthem, which was performed by the ma&s;ter and choir, who &s;ung another anthem &s;itting on their knees before Je&s;us' altar, one of the gallilee bells tolling.&mdash;Davies, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>.

<P>Divers books of the life and miracles of St Cuthbert have been written, which &s;et forth, That St Cuthbert, for a long time, led a mo&s;t reclu&s;e life, in the borders of the Picts; in which time it happened that the daugh|ter of the king of that province was got with child by &s;ome young man in her father's hou&s;e. The king per|ceiving her pregnancy, diligently examined her who was the cau&s;e of that fact; whereupon &s;he made this an|&s;wer: That &s;olitary young man who dwelleth hard by, is he who hath overcome me, and by who&s;e beauty I am thus deceived. Whereupon the king repaired to the hermit's place, with his deflowered daughter, attended by divers knights, where he in&s;tantly acco&s;ted the &s;ervant of God in this manner: What art thou he, who, under the colour of religion, prophane&s;t the temple and &s;anctuary of God? Art thou he, who, under the cloak and profe&s;&s;ion of an hermit, exerci&s;e&s;t thy&s;elf in all filthine&s;s? Behold my daughter, whom thou by thy wile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ha&s;t corrupted, not fearing to de&s;tower her: Therefore now at la&s;t confe&s;s this thy fault, and plainly declare here, before this company in what &s;ort thou ha&s;t &s;educed her. The king's daughter marking the fierce &s;peeches of her father, very impudently &s;tepped forth, and boldly affirmed, that it was he who had done that wicked fact: At which the young man, greatly amazed, perceiving that this calumny proceeded from the in|&s;tigation of the Devil, applied his whole heart unto Almighty God, &s;aying: My Lord, my God, who only knowe&s;t, and art the di&s;coverer of all &s;ecrets, make manife&s;t al&s;o this work of iniquity, and by &s;ome token di&s;|prove the &s;ame, which, though it cannot be done by human policy, make it known by &s;ome divine token. When the young man had &s;poken the&s;e words, &s;uddenly, and in the &s;ame place where the &s;tood, the earth making a hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, pre&s;ently opened, and &s;wallowed her up in the pre&s;ence of all the &s;pectators. This place is called Corwen, where &s;he for her corruption was conveyed down into Hell. As &s;oon as the king per|ceived this miracle, he began to be greatly tormented in his mind, fearing le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for his furious threats he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m the &s;ame puni&s;hment. Whereupon he, with his company, humbly craving pardon of Almighty God, with a further petition to that good man St Cuthbert, that by his prayers he would crave of God to have his daughter again: Which petition the holy father granted, upon condition, that from thence no woman &s;hould come near him. Whence it came to pa&s;s that the king did not &s;uffer any woman to enter into any church dedicated to that &s;aint. Davies, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The ORGANS.</HEAD>
<P>There were three pair of organs belonging to the &s;aid choir, for maintenance of God's &s;ervice, and the bet|ter celebrating thereof. The grande&s;t of the three &s;tood over the choir door, only opened and played upon on principal fea&s;ts, the pipes being all of the fine&s;t wood and workman&s;hip, partly gilt upon the in&s;ide, and the out&s;ide of the leaves and cover up to the top, with branches and flowers, finely gilt, with the name of Je&s;us gilt with gold. There were but two pair more of them in England of the &s;ame make; one pair in York, and another in St Paul's.</P>
<P>Al&s;o there was a lettern of wood, like unto a pulpit, &s;tanding and adjoining to the wood organs, over the choir door, where they u&s;ed to &s;ing the nine le&s;&s;ons in the old time on principal days, &s;tanding with their faces towards the high altar.</P>
<P>The &s;econd pair &s;tood on the north &s;ide of the choir, being never played upon, but when the four doctors of the church were read, viz. Augu&s;tine, Ambro&s;e, Gregory, and Jerome, being a pair of fair large organs, called the cryers.</P>

<P>In the lanthern, called the new work, hung three fine bells, rung always at twelve o'clock at night; the monks going to mattins at that hour; four men were appointed to ring the&s;e bells at midnight, and at &s;uch times of the day as the monks went to &s;erve God; two of the &s;aid men belonged to the reve&s;try, and kept the copes, the ve&s;tments, and five pair of &s;ilver cen&s;ers, with the other ornaments pertaining to the high altar, and lay in the chamber over the we&s;t end of the reve&s;try: The other two men lay in a chamber in the north aile, over again&s;t the &s;acri&s;t's exchequer; they &s;wept and kept the church clean, and filled the holy water &s;tones every Sunday morning, and locked the church doors every night.</P>
<P>The &s;teeple of this cathedral, a &s;tately fabric, is remarkable as well for its height as &s;trength and ju&s;t archi|tecture, having on the in&s;ide a gallery of &s;tone work around it, above the turn of the arches of the pillars upon which it is founded; above which are eight long windows, two on each front of the &s;teeple, divided in the middle by a cro&s;s bar of &s;tone, and hand&s;omely glazed with plain gla&s;s. Above the windows, on the out&s;ide, is another gallery, and above that a &s;uper&s;tructure, having two windows on each front, wherein hang eight melodious bells. In the eight buttre&s;&s;es, on the &s;ides of the lower windows, al&s;o in the &s;tone work betwixt each window, are niches, containing the &s;tatues of the founders, protectors, and benefactors.&mdash;Davies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As I noted before, the&s;e eight bells were ca&s;t in 1632, from the metal of the gallilee bells, and tho&s;e of the lanthern, and co&s;t 128l. 12s. 7d. and were reca&s;t in 1693.</P>

<HEAD>The CHOIR.</HEAD>
<P>In the ea&s;t end of the choir, joining upon St Cuthbert's feretory, &s;tood the high altar, with many precious and co&s;tly ornaments appertaining to it, as well for every principal day, as for every of our Lady's days. Be|twixt the &s;aid high altar and St Cuthbert's feretory, was all of French Pierre, curiou&s;ly wrought both on the out&s;ide and the in&s;ide, with images of alaba&s;ter, and gilt; being called in the ancient hi&s;tory Lardo&s;e. The &s;aid French Pierre or Lardo&s;e, reaching in height almo&s;t to the middle vault, and containing the breadth of the choir in length. In the mid&s;t whereof, right over the high altar, were placed, in very fine alaba&s;ter, the picture of our Lady &s;tanding in the mid&s;t, and the picture of St Cuthbert on one &s;ide, and of St O&s;wald on the other, all richly gilt. And at either end of this altar was a wand of iron fa&s;tened in the wall, whereon hung curtains or hangings of white &s;ilk daily. The daily ornaments that were hung both before the altar and above, were of red velvet, with flowers of gold, in embroidered work, and many pictures be&s;ides very finely gilt: But the ornaments for the principal fea&s;t, the a&s;&s;umption of our Lady, were all of white dama&s;k, be&s;et with pearls and precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>Within the &s;aid choir, over the high altar, hung a rich and mo&s;t &s;umptuous canopy, for the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acra|ment, which had two irons fa&s;tened in the French Pierre, finely gilt; which held the canopy over the mid&s;t of the &s;aid high altar, that it could not move or &s;tir; whereon &s;tood a pelican of &s;ilver, upon the height of the &s;aid canopy, very finely gilt, giving her blood to her young ones. And the pix was of pure gold, curiou&s;ly wrought; and the white cloth that hung over the pix was of very fine lawn, embroidered and wrought with gold and red &s;ilk; and four great round knobs of gold curiou&s;ly wrought, with ta&s;&s;els of gold and red &s;ilk hung at them, and the four corners of the white lawn cloth; and the crook that hung within the cloth, that the pix hung upon, was of gold; and the cord that drew it up and down was made of fine &s;trong white &s;ilk. And when the monks went to high ma&s;s, they put on their ve&s;tments in the reve&s;try, both the epi&s;tler and go&s;peller; And when the office of the ma&s;s began to be &s;ung, the epi&s;tler came forth out of the reve&s;try, the other two monks following him, at the &s;outh choir door, and there &s;tood till the Gloria Patri or the office of the ma&s;s began to be &s;ung; and then with great reverence and devotion, they went all up to the altar; and one of the vergers that kept the reve&s;try went before them, with a large tip-&s;taff in his hand. The go&s;peller carried a fair book, which had the epi&s;tles and go&s;pels in it, and laid it on the altar; which book had on the out&s;ide of the covering, the picture of our Saviour, of &s;ilver, of gold&s;mith's work, parcel-gilt; which book did &s;erve for the pix in the ma&s;s. The epi&s;tler, when he had &s;ung the epi&s;tle, laid the book again upon the altar; and afterwards when the go&s;pel was &s;ung, the go&s;peller did lay it down upon the altar likewi&s;e, until the ma&s;s was done.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="252">Al&s;o there was pertaining to the high altar two chalices, one was of gold, the other of &s;ilver, double gilt, and the foot of it &s;et full of precious &s;tones; that of gold was for principal days, and the other was to &s;erve every day: Likewi&s;e there was pertaining to the &s;aid high altar, two great ba&s;ons of &s;ilver, one for principal days, double gilt; and the other for every day, not &s;o large, being parcel-gilt, and engraven all over; and two great crewets of &s;ilver, containing a quart a-piece, parcel-gilt, and engraven all over; and two le&s;&s;er crewets for every day, all of &s;ilver; one pair of &s;ilver cen&s;ers for every day, and two pair of &s;ilver cen&s;ers for every double fea&s;t, double gilt; and two pair of &s;ilver cen&s;ers, parcel-gilt, and the chains al&s;o for every principal day; and with two &s;hips of &s;ilver, parcel-gilt, for principal days; and other two of &s;ilver, ungilt, for every day, to carry frankincen&s;e in; and two &s;ilver candle&s;ticks, double gilt, for two tapers, very finely wrought, of three quarters height, to be taken in &s;under with wre&s;ts; and the other two &s;ilver candle&s;ticks, for every day's &s;ervice, parcel-gilt; with &s;umptuous furniture for every fe&s;tival day, of changeable &s;uits. Divers of the ve&s;tments were &s;et round about with pearls, both &s;toles and &s;tannels. There were al&s;o other very rich jewels and ornaments per|taining to the &s;aid high altar.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o two cro&s;&s;es to be borne on principal days for proce&s;&s;ion; one for gold, and the &s;taff it &s;tood in was of &s;ilver, of gold&s;mith's work, very curiou&s;ly wrought, and double gilt. The other cro&s;s was of &s;ilver, double gilt, and the &s;taff was of wood, of the &s;ame workman&s;hip, and double gilt. Al&s;o there was another cro&s;s of cry&s;tal that &s;erved for every day in the week. There was borne before the cro&s;s every principal day, a holy water font, of &s;ilver, very finely engraved, and parcel-gilt, which one of the novices carried.</P>
<P>In the north &s;ide of the choir there is an almery nigh to the high altar, fa&s;tened in the wall, to lay any thing in, pertaining to the high altar.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another almery in the &s;outh &s;ide of the choir, nigh the high altar, inclo&s;ed in the wall, to &s;et the chalices, ba&s;ons, and the crewets in.</P>
<P>At the north end of the high altar there was a very fine lettern of bra&s;s, where they &s;ung the epi&s;tle and the go&s;pel, with a great pelican on the height of it, finely gilt, billing the blood out of her brea&s;t to feed her young ones, and her wings &s;pread abroad, whereon lay the book, in which they &s;ung the epi&s;tle and go&s;pel; it was thought to be the fine&s;t lettern of bra&s;s in this country. It was all to be taken a&s;under with wre&s;ts, every joint from the other.</P>
<P>Al&s;o there was lower down in the choir another lettern of bra&s;s, not &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought, &s;tanding in the mid&s;t again&s;t the &s;talls, a very beautiful one, with an eagle on the height of it, and her wings-&s;pread abroad, whereon the monks laid their books when they &s;ung their legends, at mattins, or other times of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Before the high altar were three fine &s;ilver ba&s;ons hanging in chains of &s;ilver, one on the &s;outh &s;ide of the choir, above the &s;teps going up to the high altar; the &s;econd on the north &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to the fir&s;t; the third in the mid&s;t between them both, ju&s;t before the high altar. The&s;e three &s;ilver ba&s;ons had latten ba&s;ons within them, having pricks for &s;erges or great waxen candles to &s;tand on; the latten ba&s;ons being to receive the drops of the three candles, which burned day and night.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o another &s;ilver ba&s;on hanging in &s;ilver chains before the &s;acrament of the afore&s;aid high altar, but nearer to the &s;aid altars than the others, hanging almo&s;t over the prie&s;t's back, which was only lighted in time of ma&s;s, and that ended, extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Al&s;o there was a hand&s;ome monument belonging to the church, called the pa&s;chal, which u&s;ed to be &s;et up in the choir, and there to remain from the Thur&s;day, called Maunday Thur&s;day before Ea&s;ter, till the Wed|ne&s;day after A&s;cen&s;ion-day. It &s;tood upon a four-&s;quare thick plank of wood, again&s;t the fir&s;t grees or &s;tep, behind the three ba&s;ons of &s;ilver that hung before the high altar: At every corner of the &s;aid plank was an iron ring, whereunto the feet of the pa&s;chal were adjoined, repre&s;enting the pictures of the four flying dragons; as al&s;o the pictures of the four evangeli&s;ts, above the top of the dragons, underneath the nethermo&s;t bo&s;s, all &s;upporting the whole pa&s;chal; and the four quarters have been four chry&s;tal &s;tones, as appear by the holes: And on every &s;ide of the four dragons there is a curious antique work, as bea&s;ts, men upon hor&s;eback, with bucklers, bows, and &s;hafts, and knots, with broad leaves &s;pread upon the knots, very finely wrought, all being of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t curious candle&s;tick metal, or latten metal, having &s;ix candle&s;ticks or flowers of can|dle&s;tick metal coming from it, three on either &s;ide, whereon &s;tood a taper of wax: And on the height of the &s;aid candle&s;tick was a large pretty flower, being the principal flower, which was the &s;eventh candle&s;tick. The pa&s;chal in latitude contained almo&s;t the breadth of the choir, in longitude it extended to the height of the lower vault, whereon &s;tood a long piece of wood reaching within a man's length to the uppermo&s;t vault or roof of the church, upon which &s;tood a great, long &s;quared taper of wax, called the pa&s;chal; having a fine convenience through the &s;aid roof of the church to light the taper. The pa&s;chal was e&s;teemed to be one of the rare&s;t monuments in England.</P>

<HEAD>The PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>Within the church of Durham, upon Good Friday, there was a mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;ervice; in which two of the elde&s;t monks took a large beautiful crucifix, all of gold, laying it upon a velvet cu&s;hion, having St Cuthbert's
<PB N="241" REF="253">arms upon it, embroidered with gold, bringing it betwixt them upon the &s;aid cu&s;hion, to the lowe&s;t &s;teps in the choir, and there betwixt them, held the &s;aid picture of our Saviour, &s;itting on either &s;ide of it. And there one of the &s;aid monks ro&s;e and went a pretty &s;pace from it, &s;itting down upon his knees, with his &s;hoes put off, crept upon his knees unto the &s;aid cro&s;s, and ki&s;t it; and after him the other monk did &s;o likewi&s;e; and they &s;at down on either &s;ide of the &s;aid cro&s;s&punc; holding it betwixt them; after that the prior came out of his &s;tall, and &s;at down upon his knees with his &s;hoes off: And in like manner crept unto the &s;aid cro&s;s, and all the monks after him, one after another in the &s;ame order; in the mean time the whole choir &s;inging a hymn. The &s;ervice being ended, the &s;aid two monks carried the cro&s;s to the &s;epulchre with great reverence; (which was &s;et up that morning on the north &s;ide of the choir, nigh unto the high altar, before the &s;ervice time) and there laid it in the &s;aid &s;epulchre with great devotion, with another picture of our Saviour Chri&s;t, in who&s;e brea&s;t they inclo&s;ed, with great reverence, the mo&s;t holy and ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament of the altar; &s;etting two tapers lighted before it, which burned till Ea&s;ter day in the morning that it was taken forth.</P>

<HEAD>The RESURRECTION.</HEAD>
<P>There was in the church of Durham very &s;olemn &s;ervice upon Ea&s;ter day, between three and four o'clock in the morning, in honour of the re&s;urrection, where two of the elde&s;t monks of the choir came to the &s;epul|chre &s;et up on Good Friday, covered with red velvet, and embroidered with gold, and then cen&s;ed it, each monk with a pair of &s;ilver cen&s;ers, &s;itting on their knees before the &s;epulchre. Then they both ri&s;ing came to the &s;epulchre, out of which, with great reverence, they took a beautiful image of our Saviour, repre&s;enting the re&s;urrection, with a cro&s;s in his hand, in the brea&s;t whereof was inclo&s;ed in cry&s;tal, the holy &s;acrament of the altar; through which cry&s;tal the ble&s;&s;ed ho&s;t was con&s;picuous to the beholders. Then after the elevation of the &s;aid picture, carried by the &s;aid two monks upon a velvet cu&s;hion embroidered, &s;inging the anthem of <HI>Chri&s;tus Re&s;urgens,</HI> they brought it to the high altar, &s;etting it on the mid&s;t thereof, the two monks kneeling before the altar, and cen&s;ing it all the time that the re&s;t of the choir were &s;inging the afore&s;aid anthem of <HI>Chri&s;tus Re&s;urgens;</HI> which anthem being ended, the two monks took up the cu&s;hion and the picture from the altar, &s;upporting it betwixt them, and proceeding in proce&s;&s;ion from the high altar to the &s;outh choir door, where there were four ancient gentlemen, belonging to the prior, appointed to attend their coming, holding up a very rich canopy of purple velvet, ta&s;sled round about with red &s;ilk, and a gold fringe, and at every cor|ner of the canopy &s;tood one of the ancient gentlemen to bear it over the &s;aid image, with the holy &s;acrament carried by the two monks round about the church, the whole choir waiting upon it with torches and a great number of other lights, all &s;inging, rejoicing, and praying to God mo&s;t devoutly, till they returned to the high altar, whereon they placed the &s;aid image, there to remain till A&s;cen&s;ion day.</P>
<P>Ludovicus de Bello Monte, bi&s;hop of Durham, lies buried before the high altar in the choir, under a mo&s;t curious and &s;umptuous marble &s;tone, which he prepared for him&s;elf before he died; being adorned with mo&s;t excellent workman&s;hip of bra&s;s, whereon he was mo&s;t excellently and lively pictured, as he was accu&s;tomed to &s;ing or &s;ay ma&s;s, with his mitre on his head, and his cro&s;ier &s;taff in his hand, with two angels finely pictur|ed, one on the one &s;ide of his head, and the other on the other &s;ide, with cen&s;ers in their hands cen&s;ing him; and containing al&s;o pictures and image of the twelve apo&s;tles, divided and bordered on either &s;ide of him; and next them are bordered on each &s;ide of the twelve apo&s;tles, in another border, the pictures of his ance&s;tors, in their coats of arms, being of the blood royal of France; he had a white lion placed upon the brea&s;t of his ve&s;tment, underneath the ver&s;es of his brea&s;t, with flower-de-luces about the lion; and two lions pictured, one under one foot of him, and the other under his other foot, &s;upporting and holding up his cro&s;ier &s;taff, his feet adjoining and &s;tanding upon the &s;aid lions; and two other lions beneath them, in the nethermo&s;t border of all, being very artificially wrought in bra&s;s.</P>

<P>There was always &s;ix novices, who went daily to &s;chool within the hou&s;e, for the &s;pace of &s;even years toge|ther, and one of the elde&s;t and mo&s;t learned monks was their tutor. The &s;aid novices had no wages, but meat, drink, and apparel, for that &s;pace. The ma&s;ter, or tutor's office was to &s;ee they wanted nothing; as cowls, frocks, &s;tamyne, bedding, boots, &s;ocks; and as &s;oon as they needed any of the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, the ma&s;ter had charge to call at the chamberlain's for &s;uch things. They never received wages, nor handled money in that time, but went daily to their books in the cloy&s;ter: And if the ma&s;ter found any of them more apt to learn, and diligently pro&s;ecuting his &s;tudies, then he gave notice thereof to the prior, and he was &s;oon &s;ent to Oxford, there to learn and &s;tudy divinity, and the re&s;t of the novices were kept at their books, till they could under&s;tand their &s;ervice and the &s;criptures. At &s;even years of age they &s;ung their fir&s;t ma&s;s, and from thence the hou&s;e was no longer charged with finding them apparel; for then they entered into wages, to find them|&s;elves with apparel, which was twenty &s;hillings a-year each, and had no more to &s;upply them&s;elves withal.&mdash; The elde&s;t monk in the hou&s;e had no more, except he had an office. His chamber was in the dorter.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="254">Dr John Porter, alias Smith, &s;acri&s;tan.</P>
<P>The &s;acri&s;t's exchequer was within the church, in the north alley, oppo&s;ite to bi&s;hop Skirlaw's altar, on the left hand as you go up to the abbey of St Cuthbert's feretory.</P>
<P>His office was to provide bread and wine for the church, and wax and lights in winter. He had always a tun of wine lying in his exchequer, for the u&s;e of the church. He had al&s;o &s;acri&s;tan-heugh in his keeping; it was his charge; and St Mary's cupboard was his office. He was al&s;o to &s;ee the gla&s;s windows repaired, and the plummer's work of the church done; and mending of bells and bell-ropes, and all other works nece&s;&s;ary to be performed, both within and without the church, and to &s;ee the church kept clean.</P>
<P>His office was al&s;o to lock up every night the keys of every altar in the church, every altar having its &s;eve|ral almery, and &s;ome two, to lay the &s;aid keys forth every morning between &s;even and eight o'clock, upon the top of the almery, which was of wain&s;cot, wherein they were locked, which &s;tood within the north choir door, that every monk might take the key, and go to what altar he was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay ma&s;s at.</P>
<P>They al&s;o went to the chapter-hou&s;e every day between eight and nine o'clock, where all the bi&s;hops in the old time were buried, and there prayed for all their benefactors, and tho&s;e who had be&s;towed any thing upon this church. At nine o'clock a bell was rung to ma&s;s, called the chapter ma&s;s, which was always &s;ung at the high altar; and he that &s;ung the ma&s;s had always in his memento, all tho&s;e who had given any thing to this church. One half of the monks &s;aid ma&s;s in the chapter ma&s;s time, and the other half that &s;ung not the chap|ter ma&s;s, &s;aid ma&s;s in the high ma&s;s time.</P>
<P>There were at every altar two chalices, and two &s;ilver crewets appertaining to it, both with albs and ve&s;t|ments for principal fea&s;ts; as al&s;o for all other days be&s;ide. Every altar had its double furniture for adorning all parts of the altar, &s;erving both for holidays and principal fea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Their founders and benefactors were prayed for every day, and had in remembrance in the time of &s;aying ma&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;acri&s;tan's chamber was in the dorter, and he had his meat &s;erved from the great kitchen to his exchequer.</P>
<P>Other officers of the church.</P>
<P>Dr Robert Bennet, bowcer of the hou&s;e: He was the fir&s;t prebendary in the eleventh &s;tall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>His exchequer was a little &s;tone hou&s;e joining upon the coal-garth pertaining to the great kitchen, a little di&s;tant from the dean's hall &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Dr Roger Wright, cellerer of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His exchequer was afterwards Dr Tod's chamber, joining to the we&s;t end of the great kitchen, having a pair of &s;tairs going up to it, and was the fir&s;t prebendary in the eleventh &s;tall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>Dr Roger Wat&s;on, terrer of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His exchequer was as you go into the gue&s;t-hall, on the left hand in the entry at going into the great hall.</P>
<P>Dr William For&s;ter, keeper of the garners.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the garners exchequer was over Mr Pilkington's hall door, all who&s;e hou&s;e, and Mr Bun|ney's, were garners, where their wheat and other corn lay.</P>
<P>The&s;e granaries are at pre&s;ent the hou&s;es of the &s;eventh and eighth prebendaries.</P>
<P>The kiln was where Mr Robert Bennet's lodging was, beyond the conduit. This lodging was built at his own expence. It is at this time the hou&s;e of the eleventh prebendary.</P>
<P>Dr Thomas Spark, chamberlain, the fir&s;t prebendary in the third &s;tall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>His exchequer was near the abbey-gates; now the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of the fir&s;t prebendary.</P>
<P>The chamberlain's office was to provide &s;tamyne, otherwi&s;e called lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey, for &s;heets and &s;hirts for the novices and the monks, for they were not permitted to wear linen. He kept a taylor daily at work, in making &s;ocks of white woollen cloth, both whole and half &s;ocks; and making &s;hirts and &s;heets of lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey, in a &s;hop underneath the exchequer. This taylor was one of the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e. The cham|ber where he lay was in the dorter.</P>
<P>Dr Henry Brown, ma&s;ter of the common-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His office was to provide all &s;uch &s;pices again&s;t Lent as &s;hould be comfortable to the monks, under their great au&s;terity, both of fa&s;ting and praying; and to have a fire con&s;tantly in the common-hou&s;e hall, for the monks to warm them&s;elves at when they plea&s;ed; and to provide always a hog&s;head of wine for the monks; and for keeping his O, called O Sapientia, and to provide &s;igs and walnuts for Lent. His chamber was in the dorter.</P>
<P>Dr William Wat&s;on, the prior's chaplain.</P>
<P>His exchequer was over the &s;tairs in going up to the dean's hall. He was the fir&s;t prebendary in the twelfth &s;tall. Anno 1542.</P>
<P>His office was to receive at the bowcer's hands, all &s;uch &s;ums of money as were payable by him to the lord prior's u&s;e for his maintenance, the expence of his whole hou&s;hold, and his other nece&s;&s;aries. The &s;aid chap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia was to provide apparel for the lord prior, and to &s;ee all things in good order in the hall, and the furniture
<PB N="243" REF="255">for his table to be &s;weet and clean; and that every man executed his office diligently as he ought to do; and that no debate or &s;trife &s;hould be within the hou&s;e. He had in his cu&s;tody all the lord prior's plate and trea|&s;ure, as well for delivering it out, as receiving it again. He was al&s;o to di&s;charge and pay all the gentlemen, yeomen, and all other the &s;ervants and officers of the lord prior's hou&s;e their wages, and to di&s;charge all other debts of the hou&s;e what&s;oever. His chamber was adjoining to the prior's chamber.</P>

<P>The ancient cu&s;tom of proce&s;&s;ion in the abbey church of Durham, on certain fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>Upon St Mark's day.</P>
<P>St Mark's day was commonly kept a fa&s;t through all the country, and no fle&s;h eaten upon it: The prior with the monks made a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, and went to Bow church, doing very &s;olemn &s;ervice there; and one of the monks made a &s;ermon to the pari&s;hioners and town's men who came thither.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion on the three cro&s;s days, by the prior and monks.</P>
<P>On Monday in cro&s;s-week they had another &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, going to St O&s;wald's church in Elvet, and there did a &s;olemn &s;ervice: A &s;ermon was preached by one of the monks, before a numerous audience.&mdash; Tue&s;day, the day following, in another &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, they went to St Margaret's church, in Cro&s;gate, with &s;olemn &s;ervice, and a &s;ermon. On Wedne&s;day, the next day, they had the like proce&s;&s;ion to St Nicho|las' church, there doing divine &s;ervice very &s;olemnly, and a &s;ermon was preached before a great audience.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion on Holy-Thur&s;day, Whit-Sunday, and Trinity-Sunday, by the prior and the monks.</P>
<P>The next morning, being Holy-Thur&s;day, they had a general proce&s;&s;ion, with two cro&s;&s;es borne before them; one, both cro&s;s and &s;taff, all of gold; the other of &s;ilver parcel-gilt, with that holy relique St Cuthbert's banner, being carried fir&s;t in the proce&s;&s;ion, with all the rich copes belonging to the church, every monk one. The prior had an exceedingly rich one of cloth of gold, which was &s;o ma&s;&s;y that he could not go upright with it, unle&s;s his gentlemen, who at other times bore up his train, &s;upported it on every &s;ide whenever he had it on. He had his cro&s;ier &s;taff in his hand, which was of &s;ilver double guilt, and a rich mitre on his head: Al&s;o that holy relique St Bede's &s;hrine, was carried in the proce&s;&s;ion by four monks, upon their &s;houlders. And other monks carried about with them in the &s;aid proce&s;&s;ion, &s;everal holy reliques, as the picture of St O&s;wald, of &s;ilver gilt, and St Margaret's cro&s;s, of &s;ilver double gilt. The proce&s;&s;ion came out at the north door of the abbey church and through the church-yard, and down Lidgate, by Bow church end, and up the South Bailey, and in at the abbey gates, where a great number of people &s;tood, and &s;o proceeded through the abbey garth, whither no woman was permitted to go; and &s;o through the cloi&s;ters into the church.</P>
<P>Upon Whit-Sunday was a general proce&s;&s;ion, with the &s;ame &s;olemnities as had been ob&s;erved on Holy-Thur&s;day, with St Bede's &s;hrine, St Cuthbert's banner, and all the holy reliques; as the image of St O&s;wald, and the image of St Aidanus, and St Margaret's cro&s;s, and divers others.</P>
<P>On Trinity-Sunday was another general proce&s;&s;ion as afore&s;aid, with all the above recited reliques, going the &s;ame circuit.</P>

Advancing towards the altar, where the &s;talls terminate, the pavement is elevated one &s;tep, and on the right-hand is the bi&s;hop's throne, erected by bi&s;hop Hatfield, over the vault prepared for his own monument, and built in a &s;tile con|&s;i&s;tent with the proud idea he held of the dignity of his mitre. Mr Pennant &s;peak|ing of it, &s;ays, <Q>In the choir is the bi&s;hop's throne, elevated to an uncommon height, erected in times of the triumph of &s;uper&s;tition. A painful a&s;cent to the pre&s;ent prelate, who&s;e wi&s;h is directed more to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by benevolence and &s;incerity, than any exterior trappings or badges of dignity.</Q> The a&s;cent to the throne is by many &s;teps; in the center is a chair of &s;tate, richly ornamented, and canopied over head with tabernacle work, coloured and gilt; on each &s;ide, the throne is lined with tape&s;try, and otherwi&s;e hand&s;omely furni&s;hed, large enough to receive the chief temporal officers, with the &s;ervants who are about the prelate's per&s;on: The bi&s;hop, when he goes to his throne, is always preceded by a per&s;on

The images are all removed. Below the throne are &s;talls for the prebendaries' ladies: On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the choir, where bi&s;hop Skirlaw's tomb was, are other &s;talls for the ladies of the bi&s;hops, and dean's families and others; and clo&s;e adjoining is the pulpit, finely ornamented with inlaid figures in the Italian &s;tile, repre&s;enting &s;ome of the apo&s;tles, the ground Swedi&s;h oak; the figures are almo&s;t as large as life, &s;o artfully &s;hadowed as to appear like a delicate painting in bronze: The &s;ounding board is &s;upported by one column. The opening into the &s;ide ailes to which you de&s;cend by five marble &s;teps, is by a gate, and two &s;ide lights of open tracery work, in wood, finely executed and fini&s;hed above with tabernacle work. The choir com|prehends four pillars on each &s;ide, two of them clu&s;tered, and two round, the round ones cut in the &s;piral figure: The double gallery above the &s;ide ailes is formed of circular arches, each of the lower openings divided by a &s;ingle column. The roof was repaired, or rather new vaulted by prior Hotoun, who acceded in 1289; it is of elegant Gothic work, the ribs of the arches terminating in points ornamented with ro&s;es, the fillets pierced in ro&s;es and cro&s;&s;es: Some of the decorations of the center ro&s;es are &s;ingular; one next to the organ contains a human figure, with three round balls in an apron, not unu&s;ual among the heathen emblematical effigies. From the altar rails ea&s;tward, the whole work appears nearly of the &s;ame date, and by the ar|chitecture of this part of the edifice, we are led to conclude that the building origi|nally terminated here, and was opened further ea&s;tward to form a connection with the ea&s;t tran&s;ept: The columns which ri&s;e at the altar rail, are little more than the plain facing of a common wall, ornamented with long &s;mall round pila&s;ters, &s;ingle and belted in the middle, their capitals pierced, decorated with figures of animals, and fini&s;hed above with tabernacle work; the whole appearing like ornaments placed occa&s;ionally there: The opening of the gallery in this part is different from the re&s;t of the church, con&s;i&s;ting of three pointed arches, &s;upported by columns who&s;e capitals are richly pierced, and the fillets of the arches are pierced and highly decorated; there is al&s;o an interior pillar &s;upporting a groined vaulting. Here the building appears to have been broken off and the ea&s;t wall removed. The vaulting of the roof is continued, and over the altar table fini&s;hes with a fine pointed arch, &s;upported on clu&s;tered pillars, ranging with the &s;ide of the ea&s;t tran|&s;ept; the capitals and the fillets or mouldings of the arch are highly fini&s;hed with pierced work, and bear no degree of &s;imilitude to any of the more we&s;tern parts of this edifice. Within the altar rails ea&s;tward, from the plain columns before de&s;|cribed, are four &s;eats on each &s;ide of the altar table, for the officiating prie&s;ts to re&s;t, formed of pillars, &s;upporting pinnacle work, of the &s;ame materials and de&s;ign as the work behind the altar, and mo&s;t probably erected at the &s;ame time: The&s;e &s;eats are clo&s;ed from the ailes behind with a wall, which proves the occa&s;ionality, by

<P>Into this &s;umptuous new church was the la&s;t and great tran&s;lation of St Cuthbert, but before the day came, prior Turgot, with &s;ome of his brethren, determined to open his tombe with intent to &s;hew his body to the people, if they found it entire: Att night, therefore, they mett at his &s;epulchre, and reverently taking off the &s;tone, they found a che&s;t well fortified with nayles and leather, and in it another wrapt in cloth thrice double, in which they found the booke of the evangeli&s;ts which had fallen into the &s;ea, a little &s;ilver altar, a goblet of pure gold, with an Onyx &s;tone, and an ivory comb: La&s;tly, opening the third che&s;t, they found the body of the &s;aint (which the grave in &s;o many years had not dige&s;ted) lying upon the right &s;ide to give room to the re&s;t of the reliques: For in the &s;ame coffyn were the bones of Venerable Beda, the head of St O&s;wald, part of the bones of Aidanus, Eadfrid, and Ethelwold, bi&s;hops of Lindisfarne: All which reliques they placed with due reverence in other parts of the church; and laying St Cuthbert on his back, they placed St O&s;wald's head be|tween his bands. At the day of his tran&s;lation, Ranulphus, the bi&s;hop, publi&s;hed in his &s;ermon to the people, the incorruption of St Cuthbert's body, which, after four years was flexible, and now might plead pre&s;crip|tion with the grave to be immortale. And thus in great &s;olemnity they in&s;hrined him beneath the high altar in the pre&s;ence of the abbot of St Albans, the abbot of St Maries, in Yorke, the abbot of St Germans, prior Turgot, with thou&s;ands of people &s;pectators of the miracle.

<P>Next to the nine altars was the monument of St Cuthbert, having the high altar on the we&s;t, in the mid&s;t whereof his &s;hrine was exalted with mo&s;t curious workman&s;hip, of fine green marble, gilt with gold; having four &s;eats or places underneath the &s;hrine, for pilgrims or lame men, &s;itting on their knees to re&s;t on, in the time of their devout offerings. It was e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous monuments in all England, &s;o great were the offerings and jewels be&s;towed upon it.</P>
<P>At the we&s;t end of this &s;hrine was a little altar for ma&s;s to be &s;aid on, only upon the great and holy fea&s;t of St Cuthbert's day in Lent: At which &s;olemnity the prior and the whole convent did keep open hou&s;hold in the frater-hou&s;e, and dined all together, and on no day el&s;e in the year: And at this fea&s;t, and certain other fe&s;tival days, they were accu&s;tomed to draw up the cover of St Cuthbert's &s;hrine, being of wain&s;cot, having &s;ix very fine &s;ounding &s;ilver bells fa&s;tened to the rope; which, at the drawing up of the cover, made a goodly &s;ound; which &s;aid cover on the out&s;ide was very finely and artificially gilded. And on either &s;ide were painted four lively images; on the ea&s;t end the picture of our Saviour &s;itting on the rainbow to give judgment; on the we&s;t end was the picture of our Lady, and Chri&s;t on her knee; and on the height of the cover from end to end was a fine bratti&s;hing of carved work, cut throughout with dragons, fowls, and bea&s;ts; and the in&s;ide of the cover was all varni&s;hed and coloured with a fine &s;anguine colour; and at every corner of the cover there was a lock to lock it down.</P>
<P>Al&s;o within the &s;aid feretory, both on the north &s;ide and the &s;outh, there were almeries of wain&s;cot, varni&s;h|ed, finely painted, and gilt over with little images, for the reliques of St Cuthbert to lie in; and within the almeries did lie all the holy reliques that were offered to St Cuthbert; and when his &s;hrine was drawn, the almeries were opened, that every man might &s;ee the holy reliques therein, accounted the mo&s;t &s;umptuous
<PB N="247" REF="259">and riche&s;t jewels in all this land; for great were the gifts and godly devotion of kings, queens, and other e&s;tates, at that time, towards God and holy St Cuthbert in this church.</P>
<P>Within this feretory were many little pictures of &s;aints, of imagery work, all of alaba&s;ter, &s;et in the French Pierre in their &s;everal places, the pictures being curiou&s;ly engraved and gilt; and the Nevil's cro&s;s and bulls head &s;et upon the height; and on either &s;ide of the two doors in the French Pierre, and al&s;o in divers other places of the French Pierre be&s;ides; which feretory and French Pierre were made at the charges of John lord Nevil.</P>
<P>At the ea&s;t end of St Cuthbert's feretory were wrought upon the height of the irons towards the nine altars, very fine candle&s;ticks of iron, like unto &s;ockets, which had lights &s;et in them before day, that every monk might have light to &s;ee to read their books at the &s;aid nine altars, when they &s;aid ma&s;s; and al&s;o to give light to all others that came thither to divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The king of Scots' ancient and his banner, with divers other noblemen's ancients, were all brought to St Cuthbert's feretory; and there the &s;aid lord Nevil offered the jewels and banners; and there the &s;aid banners and ancients &s;tood and hung till the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e. The lord Nevil's banner &s;taff was all wrythen about with iron, from the mid&s;t upward, and &s;tood on the north end of the feretory: And the king of Scots' banner hung over the mid&s;t of the alley of the nine altars, under St Catharine's window, in the ea&s;t end of the church; and a little after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, they were all taken down, &s;poiled and defaced, that the memory thereof &s;hould be clean taken away, being both a great honour to the realm, and a decent ornament unto the church.</P>

<HEAD>St Cuthbert's &s;hrine defaced.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hrine of St Cuthbert was defaced at the vi&s;itation held at Durham, for demoli&s;hing &s;uch monuments, by Dr Lee, Dr Henley, and Mr Blithman, in king Henry the Eighth's reign, at his &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of religious hou&s;es. They found many goodly and valuable jewels, e&s;pecially one precious &s;tone, which was of value &s;uf|ficient to redeem a prince. After the &s;poil of ornaments and jewels, they approached near to his body, ex|pecting nothing but du&s;t and a&s;hes; but perceiving the che&s;t he lay in &s;trongly bound with iron, the gold|&s;mith with a &s;mith's great fore-hammer broke it open, when they found him lying whole, uncorrupt, with his face bare, and his beard as of a fortnight's growth, and all the ve&s;tments about him, as he was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay ma&s;s, and his metwand of gold lying by him. When the gold&s;mith perceived he had broken one of his legs, in breaking open the che&s;t, he was &s;ore troubled at it, and cried, Alas! I have broken one of his legs; which Dr Henley hearing, called to him, and bade him ca&s;t down his bones: The other an&s;wered he could not get them a&s;under, for the &s;inews and the &s;kin held them &s;o that they would not &s;eparate. Then Dr Lee &s;tept up to &s;ee if it were &s;o, and turning about, &s;pake in Latin to Dr Henley, that he was intire, though Dr Henley not believing his words, called again to have his bones ca&s;t down: Dr Lee an&s;wered, if you will not believe me, come up your&s;elf, and &s;ee him: Then Dr Henley &s;tept up to him, and handled him, and found he lay whole: Then he commanded them to take him down; and &s;o it happened contrary to their expectation, that not only his body was whole and uncorrupted, but the ve&s;tments wherein his body lay, and wherein he was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay ma&s;s, were fre&s;h, &s;afe, and not con&s;umed. Whereupon the vi&s;itors commanded him to be carried into the reve&s;try, till the king's plea&s;ure concerning him was further known; and upon the receipt thereof, the prior and monks buried him in the ground under the place where his &s;hrine was exalted. Davies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 1255. <Q>Henry III. beinge in thei&s;e partes, vi&s;ited St Cuthbert, (as they call it) and while he was at his devocions, a courtyer why&s;pered in his care, that dyvers by&s;hops of his had hydden muche trea&s;ure in St Cuthberte's tombe. The kinge made &s;horte, and openinge the tombe, &s;ound it to be even foe; whereupon he devi&s;ed to borowe the &s;ame, lea&s;t they &s;hould charge him with prophanation of the holye reliques: But Paris compleneth, that they weare never halfe payed againe.</Q> Lambard's Topographical and Hi&s;torical Dictionary, page 86.</P>
<P>In this new church was erected a &s;umptuous &s;hrine, called the feretory, about three yards from the ground, behind the high altar, at the ea&s;t end of the choir, where his body was &s;olemnly placed in an iron che&s;t within the &s;aid &s;hrine, where it lay quietly without mole&s;tation, till the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the church: And the book of the four evangeli&s;ts which fell into the &s;ea, and was &s;o miraculou&s;ly landed and found again, was laid on the high altar, as a fit monument to pre&s;erve the memory of &s;o great a &s;aint.</P>
<P>The&s;e holy bi&s;hops and monks, for the honour of their holy &s;aint, Aldwinus, and Ranulph Flamberd, as bi&s;hop William Carileph intended at building the new church, on the out&s;ide of the north we&s;t turret of the &s;ame altars, erected the monument of a milk-maid milking her cow, in grateful commemoration of that maid, who &s;o fortunately, in their great perplexity, directed them to Dunholme, where the body of their great &s;aint was to re&s;t until the re&s;urrection: Which monument, though defaced by the weather, is vi&s;ible at this time.</P>

<PB N="248" REF="260">to have it drawn, or to &s;ee it, the clerk of the feretory (called George Bates) gave notice to his ma&s;ter, the vice-prior, keeper of the feretory, who brought the keys of the &s;hrine, and gave them to the clerk to open it. His office then was to &s;tand by and &s;ee it drawn up. It was always drawn up in mattins time, when Te Deum was &s;inging, or in high ma&s;s time, or at even-&s;ong time when Magnificat was &s;ung. George Bates was regi&s;ter of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There was in the keeping of the vice-prior, a banner belonging to the &s;hrine, called St Cuthbert's banner, the &s;taff five yards in length; all the pipes of it were of &s;ilver, to be &s;lidden on along the banner &s;taff, and on the uppermo&s;t pipe; on the top of it was a little &s;ilver cro&s;s, and a goodly banner cloth pertaining to it, and in the mid&s;t of the banner cloth was a white velvet half a yard &s;quare, and a cro&s;s of crim&s;on velvet over it; and within the &s;aid white velvet was that holy relique, the corporax cloth, wherewith the holy man St Cuth|bert covered the chalice when he &s;aid ma&s;s; and the re&s;t of the banner cloth was of crim&s;on velvet, embroid|ered with gold and green &s;ilk mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly. The &s;aid banner was at the winning of Brankenfield battle, in king Henry the Eighth's time, and brought home with it the king of Scots' banner, and many noblemen's an|cients of Scotland; which were &s;et up in St Cuthbert's feretory, where they remained till the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e; at which time St Cuthbert's banner, and the&s;e ancients of Scotland were defaced. St Cuthbert's ban|ner was thought to be one of the mo&s;t magnificent reliques of any in England, and was not carried out but on principal days, in general proce&s;&s;ions, as Ea&s;ter day, A&s;cen&s;ion day, Whit&s;unday, Corpus Chri&s;ti day, and St Cuthbert's day, and &s;ome other fe&s;tival days. It was very ma&s;&s;y, and &s;et up at the ea&s;t end of the &s;hrine. Whenever it was carried in proce&s;&s;ion, it was the clerk's office to attend it, with his &s;urplice on, with a fine red painted &s;taff, having a fork or cleft at the upper end thereof; which cleft was lined with &s;oft &s;ilk, having down under the &s;ilk, to prevent hurting or brui&s;ing the pipes of the banner, which were of &s;ilver, or in taking it down and rai&s;ing it up again, by rea&s;on of its great weight. There were always four men to go along with it, be&s;ides the clerk, and the man who carried it.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a &s;trong girdle of white leather, that he who bore St Cuthbert's banner, did wear whenever it was carried abroad. The banner was made fa&s;t to it with two pieces of white leather, and at each end of the two pieces, a &s;ocket of horn was fa&s;tened, to put the end of the banner &s;taff into. Davies, &amp;c.</P>

The entrance to this porch or anchorage was up a part of &s;tairs adjoining to the north door of St Cuthbert's feretory, under which &s;tairs the pa&s;chal did lie, and in the time of Lent, the children of the almery were enjoined to come thither daily, to dre&s;s, trim, and make it bright again&s;t the pa&s;chal fea&s;t.</P>

By the engraving given from Mr Nichol&s;on's drawing and admea&s;urement of the whole ea&s;t end of the church, the reader will di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;imilarity of &s;tile in this tran&s;ept and the tower; and, we hope, will be convinced that the ob&s;ervation as to their date is not ill grounded: On the projections of this front are two effigies, in the printed de&s;criptions of the church &s;aid to repre&s;ent bi&s;hop William on the &s;outh, who began the pre&s;ent edifice; and on the north bi&s;hop Flambard, who tran&s;lated St Cuthbert's body to the &s;hrine pre|pared for him therein; the fir&s;t attired in his mitre and epi&s;copal in&s;ignia, the other having his head uncovered: But it is more probable they are the effigies of bi&s;hop Farnham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob. 1257.</NOTE>, and his contemporary prior Thomas of Mel&s;onby, for bi&s;hop Anthony Beke, who died in 1310, was interred near the altar of St Michael, and the wall was broken through to admit his remains; which is a proof this part of the edifice and its altars were then made. We will conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations by &s;aying, it is pre&s;umed this mo&s;t elegant part of the edifice was fini&s;hed by prior Richard de Hotoun, who, it is certain, roofed the choir, and acceded to the priory in 1289. The pila&s;ters of this tran&s;ept, from whence ri&s;e the groins of the roof, are of an angular projection, light and elegant: On each &s;ide of the great window the pila&s;ters con&s;i&s;t of a clu&s;ter of &s;mall circular columns, one of larger dimen&s;ion in front, and &s;ix on each &s;ide to form the projecting angle, belted in two places at in|tervals, with a triple roll, the capitals pierced in flowers; the pila&s;ters between each window are compo&s;ed of a front column, and four on each &s;ide, in an angler pro|jection, belted and capitalled as the larger ones; every other column is of black marble, the intermediate ones of white free &s;tone, which had a beautiful effect be|fore they were, from the mi&s;taken zeal of reformation, daubed over and concealed as they now remain, with wa&s;hing and oker. Under each tier of windows a gal|lery runs the whole length of the tran&s;ept: The nine altars were placed one under each window to the ea&s;t, the wall ornamented with &s;hort pila&s;ters and open niches in the ro&s;e figure, exactly &s;imilar to the gallery of the dome: The vaulted roof is ribbed, the ribs meet on three circles; the &s;illetings of the ribs are pierced like tho&s;e of the choir, with ro&s;es and cro&s;&s;es: The circles are beautifully ornamented, the mo&s;t northern one being pierced with a rich garland of flowers; that in the center is &s;culptured with four figures finely relieved, repre&s;enting the evangeli&s;ts

<P>The gallilee at the we&s;t end of the church, as was ob&s;erved before, was by ancient authors &s;aid to be appropriated by bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, for the reception of women, being originally de&s;igned for the &s;ervice of proce&s;&s;ions: It is in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t fifty feet, and from north to &s;outh eighty feet; divided into five ailes, by four rows of pillars, running ea&s;t and we&s;t; three pillars and two pila&s;ters, in each range; the pillars formed of four &s;mall round columns placed together, who&s;e ba&s;e is only two feet &s;quare; the pila&s;ters con&s;i&s;t of two round columns, de|tached from the walls, their capitals ornamented with a leaf and mouldings; the arches are circular, and cut underneath and on the &s;ides with the zig-zag figure; the roof is not vaulted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A plate in Smith's Life of Bede.</NOTE>: It is lighted with three large windows to the we&s;t, with flat or elliptic arches, and one &s;maller window at each extremity under pointed arches; to the &s;outh, four windows with pointed arches; the north &s;ide is built up, and u&s;ed for the regi&s;ter's office: The old entrance was from the north, by a &s;mall yard adjoin|ing to the church-yard, &s;o that the women need not come within the gates of the church: The door circular, with pila&s;ters and mouldings, greatly decayed.

<P>For the comfort of all women and &s;olace of their &s;oul, there was an ancient church in the Fern I&s;land, where the church of that town now &s;tandeth; which was appointed for women to repair unto for hearing of ma&s;s, and receiving the &s;acraments. For which purpo&s;e here was a chapel dedicated to the ble&s;&s;ed virgin Mary, now called the gallilee.</P>
<P>Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, con&s;idering the diligence of his predece&s;&s;ors in building the cathedral church, fini&s;hed but a few years before his time, and no chapel being then erected to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, whereunto it &s;hould be lawful for women to have acce&s;s, began to erect a new work at the ea&s;t angle of the cathedral, for which &s;everal pillars of marble were brought from beyond &s;ea; and the work being advanced to a &s;mall height, begun, through great clifts therein, to fall down; whence it manife&s;tly appeared unacceptable to God and holy St Cuthbert. Whereupon that work was left off, and a new one begun and &s;oon fini&s;hed, at the we&s;t end of the church for women</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="271">It is called the gallilee, by rea&s;on, as &s;ome think, of the tran&s;lation thereof; being once begun, and after|wards removed; to which place who&s;oever re&s;orted, had the benefit of &s;undry pardons, as appears by a table there &s;et up, containing a catalogue thereof.</P>
<P>Within the gallilee, in a chantry made of blue marble, &s;tood our Lady's altar, a &s;umptuous monument, finely adorned with curious wain&s;cot work; the wain&s;cot furni&s;hed with pictures, in colours and gilding; there ma&s;s was &s;ung daily by the ma&s;ter of the &s;ong-&s;chool, with certain deacons and chori&s;ters, the ma&s;ters playing upon a fine organ in time of ma&s;s; wherein the founder, bi&s;hop Langley, was mo&s;t devoutly prayed for: This bi&s;hop magnificently rebuilt the &s;aid gallilee. There belonged to this altar very &s;umptuous furniture, not only for principal fea&s;ts, but for ordinary &s;ervice: And for &s;afe-keeping tho&s;e ve&s;tments, and other ornaments be|longing to the &s;aid altar, there was at both ends behind the portal two clo&s;e almeries of wain&s;cot.</P>
<P>Thomas Langley, bi&s;hop of Durham, lies buried under a marble tomb, within the &s;aid chantry, before our Lady's altar.</P>
<P>On the north &s;ide of the gallilee was an altar, called the Lady of Pittie's altar, with her picture, carrying our Saviour on her knee, as he was taken from the cro&s;s. This altar was intended for a chantry prie&s;t to &s;ay ma&s;s at every day, having above the altar on the wall, a part of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion in large pictures, the other part being above St Bede's altar, on the &s;outh &s;ide.</P>
<P>There was on the &s;outh &s;ide, between two pillars, a beautiful monument of blue marble, a yard high, &s;up|ported by five pillars, one at every corner, and the fifth under the middle; and above the &s;aid marble &s;tone and pillars &s;tood a &s;econd &s;hrine, to St Cuthbert's, wherein the bones of St Bede were in&s;hrined: It u&s;ed to be taken down every fe&s;tival day, when there was any &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, and carried by four monks in time of proce&s;&s;ion and divine &s;ervice. It is not improper to tran&s;cribe the following ver&s;es from the ancient hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, having fini&s;hed the chapel called the gallilee, cau&s;ed a feretory of gold and &s;ilver to be made, wherein were depo&s;ited the bones of Venerable Bede. In the lower part of the work, the following Latin ver&s;es were engraven:
<Q><L>Continet haec Theca Bedae venerablis o&s;&s;a,</L>
<L>Sen&s;um factori Chri&s;tus dedit atque datori:</L>
<L>Petrus opus fecit, Praeful dedit hoc Hugo donum:</L>
<L>Sic in utroque &s;uum, veneratus utrumque Patronum.</L>
<L>Anno Milleno ter Centum, &s;eptuageno</L>
<L>Po&s;tquam Salvator carnem de Virgine &s;ump&s;it</L>
<L>Tran&s;tulit hoc Feretrum Cuthberti de prope tumba,</L>
<L>I&s;tius Eccle&s;iae Prior hic, po&s;cente Richardo</L>
<L>De Ca&s;tro dicti Bernardi, cujus &amp; o&s;&s;a.</L>
<L>Non procul hinc lapide &s;ub marmoreo requie&s;cunt.</L></Q></P>
<P>It appears that the bones of St Bede were fir&s;t laid in the mona&s;tery of Jarrow, and afterwards brought to Durham, and placed in a golden coffin on the right &s;ide of the body of St Cuthbert.</P>
<P>Egfridus, a prie&s;t in that time, viz. 1319, did affirm, that one coffin contained both the body of St Cuthbert, and the bones of the venerable Dr Bede.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of the gallilee was St Bede's altar, before which his bones and reliques lay, where his &s;hrine was, to who&s;e memory an elegant epitaph fairly written on vellum hangs upon the adjoining wall.&mdash;See p. 259.</P>
<P>The reverend Sir George Wheler, knight, one of the prebendaries of this cathedral, a true admirer of Vene|rable Bede, had &s;everal of his children buried near him, and ordered his own body to be interred as near Bede's tomb as it conveniently could, without violating the &s;acred a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the bottom of the great window, in the we&s;t end of the gallilee, was a fine iron pulpit, with iron rails to &s;upport the monks in going up, of whom one did preach every holiday and Sunday, at one o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>At the we&s;t end of the &s;outh angle was a font for baptizing children, when the kingdom was interdicted by the pope; which Thomas Langley, bi&s;hop of Durham, procured as a privilege, upon &s;pecial favour at the pope's hands.</P>
<P>In the we&s;t end of the gallilee are four finely coloured windows.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t towards the &s;outh are three lights; the middle having in it the picture of Chri&s;t crucified, curiou&s;ly painted, with the &s;un and moon above the head thereof; in the highe&s;t part of which light is the picture of the &s;tar that appeared to the three wi&s;e men; together with the picture of the virgin Mary, with Chri&s;t naked, &s;itting upon her knee.</P>
<P>In the light towards the north, is pictured in coloured gla&s;s, the Almighty, having in his hand a ball or globe: And under that the Salutation; and the picture of the Holy Gho&s;t appearing in the likene&s;s of a dove.</P>
<P>In the light towards the &s;outh is the picture of our ble&s;&s;ed Lady, as &s;he was taken up into Heaven, glorified and crowned; and underneath a lively picture of our ble&s;&s;ed Lady, with Chri&s;t new born, naked, &s;itting on her knee, and &s;ucking her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd, containing &s;ix fine lights of gla&s;s, &s;evered, three above and three below.</P>
<P>The middle light above contains the picture of St Cuthbert, in his ordinary epi&s;copal ve&s;tments, the image of St O&s;wald's head painted on his brea&s;t, &s;upported with his right-hand, in fine coloured gla&s;s. Under his
<PB N="258" REF="272">feet is written, Sanctus Cuthbertus quondam Lindisfarnen&s;is epi&s;copus, hujus eccle&s;iae &amp; patriae maximus patronus.</P>
<P>The light on the north &s;ide of St Cuthbert has the picture of St Bede, in his blue habit; under his feet is wrote, Sanctus Beda, qui vitam St Cuthberti, &amp; multa alia, ab eccle&s;ia approbata con&s;crip&s;it; cujus o&s;&s;a, in hac capella in feretro contenta.</P>
<P>The light on the &s;outh &s;ide of St Cuthbert hath the picture of Aidanus the bi&s;hop, in fine coloured gla&s;s, as he was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay ma&s;s; Under his feet is written, Sanctus Aidanus epi&s;copus Lindisfarnen&s;is eccle&s;iae primus; primus in hac &s;ancti&s;&s;ima Dunelmen&s;i eccle&s;ia, fuit prioratus.</P>
<P>Under which three lights, by partitions, are three very curious and larger pictures, in fine coloured gla&s;s, containing the images of Aidanus, Edmundus, and Eata, three bi&s;hops of Lindisfarne, as they were accu&s;tom|ed to &s;ay ma&s;s. Under Eata's picture is Sanctus Eata Lindisfarnen&s;is epi&s;copus.</P>
<P>And above, in the highe&s;t part of this window, are &s;ix little glazed lights, in tower manner, in fine coloured gla&s;s, containing part of the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's nativity, the marriage in Galilee, and his miracles done upon earth.</P>
<P>In the third window are al&s;o &s;ix lights parted as before; in the highe&s;t part are three pictures, in fine colour|ed gla&s;s; the middle being the image of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin Mary, with Chri&s;t in her arms, under who&s;e feet is written, Sancta Maria.</P>
<P>On the north &s;ide of her is the picture of St O&s;wald, king, in coloured gla&s;s, with a beautiful cro&s;s in his hand; under who&s;e feet is, Sanctus O&s;waldus fundator &s;edis epi&s;copalis Lindisfarnen&s;is, quae nunc e&s;t Dunel|men&s;is: Cujus anima in feretro St Cuthberti e&s;t humata.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of her is the picture of holy king Henry, in fine coloured gla&s;s, with his &s;ceptre in his hand; under who&s;e feet is written, Rex Henricus.</P>
<P>Under tho&s;e, in three large lights, and fir&s;t oppo&s;ite to St Mary is placed the picture of Thomas Langley, bi&s;hop, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay ma&s;s, having his arms excellently blazoned above his head; under whom is written, Thomas Langley, rector eccle&s;iae, ad honorem Dei, epi&s;copus Dunelmen&s;is; &amp; duas cantarias in eadem fun|davit &amp; dotavit.</P>
<P>And under St O&s;wald's, is the picture of bi&s;hop Wilfridus, in fine coloured gla&s;s, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay ma&s;s; under who&s;e feet is, Sanctus Wilfridus primo Lindisfarnen&s;is monachus, po&s;t abbas Ripen&s;is, ultimo archiepi&s;|copus Eboracen&s;is; uno anno rexit epi&s;copatum Lindisfarnen&s;em.</P>
<P>And under king Henry is the picture of bi&s;hop Cedda, in fine coloured gla&s;s, as accu&s;tomed to &s;ay ma&s;s; under his feet, Sanctus Cedda, primo Lindisfarnen&s;is monachus, po&s;t abbas in Le&s;tingham, tribus annis rexit archiepi&s;copatum Eboracen&s;em, &amp; etiam rexit epi&s;copatum Lichfelden&s;em.</P>
<P>In this window, above the former, are &s;ix little glazed tower windows, repre&s;enting the flight of Jo&s;eph and Mary with our Saviour into Egypt, being pur&s;ued by Herod, together with mo&s;t part of the &s;tory thereof.</P>
<P>In the fourth window al&s;o there are &s;ix fine lights, &s;evered as before, containing in the higher part three large pictures in three lights, being the images of three holy kings, great benefactors to the church, and to St Cuthbert, viz. Alured, Guthred, and Elfrid, in their royal apparel, with &s;cepters in their hands, in fine co|loured gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Under them are, in large pictures, in fine coloured gla&s;s, three bi&s;hops of Lindisfarne, as they u&s;ed to &s;ay ma&s;s: Under their feet is to be &s;een, Sanctus Egfridus Lindisfarnen&s;is. Sanctus Ethelwoldus Lindisfarnen&s;is.</P>
<P>Under the third, no writing to be &s;een, but Epi&s;copus.</P>
<P>In the highe&s;t part of this window are &s;ix little tower windows, finely coloured and glazed, containing the mo&s;t part of the &s;tory of Chri&s;t's death, burial, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion, mo&s;t excellently pictured in fine coloured gla&s;s.</P>
<P>St Bede's &s;hrine defaced.</P>
<P>The &s;hrine of holy St Bede, before mentioned in the gallilee, was defaced by the vi&s;itors, and his bones were interred under the &s;ame place, where before his body was exalted.</P>

<HEAD>The we&s;t alley of the cloi&s;ters.</HEAD>
<P>In the we&s;t alley of the cloi&s;ters, a little to the &s;outh of the dormitory door, was a &s;trong hou&s;e, called the trea&s;ury, having a &s;trong door, and two locks upon it. In the mid&s;t of the hou&s;e was a &s;trong grate of iron fixed in the ground-work, and in the roof, and fa&s;tened in each wall the breadth of the hou&s;e, &s;o fa&s;t as not to be ea&s;ily broken. In the mid&s;t of the grate was an iron door, with a &s;trong lock, and two great &s;lots of iron to guard it; and within the grate was a &s;quare table covered with green cloth, for telling their money. With|in this trea&s;ury were al&s;o kept the evidences of the hou&s;e, and the chapter &s;eal; as al&s;o the evidences of &s;everal gentlemen's lands in the country, who thought them &s;afer than in their own cu&s;tody, in three great che&s;ts well locked in the &s;aid trea&s;ury, but afterwards it was altered; their trea&s;ure and money being kept in a &s;trong hou&s;e over the ea&s;t gates of the abbey in the South Bailey, now called the exchequer; but in the &s;aid old trea&s;ury the common chapter &s;eal is &s;till kept.</P>
<P>Over-again&s;t the &s;aid trea&s;ury-hou&s;e door was a &s;tall of wain&s;cot, where the novices were taught; no &s;tran|gers or other per&s;ons being permitted to mole&s;t the novices, or the monks in their carrels, while at &s;tudy in the cloi&s;ters; a porter attending for that purpo&s;e at the cloi&s;ter door.</P>
<P>A little &s;outh of the trea&s;ury was the &s;ong-&s;chool, for the in&s;truction of boys, for the u&s;e of the choir; the &s;ong-&s;chool in the &s;outh i&s;le of the lanthern being decently furni&s;hed with a reading de&s;k, convenient &s;eats, and all other requi&s;ites, where prayer was daily celebrated at &s;ix in the morning, except on Sundays and holidays.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The dormitory.</HEAD>
<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of the cloi&s;ters was a large hou&s;e, called the dorter, where the monks and novices lay. Every monk had a little chamber to him&s;elf. Each chamber had a window towards the chapter, and the partition betwixt every chamber was clo&s;e wain&s;cotted, and in each window was a de&s;k to &s;upport their books. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid dorter were the like chambers, with their windows and de&s;ks towards the infirmary and the water; the chambers being all well boarded.</P>
<P>The novices had likewi&s;e their chambers in the &s;outh end of the &s;aid dorter, adjoining to the afore&s;aid chambers, having eight chambers on each &s;ide. Every novice had his chamber to him&s;elf, not having any light but what came in at the fore&s;ide of their chambers.</P>
<P>At each end of the dorter was a &s;quare &s;tone, wherein was a dozen of cre&s;&s;ets wrought in each &s;tone, being always filled and &s;upplied by the cooks, as they needed, to afford light to the monks and novices, at their ari&s;ing to their mattins at midnight, and for their other nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es.</P>
<P>There was a decent place adjoining to the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid dorter, towards the water, called the privies. Two great pillars of &s;tone &s;upported the whole floor thereof; and every &s;eat and partition was wain&s;cotted clo&s;e on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>In the dorter every night a private &s;earch was made by the &s;ub-prior, who called at every monk's chamber|door, to &s;ee good order kept, and that none &s;hould be wanting. The middle part of it was paved with fine tile &s;tones the whole length: The &s;ub-prior's chamber was the fir&s;t, as he was to &s;ee order kept.</P>
<P>The &s;ub-prior always dined and &s;upped with the convent, &s;itting at the upper end of the table; and &s;upper being ended, which was always at five o'clock, upon ringing a bell to call one of the novices to &s;ay grace, they went to the chapter-hou&s;e to meet the prior, there to remain in prayer and devotion till &s;ix o'clock. Then upon ringing a bell again they went to the <HI>&s;alvi,</HI> and all the doors of the cells, the frater-hou&s;e, the dorter, and the cloi&s;ters, were locked, even at &s;ix o'clock, and the keys delivered to the &s;ub-prior, till &s;even o'clock the next morning.</P>

<HEAD>The Loft.</HEAD>
<P>There was a door in the we&s;t end of the frater-hou&s;e, at which the old monks entered, and then a&s;cended up a pair of &s;tairs, having an iron rail into a loft which was at the we&s;t end of the frater-hou&s;e, above the cellar, where the convent and monks dined and &s;upped together. The &s;ub-prior &s;at at the upper end of the table, as chief; and they had their meat &s;erved from the great kitchen, in at the dre&s;&s;er-window, and brought through the frater-hou&s;e: The &s;aid kitchen &s;erved both the prior and the whole convent, having two windows into the frater-hou&s;e; the one was large for principal days, the other not &s;o large for every day. At the foot of the &s;tairs was another door, leading into the great cellar or buttery, where all the drink &s;tood that &s;erved the whole convent.</P>
<P>This loft, &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;try, was made the dining-room of the fifth prebendary's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The monks were accu&s;tomed every day after dinner, to go through the cloi&s;ters, in at the u&s;her's door, and &s;o through the entry under the prior's lodgings into the centry-garth, where the monks were buried, where they all &s;tood bareheaded a good &s;pace, praying among the tombs for the &s;ouls of their brethren who were buried there: And when they had done their prayers, they returned to the cloi&s;ter, and &s;taid till three o'clock, that they went to even-&s;ong.</P>
<P>The monks were the only writers of the acts and deeds of the bi&s;hops and priors of the church, and of other chronicles and hi&s;tories: They likewi&s;e recorded other mo&s;t valuable things, as what acts, what occurrences, and what miracles were performed every year. Such were the labours of monks and religious men in ancient times.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The Common Hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>On the right hand at going out of the cloi&s;ters into the infirmary, was the common-hou&s;e. It was to have a fire con&s;tantly by day in winter, for the u&s;e of the monks, who were allowed no other fire; but the ma&s;ter and officers of the hou&s;e had their own &s;everal fires. A garden and bowling alley belonged to the &s;aid hou&s;e, towards the water, for the novices to recreate them&s;elves, leave being fir&s;t granted; their ma&s;ter attending to &s;ee to their good order. In this hou&s;e once in the year, between Martinmas and Chri&s;tmas, the ma&s;ter of it kept his <HI>O Sapientia,</HI> a &s;olemn banquet, at which the prior and convent were entertained with figs, rai&s;ins, ale, and cakes, but not to exce&s;s, being only a moderate &s;chola&s;tical congratulation among them&s;elves.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The Infirmary.</HEAD>
<P>Within the infirmary, underneath the ma&s;ter's lodge, was a &s;trong pri&s;on, called the lying-hou&s;e, ordained for great offenders; as for monks guilty of felony or adultery, where they were impri&s;oned in chains a whole year, without &s;eeing any one, except the ma&s;ter of the infirmary, in letting down their meat through a trap|door by a cord, and that at a great di&s;tance from the pri&s;oners. But if any of the temporal men belonging to the hou&s;e offended in the premi&s;&s;es, they were puni&s;hed by the temporal law.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>The Gue&s;t-hall.</HEAD>
<P>A famous hou&s;e of ho&s;pitality was kept within the abbey-garth, called the gue&s;t-hall and was &s;ituate on the we&s;t &s;ide towards the water. The <HI>terrer</HI> of the hou&s;e was ma&s;ter thereof, appointed to give entertainment to all e&s;tates, noble, gentle, or what other degree &s;oever came thither as &s;trangers. Their entertainment was not inferior to that of any place in England, both for the goodne&s;s of their diet, the clean and neat furniture of their lodgings, and all things nece&s;&s;ary for travellers; and no man was required to depart while he continued hone&s;t, and of good behaviour.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es belonging to the &s;econd, third, fourth and tenth prebendaries, were erected out of the apart|ments and other offices belonging to the gue&s;t-hall, the hall it&s;elf being wholly demoli&s;hed, nothing remaining except a part of the we&s;tern wall: But nothing remains to let us know what was in the &s;ixth and twelfth pre|bendaries hou&s;es.</P>
<P>This hall was a &s;tately place, not unlike the body of the church, &s;upported on each &s;ide by very fine pillars, and in the mid&s;t of the hall a large range for the fire. The chambers and lodgings belonging to it were kept very clean, and richly furni&s;hed. They were very plea&s;ant to lie in e&s;pecially one chamber, called the king's chamber, well de&s;erving that name; &s;uch was the &s;tateline&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>The victuals the gue&s;ts were entertained with came from the great kitchen of the prior, the bread and beer from his pantry and cellars. If they were honourable, they were &s;erved as honourably as the prior him&s;elf, otherwi&s;e according to their quality.</P>
<P>The <HI>terrer</HI> had certain men appointed to wait at his table, and to attend upon his gue&s;ts and &s;trangers; and for their better entertainment he had always a hog&s;head or two of wines kept in a cellar pertaining to the &s;aid hall</P>
<P>The prior (who&s;e ho&s;pitality was &s;uch as that, in reality there was no need of the gue&s;t-hall, but that the convent was de&s;irous to abound in all liberal and free alm&s;givings) kept a mo&s;t &s;plendid and noble hou&s;e being attended by the be&s;t gentlemen and yeomen in the country, and the magnificent &s;ervice of his hou&s;e de&s;erved no le&s;s; con&s;tant relief and alms were daily given, not only to the poor of the city, but to tho&s;e of the country round about.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="277">The lord prior had two porters, one at the hall door, called Robert Smith, the other at the u&s;her door, at going from the great chamber to the church, called Robert Clark; which two were the la&s;t porters to the la&s;t prior.</P>
<P>There were certain poor children, called the children of the almery, who were educated in learning, and re|lieved with the alms and benevolence of the whole hou&s;e, having their meat and drink in a loft on the north &s;ide of the abbey gates, before the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid hou&s;e. This loft had a long &s;lated porch over the &s;tair-head, and at each &s;ide of the &s;aid porch were &s;tairs to go up to the loft, with a &s;table underneath it, and a door into it, under the &s;tair-head, to go into the &s;aid &s;table. This edifice, at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, be|came Mr Stephen Marley's lodging. Soon after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion he altered it, and took down the porch and &s;tairs that went up to the loft, and made a kitchen where the &s;table was, and his buttery above where the loft was. The children went to &s;chool at the infirmary &s;chool without the abbey gates. The la&s;t &s;choolma&s;ter was Sir Robert Hartburne, who continued ma&s;ter till the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e. He was bound to &s;ay ma&s;s twice a week at Magdalen's chapel, near Kepier, and once a week at Kimble&s;worth. The meat and drink the&s;e children had, was what the monks and novices with their ma&s;ter had left It was carried in at a door adjoining the great kitchen window, into a little vault at the we&s;t end of the frater-hou&s;e, like a pantry, called the covie. Within it was a window, at which &s;ome of the children received the meat and drink out of the covie or pantry window, and carried it to the loft. This clerk waited on them at every meal to keep good order.</P>
<P>There were four aged women who lived in the infirmary, without the &s;outh gates of the abbey, each having her &s;everal chamber to lie in, being &s;upplied and fed only with the victuals that came from the prior's own table.</P>
<P>In the infirmary was a chapel, where the &s;choolma&s;ter of the infirmary, (having his chamber and &s;chool above it) or &s;ome other prie&s;t for him, was appointed to &s;ay ma&s;s to the&s;e aged women every holiday and Friday.&mdash;Davies, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The cu&s;tom of the church of Durham in burying of monks.</HEAD>
<P>The monk, &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s, was conveyed, with all his furniture, &amp;c. from his chamber in the dormi|tory, to another in the infirmary, in order to have both fire and more convenient attendance; no fire being allowed in the dormitory.</P>
<P>And when his attendants perceived that he could not live, they &s;ent for the prior's chaplain, who &s;taid with him till he yielded up the gho&s;t: Then the barber was &s;ent for, who&s;e office it was to put down the cloths and uncover him, and to put on his feet-&s;ocks and boots, and to wind him in his cowl and habit. Thence he was carried to a chamber called the dead man's chamber, in the infirmary, there to remain till night. At night he was removed into St Andrew's chapel, adjoining to the &s;aid chamber and infirmary, there to remain till eight o'clock in the morning, the chapel being a place ordained only for &s;olemn devotion. The night be|fore the funeral two monks were appointed by the prior to be mourners, and to &s;it all night on their knees at the feet of the corp&s;e; and the children of the almery &s;itting on their knees, in the &s;talls on each &s;ide, were to read David's p&s;alms till eight in the morning, when the corp&s;e was carried to the chapter-hou&s;e, where the prior and the whole convent met it, and there &s;aid their dirge; none being permitted to approach the chapter-hou&s;e during the time of their prayers for his &s;oul: When ended, the corp&s;e was carried by the monks from the chapter-hou&s;e through the parlour, the place where merchants u&s;ed to utter their wares, &s;tanding betwixt the chapter-hou&s;e and church-door, and &s;o through the &s;aid parlour into the centry-garth, where he was buried and a chalice of wax laid upon his brea&s;t, having his blue bed held over his grave by four monks, during the funeral: Which bed is due to the barber for his duty afore&s;aid, and making his grave. At the time of his burial only one peal was rung.</P>
<P>The priors of the hou&s;e of Durham, were accu&s;tomed in ancient time, to be buried in their boots, and wound in their cowls by the barber&punc; as the monks u&s;ed to be buried.</P>
<P>The priors, in later times, were buried within the church in the &s;ame order and habit, with the mitre and all other furniture, as their predece&s;&s;ors were buried.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops of Durham u&s;ed in ancient times to be buried in the chapter-hou&s;e, they not pre&s;uming to lie nearer the holy body of St Cuthbert. Their names are graven upon the &s;tones under which they lie, with a cro&s;s at the beginning of each name.</P>

<P>The cu&s;tom of burying bi&s;hops in the chapter-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops of Durham, when they died, were brought to the abbey church to be interred; and the prior and monks met the corp&s;e at the church-yard gates on the place-green, where they received and carried him through the church into the chapter-hou&s;e: Great &s;olemnity and devotion, according to the ancient cu&s;tom was u&s;ed. The cu&s;tom was, to bury them with their albe, &s;tole, phannel, and other ve&s;tments wherein they u&s;ed to &s;ay ma&s;s, a mitre on the head, and a cro&s;ier &s;taff in his hand, and &s;o laid in the coffin, with a little chalice of &s;ilver, other metal, or wax, placed on the brea&s;t; which wax chalice, and the knobs, and the edge of the patten or cover, and the ba&s;e were gilded.</P>
<P>The prior and monks had the hor&s;es, chariot, and all other things that came with the decea&s;ed, due to them by ancient cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>But afterwards the bi&s;hops were buried in the church; as their predece&s;&s;ors were in the chapter-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the ea&s;t end of the chapter-hou&s;e there is a yard, called the centry-garth, where all the priors and monks were buried. In this garth was a vault made to be a charnel-hou&s;e, to put dead men's bones in.</P>
<P>There were many gentlemen of great worth buried in the centry-garth, who de&s;ired to lie near holy St Cuthbert; and among others Mr Racket, who had a fine tomb of white marble, whereon he was pictured in bra&s;s, in his coat of armour, and his &s;word girt about him; and at every corner of the marble was an evangeli&s;t in bra&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr Elmeden was buried in the &s;aid garth, with a fine tomb-&s;tone upon him: And divers others, who&s;e monuments are peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The priors buried in the centry-garth had each a tomb-&s;tone, either of marble or free &s;tone, which dean Whittingham cau&s;ed to be pulled down and taken away; and broke and defaced all &s;uch &s;tones as had any pictures of bra&s;s, or other imagery work, or chalices wrought upon them; and the re&s;t he took away, and employed them in making a wa&s;hing-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Within the church were two marble holy water &s;tones, bo&s;&s;ed with hollow bo&s;&s;es on the out&s;ides, curiou&s;ly wrought. The&s;e were taken away by dean Whittingham, and removed into his kitchen.</P>
<P>In the centry-garth under the &s;outh end of the nine altars, betwixt two pillars, was a &s;ong-&s;chool, erected for teaching &s;ix children to &s;ing, who had their meat and drink among the children of the almery, at the ex|pence of the hou&s;e. The ma&s;ter had his chamber adjoining to the &s;ong-&s;chool, and his diet in the prior's-hall, among the prior's gentlemen.&mdash;Davies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>William, bi&s;hop of Durham, before he took down Aldwinus's old fabrick, prepared a beautiful tomb of &s;tone in the cloi&s;ter-garth, a yard above the ground, where St Cuthbert was depo&s;ited, over which was laid a large marble. But when his body was tran&s;lated to the &s;eretory, made a large and curious marble image, repre|&s;enting St Cuthbert, with beautiful gilding and painting, in the form he was wont to &s;ay ma&s;s, which was placed upon the tomb-&s;tone as &s;oon as his body was in&s;hrined in the new church, and round the &s;ame were &s;et up wooden &s;tanchels, &s;o clo&s;e that a man could only look through it, to view that exqui&s;ite picture. It was covered above with lead, not unlike a chapel. This elegant monument &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the parlour door, now turned into a &s;tore-hou&s;e, having rooms above where the regi&s;ter-office is kept. Soon after the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion, dean Horne demoli&s;hed this fine monument, converting the lead to his own u&s;e; the image of St Cuth|bert he left perfect. But when dean Whittingham began to govern, he cau&s;ed this image to be defaced and broken.</P>

<P>Bi&s;hops Skirlaw and Langley were the builders of the cloi&s;ters. The fir&s;t gave two hundred pounds in his life-time, and by will four hundred pounds, for that purpo&s;e. The &s;econd gave two hundred and thirty-eight pounds &s;eventeen &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence. The&s;e two were at the charge of the building and workman&s;hip, and cau&s;ed to be painted on the gla&s;s in the windows, from the cloi&s;ter door to the church door, the whole &s;tory and miracles of St Cuthbert. In king Edward the Sixth's days, this hi&s;tory was taken down by dean Horne, and broken to pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="280">There was a godly ceremony practi&s;ed by the prior and monks every Maunday Thur&s;day, viz. the Thur&s;|day before Ea&s;ter. Eighteen aged poor men were appointed to come to the cloi&s;ter that day, having their feet fir&s;t clean wa&s;hed, there to remain till the prior and the convent came, which was about nine o'clock. They &s;at between the parlour door and the church door, on a long form, and the prior wa&s;hed the poor men's feet, one after another, and dried them with a towel, and ki&s;&s;ed them. When he had done this, he be&s;towed thirty pence in money, on each of them, and &s;even red herrings a-piece; and &s;erved them with drink, three loaves of bread, and certain wafer cakes.</P>
<P>At going out of the cloi&s;ters, through an entry into the deanry, at the top of the &s;tairs, behind the door called the u&s;her-door, on the right-hand, was another going into the regi&s;ter, wherein certain old written books of the records and evidences of the hou&s;e were laid; as al&s;o a copy of the foundation of Greatham ho&s;pital, which was al&s;o regi&s;tered in the &s;aid book of records.

<P>The Rev. John Milner made an alphabetical catalogue of the printed books; and Elias Smith an index, in cla&s;&s;ical order, of the MSS. He died in 1677.</P>
<P>Among the MSS. is a written copy of bi&s;hop U&s;her's &s;ermon preached at Oxford, 1641. Henry Wilkin|&s;on, who it is &s;uppo&s;ed took down this &s;ermon in &s;hort-hand, was head of Magdalen-Hall. Codex 21.</P>
<P>There is a MS. of Ca&s;&s;idorus upon the P&s;alms, in Saxon characters, with this in&s;cription on the front,&mdash; "Ca&s;&s;idorus &s;up' P&s;alterium de manu Bedae," written in another hand and letter, not above four hundred years old, which, though of no great authority, &s;hews the tradition of the cloi&s;ter.</P>

We would not have multiplied the&s;e proofs, but to deduce from thence the following ob&s;ervations: It has been apprehended that the mintage of our prelates was carried on in &s;ome &s;trong place within the gates of the ca&s;tle; or as others would have it, in Silver-&s;treet, from its name; whereas the records prove the mint-ma&s;ter's hou&s;e was on the Place-Green; which was &s;tiled to be in the ca&s;tle, as being within the ballium and fortifications thereof.</P>
<P>There were anciently belonging to the mona&s;tery two &s;chools, one in the cloi&s;ter where the novices were taught, in a wain&s;cotted hall oppo&s;ite to the trea&s;ury door. The ma&s;ter was one of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t learned of the monks, and the &s;tudents were &s;upplied, upon his report, with nece&s;&s;aries from the chamberlain of the hou&s;e; for they had no appointed &s;alary.

&s;tudies under the di&s;cipline of the hou&s;e, were taught to perform the &s;ervice of the choir, and in the end admitted to &s;ing ma&s;s; at which &s;tage they had twenty &s;hil|lings a year as wages: They had commons at a table at the ea&s;t end of the frater-hou&s;e, and during the me&s;s one of them read a portion of the holy &s;criptures. Their lodging was at the &s;outh end of the dormitory. The other &s;chool was in the infirmary out of the abbey gates, where the boys of the almery were taught; they me&s;&s;ed after the novices, and had the remains of their table: Their ma&s;ter had ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical duty, &s;aying ma&s;s twice a week at St Mary Magdalen's chapel, near Kepier, once a week at Kimble&s;worth, and every holiday and Friday in the infir|mary chapel, where four women con&s;tantly attended, who dwelt in the infirmary, to take care of the &s;ick, and were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions from the priors table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide auditor's office.</NOTE>. The&s;e appointments, with the re&s;t of the mona&s;tic di&s;po&s;itions, were extingui&s;hed by the di&s;&s;olution, and perhaps occa&s;ioned the in&s;titution of the other &s;chools after the &s;ettlement of the chapter. John Newton, ma&s;ter of St Edmond's ho&s;pital, in Gate&s;head, and John Thoralby, rector of Gate&s;head, and afterwards of Whitburn, clerks, by bi&s;hop Langley's licence, dated the 14th of June, 1414, founded two chanteries at the altars of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin and St Cuthbert, in the gallilee, and appointed two chaplains, one of whom was to teach poor boys grammar, and the other &s;inging, in &s;uch place as that prelate or his executors &s;hould appoint: Their &s;tipend of forty &s;hillings yearly each, i&s;&s;ued out of lands in Hardwick, nigh Norton, Ryton, Boldon, Ca&s;&s;op, and Owengate, in the North-Bailey. The boys, it is pre|&s;umed, from the in&s;trument of confirmation by the prior and convent were to con|&s;i&s;t of thirty of the mona&s;tery almery: The &s;ong-ma&s;ter, with &s;ome of his &s;cholars, were to come to church on the principal fe&s;tivals in a &s;urplice, and &s;ing; the others to be pre&s;ent on the like occa&s;ions; and no women were to be permitted among them: The chantry clerks were not &s;uffered to lie a night out of their hou&s;e, with|out licence of the bi&s;hop, or his &s;piritual chancellor, under the penalty of forfeit|ing the chantry; neither might they, (with any licence) be ab&s;ent above forty days <HI>conjunctim aut divi&s;im</HI> in a whole year, and then to have a &s;ub&s;titute. They could not be admitted without licence of the bi&s;hop, or during the vacancy of the prior and chapter, in which expre&s;s mention was to be made of their taking the oath of re&s;idence. The bi&s;hop had power to add to or detract from the articles of founda|tion, to appoint &s;tatutes, or alter and explain them at plea&s;ure <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">3d Chartulary, p. 284, 285, 286, 287.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There appears &s;ome confu&s;ion touching the&s;e chantries; whether only one was founded by Newton and Thoralby, and the other was the act of bi&s;hop Langley; for in the nomination of &s;ome of the clerks, one of them is called bi&s;hop Langley's chantry. Bi&s;hop Nevil, in the fir&s;t year of his epi&s;copacy, granted licence to the executors of bi&s;hop Langley, to purcha&s;e lands of forty pounds per annum value, for maintenance of the&s;e chantry clerks <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Rot.

After the di&s;&s;olution, it is to be apprehended, things of this nature remained &s;ome time in confu&s;ion; two new &s;chools were in&s;tituted in the &s;econd year of queen Mary, under the protection of the dean and chapter; and the queen appointed &s;tipends to be paid thereto, out of the revenues of the church: And though it doth not appear the dean and chapter had any right to intermeddle with the money i&s;&s;uing out of Kaverdley, in Lanca&s;hire, yet certain it is, a cu&s;tom aro&s;e in the beginning of queen Elizabeth's reign, to pay one half of the &s;tipend that belonged to one of bi&s;hop Langley's &s;chools, to the ma&s;ter of the new grammar-&s;chool, and the &s;ame hath been regularly paid by the king's auditor.

<P>Bi&s;hop Co&s;in's deed of foundation of the alms-hou&s;es on the Place-Green, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;chools there, is to the following effect:</P>
<P>"John, by God's grace and permi&s;&s;ion, bi&s;hop of Durham: To all the faithful &s;ons of Chri&s;t and holy mother church, that may &s;ee or hear the&s;e pre&s;ent letters, or this public in&s;trument, health and ble&s;&s;ing. For as much, as among other works of piety and exerci&s;es of Chri&s;tian religion, which appertain to the office of a bi&s;hop, we were diligently to provide and take care, that our epi&s;copal ca&s;tles, and in them e&s;pecially our chapels, and &s;ome other places and buildings adjoining, de&s;tined for public u&s;es, (all which indeed we found almo&s;t quite de&s;troyed either by the violence of the times, or the neglect and malice of men) might be duly repaired as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and where nece&s;&s;ary rebuilt. Know ye, therefore, that we have not only repaired, and brought into better form, in every part, our fore&s;aid epi&s;copal ca&s;tles, and the &s;acred chapels therein, at our own proper charges, but al&s;o have built anew two &s;chool-hou&s;es, anciently erected by the appointment of the mo&s;t reverend prelate and lord, lord Thomas Langley, our predece&s;&s;or, on the bi&s;hop's palace-green, in

Durham, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid green; (lately almo&s;t fallen and left wa&s;te by the violence of the times and neglect of men) the one of which &s;chools was de&s;igned for in&s;tructing boys in the rudiments of learning, unto the Latin and Greek gram|mar; and the other to in&s;truct boys in the art of writing and plain &s;ongs; with a &s;tipend of 8l. 6s. 8d. annexed, for the ma&s;ter of each &s;chool, to be paid yearly by the king's officers; and with a pen&s;ion in like manner of forty &s;hillings, to be paid by the officers of us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, viz. our auditor and receiver, yearly to the &s;ame ma&s;ter; which we have thought good, as much as in us lies, &s;hould be ratified and confirmed. Know ye, furthermore, that we the bi&s;hop afore&s;aid, have built and placed between the &s;ame &s;chools, another building or alms-hou&s;e, containing in it eight chambers for the entertainment and dwelling of &s;o many poor people, viz. four men and four women. And now for the due maintenance and &s;upport of the &s;ame poor men and women, and the repairs of the hou&s;es afore&s;aid, when &s;uch &s;hall be needful, we make known unto all, that by this our charter, we give and grant an annuity of &s;eventy pounds, to i&s;&s;ue out of the manor or lands of Great-Chilton, in the county of Durham, lately bought with our own proper monies, to be di&s;tributed among the &s;ame poor men and women, and duly to be paid yearly, at four quar|ters of the year, according to an indenture made between us on the one part, and the honourable Charles lord Gerard, baron of Brandon, together with Sir Henage Finch, knight and baronet, the king's &s;olicitor, Sir Gilbert Gerard, knight and baronet, our high-&s;heriff in the county palatine of Durham, Sir Nicholas Cole, of Kepier, in the county of Durham, knight and baronet, and George Davenport, clerk, rector of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham afore&s;aid, our tru&s;tees on the other part; and bearing date the 12th day of Augu&s;t pre&s;ent, as it may appear more fully by the &s;aid indenture. Therefore we will and ordain by this our charter, that the afore&s;aid &s;um of &s;eventy pounds, for the maintenance and &s;upport of eight poor people, living in our ho&s;pital or alms-hou&s;e afore&s;aid, and for the repairs thereof, be di&s;tributed and paid yearly in this manner as followeth.

every third year: Fourthly, that the &s;um of 20s. in like manner be placed in the hands of the &s;aid auditor and receiver, for repairing the &s;aid hou&s;es when it may be needful: Fifthly, that the &s;um of 4l. in like manner, be paid duly at the fea&s;ts afore&s;aid, by equal portions, unto &s;ome hone&s;t woman, to be named by us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, bi&s;hops of Durham, that may daily attend upon the afore&s;aid poor people, in their &s;ickne&s;s and other nece&s;&s;ity: La&s;tly, that the afore&s;aid auditor and receiver re&s;erve in their hands yearly 13s. 4d. to purcha&s;e gloves, as a token for their at|tention and care. Furthermore, we will and ordain, that all &s;uch poor people, be|ing bachelors or widowers and widows, be of hone&s;t repute and good conver&s;ation, and &s;ixty, or at lea&s;t fifty years of age; whereof three men and &s;o many women &s;hall be natives, or at lea&s;t inhabitants of Durham, by the &s;pace of twenty years: But the other two, that is, one man and one woman, &s;hall be cho&s;en out of the vil|lage or pari&s;h of Brancepeth: The cure of which church we anciently had; to be nominated by us during our life, but after our death by our beloved daughters the lady Mary Gerard, the lady Elizabeth Burton, Mrs Frances Gerard, alias Blake&s;ton, and Mrs Anne Greenvile, in their turns after the order of their ages, and by the longer livers and longer liver of them: And after the death of them all, by our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the bi&s;hops of Durham in a full See; but by the dean and chapter of our cathedral church of Durham, in a vacancy, from time to time as often as any place of the &s;aid poor men and women &s;hall happen to be void, for ever. And that this pious and charitable intention of ours may take better effect, we have cho&s;en, named, a&s;&s;igned, and con&s;tituted, and by the&s;e pre&s;ents for us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, do choo&s;e, name, a&s;&s;ign, and con&s;titute our beloved in Chri&s;t, William Unthanke, William Widdrington, Robert Blunt, and Charles Calvert, and our beloved Grace Hutchin|&s;on, Jane Cummin, Eleanor Pear&s;on, and Mary Atkin&s;on, to be the fir&s;t poor men and women of the &s;ame ho&s;pital or alms-hou&s;e, there to remain to be maintained and relieved during their natural lives; unle&s;s in the meanwhile they be removed, or that it &s;hall happen that any one of them be removed thence for &s;ome rea&s;onable cau&s;e, by us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. We will al&s;o, and ordain, that all &s;uch poor people, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hall re&s;ide and lodge in their own chambers. Fur|thermore, we appoint that the poor men and women &s;hall duely &s;ay not only the private prayers a&s;&s;igned to them, by us, in their own chambers; but al&s;o frequent the prayers morning and evening, in the choir of our cathedral church in Durham, unle&s;s they be detained at home by &s;ome real &s;ickne&s;s: That they all go to church, two by two, both men and women, in their gowns, mode&s;tly, decently, and in or|der: That they &s;hall &s;it next after the king's bead&s;men, &s;ounded in the &s;ame cathe|dral church; and there demean them&s;elves humbly and devoutly.

<HEAD>THE COUNTY COURT.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;heriff is judge of the county court, and all proceedings there are before him; and yet the office of county clerk hath, time out of mind, been granted by the bi&s;hop by patent for life, and &s;uch patentee i&s;&s;ues all proce&s;&s;es, and all pleadings are in his office, and he receives to his own u&s;e all the profits thereof. And where the debts and damages are above 13s. 4d. the proce&s;s is capias I ob&s;erve in &s;ome rea&s;ons offered again&s;t taking away the county palatine, it is mentioned, that in 1665, there was &s;ome attempt to di&s;courage the practice of arre&s;ting by capias; and that the grand jury made a repre&s;entation in writing to the judges at the a&s;&s;izes, of the great conveniencies ari&s;ing to the county by it, and that the &s;ame was al&s;o &s;igned by the mayor and aldermen, and the attornies, and publicly read at the a&s;&s;izes; and that the &s;aid cu&s;tom of i&s;&s;uing capias was approved and allowed by the judges. And in 1666, at the a&s;&s;izes of Durham, one <HI>Potter</HI> being in gaol upon a capias, i&s;&s;ued out of the county court, moved by Mr Stot, for a habeas corpus to bring the defendant to the bar; and the &s;heriff in his return &s;et forth the cu&s;tom of arre&s;ting by capias, and the defendant was brought to the bar, and the matter argued by councel; the councel for the defendant at the bar agreed the cu&s;tom was good and the defendant was remanded. There was al&s;o a writ of fal&s;e judgment brought by <HI>Dale</HI> at &s;uit of <HI>Hall,</HI> and the awarding of a capias was a&s;&s;igned for error. Sir T. Tur&s;den, upon hearing coun|cel on both &s;ides, took time to con&s;ider of the error, and afterwards declared, he had con&s;ulted with his brethren, the judges, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, who were of opinion, that the cu&s;tom being in the county palatine by pre&s;cription might be good, and gave orders for affirming the judgment. In the year 1668, three writs of fal&s;e judgment were brought by <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> again&s;t <HI>Huntley,</HI> and the awarding the capias again a&s;&s;igned for error; after argument before baron Rainsford, he was attended again at Newca&s;tle, and appointed the &s;ame to be further argued at his chambers in Serjeant's Inn, when he &s;aid he had con&s;ulted his brethren, who were of opinion the cu&s;tom was good, and affirmed the judgment; and ordered Mr Cooke, the a&s;&s;ociate, to draw a &s;pecial rule, and &s;et out the cu&s;tom, which was done.</P>
<P>In the auditor's office is the petition, called a repre&s;entation of the grand jury, dated the 20th of April, 1664.</P>
<BIBL>Rudd's MSS.</BIBL>
<P>The office or place of county clerk hath, time out of mind, been di&s;appendant as to the high &s;heriff's office, who has never received any profit of the &s;aid court, though he hath always exerci&s;ed and enjoyed the office of judge of and within that court; and that all pleadings within that court have been held before the &s;heriff, and not otherwi&s;e. The &s;aid court hath, time out of mind, had the lawful and unque&s;tioned juri&s;diction, in all ca&s;es therein to award a capias upon a ju&s;ticies, directed to the &s;heriff, and no other per&s;on whatever, which is done at a &s;mall charge. Carthew, 207. Comb. 260.</P>
<P>The court commonly called the county court, in fact is a court holden before the &s;heriff of the county, and &s;o it is &s;tiled in writs of fal&s;e judgment; which di&s;tingui&s;hes this court from all other county courts properly &s;o called, and of which the &s;uitors are judges, and they are &s;aid to be holden <HI>coram &s;ectatoribus.</HI> See I.

<P><Q>Though it be &s;aid commonly, that the &s;uitors are judges, yet by pre&s;cription the &s;heriff may be judge.&mdash; There is a court called the court of the county in the county palatine of Durham, and the &s;heriff is judge; and though in the county court the &s;uitors are judges, yet by pre&s;cription it may be held before the &s;heriff.</Q> 2 and 3 Edw.

<P>Before we proceed in the de&s;cription of the pre&s;ent edifice, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome few ob&s;ervations on the form and con&s;truction of fortre&s;&s;es of the like date. We remarked, that it was probable there was a place of &s;trength and defence on the ca&s;tle hill, before the Conqueror, returning from his Scotch expedition, thought it expe|dient in this province, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and natural a barrier again&s;t the more northern powers, to erect a ca&s;tle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide note vol. i. p. 113.</NOTE>.

Towers of an octagonal form, we conceive, were not uncommon with the Normans; yet we do not apprehend the pre&s;ent tower was of Norman architecture: The lofty mount mo&s;t probably attracted the founder's attention: But we have met with very little evidence to &s;upport &s;uch a po&s;ition.

<Q>The materials of which ca&s;tles were built, varied, according to the places of their erection; but the manner of their con&s;truction &s;eems to have been pretty uni|form. The out&s;ides of the walls were generally built with the &s;tones neare&s;t at hand, laid as regularly as their &s;hapes would admit; the in&s;ides were filled with the like materials, mixed with a great quantity of fluid mortar, which was called by the workmen grout-work: A very ancient method of building u&s;ed by the Romans, and quoted by Palladio, and all the writers on architecture. The angles were always coigned, and the arches turned with &s;quared &s;tone, brought from Caen, in Normandy, with which the whole out&s;ide was now and then ea&s;ed. Sometimes in&s;tead of &s;tone the in&s;ides of the walls were formed with &s;quared chalk, as is the ca&s;tle of Guildford. When the Normans found the ruins of an ancient building on the &s;cite of their intended &s;tructure, they either endeavoured to incor|porate it into their work, or made u&s;e of the materials; as may be &s;een by many buildings of known Norman con&s;truction, wherein are fragments of Saxon archi|tecture, or large quantities of Roman bricks, which has cau&s;ed them often to be mi&s;taken for Roman or Saxon edifices. The general &s;hape or plan of the&s;e ca&s;tles depended entirely on the caprice of the architects, or the form of the ground intended to be occupied; neither do they &s;eem to have confined them&s;elves to any particular figure in their towers, &s;quare, round, and poligonal, oftentimes occur|ing in the original parts of the &s;ame building. The &s;ituations commonly cho&s;en were &s;teep rocks, cliffs, eminences, or the banks of rivers.</Q> To this ob&s;ervation we mu&s;t add, that the fortifications on the ground now under con&s;ideration, occupied or enclo&s;ed the whole &s;ummit of the hill; the outward wall running along the very brink of the eminence, and forming an oval figure; at the northern extremity of which the ca&s;tle &s;tands, on the neck of land, where the ground de&s;cends &s;wiftly to the lower town, called the borough; the river runs almo&s;t round the whole walled or fortified eminence, except at that part where Claypath or Cluerport gate &s;tands; at which point, the ea&s;tern or we&s;tern channels drawing neare&s;t together, give the walled or fortified part of the town the figure of a hor&s;e &s;hoe, &s;o that the river to tho&s;e fortifications &s;erved in lieu of a moat: The natural a&s;cent from the river to the foot of &s;ome parts of the city wall, is upwards of eighty perpendicular feet. <Q>In towns (Mr Gro&s;e &s;ays, p. 9) the appellation of <HI>ballium</HI> was given to any work fenced with pali&s;ades, and &s;ome times ma&s;onry, covering the &s;uburbs; but in ca&s;tles
<PB N="281" REF="295">
was the &s;pace immediately within the outer wall. When there was a double enceinte of walls, the areas next each wall were &s;tiled the outer and inner ballia. The manner in which the&s;e are mentioned in the &s;iege of Bedford ca&s;tle, &s;uf|ficiently ju&s;tify this po&s;ition: <HI>The ca&s;tle was taken by four a&s;&s;aults; in the fir&s;t was taken the barbican, in the &s;econd the outer ballia, at the third attack the wall by the old tower was thrown down by the miners, where, with great danger they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the inner ballia, through a chink; at the fourth a&s;&s;ault the miners &s;et fire to the tower, &s;o that the &s;moke bur&s;t out, and the tower it&s;elf was cloven to that degree, as to &s;hew vi&s;ibly &s;ome broad chinks, whereupon the enemy &s;urrendered.</HI>&mdash; This receives further confirmation from the enumeration of the lands belonging to Colche&s;ter ca&s;tle, wherein are &s;pecified "the upper bailey, in which the ca&s;tle &s;tands, and the nether bailey, &amp;c." The wall of the ballium in ca&s;tles was com|monly high, flanked with towers, and had a parapet, embattled, crenellated, or garretted for the mounting of it. There were flights of &s;teps at convenient di&s;|tances; and the parapet often had the merlons pierced with long chinks, ending in round holes, called oillets.</Q> Whether, at Durham, there was an inner and outer ballium, is uncertain; the two &s;treets now called the Baileys, are &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the high and low Bailey, and north and &s;outh Bailey, and prompt an idea, that &s;uch might be the original form of the fortification; but when the pre&s;ent cathedral church was built, the di&s;tinction and interior wall per|haps was removed, as no remains thereof now appear.</P>
<P>Within the ballium were lodgings or barracks, for tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ervice it was to defend the ca&s;tle per&s;onally, either as principals or &s;ub&s;titutes; &s;o in the Baileys the hou&s;es were anciently held in capite by the &s;ervice of ca&s;tle ward, and many chief per&s;onages had tenements therein for greater &s;ecurity in times of public danger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The families of Alen&s;helys, and de Le Ley.

Henry Egerton, one of the pre&s;ent prebendaries of Durham, having purcha&s;ed the adjacent grounds, widened the &s;treet, and promoted the building of a &s;pacious arch, of Roman architecture, without gates, in the place of the old gateway: This would have proved little more than an ornament to the city, had not the dean and chapter, with a munificence which di&s;tingui&s;hes that wor&s;hipful body in all their public works, laid it open for the u&s;e of gentlemen's families; who&s;e carriages only are permitted to pa&s;s along the elegant new bridge, lately erected by them: A bounty re&s;erved to this age.</P>
<P>At this gate the ancient wall of the ballium appears, &s;tretching along the brink of the hill towards the church of St Mary-le-Bow, where King's-gate anciently &s;tood.

<P>In the fir&s;t volume, page 113, we offered &s;ome conjectures relative to the ca&s;tle: It is pretty well e&s;tabli&s;hed that William the Conqueror ordered a fortre&s;s to be erected here; and it is probable, the works which then defended the mount, attract|ed the attention of the Norman; whether tho&s;e works merited the name of a ca&s;tle is not ea&s;y to determine, or what they really were; though from the mode of the Saxons, we may pre&s;ume they con&s;i&s;ted of brea&s;t works or circumvallations, of which the pre&s;ent terraces may be &s;ome remains.

When Framwellgate bridge was built by bi&s;hop Flambard, in the opening of the twelfth century, he carried on a &s;trong wall between the ca&s;tle and the church; and it is probable he built the la&s;t mentioned towers to command the pa&s;s: The bridge had al&s;o a &s;trong gateway and tower: Building this bridge nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned a pa&s;&s;age to be made from thence into the borough; and on that account, bi&s;hop Flambard &s;trengthened that &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, between the bridge and the north gate before &s;poken of, with a moat; which, from the example before given, was undoubtedly for|tified with round towers or ba&s;tions. <Q>The method of attack and defence of fortified places practi&s;ed by our ance&s;tors before, and even &s;ome time after the invention of gunpowder, was much after the manner of the Romans; mo&s;t of the &s;ame ma|chines being made u&s;e of, though &s;ome of them under different names: They had their engines for throwing &s;tones and darts of different weights and &s;izes: For ap|proaching the walls they had moveable towers <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gro&s;e's Antiq. vol. i. 2d ed. p. 14 and 17.</NOTE>.</Q> So that the more lofty the forti|fication, con&s;equently it was more difficult of a&s;&s;ault by the machines u&s;ed in &s;ieges.

<P>Many of the keeps or dungeons, in the ancient ca&s;tles, are placed in the &s;ame &s;ituation of the ballium, as the ca&s;tle of Durham, as Conni&s;borough ca&s;tle, Tick|hill, Portche&s;ter, Cambridge, Oxford, Tunbridge, and &s;everal others. The mount on which Durham tower &s;tands is near forty-four perpendicular feet in height, from the level of the Place-Green, to the foot of the building, and it appears to
<PB N="285" REF="299">
have been forced from the level; to the above eminence add the natural height of the whole hill from the level of the river, and it will be upwards of one hundred and thirty perpendicular feet. It is the opinion of a &s;kilful architect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Geo. Nichol&s;on, who is director of the repairs now making at the cathedral.</NOTE>, that the foundation of this tower goes down to the rock; and by the falling in of &s;ome arches, we di&s;cover that the whole erection is vaulted underneath; but as tho&s;e vaults, from their apparent depth, do not occupy above a fourth part of the height of the mount, we are left to conjecture in what manner the re&s;t of the eminence was forced or &s;upported: It is apprehended, that after the Norman tower was built, the mount did not remain cut out into terraces agreeable to the pre&s;ent form, but that the &s;ides were regularly &s;loped from the building to the plain, to render it as difficult to be climbed as po&s;&s;ible, forming a regular glacis or talus round the tower; and that the approach to the gate of the tower was by a long &s;light of &s;teps, from the inner court, &s;o narrow that two per&s;ons only could pa&s;s at a time; and &s;o open on each &s;ide that an a&s;&s;ailant oppo&s;ed might be tumbled headlong to the bottom. Mr King, de&s;cribing Coning&s;borough ca&s;tle in the 6th volume of the Archaeologia, &s;ays, <Q>The fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes the eye is a very remarkable &s;loping part of the foundation walls, ri&s;ing to a great height like a mount, and having in many parts, in con&s;equence of its being covered with earth and mo&s;s, the appearance of a &s;mall hill exactly of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions as the ca&s;tle it&s;elf; the bottom of this &s;loping part appears almo&s;t circular, but higher up are &s;een more fully, &s;ix va&s;t projecting buttre&s;&s;es, a&s;cending in a &s;till more &s;teep direction, to prop and &s;up|port the building. Immediately above this &s;loping part the tower ri&s;es perpendi|cularly to a great height: Its in&s;ide forms a compleat circle; but on the out&s;ide appear &s;ix additional &s;quare turrets, which are, however, merely the continuation upwards of the buttre&s;&s;es ju&s;t mentioned.</Q> Before the pre&s;ent terraces of our tower were formed, perhaps the ribs of the foundation appeared &s;upporting the but|tre&s;&s;es of each angle; and by &s;uch a ba&s;e, mining, which was much practi&s;ed in an|tiquity, would be impeded or rendered impracticable: The tower of Coning&s;borough ca&s;tle forms an hexagon; Durham tower an ill-formed octagon of irregular &s;ides; &s;ome of the fronts exceeding others in breadth &s;everal feet; the angles are &s;upport|ed by buttre&s;&s;es, and a parapet has run round the &s;ummit of the whole building, with a brea&s;t wall and embrazure: The diameter of this tower in the wide&s;t part is &s;ixty-three feet &s;ix inches, and in the narrowe&s;t &s;ixty-one feet: It has contained four &s;tories or tiers of apartments, exclu&s;ive of the vaults: The great entrance is on the we&s;t &s;ide: There is nothing now left of this edifice but the mount, vaults, and out&s;ide &s;hell; which latter, from its noble appearance, and the great ornament

At pre&s;ent the mount, as we ob&s;erved before, is formed into terraces, as well for ornament as recreation: The uppermo&s;t terrace is ten feet wide, and laid with gravel, command|ing a pro&s;pect not only of the whole city and its beautiful environs, but al&s;o an ex|ten&s;ive view of the country as far as Gate&s;head-fell, Pen&s;haw, Newbottle, Warden Law, and Quarrington, with the nearer objects, Newton-hall, Pittington, Sherburn, Aykley-heads, and other places of note: Between this and the lower terrace is a gra&s;s &s;lope, &s;upported by a brea&s;t wall, and you de&s;cend by twenty-three &s;teps; the &s;econd terrace is of equal breadth with the other, and laid with gravel, and is in like manner &s;eparated from the lowe&s;t terrace by a gra&s;s &s;lope and brea&s;t wall, to which you de&s;cend by twenty-one &s;teps; this terrace is of like width and form as the others, and is twenty-two &s;teps above the level of the garden below.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, who acceded to the bi&s;hopric in 1153, re&s;tored &s;ome part of the ca&s;tle, which had &s;uffered by fire.

Bi&s;hop Fox found it too expen&s;ive to keep this &s;pacious hall in repair, or it was too large for his nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es, and therefore he reduced it con&s;iderably; he took away the &s;eat at the &s;outh end, and converted that part into a kitchen and &s;teward's apartments, &s;o that it was le&s;&s;ened at lea&s;t one-third of its original &s;ize; yet there remained room enough for the entertain|ment of the prince&s;s Margaret, and her attendants, in her way to Scotland; on that occa&s;ion, we read, that all the nobility and people of di&s;tinction of the northern parts, as well &s;pirituals as temporals, were pre&s;ent, and the &s;ervices con&s;i&s;ted of that gorgeous di&s;play of provi&s;ions, called by the writers of that time <HI>double dinners.</HI> This prelate began to repair the great tower, and built a hall, kitchen, and &s;ome other apartments therein, but before his plan was far advanced, he was tran&s;lated, and no further progre&s;s was made in that work: We &s;ee his arms in the partition wall of the great hall. Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall made great repairs to the ca&s;tle, he built the pre&s;ent gateway and tower, and flanked it with a &s;trong wall on either hand: He brought water to the palace in pipes, it being &s;upplied before by wells and re&s;er|voirs; he erected the pre&s;ent gallery, and made a new approach to the apartments there; he al&s;o built a beautiful little chapel, which has received improvements from &s;ucceeding prelates, as the arms of Co&s;in and Talbot placed therein denote. We &s;hould not omit to remark in this place, that on the facing of the entrance into the &s;talls, at the we&s;t end, is a &s;triking mark of Wol&s;ey's arrogance; on the oak are carved the cardinal's arms, taking the dexter &s;ide again&s;t the arms of his principality and See of Durham. Bi&s;hop Barnes and Neile made great repairs: The latter en|larged the windows, and thereby gave the apartments a new degree of elegance.</P>
<P>The great tower became an object of incumbrance &s;oon after the Reformation; and at length, in bi&s;hop Morton's time, it was one of tho&s;e erections for which the bi&s;hops were decreed to be di&s;charged from future dilapidations, &s;o that nothing but the love of ornament, and the &s;olemn grace it added to the a&s;pect of the ca&s;tle in particular, and to this beautiful city in general, has &s;ince that period for a cen|tury and a half &s;aved it from utter demolition and ruin.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Morton had the honour of a royal vi&s;it at his ca&s;tle of Durham, and then di&s;played the ancient ho&s;pitality and magnificence of the prelates of this See; he entertained king Charles I. and all his retinue in the hall of this palace, when he

made his tour into Scotland, expending, as it is &s;aid, no le&s;s a &s;um than fifteen hundred pounds a day on the occa&s;ion. Bi&s;hop Co&s;in, who&s;e memory is dear to tho&s;e that venerate the ancient &s;eats of our prelates, put the ca&s;tle of Durham into repair, made a new entrance into the hall, renewed the fountain, added many apart|ments, and gave much ornament to the exterior parts; he again reduced the hall, by taking off an audience room at the north end, at the foot of the great &s;tairca&s;e; and put a &s;creen of wain&s;cot at the &s;outh end, to conceal the pa&s;&s;ages to the kitchen and offices; he al&s;o wain&s;cotted the hall round about. In its pre&s;ent &s;tate the hall is one hundred and eighty feet in length, thirty-&s;ix feet in width, and about fifty feet in height to the rafters; is lighted by three large windows to the we&s;t, and two to the ea&s;t. Since bi&s;hop Co&s;in's time, &s;ucceeding prelates have made improve|ments, which, as well as the work of more remote ages, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the arms placed on various parts of the building. Bi&s;hop Trevor did a great deal, particularly to the north front, which opens upon a terrace eighty paces long above the moat, terminated by the round tower before &s;poken of: He improved many of the apartments by putting in chimney-pieces of &s;tone-work, highly wrought in the Gothic &s;tile, and well adapted to the figure of the rooms, making very large &s;a&s;h windows in the &s;ame order, and &s;tuccoing the walls and ceilings, in which work he employed the able&s;t ma&s;ters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We have not been able to collect from the records before us what number or complement of men form|ed the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of this ca&s;tle.

<HEAD>The Pari&s;h of St Nicholas, in Durham.</HEAD>
<P>From the Gaol-gates to the Market-place, you pa&s;s down Sadler-&s;treet, having Elvet-bridge on the right-hand. This &s;treet, or &s;ome con&s;iderable part of it, was anciently called the Fle&s;hewer-raw, and is &s;till occupied by butchers. We are led to lament that want of police in the city which &s;hould correct the brutal &s;pectacle of &s;laughtering animals in the &s;treet; &s;hocking to travellers, who in&s;tantly turn a&s;ide with di&s;gu&s;t, and pa&s;s to other places, not only with prejudice of mind again&s;t the whole place, but with cen&s;ures on its inhabitants: They look back on the magnificent buildings, and whil&s;t they recollect the royal rights of the powerful prelate, the learned body of men who &s;it in the chapter-hou&s;e, the re-infranchi&s;ed body corporate of the city, and the opulent and polite inhabitants in general, they exclaim, <Q>In this &s;eat of learning, the epi&s;copal capital, and center of the provin|cial law, hitherto common decency has not drawn a &s;kreen before the execution of the &s;laughtering knife that &s;erves their luxury.</Q></P>
<P>Elvet bridge was built by bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, who al&s;o re&s;tored the borough of Elvet, after the de&s;truction made by Cumin's followers. <Q>As Framwel-gate bridge, built by bi&s;hop Flambard, was called the Old bridge, &s;o Elvet bridge, built by Hugh Pu&s;ar, or Pud&s;ey, was called the New bridge. There were on it formerly two chapels, one dedicated to St James, built by Lewinus Burgen&s;is in the reign of king Henry III. and &s;ince converted to a pri&s;on for the hou&s;e of correction: The other, dedicated to St Andrew <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapel was built upon two pillars nearer Elvet, and is at pre&s;ent a black&s;mith's &s;hop, but a charity &s;chool is kept in the chancel, the old walls &s;till remaining. <BIBL>Randal's MSS.</BIBL></NOTE>, founded by William, &s;on of Ab&s;olam, Ro|bert de In&s;ula, bi&s;hop, Edw.

<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;quare is the Town-hall, with commodious apartments for public fe&s;tivals and other u&s;es, lately rebuilt on a modern plan. The old hall was erected and given to the city by bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal, ornamented with a large cupola in the center, and in other re&s;pects exhibiting the elegance which was introduced to the&s;e northern parts in that prelate's age: Whether before bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal's time there was a <HI>Common-hall</HI> for the burge&s;&s;es, is not well a&s;certained; but there
<PB N="295" REF="309">
was a <HI>Toll-booth</HI> in the middle of the &s;quare, as in other ancient places for the weights and mea&s;ures: As Chambr&egrave; tells us, <Q>A beautiful marble cro&s;s which &s;tood in the upper part of the &s;treet of Gilly-gate, in a place there called the Maid's-harbour, was given to William Wright, of Durham, merchant, at his petition, by Ma&s;ter Orm&s;trang Scot, lord of Keepyere, to be &s;et up in Durham market-place.

<P>The church is very plain and meanly built, being con&s;tructed of &s;mall and peri&s;hable &s;tones, &s;o that from frequent pointing it is now almo&s;t covered with mortar. It varies greatly from the &s;ituation of other churches, evidently to &s;uit the ground whereon it &s;tands, which &s;erves to &s;upport the opinion we before gave, that anciently, by a &s;luice, the city was here occa&s;ionally in&s;ulated, by bringing in the &s;treams of the Were. The north wall is very &s;trong and lofty, &s;upported by &s;quare buttre&s;&s;es, or rather ba&s;tions. This church hath two &s;ide ailes, that to the north running the whole length of the building; the &s;outh aile is &s;hortened by the tower &s;tanding on the &s;outh-we&s;t angle. The nave and two &s;ide ailes are twenty paces in width, and to the chancel the nave is twenty-&s;ix paces in length: The &s;outh aile is formed by one &s;mall octagonal column of con&s;iderable height, &s;upporting blunt pointed arches: The north aile hath two &s;hort octagonal columns, with wide and lofty blunt pointed arches, ri&s;ing from brackets at the extremities. The chancel opens with a pointed arch in the center, to the &s;outh a &s;mall column with a pointed arch, to the
<PB N="296" REF="310">
north a &s;hort round column, and irregular circular arches: The chancel is in length &s;ix paces to the &s;teps, and the rece&s;s for the altar is &s;ix paces wide. At the opening of the chancel are the &s;eats for the mercers company and body corporate, neatly fitted up. The roof of the north aile is &s;upported by three half-arches, ri&s;ing from octagonal brackets. The gates have circular arches: The &s;outh windows are modern and &s;a&s;hed; the north windows irregular, and &s;ome under pointed arches. This fabric hath been con&s;tructed at various times; the north aile bears marks of remote antiquity; but no records afford us further light therein, than that we find Galfrid de Elimer rector in 1133; though by the mode of architecture we &s;hould be led to give this church a cotemporary date with the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Saxons at Durham.</P>

<P><PB N="304" REF="318">The traveller who is conducted to this church, &s;hould be admitted at the north door, and depart from the &s;outh door, where a noble pro&s;pect opens to the view, too exten&s;ive for a picture, and too rich for de&s;cription. The inadequate ideas which language can convey, are to be lamented by the reader who has a ta&s;te for rural beauties, and the elegance of land&s;cape. The church of St Giles &s;tands upon very elevated ground, open to the &s;outh where the view is unob&s;tructed. In front the meadow grounds form a &s;teep de&s;cent to the river; on one wing clo&s;ed by the wood called Pelaw Wood, on the other by the buildings of the &s;treet. At the foot of the hill the river Were forms a beautiful canal, almo&s;t a mile in length, termi|nated by Elvet bridge to the right, and by the wooded inclo&s;ures of Old Durham on the left. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore is the race ground, con&s;i&s;ting of an extended tract of level meads, from whence, by a gradual a&s;cent, ri&s;e the two Elvets; the &s;treet of Old Elvet running parallel, the other obliquely, bordered with gardens, and terminated by Elvet church; a hand&s;ome &s;tructure. The channel of the river lying between New Elvet and the Bailies, affords an agreeable break or change in the objects; the &s;loping gardens being &s;een over the buildings of Elvet, &s;oftened to the eye with that plea&s;ing teint which the di&s;tance produces. On the brink of the a&s;cent &s;tand the Bailies, object ri&s;ing gradually above object, guarded with the remains of the town wall, and crowned with the cathedral church, which in this view pre&s;ents the north and ea&s;t fronts, like the mitre which binds the temples of its pre|late; giving the noble&s;t &s;upreme ornament to the capital of the principality. To the right Elvet bridge, with &s;even arches, receives the &s;tream, and intercepts a fur|ther view of the progre&s;s of the river: Over it, tier above tier, ri&s;e the buildings of Sadler-&s;treet, the gloomy and &s;olemn towers of the gaol, and the battlement and octagonal tower of the ca&s;tle; the trophies of civil juri&s;diction wearing the a&s;pect of old &s;ecular authority, and the frowns of feudal power. Between the chief objects, the cathedral and ca&s;tle, on the nearer back ground, South-&s;treet, with its hanging gardens, makes a fine curvature; behind which Brandon Mount, with a &s;pit of high land extending towards Auckland, form the horizon. Further to the right,
<PB N="305" REF="319">
from the banks of the river, ri&s;e the buildings of the Market-place, crouding the tower of the church, from whence the &s;treets of Claypeth and Gillygate extend. Thus far de&s;cription has proceeded without much faultering, but in the other di|vi&s;ions of the &s;cene it is faint and totally inadequate: Whoever would know the re&s;t mu&s;t come and view it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the view placed as a head-piece to the fir&s;t page of this volume.</NOTE>. Over the meadows, in the center, a precipice ri&s;es near one hundred perpendicular feet in height, called MAIDEN CASTLE, fear, or cliff; the &s;teep &s;ides of the hill to the right and left are covered with a fore&s;t of old oaks, and the foot of the cliff is wa&s;hed by the river, who&s;e &s;tream appears again at this point. The lofty ridge of hills cloathed with oaks, &s;tretching away, forms a ziz-zag figure; at the mo&s;t di&s;tant point of which, the great &s;outhern road, up the new inclo&s;ed grounds of Elvet moor, is &s;een climbing the hill, for near a mile, be|yond which very di&s;tant eminences form a blue-tinged horizon. To the left of Maiden ca&s;tle cliff you look upon a rich valley, highly cultivated, extending nearly five miles in length and two in width, bending to the &s;outh-we&s;t, through which the river winds its &s;ilver &s;tream, in the figure of an S: Hanging woods &s;hut in each &s;ide of the nearer vale, where are finely di&s;po&s;ed, the plea&s;ant village of <HI>Shincliff,</HI> the bridge of three arches, the villa of William Rudd, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Hough-hall hou&s;e:</HI> The extreme part of the valley is clo&s;ed by the woods of Shincliff, <HI>Butterby,</HI> and <HI>Croxdale,</HI> forming an elegant amphitheatre; over the&s;e ri&s;e di&s;tant hills, lined out with inclo&s;ures, giving the yellow and brown teint to the land&s;cape over the richer coloured woods. The whole fini&s;hed with an elevated horizon, on the wings of which are &s;cattered the villages of <HI>Ferryhill</HI> and <HI>Merrington;</HI> the tower of Mer|rington church forming a beautiful and lofty obeli&s;k. One of the greate&s;t excel|lencies of this land&s;cape is, that the ground ri&s;es gradually before you, and ju&s;t &s;uch a di&s;tance is maintained as pre&s;erves all the objects di&s;tinct; not like the land&s;capes painted by the Flemi&s;h and Dutch ma&s;ters. To the left you look down upon <HI>Old Durham hou&s;e,</HI> its terraces and hanging gardens, with a fine bend of cul|tivated country &s;tretching away through another opening of the hills towards the ea&s;t, bounded by the high grounds of Quarrington, and the cliffs of Coxhoe Lime|kilns; more ru&s;tic than the other views, and being in a &s;impler nature, affords a plea&s;ing variety to the eye of the man of ta&s;te, who &s;tands (if we may be allowed the extravagant expre&s;&s;ion) <HI>on this enchanted ground</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr Doubleday's hou&s;e, which is covered with lead, commands from the roof the whole of this pro&s;pect, with a wide, though much le&s;s beautiful, view to the northward.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Old Durham hou&s;e</HI> is gone to decay, nothing now remaining but apartments for a farmer: It was anciently the &s;eat of the Booths, afterwards of the Cockburns, lords of Orm&s;ton, and in more modern times became the e&s;tate of the Tempe&s;ts, to which latter family it pa&s;&s;ed by intermarriage with the heire&s;s of the Heaths. The gardens are formed into terraces of a con&s;iderable length. This &s;weet retirement is become a place of public re&s;ort, where concerts of mu&s;ic have frequently been performed in the &s;ummer evenings, and the company regaled with fruit, tea, &amp;c. The gardens are open all &s;ummer for rural recreation. The terraces command the elegant valley pro&s;pect before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="320">At the corner of the garden &s;ome few years ago were the remains of a very an|cient building, with a circular window, and other appearances of the chapel form. When the Scots burnt the ho&s;pital of Sherburn, it is probable they de&s;troyed the camera here. Of Poulton, Grainge, Ram&s;ide, and Ravensflat, mentioned in the book of rates to lie in this pari&s;h, there is nothing remarkable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From a pamphlet intitled "A brief View of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, &amp;c." addre&s;&s;ed to Nathaniel Curzon, bart. and the re&s;t of the committee appointed by parliament for inquiring into the abu&s;es and cor|ruptions of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts and juri&s;dictions. London, printed for J. Peele. 1733.</P>
<P><Q>I have now by me a mo&s;t moving and lamentable account, contained in about &s;ixty letters, &s;ent me by Mr J. Tempe&s;t, of Old Durham, formerly a member of your hou&s;e, complaining of the mo&s;t barbarous and ty|rannic proceedings of the &s;piritual and temporal courts there again&s;t his per&s;on, e&s;tate, and property, that ever was known to have been practi&s;ed in any court of law or ju&s;tice whatever. And this, as he &s;ays, chiefly promoted and carried on by a confederacy between the bi&s;hop's chancellor and &s;heriff, who, by their under officers and agents, have illegally &s;eized upon whatever of his property they can lay their hands on, on pretence of an outlawry or excommunication, of which he had no notice till the &s;eizure was actually made: And that upon application to his &s;overeign, the bi&s;hop, for redre&s;s, he has been denied all manner of relief; and therefore intreats me to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to you the parliament's committee, which I am now preparing to that end.

It is conjectured, when the bi&s;hop erected <HI>a new free borough</HI> for merchants in Elvet, the di&s;tinctions of <HI>the borough of Elvet,</HI> and <HI>the old borough of Durham</HI> fir&s;t aro&s;e. Was there not much evidence to &s;hew, there were di&s;tinct places called the old and new borough, out of the bounds of the city, and in the limits of St O&s;wald's pari&s;h, we &s;hould not have in&s;i&s;ted on the po&s;ition &s;o po&s;itively. When the <HI>old borough of Durham</HI> had its ri&s;e, from whence, or what were its privileges, we remain ignorant; but the evidence we &s;hall produce leads us to judge <HI>the old borough of Durham</HI> comprehended the whole pari&s;h of St O&s;wald, &s;ub&s;tracted from Croxdale, and that on the in&s;titution of <HI>the borough of Elvet,</HI> limits and bounds were &s;et to the new borough, and the re&s;t remained to the old borough; admitting this conjecture, it will follow, that the old borough comprehended Cro&s;&s;gate, South-&s;treet, &amp;c. now St Margaret's cha|pelry, and in fact circum&s;cribed the new borough, It is not material to pre&s;s this &s;ubject further than to &s;upport our fir&s;t po&s;ition, that Old Durham, and the old borough of Durham, were the fir&s;t &s;ettlements of the Saxons here, before they built their church on the &s;ummit of the hill; and from thence tho&s;e places derived their pre&s;ent name.</P>
<P>On the cliff before de&s;cribed, in the view from Gillygate church, is the platform now called <HI>Maiden Ca&s;tle</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr J. Cade, of Durham, in a tract publi&s;hed in the 7th vol. of the Archaeologia, p. 75, has mentioned this place, and &s;ome works at Old Durham, extracts from which are placed here, that the reader, and particular|ly the traveller, may judge for him&s;elf on the &s;ubject. <Q>In the fir&s;t place then, I would ob&s;erve, that there are &s;everal camps or &s;tations in this county, which were undoubtedly of Roman original; but being &s;ub&s;e|quently occupied by different tribes of adventurers, and altered according to their re&s;pective modes of de|fence, this circum&s;tance has cau&s;ed their primary occupancy to be overlooked by antiquaries. I &s;hall men|tion particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Mainforth</HI> and <HI>Maiden ca&s;tle,</HI> (now Old Durham) &amp;c. The latter is the property of J. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpe&s;t, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and lies within half a mile of this city, mea&s;uring, according to Dr Stukeley's account, about
<PB N="309" REF="323">five hundred feet in length, &amp;c. Our camp at Maiden Ca&s;tle I &s;uppo&s;e may have derived its name from the Briti&s;h word <HI>mad</HI> pulcher or fair, which the Rev. Mr Pegge thus ingeniou&s;ly explains, in treating of the maiden way or maiden ca&s;tle, in the county of We&s;tmerland, and which term is particularly applicable to the delightful &s;ituation of Old Durham. It al&s;o has a better claim to be con&s;idered as the Condurcum of the Romans, from which it is about two miles di&s;tant, than the camp near Sunderland bridge, (which is evidently of Dani&s;h con&s;truction) and which the annotator upon Camden &s;ays, was the opinion of a very great antiquary. I may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, with the learned Mr Whitaker and others, that the Romans had generally a &s;ummer and a winter &s;tation, &s;ituated within a few miles of each other, and often on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the &s;ame river; which entirely coincides with the &s;ituation of Che&s;ter and this camp; the former might be the &s;ummer &s;tation, and this the winter. In Hollin&s;hed's Chronicle, fir&s;t edition, p. 225, we have an account of a memorable &s;iege which this place &s;u&s;tained in favour of king Athel&s;tan, again&s;t an army of Scots and Danes, commanded by Godfrey brother to Anlaf, and &s;on to Sithric, the Dani&s;h king of the Northumbrians, about the year 930, under the title Dure&s;me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dure&s;me appears to have been a name introduced by the Normans, on account of the fortre&s;s built here after the Con|que&s;t, to keep the natives in &s;ubjection.</NOTE>, though the foundations of the pre&s;ent city were not laid till &s;ixty years afterwards; and Marianus mentions a &s;ynod being held at Dunelhoo, A^o 822. This &s;tation, I imagine, was formerly thought of great con&s;equence, but it at length &s;uffered the rate of many others in the northern parts, when William the Conqueror made that horrid deva&s;tation between York and this place, and erected his ca&s;trum in the new city<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A melancholy in&s;tance of this depopulation, among&s;t many others, is to be met with at Acley, (or Acliff) in this coun|ty, which may probably derive its name from Acca, bi&s;hop of Hagu&s;tald, in the beginning of the eighth century, and where Sir Henry Spelman mentions two Saxon councils having been held, annis 782 and 789. About a mile from the afore&s;aid village, after the gra&s;s is cut, the foundations of a con&s;iderable town, with a large church in form of a cro&s;s, are very con|&s;picuous.</NOTE>; the fortifications were then partly level|led, but enough is left to point out its former magnitude and importance; it being, in my opinion, much larger than Dr Stukeley <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">His de&s;cription is as follows; Iter Boreale, p. 70. <Q>Ea&s;tward, over the river Were, upon another penin&s;ula of high ground, I &s;aw a camp, called Maiden Ca&s;tle, which I judge to be Roman. It is almo&s;t incompa&s;&s;ed too by a rivulet fall|ing into the river from the ea&s;t. It is of an oblong form, five hundred feet long, very &s;teep on three &s;ides; the neck is guarded by a rampart, and without that, at &s;ome little di&s;tance by a ditch.

A gentleman, with whom I am acquaint|ed, has carefully &s;urveyed the old road from this place by Kepyer ho&s;pital, and he a&s;&s;ures me, that in a dry &s;ea&s;on, the piers of a bridge are obvious in the bed of the river, &s;eemingly of Roman con&s;truction; and I have authority to &s;ay, that coins have been formerly ploughed up here, and lately &s;ome of the lower em|pire have al&s;o been di&s;covered within its vicinage. The ground plot and ramparts of the watch tower, which &s;erved for &s;ignals to this &s;tation, are vi&s;ible and almo&s;t entire at the entrance of Gillygate moor, and exactly corre&s;pond in form with tho&s;e on the Roman wall in Northumberland. At Newton-hall likewi&s;e, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, there has been an exploratory ca&s;trum, &s;eemingly for the &s;ecurity of Old Durham and Che&s;ter-le-Street.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="324">Maiden Ca&s;tle he places at Old Durham, and &s;uppo&s;es it a Roman camp: To illu&s;trate his &s;ubject, the tract is attended in the Archaeologia with a plate; which repre&s;ents the &s;uppo&s;ed face of a vallum, and &s;hews in the back ground a round mount. This &s;uppo&s;ed vallum is at pre&s;ent &s;o much levelled, that if ever it was forced, it now appears no otherwi&s;e than the &s;wift &s;lope of the bank on the &s;ide of the brook, and the mount is only a natural &s;well or rotundity of the back ground. The plot of ground cho&s;en by this gentleman for the &s;tation or camp, on the north-we&s;t &s;ide neare&s;t to old Durham, and where the brook doth not run, &s;hews &s;ome deep trenches and high earth fences; but the whole is &s;o irregular, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to derive any di&s;tinct figure from the remains of the works. He quotes Hollin&s;hed's Chronicle to &s;upport a conjecture, that about the year 930, this place &s;u&s;tained a &s;iege. We beg leave to compare this authority with others re|ferred to in the 3d page of this volume. We have not been fortunate enough in our reading, hitherto to di&s;|cover any evidence that William the Conqueror, when he laid wa&s;te the country, de&s;troyed this place, or <Q>that it &s;uffered the fate of many others in the northern parts, and that the fortifications were then partly levelled.</Q>&mdash;Dr Stukeley's de&s;cription may, perhaps more happily be applied to the place de&s;cribed by us, and delineated in our plate; it is certainly of "high ground" hanging "over the river." and almo&s;t full "ea&s;t" of the city: "Of an oblong form" one hundred and &s;eventy paces long on the mo&s;t extended &s;ide, which comes almo&s;t accurately to his de&s;cription, <Q>five hundred feet long, very &s;teep on three &s;ides, the neck guarded by a rampart, and without that, at &s;ome little di&s;tance, by a ditch.</Q> The la&s;t circum&s;tance noted by that author fixes the point. "The pro&s;pect is large, more e&s;pecially ea&s;tward." The elevation of Old Durham ground, pointed out by Mr Cade, <Q>no part is above fifteen feet from the plain, where any &s;lope lies upon the margin of the brook; and the pro&s;pect con&s;equently is bounded ea&s;tward, by the ter|mination of the vale, at the ri&s;ing grounds of Shincliff, not more than a quarter of a mile di&s;tant.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Cade's po&s;itions, in the treati&s;e from whence the foregoing extract is made, may, it is hoped, without an invidious appearance be &s;hortly commented on, to the intent the reader may form a competent idea of the circum&s;tances, or be led to enquire for him&s;elf upon the &s;pot.</P>

the cliff, which is almo&s;t perpendicular, and about one hundred feet in height. &mdash;On the right and left the &s;teep &s;ides of the mount are covered with a thick fore&s;t of oaks: The crown of the mount con&s;i&s;ts of a level area or plain, forty paces wide on the &s;ummit of the &s;car, in the front or north ea&s;t &s;ide, one hundred and &s;ixty paces long on the left-hand &s;ide, and one hundred and &s;eventy paces on the right. The approach is ea&s;y on the land &s;ide, from the &s;outh-we&s;t, fortified with a ditch and brea&s;t work: The entrance or pa&s;&s;age over the ditch is not in the middle, but made to corre&s;pond with the natural ri&s;e of the outward ground; probably this entrance was guarded by a draw-bridge: The ditch is twelve paces wide, and runs with a little curvature to each edge of the &s;lope, now covered with wood as before noted; on one hand being fifty paces in length, on the other eighty paces. After pa&s;&s;ing the ditch there is a level parade or platform,
<PB N="310" REF="324">
twenty paces wide, and then a high earth fence, now nine feet perpendicular, which, as in mo&s;t places of the like kind, it is apprehended, was faced with ma&s;on-work: A brea&s;t work has run from the earth fence on each hand along the brink of the hill, to the edge of the cliff or &s;car. The earth fence clo&s;es the whole neck of land, and is in length one hundred paces, forming the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the area. The&s;e particulars are illu&s;trated by the annexed plate. It is mo&s;t probable this was the <HI>vetus burgus Dunelmen&s;is</HI> noted in the records; it is at a little di&s;tance from the head of the &s;treet called Old Elvet, in a direct line therewith, and oppo|&s;ite to Old Durham, the river dividing it from the latter place, and almo&s;t filling up the intervening &s;pace: It was &s;upported anciently, as is pre&s;umed, by another fort|re&s;s called the <HI>Peel,</HI> erected on the oppo&s;ite eminence, which now bears the name of Peel Law. Many places in the northern counties retain the name of Peel and Law, implying ca&s;tle and hill, who&s;e antiquity may be traced back to the Saxon times. We pre&s;umed to offer an opinion, in the preceding pages, that in the valley over|looked by this fortre&s;s, the wandering Saxons &s;at down with the remains of Saint Cuthbert; and we &s;ubmit to the candour of the reader, whether that idea is alto|gether vague and improbable. The name of <HI>maiden</HI> applied to a ca&s;tle is now be|come indefinite; whether it imples <HI>beautiful,</HI> or a fortre&s;s which never has been conquered, has not been determined: Our be&s;t antiquaries give preference to the di&s;tinction <HI>fair</HI> or <HI>beautiful.</HI> The old fort, on Stainmore, in We&s;tmoreland, is called <HI>Maiden Ca&s;tle,</HI> and the adjoining inclo&s;ures bear the name of Peel-yard.</P>

The font is a large &s;tone ba&s;on, and there is a gallery over it which fills the whole we&s;t end of the nave. The roof is of wood, in the vault form, of excellent workman&s;hip, jointed with ro&s;e knots, the rafters &s;upport|ed

on brackets, ornamented with cherubs bearing &s;hields, but without blazoning of arms.

The church is well &s;talled, the chancel remarkably neat, and kept with that pious decency which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the &s;olemnities of divine wor&s;hip: It is 12 paces in length to the &s;teps of the altar rails, and &s;ix wide: The altar is elevated &s;ix &s;teps, and the &s;pace within the rails is upwards of 12 feet: The ea&s;t window con&s;i&s;ts of four lights, under a pointed arch; there are three windows on the north &s;ide, and four on the &s;outh, &s;ome of which are modern: Behind the table, and on each &s;ide, it is wain&s;cotted, painted, and gilded; and below the rails, the chancel is regularly &s;talled in the cathedral form with oak, having a large &s;eat at each &s;ide of the entrance gate. The roof is flat and &s;tuccoed. The ve&s;try room is al&s;o very neat. There is much broken painted gla&s;s in the windows, but no figure perfect. Again&s;t the &s;econd pillar, chained to a de&s;k, is "The defence of the apology of the church of England," with the &s;ermon preached at Paul's cro&s;s, by the bi&s;hop of Sarum, 1560, and other curious tracts. In the tower is a &s;et of &s;ix mu&s;ical bells. The vicarage hou&s;e is &s;weetly &s;ituated at the north entrance into the church-yard, on the banks of the river.</P>

<P>There was an ho&s;pital dedicated to St Leonard, in this pari&s;h; but who was the founder, what was the con&s;titution, or the time of its building, remain unknown: It is not named in the Mona&s;ticon, or any other authorities before us, &s;ave tho&s;e of the church of Durham. We are led to conjecture that this ho&s;pital &s;tood at Beau|trove or Butterby, as that manor is tithe-free, and &s;ituated near the medicinal &s;prings hereafter noted.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the &s;outh wall of the church-yard, is a field, called the Anchorage, (or Anchoritage, Hermitage, or Hermit's clo&s;e) and adjoining thereto is a field called the Palmer's (or Mendicant's) clo&s;e; but we have met with no evidence re|lative to a hermitage here.</P>
<P>From the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of the church-yard you enter upon tho&s;e beautiful natural &s;cenes which border the river. A walk is laid open, and kept in order for the recreation of the public, at the charge of the dean and chapter, who&s;e bene|volence on this and various other occa&s;ions, demands the warme&s;t acknowledg|ments. Mr Pennant, &s;peaking of the banks, &s;ays, they <Q>are covered with wood, through which are cut numbers of walks, contrived with judgment, and happy in the mo&s;t beautiful and &s;olemn &s;cenery. They impend over the water, and receive a mo&s;t venerable improvement from the ca&s;tle and ancient cathedral, which tower far above.</Q> The banks are &s;teep, and cloathed with fore&s;t trees;
<PB N="317" REF="331">
in &s;everal parts the rocks break forth, where venerable oaks are &s;u&s;pended: The river, with a pure and tranquil &s;tream, glides at the bottom of the hill, reflecting the noble objects which crown her banks: Here the opening valley pours forth a ri|vulet, and there the &s;olemn dell, with Nature's wilde&s;t beauties, yawns with broken rocks, which yield the living fountain from their lips, whil&s;t each brow is crowded with bending oaks, who&s;e naked talons and twi&s;ted arms rival each other in gro|te&s;que figure.

This pro&s;pect, perhaps, is not to be equalled in the environs of any city in the known world. On turning about, you have a view not le&s;s plea&s;ing for its &s;implicity; you command the walk before noted, with a fine bend of the river, forming a cre&s;cent; the banks richly cloathed with wood, and crowned with the church of St O&s;wald. This walk is much fre|quented, and de&s;ervedly has the applau&s;e of every traveller. We pre&s;ent to the reader two plates of tho&s;e favourite views on the banks.</P>
<P>The New Bridge was erected in 1781, at the expence of the dean and chapter, by Mr Nichol&s;on their architect: It is upon a beautiful modern plan, the arches &s;emicircular, with a balu&s;traded battlement. There was formerly a narrow bridge near this place for hor&s;es to pa&s;s, which was carried away by the floods in 1771 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>At this bridge there happened a remarkable accident: A Mr Dal&s;ton of the Cothamhall-garth family, forced his hor&s;e over the battlements, in the dark, and was killed; he was pa&s;&s;ing the bridge on return from a country vi&s;it with a large company, and though in the mid&s;t of them, was mi&s;&s;ed by none till they arrived at the hou&s;e where he was to lodge.</P>
<P>An account was given of the &s;tood in 1771, in the public prints. The waters were eight feet ten inches higher at Durham than ever known before.</P></NOTE>: The accident proved fortunate for the public, as it occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent hand|&s;ome &s;tructure <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the plate.</NOTE> to be erected, which being of a &s;uitable width, the chapter permit gentlemen's carriages to pa&s;s thereon, without toll.</P>
<P>FRAMWELGATE BRIDGE, &s;een upon this view, has one pier and two elliptic arches, of ninety feet &s;pan, &s;o flat as to be con&s;tructed on the quarter &s;ection of a circle, calculated to &s;uit the low &s;hores on each &s;ide: The ma&s;onry is plain, but ex|cellent, as is proved by its age; it was built by bi&s;hop Flambard, has &s;tood near &s;even hundred years, and is perhaps the fine&s;t model of bridge-building, of that antiquity, in Britain. A gateway tower which &s;tood on the city end of the bridge, was removed of late years for the conveniency of carriages, which have encrea&s;ed amazingly in number within this century.

<P>When the church and other edifices at Finchale were erected, the remains of which are yet &s;tanding, it is not po&s;&s;ible to determine with preci&s;ion, no evidence thereof being found in the archives of the dean and chapter: From the order of building &s;een in &s;ome parts of the ruins, much may be attributed to Henry the bi&s;hop's &s;on; but other parts appear of older date. The &s;olemn remains are
<PB N="322" REF="338">
&s;ituated in a very deep vale, on the banks of the river, where the &s;tream making a &s;weep, forms a little level plot, which is almo&s;t covered with the buildings; &s;hel|tered to the north by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of Cocken, and on every other &s;ide by &s;teep hills. The river flows &s;wiftly over a rocky channel; and the murmuring of the waterfalls is re-echoed from the groves and cliffs. The pre&s;ent buildings are much di&s;united, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to trace all the ancient offices of this religious man&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the entrance into the church, at the we&s;t end, on the right-hand, is a &s;quare vault, the roof of which is groined from the angles and the &s;ide walls, and &s;upport|ed in the center by a &s;hort octagonal pillar: There was an aqueduct to this place, and it had an upper apartment. The church, though &s;mall, is in the form of a cro&s;s; the gateway, at the we&s;t end, has a pointed arch of &s;everal members, ri&s;ing from &s;mall round columns or pila&s;ters, with plain capitals: The nave is twenty-eight paces in length, and &s;even in width. In the center of the cro&s;s it appears there has been a tower or &s;pire, &s;upported on four circular pillars, very &s;hort and heavy, exceeding even part of Durham cathedral for di&s;proportion: The pillars are &s;o ma&s;&s;ive, that one of them contains a turpike &s;tairca&s;e, which led to the &s;uper|&s;tructure; they form a &s;quare of equal &s;ides, twenty-one feet from pillar to pillar, the capitals of an octagonal form: The center had a dome or vaulted roof, with in|ter&s;ecting ribs, and on the ea&s;t &s;ide one pointed arch remains. In the etching given in Stevens' Mona&s;ticon, drawn by King, a &s;hort octagonal &s;pire of &s;tone is placed on the tower. On the north &s;ide of the nave, are four pillars &s;upporting pointed arches; the pillars round, with capitals formed of double rolls, con&s;tructed of a durable &s;tone, and entire; the &s;outh &s;ide is clo&s;e, a long cloi&s;ter or pa&s;&s;age running on the out&s;ide to communicate with the &s;outh limb of the cro&s;s. The north and &s;outh limbs of the cro&s;s are exactly equal in length and width, being twelve paces long and &s;even broad: They are very ill lighted; one great window in the &s;outh limb, towards the ea&s;t, being the chief: Indeed it appears that tho&s;e parts have been added to the original &s;tructure, or rebuilt; as they are in no wi&s;e &s;imilar to the other parts in ma&s;onry or materials. The choir is remarkable; from the ea&s;t window, ten paces in length, it is inclo&s;ed with high dark walls, and from thence to the cro&s;s, being nine paces, (the whole nineteen paces long) are two round columns on each &s;ide, &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the nave, bearing three pointed arches: The ea&s;t window has been &s;ive paces wide, (as appears from the mea&s;ure|ment of the &s;ole, for all the re&s;t is gone) with outward buttre&s;&s;es, ornamented with &s;tone pinnacles, one of which on the &s;outh &s;ide &s;till remains. It is very &s;ingular that windows of a modern date have been placed between the pillars, to fill up the arches, formed of a yellow and peri&s;hable kind of &s;tone; which work now &s;eparates it&s;elf from the arches: The yellow &s;tone has been won from the bed of the river, and is of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e of which the out-buildings are con&s;tructed; the co|lumns and arches are of a bluer nature, and in no wi&s;e injured by time; they &s;eem to be of the Normandy &s;tone, much like the columns and ca&s;tings of &s;everal of the ancient ca&s;tles. Allowing this ob&s;ervation to be ju&s;t, we &s;hould be apt to conjec|ture the&s;e columns and arches originally divided the center from a &s;ide aile; but
<PB N="323" REF="339">
on &s;trict &s;earch, no foundations or other work was di&s;covered which could encourage this idea: If there were no &s;ide ailes, then this was a fabric of &s;ingular con&s;truction; for it will follow, that the nave and part of the choir were open to the air on the &s;ides, like a cloi&s;ter: There is &s;omething &s;imilar in the abbey of Furne&s;s, in Lan|ca&s;hire, where a part on the north &s;ide is open. The founder, in imitation of the &s;everities of St Godric, might think it expedient to deprive the monks of indul|gence, and leave the church open to the air; but in after ages, when the religious profe&s;&s;ed more out&s;ide &s;hew than real zeal, yielded to the fa&s;cinations of luxury, and &s;tudied gratifications and &s;oftne&s;s, they clo&s;ed the arches with windows, made covered pa&s;&s;ages, and transformed this building to its pre&s;ent model: As its &s;olenm beauties are much admired, if the windows were di&s;placed, and the co|lumns and arches laid open, it would greatly improve its appearance, and render it &s;till a finer objet from the walks of Cocken.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the mona&s;tic buildings are very ragged and ruinous: In one part a bow window is projected from a pila&s;ter in the wall, and &s;eems to have appertained to &s;ome chief apartment. The hall or refectory has been a hand&s;ome edifice; it &s;tands on the &s;outh &s;ide of a court, nearly of equal &s;ides, about twenty-&s;ix paces every way; is twelve paces long, and eight wide, within the walls; having five re|gular windows to the &s;outh, and four to the north; in the &s;tairca&s;e or entrance is a large window to the &s;outh: The vault underneath is &s;upported by a row of four octagonal pillars in the center, without capitals, from whence the groins are &s;prung; the pila&s;ters in the walls and angles are capitalled; the ribs are of hewn &s;tone, meeting in points, and the inter&s;tices of the vault wedged with thin &s;tones; the whole a fine piece of architecture. This vault is lighted by &s;ix &s;mall windows to the &s;outh, and is not above eight feet in height to the crowns of the arches.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that St Godric, and al&s;o Henry de Puteaco, or Pud&s;ey, lie interred here; but the floor of the church is covered with ruins, and grown over with brambles and weeds, &s;o as to prevent, without much labour, a &s;earch for their tombs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Henricus de Puteaco, &s;on to Hugh Puteacus, was founder of Finke&s;hal priorye, on Were, two mils be|nethe Dure&s;me, and there is he buried, and al&s;o S.

<HEAD>BUTTERBY,</HEAD>
<P>anciently written <HI>Beautrove,</HI> from its beautiful &s;ituation. The river Were runs almo&s;t round the chief part of the e&s;tate, the neck of land which divides the &s;treams being only about two hundred yards wide. Here, it has been imagined, &s;tood the ancient ho&s;pital of St Leonard; the founder and in&s;titution not now known. The lands are remarkably fertile; the river near the hou&s;e falls &s;wiftly over a rough channel, under high rocky &s;hores and hanging woods: On the more di&s;tant &s;ide of the e&s;tate the river flows deep and &s;low, forming a canal a mile in length, where the adjacent lands make a con&s;iderable plain. There is not a &s;weeter rural &s;cene in the whole county, unadorned and in &s;imple nature, for art has not yet extended her hand hither, further than in the ordinary cour&s;e of agri|culture. As this place is remarkable for its beauty, &s;o it is for natural curio&s;ities; &s;urrounded with the river, from the fi&s;&s;ure of a rock, which lies about forty feet from the &s;hore, flows a con&s;iderable &s;pring of &s;alt water, mixed with a mineral quality. The &s;ituation of this &s;pring &s;ubjects it to a mixture of fre&s;h water, &s;o that it is difficult to know how much &s;alt it contains in its pure&s;t &s;tate; on &s;everal trials it has yielded double the quantity produced from &s;ea water. The &s;hore for a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance &s;hews many ouzings, or &s;mall i&s;&s;ues of &s;alt water; from which cir|cum&s;tance, and by a dike or break of the rocks in the channel of the river, a little above the &s;pring, it is pre&s;umed a rock or bed of &s;alt might be won of &s;ome value: It has never been &s;earched for; the family who lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the e&s;tate, from a love of retirement and ea&s;e, neglected a trial. The &s;pring is much re&s;orted to in &s;um|mer for its medical qualities; but as the well is not inclo&s;ed by any building, it is frequently overflowed by the river. This water is reputed to be an effectual reme|dy for a di&s;ea&s;e known among people employed in &s;melting and refining hou&s;es be|longing to the lead works. Half a pint is &s;ufficiently purgative for the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;on. Within a few yards of the &s;alt &s;pring, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, is a fluent &s;pring &s;trongly impregnated with &s;ulphur, without any vitriolic or other compound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We find the following account of this &s;pring in Gib&s;on's edition of Camden, which is tran&s;cribed almo&s;t literally from Baker's Chronicle.</P>
<P>The Spadacrene is between Butterby and Durham on Elvet moor.</P>
<P>A little below Bran&s;peth, the Were has many huge &s;tones in its channel, never covered but when the river is overflowed by rains: Upon the&s;e if you pour water, and it mix a little with the &s;tone, it becomes bracki&s;h, a thing which happens nowhere el&s;e. Nay, at Butterby, a little village, when the river is &s;hallow, and &s;unk from the&s;e &s;tones in the &s;ummer time, there bur&s;ts out of them a reddi&s;h &s;alt water, which grows &s;o white and hard by the heat of the &s;un (as hath been thought) that they who live thereabouts u&s;e it for &s;alt. But that the &s;altne&s;s it&s;elf proceeds not from the heat of the &s;un, is plain by experience, in that which is mo&s;t &s;alti&s;h, and i&s;&s;ues out of a rock, in as much as if all the water be laved out of the place, there immediately bubbles out of the body of the rock a water as &s;alt as the former; and be&s;ides, the rock out of which it i&s;&s;ues is a &s;alt rock of a &s;parkling &s;ub&s;tance. On the other &s;ide of the Were, there is al&s;o a medicinal &s;pring of &s;trong &s;ulphur; and above it, towards Durham, is a mineral water, of the vitriolic kind, upon which Dr Wil&s;on wrote his Spadacrene Dunelmen&s;is.</P>
<P>In Lowthorp's Abridgment of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, vol. ii. p. 333, the following account is in|&s;erted, given by Mr Hugh Todd.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half out of Durham, on the north ea&s;t &s;ide near Butterby, was lately di&s;covered a me|dicinal &s;pring, which is much frequented, and may be of great benefit to the country. It was found by workmen that dug in that place for coal. When they were twelve fathom and a half deep they di&s;covered this trea&s;ure of natural phy&s;ic. They then tried the rock about one hundred yards off, where they lo&s;t them|&s;elves much about the &s;ame depth, and in&s;tead of coal, di&s;covered an excellent &s;pring of clear water, which i&s;&s;ues out of the hole their in&s;truments made. The&s;e &s;prings are in a deep gill or valley on the &s;hore oppo&s;ite to Butterby.</P>

<P><PB N="331" REF="347">A &s;mall rivulet runs at the foot of the plea&s;ure grounds, called Croxdale beck; this water pa&s;&s;es through a very romantic channel, and &s;upplies a paper-mill: It makes its way in a deep and narrow dell, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to admit a winding road to the mill. The rocks on each hand are &s;haken and columnar, affording &s;everal grand and awful &s;cenes; the precipices overhang the vale; and large fore&s;t trees, bend|ing from the cliffs, extend their &s;olemn &s;hade on every &s;ide. The natural grottos watered with ca&s;cades, the mo&s;&s;y banks, the falling &s;treams of the brook, the gloom of the thick foliage, the grote&s;que rocks, the &s;preading arms of the oaks, the gra&s;&s;y plots that border the rivulets, all con&s;pire to plea&s;e the mind that has a ta&s;te for &s;olitude, romantic &s;cenes, and rural meditation. Was a little art employed to &s;mooth the paths, to remove &s;ome few deformities, and with a &s;kilful hand to dre&s;s the wild beauties of the vale, we know not where a more extraordinary &s;cene could be found. The dell is &s;o deep, that on very few days in the year the &s;un's rays touch the mill-hou&s;e, and a per&s;on might live there for an age and never enjoy that &s;pectacle. In days of deep ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, this dell was thought to be the re&s;idence of evil &s;pirits; an idea which gained credit, perhaps, from its being a place re&s;orted to by robbers and vagabonds. To bani&s;h the infernal inhabitants, a cro&s;s was erected here, which gave name to the adjacent lands, this being in &s;e|veral old writings wrote <HI>Croixdale;</HI> &s;o the de&s;ert of Cro&s;s-fell, in Cumberland, is in old authors and charts called <HI>Fiends Fell;</HI> and &s;ince the erection of a cro&s;s there|on, to vanqui&s;h the legions of Satan, it has obtained the pre&s;ent name of Cro&s;s-Fell.</P>

<P>ALDERNAGE HOUSE, otherwi&s;e called Aldin-Grainge, in a plea&s;ant retired &s;itu|ation on the banks of the Brune, was the place of re&s;idence of John Bedford, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> M.

S. A. 1782.&mdash;"The name of Bedford has occured &s;o often in this volume, that it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the family. Hilkiah Bedford, of Sib&s;ey, in Lincoln&s;hire, a Quaker, came to London, and &s;ettled there as a &s;tationer, between the years 1600 and 1625. He married a daughter of Mr Wm Platt, of Highgate, by whom he had a &s;on, Hil|kiah, a mathematical in&s;trument maker, in Ho&s;ier-lane, near We&s;t-Smithfield. In this hou&s;e (which was afterwards burnt in the great fire of London, 1666) was born the famous Hilkiah, July 23, 1663; who, in 1667, was admitted of St John's college, Cambridge, the fir&s;t &s;cholar on the foundation of his maternal grandfather, William Platt. Hilkiah was afterwards elected fellow of his college, and patroni&s;ed by Hen|cage Finch, earl of Winchel&s;ea, but deprived of his preferment (which was in Lincoln&s;hire) for refu&s;ing to take the oaths at the Revolution, and afterwards kept a boarding-hou&s;e for the We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;cholars. In 1714, being tried in the court of King's Bench, he was fined 1000 marks, and impri&s;oned three years, for writing, printing, and publi&s;hing "The Hereditary Right of the Crown of England a&s;&s;erted, 1713," folio; the real author of which was George Harbin, a nonjuring clergyman, whom his friend&s;hip thus &s;creened, and on account of his &s;ufferings he received 100l. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps the pocketing of the hundred pounds required no ceremony; for Bedford "was pro&s;ecuted, and &s;uffered impri&s;onment for fathering" the book; which notorious fact, known to lord Weymouth and all the world, might &s;ufficiently account for the benefaction to Bedford, whether he was looked upon to be the author of the book or not. But the &s;trange part of the &s;tory is, that Harbin, the author of the book, &s;hould carry the money to him as the real author.</P></NOTE> from the earl of Weymouth, who knew not the real author. His other publications were, a tran&s;lation of an an&s;wer to Fontenelle's Hi&s;tory of Oracles, and a Latin life of Dr Barwick, which he afterwards tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h. He died in 1724.

victory) lay at Beaurepaire. In the Chronique of William de Pakington, it is thus &s;poken of: <Q>About this tyme, by the meane of Philip Valoys, king of France, David, king of Scottes enterid yn to the north marches, &s;poiling and burning, and toke by force the pyle of Lydelle, and cau&s;id the noble knight Walter Selby captayne of it, to be &s;layne afore his owne face, not &s;uffering him &s;o much as to be confe&s;&s;ed. And after he cam to the co&s;te of Dyrham, and lay there at a place caullid Beaurepaire, a manor of the prior of Dure&s;me, &s;et in a parke; and thither re&s;orted many of the cuntery aboute, compounding with hym to &s;pare their groundes and manurs. Then William Souch, archebi&s;hop of York, the counte of Anegos, Moun&s;eir John de Montbraye, Moun&s;eir Henry de Percy, Moun&s;eir Rafe de Neville, Moun&s;eir Rafe de Ha&s;tinges, Moun&s;eir Thomas de Rokeby, then &s;heriff of York&s;hire, and other knightes and good men of the northe, marchid toward the Scottes, and fir&s;t lay yn Akeland park, and in the morning encounterid with Syr William Duglas, killing of his band 200 menne; and he, with much payne, e&s;capid to Burepaire, to king David, declaring the cuming of the Engli&s;h ho&s;t. Wher then king David i&s;&s;ued, and faught upon a more nere to Dure&s;me toune, and there was taken pri&s;oner, and with hym Syr Wylliam Douglas, the Counte of Menethe, and the Counte of Fyfe, and greate numbre of the communes of Scotland &s;layn. The king, becau&s;e he was wondid in the face, he was caried to Werk, and there he lyd, and thens brought to Lon|don.</Q> We have repeated this account becau&s;e it contains &s;ome circum&s;tances not named by modern authors. The year in which this battle was fought, was pro|ductive of the mo&s;t glorious laurels that wreathed the &s;word of Edward III. and the Scotch received &s;uch humiliations as that nation never before experienced.
<PB N="339" REF="355">
The king of England, with an army greatly inferior to his foes, by the valour and intrepid conduct of his heroic &s;on, obtained a glorious victory at Cre&s;&s;y. He then formed a blockade before Calais, which, with other di&s;tre&s;&s;es, induced the king of France to &s;end propo&s;als to the court of Scotland, for making an inva&s;ion on the borders: The ab&s;ence of Edward, the va&s;t &s;upplies of men and money which his campaign required, the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of England, afforded a probable appearance that David's projected expedition might be attended with &s;ucce&s;s: The king of France's object was not honour to the Scotch crown, but to amu&s;e the king of England, or draw off &s;ome of his forces: A con&s;iderable &s;um of money and rein|forcement of troops were &s;ent into Scotland, and the king, with the a&s;&s;ent of his parliament a&s;&s;embled at Perth, engaged in the expedition. Edward having enter|tained doubts, that during his ab&s;ence a &s;torm would be gathering on the brow of his known adver&s;ary, di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to the court of Scotland, to amu&s;e by offers of a re&s;titution of Berwick, on condition that the Scotch would &s;tand neuter in the conflicts between England and France; but contrary to the opinion of many of his mo&s;t &s;kilful peers, David rejected the propo&s;ed terms of amity, and prepared to invade England: He collected a powerful army, con&s;i&s;ting, according to Rapin, of 30,000 men; other authors, particularly Froi&s;&s;art, Speed, Barnes, and Knighton greatly exaggerate the numbers; with the&s;e, in the beginning of October, 1346, David entered England by the we&s;tern march, &s;hewing tokens of a bloody and &s;a|vage mind in his out&s;et, by putting the garri&s;on of Liddell tower to the &s;word, and marking his progre&s;s through Cumberland with wanton &s;laughter and de&s;olation. He advanced to the county of Durham, and approached the city. The queen of England &s;ummoned the prelates and military tenants to attend her at York, where mea&s;ures were concerted for oppo&s;ing the invaders, and a body of troops, amount|ing to about 16,000 men, were a&s;&s;embled with all &s;peed; whil&s;t David, with his army, lay at Beaurepaire, the a&s;&s;ociate lords encamped in Auckland park. Douglas, with a cho&s;en troop, reconnoitering the Engli&s;h, was engaged near Merrington; his detachment was put to the rout, and he e&s;caped to the king with much peril. Rapin tells us, the queen of England led the Engli&s;h forces to battle; but that a&s;|&s;ertion is not &s;upported by any cotemporary writer of credit: David looked upon his adver&s;aries as a raw and undi&s;ciplined army, not able to &s;tand again&s;t his hardy veterans, and &s;hewed &s;igns of great impatience before the troops engaged, pre|&s;uming that victory was certain, and that the riches of the city were due to his plundering &s;oldiers: The Engli&s;h army was drawn up in four divi&s;ions; lord Henry Percy commanded the fir&s;t, &s;upported by the earl of Angus, the bi&s;hop of Durham, and &s;everal northern nobles; the &s;econd body was led by the archbi&s;hop of York, accompanied by the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, and the lords Nevill and Ha&s;tings; the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, the lord Mowbray, and Sir Thomas Roke&s;by led the third di|vi&s;ion; and at the head of the fourth was Edward Baliol, &s;upported by the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, the lord Roos, and the &s;heriff of Northumberland: Each divi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of four thou&s;and men, and the archers and men at arms were di&s;tributed through the whole corps: The author of the Border Hi&s;tory, probably from his own conjecture, for he quotes no authority, alledges <Q>That be&s;ides the

forces above named, a &s;trong and gallant party under the lords Deincourt and Ogle, guarded queen Philippa, who, in the morning before the battle, having rode along the ranks, and exhorted every man to do his duty, to maintain the honour of his king and country, and take revenge upon their barbarous inva|ders, recommended her people to the protection of God, and retired to a &s;mall di&s;tance from the place of action.</Q> The Scotch army was drawn out in three divi&s;ions; the fir&s;t was led by the high &s;teward of Scotland, and the earl of March; the earl of Murray and lord Douglas commanded the &s;econd; and the third, con|&s;i&s;ting of choice troops, in which were incorporated the flower of the Scotti&s;h no|bility and gentry, &s;u&s;tained by the French auxiliaries, was commanded by the king in per&s;on. With much heroic ardour the Scotch king ordered the trumpets to &s;ound the charge: The high &s;teward, who led the van, being &s;ore galled by the Engli&s;h archers, ru&s;hed on with &s;uch impetuous fury, that he threw them into con|fu&s;ion, and drove them back on lord Henry Percy's divi&s;ion; and the Scotch pu&s;h|ing on vigorou&s;ly with their broad &s;words and battle axes, broke them &s;o much, that if relief had not in&s;tantly been &s;ent them, they would have been put to the rout; but Baliol, ru&s;hing in with a body of hor&s;e, threw the Scotch battalion into confu&s;ion, and gave the Engli&s;h time to rally and regain their ground, whil&s;t the high &s;teward was obliged to retreat and reform his di&s;tracted array: In this ma|noeuvre he is &s;aid to have &s;hewn great general&s;hip, performing the evolutions in a ma&s;terly manner, and with little lo&s;s. Baliol, with equal &s;kill, gave his troops breath, made no pur&s;uit, and when lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, rapidly charged the king's di|vi&s;ion in flank, whil&s;t they fought man to man in front: Unrelieved, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with this complicated battle, the king fought de&s;perately, repeatedly bringing back his flying troops to the charge, encouraging them by his example, his exhortations and prayers: A&s;hamed to de&s;ert their prince in &s;uch jeopardy, a brave phalanx threw them&s;elves around him, and fought till their numbers were reduced to little more than eighty: In this de&s;perate &s;tate, and bleeding with many wounds, David &s;corned to a&s;k for quarter, hoping he &s;hould &s;till be relieved, At length re&s;i&s;tance was vain, a tumultuous multitude, with &s;houts of victory, ru&s;hed upon him; and he at length was made pri&s;oner to John Copeland, a Northumbrian e&s;quire. The divi&s;ion under Douglas and Murray, &s;truck with a panic at the fate of the royal legion, and overpowered with numbers, were &s;oon broken and routed: Murray died on the field, and Douglas was made pri&s;oner, and few of the inferior officers e&s;caped the &s;word. <Q>The Scotch king, though he had two &s;pears hanging in his body, his leg de&s;perately wounded, and being di&s;armed, his &s;word having been beat out of his hand, di&s;dained captivity, and provoked the Engli&s;h by opprobious language to kill him: When John Copeland, who was governor of Roxborough ca&s;tle, advi&s;ed him to yield, he &s;truck him on the face with his gauntlet &s;o fiercely, that he knocked out two of his teeth: Copeland conveyed him out of the field as his pri&s;oner. Upon Copeland's refu&s;ing to deliver him up (his royal captive) to the queen, who &s;tayed at Newca&s;tle during the battle, the king &s;ent for him to Calais, where he excu&s;ed his refu&s;al &s;o hand&s;omely, that the king &s;ent him back a reward of 500l. a year in lands, where he him&s;elf &s;hould chu&s;e it, near his own

Among the pri&s;oners were the earls of Fife, Sutherland, Monteith, Carrick, and Wigton, the lord Douglas, the bi&s;hops of St Andrew and Aberdeen, James Douglas, &s;ir Malcolm Fleming, with many men of di&s;tinction. Hi&s;torians have not mentioned what particular lo&s;s was &s;u&s;tained on the part of the Engli&s;h. Knighton tells us of four knights and five e&s;quires only, who fell in the field; and Dugdale &s;ays the lord Ha&s;tings was mortally wounded: But in &s;o bloody a battle it is impo&s;&s;ible but many men of di&s;tinction would fall in the Engli&s;h army.</P>
<P>The ground where this battle was fought is hilly, and in many parts very &s;teep, towards the river, &s;o that it is not po&s;&s;ible to conceive how &s;uch an armament could be arranged and engage in any order. The account given of this battle, and of the &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions of the convent, by the writers of that hou&s;e, as pub|li&s;hed by Davies, and contained in Sir John Law&s;on's MSS. and Mr Hogg's Roll, is to the effect given in the notes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the night before the battle of Durham, there appeared to John Fo&s;&s;our, then prior of the abbey of Durham, a vi&s;ion, commanding him to take the holy corporax cloth, wherewith St Cuthbert covered the chalice when he u&s;ed to &s;ay ma&s;s, and to put the &s;ame upon a &s;pear point, and next morning to repair to a place on the we&s;t of the city of Durham, called the Red Hills, and there to remain till the end of the battle.&mdash; The prior and monks, accompanied with Ralph lord Nevil, and John Nevil his &s;on, lord Percy, and many other nobles, returned to the abbey church, there joining in prayer and thank&s;giving to God, and holy St Cuthbert, for the conque&s;t obtained that day: In which battle a holy cro&s;s, taken out of Holy Rood Hou&s;e, in Scotland, by king David Bruce, was taken from the &s;aid king; which cro&s;s is recorded, by ancient and credible writers, to have come to the &s;aid king mo&s;t miraculou&s;ly: Being hunting the hart in a fore&s;t near Edinburgh, upon Holy Rood day. In the place where this miracle was wrought, now &s;prings a fountain, called the Rood well. The night after he was warned in his &s;leep to build an abbey in the &s;ame place.&mdash; Many excellent jewels and monuments brought from Scotland, and noblemen's banners, were offered to the &s;hrine of St Cuthbert; together with the black rood of Scotland.</P>
<P>The banner cloth was a yard broad, and five quarters deep, the bottom was indented in five parts, and fringed, and made fa&s;t all about with red &s;ilk and gold. It was made of red velvet, on both &s;ides em|broidered with flowers of green &s;ilk and gold; and in the mid&s;t was the &s;aid corporax cloth inclo&s;ed, covered over with white velvet, half a yard &s;quare every way, having a cro&s;s of red velvet on both &s;ides, be|ing fringed about the edge and &s;kirts with red &s;ilk and gold, and three fine little &s;ilver bells fa&s;tened to the &s;kirts of the &s;aid banner cloth, like unto &s;acring bells.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of the city of Durham, where two roads pa&s;s each other, a mo&s;t famous and ele|gant cro&s;s of &s;tone work was erected to the honour of God, for the victory there obtained, known by the name of Nevil's cro&s;s, and built at the &s;ole co&s;t of lord Ralph Nevil; which cro&s;s had &s;even &s;teps about it, every way &s;quared, to the &s;ocket wherein the &s;talk of the cro&s;s &s;tood, which &s;ocket was fa&s;tened to a large &s;quare &s;tone, the &s;ole or bottom &s;tone being of a great thickne&s;s, viz. a yard and a half every way: This &s;tone was the eighth &s;tep. The &s;talk of the cro&s;s was in length three yards and a half up to the bo&s;s, having eight &s;ides all of one piece; from the &s;ocket it was fixed into the bo&s;s above, into which bo&s;s the &s;talk was deeply &s;oldered with lead. In the mid&s;t of the &s;talk, in every &s;econd &s;quare, was the Nevil's cro&s;s: A &s;altire, in a '&s;cutcheon, being lord Nevil's arms, finely cut; and at every corner of the &s;ocket was a picture of one of the four evangeli&s;ts, finely &s;et forth and carved. The bo&s;s at the top of the &s;talk was an octangular &s;tone, finely cut and bordered, and mo&s;t curiou&s;ly wrought; and in every &s;quare of the nether &s;ide thereof was Nevil's cro&s;s, in one &s;quare, and the bull's head in the next, &s;o in the &s;ame reciprocal or|der about the bo&s;s.

<P>Lanche&s;ter appears to have decrea&s;ed greatly of late years, and now is a mere &s;tragling village, placed in a warm and well-&s;heltered valley, with a fine &s;tream of water, called Smallhop Burn, running through it.

<P><Q>Mr Hor&s;ley &s;uppo&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Hor&s;ley's Britan. Rom. p. 450, 451.</P>
<P>Mr Camden was of opinion that Lanche&s;ter was the Roman <HI>Longovicum,</HI> and by what Dr Hunter hath written to the Royal Society about it, we have rea&s;on to re&s;t in that conjecture; for he &s;ays, that &s;everal in|&s;criptions have been dug up there, and the Roman &s;treet called <HI>Watling &s;treet</HI> lies through it. It is &s;eated on the top of a hill, and overlooked by another. By the ruins we may di&s;cern it has been a much larger place, in a &s;quare form, and fortified with a thick &s;trong &s;tone wall, about which now both within and without are nothing but ruins and rubbi&s;h. It is probable that the buildings within the walls were all public, viz. temples, palaces, and &s;tations for the &s;oldiers, and perhaps lodgings for the garri&s;on. No doubt this colony was adorn|ed with many beautiful buildings. The in&s;criptions found here &s;ince Mr Camden's time are as follows.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>They are all noted in the following extracts.</HI></P>
<P>When I was la&s;t there I looked at the pillars which had &s;upported the floors of what is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a balneum They were not all alike, nor of a very regular figure, but yet there was &s;ome &s;imilitude and proportion between them; they are all about two feet and five inches high, perhaps two Roman feet and a half. The angles or corners of four &s;quare &s;tones re&s;ted on each of the&s;e pillars, and between each, two pil|lars was more than a yard di&s;tance. Upon the &s;quare &s;tones had been a plai&s;tering about four inches thick,
<PB N="359" REF="375">con&s;i&s;ting of lime and &s;mall pieces of brick. The marks of fire and &s;moke were very vi&s;ible when they fir&s;t di&s;covered the place. I was al&s;o informed that there was another &s;et of pillars underneath, which &s;upported another &s;uch floor, and &s;ome &s;ort of metal upon it, on which the upper &s;et of pillars re&s;ted. The lower pillars &s;tood upon a blue clay, and the intervals between them were filled up with earth and rubbi&s;h. It was con|jectured that the fir&s;t had failed or been de&s;troyed, and that the &s;econd had been built on its ruins. Above this (according to the account I had, for there are no remains of it now) was a &s;quare room, having each &s;ide about four yards long, and the walls plai&s;tered in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame materials as the floor. The altar hereafter de&s;cribed was found at the ea&s;t end of this room, with its back undre&s;&s;ed towards the wall. I have been more particular in this de&s;cription becau&s;e it has not been &s;ufficiently given before; but the other remains and monuments here I &s;hall al&s;o largely de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>There is a very con&s;iderable tumulus about a mile from Lanche&s;ter, called the <HI>Maiden Law,</HI> and probably the military way has not been far from this tumulus.</P>

<P>This and the next are two curious and u&s;eful in&s;criptions, which, with mo&s;t of the following, were made public in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, N^o 266, 354, from Dr Hunter, and have mo&s;t of them been in&s;erted in Camden. The originals are now in the library at Durham. Mr Gale thinks, that the <HI>Legio</HI> here called <HI>Gordiana,</HI> was the <HI>legio &s;exta victrix,</HI> which continued &s;o long in the north, and had its &s;tated quarters at York, whil&s;t the other legions had their's at a much greater di&s;tance. Yet we have an in&s;cription at this very place by the leg. xxvv. which was employed not far from hence in building or repairing &s;ome &s;tructure, as appears from the in&s;cription at Whitley ca&s;tle, in Northumberland. The&s;e in&s;criptions are valuable, as they have pre&s;erved to us the names of two propraetors, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have been lo&s;t. For as Mr Gale ob|&s;erves, from <HI>Virius Lupus,</HI> who was propraetor under Severus in the year 208, to <HI>Nonnius Phillippus,</HI> (whom he believes to have &s;ucceeded the latter of the&s;e here mentioned) to the year 242, the name of no other pro|praetor or legate is any where el&s;e to be met with. It is highly probable that the two here mentioned imme|diately &s;ucceed one another, becau&s;e both in&s;criptions were erected not only under the &s;ame emperor, but under the &s;ame commander of the cohort <HI>Aurelius Quirinus,</HI> who had the care of both the&s;e works. This, as Dr Hunter informs us, was found about one hundred yards ca&s;t of the fort, the other within the &s;ort, which confirms Mr Gale's opinion, that the &s;oldiers lodged within the &s;ort. The <HI>Ba&s;aliacae</HI> of the ancients were public buildings, in which cau&s;es were heard, and merchants met for bu&s;ine&s;s; they were adorned with pillars and covered walks: Vitruvius has given a de&s;cription of them, and &s;o has Palladio from him. This &s;tone is broke through the middle, and &s;ome of the letters are damaged or lo&s;t, but it is ea&s;y to &s;upply them. And this in&s;cription &s;eems rather to be wor&s;e cut, and to be the later of the two. As for the <HI>pre</HI> for <HI>per</HI> and <HI>Gn.</HI> for <HI>Gneium</HI> in the fourth line, it would be ea&s;y to produce other parallel in&s;tances, as al&s;o of <HI>L</HI> for <HI>Legionis.</HI> But Mr Ward is inclined to think <Q>that <HI>pre</HI> at the beginning of the fourth line was not de&s;igned for <HI>per,</HI> and that the following word &s;hould not be read <HI>Gneium,</HI> but <HI>Egnatium,</HI> a name that frequently occurs in Gru|ter. His rea&s;on for reading it thus is, that in all &s;uch mixtures of &s;maller letters again&s;t the middle of lar|ger in the &s;ame word, the word always begins with a letter of the larger &s;ize; and as for the <HI>E</HI> he imagines it was not intended to &s;erve both words by being read twice, becau&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;es, which are very rare, the letter to be repeated is always found in a complex character. He &s;uppo&s;es, therefore, that there has either been a &s;mall <HI>e</HI> between <HI>PR,</HI> which is now defaced, or that it was de&s;igned to be put there, but was forgot, as it ea&s;ily might be.</Q>&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 11, p. 289.</BIBL></P>

<P>So much has been &s;aid already concerning this in&s;cription, under the former and another in Northumber|land, that little more need be added here; it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the Emperor's name is here at length <HI>Antonius,</HI> as it is printed al&s;o in the <HI>Fa&s;ti Con&s;ulares.</HI> We have likewi&s;e &s;ome other in&s;tances of it in Mont&s;aucon.

<P>Mr Hor&s;ley's corre&s;pondent had furni&s;hed him with a very inaccu|rate drawing; the cut was made from the original in the dean and chapter's library, in April 1776.

<P>N^o 5, plate. <HI>Genio Praetori Claudius Epaphroditus Claudianus Tribunus Cohortis &s;ecundae Lingonum, votum libens po&s;uit merito.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;tone looks like a pede&s;tal, and &s;eems by its regular &s;quare cavity at the top to have had &s;omething fixed upon it, but it is nothing like the ba&s;e of an altar. The letters are tolerably well cut. I at fir&s;t was doubtful if the fir&s;t line might have been <HI>Genio Praetoris,</HI> but upon examining the original, I &s;aw every letter very plain, and was convinced that there neither was nor ever had been an <HI>S</HI> at the end. I then thought it might be a flattering compliment to the un-named praetor, as if he was their genius or tutelar god. But my learned friend Mr Ward, judges this too high a compliment to be paid by a tribune to a praetor, and ob|&s;erves that <HI>Genius</HI> is a proper name frequent in Gruter. It is therefore my pre&s;ent opinion, that this &s;tone has &s;u&s;tained &s;ome pillar, or &s;omewhat of that nature; and that the monument has been erected to the ho|nour of <HI>Genius the praetor.</HI> If we read <HI>votum po&s;uit,</HI> the word <HI>votum</HI> mu&s;t by a trope be taken here for the thing vowed, as upon another in&s;cription we have <HI>memoriam po&s;uit</HI> for <HI>monumentum;</HI> and upon another <HI>vo|tum fecit,</HI> which expre&s;&s;ion in the common &s;en&s;e is not to pay a vow, but to make it. And thus Virgil &s;eems to have u&s;ed the word <HI>votum,</HI> when he &s;ays

where the &s;ame thing is twice repeated in different words, and both <HI>equi</HI> and <HI>voto</HI> denote the wooden hor&s;e, which the Greeks pretended to con&s;ecrate to Pallas; <HI>votum pro redditu &s;imulant.</HI> This compliment is paid by Claudius Epaphroditus Claudianus, the tribune of the 1&s;t or 2d cohort of the <HI>Lingones.</HI> The 2d cohort of the&s;e people was in Britain, as appears from other in&s;criptions, and in Camden, a &s;maller <HI>I</HI> is &s;et before the other in this in&s;cription, &s;o as to make it plainly the &s;econd.

<P>MAR.T.I D AVG D AVFIDI VS AVFI DIANVS The judicious antiquary, Dr Hunter, of Durham, was &s;o obliging as to &s;end me the copy of the in&s;cription in the margin, which I &s;ound to be very exact when I com|pared it with the original. The Doctor &s;uppo&s;es it has been affixed to the face of an altar, and that the holes in the fir&s;t line have been for this purpo&s;e. The plate is of gold, but very thin, weighing ju&s;t two guineas, and the letters, which are very pecu|liar, are rai&s;ed by an impre&s;&s;ion made on the inner &s;ide by &s;ome proper in&s;trument. The plate is &s;o thin that in &s;ome places it is &s;truck quite through with the too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that has been u&s;ed for rai&s;ing the letters.

But as to this matter I &s;hall only refer to what has already been &s;aid in a parallel ca&s;e in Cumberland. The cut of the letters, particularly the <HI>G,</HI> looks like the lower empire; but I know no evidence whereby the particular emperor can be determined with any great probability. We have &s;everal other altars at this place, in&s;cribed al&s;o to Mars, which have been taken notice of before. I have only to add, that according to Dr Hunter's ac|count in his letter to me, <Q>This plate was found in the year 1716, in a heap of rubbi&s;h ca&s;t out to clear an old foundation without the fortification of the garri&s;on, a little &s;outh from the balneum.</Q> It is now in the chapter library at Durham.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 16, p. 291.</BIBL></P>
<P>N^o 6, plate. <HI>Legio vice&s;ima valens victrix fecit.</HI></P>
<P>The corona here is &s;upported by two winged victories, with the u&s;ual &s;ymbols and the u&s;ual drapery and attitude; the boar within may imply that it has been erected after &s;ome victory over the Caledonians by this legion. The &s;tone is broken quite through, but the letters notwith&s;tanding are very vi&s;ible, and none of them lo&s;t in the breach.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 16, p. 291.</BIBL></P>

<P>The name of the per&s;on who dedicated this is Caius Aurelius; but who he was I &s;uppo&s;e is unknown. This &s;mall altar has a <HI>patera</HI> on one &s;ide, and a <HI>praefericulum</HI> on the other.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 18, p. 292.</BIBL></P>

<P>N^o 10, plate. The&s;e three are all of them &s;mall altars, which have no vi&s;ible in&s;criptions upon them. They have, I believe, been publi&s;hed only by Mr Gordon. The fir&s;t has three female figures, which he very pro|bably &s;uppo&s;es to be &s;ome of the <HI>matres.</HI> The &s;econd has a toad on one &s;ide, and the u&s;ual &s;acrificing in&s;tru|ments on the other. I have only repre&s;ented that &s;ide with the toad, as being more curious. The third has a pediment &s;upported by two rude pilla&s;ters.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 20, p. 292.</BIBL></P>
<P>N^o 11, pl. This &s;mall altar, with the <HI>boar</HI> on the &s;ide, and the in&s;cription much effaced, is al&s;o ranked among the&s;e Lanche&s;ter in&s;criptions. Mr Ward &s;uppo&s;es this altar might be erected to the god <HI>Vitires,</HI> and that the letters <HI>Vit</HI> were upon the fir&s;t line, as we find them before; the &s;econd line is plainly <HI>votum,</HI> and the remain|ing letters upon the third line he thinks may be part of <HI>Solvit.</HI> This conjecture is favoured by another in|&s;cription of this county upon an altar dedicated to this deity, which has a boar upon one &s;ide: But I think it more likely that the latter part of the in&s;cription has been the name of the per&s;on erecting the altar: The la&s;t letters are ob&s;cure and doubtful.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e before mentioned, which are not at Durham, there are &s;ome curio&s;ities remaining yet in the &s;tation or town, and among the re&s;t a large &s;tone almo&s;t like a mortar. What u&s;e it has been for is hard to determine; &s;ome of the people call it a font, others who are more &s;killed, think it has been de&s;igned to hold water for the Roman lu&s;trations.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 21, p. 292.</BIBL></P>
<P>N^o 12, plate. <HI>Deo Marti Aci&mdash;.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;mall altar was in a &s;tone wall inclo&s;ing a field called Broomlawe near the &s;tation, belonging to Mr Rowland Wilkin&s;on, but I have now got it into my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The in&s;cription has &s;uffered very much by the weather. The remains of it look like <HI>Deo Marti;</HI> but it cannot now inform us by whom it was con|&s;ecrated, though the la&s;t vi&s;ible letters look like Acilius, a common Roman name, and which, I think, occurs in another of our in&s;criptions.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 24, p. 293.</BIBL></P>
<P>No. 13, plate. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>The capital of this altar and a &s;mall part of the in&s;cription is broken off and lo&s;t, and the want of it occa|&s;ions &s;ome difficulty as to the reading. When I fir&s;t &s;aw this &s;tone it was built up in the wall of an inclo&s;ure. I viewed it &s;everal times in this &s;ituation, but then nothing appearing but the imperfect Greek in&s;cription, the oppo&s;ite part of the &s;tone being entirely under cover, and built up within the wall. At fir&s;t view I concluded it to be Greek, but could di&s;cover no &s;atisfactory reading. When I had purcha&s;ed the &s;tone, and got it into
<PB N="362" REF="378">my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a Latin in&s;cription on the oppo&s;ite part of the altar. Which is the face and which the back of this altar, or whether like <HI>Janus bifrous,</HI> it was de&s;igned to be double faced, I &s;hall not pretend to determine. However to have in&s;criptions both before and behind is a &s;ingular curio&s;ity, of which I remember no parallel in&s;tance in Britain, unle&s;s the beautiful altar in Camberland be taken for &s;uch. But to have two &s;uch in&s;criptions in two different languages is yet more remarkable. Some &s;u&s;pect the Greek in&s;cription not to be genuine, or that it has been added by a different hand and at a different time from the Latin. But I &s;ee no ju&s;t rea&s;on to entertain this &s;u&s;picion, becau&s;e I cannot di&s;cern by whom or with what view it could have been added. So little was this altar regarded or valued, that according to the u&s;ual fate of &s;uch monuments, it was u&s;ed as a common &s;tone in the wall.</P>
<P>The high prices of curious Roman coins have produced a great many forgeries, contrived very artfully; but the little regard that has been had for monuments of &s;tone, renders us more &s;ecure of their being altoge|ther genuine. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion; the &s;ight of the Latin in&s;cription enabled me to read the remains of the Greek one, I humbly think, with great probability; for I take the greate&s;t part of the one to be much the &s;ame with the other, excepting the different language and character. I &s;hall therefore &s;peak to the Latin in&s;cription as being more ea&s;y and perfect.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor&s;ley,</HI> N^o 25, p. 293.</BIBL></P>
<P>N^o 14, plate. <HI>Ae&s;culapio Titus Flavius Titianus Tribunus votum &s;olvit libenti&s;&s;ime merito.</HI></P>
<P>It appears plainly from this, that the altar has been erected by one <HI>Titus Flavius Titianus,</HI> a tribune, but no cohort is mentioned which he commanded. There are &s;everal con&s;uls of the name <HI>Titianus,</HI> but the other name are different from that of our tribune. <HI>Tiberius Fabius Titianus</HI> appears five times in the Fa&s;ti, and at &s;uch a di&s;tance of time as to make it probable they were five different per&s;ons. This made me &s;u&s;picious that the <HI>T</HI> in our in&s;criptions was to be read <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and that the following name might be <HI>Fabius.</HI> But the <HI>Fl</HI> are &s;o di&s;tinct on the &s;tone as to leave no room for a doubt. I find <HI>Po&s;tumius Titianus</HI> was con&s;ul in the year 301, in the time of Diocletian and Maximian. And Almeloveen conjectures, that this may be the &s;ame with one who is called in Gruter <HI>T. Fl. Po&s;tumius Titianus.</HI> This comes neare&s;t the names of our tribune, but there is no arguing from hence with any probability that the&s;e two <HI>Titiani</HI> lived at or near the &s;ame time. But thus much for the per&s;on erecting this altar; the principal que&s;tion is, to whom it has been in&s;cribed? We have little to guide us in this but the letters <HI>Pio</HI> at the top, which are certain and di&s;tinct. I thought of <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> and other emperors, to whom living or dead, and deified, this epithet <HI>Pius</HI> has been applied, &s;uch as <HI>Divo Con&s;tantio Pio</HI> and others. Baron Clerk was &s;o obliging as to &s;end me &s;everal conjectures about this Latin in&s;cription, a copy of which I tran&s;mitted to him. Among other things, this very learned anti|quary &s;uppo&s;es, that <HI>Pio</HI> may be a part of <HI>Ae&s;culapio:</HI> This conjecture is more agreeable and &s;atisfactory than any thing that has occurred to my&s;elf, or been offered by any other. I think by the proportion of the altar, that there is not above one line of the in&s;cription wanting, which might be filled up with <HI>Ae&s;cula,</HI> or with <HI>Deo Ae&s;cula.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Greek in&s;cription, I believe it has &s;tood thus when entire,
<Q><P><GAP DESC="foreign"></P>
<P><HI>Pro &s;alute Titus Flavius Titianus Trib. Votum &s;olvit libenti&s;&s;ime merito.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, that there are five lines in the Greek in&s;cription, and but four remaining in the Latin, and that the &s;tone is rather higher on the &s;ide of the Greek in&s;cription than the other. This induces me to think that the imperfect remains at the top have been a part of the fir&s;t line of this in&s;cription. I need &s;ay nothing to &s;hew how &s;uitable this reading is to the remains on the &s;tone, and to the Latin in&s;cription on the other &s;ide. Both the one and the other, I think, appear at fir&s;t &s;ight. That there were &s;ome here in this part of the i&s;land, who were willing to pay regard to the gods who pre&s;ided over health and recovery, appears from the &s;culpture at Ri&s;ingham, in Northumberland. <GAP DESC="foreign"> is the Greek word that generally corre&s;ponds to <HI>Tribunus</HI> in Latin. In the New Te&s;tament <GAP DESC="foreign"> is rendered <HI>Tribunus,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>cohors</HI> by &s;everal. This is the &s;econd in&s;tance of the Greek character u&s;ed in &s;uch in&s;criptions in Britain; the other is the famous altar at Corbridge. No doubt they have been erected by &s;ome auxiliaries which came from Greece, or the neighbourhood of it, &s;uch as the Thracians, &amp;c. &s;ome cohorts of which were in Britain.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Hor.</HI> N^o 25. p. 263.</BIBL></P>

<P>When I fir&s;t &s;aw this &s;tone it was in the corner of a clo&s;e belonging to Nicholas Greenwell, not far from the former; the upper part was broken off and built up in the wall, and the in&s;cription covered, but upon re|moving it out of the wall, and comparing the two parts together. I perceived they had been originally united. I have &s;ince this got both the pieces into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;o have had an opportunity of placing them one upon another. When this was done they tallied with &s;o much exactne&s;s as to render it ab&s;olutely certain that they have originally made up one and the &s;ame altar. This altar is in&s;cribed to <HI>Jupiter optimus maximus,</HI> and has been erected, as I take, by the vexillation of an Eque&s;trian cohort, of the <HI>Varduli Cranei,</HI> people of Spain. The fir&s;t word in the &s;econd line mu&s;t, I think, have been <HI>Vexillatio,</HI> and the <HI>o</HI> perhaps has been a little one, and added near the top of the <HI>I,</HI> as we &s;ometimes find it. I once thought I di&s;cerned it there, but own my&s;elf jealous that my imagination a&s;&s;i&s;ted my eye &s;ight. The next word is plainly <HI>Cohors,</HI> but who the peo|ple have been of which this cohort con&s;i&s;ted mu&s;t be more di&s;tinctly con&s;idered. When I fir&s;t viewed the two pieces as they lay &s;eparate, I read the name <HI>Vardiorum.</HI> The&s;e are a people of Dalmatia, mentioned with &s;ome variation of the name by Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolomy, but &s;ince I got them home and put them together, I have found that by the largene&s;s of the interval there mu&s;t have been two letters between the <HI>D</HI> and <HI>O</HI> in the third line. I have al&s;o di&s;covered the &s;ure remains of a <HI>V</HI> after the <HI>D</HI> be&s;ides the imperfect letter before the <HI>O,</HI> I make no doubt therefore but the name is <HI>Vardulorum.</HI> The two fir&s;t letters in the fourth line of which there are any remains, &s;eem plainly to have been <HI>CR,</HI> which I would have concluded to have been the initial letters of the name <HI>Cranei,</HI> and to have been read <HI>Vardulorum, Craneorum,</HI> or <HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Craneorum</HI> if my fir&s;t conjecture concerning <HI>Craneis</HI> in the Riche&s;ter in&s;cription could have been &s;upported: But that being rejected, I am more at a lo&s;s for any probable reading of this part of the in&s;cription now before us. I would gladly &s;till make u&s;e of the one as a key to the other. And therefore if <HI>Con&s;ecraneis</HI> be read in the former, I am mo&s;t inclined to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>CR</HI> to be &s;ome part of an abbreviation of the &s;ame word in this. Po&s;&s;ibly it has been <HI>CSCR,</HI> which &s;upply &s;eems not un&s;uitable to the vacant &s;pace on the &s;tone, and perhaps <HI>ET</HI> has been at the end of the preceding line in letters of the &s;ame &s;ize; thus it would be <HI>Fardulorum et Con&s;ecraneorum</HI> in this as <HI>Vardulorum cum Con&s;ecraneis</HI> in the other. <HI>EQ</HI> in this fourth line is no doubt for <HI>Eque&s;tris</HI> or <HI>Equitum.</HI> The character at the end of this line is much the &s;ame with an <HI>M</HI> that is u&s;ed for <HI>Mille</HI> in one of the in&s;criptions of Gla&s;gow, but that it here &s;ignifies 1000 hor&s;e is more than I dare venture to affirm.

<P>I confe&s;s your letter has &s;hocked my a&s;&s;urance, though I &s;till hope my conjecture will not be quite over|thrown. <HI>Gravij, Graij,</HI> or <HI>Granij,</HI> as I think it is &s;ometimes written, are people not far from the <HI>Varduli,</HI> mentioned by Pliny and others. The&s;e were the people I meant and thought of. The change from <HI>Granei</HI> to <HI>Cranei</HI> is very ea&s;y, the word <HI>con&s;ecranei</HI> no where occurs in in&s;criptions, and no evidence of its being u&s;ed till after the time of this in&s;cription: But I only &s;end this to beg excu&s;e for the delay, till I re|turn home, when I &s;hall examine the Rieche&s;ter &s;tone.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Extract of a letter from Dr Hunter, of Durham, to Roger Gale, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> dated</HI> 17 <HI>May,</HI> 1735.</HEAD>
<P>I have had the happine&s;s to meet with the&s;e two altars found lately at Lanche&s;ter, in the Roman &s;ta|tion; the fir&s;t within the ancient fortification, having its bottom broken off, and the initial letters of the la&s;t two lines. That of the la&s;t has undoubtedly been a <HI>D.</HI> The other was found in the next ground near the remains of the baths.</P>
<P>N^o 17, plate. 1. <HI>Numini Augu&s;ti et Genio cohortis &s;ecundae Vardulorum Gregalium Equitum Millenario|rum "&s;ub Anti&s;to Advento Legionis Augu&s;tae propraetore (fecto) F. Tirannus. Tribunus Dedicatq. revertenier rite.</HI> 2. <HI>Deo Marti Sancidus lubenti animo.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, with two portable altars, without any in&s;criptions, and a figure of Ceres, are pre&s;ented to the wor&s;hipful James Clavering, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who, in re&s;pect to &s;uch valuable antiquities, intends to entertain them in the avenues of his beautiful garden at Greencroft, about a mile di&s;tant from Lanche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Pliny is the only author we can gather any thing from remarkable concerning the Varduli, and that &s;o very conci&s;e, I think de&s;erves a place here. In conventum Clunien&s;em Varduli ducant populos xiv. ex quibus Albanen&s;es tantum nominare libeat. Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. iii. c. 3. &s;ect. 4, of the la&s;t Paris edition; and in lib. iv. c. 20, &s;ect. 34, he enumerates the <HI>Vardulorum Oppida, Moro&s;gi, Meno&s;ca, Ve&s;peries Amanum Por|tus ubi nunc Flaviobriga Colonia,</HI> where Mr Hardoiun recites the modern names. And as Gruter's almo&s;t infinite collection affords no in&s;cription where the <HI>Varduli</HI> are named, I pre&s;ume the Roman oeconomy un|der the emperor Trajan, by de&s;cent a Spaniard, if not &s;ooner, had aboli&s;hed the old di&s;tinctions of &s;epa|rate governments, and reduced the whole province under one general name, Hi&s;pania, which afterwards the Notitia Imperij occidentalis divides into three con&s;ular provinces, under the direction of four pre&s;i|dents, viz. Farraconenis, Carthagineus Tingitania, In&s;ula Balearium, and places no garri&s;on of the Varduli in any fortre&s;s in the ea&s;tern or we&s;tern empire.</P>
<P>The in&s;cription upon the fir&s;t is cut very fair. In comparing my copy with Mr Hor&s;ley's altar, N^o 26, Durham, belonging al&s;o to Lanche&s;ter, which is at pre&s;ent in the dean and chapter's library here, I ob|&s;erve a difference between the fir&s;t letter of the fourth line, where <HI>C</HI> is very apparent: If my copy is true, I hope my reading may be allowed. The figure I call a Ceres is well cut; the left hand leaning upon a globe, which I take to be a <HI>Lapis Molaris,</HI> prompts me to term it &s;o. One of the &s;mall altars has a toad upon the &s;ide, the &s;ame as one of the three mentioned by Mr Hor&s;ley in our library.</P>

<HEAD><HI>An&s;wer to the preceding letter by R. Gale, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> dated London,</HI> 7 <HI>June,</HI> 1735.</HEAD>
<P>As for the two in&s;criptions you &s;ent me, I will venture to give my thoughts upon them, &amp;c. The fir&s;t of them is very curious, as it gives us the name of a <HI>Legatus Augu&s;talis</HI> and propraetor hitherto unknown in Britain, and which ought, as I think, to be read as follows, <HI>Numini Augu&s;ti &amp; genio cohortis &s;ecundae Vor|dulorum

Tiranus Tribunus dat dedicat|que rite.</HI> To read <HI>GR</HI> in the fourth line, <HI>Gregalium,</HI> is not a little doubtful: It cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an altar to the deity of the emperor, and at the &s;ame time to the genius of the common &s;oldiers, exclu&s;ive of the genius of the officers, of which he him&s;elf was one; and how to read it otherwi&s;e is as uncertain, if the letters are <HI>GR,</HI> as in your copy. But if they are <HI>CR,</HI> as on the altar given us by Mr Hor&s;ley, Durham, N^o 26, in his Brit. Rom. and which you &s;ay has <HI>C</HI> very ap|parent in&s;tead of <HI>G,</HI> they may denote <HI>civium Romanorum,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Varduli</HI> people of Spain, and admitted to the freedom of the city of Rome for &s;ome extraordinary merit, or by &s;ome emperor's &s;avour, perhaps their countryman Trajan's. This was a privilege frequently conferred upon foreigners, even whole towns and nations, and at la&s;t communicated by Antoninus Pius <HI>omnibus in commune &s;ubjectis,</HI> by which it &s;eems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that emperor; for it is no great honour or ad|vantage for the&s;e <HI>Varduli</HI> to value them&s;elves upon, if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the re&s;t of the world. Mon&s;. Spanheim ob&s;erves, <HI>Exercit. prima ad con&s;titution. Imp. Antonini de civ. Rom. quod &s;ub. M. Antonino Imp. civitate donati e&s;&s;ent quicunque in Romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti e&s;&s;ent milites ut prae&s;idarij in imperij limitibus con&s;tituerentur.</HI> This &s;eems contradictory to the fir&s;t mentioned grant, &s;ince it only confers the freedom of the city upon the &s;oldiers in garri&s;on on the frontiers of the empire, and the other gives it to all the &s;ubjects of the Roman empire without exception. Perhaps the &s;oldiers had this ad|vantage given them at fir&s;t, and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered, it was thought advi&s;eable to admit all the &s;ubjects of the empire to the &s;ame privilege, to intere&s;t them the more in pre&s;erving the whole from the attacks of the barbarians: But there has been no &s;mall uncertainty among the learned to which of the Antonins this con&s;titution is owing, &s;ome attri|buting it to Antoninus Pius, others to Marcus Aurelius, and Mr Spanheim with great rea&s;on to Antoninus Caracalla, from Dion Ca&s;&s;ius chiefly, who tells us this privilege was granted to him <HI>omnibus qui in urbe Ro|mano erant,</HI> not &s;o much for the honour and advantage of it to the people, as for the filling his trea&s;ury, &s;ince it made them liable to the payment of &s;everal taxes, from which they were before exempted; &s;o that the &s;oldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their &s;ervices, and the re&s;t of the people afterwards mo&s;t likely to drain their pur&s;es. In Gruter's The&s;aur. p. 455, 6, is mentioned <HI>Tanti&s;tius praefectus alae &s;ulpiciae C. R. i. e. Civium Romanorum:</HI> And in p. 459, 8, <HI>L. Prae&s;entius praefectus cob.</HI> 1. <HI>Afr.

<P>A <HI>cohors Equitata</HI> was compo&s;ed partly of hor&s;e, partly of foot, as Vegetius informs us, lib. ii. cha. 2. <HI>Prima cohors habet pedites mille centum &amp; quinque; Equites loricatos centum triginta duos et appellantur mil|liaria.</HI> I mu&s;t own the cohors in this in&s;cription is called <HI>&s;ecunda Vardulorum,</HI> of which an in&s;cription was found at Rieche&s;ter, in Northumberland.&mdash;[See Hor&s;ley's Brit. Rom. North. 94.] This &s;econd <HI>cohors</HI> of the <HI>Varduli</HI> might however be the <HI>prima auxiliaria</HI> of &s;ome legion, perhaps the &s;ixth, and in more e&s;teem for &s;ome eminent &s;ervice or fortunate accident than the fir&s;t, not dignified with the honourable title and privileges <HI>civium Romanorum,</HI> perhaps al&s;o independent of any legion. And after all, the &s;ole rea&s;on why one of the cohorts was called the fir&s;t, and the other the &s;econd, might have been from the priority of time when they were fir&s;t rai&s;ed.

<HEAD><HI>Extract of a letter from Sir John Clerk, touching the above, dated from Pennycuik,</HI> 26 <HI>June,</HI> 1735.</HEAD>
<P>There were many barbarities in the language of the lower empire, and therefore it is hard to determine with any certainty about letters. I cannot approve of the doctor's <HI>Gregalium,</HI> though I believe he would be va&s;tly &s;ond of it, and plea&s;ed with the invention. Your <HI>Civium Romanorum</HI> is certainly right, if the

You will be &s;urpri&s;ed at my notion of <HI>Germanicorum,</HI> if I do not explain to you the reading of the altar &s;o as to comprehend &s;uch a word. If the letters are <HI>G.

<P>This mu&s;t have been the figure of the godde&s;s Fortune &s;eated, the wheel that is by her &s;ide, and the cornucopia &s;he has in her left hand, and the globe at her foot on the other &s;ide, do all &s;hew it to be Fortune, though one of her arms, as well as her head; be now broken off. There are &s;everal altars at Durham in&s;crib|ed to Fortune; one found at Lanche&s;ter in&s;cribed <HI>Fortunae Au|gu&s;ti;</HI> perhaps this has been the image of that Fortune; and by this image with the globe at her feet, may be expre&s;&s;ed the em|peror's univer&s;al dominion. The modern letters that are now cut on the ba&s;e, may ea&s;ily, at fir&s;t view, deceive one into an opinion that the image is not Roman or antique; but this only &s;hews when it was found, and by whom, namely in the year 1700, by Henry Orn&s;by, of Lanche&s;ter, who&s;e wife's name was Elizabeth. To di&s;gui&s;e this figure further, there &s;tands on it a Mercury's head, as is plain from the peta&s;us, &s;o that I look upon it as certain that the head and body have belonged to different figures, though now the one is generally &s;et upon the other.&mdash; This image of Fortune I take to be the &s;ame with a figure in Mr Gordon, which I can find no where explained. He has made the proportion far too large for the re&s;t of the figures, and po&s;|&s;ibly had forgot the dimen&s;ions.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This figure, about twenty-four inches in height, remains in the dean and chapter's library at Durham, and the proper head is to be &s;een there: The &s;culpture is uncommonly good, and we prefer cutting the repre&s;entation from a drawing made in 1776, to a mere imitation of Mr. Hor&s;ley's plate.</P>
<P><Q>This repre&s;ents a curious &s;culpture which is on a &s;tone built up in the ve&s;try wall of the church. It is much like that at Netherby, though there is &s;ome difference in the drapery, and here is no corona on the head, but only the hair plaited. I believe this to be a genius as well as the other, or at lea&s;t the emperor repre&s;ented as &s;uch.</Q></P>
<PB N="358" REF="374"></NOTE> the fir&s;t name of this town has been <HI>Glanche&s;ter,</HI> com|po&s;ed as u&s;ual of the fir&s;t &s;yllable of the old Roman name, with the word <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> annexed to it: The <HI>G,</HI> for the &s;ake of an ea&s;ier pronunciation, might be dropt. If <HI>Glanoventa</HI> &s;ignifies a bank, or hill near a river, <HI>ven</HI> or <HI>vent</HI> in the Briti&s;h tongue &s;ignifying a river, the &s;ituation of the &s;tation at Lanche&s;ter is not un|&s;uitable to this etymology; for it &s;tands on high ground, with a river on one &s;ide, and a rivulet on the other, and not far from either. I know two of our greate&s;t modern antiquaries, Roger Gale, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and Dr Hunter, of Durham, &s;uppo&s;e Lanche&s;ter to be the ancient <HI>Longovicus,</HI> the affinity of name having, as I pre&s;ume, inclined them to this opinion; but I have a pretty &s;trong rea&s;on to
<PB N="359" REF="375">
offer why this cannot be the <HI>Longovicus</HI> in the Notitia, garri&s;oned by the <HI>Numerus Longovicariorum,</HI> which is this: It is evident that &s;ome order is ob&s;erved in the
<PB N="360" REF="376">
Notitia in &s;etting down the &s;everal places, and <HI>Longovicus</HI> is &s;et among the mo&s;t &s;outherly that were under the <HI>Dux Britanniarum;</HI> it is put down as more to the
<PB N="361" REF="377">
&s;outh than <HI>Lavatrae</HI> or <HI>Verterae,</HI> and next to <HI>Derventio,</HI> all which are mentioned in the Notitia as well as the Itinerary; and this &s;uits much better with the &s;itua|tion
<PB N="362" REF="378">
of Lanca&s;ter in Lanca&s;hire, than Lanche&s;ter in the county of Durham; and as none of the military ways on which any of the itinera proceed &s;eem to have
<PB N="363" REF="379">
pa&s;&s;ed by Lanche&s;ter, &s;o this may be a good rea&s;on why <HI>Longovicus</HI> is not men|tioned in the Itinerary, though we have it in the Notitia. Upon the whole,
<PB N="364" REF="380">
therefore, I &s;ee no place bids &s;o fair to be the <HI>Glanoventa</HI> in the Itinerary as Lanche&s;ter, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider how the re&s;t of the iter goes on when this foundation is laid.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="381"><Q>The &s;tation and town have been &s;ituated on a lingula between the river Browney and the rivulet Smallup. This rivulet runs into the Browney a little
<PB N="366" REF="382">
below the &s;tation, and Browney lo&s;es it&s;elf and name in the river Were, at Sun|derland bridge, two miles &s;outh of Durham. The &s;tation is two furlongs di&s;|tant from Smallup, and not &s;o much from Browney. It has a high &s;ituation, and yet the pro&s;pect is bounded quite round about with hills or ri&s;ing grounds,
<PB N="367" REF="383">
that are not at a very great di&s;tance. The &s;ame &s;ort of &s;ituation is ob&s;ervable at El&s;don, in Northumberland, and &s;everal other places. This &s;ituation has this advantage, that an enemy could not come over the&s;e ri&s;ing grounds, but they mu&s;t immediately appear to the garri&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Hor&s;ley has delineated this &s;tation of an exact &s;quare figure, whereas it is oblong, one hundred and &s;eventy-four paces from north to &s;outh, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t one hundred and &s;ixty within the wall. It had &s;urvived many ages le&s;s mutilat|ed than any &s;tructure of the kind, in the northern counties, but of late many of the &s;tones have been removed to inclo&s;e the adjacent lands, and make the roads; and the proprietor is regularly de&s;troying this piece of antiquity. In &s;ome parts the wall yet remains almo&s;t perfect; the out&s;ide is perpendicular, twelve feet in height, built of a&s;hler work, in regular cour&s;es, each &s;tone being about nine inches deep and twelve long: By &s;ome large &s;tones which lie near the foot of the wall, it is evident there was a parapet, with a walk near three feet wide at the top. At the we&s;t entrance a &s;tone, as repre&s;ented in the cut, was lately dug up, from which
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the drawing was made in 1783, and &s;hews that &s;uch fortifications had more orna|ment than is commonly apprehended: The in&s;ide of the vallum is built of a&s;hler work, but from the ground work upwards, at the di&s;tance of about twenty inches, it dimini&s;hes gradually in thickne&s;s, in &s;teps running parallel through the whole &s;tructure, by which tho&s;e within might a&s;cend the wall, and in&s;tantly line the para|pet with troops on the approach of an enemy. The wall where broken through is eight feet thick at the pre&s;ent &s;urface, dimini&s;hing to &s;omewhat more than four at the top; the interior part between the facings is formed of thin &s;tones, placed inclining, feather-wi&s;e, tier above tier, run full of mortar mixed with rough gravel. What is remarkable, there appear no <HI>throughs,</HI> as the ma&s;ons call tho&s;e &s;tones which bind the buildings by going through from face to face, or into the heart of the wall. There was an entrance in the center of each &s;ide of the &s;quare, and to the we&s;t a wide ditch; the ground has been cultivated many years on the other &s;ides, as well as within the vallum. We did not di&s;cern any in&s;cription on the walls &s;ave L. xxxv.

<P>The la&s;t time we vi&s;ited this &s;tation, in Augu&s;t 1783, we di&s;covered at a gate on the we&s;t &s;ide of the road, the pillar repre&s;ented, which it is pre&s;umed &s;tood on the

<P>An exten&s;ive divi&s;ion of common lands within this pari&s;h took place by virtue of an act of parliament, in the twelfth year of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, on which, it was computed, twenty thou&s;and acres were to be inclo&s;ed. The commi&s;&s;ioners were impowered to di&s;po&s;e of lands, to rai&s;e money for making all the roads, and paying expences; for which purpo&s;e they &s;old one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-one acres for 8174l. or there|abouts, and three hundred acres were &s;et out and ve&s;t|ed in the ju&s;tices of the peace of the county, for rai&s;ing money to compen&s;ate the owners of allotments, &s;uch damages as they &s;hould &s;u&s;tain by the lord bi&s;hop of Durham, or his le&s;&s;ees, winning mines therein: But being afterwards con&s;idered, that it would be more expedient to &s;ell an allotment of three hundred acres, &s;ubject to a rent charge of 30l. a year, an act of parliament was obtained to carry &s;uch &s;ale into effect, and Thomas White, of Retford, in the county of Nottingham, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> be|came
<PB N="369" REF="385">
the purcha&s;er. He &s;et a mo&s;t laudable example on this divi&s;ion, and planted two hundred and eleven acres with fore&s;t trees, and &s;ixteen acres with fruit trees, which, under the &s;helter of ri&s;ing plantations, promi&s;e to an&s;wer the adventurer's expectations. Of the three hundred acres purcha&s;ed, Mr White has planted one hundred and fifty acres more with fore&s;t trees. This va&s;t tract of country, which was barren, de&s;art, and dreary, where the perplexed traveller wandered in the am|biguous tracks with anxiety, is now inclo&s;ed, much of it cultivated, and inter&s;ected with direct roads, made in the turnpike manner, fit for the reception of any car|riage; innumerable buildings are &s;cattered over the pro&s;pect; merchandi&s;e has found an expeditious pa&s;&s;age to villages heretofore almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, but in the very mid&s;t of &s;ummer; and the inhabitants, greatly multiplied, are chearful and pro&s;perous. In one farmhold, totally &s;eparated from all ancient inclo&s;ures, in the &s;ummer of 1783, we ob&s;erved thirty-four &s;tacks of corn in one yard, the produce of new cultivations. Many parts lie very high, the pro&s;pect con&s;equently exten|&s;ive: At a point where the roads leading to Durham, Hexham, Che&s;ter, and Lan|che&s;ter meet, the view is noble, and commands a va&s;t extent of country, even to the mouths of the rivers Tyne, Were, and Tees, be&s;ides a di&s;tant pro&s;pect to the we&s;t and north.</P>

Bi&s;hop Eardulph, who was the eighteenth prelate of the church of Lindisfarn, fly|ing with the remains of St Cuthbert before the barbarians who made their &s;acrile|gious de&s;cent on that i&s;land, not &s;ettling at Crake, where he &s;at down for a time, re&s;ted at Che&s;ter, and there began to build a church about the year 883; and the religious body retained this re&s;idence till the year 995, when they re&s;ted at Dur|ham. Tanner &s;ays, the See removed hither "had probably a chapter of monks, or rather &s;ecular canons attending it."&mdash;Che&s;ter entertained the &s;ame re|ligious &s;ociety that exi&s;ted at Lindisfarn, and they were again tran&s;lated to Dur|ham, &s;o it is pretty certain there was no e&s;tabli&s;hment of monks here, but of &s;eculars. Egelric, the fourth bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, was induced to take down the humble building of wood which his predece&s;&s;or erected for his epi&s;copal church,

and rai&s;ed one more magnificent: Finding great trea&s;ures, he conveyed the &s;ame out of his bi&s;hopric to enrich the mona&s;tery of Peterborough, from whence he came: We have already offered conjectures on this trea&s;ure-trove, and therefore &s;hall not dwell on it here. On the introduction of canons regular into the cathe|dral church of Durham, Che&s;ter, it is &s;aid, was one of the churches appointed to receive the &s;eculars, who, without having committed offence, were removed from the &s;eat of dignity, and no doubt were provided for in the mo&s;t ample manner.</P>

<P><Q>WE do ordain, &amp;c.

And to the intent he may better bear and undergo the premi&s;&s;es, we will and firmly ordain, that to the deanry &s;hall be totally a&s;&s;igned and annexed the revenues as well in the church of Che&s;ter, as in the chapels afore&s;aid, (Tanfield and Lame&s;ley) to wit, of mortuaries, wool, lamb, milk, calves, hay, lint, hemp, hens, gee&s;e, pigs, and of all minute tithes and per&s;onal tithes, together with the rent and court of the te|nants of the church and the town of Che&s;ter, and of Waldridge, and the whole dominical land of Herver|ton.

It is a hand&s;ome edifice of &s;tone, covered with lead; the tower from the foundation is &s;quare, but when it ri&s;es above the roof, takes an octagonal form, and in this part is apparently much more modern; it is fini&s;hed with a mo&s;t elegant &s;tone &s;pire, one of the fine&s;t in the north of England, being in the whole one hundred and fifty-&s;ix feet in height: The accurate plate will &s;ave much de&s;cription. The whole length of this building on the out&s;ide is fifty-four paces. The church within is of a regular form, having two &s;ide ailes, &s;eparated from the nave by five pointed arches &s;upported on pillars, two of which towards the ea&s;t in each row are light and round, but the third, an odd conceit in the architect, is formed of two cylin|ders put together, the broad &s;ides facing the nave and ailes: The nave is in length from the foot of the tower thirty paces, and in width, including the ailes, from the north door to the &s;outh, fifteen paces: The pulpit is placed again&s;t the center pillar in the &s;outh row; the &s;ounding board heavy with rude carving. The whole church is decently &s;talled, and kept clean; the pavement is new; there is a hand&s;ome white marble font, and a gallery at the we&s;t end: The &s;outh aile is lighted with three regular windows of three lights each, under pointed arches; in the ea&s;tern one are two coats of arms. The chancel has been altered in modern times, and is only &s;ix paces wide by eleven long; the arch which &s;eparates it is &s;upported on light brackets, and the &s;talls are without much ornament. There are four windows to the &s;outh, and a large modern-&s;a&s;h to the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The north aile, which now is &s;olely appropriated to and filled with a line of tombs of the Lumley family, has anciently been further extended, three arches and two columns appearing in the out&s;ide wall, as if &s;ome &s;mall cloi&s;ter formerly lay contiguous to the church: The windows di&s;cover the alteration, which per|haps was made when the tombs were placed, for there are three &s;quare windows within the old arches, and a window under a pointed arch beyond them.

Before we &s;peak of the monuments, it mu&s;t be noted, that bi&s;hop Matthew granted licence in 1594, authorizing John baron of Lumley, to tran&s;late hither the re|mains and monuments of his ance&s;tors, particularly of John Lumley, and Ralph Lumley, from the yard of the cathedral church at Durham, where they were placed near the north door<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Regi&s;tr.

<P>This &s;olemn arrangement of effigies, this aile of death, cannot be vi&s;ited with|out &s;ome emotion by tho&s;e who know the family, de&s;cended of an illu&s;trious race of ance&s;try, or have traced their hi&s;tory and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The genealogical table which attends the de&s;cription of Lumley ca&s;tle will &s;ave a tedious rehear&s;al of mo|numental in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t effigy at the foot or we&s;t end of the aile, is by an in&s;cription on the wall, noted to appertain to Liulphus, that unhappy mini&s;ter of Walcher bi&s;hop of Durham, who provoked the ma&s;&s;acre at Gate&s;head church: The figure is cut in &s;tone, but much mutilated, having lo&s;t the feet; the right hand is extended, gra&s;p|ing the &s;word, as in the action of drawing the weapon; the legs are &s;traight. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to note why &s;uch different attitudes had acceptance in monumen|tal effigies. Per&s;ons who died in battle on the victorious &s;ide, were repre&s;ented with the helmet on the head, the &s;hield on the le&s;t, and the &s;word on the dexter &s;ide, naked, and with the point upwards. Tho&s;e who died in battle on the van|qui&s;hed &s;ide, were repre&s;ented on their tombs without their coat over their armour, with their feet re&s;ting on a dead lion, having their hands joined on their brea&s;t, the vi&s;or lifted up, and the &s;word in the &s;heath. Tho&s;e who died pri&s;oners were re|pre&s;ented without helmet, &s;word or &s;pur. One who had &s;erved a great part of his life in the army, and afterwards became a religious per&s;on, was repre&s;ented up|wards in the habit of the order he profe&s;&s;ed, and below in complete armour. A gentleman or knight, who had been killed or vanqui&s;hed in &s;ingle combat, was re|pre&s;ented in compleat armour, his battle ax out of his arms, lying by him, and his left arm acro&s;s his right. If he had been victorious, he was repre&s;ented armed on all points, with his right arm acro&s;s over the left, and his battle ax in his arms. The &s;on of a general, or governor of a ca&s;tle or fortified city, if he died when the place was be&s;ieged, was pourtrayed in complete armour, with his head re&s;ting on an helmet in&s;tead of a pillow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Barley's Diction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;econd effigy, <HI>Utredus filius Liulphi,</HI> cut in &s;tone, his head, &s;houlders, and arms covered with a coat of mail of chain work, the legs of the &s;ame, the right hand gra&s;ping the &s;word hilt in the action of drawing the weapon.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>William de Lumley,</HI> accoutred the &s;ame as the la&s;t; a parrot held by the tail in the right hand, the legs cro&s;&s;ed, the right foot uppermo&s;t, the feet re&s;ted on a lion couchant&mdash;an elegant figure; the folds of the ve&s;t &s;kirts ea&s;y and finely di&s;po&s;ed.

This per&s;onage was knighted by king Edward IV. He was &s;heriff of Northumberland in the &s;econd and third years of that reign; an office then not only of great tru&s;t and authority, but of va&s;t emolument, for no account was made to the king's ex|chequer till the third year of king Edward VI. but the i&s;&s;ues and profits of the bailiwic were appropriated to the &s;heriffs proper benefit, with all debts, fines, and amerciaments, emoluments accruing from alienations, intru&s;ions, wards, marriages, reliefs, &amp;c. the intention of which appropriation was to reward their diligence in protecting the borders again&s;t the Scots, and for that purpo&s;e to keep &s;ufficient guards in pay. But that duty being le&s;&s;ened by the appointment of wardens of the marches, in the third year of king Edward VI. it was enacted, that the &s;heriffs of Northumberland &s;hould thenceforth like others account to the exchequer.

In the twentieth year he was in the duke of Glouce&s;ter's army, at the taking of Berwick, having a great command in that expedition, and in the rolls of the troops is called lord Lumley: He was one that entered Edinburgh at the head of the forces, and with lord Fitz Hugh, the lord Scrope of Ma&s;&s;am, and others, was made a knight banneret in Hooton-field, as a te&s;timony of approved gallantry. On the acce&s;&s;ion of king Henry VII. he attend|ed the king in his northern progre&s;s. In the thirteenth year of king Henry VII. he &s;erved in lord Surrey's army, when they rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Norham ca&s;tle, where the king of Scots lay in per&s;on; and from thence penetrating into Scotland, made a diver&s;ion, and de&s;troyed &s;ome con&s;iderable fortre&s;&s;es in &s;ight of the Scotch army. On the e&s;pou&s;als of the prince&s;s Margaret of England with James king of Scotland, 1502, he, with his &s;on and their retinue, accompanied by eighty hor&s;emen in their train, apparelled in the family liveries, met the queen at Darlington and at|tended her to Berwick. He married one of the daughters of Roger Thornton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> a merchant at Newca&s;tle, by whom he got a large fortune, and among other po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions the manors of Witton in Northumberland, Ludworth and the I&s;le, in this county.

This per&s;onage, in the fifth year of king Henry VIII. on the Scotch inva&s;ion, joined the earl of Surrey with a large force, and was one of the principal commanders of the van guard of the Engli&s;h army at the battle of Flodden Field: It is mentioned by &s;everal hi&s;torians, that this van guard &s;hewed great bravery in the engagement, and were victorious over that body of the enemy commanded by the earls of Crawford and Montro&s;s, who both fell in the field. In the following year he was &s;ummoned to parliament, and in the year 1520, he was pre&s;ent at the interview the king had with the emperor Charles V. at Canterbury, and that with the king of France near Ardres: He &s;erved under the earl of Shrew&s;bury in the Scotch expe|ditions; and in the twenty-fir&s;t of the reign, had &s;ummons to that parliament which exi&s;ted five years by prorogations, and &s;truck the fir&s;t blow in the di&s;&s;olution of religious hou&s;es: He was in the combination that encouraged the king to the divorce of queen Catharine; and at la&s;t fell from his loyalty, and joined the nor|thern confederates in the pilgrimage of grace, but accepted the terms of the duke of Norfolk's proclamation. His &s;on George fell into other broils, and was one of the partizans of the lord Darcy, was apprehended and committed to the Tower, and &s;oon after &s;uffered death. John the &s;on of George Lumley, at the death of his grandfather, was an infant under age; and in the fir&s;t year of king Edward VI. on his petition was re&s;tored in blood, as &s;on and heir of George, and cou&s;in and heir of John, then late lord Lumley, but &s;undry parts of the e&s;tate were &s;evered from the family, the act of re&s;toration not repealing the attainder of his father.</P>

The&s;e fells have been very much worked for iron &s;tone (&s;up|po&s;ed by the Danes, when they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this kingdom) as appears from the great quantity of &s;coria or cinder which is found upon the fells and extends many miles we&s;tward. The method in tho&s;e times had been to melt the iron &s;tone with charcoal in a large &s;mithy hearth, called a bloomery, and then in another hearth to melt it down again and reduce it to bar iron for all manner of country u&s;es: And when the wood failed they removed their hearths to where was more plenty, &s;o that evidently they mu&s;t have blown their bloomery bellows either by hand or with hor&s;es, or have known the u&s;e of air furnaces, as the mo&s;t &s;coria or cinder is found upon the high grounds, where no water could be obtained. About three miles we&s;t of Che&s;ter is a place called the Old Furnace, where very lately was to be &s;een the bottom of a furnace hearth, according to the u&s;ual method of building them now, but of much &s;maller dimen&s;ions: They had blown the bellows with a water wheel, as appears by the cut of a water race to convey it to the wheel from an upper part of the burne. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the burne is a place called the Allum Well, from the water having a &s;trong aluminous &s;mell and ta&s;te.

The chief improvement of this country is attributed to cardinal Langley, who di&s;|fore&s;ted the lands, and licenced their being inclo&s;ed and brought into tillage.</P>
<P>As this manor appertained to the bi&s;hop, we mu&s;t naturally conclude there were few free tenants therein: In the fifth year of bi&s;hop Hatfield, Will. de Birtley died &s;ei&s;ed of a me&s;&s;uage and thirty acres of land here, held by homage, fealty, and fif|teen &s;hillings rent; and Ra. Clerk, in the &s;eventh year of the &s;ame prelate, died &s;ei&s;ed of twenty-&s;ix acres of land, held by fealty and ten &s;hillings rent, and &s;ixty acres of wood, by fealty and rendering two arrows; and they are the only free tenants we have met with noted in the ancient records.</P>
<P>Camden apprehended Che&s;ter was the <HI>Condercum</HI> of the Romans: Dr Stukeley, in his Iter-boreale, 1725, &s;ays, <Q>The Hermen &s;treet is very plain, being a &s;traight line hither when we de&s;cend from Gate&s;head fell: I think Bede mentions this &s;tation, as called Conce&s;ter, which retains part of the Roman name. Great coal works too hereabouts. The fir&s;t wing of the A&s;tures made this their garri&s;on, as the Notitia tells us, being <HI>ad lineam valli;</HI> for though it be not upon the wall, it is rea&s;onable to think his expre&s;&s;ion is not to be &s;trictly taken; it was convenient that &s;ome of the forces that guarded the wall &s;hould be quartered at &s;ome &s;uit|able di&s;tance, that they might have room of country for their maintenance.</Q> No in&s;criptions or other Roman remains have been di&s;covered here; and the name of Che&s;ter-on-the-Street derived from its &s;ituation on the Roman way, has hither|to been all that led the antiquaries to conceive it was of Roman origin. It is pro|bable, as Dr Stukeley ob&s;erves, &s;ome troops were &s;tationed at a di&s;tance from the wall; perhaps they lined the great roads at intervals with &s;mall detachments; and this is &s;till more probable, if we admit they knew any thing of pit coal for fuel. But we defer &s;peaking on that till we advance to the banks of Tyne.</P>

<P>is the next place of ob&s;ervation. This ca&s;tle, one of the &s;eats of lord Scar|borough, &s;tands on a fine elevated &s;ituation, ornamented with beautiful planta|tions; the lands ri&s;e gradually from the channel of the river Were on the &s;outh and we&s;t &s;ides; and on the north is the rivulet called Lumley beck: The ea&s;t front of the ca&s;tle &s;tands immediately on the brink of a very deep valley, full of wood, through which the brook winds towards the Were. The form of this edifice is &s;quare, having a projecting tower at each angle, and a court or area in the center: The corners of each tower are guarded with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tre&s;&s;es, crowned with a &s;mall turret or ob&s;ervatory; what is &s;ingular in the turrets is, that they are oc|tangular, &s;o that they overhang the face of each &s;quare of the ba&s;e, and are machi|colated or open for the purpo&s;e of annoying a&s;&s;ailants by ca&s;ting down &s;tones, &amp;c. which gives the edifice a &s;ingular appearance: The ca&s;tle is built of a yellow free-&s;tone, which makes it look bright and beautiful at a di&s;tance. The chief entrance is at the we&s;t front, by a double &s;light of &s;teps, and a platform, which fills the whole &s;pace between the tower; the &s;outh front is modern, and brought forward almo&s;t parallel with the tower, &s;ixty-five paces in length; the north front is ob|&s;cured
<PB N="400" REF="421">
by offices; and the ea&s;t front retains its ancient form: There is a gateway in the center of the ea&s;t front, which projects and is guarded by &s;quare turrets at the angles, with ob&s;ervatories as before de&s;cribed; above the gate is a gallery formed in the arch, with apertures to annoy an enemy: Above this gate are &s;ix &s;hields of arms boldly cut in &s;tone, with their &s;everal cre&s;ts, cotemporary with the building, and which critically give us the date of it.</P>
<P>The arrangement of the arms is as follows: In the center, and elevated above the re&s;t, are the arms of France and England quarterly, being, as we pre&s;ume, the arms of king Richard II. as in that reign Sir Ralph Lumley obtained licence from bi&s;hop Skirlaw, dated 1389, to ca&s;tellate his hou&s;e of Lumley; and the architec|ture of this front is a grand model of the ta&s;te of that age: The act of Richard II. mentioned by Mr Pennant, had been intru&s;ional or merely confirmatory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>It is &s;aid to have been built in the time of Edward I. by Sir Robert de Lumley, and enlarged by his &s;on Sir Marmaduke. Prior to that the family re&s;idence was at Lumley, (from whence it took the name) a village a mile &s;outh of the ca&s;tle, where are remains of a very old hall hou&s;e, that boa&s;ts a greater anti|quity.

There are three &s;tories of apartments in this front, with mullioned windows guarded with iron: Between the walls and the brink of the precipice, is ju&s;t &s;pace enough for a terrace, which in early times was guarded with a curtain wall: The dell is very deep, the banks are &s;teep, and now filled with large fore&s;t trees: The uniformity of the ea&s;t front, the arrangement of the arms, and the whole appearance of the ma&s;onry, te&s;tify that this was part of the original &s;tructure, and a chief entrance; for &s;hould we form our conjecture from the appearance of the center area, we &s;hould conclude every front of the ca&s;tle was &s;imilar to this.</P>
<P>Many accounts and prints have been publi&s;hed of this beautiful place, which &s;trikes the eye of the traveller on the great northern road; the mo&s;t excellent of the prints was by Hearne and Byrne: We will in the fir&s;t place &s;elect from the various publications &s;uch matter as appears mo&s;t worthy attention, and then pro|ceed with our view.

<Q>a great number of &s;pacious apartments, &s;ome antique and others modern: The paintings are valuable, many of them repre&s;enting the ance&s;tors of that noble family, for &s;ome centuries pa&s;t, in the habits of the time. The park, be&s;ides the plea&s;antne&s;s of the &s;ituation, has another and &s;till more valuable circum|&s;tance to recommend it, that of being full of veins of coal; this, together with a navigable river, by which the coals are carried down to Sunderland, render Lumley park an inexhau&s;table mine of trea&s;ure to the family.</Q> In one of the monthly magazines we are informed by a paper &s;igned Edward Barras, <Q>that the park is walled round with hewn &s;tone, had formerly deer, but after it was re|duced and the pales removed, they &s;ickened and died." And he adds, "there are &s;everal dates upon different parts of the ca&s;tle; one was pointed out to me, on the inner &s;ide of one of the ea&s;tern turrets, where the letters I. L. 1550 appear, though almo&s;t defaced.</Q> Much repair has been given to the inner walls of the area; and on one of the ea&s;tern towers are two long &s;trings of e&s;|cutcheons cut in &s;tone, and placed in the building, nine in each row, with the arms of Lumley in the center at the bottom, and in two &s;mall &s;hields at the top, a fleur|de-lis on the dexter &s;ide, and a ro&s;e on the &s;ini&s;ter: In tho&s;e &s;trings the Lumley arms are impaled, with the &s;everal families wherewith they intermarried.</P>
<P>There is a tradition at Che&s;ter, that about a century ago, the remains of an old chapel &s;tood about three hundred yards to the north-we&s;t of the ca&s;tle, with &s;everal vaults and &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages: A hill called Chapel hill, is well known, but no one about the ca&s;tle could give any information touching the buildings.</P>

This John was the &s;on and heir of George Lumley, who &s;uffered death as before mentioned, and grand&s;on and heir of John lord Lumley. In the &s;ixth year of king Edward VI. he was re&s;tored in blood, and that he and the heirs male of his body &s;hould hold and bear the name, dignity, &s;tate, and pre-eminence of a baron of this realm, &amp;c.

the earl, as appears by his will. He afterwards came into great confidence with the queen, and was one of the lords commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;it in trial of the unhappy victim of Elizabeth's jealou&s;ies, and with a firmne&s;s &s;ome hi&s;torians have &s;poken of with expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urprize, delivered his opinion <HI>that the &s;entence was ju&s;tly pronounced again&s;t the queen of Scots.</HI> In the forty-fourth year of the queen he was one of the peers who &s;at on the trial of Robert D'Evereux, earl of E&s;&s;ex. On the acce&s;&s;ion of king James he experienced many te&s;timonies of royal confidence: Camden made mo&s;t honourable mention of him: <Q>He was a per&s;on of entire vir|tue, integrity, and innocence; and in his old age a complete pattern of true no|bility. He had &s;o great a veneration for the memory of his ance&s;tors, that he cau&s;ed monuments to be erected for them in the collegiate church of Che&s;ter in the Street, in order as they &s;ucceeded one another, from Liulphus down to his own time, which he had either picked out of the demoli&s;hed mona&s;teries or made new.</Q> By his will he devi&s;ed his e&s;tates, particularly the ca&s;tle and manor of Lumley, to Richard Lumley, elde&s;t &s;on and heir apparent of Roger Lumley, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> &s;on of Anthony, brother to John lord Lumley his grandfather. He married Jane, the elde&s;t of the two daughters of Henry Fitz-Allan, earl of Arundel, and by her had three children, who died in infancy; and to his &s;econd wife married Elizabeth, daughter of John lord Darcy of Chiche, who &s;urvived him, and by whom he had no i&s;&s;ue: He died on the 11th of April, 1609, and was buried in the church at Cheam.

<P>In an old manu&s;cript which I have &s;een of the de&s;cent of Connyers of Sockbourn, there is written as follow: <Q>Sir John Connyers, Knt. &s;lew the mon&s;trous vermine, and poy&s;onous vermine, or wyverne, or a&s;ke or worm, which overthrew and devoured many and &s;undry people in feight, for that the &s;ent of the poy&s;on thereof was &s;o &s;trong, that no per&s;onne might abide it. And by the providence of Almighty God, this John Connyers, Knt. overthrew the &s;aid mon&s;ter, and &s;lew it. But before he made this enterpri&s;e, having but one &s;on, he went to the church at Sockburn in compleat armour, and offered up that, his only &s;on, to the Holy Gho&s;t: the place where this great &s;erpent lay, was called Gray&s;tane.</Q> And as it is written in the &s;ame manu&s;cript, this John lieth buried in Sockbourn, in compleat armour, before the conque&s;t.</P>

<P>the &s;eat of the family of Liddells, now of Sir Henry George Liddell, bart. &s;tands on the &s;ide of a hill, &s;loping gradually towards the ea&s;t; a &s;ituation not cho&s;en for &s;trength. Near to it, by the road &s;ide, is a &s;tone column, but of what event it is a memorial, hi&s;tory or tradition give no account. The antiquity of this ca&s;tle leads to conjectures as to the etymology of the name; in many old records it is called <HI>Ravens-helm</HI> and <HI>Raven&s;waith,</HI> in the old &s;pelling <HI>Raffen&s;weath.</HI> The Dani&s;h &s;tandard was called <HI>Raffen,</HI> and <HI>weath</HI> is a north country word, now u&s;ed in Scotland for <HI>&s;orrow.</HI> "I &s;hould be very <HI>weath</HI> to do &s;uch an act," is a phra&s;e very commonly u&s;ed in this country. The application we would make is, that Raven&s;worth ca&s;tle is of Dani&s;h foundation, and had its name from them as Raffens-Helm, or the &s;trong hold of the Dani&s;h &s;tandard; and that &s;ome de|feat of that people had occa&s;ioned the name of Raffens-weath, or Dani&s;h woe. All etymologies, where there is &s;uch a mixture of languages as in this country, will be &s;ubject to much uncertainty, and we offer this only as a vague conjecture. This ca&s;tle has anciently formed a complete &s;quare, with a tower at each corner, con|nected with a curtain wall: Whether there was any keep or other &s;tructure in the center, it is not po&s;&s;ible to determine; two of the towers form part of the offices to the pre&s;ent man&s;ion, the other two project to the front. The apartments are &s;mall, but neat, without much ornament; the breakfa&s;t room and room above it are modern, and face the &s;outh, with a bow window; the lower one &s;tuccoed; the upper room elegantly fitted up, and hung with tape&s;try of Antwerp; at one end of the room the land&s;cape work is &s;trikingly beautiful, in the &s;tile of Pou&s;in: There is a &s;pacious &s;aloon, &s;tair-ca&s;e, and a good dining-room. The ca&s;tle is &s;hut in to the north and we&s;t by a fine fore&s;t of oaks, the nur&s;ery of a large breed of herons, and &s;ome phea&s;ants: The &s;outh a&s;pect con&s;i&s;ts of rich meadow lands, &s;cattered over with large trees at irregular di&s;tances: To the ea&s;t the vale of Lame&s;ley, beautifully cloathed with wood, is extended to the eye for a mile and a half; immediately oppo&s;ite, at the greate&s;t di&s;tance, Gate&s;head-fell, wild and &s;haken, with a multitude of hovels and cottages.</P>

When the family of Hodg&s;on obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we have no evidence, but after their enjoyment for a con&s;iderable number of years, male i&s;&s;ue failed in Ralph Hodg&s;on, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> the la&s;t proprietor, on who&s;e death the family e&s;tate at Lints Green de&s;cended to his only daughter now living.</P>

<P>We mu&s;t not quit this tract without ob&s;erving, that traces of a Roman way have frequently been di&s;covered on the moor north of Urpeth, in a direction lead|ing from the north to Che&s;ter: Within a mile of Urpeth is a round hill, with a trench, one of tho&s;e temporary fortifications u&s;ed on the incur&s;ion of the Scots, when they came down in &s;mall bands to pillage the country: Such are numerous all over the borders. At Law&s;ome hill is a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, commanding the Chiviots to the north, Cleveland hills &s;outh, Newca&s;tle towards the ea&s;t, with Lumley ca&s;tle, Che&s;ter, and Durham cathedral on the nearer grounds, the towns of Tanfield and Shield-row, with the mountains at the head of Weredale, on the mo&s;t di&s;tant ground, to the we&s;t. The rivulet of Team may truly be called a mechanic &s;tream, as there are not in the north any works to be compared to tho&s;e its waters &s;upply: It carries ten mills or more, for the working of iron by Crowley's people, making oil, fulling, and grinding corn. Although mining and trade ex|erci&s;e the attention of &s;o many inhabitants, yet agriculture and country occupations are not neglected: The farmers have introduced an improved breed of &s;heep, by cro&s;&s;ing with the Lincoln&s;hire &s;ort, and feed mutton to twenty-five pounds a quarter; the fell &s;heep are &s;mall and degenerated by want of change: The fell-bred cattle are about twenty-five &s;tone weight at the &s;laughter; the better breed come to about &s;ixty &s;tone weight: Such are the &s;tocks on the e&s;tates adjoining the moors; in the lower lands by the banks of the river, the breeds of cattle are much &s;uperior. There are iron mines near Tanfield, which appear to have been wrought in very di&s;tant times: The metal lies at a very incon&s;iderable depth from the &s;urface. If the u&s;e of coal be &s;o important as a late pretended di&s;covery &s;eemed to promi&s;e, the&s;e mines from their &s;ituation may hereafter prove of very great importance.</P>

<P>Adjoining to Lanche&s;ter pari&s;h, on the we&s;t, lies the pari&s;h of Muggle&s;wick. The fir&s;t mention made of this place is in the time of bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, who granted it to the convent of Durham, in exchange for Hardwick: And in the middle of the thirteenth century, Hugh, prior of Durham, inclo&s;ed a park here, and built a ca|mera, con&s;i&s;ting of a hall, chapel, and lodgings: The remains of tho&s;e &s;tructures yet appear, part of the park wall and the ea&s;t end of the chapel; the whole camera has had underground apartments for &s;ecuring cattle during the incur&s;ions of the Scots. Bi&s;hop Bainbrigg granted to the convent a confirmatory charter of Muggle&s;wick, and al&s;o of two hundred and &s;ixteen acres of wood and wa&s;te lands in the vill of Hor&s;eleyhope, given to them by bi&s;hop Kirkham, with licence to in|clo&s;e and empark the &s;ame, accompanied with an in&s;peximus of his predece&s;&s;ors &s;everal grants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bainbrigg Rot.

<P>Several Roman antiquities have been found here, which are taken notice of by Dr Hunter in the Philo&s;o|phical Tran&s;actions, N^o 278. One of the&s;e is a tall altar, but no vi&s;ible in&s;cription upon it. Another is &s;aid to be a man in a Roman dre&s;s, upon a grave&s;tone near the church door. The image is very ob&s;cure, nor do I &s;ee how it can now be di&s;cerned, whether male or female, for there is no in&s;cription at all, and the features are quite gone. There have been two dolphins, one on each &s;ide the image, which is &s;omewhat pe|culiar. When I viewed it, the &s;mall figure at the top appeared like a pine-apple, or perhaps a bunch of ears of corn, and that on the &s;ide of the image &s;eemed de&s;igned for a wreath. I doubt not but it has been &s;e|pulchral, and that the image was intended to repre&s;ent the per&s;on decea&s;ed. <Q>When the ancients erected their own tombs in their life time, they often left the in&s;criptions, and &s;ometimes their e&s;&s;igies, to be cut by their relations or friends after their decea&s;e.

<P><HI>Deo Vitiri Maximus votum &s;olvit.</HI></P>
<P>This according to the account in Camden, was al&s;o found in this place. It is a &s;mall altar erected to the local god <HI>Vitires,</HI> to whom we find a good number of altars in&s;cribed. The letter <HI>A</HI> having no tran&s;ver&s;e is included in <HI>M</HI> at the beginning of the third line, and the <HI>M</HI> and <HI>V</HI> are connected as u&s;ual: The letters are meanly cut. On one &s;ide of the altar is a boar, and a toad on the other. It may de&s;erve to be con&s;idered, why the&s;e noxious creatures &s;hould be repre&s;ented on altars: Whether it might be, that they who erected the altars were much mole&s;ted with them, and addre&s;t to the deities to be delivered from them. <Q>Tis well known that the ancients u&s;ed to addre&s;s to different deities for different benefits, and a&s;cribe names to them &s;uited to the favours which they imagined they received from them. Thus Apollo is &s;aid to have been called <GAP DESC="foreign"> by the Greeks for de&s;troying mice, <GAP DESC="foreign"> in their language &s;ignifying a mou&s;e: And as this country might anciently have been infe&s;ted both with boars and toads, the inhabitants might ap|ply to this god <HI>Vitires</HI> on that account. And &s;ince it was cu&s;tomary with the Romans to adopt into their wor&s;hip the deities of tho&s;e nations which they conquered, this <HI>Maximus</HI> might for that rea&s;on erect an altar to the god <HI>Vitires,</HI> and cut the figures of the&s;e two animals upon it.</Q></P>

<P>We are al&s;o told in Camden, that an urn was found here of a very uncommon &s;hape, near a yard high, and not above &s;even inches wide, with a little cup in the heart of it, perhaps for an oblation of tears, or of wine and milk, &s;uch as the Romans u&s;ed at the burying of their dead.</P>
<P>Several &s;tones of the centurial kind have been found here. One was di&s;covered a few days before I came there, and is very clear and di&s;tinct, having been erected by the fifth cohort of &s;ome legion; mo&s;t likely of the <HI>Legio &s;exta victrix.</HI></P>
<P>There is another centurial &s;tone, which I have repre&s;ented at large, in order to &s;hew that the&s;e &s;tones were generally like what ma&s;ons call <HI>through &s;tones,</HI> or however that they were very long, and went a great way in|to the wall, twice or thrice as far as the other facing &s;tones. Sometimes they are as this, in the form of a pa|rallelopepid, and &s;ometimes of a pyramidal. I can make nothing out of the letters which appear on this.</P>

<P>About the year 1690, that great patron of manufactory and trade, Sir Ambro&s;e Crawley, fixed upon this &s;ituation to e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e works which have employed multitudes of people, and cau&s;ed an influx of wealth &s;ince that happy aera, to this country: He fir&s;t &s;at down at Sunderland by the &s;ea, where, in its infancy, the project was nur&s;ed for five or &s;ix years, but the &s;ituation of this place and its en|virons, both in regard to coals and water, induced him to tran&s;plant his Cyclopean colony hither. The town of Winlayton &s;tands on a high ridge of country, inclin|ing on the ea&s;t, north, and &s;outh towards the rivers Tyne and Derwent. Before Sir Ambro&s;e &s;ettled his people here, the place con&s;i&s;ted of a few de&s;erted cottages, and now contains about fifteen hundred inhabitants, chiefly &s;miths. The works carried on in this town are various; making nails is the chief branch, but there is an eye of jealou&s;y on enquiry, and the traveller can reap little information as to the various articles manufactured, or quantity produced. The buildings are regular, and calculated for convenience and not &s;hew: The &s;treets are well paved. A com|modious chapel was built in the year 1705, which will receive three hundred peo|ple at divine &s;ervice, and a &s;tipend provided for a chaplain <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>The chapel is &s;aid to be erected on the &s;cite of an old chapel, dedicated to St Ann, de&s;troyed in the re|bellion of the earl of We&s;tmoreland: Human bones have been repeatedly dug up, when there was occa&s;ion to break the &s;oil to any depth.</P>

<P>An account of the re-building of Winlaton chapel was printed in London in 1711, to which is prefixed a letter of lord Crewe's, dated from Durham ca&s;tle, 23d of September, 1710, &s;etting forth, that Mr Jonathan Story had been very in&s;trumental in that work. The narrative is addre&s;&s;ed to Henry lord Hyde, by Mr Story, and comprehends an oration delivered by him to the people on occa&s;ion of an attempt to found a di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;e at Winlaton, where he repre&s;ents were &s;ettled in the manufactory above two thou&s;and &s;ouls. Mr Story, though not of the church, in his oration fir&s;t expatiated on the excellency of religion in general; &s;econd, the advantage it hath in the minds of men; third, the excellency of the Chri&s;tian religion in particu|lar; and la&s;tly, full thoughts on the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England; and he recapitulates the circum&s;tances attending the year 1641, and the &s;ucceeding times, with much warmth.&mdash;The fir&s;t place for p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which was licenced 1704-5, was the hall belonging to Sir William Blacket, bart.

A &s;ub&s;cription was next &s;et on foot for building the chapel, which was begun the 17th of April, 1705; on the 23d of Augu&s;t following it was fit to receive the congregation; and in January following it was fully fini&s;hed and beautified, regularly pewed, and a large gallery at the we&s;t end, with a turret and clock: Daily &s;ervice is performed therein.</P></NOTE>.

To put tho&s;e laws in execution, a court of arbitrators was con&s;tituted at Winlaton, to be holden every ten weeks, for hearing and de|termining ca&s;es among the workmen, to which all have an appeal. The fees are fixed beyond innovation, at a moderate rate. This in&s;titution has the mo&s;t happy and exten&s;ive u&s;e, it quiets the differences of the people, protects their claims to ju&s;tice in an ea&s;y and expeditious manner, pre&s;erves them from the ex|pences and di&s;tre&s;s of common law, and the noi&s;ome mi&s;eries of a pri&s;on.

<P>The fir&s;t account we have of the manor of Whickham is in the Boldon Book, where the bi&s;hop had xxxv villain tenants, each of whom held an oxgang of land, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen acres, at &s;ixteen pence rent, exclu&s;ive of &s;ervices, which were &s;evere. Every villain wrought for the lord three days each week in the year, be&s;ides the labour of harve&s;t and plowing; they were bound to erect a cottage forty feet long, and fifteen wide, every year, for the maintenance of the town, and carry and fetch from Durham and Bedlington, the bi&s;hop's baggage, &amp;c. when re|quired, with the allowance of the corrody whil&s;t they wrought. They al&s;o paid nine &s;hillings cornage rent, and provided a milch cow for the lord, and for every oxgang of land they found a hen and ten eggs, and &s;erved in the lord's fi&s;hery in Tyne. The headborough man, who is &s;tiled <HI>praepo&s;itus,</HI> now called the greve, had twenty-four acres of land allotted to him in recompen&s;e for the duties of his office. The manor was then under firm with the villain &s;ervice, mills, carts, barrows, fi&s;heries, and twenty chalder of oats of the bi&s;hop's mea&s;ure, rendering twenty-&s;even pounds, and performing certain &s;ervices in carriage, for which there was an al|lowance of two pence for every hor&s;e. The punder had land a&s;&s;igned him, be&s;ides an acknowledgement from every tillage farm by the threave; and he provided the bi&s;hop with forty hens and three hundred eggs.

<P><PB N="451" REF="478">The adjacent country wears an unplea&s;ant a&s;pect to the traveller, cut and har|rowed up with loaded carriages, &s;cattered over with mean cottages, from whence &s;warm forth innumerable inhabitants, maintained by working in the mines; where many a &s;ooty face is &s;een by every hedge-way &s;ide: The workmen earn great wages, which recompen&s;e every other evil.

After pa&s;&s;ing a piece of water, the chief objects open upon you; to the right lies a noble &s;ylvan &s;cene, of great extent, hanging on inclining grounds, from a lofty &s;ummit, to the very &s;kirts of the vale; in the mid&s;t of which, as a terminating object to the grand vi&s;ta, ri&s;es a fine <HI>Ionic</HI> column of &s;tone, highly wrought, not le&s;s, as we compute, than one hundred and forty feet in height, fini&s;hed with an elegant gilt &s;tatue of <HI>Briti&s;h Liberty,</HI> in who&s;e &s;ervice the per&s;on who erected the work was enthu&s;ia&s;tically virtuous: As you turn from this object, you look upon a terrace above a mile in length, terminated by a new chapel, built in a mo&s;t elegant &s;tile, with a rich portico and dome, highly embelli&s;hed. The chief parts of the man&s;ion-hou&s;e are old, of the architecture which prevailed in the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, containing many &s;pacious apartments: The back part of the hou&s;e is placed &s;o near the brink of a very &s;teep de&s;cent, as merely to admit a terrace walk; from whence is a pro&s;pect, though narrow, highly picture&s;que and beautiful; you look down into a deep vale of meadow grounds, wa&s;hed by the river Derwent, &s;hut in on the right by hanging woods, and on the left by cultivated lands ri&s;ing in irregular &s;wells from the banks of the river, and terminated in the center by a lofty cliff much &s;haken and torn: Walks are cut through the groves, and wind along the margin of the river: Although nature has &s;pread various rich gifts over the &s;cene, yet art has be&s;towed a multitude of embelli&s;hments; the buildings before mentioned, the green-hou&s;e, bath, and other edifices, are fini&s;hed in a good ta&s;te, and &s;ome of them in a &s;uperb &s;tile; with regard to the &s;ylvan beauties, they are not to be paralleled in the whole county.</P>

From the&s;e ob&s;cure accounts little to be depended upon can be collected re&s;pecting its ancient hi&s;tory; the following is its pre&s;ent &s;tate: Its remains &s;tand in Gate&s;head, on the ea&s;t or right hand &s;ide of the high &s;treet leading to Newca&s;tle bridge, from which it is di&s;tant about half a mile. The entrance is through a low &s;quare &s;tone gate, decorated with pila&s;ters, and &s;eemingly of modern con&s;truction. The &s;cite of the hou&s;e with its offices and gardens, occupied about two acres and a half of land: Towards the ea&s;t end of it are the ruins of a man&s;ion, which, from the &s;tile of its architecture, &s;eems to have been built &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;tery, perhaps out of its materials. This probably was Mr Riddle's hou&s;e alluded to by Bourne, and the gateway before mentioned was in all likelihood erected at the &s;ame time. Neare&s;t the road &s;tands the chapel, who&s;e we&s;t end is hand&s;omely ornamented with a number of pointed arches and niches, though the in&s;ide &s;eems remarkably plain: It con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;ingle aile, twenty-one paces broad, by twenty-&s;ix long; &s;ome &s;teps at the ea&s;t end leading to the altar are &s;till remaining; near them is a grave &s;tone, on which is cut a cro&s;s &s;imilar to that on the jamb of the church door at Jarrow; it has al&s;o the marks of an inlaid border about it, but the bra&s;s is gone. The arches of the windows (except tho&s;e of the ea&s;t and we&s;t ends, which are entirely pointed) are round within, and pointed on the out&s;ide. A remarkable ornament is mounted on the ea&s;t end, on a &s;lender rod, being a &s;mall circle chequered by &s;everal bars cro&s;&s;ing each other at right angles. In the year 1745 or 46, this chapel, being, as it is &s;aid, made u&s;e of by the Roman Catholics, was out of a mi&s;guided zeal &s;et on fire by &s;ome per&s;ons, who perhaps meant to pa&s;s for good Prote&s;tants, but by this their intolerant fury, &s;hewed them|&s;elves to be actuated by tho&s;e very principles they affected &s;o much to contemn. This mona&s;tery is now the property of Ralph Clavering, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Callaly, and is chiefly u&s;ed for garden ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This account is attended with an elegant view of the chapel.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e and garden ground, &amp;c. were purcha&s;ed about two years ago by Hen. Elli&s;on, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR>&mdash;The mines were re&s;erved upon this &s;ale.</P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>This account gives us ground to &s;uppo&s;e, that on the martyrdom of bi&s;hop Wal|cher, the old mona&s;tery and church were reduced to a&s;hes; but whether they were &s;ituated where Mr Gro&s;e has attempted to place them, the reader will form his own conjectures. In the quotation from the Magna Britannia, it is &s;aid, touching the ho&s;pital of St Edmund, "who was the founder or benefactor is not known." It is probable that the ruined mona&s;tery, which had been a &s;cene of &s;uch violation, &s;acrilege, and murder, would lie under the horror of tho&s;e crimes, de&s;erted and un|re&s;tored for &s;ome time; and it was not till the year 1247 that we hear of the ho&s;|pital ri&s;ing, as Mr Gro&s;e has pre&s;umed, from its a&s;hes.

About the year 1512 bi&s;hop Ruthall repaired the &s;outh part of the bridge. Under the act of di&s;&s;olution of 1553, all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the bi&s;hopric were ve&s;ted in the crown, and by the act of the &s;ucceeding year, when Gate&s;head was annexed to Newca&s;tle, the lands called Salt Meadows, with the whole river of Tyne and the bridge pa&s;&s;ed therewith, and were adjudged to be within the county and &s;hire of the town of Newca&s;tle, and that the inhabitants of Gate&s;head &s;hould be under the rule, government, and correction of the mayor and burge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle. All the&s;e were re&s;tored in 1554, as before mentioned. The bridge, after the conflagration in 1248, was rebuilt on twelve &s;tone arches, three of which, by the con&s;truction of quays, on the Newca&s;tle &s;ide, were thought unnece&s;&s;ary, and converted into cellars: About the middle of the bridge a tower was erected, with machicolations and iron gates; a little to the &s;outhward of which the boundary &s;tone was fixed, to di&s;tingui&s;h the divi&s;ion of the counties; the end from thence to Gate&s;head belonging to the bi&s;hop of Durham. At the &s;outh end was another tower, and from the vacancy in the archings, there wanting an arch near the &s;outhern tower, it has been pre&s;umed there was in that &s;pace a draw-bridge. The bi&s;hops of Durham have for time immemorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all rights and privileges of the bridge, from the boundary &s;tone &s;outhwards, being called a third part, and granted lea&s;es for lives or years, of all hou&s;es and &s;hops erected thereon, and as occa&s;ion required repaired that part of the bridge. In July 1770, bi&s;hop Trevor repaired with &s;tone the &s;pace before noted, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed the draw-bridge was; it was laid with large beams of timber, and cover|ed with thick planks, upon which the pavement was made: This work was begun on Saturday night or Sunday morning, and fini&s;hed on Thur&s;day following, all the materials of &s;tone being previou&s;ly prepared, and a proper number of workmen, with boats and wherries above and below bridge, for conveying pa&s;&s;engers and car|riages over the river during the time of the work. In the night between the 16th and 17th of November, 1771, there was a flood in the river Tyne, greatly exceeding any noted in hi&s;tory or otherwi&s;e known, by the force of which an arch north of the toll-gate was fir&s;t &s;wept away<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A curious view of the ruined bridge was engraved and publi&s;hed by Mr Beilby of Newca&s;tle.</NOTE>, then another on the &s;outh end fell, with eight hou&s;es on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, tho&s;e on the ea&s;t hanging by their timbers. On Mon|day the 18th, about four in the afternoon, another of the &s;outh arches fell, with the hou&s;es thereon, and the remaining parts of the bridge were &s;o much &s;hattered, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to take the &s;uper&s;tructure down. Only &s;even per&s;ons were lo&s;t by the fall of the &s;everal hou&s;es. The river began to ri&s;e at Newca&s;tle about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, and at five in the morning the arches of the bridge were filled, &s;o that a current was forced into the we&s;t end of the &s;treet called the Clo&s;e, which runs parallel with the river; it overflowed the Sandhill-&s;quare, &s;o that boats plied there, and many of the &s;hops had five feet water in them: The water exceed|ed every other flood of which we have any note; by eight perpendicular feet in height; and infinite lo&s;s and damage was &s;u&s;tained on the &s;hores and in the &s;hip|ing and craft. In 1772 an act of parliament was obtained for making a temporary

<P>GATESHEAD CHURCH is a &s;pacious building, capable of receiving a very numerous congregation, and kept in that order due to places of divine wor&s;hip: It is very light, and receives a good circulation of air: The chancel, from the altar rails, is nine paces long and &s;ix wide; the ea&s;t window con&s;i&s;ting of five lights; there are al&s;o three windows to the &s;outh, and two to the north, under pointed arches: The communion table is &s;upported by cherubs, in &s;tone work; near which are three rece&s;&s;es or &s;eats in the wall within the rails, for prie&s;ts officiating in the ancient &s;ervice, and an aperture for a water ba&s;on. This church is built upon a regular plan, in the form of a cro&s;s, with &s;ide ailes, &s;eparated from the center by five point|ed arches, &s;upported on octagonal columns about fifteen feet high, very light and well proportioned, having this &s;ingularity, that they are without capitals, the arches &s;pringing from the &s;hafts, like the ramifications of a tree, which gives them a beautiful appearance; the arches are about &s;ixteen feet in &s;pan: The whole length of the nave is twenty-eight paces, and its width &s;ixteen; the cro&s;s aile is twenty-four paces long. The &s;outh end of the cro&s;s is lighted by one large window of five lights,
<PB N="467" REF="495">
and two to the ea&s;t of three lights each; the ailes have each two &s;quare windows of three lights: The upper arrangements are regular, con&s;i&s;ting of five windows un|der circular arches. The church is regularly &s;talled with oak, ornamented with fleur-de-lis, has a pretty &s;mall organ, and galleries at the we&s;t end: The font is a large black marble laver: The pulpit is placed again&s;t the fir&s;t &s;outh pillar. The adjacent ground is called the Anchorage or Anchoritage, where the &s;chool|hou&s;e &s;tands, with the beadle's hou&s;e and other edifices belonging the church.

<P>We now approach Jarrow, once a place of great con&s;equence, and of di&s;tant antiquity. Little more remained of this once famous town when we vi&s;ited it in 1782, than two or three mean cottages, the di&s;tracted ruins of the old mona&s;tery, the church, a venerable pile, then patched up &s;o as to retain few traces of its ori|ginal figure, and the capacious haven, now called the <HI>Slake,</HI> wa&s;hed full of &s;and, and left dry by the river Tyne at ebb of tide.</P>
<P>The mona&s;teries of Weremouth and Jarrow were the mo&s;t ancient of any within the limits of this county: That of Weremouth, dedicated to St Peter, we are told, was built in the fourth year of king Egfrid, at the in&s;tance of Benedict a monk, who became the &s;uperior or governor of both hou&s;es: The mona&s;tery of Jar|row, dedicated to St Paul, was erected in the fifteenth year of the &s;ame king; the place being then called <HI>Gyrwy</HI> or <HI>Girvy.</HI> Retirement and &s;eclu&s;ion were not the principles which directed the choice of this &s;ituation; for if the original mo|na&s;tery was placed where the pre&s;ent ruins are, the ground is elevated, and forms a curvature towards the great bay called the Slake, which ancient authors tell us was the haven of Egfrid, where, con&s;i&s;tent with the burthen of ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed in that age, a thou&s;and &s;ail might lie moored in the greate&s;t &s;ecurity.

habitation and church: But their peace was not of long continuance; for in the &s;eventh year of O&s;bert's reign, the Danes again entered the Tyne, practi&s;ing their accu&s;tomed rapine and deva&s;tation, and laying wa&s;te all the religious hou&s;es. In the interval, whil&s;t the See or epi&s;copal &s;eat was fixed at Che&s;ter, we may rea&s;on|ably pre&s;ume the mona&s;tery at Jarrow was again re&s;tored; and from the &s;tile and order of architecture, we are led to conjecture, that part of the &s;tructures &s;tanding at the time we vi&s;ited them, were of that age: But the religious body had not yet &s;u&s;tained the la&s;t of their misfortunes, for though &s;ubject to all the mi&s;eries of the provincial war which di&s;tracted this part of the i&s;land, during the &s;truggles between the Saxon and Dani&s;h &s;overeigns, when they were frequently pillaged and laid under contributions. Upon the enraged Normans marching northward, and find|ing the city of Durham de&s;erted, and the country evacuated, they put their &s;acri|legious hands to this mona&s;tery, and notwith&s;tanding they boa&s;ted of the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the go&s;pel, yet, as &s;avage as the unenlightened barbarians of the north, they reduced the &s;acred edifices again to a&s;hes. Having advanced to this period, we &s;hould now pay attention to the venerable character of Bede, and pre&s;ent to the reader &s;ome &s;hort anecdotes of his life.</P>
<P>This holy monk was born about the year 672, in a part of this county adjoining the river Were, where the mona&s;tery of Weremouth afterwards had lands; that hou&s;e not being founded till the year 674, according to his own account thereof: Much controver&s;y has happened relative to the place of his nativity, but it is well &s;ettled by hi&s;torians, that he was born in the di&s;trict before mentioned: At &s;even years of age he was taken into the mona&s;tery at Weremouth, and under the care of abbot Benedict and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Ceolfrid received his education; at the age of nineteen was ordained deacon, and became exemplary at that early &s;tage for his piety and &s;tudious life: The attention paid to him by all ranks of people, &s;o far from moving him with vanity, or tempting him to negligence, &s;eemed only to excite him to a more eager pur&s;uit of learning, and &s;tricter rules of religious conduct, in&s;o|much that his character was held forth as a pattern of Chri&s;tian virtues, and his life as an example of mona&s;tic duty. About the year 685, in the fifteenth of king Egfrid, the mona&s;tery of Jarrow was founded under the conduct and &s;uperintendency of Benedict: Bede attained his thirtieth year before he was ordained prie&s;t, which of|fice was performed by John of Beverley, then bi&s;hop of Hexham, who had been his preceptor, and entertained great affection for him; much of his excellent cha|racter was deduced from maxims in&s;tilled by that great teacher, which he con&s;tant|ly profe&s;&s;ed to follow as the chief principles of his conduct. His great diligence and application, comprehen&s;ive genius, and exten&s;ive learning, rendered his name &s;o famous, that he became the &s;ubject of attention in foreign countries, particularly at Rome, where pope Sergius, &s;truck with the accounts he heard of this illu&s;trious &s;cholar, wrote to his &s;uperior the abbot Ceolfrid to &s;end him thither, that he might conver&s;e with him on &s;ome momentous &s;ubjects. Bede, as &s;ingular in his mode&s;ty as accompli&s;hments, received the &s;ummons without any of that emotion this flatter|ing di&s;tinction would have rou&s;ed in many other minds; but attentive alone to his &s;tudies, and the due performance of religious duties, he was not to be allured from
<PB N="473" REF="501">
his cell by the &s;miles of potentates, and the courte&s;y of princes. It has been re|marked by many authors, that in pur&s;uance of Ceolfrid's command, he was or|dained prie&s;t preparatory to his journey to Rome; but why he did not obey the call, has not been accounted for by tho&s;e writers, further than that it is ob&s;erved the pope died in 701, which event might not be known in England at the time of our monk's receiving ordination. No notice is taken of the foregoing circum|&s;tances by Bede in any of his writings, and the whole re&s;ts chiefly on the account given by William of Malm&s;bury and his copyi&s;ts. It is certain he &s;hewed at all times a particular de&s;ire for privacy and retirement, an avidity for learning, and an ince&s;&s;ant application to &s;tudy, together with a warm affection for his native country; &s;uch might operate powerfully with his own mind again&s;t the journey, whil&s;t the con&s;equence he was of to the northern clergy, might influence the great people to &s;ue for his relea&s;e from an engagement &s;o di&s;agreeable to his own wi&s;hes; and contrary to the intere&s;ts of his country. By remaining in his mona&s;tery, and habituating him&s;elf to a reclu&s;e life, he had &s;ufficient time to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of every branch of literature which at that period had gained a footing in this i&s;land; and his acqui&s;itions were made without any apparent de&s;ire of &s;ame or promotion, but merely to render him&s;elf u&s;eful to &s;ociety, and for the promotion of religion and virtue. It was from &s;uch principles that he applied him&s;elf for &s;everal years in collecting materials for his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, which received in the early ages of the Engli&s;h church infinite applau&s;e, and at this time is e&s;teemed an ine&s;timable record; in the compo&s;ition of which great work the &s;everal legendary and miraculous relations are con&s;idered as merely the errors of the age, and not blots of the excellent pen which related them. Though Bede was bred at Weremouth, yet it is admitted by all writers he took up his re&s;idence at Jarrow, &s;oon after that mona&s;tery was founded, and the &s;ame &s;uperior govern|ing both hou&s;es, much intercour&s;e was had between the religious &s;ocieties; &s;o that we &s;ee him at periods &s;poken of by &s;ome writers as a monk of Weremouth, and by others of Jarrow, which variance is ea&s;ily reconciled when we con&s;ider the before-related fact. Bede publi&s;hed his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory in 731, when, ac|cording to his own account, he was fifty-nine years of age; but before this he had written many other books, on a variety of &s;ubjects, a catalogue of which he &s;ub|joined to that great work. There was a &s;trict friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Egbert bi&s;hop of York and Bede, which produced a letter from our monk, de&s;criptive of the tempers and characters of both, and giving a picture of the manners of the age, and the &s;tate of the church, &s;uch as no other authority &s;upplies; full of &s;ervour, religious cen&s;ure, virtuous zeal, and bold condemnation. The letter di&s;covers the collective mind of the author, whil&s;t his prophetic rea&s;onings and the di&s;tant con|&s;equences he deduced and predicted from the inordinances de&s;cribed, &s;hew the &s;hrewdne&s;s of his judgment, and the capaciou&s;ne&s;s of his ob&s;ervation: He fore&s;aw the multiplying of religious foundations, and the want of di&s;cipline which daily broke in upon the conventual rules, would bring on the de&s;truction which in after ages took place. When he wrote this epi&s;tle he was in a bad &s;tate of health, his death from that time advancing by a gradual decay; yet in all the progre&s;&s;ive

&s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e he did not neglect his duty, he employed the u&s;ual hours in writing, in &s;tudy, in devotion, in exhortation of the brethren, and teaching his di&s;|ciples of the convent. He endured the attacks of death with great fortitude, ex|emplary piety, and holy re&s;ignation, and expired on the 26th of May, being the fea&s;t of the A&s;cen&s;ion, in the year 735 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epilogum de obitu Bedae, ex &s;ine libri 1^i Gulielm. a Maildulphi curia de reg.&mdash;Script.

<P>Soon after bi&s;hop Walcher was &s;ettled in the See, he invited certain Bene|dictines to take up their abode at Jarrow; they found the mona&s;tic buildings in ruin, though it appears &s;ome walls were yet &s;tanding, over which they formed a roof of wood, and thatched it with &s;traw, where they renewed divine offices. The &s;ociety increa&s;ing rapidly, the bi&s;hop granted various lands for their &s;upport, and they began to rebuild their church. The reader will revert to the account given of this &s;ociety under the annals of bi&s;hop Walcher. Bi&s;hop William de Carilepho confirmed to the monks of Jarrow the endowment made by his predece&s;&s;or; and &s;oon after removing the &s;eculars from the cathedral church, he tran&s;lated the monks of this hou&s;e to Durham, and from thenceforth Jarrow became only a cell to the mona&s;tery of Durham. When Galfrid de Burdon was elected prior of Durham, on his predece&s;&s;or's re&s;ignation, he had this cell with the manor of Wardle a&s;&s;igned for his maintenance.

The entrance into the church was by a low porch with a circular arch, on the north jamb of which was the figure of a cro&s;ier &s;taff, &s;tripped from &s;ome of the ancient tombs: The de&s;cent into the nave was by three deep &s;teps, on the &s;ide walls of which were two pointed arches, that to the north built up, the other opening into a porch u&s;ed as a ve&s;try room; the groins were &s;prung from brackets, and the &s;pan was about twenty feet: The nave was twenty-eight paces in length, and only &s;ix in width; &s;o that, from the height of the &s;ide walls, which were nearly thirty feet, and the &s;mall irregular windows &s;catter|ed on each &s;ide, the edifice had a very &s;ingular appearance: Some of the win|dows were under circular arches, others pointed, and all the walling &s;o patched and irregular, that it was not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed to what age any particular part of it belonged: The congregation had de&s;erted the nave for &s;ome years, perhaps from dread of being buried in its ruins, and the chancel alone was u&s;ed for divine &s;ervice.

The argument before the barons of the exchequer in the ca&s;e of Jarrow Slake, upon &s;hew|ing cau&s;e again&s;t the decree of that court, and al&s;o again&s;t a perpetual injunction to be made for the town of Newca&s;tle again&s;t the dean and chapter afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The dean and chapter's council were Mr Sol. General, Mr Serj. Wright, Sir W. Williams Sir T. Powis, Mr Dormer, Mr Brown, Mr Turner, Mr Phipps, and Mr Bowes, to &s;hew cau&s;e again&s;t the decree made the la&s;t term, for quieting the plaintiffs in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their franchi&s;es, &amp;c. according to the prayer of their bill, and that the defendants may be &s;topt from erecting any &s;hore or wharf at Jarrow Slake. They thereupon in&s;i&s;ted on the&s;e three points: 1&s;t, That the court ought to make no decree upon this bill, 2d, That they ought not to grant a perpetual injunction. 3d, That before they make their decree ab&s;olute with a perpetual injunction, they ought to grant a new trial, or a rea&s;onable time to make out a right at law.</P>
<P>The rehear&s;al of the&s;e arguments is voluminous, I &s;hall only &s;elect the heads of each &s;ubject. Newca&s;tle pre&s;cribes that no balla&s;t wharf was ever erected at Jarrow: A negative pre&s;cription. The thing complained of, is the erection of a public nui&s;ance upon a public navigable river, for which they alledge no &s;pecial right in them&s;elves but as con&s;ervators: Should have pro&s;ecuted in the king's name. They make no title to the &s;oil. The decree is to quiet them in all the liberties pre&s;cribed to in the bill, the i&s;&s;ues related to Jarrow Slake only: The decree would bind the dean and chapter's right in all other parts of the river, and to quiet the plaintiffs in their pretended privileges from Sparhawk to Heddon Streams, fifteen miles. The only ground of their right is the pretended con&s;ervator&s;hip; which mu&s;t be derived from the crown, and that by record, which they &s;hew not. Second general head: The doctrine of perpetual injunctions. They are new, and nothing found of them in our old books. Originated on trials of ejectment, and devi&s;ed to prevent multiplicity of &s;uits for the &s;ame thing. Judge Hale, the oracle of the law, would never confine a man's right to one trial. It was a new notion for courts of equity to lay &s;uch fetters upon the common law. Third general head&punc; Several ca&s;es were cited where new trials were granted, and affidavits of &s;everal records being di&s;covered &s;ince the trial. Coun&s;el then &s;tated, 1&s;t, That <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> it&s;elf was a corporation within the time of memory, and &s;o incapable of pre&s;cribing time beyond memory. That its ancient name was <HI>Monkche&s;ter,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> from the ca&s;tle built there by William Rufus; was afterwards forfeited by Rob. de Mowbray earl of Northumberland, and remained in the crown till king John granted it, which is time within memory, the time of memory being to be computed from the beginning of the reign of king Richard I. 2d, That commi&s;&s;ions of con&s;ervator&s;hip have been frequently granted from the crown to the mayor, &amp;c. whereby it appears they acted from time to time under the crown, and &s;o were not con&s;ervators by pre&s;cription. 3d, That the church of Durham has time beyond memory con&s;tantly enjoyed the &s;outh &s;ide of the river Tyne <HI>u&s;q. ad filum aquae,</HI> or at lea&s;t a third part of it, and enjoyed the con&s;ervator&s;hip on their own &s;ide&punc; 4th, That balla&s;t wharfs have not been u&s;ed upon this river for above one hundred years, and &s;o cannot be pre&s;cribed to time beyond memory. 5th, That the corporation has claimed them as proprietors of the &s;oil, and not as con&s;ervators, &amp;c. Several records were produced and read: 1. A commi&s;&s;ion of con|&s;ervator&s;hip 45th k. Edw. III. to the mayor and others. 2. Another commi&s;&s;ion 32d k. Henry VI. directed to the mayor and others for con&s;ervator&s;hip of the river inter Sparhawk &amp; Heddon Streams: The very bounds pre&s;cribed to in their bill. 3. K.

By this record the corporation pleads inter alia, that king John and his predece&s;&s;ors, kings of England, were time beyond memory &s;ei&s;ed of the town of Newca&s;tle, and the whole river of Tine, and the whole bridge, and being &s;o &s;ei&s;ed granted it to them, whereby it appears they derived their original right from king John, which is time
<PB N="479" REF="507">within memory. The dean and chapter's council urged this record as an e&s;topple again&s;t their pre&s;cribing in them&s;elves. 9. Act of parl. 1^o Mariae, for reuniting the town of Gate&s;head with the water and bridge to the county palatines juri&s;diction, and for repealing the act made 7th king Edw. IV.

A record annexed to the <HI>record, marchiar</HI> giving an account hi&s;torically how the town of Newca&s;tle and county of Northumberland came to the Mowbrays, and were forfeited by them; of its name of Monkche&s;ter and when it took the name of Newca&s;tle. &amp;c. 3. An in&s;peximus of king John's charter of incorporation to Newca&s;tle, and all their other charters till the time of king Henry VI. whereby it appears they never had the port granted to them as appur|tenant to it, nor the con&s;ervator&s;hip of it. Whereupon the defendant's coun&s;el prayed a new trial. The arguments were long, and would afford little plea&s;ure to the reader, I &s;hall therefore only &s;elect &s;uch &s;pecial matters from thence as may &s;eem important. As to the i&s;&s;ues being particular to Jarrow Slake, and the decree general to the whole river, the plaintiff's coun&s;el gave no an&s;wer. But the lord chief baron wondered how it had crept into the decree, and agreed that the decree could only be particular as to Jarrow Slake. They gave no an&s;wer to the objection that the plaintiffs ought to derive their con&s;ervator&s;hip from the crown. The chief baron cited many in&s;tances of pepetual injunctions; but it was agreed they have been only in u&s;e &s;ince the reign of king Charles I. As to the records, the plaintiff's coun&s;el alledged, that it did not appear any thing was done under the commi&s;&s;ions of con&s;ervator&s;hip, or that the mayor of Newca&s;tle ever accepted them; to which it was an&s;wered, the acceptance mu&s;t be pre&s;umed, if nothing is &s;hewn to the contrary. As to the 2d article, the record of king Henry I. being of date beyond memory, ought not to be given in evi|dence, without &s;hewing an allowance of it in eyre: Ca&s;es cited to the contrary in an&s;wer. 3d article: Op|po&s;ed the reading of it, affirming it to be only an action of tre&s;pa&s;s pro&s;ecuted by the bi&s;hop, for tre&s;pa&s;s done in taking away &s;hips, &amp;c. and being betwixt other parties ought not to be read. This the chief baron over|ruled, but ob&s;erved it was a &s;trange &s;ort of commi&s;&s;ion, being a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer, to hear and determine one particular tre&s;pa&s;s, which he thought the king him&s;elf had not a power to grant.&mdash; Mr Dormer an&s;wered, that there were &s;pecial cu&s;toms in the county palatine different from the common and ordinary cu&s;toms of the realm, and his lord&s;hip's commi&s;&s;ion when he &s;at there as judge was <HI>ad audiendum &amp; terminand. &s;ecundum legem terrae &amp; con&s;uetud. Dunelm.</HI> 4th article: Mr Mul&s;o objected, that upon attempts by the bi&s;hop, the corporation brought a <HI>&s;cire facias</HI> to repeal the la&s;t grant, a copy whereof was &s;aid to be produced at the hearing; and &s;ince the corporation have had the enjoyment. Art. 5. The lord chief baron produced his notes, which he had taken upon hearing the cau&s;e of king John's charter, whence he ob&s;erved that king John granted <HI>probis hominibus eju&s;dem, inter alia. omnes ea&s;dem libertates &amp; liberas con&s;uetudines quas habere con&s;ueverunt tempore Hen.</HI> 2. <HI>patris no&s;tri:</HI> And &s;aid, he looked upon that charter of king John's to be only a charter of confirmation. Serj. Lutwich likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted that this proves their incorporation time beyond memory. The objections to the &s;tat. 1 Mar. over-ruled. The lord chief baron then read notes of a trial in which he was concerned as coun&s;el in <HI>Riley's Placita Parl. fo.</HI> 25, the corporation of Newca&s;tle again&s;t the prior of Tynmouth.

Upon this Mr Leonard Carr and Mr Cuth. Bewick complained, and the town cau&s;ed them to lay them upon the land, of which they have made mighty heaps. When king James I. came to the crown he was plea&s;ed to be bountiful to his country|men; among the re&s;t Sir Henry Gibb being one of his officers, he be&s;towed upon him the lord&s;hip of Jar|row, and he would have procured a &s;hore there to ca&s;t balla&s;t; but although he had the favour of the king, yet the town u&s;ed &s;uch means and gave &s;uch rea&s;ons to his maje&s;ty and the council, that they found it de|trimental to the town, and e&s;pecially to the river, &s;o that he was utterly hindred and di&s;appointed.</Q></P>

Some of the religious had figured the pla&s;tering of the north wall, to make the &s;un-beams from one of the windows &s;erve as a dial to point out the hour of the day. You advance to the chancel under the archings of the tower; the pillars very low, ill proportioned, and &s;quare, with capitals remarkably heavy and plain; the arches circular, and without ornament; the dome vaulted with &s;tone and rib'd, the groins ri&s;ing from the corners, and the ribs uniting in the center: The circum&s;tance of the pillars not &s;tanding &s;quare, but forming an oblong north and &s;outh, was remarkable; the width of this part was only five paces. The tower &s;tanding in the center induces us to conclude that formerly this church was in the form of a cro&s;s, and it is probable, from outward appearances, that the nave had &s;ide ailes. We do not know one in&s;tance where the tower &s;tands between the chancel and nave that there is not or anciently was a cro&s;s aile, and few have the

The length of the chancel from the tower to the altar rails is ten paces, and the width only about five paces, &s;talled on each &s;ide with old carved oak work: The ea&s;t win|dow con&s;i&s;ted of three lights under a pointed arch. On the north &s;ide there were two windows, one under a circular arch, and the other a pointed arch, one win|dow to the &s;outh clo&s;e by the tower, having al&s;o a pointed arch; all which cir|cum&s;tances &s;hew the edifice had undergone innumerable alterations, and indeed we con&s;idered no part &s;o ancient as the tower, which it is pre&s;umed was the chief of what remained after the deva&s;tation committed by the Normans. We found no remarkable &s;culptures here &s;ave a &s;epulchral one, which had the figure of a burning taper, with expanded wings. What, was &s;hewn as the greate&s;t curio&s;ity, and is carefully kept in the ve&s;try-room, is a great two-armed chair, &s;aid to have been the common &s;eat of Bede, and which has remained there &s;ince his time: It is of oak, and appears as rude as if hewn out with an ax, except that at the top of the back the cro&s;s piece is morti&s;ed to the &s;tandards or upright parts, which al&s;o &s;erve for legs; the&s;e with the &s;eat and &s;ides are very ancient, but the back, according to the information of the per&s;on who &s;hewed it, is modern: It is now become very rough and uneven from the &s;uper&s;tition of people, who, by carrying away a chip from it, pre&s;ume they have obtained the &s;aint's protection*.</P>

<P>De&s;cending into this vale, we found the country in a very different mode of agri|culture from that we had pa&s;&s;ed: Navigation, trade, and the mines fully occupy the hands of the indu&s;trious in the neighbourhood of Gate&s;head and Whickham. In the valley about Hebborn the lands are laid out in beautiful order, well culti|vated and planted; new roads are formed, the buildings are improved, and a hap|py fertility rewards the attention of the owner. Several beautiful man&s;ions, with plantations and plea&s;ure-grounds, ornament the &s;cene; and the greate&s;t part of the country from Gate&s;head to Shields is remarkably plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The towns of NORTH and SOUTH SHIELDS lie oppo&s;ite to each other. Bourne remarks that North-Shields, in the reign of king Edward I. when the conte&s;t be|tween Newca&s;tle and the priory of Tinmouth happened, had only five or &s;ix fi&s;her|men's huts, and was become a large place but of late years, the church having been erected in 1659. South-Shields is al&s;o much improved of late years; it is &s;ituated on a higher &s;hore, whence it is le&s;s affected by the &s;moke of the &s;everal works carried on there, and &s;tands more commodious for keys, &s;hip-builders yards, and many other matters material to trade. On a fine plain a large &s;quare is lately built, having the church on the &s;outh, with &s;treets branching from the centers of each &s;ide of the &s;quare, and a hand&s;ome town-hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is al&s;o u&s;ed by the dean and chapter as a court-hou&s;e: Notice was given to hold a court leet there on Tue&s;day the 16th of October, 1770, for the whole manor of We&s;toe.</P>

Bi&s;hop Trevor granted them a market, to be held weekly on Wedne&s;day, from the 17th of October, 1770, and two yearly fairs on the 24th of June and the 1&s;t of September. Much trade is carried on here; fre|quently four hundred &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els lie in this haven at a time; &s;hips of &s;uch burthen as cannot come up to the Newca&s;tle quays load and unload here: Some branches of trade have decrea&s;ed of late years, particularly that of &s;alt-boiling, which u&s;ed to produce a duty of 80,000l. a year, and for &s;ome years pa&s;t has not exceeded 10,000l. About fifty years ago it is &s;aid there were two hundred &s;alt pans wrought here, now there are not more than thirty. But whil&s;t that trade has declined, others of great con&s;equence have improved as rapidly; for within the di&s;tance of
<PB N="483" REF="511">
forty years there were not more than four &s;hips which belonged to this town, and now we are informed there are about five hundred, of between one hundred and five hundred tons burthen: Eleven &s;hips were built and launched from the yards in 1781. There are here three dry docks for repairing, and ten yards for building &s;hips: Four gla&s;s-hou&s;es for making crown gla&s;s and bottles; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed the number of &s;ettled inhabitants is about fifteen thou&s;and. Mr Fordyce erected a large barilla work here, but it did not an&s;wer his expectations; &s;ome or mo&s;t of the buildings are now u&s;ed for a &s;oap-boilery. The victualling and fitting out &s;uch a number of &s;hips by the &s;i&s;ter towns, as re&s;ort to this haven, of which South-Shields has a con&s;iderable proportion, the many branches of trade and manufacture carried on there, produce a va&s;t influx of wealth. The importance of South-Shields has aro&s;e in little more than a century: The church, a chapel of ea&s;e under Jarrow, had occa&s;ion to enlarge the burial yard; and, in 1631, bi&s;hop How&s;on con&s;ecrated a plot of ground for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In MS.

<P>The antiquity of the church at Shields is not to be deduced with accuracy from any records before us; it was perhaps nearly cotemporary with that of Jarrow: Little can be gathered from the &s;tructure, it has been &s;o often altered and reform|ed. The nave is twenty-eight paces in length, having to the &s;outh an aile, formed by five &s;hort round pillars with plain capitals, &s;upporting pointed arches, apparent|ly of a more modern date than the columns; the four arches ea&s;tward are uni|form, but the two to the we&s;t much loftier, and of a different model: The width of the nave and &s;outh aile is eleven paces: The aile on the north &s;ide is new, erect|ed in 1753, and &s;ix paces wide; the pillars are &s;quare, and arches circular, neatly &s;tuccoed: It is galleried above the whole length, and regularly &s;talled below: There is al&s;o a gallery at the we&s;t end, and three &s;mall ones in the &s;outh aile: The church is pla&s;tered throughout, and ceiled with plain &s;tucco-work: The place or rece&s;s for the communion-table is in the modern fa&s;hion, without any chancel, &s;ix paces wide, and lighted with a large Venetian window.

a fine point of land, are particularly beautiful: But that from the ropery-walk ex|cels every thing of the kind in the north of England. The river thronged with ve&s;&s;els, and animated with an ince&s;&s;ant pa&s;&s;age of &s;mall craft, is clo&s;e on your left hand: The batteries and barracks on the northern &s;hore di&s;play a &s;triking military &s;cene, whil&s;t on the more di&s;tant ground, from the brow of lofty rocks, ri&s;e the venerable remains of Tinmouth priory: At the time we &s;aw this pro&s;pect, the cliffs were gilded with the evening &s;un; the da&s;hing billows which broke over the bar of the river drove their foam again&s;t the precipices, over which the &s;olemn abbey, in the weeds of ruin, with di&s;tracted a&s;pect, &s;inking under the de&s;troying hand of Time, compleated &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of picture&s;que objects as &s;eldom are found in a &s;pace &s;o confined.</P>
<P>Bourne, &s;peaking of the river Tyne, &s;ays, <Q>The mouth of the river forms a haven &s;o deep as to carry ve&s;&s;els of a con&s;iderable burthen, and of that &s;ecurity that they are not in danger either of &s;torms or &s;hallows, &s;ave that within le&s;s than half a mile of the bar of Tinmouth (which is a &s;and that lies cro&s;s the river's mouth, not above &s;even feet deep at low water) you meet with many rocks, which are called by the &s;ailors the Black Middens, which are very dan|gerous; but to prevent any mi&s;chiefs which might happen in the night time, there are two light-hou&s;es, maintained by the Trinity-hou&s;e in Newca&s;tle; and near them, in the year 1672, was built a fort called Clifford's fort, which effec|tually commands all the ve&s;&s;els that enter the river.</Q></P>
<P>Many judicious antiquaries have been of opinion, that there was a Roman &s;tation at the point of land near South-Shields; and indeed the importance of this river was &s;uch, that we can &s;carcely imagine &s;o cautious and intelligent a people would have neglected the &s;outhern &s;hore, where an enemy's troops at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons might &s;afely be di&s;embarked if the coa&s;t was unguarded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Hor&s;ley's Brit. Rom. p. 286. There has been a Roman &s;tation here, and to this belong the three fol|lowing antiquities.</P>
<P>An altar was (when I took the draught of it) upon the &s;pot where the &s;tation has been, lying at the north|we&s;t corner. Dr Hunter has &s;ince got it removed to the library of Durham, where I &s;aw it, when la&s;t there.</P>
<P>It is of a coar&s;e brown &s;tone, much of the &s;ame nature with what we frequently meet with in other Roman altars; though the people here tell me, no &s;uch &s;tone is now to be found in the&s;e parts The u&s;ual &s;acrifi|cing ve&s;&s;els are upon the &s;ides of the altars, and the knife upon the back, which is not &s;o common.&mdash; There has no doubt been an in&s;cription upon this altar, though it is now entirely effaced. Yet as this was the only original I could recover belonging to this &s;tation, I thought proper to give a draught of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, two other altars have been found at this place; one of which, as I am informed, was built up in a quay wall about forty years ago, and is not now to be come at. The other was fir&s;t &s;ent to York to Dr Li&s;ter, and &s;ince his death, as I have been told, was &s;ent to Norwich to one Mr Giles, and I &s;uppo&s;e is now lo&s;t. Dr Li&s;ter publi&s;hed it in the Tran&s;actions, N^o 145, and from thence it has been in&s;erted in Camden's Brit. and in Dr Gale's edition of Antonine's Itinerary, p. 9.</P>

<P>I have taken the draught of the altar and in&s;cription from the copy of Dr Li&s;ter, compared with the others, and given a reading of the in&s;cription &s;omewhat different from Dr Li&s;ter's, and only pricked tho&s;e letters or parts of letters which I imagine ought to be &s;upplied. As it is not u&s;ual to place the word <HI>Imperator</HI> after the name of the emperor, &s;o I &s;ee no occa&s;ion for doing it here. The Doctor ob&s;erves, that this altar might be erected for Caracalla when going into Caledonia. Severus is, I believe, generally joined to Caracalla in the in&s;criptions before the Caledonian expedition, as he was in the expedition it&s;elf. This makes it le&s;s pro|bable that Caracalla is intended in the in&s;cription, and yet <HI>ob reditum,</HI> and the titles <HI>pii felicis</HI> don't &s;eem to &s;uit Marcus Aurelius, nor <HI>ob reditum</HI> Commodus, though to him <HI>pius felix</HI> are u&s;ually annexed. So that I &s;uppo&s;e it yet more improbable, that either of the&s;e are intended. Nor do I think there is much in having both <HI>pro &s;alute,</HI> and <HI>ob reditum</HI> in the in&s;cription. It is for his &s;afe return: <HI>Pro &s;alute itus et reditus</HI> is not un|common.</P>

<P>Dr Li&s;ter, who fir&s;t wrote out this in&s;cription, and from who&s;e copy the others have &s;ince been taken, tells us, that it contained nine lines, and therefore has left a &s;pace between the fifth and &s;ixth line &s;ufficient to con|tain two others.

Two elevated pavements in the river Tyne, the one at the we&s;t end of South-Shields, the other on the north &s;ide of the river, near the end of the Roman wall, proper for their &s;afe landing at different times of the ebbing and flowing tide, fully &s;hew its nece&s;&s;ary corre&s;pondence with <HI>Segedunum,</HI> the fir&s;t &s;tation upon the wall. But another military way called <HI>Wreken Dyke</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>That there has been a Roman &s;tation at South-Shields is out of all que&s;tion; the altars that have been found there, and the military way which has gone from it, are convincing proofs of this. I once imagined
<PB N="487" REF="515">this &s;tation might have been the old <HI>Glanoventa</HI> (which no doubt was the mo&s;t ea&s;terly on this rout at that time) mentioned in the Itinerary and in the Notitia, and that this iter had begun here, and proceeded accord|ing to the military way leading from hence to Lanche&s;ter: But the di&s;tances in the Itinerary are not to be re|conciled to the di&s;tances between the re&s;pective &s;tations on this way, if we begin at South-Shields. Be&s;ides, that the &s;lender remains of the &s;tation and military way near it, incline me to think it has not been mention|ed &s;o late as till the writing of the Notitia, that it was in being at the time of Marcus Aurelius, appears from the altar and in&s;cription found here, if Dr Li&s;ter's reading be ju&s;t; but I am apt to think it was abandoned not very long after, perhaps at the building of Severus's wall, and the &s;tation erected at Cou&s;in's hou&s;e, or a little after. This &s;tation &s;eems not to be named either in Ptolemy, the Itinerary, or Notitia, unle&s;s we &s;up|po&s;e <HI>O&s;tia Vedrae</HI> in Ptolemy to be as well the name of the &s;tation as of the river mouth.</P>
<P>I know no other name for the Roman &s;tation and town at the mouth of the river, (<HI>Vedra</HI> Tine) near South-Shields, but <HI>O&s;tia Vedrae.</HI> If we con&s;ider the &s;tation it&s;elf, the altar in&s;cribed to one of the Antonines, and the nearne&s;s of the place to the Roman wall, one can &s;carce &s;uppo&s;e, that the river and &s;tation &s;hould be wholly unknown to Ptolemy; and yet unle&s;s the&s;e be their names, they are namele&s;s in this geographer. I own the force of this argument is abated, when we con&s;ider, that neither Newca&s;tle nor any other of the Ro|man places on the wall are mentioned by this ancient author; but it is true, that towns rather than &s;orts came under Ptolemy's notice.</P>
<P>In this place it will not be ami&s;s to take notice of Wreken Dyke, the military way &s;o called. This military way has no doubt terminated at South-Shields. It &s;eems to have come from the &s;tation, and to have cro&s;&s;ed the mar&s;h, then po&s;&s;ibly a branch of the river, not far from the &s;tation. Thence it has pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t probably through, or a little to the ea&s;t of a hou&s;e called Lay-gate; from thence it &s;eems to have gone near a hou&s;e called the Barns, the garden wall probably &s;tanding on it, and &s;o on to the Dean bridge, clo&s;e by Jar|row Slake. For this &s;pace, the traces of this way are very ob&s;cure and uncertain: In the field beyond this bridge the track of it is plain, and for near the full breadth of the inclo&s;ure, &s;en&s;ibly rai&s;ed above the level of the re&s;t of the ground, though it runs cro&s;s the ridges. On the we&s;t &s;ide of this field or inclo&s;ure there is a &s;mall de&s;cent, and in the bottom a lane, which is the high road from Bowden to Shields, and a &s;mall a&s;cent on the other &s;ide in the field joining this lane. As the military way a&s;cends on the one &s;ide and de&s;cends on the other, it is bent into a curve, and then falls into the right line, in which it &s;eems to be continued all the way to Gate&s;head fell for the &s;pace of five or &s;ix miles; from thence it goes towards Lame&s;ley and Kibble&s;|worth, which it leaves a little to the &s;outh. It was very vi&s;ible all the way not many years ago, before Sir Henry Liddell inclo&s;ed and improved tho&s;e grounds. And the gardener at Cou&s;in's hou&s;e, who formerly wrought on Gate&s;head fell, a&s;&s;ured me he had &s;een and helped to dig up &s;ome &s;tones out of Wreken Dyke, which he called Bracken Dyke, &s;o that he was altogether of opinion that this part of it had been paved. This way pa&s;&s;es on towards Beami&s;h, and I make no doubt has gone forward to Lanche&s;ter. It is indeed lo&s;t on the moor beyond Beami&s;h, nor is it any great wonder it &s;hould be &s;o, con&s;idering how mo&s;&s;y and lo&s;t it is. I was a&s;&s;ured at Lanche&s;ter that &s;everal trees had been dug up in this moor, which had been cut down with an ax, probably to clear this way; and if the&s;e trees have been &s;unk &s;o much below the &s;urface, no wonder if a heavy military way be much more &s;o. I have heard a traditionary account of this way's pa&s;&s;ing by Stan|ley towards Lanche&s;ter, though I know not how far this may be relied on, but how little of &s;uch military ways appear in &s;ome other places, where it might have been better expected? There is a remarkable tumulus near this way, not far from Raven&s;worth: Be&s;ides which, I ob&s;erved another very con&s;iderable one about a mile from Lanche&s;ter, called the Maiden-Law, and probably the military way has not been far from this tu|mulus. I am &s;urpri&s;ed to find the military way which goes from South-Shields u&s;ually repre&s;ented to pa&s;s near to Durham, &s;ometimes on the ea&s;t and &s;ometimes on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, when there is &s;uch plain de|mon&s;tration not only of the reality of the way, but of the range and tendency of it; but I believe the military way which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have gone from Newca&s;tle to Che&s;ter, and from thence to Watling-&s;treet near Bin|che&s;ter, has occa&s;ioned the mi&s;take. The Gardener at Cou&s;in's hou&s;e, &s;aid he had ob&s;erved when he wrought thereabouts, this military way from Newca&s;tle to Che&s;ter, and that it lay to the we&s;t of the pre&s;ent high|way through the &s;ell. Dr Hunter was po&s;itive he had ob&s;erved the &s;ame way upon the &s;ell, as al&s;o &s;ome re|maining track of a <HI>via vicinalis</HI> beyond Che&s;ter, between Binche&s;ter and Brancepeth ca&s;tle, (as I remember) pointing towards Che&s;ter, which he therefore concluded mu&s;t have gone that way.&mdash;<HI>Hor&s;ley.</HI></P>
<P>1750. Wreken Dyke is the boundary between Gate&s;head fell and Eighton common, and may be &s;een as it pa&s;&s;es through Eighton quarries, and at the north end of the village of Eighton, from thence down one of lord Raven&s;worth's new inclo&s;ures, and cro&s;&s;ing the high road leading to Newca&s;tle from Che&s;ter, it appears plain in an inclo&s;ure on the we&s;t &s;ide of the road, the ridge not having been ploughed, and it is partly over run with broom, and there is a foot path on the ridge of it.</P>

It con&s;i&s;ts of firm gravel and &s;and, very hard and compact, &s;o as to make a very good way at this time, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year.

This place, though not above three miles from Che&s;ter-in-the-Street and four from Lanche&s;ter, &s;eems to have had no immediate communica|tion with either of them, no ve&s;tigia of any paved way appearing upon the moors adjoining, and being &s;ituated as Che&s;ter it&s;elf, at the termination of a military way, gives me convincing rea&s;on to believe the u&s;e of each has been the &s;ame, namely, to guard herds of cattle at gra&s;s, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the two garri&s;ons at South-Shields and <HI>Pons Aelij,</HI> and for victualling &s;hips re&s;orting to the fir&s;t place: Whereas had its elevated &s;ituation been intended to form a <HI>ca&s;trum ex|ploratorium,</HI> then mu&s;t the advantage of paved ways to the next &s;tation have been nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;peedy conveyance of intelligence. Though this la&s;t mi|litary way bears the names of Wreken Dyke, I am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from Binche&s;ter to South Shields, e&s;pecially from the authority of Ralph Higden, who &s;ays, that Wreken Dyke, or Reken Dyke, pa&s;&s;ed from the we&s;t of England and ended at Tinemouth.

<P>After the learned definitions given in the notes on the etymology of Wreken Dyke, it may appear pre&s;umptuous to offer new conjectures; but there is a proba|bility that this military road was re&s;tored by the Danes on their making the river Tyne their frequent harbour, for the more ea&s;y communication with the country, and victualling their navy: At their &s;everal &s;tationary intervals where &s;entries were placed, their &s;tandard, &s;o well known in ancient writings by the name of

We propo&s;ed the like etymology for the name of Raven&s;worth, much le&s;s corrupted from Raf|fens-weath, the northern language, and it remains with the reader to determine, whether, &s;upported by each other, together with the tumuli of Raven&s;worth and Maiden Law, the conjecture is probable, or at lea&s;t not altogether vague.</P>

<P>The Staiths called FATFIELD STAITHS exhibit a bu&s;y &s;cene in the coal trade, where the keels come up to receive their loading for the port of Sunderland. The village is very populous. Near this place is an eminence called the Worm Hill, which tradition &s;ays was once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an enormous &s;erpent, that wound its hor|rid body round the ba&s;e; that it de&s;troyed much provi&s;ion, and u&s;ed to infe&s;t the Lambton e&s;tate, till &s;ome hero of that family engaged it, ca&s;ed in armour &s;et with razors, and when it would have cru&s;hed the combatant by enfolding him, &s;u&s;tain|ing a thou&s;and wounds, fell at la&s;t by his falchion. We thought to have found intrenchments round this mount, and that the fable had reference to &s;ome Dani&s;h troop who kept the place as a &s;tation, from whence they could commit depreda|tions on the country, and that the &s;tory of the hero imported &s;ome chief per&s;on|age's victory over a public enemy: But there is not the lea&s;t trace of any &s;uch matter, and the whole miraculous tale has no other evidence than the memories of old women.

The villains here were under &s;evere duties; for be&s;ides various kinds of labour to be performed for the lord in the field, they rendered money payments at the bi&s;hop's exchequer, and 16d. each for averpennys, which appears to be a payment in lieu of royal averages <Q>quietum e&s;&s;e de diver&s;is denariis pro averagiis dom. regis,</Q> a &s;ervice by hor&s;e and carriage for conveying the &s;overeign's ammunition and baggage in time of war, &amp;c. The vil|lains laboured three days in each week throughout the whole year, excepting the weeks of Ea&s;ter and Whit&s;untide, and thirteen days at Chri&s;tmas, and among&s;t them to build a hou&s;e for the lord in his park, forty feet long and fifteen broad, for which they were exempt from one-third of their averpennys: They were pri|vileged at the fairs of St Cuthbert to &s;et up one booth or hut for every two villains,
<PB N="495" REF="523">
of whom there were twenty-two in Boldon. The cotmanni or cottagers wrought only two days in each week. The pinder here held twelve acres of land in right of his office, and had a thrave of corn from every carucate of land, rendering to the lord yearly twenty-four hens and five hundred eggs: The whole vill paid &s;eventeen &s;hillings cornage, and provided a milch cow for the hou&s;ehold. The deme&s;ne lands were in farm, and rendered rent in grain, as bread, corn, oats, and barley. In Hatfield's Survey we find the names of the free tenants, among whom is John Hedworth, who &s;erved on the bi&s;hop's emba&s;&s;ies, and was bound to bring up to Durham the bi&s;hop's rents of his manor of Werehall. Peter del Hay held lands, and the lord Neville had the vill of Newton. The bond &s;ervices vary a little from tho&s;e &s;et forth in Boldon Book; there are malt-pennys and bathe-&s;ylver mentioned: This is the fir&s;t time the bathe-&s;ylver has occured in the progre&s;s of the work, and it is difficult to a&s;certain what it was. Buthena is defined to im|ply a park for cattle, and bothena a barony, lord&s;hip, or &s;heriffwick; whether it applied to either of the&s;e, we confe&s;s our&s;elves at a lo&s;s; perhaps it was &s;tallage-money for the booths or &s;talls allowed to many of the villains at St Cuthbert's fairs in the city.</P>
<P>In bi&s;hop Bury's time, Alicia de Marrays died &s;ei&s;ed of lands in We&s;t Boldon; and Allan Gategant held certain lands there called Fadrele&s;s Hou&s;es, held <HI>in capite</HI> by homage and fealty. By an inqui&s;ition taken on the death of Richard de Hethe|worth, or Hedworth, in the &s;econd year of bi&s;hop Fordham, it appears he died &s;ei&s;ed of various tenements in Boldon, viz. Scots Hou&s;e and all the lands and tenements that theretofore belonged to Ade Rhodes, Gilbert de Boldon, Roger de Burdon, Ambro&s;e de Southwyk, Ade de Clevedon, and Matilda Gray. This fa|mily retained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Boldon for many generations. The family of Claxtons held lands there called Strothers-field, touching which, in the time of bi&s;hop Neville, Ralph earl of We&s;tmoreland came and claimed oyer of an inqui&s;i|tion taken by the e&s;cheator on the death of William Claxton, wherein Strother|field in We&s;t Boldon, was found to be held of the bi&s;hop <HI>in capite,</HI> and by others

Having a grant from the king of &s;ome lands for an endowment of the abbey, he went to Rome and procured the pope's bull for a further &s;ecurity in the year 680. At his return the pope ordered John the precentor to go along with him, and teach him and his monks the man|ner of &s;inging u&s;ed at St Peter's in Rome. John, at his coming hither, performed this part of his commi&s;|&s;ion, taught the mona&s;tery church mu&s;ic, and pricked out a cour&s;e for the choir for a whole year.

Benedict in the notes. In Bentham's Hi&s;tory of Ely, p. 21, we are informed the workmen employed in this edifice were brought by Benedict from France, and that within the compa&s;s of a year after the foundation was laid, he cau&s;ed the roof to be put on, and divine &s;ervice to be performed in it: He continues, <Q>Af|terwards, when the building was fini&s;hed, he &s;ent over to France for artificers &s;killed in the my&s;tery of making gla&s;s, (an art till that time unknown to the inhabitants of Britain) to glaze the windows both of the porticos and principal parts of the church; which work they not only executed, but taught the Eng|li&s;h nation that mo&s;t u&s;eful art.</Q> We are not informed in what manner the mona&s;tery was re&s;tored, or by whom, after the Dani&s;h deva&s;tations; but when king Malcolm of Scotland made his inroad in the year 1070, he ravaged many parts of this palatinate, and burnt the mona&s;teries of Weremouth and Hartlepool. We have few accounts of the o&s;tium of the Were being frequented by &s;hipping in the&s;e early times, but from the choice of &s;ituations, are induced to believe what led the founders of religious hou&s;es to fix upon Weremouth and Jarrow, was their being the &s;tation of mariners, who in all ages were objects for religious reforma|tion; and yet another and perhaps not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential cau&s;e occurs, they were ac|cu&s;tomed to pre&s;ent gifts for propitiation, which would a&s;&s;i&s;t the maintenance, if not increa&s;e the riches, of the religious &s;ocieties. When Malcolm made that pro|gre&s;s, he found Edgar with his family and followers embarked, and lying in the haven waiting wind and tide, for their voyage to Scotland; and it is more than probable the king's intention was to cover that retreat.

It is wonderful that Turgot, who took the monki&s;h habit at this place, &s;hould not &s;peak of its hi&s;tory during &s;o long a &s;pace of time, as from the incur&s;ion of the Danes to the year 1075, a period of 205 years, or mention the re&s;tored edifice, the return of the &s;ociety, and the de&s;truction made by Malcolm. Thus dark as the long interval remains, we mu&s;t pur&s;ue the facts which he delivers down: Part of the religious &s;ociety of Jarrow (which we are apt to conceive was become too numerous by the monks who were driven from Weremouth &s;eeking refuge there) determined to form a colony, with Aldwin at their head, and &s;ettle in the north, whil&s;t another prepared for a &s;outhern &s;ettlement, headed by Renfred: Aldwin, with his followers, &s;at down at the ruined huo&s;e of Melros, where they &s;uffered much per&s;ecution, refu&s;ing to &s;wear allegiance to Malcolm, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that territory <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i. p. 115.

was di&s;plea&s;ed with this emigration, which was not only made without his con&s;ent, but al&s;o militated again&s;t a plan he had formed, though not made public: He di&s;|patched me&s;&s;engers to entreat the return of the northern colony, and wrote letters of invitation; but in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, the me&s;&s;engers were charged with more rigorous commands, and the terrors of excommunication were directed to be an|nounced. On Aldwin's return to this dioce&s;e, in the year 1075, the bi&s;hop placed him at Weremouth. Turgot then tells us <Q>Tunc eccle&s;iam S.

Lambard &s;till creates greater confu&s;ion in the matter, who &s;ays, <Q>Aldwyn of Eve&s;ham, or Winchecombe as others &s;ay, accompanied with two or thre other, toke the place of by&s;hop Walchers guifte, covered the churche, and &s;ome|what repaired the hou&s;e, and &s;toared it with companie: But before they had longe re&s;ted theare, the de&s;truction which William the Conquerour made in the north countrye, and the fire of Malcolme kinge of Scottes came upon theim, and cau&s;ed theim to for&s;ake the place for a &s;ea&s;on. And when they ment to have returned, William, then bi&s;hop of Durham, compelled them to come to Durham abbay, and made the hou&s;e and cell &s;ubject to the &s;ame,</Q> &amp;c. This account de&s;troys every degree of chronology, for bi&s;hop Walcher did not come to the See till 1072. To &s;olve the difficulty, it &s;eems likely there were two religious edifices, one north of Were, de&s;troyed by the Danes, of which Jarrow was a filia|tion, and another erected perhaps after that de&s;truction, on the &s;outh of Were, which Malcolm ruined: And this conjecture is not totally groundle&s;s; for Tanner, in his Notitia <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Under the title Bi&s;hopweremouth.</P>

<P>HILTON CASTLE, &s;eated in a vale on the river Were, is graced with many hanging woods and ornamental plantations, in long extended avenues; and though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing few beauties of &s;ituation, and much &s;hut up from pro&s;pect, yet may be ju&s;tly called a plea&s;ing retirement. Part of the ancient baronial hou&s;e re|mains, but it has undergone &s;uch reformations and changes, that it is now difficult to a&s;certain the date of any di&s;tinct part of the pre&s;ent edifice. The center of the we&s;t front con&s;i&s;ts of the great entrance and gateway, defended by &s;quare project|ing turrets, crowned with hanging parapets which cro&s;s the angles tran&s;ver&s;ly, like tho&s;e on the old towers at Lumley, &s;o as to make an aperture over each face of the &s;quare, for the purpo&s;e of annoying a&s;&s;ailants. This form indicates that tho&s;e parts of the two ca&s;tles were nearly of the &s;ame date. The center is flanked with circular turrets, which now garni&s;h the wings of the building, of modern con&s;truc|tion: The battlements of the ancient part are ornamented with human figures. In the center are &s;everal &s;hields of arms, but di&s;po&s;ed &s;o irregularly as to te&s;tify the pre&s;ent building did not fir&s;t receive them.

On the turrets are &s;everal &s;hields of arms, among which are tho&s;e of Surtees and Bowes. The ea&s;t front has the ancient tower in the center, with a &s;quare projecting front without turrets.

<P><PB N="510" REF="539">The following account of the Hiltons is taken from a manu&s;cript in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Mu&s;graves of Hayton:</P>
<P><Q>Three hundred years before the Conque&s;t, even in the reign of king Athel&s;tan, one of the Saxon monarchs, the family of Hyltons were &s;ettled in England in great reputation, as appears by a certain in&s;cription at Hartlepool. That upon the coming over of William the Conqueror, Lancelot de Hylton, with his two &s;ons Henry and Robert, e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e and joined him; but that Lancelot was &s;lain at Fever&s;ham in Kent. That to the elder &s;on Henry, the Conqueror gave a large tract of land on the banks of the river Were, not far from Were&s;|mouth; a reward for his own and his father's valour. That this Henry built Hylton ca&s;tle in the year 1072, was one of the deputies that treated with the Conqueror concerning the four northern counties, and in the &s;ervice of that prince, was at la&s;t &s;lain in Normandy. That in the reign of Edward III. John Hylton, who &s;ent four of his &s;ons into the wars of France, under the command of the Black Prince, was fir&s;t created baron of Hylton ca&s;tle, for his gallant defence of it again&s;t the Scots incur&s;ions. That this peerage continued in the family for &s;even &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, till at la&s;t it was forfeited upon account of &s;ome un|guarded words, whereof the then bi&s;hop of Durham gave the court information, which William the &s;eventh and la&s;t baron of the family &s;poke again&s;t the queen, and her favourite De Le Pole. That upon the death of this William, which was thought to have been violent, the crown &s;eizing upon the e&s;tate, gave it to the informing bi&s;hop, who held it for &s;ome time, to the utter exclu&s;ion of the right|ful heir. That in proce&s;s of time however, Lancelot, the grand&s;on to the afore&s;aid William, was re&s;tored to his ca&s;tle and part of his e&s;tate, no more of it indeed than what the bi&s;hop thought fit to allow him under this hard condition, that he and his heirs for ever &s;hould hold the moiety that was given them under certain rents and &s;ervices to the Sec of Durham, and have the title of barons (but barons to the bi&s;hopric) annexed to their inheritance; and in that condi|tion it has continued ever &s;ince. In the pedigree of the Hyltons there are &s;eve|ral names remarkable for their learning and piety, but almo&s;t innumerable tho&s;e highly renowned for their martial deeds. War &s;eems to have been the plea&s;ure, genius, and recreation of the Hyltons, nor has any family been more lavi&s;h of their blood in defence of their country's cau&s;e. Since the time of the Conque&s;t it is remarked of the Hyltons, that one was &s;lain at Fever&s;ham in Kent, one in Normandy, one at Mentz in France, three in the holy wars under Richard I. one in the &s;ame under Edward I. three at the battle of Bourdeaux, under the Black Prince, one at Agincourt, two at Berwick upon Tweed again&s;t the Scots, two at the battle of St Albans, five at Market Bo&s;worth, and four at Flodden Field.</Q></P>

The chancel was repaired and greatly altered by Mr Smith, who came to this rectory in 1704. The altar rails form a &s;quare, thereby admitting many communicants to the &s;ervice: The inclo&s;ure is &s;ix paces in length, and three wide &s;teps a&s;cend to the rail; the whole is neatly wain&s;cotted, and the ea&s;t end ornamented with taber|nacle work. The ea&s;t window is under a pointed arch, and formed of five lights;
<PB N="513" REF="542">
there are four &s;outh windows, and one to the north, having two lights each, under pointed arches. From the &s;teps, the chancel on each &s;ide is double &s;talled with oak, in the cathedral form, ornamented with a carved entablature in open work. The entrance from the nave is under a lofty pointed arch, ri&s;ing from a clu&s;ter of &s;mall round pila&s;ters; clo&s;ed with &s;talls and a hand&s;ome wood &s;creen, &s;uitable to the re&s;t of the chancel. The whole length of the chancel within the rails and with|out is nineteen paces. The nave hath two regular ailes, formed by two rows of three round columns, about fourteen feet in height, uniform, with rolls for capitals, &s;upporting circular arches; there are four upper windows on each &s;ide: The nave and ailes together are fifteen paces in width, and &s;ixteen in length, regularly &s;talled with oak, and carved with fleur-de-lis. The pulpit is lofty, and well ornamented: Near it, in the end wall of the north aile, is a monument, having the effigy of a man in armour to the wai&s;t, with elevated hands, in high relief; belonging, as it is pre|&s;umed, to one of the family of Middleton. The tower ri&s;es on &s;hort round pila&s;ters, &s;upporting pointed arches on the &s;ides, and a lofty circular arch towards the nave. The we&s;t end of the nave is galleried. By the various modes of archi|tecture which are &s;een in this edifice, it is evident, alterations have taken place at different periods, but that the old Saxon mode was the original one.</P>

<P>It hath been a&s;&s;erted by various writers, that Sunderland, either was &s;o united with Weremouth, or &s;o in&s;ignificant in Camden's time, as cau&s;ed him not to mention it. Leland, in his Itinerary, takes no note of it. It is mo&s;t probable the general name of Weremouth prevailed &s;o much as occa&s;ioned Sunderland to e&s;cape the learned writers ob&s;ervation, e&s;pecially as in the charter granted by bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey, the borough had the name of Weremouth.</P>
<P>That charter is addre&s;&s;ed, among other per&s;onages, as priors, archdeacons, &amp;c. to the bi&s;hop's barons, and grants, That the burge&s;&s;es of Weremouth &s;hould enjoy the like liberties and free-cu&s;toms, as the burge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle: That all pleas ari&s;ing within the borough, except tho&s;e of the crown, &s;hould be determined there. Di&s;|putes between tho&s;e plying with &s;hips at that port, and merchants to whom the cargoes were &s;old, to be determined within the time of the third influx of the tide, that navigation might not be retarded: Merchandize brought by &s;ea to be landed before &s;ale, except &s;alt and herrings.

A burge&s;s might &s;ell his lands and go where he plea&s;ed, if no claim was &s;ub&s;i&s;ting again&s;t him. If a burge&s;s was complained again&s;t, in a matter where battle ought to be waged, by a villain, he was to make defence by thirty-&s;ix men, unle&s;s the value in &s;uit was one hundred pounds, or the crime im|puted to him ought to be tried by battle.

A burge&s;s might bring in his corn from the country when he plea&s;ed, except at a time of prohibition or em|bargo. Whatever a burge&s;s bought he might &s;ell without licence of the lord or con&s;ent of his heir. Every burge&s;s had liberty to buy timber and &s;ire wood equally with the burge&s;&s;es of Durham.

<P><PB N="521" REF="550">From all the records referred to it will appear, that it was not till after the &s;ta|tute of Henry VIII. by which the palatine juri&s;diction was re&s;trained and mutilated, Sunderland became a place of con&s;iderable note, and had its officers of di&s;tinction and police: Hartlepool, whil&s;t the bi&s;hop of Durham had naval armaments, was the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the province, where the bi&s;hop had his officers, and received the fees, dues, and duties which in other ports were paid to the king.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Morton, de&s;irous of encouraging the trade of Sunderland, in the year 1634, granted a charter of incorporation to the burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants, by the title of mayor, twelve aldermen, and commonalty of the borough of Sunderland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Hunt. penes dec. &amp; cap. Dun.</NOTE>. The charter &s;tates, that Sunderland had beyond the memory of man been an an|cient borough, known by the name of the new borough of Weremouth, contain|ing in it&s;elf a certain part, where &s;hips had plyed, bringing and carrying merchan|dize, as well to and from foreign parts, as from other ports of this kingdom: The articles of exportation therein &s;pecified are &s;ea coals, grind-&s;tones, rub-&s;tones, and whet-&s;tones. It al&s;o &s;tates, that the trade was then greatly increa&s;ed by the mul|titude of &s;hips re&s;orting thither; and that the borough anciently enjoyed divers liberties and free cu&s;toms, as well by pre&s;cription as by virtue of &s;undry charters from the bi&s;hops of Durham, confirmed to them by the crown; which from de|fect in form proved in&s;ufficient for the &s;upport of the ancient liberties, privileges, and free cu&s;toms of the borough, or to that effect. This charter granted the market and fairs, and appointed the mayor for the time being clerk of the market.</P>
<P><PB N="522" REF="551">For rea&s;ons not pointed out to us, this charter was &s;uffered to expire; perhaps the mi&s;eries of tho&s;e times, and the dreadful convul&s;ions of the &s;tate, cau&s;ed it to be neglected. But though the members of the incorporation did not long pre&s;erve their juri&s;diction, the privileges granted to the inhabitants were a&s;&s;umed, and main|tained in &s;everal &s;uits at law, particularly touching the herbage of the town-moor, with the &s;oil thereof: This common con&s;i&s;ts of about &s;eventy or eighty acres only. In the ca&s;e of Hicks ver&s;us Clerk, Lev. 2d part. p. 252, the cu&s;tom is &s;tated, that <Q>Sunderland is an ancient borough, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve capital burge&s;&s;es, called burge&s;&s;es, and twelve inferior burge&s;&s;es, called &s;tallingers, and that each freeman occupying a hou&s;e had commonage for two hor&s;es and four cows, and each &s;tal|linger for one cow; and that the widow of a freeman or &s;tallinger, being an in|habitant, had the like commonage after the hu&s;band's death.</Q> Upon error the judgment e&s;tabli&s;hing this cu&s;tom was affirmed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See a bill brought in the court of exchequer in the year 1729 or thereabouts, by Sir William Middleton and William Etterick of Barnes, again&s;t William Etterick of Silk&s;worth, and &s;ome other people of Sunder|land, and the depo&s;itions in the cau&s;e, e&s;pecially the depo&s;ition of the defendant William Etterick; which will &s;hew a right in the bi&s;hop of Durham to Sunderland town-moor, and that the freemen and &s;tallingers are only entitled to the herbage.&mdash;<HI>Gyll's MSS.</HI></P>

<P>The regal juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Durham being in many in&s;tances removed by the &s;tatute of Henry VIII. the con&s;ervator&s;hip of the river Were and port of Sunderland was ve&s;ted in the powers of the crown, and the nece&s;&s;ary revival of that authority became daily obvious; &s;o that an act of parliament was applied for and obtained in the 3d year of k.

<P>In 1719, Sunderland being increa&s;ed &s;o greatly in population, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the inhabitants to be received to the offices of the church at Were|mouth, an act of parliament was obtained for making the town and town&s;hip of
<PB N="524" REF="553">
Sunderland a di&s;tinct pari&s;h from the pari&s;h of Bi&s;hopweremouth; in the pre|amble of which it is &s;tated, that Sunderland contained &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls and upwards, and that a beautiful church had been erected, with a ve&s;try-room, and a dwelling-hou&s;e for a mini&s;ter or rector to live in, upon a parcel of ground, part of one of the common fields of Sunderland, and within the manor and borough of Sunderland, called the Intack, and had inclo&s;ed or doled out a parcel of ground adjoining thereto for a cemetery or church-yard. By this act Sunderland was made a rectory, the patronage of which &s;hould for ever appertain to the bi&s;hop of Durham. A ve&s;try or a&s;&s;ociation of inhabitants was in&s;tituted by this act, con&s;i&s;t|ing of twenty-four per&s;ons having freehold e&s;tates of the yearly value of 10l. to be cho&s;en by the pari&s;hioners, and to continue in office three years, and &s;o a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to be cho&s;en every three years, in which ve&s;try-men was ve&s;ted a power to make ordinances and by-laws, for the regulation of the new pari&s;h, to be ratified by two ju&s;tices, to appoint a &s;cavenger, and to a&s;&s;e&s;s on e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal, and &s;tock in trade, a &s;ufficient &s;um for the purpo&s;es therein mentioned, and particularly for paying to the rector a yearly &s;tipend of eighty pounds, and to the clerk ten pounds, and a competent &s;um to the &s;cavenger, to be levied by warrant from two or more ju&s;tices of the peace. The rectory to be di&s;charged of fir&s;t-fruits, tenths, procurations, and &s;ynodals; but the tithes of fi&s;h, and of corn and hay growing within the pari&s;h, were re&s;erved for the rectory of Bi&s;hopweremouth, the new rectory taking only Ea&s;ter reckonings, &s;urplice fees, and other &s;mall dues.</P>
<P>The trade of Sunderland is very con&s;iderable: In the De&s;cription of England and Wales, page 265<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Al&s;o England Di&s;played, publi&s;hed by Ru&s;&s;ell and Owen, 1769.</NOTE>, it is thus &s;poken of, <Q>It is a well-built populous &s;ea port town, having a fine church, which the late rector, Mr Newcomb, &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his income in beautifying and adorning. He began by building a dome adjoining to the ea&s;t end, into which he removed the altar, placing it under a canopy of inlaid work, &s;upported in front by two fluted columns of the Corinthian order; but this gentleman died before he had fini&s;hed his intended improvements. From the coal trade the inhabitants derive great wealth: The coal is &s;o remarkable for burning &s;low, that it is &s;aid to make three fires. The port was formerly &s;o &s;hallow, that &s;hips were obliged to take in their lading in the open road, which was &s;ometimes attended with very great danger to the keelmen, who bring the coals down to the &s;hips; on this account the ve&s;&s;els which loaded here, were u&s;ually &s;maller than in the neighbouring ports; but as they ride in the open &s;ea, they no &s;ooner get in their lading than they are ready to &s;ail, which is a con&s;iderable advantage, as they have been known to &s;teer from thence, to deliver their coals at London, to beat up again&s;t the wind in their return, and to get back before the &s;hips at Shields, which were loaden before them, had been able to get over the bar: But this inconvenience has been in a great mea&s;ure removed. The town is much improved and increa&s;ed within the&s;e fifty years. The principal &s;treet is of great length, and of con&s;ider|able breadth, parallel to which runs another, but narrower, be&s;ides a great number of others. The town, with the adjacent hamlets of Bi&s;hopweremouth,
<PB N="525" REF="554">
Bi&s;hopweremouth &s;alt-pans, Monkweremouth, and the north &s;hore &s;ide, contain about twenty thou&s;and inhabitants. Tho&s;e who are delighted with &s;ea pro&s;pects may here &s;ee twenty or thirty &s;ail of &s;hips coming in with a flowing tide, from the coa&s;ting and foreign parts, fifteen or twenty going out on their re&s;pective voyages, and thirty or forty &s;ail at anchor in the road, taking in their cargoes. Here is a very fine pier, which affords a plea&s;ant walk, as well as &s;helter for the &s;hips, and is &s;aid to have co&s;t about 19,000l. They have al&s;o deepened the &s;outh channel, by taking up part of the rock. So great is the trade of Sunder|land, that in 1752, there belonged to this port alone about one hundred and ninety &s;hips, which are chiefly loaden with coals, the &s;taple commodity of the place, and the produce of the adjacent country, whence many people are em|ployed, and great &s;ums brought in. In the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on there are about ten thou&s;and tons of lime and lime-&s;tone, carried from this river, in &s;mall &s;loops of about twenty or thirty tons. It is &s;aid that there were loaded at this port, in 1748, 2497 &s;ail of &s;hips: And in the year 1752, be&s;ides the &s;mall &s;loops already mentioned, <TABLE>

</TABLE> This account is exactly tran&s;cribed from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books of that year, and many of the&s;e &s;hips were from one hundred to five hundred tons burthen. The amount of the duties of goods exported and imported from and to foreign parts com. ann. is about 10,000l. And as it is computed that about 260,000 Winche&s;ter chaldrons of coals are carried coa&s;twi&s;e, whereon there is a duty of five &s;hillings a chaldron on delivery, amounting to 65,000l. the whole revenue ari&s;ing to the crown from the imports, exports, and produce of Sunderland, may be reckoned about 75,003l. per annum, &s;o that po&s;&s;ibly, with re&s;pect to the duty ari&s;ing from it, it may be the &s;ixth, or at lea&s;t the &s;eventh port in the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to the preceding account, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the chief or high &s;treet of Sunderland is nearly a mile in length, the hou&s;es well built with brick; the low &s;treet which runs parallel thereto, and adjoins upon the quay, is narrow and extremely populous: There are &s;ome new &s;treets which run from the upper &s;ide of the high &s;treet, containing &s;everal elegant buildings. In regard to the po|pulation, in the year 1681, there were 83 burials in Bi&s;hopweremouth, which being multiplied by 30, (the average number which hath been found on general calculations of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ths in this county) would make the number of &s;ouls in Were|mouth and Sunderland 2490. The number of burials in Weremouth in the year 2781 was 153, and in Sunderland 382, which on the like calculation, will give
<PB N="526" REF="555">
16,050, to which if we add 4890 for Monkweremouth, the whole number of &s;ouls will be 20,940. By the above account it appears the increa&s;e in population in one century was not le&s;s than 18,450 &s;ouls. The pier which was erected at the mouth of the river, in the coal owners ca&s;e in 1766, before referred to, on the 21&s;t of December, 1765, had co&s;t 50,000l. and would then require 30,000l. more to perfect it. There are 350 ve&s;&s;els and upwards belonging to this port; and from the 5th of July to the 10th of Augu&s;t, 1776, inclu&s;ive, there were cleared at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e 980 &s;ail of &s;hips coal-loaden, and above 100 ve&s;&s;els with lime: 5700 ve&s;&s;els cleared here in one year; and this navigation was performed by 1100 dif|ferent ve&s;&s;els <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Robert Walker's minutes.&mdash;William&s;on comptroller's clerk and deputy cu&s;t.</NOTE>.

No burials are permitted within the church. Above the ve&s;try is a &s;mall parochial library. Be&s;ides this church an elegant chapel was erected by &s;ub&s;cription in the year 1769, dedicated to St John: The mini&s;ter's &s;tipend, with the clerk's fee, and other inferior officers, are paid by the annual rents of the pews, which are farmed out: It has a good organ. Much attention was paid to this laudable in&s;titution by John Thornhill, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who has the right of pre&s;entation for twenty-one years from the time of con&s;ecration. There are al&s;o three di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;es, and one ma&s;s-hou&s;e in this place:

<P>From the populou&s;ne&s;s of the country and narrowne&s;s of the land here, the average rent per acre is from three pounds ten &s;hillings to four pounds.

<P>Authors have made various conjectures touching the derivation of the name of Sunderland, &s;ome in&s;i&s;ting it is the ancient Saxon <HI>Sonderland,</HI> &s;ignifying a particu|lar precinct, with privileges of its own; others, that the name is expre&s;&s;ive of a penin&s;ula, &s;evered and &s;eparated from the main land; and this latter appears the mo&s;t probable, for we &s;ee by the ancient records, that in bi&s;hop Hatfield's time Hynden was a place held by Thomas Menvyll for the plying of &s;hips <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Vide exemplum An. 19 Ed. 3. 1346.

<P>It was the cu&s;tom in tho&s;e days to build their barks in creeks, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>: If the &s;ea, in the beginning of the fourteenth century, formed a creek or bay there, the land on which Sunderland now &s;tands would at high water be almo&s;t totally di&s;&s;evered from the main; and the deep gulleys &s;hew a probability that &s;uch was the ca&s;e: The &s;hore has greatly changed its figure in the cour&s;e of four hundred years, and perhaps &s;ome art was u&s;ed to exclude the &s;ea from that cour&s;e, when the haven of Sunderland grew into fame, and the coal trade began upon Were.</P>
<P><Q>This town has been honoured by our kings in giving title of earl to &s;everal noble families, viz. Emanuel lord Scroope of Bolton, who having been fir&s;t made pre&s;ident of the king's council in the north by king James I. the 6th of February, 1618, was by his &s;on Charles I. created earl of Sunderland, the 19th of June, 1628: But dying without lawful i&s;&s;ue, the &s;ame king created Henry lord Spencer of Wormleighton (in re&s;pect to his approved loyalty and adherence to him in the civil wars then on foot) earl of Sunderland, but he enjoyed his honour a &s;mall time, being &s;lain the &s;ame year at the battle of Newbury, leaving a &s;on Robert earl of Sunderland, who died in 1702, and was &s;ucceeded by Charles earl of Sunderland.</Q></P>

There are three windows to the &s;outh and two to the north in the nave, and the like number north and &s;outh in the choir, with two &s;mall windows to the ea&s;t. The tower is narrow. In the church yard is a &s;tone coffin, with a cover, lately dug up; the cover ridged on the top, as if de&s;igned to &s;hut off any water that might come to it; on one &s;ide of the cover is an in&s;cription with &s;ome Saxon characters, <HI>"Hic jacet Richardus vic. de Sehaiam."</HI> In the li&s;t of incumbents we find two Richards in antiquity, Richard de Overton in 1293, and Richard de Ledyerde in 1451. The probability that this coffin contained the remains of Overton, re&s;ts on the circum&s;tances of the Saxon character and &s;tone coffins being di&s;u&s;ed in &s;o late an aera as the fifteenth century; it was a degree of elegance u&s;ed in an|cient interments to have &s;uch coffins. The body was then wound in fine linens. attired in the mo&s;t honourable ve&s;tments, and laid in &s;pices; things not &s;uited to mean per&s;onages. Richard de Overton was of &s;uch con&s;equence, that in the twenty-&s;econd of Edward I. he had the king's letters of protection <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Prynn, p. 596.</NOTE>.</P>

About eighty years after Kelyng's time, Bernard Gilpin expended upon the rectory and out-buildings near three hundred pounds, as he informs us in his will; but the greate&s;t improvements were made by Mr George Davenport, who continued rector from 1664 to 1677; he rebuilt the man&s;ion-hou&s;e and chapel at his own expence, as well as the garden walls, and repaired the offices.</P>
<P>The church &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground &dagger;, in the center of a &s;quare area, formed by the buildings of the lower part of the town: It is in the form of a cro&s;s, with the tower in the center. The chancel is in length fourteen paces to the &s;teps which a&s;cend to the communion table, and within the rail four paces; the width &s;ix paces. It was &s;ome years ago wain&s;cotted, and &s;talled on each &s;ide, probably by Mr Davenport; for on the north &s;ide is a &s;hield bearing the arms of bi&s;hop <FIGURE>

being much decayed, was removed by the pre&s;ent rector, and the chancel is now fitted up with plai&s;ter in an elegant &s;tile. The &s;talls too, being much decay|ed, have been repaired. The ea&s;t window, con&s;i&s;ting of five lights, is under a pointed arch. There are be&s;ide five other windows in the chancel, one of four lights under a flat arch, three under pointed arches, divided by a &s;mall pila&s;ter, and an adjoining one under a flat arch. The tower &s;tands on four columns, giving an interior &s;quare of &s;ix paces, opening on every &s;ide to form the cro&s;s, and lead to the four limbs of the building. The nave is twenty-four paces in length from the pillars of the &s;quare, and has regular ailes formed by rows of three uniform clu&s;tered columns &s;upporting pointed arches, which at the we&s;tern extremity &s;pring from pila&s;ters of &s;imilar form with the pillars; the whole having great &s;ymmetry, and being of beautiful architecture. The width of the nave, with its ailes, is twelve paces. The &s;ide lights are regular, four on each &s;ide, and modern. The we&s;t window con&s;i&s;ts of five lights under a pointed arch. The reading de&s;k is placed again&s;t the north we&s;t corner pillar, and the pulpit oppo&s;ite to it. There is at pre&s;ent in agitation a plan for rebuilding the &s;talls and &s;eating the church, many of which are now ruinous and much decayed; for removing the old organ, and introducing a new one in a gallery to be erected again&s;t the north wall of the church. The organ is placed in the &s;outh limb of the cro&s;s. The windows at the extremities of the cro&s;s are under pointed arches: One limb of this cro&s;s, but whether the north or &s;outh we cannot a&s;certain, is called Trinity porch. The nave is ceiled and &s;tuccoed, and very clean.</P>
<P>There were two guilds in&s;tituted in this church, one dedicated to the Holy Trinity, the other to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. In the records we find <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cop.

<P>Gilpin's tomb adjoins to an altar tomb, on which lies the effigy of a man in armour, with a &s;hield on his left arm; there is no in&s;cription to denote what per&s;onage was interred here, but tradition reports this is the tomb of Sir John Le Spring, knight, of an ancient re&s;ident family that had taken the local name De le Spring. Collyns, in the 3d volume of his Peerage, page 244, gives the following account of the &s;ame figure: <Q>In the church at Houghton is yet remaining a figure of a knight in armour, in a praying po&s;ture, with his &s;word by his &s;ide, repo&s;ing his head on a cu&s;hion, and at his feet a lion.

<P><PB N="544" REF="575">The reader perhaps expects &s;ome &s;hort anecdotes in this place, of that excellent man Bernard Gilpin; we have &s;elected &s;everal particulars given by William Gilpin, A. M. of Queen's College, Oxford, and others his biographers.</P>
<P>Bernard Gilpin, de&s;cended from a good family in We&s;tmoreland, was born at Kentmire in that county, in the year 1517<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His father's elder brother was &s;lain in the battle of Bo&s;worth field, being heir in the fifth de&s;cent to Richard Gilpin, who in the reign of king John was enfeoffed in the lord&s;hip of Kentmire-hall, by the baron of Kendal, for his &s;ingular &s;ervices.</NOTE>. From his earlie&s;t youth he was inclined to a contemplative life; was thoughtful, re&s;erved, and &s;erious. His fir&s;t years were &s;pent at a public grammar &s;chool, from whence, at the age of &s;ixteen, he was re|moved to Oxford, and entered upon the foundation at Queen's College. He ap|plied him&s;elf clo&s;ely to his &s;tudies, and made a con&s;iderable proficiency in the
<PB N="545" REF="576">
learning of the times. Having determined to &s;tudy divinity, that he might read the &s;criptures, he &s;et out with great indu&s;try to gain a thorough knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages, in which he was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr Neal, a fellow of New College, and afterwards profe&s;&s;or of Hebrew in Oxford.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual term he took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, and about the &s;ame time was elected fellow of his college: But &s;hortly after, on account of his learn|ing, was made choice of among tho&s;e who were appointed to &s;upply the col|lege newly founded by Cardinal Wol&s;ey, and to which he was accordingly re|moved.</P>
<P>As Mr Gilpin was bred in the Roman Catholic religion, he continued a con&s;i|derable time &s;teady to that church, and in defence thereof held a di&s;putation again&s;t Hooper, afterwards bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, in the reign of Henry VIII. But when Edward VI. mounted the throne, Peter Martyr went to Oxford, and there read divinity lectures in a &s;train to which the univer&s;ity had been little accu&s;tomed. Mr Gilpin's credit in the univer&s;ity was become con&s;iderable, the Popi&s;h party were therefore very &s;olicitous to engage him to &s;ide publicly with them; and when they made the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing applications to him for that purpo&s;e, they found his zeal much cooler than their own. He was not indeed &s;atisfied with the Reformers, having had few opportunities of making him&s;elf acquainted with their arguments: But on the other hand he never was bigoted in his religion. While his mind was in &s;o un&s;ettled a condition, he thought him&s;elf but ill qualified to e&s;pou&s;e either &s;ide publicly. Such importunity was however u&s;ed with him, that at length he yielded, and appeared next day again&s;t Peter Martyr.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin entered into the controver&s;y again&s;t his inclination: He re&s;olved to lay a&s;ide, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the temper of a caviller, and to place truth before him as the &s;ole object of his pur&s;uit, from which he was determined not to be drawn a&s;ide either by prejudice or novelty. The di&s;putation was therefore &s;oon over; for Mr Gilpin had nothing of that pride of heart which leads men to de|fend &s;u&s;pected opinions, but gave up his cau&s;e with that grace which always at|tends &s;incerity. He owned publicly that he could not maintain it, and determined to enter into no more controver&s;ies till he gained full information of the &s;ubject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Peter Martyr took notice of this difference of behaviour, and frequently &s;aid, that he was not much troubled either for We&s;ton, Morgan, or the re&s;t, (Gilpin's fellow di&s;putants) <Q>but as for that Gilpin, (&s;aid he) I am very much moved concerning him; for he doeth and &s;peaketh all things with an upright heart. The re&s;t &s;eem to me to be men who are carried away as it were with every bla&s;t of ambition and covetou&s;ne&s;s. But Gilpin, re&s;ting firmly upon gravity and manners, and the te&s;timony of a mo&s;t laudable life, &s;eemeth to honour with his own goodne&s;s the cau&s;e which he undertaketh.</Q> Martyr would likewi&s;e tell his friends, that it was the &s;ubject of his daily prayers, that God would be plea&s;ed to touch the heart of this pious prie&s;t with the knowledge of true religion.</P></NOTE>. He communicated &s;ome of his doubts to bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, who was his mother's uncle, and had always expre&s;&s;ed great regard for him, and al&s;o conferred with Dr Redman <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr J. Redman, or Redmayne, was nearly related to bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, and eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for his learning, the intere&s;ts of which he greatly promoted at Cambridg by his influence and example. Mr A&s;cham, in his Schoolma&s;ter, &s;ays, <Q>At Cambridge, in St John's college, in my time I do know, that not &s;o much the good &s;tatutes, as two gentlemen of worthy memory, Sir John Cheke and Dr Redman, by their own example of excellency in learning, of godline&s;s in living, of diligence in &s;tudying, of councel in exhorting, by good order in all things, did breed up &s;o many learned men in that one college of St John's at one time, as I believe the whole univer&s;ity of Louvain in many years was never able to afford.</Q></P></NOTE>, of who&s;e virtue and learning he had formed an high opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="577">As an academic life afforded the mo&s;t lei&s;ure for &s;tudy, &s;o Mr Gilpin was mo&s;t inclined thereto: He had too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the duty of a clergyman to be unac|quainted with the qualifications requi&s;ite for its di&s;charge, and too mean an opi|nion of him&s;elf to think he was yet ma&s;ter of them: He judged more learning was nece&s;&s;ary in that controver&s;ial age, than he had yet acquired; and his chief argument with his friends, who were continually &s;oliciting him to leave the uni|ver&s;ity, was, that he was not yet &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed in religion him&s;elf, to be a teacher of it to others. The&s;e thoughts continued him at Oxford till the thirty-fifth year of his age; but about that time the vicarage of Norton, in the dioce&s;e of Durham, falling vacant, his friends prevailed upon him to accept it, though not without much difficulty. Accordingly a pre&s;entation pa&s;&s;ed in November, 1552. But before he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his benefice, he was appointed to preach before king Edward VI. who then re&s;ided at Greenwich; Sir William Cecil having ob|tained for him a general licence for preaching.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin having &s;taid &s;ome time in London, repaired to his pari&s;h, and imme|diately entered upon the duties of his function. He failed not as occa&s;ions of|fered, to u&s;e the king's licence in other parts of the country; but his own pari&s;h he con&s;idered as the place where his chief care was due. Here he made it his principal endeavour to inculcate moral virtue, and to di&s;&s;uade from tho&s;e vices which he ob&s;erved mo&s;t prevalent. He &s;eldom handled controverted points, being afraid, le&s;t endeavouring to in&s;truct, he might mi&s;lead. At length he thought he had engaged too &s;oon in his office, and that he could not properly di&s;charge the duties of it; his mind was not &s;atisfied, whil&s;t he merely gave his hearers moral in|&s;tructions, over&s;pread as the country was with di&s;puted articles of faith, and he conceived he acted improperly in pretending to be a teacher of religion, if he was unable to oppo&s;e the prevalent errors. The&s;e thoughts made every day a greater impre&s;&s;ion upon him, and at length growing quite unhappy, he wrote an account of his &s;ituation of mind to bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, who was then in the Tower. The prelate thereupon advi&s;ed Mr Gilpin to provide a tru&s;ty curate for his pari&s;h, and to &s;pend a year or two in Germany, France, and Holland, by which means he might have an opportunity of conver&s;ing with &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent pro|fe&s;&s;ors, both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts. This advice gave Gilpin much &s;atisfaction; for a conference with &s;ome of the learned men abroad was what he had long earne&s;tly de&s;ired. His principal objection to the &s;cheme was, that it would prove too expen&s;ive: But as to that, Tun&s;tall wrote to him, that his living would do &s;omething towards his maintenance, and he would &s;upply deficiences. This, how|ever, did not remove the difficulty; Mr Gilpin's notions of clerical duty were &s;o &s;trict, that he thought no excu&s;e could ju&s;tify non-re&s;idence for &s;o con&s;iderable a time as he intended to be abroad. He could not, therefore, think of &s;upporting him&s;elf with any part of the income of his living. He was determined to go abroad, and re&s;olved, if he &s;taid the &s;horter time, to rely only upon his own frugal
<PB N="547" REF="578">
management of the little money he had, and to leave the re&s;t to the bi&s;hop's genero&s;ity. Accordingly he re&s;igned his living in favour of a worthy man, with who&s;e abilities and character he was well acquainted, and then &s;et out for London, to receive his la&s;t orders from the bi&s;hop, and to embark. The account of his re|&s;ignation got to town before him, and gave Tun&s;tall, who was anxious for his kin&s;man's thriving in the world, great concern. "Here are your friends," &s;aid he, <Q>endeavouring to provide for you, and you are taking every method to fru&s;trate their wi&s;hes: But be warned; by the&s;e cour&s;es you will pre&s;ently bring your&s;elf to a mor&s;el of bread.</Q> Mr Gilpin begged the bi&s;hop would attribute what he had done to a &s;crupulous con&s;cience, which would not permit him to act otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Before he took leave of the bi&s;hop, the latter put into Mr Gilpin's hands a treati&s;e he had written upon the Euchari&s;t, de&s;iring he would cau&s;e it to be printed under his in&s;pection at Paris. Soon after which he embarked for Holland, and upon his landing, went immediately to Mechlin, to vi&s;it his brother George, who was at that time pur&s;uing his &s;tudies there. But after a few weeks he went to Louvain, where he re&s;olved to &s;ettle for &s;ome time. He made frequent excur&s;ions to Antwerp, Ghent, Bru&s;&s;els, and other places in the Low Countries; where he &s;pent &s;ome weeks with men of reputation, who held both &s;ides of the controver&s;ial tenets; but he made Louvain his chief place of re&s;idence, for which city he al|ways expre&s;&s;ed a more than common affection. Louvain was then one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed places for &s;tudents in divinity; &s;ome eminent divines on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion re&s;ided there, and the mo&s;t important topics of religion were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with great freedom.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin's fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s there was to get him&s;elf introduced to tho&s;e of emi|nence for learning; to whom his own addre&s;s and attainments were no mean re|commendations. He was pre&s;ent at all public readings and di&s;putations; commit|ted every thing material to writing; re-examined all his opinions; propo&s;ed his doubts in private to his friends; and in every re&s;pect made the be&s;t u&s;e of his time.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was thus pro&s;ecuting his &s;tudies, he and the Prote&s;tants in tho&s;e parts were alarmed with the melancholy news of the death of king Edward, the un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempt in favour of lady Jane, and the acce&s;&s;ion of queen Mary: But it came attended with one agreeable circum&s;tance; an account of bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall's relea&s;e from the Tower, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in his bi&s;hopric. Soon afterwards Mr Gilpin received a letter from his brother George, intreating him to come to Mechlin, to confer on an affair of importance. On his arrival he found his bro|ther had received a letter from the bi&s;hop, informing him, that he had found a benefice of con&s;iderable value vacant in his dioce&s;e, which he wi&s;hed he could per|&s;uade his brother Bernard to accept, imagining he might by this time have got over his former &s;cruples: And accordingly George u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours for this purpo&s;e, but without effect; Bernard continuing inflexible in his re&s;olution, not to accept of any benefice without di&s;charging the duties of it. He therefore returned to Louvain; but, however, thought it incumbent on him to give the bi&s;hop his rea&s;ons for not accepting his kind offer. The bi&s;hop was not offended
<PB N="548" REF="579">
at this letter; for the unaffected piety of it di&s;armed all re&s;entment, and led him rather to admire a behaviour, in which the motives of con&s;cience &s;hewed them|&s;elves &s;o &s;uperior to tho&s;e of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin continued &s;ome time longer at Louvain, daily improving in religious knowledge. But while he &s;taid in the Low Countries, he was greatly affected with the melancholy &s;ight of crouds of his dejected countrymen arriving daily in tho&s;e parts, to avoid the bloody per&s;ecution then carrying on in England. It gave him, however, &s;ome plea&s;ure to find, though he was unable per&s;onally to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, yet his acquaintance in the country furni&s;hed him with the means of being u&s;eful to many of them by his recommendations.</P>
<P>When he had been about two years in Flanders he left Louvain, and went to Paris, where his fir&s;t care was printing the bi&s;hop's book, which he performed en|tirely to his &s;atisfaction. During his &s;tay at Paris he lodged with Va&s;co&s;an, an eminent printer, to whom he had been recommended by his friends in the Nether|lands. This learned man &s;hewed him great regard, did him many friendly offices, and introduced him to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons in the city.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin having &s;pent three years abroad, returned into England in 1556, whil&s;t the per&s;ecution was &s;till carrying on again&s;t the Prote&s;tants. Bi&s;hop Tun|&s;tall received his kin&s;man with great kindne&s;s, and &s;oon after his arrival gave him the archdeaconry of Durham, to which the rectory of Ea&s;ington was annexed. He immediately repaired to his pari&s;h, where he preached with great boldne&s;s again&s;t the vices, errors, and corruptions of the times; and by virtue of his office of archdeacon, he al&s;o took great pains to reform the manners of the clergy. His free reproofs &s;oon rou&s;ed the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of tho&s;e parts again&s;t him, and put them upon every method in their power to remove &s;o inconvenient an enquirer. The popular clamour among&s;t them was, that Gilpin was an enemy to the church, a &s;candalizer of the clergy, and a preacher of fal&s;e doctrines; and that religion mu&s;t &s;uffer from the here&s;ies he was daily uttering, if he was &s;uffered any longer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Some found great fault, for that I preached repentance and &s;alvation by Chri&s;t; and did not make whole &s;ermons, as they did, about tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, purgatory, holy water, images, prayers to &s;aints, and &s;uch like.</Q></P>

</FIGURE></P></NOTE>. In &s;hort, a charge of here&s;y, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen articles, was drawn up again&s;t him, and he was accu&s;ed in form before the bi&s;hop of Durham. But Tun&s;tall, who was much practi&s;ed in the world, ea&s;ily found a method of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e in &s;uch a manner as to protect his nephew, without endangering him&s;elf. The malice of his enemies could not re&s;t, and they created him &s;o much trouble, that not being able to undergo the fatigue of duty, he begged leave of the bi&s;hop to re&s;ign either the archdeaconry or his pari&s;h, which his lord&s;hip thought fit: To which the bi&s;hop an&s;wered, that the income of the former was not a &s;upport without the latter, and that he could not con&s;ent to their being &s;eparated. Upon this Mr Gilpin re|&s;igned both of them; but the bi&s;hop &s;oon after pre&s;ented him with the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring.</P>
<P>This exten&s;ive rectory, containing no le&s;s than fourteen villages, had been as much neglected in that dark age, as the cures in the north then generally were.
<PB N="549" REF="580">
All ancient cu&s;toms and ceremonies were carried higher than in mo&s;t other places, and were con&s;idered as the e&s;&s;entials of religion. And it is &s;aid, through the de|&s;igned neglect of bi&s;hops and ju&s;tices of the peace, king Edward's proclamations for a change of wor&s;hip had not even been heard of in this part of the king|dom, at the time of that prince's death.</P>
<P>Such was the condition of the pari&s;h of Houghton when it was committed to the care of Mr Gilpin; de&s;cribed by his biographers and other writers, to be then a wa&s;te &s;o mi&s;erably uncultivated, that the greate&s;t indu&s;try &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to bring it into any kind of order; and the greate&s;t re&s;olution was requi&s;ite in the at|tempt. But when the good of mankind was concerned, this true chri&s;tian mini|&s;ter had re&s;olution to attempt whatever indu&s;try could accompli&s;h. He was grieved to &s;ee ignorance and vice prevail: But he did not de&s;pair. The people crouded about him, and heard him with great attention, perceiving him to be a teacher of a very different kind from tho&s;e to whom they had been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>When Mr Gilpin took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Houghton, he found the par&s;onage-hou&s;e gone &s;o to decay, that he could not re&s;ide in it; part of it was &s;itted up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible for his reception, but he continued improving and enlarging it till it be|came &s;uitable to his ho&s;pitable temper, a proper habitation for a man who never intended to keep what he had, to him&s;elf. Soon after his acceptance of the rectory
<PB N="550" REF="581">
of Houghton, Tun&s;tall urged him to accept of a &s;tall then vacant in the cathedral church of Durham, telling him, that there lay not the &s;ame objection to this as to the archdeaconry, it being quite a &s;inecure, and therefore he would have no rea|&s;onable pretence for refu&s;ing it. But Mr Gilpin, unwilling to accept it, told the bi&s;hop, that by his bounty he had already more wealth, than, he was afraid, he &s;hould give a good account of. He begged, therefore, he might not have an ad|ditional charge, but that his lord&s;hip would rather be&s;tow this preferment on one by whom it was more wanted.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin now lived in a retired manner, and gave no immediate offence to the clergy; the experience he had of their temper made him more re&s;erved. Indeed he u&s;ed more caution than he could afterwards approve; for in his future life he would often tax his behaviour at this time with weakne&s;s and cowardice. But all his caution was ineffectual; for he was &s;oon formally accu&s;ed before the bi&s;hop of Durham, who again found means to protect him. The malice of his enemies &s;uc|ceeded in part; for Tun&s;tall's favour from this time vi&s;ibly declined, and he &s;truck him out of his will, of which he had before made him the executor. This lo&s;s gave Mr Gilpin little concern: He was &s;orry, indeed, to &s;ee the bi&s;hop di&s;gu&s;ted; he acknowledged his great obligations to him; and would have given up any thing to have him &s;atisfied, except his con&s;cience. But good con&s;cience, he was a&s;&s;ured, was his be&s;t friend; and he was re&s;olved not to part with it for any mortal friend upon earth.</P>
<P>His enemies, in the mean time, were not thus &s;ilenced. Enraged at this &s;econd defeat, they cau&s;ed thirty-two articles to be drawn up again&s;t him in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, and laid before Bonner bi&s;hop of London. Here they went the right way to work: Bonner was a man &s;uited to their purpo&s;e; and accordingly gave im|mediate orders for his apprehen&s;ion. Mr Gilpin being no &s;tranger to the burn|ing zeal of the bi&s;hop of London, had no &s;ooner notice of the per&s;ecution, than he prepared for martyrdom: He cau&s;ed a long garment to be provided, that he might go in the more decent manner to the &s;take, and &s;et out for London. In his way thither he broke his leg, which put a &s;top for &s;ome time to his journey. The per|&s;ons in who&s;e cu&s;tody he was, it is &s;aid, took occa&s;ion from thence maliciou&s;ly to retort upon him an ob&s;ervation that he would frequently make, <Q>that nothing happens unto us but what is intended for our good,</Q> a&s;king him, whether he thought his broken leg was &s;o intended? He an&s;wered meekly, he made no que&s;|tion but it was: And indeed &s;o it proved in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e; for before he was able to travel, queen Mary died, and he was &s;et at liberty. Whether all the parti|culars of this &s;tory are true or not, thus much however is certain, that the account of the queen's death met him upon the road, and put a &s;top to any further pro&s;e|cution.</P>
<P>Mr Gilpin being thus providentially re&s;cued from his enemies, returned to Houghton, through crowds of people, expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t joy, and ble&s;&s;ing God for his deliverance. The following year he lo&s;t his friend and relation bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall; but he &s;oon experienced, that worth like his would naturally procure friends. When the popi&s;h bi&s;hops were deprived, the earl of Bedford recommend|ed
<PB N="551" REF="582">
him to queen Elizabeth for the bi&s;hopric of Carli&s;le, and took care that a cong&eacute; d'elire &s;hould be &s;ent down to the dean and chapter for that purpo&s;e: But Mr Gil|pin declined this promotion; and when much pre&s;&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign his rea&s;ons for re|fu&s;ing it, he &s;aid, that if any other bi&s;hopric but Carli&s;le had been offered to him, he po&s;&s;ibly might have accepted it: <Q>But in that dioce&s;e (&s;aid he) I have &s;o many friends and acquaintance, of whom I have not the be&s;t opinion, that I mu&s;t either connive at many irregularities, or draw upon my&s;elf &s;o much hatred, that I &s;hould be le&s;s able to do good there than any one el&s;e.</Q> Mr Gilpin per&s;i&s;t|ing in his refu&s;al, the bi&s;hopric was at length given to Dr Be&s;t. The year after he had an offer made him of the provo&s;t&s;hip of Queen's College in Oxford; which he likewi&s;e declined.</P>
<P>In the mean time Gilpin continued to re&s;ide at Houghton, di&s;charging the duties of his function in the mo&s;t exemplary manner. When he fir&s;t took upon him&s;elf the care of a pari&s;h, he laid it down as a maxim, to do all the good in his power there; and accordingly his whole conduct was only one &s;treight line drawn to this point. He &s;et out with making it his endeavour to gain the affections of his par|i&s;hioners. Many of his papers &s;hew how material a point he con&s;idered this. To &s;ucceed in it, however, he u&s;ed no &s;ervile compliances: He &s;tudied that his means &s;hould be good as well as his end. His behaviour was free without levity, obliging without meanne&s;s, and in&s;inuating without art. He conde&s;cended to the weak, bore with the pa&s;&s;ionate, and complied with the &s;crupulous; and in a truly apo&s;tolic manner, "became all things to all men." By the&s;e means he gained upon his neighbours, and convinced them how heartily he was their friend.</P>
<P>To his humanity and courte&s;y he added an unwearied application to the in|&s;truction of tho&s;e under his care. He was not &s;atisfied with the advice he gave in public, but u&s;ed to teach in private; and brought his pari&s;hioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a mo&s;t engaging manner towards tho&s;e whom he thought well-di&s;po&s;ed: Nay, his very reproof was &s;o conducted, that it &s;eldom gave offence; the becoming gentlene&s;s with which it was urged, made it always appear the effect of friend&s;hip. Thus, with uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity, did he employ him&s;elf in admoni&s;hing the vicious, and encouraging the well-di&s;po&s;ed, by which means, in a few years, he made a greater change in his neighbourhood than could well have been imagined. A remarkable in&s;tance what reformation a &s;ingle man may effect, when he hath the pious purpo&s;e earne&s;tly at heart!</P>
<P>But his hopes were not &s;o much in the pre&s;ent generation, as in the &s;ucceeding. It was an ea&s;ier ta&s;k, he found, to prevent vice than to correct it; to form the young to virtue, than to amend the bad habits of the old: He employed much of his time, therefore, in endeavouring to improve the minds of the younger part of his pari&s;h; &s;uffering none to grow up in ignorance of their duty, but pre&s;&s;ing it as the wi&s;e&s;t part to mix religion with their labour, and amid&s;t the cares of this life, to have a con&s;tant eye upon the next. He attended to every thing which he con|ceived might be of &s;ervice to his pari&s;hioners. He was a&s;&s;iduous to prevent all law &s;uits. His hall, it is &s;aid, was often thronged with people, who came to &s;ubmit their differences to his judgment. He was not much acquainted with law, but
<PB N="552" REF="583">
could decide equitably, and that &s;atisfied: Nor could his &s;overeign's commi&s;&s;ion have given him more weight than his own character. His ho&s;pitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He &s;pent in his family every fortnight forty bu&s;hels of corn, twenty bu&s;hels of malt, and a whole ox, be&s;ides a proportionable quantity of other kinds of provi&s;ion. Strangers and travellers found in his hou&s;e a chearful reception: All were welcome that came; and even their hor&s;es had &s;o much care taken of them, that it was humorou&s;ly &s;aid, <Q>If a hor&s;e was turned loo&s;e in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton's.</Q></P>
<P>Every Sunday, from Michaelmas till Ea&s;ter, was a &s;ort of public day with him. During this &s;ea&s;on he expected to &s;ee all his pari&s;hioners and their families. For their reception he had three tables well covered: The fir&s;t was for gentlemen, the &s;econd for hu&s;bandmen and farmers, and the third for day labourers. This piece of ho&s;pitality he never omitted, even at &s;ea&s;ons when its continuance was rather difficult to him: He thought it his duty, and that was a deciding motive. When he was ab&s;ent from home, no alteration was made in his family expences: The poor were fed as u&s;ual, and his neighbours entertained: And he was always glad of the company of men of merit and learning, who greatly frequented his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When lord Burleigh, then lord trea&s;urer, was &s;ent by queen Elizabeth to tran&s;act &s;ome affairs in Scotland, that celebrated &s;tate&s;man re&s;olved, on his re|turn, to pay a vi&s;it to Mr Gilpin. Amid&s;t the hurry of this journey he could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of &s;eeing a man who&s;e name was every where &s;o re&s;pectfully men|tioned. His free di&s;cour&s;e from the pulpit to king Edward's court, had early re|commended him to this noble per&s;on; from which time the great di&s;tance between them had wholly interrupted their acquaintance. Lord Burleigh's return was &s;o &s;udden, that he had no time to give any notice of his intended vi&s;it. But the oeconomy of &s;o plentiful a hou&s;e as Mr Gilpin's was not ea&s;ily di&s;concerted. He received his noble gue&s;t with &s;o much politene&s;s, and treated him and his whole retinue in &s;o affluent a manner, that the trea&s;urer would often &s;ay, <Q>he could hardly have expected more at Lambeth.</Q></P>
<P>While lord Burleigh &s;taid at Houghton, he took great pains to acquaint him&s;elf with the order and regularity with which every thing was managed. The hou&s;e contained a very large family; and was be&s;ides continually crowded with per&s;ons of all kinds, gentlemen, &s;cholars, workmen, farmers, and poor people: Yet there was never any confu&s;ion; every one was conducted to a proper apartment, and entertained, directed, or relieved, as his particular bu&s;ine&s;s required. He could not but plea&s;e this wi&s;e lord, who was &s;o well acquainted with the effects of order and regularity in the highe&s;t &s;phere, to ob&s;erve them even in this humble one. Here too he &s;aw true &s;implicity of manners, and every &s;ocial virtue regulated by exact prudence. The &s;tate&s;man began to unbend; and he could &s;carcely avoid compar|ing, with a kind of envious eye, the unquiet &s;cenes of vice and vanity at which he was frequently pre&s;ent, with the calmne&s;s of this amiable retreat. At length with reluctance he took his leave; and with all the warmth of affection, em|bracing his much re&s;pected friend, told him, <Q>He had heard great things in his
<PB N="553" REF="584">
commendation, but had now &s;een what far exceeded all that he had heard. If, added he, Mr Gilpin, I can ever be of any &s;ervice to you, at court, or el&s;ewhere, u&s;e me with all freedom as one you may depend on.</Q> When he had got to Rainton-hill, which ri&s;es about a mile from Houghton, and commands the vale, he turned his hor&s;e to take once more a view of the place; and having kept his eye fixed upon it for &s;ome time, his reverie broke out into this exclamation: <Q>There is the enjoyment of life indeed! Who can blame that man for not ac|cepting a bi&s;hopric! What doth he want to make him greater, or happier, or more u&s;eful to mankind!</Q></P>
<P>Mr Gilpin continued to di&s;charge the duties of his mini&s;terial office in the mo&s;t con&s;cientious, benevolent, and laborious manner. But notwith&s;tanding all this painful indu&s;try, and the large &s;cope it had in &s;o extended a pari&s;h, he thought the &s;phere of his benevolence yet too confined. It grieved him to &s;ee in the ad|jacent pari&s;hes &s;o much ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, occa&s;ioned by the &s;hameful neglect of the pa&s;toral care in the clergy of tho&s;e parts. He was induced to &s;upply, as far as he was able, what was wanting in others. For this purpo&s;e every year he regularly vi&s;ited the mo&s;t neglected pari&s;hes in Northumberland, York|&s;hire, Che&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland, and Cumberland; and that his own pari&s;h, in the mean time, might not &s;uffer, he was at the expence of a con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tant. In each place he &s;tayed two or three days; and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay before them, in as plain a way as po&s;&s;ible, the danger of leading wicked, or even carele&s;s lives; explaining to them the nature of true religion; in|&s;tructing them in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and them&s;elves; and &s;hewing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their pre&s;ent, as well as future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As Mr Gilpin had all the warmth of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, though under the direction of a very calm and &s;ober judgment, he never wanted an audience, even in the wilde&s;t parts; where he rou&s;ed many to a &s;en&s;e of religion, who had contracted the mo&s;t inveterate habits of inattention to every thing of a &s;erious nature. Where|ever he came, he u&s;ed to vi&s;it the gaols and places of con&s;inement, few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed mini&s;ter; and by his labours, and af|fectionate manner of behaviour, is &s;aid to have reformed many very abandoned per&s;ons in tho&s;e places. He likewi&s;e employed his intere&s;t for criminals, who&s;e ca&s;es were attended with any hard circum&s;tances, and often procured pardons.</P>
<P>Rede&s;dale and Tinedale, in Northumberland, of all barbarous places in the north, were at that time looked upon to be the mo&s;t barbarous; before the Union, the common theatre where the Scots and Engli&s;h were continually acting their bloody &s;cenes: Inhabited by a kind of de&s;perate banditti, rendered fierce and active by con&s;tant rapine, warfare, and alarms; they lived by theft, and u&s;ed to plunder on both &s;ides of the barrier. In this dreadful country, where no man would then even travel that could help it, Mr Gilpin never failed to &s;pend &s;ome part of the year. He generally cho&s;e the Chri&s;tmas holidays for this journey, becau&s;e he found the people at that &s;ea&s;on di&s;engaged, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled. He had &s;et places for preaching, which were regularly attended. If he came where there
<PB N="554" REF="585">
was a church, he made u&s;e of it; if not, of barns, or any other large building, where crowds of people were &s;ure to follow him, &s;ome for his in&s;tructions, and others for his charity.</P>
<P>The di&s;intere&s;ted pains he took among tho&s;e barbarous people, and the good offices he was always ready to do them, drew from them the warme&s;t and &s;incere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. Indeed he was little le&s;s than adored among them. One in&s;tance that is related, &s;hews how greatly he was revered: By the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of his &s;ervant, his hor&s;es were one day &s;tolen: The news was quickly propagated, and every one expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t indignation at the fact. The thief was rejoicing over his prize, when by the report of the country he found who&s;e hor&s;es he had taken. Terrified at what he had done, he in&s;tantly came trembling back, confe&s;&s;ed the fact, and returned the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We have already &s;poken of Mr Gilpin's generous and ho&s;pitable manner of liv|ing. The value of his rectory was about four hundred pounds a year: An in|come at that time very con&s;iderable, but yet in appearance very unproportionate to the generous things he did: Indeed he could not have done them, unle&s;s his frugality had been equal to his genero&s;ity. His friends, therefore, wondered to find him, amid&s;t his many great and continual expences, entertaining the de&s;ign of building and endowing a grammar &s;chool: A project, however, which his exact oeconomy &s;oon enabled him to accompli&s;h, though the expence of it amounted to upwards of five hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>It would be u&s;ele&s;s to incumber the work with a full tran&s;cript of the &s;tatutes; the following material parts mu&s;t &s;uffice:</P>
<P><Q>When the &s;choole doth want a ma&s;ter the governors may &s;end to Mr Provo&s;t of Queen's Col. Ox. and re|que&s;t him that he would procure &s;ome northerne man in any wi&s;e ma&s;ter of art, either in his own hou&s;e or &s;ome other, &amp;c.</Q> Then follow rules for conducting the &s;chool, &amp;c. and the re&s;trictions upon the ma&s;|ter, <HI>inter al's,</HI> <Q>He &s;hall meddle with and occupy no other temporal livings, &amp;c. &s;hall let his gillie-tithes to the mo&s;t advantage he can, provided that he &s;hall not let his tithes above three years, re&s;erving no le&s;s rent than with the re&s;t belonging to him will make up yearly his 20l. wage; and al&s;o he &s;hall not take any fine before hand. And if any other livings belong to him, he &s;hall farm them forth to others, that they may be no hindrance to his teaching; yet if it &s;o happen that he &s;hall take any &s;piritual living, then he &s;hall not have the benefit of his &s;chool above one year after his induction.</Q> Then followeth an order touching the ma&s;ter's marriage, which is to be with the con&s;ent of both governors and two ju&s;tices of the peace.</P>
<P>Rules concerning the u&s;her follow in this place. <Q>His election &s;hall be wholly in the governors' hands, unle&s;s by &s;pecial authority and direction unto the ma&s;ter there be power granted to him from the governors to choo&s;e,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>There &s;hall be one play day in a week, either Tue&s;day or Thur&s;day, &s;ave only certain days in the &s;pring, for the &s;cholars to exerci&s;e their bowes, in matching either with them&s;elves or &s;trangers, in the Ox|pa&s;ture or in Houghton-moor, &amp;c.</Q> At times of breaking up the &s;cholars <Q>mu&s;t pay to their ma&s;ter every one a penny for <HI>ferelatoc</HI> &s;ilver, and none &s;hall be inforced to give more, but upon their own good will.</Q></P>
<P>"There &s;hall be a regi&s;ter book, &amp;c. which once a year &s;hall be brought to the governors, &amp;c." And then if the governors can charge the ma&s;ter or u&s;her, by proof or te&s;timony <Q>of the country, by the church wardens of Houghton, by the gentlemen, of negligence in teaching, of mi&s;behaviour, of breach of any &s;ta|tute, either to puni&s;h them by fine, &amp;c. or otherwi&s;e, if their faults be intolerable and notorious, to expel them of their livings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Item, there is further of the rents, &amp;c. &s;o much as will yearly find five poor &s;cholars and three poor men or women, allowing them 7d. a week, 7d. over which may be divided, &amp;c.</Q></P>

to flouri&s;h; and there was &s;o great a re&s;ort of young people to it, that in a
<PB N="556" REF="587">
little time the town was not able to accomodate them. He put him&s;elf, therefore,
<PB N="557" REF="588">
to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e, where he &s;eldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children. Some of the&s;e were the &s;ons of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, whom he boarded at ea&s;y rates; but the greater part were poor children, whom he not only educated, but cloathed and maintained: He was likewi&s;e at the expence of boarding in the town many other poor children, &s;everal of whom he brought every year from the different parts where he preached, parti|cularly Rede&s;dale and Tinedale. For the maintenance of poor &s;cholars, whom he &s;ent to the univer&s;ities, he yearly &s;et apart &s;ixty pounds. This &s;um he always ex|pended, and often more. His common allowance to each &s;cholar was about ten pounds a year, which for a &s;ober youth was at that time a very &s;ufficient mainte|nance, &s;o that he never maintained fewer than &s;ix. By his will it appears, that at his death he had nine upon his li&s;t, whom he took care to provide for during their &s;tay at the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>As to his &s;chool, he not only placed able ma&s;ters in it, procured from Oxford, but likewi&s;e con&s;tantly in&s;pected it him&s;elf. And that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of the mo&s;t forward: He would call them his own &s;cholars, &s;end for them often into his &s;tudy,
<PB N="558" REF="589">
and there in&s;truct them him&s;elf. One method u&s;ed by him to fill his &s;chool was a little &s;ingular. Be&s;ides tho&s;e whom he &s;ent from his own &s;chool to the univer&s;i|ties, and there wholly maintained, he likewi&s;e gave to others, who were in circum|&s;tances to do &s;omething for them&s;elves, what farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance they needed. By which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education, who otherwi&s;e would not have done it. He con&s;idered him&s;elf as their proper guardian, and e&s;teemed him&s;elf bound to the public for their being made u&s;eful members of it, as far as it lay in his power. With this view he held a punctual corre&s;pondence with their tutors; and made the youths them&s;elves frequently write to him an account of their &s;tudies. So &s;olicitous indeed was he about them, that once every year he made a journey to the univer&s;ities, to in&s;pect their beha|viour. And this uncommon, care was not unrewarded; for many of his &s;cholars became ornaments to the church, and exemplary in&s;tances of piety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among tho&s;e of note who were educated by him, the&s;e three are particularly mentioned; Henry Ayray, George Carleton, and Hugh Broughton.</P>
<P>Henry Ayray became afterwards provo&s;t of Queen's College in Oxford; where he was in great e&s;teem for his abilities, and exemplary life.</P>
<P>George Carleton was a man of worth and learning, and very de&s;ervedly promoted to the See of Chiche&s;ter. He publi&s;hed &s;everal pieces, which are enumerated by Anthony Wood, and in particular the life of his bene|factor Bernard Gilpin.</P>
<P>Hugh Broughton was a very learned man, and particularly &s;killed in rabbinical learning. Broughton is &s;aid to have been &s;o laboriou&s;ly &s;tudious, that unle&s;s he were prevented by &s;omething very extraordinary, he &s;tudied twelve or fourteen hours, and often &s;ixteen hours a day. He had a conte&s;t with Theodore Beza. He died in 1662, as we are told by the famous Dr Lightfoot, who declares him&s;elf a child in compari&s;on of this great ma&s;ter of Hebrew and rabbinical learning, and mentions an offer that was once made to him of a car|dinal's hat.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Every Thur&s;day throughout the year he cau&s;ed a very large quantity of meat to be dre&s;&s;ed, wholly for the poor; and every day they had what quantity of broth they wanted. Twenty-four of the poore&s;t were his con&s;tant pen&s;ioners. Four times in the year a dinner was provided for them, when they received from his &s;teward a certain quantity of corn, and a &s;um of money; and at Chri&s;tmas they had always an ox divided among them.</P>
<P>In the di&s;tant pari&s;hes where he preached, as well as in his own neighbourhood, his genero&s;ity and benevolence were continually &s;hewing them&s;elves; particularly in the de&s;olate parts of Northumberland. <Q>When he began his journey, (&s;ays an old manu&s;cript life of him) he would have ten pounds in his pur&s;e, and at his coming home he would be twenty nobles in debt, which he would always pay within a fortnight after.</Q> In the gaols he vi&s;ited he was not only careful to give the pri&s;oners proper in&s;tructions, but u&s;ed al&s;o to purcha&s;e for them &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they wanted.</P>
<P>Of his benevolent temper the following in&s;tance is pre&s;erved. One day return|ing home, he &s;aw in a field &s;everal people crowding together, and judging &s;ome|thing more than ordinary had happened, he rode up, and found that one of the hor&s;es in a team had &s;uddenly dropped down, which they were endeavouring to rai&s;e, but in vain, for the hor&s;e was dead. The owner of it &s;eemed much dejected with his misfortune; and declaring how grievous a lo&s;s it would be to him, Mr Gilpin bade him not to be di&s;heartened; "I'll let you have," &s;ays he, <Q>hone&s;t
<PB N="559" REF="590">
man, that hor&s;e of mine,</Q> and pointed to his &s;ervant's. "Ah! ma&s;ter," re|plied the countryman, "my pocket will not reach &s;uch a bea&s;t as that." <Q>Come, come,</Q> &s;aid Mr Gilpin, <Q>take him, take him; and when I demand my money, then thou &s;halt pay me.</Q></P>
<P>Towards the latter part of his life, Mr Gilpin went through his duty with great difficulty. His health was much impaired; for the fatigue he had undergone &s;o many years had broken his con&s;titution. Thus he complains in a letter to his friend: <Q>To &s;u&s;tain all the&s;e travels and troubles I have a very weak body, &s;ubject to many di&s;ea&s;es; by the monitions whereof I am daily warned to remember death. My greate&s;t grief of all is, that my memory is quite decayed: My &s;ight faileth; my hearing faileth; with other ailments, more than I can well expre&s;s.</Q> While he was thus &s;truggling with an advanced age, and much impaired con&s;titu|tion, there happened a very unfortunate affair, which entirely di&s;troyed his health. As he was cro&s;&s;ing the market-place at Durham, an ox ran at him, and pu&s;hed him down with &s;uch violence, that it was imagined the brui&s;es he received would have occa&s;ioned his death. He lay long confined; and though he again got abroad, he never recovered the little &s;trength he had before, and continued lame as long as he lived. But &s;ickne&s;s was not the only di&s;tre&s;s which the declining years of this ex|cellent man had to &s;truggle with. As age and infirmity began to le&s;&s;en the weight and influence he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the malice and oppo&s;ition of his enemies prevailed more: And he experienced much ingratitude and ill u&s;age, at a time when he was already &s;inking under a weight of cares.</P>
<P>His pious re&s;ignation under &s;uch evils was not long exerci&s;ed. About the be|ginning of February, 1583, finding him&s;elf very weak, and &s;en&s;ible his end mu&s;t be drawing near, he told his friends his apprehen&s;ions, and &s;poke of his death with that happy compo&s;ure which attends the conclu&s;ion of a good life. He was &s;oon after confined to his chamber; but his &s;en&s;es continued perfect to the la&s;t. A few days before his death he de&s;ired his friends, acquaintance, and dependents might be called into his chamber; and being rai&s;ed in his bed, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to them in a very pathetic manner, earne&s;tly exhorting them to the practice of piety and virtue. He al&s;o &s;ent far &s;everal per&s;ons who had hitherto made no good u&s;e of his advice, and upon whom he imagined his dying words might have a better effect. But his &s;peech began to &s;aulter before he had fini&s;hed his exhortations. The re|maining hours of his life he &s;pent in prayer, and conver&s;ation with &s;ome &s;elect friends, mentioning often the con&s;olations of Chri&s;tianity; declaring they were the only true ones, and that nothing el&s;e could bring a man peace at the la&s;t. He died on the 4th of March, 1583, in the &s;ixty-&s;ixth year of his age.</P>
<P>He is de&s;cribed to have been tall of &s;tature, &s;lender, and hawk-no&s;ed. In his diet he was temperate, or rather ab&s;temious. His parts were good; his imagination, memory, and judgment lively, retentive, and &s;olid. His acquirements were con|&s;iderable; for by unwearied application he had gained &s;o great a &s;tore of know|ledge, that his biographers have &s;aid he was ignorant of no part of learning at that time in e&s;teem. In languages, hi&s;tory, and divinity, he particularly excelled. He read poetry with a good ta&s;te; and was him&s;elf, according to bi&s;hop Charleton, no
<PB N="560" REF="591">
mean poet. His temper was naturally warm; and in his youth he &s;ometimes gave way to pa&s;&s;ion; but at length he entirely corrected that infirmity. His di&s;po&s;ition was naturally &s;erious; yet among his particular friends he was chearful, and &s;ome|times facetious. His general behaviour was very affable. His &s;everity had no object but him&s;elf; to others he was humble, candid, and indulgent. He had ex|traordinary &s;kill in the art of managing a fortune; looking upon him&s;elf barely as a &s;teward for other people, and ob&s;erving that his own de&s;ires &s;hould not exceed what calm rea&s;on could ju&s;tify. Extravagance was con&s;idered by him as a &s;pecies of inju&s;tice; and amid&s;t his employments he found lei&s;ure to look into his affairs, well knowing that frugality is the &s;upport of charity. His intimacies were but few; for it was his endeavour, as the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity required, to dilate rather than to contract his affections: Yet where he profe&s;&s;ed a particular friend&s;hip, Mr Gilpin was a religious ob&s;erver of its offices: Was the mo&s;t candid interpreter of the words and actions of others. Where he plainly &s;aw failings, would make every po&s;&s;ible allowance for them: U&s;ed to expre&s;s a particular indignation at &s;lander; often &s;aying, it more de&s;erved the gallows than theft: Was remarkably guarded when he &s;poke of others; con&s;idering common fame as the fal&s;e&s;t medium, and a man's reputation as his mo&s;t valuable property: Ever di&s;played the greate&s;t &s;incerity, as well as humility, in his tran&s;actions with others: But the principal virtues, and di&s;tingui&s;hing parts of his character, were his con&s;cientious di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial office, exten&s;ive benevolence, and exalted piety. The con&s;tant tenor of his life was &s;o uniformly agreeable to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of morality and religion, that it gained him among his contemporaries the title of the Northern Apo&s;tle. In his charitable di&s;tributions, he had no mea&s;ure but the bounds of his income, of which the lea&s;t portion was always laid out on him&s;elf: Was the more particularly careful to give away in his life time whatever could be &s;aved for the poor, as he had often &s;een and regretted the abu&s;e of po&s;thumous charities. <Q>It is my de&s;ign, at my departure, (&s;aid he, writing to a friend) to leave no more behind me than what will &s;erve to bury me, and pay my debts.</Q> What little remained he left wholly to the poor, except a few &s;light tokens of remembrance bequeathed to his friends. His uncommon benevolence made him de&s;ervedly &s;tiled the father of the poor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the rebellion of the earl of We&s;tmoreland, Mr Gilpin retired to Oxford, and in his ab&s;ence the rebels who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Durham, &s;cattered them&s;elves as far as Houghton, and &s;eized his barns and cattle, the chief of the plunderers being a per&s;on whom he had &s;aved from the gallows.

The etymo|logy of the name of this place is evident, being compounded of <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>&s;haw,</HI> a woody mount or hill. This eminence is the property of General Lambton, and now bears oak and other timber on its &s;kirts, and contains lime-&s;tone and free-&s;tone quarries, with &s;everal valuable mines of coal. The pro&s;pect from thence is exten|&s;ive and noble, comprehending many of the chief objects in the ea&s;tern part of the county, with a beautiful tract of country towards the &s;outh and we&s;t, in which the city of Durham and Che&s;ter are particularly con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>SOUTH-BIDICK, the &s;eat of Mrs Mary Lambton, lies on the banks of the river Were. By the Boldon Book it &s;eems as if this manor had anciently appertained to the See of Durham; for it is thereby &s;tated, that the villains of South-Bedic held their vill in firm, rendering five pounds rent, and providing eight &s;core men at harve&s;t, and thirty-&s;ix carriages to lead corn at Houghton. But in the &s;econd year of bi&s;hop Bury, by an inqui&s;ition taken on the death of Alianora de Colleye, it appears &s;he died &s;ei&s;ed of the manor of South-Bedyk, juxta Newbotelle, held of the bi&s;hop <HI>in capite,</HI> by homage, fealty, and the quarter part of a knight's &s;ee, with &s;uit at the county; &s;o that it &s;eems from thence the manor had been aliened from the See<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>South-Bedic.</HI></P>

<BIBL><HI>Hatfield's Survey.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. In our attention to the city of Durham certain con|jectures were formed touching the tradition, that Wardon hill was the ground where St Cuthbert's remains were miraculou&s;ly &s;taid on the return from Ripon, previous to the &s;ettlement at Durham; in that place were noted the uncertain evi|dence of ancient writers, and we pre&s;umed to give an opinion, that Wardon was not the place pointed out by the writers of antiquity. Tho&s;e who treat of our church hi&s;tory do not mention that any particular veneration was paid to the &s;aint's re&s;ting place, till the time of prior Hugh of Darlington, who built a camera, a hall, and chapel at Wardelau, or Wadele. Wardon was from very early times part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the See, but never of the convent, &s;o that the prior had no right to enter therein, and build a lodge or hall for the u&s;e of the cloi&s;ter. The hill of Wardon is a con&s;iderable eminence, ri&s;ing gradually from all &s;ides but towards the ea&s;t, where it is more &s;teep: There are no remains of buildings to be di&s;cover|ed on any part of it. The &s;imilitude of name to that of the place mentioned by old writers, has led to the error; but if we con&s;ider the names Wardon and Wardona, we &s;hall be led into two probable conjectures touching their etymology, either that the eminence commanding an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect by &s;ea and land, was the &s;tation of the warden of the north, in &s;ome conflicts with the Danes or Scots, and was called the Warden's Law, or Mount; or that this being a mark and guide for &s;ailors, when the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of the ancients kept clo&s;e under the &s;hores, and for want of the compa&s;s dared not in dark weather to tru&s;t them&s;elves to an open and &s;tormy &s;ea, it was the point of view which &s;truck the eye on pa&s;&s;ing the pro|montory of Flamborough or Souter Point, and guided to the mouth of the river Were, gaining thereby the name of Were-Dun, or the Hill of Were. It is left to the reader to judge of the&s;e conjectures, we having di&s;covered no degree of evi|dence to &s;upport the tradition, that by miraculous interpo&s;ition, here began the leading events which were to aggrandize the pre&s;ent city of Durham.</P>

<P>COKEN, the &s;eat of Ralph Carr, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> lies in this pari&s;h, on the banks of the river Were, where the river forms a beautiful curvature, almo&s;t to enclo&s;e the en|chanting &s;cene. The man&s;ion-hou&s;e is ancient, but the &s;ituation elevated and fine. Mr Pennant, from &s;ome inadvertency, &s;peaks of it as being the &s;eat of St Godric's au&s;terities; Finchale, where the hermitage &s;tood, being on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. We repeat part of the de&s;cription given by that judicious traveller. <Q>12 July, &s;aw Coken, the &s;eat of Mr Carr; a mo&s;t romantic &s;ituation, laid out with great judgment: The walks are very exten&s;ive, principally along the &s;ides or at the bottom of great dells, bounded with va&s;t precipices, finely wooded; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines and other fruit trees, which I was told bore well, but late. The river Were winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches, at the place where you enter the&s;e walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a &s;olid rock. The view towards the ruins of Finchal abbey is remarkably great; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent &s;olemnity, a &s;it retreat for its mona&s;tic inhabitants. This was once called the De&s;ert, and was the rude &s;cene of the au&s;terities of St Godric, who carried them to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s extravagance. A &s;ober mind may even at pre&s;ent be affected with horror at the pro&s;pect from the &s;ummits of the cliffs into a dark&s;ome and &s;tupendous cha&s;m, rendered &s;till more tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its di&s;tant bottom.</Q> The hou&s;e and adjacent grounds are &s;ituated on an eminence, on three &s;ides wa&s;hed by the river, and towards the ea&s;t bounded by deep dells, filled with &s;tately fore&s;t trees. The &s;outhern &s;ide of this penin&s;ula is laid out in plea&s;ure grounds; one wide and extended terrace runs along the &s;ummit of the cliffs, another at their feet: From the upper terrace fine openings in the wood afford pro&s;pects of the adjacent lands; and in one point of view, you look down upon the &s;olemn vale &s;cattered with the ruins of the mona|&s;tery
<PB N="572" REF="603">
and abbey. The lower terrace is formed on the &s;helves of the rocky &s;hore, from whence the cliffs ri&s;e perpendicular near an hundred feet, crowned with hanging oaks, which &s;trike their roots into the fi&s;&s;ures of the rock, and &s;tretch a &s;olemn umbrage over the walk. From this terrace the ruins of the religious edifice appear in all their maje&s;tic beauties, &s;hut in by ri&s;ing grounds fringed with woods; the river falls over a rocky channel in troubled &s;treams, and the murmurs of the waters are repeated by a &s;oothing echo. For religious contemplation, reclu&s;e piety, and &s;elf-denial, never was place better adapted; much pity it was ever di&s;|graced by unmeaning &s;everity and hypocri&s;y! Various are the beautiful &s;cenes this walk affords; de&s;cription is languid; to vi&s;it the place is the only means of forming ideas of its picture&s;que excellencies. Proceeding along the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the eminence, the walk is carried on the &s;ummit of a deep and wooded dell, which relieves the eye for &s;ome time before you enter upon the northern rocks, which are &s;haken, rugged, and truly augu&s;t; mighty volumes hang over your head, as if the wind which &s;hook the oaks would rend the precipice and tumble it into the vale. Several deep grottos formed by nature, are &s;hadowed with trees &s;u&s;pended from their roof; ha&s;ty &s;treams fall from the cliffs, and with a hollow clamour increa&s;e the plea&s;ing &s;olemnity of the va&s;t &s;cene. The river forms a canal near a mile in length, through an avenue of rocks and hanging fore&s;ts; the &s;pire of Che&s;ter church the terminating object. The woods are noble, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of oaks of a great age: Nature has lavi&s;hed beauties on this place, and what art has done with an excellent ta&s;te, has &s;moothed her brow where art was wanted, and opened to the eye tho&s;e beauties her wildne&s;s would otherwi&s;e have concealed. In the time of bi&s;hop Galfrid, one Aellafus, a prie&s;t, gave Coken to the church of Dur|ham. This is to be under&s;tood only of part of the territory now called Coken. The fir&s;t lay per&s;on we find in the ancient records po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lands in Coken, is Alexander de Kibble&s;worth, of whom the family of Birtley, in bi&s;hop Hatfield's time, held lands there; they al&s;o held other lands in Coken of the priory of Dur|ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

The Lumleys had lands there in bi&s;hop Langley's time.</P>
<P>OFFERTON was one of the places given by Athel&s;tan to the See of Durham, as an appendage of Weremouth. In bi&s;hop Beaumont's time the vill of Offerton was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of John de Denum<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

There were thirty-one villains, who held their lands, and performed their &s;ervices like tho&s;e of Boldon. By that record it appears there were only two free tenants, Simon and Galfrid Coke&s;maht, who held each half a carucate of land, and &s;erved on the bi&s;h|op's emba&s;&s;ies. The carpenter, &s;mith, and punder each held lands for their &s;ervices, and the two vills rendered 30s. cornage, and provided two milch cows. The
<PB N="576" REF="609">
deme&s;ne was let out, but the pa&s;ture and &s;heep &s;tock were in the hands of the bi&s;hop. In bi&s;hop Bury's time we find one John Fairey was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a me&s;&s;uage and a parcel of land in Ea&s;ington, held of the bi&s;hop <HI>in capite,</HI> by the &s;ingular &s;er|vice of <Q>aiding the bi&s;hop's bailiff to drive goods di&s;trained, atte&s;ting &s;ummon&s;es, and &s;uperintending the carriage of a dole of wine annually.</Q> This family held their &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;ome ages. In Hatfield's Survey the free tenants are named, and all performed the &s;ervice of emba&s;&s;y. The deme&s;ne lands are therein &s;tated to be upwards of 300 acres. It appears there were only twenty-nine bond tenants, who occupied thirty-two me&s;&s;uages, each holding two oxgangs of land, computing fifteen acres to an oxgang, and paying for work xi s. ix d. for aid, &s;cat, or &s;cac. pennys, and plow-pennys, at the fea&s;t of the Virgin 19d. for &s;cot|pennys, called by the tenants in that di&s;trict malt-pennys 15 d. and for aver or plow-pennys at the two fea&s;ts of St Cuthbert, the fea&s;t of the Nativity, and John the Bapti&s;t 12d. for woodloads 8d. and at the fea&s;t of the Purification &s;ix bu&s;hels of lot oats, at the fea&s;t of the Nativity two hens, at the Pa&s;&s;over ten eggs; and in lieu of other work 13 d. They al&s;o paid 30s. cornage, 40s. for ca&s;tlemen, 12s. in lieu of one milch cow, and carried a ton of wine. In the &s;ervice of the cottagers was that of collecting the hens, and carrying them to the bi&s;hop's manors. The parcels of freehold in Thorp and Ea&s;ington being very &s;mall, it would not be a profitable labour to trace a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, we find among them the Guys, Daltons, and Claxtons.</P>
<P>The town of Ea&s;ington &s;tands on an elevated &s;ituation, the land gradually in|clining towards the &s;ea. At the upper end of the town, on an eminence, is the church, a lofty building; a &s;ea mark for mariners. The chancel of this church is twelve paces long and &s;ix wide, with three &s;teps a&s;cending to the table; is ceiled, &s;tuccoed, and neatly wain&s;cotted, with &s;ome tabernacle work above the table. The ea&s;t window is formed of three lights, under a pointed arch, with ro&s;e work tracery; and there are three windows to the &s;outh, of two lights each, under point|ed arches. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch, ri&s;ing from corbles, and clo&s;ed with a neat &s;creen, ornamented with foliage and open work in oak. You de&s;cend by four &s;teps into the nave, the length of which is eighteen

The pulpit is &s;upported by the fir&s;t &s;outh pillar. The belfry ri&s;es on a circular arch, and the tower is about &s;ixty feet in height. The nave is lighted by three windows in the &s;outh aile, and four upper windows on each &s;ide of the center aile; and is &s;talled with oak, orna|mented with fleur-de-lis.

<BIBL><HI>Records at Durham.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> The town of Hawthorn is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a dry hill, within half a mile of the &s;ea: The &s;hore is rocky, and broken into a multitude of deep caverns: The offing is full of rocks and &s;hoals, &s;o that in &s;tormy weather it is tremendous to mariners, whil&s;t the heavy breaker &s;hakes the &s;ounding coa&s;t. In the mouth of a deep and narrow creek, where the rocks are the mo&s;t broken, rugged, and romantic, admiral Mil|banke built a &s;ummer retreat, which he called Sailor's Hall; at high tide it almo&s;t hangs over the waves, and looks upon the mo&s;t &s;tormy and &s;haken part of the &s;hore. The placidne&s;s of a &s;ummer evening's calm, when the moon is reflected on the &s;mooth bo&s;om of the ocean, is highly plea&s;ing to the contemplative eye; but when the &s;torm lifts the di&s;tracted waves, with a horrid gloom confounds the ele|ments, and mixes the &s;pray even with the clouds; when the winds groan in the caverns, and the hoar&s;e billows thunder along the beach; when the &s;hrill cries of di&s;tre&s;s and wreck &s;trike the ear from wretches without &s;uccour; when the af|frighted cattle bellowing leave the hills, and driving &s;howers &s;weep the di&s;con&s;olate land&s;cape, little remains to make &s;uch a &s;ituation eligible. On the &s;outh &s;ide of Hawthorn-dean is an eminence called the Beacon Hill, where fires were formerly rai&s;ed, to keep mariners at a di&s;tance from this dangerous coa&s;t.</P>

width: On the north &s;ide are two arches, now built up, which &s;hew it formerly was of greater extent. The ea&s;t end is lighted by three long narrow windows; but to the &s;outh is a large window, ornamented with tracery. The chancel is &s;eparated from the nave by a heavy round arch without ornament. The body or nave of the church has two &s;ide ailes, and is in length about eighteen paces, the ailes being little more than three paces wide: The &s;outh aile has undergone much alteration; the pillars have been re&s;tored in modern times, and &s;upport five pointed arches: Three windows, of two lights each, under pointed arches, give light to this &s;ide. The north aile is al&s;o formed by a row of four pillars; that to the ea&s;t is flat, &s;upporting a pointed arch; the other three are of the old Saxon architecture, &s;hort, with plain capitals, the &s;hafts fluted and otherwi&s;e ornamented: They &s;up|port four circular arches, ornamented with the zig-zag mouldings, and &s;eem to be of nearly the &s;ame date as the nave of Durham cathedral: This aile is lighted with two windows under pointed arches. The tower is low, and &s;upported by but|tre&s;&s;es, forming an oblong &s;quare of five paces ea&s;t and we&s;t, and &s;even paces north and &s;outh.

<P>Among the pious works of the opulent prelate Hugh de Puteaco, or Pud&s;ey, there is none &s;urviving to this age of &s;uch importance as the foundation of Sherburn ho&s;pital, de&s;igned for the reception of &s;ixty-five poor lepers, with a ma&s;ter and other officers to &s;uperintend the &s;ame, which great and godly work he effected about the year 1181, when that dreadful malady prevailed grievou&s;ly in this land. He dedicated the hou&s;e to Chri&s;t, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, Lazarus, and his &s;i&s;ters Mary and Martha <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Shyrburne&mdash;Clarus &s;ons Lat. Lel.&mdash;Scyreburna, Saxon.&mdash;Here is an ho&s;pital of poore men, which Hugh Puteac, the joly by&s;hop of Durham, builded in the reigne of K. Hen. II.&mdash;<HI>Lambarde's Topog. Dict. p.</HI> 326.</P>
<P>Our Saxon ance&s;tors dedicated many buildings to what they e&s;teemed pious, and very few to charitable u&s;es &s;olely. Bi&s;hop Tanner has not noticed &s;o many as &s;ix e&s;tabli&s;hed by them; but we ought not to con|clude, from this omi&s;&s;ion, that they were regardle&s;s of their fellow creatures labouring under the various calamities incident to human nature, who were unable to help them&s;elves. In general, the poor were &s;up|ported by the religious &s;ocieties, and the members of each were enjoined by the rules of their re&s;pective orders, and the expre&s;s directions of their founders and benefactors, to relieve the wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es not only of the nece&s;&s;itous and infirm in their neighbourhood, but of travelling people al&s;o. From neglect or the nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s and infection of di&s;ea&s;es, the wretchedne&s;s of the poor would perhaps not be &s;ufficiently relieved, which induced the benevolent to found ho&s;pitals for the more immediate and greater relief of di&s;|tempered objects. Within 100 years after the Conque&s;t, 59 ho&s;pitals were erected in this kingdom; and before the end of the reign of Henry III. they were increa&s;ed to 131.</P>
<P>The lepro&s;y was a di&s;order very prevalent in Europe during the tenth and eleventh centuries; and its &s;preading was doubtle&s;s the cau&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing many ho&s;pitals. Some per&s;ons have conjectured that in Chri&s;tendom they amounted to 15000 in number; but without a&s;&s;enting to &s;o vague a calculation, it is cer|tain, that in England there was hardly a large city, or a capital town, near which there was not one at lea&s;t of the&s;e lazar-hou&s;es erected: We indeed find none within the walls, for as the di&s;temper was &s;o violent as to be judged infectious, the afflicted per&s;ons were denied all public commerce.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitals were originally de&s;igned for the relief and entertainment of travellers upon the road, and parti|cularly of pilgrims, and therefore were generally built by the way-&s;ide.&mdash;<HI>Burn's Eccl. Law, vol. ii. p.</HI> 455.</P>
<P>From the &s;ituation of Sherburn Ho&s;pital we may conjecture, that it was partly intended for this benevo|lent purpo&s;e, as well as for the reception of lepers.</P>
<P>The lepro&s;y was much more common in this part of the globe formerly than at pre&s;ent, and perhaps near half the ho&s;pitals that were in England were for lepers. At the five gates of Norwich were five hou&s;es of this &s;ort; and lepers were &s;o numerous in the twelfth century, that by a decree in the Lateran Council un|der pope Alexander III. 1179, they were empowered to erect churches for them&s;elves, and to have their own mini&s;ters (lepers, we may &s;uppo&s;e) to officiate in them. This &s;hews at once how infectious and offen&s;ive their di&s;temper was; and on this account, in England, <Q>where a man was a leper, and dwelling in a town, and would come into the church or among his, neighbours, where they were a&s;&s;embled, to talk with them to their annoyance or di&s;turbance, a writ lay&punc; <HI>de lepro&s;o amovendo.</HI></Q>&mdash;<HI>Fitzh. Nat. Brev. p.</HI> 520, 521.</P>
<P>What follows is remarkable. The writ is for tho&s;e lepers who appear to the &s;ight of all men that they are lepers, by their voice and their &s;ores the putrefaction of their fle&s;h, and by the &s;mell of them. And &s;o late as the reign of Edw. VI. multitudes of lepers &s;eem to have been in England; for in 1 Edw. VI. c. 3, in which directions are given for carrying the poor to the places where they were born, &amp;c. we read the follow|ing clau&s;e: <Q>Provided always that all leprous and poor bedrid creatures may; at their liberty, remain and continue in &s;uch hou&s;es appointed for lepers or bedrid people as they now be in.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Burn's Hi&s;t. Poor Laws, p.</HI> 68.</P>
<P>In the reign of Hen. I. the lepro&s;y (by &s;ome called <HI>Elephantia&s;is</HI>) ran by infection all over England, and it is believed that the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t came into this i&s;land out of Egypt, which more than once had &s;pread it&s;elf into Europe, fir&s;t in the days of Pompey the Great, afterwards under Heraclius, and at other times, as may be &s;een in hi&s;tory, but never (&s;o far as I have read) did it before that time appear in England.&mdash;<HI>Camd.

He was a gentleman of &s;o fine accompli&s;hments that king James I. made choice of him as preceptor. He died on the 9th of April, 1623, being then newly cut for the &s;tone, and was buried in the chapel of Eton college.</P>
<P>William Shawe, A. M. was collated to this ho&s;pital the 11th of July, 1623, by bi&s;hop Neile, on the death of Thomas Murray. He had &s;even acres of land allotted to him in right of the ho&s;pital, upon a divi&s;ion of the townfields of Sherburn. Died before September 1636.</P>

After the re&s;toration of king Charles he petitioned the king to be re&s;tored, and enjoyed it till his death in December 1679: Was buried in the ho&s;pital chapel without any memorial.</P>

His benevolence was diffu&s;ive and general; while ma&s;ter of this ho&s;pital he did not confine the old men as heretofore to the &s;trict allowance, which good as it might have been when anciently &s;ettled on them by their founder, was now become a &s;ad and &s;canty pittance, but as far as it was in his power, made them enjoy the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the benefaction. He demoli&s;hed all the little wretched huts in which they were huddled together, and erected a hand&s;ome commodious &s;tone edifice, making it to con&s;i&s;t of twenty different apartments, that each might have one en|tirely to him&s;elf; and al&s;o con&s;tructed a large room in the centre of the building for their common reception, and comfortably provided it with every nece&s;&s;ary accommodation: For this purpo&s;e he cut down and &s;old a large wood at Ebche&s;ter belonging the ho&s;pital, as it is &s;aid, adequate to the expence.

In&s;talled dean of Durham in June 1774, having before re&s;igned the ho&s;pital to his &s;on the pre&s;ent dean of Roche&s;ter. He died the 2d of Augu&s;t, 1777.</P>

<PB N="590" REF="623"></NOTE>. The ho&s;pital &s;tands at the foot and we&s;t &s;ide of a large &s;quare area or green, containing near an acre, and con&s;i&s;ts of a neat but low building, having a hall in the center, and two wings formed into lodgings: On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the area, which is a hanging plain gradually de&s;cending to the we&s;t, is the ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and a dwelling for the chief farmer: On the north &s;ide is a porter's lodge and gateway, in the center of the boundary wall; and on the &s;outh &s;ide, at the ea&s;t corner, &s;tands the chapel, which adjoins to the garden. You enter the chapel through the tower; the nave is now totally di&s;u&s;ed, the chancel only receiving the congregation; the nave is light|ed by three narrow windows to the &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, under circular arches, and ornamented with &s;mall round pila&s;ters, belted and capitalled like tho&s;e in the ea&s;t part of Dur|ham cathedral, and apparently of equal date. The pulpit and de&s;k are placed on each hand of the entrance into the chancel, which is much more modern than the nave; it is lighted by three windows on the north and &s;outh &s;ides, all under point|ed
<PB N="591" REF="624">
arches: In the center &s;outh window are the arms of the Montagues in painted gla&s;s. The ea&s;t window is new, con&s;i&s;ting of five lights and &s;ome elegant tracery, with painted gla&s;s: In the ro&s;es of the upper tracery are the arms of Neville. In the center light is the figure repre&s;ented on the ho&s;pital &s;eal, above which are the arms of lord Crew, and tho&s;e of the See. The chancel is neatly &s;talled on each &s;ide for the brethren. Within the altar rails towards the &s;outh wall is the tomb of Thomas Lever, who died in 1577. The &s;ituation of this ho&s;pital is remarkably healthful, it is &s;urrounded with dry and fertile lands, and &s;tands about two miles di&s;tant from Durham.</P>

<P>By the&s;e con&s;titutions it appears that the chapel fir&s;t erected was dedicated to God, Mary Magdalen, and St Nicholas, and was &s;erved by three prie&s;ts and four clerks, part to officiate at the altar of Mary Magdalen; and as the ho&s;pital was to receive both &s;exes, other part to officiate at the altar of St Nicholas, where the women were to hear ma&s;s, the chapel being &s;ituated at the &s;outh door of their hou&s;e; &s;o that it &s;eems the men and women had hou&s;es at &s;eparate &s;ides of the area. Bi&s;hop Kellaw, for greater decorum, built a new chapel on the north &s;ide of the great chapel, which he dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and where he ordered ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to
<PB N="606" REF="639">
be celebrated daily to the brethren, and to this &s;ervice he appointed a fourth prie&s;t. On dominical days and great &s;olemnities, he ordered &s;ervice to be performed by all the prie&s;ts to both men and women; the men being preceded by their prior, and the women by their priore&s;s. The procurator or ma&s;ter was not confined to be in clerical orders; but was re&s;trained to that moderation that he &s;hould not keep more than three hor&s;es without &s;ome urgent nece&s;&s;ity. The prie&s;ts and clerks were to lie in the chamber next the chapel, unle&s;s the ma&s;ter required one to lodge in his chamber: And the ma&s;ter and all others were to dine and &s;up in the hall. Bi&s;hop Kellaw appointed the times of &s;ervice, and the burning of lights before the altar. The number of lepers to be entertained being &s;ixty-five, the me&s;s was directed, each to have a loaf and a gallon of beer daily; three days in the week fle&s;h meat, and four days fi&s;h, &s;o that one di&s;h of meat, fi&s;h, chee&s;e or butter, &s;hould &s;erve two: But on great days two di&s;hes were to be provided, par|ticularly on quadrage&s;ima day they were to have fre&s;h &s;almon or other fi&s;h, if they could be had, for one di&s;h; and on Michaelmas-day they &s;hould have gee&s;e, a goo&s;e to every four; but if that fe&s;tival happened on a weekly fa&s;t day, the goo&s;e fea&s;t was to be po&s;tponed to Sunday. They were allowed yearly three yards of woollen cloth, ru&s;&s;ett or white, &s;ix yards of linen, and &s;ix yards of canvas, with other ne|ce&s;&s;aries, as tru&s;&s;es of &s;traw and bundles of reeds, with four yole clogs for the vigils of our Saviour. The brethren were to chu&s;e their prior, and the &s;i&s;ters their priore&s;s. They were allowed fires from Michaelmas-day to the day of All-Saints; the mea&s;ure of the peats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuel cut from the mo&s;&s;es of moor lands.</NOTE> being fixed. Certain rules were ordained for the &s;ick, for funerals, and prayers. From Penteco&s;t to Michaelmas red herrings and &s;alted viands were prohibited. Two wa&s;hers were appointed, and an allow|ance for the nur&s;es who attended the &s;ick; and each member was allowed in money at two days in the year five-pence, and once in the year five &s;hillings.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed the ho&s;pital continued to be regulated and governed by the fore|going rules till the time of bi&s;hop Langley, when great abu&s;es were complained of, the pious in&s;titution being converted into private emolument, and the buildings &s;uffered to go to ruin, that prelate i&s;&s;ued his commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Commi&s;&s;ion to enquire into dilapidations of Sherburn ho&s;pital, by Thomas Langley bi&s;hop of Durham, 4th of September, 1429.</NOTE>, dated the 4th of Sep|tember, 1429, directed to William Chaunceller, his temporal chancellor, and others, to vi&s;it and examine the dilapidations in the ho&s;pital erections, and to en|quire of the abu&s;es of the charity. Upon the commi&s;&s;ioners reporting the mi&s;er|able condition and poverty thereof, the bi&s;hop thought proper to apply to pope Eugene IV. in&s;tead of the king, for redre&s;s, who readily granted a faculty or com|mi&s;&s;ion to the bi&s;hop, to make new rules and ordinances for the better government thereof, which he accordingly made on the 22d day of July, 1434, and thereby appointed, that the future ma&s;ter &s;hould be in clerical orders, and that he &s;hould keep four chaplains, four clerks, or &s;inging men, and two boys, chaunters; and ordained certain rules for the celebration of divine &s;ervice, and for the conduct of the prie&s;ts, clerks and boys<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nova ordinatio &s;ive reformatio ho&s;pitalis de Shirburn, per Thomam Langley epi&s;copum, ex commi&s;|&s;ione Eugenii papae quarti, 22 Julii, 1434.</NOTE>.

It thereby appears, that the lepro&s;y (for the relief of tho&s;e under which affliction this ho&s;pital was founded) was at that time almo&s;t eradicated, for he directs, that in remembrance of the original foundation, two lepers &s;hould be re|ceived into the ho&s;pital, if they could be found, but to be kept apart from the re&s;t of the people admitted to the hou&s;e: To tho&s;e, thirteen poor people were to be ad|ded, to be provided with meat and drink of ten-pence value every week, or ten|pence of ready money at their own option, and have yearly the &s;um of 6s. 8d. for fuel and cloaths, and to me&s;s and lodge in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and daily to attend ma&s;s. Upon the death of a brother, another poor man to be cho&s;en by the ma&s;ter within fifteen days, under the penalty of paying a mark to the fabric of the church at Durham. An old woman of good character was to be provided at the ma&s;ter's expence, to attend the brethren, wa&s;h their linen, and do other offices. The ma&s;ter to have the care of all the goods and buildings of the ho&s;pital, and to take an oath for the due performance of all things &s;tipulated by tho&s;e ordinances.</P>
<P>We hear of no further abu&s;es of the charity till the time of bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, when Anthony Salvin, then ma&s;ter, in 1557, pre&s;ented a petition to that prelate, praying that a commi&s;&s;ion of enquiry might i&s;&s;ue, with interrogatories <HI>ad perpetuam rei memoriam,</HI> which commi&s;&s;ion was accordingly i&s;&s;ued, and depo&s;itions were taken thereon the 27th of April, 1557, and duly returned.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ORDINANCES AND RULES,</HI> For the good order and government of <HI>Sherborn Ho&s;pital,</HI> in the County of Durham.</HEAD>
<P>Ordinances and rules for the good order and government of the ma&s;ter and brethren of Chri&s;t's ho&s;pital at Sherborne, near Durham, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, delivered to them the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, by Edward, by divine providence lord bi&s;hop of Durham, at his primary vi&s;itation of the &s;aid ho&s;|pital, which was begun Augu&s;t the 14th, 1735, and continued by &s;everal ad|journments to that day.</P>
<P>EDWARD, by divine providence lord bi&s;hop of Dure&s;me. To our well be|loved in Chri&s;t, Wadham Chandler, clerk, ma&s;ter of arts, ma&s;ter of the &s;aid ho&s;|pital, Richard Grey, John Whitfield, and the re&s;t of the brethren.</P>
<P>If the changes incident to all per&s;ons and things did not in&s;en&s;ibly introduce deviations from the original con&s;titutions of &s;ocieties al&s;o, and make frequent re|views of the laws whereby they &s;hould be governed nece&s;&s;ary, for pre&s;erving a con&s;i&s;tency between men's practices and their rules, yet the pre&s;ent condition of Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital at Sherburn in particular, would demand a &s;peedy provi&s;ion to be made again&s;t &s;ome evils the hou&s;e labours under, and which by longer neglect may grow to be very detrimental to it.</P>
<P>For having in our vi&s;itation upon the place di&s;covered that all the local &s;tatutes made by our predece&s;&s;ors, &s;ince the foundation of the &s;aid ho&s;pital by queen Eliza|beth, with con&s;ent of her parliament, were either lo&s;t, concealed, or of no validity, for want of a ratification under the epi&s;copal &s;eal, as is required by her act; that their &s;tocks of cattle and corn were de&s;troyed and con&s;umed in the time of the civil wars, by the two armies in the neighbourhood of Sherburn hou&s;e; that no inven|tory hath been &s;ince taken of their goods, nor bond given by the entering ma&s;ter, for any &s;um of money to be paid to every &s;ucceeding ma&s;ter, as a fund in readi|ne&s;s for the occa&s;ions of the &s;aid ho&s;pital, and as was wont formerly to be given, we judged no time was to be lo&s;t in &s;ettling new rules, without which no &s;ociety can well &s;ub&s;i&s;t, which may al&s;o be effectual for &s;ecuring what goods and chattles
<PB N="612" REF="645">
are &s;till remaining, and prevent further ruin to their common e&s;tate, which in a long chancery &s;uit at this di&s;tance of time, after a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of two or three ma&s;ters, under a defect of full proofs, mu&s;t be hazarded with &s;mall pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In drawing up the&s;e rules, we have revived as many ordinances of the fir&s;t founders as could be adapted to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and followed tho&s;e of our late predece&s;&s;ors where we could pre&s;ume of their intentions by their articles of vi&s;itation which we have &s;een, and the&s;e rules &s;o collected and hereafter follow|ing, we, by the authority given us by act of parliament, as well as the antienter con&s;titutions of the fir&s;t founders, bi&s;hops of this dioce&s;e, do for our&s;elves and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, order and appoint to be the &s;tanding rules to be ob&s;erved by all the mem|bers of the &s;aid ho&s;pital, until &s;uch time as any of our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e, or in their wi&s;dom think proper to alter or amend them.</P>
<P>And to prevent confu&s;ion by a di&s;agreement of the&s;e with any former rules, (&s;hould any &s;uch come to light hereafter) we, after the example of our worthy predece&s;&s;or Thomas Langley in his new ordination of the &s;aid ho&s;pital, re&s;cind and annul all former con&s;titutions, rules, and ordinances, made by any of our prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and do &s;ub&s;titute the&s;e in their place, as the only rules they &s;hall be bound to obey. Given at our ca&s;tle at Durham, the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, being one of the days and places to which we adjourned our vi&s;itation of the &s;aid ho&s;pital, in the eighteenth year of our con&s;ecration, fifth of our tran&s;lation, and in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-five.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the MASTER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The ma&s;ter &s;hall be always a per&s;on in holy orders, of the degree of ma&s;ter of arts at lea&s;t, a licen&s;ed preacher, and one who is capable of bu&s;ine&s;s and applies him&s;elf to it, e&s;pecially for the maintenance and pro&s;perous e&s;tate of the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ma&s;ter or his deputy appointed by him to act in his name, &s;hall u&s;ually re&s;ide within the &s;aid ho&s;pital, for the better ordering and governing the members thereof, according to an ancient con&s;titution of Tho.

<P N="3">3. The ma&s;ter if he be not con&s;tantly re&s;ident in per&s;on, &s;hall often repair thither to preach and read lectures on catechetical heads to them, and to enquire and hear the complaints of the brethren when they have any, and &s;ee them redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. The common &s;eal &s;hall be kept by the ma&s;ter only, in a box locked up, and not to be tru&s;ted with the deputy, and the ma&s;ter &s;hall be always pre&s;ent when the &s;eal is put to any in&s;trument.</P>
<P N="5">5. The counterparts of the lea&s;es &s;hall be pre&s;erved in the cu&s;tody of the ma&s;ter him&s;elf, and as often as there &s;hall be occa&s;ion to tru&s;t any writing out of his hands, he &s;hall take a note for the &s;afe delivery of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. No demi&s;e of lands anciently u&s;ed to be demi&s;ed, &s;hall pa&s;s otherwi&s;e than by the common &s;eal; and no demi&s;e of lands not demi&s;eable by queen Elizabeth's foundation, &s;hall be accounted valid in law, though it be duly &s;ealed with the com|mon &s;eal.</P>

<P N="10">10. For the better &s;ecuring of this two hundred pounds, or &s;tock or &s;tores to the value thereof, every ma&s;ter &s;oon after his induction, &s;hall be bound to the bi&s;hop of Dure&s;me in the penalty of four hundred pounds, for the payment of two hundred pounds, or &s;tock and &s;tores of that value to his lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or, which bond &s;hall be lodged in the regi&s;try of the bi&s;hop's con&s;i&s;tory court, to be delivered up and cancelled upon performance of the condition by the preceding ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="11">11. An exact inventory &s;hall be taken by every ma&s;ter at his coming into his place of all the plate, hou&s;hold goods, kitchen and brewing ve&s;&s;els, uten&s;ils in the dairy, cellar, and for hu&s;bandry, linen, bedding, and all other furniture, as well belonging to the hou&s;e of the ma&s;ter, as the hou&s;es of the brethren, and three copies made thereof and &s;igned by the &s;aid ma&s;ter, the one to be lodged in the re|gi&s;try afore&s;aid, with the bond for two hundred pounds, the other to be pre&s;erved by the ma&s;ter him&s;elf, and the third to be kept by the heirs or executors of the preceding ma&s;ter, who is obliged to leave the &s;ame as he received them at his en|trance, according to the &s;aid inventory.</P>

<P N="13">13. A quarto book &s;hall be carefully kept by the ma&s;ter or his deputy, wherein &s;hall be fairly entered the names of all the pre&s;ent members, and the time of their coming in, and when and before whom they were &s;worn; and as often as any of them die, the brother who &s;ucceeds him &s;hall have his name entered, his country, pari&s;h, his age, and the day of the year of his being &s;worn, and by whom, and whom he &s;ucceeds, and till this be done, no per&s;on &s;hall be reckoned a brother or member of Sherburn-hou&s;e.</P>
