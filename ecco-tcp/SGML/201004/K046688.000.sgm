<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Synop&s;is was originally in|tended for private amu&s;ement, and as an Index, for the more ready turning to any particular animal in the voluminous hi&s;tory of quadrupeds by M. DE BUFFON: But as it &s;welled by degrees to a &s;ize beyond my fir&s;t expectation, in the end I was determined to fling it into its pre&s;ent form, and to u&s;her it into the world.</P>
<P>THE Synop&s;is of our illu&s;trious countryman Mr. RAY has been long out of print; and though from his enlarged knowlege and great indu&s;try one might well &s;uppo&s;e his Work would for &s;ome time di&s;courage all further attempts of the &s;ame &s;ort, yet a republica|tion of that Synop&s;is would not have an&s;wered our pre&s;ent de&s;ign: For, living at a period when the &s;tudy of Natural Hi&s;tory was but beginning to dawn in the&s;e Kingdoms, and when our contracted. Com|merce deprived him of many lights we now enjoy, he was obliged to content him&s;elf with giving de&s;crip|tions of the few Animals brought over here, and col|lecting the re&s;t of his materials from other Writers. Yet &s;o correct was his genius, that we view a &s;y&s;tematic arrangement ari&s;e even from the Chaos of <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ner.</HI> Under his hand the indige&s;ted matter of the&s;e able and copious Writers a&s;&s;umes a new form, and the whole is made clear and per&s;picuous.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">FROM this period every Writer on the&s;e &s;ubjects propo&s;ed his own method as an example; &s;ome openly, but others more covertly, aiming at the honor of originality, and attempting to &s;eek for fame in the path chalked out by Mr. RAY; but too often without acknowleging the merit of the Guide.</P>
<P>MR. KLEIN, in 1751, made his appearance as a Sy&s;tematic Writer on Quadrupeds, and in his fir&s;t order follows the general arrangement of Mr. RAY; but the change he has made of &s;eparating certain animals, which the la&s;t had con&s;olidated, are exe|cuted with great judgement. He &s;eems le&s;s fortu|nate in his &s;econd order; for, by a &s;ervile regard to a method taken from the number of toes, he has jumbled together mo&s;t oppo&s;ite animals; the <HI>Camel</HI> and the <HI>Sloth,</HI> the <HI>Mole</HI> and the <HI>Bat,</HI> the <HI>Glutton</HI> and <HI>Apes;</HI> happy only in throwing back the <HI>Walrus,</HI> the <HI>Seal,</HI> and the <HI>Manati,</HI> to the extremity of his &s;y&s;tem: I &s;uppo&s;e, as animals nearly bordering on another cla&s;s.</P>
<P>M. BRISSON, in 1756, favored the world with another &s;y&s;tem, arranging his animals by the num|ber or defect of their teeth; beginning with tho&s;e that were toothle&s;s, &s;uch as the <HI>Ant-eater,</HI> and end|ing with tho&s;e that had the greate&s;t number, &s;uch as the <HI>Opo&s;&s;um.</HI> By this method, laudable as it is in many re&s;pects, it mu&s;t happen unavoidably that &s;ome Quadrupeds, very di&s;tant from each other in their manners, are too clo&s;ely connected in his Sy&s;tem; a defect, which, however common, &s;hould be carefully avoided by every Naturali&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">IN point of time, LINNAEUS ought to have the precedence; for he publi&s;hed his fir&s;t Sy&s;tem in 1735. This was followed by &s;everal others, vary|ing con&s;tantly in the arrangement of the animal kingdom, even to the la&s;t edition of 1766. It is therefore difficult to defend, and &s;till more ungrate|full to drop any reflections on a Naturali&s;t, to whom we are &s;o greatly indebted. The variations in his different Sy&s;tems may have ari&s;en from the new and continual di&s;coveries that are made in the animal kingdom; from his &s;incere intention of giving his Sy&s;tems additional improvements, and perhaps from a failing, (unknown indeed to many of his accu&s;ers) a diffidence in the abilities he had exerted in his prior performances. But it mu&s;t be allowed, that the Naturali&s;t runs too great a hazard in imitating his <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> gui&s;e; for in another year he may put on a new form, and leave the complying Philo&s;opher amazed at the metamorpho&s;is.</P>
<P>BUT this is not my only rea&s;on for rejecting the &s;y&s;tem of this otherwi&s;e able Naturali&s;t: There are faults in his arrangement of <HI>Mammalia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or animals which have paps and &s;uckle their young; in which cla&s;s are comprehended not only all the genuine quadrupeds, but even the cetaceous tribe.</NOTE>, that oblige me to &s;eparate my&s;elf, in this one in&s;tance, from his crowd of votaries; but that my &s;ece&s;&s;ion may not appear the effect of whim or envy, it is to be hoped that the following objections will have their weight.</P>
<P>I reject his fir&s;t divi&s;ion, which he calls <HI>Primates,</HI> or Chiefs of the Creation; becau&s;e my vanity will not &s;uffer me to rank mankind with <HI>Apes, Monkies,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Maucaucos</HI> and <HI>Bats,</HI> the companions LINNAEUS has allotted us even in this his la&s;t Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd order of <HI>Bruta</HI> I avoid for much the &s;ame rea&s;on: The mo&s;t intelligent of Quadrupeds, the half-rea&s;oning <HI>Elephant</HI> is made to a&s;&s;ociate with the mo&s;t di&s;cordant and &s;tupid of the creation, with <HI>Sloths, Ant-eaters</HI> and <HI>Armadillos,</HI> or with <HI>Manaties</HI> and <HI>Walru&s;es,</HI> inhabitants of another element.</P>
<P>THE third order of <HI>Ferae</HI> is not more admi&s;&s;ible in all its articles; for it will be impo&s;&s;ible to allow the <HI>Mole,</HI> the <HI>Shrew,</HI> and the harmle&s;s <HI>Hedge-hog,</HI> to be the companions of <HI>Lions, Wolves</HI> and <HI>Bears:</HI> We may err in our arrangement,
<Q><L>Sed non ut placidis Coeant immitia, non ut</L>
<L>Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN his arrangement of his fourth and fifth orders we quite agree, except in the &s;ingle article <HI>Noctilio,</HI> a &s;pecies of Bat, which happening to have only two cutting teeth in each jaw, is &s;eparated from its com|panions and placed with &s;quirrels, and others of that cla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE &s;ixth order is made up of animals of the hoofed tribe; but of genera &s;o different in their na|ture, that notwith&s;tanding we admit them into the &s;ame divi&s;ion, we place them at &s;uch di&s;tances from each other, with &s;o many intervening links and &s;oftening gradations, as will, it may be hoped, le&s;&s;en the &s;hock of &s;eeing the <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Hippopotame</HI> in the &s;ame piece. To avoid this as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, we have flung the la&s;t into the back ground, where it will appear more tolerable to the Critick than if they were left in a manner conjoined.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">THE la&s;t order is that of Whales; which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, have, in many re&s;pects, the &s;tructure of land animals; but their want of hair and feet, their fi&s;h-like form, and their con&s;tant re&s;idence in the water, are arguments for &s;eparating them from this cla&s;s, and forming them into another indepen|dent of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT while I thus freely offer my objections again&s;t embracing this Sy&s;tem of Quadrupeds, let me not be &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;en&s;ible of the other merits of this great and extraordinary per&s;on: His arrange|ment of fi&s;h, of in&s;ects, and of &s;hells, are original and excellent; he hath, in all his cla&s;&s;es, given phi|lo&s;ophy a new language; hath invented apt names, and taught the world a brevity, yet a fullne&s;s of de&s;cription, unknown to pa&s;t ages; he hath with great indu&s;try brought numbers of &s;ynonyms of every animal into one point of view; and hath given a conci&s;e account of the u&s;es and manners of each, as far as his ob&s;ervation extended, or the in|formation of a numerous train of travelling di&s;ciples could contribute: His Country may triumph in producing &s;o va&s;t a Genius, who&s;e &s;pirit invigorates &s;cience in all that chilly region, and diffu&s;es it from thence to climates more favorable, which gratefully acknowlege the advantage of its influences.</P>
<P>LET us now turn our eyes to a Genius of another kind, to whom the Hi&s;tory of Quadrupeds owes very con&s;iderable lights: I mean M. <HI>de Buffon,</HI> who, in the mo&s;t beautifull language, and in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, hath given the ample&s;t de&s;crip|tions of the oeconomy of the whole four-footed
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
creation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the anatomical part in the province of M. <HI>D' Aubenton.</HI></NOTE>: Such is his eloquence, that we forget the exuberant manner he treats each &s;ubject, and the reflections he often ca&s;ts on other Writers; the creation of his own gay fancy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is not advanced without rea&s;on: B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in our regard to a Gentleman who&s;e abilities we re&s;pect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forbear producing our proofs; not doubting, but when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had time to recollect him&s;elf, he will, by a recantation of a certain g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d&punc; mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion, convince the Publick that his candor is not inferior to his learning and genius.</NOTE>. Having in his own mind a comprehen&s;ive view of every ani|mal, he unfortunately &s;eems to think it beneath him to &s;hackle his lively &s;pirit with &s;y&s;tematic arrange|ment; &s;o that the Reader is forced to wander thro' numbers of volumes in &s;earch of any wi&s;hed-for &s;ub|ject. The mi&s;under&s;tanding between the&s;e two able Naturali&s;ts is mo&s;t injurious to &s;cience. The <HI>French</HI> Philo&s;opher &s;carce mentions the <HI>Suede,</HI> but to treat him with contempt; <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> in return, never deigns even to quote M. <HI>de Buffon,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he mu&s;t know what ample lights he might have drawn from him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in a few words mention the plan that is followed in the pre&s;ent di&s;tribution of quadrupeds, and at the &s;ame time &s;hall clame but a &s;mall &s;hare of originality.</P>
<P>I copy Mr. RAY, in his greater divi&s;ions of ani|mals into <HI>hoofed,</HI> and digitated; but, after the man|ner of Mr. KLEIN, form &s;eparate genera of the <HI>Rhi|noceros, Hippopotame, Tapiir</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;k.</HI> The <HI>Camel</HI> being a ruminating animal, wanting the upper fore|teeth, and having the rudiments of hoofs, is placed
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
in the fir&s;t order, after the <HI>Mu&s;k,</HI> a hornle&s;s cloven-hoofed quadruped.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Apes</HI> are continued in the &s;ame rank Mr. RAY has placed them, and are followed by the <HI>Maucaucos.</HI></P>
<P>THE carnivorous animals deviate but little from his &s;y&s;tem, and are arranged according to that of LINNAEUS, after omitting the <HI>Seal, Mole, Shrew</HI> and <HI>Hedge-hog.</HI></P>
<P>The herbivorous or frugivorous quadrupeds keep here the &s;ame &s;tation that our countryman a&s;&s;igned them; but this cla&s;s comprehends, be&s;ides the <HI>Shrew,</HI> the <HI>Mole</HI> and the <HI>Hedge-hog.</HI> The <HI>Mole</HI> is an exception to the character of this order, in re|&s;pect to the number of its cutting teeth; but its way of life, and its food, place it here more natu|rally than with the <HI>Ferae,</HI> as LINNAEUS has done. The&s;e exceptions are to be met with even in the method <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as the <HI>Trichechus Ro&s;marus,</HI> which has four di&s;tinct grinders in every jaw, the <HI>Phoca Ur&s;ina</HI> and <HI>Leonina,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;tela Lutris,</HI> and the <HI>Sus Hydrochaeris;</HI> and particularly in the genus of <HI>Ve&s;pertilio,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of numbers of &s;pecies, many of which vary greatly in the number of their fore teeth.</NOTE> of that able Naturali&s;t; nor can it be otherwi&s;e in all human &s;y&s;tems; we are &s;o ignorant of many of the links of the chains of beings, that to expect perfection in the arrangement of them would be the mo&s;t weak pre&s;umption. We ought, therefore, to drop all thoughts of forming a &s;y&s;tem of quadrupeds from the character of a &s;ingle part: but if we take combined characters of parts, man|ners and food, we bid much fairer for producing an intelligible &s;y&s;tem, which ought to be the &s;um of our aim.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">THE fourth &s;ection of digitated quadrupeds con|&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e which are ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of cutting teeth, &s;uch as the <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Armadillo.</HI></P>
<P>THE fifth &s;ection is formed of tho&s;e which are de&s;titute of teeth of every kind, &s;uch as the <HI>Manis</HI> and <HI>Ant-eater.</HI></P>
<P>THE third and fourth orders, or divi&s;ions, are the <HI>Pinnated</HI> and the <HI>Winged</HI> Quadrupeds; the fir&s;t takes in the <HI>Walrus</HI> and the <HI>Seals,</HI> and (in confor|mity to preceding Writers) the <HI>Manati.</HI> But tho&s;e that compo&s;e this order are very imperfect: Their limbs &s;erve rather the u&s;e of &s;ins than legs; and their element being for the greate&s;t part the water, they &s;eem as the links between the quadrupeds and the cetaceous animals.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Bats</HI> again are winged quadrupeds, and form the next gradation from this to the cla&s;s of Birds; and the&s;e two orders are the only additions I can boa&s;t of adding in this Work.</P>
<P>SO far of Sy&s;tem; the re&s;t of my plan compre|hends numerous Synonyms of each Animal, a brief de&s;cription, and as full an account of their place, manners, or u&s;es, as could be collected from my own ob&s;ervations, or the information of others; from preceding Writers on the &s;ubject; from printed Voyages of the be&s;t authorities, or from living Voyagers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And it may be added, from the different <HI>Mu&s;eums</HI> at home and abroad, particularly from that matchle&s;s collection in the <HI>Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum;</HI> and, placed as it is under the direction of Gentlemen as much di&s;tingui&s;hed for their politene&s;s as their love of &s;cience, my acce&s;s to its contents, has been rendered, at all fit times, &s;o ea&s;y, as to put this Work under &s;ingular obligations to them.</NOTE>. If it has the fortune to be any-ways
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
u&s;efull to my Countrymen, in promoting the knowlege of Natural Hi&s;tory, my principal object will be an&s;wered: Let it be treated with candor till &s;omething better appears; and when that time comes the Writer will chearfully re&s;ign it to ob|livion, the common fate of antiquated Sy&s;tems.</P>

<P>The Elk was known to the <HI>Romans</HI> by the name of <HI>Alce</HI> and <HI>Machlis:</HI> they believed that it had no joints in its legs; and, from the great &s;ize of the upper lip, imagined it could not feed without going backward as it grazed.</P>
<P>Before I quit this &s;ubject it will be proper to take &s;ome notice of the enormous horns that are &s;o often found fo&s;&s;il in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and which have always been attributed to the Moo&s;e Deer: I mean the Moo&s;e Deer of <HI>Jo&s;&s;elyn;</HI> for no other animal could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry &s;o gigantic a head.

The mea&s;urements of a pair of the&s;e horns are as follow:
<PB N="45" REF="76">
from the in&s;ertion to the tips, 5 feet 5 inches; the brow antlers 11 inches; the broade&s;t part of the palm, 18; di&s;tance between tip and tip, 7 feet 9: but the&s;e are &s;mall in compari&s;on of others that have been found in the &s;ame kingdom. Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> in his <HI>Louthiana, tab.</HI> xxii. Book III. gives the figure of one that was eight feet long, and fourteen be|tween point and point.

<P>A. with a no&s;e and head fourteen inches in length&punc; the no&s;e of a deep red, face blue, both naked: black eye-brows: ears like the human; on the top of the head a long upright tuft of hair; on the chin ano|ther: two long tu&s;ks in the upper jaw: fore feet exactly re&s;embling hands, and the nails on the fin|gers flat: the hind feet have the thumbs le&s;s per|fect, and the nails imbricated: the fore part of the body, and the in&s;ide of the legs and arms, naked: the out&s;ide covered with mottled brown and olive hair; that on the back du&s;ky: the buttocks red, and bare: length, from the no&s;e to the rump, three feet two inches.</P>
<P>A &s;pecies of di&s;gu&s;ting deformity; very fierce and falacious; went on all fours; but would &s;it up on its rump, and &s;upport it&s;elf with a &s;tick: in this atti|tude would hold a cup in its hand, and drink out of it: its food was fruits.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> barely mentions another &s;pecies of ape under the title of <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&s;imia Porcaria.</HI> M. <HI>de Buffon</HI> imagines it to be the baboon; but &s;ince the Philo&s;opher expre&s;ly &s;ays, that his <GAP DESC="foreign">, or apes, had no tails, we cannot a&s;&s;ent to its being the baboon. I rather think it a &s;pecies we have not at pre&s;ent knowlege of. Among my drawings is the copy of one in the <HI>Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum,</HI> with a no&s;e exactly re|&s;embling that of a hog, which po&s;&s;ibly may be <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI>'s animal; but there is no account attending the painting to enable us to trace its hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>Their hou&s;es are made in the water collected by means of the dam, and are placed near the edge of the &s;hore.

The walls are two feet thick; made of earth, &s;tones and &s;ticks, mo&s;t artificially layed together; and the walls within as neatly plai&s;tered as if with a trowel. In each hou&s;e are two openings; one into the water, the other towards the land. The height of the&s;e hou&s;es above the water is eight feet.

Each hou&s;e contains from two to thirty beavers; and the number of hou&s;es in each pond is from ten to twenty-five. Each beaver forms its bed of mo&s;s; and each family forms its magazine of winter provi&s;ion, which con|&s;i&s;ts of bark and boughs of trees.

<P>The <HI>Ur&s;ine</HI> Seal, a name we &s;ub&s;titute for the Sea Bear, leads, during the three months in &s;ummer, a mo&s;t indolent life: it arrives at the i&s;lands va&s;tly fat; but during that time they are &s;carce ever in motion, confine them&s;elves for whole weeks to one
<PB N="345" REF="400">
&s;pot, &s;leep a great part of the time, eat nothing, and, except the employment the females have in &s;uckling their young, are totally inactive: they live in families; each male has from eight to fifty females, whom he guards with the jealou&s;y of an ea&s;tern monarch; and though they lie by thou&s;ands on the &s;hores, each family keeps it&s;elf &s;eparate from the re&s;t, and &s;ometimes, with the young and un|married ones, amount to a hundred and twenty. The old animals, which are de&s;titute of females, or de&s;erted by them, live apart, and are exce&s;&s;ively &s;plenetic, peevi&s;h and quarrel&s;ome: are exce&s;&s;ively fierce, and &s;o attached to their old haunts, that they would die &s;ooner than quit them. They are mon|&s;trou&s;ly fat, and have a mo&s;t hircine &s;mell. If ano|ther approaches their &s;tation, they are rouzed from their indolence and in&s;tantly &s;nap at it, and a battle en&s;ues; in the conflict, they perhaps intrude on the &s;eat of another: this gives new cau&s;e of offence, &s;o in the end the di&s;cord becomes univer&s;al, and is &s;pread thro' the whole &s;hore.</P>
<P>The other males are al&s;o very ira&s;cible: the cau&s;es of their di&s;putes are generally the&s;e. The fir&s;t and the mo&s;t terrible is, when an attempt is made by another to &s;educe one of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, or a young female of the family. This in&s;ult produces a com|bat, and the conqueror is immediately followed by the whole &s;eraglio, who are &s;ure of de&s;erting the unhappy vanqui&s;hed. The &s;econd rea&s;on of a quar|rel is, when one invades the &s;eat of another: the third ari&s;es from their interfering in the di&s;putes of others. The&s;e battles are very violent; the wounds
<PB N="346" REF="401">
they receive are very deep, and re&s;emble the cuts of a &s;abre. At the end of a fight they fling them|&s;elves into the &s;ea, to wa&s;h away the blood.</P>
<P>The males are very fond of their young; but very tyrannical towards the females: if any body attempts to take their cub, the male &s;tands on the defen&s;ive, while the female makes off with the young in her mouth; &s;hould &s;he drop it, the former in|&s;tantly quits his enemy, falls on her, and beats her again&s;t the &s;tones, till he leaves her for dead. As &s;oon as &s;he recovers, &s;he comes in the mo&s;t &s;uppliant manner to the male, crawls to his feet, and wa&s;hes them with her tears: he, in the mean time, &s;talks about in the mo&s;t in&s;ulting manner; but in ca&s;e the young one is carried off, he melts into the deepe&s;t affliction, and &s;hews all &s;igns of deep concern. It is probable that he feels his misfortune the more &s;en&s;i|&s;ibly, as the female generally brings but one at a time; never more than two.</P>
<P>They &s;wim very &s;wiftly, at the rate of &s;even miles an hour. If wounded, will &s;eize on the boat, and carry it along with va&s;t impetuo&s;ity, and oftentimes fink it. They can continue a long time under wa|ter. When they want to climb the rocks they fa&s;ten with the fore paws, and &s;o draw them&s;elves up. They are very tenacious of life, and will live for a fortnight after receiving &s;uch wounds as would im|mediately de&s;troy any other animal.</P>

<P>The teeth lock into each other when the mouth is clo&s;ed: in the upper jaw are four cutting teeth, each bifurcated; on both &s;ides is a &s;mall &s;harp ca|nine tooth bending inwards; near that another, larger: the grinders re&s;emble canine teeth, and are &s;ix in number in each jaw: in the lower jaw are al&s;o four cutting teeth and two canine: but only four grinders in each jaw: in all, thirty-&s;ix teeth.</P>

<P>They arrive on the breeding i&s;lands very fat and full of blood: when they are in motion they &s;eem like a great &s;kin full of oil, from the tremulous movement of the blubber, which has been found to be a foot thick. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> therefore call them

<P>The old animals have a tremendous appearance, yet are exce&s;&s;ively timid, except at the breeding &s;ea&s;on, when they &s;eem to lo&s;e their apprehen&s;ions, and are le&s;s di&s;turbed at the &s;ight of man. At other times, they hurry into the water; or, if awakened out of their &s;leep by a loud noi&s;e, or by blows, fall into va&s;t confu&s;ion, tumble down, and tremble in every part, thro' fear: but if once they find it im|po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<P>The&s;e animals a&s;&s;ociate in families like the for|mer, but not in &s;uch great numbers: the males &s;hew equal jealou&s;y about their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and have bloody combats on their accounts: oftimes there is one of &s;uperior courage to the re&s;t, and procures by dint of valour a greater number of females than

<P>They live perpetually in the water, and frequent the edges of the &s;hores; and in calm weather &s;wim in great droves near the mouths of rivers: in the time of flood they come &s;o near the land that a per|&s;on may &s;troke them with his hand: if hurt, they &s;wim out to &s;ea; but pre&s;ently return again. They live in families, one near another; each con&s;i&s;ts of a male, a female, a half-grown young one, and a very &s;mall one. The females oblige the young to &s;wim before them, while the other old ones &s;urround, and, as it were, guard them on all &s;ides. The af|fection between the male and female is very great; for if &s;he is attacked he will defend her to the utmo&s;t, and if &s;he is killed will follow her corps to the very &s;hore, and &s;wim for &s;ome days near the place it has been landed at.</P>
<P>They copulate in the &s;pring, in the &s;ame manner as the human kind, e&s;pecially in calm weather, to|wards the evening. The female &s;wims gently about; the male pur&s;ues; till tired with wantoning &s;he flings her&s;elf on her back, and admits his embraces <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Leonine</HI> and <HI>Ur&s;ine</HI> &s;eals copulate in the &s;ame manner, only, after &s;porting in the &s;ea for &s;ome time, they come on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e.</NOTE>. <HI>Stel|ler</HI> thinks they go with young above a year: it is

certain that they bring but one young at a time, which they &s;uckle by two teats placed between the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>They are va&s;tly voracious and gluttonous, and feed not only on the <HI>fuci</HI> that grow in the &s;ea, but &s;uch as are flung on the edges of the &s;hore. When they are filled they fall a&s;leep on their backs. Du|ring their meals, they are &s;o intent on their food, that any one may go among them and chu&s;e which he likes be&s;t. <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> gives an in&s;tance of one that lived in a lake of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> for five and twenty years, and was &s;o tame as to come to the edge of the &s;hore on being called; and would even perform the part of a ferry, and carry &s;everal people at a time on its back to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As quoted by <HI>Purchas,</HI> V. 888.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Their back and their &s;ides are generally above water, and as their &s;kin is filled with a &s;pecies of lou&s;e peculiar to them, numbers of gulls are conti|nually perching on their backs and picking out the in&s;ects.</P>
<P>They continue in the <HI>Kamt&s;chatkan</HI> and <HI>American</HI> &s;eas the whole year; but in winter are very lean, &s;o that you may count their ribs. They are taken by harpoons fa&s;tened to a &s;trong cord, and after they are &s;truck it requires the united force of thirty men to draw them on &s;hore. Sometimes when they are transfixed they will lay hold of the rocks with their paws, and &s;tick &s;o fa&s;t as to leave the &s;kin behind before they can be forced off.
