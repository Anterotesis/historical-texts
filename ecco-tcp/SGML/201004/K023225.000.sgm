<HEAD>ANECDOTES OF THE LIFE OF <HI>THOMAS PAINE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE celebrated Author of "THE RIGHTS OF MAN" has not been without his biographer. In a pamphlet which extends to one hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix pages, and which is publi&s;hed under the &s;anction of the fictitious name of <HI>Oldys,</HI> we have been made acquainted with many parti|culars of Mr. PAINE'S private hi&s;tory. This pamphlet is, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and abu&s;ive; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of it had evidently dipped his pen in the bitter &s;pirit of Party Oppo|&s;ition. However, the incidents which it contains &s;eem to have been collected with care and a&s;&s;iduity, and to re&s;t, as to their authenticity, on the evidence of dates and records. It &s;hould be remembered, likewi&s;e, that the&s;e particulars have not been contradicted, either by Mr. PAINE, or by any of his numerous admirers; mo&s;t, if not all, of whom appear to have had no doubt of their reality. Perhaps, the impartial Public may be plea&s;ed with beholding the follow|ing Anecdotes, &s;tript of that <HI>high colouring</HI> which preju|dice and party-malice are capable of giving to truth.</P>
<P>THOMAS PAINE was born at Thetford, in the county of Norfolk, on the 29th of January, 1736-7. His father,
<PB N="iv" REF="4">the &s;on of a &s;mall but reputable farmer, was a &s;tay-make by trade, and a Quaker by religion: his mother was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> daughter of an attorney at Thetford, and of the E&s;tabli&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Church. He was educated at his native town, under the Rev. WILLIAM KNOWLES, ma&s;ter of the grammar &s;choo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at Thetford, and was deemed a boy of con&s;iderable abili|ties, though without much regular application. His &s;tudies were directed, by his expectations, to what is u&s;eful, rather than to what is ornamental;&mdash;to reading, writing, and arithmetic. With this kind of in&s;truction he left the &s;chool, at the age of thirteen, in order to learn his father's bu&s;ine&s;s, which, though he did not like it, he continued to work at for nearly five years.</P>
<P>When almo&s;t twenty, and in the year 1756, the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs entered London, the common receptacle of the &s;illy and the wi&s;e, of the poor and the opulent, of the bu&s;y and the idle. He worked for &s;ome time with Mr MORRIS, a very noted &s;tay-maker, in Hanover-&s;treet Long-Acre. He did not, however, continue long in Lon|don; and it &s;eems probable that this was the period at which he made his &s;ea-faring adventure.</P>
<P>At an early age (as he him&s;elf ob&s;erves,) raw and ad|venturous, and heated with the fal&s;e heroi&s;m of a ma&s;ter who had &s;erved in a man-of-war, he began the career of his own fortune, and entered on board the <HI>Terrible</HI> privateer Captain DEATH. From this adventure he was happil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prevented by the affectionate and moral remon&s;trance of good father, who, from his own habits of life, being of the Quaker profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t have begun to look upon him a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lo&s;t. But the impre&s;&s;ion, much as it effected at the time began to wear away, and he entered afterwards in the <HI>King of Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> privateer, and went with her to &s;ea. What the event of his expedition was, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or other+wi&s;e, we are not informed; but it is certain, that in the way of life he did not continue long, for in the year 175<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we find him at Dover, where he worked at his trade &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> almo&s;t a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>In April 1759 he &s;ettled, as a ma&s;ter &s;tay-maker, Sandwich; and, on the 27th of September following, ma|ried
<PB N="v" REF="5">MARY LAMBERT, a pretty girl of mode&s;t behaviour, and the daughter of an exci&s;eman. At Sandwich, how|ever, he did not continue long: but on the 7th of April, 1760, went, with his wife, to Margate, and a little time af|ter, having lo&s;t his wife, again mingled with the crowds of London.</P>
<P>The trials which our Author had made of his trade, as they had brought him no plea&s;ure and little gain, induced him to renounce it at this time for ever. When a youth, he had enquired into the duty, and envied the perqui&s;ites, of an exci&s;eman. His wife had, doubtle&s;s, &s;poken of the honours and emoluments of her decea&s;ed father. And he was induced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, in July, 1761, to &s;eek for &s;helter in his father's hou&s;e, that he might pro&s;ecute, in quiet privacy at Thetford, the great object of his future cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After fourteen months of &s;tudy, our Author was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the exci&s;e, on the 1&s;t of December, 1762, at the age of twenty-five. He owed this gratification of his wi&s;hes to the friendly interference of Mr. COCKSEDGE, the learned Recorder of Thetford; but in this &s;ituation he did not continue more than two or three years; for it is certain that, whatever was the cau&s;e, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office on the 27th of Augu&s;t, 1765.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this misfortune, our celebrated Author was reduced to great want. He is &s;aid to have been, for &s;ome time, almo&s;t without food and &s;helter. On the 11th of July, 1766, he was re&s;tored to his office; a circum&s;tance which &s;eems to prove that he had not merited his di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mere re&s;toration, however, did not bring him immediate employment. At this interval he was employed to teach Engli&s;h at an academy in Leman-&s;treet, Goodman's-Fields, for which he received a &s;alary of twenty-five pounds a year; and afterwards he lived, for a &s;hort time, in a &s;imilar &s;itu|ation at Ken&s;ington.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">In March, 1768, he was &s;ent to be an exci&s;e officer at Lewes, in Su&s;&s;ex. In this place he lodged with Mr. OL|LIVE, a tobacconi&s;t; after who&s;e death, in 1769, he opened the &s;hop in his own name, as a grocer, and married ELI|ZABETH OLLIVE, the daughter of his late landlord. This period is &s;aid to have been one of the happy parts of his life.</P>
<P>In 1771 he made his fir&s;t appearance as a writer. The poets of Lewes were called upon, by one of the candidates for the <HI>honour</HI> (we mu&s;t not &s;ay, the <HI>intere&s;t</HI>) of repre&s;ent|ing in Parliament the Electors of New Shoreham, to fur|ni&s;h an appropriate &s;ong; and Mr. PAINE obtained the laurel, with three guineas for his labour.</P>
<P>In 1772 a de&s;ign was formed by the exci&s;e-officers throughout the kingdom, to apply to Parliament for &s;ome addition to their &s;alaries. Our Author, being one of the leading men among them, was reque&s;ted to write their <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> which he produced and publi&s;hed, after many months' application. This is an octavo pamphlet of twenty-one pages, which, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Introduction,</HI> is divided into two heads, viz. <HI>The State of the Salary of the Officers of the Exci&s;e;</HI> and <HI>Thoughts of the Corruption ari&s;ing from the Poverty of Exci&s;e Officers.</HI> On the&s;e topics he &s;ays all that the able&s;t writer could have &s;aid. Four thou&s;and of the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> were printed at Lewes; but, notwith&s;tanding this effort, no application was made to Parliament.</P>
<P>In the month of April, 1774, misfortunes crowded fa&s;t upon him. The effects of his &s;hop were &s;old to pay his debts. Having dealt likewi&s;e, as a grocer, in exci&s;eable articles, he was &s;u&s;pected (whether with rea&s;on or other|wi&s;e, does not appear) of unfair practices; and, on the 8th of the &s;ame month, was again di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the exci&s;e after a dozen years &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On the 24th of May following, Mr. PAINE and his wife entered into articles of &s;eparation; and the&s;e articles were in con&s;equence of &s;ome di&s;agreement, again drawn on the 4th of June. Some per&s;ons have not &s;crupled to a&s;&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="vii" REF="7">that he treated his wife with cruelty, and that this was the cau&s;e of their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the year, in con&s;equence of a &s;trong recommendation to Dr. FRANKLIN, he formed the re&s;olution of quirting his native country; and, in the month of September, he &s;et &s;ail for America. He arrived at Philadelphia in the winter, a few months, as he him&s;elf relates, before the battle of Lexington, which was fought in April, 1775.</P>
<P>In the New World, his fir&s;t employment was that of &s;hopman to Mr. AITKIN, an indu&s;trious book&s;eller at Philadelphia, with a &s;alary of twenty pounds a-year. Soon after, he turned chemi&s;t; and in November, as foreign &s;upplies of gunpowder were &s;topped, he employed his fer|tile genius in making experiments for the purpo&s;e of di&s;|covering &s;ome cheap and expeditious method of furni&s;hing Congre&s;s with &s;altpetre.</P>
<P>From this aera he becomes more known, and his con|duct is entitled to particular attention. On the 10th of January, 1776, he publi&s;hed his celebrated pamphlet, in|titled <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> This work was univer&s;ally read, and very generally applauded. The fir&s;t edition was quickly &s;old. A &s;econd, with a Supplement of one third more, was immediately prepared. But let us here attend to Mr. PAINE him&s;elf. Speaking of the te&s;timony which his own heart bore to his integrity, he thus remarks.</P>
<P>"Politics and &s;elf-intere&s;t have been &s;o uniformly con|nected, that the world, from being &s;o often deceived, has a right to be &s;u&s;picious of public characters. But with re|gard to my&s;elf, I am perfectly ea&s;y on this head. I did not, at my fir&s;t &s;etting out in public life, nearly &s;eventeen years ago, turn my thoughts to &s;ubjects of Government from motives of intere&s;t; and my conduct, from that mo|ment to this, proves the fact. I &s;aw an opportunity in which I thought I could do &s;ome good, and I followed ex|tily what my heart dictated. I neither read books, nor
<PB N="viii" REF="8">&s;tudied other people's opinions. I thought for my&s;elf. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;e was this:</P>
<P>"During the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the old Governments in Ame+rica, both prior to, and at the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;truck with the order and decorum with which every thing was conducted, and impre&s;&s;ed with the idea that a little more than what Society naturally performed, was all the Government that was nece&s;&s;ary, and that Monarchy and Ari&s;tocracy were frauds and impo&s;itions upon mankind. On the&s;e principles, I publi&s;hed the pamphlet, <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> The &s;ucce&s;s it met with was beyond any thing &s;ince the invention of printing. I gave the copy-right up to every State in the Union, and the demand ran to not le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and copies."&mdash;Owing to this di&s;in|tere&s;ted conduct of Mr. PAINE, it &s;eems that, notwith|&s;tanding the exten&s;ive &s;ale of the pamphlet, he was in debt to the printer, to the amount of 29l. 12s. 1d.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, 1776, Mr. PAINE joined the army, but in what capacity is not known. It is certain, however, that he accompanied WASHINGTON in his retreat from Hud&s;on's River to the Delaware. At this time the Congre&s;s fled, and all were terrified. But our Author was undi&s;mayed. He &s;aw that the Americans were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of re&s;ources &s;ufficient to authorize hope, and he endea+vourd to in&s;pire others with the &s;ame confidence. Wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this view, on the 19th of December, he publi&s;hed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> wherein he &s;tates every topic of hope, and examine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every motive of apprehen&s;ion. This work, which extended to thirteen Numbers, he publi&s;hed at different interval till the complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Revolution. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> la&s;t Number appeared on the 19th of April, 1783, the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> day that a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities was proclaimed.</P>
<P>In 1777, Congre&s;s unanimou&s;ly, and unknown to M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> PAINE, appointed him Secretary in the Foreign Depar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ment; and from this time he enjoyed the corre&s;ponden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of FRANKLIN. This appointment was agreeable to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> becau&s;e it gave him the opportunity of &s;eeing into the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+lities of Foreign Courts, and their manner of doing bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ne&s;s,
<PB N="ix" REF="9">But a mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;ing between Congre&s;s and him, re&s;pecting one of their Commi&s;&s;ioners, then in Europe, Mr. SILAS DEANE, he re&s;igned the office on the 8th of January, 1779, and declined, at the &s;ame time, the pecuniary offers made him by the Mini&s;ters of France and Spain, M. GERARD, and DON JUAN MIRRALLES.</P>
<P>Soon after this he was made Ma&s;ter of Arts by the Uni|ver&s;ity of Philadelphia; and, in 1780, was cho&s;en a mem|ber of the <HI>American Philo&s;ophical Society,</HI> when it was re|vived by the legi&s;lature of the province of Pen&s;ylvania. His independence, as a political writer, was well known. His patrioti&s;m had gained him many friends; and, among others, it appears that General Wa&s;hington entertained a high &s;en&s;e of the importance of his &s;ervices.&mdash;On account of the&s;e &s;ervices, New-York conferred on him &s;ome for|feited lands at New-Rochelle, and Pen&s;ylvania pre&s;ented him with five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>As his exertions were no longer nece&s;&s;ary in America, be &s;et &s;ail for France in the autumn of 1786, and arrived at Paris in the beginning of the year 1787; carrying with him his fame as a writer, and the model of a bridge, which was &s;hewn to the Academy of Sciences. From Paris he came over to England on the 3d of September; ju&s;t thir|teen years after his departure for Philadelphia. Before the end of the month, he went to Thetford to &s;ee his mo|ther, to whom he allowed 9s. a-week; but, owing to the bankruptcy of the American merchant who was ap|pointed to pay it, this allowance was afterwards &s;top|ped.</P>
<P>During part of the year 1788, Mr. PAINE re&s;ided at Ro|theram in York&s;hire, where his iron bridge was ca&s;t and created, chiefly at the expence of the ingenious Mr. Wal|ter. The de&s;ign, however, had co&s;t our Author a con&s;i|derable &s;um, and the a&s;&s;ignees of the American merchant, finding &s;ix hundred and twenty pounds charged again&s;t him, cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted on the 29th of October, 1789. On this occa&s;ion, two re&s;pectable merchants be|came his bail; and on his paying down four hundred and &s;ixty pounds, which he had received from America, and
<PB N="x" REF="10">giving his note for the remainder, he was &s;et at liberty in November, after three weeks confinement.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the publication of Mr. Burke's <HI>Re|flections on the French Revolution,</HI> Mr. PAINE produced, in the month of February 1791, his well-known Work, intitled, the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> This pamphlet was print|ed for Mr. John&s;on, in St. Paul's Church-Yard: but the work containing &s;ome ju&s;t but &s;evere reflections on various parts of the Engli&s;h government, Mr. John&s;on was induced, by the advice of &s;ome of his friends, to de|cline the publication of it; and, after a month's delay, it was publi&s;hed, on the 13th of March, by Mr. Jordan, in Fleet-Street.</P>
<P>About the middle of May, Mr. PAINE again went to France. When the King fled from Paris, he ob&s;erved to his friend, Mr. Chri&s;tie, <Q>You &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of mo|narchical governments. Here will be a whole nation di&s;turbed by the folly of one man.</Q> On the return of the King, our Author was in con&s;iderable danger. An officer proclaimed the will of the National A&s;&s;embly, that all &s;hould be &s;ilent, and covered. In a moment, all hats were on. Mr. PAINE, however, had lo&s;t his cock|ade, the emblem of liberty and equality. A cry aro&s;e <HI>Ari&s;tocrat! Ari&s;tocrat! A' la lanterne! a' la lanterne!</HI> He was de&s;ired by tho&s;e who &s;tood near him, to put on his hat. And it was not till after &s;ome time, that the mob was &s;atisfied by explanation.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July, he returned to London; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was not thought prudent that he &s;hould attend the cele|bration of the French Revolution. He afterwards dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> up the <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Declaration</HI> of the Gentlemen who me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the Thatched-Hou&s;e-Tavern, on the 20th of Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> following.</P>
<P>In the month of February 1792, appeared the Secon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Part of <HI>Rights of Man;</HI> a publication, which has con|ferred additional celebrity on its Author, and greatly in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="xi" REF="11">the number of converts to the cau&s;e of liberty, and ju&s;t government.</P>
<P>The &s;ale of the&s;e ju&s;tly-admired productions has been much greater than that of, perhaps, any work ever pub|li&s;hed in England. When the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> appeared, the number of copies to which the Fir&s;t Part had extended, including England, Scotland, and Ireland, was not le&s;s than between forty and fifty thou&s;and; and when it is recollected that, exclu&s;ive of the Second, the Fir&s;t Part of the work has now been eight months longer on &s;ale, and that cheap editions of each have been publi&s;hed, very many thou&s;ands of which have been &s;old, the number purcha&s;ed cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to fall far &s;hort of, if indeed it does not exceed, one hundred thou&s;and copies.</P>
<P>Thus have we pre&s;ented to our readers the principal circum&s;tances of Mr. PAINE's hi&s;tory. The changes which he has witne&s;&s;ed have been various; and the man, who can drop a tear of &s;orrow at the recollection of the mi&s;eries of his fellow-creatures, will feel regret &s;till more poignant when contemplating the many difficulties under which that man has laboured, who may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled the BENEFACTOR OF NATIONS. But, perhaps, (as he has well ob&s;erved) it is to his advantage that he has &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip to life. He now knows the value of moral in&s;truction, for he has &s;een the danger of the contrary.</P>
<P>The number of converts to Mr. PAINE's &s;entiments on Civil Government is rapidly encrea&s;ing. It is a cla&s;s which comprehends the mo&s;t truly independent characters throughout the nation; men, who belong to no party but that of truth, and who acknowledge no objects of political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">doration but tho&s;e of public liberty and public happine&s;s. The names of <HI>Pittite</HI> and <HI>Foxite,</HI> with tho&s;e other blan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hments with which <HI>intere&s;t</HI> has contrived to catch the yes and &s;educe the attention of the unthinking and the rulgar, are regarded by them as the rattles of childhood. They a&s;pire to a nobler character; and, in&s;tead of con&s;ign|ing their under&s;tandings to the cu&s;tody of others, are de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mined to take the trouble of thinking for them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12">Yet we would not be uncandid; we would not be un|ju&s;t. Candour is the fair offering of ingenuous excel|lence, and ju&s;tice is the due of all. Many, no doubt, there are who oppo&s;e reformation from conviction, and who&s;e upright hearts, if accompanied with enlightened under|&s;tandings, would &s;trink with horror at the idea of tho&s;e mi&s;eries which the villainy of Kings and Mini&s;ters has al|lotted to their equals. For why mu&s;t the People groan under the load of poverty and want, that State&s;men and Kings may live in &s;plendour?&mdash;But Heaven be prai&s;ed for that light which is already diffu&s;ed, and which will a&s;|&s;uredly di&s;pel that mental darkne&s;s which has &s;o long over|&s;hadowed the earth!</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> as a reward for his public-&s;pirited exertions, is now the &s;ubject of a Govern|ment pro&s;ecution.

<P>AS you opened the debate in the Hou&s;e of Commons, May 25th, on the Proclamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Publi|cations, which that Proclamation (without naming any) calls wicked and &s;editions, and as you applied tho&s;e opprobrious epi|thets to the works entitled "RIGHTS OF MAN," I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to offer any other rea&s;on for addre&s;&s;ing this Letter to you.</P>
<P>I begin, then, at once, by declaring that I do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author, ancient or modern, on the &s;ubject of Government, a &s;pirit of greater be|nignity, and a &s;tronger inculcation of moral principles than in tho&s;e which I have publi&s;hed. They come, Sir, from a man, who, by having lived in different countries, and under different &s;y&s;tems of Government, and who, being intimate in the con&s;truction of them, is a better judge of the &s;ubject than it is po&s;&s;ible that you, from the want of tho&s;e opportu|nities, can be:&mdash;And, be&s;ides this, they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile.</P>
<P>I will further &s;ay, that when that moment arrives in which the be&s;t con&s;olation that &s;hall be left will be that of looking back on &s;ome pa&s;t actions, more virtuous, more meritorious, than the re&s;t, I &s;hall then with happine&s;s remember, among other things. I have written the RIGHTS OF MAN.&mdash;As to what Proclamations, or Pro&s;ecutions, or Place-men, or Place-expectants,
<PB N="2" REF="14">&mdash;tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s, or tho&s;e who are gaping for office, may &s;ay of them, it will not alter their character, either with the world or with me.</P>
<P>Having, Sir, made this declaration, I &s;hall proceed to re|mark, not particularly upon your own Speech on that occa&s;ion, but on any other Speech to which your Motion on that day gave ri&s;e; and I &s;hall begin with that of Mr. ADAM.</P>
<P>This gentleman accu&s;es me of <HI>not</HI> having done the very thing that <HI>I have done,</HI> and which, he &s;ays, if I <HI>had</HI> done, he &s;hould not have accu&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Mr. ADAM, in his Speech, (&s;ee the Morning Chronicle of May 26,) &s;ays, <Q>That he had well con&s;idered the &s;ubject of Con&s;titutional Publications, and was by no means ready to &s;ay (but the contrary) that books of &s;cience upon Govern|ment, though recommending a doctrine or &s;y&s;tem different from the form of our Con&s;titution (meaning that of Eng|land) were fit objects of pro&s;ecution; that if he did, he mu&s;t condemn (which he meant not to do) HARRINGTON for his Oceana, Sir THOMAS MOORE for his Eutopia, and HUME for his Idea of a perfect Common-wealth. But (continued Mr. ADAM) the Publication of Mr. PAINE was very diffe|rent; for it reviled what was <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred</HI> in the Con&s;titu|tion, de&s;troyed every principle of &s;ubordination, and <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;hed nothing in their room.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I readily perceive that Mr. ADAM had not read the <HI>Second</HI> Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I am put under the nece&s;&s;ity, either of &s;ubmitting to an erroneous charge, or of ju&s;tifying my&s;elf again&s;t it; and I certainly &s;hall prefer the latter.&mdash;If, then, I &s;hall prove to Mr. ADAM, that, in my rea&s;oning upon &s;y&s;tems of government in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have &s;hown as clearly, I think, as words can convey ideas, a cer|tain Sy&s;tem of Government, and that not exi&s;ting in theory only, but already in full and e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, and &s;y&s;tema|tically and practically free from all the vices and defects, of the Engli&s;h Government, and capable of producing more happine&s;s to the People, and that al&s;o with an eightieth part of the Taxes, which the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of Engli&s;h Government con|&s;umes. I hope he will do me the ju&s;tice when he next goes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Hou&s;e, to get up and confe&s;s he had been mi&s;taken in &s;ay|ing, that I had <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed nothing, and that I had de&s;troyed every principle of &s;ubordination.</HI> Having thus opened the ca&s;e I now come to the point.</P>
<P>In the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN, I have di&s;tinc|gui&s;ted Government into two cla&s;&s;es or &s;y&s;tems; the one, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hereditary &s;y&s;tem; the other the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have endeavoured &s;hew, and I challenge any man to refute it, that there does n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="3" REF="15">exi&s;t a right to e&s;tabli&s;h hereditary Government; or, in other words, Hereditary Governors; becau&s;e Hereditary Govern|ment always means a Government yet to come, and the ca&s;e always is, that the People who are to live afterwards have always the &s;ame right to chu&s;e a government for them&s;elves, as the People had who lived before them.</P>
<P>In the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have not repeated tho&s;e arguments, becau&s;e they are irrefutable; but have confin|ed my&s;elf to &s;hew the defects of what is called Hereditary Go|vernment, or Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion; that it mu&s;t, from the nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it, from want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capacity.&mdash;James the IId. is recorded as an in|&s;tance of the fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es; and in&s;tances are to be found almo&s;t all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the Hereditary &s;y&s;tem &s;till more &s;trongly, I will now put the following ca&s;e&mdash;Take any fifty men promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and it will be very extraordinary, if, out of that number, one man &s;hould be found, who&s;e principles and talents taken together (for &s;ome might have principles, and o|thers have talents) would render him a per&s;on truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of National Tru&s;t. If, then, &s;uch a fitne&s;s of character could not be expected to be found in more than one per&s;on out of fifty, it would happen but once in a thou&s;and years to the elde&s;t &s;on of any one family, admitting each, on an average, to hold the office twenty years. Mr. A|dam talks of &s;omething in the con&s;titution which he calls <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred,</HI> but I hope he does not mean Hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of na|ture, and of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>When I look into Hi&s;tory, and &s;ee the multitudes of men o|therwi&s;e virtuous, who have died, and their families been ruined in defence of knaves and fools, and which they would not have done had they rea&s;oned at all upon the &s;y&s;tem; I do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind, than to endeavour to break the chains of political &s;uper&s;tition. Tho&s;e chains are now di&s;&s;olving fa&s;t, and proclamation and pro&s;ecu|tion will &s;erve but to ha&s;ten that di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of the Hereditary &s;y&s;tem as a had &s;y&s;|tem, and &s;ubject to every po&s;&s;ible defect; I now come to the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem; and this Mr. ADAM will find &s;tated in the Second Part of the Rights of Man, not only as the be&s;t, but as the only <HI>Theory</HI> of Government under which the liberties of a people can be permanently &s;ecure.</P>
<P>But it is needle&s;s now to talk of mere Theory, &s;ince there is already a Government in full Practice, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon that Theory, or, in other Words, upon the Rights of Man, and
<PB N="4" REF="16">has been &s;o for almo&s;t twenty years. Mr. Pitt, in a &s;peech of his &s;ome &s;hort time &s;ince, &s;aid, <Q>That there never did, and never could exi&s;t a Government e&s;tabli&s;hed upon tho&s;e Rights; and that if it began at noon, it would end at night.</Q> Mr. Pitt is not yet arrived at the degree of a &s;chool-boy in this &s;pecies of knowledge. His practice has been confined to the means of extorting revenue, and his boa&s;t has been&mdash;how much?&mdash;Whereas the boa&s;t of the Sy&s;tem of Government that I am &s;peaking of, is not how much, but how little.</P>
<P>The Sy&s;tem of Government, purely repre&s;entative, unmixed with any thing of hereditary non&s;en&s;e, began in America. I will now compare the effects of that &s;y&s;tem of Government with the &s;y&s;tem of Government in England, both during, and &s;ince the clo&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>So powerful is the Repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, fir&s;t, by combin|ing and con&s;olidating all the parts of a country together, how|ever great the extent; and &s;econdly, by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the Government, or di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them if they prove to be otherwi&s;e, that America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the &s;chemes and projects of the Hereditary Government of England again&s;t her, As the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Revolution and Independence of America is a proof of this fact, it is needle&s;s to enlarge upon it.</P>
<P>I now come to the comparative effect of the two Sy&s;tems &s;ince the clo&s;e of the war; and I reque&s;t Mr. Adam to attend to it.</P>
<P>America had internally &s;u&s;tained the revenge of upwards of &s;even years of war, which England had not. England &s;u&s;tained only the expence of the war; whereas America &s;u&s;tained not only the expence, but the de&s;truction of property committed by both armies. Not a hou&s;e was built during that period, and many thou&s;ands were de&s;troyed. The farms and plantations along the coa&s;t of the country, for more than a thou&s;and miles, were laid wa&s;te. Her commerce was annihilated, her &s;hips were either taken or had rotted within her own harbours. The credit of her funds had fallen upwards of ninety per cent. that is, an o|riginal hundred pounds would not &s;ell for ten pounds. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine &s;he was apparently put back an hundred years when the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> clo&s;ed; which was not the ca&s;e with England.</P>
<P>But &s;uch was the event, that the &s;ame repre&s;entative Sy&s;|tem of Government, though &s;ince better organized, which enabled her to conquer, enabled her al&s;o to recover; and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> now pre&s;ents a more flouri&s;hing condition, and a more happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and harmonized &s;ociety under that &s;y&s;tem of Government that any country in the world can boa&s;t under any other. He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> towns are rebuilt, much better than before; her farms an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plantations are in higher improvement than ever; her com+merce
<PB N="5" REF="17">is &s;pread over the world, and her funds have ri&s;en from le&s;s than ten pounds the hundred to upwards of one hundred and twenty. Mr. Pitt, and his colleagues, talk of the things that have happened in his boyi&s;h Admini&s;tration, without knowing what greater things have happened el&s;ewhere and un|der other &s;y&s;tems of Government.</P>
<P>I next come to &s;tate the expence of the two &s;y&s;tems, as they now &s;tand in each of the countries; but it may fir&s;t be proper to ob&s;erve, that Government in America is what it ought to be, a matter of honour and tru&s;t, and not made a trade of for the purpo&s;e of lucre.</P>
<P>The whole amount of the net taxes in England (exclu&s;ive of the expence of collection, of drawbacks, of &s;eizures and condemnations, of &s;ines and penalties, of fees of office, of liti|gations and informers, which are &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ed means of enforcing them) is &s;eventeen millions. Of this &s;um about nine millions go for the payment of the intere&s;t of the Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Debt, and the remainder, being about eight millions, is for the current annual expences. Thus much for one &s;ide of the ca&s;e. I now come to the other.</P>
<P>The expence of all the &s;everal departments of the general Repre&s;entative Government of the United States of America, extending over a &s;pace of country nearly ten times larger than England, is two hundred and ninety-four thou&s;and five hun|dred and fifty-eight dollars, which, at 4s. 6d. per dollar, is 66, 275l. 11s. &s;terling, and is thus apportioned.</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="18">On account of the incur&s;ions of the Indians on the back &s;et|tlements, Congre&s;s is, at this time, obliged to keep &s;ix thou|&s;and militia in pay, in addition to a regiment of foot, and a battalion of artillery, which it always keeps; and this increa&s;es the expence of the War Department to 390,000 dollars, which is 87, 795l. &s;terling; but when peace &s;hall be concluded with the Indians, the greate&s;t part of this expence will cea&s;e, and the total amount of the expence of Government, including that of the army, will not amount to one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which, as has been already &s;tated, is but an eightieth part of the expences of the Engli&s;h Government.</P>
<P>I reque&s;t Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundas, and all tho&s;e who are talking of Con&s;titutions, and ble&s;&s;ings, and Kings, and Lords, and the Lord knows what, to look at this &s;tatement. Here is a form and &s;y&s;tem of Government, that is better organi&s;ed and better admini&s;tered than any Government in the world, and that for le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum, and yet every Member of Congre&s;s receives, as a compen&s;ation for his time and attendance on public bu&s;ine&s;s, one pound &s;even &s;hillings per day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>This is a government that has nothing to fear. It needs no proclamations to deter people from writing and reading. It needs no political &s;uper&s;tition to &s;upport it. It was by encou|raging di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and rendering the pre&s;s free upon all &s;ubjects of Government, that the principles of Government became up|der&s;tood in America, and the people are now enjoying the pre|&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings under it. You hear of no riots, tumults, and di&s;|orders in that country; becau&s;e there exi&s;ts no cau&s;e to product them. Tho&s;e things are never the effect of Freedom, but o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;traint, oppre&s;&s;ion, and exce&s;&s;ive taxation.</P>
<P>In America there is not that cla&s;s of poor and wretched peo|ple that are &s;o numerou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed all over England, and who are to be told by a Proclamation, that they are happy; and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is in a great mea&s;ure to be accounted for, not by the differenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Proclamations, but by the difference of Governments, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> difference of Taxes between that country and this. What tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> labouring people of that country earn they apply to their own u&s;e, and to the education of their children, and do not pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> away in taxes as fa&s;t as they earn it, to &s;upport Court extrava|gance, and a long enormous li&s;t of Place-men and Pen&s;ioners and be&s;ides this, they have learned the manly doctrine of reve|rencing them&s;elves, and con&s;equently of re&s;pecting each other and they laugh at tho&s;e imaginary beings called Kings an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lords, and all the fraudulent trumpery of Courts.</P>
<P>When Place-men and Pen&s;ioners, or tho&s;e who expect to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch, are lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of a Government, it is not a &s;ign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="7" REF="19">its being a good one. The pen&s;ion li&s;t alone, in England (&s;ee Sir John Sinclair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue, page 6, of the Ap|pendix) is One Hundred and Seven Thou&s;and Four Hundred and Four Pounds, <HI>which is more than the expences of the whole Government of America amount to.</HI> And I am now more con|vinced than before, that the offer that was made to me of a Thou&s;and Pounds, for the copy-right of the Second Part of the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> together with the remaining copy-right of the Fir&s;t Part, was to have effected, by a quick &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, what is now attempted to be done by a pro&s;ecution. The connection which the per&s;on who made that offer has with the King's Printing Office, may furni&s;h part of the means of en|quiring into this affair, when the Mini&s;try &s;hall plea&s;e to bring their pro&s;ecution to i&s;&s;ue. But to return to my &s;ubject.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I re|pent it here, that the &s;ervice of any man, whether called King, Pre&s;ident, Senator, Legi&s;lator, or any thing el&s;e, cannot be worth more to any country, in the regular routine of office, than Ten Thou&s;and Pounds per annum. We have a better man in America, and more of a gentleman than any King I ever knew of, who does not occa&s;ion even half that expence: for, though the &s;alary is fixed at Five Thou&s;and Two Hundred and Sixty-five Pounds, he does not accept it, and it is only the in|cidental expences that are paid out of it. The name by which a man is called is, of it&s;elf, but an empty thing. It is worth and character alone which can render him valuable, for without the&s;e, Kings, and Lords, and Pre&s;idents are but jingling names.</P>
<P>But without troubling my&s;elf about con&s;titutions of Govern|ment, I have &s;hewn in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> that an alliance may be formed between England, France, and America, and that the expence of Government in England may be put back to one million and an half, viz.</P>

<P>There will then remain of the four millions 2,880,000l. I have &s;tated two different methods of appropriating this money. The one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family, at the rate of three or four pounds per ann. for each child; the other is, to apportion it according to the ex|pence of living in different countries; but in either of the&s;e ca&s;es it would, together with the allowance to be made to the aged, completely take off taxes from one third of all the fa|milies in England, be&s;ides relieving all the other families from the burthen of poor-rates.</P>
<P>The whole number of families in England, lotting five &s;ouls to each family, is one million four hundred thou&s;and, of which I take one third, viz. 466,666 to be poor families, who now pay four millions of taxes, and that the poore&s;t pays at lea&s;t four guineas a year; and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other two-thirds. The plan, therefore, as &s;tated in the work is, fir&s;t, to remit or repay, as is already &s;tated, this &s;um of four millions to the poor, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;e|parate them from the others in the pre&s;ent mode of collecting taxes on articles of con&s;umption; and, &s;econdly, to aboli&s;h the poor-rates, the hou&s;e and window-light tax, and to change the Commutation Tax into a progre&s;&s;ive Tax on large e&s;tates, the particulars of all which are &s;et forth in the work, and to which I de&s;ire Mr. ADAM to refer for particulars. I &s;hall here con|tent my&s;elf with &s;aying, that to a town of the population of Manche&s;ter, it will make a difference in its favour, compared with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, of upwards of fifty thou&s;and pounds annually, and &s;o in proportion to all other places throughout the nation. This certainly is of more con&s;equence, than that the Tame &s;ums &s;hould be collected to be afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pent by riotous and profligate courtiers, and in nightly revels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the Star and Garter Tavern, Pall-Mall.</P>
<P>I will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from be Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> which Mr. Dundas (a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olling in luxury at the expence of the nation) has branded with the epithet of "wicked."</P>
<Q>By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, tho&s;e in&s;tru|ments of civil torture, will be &s;uper&s;eded, and the wa&s;teful expence of litigation prevented. The hearts of the humane will not be &s;hocked by ragged and hungry children, and per&s;ons of &s;eventy and eighty years of age begging for brench.

<P>The work now under pro&s;ecution is, I conceive, the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> work which is intended to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the afore&s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|clamation.

<P><PB N="13" REF="25">The work, Sir, in que&s;tion, contains, fir&s;t, an inve&s;tigation of general principles of Government.</P>
<P>It al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hes Government into two cla&s;&s;es or &s;y&s;tems; the one the hereditary &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the other the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem; and it compares tho&s;e two &s;y&s;tems with each other.</P>
<P>It &s;hews, that what is called Hereditary Government cannot exi&s;t as a matter of right, becau&s;e Hereditary Government al|ways means a Government yet to come; and the ca&s;e always is, that tho&s;e who are to live afterwards have always the &s;ame right to e&s;tabli&s;h a Government for them&s;elves as the People had who lived before them.</P>
<P>It al&s;o &s;hews the defect to which Hereditary Government is unavoidably &s;ubject; that it mu&s;t, from the nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle, or unfitted for it from want of capa|city. JAMES the IId. and many others are recorded in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory as proofs of the former of tho&s;e ca&s;es, and in|&s;tances are to be found almo&s;t all over Europe, to prove the truth of the latter.</P>
<P>It then &s;hews, that the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem is the only true &s;y&s;tem of Government; that it is al&s;o the only &s;y&s;tem under which the liberties of any People can be permanently &s;ecure; and further, that it is the only one that can continue the &s;ame equal probability at all times of admitting none but men properly qualified, both by principles and abilities, into the Government, and of excluding &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The work &s;hews al&s;o, by plans and calculations nor hitherto denied nor controverted, not even by the pro&s;ecution that is commenced, that the taxes now exi&s;ting may be reduced at lea&s;t &s;ix millions, that taxes may be entirely taken off from the Poor, who are computed at one third of the nation, and that the taxes on the other two-thirds may be very con&s;iderably re|duced&mdash; that the aged Poor may be comfortably provided for, and the children of poor families properly educated&mdash;that fif|teen thou&s;and &s;oldiers, and the &s;ame number of &s;ailors, may be di&s;banded, and allowed three &s;hillings per week during life out of the &s;urplus taxes; and al&s;o, that a proportionate allow|ance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the remaining &s;oldiers and &s;ailors be encrea&s;ed; and that it is better to ap|ply the &s;urplus taxes to tho&s;e purpo&s;es, than to con&s;ume them on lazy and profligate placemen and pen&s;ioners; and that the revenue, &s;aid to be twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, rai&s;ed by a tax upon coals, and given to the Duke of RICHMOND, is a gro&s;s impo&s;ition upon all the people of London, and ought to be in&s;tantly aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a conci&s;e ab&s;tract of the principles and plans contained in the work that is now pro&s;ecuted, and for the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="14" REF="26">of which the Proclamation appears to be intended: But as it is impo&s;&s;ible that I can, in the compa&s;s of a letter, bring into view all the matters contained in the work, and as it is proper that the Gentlemen who may compo&s;e that Meeting &s;hould know what the merits or demerits of it are, before they come to any re&s;olutions, either directly or indirectly relating thereto, I reque&s;t the honour of pre&s;enting them with one hundred copies of the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN, and al&s;o one thou&s;and copies of my letter to Mr. DUNDAS, which I have directed to be &s;ent to Ep&s;om for that purpo&s;e; and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of pre|&s;enting them to the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet on that occa|&s;ion, with my &s;incere wi&s;hes for their happine&s;s, and for that of the Nation in general.</P>
<P>Having now clo&s;ed thus much of the &s;ubject of my letter, I next come to &s;peak of what has relation to me per&s;onally. I am well aware of the delicacy that attends it, but the purpo&s;e of calling the Meeting appears to me &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with that ju&s;|tice that is always due between man and man, that it is proper I &s;hould (as well on account of the Gentlemen who may meet, as on my own account) explain my&s;elf fully and candidly thereon.</P>
<P>I have already informed the Gentlemen, that a pro&s;ecution is commenced again&s;t a work of which I have the honour and hap|pine&s;s to be the author, and I have good rea&s;ons for believing, that the Proclamation which the Gentlemen are called to con&s;i|der, and to pre&s;ent an Addre&s;s upon, is purpo&s;ely calculated to give an impre&s;&s;ion to the Jury before whom that matter is to come. In &s;hort, that it is dictating a verdict by Proclamation and I con&s;ider the in&s;tigators of the meeting to be held at Ep|&s;om, as aiding and abetting the &s;ame improper, and, in my opinion, illegal purpo&s;e, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I &s;hall now &s;hew.</P>

<P>WHEN I wrote you the Letter which Mr. Horne Tooke did me the favour to pre&s;ent to you, as Chairman of the Meeting held at Ep&s;om, Monday, June 18th, it was not with much expectation that you will do me the ju&s;tice of per|mitting, or recommending it to be publicly read. I am well aware that the &s;ignature of Thomas Paine has &s;omething in it dreadful to &s;inecure Placemen and Pen&s;ioners; and when you, on &s;eeing the Letter opened, informed the Meeting that it was &s;igned Thomas Paine, and added, in a tone of exclamation, "the common enemy of us all;" you &s;poke one of the greate&s;t truths you ever uttered, if you confine the expre&s;&s;ion to men of the &s;ame de&s;cription with your&s;elf; men living in indo|lence and luxury, on the &s;poil and labours of the Public.</P>
<P>The Letter has &s;ince appeared in the Argus, and probably in other papers.

You there &s;ufficiently prov|ed, that I was not mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that the meeting was called to give an indirect aid to the pro&s;ecution commenced a|gain&s;t a work, the reputation of which will long out-live the memory of the Pen&s;ioner I am writing to.</P>
<P>When meetings, Sir, are called by the partizans of the Court to preclude the nation the right of inve&s;tigating Sy&s;tems and Principles of Government, and expo&s;ing errors and defects, under the pretence of pro&s;ecuting an individual&mdash;it furni&s;hes an additional motive for maintaining &s;acred that violated right.</P>
<P>The principles and arguments contained in the work in que&s;|tion, RIGHTS OF MAN, have &s;tood, and they now &s;tand, and I believe ever will &s;tand, unrefuted. They are &s;tated in a fair and open manner to the world, and they have already re|ceived the public approbation of a greater number of men, of
<PB N="16" REF="28">the be&s;t of characters, of every denomination of religion, and of every rank in life, (Placemen and Pen&s;ioners excepted) than all the Juries that &s;hall meet in England, for ten years to come will amount to; and I have moreover good rea&s;ons for believ|ing, that the approvers of that work, as well private as public, are already more numerous than all the pre&s;ent Electors throughout the nation.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s than forty pamphlets, intended as an&s;wers thereto have appeared, and as &s;uddenly di&s;appeared: &s;carcely are the titles of any of them remembered, notwith&s;tanding their en|deavours have been aided by all the daily abu&s;e which the Court and Mini&s;terial News-papers, for almo&s;t a year and a half, could be&s;tow, both upon the work and the author: and now that every attempt to refute, and every abu&s;e has failed, the invention of calling the work a Libel has been hit upon, and the di&s;comfited party has pu&s;illanimou&s;ly retreated to Pro|&s;ecution, and a Jury, and ob&s;cure Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As I well know that a long Letter from me will not be agreeable to you, I will relieve your unea&s;ine&s;s by making it as &s;hort as I conveniently can; and will conclude it with tak|ing up the &s;ubject at that part where Mr. Horne Tooke was interrupted from going on when at the Meeting.</P>
<P>That gentleman was &s;tating, that the &s;ituation you &s;tood in rendered it improper for you to appear <HI>actively</HI> in a &s;cene in which your private intere&s;t was too vi&s;ible: That you were a Bed-chamber Lord at a thou&s;and a year, and a Pen&s;ioner at 3000l. a year more&mdash;and here he was &s;topt by the little, but noi&s;y circle you had collected round you. Permit me then, Sir, to add an explanation to his words, for the bene|fit of your neighbours, and with which, with a few ob&s;erva|tions, I &s;hall clo&s;e my letter.</P>
<P>When it was reported in the Engli&s;h News-papers, &s;ome &s;hort time &s;ince, that the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia had given to one of her minions a large tract of country, and &s;everal thou&s;ands of pea&s;ants as property, it very ju&s;tly provoked indignation and abhorrence in tho&s;e who heard it. But if we compare the mode practi&s;ed in England, with that which appears to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o abhorrent in Ru&s;&s;ia, it will be found to amount to very nearly the &s;ame thing:&mdash;for example:</P>
<P>As the whole of the revenue in England is drawn by taxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the pockets of the people, tho&s;e things called gifts and grants (of which kind are all Pen&s;ions and Sinecure places) and paid out of that &s;tock. The difference, therefore, between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two modes is, that in England the money is collected by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Government, and then given to the Pen&s;ioner, and in Ru&s;&s;ia h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is left to collect it for him&s;elf. The &s;malle&s;t &s;um which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poore&s;t family in a county &s;o near to London as Surry, can b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="17" REF="29">&s;uppo&s;ed to pay annually of taxes, is not le&s;s than &s;ive pounds; and as your &s;inecure of one thou&s;and, and pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and per annum, are made up of taxes paid by eight hun|dred of &s;uch poor families, it comes to the &s;ame thing as if the eight hundred families had been given to you, as in Ru&s;&s;ia, and you had collected money on your own account. Were you to &s;ay that you are not quartered particularly on the peo|ple of Surry, but on the nation at large, objection would amount to nothing: for as there are more pen&s;ioners than counties, every one may be con&s;idered as quartered on that in which he lives.</P>
<P>What honour or happine&s;s you can derive from being the Principal Pauper of the neighbourhood, and occa&s;ioning a greater expence than the poor, the aged, and the infirm, for ten miles round you, I leave you to enjoy. At the &s;ame time I can &s;ee that it is no wonder you &s;hould be &s;trenuous in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a book which &s;trikes at the root of tho&s;e abu&s;es. No won|der that you &s;hould be again&s;t Reforms&mdash;again&s;t the Freedom of the Pre&s;s, and the Right of Inve&s;tigation. To you and to others of your de&s;cription, the&s;e are dreadful things; but you &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider, that the motives which prompt you to <HI>act,</HI> ought, by reflection, to compel you to be <HI>&s;ilent.</HI></P>
<P>Having now returned your compliment, and &s;ufficiently tired your patience, I take my leave of you, with mention|ing, that if you had not prevented my former letter from being read at the Meeting, you would not have had the trouble of reading this; and al&s;o with reque&s;ting, that the next time you call me <HI>"a common enemy,"</HI> you would add, <HI>"of us Sinecure Placemen and Pen&s;ioners."</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>Calais,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 15, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Conceive it nece&s;&s;ary to make you acquainted with the following circum&s;tances. The Department of Calais ha|ving elected me a Member of the National Convention of France, I &s;et off from London the 13th in&s;t. in company with Mr. Fro&s;t, of Spring Gardens, and Mr. Audibert, on of the Municipal Officers of Calais, who brought me the certificate of my being elected. We had not arrived more, I believe, than five minutes at the York Hotel, at Dover, than the train of circum&s;tances began, that I am going to relate. We had ta|ken our baggage out of the carriage and put it into a room, into which we went. Mr. Fro&s;t having occa&s;ion to go out, was &s;topt in the pa&s;&s;age by a gentleman, who told him, he mu&s;t return into the room, which he did, and the gentleman came in with him and &s;hut the door: I had remained in the room. Mr. Audibert had gone to inquire when the packe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to &s;ail. The gentleman then &s;aid, that he was Collector of the Cu&s;toms, and had an information again&s;t us, and mu&s;t examine our baggage for prohibited articles. He produced his commi&s;&s;ion as Collector. Mr. Fro&s;t demanded to &s;ee the information, which the Collector refu&s;ed to &s;hew, and conti|nued to refu&s;e on every demand that we made. The Collecto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then called in &s;everal other officers, and began, fir&s;t, to &s;earc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our pockets. He took from Mr. Audibert, who was then re|turned into the room, every thing he found in his pockets and laid them on the table. He then &s;earched Mr. Fro&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame manner (who, among other things, had the key <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the trunks in his pocket) and then did the &s;ame by me. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Fro&s;t wanting to go out, mentioned it, and was going toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the door, on which the Collector placed him&s;elf again&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> door, and &s;aid nobody &s;hould depart the room. After the ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> had been taken from Mr. Fro&s;t (for I had given him the ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of my trunks beforehand, for the purpo&s;e of his attendi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the baggage to the Cu&s;toms, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Collector a&s;ked us to open the trunks, pre&s;entings us the ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for that purpo&s;e; this we declined to do, unle&s;s he wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="19" REF="31">produce his information, which he again refu&s;ed. The Col|lector then opened the trunks him&s;elf, and took out every pa|per and letter, &s;ealed or un&s;ealed. On our remon&s;trance with him on the bad policy, as well as the illegality of Cu&s;tom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e Officers &s;eizing papers and letters, which were things that did not come under their cognizance, he replied, that the <HI>Proclamation</HI> gave him that authority.</P>
<P>Among the Letters which he took out of my trunk were two &s;ealed letters given into my charge by the American Mi|ni&s;ter at London, one of which was directed to the American Mini&s;ter at Paris; the other to a private gentleman; a letter from the Pre&s;ident of the United States, and a letter from the Secretary of State in America, both directed to me, and which. I had received from the American Mini&s;ter now in London, and were private letters of friend&s;hip; a letter from the Elec|toral Body of the Department of Calais, containing the noti|fication of my being elected to the National Convention; and a letter from the Pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly, inform|ing me of my being al&s;o elected for the Department of Oi&s;e.</P>
<P>As we found that all remon&s;trances with the Collector, on the bad policy and illegality of &s;eizing papers and letters, and detaining our per&s;ons by force, under the pretence of &s;earch|ing for prohibited articles, were vain (for he ju&s;tified him&s;elf on the <HI>Prolamation,</HI> and on the information which he refu&s;ed to &s;hew) we contented our&s;elves with a&s;&s;uring him, that what he was then doing he would afterwards have to an&s;wer for, and left it to him&s;elf to do as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It appeared to us that the Collector was acting under the di|rection of &s;ome other per&s;on or per&s;ons then in the hotel, but whom he did not chu&s;e we &s;hould &s;ee, or who did not chu&s;e to be &s;een by us; for the Collector went &s;everal times out of the room for a few minutes, and was al&s;o called out &s;everal times.</P>
<P>When the Collector had taken what papers and letters he plea&s;ed out of the trunks, he proceeded to read them. The fir&s;t letter he took up for this purpo&s;e was that from the Pre&s;ident of the United States to me. While he was doing this, I &s;aid, that it was very extraordinary that General Wa&s;hington could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot write a letter of private friend&s;hip to me without its being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ject to be read by a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officer. Upon this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Fro&s;t laid his hand over the face of the letter, and told the Collector he &s;hould not read it, and took it from him. Mr. Fro&s;t, then ca&s;ting his eye on the concluding paragraph of he letter, &s;aid, I will read this part to you, which he did; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f which the following is an exact tran&s;cript&mdash;<Q>and as no one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> can feel a greater intere&s;t in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">appine&s;s of mankind than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o, it is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart, that the enlightened po|licy
<PB N="20" REF="32" MS="y">of the pre&s;ent age may diffu&s;e to all men tho&s;e ble&s;&s;|ings to which they are entitled, and lay the foundation of happine&s;s to future generations.</Q></P>
<P>As all the other letters and papers lay then on the table, the Collector took them up, and was going out of the room with them. During the tran&s;actions already &s;tated, I contented my&s;elf with ob&s;erving what pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;poke but little; but on &s;eeing the Collector going out of the room with the letters, I told him that the papers and letters then in his hand, were either belonging to me, or entru&s;ted to my charge, and that as I could not permit them to be out of my &s;ight, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on going with him.</P>
<P>The Collector then made a li&s;t of the letters and papers, and went out of the room, giving the letters and papers into the charge of one of the officers. He returned in a &s;hort time, and after &s;ome trifling conver&s;ation, chiefly about the Proclama|tion, told us that he &s;aw <HI>the information was ill-founded,</HI> and a&s;ked if we cho&s;e to put the letters and papers in the trunk our|&s;elves: which, as we had not taken them out, we declined doing, and he did it him&s;elf, and returned us the keys.</P>
<P>In &s;tating to you the&s;e matters, I make no complaint again&s;t the per&s;onal conduct of the Collector, or of any of the Officers Their manner was as civil as &s;uch an extraordinary piece of bu&s;ine&s;s could admit of.</P>
<P>My chief motive in writing to you on this &s;ubject is, that you may take mea&s;ures for preventing the like in future, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only as it concerns private individuals, but in order to preve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a renewal of tho&s;e unplea&s;ant con&s;equences that have here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+fore ari&s;en between nations from circum&s;tances equally as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ignificant.
