<P>WEIGHT four pounds and an half. Head &s;mall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DESCRIPTION.</NOTE> covered with a naked wrinkled red &s;kin, be&s;et with black bri&s;tles. This gives it &s;ome re&s;emblance to a Turkey; from which it derives one of the names. The no&s;trils are very large, and pervious: the whole plumage is du&s;ky, da&s;hed with purple and green: legs of a dirty fle&s;h-color: claws black.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are common from <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> to <HI>Terra del Fuego;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLACE.</NOTE> but &s;warm in the hotter parts of <HI>America;</HI> and are found in the i&s;lands, where they are &s;aid to be far inferior in &s;ize to tho&s;e of <HI>North Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P>In the warm climates they keep in va&s;t flocks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE> Perch at night on rocks or trees; &s;itting with di&s;hevelled wings to purify their bodies,
<PB N="192" REF="7">
which are mo&s;t offen&s;ively fetid. Towards morning they take flight, &s;oaring at a va&s;t height, with the gentle motion of a kite; expecting notice of their banquet by the tainted effluvia of carrion, excrements, or any filth. They have mo&s;t &s;agacious no&s;trils, and &s;mell their prey at a va&s;t di&s;tance; to which they re&s;ort from all quarters, wheeling about, and making a gradual de&s;cent till they reach the ground. They do not confine them&s;elves to dead animals, but feed on Snakes, and &s;ometimes on Lambs. They are very tame, and, while they are at their meals, will &s;uffer a very near approach.</P>
<P>In the torrid zone, particularly about <HI>Carthagena,</HI> they haunt in|habited places, and are &s;een in numbers &s;itting on the roofs of the hou&s;es, or walking along the &s;treets with a &s;luggi&s;h pace. In tho&s;e parts they are u&s;eful, as the IBIS in <HI>Egypt,</HI> devouring the noi&s;ome &s;ubjects, which would otherwi&s;e, by the intolerable &s;tench, render the climate &s;till more unwhole&s;ome than it is.</P>
<P>When the&s;e birds find no food in the cities, they are driven by hunger among the cattle of the neighboring pa&s;tures. If they &s;ee a bea&s;t with a &s;ore on the back, they in&s;tantly alight on it, and at|tack the part affected. The poor animal attempts in vain to free it&s;elf from the devourers, rolling on the ground with hideous cries: but in vain; for the Vultures never quit hold, till they have effected its de&s;truction. Sometimes an Eagle pre&s;ides at the banquet, and keeps the&s;e cowardly birds at a di&s;tance, until it has fini&s;hed its re|pa&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">USES.</NOTE>Mi&s;chievous as they are in a few in&s;tances, yet, by the wi&s;e and beneficent di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, they make in the hot climates full recompence, by le&s;&s;ening the number of tho&s;e de&s;tructive ani|mals the Alligators, which would otherwi&s;e become intolerable by their multitudes. During the &s;ea&s;on in which the&s;e reptiles lay their eggs in the &s;and, the Vultures will &s;it hid in the leaves of the trees, watching the coming of the female Alligator to depo&s;it its eggs, who then covers them with &s;and, to &s;ecure them, as &s;he ima|gines, from all danger: but no &s;ooner does &s;he retire into the water,

<P>THIS mo&s;t beautiful and &s;carce &s;pecies is entirely white, except the tips of the wings, which are black. We know nothing of this bird, but what is collected from <HI>Du Pratz</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>ii. 75.</HI> Latham, <HI>i. 36.</HI></NOTE>. The natives of <HI>Loui&s;iana</HI> &s;et a high value on the feathers, and give a large price for tho&s;e of the wings; with them they adorn the Calumet, or pipe of peace. Different nations make u&s;e of the wings, or feathers of different birds; but, according to <HI>Hennepin,</HI> always decorate it with the mo&s;t beautiful.</P>
<P>The Calumet is an in&s;trument of the fir&s;t importance among the <HI>Americans.</HI> It is nothing more than a pipe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALUMET.</NOTE> who&s;e bowl is generally made of a &s;oft red marble<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Du Pratz, <HI>i. 298.</HI> Kalm, <HI>iii. 230.</HI></NOTE>: the tube of a very long reed, orna|mented with the wings and feathers of birds. No affair of con&s;e|quence is tran&s;acted without the Calumet. It ever appears in meet|ings of commerce, or exchanges; in congre&s;&s;es for determining of peace or war; and even in the very fury of a battle. The accept|ance of the Calumet is a mark of concurrence with the terms pro|po&s;ed; as the refu&s;al is a certain mark of rejection. Even in the rage of a conflict this pipe is &s;ometimes offered; and if accepted, the weapons of de&s;truction in&s;tantly drop from their hands, and a truce en&s;ues. It &s;eems the &s;acrament of the Savages; for no compact is ever violated, which is confirmed by a whiff from this holy reed. The <HI>Dance of the Calumet</HI> is a &s;olemn rite which always confirms a peace, or precedes a war. It is divided into three parts: the fir&s;t, appears an act of devotion, danced in mea&s;ured time: the &s;econd, is a true repre&s;entation of the Pyrrhic dance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> lib. x. p. 736. edit. <HI>Am&s;tel.</HI> 1707.</NOTE>: the third, is attended with &s;ongs expre&s;&s;ive of the victories they had obtained, the nations they had conquered, and the captives they had made.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="13">From the winged ornaments of the <HI>Calumet,</HI> and its conciliat|ing u&s;es, writers compare it to the <HI>Caduceus</HI> of <HI>Mercury,</HI> which was carried by the <HI>Caduceatores,</HI> or me&s;&s;engers of peace, with terms to the ho&s;tile &s;tates. It is &s;ingular, that the mo&s;t remote nations, and the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite in their other cu&s;toms and manners, &s;hould in &s;ome things have, as it were, a certain con&s;ent of thought. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Americans</HI> had the &s;ame idea, in the invention of the <HI>Caduceus</HI> of the one, and the <HI>Calumet</HI> of the other. Some authors imagine, that among the <HI>Greeks</HI> the wings were meant as a &s;ymbol of elo|quence. I rather think that the twi&s;ted Serpents expre&s;&s;ed that in|&s;inuating faculty; and that the emblem was originally taken from the fatal effect the rhetoric of <HI>Satan</HI> had on our great mother, when he a&s;&s;umed the form of that reptile, which the highe&s;t authority repre|&s;ents as <HI>more &s;ubtile than any bea&s;t of the field.</HI> On this the heathen mythology formed their tale of <HI>Jupiter</HI> taking the figure of a Serpent, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the good graces of <HI>Olympias;</HI> who, like <HI>Eve,</HI> fell a victim to his per&s;ua&s;ive tongue. As to the wings, it is mo&s;t probable that they were to &s;hew the flight of di&s;cord; which the re|conciled parties gave, with all the horrors of war, to the air, and &s;port of the winds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oole,</HI> or Eagle, is a &s;acred bird among the <HI>Americans.</HI> In ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, they invoke this bird to de&s;cend from heaven (which in its exalted flight it approaches nearer than any other) and bring down refre&s;hing things; as it can dart down on its rapid wing quick as a fla&s;h of lightning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adair's Hi&s;t.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ANTIQUITY OF FALCONRY.</NOTE>I cannot fix the preci&s;e time of the origin of falconry; the pa&s;|&s;age in <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and the epigram in <HI>Martial,</HI> do by no means fix it to the periods in which they wrote.

That the &s;pot was much frequented by Hawks, which were wont to appear on hearing them&s;elves called: and would drive the little birds into the bu&s;hes, where they were caught by the children; and that the Hawks would even &s;ometimes take the birds and fling them to the&s;e young &s;port&s;men; who (after fini&s;hing their diver&s;ion) gratefully be&s;towed on their a&s;&s;i&s;tants part of their prey.</Q> This tale may have &s;ome truth at the bottom;
<PB N="219" REF="36">
it being notorious that Larks, and even Partridges, will, by the ter|ror of a Hawk pa&s;&s;ing over them, lie &s;o &s;till as to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taken by any pa&s;&s;enger. Here &s;eems to have been no training of the&s;e <HI>Thracian</HI> Hawks, but a mere ca&s;ual concurrence of Hawks and &s;mall birds, which afforded now and then an amu&s;ement to the youth of the country. The thought expre&s;&s;ed on the antient gem, of little <HI>Genii</HI> engaged in the chace of Deer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by an Eagle, may have originated from this &s;tory.</P>
<P>The Poet only de&s;cribes another kind of bird-catching, in the following epigram on the fate of a Hawk:
<Q><L>Praedo fuit volucrum, famulus nunc Aucupis, idem</L>
<L>Decipit, et captas non &s;ibi, moeret, aves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. xiv. ep. 216.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
By the word <HI>decipit,</HI> it is plain that the Hawk was not trained; but was merely u&s;ed as a &s;tale, either to entice &s;mall birds under a net, or to the limed twigs: the la&s;t is a method &s;till in u&s;e in <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> call it <HI>Uccellare con la Civetta;</HI> for in&s;tead of a Hawk, they place a &s;mall &s;pecies of Owl on a pole, in the middle of a field; and &s;urround it, at various di&s;tances, with lime-twigs. The &s;mall birds, from their &s;trange propen&s;ity to approach rapacious fowls, fly around, perch on the rods, and are taken in great numbers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olina, <HI>65.</HI></NOTE>. A Hawk would &s;erve the purpo&s;e full as well. <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions the u&s;e of bird-lime<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t. Nat.</HI> lib. xci. c. 44.</NOTE>; and <HI>Longus,</HI> in his elegant romance of <HI>Daphnis</HI> and <HI>Chloe,</HI> employs the latter to catch little birds for his beloved<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fr.</HI> ed. octavo, 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I cannot find any certainty of Hawks being trained for diver&s;ion before the time of King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> monarch; who died in the year 760<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Saxon Chr. <HI>60.</HI></NOTE>. He wrote into <HI>Germany</HI> for a brace of Falcons, which would fly at Cranes and bring them to the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Quoted by Mr.</HI> Whitaker <HI>in</HI> Hi&s;t. Manche&s;ter, <HI>from</HI> Max.

<PB N="220" REF="37">
baro&s;&s;a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spelman's Glo&s;&s;.</NOTE>, who was drowned in 1189. By the application of <HI>Ethelbert</HI> to <HI>Boniface,</HI> archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> for the brace of Falcons, it is evi|dent, that the diver&s;ion was in perfection in <HI>Germany</HI> before the year 752, the time in which that prelate was martyred by the Pagans. It &s;eems to me highly probable, that falconry was invented in <HI>Scythia,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed from thence into the northern parts of <HI>Europe. Tartary</HI> is even at pre&s;ent celebrated for its fine breed of Falcons; and the &s;port is in &s;uch general e&s;teem, that, according to <HI>Olearius, there was no hut but what had its Eagle or Falcon</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olearius's travels, <HI>177.</HI></NOTE>. The boundle&s;s plains of that country are as finely adapted to the diver&s;ion, as the wooded or mountanous nature of mo&s;t part of <HI>Europe</HI> is ill calculated for that rapid amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The antiquity of falconry in <HI>Tartary</HI> is evinced by the exhibition of the &s;port on the very antient tombs <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strahlenberg,</HI> tab. A. B.</NOTE> found in that country; in which are figured hor&s;emen at full &s;peed, with Hawks on their hands: others again, in the &s;ame attitude, di&s;charging their arrows at their game, in the very manner of the antient <HI>Scythians.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Germany,</HI> falconry got footing in <HI>England;</HI> and became &s;o favored a diver&s;ion, that even &s;anguinary laws were enacted for the pre&s;ervation of rapacious fowls. <HI>Edward</HI> III. made it death for the &s;tealing of a Hawk: and to take its eggs, even in a per&s;on's own ground, was puni&s;hable with a fine at the king's plea&s;ure, and im|pri&s;onment for a year and a day. In the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. the amu&s;e|ment was carried to &s;uch an extravagant pitch, that Sir <HI>Thomas Mon|&s;on</HI> is &s;aid to have given a thou&s;and pounds for a ca&s;t of Hawks.</P>

They were not the <HI>Europeans</HI> alone, who were &s;truck with its great beauty; the natives of <HI>America,</HI> to whom it was &s;o fa|miliar, were affected with its gemmeous appearance, and be&s;towed on it titles expre&s;&s;ive of its re&s;plendent colors.

<P><PB N="292" REF="112">Wild Turkies pre&s;erve a &s;amene&s;s of coloring. The tame, as u&s;ual with dome&s;tic animals, vary.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE>The manners of the&s;e birds are as &s;ingular as their figure. Their attitudes in the &s;ea&s;on of court&s;hip are very &s;triking. The males fling their heads and neck backwards, bri&s;tle up their feathers, drop their wings to the ground, &s;trut and pace mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly; wheel round the females, with their wings ru&s;tling along the earth, at the &s;ame time emitting a &s;trange found through their no&s;trils, not unlike the <HI>grurr</HI> of a great &s;pinning-wheel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">NOTES.</NOTE> On being interrupted, fly into great rages, and change their note into a loud and guttural gobble; and then return to dalliance.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the females is plaintive and melancholy.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="113">The pa&s;&s;ions of the males are very &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed by the change of colors in the fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance of the head and neck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IRASCIBLE.</NOTE> which alters to red, white, blue, and yellowi&s;h, as they happen to be affected. The &s;ight of any thing red excites their choler greatly.</P>
<P>They are polygamous, one cock &s;erving or hens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">POLYGAMOUS.</NOTE> They lay in the &s;pring; and will lay a great number of eggs. They will per&s;i&s;t in laying for a great while. They retire to &s;ome ob&s;cure place to &s;it, the cock, through rage at lo&s;s of its mate, being very apt to break the eggs. The females are very affectionate to the young, and make great moan on the lo&s;s of them. They &s;it on their eggs with &s;uch per&s;everance, that, if they are not taken away when addle, the hens will almo&s;t peri&s;h with hunger before they will quit the ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Turkies greatly delight in the &s;eeds of nettles; but tho&s;e of the purple Fox-glove prove fatal to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Buffon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are very &s;tupid birds; quarrel&s;ome, and cowardly. It is diverting to &s;ee a whole flock attack the common Cock; who will for a long time keep a great number at bay.</P>
<P>They are very &s;wift runners, in the tame as well as the wild &s;tate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SWIFT.</NOTE> They are but indifferent flyers.

<P>The fle&s;h of the wild Turkey is &s;aid to be &s;uperior in goodne&s;s to the tame, but redder.

<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> make a mo&s;t elegant cloathing of the feathers.

<P>When di&s;turbed, they do not take to wing, but run out of &s;ight. It is u&s;ual to cha&s;e them with dogs; when they will fly, and perch on the next tree.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">MANNERS.</NOTE>The hi&s;tory of this &s;pecies is very curious: all which I beg leave to tran&s;cribe from Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> according to the accounts given him by Mr. <HI>Bartram</HI> and Mr <HI>Brooke,</HI> who had frequent op|portunity of ob&s;erving its manners; to which I &s;hall add another, borrowed from the Travels of the Baron <HI>La Hontan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">FROM MR. BAR|TRAM.</NOTE><Q>He is (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Bartram</HI>) a fine bird when his gaiety is di&s;|played; that is, when he &s;preads his tail like that of a Turkey-cock, and erects a circle of feathers round his neck like a ruff, walking very &s;tately with an even pace, and making a noi&s;e &s;ome|thing like a Turkey; at which time the hunter mu&s;t fire immedi|ately at him, or he flies away directly two or three hundred yards, before he &s;ettles on the ground. There is &s;omething very remark|able in what we call their thumping; which they do with their wings, by clapping them again&s;t their &s;ides, as the hunters &s;ay. They &s;tand upon an old fallen tree, that has lain many years on the ground, where they begin their &s;trokes gradually, at about two &s;e|conds of time di&s;tant from one another, and repeat them quicker and quicker, until they make a noi&s;e like thunder at a di&s;tance; which continues, from the beginning, about a minute; then cea&s;|eth for about &s;ix or eight minutes before it begins again. The &s;ound is heard near half a mile, by which means they are di&s;|covered by the hunters, and many of them killed. I have &s;hot many of them in this po&s;ition; but never &s;aw them thump, they mo&s;tly &s;eeing me fir&s;t, and &s;o left off. They commonly exerci&s;e in thumping &s;pring and fall, at about nine or ten in the morning,
<PB N="303" REF="123">
and four or five in the afternoon. Their food is chiefly ber|ries and &s;eeds of the country: their fle&s;h is white, and choice food. I believe they breed but once a year, in the &s;pring, and hatch twelve or fourteen at a brood; which keep in a company till the following &s;pring. Many have attempted to rai&s;e the young ones, and to tame them; but to no purpo&s;e. When hatched under a hen, they e&s;cape into the woods &s;oon after they are hatched, where they either find means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or peri&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this bird is thus further illu&s;trated by Mr. <HI>Brooke</HI> of <HI>Maryland,</HI> in <HI>North America:</HI> <Q>The ruffed Grous, or Phea&s;ant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MR. BROOKE.</NOTE> breeds in all parts of <HI>Maryland,</HI> &s;ome countries on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore excepted. They lay their eggs in ne&s;ts they make in the leaves, either by the &s;ide of fallen trees, or the roots of &s;tanding ones. They lay from twelve to &s;ixteen eggs: the time of incu|bation is in the &s;pring; but how long their eggs are hatching I cannot &s;ay; but probably it is three weeks, the time that a Dunghill Hen &s;its. I have found their ne&s;ts when a boy, and have endeavoured to take the old Phea&s;ant, but never could &s;ucceed: &s;he would almo&s;t let me put my hand upon her before &s;he would quit her ne&s;t; then by artifice &s;he would draw me off from her eggs, by fluttering ju&s;t before me for a hundred paces or more; &s;o that I have been in con&s;tant hopes of taking her. They leave their ne&s;ts as &s;oon as they are hatched; and I believe they live at fir&s;t on ants, &s;mall worms, &amp;c. When they are a few days old, they hide them&s;elves &s;o artfully among the leaves, that it is dif|ficult to find them: as they grow up, they feed on various berries, fruits, and grain of the country: grapes they likewi&s;e are fond of in the &s;ea&s;on; but the Phea&s;ant is more particularly fond of the ivy-berry. I do not know any other animal that feeds on this berry: I know it is poi&s;on to many. Though the Phea&s;ant hatches many young at a time, and often &s;its twice a year, the great num|ber and variety of Hawks in <HI>Maryland</HI> feeding on them, prevents their increa&s;ing fa&s;t. The beating of the Phea&s;ant, as we term it, is a noi&s;e chiefly made in the &s;pring of the year by the cock-bird;
<PB N="304" REF="124">
it may be di&s;tinctly heard a mile in a calm day: they &s;well their brea&s;ts like the Powting Pigeon, and heat with their wings, which make a noi&s;e not unlike a drum in &s;ound; but the Phea&s;ant &s;hor|tens each &s;ounding note, till they run one into another undi&s;tin|gui&s;hably, like &s;triking two empty bottles together.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">LA HONTAN.</NOTE>In order to perfect, as far as I am able, the hi&s;tory of this bird, I &s;hall give a quotation from Baron <HI>La Hontan's Voyages to North America,</HI> publi&s;hed in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> (vol. i. p. 67.) where he &s;peaks of a bird found near the lakes of <HI>Canada,</HI> which, I think, can be no other than the above-de&s;cribed, though the names given them di&s;agree.</P>
<P><HI>La Hontan</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I went in company with &s;ome <HI>Canade&s;e</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee that fowl flap with its wings: believe me, this &s;ight is one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities in the world; for their flapping makes a noi&s;e much like a drum, for about the &s;pace of a minute; then the noi&s;e cea&s;es for half a quarter of an hour; after which it begins again. By this noi&s;e we were directed to the place where the unfortunate More-hen &s;at, and found them upon rotten mo&s;&s;y trees. By flapping one wing again&s;t the other they mean to call their mates; and the humming noi&s;e that en&s;ues thereupon may be heard half a quarter of a league. This they do in the months of <HI>April, May, September,</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> and, which is very re|markable, the More-hen never flaps in this manner but upon one tree. It begins at break of day, and gives over at nine o'clock in the morning, till about an hour before &s;un-&s;et, then it flutters again, and continues &s;o to do till night.</Q></P>

When di&s;turbed, or while flying, it makes a repeated noi&s;e of <HI>cuck, cuk;</HI> and makes a noi&s;e with the feathers of its tail like the cracking of a fan. The fle&s;h of the&s;e birds is of a light brown color, plump, and very juicy.</P>

<P>The le&s;&s;er variety is not unknown in <HI>America.</HI> The &s;ort here de&s;cribed is found in amazing quantities, e&s;pecially about <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay,</HI> where they breed in all parts along the coa&s;ts, make their ne&s;ts on dry ridges on the ground, and lay from nine to eleven eggs, powdered with black.</P>
<P>This is the only &s;pecies of Grous in <HI>N. America</HI> to which Providence hath given that warm protection to its feet, evidently to &s;ecure them again&s;t the cold of their winter lodgings: and, as they are greatly &s;ought after by Eagles, Owls, and other birds of prey, a fine provi&s;ion is made for their &s;afety, by the change of color, which renders them not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;now they lie on.</P>
<P>Every morning they take a flight into the air directly upwards, to &s;hake the &s;now from their wings and bodies. They feed in the mornings and evenings, and in the middle of the day ba&s;k in the &s;un. In the morning they call to one another with a loud note, interrupted; feeding in the intervals, and calling again.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> they a&s;&s;emble in flocks of two hundred, and live much among the willows, the tops of which they eat; whence they are called <HI>Willow Partridges.</HI> About the beginning of <HI>December</HI> they appear in le&s;s plenty, retiring from the flats about the &s;ettlements on <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay</HI> to the mountains, where in that month the &s;now is le&s;s deep than in the lowlands, to feed on cranberries and other berries<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Drage's Voy. <HI>i. 174.</HI></NOTE>. In <HI>Greenland</HI> they re&s;ort in &s;ummer to the mountains for the &s;ake of the crowberries<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Empetrum Nigrum. See <HI>Crantz. Greenl.</HI> i. 64, 75.</NOTE>, which they eat even with the leaves of the plant. In winter they de&s;cend to the &s;hores, where the winds &s;weep the &s;now off the rocks, and enable them to pick up a &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="131">They are an excellent food, and much &s;earched after by the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> in <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay.</HI> They are generally as tame as chickens, e&s;pecially in a mild day: &s;ometimes they are rather wild; but by being driven about, or &s;hot at with powder, they grow &s;o weary, by the &s;hort flights they take, as &s;oon to become very tame again. Sometimes the hunters, when they &s;ee the birds likely to take a long flight, imitate the crying of a Hawk, which intimidates them &s;o much, that they in&s;tantly &s;ettle. When the female is killed, the male can &s;carcely be forced from the body of its mate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Groenl. <HI>p. 117.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual method of taking them is in nets made of twine, twen|ty feet &s;quare, fa&s;tened to four poles, and &s;upported in front in a perpendicular direction with &s;ticks. A long line is fa&s;tened to the&s;e props, the end of which is held by a per&s;on who lies concealed at a di&s;tance. Several people are then employed to drive the birds within reach of the net, which is then pulled down, and often covers at one haul fifty or &s;eventy. At this time they are &s;o plentiful, that ten thou&s;and are taken for the u&s;e of the &s;ettlement from <HI>November</HI> to the end of <HI>April.</HI> In former days, they mu&s;t have been infinite|ly more numerous; for Sir <HI>Thomas Button</HI> relates, that when he wintered there in 1612, he took eighteen hundred dozens of the&s;e and other fowl<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quoted in <HI>North-we&s;t Fox,</HI> 228.</NOTE>: but this is a trifle to the &s;ucce&s;s of M. <HI>Jeremie,</HI> who a&s;&s;erts, that there were eaten in one winter, between him&s;elf and &s;eventy-nine others, ninety thou&s;and Grous, and twenty-five thou|&s;and Rabbets<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Recucil de Voy. au Nord. iii. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Laplanders</HI> take them by forming a hedge with the boughs of birch-trees; leaving &s;mall openings at certain intervals, and hang in each a &s;nare. The birds are tempted to come and feed on the buds or catkins of the birch; and whenever they endeavour to pa&s;s through the openings they are in&s;tantly caught.</P>

<P><Q>I think,</Q> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Blackburne,</HI> <Q>this as remarkable a bird as any in <HI>America.</HI> They are in va&s;t numbers in all parts, and have been of great &s;ervice at particular times to our garri&s;ons, in &s;up|plying them with fre&s;h meat, e&s;pecially at the out-po&s;ts. A friend told me, that in the year in which <HI>Quebec</HI> was taken, the whole army was &s;upplied with them, if they cho&s;e it. The way was this: every man took his club (for they were forbid to u&s;e their firelocks) when they <HI>flew,</HI> as it was termed, in &s;uch quan|tities, that each per&s;on could kill as many as he wanted. They in general begin to fly &s;oon after day-break, and continue till nine or ten o'clock; and again about three in the afternoon, and continue till five or &s;ix: but what is very remarkable, they always fly we&s;terly. The times of flying here are in the &s;pring, about the latter end of <HI>February</HI> or the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> and continue every day for eight or ten days; and again in the fall, when they begin the latter end of <HI>July</HI> or the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> They catch va&s;t quantities of them in clap-nets, with &s;tale pigeons. I have &s;een them brought to this market by &s;acks-full. People in general are very fond of them; and I have heard many &s;ay they think them as good as our common Blue Pigeon; but I cannot agree with them by any means. They ta&s;te more like our Quee&s;t, or Wild Pigeon; but are better meat. They have another way of killing them&mdash;They make a hut of boughs of trees, and &s;ix &s;tale Pigeons on the ground at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the hut. They plant poles for the Wild Pigeons to light on when they come a <HI>&s;alting</HI> (as they term it) which they do every morning in the &s;ea&s;on, repairing to the mar&s;hes near the &s;ea-&s;ide; then the per&s;ons in the hut pull the &s;tale Pigeon, when the birds will alight in va&s;t numbers on the poles, and great multitudes are &s;hot. Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> told me, that he killed at one &s;hot with a blunderbu&s;s, a hundred and twenty or thirty.
<PB N="326" REF="146">
Some years pa&s;t they have not been in &s;uch plenty as they u&s;ed to be. This &s;pring I &s;aw them fly one morning, as I thought in great abundance; but every body was amazed how few there were; and wondered at the rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I mu&s;t remark one very &s;ingular fact: that, notwith&s;tanding the whole people of a town go out a <HI>pigeoning,</HI> as they call it, they will not on &s;ome days kill a &s;ingle hen bird; and on the very next day, not a &s;ingle cock (and yet both &s;exes always fly we&s;terly); and when this is the ca&s;e, the people are always a&s;&s;ured that there will be great plenty of them that &s;ea&s;on. I have been at <HI>Niagara</HI> when the centinel has given the word that the Pigeons were <HI>flying;</HI> and the whole garri&s;on were ready to run over one another, &s;o eager were they to get fre&s;h meat.</Q></P>

He pur&s;ues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near his &s;tation, from the &s;malle&s;t to the large&s;t, none e&s;caping his fury; nor did I ever &s;ee any that dared to oppo&s;e him while flying, for he does not offer to attack them when &s;itting. I have &s;een one of them fix on the back of an Eagle, and per&s;ecute him &s;o, that he has turned on his back into various po&s;tures in the air, in order to get rid of him; and at la&s;t was forced to alight on the top of the next tree, from whence he dared not to move, till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him. This is the con&s;tant practice of the cock, while the hen is brooding: he &s;its on the top of a bu&s;h, or &s;mall tree, not far from her ne&s;t; near which, if any &s;mall birds approach, he drives them away; but the great ones, as Crows, Hawks, and Eagles, he won't &s;uffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him without attacking them.

In <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> this &s;pecies more fitly clames the name, it being the kind mo&s;t commonly tamed in that empire. The Whi&s;tling Swan carries its neck quite erect: the other &s;wims with it arched. This is far inferior in &s;ize.

But the mo&s;t remarkable is the &s;trange figure of the windpipe, which falls into the che&s;t, then turns back like a trumpet, and afterwards makes a &s;econd bend to join the lungs. Thus it is enabled to utter a loud and &s;hrill note.

calling: its &s;ound is, <HI>whoogh, whoogh,</HI> very loud and &s;hrill, but not di&s;|agreeable, when heard far above one's head, and modulated by the winds. The natives of <HI>Iceland</HI> compare it to the notes of a violin: in fact they hear it at the end of their long and gloomy winter, when the return of the Swans announces the return of &s;ummer: every note mu&s;t be therefore melodious which pre&s;ages the &s;peedy thaw, and the relea&s;e from their tedious confinement.</P>
<P>It is from this &s;pecies alone that the antients have given the fable of the Swan being endued with the powers of melody:<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOCAL SWAN OF THE POETS.</NOTE> embracing the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> doctrine, they made the body of this bird the man&s;ion of the &s;ouls of departed poets: and after that, attributed to the birds the &s;ame faculty of harmony which their inmates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate.

Each hovel, or, as they are called, <HI>&s;tand,</HI> is occupied by only a &s;ingle per&s;on.

down, which forms, in many of the regions, a con&s;iderable article of commerce. Mo&s;t Ducks pluck off a certain down to form its ne&s;t: the&s;e have the greate&s;t quantity, and the fine&s;t and mo&s;t ela&s;tic. It is cu&s;tomary in &s;ome places to take away the fir&s;t eggs, which oc|ca&s;ions a &s;econd laying, and a &s;econd deplumation. In <HI>Greenland</HI> they lay among the gra&s;s; in <HI>Sweden</HI> among the juniper bu&s;hes. Na|ture hath furni&s;hed them with &s;o warm a cloathing, that they brave the &s;evere&s;t winter, even of the <HI>Arctic</HI> regions. In <HI>Greenland,</HI> they are &s;een in that &s;ea&s;on by hundreds, or even thou&s;ands, in the &s;hel|tered &s;outhern bays: their breeding-places are in the mo&s;t northern. They take their young on their backs in&s;tantly to &s;ea, then dive, to &s;hake them off and teach them to &s;hift for them&s;elves. It is &s;aid, that the males are five years old before they come to their full color? that they live to a great age; and will at length grow quite grey. They are con&s;tant to their breeding-places: a pair has been ob|&s;erved to occupy the &s;ame ne&s;t twenty years. They dive to great depths for their food, which is &s;hells of all kinds. The <HI>Greenlanders</HI> kill them with darts; pur&s;ue them in their little boats; watch their cour&s;e (when they dive) by the air-bubbles; and &s;trike them when they ari&s;e wearied. The fle&s;h is valued as a food. The &s;kin of this and the next &s;pecies is the mo&s;t valuable of all, as a garment placed next to the &s;kin.</P>

wait for the&s;e birds, which are a favorite food of tho&s;e animals. They lay in <HI>June.</HI> Their eggs are green, and of the &s;ize of tho&s;e of a Hen. They are very bad ta&s;ted, and are not ea&s;ily dre&s;&s;ed; yet are &s;o acceptable to the <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans,</HI> that, at the hazard of their necks, they will climb to the mo&s;t dangerous places in &s;earch of them, and often fall and lo&s;e their lives. They catch the&s;e birds with nets, in which they are entangled in the places where they re&s;t. They are al&s;o caught in &s;nares, with a running noo&s;e hung to the end of a pole, with which the fowlers creep quietly to|wards the birds, and fling it round their necks, and draw them up the rock. The re&s;t of the flock are &s;o &s;tupid, that, notwith|&s;tanding they &s;ee the fate of their companions, they remain, &s;hak|ing their heads, on the &s;ame &s;pot, till they are all taken. The fle&s;h is exce&s;&s;ively hard and &s;inewy. The <HI>Kamt&s;chatkans</HI> cook it af|ter their fa&s;hion, by putting the bird, without plucking or gutting, into a hole filled with fire: and when it is done enough, draw off the &s;kin, and make on it a &s;avory repa&s;t.</P>
<P>HAVING gone through the cla&s;s of birds, let me remark, that there is the greate&s;t probability, that numbers of tho&s;e of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> are common to <HI>North America;</HI> and that they pa&s;s there the &s;ea&s;ons of migration; but not having actual proof of their being found on the new continent, I am obliged to place them in the&s;e appendages to each genus. The time may come, when it will be found nece&s;&s;ary to remove them into the <HI>American</HI> &s;ections. It is al&s;o likely, that num|bers may &s;eek a more &s;outhern retreat, and &s;tock <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China</HI> with their periodical flocks. I have done as much as the lights of my days have furni&s;hed me with. In &s;ome remote age, when the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> offspring will have pervaded the whole of their va&s;t conti|nent, or the de&s;cendants of the hardy <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> colonized the we&s;tern parts from their di&s;tant <HI>Kamt&s;chatka,</HI> the road in future time to new

He may, perhaps, &s;mile on the labors of the <HI>Arctic</HI> Zoologi&s;t (if by that time they are not quite ob&s;olete); and, as the animate creation never changes her cour&s;e, he may find much right; and, if he is endowed with a good heart, will candidly attribute the errors to mi&s;information, or the common in|firmity of human nature.</P>
