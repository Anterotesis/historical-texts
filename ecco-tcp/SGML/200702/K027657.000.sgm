<P>THE Editor of the following letters, is &s;o far from hav|ing ta&s;ted your Lord&s;hip's boun|ty, that he is, and perhaps ever mu&s;t remain, a &s;tranger to your per&s;on, con&s;equently, no adulation is to be apprehended from him&mdash;

He leaves it to the weak and op|pre&s;&s;ed, the widow and orphan, to proclaim your Lord&s;hip's virtues in your public capacity; that which he would celebrate is of a private nature, namely, your filial affection, which is &s;o con|&s;picuous, that he flatters him&s;elf a volume of letters, written by &s;uch a per&s;on as Mr. Sterne, on which your noble father is placed in a light &s;o truly amiable, can|not fail of engaging your Lord|&s;hip's gracious acceptance and pro|tection&mdash;In this hope, and upon this foundation, he pre&s;umes to

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE foul and infamous traf|fic, between di&s;hone&s;t book|&s;ellers and profligate &s;cribblers, which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for more than a century, has ju&s;tly brought po&s;t|humous publications under &s;u&s;pi|cion, in England, France, and more e&s;pecially in Holland: mini&s;|ters of &s;tate in every European court, great generals, royal mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, authors of e&s;tabli&s;hed repu|tation, in a word, all &s;uch as have
<PB N="2" REF="6">
had the misfortune to advance them&s;elves to eminence, have been obliged to leave behind them par|cels of letters, and other memoirs, of the mo&s;t &s;ecret and important tran&s;actions of their times, in which every fact, beyond the infor|mation of a news-paper or coffee|hou&s;e chat is &s;o faithfully mi&s;repre|&s;ented, every character delineated with &s;uch punctual deviation from the truth, and cau&s;es and effects which have no po&s;&s;ible relation, are with &s;uch amazing effrontery obtruded upon the public, that it is no wonder if men of &s;en&s;e, who
<PB N="3" REF="7">
read for in&s;truction as well as en|tertainment, generally condemn them in the lump, never, or very rarely, affording them the honour of a peru&s;al&mdash;The publi&s;her of the&s;e letters, however, has not the &s;mall|e&s;t apprehen&s;ion that any part of this well grounded cen&s;ure can fall to his &s;hare; he deals not in &s;ur|pri&s;ing events to a&s;toni&s;h the rea|der, nor in characters (one ex|cepted) which have figured on the great theatre of the world; he purpo&s;ely waves all proofs which might be drawn concerning their authenticity, from the character of
<PB N="4" REF="8">
the gentleman who had the peru|&s;al of the originals, and, with Eliza's permi&s;&s;ion, faithfully copied them at Bombay in the Ea&s;t Indies; from the te&s;timony of many re&s;pectable families in this city, who knew and loved Eliza, care&s;&s;ed and admired Mr. Sterne, and were well ac|quainted with the tender friend&s;hip between them, from many curi|anecdotes in the letters them&s;elves, any one of which were fully &s;uffi|cient to authenticate them, and &s;ubmits his reputation to the ta&s;te and di&s;cernment of the commone&s;t reader, who mu&s;t, in one view, per|ceive
<PB N="5" REF="9">
that the&s;e letters are genuine, beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of doubt&mdash;As the public is unque&s;tionably en|titled to every kind of information concerning the characters contained in the&s;e letters, which con&s;i&s;ts with the duties of humanity and a good citizen, that is, a minute acquaint|ance with tho&s;e of whom honour|able mention is made, or the pub|li&s;her is furni&s;hed with authorities to vindicate from Mr. Sterne's cen|&s;ures, which, as a man of warm temper and lively imagination, he was perhaps &s;ometimes hurried into without due reflection, he per|&s;uades
<PB N="6" REF="10">
him&s;elf that no party con|cerned will or can be offended with this publication, e&s;pecially if it is con&s;idered, that without &s;uch infor|mation it would be cold and unin|tere&s;ting; that by publi&s;hing their merits he cannot be under&s;tood to intend them any injury, and with|out it would him&s;elf fail in his duty to the public&mdash;Eliza, the lady to whom the&s;e letters are ad|dre&s;&s;ed, is Mrs. Elizabeth Draper, wife of Daniel Draper, E&s;q. coun|&s;ellor at Bombay, and at pre&s;ent chief of the Engli&s;h factory at Su|rat, a gentleman very highly re|&s;pected
<PB N="7" REF="11">
in that quarter of the globe&mdash;She is by birth an Ea&s;t Indian; but the circum&s;tance of being born in the country not proving &s;uffi|cient to defend her delicate frame again&s;t the heats of that burning climate, &s;he came to England for the recovery of her health, when by accident &s;he became acquainted with Mr. Sterne. He immedi|ately di&s;covered in her a mind &s;o congenial with his own, &s;o enligh|tened, &s;o refined, and &s;o tender, that their mutual attraction pre&s;ent|ly joined them in the clo&s;e&s;t union that purity could po&s;&s;ibly admit of;
<PB N="8" REF="12">
he loved her as his friend, and prid|ed in her as his pupil; all her con|cerns became pre&s;ently his; her health, her circum&s;tances, her re|putation, her children were his; his fortune, his time, his country were at her di&s;po&s;al, &s;o far as the &s;acrifice of all or any of the&s;e might in his opinion contribute to her real happine&s;s. If it is a&s;ked whether the glowing heat of Mr. Sterne's affection never tran&s;ported him to a flight beyond the limits of pure platoni&s;m, the publi&s;her will not take upon him ab&s;olutely to de|ny it; but this he thinks &s;o far from
<PB N="9" REF="13">
leaving any &s;tain upon that gentle|man's memory, that it perhaps in|cludes his faire&s;t encomium, &s;ince to cheri&s;h the &s;eeds of piety and cha&s;tity in a heart which the pa&s;|&s;ions are intere&s;ted to corrupt, mu&s;t be allowed to be the noble&s;t effort of a &s;oul, fraught and fortified with the ju&s;te&s;t &s;entiments of Religion and Virtue&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. James, &s;o frequently and honourably men|tioned in the&s;e letters, are the wor|thy heads of an opulent family in this city; their character is too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to need the aid of the publi&s;her in &s;ecuring the e&s;ti|mation
<PB N="10" REF="14">
they &s;o well de&s;erve and univer&s;ally po&s;&s;e&s;s, yet he cannot re&s;train one ob&s;ervation; that to have been re&s;pected and beloved by Mr. Sterne and Mrs. Draper is no incon&s;iderable te&s;timony of their merit, and &s;uch as it cannot be di&s;|plea&s;ing to them to &s;ee publi&s;hed to the world&mdash;Mi&s;s Light, now Mrs. Stratton, is on all accounts a very amiable young lady&mdash;She was acci|dentally a pa&s;&s;enger in the &s;ame &s;hip with Eliza, and in&s;tantly en|gaged her friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, but being mentioned in one of Mrs. Draper's letters to Mr. Sterne, in
<PB N="11" REF="15">
&s;omewhat of a comparative manner with her&s;elf, his partiality for her, as &s;he mode&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed it, took the alarm, and betrayed him into &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, the coar&s;ene&s;s of which cannot be excu&s;ed. Mrs. Draper declares, that this lady was entirely unknown to him, and in|finitely &s;uperior to his idea of her: &s;he has been lately married to George Stratton, E&s;q. Coun&s;ellor at Madra&s;s&mdash;The manner in which Mr. Sterne's acquaintance with the celebrated Lord Bathur&s;t, the friend and companion of Addi&s;on, Swift, Pope, Steele, and all the fine&s;t wits of the la&s;t age, commenced,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
cannot fail to attract the attention of the curious reader: here that great man is &s;ocial and unre&s;erved, un&s;hackled with that &s;edulity in &s;upporting a feigned character which expo&s;es mo&s;t of his rank to the contempt of wi&s;e men, and the ri|dicule of their valets de chambre; here he appears the &s;ame as in his hours of fe&s;tivity and happine&s;s with Swift and Addi&s;on, &s;uperior to forms and ceremonies, and, in his eighty-fifth year, abounding in wit, vivacity and humanity: me|thinks the plea&s;ure of &s;uch a gen|tleman's acquaintance re&s;embles that of conver&s;ing with &s;uperior
<PB N="13" REF="17">
beings; but it is not fit to dwell longer on this plea&s;ing topic, lea&s;t it &s;hould anticipate the reader's plea&s;ure in peru&s;ing the letter it&s;elf: one remark however it &s;ugge&s;ts, which may be u&s;eful to old men in general, to wit, that it appears, by his lord&s;hip's example, the &s;our contracted &s;pirit ob&s;ervable in old age, is not &s;pecifically an effect of years, altho' they are commonly pleaded in it's excu&s;e. Old men would therefore do well to correct this odious quality in them&s;elves; or, if that mu&s;t not be, to invent a better apology for it&mdash;It is very much to be lamented, that Eliza's
<PB N="14" REF="18">
mode&s;ty was invincible to all the publi&s;her's endeavours to obtain her an&s;wers to the&s;e letters: her wit, penetration and judgment, her hap|pine&s;s in the epi&s;tolary &s;tile, &s;o rap|turou&s;ly commended by Mr. Sterne, could not fail to furni&s;h a rich en|tertainment for the public. The publi&s;her could not help telling her, that he wi&s;hed to God &s;he really was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that vanity with which &s;he was charged; to which &s;he replied, that &s;he was &s;o far from acquitting her&s;elf of vanity, that &s;he &s;u&s;pected that to be the cau&s;e why &s;he could not prevail on her|&s;elf to &s;ubmit her letters to the
<PB N="15" REF="19">
public eye; for altho' Mr. Sterne was partial to every thing of her's, &s;he could not hope that the world would be &s;o too: with this an&s;wer he was oblig'd to be contented; yet cannot reflect without deep con|cern, that this elegant accompli&s;h|ment, &s;o peculiarly adapted to the refined and delicate under&s;tandings of ladies, &s;hould be yet &s;o rare that we can boa&s;t of only one lady Wortley Montague among us, and that Eliza in particular could not be prevailed on to follow the example of that admired Lady&mdash;The reader will remark, that the&s;e letters have various &s;ignatures, &s;ometimes he
<PB N="16" REF="20">
&s;igns Sterne, &s;ometimes Yorick, and to one or two he &s;igns her Bramin; altho' it is pretty gene|rally known who the Bramins are, yet lea&s;t any body &s;hould be at a lo&s;s, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the principal ca&s;t or tribe a|mong the idolatrous Indians are the Bramins, and out of the chief cla&s;s of this ca&s;t come the prie&s;ts, &s;o fa|mous for their au&s;terities, and the &s;hocking torments, and frequently death, they voluntarily expo&s;e them|&s;elves to, on a religious account: now, as Mr. Sterne was a clergy|man, and Eliza an Indian by birth, it was cu&s;tomary with her to call
<PB N="17" REF="21">
him her Bramin, which he accord|ingly, in his plea&s;ant moods, u&s;es as a &s;ignature&mdash;It remains only, to take &s;ome little notice of the fa|mily marked with a&s;teri&s;ks, on whom Mr. Sterne has thought pro|per to &s;hed the bittere&s;t gall of his pen; it is however evident, even from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the letters them&s;elves, that Mrs. Draper could not be ea&s;ily prevailed on to &s;ee this family in the &s;ame odious light in which they appeared to her, perhaps over zealous, friend. He, in the heat, or I may &s;ay, hurry of his affection, might have accepted &s;u&s;picious cir|cum&s;tances as real evidences of
<PB N="18" REF="22">
guilt, or li&s;tened too unguardedly to the in&s;inuations of their enemies: be that as it may, as the publi&s;her is not furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient au|thorities to exculpate them, he chu&s;es to drop the ungrateful &s;ub|ject, heartily wi&s;hing, that this family may not only be innocent of the &s;hocking treachery with which they are charged, but may be able to make their innocence appear clearly to the world, otherwi&s;e that no per&s;on may be indu&s;trious enough to di&s;cover and make known their name.</P>

<P>I Got thy letter la&s;t night, Eliza, on my return from Lord Bathur&s;t's, where I din'd; and where I was heard (as I talk'd of thee for an hour with|out intermi&s;&s;ion) with &s;o much plea|&s;ure and attention, that the good old Lord toa&s;ted your health three &s;everal times; and tho' he is now in his eighty-fifth year, &s;ays he hopes to live long enough to be introduced as a friend, to my fair Indian di&s;ciple; and to &s;ee her eclip&s;e all other Na|bobe&s;&s;es as much in wealth, as &s;he already does in exterior and (what is far better) in interior merit&mdash;I hope &s;o too.</P>

This nobleman is an old friend of mine. You know he was always the protector of men of wit and genius, and had tho&s;e of the la&s;t century, Addi&s;on, Steele, Pope, Swift, Prior, &amp;c. &amp;c. always at his table.&mdash;</P>
<P>The manner in which his notice of me began, was &s;ingular, as it was polite: he came up to me one day, as I was at the Prince&s;s of Wales's court&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I want to know you, Mr. S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ne; but it is fit you &s;hould al&s;o know who it is that wi&s;hes this plea|&s;ure. You have heard, continued he, of an old Lord Bathur&s;t, of whom your Pope's and Swift's have &s;ung and &s;poken &s;o much: I have liv'd my life
<PB N="7" REF="29">
with genius's of that ca&s;t, but have &s;urviv'd them; and de&s;pairing ever to find their equals, 'tis &s;ome years &s;ince I clos'd my accounts, and &s;hut up my books, with thoughts of never opening them again: But you have kindled a de&s;ire in me to open them once more before I die, which I now do&mdash;&s;o go home and dine with me."</Q></P>
<P>This nobleman, I &s;ay, is a prodigy! for at eighty five he has all the wit and promptne&s;s of a man of thirty&mdash;a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed, and a power to plea&s;e others, beyond what|ever I knew; added to which, a man of learning, courte&s;y and feeling.&mdash;</P>

He heard me talk of thee, Eliza, with uncommon &s;atisfaction, for there was only a third per&s;on, and of &s;en&s;i|bility, with us&mdash;and a mo&s;t &s;entimen|tal afternoon, till nine o'clock, have we pa&s;s'd! But thou, Eliza, was the &s;tar that conducted and enlighten'd the di&s;cour&s;e! and when I talk'd not of thee, &s;till did&s;t thou fill my mind, and warm ev'ry thought I utter'd! for I am not a&s;ham'd to acknowledge, I greatly mi&s;s thee&mdash;be&s;t of all good girls! the &s;ufferings I have &s;u&s;tain'd all night on account of thine, Eliza, are beyond my power of words&mdash;a&s;|&s;uredly does heaven give &s;trength pro|portion'd to the weight he lays upon us&mdash;Thou ha&s;t been bow'd down, my

And &s;o thou ha&s;t fix'd thy Bramin's portrait over thy writing de&s;k, and will con&s;ult it in all doubts and diffi|culties; grateful good girl! Yorick &s;miles contentedly over all thou do&s;t, his picture does not do ju&s;tice to his own complacency&mdash;</P>
<P>Thy &s;weet little plan and di&s;tribu|tion of thy time, how worthy of thee!</P>
<P>Indeed, Eliza, thou leave&s;t one no|thing to direct thee in, thou leave&s;t me nothing to require, nothing to a&s;k, but a continuance of that conduct which won my e&s;teem, and has made me thy friend for ever.</P>

May the ro&s;es come quick back to thy check, and the rubies to thy lips! but tru&s;t my declaration, Eliza, that thy hu&s;band (if he is the good feeling man I wi&s;h him) will pre&s;s thee to him with more hone&s;t warmth and affec|tion, and ki&s;s thy pale poor dejected face with more tran&s;port, than he wou'd be able to do in the be&s;t bloom of all thy beauty&mdash;and &s;o he ought.&mdash;I pity him.&mdash;He mu&s;t have &s;trange feelings, if he knows not the value of &s;uch a creature as thou art&mdash;</P>

<P>How can&s;t thou make apologies for thy la&s;t letter! 'tis mo&s;t delicious to me, for the very rea&s;ons you ex|cu&s;e it&mdash;</P>
<P>Write to me, my child, only &s;uch, let them &s;peak the ea&s;y chearfulne&s;s of a heart that opens it&s;elf any how, and every how, to a man you ought to e&s;|teem and tru&s;t&mdash;</P>

<PB N="57" REF="81">
weakne&s;s at &s;ix, and awoke with the bo&s;om of my &s;hirt &s;teep'd in tears&mdash;</P>
<P>I dream'd I was &s;itting under the canopy of Indolence, and that thou cam'&s;t into the room with a &s;haul in thy hand, and told me, <Q REND="inline">"my &s;pirit had flown to thee to the Downs with tidings of my fate, and that you was come to admini&s;ter what con&s;olation filial affection could be&s;tow, and to receive my parting breath and ble&s;s|ings,"</Q> with that you folded the &s;haul about my wai&s;t, and, kneeling, &s;uppli|cated my attention.</P>
<P>I awoke, but in what a fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">! Oh! my God! but <Q REND="inline">"Thou w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t re|member

my tears, and put them all into thy bottle"</Q>&mdash;Dear girl, I &s;ee thee, thou art for ever pre&s;ent to my fancy, embracing my feeble knees, and rai&s;|ing thy fine eyes to bid me be of comfort&mdash;</P>
<P>And when I talk to Lydia, the words of E&s;au, as utter'd by thee, perpetu|ally ring in my ears.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s me even al&s;o, my fa|ther."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ings attend thee, thou child of my heart&mdash;My bleeding is quite &s;topp'd, and I feel the principle of life
<PB N="59" REF="83">
&s;trong within me&mdash;&s;o be not alarm'd, Eliza, I know I &s;hall do well&mdash;</P>
<P>I have eat my breakfa&s;t with hun|ger, and I write to thee with a plea|&s;ure ari&s;ing from that prophetic im|pre&s;&s;ion in my imagination.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That all will terminate to our hearts content"</Q>&mdash;Comfort thy&s;elf eter|nally with this per&s;ua&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"That the be&s;t of beings (as thou &s;weetly ha&s;t expre&s;s'd it) could not by a com|bination of accidents, produce &s;uch a chain of events, merely to be the &s;ource of mi&s;ery to the leading per&s;on engag'd in them"</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="84">
The ob&s;ervation was very applica|ble, very good, and very elegantly expre&s;s'd&mdash;I wi&s;h my memory did ju&s;tice to the wording of it&mdash;</P>
<P>Who taught you the art of writing &s;o &s;weetly, Eliza? You ab&s;olutely have exalted it to a &s;cience&mdash;When I am in want of ready ca&s;h, and ill health will permit my genius to exert it&s;elf, I &s;hall print your letters, as <HI>Fini&s;h'd E&s;&s;ays</HI> by an <HI>unfortunate Indian Lady!</HI> The &s;tyle is new, and would almo&s;t be a &s;ufficient recommendation for their &s;elling well, without merit; but their &s;en&s;e, natural ea&s;e, and &s;pirit, is not to be equall'd, I believe, in this &s;ec|tion of the globe; nor, I'll an&s;wer
<PB N="61" REF="85">
for it, by any of your country women in yours&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;hew'd your letter to Mrs. B. and to half the literati in town: you &s;hall not be angry with me for it, be|cau&s;e I meant to do you honour by it&mdash;</P>
<P>You cannot imagine how many ad|mirers your epi&s;tolary productions have gain'd you, that never view'd your external merits&mdash;</P>
<P>I only wonder where thou could&s;t acquire thy graces, thy goodne&s;s, thy accompli&s;hments! &s;o connected! &s;o educated! Nature has &s;urely &s;tudy'd
<PB N="62" REF="86">
to make thee her peculiar care, for thou art (and not in my eyes alone) the be&s;t and faire&s;t of all her works&mdash;and &s;o this is the la&s;t letter thou art to receive from me, becau&s;e the Earl of Chatham (I read in the papers) is got to the Downs, and the wind (I find) is fair&mdash;if &s;o, ble&s;&s;ed woman, take my la&s;t, la&s;t farewell! cheri&s;h the remembrance of me, think how I e&s;teem, nay, how affectionately I love thee, and what a price I &s;et upon thee. Adieu, adieu; and with my adieu, let me give thee one &s;hort rule of conduct, that thou ha&s;t heard from my lips in a thou&s;and forms, but I concenter it in one word,</P>
<P>&mdash;Reverence Thy&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="87">
Adieu once more, Eliza, may no an|gui&s;h of heart plant a wrinkle upon thy face, till I behold it again; may no doubt or mi&s;givings di&s;turb the &s;erenity of thy mind, or awaken a painful thought about thy children, for they are Yorick's, and Yorick is thy friend for ever&mdash;</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu, adieu, adieu&mdash; <POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P.S.</HI> Remember that <Q REND="inline">"Hope &s;hortens all journies, by &s;weetning them;"</Q> &s;o &s;ing my little &s;tanza on the &s;ubject, with the devotion of an hymn, every morning thou ari&s;e&s;t, and thou wilt eat thy breakfa&s;t with more comfort for it&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings, re&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="88">
and Hygeia go with thee; may'&s;t thou &s;oon return in peace and affluence to illumine my night. I am, and &s;hall be the la&s;t to deplore thy lo&s;s, and will be the fir&s;t to congratulate, and hail thy return&mdash;</P>
</POSTSCRIPT> Fare thee well&mdash;</CLOSER>
