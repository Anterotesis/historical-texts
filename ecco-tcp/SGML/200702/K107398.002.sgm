<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT to the READER concerning the fol|lowing
LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Letter was writ by me about &s;ixteen Years ago. But that the Reader may enter into it with the great|er Ea&s;e, and be the better entertain'd with it, it will be convenient to lay before him the Occa&s;ion upon which it was writ. It was towards the end of the la&s;t Century that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> publi&s;h'd a Book call'd, <HI>A &s;hort View of the Prophane&s;s and Immorality of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Stage;</HI> in which Book, tho' there were &s;everal Things true in particular, yet the Author was manife&s;tly &s;o unfair an Ad|ver&s;ary in general, that the latter End of the Book very gro&s;sly contradicted the begin|ning of it, and endeavour'd to decry even a Regulated Stage, which the Author at the beginning of the Book had acknowled'd u&s;e|ful. About four or five Years after that, as near as I can remember, Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> took occa&s;ion from the great Storm, which hap|pen'd about that Time, to renew his Attack
<PB N="226" REF="3">
upon the Stage, in a little Pamphlet call'd, <HI>A Di&s;&s;ua&s;ive from the Play-Hou&s;e, writ|ten by way of Letter to a Per&s;on of Qua|lity.</HI> Which Pamphlet, upon the Fa&s;t Day that was order'd to be kept by publick Au|thority immediately after that Tempe&s;t, was given to People <HI>gratis</HI> as they came out of the Churches. The De&s;ign of it was to make the great Storm a Judgment upon the Na|tion for the Enormities of our Theatres. The Hypocri&s;ie was here &s;o flagrant and &s;o ab&s;urd and extravagant, that it rais'd ei|ther the Indignation or Mirth of all di&s;|cerning Men of Integrity. At the &s;ame time it had a wonderful Influence upon the Weak and the Hypocrites; and there was a great Outcry again&s;t the Stage; &s;o great a one, that there was a warm Report about the Town, that it had been twice debated in Council, whether the Theatres &s;hould be &s;hut up or continued. Then it was that I could bear no longer, but as I had before de|fended a regulated Stage again&s;t the Author's Attack in his <HI>Short View,</HI> I was re&s;olved to expo&s;e the Hypocri&s;ie, the Extravagance and the Sophi&s;try of his <HI>Di&s;&s;ua&s;ive.</HI> This Re&s;olution produced the following Letter, which I call'd the <HI>Per&s;on of Quality's An|&s;wer to Mr.</HI> Collier<HI>'s Letter;</HI> and which was intended to con&s;i&s;t of a Mixture of Rea|&s;on and Raillery, and which was mo&s;t agreeably receiv'd by &s;ome of the be&s;t Judges who were
<PB N="227" REF="4">
then in <HI>England,</HI> and particularly by the late Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the late Earl of <HI>Halifax,</HI> and the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Lan&s;down.</HI> As this Letter has been &s;o long out of Print, that it is as &s;carce as any Manu&s;cript of which there is but one Copy, I thought it might be as new and as entertaining to mo&s;t of its Readers as if it had been never pub|li&s;h'd. There remains one thing more with which I mu&s;t acquaint the Reader, and that is, that I, who have all my Life-time ab|horr'd Hypocri&s;ie, and &s;corn'd to pa&s;s for a|ny thing which I am not, tho' in the Title Page I call the Letter <HI>the Per&s;on of Qua|lity's An&s;wer,</HI> have yet taken care in the Body of the Letter to acquaint the Reader, that I am only a private Gentleman. But I make no doubt but that I am a much more con&s;iderable Per&s;on than he to whom Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Letter was writ, who perhaps was no Body.</P>

<HEAD>THE Per&s;on of Quality's ANSWER TO Mr. COLLIER'S LETTER:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing a Defence of a Regulated Stage.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<DATELINE>Lincolns-Inn-Fields, 
<DATE>Jan. the 1&s;t.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>Dear Doctor,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THIS Afternoon, I receiv'd your Edi|fying, Evangelical <HI>Di&s;&s;ua&s;ive;</HI> for which, What Thanks can I return you? What Recompence can be &s;ufficient? May he, for who&s;e &s;ake you did it, amply re|ward you.</P>
<P><HI>I had conceived indeed a Zealous concern at the Di&s;orders of the Play-Hou&s;e, I la|mented its having &s;o much the a&s;cendant of the Town, and the Countenance of Figure and Fortune. And I too ju&s;tly pre&s;aged that the&s;e Nur&s;eries of Licer&s;e and Athei&s;m, e&s;|pecially</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="6">
<HI>that in our Neighbourhood, wou'd, if unre&s;train'd, prove fatal to the Nation; make us ripe for De&s;truction, and pull down &s;ome terrible Vengeance on our Heads;</HI> no le&s;s than Popery, or Arbitrary Power at the lea&s;t; and, dear Doctor, what a Day, and what a Sight wou'd that be to you and me?</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I re&s;olved that, in my Family, Reformation and the Year &s;hould begin together; and for that Rea&s;on I cal|led them together as &s;oon as they had dined to-day, determining to read a long and a &s;olemn Lecture out of your <HI>Short View</HI> to them; but a &s;trange Fatality had happen'd; for &s;ome audacious Rats had &s;o prophane|ly gnawn it, that it was no longer legible; a Detachment, in my Con&s;cience, of Play-Hou&s;e Vermin, whom the Devil had en|ter'd into for that purpo&s;e, at his Congregati|on in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Thus bilk'd of my Homily, I thought I mu&s;t, to my great Grief, have been forced to di&s;mi&s;s my Flock. For I perceived they were grown <HI>frightfully Nice and Impatient, and were re&s;olved to be cur'd extempore or not at all.</HI></P>
<P>But then it was that in an au&s;picious Mo|ment arriv'd your &s;hort, but Divine <HI>Di&s;|&s;ua&s;ive.</HI> I read it over as it were in a Breath, while they all the while &s;tood ga|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to entertain it. But the la&s;t incom|parable
<PB N="230" REF="7">
Paragraph but one, I pronounced with a more emphatical Voice; laid before them with all the Energy of my Lungs, <HI>the &s;ad In&s;tance of God's Judgment in the ter|rible Tempe&s;t when we were almo&s;t &s;wept into Chaos,</HI> when Nature <HI>&s;eem'd to be in her la&s;t Agony, and the World &s;eem'd ready to expire.</HI> And what occa&s;ion, &s;aid I to my gaping Audience, to have Recour&s;e to Tra|gedies, when tho&s;e Rants, that Fu&s;tian, and that Bomba&s;t, with which deluded Mortals are now-a-days &s;o tickled, are en|gagingly in&s;erted into our very <HI>Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives?</HI></P>
<P>And here, Doctor, I made two Remarks to them, upon the Judgment of the late dreadful Tempe&s;t. For fir&s;t, &s;aid I, the Outcries of the Play-Hou&s;e Practices are &s;o aggravating, &s;o horrible, that the Divine Vengeance which they brought down up|on us, has invol'd the very Innocent. Not only the poor Inhabitants of <HI>Cologn,</HI> but the very <HI>Hamburgers</HI> and <HI>Dantzickers,</HI> and all the People of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> have &s;uffer'd for the Enormities of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatres; tho' I believe in my Con&s;cience they never &s;o much as heard of a Play, and know no more the Difference between a Tragedy and Comedy, than they do the Di&s;tance between the Earth and <HI>Saturn;</HI> &s;o that, &s;aid I, you may ob&s;erve from hence, 'tis not e|nough to keep away from the&s;e lewd En|tertainments; but you mu&s;t endeavour with
<PB N="231" REF="8">
all your Might to &s;uppre&s;s the Conventicles of Satan.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Ob&s;ervation that I made was this, that we have rea&s;on to be thankful to Heaven, for forbearing us &s;o long. For if the late dreadful Judgment had happen'd in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when the Play-Hou&s;es were licentious in all their Impunity; when Reformation was &s;o far from being thought of, that the very Name was de&s;pi&s;ed and laught at, what mu&s;t the di&s;mal Con&s;equence not have been? Then we &s;hould certainly have been &s;wal|low'd up, &s;ince the <HI>Judgment</HI> was &s;o terri|ble even the other Day, after a five Years Reformation?</P>
<P>What rea&s;on have we to be thankful, that we live in an Age in which Light is come into the World. For in what <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Darkne&s;s have we liv'd hitherto? And what a poor Reformation was that which was carried on in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, in Compari&s;on of that which you are glo|riou&s;ly projecting? For with that former Reformation the Play-Hou&s;e began, grew up, and &s;pread, and flouri&s;h'd. What a &s;hadow of a Reformation was that? 'Tis true, Popery was driven out, and whol|&s;ome Laws were enacted to &s;ecure the Rights of the People. But what &s;ignified all that, when the Play-Hou&s;e was encou|rag'd? For tho', as you learnedly ob&s;erve,
<PB N="232" REF="9">
Play-Hou&s;es, in the Reign of that great Queen, were not permitted to be erected in the Liberties of the City, yet in the Suburbs they were not only permitted but encourag'd with a Vengeance; and by whom encourag'd? Why, not only by the People, but by the Court, nay, by the Council, yes, by tho&s;e poor deluded Wretches <HI>Cecil</HI> and <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> who believ'd it to be the Bu|&s;ine&s;s, for&s;ooth, of wi&s;e States-Men, to provide hone&s;t and rea&s;onable Diver&s;ions for the People; and at the &s;ame time were &s;o infatuated, &s;o intoxicated, as to believe the Entertainments of the Theatre not on|ly to be hone&s;t and rea&s;onable, but the on|ly hone&s;t and rea&s;onable Diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Nay, the poor mi&s;taken Queen her &s;elf encouraged Play-Hou&s;es to that degree, that &s;he not only commanded <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to write the Comedy of the <HI>Merry Wives,</HI> and to write it in ten Days time; &s;o eager was &s;he for the wicked Diver&s;ion; but ev'n with that Hand that wielded the Scepter de&s;cended poorly to tran&s;late a Play that was writ by a <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet. She had read, it &s;eems, of &s;ome great Men among the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had &s;hewn the way; as <HI>Ju|lius Cae&s;ar</HI> had writ <HI>Adra&s;tus; Augu&s;tus, A|jax; Gracchus, Thie&s;tes;</HI> and <HI>Mecaenas, Octa|via;</HI> and &s;he wanted Judgment, alas, poor Woman, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Obli|gations of a Heathen and a Chri&s;tian. 'Tis
<PB N="233" REF="10">
true &s;he was wi&s;e enough in &s;ome things, &s;he kept out Popery and Arbitrary Power, &s;he defended us from <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> by the meer Force of her Prudence. But what &s;ignified that, you know, Doctor, when &s;he encourag'd the Play-Hou&s;es, and wanted Fore-&s;ight in that particular, to pre&s;age that the&s;e Nur&s;eries of Vice and Athei&s;m wou'd prove fatal to the Nation?</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;ome Fools about her had told her, that at a time when Taxes were fre|quent and grievous, &s;ome hone&s;t Diver&s;i|ons would comfort the People, but that it would be unrea&s;onable to deprive them at once of their Money, and of their Plea&s;ure too; this &s;he had been told, and &s;he like an ea&s;ie Woman believ'd it. But what a|mazes me mo&s;t is this, Doctor, that not only that Queen and her Council encou|raged Plays, but not &s;o much as one of the famous Prelates in her time &s;aid &s;o much as a word again&s;t them. 'Tis true, the States-Men defended us again&s;t <HI>Spain</HI> very vigo|rou&s;ly, and very effectually, and &s;o did the Church-Men again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> See; but alas their poor and narrow Spirits content|ed them&s;elves with that. But not &s;o much as one word was &s;aid again&s;t the Abomina|tions of the Play-Hou&s;es. There were Reformers indeed! Were they &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s that they wanted Di&s;cernment to &s;ee the <HI>flaming and Outragious Wickedne&s;s</HI> of them?
<PB N="234" REF="11">
Or &s;o very wicked that they wanted Zeal to di&s;charge their Duty in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them? Ah my dear Doctor, had you but liv'd in tho&s;e Times, you wou'd have taught that Queen her Le&s;&s;on, in loyal Libels have told her her Duty, affronted her Authority, de|fam'd her Servants, and boldly have told her that &s;he countenanc'd them only to de|bauch her People. You would have open'd the Eyes of tho&s;e Fools, who believ'd <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> to be In&s;tructive as well as Innocent. You would have extracted more <HI>Smutt</HI> from his Comedies, than a Chimney does from Seacoal. And what Prophane&s;s and Bla&s;|phemy had you not found in his Tra|gedies? You would have &s;atisfy'd both Queen, and Council, and Clergy too, that their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;uppre&s;s the Play-Hou&s;es, and to let <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> alone. That the Danger that they were in was not from <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth; but from Tyrants who had been many a Year defunct, from <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Macbeth;</HI> you would have <HI>pre&s;aged</HI> the Storm that the latter would have pull'd down upon the Nation, a hundred Years after 'twas writ. You had then been <HI>Hi|&s;trio Ma&s;tix</HI> the fir&s;t, whereas you are now but the &s;econd of that glorious Name; and then had old bungling <HI>Pryn</HI> been cropt for pre&s;uming to copy you. Thus, my dear Doctor, we have rea&s;on to believe what
<PB N="235" REF="12">
you would have done, from what we be|hold you do. For tho' Popery and Slave|ry are at our Doors, and each Moment are ru&s;hing in upon us; and nothing but the Wi&s;dom of one Woman &s;tands between us and them, yet you &s;till retain your com|mendable Pa&s;&s;ive Principle, appear as un|concern'd as if you had &s;worn to be a Foe to neither, are found to be as little alarm'd for theChurch, as if you had thrown off itsCau&s;e, as you have ca&s;t off its Habit; and in&s;tead of crying out Slavery, Popery, do nothing but cry out the Play-Hou&s;e, the Play-Hou&s;e, with as much Fury as if you were afraid it &s;hould contribute to the keeping them out.</P>
<P>But my dear Doctor, by the leave of your Mode&s;ty, I mu&s;t exalt your Glory to a higher Pitch. When Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> died, King <HI>James</HI> &s;ucceeded her; and a|mong the eminent Reformers of his Reign there was no talk of the Stage. Nay, on the contrary, to their Shame be it &s;poken, that King and his Court appear'd to be in|finitely delighted with Plays. And in his Vi&s;its to the two Univer&s;ities, Plays were the chief of his Entertainment. But what would we have, Doctor? as the Education is, &s;o is the Youth. And he had been tu|tor'd by old <HI>George,</HI> a notorious Refor|mer, but a notorious Playwright. For the Sot believ'd, it &s;eems, that the <HI>Drama</HI> could contribute to the Reformation of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="13">
To King <HI>James</HI> &s;ucceeded King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t; and then aro&s;e another famous Reformer, <HI>John Milton</HI> by Name, who not only left a Tragedy behind him, the Story of which he impiou&s;ly borrow'd from the Bible, written, to leave him without Excu&s;e, in his mature, nay declining Years, but has left a fine Encomium on <HI>Shake&s;pear;</HI> has &s;hewn an extraordinary E&s;teem for <HI>John&s;on;</HI> and among all the Things that he thought fit to reform, &s;o far had Pre|judice laid hold of his Under&s;tanding, it ne|ver &s;o much as came into his Head that the Stage was one of them.</P>
<P>But then about that time, Doctor, there aro&s;e a Reformer indeed, Brother <HI>Pryn</HI> of Illu&s;trious Memory; a Per&s;on indeed of an <HI>amazing</HI> Boldne&s;s. For to the Fervency of his furious Spirit, Ruine and Reforma|tion were all one. With the&s;e Zealot's Thoughts he &s;et about reforming the Church as well as the Stage; and by preparing the Downfal of one made way for the Ruine of the other. 'Tis true, he lo&s;t &s;ome part of him&s;elf in the Cau&s;e. But happy the Ears that were &s;o lo&s;t! How much hap|pier than tho&s;e that &s;tand pricking up dai|ly at the Ribaldry of our Modern Comedies? I know, dear Doctor, under the Ro&s;e, that you have the &s;ame De&s;ign, and that you will never leave off writing as long as there is left either a Prelate or Poet in <HI>England;</HI>
<PB N="237" REF="14">
or if you do conde&s;cend to admit of Bi|&s;hops, you will at lea&s;t &s;uffer no &s;uch Bi&s;hops as have a Tang of the Stage; I mean no &s;wear|ing, prophane Bi&s;hops, but &s;uch who&s;e meek and Chri&s;tian Communication is on|ly Yea and Nay.</P>
<P>As you have the &s;ame noble De&s;ign, may you find better Fortune, as you well de|&s;erve. For he, my dear Doctor, was but a Type of your more excellent &s;elf, tho'in|deed an illu&s;trious Type. And he but an|ticipated in a cold and a gloomy way, the very things that Fate had de&s;igned to be &s;aid with Fire and Flame by you. He in|deed overthrew but for a time the Church and Stage together. But may you with a more propitious Fate&mdash;. But hold!&mdash;No Man, you know, is able to tell into who&s;e Hands a Letter may fall.</P>
<P>Thus, Doctor, the ble&s;&s;ed Work of Re|formation went on; and down went the Bi&s;hops and the Stage together; but after they had lain for &s;ome time in the Du&s;t, were re&s;tor'd together, and with them the bani&s;h'd King.</P>
<P>And there are not People wanting, who believe, that the re&s;toring the Stage, was one of the Motives to the re&s;toring the ba|ni&s;h'd King; for, &s;ay they, the People of <HI>England</HI> were at la&s;t grown weary of a na|&s;ty, gloomy, &s;ullen, Fanatical Government, and began to long for their Plea&s;ures. How,
<PB N="238" REF="15">
my dear Doctor? The re&s;toring the Stage was one of the Motives to re&s;toring the bani&s;h'd King? Ah, my dear Doctor, if you had but flouri&s;h'd in that au&s;picious Juncture! How happy would you have e&s;teem'd your &s;elf to have been the In&s;tru|ment of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Stage, only on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it re&s;tor'd with &s;uch a glo|rious Attendant?</P>
<P>Well! the King, the Bi&s;hops, and the Stage were re&s;tored together, and a long time flouri&s;h'd together, without any talk of reforming the Play-Hou&s;es, much le&s;s of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them. For the merry Mi|ni&s;ters of that happy Prince laugh'd at a Reformation. And even the foremo&s;t Mini&s;ters of the Church at that time, among whom were certainly &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men that the Chri&s;tian World has produc'd, appear'd by no means to be &s;o terribly a|larm'd at the Entertainments of the Stage.</P>
<P>You your &s;elf, I remember, Doctor, were then at Years of Di&s;cretion; and yet with pa&s;&s;ive Ears and Tongue, endur'd the Filth of <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> Wells, the Bawdy of the <HI>Soldier's Fortune,</HI> and the Bea&s;tline&s;s of <HI>Limber-Ham.</HI> But the time of your Prophetick Mi&s;&s;ion it &s;eems was not yet come, or perhaps you thought it improper to fall out with the Play-Hou&s;es, before you had fallen out with the Government. But you have at la&s;t, to the wonder of the World, declar'd your
<PB N="239" REF="16">
&s;elf, and we may &s;ay of you what <HI>Lucreti|us</HI> &s;aid of his ador'd <HI>Epicurus,</HI> Pardon the Compari&s;on, I be&s;eech you, Doctor,<Q> 
<L>That you in Wit &s;urpa&s;s Mankind as far,</L>
<L>As does the Midday Sun, the Midnight Star.</L></Q></P>
<P>For what in the beginning of the Refor|mation was never &s;een, neither by <HI>Jewell,</HI> nor <HI>Ridley,</HI> nor <HI>Cranmer,</HI> nor <HI>Latimer;</HI> nor was afterwards hardly &s;o much as thought of by the judicious, the penetrating, the &s;agacious <HI>Hooker;</HI> nor what in this lat|ter end of it, (as under the Ro&s;e we &s;weetly hope Doctor) has not been found out nei|ther by <HI>Wilkins</HI> nor <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> who have &s;hown &s;o much Under&s;tanding and &s;o much Judgment; as well by the Force of their invincible Arguments, as of their clear, cha&s;te, noble, and ma&s;culine Styles; What none of the&s;e have been able to find, you have plainly convinc'd the World of; that the Play-Hou&s;e would bring all to Ruin; O Miracle of boundle&s;s Sagacity! O Pro|digy of Penetration! The late Archbi&s;hop was certainly a Man of as undoubted Pro|bity, of as much Integrity, as ever liv'd in the World; nor was his Zeal and his Bold|ne&s;s in the Cau&s;e of Virtue le&s;s; witne&s;s that noble, that intrepid Spirit, with which he appear'd again&s;t Popery, even in the mo&s;t dangerous times, when the Je&s;uits us'd
<PB N="240" REF="17">
&s;harp deci&s;ive Arguments, and made no|thing of cutting a Man's Throat out of Zeal to confute his Doctrine; the late Archbi&s;hop, I &s;ay, Doctor, who had &s;o much Boldne&s;s, as well as Zeal and Inte|grity, and who in the late Reign had &s;o much Power; never &s;aw this dreadful Dan|ger from Plays, which you have &s;o plain|ly di&s;cover'd. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;omething in the Eleventh Volume of his Sermons again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>Plays,</HI> which I had not &s;een when this was writ: but Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has prevaricated vilely in the Quotation.</NOTE> For if he had &s;een it, he would have prevail'd upon the late Queen to &s;uppre&s;s them. He either fore&s;aw none of this Danger, or if he did, the good mi|&s;taken Man thought there would be more in going about to prevent it. An infallible Sign that he wanted your Fore-&s;ight and your Sagacity. He look'd upon him&s;elf to be indi&s;pen&s;ably bound in a double Re&s;pect to reform the Corruptions of the times. For he was both Head of the Church, and fir&s;t Coun&s;ellor of State. And no Man knew better than that judicious Prelate, that Corruptions of Manners are mo&s;t per|nicious both to Church and State. And no Man ever di&s;cover'd more Zeal for the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment both in Church and State. And yet poor Man, with all his Un|der&s;tanding, and all his Zeal, he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o far deluded in this Particular, that he never
<PB N="241" REF="18">
medled with the&s;e Nur&s;eries of Licen&s;e and Athei&s;m. As many admirable Sermons as he left behind him, again&s;t the Vices and the Errors of the Times; I believe you will hardly find that he has mentioned the Play-Hou&s;es with Bitterne&s;s in them all. He left that part of Reformation for your &s;ublimer Prudence, and more Heroick Charity. Indeed the Concern that he had him&s;elf both in Church and State was &s;o apparent, that perhaps he might fear that a violent Endeavour to reform our Theatres in him might look like Intere&s;t; and might perhaps imagine that the Work would be kindlier received, if it were carried on by one who cared not a Farthing either for Church or State.</P>
<P>And here, Doctor, give me leave to ad|mire the Glory, or to &s;peak in your own Diviner Language, the <HI>Meridian Blaze of your my&s;terious Charity. 'Tis of an ama|zing Size and Brightne&s;s,</HI> and our weak Eyes are dazled at it.

wonderful. When I con&s;ider that all who are engaged by Duty, are either dumb or very cold in the matter, while you are declaiming with &s;o much Fervour, with &s;o much Zeal, again&s;t the Di&s;orders of our Theatres, you who have nothing to do with the Matter; I can never &s;ufficient|ly admire the Exce&s;s of your Zeal, which is too high and too heavenly to be compre|hended by a Mortal.</P>
<P>I can only &s;ay, that 'tis a thou&s;and pities 'tis confin'd to &s;o narrow a Sphere. But, alas! good Man, it is none of your Fault that it is not more univer&s;al. For we have rea&s;on to be &s;en&s;ible, that if you were not re&s;train'd by the Apprehen&s;ion of brutal and bea&s;tly Force, you would not fail to declaim with the &s;ame Heat and the &s;ame Bitterne&s;s again&s;t both Church and State.</P>
<P>This amazing Brightne&s;s of your Chari|ty, has drawn upon you the Envy of &s;ome good Men; has made you become the Ha|tred of Libertines, and the Je&s;t and Scorn of Buffoons. I, Doctor, am your Cham|pion again&s;t them all; and I have many a bickering in your Behalf, even with my moderate Friends; who are indeed for re|forming the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage, but are by no means for a Suppre&s;&s;ion of the Play-Hou&s;es. Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> &s;ays one of them, is too &s;evere. He does not con&s;ider the Times that we live in. The&s;e are not
<PB N="243" REF="20">
the Primitive Apo&s;tolical Times, but the la&s;t and corrupt Ages of the World. The Capital of a great Kingdom mu&s;t have Meet|ings for publick Plea&s;ure. If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is for pulling down Plays; let him name a more harmle&s;s and rea&s;onable Diver&s;ion to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the room of them. What, would he have us always at our Devotion? Or does he expect that we &s;hould be all devout? Would he have Devotion a Mode and Fa&s;hion, as it is in <HI>France?</HI> where the Rake is as devout as the Archbi|&s;hop, the Whore-ma&s;ter as the Monk, and the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Punk at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> as the mo&s;t glorious Madam <HI>de Maintenon.</HI> 'Tis true, &s;aid he, there are things in &s;ome of our Plays that I could heartily wi&s;h were out, but Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is too rigid, too har&s;h, and out of all mea&s;ure &s;evere. He does not bear with the lea&s;t Faults, and &s;eems to have no Indulgence for Human Frailty. Thus, Doctor, you were attack'd the other Day by a Friend of mine, and you &s;hall &s;ee how I defended you.</P>
<P>Lord, Sir, &s;ays I, you are the mo&s;t mi|&s;taken Man in the World. Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is no &s;uch Per&s;on as you imagine. He is a good-natur'd, &s;weet temper'd Man as lives, and will bear as far as any Man whatever. And as for your &s;aying that he has no In|dulgence for Human Frailty, why 'tis a &s;ign that you don't know him. 'Tis true, &s;he has taken a fatal Aver&s;ion to the Play-<PB N="244" REF="21">
Hou&s;e; and he will down with it. We have all of us an Aver&s;ion for &s;omething or other. And why &s;hould you be &s;o much concern'd for that <HI>Rendezvous of Rakes and Strumpets?</HI> But yet Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has Indulgence enough for them too, any where but in the Play-Hou&s;e. And where's the mighty Hard&s;hip then upon them? Are there no places for them to a&s;&s;emble at, but there? Are there not Taverns, Brandy-Shops, Coffee-Hou&s;es, Chocolate-Hou&s;es, Ga|ming-Hou&s;es for the Rakes; and <HI>Indian</HI>-Hou&s;es, Mu&s;ick-Hou&s;es, Bawdy-Hou&s;es, either for Strumpets &s;olitary, or Strumpets and Rakes in Conjunction according as they plea&s;e? Has Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> writ one Word for five Years together again&s;t any of the&s;e Places? For God&s;ake what do you call want of Indulgence then? Is not every Coffee-Hou&s;e in Town grown a Gaming-Hou&s;e? May not we go every Hour of the Day into &s;everal of them, and &s;ee and hear twenty fellows &s;wearing and bla&s;pheming, and one &s;urrounded by that horrid Crew,<Q> 
<L>Shaking with bloody Oaths the Box,</L>
<L>And calling upon Plague and Pox</L>
<L>T' a&s;&s;i&s;t him?</L></Q></P>
<P>Why, there they may &s;wear and be damn'd for all Mr. <HI>Collier.</HI> He troubles him&s;elf with &s;wearing no where but in the Play-<PB N="245" REF="22">
Hou&s;e? But what do you mean by Human Frailty? When People are wicked in ear|ne&s;t that's &s;omething. He has nothing to &s;ay again&s;t &s;uch. But to be vicious in Je&s;t, to play the fool with the Devil, to counter|feit Sin for&s;ooth on pretence of decrying it, why the&s;e are <HI>dreadful Provocations, this is flaming and outragious Wickedne&s;s;</HI> and Wickedne&s;s which he is po&s;itively and ab&s;olutely re&s;olv'd that he will not endure.</P>
<P>Come, come, &s;ays he, I begin to be &s;en|&s;ible of the Matter. Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is now de|clining in Years; and the Affairs of the World go not according to his Wi&s;hes: And Age and Di&s;appointments have &s;ower'd his Blood, and made him lo&s;e the reli&s;h of Sports and gay Diver&s;ions. Once more, &s;aid I, you are the mo&s;t mi&s;taken Man in the World; Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is far from being a Foe to the gaye&s;t Sports and Pa&s;times; but then he is for having tho&s;e who fre|quent them take the Con&s;ent and Appro|bation of the <HI>Nonjuring</HI> Clergy along with them, who you know are <HI>Per&s;ons of Sobri|ety and Conduct.</HI> He'll tell you, that the Sports that good Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> appointed for the Sabbath, were not only &s;afe but commendable. That for Example, Cricket when it came to be &s;o recommended, im|mediately became Canonical, Foot-ball Or|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hodox, and Juggle-Cat <HI>Jure Divino.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">or the Layety to be &s;o impertinent as to

<P>The Play-Hou&s;e, &s;aid I, is one of tho&s;e Di|ver&s;ions which Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> believes to be too lu&s;cious a Pa&s;time for the Layety. To &s;ee and to read Plays, he thinks is enough for one of his e&s;tabli&s;h'd Virtue. And it mu&s;t be own'd, that he has read or &s;een more than any Per&s;on in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> As for the Layety, le&s;s vigorous Diver&s;ions may &s;erve them. The Men may take a Game at Bowls in the Summer, and a Game at Whisk in the Winter. The Women in Winter may vi&s;it their grave Relations, and in Summer Evenings may take a Boat to cool them&s;elves. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame Company for the mo&s;t that frequents the <HI>Park</HI> freque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the <HI>Play-Hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE>For as for the <HI>Park,</HI> he &s;ays, that is a place that <HI>is too much fre|quented by Rakes and Strumpets.

Now who,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Collier, would tru&s;t his Health in a Place of Mortality, or go to the Pe&s;thou&s;e for Re|creation?</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> like a Per&s;on
<PB N="247" REF="24">
of Conduct and Sobriety, treats the Layety with the &s;ame Circum&s;pection, that a <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t does his Congregation at high Ma&s;s, who only delivers the Wafer to the People, and re&s;erves the Wine for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But, Doctor, I had almo&s;t forgot one Thing, that I urg'd among the re&s;tin your Defence, and that was the Rea&s;on why you &s;tick &s;o clo&s;e to the Play-Hou&s;e, and let &s;ome other flaming Vices alone, which he was plea|&s;ed to enumerate; and that was, that you took this way of proceeding, to be laying the Ax to the Devili&s;h Root of the accur&s;ed Bran|ches, that the Play-Hou&s;e was the undoubted Cau&s;e of all the Iniquity in the Nation; and that if we could but down with that, a &s;udden Reformation would follow among all &s;orts of People. That Porters would no longer be drunk with Belch. That vigor|ous Captains would be tilting no more at hand&s;ome Drawers in Taverns. That lo|&s;ing Game&s;ters would no more Bla&s;pheme: And my Lady <HI>Dabcheek</HI>'s Ba&s;&s;et Bank would be immediately broke.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the things that I have &s;aid in your behalf to &s;everal of the Enemies of your <HI>Short View</HI> and <HI>Defence.</HI> I now come to tell you what has happen'd upon the re|ceiving your <HI>Di&s;&s;ua&s;ive;</HI> tho' 'tis &s;carce three Hours &s;ince its Arrival. Immediate|ly upon the reading it, my elde&s;t Son <HI>Jack</HI> told me that he was perfectly &s;atisfied that
<PB N="248" REF="25">
Plays were abominable; and taking his Hat, his Sword and his Cloak, went away for St. <HI>James</HI>'s. My elde&s;t Daughter <HI>Su&s;an</HI> is gone to take a Walk in the Garden, to meditate there in the dark; that &s;he may have the Arguments in Readine&s;s, by which &s;he &s;ays &s;he de&s;igns to convert her Si&s;ter. But my younger Son <HI>Charles</HI> made &s;ome Objections, and &s;o did my Daughter <HI>Har|riet,</HI> which I here &s;end you as well as I can recollect them; becau&s;e I know, Doctor, that you are able to an&s;wer them better than I can.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Charles,</HI> I have promis'd my Lady <HI>Freelove</HI> to Day, to wait upon her to the Play, and &s;o has my Si&s;ter <HI>Harriet;</HI> but for the future I promi&s;e you to keep away, and &s;o I dare &s;ay will my Si&s;ter, if you will but an&s;wer &s;ome Objections that we have to make again&s;t Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>I know no Rea&s;on, why Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> &s;hould pretend to meddle with our Diver|&s;ions. If he is really offended at Plays him|&s;elf, in the name of God let him keep a|way, I know no body who is fond of his Company there. But &s;ince we don't pre|tend to oblige him to come, why &s;hould he pre&s;ume to oblige us to keep away?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is really offended at Play-Hou&s;es, I would fain know how long he he has been &s;o, or what is the Rea&s;on that he did not write again&s;t them when he was
<PB N="249" REF="26">
young: For the Stage was really then more licentious than it is now. Since he forbore writing again&s;t them till he was old, we humbly de&s;ire that we may not leave them till we are old. And then perhaps we may have &s;ome natural or &s;ome politick Con&s;i|derations that may oblige us to rail as much as he does.</P>
<P>How comes this Man to take up &s;o much Concern for us? Is it Chri&s;tian Charity, and a tender Care for our Souls? I would fain ask him one Que&s;tion, Is not true Religi|on that which is chiefly nece&s;&s;ary for the Salvation of Souls? If he &s;ays it is, why then let me ask him another Que&s;tion: Is the Religion which we of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of <HI>England</HI> profe&s;s the true one, or is it not? If it is, why does not he hold Com|munion with us? If it is not, why does not he &s;et us right? Has he a Concern for our Souls, or not? If he has, why does he not mind the main thing? If he has not, why does he pretend to make us unea&s;ie, and &s;et us together by the Ears about Trifles?</P>
<P>Is it a Concern for the State that makes him take up his Pen? becau&s;e perhaps he believes that the Corruptions of the Stage may prove of dangerous Con&s;equence to the Government. But if he has that extream Concern for it, Why does he not take an Oath to be true to it? Why does he not Abjure the Gentleman who dwells at St.
<PB N="250" REF="27">
<HI>Germains?</HI> He believes us Schi&s;maticks, and he believes us Rebels, and takes no Notice of the Matter. But if we talk of going to a Play, the Man's Zeal grows fla|ming and outragious upon it. Certainly his is a very nice, and very extraordinary Charity!</P>
<P>But if he is offended at Plays, &s;o much as he pretends, why does he &s;ee them, why does he read them &s;o much? Why &s;hould he be &s;o ridiculou&s;ly conceited, and &s;o &s;pi|ritually proud, as to think that he can &s;tand under Temptations, under which we mu&s;t fall?</P>
<P>If he has &s;o much Aver&s;ion for Plays as he pretends, if they are &s;o very horrible, why has he read &s;o many, why has he done Evil that Good may come of it? If he really loves them, and they are not &s;o abominable, Why has he writ again&s;t them? If he has writ again&s;t Plays that he loves, How comes it that he &s;ays nothing again&s;t the Church and State which he hates?</P>
<P>What Rea&s;on can be given for that, un|le&s;s that he waits for his Opportunity, which by &s;etting us at Variance about Trifles, he hopes in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to ha&s;ten; or un|le&s;s, while in the Face of the World he is bombarding the Stage, he is diligently in pri|vate undermining the Church and the State?</P>
<P>In this Age of univer&s;al Toleration, when Non&s;en&s;e of every Sort and Size is tolerat|ed,
<PB N="251" REF="28">
not only that gloomy, &s;ullen, lifele&s;s Non&s;en&s;e, which is to be heard at <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Anabapti&s;t</HI> Meetings; but that &s;park|ling, &s;pirited, fiery Fu&s;tian which is to be found in our <HI>Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives;</HI> in an Age in which Schi&s;m it &s;elf is tolerated, Here&s;ie is tolerated; nay, when Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Ja|cobite Congregation is tolerated; in this Age of univer&s;al Toleration for Hypocri|&s;ie and Non&s;en&s;e, &s;hall we &s;uffer an Inqui|&s;ition to be &s;et up for Wit, and Sen&s;e and Plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>We are willing to have all the Indulgence in the World, for the Errors and Frailties of our Fellow Creatures; and tho' we may believe &s;ome of them Schi&s;maticks, believe &s;ome of them Hereticks, yet we are not for reforming them again&s;t their Wills, nor &s;aving them out of Malice. And we thought we might have hop'd, at lea&s;t that the Go|vernment might have hop'd, that at the &s;ame time that it indulges &s;ome of them, not only in different ways of Wor&s;hip, but ways which are di&s;agreeable, and &s;ome of them prejudicial to it, and ways which nei|ther are, nor were, nor ever will be to|lerated in any other Kingdom of <HI>Europe;</HI> we thought, I &s;ay, that the Government might have hop'd that the&s;e very Per&s;ons would have born with a Diver&s;ion, which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd by that, and which is not only protected by each of the Governments of
<PB N="252" REF="29">
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Kingdoms in <HI>Europe,</HI> but which has had always the Allowance of publick Authority in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Nations; and has been believed by them all to be the fitte&s;t Entertainment that can be allow'd by publick Authority. At a time when the Government has &s;hewn &s;o much Indulgence for them; might it not be ex|pected that they &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome Regard for that, and not demand with furious Cla|mours, the Suppre&s;&s;ion of an Entertain|ment, e&s;tabli&s;h'd by its Authority? For are not the&s;e Clamours again&s;t the Queen who&s;e Servants the Players are? Is it not her that they attack thro' them? And may not we rea&s;onably fear, that as they begin this Re|formation as they did that in Forty, &s;o if they are &s;uffer'd to go on, they will end it like that, and bring all things into Con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, con&s;ider, have we &s;pent &s;o much Blood and Trea&s;ure in the Defence of our Liberties, and &s;hall we &s;uffer an In|qui&s;ition to be &s;et up for that which is the very Life and Soul of Liberty, and that is harmle&s;s Plea&s;ure? for 'tis for harmle&s;s Plea&s;ure we only contend. Let the Cor|ruptions of the Stage be bani&s;h'd, but let the re&s;t remain. Yet at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be allowed that it is not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> who is a proper Judge of their Innocence or their Guilt. One would judge my Lord Cham|berlain

and the Ma&s;ter of the Revels have common Sen&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h right from wrong. Is Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> a Per&s;on fit to be appeal'd to from them?

<P>Shall we not only &s;uffer an Inqui&s;ition to be &s;et up for Plea&s;ure, but as it were by univer&s;al implicit con&s;ent permit his Di&s;|ciples to &s;et up them&s;elves for Inqui&s;itors?

<P>What has Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> to do with our Di|ver&s;ions? Let him prove the Authority of his Mi&s;&s;ion to Preach up the aboli&s;hing of that heathen Invention a Play-Hou&s;e.

<PB N="254" REF="31">
when at the &s;ame time we have &s;uf|fer'd him &s;o long to meet in his &s;eparate Congregations, where we rea&s;onably be|lieve that he has a De&s;ign upon us. Cer|tainly his is a plea&s;ant Charity, who in the very Hour of Death can ab&s;olve an Impe|nitent Traytor, and damn a poor Fellow with Ab&s;olute Power only for going to the Play-Hou&s;e. What can he mean at this time of Day, when our Religion and Laws and Liberties are in the utmo&s;t Danger, from the De&s;igns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> a|broad, and a ba&s;e perfidious Party at home, thus to divert Men from looking after their All, by &s;caring them with ridiculous Pre|&s;ages from the Corruptions of the Stage? If Corruptions contrary to the Queen's Knowledge have crept into our Theatres, and Corruptions too enormous to be born by his &s;crupulous Virtue, why did he not, as his Loyalty oblig'd him to do, humbly Petition her Maje&s;ty to redre&s;s them, in|&s;tead of making u&s;e of the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s, to rai&s;e &s;editious Clamours a|gain&s;t her Conduct to the People?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd there are Cor|ruptions which are crept into our Theatres, for into what Human Inventions will not Corruptions creep, &s;ince it is plain that they in&s;en&s;iby creep into Religion which is of Divine E&s;tabli&s;hment; but 'twould be a mon&s;trous Conclu&s;ion, that becau&s;e of

the Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> reveal'd Religion ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and Men to turn Dei&s;ts or Athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are Pa&s;&s;ages in &s;everal of our Plays, which I could heartily wi&s;h were out. But neither do I &s;ee a quarter &s;o many as Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> does, nor do I look upon tho&s;e which I do &s;ee thro' his mag|nifying Opticks, The long View that he has taken of Smutt, as he very quaintly calls it, in his <HI>&s;hort View of the Stage,</HI> puts me in mind of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Grote&s;que that is at my Lady <HI>Freelove</HI>'s; where there is an Antick Frier who has ca&s;t off his Frock, &s;quinting thro' a Micro&s;cope at a wanton Nun who has thrown off her Petticoat. But Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is mi&s;taken, if he thinks that to di&s;cern &s;ome certain matters, he has need of a magnifying Gla&s;s. He has a Hawks, nay an Eagles Eye of his own at them; and I dare &s;ay, can &s;ee as clearly and as di&s;tinctly through two Petticoats and a Smock, as <HI>Eu&s;tace Cummins,</HI> of Immortal Memory, could &s;wear through a two Inch Board.</P>
<P>'Tis very true, Sir, as I ob&s;erved before, that there are &s;everal things in our Come|dies which I could wi&s;h had been left out; and there are particularly &s;ome Bawdy Pa&s;|&s;ages in them, which I wi&s;h the Authors had had more re&s;pect for the Audi|ence in general, and for the Fair Sex in
<PB N="256" REF="33">
particular, than to have in&s;erted in them. But does he think our Virtue &s;o very weak, either the Ladies or the Gentlemens, that we cannot give them a tran&s;itory Hearing without being debauch'd by them, while his it &s;eems is &s;o very &s;trong, that he can dwell for Months upon them, and make a full Collecti|on of them, a Collection which has taught &s;everal of our Ladies more Bawdy in two Hours, than they could have learn'd in &s;o ma|ny Years at the Play-Hou&s;e? Does he believe that no body ought to entertain them ob|&s;cenely but him&s;elf? Or does he pretend to erect a Monopoly for Bawdy, to retail it to his Stationers as oft as his Occa&s;ions re|quire? 'Tis true, there are Corruptions which have crept into our Theatres, and the&s;e Corruptions ought to be reformed; but therefore ought the Stage to be ruin'd? Is not the Corruption of the Stage an evi|dent Proof of its original Goodne&s;s? &s;ince what is originally wicked never can be cor|rupted: But in what Human Conver&s;ation is there not Corruption?</P>
<P>Does Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> really believe that there is no &s;wearing in Gaming-Hou&s;es? No In|triegues at <HI>India</HI> or Chocolate-Hou&s;es? No Lying, and no Sharping in Coffee-Hou&s;es? no bea&s;tly Lewdne&s;s at Mu&s;ick-Hou&s;es, and Bawdy-Hou&s;es? If he believes that the&s;e Places are guilty of the Crimes imputed to them, Why does he not Preach to them,
<PB N="257" REF="34">
which have a great deal more Occa&s;ion for Reformation than the Play-Hou&s;e? For in mo&s;t of them you have Venom without Pre&s;ervative; but the Play-Hou&s;e carries, or &s;hould carry, the Antidote with the Poi|&s;on. If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has &s;een any of the&s;e Places, as 'tis hard to believe that one of his Experience &s;hould not have been at &s;ome of them, methinks he &s;hould be con|vinc'd, that by correcting of them, he would begin with the Head, whereas now he but plea&s;es and tickles Corruption, by catching Reformation by the Tail. A little com|mon Sen&s;e may &s;erve to convince a Man, that the reforming the Stage would never reform the Town; but the reforming the Town would certainly reform the Stage.</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on then that Mr. <HI>Col|lier,</HI> neglecting the Vices of the Town, keeps &s;uch a Bu&s;tle at tho&s;e of the Stage? Why? becau&s;e it is not his De&s;ign or Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to correct or reform any thing. His only Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;et up him&s;elf. To e|rect an ob&s;cure Schi&s;matical Par&s;on into a Saint of the fir&s;t Magnitude. To pa&s;s for a Man of more Sanctity than all the Bi&s;hops, and of more Di&s;cernment than all the Mini|&s;ters of State. His Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to cor|rect and reform, but to amu&s;e, to puzzle, to make a Noi&s;e and a Party; to make the Stage the Apple of Di&s;&s;ention, to &s;et us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> untimely Variance at this dangerous

Juncture. He has Experience enough of the World, to know that a Noi&s;e and a Party is not to be made by barely attacking of Vice. For by doing that he would ob|lige only the Virtuous. And, alas! they are but few; and a &s;ilent, a mode&s;t, and an humble Party. But by attacking the Stage, he obliges the Vitious too; and they are numerous, and pert, and ar|rogant, and noi&s;ie, and tumultuous. 'Tis true, the Virtuous are Enemies to the Vices and Corruptions of the Stage. But only the Guilty and the Hypocrites are E|nemies to a Stage reform'd; becau&s;e a Stage reform'd would be Enemies only to them. When Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> began to write his <HI>&s;hort View,</HI> he de&s;igned to oblige only the fir&s;t; for in the beginning of that Book, his In|tent is plainly to reform the Stage. But then afterwards he wi&s;ely con&s;ider'd, that the obliging the Virtuous would not do his Bu&s;ine&s;s. They are not enough to cry up their Champion, and bring him into Reputation. But if he appear'd an Enemy to the Stage it &s;elf, and attempted to de|&s;troy it in&s;tead of reforming it, why then he would oblige all the doubty Hectors in Vir|tue, a numerous Multitude of fal&s;e Braves, who would infallibly &s;tand Buff for him, and be his Bully Backs on occa&s;ion. He knew of old the Catalogue of tho&s;e who were Enemies to Satyr, and he knew that all the

<P>I know, Sir, that you under&s;tand the O|riginal very well, and therefore I will not pre|tend to interpret <HI>Horace</HI> to you litterally, but I de&s;ire your leave to make &s;ome Ob&s;erva|tions upon him by way of Paraphra&s;e, which will &s;et his Sen&s;e in a clearer Light, and convince you of this important Truth, that all who would appear what they are not, are mortal Enemies to Comedy, becau&s;e the Comick Poet is perpetually upon the hunt for Originals; and every one would

<P>The Fir&s;t is he, <HI>Qui ob avaritiam labo|rat.</HI> A gogling, &s;narling, groaning, pray|ing Rogue; though at the &s;ame time an U|&s;urer and an Extortioner; a Fellow &s;o no|toriou&s;ly given to cheating, that he defrauds even him&s;elf of Nece&s;&s;aries; who can dine on a Prayer, as Sir <HI>John Denham</HI> &s;ays, and &s;up on an Exhortation; one who makes a Stalking-Hor&s;e of Religion, and lies &s;culk|ing behind it with no other Purpo&s;e than to draw Wild-Gee&s;e within his Reach.</P>
<P>The other, Sir, is he; <HI>Qui mutat merces,</HI> &amp;c.

A Per&s;on who will &s;tick at no manner of Villany, but is kindly con|tented to be damn'd, only that his great boobily Boy may get half a dozen Claps,

half a &s;core Surfeits, lo&s;e half his E&s;tate at the Groom-Porters, be cheated of the o|ther half by Sharpers who are Under Spur-Leathers, and jog on to the Devil a little more gayly than his Father. In the mean time this good-natur'd Father leads a mo&s;t exemplary Life. In the Morning while his Servants are bu&s;ie at the Water-&s;ide, he walks about the City to pull down Play-Bills, cheat tho&s;e who deal with him, to cau&s;e all the Beggars that he finds in his way to be whip'd, tho' at that very time he is going to augment the Number of them; to vi&s;it Watch-Men, Headboroughs and Petty-Con&s;tables, and charge them that if they find any hand&s;ome Whore upon their Watch, they &s;hould bring her to him the next Morning; and lea&s;t the Con&s;table or the Watch &s;hould have a wambling to her them&s;elves, for &s;uch things he remembers have been formerly done, he reads a long Lecture to them again&s;t Concupi&s;cence, and then goes home and gravely dines with his Family. The Afternoon he pa&s;&s;es in walk|ing from Tavern to Tavern, in which he drinks above twenty Nipperkins, in as ma|ny &s;everal Kitchens, to &s;ee that there is no Swearing nor no Prophane&s;s there, but that People, as he thinks it behoves good Chri|&s;tians, get devoutly and religiou&s;ly drunk; till growing more and more inflam'd with Canary and Zeal, and being full of them
<PB N="262" REF="39">
both, he is oblig'd at la&s;t to di&s;embogue him&s;elf, which he does of each, by &s;pew|ing and preaching in turns. And after he has thus performed his Duty to the Pub|lick; and fortified him&s;elf for the better Performance of private Duties, he goes home like a good Man, to fa&s;t and pray with his Family: I &s;ay to fa&s;t, Sir, not out of Covetou&s;ne&s;s or Super&s;tition, but that he may &s;ecure the Cha&s;tity of his Daugh|ters by mortifying the Old Man in them, and the Youths of his Family.</P>
<P>But, Sir, by your &s;haking your Head, and your biting your Lip, I am to believe you mi&s;take me. I am not here for ma|king a Satyr upon the City. I know very well that this City is the only true and &s;o|lid Foundation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Strength. Nor am I &s;uch a Fool as to believe that Sen&s;e or Honour are confined to Place. I am my &s;elf acquainted with a great many Citizens, who are very e&s;timable Members of the Commonwealth; I know &s;everal a|mong them who are not only Men of Sen&s;e and Honour, but of Wit and Plea&s;antry. I know &s;everal of them, who&s;e true Zeal for Religion is &s;hewn by all that engaging Charity, that attractive Humility, and lovely Meekne&s;s, which are the only Signs of a good Chri&s;tian. And for &s;uch true Chri|&s;tians, whether they may belong to the Church or Meeting-Hou&s;e, no Man has a
<PB N="263" REF="40">
greater Re&s;pect than I have; who judge of Mens Devotion, not by the Errors of their Under&s;tandings, but by the Sincerity of their Hearts. But every Hypocrite, to talk in Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s extraordinary Dialect, is the Di&s;plea&s;ure and Di&s;ea&s;e of my Eyes. I hunt him, as <HI>Boileau</HI> &s;ays, as a Dog does his Game, and as &s;oon as ever I &s;mell him, I bark immediately. And, with Submi&s;&s;i|on to you, Sir, I believe I am in the right of it; and that the Hypocrites in Chri&s;tian Warfare ought to be more &s;everely handled, than a Strumpet or a Libertine, as we treat an open declar'd Enemy le&s;s rigorou&s;ly than a Spy. That the number of Hypocrites in the City is very great, the Men of true De|votion there will be the fir&s;t to acknow|ledge. 'Tis to the Level of them that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has particularly writ: Every thing in his <HI>&s;hort View,</HI> his <HI>Defence,</HI> and his <HI>Di&s;|&s;ua&s;ive</HI> appears to be adapted to them; the Sophi&s;try of his Deductions, the equivoca|ting and prevaricating of his Citations, the Finicalne&s;s of his Language, and the Pha|ri&s;aical Arrogance of his Zeal. By gain|ing of the&s;e he knew he &s;hould compa&s;s both the Ends, for the which he writ. The fir&s;t of which was, that he &s;hould engage a numerous Party to make a Noi&s;e and to bully for him; of which he did not fail.</P>
<P>For it is notoriou&s;ly known, that in the late Reign, &s;everal Per&s;ons of the foremen|tion'd
<PB N="264" REF="41">
Stamp, who pretended to meet to|gether for the &s;upport of the Laws and the Government, di&s;charg'd their Malice in a publick manner again&s;t &s;everal Gentlemen of known Loyalty and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Principles; only that they might do an acceptable thing to a Man whom they knew to be a mortal Enemy to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The other End that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> pro|bably propos'd to him&s;elf, by exa&s;perating the noi&s;ie and clamorous Part of the City again&s;t the Theatres, might be to animate them again&s;t the People of Quality who&s;e Pre&s;ence &s;upports them, and the Court who&s;e Authority protects them. That this is no chimerical Conjecture, may be thought by any one who takes a &s;hort View of Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Principles. For from this Pro|ceeding he might ea&s;ily fore&s;ee one of the&s;e two Con&s;equences. For upon the&s;e Cla|mours and Outcries, either the Play-Hou&s;es would be &s;uppre&s;s'd, or they would be pro|tected. If they were &s;uppre&s;s'd, he ea&s;ily &s;aw the Gentry would be di&s;oblig'd, and that would be a pretty hand&s;ome Step to|wards &s;ome farther Reformations and Al|terations. But if upon the&s;e Clamours they were not &s;uppre&s;s'd, why then he had a great deal of Rea&s;on to hope that the City would grow &s;ullen and &s;ower. And if their being out of Humour was of &s;uch danger|ous Con&s;equence in the Days of Brother
<PB N="265" REF="42">
<HI>Pryn</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed Memory, when the Court appear'd to have &s;o little Occa&s;ion for them; he believ'd that it might be of greater Mo|ment now, when he knew that by the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the Times, the Court was oblig'd to demand their A&s;&s;i&s;tance frequently.</P>
<P>Sir, you have often told me with extream Goodne&s;s, that you requir'd no Obedience to any Commands that you laid upon us, if they did not appear to be rea&s;onable; be|cau&s;e God him&s;elf, you have been plea&s;ed to tell us, required only our rea&s;onable Ser|vice. But, Sir, can you believe it rea&s;on|able, that I &s;hould be of another Man's O|pinion again&s;t my own Sentiments, when it appears &s;o plainly that he is not of his own? For, Sir, can any thing be more e|vident than that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is moved to write again&s;t the Stage by another Motive than that which he pretends? His Motive perhaps may be human Policy, but it can never be Charity; or perhaps 'tis Spleen, or Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or Pride, or Arrogance, or Fear. I &s;ay Fear, Sir. For has not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> Rea&s;on to apprehend the Stage as well as Hypocrites of the foremention'd Characters? For is it not evident, that at the &s;ame time that he is &s;etting up for a Fir&s;t-Rate Reformer, he has &s;hewn to the World, that he is but a Fifth-Rate Come|dian? And while he pretends to condemn Acting upon the Stage, is Acting a Part
<PB N="266" REF="43">
upon the Stage of the World &s;o aukwardly and &s;o ridiculou&s;ly, that all who are fur|ni&s;h'd with common Sen&s;e have found it to be Comedy? For, whom does he pretend to reform? Is it not the People, as I ob&s;er|ved before, who&s;e Religion he abhors, and who&s;e Government he hates? And does he not know very well, that by reforming our Manners, he would run Counter to his own De&s;igns and Wi&s;hes? becau&s;e Refor|mation of Manners would confirm the pre|&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment both in Church and State; and can he then really de&s;ign to reform us? But how does he propo&s;e to him&s;elf, to bring this about? Why, not by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Vice, but the Stage, that &s;courges and ex|po&s;es it. For he meddles not with that Vice that is in the World, let it be never &s;o <HI>flaming and outragious.</HI> For Example, the crying Sin of <HI>England,</HI> next to Hypo|cri&s;ie, at this time, is Gaming; a Sin that is attended with &s;everal others, both among Men and Women, as Lying, Swearing, Per|jury, Fraud, Quarrels, Murders, Fornica|tion, Adultery. Has not Gaming done more Mi&s;chief in <HI>England,</HI> within the&s;e la&s;t five Years, than the Stage has done in Fifty? For when Women have lo&s;t va&s;t Sums at Play, which they have been afraid to own to their Fathers or Husbands, have they not often been known to pay them after a &s;hame|ful way? How can the mo&s;t inveterate Big|got
<PB N="267" REF="44">
pretend that Gaming is fomented or encouraged by the Stage? Mu&s;t he not on the contrary be obliged to own, that it is cen&s;ur'd and corrected by it? What is the Rea&s;on then, that Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> neglecting &s;o important and &s;o dangerous a Vice, a|gain&s;t which no Body has &s;aid one Word, re&s;erves all his Rage for the Play-Hou&s;e? And takes an Occa&s;ion from the late Tem|pe&s;t to threaten us with &s;ome terrible Ven|geance from Heaven, if it is not immedi|ately &s;uppre&s;t. Can any thing be more ri|diculous than this from him? For does not he wi&s;h for the greate&s;t Vengeance that Heaven can &s;end down upon us? Can any Vengeance be inflicted on a Prote&s;tant and Free People more terrible than Slavery and Idolatry? Is not the late Tempe&s;t, though dreadful in it &s;elf, yet a very Trifle com|pared to tho&s;e? Tho' the late Storm &s;hould return, <HI>and Nature &s;hould once more appear to be in her la&s;t Agony, and the World be ready to expire;</HI> would not every one, who has Noble <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Principles, chu&s;e ra|ther to &s;ee it peri&s;h, than to lo&s;e his Religion and his Liberty? Be&s;ides, Has the late Tempe&s;t any thing to do with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Play-Hou&s;e? What can Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> mean then by threatening us with terrible Vengeance, at the &s;ame time that he wi&s;hes it; and by engaging us in frivolous and groundle&s;s Di&s;&s;entions, endeavours all
<PB N="268" REF="45">
that he can to bring it on us at the very time he pretends to avert it?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Zeal were &s;incere; he would neither go about to frighten us with things, which it is plain that he is not afraid of; nor, neglecting more dangerous Crimes, would he attack the le&s;s. Be&s;ides, it is plain that he him&s;elf has not that Opinion of the Stage, into which he would fool and delude us. For if the Cau&s;e of the Stage were &s;o bad as he would make us believe, or if it were out of Charity that he attack'd it, what need he make u&s;e of notorious Fal&s;hood to decry it? 'Tis a plea&s;ant Charity that en|gages a Man to be damn'd him&s;elf to re|form others. Be&s;ides, what Occa&s;ion has Truth to have Recour&s;e to Fal&s;hood, which may &s;ometimes indeed &s;upport Fal&s;hood, but mu&s;t always to di&s;cerning Eyes render Truth &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>You know, Sir, that it is ea&s;ie for me to prove, that in this &s;hort Letter addre&s;t to you, Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has Recour&s;e to Fal&s;|hood. For can any thing be more plain, even from the Artifice of his Addre&s;s to you? Does not he here, to make the World believe that he has the <HI>Countenance of Figure and Fortune,</HI> Palm you upon the Town for a Per&s;on of Quality, who are only a private Gentleman?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is mov'd by Charity to ex|claim thus loudly again&s;t the Stage, let me
<PB N="269" REF="46">
ask him one Que&s;tion, Who are the Per|&s;ons whom he de&s;igns to reform? They who never come to a Play-Hou&s;e, methinks &s;hould have no Occa&s;ion for his Correcti|ons. If his De&s;ign is on tho&s;e who come thither, why does he not in&s;inuate him&s;elf into their Affections, by the Meekne&s;s and Humility of his Expre&s;&s;ions, and the at|tractive Language of Charity? Why has he Recour&s;e to &s;uch pre&s;umptuous Arrogance, is ju&s;tly renders him the Aver&s;ion of &s;ome, and the Scorn of others? With him, an Au|dience which you very well knew, Sir, is often one of the mo&s;t venerable and awful A&s;&s;emblies that can any where be found, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> A&s;&s;embly of Rakes and Strumpets: Buf|fons are the Poets, and the Players Liber|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ines.

<P>Be&s;ides, there is &s;omething in Mr. <HI>Col|lier</HI>'s Style with which Truth is almo&s;t in|compatible, and that is Affectation, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> always fal&s;e. Truth is plain, and &s;imple, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd natural, and, as &s;he can have no De|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ect in her, is but hid by Ornament.

But then that Orna|ment mu&s;t be in Nature, and con&s;equently
<PB N="270" REF="47">
true. But Affectation is always fal&s;e, and can no more con&s;i&s;t with Truth than Dark|ne&s;s can with Light. What I have ob&s;er|ved of Man in general, may be &s;aid of Wri|ters, That Affectation is a certain Sign in them of want of Sincerity, or of Under|&s;tanding, and very often of both.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s is the mo&s;t affected, mo&s;t foppi&s;h Style that ever I met with in Ancient or Modern Authors; of which I will undertake to convince any impartial Man, if he is but a tolerable Judge of Wri|ting.</P>
<P>But to return from Words to Things: I have not time enough to di&s;play the perpe|tual Sophi&s;try of his Inferences, or rather his no Inferences; for a Metaphor or an Al|legory is with him an Argument, and &s;o is often an Hyperbole. But I &s;hall &s;ay a Word of his more than Je&s;uitical prevaricating in his Authorities. I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t upon two, the one of which he brings from Old, and the other from Modern <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Pray, Sir, let me &s;ee Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Letter: Ay, here the Authorities are.<Q>The Republick of <HI>Rome,</HI> before <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> &s;topt the building of a Theatre; being fully convinc'd, that this Diver&s;ion would bring in Foreign Vice, that the old <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue would be lo&s;t, and the Spirits of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> People ema&s;culated.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="48">
To prove this, he refers his Reader to his <HI>Defence of the &s;hort View.</HI> That is, he endeavours to &s;upport the Sham which he puts upon the World now, by that which he put upon it five Years ago. 'Tis true, after all, Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> &s;peaks the Truth here, but 'tis da&s;h'd and brew'd with a Ven|geance. 'Tis true, the <HI>Romans</HI> did &s;top the building of a Theatre, before the Time of <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> But would he pa&s;s this upon us for one Act of the <HI>Roman</HI> People, or for their con&s;tant Sen&s;e?

<P>Is not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> now a mo&s;t &s;hameful Hypocrite? For does not he know that the <HI>Romans</HI> had the highe&s;t Veneration for Plays imaginable? Is not every School-Boy who has read <HI>Terence</HI> convinc'd of it? Do not his Comedies tell us by their Titles that they were part of the Religion of that People?

<P>I think, Sir, I have made it plainly ap|pear, that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is one who has Rea|&s;on to be afraid of Theatres, and therefore to hate them. For he is one of tho&s;e with a Vengeance who endeavour to appear what they are not. And tho' now-a-days a Prie&s;t is not &s;uffer'd to be brought upon the Stage, yet I que&s;tion whether he is to be regarded as a Prie&s;t, who wears a Sword of five Foot long, and a Peruke of three, and goes about reforming in the &s;ame Ha|bit, in which the <HI>French</HI> Dragoons are at this very Juncture piou&s;ly reforming the <HI>Ce|vennois.</HI></P>

yet reach'd my &s;eventeenth Year, am able to make a very ju&s;t Apology in behalf of my &s;elf and all the Women of Condition in <HI>England,</HI> whom he has &s;o ba&s;ely affront|ed. Tho' we are not pleas'd with the Inde|cencies or Immoralities of Plays, yet not|with&s;tanding that we frequent them, be|cau&s;e &s;ome Diver&s;ion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for us, and becau&s;e perhaps ev'n mo|dern Plays, with all the Faults imputed to them, are the mo&s;t innocent of the Diver|&s;ions which the Town affords.</P>
<P>The Diver&s;ions that the Town affords, are chiefly reduc'd to four, 1. Gaming, 2. Mu&s;ick-Meetings. 3. Balls and Meetings for Dancing. 4. Going to Plays. Now of all the&s;e, I am apt to believe that Plays are the mo&s;t innocent, for the following Rea&s;ons. They rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions only to correct them, whereas the others rai&s;e 'em merely for the &s;ake of inflaming them. The Plays, and more e&s;pecially Tragedies, in|&s;truct us in Virtue, which the other Diver|&s;ions do not. They improve us in lawful innocent Knowledge, which in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;upplies the want of Education in our Sex. They form our Language, and poli&s;h our Minds, and &s;o capacitate us, when we come to marry, to engage and endear our Husbands to us. For we every Day &s;ee that only Fools are con&s;tant long to Fools. Sir, in &s;hort, the Ca&s;e is thus. Diver&s;ions the
<PB N="275" REF="52">
Ladies of a great Metropolis mu&s;t have. I have particulariz'd the &s;everal Diver&s;ions which this Town affords. All the Danger, and all the Temptation which this judici|ous Per&s;on &s;uppo&s;es to be at the Play-Hou&s;e, are really in all the other Diver&s;ions, which have none of the Advantages that may be reap'd from Tragedies, for the Improve|ment either of our Virtue or Knowledge. Why then would this mighty Reformer have us leave Plays for them? Would he have us have no Diver&s;ion, or would he have us make choice of tho&s;e which have the mo&s;t Temptation?</P>
<P>True, Sir, there are Pa&s;&s;ages in &s;ome of our Plays, which I could heartily wi&s;h were out. But does he think the Virtue of the Ladies, who frequent Play-Hou&s;es, is &s;o very weak, as to be o'erthrown by the Lu|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as he calls it, of a Scribler's <HI>Double Entendre?</HI> What, have &s;o many great Examples as we find on the Stage, &s;o many noble and generous Sentiments, &s;o many accompli&s;h'd Patterns of Virtue; have all the&s;e no manner of Power to rouze, to &s;trengthen and inflame our Virtue; and &s;hall two or three wretched Equivocals, three or four mi&s;erable <HI>Double Entendres</HI> have the force to corrupt us?</P>
<P>If any of my Sex happen to find them|&s;elyes &s;o infirm, as this worthy Reformer ap|pears to own that he is; if two or three ri|diculous
<PB N="276" REF="53">
double meanings have Strength e|nough to undo them, in &s;pight of tho&s;e ex|alted Heroick Characters, which in my O|pinion &s;hould be enough to fix our Affecti|ons to that degree, that nothing that we meet with abroad in the World &s;hould have the Power to move us; if any of my Sex are &s;o infirm, let them, in God's Name, keep away from our Theatres. But I find no &s;uch &s;candalous Weakne&s;s about me. I can de&s;pi&s;e a Fool who thinks to entertain me with his &s;ordid playing on Words; but at the &s;ame time can be entertain'd with Wit and good Sen&s;e, and more with the Innocence of true writ Humour; and I can be both pleas'd and mov'd with the excellent Scenes of an In&s;tructive Tragedy: Does this judicious Per&s;on really believe, that the Con|ver&s;ations which we find in the World are Virtue and Purity all? The Food of the Mind, like that of the Body, is not all of it fit for Nouri&s;hment. But &s;trong Virtue, like &s;trong Nature, knows how to di&s;cern and &s;eparate, to reject the Bad, to a&s;&s;imu|late the Good, by which it is fed and &s;up|ported. If any of my Sex have the &s;can|dalous Weakne&s;s to have their Virtue and their Honour endanger'd by the Folly of <HI>Double Entendres,</HI> I would advi&s;e them to take their leaves of the Play-Hou&s;e. But at the &s;ame time I would advi&s;e Mr. <HI>Col|lier</HI> to per&s;uade his noble Patrons of the
<PB N="277" REF="54">
Reforming Club to erect a Prote&s;tant Nun|nery for them, for nothing le&s;s can &s;ecure them. For they who are found &s;o &s;trange|ly weak as to be warm'd by a meer painted Fire, how can they ever &s;tand again&s;t the real Flames of Love?</P>
<P>How many extraordinary Women may <HI>England</HI> boa&s;t of, &s;ince Plays were intro|duc'd among us? Among whom are three of the greate&s;t Queens that ever the World produc'd; and all of them took delight in Plays: How many Ladies of inferior Rank have frequented, and &s;till frequent 'em, who yet in Proportion are fam'd for every Vir|tue? What does this charitable Per&s;on be|lieve of our Mothers, our Aunts and Grand|mothers? Does he believe them Adultere&s;|&s;es all, becau&s;e they frequented the Play-Hou&s;e? But you, Sir, have Ju&s;tice to be|lieve better. You knew my Mother true to your Bed, as &s;he was dear to your Arms.

<P>'Tis true indeed, the Note was given up when there was little Hope of his paying the Money; and he has now, beyond all Ex|pectation, an E&s;tate left him.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the good Fortune to meet you in the City, it was with Concern that I heard from you of the At|tempt to le&s;&s;en the Reputation of Mr. <HI>Dry|den;</HI> and 'tis with Indignation that I have &s;ince learnt that that Attempt has chiefly been carried on by &s;mall Poets, who un|gratefully &s;trive to eclip&s;e the Glory of a great Man, from whom alone they derive their own faint Lu&s;tre. But that Eclip&s;e will be as Momentary as that of the Sun was lately. The Reputation of Mr. <HI>Dry|den</HI> will &s;oon break out again in its full Splendor, and theirs will di&s;appear. It was upon hearing of this A'ttempt that I reflected with &s;ome Amazement, that I
<PB N="290" REF="67">
&s;hould have got the Reputation of an ill-na|tur'd Man, by expo&s;ing the Ab&s;urdities of living Authors; and Authors for the mo&s;t part of great Mediocrity, tho' I have always done it openly and fairly, and upon ju&s;t and per&s;onal Provocations; and that the&s;e &s;hould ba&s;ely arraign the Reputation of a great Man deceas'd, who now can make no An|&s;wer for him&s;elf, and upon whom they fawn'd while living, and &s;hould yet e&s;cape uncen&s;ur'd. But when I heard that that Attempt was in favour of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble to expre&s;s to what a height my Indignati|on and Di&s;dain were rais'd. Good God! was there ever any Nation in which (I will not &s;ay a fal&s;e Ta&s;te, for we never had a true one, but in which) a wrong Sen&s;e and a fatal Delu&s;ion &s;o generally prevail'd! For have not too many of us lately appear'd to contemn every thing that is great and glo|rious, and to prai&s;e and exalt every thing that is ba&s;e and infamous? Have not too many of us &s;hewn to all the World, by a manife&s;t execrable Choice, that they prefer Weakne&s;s to Power, Folly to Wi&s;dom, Poverty to Wealth, Fury and Madne&s;s to Moderation, Infamy to Glory, Submi&s;&s;ion to Victory, Slavery to Liberty, Idolatry to Religion, the Duke of <HI>O.</HI> to the D. of <HI>M</HI> the Pretender to the Royal <HI>George</HI> our only rightful King, and Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to Mr <HI>Dryden?</HI> If I appear too warm, I hope you

will excu&s;e my Affection for the Memory, and my Zeal for the Reputation of my de|parted Friend, whom I infinitely e&s;teem'd when living for the Solidity of his Thought, for the Spring, the Warmth, and the beau|tiful Turn of it; for the Power, and Vari|ety, and Fulne&s;s of his Harmony; for the Purity, the Per&s;picuity, the Energy of his Ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and (whenever the following great Qualities are requir'd) for the Pomp and Solemnity and Maje&s;ty of his Style.</P>
<P>You may now &s;ee, Sir, by this Letter, how little mo&s;t Men know one another, who conver&s;e daily together. How many were there in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Life-time, who endeavour'd to make him believe, that I &s;hould be the foremo&s;t, if I &s;urviv'd him, of all his Acquaintance to arraign his Me|mory; whereas I am he of all his Acquain|tance, who, tho' I flatter'd him lea&s;t while living, having been contented to do him Ju&s;tice both behind his Back and before his Enemies Face, am now the foremo&s;t to a&s;|&s;ert his Merit, and to vindicate his Glory.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has Faults, (as where is the Mortal who has none?) I by &s;earching for them perhaps could find them. But what|ever the mi&s;taken World may think, I am always willing to be pleas'd, nay, am always greedy of Plea&s;ure as any <HI>Epicurean</HI> living; and whenever I am naturally touch'd, I give my &s;elf up to the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="292" REF="69">
never look for Faults. But whenever a cried-up Author, upon the fir&s;t reading him, does not make a plea&s;ing Impre&s;&s;ion on me; I am apt to &s;eek for the Rea&s;on of it, that I may know if the Fault is in him or in me. Wherever Genius runs thro' a Work, I for|give its Faults, and wherever that is want|ing no Beauties can touch me. Being &s;truck by Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Genius, I have no Eyes for his Errors; and I have no Eyes for his Enemies Beauties, becau&s;e I am not &s;truck by their Genius.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I came Home in the Coach on <HI>Friday</HI> Night, I ruminated upon the Pa&s;&s;age in Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>'s Ver&s;es to my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> and found indeed that the Words are not &s;trictly reconcileable to Purity of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Grammar;</HI> but then there are &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> which are as little in the com|pa&s;s of a regular Con&s;truction; for Exam|ple, that in the Eclogues,<Q> 
<L>Et certamen erat Corydon cum Thyr&s;ide magnum.</L></Q> And that Pa&s;&s;age in the fifth of the <HI>Aeneis,</HI> where <HI>Ni&s;us</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Aeneas</HI><Q> 
<L>&mdash;Quae munera Ni&s;o</L>
<L>Digna dabis? primam merui qui laude co|ronam;</L>
<L><PB N="294" REF="71"> Ni me, quae Salium, Fortuna inimica, tuli&s;&s;et.</L></Q> Where <HI>merui</HI> is certainly for <HI>merui&s;&s;em,</HI> and &s;o <HI>Virgil</HI> makes bold not only with the Mood but the Ten&s;e. For my Part, I am for pre&s;erving the Purity of Language ev'n in the bolde&s;t Flights of Poetry, but then I am apt to be indulgent to the Faults of great Ma&s;ters, not only becau&s;e they are few, but in Con&s;ideration of the Plea&s;ure which they have otherwi&s;e given me. He would be but an ill-natur'd Man, who af|ter having had the Plea&s;ure of enjoying a fine Woman, &s;hould fall to finding Fault with her Moles, or &s;ome other Blemi&s;hes, which perhaps after all, are only &s;o many Shadows to &s;et off her ravi&s;hing Beauties.</P>
<P>I was not a little &s;urpriz'd at the Que&s;ti|on, whether Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>'s Ver&s;es to <HI>Amo|ret</HI> mov'd me. What if they dont? Is there not the <HI>pulchrum</HI> as well as the <HI>dul|ce</HI> in Poetry? But <HI>Horace,</HI> perhaps, you'll &s;ay, is for having them both in the &s;ame Poem.<Q> 
<L>Non &s;atis e&s;t pulchra e&s;&s;e Poemata dulcia &s;unto,</L>
<L>Et quocunque volunt animum Auditoris a|gunto.</L></Q> <PB N="295" REF="72">
But then he is certainly &s;peaking of Trage|dy, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t damn mo&s;t of his own Odes. For ev'n of tho&s;e which are writ to Women, there is but one which has a great deal of Tenderne&s;s; and yet mo&s;t o; the re&s;t are undoubtedly very fine. After all, the <HI>pulchrum</HI> in Poetry moves as certainly as the <HI>dulce,</HI> but then the fir&s;t moves the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions, as the latter does the vulgar ones. Yet to come at la&s;t clo&s;e to the Que&s;tion, the Ver&s;es to <HI>Amoret</HI> move even the vulgar Pa&s;&s;ions in me, as they ought to do: It being impo&s;&s;ible to take a Survey in them of Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>'s Good-nature, and his Gratitude, without pitying and loving him.</P>

<HEAD>To the EXAMINER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Upon his wi&s;e Paper of the Tenth of January,
1710/1.</HEAD>
<P>IT was upon the fourth of this in&s;tant <HI>February</HI> that I was per&s;uaded by &s;ome of my Acquaintance to peru&s;e thy Paper of the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> in which, as they told me, it was &s;urmis'd by &s;everal, that you pretended to father upon me the Let|ter called <HI>the</HI> Engli&s;hman<HI>'s Thanks to the Duke of</HI> Marlborough. It was the &s;econd of thy Papers that I ever read, tho' I have handled &s;everal of them. Thou &s;eem'&s;t to have a great Genius for Water Language, and to be aiming at the Po&s;t and Reputati|on of Water Orator, which thou wilt fill as worthily, as <HI>Taylour</HI> did that of Water Poet. But tell me truly, what does thy Execrability mean? From whence this Pride, this In&s;olence, this Arrogance? What ha&s;t thou &s;aid, what ha&s;t thou writ, what ha&s;t thou done, to give thee the lea&s;t Shadow of a Pretence to it? Art thou &s;uch an Ide|ot to be of Opinion, that thou art the only soul-mouth'd Fellow in <HI>England?</HI> Is it &s;o
<PB N="297" REF="74">
hard a matter, think'&s;t thou, to cry <HI>Block|head, &s;tupid Head,</HI> the mo&s;t in&s;ipid and con|temptible of Mankind? Is there any Thought, any Invention, any Under&s;tanding of thine requi&s;ite for the making u&s;e of the&s;e Flow|ers of Rhetorick? Is not a Joker in a long party-colour'd Coat as capable of all this as a Joker in a long black Coat? Thou &s;ay'&s;t that I &s;hall die without knowing that I am the mo&s;t in&s;ipid and contemptible of all Hu|man Creatures. Thou art in the right of it; I &s;hall die without knowing any thing of this, tho' I live to the Age of <HI>Methu&s;alem,</HI> if I hear it from none but thee and &s;uch &s;cribling Slaves as thou art. But thou, be|fore thou die&s;t, wilt know a great deal wor&s;e than this of thy &s;elf. Before thou die&s;t, thou wilt know that thou art the mo&s;t in|&s;ipid, the vile&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible, I will not &s;ay of all Human Creatures, for Rea&s;on thou never had&s;t, and Humanity thou ha&s;t long di&s;claim'd, but the vile&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible of all Dogs; for tho' the re&s;t of thy Species bark like thee at the worthie&s;t of Men who are Strangers to them, and crouch and fawn like thee up|on the vile&s;t of Men whom they know, yet no Dog but thy &s;elf did ever fir&s;t fawn and crouch, and afterwards bark, and bite, and betray; no, never any Dog was &s;o vile be|fore as to fawn upon a Ma&s;ter thro' two Kingdoms, and afterwards to fly at his Throat.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="75">
Thus have I &s;hewn thee what thou art, and while thou art reading each Period of this, thy Con&s;cience will be thy Check, and will heartily cry <HI>Amen</HI> to it. As for me, thou art not to be told, that I have the Ap|probation, and Applau&s;e, and E&s;teem of thy Ma&s;ters; thy Ma&s;ters, who u&s;e thee like a common Whore, abhor and dete&s;t thee while they u&s;e thee, and will command their Servants to kick thee out of Doors as &s;oon as the Lu&s;t of their Ambition is &s;a|tisfied.</P>
<P>I thank my God I am altogether a Stran|ger to thy Per&s;on, but give me leave to &s;hew thee, how in&s;ipid and contemptible thou art as an Author. In&s;ipid Panegyri&s;ts are they who prai&s;e with general Compli|ments and thread-bare Commendations, Compliments which are equally applicable to all Subjects, and to u&s;e which demanded neither Imagination nor Judgment. And 'tis the&s;e Panegyri&s;ts that have been chiefly the Marks of <HI>Boileau</HI>'s judicious and ge|nerous Satyrs. In&s;ipid Libellers are they who u&s;e general Injuries and <HI>Billin&s;gate</HI> De|famations, and which the errante&s;t Fool may &s;peak of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Per&s;on, as ea|&s;ily as a Dog can bark at the Moon. Thou art one of tho&s;e in&s;ipid Libellers, and art by &s;o much more odious and more de&s;pi|cable than an in&s;ipid Panegyri&s;t, by how much a Blockhead with Ill-nature is more
<PB N="299" REF="76">
hateful and more contemptible than a Fool with good Humour.</P>
<P>The in&s;ipid Reproaches which thou u&s;e&s;t, have been utter'd a thou&s;and times by thy &s;elf of a thou&s;and different Per&s;ons. But I &s;hall &s;ay that of thee, which every one cannot &s;ay, and &s;hall &s;ay what can be &s;aid of none but thy execrable &s;elf alone; and when I have dragg'd thee from the lurking Hole, to which thy ba&s;e Fears have condemn'd thee, (for thou never had&s;t Sen&s;e enough to have Shame) and expos'd thee to the open Light, that is to eternal Infamy, then let the World judge who is the in&s;ipid and who the contemptible.</P>
<P>By thy Impudence, thy Ignorance, thy &s;ophi&s;tical arguing, thy pedantick declama|tory Style, and thy brutal <HI>Billin&s;gate</HI> Lan|guage thou can&s;t be none but &s;ome illite|rate Pedant, who has liv'd twenty Years in an Univer&s;ity; by thy being a turbu|lent hot-brain'd Incendiary, a hot-brain'd Incendiary with a cool Heart, one may ea&s;ily gue&s;s at the Univer&s;ity which gave thee thy Education. By thy wonderful Charity, thou can&s;t be nothing but a &s;candalous Prie&s;t, hateful to God and de|te&s;table to Men, and agreeable to none but Devils, who make&s;t it thy Bu&s;ine&s;s to foment Divi&s;ions between Communities and private Per&s;ons, in &s;pight of that Cha|rity which is the fundamental Doctrine of
<PB N="300" REF="77">
that Religion which thou pretend&s;t to teach. How amazing a Reflection is it, that, in &s;pight of that Divine Doctrine, the Chri&s;tian World &s;hould be the only part of the Globe embroil'd in endle&s;s Divi&s;ions. From whence can this proceed, but from Prie&s;ts like thee, who are the Pe&s;ts of Society and the Bane of Religion. But 'tis not enough to &s;ay thou art a Prie&s;t, 'tis time to point out what Prie&s;t thou art. Thou art a Prie&s;t then who mad'&s;t thy fir&s;t Appearance in the World like a dry Joker in Controver&s;y, a &s;piritual Buffoon, an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Jack Pudding,</HI> by publi&s;hing a Piece of waggi&s;h Divinity, which was writ with a De&s;ign to banter all Chri&s;tianity; yes, thou nobly be|gan'&s;t, as <HI>Judas I&s;cariot</HI> ended; began'&s;t by crucifying thy God afre&s;h, and &s;elling him to <HI>John Nutt</HI> for ten Pound and a Crown, and &s;o under-&s;elling half in half thy execra|ble Predece&s;&s;or. Had&s;t thou but had half his common Sen&s;e, thou had&s;t had his Re|mor&s;e and con&s;equently his De&s;tiny; in&s;tead of which thou fell'&s;t from &s;elling and be|traying thy God to &s;elling and betraying thy old Friends. So that had&s;t thou liv'd in the time of <HI>Judas,</HI> thou would&s;t infi|nitely have &s;urp&s;s'd him in Villany, thou woul&s;t have betray'd both Chri&s;t and all his Apo&s;tles, nay, would&s;t have undermin'd, and under&s;old, and betray'd even <HI>Judas</HI> the Be|trayer him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="78">
When thou wert come piping hot from betraying both Friends and God, thou wert often heard to cry mo&s;t impudently, but mo&s;t truly, out, that the Church was in Dan|ger. Any one may &s;wear, when it has &s;uch Prie&s;ts, that 'tis not in Danger, but upon the very brink of Ruine; and that if it were not &s;upported by God him&s;elf, it would immediately tumble.</P>
<P>Yet 'tis hard to be angry with &s;uch a Mi&s;creant, when I reflect, that he who has us'd me &s;o, has us'd his God wor&s;e. For thou ha&s;t denyed his very Being; which is to degrade him below the meane&s;t of his own Creatures, not only below Fools and Ideots, but even below Vermin, In&s;ects, Mites, and all the Creatures of the materi|al invi&s;ible World, even below the <HI>Exami|ner.</HI> For Nothing mu&s;t always be le&s;s than Something, let Something be never &s;o little.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t fall'n upon me with the Rage of a mad Dog or a Mohock; not becau&s;e thou had&s;t any Provocation, but becau&s;e thy Madne&s;s made thee believe that the fir&s;t thing that came in thy way, was the Cau&s;e of thy Unea&s;ine&s;s. Nothing is more certain than that I knew nothing of the Let|ter to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> till the fourteenth of this in&s;tant <HI>February,</HI> which, according to thy own Account, was five Weeks after it was publi&s;h'd. I &s;hall live to &s;ee thee cry Penny Papers, before thou
<PB N="302" REF="79">
wilt &s;ee me write them. Yet if I had writ that Paper I would boldly have own'd it, in &s;pight of thee and of all thy Abettors. What, &s;hall I be afraid or a&s;ham'd to com|mend the greate&s;t Man upon Earth, when thou art neither afraid nor a&s;ham'd mo&s;t ba&s;e|ly to calumniate him? But go on in the Cour&s;e thou art in, I cannot wi&s;h thee a greater Cur&s;e. Go on to calumniate and to vilify all that is truly great and illu&s;trious, and to flatter and to extoll all that is vile and de|&s;picable. Whatever Thoughts thou either ha&s;t, or would&s;t &s;eem to have, of me, I would have thee to know, that God and Nature have placed me infinitely above do|ing thy ba&s;e Drudgery, and being the con|temptible execrable Tool of any Party what|ever. If it be true that a Kingdom divided again&s;t it &s;elf &s;hall not &s;tand, if inte&s;tine Di|vi&s;ion be the Flaw that lets in Death to a mighty Nation, what Damnation mu&s;t that whole&s;ale Cut-throat de&s;erve, who makes it the &s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life to incen&s;e one mi&s;erable Half again&s;t the unfortunate other? Yet this I'll &s;ay for thee, that tho' thou art the wor&s;t of Murderers in thy Heart, yet Thanks to thy Impotence thy Hands are entirely free; and what <HI>Dry|den</HI> maliciou&s;ly &s;aid of <HI>Shadwell,</HI> is truly ap|plicable to none but thee.

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter I had endeavour'd to &s;hew the ab&s;urd Conduct of the Tragedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> by the <HI>Remarks</HI> which were printed by <HI>Bernard Lintott,</HI> the numerous Idoli|zers of that Tragedy, who&s;e unparallell'd Zeal was the Child of their unparallell'd Ig|norance, &s;helter'd them&s;elves under the Beauty of the Sentiments of that Poem. Up|on which I, who knew the Sentiments to be at lea&s;t as ab&s;urd as the Conduct, wrote two long Letters to a learned and judicious Friend, by which I endeavour'd to &s;hew the Sentiments as incongruous as the Con|duct. When I acquainted you with this at Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s Hou&s;e, you were pleas'd to declare, that you de&s;ir'd to &s;ee a Copy of tho&s;e Letters. And when, upon that,
<PB N="304" REF="81">
I acquainted you by what poor Artifice I had been depriv'd of the Copy of tho&s;e Letters, as my Friend had been of the O|riginal, you &s;eem'd de&s;irous to &s;ee as many of the lo&s;t Remarks as I could recollect, which, in compliance with your De&s;ires, I &s;hall &s;end you, from time to time, as I can recollect them; hoping that they may appear &s;olid to one who has &s;hewn &s;o much Ju&s;tne&s;s in all the Judgments you have made of things of this nature; but de&s;iring, at the &s;ame time, that you would not expect any thing ev'n of that little Force and that lit|tle Grace of Expre&s;&s;ion which they might have in the two foremention'd Letters, for which I have not time, and for want of which I promi&s;e to make what Amends I can, by the Solidity of my Remarks, and by the Shortne&s;s of my Letters.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I de&s;ire to know, whether the exclaiming again&s;t <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> &s;o often in this Tragedy, two Years after that Bat|tle had been fought in a different and di|&s;tant part of the World, and but two Days after the Battel of <HI>Thap&s;us,</HI> which was fought at the very Gates of <HI>Utica,</HI> and by the lo&s;s of which the pre&s;ent Danger of the People in <HI>Utica</HI> was occa&s;ion'd, is not as ab&s;urd as it would have been in the Mar|&s;hal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> to have cryed out after the Defeat at <HI>Ramelies, Blenheim, Blenheim,</HI> oh <HI>Blenheim!</HI> And we have the more rea&s;on to
<PB N="305" REF="82">
ask this Que&s;tion, if we con&s;ider that it was <HI>Pompey</HI> who commanded at <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> but it was <HI>Cato</HI> who commanded at <HI>Thap|&s;us.</HI> If any one happens to an&s;wer here, that the Defeat at <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> de&s;troy'd the Flower of the Republican Army, and con+&s;equently was the occa&s;ion of the Defeat at <HI>Thap&s;us;</HI> to that I an&s;wer, that the De|feat at <HI>Thap&s;us</HI> was not occa&s;ion'd by the Overthrow at <HI>Phar&s;alia.</HI> For at that rate much more might the Overthrow which happen'd afterwards in <HI>Spain,</HI> be attributed to the two Defeats at <HI>Thap&s;us</HI> and <HI>Phar|&s;alia;</HI> whereas 'tis very plain, that in <HI>Spain,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the two former Defeats, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Army had been defeated by young <HI>Pompey</HI>'s, if young <HI>Pompey</HI> had not been vanqui&s;h'd by <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> For it was the in|vincible Spirit of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> which got the Day, which his Army had certainly lo&s;t if they had fought under any other General. Be|&s;ides, &s;uppo&s;e that we were oblig'd to own, that the Defeat at <HI>Thap&s;us</HI> was occa&s;ion'd by that at <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> yet the Author could draw nothing from that but a fal&s;e Politick Reflection; for as great Pa&s;&s;ion is occa&s;i|on'd by great Surprize, it always dwells up|on the la&s;t Di&s;a&s;ter.

<P>TO enter into Matter without Cere|mony, I &s;hould be glad to know your Opinion of what <HI>Syphax</HI> tells <HI>Sempronius</HI> in the Beginning of the Scene between them in this fir&s;t Act.<Q>

<SPEAKER>Syph.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Sempronius,</HI> all is ready;</L>
<L>Ive &s;ounded my <HI>Numidians</HI>

Fellow-Con&s;pirator &s;hould have known it over-night, &s;ince <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was &s;o &s;oon ex|pected, and <HI>Sempronius</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems to be of that Opinion.<Q><SP>
<L>Believe me, <HI>Syphax,</HI> there's no time to wa&s;te;</L>
<L>Ev'n while we &s;peak our Conqueror comes on.</L>
<L>And gathers Ground upon us ev'ry Moment.</L>
<L>Alas! thou knowe&s;t not <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s active Soul,</L>
<L>With what a dreadful Cour&s;e he ru&s;hes on</L>
<L>From War to War. In vain has Nature form'd</L>
<L>Mountains and Oceans to oppo&s;e his Pa&s;&s;age;</L>
<L>He bounds o'er all, victorious in his March,</L>
<L>The <HI>Alpes</HI> and <HI>Pyreneans</HI> &s;ink before him,</L>
<L>Thro' Winds and Waves and Storms he works his Way,</L>
<L>Impatient for the Battel: One Day more</L>
<L>Will &s;et the Victor thundring at our Gates.</L>
</SP></Q> &s;o that according to this 'tis plain, that <HI>Sy|phax</HI> ought to have acquainted <HI>Sempronius</HI> over-night, with the Inclination which his <HI>Numidians</HI> had to revolt, provided he had &s;ounded them the Day before; and how he could &s;ound them Man by Man, by Night, in a Town of War, as <HI>Utica</HI> was, is &s;ome|thing hard to conceive. But to dwell no longer on this: If all the <HI>Numidians</HI> were thus at the Command of <HI>Syphax,</HI> how comes <HI>Sempronius</HI> &s;o earne&s;t about the gaining <HI>Juba</HI> as he is in the Remainder of this Speech?<Q><PB N="313" REF="90">

<L>This Dread of Nations, this almighty <HI>Rome,</HI></L>

<P>But, Sir, I cannot imagine, for what Rea&s;on <HI>Sempronius</HI> &s;hould appear thus &s;oli|citous for the drawing over <HI>Juba</HI> into this Con&s;piracy,<Q>

<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Come now to the Scene between <HI>Juba</HI> and <HI>Syphax,</HI> being the fourth Scene of the fir&s;t Act, which you have heard &s;o ex|travagantly commended. When I come to &s;hew you that the Author has manag'd Matters with &s;o much Dexterity, that the whole Scene is one gro&s;s Fault, that <HI>Syphax</HI> is very much in the wrong in his Invectives again&s;t the <HI>Romans,</HI> that <HI>Juba</HI> is more in the wrong in his Defence of them, what &s;hall we &s;ay of the Ta&s;te and Judgment of its Admirers? &s;hall we forbear to cry out with Indignation, <HI>Quantum e&s;t in rebus i|nane?</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then I come to &s;hew that <HI>Syphax</HI> is very much in the wrong in his general Invective again&s;t the <HI>Romans.</HI> For do but con&s;ider what the De&s;ign of <HI>Syphax</HI> was in this Conver&s;ation with <HI>Juba?</HI> his De&s;ign was to draw over <HI>Juba</HI> to the Party of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> according to the Reque&s;t which

<HI>Sempronius</HI> made him, no le&s;s than twice, in the foregoing Scene.<Q><SP>

<BIBL>p. 7. Edit. 4.</BIBL></Q> and in the next Speech but one,<Q> 
<SP>
<L>Be &s;ure to pre&s;s upon him ev'ry Motive.</L>
<L><HI>Juba's</HI> Surrender, &s;ince his Father's Death,</L>
<L>Would give up <HI>Africk</HI> into <HI>Cae&s;ar's</HI> Hands,</L>
<L>And make him Lord of half the burning Zone.</L>
</SP></Q> And as &s;oon as <HI>Syphax</HI> remains alone, he &s;ays,<Q> 
<SP>
<L>I'll try if yet I can reduce to Rea&s;on</L>
<L>This head-&s;trong Youth, and make him &s;purn at <HI>Cato.</HI></L>
<L>The Time is &s;hort, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> comes ru&s;hing on us&mdash;</L>
<L>But hold! young <HI>Juba &s;ees</HI> me, and approa|ches.</L>
</SP></Q> Now the fir&s;t Speech of <HI>Syphax,</HI> in this Scene between him and <HI>Juba,</HI> contains a general Invective again&s;t the <HI>Romans.</HI><Q><PB N="409" REF="96"><SP>
<SPEAKER>Syph.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis not my Talent to conceal my Thoughts,</L>
<L>Or carry Smiles and Sun-&s;hine in my Face,</L>
<L>When Di&s;content &s;its heavy at my Heart.</L>
<L>I have not yet &s;o much the <HI>Roman</HI> in me.</L>
</SP></Q> Now, Sir, the Que&s;tion is, whether an In|vective again&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> in general, is a probable Method to induce <HI>Juba</HI> to e&s;|pou&s;e that part of them, which either was, or at lea&s;t pa&s;s'd for, the mo&s;t profligate part of them with all the impartial World, and more particularly with <HI>Juba?</HI> The Que&s;tion is, whether an Invective again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Fraud and Hypocri&s;ie was like|ly to make <HI>Juba</HI> de&s;ert <HI>Cato,</HI> whom all the World allowed to be &s;incere, and to bring him over to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> who was renown'd for the Artifice of his Di&s;&s;imulation?</P>
<P>But as <HI>Syphax</HI> is very much in the wrong in this general Invective again&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> in general, <HI>Juba</HI>'s infinitely more &s;o in his Defence of them. For <HI>Syphax</HI> is not in the wrong ab&s;olutely, but only with relation to the De&s;ign with which he &s;peaks, for ab&s;o|lutely &s;peaking, he is &s;o far from &s;aying too much again&s;t them, that he does not &s;peak a hundredth Part of the Truth. And what <HI>Juba</HI> &s;ays in Defence of them, does by no means belong to the <HI>Romans</HI> who liv'd in <HI>Juba</HI>'s Time; but to tho&s;e who liv'd in the
<PB N="320" REF="97">
Vigour of the Common-wealth. The <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> who liv'd in <HI>Juba</HI>'s Time, were the mo&s;t profligate Race of People that ever liv'd in the World; which will ea&s;ily ap|pear by the Account that is given of their Manners by their own di&s;cerning and im|partial Hi&s;torian <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Catilinarian</HI> War. As you have the Works of that Prince of Hi&s;torians by Heart, there is no Occa&s;ion for repeating the Pa&s;&s;age. I appeal to you therefore, if 'tis not mani|fe&s;t, from the Account which <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> gives of them, that the Reflection of <HI>Syphax</HI> in the foregoing Speech is not the hundredth Part of what his Contemporary <HI>Romans</HI> de&s;erv'd, and whether it does not appear likewi&s;e from the &s;ame Account that the following Sentiments of <HI>Juba</HI> are not only fal&s;e but ba&s;e.<Q><SP>

</SP></Q> The Preheminence over other Nations to which the <HI>Romans</HI> ow'd the Extent of their Empire, did not proceed &s;o much from the &s;uperior Strength or Addre&s;s of their Individuals, con&s;ider'd as Individuals, as from their publick and military Di&s;cipline. How|ever, what <HI>Syphax</HI> &s;ays here would not be &s;o very impertinent, if the De&s;ign of <HI>Sy|phax</HI> were to draw <HI>Juba</HI> off from the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> in general; but as I &s;aid before, I cannot imagine how he can pretend by the&s;e means to draw <HI>Juba</HI> off from that Party of the <HI>Romans</HI> which he believ'd the ju&s;ter, and to make him e&s;pou&s;e that part of them, of the Ju&s;tice of who&s;e Cau&s;e he had no manner of Opinion.</P>

<P>In the following Speech, <HI>Juba</HI> pretends to convince <HI>Syphax</HI> of the Virtue of the <HI>Romans</HI> in general, I mean of the <HI>Romans</HI> who were his Contemporaries, by the Vir|tue of <HI>Cato;</HI> as if there were any Conclu|&s;ion from the Virtue of one Man to the Virtue of a whole Nation; one might as rea&s;onably conclude from the Under|&s;tanding of one Man to the Under&s;tanding of a whole Nation: one might as rea&s;ona|bly conclude that the <HI>Thebans</HI> were the brighte&s;t People of <HI>Greece,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Pindar</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="101">
was the greate&s;t of the Lyrick Poets, as that they were naturally the brave&s;t Peo|ple of <HI>Greece,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Pelopidas</HI> and <HI>E|paminondas</HI> were perhaps the greate&s;t Cap|tains of their Time. We have &s;hewn al|ready, that the <HI>Romans</HI> of tho&s;e Times were &s;o far from being more virtuous than other People, that they were more profli|gate in their Manners than any other Nati|on whatever.</P>
<P>The Virtue of <HI>Cato</HI> therefore, &s;uch as it was, mu&s;t have been owing to &s;omething el&s;e than the national Virtue of his Cotem|porary <HI>Romans.</HI> It was owing perhaps to an Affectation of the au&s;tere Virtue of his Ance&s;tors, to <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;ophy, to an o|ver-grown mon&s;trous Pride, which appears ev'ry where throughout his Character, to the Ob&s;tinacy of an inflexible Temper, and perhaps I might add to likewi&s;e invincible Ig|norance; I mean an utter Ignorance of the Condition and Con&s;titution of his Country, and of the Changes that had been made in it, by the Alteration of their Manners, by the lo&s;s of their <HI>Agrarian,</HI> and by prolon|gation of Magi&s;tracy; &s;o that the <HI>Roman</HI> Liberty in <HI>Cato</HI>'s Time was in a de&s;perate Condition, and was irretrievable unle&s;s by ab&s;olute Power.</P>
<P>It was never to be recover'd by <HI>Cato Cae&s;ar</HI> alone could re&s;t ore it. <HI>Cato</HI> had on|ly the impotent Will, but <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> alone had

the Power.

<SPEAKER>Syph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, your great Father never us'd me thus.</L>
</SP></Q> That is as much as to &s;ay, that his Father never reprimanded him for his In&s;olence and his Pre&s;umption; but &s;ee how he pro|ceeds.<Q> 
<SP>
<L>Alas! he's dead; but can you e'er forget</L>
<L>The tender Sorrow, and the Pangs of Nature,</L>
<L>The fond Embraces, and repeated Ble&s;&s;ings</L>
<L>Which you drew from him, in your la&s;t Fare|wel?</L>

<L>The good old King at parting wrung my Hand,</L>

<L>Swell'd up &s;o high, he could not utter more.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, 'tis plain from this Speech, that <HI>Syphax</HI> was pre&s;ent at the la&s;t parting be|tween the Son and the Father. Let us &s;ee now, whether <HI>Syphax</HI> can make mention of this la&s;t parting between the Son and the Father, for any other rea&s;on than to work upon the Weakne&s;s of his young Ma|&s;ter, and to put him out of his princely Sen&s;es. Not con&s;idering that the mention of that parting, if he &s;uppo&s;es his Younker had common Sen&s;e, would render the In|&s;olence and the Pre&s;umption which <HI>Syphax</HI> &s;hews, by urging <HI>Juba</HI> to abandon <HI>Cato,</HI> inexcu&s;able and in&s;upportable; becau&s;e at that parting, at which we have ju&s;t now &s;hewn that <HI>Syphax</HI> was pre&s;ent, the Father &s;trictly charges the Son never to abandon <HI>Cato.</HI></P>
<P>This is evident from what <HI>Juba</HI> &s;ays in the Scene between him and <HI>Cato</HI> in the &s;e|cond Act, where <HI>Juba</HI> gives the other a Relation of what happen'd at the la&s;t part|ing between his Father and him&s;elf in the following Words.<Q><PB N="329" REF="106"> 
<SP>
<L>My Father, when, &s;ome Days before his Death,</L>
<L>He order'd me to march to <HI>Utica,</HI></L>
<L>(Alas, I thought not then his Death &s;o near!)</L>
<L>Wept o'er me, pre&s;s'd me in his aged Arms,</L>
<L>And as his Grief gave way, My Son, &s;aid he,</L>
<L>Whatever Fortune &s;hall befall thy Father,</L>
<L>Be <HI>Cato</HI>'s Friend, he'll train thee up to great</L>
<L>And virtuous Deeds: Do but ob&s;erve him well,</L>
<L>Thou'lt &s;hun Misfortunes, or thou'lt learn to bear them.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But now the Son in this Scene between him and <HI>Syphax</HI> in the fir&s;t Act, upon the Mention which <HI>Syphax</HI> makes of this Par|ting, &s;eems entirely to have forgot that Ad|monition of his Father, of which he makes &s;o circum&s;tantial a Relation to <HI>Cato</HI> in the 2d Act. To be convinc'd of this, let us &s;ee what he an&s;wers to what <HI>Syphax</HI> &s;aid la&s;t to him.<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Juba.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas, thy Story melts away my Soul!</L>

<L>That Gratitude and Duty which I owe him?</L>

<L>His Coun&s;els bad me yield to thy Directions.</L>

What? when tho&s;e Directions were point blank contrary to his own, as they appa|rently are here? But what follows?<Q>

<SPEAKER>Juba.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Syphax,</HI> I've promis'd to pre&s;erve my Temper;</L>
<L>Why wilt thou urge me to confe&s;s a Flame</L>
<L>I long have &s;tifled, and would fain conceal.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, I de&s;ire to know how <HI>Syphax</HI> and <HI>Sempronius</HI> &s;hould come to know of this Flame, if <HI>Juba</HI> had long &s;tifled it, and would fain conceal it. For as <HI>Sempronius</HI> tells us in the third Act, no one had Ac|ce&s;s to <HI>Marcia</HI> but <HI>Juba</HI> and her Brothers. And if <HI>Juba</HI> had never confe&s;s'd any Pa&s;&s;i|on, the Brothers &s;ure would not talk of any &s;uch thing, before they were certain of it, tho' perhaps they might have gue&s;s'd at it; and certain they could not be, before the Declaration of <HI>Juba.</HI></P>
<P>For what remains, tho' this Character of <HI>Juba</HI> is not &s;o faulty with relation to the Rules, as &s;ome which I mentioned in the <HI>Remarks</HI> which were formerly publi&s;h'd by <HI>Lintott,</HI> yet is it more faulty, ab&s;olutely and con&s;ider'd in it &s;elf. For <HI>Juba</HI> is a Character that is not only &s;hocking and contemptible to Men of Sen&s;e, at the &s;ame time that the Author endeavours to render him e&s;timable and agreeable, but he is &s;hock|ing and contemptible by the very &s;ame Qua|lities by which the Author endeavours to render him e&s;timable and agreeable, and the&s;e are his E&s;teem and Admiration of <HI>Cato</HI> and of the <HI>Romans.</HI> For in admiring
<PB N="332" REF="109">
the <HI>Romans</HI> who were his Contemporaries, he not only admir'd the mo&s;t profligately wicked of all Nations, as we have &s;hewn above by the Te&s;timony of their noble&s;t Hi&s;torian, but a Nation who, in their Pro|gre&s;s to univer&s;al Monarchy, were about to ruin and en&s;lave <HI>Numidia,</HI> and the re&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> as they had done <HI>Europe</HI> and part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> before. And as to that E&s;teem and Veneration and almo&s;t Adoration which he &s;hews for <HI>Cato,</HI> we have this one Remark to make; that he thinks and acts directly coun|ter to him, even in tho&s;e very Qualities for which he pretends to admire him. For the mo&s;t &s;hining Qualities in <HI>Cato</HI>'s Character were the Love of his Country, and the Com|mand which he had of his Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, for the fir&s;t of the&s;e Qualities give me leave to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Cato</HI> was a Lover of his own Country, and not of <HI>Nu|midia;</HI> and he and his <HI>Romans</HI> de&s;ign'd to &s;ubdue <HI>Numidia</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> and not <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Numidia.</HI> If <HI>Syphax</HI> had been a loyal Subject and a true Friend to his Prince, and not a fal&s;e Traitor and a Friend to <HI>Rome,</HI> he would have advis'd his Prince to have defied both <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Cato,</HI> and the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> in general, and taking this Advan|tage of their civil Di&s;&s;en&s;ions to have re|treated into his own <HI>Numidia,</HI> and to have rows'd up all the Nations between the Tro|picks again&s;t tho&s;e accur&s;ed Plagues of Hu|man
<PB N="333" REF="110">
Race, who de&s;ign'd to &s;acrifice the Happine&s;s and the Virtue of Mankind to their in&s;atiable Avarice, and their dete&s;ta|ble Ambition. And <HI>Juba</HI> had follow'd that Advice, if he had been wi&s;e or magnani|mous enough to have had any Regard for his own Royalty and his Independency, or had been a true Patriot enough to have had half &s;o much concern for the Liberty and Happine&s;s of <HI>Numidia</HI> as <HI>Cato</HI> had for that of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Now as for the other Quality of <HI>Cato,</HI> the Command of his Pa&s;&s;ions; <HI>Juba</HI> is &s;o far from commanding his own, that thro' an unparallell'd Impotence of Mind, he chu&s;es that very Day to make a Declarati|on of his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Marcia,</HI> and to gain her Father's Con&s;ent, which is apprehended to be the very la&s;t both of <HI>Roman</HI> Liberty, and of her Father's Life. And this Weakne&s;s of his is expo&s;ed the more, and render'd the more contemptible ev'n by what <HI>Por|tius</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Marcus</HI> in his Prai&s;e in the fir&s;t Scene of the Play.<Q> 
<SP>
<L>Behold young <HI>Juba</HI> the <HI>Numidian</HI> Prince,</L>
<L>With how much Care he forms him&s;elf to Glory,</L>
<L>And breaks the Fiercene&s;s of his native Tem|per,</L>
<L>To copy out our Father's bright Example.</L>
<L>He loves our Si&s;ter <HI>Martia,</HI> greatly loves her!</L>
<L><PB N="334" REF="111"> His Eyes, his Looks, his Actions all betray it.</L>
<L>But &s;till the &s;mother'd Fondne&s;s burns with|in him.</L>

<L>The &s;en&s;e of Honour and de&s;ire of Fame</L>

</SP></Q> So that <HI>Juba,</HI> it &s;eems, after having for &s;ome time &s;tifled his Pa&s;&s;ion, chu&s;es that very Day to declare and divulge it, on which Rea&s;on and Decency oblig'd him mo&s;t of all to conceal it.</P>
<P>By the way, Sir, I de&s;ire leave to ob&s;erve, that for <HI>Portius</HI> to declare that <HI>Juba</HI> loves his Si&s;ter <HI>Marcia,</HI> and not only loves her, but greatly loves her; that his Eyes, that his Looks, that his Actions all betray that Love, that tho' he is &s;ilent the &s;mother'd Fonde&s;s burns within him, even when it labours mo&s;t for a Vent, and that he is re|&s;train'd from divulging it, by the &s;en&s;e of Honour and the de&s;ire of Fame, I &s;ay, for <HI>Portius</HI> to declare all this, when it appears that <HI>Juba</HI> has not only made no mention of it before that Day, but declares it upon the on|ly Day in which the &s;en&s;e of Honour and de&s;ire of Fame forbid &s;uch a Declaration, are Sentiments that appear to me to be vi|&s;ionary and fanta&s;tick. It &s;eeming to me to be equally &s;elf-evident, that nothing could make &s;uch a Declaration in <HI>Juba</HI> di&s;honour|able before that Day, and that nothing could

<P>YOU could not have us'd a more pre|vailing Argument to oblige me to con|tinue my Remarks upon the Sentiments of <HI>Cato,</HI> than the a&s;&s;uring me that tho&s;e which I have already &s;ent you upon the Sentiments of the fir&s;t Act have not been di&s;plea&s;ing to you.

In order to the an&s;wering this Que&s;tion, let us con&s;ider the De&s;ign, with which <HI>Cato,</HI> who pre&s;ides o'er it, &s;ummon'd this A&s;&s;embly. Let us con&s;ider next the Manner of &s;peaking in it, and la&s;tly the Speeches them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="114">
The De&s;ign of <HI>Cato</HI> is to con&s;ult this A&s;|&s;embly about Peace or War; which he does, without &s;o much as once con&s;ulting them, about the Means of carrying it on, or &s;o much as once asking their Advice a|bout it. And yet <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was expected in a few Hours at the Gates of <HI>Utica,</HI> a Town not maintainable again&s;t <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Army, as we may learn by the very fir&s;t Lines of the Play.<Q>

<P>But, Sir, let us con&s;ider the Manner of &s;peaking in this A&s;&s;embly. As &s;oon as <HI>Ca|to</HI> propo&s;es the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Peace or War, <HI>Sempronius</HI> ri&s;es, and declares for the latter; when <HI>Cato</HI> immediately contradicts him without &s;taying to &s;ee if the re&s;t of the Se|nators were of his Opinion; which is con|trary to the Method of all Councils, either tho&s;e of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> or tho&s;e of the World, becau&s;e &s;uch a Proceeding is not con&s;onant to Rea&s;on nor to the De&s;ign of convening &s;uch A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="115">
For the very De&s;ign of convening &s;uch A&s;&s;emblies, and of asking their Advice, is, that every Man who is ask'd it, &s;hould give it &s;incerely and without Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Now is it not plain, Sir, that if he who has the &s;upream Authority in a Council de|clares his Opinion before the re&s;t, they who &s;peak after him are in &s;ome mea&s;ure bya&s;s'd?</P>

<P>We will begin to examine this Speech by the Tayl; for 'tis not till the four la&s;t Lines that <HI>Cato</HI> puts the Que&s;tion to this mock Senate, whether they were for Peace or War, which is putting a wrong Que&s;tion. For as long as they had a Re&s;&s;ource, and the Affairs of the Commonwealth were not de|&s;perate, as appears by what <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Juba</HI> &s;ay in the &s;equel, all true Patriots ought to be for War; and the only Que&s;tion which could be put properly to them, was, &s;ince <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> approached, and <HI>Utica</HI> was not main|tainable by their Forces, again&s;t his nume|rous and victorious Army, to what Places they &s;hould immediately retreat, and where they might be&s;t and &s;oone&s;t recruit their Forces. All the fir&s;t part of the Speech is Declamation, and telling his Hearers, tho' neither he nor they had a Minute to lo&s;e, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> being expected every Hour, what either was not true, or what they mu&s;t e|very one of them know every Jot as well as him&s;elf.

<PB N="341" REF="118">
<HI>Sempronius</HI> is wrong, becau&s;e the Forces in <HI>Utica</HI> could before the Arrival of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> make a Retreat and recruit. But after Re|fu&s;al to make Peace and to make a Retreat, there remain'd but two things, either to go out and fight, or to &s;tay there till they were coop'd up by <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> To &s;tay there was fooli&s;h and de&s;perate; for <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> might be certain to reduce them by Famine, without &s;uffering them &s;o much as to &s;trike a Stroke.

<SP>
<L>Perhaps &s;ome Arm, more lucky than the re&s;t,</L>

</SP></Q> Why no: The World could not with rea|&s;on &s;ay, that he lavi&s;h'd at his Death the Blood of thou&s;ands, for doing a rea&s;on|able thing, that is by leading them out to fight again&s;t the Enemies of their Country, by which they had a Chance for the Victo|ry, after he had re&s;olv'd within him&s;elf neither to make Peace nor retreat.

<L>He lavi&s;h'd at his Death the Blood of thou|&s;ands</L>

</SP></Q> by ba&s;ely de&s;erting them; that is, by dying alone, by dying by his own Hand, with|out making a fair Retreat with them, or making any Terms for them, or fighting bravely at the Head of them.

<P>But now, Sir, as <HI>Sempronius</HI> is in the wrong in declaring for War, before he knew that <HI>Cato</HI> had re&s;olv'd neither to make Peace nor make a Retreat; as <HI>Cato</HI> is more in the wrong in an&s;wering him; let us now &s;hew that <HI>Lucius</HI> is &s;till more in the wrong in the Harangue which he makes for Peace; and <HI>Cato</HI> &s;till more in the wrong than he, in the An&s;wer which he makes to that Ha|rangue.<Q><SP>

</SP></Q> Thus is this Fool in the other Extream, as if there were no medium, between urging the Foe to immediate Battel, and a ba&s;e Submi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Cato</HI> will tell him in his An|&s;wer that there is that medium, but will tell it him after &s;uch a manner, that he had better have &s;aid nothing.<Q><SP>

<L>Fathers, I cannot &s;ee that our Af|fairs</L>
<L>Are grown thus de&s;p'rate. We have Bul|warks round us;</L>
<L>Within our Walls are Troops enured to Toil</L>

<L>Ready to ri&s;e at its young Prince's Call.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P> Thus <HI>Cato</HI> is &s;en&s;ible, that there is a me|dium between urging the Foe to immedi|ate Battel, and a ba&s;e Submi&s;&s;ion. There is a retreat into <HI>Numidia,</HI> where they may repair and recruit their Forces, and then
<PB N="346" REF="123">
it will be time to offer Battel, and there|fore this Stoick ju&s;tly cries out,<Q><SP>
<L>While there is Hope, do not di&s;tru&s;t the Gods.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But what Inference does he draw from hence? why, the &s;trange&s;t one in the World.<Q><SP>
<L>While there is Hope, do not di&s;tru&s;t the Gods;</L>
<L>But wait at lea&s;t till <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s near Approach</L>

</SP></Q> That is as much as to &s;ay, Since we have &s;o fair a Retreat into <HI>Numidia,</HI> who&s;e &s;pa|cious Kingdom does as it were extend its Arms to receive us; why in the Name of all the Gods e'en let us &s;tay here. But let us &s;uffer him to go on,<Q> 
<SP>
<L>'Twill never he too late</L>
<L>To &s;ue for Chains, and own a Conqueror.</L>
<L>Why &s;hould <HI>Rome</HI> fall a Moment ere her time?</L>
<L>No, let us draw her Term of Freedom out</L>
<L>In its full Length, and &s;pin it to the la&s;t.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But now, Sir, is that the way to &s;pin the Freedom of <HI>Rome</HI> to the la&s;t, to &s;tay till they are coop'd up in <HI>Utica,</HI> in&s;tead of retreating into <HI>Numidia,</HI> where they may rai&s;e another Army, with which they may

once more contend for the Liberties of their Country. But let him make an end of this ble&s;&s;ed Harangue.<Q><SP>
<L>So &s;hall we gain &s;till one Day's Liberty;</L>
<L>And let me peri&s;h, but, in <HI>Cato</HI>'s Judgment,</L>
<L>A Day, an Hour of virtuous Liberty,</L>
<L>Is worth a whole Eternity in Bondage.</L>
</SP></Q> Why let it be &s;o; but then if a Day, if an Hour of virtuous Liberty be of &s;uch im|men&s;e Value, &s;ure an Age, or many Ages of it are infinitely more to be e&s;teem'd. And why they &s;hould talk of adding a Day to the Liberties of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they may rea&s;onably hope to add whole Ages, by retreating into a va&s;t Kingdom, which lyes open to receive them, is I mu&s;t confe&s;s above my Apprehen&s;ion.</P>

more be in a Condition of contending for the Liberties of <HI>Rome,</HI> and of Mankind; yet rather than make this Retreat, which may look little in the Eyes of the unthink|ing Part of the World; I, who pretend &s;o much concern for my Friends, and &s;o much Love for my Country, will rather &s;uffer my Country to &s;ink, and my Friends to peri&s;h.

</SP></Q> <PB N="350" REF="127">
Did not the Great <HI>Pompey</HI> wander more like a Vagabond from <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> being accompanied but by few, as Vaga|bonds are often accompanied? whereas <HI>Cato</HI> might be attended by Thou&s;ands, by all the remains of the Forces in <HI>Utica,</HI> who&s;e Lives he might &s;ecure by his Re|treat, and who&s;e Deaths he would certain|ly lavi&s;h by his Stay.

Secretary at WAR.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN Addre&s;s of this nature, made upon your Advancement to one of the prin|cipal Employments of the State, and made by one who has had the Honour to be known to you &s;o many Years, might be pretended by malicious People to be a Homage rather to your Fortune and Power, than a due Re|&s;pect to your Merit and Virtue; if it were not publickly known, that I formerly applied my &s;elf to you in the &s;ame manner, when you were much more di&s;tingui&s;hed by Merit and Virtue, than by Fortune and Power.</P>
<P>But if any one farther maliciou&s;ly urges, that, even when I formerly applied my &s;elf to you, by the di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualities of your Mind and Per&s;on, I fore&s;aw your Fortune and Power; to him I an&s;wer, in order to vindicate the Reputation of my Sincerity and my Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, that tho' I &s;aw
<PB REF="139">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="140">
very well that tho&s;e great Qualities fitted Mr. <HI>Granville</HI> for the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Em|ployments; yet who could have ever ima|gin'd that any Man living had Merit enough to rai&s;e him in &s;pight of &s;o many unfortunate Virtues with which that Merit was attended, in &s;pight of not only a true Poetical Genius, but a Frankne&s;s, a Probity, a matchle&s;s In|tegrity, a Sincerity worthy of Heroick Times, and a mo&s;t untainted Honour?</P>
<P>But tho' your Character were le&s;s con&s;pi|cuous, and what I had formerly done were intirely forgot, the numerous and powerful Obligations I have to you, would more than ju&s;tify this Addre&s;s; and the omitting the fir&s;t Opportunity of making you a publick Acknowledgment would look like black In|gratitude. You have taken &s;uch Care of my Intere&s;t with others at a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable Conjuncture, and have your &s;elf made me a Pre&s;ent &s;o noble, and &s;o extraordinary, at a time when I &s;tood mo&s;t in need of it, that how few alive have Spirit and Magnanimi|ty to do any thing like it? At lea&s;t I defy any one to name that living Man, who in a private Capacity has done any thing like it.</P>
<P>I know very well indeed that you are very far from de&s;iring &s;uch a publick Acknow|ledgment, that you aim at nothing by doing daily good, but the God-like Plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from your Actions; and that others
<PB REF="141">
perhaps may cen&s;ure me for &s;acrificing your Mode&s;ty to my own Vanity. For to publi&s;h to the World that I have been oblig'd in an extraordinary manner by a Per&s;on &s;o uni|ver&s;ally e&s;teem'd and di&s;tingui&s;h'd, that one of the very few Things in which the mo&s;t violent of both Parties agree, is the Cha|racter of Mr. <HI>Granville,</HI> will be thought to be the Re&s;ult of uncommon Vanity, by tho&s;e who have not Goodne&s;s enough to be|lieve it to be the Effect of a lively Gratitude.</P>
<P>But tho', Sir, I had no Obligation to you, and you had no other Merit but that of per|fectly under&s;tanding an Art which you have perfectly practis'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the Art which is the Subject of the following Treati&s;e, that Trea|ti&s;e would be by Right of Nature yours. For to whom can an E&s;&s;ay upon the Genius and Writings of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> be &s;o properly ad|dre&s;s'd, as to him who be&s;t under&s;tands <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and who has mo&s;t improv'd him? I would not give this ju&s;t Enco|mium to the <HI>Jew of Venice,</HI> if I were not convinc'd from a long Experience of the Penetration and Force of your Judgment, that no Exaltation can make you a&s;ham'd of your former noble Art; that you know it to be a Weakne&s;s barely to imagine, that the mo&s;t noble and mo&s;t exalted of all Arts, and the mo&s;t difficult to excel in, can render a Man le&s;s qualified for publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, or
<PB REF="142">
for the fir&s;t Employments of the State; that all the great State&s;men who have be&s;t &s;uc|ceeded in Affairs of Government, have ei|ther writ Poems, or Treati&s;es concerning Poetry. The mo&s;t ancient of Hi&s;torians and Legi&s;lators, <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> at lea&s;t of tho&s;e who&s;e Laws and Hi&s;tories remain, has given us a pathetick and a lofty Poem upon the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athenian</HI> Legi&s;lator <HI>Solon</HI> thought it not in the lea&s;t below his Dignity to render Moral Virtue lovely by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of Ver&s;e. And <HI>Lacedemonian Lycurgus,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the ri|gid and the au&s;tere <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> thought it an Employment worthy of his Wi&s;dom ana Virtue, to re&s;tore and publi&s;h the immortal Works of <HI>Homer:</HI> Having the &s;ame Opi|nion of that Prince of Poets that <HI>Horace</HI> afterwards had; that his Poems would bet|ter in&s;truct Mankind in Virtue than they could be po&s;&s;ibly taught by Pro&s;e. The mo&s;t illu&s;trious Writers of Politicks among the <HI>Grecians, Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> one of them had a figurative, a lofty and a Poetick Pro&s;e; and the other, who may be call'd the Legi&s;lator of<HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> wrote the Laws of Tragedy &s;o exactly and &s;o truly in Rea&s;on and Nature, that &s;ucceeding Criticks have writ ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably upon that Art no farther than they have adhered to their great Ma|&s;ter's Notions. <HI>Tacitus,</HI> the very Oracle of
<PB REF="143">
Modern State&s;men, has a Stile that is warm, and daring, and figurative, that is to &s;ay Poetick. <HI>Machiavel</HI> the Prince of Modern Politicians, if we except but one of our own Country-men, wrote more than one Co|medy; and more than one Poem has been attempted by our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Politician <HI>Har|rington.</HI> The two Princes of Poets may ea&s;ily be proved to've been great State&s;men; <HI>Homer</HI> particularly made choice of a Mo|ral, which in his Time, when <HI>Greece</HI> with the I&s;lands of the <HI>Aegaean</HI> was divided into petty Sovereignties, was the fundamental Maxim of their Politicks and their true Intere&s;t; which Moral was, as <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> af|terwards expre&s;s'd it, <HI>Concordi&acirc; res par|vae cre&s;cunt, Di&s;cordi&acirc; maxima dilabun|tur;</HI> from who&s;e noble&s;t Poem you formerly gave us a Tragedy, in which, in Imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> you are daring yet ju&s;t, fiery yet regular, &s;ublime yet natural and per&s;pi|cuous, cha&s;t yet alluring, and ea&s;ie yet &s;trong and powerful.</P>
<P>But to come to the more active Part of Government, the greate&s;t Monarchs and Captains and Mini&s;ters of State that ever were known in the World, either were or would have been great Poets. When <HI>Athens</HI> flouri&s;h'd in all her Glory, their Poets and their famous Writers were they who di|rected their Coun&s;els, and led their Armies
<PB REF="144">
to Battel. <HI>Alexander</HI> read nothing but the Works of <HI>Homer</HI> while he conquer'd the Orient. In <HI>Rome,</HI> the greate&s;t Captain that flouri&s;h'd in the Time of the Common|wealth vouch&s;afed his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to a Co|mick Poet: And the two fir&s;t <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> were proud to write Tragedies with tho&s;e fatal Hands that were victorious over the Univer&s;e. <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> at the Time that he was fir&s;t Mini&s;ter to the Emperor of the World, was not only the greate&s;t Patron of the Mu&s;es that ever was, but endeavour'd to be him&s;elf a Poet. If we de&s;cend to Mordern Times, <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who laid the Foundation of the <HI>French</HI> Greatne&s;s, wrote more than one Dramatick Poem, with that very right Hand which dictated to the Ca|binets of &s;o many Sovereign Princes, and directed the &s;ucce&s;sful Motions of &s;o many conquering Commanders. And that Great|ne&s;s, which upon a <HI>French</HI> Poetick Foun|dation was in the Space of le&s;s than one Century rais'd to an in&s;upportable Height, was in le&s;s than twenty Years &s;app'd and undermin'd and overturn'd by a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Poetick Mini&s;try: It being undeniable, that &s;everal of the Per&s;ons who made the chief Figures in both the old and the new Mini&s;try were Poets. I make no doubt, Sir, but the time will come when you will be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the
<PB REF="145">
Wi&s;dom and Reach of your Coun&s;els, as much as you were formerly by the Spirit and Ju&s;tne&s;s of your Writings. For the very Virtues which we once were afraid would hinder your Advancement even in the mo&s;t virtuous Court, are now like to pre&s;erve and &s;upport your Intere&s;t &s;ince you have had an Opportunity of publickly practi&s;ing them &s;o long. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to behold that Ar|dor, that Sincerity and that Alacrity, with which you every Day endeavour to do good to your Fellow-Creatures, without loving you, and without wi&s;hing, as well as hop|ing, that you may be the peculiar Care of Providence, which by advancing you to one of the mo&s;t eminent Stations would pro|vide for Thou&s;ands. But when we behold that Ardor, and that Alacrity, attended with &s;uch an attractive Sweetne&s;s, and &s;uch a manly Grace, and with a Nobility which God and Nature &s;eem to have im|printed both on your Mind and Per&s;on, we have no longer Power over our &s;elves, but give up all our Affections to you; and not only wi&s;h, but firmly believe that &s;ince God and Nature have given you tho&s;e &s;everal Excellencies which were the undoubted O|riginal of all Political Nobility, they have determin'd you to &s;ucceed to the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive Fortunes and Titles of your Noble An|ce&s;tors;

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 1.
1710/11.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I Here &s;end you the Tragedy of <HI>Corio|lanus,</HI> which I have alter'd from the Original of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and with it a &s;hort Account of the Genius and Writings of that Author, both which you de&s;ired me to &s;end to you the la&s;t time I had the good For|tune to &s;ee you. But I &s;end them both upon this condition, that you will with your u&s;ual Sincerity tell me your Sentiments both of the Poem and of the Critici&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was one of the greate&s;t Ge|nius's that the World e'er &s;aw for the Tra|gick Stage. Tho' he lay under greater Di&s;|advantages than any of his Succe&s;&s;ors, yet had he greater and more genuine Beauties than the be&s;t and greate&s;t of them. And what makes the brighte&s;t Glory of his Cha|racter,
<PB N="372" REF="148">
tho&s;e Beauties were entirely his own, and owing to the Force of his own Nature; whereas his Faults were owing to his Edu|cation, and to the Age that he liv'd in. One may &s;ay of him as they did of <HI>Homer,</HI> that he had none to imitate, and is him&s;elf inimi|table. His Imaginations were often as ju&s;t, as they were bold and &s;trong. He had a na|tural Di&s;cretion which never cou'd have been taught him, and his Judgment was &s;trong and penetrating. He &s;eems to have wanted nothing but Time and Lei&s;ure for Thought, to have found out tho&s;e Rules of which he appears &s;o ignorant. His Cha|racters are always drawn ju&s;tly, exactly, graphically, except where he fail'd by not knowing Hi&s;tory or the Poetical Art. He has for the mo&s;t part more fairly di&s;tingui&s;h'd them than any of his Succe&s;&s;ors have done, who have fal&s;ified them, or confounded them, by making Love the predominant Quality in all. He had &s;o fine a Talent for touching the Pa&s;&s;ions, and they are &s;o lively in him, and &s;o truly in Nature, that they often touch us more without their due Preparations, than tho&s;e of other Tragick Poets, who have all the Beauty of De&s;ign and all the Advantage of Incidents. Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ma&s;ter-Pa&s;&s;ion was Terror, which he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> often mov'd &s;o powerfully and &s;o wonder|fully, that we may ju&s;tly conclude, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had had the Advantage of Art and Learn+ing
<PB N="373" REF="149">
he wou'd have &s;urpa&s;s'd the very be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of the Ancients. His Paint|ings are often &s;o beautiful and &s;o lively, &s;o graceful and &s;o powerful, e&s;pecially where he u&s;es them in order to move Terror; that there is nothing perhaps more accom|pli&s;h'd in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry. His Senti|ments for the mo&s;t part in his be&s;t Trage|dies, are noble, generous, ea&s;ie and natural, and adapted to the Per&s;ons who u&s;e them. His Expre&s;&s;ion is in many Places good and pure after a hundred Years; &s;imple tho' elevated, graceful tho' bold, and ea&s;ie tho' &s;trong. He &s;eems to have been the very Original of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragical Harmo|ny; that is the Harmony of Blank Ver&s;e, diver&s;ifyed often by Di&s;&s;yllable and Tri&s;&s;yl|lable Terminations. For that Diver&s;ity di&s;tingui&s;hes it from Heroick Harmony, and bringing it nearer to common U&s;e, makes it more proper to gain Attention, and more fit for Action and Dialogue. Such Ver&s;e we make when we are writing Pro&s;e; we make &s;uch Ver&s;e in common Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had the&s;e great Qualities by Nature, what would he not have been, if he had join'd to &s;o happy a Genius Learning and the Poetical Art. For want of the lat|ter, our Author has &s;ometimes made gro&s;s Mi&s;takes in the Characters which he has drawn from Hi&s;tory, again&s;t the Equality
<PB N="374" REF="150">
and Conveniency of Manners of his Drama|tical Per&s;ons. Witne&s;s <HI>Menenius</HI> in the fol|lowing Tragedy, whom he has made an er|rant Buffoon, which is a great Ab&s;urdity. For he might as well have imagin'd a grave maje&s;tick <HI>Jack-Pudding,</HI> as a Buffoon in a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator. <HI>Aufidius</HI> the General of the <HI>Vol&s;cians</HI> is &s;hewn a ba&s;e and a profligate Villain. He has offended again&s;t the Equa|lity of the Manners even in his Hero him|&s;elf. For <HI>Coriolanus</HI> who in the fir&s;t part of the Tragedy is &s;hewn &s;o open, &s;o frank, &s;o violent, and &s;o magnanimous, is repre&s;ented in the latter part by <HI>Aufidius,</HI> which is con|tradicted by no one, a flattering, fawning, cringing, in&s;inuating Traytor.</P>
<P>For want of this Poetical Art, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has introduced things into his Tragedies, which are again&s;t the Dignity of that noble Poem, as the Rabble in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and that in <HI>Coriolanus;</HI> tho' that in <HI>Coriolanus</HI> offends not only again&s;t the Dignity of Tragedy, but again&s;t the Truth of Hi&s;tory likewi&s;e, and the Cu&s;toms of Ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Roman</HI> People, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;hew anon.</P>
<P>For want of this Art, he has made his Incidents le&s;s moving, le&s;s &s;urprizing, and le&s;s wonderful. He has been &s;o far from &s;eeking tho&s;e fine Occa&s;ions to move with which an Action furni&s;h'd according to Art would have furni&s;h'd him; that he
<PB N="375" REF="151">
&s;eems rather to have indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided them. He makes <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> upon his Sen|tence of Bani&s;hment, take his leave of his Wife and his Mother out of &s;ight of the Audience, and &s;o has purpo&s;ely as it were avoided a great occa&s;ion to move.</P>
<P>If we are willing to allow, that <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> by &s;ticking to the bare Events of Hi|&s;tory, has mov'd more than any of his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, yet his ju&s;t Admirers mu&s;t confe&s;s, that if he had had the Poetical Art, he would have mov'd ten times more. For 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that by a bare Hi&s;torical Play he could move &s;o much as he would have done by a Fable.</P>
<P>We find that a Romance entertains the generality of Mankind with more Sati&s;|faction than Hi&s;tory, if they read only to be entertain'd; but if they read Hi&s;tory thro' Pride or Ambition, they bring their Pa&s;&s;ions along with them, and that alters the ca&s;e. Nothing is more plain than that even in an Hi&s;torical Relation &s;ome Parts of it, and &s;ome Events, plea&s;e more than others. And therefore a Man of Judg|ment, who &s;ees why they do &s;o, may in forming a Fable, and di&s;po&s;ing an Action, plea&s;e more than an Hi&s;torian can do. For the ju&s;t Fiction of a Fable moves us more than an Hi&s;torical Relation can do, for the two following Rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, by rea&s;on of the Communication and mutual Depen|dence
<PB N="376" REF="152">
of its Parts. For if Pa&s;&s;ion &s;prings from Motion, then the Ob&s;truction of that Motion or a counter Motion mu&s;t ob&s;truct and check the Pa&s;&s;ion: And therefore an Hi&s;torian and a Writer of Hi&s;torical Plays pa&s;&s;ing from Events of one nature to Events of another nature without a due Preparati|on, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;tifle and confound one Pa&s;&s;ion by another. The &s;econd Rea|&s;on why the Fiction of a Fable plea&s;es us more, than an Hi&s;torical Relation can do, is, becau&s;e in an Hi&s;torical Relation we &s;eldom are acquainted with the true Cau&s;es of Events, whereas in a feign'd Action which is duly con&s;tituted, that is, which has a ju&s;t beginning, tho&s;e Cau&s;es always appear. For 'tis ob&s;ervable, that both in a Poetical Fiction and an Hi&s;torical Rela|tion, tho&s;e Events are the mo&s;t entertain|ing, the mo&s;t &s;urprizing, and the mo&s;t wonderful, in which Providence mo&s;t plainly appears. And 'tis for this Rea&s;on that the Author of a ju&s;t Fable, mu&s;t plea&s;e more than the Writer of an Hi&s;torical Relation. The Good mu&s;t never fail to pro&s;per, and the Bad mu&s;t be always pu|ni&s;h'd: Otherwi&s;e the Incidents, and par|ticularly the Cata&s;trophe which is the grand Incident, are liable to be imputed ra|ther to Chance, than to Almighty Conduct and to Sovereign Ju&s;tice. The want of this impartial Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice makes the
<PB N="377" REF="153">
<HI>Coriolanus</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to be without Mo|ral. 'Tis true indeed <HI>Coriolanus</HI> is kill'd by tho&s;e Foreign Enemies with whom he had openly &s;ided again&s;t his Country, which &s;eems to be an Event worthy of Providence, and would look as if it were contriv'd by in|finite Wi&s;dom, and executed by &s;upreme Ju&s;tice, to make <HI>Coriolanus</HI> a dreadful Exam|ple to all who lead on Foreign Enemies to the Inva&s;ion of their native Country; if there were not &s;omething in the Fate of the other Characters, which gives occa&s;ion to doubt of it, and which &s;ugge&s;ts to the Scep|tical Reader that this might happen by acci|dent. For <HI>Au&s;idius</HI> the principal Murderer of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> who in cold Blood gets him a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Ruffians, in&s;tead of leaving him to the Law of the Country, and the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Vol&s;cian</HI> Senate, and who com|mits &s;o black a Crime, not by any erroneous Zeal, or a mi&s;taken publick Spirit, but thro' Jealou&s;y, Envy, and inveterate Malice; this A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inator not only &s;urvives, and &s;urvives unpuni&s;h'd, but &s;eems to be rewarded for &s;o dete&s;table an Action; by engro&s;&s;ing all tho&s;e Honours to him&s;elf which <HI>Coriolanus</HI> before had &s;har'd with him. But not only <HI>Au&s;idius,</HI> but the <HI>Roman</HI> Tribunes, <HI>Sicinius</HI> and <HI>Brutus,</HI> appear to me to cry aloud for Poetick Vengeance. For they are guilty of two Faults, neither of which ought to go unpuni&s;h'd: The fir&s;t in procuring the Ba|ni&s;hment
<PB N="378" REF="154">
of <HI>Coriolanus.</HI> If they were really jealous, that <HI>Coriolanus</HI> had a De&s;ign on their Liberties, when he &s;tood for the Con&s;ul&s;hip, it was but ju&s;t that they &s;hould give him a Repul&s;e; but to get the Champion and De|fender of their Country bani&s;h'd upon a pre|tended Jealou&s;y was a great deal too much, and could proceed from nothing but that Hatred and Malice which they had conceiv'd again&s;t him, for oppo&s;ing their In&s;titution. Their &s;econd Fault lay in procuring this Sentence by indirect Methods, by exa&s;pera|ting and inflaming the People by Artifices and In&s;inuations, by taking a ba&s;e Advan|tage of the Open-heartedne&s;s and Violence of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> and by oppre&s;&s;ing him with a So|phi&s;tical Argument, that he aim'd at Sove|reignty, becau&s;e he had not delivered into the Publick Trea&s;ury the Spoils which he had taken from the <HI>Antiates.</HI> As if a De|&s;ign of Sovereignty could be rea&s;onably con|cluded from any one Act; or any one could think of bringing to pa&s;s &s;uch a De&s;ign, by eternally favouring the Patricians, and di&s;o|bliging the Populace. For we need make no doubt, but that it was among the young Pa|tricians that <HI>Coriolanus</HI> di&s;tributed the Spoils which were taken from the <HI>Antiates;</HI> where|as nothing but care&s;&s;ing the Populace could en&s;lave the <HI>Roman</HI> People, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> after|wards very well &s;aw and experienc'd. So that this Inju&s;tice of the Tribunes was the

original Cau&s;e of the Calamity which after|wards befel their Country, by the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Vol&s;cians,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Co|riolanus.</HI> And yet the&s;e Tribunes at the end of the Play, like <HI>Aufidius,</HI> remain unpuni&s;h'd. But indeed <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has been wanting in the exact Di&s;tribution of Poetical Ju&s;tice not only in his <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> but in mo&s;t of his be&s;t Tragedies, in which the Guilty and the Innocent peri&s;h promi&s;cuou&s;ly; as <HI>Duncan</HI> and <HI>Banquo</HI> in <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> as likewi&s;e Lady <HI>Macduffe</HI> and her Children; <HI>De&s;demona</HI> in <HI>Othello; Cordelia, Kent,</HI> and King <HI>Lear,</HI> in the Tragedy that bears his Name; <HI>Bru|tus</HI> and <HI>Porcia</HI> in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and young <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI> For tho' it may &s;aid in Defence of the la&s;t, that <HI>Hamlet</HI> had a De&s;ign to kill his Uncle who then reign'd; yet this is ju&s;tify'd by no le&s;s than a Call from Heaven, and rai&s;ing up one from the Dead to urge him to it. The Good and the Bad then peri&s;hing pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly in the be&s;t of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Tra|gedies, there can be either none or very weak In&s;truction in them: For &s;uch promi&s;cuous Events call the Government of Providence into Que&s;tion, and by Scepticks and Liber|tines are re&s;olv'd into Chance. I humbly conceive therefore that this want of Dra|matical Ju&s;tice in the Tragedy of <HI>Coriola|nus,</HI> gave occa&s;ion for a ju&s;t Alteration, and that I was oblig'd to &s;acrifice to that Ju&s;tice

<HI>Aufidius</HI> and the Tribunes, as well as <HI>Co|riolanus.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have we endeavour'd to &s;hew, that for want of the Poetical Art, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay under very great Di&s;advantages. At the &s;ame time we mu&s;t own to his Honour, that he has often perform'd Wonders without it, in &s;pight of the Judgment of &s;o great a Man as <HI>Horace.</HI><Q> 
<L>Natur&acirc; fieret laudabile carmen, an arte,</L>
<L>Quae&s;itum e&s;t: ego nec &s;tudium &s;in&egrave; divite ven&acirc;,</L>
<L>Nec rude quid pro&s;it video ingenium; alte|rius &s;ic</L>
<L>Altera po&s;cit opem res, &amp; conjurat amic&eacute;.</L></Q> But from this very udgment of <HI>Horace</HI> we may ju&s;tly conclude, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> would have wonderfully &s;urpa&s;s'd him&s;elf if Art had been join'd to Nature. There never was a greater Genius in the World than <HI>Virgil:</HI> He was one who &s;eems to have been born for this glorious End, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Mu&s;e might exert in him the ut|mo&s;t Force of her Poetry: And his admi|rable and divine Beauties are manife&s;tly owing to the happy Confederacy of Art and Nature. It was Art that contriv'd that incomparable De&s;ign of the <HI>Ae|neis,</HI> and it was Nature that executed it. Could the greate&s;t Genius that ever was infus'd into Earthly Mold by Heaven if it had been unguided and una&s;&s;i&s;ted by Art
<PB N="381" REF="157">
have taught him to make that noble and wonderful U&s;e of the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Tran&s;mi|gration, which he makes in the Sixth Book of his Poem? Had <HI>Virgil</HI> been a circular Poet, and clo&s;ely adher'd to Hi&s;tory, how could the <HI>Romans</HI> have been tran&s;ported with that inimitable Epi&s;ode of <HI>Dido,</HI> which brought a-fre&s;h into their Minds the <HI>Car|thaginian</HI> War, and the dreadful <HI>Hannibal?</HI> When 'tis evident that that admirable Epi|&s;ode is &s;o little owing to a faithful ob&s;er|vance of Hi&s;tory, and the exact order of Time, that 'tis deriv'd from a very bold but judicious Violation of the&s;e; it being un|deniable that <HI>Dido</HI> liv'd almo&s;t 300 Years after <HI>Aeneas.</HI> Yet is it that charming Epi|&s;ode that makes the chief Beauties of a third Part of the Poem.

<OPENER> 
<DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 6.
1710/11.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>UPON the Encouragement I have re|ceiv'd from you, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew under what Di&s;advantages <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay for want of being conver&s;ant with the Ancients. But becau&s;e I have lately been in &s;ome Conver&s;ation, where they would not allow, but that he was acquainted with the Ancients, I &s;hall endeavour to make it appear that he was not; and the &s;hewing that in the Method in which I pretend to convince the Reader of it, will &s;ufficiently prove, what Inconveniencies he lay under, and what Errors he committed for want of being conver&s;ant with them. But here we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;everal kinds of Acquaintance: A Man may be &s;aid to be acquainted with another who ne|ver was but twice in his Company; but that is at the be&s;t a &s;uperficial Acquaintance,
<PB N="383" REF="159">
from which neither very great Plea&s;ure nor Profit can be deriv'd. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s is here to &s;hew, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had no familiar Acquaintance with the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Authors. For if he was familiarly conver|&s;ant with them, how comes it to pa&s;s that he wants Art? Is it that he &s;tudied to know them in other things; and neglected that only in them, which chiefly tends to the Advancement of the Art of the Stage? Or is it that he wanted Di&s;cernment to &s;ee the Ju&s;tne&s;s, and the Greatne&s;s, and the Har|mony of their De&s;igns, and the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Rules upon which tho&s;e De|&s;igns are founded? Or how come his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors to have that Di&s;cernment which he wanted, when they fall &s;o much below him in other things? How comes he to have been guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Faults in Chronology, and how come we to find out tho&s;e Faults? In his Tragedy of <HI>Troylus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> he in|troduces <HI>Hector</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who was born a thou&s;and Years after the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> In the &s;ame Play mention is made of <HI>Milo,</HI> which is another very great Fault in Chronology. <HI>Alexander</HI> is men|tion'd in <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> tho' that Conqueror of the Orient liv'd above two hundred Years after him. In this la&s;t Tragedy he has mi|taken the very Names of his Dramatick Per&s;ons, if we give Credit to <HI>Livy.</HI> For the Mother of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi|&s;torian
<PB N="384" REF="160">
is <HI>Vetturia,</HI> and the Wife is <HI>Volum|nia.</HI> Whereas in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> the Wife is <HI>Virgilia,</HI> and the Mother <HI>Volumnia.</HI> And the <HI>Vol&s;cian</HI> General in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is <HI>Tul|lus Aufidius,</HI> and <HI>Tullus Attius</HI> in <HI>Livy.</HI> How comes it that he takes <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Word, who was by Birth a <HI>Graecian,</HI> for the Affairs of <HI>Rome,</HI> rather than that of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torian, if &s;o be that he had read the latter? Or what Rea&s;on can be given for his not reading him, when he wrote up|on a <HI>Roman</HI> Story, but that in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s time there was a Tran&s;lation of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> and there was none of <HI>Livy?</HI> If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was familiarly conver&s;ant with the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, how came he to introduce a Rab|ble into <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> in which he offended not only again&s;t the Dignity of Tragedy, but the Truth of Fact, the Authority of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, the Cu&s;toms of An|cient <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Roman</HI> People? By introducing a Rabble into <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> he only offended again&s;t the Dignity of Tragedy. For that part of the People who ran about the Streets upon great Fe&s;tivals, or publick Calamities, or pub|lick Rejoicings, or Revolutions in Govern+ment, are certainly the Scum of the Popu|lace. But the Per&s;ons who in the Time of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> ro&s;e in Vindication of their ju&s;t Rights, and extorted from the Patrician<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the In&s;titution of the Tribunes of the Peo+ple
<PB N="385" REF="161">
and the Per&s;ons by whom afterwards <HI>Coriolanus</HI> was tried, were the whole Body of the <HI>Roman</HI> People to the Re&s;erve of the Patricians, which Body included the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Knights, and the wealthy &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens, who were as different from the Rabble as the Patricians them&s;elves, as qua|lify'd as the latter to form a right Judgment of Things, and to contemn the vain Opi|nions of the Rabble. So at lea&s;t <HI>Horace</HI> e&s;teems them, who very well knew his Countrymen.<Q> 
<L>Offenduntur enim, quibus e&s;t equus, aut pater, aut res,</L>
<L>Nec &s;iquid fricti ciceris probat aut nucis emptor,</L>
<L>Aequis accipiant animis donantve Corona?</L></Q> Where we &s;ee the Knights and the &s;ub&s;tan|tial Citizens are rank'd in an equal Degree of Capacity with the <HI>Roman</HI> Senators, and are equally di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Rabble.</P>
<P>If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was &s;o conver&s;ant with the Ancients, how comes he to have introduc'd &s;ome Characters into his Plays, &s;o unlike what they are to be found in Hi&s;tory? In the Character of <HI>Menenius</HI> in the following Tragedy, he has doubly offended again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Hi&s;torical Re&s;emblance. For fir&s;t where|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>Menenius</HI> was an eloquent Per&s;on, <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> has made him a downright Buffoon.
<PB N="386" REF="162">
And how is it po&s;&s;ible for any Man to con|ceive a <HI>Ciceronian Jack-pudding?</HI> Never was any Buffoon eloquent, or wi&s;e, or witty, or virtuous. All the good and ill Qualities of a Buffoon are &s;umm'd up in one Word, and that is a Buffoon. And &s;econdly, whereas <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has made him a Hater and Contemner and Villifier of the Peo|ple, we are a&s;&s;ur'd by the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tori|an that <HI>Menenius</HI> was extremely popular. He was &s;o very far from oppo&s;ing the In|&s;titution of the Tribunes, as he is repre|&s;ented in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that he was chiefly in&s;trumental in it. After the People had de&s;erted the City, and &s;at down upon the &s;acred Mountain, he was the chief of the Delegates whom the Senate deputed to them, as being look'd upon to be the Per|&s;on who would be mo&s;t agreeable to them. In &s;hort, this very <HI>Menenius</HI> both liv'd and dy'd &s;o very much their Favourite, that dy|ing poor he had pompous Funerals at the Expence of the <HI>Roman</HI> People.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> read either <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> or <HI>Ci|cero,</HI> how could he have made &s;o very lit|tle of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of Men, as that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;hould be but a Fourth-rate Actor in his own Tragedy? How could it have been that &s;eeing <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> we &s;hould ask for <HI>Cae&s;ar?</HI> That we &s;hould ask, where is his unequall'd Greatne&s;s of Mind, his unbounded Thir&s;t of Glory, and that victorious Eloquence,
<PB N="387" REF="163">
with which he triumph'd over the Souls of both Friends and Enemies, and with which he rivall'd <HI>Cicero</HI> in Genius as he did <HI>Pompey</HI> in Power? How fair an Occa|&s;ion was there to open the Character of <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> in the fir&s;t Scene between <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius?</HI> For when <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> tells <HI>Brutus</HI> that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was but a Man like them, and had the &s;ame natural Imperfections which they had, how natural had it been for <HI>Brutus</HI> to reply, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> indeed had their Imper|fections of Nature, but neither he nor <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ius</HI> had by any means the great Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar:</HI> neither his Military Virtue, nor Science, nor his matchle&s;s Renown, nor his unparallell'd Victories, his unwearied Boun|ty to his Friends, nor his Godlike Clemen|cy to his Foes, his Beneficence, his Muni|ficence, his Ea&s;ine&s;s of Acce&s;s to the mea|ne&s;t <HI>Roman,</HI> his indefatigable Labours, his incredible Celerity, the Plau&s;iblene&s;s if not Ju&s;tne&s;s of his Ambition, that knowing him|&s;elf to be the greate&s;t of Men, he only &s;ought occa&s;ion to make the World confe&s;s him &s;uch. In &s;hort, if <HI>Brutus,</HI> after enu|merating all the wonderful Qualities of <HI>Cae|&s;ar,</HI> had re&s;olv'd in &s;pight of them all to &s;acrifice him to publick Liberty, how had &s;uch a Proceeding heighten'd the Virtue and the Character of <HI>Brutus?</HI> But then in|deed it would have been requi&s;ite that <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="164">
upon his Appearance &s;hould have made all this good. And as we know no Princi|ple of human Action but human Sentiment only, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> who did greater Things, and had greater De&s;igns than the re&s;t of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> ought certainly to have out&s;hin'd by many Degrees all the other Characters of his Tragedy. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> ought particularly to have ju&s;tified his Actions, and to have heigh|ten'd his Character, by &s;hewing that what he had done, he had done by Nece&s;&s;ity; that the <HI>Romans</HI> had lo&s;t their <HI>Agrarian,</HI> lo&s;t their Rotation of Magi&s;tracy, and that con&s;equently nothing but an empty Shadow of publick Liberty remain'd. That the <HI>Gracchi</HI> had made the la&s;t noble but un&s;uc|ce&s;sful Efforts, for the re&s;toring the Com|monwealth, that they had fail'd for want of arbitrary irre&s;i&s;tible Power, the Re&s;torati|on of the <HI>Agrarian</HI> requiring too va&s;t a Re|tro&s;pect to be done without it; that the Go|vernment, when <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> came to publick Af+fairs, was got into the Hands of a few, and that tho&s;e few were factious, and were con|tending among them&s;elves, and if you will pardon &s;o mean an Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;crambling as it were for Power: That <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was re|duc'd to the Nece&s;&s;ity of ruling, or him&s;elf obeying a Ma&s;ter; and that apprehending that another would exerci&s;e the &s;upreme Command, without that Clemency and Mo+deration which he did, he had rather cho+&s;en
<PB N="389" REF="165">
to rule than to obey. So that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was faulty not &s;o much in &s;eizing upon the Sovereignty, which was become in a man|ner nece&s;&s;ary, as in not re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the Commonwealth, by re&s;toring the <HI>Agrarian</HI> and the Rotation of Magi&s;tracies, after he had got ab&s;olute and uncontroulable Power. And if <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had &s;eiz'd upon the Sove|reignty only with a View of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing Liberty, he had &s;urpa&s;s'd all Mortals in Godlike Goodne&s;s as much as he did in the re&s;t of his a&s;toni&s;hing Qualities. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not remember that we have any Authority from the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians which may induce us to believe, that <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> had any &s;uch De&s;ign. Nor if he had had any &s;uch View, could he, who was the mo&s;t &s;ecret, the mo&s;t prudent, and the mo&s;t di&s;cerning of Men, have di&s;cover'd it, before his <HI>Parthian</HI> Expedition was over, for fear of utterly di&s;obliging his Veterans. And <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> believ'd that Expedition nece&s;&s;a|ry for the Honour and Intere&s;t of the State, and for his own Glory.</P>
<P>But of this we may be &s;ure, that two of the mo&s;t di&s;cerning of all the <HI>Romans,</HI> and who had the deepe&s;t In&s;ight into the Soul of <HI>Cae&s;ar, Sallu&s;t</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> were not with|out Hopes that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would really re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h Liberty, or el&s;e they would not have attack'd him upon it; the one in his Ora|tion
<PB N="390" REF="166">
for <HI>Marcus Marcellus,</HI> the other in the Second Part of that little Treati&s;e <HI>De Re|public&acirc; ordinand&acirc;,</HI> which is addre&s;s'd to <HI>Cae|&s;ar. Haec igitur tibi reliqua pars,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Ci|cero, Hic re&s;tat Actus, in hoc elaborandum e&s;t, ut Rempublicam con&s;tituas, e&acirc;que tu in primis compo&s;it&acirc;, &s;umma Tranquillitate &amp; otio perfruare. Cicero</HI> therefore was not without Hope that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Commonwealth; and any one who at|tentively peru&s;es that Oration of <HI>Cicero,</HI> will find that that Hope was rea&s;onably grounded, upon his knowledge of the great Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> his Clemency, his Be|neficence, his admirable Di&s;cernment; and that avoidle&s;s Ruine in which the whole Empire would be &s;oon involv'd, if <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> did not effect this. <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> urges it &s;till more home to him and with greater vehe|mence; he has recour&s;e to every Motive that may be thought to be powerful over &s;o great a Soul. He exhorts him by the Memory of his matchle&s;s Conque&s;ts, not to &s;uffer the invincible Empire of the <HI>Roman</HI> People to be devour'd by Time, or to be torn in pieces by Di&s;cord; one of which would &s;oon and infallibly happen, if Liber|ty was not re&s;tor'd.</P>
<P>He introduces his Country and his Pro|genitors urging him in a noble Pro&s;opopeia, by all the mighty Benefits which they had conferr'd upon him, with &s;o little Pains of
<PB N="391" REF="167">
his own, not to deny them that ju&s;t and ea|&s;y Reque&s;t of the Re&s;toration of Liberty. He adjures him by tho&s;e Furies which will eternally haunt his Soul upon his impious Refu&s;al: He implores him by the fore&s;ight of tho&s;e di&s;mal Calamities, that horrible Slaughter, tho&s;e endle&s;s Wars, and that un|bounded Deva&s;tation, which will certainly fall upon Mankind, if the Re&s;toration of Liberty is prevented by his Death, or his incurable Sickne&s;s: And la&s;tly, he entreats him by his Thir&s;t of immortal Glory, that Glory in which he now has Rivals, if he has not Equals; but which, if he re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hes Liberty, will be acknowledg'd by con&s;enting Nations to have neither Equal nor Second.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe that if <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had been acquainted with all this, we had had from him quite another Character of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> than that which we now find in him. He might then have given us a Scene &s;omething like that which <HI>Corneille</HI> has &s;o happily us'd in his <HI>Cinna;</HI> &s;omething like that which really happen'd between <HI>Augu&s;tus, Mecaenas</HI> and <HI>Agrippa.</HI> He might then have intro|duc'd <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> con&s;ulting <HI>Cicero</HI> on the one &s;ide, and on the other <HI>Anthony,</HI> whether he &s;hould retain that ab&s;olute Sovereignty, which he had acquir'd by his Victory, or whether he &s;hould re-e&s;tabli&s;h and immorta|ize Liberty. That would have been a
<PB N="392" REF="168">
Scene, which might have employ'd the fi|ne&s;t Art and the utmo&s;t force of a Writer. That had been a Scene in which all the great Qualities of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> might have been di&s;play'd. I will not pretend to determine here how that Scene might have been turn'd; and what I have already &s;aid on this Sub|ject, has been &s;poke with the utmo&s;t Cau|tion and Diffidence. But this I will ven|ture to &s;ay, that if that Scene had been ma|nag'd &s;o, as, by the powerful Motives em|ploy'd in it, to have &s;haken the Soul of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and to have left room for the lea&s;t Hope, for the lea&s;t Doubt, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would have re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd Liberty, after his <HI>Par|thian</HI> Expedition; and if this Conver&s;ation had been kept &s;ecret till the Death of <HI>Cae|&s;ar,</HI> and then had been di&s;cover'd by <HI>An|thony,</HI> then had <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> fall'n, &s;o belov'd and lamented by the <HI>Roman</HI> People, &s;o pitied and &s;o bewail'd even by the Con&s;pirator<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves, as never Man fell.

For there is, &s;ay they, among <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Plays, one call'd <HI>The Comedy of Errors,</HI> which is undeniably an Imitation of the <HI>Me|nechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus.</HI> Now <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> &s;ay they, being conver&s;ant with <HI>Plautus,</HI> it undeniably follows that he was acquainted with the Ancients; becau&s;e no <HI>Roman</HI> Au|thor could be hard to him who had con|quer'd <HI>Plautus.</HI> To which I an&s;wer, that the Errors which we have mention'd above are to be accounted for no other way, but by the want of knowing the Ancients, or by downright want of Capacity. But no|thing can be more ab&s;urd or more unju&s;t than to impute it to want of Capacity. For the very Sentiments of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> a|lone
<PB N="395" REF="171">
are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that he had a great Under&s;tanding: And therefore we mu&s;t account &s;ome other way for his Imi|tation of the <HI>Menechmi.</HI> I remember to have &s;een among the Tran&s;lations of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Epi&s;tles printed by Mr. <HI>Ton&s;on,</HI> an Imitati|on of that from <HI>OEnone</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> tells us in his Preface to tho&s;e Epi&s;tles was imitated by one of the Fair Sex who under&s;tood no <HI>Latin,</HI> but that &s;he had done enough to make tho&s;e blu&s;h who under&s;tood it the be&s;t. There are at this day &s;everal Tran&s;lators, who, as <HI>Hudi|bra&s;s</HI> has it,<Q> 
<L>Tran&s;late from Languages of which</L>
<L>They under&s;tand no part of Speech.</L></Q> I will not affirm that of <HI>Shake&s;pear;</HI> I be|lieve he was able to do what Pedants call con&s;true, but that he was able to read <HI>Plau|tus</HI> without Pain and Difficulty I can never believe. Now I appeal to you, Sir, what time he had between his Writing and his Acting, to read any thing that could not be read with Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure. We &s;ee that our Adver&s;aries them&s;elves acknow|ledge, that if <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was able to read <HI>Plautus</HI> with Ea&s;e, nothing in Latinity could be hard to him. How comes it to pa&s;s then, that he has given us no Proofs of his familiar Acquaintance with the Anci|ents,
<PB N="396" REF="172">
but this Imitation of the <HI>Menechmi,</HI> and a Ver&s;ion of two Epi&s;tles of <HI>Ovid?</HI> How comes it that he had never read <HI>Ho|race</HI> of a &s;uperiour Merit to either, and particularly his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Pi&s;o's,</HI> which &s;o much concern'd his Art? Or if he had read that Epi&s;tle, how comes it that in his <HI>Troylus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> [we mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the way, that when <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> wrote that Play, <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> had not as yet tran&s;la|ted that Epi&s;tle] he runs counter to the In&s;tructions which <HI>Horace</HI> has given for the forming the Character of <HI>Achilles?</HI><Q> 
<L>Scriptor: Honoratum &s;i forte reponis A|chillem,</L>
<L>Impiger, Iracundus, Inexorablis, Acer,</L>
<L>Jura neget &s;ibi nata.</L></Q> Where is the <HI>Impiger,</HI> the <HI>Iracundus,</HI> or the <HI>Acer,</HI> in the Character of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Achilles?</HI> who is nothing but a drolling, lazy, conceited, overlooking Coxcomb; &s;o far from being the honour'd <HI>Achilles,</HI> the Epithet that <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> after him give him, that he is de&s;ervedly the Scorn and the Je&s;t of the re&s;t of the Characters, even to that Buffoon <HI>Ther&s;ites.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;ucceeded very well in Comedy, yet his principal Talent and his chief Delight was Tragedy. If then <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> was qualify'd to read <HI>Plautus</HI> with
<PB N="397" REF="173">
Ea&s;e, he could read with a great deal more Ea&s;e the Tran&s;lations of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Eu|ripides.</HI> And tho' by the&s;e Tran&s;lations he would not have been able to have &s;een the charming colouring of tho&s;e great Ma|&s;ters, yet would he have &s;een all the Har|mony and the Beauty of their great and their ju&s;t De&s;igns. He would have &s;een enough to have &s;tirr'd up a noble Emulati|on in &s;o exalted a Soul as his. How comes it then that we hear nothing from him, of the <HI>O Edipus,</HI> the <HI>Electra,</HI> the <HI>Antigone</HI> of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> of the <HI>Iphigenia's,</HI> the <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> the <HI>Medea,</HI> the <HI>Hecuba</HI> of <HI>Euripides?</HI> How comes it that we &s;ee nothing in the Conduct of his Pieces, that &s;hews us that he had the lea&s;t Acquaintance with any of the&s;e great Ma&s;ter-pieces? Did <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> appear to be &s;o nearly touch'd with the Affliction of <HI>Hecuba</HI> for the Death of <HI>Pri|am,</HI> which was but daub'd and bungled by one of his Countrymen, that he could not forbear introducing it as it were by Vio|lence into his own <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and would he make no Imitation, no Commendation, not the lea&s;t Mention of the unparallell'd and inimitable Grief of the <HI>Hecuba</HI> of <HI>Euri|pides?</HI> How comes it, that we find no Imi|tation of any ancient Play in Him but the <HI>Menechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus?</HI> How came he to chu&s;e a Comick preferably to the Tragick Poets? Or how comes he to chu&s;e <HI>Plutus</HI>
<PB N="398" REF="174">
preferably to <HI>Terence,</HI> who is &s;o much more ju&s;t, more graceful, more regular, and more natural? Or how comes he to chu&s;e the <HI>Menechmi</HI> of <HI>Plautus,</HI> which is by no means his Ma&s;ter-piece, before all his other Comedies? I vehemently &s;u&s;pect that this Imitation of the <HI>Menechmi,</HI> was either from a printed Tran&s;lation of that Come|dy which is lo&s;t, or &s;ome Ver&s;ion in Ma|nu&s;cript brought him by a Friend, or &s;ent him perhaps by a Stranger, or from the original Play it &s;elf recommended to him, and read to him by &s;ome learned Friend. In &s;hort, I had rather account for this, by what is not ab&s;urd than by what is, or by a le&s;s Ab&s;urdity than by a greater. For nothing can be more wrong than to con|clude from this that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was con|ver&s;ant with the Ancients; which contra|dicts the Te&s;timony of his Contemporary, and his familiar Acquaintance <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> and of his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Milton;</HI><Q> 
<L>Lo <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> Fancy's &s;weete&s;t Child,</L>
<L>Warbles his native Wood-notes wild.</L></Q> and of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> after them both; and which de&s;troys the mo&s;t glorious Part of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Merit immediately. For how can he be e&s;teem'd equal by Nature, or &s;u|perior to the Ancients, when he falls &s;o far &s;hort of them in Art, tho' he had the Ad|vantage
<PB N="399" REF="175">
of knowing all that they did before him? Nay it deba&s;es him below tho&s;e of common Capacity, by rea&s;on of the Errors which we mention'd above. Therefore he who allows that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had Learning and a familiar Acquaintance with the An|cients, ought to be look'd upon as a De|tractor from his extraordinary Merit, and from the Glory of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> For whe|ther is it more honourable for this I&s;land to have produc'd a Man, who without ha|ving any Acquaintance with the Ancients, or any but a &s;lender and a &s;uperficial one, appears to be their Equal or their Superiour by the Force of Genius and Nature, or to have bred one who know|ing the Ancients, falls infinitely &s;hort of them in Art, and con&s;equently in Nature it &s;elf? <HI>Great Britain</HI> has but little Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of its Natives Education, &s;ince the &s;ame that they had here, they might have had in another place. But it may ju&s;tly claim a very great &s;hare in their Nature and Genius; &s;ince the&s;e depend in a great mea&s;ure on the Climate; and therefore <HI>Horace</HI> in the In&s;truction which he gives for the forming the Characters, advi&s;es the noble <HI>Romans</HI> for who&s;e In&s;truction he chiefly writes to con&s;ider whether the Dra|matick Per&s;on whom they introduce is<Q><PB N="400" REF="176"> 
<L>Colchus an A&s;&s;yrius, Thebis nutritus an Argis.</L></Q> Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to &s;hew un|der what great Di&s;advantages <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lay, for want of the Poetical Art, and for want of being conver&s;ant with the Anci|ents.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, he lay under other very great Inconveniencies. For he was neither Ma&s;ter of Time enough to con&s;ider, cor|rect, and poli&s;h what he wrote, to alter it, to add to it, and to retrench from it, nor had he Friends to con&s;ult upon who&s;e Ca|pacity and Integrity he could depend. And tho' a Per&s;on of very good Judgment, may &s;ucceed very well without con&s;ulting his Friends, if he takes time enough to correct what he writes; yet even the greate&s;t Man that Nature and Art can con&s;pire to accom|pli&s;h, can never attain to Perfection, with|out either employing a great deal of time, or taking the Advice of judicious Friends. Nay, 'tis the Opinion of <HI>Horace,</HI> that he ought to do both.<Q> 
<L>Siquid tamen olim</L>
<L>Scrip&s;eris, in Metii de&s;cendat Judicis aures,</L>
<L>Et Patris, &amp; no&s;tras; nonumque prematur in Annum.</L></Q> Now we know very well that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>
<PB N="401" REF="177">
was an Actor, at a time when there were &s;even or eight Companies of Players in the Town together, who each of them did their utmo&s;t Endeavours to get the Audi|ences from the re&s;t, and con&s;equently that our Author was perpetually call'd upon, by tho&s;e who had the Direction and Manage|ment of the Company to which he belong'd, for new Pieces which might be able to &s;up|port them, and give them &s;ome Advantage over the re&s;t. And 'tis ea&s;ie to judge what Time he was Ma&s;ter of, between his labo|rious Employment of Acting, and his con|tinual Hurry of Writing. As for Friends, they whom in all likelihood <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> con|&s;ulted mo&s;t, were two or three of his Fel|low-Actors, becau&s;e they had the Care of publi&s;hing his Works committed to them. Now they, as we are told by <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> in his <HI>Di&s;coveries,</HI> were extremely pleas'd with their Friend for &s;carce ever making a Blot; and were very angry with <HI>Ben,</HI> for &s;aying he wi&s;h'd that he had made a thou|&s;and. The Misfortune of it is, that <HI>Horace</HI> was perfectly of <HI>Ben</HI>'s mind.<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Vos O,</L>

<L>Could it be known what they di&s;creetly blot.</L></Q> The&s;e Friends then of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> were not qualify'd to advi&s;e him. As for <HI>Ben John|&s;on,</HI> be&s;ides that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> began to know him late, and that <HI>Ben</HI> was not the mo&s;t communicative Per&s;on in the World of the Secrets of his Art; he &s;eems to me to have had no right Notion of Tragedy. Nay, &s;o far from it, that he who was indeed a very great Man, and who has writ Comedies, by which he has born away the Prize of Co|medy both from Ancients and Moderns, and been an Honour to <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and who has done this without any Rules to guide him, except what his own incomparable Talent dictated to him; This extraordina|ry Man has err'd &s;o gro&s;sly in Tragedy, of which there were not only &s;tated Rules, but Rules which he him&s;elf had often read, and had even tran&s;lated, that he has cho|&s;en two Subjects, which, according to tho&s;e very Rules, were utterly incapable of ex|citing either Compa&s;&s;ion or Terror for the principal Characters, which yet are the chief Pa&s;&s;ions that a Tragick Poet ought to endeavour to excite. So that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> having neither had Time to correct, nor
<PB N="403" REF="179">
Friends to con&s;ult, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have frequently left &s;uch faults in his Writings, for the Correction of which either a great deal of Time or a judicious and a well-na|tur'd Friend is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.<Q> 
<L>Vir bonus &amp; prudens ver&s;us reprehendet inertes,</L>
<L>Culpabit duros, incomptis allinet Atrum</L>

<L>Ornamenta, parum claris lucem dare coget,</L>
<L>Arguet ambigue dictum, metanda notabit.</L></Q> There is more than one Example of every kind of the&s;e Faults in the Tragedies of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and even in the <HI>Coriolanus.</HI> There are Lines that are utterly void of that cele&s;tial Fire, of which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is &s;ometimes Ma&s;ter in &s;o great a Degree. And con&s;equently there are Lines that are &s;tiff and forc'd, and har&s;h and unmu&s;ical, tho' <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had naturally an admirable Ear for the Numbers. But no Man ever was very mu&s;ical who did not write with Fire, and no Man can always write with Fire, unle&s;s he is &s;o far Ma&s;ter of his Time, as to expect tho&s;e Hours when his Spirits are warm and volatile. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> mu&s;t therefore &s;ometimes have Lines which are neither &s;trong nor graceful: For who ever had Force or Grace that had not Spi|rit? There are in his <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> among a
<PB N="404" REF="180">
great many natural and admirable Beauties, three or four of tho&s;e Ornaments which <HI>Horace</HI> would term ambitious; and which we in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are apt to call Fu&s;tian or Bomba&s;t. There are Lines in &s;ome Places which are very ob&s;cure, and whole Scenes which ought to be alter'd.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, employ'd &s;ome Time and Pains, and that little Judgment which I have acquir'd in the&s;e Matters by a long and a faithful reading both of Ancients and Mo|derns, in adding, retrenching and altering &s;everal Things in the <HI>Coriolanus</HI> of <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> but with what Succe&s;s I mu&s;t leave to be determin'd by you. I know very well that you will be &s;urpriz'd to find, that after all that I have &s;aid in the former Part of this Letter, again&s;t <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s intro|ducing the Rabble into <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> I have not only retain'd in the &s;econd Act of the following Tragedy the Rabble which is in the Original, but deviated more from the <HI>Roman</HI> Cu&s;toms than <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had done before me. I de&s;ire you to look upon it as a voluntary Fault and a Tre&s;pa&s;s a|gain&s;t Conviction: 'Tis one of tho&s;e Things which are <HI>ad Populum Phalerae,</HI> and by no means in&s;erted to plea&s;e &s;uch Men as you.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I laid before you a &s;hort but impartial Account of the Beauties and Defects of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> with an Intention to make the&s;e Letters publick if they are ap|prov'd
<PB N="405" REF="181">
by you; to teach &s;ome People to di&s;tingui&s;h between his Beauties and his Defects, that while they imitate the one, they may with Caution avoid the other [there being nothing of more dangerous Contagion to Writers, and e&s;pecially to young ones, than the Faults of great Ma|&s;ters] and while with <HI>Milton</HI> they applaud the great Qualities which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> had by Nature, they may follow his wife Ex|ample, and form them&s;elves as he a&s;&s;ures us that he him&s;elf did, upon the Rules and Writings of the Ancients.</P>
<P>Sir, if &s;o candid and able a Judge as your &s;elf &s;hall happen to approve of this E&s;&s;ay in the main, and to excu&s;e and correct my Er|rors, that Indulgence and that Correction will not only encourage me to make the&s;e Letters publick, but will enable me to bear the Reproach of tho&s;e, who would fix a Brand, even upon the ju&s;te&s;t Critici&s;m, as the Effect of Envy and Ill-nature; as if there could po&s;&s;ibly be any Ill-nature in the doing Ju&s;tice, or in the endeavouring to ad|vance a very noble and a very u&s;eful Art, and con&s;equently to prove beneficent to Mankind. As for tho&s;e who may accu&s;e me of the want of a due Veneration for the Merit of an Author of &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Re|putation as <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> I &s;hall beg leave to tell them, that they chu&s;e the wronge&s;t time that they could po&s;&s;ibly take for &s;uch

<HEAD>To the SPECTATOR, upon his Paper on the 16th of
April.</HEAD>
<P>YOU know, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that E&s;quire <HI>Bicker&s;t aff</HI> attack'd the Sharpers with Succe&s;s; but <HI>Shadwell</HI> is of Opinion that your Bully with his Box and his fal&s;e Dice is an hone&s;ter Fellow than the Rhetorical Author, who makes u&s;e of his Tropes and Figures, which are his High and his Low|runners, to cheat us at once of our Money and of our Intellectuals.</P>
<P>I would not have you think, Mr. <HI>Specta|tor,</HI> that this Reflection is directed to you: 'Tis only intended again&s;t one or two of your Corre&s;pondents, and particularly the <HI>Inns-of Court</HI>-man, who, as you told us in your Se|cond Paper, &s;upplies you with mo&s;t of your Critici&s;m: who &s;eems to me &s;o little to un|der&s;tand the Province that he has underta|ken, that you would do well to advi&s;e him to do by you as he has done by his Father, and make a Bargain in the gro&s;s with &s;ome hone&s;t Fellow to an&s;wer all your Occa&s;ions. Which whole&s;ome Advice if he proves too ob&s;tinate or too proud to take; I am confi|dent
<PB N="408" REF="184">
at lea&s;t that he is too gallant a Per&s;on to take it ill if once a Week or once a Fort|night I &s;hould &s;hew &s;o much Pre&s;umption as to cau&s;e a Writ of Error to be i&s;&s;ued out to rever&s;e his <HI>Temple</HI>-Judgment.</P>
<P>I cannot wonder that Critici&s;m &s;hould de|generate &s;o vilely at a time when Poetry and Acting are &s;unk &s;o low. For as <HI>Hobbes</HI> has ob&s;erv'd, that as often as Rea&s;on is again&s;t a Man, a Man will be again&s;t Rea&s;on; &s;o as often as the Rules are again&s;t an Author, an Author will be again&s;t the Rules. Men fir&s;t write fooli&s;h ridiculous Tragedies, which &s;hock all the Rules of Rea&s;on and Philo&s;o|phy, and then they make fooli&s;h extravagant Rules to fit tho&s;e fooli&s;h Plays. 'Tis impo&s;|&s;ible that your Gentleman of the Inns-of-Court could have &s;ent you &s;o much wrong Sen&s;e as there is in your Paper of the 16<HI>th,</HI> if he had not formerly writ an ab&s;urd Tra|gedy. There are as many Bulls and Blun|derrs, and Contradictions in it almo&s;t as there are Lines, and all deliver'd with that in&s;o|lent and that blu&s;t'ring Air, which u&s;ually attends upon Error, and Delu&s;ion, while Truth, like the Deity that in&s;pires it, comes calmly and without noi&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;et a few of his Errors in their pro|per Light, he tells us in the beginning of that Paper, <HI>That the Engli&s;h Writers of Tragedy are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Notion, that when they repre&s;ent a virtuous or innocent</HI><PB N="409" REF="185">
<HI>Per&s;on in Di&s;tre&s;s, they ought not to leave him till they have deliver'd him out of his Trouble, and made him triumph over his Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>But, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> is this peculiar to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers of Tragedy? <HI>Have not the</HI> French <HI>Writers of Tragedy the &s;ame Notion? Does not</HI> Racine <HI>tell us, in the Preface to his</HI> Iphigenia, <HI>that it would have been hor|rible to have defil'd the Stage with the Mur|ther of a Prince&s;s &s;o virtuous and &s;o lovely as was</HI> Iphigenia.</P>
<P>But your Corre&s;pondent goes on, <HI>This Error,</HI> &s;ays he, with an in&s;olent and dog|matick Air, <HI>they have been led into by a ri|diculous Doctrine in modern Critici&s;m, that they are oblig'd to an equal Di&s;tribution of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, and an impar|tial Execution of poetical Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>But who were the fir&s;t who e&s;tabli&s;h'd this Rule he is not able to tell. I take it for granted, that a Man who is ingenuous e|nough to own his Ignorance, is willing to be in&s;tructed. Let me tell him then, that the fir&s;t who e&s;tabli&s;h'd this ridiculous Do|ctrine of modern Critici&s;m, was a certain modern Critick, who liv'd above two thou&s;and Years ago; and who tells us ex|pre&s;ly in the thirteenth Chapter of his criti|cal <HI>Spectator,</HI> which Pedants call his Poetick, <HI>That &s;ince a Tragedy, to have all the Beauty of which it is capable, ought to be Implex and not Simple,</HI> (by the way, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> you
<PB N="410" REF="186">
mu&s;t bear with this critical Cant, as we do with your Speculations and Lucubrations) <HI>and ought to move Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror, for we have already &s;hewn that the exciting the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions is the proper Effect of a tra|gical Imitation, it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that we mu&s;t not choo&s;e a very good Man, to plunge him from a pro&s;perous Condition into Adver|&s;ity, for in&s;tead of moving Compa&s;&s;ion and Terrour, that on the contrary would create Horrour, and be dete&s;ted by all the World.</HI></P>
<P>And does not the &s;ame deluded Philo&s;o|pher tell us in the very &s;ame Chapter, that the Fable to which he gives the &s;econd Pre|ference, is that which has a double Con&s;titu|tion, and which ends by a double Cata&s;tro|phe; a Cata&s;trophe favourable to the Good and fatal to the Wicked. Is not here, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> a very formal Recommendation of the impartial and exact Execution of poe|tical Ju&s;tice? Thus <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was the fir&s;t who e&s;tabli&s;h'd this ridiculous Doctrine of modern Critici&s;m, but Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> was the fir&s;t who introduc'd it into our native Lan|guage; who notwith&s;tanding the Rage of all the Poeta&s;ters of the Times, whom he has exa&s;perated by opening the Eyes of the Blind that they may &s;ee their Errors, will always pa&s;s with impartial Po&s;terity for a mo&s;t lear|ned, a mo&s;t judicious, and a mo&s;t u&s;eful Cri|tick. Now is not your Corre&s;pondent a profound and a learned Per&s;on? and ought

<P>But he goes on in his dictatorian way: <HI>This Rule,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>whoever e&s;tabli&s;h'd it, has, I am &s;ure, no Foundation in Nature, in Rea|&s;on, and in the practice of the Ancients.</HI> But what will this dogmatick Per&s;on &s;ay now, when we &s;hew him that this contemptible Doctrine of poetical Ju&s;tice is not only foun|ded in Rea&s;on and Nature, but is it &s;elf the Foundation of all the Rules, and ev'n of Tra|gedy it&s;elf? For what Tragedy can there be without a Fable? or what Fable without a Moral? or what Moral without poetical Ju|&s;tice? What Moral, where the Good and the Bad are confounded by De&s;tiny, and peri&s;h alike promi&s;cuou&s;ly.

that the Pactice of the Ancients, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> their Ma&s;ter-pieces, is exactly according to this fundamental Rule.

<P><HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;ays your Corre&s;pon|dent, <HI>has no Foundation in Nature and Rea&s;on, becau&s;e we find that good and evil happen alike to all Men on this &s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Grave.</HI> In an&s;wer to which he mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> give me leave to tell him, that this is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> only a very fal&s;e but a dangerous A&s;&s;ertion, that we neither know what Men really are nor what they really &s;uffer.</P>
<P>'Tis not always that we know Men'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Crimes, but how &s;eldom do we know their Pa&s;&s;ions, and e&s;pecially their dar+ling Pa&s;&s;ions? And as Pa&s;&s;ion is the Occa&s;ion of infinitely more Di&s;order in the World than Malice, [for where one Man falls a Sacrifice to inveterate Malice thou&s;and become Victims to Revenge and Ambition; and whereas Malice has &s;ome+thing that &s;hocks human Nature, Pa&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ingly catching and contagious.] Can any+thing be more ju&s;t, than that that Providenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which governs the World &s;hould puni&s;h Men
<PB N="413" REF="189">
for indulging their Pa&s;&s;ions, as much as for obeying the Dictates of their mo&s;t enven|om'd Hatred and Malice?</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, for ought we know, Good and Evil does not happen alike to all Men on this &s;ide the Grave. Becau&s;e 'tis for the mo&s;t part, by their Pa&s;&s;ions, that Men of|fend; and 'tis by their Pa&s;&s;ions, for the mo&s;t part, that they are puni&s;h'd. But this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> certain, that the more Virtue a Man has the more he commands his Pa&s;&s;ions; but the Virtuous alone command them. The Wick|ed take the utmo&s;t Care to di&s;&s;emble and conceal them; for which rea&s;on we neither know what our Neighbours are, nor what they really &s;uffer. Man is too finite, too &s;hallow, and too empty a Creature to know another Man throughly, to know the Crea|ture of an infinite Creator; but dramatical Per&s;ons are Creatures of which a Poet is him&s;elf the Creator. And tho' a Mortal is not able to know the Almighty's Creatures, he may be allow'd to know his own; to know the utmo&s;t Extent of their Guilt, and what they ought to &s;uffer; nay, he mu&s;t be allow'd not only to know this him&s;elf, but to make it manife&s;t and unque&s;tionable to all his Readers and Hearers. The Crea|tures of a poetical Creator have no Di&s;&s;imu|lation and no Re&s;erve. We &s;ee their Pa&s;|&s;ions in all their Height, and in all their De|formity;
<PB N="414" REF="190">
and when they are unfortunate, we are never to &s;eek for the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould grant that there is not always an equal Di&s;tribution of Affli|on and Happine&s;s here below. Man is a Creature who was created immortal, and a Creature con&s;equently that will find a Compen&s;ation in Futurity for any &s;eeming Inequality in his De&s;tiny here. But the Creatures of a poetical Creator are imagi|nary and tran&s;itory; they have no longer Duration than the Repre&s;entation of their re&s;pective Fables; and con&s;equently, if they offend, they mu&s;t be puni&s;h'd during that Repre&s;entation. And therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical Ju|&s;tice is an equal Repre&s;entation of the Ju|&s;tice of the Almighty.</P>
<P>We freely confe&s;s that 'tis but a very narrow and a very imperfect Type of it; &s;o very narrow, and &s;o very imperfect, that 'tis forc'd by temporal to repre&s;ent eternal Puni&s;hments; and therefore when we &s;hew a Man unfortunate in Tragedy, for not re|&s;training his Pa&s;&s;ions, we mean that every one will for &s;uch Neglect, unle&s;s he timely repents, be infallibly puni&s;h'd by infinite Ju&s;tice either here or hereafter.</P>
<P>If upon this Foot we examine the Trage|dies of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides,</HI> we &s;hall find that in their mo&s;t beautiful Pieces, they are impartial Executors of Poetick Ju&s;tice. And
<PB N="415" REF="191">
'tis upon this Foot that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> requires that we &s;hould examine them. Your Corre&s;pon|dent I mu&s;t confe&s;s is in the right when he &s;ays that that Philo&s;opher declares for Tra|gedies, who&s;e Cata&s;trophes are unhappy with relation to the principal Characters. But then what In&s;tructions does he give us for the forming tho&s;e principal Characters? We are neither to make them very virtuous Per&s;ons on the one &s;ide, that is Per&s;ons who ab&s;olutely command their Pa&s;&s;ions, nor on the other &s;ide Villains who are actuated by inveterate Malice, but &s;omething between the&s;e two, that is to &s;ay Per&s;ons who neg|lecting their Pa&s;&s;ions &s;uffer them to grow outragious, and to hurry them to Actions which they otherwi&s;e would abhor. And that Philo&s;opher expre&s;sly declares, as we have &s;hewn above, that to make a virtuous Man unhappy, that is a Man who ab&s;olute|ly commands his Pa&s;&s;ions, would create Horror in&s;tead of Compa&s;&s;ion, and would be dete&s;ted by all the World. And thus we have &s;hewn that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> is for Poetical Ju&s;tice, notwith&s;tanding that he is for un|happy Cata&s;trophes. And &s;o one would think was your Corre&s;pondent. For when he enumerates and commends &s;ome <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Tragedies, which have unfortunate Cata&s;trophes; there are not two of tho&s;e which he commends, who&s;e principal Cha|racters can be &s;aid to be innocent, and con|&s;equently
<PB N="416" REF="192">
there are not two of them where there is not a due Ob&s;ervance of poetical Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the Bu&s;ine&s;s of poetical Ju&s;tice, and &s;hewn it to be the Foundation of all Tragedy; and therefore whatever Per&s;ons, whether anci|ent or modern, have writ Dialogues which they call Tragedies, where this Ju&s;tice is not ob&s;erv'd, tho&s;e Per&s;ons have entertain'd and amus'd the World with romantick lamen|table Tales, in&s;tead of ju&s;t Tragedies, and of lawful Fables.</P>
<P>'Tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to take a|ny farther Notice of the Errors of your Cor|re&s;pondent; perhaps I no more approve of Tragi-Comedies, or Tragedies with double Plots, than he does; But I hope he will not take it ill if I put him in mind that &s;everal of the Plays which he recommended before are Tragi-Comedies, and that mo&s;t of them have double Plots. But he is vilely mi&s;ta|ken if he thinks that Tragi-Comedy is of the Growth of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatres.</P>

<HEAD>To the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the 24th of
April.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read over your Paper of the 24<HI>th</HI> with a great deal of Satisfaction, and here return you my Acknowledgments for the Honour you have done me in quoting two of my Ver&s;es with Applau&s;e. I think my &s;elf oblig'd in Gratitude, my worthy Friend, to do as much Honour to your Judgment as you have done to my Imagination; and as you have the Goodne&s;s to allow me to be an humorous Poet, I am bound in Ju|&s;tice to celebrate you for a wonderful Cri|tick; and to make it appear that, contrary to the Ob&s;ervation of the Author of a late Rhap&s;ody, one who has &s;hewn him&s;elf no great Poet may be a prodigious Judge. In|deed the Ob&s;ervation of that Author is &s;o far from being true, that mo&s;t of the Criticks Ancient and Modern have been no Poets, and mo&s;t of the Poets Ancient and Modern have been no Criticks. I cannot find out that any but <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Sophocles,</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> among the
<PB N="418" REF="194">
Ancients were great Criticks. For who can believe, that has read them, that <HI>Apollonius Rhodius, Nonnus, Lucan, Statius,</HI> and <HI>Si|lius Italicus</HI> ever &s;o much as heard that Nature, and the Philo&s;ophers her Interpre|ters and Commentators, had laid down Rules for an Epick Poem? And who that has read the Moderns could imagine, that mo&s;t of their Dramatick Poets had ever &s;o much as heard that there were &s;uch things as the Rules? As <HI>Boileau</HI> has ob&s;erv'd of the <HI>French,</HI> that &s;ome Per&s;ons among them had di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves by their Rhymes, who never knew how to di&s;tin|gui&s;h <HI>Lucan</HI> from <HI>Virgil;</HI> &s;o &s;ome among our own Rhimers have been renown'd for ver&s;ifying, who never &s;o much as knew that <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> were good Poets. And I can on the other &s;ide name &s;everal who never di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by Poetry, who yet have oblig'd the World with Cri|tici&s;ms which have been Non-pareillo's, and the very Top-Critick of all tho&s;e Criticks is my worthy Friend the <HI>Spectator.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' who the Devil could have ever ex|pected to have found my worthy Friend a Critick, after he had treated Criticks with &s;o much Contempt in two or three of his Immortal <HI>Tatlers,</HI> and particularly in the 29<HI>th</HI> and the 246<HI>th,</HI> where they are pronounc'd to be the &s;illie&s;t of Mor|tals, Creatures, for&s;ooth, who profe&s;s

Judgment; tho' by the way, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> he who profe&s;&s;es or practi&s;es Poetry, and does not profe&s;s Judgment in it, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf an A&s;s. It was from tho&s;e <HI>Tatlers,</HI> and one or two more, Mr. <HI>Spectator,</HI> that I gue&s;s'd that you had a mortal A ver&s;ion to Critici&s;m; but now I find plainly that they were none of your own, but were &s;ent you by two or three damn'd Poets, who are a &s;ort of Offenders that have not half the Cha|rity which other Malefactors are wont to &s;hew, but bear eternal Malice to their Ex|ecutioners.</P>
<P>Thus the Invectives again&s;t Criticks and Critici&s;m were other Peoples; you were too wi&s;e to write any &s;uch thing, as knowing that Ta&s;t which declines &s;o fa&s;t is only to be re&s;tor'd and maintain'd by Critici&s;m. And therefore in&s;tead of writing Invectives again&s;t it, you have oblig'd the World with the thing it &s;elf, with Critici&s;m upon Critici&s;m, and &s;uch Critici&s;m.&mdash;As tho&s;e <HI>Tatlers</HI> were the Off-&s;pring of &s;ome certain Poets, which is manife&s;t by their in&s;ipid Satyr, like the faint Eagerne&s;s of Vinegar decay'd: no|thing is more clear than that the Critici&s;ms could be none but yours. For as you may di&s;cover <HI>ex ungue Leonem, &amp; ex pede Her|cules,</HI> &s;o in this Ca&s;e the prodigious Off|&s;pring &s;peaks and confe&s;&s;es the Gigantick Fa|ther.</P>

the Members of the Commonwealth of Learning. But a Plagiary from living Au|thors is mo&s;t profligately impudent, and in &s;o &s;low and &s;plenatick a Nation as ours mo&s;t unju&s;t and barbarous. For among us any thing that is admirably good is twenty or thirty Years before it comes to be under|&s;tood. And how infinitely ba&s;e is it in the mean while to deprive an Author of any thing that is valuable in him, and to inter|cept his coming Prai&s;e? As Laws are made for the Security of Property, what pity 'tis that there are not &s;ome enacted for the Se|curity of a Man's Thoughts and Inventions, which alone are properly his? For Land is alienable, and Trea&s;ure is tran&s;itory, and both mu&s;t at one time or other pa&s;s from him, either by his own voluntary Act, or by the Violence and Inju&s;tice of others, or at lea&s;t by Fate. And therefore nothing is truly and really a Man's own.<Q>

<PB N="428" REF="204">
the Honour of them, yet they mu&s;t for ever rightfully belong to their fir&s;t Inventor. Thus even the riche&s;t and the happie&s;t of Men have nothing that is truly and really their own, but their Thoughts and Inven|tions. But Authors for the mo&s;t part, and e&s;pecially Poets, have nothing that can &s;o much as be call'd their own but their Thoughts. 'Tis for tho&s;e alone, and the Glory which they expect from tho&s;e, that they entirely quit their Preten&s;ions to Riches, and renounce the Pomps and Vani|ties of this wicked World; and therefore to endeavour to deprive them of tho&s;e is exceedingly inhuman. What a Joy 'tis to think that the Precedence of Times &s;ets me free from the Imputation of this Inju&s;tice? Had I been capable of doing this, and do|ing it to my worthy Friend, of wronging my deare&s;t Friend in this manner, who knows how far that Barbarity might have extended it &s;elf? I might have proceeded to have upbraided him with &s;ome weak place in his never-dying Folio's; and ha|ving forcibly depriv'd him of his Silver and his Gold, have pelted him with his Bra&s;s and his Copper, out of counterfeit Anger or pretended Scorn, becau&s;e they were of no richer Metal.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e of my dear Friend is va&s;tly different. You have that Reputation, and the World has that Opinion of your Merit,
<PB N="429" REF="205">
that they will be &s;o far from believing that you have Obligations to a living Author which you have not, that tho' you had really made thus bold with me, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have convinc'd a|bove forty or fifty People of it. And here, my dear Friend, at the &s;ame time that I acknowledge your uncommon Merit, I cannot but congratulate your incomparable Felicity, it being plain that you have got more Reputation in three Years time than <HI>Milton</HI> has done in fifty Years, or than <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has in an hundred.

<HEAD>To <HI>Matthew Prior,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> upon the <HI>Roman</HI>
Satiri&s;ts.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen you &s;eem'd to approve of the Tran&s;lation of the &s;eventh Satire of the &s;econd Book of <HI>Horace,</HI> which was tran&s;lated by one of my Friends, that Ap|probation was the more plea&s;ing to me, be|cau&s;e it confirm'd me in my own Opinion of it, and oblig'd me to acquie&s;ce in the Judgments which &s;ome of my Friends have given of it, whom I have always chiefly con&s;ulted in my Doubts about poetical Matters. And now, Sir, I come according to my Promi&s;e to con&s;ult you about the Preference which &s;everal Partizans of the <HI>Roman</HI> Satiri&s;ts have given to their re&s;pect|ive Favourite Authors, and to know from you which of them are in the right, or ra|ther whether they are not all in the wrong. You know very well, Sir, that <HI>Rigaltius, Scaliger</HI> the Elder, <HI>Lip&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Holiday</HI> prefer <HI>Juvenal</HI> to <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ius;</HI> That <HI>Dacier, Hein&s;ius,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Bruyere,</HI> and &s;everal others, prefer <HI>Horace</HI>
<PB N="431" REF="207">
to <HI>Per&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Juvenal;</HI> that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> endeavours to divide the Palm between <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juvenal,</HI> and to prefer <HI>Horace</HI> for In&s;truction, and <HI>Juvenal</HI> for Delight; that he gives <HI>Horace</HI> the Preference for In|&s;truction, becau&s;e, &s;ays he, he is the more general In&s;tructor; but that he gives the Priority to <HI>Juvenal</HI> for Delight, becau&s;e he is mo&s;t delighted with him, and &s;o makes his own Ta&s;te the Argument for preferring him. But tho' we &s;hou'd grant, Sir, that the Generality of Readers are more delighted with <HI>Juvenal</HI> than they are with <HI>Horace,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Dryden</HI> is more de|lighted with him; yet is it not very much to be que&s;tion'd, whether the Author who gives the mo&s;t general Delight is the mo&s;t delightful Author? Now Sir, your old Friend Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;preaux,</HI> tho' 'tis evi|dent that he was more pleas'd with <HI>Horace</HI> than he was with <HI>Juvenal,</HI> becau&s;e he has imitated him more, yet he had more Judg|ment than expre&s;ly to prefer the one to the other, becau&s;e he knew very well, that there can be no true Preference where there can be no ju&s;t Compari&s;on, and that there can be no ju&s;t Compari&s;on between Authors who&s;e Works are not <HI>eju&s;dem gene|ris,</HI> and that the Works of tho&s;e two Sati|ri&s;ts are not <HI>eju&s;dem generis.</HI> For do not you believe, Sir, that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> is in the wrong where he affirms that the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
<PB N="432" REF="208">
Satire had its Accompli&s;hment in <HI>Ju|venal?</HI> For is there not Rea&s;on to believe that the true <HI>Roman</HI> Satire is of the Comick kind, and was an Imitatiou of the old <HI>Athenian</HI> Comedys, in which <HI>Lucilius</HI> fir&s;t &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf, and which was afterwards perfect|ed by <HI>Horace,</HI> and that <HI>Juvenal</HI> afterwards &s;tarted a new Satire which was of the Tra|gick kind? <HI>Horace,</HI> who wrote as <HI>Lucilius</HI> had done before him, in Imitation of the old Comedy, endeavours to correct the Follies and Errors, and epidemick Vices of his Readers, which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Co|medy. <HI>Juvenal</HI> attacks the pernicious out|ragious Pa&s;&s;ions and the abominable mon|&s;trous Crimes of &s;everal of his Contempo|raries, or of tho&s;e who liv'd in the Age be|fore him, which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Trage|dy, at lea&s;t of imperfect Tragedy. <HI>Horace</HI> argues, in&s;inuates, engages, rallies, &s;miles; <HI>Juvenal</HI> exclaims, apo&s;trophizes, exagge|rates, la&s;hes, &s;tabbs. There is in <HI>Horace</HI> al|mo&s;t every where an agreeable Mixture of good Sen&s;e, and of true Plea&s;antry, &s;o that he has every where the principal Qualities of an excellent Comick Poet. And there is almo&s;t every where in <HI>Juvenal,</HI> Anger, Indignation, Rage, Di&s;dain, and the vio|lent Emotions and vehement Style of Tra|gedy. Can there then be a ju&s;t Compari|&s;on made between the&s;e two Satiri&s;ts, any more than there can be between a Tragick
<PB N="433" REF="209">
and a Comick Poet? If Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> were now living, would he compare <HI>Nat Lee</HI> with <HI>Etherege,</HI> the former of which never touch'd upon Comedy, and the other never attempted Tragedy? would he prefer <HI>Nat Lee</HI> to <HI>Etherege,</HI> as he does <HI>Juvenal</HI> to <HI>Horace,</HI> becau&s;e the Thoughts of <HI>Lee</HI> are more elevated than tho&s;e of <HI>Etherege,</HI> his Expre&s;&s;ions more noble and more &s;ono|rous, his Ver&s;e more numerous, and his Words more &s;ublime and lofty? would he not have believ'd, that if <HI>Etherege</HI> had writ Sir <HI>Fopling</HI> in the &s;ame Style, that <HI>Nat Lee</HI> wrote <HI>Alexander,</HI> he would have been as merry a Per&s;on as <HI>Penketh|man</HI> was when he acted <HI>Alexander?</HI> Would he not in all probability have judg'd that <HI>Lee</HI> is more delightful to tho&s;e who are more pleas'd with Tra|gedy than they are with Comedy, and that <HI>Etherege</HI> is more delightful to tho&s;e who are better entertain'd with Comedy than they are with Tragedy? Now, Sir, ought not we to make the &s;ame Judgment of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juvenal,</HI> and to affirm <HI>Ho|race</HI> to be more delightful to tho&s;e who are more pleas'd with Comedy than they are with Tragedy, and that <HI>Juvenal</HI> is more delightful to tho&s;e who are better entertain'd with Tragedy than they are with Comedy? And that perhaps for that very rea&s;on he was more plea&s;ing than
<PB N="434" REF="210">
<HI>Horace</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dryden?</HI> Will not the Tra|gick Satire, which like Tragedy fetches its Notions from Philo&s;ophy and from com|mon Sen&s;e, be in all probability more ac|ceptable to Univer&s;ities and Cloi&s;ters, and all tho&s;e Reclu&s;e and Contemplative Men, who pa&s;s mo&s;t of their time in their Clo|&s;ets, all which Per&s;ons are &s;uppos'd to have Philo&s;ophy from Study, and common Sen&s;e from Nature? And will not the Co|mick Satiri&s;t, who owes no &s;mall Part of his Excellence to his Experience, that is to the Knowledge of the Conver&s;ation and Manners of the Men of the World, be in all likelihood more agreeable to the di&s;|cerning Part of a Court, and a great Capi|tal, where they are qualify'd to ta&s;te and di&s;cern his Beauties, by the &s;ame Experi|ence which enabled their Authors to pro|duce them? And above all things, mu&s;t it not be mo&s;t agreeable to a Polite Court, where that dexterous In&s;inuation, that fine good Sen&s;e, and that true Plea&s;antry which are united in the <HI>Horatian</HI> Satire are the only &s;hining Qualities which make the Courtier valuable and agreeable? And will he not take more delight in the <HI>Hora|tian</HI> Satire than in the Tragick Eloquence of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> not only becau&s;e he is quali|fied by Nature and Experience to reli&s;h the Beauties of it, but becau&s;e the Plea|&s;ure which he receives from it, is &s;ub&s;er+vient
<PB N="435" REF="211">
to his Intere&s;t, which is always his main De&s;ign, and Improves and Cultivates tho&s;e Talents which are chiefly to recom|mend him to tho&s;e who are to advance him?</P>
<P>It will be needle&s;s, Sir, to detain you any longer, by enquiring into the Prefe|rence which <HI>Ca&s;aubon</HI> has &s;o injudiciou&s;ly given to <HI>Per&s;ius</HI> above <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juve|nal,</HI> or into the Preference which he par|ticularly gives to the fifth Satire of <HI>Per&s;ius</HI> before this of <HI>Horace,</HI> the Tran&s;lation of which has occa&s;ion'd the Trouble which I now give you, and which, you know, Sir, is writ upon the &s;ame Subject. Your Friend, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier,</HI> tells us that <HI>Ca&s;aubon</HI> by this Opinion prefers the Uni|ver&s;ity to the Court. I appeal to you, Sir, if the Satire of <HI>Horace,</HI> the Tran&s;lation of which comes after this Letter, does not &s;peak for it &s;elf, and ju&s;tifie the A&s;&s;ertion of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>

<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have lately, with a great deal of Satis|faction, read twice over the political Letters to the Author of the <HI>London</HI> Jour|nal. Several of them &s;eem to come from no ordinary Hands, being writ with great Strength and Spirit. The great Occa&s;ion certainly call'd for all the Strength and Spi|rit that could be &s;upplied by Man. 'Tis indeed &s;o extraordinary, that it has no Pa|rallel in any Nation or any Age: For that a great Number of the chief Inhabitants of the Metropolis of a powerful Kingdom, who were &s;o far from having any Cau&s;e of Di&s;content, that they had in their Power all the Felicity that Mortals can enjoy; that they actually po&s;&s;e&s;s'd more than ever they dar'd to hope for, nay more than e|ver they dar'd to wi&s;h for, ev'n in their mo&s;t &s;anguine Hours, but a few Months be|fore; That Per&s;ons who were e&s;teemed by all their Fellow-Citizens, re&s;pected by all their Fellow-Subjects, regarded and highly favour'd by the Government, and honour'd
<PB N="462" REF="236">
and di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the whole Legi&s;lature; that a Number of the&s;e &s;hould enter into an execrable Con&s;piracy, irretrievably to ruin their Fellow-Subjects, to di&s;tre&s;s the Government that had &s;o highly favour'd them, and to afflict and perplex the whole Legi&s;lature that had &s;o highly honour'd them; and all this only thro' the infinitely ba&s;e and fooli&s;h De&s;ire of accumulating Riches, of which they had before more than they could ever u&s;e, is what has never been tran&s;mitted to us by Tradition, or read of in ancient or modern Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>This Con&s;piracy, &s;o new and unheard-of that it cannot be equal'd by any Nation in any Age, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a Cau&s;e as mon&s;trous and as unparallel'd; and that is an antecedent Con&s;piracy among a great num|ber of People, &s;ome by conver&s;ing and by writing, and &s;ome by encouraging the&s;e Conver&s;ations and Writings, to overthrow the Religion of their native Countrey, and by that means to let in Corruption upon us like a Deluge. And this they have en|deavour'd with all their Might to do, upon a Pretence the mo&s;t extravagant that was ever heard of, upon a Pretence to advance the Publick Good. For their De&s;ign was to overthrow the Chri&s;tian Religion, in or|der to de&s;troy Prie&s;tcraft; at the &s;ame Time they make no Offer to e&s;tabli&s;h any other Religion in the Room of that which
<PB N="463" REF="237">
they would de&s;troy. Now Prie&s;tcraft may trouble and perplex a State, but a general Want of Religion mu&s;t be attended with its utter Ruin. For the Religion of every Countrey in which the Natives and their Forefathers have been educated, and which is antecedent or coaeval to mo&s;t of its Laws and Cu&s;toms, that Religion, whether true or fal&s;e, is certainly the Ba&s;is of that Coun|try's Con&s;titution; and may indeed, when Corruptions flow in upon it, be reform'd, and reduc'd to its fir&s;t Principles; but can never be totally aboli&s;h'd, without unavoida|ble Ruin. For that national Religion is, to that Countrey, the only Fountain both of general publick and private Virtue, and of general publick Siprit; and that being aboli&s;h'd, or very much weaken'd, even natural Religion mu&s;t lo&s;e its Force, and con&s;equently there can be no general Mo|rality. For tho' our Antichri&s;tian Authors may make &s;everal of their Readers Athei&s;ts, they can never hope to make the Genera|lity of a Nation Thei&s;ts, without preten|ding to infu&s;e more Under&s;tanding into them than God and Nature ordain'd for them. For the Bulk of Mankind in any Nation, that is the Pea&s;ants, the Mechanicks, and the Rabble of Gentry, are not capable of Thei&s;m, that is of wor&s;hipping, without a &s;en&s;ible vi&s;ible Mediator, a Spirit who fills infinite Space; or of being convinc'd of their Duty by Arguments form'd by

right Rea&s;on, and drawn from the Laws of Nature. The Bulk of Mankind are en|tirely &s;way'd by their Pa&s;&s;ions, and e&s;peci|ally by tho&s;e two pow'rful ones, Hope, and Fear, for which Rea&s;on all tho&s;e fam'd Politicians, who have had the greate&s;t Knowledge of Mankind, have advis'd the Rulers of Nations to govern them by tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Hope of Re|ward, and by the Fear of Puni&s;hment; and here I cannot forbear reciting the memora|ble Words of the great Cardinal <HI>Richlieu.</HI> He begins the fir&s;t Chapter of the &s;econd Part of his political Te&s;tament thus:<Q><P>'Tis a common but true Saying, and there|fore the more true, becau&s;e it has been al|ways in the Mouths and Minds of all Man|kind, that Puni&s;hment and Reward are the two mo&s;t important things to be ob&s;erv'd in the Government of any State.</P> 
<P>Nay 'tis mo&s;t certain, that tho' no other Maxim &s;hould be made u&s;e of in the Govern|ment of States, than that of being inflexible in cha&s;ti&s;ing tho&s;e who di&s;&s;erve them, and religious in recompen&s;ing tho&s;e who procure for them any con&s;iderable Advantage, they could not be ill govern'd; there being no Man whatever who is not capable of being kept within the Bounds of his Duty by Fear and by Hope</P></Q></P>
<P>'Tis after the &s;ame manner that Religion works upon the Minds of Men. The Re|ligion
<PB N="465" REF="239">
of the Old Te&s;tament &s;peaks &s;trong|ly to the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions, propo&s;ing mighty temporal Rewards to tho&s;e who ob&s;erve the Rules of it, and to tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s them grievous temporal Puni&s;hments.

<P>Now when the Generality of Mankind break loo&s;e from that Hope and that Fear, they remain ab&s;olutely without Religion, and are prepar'd to di&s;&s;emble them&s;elves of any that may gratify their Ambition, their Intere&s;t, or their Revenge; which was the Cau&s;e that in the two or three la&s;t Years of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> &s;o many cry'd out that they had rather turn Papi&s;ts than be Pre&s;|byterians.

<HEAD>TO Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Approbation which you gave to my former, incourages me to proceed. I affirmed in that, that the Religion of every Country, the e&s;tabli&s;h'd ancient Religion, is the Ba&s;is of the Con&s;titution of that Coun|try. I make no doubt but that if any Re|ligion except the <HI>Mahometan</HI> were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in <HI>Turkey,</HI> that ab&s;olute Monarchy would be &s;peedily ruin'd. That mighty Empire will certainly decay, as the Influence of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion grows weaker. But what is here affirm'd of Kingdoms and States in general, may be &s;aid more parti|cularly of Free States. Their Liberty and their Greatne&s;s equally depend upon the Influence of the Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed in them. When once the various Sects of Philo|&s;ophers at <HI>Athens</HI> had generally weaken'd the Influence which the <HI>Graecian</HI> Religion before had had on the Minds of the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI> they were no longer that brave and
<PB N="469" REF="243">
that noble People who fought for the com|mon Liberty of <HI>Greece</HI> at <HI>Salamis</HI> and at <HI>Marathon:</HI> They were no longer that great People who were all on fire with the Thir&s;t of Glory, and were fonder of Liberty than of Life; the &s;ordid Love of Gold took the Place in their Souls of tho&s;e two noble Pa&s;|&s;ions. And they who in the Days of <HI>Mil|tiades</HI> and <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> &s;corn'd to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t formidable Power on Earth, as &s;oon as their Philo&s;ophy had got the better of their Religion were ready to &s;ubmit and betray their Countrey to a petty up&s;tart In|vader. If we look among the <HI>Romans,</HI> we &s;hall find &s;till more illu&s;trious Proofs of the Influence that Religion has upon the Pub|lick Welfare. <HI>Machiavel</HI> attributes all the Felicity of that State to the Religion e&s;tabli|&s;hed among them by <HI>Numa, who finding,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Machiavel, a very fierce People, and be|ing de&s;irous to reduce them to civil Obedi|ence by peaceable ways, applied him&s;elf to Religion, as a thing wholly nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve civil Society, and ordered it in &s;uch a manner, that for many Ages there was not &s;uch a Fear of God as in that Common|wealth, which facilitated much any Enter|prize what&s;oever, which either the Senate or tho&s;e brave</HI> Roman <HI>Courages did under|take. Di&s;c. on</HI> Livy. Lib. 1. ch. 11. And a little lower in the &s;ame Chapter he adds, <HI>If a Man con&s;iders well the</HI> Roman <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI>
<PB N="470" REF="244">
<HI>he &s;hall find of how much Efficacy their Re|ligion was for the commanding of Armies, for the reconciling the Senate and People, for the pre&s;erving good Men, and for morti|fying the lewd. So that if we were to di&s;|pute to which of the two Princes</HI> Rome <HI>was more oblig'd, to</HI> Romulus <HI>or</HI> Numa, <HI>I believe</HI> Numa <HI>would be preferred; for where Religion is, military Di&s;cipline is ea&s;ily introduced; and where they have no Re|ligion and are already warlike, this hardly follows.</HI></P>
<P>The Authority of <HI>Machiavel</HI> is &s;o very great in political Matters, that I cannot for|bear the quoting him once more in this ve|ry Chapter, who a little lower has the&s;e Words; <HI>Wherefore having well con&s;ider'd all, I conclude, that the Religion introdu|ced by</HI> Numa, <HI>was one of the principal Oc|ca&s;ions of that City's Happine&s;s, for that caus'd good Orders, good Orders brought good Fortune, and all the happy Succe&s;&s;es of their Enterprizes; and as the Ob&s;er|vance of Divine Wor&s;hip occa&s;ions the Great|ne&s;s of a Commonwealth, &s;o the Contempt of it de&s;troys it. For where the Fear of God is wanting, it mu&s;t needs be that either that Kingdom goes to Ruine, or that it be &s;up|ported by the Awe it &s;tands in of the Prince, who may &s;upply the Defects of Religion; and becau&s;e Princes are but &s;hort-liv'd, that</HI><PB N="471" REF="245">
<HI>Kingdom mu&s;t needs have an End quickly, according as the Virtue thereof fails.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Sir, if the Religion which <HI>Nu|ma</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd among the <HI>Romans,</HI> was the principal Cau&s;e of the Felicity of that Com|monwealth, I de&s;ire to know whether any thing which had a direct and natural Ten|dency to the weakening and overturning that Religion, had not as direct and natu|ral a Tendency to the weakening and de|&s;troying the Commonwealth. There are particularly three things in the <HI>Roman</HI> Re|ligion, which &s;eem to me to have had a pe|culiar Influence upon the Happine&s;s of that Commonwealth. The fir&s;t is, the pretended Apparition of <HI>Romulus</HI> to <HI>Proculus,</HI> when he informed him of his Apotheo&s;is, and a&s;|&s;ur'd him, if his <HI>Romans</HI> applied them&s;elves to Arms, they &s;hould become the Ma&s;ters of the Univer&s;e. Now as you know very well, Sir, that the <HI>Romans</HI> firmly believ'd this, what cou'd infu&s;e more Confidence and Spirit into them in their Battels than that Belief?</P>
<P>But, Sir, you know very well, that the &s;econd thing which had a peculiar Influ|ence upon the Felicity of the <HI>Roman</HI> Re|publick, was their Divinations by the Flight of Birds, the Entrails of Bea&s;ts, and the pecking of Chickens, <HI>&amp;c. The Sooth&s;ay|ings,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Machiavel,</HI> Ch. the 1&s;t. Lib. the 1&s;t. of his Di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>were not only for</HI>
<PB N="472" REF="246">
<HI>the mo&s;t part (as we have before ob&s;erv'd) the Ground of the ancient Pagan Religion, but they were al&s;o the Occa&s;ion of the</HI> Roman <HI>Republick's Welfare. For which Rea&s;on the</HI> Romans <HI>had more Regard to them than to any Order be&s;ides, and made u&s;e of them in their Con&s;ular A&s;&s;emblies, in the Begin|nings of their Enterpri&s;es, in drawing forth their Armies into the Field, in fighting of pitch'd Battels, and in any other important Action either Civilor Military. Nor ever would they undertake any Expedition till they had fir&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd the Soldiers that the Gods had promis'd them the Victory. For,</HI> &s;ays he, at the end of this &s;ame Chapter, &s;peaking of the Divination by the pecking of Chickens, <HI>there was no other end of this manner of Sooth&s;aying than to encourage the Soldiers to fight, for Boldne&s;s always wins the Victory.</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, a third thing which more than any thing had an Influence upon the Feli|city of that Commonwealth was what we find in the <HI>Somnium Scipionis</HI> of <HI>Cicero. Sed, quo &s;is, Africane, alacrior ad tutan|dam Rempublicam, &s;ic habeto: Omnibus qui patriam con&s;ervaverint, adjuverint, auxe|rint, certum e&s;&s;e in coelo ac de finitum Locum, ubi beati, aevo &s;empiterno fruantur.</HI> Is it not probable, Sir, that mo&s;t of their great Actions proceeded from a Belief of this, or el&s;e that &s;ome of them were downright
<PB N="473" REF="247">
Fanatici&s;m? We find by <HI>Diony&s;ius Hallicar|na&s;&s;aeus,</HI> that the Belief of this was the chief Motive that determined <HI>Vetturia,</HI> the Mo|ther of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> to endeavour, among &s;o many di&s;couraging Circum&s;tances, to prevail upon her Son to draw off his Army from the Walls of <HI>Rome,</HI> and not to de&s;troy his Country.</P>
<P><HI>If I carry back to</HI> Rome, &s;ays &s;he to her Son, <HI>the hope of a &s;peedy Peace, if I re|turn to it with the A&s;&s;urance that you are reconciled to it, with what Tran&s;ports of Joy &s;hall I not be receiv'd by our Fellow Citizens? The &s;mall Remainder of time which I am prede&s;tin'd by the Gods to pa&s;s upon Earth, will be attended with unpa|rallell'd Glory. And when the Gods put an end to my Life, my Happine&s;s will have no end. And if it be true, that there are dif|ferent Man&s;ions doom'd for us after we are dead, I &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to fear tho&s;e dark and di&s;mal Places prepared for the Souls of the wicked; even the</HI> Eli&s;ian <HI>Fields, tho&s;e charming Retreats prede&s;tin'd for the Souls of the Ju&s;t, will be too poor a Re|compence to reward De&s;ert like mine. Af|ter I &s;hall have pre&s;erved</HI> Rome, <HI>this City &s;o dear to</HI> Jupiter, <HI>I &s;hall be encourag'd to expect a Place in that pure and &s;ublime Re|gion of the Air, which, we are told, is in|habited by the Children of Gods.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="248">
The&s;e, Sir, were the three Points of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, which had the greate&s;t Influence on the Publick Succe&s;s and the Pro&s;perity of their Commonwealth. But when at length the <HI>Graecian</HI> Philo&s;ophy was brought into <HI>Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI> began to think, what the Moderns call freely, <HI>the Sy&s;tem of</HI> Epicurus, which mo&s;t prevailed with the Men of Letters and the Men of Vanity, appear'd to be directly levell'd at the three foremention'd Points of their Re|ligion, and to have a direct Tendency to the rooting the Belief of them from the Minds of Men. For whereas the funda|mental Maxim of <HI>Epicurus</HI>'s <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> is, that the Gods never in the lea&s;t concern them|&s;elves about the Affairs of the World, they who receive it, mu&s;t refu&s;e all Credit to the Apparition of <HI>Romulus</HI> to <HI>Proculus,</HI> after the former's pretended Apotheo&s;is. And whereas 'tis a Maxim of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> that the World is ab&s;olutely govern'd by Chance, and that the very Pretence to Divination is nothing but a &s;olemn Foppery; this alone was &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the Influence of their Aru&s;picy and their Augury. And then, how is the Expectation of a bli&s;sful and a glorious di&s;tingui&s;h'd Immortality, con&s;i&s;tent with that third <HI>Epicurean</HI> Max|im, that the Soul dies with the Body?</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, did the Frec-thinking of the <HI>Romans</HI> weaken their Belief of tho&s;e Points
<PB N="475" REF="249">
of their Religion, which were the three principal Sources of their Virtue and their Magnanimity, and fatally prepar'd the way for unheard-of Luxury and all manner of Vice and Corruption. I know very well indeed that this Luxury and this Corrupti|on is attributed by their Hi&s;torians to their <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Triumphs, and that fatal Security into which they were lull'd by the De&s;tru|ction of <HI>Carthage.</HI> But let us con&s;ider the Words which one of them u&s;es upon that Occa&s;ion. 'Tis <HI>Velleius Paterculus</HI> in the beginning of his &s;econd Book. <HI>Potentiae Romanorum prior Scipio viam aperuerat, Luxuriae po&s;terior aperuit. Quippe re|moto Carthaginis metu, &s;ublat&acirc;que imperii aemul&acirc;, non gradu, &s;ed praecipiti cur&s;u, a virtute De&s;citum, ad vitia Tran&s;cur&s;um; vetus Di&s;ciplina de&s;erta, nova inducta; in &s;omnum a vigiliis, ab armis ad voluptates, a negotiis in otium conver&s;a civitas.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, that the Hi&s;torian here ob|&s;erves, that upon the De&s;truction of <HI>Car|thage,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> did not pa&s;s gradually from Virtue to Vice, but took a Headlong Leap from the former to the latter. Now if 'tis truly &s;aid of particular Per&s;ons, that <HI>Nemo repente fit turpi&s;&s;imus,</HI> as I make no doubt but that it is very true, 'tis certainly more unque&s;tionably true of a whole and a great People. If therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> upon the De&s;truction of <HI>Carthage,</HI> preci|pitately
<PB N="476" REF="250">
broke out into all manner of Vice and Corruption; there is no way in Nature to account for this but by truly af|firming, that their Inclinations were de|bauch'd long before the De&s;truction of <HI>Car|thage,</HI> and that the Ruin of that Rival Ci|ty did nothing but take off that Re&s;traint which had been upon them before; that their Principles of Religion and Vir|tue had been attack'd and weaken'd for a whole Century before, by the loo&s;e Philo|&s;ophy of <HI>Greece,</HI> which had been introdu|ced among them about the beginning of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> War.</P>
<P>I could bring In&s;tances from &s;everal o|ther Kingdoms and States to &s;hew the In|fluence which Religion has upon their good or their evil Fortune. But enough has been &s;aid upon a Subject of which the rea|&s;onable part of Mankind is &s;atisfied, and e&s;pecially all the great Men who have lived in every Age. For all the great Legi&s;la|tors who have been famous among the Na|tions for the wi&s;e Laws they e&s;tabli&s;hed, have either been really religious, or havepre|tended to be &s;o. <HI>For never,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Machi|avel, was there any Maker of extraordi|nary Laws in a Nation, who had not his Recour&s;e to God, for otherwi&s;e his Laws had not been received. For &s;everal things that are good and expedient are known to a wi&s;e Man, which have not &s;uch Evidence in</HI>
<PB N="477" REF="251">
<HI>them&s;elves, that he by Di&s;cour&s;e can ea&s;ily make others conceive them. Therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the wi&s;e Men who would get over this Dif|ficulty, have Recour&s;e to a God, &s;o had</HI> Lycurgus, <HI>&s;o</HI> Solon, <HI>&s;o many others who&s;e De&s;ign was the &s;ame with theirs.</HI> All the great Founders of Kingdoms and States have been either really or appearingly re|ligious. And therefore as Empire is main|tain'd by the &s;ame Methods by which it was at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd, there is no Precept that <HI>Machiavel</HI> in&s;tills with &s;o much Care into the Prince of his Formation, as that he &s;hould at lea&s;t appear religious; as any one may be &s;atisfied, who has Recour&s;e to the 13<HI>th</HI> Chapter of his Prince. All the Con|querors of the World have brought about their De&s;igns by Religion. Ev'n <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> him|&s;elf, tho' a manife&s;t <HI>Epicurean,</HI> pretended to be of divine Extraction, and in order to animate his Souldiers by that Belief, the very Word which he gave at the deci&s;ive Battel of <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> was <HI>Venus Victrix.</HI></P>
<P>But as the Legi&s;lators, and Founders, and Conquerors of Empires have had Recour&s;e to Religion for the e&s;tabli&s;hing or encrea&s;ing their Empire; all the wi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h'd Prin|ces that have ever reign'd, and all the great Mini&s;ters who have &s;erv'd them, have thought Religion nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;er|ving that Empire which had been at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd by it.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="252">
Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> in the beginning of the &s;ixth Chapter of the fir&s;t Part of his Politi|cal Te&s;tament, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus to <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th.</HI><Q>Dieu etant le Principe des toutes cho&s;es, le Souverain Ma&icirc;tre des Rois, et celuy &s;eul qui les fait regner heureu&s;ement, &s;i la De|votion D.

<P>And thus, Sir, have I endeavoour'd to &s;hew that the re&s;pective Religion of ev'ry Coun|try is the Ba&s;is of the Con&s;titution of that Countrey, which as I have endeavour'd to prove by Rea&s;on in the former Letter, I have pretended to confirm it in this by infallible Experience and Matter of Fact, by the Authority of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> who is generally regarded as the Prince of Political Writers; by the Sentiments of wi&s;e Legi&s;lators, of the great Foun|ders of Empires and great Conquerors; by the Practice of all wi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h'd Prin|ces, and the Sentiments and Practice of

all the great Mini&s;ters, who have &s;erv'd them. There is no manner of Occa&s;ion to tell a Gentleman of your good Sen&s;e, that by Religion, all along in the&s;e Let|ters, is meant not only reveal'd Religion, but the Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed in every Country: But I thought fit to give at lea&s;t a Hint of this for the Sake of o|thers, into who&s;e Hands this Letter may come.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, what &s;hall we &s;ay of a certain Sett of Per&s;ons, who for the&s;e la&s;t thirty Years have made it the &s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Lives, not only to &s;hew all the World that they are irreligious them&s;elves, and vainly value them&s;elves upon it, but to endeavour to root out the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion from the Minds of others; and at the &s;ame Time to pretend that they do this for the pub|lick Good, and to &s;trengthen the Re|volution; which &s;uch a Proceeding has a natural Tendency to de&s;troy, as we &s;hew'd in our former Letter. Some of the&s;e are the very Per&s;ons who cry out with the greate&s;t Vehemence again&s;t tho&s;e who have been guilty of that deplorable Cor|ruption, and that fatal Villany, which have almo&s;t undone a great and powerful Na|tion.

ob&s;erve that as the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion in every Country is the Ba&s;is of the Con&s;titution of that Country, &s;o no Religion that ever was in the World ever made it &s;o much its De&s;ign as the Chri&s;tian Religion does, to extirpate Avarice and all worldly Intere&s;t out of the Minds of Men. The Founder of this Religion has more than once decla|red that his Kingdom is not of this World, and that they who will be his Subjects, who&s;e Hearts and Affections he ab&s;olutely requires, mu&s;t renounce the Prince of this World, and ev'ry thing that is his; and he has taken the utmo&s;t Care both by his Example, and by his Doctrine, to bani&s;h Avarice and all worldly Intere&s;t from the Minds of his Followers; for which Rea&s;on, his whole Life was one continu'd Example of a contented and willing Poverty. <HI>The Foxes have Holes,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and the Birds of the Air have Ne&s;ts, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head. Matthew</HI> Chap. 8. V. 20. He made this his principal Care in his Doctrine, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd his Re|ligion upon this Foundation. <HI>Mat.</HI> 14. Chap. 14. V. 21. Je&s;us <HI>&s;aid unto him, if thou wilt be perfect, go and &s;ell what thou ha&s;t, and give to the Poor; and thou &s;halt have Trea&s;ure in Heaven, and</HI>
<PB N="483" REF="257">
<HI>come and follow me.</HI> And when the young Man, to whom this was &s;aid went away &s;orrowful, becau&s;e he had great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Ibid.</HI> V. 26. <HI>It is ea&s;ier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> That is, It is ea&s;ier for a Camel to go thro' the Eye of a Needle, than for a Man who loves the Riches of this World to become a Subject of &s;uch a Soveraign of another World, as requires all his Af|fections.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles by their Lives gave the &s;ame Example that their Ma&s;ter did. <HI>Matthew</HI> 19. V. 23. <HI>Behold, we have for&s;aken all and followed thee.</HI> As they gave the &s;ame Example, they preach'd the &s;ame Doctrine. St. <HI>Paul</HI> has declar'd Avarice to be Idolatry, that is, 'tis &s;etting tho&s;e Affections upon &s;ordid Dirt, who&s;e rightful Object is God alone. As the End of the Chri&s;tian Religion is to re|&s;tore Man to that bli&s;sful Immortality, from which the Fall degraded him; this can be done no other way than by re|&s;toring tho&s;e Affections to God, which Man at his Fall withdrew from his Crea|tor, and fix'd upon the Creature. And therefore the whole Tenour of the Chri|&s;tian Religion, the whole Spirit and
<PB N="484" REF="258">
Soul of it, declare this End aloud. The three Cardinal Virtues of this Religion are utterly incompatible with Avarice and Worldly mindedne&s;s. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible but that any one who has a lively Faith, and a lively Hope in the Promi&s;e of a bli&s;sful Immortality, mu&s;t &s;et his Affections on things above, and not on things below; and as for the greate&s;t of the three Vir|tues Charity, that and Avarice mu&s;t be the very Contradictions of each other, in their Natures, their De&s;igns, their Effects, and their very Terms.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, that it is pretty plain, that where a Religion thus con&s;tituted flouri&s;hes, it mu&s;t be attended with great Di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s and with publick Virtue. When upon the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> it was in its full Power, we read of the grea|te&s;t Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s that ever was heard of, <HI>Acts</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> And ev'n here among us when it was reduc'd to its fir&s;t Principles up|on the Reformation, there was a good deal of publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and there never has been &s;o little publick Spirit among us, as &s;ince the Return of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and never &s;o fierce and frequent Attacks again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion; and as tho&s;e Attacks have been more frequent and more audacious within the&s;e la&s;t thirty Years, the national Virtue and publick
<PB N="485" REF="259">
Spirit have declin'd proportionably, and A|varice and Corruption increas'd. And now they are arriv'd at their fatal Height, we find that they who are believ'd to be mo&s;t guilty of them, are they who have been the great and the con&s;tant Favourers of tho&s;e who made the Attacks.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, as I have &s;hewn that the undermining the Chri&s;tian Religion has had a natural Tendency to the weakning the na|tional Virtue and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Govern|ment; what Acknowledgments &s;hall we make to you who have been for &s;o many Years a Champion for the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Reli|gion, and who by endeavouring all that lay in your &s;ingle Power to &s;temm this Torrent of impolitick Impiety, have like a true Pa|triot been employ'd in the Service of your Country, and making a generous Effort for the re&s;toring publick Virtue and publick Spi|rit. And as one of the noble&s;t Branches of the publick Wor&s;hip, by the Di&s;advantage of a barbarous Tran&s;lation, lay but too much ex|pos'd to the Scorn and Contempt of Liber|tines; you have bravely re&s;cu'd it from that Oppre&s;&s;ion; and by giving us a new Tran&s;la|tion confin'd to the old Tunes and Mea&s;ures, (a Tran&s;lation valuable to the Knowing, and intelligible to the Ignorant) have put it in our Power to e&s;tabli&s;h an Uniformity of Prai&s;e in our Wor&s;hip, as we have done of
<PB N="486" REF="260">
Prayer. Whereas at pre&s;ent, one Pari&s;h differing from another in P&s;almody, the Sojourner and the Traveller, when they oc|ca&s;ionally come into our Churches, are but too often excluded from joyning in the mo&s;t &s;ublime Branch of our Wor&s;hip. For Pray|er is too often a poor &s;elf-intere&s;ted thing in Compari&s;on of Prai&s;e. For Prayer is too often the Effect of Fear and of a mean Opinion of the Deity, &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;ing him to be mutable, and &s;ometimes unju&s;t. But Prai&s;e proceeds from nobler Motives, and from nobler Pa&s;&s;ions; from a ravi&s;hing View of his Excellence, from Gratitude, from Admiration, from Joy divine and from Seraphick Love. Thus, Sir, have I &s;ent you a &s;imple Sketch of what I intended to &s;ay upon this Subject. For the Spirits will tire as well as the Limbs, and mine are al|ready weary.</P>
