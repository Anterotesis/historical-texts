<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the rece&s;s of Parliament, when Mr. Burke has no authority to interfere in his &s;enatorial character, in the concerns of any public body in the kingdom; he has addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the Chairman of the Ea&s;t India Company, to the following effect:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"That he has heard, and that the report is generally credited, that Mr. Shore is in nomination, or actually appointed, to the office of Governor General of Bengal.&mdash;<PB N="ii" REF="3">
That, having been appointed by the Hou&s;e of Commons, a Member of the Com|mittee, to impeach one of their late Go|vernors General, he thinks it his duty to inform the Chairman, that in the ex|erci&s;e of the functions impo&s;ed on that Committee by the Hou&s;e, they had found Mr. Shore to be materially con|cerned <HI>as a principal actor and party in certain of the offences charged upon Mr. Ha&s;tings</HI>; namely, in the mal-admini&s;|tration of the Revenue Board; of which, under Mr. Ha&s;tings, he was for &s;ome con|&s;iderable time the acting Chief.</P>
<P>"That he thinks it incumbent upon him al&s;o to inform the Chairman, that &s;ome of the matters charged as mi&s;demeanors, <HI>in which it appears that Mr. Shore was concerned,</HI> are actually in evidence before the Lords.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4">
"That other facts of a very &s;trong nature, which the Managers for the Commons <HI>have opened as offences,</HI> are upon the Com|pany's records; copies of which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Managers, and, that they go <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly to affect Mr. Shore's ad|mini&s;tration, as acting Chief of the Revenue Board.</HI></P>
<P>"That, the Committee of Managers can|not con&s;i&s;tently with their duty, in making good the charge confided to them by the Hou&s;e of Commons, avoid a proceeding on tho&s;e matters, or taking &s;uch &s;teps, both for &s;upporting the evidence already before the Peers, as well as putting the other, and not le&s;s important matters, into &s;uch a cour&s;e of proceeding, as the ends of ju&s;tice and the public policy may require. That the Managers have not in any in&s;tance deviated from their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">
"That, in this &s;ituation, it is for the Court of Directors to con&s;ider the con|&s;equences, <HI>which po&s;&s;ibly may follow,</HI> from &s;ending out in offices of the highe&s;t rank, and of the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible power, <HI>per&s;ons who&s;e conduct appearing on their own records, is, at the fir&s;t view of it, very reprehen&s;ible; and again&s;t whom &s;uch criminal matter, on &s;uch grounds, in a manner &s;o &s;olemn, and by men acting under &s;uch an authority as that of the Hou&s;e of Commons, is partly at i&s;&s;ue, and the re&s;t opened and offered before the highe&s;t Tribunal in the nation.</HI>"</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Burke, in the fir&s;t paragraph of his letter appears to be ignorant of what every man knew, who looked into a new&s;paper, a month ago.</P>
<P>On the 18th of September the intended appointment of Sir John Shore was announced. On the 25th he was unanimou&s;ly appointed.
<PB N="v" REF="6">
On the 2d of October his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to create him a Baronet of Great Britain; &s;o that he came under that de&s;crip|tion of per&s;ons, whom, to u&s;e Mr. Burke's words, <Q REND="inline">"The King delighteth to honour"</Q> and we &s;hould have imagined, that &s;o loyal a &s;ubject as Mr. Burke, would have delighted to know the King's plea&s;ure. On the 3d of October Sir John Shore ki&s;&s;ed hands on his creation, and on his appointment; and dined on that day with the Court of Direc|tors, and the King's Mini&s;ters. On the 11th of October he was at the Queen's Drawing-Room. On the 12th he left London. On the 14th, the day Mr. Burke's letter is dated, he was at Bath, and quitted it, to proceed to to Falmouth, on the 17th.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Burke is &s;o much in the woods, that he heard not one &s;ingle word of the&s;e &s;everal circum&s;tances, though he does &s;ay, that the account is generally credited, of his being in nomination, <HI>or actually appointed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7">If he believed the la&s;t repeat, he very well <HI>knew,</HI> that, whether the <HI>fir&s;t idea</HI> of Sir John Shore's appointment originated in Leaden|hall-&s;treet, in Mr. Dundas's apartments, at Somer&s;et Hou&s;e, or at Mr. Pitt's &s;eat at Holwood; it could <HI>only</HI> be <HI>made</HI> with the <HI>full, complete, and entire approbation of the King and his Mini&s;ters.</HI> The public mu&s;t look to Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas for the propriety of Sir John Shore's appointment. Mr. Burke's letter is therefore a direct attack upon tho&s;e mini&s;ters; whom he has ventured to threaten with the future vengeance of Parliament, for preferring a man who&s;e con|duct <HI>he,</HI> and <HI>he alone,</HI> has repre&s;ented as, at the fir&s;t view of it, <HI>very reprehen&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>We are confident that &s;o &s;trong an in|&s;tance of pre&s;umption, in an individual, is not to be met with. Mr. Burke has no right at this moment to u&s;e the name or authority of the Hou&s;e of Commons, for
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
any purpo&s;e whatever; &s;till le&s;s, for that of intimidation. Either his letter was intended to &s;top Sir John Shore's appointment, to annul it, if it had taken place&mdash;or it was an unmeaning rhap&s;ody. But, Mr. Burke does not know that the Hou&s;e will <HI>re-appoint</HI> him a Manager. It is even po&s;&s;ible, that the Hou&s;e may &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We will not be the tools and in&s;truments of corrupt, revenge|ful, or factious men, of any party or de&s;cription. Above &pound;60,000 has, by this time, been expended in a di&s;graceful per&s;ecution of an indivual. We voted to <HI>continue</HI> the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings, not from any knowledge <HI>we</HI> had of the charges preferred again&s;t him, for <HI>we</HI> never looked into a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> allegation; but, becau&s;e <HI>we</HI> thought a di&s;&s;olution did not of nece&s;&s;ity abate an impeachment; and, becau&s;e we had &s;o much confidence in <HI>the &s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice of the la&s;t Hou&s;e,</HI> as to believe that they did not place an implicit
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
credit in the a&s;&s;ertions of any man; but that they had <HI>&s;ober and rational grounds</HI> for be|lieving that Mr. Burke <HI>&s;poke truth,</HI> when he told them, that Sir John Shore was <HI>a creature of Mr. Ha&s;tings</HI>; that, kingdoms which Mr. Ha&s;tings found flouri&s;hing, he left <HI>de&s;olate</HI>; that a <HI>whole people happy</HI> at his acce&s;&s;ion, he made mi&s;erable for thirteen years; and that the <HI>public re|venues</HI> which were <HI>productive</HI> on his ar|rival, declined <HI>rapidly</HI> under his admin&s;|tration. But, to our <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> the King's Mini&s;ters have promoted to the high office of Governor of Bengal, the very man whom Mr. Burke has <HI>called the creature of Mr. Ha&s;tings</HI>; and whom Mr. Burke &s;o &s;trongly cen&s;ured in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall. We find that this gentleman, &s;o &s;elected, has &s;olemnly depo&s;ed before the Peers, that Bengal had greatly <HI>improved</HI> in <HI>population</HI> and <HI>agriculture</HI> during the go|vernment of Mr. Ha&s;tings; that under
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
him <HI>property</HI> was better protected, and the natives happier, than under their own So|vereigns, and that of Mr. Ha&s;tings the Natives <HI>had a very favourable opinion.</HI> Have the King's Mini&s;ters &s;elected a man for &s;o high an office, who is capable of laying <HI>perjury on his &s;oul to &s;erve Mr. Ha&s;tings?</HI> and if not, if Sir John Shore is to be <HI>believed upon his oath,</HI> we di&s;grace our|&s;elves, and our Con&s;tituents, by &s;uffering &s;uch execrable fal&s;ehoods to continue to &s;tain the journals of the la&s;t Parliament. Nor is this all: the King's India Mini&s;ter has annually pre&s;ented accounts of the &s;tate of Bengal to this Hou&s;e. We have our&s;elves &s;een by tho&s;e accounts the pro|gre&s;&s;ive improvement of the revenues of Bengal during his government, and &s;ince his departure; and they <HI>prove,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the accounts to be <HI>correct,</HI> that Sir John Shore has &s;worn the truth. Whatever motives the King's India Mini&s;ters may
<PB N="x" REF="11">
have for acting &s;o <HI>incon&s;i&s;tently,</HI> we ought to be actuated by a love of ju&s;tice alone. As Repre&s;entatives of the peo|ple, it would be di&s;graceful to us, to vote away their money annually, and to oppre&s;s, in a manner unexampled in any age or nation, a meritorious individual, becau&s;e infamy mu&s;t re&s;t &s;omewhere, if any part of this pro&s;ecution has been wantonly, maliciou&s;ly, or carele&s;&s;ly un|dertaken. But the infamy will fall upon our heads, if after &s;uch clear and deci&s;ive proofs, that Bengal was <HI>not</HI> in the &s;ituation de&s;cribed by Mr. Burke, we &s;till permit him to &s;ay, in the name of the Commons of Great Britain, that the country has been de&s;olated, its inhabitants plundered and de&s;troyed, and its revenues dimini&s;hed by Mr. Ha&s;tings."</Q></P>
<P>We think it much more natural for the Hou&s;e to declare the&s;e manly &s;entiments, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="xi" REF="12">
they are the &s;entiments <HI>univer&s;ally prevalent among&s;t their con&s;tituents,</HI> than to find them ready to &s;econd Mr. Burke's attack of Sir John Shore, or to vote alter|nately with Mr. Dundas, that white is black, and black is white.</P>
<P>But can Mr. Burke in this in&s;tance depend upon Mr. Pitt? and was it an article in that curious treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We &s;tate this fact of the treaty, on the authority of a pamphlet which is in every body's hands. We have no doubt of the truth of it, becau&s;e Mr. Burke declared in the Hou&s;e, that Mr. Pitt <HI>had neutralized</HI> and <HI>dulcified</HI> him by his conduct <HI>on the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings.</HI></NOTE>, which &s;o completely <HI>neutra|lized</HI> and <HI>dulcified</HI> Mr. Burke, that for two years he has cea&s;ed to abu&s;e Mr. Pitt in the gro&s;s terms which he formerly applied to him: was it, we a&s;k, an article of the treaty, that the national pur&s;e, the national honour, the honour of the King, and even of Mr. Pitt him&s;elf, &s;hould be ceded <HI>for ever</HI> to Mr. Burke? Though Mr. Pitt may have li&s;ten|ed
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
with calm tranquillity, or with &s;ecret &s;ati&s;|faction to Mr. Burke, while he &s;pent his rage upon his old connections, or upon Mr. Ha&s;tings, yet he will hardly be plea&s;ed with &s;o very direct an attack upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was a duty <HI>impo&s;ed by the law</HI> upon Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas, to examine with the clo&s;e&s;t attention every tran&s;action of Sir John Shore's public life, before they <HI>acquie&s;ced</HI> in his appointment. We are <HI>confident</HI> that in this in&s;tance they performed their duty; and we believe that <HI>they,</HI> and not the Direc|tors, were induced to <HI>&s;olicit</HI> Sir John Shore to accept the office, becau&s;e he appeared to them to have acted with the &s;tricte&s;t in|tegrity and honour, and for the national intere&s;ts, in all tho&s;e tran&s;actions, which, Mr. Burke pre&s;umes to &s;ay, appeared, on the fir&s;t view, <HI>very reprehen&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>We are indeed well aware that Mr. Burke has brought Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas into
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
an unfortunate dilemma. Sir John Shore's appointment <HI>does throw &s;ome little di&s;grace</HI> upon <HI>that impeachment</HI> for which tho&s;e Mi|ni&s;ters <HI>voted</HI>; but, in ju&s;tice to all parties, we will &s;tate <HI>how far they were concerned.</HI></P>
<P>The whole of that immen&s;e ma&s;s of mat|ter, which was called "Revenues," was opened by Mr. Francis, in a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, on the 19th of April 1787. The charge, in &s;ub&s;tance, was, that between 1772, and 1785, Mr. Ha&s;tings had violated private property, had oppre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t griev|ou&s;ly per&s;ons of all ages, ranks, and de|&s;criptions, had annihilated the nobility and country gentlemen of a great empire, and had materially injured the public revenues, by his various and oppre&s;&s;ive modes of col|lecting them.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt mo&s;t eloquently and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed every allegation in the charge. He
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
declared that Mr. Francis's de&s;cription of Bengal was utterly <HI>unfounded,</HI> that country being in a mo&s;t <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> and <HI>pro&s;perous &s;tate,</HI> and that his &s;tatement of a <HI>declining revenue</HI> was <HI>di&s;proved, by the evidence of figures.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Fox, with much vehemence, &s;upported Mr. Francis, and expre&s;&s;ed his concern that Mr. Pitt, <HI>who had lately been in the habit of agreeing with them,</HI> &s;hould differ upon this, <HI>the mo&s;t important of all their charges</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Fox undoubtedly was right, that this was the <HI>mo&s;t important of all the articles.</HI> It was &s;o &s;tated by Mr. Burke originally, who declared, that if Mr. Ha&s;tings <HI>had</HI> improved the face of a country, had made a numerous people happy, had extended commerce, and encrea&s;ed population, and the Public income; <HI>he</HI> never would have conceived the idea of entering into a <HI>minute &s;crutiny</HI> of the conduct of &s;uch a man. If this were not mere <HI>verbiage,</HI> what can Mr. Burke &s;ay, after having heard the evidence of Sir John Shore?</NOTE>. He was &s;upported warmly by Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>Upon the divi&s;ion, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Gren|ville, Mr. Dundas, and Lord Mulgrave, the
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
four India Mini&s;ters, with their Secretary, Mr. Rou&s;e, the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and the Law Officers of the Crown, were in a minority. Fifty-five voted with Mr. Pitt, &s;eventy-one with Mr. Francis, who con&s;equently carried his que&s;tion by a ma|jority of fifteen.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who do not know what was the <HI>routine</HI> of bu&s;ine&s;s, in the <HI>la&s;t Parliament,</HI> it may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain <HI>how</HI> &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance occurred.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom of the Trea&s;ury to &s;end notes to their friends, to reque&s;t attendance, when the Mini&s;ter was anxious to &s;ucceed in a que&s;tion, and the Oppo&s;ition had &s;ome active partizan who took the &s;ame means <HI>to collect their forces.</HI> Mr. Francis being a man of &s;ome con&s;equence, on their &s;ide, the party were &s;ummoned, <HI>and they came in a body to his &s;upport.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="17">Whether Mr. Pitt from delicacy did not i&s;&s;ue his Trea&s;ury notes, as it was a judicial que&s;tion, or whether he was determined that his influence &s;hould never be exerci&s;ed <HI>for Mr. Ha&s;tings,</HI> though he took ample pains, on many occa&s;ions, to exerci&s;e it <HI>again&s;t him,</HI> the fact is, that from a thin attendance of Mr. Pitt's friends, he was left in a mi|nority.</P>
<P>But there were <HI>other &s;tages</HI> in the cour&s;e of this article when Mr. Pitt might have thrown it out, had he plea&s;ed; for it was not pre|&s;ented to the Hou&s;e in its <HI>pre&s;ent form,</HI> until the 10th of May, and the Tue&s;day fol|lowing was appointed for taking it into con|&s;ideration. At this time, Mr. Dundas had opened his fir&s;t India Budget, and, to a man of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> it was perfectly clear, that unle&s;s Mr. Dundas <HI>impo&s;ed fal&s;e accounts upon the Hou&s;e,</HI> the Revenue Article was a gro&s;s libel on the Government of Bengal.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18">A Member, who believed Mr. Dundas told truth, and that the article was filled with fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, took the liberty to &s;peak to Mr. Pitt on the 10th of May, upon this &s;ubject, and al&s;o to Mr. Rou&s;e. He remind|ed Mr. Pitt, that he had voted again&s;t the Revenue article <HI>in toto.</HI> He pointed out how glaringly it fal&s;ified all Mr. Dundas's a&s;&s;er|tions, and all his accounts, and he a&s;ked Mr. Pitt if he did not intend to oppo&s;e it on the Tue&s;day, and to endeavour to throw it out altogether. Mr. Pitt told that Member, in reply, that he &s;hould give no further op|po&s;ition to the article, but he did not con|de&s;cend to explain <HI>his rea&s;ons</HI> for being &s;ilent; &s;o that, <HI>in point of fact,</HI> Mr. Pitt <HI>actually voted</HI> in direct contradiction to &s;entiments forcibly and eloquently delivered by him|&s;elf: any oppo&s;ition by an unconnected Member to an article which Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox &s;upported would have been idle in the extreme.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="19">But if Mr. Pitt had given <HI>notice,</HI> that he would oppo&s;e the revenue article on <HI>its third reading,</HI> and if then he had pointed out how materially it cut up all that Mr. Dundas had &s;aid, we are confident that the article would have been totally rejected. We re|member to have &s;een Mr. Pitt a little ruffled on being left in a minority, on a que&s;tion relative to the African Carrying Trade; he told the Hou&s;e that he would oppo&s;e the clau&s;e which had been carried again&s;t him, <HI>on the Report</HI>; and <HI>then,</HI> an irre&s;i&s;tible phalanx crowded down, which in&s;ured his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As the matter now &s;tands, we allow that the la&s;t Parliament agreed with Mr. Francis, that Bengal was <HI>irretrievably ruined,</HI> and with Mr. Dundas, <HI>that it was the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing country in India.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>this Hou&s;e</HI> is not at all re&s;pon&s;ible for the <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> or the <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> of the la&s;t;
<PB N="xix" REF="20">
what has this Hou&s;e ever heard about Bengal, except from Mr. Dundas? and <HI>his communications</HI> have been mo&s;t flattering, indeed, to Mr. Ha&s;tings; and to Sir John Shore, who acted under him.</P>
<P>Of the revenue article voted by the la&s;t Parliament, this Hou&s;e <HI>knows nothing,</HI> for the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible rea&s;ons; becau&s;e it would not conde&s;cend <HI>to inquire.</HI></P>
<P>This Hou&s;e voted two Re&s;olutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t on the 19th of December 1790, the &s;econd on the 14th of February 1791.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t, that the Impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings was <HI>depending</HI>; or, in other words, that an impeachment exi&s;ting at a di&s;&s;olution, was not <HI>abated</HI> by that di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Re&s;olution was, that this Hou&s;e would proceed no further in the Impeachment beyond tho&s;e articles <HI>on which the Managers had already clo&s;ed their evi|dence,</HI> excepting <HI>only</HI> to <HI>Contracts, Pen&s;ions,</HI>
<PB N="xx" REF="21">
and <HI>Allowances</HI>; and tho&s;e were fini&s;hed in &s;ix days, in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</P>
<P>Beyond this, the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e has not gone. The articles voted by the la&s;t Hou&s;e may have been very well, or very ill found|ed; very true, or very fal&s;e.&mdash;They might have been con&s;idered with great care and attention, or by far the greater number may not to this moment have been read by the Members who voted for them&mdash;This Hou&s;e neither knew, nor cared, about them&mdash;They <HI>lent the authority of their name</HI> to <HI>all</HI> that the Managers <HI>had done in the la&s;t Parliament,</HI> of which they could know <HI>nothing,</HI> and they <HI>tied up Mr. Burke</HI> from <HI>proceeding beyond cer|tain &s;pecified points in future.</HI></P>
<P>We conclude it was an article of the treaty with Mr. Pitt, which the latter in|&s;i&s;ted upon, that Mr. Burke &s;hould not go on <HI>eternally,</HI> becau&s;e he <HI>lamented</HI> in the Hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The 14th of February 1791.</NOTE>,
<PB N="xxi" REF="22">
that he was <HI>compelled</HI> to yield to the crimi|nal impatience of the times, and to give up all the remaining articles, the Contracts ex|cepted.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, therefore, cannot &s;tir one &s;tep without the <HI>authority of the Hou&s;e</HI>&mdash;No con|&s;equences ho&s;tile to the Directors, or to the King's Mini&s;ters, can follow from Sir John Shore's appointment; unle&s;s he can per&s;uade the Hou&s;e to <HI>re&s;cind</HI> their la&s;t re&s;olution. The Hou&s;e may undoubtedly prefer <HI>new articles,</HI> even while Mr. Ha&s;tings is upon his defence&mdash;The Hou&s;e <HI>may</HI> prolong the trial as long as it lives, and its &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may al&s;o continue it until a hundred more of the Judges make a journey to the other world&mdash;There is nothing <HI>&s;ub&s;tantially unju&s;t,</HI> that the Hou&s;e may not do according to the &s;trict forms of Parliamentary Impeach|ments; but Mr. Burke has no right to pre|&s;ume that the Hou&s;e <HI>will</HI> &s;uffer him to move an inch beyond <HI>a Reply,</HI> upon the matter
<PB N="xxii" REF="23">
<HI>now at i&s;&s;ue.</HI> If there is common &s;en&s;e in his letter, he mu&s;t move to impeach Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas, for reducing to <HI>con|tempt</HI> the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings, by nominating to the office of Governor General, a man who has been <HI>a principal actor and party</HI> in the mal-admini&s;tration of the revenues; but we confidently affirm, that he has not a <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of foundation, on which to re&s;t a charge again&s;t the King's Mini&s;ters, or the Court of Directors. The King's Mini&s;ters never would allow that the revenues had been ill admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke writes to the Chairman,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Managers for the Commons have opened <HI>facts of a very &s;trong nature,</HI> which go <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> to affect Mr. Shore's admi|ni&s;tration, and they <HI>offered</HI> evidence upon them to the Lords."</Q></P>
<P>It is true, that <HI>Mr. Burke</HI> did open &s;uch facts, as he calls them; but, in the fir&s;t
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24">
place, he acted without authority in opening them&mdash;and &s;econdly, the facts, or by far the greater number of them, <HI>were not true</HI>&mdash;and thirdly, Sir John Shore cannot be re&s;pon&s;i|ble for &s;uch facts as were true, in any po&s;&s;ible point of view. He certainly <HI>did</HI> reflect very <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> upon the character and conduct of Sir John Shore; but in &s;o doing <HI>he exceeded his powers,</HI> and it was neither more nor le&s;s, than the groundle&s;s calumny of an unauthorized individual.</P>
<P>To prevent, therefore, <HI>all further mi&s;re|pre&s;entations,</HI> we now publi&s;h <HI>tho&s;e facts of a very &s;trong nature,</HI> which Mr. Burke <HI>opened,</HI> and we print them from minutes taken at the time by a &s;hort-hand writer. There may &s;till be &s;ome errors, owing to the rapidity of Mr. Burke's utterance, but they cannot materially affect his argument: tho&s;e who have read Mr. Dod&s;ley's ab&s;tract in his Regi&s;ter, will find how clearly both accounts agree in all e&s;&s;ential points.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="25">If Mr. Burke's doctrine were to prevail, what would be Mr. Pitt's &s;ituation!! A Manager, on an India Impeachment, has but to &s;elect all the meritorious &s;ervants of the public, and if he can, like Mr. Burke, call names with the fluency of a Marat, or a Pari&s;ian Poi&s;&s;arde, he may apply the epithet <HI>Creature</HI> to one man, <HI>Secret Agent</HI> to a &s;econd, <HI>Bribe Broker</HI> to a third, <HI>Murderer</HI> to a fourth, <HI>Corrupt In&s;trument</HI> to a fifth, <HI>Captain General of Iniquity</HI> to a &s;ixth, <HI>Villain</HI> to a &s;eventh, and &s;o on, until he forces Mr. Pitt to have recour&s;e to the Ranks of Oppo&s;ition for a Governor General.</P>
<P>Many years ago Mr. Burke played the &s;ame game, though he then acted by authority.&mdash;As &s;oon as the Rockingham Admini&s;tration were in power, he drew out a Parliamentary Report<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1782.</NOTE>, in which he mo&s;t violently attacked the Directors for appointing Sir John Mac|pher&s;on, and Mr. Stables, to the Supreme
<PB N="xxv" REF="26">
Council, and the Hon. Mr. Stuart, and Mr. Sulivan, to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, upon vacancies.</P>
<P>He imputed to Sir John Macpher&s;on, a de&s;ign to &s;upport the Nabob of Arcot, by bribing the King's Mini&s;ters, and Parlia|ment it&s;elf. Mr. Stables was an improper per&s;on, becau&s;e he had not been in the Civil Service; Mr. Stuart was an accu&s;ed man; and Mr. Sulivan was the &s;on of the Chairman.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke, however, has once more thought proper to allude
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to the offences opened by the Managers,"</Q> that is, <HI>by him|&s;elf,</HI> the &s;tory &s;hall be told in intelligible language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Managers knew nothing of this &s;tory until Mr. Burke told it in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, and he him&s;elf only got the hint of it, from Mr. Francis, two days be|fore the trial commenced.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The day after he had concluded his ac|count <HI>of tho&s;e offences,</HI> the late Lord Chan|cellor
<PB N="xxvi" REF="27">
(for the trial, after &s;urviving almo&s;t a hundred of its Judges, has now outlived the Pre&s;ident of the Court) &s;tated in the Hou&s;e of Lords,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the new matter introduced by Mr. Burke in his opening &s;peech, was of &s;uch a nature that, compared with it, the articles, important as they were, <HI>&s;unk to utter in&s;ignificance</HI>; and that Mr. Burke would be a <HI>calumniator,</HI> if he did not put it into &s;uch a form as might enable Mr. Ha&s;tings to refute it; if he could not re|fute it, then no puni&s;hment in the power of their Lord&s;hips to inflict, could be adequate to his offences."</Q></P>
<P>The Duke of Richmond took the &s;ame line; and added the epithet "ba&s;e," to that of calumniator.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e &s;peeches Mr. Burke took no notice. In the next year, 1789, Mr. Burke, in one of his rants, called Mr. Ha&s;tings "a Murderer;" Mr. Ha&s;tings complained
<PB N="xxvii" REF="28">
to the Hou&s;e of Commons next day of this &s;candalous outrage; he complained al&s;o, of the introduction of the &s;tory of Deby Sing in the preceding year, and he prayed the Hou&s;e to frame both accu&s;ations into articles, if <HI>they</HI> thought there were grounds to do &s;o; if not, to redre&s;s the injury which he had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e cen&s;ured Mr. Burke for the fir&s;t offence again&s;t decency and ju&s;tice; but they rejected the &s;econd complaint, not becau&s;e it was <HI>unfounded,</HI> but becau&s;e Mr. Ha&s;tings had not complained of the injury, as &s;oon as he received it.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke affirmed, <HI>upon this occa&s;ion,</HI> that he was <HI>determined</HI> to go into this &s;tory of Deby Sing.&mdash;The year pa&s;&s;ed over, <HI>and he did nothing.</HI></P>
<P>In the next year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 18th of May.</NOTE>, 1790, <HI>evidence</HI> was offered upon it, as he tells the Chairman; but, however, in &s;uch a manner, we will venture
<PB N="xxviii" REF="29">
to &s;ay, as no <HI>lawyer</HI> could have advi&s;ed; for in&s;tead of going to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and there &s;tating <HI>the grounds</HI> for implicating Mr. Ha&s;tings in any tran&s;actions of Deby Sing, as a foundation for an additional ar|ticle; either Mr. Burke, or Mr. An&s;truther, called for an opinion delivered by Mr. Ha&s;tings in January 1785, in which he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he &s;o well knows the character and abilities of Rajah Deby Sing, as ea&s;ily to conceive it was in his power to commit the enormities laid to his charge, and to conceal the ground of them from the Engli&s;h Re&s;ident, Mr. Goodlad."</Q></P>
<P>Upon this opinion, the Managers &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they would next proceed to &s;hew what tho&s;e enormities were, which might be concealed from the Engli&s;h gentlemen re&s;iding there, and which might be committed without their knowing any thing of the matter."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="30">This mi&s;erable attempt was in&s;tantly op|po&s;ed by the Coun&s;el of Mr. Ha&s;tings, who at the &s;ame time pre&s;&s;ed Mr. Burke to go to the Commons, and if he could per&s;uade <HI>them</HI> to accu&s;e Mr. Ha&s;tings, they would mo&s;t eagerly, and gladly meet the accu&s;a|tion; but they would neither allow Mr. Burke to make charges of <HI>his own authority,</HI> nor permit him to adduce evidence upon charges &s;o made.</P>
<P>The opinion of the Lords was called for, and they <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> determined,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is <HI>not</HI> competent for the Managers for the Commons to give evidence of the enor|mities actually committed by Deby Sing, <HI>the &s;ame not being charged in the Impeach|ment</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Printed evidence, page 1251,</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>A rational man would have &s;uppo&s;ed, that after &s;uch a deci&s;ion, Mr. Burke would have done one of two things&mdash;either that which his
<PB N="xxx" REF="31">
<HI>character</HI> and his <HI>honour</HI> required: namely, to bring the &s;ubject <HI>fully before the la&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> or to have been &s;ilent for ever. He did not adopt the fir&s;t and be&s;t mea&s;ure; nay, as it re&s;pects <HI>Mr. Ha&s;tings,</HI> he has totally dropped it; but as &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty had honoured Sir John Shore by his favour, and when the King's Mini&s;ters had &s;elected him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for an office of the highe&s;t tru&s;t, and the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible power,"</Q> then Mr. Burke revived this &s;tory of Deby Sing, in his letter to the Chairman, in order to make an im|pre&s;&s;ion <HI>again&s;t Sir John Shore.</HI>
To re&s;cue <HI>his character,</HI> therefore, from the calumnies of Mr. Burke&mdash;to re&s;cue the character of the Briti&s;h nation in India, from the reproach which Mr. Burke has &s;o unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon it; we have printed his &s;peech, and we have added explanatory notes, in order to prove that no one Engli&s;h gentleman can be re|&s;pon&s;ible for the conduct of Deby Sing.</P>
<P>It has been rumoured in the vicinity of St. James's, that Mr. Burke has complained
<PB N="xxxi" REF="32">
of Sir John Shore's appointment to Mr. Dundas in very &s;trong terms. To this worthy gentleman, his complaints are not impro|perly addre&s;&s;ed. In return for Mr. Burke's important &s;ervices to Mini&s;ters, he might have expected a continuance of that cordial &s;upport which Mr. Dundas has hitherto given him, in carrying on the impeachment.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke may have addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Dun|das with great propriety, in the following terms: To &s;upport you in office, I have given up character, principle, and con&s;i&s;tency. No very long period has elap&s;ed &s;ince I affirmed, in the face of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and of my country,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That all the acts and monuments in the records of pecula|tion, the con&s;olidated corruption of ages, the patterns of exemplary plunder in the heroic times of Roman iniquity, never equalled the gigantic corruption of a &s;ingle act,"</Q> conceived and executed by you and

Mr. Pitt.
I &s;olemnly pledged my&s;elf to be
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a &s;teady, earne&s;t, and faithful a&s;&s;i&s;tant to any one who &s;hould bring forward any plan that might tend to a &s;ubver&s;ion of that mo&s;t <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;y&s;tem for the government of India<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;ages marked by inverted commas, are taken from the &s;peeches printed by Mr. Burke him&s;elf.</NOTE>,"</Q> which you and Mr. Pitt have e&s;tabli&s;hed under the &s;anc|tion of Parliament; but &s;o completely was I<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "<HI>neutralized</HI> and <HI>dulcified</HI>"</Q> by your &s;upport of the impeachment, that I have now <HI>forgot</HI> all my former &s;peeches, though I printed them publicly, and though Mr. Dod&s;ley has very lately &s;ent a fre&s;h edition of them into the world.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem which I cen&s;ured &s;o loudly, is &s;till continued in all its parts; but I have <HI>long &s;ince</HI> cea&s;ed to &s;ound the trumpet of alarm; and you may violate Treaties, you may di&s;grace the honour of Great

I have lo&s;t no opportunity of expo&s;ing the weakne&s;s of that party, to who&s;e intere&s;ts my be&s;t days were devoted. I have u&s;ed every means in my power to &s;catter them to atoms.

<P>In return for the&s;e important &s;ervices, you have di&s;graced me in the opinion of
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="35">
every man of honour in the nation. You ought to have remembered the high tone which I affected, when I originally moved the Impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings. I did not venture at once to accu&s;e him of &s;pending half a million improvidently, in thirteen years, while he added millions to the public re&s;ources&mdash;with all the ex|travagance of the American war before their eyes; with the pen&s;ions, &s;inecure places, and Peerages, &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed by Mini&s;ters of late years, open to their view; the Country Gentlemen would have &s;couted every idea of a criminal pro&s;ecu|tion upon &s;o contemptible charge; I, there|fore, played a deeper, and a more artful part&mdash;I began by telling them, that pro|vinces, once mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, Mr. Ha&s;tings had de&s;olated&mdash;that countries, once emi|nently peopled, were now inhabited only by bea&s;ts of prey&mdash;that in&s;titutions, &s;acred in the opinions of nations, he had pub|licly
<PB N="xxxv" REF="36">
violated&mdash;that commerce he had de&s;troyed, and that the revenues by his mi&s;management had greatly declined. The Country Gentlemen believed me, and they voted with me. My work from this time was ea&s;y, in the Hou&s;e; but out of doors, your annual budget, in which you &s;o pointedly contradicted all my &s;tate|ments, hurt my reputation con&s;iderably; and as if that were not enough, you have now taken a &s;tep which has <HI>ruined me,</HI> and will materially injure <HI>you.</HI> Had you <HI>no recollection</HI> of the evidence which <HI>the new Baronet</HI> gave in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall? The man, whom <HI>you</HI> have made Governor General, has &s;worn, that from 1770 to 1789, including every year of Mr. Ha&s;ting's admini&s;tration, Bengal had pro|gre&s;&s;ively <HI>improved</HI> in agriculture and <HI>popu|lation,</HI> that the natives were <HI>happier,</HI> and their property <HI>better protected, in that period,</HI> than under their own &s;overeigns, and that
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="37">
<HI>of Mr. Ha&s;tings</HI> they entertained <HI>a very favourable opinion.</HI> How can I affirm here|after, that Mr. Ha&s;tings was a tyrant, an oppre&s;&s;or, a murderer, a captain-general of iniquity, or that India, on his departure from it, felt relieved from a weight under which &s;he had long groaned? It will be &s;aid to me, if the &s;olemn te&s;timony of a man, whom <HI>your gracious &s;overeign de|lighteth to honour,</HI> and whom his confiden|tial &s;ervants have appointed Governor General of India, is to be believed, you, Mr. Burke, have been impo&s;ing upon, and deceiving us. What an&s;wer can I make? unle&s;s I am ready to pronounce that next to that act which I &s;o violently cen&s;ured a few years ago, this appointment of Sir John Shore is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the mo&s;t gigantic in&s;tance of corruption"</Q> ever committed in the world!</P>
<P>But though you and Mr. Pitt had no
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="38">
con&s;ideration <HI>for me,</HI> you might have been alarmed <HI>for your&s;elves.</HI> Though it be true, that you differed mo&s;t widely from me as to the &s;tate of Bengal, and when I declared it to be ruined irretrievably, you pronounced it to be mo&s;t <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> and <HI>pro&s;perous,</HI> yet it is equally true, that you <HI>ultimately voted</HI> with me, and you have paid the Solicitors bill, for very heavy charges incurred by my orders, in an attempt to prove <HI>legally</HI> what <HI>you</HI> have publickly declared to be utterly <HI>un|founded in truth.</HI></P>
<P>You ought to have recollected, that &s;ince this mo&s;t unhappy bu&s;ine&s;s in France, the people of England have had the in&s;olence to think, and to &s;peak what they think, with much more freedom than formerly. There is no longer a blind reverence paid to great names, or to great authorities&mdash;Remember my words in Parliament, prophetic they were, and the prediction is almo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed.
<PB N="xxviii" REF="39">
I &s;aid, that in this impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings,

It will not be from me alone, that the public will a&s;k, how it hap|pens that &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds of their money has been expended? that the fir&s;t principle of Magna Charta has been violated by the exten&s;ion of a criminal trial to a period unknown <HI>in former times,</HI> and which no man could have &s;u&s;pected would have happened <HI>at any time?</HI> They will &s;ay, that you have proved your di&s;belief of the <HI>foun|dation</HI> of this impeachment, by preferring a man who has de&s;troyed <HI>that foundation</HI> by his evidence; or they will take up the ar|gument in my letter to the Chairman, and totally condemn the appointment, &s;o that in either ca&s;e, <HI>you</HI> cannot e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of the public&mdash;and was this a time to turn po|litics into farce?

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's &s;peech on the Reform, February 1780.</NOTE> were na|turally lovers of low company."</Q>
The time was when I cen&s;ured the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, for its uncon&s;titutional addre&s;s to the Throne<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In May 1776, on the American war.</NOTE>.

his indi&s;po&s;ition, but I am now the avowed champion of monarchy, of the church, and of ari&s;tocracy throughout the world. In|deed, my dear friend, you have acted incon|&s;iderately to give no har&s;her term to your conduct. This was not a time to expo&s;e me, or to ri&s;que your own &s;ituation. What conclu&s;ion can &s;ober and thinking men come to?

<HEAD>Mr. BURKE's SPEECH, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>DINAGEPORE, my Lords, is a country-pretty nearly as large as all York&s;hire together, and has a prince at the head called the Rajah, or Zemindar, of Dinagepore. I find that about July<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died in April 1780, and his adopted &s;on was on the 20th of June 1780, ordered to &s;ucceed to the zemindary, by an unanimous vote of the board, Me&s;&s;rs. Ha&s;tings, Francis, and Wheler.</NOTE> 1780, the Rajah died, leaving a half brother and a &s;on. A litiga|tion in&s;tantly aro&s;e in the family; and this litigation was intirely to be referred, and it mu&s;t finally be decided by the Governor Ge|neral and Council, being the ultimate autho|rity
<PB N="2" REF="45">
for all the revenue que&s;tions there, and they were to proceed on the opinion of the regi&s;ter in their deci&s;ion. It came before Mr. Ha&s;tings, and I find he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, the whole Board.</NOTE> decided the que&s;tion in favour of Sudernand Sing, &s;on of the Rajah, again&s;t his half brother. I find on that deci&s;ion a rent &s;ettled, and a fine paid, &s;o that all this tran&s;action is fair and above board, and I find along with it many extraordinary acts, for I find that Mr. Ha&s;t|ings took a part in favour of the mini&s;ter Hyderbeg, agreeable to the principles of others, and contrary to his own; and on his e&s;tabli&s;hing the authority of the mini&s;ter Hyderbeg, I find he gave the guardian&s;hip of this &s;on to the brother of the Rajah, as he is called, the brother of the wife of the late Rajah decea&s;ed; and when the &s;teward of the province was coming down to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to Mr. Ha&s;tings, Mr. Ha&s;tings<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The whole Board.</NOTE> not only &s;ent him back, &s;o far from hearing him fully, but he ordered him actually to be turned out of his office, to bring in another that could only increa&s;e the family di&s;&s;en&s;ion.
<PB N="3" REF="46">
I find he has taken a &s;um of &pound;40,000 in 1780, for this account &s;eems to begin in July 1780, or &s;omewhere thereabouts; and to the &s;ame period in 1781 there was a regu|lar payment; &s;o that if it refers to the money paid to him from the Rajah, it is a &s;um of money corruptly taken by him. As judge he receives it for judgment: but whether the judgment be right or wrong, true or fal&s;e, he corruptly receives the &s;um of &pound;40,000 for that judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion could not be true, becau&s;e this money began to be received on the 11th of Augu&s;t 1779, eight months before the death of the old Rajah, and, as appears by the managers' evidence, was principally paid in the year 1779.</NOTE>; he received it, you will ob&s;erve, through Gunga Govind Sing, who was the broker of agreements: he was the per&s;on that was to receive it by monthly in&s;talments, and to pay it to Mr. Ha&s;tings. Gunga Govind Sing's &s;on had in his hand all the papers and documents, &s;o that Mr. Ha&s;t|ings takes a bribe from an infant of five or &s;ix years old, through the hands of the re|gi&s;ter, who&s;e opinion was to have the whole weight in &s;ettling the judgment. This was not a public tribute or fine; &s;o that in fact,
<PB N="4" REF="47">
through the regi&s;ter of the country, the keeper of the records, he receives a bribe from a family in point of judgment in di&s;|inheriting the brother.

<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate to you who was this Deby Sing, to whom the&s;e great tru&s;ts were appointed and profits given. Deby Sing was a per&s;on of the tribe of Banyans, that is to &s;ay, the trading and merchant cla&s;s of India; and he was practi&s;ed in all tho&s;e little arts and frauds to get money, and was &s;ucce&s;sful: He was employed by Mahomed Reza Cawn, while that great man had the management of all the affairs of &s;tate and revenue in his hands under the Company. Deby Sing paid his court to him with all the a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ubtilne&s;s which tho&s;e who have no princi|ple are very apt to u&s;e. When M. R. Cawn was brought down by Mr. Ha&s;tings and ordered on a &s;trange charge to Calcutta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a &s;ingular fact, that as often as people in power in England have had a wi&s;h to carry a point again&s;t the Ea&s;t India Company, they have had recour&s;e to the foule&s;t calumnies. Mr. Burke here does ju&s;tice to Ma|homed Reza Cawn; but in 1773, when Lord North and his friends made Mr. Ha&s;tings <HI>the &s;ingle exception</HI> to the univer&s;al abu&s;e be&s;towed upon the &s;ervants of the Com|pany, Colonel Dow wrote a book, in which there is the following pa&s;&s;age reflecting upon Mahomed Reza Cawn:

The tenants being at length ruined, the farmers were unable to make good their contract with go|vernment. Their cruelties to tho&s;e in pri&s;on re|coiled at length on them&s;elves. Many of them were bound to &s;takes, and whipped: but their poverty cea&s;ed to be feigned. Their complaints were heard in every &s;quare of Moor&s;hedabad, <HI>and not a few of them expired in agonies under the la&s;h.</HI>"</Q>
In 1783, at the di&s;tance of ten years, when <HI>another attack</HI> was made upon the Company, a &s;imilar unju&s;tifiable calumny was repeated by Mr. Burke.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"I cannot con|clude without an additional remark, that there never was a cau&s;e which appears to have been more thoroughly inve&s;tigated, or more impartially conduct|ed. Every member of the exi&s;ting government at the time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Me&s;&s;irs, Ha&s;tings, Wheler, Macpher&s;on, and Stables.</NOTE>, it is notorious, had formed a deci&s;ive opinion again&s;t Deby Sing, in con&s;equence of Mr. Pater&s;on's reports; and the mea&s;ures adopted were conformable to tho&s;e &s;entiments, and calculated to &s;hew that, if proved guilty, he had no mercy to expect. It was under this decided and avowed di&s;approbation of Government, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners reluctantly undertook an in|ve&s;tigation of this cau&s;e. Their proceedings, in my opinion, do equal credit to their integrity and to their under&s;tandings. Facts are not left to bare a&s;&s;ertion for &s;upport. Every charge (and &s;ome not &s;pecifically pointed out to the Commi&s;&s;ioners) is examined with &s;crupulous accuracy; and wherever evidence could be obtained, it has been &s;ought for, and brought forward. The proceedings are not &s;ummary, but voluminous and minute; and if the conduct of any Zemindar or farmer in the country were to pa&s;s an inve&s;tigation of the &s;ame nature, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that he would not be deemed innocent."</P>
<P>"The tran&s;actions in Dhee Jumla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where the atrocious cruelties &s;tated by Mr. Burke were &s;aid to have been committed.</NOTE>, being wholly un|connected with the proceedings in Rungpore, I have followed the example of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, in con&s;i|dering them &s;eparately.

<P>Though Sir John Shore acquits Deby Sing of having had any &s;hare in &s;uch acts of cruelty as were really committed in Dhee Jumla, while he &s;tates al&s;o that many of the wor&s;t accu&s;ations were utterly unfounded, yet the conduct of Deby Sing in <HI>Rungpore</HI> did not e&s;cape his cen&s;ure; at the &s;ame time he thought it but ju&s;tice to remark, that the actual guilt of Deby Sing bore no &s;ort of proportion to the magnitude of the charges pre|ferred again&s;t him.</P></NOTE>. To &s;ay no more, he was a patient witne&s;s of the rebellion. He immediately &s;ent

for Briti&s;h officers, who ordered military ex|ecution; and you may ea&s;ily believe how

&s;oon regular troops got the better of unarmed de&s;pair. They were conquered, vanqui&s;hed, and &s;laughtered; and Mr. Goodlad ordered, that of the&s;e mi&s;erable people, two or three &s;hould undergo the proce&s;s of the law, and be publicly hanged up; and hanged up they were.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, though the rebellion &s;eemed to be cru&s;hed, the country was in that &s;ituation that Mr. Goodlad was
<PB N="35" REF="78">
obliged to write down to Calcutta, that there never had been &s;o material and &s;erious a rebellion in Bengal. This was in 1782, and it made a very great noi&s;e in Calcutta. But there is &s;uch a gulph between us and Calcutta, that I venture to &s;ay, not one of all the great and noble auditors pre&s;ent ever heard of it. On the contrary, it is a con&s;tant rule that, whenever any thing is quiet in Bengal, you are &s;ure to hear of it. Here, the in&s;ide of Bengal Government was expo&s;ed to view. When they heard this, they thought it behoved them not to pa&s;s by &s;uch conduct, and which a poor ea&s;y man could not tell how to account for. They, therefore, ca&s;t about for a good-natured ea&s;y man, who &s;hould make that &s;ort of report, which might lay faults on both &s;ides; and, as a retro&s;pect could only tend to renew greivances, that the criminal &s;hould be left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his acqui&s;itions, and the people of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. They wi&s;hed it might appear, that the material cau&s;e of the in&s;urrection might be the determination of the Zemindars to pay no more rent. The Committee, however, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a Commi&s;&s;ioner to examine into the
<PB N="36" REF="79">
cau&s;e of the in&s;urrection, and they ca&s;t about to find a man that was fit to be a good re|pre&s;enter of affairs, that &s;o the channel of all this ferocity and wickedne&s;s &s;hould be con|cealed. Accordingly, they found out a man of a tolerable free character, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a man of moderation, almo&s;t to exce&s;s; mild, quiet, totally unconnected with party, and of peaceable character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it were of con&s;equence to expo&s;e Mr. Burke's blunders upon all occa&s;ions, the writer of this note would ob&s;erve, that the real character of Mr. Pater&s;on (except that he is a man of honour and integrity) is di|rectly the <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of Mr. Burke's de&s;cription. He is a gentleman of uncommonly <HI>lively parts,</HI> a very neat poet, an excellent companion, and, with great good nature in private life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an admirable turn for &s;atire, as every man of letters in Bengal well knew.

They thought that ju&s;t &s;uch a man as that, was exactly the man for their purpo&s;e; and they took it for granted, that from him they might expect an account in which faults &s;hould be left out on both &s;ides, and buried in oblivion; and it &s;hould be remembered, that a retro&s;pect could only tend to renew grievances. They cho&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="80">
well; but there never was a man &s;o mi&s;taken in the world. Mr. Pater&s;on, undert his quiet, hone&s;t character, concealed a vigorous mind, deciding under&s;tanding, and a feeling heart. He is the &s;on of a gentleman of venerable age, and extraordinary character, in this country, who long filled the &s;eat of Chairman of the Committee of Supply in the Hou&s;e of Commons, but is now retired to an honour|able re&s;t in the neighbourhood; this &s;on, as &s;oon as he was appointed to the commi&s;|&s;ion, dreaded the con&s;equences; but to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, he took out a letter that he had received from his father, which was the pre&s;ervation of his character, and the de&s;truc|tion of his fortune; and this letter enjoined him to pur&s;ue &s;uch a perfect line of con|duct, and to hazard every pro&s;ecution rather than to di&s;grace truth, that he went up into the country in a proper frame of mind to do his duty. I beg to read from his letter, how that gentleman found that country on his arrival, and how he accounts for the re|bellion.

Mr. Ha&s;tings never pronounced any opinion on the ca&s;e of Deby Sing, be|cau&s;e the enquiry was not completed during his Govern|ment; but he was &s;o much prejudiced again&s;t him, that he ordered him <HI>to be removed from all</HI> his appoint|ments <HI>pending the</HI> enquiry; and he declared, ju&s;t before he left Bengal, that &s;uch was his opinion of Deby Sing, that he thought he <HI>might</HI> be guilty of the enormities alleged again&s;t him, and that he <HI>might</HI> be able to con|ceal them from Mr. Goodlad.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM convinced that my continuation of this cau&s;e has been attended with &s;ome dif|ficulties
<PB N="44" REF="87">
to your Lord&s;hips, on account of my inability to proceed ye&s;terday; but your Lord|&s;hips' love of ju&s;tice has removed every ob|&s;truction, and I therefore proceed with con|fidence to the bu&s;ine&s;s now before your Lord&s;hips. I think, to the be&s;t of my re|membrance, the Hou&s;e adjourned at the period of time in which I was endeavouring to illu&s;trate the mi&s;chiefs that happened from Mr. Ha&s;tings throwing off his re&s;pon|&s;ibility, by delegating that power to a council, and in fact to Black Men, and the con&s;e|quence of it, in preventing the detection and the puni&s;hment of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;es that ever were known to be committed in India, or in any other part of the world. I &s;tated to you, that Mr. Commi&s;&s;ioner Pater&s;on was &s;ent into that country; that he was &s;ent, with all the authority of Government, with powers not only to hear, to report, but to redre&s;s the grievances which he &s;hould find; in &s;hort, there was nothing wanted to his power, but an hone&s;t Court to report to. He reported tho&s;e things which I delivered to you, and did very imperfectly, very faintly, and &s;hort|ly, according to my materials, &s;tate to you,
<PB N="45" REF="88">
that, in&s;tead of being furni&s;hed with that &s;hare of power which Mr. Ha&s;tings has en|deavoured to u&s;e on other occa&s;ions again&s;t tho&s;e who had incurred his private re&s;ent|ment, this man was put in all bu&s;ine&s;s of offence and defence, which the mo&s;t litigious and prevaricating laws that ever were in|vented to &s;creen peculation and power from the cries of an oppre&s;&s;ed people could effect. Mr. Pater&s;on, who as I &s;tated, was deputed, with all the authority of Government, to a great province, was now con&s;idered as a voluntary accu&s;er, and to make good the articles of his charge again&s;t Deby Sing; but I believe Deby Sing did not long remain in the hum|ble &s;inking &s;uppliant &s;ituation of a man under charges, or in a &s;econdary and &s;ubordinate &s;ituation, as an&s;wering tho&s;e charges. By degrees, as the protection increa&s;ed, his bold|ne&s;s grew along with it; he no longer took the tone of an accu&s;ed per&s;on, he rever&s;es the &s;ituation impo&s;ed on Mr. Patter&s;on; he beeomes Mr. Pater&s;on's accu&s;er; he began at fir&s;t to &s;ay, he believed he was mi&s;taken; took up things a little too warmly; he now &s;teps forward, charges him with forgery,
<PB N="46" REF="89">
and de&s;ires to be heard in this nominal Com|mittee. This bu&s;ine&s;s has now taken a third &s;hape; fir&s;t, Mr. Pater&s;on is a Commi&s;&s;ioner, to report; then he is to make good his charge; then he is accu&s;ed and ordered to an&s;wer the charges; this is the third metamorpho&s;is of Mr. Pater&s;on's &s;ituation. In this &s;ituation, which is what I will venture to &s;ay never hap|pened before in the annals of mankind, he was ordered to bring Deby Sing to pri&s;on, that in|famous character, that abandoned mortal, load|ed with crimes by the Committee them&s;elves. Deby Sing was committed under guard, but he was &s;oon taken from under that guard, and he &s;at a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by the &s;ide of Mr. Pa|ter&s;on. In &s;uch a &s;ituation all human con|&s;tancy would be &s;haken, and its manhood gone. To report the grievances of tho&s;e that had been rich, but were now undone by oppre&s;&s;ors, was invidious; the road of for|tune was ea&s;y to Mr. Pater&s;on. I believe you are convinced, that the Committee would not have received a different report, as a proof of bribery; they would rather have received it as tending to &s;often and conciliate this dif|ficult matter, and to &s;ettle the order of
<PB N="47" REF="90">
Government as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; but this man, who with&s;tood all temptations; who&s;e honour, fidelity, principle, and good cha|racter, received the thanks, and with&s;tood the thanks of tho&s;e that accu&s;ed him; this man was turned into the accu&s;ed per&s;on in this Committee. In this &s;ituation, I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, he never tottered one moment; he &s;tood like a hero<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of this part of the account is &s;o ex|tremely wild, that no man, without explanation, can under&s;tand it. Sir John Shore complained, that Mr. Pater&s;on's accounts were inaccurate or vague, and he cen&s;ured him for di&s;re&s;pect to the Committee. Mr. Pater&s;on replied; and after much altercation the Com|mittee &s;ent to the Supreme Council all their corre&s;|pondence with Mr. Pater&s;on, and <HI>every document and every information</HI> which they had received from him, relative to the in&s;urrection, and to the conduct of Deby Sing. The Supreme Council <HI>(Mr. Ha&s;tings being at Lucknow),</HI> viz.

<PB N="48" REF="91">
as a protector, when the people looked upon him as carrying with him the whole power of Government. He was forced to go back, to try whether among a mi&s;erable, ruined, undone, abject people, he was to find any who had courage enough to &s;tand to their former accu&s;ations; &s;uch treatment no &s;er|vant of Government ever received. The next &s;tep was to appoint another &s;et of Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, to try the que&s;tion between him and Deby Sing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Here Mr. Burke clo&s;es his account of the com|plaints which were made from Rungpore. We will therefore, in a very few words, give a fair &s;tate of the tran&s;actions relative to that province.</P>
<P>In the year 1781, Sir John Shore and the Committee of Revenue conceived that the Government ought to receive about &s;eventy thou&s;and rupees a year from that province, beyond the rent of the preceding year: and at that advanced rent Deby Sing agreed to take it, entering into obligations not to impo&s;e any additional taxes upon the Ryots. This engagement was for two years. The fir&s;t year's rent was paid without a ba|lance, or a complaint. When &s;ix months of the &s;econd year were expired, an in&s;urrection broke out in the province, and Mr. Pater&s;on was &s;ent by Sir John Shore and the Committee to enquire and report the cau&s;e of it. He tran&s;mitted to the Committee &s;everal papers, in which certain Zemindars and Ryots &s;tated the &s;everal facts which Mr. Burke has mentioned. To determine upon the truth of the&s;e complaints, the Su|preme Council appointed three &s;worn Commi&s;&s;ioners, and, after the fulle&s;t and the mo&s;t minute inve&s;tiga|tions, by far the greater number were found to have no &s;ort of foundation. In &s;ome in&s;tances, Deby Sing, following the example <HI>of the Zemindars,</HI> had collected the revenues with a rigour and &s;everity very unu&s;ual under the Briti&s;h Government in India, and he was com|pelled to make complete &s;atisfaction for every act of inju&s;tice he had committed; but, when the points in which he <HI>was culpable</HI> are compared with the <HI>accu&s;ations</HI> &s;tated by Mr. Burke, the man mu&s;t appear to be per|fectly innocent. The unju&s;tifiable deception of Mr. Burke was, in &s;tating all the facts, as if they had been <HI>proved</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed by evidence.</P></NOTE>, Who were tho&s;e gentle|men

<PB N="50" REF="93">
and he was to appear like an ac|cu&s;ed per&s;on, but without authority to make out &s;uch a &s;tate of defence as he could. In that &s;ituation he repre&s;ented and &s;ent, I be|lieve, one of the mo&s;t pathetic memorials that ever was &s;ent to a Council. He was a man of honour and principle, and well de|&s;erved, for his conduct, the honour of &s;uf|fering all the per&s;ecutions in the cau&s;e of virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pater&s;on applied to the Supreme Council for permi&s;&s;ion to go to Rungpore. This permi&s;&s;ion the Council, viz. Me&s;&s;rs.

He went back into that country without his commi&s;&s;ion. The junior &s;er|vants that were &s;ent to enquire into the iniquity, into the utter ruin of the country, &s;pent a long time in matters of form; but they found they could not do without a re|pre&s;entative, and Deby Sing was &s;ent down to them. This man was under an accu&s;a|tion; he was con&s;idered as a pri&s;oner, and according to the mild ways of that country, and e&s;pecially where they cho&s;e to be mild, he was not impri&s;oned in the common goal
<PB N="51" REF="94">
at Calcutta; not in the pri&s;on of the Fort; not in the goal where Nundcomar was put, when he appeared in Calcutta; he was put under &s;epoys; he was permitted to go abroad; and Mr. Ha&s;tings, with an addre&s;s which &s;eldom failed him, and never wanting to a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &pound;700,000, managed to con|vert this guard into a retinue of honour.&mdash;They attended him with their &s;ide-arms only, and marked him out as a great magi&s;trate, in|&s;tead of attending upon him as a guard. When he was ordered to &s;end a vaqueel, he refu&s;ed; upon which the Commi&s;&s;ioners, finding they could do without him, in&s;tead of &s;aying, if you will not &s;end, you are not to come your&s;elf, al|lowed him to come. It was not nece&s;&s;ary for him to be there, but he comes him&s;elf; and enters this place rather as a per&s;on arriving from vic|tory, than as a man under the load of the&s;e charges. The complainants &s;aw him a per|&s;on high in authority in the country. All the&s;e marks of re&s;pect &s;hould have been turned into marks of infamy to this infer|nal villain, who&s;e conduct, I have had the honour, or rather, I &s;hould &s;ay, I have been obliged, to mention to your Lord&s;hips.</P>

<P>Now, my Lords, to bring all this bu&s;ine&s;s home to Mr. Ha&s;tings.

I charge him with putting men of evil characters in &s;ituations, in which any evil might be committed. I charge him as Chief Governor with de&s;troying the in|&s;titutions of the country; which were, and ought to have been, the check upon this peo|ple.

I charge him with putting a per&s;on called a Steward, or <HI>Dewan</HI> of the province, as a controul on the Farmers General of it; &s;o that no controul &s;hould exi&s;t; and that he &s;hould be let loo&s;e to rapine and de&s;truction; for the two offices were both ve&s;ted in him.

But, in&s;tead of that, he appointed Gunga Govind Sing, and placed him in the &s;eat of government. Mr. Ha&s;tings is re&s;pon&s;ible for de&s;troying his own legal capacity; next for de&s;troying the legal capacity of the council; not one of whom could have any knowledge of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is &s;omething &s;o very foreign from the actual fact in this &s;tatement, that we &s;hall offer a few remarks upon it.

<P>It is true, Mr. Burke was not a <HI>&s;worn delegate</HI>; but no man of honour needs <HI>an oath,</HI> to keep him to the &s;trict line of his duty. He has well defined the functions <HI>of a delegate</HI>; let us examine how he exer|ci&s;ed tho&s;e functions him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was appointed <HI>one of the delegates</HI> of the la&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons. His duty was <HI>defined</HI>; namely, to make good <HI>certain articles,</HI> which <HI>that Hou&s;e</HI> had voted. Though the fact be true, that the Hou&s;e had never read by far the greater number of tho&s;e articles, yet Mr. Burke had an undoubted right to expatiate, as he plea&s;ed, on every allegation in tho&s;e articles, however irregularly or unju&s;tly they were voted. But in mani|fe&s;t contradiction <HI>to his own &s;en&s;e of the moral obligations impo&s;ed upon a delegate,</HI> he introduced the epi&s;ode of Deby Sing; a &s;ubject on which <HI>his con&s;tituents</HI> had never heard a word, and of cour&s;e they could give <HI>him</HI> no in&s;tructions upon it. Nor was this all; he told his &s;tory mo&s;t unfairly.</P>
<P>He impo&s;ed upon his auditors, by &s;tating the facts, as if the <HI>truth</HI> of them was beyond all que&s;tion, and that, con&s;equently, the only matter for con&s;ideration hereafter would be, whether Mr. Ha&s;tings and Sir John Shore could be made <HI>re&s;pon&s;ible</HI> for the facts. Yet Mr. Burke <HI>knew</HI> that the <HI>truth</HI> or <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> of the facts was a &s;ubject of a very long and &s;olemn enquiry, the re&s;ult of which was, as it has <HI>&s;ince</HI> appeared, that the facts charged were fal&s;e in their mo&s;t material parts. Where the charges were not without foundation, it was proved that they had been very greatly exaggerated.</P></NOTE>.</P>
