<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<L>THanks to my Stars, I have not ranged about</L>
<L>The Wilds of Life, 'ere I cou'd find a Friend;</L>
<L>Nature fir&s;t pointed out my <HI>Portius</HI> to me,</L>
<L>And early taught me, by her &s;ecret Force,</L>
<L>To love thy Per&s;on, 'ere I knew thy Merit;</L>
<L>Till, what was In&s;tinct, grew up into Friend&s;hip.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Port.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Marcus,</HI> the Friend&s;hips of the World are oft</L>
<L>Confed'racies in Vice, or Leagues of Plea&s;ure;</L>
<L>Ours has &s;evere&s;t Virtue for its Ba&s;is,</L>
<L>And &s;uch a Friend&s;hip end's not but with Life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Portius,</HI> thou know'&s;t my Soul in all its Weakne&s;s;</L>
<L>Then prithee &s;pare me on its tender Side,</L>
<L>Indulge me but in Love, my other Pa&s;&s;ions</L>
<L>Shall ri&s;e and fall by Virtue's nice&s;t Rules.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Port.</SPEAKER>
<L>When Love's well timed, 'tis not a Fault to love.</L>
<L>The Strong, the Brave, the Virtuous, and the Wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Sink in the &s;oft Captivity together.</L>
<L>I wou'd not urge thee to di&s;mi&s;s thy Pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>(I know 'twere vain) but to &s;uppre&s;s its Force,</L>
<L>Till better Times may make it look more graceful.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marc.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! thou talk'&s;t like one who never felt</L>
<L>Th' impatient Throbbs and Longings of a Soul,</L>
<L>That pant's, and reache's after di&s;tant Good.</L>
<L>A Lover do's not live by vulgar Time:</L>
<L>Believe me, <HI>Portius,</HI> in my <HI>Lucia</HI>'s Ab&s;ence</L>
<L>Life hang's upon me, and become's a Burden;</L>
<L>And yet when I behold the charming Maid</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="40">
I'm ten-times more undone; while Hope, and Fear,</L>
<L>And Grief, and Rage, and Love, ri&s;e up at once,</L>

<L><HI>Portius,</HI> thou oft enjoy'&s;t the Fair One's Pre&s;ence:</L>

<L>Fraternal Love and Friend&s;hip can in&s;pire.</L>
<L>Tell her thy Brother langui&s;he's to Death,</L>
<L>And fade's away, and wither's in his Bloom;</L>
<L>That he forgets his Sleep, and loath's his Food,</L>
<L>That Youth, and Health, and War are joyle&s;s to him:</L>
<L>De&s;cribe his anxious Days, and re&s;tle&s;s Nights,</L>

<L>Wilt thou behold me &s;inking in my Woes?</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Port.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, <HI>Lucia,</HI> Language is too faint to &s;how</L>
<L>His Rage of Love; it prey's upon his Life;</L>
<L>He pines, he &s;ickens, he de&s;pairs, he dies:</L>
<L>His Pa&s;&s;ions and his Virtues lie confu&s;ed,</L>
<L>And mixt together in &s;o wild a Tumult,</L>
<L>That the whole Man is quite disfigur'd in him.</L>

<L>WHAT odd fanta&s;tick Things we Women do!</L>
<L>Who wou'd not li&s;ten when young Lovers woo?</L>
<L>But die a Maid, yet have the Choice of Two!</L>
<L>Ladies are often cruel to their Co&s;t;</L>
<L>To give you Pain, them&s;elves they puni&s;h mo&s;t.</L>
<L>Vows of Virginity &s;hou'd well be weigh'd;</L>
<L>Too oft they're cancell'd, tho' in Convents made.</L>
<L>Wou'd you revenge &s;uch ra&s;h Re&s;olves&mdash;you may:</L>
<L>Be &s;pightful&mdash;and believe the thing we &s;ay,</L>
<L>We hate you when you're ea&s;ily &s;aid Nay.</L>
<L>How needle&s;s, if you knew us, were your Fears?</L>
<L>Let Love have Eyes, and Beauty will have Ears.</L>
<L>Our Hearts are form'd, as you your &s;elves wou'd chu&s;e,</L>
<L>Too proud to ask, too humble to refu&s;e:</L>
<L>We give to Merit, and to Wealth we &s;ell;</L>
<L>He &s;ighs with mo&s;t Succe&s;s that &s;ettles well.</L>
<L>The Woes of Wedlock with the Joys we mix;</L>
<L>'Tis be&s;t repenting in a Coach and &s;ix.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blame not our Conduct, &s;ince we but pur&s;ue</L>
<L>Tho&s;e lively Le&s;&s;ons we have learn'd from you:</L>
<L>Your Brea&s;ts no more the Fire of Beauty warms,</L>
<L>But wicked Wealth u&s;urps the Power of Charms;</L>
<L><PB REF="70">
What Pains to get the Gaudy Thing you hate,</L>
<L>To &s;well in Show, and be a Wretch in State!</L>
<L>At Plays you ogle, at the Ring you bow;</L>
<L>Even Churches are no Sanctuaries now.</L>
<L>There, golden Idols all your Vows receive;</L>
<L>She is no Godde&s;s that has nought to give.</L>
<L>Oh, may once more the happy Age appear,</L>
<L>When Words were artle&s;s, and the Thoughts &s;incere;</L>
<L>When Gold and Grandeur were unenvy'd Things,</L>
<L>And Courts le&s;s coveted than Groves and Springs.</L>
<L>Love then &s;hall only mourn when Truth complains,</L>
<L>And Con&s;tancy feel Tran&s;port in its Chains.</L>
<L>Sighs with Succe&s;s their own &s;oft Angui&s;h tell,</L>
<L>And Eyes &s;hall utter what the Lips conceal:</L>
<L>Virtue again to its bright Station climb,</L>
<L>And Beauty fear no Enemy but Time.</L>
<L>The Fair &s;hall li&s;ten to De&s;ert alone,</L>
