<L>FIRST, to defend a hackney'd thought,</L>
<L>Which forty diff'rent Bards have taught,</L>
<L>Without or pity, or remor&s;e,</L>
<L>You drag poor HORACE in by force,</L>
<L>Who&s;e ver&s;e thy ears could never reach,</L>
<L>But thro' the &s;tupid lines of CREECH;</L>
<L>And yet you bring one &s;entence pat in,</L>
<L>To &s;hew you've got a little <HI>Latin,</HI></L>
