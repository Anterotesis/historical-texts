<HEAD>The following Paragraphs, are extracted from THE THEATRE, (N^o 2.) a Paper, publi&s;h'd in <HI>London</HI> twice a Week, by Sir <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> (under the Name of Sir <HI>John Edgar,</HI>) in the Year 1722.</HEAD>
<P>LET any Man, who under&s;tands Conver&s;ation, or Bu&s;ine&s;s, that lives among&s;t knowing Men, either in Publick, or private Life, con&s;ider the Diflidence we are u&s;ually under, in executing any
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Part that naturally is our Duty, and requires only acting in Publick what is demanded of us in our or|dinary Characters and Functions; I &s;ay, let any one reflect on this, and he will account for the Concern and Confu&s;ion in which an Actor mu&s;t behold an Auditor &s;tir up any new Reflection, or Thought, in his old Adver&s;aries, the Vulgar, the Unthinking, and the Boi&s;terous, who have it in their Power by Noi&s;e, or Clamour (while he is to perform what is foreign to him&s;elf) to di&s;concert and pu&s;h him out of a per&s;onated Character, of Liveline&s;s, and Mirth, into his private one of Grief and Dejection: And yet, perhaps, in two Minutes it &s;hall be expected that he &s;hall be enough him&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume the Per|&s;on, whom (even to plea&s;e his Oppre&s;&s;ors) he is &s;till oblig'd to repre&s;ent. This Con&s;ideration is enough to gain him the Favour and Protection of rea&s;onable Men, tho' perhaps it may require Time to turn the Edge of Youths of fal&s;e Fire, natural Wickedne&s;s, and warm Blood, &s;o far as to look in upon them|&s;elves, and &s;ee how much they have wanted, and ought to learn Humanity.</P>
<P>The Humour in which People go to Plays is gene|rally that of Lei&s;ure, and Indolence, and the Enter|tainment gives them &s;uch a Notion of Levity and Chearfulne&s;s in the Performers, that they have not the &s;ame Idea of their laborious Life as they have of the Application of other u&s;eful People, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s does not require half the Sen&s;e and Dili|gence to be Ma&s;ters of it. They do not con&s;ider that Readine&s;s, Alacrity, Spirit, and Di&s;engagement from them&s;elves, are in no one Station of Life &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, as in the Duty of an accom|pli&s;h'd Actor: And if all the&s;e uncommon Qualities are not &s;ummon'd, and about him, at a certain Hour, his Intere&s;t and Reputation are lo&s;t at once: For he cannot even &s;ub&s;i&s;t without being always in a Readine&s;s to place him&s;elf in his be&s;t Appearance: Painful the Ta&s;k, and incumbent only on the under|valu'd Player!</P>

<HEAD>To the Ladies and Gentlemen who were Pre&s;ent at the Play of CATO la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am extreamly concerned for the Occa&s;ion of my addre&s;&s;ing you in this publick Manner, but as the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Di&s;appointment which you met with at my not being able to perform, has given ri&s;e to &s;everal Stories very little in my Favour, I think it my Duty to clear up the Matter and ju&s;tify my&s;elf. The Fact is thus: When I went to the Play-hou&s;e I found every thing in great Confu&s;ion, the People not paid and clamour|ing for their Money, the Mu&s;ick refu&s;ing to play un|le&s;s their Arrears were di&s;charged, and an Account brought at the &s;ame Time that Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the Direc|tor and Manager of the Whole had ab&s;conded. As I was dre&s;&s;ing for my Part, I found the Robe which I had before worn in CATO was wanting; upon enquiry I heard that Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> had come two Days before and taken it from the Hou&s;e, I had &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe that he had done it purely to prevent my Playing that Night, the Re&s;entment I conceived at &s;uch Treat|ment, the Concern I was under le&s;t the Audience &s;hould be di&s;appointed, &s;ome other ill U&s;age I receiv|ed, and &s;everal other Incidents concurring, (a Detail of which would take up too much Time) di&s;ordered me &s;o much that it not only rendered me incapable of doing Ju&s;tice to the Character I was to play, but like wi&s;e almo&s;t took away my voice. You your&s;elves were Witne&s;&s;es of this when I endeavoured to make an Apology and could not be heard. And indeed I was in &s;uch Confu|&s;ion that had I been heard I &s;hould not have been un|der&s;tood. I appeal to any rea&s;onable Per&s;on then pre|&s;ent whether it were better in the&s;e Circum&s;tances to di&s;mi&s;s the Hou&s;e (which was my Intention) or to keep them purely to convince them that it was not in my Power to get through one Speech of the Part. It has been &s;aid that the want of a Robe was a trifling Thing, and that the Audience would have been content to have received me in any Dre&s;s; they mu&s;t have but little Skill in Theatrical Affairs who think a proper Habit is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;lary, or that a Per&s;on can perform a Part well, with a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s about him that he looks it ill. This was more particularly my Ca&s;e in this Character, as it is one for which I am naturally very unfit in my Per&s;on, and in which nothing could have made my Appearance &s;upportable but a large Robe to cover my Defects, and give a Gravity and Dignity to my
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Per&s;on which I wanted and which are &s;o ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Character. I know when an Audience is di&s;appointed, they often make but little Allowances for the Actor, they feel nothing of the Concern and Anxiety of Mind he labours under when he has ac|quired a Reputation by performing a Character one Night, and &s;ees him&s;elf about to lo&s;e it in another. But it was not that nor the ill Treatment I had receiv|ed which hindered my Playing, it was the Effect which all this had on me. I had &s;o much Deference for the Audience, and &s;o much Gratitude; nay, it was &s;o much my Duty, that I &s;hould have &s;acrificed all Regard to Character, and every other Con&s;ideration, to have done my utmo&s;t to have plea&s;ed them even in the meane&s;t Dre&s;s, had I not found that my Voice was quite gone, and that it was not in my Power to go through with one Scene. I was then reduced to this Difficulty, either to detain them when I found I was not only incapa|ble of giving them the Satisfaction they might expect, but mu&s;t have given them the highe&s;t Di&s;gu&s;t in my Per|formance, or el&s;e fairly to tell them that it was not in my Power to play. I cho&s;e the latter; if it was an Er|ror it is one I have paid dearly for, &s;ince to that Prin|ciple I &s;acrificed above &s;ixty Pounds, which I ab&s;olutely lo&s;t by not playing. Such Per&s;ons as have a&s;&s;igned any other Cau&s;e for my not performing, if they can &s;uppo&s;e me either vain, or ungrateful, or even impudent enough to di&s;appoint an Audience meerly out of Whim or Hu|mour, I hope will not think me Fool enough to &s;tand to &s;uch a Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>And now (tho' I have already tre&s;pa&s;s'd too much on your Patience) I mu&s;t beg your Indulgence a little farther, as I perhaps &s;hall not have another Opportunity of doing it, in permitting me to return you and all the Ladies and Gentlemen of this Kingdom, who have honoured the Plays, in which I performed, with their Pre&s;ence, my &s;incere and hearty Thanks for all your Favours. The Suc|ce&s;s I have met with has been an additional Plea&s;ure to me, as by this Means you have convinced the World how fal&s;e that Opinion is which has prevail'd among&s;t &s;ome, that the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> are kinder to Strangers than to their own. For your great Indulgence to me is
<PB N="10" REF="9">
a manife&s;t Proof, how willing you are to encourage the lea&s;t Dawn of Merit in one of your Country. Yet, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, your great Favour, and the pro|digious Succe&s;s I have met with, have, I find, rais'd me many Enemies; there are &s;ome People who can not be|hold the Pro&s;perity of others in any way of Life with|out Envy; and as I am con&s;cious to my&s;elf that I have by no Action of mine de&s;erv'd the Hatred of any Per|&s;on, I mu&s;t believe I have no Enemies but &s;uch as my Succe&s;s has made &s;o. That I have &s;ome is manife&s;t from the Indu&s;try with which &s;ome People &s;pread Reports to my Di&s;advantage, and the Readine&s;s with which others believe them. My Gratitude to the Pub|lick, the Friend&s;hip I have experienc'd in Private, and the Love I have for my Country, would have detained me here much longer, (if I could in the lea&s;t have contributed to the Publick Entertainment,) in &s;pight of any Advantages I could have propros'd to my&s;elf in another Kingdom; I &s;hould be &s;or|ry a few Snakes in the Gra&s;s &s;hould drive me from &s;o fair a Field; but it is a Misfortune in our Way of Life that a few malicious People can do a Per&s;on more Injury in one Night, than the Friend&s;hip of the Publick in ge|neral can repair.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h that the Succe&s;s I have met with may be a Means of rai&s;ing up &s;ome Genius more wor|thy to entertain you, but this I will venture to &s;ay, that you will never find any, who has &s;tudied to do it with more Zeal and Indu&s;try, or who has a more grateful Sen&s;e of the many Obligations you have conferr'd</P>

<P>YOUR injudicious Di&s;appointment of the Company la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> who expected to &s;ee you in the Cha|racter of CATO, and your indi&s;creet Attempt to di&s;mi&s;s the Audience, having, as you confe&s;s, become a Town|talk, and given Ri&s;e to many idle Fal&s;hoods, meerly calculated to injure the Innocent: You mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I relate the Fact, &s;trictly adhering to Truth. There were many Witne&s;&s;es of what I am about to declare; and I know none, except your&s;elf, who&s;e Memory is weak enough to forget it, or will be hardy enough to deny it.</P>
<P>When it drew near the Time proper to begin the Play, Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> and my&s;elf were alarm'd, in the Dre&s;&s;ing-room with a Report, that you declared you would not play, becau&s;e you had not the &s;ame Robe you wore in that Character before; and that you &s;aid, The Audience mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;s'd. This Rea&s;on for di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing an Audience, (propos'd by you who had no Right to di&s;mi&s;s them) appear'd to me &s;o weak, I could not believe it, till you came into the Room, and &s;wore, Unle&s;s you had that Robe, you would not act. This Declaration I looked upon as a ra&s;h Expre&s;&s;ion, the meer Effect of your then ruf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">led Temper; but could not yet &s;uppo&s;e you would proceed &s;o idly as you did: You were then compleatly dre&s;s'd from Head to Foot (as well as ever the Character was dre&s;s'd in any Theatre in <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>England</HI>) all but the Robe.</P>
<P>Upon Enquiry, it appeared, the Robes worn by <HI>Cato, Juba</HI> and <HI>Sempronius,</HI> the fir&s;t Night, were borrowed
<PB N="12" REF="11">
by <HI>Philips,</HI> of &s;ome Gentlewoman in this Town, who bought them in an Auction at <HI>London,</HI> &s;ome Time &s;ince, but were by no Means the Property of the Managers, or any one belonging to the Theatre, nor were to be got that Night; &s;o all the Heroes were equally di&s;ap|pointed of tho&s;e Trappings. Your Impatience increa|&s;ed, and, tho' another Robe was brought you (the &s;ame Robe that was made new, this Year, for Mr. <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> in the Character of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar)</HI> you per&s;i&s;ted in ha|ving the other uncomeatable Robe, or you po&s;itively would undre&s;s, and was determined not to play. To e|very body's Surprize, you did undre&s;s, and, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t friendly Remon&s;trances to the contrary, you made a broken kind of Speech to the Audience; with which they were &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied, they could not help &s;hew|ing it.</P>
<P>Before you went on, I entreated you (on the meer ex|change of a Robe) not to do &s;o unpolitic a Thing, I might add, unpolite, as to think of di&s;appointing the Town of their Diver&s;ion: You reply'd, The Vexation had deprived you of your Voice, and rendered you in|capable of performing: I de&s;ir'd you to con&s;ider, the fir&s;t Act was of &s;uch a con&s;iderable Length, you might have Time enough to recover your Temper, and your Voice would probably return with it; or if the Defect la&s;ted, your attempting to perform would appear &s;o o|bliging, the Audience would readily make any Allow|ances, when they knew you had been ruffled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to think of giving them no Play at all, was what I could not but conceive would offend them.</P>
<P>To repeat all was &s;aid to you on this Occa&s;ion, would add to the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of this Recital: But, as near as I can remember, nothing was omitted, in the mo&s;t friendly Manner, to di&s;&s;uade you from your mi&s;taken Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am informed you &s;tay'd afterwards, ju&s;t long e|nough to hear the extraordinary indulgent Reception the Audience were plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on my propo&s;ing, with their Leave, to give them the Play, <HI>in the be&s;t Manner we could, &s;ince it was not in our Power to give it them &s;o well as we would.</HI> You then ran ha&s;tily out of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age afterwards to the Theatre,

<P>How comes it then, Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> reported, that Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> and my&s;elf, have intended you any injury?

<PB N="18" REF="17">
I &s;hall make no Reflections on it: but leave the Rela|tion thereof to the Impartial, and Unprejudic'd:&mdash;I &s;ay you occa&s;ion'd; for, the Pretence of the College being offended, is a meer Pretence; They are Men of Rea&s;on, and will not re&s;ent without a Cau&s;e: Nor is it a Reflection on the Society, that a few may be mi&s;led, by their mi&s;taken Partiality to you; that ought no more to bring an Odium on &s;uch a large and worthy Body, than that you were, once, an unworthy Member there|of, which the Majority, by this time, probably wi&s;h you ne'er had been.</P>
<P>Your Behaviour, Friend <HI>Thomas,</HI> has been &s;o bad, I doubt, if the &s;malle&s;t, or lowe&s;t, Body of People would chu&s;e you to mingle with 'em; I &s;earce believe, the mo&s;t indifferent Troop of Stroling Players, would chu&s;e to rank with you: Yet, 'tis methinks a Pity!

<P>Would any friendly Monitor convince me, how 'tis po&s;&s;ible for me, to have &s;aid, or done, ought to the Offence of any one in this Kingdom (you Ma&s;ter <HI>Tommy</HI> excepted) I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd not to acknowledge my Error, and would readily, as I ought, ask their Par|don.&mdash;But why &s;hould I wonder at your unho&s;pi|table Attempts towards a Stranger, when you could &s;o unmercifully threaten even a Brother, with being ill u&s;ed, if he pre&s;umed to play any Part of yours; this is a Fact naughty-paughty <HI>Tommy,</HI> too well known by many for you to deny.</P>
<P>But, pray Sir, by what Act of Parliament do you lay this monopolizing Claim, that, even during your Ab&s;ence from the Stage, no one mu&s;t pre&s;ume to ap|pear

In &s;hort, Sir, to end this Argument, which, I believe, you &s;carcely will pre|&s;ume to controvert, &s;ince the World was, <HI>One</HI> how|ever endeavoured to get a Superiority over <HI>Another,</HI> and ever hath &s;ucceeded, excepting &s;ome few In&s;tan|ces, as when <HI>One</HI> hath had all Advantages of a War, <HI>Another</HI> hath had all the Advantages of a Peace; but this is an Affair of &s;uch a Nature, that through a Multiplicity of Affairs, <HI>One</HI> is excu&s;able in having over-look'd it; be&s;ides it is of &s;o little importance, that it is &s;carce worth the Attention of any <HI>One,</HI> nei|ther need he be &s;olicitous to court the Embraces even of the lovely willing Nymph, OCCASION, what|ever Advances &s;he may make him, and in who&s;e Pow|er, alone it is to remedy &s;uch an Over-&s;ight: But let the Affairs of this World be conducted as they may, the Wi&s;e acknowledge that it is all <HI>One,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, it will be &s;o &s;ome time about one hundred Years hence; as &s;uch of them as are &s;killed in A&s;trology have often a&s;&s;ured me by Word of Mouth, nay, went &s;o far as to &s;ay, that they would give it me under their Hands, or to any <HI>One</HI> (they having a great E|&s;teem for my Family) annexed to a proper Scheme of Calculation, on which they would depend their whole Reputation, That no <HI>One,</HI> now alive, &s;hould ever complain that they were thereby deceived: And all This <HI>Gratis.</HI></P>
<P>Writing in any <HI>One</HI>'s Commendation, I know is irk&s;ome and tedious to <HI>Another,</HI> becau&s;e the Ani|mo&s;ity between us is &s;uch, (I mu&s;t &s;ay the Fault is yours) that you cannot be brought to believe any Thing favourable of me, more than I can of you; but admitting this as a Truth, I would with all the Moderation I have ever been Ma&s;ter of, recommend to your &s;erious and deliberate Thought, whether any Variance or Animo&s;ity of what kind &s;oever &s;hould come between <HI>One</HI> and <HI>Another</HI> by any Di&s;pute which might ari&s;e between Mr CIBBER and Mr. SHERIDAN?

the Attention of all <HI>Europe</HI> being <HI>Happily</HI> awaked by this and &s;ome other Matters of Importance, as e|very <HI>One</HI> wi&s;hes his own Ea&s;e, and never enjoys Satis|faction 'till he finds it is impo&s;&s;ible to obtain it; I would, I confe&s;s, for my own &s;ake, make any de|cent or Gentleman-like Advances towards an entire Peace, and will fully acknowledge all wherein I am con&s;cious I ever gave you Offence, hoping you will take it well that I u&s;e a little A&s;perity, which you cannot but indulge me in (you being an <HI>Author,</HI> and of con&s;equence <HI>dealt</HI> in Satyr, towards which your own Conduct could not fail to furni&s;h you with a great deal of, tho' po&s;&s;ibly not &s;ufficient Materials for a Liveli|hood) all Writers of every Cla&s;s, not excepting &s;uch as were never in a Cla&s;s at all, many of which being &s;upported (by the Printer) for abu&s;ing them|&s;elves in the mo&s;t outragious Manner, in &s;uffering the Pre&s;s to groan with their Labours, and bring forth Brats to publick View, when all Endeavours of their Friends to procure Abortion proved abortive.</P>
<P>I fir&s;t, therefore admit that many a <HI>One</HI> has wilful|ly abu&s;ed and &s;landered <HI>Another,</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding this, the partiality of the World towards me is &s;uch, that the entire blame hath ever been laid on <HI>Another; One,</HI> I confe&s;s, hath often defrauded <HI>Another,</HI> but is it not mo&s;t certain that <HI>Another</HI> has been equally cul|pable, and moreover, in the Opinion of the World, <HI>Another</HI> is a greater Rogue than any <HI>One.

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN's Addre&s;s to the Town.</HEAD>
<P>I Was in hopes I &s;hould not have had Occa&s;ion to trouble the Publick any more, but farther Misfor|tunes falling on me, and farther Crimes laid to my Charge, have put me under the Nece&s;&s;ity of Vindicat|ing my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that I &s;pirited up the Scholars to prevent Mr. CIBBER's preforming la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day.&mdash;</HI>In an&s;wer to this, I mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare, that upon reading the Adverti&s;ement which they had put in <HI>Faulk|ner</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> without my Knowledge, out of Zeal to my Intere&s;t, I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to find out the Gentlemen who had drawn it up, and by all the Ar|guments I was Ma&s;ter of, drew a Promi&s;e from them that they would not go to the Play-Hou&s;e the above Night. For the Truth of this, I appeal to them&s;elves. They have already publi&s;h'd an Adverti&s;ement in <HI>Reilly</HI>'s Paper of la&s;t <HI>Saturday,</HI> in which they have entirely clear'd me, and given Rea&s;ons why they altered their Re&s;olution. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Gentlemen I was hardly known to; if I had had a De&s;ign to have form'd a Par|ty in the College, I think it was mo&s;t probable that I &s;hould have applied to &s;uch as I had the Plea&s;ure of knowing: I appeal to them then, or any of them, whe|ther I ever &s;poke to them on that Head, unle&s;s it was to u&s;e their Endeavours to prevent any &s;uch Re&s;olution being enter'd into.</P>
<P>Tho' the Publick may have but little Regard to my bare Word on this Occa&s;ion, yet if they con&s;ider that after &s;o &s;olemn a Declaration, if what I &s;ay be fal&s;e, I put it in the Power of any one of the&s;e Gentlemen, at
<PB N="27" REF="26">
any Time, to prove me a Scoundrel, if they con&s;ider how low I mu&s;t fall, even in their Opinions, &s;hould I give what they know to be a Lie, under my Hand in a publick Manner, I hope no one will think that I would with my Eyes open commit &s;uch a Piece of Folly.</P>
<P>I well knew the fatal Con&s;equences of forming a Party, and too well fore&s;aw the U&s;e my Enemies would make of it, to my Di&s;advantage. For, indeed, what could I propo&s;e to my&s;elf by it, but to bring the Ha|tred of the Publick upon me, and what End would it an&s;wer? I never look'd on Mr. CIBBER as an Anta|goni&s;t of mine; I always had &s;o mean an Opinion of him in his Characters in Tragedy, that I would not e|ven wi&s;h that he &s;hould have the Reputation of being &s;uch by any Oppo&s;ition made on my Part; I hope the Publick will readily believe that I had no Cau&s;e to be afraid of his appearing in any Character of mine.</P>
<P>As to the impudent and &s;currilous Epi&s;tle which Mr. CIBBER publi&s;h'd, I was determined to take no Notice of it, for I thought him in every Re&s;pect beneath my lowe&s;t Re&s;entment; I did not care to wre&s;tle with a Sweep-chimney: But as I find there are a few who do not know the Man, led away by his fal&s;e Repre&s;entati|ons, and as he has endeavoured to abu&s;e that noble Principle, for which this Kingdom is &s;o ju&s;tly famed, and which I hope we &s;hall never lo&s;e, I mean that gene|rous Spirit of Ho&s;pitality derived to us from our Fore|fathers, to his own wicked Ends and Purpo&s;es, I think it nece&s;&s;ary for my own Sake, and for the Sake of the Publick, to unma&s;k this <HI>Jago,</HI> and lay him open to the World. In order to do this I &s;hall beg Leave to &s;tate one Fact.</P>
<P>The Night that I was to have performed <HI>Cato</HI> (an unfortunate Night for me) when a thou&s;and unfore&s;een Accidents had thrown me into &s;uch a di&s;order'd State of Mind as I had never known before, I found of a &s;ud|den Mr. CIBBER's Behaviour, which before was very complai&s;ant, or rather meanly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, was totally changed; in&s;tead of trying all Methods to appea&s;e a Per&s;on be&s;ide him&s;elf with Pa&s;&s;ion, he did all he could
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to aggravate Matters: When I a&s;ked him what I &s;hould do in this Exigence, for want of a Robe? He an&s;wer|ed, &s;omewhat &s;hortly, play without a Robe: When, upon that, I laid open to him what a de&s;picable Figure I &s;hould make, he turn'd upon his Heel, and &s;aid, D&mdash;n me if I care what you do, the Play &s;hall not &s;tand &s;till for you; and immediately went and ordered the Prompter to draw up the Curtain. When I heard this, I was &s;tunn'd at the In&s;olence of the Fellow, who nei|ther had any Right to command in that Hou&s;e, nor was in any Shape intere&s;ted in the Event of that Night. It put me pa&s;t all Patience, and the Terror I was under, le&s;t the Curtain &s;hould be drawn up before I had Time to make an Apology, at a Time that I found my&s;elf in|capable of playing, made me ru&s;h like a Madman pre|cipitately on the Stage, before I had con&s;idered what I &s;hould &s;ay to the Audience. Mr. CIBBER, to my great Surprize, came on immediately after me, and very offi|ciou&s;ly (to give it no har&s;her Term) offered to read the Part of <HI>Cato,</HI> at the &s;ame Time that he was to play <HI>Sy|phax.</HI> I &s;ay officiou&s;ly; for if I can make it appear that he was no way concerned, either in Point of Intere&s;t or Money, the World will judge &s;o too.</P>
<P>Mr. CIBBER knows, that the Actors had determin|ed to &s;eize on the Receipts of that Night, and all the &s;ucceeding ones, except the next, (the entire Receipts of which were to have been mine) to pay them&s;elves their Salaries, of which they had been defrauded by the Roguery of &s;ome of the Managers. He knows, that the Rea&s;on of his continuing to play on afterwards, was only to fulfil his Agreement, that he might have an Opportunity of &s;uing the Per&s;ons he contracted with for the Sum &s;tipulated. He knows (notwith&s;tanding his plau&s;ible Pretence in his Epi&s;tle, for chu&s;ing the Cha|racters which he gave out) that he intended to perform, in the&s;e Words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And was it not rea&s;onable for us to propo&s;e acting &s;uch Pieces as might excite the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in the Town, <HI>whereby the Managers might be enabled to pay us and the re&s;t of the Company.</HI>"</Q> I &s;ay, he knows that not a Shilling of this was either to go to the Managers or to them. He knows, that he had a Lawyer's Opinion, That it was not nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="29" REF="28">
him to perform the Number of Nights mentioned tn their Agreement, it was &s;ufficient if he was ready io perform them in the limited Time. He knows, that he reckoned into one of the Number the Play of the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> which was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Night before. What then could prompt Mr. CIBBER to make &s;uch an extravagant and impudent Propo&s;al to the Audience, as that of reading the Character of <HI>Cato,</HI> when at the &s;ame Time he was to play <HI>Syphax.</HI> I &s;ay, what could prompt him to give him&s;elf &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble, if he was no way obliged to it, either in Point of Duty, Intere&s;t, or Money. It was a malicious and wicked Scheme which he had long had in Agitati|on, and which my Misfortune that Night fir&s;t gave him an Opportunity of putting in Practice. It was a De&s;ign of building his Fame upon my Ruin.</P>
<P>In order to prove this I &s;hall, fir&s;t of all, give a &s;hort Account of my Behaviour to Mr. CIBBER, &s;ince his Arrival in this Kingdom. To proceed in his own Me|thod, I &s;hall beg Leave to a&s;k him a few Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Is he not con&s;cious, that had it not been for me he could not have &s;et his Foot on any Stage in this Kingdom?</P>
<P>Did I not qua&s;h a Cartel, which was &s;igned by the Managers of both Companies, under &s;evere Penalties, to exclude him from acting on either Stage?</P>
<P>Did I not, as a Stranger, treat him with all Civility, tho' the unhappy Character he labour'd under prevented my having any Friend&s;hip with him?</P>
<P>Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr. <HI>Sloper</HI> and him, and the Letters which pa&s;&s;ed between him and his Wife, from being reprint|ed here &s;oon after his Arrival: And did I not com|mi&s;&s;ion a Friend to offer the Expence of the Impre&s;&s;ion, out of my own Pocket, rather than a Stranger &s;hould be hurt?</P>
<P>Did I not promi&s;e him to &s;tudy any new Character for his &s;econd Benefit? (A Favour which I had refu&s;ed to others much more worthy of it.)</P>
<P>Did I not, when I found Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> trifling with him, and refu&s;ing to perform the Contract, before his Face declare, that I never would in any Shape be con|cern'd with Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> hereafter, if he did not pay
<PB N="30" REF="29">
him, nay, more, offer'd to play with Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> in the other Hou&s;e; to try by that Means to make up his Lo&s;s?</P>
<P>Did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;ay on that Occa&s;ion, that I behav'd with &s;uch Honour, and laid him under &s;uch Obligations, that he only wi&s;h'd for an Opportunity to return them?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t he had was the above mention'd unhappy Night. Might not one rea&s;onably expect after all this, that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> would not try to injure me if I did nothing to injure him? But he had worn the Ma&s;k too long, he found an Opportunity of throwing it off, and leap'd at it with the greate&s;t Eagerne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the many Obligations I had laid him under to me; he could not forgive me, that my Name brought full Hou&s;es when he was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s, or to play to empty Benches. His Envy, Spleen, and Malice, which long lay &s;mother'd in his Brea&s;t, now bur&s;t forth into a Blaze. He &s;aw me under the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;appointing an Audience, and con&s;equently di&s;obliging them. He contributed as far as in him lay to the one, and was determin'd to improve the other.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn that he was not obliged, by any Principle of Duty or Profit, to this Work of Supe|rerogation; it mu&s;t be then from &s;ome other Motive, <HI>Complai&s;ance to the Audience, perhaps.&mdash;</HI>Impudent as he is he cannot think that the doing &s;o unprecedented a Thing, as that of reading a capital Part, and playing another at the &s;ame Time, could give them any Plea|&s;ure; an Attempt which no one but him&s;elf could ever have thought of, and which even his own Hardine&s;s mu&s;t have been &s;hocked at had he not had the blacke&s;t Malice in his Heart to prompt him to it. He &s;aw the Audience greatly offended at the Di&s;appointment they met with in my not being able to perform, and very ju&s;tly too, fince it was not in my Power to give them the Rea&s;ons which prevented it. He laid hold of this Opportunity, at once, to run me down in the Opinion of the World, and ingratiate him&s;elf by the Appear|ance of an officious Zeal <HI>to do every Thing that might give Plea&s;ure to the Publick.</HI> He hoped by this Means to drive me out of the Kingdom, and to e&s;tabli&s;h him|&s;elf
<PB N="31" REF="30">
here for the next Winter, as he knows it is im|po&s;&s;ible for him to return to <HI>London.</HI> This is the more probable, as I had often declar'd in Confidence to him, that I &s;hould never be able to &s;tand the Shock of any Party form'd again&s;t me. His &s;ub&s;equent Behaviour is a manife&s;t Proof of his De&s;ign: For after I had left the Playhou&s;e, and &s;ent Word, in the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, that I &s;hould never play there again, Mr <HI>Cibber,</HI> for fear I &s;hould cool upon it, or try to reconcile the Fa|vour of the Town to me again, in a violent Hurry gave out three Plays together (a mo&s;t unu&s;ual Thing, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of Benefits) in two of which he was to appear in Characters of mine. By this Means, let me have been ever &s;o innocent, had not the other Company been in Town, I mu&s;t have quit the Field to him, and left him triumphant.</P>
<P>This was not all&mdash;</P>
<P>When I endeavour'd to vindicate my&s;elf to the Publick, and make an Apology for not performing, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> undertook to an&s;wer me. What Right, or what Colour like to Right, had he to undertake it? I made no mention of him in the Paper which I publi&s;h'd, tho' I had a ju&s;t Rea&s;on to do it; becau&s;e I did not care to be embroil'd with a Man of his trouble &s;ome Temper, who has always kept every Theatre in which he was engag'd, in hot Water. I had hitherto had no Quarrel to him, I had done him &s;ome Favours, &s;hould he not if he had the lea&s;t Humanity (to leave Gratitude out of the Que&s;tion) have endeavour'd rather to clear me in the Opinion of the Town than endeavour to hurt me, I cannot find that he him&s;elf has given any tole|rable Colour for his entering &s;o eavalierly a Volunteer in the Cau&s;e. His &s;etting out, where certainly he ought to have given &s;ome Rea&s;on for his undertaking &s;uch a Part, is no more than this; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> Your injudicious Di&s;appointment of the Company la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> who expected to &s;ee you in the Cha|racter of <HI>Cato,</HI> and your indi&s;creet Attempt to di&s;|mi&s;s the Audience, having, as you confe&s;s, become a Town-talk, and given Ri&s;e to many idle Fal&s;hoods, merely calculated to injure the Innocent, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I relate the Fact, &s;trictly adhering to
<PB N="32" REF="31">
Truth."</Q> So that here he does not pretend to give any Rea&s;on, only, <HI>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me.</HI></P>
<P>Here and thro' the whole Epi&s;tle, you may ob&s;erve by his ill-natur'd and bitter Expre&s;&s;ions, his per&s;onal Pique and Spleen to me, who never had injur'd him. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> mentions in the Cour&s;e of his Letter, that he heard I had &s;pread about &s;everal Reports to his Di&s;advantage, but why did Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who&s;e Motto to this Epi&s;tle is, <HI>It is a kind of Slander to tru&s;t to Rumour,</HI> &s;o readily believe tho&s;e Reports of one with whom he had hitherto liv'd on a good Footing. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> had heard the &s;ame Thing in regard to him&s;elf, but he, like a Gentleman, came and a&s;k'd me the Truth of it, and I &s;atisfy'd him. Why did not Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> if he had the lea&s;t of a Gentleman about him, behave in the &s;ame Manner, before he ventur'd to publi&s;h them to the World, and draw Con|clu&s;ions from them, as Truths, to my Di&s;advantage? No, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> neither wanted, nor wi&s;h'd that I &s;hould ju&s;tify my&s;elf; his Affairs were grown &s;o de&s;pe|rate, that he had no Hope left but, by a Train of villainous Calumnies, and a Pro&s;u&s;ion of &s;currilous Language, to try to make me do &s;omething mon&s;trous, to plunge me &s;till deeper in the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Town; at lea&s;t he had Hopes that this Conduct might rouze (perhaps) the indi&s;creet Zeal of &s;ome of my Friends or Well-wi&s;hers, to attempt &s;omething again&s;t him which he would be &s;ure to lay at my Door. Un|happily for me, the latter Part &s;ucceeded to his Wi&s;h.</P>
<P>To prove that this was his Principle, I &s;hall only make u&s;e of one Argument. I &s;hall not pretend to ju&s;tify or condemn the Gentlemen of the College, it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the World may ea&s;ily &s;ee how tickli&s;h a Point that would be for me to handle. All I &s;hall endeavour to do, is, to prove that Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> knowingly and willingly, brought it upon him&s;elf. He treated the Adverti&s;ement which they had put into the <HI>Journal,</HI> in a contemptuous and in&s;olent Way, on a Suppo&s;ition that they were mine. But no one &s;hall make me believe that any Man of common Sen&s;e, as I will allow Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> to be, could &s;uppo&s;e me either fooli&s;h enough or ba&s;e enough to do it. Had I wrote &s;uch an
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Adverti&s;ement in the Name of the Gentlemen of the College, was it not natural for them to enquire who it was that dar'd to make u&s;e of their Name, and had I done it, what Puni&s;hment would have been too great for my Pre&s;umption?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> might ea&s;ily have known of Mr. <HI>Faulkner,</HI> whether they had left it there or no. Upon this Pro|bability then, that he mu&s;t have known it was theirs, what could Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> expect from a Set of young Gentlemen, who are, thro' their Youth, warm? What could he hope for, but that they would &s;hew their Re&s;entment for this contemptuous Manner of treating what they had wrote? Nay, mu&s;t he not expect, that probably they would think them&s;elves bound in Honour to take &s;ome publick Method of convincing him that they had wrote it, le&s;t the Calumny which he had ca&s;t upon me, thro' their Silence, &s;hould be fix'd upon me. People may wonder that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;hould run &s;uch a Ri&s;que from &s;uch a Motive; but he has been &s;o ac|cu&s;tom'd to Things of this Nature, that they appear to him but as common Matters. The Plea&s;ure he pro|po&s;ed to him&s;elf in having an Opportunity of di&s;play|ing his Eloquence the next Day, of throwing at the Feet of the Publick <HI>an unfortunate Stranger unho&s;pitably us'd,</HI> and above all the joyful Hope of being able to fix this Di&s;turbance upon me, as it's Author, wou'd, he thought, more than compen&s;ate for any Thing he could &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> is the more inexcu&s;able, as I took all Pains to prevent his doing any ra&s;h Thing, which might draw more Odium on him from the Gentlemen of the College; I told Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> and &s;everal others of the Players, that it might reach his Ears, that I had been with the Gentlemen of the College, to prevent any Mi&s;chief, not for Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s &s;ake, (for I owed him no Favour) but my own: That I had laid open to them the ill Con&s;equences that would attend me, &s;hould any Di&s;turbance happen at the Theatre, that upon this, they had all promi&s;ed in a &s;olemn Manner not to go; and I bid them a&s;&s;ure Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> that he need not fear any Interruption. Notwith&s;tanding this, he pub|li&s;hed his Epi&s;tle afterwards, wherein the Gentlemen of
<PB N="34" REF="33">
the College thought them&s;elves per&s;onally ill-treated, and were rouz'd into &s;uch a Rage, as no Endeavours of mine or all Mankind could have appeas'd.</P>
<P>Does not this Conduct of his evidently prove, that he &s;hut his Eyes to Conviction, that he was determin'd at all Events to pur&s;ue the Scheme he had laid down; it either mu&s;t be owing to this, or to the &s;trange&s;t In|fatuation that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Man. As to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Po&s;t&s;cript, I read it without any Emotion, and heartily thank him for it. He has there painted him&s;elf in &s;tronger Colours than either I could, or my Humanity would &s;uffer me to do. His ridiculous Challenge, in the true Stile of an <HI>Ancient Pi&s;tol,</HI> &s;ent to me by all the News-Boys in Town, I de&s;pi&s;e. He has put him&s;elf, by his Behaviour, far beneath the Footing of a Gen|tleman. I &s;hall go about my Bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual; if I am attack'd, I &s;hall endeavour to defend my&s;elf, nor &s;hall I ever be afraid of any who dare do Wrong. And now I have done with him&mdash;I am &s;orry I have been compelled to &s;hew any Man in &s;o bad a Light, but the World mu&s;t do me the Ju&s;tice, to own, he has forced me to do it in my own Defence. I &s;hall trouble my Head no farther with him, but leave him to Heav'n,<Q><L>And to the Thorns which in his Bo&s;om lodge,</L>
<L>To goad and &s;ting him.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is now Time I &s;hould addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Pub|lick. There are two Things laid to my Charge; one is, That I &s;pirited up the Gentlemen of the College to rai&s;e a Di&s;turbance in the Theatre.&mdash;A heavy Charge indeed, if true: I have done all that is in the Power of Man to clear my&s;elf of it, and I hope there is none of the lea&s;t Humanity but will acquit me. The other is, That I willingly di&s;obliged the Publick in not play|ing the Part of <HI>Cato.</HI></P>
<P>I publi&s;hed an Apology, not without con&s;ulting a Gentleman, of great Knowledge and Experience in the World, in it, which, perhaps, the over Ea&s;ine&s;s of my Friends thought a &s;ufficient Defence. Perhaps, indeed, I impo&s;ed on my&s;elf as well as them.</P>
<P>If there be any who think I meant them an Offence, that I did it thro' Wantonne&s;s, or thro' Contempt of the Audience, I heartily a&s;k their Pardon; and the
<PB N="35" REF="34">
only Way I have left to make them Amends, is to exert my&s;elf in that Character on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> next, if they will honour me with their Company that Night. The Matter is come to this I&s;&s;ue, that I mu&s;t either ri&s;e or fall in the Opinion of the World by the Event of that Night. If I am the Per&s;on Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> repre&s;ents; if I was an unworthy Member of the College; (which my old Cotemporaries there, and tho&s;e Ornaments of Learning, the Fellows, who knew my Behaviour, will hardly take his Word for) if I am not fit to be received in a Company of Strollers (for which Compli|ment the many People of Fa&s;hion, who have honoured me with their Acquaintance in private, and their Approba|tion in publick, are much obliged to him) I am not, indeed, worthy of your Countenance: You all know me; I have lived among&s;t you; if I have the lea&s;t Title to your Favour, I hope the Good-nature of my Friends, and the Benevolence of the Publick, which I have &s;o often, and in &s;o extraordinary a Manner, expe|rienced, will not de&s;ert me in this Exigence, nor &s;uffer me to fall a Sacrifice to the mean Artifices, and be bani&s;hed my Country by the wicked Schemes of a&mdash;no, I will not put my&s;elf &s;o much on a Level with him as to call him by the Name he de&s;erves&mdash;who, I am well a&s;&s;ur'd, dare not &s;hew his Face in his own.</P>
<P>If any Expre&s;&s;ions too warm or indi&s;creet have drop'd from me, in the Cour&s;e of this Addre&s;s, I hope for the Indulgence of the Publick, when I inform them that I have been obliged to draw it up almo&s;t in the &s;pace of one Day, and that too in no very ea&s;y &s;tate of Mind. For I que&s;tion whether the innocent Man, tho' he has great Advantages over the other, feels le&s;s than the Man of Guilt, while he is labouring under a Load of Calumny. My whole Intention was to endeavour to clear my&s;elf, with all Duty, Deference and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Publick, who&s;e humble Servant I am,</P>

<P>WHEN I call this a <HI>Proper Reply,</HI> I mean &s;uch a one as may be <HI>fitting for the Publick to read,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> &s;uch a one <HI>as</HI> Sheridan <HI>ought to receive.</HI> With|out playing the Critick on his non&s;en&s;ical, tautological Stile, and rambling Inconnections, I &s;hall only take this Notice of his Scurrility: Foul Language, in an Addre&s;s to the Publick, is an Affront to their Ears: 'tis a Breach of good Manners, and almo&s;t as unpar|donable as throwing Gla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Company. There's neither Wit, Sen&s;e, Plea&s;antry, or Bravery in either.&mdash;That it is &s;aid by many that <HI>Mr.</HI> Sheridan <HI>&s;pirited up &s;ome Per&s;ons to create a Di&s;turbance in the Theatre,</HI> is a known truth, and it is al&s;o a truth that many firmly believe it, from well-grounded Rea&s;ons. SHERIDAN<HI>'s</HI> pretending to know nothing of the Adverti&s;ement and Letter, fir&s;t publi&s;h'd in Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI>'s Journal, is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing, after many other Things he has mode&s;tly ventur'd to a&s;&s;ert, even when Numbers know the contrary. Mr. ARNE told me at the <HI>Rainbow Coffee-hou&s;e,</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t, in Company with &s;eve|ral others, that he had been ju&s;t talking with Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> at the <HI>Globe Coffee hou&s;e,</HI> who, among other Things, declared his Opinion, That it was indi&s;creet in Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> to cau&s;e, or &s;uffer, &s;uch Things to be publi&s;h'd; 'twould be more likely to prejudice than &s;erve him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that he had advis'd Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> to the contrary&mdash;who&s;e Reply was<HI>&mdash;He was determin'd.&mdash;</HI>Be&s;ides this, 'tis notorious he had &s;everal Per&s;ons
<PB N="37" REF="36">
to dine or &s;up with him, on different Days, and had lo&s;t no Time, nor &s;pared any Money in Chair Hire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to alarm all Parts of the Town, as well as his particular Intimates, he was an injur'd Per&s;on, for&s;ooth! tho' in what, has not yet appear'd. Add to this his previous Declarations to any one's appearing in any Part he had thought of playing; his threatning them with an ill Reception from his Friends, over whom he boa&s;ted a particular Sway (no great Compliment to them by the way) and what mu&s;t we think of this Man; or what Regard ought the Publick to have ei|ther to his Word or Oath?</P>
<P>The Riot that en&s;ued on the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> following, is known to the whole Town; their Sentiments of it will better come from their Mouths than my Pen.&mdash;The Town's generous and uncommon Reception and Protection of me &s;ince, was an In&s;tance what an Abhor|rence they had of the former ra&s;h Behaviour of a few, mi&s;led by a very bad Man:&mdash;I mu&s;t have Recour&s;e to his Vocabulary, e'er I can find Words low enough to paint him. The extraordinary kind Treatment the Publick afforded me on <HI>Monday</HI> Night in the Character of Othello, I am con&s;cious, was more owing to their &s;pirited ho&s;pitable U&s;age of a Stranger, than any Me|rits, my Attempts to plea&s;e them, could lay claim to:&mdash;I have a &s;incere and grateful Sen&s;e of their Favours; it warms my Heart, and I &s;hall always think it a Duty incumbent on me, loudly to acknowledge an Act &s;o much to their Honour: I confe&s;s it here, and &s;hall not forget it when in <HI>England,</HI> to which Place I propo&s;e returning &s;peedily;&mdash;tho' the mode&s;t, the brave Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> who&s;e Veracity is to be ranked with his other Virtues, is plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert the Impo&s;&s;ibility of my returning. I &s;hall contradict him by Facts, not by dirty Language.</P>
<P>Let me inform him, all bad Expre&s;&s;ions retort upon the Slanderer; let then his own &s;currilous Libel &s;tick on him&s;elf, till he wipes it off like a Gentleman. His Affectation of treating me with Contempt, as an Actor, is &s;uch a pretty Piece of pre&s;umptive Vanity, that his choice Opinion alone &s;hould lead the Town, and &s;uch a paltry Puff of his own Prai&s;e, as is only fit to be
<PB N="38" REF="37">
laugh'd at&mdash;But how, if the <HI>Great Sheridan</HI> &s;hould have given &s;omething, under his own Hand, quite contradictory to this mean Opinion of a Man <HI>whom,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>he had no Cau&s;e to be afraid of?</HI> What will Gentlemen think of <HI>Tommy</HI> then? Why,&mdash;as they think of him already.&mdash;As I chu&s;e Facts, rather than meer A&s;&s;ertions, to contradict his Calumny and Fal&s;hoods, I de&s;ire the Patience of the Publick to read the following Letter, &s;ent from Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> to me, in a Letter inclos'd to Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> then in <HI>London;</HI> the Date &s;ays when.</P>

<P>THO' I have not the favour of being known to you, yet I make bold to write to you about an Affair, in which you are concern'd as well as I. <HI>I hear the Gentlemen of</HI> Aungier-&s;treet <HI>Theatre, intend to make Propo&s;als to you about a Summer Expedition to this Kingdom;</HI> as I had &s;ome Thoughts of doing the &s;ame in favour of the People of <HI>Smock-alley,</HI> this Intelli|gence has ha&s;ten'd my Application to you per&s;onally, which otherwi&s;e might appear too abrupt. There are many Rea|&s;ons why <HI>I &s;hould think it our mutual Intere&s;t to play in one Hou&s;e.</HI> In the fir&s;t place, if we act in different Hou&s;es, the Town will po&s;&s;ibly be divided, and the Re|ceipts of both will nece&s;&s;arily be much le&s;&s;en'd. Not that I &s;hould expect this upon the footing of Merit, but I know not how it is, whether it be their Partiality to their Countryman, or whether it be owing to the power|ful Intere&s;t of a Number of Friends that I have in this City, but there never was known &s;uch Encouragement, &s;uch Applau&s;e given to any Actor, or &s;uch full Hou&s;es as &s;ince I appear'd on the Stage. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> will in|form you that <HI>Dublin</HI> is not like <HI>London,</HI> we have not two Audiences in the whole City, e&s;pecially <HI>as the Town is now more empty than it has ever been known.</HI> Be&s;ides, as it is not improbable, but that we may be together next Winter, it will be a great Advantage to practice &s;uch Plays together, as we can both appear in <HI>I am commi&s;&s;ion'd to a&s;&s;ure you from the Managers of</HI> Smock-alley, <HI>and I will al&s;o do it from my&s;elf, that you &s;hall</HI>

You may think, <HI>it is my own Intere&s;t that has prompted me to write to you,</HI> 'tis very true, <HI>I have no &s;mall Cau&s;e to be afraid of &s;o potent an Antagoni&s;t,</HI> but I believe upon mature Deliberation, you will al&s;o find it your Intere&s;t to be with us.

<P>To this I wrote an An&s;wer, I believe, not unbe|coming a Gentleman to &s;end, or a Gentleman to re|ceive:<HI>&mdash;Sheridan</HI> may print it, if he plea&s;es; I hope he won't alter it tho'.&mdash;As I have been honoured with a Me&s;&s;age from the Heads of the College, to &s;ig|nify their Dete&s;tation of the outrageous Proceedings at the Theatre, on the Night <HI>Othello</HI> was fir&s;t intended; and tho&s;e Gentlemen having ab&s;olutely di&s;claimed any of the Adverti&s;ements being any Act of the College; but, on the contrary, look on 'em as a Reflection and Affront on that worthy Body, <HI>let</HI> Sheridan <HI>make 'em Li|bellers, not I;</HI> I &s;ay <HI>Sheridan,&mdash;Sheridan</HI> who carried that Piece of Rhetorick la&s;t <HI>Friday</HI> to Mr. <HI>Faulkner,</HI> who prudentially <HI>cho&s;e not to affront his worthy Fellow Citizens,</HI> as he declar'd to <HI>Sheridan:&mdash;</HI>indeed, Ma&s;ter <HI>Tommy,</HI> to &s;often it, it &s;eems, alter'd the Word <HI>Butchers</HI> to <HI>Ruffians;</HI> a tender Apellation! and then was angry with Mr. <HI>Faulkner,</HI> who po&s;itively refu&s;ed to in&s;ert it: Some other Printers did in&s;ert it, who have confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>Sheridan brought it to 'em.</HI> Here it may not be impro|per to tran&s;cribe <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s third Paragraph of his mo|de&s;t Addre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">Tho' the Publick may have but little Regard to my bare Word on this Occa&s;ion, yet if they con&s;ider that after &s;o &s;olemn a Declaration, if what I &s;ay be fal&s;e, <HI>I put it in the Power of any one of the&s;e Gentle|men, at any Time, to prove me a</HI> SCOUNDREL, if

they con&s;ider how low I mu&s;t fall, even in their Opi|nions, &s;hould <HI>I give what they know to be a</HI> LIE, <HI>under my Hand in a publick Manner,</HI> I hope no one will think that I would with my Eyes open commit &s;uch a Piece of Folly.</Q></P>
<P><HI>O</HI> Sheridan! Sheridan! <HI>Quae te dementia caepit?</HI></P>
<P>You little thought, when you wrote this, that Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> had declar'd his refu&s;ing the Adverti&s;ement, or that Mrs. <HI>Reilly</HI> had &s;ent Word to the College, that <HI>You</HI> brought the Adverti&s;ement to her, in which <HI>you</HI> chang'd the Word <HI>Butchers</HI> to <HI>Ruffians;</HI> and by which, in the Name of the <HI>abus'd College, you</HI> clear <HI>your&s;elf</HI> of knowing any thing of the Matter: Any one may be &s;atisfied of the Truth of this, who will give them&s;elves the Trouble to call at the Printers.</P>
<P>As to the In&s;inuation of my procuring Ruffians (as the well bred <HI>Sheridan</HI> may &s;tile them) to be at the Theatre, I appeal to the Publick, if I have not al|ways, in any Di&s;cou&s;e I ever held on the Subject, made it my earne&s;t Reque&s;t, every Step &s;hould be a|voided that might di&s;turb the publick Peace; and I hop|ed none would be omitted to pre&s;erve it. If any hone&s;t Man will &s;tep forth, and &s;ay, I have not acted thus, or ever de&s;ir'd any one to be pre&s;ent, to give me a forced Applau&s;e, let this, I &s;ay, be proved, and I'll bow me to the Shame <HI>Tom Sheridan</HI> de&s;erves for all his Fal&s;hoods.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age I was favour'd with from the College, as aforementioned, I begg'd my humble Re&s;pects might be acceptable; and tho' I was pre&s;&s;ed to mention the Names of tho&s;e who were concerned in the Di&s;turbance, I de&s;ir'd to be excus'd, &s;ince, as I was a Stranger to their Per&s;ons, I might po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;inform'd; and, tho' I had been advi&s;ed to addre&s;s the Provo&s;t on this Occa&s;ion, nay, farther, to apply for a Lord Chief Ju&s;tice's Warrant, to be &s;erved on the Aggre&s;&s;ors&mdash;I declin'd all Proceedings of this Sort; tho' I have an undoubted Right to the Protection of the Laws, equal with any of my fellow Subjects. I had Charity enough to con&s;ider this, as an incon&s;ide|rate Act of warm Blood, and more the Effect of Par|tiality to this artful Man, than any ill will to me; I imagined their cooler Rea&s;on would di&s;prove it, I be|lieved
<PB N="41" REF="40">
their Judgments would not repeat it, and I de|clared, without fre&s;h Occa&s;ion, never to di&s;turb any one about it; I have kept my Word.</P>
<P>But, to go on with you, Sir, Pray what were tho&s;e thou&s;and unfore&s;een Accidents that &s;o di&s;order'd your dear Mind, on the fatal Night you mention? Why have you not recited 'em? I call'd on you to do it in my Epi&s;tle to you. Did you not appear to every one very tranquil, till there was no great Hopes of a crouded Audience; &s;till your Philo&s;ophy prevailed, till it appear'd the Robe did not appear; that indeed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>inflam'd your noble Liver and made you rage;</HI>"</Q> well, but <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"on a &s;udden Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Behaviour, which be|fore was complai&s;ant, or rather meanly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive (a generous and grateful Expre&s;&s;ion, for my treating you all along, with more Breeding than you de&s;erv'd, or probably ever under&s;tood or practis'd) "was totally changed:"</Q> This A&s;&s;ertion every one, behind the Scenes that Night, can deny; I appeal to Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> and many others there, if I did not ad|vi&s;e you, like a Friend and a Gentleman, not to do an indi&s;creet uncivil Thing toward the Audience, let <HI>Phi|lips</HI> or any one be to blame;&mdash;and &s;o, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"on my or|dering the Curtain to be drawn up, you ru&s;h'd pre|cipitately on the Stage:"</Q> The&s;e Lies are as mon|&s;trous as the Father of 'em.

'Tis true, <HI>You,</HI> Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> agreed, they &s;hould have that Hou&s;e, not having received any Salary for three Weeks;&mdash;But, you propos'd to re|ceive the next for your &s;elf alone: And had taken care to &s;eize the be&s;t Receipt taken at <HI>your Playing</HI> (viz. the fir&s;t Night of <HI>Cato)</HI> which did not amount to forty Pounds.&mdash;Who then acted hone&s;tly, I, whocho&s;e not to di&s;mi&s;s the Audience, or you, who to the di&s;|appointment of the poor unpaid People, would have depriv'd 'em of the Receipt of that Hou&s;e, by a Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion?

<P>Well but, <HI>Tommy</HI> &s;ays, my Fame was de&s;ign'd on his Ruin; to prove it, he'll give an Account of his Beha|viour to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> &s;ince his Arrival in this King|dom&mdash;very pretty Rea&s;oning this, truly! <HI>How was your Behaviour to prove my De&s;ign?&mdash;</HI>Prithee, Boy, go to School again; learn to make Themes, and to mend your Manners.&mdash;Well, to proceed, <HI>Tommy</HI> will ask Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> a few Que&s;tions, which have no Analogy, nor are at all appo&s;ite to any Que&s;tion Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> has made <HI>Tommy;</HI> no, Sophi&s;ter <HI>Tommy,</HI> can't an&s;wer 'em:&mdash;Very well, Child, go on, I'll an&s;wer your Que&s;tions. They are as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 1. Is he (Mr. <HI>Cibber)</HI> not con&s;cious, that had it not been for me he could not have &s;et his Foot on any Stage in this Kingdom?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> How could I be con&s;cious I could not, with|out your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;et my foot on any Stage here, af|ter you had by Letter of Complement, invited me to one Theatre; and Mr. DESBRISAY, and other Gentle|men (Men of Worth and Honour) had, by Me&s;|&s;age, and Letter of Attorney granted to Mr. SWAN (who came to <HI>England</HI> on purpo&s;e) invited me to the other? Needs there more be &s;aid to this?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 2. Did I not qua&s;h a Cartel, which was &s;igned by the Managers of both Companies, under &s;evere Pe|nalties, to exclude him from acting on either Stage?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> How came <HI>your Power</HI> to qua&s;h a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <HI>Cartel</HI> was idly de&s;ign'd to exclude all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Actors from the Theatres here.</NOTE> Cartel? Or, <HI>who had a Right to make &s;uch Cartel?</HI> That Mr. <HI>Swan</HI> (he is ab&s;ent, therefore to be treated tenderly) drew one is certain; that &s;ome injudicious People &s;ign'd it, I believe: But &s;till, <HI>Aungier-&s;treet</HI> was open to re|ceive
<PB N="44" REF="43">
me&mdash;the &s;ame Terms proffer'd me,&mdash;nay, would I have engag'd alone, double the Terms, which I am now to get when I can. But, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s parti|cular Application, and Per&s;wa&s;ions, have drawn me into an Agreement I have but too much Rea&s;on to Re|pent.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 3. Did I not, as a Stranger, treat him with all civility, tho' the unhappy Character he labour'd under prevented my having any Friend&s;hip with him?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> And &s;o, thou, conde&s;cending Creature, did&s;t treat me with all Civility. And, pray, why &s;hould not you?&mdash;or could you &s;uppo&s;e, you would not hear of it, whenever you behav'd otherwi&s;e? I think you have, and I believe you will &s;till:&mdash;Oh! but my unhappy Character prevented your having any particular Friend&s;hip with me; I &s;hall always think it a happy Part of my Character, not to have been too far in|veigled by you; and a Happine&s;s in my Circum&s;tan|ces, that you have given me timely Warning, not to enter into any Intimacy, into which, my good-natur'd Credulity, and your wheedling Cunning, might have betray'd me: I have &s;uffered too much already, 'tis well known, by &s;uch Caitiffs.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4. Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr. <HI>Sloper</HI> and him, and the Letters which pa&s;&s;ed between him and his Wife, from being reprinted here &s;oon after his Arrival: And did I not commi&s;&s;ion a Friend to offer the Expence of the Impre&s;&s;ion, out of my own Pocket, rather than a Stranger &s;hould be hurt?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> You &s;ay, but we have only your bare Word for it (which is now in no great E&s;timation) you prevented the Trial between <HI>Sloper</HI> and me, being printed; I don't know you did, nor do I believe you did; and I am &s;ure, I don't care whether it's printed or no: Time, Truth, and undeniable Facts, have open'd the Eyes of Mankind, &s;o much, in my Behalf, on account of that unhappy Affair, that I have no far|ther Anxiety about it, nor dread any Imputation on my Honour, or Hone&s;ty thereby.&mdash;As to the Letters, between me, and my Wife, whenever they are read, all &s;en&s;ible impartial Readers will readily allow me to
<PB N="45" REF="44">
be, tho'a weak, an unfortunate Man; a hurt Lover, an injur'd Hu&s;band, and a Friend betray'd.&mdash;But, how dare you, thou un&s;peakable Wretch, mention my Wife,&mdash;or what would&s;t thou intimate? I defy my dire&s;t Enemy, who dares &s;peak Truth, to &s;ay, that ought ever happened between us, but what, too fatally, has prov'd me to be <Q>One, who lov'd not wi&s;ely, but too well!</Q></P>
<P>As to Mrs. CIBBER, I &s;hall only at pre&s;ent &s;ay of her, the Amendment of her Conduct, joined to her Merits as an Actre&s;s, having gained her the Good will of many, and re&s;tor'd her to the charitable Thoughts of a kind World, I will &s;corn (tho' wounded in the deepe&s;t Manner Human Nature can feel) ever to u&s;e any low Invectives again&s;t a Woman, or to ob&s;truct her future Quiet, or her Happine&s;s, unle&s;s (and I hope there will be no Occa&s;ion) &s;ome future Cau&s;e &s;hould call upon my Honour, as a Hu&s;band, to put that Power in force, which my Humanity would be &s;hock'd to be dri|ven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of executing.&mdash;But &s;ay, thou unnatural Thing, of Nothing, unknowing (as your neare&s;t Friends aver) either of the Joys, or Pains of Love, thou hateful Stranger to the Ties of Kindred, or real Joy of Social Friend&s;hip, what, but the mo&s;t ran|crous Heart of the <HI>mo&s;t ba&s;e, infamous Villain, and no|torious Poltroon,</HI> could have drawn this di&s;graceful Pa|ragraph, from the Gall of thy invidous Pen? Tho&s;e Epithets I many Times have us'd in mo&s;t publick Places, in publick Print, or <HI>viva voce,</HI> and ever &s;hall, join'd to the Name of <HI>Sloper:</HI> Nor will the Name of THOMAS SHERIDAN, henceforward, be ever menti|on'd by me, but the &s;ame Epithets will be heard or under&s;tood. That a Gentleman of Honour, in this City, did prevent the Re-publi&s;hing of the above-men|tion'd Letters, I have rea&s;on to believe, and mu&s;t think it de&s;ign'd as an Act of good Nature in him, as not willing either &s;hould be hurt:&mdash;But your &s;topping 'em I know nothing of, any more than I do of the Obligations, you would intimate, I have to you, unle&s;s you mean it an Obligation&mdash;that I have accidentally done you the favour to dine with you, when I might have pa&s;s'd my Time more agreeably in better Com|pany.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 5. Did I not promi&s;e him, to &s;tudy any new Character for his &s;econd Benefit? (A Favour which I had refu&s;ed to others much more worthy of it.)</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> You did promi&s;e to &s;tudy a Part for my Bene|fit, tho' I did not want you to do it; but you &s;ince &s;aid you'd play no more; and if you have refu&s;ed that mountainous Favour, as your own vain Imagination paints it, to worthier Per&s;ons, I think, as every one will, you were very much to blame.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 6. Did I not, when I found Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> tri|fling with him, and refu&s;ing to perform the Contract, before his Face declare, that I never would in any Shape be concern'd with Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> hereafter, if he did not pay him, nay more, offer'd to play with Mr. CIBBER in the other Hou&s;e; to try by that Means to make up his Lo&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7. Did not Mr. CIBBER &s;ay on that Occa&s;ion, that I behav'd with &s;uch Honour, and laid him under &s;uch Obligations, that he only wi&s;h'd for an Opportuni|ty to return them?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 6 <HI>and</HI> 7. When <HI>Philips</HI> trifled, and behaved ill enough (as he knows not how to behave well) you did talk of being concern'd no more with <HI>Philips,</HI> and of playing with me in another Hou&s;e (which you thought it would be your Intere&s;t to do) I made you &s;everal Com|pliments on that Account, which, on Reflection, were more than you de&s;erv'd, for a Propo&s;ition you had no Right to make, &s;ince you were then actually engaged with <HI>Philips,</HI> in Articles for &s;ome Time, &s;o could not keep your Word. And whenever you play, the Players too well know how much your own Intere&s;t will be con|&s;ider'd, before the Welfare of any one Per&s;on, or the Intere&s;t of the whole Body.</P>
<P>May one not rea&s;onably &s;ugge&s;t, you rather cho&s;e to play with me, that my good Nature, or good Manners (call it Indolence, if you will) might decline any Part you wi&s;h'd? And if the all-&s;ufficient <HI>Tommy</HI> held my Playing in Tragedy &s;o cheap, whence all the&s;e unnece&s;|&s;ary Cautions of his, again&s;t my playing in that Light? Or his Endeavours, before I appeared in the Kingdom, to imprint in the Minds of &s;ome People (the&s;e Things can be proved <HI>Tommy)</HI> my Incapacity for &s;uch Perfor|mance?
<PB N="47" REF="46">
Or whence his pre&s;ent Anger avow'd again&s;t any Attempts of Mine of that Sort? Indeed, Child, your Heat betrays you here; it out-runs your Cunning. And &s;o, your Name brought full Hou&s;es, when we play'd to empty Benches: The wor&s;t Hou&s;es I have &s;een here, were when you play'd; indeed, Youth, you &s;hould remember the Old Saying, <HI>Fibbers &s;hould have good Memories:</HI> Not one full Hou&s;e have I &s;een you Play to, &s;ince I came.&mdash;The fir&s;t Time I ever &s;aw you on the Stage, was in the Play of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> when the Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing your Brother, in <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> was what the Managers depended on for bringing the Audience: I was told there was then about 50<HI>l.&mdash;</HI>You play'd <HI>Lord Townly,</HI> for a Widows Benefit, to about 20<HI>l.

<HEAD>A Letter from a Young LADY to Mr. CIBBER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. CIBBER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE you will think this comes very late by Way of An&s;wer to a Paper you publi&s;h'd, dated 11th of <HI>July,</HI> entitled, <HI>A Proper Reply to a late &s;cur|rillous Libel,</HI> &amp;c. I have been in the Country for this good while pa&s;t, and heard nothing of your Quarrel with Mr. SHERIDAN till the Day before Ye&s;terday, when the a|bove-named Paper was put into my Hands, by a Gentle|man, who, at the &s;ame Time, related the Occa&s;ion of your Di&s;pute to me. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I fir&s;t ca&s;t my Eyes on your <HI>Reply,</HI> I imagined I &s;hould have been of your Party; but when I had read a few Pages of it. I own I changed my Mind, and began to &s;u&s;pect that the Gentleman had been a little partial in his Account.</P>
<P>You begin with letting the Publick know, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that to addre&s;s them in foul Language is an Affront to their Ears, and a Breach of good Manners."</Q>&mdash;A very hopeful Beginning.&mdash;And would not one im|agine, that a Gentleman who thought thus would write nothing contradictory to &s;uch an Opinion, but would, at lea&s;t, keep within the Bounds of common Decency in his Expre&s;&s;ions? Yes, certainly, and Mr. CIBBER is &s;o con&s;cious of the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of u&s;ing ill Language, that he mo&s;t religiou&s;ly avoids it, as I &s;hall take Notice of more at large pre&s;ently: In the mean while I &s;hall pro|ceed in Order to your &s;everal Paragraphs.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. <HI>Arne</HI> (&s;ay you) told me at the <HI>Rainbow</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e, that he had been ju&s;t talking with Mr. <HI>Faulkuer</HI> at the <HI>Globe</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e, who, among other Things, declared his Opinion, that it was indi&s;creet in Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> to cau&s;e or &s;uffer &s;uch Things to be publi&s;h'd, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;A <HI>Printer's Opinion!&mdash;</HI>Why, Man,
<PB N="56" REF="55">
if it was a Stadtholder's, you could not deliver it with more Solemnity; poor <HI>Faulkner</HI> is an hone&s;t Fellow, but for God's Sake don't talk of his <HI>Opinion!</HI></P>
<P>Well, in the next Place, you inform us <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. SHERIDAN &s;par'd no Money in Chair-hire, to alarm all Parts of the Town."</Q>&mdash;Why, this is not like <HI>London,</HI> Chair-hire is very cheap here, and you may go almo&s;t from one End to the other of our poor little City in an Hour's Time, and it won't co&s;t you Nineteen Pence; if you don't believe me, prithee, for once, make the Experi|ment.</P>
<P>Now, to come to your Promi&s;e of good Manners a|gain.&mdash;You &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you will contradict Mr. SHERIDAN by Facts, not by dirty Language."</Q>&mdash;Very good &s;till; I am in Hopes you will keep your Word; but we &s;hall &s;ee that pre&s;ently: In a few Lines after this you call him the <HI>Great Sheridan,</HI> and by and by <HI>Ma&s;ter Tommy;</HI> there is no Scurrillity in this, I grant you, but indeed, my Friend, there is a little Malice, and a little Childi&s;hne&s;s in it.&mdash;But, to come to a more material Place.&mdash;You a&s;k Mr. SHERIDAN, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why he did'nt recite tho&s;e thou&s;and unfore&s;een Accidents that di&s;order'd his dear mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Why, indeed Mr. SHERIDAN &s;hould, in Ju&s;|tice to him&s;elf, have been a little more explicit, with Re&s;pect to them Accidents, whatever they were; but is it not po&s;&s;ible (I &s;peak to you as a Man of common Sen&s;e now, and leave the Di&s;pute quite out of the Que&s;|tion) is it not very po&s;&s;ible that a Man may, by a hund|red little concurring Incidents (&s;o trivial in them&s;elves that they would &s;carce bear a Repetition, yet at the &s;ame time may make a great Impre&s;&s;ion on a delicate Mind) be really &s;o di&s;ordered that it would be actually impo&s;|&s;ible for him to exert him&s;elf properly at &s;ome particular Junctures? Certainly nothing is more true, In&s;tances of this Nature are &s;een frequently; and I knew a Lady who put off her Marriage Day, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the im|patient Bridegroom with all his Train, becau&s;e &s;he was di&s;appointed of her Wedding Slippers.&mdash;I think this is a parallel Ca&s;e with the one in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But to go on.&mdash;You &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you treated Mr. SHERIDAN with more good Breeding than he de&s;erved, or pro|bably
<PB N="57" REF="56">
ever under&s;tood or practi&s;ed."</Q> An admirable In|&s;tance of your good Breeding this, and a great Compli|ment to the College where Mr. SHERIDAN received his Education. Do you remember you are talking to a Gentleman, one who was born &s;uch, and educated &s;uch, and, it is to be pre&s;umed, conver&s;ed with none other, till the Narrowne&s;s of his Fortune reduced him to the &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity of being Company for the Gentry of the Stage. This Kingdom, I own, is much <HI>honour'd</HI> by your Pre&s;ence, and is likely, by your Means, to improve as much in good Breeding as it will in the Regulation of the Theatres. The Man of Manners is a Character I find you affect, and keep up notably; but really, till you undeceiv'd me, I always thought a <HI>Player's Polite|ne&s;s</HI> was much of a Size with a <HI>Printer's Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>You tell us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You offer'd to play <HI>Syphax</HI> and read <HI>Cato.</HI>"</Q> I will not call this an impudent and extravagant Propo&s;al, but I cannot help &s;aying, there &s;eems to be a good Deal of Art and De&s;ign in it: What could you propo&s;e by &s;uch an Offer? but to make Mr. SHERIDAN's Behaviour in refu&s;ing to act, appear in the wor&s;t Light, when oppo&s;ed to your kind Cande&s;cen&s;ion in taking up|on you to act two Parts (which was the Ca&s;e in Effect) when he totally refu&s;ed to appear in one. You knew the Audience mu&s;t have an ill Impre&s;&s;ion made on them for the pre&s;ent from &s;uch a Refu&s;al: You take them in the Mood, and, out of your great Affection to them, like an obliging Creature, chu&s;e the Fatigue of playing two Characters (a Thing perhaps not &s;o new to you) where that little, ob&s;tinate, perver&s;e Chit, SHERIDAN, wou'dn't, as I &s;aid before, play one.&mdash;Kind, indeed, but, between you and I, I &s;u&s;pect you in this plau&s;ible Intention, and am apt to believe, there was more Ill|nature than Complai&s;ance in it.</P>
<P>But come, you advance a-pace with your Court Breed|ing. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Good Nature, you &s;ay, was &s;hew'd you on this Occa&s;ion, you wonder didn't provoke Mr. SHERIDAN to publi&s;h his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Peo|ple, for the terrible Mortification, his little Pride, mean Vanity, poor Envy, and rancarous Heart, felt on this di&s;mal Account."</Q>&mdash;Now from Envy, Hatred, Malice, and all Uncharitablene&s;s, good Lord deliver us.
<PB N="58" REF="57">
Pray, how do you know that Mr. SHERIDAN was &s;o much mortify'd? Softly, or you will betray your&s;elf, and ea&s;ily di&s;cover that the Plea&s;ure you propos'd to your&s;elf in mortifying your Antagoni&s;t, was a Motive much more prevailing with your &s;ocial, humane Heart, to act as you did, than that of obliging your Audience;&mdash;is not this true?&mdash;Well, here you quote Mr. SHERIDAN's Expre&s;&s;ions, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Tommy</HI> (as you call him) &s;ays your Fame was de&s;ign'd on his Ruin, and to prove it, he will give an Account of his Behaviour to you &s;ince your Arrival in this Kingdom."</Q>&mdash;Very pretty Rea&s;oning this, &s;ay you, how was his Behaviour to prove my De&s;ign? This it &s;eems was a high Joke to you, but pray have a little Patience, had Mr. SHERI|DAN only related his own Conduct towards you, without mentioning any Part of your Behaviour with re&s;pect to him, I own that wou'd be a Method of proving a little new, it might indeed make the Ingratitude, or In&s;in|cerity of a Man, appear in blacker Colours, but that it could not prove his De&s;ign, mu&s;t be allowed; but if I don't mi&s;take Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> he gives us &s;ome Account of your Conduct as well as his own, but there was no need of that, the Town have been Witne&s;&s;es to it, and I think it is very obvious from what you have &s;aid, done, and wrote, that your Intentions were none of the mo&s;t charitable; your Behaviour in the Affair of <HI>Cato,</HI> prov'd your De&s;igns, and Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s Behaviour towards you, prov'd how little he de&s;erv'd &s;uch Treat|ment.&mdash;Where's the Ab&s;urdity of this?&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e it was thus, that every body (but your&s;elf) under|&s;tood Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> tho' perhaps he did not con&s;ider it &s;o di&s;tinctly&mdash;.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over that Part of your <HI>Reply</HI> which is by way of Dialogue between you and Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> be|cau&s;e there are &s;ome private Reflections in it, of a Na|ture too tender to be trifled with; but I long to come to the Place where you &s;hew your&s;elf the very Pink of Courte&s;ie, I mean where you &s;alute Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> by the Name of the mo&s;t ba&s;e, infamous Villain and noto|rious Poltroon.&mdash;Courteous and polite, I confe&s;s.&mdash;You told us, <Q REND="inline">"Fibbers &s;hould have good Memories."</Q>&mdash;So &s;hould Railers too. You &s;eem to forget, that <HI>all</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="58">
<HI>bad Expre&s;&s;ions retort upon the Slanderer.</HI> If you be|lieve this you have them for your Pains; but you &s;hould have con&s;idered this before you gave your Pen &s;uch a Liberty.</P>
<P>But I had like to have forgot your lofty Manner of addre&s;&s;ing him before this,&mdash;
<Q><L>But &s;ay, thou unnatural Thing of Nothing,</L>
<L>Unknowing (as your neare&s;t Friends aver)</L>
<L>Either of the Joys or Pains of Love,</L>
<L>Thou hateful Stranger to the Ties of Kindred,</L>
<L>Or real Joy of &s;ocial Friend&s;hip.</L></Q>
Very &s;ublime! I had &s;ome Thoughts of throwing it into Metre, but I was afraid it would lo&s;e its Dignity, and therefore cho&s;e to let it remain in Blank Ver&s;e. Pray who gave you this odd Character of Mr. <HI>Sheridan?</HI> I am his Country-Woman, have always liv'd in the &s;ame City with him, and have been acquainted with his Name for &s;ome Years, and yet I never heard that he had &s;uch a little adamantine Heart, as to be in&s;en&s;ible both to Love and Friend&s;hip; he has Kindred, who I have been inform'd are in &s;ome Mea&s;ure oblig'd to his Tenderne&s;s for their Support&mdash;I think this is not an Argument, that he has &s;o &s;avage a Brea&s;t as you wou'd intimate, &s;o that 'tis probable them near Friends you &s;peak of, have mi&s;inform'd you.</P>
<P>You give us to under&s;tand that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you have not &s;een Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> play to one full Hou&s;e &s;ince you came."</Q> I can't tell, indeed, what particular Fatality may have attended him &s;ince you came, but I know his Name (whatever Je&s;t you are plea&s;ed to make of it) &s;eldom fail'd to bring a numerous and polite Audience. Nor is it, let me tell you, over and above civil in you, to point out any particular Night, when, as you &s;ay, there was the very wor&s;t Audience that has been known a long Time; how do you know how many Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction and Merit might have been there? I pre|&s;ume you are not well enough acquainted here to a&s;&s;irm this upon your own Knowledge. Pray what do you call the wor&s;t Audience? Did you mean the thinne&s;t? If you did, you &s;hould have &s;aid &s;o, for the other Word, I think, affronts the whole Audience at once,
<PB N="60" REF="59">
be it good or bad: Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> him&s;elf didn't do wor&s;e than this.</P>
<P>You think proper to &s;peak with great Contempt of his Stile, and (as a competent Judge) at once pronounce it, non&s;en&s;ical, tautological, and inconnected; to be &s;ure you can never be guilty of any &s;uch notorious Faults; but pray let me a&s;h you a Que&s;tion: I mu&s;t fir&s;t make u&s;e of your own Words to Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hall not (&s;ay you) forfeit my Under&s;tanding &s;o much, as ever to hint you have the lea&s;t right to &s;tand in any Degree of Compari&s;on with Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> or Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> or with many more THERE."</Q> Where pray, Mr. <HI>Cibber?</HI> One would imagine by your Way of putting it, that <HI>Quin</HI> and <HI>Garrick</HI> were the Names of two Cities. But I &s;uppo&s;e you were dream|ing of <HI>London</HI> when you made this Mi&s;take, and indeed I believe you were &s;leepy when you wrote the whole.

<P>I thank my Stars I am come to your lo&s;t Page, but there is an Expre&s;&s;ion here that &s;tops me &s;hort, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mu&s;t I be frightened becau&s;e a Spalpeen &s;tares?"</Q> What do you take a Spalpeen to be, Mr. <HI>Cibber?</HI> a Bear, may be, or a Bug-a-bow; I believe you are not rightly apprized of the Sen&s;e of the Word, and yet it may be properly enough applied to a Player; they are People who labour in one Sea&s;on, and are Beggars in the other; that is all.</P>
<P>But it's Time to take my Leave of you, which I &s;hall do anon, tho' the Flying Stationers don't pre&s;s me to a Conclu&s;ion as they did you; but indeed, I am afraid you had to do with great Knaves, for they would make you believe, that if you encrea&s;ed the Bulk of your Paper, they could not afford it for a Penny, but let me tell you as a Friend, that, in &s;o cheap a Country as <HI>Ireland,</HI> they cou'd afford ten times as much of the &s;ame Wit for half the Price.</P>

To prove this, he mentions Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI>'s telling him his Opinion, That it would be better not to have them printed: I grant it may be nothing to the Publick, what was <HI>Faulkner</HI>'s Opinion; but it proves, that Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> knew <HI>She|ridan</HI> to be &s;o much intere&s;ted in the Adverti&s;ements, that he thought his Re&s;olution alone nece&s;&s;ary, as to the put|ting them in or leaving them out; and <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s An|&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> accordingly, was, <Q REND="inline">"I AM DETER|MINED:"</Q> Yet a&s;terwards, frontle&s;s <HI>Sheridan,</HI> in his &s;illy Addre&s;s, &s;olemnly declares, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was all without his Knowledge."</Q>&mdash;matchle&s;s Impudence!<HI>&mdash;Tommy</HI> cannot an&s;wer this, nor has attempted it.</P>
<P><HI>Cibber</HI> &s;urther charges <HI>Sheridan,</HI> that he him&s;elf car|ried the other Adverti&s;ement to <HI>Faulkner</HI>'s, where it was refu&s;ed; that he him&s;elf altered the Word <HI>Butchers</HI> to <HI>Ruffians,</HI> and afterwards him&s;elf carried it to <HI>Reilly</HI>'s; and in which, as you may &s;ee, he him&s;elf declares, That He him&s;elf is innocent of the former Adverti&s;ements or Letters, and knew nothing at all of the Matter. This is a Truth Mr. <HI>Faulkner,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Reilly,</HI> and other living Witne&s;&s;es can prove.</P>
<P>Thus then &s;tands the Fact,&mdash;Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> di&s;ap|pointed, either at not having a particular Robe, or at the thinne&s;s of the Audience, or, perhaps, de&s;irous to indulge his Vanity in making an Audience be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, though Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Giffard</HI> were in the Play, (who by that Means were to be thought o&s; no Con&s;e|quence) or from <HI>Tommy</HI>'s unea&s;y delicate Mind, He did not chu&s;e there &s;hould be any Play, then &s;ays, it was ungrateful and in&s;incere in any Man to attempt any Character he had play'd: Thus he forms wild Ideas in his Noddle, of his being injured; &s;ets a Man up as an imaginary Enemy; cruelly per&s;ecutes him; and endea|vours,
<PB N="64" REF="63">
by Means the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable to Society (no le&s;s than the endangering of Lives) to hinder any one from doing what <HI>Tommy,</HI> through Spleen, Pique, Pride and Impertinence, would not do him&s;elf.</P>
<P>By &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in your Letter, Mi&s;s, I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect <HI>Tommy</HI> has gone farther in the Character of <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Petulant,</HI> which <HI>Cibber</HI> mentions in his fir&s;t Letter;&mdash;I que&s;tion whether <HI>Tommy,</HI> like <HI>Petulant,</HI> be&s;ides having wrote to him&s;elf, has not put on a Hood, Mask and Scarf, and called for him&s;elf; po&s;itively, it looks mighty like it. I prote&s;t I'll not forgive it, if like <HI>Slender</HI> in the Play, I am to be deceived, and in|&s;tead of &s;weet <HI>Mrs. Anne Page,</HI> am to be put upon by a great <HI>lubberly Boy.&mdash;</HI>I hear, when <HI>Cibber</HI> read your Letter, he bur&s;t into a loud Laugh, and cried, <HI>Stap my Vitals,</HI> Tam <HI>again!</HI> then added, with the com|pos'd Serenity of Lord <HI>Foppington,</HI> Tam <HI>is the impudente&s;t Fellow that Nature ever &s;pawn'd into the World, &s;trike me &s;peechle&s;s!&mdash;</HI>Did <HI>Cibber</HI> gue&s;s right, or how, dear Creature?</P>
<P>But pray, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> why did you give your&s;elf the needle&s;s Trouble of telling <HI>Cibber</HI> the Price of Chair|hire here? Sure you can't but &s;uppo&s;e he has been idly indolent enough to have rode in one &s;everal times here, as he frequently u&s;ed in <HI>London,</HI> when your Cou|&s;in <HI>Tommy</HI> found it much more convenient to walk on foot; when <HI>Tommy</HI> was not plagued with the Incum|brance of a Chair, a Hor&s;e, a Footman, or any other impertinent Equipage, nor knew the Fatigue of being levee'd by Wine-merchants, Trade&s;men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which his late Luck made him unexpectedly acquainted with.</P>
<P>That <HI>Cibber</HI> calls <HI>Tommy</HI> the <HI>great Sheridan,</HI> and af|terwards <HI>Ma&s;ter Tommy,</HI> is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent; &s;ince all the World mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, the fir&s;t can be but Irony. Had <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Sheridan</HI> was brave, ju&s;t, witty, ge|nerous, hand&s;ome, genteel, polite, a pretty Fellow, a compleat Gentleman, or an excellent Actor, would any one have &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Cibber</HI> in earne&s;t?&mdash;To be &s;ure, my Dear, you know they could not.&mdash;I again que&s;tion whe|ther <HI>Tommy,</HI> not caring to &s;hew his Face like a Man, has not hid him&s;elf under a Petticoat.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64">
You own, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> Tommy <HI>&s;hould, in Ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, have been a little more explicit, with regard to them Accidents,&mdash;</HI>A little more explicit!&mdash;why, he has &s;aid nothing at all, but that he had not his fine Play-things: As childi&s;h a Rea&s;on as we, when we wore Bibs and Aprons, ever gave for not eating our Bread and Butter, when, per|haps, it wanted Gla&s;s Windows upon it, or becau&s;e our Dolls were not dre&s;&s;ed to our Minds. But I wi&s;h, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> you had let us into a few, or any one, of tho&s;e <HI>little concurring trifling Incidents, that made &s;o great an Im|pre&s;&s;ion on the delicate Mind of the dainty Deary, as</HI> RENDR'D HIM INCAPABLE AT A PARTICULAR JUNCTURE. Oh! the critical Minute! how has <HI>Tommy</HI> lo&s;t it! Oh Ged! I wi&s;h he may ever get over it! Well, I vow, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> you brought all the Blood of my Body into my Face; you wicked Creature! You gauky Romp! You wild Toad! How can you give one &s;uch comical naughty Ideas?</P>
<P>Well, that Parallel of the Lady di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her im|patient Bridegroom, for want of her Slippers, is apt enough, and was very near as ridiculous as di&s;appointing an Audience for want of a particular Robe: 'Twas a dangerous Trial of the Bridegroom's Love; Did he ever return to the Lady?&mdash;And, was the Lady as hand|&s;ome as pretty <HI>Tommy?&mdash;</HI>Sure <HI>Tommy</HI> wou'dn't di&s;ap|point a Bride for want of white Gloves and a lac'd Nightcap.</P>
<P>But, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> why do you lug the College into your Epi&s;tle? (that's &s;o like <HI>Tommy)</HI> What Reflection is it on them, that <HI>Tommy</HI> does not under&s;tand good Breeding? I have heard of a Par&s;on's being hang'd, and a Soldier's being drumm'd out of a Regiment, yet neither brought any Reflection on the Gown or the Army. Though you and I are two prate-a-pace Bag|gages, does it follow, none of our Sex know when to hold their Tongues? But of what Con&s;equence is it to the Publick, whether <HI>Cibber</HI> is a Gentleman by Birth, or whether any of <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s Relations were ever tran&s;ported, or made their Exits at the tripple Tree? But &s;ure <HI>Tommy</HI> won't pretend to &s;ay he acted like a Gentleman, when he did all he could to &s;et the whole Town in a Blaze, and laid Schemes for very fatal Con|&s;equences;
<PB N="66" REF="65">

<P>Well, your playing upon the <HI>Players Politene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Printer</HI>'s <HI>Opinion,</HI> is <HI>prodigious plea&s;ant and pretty, I pro|te&s;t;</HI> ah! how the <HI>P</HI>'s come in there!<HI>&mdash;P upon P,</HI> or <HI>Pay upon Pay,</HI> as <HI>Bays</HI> &s;ays, as good as ever was wrote.</P>
<P>What were <HI>Cibber</HI>'s real Motives for reading <HI>Cato,</HI> and playing <HI>Syphax,</HI> I won't pretend to determine, any more than you, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> or your Cou&s;in <HI>Tommy,</HI> ought;&mdash;that it was fatiguing, is certain,&mdash;that it requir'd &s;ome Art, as an Actor, I &s;uppo&s;e,&mdash;that it prevented the Audience from being di&s;appointed thro' <HI>Tommy</HI>'s Vanity and Caprice, is undeniable,&mdash;who one may rea&s;onably &s;ugge&s;t wi&s;h'd, as there was not a great Audience, to di&s;mi&s;s them, that it might be &s;aid, there could be no Play without <HI>Tommy.</HI> Why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e any ill-natur'd De&s;ign in Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Offer, of giving him&s;elf &s;o much Trouble? 'Twas al|low'd by the Audience, an Act of Complai&s;ance; they thought he acquitted him&s;elf well: And their repeated Applau&s;es &s;hew'd their Opinion.&mdash;Now, as I told you, Mi&s;s, I have &s;een Plays often in <HI>London,</HI> I &s;hall farther inform you, I have heard it &s;aid there, that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> has frequently manag'd a Theatre with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that both the Town and the Players have been well pleas'd: Nay, I have heard it allow'd, no Actor better knows how to conduct a Theatre than he does:&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, he did not come hither to learn that Art, if there is any in it.&mdash;Nor can any of the Directors, here, boa&s;t much of the regular Conduct of their Play-hou&s;es, I believe.&mdash;</P>
<P>I vow, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> I mu&s;t chide you, for taking the L&mdash;d's Name in vain, and making &s;o free with any

<P>You &s;ay, if you don't mi&s;take Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> he gives &s;ome Account of Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Conduct, as well as his own.&mdash;Why, my Dear, you do mi&s;take; he gives no account:&mdash;I allow with you, all <HI>Tommy</HI> could &s;ay were needle&s;s,&mdash;for the Town will always judge for them&s;elves.&mdash;That <HI>Cibber</HI> has join'd the Words, ba&s;e, infamous Villain, and notorious Poltroon, to <HI>Tommy Sheridan</HI>'s Name, is undeniable; and, after <HI>Tommy</HI> had impudently, and impertinently, mention'd Family Di&s;tre&s;&s;es (quite foreign to the Purpo&s;e) what le&s;s could <HI>Tommy</HI> expect? or what Gentleman or Lady, will be offended with Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> for be&s;towing &s;uch Appel|lations on <HI>Tommy,</HI> after &s;o ju&s;t a Provocation? Why does not <HI>Tommy</HI> &s;hake 'em off? 'Tis his own Fault if they &s;tick upon him&mdash;But has he not dealt as freely with him&s;elf, in the third Paragraph of his own Letter? Does he not there under his own Hand, in a publick manner, prove him&s;elf an unfit Companion for any Gentleman whatever.</P>
<P>Bad Expre&s;&s;ions certainly retort upon the Slanderer, but when the Per&s;on pointed at de&s;erves tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;i|ons (which I don't hear any one deny but that <HI>Tommy</HI> did) they'll remain where they are plac'd; and are only bold Truths, not Slander.&mdash;As you grow critical, Mi&s;s <HI>Tabby,</HI> on <HI>Cibber</HI>'s lofty and &s;ublime manner of addre&s;&s;ing <HI>Tommy;</HI> give me leave to &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>Cibber</HI> might grow a little warm, on &s;o nice a Point as the mention of a Woman; The Occa&s;ion appears ju&s;t enough, and 'tis excu&s;able, if his Stile &s;wells a little: If you, or I, were in a Pa&s;&s;ion, 'tis po&s;&s;ible we might elevate our Dialect, as well as rai&s;e our Voices.</P>

<P>Well, I vow and prote&s;t, Mi&s;s, that was comically thought of you, to find out, calling a thin Audience a bad Audience, was an Affront;&mdash;but I believe, you'll not ea&s;ily per&s;uade the Undertakers of any Play-hou&s;e, to think a thin Audience agood one:&mdash;Nor would any half dozen Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Di&s;tinction, or Merit, be angry at the Expre&s;&s;ion, if they were the only Specta|tors. I have &s;een the royal Family at an Opera in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o thin a Hou&s;e, the few that were there, all allow'd it to be a very bad Audience, and not one thought them&s;elves affronted by the Declaration.</P>
<P>Why, as you &s;ay, <HI>Cibber</HI> does find Fault (and pretty ju&s;tly I believe) with <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s Stile, and calls it, pro|perly enough, non&s;en&s;ical and tautological; and adds, his Matter is inconnected, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>When <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;ays, the Theatres in <HI>England</HI> are &s;ome|what better conducted than the Play-hou&s;es here, I don't &s;uppo&s;e he means a Compliment either to <HI>Sheridan,</HI> or the Managers.

<P>That <HI>Cibber</HI> knew what the Word <HI>Spalpeen</HI> meant, is pretty certain, by his applying it to <HI>Sheridan;</HI> and your Explanation of it fully &s;hews, Mi&s;s, that it fits <HI>Tommy</HI> very well: How near he was to being a <HI>Beggar,</HI> 'till he labour'd, la&s;t Sea&s;on, in his Vocation, as a Player, is pretty notorious.</P>
