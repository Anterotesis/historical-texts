<HEAD>THE LATE <HI>Tryal</HI> and <HI>Conviction</HI> OF Count <HI>TARIFF.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE whole Nation is at pre|&s;ent very inqui&s;itive after the Proceedings in the Cau&s;e of Goodman <HI>Fact,</HI> Plaintiff, and Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> Defendant; as it was Tried on the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> in the Thirteenth Year of Her Maje&s;ty's Reign, and in the Year of the Lord 1713. I

&s;hall therefore give my Countrymen a &s;hort and faithful Account of that whole Matter. And in order to it, mu&s;t in the fir&s;t Place premi&s;e &s;ome Particulars relating to the Per&s;on and Character of the &s;aid Plaintiff Good|man <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P>Goodman <HI>Fact</HI> is allowed by eve|ry Body to be a plain-&s;poken Per|&s;on, and a Man of very few Words. Tropes and Figures are his Aver&s;ion. He affirms every Thing roundly, without any Art, Rhetorick, or Cir|cumlocution. He is a declared Ene|my to all Kinds of Ceremony and Complai&s;ance. He flatters no Body. Yet &s;o great is his natural Eloquence, that he cuts down the fine&s;t Orator, and de&s;troys the be&s;t-contrived Argu|ment, as &s;oon as ever he gets him&s;elf to be heard. He never applies to the Pa&s;&s;ions or Prejudices of his Au|dience: When they li&s;ten with At|tention
<PB N="3" REF="5">
and hone&s;t Minds, he never fails of carrying his Point. He ap|pear'd in a Suit of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Broad-Cloath, very Plain, but Rich. Every thing he wore was &s;ub&s;tantial, hone&s;t, home-&s;pun Ware. His Cane indeed came from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and two or three little Superfluities from <HI>Turkey,</HI> and other Parts. It is &s;aid that he encouraged him&s;elf with a Bottle of Neat <HI>Port,</HI> before he ap|pear'd at the Tryal. He was Huz|za'd into the Court by &s;everal Thou|&s;ands of <HI>Weavers, Clothiers, Fullers, Dyers, Packers, Calenders, Setters, Silk-men, Spinners, Dre&s;&s;ers, Whit|&s;ters, Winders, Mercers, Throw&s;ters, Sugar-Bakers, Di&s;tillers, Drapers, Ho&s;iers, Planters, Merchants,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hermen;</HI> who all unanimou&s;ly de|clared that they cou'd not live above Two Months longer, if their Friend <HI>Fact</HI> did not gain his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
Every Body was over-joy'd to hear that the Good Man was come to Town. He no &s;ooner made his Ap|pearance in Court, but &s;everal of his Friends fell a weeping at the Sight of him: For indeed he had not been &s;een there &s;ome Years before.</P>
<P>The Charge he exhibited again&s;t Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was drawn up in the following Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the &s;aid Count had given in fal&s;e and fraudulent Reports in the Name of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the &s;aid Count had tam|per'd with the &s;aid Plaintiff, and made U&s;e of many indirect Me|thods to bring him over to his Party.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="7">
3. That the &s;aid Count had wil|fully and knowingly traduced the &s;aid Plaintiff, having mi&s;repre&s;ented him in many cunningly-devi&s;ed Speeches, as a Per&s;on in the <HI>French</HI> In|tere&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the &s;aid Count had aver|red in the Pre&s;ence of above Five hundred Per&s;ons, that he had heard the Plaintiff &s;peak in Derogation of the <HI>Portugue&s;e, Spaniards, Italians, Hollanders,</HI> and others; who were the Per&s;ons whom the &s;aid Plaintiff had always favoured in his Di&s;|cour&s;e, and whom he &s;hould always continue to Favour.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the &s;aid Count had given a very di&s;advantageous Relation of Three Great Farms, which had long flouri&s;hed under the Care and Su|perintendency of the Plaintiff.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="6" REF="8">
6. That he would have obliged the Owners of the &s;aid Farms to buy up many Commodities which grew upon their own Lands. That he would have taken away the Labour from the Tenants, and put it into the Hands of Strangers. That he wou'd have le&s;&s;en'd and de&s;troy'd the Produce of the &s;aid Farms.</P>
<P>That by the&s;e and many other wicked Devices he wou'd have &s;tar|ved many hone&s;t Day-Labourers; have impoveri&s;h'd the Owner, and have fill'd his Farms with Beggars, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the &s;aid Count had either Sunk or Mi&s;laid &s;everal Books, Pa|pers, and Receipts, by which the Plaintiff might &s;ooner have found Means to vindicate him&s;elf from
<PB N="7" REF="9">
&s;uch Calumnies, A&s;per&s;ions, and Mi&s;|repre&s;entations.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Particulars Goodman <HI>Fact</HI> was very Short but Pithy: For as I &s;aid before, he was a plain home-&s;pun Man. His Yea was Yea, and his Nay, Nay. He had further &s;o much of the Quaker in him, that he never &s;wore, but his Affirmation was as Valid as another's Oath.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved that Count <HI>Ta|riff</HI> endeavour'd to brow-beat the Plaintiff all the while he was &s;peak|ing: But though he was not &s;o Im|pudent as the Count, he was every whit as Sturdy; and when it came to the Count's Turn to &s;peak, Old <HI>Fact</HI> &s;o &s;tared him in the Face, after his plain, down-right Way, that the Count was very often &s;truck Dumb,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
and forced to hold his Tongue, in the middle of his Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>More Witne&s;&s;es appeared on this Occa&s;ion to atte&s;t Goodman <HI>Fact</HI>'s Veracity than ever were &s;een in a Court of Ju&s;tice. His Cau&s;e was pleaded by the Able&s;t Men in the Kingdom; among whom was a Gen|tleman of <HI>Suffolk</HI> who did him Signal Service.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Tariff</HI> appeared ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of Goodman <HI>Fact.</HI> He was dre&s;s'd in a Fine Brocade Wa&s;tcoat, curiou&s;ly Embroider'd with Flower-de-Luces. He wore al&s;o a broad-brimm'd Hat, a Shoul|der-Knot, and a Pair of Silver|clock'd Stockins. His Speeches were accompanied with much Ge|&s;ture and Grimace. He abounded in empty Phra&s;es, &s;uperficial Flou|ri&s;hes,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
violent A&s;&s;ertions, and fee|ble Proofs. To be brief, he had all the <HI>French</HI> A&s;&s;urance, Cun|ning, and Volubility of Tongue; and wou'd mo&s;t certainly have carried his Cau&s;e, had he dealt with any one Antagoni&s;t in the World be&s;ides Goodman <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P>The Count being call'd upon to An&s;wer to the Charge which had been made again&s;t him, did it after a Manner peculiar to the Family of the <HI>Tariffs,</HI> viz. by Railing and calling Names.</P>
<P>He in the Fir&s;t Place accu&s;ed his Adver&s;ary of <HI>Scandalum magnatum,</HI> and of &s;peaking again&s;t his Superi|ors with Saucine&s;s and Contempt. As the Plain Good Man was not of a Make to have any Friends at Court, he was a little &s;tartled at this Accu|&s;ation, till at length he made it ap|pear,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any of his Family to be either Saucy or Cringing; for that their Character was above all others in the World, to do what was required of them by the Court, that is, TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.</P>
<P>The Count in the next Place a&s;&s;u|red the Court, that his Antagoni&s;t has taken upon him a wrong Name, ha|ving curtail'd it of Two or Three Letters; for that in Reality his Name was not FACT but FACTION. The Count was &s;o plea&s;ed with this Con|ceit, that for an Hour together he re|peated it in every Sentence; calling his Antagoni&s;t's A&s;&s;ertions, the Re|ports of Faction; his Friends, the Sons of Faction; the Te&s;timonies of his Witne&s;&s;es, the Dictates of Faction: Nay, with &s;uch a Degree of Impu|dence did he pu&s;h this Matter, that
<PB N="11" REF="13">
when he heard the Cries of above a Million of People begging for their Bread, He termed the Prayers and Importunities of &s;uch a &s;tarving Mul|titude the CLAMOURS OF FACTION.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Count was driven out of this Device, he affirmed round|ly in the Court that FACT was not an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> by Birth, but that he was of <HI>Dutch</HI> Extraction, and born in <HI>Holland.</HI> In con&s;equence of this A&s;&s;ertion he began to rally the poor Plaintiff, under the Title of MYN HEER VAN FACT; which took pret|ty well with the Simpletons of his Party, but the Men of Sen&s;e did not think the Je&s;t worth all their Lands and Tenements.</P>
<P>When the Count had fini&s;hed his Speech, he de&s;ired leave to call in his Witne&s;&s;es, which was granted: When
<PB N="12" REF="14">
immediately there came to the Bar a Man with a Hat drawn over his Eyes in &s;uch a manner that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to &s;ee his Face. He &s;poke in the Spirit, nay in the very Language of the Count, repeated his Arguments, and confirmed his A&s;&s;ertions. Being ask'd his Name? He &s;aid the World called him MERCATOR: But as for his true Name, his Age, his Lineage, his Religion, his Place of Abode, they were Particulars, which for cer|tain Rea&s;ons he was obliged to con|ceal. The Court found him &s;uch a Fal&s;e, Shuffling, Prevaricating Ra&s;|cal, that they &s;et him a&s;ide as a Per&s;on unqualify'd to give his Te|&s;timony in a Court of Ju&s;tice; advi|&s;ing him at the &s;ame time, as he tender'd his Ears, to forbear utter|ing &s;uch notorious Fal&s;hoods as he had then Publi&s;hed. The Witne&s;s however per&s;i&s;ted in his Contumacy, telling them he was very &s;orry to
<PB N="13" REF="15">
find, that notwith&s;tanding what he had &s;aid, they were re&s;olved to be as arrant Fools as all their Forefathers had been for a Hundred Years be|fore them.</P>
<P>There came up another Witne&s;s, who &s;poke much to the Reputation of Count <HI>Tariff.</HI> This was a Tall, Black, Blu&s;tering Per&s;on, dre&s;&s;ed in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Habit, with a Plume of Feathers on his Head, a <HI>Golillio</HI> about his Neck, and a long <HI>Toledo</HI> &s;ticking out by his Side: His Gar|ments were &s;o cover'd with Tin&s;el and Spangles, that at a di&s;tance he &s;eem'd to be made up of Silver and Gold. He call'd him&s;elf DON ASSIENTO, and mentioned &s;eve|ral Nations that had &s;ought his Friend&s;hip; but declared that he had been gained over by the Count; and that he was come into the&s;e Parts
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to enrich every one that heard him. The Court was at fir&s;t very well plea&s;ed with his Figure, and the Promi&s;es he made them; but upon Examination found him a True <HI>Spa|niard:</HI> Nothing but Show and Beg|gary. For it was fully proved, that notwith&s;tanding the Boa&s;ts and Ap|pearance which he made, he was not worth a Groat: Nay, that upon ca&s;t|ing up his Annual Expences, with the Debts and Incumbrances which lay upon his E&s;tate, he was wor&s;e than Nothing.</P>
<P>There appear'd another Witne&s;s in favour of the Count, who &s;poke with &s;o much Violence and Warmth, that the Court begun to li&s;ten to him ve|ry attentively; till upon hearing his Name they found he was a notorious Knight of the Po&s;t, being kept in Pay, to give his Te&s;timony on all
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Occa&s;ions where it was wanted. This was the EXAMINER; A Per&s;on who had abu&s;ed almo&s;t every Man in <HI>England,</HI> that de&s;erved well of his Country. He called Goodman <HI>Fact</HI> a Lyar, a Seditious Per&s;on, a Tray|tor, and a Rebel; and indeed &s;o much incens'd the Hone&s;t Man, that he would certainly have knock'd him down if he could have come at him. It was allowed by every Body, that &s;o foul-mouth'd a Witne&s;s never ap|peared in any Cau&s;e. Seeing &s;everal Per&s;ons of great Eminence, who had maintained the Cau&s;e of Goodman <HI>Fact,</HI> he called them Ideots, Block|heads, Villains, Knaves, Infidels, Athei&s;ts, Apo&s;tates, Fiends, and De|vils: Never did Man &s;how &s;o much Eloquence in Ribaldry. The Court was at length &s;o ju&s;tly provok'd with this Fellow's Behaviour, who &s;pared no Age, nor Sex, nor Profe&s;&s;ion, which had &s;hown any Friend&s;hip or
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Inclination for the Plaintiff, that &s;e|veral began to Whi&s;per to one a|nother, it was high time to bring him to Puni&s;hment. But the Wit|ne&s;s over-hearing the Word <HI>Pillory</HI> repeated twice or thrice, &s;lunk away privately, and hid him&s;elf among the People.</P>
<P>After a full Hearing on both Sides, Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was Ca&s;t, and Goodman <HI>Fact</HI> got his Cau&s;e; but the Court &s;itting late, did not think it fit at that time to give him Co&s;ts, or indeed, to enter into that Mat|ter. The Hone&s;t Man immediate|ly retired, after having a&s;&s;ured his Friends, That at any time when the Count &s;hou'd appear on the like Occa&s;ion, he would undertake their Defence, and come to their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, if they would be at the Pains to find him out.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
It is incredible, how general a Joy Goodman <HI>Fact</HI>'s Succe&s;s crea|ted in the City of <HI>London;</HI> there was nothing to be &s;een or heard the next Day, but &s;haking of Hands, Congratulations, Reflections on the Danger they had e&s;cap'd; and Gra|titude to tho&s;e who had delivered them from it.</P>
<P>The Night concluded with Balls, Bonfires, Ringing of Bells, and the like Publick Demon&s;trations of Joy.</P>
