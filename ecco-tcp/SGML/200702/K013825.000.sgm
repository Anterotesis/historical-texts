<L>The Guns with fruitle&s;s Force <HI>in Noi&s;e</HI> complain.</L>
<L>See how the Troops intrepidly fall on!</L>
<L>Wi&s;h for more Foes, and think they fly too &s;oon,</L>
<L>With eager Fury to their Forts pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>And think the odds of Four to One too few.</L>
<L><HI>The Land's fir&s;t Conquer'd,</HI> and the Prize attends;</L>
<L>Fate beckens in the Fleet to back their Friends:</L>
<L>De&s;pair &s;ucceeds, they &s;truggle now too late,</L>
<L>And &s;oon &s;ubmit to their prevailing Fate:</L>
<L>Courage is Madne&s;s when Occa&s;ion's pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Death's the &s;ecure&s;t Refuge, and the la&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the rolling Flames come threatning on,</L>
<L>And mighty Streams of melted Gold run down.</L>
<L>The flaming Oar down to its Center makes,</L>
<L>To Form new Mines beneath the Oazy Lakes,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here a Galleon with Spicy Drugs enflam'd,</L>
<L>In Odoriferous folds of Sulphur &s;tream'd.</L>
<L>The Gods of Old no &s;uch Oblations knew,</L>
<L>Their Spices weak, and their Perfumes but few.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13">The frighted <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their Trea&s;ure fly,</L>
<L>Loth to for&s;ake their Wealth, <HI>but loth to Die.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here a va&s;t Carrack flies while none pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Bulg'd on the Shore by her Di&s;tracted Crew:</L>
<L>There like a mighty Mountain &s;he appears,</L>
<L>And groans beneath the Golden Weight &s;he bears.</L>
<L>Conque&s;t perverts the Property of Friend,</L>
<L>And makes Men Ruin what they can't Defend:</L>
<L>Some blow their Trea&s;ure up into the Air,</L>
<L>With all the wild Exce&s;&s;es of De&s;pair.</L>
<L>Strange Fate! that War &s;uch odd Events &s;hou'd have;</L>
<L>Friends would de&s;troy, and Enemies would &s;ave:</L>
<L>Others their Safety to their Wealth Prefer,</L>
<L>And mix <HI>&s;ome &s;mall Di&s;cretion</HI> with their Fear.</L>
<L>Life's the be&s;t Gift that Nature can be&s;tow;</L>
<L>The fir&s;t that we receive, the la&s;t which we forego:</L>
<L>And he that's <HI>vainly Prodigal of Blood,</HI></L>
<L>Forfeits his Sen&s;e to do his Cau&s;e no good.</L>
<L>All De&s;paration's the Effect of Fear;</L>
<L>Courage is Temper, Valour can't De&s;pair:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Victory's compleatly gain'd;</L>
<L>No Ships to Conquer now, no Foes remain'd.</L>
<L>The mighty Spoils exceed whate'er was known,</L>
<L>That Vanqui&s;h'd ever lo&s;t, or Victor won:</L>
<L>So great, if Fame &s;hall Future Times remind,</L>
<L>They'll think &s;he Lies, and Libels all Mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well may the Pious Queen New Anthems rai&s;e,</L>
<L>Sing her own Fortunes, and Her Maker's Prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Invite the Nation willing Thanks to pay;</L>
<L>And well may all the Mighty Ones Obey.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14">So may they &s;ing, be always &s;o pre&s;erv'd,</L>
<L>By Grace unwi&s;h'd, and Conque&s;t unde&s;erv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now let us Welcome Home the Conquering Fleet,</L>
<L>And all their well aton'd Mi&s;takes forget:</L>
<L>Such high Succe&s;s &s;hou'd all Re&s;entments drown'd,</L>
<L>Nothing but Joy and Welcome &s;hould be found.</L>
<L>No more their pa&s;t Mi&s;cariages Reprove,</L>
<L>But bury all in Gratitude and Love;</L>
<L>Let their high Conduct have a ju&s;t Regard,</L>
<L>And meaner Merit meet a kind Reward.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now what Fruits of Victory remain?</L>
<L>To Heaven what Prai&s;e? What Gratitude to Man?</L>
<L>Let <HI>France</HI> &s;ing Prai&s;e for Shams of Victories,</L>
<L>And Mock their Maker with Religious Lies:</L>
<L>But <HI>England</HI> ble&s;t with thankful Hearts &s;hall rai&s;e,</L>
<L>For mighty Conque&s;ts, mighty Songs of Prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She needs no fal&s;e Pretences to Deceive:</L>
<L>What all Men &s;ee, all Men mu&s;t needs believe.</L>
<L>Our Joy can hardly run into Exce&s;s,</L>
<L>The well known Subject all our Foes confe&s;s:</L>
<L>We can't de&s;ire more, they can't pretend to le&s;s.</L>
</LG>

<L><HI>ANNE,</HI> like her Great Progenitor, &s;ings Prai&s;e:</L>
<L>Like her &s;he Conquers, and like her &s;he Prays;</L>
<L>Like her &s;he Graces and Protects the Throne,</L>
<L>And counts the Lands Pro&s;perity her own:</L>

<L>See now the Royal Chariot comes amain,</L>
<L>With all the willing Nation in her Train,</L>
