<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor's chief intention in making the following Collection was to bring into one point of view the be&s;t pieces which have appeared &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of Dod&s;ley's collection; and he will venture to affirm, that whatever be the merit of that entertaining mi&s;cel|lany, this does not fall &s;hort any ways of it, as &s;ome of the volumes in that are made up from the publications of a few years; whereas this contains whatever has been mo&s;t applauded in a cour&s;e of twenty. But he has not con|fined him&s;elf to that period only, but in&s;erted many pieces, in his opinion, of great merit, which the inattention of the public, or the ob&s;curity of the publication, had long &s;uffered to remain unnoticed. To the&s;e are added many originals by writers of acknowledged merit; among which tho&s;e of Mr. Mendez, author of the Chaplet, and &s;everal admired poems in Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellany, make no mean figure. Mr. Mendez was reckoned among the mo&s;t agreeable poets of his time, and, perhaps, he was the only one that was ever worth one hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<HEAD>AN ELEGY, On the DEATH of a LADY.</HEAD>

<L>THE midnight clock has toll'd; and hark, the bell</L>
<L>Of Death beats &s;low! heard ye the note profound?</L>
<L>It pau&s;es now; and now, with ri&s;ing knell,</L>
<L>Flings to the hollow gale its &s;ullen &s;ound.</L>
<L>Yes *** is dead. Attend the &s;train,</L>
<L>Daughters of Albion! Ye that, light as air,</L>
<L>So oft have tript in her fanta&s;tic train,</L>
<L>With hearts as gay, and faces half as fair:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8">
For &s;he was fair beyond your brighte&s;t bloom:</L>
<L>(This Envy owns, &s;ince now her bloom is fled)</L>
<L>Fair as the Forms that, wove in Fancy's loom,</L>
<L>Float in light vi&s;ion round the Poet's head.</L>
<L>Whene'er with &s;oft &s;erenity &s;he &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>Or caught the orient blu&s;h of quick &s;urprize,</L>
<L>How &s;weetly mutable, how brightly wild,</L>
<L>The liquid lu&s;tre darted from her eyes?</L>
<L>Each look, each motion wak'd a new-born grace,</L>
<L>That o'er her form its tran&s;ient glory ca&s;t:</L>
<L>Some lovelier wonder &s;oon u&s;urp'd the place,</L>
<L>Chas'd by a charm &s;till lovelier than the la&s;t.</L>
<L>That bell again! It tells us what &s;he is:</L>
<L>On what &s;he was no more the &s;train prolong:</L>
<L>Luxuriant Fancy pau&s;e: an hour like this</L>
<L>Demands the tribute of a &s;erious Song.</L>
<L>MARIA claims it from that &s;able bier,</L>
<L>Where cold and wan the &s;lumberer re&s;ts her head;</L>
<L>In &s;till &s;mall whi&s;pers to reflection's ear,</L>
<L>She breathes the &s;olemn dictates of the Dead.</L>
<L>O catch the awful notes, and lift them loud;</L>
<L>Proclaim the theme, by Sage, by Fool rever'd;</L>
<L>Hear it, ye Young, ye Vain, ye Great, ye Proud!</L>
<L>'Tis Nature &s;peaks, and Nature will be heard.</L>
<L>Yes, ye &s;hall hear, and tremble as you hear,</L>
<L>While, high with health, your hearts exulting leap:</L>
<L>Ev'n in the mid&s;t of plea&s;ure's mad career,</L>
<L>The mental Monitor &s;hall wake and weep.</L>

<L>Early to lo&s;e; while, born on bu&s;y wing,</L>
<L>Ye &s;ip the nectar of each varying bloom:</L>
<L>Nor fear, while ba&s;king in the beams of &s;pring,</L>
<L>The wintry &s;torm that &s;weeps you to the tomb;</L>
<L>Think of her Fate! revere the heav'nly hand</L>
<L>That led her hence, though &s;oon, by &s;teps &s;o &s;low;</L>
<L>Long at her couch Death took his patient &s;tand,</L>

<L>To give Reflection time, with lenient art,</L>
<L>Each fond delu&s;ion from her &s;oul to &s;teal;</L>
<L>Teach her from Folly peaceably to part,</L>
<L>And wean her from a world &s;he lov'd &s;o well.</L>
<L>Say, are ye &s;ure his Mercy &s;hall extend</L>

<L>Ca&s;ts round Religion's orb the mi&s;ts of fear,</L>
<L>Or &s;hades with horrors, what with &s;miles &s;hould glow.</L>
<L>No; &s;he would warm you with &s;eraphic fire,</L>
<L>Heirs as ye are of heav'n's eternal day;</L>
<L>Would bid you boldly to that heav'n a&s;pire,</L>

<L>The Sting from Death, the Vict'ry from the Grave.</L>
<L>Is this the bigot's rant? Away ye Vain,</L>

Who murders what the poet finely writ,</L>

<L>Repeating what the poet &s;ets not down,</L>

While pau&s;e, and break, and repetition join</L>
<L>To make a di&s;cord in each tuneful line.</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE great character Maphaeus Vegius bore among the learned, may be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for me to have attempted the following tran&s;lation; in which I was the more encouraged, as I do not know of any other ver&s;ion but one by Thomas Twine, doctor of phy&s;ic, printed in the year 1584; and he, I am &s;ure, is no powerful antagoni&s;t. I &s;hall not pretend to critici&s;e upon my author; but &s;hall only ob&s;erve, by the way, that I think him too fond of repetitions, &s;ome of which I have hurried over, and others I have entirely &s;truck out.</P>
<P>Maphaeus Vegius was born at Lodi, in the Milaneze, in the year 1407, and was &s;ecretary of the briefs to pope Martin the Fifth, and afterwards datary. He was like|wi&s;e endowed with a canonry of St. Peter's, with which he was &s;o well contented, that he refu&s;ed a rich bi&s;hoprick. Pope Eugenius the Fourth, and Nicholas the Fifth, out of their regard for his learning, and affection to his per&s;on, continued him in his office of datary.</P>
<P>He died at Rome in the year 1459.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Turnus being &s;lain by Eneas, the Rutuli &s;ubmit to the conqueror, and are &s;uffered to carry off their dead leader with all his armour, except the belt of Pallas, which i~s to be &s;ent back to Evander. Eneas &s;acrifices to the gods. Latinus deplores the death of Turnus. So does Daunus his father, who likewi&s;e laments a great confla|gration, that lays his city in a&s;hes, and is miraculou&s;ly tran&s;|formed into a bird called a heron. Latinus &s;ends me&s;&s;engers to Eneas with propo&s;als of peace, and a treaty of marriage with his daughter Lavinia, which are both accepted. He comes to Lau|rentum, marries the daughter of the king, and at his death &s;ucceeds him in the kingdom, having fir&s;t founded a city of his own, which he names Lavinium. Venus interceeds with Jupiter to make her &s;on a god, which he con&s;ents to. She flies with him to heaven, and he is afterwards wor&s;hipped by the Romans.</P>

<L>DEform'd in du&s;t now Turnus pre&s;s'd the ground,</L>
<L>The &s;oul indignant ru&s;hing from the wound,</L>
<L>While eminent amid the gazing bands,</L>

<L>By &s;torms impell'd, her honours on the ground:</L>
<L>Now, fix'd in earth their &s;pears, the humbled foe</L>

<L>The dreaded fury of de&s;tructive war;</L>
<L>Submit to all the conqu'ror &s;hall impo&s;e,</L>
<L>And pardon crave and end of all their woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when two bulls, inflam'd with martial rage,</L>

<L>The dubious conflict, and their champion's fate;</L>

<L>(For you ne'er in receipts &s;hould &s;tick clo&s;e to the letter:)</L>
<L>Six ounces of &s;ugar next take, and pray mind</L>

<L>The fourth part of a pint you next mu&s;t allow</L>
<L>Of new milk, made as warm as it comes from the cow.</L>
<L>Put the rinds of the lemons, the milk and the &s;yrup,</L>

<L>Let it &s;tand thus three days,&mdash;but remember to &s;hake it;</L>
