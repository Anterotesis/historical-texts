<P>_I Have purpo&s;ely avoided du|ring the whole Cour&s;e of this Paper, to &s;peak any Thing concerning the Treatment which is due to &s;uch Per&s;ons as have been concerned in the late Rebellion, becau&s;e I would not &s;eem to irritate Ju&s;tice again&s;t tho&s;e who are under the Pro&s;ecution of the Law, nor incen&s;e any of my Readers again&s;t unhappy, tho'
<PB N="4" REF="4">
guilty Men. But when we find the Proceed|ings of our Government in this particular traduced and mi&s;repre&s;ented, it is the Duty of every good Subject to &s;et them in their proper Light.</P>
<P>I am the more prompted to this Undertak|ing by a Pamphlet, intituled, <HI>An Argument to prove the Affections of the People of</HI> England <HI>to to be the be&s;t Security of the Government; humbly offer'd to the Con&s;ideration of the Patrons of Severi|ty, and applied to the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs.</HI> Had the whole Scope of the Author been an&s;werable to his Title, he would have only undertaken to prove what every Man in his Wits is already convinced of. But the Drift of the Pamphlet is, to &s;tir up our Compa&s;&s;ion towards the Rebels, and our Indignation again&s;t the Government. The Author who knew that &s;uch a De&s;ign as this could not be carried on without a great deal of Artifice and Sophi&s;try, has puzzled and perplexed his Cau&s;e, by throw|ing his Thoughts together in &s;uch a &s;tudied Confu&s;ion; that upon this Account, if upon any his Pamphlet is, as the Party have repre&s;ented it, unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>The famous Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bayle</HI> compares th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> an&s;wering of an immethodical Author, to the Hunting of a Duck: when you have him full in your Sight, and fancy your &s;elf within reach of him, he gives you the &s;lip and becomes in|vi&s;ible. His Argument is lo&s;t in &s;uch a va|riety
<PB N="5" REF="5">
of Marter, that you mu&s;t catch it where you can as it ri&s;es, and di&s;appears in the &s;everal Parts of his Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Writer of this Pamphlet could doubt|le&s;s have ranged his Thoughts in much bet|ter Order, if he had plea&s;ed: But he knew very well, that Error is not to be advanced by Per&s;picuity. In order therefore to An|&s;wer this Pamphlet, I mu&s;t reduce the Sub|&s;tance of it under proper Heads: And di&s;|embroil the Thoughts of the Author, &s;ince he did not think fit to do it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, That the Terms which the Author makes u&s;e of, are loo&s;e, general, and undefined, as will be &s;hewn in the Sequel of this Paper; and, what le&s;s becomes a fair Rea&s;oner, he puts wrong and invidious Names on every Thing to colour a fal&s;e Way of arguing.</P>
<P>He allows that <HI>the Rebels indi&s;putably merit to be &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed;</HI> that they <HI>de&s;erve it ac|cording to Law;</HI> and that <HI>if they are puni&s;hed, they have none to thank but them&s;elves</HI> (Pag. 7.) How can a Man after &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion make &s;ometimes u&s;e of the Word <HI>Cruelty,</HI> but gene|rally of <HI>Revenge,</HI> when he pleads again&s;t the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;e of that, which, according to his own Notion, is at the mo&s;t but rigid Ju&s;tice! Or why are &s;uch Executions, which, according to his own Opinion are Legal, &s;o often to be called <HI>Violences</HI> and <HI>Slaughter?</HI> Not to mention the Appellations given to tho&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="6">
who do not agree with him in his Opinion for Clemency, as the <HI>Blood-thir&s;ty,</HI> the <HI>Politi|cal Butchers, State Chirurgeons,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall now &s;peak of that Point which is the great and reigning Fallacy of the Pam|phlet and runs more or le&s;s through every Paragraph. His whole Argument turns up|on this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration; <HI>Whether the King &s;hould exert Mercy or Ju&s;tice towards tho&s;e who have openly appeared in the pre&s;ent Rebellion?</HI> By <HI>Mercy</HI> he means a <HI>general Pardon;</HI> by <HI>Ju|stice</HI> a <HI>general Puni&s;hment;</HI> &s;o that he &s;uppo&s;es no other Method practicable in the Juncture, than either the forgiving All, or the execut|ing All. Thus he puts the Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it be the Intere&s;t of the Prince to de&s;troy the Rebels by Fire, Sword, or Gibbet</HI> (pag. 4.) And &s;peak|ing of the <HI>Zealots for the Government,</HI> he tells us, <HI>They think no Remedy &s;o good as to make clear Work; and that they declare for the utter Extir|pation of all who are its Enemies in the mo&s;t mi|nute Circum&s;tances: As if Amputation were the &s;ole Remedy the&s;e political Butchers could find out for the Di&s;tempers of a State; or that they thought the only way to make the Top flouri&s;h, were to lop off the Under-Branches.</HI> (p. 5.) He then &s;peakes of the <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e Politicians, and the Ca&s;ui&s;ts in Red-Coats; Who,</HI> he tells us, <HI>are for the utmo&s;t Rigour that their Laws of War or Laws of Conveniencie can in&s;pire them with.</HI> (p. 5.) Again, <HI>It is repre&s;ented,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that the Rebels de&s;erve the highest Puni&s;hment the Laws can inflict.</HI> (p. 7.)
<PB N="7" REF="7">
And afterwards tells us, <HI>The Que&s;tion is, Whe|ther the Government &s;hall &s;hew Mercy, or take a Reverend Divine's Advice, to &s;lay Man and Wo|man, Infant and Suckling?</HI> (p. 8.) Thus again he tells us, <HI>The Friends to &s;evere Coun&s;els alledge, that the Government ought not to be moved by Com|pa&s;&s;ion;</HI> and that <HI>the Law &s;hould have its Cour&s;e.</HI> (p. 9.) And in another Place puts the&s;e Words in their Mouths, <HI>He may &s;till retain their Affection, and yet let the Laws have their Cour&s;e in puni&s;hing the Guilty.</HI> (p. 18.) He goes upon the &s;ame Suppo&s;ition in the fol|lowing Pa&s;&s;ages: <HI>It is impracticable in &s;o gene|ral a Corruption to de&s;troy</HI> All <HI>who are infected; and unle&s;s you de&s;troy</HI> All <HI>you do nothing to the purpo&s;e.</HI> (p. 10.) <HI>Shall our rightful King &s;hew him&s;elf le&s;s the true Father of his People, and af|ford his Pardon to</HI> None <HI>of tho&s;e People, who (like King</HI> Lear <HI>to his Daughter) had &s;o great a Confi|dence in his Vertue as to give him All.</HI> (p. 25.) I &s;hall only add, that the concluding Para|graph which is worked up with &s;o much artificial Horrour, goes upon a Suppo&s;ition an&s;werable to the whole Tenor of the Pam|phlet; and implies, that <HI>the Impeach'd Lords</HI> were to be Executeed without Exception or Di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what is the Author's Idea of that Ju&s;tice again&s;t which all his Arguments are levell'd. If, in the next place, we con|&s;ider the Nature of that Clemency which he
<PB N="8" REF="8">
recommends, we find it to be no le&s;s uni|ver&s;al and unre&s;train'd.</P>
<P>He declares for a <HI>General Act of Indemnity,</HI> (p. 20.) and tells us, <HI>It is the Sen&s;e of every di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Man of the Kingdom, that the Rebels may, and ought to be Pardoned,</HI> (p. 19.) <HI>One popular Act,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>would even yet retrieve all,</HI> (p. 22.) He declares him&s;elf not <HI>over-fond of the Doctrines of making Examples of Traitors,</HI> (ibid.) And that <HI>the Way to prevent Things from being brought to an Extremity, is to deal mildly with tho&s;e unfortunate Gentlemen engaged in the Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader may now &s;ee in how fallaci|ous a Manner this Writer has &s;tated the Controver&s;y: He &s;uppo&s;es there are but two Methods of treating the Rebels; that is, by cutting off every one of them to a Man, or pardoning every one of them without Di|&s;tinction. Now if there be a third Method between the&s;e two extreams, which is on all Accounts more eligible than either of them, it is certain that the whole Cour&s;e of his Argumentation comes to nothing. Every Man of the plaine&s;t Under&s;tanding will ea&s;ily conclude, that in the Ca&s;e before us, as in mo&s;t others, we ought to av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">id both Extreams; that to de&s;troy every Rebel would be an exce&s;&s;ive Severity, and to for|give every one of them an unrea&s;onable Weakne&s;s. The proper Method of Pro|ceeding, is that which the Author has pur|po&s;ely
<GAP DESC="missing" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ pages">
<PB N="17" REF="9">
<HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>The very Means, or the Ap|prehen&s;ions of them, have brought Things to the Pa&s;s in which they are, and con&s;equently will reduce them from Bad to Wor&s;e,</HI> (P. 10.) And afterwards, <HI>This Growth of Di&s;affection is in a great Mea&s;ure owing to the groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies Men entertained of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration; as if they were to expect nothing but Cruelty un|der it.</HI> If our Author would have &s;poken out, and have applyed the&s;e Effects to the real Cau&s;e, he would have a&s;cribed this Change of Affections among the People, to nothing el&s;e but the Change of the Mini&s;try; for we find that a great many Per&s;ons lo&s;t their Loyalty with their Places; and that their Friends have ever &s;ince made U&s;e of the mo&s;t ba&s;e Methods to infu&s;e tho&s;e ground|le&s;s Di&s;contents into the Minds of the com|mon People, which have brought &s;o many of them to the Brink of De&s;truction, and proved &s;o detrimental to their fellow Subjects.</P>
<P>However, this Proceeding has &s;hewen how dangerous it would have been for his Maje|&s;ty to have continued in their Places of Tru&s;t, a Set of Men, &s;ome of whom have &s;ince actu|ally joined with the <HI>Pretender</HI> to his Crown, while others may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected never to have been faithful to him in their Hearts, or at lea&s;t, who&s;e Principles are precarious, and vi&s;ibly conducted by their Intere&s;t. In a word, if the removal of the&s;e Per&s;ons from their Po&s;ts has produced &s;uch popular Com|motions
<PB N="18" REF="10">
the continuance of them might have produced &s;omething much more fatal to their King and Country, and have brought about that Revolution which has now been in vain attempted. The Condition of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King would be very poor indeed, &s;hould a Party of his Subjects threaten him with a Rebellion upon his bringing Male|factors to Ju&s;tice, or upon his refu&s;ing to employ tho&s;e whom he dare not tru&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention another Argument again&s;t the Puni&s;hment of any of the Rebels, who&s;e Executions he repre&s;ents as very &s;hocking to the People, becau&s;e they are their Country-men. (p. 12.) And again, <Q REND="inline">"The Quality of the Sufferers, their Alli|ance, their Character, their being <HI>Engli&s;h|men,</HI> with a thou&s;and other Circum&s;tances will contribute to breed more ill Blood than all the State Chirurgeons can po&s;&s;ibly let out." (p. 12.)</Q> The impeached Lords likewi&s;e in the la&s;t Paragraph of the Pamph|let are recommended to our Pity, becau&s;e they are our Country-men. By this way of rea&s;oning, no Man that is a Gentleman, or born within the three Seas, &s;hould be Sub|ject to capital Puni&s;hment. Be&s;ides, who can be guilty of Rebellion that are not our Country-men? As for the endearing Name of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> which he be&s;tows upon every one of the Criminals, he &s;hould con&s;ider that a Man de&s;ervedly cuts him&s;elf off from
<PB N="19" REF="11">
the Affections as well as the Priviledges of that Community which he endeavours to &s;ubvert.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;everal Arguments which appear in different Forms and Expre&s;&s;ions thro' this whole Pamphlet, and under which every one that is urged in it may be reduced: There is indeed another Set of them, de|rived from the Example and Authority of great Per&s;ons, which the Author pro|duces in favours of his own Scheme. The&s;e are <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. of <HI>France</HI> our late King <HI>William,</HI> King <HI>Solomon</HI> and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> If a Man were di&s;po&s;ed to draw Arguments for Severity out of Hi&s;tory, how many In&s;tances might one find of it among the greate&s;t Princes of every Nation; but as different Princes may act very laudably by different Methods in diffe|rent Conjunctures, I cannot think this a conclu&s;ive way of rea&s;oning. However, let us examine this Set of Arguments and we &s;hall find them no le&s;s defective than tho&s;e above-mentioned.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"One of the greate&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mo|narchs, <HI>&s;ays our Author was</HI> William <HI>the Con|queror,</HI> and he was the greater, becau&s;e he put to Death only one Per&s;on of Quality that we read of, and him after repeated Treacheries; yet he was a Foreigner, had Power &s;ufficient, and did not want Pro|vocations to have been more bloody." (p. 27.)</Q>
<PB N="20" REF="12">
Per&s;on of Quality was the Farl of <HI>Waltheof,</HI> who being overtaken with Wine, engaged in a Con&s;piracy again&s;t this King, but repent|ing of it the next Morning, came to him in Per&s;on and revealed the whole Matter, not|with&s;tanding of which, he was Beheaded upon the Defeat of the Con&s;piracy; for hav|ing, but thus far tampered in it, and as for the re&s;t of the Con&s;pirators, who ro&s;e in an actual Rebellion, the King u&s;ed them with the utmo&s;t Rigor, he cut off the Heads of &s;ome, put out the Eyes of others, &s;ome were hanged upon Gibbets, and tho&s;e who faired the be&s;t were &s;ent into Bani&s;hment. There are indeed the mo&s;t dreadful Examples of Se|verity in this Reign: Tho' it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;t, that, after the manner of the&s;e Times, the Nobility generally e&s;caped with their Lives, tho' Multudes of them were puni&s;h|ed with Bani&s;hment, perpetual Impri&s;on|ment, Forfeitures, and other great Severities; while the poor People who had been delud|ed by the&s;e their Ring-Leaders, were executed with the utmo&s;t Rigour. A Partiality, which I believe, no Commoner of <HI>England</HI> will ever think it to be either ju&s;t or rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The next In&s;tance is <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. of <HI>France,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Who <HI>(&s;ays our Author)</HI> &s;o hand&s;ome|ly expre&s;t his Tenderne&s;s for his People, when at &s;igning the Treaty of <HI>Vervines, he &s;aid,</HI> That by one Da&s;h of his Pen he had overcome more Enemies than he could
<PB N="21" REF="13">
ever be able to do with his Sword."</Q> Would not an ordinary Reader think this Treaty of <HI>Vervins</HI> was a Treaty between <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. and a Party of his Subjects, for otherwi&s;e, how can it have a Place in the pre&s;ent Argu|ment. But in&s;tead of that, it was a Treaty between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> So that the Speech expre&s;&s;ed an equal Tenderne&s;s to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French:</HI> As Multitudes of either Nation mu&s;t have fallen in that War, had it continued longer. As for this King's Treatment of the Con&s;pirators (tho' he is quoted thrice in the Pamphlet as an Ex|ample of Clemency) you have an eminent In&s;tance of it in his Behaviour to the Mar|&s;hall <HI>de Biron,</HI> who had been his old faithful Servant, and had contributed more than any one to his Advancement to the Throne. This Mar&s;hall upon &s;ome Di&s;content was entred into a Con&s;piracy again&s;t his Ma&s;ter, and refu&s;ing to open the whole Secret to the King, he was &s;ent to the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and there Beheaded, notwith&s;tanding he &s;ought for Mercy with great Importunities, and in the mo&s;t moving Manner: There are other In|&s;tances in this King's Reign, who notwith|&s;tanding, was remarkable for his Clemency, of Rebels and Con&s;pirators who were hang|ed, beheaded, or broken alive on the Wheel.</P>
<P>The late King <HI>William</HI> was not di&s;turbed by any Rebellion from tho&s;e who had once &s;ubmitted to him; But we know he treated the
<PB N="22" REF="14">
Per&s;ons concerned in the <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;ination-Plot,</HI> as &s;o horrid a Con&s;piracy de&s;erved. As for the Saying which this Author imputes to that Monarch, it being a Piece of &s;ecret Hi&s;tory, One doth not know when it was &s;poken, or what it alluded to, unle&s;s the Author had been more particular in the Account of it.</P>
<P>The Author proceeds in the next Place, to no le&s;s an Authority than that of <HI>Solomon:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Among&s;t all the general Ob&s;ervations of the wi&s;e&s;t Princes we know of, I think there is none holds more univer&s;ally, that Mercy and Truth pre&s;erve a King, and his Throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed in Mercy," (P. 18.)</Q> If we compare the different Sayings of this wi&s;e King, which relate to the Conduct of Prin|ces, we cannot que&s;tion, but that he means by this Mercy, that Kind of it which is con|&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on and Government, and by which we hope to &s;ee his Maje&s;ty's Throne e&s;tabli&s;hed. But our Author &s;hould con&s;ider, that the &s;ame wi&s;e Man hath &s;aid in another Place, <HI>That an evil Man &s;eeketh Rebellion, there|fore a cruel Me&s;&s;enger &s;hall be &s;ent again&s;t him.</HI> Accordingly his Practice was agreeable to his Proverb, no Prince having given a greater Te&s;timony of his Abhorrence to Undertak|ings of this trea&s;onable Nature. For he di&s;|patched &s;uch a cruel Me&s;&s;enger as is here mentioned, to tho&s;e who had been engaged in a Rebellion, many Years before he him|&s;elf was on the Throne, and even to his elder
<PB N="23" REF="15">
Brother, upon the bare Su&s;picion, That he was projecting &s;o wicked an Enterprize.</P>
<P>How the Example of the <HI>Pretender</HI> came into this Argument, I am at a Lo&s;s to find out, <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Pretender</HI> declared a general Par|don to all, and, &s;hall our rightful King &s;hew himfelf le&s;s the true Father of his People, and afford his Pardon to none," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (P. 25.)</Q> The <HI>Pretender</HI>'s general Pardon was to a People who were not in his Power; and had he ever reduced them under it, it was only promi&s;ed to &s;uch as immediately joined with him for the Recovery of what he called his Right. It was &s;uch a general Pardon as would have been con&s;i&s;tent with the Execu|tion of more than nine Parts of ten of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>There is but one more hi&s;torical Argu|ment, which is drawn from King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Treatment of the <HI>Catalans:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"I think it would not be un&s;ea&s;onable for &s;ome Men to recollect what their own Notions were of the Treatment of the <HI>Catalans,</HI> how many Declamations were made on the Barbari|ty u&s;ed towards them by King <HI>Philip,</HI>" (P. 29.)</Q> If the Author remembers, the&s;e Declamations, as he calls them, were not made &s;o much on the Barbarity u&s;ed towards them by King <HI>Philip,</HI> as on the Barbarity u&s;ed towards them by the <HI>Engli&s;h Govern|ment.</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> might have &s;ome Colour for treating them as Rebels, but we ought to
<PB N="24" REF="16">
have regarded them as Allies; and were o|bliged by all the Ties of Honour, Con&s;ci|ence, and publick Faith, to have &s;heltered them from tho&s;e Sufferings which were brought upon them by a firm and inviolable Adherence to our Intere&s;ts. However, none can draw into a Parallel the Cruelties which have been inflicted on that unhappy People, with tho&s;e few In&s;tances of Severity which our Government has been obliged to exert to|wards the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rebels. I &s;ay, no Man would make &s;uch a Parallel, unle&s;s his Mind be &s;o blinded with Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice, as to a&s;&s;ert in the Language of this Pamphlet, <HI>That no In&s;tances can be produced of the lea&s;t Le|nity under the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, from the fir&s;t Hour it commenced to this Day,</HI> (P. 20.) with other a&s;toni&s;hing Reflections of the &s;ame Nature, which are contradicted by &s;uch innumerable Matters of Fact, that it would be an Affront to a Readers Under|&s;tanding to endeavour to confute them. But to return to the <HI>Catalans,</HI> during <HI>the whole cour&s;e of the War,</HI> &s;ays the Author, <HI>which ever of them &s;ubmitted to Di&s;cretion, were received to Mercy.</HI> (p. 22.) This is &s;o far from being truly related, that in the beginning of the War they were executed without Mercy, but when in Conjunction with their Allies, they became Superior to King <HI>Philips</HI> Party in Strength, and extended their Conque&s;ts up to the very Gates of <HI>Madrid:</HI> It cannot

And it would be well if all tho&s;e who &s;till adhere to the Cau&s;e of that unfortunate King, and are clamorous at the Proceedings of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, would re|member, that notwith&s;tanding, that Rebellion fell very much &s;hort of this, both in the Number and Strength of the Rebels, and had no Tendency either to de&s;troy the National Religion, to introduce an Ar|bitrary Government, or to &s;ubject us to a Foreign Power: Not only the Chief of the Rebels was be|beheaded, but even a Lady, who had only harbour|ed one of the Offenders in her Hou&s;e, was in her extream old Age put to the &s;ame Kind of Death: That about Two Hundred and Thirty were hanged, drawen, and quartered, and their Limbs di&s;per&s;ed thro' &s;everal Parts of the Country, and &s;et up as Spe|ctacles of Terror to their fellow Subjects. It would be too tedious a Work to run thro' the numberle&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Fines, Impri&s;onments, Corporal Puni&s;hments and Tran&s;portations, which were then likewi&s;e practi&s;ed as whole&s;ome Severities.</P>
<P>We have now &s;een how fallaciou&s;ly the Author has &s;tated the Cau&s;e he has undertaken, by &s;uppo&s;ing that nothing but unlimited Mercy, or unlimited Puni&s;hment, are the Methods that can be made u&s;e of in our pre&s;ent Treatment of the Rebels; That he has omitted the middle Way of Proceeding be|tween the&s;e two Extreams: That this Middle-Way is the Method in which his Maje&s;ty, like all other Wi&s;e and Good Kings, has cho&s;en to proceed, that it is agreeable to the Nature of Government, Religion, and onr <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution: And that every Argu|ment which the Author has produced from Rea&s;on and Example, would have been a true one, had it been urged from that re&s;trained Clemency which his Maje&s;ty has exerci&s;ed; But it is a fal&s;e one, when applyed to &s;uch a general undi&s;tingui&s;hing Mercy, as the Author would recommend.</P>
<P>Having thus an&s;wered, that, which is the main Drift and De&s;ign of this Pamphlet, I &s;hall touch upon tho&s;e other Parts of it, which are interwoven with the Arguments, to put Men out of Humour with the pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<P>And here we may ob&s;erve, that it is our Authors Method, to &s;uppo&s;e Matters of Fact, which are not in Being, and afterwards to di&s;cant upon them, as he is very &s;en&s;ible, that the Cau&s;e will not bear the Teft of Rea&s;on, he has indeed every where cho&s;en ra|ther Topicks for Declamation than Argument, thus he intertains us with a laboured Invective again&s;t a &s;tanding Army; But what has this to do in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e; I &s;uppo&s;e he would not advi&s;e his Maje|&s;ty to disband his Forces, while there is an Army of Rebels in his Dominions: I cannot imagine he would think the Affections of the People of <HI>England</HI> a Security of the Government in &s;uch a Juncture, were it not at the &s;ame Time defended with a &s;uffi|cient Body of Troops. No Prince has ever given a greater In&s;tance of his Inclinations to rule without a &s;tanding Army, if we con&s;ider, that upon the very

fir&s;t News of the Defeat of the Rebels, he declared to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, that he had put an immediare Stop to the Levies, which he had begun to rai&s;e at their Reque&s;t, and that he would not make u&s;e of the Power which they had entru&s;ted him with, unle&s;s any new Preparations of the Enemy &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary for our Defence; This Speech was received with the greate&s;t Gratitude by both Hou&s;es, and it is &s;aid, that in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, a very candide and honourable Gentleman (who generally votes with the Minority) declared that he had not heard &s;o gracious a Speech from the Throne, for many Years la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>In another Place, he &s;uppo&s;es that the Govern|ment has not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">eavoured to gain the Applau&s;e of the Vulgar, by doing &s;omething for the Church; And very gravely makes Excu&s;es for this their pre|tended Neglect. What greater In&s;tances could his Maje&s;ty have given of his Love to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than the&s;e he has exhibited by his mo&s;t &s;o|lemn Declarations; by his dayly Example, and by his Promotions of the mo&s;t eminent among&s;t the Clergy, to &s;uch Vacancies as have happened in his Reign: To which we mu&s;t add for the Honour of his Government in this Particular, that, it has done more for the Advantage of the Clergy, than tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t zealous for their Intere&s;t, could have expected in &s;o &s;hort a Time: Which will further appear, if we reflect upon the Valuable and Royal Donative to one of our Univer&s;ities, and the Provi&s;ion made for tho&s;e who are to officiate in the Fifty new Churches. His Maje&s;ty is indeed a Prince of too much Magnanimity and Truth, to make u&s;e of the Name of the Church, for drawing his Peo|ple into any Thing that may be prejudicial unto them: For what our Author &s;ays to this Purpo&s;e, redounds as much to the Honour of the pre&s;ent Ad|mini&s;tration, as to the Di&s;grace of others: <HI>Nay, I wi&s;h with all my Soul they had &s;tooped a little</HI> ad captum vulgi <HI>to take in the&s;e fluttering Hearts, which are to be caught by any Thing called with the Name of Church.</HI> P. II. Again the Authorasks, <HI>Whether Terror is to become</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="28">
<HI>the only National Principle;</HI> with other Que&s;tions of the &s;ame Nature: And in &s;everal Parts of his Book harangues very plentifully again&s;t &s;uch a Notion, where he talks in Generals upon this Topick: There is no Que&s;tion, but every <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> in the Kingdom, perfectly agrees with him in what he &s;ays, but if he would in&s;inuate, as he &s;eems to do in &s;e|veral Places, that there &s;hould be no Impre&s;&s;ions of Awe upon the Mind of a Subject, and that a Go|vernment &s;hould not create Terror in tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to do Ill, as well as encourage tho&s;e that do their Duty: In &s;hort, if he is for an entire Exclu|&s;ion of that Principle of Fear, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome Influence in every Law, he oppo&s;es him|&s;elf to the Form of every Governm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the World, and to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind.</P>
<P>The Artifice of this Author in &s;tarting Objections, to the Friends of the Government, and the fooli&s;h An&s;wers which he &s;uppo&s;es they return to them, is &s;o very vi&s;ible, that every one &s;ees they are de&s;ign'd rather to divert his Reader, than to in&s;truct him.</P>
<P>I have now examined this whole Pamphlet, which indeed is written with a great deal of Art, and as much Argument as the Cau&s;e would bear; And af|ter having &s;tated the true Notion of <HI>Clemency, Mer|cy, Compa&s;&s;ion, Good-Nature, Humanity,</HI> or whatever el&s;e it may be called, &s;o far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with Wi&s;dom, and the Good of Manking, or in other Words, &s;o far as it is a Moral Virtue, I &s;hall readily concur with the Author in the highe&s;t Panegyrick that he has be&s;towed upon it; As likeways, I heartily join with him in every Thing, he has &s;aid again&s;t Ju&s;tice, if it concludes as his Pamphlet &s;up|po&s;es, the Extirpation of every Criminal, and is not exerci&s;ed with a much greater Mixture of <HI>Clemency</HI> than <HI>Rigour. Mercy</HI> in the true Sen&s;e of the Word, is that Virtue, by which a Prince approaches neare&s;t to him, whom he repre&s;ents; And whil&s;t he is nei|ther remi&s;s, nor extream to animadvert upon tho&s;e who offend him, that Logick will hold true of him, which is applyed to the great Judge of all the Earth: <HI>With thee there is Mercy, therefore &s;halt thou be feared.</HI></P>
