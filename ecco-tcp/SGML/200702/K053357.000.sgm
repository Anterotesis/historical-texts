<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE De&s;ign of this &s;mall Treati&s;e, is to le&s;&s;en if not prevent the com|mon Practice of Thiev|ing, and &s;ave many Lives of the loo&s;e and indigent Vulgar, of which now &s;uch great Numbers are yearly lavi&s;h'd away for Trifles. In order to this, I have en|deavour'd to &s;et in a true Light the
<PB REF="4">
de&s;tructive Con&s;equences of <HI>Theftbote,</HI> and the Damage the Publick &s;u&s;tains from the Trade that is drove by Thiefcatchers, and the various ways now in vogue of compounding Felo|nies, by which the Safety as well as Main|tenance of Thieves and Pilferers are indu|&s;triou&s;ly taken care of, and the Laws that enforce Pro&s;ecution altogether eluded.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e I have pointed at the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and other Di&s;or|ders of <HI>Newgate,</HI> ari&s;ing from the wrong Method we have of treating common Felons in Pri&s;on. I have de&s;crib'd the Tran&s;actions of Execution Day, with the Proce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> and demon|&s;trated what &s;mall Advantage they are of, as well to the condemn'd them&s;elves, who&s;e grand Affair it is to prepare
<PB REF="5">
them&s;elves for another World, as to their Companions who &s;hould be deter|red, or the re&s;t of the Spectators, who &s;hould be &s;truck with the Awfulne&s;s of the Solemnity. I have likewi&s;e &s;earch|ed into the Origin of Courage, and the wrong Judgments that are differently pa&s;s'd on the dying Behaviour of Ma|lefactors, &s;hew'd the ill Con&s;equences as well as Ab&s;urdity of our mi&s;taking Drunkenne&s;s for Intrepidity, and a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s Deportment for Undauntedne&s;s; and touch'd on the &s;everal Neglects and Mi&s;managements that are acce&s;&s;ary, and one way or other contribute to the En|crea&s;e and Support of Felons, and con|&s;equently, the Frequency of Executions. Afterwards I have in a Chapter by it &s;elf offer'd &s;ome Propo&s;als for a better U&s;age, and more proper Treatment of
<PB REF="6">
common Felons in Confinement, and made a Pathetical Repre&s;entation of the good Effects we might probably expect from &s;uch whole&s;ome Regulations. To the&s;e I have added a Di&s;cour&s;e on Tran&s;portation, and a Method of ren|dering that Puni&s;hment not only more effectual on the Criminals, but like|wi&s;e advantagious to the Publick in the mo&s;t extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o vain as to place any Me|rit in the Performance, or promi&s;e my &s;elf the Applau&s;e of many: on the con|trary, I expect to be cen&s;ur'd, and per|haps de&s;ervedly, for the uncouth Deco|rations I have intermix'd with my Sub|ject. Men of Ta&s;te and Politene&s;s will think them&s;elves very little oblig'd to me for entertaining them with the
<PB REF="7">
meane&s;t and mo&s;t abject part of low Life, for almo&s;t a whole Chapter toge|ther; and tell me that the In&s;ide of <HI>Newgate,</HI> either on an Execution Day, or any other, is not a Scene they ought to be troubled with; and that the Exactne&s;s of a Picture among the Judicious is of little Worth where the noble manner is wanting. To this I could an&s;wer that, if I have tre&s;pa&s;|&s;ed again&s;t the Laws either of Elegance or Formality, I was forc'd to it by what is &s;uperior to all Laws, Nece&s;&s;ity. When a Man is to in&s;pire his Rea|ders with an Aver&s;ion to what they are unacquainted with, he can ne|ver compa&s;s his End without fur|ni&s;hing them fir&s;t with a general Idea of the Thing again&s;t which he wou'd rai&s;e their Indignation: I could add that,
<PB REF="8">
when a Piece is lively and tolerably fi|ni&s;h'd, the good-natured Critick will pardon the Meane&s;s of the De&s;ign, for the &s;ake of the Colouring and the Ap|plication of the Ma&s;ter. But if nei|ther of the&s;e Excu&s;es are thought &s;uf|ficient, I mu&s;t plead guilty, and confe&s;s that the Plea&s;ure there is in imitating Nature in what Shape &s;oever is &s;o be|witching, that it over-rules the Dictates of Art, and often forces us to offend a|gain&s;t our own Judgment.</P>
<P>As there are in this City not a few Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s and good Under&s;tand|ing, who&s;e Lei&s;ure allows them not to read much beyond the Publick News, and mo&s;t of them are concern'd in the Contents of this Pamphlet, I cau&s;ed the &s;everal Chapters of it to be Printed in
<PB REF="9">
as many Papers of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Journal; imagining that its having been di&s;pers'd, and, as it were, advertis'd in that man|ner, could give no Offence to the more Curious, who would chu&s;e to have it entire by it &s;elf, and per u&s;e it in a Character le&s;s trouble&s;ome to the Eyes.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Chapter I &s;hould have taken notice of a Clau&s;e in an Act of Parliament that was made in the Fourth Year of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and is call'd, <HI>An Act for the further Prevent|ing Robbery, Burglary, and other Felcnies,</HI> &amp;c. The candid Reader I hope will pardon the Neglect, occa&s;ion'd by the &s;mall Acquaintance I have with the Law, and give me leave in this Place to repair that Omi&s;&s;ion. The Words are the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">
<HI>And whereas there are &s;everal Per&s;ons who have &s;ecret Acquaintance with</HI> Felons, <HI>and who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to help Per&s;ons to their &s;tollen Goods, and by that Means gain Money from them, which is di|vided between them and the</HI> Felons, <HI>where|by they greatly encourage &s;uch Offenders:</HI> Be it Enacted by the Authority afore&s;aid, <HI>That whenever any Per&s;on taketh Money or Reward, directly or indirectly, under Pre|tence, or upon account of helping any Per|&s;on or Per&s;ons to any &s;tollen Goods or Chat|tels, every &s;uch Per&s;on &s;o taking Money or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> as afore&s;aid (unle&s;s &s;uch Per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, or cau&s;e to be apprehended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> who &s;tole the &s;ame, and cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> to be brought to his Trial for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> give Evidence again&s;t him) &s;hall be guilty of</HI> Felony, <HI>and &s;uffer the Pains and Penalties of</HI> Felony, <HI>according to the Felony committed in &s;tealing &s;uch Goods, and in &s;uch and the &s;ame manner, as if &s;uch Offender had him&s;elf &s;tole &s;uch Goods and Chattels, in the manner and with &s;uch Circum&s;tances as the &s;ame were &s;tollen.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="11">
Since the Printing of the&s;e Chapters, in the Paper afore&s;aid, I have likewi&s;e been inform'd; that, as receiving Mo|ney for a&s;&s;i&s;ting others in the Recove|ry of their &s;tolen Goods, is by this Act made Felony; &s;o by the known Rules of Law, whoever is aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting thereto is of Cour&s;e guilty as an Acce&s;&s;ary, and to incurr the &s;ame Puni&s;hment as the Principal: and it cannot be doubted; but that he, who pays Money on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, is acce&s;&s;ary to the Receiving of it: which well de&s;erves the Reflection of tho&s;e who make no Scruple of redeeming the Goods that had been &s;tolen from them; as likewi&s;e does another Thing, which is, that if he who takes Money for &s;to|len Goods is a principal Felon, and that he who pays it is a Felon, as being ac|ce&s;&s;ary,
<PB REF="12">
then he who by publick Ad|verti&s;ements with Promi&s;es of Secrecy, and that no Que&s;tions &s;hall be asked, invites others to commit Felony, is guil|ty of a great Mi&s;demeanour, tho' it pro|duce no Effect; but, if it do, the Per|&s;on publi&s;hing &s;uch Adverti&s;ement will be an Acce&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of</HI> THEFTBOTE; <HI>or, the Crime of Compounding of Felony.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Multitude of unhap|py Wretches, that every Year are put to Death for Trifles in our great Metro|polis, has long been affli|cting to Men of Pity and Humanity; and continues to give great Unea&s;ine&s;s to every Per&s;on, who has a Value for his Kind. Many good Projects have been thought of to cure this Evil, by &s;apping the Foundation of it: A Society has been &s;et up to reform our Manners; and neither Workhou&s;es, nor Di&s;ci|pline on &s;mall Crimes, have been wanting: An Act has been made again&s;t prophane Cur|&s;ing and Swearing; and many Charity Schools have been erected. But the Event has not an&s;wer'd hitherto the good De&s;ign of tho&s;e Endeavours. This City abounds as much with
<PB N="2" REF="16">
loo&s;e, lazy, and di&s;hone&s;t Poor; there is as much Mi&s;chief done by ordinary Felons; and Executions for Theft and Burglary are as fre|quent, at lea&s;t, as ever: Nay, it is believed, that <HI>London</HI> is more pe&s;ter'd with low Villany than any other Place whatever, the Proporti|on of Bigne&s;s between them not left uncon|&s;ider'd. As there is no Effect without a Cau&s;e, &s;o &s;omething mu&s;t be the Rea&s;on of this Ca|lamity. I have long and carefully examined into this Matter, and am forced to a&s;cribe the Mi&s;chief complained of to two palpable Evils, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e we have in common with other large overgrown Cities. One regards Pro&s;ecutions; the other the Treatment that is given to Malefactors after they are taken. I &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t: I mean the Neglect of them, occa&s;ion'd by our &s;hameful Nego|tiations with Thieves, or their Agents, for the Recovery of &s;tolen Goods, by which, in Reality, we become Aiders and Abetters to them.</P>
<P>The Law of <HI>England</HI> is &s;o tender of Mens Lives, that whoever ju&s;tly pro&s;ecutes, and convicts a Per&s;on of a Capital Crime, has no|thing to an&s;wer for to his Con&s;cience, but, on the contrary, has done a Service to his Country, without Offence to God, or the lea&s;t Breach of Charity to his Neighbour. But as every Body has not Strength of Mind and Re|&s;olution enough to perform Duties that are repugnant to his Nature, &s;o, making Allow|ances
<PB N="3" REF="17">
for Human Frailties, I could excu&s;e the Backwardne&s;s of a meek home-bred Per&s;on, who &s;hould complain, That to appear in open Court, and &s;peak before a Judge, are terrible Things to him. But I think it unpardonable, that a Man &s;hould knowingly act again&s;t the Law, and by &s;o doing powerfully contribute to the Increa&s;e, as well as Safety and Main|tenance, of Pilferers and Robbers, from no other Principle, than a criminal Selfi&s;hne&s;s, accompany'd with an utter Di&s;regard to the Publick: Yet nothing is more common a|mong us. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This was wrote &s;ome Months before</HI> Jonathan Wild <HI>was apprehended.</HI></NOTE> As &s;oon as any Thing is mi&s;&s;ing, &s;u&s;pected to be &s;tolen, the fir&s;t Cour&s;e we &s;teer is directly to the Office of Mr. <HI>Jonathan Wild.</HI> If what we want is a Trinket, either enamel'd, or otherwi&s;e curiou&s;ly wrought; if there is Painting about it; if it be a parti|cular Ring, the Gift of a Friend; or any Thing which we e&s;teem above the real Va|lue, and offer more for it than Mr. <HI>Thief</HI> can make of it, we are look'd upon as good Chaps, and welcome to redeem it. But if it be plain Gold or Silver, we &s;hall hardly &s;ee it again, unle&s;s we pay the Worth of it. Some Years ago, it is true, a Man might, for half a Piece, have fetch'd back a Snuff-Box that weigh'd twenty or thirty Shillings: But this was in the Infancy of the E&s;tabli&s;hment. Now they are grown wi&s;er, and calculate exactly
<PB N="4" REF="18">
what &s;uch a Thing will melt down for: To offer le&s;s is thought unrea&s;onable; and un|le&s;s Mr. <HI>Thief-catcher</HI> &s;tands your Friend in|deed, if you have it, you will &s;eldom &s;ave any Thing but the Fa&s;hion. If in this Place you can hear no Tidings of your Goods, it is counted a Sign, that they are in the Hands of irregular Practitioners, that &s;teal without Permi&s;&s;ion of the Board. In this Ca&s;e we im|mediately put in an Adverti&s;ement in &s;ome News-Paper or other, with a Promi&s;e, that &s;uch a Reward will be given, and no Que&s;tions asked. I own, that in the Printing of the&s;e &s;hort Epi&s;tles there is no manner of Harm, if we ab&s;tract the Act it&s;elf from the Concern the Publick has in it. The Tenor of them is rather benevolent than injurious: And a Panegyri&s;t on the pre&s;ent Times might ju&s;tly &s;ay of them, That in no Performances the true Spirit of Chri&s;tianity was &s;o con&s;pi|cuous as in the&s;e: That they were not only free from Calumny and ill Language, but likewi&s;e &s;o void of Reproach, that &s;peaking to a Thief, we never call'd him &s;o in tho&s;e charitable Addre&s;&s;es: That in them the very Catalogues of Injuries receiv'd, were penn'd with as little Heat, or Re&s;entment, as ever Trade&s;man &s;hew'd in a Bill of Parcels direct|ed to his be&s;t Cu&s;tomer: That here we are &s;o far from hating our Enemy, that we prof|fer him a Recompence for his Trouble, if he will conde&s;cend to let us have our own
<PB N="5" REF="19">
again; and leaving all Revenge to God, to &s;hew that we are willing to forgive and for|get, we con&s;ult, in the mo&s;t effectual Manner, the Safety of a Per&s;on that de&s;erves Hanging for the Wrong he has done us. Yet, not|with&s;tanding the kind Con&s;tructions that may be put on the&s;e Civil Offers, they all tend to the <HI>Compounding of Felony,</HI> and are the Oc|ca&s;ion of a double Mi&s;chief: They invite the Indigent and Lazy to pick Pockets, and render the Negligent more carele&s;s than pro|bably they would be, was this Practice abo|li&s;h'd. A Pocket-Book, or Memorandum, may be &s;tole from a Man that is of va&s;t Con|cern to him, and yet of no U&s;e but to the Owner: If this be taken by a regular Thief, a li&s;ted Pilferer, it is ea&s;ily recover'd for a &s;mall Reward. I don't &s;uppo&s;e any one &s;o &s;illy, that therefore he would go to Places, and into Companies, on Purpo&s;e to have his Pocket pick'd; but I can't help thinking, that if tho&s;e Things were never to be heard of again, and the Lo&s;s irretrievable, many young Rakes, and other loo&s;e Reprobates, would be under greater Apprehen&s;ions, and more upon their Guard, at lea&s;t when they had &s;uch a Charge about them, than the Ge|nerality of them now are. And again, if no|thing could be made of Letters, Papers, and Things of that Nature, &s;uch as have no known Worth, and are not readily turned into Mo|ney, the numbers of Whores and Rogues,
<PB N="6" REF="20">
young and old, that are employ'd in the Di|ving Trade, would decrea&s;e con&s;iderably; many of them, from a Principle of Prudence, refu&s;ing to meddle with any Thing el&s;e. For as on mo&s;t of the Things now &s;poke of, no real Value can be &s;et, the Puni&s;hment would be incon&s;iderable, if any, &s;hould the Things be found upon them, or them&s;elves be taken in the Fact. Mo&s;t Men will agree to all this, whil&s;t unconcern'd; but when private Intere&s;t is touch'd, it &s;oon &s;tifles the&s;e Con|&s;iderations. I &s;hould be a Fool, &s;ays one, when a Thing of Value is &s;tolen from me, not to get it back, if I can, for a Trifle. If I lo&s;e a Sword, or a Watch, I mu&s;t have a|nother; and to &s;ave the Fa&s;hion in the&s;e Things is con&s;iderable: It is better to lo&s;e the Half than the Whole. I have nothing to do with the Thief, &s;ays another, if I have my own again, it is all I want: What Good would it do to me to have a poor Fellow hang'd? A Third, more compa&s;&s;ionate, will tell us, that if he knew the Thief, he would not meddle with him; and that he would lo&s;e ten times the Value of what has been taken from him, rather than be the Occa|&s;ion of a Man's Death. To the&s;e I reply, that the Legi&s;lators &s;eem to have known how the Generality of Men would argue, and what Excu&s;es they would make; they had an Eye on the Frailty of our Nature; con&s;ider'd, that all Pro&s;ecutions are trouble|&s;ome,
<PB N="7" REF="21">
and often very expen&s;ive; that mo&s;t Men preferred their own Intere&s;t, their Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, to any Regard of the Pub|lick; and therefore they provided again&s;t our Pa&s;&s;ions with &s;o much Severity. <HI>Com|pounding of Felony</HI> is not prohibited under a &s;mall Penalty, or attoned for by a little Fine; it is next to Felony; and the mo&s;t credi|table Citizen, that is convicted of it, cea&s;es to be an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>The Offence in our Law is call'd THEFT|BOTE; of which my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Coke</HI> &s;ays, <Q>That it is an Offence beyond Mi&s;pri|&s;ion of Felony; for that is only a bare Concealment of his bare Knowledge: But that it is THEFTBOTE when the Owner not only knows of the Felony, but takes of the Thief his Goods again, or Amends for the &s;ame to favour or maintain him, that is, not to pro&s;ecute him, to the Intent he may e&s;cape. The Puni&s;h|ment of THEFTBOTE is Ran&s;om and Impri&s;onment.</Q> THEFTBOTE (as de&s;cri|bed by Act of Parliament) <HI>e&s;t emenda furti capta ab&s;que con&s;ideratione curiae domini re|gis.</HI> Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> in his <HI>Pleas of the Crown,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>That THEFTBOTE is more than a bare Mi&s;pri&s;ion of Felony, and is, where the Owner doth not only know the Felony, but takes his Goods again, or o|ther Amends, not to pro&s;ecute.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="22">
This Rigour of the Legi&s;lature is a full Demon&s;tration, that they thought it a Crime of the mo&s;t pernicious Con&s;equence to the Society; yet it is become familiar to us; and our Remi&s;sne&s;s in &s;everal Matters, rela|ting to Felons, is not to be parallell'd in any other civiliz'd Nation. That Rogues &s;hould be indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;pers'd throughout the Ci|ty and Suburbs; that different Hours and Stations &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd among them, and regular Books kept of &s;tollen Goods; that the Superintendent in this hopeful Oecono|my &s;hould almo&s;t every Se&s;&s;ions, for a Re|ward, betray, pro&s;ecute, and hang one or more of this his Acquaintance, and at the &s;ame Time keep on his Corre&s;pondence a|mong&s;t the Survivors, whom, one after ano|ther, he &s;ends all to their Triangular Home; that Magi&s;trates &s;hould not only know and &s;ee this, but likewi&s;e continue to make u&s;e of &s;uch a Per&s;on for an Evidence, and in a manner own that they are beholden to him in the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice; That, I &s;ay, all the&s;e Things &s;hould be Facts, is &s;omething very extraordinary, in the Prin|cipal City, and the Home Management of a Kingdom, &s;o formidable abroad, and of &s;uch Moment in the Balance of <HI>Europe,</HI> as that of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief that one Man can do as a Thief, is a very Trifle to what he may be the Occa&s;ion of, as an Agent or Concealer of Fe|lons.
<PB N="9" REF="23">
The longer this Practice continues, the more the Number of Rogues mu&s;t hourly encrea&s;e; and therefore it is high Time that regular Book-keeping of &s;tolen Goods &s;hould cea&s;e, and that all Gangs and Knots of Thieves &s;hould be broke and de&s;troy'd as much as is po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, none of them &s;uffer'd to form them&s;elves into Societies that are un|der Di&s;cipline, and act by Order of a Superi|or. It is highly criminal in any Man, for Lucre, to connive at a Piece of Felony which he could have hinder'd: But a profe&s;s'd Thief-Catcher, above all, ought to be &s;evere|ly puni&s;h'd, if it can be proved that he has &s;uffer'd a known Rogue to go on in his Vil|lany, tho' but one Day, after it was in his Power to apprehend and convict him, more e&s;pecially if it appears that he was a Sharer in the Profit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the ill Con&s;equences of</HI> THEFTBOTE, <HI>and the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Felons in</HI> Newgate.</HEAD>
<P>OFTEN, when I have &s;poke again&s;t <HI>Theft|bote,</HI> after the &s;ame manner as now I have been writing, I have heard Men of Worth and good Sen&s;e come into my Sentiments, who yet, after all, would tell me, That if I
<PB N="10" REF="24">
had lo&s;t any Thing my&s;elf, they believ'd that I would be glad to have it again with as little Co&s;t and Trouble as I could. This I never deni|ed, and am &s;till willing to own. We are all par|tial and unfit Judges in our own Cau&s;e; but the mo&s;t that can be made of this, is, That in that Ca&s;e neither I nor any Body el&s;e, that has had any Thing &s;tolen from him, ought to be con&s;ulted about the Matter: We are ill qualified, and therefore incapable of determi|ning any Thing rightly concerning it. I have another Rea&s;on why this ought to be referred rather to tho&s;e who never lo&s;t any Thing by Thieves and Pilferers, than others who have been Sufferers that Way: Rogues, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s true, have a thou&s;and Stratagems, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> may be very careful, and yet have his Pocket pick'd, if ever he appears in the Street, or a Crowd: Yet, if we divide Man|kind into two Cla&s;&s;es, that the one will be more exempt from tho&s;e Misfortunes than the other, is undeniable. A Man, who is always upon his Guard in the Streets, and &s;u&s;pects all Crowds; that is temperate in his Liquor; avoids, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, un&s;ea&s;onable Hours; never gives Ear to Night-walkers; a Man that abroad is always watchful over him&s;elf, and every Thing about him, and at home takes Care of his Doors and Bolts, his Shutters, Locks, and Bars; &s;uch a one, I &s;ay, is in le&s;s Danger than others, who are un|thinking, and never mind what Companies

they thru&s;t them&s;elves into; or &s;uch as will be drunk, go home late in the dark unat|tended, and &s;cruple not to talk and conver&s;e with lewd Women, as they meet them; or that are carele&s;s of them&s;elves as well as of the &s;ecuring and fa&s;tening of their Hou&s;es. It is evident then which Cla&s;s would yield the mo&s;t proper Judges; whom if it was left to, I don't que&s;tion but the &s;ober, careful, and wi&s;er Part of the Nation would agree, that the Practice in vogue, and Method made u&s;e of to recover &s;tolen Goods, even tho' there was no expre&s;s Law again&s;t it, is, on many Accounts, mi&s;chievous to the Publick, and vi&s;ibly de&s;tructive to the Intere&s;t of hone&s;t Property, and our Security in the Enjoy|ment of it.</P>
<P>There is no greater Encouragement for Men to follow any Labour or Handicraft, than that they are paid as &s;oon as they have done their Work, without any further Trou|ble. It is from &s;uch a Con&s;ideration as this, that to encrea&s;e the publick Security, the Law not only puni&s;hes Stealing, but likewi&s;e makes it Felony, knowingly to buy &s;tolen Goods; and moreover perpetuates hone&s;t Property, and renders the Right of it inalienable from the injured Owner, who &s;eizes his Goods in what Hands &s;oever he finds them. The&s;e two additional Precautions are of admirable U&s;e in hampering common Villains, and &s;trengthening the Law again&s;t Theft. From
<PB N="12" REF="26">
the fir&s;t, a Rogue, after he has made him|&s;elf liable to be hang'd, may be &s;till di&s;ap|pointed, and mi&s;s his chief Aim; for as Mo|ney is what he wants, if no Body will pur|cha&s;e what he offers, he is never the nearer. The Second makes that he is never &s;afe, tho' he is rid of the Goods, and the Money in his Pocket; for tho' they are gone through half a Dozen Hands, as &s;oon as the Right Owner lays Claim to the Things &s;tole, every one is oblig'd to di&s;cover where he had them; and by this Means it is &s;eldom difficult to find out the Thief, or the Receiver of &s;tolen Goods. To leap the&s;e two Barriers, and free him&s;elf at once of the Trouble there is in finding a &s;afe Purcha&s;er, and all Apprehen&s;i|ons of future Danger, a Rogue could not with or imagine any Thing more effectual than that he might lodge what he has &s;tole in the Hands of the Owner him&s;elf, and &s;o receive a Reward for his Pains, and, at the &s;ame Time, a Pardon for his Crime, of him, who&s;e Pro&s;ecution was the only Thing he had to fear. It is evident then, that the friendly Commerce, and amicable Negotia|tions, now in vogue, between Thieves and tho&s;e that are robb'd by them, are the great|e&s;t Encouragement of low Villany that can be invented, and as &s;ure a Way to keep up the Breed of Rogues, and promote the Inte|re&s;t of them, as either our Fi&s;hery or the Coal Trade are con&s;tant Nur&s;eries for Sailors.</P>

I am not ignorant, that in the pre&s;ent Con|juncture, as Ca&s;es might be &s;tated, it would be very har&s;h, and &s;eem to be the Height of Inju&s;tice, if we &s;hould hinder People from redeeming &s;tolen Goods on all Emergencies whatever. A Man may be vigilant and care|ful, and his Servants the &s;ame, and yet, their Eyes being one Moment turn'd from the Counter, a Shop-Book may be &s;natched, and carried off, perhaps, a Month before <HI>Chri&s;t|mas.</HI> This may put a Trade&s;man of good Bu&s;ine&s;s in great Di&s;tre&s;s: Mu&s;t he lo&s;e it?

In the mean time, I know very well what every Body would do in that Ca&s;e: But that the Whole &s;uffers by the Re|demption, I prove thus: Let us &s;ay, that this Year twelve Shop-Books are &s;tole, that are all recover'd for two or three Guineas a|piece got for them, and no Body puni&s;h'd. You may expect that next Year you will have forty or fifty &s;tole, and in a few Years nothing will be more common. And again, let us &s;uppo&s;e that la&s;t Year an hundred Shop-Books were &s;tole; but, by vertue of &s;ome effectual Law for that Purpo&s;e, not one redeemed. The Con&s;equence, in all Proba|bility, would be, that the next Year you would hardly have ten Shop-Books &s;tole; and if, thro' the &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of the Law, none of them likewi&s;e &s;hould be redeem'd, you would hear no more of that Practice.</P>

Be&s;ides, when a Man &s;teals what is of no Value but to me, and can have no other View than that I &s;hould redeem it, and be his Pay-Ma&s;ter my&s;elf, the Felony becomes, in a manner, a compound Action, in which, as &s;oon as I comply, I join with the Thief: And if we con&s;ider that the changing of Property from one Man to another, is &s;eldom of any Con&s;equence to the Publick, and that all the Mi&s;chief that can befal it from Theft, that is, the Lo&s;s of Goods that Way &s;u&s;tain'd by private Per&s;ons, con&s;i&s;ts in this, That tho&s;e who committed it, gain their Point, and come off with Impunity, let who will be the Thief, or the Receiver; if, I &s;ay, we con&s;ider the&s;e two Things, it will appear, that in the Ca&s;e I have mentioned, my&s;elf, who for my own Ends a&s;|&s;i&s;ted the Thief with Money, and &s;ecured him from Pro&s;ecution, had the greate&s;t Share in the Tran&s;action, and con&s;equently was, of the two, the mo&s;t injurious to the civil So|ciety. Without me the Rogue would not on|ly have been di&s;appointed, but likewi&s;e, whil&s;t he continued in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Thing &s;tole, remained in the perpetual Dread of being pro|&s;ecuted for what he never had any Benefit from; and it is not probable that a Man who had been twice &s;o &s;erved, would ever make &s;uch another Attempt.</P>

Experience teaches us of common Felons, and they will ea&s;ily find out, that un&s;ea&s;ona|ble Pity may prove the greate&s;t Cruelty. The oftner a young Rogue &s;teals with Impunity, the &s;ooner he'll be a thorough-paced Villain, that will venture on more hazardous Under|takings; and the more numerous the Exam|ples of &s;uch are, the more loo&s;e People will enter into the Fraternity, of which, whether it be great or &s;mall, very few ever arrive to a middle Age. Some are cunning enough never to be taken in a Fact; but no Subtlety can &s;ave them from the Impeachment of o|thers. A licens'd Practitioner may be skreen'd and protected &s;ome Years, if he &s;ticks to Di&s;|cipline, and pays the greate&s;t Part of his Ear|nings for his Security; but if he rides re&s;ty, and &s;quabbles about the Contribution requi|red of him, he is in a dangerous Way. It is po&s;&s;ible that a dextrous Youth may be e&s;teem|ed, and be a Favourite to the Superintendent a great while; but when he grows very no|torious, he is hunted like a Deer, and the Premium on his Head betrays him. He may baffle his Pro&s;ecutor, find a Flaw in an In|dictment, elude the Force of an Evidence, come off once or twice, be reprieved, break Goal, or be pardoned, the Gallows will be his Portion at la&s;t. The Wretch that is train'd up to &s;tealing, is the Property of the Hang|man: He can never entirely leave off his Trade: Many, after Tran&s;portation, have,

<P>From all which appears, what I undertook to prove, That Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s as to Pro&s;ecutions, occa&s;ion'd by the bare-faced Compo&s;itions of Felony, is one of the grand Cau&s;es of that lamentable Complaint, the Frequency of Ex|ecutions; and &s;hould we compare the Droves that are carried to <HI>Tyburn</HI> for Slaughter, with tho&s;e others that are &s;ent to <HI>Smithfield</HI> for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, we would find the modern Thief-Catcher &s;ub&s;ervient to the Executio|ner in the &s;ame Manner, as the wealthy Gra|zier is to the needy Butcher; and thatofthe Cattle in either Sen&s;e, few are kill'd by the one that were never cheri&s;h'd by the other.</P>
<P>I am now come to the &s;econd Cau&s;e, which is the Treatment Felons receive after they are taken, both in <HI>Newgate</HI> and their Journey from thence to the Gallows: Fir&s;t, It is wrong to &s;uffer &s;uch Numbers of them to be and conver&s;e together; for nothing but the utmo&s;t Corruption can be expected from a Company of forty or fifty People in a Pri&s;on, who, eve|ry one of them, &s;ingly con&s;ider'd, were all the wor&s;t of Thou&s;ands before they met. Se|condly, It is an Encouragement to Vice, that the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute of both Sexes, and gene|rally young People too, &s;hould live promi&s;|cuou&s;ly in the &s;ame Place, and have Acce&s;s to one another. For the re&s;t, the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s

of the Place is abominable, and there are no low Je&s;ts &s;o filthy, no Maxims &s;o de&s;tructive to good Manners, or Expre&s;&s;ions &s;o vile and prophane, but what are utter'd there with Applau&s;e, and repeated with Impunity. They eat and drink what they can purcha&s;e, every Body has Admittance to them, and they are debarr'd from nothing but going out. Their mo&s;t &s;erious Hours they &s;pend in mock Try|als, and in&s;tructing one another in cro&s;s Que|&s;tions, to confound Witne&s;&s;es; and all the Stratagems and Eva&s;ions that can be of Ser|vice, to elude the Charge that &s;hall be made again&s;t them; or el&s;e in reading Lectures on &s;ome Branch or other of their Profe&s;&s;ion, the various Arts and Methods of Stealing, or the Glory, as well as U&s;efulne&s;s of invincible Impudence on all offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive E|mergencies. As villainous Pawn-brokers, and all Receivers of &s;tolen Goods, have good Rea&s;ons to be liberal to tho&s;e they have dealt with, when in this Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o no Felons are here in Want, and reduced to the Allowance of the Pri&s;on, but Novices and &s;illy Creatures, that have the lea&s;t de&s;erved to be puni&s;h'd; whereas the Veteran Rogues, and &s;uch as have been great Traders, are well provided for. This keeps them up in Debauchery; and many, after Condemnation, per&s;i&s;t in their riotous Cour&s;es, and pampering their Bodies, whil&s;t the Care that is taken of their Souls is very mean.

<P>WHEN the Day of Execution is come, among extraordinary Sinners, and Per|&s;ons condemned for their Crimes, who have but that Morning to live, one would expect a deep Sen&s;e of Sorrow, with all the Signs of a thorough Contrition, and the utmo&s;t Concern; that either Silence, or a &s;ober Sad|ne&s;s, &s;hould prevail; and that all, who had any Bu&s;ine&s;s there, &s;hould be grave and &s;eri|ous, and behave them&s;elves, at lea&s;t, with common Decency, and a Deportment &s;uita|ble to the Occa&s;ion. But the very Rever&s;e is true. The horrid A&s;pects of Turnkeys and Gaolers, in Di&s;content and Hurry; the &s;harp and dreadful Looks of Rogues, that beg in Irons, but would rob you with greater Satisfaction, if they could; the Bellowings of half a dozen Names at a time, that are per|petually

made in the Enquiries after one ano|ther; the Variety of &s;trong Voices, that are heard, of howling in one Place, &s;colding and quarrelling in another, and loud Laughter in a third; the &s;ub&s;tantial Breakfa&s;ts that are made in the mid&s;t of all this; the Seas of Beer that are &s;will'd; the never-cea&s;ing Outcries for more; and the bawling An&s;wers of the Tap&s;ters as continual; the Quantity and Vari|eties of more entoxicating Liquors, that are &s;wallow'd in every Part of <HI>Newgate;</HI> the Im|pudence, and un&s;ea&s;onable Je&s;ts of tho&s;e, who admini&s;ter them; their black Hands, and Na&s;tine&s;s all over; all the&s;e, joined together, are a&s;toni&s;hing and terrible, without mention|ing the Oaths and Imprecations, that from every Corner are echo'd about, for Trifles; or the little, light, and general Squallor of the Gaol it&s;elf, accompany'd with the melancholy Noi&s;e of Fetters, differently &s;ounding, accor|ding to their Weight: But what is mo&s;t &s;hocking to a thinking Man, is, the Behavi|our of the Condemn'd, whom (for the great|e&s;t Part) you'll find, either drinking madly, or uttering the vile&s;t Ribaldry, and jeering others, that are le&s;s impenitent; whil&s;t the Ordinary bu&s;tles among them, and, &s;hifting from one to another, di&s;tributes Scraps of good Coun&s;el to unattentive Hearers; and near him, the Hangman, impatient to be gone, &s;wears at their Delays; and, as fa&s;t as he can, does his Part, in preparing them for their Journey.</P>

At la&s;t, out they &s;et; and with them a Tor|rent of Mob bur&s;ts thorough the Gate. A|mong&s;t the lower Rank, and working People, the idle&s;t, and &s;uch as are mo&s;t fond of ma|king Holidays, with Prentices and Journey|men to the meane&s;t Trades, are the mo&s;t ho|nourable Part of the&s;e floating Multitudes. All the re&s;t are wor&s;e. The Days being known before-hand, they are a Summons to all Thieves and Pickpockets, of both Sexes, to meet. Great Mobs are a Safeguard to one another, which makes the&s;e Days Jubilees, on which old Offenders, and all who dare not &s;hew their Heads on any other, venture out of their Holes; and they re&s;emble Free Marts, where there is an Amne&s;ty for all Outlaws. All the Way, from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> is one continued Fair, for Whores and Rogues of the meaner Sort. Here the mo&s;t abandon'd Rakehells may light on Wo|men as &s;hamele&s;s: Here Trollops, all in Rags, may pick up Sweethearts of the &s;ame Polite|ne&s;s: And there are none &s;o lewd, &s;o vile, or &s;o indigent, of either Sex, but at the Time and Place afore&s;aid, they may find a Para|mour. Where the Croud is the lea&s;t, which, among the Itinerants, is no where very thin, the Mob is the rude&s;t; and here, jo&s;tling one another, and kicking Dirt about, are the mo&s;t innocent Pa&s;times.

No modern Rabble can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t without their darling Cordial, the grand Pre&s;ervative of Sloth, <HI>Je|neva,</HI> that infallible Antidote again&s;t Care and frugal Reflexion; which, being repeated re|moves all Pain of &s;ober Thought, and in a little Time cures the tormenting Sen&s;e of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities. The Traders, who vent it among the Mob on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, are commonly the wor&s;t of both Sexes, but mo&s;t of them weather-beaten Fellows, that have mi&s;-&s;pent their Youth. Here &s;tands an old Sloven, in a Wig actually putrify'd, &s;queez'd up in a Corner, and recommends a Dram of it to the Goers-by: There another in Rags, with &s;everal Bottles in a Basket, &s;tirs about with it, where the Throng is the thinne&s;t, and tears his Throat with crying his Commodity; and further off, you may &s;ee the Head of a third, who has ventur'd in the Middle of the Current, and minds his Bu&s;ine&s;s, as he is fluc|tuating in the irregular Stream: Whil&s;t higher up, an old decrepit Woman &s;its dreaming with it on a Bulk; and over again&s;t her, in a Soldier's Coat, her termagant Daughter &s;ells the Sots-Comfort with great Di&s;patch. The intelligible Sounds, that are heard among them, are Oaths and vile Expre&s;&s;ions, with

Wi&s;hes of Damnation at every other Word, pronounced promi&s;cuou&s;ly again&s;t them&s;elves, or tho&s;e they &s;peak to, without the lea&s;t Al|teration in the Meaning.</P>
<P>As the&s;e undi&s;ciplined Armies have no par|ticular Enemies to encounter, but Cleanline&s;s and good Manners, &s;o nothing is more en|tertaining to them, than the dead Carca&s;&s;es of Dogs and Cats, or, for want of them, Rags, and all Trompery that is capable of imbibing Dirt. The&s;e, well trampled in Filth, and, if po&s;&s;ible, of the wor&s;t &s;ort, are, by the Ringleaders, flung as high and as far as a &s;trong Arm can carry them, and commonly directed where the Throng is the thicke&s;t: Whil&s;t the&s;e ill-boding Meteors are &s;hooting thro' the Air, the Joy and Satisfaction of the Beholders is vi&s;ible in every Countenance and Ge&s;ture; and more audibly expre&s;s'd by the great Shouts that accompany them in their Cour&s;e; and, as the Projectiles come nearer the Earth, are turn'd into loud Laughter, which is more or le&s;s violent in Proportion to the Mi&s;chief promis'd by the Fall. And to &s;ee a good Suit of Cloaths &s;poiled by this Piece of Gallantry, is the tip-top of their Di|ver&s;ion, which they &s;eldom go home with|out enjoying: For tho' no People in their Sen&s;es would venture among them on Foot, in any tolerable Dre&s;s, yet there are young Rakes of Fortune, who care not what they lavi&s;h, or de&s;troy: Of the&s;e the madde&s;t &s;ort

<P>Tho' before &s;etting out, the Pri&s;oners took care to &s;wallow what they could, to be drunk, and &s;tifle their Fear; yet the Courage that &s;trong Liquors can give, wears off, and the Way they have to go being con&s;iderable, they are in Danger of recovering, and, with|out repeating the Do&s;e, Sobriety would often overtake them: For this Rea&s;on they mu&s;t drink as they go; and the Cart &s;tops for that Purpo&s;e three or four, and &s;ometimes half a dozen Times, or more, before they come to their Journey's End.

If we con&s;ider, be&s;ides all this, the mean Equipages of the Sheriffs Officers, and the &s;crubby Hor|&s;es that compo&s;e the Cavalcade, the Irregu|larity of the March, and the Want of Order among all the Attendants, we &s;hall be forced to confe&s;s, that the&s;e Proce&s;&s;ions are very void of that decent Solemnity that would be required to make them awful.

I have no De&s;ign that &s;avours of Cruelty, or even Indecency, towards a hu|man Body; but &s;hall endeavour to demon|&s;trate, that the &s;uper&s;titious Reverence of the Vulgar for a Corp&s;e, even of a Malefactor, and the &s;trong Aver&s;ion they have again&s;t di&s;|&s;ecting them, are prejudicial to the Publick: For as Health and &s;ound Limbs are the mo&s;t de&s;irable of all Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o we ought to encourage the Improvement of Phy|&s;ick and Surgery, wherever it is in our Pow|er. The Knowledge of Anatomy is in&s;epa|rable from the Studies of either; and it is al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to under&s;tand the In&s;ide of our Bodies, without having &s;een &s;e|veral of them skilfully di&s;&s;ected. Kings and Princes are open'd, and have their Hearts and Bowels taken out, and embalm'd. It is not then Ignominious, much le&s;s offen&s;ive to the dead Body, which may be interred with as

much Decency, after Di&s;&s;ection, as if it never had been touch'd. But &s;uppo&s;e that many of our common Thieves were not to be bu|ried at all, and &s;ome of them made Skeletons; and that &s;everal Parts of others, variou&s;ly prepared, &s;hould be pre&s;erved for the In&s;tru|ction of Students? What if it was a Di&s;grace to the &s;urviving Relations of tho&s;e, who had Lectures read upon their Bodies, and were made u&s;e of for Anatomical Preparations? The Di&s;honour would &s;eldom reach beyond the Scum of the People; and to be di&s;&s;ected, can never be a greater Scandal than being hanged. The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Leyden</HI> in <HI>Hol|land</HI> have a Power given them by the Le|gi&s;lature to demand, for this Purpo&s;e, the Bodies of ordinary Rogues executed within that Province; but, with us, it is the gene|ral Complaint of all Profe&s;&s;ors of Anatomy, that they can get none to di&s;&s;ect: Where then &s;hall we find a readier Supply; and what Degree of People are fitter for it than tho&s;e I have named? When Per&s;ons of no Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their own, that have &s;lipp'd no Opportunity of wronging whomever they could, die without Re&s;titution, indebted to the Publick, ought not the injur'd Publick to have a Title to, and the Di&s;po&s;al of, what the others have left?

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of the wrong Judgments that are pa&s;s'd on the dying Behaviour of Malefactors.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING fini&s;h'd the Picture I propo|&s;ed to draw of modern Executions, and the Crowds that u&s;ually attend them, I &s;hall make &s;ome Remarks on the Judgments that are commonly pa&s;s'd on the dying Behaviour of our ordinary Felons. In a rich and po|tent Kingdom, where worldly Glory is not in Contempt, and to think meanly of our &s;elves &s;eldom taught by Example, whatever it may be by Precept, nothing is counted more provoking, or le&s;s to be born with Pa|tience, than to be called a Coward. The vile&s;t Rogues, and mo&s;t de&s;picable Villains, may own a thou&s;and Crimes, and often brag of the mo&s;t abominable Actions; but there is &s;carce one, who will confe&s;s that he has no Courage. Our general E&s;teem for Va|lour,
<PB N="29" REF="43">
which is demon&s;trable from what I have &s;aid, as it is of great U&s;e to a warlike Nati|on, is very commendable; and Fortitude ought ever to keep its Place among&s;t the Cardinal Virtues: But the Notions which the Vulgar have of Courage, as well as Honour and Shame, are full of dangerous Errors. Compliments, as well as Reproaches, when ill applied, are often the Cau&s;es of great Mi&s;|chief; and I am per&s;uaded, that the Perver&s;e|ne&s;s of Opinion now reigning among&s;t us, both in applauding and di&s;commending the Con|duct of Criminals in their la&s;t Hours, is an acce&s;&s;ary Evil, that very much contributes to what is the Subject of our grand Complaint, the Frequency of Executions. To explain my &s;elf on this Matter in the cleare&s;t Man|ner I am able, I beg leave to begin with it from the Bottom.</P>
<P>In all living Creatures, that fall under our Sen&s;es, we perceive an In&s;tinct of Self-Pre|&s;ervation; and the more &s;en&s;ible they are, the greater Aver&s;ion they di&s;cover to the Di&s;|&s;olution of their Being. Man, the mo&s;t per|fect of them, &s;ets an ine&s;timable Value on Life, and knows no Fear equal to the Hor|ror he has again&s;t Death. This is to be un|der&s;tood only of Man, in the State of Nature, before he has made Reflections on him&s;elf, and what he &s;ees of the Creation; but when, after that his Rea&s;on demon&s;trates to him that there mu&s;t have been a fir&s;t Cau&s;e; that the
<PB N="30" REF="44">
World is govern'd by an intelligent Being; that him&s;elf, a Compound of Soul and Body, is indebted to that Being for all he enjoys, and that there is a &s;trong Probability of a Life after this: When, moreover, he con&s;iders him&s;elf as incorporated in a Community of va&s;t Numbers, that all together make one Bo|dy politick, the Welfare of which he finds univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, as a Concern &s;uperior to all others: When, I &s;ay, he finds and re|flects on all this, he plainly &s;ees, that the Fear of Death, mu&s;t, on many Accounts, be pre|judicial to the publick Good and common Se|curity, in which he has a Share. It is a Vir|tue then to conquer it; and if we in&s;pect into the early Oeconomy of all Nations, we &s;hall find, that the mo&s;t powerful Motives made u&s;e of to induce Man to le&s;&s;en this Fear, and moderate the Fondne&s;s which Na|ture has given us of Life, had their Origin from Religion, or a publick Spirit; that is, in other Words, from a Repre&s;entation of his Duty either to God or his Country. Thus holy Martyrs have &s;uffer'd with Fortitude for their Faith, and, in Confidence of eternal Happine&s;s, ha&s;ten'd to Death with Alacrity, and even rejoiced in the Mid&s;t of Flames. And thus there have been valiant Men, in all Ages, that have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the greate&s;t Hazards, in Defence of their Laws and Liberties, and, animated by a zealous Love for their Country, &s;acrific'd their Lives
<PB N="31" REF="45">
to the publick Welfare. As Men of this Sort have every where de&s;ervedly gained the general Applau&s;e, and the Virtue they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of has been honoured by the Name of Courage; &s;o, on the contrary, the Fearful and Pu&s;illanimous, that ever prefer their own Safety to all other Con&s;iderations, and are therefore never to be relied upon, are as ju&s;tly de&s;pis'd, and the ignominious Word, by which we reproach the Vice that en&s;laves them, is Cowardice.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid it is evident, that the original Rea&s;on why Courage is general|ly e&s;teemed, is, becau&s;e it is taken for grant|ed, that both the Principle we act from, and the End we labour for in conquering our Fears, are prai&s;e-worthy, and have a vi&s;ible Tendency, either to the Good of others, or our own &s;piritual Felicity. Nothing, there|fore, is more unju&s;t, than that we &s;hould con|tinue our E&s;teem for Valour when it degene|rates, and both the Motive Men &s;et out with, and the Scope they aim at, are palpably de|&s;tructive. Anger, Pride, Envy, and &s;everal other Pa&s;&s;ions, are capable of &s;ubduing Fear. But, as the&s;e Principles are evil in them&s;elves, &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible that the End to be obtain'd by them &s;hould be commendable. What perver&s;e and mi&s;erable Judges are we then, that applaud a Per&s;on's Intrepidity in fighting a Duel, when in the Act it&s;elf, we &s;ee him willfully violate the Laws of God and Man?
<PB N="32" REF="46">
But &s;hould human Honour here break in upon me, and my Rea&s;oning, how right &s;o|ever, be overpower'd by the irre&s;i&s;table Cla|mour of the fa&s;hionable World, what can be &s;aid for the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Intimidity of a vulgar Rogue, who not only profe&s;&s;es an utter Di&s;|regard to Honour and Con&s;cience, but has likewi&s;e, at his fir&s;t Setting out, as a Preli|minary to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, di&s;claim'd all Preten|ces to common Hone&s;ty? Why &s;hould we delight in the Intrepidity, tho' it was real, of a Villain in his Impiety? Why &s;hould Chri|&s;tians be plea&s;ed to &s;ee a great Sinner give up his Gho&s;t impenitent; or imagine that he dies bravely, becau&s;e he bids Defiance to Heaven, and boldly plunges him&s;elf into an Aby&s;s of eternal Mi&s;ery? Yet nothing is more common among&s;t us: And the further a Man is removed from Repentance, nay, the more void he &s;eems to be of all Religion, and the le&s;s Concern he di&s;covers for Futu|rity, the more he is admired by our &s;prightly People: Whereas, he who &s;hews but the lea&s;t Sorrow for his Sins, or, by his Tears, or Di&s;mality of Ge&s;tures, lets us know that he is under Apprehen&s;ions of the divine Wrath, is a weak &s;illy Creature, not worth looking at: And he only, in the Opinion of many, dies like a Man, who, in reality, goes off mo&s;t like a Brute. But &s;ome of my Readers, per|haps, will have nothing to do with Chri&s;tia|nity. Suppo&s;e, then, we lay by that Con&s;i|deration;
<PB N="33" REF="47">
I grant, that to &s;ubdue the Terrors of Death is a manife&s;t Token of Intrepidity, and promi&s;e to pay Homage to true Courage where&s;oever I can meet with it; only let us not be impo&s;ed upon, but try the Valour of this undaunted Hero, whether it be genuine. No Man can conquer the Fear of Death, but by &s;omething &s;uperior to it: What is the Power that &s;upports him in the Conflict, and what Principle does he act from? It is not his Innocence, for his Guilt is publick, and his Crimes are proved upon him. It is not Zeal for Religion, nor the Love of his Country: He pretends to neither. Yet it mu&s;t be &s;ome mighty Principle of va&s;t Force and Ef|ficacy; for if he acts con&s;i&s;tently, he de&s;pi&s;es not only Death, but the Wrath of Omnipo|tence, and a Puni&s;hment ju&s;t at Hand, that &s;hall be everla&s;ting. Will you &s;ay that he firmly believes that there is no God, nor Life after this, and that Man is wholly mortal? Suppo&s;e it; that's no Support again&s;t Death it&s;elf: But look narrowly into him, and you will alter your Opinion, even as to that. The Enthu&s;ia&s;m of Athei&s;ts has other Symp|toms; deplorable as it is, the Appearance of it is more &s;edate, and they make &s;ome Pre|tences to Rea&s;oning: But what Probability is there, that a poor Ra&s;cal, who was brought up in Ignorance, and perhaps cannot read, one who never troubled his Head with think|ing, much le&s;s with thinking on ab&s;tru&s;e Mat|ters,
<PB N="34" REF="48">
and Metaphy&s;icks, &s;hould &s;o far lo&s;e him|&s;elf in the Mazes of Philo&s;ophy, as to be|come a &s;peculative Athei&s;t.</P>
<P>Since, then, we can find no Principle from which it is po&s;&s;ible a common Villain &s;hould derive his Undauntedne&s;s, it is evident that what we &s;ee is &s;purious, and the Bravery we admire only counterfeited, and fal&s;e at Bot|tom. The Terror of Death inwardly excru|ciates him; But his Fear of &s;hewing this, of being called a Coward, and laugh'd at by his Companions, has &s;ome Command over his outward Appearance; therefore, (not to be found out,) &s;ometimes he &s;wears or &s;coffs at Religion; at others he mixes forc'd Laugh|ter with the vile&s;t Language, and trys all the Strength of Brutality to keep down a &s;trug|gling Con&s;cience, and appear more athei&s;tical and obdurate than, to his Sorrow, he feels him&s;elf to be. But his Impudence would &s;oon fail him, and his inexhau&s;tible Stock be but a weak Match for the Agonies he &s;uffers, if he took not Refuge in &s;trong Liquors. The&s;e are his only Support, and Drunkenne&s;s the Cau&s;e of his Intrepidity. Should I be told, that in many of them no Signs are &s;een ei|ther of Fear or Ebriety, it would be of no Force again&s;t my A&s;&s;ertion: As great Fear &s;inks, &s;o hard Drinking rai&s;es the Spirits: They are two Enemies, that, when equally match'd, may, by mutual Conflict, ea&s;ily di&s;arm and hinder the Operations of each other. Let a

curious Ob&s;erver mind the continual Chang|es of the Pri&s;oner's un&s;ettled Behaviour, the wild Manner of his Actions, and, above all, the greedy Ha&s;te, with which he throws down every Thing potable and intoxicating, and he will &s;oon perceive that our Sham-Hero drinks neither with Comfort, nor for Plea&s;ure, and &s;eems to expect no other Be|nefit from it, than that it may take away his Sen&s;es, and hinder him from thinking. Are not they fine Judges, who are impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch pu&s;illanimous Wretches, that are &s;o far from having conquer'd the Fear of Death, that they go out of the World without hav|ing ever dared one Moment &s;oberly to think of it; and of whom it can only be &s;aid, that they died hard and unmov'd, becau&s;e they were &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and with the Courage of a Stone &s;uffer'd them&s;elves, without Thought, to drop into Eternity?</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief that the&s;e Patterns of Impe|nitence, together with the Applau&s;e that is given them, mu&s;t produce in a va&s;t and opu|lent City, will appear from the following Con|&s;ideration. It is nece&s;&s;ary to the publick Peace and Security, that Burglary, Robbing in the Streets, or on the Highway, and all tho&s;e Crimes where Violence is mix'd with Inju&s;tice, &s;hould be capitally puni&s;h'd: But con&s;idering on the one hand, how much more prone Men are to Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, than they are to Indu&s;try and Labour; and,
<PB N="36" REF="50">
on the other, the Generality of human Wants, and the unequal Di&s;tributions of Fortune to &s;upply them, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that where Men are without Shame and Educati|on, and con&s;equently not affected with the Ties either of Honour or Religion, Poverty it&s;elf is a &s;trong Temptation to Thieving, when Opportunities offer. The greate&s;t Cha|rity, therefore, and Compa&s;&s;ion we can &s;hew to our Fellow-Creatures, is an extraordinary Severity, and never-cea&s;ing Watchfulne&s;s in a Government again&s;t the fir&s;t Approaches of Di&s;hone&s;ty. It is with this View that the Provi&s;ion of the Legi&s;lature, that &s;uch Offen|ders &s;hould be puni&s;h'd with Death, is to be vindicated; tho' the Puni&s;hment is greater than the Laws, framed by God him&s;elf for the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Commonwealth, inflicted; or what natural Ju&s;tice, proportioning the Pu|ni&s;hment to the Crime, &s;eems to require: For it is not the Death of tho&s;e poor Souls that is chiefly aim'd at in Executions, but the Terror we would have it &s;trike in others of the &s;ame loo&s;e Principles: And, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the&s;e Executions are little better than Barbarity, and &s;porting away the Lives of the indigent Vulgar, if tho&s;e valuable Sacrifices we are obliged to make to the publick Safe|ty, are render'd in&s;ignificant. If no Remedy can be found for the&s;e Evils, it would be bet|ter that Malefactors &s;hould be put to Death in private; for our publick Executions are

It would not be a very great Expence (where Chimneys, convenient Windows, Order, and Beauty would be out of the Que&s;tion:) to build an hundred &s;mall Rooms, perhaps, of twelve Foot Square, that would be &s;trong, beyond the Po&s;&s;ibility of being forced by na|ked Hands; and, to prevent all Hopes of breaking Goal, I would have it a Cu&s;tom made, to &s;earch, &s;u&s;pected or not, all Pri&s;on|ers, and the Places they are in, every Night before Bed-time. The Rooms I &s;peak of, I would rather have ob&s;cure, than otherwi&s;e; and the &s;mall Light they had, far beyond Reach. They &s;hould all have &s;uch Conveni|encies, that tho&s;e, who were &s;hut up in them, &s;hould, during their Stay, have no Occa&s;ion to &s;tir out of them on any Account.

inacce&s;&s;ible to all but a &s;ober Keeper, to take Care of them, and a Clergyman, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in Spirituals. And here I beg leave to ob|&s;erve, that Men of Reputation, who live in Credit, and by their Learning, or exemplary Lives, have acquired the Publick E&s;teem, are fitter for this Task, than others of &s;mall Parts, and no Repute; that, labouring under nar|row Circum&s;tances, for a poor Salary, and &s;ome mi&s;erable Perqui&s;ites, take upon them this weighty Province, as a Livelihood and Bu&s;ine&s;s, to be con&s;tantly follow'd. The more Re&s;pect and Reverence are paid to Divines, and the higher their Dignity is, the greater Opportunity they have of making them&s;elves &s;erviceable in every Branch of their Function, but more e&s;pecially that Part of it now under Con&s;ideration. In other Prote&s;tant Coun|tries, beyond Sea, the Mini&s;ters of the Na|tional Church perform this Office, either by Turns, or as the Criminal, and &s;ometimes the Magi&s;trate, de&s;ire it.

<P>The greater Provi&s;ion we made for the Souls and future Happine&s;s of the&s;e &s;hort|liv'd Sinners, the le&s;s Indulgence we &s;hould have for their Bodies and &s;en&s;ual Appetites: And I would have it &s;trictly ob&s;erved, that from the Moment their Death was fixed, 'till their Execution, they &s;hould receive nothing for Su&s;tenance but Bread and Water; and of either what they would. I would, moreover, have it enacted, That every Year a certain num|ber of dead Bodies, not under &s;ix, &s;hould be allowed to Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, for Ana|tomical U&s;es, not to be made choice of till after Death, in &s;uch a Manner, that no Fe|lon could be &s;ure this would not be his Lot.</P>
<P>If they &s;hould complain, that the mi&s;erable Diet they were confined to, was a Severity that di&s;turbed their Thoughts, and hinder'd their Devotion, it would be a Sign, that their Minds were not yet turned the right Way: But this Grievance, a &s;hort Time and Nece&s;|&s;ity will never fail to cure. The har&s;her that Article may &s;eem, the more Efficacy it would be of, in deterring Rogues from Mi&s;chief: For I do not doubt but mo&s;t of them would look upon the whol&s;ome Regulations in Pri|&s;on here mentioned, as the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Part of the Puni&s;hment they were to &s;uffer; though, I confe&s;s, that what I have in View bythis low Diet, chiefly regards the eternal

after more &s;uitable Diver&s;ions. The Ab&s;ence of &s;o many Rake-hells, that only take delight in Mi&s;chief, would render the&s;e Tragedies more &s;olemn, and, at the &s;ame Time, make room for Spectators of a better Sort, and le&s;|&s;er Sinners, on whom, in all Probability, they would have a more de&s;irable Effect. It is not to be expre&s;s'd, what la&s;ting and u&s;eful Im|pre&s;&s;ions &s;uch Shews would make: Many that are con&s;cious of their Frailty, and the &s;mall Power they have of conquering their Pa&s;&s;ions, would take an Opportunity from them of adoring the divine Mercy, for ha|ving pre&s;erved them hitherto from falling into &s;uch Crimes; even the Voluptuous, that in the Enjoyment of Youth and Vigour, are ena|mour'd with Life for the &s;ake of Plea&s;ure, would be &s;tartled at them, and thank God that this was not their Ca&s;e; and &s;everal by the Fear of Death only, become more &s;erious and reflecting.</P>
<P>Thus much we &s;hould gain, at lea&s;t, in Behalf of Religion, from every Execution, even of the mo&s;t &s;orry Felons, who, void of Sen&s;e and Goodne&s;s, only grieve becau&s;e they are to die, and go they know not where: But it is more than probable, that &s;ome of them would become good Chri&s;tians, and make exemplary Ends. When the Condemn'd &s;hould, in every Re&s;pect, receive the Treat|ment I have requir'd, and by this Means, un|di&s;turb'd by earthly Cares, have Lei&s;ure, in
<PB N="44" REF="58">
&s;ober Sadne&s;s, to review their pa&s;t Life, and examine into the Multitude, as well as Enor|mity of their Offences; then, after thorough Contrition, and an open Confe&s;&s;ion in Behalf of Ju&s;tice, animated by Faith, betake to con|&s;tant Prayer; we ought to believe that thus exerting them&s;elves in the Work of Salvati|on, by the good Guidance of able Divines, and their own unwearied Endeavours, many of them would find Favour in the Sight of the Almighty; and that &s;everal, even as they went to Death, would be regenerated, and comforted from above with a &s;trong A&s;&s;u|rance of Forgivene&s;s. What a vi&s;ible Alte|ration would it not make in them, when they &s;hould perceive their Spirits, that the Moment before were overwhelm'd with Grief, or fill'd with black De&s;pair, cheri&s;h'd and enlighten'd by the powerful Beams of heavenly Grace and Clemency: Tran&s;ported with the Pro&s;pect of approaching Bli&s;s they then would wi&s;h to die, and rejoice that they &s;hould be made Examples to frighten Evil|doers from their Ways.</P>
<P>But when they &s;hould con&s;ider, what Acts of Devotion and unfeigned Piety, what Works of &s;uperlative Charity would be nece&s;&s;ary, if they were to live, to atone for the heinous Crimes and manifold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions they had been guilty of again&s;t God and their Neigh|bour, how would it rouze their Souls, and how eager would it not render them, in the
<PB N="45" REF="59">
mo&s;t profitable Manner, to &s;pend the &s;mall Remains of Life! Sometimes they would de|ter the wicked and in the &s;ame Breath &s;oli|cite Heaven for their Conver&s;ion: At others, rea&s;oning from the Changes they had expe|rienced within, they would combat Impiety with Vehemence, and conjure Unbelievers no longer to doubt of an everla&s;ting Futurity: They would paint to them, in the &s;tronge&s;t Colours, the Horrors they had felt from an accu&s;ing Con&s;cience, and the Aby&s;s of Mi|&s;ery they had been plunged in, whil&s;t yet la|bouring under the dire Reflection on eternal Vengeance; And thus, mixing fervent Pray|ers with &s;trenuous Exhortation, they would employ the few Moments, that were left them, in Exerci&s;es intirely &s;piritual and holy.</P>
<P>How &s;uch Conver&s;ions would affect the Minds of all that &s;aw or heard them, cannot be better imagin'd than by examining our &s;elves. When we had &s;een an half-&s;tarv'd Wretch, that look'd like Death, come &s;hive|ring from his Pri&s;on, and hardly able to &s;peak or &s;tand, get with Difficulty on the &s;low uncomfortable Carriage; where, at the fir&s;t Rumbling of it, he &s;hould begin to weep, and as he went, di&s;&s;olve in Tears, and lo&s;e him&s;elf in incoherent Lamentations, it would move us to Compa&s;&s;ion. But with what A&s;toni&s;h|ment would it not fill us, to behold the &s;ame Creature, near the fatal Tree, become lively, glow with Zeal, and, in Strength of Voice

and Action, excell the mo&s;t vigorous Preach|ers! All this we might expect; and that tho&s;e of Wit and Genius, as certainly there are a|mong them, would often light on new and con|vincing Arguments to warn the Sinner: Nay, &s;ome of them prove &s;tupendious Orators, that would not only &s;pread Amazement all around them, but likewi&s;e find uncommon Ways to reach the Heart with Violence, and force Re|pentance on their Hearers. It is Stupidity to doubt the va&s;t U&s;e &s;uch Executions would be of, to compa&s;s Happine&s;s both here and here|after; and &s;hould we regard the fir&s;t only, it would be no Exaggeration to a&s;&s;ert, that one of them would be more &s;erviceable to the Peace and Security of this immen&s;e City, than a thou&s;and of tho&s;e that are now &s;o frequent among us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of</HI> TRANSPORTATION: <HI>And a Method to render that Puni&s;hment more effectual.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN I concluded the la&s;t, I thought not to have tired the Reader any long|er with the Subject of Malefactors: But it has been remon&s;tated to me &s;ince, that what I had wrote, would &s;eem very defective, and this Treati&s;e be, in reality, imperfect, if I &s;aid nothing of Tran&s;portation; which, for &s;ome Years la&s;t pa&s;t, on many Occa&s;ions, has been
<PB N="47" REF="61">
&s;ub&s;tituted, and inflicted in the room of ca|pital Puni&s;hment; and having, at the &s;ame Time, been furni&s;h'd with a Hint concerning this Affair, that may be of admirable U&s;e, I cannot forbear imparting it to the Publick. There is no doubt but the De&s;ign of Tran&s;|porting Felons, in&s;tead of hanging them, when their Crimes were not very enormous, was ju&s;t and commendable, and it was rea&s;onable to expect that it would have proved a pow|erful Remedy again&s;t the grand Evil I have all along complain'd of, and which has been &s;o often repeated. But our &s;ubtle Criminals have found out Means hitherto to render it ineffectual: Some have made their E&s;cape in the Voyage it&s;elf; others, condemn'd to this Puni&s;hment, never have been put on board; &s;everal have reach'd the Plantations, but been return'd again by the fir&s;t Shipping, and great Numbers have been come back before half their Time was expir'd. Tho&s;e that are for|ced to &s;tay, do very little Service them&s;elves, and &s;poil the other Slaves, teaching the <HI>Afri|cans</HI> more Villany and Mi&s;chief than ever they could have learn'd without the Examples and In&s;tructions of &s;uch <HI>Europeans.</HI> We have loud Complaints from all the I&s;lands, that we &s;end &s;uch Numbers, and they know not what to do with them. As they come from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and are to &s;erve <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, their Co|lour, as well as Country and Language, plead for them; and the Ma&s;ters that complain of
<PB N="48" REF="62">
them, are to blame them&s;elves for treating them with le&s;s Severity than they do the in|nocent, as well as unfortunate Blacks, and more remi&s;ly than they ought, if they con&s;i|der'd that the&s;e Country Men of theirs are &s;ent thither on purpo&s;e to work, and are con|demn'd to Hard Labour, as a Puni&s;hment for their Crimes. The mild U&s;age our Felons receive beyond Sea, and the many Examples of &s;uch as come back before their Time, with Impunity, have quite de&s;troy'd the End which Tran&s;portation was de&s;ign'd for. The Cri|minals have no dread again&s;t it, remain as they were them&s;elves, and do no Service to others.</P>
<P>To redre&s;s this, there is an Expedient that may immediately be put into practice, and is, to my thinking, every way unexceptiona|ble; for it would effectually prevent the re|turning of the Felons, make them &s;ervicea|ble in the mo&s;t extraordiary Manner, and, at the &s;ame Time, be terrible beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion. The U&s;e I would put them to is, the Redemption of Slaves, that in <HI>Morocco,</HI> as well as <HI>Tunis, Algiers,</HI> and other Places on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> groan under a mi|&s;erable Servitude. Should it be objected, that &s;uch abandon'd People would turn Mahome|tans, and our &s;elves become acce&s;&s;ary to their eternal Ruin, I would ask what Surety we had for tho&s;e that were there already. A|mong&s;t our Seafaring Men, the Practice of Piety is very &s;carce: Abundance of them
<PB N="49" REF="63">
lead very bad Lives, who yet, as to the Love of their Country, and the <HI>Meum &amp; Tuum,</HI> are very hone&s;t Fellows. There are not ma|ny that are well grounded in the Principles of their Religion, or would be capable of maintaining it again&s;t an Adver&s;ary of the lea&s;t Ability; and we are not certain, that under great Temptations, they would remain &s;tedfa&s;t to the Chri&s;tian Faith. The Danger then of Apo&s;tacy being the &s;ame in both, we mu&s;t be manife&s;tly the Gainers, when we change lazy cowardly Thieves, and incorrigi|ble Rogues for brave, laborious, and u&s;eful People. It would be no difficult Matter to enter into Negotiations with the &s;everal Pow|ers of <HI>Barbary</HI> for this Purpo&s;e; neither is it rea&s;onable to imagine, that they would &s;cruple to take our Felons on account of the bad Lives they had led, or refu&s;e any for their Impudence, Wickedne&s;s, or Aver&s;ion to Labour. They con&s;ider and manage their Slaves as we do our Cattle; and it is their Age, their Health, the Soundne&s;s of their Limbs, and their Strength, they examine into, with little Regard to their Temper or their Morals: They are ever watchful over them, without tru&s;ting to their Hone&s;ty, or expecting any vo|luntary Obedience from them. If bought Ser|vants are able, Ma&s;ters there have &s;ure Ways to make them work. They laugh at Stubbor|ne&s;s and refractory Spirits, and their &s;teady Se|verity is a &s;overeign Remedy again&s;t Sloth,
<PB N="50" REF="64">
and all other Failings of the Will: From all which it is highly probable, that a Barbarian would be glad to change an elderly hone&s;t Man, pretty well worn, and above Fifty, for a &s;tur|dy Hou&s;e-breaker of Five and twenty: And as to tho&s;e that might be pretty equal, as to Years and Abilities, what if we &s;hould give them three for two, or two for one? I am &s;ure we could be no Lo&s;ers. Tho&s;e likewi&s;e that are known to be in Quality &s;uperior to common Sailors, might be redeem'd by &s;till a greater Number of Felons; or, at the wor&s;t, they could be no Sufferers by the Ex|changes of the others.</P>
<P>What I am &s;peaking of, I confe&s;s would be a very &s;evere Puni&s;hment for Felony; but I cannot imagine, how we can think on the Rigour of it, without reflecting, at the &s;ame Time, on the Inhumanity we are guilty of in the &s;mall Concern we often &s;hew, for many Years, for the Captivity of tho&s;e who have de&s;erv'd no Puni&s;hment at all. The greater the Calamities are of that cruel Bon|dage, the more rea&s;onable it is, that the Guilty &s;hould &s;uffer it rather than the Inno|cent. It is unpardonable not to deliver from the Yoke of Infidels, when it is in our Pow|er, our Fellow Subjects, whom we have no Complaint again&s;t. When &s;ufficient Sums cannot be rais'd to redeem them with Mo|ney, what &s;hould hinder us from doing it at the Expence of Mi&s;creants, whom it is In|ju&s;tice
<PB N="51" REF="65">
not to puni&s;h, and who, out of Chains, cannot be otherwi&s;e than noxious to the Pub|lick? If this be duly weigh'd, I doubt not, but what, at fir&s;t, &s;eems to be the greate&s;t Objection to this Propo&s;al, would, on fur|ther Reflection, be found an unan&s;werable Argument why we &s;hould embrace it. There would likewi&s;e be room always, with fre&s;h Supplies of Felons, to relea&s;e tho&s;e, who might be cured, or, at lea&s;t, thought to have been &s;ufficiently puni&s;h'd; and, to prevent all Tricks and E&s;capes, this Service might be perform'd by Men of War in&s;tead of Mer|chant Men, or Tran&s;ports. This effectual Manner of Tran&s;portation, as Felons are treated, and Things are managed now, would be more dreadful than hanging, whil&s;t it was only talk'd of; but when it came to the Pu&s;h, and Criminals came near, and under the Gallows, there would be very few, if they were &s;ober enough to think at all, that, before the Cart drove away, would not change their Minds, put off the evil Hour if they could, and chu&s;e Slavery, or any Thing el&s;e, to avoid immediate Death. But then, if the Regulations I have offer'd in the foregoing Chapter were likewi&s;e to be put in Practice, the forc'd Ab&s;tinence, and una|voidable Sobriety in Pri&s;on, with the other Preparations before Detah, and the Journey from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> without Hopes of Pardon or Reprieve, would &s;trike great Ter|ror
<PB N="52" REF="66">
even at a Di&s;tance; by which Means, the Thoughts of either would be in&s;upportable, and there would be no great Purcha&s;e in the Choice. The Horror loo&s;e People would conceive again&s;t &s;uch Proceedings, would be of ine&s;timable Con&s;equence to the Nation, and Thou&s;ands that are yet unborn would, deterr'd by the Rigour of tho&s;e Laws, turn their Hands to hone&s;t Labour, and die in their Beds in their own Country, that without them, and Things remaining as they are, will either be hanged, or tran&s;ported long before the End of this Century. But if what I propo&s;e &s;hould not le&s;&s;en the Number of Felons &s;o much as ought to be expected, it would clear us at lea&s;t from the Blame of not having endeavour'd it; and from Tran&s;|portation we &s;hould have the Satisfaction, that the Kingdom would not lo&s;e &s;o many Inhabitants by it as it does now, though the &s;ame Numbers were &s;ent abroad. But, what is infinitely more valuable, that Puni&s;hment likewi&s;e would rid without Slaughter, or Pro|bability of Return, the Country of the Ver|min of Society, that, perpetually nibbling at our Property, de&s;troy the Comforts of &s;ecure and undi&s;turb'd Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at the &s;ame Time that it would furni&s;h us with an Op|portunity of performing the mo&s;t charitable Action in the World; for &s;uch I will not &s;cruple to call the redeeming and re&s;toring to their Friends, without their Co&s;t, indu&s;tri|ous
<PB N="53" REF="67">
Mariners, that lo&s;t their Liberties, and became Sufferers in an hone&s;t Calling, and were led into dreadful Captivity by Infidels, whil&s;t, in promoting the Intere&s;t of Com|merce and Navigation, they were labouring for the Safety, the Wealth, and Glory of their Country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be told by &s;ome of my Readers, that they are ready to contribute to the Redemp|tion of unfortunate Captives with their Pur|&s;es; but that among Chri&s;tians, free-born Subjects ought never to be made Slaves for a|ny Rea&s;on, or at any Rate whatever. But this is a Singularity peculiar to <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> more built on an Exce&s;s of Good-nature, than any &s;ound Rea&s;on. <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> make u&s;e of Malefactors in their Gallies, and the <HI>Hugonots</HI> of the fir&s;t would never have complained of that Puni&s;hment, had it never been inflicted on any but Thieves and Vil|lains. But the&s;e are <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Coun|tries, and arbitrary Kingdoms: Of <HI>Holland</HI> you can &s;ay neither, and yet the great Ci|ties of it have all Work-hou&s;es for Criminals, At <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> there is one, where Felons are kept con&s;tantly employ'd in ra&s;ping of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Wood: To earn at this as much as they &s;pend is not to be done without exce&s;&s;ive Labour, though they fare as hard as they work; yet they are obliged to get more than their Maintenance co&s;ts con&s;iderably. They have a Task &s;et them, which if they do not per|form,
<PB N="54" REF="68">
the Neglect of their Hands is reveng'd on their Bellies; and they are &s;tinted in their Allowance in Proportion to the Deficiency. In this Place a very &s;trict Hand is kept over them; no Offences are left unpuni&s;hed, and they are often drubb'd even for ill Language. The Periods of Time, for which Felons are condemned to this Ra&s;p-hou&s;e, are va&s;tly dif|ferent, according as their great Crimes, or &s;lighter Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es de&s;erve this Tuition, and them&s;elves are young or old Offenders, and judged to be more or le&s;s incorrigible, from &s;ix Weeks to ninety nine Years. The&s;e are not called Slaves; but &s;uch is their Abode, their Diet, and their Di&s;cipline, that of tho&s;e who were to be confined there for any con|&s;iderable Number of Years, I don't believe there ever was one who would not have thought it a glorious Preferment, if, in&s;tead of it, he might have taken his Chance, and been &s;old for a Slave in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>We have, I own, no open Enemies in <HI>Africk</HI> more than any where el&s;e at pre&s;ent; and our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign has, by his Clemency and powerful Influence over the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> procured Liberty to tho&s;e of his Subjects that had been taken in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships: But it is wrong from thence to infer, that there are no Slaves in <HI>Turky</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e that are brought up to the Sea, there are many, that, by &s;everal Acci|dents,
<PB N="55" REF="69">
are left a&s;hore in Foreign Parts, and are nece&s;&s;itated to enter them&s;elves on any Ships they can meet with. If this be done in Time of Peace, and when they are not &s;ummoned to &s;erve their own Country, they are guilty of no Fault. But as all Mariners, as well as Soldiers, &s;hare the Fate of tho&s;e on who&s;e Side they engage, &s;o many of our Sailors are Slaves in <HI>Turky,</HI> that were taken in <HI>French, Dutch,</HI> and other Ships, and are con&s;equently not reclaimable by any Treaty made with <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Tho' the&s;e might not de&s;erve the &s;ame Regard altogether with tho&s;e that were taken in Ships of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Nation; yet, as they are our Country|men, and have committed no Crime, their Redemption ought not to be deferred one Moment, if they might be had in Exchange for others, whom we have judged not wor|thy to live among&s;t us. Be&s;ides, as we are at Peace now with all tho&s;e Rovers, &s;o half a Year hence, &s;ome or other of them may fall out with us; their Friend&s;hip is not much to be depended upon: Let the Pro|vi&s;ion but be made, and Felons kept at hard Labour, and under &s;trict Di&s;cipline at home, till they are wanted abroad, and we &s;hall find, that the In&s;titution it &s;elf, the very Name of it, will be of va&s;t U&s;e, before the Thing it&s;elf is put into Practice.</P>
