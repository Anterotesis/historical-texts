<HEAD><HI>HANNIBAL</HI> at the Gates: OR, THE PROGRESS OF Jacobiti&s;m, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_How near the Brink of Ruin we have &s;tood, and how often we have been re&s;cu'd from impending Dangers by the very Fin|ger of Providence, the de&s;|perate Struggles that have been made for Liberty, thro' the &s;everal Stages of the la&s;t Century, are &s;ufficient Indications: Yet no &s;ooner has the Tempe&s;t abated, and the Horrour of the Scene cool'd upon our Minds, but (as if we were fond of making
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Fatal Experiments) &s;ome re&s;tle&s;s and im|placable Spirits have troubled the Air afre&s;h, and thrown us into the &s;ame hazardous Circum&s;tances again. And what makes our Ca&s;e the more deplorable, is, that the &s;ame &s;tale Artifices, by which the people have been &s;o often deluded, are, without the lea&s;t Colouring or Varni&s;h, trump'd up Succe&s;&s;|fully at every turn, when either the Ambi|tion, or Nece&s;&s;ities of a few pernicious In&s;tru|ments are to be &s;erv'd. A due Reflection upon the Ea&s;ine&s;s and Credulity of this Nation, has made me often Pronounce us the mo&s;t unthinking Animals in Nature, and even below the &s;yllie&s;t Species of the whole Field, who are never caught twice in that Snare they have been once intangl'd in. It's really amazing, that in a Con&s;titution &s;o well guarded, and where People daily fea&s;t upon the Ble&s;&s;ings of Liberty, that the Bya&s;s &s;hould run &s;o &s;trong to <HI>Slavery,</HI> e&s;pe|cially when the open and avow'd Enemies of Freedom, and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t,</HI> lye within &s;o &s;mall a Gra&s;p; but then, if we throw the In&s;en&s;ibility of &s;ome, the Indo|lence of others, the Ob&s;tinacy of a third, and, in fine, the Ductile Temper of the Generality, (tho' in mo&s;t re&s;pects firm to the E&s;&s;entials of our Con&s;titution) into the Scale with tho&s;e few, but watchful Agents,

the wonder will &s;oon abate. It was the Glory of Former Ages to have been always Furni&s;h'd with a Set of bold and uncorrupted Patriots; who, upon the lea&s;t Approach of Danger, &s;poke their Sentiments freely, and took all the Legal Precautions to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t a Domineering Faction. Even after the Re&s;toration of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when &s;o &s;trong an Acclivity to <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> run thro' the whole Na|tion, and the People were &s;o perfectly tir'd out with the many Fanta&s;tick Schemes of a fal&s;e Liberty, that the true Notion of <HI>Legal Right</HI> was, in a manner, turn'd into Ridicule: Even at that time, there was not wanting a &s;et of Brave and Hone&s;t Men, of unblemi&s;h'd Loyalty, who Check'd the forward Humour of the Populace, and re|&s;train'd them from making an ab&s;olute Sur|render of their Liberties. The many En|chroachments that were made in that Reign, notwith&s;tanding all the Precautions taken by &s;ome Good Men in Power, plainly &s;hows, what an ea&s;y Prey we had fallen to Tyran|ny, if they had not timely oppos'd the Torrent; and tho' that Healing Parliament, which &s;at for &s;o many Years after the King's Return, gave into the Imperious Mea&s;ures of the Court &s;o long, that they had &s;carce any thing left to make a free Gift of, lea&s;t

they &s;hould be thought to give &s;o much as an Umbrage to Popular Complaints; yet the warm Expo&s;tulations they were forc'd to at la&s;t, explain to us their Mode&s;t Sen&s;e of the Grievances afoot: But De&s;potick Sway &s;till increa&s;ing, and Tyranny ripening by their Neglect, the Parliament of Eighty began to &s;earch deep into the Wounds the State had receiv'd, and finding &s;o many <HI>Siuus</HI>'s on every hand, where the Malignity had &s;pread, Re&s;olv'd to lay all open.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;ts which had hover'd &s;o long about the Eyes of the People clear'd up, and the Nation began to &s;ee their Danger in a true Light, and every Man &s;ilently re|proach'd him&s;elf for being &s;o prodigal of his Liberty. They then had the Mortifi|cation to &s;ee a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Plot in a Manner &s;ti|fled, and only a few of the needy and low|er Rank of Parricides brought, with Diffi|culty, to Ju&s;tice. Still the bu&s;y Part, the Abettors of <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Popery,</HI> acted in Di|verting the Stream of the Evidence, in&s;pi|red the People with double Eagerne&s;s and Vivacity to put it in the right Channel, and were in a fair Way of putting a Period to the Hopes of that accur&s;ed Faction.</P>
<P>The Pul&s;e of the Nation at that Juncture beat high for Liberty; and during the high Ferment which &s;o many wicked At|tempts
<PB N="7" REF="6">
upon Liberty and Religion had rais'd in the Brea&s;ts of the People, the Necking Blow was ju&s;t giving to <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> had the prudent Fore-&s;ight of the Commons, in Preferring <HI>The Bill of Exclu&s;ion,</HI> been &s;econded by the Approba|tion of the Upper Hou&s;e. The un&s;ea&s;ona|ble Indulgence at that Time granted to a Royal Branch, thro' an Exce&s;s of Loyalty, pav'd the Way to &s;ucceeding Mi&s;eries; and there were not wanting a Set of Un|dertakers, to give a wrong Turn to the Vi|gilance and bold Execution of that Tru&s;t repos'd in the Commons: And &s;uch was the In&s;tability of the People, that in a &s;hort Proce&s;s of Time, the Vein of Liber|ty had &s;pent it&s;elf, and the Tide run &s;o &s;trong upward, that there was no Po&s;&s;ibili|ty of Oppo&s;ing it. This brave Attempt of the Commons drew down an unexpiable Di&s;plea&s;ure upon &s;ome of the chief Lead|ers in the Enterprize, but it was their Glory to &s;uffer in the ju&s;te&s;t Cau&s;e, to be in the fir&s;t Rank of Martyrs for the Laws and Liberties of their Country, and their A&s;hes will be &s;till Sacred to all in the true Intere&s;t of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>In this State of Infatuation we continu'd, till the Prophetick Fears of the&s;e gallant Patriots were accompli&s;h'd in a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="8" REF="7">
At length, after a Thou&s;and Vio|lations of the Laws, and de&s;perate Pu&s;hes at the whole Body of the Con&s;titution, this poor deluded Nation were pleas'd to awake once more out of their long and lazy Dreams, and &s;eem'd, by a lively Re&s;ent|ment of their former Credulity, and ill U|&s;age, never to be impos'd on again. The Scars which the &s;hort liv'd Rage of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> had left behind, were deeply imprinted on the Minds of the Nation; and Men of the &s;hallowe&s;t Speculations could tell you then, that <HI>Popery,</HI> under all the Oaths, Re&s;traints, and Bridles, that could be laid upon it, was incon&s;i&s;tent either with Civil or Religious <HI>Liberty</HI>; nay even the ranke&s;t Clergy, who had made the Doctrine of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience</HI> a Scaffold to their Preferments, and coveted Dignities at the Price of their immortal Souls, a&s;ham'd of Practi&s;ing with the People any longer, were &s;o far from Enforcing this batter'd Topick, that they rather put them upon the Defen&s;ive Part. Then all Eyes crowded to their <HI>Deliverer,</HI> and mutually congratulated each other upon this &s;ea&s;ona|ble Re&s;cue. The Nation then plainly &s;aw to what Extremities their fooli&s;h Quarrels and Di&s;tinctions had reduc'd them. <HI>Whigg</HI> and <HI>Tory, High</HI> and <HI>Low,</HI> were unfa&s;hiona|ble
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Names, lo&s;t in the prevailing Harmony of <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant In|tere&s;t. Moderation</HI> was then look'd upon as a laudable Quality, and mo&s;t People had &s;een &s;o much of a Zeal contrary to Know|ledge, that they could not approve of Fu|ry in any Dre&s;s. The mo&s;t <HI>Orthodox Churchmen</HI> profe&s;s'd a true <HI>Primitive Una|nimity,</HI> and coming to &s;uch a Temper with all that di&s;&s;ented from them, as gave every &s;ober Man a delightful Pro&s;pect from the fir&s;t Opening of this happy Scene.</P>
<P>Family Revenges handed down to Po&s;te|rity, thro' an Inveteracy of Principle, and heighten'd by a warm Reflection upon the ill Offices done to each other in tho&s;e <HI>Bloody</HI> and <HI>Unnatural Wars,</HI> &s;eem'd bury'd in Oblivion. In &s;hort, one Soul actuated the whole Nation, and all prepar'd to be happy in good earne&s;t. Yet in tho&s;e Days (and I believe mo&s;t People then thought them the happie&s;t that ever befell <HI>Eng|land</HI>) we happen'd all to be in the mo|dern Phra&s;e, <HI>Antimonarchical, Republican, Heterodox Creatures,</HI> (or, in a more conci&s;e way of Talking) <HI>Whiggs, Dete&s;table Whiggs</HI>; nay, even the <HI>Moderate Papi&s;ts,</HI> and &s;ome of the fir&s;t Cla&s;s among&s;t the <HI>Non-Jurors.</HI> Sir <HI>E&mdash;d S&mdash;r</HI> was
<PB N="10" REF="9">
a <HI>Whigg,</HI> when he &s;ign'd the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> at <HI>Exeter,</HI> tho' I am at a Lo&s;s to know what he was upon the Attainder of <HI>F&mdash;k. H&mdash;w</HI> was certainly a <HI>Whigg,</HI> when he accepted of the <HI>Golden Key,</HI> tho' there was &s;oom Room to charge his Principle betwixt that and the <HI>Felonious Treaty.</HI> A certain P&mdash;r towards the <HI>North,</HI> was a <HI>Whigg,</HI> when he came to pay his Homage to King <HI>William,</HI> and it's Pity &s;uch a Convert was lo&s;t thro' a Failure in &s;ome <HI>Punctilio</HI>'s in his Reception. Archbi&s;hop <HI>S&mdash;ft</HI> was no le&s;s than a downright <HI>Whigg,</HI> when he demanded the Keys of the <HI>Tower</HI> from <HI>Sk&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>The Examples of this Kind are infinite, and therefore let no Man be &s;tartled, when I tell him that every <HI>Tory</HI> of Eminence has been a <HI>Whigg,</HI> at a convenient Time, tho' the Reproach is not convertible: How the Complection of the Kingdom came to change, and from this Unanimity again&s;t <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> the People &s;plit into different Intere&s;ts, and have all along &s;erv'd the Enemies of our Country and Religion, in the Quality of Auxiliaries, is no great labour to rehear&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho', upon the Exit of King <HI>James,</HI> the the whole Nation &s;eem'd to Centre in one Per&s;wa&s;ion, and with a General voice pro|claim'd

King <HI>William</HI> their Deliverer, be|cau&s;e the Majority run &s;o &s;trong on his &s;ide; yet &s;everal Mi&s;chievous Pa&s;&s;ions lay brooding, in De&s;igning men, till they &s;aw how far the Opportunity might be improv'd to their re&s;pective Intere&s;ts. The Sticklers for a Regency, dazzled with the Image of Royalty, kept fair with the Times, in hopes, that if their Schemes &s;ucceeded, they &s;hould be powerfully re|commended by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Guardian&s;hip of the Realm; But that Project once bla&s;ted, the Sen&s;e of the Deliverance &s;oon cool'd in their Thoughts, and a Di&s;gu&s;t at the E&s;tabli&s;hment took place of it.</P>
<P>Others over-bearing them&s;elves upon &s;ome &s;light Merit in the Proceeding Reign, and who challeng'd their former Po&s;ts as their Right, not finding their Expectations an&s;wer'd, &s;oon fell into Di&s;content, and endeavour'd to Blacken the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>Another Body, deeply involv'd in Guilt, and who&s;e Crimes, in a le&s;s Merciful hand then King <HI>William</HI>'s, could not have been pa&s;s'd over with Impunity, thought by double Application, to merit a Pardon; but once finding the danger pa&s;t, return'd to their former Violence, and meditated fre&s;h Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">A different Cla&s;s, who expected the Admini&s;tration to be lodg'd in &s;ome pecu|liar Hands, and all others excluded from Tru&s;t, finding the Kings Favours exten&s;ive to good Men of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, &s;oon for|got the amicable Temper they had boa&s;ted of whil&s;t the Storm was threatening their <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> and rang'd them&s;elves with the other Malecontents.</P>
<P>The&s;e fiery Tempers rendring them&s;el|ves obnoxious to the State, by the Violence of their Proceedings, made Religion the Stalking Hor&s;e to their <HI>Ambition</HI> and <HI>Revenge.</HI> From the&s;e Narrow and &s;elfi&s;h Principles they form'd a Separate Body, under the Character of <HI>Rigid Churchmen,</HI> who made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to oppo&s;e the <HI>Moderate,</HI> in all their Undertakings for the good of the Publick; and to &s;how their mortal Aver&s;ion to any Offers from the other &s;ide, went roundly into all Mea&s;ures de&s;tructive of <HI>Liberty</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t.</HI></P>

Had a few of the Wil|de&s;t been cut down in time, before they had gather'd &s;uch an Head, or been De|barr'd of the Vital Nouri&s;hment of State Places and Preferments, we had not at this time been plagu'd with their bane|ful Influences. But the Settlement was then in its Infancy, and Clemency being one of the King's chiefe&s;t Attributes, the Malignity, in&s;tead of being Cur'd by gentle Applications, grew Epidemical; when all the&s;e Humours were a-float, Good-Nature, Humanity, Religion, and a Sen&s;e of Liberty were born down by the &s;everal gu&s;ts of Pa&s;&s;ion and Revenge.
<PB N="14" REF="13">
The Days of their ancient Slavery were magnify'd; and the memorable Redemption in Eighty Eight was laid in the Du&s;t. But when no Blemi&s;h could be fix'd upon the Admini&s;tration, they brought out their <HI>Old Idol,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> Bleeding, and in a de&s;perate Condition; and giving out, that <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> was coming in like a Torrent, tho' the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Promotions were under the Direction of tho&s;e very Prelates, who had equally &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;bytery.</HI> It would puzzle a Man of the nice&s;t Penetration to account for the Actions of the&s;e Madmen: Nay, even when the Game was entirely in their own Hands, they &s;u&s;pected foul Play, and murmur'd at the <HI>Legal Indulgences,</HI> which others thought them&s;elves &s;ufficiently hap|py in. Of &s;o U&s;urping a Nature is this <HI>Tory-Mon&s;ter,</HI> that nothing but a Mo|nopoly of Wealth, Favour, and Intere&s;t, can glut his ravenous Appetite: The Pride and Oppre&s;&s;ion that is intermix'd with the Blood and Spirits of this de|&s;tructive Race, &s;tifles all Acts of Benevo|lence in them, and makes them, by Sym|pathy, love <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> for the &s;ake of Per&s;ecuting in their &s;ubordinate Stations. But to draw the Scene clo&s;er: Tho' all the&s;e Sparks of Rancour and Ma|lice

again&s;t the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment glow'd warm in the Brea&s;ts of the&s;e re&s;t|le&s;s Animals, yet they had the Decency to &s;mother them till the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Suc|ce&s;&s;ion in the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> was fix'd by Parliament: Then the Flame took Vent; all their Pa&s;&s;ions blaz'd; and every Tongue was &s;et on Fire.</P>
<P>Before that Time, a <HI>Jacobite</HI> was of no great Importance in the Eye of the People; he had a Mark &s;et upon him, and &s;hunn'd by all who had the Welfare of their Country at Heart: In all Publick Debates, the Leading Men who favour'd that Par|ty, and were qualify'd by Law to do Mi&s;chief, were very tender of Pointing out the Subject of their Grievances on this Side, or the Object of their &s;incere&s;t Wi&s;h|es on the other Side of the Water: It was a Point of too much Delicacy to be pro|fe&s;&s;edly handled, and therefore the be&s;t Service they could do their Colleagues, the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> was by indirect Means, re|mote Fetches, and Thwarting the Publick Spirited Attempts of all true <HI>Prote&s;tant Britons.</HI> Be&s;ides, the Succe&s;&s;ion, before that Act, being precarious after the Demi&s;e of our pre&s;ent Queen, (if they could have commanded their Tempers to wait &s;o long) kept them up in flu&s;h Hopes, that during
<PB N="16" REF="15">
the Con&s;ternation, they might have a fair Chance for Accompli&s;hing their Wi&s;hes: This notable Scheme of theirs was fully explain'd, when they were brought to the <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of Voting For or Again&s;t the Clau&s;e in Favour of the <HI>Hanover Succe&s;&s;ion</HI>; for maugre all their Attempts to &s;tifle this Home Charge again&s;t them, and the printed Vindication of the <HI>Tory</HI> Members from any Sugge&s;tion of that Kind, the be&s;t Part of the Apology is altogether Sophi&s;tical and Eva&s;ive; for tho', in Point of Logical Truth, they did not divide upon the &s;e|cond Amendment &s;ent down by the Lords, in Order to &s;trengthen the Intere&s;t of that Augu&s;t Family; and upon which the chief Stre&s;s of the Debate lay, yet the whole Management lay open to half an Eye.</P>
<P>The prime Leaders Propo&s;ing to give as little Offence as might be upon &s;o tender a Point, went artificially to Work, and try'd the Force of Numbers upon the fir&s;t A|mendment. That being carry'd again&s;t them, and being not of equal Importance with the &s;econd, which made it Trea&s;on for any one to oppo&s;e that Succe&s;&s;ion after the Demi&s;e of the Queen, they were afraid of Alaruming &s;ome of their own Party, who were unwarily drawn into the
<PB N="17" REF="16">
fir&s;t Di&s;agreement, and therefore had no great Stomach to divide upon the &s;econd Amendment, it not being u&s;ual for the weaker Side, upon Lo&s;ing a previous Que&s;tion, to divide upon a &s;ub&s;equent Clau&s;e intermix'd with the &s;ame Debate; &s;o that if may be without any Breach of Charity, or Straining of Inferences, from the whole Cour&s;e of the Debate; that they were again&s;t all the Amendments, tho' they only divided upon the fir&s;t: If they had been &s;incere for the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Line, why did they not readily come into all the Provi&s;ional Securities for the Safety of that Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e? Or rather, why did they in&s;i&s;t on the Danger of Multiplying Trea&s;ons, and Aggravating the Inconveniencies that might ari&s;e from new Trea&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It's plain from that Minute the <HI>Pretender</HI> was in open View. If the fir&s;t Act for Settling the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> prompted them to cur&s;e that Legacy of King <HI>William,</HI> this &s;trengthening Act tran&s;ported them be|yond Mea&s;ure; and &s;ince that Time they have not labour'd to conceal their Senti|ments. It was a very fa&s;hionable Expre&s;|&s;ion, I remember, at the Beginning of this Reign, <HI>viz. Retrieving the Honour of the</HI> English <HI>Nation.</HI> What Honour had been
<PB N="18" REF="17">
lo&s;t to the Nation, we know at who&s;e Doors to lay the Wa&s;te: Indeed <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> had been very much di&s;countenanced in King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, and every Man enjoy'd a compleat <HI>Eng|li&s;h Liberty</HI>; &s;o that, the Meaning of that Phraze could &s;ignify nothing, except Re|viving the exploded Topick of Divine Tyranny of former Days, and all the Slavi&s;h Po&s;itions under which the Nation agoniz'd for &s;ome Ages. But they made their Court wrong, and in the Reign of a Prince&s;s who, from her fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, declar'd how much &s;he had the Ea&s;e and Liberty of her People at Heart. It was hop'd, that under an Ad|mini&s;tration they &s;o much long'd for, the&s;e re&s;tle&s;s Spirits might have been compos'd, and fallen into a true <HI>Engli&s;h Intere&s;t,</HI> un|der the Influence of &s;uch an Example. But three Years were &s;carce elaps'd, when they revil'd the Per&s;on whom they former|ly call'd their Stay and Support, libelled a <HI>Prote&s;tant Mini&s;try,</HI> attack'd the Supre|macy, and ro&s;e to all the Outrage of Threats and ill Language. Could an Enemy explain their Meaning to more Di&s;advantage than they them&s;elves did upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions? Was it not a plain Indication of the Intere&s;t they were en|gag'd
<PB N="19" REF="18">
in? They quarrel'd with King <HI>William</HI> for his over-weaning Love to <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI>; they &s;poke di&s;re&s;pectfully of the pre&s;ent Queen, for no other Rea&s;on but being too affectionate to the True Church: Who then could be the Per&s;on in view, that they thought would Support them better? Or what Church was it they Complain'd was not Supported? The Church of <HI>England,</HI> during the&s;e Complaints, was &s;upply'd with Ortho|dox and Learned Prelates; the Queen had been Beneficent to a Prodigy. There was no Innovation &s;o much as attempted, but all Di&s;cipline enforc'd with as much Zeal as the Times would bear: Well, then it's plain they had always another Church than that of <HI>England</HI>; and another Intere&s;t in view, which they expected &s;hould &s;upport their Authority by Arbitrary Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>This is what that Virulent Faction has always aim'd at, and never can, by their Principles, be Cordial Subjects to any Prince, who will not go the &s;ame de&s;|perate Lengths they chalk out. And Let them Skin over their Re&s;entments never &s;o fair, they cannot, by their Complection, accord with the true Genius of <HI>England, For they are either Rebels in Di&s;grace: Or</HI>

<P>The <HI>U&s;urpation</HI> of King <HI>William</HI> was the lea&s;t Concern in the Que&s;tion: His Reign, and the pretended Calamities, which had attended the Revolution, were but only Incidents of the Tragedy that had been acted.

But their Hopes being de|feated by the precipitate Flight of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> it was no difficult Matter to gue&s;s how they would have acted upon a nearer Approach of Danger, by their &s;ub|&s;equent Behaviour: For when all the <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> was pa&s;t, which they had con|jur'd up, the Pulpits, without any manner of Call, or Provocation from the Nece&s;&s;ity of our Affairs, &s;ounded to Arms a-fre&s;h, in their ironical <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;ting Cant,</HI> which, among&s;t that Cla&s;s of Men, is the u&s;ual Watch-word for Rebellion.

<P>When no Hopes appear'd from that Quarter, their next Attempt was made at Home; and flattering them&s;elves with a Majority of the Nation on their Side, they e&s;&s;ay'd to do the Work among&s;t them&s;elves, without the Help of any Auxiliaries from Abroad.</P>
<P>Accordingly they pitch'd upon one of the mo&s;t <HI>Common</HI> PROSTITUTES of Vertue and Mode&s;ty, in the three King|doms, (who&s;e Memory will always be Sacred with the Admirers of <HI>Cain, He|ro&s;tratus,</HI> and <HI>Guido Faux</HI>) to rai&s;e Se|dition upon the old <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> Topick.

Then the true Intent and Purport of this My&s;terious Doctrine was obvious to every <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> when all the Arrows out of that Poy&s;o|nous Quiver were levelled at the Queen,
<PB N="27" REF="26">
who had &s;o great an Hand in that ble&s;&s;ed Change: Yet the Faction, with their u&s;ual Impudence, would have fa&s;ten'd Contra|dictions upon the World, and made us be|lieve, that the Re&s;i&s;tance the Queen abet|ted at that Time by her Gracious and u&s;eful Pre&s;ence, was fatal to her Title in its Con&s;equences, when that Ca&s;e was urg'd with an Exception to the general Rule of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience,</HI> and never to be &s;o much as attempted, but in the la&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;itous Circum&s;tances, even no le&s;s than the entire Subver&s;ion of the Con&s;titution. But it's plain, the unlimited Obedience there pre&s;s'd, could never be de&s;ign'd to the pre&s;ent Queen, her Title ari&s;ing out of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> which was founded in Re&s;i&s;tance, neither could it be any Com|plement to lodge &s;uch a Power with her, as &s;he was never fond of, &s;he Governing her&s;elf and Subjects, by the Laws of the Con&s;titution. But the <HI>Pretender</HI> being in view, the Model of his Government was laid down, and recommended in that <HI>Arbi|trary</HI> way, he might be &s;uppos'd to act; and by the Tenour of the Libel, even her Maje&s;ty was as much caution'd again&s;t Re|&s;i&s;ting the Lawful and Rightful Heir, as any of her Subjects.</P>
<P>Still, whatever malignant Planet rul'd,
<PB N="28" REF="27">
this impudent Prevarication met with Vo|taries, and what, in &s;ober Times, would have cover'd &s;uch a Parricide with eternal Shame and Ignominy, gave him a larger Degree of Sufficiency than before, and turn'd to his Glory among&s;t the poor de|luded Rabble.</P>
<P>This Vein of <HI>Slavery</HI> and <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> in|crea&s;ing, after the <HI>merciful Award,</HI> the Faction &s;till kept feeding the popular Hu|mours, till at la&s;t they were neither afraid nor a&s;ham'd to tell the World, that they could not be &s;atisfy'd with any Title below the degree of <HI>Indefea&s;ible</HI> and <HI>Divine Right.</HI> The&s;e Terms which were almo&s;t grown ob&s;olete, were renew'd, and cramm'd into many publick Addre&s;&s;es. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the dubious Expre&s;&s;ions, and plain Hints, which to every narrow Capacity &s;eem ob|vious enough: In &s;ome Papers we find &s;uch an uncontroulable Power devolv'd upon the Crown, which (tho' our Gracious Queen never &s;how'd the lea&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition towards A&s;&s;uming) &s;ufficiently explains into what Hands the Faction is willing it &s;hould fall. But among&s;t all the late Demon&s;trations of ardent Affection to the Queen, and pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, it's a little &s;hocking, that &s;ome have been &s;o hardy to approach her Maje&s;ty without &s;o much as the lea&s;t No|tice

<P>As her Maje&s;ty is the Parent of her Country, and indeed the Nur&s;ing Mother of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e,</HI> &s;o it mu&s;t be a Plea&s;ure to one of her tender Sentiments, to think and hear that the Political Child, as well as the Religious Intere&s;t of her Country, is likely to be &s;o well provided

No &s;ure, rather plea&s;e the Ear, and gratify the Spirits; and tho' the Di&s;like to that Great Family appears but too open, yet, methinks, in pure Deference to her Ma|je&s;ty's E&s;teem of it, at lea&s;t a cool Mention might be made of the Name; but their Aver&s;ion being unconquerable, and the Bent of their Souls lying &s;o &s;trong to another Intere&s;t, they cannot put on &s;o much as a &s;pecious Di&s;gui&s;e upon their Rancour, but openly wearing the Livery of <HI>Le&s;ly</HI>'s <HI>Good Old Cau&s;e,</HI> pray that the Scepter may late drop into the Hands of the Rightful and Lawful Succe&s;&s;or, which &s;eems to be of no difficult Interpretation; with many other curious Phrazes too long to enumerate.

Temper, (meaning King <HI>James</HI>'s Con&s;ort) is very much moderated by her pa&s;t Sufferings, and the whole Court is re|&s;olv'd to conduct Affairs by more temperate Maxims: In fine, that the King (in the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Account, a Notorious Ba&s;tard) has &s;o true a Scheme of the Di&s;po&s;ition of his Loving Subjects, as never to bear upon the Laws or the Mildne&s;s of a Con&s;titution they have been accu&s;tom'd to, and that having his Grand-Father's and Father's Sufferings always in his Eye, he is re&s;olv'd only to a&s;&s;ert his own Hereditary Right, and never to di&s;pute any mans Legal one.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Baits by which the <HI>Popi&s;h Faction</HI> en&s;nare the Youth who never &s;aw the approaching Dangers before the <HI>Revo|lution,</HI> and think them much magnify'd by the Spleen of a malignant Party, with which, all in that cur&s;ed Intere&s;t a&s;per&s;e the true <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of the Kingdom, and even tho&s;e who were Eye-Witne&s;&s;es to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of former Days, have, thro' an Ea&s;e and Plenty of above 20 Years &s;tanding, grown &s;o forgetful and cold in their Re&s;ent|ments of tho&s;e <HI>Outrages</HI> which were daily of|fer'd to <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> by the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> in <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Red,</HI> that they expre&s;s very little Di&s;like of &s;eeing that di&s;mal Scene acted over again.</P>
<P>So &s;trongly has the Poi&s;on work'd thro'
<PB N="38" REF="37" MS="y">
the whole Nation, as to be, humanly &s;peaking, Proof again&s;t the mo&s;t Sovereign <HI>Antidotes</HI>; and tho' it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to trace the Source of this great Evil thro' the &s;everal intricate Valves and &s;mall Va&s;&s;els it runs, yet we cannot be &s;o blind as not to di&s;cover it receives a Sup|ply from Men of a better Figure, and way of Thinking, than are to be met with among&s;t the middle Cla&s;s of Mankind.</P>
<P>It's happy for this Nation at pre&s;ent, that we have &s;uch a Pure, Orthodox, and True <HI>Church of England</HI> Admini&s;tration to ballance the gene|ral Inclination to <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI>; and &s;tem the Majority of &s;o many wicked Tempers: It mu&s;t be an Argument of great Circum&s;pection in Men of &s;uch high Characters, if they e&s;cape falling under the La&s;h of &s;uch virulent Tongues and Pens, and are not maliciou&s;ly brought in as Abetting the De&s;igns of this <HI>Popi&s;h Faction</HI>; af|ter they have gone &s;uch a length in their cour&s;e of Impudence, &s;ome Time &s;ince, as to give out, That the Queen &s;ecretly favour'd their wicked Enterprizes, grounding their impious A&s;&s;er|tions, without Di&s;pute, upon her Royal Cle|mency, and their own Impunity. It is no great Complement at this Time to the Men in Power, neither do I believe they would be at all pleas'd, that &s;o many of the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves &s;o much upon the late Changes, or that they are every Day en|larging their Pro&s;pect from the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs. One would be tempted to think, by their Confidence, that they had receiv'd &s;ome A&s;&s;urances from the <HI>Great,</HI> but the Cha|racters of &s;uch a vigilant and faithful Mini&s;try &s;ecures all good People from any Apprehen&s;i|ons which might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e from the Ef|frontery

But let our Hopes from the Men in Power be never &s;o well grounded, and the Expectations of the <HI>Jacobite Faction</HI> never &s;o vain, yet it becomes eve|ry <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> at this Hour, to con&s;ider upon what a tickli&s;h Bottom he is like to &s;tand upon, from the Activity and In&s;olence of that Party; and it ought likewi&s;e to put him upon his Guard a|gain&s;t being unwarily drawn into their wicked A&s;&s;ociations under &s;pecious Pretences, to the Ruin of his Liberty, Religion, and Con&s;cience. That idle Pretence of the <HI>Church's</HI> Danger has been lately made the Handle to <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI>; I wi&s;h, be|fore that <HI>Notion</HI> has throughly &s;pent it &s;elf, it does not accompli&s;h the De&s;truction of the State: For the cunning Managers of the <HI>Jacobite Intere&s;t</HI> will keep up that plau&s;ible Topick till the Danger is ju&s;t at hand, and after having made an irreconci|lable Divi&s;ion among&s;t <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of all Per&s;wa|&s;ions, will urge Per&s;everance to tho&s;e who have been led away by them from the true <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and <HI>National Intere&s;t</HI>; and from the Extremities they have reduc'd them to, will propo&s;e a total <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> as the only Expedient left for <HI>Safety,</HI> and Probation of their Merit upon a Change.</P>
<P>It's plain, to a Demon&s;tration, that the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> ever &s;ince the 12th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> have been playing the <HI>Rigid Church men</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;t|ants</HI>
