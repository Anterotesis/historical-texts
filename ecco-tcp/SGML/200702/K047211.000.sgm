<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR la&s;t conver&s;ation, though not in the tone of ab&s;olute de&s;pondency, was far from chear|ful. We could not ea&s;ily account for &s;ome un|plea&s;ant appearances. They were repre&s;ented to us as indicating the &s;tate of the popular mind; and they were not at all what we &s;hould have expected from our old ideas even of the faults and vices of the Engli&s;h character. The di&s;a&s;trous events, which have followed one upon another in a long unbroken funereal train, moving in a proce&s;&s;ion, that &s;eemed to have no end, the&s;e were not the principal cau&s;es of our dejection. We feared more from what threatened to fail within, than what me|naced to oppre&s;s us from abroad. To a people who have once been proud and great, and great becau&s;e they were proud, a change in the national &s;pirit is the mo&s;t terrible of all revolutions.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall not live to behold the unravelling of the intricate plot, which &s;addens and perplexes the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
awful drama of Providence, now acting on the moral theatre of the world. Whether for thought or for action, I am at the end of my career. You are in the middle of yours. In what part of it's orbit the nation, with which we are carried along, moves at this in&s;tant, it is not ea&s;y to conjecture. It may, perhaps, be far advanced in its aphelion.&mdash; But when to return?</P>
<P>Not to lo&s;e our&s;elves in the infinite void of the conjectural world, our bu&s;ine&s;s is with what is likely to be affected for the better or the wor&s;e, by the wi&s;dom or weakne&s;s of our plans. In all &s;peculations upon men and human affairs, it is of no &s;mall moment to di&s;tingui&s;h things of accident from permanent cau&s;es, and from effects that cannot be altered. It is not every irregularity in our movement that is a total devi|ation from our cour&s;e. I am not quite of the mind of tho&s;e &s;peculators, who &s;eem a&s;&s;ured, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> nece&s;&s;arily, and by the con&s;titution of things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> States have the &s;ame periods of infancy, manhoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and decrepitude, that are found in the individuals who compo&s;e them. Parallels of this &s;ort rather furni&s;h &s;imilitudes to illu&s;trate or to adorn, than to &s;upply analogies from whence to rea|&s;on. The objects which are attempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o be forced into an analogy are not found in the &s;ame cla&s;&s;es of exi&s;tence. Individuals are phy&s;ical be|ings,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;ubject to laws univer&s;al and invariable. The immediate cau&s;e acting in the&s;e laws may be ob|&s;cure: The general re&s;ults are &s;ubjects of certain calculation. But commonwealths are not phy&s;ical but moral e&s;&s;ences. They are artificial combina|tions; and in their proximate efficient cau&s;e, the arbitrary productions of the human mind. We are not yet acquainted with the laws which nece&s;|&s;arily influence the &s;tability of that kind of work made by that kind of agent. There is not in the phy&s;ical order (with which they do not appear to hold any a&s;&s;ignable connexion) a di&s;tinct cau&s;e by which any of tho&s;e fabricks mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily grow, flouri&s;h, or decay; nor, in my opinion, does the moral world produce any thing more determinate on that &s;ubject, than what may &s;erve as an amu&s;e|ment (liberal indeed, and ingenious, but &s;till only an amu&s;ement) for &s;peculative men. I doubt whe|ther the hi&s;tory of mankind is yet compleat enough, if ever it can be &s;o, to furni&s;h grounds for a &s;ure theory on the internal cau&s;es which nece&s;&s;arily af|fect the fortune of a State. I am far from deny|ing the operation of &s;uch cau&s;es: But they are in|finitely uncertain, and much more ob&s;cure, and much more difficult to trace, than the foreign cau&s;es that tend to rai&s;e, to depre&s;s, and &s;ome|times to overwhelm a community.</P>
<P>It is often impo&s;&s;ible, in the&s;e political enquiries, to find any proportion between the apparent force
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of any moral cau&s;es we may a&s;&s;ign and their known operation. We are therefore obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance, or more piou&s;ly (perhaps more rationally) to the occa&s;ional inter|po&s;ition and irre&s;i&s;tible hand of the Great Di&s;|po&s;er. We have &s;een States of con&s;iderable duration, which for ages have remained nearly as they have begun, and could hardly be &s;aid to ebb or flow. Some appear to have &s;pent their vigour at their commencement. Some have blazed out in their glory a little before their extinction. The meri|dian of &s;ome has been the mo&s;t &s;plendid. Others, and they the greate&s;t number, have fluctuated, and experienced at different periods of their exi&s;tence a great variety of fortune. At the very moment when &s;ome of them &s;eemed plunged in unfathom|able aby&s;&s;es of di&s;grace and di&s;a&s;ter, they have &s;uddenly emerged. They have begun a new cour&s;e and opened a new reckoning; and even in the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of their country, have laid the foundations of a tow|ering and durable greatne&s;s. All this has happened without any apparent previous change in the ge|neral circum&s;tances which had brought on their di&s;tre&s;s. The death of a man at a critical junc|ture, his di&s;gu&s;t, his retreat, his di&s;grace, have brought innumerable calamities on a whole na|tion. A common &s;oldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almo&s;t of Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">Such, and often influenced by &s;uch cau&s;es, has commonly been the fate of Monarchies of long duration. They have their ebbs and their flows. This has been eminently the fate of the Monarchy of France. There have been times in which no Power has ever been brought &s;o low. Few have ever flouri&s;hed in greater glory. By turns elevated and depre&s;&s;ed, that Power had been, on the whole, rather on the encrea&s;e; and it continued not only powerful but formidable to the hour of the total ruin of the Monarchy. This fall of the Monarchy was far from being preceded by any exterior &s;ymptoms of decline. The interior were not vi&s;ible to every eye; and a thou&s;and ac|cidents might have prevented the operation of what the mo&s;t clear-&s;ighted were not able to di&s;cern, nor the mo&s;t provident to divine. A very little time before its dreadful cata&s;trophe, there was a kind of exterior &s;plendour in the &s;ituation of the Crown, which u&s;ually adds to Government &s;trength and authority at home. The Crown &s;eemed then to have obtained &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;plendid objects of &s;tate ambition. None of the Continental Powers of Europe were the ene|mies of France. They were all, either tacitly di&s;po&s;ed to her, or publickly connected with her; and in tho&s;e who kept the mo&s;t aloof, there was little appearance of jealou&s;y; of animo&s;ity there was no appearance at all. The Briti&s;h Nation, her great preponderating rival, &s;he had humbled; to
<PB N="6" REF="7">
all appearance &s;he had weakened; certainly had endangered, by cutting off a very large, and by far the mo&s;t growing part of her empire. In that it's acm&eacute; of human pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s, in the high and palmy &s;tate of the Monarchy of France, it fell to the ground without a &s;truggle. It fell without any of tho&s;e vices in the Monarch, which have &s;ometimes been the cau&s;es of the fall of kingdoms, but which exi&s;ted, without any vi&s;ible effect on the &s;tate, in the highe&s;t degree in many other Princes; and, far from de&s;troying their power, had only left &s;ome &s;light &s;tains on their character. The finan|cial difficulties were only pretexts and in&s;truments of tho&s;e who accompli&s;hed the ruin of that Mo|narchy. They were not the cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>Deprived of the old Government, deprived in a manner of all Government, France fallen as a Mo|narchy, to common &s;peculators might have ap|peared more likely to be an object of pity or in|&s;ult, according to the di&s;po&s;ition of the circumja|cent powers, than to be the &s;courge and terror of them all: But out of the tomb of the murdered Monarchy in France, has ari&s;en a va&s;t, tremendous, unformed &s;pectre, in a far more terrific gui&s;e than any which ever yet have overpowered the imagina|tion, and &s;ubdued the fortitude of man. Going &s;traight forward to it's end, unappalled by peril, un|checked by remor&s;e, de&s;pi&s;ing all common max|ims and all common means, that hideous phan|tom
<PB N="7" REF="8">
overpowerd tho&s;e who could not believe it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he could at all exi&s;t, except on the prin|ciples, which habit rather than nature had per&s;uad|ed them were nece&s;&s;ary to their own particular welfare and to their own ordinary modes of action. But the con&s;titution of any political being, as well as that of any phy&s;ical being, ought to be known, before one can venture to &s;ay what is fit for it's con&s;ervation, or what is the proper means of it's power. The poi&s;on of other States is the food of the new Republick. That bankruptcy, the very apprehen&s;ion of which is one of the cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned for the fall of the Monarchy, was the ca|pital on which &s;he opened her traffick with the world.</P>
<P>The Republick of Regicide with an annihilated revenue, with defaced manufactures, with a ruined commerce, with an uncultivated and half depopu|lated country, with a di&s;contented, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, en&s;lav|ed, and fami&s;hed people, pa&s;&s;ing with a rapid, eccen|trick, incalculable cour&s;e, from the wilde&s;t anarchy to the &s;terne&s;t de&s;poti&s;m, has actually conquered the fine&s;t parts of Europe, has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, di&s;united, deranged, and broke to pieces all the re&s;t; and &s;o &s;ubdued the minds of the rulers in every nation, that hardly any re&s;ource pre&s;ents it&s;elf to them, except that of entitling them&s;elves to a contemp|tuous mercy by a di&s;play of their imbecility and meanne&s;s. Even in their greate&s;t military efforts
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and the greate&s;t di&s;play of their fortitude, they &s;eem not to hope, they do not even appear to wi&s;h, the extinction of what &s;ub&s;i&s;ts to their certain ruin. Their ambition is only to be admitted to a more favoured cla&s;s in the order of &s;ervitude under that domineering power.</P>
<P>This &s;eems the temper of the day. At fir&s;t the French force was too much de&s;pi&s;ed. Now it is too much dreaded. As incon&s;iderate courage has given way to irrational fear, &s;o it may be hoped, that through the medium of deliberate &s;ober apprehen&s;ion, we may arrive at &s;teady fortitude. Who knows whether indignation may not &s;ucceed to terror, and the revival of high &s;entiment, &s;purn|ing away the delu&s;ion of a &s;afety purcha&s;ed at the expence of glory, may not yet drive us to that ge|nerous de&s;pair, which has often &s;ubdued di&s;tem|pers in the State for which no remedy could be found in the wi&s;e&s;t councils.</P>
<P>Other great States, having been without any re|gular certain cour&s;e of elevation, or decline, we may hope that the Briti&s;h fortune may fluctuate al|&s;o; becau&s;e the public mind, which greatly influences that fortune, may have it's changes. We are there|fore never authorized to abandon our country to it's fate, or to act or advi&s;e as if it had no re&s;ource. There is no rea&s;on to apprehend, becau&s;e ordinary
<PB N="9" REF="10">
means threaten to fail, that no others can &s;pring up. Whil&s;t our heart is whole, it will find means, or make them. The heart of the citizen is a pe|rennial &s;pring of energy to the State. Becau&s;e the pul&s;e &s;eems to intermit, we mu&s;t not pre&s;ume that it will cea&s;e in&s;tantly to beat. The publick mu&s;t never be regarded as incurable. I remember in the be|ginning of what has lately been called the &s;even years war, that an eloquent writer and ingenious &s;peculator, Dr. Browne, upon &s;ome rever&s;es which happened in the beginning of that war, publi&s;hed an elaborate philo&s;ophical di&s;cour&s;e to prove that the di&s;tingui&s;hing features of the people of Eng|land had been totally changed, and that a frivolous effeminacy was become the national character. Nothing could be more popular than that work. It was thought a great con&s;olation to us the light people of this country (who were and are light, but who were not and are not effeminate) that we had found the cau&s;es of our mi&s;fortunes in our vices. Pythagoras could not be more plea&s;ed with his leading di&s;covery. But whil&s;t in that &s;plenetick mood we amu&s;ed our&s;elves in a four critical &s;peculation, of which we were our&s;elves the objects, and in which every man lo&s;t his par|ticular &s;en&s;e of the publick di&s;grace in the epide|mic nature of the di&s;temper; whil&s;t, as in the Alps <HI>Goitre</HI> kept <HI>Goitre</HI> in countenance; whil&s;t we were thus abandoning our&s;elves to a direct con|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="11">
of our inferiority to France, and whil&s;t many, very many, were ready to act upon a &s;en&s;e of that inferiority, a few months effected a total change in our variable minds. We emerged from the gulph of that &s;peculative de&s;pondency; and were buoyed up to the highe&s;t point of prac|tical vigour. Never did the ma&s;culine &s;pirit of Eng|land di&s;play it&s;elf with more energy, nor ever did it's genius &s;oar with a prouder pre-eminence over France, than at the time when frivolity and effe|minacy had been at lea&s;t tacitly acknowledged as their national character, by the good people of this kingdom.</P>
<P>For one (if they be properly treated) I de&s;pair nei|ther of the publick fortune nor of the publick mind. There is much to be done undoubtedly, and much to be retrieved. We mu&s;t walk in new ways, or we can never encounter our enemy in his devious march. We are not at an end of our &s;truggle, nor near it. Let us not deceive our&s;elves: we are at the beginning of great troubles. I readily acknowledge that the &s;tate of publick affairs is infinitely more unpromi&s;|ing than at the period I have ju&s;t now alluded to, and the po&s;ition of all the Powers of Europe, in relation to us, and in relation to each other, is more intricate and critical beyond all compari&s;on. Difficult indeed is our &s;ituation. In all &s;itua|tions of difficulty men will be influenced in the
<PB N="11" REF="12">
part they take, not only by the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e, but by the peculiar turn of their own character. The &s;ame ways to &s;afety do not pre&s;ent them&s;elves to all men, nor to the &s;ame men in different tem|pers. There is a courageous wi&s;dom: there is al&s;o a fal&s;e reptile prudence, the re&s;ult not of caution but of fear. Under misfortunes it often happens that the nerves of the under&s;tanding are &s;o relaxed, the pre&s;&s;ing peril of the hour &s;o completely con|founds all the faculties, that no future danger can be properly provided for, can be ju&s;tly e&s;timated, can be &s;o much as fully &s;een. The eye of the mind is dazzled and vanqui&s;hed. An abject di&s;|tru&s;t of our&s;elves, an extravagant admiration of the enemy, pre&s;ent us with no hope but in a com|promi&s;e with his pride, by a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will. This &s;hort plan of policy is the only coun&s;el which will obtain a hearing. We plunge into a dark gulph with all the ra&s;h precipitation of fear. The nature of courage is, without a que&s;tion, to be con|ver&s;ant with danger; but in the palpable night of their terrors, men under con&s;ternation &s;uppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> not that it is the danger, which, by a &s;ure in&s;tinct, calls out the courage to re&s;i&s;t it, but that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he courage which produces the danger. They therefore &s;eek for a refuge from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eir fears in the fears them|&s;elves, and con&s;ider a temporizing meanne&s;s as the only &s;ource of &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">The rules and definitions of prudence can rarely be exact; never univer&s;al. I do not deny that in &s;mall truckling &s;tates a timely compromi&s;e with power has often been the means, and the only means, of drawling out their puny exi&s;tence: But a great &s;tate is too much envied, too much dreaded, to find &s;afety in humiliation. To be &s;ecure, it mu&s;t be re&s;pected. Power, and eminence, and con&s;ideration, are things not to be begged. They mu&s;t be commanded: and they who &s;upplicate for mercy from others can never hope for ju&s;tice thro' them&s;elves. What ju&s;tice they are to obtain, as the alms of an enemy, depends upon his character; and that they ought well to know before they im|plicitly confide.</P>
<P>Much controver&s;y there has been in Parliament, and not a little among&s;t us out of doors, about the in&s;trumental means of this nation towards the maintenance of her dignity, and the a&s;&s;ertion of her rights. On the mo&s;t elaborate and correct detail of facts, the re&s;ult &s;eems to be, that at no time has the wealth and power of Great Britain been &s;o con|&s;iderable as it is at this very perilous moment. We have a va&s;t intere&s;t to pre&s;erve, and we po&s;&s;e&s;s great means of pre&s;erving it: But it is to be remembered that the artificer may be incumbered by his tools, and that re&s;ources may be among impediments. If wealth is the obedient and laborious &s;lave of
<PB N="13" REF="14">
virtue and of publick honour, then wealth is in it's place, and has it's u&s;e: But if this order is chang|ed, and honor is to be &s;acrificed to the con&s;er|vation of riches, riches which have neither eyes nor hands, nor any thing truly vital in them, cannot long &s;urvive the being of their vivifying powers, their legitimate ma&s;ters, and their potent protectors. If we command our wealth, we &s;hall be rich and free: If our wealth commands us, we are poor indeed. We are bought by the enemy with the trea&s;ure from our own coffers. Too great a &s;en&s;e of the value of a &s;ubordinate intere&s;t may be the very &s;ource of it's danger, as well as the certain ruin of intere&s;ts of a &s;uperiour order. Often has a man lo&s;t his all becau&s;e he would not &s;ubmit to ha|zard all in defending it. A di&s;play of our wealth before robbers is not the way to re&s;train their bold|ne&s;s, or to le&s;&s;en their rapacity. This di&s;play is made, I know, to per&s;uade the people of England that thereby we &s;hall awe the enemy, and improve the terms of our capitulation: it is made, not that we &s;hould fight with more animation, but that we &s;hould &s;upplicate with better hopes. We are mi&s;taken. We have an enemy to deal with who ne|ver regarded our conte&s;t as a mea&s;uring and weigh|ing of pur&s;es. He is the Gaul that puts his <HI>&s;word</HI> into the &s;cale. He is more tempted with our wealth as booty, than terrifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d with it as power. But let us be rich or poor, let us be either in what
<PB N="14" REF="15">
proportion we may, nature is fal&s;e or this is true, that where the e&s;&s;ential publick force, (of which money is but a part,) is in any degree upon a par in a conflict between nations, that &s;tate which is re|&s;olved to hazard it's exi&s;tence rather than to aban|don it's objects, mu&s;t have an infinite advantage over that which is re&s;olved to yield rather than to carry it's re&s;i&s;tance beyond a certain point. Hu|manly &s;peaking, that people which bounds it's ef|forts only with it's being, mu&s;t give the law to that nation which will not pu&s;h it's oppo&s;ition beyond its convenience.</P>
<P>If we look to nothing but our dome&s;tick condi|tion, the &s;tate of the nation is full even to plethory; but if we imagine that this country can long main|tain it's blood and it's food, as disjoined from the community of mankind, &s;uch an opinion does not de&s;erve refutation as ab&s;urd, but pity as in&s;ane.</P>
<P>I do not know that &s;uch an improvident and &s;tupid &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, de&s;erves the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which, perhaps, I may be&s;tow upon it hereafter. We can|not arrange with our enemy in the pre&s;ent conjunc|ture, without abandoning the intere&s;t of mankind. If we look only to our own petty peculium in the war, we have had &s;ome advantanges; advantages ambiguous in their nature, and dearly bought. We have not in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, impaired the
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;trength of the common enemy, in any one of tho&s;e points in which his particular force con&s;i&s;ts; at the &s;ame time that new enemies to our&s;elves, new allies to the Regicide Republick, have been made out of the wrecks and fragments of the ge|neral confederacy. So far as to the &s;elfi&s;h part. As compo&s;ing a part of the community of Europe, and intere&s;ted in it's fate, it is not ea&s;y to conceive a &s;tate of things more doubtful and perplexing. When Louis the XIVth had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t important provinces of Spain; when he had in a manner over-run Lombardy, and was thundering at the gates of Turin; when he had ma&s;tered almo&s;t all Germa|ny on this &s;ide the Rhine; when he was on the point of ruining the augu&s;t fabrick of the Empire; when with the Elector of Bavaria in his alliance, hardly any thing interpo&s;ed between him and Vi|enna; when the Turk hung with a mighty force over the Empire on the other &s;ide; I do not know, that in the beginning of 1704 (that is in the third year of the renovated war with Louis the XIV) the &s;tate of Europe was &s;o truly alarming. To England it certainly was not. Holland (and Holland is a matter to England of value ine&s;tima|bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">) was then powerful, was then independant, and though greatly endangered, was then full of energy and &s;pirit. But the great re&s;ource of Europe was in England: Not in a &s;ort of England detached
<PB N="16" REF="17">
from the re&s;t of the world, and amu&s;ing her&s;elf with the puppet &s;how of a naval power, (it can be no better, whil&s;t all the &s;ources of that power, and of every &s;ort of power, are precarious) but in that &s;ort of England, who con&s;idered her&s;elf as embo|died with Europe; but in that &s;ort of England, who &s;ympathetick with the adver&s;ity or the happi|ne&s;s of mankind, felt that nothing in human af|fairs was foreign to her. We may con&s;ider it as a &s;ure axiom that, as on the one hand no con|federacy of the lea&s;t effect or duration can exi&s;t again&s;t France, of which England is not only a part, but the head, &s;o neither can England pre|tend to cope with France but as connected with the body of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Our account of the war, <HI>as a war of communion,</HI> to the very point in which we began to throw out lures, oglings, and glances for peace, was a war of di&s;a&s;ter and of little el&s;e. The independant advantages obtained by us at the beginning of the war, and which were made at the expence of that common cau&s;e, if they deceive us about our large&s;t and our &s;ure&s;t intere&s;t, are to be reckoned among&s;t our heavie&s;t lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The allies, and Great Britain among&s;t the re&s;t, (and perhaps among&s;t the foremo&s;t) have been mi|&s;erably deluded by this great fundamental error;
<PB N="17" REF="18">
that it was in our power to make peace with this mon&s;ter of a State, whenever we cho&s;e to forget the crimes that made it great, and the de&s;igns that made it formidable. People imagined that their cea&s;ing to re&s;i&s;t was the &s;ure way to be &s;e|cure. This <Q REND="inline">"pale ca&s;t of thought ficklied over all their enterprizes and turned all their politicks awry."</Q>They could not, or rather they would not read, in the mo&s;t unequivocal declarations of the ene|my, and in his uniform conduct, that more &s;afe|ty was to be found in the mo&s;t arduous war, than in the friend&s;hip of that kind of being. It's ho&s;tile amity can be obtained on no terms that do not im|ply an inability hereafter to re&s;i&s;t it's de&s;igns. This great prolific error (I mean that peace was always in our power) has been the cau&s;e that rendered the allies indifferent about the <HI>direction</HI> of the war; and per&s;uaded them that they might always ri&s;que a choice, and even a change in it's objects. They &s;eldom improved any advantage; hoping that the enemy, affected by it, would make a proffer of peace. Hence it was, that all their early victo|ries have been followed almo&s;t immediately with the u&s;ual effects of a defeat; whil&s;t all the advantages obtained by the Regicides, have been followed by the con&s;equences that were na|tural. The di&s;comfitures, which the Republick of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins has &s;uffered, have uniformly called forth new exertions, which not only repaired old
<PB N="18" REF="19">
lo&s;&s;es, but prepared new conque&s;ts. The lo&s;&s;es of the allies, on the contrary, (no provi&s;ion having been made on the Speculation of &s;uch an event) have been followed by de&s;ertion, by di&s;may, by di&s;|union, by a dereliction of their policy, by a flight from their principles, by an admiration of the ene|my, by mutual accu&s;ations, by a di&s;tru&s;t in every member of the alliance of it's fellow, of it's cau&s;e, it's power, and it's courage.</P>
<P>Great difficulties in con&s;equence of our errone|ous policy, as I have &s;aid, pre&s;s upon every &s;ide of us. Far from de&s;iring to conceal or even to palli|ate the evil in the repre&s;entation, I wi&s;h to lay it down as my foundation, that never greater exi&s;ted. In a moment when &s;udden panick is apprehended, it may be wi&s;e, for a while to conceal &s;ome great publick di&s;a&s;ter, or to reveal it by degrees, until the minds of the people have time to be re-collected, that their under&s;tanding may have lei&s;ure to rally, and that more &s;teady councils may prevent their doing &s;omething de&s;perate under the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of rage or terror. But with regard to a <HI>general</HI> &s;tate of things, growing out of events and cau&s;es already known in the gro&s;s, there is no piety in the fraud that covers it's true nature; becau&s;e nothing but erroneous re&s;olutions can be the re&s;ult of fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e repre&s;entations. Tho&s;e mea&s;ures which in common di&s;tre&s;s might be available, in greater,
<PB N="19" REF="20">
are no better than playing with the evil. That the effort may bear a proportion to the exigence, it is fit it &s;hould be known; known in it's quality, in it's extent, and in all the circum&s;tances which at|tend it. Great rever&s;es of fortune, there have been, and great embarra&s;&s;ments in council: a princi|pled Regicide enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t important part of Europe and &s;truggling for the re&s;t: within our&s;elves a total relaxation of all authority, whil&s;t a cry is rai&s;ed again&s;t it, as if it were the mo&s;t fero|cious of all de&s;poti&s;in: a wor&s;e phaenomenon;&mdash;our government di&s;owned by the mo&s;t efficient member of it's tribunals; ill &s;upported by any of their con&s;ti|tuent parts; and the highe&s;t tribunal of all (from cau&s;es not for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to examine) deprived of all that dignity and all that efficiency which might enforce, or regulate, or if the ca&s;e required it, might &s;upply the want of every other court. Public pro|&s;ecutions are become little better than &s;chools for trea&s;on; of no u&s;e but to improve the dexterity of cri|minals in the my&s;tery of eva&s;ion; or to &s;hew with what compleat impunity men may con&s;pire again&s;t the Commonwealth; with what &s;afety a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins may at|tempt it's awful head. Every thing is &s;ecure, ex|cept what the laws have made &s;acred; every thing is tamene&s;s and languor that is not fury and fac|tion. Whil&s;t the di&s;tempers of a relaxed fibre progno&s;ticate and prepare all the morbid force of convul&s;ion in the body of the State the &s;teadine&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="21">
of the phy&s;ician is overpowered by the very a&s;pect of the di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Mu&s;&s;abat tacito medicina timore."</Q></NOTE> The doctor of the Con&s;titution, pre+tending to under-rate what he is not able to contend with, &s;hrinks from his own operation. He doubts and que&s;tions the &s;alutary but critical terrors of the cautery and the knife. He takes a poor credit even from his defeat; and covers impotence un|der the ma&s;k of lenity. He prai&s;es the moderation of the laws, as in his hands, he &s;ees them baf|fled and de&s;pi&s;ed. Is all this, becau&s;e in our day the &s;tatutes of the kingdom are not engro&s;&s;ed in as firm a character, and imprinted in as black and legible a type as ever? No! the law is a clear, but it is a dead letter. Dead and putrid, it is in&s;ufficient to &s;ave the State, but potent to infect, and to kill. Living law, full of rea&s;on, and of equity and ju&s;tice, (as it is, or it &s;hould not exi&s;t) ought to be &s;evere and awful too; or the words of menace, whether written on the parch|ment roll of England, or cut into the brazen ta|blet of Rome, will excite nothing but contempt. How comes it, that in all the State pro&s;ecutions of magnitude, from the Revolution to within the&s;e two or three years, the Crown has &s;carcely ever retired di&s;graced and defeated from it's Courts? Whence this alarming change? By a connexion ea|&s;ily felt, and not impo&s;&s;ible to be traced to it's cau&s;e, all the parts of the State have their corre&s;pon|dence
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and con&s;ent. They who bow to the enemy abroad will not be of power to &s;ubdue the con&s;pi|rator at home. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve, that in proportion as we approximate to the poi|&s;onous jaws of anarchy, the fa&s;cination grows ir|re&s;i&s;tible. In proportion as we are attracted to|wards the focus of illegality, irreligion, and de&s;|perate enterprize, all the venomous and blighting in&s;ects of the State are awakened into life. The promi&s;e of the year is bla&s;ted, and &s;hrivelled, and burned up before them. Our mo&s;t &s;alutary and mo&s;t beautiful in&s;titutions yield nothing but du&s;t and &s;mut: the harve&s;t of our law is no more than &s;tubble. It is in the nature of the&s;e eruptive di&s;|ea&s;es in the State to &s;ink in by fits and re-appear. But the fuel of the malady remains; and in my opinion is not in the &s;malle&s;t degree mitigated in it's malignity, though it waits the favourable mo|ment of a freer communication with the &s;ource of Regicide to exert and to encrea&s;e it's force.</P>
<P>Is it that the people are changed, that the Com|monwealth cannot be protected by its laws? I hardly think it. On the contrary, I conceive, that the&s;e things happen becau&s;e men are not changed, but re|main always what they always were; they remain what the bulk of us mu&s;t ever be, when abandoned to our vulgar propen&s;ities, without guide, leader or con|troul: That is, made to be full of a blind elevation in
<PB N="22" REF="23">
pro&s;perity; to de&s;pi&s;e untried dangers; to be over|powered with unexpected rever&s;es; to find no clue in a labyrinth of difficulties; to get out of a pre|&s;ent inconvenience with any ri&s;que of future ruin; to follow and to bow to fortune; to admire &s;uc|ce&s;sful though wicked enterprize, and to imitate what we admire: to contemn the government which announces danger from &s;acrilege and regi|cide, whil&s;t they are only in their infancy and their &s;truggle, but which finds nothing that can alarm in their adult &s;tate and in the power and triumph of tho&s;e de&s;tructive principles. In a ma&s;s we cannot be left to our&s;elves. We mu&s;t have leaders. If none will undertake to lead us right, we &s;hall find guides who will contrive to conduct us to &s;hame and ruin.</P>
<P>We are in a war of a <HI>peculiar</HI> nature. It is not with an ordinary community, which is ho&s;tile or friendly as pa&s;&s;ion or as intere&s;t may veer about; not with a State which makes war through wan|tonne&s;s, and abandons it through la&s;&s;itude. We are at war with a &s;y&s;tem, which, by it's e&s;&s;ence, is inimi|cal to all other Governments, and which makes peace or war, as peace and war may be&s;t con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ribute to their &s;ubver&s;ion. It is with an <HI>armed doctrine,</HI> that we are at war. It has, by it's e&s;&s;ence, a faction of opinion, and of intere&s;t, and of enthu&s;ia&s;m, in every country. To us it is a Colo&s;&s;us which be|&s;trides our channel. It has one foot on a foreign
<PB N="23" REF="24">
&s;hore, the other upon the Briti&s;h &s;oil. Thus ad|vantaged if it can at all exi&s;t, it mu&s;t finally pre|vail. Nothing can &s;o compleatly ruin any of the old Governments, ours in particular, as the ac|knowledgment, directly or by implication, of any kind of &s;uperiority in this new power. This ac|knowledgment we make, if in a bad or doubtful &s;ituation of our affairs, we &s;olicit peace; or if we yield to the modes of new humiliation, in which alone &s;he is content to give us an hearing. By that means the terms cannot be of our choo&s;ing; no, not in any part.</P>
<P>It is laid in the unalterable con&s;titution of things:&mdash;None can a&s;pire to act greatly, but tho&s;e who are of force greatly to &s;uffer. They who make their arrangements in the fir&s;t run of mi&s;ad|venture, and in a temper of mind the common fruit of di&s;appointment and di&s;may, put a &s;eal on their calamities. To their power they take a &s;e|curity again&s;t any favours which they might hope from the u&s;ual incon&s;tancy of fortune. I am there|fore, my dear friend, invariably of your opinion (though full of re&s;pect for tho&s;e who think diffe|rently) that neither the time cho&s;en for it, nor the manner of &s;oliciting a negotiation, were properly con&s;idered; even though I had allowed (I hardly &s;hall allow) that with the hord of Regicides we could by any &s;election of time, or u&s;e of means,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
obtain any thing at all de&s;erving the name of peace.</P>
<P>In one point we are lucky. The Regicide has received our advances with &s;corn. We have an enemy, to who&s;e virtues we can owe nothing; but on this occa&s;ion we are infinitely obliged to one of his vices. We owe more to his in&s;olence than to our own precaution. The haughtine&s;s by which the proud repel us, has this of good in it; that in making us keep our di&s;tance, they mu&s;t keep their di&s;tance too. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the pride of the Regicide may be our &s;afety. He has given time for our rea&s;on to operate; and for Bri|ti&s;h dignity to recover from it's &s;urpri&s;e. From fir&s;t to la&s;t he has rejected all our advances. Far as we have gone he has &s;till left a way open to our retreat.</P>
<P>There is always an augury to be taken of what a peace is likely to be, from the preliminary &s;teps that are made to bring it about. We may gather &s;omething from the time in which the fir&s;t over|tures are made; from the quarter whence they come; from the manner in which they are received. The&s;e di&s;cover the temper of the parties. If your enemy offers peace in the moment of &s;ucce&s;s, it indicates that he is &s;atisfied with &s;omething. It &s;hews that there are limits to his ambition or his
<PB N="25" REF="26">
re&s;entment. If he offers nothing under misfor|tune, it is probable, that it is more painful to him to abandon the pro&s;pect of advantage than to en|dure calamity. If he rejects &s;olicitation, and will not give even a nod to the &s;uppliants for peace, until a change in the fortune of the war threatens him with ruin, then I think it evident, that he wi&s;hes nothing more than to di&s;arm his adver&s;ary to gain time. Afterwards a que&s;tion ari&s;es, which of the parties is likely to obtain the greater ad|vantages, by continuing di&s;armed and by the u&s;e of time.</P>
<P>With the&s;e few plain indications in our minds, it will not be improper to re-con&s;ider the conduct of the enemy together with our own, from the day that a que&s;tion of peace has been in agitation. In con&s;idering this part of the que&s;tion, I do not proceed on my own hypothe&s;is. I &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that this body of Regicide, calling it&s;elf a Republick, is a politick per&s;on, with whom &s;omething de&s;erving the name of peace may be made. On that &s;uppo&s;ition, let us examine our own proceeding. Let us compute the profit it has brought, and the advantage that it is likely to bring hereafter. A peace too eagerly &s;ought, is not always the &s;ooner obtained. The di&s;covery of vehement wi&s;hes generally fru&s;trates their at|tainment; and your adver&s;ary has gained a great
<PB N="26" REF="27">
advantage over you when he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty. There is in re&s;erve, not only &s;omething of dignity, but a great deal of prudence too. A &s;ort of courage belongs to nego|tiation as well as to operations of the field. A negotiator mu&s;t often &s;eem willing to hazard the whole i&s;&s;ue of his treaty, if he wi&s;hes to &s;ecure any one material point.</P>
<P>The Regicides were the fir&s;t to declare war. We are the fir&s;t to &s;ue for peace. In proportion to the humility and per&s;everance we have &s;hewn in our addre&s;&s;es, has been the ob&s;tinacy of their arro|gance in rejecting our &s;uit. The patience of their pride &s;eems to have been worn out with the im|portunity of our court&s;hip. Di&s;gu&s;ted as they are with a conduct &s;o different from all the &s;entiments by which they are them&s;elves filled, they think to put an end to our vexatious &s;ollicitation by re|doubling their in&s;uits.</P>
<P>It happens frequently, that pride may reject a public advance, while intere&s;t li&s;tens to a &s;ecret &s;ugge&s;tion of advantage. The opportunity has been afforded. At a very early period in the diplo|macy of humiliation, a gentleman was &s;ent on an errand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bird &s;ent to &s;tate the real &s;ituation of the Duc de Choi&s;eul.</NOTE>, of which, from the motive of it, what|ever
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the event might be, we can never be a&s;hamed. Humanity cannot be degraded by humiliation. It is it's very character to &s;ubmit to &s;uch things. There is a con&s;anguinity between benevolence and humility. They are virtues of the &s;ame &s;tock. Dignity is of as good a race; but it belongs to the family of Fortitude. In the &s;pirit of that benevo|lence, we &s;ent a gentleman to be&s;eech the Direc|tory of Regicide, not to be quite &s;o prodigal as their Republick had been of judicial murder. We &s;olicited them to &s;pare the lives of &s;ome unhappy per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, who&s;e &s;afety at other times could not have been an object of &s;olicitation. They had quitted France on the faith of the declaration of the rights of citizens. They never had been in the &s;ervice of the Regicides, nor at their hands had received any &s;tipend. The very &s;y&s;tem and con|&s;titution of government that now prevails, was &s;et|tled &s;ub&s;equent to their emigration. They were under the protection of Great Britain, and in his Maje&s;ty's pay and &s;ervice. Not an ho&s;tile inva|&s;ion, but the di&s;a&s;ters of the &s;ea had thrown them upon a &s;hore, more barbarous and inho&s;pitable than the inclement ocean under the mo&s;t pitile&s;s of it's &s;torms. Here was an opportunity to expre&s;s a feeling for the mi&s;eries of war; and to open &s;ome &s;ort of conver&s;ation, which (after our publick over|tures had glutted their pride), at a cautious and jealous di&s;tance, might lead to &s;omething like an
<PB N="28" REF="29">
accommodation. What was the event? A &s;trange uncouth thing, a theatrical figure of the opera, his head &s;haded with three-coloured plumes, his body fanta&s;tically habited, &s;trutted from the back &s;cenes, and after a &s;hort &s;peech, in the mock-heroic fal&s;etto of &s;tupid tragedy, delivered the gentleman who came to make the repre&s;entation into the cu&s;tody of a guard, with directions not to lo&s;e &s;ight of him for a moment; and then ordered him to be &s;ent from Paris in two hours.</P>
<P>Here it is impo&s;&s;ible, that a &s;entiment of tender|ne&s;s &s;hould not &s;trike athwart the &s;ternne&s;s of po|liticks, and make us recal to painful memory, the difference between this in&s;olent and bloody theatre, and the temperate, natural maje&s;ty of a civilized court, where the afflicted family of A&s;gill did not in vain &s;olicit the mercy of the highe&s;t in rank, and the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate of the compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ex.</P>
<P>In this intercour&s;e, at lea&s;t, there was nothing to promi&s;e a great deal of &s;ucce&s;s in our future ad|vances. Whil&s;t the fortune of the field was wholly with the Regicides, nothing was thought of but to follow where it led; and it led to every thing. Not &s;o much as a talk of treaty. Laws were laid down with arrogance. The mo&s;t moderate politician
<PB N="29" REF="30">
in their clan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boi&s;ly d'Anglas.</NOTE> was cho&s;en as the organ, not &s;o much for pre&s;cribing limits to their claims, as to mark what, for the pre&s;ent, they are content to leave to others. They made, not laws, not Con|ventions, not late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but phy&s;ical nature, and political convenience, the &s;ole foundation of their claims. The Rhine, the Mediterra|nean, and the ocean were the bounds which, for the time, they a&s;&s;igned to the Empire of Regicide. What was the Chamber of Union of Louis the Fourteenth, which a&s;toni&s;hed and provoked all Europe, compared to this declara|tion? In truth, with the&s;e limits, and their prin|ciple, they would not have left even the &s;hadow of liberty or &s;afety to any nation. This plan of em|pire was not taken up in the fir&s;t intoxication of unexpected &s;ucce&s;s. You mu&s;t recollect, that it was projected, ju&s;t as the report has &s;tated it, from the very fir&s;t revolt of the faction again&s;t their Monarchy; and it has been uniformly pur&s;ued, as a &s;tanding maxim of national policy, from that time to this. It is, generally, in the &s;ea&s;on of pro&s;|perity that men di&s;cover their real temper, prin|ciples, and de&s;igns. But this principle &s;ug|ge&s;ted in their fir&s;t &s;truggles, fully avowed in their pro&s;perity, has, in the mo&s;t adver&s;e &s;tate of their affairs, been tenaciou&s;ly adhered to. The report,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
combined with their conduct, forms an infallible criterion of the views of this Republick.</P>
<P>In their fortune there has been &s;ome fluctuation. We are to &s;ee how their minds have been af|fected with a change. Some impre&s;&s;ion it made on them undoubtedly. It produced &s;ome oblique notice of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions that were made by &s;up|pliant nations. The utmo&s;t they did, was to make &s;ome of tho&s;e cold, formal, general profe&s;&s;ions of a love of peace which no Power has ever refu&s;ed to make; becau&s;e they mean little, and co&s;t nothing. The fir&s;t paper I have &s;een (the publication at Hamburgh) making a &s;hew of that pacific di&s;po|&s;ition, di&s;covered a rooted animo&s;ity again&s;t this nation, and an incurable rancour, even more than any one of their ho&s;tile acts. In this Ham|burgh declaration, they choo&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e, that the war, on the part of England, <HI>is a war of Go|vernment, begun and carried on again&s;t the &s;en&s;e and intere&s;ts of the people</HI>; thus &s;owing in their very overtures towards peace, the &s;eeds of tumult and &s;edition: for they never have abandoned, and never will they abandon, in peace, in war, in treaty, in any &s;ituation, or for one in&s;tant, their old &s;teady maxim of &s;eparating the people from their Go|vernment. Let me add&mdash;and it is with unfeign|ed anxiety for the character and credit of Mi|ni&s;ters that I do add&mdash;if our Government per|&s;everes,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
in its as uniform cour&s;e, of acting un|der in&s;truments with &s;uch preambles, it pleads guilty to the charges made by our enemies again&s;t it, both on it's own part, and on the part of par|liament it&s;elf. The enemy mu&s;t &s;ucceed in his plan for loo&s;ening and di&s;connecting all the inter|nal holdings of the kingdom.</P>
<P>It was not enough, that the Speech from the Throne in the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion in 1795, threw out oglings and glances of tenderne&s;s. Le&s;t this coquetting &s;hould &s;eem too cold and ambigu|ous, without waiting for it's effect, the violent pa&s;|&s;ion for a relation to the Regicides, produced a di|rect Me&s;&s;age from the Crown, and it's con&s;equences from the two Hou&s;es of Parliament. On the part of the Regicides the&s;e declarations could not be entirely pa&s;&s;ed by without notice: but in that notice they di&s;covered &s;till more clearly the bot|tom of their character. The offer made to them by the me&s;&s;age to Parliament was hinted at in their an&s;wer; but in an ob&s;cure and ob|lique manner as before. They accompanied their notice of the indications manife&s;ted on our &s;ide, with every kind of in&s;olent and taunting reflec|tion. The Regicide Directory, on the day which, in their gip&s;ey jargon, they call the 5th of Pluvio&s;e, in return for our advances, charge us with elud|ing our declarations under <Q REND="inline">"eva&s;ive formalities
<PB N="32" REF="33">
and frivolous pretexts."</Q>What the&s;e pretexts and eva&s;ions were, they do not &s;ay, and I have never heard. But they do not re&s;t there. They pro|ceed to charge us, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, our allies in the ma&s;s, with direct <HI>perfidy</HI>; they are &s;o conciliatory in their language as to hint that this perfidious character is not new in our proceedings. However, notwith&s;tanding this our habitual per|fidy, they will offer peace <Q REND="inline">"on conditions <HI>as</HI> mo|derate"</Q>&mdash;as what? as rea&s;on and as equity re|quire? No! as moderate <Q REND="inline">"as are &s;uitable to their <HI>national dignity.</HI>"</Q> National dignity in all treaties I do admit is an important con&s;ideration. They have given us an u&s;eful hint on that &s;ubject: but dignity, hitherto, has belonged to the mode of proceeding, not to the matter of a treaty. Ne|ver before has it been mentioned as the &s;tandard for rating the conditions of peace; no, never by the mo&s;t violent of conquerors. Indemnification is capable of &s;ome e&s;timate; dignity has no &s;tandard. It is impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s what acqui&s;itions pride and ambition may think fit for their <HI>dignity.</HI> But le&s;t any doubt &s;hould remain on what they think for their dignity, the Regicides in the next paragraph tell us <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that they will have no peace with their enemies, until they have reduced them to a &s;tate, which will put them under an <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> of pur&s;uing their wretched projects;"</Q> that is, in plain French or Engli&s;h, until they have accom|pli&s;hed
<PB N="33" REF="34">
our utter and irretrievable ruin. This is their <HI>pacific</HI> language. It flows from their unalter|able principle in whatever language they &s;peak, or whatever &s;teps they take, whether of real war, or of pretended pacification. They have never, to do them ju&s;tice, been at much trouble in concealing their intentions. We were as ob&s;tinately re|&s;olved to think them not in earne&s;t: but I confe&s;s je&s;ts of this &s;ort, whatever their urbanity may be, are not much to my ta&s;te.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="35">
&s;unk on the down of u&s;urped pomp, he &s;hall have &s;ufficiently indulged his meditations with what Monarch he &s;hall next glut his ravening maw, he may conde&s;cend to &s;ignify that it his plea&s;ure to be awake; and that he is at lei&s;ure to receive the pro|po&s;als of his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may re&s;pite the execution of the &s;en|tence he has pa&s;&s;ed upon them. At the opening of tho&s;e doors, what a &s;ight it mu&s;t be to behold the plenipotentiarie of royal impotence, in the prece|dency which they will intrigue to obtain, and which will be granted to them according to the &s;eniority of their degradation, &s;neaking into the Regicide pre&s;ence, and with the reliques of the &s;mile, which they had dre&s;&s;ed up for the levee of their ma&s;ters, &s;till flickering on their curled lips, pre&s;enting the faded remains of their courtly graces, to meet the &s;cornful, ferocious, &s;ardonic grin of a bloody ruffian, who, whil&s;t he is receiving their homage, is mea&s;uring them with his eye, and fitting to their &s;ize the &s;lider of his Guillotine! The&s;e amba&s;&s;a|dors may ea&s;ily return as good courtiers as they went; but can they ever return from that degrad|ing re&s;idence, loyal and faithful &s;ubjects; or with any true affection to their ma&s;ter, or true attach|ment to the con&s;titution, religion, or laws of their country? There is great dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er that they who enter &s;miling into this Prophonian Cave, will come out of it &s;ad and &s;erious con&s;pirators; and
<PB N="35" REF="36">
&s;uch will continue as long as they live. They will become true conductors of contagion to eve|ry country, which has had the misfortune to &s;end them to the &s;ource of that electricity. At be&s;t they will become totally indifferent to good and evil, to one in&s;titution or another. This &s;pecies of indifference is but too generally di&s;tingui&s;hable in tho&s;e who have been much em|ployed in foreign Courts; but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the evil mu&s;t be aggravated without mea&s;ure; for they go from their country, not with the pride of the old character, but in a &s;tate of the lowe&s;t degra|dation; and what mu&s;t happen in their place of re&s;i|dence can have no effect in rai&s;ing them to the le|vel of true dignity, or of cha&s;te &s;elf e&s;timation, either as men, or as repre&s;entatives of crowned heads.</P>
<P>Our early proceeding, which has prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ced the&s;e returns of affront, appeared to me totally new, with|out being adapted to the new circum&s;tances of affairs. I have called to my mind the &s;peeches and me&s;&s;ages in former times. I find nothing like the&s;e. You will look in the journals to find whe|ther my memory fails me. Before this time, never was a ground of peace laid, (as it were, in a parlia|mentary record,) until it had been as good as con|cluded. This was a wi&s;e homage paid to the di&s;|cretion of the Crown. It was known how much
<PB N="36" REF="37">
a negotiation mu&s;t &s;uffer by having any thing in the train towards it prematurely di&s;clo&s;ed. But when tho&s;e parliamentary declarations were made, not &s;o much as a &s;tep had been taken towards a negotiation in any mode whatever. The mea&s;ure was an unplea&s;ant and un&s;ea&s;onable di&s;covery.</P>
<P>I conceive that another circum&s;tance in that tran&s;action has been as little authori&s;ed by any ex|ample; and that it is as little prudent in it&s;elf; I mean the formal recognition of the French Re|publick. Without entering, for the pre&s;ent, into a que&s;tion on the good faith manife&s;ted in that mea&s;ure, or on it's general policy, I doubt, upon mere temporary con&s;iderations of prudence, whe|ther it was perfectly advi&s;eable. It is not within the rules of dexterous conduct to make an ac|knowledgment of a conte&s;ted title in your enemy, before you are morally certain that your recogni|tion will &s;ecure his friend&s;hip. Otherwi&s;e it is a mea&s;ure wor&s;e than thrown away. It adds infi|nitely to the &s;trength, and con&s;equently to the de|mands of the adver&s;e party. He has gained a fundamental point without an equivalent. It has happened as might have been fore&s;een. No no|tice whatever was taken of this recognition. In fact, the Directory never gave them&s;elves any con|cern about it; and they received our acknowledg|ment with perfect &s;corn. With them, it is not for
<PB N="37" REF="38">
the States of Europe to judge of their title: But in their eye the title of every other power depends wholly on their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Preliminary declarations of this &s;ort, thrown out at random, and &s;own, as it were, broad-ca&s;t, were never to be found in the mode of our pro|ceeding with France and Spain, whil&s;t the great Monarchies of France and Spain exi&s;ted. I do not &s;ay, that a diplomatick mea&s;ure ought to be, like a parliamentary or a judicial proceeding, according to &s;trict precedent. I hope I am far from that pedantry: But this I know, that a great &s;tate ought to have &s;ome regard to it's antient maxims; e&s;pecially where they indicate it's dignity; where they concur with the rules of prudence; and above all, where the circum&s;tances of the time require that a &s;pirit of innovation &s;hould be re&s;i&s;ted, which leads to the humiliation of &s;overeign powers. It would be ridiculous to a&s;&s;ert, that tho&s;e powers have &s;uffered nothing in their e&s;timation. I admit, that the greater intere&s;ts of &s;tate will for a moment &s;uper&s;ede all other con&s;iderations: but if there was a rule that a &s;overeign never &s;hould let down his dignity without a &s;ure payment to his intere&s;t, the dignity of Kings would be held high enough. At pre&s;ent, however, fa&s;hion governs in more &s;e|rious things than furniture and dre&s;s. It looks as if &s;overeigns abroad were emulous in bidding
<PB N="38" REF="39">
again&s;t their e&s;timation. It &s;eems as if the pre-emi|nence of Regicide was acknowledged; and that Kings tacitly ranked them&s;elves below their &s;acri|legious murderers, as natural magi&s;trates and judges over them. It appears as if dignity were the prerogative of crime; and a tempori&s;ing humiliation the proper part for venerable authority. If the vile&s;t of mankind are re&s;olved to be the mo&s;t wick|ed, they lo&s;e all the ba&s;ene&s;s of their origin, and take their place above Kings. This example in fo|reign Princes, I tru&s;t, will not &s;pread. It is the concern of mankind, that the de&s;truction of order &s;hould not be a claim to rank: that crimes &s;hould not be the only title to pre-eminence and honour.</P>
<P>At this &s;econd &s;tage of humiliation, (I mean the in&s;ulting declaration in con&s;equence of the me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es of Parliament) it might not have been ami&s;s to pau&s;e; and not to &s;quander away the fund of our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, until we know what final purpo&s;es of publick intere&s;t they might an&s;wer. The policy of &s;ubjecting our&s;elves to fur|ther in&s;ults is not to me quite apparent. It was re&s;olved however, to hazard a third trial. Citizen Barthelemi had been e&s;tabli&s;hed on the part of the new Republick, at Ba&s;ie; where, with his procon|&s;ulate of Switzerland and the adjacent parts of Ger+many, he was appointed as a &s;ort of factor to deal in the degradation of the crowned heads of Europe.

<P>On the part of Great Britain this mea&s;ure was a voluntary act, wholly uncalled for on the part of Regicide.

<P>This refu&s;al of treating conjointly with the pow|ers allied again&s;t this Republick, furni&s;hes matter for a great deal of &s;erious reflexion.

<PB N="41" REF="42">
from the herd, each power is treated with, on the merit of his being a de&s;erter from the common cau&s;e. In that light the Regicide power finding each of them in&s;ulated and unprotected, with great facility gives the law to them all. By this &s;y&s;tem for the pre&s;ent, an incurable di&s;tru&s;t is &s;own among&s;t confederates; and in future all alliance is rendered impracticable. It is thus they have treated with Pru&s;&s;ia, with Spain, with Sardinia, with Bavaria, with the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, with Saxony; and here we &s;ee them refu&s;e to treat with Great Britain in any other mode.

our humbled country. Their openne&s;s and can|dour con&s;i&s;t in a direct avowal of their de&s;poti&s;m and ambition.

As to what &s;he has conquered from the allies and united to the &s;ame indivi&s;ible body, it is of the &s;ame nature. That is, the allies are to give up whatever conque&s;ts they have made or may make upon France, but all which &s;he has vio|lently ravi&s;hed from her neighbours and thought fit to appropriate, are not to become &s;o much as objects of negociation.</P>
<P>In this unity and indivi&s;ibility of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are &s;unk ten immen&s;e and wealthy provinces, full of &s;trong, flouri&s;hing and opulent cities, (the Au&s;trian Netherlands,) the part of Europe the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve any communication between this king|dom and its natural allies, next to Holland the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to this country, and without which Holland mu&s;t virtually belong to France.

by any equivalent. Why? becau&s;e there is a law which prevents it. What law? The law of nations? The acknowledged public law of Europe? Treaties and conventions of parties? No! not a pretence of the kind. It is a declaration not made in con&s;e|quence of any pre&s;cription on her &s;ide, not on any ce&s;&s;ion or dereliction, actual or tacit, of other pow|ers. It is a declaration <HI>pendente lite</HI> in the middle of a war, one principal object of which was origi|nally the defence, and has &s;ince been the recovery of the&s;e very countries.</P>
<P>This &s;trange law is not made for a trivial object, not for a &s;ingle port, or for a &s;ingle fortre&s;s; but for a great kingdom; for the religion, the morals, the laws, the liberties, the lives and fortunes of millions of human creatures, who without their con&s;ent, or that of their lawful government, are, by an arbitrary act of this regicide and homicide Government, which they call a law, incorporated into their tyranny.</P>
<P>In other words, their will is the law, not only at home, but as to the concerns of every na|tion. Who has made that law but the Regicide Republick it&s;elf, who&s;e laws, like tho&s;e of the Medes and Per&s;ians, they cannot alter or abrogate, or even &s;o much as take into con&s;ideration? With|out the lea&s;t ceremony or compliment, they have

&s;ent out of the world whole &s;ets of laws and law|givers. They have &s;wept away the very con&s;titu|tions under which the Legi&s;latures acted, and the Laws were made.

mankind. It is an authority that on a thou&s;and oc|ca&s;ions they have a&s;&s;erted in claim, and whenever they are able, exerted in practice.

<P>It was of cour&s;e, that we &s;hould wait until the enemy &s;hewed &s;ome &s;ort of di&s;po&s;ition on his part to fulfil this condition.

Every demon&s;tration of an implacable rancour and an untameable pride were the only encouragements we received to the renewal of our &s;upplications.</P>
<P>Here therefore they and we were fixed.

This re&s;olution was &s;oon, however, forgot. It felt the heat of the &s;ea&s;on and melted away. New hopes were entertained from &s;upplication. No expectations, indeed, were then formed from renewing a direct application to the French Regicides through the Agent General for the humiliation of Sovereigns. At length a &s;tep was taken in degradation which even went lower than all the re&s;t. Deficient in merits of our own, a Mediator was to be &s;ought&mdash;and we looked for that Mediator at Berlin!

<P><PB N="49" REF="50">If humiliation is the element in which we live, if it is become not only our occa&s;ional policy but our habit, no great objection can be made to the modes in which it may be diver&s;ified; though, I confe&s;s, I cannot be charmed with the idea of our expo&s;ing our lazar &s;ores at the door of every proud &s;ervitor of the French Republick, where the court-dogs will not deign to lick them.

I &s;hall only ob&s;erve upon it <HI>politically,</HI> and as furni&s;hing a direction for our own conduct in this low bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The very idea of a negociation for peace, what|ever the inward &s;entiments of the parties may be, implies &s;ome confidence in their faith, &s;ome de|gree of belief in the profe&s;&s;ions which are made concerning it. A temporary and occa&s;ional credit, at lea&s;t, is granted. Otherwi&s;e men &s;tumble on the very thre&s;hold. I therefore wi&s;h to a&s;k what hope we can have of their good faith, who, as the very ba&s;is of the negociation, a&s;&s;ume the ill faith and treachery of tho&s;e they have to deal with? The terms, as again&s;t us, mu&s;t be &s;uch as imply a full &s;ecurity again&s;t a treacherous conduct&mdash;that is, &s;uch terms as this Directory &s;tated in it's fir&s;t de|claration, to place us <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in an utter impo&s;&s;ibility of executing our wretched projects."</Q> This is the omen, and the &s;ole omen, under which we have con&s;ented to open our treaty.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ob&s;ervation I have to make upon it, (much connected undoubtedly with the fir&s;t,) is, that they have informed you of the re&s;ult they propo&s;e from the kind of peace they mean to grant you; that is to &s;ay, the union they propo&s;e among
<PB N="54" REF="55">
nations with the view, of rivalling our trade and de&s;troying our naval power: and this they &s;up|po&s;e (and with good rea&s;on too) mu&s;t be the inevitable effect of their peace. It forms one of their principal grounds for &s;u&s;pecting our Mini|&s;ters could not be in good earne&s;t in their propo|&s;ition. They make no &s;cruple beforehand to tell you the whole of what they intend; and this is what we call, in the modern &s;tyle, the acceptance of a propo&s;ition for peace! In old language it would be called a mo&s;t haughty, offen&s;ive, and in|&s;olent rejection of all treaty.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they tell you what they conceive to be the perfidious policy which dictates your delu&s;ive offer; that is, the de&s;ign of cheating not only them, but the people of England, again&s;t who&s;e intere&s;t and inclination this war is &s;uppo&s;ed to be carried on.</P>
<P>If we proceed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, under this preli|minary declaration, it &s;eems to me, that we admit, (now for the third time) by &s;omething a great deal &s;tronger than words, the truth of the charges of every kind which they make upon the Briti&s;h Mi|ni&s;try, and the grounds of tho&s;e foul imputations. The language u&s;ed by us, which in other circum|&s;tances would not be exceptionable, in this ca&s;e tends very &s;trongly to confirm and realize the &s;u&s;|picion
<PB N="55" REF="56">
of our enemy. I mean the declaration, that if we do not obtain &s;uch terms of peace as &s;uits our opinion of what our intere&s;ts require, <HI>then,</HI> and in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e, we &s;hall continue the war with vigour. This offer &s;o rea&s;oned plainly implies, that without it, our leaders them&s;elves entertain great doubts of the opinion and good affections of the Briti&s;h people; otherwi&s;e there does not appear any cau&s;e, why we &s;hould proceed under the &s;can|dalous con&s;truction of our enemy, upon the for|mer offer made by Mr. Wickham, and on the new offer made directly at Paris. It is not, there|fore, from a &s;en&s;e of dignity, but from the danger of radicating that fal&s;e &s;entiment in the brea&s;ts of the enemy, that I think, under the au&s;pices of this declaration, we cannot, with the lea&s;t hope of a good event, or, indeed, with any regard to the common &s;afety, proceed in the train of this nego|ciation. I wi&s;h Mini&s;try would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the importance of their &s;eeming to confirm the enemy in an opinion, that his frequent u&s;e of ap|peals to the people again&s;t their Government has not been without it's effect. If it puts an end to this war, it will render another impracticable.</P>
<P>Whoever goes to the directorial pre&s;ence under this pa&s;&s;port, with this offen&s;ive comment, and foul explanation, goes, in the avowed &s;en&s;e of the Court to which he is &s;ent; as the in&s;trument of a

On three other points
<PB N="57" REF="58">
which run through all their declarations, they are more explicit than ever.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they more directly undertake to be the real repre&s;entatives of the people of this kingdom: and on a &s;uppo&s;ition in which they agree with our parliamentary reformers, that the Hou&s;e of Com|mons is not that Repre&s;entative, the function be|ing vacant, they, as our true con&s;titutional organ, inform his Maje&s;ty and the world of the &s;en&s;e of the nation. They tell us that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Engli&s;h people &s;ee with regret his Maje&s;ty's Government &s;quandering away the funds which had been granted to him."</Q> This a&s;toni&s;hing a&s;&s;umption of the publick voice of England, is but a &s;light foreta&s;te of the u&s;urpation which, on a peace, we may be a&s;&s;ured they will make of all the powers in all the parts of our va&s;|&s;al con&s;titution. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If they do the&s;e things in the green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry?"</Q></P>
<P>Next they tell us as a condition to our treaty, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this Government mu&s;t abjure the unju&s;t ha|tred it bears to them, and at la&s;t open it's ears to the voice of humanity."</Q>&mdash;Truely this is, even from them, an extraordinary demand.

It is not difficult to di&s;cern what &s;ort of humanity our Government is to learn from the&s;e &s;yren &s;ingers.

<P>Strange revolutions have happened in the ways of thinking and in the feelings of men: But, it re|quires a very extraordinary coalition of parties indeed, and a kind of unheard-of unanimity in publick Councils, which can impo&s;e this new-di&s;covered

<P>I know it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that if good terms of capitulation are not granted, after we have thus &s;o repeatedly hung out the white flag, the national &s;pirit will revive with tenfold ardour. This is an experiment cautiou&s;ly to be made. <HI>Reculer pour mieux &s;outer,</HI> according to the French by|word, cannot be tru&s;ted to as a general rule of con|duct. To diet a man into weakne&s;s and languor, afterwards to give him the greater &s;trength, has more of the empirick than the rational phy&s;ician. It is true that &s;ome per&s;ons have been kicked into courage; and this is no bad hint to give to tho&s;e who are too forward and liberal in be&s;towing in|&s;ults and outrages on their pa&s;&s;ive companions. But &s;uch a cour&s;e does not at fir&s;t view appear a well-cho&s;en di&s;cipline to form men to a nice &s;en&s;e of honour, or a quick re&s;entment of injuries. A long habit of humiliation does not &s;eem a very good preparative to manly and vigorous &s;enti|ment. It may not leave, perhaps, enough of energy in the mind fairly to di&s;cern what are good

terms or what are not. Men low and di&s;pirited may regard tho&s;e terms as not at all ami&s;s, which in another &s;tate of mind they would think intoler|able: if they grow peevi&s;h in this &s;tate of mind, they may be rou&s;ed, not again&s;t the enemy whom they have been taught to fear, but again&s;t the Mini&s;try<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ut lethargicus hic, cum fit pugil, et medicum urget.&mdash;HOR.</NOTE>, who are more within their reach, and who have refu&s;ed conditions that are not un&s;ea&s;onable, from power that they have been taught to con&s;ider as irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>If all that for &s;ome months I have heard have the lea&s;t foundation, I hope it has not, the Mini&s;ters are, perhaps, not quite &s;o much to be blamed, as their condition is to be lamented.

It is &s;trange, but it may be true, that as the danger from Jacobini&s;m is increa&s;ed in my eyes and in yours, the fear of it is le&s;&s;ened in the eyes of many people who formerly regarded it with horror.

in their own patrioti&s;m and their own courage. They are willing to tru&s;t to the &s;ympathy of Re|gicides, the guarantee of the Briti&s;h Monarchy.

<P>In matters of State, a con&s;titutional competence to act, is in many ca&s;es the &s;malle&s;t part of the que&s;tion. Without di&s;puting (God forbid I &s;hould di&s;pute) the &s;ole competence of the King and the Parliament, each in it's province, to decide on war and peace, I venture to &s;ay, no war <HI>can</HI> be long carried on again&s;t the will of the people. This war, in particular, cannot be carried on unle&s;s they are enthu&s;ia&s;tically in favour of it. Acquie&s;cence will not do. There mu&s;t be zeal. Univer&s;al zeal in &s;uch a cau&s;e, and at &s;uch a time as this is, cannot be looked for; neither is it nece&s;&s;ary. A zeal in the larger part carries the force of the whole. Without this, no Government, certainly not our Government, is capable of a great war. None of the ancient regular Governments have wherewithal
<PB N="66" REF="67">
to fight abroad with a foreign foe, and at home to overcome repining, reluctance, and chicane. It mu&s;t be &s;ome portentous thing&punc; like Regicide France, that can exhibit &s;uch a prodigy. Yet even &s;he, the mother of mon&s;ters, more prolifick than the country of old called <HI>Ferax mon&s;trorum,</HI> &s;hews &s;ymptoms of being almo&s;t effete already; and &s;he will be &s;o, unle&s;s the fallow of a peace comes to recruit her fertility. But whatever may be repre&s;ented concerning the meanne&s;s of the po|pular &s;pirit, I, for one, do not think &s;o de&s;perately of the Briti&s;h nation. Our minds, as I &s;aid, are light, but they are not depraved. We are dread|fully open to delu&s;ion and to dejection; but we are capable of being animated and undeceived.</P>
<P>It cannot be concealed. We are a divided peo|ple. But in divi&s;ions, where a part is to be taken, we are to make a mu&s;ter of our &s;trength. I have often endeavoured to compute and to cla&s;s tho&s;e who, in any political view, are to be called the peo|ple. Without doing &s;omething of this &s;ort we mu&s;t proceed ab&s;urdly. We &s;hould not be much wi&s;er, if we pretended to very great accuracy in our e&s;timate: But I think, in the calculation I have made, the error cannot be very material. In England and Scotland, I compute that tho&s;e of adult age, not declining in life, of tolerable lei&s;ure for &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and of &s;ome means of infor|mation,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
more or le&s;s, and who are above mental dependence, (or what virtually is &s;uch) may amount to about four hundred thou&s;and. There is &s;uch a thing as a natural repre&s;entative of the people. This body is that repre&s;entative; and on this body&punc; more than on the legal con&s;tituent, the artificial re|pre&s;entative depends. This is the Briti&s;h pub|lick; and it is a publick very numerous. The re&s;t, when feeble, are the objects of protection; when &s;trong, the means of force. They who affect to con&s;ider that part of us in any other light, in|&s;ult while they cajole us; they do not want us for coun&s;ellors in deliberation, but to li&s;t us as &s;ol|diers for battle.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e four hundred thou&s;and political citi|zens, I look upon one fifth, or about eighty thou|&s;and, to be pure Jacobins; utterly incapable of amendment; objects of eternal vigilance; and when they break out, of legal con&s;traint. On the&s;e, no rea&s;on, no argument, no example, no vene|rable authority, can have the &s;lighte&s;t influence. They de&s;ire a change; and they will have it if they can. If they cannot have it by Engli&s;h cabal, they will make no &s;ort of &s;cruple of having it by the cabal of France, into which already they are virtually incorporated. It is only their a&s;&s;ured and confident expectation of the advantages of French fraternity and the approaching ble&s;&s;ings of

Regicide intercour&s;e, that &s;kins over their mi&s;|chievous di&s;po&s;itions with a momentary quiet.</P>
<P>This minority is great and formidable. I do not know whether if I aimed at the total over|throw of a kingdom, I &s;hould wi&s;h to be encum|bered with a larger body of partizans. They are more ea&s;ily di&s;ciplined and directed than if the number were greater. The&s;e, by their &s;pirit of intrigue, and by their re&s;tle&s;s agitating activity, are of a force far &s;uperior to their num|bers; and if times grew the lea&s;t critical, have the means of debauching or intimidating many of tho&s;e who are now &s;ound, as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more pa&s;&s;ive part of the nation. This minority is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace, or for war, or for any object they are led vehemently to de&s;ire. By pa&s;|&s;ing from place to place with a velocity incredible, and diver&s;ifying their character and de&s;cription, they are capable of mimicking the general voice. We mu&s;t not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noi&s;e of the acclamation.</P>
<P>The majority, the other four fifths, is perfectly &s;ound; and of the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition to re|ligion, to government, to the true and undivided intere&s;t of their country. Such men are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to peace. They who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="69" REF="70">
of all they wi&s;h are languid and improvident. With this fault, (and I admit it's exi&s;tence in all it's extent) they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of every thing for which peace is dear to them. However, the de&s;ire of peace is e&s;&s;entially the weak &s;ide of that kind of men. All men that are ruined, are ruined on the &s;ide of their natural propen&s;ities. There they are un|guarded. Above all, good men do not &s;u&s;pect that their de&s;truction is attempted through their virtues. This their enemies are perfectly aware of: And accordingly, they, the mo&s;t turbulent of mankind, who never made a &s;cruple to &s;hake the tranquil|lity of their country to it's center, rai&s;e a continual cry for peace with France. Peace with Regicide, and war with the re&s;t of the world, is their motto. From the beginning, and even whil&s;t the French gave the blows, and we hardly oppo&s;ed the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> to their efforts, from that day to this hour, like importunate Guinea-fowls crying one note day and night, they have called for peace.</P>
<P>In this they are, as I confe&s;s in all things they are, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent. They who wi&s;h to unite them&s;elves to your enemies, naturally de&s;ire, that you &s;hould di&s;arm your&s;elf by a peace with the&s;e enemies. But it pa&s;&s;es my conception, how they, who wi&s;h well to their country on it's antient &s;y&s;|tem
<PB N="70" REF="71">
of laws and manners, come not to be doubly alarmed, when they find nothing but a clamor for peace, in the mouths of the men on earth the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to it in their natural or in their habitual character.</P>
<P>I have a good opinion of the general abilities of the Jacobins: not that I &s;uppo&s;e them better born than others; but &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions awaken the facul|ties. They &s;uffer not a particle of the man to be lo&s;t. The &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e gives to this de&s;cription the full u&s;e of all their native energies. If I have rea&s;on to conceive that my enemy, who, as &s;uch, mu&s;t have an intere&s;t in my de&s;truction, is al&s;o a per&s;on of di&s;cernment and &s;agacity, then I mu&s;t be quite &s;ure, that in a conte&s;t, the object he vio|lently pur&s;ues, is the very thing by which my ruin is likely to be the mo&s;t perfectly accompli&s;hed. Why do the Jacobins cry for peace? Becau&s;e they know, that this point gained, the re&s;t will follow of cour&s;e. On our part, why are all the rules of prudence, as &s;ure as the laws of material nature, to be at this time rever&s;ed? How comes it, that now for the fir&s;t time, men think it right to be governed by the coun&s;els of their enemies? Ought they not rather to tremble, when they are per&s;uaded to tra|vel on the &s;ame road; and to tend to the &s;ame place of re&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">The minority I &s;peak of, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of an impre&s;&s;ion from the topics of argument, to be u&s;ed to the larger part of the community. I therefore do not addre&s;s to them any part of what I have to &s;ay. The more forcibly I drive my arguments again&s;t their &s;y&s;tem, &s;o as to make an impre&s;&s;ion where I wi&s;h to make it, the more &s;trongly I rivet them in their &s;entiments. As for us, who compo&s;e the far larger, and what I call the far better part of the people; let me &s;ay, that we have not been quite fairly dealt with when called to this deli|beration. The Jacobin minority have been abun|dantly &s;upplied with &s;tores and provi&s;ions of all kinds towards their warfare. No &s;ort of argumen|tative materials, &s;uited to their purpo&s;es, have been withheld. Fal&s;e they are, un&s;ound, &s;ophi&s;tical; but they are regular in their direction. They all bear one way; and they all go to the &s;upport of the &s;ub&s;tantial merits of their cau&s;e. The others have not had the que&s;tion &s;o much as fairly &s;tated to them.</P>
<P>There has not been in this century, any foreign peace or war, in it's origin, the fruit of popular de&s;ire; except the war that was made with Spain in 1739. Sir Robert Walpole was forced into the war by the people, who were inflamed to this mea&s;ure by the mo&s;t leading politicians, by the fir&s;t orators, and the greate&s;t poets of
<PB N="72" REF="73">
the time. For that war, Pope &s;ung his dying notes. For that war, John&s;on, in more energetic &s;trains, employed the voice of his early genius. For that war, Glover di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the way in which his mu&s;e was the mo&s;t natural and happy. The crowd readily followed the politi|cians in the cry for a war, which threatened little blood&s;hed, and which promi&s;ed victories that were attended with &s;omething more &s;olid than glory. A war with Spain was a war of plunder. In the pre&s;ent conflict with Regicide, Mr. Pitt has not hitherto had, nor will perhaps for a few days have, many prizes to hold out in the lottery of war, to tempt the lower part of our character. He can only maintain it by an ap|peal to the higher; and to tho&s;e, in whom that higher part is the mo&s;t predominant, he mu&s;t look the mo&s;t for his &s;upport. Whil&s;t he holds out no inducements to the wi&s;e, nor bribes to the avari|cious, he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace ten times more ruinous than the mo&s;t di&s;|a&s;trous war. The weaker he is in the fund of mo|tives which apply to our avarice, to our lazine&s;s, and to our la&s;&s;itude, if he means to carry the war to any end at all, the &s;tronger he ought to be in his addre&s;&s;es to our magnanimity and to our rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In &s;tating that Walpole was driven by a popular clamour into a mea&s;ure not to be ju&s;tified, I do
<PB N="78" REF="74">
not mean wholly to excu&s;e his conduct. My time of ob&s;ervation did not exactly coincide with that event; but I read much of the controver&s;ies then carried on. Several years after the conte&s;ts of par|ties had cea&s;ed, the people were amu&s;ed, and in a degree warmed with them. The events of that aera &s;eemed then of magnitude, which the revolu|tions of our time have reduced to parochial im|portance; and the debates, which then &s;hook the nation, now appear of no higher moment than a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in a ve&s;try. When I was very young, a general fa&s;hion told me I was to admire &s;ome of the writings again&s;t that Mini&s;ter; a little more maturity taught me as much to de&s;pi&s;e them. I ob&s;erved one fault in his general proceeding. He never manfully put forward the entire &s;trength of his cau&s;e. He tempori&s;ed; he managed; and adopting very nearly the &s;entiments of his adver&s;aries, he oppo&s;ed their inferences. This, for a po|litical commander, is the choice of a weak po&s;t. His adver&s;aries had the better of the argument, as he handled it, not as the rea&s;on and ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e enabled him to manage it. I &s;ay this, after having &s;een, and with &s;ome care examined, the ori|ginal documents concerning certain important tran&s;actions of tho&s;e times. They perfectly &s;atisfied me of the extreme inju&s;tice of that war, and of the fal&s;ehood of the colours, which to his own ruin, and guided by a mi&s;taken policy, he &s;uf|fered
<PB N="74" REF="75">
to be daubed over that mea&s;ure. Some years after, it was my fortune to conver&s;e with many of the principal actors again&s;t that Mini&s;ter, and with tho&s;e, who principally excited that clamour. None of them, no not one, did in the lea&s;t defend the mea&s;ure, or attempt to ju&s;tify their conduct. They condemned it as freely as they would have done in commenting upon any proceeding in hi&s;|tory, in which they were totally unconcerned. Thus it will be. They who &s;tir up the people to improper de&s;ires, whether of peace or war, will be condemned by them&s;elves. They who weakly yield to them will be condemned by hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try are as far from doing full ju&s;tice to their cau&s;e in this war, as Walpole was from doing ju&s;tice to the peace which at that time he was willing to pre&s;erve. They throw the light on one fide only of their ca&s;e; though it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not ob&s;erve, that the other fide which is kept in the &s;hade, has it's importance too. They mu&s;t know, that France is formidable, not only as &s;he is France, but as &s;he is Jacobin France. They knew from the beginning that the Jacobin party was not confined to that country. They knew, they felt&punc; the &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ame faction in both countries to communicate and to co|operate. For &s;ome time pa&s;t, the&s;e two points
<PB N="75" REF="76">
have been kept, and even indu&s;triou&s;ly kept, out of &s;ight. France is con&s;idered as merely a foreign Power; and the &s;editious Engli&s;h only as a dome&s;|tick faction. The merits of the war with the for|mer have been argued &s;olely on political grounds. To prevent the mi&s;chievous doctrines of the latter, from corrupting our minds, matter and argument have been &s;upplied abundantly, and even to &s;ur|feit, on the excellency of our own government. But nothing has been done to make us feel in what manner the &s;afety of that Government is connected with the principle and with the i&s;&s;ue of this war. For any thing, which in the late di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion has appeared, the war is entirely collateral to the &s;tate of Jacobini&s;m; as truly a foreign war to us and to all our home concerns, as the war with Spain in 1739, about <HI>Garda-Co&s;tas,</HI> the Madrid Convention, and the fable of Captain <HI>Jenkins's</HI> ears.</P>
<P>Whenever the adver&s;e party has rai&s;ed a cry for peace with the Regicide, the an&s;wer has been little more than this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Admini&s;tration wi&s;hed for &s;uch a peace, full as much as the Oppo&s;ition; but that the time was not convenient for making it."</Q> Whatever el&s;e has been &s;aid was much in the &s;ame &s;pirit. Rea&s;ons of this kind never touched the &s;ub|&s;tantial merits of the war. They were in the na|ture of dilatory pleas, exceptions of form, pre|vious
<PB N="76" REF="77">
que&s;tions. Accordingly all the arguments again&s;t a compliance with what was repre&s;ented as the popular de&s;ire, (urged on with all po&s;&s;i|ble vehemence and earne&s;tne&s;s by the Jacobins) have appeared flat and languid, feeble and eva|&s;ive. They appeared to aim only at gaining time. They never entered into the peculiar and di&s;tinctive character of the war. They &s;poke neither to the under&s;tanding nor to the heart. Cold as ice them&s;elves, they never could kindle in our brea&s;ts a &s;park of that zeal, which is nece&s;&s;ary to a conflict with an adver&s;e zeal; much le&s;s were they made to infu&s;e into our minds, that &s;tubborn per&s;evering &s;pirit, which alone is capable of bearing up again&s;t tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, which will probably occur, and tho&s;e burthens which mu&s;t be inevitably borne in a long war. I &s;peak it empha|tically, and with a de&s;ire that it &s;hould be marked, in a <HI>long</HI> war; becau&s;e, without &s;uch a war, no ex|perience has yet told us, that a dangerous power has ever been reduced to mea&s;ure or to rea&s;on. I do not throw back my view to the Peloponne&s;ian war of twenty-&s;even years; nor to two of the Pu|nick wars, the fir&s;t of twenty-four, the &s;econd of eighteen; nor to the more recent war concluded by the treaty of We&s;tphalia, which continued, I think, for thirty. I go to what is but ju&s;t fallen behind living memory, and immediately touches our own country. Let the portion of our hi&s;tory
<PB N="77" REF="78">
from the year 1689 to 1713 be brought before us, We &s;hall find, that in all that period of twenty-four years, there were hardly five that could be called a &s;ea&s;on of peace; and the interval between the two wars was in reality, nothing more than a very ac|tive preparation for renovated ho&s;tility. During that period, every one of the propo&s;itions of peace came from the enemy: The fir&s;t, when they were ac|cepted, at the peace of Ry&s;wick; The &s;econd, where they were rejected at the congre&s;s at Ger|truydenburgh; The la&s;t, when the war ended by the treaty of Utrecht. Even then, a very great part of the nation, and that which contained by far the mo&s;t intelligent &s;tate&s;men, was again&s;t the conclu&s;ion of the war. I do not enter into the merits of that que&s;tion as between the parties. I only &s;tate the exi&s;tence of that opinion as a fact, from whence you may draw &s;uch an inference as you think properly ari&s;es from it.</P>
<P>It is for us at pre&s;ent to recollect what we have been; and to con&s;ider what, if we plea&s;e, we may be &s;till. At the period of tho&s;e wars, our principal &s;trength was found in the re&s;olution of the people; that in the re&s;olution of a part only and of the then whole, which bore no proportion to our exi&s;ting magnitude. England and Scotland were not united at the beginning of that mighty &s;truggle. When, in the cour&s;e of the conte&s;t,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
they were conjoined, it was in a raw, an ill-ce|mented, an unproductive union. For the whole duration of the war, and long after, the names, and other outward and vi&s;ible &s;igns of approximation, rather augmented than dimini&s;hed our in&s;ular feuds. They were rather the cau&s;es of new di&s;con|tents and new troubles, than promoters of cordia|lity and affection. The now &s;ingle and potent Great Britain was then not only two countries, but, from the party heats in both, and the divi|&s;ions formed in each of them, each of the old king|doms within it&s;elf in effect was made up of two ho&s;tile nations. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eland, now &s;o large a &s;ource of the common opulence and power, which wi&s;ely managed might be made much more beneficial and much more effective, was then the heavie&s;t of the burthens. An army not much le&s;s than forty thou&s;and men, was drawn from the general effort, to keep that kingdom in a poor, unfruitful, and re|&s;ourcele&s;s &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of the empire. The &s;tate of our finances was wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible. Every branch of the revenue became le&s;s productive after the Revolution. Silver, not as now a &s;ort of coun|ter, but the body of the current coin, was reduced &s;o low, as not to have above three parts in four of the value in the &s;hilling. It required a dead ex|pence of three millions &s;terling to renew the coin
<PB N="79" REF="80">
age. Publick credit, that great but ambiguous principle, which has &s;o often been predicted as the cau&s;e of our certain ruin, but which for a century has been the con&s;tant companion, and often the means, of our pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s, had it's ori|gin, and was cradled, I may &s;ay, in bankruptcy and beggary. At this day we have &s;een parties contending to be admitted, at a moderate premi|um, to advance eighteen millions to the Exchequer. For infinitely &s;maller loans, the Chancellor of the Exchequer of that day, Montagu, the father of publick credit, counter-&s;ecuring the State by the appearance of the city, with the Lord-Mayor of London at his &s;ide, was obliged, like an agent at an election, to go cap in hand from &s;hop to &s;hop, to borrow an hundred pound and even &s;maller &s;ums. When made up in driblets as they could, their be&s;t &s;ecurities were at an intere&s;t of 12 per cent. Even the paper of the Bank (now at par with ca&s;h, and even &s;ometimes preferred to it) was often at a di&s;count of twenty per cent. By this the &s;tate of the re&s;t may be judged.</P>
<P>As to our commerce, the imports and exports of the nation, now &s;ix and forty million, did not then amount to ten. The inland trade, which is com|monly pa&s;&s;ed by in this &s;ort of e&s;timates, but which, in part growing out of the foreign, and connected with it, is more advantageous, and more &s;ub&s;tan|tially
<PB N="80" REF="81">
nutritive to the State, is not only grown in a proportion of near five to one as the foreign, but has been augmented, at lea&s;t, in a tenfold pro|portion. When I came to England, I remem|ber but one river navigation, the rate of car|riage on which was limited by an Act of Parlia|ment. It was made in the reign of William the Third; I mean that of the Aire and Calder. The rate was &s;ettled at thirteen pence. So high a price demon&s;trated the feeblene&s;s of the&s;e beginnings of our inland intercou&s;e. In my time, one of the longe&s;t and &s;harpe&s;t conte&s;ts I remember in your Hou&s;e, and which rather re&s;embled a violent con|tention among&s;t national parties than a local di&s;|pute, was, as well as I can recollect, to hold the price up to threepence. Even this, which a very &s;canty ju&s;tice to the proprietors required, was done with infinite difficulty. As to private credit, there were not, as I be&s;t remember, twelve Bankers &s;hops at that time out of London. In this their number, when I fir&s;t faw the country, I cannot be quite ex|act; but certainly tho&s;e machines of dome&s;tick credit were then very few indeed. They are now in almo&s;t every market town: and this cir|cum&s;tance (whether the thing be carried to an ex|ce&s;s or not) demon&s;trates the a&s;toni&s;hing en|crea&s;e of private confidence, of general circula|tion, and of internal commerce; an encrea&s;e out of all proportion to the growth of the foreign trade.

Our naval &s;trength in the time of King William's war was nearly matched by that of France; and though conjoined with Holland, then a maritime Power hardly inferior to our own, even with that force we were not always victorious. Though finally &s;uperior, the allied fleets experienced many unplea&s;ant rever&s;es on their own element. In two years three thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els were taken from the Engli&s;h trade.

<P><PB N="83" REF="84">While that fir&s;t war (which was ill &s;mothered by the treaty of Ry&s;wick) &s;lept in the thin a&s;hes of a &s;eeming peace, a new conflagration was in it's im|mediate cau&s;es. A fre&s;h and a far greater war was in preparation. A year had hardly elap&s;ed when arrangements were made for renewing the conte&s;t with tenfold fury. The &s;teps which were taken, at that time, to compo&s;e, to reconcile, to unite, and to di&s;cipline all Europe again&s;t the growth of France, certainly furni&s;h to a &s;tate&s;man the fine&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting part in the hi&s;tory of that great period.

Full of the idea of pre&s;erving, not only a local civil li|berty united with order, to our country, but to embody it in the political liberty, the order, and the independence of nations united under a natu|ral head, the King called upon his Parliament to put it&s;elf into a po&s;ture <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>to pre&s;erve to England the weight and influence it at pre&s;ent had on the coun|cils and affairs</HI> ABROAD.

repul&s;ed, over and over again he returned to the charge. All the mortifications he had &s;uffered from the la&s;t Parliament, and the greater he had to apprehend from that newly cho&s;en, were not ca|pable of relaxing the vigour of his mind. He was in Holland when he combined the va&s;t plan of his foreign negociations. When he came to open his de&s;ign to his Mini&s;ters in England, even the &s;ober firmne&s;s of Somers, the undaunted re&s;olu|tion of Shrew&s;bury, and the adventurous &s;pirit of Montagu and Orford, were &s;taggered. They were not yet mounted to the elevation of the King. The Cabinet met on the &s;ubject at Tun|bridge Wells the 28th of Augu&s;t, 1698; and there, Lord Somers holding the pen, after expre&s;|&s;ing doubts on the &s;tate of the continent, which they ultimately refer to the King, as be&s;t inform|ed, they give him a mo&s;t di&s;couraging portrait of the &s;pirit of this nation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So far as relates to England," &s;ay the&s;e Mini&s;ters, "it would be want of duty not to give your Maje&s;ty this clear account, that <HI>there</HI> is a <HI>deadne&s;s and want of &s;pi|rit in the nation univer&s;ally,</HI> &s;o as not to be at all di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>entering into a new war.</HI> That they &s;eem to be <HI>tired out with taxes</HI> to a degree beyond what was di&s;cerned, till it appeared upon occa&s;ion of the <HI>late elections.</HI> This is the truth of the fact upon which your Maje&s;ty will deter|mine what re&s;olution ought to be taken."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">His Maje&s;ty did determine; and did take and pur&s;ue his re&s;olution.

<P>It required &s;ome time to accompli&s;h this work. The people were fir&s;t gained, and through them their di&s;tracted repre&s;entatives. Under the influence of King William Holland had re&s;i&s;ted the allurements of every &s;eduction, and had re&s;i&s;ted the terrors of every menace. With Hannibal at her gates, &s;he had nobly and magnanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed all &s;eparate treaty, or any thing which might for a moment appear to divide her affection or her intere&s;t, or even to di&s;tingui&s;h her in identity from England.

Having &s;ettled the great point of the con&s;olida|tion (which he hoped would be eternal) of the countries made for a common intere&s;t, and com|mon &s;entiment, the King, in his me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es, calls their attention to the affairs of the <HI>States General.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Lords was perfectly &s;ound, and entirely impre&s;&s;ed with the wi&s;dom and dignity of the King's proceedings.

<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons was more re&s;erved; the late popular di&s;po&s;ition was &s;till in a great degree prevalent in the repre&s;entative, after it had been made to change in the con&s;tituent body. The principle of the Grand Alliance was not directly recognized in the re&s;olution of the Commons, nor the war announced, though they were well aware the alliance was formed for the war. However, compelled by the returning &s;en&s;e of the people, they went &s;o far as to fix the three great immove|able pillars of the &s;afety and greatne&s;s of England,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
as they were then, as they are now, and as they mu&s;t ever be to the end of time. They a&s;&s;erted in general terms the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting Holland; of keeping united with our allies; and maintain|ing the liberty of Europe; though they re&s;tricted their vote to the &s;uccours &s;tipulated by actual treaty. But now they were fairly embarked; they were obliged to go with the cour&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el; and the whole nation, &s;plit before into an hundred adver&s;e factions, with a King at it's head evidently declining to his tomb, the whole nation, Lords, Commons, and People, proceeded as one body, informed by one &s;oul. Under the Briti&s;h union, the union of Europe was con&s;olidated; and it long held together with a degree of cohe&s;ion, firmne&s;s, and fidelity not known before or &s;ince in any po|litical combination of that extent.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the la&s;t hand was given to this immen&s;e and complicated machine, the ma&s;ter workman died: But the work was formed on true mecha|nical principles; and it was as truly wrought. It went by the impul&s;e it had received from the fir&s;t mover. The man was dead: But the grand alliance &s;urvived, in which King William lived and reigned. That heartle&s;s and di&s;pirited people, whom Lord Somers had repre&s;ented, about two years before, as dead in energy and operation&punc; continued that war to which it was &s;uppo&s;ed they
<PB N="89" REF="90">
were unequal in mind, and in means, for near thirteen years.</P>
<P>For what have I entered into all this detail? To what purpo&s;e have I recalled your view to the end of the la&s;t century? It has been done to &s;hew that the Briti&s;h Nation was then a great people&mdash; to point out how and by what means they came to be exalted above the vulgar level, and to take that lead which they a&s;&s;umed among mankind. To qualify us for that pre-eminence, we had then an high mind, and a con&s;tancy unconquerable; we were then in&s;pired with no fla&s;hy pa&s;&s;ions; but &s;uch as were durable as well as warm; &s;uch as cor|re&s;ponded to the great intere&s;ts we had at &s;take. This force of character was in&s;pired, as all &s;uch &s;pi|rit mu&s;t ever be, from above. Government gave the impul&s;e. As well may we fancy, that, of it&s;elf the &s;ea will &s;well, and that without winds the billows will in&s;ult the adver&s;e &s;hore, as that the gro&s;s ma&s;s of the people will be moved, and elevated, and continue by a &s;teady and permanent direc|tion to bear upon one point, without the influence of &s;uperior authority, or &s;uperior mind.</P>
<P>This impul&s;e ought, in my opinion, to have been given in this war; and it ought to have been con|tinued to it at every in&s;tant. It is made, if ever war was made, to touch all the great &s;prings of
<PB N="90" REF="91">
action in the human brea&s;t. It ought not to have been a war of apology. The Mini&s;ter had, in this conflict, wherewithal to glory in &s;ucce&s;s; to be con&s;oled in adver&s;ity; to hold high his principle in all fortunes. If it were not given him to &s;up|port the falling edifice, he ought to bury him&s;elf under the ruins of the civilized world. All the art of Greece, and all the pride and power of ea&s;|tern Monarchs, never heaped upon their a&s;hes &s;o grand a monument.</P>
<P>There were days when his great mind was up to the cri&s;is of the world he is called to act in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Declaration.</NOTE>. His manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wi&s;dom of &s;uch &s;entiments. But the little have triumphed over the great; an unnatural, (as it &s;hould &s;eem) not an unu&s;ual victory. I am &s;ure you cannot forget with how much unea&s;ine&s;s we heard in conver&s;ation, the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this conte&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was willing to try the war for a year or two, and if it did not &s;ucceed, then to vote for peace."</Q> As if war was a matter of experiment! As if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolick! As if the dire godde&s;s that pre&s;ides over it, with her mur|derous &s;pear in her hand, and her gorgon at her brea&s;t, was a coquette to be flirted with! We ought with reverence to approach that tremendous

It is never to be entered into without a mature deliberation; not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indeci&s;ion, but a deliberation leading to a &s;ure and fixed judgment. When &s;o taken up it is not to be abandoned without rea&s;on as valid, as fully, and as exten&s;ively con&s;idered. Peace may be made as unadvi&s;edly as war. No|thing is &s;o ra&s;h as fear; and the coun&s;els of pu&s;il|lanimity very rarely put off, whil&s;t they are always &s;ure to aggravate, the evils from which they would fly.</P>
<P>In that great war carried on again&s;t Louis the XIVth for near eighteen years, Government &s;pared no pains to &s;atisfy the nation, that though they were to be animated by a de&s;ire of glory, glory was not their ultimate object: but that every thing dear to them, in religion, in law, in liberty, every thing which as freemen, as Engli&s;hmen, and as ci|tizens of the great commonwealth of Chri&s;tendom, they had at heart, was then at &s;take. This was to know the true art of gaining the affections and confidence of an high-minded people; this was to under&s;tand human nature. A danger to avert a danger&mdash;a pre&s;ent inconvenience and &s;uffer|ing to prevent a fore&s;een future, and a wor&s;e calamity&mdash;the&s;e are the motives that belong to
<PB N="92" REF="93">
an animal, who, in his con&s;titution, is at once ad|venturous and provident; circum&s;pect and daring; whom his Creator has made, as the Poet &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of large di&s;cour&s;e, looking before and after."</Q> But never can a vehement and &s;u&s;tained &s;pirit of forti|tude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation. It has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gu&s;ts of adver&s;ity. Even where men are wil|ling, as &s;ometimes they are, to barter their blood for lucre, to hazard their &s;afety for the gratification of their avarice, the pa&s;&s;ion, which animates them to that &s;ort of conflict, like all the &s;hort-&s;ighted pa&s;|&s;ions, mu&s;t &s;ee it's objects di&s;tinct and near at hand. The pa&s;&s;ions of the lower order are hungry and im|patient. Speculative plunder; contingent &s;poil; fu|ture, long adjourned, uncertain booty; pillage which mu&s;t enrich a late po&s;terity, and which po&s;&s;ibly may not reach to po&s;terity at all; the&s;e, for any length of time, will never &s;upport a mercenary war. The people are in the right. The calculation of profit in all &s;uch wars is fal&s;e. On balancing the ac|count of &s;uch wars, ten thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar are purcha&s;ed at ten thou&s;and times their price. The blood of man &s;hould never be &s;hed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well &s;hed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The re&s;t is vanity; the re&s;t is crime.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">In the war of the Grand Alliance, mo&s;t of the&s;e con&s;iderations voluntarily and naturally had their part. Some were pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice.

<P>If a war to prevent Louis the XIVth from im|po&s;ing his religion was ju&s;t, a war to prevent the murderers of Louis the XVIth from impo&s;ing their irreligion upon us is ju&s;t; a war to prevent the ope|ration of a &s;y&s;tem, which makes life without digni|ty, and death without hope, is a ju&s;t war.</P>

<P>You, who have looked at this matter with as fair and impartial an eye as can be united with a feel|ing heart, you will not think it an hardy a&s;&s;ertion, when I affirm, that it were far better to be con|quered by any other nation, than to have this fac|tion for a neighbour. Before I felt my&s;elf autho|ri&s;ed to &s;ay this, I con&s;idered the &s;tate of all the countries in Europe for the&s;e la&s;t three hundred years, which have been obliged to &s;ubmit to a fo|reign law. In mo&s;t of tho&s;e I found the condition of the annexed countries even better, certainly not wor&s;e, than the lot of tho&s;e which were the patrimony of the conquerour. They wanted &s;ome ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;but they were free from many very great evils. They were rich and tranquil. Such was Artois, Flanders, Lorrain, Al&s;atia, un|der the old Government of France. Such was Sile&s;ia under the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. They who are to live in the vicinity of this new fabrick, are to pre|pare to live in perpetual con&s;piracies and &s;editions; and to end at la&s;t, in being conquered, if not to her dominion, to her re&s;emblance. But when we talk of conque&s;t by other nations, it is only to put a ca&s;e. This is the only power in Europe by which
<PB N="95" REF="96">
it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> we &s;hould be conquered. To live under the continual dread of &s;uch immea&s;urable evils is it&s;elf a grievous calamity. To live without the dread of them is to turn the danger into the di&s;a&s;ter. The influence of &s;uch a France is equal to a war; it's example, more wa&s;ting than an ho&s;|tile irruption. The ho&s;tility with any other power is &s;eparable and accidental; this power, by the very condition of it's exi&s;tence, by it's very e&s;&s;ential con&s;titution, is in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with us, and with all civilized people.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See declaration, Whitehall, October 29, 1793.</NOTE></P>
<P>A Government of the nature of that &s;et up at our very door has never been hitherto &s;een, or even imagined, in Europe. What our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations. It is a &s;erious thing to have a connexion with a people, who live only under po&s;itive, arbitrary, and change|able in&s;titutions; and tho&s;e not perfected nor &s;up|plied, nor explained, by any common acknowledged rule of moral &s;cience. I remember that in one of my la&s;t conver&s;ations with the late Lord Camden, we were &s;truck much in the &s;ame manner with the abolition in France of the law, as a &s;cience of methodized and artificial equity. France, &s;ince her Revolution, is under the &s;way of a &s;ect, who&s;e leaders have deliberately, at one &s;troke, de|moli&s;hed the whole body of that juri&s;prudence which France had pretty nearly in common with
<PB N="96" REF="97">
other civilized countries. In that juri&s;prudence were contained the elements and principles of the law of nations, the great ligament of mankind. With the law they have of cour&s;e de&s;troyed all &s;eminaries in which juri&s;prudence was taught, as well as all the corporations e&s;tabli&s;hed for it's con|&s;ervation. I have not heard of any country, whe|ther in Europe or A&s;ia, or even in Africa on this &s;ide of Mount Atlas, which is wholly without &s;ome &s;uch colleges and &s;uch corporations, except France. No man, in a publick or private concern, can di|vine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed; nor is there to be found a profe&s;&s;or in any Univer&s;ity, or a practitioner in any Court, who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in France, in any ca&s;e whatever. They have not only annulled all their old treaties; but they have renounced the law of nations from whence treaties have their force. With a fixed de&s;ign they have outlawed them&s;elves, and to their power outlawed all other nations.</P>

<P>When to the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments of Regicide, of Jacobini&s;m, and of Athei&s;m, you add the <HI>corre|&s;pondent &s;y&s;tem of manners,</HI> no doubt can be left on the mind of a thinking man, concerning their determined ho&s;tility to the human race. Manners are of more importance than laws. Upon them, in a great mea&s;ure the laws depend. The law touches us but here and there, and now and then. Manners are what vex or &s;ooth, corrupt or purify, exalt or de|ba&s;e, barbarize or refine us, by a con&s;tant, &s;teady,

uniform, in&s;en&s;ible operation, like that of the air we breathe in. They give their whole form and colour to our lives. According to their quality, they aid morals, they &s;upply them, or they totally de&s;troy them. Of this the new French Legi&s;lators were aware; therefore, with the &s;ame method, and under the &s;ame authority, they &s;ettled a &s;y&s;tem of manners, the mo&s;t licentious, pro&s;titute, and abandoned that ever has been known, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t coar&s;e, rude, &s;avage, and fe|rocious. Nothing in the Revolution, no, not to a phra&s;e or a ge&s;ture, not to the fa&s;hion of a hat or a &s;hoe, was left to accident. All has been the re&s;ult of de&s;ign; all has been matter of in&s;ti|tution. No mechanical means could be devi&s;ed in favour of this incredible &s;y&s;tem of wickedne&s;s and vice, that has not been employed. The noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, the love of glory, the love of country, have bee debauched into means of it's pre&s;ervation and it's propagation. All &s;orts of &s;hews and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination, and pervert the moral &s;en&s;e, have been con|trived. They have &s;ometimes brought forth five or &s;ix hundred drunken women, calling at the bar of the A&s;&s;embly for the blood of their own children, as being royali&s;ts or con&s;titutionali&s;ts. Sometimes they have got a body of wretches, calling them&s;elves fathers, to demand the murder of their &s;ons: boa&s;ting that Rome had but one Brutus, but that they could &s;hew five hundred.

There were in&s;tances, in which they inverted, and retaliated the impiety, and produced &s;ons, who cal|led for the execution of their parents. The foun|dation of their Republick is laid in moral para|doxes. Their patrioti&s;m is always prodigy. All tho&s;e in&s;tances to be found in hi&s;tory, whether real or fabulous, of a doubtful publick &s;pirit, at which morality is perplexed, rea&s;on is &s;taggered, and from which affrighted nature recoils, are their cho&s;en, and almo&s;t &s;ole examples for the in&s;truction of their youth.</P>
<P>The whole drift of their in&s;titution is contrary to that of the wi&s;e Legi&s;lators of all countries, who aimed at improving in&s;tincts into morals, and at grafting the virtues on the &s;tock of the natural affections. They, on the contrary, have omitted no pains to eradicate every benevolent and noble pro|pen&s;ity in the mind of men. In their culture it is a rule always to graft virtues on vices. They think every thing unworthy of the name of publick virtue, un|le&s;s it indicates violence on the private. All their new in&s;titutions, (and with them every thing is new) &s;trike at the root of our &s;ocial nature. Other Legi&s;lators, knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations, and con&s;equently the fir&s;t element of all duties, have endeavoured, by every art, to make it &s;acred. The Chri&s;tian Religion, by confining it to the pairs, and by rendering that relation indi&s;&s;o|luble,
<PB N="102" REF="103">
has, by the&s;e two things, done more towards the peace, happine&s;s, &s;ettlement, and civilization of the world, than by any other part in this whole &s;cheme of Divine Wi&s;dom. The direct contrary cour&s;e has been taken in the Synagogue of Anti|chri&s;t, I mean in that forge and manufactory of all evil, the &s;ect which predominated in the Con&s;ti|tuent A&s;&s;embly of 1789. Tho&s;e mon&s;ters em|ployed the &s;ame, or greater indu&s;try, to de&s;ecrate and degrade that State, which other Legi&s;lators have u&s;ed to render it holy and honourable. By a &s;trange, uncalled for declaration, they pronounced, that marriage was no better than a common, civil contract. It was one of their ordinary tricks, to put their &s;entiments into the mouths of certain per&s;onated characters, which they theatrically ex|hibited at the bar of what ought to be a &s;erious A&s;&s;embly. One of the&s;e was brought out in the figure of a pro&s;titute, whom they called by the affected name of <Q REND="inline">"a mother without being a wife."</Q>This creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities, which in civilized States are put upon ba&s;tards. The pro&s;titutes of the A&s;|&s;embly gave to this their puppet the &s;anction of their greater impudence. In con&s;equence of the principles laid down, and the manners authori&s;ed, ba&s;tards were not long after put on the footing of the i&s;&s;ue of lawful unions. Proceeding in the &s;pirit of the fir&s;t authors of their con&s;titution, &s;uccceding a&s;|&s;emblies

went the full length of the principle, and gave a licence to divorce at the mere plea&s;ure of either party, and at a month's notice. With them the matrimonial connexion is brought into &s;o de|graded a &s;tate of concubinage, that, I believe, none of the wretches in London, who keep warehou&s;es of infamy, would give out one of their victims to private cu&s;tody on &s;o &s;hort and in&s;olent a tenure. There was indeed a kind of profligate equity in thus giving to women the &s;ame licentious power. The rea&s;on they a&s;&s;igned was as infamous as the act; declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of hu&s;bands. It is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve upon the horrible con&s;equences of taking one half of the &s;pecies wholly out of the guardian&s;hip and protection of the other.</P>
<P>The practice of divorce, though in &s;ome coun|tries permitted, has been di&s;couraged in all. In the Ea&s;t, polygamy and divorce are in di&s;credit; and the manners correct the laws. In Rome, whil&s;t Rome was in it's integrity, the few cau&s;es al|lowed for divorce amounted in effect to a prohi|bition. They were only three. The arbitrary was totally excluded; and accordingly &s;ome hundreds of years pa&s;&s;ed, without a &s;ingle example of that kind. When manners were corrupted, the laws were relaxed; as the latter always follow the former, when they are not able to regulate them,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
or to vanqui&s;h them. Of this circum&s;tance the Le|gi&s;lators of vice and crime were plea&s;ed to take notice, as an inducement to adopt their regulation; holding out an hope, that the permi&s;&s;ion would as rarely be made u&s;e of. They knew the contrary to be true; and they had taken good care, that the laws &s;hould be well &s;econded by the manners. Their law of divorce, like all their laws, had not for it's object the relief of dome&s;tick unea&s;ine&s;s, but the total corruption of all morals, the total di&s;connection of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>It is a matter of curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve the operation of this encouragement to di&s;order. I have before me the Paris paper, corre&s;pondent to the u&s;ual regi&s;ter of births, marriages, and deaths. Divorce, hap|pily, is no regular head of regi&s;try among&s;t civi|lized nations. With the Jacobins it is remarkable, that divorce is not only a regular head, but it has the po&s;t of honour. It occupies the fir&s;t place in the li&s;t. In the three fir&s;t months of the year 1793, the number of divorces in that city amounted to 562. The marriages were 1785; &s;o that the propor|tion of divorces to marriages was not much le&s;s than one to three; a thing unexampled, I believe, among mankind. I cau&s;ed an enquiry to be made at Doctor's Commons, concerning the num|ber of divorces; and found, that all the divorces (which, except by &s;pecial Act of Parliament, are
<PB N="105" REF="106">
&s;eparations, and not proper divorces) did not amount in all tho&s;e Courts, and in an hundred years, to much more than one fifth of tho&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed, in the &s;ingle city of Paris, in three months. I followed up the enquiry relative to that city through &s;everal of the &s;ub&s;equent months until I was tired, and found the proportions &s;till the &s;ame. Since then I have heard that they have declared for a revi&s;al of the&s;e laws: but I know of nothing done. It ap|pears as if the contract that renovates the world was under no law at all. From this we may take our e&s;timate of the havock that has been made through all the relations of life. With the Ja|cobins of France, vague intercour&s;e is without reproach; marriage is reduced to the vile&s;t con|cubinage; children are encouraged to cut the throats of their parents; mothers are taught that tenderne&s;s is no part of their character; and to demonstrate their attachment to their party, that they ought to make no &s;cruple to rake with their bloody hands in the bowels of tho&s;e who came from their own.</P>
<P>To all this let us join the practice of <HI>canniba|li&s;m,</HI> with which, in the proper terms, and with the greate&s;t truth, their &s;everal factions accu&s;e each other. By cannibali&s;m, I mean their devour|ing, as a nutriment of their ferocity, &s;ome part of the bodies of tho&s;e they have murdered; their
<PB N="106" REF="107">
drinking the blood of their victims, and forcing the victims them&s;elves to drink the blood of their kindred &s;laughtered before their faces. By canni|bali&s;m, I mean al&s;o to &s;ignify all their namele&s;s, un|manly, and abominable in&s;ults on the bodies of tho&s;e they &s;laughter.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e whom they &s;uffer to die a natural death, they do not permit them to enjoy the la&s;t con|&s;olations of mankind, or tho&s;e rights of &s;epulture, which indicate hope, and which meer nature has taught to mankind in all countries, to &s;oothe the afflictions, and to cover the infirmity of mortal condition. They di&s;grace men in the entry into life; they vitiate and en&s;lave them through the whole cour&s;e of it; and they deprive them of all comfort at the conclu&s;ion of their di&s;honoured and depraved exi&s;tence. Endeavouring to per&s;uade the people that they are no better than bea&s;ts, the whole body of their in&s;titution tends to make them bea&s;ts of prey, furious and &s;avage. For this purpo&s;e the active part of them is di&s;ciplined into a ferocity which has no parallel. To this ferocity there is joined not one of the rude, unfa&s;hioned virtues, which accompany the vices, where the whole are left to grow up together in the rankne&s;s of uncultivated nature. But nothing is left to na|ture in their &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">The &s;ame di&s;cipline which hardens their hearts relaxes their morals. Whil&s;t courts of ju&s;tice were thru&s;t out by revolutionary tribunals, and &s;ilent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion, there were no fewer than nineteen or twenty theatres, great and &s;mall, mo&s;t of them kept open at the publick expence, and all of them crowded every night. Among the gaunt, hagard forms of famine and nakedne&s;s, amid&s;t the yells of murder, the tears of affliction, and the cries of de&s;pair, the &s;ong, the dance, the mimick &s;cene, the buffoon laughter, went on as regularly as in the gay hour of fe&s;tive peace. I have it from good authority, that under the &s;caffold of judicial murder, and the gaping planks that poured down blood on the &s;pectators, the &s;pace was hired out for a &s;hew of dancing dogs. I think, without concert, we have made the very &s;ame remark on reading &s;ome of their pieces, which being written for other purpo&s;es, let us into a view of their &s;ocial life. It &s;truck us that the habits of Paris had no re&s;em|blance to the fini&s;hed virtues, or to the poli&s;hed vice, and elegant, though not blamele&s;s luxury, of the capital of a great empire. Their &s;ociety was more like that of a den of outlaws upon a doubt|ful frontier; of a lewd tavern for the revels and debauches of banditti, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, bravos, &s;mugglers, and their more de&s;perate paramours, mixed with bomba&s;tick players, the refu&s;e and rejected offal of &s;trolling theatres, puffing out ill-&s;orted ver&s;es
<PB N="108" REF="109">
about virtue, mixed with the licentious and bla&s;|phemous &s;ongs, proper to the brutal and hardened cour&s;e of life belonging to that &s;ort of wretehes. This &s;y&s;tem of manners in it&s;elf is at war with all orderly and moral &s;ociety, and is in it's neighbour|hood un&s;afe. If great bodies of that kind were any where e&s;tabli&s;hed in a bordering territory, we &s;hould have a right to demand of their Govern|ments the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a nui&s;ance. What are we to do if the Government and the whole community is of the &s;ame de&s;cription? Yet that Government has thought proper to invite ours to lay by its unju&s;t hatred, and to li&s;ten to the voice of humanity as taught by their example.</P>
<P>The operation of dangerous and delu&s;ive fir&s;t principles obliges us to have recour&s;e to the true ones. In the intercour&s;e between nations, we are apt to rely too much on the in&s;trumental part. We lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts. We do not act much more wi&s;ely when we tru&s;t to the intere&s;ts of men as guarantees of their engagements. The intere&s;ts frequently tear to pieces the engagements; and the pa&s;&s;ions trample upon both. Entirely to tru&s;t to either, is to di&s;regard our own &s;afety, or not to know mankind. Men are not tied to one an|other by papers and &s;eals. They are led to a&s;&s;o|ciate by re&s;emblances, by conformities, by &s;ym|pathies. It is with nations as with individuals.
<PB N="109" REF="110">
Nothing is &s;o &s;trong a tie of amity between na|tion and nation as corre&s;pondence in laws, cu&s;toms, manners, and habits of life. They have more than the force of treaties in them&s;elves. They are obli|gations written in the heart. They approximate men to men, without their knowledge, and &s;ome|times again&s;t their intentions. The &s;ecret, un&s;een, but irrefragable bond of habitual intercour&s;e, holds them together, even when their perver&s;e and liti|gious nature &s;ets them to equivocate, &s;cuffle, and fight about the terms of their written obligations.</P>
<P>As to war, if it be the means of wrong and vio|lence, it is the &s;ole means of ju&s;tice among&s;t nations. Nothing can bani&s;h it from the world. They who &s;ay otherwi&s;e, intending to impo&s;e upon us, do not impo&s;e upon them&s;elves. But it is one of the greate&s;t objects of human wi&s;dom to mitigate tho&s;e evils which we are unable to remove. The confor|mity and analogy of which I &s;peak, incapable, like every thing el&s;e, of pre&s;erving perfect tru&s;t and tranquillity among men, has a &s;trong tendency to facilitate accommodation, and to produce a ge|nerous oblivion of the rancour of their quarrels. With this &s;imilitude, peace is more of peace, and war is le&s;s of war. I will go further. There have been periods of time in which communities, appa|rently in peace with each other, have been more perfectly &s;eparated than, in later times, many na|tions
<PB N="110" REF="111">
in Europe have been in the cour&s;e of long and bloody wars. The cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;ought in the &s;imilitude throughout Europe of religion, laws, and manners. At bottom, the&s;e are all the &s;ame. The writers on public law have often called this <HI>aggre|gate</HI> of nations a Commonwealth. They had rea|&s;on. It is virtually one great &s;tate having the &s;ame ba&s;is of general law; with &s;ome diver&s;ity of pro|vincial cu&s;toms and local e&s;tabli&s;hments. The na|tions of Europe have had the very &s;ame chri&s;tian religion, agreeing in the fundamental parts, vary|ing a little in the ceremonies and in the &s;ubordi|nate doctrines. The whole of the polity and oeconomy of every country in Europe has been derived from the &s;ame &s;ources. It was drawn from the old Germanic or Gothic cu&s;tumary; from the feudal in&s;titutions which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an emanation from that cu&s;tumary; and the whole has been improved and dige&s;ted into &s;y&s;tem and di&s;|cipline by the Roman law. From hence aro&s;e the &s;everal orders, with or without a Monarch, (which are called States) in every European coun|try; the &s;trong traces of which, where Monarchy predominated, were never wholly extingui&s;hed or merged in de&s;poti&s;m. In the few places where Monarchy was ca&s;t off, the &s;pirit of European Monarchy was &s;till left. Tho&s;e countries &s;till con|tinued countries of States; that is, of cla&s;&s;es, orders, and di&s;tinctions, &s;uch as had before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, or
<PB N="111" REF="112">
nearly &s;o. Indeed the force and form of the in&s;ti|tution called States, continued in greater perfection in tho&s;e republican communities than under Mo|narchies. From all tho&s;e &s;cources aro&s;e a &s;y&s;tem of manners and of education which was nearly &s;imilar in all this quarter of the globe; and which &s;oftened, blended, and harmonized the colours of the whole. There was little difference in the form of the Univer&s;ities for the education of their youth, whe|ther with regard to faculties, to &s;ciences, or to the more liberal and elegant kinds of erudition. From this re&s;emblance in the modes of intercour&s;e, and in the whole form and fa&s;hion of life, no citizen of Eu|rope could be altogether an exile in any part of it. There was nothing more than a plea&s;ing variety to recreate and in&s;truct the mind; to enrich the ima|gination; and to meliorate the heart. When a man travelled or re&s;ided for health, plea&s;ure, bu&s;ine&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity, from his own country, he never felt him&s;elf quite abroad.</P>
<P>The whole body of this new &s;cheme of manners in &s;upport of the new &s;cheme of politicks, I con|&s;ider as a &s;trong and deci&s;ive proof of determined ambition and &s;y&s;tematick ho&s;tility. I defy the mo&s;t refining ingenuity to invent any other cau&s;e for the total departure of the Jacobin Republick from every one of the ideas and u&s;ages, religious,
<PB N="112" REF="113">
legal, moral, or &s;ocial, of this civilized world, and for her tearing her&s;elf from its communion with &s;uch &s;tudied violence, but from a formed re&s;olution of keeping no terms with that world. It has not been, as has been fal&s;ely and in&s;idiou&s;ly repre&s;ented, that the&s;e mi&s;creants had only broke with their old Go|vernment. They made a &s;chi&s;m with the whole univer&s;e; and that &s;chi&s;m extended to almo&s;t every thing great and &s;mall. For one, I wi&s;h, &s;ince it is gone thus far, that the breach had been &s;o com|pleat, as to make all intercour&s;e impracticable; but partly by accident, partly by de&s;ign, partly from the re&s;i&s;tance of the matter, enough is left to pre&s;erve intercour&s;e, whil&s;t amity is de&s;troyed or corrupted in it's principle.</P>
<P>This violent breach of the community of Eu|rope, we mu&s;t conclude to have been made, (even if they had not expre&s;sly declared it over and over again) either to force mankind into an adoption of their &s;y&s;tem, or to live in perpetual enmity with a community the mo&s;t potent we have ever known. Can any per&s;on imagine, that in offering to man|kind this de&s;perate alternative, there is no indica|tion of a ho&s;tile mind, becau&s;e men in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ruling authority are &s;uppo&s;ed to have a right to act without coercion in their own ter|ritories?

a &s;tate of <HI>total</HI> independence of each other. It is not the condition of our nature: nor is it conceiv|able how any man can pur&s;ue a con&s;iderable cour&s;e of action without it's having &s;ome effect upon others; or, of cour&s;e, without producing &s;ome de|gree of re&s;pon&s;ibility for his conduct. The <HI>&s;itu|ations</HI> in which men relatively &s;tand produce the rules and principles of that re&s;pon&s;ibility, and afford directions to prudence in exacting it.</P>
<P>Di&s;tance of place does not extingui&s;h the duties or the rights of men; but it often renders their exerci&s;e impracticable. The &s;ame circum&s;tance of di&s;tance renders the noxious effects of an evil &s;y&s;|tem in any community le&s;s pernicious. But there are &s;ituations where this difficulty does not occur; and in which, therefore, the&s;e duties are obligatory, and the&s;e rights are to be a&s;&s;erted. It has ever been the method of publick juri&s;ts to draw a great part of the analogies on which they form the law of nations, from the principles of law which prevail in civil community. Civil laws are not all of them merely po&s;itive. Tho&s;e which are rather con|clu&s;ions of legal rea&s;on, than matters of &s;tatutable provi&s;ion, belong to univer&s;al equity, and are uni|ver&s;ally applicable. Almo&s;t the whole praetorian law is &s;uch. There is a <HI>Law of Neighbourhood</HI> which does not leave a man perfect ma&s;ter on his own ground. When a neighbour &s;ees a <HI>new erection,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="115">
in the nature of a nui&s;ance, &s;et up at his door, he has a right to repre&s;ent it to the judge; who, on his part, has a right to order the work to be &s;taid; or if e&s;tabli&s;hed, to be removed. On this head, the parent law is expre&s;s and clear; and has made many wi&s;e provi&s;ions, which, without de&s;troying, regulate and re&s;train the right of <HI>owner&s;hip,</HI> by the right of <HI>vi|cinage.</HI> No <HI>innovation</HI> is permitted that may re|dound, even &s;econdarily, to the prejudice of a neighbour. The whole doctrine of that important head of praetorian law, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>De novi operis nunciatione,</HI>"</Q> is founded on the principle, that no <HI>new</HI> u&s;e &s;hould be made of a man's private liberty of operating upon his private property, from whence a detriment may be ju&s;tly apprehended by his neighbour. This law of denunciation is pro&s;pective. It is to anticipate what is called <HI>damnum infectum,</HI> or <HI>damnum nondum factum,</HI> that is a damage ju&s;tly apprehended but not actually done. Even before it is clearly known, whether the innovation be da|mageable or not, the judge is competent to i&s;&s;ue a prohibition to innovate, until the point can be de|termined. This prompt interference is grounded on principles favourable to both parties. It is pre|ventive of mi&s;chief difficult to be repaired, and of ill blood difficult to be &s;oftened. The rule of law, therefore, which comes before the evil, is among&s;t the very be&s;t parts of equity, and ju&s;tifies the promptne&s;s of the remedy; becau&s;e, as it is well

What in civil &s;ociety is a ground of action, in politick &s;ociety is a ground of war. But the exerci&s;e of that competent juri&s;dic|tion is a matter of moral prudence. As &s;uits in civil &s;ociety, &s;o war in the political mu&s;t ever be a matter of great deliberation.

There mu&s;t be marks of deliberation; there mu&s;t be traces of de&s;ign; there mu&s;t be indications of malice; there mu&s;t be tokens of ambition. There mu&s;t be force in the body where they exi&s;t; there mu&s;t be energy in the mind. When all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances combine, or the important parts of them, the duty of the vicinity calls for the exerci&s;e of it's competence; and the rules of prudence do not re&s;train, but demand it.</P>

No man who has attended to the particulars of what has

been done in France, and combined them with the principles there a&s;&s;erted, can po&s;&s;ibly doubt it. When I compare with this great cau&s;e of nations, the trifling points of honour, the &s;till more con|temptible points of intere&s;t, the light ceremonies, the undefinable punctilios, the di&s;putes about pre|cedency, the lowering or the hoi&s;ting of a fail, the dealing in a hundred or two of wild cat-&s;kins on the other &s;ide of the Globe, which have often kindled up the flames of war between nations, I &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed at tho&s;e per&s;ons, who do not feel a re&s;entment, not more natural than politick, at the atrocious in&s;ults that this mon&s;trous com|pound offers to the dignity of every nation, and who are not alarmed with what it threatens to their &s;afety.</P>
<P>I have therefore been decidedly of opinion, with our declaration at Whitehall, in the beginning of this war, that the vicinage of Europe had not only a right, but an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, and an exigent intere&s;t, to denunciate this new work before it had produced the danger we have &s;o &s;orely felt, and which we &s;hall long feel. The example of what is done by France is too important not to have a va&s;t and exten&s;ive influence; and that example backed with it's power, mu&s;t bear with great force on tho&s;e who are near it; e&s;pecially on tho&s;e who &s;hall re|cognize the pretended Republick on the principle

upon which it now &s;tands. It is not an old &s;truc|ture which you have found as it is, and are not to di&s;pute of the original end and de&s;ign with which it had been &s;o fa&s;hioned. It is a recent wrong, and can plead no pre&s;cription. It violates the rights upon which not only the community of France, but tho&s;e on which all communities are founded. The principles on which they proceed are <HI>general</HI> principles, and are as true in England as in any other country. They who (though with the pure&s;t intentions) recognize the autho|rity of the&s;e Regicides and robbers upon prin|ciple, ju&s;tify their acts, and e&s;tabli&s;h them as pre|cedents. It is a que&s;tion not between France and England. It is a que&s;tion between property and force. The property claims; and it's claim has been allowed. The property of the nation is the nation. They who ma&s;&s;acre, plunder, and expel the body of the proprietary, are murderers and rob|bers. The State, in it's e&s;&s;ence, mu&s;t be moral and ju&s;t: and it may be &s;o, though a tyrant or u&s;urper &s;hould be accidentally at the head of it. This is a thing to be lamented: but this not|with&s;tanding, the body of the commonwealth may remain in all it's integrity and be perfectly &s;ound in it's compo&s;ition. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e is different. It is not a revolution in government. It is not the victory of party over party. It is a de|&s;truction and decompo&s;ition of the whole &s;ociety;
<PB N="119" REF="120">
which never can be made of right by any faction, however powerful, nor without terrible con&s;equences to all about it, both in the act and in the example. This pretended Republick is founded in crimes, and exi&s;ts by wrong and robbery; and wrong and rob|bery, far from a title to any thing, is war with mankind. To be at peace with robbery is to be an accomplice with it.</P>
<P>Mere locality does not con&s;titute a body po|litick. Had Cade and his gang got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of London, they would not have been the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council. The body politick of France exi&s;ted in the maje&s;ty of it's throne; in the dignity of it's nobility; in the honour of it's gentry; in the &s;anctity of it's clergy: in the reverence of it's magi&s;tracy; in the weight and con&s;ideration due to it's landed property in the &s;everal bailliages; in the re&s;pect due to it's moveable &s;ub&s;tance repre&s;ented by the corporations of the kingdom. All the&s;e par|ticular <HI>moleculae</HI> united, form the great ma&s;s of what is truly the body politick in all coun|tries. They are &s;o many depo&s;its and recep|tacles of ju&s;tice; becau&s;e they can only exi&s;t by ju&s;tice.

What &s;hould I think of tho&s;e Potentates who in&s;ulted their &s;uffering brethren; who treated them as vagrants, or at lea&s;t as mendicants; and could find no allies, no friends, but in Regicide murderers and robbers? What ought I to think and feel, if being geographers in&s;tead of Kings, they re|cognized the de&s;olated cities, the wa&s;ted fields, and the rivers polluted with blood, of this geo|metrical mea&s;urement, as the honourable member of Europe, called England?

climates for a venal enlargement of their own territories, for the purpo&s;e of trucking them, when obtained, with tho&s;e very robbers and murderers they had called upon us to oppo&s;e with our blood? What would be our &s;entiments, if in that mi&s;era|ble &s;ervice we were not to be con&s;idered either as Engli&s;h, or as Swedes, Dutch, Danes, but as out|ca&s;ts of the human race? Whil&s;t we were fighting tho&s;e battles of their intere&s;t, and as their &s;oldiers, how &s;hould we feel if we were to be excluded from all their cartels? How mu&s;t we feel, if the pride and flower of the Engli&s;h Nobility and Gentry, who might e&s;cape the pe&s;tilential clime, and the devouring &s;word, &s;hould, if taken pri|&s;oners, be delivered over as rebel &s;ubjects, to be condemned as rebels, as traitors, as the vile&s;t of all criminals, by tribunals formed of Maroon ne|groe &s;laves, covered over with the blood of their ma&s;ters, who were made free and organi&s;ed into judges, for their robberies and murders? What &s;hould we feel under this inhuman, in&s;ulting, and barbarous protection of Mu&s;covites, Swedes or Hollanders? Should we not obte&s;t Heaven, and whatever ju&s;tice there is yet on Earth? Oppre&s;&s;ion makes wi&s;e men mad; but the di&s;temper is &s;till the madne&s;s of the wi&s;e, which is better than the &s;obriety of fools.

<P>And is then example nothing? It is every thing. Example is the &s;chool of mankind, and they will learn at no other. This war is a war again&s;t that example.

<P>I know that all I have &s;aid of the &s;y&s;tematick un&s;ociability of this new-invented &s;pecies of repub|lick, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of pre&s;erving peace, is an|&s;wered by a&s;&s;erting that the &s;cheme of manners, mo|rals, and even of maxims and principles of &s;tate, is of no weight in a que&s;tion of peace or war between communities. This doctrine is &s;upported by ex|ample.
<PB N="126" REF="127">
The ca&s;e of Algiers is cited, with an hint, as if it were the &s;tronger ca&s;e. I &s;hould take no notice of this &s;ort of inducement, if I had found it only where fir&s;t it was. I do not want re&s;pect for tho&s;e from whom I fir&s;t heard it&mdash;but having no controver&s;y at pre&s;ent with them, I only think it not ami&s;s to re&s;t on it a little, as I find it adopt|ed with much more of the &s;ame kind, by &s;everal of tho&s;e on whom &s;uch rea&s;oning had formerly made no apparent impre&s;&s;ion. If it had no force to pre|vent us from &s;ubmitting to this nece&s;&s;ary war, it furni&s;hes no better ground for our making an un|nece&s;&s;ary and ruinous peace,</P>
<P>This analogical argument drawn from the ca&s;e of Algiers would lead us a good way. The fact is, we our&s;elves with a little cover, others more directly, pay a <HI>tribute</HI> to the Republick of Algiers. Is it meant to reconcile us to the pay|ment of a <HI>tribute</HI> to the French Republick? That this, with other things more ruinous, will be de|manded hereafter, I little doubt; but for the pre|&s;ent, this will not be avowed&mdash;though our minds are to be gradually prepared for it. In truth, the arguments from this ca&s;e are worth little, even to tho&s;e who approve the buying an Algerine for bearance of piracy. There are many things which men do not approve, that they mu&s;t do to avoid a greater evil. To argue from thence, that they
<PB N="127" REF="128">
are to act in the &s;ame manner in all ca&s;es, is turning nece&s;&s;ity into a law. Upon what is mat|ter of prudence, the argument concludes the con|trary way. Becau&s;e we have done one humiliat|ing act, we ought, with infinite caution, to admit more acts of the &s;ame nature, le&s;t humiliation &s;hould become our habitual &s;tate. Matters of pru|dence are under the dominion of circum&s;tances, and not of logical analogies. It is &s;o ab&s;urd to take it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I, for one, do more than doubt the policy of this kind of convention with Algiers. On tho&s;e who think as I do, the argument <HI>ad hominem</HI> can make no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion. I know &s;omething of the Con&s;titution and compo&s;ition of this very extra|ordinary Republick. It has a Con&s;titution, I admit, &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent tumultuous military tyranny of France, by which an handful of ob&s;cure ruffians domineer over a fertile country, and a brave people. For the compo&s;ition, too, I admit, the Algerine community re&s;embles that of France; being form|ed out of the very &s;cum, &s;candal, di&s;grace, and pe&s;t of the Turki&s;h A&s;ia. The grand Seignor, to di&s;bur|then the country, &s;uffers the Dey to recruit, in his dominions, the corps of Jani&s;aries, or A&s;aphs, which form the Directory and Council of Elders of the African Republick one and indivi&s;ible. But notwith&s;tanding this re&s;emblance, which I allow, I
<PB N="128" REF="129">
never &s;hall &s;o far injure the Jani&s;arian Repub|lick of Algiers, as to put it in compari&s;on for every &s;ort of crime, turpitude, and oppre&s;&s;ion with the Jacobin Republick of Paris. There is no que&s;tion with me to which of the two I &s;hould choo&s;e to be a neighbour or a &s;ubject. But &s;ituated as I am, I am in no danger of becoming to Algiers either the one or the other. It is not &s;o in my relation to the athei&s;tical fanaticks of France. I <HI>am</HI> their neigh|bour; I <HI>may</HI> become their &s;ubject. Have the Gen|tlemen who borrowed this happy parallel, no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the very &s;ame evil at an immen&s;e di&s;|tance, and when it is at your door? when it's power is enormous, as when it is comparatively as feeble as it's di&s;tance is remote? when there is a barrier of language and u&s;ages, which prevents corruption through certain old corre&s;pondences and habi|tudes, from the contagion of the horrible novel|ties that are introduced into every thing el&s;e? I can contemplate, without dread, a royal or a national tyger on the borders of Pegu. I can look at him, with an ea&s;y curio&s;ity, as pri&s;oner within bars in the menagerie of the Tower. But if, by Habeas Corpus, or otherwi&s;e, he was to come into the Lobby of the Hou&s;e of Commons whil&s;t your door was open, any of you would be more &s;tout than wi&s;e, who would not gladly make your e&s;cape out of the back windows. I certainly
<PB N="129" REF="130">
&s;hould dread more from a wild cat in my bed|chamber, than from all the lions that roar in the de&s;erts behind Algiers. But in this parallel it is the cat that is at a di&s;tance, and the lions and ty|gers that are in our anti-chambers and our lobbies. Algiers is not near; Algiers is not powerful; Al|giers is not our neighbour; Algiers is not infec|tious. Algiers, whatever it may be, is an old crea|tion; and we have good data to calculate all the mi&s;chief to be apprehended from it. When I find Algiers transferred to Calais, I will tell you what I think of that point. In the mean time, the ca&s;e quoted from the Algerine reports, will not apply as authority. We &s;hall put it out of court; and &s;o far as that goes, let the coun&s;el for the Jacobin peace take nothing by their motion.</P>
<P>When we voted, as you and I did, with many more whom you and I re&s;pect and love, to re&s;i&s;t this enemy, we were providing for dangers that were direct, home, pre&s;&s;ing, and not remote, contingent, uncertain, and formed upon loo&s;e analogies. We judged of the danger with which we were menaced by Jacobin France, from the whole tenor of her conduct; not from one or two doubtful or detached acts or expre&s;&s;ions. I not only concurred in the idea of combining with Europe in this war; but to the be&s;t of my power ever &s;timulated Mini&s;ters to that conjunction of intere&s;ts and of efforts. I joined

I think his manife&s;t attempt to overturn the balance of Europe, a good ground of war. As a good ground of war, I con&s;ider his declaration of war on his Maje&s;ty and his kingdom. But though I have taken all the&s;e to my aid, I con&s;ider them as nothing more than as a &s;ort of evidence to indicate the trea&s;onable mind within&punc; Long before their acts of aggre&s;&s;ion, and their declaration of war, the faction in France had a&s;&s;umed a form, had adopt|ed a body of principles and maxims, and had regu|larly and &s;y&s;tematically acted on them, by which &s;he virtually had put her&s;elf in a po&s;ture, which was in it&s;elf a declaration of war again&s;t mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">It is &s;aid by the Directory in their &s;everal ma|nife&s;toes, that we of the people are tumultuous for peace; and that Mini&s;ters pretend negociation to amu&s;e us.

<P>Before our opinions are quoted again&s;t our&s;elves, it is proper that, from our &s;erious deliberation, they may be worth quoting.

To have no other mea&s;ure in judging of tho&s;e great ob|jects than our momentary opinions and de&s;ires, is to throw us back upon that very democracy which, in this part, our Con&s;titution was formed to avoid.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">It is no excu&s;e at all for a mini&s;ter, who at our de&s;ire, takes a mea&s;ure contrary to our &s;afety, that it is our own act. He who does not &s;tay the hand of &s;uicide, is guilty of murder. On our part I &s;ay, that to be in&s;tructed, is not to be degraded or en&s;laved. Information is an advantage to us; and we have a right to de|mand it. He that is bound to act in the dark cannot be &s;aid to act freely. When it appears evi|dent to our governors that our de&s;ires and our in|tere&s;ts are at variance, they ought not to gratify the former at the expence of the latter. State&s;men are placed on an eminence, that they may have a larger horizon than we can po&s;&s;ibly command. They have a whole before them, which we can contemplate only in the parts, and even without the nece&s;&s;ary relations. Mini&s;ters are not only our natural rulers but our natural guides. Rea&s;on clearly and manfully delivered, has in it&s;elf a mighty force: but rea&s;on in the mouth of legal authority, is, I may fairly &s;ay, irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>I admit that rea&s;on of &s;tate will not, in many cir|cum&s;tances permit the di&s;clo&s;ure of the true ground of a public proceeding. In that ca&s;e &s;ilence is manly and it is wi&s;e. It is fair to call for tru&s;t when the principle of rea&s;on it&s;elf &s;u&s;pends it's public u&s;e. I take the di&s;tinction to be this: The ground of a particular mea&s;ure, making a part of

a plan, it is rarely proper to divulge; all the broader grounds of policy on which the general plan is to be adopted, ought as rarely to be con|cealed. They who have not the whole cau&s;e be|fore them, call them politicians, call them people, call them what you will, are no judges. The dif|ficulties of the ca&s;e, as well as it's fair &s;ide, ought to be pre&s;ented. This ought to be done: and it is all that can be done. When we have our true &s;i|tuation di&s;tinctly pre&s;ented to us, if then we re&s;olve with a blind and headlong violence, to re&s;i&s;t the admonitions of our friends, and to ca&s;t our&s;elves into the hands of our potent and irreconcileable foes, then, and not till then, the mini&s;ters &s;tand acquitted before God and man, for whatever may come.</P>
<P>Lamenting as I do, that the matter has not had &s;o full and free a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as it requires, I mean to omit none of the points which &s;eem to me nece&s;&s;ary for con&s;ideration, previous to an ar|rangement which is for ever to decide the form and the fate of Europe. In the cour&s;e, there|fore, of what I &s;hall have the honour to addre&s;s to you, I propo&s;e the following que&s;tions to your &s;e|rious thoughts. 1. Whether the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, which &s;tands for a Government in France, be &s;uch as in peace and war affects the neighbouring States in a manner different from the internal Govern|ment
<PB N="134" REF="135">
that formerly prevailed in that country? 2. Whether that &s;y&s;tem, &s;uppo&s;ing it's views ho&s;tile to other nations, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any means of being hurtful to them peculiar to it&s;elf? 3. Whether there has been lately &s;uch a change in France, as to alter the nature of it's &s;y&s;tem, or it's effect upon other Powers? 4. Whether any publick de|clarations or engagements exi&s;t, on the part of the allied Powers, which &s;tand in the way of a treaty of peace, which &s;uppo&s;es the right and confirms the power of the Regicide faction in France? 5. What the &s;tate of the other Powers of Europe will be with re&s;pect to each other, and their colonies, on the conclu&s;ion of a Regicide Peace? 6. Whe|ther we are driven to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of making that kind of peace?</P>
<P>The&s;e heads of enquiry will enable us to make the application of the &s;everal matters of fact and topicks of argument, that occur in this va&s;t di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, to certain fixed principles. I do not mean to confine my&s;elf to the order in which they &s;tand. I &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s them in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall appear to me the be&s;t adapted for &s;hewing their mutual bearings and relations. Here then I clo&s;e the public matter of my Letter; but before I have done, let me &s;ay one word in apology for my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">In wi&s;hing this nominal peace not to be precipi|tated, I am &s;ure no man living is le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to blame the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try than I am.

There are &s;ome indeed, <Q REND="inline">"whom my dim eyes in vain explore."</Q>In my mind, a greater calamity could not have fallen on the publick than the exclu&s;ion of one of them. But I drive away that, with other melancholy thoughts. A great deal ought to be &s;aid upon that &s;ubject or nothing. As to the di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons to whom my friends who remain, are joined, if benefits, nobly and generou&s;ly conferred, ought to procure good wi&s;hes, they are intitled to my be&s;t vows; and they have them all.

If the finances in &s;uch a ca&s;e can be repaired, he is the man to repair them. If I &s;hould lament any of his acts, it is only when they appear to me to have no re&s;emblance to acts of his. But

let him not have a confidence in him&s;elf, which no human abilities can warrant. His abilities are fully equal (and that is to &s;ay much for any man) to tho&s;e which are oppo&s;ed to him. But if we look to him as our &s;ecurity again&s;t the con&s;e|quences of a Regicide Peace, let us be a&s;&s;ured, that a Regicide Peace and a Con&s;titutional Mini&s;try are terms that will not agree. With a Regicide Peace the King cannot long have a Mini&s;ter to &s;erve him, nor the Mini&s;ter a King to &s;erve. If the Great Di&s;po&s;er, in reward of the royal and the private virtues of our Sovereign, &s;hould call him from the calamitous &s;pectacles, which will attend a &s;tate of amity with Regicide, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or will &s;urely &s;ee them, unle&s;s the &s;ame Providence greatly antici|pates the cour&s;e of nature. Thinking thus, (and not, as I conceive, on light grounds) I dare not flatter the reigning Sovereign, nor any Mini&s;ter he has or can have, nor his Succe&s;&s;or Apparent, nor any of tho&s;e who may be called to &s;erve him, with what appears to me a fal&s;e &s;tate of their &s;ituation.

<P>I do not forget that there had been a con&s;ider|able difference between &s;everal of our friends, with my in&s;ignificant &s;elf, and the great man at the head of Mini&s;try, in an early &s;tage of the&s;e di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions.

It is becau&s;e I am old and &s;low.&mdash; I am in this year, 1796, only where all the powers of Europe were in 1793.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER II.</HI> On the Genius and Character of the French Revolution as it regards other Nations.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Clo&s;ed my fir&s;t Letter with &s;erious matter; and I hope it has employed your thoughts. The &s;y&s;tem of peace mu&s;t have a reference to the &s;y&s;tem of the war. On that ground, I mu&s;t therefore again recal your mind to our original opinions, which time and events have not taught me to vary.</P>
<P>My ideas and my principles led me, in this conte&s;t, to encounter France, not as a State, but as a Faction. The va&s;t territorial extent of that country, it's immen&s;e population, it's riches of production, it's riches of commerce and con|vention&mdash;the whole aggregate ma&s;s of what, in ordinary ca&s;es, con&s;titutes the force of a State, to me were but objects of &s;econdary con&s;idera|tion. They might be balanced; and they have
<PB N="140" REF="141">
been often more than balanced. Great as the&s;e things are, they are not what make the faction formidable. It is the faction that makes them truly dreadful. That faction is the evil &s;pirit that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the body of France; that informs it as a &s;oul; that &s;tamps upon it's ambition, and upon all it's pur&s;uits, a characteri&s;tick mark, which &s;trongly di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the &s;ame general pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;ame general views, in other men and in other communities. It is that &s;pirit which in&s;pires into them, a new, a perni|cious, a de&s;olating activity. Con&s;tituted as France was ten years ago, it was not in that France to &s;hake, to &s;hatter, and to over|whelm Europe in the manner that we behold. A &s;ure de&s;truction impends over tho&s;e infatuated Princes, who, in the conflict with this new and unheard-of power, proceed as if they were en|gaged in a war that bore a re&s;emblance to their former conte&s;ts; or that they can make peace in the &s;pirit of their former arrangements of pa|cification. Here the beaten path is the very rever&s;e of the &s;afe road.</P>
<P>As to me, I was always &s;teadily of opi|nion, that this di&s;order was not in it's nature intermittent. I conceived that the conte&s;t once begun, could not be laid down again, to be re&s;umed at our di&s;cretion; but that our
<PB N="141" REF="142">
fir&s;t &s;truggle with this evil would al&s;o be our la&s;t. I never thought we could make peace with the &s;y&s;tem; becau&s;e it was not for the &s;ake of an object we pur&s;ued in rivalry with each other, but with the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf that we were at war. As I under&s;tood the matter, we were at war not with it's conduct, but with it's exi&s;t|ence; convinced that it's exi&s;tence and it's ho&s;|tility were the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The faction is not local or territorial. It is a general evil. Where it lea&s;t appears in action, it is &s;till full of life. In it's &s;leep it recruits it's &s;trength, and prepares it's exertion. It's &s;pirit lies deep in the corruptions of our common nature. The &s;ocial order which re&s;trains it, feeds it. It exi&s;ts in every country in Europe; and among all orders of men in every country, who look up to France as to a common head. The centre is there. The circumference is the world of Eu|rope wherever the race of Europe may be &s;et|tled. Every where el&s;e the faction is militant; in France it is triumphant. In France is the bank of depo&s;it, and the bank of circulation, of all the pernicious principles that are forming in every State. It will be a folly &s;carcely de&s;erving of pity, and too mi&s;chievous for contempt, to think of re&s;training it in any other country whil&s;t it is predominant there. War, in&s;tead of
<PB N="142" REF="143">
being the cau&s;e of it's force, has &s;u&s;pended it's operation&punc; It has given a reprieve, at lea&s;t, to the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>The true nature of a Jacobin war, in the be|ginning, was, by mo&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Powers, felt, acknowledged, and even in the mo&s;t pre|ci&s;e manner declared. In the joint manife&s;to, publi&s;hed by the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, on the 4th of Augu&s;t 1792, it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the cleare&s;t terms, and on principles which could not fail, if they had adhered to them, of cla&s;&s;ing tho&s;e monarchs with the fir&s;t benefactors of mankind. This manife&s;to was publi&s;hed, as they them&s;elves expre&s;s it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to lay open to the pre&s;ent generation, as well as to po&s;terity, their motives, their intentions, and the <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> of their per&s;onal views; taking up arms for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving &s;ocial and political order among&s;t all civilized nations, and to &s;ecure to <HI>each</HI> &s;tate it's reli|gion, happine&s;s, independence, territories, and real con&s;titution."&mdash;"On this ground, they hoped that all Empires, and all States, ought to be unanimous; and becoming the firm guardians of the happine&s;s of mankind, that they cannot fail to unite their efforts to re&s;cue a numerous nation from it's own fury, to pre|&s;erve Europe from the return of barbari&s;m,
<PB N="143" REF="144">
and the Univer&s;e from the &s;ubver&s;ion and anarchy with which it was threatened."</Q> The whole of that noble performance ought to be read at the fir&s;t meeting of any Congre&s;s, which may a&s;&s;emble for the purpo&s;e of pacification. In that piece  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the&s;e Powers expre&s;sly renounce all views of per&s;onal aggrandizement,"</Q> and confine them&s;elves to objects worthy of &s;o generous, &s;o heroic, and &s;o perfectly wi&s;e and politick an en|terpri&s;e. It was to the principles of this confe|deration and to no other, that we wi&s;hed our Sovereign and our Country to accede, as a part of the commonwealth of Europe. To the&s;e principles with &s;ome trifling exceptions and limitations they did fully accede.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Declaration. Whitehall, Oct. 29, 1793.</NOTE> And all our friends who did take office acceded to the Mi|ni&s;try (whether wi&s;ely or not) as I always un|der&s;tood the matter, on the faith and on the principles of that declaration.</P>
<P>As long as the&s;e powers flattered them&s;elves that the menace of force would produce the ef|fect of force, they acted on tho&s;e declarations: but when their menaces failed of &s;ucce&s;s, their efforts took a new direction. It did not appear to them that virtue and heroi&s;m ought to be pur|cha&s;ed by millions of rix-dollars. It is a dreadful
<PB N="144" REF="145">
truth, but it is a truth that cannot be concealed; in ability, in dexterity, in the di&s;tinctne&s;s of their views, the Jacobins are our &s;uperiours. They &s;aw the thing right from the very beginning. What|ever were the fir&s;t motives to the war among politicians, they &s;aw that it is in it's &s;pirit, and for it's objects, a <HI>civil war</HI>; and as &s;uch they pur&s;ued it. It is a war between the partizans of the antient, civil, moral, and political order of Europe again&s;t a &s;ect of fanatical and ambi|tious athei&s;ts which means to change them all. It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a &s;ect aiming at univer&s;al empire, and beginning with the conque&s;t of France. The leaders of that &s;ect &s;ecured the <HI>centre of Europe</HI>; and that &s;ecured, they knew, that whatever might be the event of battles and &s;ieges, their <HI>cau&s;e</HI> was victorious. Whether it's territory had a little more or a little le&s;s peeled from it's &s;urface, or whether an i&s;land or two was detached from it's commerce, to them was of little moment. The conque&s;t of France was a glorious acqui&s;ition. That once well laid as a ba&s;is of empire, opportunities never could be wanting to regain or to replace what had been lo&s;t, and dreadfully to avenge them&s;elves on the faction of their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">They &s;aw it was a <HI>civil war.</HI> It was their bu|&s;ine&s;s to per&s;uade their adver&s;aries that it ought to be a <HI>foreign</HI> war. The Jacobins every where &s;et up a cry again&s;t the new cru&s;ade; and they intrigued with effect in the cabinet, in the field, and in every private &s;ociety in Europe. Their ta&s;k was not difficult. The condition of Princes, and &s;ometimes of fir&s;t Mini&s;ters too, is to be pitied. The creatures of the de&s;k, and the creatures of favour, had no reli&s;h for the principles of the manife&s;toes. They pro|mi&s;ed no governments, no regiments, no reve|nues from whence emoluments might ari&s;e, by perqui&s;ite or by grant. In truth, the tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowe&s;t of our &s;pecies. There is no trade &s;o vile and mechanical as go|vernment in their hands. Virtue is not their habit. They are out of them&s;elves in any cour&s;e of conduct recommended only by con&s;cience and glory. A large, liberal and pro&s;pective view of the intere&s;ts of States pa&s;&s;es with them for romance; and the principles that recom|mend it for the wanderings of a di&s;ordered imagination. The calculators compute them out of their &s;en&s;es. The je&s;ters and buffoons &s;hame them out of every thing grand and ele|vated. Littlene&s;s in object and in means, to them appears &s;oundne&s;s and &s;obriety. They think there is nothing worth pur&s;uit, but that which
<PB N="146" REF="147">
they can handle; which they can mea&s;ure with a two-foot rule; which they can tell upon ten fingers.</P>
<P>Without the principles of the Jacobins, per|hap w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">hout any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rinciples at all, they played the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e of that faction. There was a beaten road befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e them. The Powers of Europe were arm|ed; France had always appeared dangerous; the war was ea&s;ily diverted from France as a fac|tion, to France as a &s;tate. The Princes were ea&s;ily taught to &s;lide back into their old habitual cour&s;e of politicks. They were ea&s;ily led to con&s;ider the flames that were con&s;uming France, not as a warning to protect their own buildings&punc; (which we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e without any pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty wall, and linked by a contignation into the edifice of France.) as an happy occa&s;ion for pillag|ing the goods, and for carrying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ff the materials of their neighbour's hou&s;e. Their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes. They car|ried on their new de&s;igns without &s;eeming to abandon the principles of their old policy. They pretended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">k, or they flattered them&s;elves tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> they &s;ought, in the acce&s;&s;ion of new for|tre&s;&s;es, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ew territories, a <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> &s;ecurity. But the &s;ecurity wanted was again&s;t a kind of power which was not &s;o truly dangerous in it's fortre&s;&s;es nor in it's territories, as in it's &s;pirit and
<PB N="147" REF="148">
it's principles. They aimed, or pretended to aim, at <HI>defending</HI> them&s;elves again&s;t a danger, from which there can be no &s;ecurity in any <HI>de|fen&s;ive</HI> plan. If armies and fortre&s;&s;es were a de|fence again&s;t Jacobini&s;m, Louis the Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people.</P>
<P>This error obliged them, even in their offen|&s;ive operations, to adopt a plan of war, again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of which there was &s;omething little &s;hort of mathematical demon&s;tration. They refu&s;ed to take any &s;tep which might &s;trike at the heart of affairs. They &s;eemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital part. They acted through the whole, as if they really wi&s;hed the con&s;ervation of the Jacobin power; as what might be more favourable than the lawful Go|vernment to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for. They always kept on the cir|cumference; and the wider and remoter the circle was, the more eagerly they cho&s;e it as their &s;phere of action in this centrifugal war. The plan they pur&s;ued, in it's nature demanded great length of time. In it's execution, they, who went the near|e&s;t way to work, were obliged to cover an incre|dible extent of country. It left to the enemy every means of de&s;troying this extended line of weakne&s;s. Ill &s;ucce&s;s in any part was &s;ure to de|feat
<PB N="148" REF="149">
the effect of the whole. This is true of Au&s;|tria It is &s;till more true of England. On this fal&s;e plan, even good fortune, by further weak|ening the victor, put him but the further off from his object.</P>
<P>As long as there was any appearance of &s;uc|ce&s;s, the &s;pirit of aggrandizement, and con&s;e|quently the &s;pirit of mutual jealou&s;y &s;eized upon all the coale&s;ced Powers. Some &s;ought an ac|ce&s;&s;ion of territory at the expence of France, &s;ome at the expence of each other; &s;ome at the expence of third parties; and when the vici&s;&s;i|tude of di&s;a&s;ter took it's turn, they found com|mon di&s;tre&s;s a treacherous bond of faith and friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>It was not of that &s;ort of war that I was among&s;t the lea&s;t con&s;iderable, but among&s;t the mo&s;t zealous advi&s;ers; and it is not by the &s;ort of peace now talked of, that I wi&s;h it concluded.

There could be no tie of a common <HI>intere&s;t</HI> where the object did not offer &s;uch a divi&s;ion among&s;t the parties, as could well give them a warm concern in the gains of each other, or could indeed form &s;uch a body of equivalents, as might make one of

them willing to abandon a &s;eparate object of his ambition for the gratification of any other member of the alliance. The partition of Poland offered an object of &s;poil in which the parties <HI>might</HI> agree. They were circumjacent; and each might take a portion convenient to his own territory. They might di&s;pute about the value of their &s;everal &s;hares, but the contiguity to each of the demandants always furni&s;hed the means of an adju&s;tment.

<P>I don't find it denied, that when a treaty is entered into for peace, a demand will be made on the Regicides to &s;urrender a great part of their conque&s;ts on the Continent. Will they, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the war, make that &s;ur|render without an equivalent? This continental ce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t of cour&s;e be made in favour of that party in the alliance, that has &s;uffered-lo&s;&s;es. That party has nothing to furni&s;h towards an equivalent. What equivalent, for in&s;tance, has
<PB N="152" REF="153">
Holland to offer, who has lo&s;t her all? What equivalent can come from the Emperor, every part of who&s;e territories contiguous to France, is already within the pale of the Regicide domi|nion? What equivalent has Sardinia to offer for Savoy and for Nice, I may &s;ay for her whole being? What has &s;he taken from the faction of France? She has lo&s;t very near her all; and &s;he has gained nothing. What equivalent has Spain to give? Alas! &s;he has already paid for her own ran&s;om the fund of equivalent, and a dreadful equiva|lent it is, to England and to her&s;elf. But I put Spain out of the que&s;tion. She is a province of the Jacobin Empire, and &s;he mu&s;t make peace or war according to the orders &s;he receives from the Directory of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. In effect and &s;ub|&s;tance, her Crown is a fief of Regicide.</P>
<P>Whence then can the compen&s;ation be de|manded? Undoubtedly from that power which alone has made &s;ome conque&s;ts. That power is England. Will the allies then give away their antient patrimony, that England may keep I&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies? They never can protract the war in good earne&s;t for that object; nor can they act in concert with us, in our refu&s;al to grant any thing towards their redemption. In that ca&s;e we are thus &s;ituated. Either we mu&s;t give Europe, bound hand and foot to France;
<PB N="153" REF="154">
or we mu&s;t quit the We&s;t Indies without any one object, great or &s;mall, towards indemnity and &s;ecurity. I repeat it without any advantage whatever: becau&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing that our conque&s;t could comprize all that France ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the tropical America, it never can amount in any fair e&s;timation to a fair equivalent for Hol|land, for the Au&s;trian Netherlands, for the lower Germany, that is for the whole antient kingdom or circle of Burgundy, now under the yoke of Regicide, to &s;ay nothing of almo&s;t all Italy under the &s;ame barbarous domination. If we treat in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things, we have nothing in our hands that can redeem Europe. Nor is the Emperor, as I have ob|&s;erved, more rich in the fund of equivalents.</P>
<P>If we look to our &s;tock in the Ea&s;tern world, our mo&s;t valuable and &s;y&s;tematick acqui&s;itions are made in that quarter. Is it from France. they are made? France has but one or two con|temptible factories, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by the offal of the private fortunes of Engli&s;h individuals to &s;upport them, in any part of India. I look on the taking of the Cape of Good Hope as the &s;ecuring of a po&s;t of great moment. It does honour to tho&s;e who planned, and to tho&s;e who executed that enterprize: but I &s;peak of it al|ways as compararively good; as good as any

thing can be in a &s;cheme of war that repels us from a centre, and employs all our forces where nothing can be finally deci&s;ive. But giving, as I freely give, every po&s;&s;ible credit to the&s;e ea&s;tern conque&s;ts, I a&s;k one que&s;tion, on whom are they made? It is evident, that if we can keep our ea&s;tern conque&s;ts, we keep them not at the expence of France, but at the expence of Hol|land our <HI>ally</HI>; of Holland the immediate cau&s;e of the war, the nation whom we had un|dertaken to protect, and not of the Republic which it was our bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;troy. If we re|turn the African and the A&s;iatick conque&s;ts, we put them into the hands of a nominal State, (to that Holland is reduced) unable to retain them; and which will virtually leave them under the direction of France. If we withhold them, Holland declines &s;till more as a State; and &s;he lo&s;es &s;o much carrying trade and that means of keeping up the &s;mall degree of naval power &s;he holds; for which policy alone, and not for any commercial gain, &s;he maintains the Cape, or any &s;ettlement beyond it. In that ca&s;e, re&s;entment, faction, and even nece&s;&s;ity will throw her more and more into the power of the new mi&s;chievous Republick. But on the probable &s;tate of Hol|land, I &s;hall &s;ay more, when in this corre&s;pon|dence I come to talk over with you the &s;tate in
<PB N="155" REF="156">
which any &s;ort of Jacobin peace will leave all Europe.</P>
<P>So far as to the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>As to the We&s;t Indies, indeed as to either, if we look for matter of exchange in order to ran|&s;om Europe, it is ea&s;y to &s;hew that we have taken a terribly roundabout road. I cannot conceive, even if, for the &s;ake of holding conque&s;ts there, we &s;hould refu&s;e to redeem Holland, and the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and the hither Germany, that Spain, merely as &s;he is Spain, (and forgetting that the Regicide Am|ba&s;&s;ador governs at Madrid) will &s;ee with per|fect &s;atisfaction, Great Britain &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the I&s;les. In truth it appears to me, that, when we come to balance our account, we &s;hall find in the propo&s;ed peace only the pure, &s;imple, and unendowed charms of Jacobin amity. We &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction of knowing, that no blood or trea&s;ure has been &s;pared by the allies for &s;up|port of the Regicide &s;y&s;tem. We &s;hall reflect at lei&s;ure on one great truth, that it was ten times more ea&s;y totally to de&s;troy the &s;y&s;tem it|&s;elf, than when e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would be to re|duce it's power&mdash;and that this Republick, mo&s;t formidable abroad, was, of all things, the weak|e&s;t at home; That her frontier was terrible&mdash;

her interior feeble&mdash;that it was matter of choice to attack her where &s;he is invincible; and to &s;pare her where &s;he was ready to di&s;&s;olve by her own internal di&s;orders. We &s;hall reflect, that our plan was good neither for offence nor de|fence.</P>

depths of this de&s;pair, an impul&s;e which I have in vain endeavoured to re&s;i&s;t, has urged me to rai&s;e one feeble cry again&s;t this unfortunate coalition which is formed at home, in order to make a coalition with France, &s;ubver&s;ive of the whole ancient order of the world. No di&s;a&s;ter of war, no calamity of &s;ea&s;on could ever &s;trike me with half the horror which I felt from what is introduced to us by this junction of parties, under the &s;oothing name of peace.

<P>The Revolution in France had the relation of France to other nations as one of it's princi|pal objects. The changes made by that Revo|lution were not the better to accommodate her to the old and u&s;ual relations, but to produce new ones. The Revolution was made, not to make France free, but to make her formid|able; not to make her a neighbour, but a mi&s;|tre&s;s; not to make her more ob&s;ervant of laws, but to put her in a condition to impo&s;e them. To make France truly formidable it was nece&s;|&s;ary that France &s;hould be new-modelled. They who have not followed the train of the late pro|ceedings, have been led by deceitful repre&s;enta|tions (which deceit made a part in the plan) to conceive that this totally new model of a &s;tate in which nothing e&s;caped a change, was made with a view to it's internal relations only.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">In the Revolution of France two &s;orts of men were principally concerned in giving a character and determination to it's pur&s;uits; the philo&s;o|phers and the politicians. They took different ways, but they met in the &s;ame end. The philo|&s;ophers had one predominant object, which they pur&s;ued with a fanatical fury, that is, the utter extirpation of religion. To that every que&s;tion of empire was &s;ubordinate. They had rather domi|neer in a pari&s;h of Athei&s;ts, than rule over a Chri&s;|tian world. Their temporal ambition was wholly &s;ub&s;ervient to their pro&s;elytizing &s;pirit, in which they were not exceeded by Mahomet him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They who have made but &s;uperficial &s;tudies in the Natural Hi&s;tory of the human mind, have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only cau&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;tick zeal, and &s;ec|tarian propagation. But there is no doctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of the very &s;ame effect. The &s;ocial nature of man impels him to propagate his prin|ciples, as much as phy&s;ical impul&s;es urge him to propagate his kind. The pa&s;&s;ions give zeal and vehemence. The under&s;tanding be&s;tows de&s;ign and &s;y&s;tem. The whole man moves under the di&s;cipline of his opinions. Religion is among the mo&s;t powerful cau&s;es of enthu&s;ia&s;m. When
<PB N="161" REF="162">
any thing concerning it becomes an object of much meditation, it cannot be indifferent to the mind. They who do not love religion, hate it. The rebels to God perfectly abhor the Author of their being. They hate him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with all their heart, with all their mind, with all their &s;oul, and with all their &s;trength."</Q> He never pre|&s;ents him&s;elf to their thoughts, but to menace and alarm them. They cannot &s;trike the Sun out of Heaven, but they are able to rai&s;e a &s;moulder|ing &s;moke that ob&s;cures him from their own eyes. Not being able to revenge them&s;elves on God, they have a delight in vicariou&s;ly defacing, degrading, torturing, and tearing in pieces his image in man. Let no one judge of them by what he has conceived of them, when they were not incorporated, and had no lead. They were then only pa&s;&s;engers in a common vehicle. They were then carried along with the general motion of religion in the community, and with|out being aware of it, partook of it's influence. In that &s;ituation, at wor&s;t their nature was left free to counterwork their principles. They de|&s;paired of giving any very general currency to their opinions. They con&s;idered them as a re|&s;erved privilege for the cho&s;en few. But when the po&s;&s;ibility of dominion, lead, and propaga|tion pre&s;ented them&s;elves, and that the ambi|tion, which before had &s;o often made them hy|pocrites,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
might rather gain than lo&s;e by a daring avowal of their &s;entiments, then the nature of this infernal &s;pirit, which has <Q REND="inline">"evil for it's good"</Q>appeared in it's full perfection. Nothing indeed but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome power can with any certainty di&s;cover, what at the bottom is the true character of any man. Without read|ing the &s;peeches of Vergniaux, Fran&ccedil;ais of Nantz, I&s;nard, and &s;ome others of that &s;ort, it would not be ea&s;y to conceive the pa&s;&s;ion, ran|cour, and malice of their tongues and hearts. They worked them&s;elves up to a perfect phrenzy again&s;t religion and all it's profe&s;&s;ors. They tore the reputation of the Clergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives, be|fore they lacerated their bodies by their ma&s;|&s;acres. This fanatical athei&s;m left out, we omit the principal feature in the French Revolution, and a principal con&s;ideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a peace with it.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of men were the politicians, To them who had little or not at all reflected on the &s;ubject, religion was in it&s;elf no object of love or hatred. They di&s;believed it, and that was all. Neutral with regard to that object, they took the &s;ide which in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things might be&s;t an&s;wer their purpo&s;es. They &s;oon found that they could not do without the philo|&s;ophers;
<PB N="163" REF="164">
and the philo&s;ophers &s;oon made them &s;en&s;ible, that the de&s;truction of religion was to &s;upply them with means of conque&s;t fir&s;t at home, and then abroad. The philo&s;ophers were the active internal agitators, and &s;up|plied the &s;pirit and principles: the &s;econd gave the practical direction. Sometimes the one predominated in the compo&s;ition, &s;ometimes the other. The only difference between them was in the nece&s;&s;ity of concealing the general de|&s;ign for a time, and in their dealing with foreign nations; the fanaticks going &s;trait forward and openly, the politicians by the &s;urer mode of zigzag. In the cour&s;e of events this, among other cau&s;es, produced fierce and bloody con|tentions between them.

<P>Without que&s;tion, to bring about the un|exampled event of the French revolution, the concurrence of a very great number of views and pa&s;&s;ions was nece&s;&s;ary.

of tho&s;e who acted in the Revolution <HI>as &s;tate&s;men,</HI> had the exterior aggrandizement of France as their ultimate end in the mo&s;t minute part of the internal changes that were made.

The whole official &s;y&s;tem, particularly in the diplomatic part, the regulars, the irregulars, down to the clerks in office, (a corps, without all compari&s;on, more numerous than the &s;ame among&s;t us) co-operated in it.

France, diverted from the politicks of the continent, to attend &s;olely to her marine, to feed it by an encrea&s;e of commerce, and thereby to overpower England on her own element. They contended, that if England were di&s;abled, the Powers on the continent would fall into their proper &s;ubordination; that it was England which deranged the whole conti|nental &s;y&s;tem of Europe. The others, who were by far the more numerous, though not the mo&s;t outwardly prevalent at Court, con&s;idered this plan for France as contrary to her genius, her &s;ituation, and her natural means. They agreed as to the ultimate object, the reduction of the Briti&s;h power, and if po&s;&s;ible, it's naval power; but they con&s;idered an a&s;cendancy on the continent as a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary to that undertaking. They argued, that the proceed|ings of England her&s;elf had proved the &s;ound|ne&s;s of this policy. That her greate&s;t and able&s;t State&s;men had not con&s;idered the &s;upport of a continental balance again&s;t France as a devia|tion from the principle of her naval power, but as one of the mo&s;t effectual modes of carrying it into effect. That &s;uch had been her po|licy ever &s;ince the Revolution; during which pe|riod the naval &s;trength of Great Britain had gone on encrea&s;ing in the direct ratio of her interference in the politicks of the conti|nent.

Nor was there one Court in which an Amba&s;&s;ador re&s;ided on the part of the Mi|ni&s;ters, in which another as a &s;py on him did not al&s;o re&s;ide on the part of the King.

An in|extricable cabal was formed, &s;ome of per&s;ons of rank, others of &s;ubordinates. But by this

<P>There was no point on which the di&s;contented diplomatic politicians &s;o bitterly arraigned their Cabinet, as for the decay of French influ|ence in all others. From quarrelling with the Court, they began to complain of Mo|narchy it&s;elf; as a &s;y&s;tem of Government too variable for any regular plan of national ag|grandizement.

fluctuations of a Monarchy. They ob&s;erved, the very &s;mall additions of territory which all the power of France, actuated by all the ambi|tion of France, had acquired in two centuries. The Romans had frequently acquired more in a &s;ingle year. They &s;everely and in every part of it critici&s;ed the reign of Louis the XIVth, who&s;e irregular and de&s;ultory ambition had more provoked than endangered Europe. In|deed, they who will be at the pains of &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;idering the hi&s;tory of that period will &s;ee, that tho&s;e French politicians had &s;ome rea|&s;on. They who will not take the trouble of reviewing it through all it's wars and all it's negociations, will con&s;ult the &s;hort but judicious critici&s;m of the Marquis de Montalambert on that &s;ubject. It may be read &s;eparately from his ingenious &s;y&s;tem of fortification and military defence, on the practical merit of which I am unable to form a judgment.</P>
<P>The diplomatick politicians of whom I &s;peak, and who formed by far the majority in that cla&s;s, made di&s;advantageous compari&s;ons even between their more legal and formali&s;ing Monarchy, and the monarchies of other &s;tates, as a &s;y&s;|tem of power and influence. They ob&s;erved, that France not only lo&s;t ground her&s;elf, but through the languor and un&s;teadine&s;s of her pur|&s;uits,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
and from her aiming through commerce at naval force which &s;he never could attain without lo&s;ing more on one &s;ide than &s;he could gain on the other, three great powers, each of them (as military &s;tates) capable of balancing her, had grown up on the continent. Ru&s;&s;ia and Pru&s;&s;ia had been created almo&s;t within memory; and Au&s;tria, though not a new power, and even cur|tailed in territory, was by the very colli&s;ion in which &s;he lo&s;t that territory, greatly improved in her military di&s;cipline and force. Dur|ing the reign of Maria There&s;a the interior oeconomy of the country was made more to cor|re&s;pond with the &s;upport of great armies than formerly it had been. As to Pru&s;&s;ia, a merely military power, they ob&s;erved that one war had enriched her with as con&s;iderable a conque&s;t as France had acquired in centuries. Ru&s;&s;ia had broken the Turki&s;h power by which Au&s;tria might be, as formerly &s;he had been, balanced in favour of France. They felt it with pain, that the two northern powers of Sweden and Denmark were in general under the &s;way of Ru&s;&s;ia; or that at be&s;t, France kept up a very doubtful conflict, with many fluctuations of fortune, and at an enormous expence in Swe|den. In Holland, the French party &s;eemed, if not extingui&s;hed, at lea&s;t utterly ob&s;cured, and kept under by a Stadtholder, leaning for &s;upport &s;ometimes on Great Britain, &s;ometimes

on Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;ometimes on both, never on France. Even the &s;preading of the Bourbon family had become merely a family accommodation; and had little effect on the national politicks. This alli|ance, they &s;aid, extingui&s;hed Spain by de&s;troying all it's energy, without adding any thing to the real power of France in the acce&s;&s;ion of the forces of it's great rival. In Italy, the &s;ame family accommodation, the &s;ame national in&s;ignificance were equally vi&s;ible. What cure for the radical weakne&s;s of the French Monarchy, to which all the means which wit could devi&s;e, or nature and fortune could be&s;tow, towards univer&s;al empire, was not of force to give life, or vigour, or con&s;i&s;tency,&mdash;but in a republick? Out the word came; and it never went back.</P>
<P>Whether they rea&s;oned right or wrong, or that there was &s;ome mixture of right and wrong in their rea&s;oning, I am &s;ure, that in this man|ner they felt and rea&s;oned. The different ef|fects of a great military and ambitious repub|lick, and of a monarchy of the &s;ame de&s;cription were con&s;tantly in their mouths. The principle was ready to operate when opportunities &s;hould offer, which few of them indeed fore&s;aw in the extent in which they were afterwards pre&s;ented; but the&s;e opportunities, in &s;ome degree or other, they all ardently wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">When I was in Paris in 1773, the treaty of 1756 between Au&s;tria and France was deplored as a national calamity; becau&s;e it united France in friend&s;hip with a Power, at who&s;e expence alone they could hope any continental aggran|dizement. When the fir&s;t partition of Poland was made, in which France had no &s;hare, and which had farther aggrandized every one of the three Powers of which they were mo&s;t jealous, I found them in a perfect phrenzy of rage and indignation: Not that they were hurt at the &s;hocking and uncoloured violence and inju&s;tice of that partition, but at the debility, improvi|dence, and want of activity in their Govern|ment, in not preventing it as a means of aggran|dizement to their rivals, or in not contriving, by exchanges of &s;ome kind or other, to obtain their &s;hare of advantage from that robbery.</P>
<P>In that or nearly in that &s;tate of things and of opinions, came the Au&s;trian match; which promi&s;ed to draw the knot, as after|wards in effect it did, &s;till more clo&s;ely be|tween the old rival hou&s;es. This added ex|ceedingly to their hatred and contempt of their monarchy. It was for this rea&s;on that the late glorious Queen, who on all accounts was formed to produce general love and admiration, and who&s;e life was as mild and beneficent as her death was beyond example great and heroic, be|came

&s;o very &s;oon and &s;o very much the object of an implacable rancour, never to be extin|gui&s;hed but in her blood.

It was accident, and the mo|mentary depre&s;&s;ion of that part of the faction, that gave to the hu&s;band the happy priority in death.</P>
<P>From this their re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of an over-rul|ing influence, they bent a very great part of their de&s;igns and efforts to revive the old French party, which was a democratick party in Holland, and to make a revolution there. They were happy at the troubles which the &s;ingular imprudence of Jo&s;eph the Second had &s;tirred up in the Au&s;|trian Netherlands. They rejoiced, when they &s;aw him irritate his &s;ubjects, profe&s;s philo|&s;ophy, &s;end away the Dutch garri&s;ons, and di&s;mantle his fortifications. As to Holland, they never forgave either the King or the Mini|&s;try, for &s;uffering that object, which they ju&s;tly looked on as principal in their de&s;ign of reduc|ing the power of England, to e&s;cape out of their hands. This was the true &s;ecret of the com|mercial treaty, made, on their part, again&s;t all

the old rules and principles of commerce, with a view of diverting the Engli&s;h nation, by a pur|&s;uit of immediate profit, from an attention to the progre&s;s of France in it's de&s;igns upon that Republic. The &s;y&s;tem of the oeconomi&s;ts, which led to the general opening of commerce, facili|tated that treaty, but did not produce it. They were in de&s;pair when they found that by the vigour of Mr. Pitt, &s;upported in this point by Mr. Fox and the oppo&s;ition, the object, to which they had &s;acrificed their manufactures, was lo&s;t to their ambition.</P>
<P>This eager de&s;ire of rai&s;ing France from the condition into which &s;he had fallen, as they conceived, from her monarchical imbe|cillity, had been the main &s;pring of their prece|dent interference in that unhappy American quarrel, the bad effects of which to this na|tion have not, as yet fully di&s;clo&s;ed them&s;elves. The&s;e &s;entiments had been long lurking in their brea&s;ts, though their views were only di&s;|covered now and then, in heat and as by e&s;capes; but on this occa&s;ion they exploded &s;uddenly. They were profe&s;&s;ed with o&s;tentation, and pro|pagated with zeal. The&s;e &s;entiments were not produced, as &s;ome think, by their American alliance.

The di&s;cour&s;es and cabals that it pro|duced, the intercour&s;e that it e&s;tabli&s;hed, and above all, the example, which made it &s;eem prac|ticable to e&s;tabli&s;h a Republick in a great extent of country, fini&s;hed the work, and gave to that part of the Revolutionary faction a degree of &s;trength, which required other energies than the late King pro&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to re&s;i&s;t, or even to re&s;train. It &s;pread every where; but it was no where more prevalent than in the heart of the Court. The pa|lace of Ver&s;ailles, by it's language, &s;eemed a forum of democracy. To have pointed out to mo&s;t of tho&s;e politicians, from their di&s;po&s;itions and move|ments, what has &s;ince happened, the fall of their own Monarchy, of their own Laws, of their own Religion, would have been to furni&s;h a motive the more for pu&s;hing forward a &s;y&s;tem on which they con&s;idered all the&s;e things&punc; as incumbrances.

<P>When I contemplate the &s;cheme on which France is formed, and when I compare it with the&s;e &s;y&s;tems, with which it is, and ever mu&s;t be in conflict, tho&s;e things which &s;eem as defects in her polity, are the very things which make me tremble. The States of the Chri&s;tian World have grown up to their pre&s;ent magnitude in a

great length of time, and by a great variety of accidents. They have been improved to what we &s;ee them with greater or le&s;s degrees of fe|licity and &s;kill. Not one of them has been formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of de&s;ign. As their Con&s;titutions are not &s;y&s;|tematical, they have not been directed to any <HI>peculiar</HI> end, eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;uper|&s;eding every other. The objects which they em|brace are of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible variety, and have become in a manner infinite. In all the&s;e old countries the &s;tate has been made to the people, and not the people conformed to the &s;tate. Every &s;tate has pur&s;ued, not only every &s;ort of &s;ocial advan|tage, but it has cultivated the welfare of every indi|vidual. His wants, his wi&s;hes, even his ta&s;tes have been con&s;ulted. This comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme, vir|tually produced a degree of per&s;onal liberty in forms the mo&s;t adver&s;e to it. That liberty was found, under monarchies &s;tiled ab&s;olute, in a degree un|known to the ancient commonwealths. From hence the powers of all our modern &s;tates, meet in all their movements, with &s;ome ob&s;truction. It is therefore no wonder, that when the&s;e &s;tates are to be con&s;idered as machines to operate for &s;ome one great end, that this di&s;&s;ipated and balanced force is not ea&s;ily concentred, or made to bear with the whole nation upon one point.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h State is, without que&s;tion, that which pur&s;ues the greate&s;t variety of ends

and is the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice any one of them to another, or to the whole. It aims at taking in the entire circle of human de&s;ires, and &s;ecuring for them their fair enjoyment. Our le|gi&s;lature has been ever clo&s;ely connected, in it's mo&s;t efficient part, with individual feeling and indivi|dual intere&s;t. Per&s;onal liberty, the mo&s;t lively of the&s;e feelings and the mo&s;t important of the&s;e in|tere&s;ts, which in other European countries has rather ari&s;en from the &s;y&s;tem of manners and the habitudes of life, than from the laws of the &s;tate, (in which it flouri&s;hed more from neglect than at|tention) in England, has been a direct object of Government.</P>
<P>On this principle England would be the weake&s;t power in the whole &s;y&s;tem. Fortunately, how|ever, the great riches of this kingdom, ari&s;ing from a vaiety of cau&s;es, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, which is as great to &s;pend as to accu|mulate, has ea&s;ily afforded a di&s;po&s;eable &s;urplus that gives a mighty momentum to the &s;tate. This dif|ficulty, with the&s;e advantages to overcome it, has called &s;orth the talents of the Engli&s;h financiers, who, by the &s;urplus of indu&s;try poured out by pro|digality, have outdone every thing which has been accompli&s;hed in other nations. The pre&s;ent Mi|ni&s;ter has outdone his predece&s;&s;ors; and as a Mini&s;ter of revenue, is far above my power of prai&s;e. But &s;till there are ca&s;es in which Eng|land

<P>France differs e&s;&s;entially from all tho&s;e Govern|ments which are formed without &s;y&s;tem, which exi&s;t by habit, and which are confu&s;ed with the multitude, and with the complexity of their pur|&s;uits. What now &s;tands as Government in France is &s;truck out at a heat. The de&s;ign is wicked, im|moral, impious, oppre&s;&s;ive; but it is &s;pirited and daring; it is &s;y&s;tematick; it is &s;imple in it's princi|ple; it has unity and con&s;i&s;tency in perfection. In that country entirely to cut off a branch of com|merce, to extingui&s;h a manufacture, to de&s;troy the circulation of money, to violate credit, to &s;u&s;pend the cour&s;e of argriculture, even to burn a city, or to lay wa&s;te a province of their own, does not co&s;t them a moment's anxiety. To them, the will, the wi&s;h, the want, the liberty, the toil, the blood of indivi|duals is as nothing. Individuality is left out of their &s;cheme of Government. The &s;tate is all in all. Every thing is referred to the production of force; afterwards every thing is tru&s;ted to the u&s;e of it. It is military in it's principle, in it's maxims, in it's &s;pirit, and in all it's movements. The &s;tate has dominion and conque&s;t for it's &s;ole objects; do|minion over minds by pro&s;elyti&s;m, over bodies by arms.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">Thus con&s;tituted with an immen&s;e body of na|tural means, which are le&s;&s;ened in their amount only to be increa&s;ed in their effect, France has, &s;ince the accompli&s;hment of the Revolution, a complete unity in it's direction. It has de&s;troyed every re&s;ource of the State, which depends upon opinion and the good-will of individuals. The riches of convention di&s;appear. The advantages of nature in &s;ome mea&s;ure remain; even the&s;e, I admit, are a&s;toni&s;hingly le&s;&s;ened; the command ever what remains is complete and ab&s;olute.

di&s;covery is dreadful: the mine exhau&s;tle&s;s. They have every thing to gain, and they have nothing to lo&s;e. They have a boundle&s;s inheritance in hope; and there is no medium for them, betwixt the highe&s;t elevation, and death with infamy. Never can they who from the mi&s;erable &s;ervitude of the de&s;k have been rai&s;ed to Empire, again &s;ubmit to the bondage of a &s;tarving bureau, or the profit of copying mu&s;ic, or writing plaidoyers by the &s;heet.

<P>From all this, what is my inference? It is, that this new &s;y&s;tem of robbery in France, cannot be rendered &s;afe by any art; that it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be de&s;troyed, or that it will de&s;troy all Europe; that to de&s;troy that enemy, by &s;ome means or other, the force op|po&s;ed to it &s;hould be made to bear &s;ome analogy and re&s;emblance to the force and &s;pirit which that &s;y&s;tem exerts; that war ought to be made again&s;t it, in its vulnerable parts.

He had a mo&s;t laudable de&s;ire to &s;upply by general reading, and even by the acqui&s;ition of elemental knowledge, an education in all points originally defective; but nobody told him (and it was no wonder he &s;hould not him&s;elf divine it) that the world of which he read, and the world in which he lived, were no longer the &s;ame. De&s;irous of doing every thing for the be&s;t, fearful of cabal, di&s;tru&s;ting his own judgment, he &s;ought his Mini&s;ters of all kinds upon public te&s;timony.

opinion. In other things he thought that he might be a King on the terms of his predece&s;&s;ors. He was con&s;cious of the purity of his heart and the general good tendency of his Government. He flattered him&s;elf, as mo&s;t men in his &s;ituation will, that he might con&s;ult his ea&s;e without danger to his &s;afety. It is not at all wonderful that both he and his Mini&s;ters, giving way abundantly in other re|&s;pects to innovation, &s;hould take up in policy with the tradition of their monarchy. Under his an|ce&s;tors the Monarchy had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and even been &s;trengthened by the generation or &s;upport of Re|publicks. Fir&s;t, the Swi&s;s Republicks grew un|der the guardian&s;hip of the French Monarchy. The Dutch Republicks were hatched and che|ri&s;hed under the &s;ame incubation. Afterwards, a republican con&s;titution was under it's influence e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Empire again&s;t the preten&s;ions of it's Chief. Even whil&s;t the Monarchy of France, by a &s;eries of wars and negotiations, and la&s;tly by the treaties of We&s;tphalia, had obtained the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tants in Germany as a law of the Empire, the &s;ame Monarchy under Louis the XIIIth, had force enough to de&s;troy the re|publican &s;y&s;tem of the Prote&s;tants at home.</P>
<P>Louis the XVIth was a diligent reader of hi&s;|tory. But the very lamp of prudence blinded him. The guide of human life led him a&s;tray. A &s;ilent revolution in the moral world preceded the politi|cal,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
and prepared it. It became of more impor|tance than ever what examples were given, and what mea&s;ures were adopted. Their cau&s;es no longer lurked in the rece&s;&s;es of cabinets, or in the private con&s;piracies of the factious. They were no longer to be controlled by the force and influ|ence of the grandees, who formerly had been able to &s;tir up troubles by their di&s;contents, and to quiet them by their corruption. The chain of &s;u|bordination, even in cabal and &s;edition, was broken in it's mo&s;t important links. It was no longer the great and the populace. Other intere&s;ts were form|ed, other dependencies, other connexions, other communications. The middle cla&s;&s;es had &s;welled far beyond their former proportion. Like what|ever is the mo&s;t effectively rich and great in &s;ociety, the&s;e cla&s;&s;es became the &s;eat of all the active poli|ticks; and the preponderating weight to decide on them. There were all the energies by which for|tune is acquired; there the con&s;equence of their &s;ucce&s;s. There were all the talents which a&s;&s;ert their preten&s;ions, and are impatient of the place which &s;ettled &s;ociety pre&s;cribes to them. The&s;e de&s;criptions had got between the great and the po|pulace; and the influence on the lower cla&s;&s;es was with them. The &s;pirit of ambition had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of this cla&s;s as violently as ever it had done of any other. They felt the importance of this &s;itua|tion. The corre&s;pondence of the monied and the mercantile world, the literary intercour&s;e of acade|mies;
<PB N="185" REF="186">
but, above all, the pre&s;s, of which they had in a manner, entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, made a kind of electrick communication every where. The pre&s;s, in reali|ty, has made every Government, in it's &s;pirit, al|mo&s;t democratick. Without the great, the fir&s;t movements in this revolution could not, perhaps, have been given. But the &s;pirit of ambition, now for the fir&s;t time connected with the &s;pirit of &s;pe|culation, was not to be re&s;trained at will. There was no longer any means of arre&s;ting a principle in it's cour&s;e. When Louis the XVIth. under the influence of the enemies to Monarchy, meant to found but one Republick, he &s;et up two. When he meant to take away half the crown of his neigh|bour, he lo&s;t the whole of his own. Louis the XVIth could not with impunity countenance a new Republick: yet between his throne and that dangerous lodgment for an enemy, which he had erected, he had the whole Atlantick for a ditch. He had for an out-work the Engli&s;h na|tion it&s;elf, friendly to liberty, adver&s;e to that mode of it. He was &s;urrounded by a rampart of Mo|narchies, mo&s;t of them allied to him, and generally under his influence. Yet even thus &s;ecured, a Republick erected under his au&s;pices, and depen|dent on his power, became fatal to his throne. The very money which he had lent to &s;upport this Republick, by a good faith, which to him operat|ed as perfidy, was punctually paid to his enemies, and became a re&s;ource in the hands of his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">With this example before their eyes, do any Mini&s;ters in England, do any Mini&s;ters in Au|&s;tria, really flatter them&s;elves, that they can erect, not on the remote &s;hores of the Atlantick, but in their view, in their vicinity, in ab&s;olute con|tact with one of them, not a commercial but a martial Republick&mdash;a Republick not of &s;imple hu&s;bandmen or fi&s;hermen, but of intriguers, and of warriors&mdash;a Republick of a character the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s, the mo&s;t enterprizing, the mo&s;t impious, the mo&s;t fierce and bloody, the mo&s;t hypocritical and perfidious, the mo&s;t bold and daring that ever has been &s;een, or indeed that can be conceived to exi&s;t, without bringing on their own certain ruin?</P>
<P>Such is the Republick to which we are going to give a place in civilized fellow&s;hip. The Re|publick, which with joint con&s;ent we are going to e&s;tabli&s;h in the centre of Europe, in a po&s;t that overlooks and commands every other State, and which eminently confronts and menaces this king|dom.</P>
<P>You cannot fail to ob&s;erve, that I &s;peak as if the allied powers were actually con&s;enting, and not com|pelled by events to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this faction in France. The words have not e&s;caped me. You will hereafter naturally expect that I &s;hould make them good. But whether in adopting this mea|&s;ure
<PB N="187" REF="188">
we are madly active, or weakly pa&s;&s;ive, or pu|&s;illanimou&s;ly panick-&s;truck, the effects will be the &s;ame. You may call this faction, which has era|dicated the monarchy,&mdash;expelled the proprietary, per&s;ecuted religion, and trampled upon law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See our declaration.</NOTE>,&mdash;you may call this France if you plea&s;e: but of the ancient France nothing remains; but it's central geography; it's iron frontier; it's &s;pirit of ambition; it's audacity of enterpri&s;e; it's perplex|ing intrigue. The&s;e and the&s;e alone remain; and they remain heightened in their principle and aug|mented in their means. All the former correctives, whether of virtue or of weakne&s;s, which exi&s;ted in the old Monarchy, are gone. No &s;ingle new corrective is to be found in the whole body of the new in&s;ti|tutions. How &s;hould &s;uch a thing be found there, when everything has been cho&s;en with care and &s;elec|tion to forward all tho&s;e ambitious de&s;igns and di&s;|po&s;itions, not to controul them? The whole is a body of ways and means for the &s;upply of domi|nion, without one heterogeneous particle in it.</P>
<P>Here I &s;uffer you to breathe, and leave to your meditation what has occurred to me on the <HI>genius and character</HI> of the French Revolution. From having this before us, we may be better able to deter|mine on the fir&s;t que&s;tion I propo&s;ed, that is, how
<PB N="188" REF="189">
far nations, called foreign, are likely to be affected with the &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed within that territory? I intended to proceed next on the que&s;tion of her fa|cilities, from <HI>the internal &s;tate of other nations, and particularly of this,</HI> for obtaining her ends: but I ought to be aware, that my notions are controvert|ed.&mdash;I mean, therefore, in my next letter, to take notice of what, in that way, has been recommend|ed to me as the mo&s;t de&s;erving of notice. In the examination of tho&s;e pieces, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to di&s;cu&s;s &s;ome others of the topics I have recom|mended to your attention. You know, that the Letters which I now &s;end to the pre&s;s, as well as a part of what is to follow, have been long &s;ince written. A circum&s;tance which your partiality alone could make of importance to you, but which to the publick is of no importance at all, retarded their appearance. The late events which pre&s;s upon us obliged me to make &s;ome few additions; but no &s;ub&s;tantial change in the matter.</P>
<P>This di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, my Friend, will be long. But the matter is &s;erious; and if ever the fate of the world could be truly &s;aid to depend on a particular mea&s;ure, it is upon this peace. For the pre&s;ent, farewel.</P>
