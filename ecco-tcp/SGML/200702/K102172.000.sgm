<Q><HI>He hems, and is deliver'd of his mou&s;e.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WRAPT up in reflection, I long profoundly meditated upon what every body &s;peaks of, and no body under&s;tands&mdash;here &s;ome &s;neerer may perhaps a&s;k me what I meditated upon&mdash;why I medi|tated upon the mo&s;t ob&s;tru&s;e object in nature, to deal plainly with you I meditated upon nothing. Nothing, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, is certainly the mo&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="3">
unfathomable object in metaphy&s;ics, and yet it has a creative faculty; and if we may believe the philo&s;ophical poet of antiquity, is endowed with a power of producing it&s;elf.</P>
<Q><HI>Ex nihilo nihil fit.</HI> <BIBL>LUCRETIUS.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>Nothing mu&s;t come of nothing.</Q>
<P>Trifling, however, as this &s;ubject may appear, nothing has an impor|tance in it&s;elf which the &s;uperficial are not aware of. If we may give credit to &s;ome of the mo&s;t profound philo&s;o|phers, the whole univer&s;e was made out of nothing. Nothing is, accord|ing to them, the &s;ource of all being, and in nothing all being mu&s;t end.
<PB N="3" REF="4">
The greate&s;t of all philo&s;ophers has declared him&s;elf for a vacuum, and a vacuum is certainly a down-right nothing. The more I meditate upon nothing, the more I am convinced of its importance. This &s;ame no|thing has been of great &s;ervice to many an author, I could mention one that has lately filled two whole vo|lumes with nothing; the books va&s;tly dear; but what does it contain? why ju&s;t nothing, and that proves the au|thor's abilities, any blockhead could write if he had &s;omething to &s;ay for him&s;elf; but he that can write upon nothing mu&s;t furely be a &s;uperlative genius. Well, but are not there &s;uch things as religion, virtue, and ho|nour? no, I deny it; and if you wont
<PB N="4" REF="5">
take my <HI>ip&s;e dixit,</HI> the church will &s;hew you that there is nothing in the fir&s;t; the court that there is nothing in the &s;econd; and the army and the navy will fully prove that there is nothing in the third. Well, &s;ome of my impertinent readers may per|haps a&s;k me what I have in view in thus communicating my meditations to the public; why what &s;hould I have in view&mdash;nothing at all&mdash;do but read five or &s;ix pages more, and you'll &s;ee I could have nothing in view. We all were created out of no|thing, and in nothing we all mu&s;t end, according to the &s;y&s;tem of tho&s;e &s;agacious philo&s;ophers, the materiali&s;ts who have di&s;covered that the univer&s;e was made out of nothing, and that nothing pre&s;ides over it.</P>

<HEAD>MEDITATION upon SOMETHING.</HEAD>
<P>LET me now turn my eyes from the va&s;t aby&s;s of non-entity, and fix them a moment upon&mdash;&s;omething. Let metaphy&s;icians &s;ay what they will, &s;omething now mu&s;t certainly exi&s;t, therefore &s;omething mu&s;t have exi&s;ted from all eternity&mdash;pray every day don't we receive convincing proofs of the exi&s;tence of &s;omething. Per|haps my readers may here grow tired of my meditation, &s;o much the wor&s;e for them, for I'll maintain it in &s;pight of the univer&s;e that there is &s;ome|thing in it. Let the &s;agacious reader that may be tempted to think that this meditation turns upon the &s;ame &s;ubject with the former, read only to
<PB N="6" REF="7">
the end of the page, and then h'll &s;ee the difference between &s;omething and nothing. Some of the malignant and cen&s;orious may perhaps here &s;mell a rat&mdash;I think I hear &s;ome of them &s;ay, there mu&s;t be &s;omething at the bottom of this&mdash;he has certainly an ill de&s;ign again&s;t religion or government&mdash;Sir, my intentions are very good, but &s;uch readers as you always find &s;omething to carp at. How ab&s;tract and inex|plicable is the nature of &s;omething&mdash;how hard is &s;omething to be de|fined? how hard is it often to be found out? For in&s;tance now, though every chapter of Tri&s;tram's Life and Opinions teems with &s;omething new and extraordinary, many &s;uperficial readers have been known to &s;ay of it
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&mdash;there may be &s;omething in it, but for my part it e&s;capes me&mdash;gentle|men, that may very well be; but what has been &s;aid of truth, may likewi&s;e be &s;aid of &s;omething, viz. that it lies at the bottom of a well&mdash;and there, gentlemen, it mu&s;t lie till drawn from thence by the bucket of philo&s;ophy.</P>

<HEAD>MEDITATION upon the THING.</HEAD>
<P>I ASCEND &s;till higher and higher in my meditations&mdash;&s;tay awhile, &s;irs, and you &s;hall &s;ee me a&s;cend to the &s;ource where the dim &s;peck of entity began&mdash;here, no doubt, &s;ome lady will interrupt me with a lord, &s;ir, what do you mean? why no mo|de&s;t woman will read you&mdash;oh! fie

the thing. So, madam, you think I mean country-matters, but I had no &s;uch &s;tuff in my thoughts&mdash;The thing here meant is what every reader mu&s;t find in a book, or el&s;e he throws it by, and declares the author to be a damned dull-fellow. You'll perhaps a&s;k me in what it con&s;i&s;ts? why, faith I don't know&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e I was to a&s;k you in what the &s;mell of the violet con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;could you tell me&mdash;you'll doubtle&s;s an&s;wer no&mdash;becau&s;e you are no philo&s;opher&mdash;well, but I am, and yet I really know as little of the mat|ter as you do your&s;elf. Here one of tho&s;e blockheads who have u&s;urped the name of philo&s;opher, would ad|vance with a &s;upercilious air, that the &s;mell of a violet proceeded from cer|tain
<PB N="9" REF="10">
contexture of the &s;mall particles of the flower, which is of a nature to affect the organs of tho&s;e that &s;mell it ju&s;t as it does, and no otherwi&s;e&mdash;But what is this but &s;aying, that it con&s;i&s;ts ju&s;t in the very thing in which it con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;but to return from this di|gre&s;&s;ion to the thing in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It has frequently happened, that a book has been by the public in ge|neral looked upon as the thing&mdash;and has notwith&s;tanding been thought a very bad thing by judicious critics&mdash;but this has never happened to any thing of mine&mdash;whatever I write will by all the world be allowed to be the thing; and if any one &s;hould take upon him to a&s;&s;ert, that this medita|tion
<PB N="10" REF="11">
is not the thing, I mu&s;t beg leave to tell him that he has no ta&s;te&mdash;but this is a digre&s;&s;ion from my &s;ubject&mdash;no matter for that, a di|gre&s;&s;ion is quite the thing in a hi&s;tory, and &s;urely it mu&s;t be much more &s;o in a meditation. What's a medita|tion, but a collection of the reveries of a mind; and what is of a more moving nature than the mind&mdash;&s;o far from thinking in train, it flies from one &s;ubject to another, with a ra|pidity inexpre&s;&s;ible&mdash;from meditating upon the planetary &s;y&s;tem, it can with ea&s;e deviate into a meditation upon hobby-hor&s;es, tho' there does not appear to be any con&s;iderable con|nexion between the ideas&mdash;and yet Hobbs has affirmed, that thoughts have always &s;ome connexion.</P>

<P>BUT come let us quit this ob|&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects, and turn our me|ditations to a &s;ubject which we all under&s;tand&mdash;let us meditate upon the con&s;titution, for every body under &s;tands that, and many a coffee-hou&s;e politician, who would not have a word to &s;ay for him&s;elf, upon &s;omething, nothing, or the thing, can hold forth upon the con&s;titution for half an hour together, and nobody ever the wi&s;er. Can like a clock-maker take down all the &s;prings and wheels of it, and then put them together as they were before. But here I mu&s;t a&s;k the con|&s;titution's pardon for having compared
<PB N="12" REF="13">
it to a clock&mdash;clocks are &s;ometimes down, and 'tis well known that our happy con&s;titution was never liable to any &s;uch accident, though it re&s;em|bles a clock in going &s;ometimes a little too fa&s;t, and &s;ometimes a little too &s;low. Here, perhaps, I may be interrupted by &s;ome impertinent rea|der with a quere, how does it go now?&mdash;Why, Sir Sneerer, it goes exactly right, and how &s;hould it go otherwi&s;e, when wound up by the hand of a Pit. But, alas! while I thus indulge my meditations, and compare the con&s;titution to a clock, I tremble with the apprehen&s;ions of cen&s;ure from another quarter&mdash;Some red-hot theologian may very probably fulminate an anathema again&s;t me, as
<PB N="13" REF="14">
an adopter of the odious &s;y&s;tem of materiali&s;m. But, reader, take my word for it that I am herein accu&s;ed unju&s;tly, as perhaps the author of the &s;pirit of laws was before me. I think &s;pirit as nece&s;&s;ary to move the uni|ver&s;e, as to keep the con&s;titution ago|ing, and make no doubt that if no|thing had exi&s;ted but matter, it would have &s;tood &s;till from all eter|nity. Here, perhaps, the &s;ame &s;neerer may retort upon me, and a&s;k me, with an air of triumph, is there &s;pirit in a clock&mdash;no certainly&mdash;yet we find that motion can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a ma|terial machine. Sir, Sneerer, you &s;eem to have forgot that the clock was made by an intelligent being, and would &s;oon &s;tand &s;till for ever, with|out
<PB N="14" REF="15">
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch an one to wind it up. Your objection will never have any force till the perpetual mo|tion is di&s;covered, and when that is once found out, we may expect to &s;ee a con&s;titution incapable of &s;uffer|ing any revolution. Our glorious con&s;titution has &s;uffered &s;ome, but 'tis now &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed that no true Engli&s;hman can wi&s;h that it &s;hould ever deviate from its pre&s;ent princi|ples. It has been &s;aid indeed of the republic of Venice, that it has been twelve hundred years without a re|volution; and the republics of Italy in general, when they boa&s;t their &s;tabi|lity, boa&s;t only the &s;tability of their corruptions. How far &s;uperior to them is a con&s;titution like ours, or
<PB N="15" REF="16">
like that of ancient Rome, which has &s;truggled through various abu&s;es and revolutions, till it has at la&s;t ac|quired perfection. Here, methinks, I am interrupted by &s;ome phy&s;ician, who tells me, with all the gravitiy of his profe&s;&s;ion, that the body politic re|&s;embles the body natural, which is never more in danger of being &s;eized with an acute di&s;order, than when it enjoys a vigorous &s;tate of health&mdash;this is the ob&s;ervation of no le&s;s a man than the great profe&s;&s;or Boerhaave&mdash;Oh, lord! doctor, you have frightened me out of my wits with your aphori&s;m&mdash;I wi&s;h Boerhaave and you at&mdash;Lord, have mercy upon us, and pre&s;erve us from a &s;tate-fever, 'tis wor&s;e than a &s;tate apoplexy it&s;elf&mdash;but, upon
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;econd thoughts, I apprehend that there is not much danger of a &s;tate|fever, &s;ince the con&s;titution is allowed to be &s;omewhat phlegmatic. But now I talk of phlegm, I have &s;o long meditated upon the con&s;titution, that I can meditate upon it no longer, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pipe of tobacco, and when 'tis lighted, I may, perhaps, re&s;ume my medita|tion; for the aromatic gales of to|bacco, in&s;pire the politician as power|fully as coffee it&s;elf.<Q><L>Ble&s;t leaf who&s;e aromatic gales di&s;pen&s;e,</L>

<HEAD>MEDITATION on TOBACCO.</HEAD>
<P>I Intended to have continued my meditation upon the con&s;titution, but I had not been long wrapt up in the cloudy tabernacle which my tube of clay diffu&s;ed around me, when I was in&s;en&s;ibly led into a train of me|ditations upon the virtues of that leaf, which contributes &s;o much to alleviate the cares of mortals; a &s;ubject which &s;eems to have a con&s;iderable con|nexion with the former, as the con|&s;titution is, upon many accounts, highly indebted to tobacco. Ble&s;t leaf, cried I in an extacy, how ex|ten&s;ive and powerful is thy influence, thou aide&s;t the meditations of the

The politician without thee could not adju&s;t the ballance of Eu|rope to his &s;atisfaction; the publi|can would lo&s;e much of his cu&s;tom; and the bunter his favourite amu&s;e|ment; in fine, were it not for thee the world would have been deprived of many u&s;eful and learned treati&s;es; and what is wor&s;e than all, would never have &s;een this meditation.</P>
<P>Poets &s;eek rural &s;hades and purling &s;treams; but the writer that aims at conveying &s;olid in&s;truction, delights

in tho&s;e modern Lyceums where the fume of tobacco con&s;pires with port, or porter to &s;ugge&s;t ideas, and enlarge the &s;oul. Oh! &s;hame eternal to the Briti&s;h fair, tobacco is their aver&s;ion; but &s;till thou art not entirely aban|doned by the &s;ex; the &s;age dames of Holland &s;moke as much as their hu&s;|bands, and many a Jewe&s;s have I &s;een at Grand Cairo with a pipe in her mouth. Thy importance too is fully acknowledged by mankind, and not without rea&s;on, &s;ince they every day &s;ee we &s;o many enterpri&s;es of great pith and moment vani&s;h into &s;moke. Thy di&s;coveries are likewi&s;e numerous, for is it not u&s;ual to &s;moke the ju&s;tice; to &s;moke the par&s;on; to &s;moke the je&s;t; and, in fine, to &s;moke
<PB N="20" REF="21">
every thing that has any thing in it to be &s;moked; in&s;omuch, that the cobler him&s;elf has not e&s;caped being &s;moked. Here the critics may, per|haps, cry out damn'd dull; but let them look to it, for &s;hould they pre|tend to cen&s;ure my meditations, I'll make the critics &s;moke. Tobacco! thou mo&s;t grateful incen&s;e to the gods in the upper gallery, without thee how in&s;ipid would be the character of Abel Drugger&mdash;how ta&s;tele&s;s would be wine, punch, and porter without thee? 'Twas a maxim with the an|cients, that <HI>&s;ine Baccho, friget Venus,</HI> that love is cold without wine; but how much more ju&s;t is the maxim, that wine is cold without tobacco? Oh, doubly a friend to conver&s;ation!
<PB N="21" REF="22">
thou opene&s;t the heart to &s;ocial con|ver&s;e, and do&s;t, at the &s;ame time, afford relief to the man of few words, by furni&s;hing him with an excu&s;e for his taciturnity. Oh! friend to learn|ing and the mu&s;es, by thee the Ox|ford &s;cholar is as much edified as by Ramus or Smigle&s;uco, and perhaps much more. The great Socrates, and the divine Plato, were but mean phi|lo&s;ophers with all their learning, nor &s;hould we wonder at it, there was no tobacco &s;moked in their ages, that would have exalted their conceptions, and rai&s;ed their &s;ouls to the mo&s;t &s;ub|lime contemplations. What honour then is due to the glorious memory of Lane, who fir&s;t introduced the u&s;e of the divine leaf into this our country.

Wrapt up in &s;moke, and in this plea|&s;ing theme, I could with plea&s;ure dwell upon it till to-morrow morning, but I mu&s;t quit my &s;ubject, though much again&s;t my will, for hark, the bell &s;ounds, my candle is burnt out, and I have not &s;o much as a flint to &s;trike a light, &s;o I mu&s;t go to bed, and there dream or meditate till to-morrow.</P>

<HEAD>MEDITATION on NOSES.</HEAD>
<P>FROM meditating upon tobacco, which I con&s;idered in one of its u&s;es only, I was in&s;en&s;ibly led to me|ditate upon &s;nuff, which, with &s;uch propriety, become the no&s;es of the nobility and gentry, but my attention was &s;oon called off from this object to the con&s;ideration of &s;omething of much greater importance, I mean the no&s;e it&s;elf. It was formerly cu&s;to|mary to judge of a man's under&s;tand|ing by his no&s;e,
<Q>Homo emuncti naris, <BIBL>&s;ays HORACE.</BIBL></Q>
And in another place,
<Q>Minus aptus acutis naribus horum hominum,</Q>
<PB N="24" REF="25">
&s;o that a &s;harp no&s;e was at that time the &s;ign of wit. The no&s;e has in other ages and nations been artificially made to denote profound wi&s;dom and gravity, by the application of a pair of &s;pectacles to it. The young men of Bologna in Italy thus equalled the doctors in the gravity of their out|&s;ide, and 'tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they took particular care of that part, &s;ince it would have been a great mi&s;|fortune to have had nothing to hang a pair of &s;pectacles upon. Oh, im|portant member! the &s;ymbol of wit and under&s;tanding, of wi&s;dom and gravity, would thy importance were better known, for oft with dire di&s;|grace the no&s;e falls off, &s;apped by the
<PB N="25" REF="26">
unrelenting rage of Syphilis, and thus the human countenance lo&s;es its chiefe&s;t ornament. Could Talicotius ri&s;e once more, he'd have as many cu&s;tomers as ever; but, alas! &s;o ex|traordinary a genius is but &s;eldom &s;een.&mdash;Here, methinks, &s;ome &s;neer|ing Critic turns up his no&s;e at me, and a&s;ks me what all this pompous exordium tends to? Why, pray Mr. Critic, can my language be too &s;ub|lime in &s;peaking of the no&s;e? when Solomon him&s;elf has compared the no&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s to mount Leba|non; and when heaven it&s;elf has a no&s;e, if we may believe the divine Shake&s;pear:
<Q>Heaven &s;tops the no&s;e at it.
<BIBL>OTHELLO.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Mu&s;t we not be fully &s;atisfied of the importance of the no&s;e, &s;ince &s;ure that part mu&s;t be the &s;eat of honour. That 'tis the &s;eat of honour none can doubt, as he that has been pulled by it, lo&s;es all preten&s;ions to that quality. 'Tis true, indeed, another part of the body (which for obvious rea&s;ons I &s;hall not name, though a celebrated wit of the la&s;t age, &s;worn foe to inde|cency and irreligion, has taken plea|&s;ure to dwell upon it) has di&s;puted this di&s;tinction with the no&s;e, ju&s;t as the &s;eat of the &s;oul has been a mat|ter of controver&s;y among philo&s;ophers. De&s;cartes placing it in the pineal gland, others in the <HI>corpus callo&s;um,</HI> others in the <HI>medulla oblongata, &amp;c. Non no&s;trum e&s;t tantas componere lites;</HI>

let others decide whether honour be &s;eated in the no&s;e, or el&s;ewhere, &s;ure I am it mu&s;t be &s;eated &s;omewhere. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion into the high road of my meditation, which is a very ea&s;y matter, &s;ince I have nothing to do but follow my no&s;e, which will not fail to mar&s;hal me the way that I am going. Come on then, lets follow its guidance without being terrified at the old proverb, he that follows his no&s;e may be led into a &s;tink&mdash;the no&s;e is the gnomon of the face, and often directs us in as unerring a manner, as the &s;hadow points to the hours upon a &s;un-dial. Cromwell him&s;elf has told us, that a man never mounts &s;o high
<PB N="28" REF="29">
as when he does not know where he's going; and &s;urely when a man goes on without knowing where he's going, he may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to follow his no&s;e. Oh, no&s;e! thou tru&s;ty guide of half mankind, &s;ome of the greate&s;t heroes have acknowledged thee to be their only conductor. Peter the Great, Charles the Twelfth, and William the Third of glorious and immortal me|mory, adhered to the &s;y&s;tem of an ab&s;olute fatality, and entirely di&s;be|lieved that men were ma&s;ters of any of their actions. What el&s;e was this but to own that they had all their lives followed their no&s;e. Oh! mor|tals, who too often wander from the way follow your no&s;es, for by giving
<PB N="29" REF="30">
your&s;elves up entirely to their gui|dance, you will, at lea&s;t, e&s;cape the mortification of having others lead you by them. To follow one's no&s;e, mu&s;t &s;ure be to take the right way; &s;ince to follow one's no&s;e is to go right on&mdash;Here &s;ome reader who idolizes variety, and can't bear to dwell for a few moments upon the &s;ame thought, may very probably &s;ay this author has &s;o long followed his no&s;e, that I am tired of following him, and &s;o throw down the book&mdash;pray, Sir, take it up again, you &s;hall &s;oon have &s;omething new&mdash;I love va|riety as well as your&s;elf, and can't bear to go on a long time in the &s;ame beaten track. I &s;hall have my diverti|cular

'Tis &s;trange, but at the &s;ame time true, that tho&s;e who fir&s;t give occa&s;ion to our coming into this &s;curvy and di&s;a&s;terous world, &s;hould think that they are more entitled to our gratitude, than tho&s;e that prevent our receiving any injury at coming into it, and tho&s;e that take care of us during our mo&s;t helple&s;s &s;tate after we are come into it. Well, but are midwives nece&s;&s;ary only at our birth&mdash;quite the rever&s;e&mdash;at lea&s;t, 'tis &s;o with re&s;pect to us authors, for I find my head even now labouring with a thought; and I could wi&s;h &s;ome ju|dicious critic would lend his kind ob|&s;tetric hand to help to deliver me of it&mdash;if none &s;hould, it mu&s;t even leap

But to what purpo&s;e do you thus bring in your bull by the head and &s;houlders? you &s;hould have taken hold of it by the horns, as Her|cules did his.

expo&s;e, what none but a hu&s;band &s;hould &s;ee&s;t, to the view of anohter man, with as little concern as they would &s;how their faces.

If ima|gination may trace the noble du&s;t of Alexander, till it find it &s;topping a bung-whole, why may not imagination trace that very Alexander, who con|quered at I&s;&s;us, Arbela, and Granicus, and who carried his pre&s;umption &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ume the title of &s;on of Jupiter Ammon, and cau&s;e &s;tatutes to be erected to him as a god? why may

not imagination trace that very Alex|ander, till it perceives him an ho|munculus in the genitalia of Philip, or, which &s;eems rather more probable, of one of Philip's dome&s;tics.

of braving it&mdash;the king of Per|&s;ia's purpo&s;e would have been much better an&s;wered, had he kept a per|&s;on to addre&s;s him every morning in the&s;e words&mdash;Oh! king of Per&s;ia, re|member thou wert once an homun|culus. What theologian can give a better argument for humility&mdash;'tis no longer nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider men as pi&s;mires crawling upon a heap of dirt, we know that in effect they all were formerly animalcula; and &s;ince man was originally a worm, well may we, with holy Job, &s;ay to corruption, thou art my father; and to the worm, thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter.

I &s;hall
<PB N="67" REF="76">
an&s;wer your que&s;tion, Sir, by telling you a &s;tory, 'tis very po&s;&s;ible you may not have heard, as critics now a days are not very knowing, that a certain philo&s;opher (I really have forgot his name) went about the &s;treets of Athens with &s;omething hid under his cloak, and being a&s;ked by an imper|tinent pa&s;&s;enger (Sir, I a&s;k pardon) what he concealed under his cloak? an&s;wered, with all the compo&s;ure of a philo&s;opher, I hide it that you may not know. In like manner, I, Mr. Critic, write that I may not be under|&s;tood. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that men have but two ends in view in &s;peaking or writing, <HI>viz.</HI> to make others under&s;tand their meaning, or el&s;e to keep their meaning concealed.
<PB N="68" REF="77">
I have generally the latter in view when I write. Ob&s;curity was always my idol, and &s;urely great mu&s;t be its excellence, &s;ince one of its greate&s;t enemies has been obliged to acknow|ledge, that 'tis the characteri&s;tic of a &s;illy man and a &s;illy book to be ea&s;ily &s;een through. It follows then of cour&s;e, that ob&s;curity is the characte|ri&s;tic of a wi&s;eman and a &s;hrewd book. To what did all the &s;ages of antiquity, who &s;o long governed man|kind by their &s;uperiority of intellects, owe their &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;to ob&s;curity?&mdash;In what does the whole merit of a riddle con&s;i&s;t in, ob&s;curity?&mdash;To what do the &s;tars owe all their brightne&s;s? to the ob&s;curity of the firmament? And in fine, what mu&s;t the renown of the
<PB N="69" REF="78">

<P>To what does antiquity owe all the veneration that is paid to it&mdash;to the ob&s;curity of its origin? The ancient Greeks and Romans were perhaps neither better nor wi&s;er than the mo|derns; but they lived long before them, and are con&s;equently le&s;s known, therefore they are mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and this e&s;teem they owe to their antiquity alone. Now be|tween antiquity and ob&s;curity the con|nexion is obvious. Why are dead languages more in repute than the living? the rea&s;ons plain, they are more ob&s;cure. To what does the ma|thematician owe all the plea&s;ure he

In fine, the &s;ciences which are looked upon as mo&s;t important, are, by way of ex|cellence, denominated ab&s;tra&s;e &s;ciences, and this &s;ufficiently evinces the great merit of ob&s;curity.</P>

All I know of it is, that it is &s;omething made by na|ture in a game&s;ome mood; for dame nature has her frolicks as well as other females. The virtuo&s;o is &s;mitten with works of art as well as nature, and
<PB N="93" REF="102">
painters, fidlers, architects, &s;tatuaries have no greater benefactors than men of fortune who profe&s;s virt&uacute;. The&s;e are as favourable to the race of arti&s;ts as de&s;tructive to frogs and glew|worms. Some may perhaps infer, that I put arti&s;ts upon a level with in|&s;ects, that is far from my thoughts, I always e&s;teem the arts, and when I de&s;pi&s;e an arti&s;t 'tis not on account of his art. His whole excellence often con&s;i&s;ts in that; and I have known many an excellent fidler, who when he had cea&s;ed playing was fit for no|thing but to be &s;hut up in a ca&s;e, like his in&s;trument. From arti&s;ts, let us return to the encouragers of arts. How is the public obliged to tho&s;e generous noblemen, who, by their &s;ub&s;criptions,
<PB N="94" REF="103">
&s;upport the Italian opera among&s;t us? and how much is their genero&s;ity en|hanced by the con&s;ideration, that per|haps not three of them under&s;tand the language of the performers? This may by &s;ome be thought to reflect upon their ta&s;te; but in my opinion, it &s;hould give us the mo&s;t advantage|ous idea of it; for &s;urely it mu&s;t re|quire more ta&s;te to be plea&s;ed with a tune, when one does not under&s;tand the words of a &s;ong, then when one does. Our noble virtuo&s;i mu&s;t be ac|knowledged to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of all other countries in ta&s;te, though it has been maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuated by &s;ome, that they have often bought pictures as pieces of Guido, Raphael, &amp;c. when they were no more done by
<PB N="95" REF="104">
them than by Protegenes or Apelles. But this even &s;uppo&s;ing it true, proves nothing at all again&s;t the ju&s;tne&s;s of their ta&s;te. Did not Michael Angelo take in all the connai&s;&s;eurs of Italy by his &s;tatue of Cupid, which they per|&s;i&s;ted in looking upon as an antique, till he produced the arm which he had cut off, before he buried it in the ruins of an ancient temple? Did not Muretus impo&s;e upon that great critic Scaliger, by an imitation of the an|cient comic poets, which the latter, with all his &s;agacity, cited as a pa&s;&s;age of Trabea? But to put the ta&s;te of our nobility and gentry out of all di&s;|pute, does not the unparallel'd en|couragement they have given to the life and opinions of Tri&s;tram Shandy,

&s;ufficiently evince, that they are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t di&s;cernment?</P>

<HEAD>MEDITATION upon CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a fa&s;hionable &s;ubject, I am led I know not how to me|ditate upon one that &s;eems to be grown quite out of fa&s;hion. Con|&s;cience has long &s;ince been kicked out of doors by honour, which &s;up|plies its place among&s;t people of qua|lity, whil&s;t con&s;cience is obliged to fly for refuge to the vulgar, and is well off if he can find a refuge even there. Tho&s;e in low life generally take after their betters, in&s;omuch, that many &s;hop|keepers have excluded con&s;cience as a trouble&s;ome companion. Several trade&s;|men
<PB N="97" REF="106">
I could name who have made fortunes by u&s;ing con&s;cience as their coin. Con&s;cience has &s;ometimes been known to make cowards in the army and navy; and if we may believe the poet, it makes cowards of us all. Legi&s;lators have in all ages found it a mo&s;t convenient &s;care-crow, and would never have been able to lead whole nations as they have done, if they had not taken men by their weak &s;ide, I mean by their con&s;cience. By mold|ing this at their plea&s;ure they have made people act and think as they plea&s;ed, and it was no hard matter for them to mold it at di&s;cretion, as 'tis of a very flexible nature in the vulgar and ignorant, who finding it difficult to think for them&s;elves, are glad to
<PB N="98" REF="107">
throw that weight upon other's &s;houlders.</P>
<P>In Roman catholic countries the in&s;ufficiency of con&s;cience to direct the actions of men has been &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly felt, that nobody thinks him&s;elf obliged to watch over his own con|&s;cience, but that affair is left to the management of confe&s;&s;ors and direc|tors. Ca&s;uits have been of great &s;er|vice to people of tender con&s;ciences, by marking out the limitations of each virtue, and &s;hewing men how little good they might do, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve a good con&s;cience; but I &s;hall here fini&s;h my meditation, as I have already &s;aid enough in all con|&s;cience on this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>WHAT great atchievements does not drunkenne&s;s give occa&s;ion to? How many admirable pieces of poetry? how many flights of fancy does drunkenne&s;s pro|duce? Oh! thou invi&s;ible &s;pirit of wine, if we have no other name to call thee by, let us call thee mu&s;e, for &s;ure it is, that more bards have been in&s;pired by thee, than by drink|ing the waters of Helicon. But thy influence is not confined to poets alone, divines and philo&s;ophers do not di&s;dain thy &s;uccour. Cato the cen&s;or,
<PB N="100" REF="109">
was no foe to good wine, and the ro|tation of the earth was fir&s;t di&s;covered by a philo&s;opher intoxicated with li|quor. No water-drinker, if we may believe Horace, ever compo&s;ed an immortal poem, and the man that has a real genius for poetry is always
<Q>Rit&egrave; cliens Bacchi &s;omno gaudentis &amp; umbra.</Q></P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t prelates the church of Rome ever produced, has compared the joys of heaven to ebriety; and all the difference he makes between happy &s;ouls and drunken men is, that the ebriety of the former is continual, that of the latter temporary. Ebriety bani&s;hes all cares from human brea&s;ts, and &s;uch is
<PB N="101" REF="110">
its efficacy, that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of it:
<Q><L>Kings it makes gods,</L>
<L>And meaner creatures kings.</L></Q>
Add to this, that orthodoxy and drink|ing go together&mdash;whil&s;t Turks damn them&s;elves over a di&s;h of coffee, the chri&s;tian divine makes his countenance chearful with good port. Let the treacherous Spaniard con&s;ider the term Borrachio, or drunkard, as a term of the highe&s;t reproach; among&s;t the free-born &s;ons of Great-Britain, drunk|ard and good-fellow will always be looked upon as &s;ynonimous terms. To compleat the panegyric, wine ba|ni&s;hes care, in&s;pires the human brea&s;t with hope, adds wings to the fancy,
<PB N="102" REF="111">
and exalts the genius. It has always been found the be&s;t friend in times of grief, and the be&s;t companion in times of pro&s;perity. But who can call its virtues in que&s;tion, that knows that the renowned Alexander, the conqueror of the world, was the greate&s;t drinker of his age, and was an over-match for his contemporaries over a bottle, as well as for his ene|mies in the field. His death has fal&s;ly been a&s;cribed to the juice of the grape, 'twas cau&s;ed by poi&s;on. Had it not been for that he might have lived to drink till his body had been &s;o &s;welled with a drop&s;y, that it could not have been contained in a coffin. But as Juvenal &s;ays,

Pray, why, Sir? why, becau&s;e he had not drank enough. Here &s;ome critic interrupts me as u&s;ual.

<P>ABARREN &s;ubject this; but Yorick has &s;omething to &s;ay upon every &s;ubject, or if he &s;hould have nothing to &s;ay upon it, the defi|ciency is ea&s;ily &s;upplied by a digre&s;|&s;ion. A digre&s;&s;ion is as u&s;eful to one of us writers of meditations, as a <HI>&s;uc|cedanum</HI> to an apothecary, and the reader and patient are equally apt to take one thing for another. Of all the various lights in which the rela|tion of author and reader have been con&s;idered, I know none &s;o well adapted to give an adequate idea of them, as this of doctor and patient,

or apothecary and patient, for doctor and apothecary are all one. Readers &s;eldom &s;it down to read books, but when they are troubled with the &s;pleen, when the time hangs heavy on their heads, or when they have &s;ome in|di&s;po&s;ition or other, which makes them incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s, or any more lively plea&s;ure. 'Tis then they take up a book of amu&s;ement, and their author may be ju&s;tly looked up|on as their phy&s;ician. What &s;hews &s;till farther the ju&s;tne&s;s of this com|pari&s;on is the following in&s;cription, over the door of Ptolomy Philadel|phus's famous library at Alexandria,
